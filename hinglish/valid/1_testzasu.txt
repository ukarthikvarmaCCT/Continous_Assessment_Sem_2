 It was spoken from Bihar in the east to haryana-rajasthan in the west and nepal-uttar Pradesh in the north to Madhya Pradesh in the south
 bhagwaan buddha bhi inhen pradesho main viharan karte hue logon ko dharm samajhaate rahe
 Today Hindi is spoken in these regions
 isliye, paali pracheen hindi he
 It is a dialect or Prakrit in the indo-european language family
 isko buddha tripitak kii bhashaa ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Pali was written in the scripts of the Brahmi family
 pali shabd kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke naanaa mat paae jate hai
 Some have tried to generate it from the word text and some from the pyad
 ek german vidvan maiks vailaser ne pali ko 'patli' kaa sankshipt rup bataakar yah mat vyakt kiya he ki uskaa arth patliputra kii pracheen bhashaa se he
 One of the two opinions that scholars have more inclination towards than these derivatives, is the opinion of Pt
 Vidushekhar Bhattacharya, according to which the word Pali is derived from the line
 is mat kaa prabal samarthan ek pracheen pali kosh abhidhanppadipika se hota he, kyonki usamen tanti, buddhavachan, panti or pali in shabdon me bhi spasht hi pali kaa arth pankti hi he
 The usage of Pali found in the above two meanings also proves meaningful in this sense
 buddhavachanon kii pankti yaa paath kii pankti kaa arth buddhaghosh ke prayogon main baith jaataa he
 However, according to phonology, derivation of Pali cannot be derived from the word line
 uski apeksha pankti ke arth main prachlit deshi shabd pali, paathth, padu se hi is shabd kaa sabandh jodna adhik upyukt prathit hota he
 The word Pali is also found to be prevalent in Sanskrit
 abhidhanppadipika main jo pali kii vyutpatti "paaleti rakkhtiti pali", is prakaar batalaai gai he usase bhi is mat kaa samarthan hota he
 But the monk Jagdish Kashyapa, the doer of "pali Mahavikaran", has raised some objections about taking Pali in the sense of line and has tried to explain it derived from the word 'pariyya' used in many places in the original Tripitaka texts
 samrat ashok ke bhabru shilaalekh main tripitak ke 'dhammpariyaay' shabd sthaan par magadhi pravriti ke anusaar 'dhamm paliyaay' shabd kaa prayog paaya jaataa he, jiskaa arth buddha-upadesh yaa vachan hota he
 According to Kashyap Ji, Pali was derived from this palyaan refuge
 mul tripitak main bhashaa kaa kahin koi naam nahin miltaa
 But Buddhaghosha etc
 Acharyas have called the language of Buddha's teachings as Magadhi
 visuddhimagg evam mahavans main is magadhi ko sab praaniyon kii mulbhasha kaha gaya he
 The use of the word Pali is not usually found before the 14th century AD
 haan, buddhaghosh ne apni atthakathaon main pali shabd kaa prayog kiya he, kintu yah bhashaa ke arth main nahin, buddhavachan athwa mooltripitak ke paath ke arth main kiya he or vah bhi praaia: us paath ko atthkatha se bhinn dikhalaane ke liye
 Thus somewhere he has said that its policy is like this, but it is so in the story, or it is neither in the policy nor in the story
 buddhaghosh ke samay se kuch purv likhe gaye dipawans main tathaa unke pashchaatkaaleen mahavans aadi rachanaaon main bhi pali shabd kaa inhen do arthon main prayog kiya gaya paaya jaataa he
 With the same meaning, the word Pali started being used for that literature and its language respectively
 bhashaa kii drushti se pali us madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha kaa ek rup he jiskaa vikaas lagbhag i
pus
 chhathi shatee se mana jaataa he
 Prior to that, the form of the ancient Indian Aryabhasha is found in the Vedas and the Brahmins, Upanishads and texts of Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc
, which are called 'vedic language' and 'sanskrit language'
 vaidic bhashaa evam sanskrit kii apeksha madhyakaalin bhashaaon kaa bhed pramukhataa se nimna baton main paaya jaataa he : Grammatically ye visheshtaayen madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha ke saamaanya lakshan hai or desh kii un lokbhashaon main paae jate hai jinka suprachaar ukt avadhi se koi do hajaar varsh tak rahaa or jinka bahut-sa sahitya bhi uplabdh he
 Apart from the above general characteristics, there are many differences in these languages as compared to their country and time
 kaal kii drushti se unke teen str maane gaye hai - The languages of all these eras have been given a common name Prakrit
 iske pratham str ko bhashaaon kaa swaroop ashok kii prashastiyon tathaa pali sahitya main praapt hota he
 Among the second level languages are Magadhi, Ardhamagadhi, Shaurseni and Maharashtri Prakrit languages whose rich literature is available
 tritiy str kii bhashaaon ko apbhransh ev avahatth naam die gaye hai
 The earliest introduction to the distinction of medieval languages is found in the scriptures of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka
 inamen teen pradeshbhed spasht hai - purvi, pashchimi or pashchimottaree
 The form of the Eastern language appears in the commendations of Dhauli and Jaugarh
 inamen r ke sthaan par l tathaa aakarant shabdon ke kartakarak ekvachan kii vibhakti e supratishthit he
 The grammar of Prakrit has counted these tendencies in the characteristic features of the Magadhi Prakrit
 vaiyakarnon ke matanusaar is magadhi praakrit kaa teesraa vishesh lakshan teenon ooshm varnon ke sthaan par sh kaa prayog he
 But this trend is not found in the above articles of Ashoka, because it is used here instead of three heaters
 isi kaaran ashok kii is purvi praakrit ko magadhi na kahkar ardhamagadhi kaa pracheen rup kahana adhik upyukt he
 Girnar commendations are among those representing the Western language distinction
 inamen r or l kaa bhed surakshit he
 Sc is used in place of thermodynamics and the causative factor ends in the singular form o
 in pravritiyon se spasht he ki yah bhashaa shauraseni kaa pracheen rup he
 The form of the Northwestern language appears in the commendations of Shahbazgarhi and Mansera
 inamen praaia: sh, sh, s ye teenon ooshm varna apane sthaan par surakshit hai
 Some obsessions are visible at some places
 rakaryukt sanyuktavarna bhi dikhaai dete hai, tathaa jna or nya ke sthaan par ranna, kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 These trends indicate that language is an earlier form of paischi prakrit
 pali tripitak kaa kuch bhaag avashya hi ashok ke kaal main saahitiyik rup dhaaran kar chukaa tha kyonki uske lahulovad, moneysutt aadi saat prakarnon kaa ullekh unki bhabru kii prashasti main hua he
 But in the language of available literature, the language related features of Ashoka's eastern inscription are often lacking
 vyapak rup se pali bhashaa kaa swaroop girnaar prashasti kii bhashaa se sarvaadhik mail khaataa he or isi kaaran pali mulat: purvadeshiy nahin, kintu madhyadeshiy he
 The feature that makes Pali the first level of medieval Indian Aryan Bhasha, not the second, is the lack of intermediate decadent consonants and the order of h in place of Mahaprana Varna
 ye pravritiyaan dwitiya str kii bhashaaon ke saamaanya lakshan hai
 Yes, somewhere in place of the negative characters such as the name of the dark characters, etc
 appears
 kintu yah ek to alpamaatra main hi he or duusare vah pratham str kii ukt maryaada ke bheetar apekshaakrit pashchaatkaal kii pravriti kaa dyotak he
 With regard to the Pali language and the medieval Indian Aryan languages, it is important to note that the Sanskrit language which is believed to be from Sanskrit is not correct
 yatharthat: vedikakaal se hi saahitiyik bhashaa ke saath saath usase milti julati lokbhasha ne desh evam kalbhedanusaar saahitiyik praakrit bhashaaon kaa rup dhaaran kiya he
 Pali is also not taking its entire heritage from Sanskrit, because its word forms are found in such a way that it does not match Sanskrit but with the language of the Vedas
 udaahranarth- pali evam anya prakriton main tritiya bahuvachan ke deverbhi, devehi, jaise rup milte hai
 Such forms of non-formative nouns are completely lacking in Sanskrit, but Devearbhi in Vedic is as well-known as Devaैī
 atev ukt rup kii parampara pali tathaa prakriton main vaidic bhashaa se hi udbhoot maani ja sakati he
 Similarly, in Pali, 'yamamase', 'masre', 'katwe', etc
 are many forms whose suffixes are not found in Sanskrit, but are present in Vedic language
 pali ke granthon tathaa ashok kii prashastiyon se purv kaa praakrit main likhit sahitya uplabdh nahin he tathaa praakrit vaiyakarnon ne apni suvidha ke liye sanskrit ko prakruti maanakar praakrit bhashaa kaa vyakarnatmak vishleshan kiya he or isiilie yah bhranti utpann ho gai he ki praakrit bhashaaon kii utpatti sanskrit se hui
 This flaw is not found in Pali's Kachchan, Moggallan etc
 grammar, because Sanskrit was not described as a standard of nature

 and unexpected mineral property was extracted from the land; It is the slave system that has helped the United States to become the world's leader in capitalist and industrial progress; And slavery has had the most significant impact in the political history of the United States, because the nation has been divided by going through a fierce civil war on the question of slavery

 Mohammad Rafi was born on 24 December 1924 near Kotla Sultan Singh, Amritsar
 aarambhik balykaal main hi inkaa parivaar lahore se amritsar aa gaya
 His family had nothing to do with music
 jab rafi chote the tab inke bade bhai kii nai dukaan thi, rafi kaa kaaphi vakt vahiin par gujarata tha
 It is said that when Rafi was seven years old, he followed a fakir passing through his elder brother's shop who used to sing from there
 uski aawaaj rafi ko pasand ai or rafi uski nakal kiya karte the
 People also liked his voice after seeing avalata in his copy
 log nai dukaan main unke gane kii prashansha karne lage
 But Rafi got nothing but local fame from this
 inke bade bhai mohammad hamid ne inke sangeet ke prati inaki ruchi ko dekha or unhen ustad abdul vaahid khan ke paas sangeet shiksha lene ko kaha
 Once Akashwani came to Lahore to perform his famous singer-actor Kundan Lal Sehgal
 isko sunne hetu mohammad rafi or unke bade bhai bhi gaye the
 Sehgal refused to sing due to the power failure
 rafi ke bade bhai ne aayojakon se nivedan kiya kii bheed kii vyagrata ko shant karne ke liye mohammad rafi ko gane kaa mauka diya jaay
 He got permission and this was Mohammad Rafi's first public performance at the age of 13
 prekshkon main shyaam sundar, jo us samay ke prasiddh sangeetkaar the, ne bhi unako suna or kaaphi prabhavit hue
 He invited Mohammad Rafi to sing for himself
 mohammad rafi kaa pratham geet ek punjabi film gul baloch ke liye tha jise unhone shyaam sundar ke nirdesan main 1944 main gaaya
 In 1946, Mohammad Rafi decided to come to Bombay
 unhen sangeetkaar naushaad ne pehle aap naam kii film main gane kaa mauka diya
 Rafi got fame in the Hindi world for the first time with the song Tera Toy Broken by Naushad
 iske baad shahid, mela tathaa dulaari main bhi rafi ne gane gaae jo bahut prasiddh hue
 In 1951, when Naushad was composing songs for the film Baiju Bawra, he thought of losing his favorite singer Talat Mehmood
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone ek baar talat mahmud ko dhumrapaan karte dekhakar apana man badal liya or rafi se gane ko kaha
 Baiju Bawra's songs established Rafi as a mainstream singer
 iske baad naushaad ne rafi ko apane nirdesan main kai geet gane ko die
 Around this time, the composer duo shankar-jaikishan liked his voice and also started singing songs from Rafi
 shankar jaykishan us samay raaj kapur ke pasandida sangeetkaar the, par raaj kapur apane liye sirf mukesh kii aawaaj pasand karte the
 Later, when the demand for Shankar Jaikishan's songs increased, he used Rafi Sahab almost everywhere
 yahan tak kii kai baar raaj kapur ke liye rafee sahab ne gaaya
 Soon, music composer Sachin Dev Burman and notably OP Nayyar got very pleased with Rafi's voice and started singing Rafi
 o pi naiyyar kaa naam isamen smaraneey rahegaa kyonki unhone apane niraale andaaj main rafi-aashaa kii jodi kaa kaaphi prayog kiya or unki khanakati dhune aaj bhi us jamaane ke anya sangeetkaaron se alag prathit hoti hai
 Rafi gained a lot of fame with the songs sung under his direction and then became the first choice of composers like Ravi, Madan Mohan, Ghulam Haider, Jaydev, Salil Chaudhary, etc
 dilip kumaar, bharat bhushan tathaa devanand jaise kalakaaron ke liye gane ke baad unke gaanon par abhinay karne waalo kalakaaron kii suchi badhati gai
 For artists like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Joy Mukherjee, Vishwajeet, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra etc
 Rafi's voice started echoing in the background
 shammi kapur to rafi kii aawaaj se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone apane har gane main rafi kaa istemaal kiya
 While OP Nayyar gave music for him, Shankar Jaikishan sometimes voiced his voice
 chaahe koi mujhe junglee kahe, ehsaan tera hoga mujhapar, ye chand sa roshan cheharaa, divaana hua badal shammi kapur ke upar filmaae gaye lokapriy gaanon main shaamil hai
 Gradually, his fame grew so much that actors started urging him to sing the song
 rajendra kumaar, dilip kumaar or dharmendra to maanate hi nahin the ki koi or gayak unke liye gaae
 
 1950 ke dashak main shankar jaykishan, naushaad tathaa sachindev burman ne rafi se us samay ke bahut lokapriy geet gavaaye
 This trend continued into the 1960s
 sangeetkaar ravi ne mohammad rafi kaa istemaal 1960 ke dashak main kiya
 In 1960, Rafi received his first Filmfare Award for the title song of the movie Chaudhvi Ka Chand
 iske baad gharaana, kaajal, do badan tathaa neelkamal jaisi filmo main in dono kii jodi ne kai yaadgaar nagamen die
 In 1961 Rafi got his second Filmfare Award for Sasural's song Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko
 sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant pyarelal ne apana aagaaz hi rafi ke swar se kiya or 1963 main film parasmani ke liye bahut sundar geet banaae
 Be safe in these and it is remarkable when remembered
 1965 main hi lakshmi-pyaare ke sangeet nirdesan main film dosti ke liye gaae geet chaahunga mai tuje sanjh savere ke liye rafi ko teesraa filmphere puraskaar mila
 In 1965, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India

 1960 ke dashak main apane kariyar ke sheersh par pahunchane ke baad dashak kaa ant unke liye sukhad nahin rahaa
 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman= avarohan ==1960 ke dashak main apane kariyar ke sheersh par pahunchane ke baad dashak kaa ant unke liye sukhad nahin rahaa
 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman se gane record karwaane ko kaha
 At that time Rafi went for Hajj
 panchamada ko apane priy gayak kishor kumaar se gavaane kaa mauka mila or unhone rup tera mastaana tathaa mere sapanom kii rani gane kishor da kii aawaaj main record karavaaya
 Both these songs became very popular and actor Rajesh Khanna of this song became very popular among the directors and public

 After this the expiration of Rafi's singer life began
 hanlanki iske baad bhi unhone kai hit gane diye, jaise ye duniya ye mehfil, ye jo chilman he, tum jo mil gaye ho

 Mohammed Rafi is also known for his greatness
 wo bahut hansmukh or dariyadil the tathaa hameshaa sabaki madad ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 He sang many film songs without taking any money or with very little money
 apane shuruaati dinon main sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant-pyarelal ke liye unhone bahut kam paison main gaaya tha
 His dispute with Lata Mangeshkar over the royalty of the songs is also indicative of his generosity
 us samay lataji kaa kahana tha ki gane gane ke baad bhi un gaanon se hone vaali aamadani kaa ek ansh gayakon tathaa gayikaon ko milanaa chahie
 Rafi saheb was against this and said that once the songs have been recorded and the singer-singers have been paid their fees, they should not expect any more money
 is baat ko lekar dono mahaan kalakaaron ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 Lata refused to sing on the set with Rafi and for years no duet song came out
 baad main abhinetri naragis ke kehane par hi dono ne saath gaanaa chaalu kiya or jewel thief film main dil pukaare gaanaa gaaya
 He died due to cardiac arrest on 31 July 1980
 rafi ne apane jivan main kul kitne gane gaae is par kuch vivaad he
 In the 1970s, the Guinness Book of World Records wrote that Lata Mangeshkar was responsible for recording the most songs, recording a total of 25,000 songs
 rafi ne iskaa khandan karte hue gineez book ko ek chitthee likhi
 Subsequent editions featured the claims of the two singers simultaneously and credited Muhammad Rafi for recording 28,000 songs between 1944 and 1980
 iske baad hui khoj main vishwaas nerurkar ne paaya ki lata ne vastav main 1989 tak keval 5,044 gane gaae the
 Other researchers have also accepted this fact as true
 iske atirikt raju bharatan ne paaya ki 1948 or 1987 ke bich keval 35,000 hindi gane ricard hue
 It is difficult to believe that Rafi sang 28,000 songs, but some sources still cite this number
 is shodh ke baad 1992 main gineez book ne gayan kaa uparokt ricard book se nikaal diya

 Thinking that his given name might not be remembered by his fans in the future, he chose a stage name Cat Stevens, partly because a girlfriend said he had eyes like a cat, but that The main reason was that he said, "I don't think anyone would go to the record store and say that he wanted 'that Stevens Demetre Georgio album'

 The second is a special type of ball bowled by an off spin bowler in the game of cricket, which was made popular by Pakistani cricketer Saqlain Mushtaq
 is shabd kaa urdu main arth he "duusari vaali"
 sakalan mushtak ne doosraa ke ek nae sanskaran kii bhi khoj kii he jise ve "teesraa" kehete hai, jiskaa arth he "teesri vaali"
 Other bowlers have used the second lot in international cricket; These include Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajanta Mendis of Sri Lanka, Johan Botha of South Africa, Harbhajan Singh of India and Shoaib Malik and Saeed Ajmal of Pakistan
 doosraa ek apekshaakrit nae kism kii gendbaaji he
 Saqlain Mushtaq is credited with its discovery; This has played an important role in his success and the future of spin bowling, as it is unlikely that any of the off-spin bowlers would have used the ball from the leg side before him
 is gend ke namakaran kaa shrey pakistan ke purv wicketiper moin khan ko diya jaataa he, jo wicket ke peeche se mushtak ko "doosraa" daalane ke liye kehete the
 Tony Greig, who made a commentary in one of these matches, was eventually able to relate the term to the ball and this was also confirmed by Saqlain in a post-match interview
 is prakaar yah shabd cricket samskruti kaa ek hissaa ban gaya
 The second has now become an important part of spin bowling
 haalanki kuch logon ke anusaar doosraa kii vaastavik shuruyaat 1950 ke dashak main west indies kii taraf se khilne vaale sauni ramadin dwaara kii gayi thi, kyonki ek of-brake gendbaaj kii tarah gend ko pakadaney ke baavjood ve gend ko donon taraf ghumaate the or doosraa daalane vaale kai of-brake gendbaajon kii hi tarah unka bhi gendbaaji ection sandigdh tha
 The bowler bowls the ball in the same manner as the fingers of a normal off break, but rotates his wrist slightly so that the back of the hand remains in front of the batsman
 aisa karne par gend ek saamaanya of brake kii ulti disha main ghoomane lagati he or ek daaen haath ke ballebaaj ke liye leg said se of said kii taraf spin karti he
 Second, for an off-spinner is the ball equivalent of a leg-spinner's googly; The googly rotates in the opposite direction of the normal ball of a leg spinner
 ek baayen haath kaa gendbaaj bhi doosraa gend daal saktaa he, jo ki of se leg kii taraf ghumegi
 srilanka ke baayein haath ke gendbaaj rangan herath ko isi prakaar kii gend daalane ke kaaran pahchaan mili thi, visheshkar ek e tour ke dauraan australia ke khilaaf
 england ke baayen haath ke gendbaaj monti panesar kaa daawa he ki vah gharelu maichon main kabhi-kabhi is prakaar kii gend daalate rahe hai
 It seems that many other off-spinners are trying to use "second" more and more
 dilachasp baat yah he ki swayan sakalan mushtak ke atirikt, is gend kaa istemaal karne vaale anya sabhi of-spinneron ke khilaaf phenkane kaa aarope lagaaya ja chukaa he, haalanki adhikansh maamalon main ise kaarij kar diya gaya he
 These include Muttiah Muralitharan, Harbhajan Singh, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Malik and Johan Botha
 varavikshire ke purv gendbaaj elex ludan dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale ek anya tareeke main, bich kii oongali ko gend ke peeche rakhke gend daalate samay use 'flik' kiya jaataa he, aisa karne par gend leg se of kii taraf gumti he
 It is not possible to say anything about the success of the second one as Loudon made his ODI debut for England on 24 June 2006 against Sri Lanka
 unhone koi wicket to nahin liya lekin match main doosraa gend avashya daali thi
 There was also no charge of throwing against him
 dakshin australia ke dan kalen bhi kathith rup se doosraa gend daal lete hai
 Ajanta Mendis was successful early in his career using the middle finger flick style of Doosra
 muralidharan kaa doosraa, 2004 main australia ke srilanka daure ke dauraan gendbaaji karte samay, kohni ke upar baanh ko avaidh tareeke se sidhaa karne ke liye match referi kris broad dwaara aadhikarik report kaa vishay bani thi
 Later biomechanical tests conducted at the University of Western Australia, Perth, found that Muralitharan straightened his arm by 10 degrees when placing the second, which was much higher than the 5 degrees allowed by the International Cricket Council for spin bowlers
 muralidharan ko baad main srilanka cricket dwaara nirdesh diya gaya ki ve antarrashtriya cricket main doosraa kaa prayog na karen
 In November 2004, the International Cricket Council conducted further research in the area of illegal bowling action and found that many bowlers whose actions were considered legitimate were actually violating the rules
 2005 kii shuruyaat main isisi ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikariyon kii baithak main ek niyam badlaav ko prastaavit or sweekrut kar liya gaya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki koi bhi gendbaaj apni baanh ko 15 degree tak sidhaa kar saktaa he or is prakaar muralidharan kii doosraa punah ek vaid gend ban gayi
 In February 2006, in an attempt to silence Australian audiences and their 'no Ball' slogans, Muralitharan underwent another test at the University of Western Australia in which all his balls, including another, were found valid
 bhartiya gendbaaj harbhajan singh kii doosraa gend, disambar 2004 main chittagong main bharat or bangladesh ke bich khele gaye duusare test ke baad match referi kris broad, on-field ampiron aleem daar or mark benson, tathaa tivi ampire mahaboobur rahamaan kii ek aadhikarik report dwaara vishay bani thi
 It was reported that his arm is straight to an angle of 10 degrees while ICC standards accept up to 5 degrees
 pakistani olerounder shoeb malik ke khilaaf bhi 2004 disambar main pakistan or australia ke bich khele gaye pehle test ke baad unke doosraa ko lekar shikaayat kii gayi thi
 Like Muralitharan, he was also subjected to biomechanical tests and did not bowl in the remaining Tests of that series
 apni doosraa gend daalate samay thro karne ke aropit anya cricketron ke vipareet, malik ek sakasham ballebaaj bhi hai or kuch vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki is gend ko daalane se roke jane par ve apni ballebaaji par adhik dhyaan dene lagenge
 malik ko 2004 main australia ke khilaaf pehle test ke liye pakistani team se hataa diya gaya tha, haalanki aisa kisi vivaad ke chalate nahin balki perth kii pich ke spin gendbaajon ke pratikul hone kii vajah se kiya gaya tha
 Malik resumed bowling in May 2005 after making some corrections
 england ke khilaaf november 2005 main multan main pehle test ke baad unke or ahamed shabbir ke khilaaf phir se shikaayat kar di gayi
 In May 2006, Malik underwent elbow surgery to correct his bowling action
 Malik and the Pakistan Cricket Board had earlier unsuccessfully argued that his bowling action looked suspicious due to an injury to his elbow in a 2003 road accident
 malik june 2006 main punah khel ke maidan par utre lekin ab ve doosraa gend kaa istemaal nahin karte hai
 After the third Test match against Australia in 2006, a complaint was filed against Johan Botha of South Africa for their version of the second
 botha kaa vah pehla test match tha jisamen unhone 2 wicket liye
 His bowling was later ruled illegal and banned, although the ban was scrapped in November 2006
 haalanki, april 2009 main australia kii shrinkhalaa ke baad unke gendbaaji ection ke punarmoolyankan ke liye unhen phir se bulaayaa gaya
 In May 2009, he was allowed to bowl all types of balls other than the second as his second was considered to be beyond the 15 degree limit
 july 2009 main cricket australia ke centre for excilence main yojit spin shikhar sammelan main nirnay liya gaya ki yuva spinneron ko doosraa gend sikhaai nahin jaayegi
 baithak main nimna pratinidhi shaamil the, purv test spinner shen warn, stuart macgil, gym higgs, govin robertson, terry jiner, peter philpot tathaa ashley mallett
 unke anusaar, doosraa ko vaid tareeke se nahin daalaa ja saktaa he or jab tak isisi chaking ke sabhi roopon vaid banane kaa faisla nahin karata he tab tak ise australia main nahin sikhaaya jayega
 In an interview, Vincent Barnes argues that UWA professor and ICC biomechanist, Bruce Elliott, made an interesting discovery in his research with finger spinners
 unhone kaha ki "unhone paaya he ki upmahadweep ke kai gendbaaj doosraa ko vaid rup se daal sakate hai lekin kokeshian gendbaaj nahin
" In 2004, Saqlain Mushtaq, who developed the second, claimed to have developed a new version called the third, which is a top-spinner ball as an off-spinner
 unke dwaara kathith taur par isiel maichon main iskaa istemaal kiya gaya tha

 hathi duniya kii sabase budhimaan prajatiyon main se ek hai
 An elephant's brain weighing more than 5 kilograms is larger than that of any terrestrial animal
 haalanki sabase bade aakaar kii whale ke sharir kaa vazan ek praroopik hathi kii tulana main 20 guna adhik hota he, whale ke mastishk kaa vazan ek hathi ke mastishk kii tulana main doguna hota he
 The elephant's brain is similar to the human brain by structure and complexity - just as an elephant's vulcanus contains as many neurons as the human brain, which indicates convergent development
 hathi kai prakaar ke vyavhaar pradarshit karte hai, inamen dukh, siikhnaa, maatrutiv, anukaran, kala, khel, hasya, paropkaarita, upkarnon kaa upyog, karunaa or sahyog ityadi bhavanaaen shaamil hai
 These behaviors may also include self awareness, memory, and possibly language
 inamen atyadhik budhimaan prajatiyon ke ve sabhi gun paae jate hai jinhen ketasian or primets ke samatuly mana jaataa he
 Because of elephants' high intelligence and strong family ties, some researchers argue that it is morally wrong for humans to choose them
 arestu ne ek baar kaha tha ki hathi "ve jaanavar hai jo man or buddhi kii drushti se sabhi anya jaanwaron ko peeche chhod dete hai"
 Elephants have a very large and highly volatile neocortex, the same feature found in specific species of humans, apes and dolphins
 vaigyanik ise jatil budhimatta kaa sanket maanate hai
 This is a well-known fact, with at least one exception: Echidna's brain is highly developed, yet is not considered intelligent
 The cerebral cortex of the Asian elephant has the highest volume, one of the most extant terrestrial animals
 Is a cognitive feature
 haathiyon ke cerebral cortex kaa aaytan sangyanatmak prasanskaran ke liye uplabdh hota he jo kisi bhi anya primet prajati kii tulana main adhik hota he or vyapak adhyayan haathiyon ko upkarnon ke upyog or upkarnon ke nirmaan ke liye sangyanatmak kshamta ke shabdon main mahaan vaanron kii shrenee main rakhte hai
 The elephant's brain represents a more complex gyral pattern and has more and numerous folds than humans, primates, or carnivorous animals, but is less complex than the Catechians
 haalanki, hathi ke mastishk kii valkut "ketasian kii tulana main adhik moti hoti he" or mana jaataa he ki isamen utane hi valkutiy neuron or valkutiy synapse hote hai jitne ki manushya main, jo ketasian kii tulana main adhik hote hai
 : 71 The elephant is thought to be equivalent to the dolphin in terms of its ability to solve a problem, and many scientists place the elephant's intelligence on the same level as the Katyasian; In fact, according to a 2011 article published by ABC Science, "elephants are as smart as chimp dolphins"
 hathi main bhi atyadhik badi or atyadhik sanvalni hippocampus, mastishk saranchana limbik pranali main pai jaati he jo kisi bhi manushya, primet yaa ketasian se badi hoti he
 The hippocampus of an elephant makes up about 0
7% of the central structure of the brain, compared to 0
5% in humans and 0
1% in risso dolphin and 0
05% in bottlenose dolphin
 hippocampus bhaawanaaon se sambandhit he, yah vishesh rup se smriti main yogadan detaa he
 It is believed that due to this reason elephants also become victims of mental shock and its symptoms are equivalent to post-traumatic stress disorder

 The overall EQ average is 1
88, which is an average of 2
14 for Asian elephants, and 1
67 for African elephants ": 151
 It is a matter of debate that EQ, or brain size, is relative to body size, it is wise
 There is an accurate scale for, especially the animals with the highest EQ are treasured yet they are not considered highly intelligent or intelligent
 manushyon kii tarah hathi bade hote hote vyavhaar sikhte hai
 When they are born, they do not know how to survive in the world
 haathiyon ke paas jivan main seekhney ke liye bahut adhik samay hota he, yah avadhi lagbhag 10 saal ke aasapaas hoti he
 a comparative method of measuring intelligence is to compare brain size at birth with the size of a fully grown adult's brain
 yah ingit karata he ki ek prajati kam umr main kitna kuch seekhney kii kshamta rakhti he
 Brain weight at birth is around 90 percent of adult brain weight in most mammals
 manushya ke janm ke samay uske mastishk kaa vajan vyask ke mastishk kaa 28 pratishat hota he, bottlenos dolphin main yah 42
5%, chimpanji main 54%, or haathiyon main 35 pratishat hota he
 This indicates that elephants learn the most after humans and this behavior is not just instinct, but this learning process goes on throughout life
 yah dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki vritti sikhi gayi budhimatta se kaaphi alag he
 Parents teach their children how to eat, how to use equipment, they explain their place in a highly complex elephant society
 pramastishk kii temporal paaliyaan, jo smriti ke sangrah kaa kaam karti hai, manushyon kii tulana main kaaphi badi hoti hai
 Spindle cells play an important role in the development of intelligence behavior
 prarambh main, yah sochaa gaya ki spindal neuronon kii upasthiti manushyon or mahaan vaanron ke liye adwitiya thi
 However, studies have shown that spindle neurones are also found in the brains of both Asian and African elephants: 242 as well as humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales, sperm whales, bottlenose dolphins, risso dolphins and beluga whales
 Are also found in hathi ke mastishk or manushya ke mastishk ke bich samanta sansruth vikaas kii thisis kaa samarthan karti he
 : 154 hathi aise jivit prajatiyon ke samaajon main se ek hai jo ek duusare se kaaphi nikatataa se sambandhit hote hai
 Elephant family members are separated from each other only due to death, or they can be separated only by taking their members hostage
 haathiyon main visheshgyata rakhane vaale sinthia mos ne africa haathiyon ke ek parivaar kaa adhyayan kiya
 Two family members were shot by hunters, later chased by the remaining elephants
 haalanki ek hathi kii mrityu ho gayi, doosraa tina naam kii ek hathini, khadi rahi, lekin uske ghutane jawaab de rahe the
 Two members of the family, Trista and Teresia, both of Tina, stand up and help her stand up
 ant main, tina itnaa kamjor pad gayi ki vah jameen par gir gayi or mar gayi
 However, Trista and Teresia did not give up, they kept trying to raise him
 unhone kisi tarah se tina ko baithaaya, lekin uskaa sharir bejaan tha, vah phir se jameen par gir gayi
 Then the other family members also came for help, they tried to put grass in Tina's mouth
 iske baad terresia ne apane daant ko tina ke sir agle hisse ke neeche rakhaa or use uthaane kii koshish kii
 As he did so, his right tooth broke completely, coming out of the lips and nerve cavity
 haathiyon ne use uthaane kii koshish band kar di lekin ve use chhod kar nahin gaye, iske bajaay, unhone use ek chhichley gadde main dafnaanaa shuru kar diya, uske sharir ke upar pattiyaan daaleen
 They stood there all night and started leaving there in the morning
 sabase ant main terresia gayi
 Elephants are closely related to each other, have feelings of mother-son love, their family is devastated by the death of one member, and some groups may never be able to recreate their group
 Cynthia Mose observed a mother's child after her death, walking slowly behind her family's herd for several days
 edward topsel ne 1658 main apni pustak da history of for-footed bists main kaha, "duniya bhar ke jaanwaron main hathi ke alaava aisa koi praani nahin he jo itani paryaapt kshamta or shakti kaa pradarshan kar sake or or usamen itani buddhi bhi ho
 In this publication, he said that elephants worship the sun and the moon and conceive by chewing a special kind of poisonous plant, both of which are not true
 haathiyon kii sahyog kushalta ke sandarbh main unki tulana chimpanji ke saath kii jaati he
 Elephants are considered highly altruistic animals, they even help other species including humans in times of crisis
 bharat main, ek hathi lakdi uthaane vaale logon kii madad kar rahaa tha, vah ek trek ke peeche chal rahaa tha or apane mahavat ke aadesh par pehle se bane hue chhedon main lakdi ko rakh rahaa tha
 In a certain hole, the elephant refused to keep the wood
 mahavat dekhne aayaa or usne dekha ki ek kutta us chhed main so rahaa he
 The elephant landed the wood in the hole only when the dog was gone
 sinthia mos ne aksar paaya he ki hathi aksar yah soch kar apana rasta badal lete hai ki manushyon ko koi nuksaan na pahunche, ve yahaan tak ki aisa karte hai jab unhen khud aisa karne main kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa padataa he 
 Joyce Pool details an incident by Colin Francombe at Cookie Galmen's Laikipia Ranch
 ek gadhriya apane uunton ke saath ja rahaa tha jab uskaa saamana haathiyon ke ek parivaar se hua
 Metriarch attacked him, breaking one of his legs
 shaam ko, jab vah waapas nahin lautaa, use dhundne ke liye trek main kuch logon ko bheja gaya
 When he met an elephant was protecting him
 jaanavar ne trek par hamalaa kiya, isliye unhone us par goli chalaa kar use daraane kii koshish kii
 Later, the shepherd told him that when he could not stand, the elephant picked him up with his trunk and made him sit in the shade of a tree
 usne puure din uski raksha kii or halake se apni sound se use chooti rahi
 Elephants in Africa treat themselves by chewing the leaves of a tree of the Borginaceae family, which induces labor pains
 kenya ke hathi bhi isi prayojan ke liye is ped kaa upyog karte the
 Apart from Homo sapien sapien and Neanderthal, elephant is the only species on earth that performs special rituals at the time of death
 ve apane priyajan kii asthiyon main bahut ruchi lete hai 
 aksar dekha jaataa he ki ve bade aaraam se apni sound or pairon se asthiyaan nikaal rahen hai or baaki hathi shanti se baithe hai
 Sometimes such elephants also come to the tomb of the deceased, who have no relation with him
 jab kisi hathi ko chot lagati he, anya hathi uski madad karte hai
 Elephant researcher Martin Meredith wrote about the ritual of the death of an elephant in his book, Anthony Michael Hall, a South African zoologist who studied elephants for more than eight years in Addo, South Africa
 mritak kaa puraa parivaar, uske chote bachche sahit, uske sharir ko sound se sahala rahaa tha, use uthaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 The herd of elephants was making loud noises
 uskaa baccha ro rahaa tha or uski dukh bhari chikhen suni ja sakati thim, lekin tabhi puraa samooh achaanak shant ho gaya
 Then they started putting soil and leaves on his body, broke the branches of the tree to cover it
 They spend the next two days silently standing on his body, sometimes they go in search of food and water but always return
 manushya ke aas paas haathiyon kaa is prakaar kaa vyavhaar puure africa main aam he
 On many occasions, he has also buried dead humans or helped them in grief
 meredith ek or ghatana kaa yaad karte hai jo unhen ek kenyayi game warden jorge adamson ne bataai thi, ek boodhi turk mahila apane ghar kaa rasta bhul gayi, vah ek ped ke neeche so rahi thi
 When she awakened, an elephant stood over her and was fondling her
 vah sthir ho gayi, kyonki vah bahut dar gayi thi
 Another elephant came there, they started screaming loudly and buried it under the branches
 agali subah sthaneey charavaahon ne use vaahna paaya, use koi chot nahin pahunchi thi
 George Adamson recalls another incident when he hunted a bull elephant in a group that had sneaked into a government garden in northern Kenya
 jorge ne sthaneey turk adivaasiyon ko hathi kaa maance diya or shesh shav ko ek mile tak ghaseet kar le gaya
 That night, the other elephants found her body, took her shoulder blade and leg bone, went to the exact spot where the elephant was killed
 vaigyanik aksar is baat par bahes karte hai ki hathi bhaawanaaon ko mahasoos karte hai
 Joyce Pool has seen wild African Ha thi playing several times 
 ve aksar apane or dusron ke manoranjan ke liye kai kaam karte hai
 It is often seen that elephants pull water into their trunk, then wave their trunk in the air and spray the water like a fountain
 haal ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki hathi jis aawaaj ko sunate hai, uski nakal kar sakate hai
 This was found when an orphaned elephant mimicked the sound of trucks passing by
 ab tak jin jaanwaron ko awaajon kii nakal ke liye janaa jaataa he, unamem whale, dolphin, chamagadad, primet or pakshi shaamil hai
 The 23-year-old African elephant Calimero exhibited a special type of imitation
 vah swiss chidyaghar main asian haathiyon ke saath tha
 Asian elephants make the sound of a chirp which is different from the deep rumble sound of African elephants
 kelimero ne bhi chirp karnaa shuru kar diya, vah apni prajati kii praroopik gahari aawaaj nahin karata tha
 Kosik, an Indian elephant at Everland Amusement Park in South Korea, surprised the trainers when he mimicked the sound of his trainer Jong Gap Kim
 kosik aath korian shabdon kii nakal kar saktaa he jisamen sit, no, yes or laai down shaamil hai
 His copy sounds exactly like a human voice
 kosik apni sound ko apane munh main rakhata he, phir ise saans chhodte hue hilaataa he or manushya kii aawaaj nikaalata he
 It does something like this when people put a finger in their mouth and whistle
 hathi ek duusare ke sampark main rahane ke liye awaajen nikaalte hai, jab ve ek duusare ko dekh nahin pate hai
 Female elephants can also remember these voices, thus differentiating their family members from outside members
 ve is aadhaar par bhi paariwarik ikaayiyon ke bich vibhedan kar lete hai ki ye awaajen kitni baar sunai deen
 Elephants have a remarkable ability to use instruments, they use their trunk like an arm
 hathi pani pine ke liye khadde khod dete hai, ek ped kii chaal ko udhed lete hai, use chaba kar gend kii akruti de dete hai, ek chhed ko bhar dete hai, vashpikaran ko rokane ke liye ise mitti se dhak dete hai, baad main waapas yahaan aakar pani pite hai
 They often use twigs to fly or to itch themselves
 hathi bijli kii baad par bahut badi chattan ko girte hai, yaaki yah nasht ho jaye yaa bijli cat jaye
 Like many other species, elephants also perform artistry by holding the brush with their trunk
 iskaa ek udhaaharan ek tivi program extraordinary animals main dikhaaya gaya he, jisamen hathi thailand ke ek camp main phulon kii ek painting bana rahaa tha
 Although the paintings were made by elephants, a person was always helping and guiding them
 in prastutiyon se, nishchit rup se yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki hathi apni chitrakala kii akruti ke bare main sachet hai yaa nahin
 An extraordinary video documentary of an elephant in which the elephant is photographing an elephant — presumably showing self-awareness — has become very popular on Internet news and video websites
 painting kii gunvattta bahut unchi he, ise dekh kar kai darshakon ne video kii satyata ke bare main andeh vyakt kiya
 The website snopes
com, which specializes in urban legends, describes the video as "true", with the elephant making a stroke with a brush, but note that the similarity of the finished painting reflects the strokes learned rather than the elephant's creative effort is
 hathi lambaa samay samasya ko sulajhane main bitaa sakate hai
 They change their behavior accordingly to meet new challenges, a sign of complex intelligence
 2010 main kiye gaye ke prayog main paaya gaya ki bhojan paane ke liye, "hathi aise partner kii madad karnaa sikh jate hai jisamen do jeev inaam paane ke liye ek hi rassi ke do siron ko khinch rahen hai", ve apni sahyog kushalta ke str ke sandarbh main chimpanziyon ke samatuly hai
 In the 1970s, there was an Asian elephant named Bandula in Marine World Africa, USA
 bandula ne uske pairon main baandhi gayi bediyon ko khol diya, yaa unhen tod daalaa
 The most complicated device was the brumel hook, this device stops when two opposite points move simultaneously
 bandula ne hook ko tab tak khiskaaya jab tak ye donon bindu ek duusare se dur nahin ho gaye
 When she freed herself she started helping them free other elephants as well
 bandula ke maamle main or nishchit rup se anya bandhak banaaye gaye jaanavar ke maamle main hathi dhokhaa dene kaa prayaas bhi karata he, jaise vah aas paas dekh kar yah sunishchit kar letaa he ki koi use dekh to nahin rahaa
 In another case, a female elephant opened an inch thick iron rod with the help of an eye hole
 usne iske liye apni sound kaa upyog kiya or bolt ko khol liya
 Ruby, an Asian elephant in the Phoenix Zoo, would often hide and listen to her keeper when he talked about her
 jab usne shabd paint suna tab vah bahut uttejit ho gayi
 He loved the colors green, yellow, blue and red
 ek khaas din vahaan ek trek aayaa, use use paas hi park kiya gaya, vahaan ek aadmi ko dil kaa daura padaa tha
 The light of the truck was flashing in yellow, red and white colors
 jab baad main rubi ne usee din paint kiya, usne inhen rangon ko chunaa
 She also preferred colors that her keepers wore
 ek hathi prashikshak, harry piche ne cocao namak hathi ke saath ek sahyogi sambandh viksit kiya
 Coco used to help her instructor, her keepers encouraged her by giving many commands and Coco learned many words
 piche ne kaha ki hathi aksar manushya ke kaam main sahyog karne lagate hai, agar unke prati sammaan or samvedansheeltaa kii bhaavana rakhi jaye
 cocao us samay kaam karti thi jab use rakhwale ko "hathi kii madad" kii zarurat hoti thi
 Once they were transferring a group of female elephants to another zoo
 jab rakhwale ek maadaa ko sthanantarit karnaa chaahate the, ve aamtaur par uske naam ke baad shabd transfar kaa upyog karte the 
 cocao jald hi iskaa arth samaj gayi
 If the keepers talked about transferring the elephant, they would stop moving, then they would say, "give me the cocoa
" Coco used to help by hearing this
 haathiyon ke saath 27 saal tak kaam karne ke baad piche kaa yah drudh vishwaas he ki ve shabdon or kuch shabdon kii vaakya rachana ko samaj sakate hai
 This is a very rare symptom in the animal class
 tokyo vishvavidhyalay ke dow naoko iri ne ek adhyayan main paaya ki hathi ankaganit main bhi kaushal kaa pradarshan karte hai
 In the experiment "different numbers of apples were put in two baskets in front of the elephants of the zoo and it was recorded how many times the elephant picked up the basket with more fruits
" When more than one apple was added to the basket, it meant that "the elephant had to keep the total of this count in his mind"
 The results show that "74 percent of the time the animal picked up the perfect basket
 The African elephant scored the highest score of 87 percent
 Humans were able to show only a 67 percent success rate in the same competition
" It was also filmed to prove accuracy
 asian hathi jaanwaron ke ek chote samooh main shaamil ho gaye hai, inamen mahaan vanar, bottlenos dolphin, magapi, shaamil hai jo aatm-jaagrukta pradarshit karte hai
 The study was conducted at the Bronx Zoo in New York with the Wildlife Conservation Society using elephants
 haalanki kai jaanavar darpan ke liye pratikriya dete hai, bahut kam is pramaan ko darshaate hai ki ve pahachaanate hai ki darpan main ve apane aap ko dekh rahen hai
 The study found that Asian elephants also exhibit similar behavior when they stand in front of a mirror of 2
5 m-by-2
5 m - they stand in front of a mirror and eat their food to eat
 Let's get closer
 hathi kii aatm jaagrukta kaa pramaan tab mila jab hathi happy ne baar baar apane sir par paint kiye gaye x ko apni sound se sparsh kiya, is nishaan ko keval darpan main hi dekha ja saktaa tha
 Happy ignored another mark made of colorless paint, this mark was also made on her forehead to ensure that she was not reacting to the smell of the paint
 adhyayan kaa sanchaalan karne vaale frans di waal ne kaha, "manushya or hathi ke bich ye samanthaayen suzav detii hai ki ek sansruth sangyanatmak vikaas sambhawatah jatil samaaj or sahyog se sambandhit he

 Some scientists and environmentalists say that killing them is "unnecessary and inhumane"
 Since elephants resemble humans in many ways, their brains are like humans, they have social bonds, these traits reflect empathy, feeling, intelligence

 vanaspatik janan ek prakaar kaa alangik janan he jo vanaspatiyon main hota he
 In this reproduction process new vegetation is produced without seeds or spores
 vanaspatik janan prakritik rup se bhi hota he or udyanvaigyanikon dwaara prerit bhi ho saktaa he
 In botanical reproduction, a botanical part originates a new tree and starts a new life, separated from the parent plant
 iske do prakaar, ek prakritik or doosraa kritrim, hai
 Natural botanical reproduction is of the following types: samudbhavan koshika main ek taraf yaa chaaron taraf anek pravaradh nikalakar matra koshika se alag hokar swatantra rup se pravardhan kar koshikaon kii shrunkhlaa banaate hai
 An example is yeast
 ek duusare prakaar ke samudbhavan ko jima samudbhavan kehete hai, jisamen paitruk pind ke kisi nikle bhaag se kaliyaan nikalakar usee ke saath lipati rahati hai, yaa alag ho jaati hai
 This is seen in genus moss, liververt and coral dendrophilia
 bhustari yaa ranor main jo paudhe sidhe khadey nahin ho sakate ve jameen par rengte hue badhate hai, unke upar ke bhaag par valkal patr rahete hai, jinke konon main kaliyaan rahati hai
 Thin thin roots between buds leave the ground and thus new plants are prepared
 doob ghaas iskaa udhaaharan he
 Sucker resembles landfall
 antar yah he ki sakar main jameen ke andar tanon par valkal patr hote hai or unke konon kii kaliyon se shakhaayen nikalakar hawa main chali jaati hai
 Shattered roots emerge from the floor of each branch and enter the ground
 pudinaa iskaa udhaaharan he
 The terrestrial or offset also spreads like terrestrial, but it is shorter and thicker than the terrestrial and creeps a short distance and produces a new plant at the end of the stem
 patrakand yaa balbil main akshakoniya kaliyaan hoti hai, jo adhik maatra main khaadya padaarth ekatrit ho jane se moti ho jaati hai or jameen par girane par nae paudhe ko janm detii hai
 Garlic, inflorescence, banalu or zaminkand, pineapple etc
 are examples of this
 prakand yaa risom ke upar valkal patr or neeche jhakadaa jaden hoti hai
 Sprouts come out from the buds of the angles of the letter and go into the air
 jaden pramukh risom se alag hokar vanshavistaar karti hai
 Examples are ginger, turmeric and ferns
 ghanakand yaa karm ke udhaaharan ghuiyaan or banda hai
 Below these lies a bloated stem called mandal
 iske upar valkalapatr kaa aavaran hota he
 They have buds in the angle, from which the seedlings go up on favorable weather and the roots come out from the bottom and go inside the earth
 is prakar nae paudhe utpann hote rahete hai
 The bulb is very dense, but its mandible is smaller and there are thick thick slices at the top
 andar kii pattee ke kone main kali rahati he, jo anukool mausam par nae tane ko janm detii he
 Onions are an example of this
 kand yaa tuber valkalapatron ke konon main kand lagata he
 The stem of the tuber remains bloated
 isamen khaadya sanchit rahata he
 Potato is a good example of this
 aalu par kaliyaan yaa aankhe hoti hai
 Each eye produces a plant
 jadon dwaara vanaspatik utpaadan main satawar, dalia or shakarkand kii jaden kand utpann karti hai, in kandon se phir nae paudhe utpann hote hai
 Leaves of some plants produce new plants in production by the leaves
 inhen patrakalika kehete hai
 Examples of this are Kuchi, Begonia, Parvanta, and Calancoi
 kuch fern main bhi isi reeti se janan hota he
 Some plants also breed artificially
 kuch paudhe tanon kii kataran se, kuch paudhe kalam baandhane se or kuch daab kalam se nae paudhon ko utpann karte hai
 The genetic purity of the plant can be maintained by artificial botanical reproduction, which is not fixed by the plant produced by the seed, and the reproduction is often certain
 aise janan ke liye khaadya padaarth paryaapt rahanaa chahie
 In its absence, the reproduction may be sexual or asexual
 vichaaron kaa itihaas, itihaas main anusandhan kaa ek kshetra he jo samay ke saath maanav ke vichaaron main parivartan, vichaaron kii abhivyakti evam unki sangrakshan aadi kaa adhyayan karata he
 Thus it can be called a subdivision of intellectual history
 vichaaron kaa itihaas ke samyak adhyayan main darshan kaa itihaas, vigyaan kaa itihaas or sahitya kaa itihaas bahut upyogi hai
 It has been taught as a subject in universities since the 1930s in Sweden

 In the early twentieth century, a historian named Arthur o Lovejoy first uprooted the phrase "history of ideas" and began to study the subject methodically
 livejoy kaa mat he ki sabhi vichaar ek yaa adhik sookshm vichaaron ke yoga se banate hai
 These subtle ideas were called "thought units"
 unka mat he ki samay ke saath vichaar-ekak aparivartit rahete hai; hota yah he ki ve samay ke saath alag reeti se milte hai or ek naye yug main, nayi abhivyakti ke rup main, naye vichaaron ko janm dete hai
 The job of the "historian of ideas" is to identify these ideas and present an analysis and description of their historical rise

 Template: Censorship ek preyokti kaa arth hota he, sunanevaale ko rusht karne vaali yaa koi apriy arth dene vaali abhivyakti ko ek ruchikar yaa kam apmanjanak abhivyakti ke saath pratisthapit karnaa, yaa kehane vaale ke liye use kam kshtakar bananaa, jaisaa kii dwiarthi ke maamle main hota he
 Deployment of euphemisms is a central aspect in the public use of political correctness
 yah kisi vastu yaa kisi vyakti ke varnan ko bhi pratisthapit kar saktaa he taaki gopneey, pavitra, yaa dharmik naamon ko ayogy ke samaksh zaahir karne se bachaa ja sake, yaa kisi vaarta ke vishay kii pahchaan ko kisi sambhavit prachhnn shrota se gupt rakhaa ja sake
 kuch preyoktiyaan iradatan manoranjan ke liye hoti hai
 When a phrase is used as a euphemism, it often becomes a metaphor that literally loses its meaning
 preyoktiyon kaa istemaal apriy yaa pareshaan karne vaale vichaaron ko chhipaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, tab bhi jab unka shabdic pad nishchit rup se aakraamak naa ho
 is prakaar kii preyokti ko jan-sampark or raajnneeti main istemaal kiya jaataa he, jahaan ise kabhi-kabhi dwiarthi kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes, the use of euphemisms is considered equivalent to chivalry
 andhvishwasi preyoktiyaan bhi hoti hai, jo is avadharana par aadhaarit hai ki shabdon main badakismati laane kii takat hoti he or kuch dharmik preyoktiyaan bhi hoti hai, jo is avadharana par aadhaarit hoti hai ki kuch shabd pavitra hote hai, yaa kuch shabd aadhyatmik rup se lupt praaia hone ko hai 
 The English word euphemism derives from the Greek word euphemo, meaning "good / good / lucky speech / type" which in turn is derived from the Greek root words eu, "good / good" + pheme "speech / speak"
 yuphem vastav main ek shabd yaa vaakyansh tha jise un dharmik shabdon yaa vaakyashon ke sthaan par istemaal kiya jaataa he jinhen jor se nahin kaha janaa chahie tha; vyutpattishastra ke anusaar, yuphem shabd, blosphem kaa vipareet he
 The primary examples of prohibition words that require the use of a euphemism are unspeakable names of gods such as Persiphone, Hecate, or Nemesis
 The English word euphemism was used by the ancient Greeks as a euphemism for themselves, meaning 'to hold a holy silence'
 aitihaasik bhashaa-vigyaan ne kai bhashaaon main nishedh virupanon ke sanketon ko prakat kiya he
 According to the information, many of these were present in European languages, including bear, wolf and deer
 In various indo-european languages, each of these words has a difficult etymology because of prohibitive distortions - substituting an euphemism for the original, which is no longer in the language
 ek udhaaharan he - beer ke liye slavik dhaatu - *medu-ed - jiskaa arth he "shahad khaanevaala"
 germanik bhashaaon main naam - angrezi sahit - rang bhure se praapt kiya gaya he
 Another example in English is "donkey", which replaced the old indo-european derived word "ace"
 pisenlit, arthath "bistar geela karnaa" kaa vikalp hote hue "dandlaian" shabd ek anya udhaaharan he, jo sambhavit rup se is tathy ko sanderbhit karata he ki singhparni kaa prayog mutrvardhak ke rup main hota hoga
 In the Pacific languages, the use of the name of the deceased head is forbidden
 swadeshi australian logon ke bich, mritak ke naam, chhavi, yaa drishy-shravy recording kaa upyog karnaa manaa he or isliye australian prasaaran nigam jab kisi mritak ke naam, chitra yaa shravy-drishy recording kaa upyog karata he to vah swadeshi australian logon ke liye chetavanee prakashit karata he
 Since people are often named after everyday things, this prompted the rapid development of euphemisms
 in bhashaaon main shabdaawalee parivartan kaa ek ucch dar he
 Similarly, in imperialist China, writers of Chinese classical texts were expected not to use the characters contained in the name of the current ruling emperor as a sign of respect
 In these examples, relevant characters were replaced by synonyms
 avaidh dawaaon ke aam naam or unhen praapt karne ke liye prayukt paudhe, aksar virupan nishedh jaisi hi samaan prakriya se guzarate hai, kyonki nae padon ko dusron kii upasthiti main chupake se unki charchaa karne ke kram main izaad kiya jaataa he
 This process often occurs in English for speed or crank)
 It occurs even more in Spanish, such as the distortion of the name for cannabis: rough, which replaces griffa, which replaces marihuana, which replaces cañamo
 All four of these names are still used in various parts of the Hispanophone world today, although cañamo sarcastically has the least meaning of the underworld and is often used to describe industrial hemp or legitimate medical cannabis
 preyoktiyaan aksar samay ke saath-saath khud hi nishedh shabd main viksit ho jaati hai, ek aisi prakriya ke madhyam se jise dablue

o
 queen dwaara varnan kiya gaya he, or adhik haal main steven pinkar dwaara "preyokti treadmill" qaraar diya gaya he
 Treadmill and dysfemism treadmill
 He did not use these now established words, but noted and commented on related processes in 1933
 ve shabd jinka mul aashay preyokti se tha ve apane preyokti mulya ko kho sakate hai or apane nirdeshy ke nakaaratmak taatpary ko grahan kar sakate hai
 In some cases, they can be used as satire and they become dysfemism
 udhaaharan ke liye, "kansantreshan camp" shabd, jiskaa istemaal boer samudaay ke asainya sadasyon ko sate-sate quarter main rakhe jane ko varnit karne ke liye hota tha, uskaa prayog dwitiya boer yuddh ke dauraan british dwaara kiya jaataa tha, mukhyatah isliye kyonki yah niraapad or gaiyr-apmanjanak lagata tha
 Despite the high mortality rate in British concentration camps, the term remained acceptable as euphemisms
 However, when Nazi Germany used this expression to describe their death camps in the 1930s and 1940s, the term gained a wide negative connotation, particularly in relation to the Holocaust
 iske alaava, angrezi ke kuch sanskarnon main, "lavetary " yaa "toilet" kii preyokti ko ab anupyukt mana jaataa he or ise "bathroom" or "water klojet" se pratisthapit kiya gaya he, jise phir "restaroom " or W
C
 se se pratisthapit kiya gaya
 These are also examples of euphemisms that are geographically focused
 "restaroom" shabd kaa shaayad hi kabhi sanyukt rajya ke baahar kiya jaataa he
 In the case of "WC", where it was previously quite popular in Britain, it is now becoming out of choice there, but has become more popular as a favorite polite word in France, Germany and Hungary
 isi tarah, vaigyanik yaa chikitsa shabd jo apni mul bhashaaon main vastav main preyokti hai, jaise "ainas", "vegina", yaa "pudendam" inhen ab thodaa asweekaarya mana jaataa he or anya preyokti dwaara pratisthapit kiya gaya he
 Goals easily change over time
 angrezi ke "idiet", "imbesile " or "moron" shabd aise tatasth shabd the jinka prayog kramshah nanhe bacchon, priskool or praathmik vidhyalay ke maansik umr ke aparipakv vayaskon ke liye hota he
 As with the Gresham theory, negative connotations exclude neutral ones, so the phrase mental disabilities was used
 par ab use bhi ashisht mana jaataa he, jise aamtaur par ek vyakti, vastu, yaa vichaar ke apmaan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The resulting new terms such as "mentally challenged", "with an intellectual disability", "learning difficulties" and "special needs" replaced "retarded"
 isi tarah kaa ek vikaas shaareerik aapangata vaale vyaktiyon ke liye nimnlikhit shabdon ke saath ghatit hua: The word is also more narrow in terms of meaning than "disabeled" or "differently abled"; a person with a recitation or a blind person, for example, cannot be called a "crippled"
) haal hi main hua ek anya vikaas he vyakti-kendrit vaakyansh, jo "persens" jaise shabdon se shuru hota he or jiske baad "wyeth" or "hu aar" nirmaan aata he or phir sangya yaa visheshan hota he jo sthiti kaa varnan karata he
 Examples: "person with Disabilities", "person Who Have Dyslexia" etc
 While these constructions stem from the desire to emphasize the "personality" of the people described, such constructions simply use more words to shed light on similar situations: for example, the discussion of such "people" Those who are blind still today focus exclusively on blind individuals rather than people
 preyokti aise shabdon ko punah prayog main bhi laa sakati he jo nakaaratmak arth kii vajah se upyog se baahar ho chuke hai
 The word "lem" mentioned above, which began to disappear from the vernacular, was resurrected as a slang which generally meant not meeting or boring expectations
 ek preyokti kaa lakshyarth vishay-vishesh bhi ho saktaa he
 In the early 1960s, Major League Baseball franchise owner and promoter Bill Weeks, who was not a part of the leg, disputed the favored euphemism of the time against the "handicapped" and said he liked the "crippled" because it only Is descriptive and does not have the same goals as "handicapped" which limits a person's ability
 
 baad main, hasya abhinayta jorge carlin ne ek prasiddh ekalaap diya ki kaise gambhir muddon ke prati ek preyokti upyukt nazariye ko gaun bana sakati he jaise ucch maansik tanaav sthiti vaale sainikon main sanchayi maansik aghat kii chikitsa samasya kaa varnan karne vaale viksit hote shabd
 He claimed that as the name of the condition became more complex and mysterious, people suffering from the disease began to be treated less seriously as a person with severe illness and as a result received poor treatment
 He also argued that the Vietnam warriors would have received proper care and attention if that condition was still called "shell shock"
 In the same sequence, he echoed the views of Bill Week, stating that "creeped" is a perfectly valid word to heal people ")
 isi tarah, british angrezi main peshiy atitnaav se peedit vyakti ke liye spastic kabhi ek tatasth vivarnak tha
 But children started using "spastic" as an insult after Joey Deacon appeared on Britain's children's TV program, Blue Peter, and is now considered extremely abusive
 1994 main spastic sosayadi ne apana naam badalakar scope rakh liya; tab bacchon ne samaan apmanjanak rup se "scoper" kaa upyog shuru kar diya
 jabaki british angrezi main yah shabd ek apmaan ke rup main viksit ho rahaa tha, yah america angrezi main ek bilkul bhinn rup main viksit ho rahaa tha
 In the US, "spastic" became a non-derogatory synonym for clumsiness, whether physical or mental and stupid and is often used to denote one's own stupidity
 "spastic" ke british or america lakshyarth ke bich antar ko majbooti se 2006 main us vakt dikhaaya gaya jab mahaan golf khilaadi tiger woods ne us varsh ke masters main apane khilne ko varnit karne ke liye "spaz" kaa prayog kiya
 This comment did not go unnoticed in the US, but it created a big uproar in Britain
 is baat par matbhed he ki kya kuch shabd preyokti hai yaa nahin hai
 For example, the phrase blind is sometimes considered a politically correct euphemism for the blind
 haalanki, vijual imparement ek vyapak shabd ho saktaa he, jisamen shaamil hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ve log jinaki ek aankh main aanshik drushti he, yaa aise vyakti jinamein kharaab drushti he, ek samooh jise andhe shabd dwaara hataa diya jayega
 isi prakaar, yahudee vyakti shabd kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he taaki yahudee vaakyansh kaa prayog karte samay purvaagrah yaa samivaad-virdohi sambhavit aaropon se bachaa ja sake, ; tathaapi, yahudee vyakti vaakyansh ko hi kabhi-kabhi samivaad-virdohi sanket dete dekha gaya he
 The team antithesis of euphemisms are: dysfemism, cacofemism and power word
 The first one can either be offensive or jokingly slightly insidious and the second one is generally used intentionally in some aggressive sense
 aakhri vaale kaa prayog kisi bindu ko adhik sahi dikhaane ke liye mukhya rup se ek bahes main kiya jaataa he
 Euphemisms can be constructed in many ways
 periphresis yaa sarkamalcushan ek sabase aam he - ek die gaye "shabd ke aasapaas" bolnaa or bina uskaa uccharan kiye uske bhav ko vyakt karnaa

 samay ke saath, sarkamalcushan, vishesh shabdon yaa vichaaron ke liye sthapit preyokti ke rup main pahachaane jane lagate hai
 Changing the pronunciation or spelling of a forbidden word to create a euphemism is known as forbidden distortion
 angrezi main ascharyajanak rup se kai varjit virupan hai, jisamen se kai us kukhyat chaar varna ke shabd ko sanderbhit karte hai
 In American English, words that are unacceptable on television, such as fuck, can be represented by distortions such as freak - even in children's cartoons
 Some examples of rhymed slang can also serve the same purpose - calling a person a Berk is not as outrageous as calling him a cunt, though Burke is a shortened form of Berkeley Hunt whose rhyme with Kant
 naukarshahi-tantra jaise sena or vishaal nigam aksar adhik suvichaarit prakruti kii preyoktiyon ko utpann karte hai
 Organizations create bipartisan expressions to describe offensive actions in a case that seems neutral or inappropriate
 For example, a term used in the past for contamination by radioactive isotopes is the Sunshine Unit
 sainya sanghathan, logon ko maarthe hai, kabhi-kabhi jaanboojhkar or kabhi kabhi galati se; dwiarthi main, pehle vaale ko lakshya ko niskriy karnaa kah sakate hai or duusare vaale ko samparshvik kshati 
 virdohi-rajya ke dushmano ke hinsak vinaash ko daman ke rup main sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he
 When a soldier is accidentally killed by his side, two common words for it are Friendly Fire and Blue on Blue - "by the Farm" has its own interesting history
 angrezi kaa execution shabd ek sthapit preyokti he jiskaa arth he kisi vyakti ko ek nyaayik prakriya ke dwaara yaa uske bina maar daalana, yah multah, maarane ko nirdisht karata he arthath mrityu dand kaa nishpaadan, jo ek namit vyakti ko maarane ke liye ek adhikari, jail warden, yaa anya adhikari ke liye praadhikaar he
 In legal usage, execution may also mean following other orders; For example, the writ of execution, in American legal application, is a directive to enforce a civil money order by the confiscation of property
 isi tarah, kisi apradhi ko zehar dekar maarane ke liye ghaatak injection ko khud hi ek preyokti mana ja saktaa he
 The original meaning of aborish was birth before time and then it means birth before viability
 The meaning of the word "abort" was expanded and began to mean any kind of premature termination, such as aborting the launch of a rocket
 Euphemisms have developed around the original meaning
