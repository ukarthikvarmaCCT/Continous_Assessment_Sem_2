 It is noteworthy that after the coup of "U Nu" government on March 2, 1962, "ni Bin" took the reins of Varma's rule, which is why the immediate President was jealous of "ni Bin" Thant
 unhone thant kii mrityu ke baad yah farmaan jari kiya tha ki you thant ko kisi bhi sarkari bhagidaari yaa samaaroh ke bina hi dafan kiya jaye

 sakriy filter yaa active filter ve analog electronic filter hai jinamein kisi active avyav kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The special thing is that the filter functionality can be increased by using amplifiers in the design of a filter, that is, some of the drawbacks of passive filters can be overcome
 lo-paas, hai-paas, band-paas or band-stop aadi sabhi filtering kaaryon ke liye active filter banaaye jate hai
 Active filters have several benefits
 active filtron kii kuch kamiyaan bhi hai
 Active filters are made in various combinations, the main ones being- neeche 1000 Hz cat-of tathaa 4-order vaale batterworth filter kaa udhaaharan diya gaya he
 It is constructed from salene-key sales
 neeche is filter kaa paripath diya gaya he- The frequency-response of this filter is given in the figure below and the phase plot in red color) - anda gol yaa andakar jivit vastu he jo bahut se praaniyon ke maadaa dwaara paidaa kii jaati he
 Most animal eggs have a hard cover that protects the eggs
 yadhyapi anda jeevadhariyon dwaara apni santane paidaa karne kaa maarg he, kintu anda khaane ke kaam bhi aata he
 Protein and choline are rich in it in terms of nutrients
 prayek jati kii chidiyon ke andon main, thodi bahut bhinnata bhale hi ho, par inaki apni ek visheshta hoti he
 The size, shape and color of the eggs of birds of each race is unique
 pakshiyon ke jivan or unke angon ke aakaar, maap, sataha kii rachana or rang main ek sambandh he
 Similarly, there is a relation between the number of eggs within a bulk or group and the number of clots in a season
 andey kii maap mukhyat: anda denevaali chidiya ke dealdol par nirbhar karti he, kintu yah aavashyak nahin he ki anupaat hameshaa ek ho
 There are two reasons for this : murgi ke andey kaa jo aakaar hota he, vahi aakaar praaia: anya chidiyon ke andon kaa hota he
 The egg is long in one direction and has one end rounded and the other end slightly pointed
 andey ek chor par gol or duusare chor par nukile hone se saralata se ludhak nahin pate
 Also, with the pointed portion of the eggs being centered in the middle of the nest and their spherical portion facing out, if the nest contains three to four eggs, they all easily hatch
 kuch chidiyon ke andey lagbhag golakaar hote hai
 Owl eggs are spherical and bacassi eggs are thin and round at both ends
 kuch chidiyon ke andon kii satahen chikani hoti hai, kuch kii chamakili, kuch kii bahut adhik paalishdaar or kuch kii khurdari tathaa khadianuma hoti he
 The color of eggs also varies in different sparrows
 kuch chidiyon ke andey bilkul safed hote hai, kintu kuch ke andey rangeen, hare, nile, bhure or lalachaunh hote hai
 Some have the same color of eggs and some have pinto or speckled
 chitiyaan dhabbe ke rup main, athwa chaktton ke rup main hoti he or thodi athwa atyadhik sankhya main hoti hai
 The spots may be evenly scattered on the surface of the eggs, or more in one part and less in another
 kuch jati ke pakshiyon main ek hi jati ke antargat vibhinn sadasyon ke andon ke rang or chihnon main vyaktigat bhinnata hoti he
 Egg color is predominantly defensive
 atev hari daaliyon par die janevaale andon kaa rang haraa or jameen par die janevaale andon kaa rang praaia: bhura hota he
 Cotter or burrow eggs are often white, so that birds can detect them even in the dark
 gilmaat or regerbil keval ek hi anda detii hai, paravat yaa junglee kabutar or garud do, dhomara yaa gangachilli kii vibhinn jatiyaan teen or tittibh kii anek jatiyaan chaar andey detii hai
 Many species lay up to five to six eggs
 kuch gaanevaali choti kism kii chidiyon main saat aath se lekar das baarah tak andey milte hai
 Some hunting birds and ducks have even higher numbers
 adhikansh chidiyaan, yadi unke andey chura liye jaaain, athwa nasht ho jaaain, athwa andon ko tyaagane ke liye ve baadhya kar di jaayen, to phir se andey detii hai, kyonki har pakshi ke andon kii ek nishchit sankhya hoti he
 Until this number is reached, it does not stop laying eggs
 chidiyaan saadharantaya ek ritu main ek hi baar ade detii hai
 Some singing birds produce children two or three times during the season
 jin chidiyon ke andey or bachche adhik nasht hote hai, athwa jo alpaayu hoti hai, unamem janan teevr gati se or andon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 The age of sparrows also affects their number of eggs
 pratham baar maan bananevaali chidiyaan kam or duusari yaa teesri baar andey denevaali chidiyaan adhik andey detii hai
 When the number of eggs is complete, their army begins
 pakshi badi lagan or tatparta se andey sete hai, apane pankhons se unhen garam rakhte tathaa unki raksha karte hai : In most castes, both males and females perform the function of ovulation, even though the hatching works slightly more then the other
 kabhi kabhi din main maadaa andey seti he or raatri main nar
 In some castes, only females lay eggs, but in such a state the male raises food for it
 kisi kisi jati main nar or maadaa baari baari sein aate jate rahete hai
 During the egg-intake period, the female gets attention in hatching and such a concentration is created that if someone removes her eggs and keeps any other thing, like stone pieces, ballasts, etc
, then she will be without See, they will sit and sit on them
 bahudhaa aisa dekha gaya he ki andon ke kharaab yaa nirjeev ho jane par bhi maadaa ek lambii avadhi tak unhen seti rahati he
 In pigeons, the male incubates the egg with great fervor
 yahi nahin, balki maadaa ko hataakar swayan andon par baithta he
 The male cannot give himself, but in the desire of childbirth, he somehow binds the female and binds her, fetches the eggs from the female and then performs all the activities of her hatching and grooming herself with great enthusiasm
 lapland or ouk jati ke pakshiyon main nar kii sankhya adhik he, maadaa kii kam
 Thus, not all male pairs are successful in tying, but their desire for hatching and rearing of children does not go through their heart
 isse thik vipareet kuch pakshi aise bhi hai, jo andon ko swayan na sekar dusron se sevate hai
 Cuckoo, papiha etc
 are the main among them, who steal their eggs in the nests of crows, sparrows or satbhaiya etc
 and fool them and take care of them as midwives
 kuch aise pakshi hai, jo andon ko na to swayan sete hai or na auron se sevate hai, balki unhen dhoop ke taap se pakaakar unki raksha karte hai
 a bird named Ostrich prepares the pit with the rubbing of its chest and erects a wall by placing sand with a beak around it
 phir isi main maadaaen, praaia: 20 se 30 tak, andey dete hai
 Ostrich does not have a single female, a male has many wives and all of them pass eggs in turn
 andey dene kaa kaam puraa ho jane par, inpar ek halki si baaluu kii parat bicha di jaati he
 These eggs are warmed by the rays of the sun throughout the day
 ratrikaal main ye pakshi inpar baithper inhen ushnata pradaan karte hai
 There are many birds, which are built near a hot spring and lay eggs in them, then cover them and go elsewhere
 jharne ke ushn jal se ye andey garam rahete hai
 At the end of the time, they come back and remove the top soil, then the children come out after breaking the eggs
 jahaan atyadhik garmi padati hai, vahaan ke pakshi andon ko thandha rakhane kii vyavastha karte hai, garam rakhane kii nahin
 For this, they soak their beaks in water and soak eggs in them, so that they do not get damaged due to excessive heat
 sevankaal bhi, chidiyon main vibhinn hota he
 In larger sparrows or in sparrows whose children develop well, the intake period is longer
 kisi kisi main sevankaal ek maheene kaa or kisi kisi main do saptaah se bhi kam kaa hota he
 Months are spent incubating eggs on a bird
 murgi ko anda sene main teen saptaah lagate hai, teetar ko chaar, hans ko paanch tathaa cander naamak pakshi ko puure do maheene
 Birds' eggs are laid outside and embryonic development takes place inside the eggs
 bhrun ke purna viksit ho jane par vihang shishu andey rupi kaidakhane se baahar aane ke liye apni chonch se baar baar prahaar karata he or andey ke bichon bich, athwa anya kisi chaude sthal par jatibhed ke anusaar, ek daraar ho jaati he or shishu baahar nikal aata he
 At that time he remains soaked with a fluid, which dries up quickly due to wind
 murgi, teetar, shuturamurg aadi ke bachche to nikalate hi daudna shuru kar dete hai, par tote, phakhte or coy aadi ke shishu kai dinon tak aankh nahin khol pate,
 They remain in a state of immortality and spend their infancy days in weeks in Dhansale
 andey se baahar aane par shishu chidiya ke pratham kuch saptaah kuch vishesh kathinaaiyon evam khataron ke hote hai
 These days she is not only small and weak, but often unable to swallow food herself and is also helpless by flying
 bhinn jati ke pakshiyon ke shishu bhinn avasthaa main utpann hote hai or is aadhaar par unka vargeekaran nimnlikhit do pramukh shreniyon main kiya ja saktaa he : The eyes of a dormant baby are open from birth and their body is covered with soft feathers
 ye aarambh se hi satark tathaa chanchal hote hai or daud yaa tair sakate hai
 Yes, if they are not teased, then after birth they would like to remain silent for a few hours
 ye prarambh se hi apana dana swayan chugana shuru kar dete hai
 Ducks and chickens are good examples of this
 junglee chidiyon main tittibh, jalkukkuti, batakh or shikaar kii anya chidiyon ke shishu bhi aisa hi karte hai
 Another feature of hunting birds is that they also start flying soon
 needvasi shishu janm ke pashchaat bade hone tak ghonsle main hi pade rahete hai or inhen aahaar ke liye apane maan baap par hi purnat: nirbhar rahanaa padataa hai
 They are blind and helpless at birth and more or less bare in most cases; That is, they are non-smoking and unattractive
 bataakhi, kilkila ; or harith kashthakut ke shishu bilkul nange utpann hote hai
 Cormorant and Buck are a group of birds whose children are completely naked at birth, that is, they live on very little on their body
 pakshi jis tatparta ke saath andey sete hai, usee tatparta se apni santan kaa paalan poshan evam rakshan bhi karte hai
 In child protection it is often seen that birds do not even worry about their lives
 santanraksha main tarah-tarah kii bahanebaajiyaan karke ye pakshi aagatuk ko achambhe main bhi daale dete hai
 Often they start to see it and hang it as if they were injured by a hunter
 dushman shikari, badhik, shwaan, shrugaladi inhen pakadaney kii aashaa lekar jab inkaa peechha karte hai, to ye dur tak chakma dete hue nikal jate hai or tab ekaek teji se udakar kahin chal dete hai
 In this way, taking the enemy away from the nest and astray him, so that he can move in some other direction and avoid the calamity on the babies of the needles
 chidiyaan dusron kii aankh main dhul jhonknaa bhi khub jaanati hai
 When they are sometimes surrounded, they lie dead and lie on the ground, which the viewer considers them dead and moves forward
 phir ye sheeghra jameen chhodkar aage bhaag khadi hoti he
 Sometimes even if caught, they pretend to be dead, so that we can leave them as dead

 Syed Hyder Raza was born in Babaria in Narsinghpur district, Madhya Pradesh, to the district's deputy forest officer Syed Mohammed Razi and Tahira Begum, and this was where he spent the early years of his life and painting at the age of 12 Learned, after which he moved to Damoh, Madhya Pradesh, at the age of 13, where he received his schooling from Government High School, Damoh

 unke chitra abhivyakti ke chithran se lekar paridrishy chitrakala tak viksit hai
 Passing through the fluent watercolors of his landscapes and depictions of the city in the early 1940s, he moved to the more expressive language of painting, the depiction of the brain

 In France, he continued experimenting with the stream of Western modernity, moving from the depiction of expression to the depiction of larger landscapes and eventually incorporating tantric elements of Indian manuscripts
 jabaki unke samakalinon ne adhik aupchaarik vishay chune, raza ne 1940 or 50 ke dashakon ke paridrishyon ke chithran par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa faisla kiya, jo kuch had tak frans main rahane se prerit tha
 In 1959, she married French artist Janine Mongillat and in 1962 he became a part-time lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, USA
 shuru main raza ko france ke gramin ilaakon ke graamy jivan ne aakrisht kiya

 By the 1970s, Raza was unhappy and restless with his own work and wanted to find a new direction and deeper authenticity in his work and to get away from what he called plastic art
 unke bharat daure, visheshkar ajanta va ellora kii gufaaon ke daure, jiske baad unhonen banaras, gujarat tathaa rajasthan kii yatra kii, ne unhen apni jadon kaa ehsaas karaayaa tathaa bhartiya samskruti ko nikatataa se jaanane ke liye prerit kiya, jiskaa parinaam 'bindu' ke rup main saamne aayaa, jo ek chitrakaar ke rup main unke purnjanam ko darshata tha
 Bindu emerged in 1980 and led his work in greater depth to the new Indian outlook he discovered and Indian culture
 unke dwaara varnit 'bindu' kii shuruyaat ke kai kaarnon main se ek unki praathmik skool shikshak he, jisane yah jaanane ke pashchaat ki unamem ekaagratha kii kami he, blikeboard par ek bindu bana diya tathaa unhen is par dhyaan lagane ke liye kaha
 After the introduction of 'bindu', he added new dimensions to his thematic work in later decades with themes centered around the triangle, linking space and time to Indian concepts as well as 'nature-men', His transformation from a person expressing himself to a picture and becoming a guru who reached its depth was complete
 shuruaati chitron main adwitiya urja yukt rang ab adhik komal hone ke saath-saath adhik gatisheel ho gaye hai
 Raza abandoned geometric landscapes and expressive paintings for 'dots'
 raza bindu ko astitv or rachana kaa centre maanate hai jo rup va rang ke saath-saath urja, dhwani, antariksh tathaa samay kii disha main pragati kar rahaa he
 His work took a new turn in 2000 when he began to express his growing insights and thoughts on Indian spirituality, and created paintings based on the themes of Kundalini, Naga and Mahabharata

 bharat ke pyaare raza kaa janm madhya bharat hua tha or ve jangalon ke bich paley bade the
 Madhya Pradesh is far from the sea, there are mountains, but not huge mountains, and most of them have tribal rulers and a calm atmosphere
 ek bachche ke rup main, raza ne avashya hi nishachar junglee jaanwaron ko dhire se aate jate or gahare rang ke pakshiyon ko nam tathaa shushk jangalon se udate hue dekha hoga or unke shuruaati chitron main adhikansh paridrishy ke rup main the
 It happened after a long, long time that the lines drawn by his hand, or rather the footprints, became 'dots'
 bindu ek chamkila atyalp dot, chingaari, nila moti he jisase duniya shuru hoti he or jisamen waapas simat jaati he
 And as stated in Hindu religious thought, energy and time and space came into existence from the point, and perhaps the first sound came after the first light
 hindu aksar bindu kaa upyog ekaagratha ke liye karte hai or ek bachche ke rup main raza ko bhi, unke shikshak dwaara diwaar par ek bindu ko dekhne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 This helped the child's distracted mind and perhaps therefore never forgot its effect
 Great thoughtful brain and creative talent, want to know about things, they experience thoughts, enjoy quiet journeys and touch the soul
 ve khud ko dhire se kehete hai: main kahaan se aayaa tha, kya mujhe kisi din pataa chal paayegaa ki yah sab kya tha? bhartiya aksar vichaar karte hai: kya yahi sab jivan he? koi jaadu yaa ras-vidha ko kaise maap saktaa he? koi chintan yaa sannaate ke vichaar kaise bataa saktaa he? Raza has probably discovered it through self-inspection and happiness, as the search for a hero is always for permanent enjoyment
 unka kaam jivan ke mul tathaa pratikon ko pradarshit karata he, jinhen kabeelai chitrakaaron tathaa atyadhik parishkrut bhartiya darshanikon ne sadiyon se taiyaar kiya he, is par vichaar tathaa manan kiya he
 His work is like that of the modern Tantric tankhas which arouses wonder, joy and meditation in the viewer
 mere liye, yah maatr shanti nahin he, apitu kashmiri shiv darshan ke liye kampan, dhadkan, spandan or ek shantipurna ghar vaapasi, trikonon main shiv kii jhalak, bindu tathaa anugrah ke chadhaav or utaar hai
 Yes, Genesis, Destruction and Protection are miracles that everyone knows about
 raza ke paas anya do chamatkaar hai niyantran or anugrah
 ham sabhi is bare main aashwast ho sakate hai ki vahaan abhi bhi ek chota bindu he jo shuru hota he or samaapt hota he, tathaa phir se shuru hota he tathaa jo 'hamaari ichchhaaon ke hryday dwaara saans legaa, 


 bukamp, hawa tathaa aag ke madhyam se bolegaa lekin usame phir bhi shaanti kii ek choti si aawaaj he'
 haa, sannaate main unke kaam ko dekhne se meraa sar jhukaane or prarthana karne tathaa dhire-dhire anya companon, anya ayaamon ko anubhav karne kaa man karata he
 Small irregular temples with deep sanctity of the sanctum sanctorum should be captured in their paintings which were long before religions were formed
 shaayad ye shuruuaati pratik hai: trikon, aadmi-aurat, bhagwaan, aadmi se bhagwaan se anugrah or baar-baar, chah nokon vaale taare va vishuddh chakra

 In my view, instead of a rich house, in a far cooler corridor, their work would be best, like a stone temple where we meditate and return peacefully on a journey, a pilgrimage
 shuruyaat main bindu, ankahi dhwani, bina mahasoos kiye gaye, andekhee kampan the tathaa ham va bhagwaan bindu kii roshni se upje tathaa is chamatkaarik brahmad main viksit hue or iske dhul ke ek kan, ek chamkile maun ke rup main samaapt ho gaye

 Later he saw the point and painted it and then also entered the white period
 aag or samudr ke unke praathmik rang bahya antariksh jaise gahare nile rang hai or un jagahon par pile hai jahaan prakaash kaa samavesh hota he
 Like most Indian travelers, Raza traveled between East and West in a relaxed and normal manner, the way we see most other places as an extension of our home and our own
 raza ke "citiscape" or "baraamula in ruins" chitra hindustan ke vibhaajan tathaa mumbai ke dangon main musalamaanon ke utpeedan ke dauraan prakat hone vaale unke dukh tathaa pidaa ko darshaate hai
 Becoming a minority, being sensitive and attentive is a life that many people around the world live daily

 So on the other hand as a personal history for my family, these important years of 1947‚Äì1948 were years of tragedy and separation
 july 1947 main meri maa kaa mumbai main apane ghar main nidhan ho gaya, 1948 main agle saal ke shuru main, mere pita kaa mandla main nidhan ho gaya
 My personal history and my personal sense of loss is associated with this period filled with riots and murders and hatred
 "

 Ancient techniques and symbols, insulted by the British, were once again giving shape and shape to the artists of India
 france ko takanic ke ek shikshak ke rup main mahatva diya gaya tha
 SH Raza regularly visits India to relive India and its life and its many forms
 adhikansh bharatiyon ke liye, mukhya dhara ke hindu vichaar or muslim manyata vishwaas or sachai ke har roj ke pahalu hai, tathaa koi bhi ek duusare ke liye ajanabi nahin he
 Therefore Muslims like Raza, Hussain, Ghulam Rasool Santosh use Hindu symbols fluently and naturally, as they experience them everyday
 yahaan koi ajanabi nahin he yaa koi videshi kaa mudda nahin he, yah keval saajha gyaan he
 Raza spent a summer vacation in California, teaching and saw Paulak's lively joy and Rothko's mysterious works
 However, this search for any direct effect is meaningless
 unhonen manushya ke saahasik sawaalon par khoj kii: main yahaan kyon hum, main kahaan ja rahaa hum, kyon, vah ascharyajanak chiz kya he jo jaagrukta, chetana kehalaati he
 If we persist, will we somehow know what this was all about? Raza portrays the point as the sustainer of birth and composition and existence and moves to the description of shapes, geometry and colors and the two-dimensional depiction of space, sound and time
 uddhran:"meri prerana lekhak yaa chitrakaaron or yahaan tak ki ustad jaise sangeetkaaron ke vichaar rahe hai jinhonen kaha ki, 'apane kaanon se dekho, apni ankhon se suno
'-saiyad haidar raza "my work reflects my own inner experience and my involvement with nature's mysteries and form, expressed by color, line, space, and light
 "tatv kii khoj ne mujhe divaana kar diya
 bhartiya avadharanaon, pratimaa vigyaan, sanketon or pratikon ne is khoj ko majboot kiya
 Nature as nature, which is the supreme creation power, the embryonic power contained in the seed, the male-female base, the ever-present sprouts in nature, events such as pregnancy and birth have made my concept from 'seen nature' to 'nature-fantasy' "changed to"
 "main france isliye gaya kyonki is desh ne mujhe chitrakala kii takanic tathaa vigyaan kii shiksha di

 But despite my French experience, the expressions in my paintings come directly from India

 hathdharm, raddhanth yaa dogma kaa arth he - 'kattar dharmik dharna yaa mantavya'
 Initially "dogma" was used in the sense of a command or order; Back then, it began to mean such a notion, which no person believes, but remains firmly in force, no matter how devout and equally confident
 ab is shabd kaa prayog praaia: dharmavidya ke sambandh main hota he
 Dogma is a belief that all members of a denomination have to accept, because it is divine light in its essence
 is prakaash ko, jab aisa karne kii aavashyaktaa ho, koi adhikaar sampann vyakti yaa vishesh vichaarsabha sutarabaddh karti he
 Jesus' statements to Christians, Buddha's statements to Buddhists are such intentions
 inhen siddhant nahi kah sakate, kyonki inke siddh karne kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 The dominant dogma is the form of "trinity" for the Christian denomination
 trigut main "pita', "putr' or "pavitra aatma' teen swadhin chetan sanmilit hai
 How three conscious beings can become part of one conscious is not a matter of deliberation, but a divine invention

 It was also decided that "holy spirit" is born of both father and son
 1545-63 main, trent kii vichaarsabha main jo mantavya nirnit hue, ve praaia: ab bhi roman catholic sampradaay ke liye maanya hai

 At the time of initiation the Buddhist monk had to take the following fasts - isa or gautam buddha ne jo kuch kaha, apane adhikaar se kaha

 There are seven parts of faith - har haalat main vishwasi maanata he ki "dogma" satya he or adhikaryukt he; yah khulaa prashn nahin

 Overseas Hindi writer in America
 udanevaala spacketi daanav pastafaari dharm kaa ishwar he
 It was created in 2005 to protest the teaching of Intelligent Design and Creationism in US government schools
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion
 udanevaale spagetti daanav kaa pehla varnan 2005 main bobi henderson dwaara america ke kensas rajya ke shiksha board ko likhi gai ek vyangapurn chitthee main miltaa he
 With this letter, he was opposing the board's permission to teach intelligent design instead of evolution in science classes
 chitthee main ve spacketi or metbal kii tarah dikhne vaale devtaa or brahmand ke srujankarta main apni aasthaa jataa kar crieshnism kaa vyangy karte hai
 They argue that their assumptions are just as valid as the assumptions of intelligent design, and say that their assumptions should therefore have equal time with evolution and intelligent design in science classes
 apni lokapriyata or pahunch ke kaaran udanevaale spacketi daanav ko aksar rasal kii chaaydani ke samakaleen roopaantar kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki henderson ne kaha he ki "pastafaari dharm main ek hi dharm manyata kii anumati he ‚Äì dharm manyataon kii naamanzoori", phir bhi pastafaari log kuch manyataayen rakhte hai
 According to the Pastafari creation myth, an invisible and inexplicable flying Spaghetti demon created the universe ten thousand years ago after drinking too much alcohol
 in manyataon ke anusaar prithvi ke trutipurna hone kaa kaaran is daanav kaa srijan ke dauraan nashe main chur hona he
 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors
 jab radiocarbon dating jaise vaigyanik maap liye jate hai, tab udanevaala spagetti daanav aankado ko badal detaa he taaki vaigyanik samajhen ki prithvi arabon varsh puraani he
 The paradise concept of pastoralism includes a beer volcano and a factory producing nude dancers
 
 Pasta Hell is similar, but beer is rancid and dancers have sexually transmitted diseases
 pastafaari manyataon ke anusaar samudri lutere vaastaviktaa main divya praani or mul pastafaari hai
 Pastafari believes that the notion of pirates being "thieves and ostracized" is the result of false information being spread by Christian theologians in the medieval period and today by the International Union of Krishna Consciousness
 inke anusaar, vaastaviktaa main samudri lutere "shanti-priy khoj yatri or sadbhaav ke prasarak" the jo bacchon ko mithaiyaan baantate the
 They say that today's pirates have nothing to do with "ancient lively pirates"
 iske atirikt, bermuda tribhuj se samudri or hawaii jahaajon ke rahasypurna dhang se gaayab hone ke liye pastafaari samudri luteron ke bhuton ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 Pastafari celebrates "international Day of Speak Like Pirates" on 19 September every year
 naastikta ¬∑ isai dharm ¬∑ hindu dharm ¬∑ islam ¬∑ yahudee dharm ¬∑ sikh dharm Jauljibi is a small market located at the confluence of the Kali and Gori rivers on the indo-nepal border
 yah naam dono ore ke bazaaron ke liye prayukt hota he, jisamen se nepal kii ore basaa bazaar bharat kii ore based bazaar se chota he
 The markets on both sides are connected by a suspension bridge
 panchadravid kaa shabdic arth he- paanch dravid
 That is, five special areas that Dravid takes in the foreground - Dravid, Karnataka, Telang, Gurjar, and Maharashtra, but later this term started being used for all those highly elite Brahmins
 According to Skandpuran, in the south of Vindhyachal, originally there is a Brahmin group of Vedic Varnashram Dharmavalamvi people called Panchadravidas
 Dravida:, Karnatka:, Tailanga:, Gorjara: and Maharashtra: These were called Panchadravidas
 These people lived in the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu etc
 or left their native states for various reasons and settled elsewhere - especially in North India
 gujarat ke brahman bhi isamen shaamil hue
 a verse in 'brahmanottatti-darpan' refers to the occupation of these Panchadravidas vipras as follows- "karnatakasch telunga:dravinasch tapodhanah | maharashtrah gurjarashch panchadravid bandhavah ||panchadravinvikhyataonvindhyadakshinvasina
" The Indian Museum is the best museum in India
 isamen pracheen vastuon, yudhsaamagree, gahane, kankal, mummy, jeevashm, tathaa mughal chitra aadi kaa durlabh sangrah he
 It was founded in 1814 by a Danish botanist named Dr
 Nathaniel Wallick
 yah asia kaa sabase purana or bharat kaa sabase bada sangrahalay he
 i masooda ativardhan masoodon kaa ek rog he
 In this, the size of the gum becomes much larger than normal
 masoodon kaa ativardhan kai vibhinn kaarnon se hota he
 Therefore, it is important to understand the real cause of growth and to treat it accordingly
 jaisaa ki pehle ullekh kiya he, massodon kaa izaafaa ke anek kaaran ho sakate he
 The most common cause is chronic gingival enlargement; In which the gums are clinically soft and colorless
 is pattica l jeevanu ke kaaran hota he utakon dwaara edema ke liye jokhim ke kaaran hota he cellular ghuspaith sankramak or se lambi he or jaise paaramparik periodontal upachaar, ilaaj ke saath scalling or jad planing
 sthitiyon main jo jeern sujan gingival izaafaa planing shaamil fibrotic mahatvapurn ghatakon scalling or jad he ki karne ke liye jawaab nahin ujagar karne ke liye or jab sankochan guzarana gingivectomy ke rup main janaa hataane kii shalya chikitsa ke saath ilaaj kiya jaataa he ek prakriya ke saath sabase adhik baar, utak
 Gingivitis and enlargement are often seen in those inhaled through the mouth
 nirjaleekaran ke parinaam ke rup main ek sataha par jalan dwaara laayaa he, lekin jis tarah se yah pradarshan kiya gaya he nahin kiya gaya he kaaran hota he
 Gum enlargement is associated with three different classes of drugs: kai pranaligat rog, maukhik abhivyaktiyon pesh kar sakate hai - jis main izaafaa avasthaa shaamil ho saktaa he - kuch khaas sthiti sambandhit hote hai or kuch rog se sambandhit hai: Accumulation and retention of flatulence are the main causes of inflammatory gingival enlargement
 jokhim kaarak main ghatiya maukhik swatchta or masoodon ke jalan - anuchit sthaapak or vishamdantvigyaan upkaran ke kaaran - shaamil hote hai
 Drug-induced enlargement is associated with genetic predisposition - and not with inflammation
 dawa- prerit rog main, masoodon kaa vruddhi ko rokna aasaan he - dawa band kiya janaa chaiye
 baharhaal, yah hameshaa ek vikalp nahin he
 In such a situation, if possible, alternative medicine therapy may be employed - to avoid side effects
 In immunosuppressive case, tacrolimus cichlosporin is an available option
 is se kam masoodon kaa ijapha kam hota he, lekin yah bhi gurda-vishaiylla he dihyadaropyaridin vyutpann isradipidin, nifedipin kaa kaam kar saktaa he - calcium channel ke kuch upyogon ke liye or yah masoodon kaa utpann nahin karata he
 It is seen in boxer dogs and other 'bardicephalic' breeds, and the sponger spuniel
 It usually starts around middle age and continues to progress
 masoodon ke kuch kshetron kaaphi bade ho jate hai; lekin ye baaki masoodon ke saath sirf chota shetra main lagaav rakhata he - or yah puri tarah se daant ko cover kar sakate hai
 Gum infection and inflammation are common in this condition
 sangyaaharan ke tahat, scalepel blade se, masoodon ke bade hue kshetron ke katautee kar sakate hai, lekin yah aamtaur par phir se badhata he
 Gum enlargement is a possible sequel to gingivitis
 jaise manushya main dekha jaataa he, yah sichlosporin kaa upyog karne ke dushprabhav ho sakate hai

 It was released worldwide on October 26, 2007, but a day before it was released in the UK, the film was a huge hit at the Indian box office and also did well overseas
 isaki safalataa ke kaaran, film ke vitarakon, shri ashtavinayak sinevijan limited, ne ghoshnaa kii ki jab ve met ko korporate antity mozar bear ke dwaara chaar dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon main phir se banaaya jaayegaa-- tamil, telugu,kannada or malayalam
 Aditya Kashyap, who is the son of a famous industrialist, is deeply distressed, becoming more unhappy by attending the wedding of a girl who falls in love with someone else
 use duniya se nazaren milaane main shame mahasoos hoti he, vah shaadi ke samaaroh ko chhod kar chalaa jaataa he or raat ko ek train pakadta he
 On the train, he meets a beautiful, talkative girl Geet Dhillon, who is going to his home in Bhatinda from Mumbai
 shuru main, aditya geet se bahut chidh jaataa he or har baar usase milanaa uske liye kisi maansik yantranaa se kam nahin hota he
 She tells him about her plans to elope with her lover Anshuman, as well as that her parents will not agree to her marriage
 geet aditya ko itnaa pareshaan kar detii he ki vah train se utar jaataa he
 Geet tries to call her back on the train, in the same mishap, her train leaves and the two stand at a desolate station, Geet's luggage is left in the train and she has no money
 geet aditya ko bataati he ki ab use hi surakshit rup se uske ghar punjab tak pahunchaana hoga
 The two embark on a joyous journey through the North Indian territories, reaching the house of song with buses, taxis and camels
 aditya jo geet ke saath bahut sa samay bitaa chukaa hota he, vah jivan ko lekar phir se sakaaratmak mahasoos karne lagata he
 When they arrive home, Geet's housemates get mistaken that they both love each other, but they both quickly convince Geetha's family that there is nothing between them
 aditya geet ke parivaar ko bataata he ki vah ek sangeetkaar he, vah nahin chahta ki ve log use ek prasiddh udyogpati ke rup main pahchaan len or uskaa parivaar is baat ko sweekaar kar letaa he
 a few days later, Geet's family sees a boy for her, who is about to come see him to marry her
 jab vah ladkaa vahaan aata he, geet aditya ke saath pyaar kaa naatak karti he, vah geet or aditya ko ek saath kuch antarang kshan bitaate hue dekh letaa he
 Later that night, Geet runs away from home with Aditya to marry Anshuman in Manali
 baharhaal, geet kii bahan un donon ko ek saath bhaagate hue dekh leti he or puure parivaar ko is bare main bataa detii he
 They quickly try to catch them, but this justifies their suspicion that they both love each other
 ve donon manali pahunch jate hai or phir apane alag alag raste pakadte hai
 Due to the impact of the song, with a new faith and a positive attitude towards life, Aditya reaches Mumbai and leads his company to peak success
 uske pahunchane ke lagbhag nau maheene ke baad, vah ek nayaa utpaada launch karata he, "geet" ke naam par ek colling card
 Geet's family watches the launch on TV and leaves for Mumbai to meet Aditya
 aditya yah sunakar hairaan ho jaataa he ki geet ab tak ghar waapas nahin pahunchi he
 He takes the responsibility of finding her and bringing them back home
 aditya phir se manali jaataa he, jahaan use aashaa he ki geet apane nae pati ke saath hogi, lekin yahaan pahunch kar use pataa chalata he ki anshuman ne geet se shaadi karne se inkaar kar diya he or use waapas bhej diya he
 After saying a few spiteful words to Anshuman, Aditya sets out to find the song
 ant main vah use himalay ke ek shahar shimla main dhund letaa he, vah yah dekh kar hairaan ho jaataa he ki geet kya se kya ho gayi he: ek shant, chup, dukhi ladki, jo ek skool main padhaati he
 He prepares her to face these situations, he somehow brings her back to Mumbai and things start to happen in her favor
 haalanki, anshuman aakar bataata he ki use mahasoos hua ki usne galat kiya he or apane sambandh ko phir se sudhaarney kii koshish karata he
 Initially, Geet does not think she will accept his apology but Aditya asks him to do so, despite that he himself falls in love with her
 teenon bhatinda waapas pahunchate hai, ye bataane ke liye ki geet or anshuman shaadi karnaa chaahate hai
 In Bathinda, the family again feels that Geet and Aditya are in love with each other and in this confusion, they are not able to clear the misconceptions of the family
 is galatfahami ko dur karne kii koshish main, geet ko yah ahsaas hota he ki vah vastav main aditya se hi pyaar karne lagi he, anshuman se nahin or isliye un donon kii shaadi ho jaati he
 He is so busy fighting his insecurities that he does not enjoy his life, then the song comes into his life
 film par purv nirmaan kaa kaary 2007 main shuru hua jab shri ashtavinayak sinevijan limited ne ghoshnaa kii ki nirdeshak imtiyaaj ali vaastavik jivan ke jode shahid or karina kapur ko lekar ek film banaayenge jo unke jivan kii pehali "phul flejd romantic drama" hogi
 When Ali started casting for the film, Kareena Kapoor was the director's first choice to play the song Dhillon and Shahid Kapoor was cast for the role of Aditya Kashyap, Ali found him meeting the actor with a poster boy Far more
 do mukhya abhinaytaon par, ali ne tippanee kii, "mujhe ek ladki chahie thi, jo train chhot jane par swaabhaavik dikhaayi de, use mek-ap nahin karnaa tha, use aisa dikhnaa tha ki vah bahut gusse main he, batooni he, dilachasp he lekin pareshaan karne vaali nahin
 i was never a fan of her and i have not seen much of her roles, but i knew she would be fine as a song, when i met her, i realized that she is not a forgettable actor, she has been in many films
 i have arrived usne jivan main bahut kuch saha he or us paripakvata ko kabhi baahar nahin laayaa
 He is perfect for the role of a young, mature, quiet man

 Pandora's Box is a story in Greek mythology
 "box" vastav main pandora ko diya gaya ek bada jaar tha ), jisamen duniya kii sabhi buraaiyaan nihit thim
 When Pandora opened the jar, all the contents contained in the jar were freed, but to an expectation
 aaj, pandora ke box ko kholane kaa arth he buraaiyaan paidaa karnaa, jise kabhi nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Pandora was the first woman on earth
 pandora ko shilp kaushal ke devtaa, zeeus ke aadesh par banaaya gaya, jinhone pandora ko banane kaa aadesh hefstas ko diya tha
 Hephaestus created him using water and earth, while other gods gave him many gifts
 jab promethius ne mount olimpus se agni ko chura liya, zeeus ne promethius ke bhai, epimethius ko pandora ko saunp kar iskaa badla liya
 At the same time, Pandora was given a jar and was ordered not to open it under any circumstances
 Despite this warning, Pandora opened the jar in curiosity
 aisa karne par, isamen nihit buraaiyaan duniya main aa gayin
 The scared Pandora immediately closed the jar, so that she could lock the hope in it as Zeus had wished
 anya sanskarnon main, ummid baahar nahin aati he, haalanki pandora ke myth kaa mukhya uddeshy yah bataanaa he ki buraai duniya main maujuud kyon he
 It can also be considered as a precursor that has not been liberated
 is kahani kii kai vyakhyaayein is tathy kii andekhi karti hai ki pandora ke box main ve sabhi buree chijen hai jo maanavtaa ko biimaar kar dengeen or ummid bhi box ke andar thi, is prakaar se myth kaa ye doosraa adhyay puri tarah se gaayab he
 The original Greek word that was used was pithos, which is a large jar, sometimes as large as a small human being told that it would sleep one at a time)
 iskaa upyog wine, tel, anaaj, yaa anya saamagree ke bhandaran ke liye, yaa, dharmik rup se maanav sharir ko dafanaane vaale ek paatr ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 In Pandora's case, this jar was made of sugar clay to store common senses in it, or made of bronze metal, which could be used as a non-retractable gel
 pithos kaa galat anuwaad 16 shatabdi ke maanavtaavaadi rotardam ke irasmus ke dwaara kiya gaya jinhone pandora kii hesiod kahani kaa latin main anuwaad kiya
 Erasmus linked the word Pithos to the Pyxis of Latin; Which means "box"
 vaakyansh "bhaanumati kaa box" kabhi ke baad se saha he
 This misconception was later bolstered by Dante Gabriel Rosetti's painting Pandora

 alaska parvatamala uttar america mahadweep ke pashchimottaree kone main sanyukt rajya america ke alaska rajya ke dakshinmadhya bhaag main or canada ke yukon praant main sthit ek 650 kimi lambi parvatamala he

 papua new gini indonesia ke sameep prashanth mahaasaagar kshetra main ek swatantra raashtra he jo dakshin pashchim prashanth mahaasaagar kshetra main dwipon kaa ek samooh he
 The capital here is Port Moresby
 keval 60 lakh jansankhya vaala desh vividhtaon ke desh ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 About 850 languages are spoken here in such a population and many religious communities live here
 yahan kii jansankhya kaa sirf 18 pratishat bhaag shahari kshetron main nivas karata he
 Caste is the most basic and lower class in the biological classification of organisms
 jeevvaigyanik nazariye se aise jeevon ke samooh ko ek jati bulaayaa jaataa he jo ek dusre ke saath santan utpann karne kii kshamta rakhte ho or jinaki santan swayan aage santan janane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 For example, a wolf and a lion cannot bear children among themselves, so they are considered to be of different castes
 ek ghoda or gadhaa aapas main baccha paidaa kar sakate hai, lekin kyonki khachchar aage baccha janane main asamarth hote hai, isliye ghode or gadhe bhi alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 In contrast, dogs are found in very different sizes, but any male dog and female dog can have children that are capable of producing offspring themselves
 isliye sabhi kute, chaahe ve kisi nasal ke hi kyon na hon, jeevvaigyanik drushti se ek hi jati ke sadsy samajhe jate hai
 Different castes having similarities with each other, in which the biologists believe that they originated from the same ancestor in the past and have been divided into different branches over time through evolution, are put into the same biological lineage is
 masalan ghode, gadhe or zebra alag jatiyon ke hai lekin teenon ek hi 'ekwas' vansh ke sadsy maane jate hai
 The definition of castes in modern times is also done by examining other aspects
 udhaaharan ke liye anuvanshiki kaa prayog karke aksar jeevon kaa di en e parkhaa jaataa he or is aadhaar par un jeevon ko ek jati ghoshit kiya jaataa he jinaki di en e chhap ek duusare se milti ho or duusare jeevon se alag ho
 The definition used for the term "caste" and reliable methods of identifying caste are essential for biological tests and assessment of biodiversity
 prastaavit jatiyon ke kai udaahranon kaa adhyayan aksharon ko jod kar kiya janaa chahie isse pehle kii yah ek jati maan lee jaae
 yah aam taur par un vilupt jatiyon ke liye sankshipt vargeekrut shrenee he jisaki jaankaree keval jeevashm se hi praapt karnaa mumkin he
 Some zoologists may view statistical phenomena as opposed to the traditional idea of the class of species observed in animals
 aisi sthiti main kisi jati ko pruthak rup se shaamil vansh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ekal jin pool kisanrachana karata he
 However, definitions such as dna-sequence and morphology, used to help isolate lineages that are highly related to each other, have clear limitations
 haalanki, "jati" shabd kii sateek paribhaasha abhi bhi vivaadaaspad he, visheshkar jeevakosh ke sambandh main, or yah jati samasya kehalaati he
 Biologists have given more detailed definitions, but there are only a few options used that depend on the characteristics of the respective castes
 aamtaur par istemaal kiye jane vaale paudhe or pashuon ke naam ko taxa kabhi-kabhi in jatiyon ke samaan hote hai: jaise, "sher", "walras," or "kapur kaa ped" - prayek jatiyon ko darshaate hai
 Other cases in which those names are not used: "deer" refers to a class of 34 castes, including eld deer, red deer, and reindeer
 baad vaali do jatiyon ko kabhi yah vyakhya karte hue ek hi jati mana jaataa tha ki vaigyanik gyaan badhane ke saath-saath jatiyon kii simaaen kitni parivartit ho sakati hai
 Due to the difficulties in defining both the world and calculating their total number, it is estimated that anywhere between two and 100 million / 2 to 100 million of this type can be different species
 adarsh rup main, kisi jati ko ek aupchaarik rup se vaigyanik naam diya jaataa he, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi bahut si jatiyaan hai 
 kisi jati kaa naam tab rakhaa jaataa he, jab ise vansh-varg / vansh-kram main rakhaa jaataa he
 From the scientific point of view, it can be considered a hypothesis that castes are much more related to the genus of other castes than to other lineages
 ek saamaanya jatiyon main shaamil he or / iske rup main sabase acha gyaat vargeekaran shrenee hai: jivan, kshetra, rajya, jati, varg, kram, parivaar, vansh or jati
 jinas ko iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa aparivarty nahin; koi vargeekaran vaigyanik baad main main ise bhinn jinas de saktaa he jis kaaran uskaa naam bhi badal jayega
 In biological nomenclature, a caste name has two parts, they are considered Latin, although the name and place of any native language or the name of a person can be used for it
 jati naam pehle ke baad doosraa shabd, vishesh naam soochibaddh he
 For example, the species known as the long-leaf pine is the genus Pinus palustris, whose brown wolves belong to the Canis lumpus, the Coytes canis latrans, the golden fox canis orus, and they all belong to the genus Canis
 Not only in other words, but caste names are completely bipedal
 yah dwipadi namakaran parampara ko baad main namavali ke jaivik code main badalane kaa kaam sabase pehle liyonheart phuks dwaara prayog kiya gaya or maanak ke rup main kerolas lineyas dwaara 1753 main spasis plantaram main jari kiya gaya
 At that time the main biological principle was that the freely represented species were originated by God and hence they are considered to be real and immutable, so that the hypothesis of common ancestry is not applicable
 pustakon or lekh main / inke sankshipt naam / rakhe jate hai or iske sankshipt naam ek vachan main "sp
 " or bahuvachan main "spp
 " ko vishesh naam par rakhaa jaataa he: udhaaharan ke liye, kenis sp
 aisa aamtaur par nimnlikhit sthitiyon main hota he: In books and articles, the names of genus and castes are usually printed in italics
 "sp
" or "spp
" kaa upyog karke inhen itelic nahin karnaa chahie
 It is astonishingly difficult to explain the term "caste" which applies to all natural beings and to biologists about how to interpret castes and how to identify real castes is called the caste problem
 adhikansh pathyapustakon main kisi jati "vaastavik or sambhavit antar nasl prakritik aabaadi vaale samooh" jo aise anya samooh prajnan ke taur par alag rakhe jate hai
 Various parts of this definition, such as some unusual or artificial intercourse, are excluded from it: uparokt adarsh pathyapustak vaali paribhaasha bahu-koshikeey praaniyon ke liye acchhee tarah kaary karti he lekin aisi bhi kuch paristhitiyaan hai jahaan par inhen anupyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he: Horizontal gene transfer makes the term "race" even more complicated to define
 prokerat samooh ke asmaan samoohon or or kam se kam aksar eukerets ke asmaan samoohon ke bich kshaitijiy jin sthanantaran ke majboot sakshya hai or williamson kaa tark he ki crustaciuns or ekinoderm main iske kuch sakshya uplabdh hai
 All definitions of the term "race" that all of their genes are derived from one or two parents are exactly the same as that animal, but basic gene transfer seems to be misconceived
 ek sabase badhiya prashn yah he "jati" shabd jisaki vyakhya jeev vigyaani dete aae hai or is charchaa ko jatiyon kii samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Darwin wrote in Chapter II of On the Origin of Species
 lekin baad main, darwin ne apni The Descent of Man main yah kehete hue apane mat main sanshodhan kiya ki "kya maanav main ek yaa anek jatiyaan shaamil hai"
 The modern theory of development rests on new fundamental definitions of "caste"
 darwin se pehle, prakrutivaadiyon ne jatiyon ko adarsh yaa saamaanya prakaar ke rup main dekha, jiskaa udhaaharan kisi adarsh namoonay ke saath diya ja saktaa he jisamen saamaanya jati ke samaan ve sabhi gun uplabdh hai
 The uniformity of Darwin's theory shifted attention from the simple to the special
 bauddhik itihaaskaar louis minand ke anusaar, It transforms "caste" into a new approach; Darwin vyaavhaarik rup se, jeev vigyaniyon ne jatiyon ko paribhaashit praaniyon kii aabaadi jinamein anuvanshik samanta kaa str ucch hota he ke rup main kii he
 It can reflect the adaptation of the same organism and transfer varieties of genetic material from one potential to another
 is prakaar kii paribhaasha main samanta ke sateek str kaa uprayog ekapaksheeya hota he, lekin yah praaniyon ke liye upyog kii jane vaali sabase aam paribhaasha he jisase alangik prajnan hota he, jiseki kuch paudhe or sookshm praani
 The lack of any apparent caste deficiency in microbiology has led some authors to argue that the use of the term "caste" is not correct when studying bacteria
 iske bajaay unhone jin ko dur-daraaj se sambandhit bacteria ko sambandhit bacteria ko sampurna bacteria sambandhi kshetra ko ek jin vaale pool ke saath swatantra rup se vichrate hue dekhte hai
 Nevertheless, the rule of thumb was established stating that more than 97% of the same 16S rrna gene sequence bacteria or Archaea should be examined by DNA ‚Äì DNA hybridization regardless of whether they belong to the same species
 is avadharana kaa adhyatan haal hi main yah kehete hue kiya gaya he ki 97% kii seemaa bhi bahut kam thi or use 98
7% tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sexually borne organisms, where the genetic material is shared in the reproductive process, then the interbreeding process of the two animals and the hybrid offspring of both sexes are accepted as equal indicators that the animals have shared the same species
 Has adopted abundant genes as a member of
 ek prakaar se "jati" antar prajnan praaniyon kaa ek samooh he
 This definition can be extended further by stating that a caste is a group of animals capable of potentially interbreeding breeding - fish can be kept in the same species even if they live in different lakes because they Interracial breeding can occur if they have ever come in contact with each other
 On the other hand, there are many examples of three or more bizarre populations of whether animals with intercultural populations can breed interculturally in other types of populations, but on the other hand, these populations are not capable of interbreeding
 is prakaar se, yah vishay bahes yogya he ki ye aabaadiyaan ek yaa do alag-alag jatiyaan banaati hai
 There is no contradiction in that species are defined based on gene frequencies and thus have ambiguous boundaries
 natijatan, "jati" kii saarvbhaumik paribhaasha aavashyak rup se ekapaksheeya he
 Instead, biologists have given many definitions; The use of which is the perfect choice for any zoologist depends on the characteristics of that zoologist's research
 abhyaas main, ye paribhaashaayen samaan hai or unke bich ekamusth virodhabhas kii tulana main unka maamla adhik mahatvapurn he
 Nevertheless, none of the concepts of caste proposed so far are fully objective or can apply in all cases without assistance for a decision
 jivan kii jatilta ko dekhte hue, kuch kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke ek uddeshy kii paribhaasha sabhi prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon main asambhav he or jeev vaigyanikon ko sabase adhik vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 It is the concept of all biological species in most spineless animals and is largely deficient in the phylogenetic race
 kai BSC up-jatiyon ko PSC ke antargat jati mana jaataa he; BSC or PSC ke bich antar kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he kyonki BSC jati ko spasht vikasvaadi itihaas ke parinamswaroop jati ko paribhaashit karata he, jabaki PSC kisi jati ko spasht vikasvaadi sambhaavna ke parinamswaroop paribhaashit karata he
 In this way, the PSC castes were "created" as soon as the evolutionary lineage began to be separated, while the BSC caste began to emerge only when their lineage separation was complete
 tadnusaar, PSC banaam BSC ke aadhaar par vaikalpik vargeekaran ke bich paryaapt vivaad sambhav he kyonki unke taxa ke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ve bilkul bhinn hai, use baad vaale model ke antargat up-jatiyaan maanya hongi
 Life-supporting castes: Many castes are absolutely bizarre towards adaptation to the environment, as they are capable of yielding or breeding under certain conditions such as drought, desertification, flooding, soil poisoning, soil salinity, many of which are food
 , Providing materials and empowering humans, livestock and other animals are considered potentially beneficial to humans A
 These are known as life-supporting nations
 jiseki unamem parsparik mukhya jatiyaan shaamil hai kyonki inke paas bhu-akritiyon kii akhandta kii mukhya kunjee hoti he jisamen donon praaniyon ke biodeta or maanav samudaay shaamil hai
 Both ecological and socioeconomic castes are tributaries for life
 jatiyon ke vargeekaran ke saath purvollekhith samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nimnlikhit sankhya keval naam maatr kaa maargdarshan he
 In 2007, they were as follows: jatiyon kii kul sankhya : 7-100 million sahit: Among the Eukaryte castes, we could only identify them: vartmaan main, global texonomi inishiative, european distributed institute of texonomi or censos of marine life texonomi sudhaar kaa prayaas kar rahe hai or pehle se agyaat jatiyon ko texonomi system ko amal main laa rahe hai
 Due to the fact that we know only a few creatures in the living room, yet we do not have full understanding of the functioning of our environment
 professor james melette ke anusaar ham nai jatiyon kii khoj ke baavjood maamalon ko bad se badtar banaate ja rahe hai or ham in jatiyon ko abhootpurv gati ke saath samaapt karte ja rahe hai
 It also means that it must be studied and classified before acquiring a new race, since it may have already become extinct
 jatiyon kii dharna kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 This is one of the most important levels of classification for several reasons: varshon ke prayog ke baad, jeev vigyaan kii avadharana or sambandhit kshetra ke mejabaan ke rup main pramukh rahi he lekin abhi tak ise purna rup se paribhaashit nahin kii gai he
 The nomenclature of a particular caste should be considered hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship and diversity of the organisms of that group
 agrim jaankaree haath main aate hi pariklpana kii pushti yaa uskaa khandan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, especially when communication was much more difficult in the past, classification scientists working on segregation gave different names to different animals that were later identified as a common race
 jab do naam vaali jati kii khoj ek jati ke rup main kii gai, to puraani jati kaa naam aamtaur se kaayam rakhaa gaya or nai jati ke naam ko vah naam de diya gaya, ek aisi prakriya jo ekatrikaran ke rup main paryaayavacheekaran yaa bolchaal kii prakriya kehalaati he
 The division of a texon into more than one is usually called a texon
 vargeekaran vaigyanikon ko aamtaur se unke sahpaathiyon dwaara unhen "lanpar" yaa "splitre" kaha jaataa he, jo jantuon ke bich pahachaane jane vaale antar par unke vyaktigat drushtikon or samaantaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Traditionally, researchers have relied on the observation of structural differences and the observation of whether or not their differential reproduction was successfully carried out for differences in castes in different populations; Both anatomy and reproductive behavior are still important to state the status of castes
 pichley kuch dashakon main, sookshmjeevigyaani anusandhan takanic main kranti ke parinamswaroop jaise DNA vishleshan se jatiyon ke bich antar or samaantaaon ke bare main athaah gyaan uplabdh ho gaya he
 Many populations formerly considered as separate castes are now considered a taxon and the pre-grouped population is divided
 koi vargeekaran str kaa paryaayavacheekaran yaa vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or ucch texonomik str par ye sanshodhan abhi bhi bahut athaah hai
 From the classification point of view, groups in race can be defined more as Texon classification than race
 praanivigyaan main keval up-jatiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jabaki vanaspati vigyaan main vividhta, up-vividhta or swaroop kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In conservation biology, the evolutionary critical unit is used that can be defined as a segment with a caste or more small bizarre population
 vigyaan ke praarambhik kaary main, jati keval alag-alag praani hote the jo apane samaan yaa lagbhag samaan praaniyon ke samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 At that time no other relations were applicable to them
 arestu ne jinas or jati shabd kaa upyog jatigat yaa vishesh virgon ke liye kiya
 Aristotle and other pre-darwinian scientists considered castes to be special and immutable as chemical elements such as "essence"
 When the early observers began to develop the organization as a system for organisms, they began to place the segregated space beforehand
 inamen se kai praarambhik chithran yojanaon ko ab sanakee nahin mana jayega or inamen samarktata ke aadhaar par rang yaa vyavhaar shaamil hai
 In the 18th century, Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to reproductive organs
 haalanki jeevon ke vargeekaran ke unke prakaar ne samanta ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya, lekin unhone samaan jatiyon ke bich sambandh ke bare main koi daawa nahin kiya
 
 At that time, it was still widely believed that no one among the castes believed that there was any biological connection between the biological castes, no matter how similar they looked
 This approach also suggested a kind of idealism: the notion that all the existing castes are an "ideal form"
 haalanki vahaan par sabhi jeevon ke bich hameshaa hi matbhed hai, to bhi linius ne aise antar ko samasyapurna mana
 unhone alag-alag jeevon kii pahchaan karne kaa prayaas kiya jo jatiyon kaa anukaraniya tha or anya gaiyr-anukaraniya jeevon asaamaanya or apurna mana
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that caste could change from time to time, and that the history of the home gave enough time for major changes in them
 jin-baptist lamark ne Zoological Philosophy main sristi-rachana-siddhant ke viruddh pehla taarkik vichaar diya
 There was a new preference for determining how castes might change over time
 lamark ne suzav diya ki jeev kisi praapt gun ko apane aane vaale vansh main pahunchaa saktaa he jaise jiraph kii lambii gardan oonche pedo kii pattiyon tak pahunchnaa jiraph kii peedi kaa gun tha
 However, with Charles Darwin's acceptance of the natural selection idea in 1860, Lanmark's approach to goal-oriented development, also known as the teleological process, was rendered ineffective
 pashchjanan sambandhi prakriyaayein jaise mithailation ke aas-paas praapt visheshtaon ke vanshanukram main haal hi kii ruchi jo DNA kram ko prabhavit nahin karti, lekin viraasatiya tareeke se abhivyakti ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, neo-lamarckism, as it has sometimes been talked about, that the theory of evolution is not a challenge with natural selection
 charles darwin or alfred veles vah vichaar diya jiskaa paalan aaj bhi vaigyanik vikaas ke siddhant kaa sabase shaktishaalee or sammohak rup main karte hai
 Darwin argued that this included population was not just a creature
 unka tark linius kii kattarpanthi dhara ke pariprekshya kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey he:jati kii vyakhya adarsh shabd ke rup main karne kii bajaay, darwin ne jeevon ke bich antar ko prakritik mana
 unhone aage tark diya ki samasyagrastata se dur durlabh jati ke astitv ke liye vastav main uskaa spashtikaran kiya
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus' insight that the growth rate of organic populations would always be ahead of the growth rate of resources in the environment, such as the supply of food
 As a result, Darwin argued that not all organisms in the population would be able to subsist and breed
 unke dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ausatan lekin unamem antar hoga - haalanki ve use thodaa bahut paryaavaran ke anukool banaaenge
 agar ye gunon vaale antar paitruk rahe to jivit rahane waalon kaa vansh unhen dhaaran kar legaa
 In this way, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population over many generations, while the hostile traits will disappear
 is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki kya paryaavaran main koi antar anukuli he yaa gaiyr anukuli: bhinn-bhinn paryaavaran alag alag gunon kaa paksh lete hai
 Because the environment effectively chooses which creature to survive for reproduction and it is the environment that determines which qualities should go forward
 yah prakritik chayan ke dwaara vikaas kaa siddhant he
 In this model, the neck length of a giraffe would be interpreted according to the situation that the long-necked proto-giraffe acquired special reproductive traits from the short-necked giraffe
 For many generations, the entire population would have belonged to long-necked animals
 
 1859 main, jab darwin ne prakritik chayan kaa apana siddhant prakashit kiya, to us samay vanshanukram ke vyaktigat gunon vaale tantra kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Although Darwin made some assumptions about inheritance of virtue, his theory was based only on the fact that inheritance properties exist and are mutable
 haalanki grager mendal anuvanshiki par shodh-patr ko uski visheshtaon kii pahchaan kiye bina hi 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This was not done until 1900 when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Verais, Carl Correns, and Erick von Semark, when they realized that Darwin's theory had "inherited properties" genes
 prakritik chayan ke madhyam se vikaas kii jatiyon ke vargeekaran main jatiyon kii charchaa ke liye do mahatvapurn manyataayen he - ve parinaam lineyas kii texonomi ke paksh main anumaanon ko moolbhoot rup se chunauti detii hai
 At first it showed that castes are not only the same but they can also be really related
 darwin ke kuch chaatro kaa tark he ki sabhi jatiyaan aam purvaj kii vanshaj hai
 Second, it is assumed that "caste" is not homogeneous, stable, permanent things; Caste members are completely different and castes have changed a long time ago
 is baat se pataa chalata he ki jatiyon kii koi vishesh seemaa kshetra nahin he lekin lagaataar badalati jin-aavritiyon ke sankhyikeey prabhaav padate hai
 Still, one can use the classification of Linnaeus to identify plants and animals, but no one can think of an independent and immutable form of castes anymore
 paitruk vansh se kisi nai jati main vikaas hona speshiation kehalaata he
 The progeny caste has no clear lineage demarcation from its descendant caste
 haalanki jatiyon ke vartmaan vaigyanik gyaan se yah pataa chalaa he ki sabhi maamalon main vibhinn jatiyon ke bich antar sthapit karne ke liye koi thos or vyapak tarika nahin he, taaki jeev vigyaani is vichaar ke sanchaalan ko jari rakhane ke liye thos tareekon kii talash jari rakhen
 jati ke bare main sabase lokapriy jaivik paribhaasha main se ek prajnan algaav ke sandarbh main he, agar do praani donon lingon ke sankar vansh kaa prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hote, to ve bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke hote hai
 Intuitive castes have limitations in this definition, but are incomplete
 udhaaharan ke liye un jati ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he jo alangik tareeke se prajnan karte hai or use vilupt hoti ja raheen jatiyon par lagu karnaa bada mushkil he
 In addition, the boundaries between castes are often unclear: there are instances where members of a particular population breed fertile hybrid offspring of creatures from a second population and members of a second population cultivate fertile hybrids from creatures with a third population
 Can breed offspring but members of the first and third populations cannot breed fertile hybrids or only fertile offspring from parents Birth is possible
 natijatan, kuch log jati kii is paribhaasha ko asweekaar karte hai
 Richard Dakins describes the two organisms as homogeneous and if they have the same number of chromosomes and for each chromosome, both creatures have the same number of chromosomes
 However, most all classification scientists will disagree with this point
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai ubhaycharon main, vishesh rup se newjiland main, leopelma mendhakon ke jinom main "mul" jinom hote hai jo bilkul bhinn nahin hote or gaun gunasutra hote hai jo bahut se sanyojanon main maujuud hai
 Although extreme differences are found in the number of chromosomes of the population, they can successfully differentiate and form a single developmental unit
 paudhon main, poliflidi antar prajnan par kuch rokthaamon vaala atyadhik saamaanya sthaan he; kyonki praaniyon ke gunasutron ke set sam sankhya se visankramit kiye jate hai, jo vartmaan gunasutron ke set kii vaastavik sankhya par nirbhar karata he jahaan vahi vikaskaari ikai ke kuch praani kuch anya ke saath antar prajnan kar sakate hai or kuch nahin or usamen puri aabaadi ko visheshtaur se ek saamaanya jin pool banane ke rup main joda gaya he
 Classification of species is particularly affected by technological advances that allowed researchers to link their evidence based on molecular traces, to acute evidence of crude blood plasma, in the mid-20th century ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization study of Charles Sibley, In 1970, the comparison gave rise to DNA sequencing techniques
 in takneekon ke parinamswaroop ucch texonomik virgon main krantikari parivartan aayaa, jisase filogenetic ped kii bahut si shakhaon kii punarvyavastha vaale parinaam praapt hue
 neeche jainara ke texonomik virgon ke liye, parinaam ek saath milaae gaye; anvik str par vikasvaadi parivartan kii gati ko dhimaa kiya gaya, jisase keval prajnan algaav ke upyukt avadhi ke baad hi spasht antar praapt hue
 DNA-DNA sankaran ke parinaamon se gumraah karne vaale parinaam praapt hue, to pomerine skua - great skua kii ghatana ek prasiddh udhaaharan ban gayi
 The turtle was determined to develop at the molecular level with only one-eighth of the speed of other reptiles, and the rate of molecular evolution in albatross is found to be only half that of storum-petrels
 aajkal aprachlit sankaran takanic uplabdh he or anukram kii tulana ke liye or adhik vishwasaneey computesnal drushtikon dwaara badali jaati he
 Molecular taxonomy is not directly based on evolutionary processes, but overall changes are made by these processes
 ve prakriyaayein jo peedi or vividhta vaale rakrakhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai jaise parivartan, badlaav kii prakriya or chayan samroop nahin hai
 DNA is only the rarer direct target of natural selection rather than a change in DNA sequence during generations on the latter outcome; For example, the silent transit-substitution combination would alter the melting point of the DNA sequence, but not the sequence of the encoded protein, and for example where for microorganisms, the changes in themselves consider changes in their fitness

 Due to its palaces and forts, it has become a center of tourist attraction
 tanavda Jodhpur city is the largest city in western Rajasthan, it was founded by Rao Jodha in 1459 AD
 26-2737'uttari ankshash7255'-7352'purvi deshaantar In terms of administration, Jodhpur district is divided into the following tehsils: - History of Jodhpur was done by Rao Jodha in 1459 He was a Rajput of Rathore clan
 His father Randev was killed in Mewar, so he had to leave the area initially Mandor was the capital of Jodha but later Jodhpur became his center, Mehrangarh Fort of Jodhpur
