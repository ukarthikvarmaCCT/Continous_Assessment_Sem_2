 After the death of Ghayasuddin Tughlaq, his son 'juna Khan' as the name of Muhammad bin Tughlaq sat on the throne of Delhi
 iskaa mul naam 'ulug khaan' tha

 After sitting on the throne, Tughlaq gave various titles and positions to the rich and the chieftains
 usne tartar khaan ko 'baharaam khaan' kii oopaadhi, malik qabool ko 'imaad-ul-mulk' kii oopaadhi evam 'vazeer-e-mumalik' kaa pad diya tha, par kaalaantar main use 'kaanejahaan' kii oopaadhi ke saath gujarat kaa haaqim banaaya gaya

 In fact, it was the misfortune of that ruler that his plans were not executed successfully
 jiske kaaran yah itihaaskaaron kii aalochana kaa paatr bana
 While sitting on the throne of Muhammad Tughlaq, the Delhi Sultanate was divided into a total of 23 provinces, the main ones of which were Delhi, Devgiri, Lahore, Multan, Sarmuti, Gujarat, Awadh, Kannauj, Lakhnauti, Bihar, Malwa, Jajnagar, Dvarasamudra etc
 kashmir evam baluchistan bhi dilli sultanate main shaamil the

 parantu isaki krur niti ke kaaran rajya main vidroh armbh ho gaya
 As a result, a new independent state was established in the south and these regions were separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal bhi swatantra ho gaya
 After the ascension, Muhammad Tughlaq tried to make some new plans and implement them
 jaise - Through his first plan, Muhammad Tughlaq increased the tax in the fertile region of Doab, but in the same year there was a severe famine in Doab, which affected the yield
 tululaq ke adhikariyon dwaara jabaran kar vasuulne se us kshetra main vidroh ho gaya, jisase tululaq kii yah yojana asafal rahi

 sarkari karmchaariyon ke bhrashtachar, kisaanon kii udaseenta, bhoomi kaa acha na hona ityadi kaarnon se krishi unnati sambandhi apni yojana ko teen varsh pashchaat samaapt kar diya
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq provided loans to farmers at very low interest
 tululaq ne apni duusari yojana ke antargat rajdhani ko dilli se devgiri sthaanantarit kiya
 Devagiri was also called "kuvvatul Islam"
 sultan qutubuddin mubarak kilji ne devgiri kaa naam 'qutubabad' rakhaa tha or mohammad bin tululaq ne iskaa naam badalakar daulatabad kar diya
 The Sultan was most criticized for this plan
 mohammad tululaq dwaara rajdhani parivartan ke kaarnon par itihaaskaaron main bada vivaad he, phir bhi nishkarshtah kaha ja saktaa he ki, devgiri kaa dilli sultanate ke madhya sthit hona, mongol akramanakariyon ke bhay se surakshit rahanaa, dakshin-bharat kii sampannataa kii ore khinchaav aadi aise kaaran the, jinke kaaran sultan ne rajdhani parivartit karne kii baat sochi
 This plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed completely and he allowed people from Daulatabad to return to Delhi in 1335 AD

 sankethik mudra ke antargat sultan ne sambhawatah pital or tamba dhaatuon ke sikke chalaaye, jiskaa mulya chaandi ke rupee taka ke baraabar hota tha
 Due to lack of state control over coinage, many fake mints were made

 Inspiration for running sign currency came from China and Iran

 In order to conquer Khorasan, Muhammad Tughlaq gave a salary of one year in advance to a large army of 3,70,000 soldiers, but due to political change the two countries reached a compromise, which failed the Sultan's plan and financially hurt him

 His entire army wandered in the wild paths, according to Ibn Battuta, ultimately only ten officers could survive and return
 is prakaar mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi asafal rahi
 Probably between 1328-29 AD, the Mongol invader Tarmasharin Chagtai invaded India with a huge army and trampled the territories from Multan, Lahore to Delhi
 aisa mana jaataa he ki, sultan mohammad tululaq ne mongol netaa ko ghoose dekar waapas kar diya tha ye bhi smbhv he ki mongol netaa ne sultan ko dilli sltant ko khud hi ythasthiti kamazor karne va isi tarah mongol shasn ke liye zmin tyaar karne ke liye ghoose di
 Whatever happened between them, the Sultan was subjected to criticism due to this compromise policy towards the Mongol leader
 ye sahi he ki iske baad phir kabhi mohammad tululaq ke samay main bharat par mongol akraman nahin hua or ye bhi ki apni mahattvakankshi asafal yojanaon ke kaaran mohammad tululaq ko ‘asafalataaon kaa badshaah’ kaha jaataa he
 Most revolts took place during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, of which 27 revolts took place in South India alone

 mahatma gandhi ne kisi nae darshan kii rachana nahin kii he varan unke vichaaron kaa jo darshanik aadhaar he, vahi gandhi darshan he
 The kind of philosophical rites which impose their impression on the Indian believer who believe in the power of God, the same impression is lying on Gandhiji's thoughts
 ve bharat ke moolbhoot kuch darshanik tatwon main apni aasthaa prakat karke agrasar hote hai or usee se unki sari vichaardhaara pravaahit hoti he
 By not falling into any serious mysticism, they believe that the God Shiva, Satyamaya and Chinmaya are the origin of the universe and he created the creation for some purpose
 ve aise desh main paidaa hue jisane chaitanya aatma kii akshun or amar satta sweekaar kii he
 He was born in the country in which the only Avineshwar Chetan is seen in the core of life, world creation and nature, and the whole process of creation is also accepted
 unhone yadhyapi is prakaar ke darshan kii koi vyakhya athwa uski gudhata ke vishay main kahin vishad or vyavasthit rup se kuch likhaa nahin he, par unke vichaaron kaa adhyayan karne par unki uparyukt drushti kaa abhas miltaa he
 His famous sentence is - Just as i see a gross substance in front of me, similarly i see Ram at the core of the world
 ek baar unhone kaha tha, andhkaar main prakaash kii or mrityu main jivan kii akshay satta pratishthit he
 Here they see the purpose of life and the world
 ve kehete hai ki jivan kaa nirmaan or jagat kii rachana shubh or ashubh jad or chetan ko lekar hui he
 The purpose of this creation is to win the truth over the untruth and the auspicious over the inauspicious
 ve yah maanate hai ki jagat kaa dikhaai denevaala bhautik ansh jitna satya he utana hi or usase bhi adhik satya na dikhaai denevaala ek chetan bhavalok he jisaki vyanjana jivan he
 As a result, they believe that while there are inauspicious circles in man, there is auspicious residence in his heart
 yadi usamen pashutaa he to devatv bhi pratishthit he
 The purpose of creation is to enlighten the divinity in it and beastly torture, awaken the auspiciousness and defeat the inauspicious
 unki drushti main jo kuch ashubh he, asundar he, ashiv he, asaty he, vah sab aniatik he
 The one who is auspicious, the one who is auspicious, the one who is auspicious is moral
 vahi satya, vahi shiv or sundar he
 One who is beautiful should be shivaay and sunny
 unhone yah mana he ki sadaa se manushya apane sharir ko, apane bhoga ko, apane swaarth ko, apane ahankaar ko, apane pet ko or apane prajnan ko pramukhataa pradaan karata rahaa he
 But where these tendencies are in man, by which he continues to be affected, the same man's exaltation and renunciation, love and generosity, selflessness and individuality in the macro, by omitting outright egoism, become divine
 The feeling is also present
 in bhaavon kaa udbodhan tathaa unnayan daanav par dev kii vijay kaa saadhan he
 It is the overthrow of immorality and the victory of invincible morality

 He believes that everything that is immoral in the world is violence

 His non-violence is not limited to mere ideals
 ve use hi lakshya kii sansiddhi ke liye shaktimay saadhan ke rup main bhi dekhte hai
 Gandhi's genius in displaying non-violence as a rebellion against animalism and revealing it as invincible and unfailing power, shows his unprecedented innovation
 unki ahimsa keval jeevahinsa na karne tak hi parimit nahin he, pratyut jahaan kahin hinsa ho, anyaay ho, pashutaa ho, uskaa muqabla karne ke liye parmashakti ke rup main agrasar hoti hai
 Bending the head of injustice and injustice is a sin
 pashutaa ko prashray mat do pashutaa ke saamne sir na jhukaao, aniti or pashutaa kaa saamana aniatikta or pashutaa ke dwaara mat karo kyonki vah pashutaa par pashutaa kii vijay hogi
 Divinity will triumph over animalism when the immoral and demon spirit is defeated by moral and auspicious weapons
 shastr se shastr kaa, hinsa se hinsa kaa, krodh se krodh kaa paraabhav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 His non-violence is active, not passive
 vah kaayar palaayanwadee athwa shastr se bhaybheet honevaale ke liye nikal bhaagane kaa maarg prastut karne ke nimitt nahin yojit hoti
 It stands on the basis of valor, perseverance, determination and patience that challenges the injustice and malpractices, all the armaments of the world, and all the oppressive tendencies of governance impatient with malice and conceit
 unki is chintanadhara se asahyog or satyagah kaa janm hua
 This is the embodiment of their violent revolution, bloodless insurrection and violenceless war
 unki drushti main ahimsa amogh shakti he jiskaa paraabhav kabhi ho nahin saktaa
 More power than armed rebellion lies in non-violent rebellion
 shastr kaa sahaara lekar ahimsak vir kii aatma kaa dalan karne main koi satta, samrajya athwa shakti samarth nahin ho sakati
 Non-violence is dependent on morality, so it is true and truth will always be victorious
 is prakaar sansar ke saamne ahimsa ke rup main unhone ujwal, mahaan or naitik path nirmit kiya
 Which inspired the human society and the world to be dynamic
 ve un samast manyataon, dharanaon or drushtiyon ke pratwaad hai jinka aadhaar bhautikwaad he
 They are the symbol of all the emotions which indicate the direction of man to move towards divinity, not towards animalism
 is ahimsak path ko pradarshit karke ve kalpana karte hai ek aise lakshya tak pahunchne kii jahaan ahimsa ke aadhaar par hi manushya ke jivan, uske samaaj or uske jagat kii vyavastha kii rachana kii ja sake
 They believe that human beings can be transformed and developed towards auspiciousness
 ve yah bhi maanate hai ki nisargat: manushya bhala he or bhalaai kii ore hi unmukh he
 They understand that society is formed by the person and the change of the person will change the society
 ve yah bhi maanate hai ki parivartit samaaj vyakti ke liye un sanskaron kii rachana karegaa jisase nutan samskruti kaa aavirbhaav hoga
 All the imagination of how a society can be created on the basis of non-violence is distinguished in his spinning wheel
 ve yah sweekaar karte hai ki aarthik vyavastha kaa vyakti or samaaj par sabase adhik prabhaav hota he or phir usase utpann hui aarthik or saamaajik manyataayen raajnneetik vyavastha ko janm detii hai
 Today the system of production of substances has become concentrated due to scientific mechanism and it is sitting at the root of all the problems of the modern world
 utpaadan kii kendrit pranali kendribhoot puunji ko janm detii he jiske falswaroop samaaj ke thode se vyaktiyon ke haathon main aarthik or saamaajik vyavastha kaa sutara aata he
 Political power is set on the basis of great and centralized arms power to centralize power and authority and sovereignty to protect it
 fal hota he samaaj ke bahut bade ang kaa shoshan, dohan or dalan
 In this way, the empowered and exploited masses are basically subjugated from the economic, social and political point of view, although they appear to be independent
 taatpary yah he ki shastr or aniti kaa sahaara lekar jo vyavastha parichaalit hogi usamen maanav dwaara maanav kaa utpeedan avashyabhavi he
 The solution to this problem is the creation of a non-violent society and that society can be formed on the basis of decentralization
 utpaadan kii pranali vikrendrit ho, utpaadan ke saadhan vikendrit ho, puunji vikendrit ho, samaaj jivan ke liye aavashyak padaarthon kii uplabdhi main swaavlambee ho
 He does not have to become a frontman of C
 apni kamai kaa bhoga vah swayan kar sake or is prakaar vikendrit utpaadan ore puunji ke aadhaar par bana hua samaaj kisi vargvishesh ke swaarth kaa saadhan na ban paae
 Then when capital will be decentralized and the units of society become self-reliant, then there will be no need for a central political power endowed with arms and a state when human beings will be free from the oppression, pulsing and exploitation of human beings and enjoy true freedom
 charkha usee dohan se mukt hokar sachhee swatantraaa kaa upbhog karegaa

 mahatma gandhi saadhy se adhik saadhan par dhyaan dena aavashyak maanate the
 He said that if practicable is pure and human, then the means should also be as pure, the same virtuous and the same human
 ham dekhte hai ki saadhy or saadhan kii samaaj pavitrataa par bal dena or uskaa aashray grahan karnaa unki sadhana rahi he
 These fundamental ideas of his have created a very bright and sacred chapter in the history of the development of human society

 For example


 H2N-CH2-CH2-NH2 is named ethane-1, 2-dimene
 airil ameenon main -NH2 samooh benzene valay se sidhe judaa rahata he
 The most common example of aryl amine is C6H5NH2
 saamaanya paddati main ise anillin kehete hai
 It is also an acceptable name in the IUPAC method
 airil amin kaa namakaran karte samay erine congreji main likhe naam ke ant main se 'e' anulagn kaa pratisthaapan amin shabdase karte hai
 Therefore, C6H5-NH2 will be called benzeneamine in the IUPAC method
 sarini main kuch alkil evam airil ameenon ke saamaanya evam aiupiasi naam main die gaye hai
 Amines are prepared by the following methods
 nitro yogic sookshm vibhajit nickel, paladium athwa platinum kii upasthiti mehydrogen gas pravaahit karne se ameenon main apchit ho jate hai
 They can also be reduced by acidic mediums
 isi prakaar se nitroalkin bhi sangatalkeneminon main apchit kii ja sakati hai
 Reduction by scrap iron and hydrochloric acid is preferred, as the fecl2 generated in the reaction decomposes to give hydrochloric acid
 at:keval abhikriya prarambh karne ke liye hydrochloric amla kii bahut kam maatra menaavashyaktaa hoti he
 You have read in Unit 10 that the carbon-halogen bond in alkyl or benzyl halides is easily dislodged by the nucleus

 The process of cleavage of the CX bond by ammonia is called ammonia
 yah abhikriya 373 k taap par sil band nalika main karaate hai
 The primary amine thus obtained behaves like a nucleus and can react with alkylhydride to form secondary and tertiary amines and finally quaternary ammonium salts
 is abhikriya main hellidon kii ameenon se abhikriyasheeltaa kaa kram RI > rbr > RC1 hotahai
 Amine free from ammonium salts can be obtained by reaction with strong alkali
 amoniapaghatan main yah asuvidha he ki isse praathmik, dwitiyak ev tritiyak aminatatha chatushk ammonium lavan kaa mishran praapt hota he
 Although the main product obtained by taking ammonia in excess can be primary ammon

 It is not clear whether the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence is headed by the government and whether it has ended its support to the insurgents in Kashmir or not, although Pakistani support has certainly been restricted to the militants
 2000 ke aasapaas ke baad se 'vidrohi' kam hinsak ho gaye hai or uske badale main march or pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Some groups have laid down their arms and are trying to peacefully decide the conflict

 rah june 1962 se march 1969 tak pakistan kii sarvocch vidhi samhita thi
 Like the constitution of 1956, it was suspended in 1969
 antytah ise 1973 ke samvidhan se badal diya gaya, jo ab bhi lagu he
 After the constitution was changed in India in 1950, Pakistan's lawmakers stepped up efforts to establish their constitution
 pradhanmantri mohammad ali or unki sarkaar ke adhikariyon ne desh main vipakshi dalon ke sahyog ke saath pakistan ke liye ek samvidhan taiyaar karne ke liye kaam kiya
 Finally, because of this joint work, the first set of constitutions was implemented
 yah ghatana 23 march 1956 ko hui thi,is din ko aaj bhi pakistan ke samvidhan ke pravartan ke uplakshya main ganatantraa diwas manaata he
 This constitution provided Pakistan with a "unicameral legislature" parliamentary system of government
 saath hi, isane aadhikarik taur par pakistan ko ek islamic ganraajya ghoshit bhi kiya
 Furthermore, in it, the principle of parity was also introduced for the first time
 samvidhan dwaara, iskundar mirza ne adhyaksh pad grahan kiya, lekin rashtriya maamalon main unki lagaataar asanvaidhanik bhagidaari ke kaaran, chaar nirvaachit pradhanmantriyon ko maatr do saalon main hi barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Under public pressure, President Iskandar Mirza upheld the coup in 1958; And thus this constitution was almost suspended
 sheeghra hi baad main general ayub khan ne iskundar mirza apdasth or khud ko raashtrapati ghoshit kar diya
 And so this constitution was able to run only for 3 years
 17 farvari 1960, ko ayub khan ne desh ke bhavishya ke raajnneetik dhaanche par report karne ke liye ek ayog kii niyukti kii
 The commission was formed with ten other members headed by former Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mohammad Shahabuddin
 isamen purvi pakistan se paanch sadsy or paanch pashchimi pakistan se bhi paanch sadsy the
 It was composed entirely of retired judges, lawyers, industrialists and landlords
 is samvidhan ayog kii report ko 6 may 1961 ko raashtrapati ayub ke samaksh prastut kii gai or raashtrapati or unke mantrimandal dwaara jaanch ke pashchaat janvari 1962 main, cabinet ant main nae samvidhan ke mul paath ko manjuuri de di gai
 It was implemented by President Ayub on 1 March 1962 and finally came into effect on 8 June 1962
 yah samvidhan nihit 250 lekh baarah bhaagon or teen kaarykram main baanta gaya tha
 Like the previous constitution, it also talked about building Pakistan on Islamic values and keeping a unicameral legislature
 parantu 1956 ke samvidhan ke mukaable is samvidhan kii pariyojnaon ke mutabik pakistan ke raashtrapati ko anek karyadhikaar diye gaye the, or multah ek adhyakshiya vyavastha gathit kii gai thi
 1) Written Constitution The Constitution of 1962 was a written document
 isamen paanch kaarykram or 250 lekh prakashit the
 2) Steadfast Constitution: It was a firm constitution, and can be amended only through a special procedure
 samvidhan main sanshodhan sansad ke kam se kam do-tihaai bahumat se paarit kiya jaataa tha, evam tatpashchaat, raashtrapati dwaara pramanikaran ke baad hi yah sanshodhan kanoon kaa hissaa ban saktaa tha
 3) Federal system It was introduced by the federal system in the country
 isamen kendriya sarkaar or dono purv or pashchim pakistan ke prantiy sarkaar shaamil the
 4) Presidential type of governance: The President was the Chief Executive and Head of the country
 unhen apane cabinet ke mantriyon ko manonith karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya tha

 7) Provincial Governments There was provision for only two provincial governments, one for East Pakistan and one for West Pakistan
 unamem se har ek ke prantadhyaksh ke taur par rajyapal ko niyukt kiya gaya tha
 The governor was empowered to appoint provincial ministers with the approval of the President of Pakistan
 8) prantiy vidhayikaprayek praant main ek vidhayika pradaan kiya gaya
 It originally consisted of 150 members
 haalanki, baad main is ank par 218 kii vruddhi hui thi
 9) Powers of the President: As per the provisions of the Constitution of 1962, the President shall be elected for a period of 5 years and must also be a Muslim
 unhen kanoonon ke khilaaf adhyadesh or vito prakhyapit karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya tha, jise keval neshnal assembly kii do / tihaai bahumat se aksham kiya ja saktaa tha
 However, the President did not have the authority to dissolve the legislature except at the cost of his office
 10) raashtrapati par pratibandhrashtrapati ko pakistan kii seva main koi laabh kaa pad dhaaran karne kii anumati nahin thi, lekin yah prabandh se nijee sampatti dhaaran karne se roka nahin gaya tha
 11) Islamic law
 No law will be passed against the teaching of Quran and Sunnah and the existing laws will be Islamized
 12) moulik adhikaar1962 ke samvidhan dharm ke daawey ko pesha chunane kii swatantraaa or abhivyakti, swatantraaa ke moulik adhikaar ke neeche rakhi

 14) Supreme Judicial Council a Supreme Judicial Council was to be set up consisting of two judges of the High Courts, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and and two senior judges
 1956 ke samvidhan kii tarah hi 1962 kaa samvidhan bhi adhik samay tak nahin rah paaya
 The second martial law in Pakistan was imposed on 26 March 1969 when President Ayub Khan abolished the constitution in 1962 and handed over power to the commander-in-chief of the army, General Aga Mohammad Yahya Khan
 raashtrapati pad sanbhaalane par, general yahya khan pashchim pakistan main lokapriy maang par ek ikai vyavastha ko khatm kar diya or ek aadmi ek vot ke siddhant par aam chunaav kaa aadesh diya
