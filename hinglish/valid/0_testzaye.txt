 atah We have assumed here that the sequence is not an increment, so an ≤ am { \ displaystyle a_ {n} \ leq a_ {m}} for every n ≥ m { \ displaystyle n \ geq m}
 atah mul shrenee kaa abhisaran is "sanghanan" shrenee ke sidhe tulana ke anusaar chalata he
 To see that the original range is convergent, as a result of which the previous range is also convergent, so keeping the value as follows or hamen punah sidhe tulana se abhisaran praapt hota he
 And we have proved it

 Let ∑ n = 0 ∞ an { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 0} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n}} is an infinite real range whose expressions are positive and non-increasing, and assume u 0 <u 1 <u
 2 <⋯ { \ displaystyle u_ {0} <u_ {1} <u_ {2} < \ cdots} is necessarily an increasing sequence of positive integers, thus paribaddh he, jahaan δ u n { \ displaystyle \ Delta u_{n}} agr antar he
 Then the range ∑ n = 0 ∞ an { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 0} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n}} converges if the range abhisari ho
 By taking un = 2 n { \ displaystyle u_ {n} = 2 ^ {n}}, δ un = 2 n { \ displaystyle \ Delta u_ {n} = 2 ^ {n}} is obtained, so the Cauchy condensation test Is obtained as a special state

 bharat durdasha naatak kii rachana 1875 i
 main bharatendu harishchandr dwaara kii gai thi
 In it, Bhartendu has depicted the current state of India through symbols
 ve bharatvasiyon se bharat kii durdasha par rone or phir is durdasha kaa ant karne kaa prayaas karne kaa aahvaan karte hai
 They consider British rule and infighting as the main cause of India's plight
 tatpashchaat ve kureetiyaan, rog, aalasy, madiraa, andhkaar, dharm, santosh, apvyay, fishan, sifarish, lobh, bhay, swarthparata, ativrishti, anaavrishti, akaal, baadh aadi ko bhi bharat durdasha kaa kaaran maanate hai
 But the biggest reason is the British's policy of looting India
 angrejon ne apana shashan majboot karne ke liye desh main shiksha vyavastha, kanoon vyavastha, dak seva, rail seva, printing press jaisi suvidhaon kaa srijan kiya 
 But all this was to make his rule easy for himself
 desh kii arth vyavastha jin kutir udyogon se panapati thi unako barabaad karke apane kaarkaanon main bane maal ko jabardasti ham par thopane lage 
 Starvation spread in the country due to snatching through earnings
 lakhon log akaal or mahamari se marane lage 
 But the British were not deterred by this
 vah badastoor apni tijoriyaan bharte ja rahe the
 The whole country was silently watching itself being plundered
 marate hue dekh rahaa tha 
 Quietly

 From despair niskriyata se 
 At this time, Bharatendu Harishchandra's Bharat Plight drama was published
 unhone likhaa- The categories of stars in astronomy are based on the spectrum of light coming from them
 is varnakram se yah zaahir ho jaataa he ki taare kaa taapmaana kya he or uske andar koun se rasinic tatv maujuud hai
 Most alphabetically based categories are given as O, B, A, F, G, k and m letter names of English- dhyaan rahe ke kisi darshak ko in taron ke rang inaki shrenee ke bataae gaye rangon se alag prathit ho sakate hai
 a letter from zero to nine is also associated with these letters for categorization of stars, indicating the location of the star in the interval of two letters
 jaise ki "A5" kaa sthaan "A0" or "F0" ke thik bich main he
 a Roman numeral is also added behind these letters and numerals, which is I, II, III, IV or V
 agar koi tara mahadaanav ho to use i kaa roman ank miltaa he
 III means that the star is a demon star and v means that it is a dwarf star
 hamaare suraj ki shrenee G2V he, yaahi yah ek pilaa bouna tara he jo 2 qadam naarangi taare kii taraf he
 The brightest star in the sky, the hunter, is ranked A1V
 harvard vidhi boune taron ko shreniyon main baantne kaa ek tareeqa he
 It has been seen that the more the star turns towards blue, the hotter it gets and the bigger it gets
 neeche dikhaaya gaya he ke alag shreniyon ke taron kaa kya taapmaana hota he or hamaare suraj kii tulana main kya aakaar or chamkilaapan hota he
 Note that this is only valid for the strings of the main sequence - 1880 i ke baad ke kaal main harvard vishvavidhyalay kii vedhashala main kaam kar rahe vaigyanikon ne sitaron kii 'A' se lekar 'O' tak shreniyan banaai
 But in the 1920s the Indian astronomer Meghnad Saha showed a relationship between the spectrum of stars and their surface temperature
 jaise-jaise is kshetra main gyaan badhata gaya, vaigyanikon ne shreniyan taapmaana ke anusaar badal di or jahaan do shreniyan vastav main ek hi taapmaana ke taron ke bare main thi unhen vilay karke ek shrenee hataa di gayi 
 The study of Saha and other scientists made it clear that OBAFGKM are actually surface temperature ranges
 1943 main yarkis vedhashala main kaam kar rahe teen vaigyanikon ne taron ke varnakram kii ek nayi shreneekaran vidhi banaai
 The names of these scientists were William Wilson Morgan, Philippe C
 Keenan and Edith Calman, so the system is also called the "MKK" method, which is formed by adding the first English letters to their last names
 jahaan harvard shreneekaran sirf satahi taapmaana ke hisaab se chalata he or keval boune taron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he vahaan yarkis shreneekaran main satahi taapmaana or chamak donon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or yah sabhi taron kaa shreneekaran karte hai
 Monster stars have the same mass as dwarf stars, but their diameter is greater than dwarf stars
 isliye daanav taron kii sataha par gurutvkarshan, gas kaa ghanatv or dabaav teenon boune taron se bahut kam hote hai
 This difference can be seen to have a significant impact on the spectrum
 boune taron ke zyaada dabaav kii vajah se unke varnakram kii laqiren "fail" jaati hai
 According to the gloss, the yurkese method has these categories - nirdeshaank: 21°14′N 81°38′E / 21
23°N 81
63°E / 21

 This article provides information on common uses of operational amplifiers
 sarlikrut yojanatmak aarekh kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 Compares two voltages and switches its output to indicating which voltage is larger
 Uses negative feedback to invert and amplify a voltage 
 Amplifies a voltage The circuit shown is used for finding the difference of two voltages each multiplied by some constant 
 The name "differential amplifier" should not be confused with the "differentiator", also shown on this page
 The "instrumentation amplifier", which is also shown on this page, is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high input impedance
 Whenever r 1 = r 2 { \ displaystyle R_ {1} = R_ {2}} and r f = r g { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {f}} = r _ { \ text {g}}}, When r 1 = r f = r 2 = r g { \ displaystyle R_{1}=R_{ \ mathrm {f} }=R_{2}=R_{ \ mathrm {g} }} : Used as a buffer amplifier, to eliminate loading effects or to interface impedances
 Due to the strong feedback, this circuittends to get unstable when driving a high capacity load
 This can be avoided by connecting the load through aresistor
 a summing amplifer sums several voltages: Integrates the signal over time Differentiates the signal over time
 Combines very high input impedance, high common-mode rejection, low DC offset, and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements a bistable multivibrator implemented as a comparator with hysteresis
 In this configuration, the hysteresis curve is non-inverting, and the switching thresholds are ± r 1 r 2 v sat { \ displaystyle \ pm { \ frac {R_ {1}} {R_ {2}}} v _ { \ text { sat}}} where v sat { \ displaystyle v _ { \ text {sat}}} is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier
 Alternatively, the input and the ground may be swapped
 In this configuration, the hysteresis curve is inverting, and the switching thresholds are ± r 1 r 1 + r 2 v sat { \ displaystyle \ pm { \ frac {R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}}V_{ \ text{sat}}} 
 Such a configuration is used in the relaxation oscillator shown below
 By using an RC network to add slow negative feedback to the inverting Schmitt trigger, a relaxation oscillator is formed
 The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to oscillate in an endless symmetric square wave
 Simulates an inductor
 Voltage divider reference Creates a resistor having a negative value for any signal generator In general, the components r 1 { \ displaystyle R_ {1}}, r 2 { \ displaystyle R_ {2}}, and r 3 { \ displaystyle R_ {3}} need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an impedance
 Produces a pure sine wave
 Although there are some limitations, this super diode circuit behaves like an ideal diode for the load RL { \ displaystyle r _ { \ text {L}}}
 Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects
 where IS { \ displaystyle i _ { \ text {S}}} is the saturation current
 when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by: The output voltage is given by: {{infobox Physical quantity| bgcolour =| name = vidyut aavesh| image = | caption = | unit = | symbols = Q| derivations = q = i · t}}vidyut aavesh kuch upaparmanviya kanon main ek mul gun he jo vidyutchumbakatv kaa mahatv he

 In astronomy, the celestial middle line is a fictitious celestial circle formed on imaginary celestial spheres in the sky just above the Earth's equator

 Similarly, to look towards the celestial center line in the southern hemisphere of the Earth, we will look towards the north in the sky
 prithvi ke bumadhya main rahane vaale khagoleey madhya rekha kii ore dekhne ke liye thik apane sir ke upar dekhenge
 The celestial middle line makes it easy to tell about the locations of celestial objects

 The "celestial middle line" is called the "celestial equator" in English
 "khagoleey gole" ko angrezi main "salastial sfair", farsi main "kara-e-aasmaan" or bengali main "kha-golok" kehete hai
 Because the Earth's axis revolving around the sun in its orbit is at an angle of 23
4 °, the same angle is also in the sun line and the celestial center line

 Bismillah Khan of the city of Baba Vishwanath was religious in a strange but exemplary sense
 ve kaashi ke baba vishwanath mandir main jaakar to shehanai bajaate hi the iske alaava ve ganga kinare baithkar ghanton riyaj bhi kiya karte the
 He was a five-time Namaji, always used to participate in festivals, but fasted during Ramadan
 banaras chhodie ke khyaal se hi is kaaran vyathit hote the ki gangaji or kaashi vishwanath se dur nahin rah sakate the
