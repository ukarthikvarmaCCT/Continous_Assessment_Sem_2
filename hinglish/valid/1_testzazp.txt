 It got mixed response from the audience
 aadhunik rasinic evam audyogic gyaan ke vikaas ke saath hi saath rasinic gatiki yaa 'abhikriya gativigyaan' kaa shighrata se vikaas hua he
 As a result, chemical reaction kinetics is no longer limited to laboratories, but now has become a part of industrial plants
 anek rasinic kriyaaon ke dwaara odyogic utpaadan kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, these activities have great importance in the chemical industry
 aadhunik yug main rasinic kriyaaon ke keval praarambhik gyaan se rasinic udyogon kii sthapana evam vikaas sambhav nahin he, visheshat: jab kam laagat ke utpaadan par atyaadhik bal diya jaataa he
 Therefore, in the modern period, intensive study of reaction kinetics has become a major subject of industrial field, not just the subject of laboratory
 pratikriya gativigyaan ke vishyakshetra main vruddhi evam vikaas kaa pramukh kaaran ooshmaa-gati-vigyaan kaa vikaas he
 Main article chemical reaction rate kisi rasinic abhikriya main kisi utpaada kii maatra main ikai samay main hue parivartan ko us abhikriya kii dar kehete hai
 Chemical activity is studied in two major ways
 is reeti se adhyayan karne main rasinic kriya ke praarambhik evam antim rasinic parivartan par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 In this way, special attention is paid to the equilibrium conditions of chemical activity and the evaluation of these conditions in the study
 adhyayan kii yah reeti ganit ke niyamon ke samaan nishchit tathaa kathor siddhanton par aadhaarit hoti he
 The study and analysis of any chemical activity in this manner is based on heat kinetics
 rasinic kriya ke adhyayan kii duusari reeti rasinic parivartan ke anya jatil paksh se sambandhit he, jisamen rasinic kriya ke praarambhik tathaa antim avasthaa tak pahunchne kii gati tathaa paristhitiyon par vishesh bal diya jaataa he
 This study has great importance in chemical industries and it is related to the temporary and ineffective conditions of the action, through which the chemical action achieves perfection or reaches its final stage
 is reeti se adhyayan karne main ganit ke sadrush kathor niyamon kaa aksharsh: paalan nahin kiya jaataa he, varan kriya ke vyaavhaarik paksh par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Therefore, the facts obtained by studying in this way are almost true and sometimes it is only quantitative rather than quantitative
 rasinic kriya kaa is reeti se adhyayan kriyagati vaigyanik adhyayan kaha jaataa he
 The two methods of the study of chemical reactions are interrelated
 vastut: rasinic kriya ke adhyayan main ooshmaa gativigyaan aadharshila ke samaan hoti hai, jisapar kriya gativigyaan aadharshila ke samaan hoti hai, jisapar kriya gativigyaan kaa nirmaan hota he
 In the study of the speed of a chemical action reaching its initial and final state, knowledge of the initial and final stages of the action and the relative stability of each other, or the level of relative balance of the action, is essential
 ooshmaa gativigyaan ke dwaara rasinic kriya ke chaalan vibhav ko, jo rasinic-kriya-pranali kii ek sthiti se duusari sthiti main parivartan kii prakruti kaa dyotak hota he, gyaat tathaa sunishchit kiya ja saktaa he
 Before studying the speed of a chemical action, it is necessary to determine whether the appropriate condition exists for the action
 rasinic kriya kaa chaalan vibhav kriya kii upyukt paristhiti kaa parichaayak hota he, parantu chaalan vibhav kii maatra kii prakruti maatr ko hi bataati he
 In fact, nothing is known with regard to whether or not that action is possible on a practical level, or if the action is actually there
 kisi rasinic parivartan kii gati saamanyat: do karkon par nirbhar karti he
 Of these, the first factor depends directly on the driving force or potential and the second factor depends on the inverse form
 rasinic kriya ke gativigyaan main uparyukt donon karko kaa paraspar sambandh atyant mahatvapurn hota he
 The measurement of the nature of inhibition against chemical changes in a chemical-mechanism is called activation energy
 sakriyan urja kriya ke chaalan vibhav, athwa swatantra kriya kii urja par nirbhar nahin karti
 a mechanical analogy is used to illustrate the difference between the activation energy and conduction potential of the chemical reaction in the lateral diagram
 rasinic kriya main bhaag lenevaali kriyapranali ke anu urja ke vibhinn staron par sthit hote hai
 Generally, the speed of action is accelerated by an increase in temperature
 isi prakaar utprerak padaarth kii upasthiti main kriya kii sthiti main sakriyan urja kam ho jaati he, jisase anu kii kriyasheeltaa main vruddhi hone se kriya kii gati teevr ho jaati he
 For example, in the chemical system of hydrogen and oxygen gas, the combination of these two elements requires that both of these gases be upgraded to the inactivation state in order to generate water
 hydrogen tathaa oxigen gas ke anu kii sakriyan-unnayan-kriya vidyut sphuling se, athwa utprerak padaarth ke prayog se, sakriyan urja main kami ke dwaara utpann kii ja sakati he, jisase saamaanya taap par hydrogen tathaa oxigen ke sanshleshan se jal kii utpatti ho sake
 After synthesis, the mechanism of water in the form of water is located at a lower level of equilibrium, which is a sign of a permanent situation
 uparyukt kriya kii vipareet kriya main, arthath jal vighatan kii kriya main, sakriyan urja, jisaki maatra sanyuktikaran urja tathaa chaalan shakti urja ke baraabar hoti he, aavashyak hoti he
 When this amount of activation energy is available, hydrogen and oxygen gas are produced from water by the action of water dissolution
 at: upyukt kriya kii paristhiti main hydrogen tathaa oxigen gas ke sanyog se jal utpaadan kii kriya ko adhik anukool samajha jaataa he, jab ki jalavighatan kii pratikul kriya uparyukt avasthaa main anukool nahin hoti he Technology has special importance in the design and production of industrial equipment
 at: upkaran abhikalp ke kaary main prayog kii janevaali prayogtmak saamagree ko niyantrit prayogon dwaara pehle praapt kiya jaataa he
 In controlled conditions, these experiments are first carried out in the laboratory, then in the director plant and sometimes in large-scale industrial plants, by conducting tests
 nideshak sanyantr ke nirmaan main prayog kii janevaali prayogtmak saamagree ko prayogshaala ke praarambhik prayogon dwaara ekatra kiya jaataa he
 Analysis of action has special significance in the determination of a chemical action
 rasinic kriya ke vishleshan kii ritiyon ko teen pramukh virgo main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the first method of analysis, the mixture sample is extracted from the mixture of the system at different and fixed time intervals and it is quickly cooled to avoid any further chemical reaction, or at least, in the mixture sample
 Is, and the quantity of products obtained after the action is determined
 rasinic kriya ke vishleshan kii dwitiya reeti main kriya mishran ke kai namoonon main rasinic kriya ek saath prarambh kii jaati he tathaa vibhinn evam nishchit samay ke ananthar, ek ke uparaant ek mishran namoonay ko thanda kiya jaataa he, jisase kriya mishran ke us ansh main kriya or nunatam ho, tathaa is ansh kaa rasinic vishleshan kar liya jaataa he
 In the third method of analysis, by using physical chemical methods without extracting the mixture samples from the reaction mixture, the initial substances and the quantity of substances produced after the action are determined
 is prakaar kii bhautikeey rasinic ritiyon main prakaash dhruvanmiti varnmiti, varnakram avasheshgamiti, ke nimnaankit teen pramukh roopon, main vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 This process system is called constant volume, cubic process, flow process and static pressure cubic process respectively
 prayogshaala main praaia: pehle varg kii prakriya vyavastha dwaara prayogtmak saamagree kaa ekatrikaran kiya jaataa he
 The process systems of this class are generally simple and direct, except for processes in which pressure changes greatly, as in gas processes
 nideshak sanyantr ke prayogon main saamanyat: duusare varg kii prakriya vyavastha se prayogtmak prakriya saamagree kaa ekatrikaran kiya jaataa he
 The material obtained from the use of this class is directly used in the flow processes of the industrial process vessel
 tisare varg kii prakriya vyavastha kii prayogtmak reeti atyant jatil hoti he, at: iskaa prayog simit he
 The process arrangement of this class maintains a state of constant pressure by a change in the volume of the process system
 yah kaary atyant kathin hota he, visheshkar un kriyaaon main jinamein pravastha kaa parivartan hota he
 Chemical reactions are basically divided into two groups
 pratham samooh main samang kriyaaon ko sammilit kiya jaataa he, jinaki kriyapranali main keval ek pravastha hoti he
 There is presence of more than one phase in heterogeneous actions of the second group
 utprerit kriyaaon main utprarek padaarth tathaa kriya pranali ke antarastareey antakriya ke kaaran sampurna rasinic kriya ko vishmang kriya kaha jaataa he
 Chemical processes are also classified as flow or paddy processes
 pravaah prakram kriya main sthir paristhiti kii avasthaa praapt hoti he, jisase sthir aaytan ke kriyapaatr main samay ke sandarbh main koi parivartan nahin hota he
 In this type of action process, the substances produced after the action change in terms of time in the system
 prakriya pranali main, kriya main bhaag lenevaale padaartho ko mishrit kiya jaataa he tathaa kriya hone dene ke liye ek nishchit samay tak rakhaa jaataa he
 After the end of this period, the product substances are separated from the system
 jin avasthaaon main kriya hoti he, unke aadhaar par bhi kriyaaon kaa vargeekaran kiya jaataa he
 Exhaled heat is removed as a result of the action in the heat process, or the heat of action is kept constant by the heat supply in the state of heat absorption
 duusari ore kriyapranali ko visanvahit karne se kriya ke ooshmaasthanantaran ko avaruddh kiya ja saktaa he
 This type of action is called orthodox verb
 kisi kathor kriyapaatr main kriya hone dene par kriyapranali ke aaytan main koi parivartan nahin hota he
 The action of this condition is called the action of static pressure when the phase is under constant pressure
 saamanyat: sthir aaytan kii kriya ghaanprakram se tathaa sthir dabaav kii kriya pravaahprakram se sambhddha hoti he
 In terms of action dynamics, the actions that take place in both directions are called reversible and the action in the same direction is called unidirectional or non-reversible
 ooshmaa gativigyaan ke kshetra main utkramntic kriya kaa bhinn drushtikon se vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 According to heat kinetics, all the functions of a separate system are irreversible
 at: kriya gatiki main utkramntic kriya kaa ooshmaa gativigyaan se purnat: bhinn arth hota he
 Separation of all the substances that perform actions in a closed system can make each action theoretically, verb kinetics reversible
 isi prakaar se prayek kriya prarambh main ekadishiya hoti he
 In the case of opposite action, the quantity of product obtained after the action decreases
 at: utkramntic kriya ko jahaan tak ho sake nahin hone diya jaataa he
 In reversible actions, if any one of the product substances produced after the action is removed from the system, the reversible action starts like a directional verb
 ooshmaa gativigyaan ke aadhaar par rasinic kriyaaon ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kriya kii gati kriya main bhaag lenevaale prayek anu kii sakriy sandratha ke anupaat main hoti he
 If a substance called a and b has an action and the active concentrations of their molecules are a and b respectively and the active concentrations of the molecules of the product substance r and s after the action are r and s respectively, then this action is expressed as can go : aa + bb rr + s
s
 In the above action, the speed of the leading verb is as follows agragami kriya kii gati = k f 
 a b { \ displaystyle kf
{ \ left^{a} \ left^{b}}} Kf = action speed constant in this equation; { \ displaystyle \ left} = The active concentration of the b component in the action mixture and a and b express the number of molecules of the a and b components of the action, respectively
 uparyukt aadhaar par vipareet kriya kii gati = k b 
 r s { \ displaystyle kb
{ \ left^{r} \ left^{s}}} ; In the situation of equilibrium, the speed of the forward and retrograde actions becomes equal, which reduces the speed of the entire action
 at: samyavastha kii paristhiti main Equilibrium constant: k = kf / kb = rsab { \ displaystyle = { \ frac { \ left ^ {r} \ left ^ {s}} { \ left ^ {a} \ left ^ {b xxrep 4 } arenius sameekaran, dekhen In chemical activity, heat is the measurement of molecular speed
 at: kriya ke taap main vruddhi se kriyagati kii urja main bhi vruddhi hoti he or kriyagati kii urja main vruddhi hone se kriyagati main tivrata aati he
 According to Arrhenius's theory, an increase in activity with heat and activation energy has the following relationship: is sameekaran main k kriyagati sthiraank, a anupaati sthiraank, Ea sakriyan urja, t taap tathaa r saarvatrik gas niyatank ko vyakt karata he
 a and Ea are often constants in case of small change in temperature in the action
 saamaanya taap par honevaali adhikansh samang rasinic kriyaaon main taap main 100 sein
 kii vruddhi hone se kriyagati sthiraank praaia: duguna ho jaataa he
 In the flow process, the ratio of the volume and delivery of the verb is related to the position
 kriya main pradaay aaytan kii gati tathaa kriyapaatr ke aaytan ke sah sambadh kii kriya kii sthangati kaha jaataa he
 Multiple actions occurring simultaneously जब When some or all substances participating in a chemical action perform more than one action at the same time, the dynamic equation of the action becomes extremely complex
 at: is prakaar kii ek saath honevaali anek kriyaaon ke kriya-gati-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bindurekhiy reeti kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In these types of actions, new and additional substances are produced due to the synergy of the substances produced after the action
 anugami kriyaaon kii maala ko, jisamen kriyaaon kii baar baar aavriti hoti ho, shrinkhalabaddh kriya kaha jaataa he
 Such series of verbs are sometimes very long
 at: rinatmak utprerak padaartho, athwa avarohak padaartho ke prati shrinkhalabaddh kriyaayein atyant sugrahi hoti hai, kyonki kisi ek anu par hajaaron anuon se nirmit sampurna shrunkhlaa kii kadi nirbhar karti he
 The simplest example of chain reactions is the synthesis of hydrogen and chlorine gas in the combination of light, which results in the production of hydrogen chloride
 is kriya main nimnaankit kriyaaon kii maala ke dwaara kriya sampann hoti he : Cl2 + light-absorption -> 2cl Cl + H2 --> hcl + h h + Cl2 -> hcl + Cl Cl + H2 --> hcl + h As soon as permeable chlorine is formed by the absorption of light in action, it reacts with hydrogen to produce permeable hydrogen, which again reacts with chlorine to liberate permeable chlorine and thus this gradual evolution of action , Thus increasing the amount of hydrogen chloride
 samanyat: adhikansh vishmang kriyaayein utprerakon ke prayog dwaara utprerit kriyaaon ke kshetra main pai jaati hai
 Many exceptions are also found in this general belief
 anek vishmang kriyaaon kii kriyapranali main vibhinn pravastha ke kriyasheel padaarth upasthit hote hai
 Ethylene glycol is formed by the interaction of ethylene oxide and water
 yah kriya nimnaankit rup main pradarshit kii jaati he : C2H4O + H2O -> C2 H4 2 uparyukt kriya vishmaang kriya he
 In heterozygous actions of different phases, the plant of action-dynamics depends on chemical factors, just like homogeneous actions, or else it depends on both physical and chemical factors
 is prakaar vishamang kriyaaon main visaran atyant mahatvapurn kaarak hota he
 The kinetics-analysis of heterosexual actions is very complex
 kyonki sabhi pravastha kii kriyaaon kaa ek saath vishleshan karnaa hota he, at: audyogic drushti se praaia: sabhi kriyaaon ke vishleshan main anubhavjanya ritiyon kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain peak in the world, is on the border of Nepal in the northwest part of Sikkim
 kanchanajangha naam kii utpatti tibeti mul ke chaar shabdon se huyi he, jinhen aamtaur par kong-chhen-dajon-ga yaa yang-chhen-dajo-ga likhaa jaataa he

 sigmund frid austria ke tantrikavigyaani tathaa manovishleshan ke sansthaapak the
 Sigmund Freud was born in the city of Freiburg in the austrian-hungarian Empire
 unke mata-pita yahudee the
 Freud's father was a wool merchant and his mother's third wife
 frid apane saat bhai-bahanon main sabase bade the
 At the age of 3, Freud's father moved to Leipzig and a year later moved to Vienna, where he lived for about 80 years
 frid ne vienna vishvavidhyalay se 1881 main doctor of medicine kiya
 Freud fled to London in 1938 due to Hitler's Nazi uprising
 landan main hi san 1939 ke sitambar maheene main unki mrityu ho gai
 Shortly before the beginning of the nineteenth century, psychology developed as an independent science
 isse pehle manovigyaan ko darshan ke antargat padhaa jaataa tha
 The aim of psychology at that time was to analyze and study the consciousness of adult human beings
 frid ne is paramparaagat "chetana ke manovigyaan " kaa virodh kiya or manovishleshan sambandhi kai nai sankalpanaaon kaa pratipaadan kiya jisapar hamaara aadhunik manovigyaan tikaa hua he
 Looking at Freud's early life, we find that from the beginning his inclination was towards neuroscience
 san 1873 se 1881 ke bich unka sampark us samay ke mashhoor tantrika vigyaani ernest bruki se hua
 Freud was influenced by Ernst Brookey and began work in his laboratory
 sharir vigyaan or tantrika vigyaan main kai shodh patr prakashit karne ke baad frid ernest bruki se alag hue or unhone apana nijee vyavsaay chikitsak ke rup main prarambh kiya
 In 1881, Freud received his M
D
 from the University of Vienna
 isse thik thode se vakt pehle frid kaa sampark joseph briuvar se hua
 Freud wrote the paper "studies in Hysteria" with Joseph Briuver
 "studies in histyria" ek rogi ke vishleshan par aadhaarit tha, jiskaa kaalpanik naam "anna o" tha
 It is believed that the seeds of psychoanalyticism were hidden in this paper
 yah shodh bahut mashhoor hua
 In 1896, there was a professional disagreement between Brewer and Freud and they separated
 san 1900 frid ke jivan kaa sabase mahatvapurn varsh tha
 In the same year his famous book "interpretation of Dream" was published, based on his and his patients' dream analyzes
 isamen unhone bataaya ki sapane hamaari atrupt ichchhaaon kaa pratibimb hote hai
 This book made him famous
 kai samakaleen buddhijivi or manovigyaani unki ore aakarshith hue
 Prominent among them are Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Otto Rank, and Sanador Française
 in sabhi vyaktiyon se frid kaa acha sampark tha, par baad main matbhinnata hui or log unase alag hote gayi
 In 1909, the famous psychologist at Clark University, GS
 Recently Freud received an invitation to lecture on psychoanalysis, which proved to be a milestone in his fame
 In addition to Freud, Yung, Vryl, Jones, Ferencji and many other famous psychologists were present
 yahon se frid jald hi waapas laut gaye, kyonki america kaa vaataavaran unhen acha nahi laga
 yahan frid ko pet main gadabadi kii shikaayat rahane lagi thi, jiskaa kaaran unhone vividh america khaadya saamagree ko bataaya
 Jung and Adler agreed with several points of Freud's psychoanalyticism
 parantu frid dwaara sex par atyadhik bal die jane ko unhone asweekrut kar diya
 This separated them both at different times
 jung ne manovishleshan main saanskrithik viraasat ke dakhal par or edler ne saamaajikta par bal diya
 Although it is true that professional colleagues were getting separated from him one by one, yet his fame did not matter
 san 1923 main frid ke muh main cancer kaa pataa chalaa jiskaa kaaran unka zarurat se zyada cigar pinaa bataaya gaya
 In 1933, Hitler took over Germany's power
 usne saaf kaha ki frid vaad ke liye uski satta main koi jagah nahi he
 Hitler burned all of Freud's books and manuscripts
 vah shaayad isse bhi adhik bura vyavhaar karata lekin raajnneetik dabaav or tatkaaleen american rajdoot ke hastkshep ke baad hitler ne frid se jabardasti ek kaagaj par hastakshar karavaaya ki sainikon ne unke saath koi bura vyavhaar nahi kiya he
 After this he was ordered to leave Vienna and go to London
 landan main unka bhavy swaagat hua
 He was immediately made a member of the Royal Society
 yahan unhone apni antim pustak "mozej and monethism" kaa prakaashan karavaaya
 Freud considered the form of mind or personality to be dynamic
 unke anusaar vyaktitv hamaare mastishk evam sharir kii kriyaaon kaa naam he
 Freud has mental elements that do not come into consciousness or come into consciousness in the state of hypnosis or consciousness
 isamen balykaal kii icchhaaen, langik icchhaaen or maansik sangharsh aadi se sambandhit ve icchhaaen hoti hai, jinka gyaan swayan vyakti ko bhi nahin hota
 These are usually not able to be fulfilled in a person's daily life and they appear in a distorted form, either in the form of dreams or in the form of hysterical seizures
 frid ke anusaar vyaktitv kaa gatyaatmak paksh teen avasthaaon dwaara nirmit hota he - Idi originates with the birth of a human being
 frid ise vyaktitv kaa sabase mahatvapurn hissaa maanata tha
 Its contents are desires that are related to libido and seek immediate satisfaction
 urja kii vruddhi idan nahin sahan kar paata or agar ise sahi dhang se abhivyakti nahi milti tab yah vikrut swarup dhaaran karke vyakti ko prabhavit karata he
 For Freud, self-consciousness was like what he called a secondary regulator of human behavior
 yah idan kaa sangathit bhaag he, iskaa uddeshy idan ke lakshyon ko aage badhanaa he
 Para ego is a type of behavior model from which ethical behaviors are employed
 iskaa vikaas apekshaakrit der se hota he
 Freud's personality ideas are also called the theory of psychological development
 ise frid ne 5 avasthaaon main baanta he - Based on these, he conceptualized the controversial Electra and Oedipus Complex, according to which the sexual power of the infant is initially effective for itself, gradually being oriented towards other people
 isi kaaran putr mata kii ore tathaa putree pita kii ore adhik aakarshith hote hai
 This leads to a love for the mother and rivalry for the father in boys, which Freud named Oedipus Complex
 yah bahut vivaadaaspad or charchit avadharana rahi he
 Freud could not provide figures to prove the truth of these concepts
 He was criticized by critics for mixing his experiences with these observations and blindly believing what his patients said
 frid par yah bhi aarope lage ki vah manovigyaan main zarurat se adhik kalpanashiltaa or mithkeey granthon kaa ghalmail kar rahe hai, yon aavashyaktaaon ko zarurat se adhik sthaan de rahe hai
 Looking at Freud's work and his beliefs based on them, we find that Freud exerted more on human bestial tendencies
 unhone yah spasht kiya ki nimnatar pashuon ke bahut saare gun or visheshtaayen manushyon main bhi dikhaai detii hai
 The concept of basic tendency as defined by him also comes under this
 frid kaa yah mat tha ki vayask vyakti ke swabhaav main kisi prakaar kaa parivartan nahin laayaa ja saktaa kyonki uske vyaktitv kii neenv bachapan main hi pad jaati he, jise kisi bhi tareeke se badla nahi ja saktaa
 haalaanki baad ke shodhon se yah sabit ho chukaa he ki manushya multah bhavishya unmukh hota he
 Like an academic psychologist, Freud's psychology does not see serialization, but he gave psychology a new definition, on the basis of which we find modern psychoanalytic psychology to stand and, despite all the criticisms, Freud's contribution to abnormal psychology and clinical psychology is not ignored
 Can be done
 frid dwaara pratipaadit manovishleshan kaa sampradaay apni lokapriyata ke karan bahut charchit rahaa
 frid ne kai pustake likhin jinamein se "inter pratesan of drims", "group psychology and da enelysis of di igo ", "totem and tabu " or "civilaijesan and its diskaantents " pramukh hai
 He died on 23 September 1939 in London

 Nahusha gained power from all the gods, sages and Gandharvas and started enjoying heaven
 aksmaat ek din unki drushti indraki sadhvi patni shachi par padi
 On seeing Shachi, he became disillusioned and tried his best to get it
 jab shachi ko nahush kii buree niyat kaa abhasahua to vah bhaybheet hokar dev-guru brihaspati ke sharanmen ja pahaunchi or nahush kii kamechha ke vishay membetate huye kaha, “he gurudev! ab aap hi mere satitvaki raksha karen

 Modulation is the process of distinguishing one waveform from another waveform
 doorsanchaar main adhimishran kaa istemaal sandesh bhejne ke liye hota he, lekin ek sangeetkaar swar-saamanjasy ke liye kisi vaadyayantra ke swar kii maatra, uskaa samay yaa timming or swaraghaat ko alag karne main iskaa upyog karata he
 Often high frequency sinusoid waveforms are used as carrier signals for low-frequency signals
 sin wave ke teen pramukh maapdand hai - uskaa apana aayam, uske charan or uski aavriti, ek modulated singnal praapt karne ke liye in sabhi sanchaar sanket ko kam frequency ke aadhaar par sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 The device which performs modulation is called modulator and the device which performs the opposite action is called demodulator
 jo upkaran donon hi tarah kaa kaary kar saktaa he vah modem kehalaata he 
 The purpose of digital modulation is to transfer digital bit streams to an analog passband channel, for example; Public switched telephone networks, or transfers over a limited radio frequency band
 anuroop adhimishran kaa uddeshy ek anuroop besaband sanket ko hastantarit karnaa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek audio sanket yaa tivi sanket ko ek anuroop pasband channel par hastantarit karnaa he, doosraa udhaaharan radio frequency band yaa cabel tivi network channel ko simit karnaa bhi he
 Analog and numerical modulation simplifies frequency division multiplexing, while simultaneously transferring multiple low-pass information signals via separate passband channels via a shared physical medium
 ankiy besaband adhimishran pranali, jo ki line koding kehalaata he, kaa uddeshy bhi ek ankiy bit stream par besaband channel ko, ek serial bas yaa taar dwaara jude local aria network jaise non filter-tambe ke taar ke jariye hastanantarit karnaa he
 The purpose of a pulse modulation system is to transfer a narrowband analog signal, for example a call call coming to a wideband baseband channel, or in some schemes the beat stream to another digital transmission system
 anuroop adhimishran main, anuroop information sanket par adhimishran lagaataar chalata rahata he
 Common analog modulation techniques are as follows: ankiy adhimishran main, anuroop vaahak sanket ek ankiy bit pravaah ke jariye adhimishrit hota he
 The digital modulation method can have digital-to-analog conversion and demodulation or detection can be analog-to-digital conversion
 vaahak sanket main parivartan m vikalp pratikon ke ek parimit sankhya se chune jate hai
 a common example: a telephone line is designed to transfer audible sound, for example take a tone, it is not numeric bits
 computer isiilie telephone main modem ke jariye sampark sthapit kar saktaa he, jo ankiy bits kaa pratinidhitiv tone, jise pratik kehete hai, ke dwaara karata hai
 If there are four choice symbols, the first symbol can represent bit sequence 00, similarly the second one on 01, the third 10 and the fourth 11
 If a modem plays music with 1000 tones per second, its symbol rate is 1000 symbols
 / Per second, or baud
 Since each tone in this example represents a message with two numeric bits, the bit rate is twice the symbol rate i
e
 2000 bits per second
 ankiy sanket kii ek paribhaasha ke anusaar, adhimishrit sanket ek ankiy sanket he, lekin ek anya paribhaasha main adhimishran ko ankiy se anuroop ke roopantaran bhi kaha gaya he
 In most textbooks, the digital modulation scheme is synonymous with data transmission as digital transmission, in very few textbooks it is called analog transmission
 atyaadhik moulik ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: In QAM, an infinite signal and a quadrature phase amplitude are expressed in a finite number
 ise ek tu-channel pranali ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, harek channel ASK kaa upyog karata he
 The resulting signal is equivalent to a combination of both PSK and ASK
 uparokt sabhi paddati main harek charan, aavruti yaa aayam ek adbhut dohare beats ke pattern dwaara tay hote hai
 Typically, each phase encodes the same number of beats of frequency or amplitude
 is bits kii sankhya main shaamil pratik kaa pratinidhitiv vishesh charan dwaara hota he
 If the alphabet includes m = 2 n { \ displaystyle m = 2 ^ {N}} as an optional symbol, each symbol represents a message of n bits
 yadi pratik dar f s { \ displaystyle f_{s}} pratik prati second he, data dar n f s { \ displaystyle nf_{s}} beats prati second he
 For example, an alphabet that has 16 optional symbols, each symbol represents 4 bits
 isliye data dar bod dar se chaar guna hoga
 In PSK, ASK or QAM, where the carrier frequency of the modulated signal is constant, the modulation alphabet often simply represents the zodiac, the i signal of the amplitude for each signal representing the x-axis and the q signal by the y-axis
 QAM ke siddhant kaa upyog kar PSK or ASK, lekin kabhi-kabhi FSK bhi aksar paidaa kiya or pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 The i and q signal can be combined into the complex-value signal i + jq
 natijatan samatuly lo-paas sanket yaa samatuly besband sanket ke naam se janaa jane vaala vaastavik maan adhimishrit sanket physical sanket jatil maan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The following are the common steps useful for transmitting data by a modulator: resiver kii ore se aamtaur par di-modulator nimna kaary karata he: It is common in all digital communication systems that both the modulator and the de-modulator must be designed simultaneously
 Numerical modulation schemes are possible because both the sender-recipient parties must know in advance how to encrypt the data and how to represent the communication system
 In all digital communication systems, both the modifier of the sender and the de-modulator of the receiver are designed in such a way that they can work with each other in addition to their work
 asangat adhimishran paddati main ek praapak ko sandarbh kaald sanket jo ki preshak vaahak wave ke saath ek hi charan main ghatit hota he, kii jarurat nahin hoti
 aise maamle main adhimishran sanket main atulykaalik rup se sthanantarit hota hai
 The opposite is favorable modulation
 sabase zyada aam ankiy adhimishran takanic is prakaar hai: MSK and GMSK are special cases of continuous phase modulation
 darasal, CPM ke upakutumb kaa MSK vishesh maamla he, jo ki continus phej frequency-shift keeing ek sankethik-samay kii avadhi ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he, jo ki ek ytaakar aavruti pulse he
 OFDM is based on frequency division multiplexing, but is used as a numerical modulation scheme
 bit stream kai samanaantar data strimon main vibhajit ho jaataa he or harek stream paaramparik ankiy adhimishran yojana kaa upyog kar apane sab-carrier main sthanantarit ho jaataa he
 The OFDM signal is an abbreviated form of a modulated subcarrier
 OFDM ek bahuvidhi takanic ke bajaay ek adhimishran takanic ke rup main mana jaataa he, kyonki yah kisi bit stream ko tathakthith OFDM ke ek anukram kaa upyag karke sanchaar channel main hastantarit kar detaa he
 OFDM can be expanded from channel access method to orthogonal frequency division multiple access and MC-CDMA scheme to multi-user channel, so that multiple users can use the same medium by giving code to different subcarriers or multiple users
 Allow to do
 do prakaar ke RF power vistaarak, swichan vistaarak kam keemat vaala he or ek hi output pavaar vaale liner vistaarak kii tulana main kam bydaree pavaar kaa upyog karata he
 However, they only work with relatively stable amplitude modulation signals such as angular modulation and CDMA, but not with QAM and OFDM
 Although the switching amplifier is also completely unsuitable for a common QAM group, the QAM modulation principle is often used to allow switching amplifiers to run with these fms and other waveforms, and sometimes QAM de-modulation uses these switching
 This is done to get the signal by the expanders
 ankiy besaband adhimishran shabd pankti kuta yaa sanket kaa paryaay he
 It is a method of transferring a digital beat stream to the analog baseband, using a pulse train, which is a discrete numbered signal level, directly through modulating the voltage and current in the cable
 ekadhruviya, non-ritern-tu-jiro, manchester or alternet mark invarsan kutalekhan vagairah iske saamaanya udhaaharan hai
 The purpose of pulse modulation scheme is to transfer a narrowband analog signal to the pulse wave via modulation as a two-level signal in the analog baseband
 kuch pulse adhimishran yojana nairoband anuroop sanket ko ek ankiy sanket ek sthai bit rate; jo ki anternihit ankiy preshak paddati he, ke rup main sthanantarit ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye kuch pankti kuta, ko sthanantaran kii anumati pradaan karata he
 In the formal sense, they do not fall under the modulation scheme, as they are not channel coding schemes, but should be treated as source encoding schemes and in some cases as analog-to-digital conversion techniques

 Say poets with poetry, tum meri jivan aadhaar
 My existence is from you only tumse meraa sansar 
 Poets have a different importance in the world
 prayek manushya swayan main ek kavi he
 This history honors those great poets
 jo sansar ko dheron gyaan se bhar gayi
 He who creates his own future is also a poet
 main swayan ko us pahalu par na pahunchaa saki
 The aspect on which a poet is
 meraa parichay—anuraadhaa treepathi The history of Kavi Sammelan is very old
 isliye kavi-sammelnon ke armbh kii tithi gyaat karnaa sambhav nahin he
 But in 1920, the first major poet conference was held which had many poets and listeners
 uske baad kavi sammelan bhartiya samskruti kaa abhinn bhaag ban gaya
 Today, not only in India, but around the world, poet conferences are organized on a large scale
 bharat main swatantraaa ke baad se 80 ke dashak ke aarmabhik dinon tak kavi sammelnon kaa 'svarnim kaal' kaha ja saktaa he
 From the late 80s to the late 90s, India's youth remained entangled in many problems such as unemployment
 iskaa prabhaav kavi-sammelnon par bhi hua or bharat kaa yuva varg is kala se dur hota gaya
 New tools of entertainment such as television and later the Internet heavily influenced poet conventions, just like circuses, magic shows, and dramas
 kavi sammelan sakhyaan or gunvattta, donon hi drushti se kamazor hote chale gaye
 There was also a huge drop in the number of listeners
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki vibhnn samasyaon se ghire yuva dobaaraa kavi-sammelan kii ore nahin laute
 Also, in those days there was a shortage of outstanding poets who were crowded
 lekin nai sahastrabdi ke armbh hote hi yuva varg, jo ki apana adhiktar bachaa hua samay internet par guzaartaa tha, kavi sammelan ko pasand karne laga
 Videos of many poems started reaching that category through the Internet
 yuvaaon ne nay video talashna, unhen internet par aplod karnaa, downlod karnaa or aapas main baantnaa armbh kiya
 Within about five years, millions of young poets liked conferences
 is peedi kii kavi sammelnon kii ore zordaar vaapasi kaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he, ki you-tub naamak websit par ek kavi kii prastuti ko saade maanch lakh se bhi adhik logon ne ab tak dekha he
 The period from 2004 to 2010 can also be called the second golden period of Hindi Kavi Sammelan
 shrotaaon kii tezi se babbti hui sankhya, gunvattta vaale kaviyon kaa aagaman or sabase bad ke, yuvaaon kaa is kala se waapas judana is baat kii pushti karata he
 Traditionally, Kavi Sammelan was limited to social events, government programs, private events and a few corporate celebrations
 lekin ikkisvin shatabdi ke armbh main shaikshik sansthaaon main isaki babbti sankhya prabhavit karne vaali he
 Educational institutions in which poets' conferences are held include iits, iims, nits, Universities, Engineering, Medical, Management and other institutions
 uparokt suchanaaen is baat kii taraf ishaara karti he, ki kavi sammelnon kaa rup badal rahaa he
 Hindi lovers organize Hindi Kavi Sammelan all over the world
 vishwa kaa koi bhi bhaag aaj kavi sammelnon se achoota nahin he
 The countries that have organized the most poets' conferences after India include USA, Dubai, Muscat, Singapore, UK etc
 inamen se adhiktar kavi sammelnon main bharat ke prasiddh kaviyon ko aamantrit kiya jaataa he
 Poets' conferences are held throughout the year in India
 bharat main kavi sammelan ke aayojakon main saamaajik sansthaaen, saanskrithik sansthaaen, sarkari santhaan, corporate or shaikshik santhaan agrani hai
 In the olden times, social institutions used to organize poets' conferences, but since the beginning of this millennium, educational institutions have held the most number of conferences
 kavi sammelnon ke aayojan ke dhang main bhi baari badlaav aae hai
 Even poets' conferences are now booked on the Internet
 kavi sammelan ke parmparik rup main ab tak bahut adhik badlaav nahin dekhe gaye hai
 In a traditional poet convention, there are some poets of different juices and there is a moderator
 kaviyon kii kul sankhya vaise to 20 yaa 30 tak bhi hoti he, lekin sadhrant: ek kavi sammelan main 7 se 12 tak kavi hote hai
 From around 2005, there were some changes in the structure of the Kavi Sammelan
 ab to ekal kavi sammelan bhi yojit kiye jate hai 
 In a traditional poet convention, poets sit on a mattress placed on the stage
 manch par do maaiken hoti hai- ek vah, jis par khadey ho kar kavi ek ek kar ke kavita-paath karte hai or doosraa wo, jiske saamne sanchaalak baitha rahata he
 The moderator first introduces all the poets and then invites them to recite poetry one by one
 iskaa kram saadharantaya kanishthatam kavi se varishthatam kavi tak hota he
 Thousands of poets have gathered on the Kavi Sammelan forums so far, but there are some of them who will be remembered forever for their performance on stage

 For this work] and alternating current can be used, but direct current is more convenient
 electrode do prakaar ke hote hai : carbon ke or dhaatu ke
 There are also three types of metal electrodes: bare, covered, and polled
 dhaatu ke electrode kii adhik kaam main aate hai
 Carbon electrodes are predominant in some automated devices
 jin electrodon main 0
9 pratishat se adhik manganeez mila hota he, ve bhi acha kaam dete hai
 Similarly, aluminum weld lights also work well
 yah dhaatu kii battiyon ke saath 18 se 30 volt or carbon ke saath 80 se 100 volt tak rakhaa jaataa he
 It keeps decreasing according to the length of the arch and there is also a deposit of molten metal by the same proportion

 vidyut dhara kaa pravaah electrode ke kaary or motaai ke anusaar hi hona chahie
 If the current of the stream is light, the metal of the electrode will not penetrate the wrinkles and will not even weld the surface
 yadi pravaah bahut tej hoga, to electrode kii dhaatu jal jaaegi or jod kamjor pad jayega
 Nevertheless, it is only appropriate that the speed of the electric current be kept somewhat faster than the ratio
 dhanke hue electrodon main adhik tej dhara pravaahit karne se uski gali dhaatu par slag nahin aane paata, jo uski raksha ke liye atyant upyogi hai

 While drawing the shape from a to F, some distance between the two plates automatically remains, which is a thing of great importance
 adhik faasla rakhane se gali hui dhaatu neeche gir jaati he to phir weldon karnaa kathin ho jaataa he or kam faasla chhodane se platon kii jad tak dhaatu nahin pahunchne paati
 Therefore, in thin plates, the distance is increased to 3 / 16 inch in plates up to about 1 / 16 inch wide and 2 inch thickness respectively

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he

 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many

 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary

 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai

 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina

 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai

 Muhammad earned al-sadiq and al-aminaka titles in the caravan business of his uncle Abu Talib
 khadija ne mohammad ko kaam par rakhaa,tab ve 25 saal ke the
 Khazimah ibn Hakim, a relative of Khadija, told Khadija that he would have to double the commission of Muhammad
 khadija ne apane sevakon, main se maysarah ko mohammad kii sahaayta ke liye bheja
 Upon returning, Maysarah reported that Muhammad had done business with great authenticity, resulting in double profits
 maysarah ne yah bhi kaha ki vaapasi yatra par, mohammad ek ped ke neeche aaraam karne ke liye baith gaye

 Khadija's uncle accepted the offer, and was married

 Another Zaid ibne Harithah, from the Oudhra tribe who was kidnapped and sold into slavery

 Muhammad said that Zaid should be left where he lived
 zayd ne khadija or mohammad ko chhodkar jane se manaa kar diya, jiske baad mohammad ne kanoonee taur par apane hi bete ke rup main use apanaaya or zayd ke saath rahane kaa faisla kiya
 According to traditional Sunni legend, when Muhammad conveyed his first revelation from Angel Gabriel to Khadija, Khadija was the first person to convert to Islam

 After a while, Muhammad narrated the experience to Khadija
 khadija ne unhen tasalli di or kaha ki"nishchit rup se kisi bhi khatre se use bachaane ke liye allaah ne yah anubhav diya hoga or vah jibril shanti or sulah ke liye tha or usne hameshaa dosti kaa haath badhaayaa
