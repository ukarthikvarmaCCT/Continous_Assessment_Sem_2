 kisi bhi shabd ko anshon main todakar bolaa ja saktaa he or shabdaansh shabd ke vah ansh hote hai jinhen or zyaada chota nahin banaaya ja saktaa varanaa shabd kii dhvaniyaan badal jaati hai
 For example, the word 'suddenly' has three syllables - 'A', 'cha' and 'naq'
 yadi ruk-ruk kar 'a-chaa-nak' bolaa jaye to shabd ke teenon shabdaansh khandit rup se dekhe ja sakate hai lekin shabd kaa uccharan sunne main sahi prathit hota he
 If 'nak' is broken further, the sounds of the word become wrong - 'a-cha-na-k'
 This word is also not called 'a-chan-k' because it also makes the pronunciation wrong
 kuch chote shabdon main ek hi shabdaansh hota he, jaise 'main', 'kaan', 'haath', 'chal' or 'ja'
 kuch shabdon main do shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'chalakar', khaanaa, rumal or sabzi 
 Some have three or more syllables, such as 'important' and 'international'
 akshar shabd kaa arth he - 'jo na ghat sake, na nasht ho sake'
 It was earlier used for 'speech' or 'speech' and for syllable
 'varna' ke liye bhi akshar kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa
 This is the reason that the word 'letter' is also commonly used today for the characters expressed by script signs
 bhashaa ke vaigyanik adhyayan ne akshar ko angreji 'silabal' kaa arth pradaan kar diya he, jisamen swar, swar tathaa vyanjan, anuswaar sahit swar yaa vyanjan dhvaniyaan sammilit maani jaati hai
 a unit of sound or sound community spoken in the same stroke or force is called akshara
 ikai kii pruthakta kaa aadhaar swar yaa swararat vyanjan hota he
 The consonant sound comes as a part of the vowel in an accent or on the ante
 astu, akshar main swar hi merudand he
 Neither a vowel can be separated from a vowel, nor is a vowel formed without vowels or vowel consonants
 uccharan main yadi vyanjan moti kii tarah he to swar dhaage kii tarah
 If the voice is a strong emperor then the consonant is the king
 isi aadhaar par praayah akshar ko swar kaa paryaay maan liya jaataa he, kintu aisa he nahin, phir bhi akshar nirmaan main swar kaa atyadhik mahatv hota he
 Consonant sounds in some languages also help in letter formation
 angreji bhashaa main na, r, l jaisi vyanjan dhvaniyaan swararat bhi uccharit hoti hai evam swardhvani ke samaan akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 Akshar word is used in Hindi for English Syllable
 dow ramvilas sharma ne silabal ke liye 'swarik' shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 
 chunki akshar shabd kaa bhashaa or vyakaran ke itihaas main anek arthchhaya ke liye prayog kiya gaya he, isliye silabal ke arth main iske prayog se bhramasrijan kii ashanka rahati he
 In the pronunciation of a word, the sound which has peak or height is the same letter or syllable, as on the sound in the hand
 is shabd main ek akshar he
 The word 'unimaginative' has three letters - A, Kal, Pit; Three - come to freedom; That is, where there is a separation of the pronunciation of the vowel in the word, there is a separation of the letter
 dhwani utpaadan kii drushti se vichaar karne par phuffus sanchalan kii ikai ko akshar yaa swarik kehete hai, jisamen ek hi sheershadhvani hoti he
 From the point of view of anatomy, the letter or vocal can also be called pleural pulsation, which is pronounced in the sound system
 jab dhwani khand yaa alpatam dhwani samooh ke uccharan ke samay avyav sanchalan akshar main ucchtam ho to vah dhwani aksharvat hoti he
 Vowel sounds are often pronounced syllable and consonant sounds are pronounced
 shabdagat uccharan kii nitant pruthak ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he, yatha The number of letters in a word does not depend on how many sounds it contains, but rather on how much shock or shock the word is pronounced, ie how many disjoint sound units are in the word
 akshar main prayukt sheersh dhwani ke atirikt shesh dhvaniyon ko 'akshrang' yaa 'gahvar dhwani' kaha jaataa he
 For example, 'char' has a letter which has aa vertex and f and r sound
 kisi bhi shabdaansh main ek 'shabdaansh centre' hota he, jo hameshaa swar varna hi hota he or uske ird-gird anya varna milte hai jo vyanjan bhi ho sakate hai or swar bhi

 manthan karte samay mandarachal rasaatal ko jane laga to vishnu ne kacchap ke rup main apni peeth par dhaaran kiya or devdanvon ne samudr se amrit evam lakshmi sahit 14 ratnon kii prapti karke purvawat vaibhav sampadit kiya
 The fast of Ekadashi became popular only after Kachhapavatar in the world
 kurmpurana main vishnu ne apane kachmpavataar main rishiyon se jivan ke chaar lakshyon kii varnan kiya tha
 Seeing the valor of Devraj Indra, the sage Durvasa presented him with a garland of Parijat flowers but Indra, not accepting it, put on Airavat and threw it on the ground, Durvasa got angry with it and cursed the gods, their gods
 But due to the curse, the gods lost their power
 isse atyant niraash hokar ve brahma ke paas maargdarshan ke liye pahunche
 He asked the gods to approach Lord Vishnu
 vishnu ne unhen yah salaah di ki ve ksheer samudr kaa manthan karen jisase amrit milegi
 By drinking this nectar, the power of the Gods will return and they will become immortal forever
 is vishaal kaary ko mandar parvat or vasuki ke sahare se hi kiya ja saktaa tha, jahaan parvat ko mathini kaa danda or vasuki ko rassi ke samaan upyog kiya gaya
 This work also required the support of the Asuras and due to this all the gods became terrorized
 lekin vishnu ne unako samajhaayaa or asur devon ke poochhne par unki madad karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye, amrit ke laalach main
 They started churning the sea, where there were demons on one side and Gods on the other side
 lekin is manthan karne se ek ghaatak jehar nikalne lagi jisase ghutan hone lagi or sari duniya par khatra aa gaya
 But Lord Mahadev came to the rescue and took the poison and retained it in his throat which gave him the name Neelkanth

 Then Lord Vishnu incarnated a huge turtle incarnated in the avatar of Kurma to beat the mountain and lift it

 Other prizes like Kamadhenu appeared from the sea and Dhanvatari with nectar kalash in his hands

 chandragupta hindi ke prasiddh naatakkaar jaishankar prasad kaa pramukh naatak he
 In this, the theme of India's struggle with foreigners and the victory of India in that conflict has been raised
 prasad ji ke man main bharat kii gulaami ko lekar gahari vyathaa thi
 Through this historical context, he has expressed his belief

 Its narrative lacks the organization, balance and monotony that 'skandagupta' has

 The development of characters has also not been done properly
 phir bhi ‘chandragupta’ hindi kii ek shreshth natyakruti he, prasad ji kii pratibha ne isaki trutiyon ko dhank diya he
 'chandragupta' is a drama written by Jai Shankar Prasad ji, which is a very well-known book in the field of Hindi literature
 yah naatak maury samrajya ke sansthaapak ‘chandragupta maury’ ke utthan kii katha natya rup main kahata he
 The play tells the story of the rise of 'chandragupta Maurya' as well as the fall of 'dhanananda', the king of the then superpower kingdom 'magadha'
 yah naatak ‘chanakya’ ke pratishodh or vishwaas kii kahani bhi kahata he
 The play also tells the story of politics, diplomacy, conspiracy, ambush-retaliation, malice, hatred, ambition, sacrifice and national love

 The play also tells the story of love and the sacrifices made for love

 Many foreign and native writers have written a lot on 'chandragupta' and 'chanakya'
 alag-alag prakaar kii kahaniyaan or unase nikalne vaala alag-alag prakaar kaa nichod man main bhram paidaa karne ke liye kaaphi he
 However, this play is somewhat different from all books
 jo pathak is naatak ko padhnaa chaahate hai unke liye mahatvapurn salaah yah kii naatak se pehle isaki bhoomika jarur padhein
 The kind of research that Jai Shankar Prasad has done to write the role of this play is capable while i think there is no word for praise
 lagbhag sabhi deshi or videshi lekhakon ke pustakon se mahatavpurn binduon ko uthaakar unhone chandragupta ke janm se lekar uske rajbhishek tak kii gatividhiyon ko alag-alag rup se prastut kiya he
 The role of this drama itself is nothing short of a research paper
 jo itihaas kaa postmortem unhone apni is bhoomika main sabhi deshi-videshi itihaaskaar dwaara likhit pustakon kaa adhyayan karke, sabhi kaa riference dekar tulana karte hue ‘chandragupta’ se sambandhit har prakaar kii ghatana ko ullekith kiya he, vah kahin or aapako dekhne ko nahin milegaa
 The presentation of the play and the simple Hindi language used in it make this play readable
 vahin naatak ke bich-bich main kai geet aise hai jo aapke dil main sadaa ke liye bas jane icchhuk hote hai
 He has been successful in portraying the beauty and character of each character
 saath hi ghatnaon ko ek hi dhaage main pirone se yah naatak padhne main romaanchak ho chalaa he
 i wish that sometime in the future, i can also see its theatrical staging so that i can live it fully
 is naatak or bhoomika main seekhney ke liye bahut kuch he
 The role helps to remove all the dust that has accumulated on your mind which came from reading many books based on 'chandragupta and Chanakya'
 bhoomika ek prakaar se is vishay par banaaya gaya vah mishran he jise pine ke baad yaa yun kahoon padhne ke baad hosh main aa jate hai
 At the same time, we learn a lot by watching different forms of human beings in the drama
 chanakya ke kai nitiyon ko ham aasaani se naatak main dekh sakate hai or shiksha praapt kar sakate hai
 This composition of Jai Shankar Prasad is truly an enlightening and entertaining book which readers of all categories must read
 marathon lambii duuri kii daud pratiyogita he jisaki aadhikarik duuri 42
195 kilometre he, yah aamtaur par sadak daud ke taur par daudi jaati he
 The race was set up in commemoration of the race from the Battle of Marathon to Athens as a runner of the Greek soldier Phidippidis
 is kinvadanti kii sachai main shaq he, herrodotus ke vrittant main khaas taur par virodhabhas miltaa he
 The marathon was a unique race in the 1896 Olympic Games, although the standardization of the distance was only until 1921

 Big marathons can also have tens of thousands of runners
 marathon naam fedipidis naamak unani dhaavak kii kinvadanti se aayaa he
 Legend says that he was sent from Marathon to Athens to declare that the Persians had been defeated in the Battle of Marathon, this BC
 The 490s took place in August or September
 kaha jaataa he ki vah puure raste bina ruke dauda or phir sabha main pravesh karke bolaa "νενικήκαμεν" or phir gir padaa or mar gaya
 The first account of the race from Marathon to Athens is found in Plutarch's Athens Kirti, which was written in the first century, and refers to the runner's name Archaeus or Theresipus of Eucals, referring to the extinct work of Heraclidus Ponticus
 samosaata kaa lusian bhi yahi katha varnit karti he par dhaavak kaa naam philippidis bataati he The truth of this legend is controversial
 unani-farsi yudhon ke pramukh strot, unani itihaaskaar herrodotus, fedipidis ko ek harkare ke rup main varnit karte hai jo madad kaa sandesh le ke athens se sparta or waapas gaye, yah duuri ekatarfa 240 kilometre se bhi zyaada he
 In some Herodotus manuscripts, the runner who ran between Athens to Sparta is named Phylippidis
 herrodotus marathon se athens bheje jane vaale ki si harkare kaa varnan nahin karata he or yah kahata he ki athens kii sena kaa mukhya bhaag, yuddh jeetne ke baad farsi nausena kii ore se athens par hamalaa hone ke dar se turant waapas athens pahunch gaye the or usee din waapas aa gaye the
 In 1879, Robert Browning wrote a poem called Phidippidis
 
 browning kii kavita or uske varnit gaatha unnisvin sadi kii samskruti kaa hissaa ban gai or aitihaasik kinvadanti ke rup main sweekrut ho gai
 The Pentelico Mountains lie between Marathon and Athens, meaning that if Fedepidis had actually run after the war, he would have had to leave the mountainside - north or south

 This route is about 42 kilometers and this is the standard length of this race in the modern era

 This path is a little shorter, some 35 kilometers, but it has a much harder climb in the beginning, which is 5 kilometers in length
 aadhunik olympic kaa vichaar jab 19veen sadi ke ant main vaastaviktaa bana to aayojak ise lokapriy banane ke liye pracheen yunaan ke gaurav ke jariye ise lokapriy karne ke tareeke khoj rahe the
 The idea of organizing a marathon race came from Michel Breyal who wanted to include it in the first modern Olympic Games of Athens in 1896

 yahi manamaani si lagati duuri landan ke 1908 greeshm olympic ke marathon ke liye lagu hui
 At the May 1907 meeting of the International Olympic Committee in The Hague, it was agreed with the British Olympic Association that the 1908 Olympics would also include marathon races of some 25 miles or 40 kilometers

 There was little opposition to the lay of the last few miles as there were tram trails and boulders, so the wormwood scrubs passed through its rough path

 The decision to start the race 700 yards away from the statue of Queen Victoria near the Fort of Windsor was extended even further

 The race for the official Trial Marathon of 25 April 1908 organized by Polytechnic Harriers began with 'the Long Walk', a spectacular shady route leading to the grounds of Windsor Great Park at Windsor Fort

 "the huge crowd, Queen Alexandria Samante, saw this little Italian Dorando Pietri falling, rolling and slipping several times in the last 385 yards, eventually being escorted by the authorities to the end of the race, and in the meantime, irish-american Johnny Hays kept coming closer and closer

 But Queen Alexander was so distracted by Dorando's condition that the next day he presented her with a silver cup

 World records were not officially recognized by the IAAF until January 1, 2004; previously, the best times for the marathon were referred to as the 'world best'
 Courses must conform to IAAF standards for a record to be recognized
 However, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible
 Typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters
 The world record time for men over the distance is 2 hours 3 minutes and 59 seconds, set in the Berlin Marathon by Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia on September 28, 2008, an improvement of 51 minutes and 19 seconds since Johnny Hayes' gold medal performance at the 1908 Summer Olympics
 Gebrselassie's world record represents an average pace of under 2:57 per kilometre, average speed of over 20
4 km / h 
 The world record for women was set by Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain in the London Marathon on April 13, 2003, in 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds
 This time was set using male pacesetters; the fastest time by a woman without using a male pacesetter was also set by Paula Radcliffe, again during the London Marathon, with a time of 2 hours 17 minutes and 42 seconds, on April 17, 2005
 According to IAAF statistics, these men and women are the ten fastest in the marathon distance
 Most participants do not run a marathon to win
 More important for most runners is their personal finish time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish
 Strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance and a run-walk strategy
 In 2005, the average marathon time in the U
S
 was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women
 Another goal people can aim for is to break certain time barriers
 For example, entertaining first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours
 Other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons
 The Boston Marathon, the oldest marathon in the United States, requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners
 The New York City marathon also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry, at a pace slightly faster than Boston's
 a qualifying time is also needed for Washington dc's National Marathon
 However, unlike Boston, where the qualifying times serve to attract a more talented field and limit participation, the National Marathon is motivated more by the need to reopen city streets in a limited amount of time
 marathon prashikshan main lambii daud ek ahm chiz he
 Amateur runners usually try to run a maximum of 20 miles and try to run some 40 miles throughout the week, but in fact exercisers often do not
 adhik anbhavi marathoni zyaada lambii duuri yaa hafte bhar main adhik kilometre daud sakate hai
 More weekly training kilometers give better results in terms of distance and capacity, but also increases the chance of injury in training
 Most male elite marathon runners will have weekly mileages of over 100 miles 
 Many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally a little decrease for recovery
 The decrease, commonly called the taper, should last a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of three weeks, according to most trainers
 For beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of 4 months of running 4 days a week is recommended
 Many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10%
 It is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses
 The marathon training program itself would suppose variation between the hard and the easy training, with a periodization of the general plan
 Training programs may be found at Runner's World, Hal Higdon, Jeff Galloway, Boston Athletic Association and from numerous other sources
 Overtraining is a condition that results from not getting enough rest to allow the body to recover from stressful training
 It can result in lowered endurance and speed and place a runner at a greater risk of injury
 During the last two or three weeks before the marathon, runners will typically reduce their weekly training, gradually, by as much as 50%-75% of previous peak volume, and take at least a couple of days of complete rest to allow their bodies to recover from any strong effort
 The last long training run might be undertaken no later than two weeks prior to the event
 This is a phase of training known as tapering
 Many marathon runners also "carbo-load" during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen
 Immediately before the race, many runners will refrain from eating solid food to avoid digestive problems
 They will also ensure that they are fully hydrated beforehand
 Light stretching before the race is believed by many to help keep muscles limber
 Some runners will wear an ice vest before the race to reduce their core temperature so as to avoid overheating later in the race
 Coaches recommend trying to maintain as steady a pace as possible when running a marathon
 Some advise novice runners to start out slower than their average goal pace to save energy for the second half of the race 
 As an example, the first five to eight miles might be run at a pace 15–20 seconds per mile slower than the target pace for later
 Typically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer
 Modern marathons such as New York, Chicago, London and Berlin have tens of thousands of runners and millions of spectators
 Common courtesy for other runners becomes necessary when running in a densely packed crowd
 Those employing a walk / run strategy or who are simply walking are encouraged to stay to one side, leaving the middle of the street for faster runners
 Runners in groups are encouraged not to block the entire street, preventing other runners from passing them
 Two or three runners abreast is recommended
 Large groups may consider single or double files
 Many marathons around the world have a time limit by which all runners must have crossed the finish line
 Anyone slower than that will be picked up by the sweeper bus
 In many cases the marathon event organization is required to re-open the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal
 Refusing to get on the bus could cause traffic hazards and would embarrass the organization
 While drinking fluids during the race is important for all runners, in some cases too much drinking can also be dangerous
 Drinking more than one loses during a race can decrease the concentration of sodium in the blood, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death
 Eating salt packets during a race mitigates this problem
 The International Marathon Medical Directors Association issued a warning in 2001 that urged runners only to drink when they are thirsty, rather than "drinking ahead of their thirst
" Women are more prone to hyponatremia than men
 a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 13% of runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon had hyponatremia
 a 4+ hour runner can drink about 4-6 fluid ounces every 20–30 minutes without fear of hyponatremia
 Consuming sports drinks or salty snacks will also reduce the risk
 a patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in blood
 Some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs
 If anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water
 Carbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage
 Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy
 Runners can store about 8 MJ or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30 km / 18–20 miles of running
 Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point
 When glycogen runs low, the body must then burn stored fat for energy, which does not burn as readily
 When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to "hit the wall"
 The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches, is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the "wall" is not as dramatic
 This is in part accomplished by utilizing a higher percentage of energy from burned fat even during the early phase of the race, thus conserving glycogen
 Carbohydrate-based "energy" gels are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of "hitting the wall", as they provide easy to digest energy during the run
 Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine
 They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water
 Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely
 Alternatives to gels are solid candy, cookies, other forms of concentrated sugars, or any food high in simple carbohydrates which can be digested easily by the individual runner
 Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them
 Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick
 Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race
 It's also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers, as these drugs change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to serious kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration
 Marathon participation may result in various medical, musculoskeletal, and dermatological complaints
 Delayed onset muscle soreness is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon
 Various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to DOMS
 Dermatological issues often include "jogger's nipple", "jogger's toe", and blisters
 The immune system is reportedly suppressed for a short time
 Changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction
 After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended
 In addition, soaking the lower half of the body for 20 minutes or so in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery
 a study published in 1996 found that the risk of having a fatal heart attack during, or in the period 24 hours after a marathon, was approximately 1 in 50,000 over an athlete's racing career—which the authors characterised as an "extremely small" risk
 The paper went on to say that since the risk was so small, cardiac screening programs for marathons were not warranted
 However, this study was not an attempt to assess the overall benefit or risk to cardiac health of marathon running
 In 2006, a study of 60 non-elite marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins which caused heart damage or dysfunction after they had completed the marathon, and gave them ultrasound scans before and after the race
 The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had done less than 35 miles per week training before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than 45 miles per week training beforehand showed few or no heart problems
 In 2007, Ryan Shay, a 28 year-old elite long-distance runner, died after collapsing early in the US Olympic marathon trials
 His death was reported as probably due to a pre-existing heart abnormality
 As marathon running has become more popular, some athletes have accomplished to complete goals involving the running of a series of marathons
 In the United States, a popular goal is to run a marathon in each state plus Washington, D
C

 Over 350 individuals have completed this circuit once and some have done it eight times
 In 2004, Chuck Bryant of Miami, Florida, who lost his right leg below the knee, became the first amputee to finish this circuit
 Bryant has completed a total of 59 marathons on his prosthesis
 Twenty-seven people have run a marathon on each of the seven continents, and 31 people have run a marathon in each of the Canadian provinces
 In 1980, in what was termed the Marathon of Hope, Terry Fox, who had lost a leg to cancer and so ran with one artificial leg, attained 5,373 kilometre of his proposed cross-canada cancer fundraising run, thus maintaining an average of over 37 kilometre, close to the planned marathon distance, for each of 143 consecutive days
 On February 8, 2009, John Wallace claimed to become the first person to run marathons in 100 different countries
 However, some of his runs were not official races but individual runs over the marathon distance ; furthermore some of his 'countries' are not independent 
 Previously, Wally Herman had run marathons in 99 different countries
 In 2003 British adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes completed seven marathons on seven continents in seven days
 He completed this feat despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double heart bypass operation just four months before
 On December 14, 2008, 64-year old Larry Macon set a record by running 105 marathons in a single calendar year
 On September 15, 2009, comedian Eddie Izzard, at the age of 47, completed his 43rd marathon in 51 days which had taken him around the United Kingdom
 This feat was completed to boost donations to the UK charity Sport Relief
 Before starting his running, Eddie trained for just seven weeks
 In Europe a goal among some people is to run the greatest number of marathon races overall in one's lifetime
 There is something called the 100-club, for example
 To qualify one must have run 100 races
 Other goals are to attempt to run marathons on a series of successive weekends, or to run the most marathons during a particular year or the most in a lifetime
 a pioneer in running multiple marathons was Sy Mah of Toledo, Ohio, who ran 524 before he died in 1988
 John Bozung, a runner based in the Utah area, claims to have the current "unofficial" record for having run 258 marathons in 170 success months as of November 2007
 As of June 30, 2007, Horst Preisler of Germany had successfully completed 1214 marathons plus 347 ultramarathons, a total of 1561 events at marathon distance or longer
 Sigrid Eichner, Christian Hottas and hans-joachim Meyer have also all completed over 1000 marathons each
 Norm Frank of the United States is credited with 945 marathons
 In 2010, Stefaan Engels, a Belgian, set out to run a marathon every day of the year
 Although he finished some with a handbike, due to an injury, he broke the existing record of Akinori Kusuda, from Japan, who ran 52 marathons in 52 days
 Engels ran and biked 233 marathons in the first 233 days
 Some runners compete to run the same marathons for the most consecutive years
 For example, Johnny Kelley completed 61 Boston Marathons
 Four runners, dubbed the "ground pounders", have completed all 32 US Marine Corps Marathons
 Another mention for most consecutive marathons is Jerald Fenske, who has completed every Paavo Nurmi Marathon he has entered since his first in 1978 at age 17, a total of 33 consecutive finishes through 2010
 saanchaa:athletics eventssazca:racing Mithila was a kingdom in ancient India
 mana jaataa he ki yah vartmaan uttari bihar or nepal kii tarai kaa ilaaka he jise mithila ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 The folklore of Mithila has been going on for many centuries, which is known for its intellectual tradition outside India and India
 is kshetra kii pramukh bhashaa maithili he
 In Hindu religious texts, the first indication of this is found in Shatapatha Brahmin and explicit mention in Valmiki Ramayana
 mithila kaa ullekh mahabharat, ramayana, puraana tathaa jain evam buddha granthon main hua he
 According to mythological references, Mithila is the most ancient name of this region; Also it has been addressed by the name Videha
 tirbhukti naam praapt ullekhon ke anusaar apekshaakrit kaaphi baad kaa siddh hota he
 The most ancient connection of naming Videha and Mithila connects with Videha Mathava mentioned in Shatapatha Brahmana
 mithila ke basane ke aarambhik samay kaa sanket ukt katha main praapt hota he
 Videgh Mathava and his priest Gautam Rahugan walked east from the arrow of the river Saraswati
 unke aage-aage agni vaishwanar nadiyon kaa jal sukhaate hue chal rahe the
 Agni could not dry the Sadanira river and on being asked by Videgh Mathava where my residence is now, Agni replied that you live on the east side of this river
 shatapath brahman main spasht roopen ullikhit he ki pehle brahman log is nadi ko paar nahin karte the tathaa yahan kii bhoomi upjau nahin thi
 There was a lot of swamp in it because Agni Vishwanar did not taste it
 parantu ab yah bahut upjau he kyonki brahmanon ne yajna karke uskaa aswadan agni ko kara diya he
 It is also mentioned about the Gandaki river that in the later days of summer, that is, during the summer months, this river flows a lot
 is videgh shabd se videh kaa tathaa maathav shabd se mithila kaa sambandh prathit hota he
 In the Shatapath itself, the word Videha is also mentioned explicitly, referring to the Gandaki River
 vahaan kaha gaya he ki ab tak yah nadi kosal or vidah deshon ke bich kii seemaa he; tathaa is bhoomi ko maathav kii santan kaha gaya he
 In Valmiki Ramayana and various Puranas, the name Mithila has been associated with Mithi, son of King Nimi
 newnaadhik antaron ke saath in granthon main ek katha sarvatra praapt he ki nimi ke mrit sharir ke manthan se mithi kaa janm hua tha
 Valmiki Rama Yana mentions the descendants of Mithi as Maithil whereas in the mythological texts it is said that the settlement of Mithila is done by Mithi itself
 shabdaantaron se yah baat anek granthon main kahi gayi he ki swatah janm lene ke kaaran unka naam janak hua, videh pita se utpann hone ke kaaran ve vaideh kahalaaye tathaa manthan se utpann hone ke kaaran unka naam mithi hua
 Thus, the name of the state ruled by him has been considered Videha and Mithila
 mahabharat main pradesh kaa naam 'mithila' tathaa iske shaskaon ko 'videhavansheey' kaha gaya he
 Both Mithila and arrowheads have been called in the mithila-mahatmya of the Brihadvishnupurana
 mithi ke naam se mithila tathaa anek nadiyon ke tir par sthit hone se tiron main bhoga hone se tirbhukti naam maane gayi hai
 In this book, the position of the main 15 rivers in Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been considered and their names have also been counted
 mithila kaa mahatmaya batalaate hue vrihadvishnu puraana ke mithila-mahatmaya khand main kaha gaya he ki ganga se himalay ke bich 15 nadiyon se yukt param pavitra tirbhukti he
 This arrowhead is Mithila Sita's Nimikanan, the field of knowledge and the back of grace
 janaki ki yah janmabhumi mithila nishpapa or nirpeksha he
 It is pleasing to Rama and Mangaladayini
 prayag aadi tirth lokon main punya dene vaali he parantu ram kii prapti karwaane main samarth nahin he; parantu yah mithila sab prakaar se nishchit rup se ram ko tusht karne vaali hone se vishesh he
 Just as Saket is a form due to the city of the world, similarly Mithila is the cause of all bliss
 isliye maharshigan samast parigrahon ko chhodkar ram kii aradhana ke liye prayatnpurvak yaheen nivas karte hai
 Dev-powers like Srisavitri and Srigauri took this birth
 swayan sarveshvareshvari shrisita ji kii janmabhumi yah mithila ytnpurvak vaas karne se samast siddhiyon ko dene vaali he
 In the Mahabharata, the position of Mithila has been considered after Magadha
 shrikrishna, arjuna tathaa bhim kii magadh-yatra kaa varnan karte hue pehle sarayu nadi paar karke purvi koshal pradesh tathaa phir mahashon, gandki tathaa sadanira ko paar karke mithila main jane kaa ullekh hua he
 It is said that once again crossing the Ganges and the Mahashon to Magadha
 isse spasht prathit hota he ki us samay magadh ke uttar main mithila kii hi sthiti maani gayi he
 The kingdom of Vajji was included only under Mithila
 mahabharat ke is ullekh main bhi mithila ke seemaa kshetra ke bare main anyatra ullikhit pashchim main gandaki tathaa dakshin main ganga tak ke kshetra yathavat sanketit hote hai
 Mentioning the boundary of Mithila in the Brihadvishnupurana clearly states that- arthath purv main kosi se aarambh hokar pashchim main gandaki tak 24 yojan tathaa dakshin main ganga nadi se aarambh hokar uttar main himalay van tak 16 yojan mithila kaa vistaar he
 Mahakavi Chanda Jha has written the above mentioned verses as Maithili, while explaining the extent of Mithila
 is prakaar ullikhit seemaa ke antargat vartmaan main nepal ke tarai pradesh ke saath bihar rajya ke pashchimi champaran, purvi champaran, shivahar, sitamarhi, mujffarpur, vaishali, samastipur, begusarai, darbhanga, madhubani, supaul, madhepura, saharsa, or khagadiya jile kaa praayah puraa bhubhag tathaa bhagalpur jile kaa aanshik bhubhag aata he
 This range is according to ancient mentions, possibly due to the immense fame and uncontrolled spread of Kosi, the eastern border has been considered as Kosi
 band banane se purv kosi kaa koi niyat maarg nahin rahaa he
 Koshi is a book from all areas of eastern Bihar
 atah mahananda nadi se pashchim arthath pashchim bengal aarambh hone se pehle kaa puraa purvi bihar mithilanchal kaa hi swaabhaavik bhaag rahaa he
 The state of the 15 major rivers under Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been reported in the Vriddhivasupurana
 unke naam is prakaar hai:- These are the names of the relatively larger rivers then; But in addition to these, many small rivers in Mithilanchal flow continuously from ancient times till today and are making the name of 'mithila' arrowhead
 shriram-sita se sambandhit vishesh sthaan hone ke atirikt mithila devadhidev mahadev ke pujan-sthal ke rup main vishesh prasiddh rahi he
 According to the great Vishnupuran, the names of the major Shivalingas herein are as follows: - mithila parikrama ke kram main simavarti shivlingon kaa ullekh karte hue singheshwar mahadev tathaa kameshwar ling kaa naam atyadhik shraddha purvak liya gaya he
 Thus the names of the eleventh Shivlingas are enumerated here
 purv main singheshwar mahadev ko pranaam kar parikrama aarambh karne tathaa punah ghumkar singheshwar mahadev ke paas pahunchakar niyam-vidhi purna karke hi ghar jane kii baat kahi gayi he
 • Janakpur ghoghia, dvaarahaat tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Geometry or geometry is one of the three huge branches of mathematics
 isamen binduon, rekhaon, talon or thos chizon ke gunaswabhaav, maapan or unke antariksh main saapekshik sthiti kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Geometry is one of the oldest branches of knowledge
 jyamiti ganit kii vah shakha he jisamen binduon, rekhaon, vakron, samatalon ityadi kaa adhyayan hota he
 This science originated from land-related tasks, hence this mathematics is also called Bhumiti
 armbh main yah adhyayan rekhaon tathaa rekhaon se ghire kshetron ke gunon tak hi simit rahaa, jiske kaaran jyamiti kaa naam rekhganit bhi he The construction of Yajnavedis in India attracted the attention of mathematicians to the study of geometry, their study was more akin to field committee
 itihashyagyon kaa mat he ki bharatvasi isa se 1,000 varsh purv aise sambandh jaise 32 + 42 = 52 jaanate the, parantu aise hi katipay chhutput samikarnon ke atirikt unhone aise sambandhon kaa kisi vyapak rup se adhyayan nahin kiya
 About 600 years before Christ, the Roman mathematician Pithgauras studied this relationship in a logical manner and stated that the square on the hypotenuse in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares above the other arms
 vaise to jyamiti kaa adhyayan sabhi puraane sabhy deshon, jaise misr, babilonia, china, bharat tathaa yunaan, main lagbhag saath hi saath aarambh hua, parantu jitani unnati is vigyaan main yunaan ne kii utani kisi or desh ne nahin kii
 About 300 years before Christ, Euclid, a mathematician from Greece, sorted all the facts that were known by that time in a very logical manner
 gyaat tathyon ke aadhaar par usne anya tathy siddh karne kaa praytn kiya
 In this way, on sorting the facts, he reached some preliminary facts which are difficult to prove
 vaise ve bilkul spasht prathit hote hai
 These facts are so simple that Euclid accepted them as axiomatic and called them facts themselves
 inhen tathyon par jyamiti ke pramayon kaa pramaan nirbhar he
 Those facts are the following: 1
 ve vastuen, jo ek hi vastu ke baraabar hon, aapas main bhi baraabar hoti hai
 2
 If equal items are added to equal items then the sum is equal
 3
 yadi baraabar vastuon main se baraabar vastuen gata di jaayan to sheshfal baraabar hote hai
 4
 Equals equal to equal objects
 5
 yadi do rekhaon ko teesri rekha kaate or ek ore ke ant:konon kaa yoga do samakon se kam ho to jidhar jod kam he udhar hi donon rekhaayen badhaai jane par ek bindu par milengi
 6
 Similarly in creation, you can also create from one composition to another, but in the end we reach some such compositions, whose use does not depend on other experiments
 in rachanaaon ko bhi swayan prayog maanakar hi aage bad sakate hai
 They inke atirikt ve koi or tathy bina siddh kiye hue sweekaar nahin karte
 Four of the above five facts themselves are so simple and clear that proving them is equivalent to proving your hand, but the fifth does not seem to be axiomatic
 ganitagyon ne is tathy ko swayansiddh maanane main aapatti kii or ise siddh karne ke bahut ytn kiye
 These efforts resulted in great inventions
 isi prakaar jyamiti main nae nae paribhaashik shabdon kaa ullekh hota he
 The definition of one word depends on the definition of other words
 ant main dekhte hai ki ye paribhaashaayen bindu, rekha or tal kii paribhaashaon par aadhaarit hai
 According to Euclid, the plane is one in which the length is the width, but the thickness is not
 bahut se log is paribhaasha par bhi andeh karne lage hai, parantu thodaa manan karne se yah spasht ho jayega ki paribhaasha thik he
 For example, if two liquids are filled in a glass vessel that do not meet each other, then when they become stable then we will see that one plane separates the two substances
 usamen motaai nahin he
 If it were, there would be a space between the two fluids that neither contained the substance below nor the top, but it is impossible
 is udhaaharan se spasht ho gaya hoga ki tal main motaai nahin hoti
 It only has length and width
 isi prakaar dhoop main kisi samtal diwaar kii chaaya dekhakar ham kah sakate hai ki rekha main chaudaai nahin hoti
 The line is located in the plane, so the thickness of the floor is the thickness of the line
 isaliye rekha main na motaai hoti he na chaudaai, keval lambaai hi hoti he
 If the lines meet at a point, then the width of the line is the length of the point, that is, there is neither length, nor width, thickness in the point
 keval sthaan hi hota he
 Everyone will be aware that in geometry, the properties of triangles, squares, circles, cones, cylinders, etc
, are studied
 un prashnon ke halon ne bahut vichaarvardhan kiya, isamen koi shankaa nahin, jaise aisa ghan bananaa jiskaa ghanfal die ghan kaa duguna ho
 At that time, the meaning of composition was understood to be composed with the help of tracks and compasses
 doosraa prashn tha aisa varg bananaa jiskaa kshetrafal die hue vrutt ke kshetrafal ke baraabar ho
 The third question was to divide a given angle into three equal parts
 yah kaam patari or parkaar se asambhav he, parantu anya upayon se ho saktaa he
 These questions kept mathematicians busy for centuries
 inke vivechan se ganitjgat kaa bahut laabh pahunchaa, isamen koi andeh nahin
 The Greeks also studied the properties of the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola curve formed by cutting a cone from a plane
 in adhyayanon ne capalan ko apane niyam gyaat karne main badi sahaayta di hogi
 Until the 15th century, geometry was often the study of measurement properties, but after that, properties were also studied which do not depend on measurement; For example, if the vertices of two triangles are on a three pointed line, the corresponding sides meet on a line
 is saadhy ne ganitagyon kaa dhyaan ek anya prakaar kii jyamiti kii ore aakrisht kiya jise prakshepiy jyamiti kehete hai
 If we pay attention to the picture of a scene, we feel that by seeing it, we get complete knowledge of the scene
 parantu chitra main vrutt vrutt nahin rahata, na sabhi samaantar rekhaayen samaantar rahati he, na samakon samakon hi, balki kabhi samakon nune kone dikhaai detaa he, kabhi adhik kone; phir bhi drishy main kuch aise gun he ki akritiyon ke badalane par bhi chitra se unka puraa gyaan hota he
 These qualities are called invesure
 aise hi gunon kaa prakshepiy jyamiti main adhyayan hota he
 Suppose a point b and a quadrilateral KB are dotted
 yadi bindu ba se chaturbhuj ke prayek bindu ko milaanevaali rekhaayen khinchi jaayan or unhen badha den or phir ek samtal se in rekhaon ko kaaten to is tal par ek chitra banegaa
 That trajectory of this quadrilateral and this experiment will be called the relative transformation of point B
 isi prakaar doosraa bindu lekar uske saapeksh is prakshep kaa bhi prakshep nikaal sakate hai
 The properties that do not change are studied by interpolation into a simple polygon
 ye gun mul bahubhuj ke liye bhi thik honge
 Also, many conversions are similar to a conversion experiment
 in prayogon kaa bhi adhyayan is jyamiti kaa ang he
 If the center of a sphere or circle is a and the radius is the radius and if a point b is distance from the center a and if r is the second point in the line b at a distance, where r 1 is the second then then any point of b is There will also be a path to compatible b
 ba' kaa path ba ke path kaa pratilomon kehalaata he
 The aim of this branch is to study every area of inversion
 euclid kaa 5vaan swayansiddh tathy upar diya ja chukaa he
 Mathematicians were never ready to consider it as axiomatic, but they tried very hard to prove it; But no satisfactory answer was found
 anusandhan ke falswaroop ganit kaa bahut vikaas hua or ek aisi jyamiti kaa avishkaar hua jisane jyamiti main purna kranti utpann kar di
 Euclid did all the discussions on the plane itself, but now there are different discussions on each type of plane
 iskaa vivechan kathin he, at: iske liye pathak is vishay kii vishesh pustakon kaa avlokan karen
 In the middle of the 17th century, the French mathematician Decart made it very powerful by using algebra in geometry
 usne pehle do katati hui rekhaayen leen, jinhen aksh kehete hai
 The distance measured in parallel to these lines of a point is determined by its number or two
 ye rekhaayen bindu ke nirdeshaank kehalaati hai
 With the help of these coordinates each geometric fact can be represented by an algebraic equation
 is jyamiti kaa kai dishaao main vikaas hua
 In the first case, a broader form of geometry emerged, such that the equation of an exponent represents a simple line
 isi prakaar do ghaat kaa sameekaran ek shankav pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equations of powers three, four and higher began to be studied and the properties of their corresponding curves became much simpler than before
 tal ke vakron tak hi nahin, avkaash ke vakron kaa bhi adhyayan sambhav ho gaya
 For this, the points of a point from a three-point plane are determined by its distance and represent each point along an equation in Y, R, L
 in samikarnon ke vivechan se talon ore vakron ke gunon kaa adhyayan saralata se hota he
 In the other direction, the solution of composition related questions and activities became very simple
 ye kriyaayein keval kuch samikarnon ke hal par hi nirbhar hai, jisamen bahut vyapak prashn saralata se hal ho jate hai; jaise yadi rekha kisi vakr = o ko katati he, to in donon samikarnon ke hal unke kataan binduon kaa sthaan nishchit karenge
 If the origin of these equations is real, the line cuts the curve
 yadi baraabar hai to rekha vakr ko sparsh karti he
 If imaginary, the line does not intersect the curve, but we can say that the line will always cut the curve at two points, whether the points are real or coincident, or imaginary
 isi prakaar se tathy bade vyapak rup main die ja sakate hai, jo saadhaaran jyamiti main sambhav nahin tha
 In the third direction, coordinate geometry broadened the dimension
 do sankhyaayein ya, r do vimitiyon main tathaa teen sankhyaayein teen vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karti hai
 Now, the question arose in front of mathematicians as to what the four numbers Y, R, L, and the five numbers Y, R, L, V, would represent
 ganitagyon ne to amoort rup se apane mastishk main badi aasaani se soch liya ki chaar sankhyaayein chaar vimitiyon main or paanch sankhyaayein paanch vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karengi
 In this way, he also thought well of the anomalies
 unhen isse koi matlab nahin ki parthiv jagat main uskaa koi udhaaharan he yaa nahin
 Einstein must have used this idea in his theory of relativity and clarified the idea of aversion
 ab is ucch vimiti ke vichaar kaa aprayukt ganit main kuch kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main upyog karte hai
 For example, the number of different particles in a moving fluid is represented by seven numbers
 ve hai k, kha, ga, uskaa praarambhik sthaan, tathaa teen veg, jo ya, r, l aksh ke samaantar hon, tathaa samay, yah saat vimiti kaa prashn samajhakar hal ho saktaa he
 In the fourth direction, coordinate geometry generalized numbers and imaginary numbers emerged
 kalpanik bindu tathaa kaalpanik vakr ityadi vichaaron ne jyamiti ko bahut mahatvashaalee bana diya, jisase vyapkikaran main or adhik sahaayta mili, jaise anant par do kaalpanik binduon se janevaala shaankab vrutt hota he, ityadi
 In addition, geometry was discussed with the help of different types of coordinates, such as quadratic coordinates, triangular coordinates, tangent coordinates, etc
 nirdeshaankon ke prayog ke lagbhag 50 varsh baad hi kalan kaa prayog bhi jyamiti main hone laga
 This experiment generated new ideologies in geometry
 inhen hi avakal jyamiti kehete hai
 Brigadier Mohammed Osman, MVC was an Indian military officer martyred in the 1947 india-pakistan war
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke samay unhone kai anya muslim adhikariyon ke saath pakistan sena main jane se inkaar kar diya or bhartiya sena ke saath seva jari rakhi
 He was martyred on 3 July 1948 while fighting Pakistani soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir
 tadoparant unhen dushman ke saamne bahaduree ke liye bharat ke duusare sabase bade sainya padak mahavir chakra se sammanit kiya gaya
 Mohammad Osman was born on 15 July 1912 in Mau district of United Provinces in British India

 At the end of his year with the Cameronians, on 19 March 1935, he was appointed to the Indian Army and was published to the 5th Battalion to the 10th Baloch Regiment
 Later in the year he saw active service on the north-west Frontier during the Mohmand campaign of India in 1935
 He qualified as a 1st class interpreter in Urdu in May 1935
 osman ko padonnat kiya gaya tha ke rank leftinent par 30 april 1936 or captain par 31 agast 1941
 april 1944 main, vah tha ek asthaayee pramukhhai 
 He served in Burma and was mentioned in the Dispatch as a temporary chief in the London Gazette 27 September 1945
 He was commanded from the 10th Baloch Regiment of the 14th Battalion, April 1945 to April 1946 ke dauraan bharat ke vibhaajan, osman, ja rahaa he ek muslim adhikari kii balooch regiment tha, se teevr dabaav ke tahat pakistani netritv karne ke liye chunate ke liye pakistan kii sena

 When Baloch Regiment was allotted to Pakistan, Osman was handed over to Dogra Regiment 1947 main pakistan bheja adivasee irregulars main saamanti rajya ke jammu or kashmir main ek prayaas karne ke liye kabja he or ise sweekaar karne ke liye yah pakistan he 
 Osman, then commanding the 77th Parachute Brigade, was sent in command to the 50 Parachute Brigade, which was stationed at Jhangar in December 1947
 On December 25, 1947, the heavy brigade, against the standing odds, captured Pakistani forces Jhangar
 Coming from the roads located at the junction of Mirpur and Kotli, Jhangar was of strategic importance
 On that day Usman took a fast to recapture Jhangar - an achievement he completed after three months, but at the cost of his own life

 The enemy was finally driven from the area, and Jhangar was recaptured
 Pakistan brought its regular forces into the fray in May 1948
 Jhangar was once again subjected to heavy artillery bombardment, and many determined attacks were launched by Jhangar on the Pakistan Army
 However, Osman frustrated all his efforts to remove it

 It is his 36th birthday less than 12 days
 His last words were, "I am dying but don't know we were fighting for this area to fall enemies"
 His inspiring leadership and great courage, he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously
