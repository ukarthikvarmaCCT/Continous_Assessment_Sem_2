 Trees or vegetation means the vegetative life of an area or plant life on land and is not related to any specific race, form of life, composition, spatial spread, or other botanical or geographical features
 yah shabd flora shabd se kahin adhik bada he jo vishesh rup se jati kii sanrachana se sambadhit hota he
 Probably the closest synonym is the botanical society, but the term plant-plant can refer to a wide range of spatial scales, which include the flora and fauna of the whole world

 The types of vegetation in North America are based on a combination of the following parameters - climate patterns, plant habitats, phenology and / or growth types and dominant species
 The classification in the current US standard is hierarchical and incorporates non-fluorogenic parameters in the upper standards only in the lower two levels
 europe main, vargeekaran akasar bina jalwaayu, phenology yaa vikaas ke swaroopon ke bare main spasht baat kiye, adhiktar or kabhi-kabhi puri tarah floristic sanrachana par nirbhar karata he
 It often emphasizes the symbolic or diagnostic race that distinguishes one type from another
 epaxdisi maanak main, sabase saadhaaran se sabase vishisht, padanukramit str hai – tantra, varg, upvarg, samooh, banaavat, mail or sambandh 
 sabase nichalaa str, yaa sambandh, sabase sahi tareeke se paribhaashit he or ek prakaar kii ek se teen pramukh jatiyon ke naamon kaa samaves karata he
 For example, the definition of a vegetation type at the class level may be "forest, canopy cover> 60%", at the level of texture, "winter rain, broad-leaved, evergreen, sclerophyllous, closed canopy forest"; At the level of Mel, "arbutus Manizi One"; And at the level of the relationship, it is called "'arbutus mengisi - Lithocarpus densiflora forest", which is the Pacific madron-tannoque forest found in California and Origan, USA

 They change at all possible scales
 vanaspati main gatishiltaa ko mukhyatah jati kii sanrachana or / yaa vanaspati rachana ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Occasionally, a variety of processes or events can change, but for ease they can be divided into sudden or slow categories
 achaanak hone vaale parivartan saamanytah updrav kehalaate hai – inamen jangal kii aag, tej hawaaen, bhuskhalan, baadh, himaskhalan jaisi ghatnaayen shaamil hai
 The reasons for these are usually outside the community — these are natural processes that are independent of the natural processes of the community
 aisi ghatnaayen vanaspati rachana or jati kii sanrachana main bahut teji se or lambii samyavadhi ke liye parivartan laa sakati hai or vishaal kshetra ko prabhavit kar sakati hai
 There are very few ecosystems that do not have regular and frequent disturbances and are part of every long-term dynamic mechanism
 aag or hawa ke updrav vishwa bhar main anek vanaspati prakaaron main vishesh rup se aam hai
 Fire is particularly strong because it can destroy not only the living plants but also the seeds, spores and living meristems, which represent the next generation, and the fauna, soil properties and other ecosystems and other ecosystems
 May affect processes
 
 Slow-temporal change is ubiquitous — it contains an area of eccentric rotation

 These modifications alter the most eligible race in any region to grow, survive and breed, leading to changes in the flora
 in floristic parivartanon ke kaaran ve vachanaatmak parivartan hote hai jo paudhe ke vikaas main jati ke parivartanon ke abhaav kii sthiti main bhi swaabhaavik rup se hote hai, jisase vanaspati main dhime or purvagyaat parivartan aate hai
 a rotation can be interrupted at any time by a nuisance that causes the system to return to its former state or to follow a path
 iske kaaran aavarti prakriyaayein kisi sthir, antim dasha main pahanch yaa na pahunch sakati hai
 Furthermore, predicting the properties of such conditions, even if not reduced, is not always possible
 sankshipt main, vanaspati samudaay anek parivartakon par nirbhar hote hai jo milakar bhavishya kii dashaon kii sambhaavnaaon kii simaaen nishchit karte hai
 Botanists study the causes of the types and processes observed in vegetation at different scales of places and times

 Such questions often occur on a large scale and hence cannot be solved easily by using any manipulation
 That is why observational studies are very common in botany, with the help of knowledge of Vannasastra, Paleovanushastra, ecology, soil science etc

 In the United States, Henry Coles and Fredrik Clements developed ideas of vegetative rot in the early 20th century
 klement ab amaanya superarganism ke rup main vanaspati samudaay ke varnan ke liye prasiddh he
 He argued that just as all the organisms in a person work together to help the body work well and which develop together as a person becomes an adult, similarly in the vegetative community, every caste is very closely coordinated and Develops and co-ordinates with synergy and pushes the vegetation community to a defined and predetermined end state
 haalanki klements ne uttari american vanaspati par bahut kaary kiya, superarganism ke prati uski bhakthi ne uski pratishtha ko dhakka pahunchaaya he, kyonki anekon shodhakartaaon dwaara kiye gaye kaary main uske vichaar ko samarthan nahin mila he
 Contrary to Clements, many situational scientists have shown that the individual hypothesis, which states that the vegetation community is the total accumulation of a group of species reacting to the environment, is correct and decreases simultaneously in time and space
 remenski ne rus main yah vichaar prastut kiya or 1926 main henry gliyasana ne united stats main ise ek paper main viksit kiya
 Clementsian ideas had so much influence that Gliasson's ideas were rejected for many years
 lekin 1950 va 60 ke dashakon main rabart whitaker ke achchi tarah se taiyaar kiye gaye adhyayanon kii shrankhla ne gliyasana ke tarkon ke liye majabut saboot pesh kiye

 In studies of three very different montane ecosystems, Whitaker showed that castes react primarily to the environment and have no coordination with other nearby castes
 Other work, particularly on paleobotany, supports this idea over large temporal and spatial scales

 In the functional framework, taxonomy is of little importance and all research focuses on the species' anatomical, anatomical, and anatomical classification, and its purpose is to predict how specific groups will behave toward different environmental variables

 It is generally believed that simple, all-purpose classifications will be replaced by more elaborate and functional classifications
 For this, better understanding of physiology, anatomy and developmental biology will be needed from now on
 This will be necessary for more castes even if the main caste is taken from most of the vegetation castes

 1977 main film ham kisi se kam nahin ke geet kya hua tera vaada ke liye unhe apane jivan kaa chatha tathaa antim film fere eword mila
 Mohammad Rafi was a very devoted Muslim, a man away from addictions and a shy man
 aazaadee ke samay vibhaajan ke dauraan unhone bharat main rahanaa pasand kiya
 He married Begum Wikis and had seven children - four sons and three daughters

 In his early days, he sang for the composer duo laxmikant-pyarelal for very little money
 gaanon kii roylty ko lekar lata mangeshkar ke saath unka vivaad bhi unki dariyaadilii kaa suchak he
 At that time, Lataji said that even after singing the songs, singers and singers should get a part of the income from those songs
 rafi sahab iske kilaaf the or unka kahana tha ki ek baar gane record ho gaye or gayak-gayikaon ko unki fees kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya ho to unako or paison kii aashaa nahin kerani chahie
 There was a conflict between the two great artists about this
 lata ne rafi ke saath set par gane se manaa kar diya or barason tak dono kaa koi yugal geet nahin aayaa
 Later, at the behest of actress Nargis, both of them started singing together and sang Dil Pukare in the Jewel Thief film
 unka dehant 31 july 1980 ko hridaygati ruk janeke kaaran hua
 There is some controversy over how many songs Rafi sang in his life
 1970 ke dashak main gineez book of world ricards ne likhaa ki sabase adhik gane ricard karne kaa shrey lata mangeshkar ko praapt he, jinhone kul 25,000 gane ricard kiye hai
 Rafi wrote a letter to the Guinness Book, refuting it
 iske baad ke sanskarnon main gineez book ne donon gayakon ke daawey saath-saath pradarshit kiye or mohammad rafi ko 1944 or 1980 ke bich 28,000 gane ricard karne kaa shrey diya
 In the subsequent search, Vishwas Nerurkar found that Lata had actually sung only 5,044 songs till 1989
 anya shodhakartaaon ne bhi is tathy ko sahi mana he
 Additionally, Raju Bharatan found that between 1948 and 1987 only 35,000 Hindi songs were recorded
 aise main rafi ne 28,000 gane gaae is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil he, lekin kuch strot ab bhi is sankhya ko uddhrut karte hai
 After this research, in 1992, the Guinness Book removed the above record of singing from the book

 elbinizam, vanshanugat tareeke se ricesive jin elils ko praapt karne ke parinamswaroop hota he or yah maanav sahit sabhi rishadhariyon ko prabhavit karata he
 The most commonly used term for organisms affected by albinism is "meningitis"
 atirikt clinical visheshnon ke tahat kabhi-kabhi jaanwaron ko sanderbhit karne ke liye "elbinoid" or "elbinic" shabdon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Albinism is associated with many vision defects, such as photophobia, nystagmus, and astigmatism
 In the absence of skin pigmentation, organisms are more prone to sunburn and skin cancer
 manushyon main elbinizam kii do mukhya shreniyan hai: Other conditions include albinism as part of their appearance
 inamen harmanski-puddlak syndrome, chadiyak-higashi syndrome, gricelli syndrome, vardenberg syndrome or tietz syndrome shaamil hai
 These conditions are sometimes classified with albinism
 kaiyon ke upaprakaar hote hai
 Some are easily identified by their complexion, but in most cases genetic testing is the only way to accurately identify them
 elbinizam ko pehle tyrosiness-positive yaa -negative ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa tha
 In cases of tyrosinase-positive albinism, the enzyme tyrosinase is present
 melanosite bhinn-bhinn kaarnon main se kisi bhi ek kaaran se melanin kaa nirmaan karne main aksham hoti he, jisamen pratyaksh rup se tyrosiness anzime shaamil na ho
 In cases related to tyrosinase-negative either the tyrosinase enzyme does not form or its nonfunctional form

 Most pigmented humans appear white or absolutely yellow because they do not contain the melanin pigments responsible for the brown, black, and some yellow colors

 The human eye usually produces enough pigment to give color to the iris and the eye gains opacity
 haalanki, aise bhi kuch maamle saamne aate hai jahaan ek elbinistic vyakti kii aankhe laal yaa bangnee dikhaai detii he, jo unamem maujuud ranjak ke pariman par nirbhar karata he
 Lack of pigments or pigments in the eyes also results in problems related to photosensitivities and unrelated vision

 The development of optical systems is largely dependent on the presence of melanin and the lack or absence of this pigment in albinistic organisms can result in the following problems: elbinizam main aam taur par dekhi jane vaali aankh kii dashaon main shaamil hai: The lack of melanin causes some visual problems associated with albinism due to the poorly developed retinal pigment epithelium

 The iris dye is a sphincter made of tissue that shrinks when the eye is exposed to bright light, to protect the retina by limiting the amount of light that passes through the pupil
 kam prakaash sthitiyon main iris aankh main adhik prakaash pravesh karne kii anumati pradaan karne ke liye dhilaa ho jaataa he
 In albinistic subjects the iris does not have enough pigment to block light, thereby reducing the pupil diameter only partially to reduce the amount of light entering the eye
 iske atirikt, arapei kaa anuchit vikaas jo saamaanya aankhon main zyaadaatar paravartit surya ke prakaash ko avashoshit kar letaa he, aankh ke bheetar prakaash ke vikharaav kii vajah se chamak main or vruddhi karata he
 The resulting sensitivity usually results in a feeling of uneasiness in bright light, but this can be reduced by using sunglasses and / or edge caps

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european
 hind europea parivaar kii kai shakhaayen hai
 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches
 sanskrit isi varg main aati he
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans
 ek vichaardhaara ke mutabik aaryon kii janmabhumi madhya asia main thi, shaayad dakshini rus yaa caspian sagar ke aas-paas
 From there his clan reached many countries of the world
 hind-arya kabeelon kaa bhartiya upmahadweep main pravaas dhire-dhire or shantipurvak hua tha or british itihaaskaaron kii "koon-kharabe" vaali baton kaa koi pramaan nahin he
 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought
 ye vichaardhaara aajkal duniya ke adhiktam bhashavid or itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans
 ek duusari vichaardhaara ke anusaar pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bharat hi he or yaheen se arya kabeeley europe or baaki asia main pravaas kiye
 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued
 adhiktar bhashavidon ke anusaar "aadim-hind-europea" bhashaa ke punarnirmit shabd yahi ishaara karte hai ki pracheen arya janmasthan ek vishaal, shitoshna ghaas kaa charaagaah tha
 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc

 vigyaan, prakruti kaa vishesh gyaan he
 Although man has been acquiring knowledge of nature since ancient times, yet science is a product of ancient times
 isi yug main iskaa aarambh hua or thode samay ke bheetar hi isane badi unnati kar lee he
 Thus a huge revolution took place in the world and a new civilization, based on science, was created
 brahmand ke pareekshan kaa samyak tarika bhi dhire-dhire viksit hua
 It is better to do some experiments on it and to inspect it carefully rather than speaking or arguing about anything
 is vidhi ke parinaam is arth main saarvatrik hai ki koi bhi un prayogon ko punah doharaa kar praapt aankadon kii jaanch kar saktaa he
 So far, scientific method is the best among invented methods to separate truth from untruth and confusion
 sankshep main vaigyanik vidhi nimna prakaar se kaary karti he: The biggest feature of any scientific theory or hypothesis is that there should be scope to prove it to be untrue
 jabaki majahabi manyataayen aisi hotin hai jinhe asaty siddh karne kii koi gunjaaish nahin hoti
 For example, 'those who follow the path shown by Jesus, only those will go to heaven' - its truth cannot be examined
 prashn yah he ki vigyaan kii drut gati se jo unnati hui, uskaa shrey kise he? kya pracheen kaal ke manushya in arvachin vaigyanikon kii apeksha buddhi kam rakhte the? yadi aisi baat he, to darshan, sahitya evam lalit kalaon kii unnati pracheen samay main itani adhik kyon hui? sambhavat: iskaa rahasy un vaigyanik vidhiyon main nihit he, jinka prashray paakar vigyaan itani unnati kar sakaa he
 Early science began about three hundred years ago
 jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, pracheen kaal main bhi vigyaan kii kuch unnati hui, kintu uskaa kram aage na bad paaya
 Therefore some thing must have been behind it
 vastut: pracheen kaal ke manishiyon ne jo bhi gyaan arjeet kiya, use buddhivaadee kahana thik hoga
 On the strength of his intelligence and reasoning, he spoke of the highest level of knowledge, but there was no system of his type and enhancement and he could not be widely publicized and broadcasted throughout the world
 Ancient science is the practical knowledge to the contrary, which was initially opposed Happened
 isi ke falswaroop galileo jaise agragami vaigyanikon ko kadi yatnaayen sahani padin
 Nevertheless, the seed of transmission was also hidden within the verification method by experiment
 is prakaar jo gyaan miltaa gaya, vah ek shrunkhlaa main aabaddh ho chalaa, jiskaa kram aage bhi jari rahaa
 This knowledge revealed new sources of power and as a result, not only its opposition reduced but a huge revolution took place in the society
 mashin yug kaa sutarapaat hua or sansar me aashaa kii ek nai kiran saamne ai
 But just as all aspects of good and evil are associated with all things, science is not only a boon for humans, its vampiric form is seen by the world as an atom bomb in Hiroshima, due to which the destruction of the world and The scene of the Holocaust of Leela is present
 is prakaar sansar ke saamne "satya ko keval satya ke liye" khoj na karne kii aavashyaktaa jaan padi or "satyam shivan sundaram" ke adarsh ko vigyaan jagat main bhi apnaanaa hi shreyaskar maaloom hua
 Science can contribute to human welfare only by being controlled in this way
 isi niyantran ke falswaroop parmanviya bhatthiyaan baniin, jo ek prakaar se niyantrit atum bam maatr hai, kintu jinase apaar suvidhaayen mil sakati hai
 In this way, we see that in a short period of time science has made great progress and all its credit is due to experimentation, which was not used in ancient times
 is prayogvidhi main prayog kaa mahatv sarvopari he, phir bhi anya or vidhiyon kaa upyog bhi ek vishesh dhang or kram se kiya jaataa he, jinhen ham vaigyanik vidhiyaan kah sakate hai
 The methods which are used collectively or partially in the study of science are described below: nirikshan - jis prakritik vastu yaa ghatana kaa adhyayan karnaa ho, sabase pehle uskaa dhyanpurvak nirikshan aavashyak he
 If an event is transient, it is necessary to depict it so that it can be inspected later, such as an eclipse
 nirikshan ke liye sookshmdarshi yaa doordarshee kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, taaki adhik vistaar ke saath or thik thik nirikshan ho sake
 If other people are also doing the work of inspection, then it should be welcomed that the focus is only on the inspected object, just as Arjuna was only seeing the head of the bird at the time of the examination of commerce
 kabhi-kabhi kis vastu ke vishay main mastishk main pehle se kuch dharna bani rahati he, jo nishpaksh nirikshan main bahut baadhak hoti he
 At the time of inspection, one should act free from such assumptions
 varnan - nirikshan ke saath hi saath, yaa turant baad, nirikshit vastu yaa ghatana kaa varnan likhnaa chahie
 For this, the use of measured words should be done, so that a picture of the object that is not in front of the reader is drawn
 jahaan kahin aavashyaktaa ho, anumaan ke dwaara ankon main vastu ke gunavishesh kii maap de deni chahie, kitu yah tabhi karnaa chahie jab vaisaa karnaa baad main upyogi siddh honevaala ho
 While describing the color of flowers, it is useless to give approximate wavelength, but it is better to compare the hardness of an object in numbers than in any other object
 vyarth ke vyore na die jaaen or bhashaa saral tathaa subodh ho
 a description of the country, time and environment should be given so that the circumstances under which the object may be available can be known
 kaary-kaaran-vivechan - prakruti ke rahasyodghatan main kaaryakaaran kaa vivechan mahatvapurn he
 Rainfall, thunderstorms, lightning flashes, windstorms and storms etc
 can occur together
 inamen koun kitna kaaran hai? praaia: kaaran pehle aata he, kintu keval kram hi kaaran kaa nishchay nahi karata
 Therefore, these things should be considered a little, so that there is no further confusion
 saath hi vibhinn kaarnon kaa taratamya bhi band rakhana chahie
 All these things are helpful in understanding the incident
 prayogikaran - vigyaan kii is yug main jo bhi sheeghra unnati ho pai, uskaa ekmaatr shrey is vidhi ko hi he, kyoki anya vidhiyaan to isi mukhya vidhi ke ird gird sanjoyi gai hai
 This technique is a product of this era

 For this type of generalization it is necessary that the samples that are collected are done in an uneventful manner, otherwise the result that will be drawn will not be correct
 kabhi kabhi kuch raashiyon kaa madhyamaan nikaala jaataa he, kintu yah tabhi karnaa thik hoga jab aisa karnaa tarksangat ho
 For example, "lekha jokha thahe, boy drowned kahe" shows that the average river depth may submerge a boy even though it is less than the height of a boy

 Microeconomics examines how these decisions and behaviors affect the supply and demand for goods and services, which determine prices and how, in turn, determine the supply and demands of prices, goods and services Does

 One goal of microeconomics is to analyze market mechanisms that establish relative value between goods and services and allocate limited resources among many alternative uses
 sookshirthshaastra bazaar kii vifaltaa kaa vishleshan karata he, jahaan bazaar prabhaavshaalee parinaam utpann karne main vifal rahete hai or yah purna pratiyogita ke liye aavashyak saidhantik avasthaaon kaa varnan karata he
 Important areas of study in microeconomics include general equilibrium, markets under asymmetric information, options under uncertainty, and economic applications of game theory
 bazaar vyavastha ke bheetar utpaadon ke loch par bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The theory of supply and demand generally assumes that markets are purely competitive
 iskaa matlab yah he ki bazaar main kai kreta evam vikreta hai or kisi main bhi vastuon or sevaaon kii keemton ko mahatvapurn rup se prabhavit karne kii kshamta nahin hoti he
 In many real-life transactions, this assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices

 However, this principle works well under normal conditions
 mukhyadhara ke arthshaastra ek praathamikta kii purvadharna nahin karte hai ki bazaar saamaajik sanghathan ke anya roopon ke liye shreyaskar hote hai
 In fact, more analysis is made of situations where so-called market failures provide resource allocation that is not of a higher standard or quality by some standard
 In such cases, economists may seek to explore policies that are directly, indirectly, regulated by governmental controls that encourage market participants to act in a manner that is optimal, or that efficient trade is possible
 To prevent the wastage, by creating a "lost" market that does not already exist
 It is studied in the field of collective action
 yah bhi dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki "anukultam kalyaan" aam taur par parato sambandhi maanak kaa rup letaa he, jo caldor-hiks ke apane ganitiya anuprayog main arthshaastra ke maandand sambandhi paksh ke bheetar samuhik kriya, arthath saarvajanik chunaav kaa adhyayan karne vaale upyogetavaadi maanak ke saath sangat nahin rahata he
 Market failure in positivist economics is limited in effects without mixing the economist's belief and his theory
 vyaktiyon dwaara vibhinn vastuon ke liye maang ko aam taur par upyogita-adhiktam karne vaali prakriya ke parinaam ke rup main mana jaataa he
 An explanation of this relationship between price and quantity demanded that a given item be, with all goods and constraints remaining, this set of options is what makes the consumer most happy
 yah maan liya jaataa he ki sabhi form tarksangat nirnay-nirdhaaran kaa anusaran kar rahi hai or ve laabh ko adhiktam karne vaale output par utpaadan karenge
 is dharna ko dekhte hue, chaar shreniyon main ek form ke laabh par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In microeconomics, the term "market failure" does not mean that a given market has stopped functioning
 iske bajaay, bazaar kii vifaltaa ek sthiti he jisamen ek diya hua bazaar kushaltapurvak utpaadan sangathit nahin karata he yaa upabhoktaaon ko vasteen evam sevaayen aavantit nahin karata he
 Economists normally apply the term to situations where the first welfare theorem fails so that market outcomes are no longer within the limits of the Pareto

 There are four main types or causes of market failure: kisi gatividhi kii avasar laagat sarvshereshth agle purvanishchit vikalp ke baraabar hoti he
 Although the amount of opportunity cost is difficult to determine, the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real at the individual level
 vastav main, yah siddhant sabhi nirnyon ke liye lagu hota he, na ki keval aarthik siddhanton ke liye
 ioystreliyai arthshaastri freedrik won vijar ki rachana ke samay se, avasar laagat ko mulya ke seemaant siddhant kii neenv ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Opportunity cost is a method of measuring the cost of an item
 kisi pariyojna ke laagton kii sirf pahchaan karnaa yaa laagton ko jodne ke bajaay, koi vyakti samaan rupee kharch karne ke liye agle sarvshereshth vaikalpik tareeke kii bhi pahchaan kar saktaa he
 The advantage of this next best alternative method is the opportunity cost of the original choice
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ek kisaan he jo apni bhoomi ko padosiyon ko kiraye par dene, jisamen avasar laagat kiraye par dene se hone vaala purvanishchit laabh he, kii bajaay us par kheti karne kaa chunaav karata he
 In this situation, the farmer alone can hope to generate more profit
 isi prakaar se, vishvavidhyalay main pravesh lene kaa avasar laagat khoyi huyi mazdooree he, jise koi vidhyaarthee kaarybal ke dwaara arjeet kar saktaa tha, bajaay kii tution, pustakon or anya aavashyak vastuon kaa kharch he 
 bahama main kisi chuttee kii avasar laagat ek ghar ke liye tatkaal adaayagi kii rakam ho sakati he
 Note that opportunity cost is not the sum of available options, but rather the benefit of a single, best option
 shahar dwaara apni khaali jameen par aspataal kaa nirmaan karne ke nirnay kii sambhavit avasar laagat khel ke ek centre liye bhoomi kaa nuksaan, yaa parking ke liye bhoomi kaa upyog karne kii asamarthta, yaa rupaya jise bhoomi ko bech kar praapt kiya ja saktaa tha, yaa vibhinn anya sambhavit upyogon main se kisi ek kii haani - lekin samgr rup se sabhi nahin, he
 The right opportunity cost will be the pre-determined benefit from the most profitable item among those listed
 yahaan ek sawaal uthta he ki iske laabh kaa moolyankan karne ke liye tulana ko sahaj karne evam avasar laagat kaa moolyankan karne ke liye prayek vikalp se jude hue ek dollar mulya kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie, jo hamaare dwaara tulana kii jane vaali vastuon par nirbhar karte hue kamovesh kathin ho saktaa he
 For example, many decisions involve environmental impacts whose dollar value is difficult to evaluate due to scientific uncertainty
 ek maanav jivan yaa arctic main tel ke ek chhalkaav ke aarthik prabhaav ke moolyankan karne main naitik prabhaav ke saath vyaktiparak vikalp bananaa shaamil hota he
 It is important to understand that nothing is free
 koi kya karnaa chunata he, isse koi fark nahin padataa he, vah badale main hameshaa kuch chodta rahata he
 An example of opportunity cost is to decide between going to a concert and doing homework
 yadi koi vyakti ek sangeet kaarykram main jane kaa nirnay karata he, tab vah adhyayan ke bahumoolya samay ko kho rahaa he, lekin agar vah homework karnaa chunata he tab to laagat sangeet kaaryan ko chhod rahaa he
 Opportunity cost is important for understanding microeconomics and decisions made

 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era

 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
