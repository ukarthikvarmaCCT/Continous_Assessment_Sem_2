 charvak darshan ek bhautikwaadi naastik darshan he
 It accepts only direct evidence and does not accept this doctrine from the hereafter
 yah darshan vedabaahya bhi kaha jaataa he
 The Vedabya philosophies are six - Charvaka, Madhyamika, Yogachara, Sautrantika, Vaibhashika, and Arhat
 in sabhi main veda se asammat siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 Ajit Keshakambali is credited as the precursor of Charvaka, while Jupiter is commonly referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokayat philosophy
 charvak, brihaspati sutara ke adhikansh praathmik sahitya gaayab yaa kho gaye hai
 Its teachings have been compiled from historical secondary literature such as the scriptures, sutras, and in Indian epic poetry and from the dialogues and Jain literature of Gautama Buddha
 charvak pracheen bharat ke ek anishvaravaadi or naastik taarkik the
 They are believed to be the disciples of Jupiter, the originator of the atheist
 brihaspati or charvak kab hue iskaa kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 Jupiter is considered by Chanakya in his Arthashastra book to be one of the principal teachers of economics
 charvak kaa naam sunate hi aapako ‘yada jivet sukhan jivet, rin kruthva, ghrutan pivet’ kii yaad aegi
 ‘charvak’ naam ko hi ghrinaaspad gaali kii tarah badal diya gaya he
 It was as if the borrowers, philanthropists and degenerates were the only people who followed this principle
 prachlit dharna yahi he ki charvak shabd kii utpati ‘chaaru’+’vaak’ se hui he
 It is evident that this nomenclature has been made by those opponents of this theory who believed that these people seduced innocent people with sweet things
 charvak siddhanton ke liye buddha pitakon tak main ‘lokayat’ shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jiskaa matlab ‘darshan kii vah pranali he jo jo is lok main vishwaas karti he or swarg, narak athwa mukti kii avadharana main vishwaas nahin rakhti’
 charvak yaa lokayat darshan kaa zikr to mahabharat main bhi miltaa he lekin iskaa koi bhi mul granth uplabdh nahin
 Apparently, as it spoke against the ruling forces of its time, its texts were destroyed and in the popular narrative, the Charvakas were introduced as villains
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak kaa mat diya hua miltaa he
 It is written in Padmapurana that Jupiter had expressed Vedaviruddha opinion to seduce Asuras
 naastik mat ke sambadh main vishnupurana main likhaa he ki jab dharmabal se daitya bahut prabal hue tab devataaon ne vishnu ke yahan pukaar kii
 Vishnu produced a man named Mayamoh from his body who went on the banks of the Narmada in the form of Digambar and seduced the Asuras and corrupted them in the Dharmargava
 mayamoh ne asuron ko jo upadesh kiya vah sarvadarshansangrah main die hue charvak mat ke shlokon se bilkul miltaa he
 Like, - Mayamoh has said that if the animal killed in the yagna goes to heaven then why does not Yajaman kill his father, etc
 lingapurana main tripuravinaash ke prasang main bhi shivaprerit ek digambar muni dwaara asuron ke isi prakaar bahakaae jane kii katha likhi he jiskaa lakshya jainon par jaan padataa he
 In the Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya scandal, Maharishi Javali's preaching to Ramachandra to leave Banabas and return to Ayodhya is also found in the opinion of Charvak
 in sab baton se siddh hota he ki naastik mat bahut pracheen he
 It should be understood at the same time that the excess of Vedic rituals had started knocking some people
 charvak ishwar or paralok nahin maanate
 His philosophy is also called Lokayat because of not obeying the hereafter
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak ke mat se sukh hi is jivan kaa pradhan lakshya he
 There is also sorrow in the world, realizing that those who do not want to enjoy happiness are fools
 machhlee main kaante hote hai to kya isse koi machhlee hi na khaay ? choupaae khet par jaayange, is dar se kya koi khet hi na bove ? ityadi
 Charvaks do not consider the soul as a separate substance
 unke mat se jis prakaar gud, tandul aadi ke sanyog se madh main maadakta utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu in chaar bhuton ke sanyogvishesh se chetanta utpann ho jaati he
 By their analysis or destruction, 'I' means consciousness is also destroyed
 is chetan sharir ke naam ke peeche phir punaragaman aadi nahin hota
 God, otherworldly subjects etc
 are based on conjecture
 par charvak pratyaksh ko chhodkar anumaan ko pramaan main nahin lete
 He argues that inference is dependent on prevalence
 jo gyaan hamen baahar indriyon ke dwaara hota he use bhoot or bhavishya tak badhaakar le jane kaa naam vyaptigyaan he, jo asambhav he
 This knowledge is visible in the mind, it is not a proof because the mind is dependent on the senses for its experience
 yadi kaho ki anumaan ke dwaara vyaptigyaan hota he to itaretarashray dosha aata he, kyonki vyaptigyaan ko lekar hi to anumaan ko siddh kiya chaahate ho
 The idea of charvak should be seen in Sarvadarsanasangraha, sarvadarshanasiromani and jupitersutra
 naishadh ke 17wein sarg main bhi is mat kaa vistrut ullekh he
 Charvak only supports pragmatism, he does not follow the presumptions etc
 uske mat se prithvi jal tej or vaayu ye chaar hi tatv he, jinase sab kuch bana he
 In his opinion, the sky is not the position of the element, it is a body formed by the combination of these four elements, only a special type of combination of them creates consciousness in the body, which people call a soul
 sharir jab vinasht ho jaataa he, to chaitanya bhi khatm ho jaataa he
 In this way, the organism originates from these ghosts and ends as soon as these ghosts are destroyed, it has no importance back and forth
 isaliye jo chetan main deh dikhaai detii he vahi aatma kaa rup he, deh se atirikt aatma hone kaa koi pramaan hi nahin miltaa he
 By the opinion of Charvak, women are called sons and their relatives and the happiness given by them is called happiness
 unka aalingan karnaa hi purusharth he, sansar main khaanaa pinaa or sukh se rahanaa chaiye
 It has been said in this philosophy that: - arth he ki jab tak jeena chaiye sukh se jeena chaiye, agar apane paas saadhan nahin he, to duusare se udhaar lekar mouj karnaa chaiye, shamshaan main sharir ke jalane ke baad sharir ko kisne waapas aate dekha he? According to Charvaka philosophy, these four elements earth, water, light and air are the root causes of creation
 jis prakaar buddha usee prakaar charvak kaa bhi mat he ki akaash naamak koi tatva nahin he
 This is just zero
 apni aanvik avasthaa se sthool avasthaa main aane par uparyukt chaar tatva hi bahya jagat, indriya athwa deh ke rup main drusht hote hai
 Their proof system is the reason behind not obeying the objective power of the sky
 jis prakaar ham gandh, ras, rup or sparsh kaa pratyaksh anubhav karte hue unke samavayiyon kaa bhi tattat indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh karte hai
 The sky element is not the same
 at: unke mat main akaash naamak tatva he hi nahin
 What is the reason for the four elements? Charvakas do not have the answer to this question
 yah vishwa akasmaat bhinn-bhinn roopon evam bhinn-bhinn matraaon main milane vaale chaar mahabhuton kaa sangrah yaa sanghatt maatr he
 According to the Charvakas, there is no other substance called the Atma from the four mahabhutas
 chaitanya aatma kaa gun he
 Since there is no such thing as a soul, therefore the virtue or religion of the conscious body is proved
 arthath yah sharir hi aatma he
 There are three types of its accomplishment - logic, experience and Ayurveda scripture
 tark se aatma kii siddhi ke liye charvak log kehete hai ki sharir ke rahane par chaitanya rahata he or sharir ke na rahane par chaitanya nahin rahata
 With this unknown contrast, the body itself proves to be the basis of consciousness
 anubhav 'main sthool hoon', 'main durbal hoon', 'main gora hoon', 'main niskriy hoon' ityadi anubhav hamen pag-pag par hota he
 Physical weakness etc
 are the religions of the body and 'I' is also the same
 at: sharir hi aatma he
 How Ayurveda mixes good, barley, mahua, etc
, in order of chronological order, a mixture is produced in that mixture, or a mixture of curd, yellow clay and cow dung produces a scorpion in it, or in betel, catechu, betel nut and lime
 Even if there is no red color, the redness in the mouth is produced due to their mixture, similarly Chaitanya is produced by the specific combination of quadrilaterals
 kintu in bhuton ke vishisht maatra main mishran kaa kaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvak ke paas swabhaavvaad ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 In the scriptures of God, justice etc
, God is proved by the presumption or objection
 chunki charvak pratyaksh or keval pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he at: uske mat main pratyaksh drishyman raja hi ishwar hai vah apane rajya kaa tathaa usamen rahane vaali praja kaa niyanta hota he
 Therefore, he should be considered as God
 prameya arthath vishay kaa yatharth gyaan arthath prama ke liye pramaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Charvac folk consider only direct evidence
 vishay tathaa indriya ke sannikarsh se utpann gyaan pratyaksh gyaan kehalaata he
 The world theorem is directly visible through our senses
 iske atirikt anya padaarth asat he
 Through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, we all have the expression of the dirty smell and touch
 jo vastu anubhavgamya nahin hoti uske liye kisi anya pramaan kii aavashyaktaa bhi nahin hoti
 Buddhists, Jainism, non-vedic philosophy and nyaya-vedic, etc
 also consider semi-vedic philosophy inference as proof
 unka kahana he ki samast prameya padaarthon kii satta keval pratyaksh pramaan se siddh nahin kii ja sakati
 But Charvak states that only possibility can be created by inference
 nishchayatmak gyaan pratyaksh se hi hota hai
 Seeing the remote green lush trees, listening to the cacophony of the birds there, we consider the possibility of water there due to the cool breeze from there
 jal kii uplabdhi vahaan jaakar pratyaksh dekhne se hi nishchit hoti he
 Therefore, to generate possibility and to conduct public behavior, inference is necessary but it cannot be proof
 jis vyapti ke aadhaar par anumaan pramaan kii satta maani jaati he vah vyapti ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 It is the nature of fire with dhoom and the smell of smell with flowers
 sukh or dharm kaa du:kha or adharm kaa kaaryakaaran bhav swaabhaavik he
 Just like the sweetness in the word of Kokil and the consternation in the word of crows, it should be understood everywhere
 jahaan tak shabd pramaan kii baat he to vah to ek prakaar se pratyaksh pramaan hi he
 The words of the aggrieved person are directly told to us
 unako sunne se arth gyaan hota he
 This is obvious
 jahaan tak vedon kaa prashn he unke vaakya adrusht or ashrutapurna vishyon kaa varnan karte hai at: unki vishwasaneeyata sandigdh he
 At the same time, Vedas prove their inhumanity by doing disgusting things like Ashwaglagrahna in unrighteousness etc
 and committing abusive acts like eating meat and using meaningless words like Jarbhari Turfari
 uparyukt vivaran se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki charvak log is pratyaksh drishyman deh or jagat ke atirikt kisi anya padaarth ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Those people who consider Purusharthchatashta, called religion, meaning, work and salvation, are considered useful for men, ie human body
 unki drushti main arth or kaam hi param purusharth he
 It is foolish to believe in an object called religion because when there is no other heaven etc
 apart from this world, it is unrestrained to enjoy the fruit of religion in heaven
 pakhand dhurtton ke dwaara kapolkalpit swarg kaa sukh bhogane ke liye yahan yajna aadi karnaa dharm nahin he balki usamen kii jane vaali pashu hinsa aadi ke kaaran vah adharm hi he tathaa havan aadi karnaa tattd vastuon kaa durupyog tathaa vyarth sharir ko ksht dena he isaliye jo kaary sharir ko sukh pahunchaaye usee ko karnaa chaiye
 In which there is satisfaction of the senses, the mind should rejoice
 jinase indriyon kii tripti ho man anandit ho unheen vishyon kaa seven karnaa chaiye
 Religion is not to remove, not kill, kill those elements which are obstructing the senses of the body
 shaareerik maansik ksht sahanaa, vishayanand se man or sharir ko balaat virat karnaa adharm he
 This means that the believer in Vedic and even semi-vedic philosophies, following the ethos described in the Puranas, if the body is a seeker of happiness, they should follow it and if they are obstructed by it, they should be discarded forever
 charvaakon kii moksh kii kalpana bhi unke tatva mimasaa evam gyaan mimasaa ke prabhaav se purna prabhavit he
 As long as there is a body, a man suffers from various kinds of suffering
 yahi narak he
 Freedom from this suffering group is attained when the body becomes conscious, that is, it dies
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body does not experience any suffering
 yadhyapi anya darshanon main aatma ke astitv ko sweekaar karte hue usee ke mukt hone kii charchaa kii gayi he or moksh kaa swaroop bhinn-bhinn darshanon main bhinn-bhinn he, tathaapi charvak unki manyata ko prashray nahin dete
 He neither considers salvation as eternal, neither considers it to be true and chit form, nor does he accept salvation as his position in Sachchidanand form
 charvak darshan vah darshan he jo jan saamaanya main swabhaavat: priy he
 The philosophy whose sentences are charu means interesting is the Charvak philosophy
 sabhi shastreey gambheer vishyon kaa vyaavhaarik evam loukik purv paksh hi charvak darshan he
 Everything we do in the natural form is the basis of the Charvak philosophy
 charvak darshan jivan ke har paksh ko sahaj drushti se dekhtaa he
 This simple vision towards life is Charvak philosophy
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki, vishwa kaa har maanav jo jivan jeeta he vah charvak darshan hi he
 Such sentences and principles which will be pleasing to everyone, will be a rectangle or special in the world
 sambhavat: yahi kaaran he ki ham charvak darshan ko lokayat darshan ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 This philosophy is also famous among scholars known as Barhaspatya philosophy
 is naam se yah prathit hota he ki yah darshan brihaspati ke dwaara virachit he
 Brihaspati is recognized as the guru of the gods in Indian society
 parantu bhartiya sahitya main brihaspati ek nahin hai
 It is a very difficult task to decide who is the originator of Charvak philosophy, Jupiter
 anigaras evam loukya rup main do brihaspatiyon kaa samullekh rugveda main praapt hota he
 According to Ashwaghosha, Arghus is the prophet of Jupiter's philosophy
 loukya brihaspati ke mat main sat padaarth kii utpatti asat se maani jaati he
 Similarly, the origin of discrete matter has been assumed from the truth
 jad padaarthon ko hi asat kaha jaataa he
 Conscious substances are called Satas according to this belief
 ek brihaspati kaa nirdesh mahabharat ke van parv main bhi praapt hota he
 This Jupiter takes the form of Venus, to conserve Indra and to destroy the demons, to create anatomism or prapancha science
 is prapanch vigyaan ke falswaroop shubh ko ashubh evam ashubh ko shubh maanate hue daanav veda evam shastron kii aalochana evam ninda main sanlagn ho jate hai
 In another context, there is a description of another Jupiter in the Mahabharata itself, who, together with Shukracharya, composed the discourse
 vibhinn shastron ke aacharyon kii maane to charvak mat darshan kii shrenee main nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki is darshan main maatr madhur vachanon kii aad main vanchanaa kaa hi kaary kiya gaya he
 It is another thing that if you listen to Charvak, he also declares various scholars to be deceptive
 ek aise brihaspati kaa taittareey brahman granth main varnan miltaa he jo gayatri devi ke mastak par aghat karata he gayatri devi ko padam puraana ke anusaar samast vedon kaa mul mana gaya he
 From this point of view it can be considered as the antagonist of Jupiter Veda
 sambhavat: veda kaa virodh prati pad karne ke kaaran is brihaspati ko charvak darshan kaa praneta bhi mana janaa yuktiyukt hoga
 The theme of Jupiter is also found in Vishnu Purana
 brihaspati kii is manyata ke anusaar vaidic karmkand bahuvitt ke vyay evam prayaas se saadhy he
 These Vedic remedies for the seekers of diverse pleasures are the law of some self-centered selfishness
 taarkik brihaspati kaa bhi kahin kahin varnan miltaa he
 They are the followers of the Jupiter Veda, but only support rational rituals
 inaki drushti se tatva nirnay shaastra par aadhaarit avashya hona chahie parantu yah shastreey anusandhan tark poshit hona nitant aavashyak he
 Argumentless thinking can never be meaningful in determining religion
 vatsyayan muni ne apane vishwa prasiddh granth kamasutra main arthshaastra ke rachayita ke rup main brihaspati kaa ullekh kiya he
 According to a formula of economics written by Jupiter, only Lokayata has been recognized as a scripture
 falat: arthshaastra ke praneta brihaspati evam lokayat shaastra ke pravarttak main antar kar paanaa atyant duruh kaary he
 Some critics have considered Jupiter to be the creator of Kamasutra as well as the creator of economics and the creator of Lokayata Shastra
 yadi loukik ichchhaaon ko purna karnaa hi charvak darshan kaa uddeshy he to kaamshaastra ke pravarttak muni vatsyayan hi brihaspati hai, yah maananaa upyukt hi he
 Kautilya has given a comfortable rendering of Lokayat philosophy in economics
 is prakaar arthshaastra ke rachanaakaar kautilya evam lokayat darshan ke praneta brihaspati ek hi hai aisa mana ja saktaa he
 According to the treasurer Hemachandra, the author of Economics, Kamasutra, nyasutra-bhasya, Panchatantra and Chanakya Policy is the same
 itani vivechna ke baad jo brihaspati vaidic vaaiumay main vibhinn prasangon main charchit hai unke yatha kram naam is prakaar spasht hote hai
 In the context of Padma Purana, Angira is the psyche son of Brahma
 angiras brihaspati angira ke putr evam brahma ke pautra hai
 As a result, they are counted among the gods
 is prakaar dev guru brihaspati evam angiras brihaspati main koi bhed nahin mana ja saktaa
 For the preservation of the gods, the preaching of the devas to the asuras by the Guru of the gods has been implied in various worlds, this statement cannot be reliable in the context of Dev Guru Brihaspati
 asur apane guru shukracharya ke rahete devguru ke upadesh ko kyon aadar denge? at: devguru se atirikt koi charvak darshan kaa pravarttak hona apekshit he
 Some critics have categorically acknowledged that Jupiter, the master of Charvaka, the master of heaven Indra, the master of heaven, is not a world-renowned Jupiter
 ye brihaspati kisi rajkul ke guru hai
 From the historical point of view, if Vashistha, Vishwamitra, Dronacharya, etc
, being the master of any Rajkula, is also giving the basis of this belief
 jis prakaar aastik darshanon main shankar darshan shiromani ke rup main sweekrut he usee prakaar naastik darshanon main sabase utkrisht naastik ke rup main shiromani kii tarah charvak darshan kii pratishtha nirvivaad he
 Atheist Shiromani Charvak is also believed to have rejected the supernatural sovereign power of God recognized in one form or another on the basis of faith in the world
 inke matanusaar ishwar naam kii koi vastu sansar main nahin he
 The atheist Shiromani Charwak, who is visible from some external senses, feels the same, accepts his power
 yahi kaaran he ki charvak ke siddhanth main pratyaksh pramaan ko chhod kar koi doosraa pramaan nahin mana gaya he
 The power of the God who has been conceived in other philosophies is not possible through direct evidence
 inke mat se beej se jo ankur kaa pradurbhaav hota he usamen ishwar kii bhoomika ko maananaa anaavashyak evam uphasaaspad hi he
 The origin of sprout is proven to be a natural and natural process of survival by the combination of soil and water
 is swabhaavik kaary ko sampann karne ke liye kisi adrusht kartta kii sweekruti nirarthak he
 If you do not believe in God, how will it be possible to arrange the results of good and inauspicious deeds of living beings? Solving this question, Charvak asks, which system of karma fruit is required? Two types of karma are seen in the world
 ek loukik tathaa doosraa alokik karm
 Are you concerned about the arrangement of the fruits of cosmic actions? If yes, then this concern is unnecessary
 loukik karmon kaa fal vidhaan to lok main sarv maanya raja yaa prashaasak hi karata he
 This proven fact is obvious
 ham dekhte hai ki chaurya karm aadi nishiddh kaary karne vaale ko uske dushkarm kaa samuchit fal, lok siddh raja hi dand ke rup main karagaar aadi main bhej kar detaa he
 In the same way, a person who performs auspicious actions like protecting one's life, etc
, in the form of a reward, the king confirms it with a good means of wealth and honor
 yadi aap alokik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sandarbh main sachint hai to yah chintaa bhi nahin kerani chahie
 Because all these Yajna, Puja, recitation, penance etc
 prescribed in terms of parlokik fruits have been conceived by some rogues with a view to cheating the common man and to maintain their livelihood and stomach
 vastav main agnihotra, teen veda, tridand kaa dhaaran tathaa sharir main jagah jagah bhasma kaa sanlep buddhi evam purusharth hinata ke hi parichaayak hai
 No one has lost sight of these Vedic deeds till date
 yadi vaidic karmon kaa koi fal hota to avashya kisi na kisi ko iskaa pratyaksh aaj tak hua hota
 Therefore, till date no one has the direct experience of these Vedic or Varnashrama-system-related deeds - heaven, salvation, devaloka gaan etc
, so all these Vedic deeds are unfruitful, it is proved to be automatic
 yahan yadi aastik darshan yah kahe ki paralok swarg aadi ko siddh karne vaala vyapaar adrusht yaa dharm evam adharm he jisase swarg kii siddhi hoti he to yah charvak ko sweekaarya nahin he
 Rejecting the supernatural, the Charvak abrogates the role of the unseen in the means of heaven and heaven and thus destroys the core of the believer's philosophy
 yahi kaaran he ki adrusht ke aadhaar par siddh hone vaale swarg aadi paralok ke nirasan ke saath hi is adrusht ke niamak yaa vyavasthaapak ke rup main ishwar kaa bhi niraas charvak mat main anayas hi ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, no living being is different from the body
 sharir hi jeev yaa aatma he
 As a result, when the destruction of the body takes place after the cremation after death, then the creature or soul also perishes
 sharir main jo chaar yaa paanch mahabhuton kaa samavdhaan he, yah samavdhaan hi chaitanya kaa kaaran he
 This belief that this creature goes beyond death after death, it is proved unfounded by accepting the body as conscious or soul
 shastron main paribhaashit moksh rup param purusharth bhi charvak nahin sweekaar karata he
 Salvation of the conscious body is salvation in this opinion
 dharm evam adharm ke na hone se charvak siddhanth main dharm-adharm yaa punya-paap ko, koi adrishy swarg evam narak aadi fal bhi nahin he yah anayas hi siddh ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, how do you remember the sensory sports, etc
 in childhood, or old age when you consider the body to be a soul? This is a burning question that arises easily
 yahan yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki baalyavastha kaa sharir, vriddhavastha kaa sharir evam yuvavastha kaa sharir ek hi he
 If the body of the three states were the same, then there would not be such a big difference between the bodies of these three states
 antar se yah spasht siddh hota he ki sharir ke avyav jo maance pind aadi hai inamen vruddhi evam hraas hota he
 And it is only due to these degradation and growth that destruction of the body of childhood and creation of the body of youth is proved
 yadi yah kahen ki yuvavastha ke sharir main yah vahi sharir he, yah vyavhaar hone ke kaaran sharir ko ek maan kar uparyukt samaran ko utpann kiya ja saktaa he, to yah kathan bhi yuktiyukt nahin ho saktaa
 Because this is the same body, this affirmation is due to the similarity of form and shape
 falat: donon avasthaaon ke shariron ko abhinn nahin mana ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, in order to fulfill the memory of the pre-seen childhood period, the birth rites in the body of the Charvak Balakala create new rites like the ones in the body of other youth
 isi prakaar yuvavastha ke sharir main vidyaman sanskaar vriddhavastha ke sharir main apane jaise sanskaar utpann kar dete hai
 The etavata is recollected in the Charvak School without any hindrance from the address of these childhood rites
 antat: charvak darshan main sharir hi aatma he yah sahaj hi siddh hota he
 If the body itself is a soul, then Charvak can be asked that 'mama body' this is my body, how will such a popular behavior be generated? By this behavior it seems that the body is different and the master of the body is someone else, who is a separate soul from the body
 is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak kahata he ki jaise daanav vishesh ke sir ko hi raahu kaha gaya he, phir bhi jan-saamaanya 'raahu kaa sir' yah vyavhaar bade hi sahaj rup main karata he, usee prakaar sharir ke hi aatma hone par bhi 'meraa sharir' yah loksiddh vyavhaar uppann ho jaayegaa
 In the Charvakas, the objection of remembrance on the destruction of the senses, considering some of the Charvak senses to be souls, is not dispelled
 kinhin charvaakon ne praan evam man ko bhi aatma ke rup main mana he
 To prove that the body is a soul, Charvak also presents the context of this Veda for the satisfaction of the believers
 is veda vachan kaa taatpary he ki 'vigyaan se yukt aatma in bhuton se utpann ho kar ant main in bhuton main hi villin ho jaataa he
 It is the merger of the soul with the body in the ghosts and death
 ' Tirumavalavan or weighment
 Tirumavalavan, a Dalit activist, is a Member of Parliament in the 15th Lok Sabha and the current president of Vidudalai Chiruthaigal Kacchi, a Dalit political party in the state of Tamil Nadu, India
 ve 1990 ke dashak main ek dalit netaa ke rup main prasiddh hue or 1999 main unhone raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 Their political base focuses on preventing caste-based oppression of Dalits, which they believe can only be achieved through reviving and redirecting Tamil nationalism
 unhone srilanka sahit anya sthanon main tamil rashtravaadi andolanon or samoohon ke liye samarthan bhi vyakt kiya he
 Tirumavalavan was the second child of Tolkappian and Periyamal and was born in the village of Anganur in Ariyalur district, Tamil Nadu, India
 unke pita ne aathvin kaksha tak adhyayan kiya tha, jabaki unki maa ashikshit rahi
 He has a sister and three brothers, but he was the only member of his family who received higher education after school
 unhone shuru main rasayan vigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya or baad main aparaadh vigyaan main snatakottar oopaadhi praapt kii, jiske baad unhone madras lau college se vidhi kaa adhyayan kiya
 He then started working in the government forensics department as an assistant scientist
 srilanka main tamilon par srilankai sena ke atyaacharon kii sharnaarthiyon dwaara mili khabar kii pratikriya swaroop raajnneeti main unki ruchi 1982 main badhane lagi jab ve abhi chaatr hi the
 He started organizing rallies, boycotts and conferences to support the Sri Lankan issue
 unhone madras lau college kaa chakkar lagaaya, lekin asafal rahe
 This, he said, was reportedly due to his being a Dalit
 is ghatana ke baad unki mulaaqaat tamilnadu kii ek pramukh raajnneetik party, dravid munetra kadgam ke party netaaon se hui
 In 1988, while working in the Government Forensics Department in the southern city of Madurai, he met the Tamil Nadu State Convenor Malachami of the Dalit Panthers of India, an organization fighting for the rights of Dalits
 agle saal malachami kii mrityu ke baad, thirumavalwan ko dipiai kaa netaa chunaa gaya
 He created a new flag for the organization in 1990
 apane kaam ke hisse ke rup main, unhone madurai kshetra ke dalit gaanvon kaa daura shuru kiya or daliton ko pesh aa rahi samasyaon ko samajhnaa shuru kiya
 The killing of two Dalits in 1992, he says, made them more militant

 2009 ke aam chunaav main, thirumavalwan ko chidambaram loksabhaa nirvachan kshetra se sansad ke liye nirvaachit kiya gaya
 Thirumavalavan's politics is based on redefining Tamil nationalism, which seeks to convert it into a force for the abolition of the caste system
 ve kehete hai ki daliton kaa utpeedan, bharat main sansthagat he, jisamen tamilnadu bhi shaamil he
 Although the Dravidian parties that dominate Tamil Nadu politics are ideologically committed to the abolition of the caste system, Thirumavalavan argues that those people have in practice fallen away from the core ideals of the Dravidian movement
 ve kehete hai ki unki nitiyon ne mukhya rup se madhya jatiyon ko hi labhanvit kiya he or vastav main daliton ke utpeedan main vruddhi kii he jahaan atyaachaari rup main brahmanon kii jagah madhya jatiyon ne lee he
 Dalits cannot and should not expect much help from Dravidian parties
 thirumavalwan ke anusaar, samaadhaan tamil rashtrawaad main he
 They say that caste oppression can be eliminated by just raising resistance from the grassroots level, arousing Tamil sentiments, as Periyar E
V
 It took place in the early days of the Dravidian movement under the guidance of Ramasamy
 agar tamilnadu main ek sahi sarkaar gathit hoti he, to jati utpeedan turant gaayab ho jayega
 Thirumavalavan is also a staunch critic of Hindu nationalism, especially of Hindutva
 According to Thirumavalavan, Hindutva is the essence of the oppressive Indian state
 unka tark he ki hindutv ne dharm ke madhyam se tamil samaaj ko uttari bharat ke saath mishrit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 From this, they say, the Tamil people have lost their identity
 unki drushti main, jaateey tamil rashtrawaad, hindutv kaa muqabla karne ke liye aavashyak he
 Thirumavalavan's view on the importance of Tamil identity has led him to support Tamil separatist groups in Sri Lanka, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a war-torn separatist group formally designated as a terrorist organization in India

 is kii purna katha kaa sankshep is prakaar se he
 According to the Puranas, Brahma was born to Atri, Atri to Moon, Moon to Mercury and Mercury to Illanandan Pururava
 pururava se aayu, aayu se raja nahush or nahush se yayati utpann hue
 Purified by Yayati
 puru ke vansh main bharat or bharat ke kul main raja kuru hue
 Shantanu was born in the clan of Kuru
 shantanu se ganganandan bhishma utpann hue
 He had two younger brothers - Chitrangad and Vichitravirya
 ye shantanu se satyavati ke garbh se utpann hue the
 After Shantanu moved to heaven, Bhishma remained unmarried and followed the kingdom of his brother Vichitravirya
 chitrangad baalyavastha main hi chitrangad naam vaale gandharv ke dwaara maare gayi
 Then Bhishma defeated the opposition in the war and brought two of Kashiraj's daughters - Ambika and Ambalika
 ve donon vichitraveery kii bharyaayein huin
 After some time, King Vichitravirya became a resident of Rajayakshma and died
 tab satyavati kii anumati se vyasaji ke dwaara ambika ke garbh se raja dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu utpann hue
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons from Gandhari's womb, of which Duryodhana was the eldest, and Pandu had five sons, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, etc
 dhritarashtra janm se hi andhe the atah unki jagah par pandu ko raja banaaya gaya, isse dhritarashtra ko sadaa apni netraheenta par krodh aata or pandu se dwembhaavna hone lagati
 Pandu conquered the whole of India and extended the boundaries of the Kuru kingdom to the country of Yevno
 ek baar raja pandu apni donon patniyon - kunti tathaa maadri - ke saath akhet ke liye van main gayi
 There, he saw a mating pair of deer
 pandu ne tatkaal apane baan se us mrug ko ghayal kar diya
 The innocent sage dying dying cursed Pandu, "rajan! There will be no cruel man like you in this world
 tuune mujhe maithun ke samay baan maaraa he atah jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga teri mrityu ho jaayegi
 " is shaap se pandu atyant duhkhi huye or apni raniyon se bole, "he deviyon! ab main apni samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag kar ke is van main hi rahoonga tum log hastinapur laut jaao" unke vachanon ko sun kar donon raniyon ne duhkhi hokar kaha, "nath! ham aapke bina ek kshan bhi jivit nahin rah saktin
 Please also please keep us with you in the forest
 " pandu ne unke anurodh ko sweekaar kar ke unhen van main apane saath rahane kii anumati de di
 During this time, King Pandu saw sages and sages on Amavasya going to see Brahma
 unhone un rishi-muniyon se swayan ko saath le jane kaa aagrah kiya
 On his request, the sages and sages said, "rajan! No childless person can be entitled to go to Brahmaloka, so we are unable to take you with us
" "rishi-muniyon kii baat sun kar pandu apni patni se bole, "he kunti! meraa janm lenaa hi vrutha ho rahaa he kyonki santanheen vyakti pitru-rin, rishi-rin, dev-rin tathaa manushya-rin se mukti nahin paa saktaa kya tum putr prapti ke liye meri sahaayta kar sakati ho?" kunti boli, "he aryaputra! durvasa rishi ne mujhe aisa mantra pradaan kiya he jisase main kisi bhi devtaa kaa aahvaan karke manovanchit vastu praapt kar sakati hoon
 You command which god i should call
 " is par pandu ne dharm ko aamantrit karne kaa aadesh diya
 Dharma gave Kunti a son named Yudhishthira
 kaalaantar main pandu ne kunti ko punah do baar vayudev tathaa indradev ko aamantrit karne kii ajna di
 Bhima from Vayudev and Arjuna originated from Indra
 tatpashchaat pandu kii ajna se kunti ne maadri ko us mantra kii diksha di
 Madri invited Ashwankumar and Nakula and Sahadeva were born
 ek din raja pandu maadri ke saath van main sarita ke tat par bhraman kar rahe the
 The atmosphere was very pleasant and there was a cool, slow-smelling air
 sahasaa vaayu ke jhonke se maadri kaa vastra ud gaya
 This caused Pandu's mind to become fickle and he was prone to sexual intercourse that he died under curse
 maadri unke saath sati ho gai kintu putron ke paalan-poshan ke liye kunti hastinapur laut ai
 The sage Muni, who lived there, left the palace leaving the palace, at the behest of sages Muni and Kunti, everyone accepted Pandavas as the sons of Pandu and welcomed him
 jab kunti kaa vivaah nahin hua tha, usee samay unke garbh se karn kaa janm hua tha
 But in fear of public shame, Kunti closed Karna in a box and shed it in the river Ganges
 a karn gangaji main bahata hua ja rahaa tha ki maharaj dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath or unki patni radha ne use dekha or use god le liya or uskaa laalan paalan karne lage
 From a very young age, Karna was more interested in warfare than in chariot like his father Adhirath
 karn or uske pita adhirath acharya dron se mili jo ki us samay yudhkala ke sarvshereshth aacharyon main se ek the
 Dronacharya used to teach Kuru princes at that time
 unhone karn ko shiksha dene se manaa kar diya kyonki karn ek sarathi putr tha or dron keval kshatriyon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 After Dronacharya's dissent, Karna approached Parasurama, who used to teach only Brahmins
 karn ne swayan ko brahman bataakar parashuram se shiksha kaa aagrah kiya
 Parashurama accepted Karna's request and mastered Karna in the same manner of warfare and archery
 is prakaar karn parashuram kaa ek atyant parishramee or nipun shishy bana
 Karna lived in the shelter of Duryodhana
 daivayog tathaa shakuni ke chal kapat se kauravon or pandavon main vair kii aag prajvalit ho uthi
 Duryodhana was a man of great intelligence
 usne shakuni ke kehane par pando ko bachapan main kai baar maarane kaa praytn kiya
 When he was a youth, when the superior Yudhishthir was made the crown prince, Shakuni tried to burn the Pandavas in a building made of Lakshya by setting them on fire, but with the help of Vidur, the five Pandavas along with their mother from that burning house Walked out vahaan se ekachakra nagari main jaakar ve muni ke vesh main ek brahman ke ghar main nivas karne lage
 Then after killing the demon named Buck, at the behest of Vyas ji, he went to Panchal-kingdom, where Draupadi's swayamvara was about to take place
 paanchal-rajya main arjuna ke lakshya-bhedan ke kaushal se matsaybhed hone par paanchon pandavon ne draupadi ko patnirup main praapt kiya
 Except Draupadi Swayamvar's first Vidura, all Pandavas were considered dead and for this reason Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince at the behest of Shakuni
 draupadi swayamvar ke tatpashchaat duryodhana aadi ko pando ke jivit hone kaa pataa chalaa
 Pandavas sought their kingdom from the Kauravas but to avoid the crisis of civil war sabhi pandav sab prakaar kii vidyaon main praveen the
 The Pandavas conquered all directions and Yudhishthira began to rule
 unhone prachur suvarnrashi se paripurna rajasuya yajna kaa anushthan kiya
 His glory became unbearable for Duryodhana
 usne apane bhai du:shashan or vaibhav praapt suhrid karn ke kehane se shakuni ko saath le, dyut-sabha main jue main pravrutt hokar, yudhisthir ko uske bhaaiyo, draupadi or unke rajya ko kapat-dyut ke dwaara hanste-hanste jeet liya
 Duryodhana greatly insulted Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha, attempting to disarm her
 shrikrishna ne unki laaj bachai tatpashchaat draupadi sabhi logo ko shraap dene hi vaali thi parantu gandhari ne aakar aisa hone se roak diya
 At the same time Yudhishthira went into the forest with his brothers after being defeated in gambling
 vahaan unhone apni pratigya ke anusaar baarah varsh vyateet kiye
 They used to provide food to the majority of Brahmins daily in the forest as before
 athasi hajaar dwijonshhit durvasa ko paritrupt kiya
 There he was accompanied by his wife Draupadi and Purohit Dhaumaji
 barahawaan varsh bitne par ve viraat nagar main gayi
 Yudhishthira lived there as a Brahmin named 'kank', being most unfamiliar
 bhimsen rasoiyaa bane the
 Arjuna named his name 'brihannala'
 pandav patni draupadi ranivas main sairandhri ke rup main rahane lagi
 Similarly nakula-sahadeva also changed their names
 bhimsen ne ratrikaal main draupadi kaa satitv-haran karne kii ichha rakhane vaale kichak ko maar daalaa
 After that, the Kauravas started carrying Virat's cows, then Arjuna defeated them
 us samay kauravon ne pandavon ko pahchaan liya
 Sri Krishna's sister Subhadra had given birth to a son named Abhimanyu from Arjuna
 King Virat gave him his daughter Uttara
 dharmraj yudhisthir saat akshuhinee sena ke swami hokar kauravon ke saath yuddh karne ko taiyaar hue
 First Lord Krishna went to Duryodhana, the supreme anger, as the messenger
 unhone gyaarah akshuhinee sena ke swami raja duryodhana se kaha- 'rajan! You give half the kingdom to Yudhishthira or offer him only five villages; Otherwise, fight with them
 ' Listening to Shri Krishna, Duryodhana said- 'I will not even give them land equal to the tip of a needle; Yes, i will definitely fight with them
 ' Having said this, he was determined to take Lord Krishna captive
 us samay rajsabha main bhagwaan shrikrishna ne apane param durdharsh vishwaroop kaa darshan karakar duryodhana ko bhaybheet kar diya
 Vidur then went to his house to worship and greet the Lord
 tadnantar ve yudhisthir ke paas laut gayi or bole-'maharaj! aap duryodhana ke saath yuddh kijiye' The armies of Yudhishthira and Duryodhana marched into the plain of Kurukshetra
 apane vipaksh main pitamah bhishma tathaa acharya dron aadi gurujanon ko dekhakar arjuna yuddh se virat ho gayi, tab bhagwaan shrikrishna ne unase kaha-"parth! bhishma aadi gurujan shok ke yogya nahin hai
 Man's body is perishable, but the soul is never destroyed
 yah aatma hi parabrahm he
 'I am Brahman' - thus you understand that soul
 kaary kii siddhi or asiddhi main samanbhaav se rahakar karmyog kaa aashray le kshatradharm kaa paalan karo
 " shrikrishna ke aisa kehane par arjuna ratharudh ho yuddh main pravrutt hue
 They made conch shells
 duryodhana kii sena main sabase pehle pitamah bhishma senapati hue
 The commander of the Pandavas was Shikhandi
 in donon main baari yuddh chhid gaya
 The warriors of Bhishmashit Kaurava side started attacking the Pandava-side soldiers in that war and the brave Kaurava-soldiers of Pandava-side like Shikhandi started targeting their arrows
 kaurav or pandav-sena kaa vah yuddh, devasur-sangram ke samaan jaan padataa tha
 The war seemed very pleasing to the gods who stood and watched in the sky 
 bhishma ne das dinon tak yuddh karke pandavon kii adhikansh sena ko apane baanon se maar giraaya
 On the tenth day, Arjuna placed a heavy rain of arrows on Veevara Bhishma
 idhar drupad kii prerana se shikhandi ne bhi pani barasaane vaale megh kii bhanti bhishma par baanon kii jhadi laga di
 Elephants, horsemen, chariots and pedestrians on both sides were killed by each other's arrows
 bhishma kii mrityu unki ichha ke adheen thi
 When the Pandavas understood that they could not win this war while being Bhishma, then on the suggestion of Shri Krishna, he asked Bhishma Pitamah for his death
 He said that as long as i have an weapon in my hand, no one can beat me except Mahadev
 It was he who suggested to the Pandavas that in front of Shikhamandi, fight the war
 He knew that Shikhandi was Amba in her previous birth, so he considered her as a girl
 10ve din ke yuddh main arjuna ne shikhandi ko aage apane rath par bithaaya
 shikhandi ko aage dekh kar bhishma ne apana dhanush tyaag diya
 After abandoning his weapon, Arjun put him to sleep on the bed of the arrow
 ve uttarayan kii pratiksha main bhagwaan vishnu kaa dhyaan or stvan karte hue samay vyateet karne lage
 When Duryodhana was distraught with grief after Bhishma fell on his bed, Acharya Drona assumed the charge of generalship
 udhar harsh manaati hui pandavon kii sena main dhridhyumna senapati hue
 Both of them had a fierce war, which was to increase the population of Yamlok
 viraat or drupad aadi raja dronrupi samudr main dub gayi
 At that time, Drona looked like
 itane hi main unke kaanon main yah aawaaj aayi ki 'ashwatthama maaraa gaya'
 On hearing this, Acharya Dron gave up his weapon
 aise samay main dhridhyumna ke baanon se aahat hokar ve prithvi par gir pade Dron was very tough
 ve sampoorn kshatriyon kaa vinaash karke paanch wein din maare gayi
 Duryodhana again became angry with mourning
 us samay karn uski sena kaa karnadhaar hua
 The Pandava-army gained the dominance of Arjuna
 karn or arjuna main bhanti-bhanti ke astr-shastron kii maar-kaat se yukt mahabhayanak yuddh hua, jo devasur-sangram ko bhi maat karne vaala tha
 In the battle of Karna and Arjuna, Karna killed many of the enemies of the enemy side with his arrows; Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paata he, jaisaa kii uske guru parashuram kaa shraap tha
 Then Karna comes down to take off the wheel of his chariot and pleads with Arjuna that he should stop running arrows for a while, following the rules of war
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna se kehete hai ki karn ko koi adhikaar nahin he ki vah ab yuddh niyamon or dharm kii baat kare, jabaki swayan usne bhi abhimanyu vadh ke samay kisi bhi yuddh niyam or dharm kaa paalan nahin kiya tha
 He further said where his religion had gone when he called the divine-born Draupadi as a prostitute in front of the entire Kuru Rajya Sabha
 dhyut-krida bhawan main uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha
 So now he has no right to talk about any religion or war rules and he told Arjuna that Karna is helpless now so he should kill him
 shrikrishna kehete hai ki yadi arjuna ne is nirnaayak mode par abhi karn ko nahin maaraa to sambhawatah pandav use kabhi bhi nahin maar sakenge or yah yuddh kabhi bhi nahin jeeta ja sakegaa
 Then, Arjuna beheaded Karna using a divine weapon
 karn ke sharir ke bhoomi par girane ke baad ek jyoti karn ke sharir se nikali or surya main samahit ho gai
 
 tadnantar raja shalya kaurav-sena ke senapati hue, kintu ve yuddh main aadhe din tak hi tik sake
 King Yudhishthira killed him by noon
 giraaya
 Duryodhana's entire army was killed in battle
 antatogatva uskaa bhimsen ke saath yuddh hua
 He slaughtered many soldiers etc
 on foot of Pandavas and attacked Bhimsen
 us samay gada se prahaar karte hue duryodhana ke anya chote bhai bhi bhimsen ke hi haath se maare gayi the
 On that eighteenth day of the Mahabharata War, Mahabali Ashwatthama put to sleep a sleeping Akshohini army of Pandavas forever
 usne draupadi ke paanchon putron, uske paanchaladeshiy bandhuon tathaa dhridhyumna ko bhi jivit nahin choda
 Draupadi started crying and crying without being sonless
 tab arjuna ne seenk ke astr se ashwatthama ko parrast karke uske mastak kii mani nikaal lee
 
 ashwatthama itane par bhi dusht ashwatthama ne uttara ke garbh ko nasht karne ke liye us par astr kaa prayog kiya
 The womb was often burnt by his weapon; But Lord Krishna gave him life again
 uttara kaa vahi garbhasth shishu aage chalakar raja pareekshith ke naam se vikhyath hua
 Kritavarma, Kripacharya and Ashwatthama - these three Kauravapakshi Vir survived from that battle
 duusari ore paanch pandav, saatyaki tathaa bhagwaan shrikrishna-ye saat hi jivit rah sake; duusare koi nahin bache
 At that time, the ornate of orphaned women was spreading everywhere
 bhimsen aadi bhaaiyon ke saath jaakar yudhisthir ne unhen santvana di tathaa ranbhumi main maare gayi sabhi veeron kaa dah-sanskaar karke unke liye jalanjali de dhan aadi kaa daan kiya
 After this, Yudhishthira went to Santhanunandan Bhishma, who was sitting on the Sharyasya in Kurukshetra and heard from him all the peaceful religion, Rajdharma, Moksha Dharma and Danadharma
 phir ve rajsinghaasana par asin hue
 After this, those Shatru Mardhana King performed Ashwamedha Yagna and donated a lot of money to Brahmins in it
 tadnantar dwarka se laute hue arjuna ke mukh se moosalkand ke kaaran praapt hue shaap se parsparik yuddh dwaara yadavon ke sanhaar kaa samachar sunakar yudhisthir ne pareekshith ko rajasan par bithaaya or swayan bhaaiyon ke saath mahaprasthaan kar swarglok ko chale gayi
 When Yudhishthira ascended the throne, Dhritarashtra entered the vanaprastha-ashram from the grihastha-ashram and went into the forest
 unke saath devi gandhari or prutha bhi thim
 Vidur ji be envious of the forest of heaven
 is prakaar bhagwaan vishnu ne prithvi kaa bhaar utaara or dharm kii sthapana tathaa adharm kaa naash karne ke liye pandavon ko nimitt banaakar daanav-daitya aadi kaa sanhaar kiya
 Later, Yadavakul, who increased the role, was also killed by pestle under the pretext of cursing Brahmins
 aniruddh ke putr vajra ko raja ke pad par abhishikt kiya
 Subsequently, with the request of the deities, Srihari in Prabhaskshetra himself worshiped the leela of the gross body and worshiped his abode in Indraloka and Brahmaloka, worshiped by the deities
 balbhadra ji sheshnag ke swaroop the, at: unhone patalrupi swarg kaa aashray liya
 The imperishable Lord Srihari is the goal of meditating men
 unke antardhan ho jane par samudr ne unke nijee nivasasthaan ko chhod kar shesh dwarkapuri ko apane jal main dubaa diya
 Arjuna cremated the dead Yadavas and gave Jalanjali for them and donated money etc
 bhagwaan shrikrishna kii raniyon ko, jo pehle apsaraayen thim or ashtavakra ke shaap se manvirup main prakat hui thim, lekar hastinapur ko chale
 The Bhilas carrying the poles on the road disdained Arjuna and took them all away
 yah bhi ashtavakra ke shaap se hi sambhav hua tha
 This caused great grief in Arjun's mind
 phir maharishi vyas ke santvana dene par unhen yah nishchay hua ki 'bhagavan shrikrishna ke sameep rahane se hi mujhamen bal tha
 On coming to Hastinapur, he requested all the news to the King Yudhishthira, who followed the Prajavarga, along with the brothers
 ve bole- Brother! He is the bow, he is the arrow, he is the chariot, and he is the horse, but without Lord Krishna, everything is destroyed in the same way as the donation given to Ashrotriya
 ' yah sunakar dharmraj yudhisthir ne rajya par pareekshith ko sthapit kar diya After this, the wise king, considering the impermanence of the world, took Draupadi and the brothers together and proceeded towards the Himalayas on the path of Mahaprasthana
 us mahapath main kramash: draupadi, sahadev, nakul, arjuna or bhimsen ek-ek karke gir pade
 The king became sombre due to this
 tadnantar ve indra ke dwaara laaye hue rath par arudh ho bhaaiyon sahit swarg ko chale gayi
 They saw all the sons of Dhritarashtra, including Duryodhana, over there
 tadnantar bhagwaan vasudev kaa bhi darshan kiya isse unhen badi prasannataa huin yah maine tumhen mahabharat kaa prasang sunaaya he
 The person who will recite this prayer will be honoured in heaven

 san 1980 main nobel puraskaar vijeta bhautik vigyaani louis walter alvarez, unke bhu-vigyaani putr walter alvarez, or rasayan vigyaani frank asaaro or hellen mishael ne apane ek adhyayan main duniya bhar kii paratdaar shilaon par jaanch kari or paaya ki unamem ke-piji seemaa vaali parat main atyaadhik iridium naamak dhaatu kaa sankendran tha
 This metal is rarely found in the upper surfaces of the earth
 paaya gaya ki kai shilaon kii ke-piji seemaa main ausat se 30 guna se lekar 120 guna iridium kaa jamaavada upasthit tha
 There is no known reason for this assemblage to be born on the earth itself because iridium is an element attracted to iron, so most of its quantity went to the center of being attracted by the iron present in the core at the time of earth's construction
 lekin is se miltaa-julata iridium sankendran kai kshudragrahon main miltaa he
 Scientists estimated the amount of iridium inhabiting the K-PG range of the entire world and calculated that the asteroid that struck it to bring it to Earth must have been at least 10 km, and its strike hit 10 nil tons of TNT
 Must have exploded loudly
 tulana ke liye yah maanav dwaara kiye gayi sabase shaktishaalee hidrogen bam ke dhamaake se 20 lakh guna adhik he
 The evidence for this theory of Alvarez's comet collision also appears to be correct, given that the enormous amount of iridium found in the chondrite, meteorite, and asteroids, which is approximately ~ 455 degrees per billion, is found in the upper layers of the Earth at ~ 0
3 The share is much more than per billion

 Because of this strike, a great cloud of dust must have spread all over the world, including fine droplets of sulfur
