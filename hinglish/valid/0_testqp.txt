 dhyani budhon kii sankhya paanch he, jinke naam kramash: vairochan, akshobh, ratnasambhav, amitabh or amodhsiddhi hai
 Some texts also enumerate a sixth meditative Buddha Vajrasattva
 dhyani budhon kaa udgam adibuddha ke paanch skandh he
 According to the instrument, the format of these meditative Buddhas is the same, the difference between them is considered based on their different colors and postures
 puujavidhan main vairochan ko chhod shesh chaaron stupa ke chaturdik sthit kar puuje jate hai
 The condition of restriction remains in the middle
 kabhi kabhi inaki upasna pruthak pruthak rup se hoti thi

 dhyani budhon kaa maanushi budhon se kya sambandh he, thik thik nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The number of manushi buddhas is also different from sectarianism
 kintu antim saat maanushi buddha buddha devpariwaar main vishesh mahatv rakhte hai
 Along with him are his Buddhasakti and the Bodhisattvas, whose number are as follows: uparyukt maanushi budhon, shaktiyon or bodhisatvon main keval shakyasingh or unakin yashodhara tathaa unke bodhisattva anand kii hi aitihaasikta siddh he

 Dootavakyam is a well-known poem by Sanskrit's oldest playwright Mahakavi Bhasa
 isaki gananaa drishyakavyon ke antargat kii jaati he
 On examining the envoy from the point of view of drama, it is placed under the metaphor-distinction called 'vyayoga'
 vyayog kii paribhaasha dete hue acharya vishwanath ne kaha he- That is, Vyayoga is the metaphor in which the famous chronicle is selected
 purush paatro kii adhikta or streepatro kii nunata hoti he, garbh or vimarsh sandhiyon kii yojana apekshit nahin hoti or puri rachana ek ank main samaapt hoti he
 It describes such a war in which the woman is not an instrument
 isamen kaishiki vritti kaa abhaav hota he
 Its hero is an eminent person of slow nature or some Rajarshi or Devpurush
 isamen shringaar, hasya or shant rason ke atirikt anya koi ras mukhya hota he
 The main signs of 'vyayoga' can be seen in the messenger
 isaki kathavstu mahabharat kii katha ke us ansh se lee gayi he jisamen bhagavan shrikrishna pandavon ke doot banakar kauravon kii sabha main jate hai
 In this metaphor, there is an absolute lack of Stipatras
 isamen rajya ke vibhaajan ko lekar yuddh kii charchaa he
 Duryodhana of the Kauravas is the hero of the Duryodhana of nature
 isamen shringaar or shant rason kii nahin, vir ras kii pradhanta he
 This metaphor has only one digit
 sanskrit roopak ke mukhya rup se teen tatva hote hai- kathavstu, netaa or ras
 Sanskrit plays have been played on the stage since ancient times, so in their evaluation, stage-worthiness is also given due importance from the point of view of acting
 kathavstu roopak kaa mukhya tatva he
 It can be any type of eminent, product or mishra
 vyayog naamak roopak main praayah prasiddh itivrutt hota he
 Mahakavi Bhasa has taken the story of the envoy from the industry festival of Mahabharata
 mahabharat kii mul katha is prakaar he- After losing at Dutikrida, the Pandavas returned after fulfilling the condition of spending twelve years in exile and one year in exile
 jab unhone kauravon se apane hisse kaa rajya maanga, to duryodhana ne asweekaar kar diya
 Efforts of agreement between the Kauravas and the Pandavas began
 jab yah kaary saralata se sampann hota na dikhaa, tab yudhisthir ne vinaashkari shuddh ke sthaan par kauravon ke saath sandhi karwaane ke uddeshy se shrikrishna se unka doot banane kaa nivedan kiya
 Dhritarashtra made full arrangements to welcome him as his messenger when he reached Hastinapur
 shrikrishna pehle kunti ke paas gayi, phir duryadhan aadi ke paas
 He stayed at Vidur's house, where he heard that the Kauravas were fully prepared for war and they were not ready to accept anything of Shri Krishna; Therefore, the Krishna karma will go in vain
 phir bhi ve duusare din vidura ke saath rajsabha main upasthit hue
 When all the members sat in place, they told Dhritarashtra that they had come to negotiate peace with the Kauravas on behalf of the Pandavas
 shrikrishna ne duryodhana ke aage pandavon ko daybhag dene kaa prastaav rakhaa
 The Kaurava chiefs Bhishma, Drona, Vidur and Dhritarashtra also asked Duryodhana to give away the Pandavas, but Durvinit Duryodhana was not willing to give the Pandavas land equal to the point of needle
 sandhi kaa prastaav thukraa kar unase nirnay ko yuddh par hi chhod dene kii baat kii
 He became angry and ignored the talk of Gandhari and left the Raj Sabha with his brothers
 kisi prakaar vidura kii prarthana par vah punah rajsabha main aayaa
 Again he asked Shakuni, Karna, Dushasasana etc
 to make Sri Krishna a prisoner
 kisi prakaar dhritaraashta ne use is nindaneey karm se roka
 Then Shri Krishna showed his Virat form, which was seen by the blind Dhritarashtra, Drona, Bhishma, Vidura and Sanjay by the grace of Shri Krishna
 dhritaraashta ne shrikrishna ke charnon main sir rakhkar kshamaa maangi
 Returning to the Pandavas, Shri Krishna described the failure of his compromise
 ‘dootvaakya’ main kavi ne mahabharat ke isi kathansh ko kuch bhinn rup main prastut kiya he- nandipath ke pashchaat pravisht hua sutaradhar jaise hi kuch batalaane ja rahaa tha ki tabhi use nepathy se kuch shabd sunai padataa he
 It is known from him that there has been opposition between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, and for this, by order of Duryodhana, his servant is arranging the Mantrasala
 duryodhana ek vir raja ke rup main rangamanch par upasthit hota he
 He sits in the synagogue with respect to all invited kings and councilors
 sabhi sabhaasadon ke bich shakuni ke suzav par bhishma senapati chune jate hai
 At the same time Kanchukali Badarayan informs about the arrival of Purushottam Narayan as the messenger from the Pandavas' camp
 shrikrishna ko narayan kehane par duryodhana krodhit ho uthta he or kanchukeey se kahata he ki kaho ki keshav naamak doot aayaa he
 Later he asks the kings present how we should behave with Krishna
 unke aadarsuchak uttar ko sunakar vah punah uttejit ho uthta he or kahata he ki krishna ko bandi bana lenaa hi use ruchikar he
 He commands that no one will rise from his posture with respect to Keshav
 yadi kisi ne aisa kiya to use rajya kii ore se kathin dand diya jaayegaa
 To prevent himself from getting up, he asks Badarayan to draw a curtain of Draupadi's hair which he can see while sitting
 chitrapat ko dekhte hue vah draupadi, yudhisthir, bhim, arjuna, nakul-sahadev, shakuni, acharya aadi kii bhav-bhangimaaon kaa chithran karata he
 At the behest of Duryodhana, the Kanchukali messenger goes to take Krishna
 duryadhan karn se krishna ke nari jaise mridu vachan sunne ko taiyaar hone ko kahata he
 All the kings and Kshatriyas stand in panic as Shri Krishna enters the assembly
 duryodhana bhi apane asana se gir jaataa he
 Vasudeva Krishna requests all the kings to take postures with respect
 draupadi ke kesh or vastra khinchne ke chitra ko duryodhana ke paas dekhakar ve man hi man uski bhartsana karte hai ki apane hi kul ke bandhuon ke apmaan karne ko morrkhtaa ke kaaran duryadhan apana parakram samajhataa he
 Under the formal skilfulness, Vasudev tells the message of the Pandavas that 'what is our duty, we should get
 ’ duryodhana kahata he ki ‘pandu ko munishaap mila tha atah pandav to devputra hai phir hamaare bandhu kaise hue? unka pita ke dhan main kya adhikaar?’ vasudev duryodhana se poochhate hai ki dhritaraashta bhi apane pita vichitraveery ke dhan ke uttaradhikari kaise ho sakate hai? duryodhana vasudev ko unke bal-krityon par bhi ulaahna dene lagata he
 Duryodhana and Bokhla are swayed by the rational candor of Sri Krishna
 vah kahata he ki rajya bhiksha main praapt karne kii vastu nahin
 He will not give even the state's tarmac to the Pandavas
 vasudev usko chetavanee dete hue kehete hai ki tumhaare kaaran sampoorn kuruvansh kaa sheeghra hi vinaash ho jayega
 They begin to leave
 duryodhana unako bandi banane kii ajna detaa he
 Vasudeva appears in Vishwaroop
 duryoghan unki maaya se or adhik chakra jaataa he or baahar nikal jaataa he
 Vasudev gets angry and calls Sudarshan Chakra, he appears in human form
 sudarshan ke samajhane par vasudev prakrutistha hote hai
 Anant Vasudeva's divinity horn Dhanush, Kaumodaki Gada, Panchajanya Shankh and Nandak Asi enter one after the other and return to Sudarshan's explanation
 phir vishnuvaahan garud kaa pravesh hota he
 Seeing the peace of God, all return to their respective dhams
 baad main shrikrishna bhi pandavon ke shivi main lautne lagate hai ki tabhi vruddh dhritaraashta kaa pravesh hota he
 Dhritarashtra falls at the feet of Vasudev and apologizes for the crime of sons
 bharatvakya ke saath dootvaakya roopak samaapt hota he
 When we compare the story of Dutvakya with the original story of Mahabharata, we see some fundamental changes made by Mahakavi Bhasa
 mahabharat main dhritaraashta raja hai, ve krishna ke doot rup main aane par rajsinghaasana par baithte hai jabaki dootvaakya main duryodhana ko raja ke rup main avatarit kiya gaya he
 The picture poet related to Draupadi's hairstyle and clothing in the envoy is the origin of the poet
 mahabharat main shrikrishna ko bandi banane kaa koi vishesh praytn nahin kiya jaataa he jabaki dootvaakya main unako baandhne kaa praytn dikhaaya gaya he
 The embodiment of divine armaments and vehicle Garuda in human form in the envoy is the poet's own imagination
 kavi ne shrikrishna or duryodhana ke lambe vaartalap ko atyant vyangypurna or rochak bana diya he
 With all these innovations, the story and dialogues of the envoy have become beautiful and effective
 doot ke rup main upasthit shrikrishna ke vaakya arthath sandhi -prastaav par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran is roopak kaa naam ‘dootvaakya’ sarvatha sarthak he
 The Gwala or Boatis planetarium is a constellation appearing in the northern part of the celestial sphere

 parantu shaasha ke rup main vah bada nikamma niklaa or bhogavilas main adhik ruchi rakhane laga
 He left worrying about the expansion of the prestige of the administration and dynasty, even leaving the responsibility of administration in the hands of his younger brother Dhruva
 swaabhaavik tha ki dhruv is paristhiti se laabh uthaata
 Even without receiving the orders of his elder brother and the king, he himself started donating land etc
 and publicized many donations in his name
 dhruv kii in pravritiyon se govind dwitiya kaa uske prati andeh utpann ho jaay, yah kuch apratyaashit tha or vah apane pad se hataa diya gaya
 The growing mood of the two brothers had an impact on the growing sense of independence in the Samatans
 dhruv ne is paristhiti se laabh uthaaya or samrajya tathaa vansh kii pratishtha kii raksha kaa bahaanaa banaakar usne khulaa vidroh kar diya
 Govind II sought assistance from the kings of Kanchi, Gangwadi, Vengi and Malwa, but Dhruva was successful despite his military support
 govind dwitiya sainik sangh or dhruv kii senaaon ke bich yuddh kahan hua, yah nishchit nahin he, parantu vah tha nirnaayak or usamen dhruv kii vijay hui
 What he did to his brother in return for victory is also not known, but he took away his throne and presumably became himself in 780 AD

 lok prashasan kaa raajnneeti vigyaan ke samaanaantar adhyayan ke ek kshetra ke rup main pradurbhaav hone tathaa ek alag shaikshanik vibhaag ke rup main ubharne ke saath hi, 1960 ke dashak main saarvajanik niti ko raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat adhyayan ke ek upakshetra ke naate manyata mili
 'public policy' is a theoretical study of the government's attitude towards public affairs
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa bal siddhanth par, tathaa sajrvanik niti kaa bal uske anuprayog par hota he
 As a result of the behavioral revolution in political science, 'relevance' has become a central topic of study for most political scientists
 raajnneeti shastriyon ne, visheshkar sanyukt rajya america main, chathe dashak ke uttararddh main mahasoos kiya ki samaaj ke saamne upasthiti kai sankatkalin samasyaon kaa hal nikaalane kii atyadhik aavashyaktaa he
 For example, the US involvement in Vietnam was a scary experience for the American public
 vishwa bhar main hathiyaaron kii daud ne vishwa ke astitv tak ko bade khatre main daal diya
 Ethnic problems have become a major challenge for many societies
 sanyukt rajya america or rus jaisi mahashaktiyon dwaara liye gaye nirnyon kii parinti yuddh yaa shanti, aarthik unnati yaa ant, parmaanu vidhwans yaa shantipurna sah astitv main ho sakati he
 Political scientists have realized the potential dangers and positive benefits of public policy and have come to the conclusion that the study and analysis of public policies is highly needed
 sarkarein in uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kai nitiyaan bana sakati he or kosh uplabdh kara sakati hai
 Even then, mere enactment of legislation and passing of budget will not prove that the desired objectives will be achieved
 bhartiya yojanaon main hameshaa hi uddeshyon or uplabdhiyon ke madhya ek bada interval rahata he
 The reasons for those failures have to be analyzed
 saral rup main vyakt karnaa ho to, sawarjanik niti sarkaron kii gatividhiyon kaa yoga he, chaahe sarkaar swayan kaary karti he yaa abhikarta ke madhyam se kaary karti he
 Public policy has an impact on the lives of citizens
 sarakaren jo kuch bhi karnaa yaa nahin karnaa pasand karti hai vahiin sawarjanik niti he
 Political scientist David Easton has defined public policy as the "maximization of large sums of money for the whole society"
 raajnneeti vaigyanik henj eula evam kenith previt saarvajanik niti kii ek anya paribhaasha dete hai
 According to him the policy can be defined as 'permanent construction'
 saarvajanik niti kaa vishleshan praayah nitigat nirnay yaa niti kathan ke parinaamon ke prakaash main kiya jaataa he
 The policy outcome is a true expression of public policy
 saral shabdon main, nitigat parinaam sarkaar dwaara jo kuch vastav main kiya jaataa he, usko pradarshit karte hai
 Public policies are an overall depiction of a political system
 sawarjanik niti kaa parichaalit kshetra atishay vistrut hota he tathaa isi ke pahunch or vyapti paryaapt vrahat hoti he
 Look at any aspect of human life, we cannot get rid of any one or the other policy
 bachche ke janm se lekar manushya kii mrityu tak or jab bhi jab mritak sharir antim sanskaron ke liye shamshaan grih laayaa jaataa he, koi na koi niti hoti he jiskaa saamana hamen karnaa padataa he or jiskaa laabh ham uthaate hai
 Child education, prevention of diseases, better and nutritious food, good clothes, best higher education, job prospects, better salary, adequate housing, home and other facilities, protection from national and international hazards and prevention of natural disasters are some of the policies whose We discuss it easily
 anya rashtiy shaktiyon par anyonyashray ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, kisi raajnneetik pranali kii saarvajanik nitiyaan aayaat-niryaat se sambandhit tathaa anya raashton se achche evam maitreepurn sambandhon se sambandhit nitiyon ko bhi apane main sammilit karti he
 It is difficult to define or define the scope and reach of public policy in words
 saarvajanik niti apni gatividhiyon ke bade hisse main unako shaamil karti he jo vikaas niti se susangat hoti hai
 Major principles such as socio-economic development, equality, freedom or self-determination or guidance of activities can be accepted as development policy or national goal
 saarvajanik niti sankeern ho sakati he, jab isamen kisi ek vishisht gatividhi jaise parivaar-niyojan ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 Public policy can be applied to all the people of the country or to a limited class of people
 saarvajanik niti sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak rup main ho sakati he
 In a positive way it can be in the form of direct governmental action to solve a specific problem
 duusari taraf, yah apane nakaaratmak rup main sarkari karmchaaree dwaara, us vishay par jiske bare main koi shaskeey aadesh apekshit tha, koi kaarywahi nahin karnaa sammilit karti he
 Public policy, thus, has a statutory oppressive quality that citizens consider to be legally justified
 udaahranarth, karon kaa bhugtan avashya kiya janaa chahie anyathaa jail yatra yaa jurmaane kaa khatra uthaane ko taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 This legal form of public policy makes oppressive public organizations different from private organizations
 loktantric vyavastha main sarkaar sampoorn samaaj ke pratibimb ke sivaay kuch bhi nahin he
 The government has many areas of administration, such as education, defense, finance etc
 prayek kshetra ke liye yaa kisi vishisht kshetra ke liye sarkaar nitiyon kaa nirupan karti he jinhen saamanyatya saarvajanik nitiyon se janaa jaataa he
 If the policy is long term then the objective will also be determined accordingly
 udhaaharan ke liye, pratiraksha sambandhi niti main dderghaavadhi uddeshy dhyaan main rakhe jaavenge
 These long term objectives can be of excellent recruitment, proper training, proper arrangement etc
 isi tarah shiksha, swasthya, vitt evam parivaar kalyaan aadi se sambandhit nitiyon ke uddeshyon kaa nirdhaaran bhi dderghaavadhi aadhaar par kiya jaavega
 Some problems arise by chance
 is tarah ke maamalon main nitiyon kaa nirupan laghu avadhi ke uddeshyon ke saath kiya jaataa he
 For example, blackouts are ordered during wartime and people are removed from nearby villages in border areas
 isi tarah, yadi kahin hinsa bhadak uthati he to police, laghuvadhi ke uddeshyon ke aadhaar par vahaan vidhi evam nyaay vyavastha kii punarsthapana karti he
 For a holistic understanding of public policy, a combination of public policy scenarios and environmental forces must be analyzed
 saarvajanik niti ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhane kii ghor aavashkata he
 Indeed in the modern world, public policies determine the destiny of mankind
 maanav maatr kaa kalyaan tathaa aarthik uddhaar, saarvajanik niti kii nipunata par nirbhar he
 If unskilled policies were continued year after year, those policies would contribute to the deterioration of the economic standard of the people
 akushal nitiyon ko chhodana hi hoga
 It is to adopt public policies with the right goals

 Paving of the Mediterranean Sea is about 1 km below the Atlantic, and the current would have plunged into the Mediterranean Sea with a 1000-meter-per-second sea-water roar

 At the time when there were new ideas about the religion of Lord Mahavira and Buddha in India, a reformer was born in China, named Confucius
 us samay china main jhou rajvansh kaa basant or sharad kaal chal rahaa tha
 Over time, the power of the Zhou dynasty had become weak, many states were established in China, which always fought among themselves, which came to be called the era of quarreling states
 atah china kii praja bahut hi ksht jhel rahi thi
 At such a time, Mahatma Confucius emerged to teach morality lessons to the people of China
 inkaa janm isa messiah ke janm se kareeb 550 varsh pehle china ke shandong pradesh main hua tha
 His father died in childhood
 unke gyaan kii aakanksha aseem thi
 They had to acquire knowledge by suffering a lot
 17 varsh kii umr main unhen ek sarkari naukari mili
 After a few years, he left the government job and started teaching
 ghar main hi ek vidhyalay kholkar unhone vidhyaarthiyon ko shiksha dena prarambh kiya
 He used to teach students history, poetry and ethics orally
 unhone kavy, itihaas, sangeet or nitishastra par kai pustakon kii rachana kii
 He was the ruler of a city in Lu State at the age of 53 and later he was appointed as a minister
 mantri hone ke naate inhone dand ke badale manushya ke charitra sudhaar par bal diya
 Confucius gave the message of truth, love and justice to his disciples
 ve sadachaar par adhik bal dete the
 He used to inspire people to become humble, benevolent, virtuous and characterful
 They used to ask elders and ancestors to respect them
 He used to say don't treat others like you don't want to do with yourself
 kanceyucious ek sudhaarak the, dharm prachaarak nahin
 He did not give any teachings about God, but still later people started considering him as a religious teacher
 inaki mrityu 480 i
 pus
 main ho gai thi
 Confucian social reformers preached a stability in Chinese society
 kanceyucious kaa darshan shaastra aaj bhi chini shiksha ke liye path pradarshak bana hua he
 The Confucians never thought it necessary to give their ideas in writing
 uskaa mat tha ki vah vichaaron kaa vaahak ho saktaa he, unka srashta nahin
 He was a worshiper of archeology, because he thought that only through this can real knowledge be gained
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya ko uske samast kaaryakalapon ke liye niyam apane andar hi praapt ho sakate hai
 Not only for the individual, but the rules and patterns of improvement and correct development of the whole society can be found in the words and work of the ancient Mahatmas
 kanfushas ne koi aisa lekh nahin choda jisamen uske dwaara pratipaadit naitik evam saamaajik vyavastha ke siddhanton kaa nirupan ho
 But all the information related to it is found in books called 'the Principle of Average' written by his grandson Tje Sje and 'mahan Shiksha' written by his disciple Tsong Sin
 'basant or patjhad' naamak ek granth, jise lu kaa itivrutt bhi kehete hai, kanfushas kaa likhaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 This entire work is well received and although very small, it is considered ideal for brief histories of China
 kanfushas ke shishyon kii sankhya sab milakar praaia: 3,000 tak pahunch gai thi, kintu unamem se 75 ke lagbhag hi ucch koti ke pratibhashali vidvan the
 His dear disciples used to stay near him
 ve uske aasapaas shraddhapurvak uthte-baithte the or uske aacharan kii sookshm visheshtaon par dhyaan diya karte the tathaa uske mukh se nikali vaani ke prayek shabd ko hridyangam kar lete or usapar manan karte the
 He used to study ancient history, poetry and social practices of the country from him
 kanfushas kaa kahana tha ki kisi desh main acha shashan or shanti tabhi sthapit ho sakati he jab shaasha, mantri tathaa janata kaa prayek vyakti apane sthaan par uchit kartavyon kaa paalan karata rahe
 The ruler should be the ruler in the true sense, the minister should be the minister in the true sense
 kanfushas se ek baar poocha gaya ki yadi use kisi pradesh ke shashansutra ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar saunpa jaae to vah sabase pehla koun sa mahatvapurn kaary karegaa
 His answer for this was - 'improvement of Names'
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo jis naam ke pad par pratishthit ho use us pad se sanlagn sabhi kartavyon kaa vidhiwat paalan karnaa chahie jisase uskaa vah naam sarthak ho
 He had full faith in the power of example and ideal
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki adarsh vyakti apane sadacharan se jo udhaaharan prastut karte hai, aam janata unke saamne nishchay hi jhuk jaati he
 If the ruler of a country is made well aware of what he should do and how to do governance, then surely he can improve his conduct and make his state happy by presenting his example, Can make it rich and prosperous
 isi vishwaas ke bal par kanfushas ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi koi shaasha 12 maheene ke liye use apana mukhya paramarshdaata bana le to vah bahut kuch karke dikhaa saktaa he or yadi use teen varsh kaa samay diya jaae to vah apane aadarsho or aashaaon ko moort rup pradaan kar saktaa he
 Confucius never claimed that he received any divine power or divine messages
 vah keval is baat kaa chintan karata tha ki vyakti kya he or samaaj main uske kartavya kya hai
 He never mentioned power performance, extraordinary and non-human powers, rebellious tendencies and deities
 uskaa kathan tha ki budhimatta kii baat yahi he ki prayek vyakti purna uttardayitv or eemaandaaree se apane kartavya kaa paalan kare or devi devataaon kaa aadar karte hue bhi unase alag rahe
 He was of the opinion that the person who cannot serve human beings will serve the Gods and Goddesses
 use apane or dusron ke sabhi kartavyon kaa purna dhyaan tha, isiilie usne kaha tha ki bura aadmi kabhi bhi shashan karne ke yogya nahin ho saktaa, bhale hi vah kitna bhi shaktisampann ho
 The ruler punishes those who violate the rules, but he should never forget that there is no power other than the power to present his ideal of good conduct
 kanfushas ke darshanik, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik vichaaron par aadhaarit mat ko kanfooshivaad yaa kungaphutsiwad naam diya jaataa he
 According to Confucian, goodness is a natural quality of man
 manushya ko yah swaabhaavik gun ishwar se praapt hua he
 Therefore, to act according to this nature is to respect God's will and to not act accordingly is to disobey God

 This welfare form of Parambrahm is worshiped for the highest quality Siddhas, autobiographical seekers and common believer people-everyone is supremely happy, ultimate welfare, all-encompassing and best
 shastron main ullekh miltaa he ki dev, danuj, rishi, maharishi, yogindra, munindra, siddh, gandharv hi nahin, apitu brahma-vishnu tak in mahadev kii upasna karte hai
 According to this Purana, this Purana is the ultimate scripture
 ise is bhootal par bhagwaan shiv kaa vaanmay swaroop samajhnaa chaiye or sab prakaar se iskaa seven karnaa chaiye
 The reading and hearing of this is by all means entirety
 isse shiv bhakthi paakar shreshthatam sthiti main pahunchaa hua manushya sheeghra hi shivpad ko praapt kar letaa he
 That is why, by doing all the diligence, humans have desired to read this Purana - or have considered its study as a desirable means
 isi tarah iskaa prempurvak shravan bhi sampoorn manovanchit falon ke denevaala he
 By listening to this Purana of Lord Shiva, a person is freed from all sins and in this life consumes great pleasures and attains Shivaloka at the end
 yah shivpurana naamak granth choubees hajaar shlokon se yukt he
 This divine Shiva Purana with seven codes is seated like Parabrahma Parmatma and is the most excellent impeller

06 Rukhla Atrauli is a village in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 sar saiyad ahamed khan hindustani shikshak or netaa the jinhone bharat ke musalamaanon ke liye aadhunik shiksha kii shuruyaat kii
 He founded the Muhammadan anglo-oriental College which later developed into the Aligarh Muslim University
 unke prayaason se aligarh kranti kii shuruyaat hui, jisamen shaamil muslim buddhijiviyon or netaaon ne bhartiya musalamaanon ko hinduon se alag karne kaa kaam kiya or pakistan kii neenv daali
 Sayyid Ahmad Khan became very famous while working in the East India Company
 sayed ahamed 1857 ke pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke samay british samrajya ke vafaadaar bane rahe or unhone bahut se europiyon kii jaan bachaai
 Later on he wrote a book about the struggle: asabab-e-bagwat-e-hind, in which he criticized the policies of the British government
 ye apane samay ke sabase prabhaavshaalee muslim netaa the
 He thought that the Muslims of India should not be loyal to the British government
 unhone urdu ko bhartiya musalamaanon kii samuhik bhashaa banane par jor diya
 Syed Ahmed Khan was born on 17 October 1817 in Sadat Khanadan, Delhi
 unhe bachapan se hi padhane likhane kaa shauq tha or un par pita kii tulana main maan kaa vishesh prabhaav tha
 The effect of the mother's efficient upbringing and the rites she received was evident in the days following Sir Syed, when he came to the field of social upliftment
 22 varsh kii avasthaa main pita kii mrityu ke baad parivaar ko aarthik kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa or thodi si shiksha ke baad hi unhen aajeevika kamaane main laganaa padaa
 He started working as a clerk in the East India Company in 1830 AD, but in 1841 AD he qualified as a Deputy Judge in Mainpuri and worked in the judicial departments at various places
 haalanki sarvocch ohade par hone ke baavzood apni sari zindagi unhone fatehali main guzaari
 He saw with his own eyes the consequences of the great revolution of 1857 and its failure
 unka ghar tabah ho gaya, nikat sambandhiyon kaa qatl hua, unki maan jaan bachaakar ek saptaah tak ghode ke astabal main chuphi raheen
 Seeing this ruin of his family, his mind got distracted and a wave of patriotism started taking place in his heart and mind
 is bechaini se unhone pareshaan hokar bharat chhodane or misr main basane kaa faisalaa kiya
 The British sent Mir Sadiq and Mir Rustom Ali to him to lure them towards him and lured him to give Talluka Jehanabad
 yah aisa mauqaa tha ki ve inke jaal main fas sakate the
 He could live the life of a wealthy man, but he was a very intelligent and intelligent person
 unhone us vaqt laalach ko buree bhalaa samajhakar thukraa di or rashtrabhakti ko apnaanaa behatar samajha
 Later he realized that if the Muslims of India were not removed from this cell, then one day our people would be ruined and ruined and they would never get up
 isliye unhone misr jane kaa iraadaa badal diya or kalyaan va astitv kii mashaal lekar apni qaom or mulq kii taraf badhane lage
 It is true that he sheltered non-military British in his home, but his supporters were not at all, but he was a lover of Islamic education and culture
 unki duuradrushti angrezon ke shadyantra se acchhee tarah se vaaqif thi
 He knew that the British rule had been established on India and he thought it better to defeat the educational ground
 isliye apane behtareen lekhon ke madhyam se qaom main shiksha va samskruti kii bhaavana jagaane kii koshish kii taaki shaikshik maidan main koi hamaari qaom par haaavee na ho sake
 The Muslims continued to give them the fatfar of Kufr, despite not becoming an enemy of its people or deteriorating, but kept trying to explain them with tenderness
 ve acchhee tarah se jaanate the ki yah qaom jaahil he, isliye unki baton kii parvaah kiye bina ve apni manzil par pahunchne ke liye koshish karte rahe
 Today the Muslim community accepts what Sir Syed Ahmad Khan did not do anything for the community
 muslim raajnneeti main sar saiyad kii parampara muslim lig ke rup main ubhari
 His propaganda against the Indian National Congress was that the Congress was a Hindu hegemony party and that Propaganda lived among the Muslims of pre-independence India
 kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar ve congress se dur rahe or yahan tak ki ve azaadi kii ladaai se bhi hissaa nahin liya
 It is no surprise that almost all the freedom fighters in the Muslim-majority states of British India such as Bengal and Punjab were Hindus or Sikhs
 inaki mrityu 27 march 1898 ko hriday gati ruk jane ke kaaran hui

 bhu-akruti vaigyanik yah samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki bhu-drishy jaise dikhte hai vaisaa dikhne ke peeche kaaran kya he, ve bhu-akritiyon ke itihaas or unki gatiki ko jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai or bhoomi avlokan, bhautik pareekshan or sankhyatmak modelling ke ek sangyojan ke madhyam se bhavishya ke badlaavon kaa purvanumaan karte hai
 Geomorphology is studied in geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archeology and geotechnical engineering and this broad base of interest generates a wide variety of research styles and interests under the subject
 prithvi kii sataha, prakritik or manvodbhav vigyaan sambandhi prakriyaaon ke sangyojan kii pratikriya swaroop vikaas karti he or saamagree jodne vaali or use hataane vaali prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke saath jawaab detii he
 Such processes can operate at different scales of place and time
 sarvaadhik vyapak paimaane par, bhu-drishy kaa nirmaan vivartanik utthan or jwalamukhi ke madhyam se hota he
 Degradation is caused by erosion and extensive waste, creating sediment that is transported and deposited to other locations within the landscape or away from the coast
 uttarottar chote paimaane par, isi tarah kii avadharana lagu hoti he, jahaan ikai bhu-akritiyaan yogashil or ghataav prakriyaaon ke santulan ke jawaab main viksit hoti hai
 Modern geomorphology is the study of the divergence of the flow of material on the surface of a planet and is therefore closely associated with sedimentology, which can similarly be seen as the convergence of that flow
 bhu-akritik prakriyaayein vivartaniki, jalwaayu, paristhitiki, or maanav gatividhiyon se prabhavit hoti hai or samaan rup se inamen se kai kaarak dharti kii sataha par chal rahe vikaas se prabhavit ho sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, isostacy yaa parvatiy varshan ke madhyam se
 Many geomorphologists take particular interest in the possibility of feedback between climate and tectonics that mediate geomorphic processes
 bhu-akruti vigyaan ke vyaavhaarik anuprayog main shaamil he sankat akalan jisamen shaamil he bhuskhalan purvanumaan or shaman, nadi niyantran or punarsthapana or tateey sangrakshan
 With a few notable exceptions, geomorphology is a relatively new science, which has been growing with interest in other aspects of geology since the mid-19th century
 is khand main kuch pramukh akritiyon or unke vikaas kii ghatnaon ke bare main ek sankshipt ruparekha pradaan kii gai he
 The polytheistic Chinese scientist and politician Shen Kuo was perhaps the earliest to discover a theory of geomorphology
 yah prashanth mahaasaagar se saikadon mile kii duuri par ek pahaad ke bhuvaigyanik parat main samudri jeevashm ke khol ke uske avlokan par aadhaarit he
 When he saw the bicolor shell moving in a horizontal extension toward the erosion section of the cliff, he theorized that the reef was once the location of a pre-historic period seaward that moved hundreds of miles over the course of several centuries
 usne nishkarsh nikaala ki vah bhoomi pahaado kii mrudaa kataav or gaad ke jamaav ke kaaran bhinn rup main punargathit hui
 He said this when he saw the strange natural erosion of Taihang Mountains and Yandang Mountains near Wenzhou
 iske alaava, jab usne pracheen ashmibhoot bans ko yanjhau, jo aaj aadhunik samay kaa yaanan, zaansi praant he, ke shushk, uttari jalwaayu kshetra main bhumigat rup se sangrakshit paaya, to usne kai sadiyon ke dauraan kramik jalwaayu parivartan ke siddhant ko prastaavit kiya
 The first use of the term geomorphology was probably in German, when it appeared in Laumann's 1858 works
 kith tinkler kaa suzav he ki jab jon westle pavel or dablue
je
 micgi ne is shabd kaa istemaal 1891 ke antarrashtriya bhuvaigyanik sammelan main kiya to yah angreji, german or french main saamaanya upyog main aa gaya
 An early popular geomorphic model was the geographic cycle or erosion cycle developed by William Morris Davis between 1884 and 1899
 yah chakra ekarupathavaad ke siddhanton se prerit tha jise sarvapratham james haton ne prastaavit kiya tha
 In relation to valley-like shapes, uniformism characterized this cycle in a sequence in which a river cuts a valley as deep as possible, but then the erosion of the side basins eventually recovers the area and reduces elevation Gives, after which regeneration can resume that cycle
 davis dwaara apane siddhant ke vikaas ke dashakon baad bhu-akruti vigyaan ke kai adhyayanon ne vyapak paimaane par bhudrishy vikaas ke liye apane vichaaron ko is saanche main baitaane kii koshish kii or unhen aaj aksar "devisian" kaha jaataa he
 Davis's ideas have largely been surpassed today, mainly because of his lack of predictive ability and qualitative nature, but he remains an extremely important figure in the history of the subject
 1920 ke dashak main, walter penk ne davis ke model kaa ek vaikalpik model viksit kiya, yah maanate hue ki sthalakriti vikaas ko utthan or anaachhadan kii satat prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke rup main behatar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, naa ki davis ke ekal utthan ke baad hone vaale kshay ke rup main
 However, due to his untimely death at a relatively young age, the controversy with Davis and the lack of an English translation of his works did not gain widespread recognition for many years
 in lekhakon ne prithvi kii sataha ke vikaas ke adhyayan ko, pehle kii tulana main adhik saamanyakrit, vishwa str par praasangik aadhaar dene kaa prayaas kiya
 In the early 19th century, authors - particularly in Europe - attributed the local climate to landforms, and specifically to glaciation and periglacial processes
 iske vipareet, davis or penk, donon ne hi samay ke saath hone vaale bhudrishy vikaas ke mahatv or alag-alag paristhitiyon main alag-alag bhu-drishyon par prithvi kii satahi prakriyaaon kii saamanyata par jor dene kaa prayaas kiya
 While Pank and Davis and their followers were writing and studying primarily in Western Europe, another, largely segregated school of geomorphology developed in the United States in the mid-20th century
 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main grove karl gilbert ke pathpradarshak kaaryon ke baad, prakritik vaigyanikon, bhuvaigyanikon or hydrolic ejiniyaron ke ek samooh ne, jisamen shaamil the ralf algar bagnold, jon hack, luna leopold, thomas medoc or arthur strolar ne bhudrishy aakaaron ke tatwon par anusandhan shuru kiya jaise ki nadi or pahari dhalaan, jiske liye unhone unke pahaluon kaa vyavasthit, pratyaksh, maatraatmak maapan liya or in maapon ke scalling kii chaanbin kii
 These methods began to allow predictions regarding the behavior of past and future landscapes based on current assessments and later evolved into quantitative geomorphology or geomorphometry
 aaj, bhu-akruti vigyaan ke kshetra main alag-alag drushtikonon or hiton kii ek bahut vyapak seemaa shaamil he
 Modern researchers try to derive quantitative "theories" that govern the Earth's surface processes, but equally, they recognize the specificity of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate
 samakaleen bhu-akruti vigyaan main vishesh mahatvapurn pratiti main shaamil hai: Modern geomorphology focuses on quantitative analysis of interrelated processes
 bhu-rasayan main aadhunik pragati, vishesh rup se cosmochemistry, isotope bhu-rasayan or fishan trek dating ne hamen pehali baar un daron ke maapan main sakasham banaaya he jis par bhu-akritik prakriyaayein, bhugarbheey rup se praasangik samayrekha par ghatit hoti hai
 At the same time, the use of more accurate physical measurement techniques, including piercing GPS, remotely sensed digital terrain models, and laser scanning techniques have allowed their quantification and study of these processes
 iske baad computer simulation or modelling kaa upyog tab yah samajhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kaise ye prakriyaayein ek saath or samyavadhi main kaam karti hai
 Most processes that are geologically relevant can be considered either erosive, translational, or a combination of the two
 Deposition processes are mostly considered within the field of sedimentology, but are often understood as part of geomorphology as well
 apkshay, prithvi kii saamagree kaa vayumandaleey yaa sataha ke nazadiiki agenton se sampark ke kaaran hone vaala rasinic or bhautik vighatan he
 The products of these changes near the surface can later be carried away by various factors of erosion
 bhu-vaigyanik dwaara jaanch kii jane vaali prakriyaaon kii prakruti, drudh rup se jaanch main shaamil bhudrishy yaa sthalakriti par or samay or lambaai rekha kii ruchi par nirbhar he
 However, the following non-detailed list provides a glimpse of the landscape elements associated with some of these
 praathmik satahi prakriyaayein jo adhikansh sthalakritik swaroopon ke liye jimmedaar he, usamen shaamil he hawa, lahar, rasinic vighatan, jan vinaash, bhoojal gatividhi, satahi jal pravaah, him karrwai, vivartaniki or jwalamukhi
 Other more serious geomorphic processes may include periglacial processes, salt-mediated action, or extraterrestrial effects
 nadiyaan or dharaaen, keval pani kii hi vaahak nahin hai balki talachat kii bhi hai
 Water, when flowing over the surface, is able to use sediments and carry them downstream, either as bottom load or suspended load, or as dissolved load
 talachat parivahan kii dar, swayan talachat kii uplabdhta or nadi ke nirvahan par nirbhar karti he
 Rivers are also capable of eroding new rocks and creating new sediments, by their bottom and coupling with the surrounding mountain slopes
 In this way, rivers are thought to be responsible for establishing the base level for large-scale landscapes in non-glacial environments
 vibhinn bhudrishy tatwon ke sampark main nadiyaan mahatvapurn sutara hai
 When rivers flow through topographies, they generally become larger in size and merge with other rivers
 is prakaar gathit nadiyon kaa network ek apvaah tantra he or aksar vrikshnuma hota he, lekin antarnihit bhuvigyaan or sthaneey sthalakriti ke aadhaar par anya swaroop bhi dhaaran kar saktaa he
 Eolian processes are related to the movement of air and, more specifically, to the ability of Hava to shape the Earth's surface
 Winds can erode, transport, and deposit things, and these winds are more effective in areas where vegetation is sparse and there is an adequate supply of sediment
 haalanki pani or brihat pravaah, adhikansh vaataavaran main hawa kii tulana main adhik chizon kaa istemaal karata he, vaiudh prakriyaayein shushk vaataavaran main mahatvapurn hai, registan
 Soils, regoliths and boulders move under the influence of gravity, crawling, rolling, flowing, falling
 aisi brihad tuutan sthaliy or dhalaanon par hoti he or inhen prithvi, mangal shukr, titan or iapets par dekha gaya he
 Processes running on mountain slopes can change the topology of the slope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes
 aisi dhalaane jo najuk sthiti tak gahari ho jaati hai ve badi maatra main saamagree ko jaldi-jaldi chhodane main sakasham ho jaati hai, jisase dhalaani prakriya vivartanik rup se sakriy kshetron main bhudrishy kaa ek mahatvapurn tatva ban jaati hai
 On Earth, biological processes such as digging or tree throws can play an important role in determining the rates of some sloping processes
 himandi, jo ki bhugolic rup se simit he, bhudrishy parivartan ke prabhavi kaarak hai
 The gradual movement of snow down the valley causes friction and uprooting of the rock below
 gharshan se maheen talachat kaa nirmaan hota he, jise himand aataa kehete hai
 The debris transported by the glacier after it is finished is called Moren
 himand kataav, you aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke liye jimmedaar he, jo ki nadi dwaara banaai gai ve aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke vipareet he
 The way glaciers process contact with other landscape elements, especially with slopes and river processes, is an important aspect of plio-pleistocene landscape development and its sediments are found in many high mountain environments
 jo vaataavaran apekshaakrit haal hi main himachhadit hue hai magar ab nahin hai, ve un bhudrushyon ke mukaable jo kabhi himachhadit nahin hue, ab bhi ucch bhudrishy parivartan dar ko dikhaa sakate hai
 Non-glacial geomorphic processes that have also been adapted by earlier glaciation are called paraglacial processes
 yah avadharana, perigleshial prakriyaaon kii virodhabhasi he, jo barf yaa paale ke nirmaan yaa pighalaav dwaara sidhe sanchalit hoti he
 The tectonic effect on geomorphology can range from millions of years to a minute or less
 bhudrishy par vivartaniki kaa prabhaav baari rup se anternihit chattani aadhaaron kii banaavat par nirbhar karata he jo is baat ko niyantrit karata he ki vivartaniki kis prakaar kii sthaneey aakaariki ko janm degi
 Earthquakes, within minutes, can inundate vast terrain and give rise to wetlands
 isostetic paltaav ke kaaran saikadon yaa hazaron saal main mahatvapurn parivartan ho saktaa he or isse parvatiy shrinkhalaa ko atirikt kataav kii anumati milti he, kyonki shrinkhalaa se bade hisse ko hataa diya jaataa he or katibandh kaa utthan hota he
 Long-term plate tectonic dynamics induce orogenic tropics, massive mountain ranges with a million-year lifespan, which are the focus of high-rate processes of river and hill slopes, and thus produce long-term depressions
 gahari papadi gatishiltaa kii visheshtaayen, jaise ki plums or nimna sthalmandal kaa gaiyr-paratbandi ko bhi mana jaataa he ki dirghakaalin avadhi main dharti kii sthalakriti ke bade paimaane par vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Both can induce regeneration through isostasy, as hot, low-density crust rocks displace the relatively cold, high-density crust rocks inside the earth
 jwalamukheey or vitaleey aagney prakriyaaon kaa bhu-akruti vigyaan par mahatvapurn prabhaav ho saktaa he
 The occurrence of the volcano renews the landscape and covers the old surface of the land with lava and tephra and releases pyroclastic material and leads the rivers to new paths
 visphoton dwaara nirmit shanku bhi paryaapt nai sthalakriti banaata he, jis par anya satahi prakriyaayein apana kaam kar sakati hai
 The subsurface activity of lava also plays a role in geomorphology
 sataha ke neeche chalata pighalaav jamini sataha kii sfiti or avasfiti kaa kaaran bana saktaa he or tibet ke neeche aanshik rup se pighali hui bhupatal parat ko hazaron kilometre par faile tibeti pathaar kii bhu-akruti ko niyantrit karne kaa yogadan diya gaya he
 The interaction of organisms with geomorphology or bio-geomorphic processes can occur in many forms and is probably quite important overall for terrestrial geomorphic systems
 jeev vigyaan, kai bhu-akritik prakriyaaon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, jiskaa kshetra rasinic apkshay ko niyantrit karne vaali jaev bhu-rasinic prakriyaaon se lekar yantric prakriyaaon ke prabhaav tak he jaise mrudaa vikaas par khudaai or tree thro or yahaan tak ki vaishvik apradan dar ko carbon dioxide santulan ke madhyam se jalwaayu kaa aaparivartan karte hue niyantrit karnaa bhi isamen shaamil he
 Terrestrial landscapes that can certainly exclude the role of biology in mediating surface processes are extremely rare, but they can provide important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets such as Mars Huh
 alag-alag sthanik or loukik paimaanon par alag-alag bhu-akritik prakriyaaon kaa prabhutv hota he
 In addition, the scales at which processes occur may dictate reactions or other forms of landscape changes to the motivating hair, such as climate or tectonics
 ye vichaar, aaj bhu-akruti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 Physiologists can use the following classifications to classify landscape measurements: o3m yaa onkaar kaa namaatar pranav he
 It is a sign of God
 ishwar ke saath onkaar kaa vachya-vaachak-bhav sambandh nity he, sankethik nahin
 The sign indicates a regular or natural relationship
 sristi ke aadi main sarvapratham onkarrupi pranav kaa hi sphuran hota he
 Subsequently seven crore mantras emerge
 in mantron ke vachya aatma ke devtaa rup main prasiddh hai
 These gods control the Mystic world by remaining on Maya
 in main se aadhe shuddh mayajgat main kaary karte hai or shesh aadhe ashuddh yaa malin mayik jagat main
 This one word is considered the essence of the universe, its glory is described in 16 verses
 brahmaprapti ke liye nirdisht vibhinn sadhano main pranavopasana mukhya he
 It is written in Mundakopanishad: kathopanishad main yah bhi likhaa he ki aatma ko adhar arani or onkaar ko uttar arani banaakar manthan rup abhyaas karne se divya gyaanarup jyoti kaa aavirbhaav hota he
 In the light of it, there is an interview of self-realization
 shrimadbhagavadgita main bhi onkaar ko ekakshar brahm kaha he
 In Mandukyopanishat, it is said that past, future or present and future-trikala-onkarta 
 yahan trikaal se ateet tatv bhi onkaar hi kaha gaya he
 The soul is Omkar in terms of alphabets and in terms of quantity it is form A, u and M
 chaturth paad main maatra nahin he evam vah vyavhaar se ateet tathaa prapanchashunya advait he
 This means that both the oncological word Brahman and the past Brahman are integral to it
 vaidic vaaiumay ke sadrush dharamshastra, puraana tathaa aagam sahitya main bhi onkaar kii mahima sarvatra pai jaati he
 Similarly, expression of reverence for Omkar is seen everywhere in Buddhist and Jain sects
 pranav shabd kaa arth he– prakarshennuyate stuyate anen iti, nauti stauti iti vaa pranav:
 To understand Pranav, his analysis is necessary
 yahan prasiddh aagmon kii prakriya ke anusaar vishleshan kriya kaa kuch digdarshan karaayaa jaataa he
 The ingredients of Omkaara are A, U, M, Bindu, Ardchandra Rodhini, Nad, Nadanta, Shakti, Vyapini or Mahashunya, Samana and Amina
 inamen se akar, ukaar or makaar ye teen sristi, sthiti or sanhaar ke sapadak brahma, vishnu tathaa rudra ke vaachak hai
 In turn, they are also capable of awakening, dreaming and sleeping and gross, subtle and causal states
 bindu turiya dasha kaa dyotak he
 The position of pluton and long volumes are gradually shortened and finally become absorbed in one volume
 yah hrasv swar kaa uccharan kaal mana jaataa he
 The entire world is reputed on this one volume

 In order to move from concentration to detention, this m quantity is also separated and entered in half-way
 taduparant kramash: sookshm or sookshmatar matraaon kaa bhed karnaa padataa he
 The point is half-way

 iskaa taatpary yah he ki a, u or m pranav ke in teen avyavon kaa atikaraman karne par arthtatv kaa avashya hi bhed ho jaataa he

 On the idol, the infinite power of immersion is also sacrificed and the businessman is also abandoned on it

 The celestial ropeway is a unique means of transporting material to a fixed place by crossing high, mountainous or turbulent lands
 kaarkaanon tathaa banate hue baandhon main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par kaccha saamaan le jane ke liye inkaa bahut upyog hota he
 There are two types of ropeway: single cord and double strand
 ekal rajju main ek hi achor rajju hoti he jo anwarat chalati rahati he
 It carries empty or filled docks to its destination
 e dol rajju main apane vaahak ke saath bandhe rahete hai
 a steel skeleton or attachable rests on the rope, with the dole tied to the saddle with its carrier
 rajju nirantar chalati rahati he or apane saath dolon ko bhi liye chalati he
 There are rotating rings on both ends of the ropeway, on which the rope is mounted
 chitra kha main ladane kaa sthaan dikhaaya gaya he
 At each end, there is a sticking track, on which the dole is loaded to load or empty
 kaam puraa ho jane par dol ko phir rajju par thel diya jaataa he
 In the case of the derailment track and rope, there is such arrangement that it is very easy to send the dole from one to the other and the Ranch does not even blow on the rope; This is very important for the rope to be durable
 yadi rajjumarg adhik lanbaa hota he to prayek teen yaa chaar mile par vibhaajak stesan bana diya jaataa he, jahaan dol pehali rajjupranali ko chhod dete hai or unke pahie sthir patariyon par chadh jate hai
 Then they are pushed forward to climb the rope of the second part
 yadi rajjumarg main dishaaparivartan kii aavashyaktaa padati he to parivartan ke sthaan par ek platfarm bana diya jaataa he jisamen do kshaitij ghiraniyaan rahati hai
 The rope passes through these pulleys and easily changes its direction
 rajju ispaat ke taron ko batakar bani rahati he
 In his election, it is necessary to keep the following things in mind: ek-ek dol main kitna boj ladengaa
 How much time will be available to load and unload rajjumarg kaa veg kitna rahegaa
 By considering these things, the functionality of the ropeway is fixed, that is, it is fixed how much burden will be incurred per hour
 praaia: boj ladane kaa samay bees se tees second tak hi hota he
 One or more drops can be filled together as required
 rajju kaa veg rajjumarg kii dhaal par bhi nirbhar rahata he
 Its speed is generally kept at two to five miles per hour, but it can also be done up to seven miles per hour
 parantu samaran rakhana chahie ki gati main jitani tivrata hogi utani hi adhik isamen parivartan ke jatke lagane kii bhi sambhaavna rahegi
 Therefore, it is advisable to use only two-way system for more distance and more capacity
 is prakaar rajju kii motaai kramagat attalkon ke bich kii duuri, unke bich kii rajju par ek saath honevaale adhiktam boj kii maatra or prati inch motaai ke anusaar rajju kii majbootee par nirbhar he
 Ropes range in thickness from 1⁄2 inch 'to 11⁄2 inch in thickness
 rajju pehle itani hi tani jaati he ki vitasti ke centre par uski nati adhik se adhik vitasti kii 1 / 20 ho
 Therefore, the final form of the ropeway is determined only after taking into account the immovable burden, the pressure of the air, the effect of shaking and vibrations, etc
 achal bhaar, daab aadi ko kul bhaar kaa 25 pratishat maan liya ja saktaa he
 The engine is required to operate the rope at a predetermined speed and its power depends on the rope's shield
 kabhi-kabhi maal ladane kaa stesan utaaranevaale stesan kii apeksha itani adhik oonchaai par hota he ki gurutvkarshan ke kaaran laden hue dol na keval swayan neeche utarate hai, varan unase utpann phaltu shakti anya kaaryon main bhi sahaayak ho sakati he
 It can be said for a simple estimate that up to four to five horsepower may be required due to friction at loading and unloading stations
 attalikon par or rajju par ke gharshan ke liye sa ́l / 12 ashwasamarthy chahie, jahaan sa prati ghanta prati ton main rajjumarg kii kshamta he or l maarg kii lambaai milon main he
 There is also a loss of some power in the conducting cycles, which can be around 25 percent of the aforesaid friction
 attalikaon ke nirmaan main inaki kramik duuri ke saath anya baton kaa dhyaan rakhna padataa he, jaise The dual rope system has a guide cord, which carries the burden of the drovers and does not let them deviate from the right path
 duusari rajju chalati rahati he or vahi dolon ko ghaseet le chalati he, jaisaa chitra ng main dikhaaya gaya he
 The dragging cord is of the same type as in the single-rope-system
 in donon pranaaliyon main koun si pranali chunani chahie, yah bataanaa bahut kathin he
 In the twilight system, initially more expense is incurred, but this system is more suitable for traffic of greater distance and more burden on more slope
 ekal-rajju-pranali adhik saral he or halke tathaa asthaayee kaamon ke liye avashya hi apekshaakrit sasti he
 In the hilly regions, a maximum of three percent slope can be laid on the railways, but the ropeway can work up to 40 percent slope
 yadi kisi parvatiy pradesh main do binduon ke talon kaa antar 2,640 foot he or ve ek duusare se do mile par hai to do mile ke hi rajjumarg se kaam chal jayega; parantu 2 pratishat kii dhaal ke railmarg kii lambaai 20 mile rakhni padegi
 Again, the difficulties of crossing the rugged ravines of railways and building bridges, embankments and ancestors from place to place may also be excessive

 The Gryphian follicle explodes shortly after the end of the animal, and another structure called the corpus luteum begins to develop at this location
 korampas lutium se ek anya hormone jise projesteron kehete hai joki garbhashay ko bhrun ke vikaas ke liye taiyaar karata hai tathaa ye pashu ko garmeen main aane se bhi rikt hai
 Therefore, there is an urgent need for successful pregnancy after conception of the corpus luteum
