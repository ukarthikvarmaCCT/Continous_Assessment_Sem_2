 Renaming Fidel Castro's gang as a July 26 movement, the Batista government pardoned him in May 1955 because the government did not face any political challenge from Fidel

 However, the conventional war strategy by his army did not compete with Castro's raiding policies, and eventually MR 26-7 advanced from the Sierra Maestra to capture the majority of the Orient and Las Viès

 When revolutionary forces seized most of Cuba, Castro issued orders for the arrest of Kantio, while a short-lived government was formed by making Manuel Urrutia Lyão the president and José Miró Kardona as prime minister to create laws that weakened the Batista group
 Go march 1952 main cubai faujee general fulgensio batista ne satta ko apane qabze main le liya, jiske kaaran chunaavon se bane raashtrapati karlos prio sokarras ko mexico bhaagna padaa
 While declaring himself president, Batista decided to plan presidential elections and called his new system a "discipline-bound democracy"

 Batista went to the right and deepened relations with the capitalists and the US, while breaking diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and suppressed the labor unions and filed cases against Cuban socialist groups

 When Castro's case began to show impunity, he began to look at other options to oust the new government

 jab kastro aandolan ke mukhya bane, sanghathan gairqanoonee ikai pranali par aadhaarit tha, jisamen har ikai ke das sadsy the
 The main focus of the movement was a dozen members who were dissatisfied with the Ortodoxo, however from July 1952 these people started recruiting on a large scale, which included 1,200 members within a year, a hundred units were formed, most of which were the poor of Havana Were from districts kastro ke krantikari samaajwaad se gahare sambandh hone ke baavjood usne communist pi es pi se judane se khud ko dur rakhaa kyonki isse dar tha ki rajnatik narampanthi dar jaayenge, haalaanki vyaktigat rup se usne kai pi es pi sadasyon se sampark banaae rakhaa, jisamen uske bhai raul kastro bhi rahe
 In later times Castro stated that the members of the movement were merely anti-batista and that hardly any of them held strong socialist or anti-imperialist views, which, according to Castro, were "a profound influence of New York ideology and the advertising system"
 For this reason, the class consciousness of the Cuban working class was being suppressed

 Castro's plan was an imitation of 19th-century Cuban freedom fighters who raided Spain's barracks; Castro began to see himself as the leader of independence and successor to the national hero José Marati
 kastro ne 165 krantikariyon ko is mishan ke liye jamaa kiya; 138 santiyago main or anya 27 bayamo main
 Regarding several young men from Havana and Pinar del Río, Castro decided that no one should have children except himself, and he refused to let the army shed blood in any situation other than the encounter

 The Quran, the Quran or Koran is the holiest book of Islam and its foundation

 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today
 musalamaanon ke anusaar kuran main die gaye gyaan se ye sabit hota he ki hazarat mohammad ek islamic pigambar nabi he | The first mention of the word "qur'an" is found in the Qur'an itself where it means - he read, or he read
 yah shabd iske syrian samanaantar courienna kaa arth letaa he jiskaa arth hota he granthon ko padhanaa
 Although Westernists associate it with the Syrian word, most Muslims believe that its root is the word Qur'a
 par chaahe jo hazarat mohammad ke janmdin ke samay hi yah ek arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 The word has been mentioned some 70 times in the Qur'an itself
 iske alaave bhi koran ke kai naam hai
 It has also been addressed by names such as Al Furaqan, Al Hikmah, Dhikr / Zikr and Mashhaf
 koran main allaah ne 25 ambia kaa zikr kiya he
 The word Quran appears about 70 times in the Quran, which assumes different meanings
 yah arabi kriya qara kaa ek maukhik sangya he, jiskaa arth he "vah padhata he"
 Syriac is the equivalent qarayana, which refers to "reading scripture" or "lesson"
 jabaki kuch pashchimi vidwaan is shabd ko siriek se praapt karne par vichaar karte hai, muslim adhikariyon ke bahumat main shabd kii utpatti qara hi hoti he
 Regardless, it had become an Arabic word during Muhammad's lifetime
 shabd kaa ek mahatvapurn arth "paath kaa kaary" he, jaisaa ki praarambhik kurani maarg main darshaya gaya he: "yah hamaare liye ise ikattha karnaa or ise padhanaa he 
 In other verses, the term refers to "a personal passage"
 iskaa kai sandarbh main kai prakaar se adab kiya jaataa he
 As an example: "when al-quran is recited, listen to it and be silent
 " anya dharmon ke granth jaise torah or susamachar ke saath varnit arth bhi grahan kar saktaa he
 The word also has synonyms which are employed throughout the Quran
 prayek samanaarthi kaa apana alag arth hota he, lekin iskaa upyog kuch sandarbhon main quran ke saath mil saktaa he
 In such words the book, Ayah; And sura
 baad ke do shabd bhi prakaashan kii ikaayiyon ko darshaate hai
 In the large majority of references, usually with a definite article, the term is referred to as "publication", which has been "sent" at intervals
 anya sambandhit shabd hai: dhikkaar, quran ko ek anusmarak or chetavanee ke arth main sanderbhit karata he, or hikmah, kabhi-kabhi prakaashan yaa iske hisse kaa zikr karata he
 The Quran describes itself as "prudence", "mother of texts", "guide", "wisdom", "remembrance"
 or "rahasyodghatan" 
 Another word is al-kitab, although it is also used in Arabic for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible
 musahaf shabd kaa prayog aksar vishesh kuranik lipiyon ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he lekin quran main bhi pehle kii kitabon kii pahchaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation during his prayer in the cave of Hira on the mountains
 iske baad, unhen 23 varshon kii avadhi main puraa koran kaa khulaasa praapt hua
 According to the hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad came to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to read the Quran and learn and teach the laws, which were told daily
 yah sambandhit he ki kuch kurash jinhen badr kii ladaai main kaidiyon ke rup main le jaaya gaya tha, unhone kuch musalamaanon ko us samay ke saral lekhan ko sikhaye jane ke baad apni aazaadee hasil kar lee
 Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate
 jaisaa ki shuru main kaha gaya tha, quran ko takhton, khaalon, haddiyon, or ke tane ke chaude lakadiyon par darj kiya gaya tha
 Most suras were in use among Muslims as they have been mentioned in many hadiths and histories by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating to Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, as a way of praying and reading
 haalanki, quran 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke samay pustak rup main maujuud nahin tha
 There is an agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write the revelation
 sahih al-bukaari haddees main mohammad ko rahasyodghatan kaa varnan karte hue bataaya, "kabhi-kabhi yah ghanti bajane kii tarah " or aaisha ne bataaya, "maine dekha ki paigambar bahut hi thande din main vahi se prerit ho rahe hai or unke maathe se pasinaa nikal rahaa tha
 As soon as the inspiration of the same was over, his restlessness would go away
 " quran ke anusaar mohammad kaa pehla prakaashan, ek drushti ke saath tha
 The medium of revelation is described as "a powerful one", a person who was "on the topmost horizon when clear to see
 phir vah nikat aa gaya or mohammad se baat karne laga
 "islamic study scholars state in the Welch encyclopedia that they believe that Muhammad's condition and descriptions at these moments can be considered real, as he was severely disturbed after these revelations
 velch ke mutabik, mohammad kii preranaon kii atimanvi utpatti ke liye unke aas-paas ke logon ne in daure ko dekha hoga
 However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a person, a poet, or a magician because his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures in ancient Arabia
 velch atirikt rup se bataata he ki yah anishchit he ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke praarambhik daawey se pehle yaa baad main ye anubhav hue the
 The Quran describes Muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "uneducated", but its meaning is more complex
 madhyakaalin tippaneekaron jaise al-tabari ne kaha ki is shabd ne do arthon ko prerit kiya: pehla, saamaanya rup se padhane yaa likhane main asamarthta; doosraa, pichhali kitabon yaa granthon kii anubhavheenata yaa agyanta 
 Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as an indication of the reality of his prophecy
 udhaaharan ke liye, fakhruddin al-raji ke anusaar, yadi mohammad ne lekhan or padhai main maharath hasil kii thi to sambhawatah unhen purvajon kii kitabon kaa adhyayan karne kaa andeh hota
 Some scholars, like Watt, prefer the second meaning of "ummi" - they first take it to indicate unfamiliarity with sacred texts
 quran kii antim aayat varsh 10veen hijri main dhu al-hijjah ke islamic maheene ke 18 veen tarikh ko prakat hui thi, jo ek taarikh he jo mote taur par farvari yaa march 632 se mail khaati he 
 This was revealed after the Prophet gave his sermon in Ghadir e Khumm
 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, unke kai saathi jo quran ko kanthst jaanate the, musalimaa dwaara yamama kii ladaai main maare gaye the
 The first Khalifa, Abu Bakr, later decided to gather the book into a book to preserve it
 zayd ebn thabit quran ko ikattha karne vaale pehle vyakti the kyonki vah allaah ke nabi mohammad se padhe gaye aaayaaton or suron ko likhaa karte the
 Thus, the most important of the classical group, Zaid bin Thabit, collected verses and compiled the entire book to give the Qur'an the form of a book
 is tarah quran ek granth ke rup main aagai or uski prati abu bakr ke saath hi rahi
 For this work, Zaid has cropped all the pages which were written on the bone, on the leaves, on the stones and many people had memorized them
 abu bakar ke baad, mohammad kii vidhwaa hafasa bint umr ko lagbhag 650 main is pandulipi ko saunpa gaya tha
 The third Caliph Uthman ibn Afan began to notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Quran as Islam spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa
 paath kii pavitrataa ko sangrakshit karne ke liye, unhone jayad kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa aadesh diya taaki abu bakar kii pratilipi kaa upyog kiya ja sake or quran kii ek maanak prati taiyaar kii ja sake
 Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed in written form
 yah paath us model ban gaya jahaan se muslim duniya ke shahari kendron main pratiyaan banaai gayi or prakshepit kii gayi, or anya sanskarnon ko nasht kar diya gaya mana jaataa he
 The current form of Quran recitation is considered by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr
 shiya ke anusaar, ali ebn abi talib ne mohammad kii mrityu ke turant baad quran kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The sequence of this text was gathered later during Uthman's era that this version was collected in chronological order
 iske baavjood, unhone manakikrut quran ke khilaaf koi aapatti nahin kii or quran ko parisancharan main sweekaar kar liya
 Other individual copies of the Quran may exist, including the codecs of Ibn Mas'ud and Ube ibn Ka'b, none of which exist today
 quran mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bikhri hui likhit rup main sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Several sources indicate that a large number of his companions had missed the revelation during Muhammad's lifetime
 praarambhik tippaniyan or islamic aitihaasik strot quran ke shuruaati vikaas kii uparyukt samaj kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Quran in its current form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad as the discovery of variants has not given much importance
 chicago vishvavidhyalay ke professor fred donor ne kaha ki "

 Ismail al-faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any revival of Muslim civilization must begin with the Quran; However, the biggest obstacle on this passage is the centuries-old legacy of "tafsir and other classical disciplines that prevent the" universal, epistemological, and systematic conception "of the Quranic message

 In native Arabic, the surya and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that aid the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text
 muslim jor den ki quran kii saamagree or style anuchit he
 The language of the Quran is described as "poetry prose" because it is part of both poetry and prose; However, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of the Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others
 quran, jabaki puure quran main paaya gaya tha, pehle ke kai makka suras main vishisht he, jisamen apekshaakrit kam chand gayan ke shabdon ko pramukhataa main phenk dete hai

 Self-referentiality is evident in those paragraphs where the Quran refers to itself as revealing itself in a self-sufficient way, as news, as a norm

 Main article: Tafsir quran ne quran ke chhandon ke arthon ko samajhane, unke aayaat ko spasht karne or unke mahatv ko jaanane ke uddeshy se tippanee or vyakhya kaa ek vishaal nikaay udaaya he
 Tafsir is one of the earliest educational activities of Muslims
 quran ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jisane praarambhik musalamaanon ke liye chhandon ke arthon kaa varnan kiya tha
 Other early bodies included some of Muhammad's companions, such as 'ali ibn Abi Talib,' Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kab

 The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, titled Tafsir e Kabir
 gudh vyakhya yaa sufi vyakhya quran ke aantarik arthon kaa anaavaran karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Sufism transcends the explicit point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric and spiritual dimensions of consciousness and existence
 sands ke anusaar, gudh vyakhyaayein ghoshnaatmak se adhik suchak hai, ve spashtikaran ke bajaay sanket hai
 They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each author

 Muhammad Husayn Tababatei states that according to popular explanations among later passages, tawil means that a verse has been instructed
 tawal ke virodh main, prakaashan kaa arth, shabdon ke spasht arth ke anusaar spasht he, jaisaa ki unhen bataaya gaya tha
 But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of tawil, which originally meant "to return" or "return place"
 tabatai ke vichaar main, jise taivil yaa quran kii harmenutic vyakhya kaha jaataa he, ko shabdon ke sanket ke saath chintit nahin he
 Rather, it deals with some truths and realities that are beyond the comprehension of the common part of men; Yet it is from these truths and realities that the doctrine of doctrine and the practical prohibition of the Quran continue
 vyakhya kavita kaa arth nahin he balki yah us arth ke madhyam se pargaman ke ek vishesh prakaar main paardarshee he
 There is a spiritual reality — which is the main purpose of obeying a law, or the basic purpose of describing a divine attribute — and then there is a real significance that a Quranic story refers to
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar, jo mohammad or imam jaise gyaan main dridhtaa se nihit hai, quran ke rahasyon ko jaanate hai
 According to Tabatai, the statement "no one knows its interpretation except God" remains valid without any adversary or qualification clause
 isliye, jahaan tak is kavita kaa sawaal he, quran kii vyakhya kaa gyaan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit he
 But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know to some extent the interpretation of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, sweekaarya or asweekaarya gudh vyakhyaayein hai
 Acceptable ta'wil refers to the meaning of a poem beyond its literal meaning; Rather the underlying meaning, which is ultimately known only to God and cannot be directly understood through human thought alone
 prashn main chand yahaan aane, jane, baithne, santushti, krodh or dukh ke maanviya gunon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jinhen spasht rup se bhagwaan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he 
 The unacceptable ta'wil is one where the apparent meaning of a poem "transfers" to a different meaning through a proof; This method is not without obvious discrepancies
 yadhyapi yah asweekaarya ta'vil ne kaaphi sweekruti praapt kii he, yah galat he or kuranik chhandon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The correct interpretation is that reality refers to a poem
 yah sabhi chhandon main paaya jaataa he, nirnaayak or aspasht ek jaise; yah shabd kaa arth nahin he; yah ek tathy he ki shabdon ke liye bahut shandaar he
 God has prepared them with words to bring a little to their minds; In this respect they are like stories that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the listener to clearly understand the intended idea

 His style or repetition is ad hoc and non-systematic and geared towards apologizing

 Baghdad, a 10th-century Muslim scholar from Ibn Mujahid, is famous for establishing seven acceptable recitations of the Quran
 unhone vibhinn qaraat or unki bharosemandata kaa adhyayan kiya or makka, madina, kufa, basra or damishq ke shaharon se saat 8 veen shatabdi ke qareeyon ko chunaa
 Ibn Mujahid did not explain why he chose seven readers instead of six or ten, but it may be related to a prophetic tradition that the Quran was revealed in the seven "arufs"
 aaj, sabase lokapriy kaari haafiz or warsh dwaara preshit hai jo ebn mujahid ke do pathakon, aasim ebn abi al-najud or naphi al ke anusaar hai -madani kramshah

 Before printing was widely adopted in the 19th century, the Quran was circulated in manuscripts made by calligraphers and defendants

 Quranic statements on the creation of the universe and the earth, origins of human life, biology, earth science and so on have been criticized by developing theories such as foreclosure, unscientific, and scientific theories that are likely to be contradicted

 The language of the Quran was similar to the Syriac language
 quran yahudee or isai pavitra kitabon or bhakthi sahitya main sunai gai kai logon or ghatnaon kii kahaniyon ko yaad karata he, haalanki yah kai vivaranon main bhinn he
 Adam, Idris, Noah, Eber, Saleh, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Shoaib, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Yunus, Aaron, Moses, Zacharias, John Jesus, mention of Rasool in the Quran And has been performed as a prophet

 One scholar has suggested that diatesiron as a gospel harmony may have given rise to the notion that the Christian gospel is a text
 quran ke avataran ke baad, or islam ke saamaanya udai, arabi varnmaala teji se ek kala rup main viksit hua
 According to Wadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago, and Mustassir Mir, Professor of Islamic Studies at Youngstown State University: mukhya kshetron jisamen quran ne arabi sahitya par dhyaan dene yogya prabhaav daalaa, ve dictionari or theme hai; anya kshetra quran ke saahitiyik pahaluon se vishesh rup se shapath, roopak, ruparekha or pratikon se sambandhit hai
 As far as the novel is concerned, one can say that Quranic words, idioms and expressions, especially "weighted" and formulaic phrases, appear in practically all genres of literature and in such abundance That it is impossible to compile his complete record
 quran ne na keval apane sandesh ko vyakt karne ke liye ek puri tarah se nai bhashaai corpus banaaya he, balki yah puraane arthon ke saath puraani, purv islamic shabdon ko bhi sampann karata he or yah un arthon se he jo bhashaa main or baad main sahitya main jaden lete hai 


 Allah has sent man to this earth as his caliph
 bhejne se purv usne har vyakti ko thik thik samajha diya tha ki ve thode samay ke liye dharti par ja rahe hai, uske baad unhen uske paas laut kar aana he
 Where he will get good or bad revenge for his actions which he did on earth
 Man has freedom to work on this earth
 dharti ke sadhano ko upyog karne kii chhot he
 There is no restriction or reward on doing good and bad work
 kintu is swatantraaa ke saath ishwar ne dharti par based manushyon ko thik us rup main jivan guzaarane ke liye ishwariya adeshon ke pahunchane kaa prabandh kiya or dharti ke har bhaag main usne apane doot bheje, jinhone manushyon tak ishwar kaa sandesh bheja
 The number of such messengers is said to be around 1,84,000
 is silsile kii antim kadi hazarat mohammad the
 No messenger will come after you, but Hazrat Jesus will spend the rest of his life on this earth again
 ishwar kii antim kitaab aapke haath main he koi or ishwariya kitaab ab nahin aegi
 His message was one, his mission was one, to teach human beings to live according to the divine command, for thousands of years of constant prophets, whether they had descended into any part of the earth
 hazaron varshon kaa samay bitne ke kaaran ishwariya adeshon main manushya apane vichaar, apni suvidha jod kar nayaa dharm bana lete or mul dharm ko vikrut kar ek aadambar khadaa kar dete or kai baar to ishwariya adeshon ke viparit kaary karte
 Because every effective person wanted to see everyone bow down before his power
 akhir antim nabi hazarat mohammad koran ke saath is dharti par aae or koran ishwar ke is chalange ke saath aayaa ki isaki raksha swayan ishwar karegaa
 a long time of 1500 years suggests that even after all the efforts of the Quranic opponents, not a single word of the Quran has been changed
 yah kitaab apane mul swaroop main pralay tak rahegi
 Along with this, the challenge of the Quran is still in place that those who do not consider it to be a divine book, they should show a complete book like this and not just a small part of it
 koran ke is rup ko jaanane ke baad yah jaan lijie ki yah kitaab rup main hazarat mohammad ko nahin di gai ki ise padhakar logon ko suna den or chhap kar har ghar main rakh den
 Rather, from time to time for 23 years, this book has emerged as per requirement and you have made the society on earth according to his orders at the will of God, as God had ordered

 vaigyanik tathy jo ab tak hamen gyaat hai, koran main chupe hai or aise saikadon sthaan he jahaan lagata he ki manushya gyaan abhi us haqiqat tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Again and again the Quran gives you a feast to ponder
 zamin or aasmaan ke rahasyon ko jaanane kaa aamantran detaa hai
 a confusion ensues
 kuran ke daawey ke anusaar vah puri dharti ke manushyon ke liye or shesh samay ke liye he, kintu uske sambodhit us samay ke arab nazar aate hai
 It seems cursory that the Qur'an was only for the Arabs of that time, but whenever you reach a place when it seems that this thing is only for a particular time and country, then stop there
 Think or note it and consider it later, you will feel that every time a human being is one of every age and every terrain, and the same thing applies to them as the people of that time
 Used to apply to Arabs
 musalamaanon ke liye koran ke sambandh main badi badi kitaaben likhi gai hai or likhi ja sakati hai
 The purpose here is to give a brief introduction of the Qur'an and clarify what is right on its Ummah
 hazarat ali se rivaayat kii gai ek haddees he
 Hazrat Haris states that when i entered the mosque, i saw some people quarreling in some problems
 main hazarat ali ke paas gaya or unhen is baat kii soochna di
 Hazrat Ali ordered - Did these things happen? i said yes
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- yaad rakho maine rasul allaah se suna he
 You ordered - Beware, a big head will be raised near me, i have requested - what will be the means of getting rid of this situation? The Book of Allah
 koran kaa sara nichod is ek haddees main aa jaataa he
 The last book of Allah on the Qur'an is in line with his fame
 yah atyant aasaan he or yah bahut kathin bhi he
 Easy when it is read to remember
 yadi aap kii niyat main khot nahin he or koran se hidaayat chaahate hai to allaah ne is kitaab ko aasaan bana diya he
 This is the easiest book in the world to understand and remember
 khud koran me he 'or hamane koran ko samajhane ke liye aasaan kar diya he, to koi he ki soche or samajhe?' On the other hand, from the point of view of telescopes, it is the world's hardest book, even after spending entire life it is not possible to measure its depth
 is drushti se dekha jaae to yah ek samudr he
 Houses have passed and the miracle of the Quran still prevails
 or sadiyaan biit jaaengi kintu koran kaa chamatkaar kabhi samaapt nahin hoga
 The only easy way to get instruction is to pay attention to the persistent verses and believe in the verses that this too is from Allah
 duniya nirantar pragati kar rahi he, maanav gyaan nirantar bad rahaa he, jo koran main kal mutshabihaat tha aaj vah spasht ho chukaa he, or kal uske kuch ore bhaag spasht honge
 Similarly, two different methods have to be adopted for learning
 adeshon ke lihaaz se koran main vichaar karne vaale ko peeche kii ore yatra kerani hogi
 The meaning of the Qur'an's order was seen by theologians, scholars (tabatabai, Tabai'in)
 ) or sahaba ne iskaa kya arth liya
 Even to give himself to the steps of Hazrat Muhammad, what was the order of the Quran itself? duusari ore gyanvigyaan ke lihaaz se aage or nirantar aage vichaar karnaa hoga
 Go beyond it not just with time
 manushya ke gyaan kii sataha nirantar oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 The Quran has the highest level of science, considering that new inventions, discoveries and scientific facts can be worked on
 muajaza us chamatkaar ko kehete hai jo kisi nabi yaa rasul ke haath par ho or maanav shakti se pare ho, jis par maanav budhdi hairaan ho jaae
 In the same way, there are many more
 har yug main jab bhi koi rasul ishwariya adeshon ko maanav tak pahunchataa, tab use allaah kii ore se chamatkaar die jate the
 Hazrat Musa was granted as many miracles
 hazarat isa ko murdon ko jivit karnaa, bimaaron ko thik karne kaa muajaza diya gaya
 The real opportunity of any prophet is that which he presents with a claim
 hazarat mohammad ke haath par saikadon maajaze varnit hai, kintu jo daawey ke saath pesh kiya gaya or jo aaj bhi chamatkaar ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh maujuud he, vah he koran jiskaa yah chelenz duniya ke samaksh anuttarit he ki iske ek bhaag jaisaa hi bana kar dikhaa diya jaae
 This claim was made at many places in the Quran
 The Qur'an will be completely safe, the claim has passed 1500 years and the Qur'an is safe, completely safe
 yah siddh ho chukaa he, jo ek chamatkaar he
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran vigyaan kii kasuti par khara utraa he, or uske vaigyanik varnanon ke aage vaigyanik natmastak hai
 This is also a miracle
 1500 varsh purv arab ke registan main ek anpadh vyakti ne aisi kitaab prastut kii jo beesvin sadi ke saare sadhano ke saamne apni satyata zaahir kar rahi he
 If any other book has done this work other than the Quran, the world would like to know its name
 koran kaa yah chamatkaarik rup aaj hamaare liye he or ho saktaa he aage aane vaale samay ke liye uskaa koi or chamatkaarik rup saamne aae
 When the Quran was incarnated, its main miracle in that era was not its scientific basis
 us yug main koran kaa chamatkaar tha uski bhashaa, sahitya, vagmita, jisane apane samay ke arabon ke bhashaa gyaan ko jhakzor diya tha
 It would be appropriate to clarify here that the Arabs of that time were so proud of their language knowledge that they called the people of the rest of the world Ajami
 koran kii style ke kaaran arab ke bhashaa gyaniyon ne apane ghutane tech die
 The Quran is a book based on which a revolution was brought
 registan ke aise anpadh logon ko jinka vishwa ke nakshe main us samay koi mahatv nahin tha
 Due to the teachings of the Quran, the training of his presenter brought him to the great powers of that time and a Quranic society was created in just 23 years which the world can never answer
 aaj bhi duniya maanati he ki koran or hazarat mohammad ne ek adarsh samaaj kii rachana kii
 From this point of view, if you study the Qur'an, then you have to walk with it
 uski shiksha par amal karen
 Not only in private life but in social, political and legal areas, then all those characters mentioned in the Quran will be seen alive
 ve sari kathinaayee or ve sari pareshaani saamne ajaaengi
 If the gang rises for this work with body, mind, money, then the instruction of the Quran will guide it at every turn
 koran allaah kii rassi he
 There is a hadith described by Hazrat Zaid bin Araqam in the Tirmizi which states that the Qur'an is the rope of Allah which stretches from the ground to the Assaman
 yah shabd huzur ke he jinhe hazarat zayd ne varnit kiya he
 In the same way, there are many more
 tabraani main varnit ek or haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek din huzur masjid main tasharif laae to dekha kuch log ek kone main baithe koran pard rahe hai or ek duusare ko samajha rahe hai
 Seeing this, a wave of happiness ran over your face
 aap sahaba ke us gut ke paas pahunche or un se kaha- kya tum maanate ho ki allaah ke atirikt koi anya mabood nahin he, main allaah kaa rasul hun or koran allaah kii kitaab he? sahaba ne kaha, yaa rasul allaah ham gavaahi dete hai ki allaah ke atirikt koi mabood nahin, aap allaah ke rasul hai or koran allaah kii kitaab he
 Then you said, rejoice that the Quran is the rope of Allah with one end in his hand and the other in your hand
 The Qur'an is also the rope of Allah in the sense that it binds the Muslims together
 unamem vichaaron kii ekta, mat bhinnata ke samay allaah ke adeshon se nirnay or jivan ke liye ek adarsh namoona prastut karata he
 In the same way, there are many more
 khud koran main he ki allaah kii rassi ko majbuti se pakad lo
 There is no conflict between any faction of Muslims on the basis of the Quran
 koran kaa haq koran ke har musalmaan par paanch haq hai, jo use apni shakti or samarthy ke anusaar purna karnaa chahie
 To understand the Quran, it is important to know the background of its incarnation
 yah is tarah kii kitaab nahin he ki ise puraa likh kar pigambar ko dekar kah diya gaya ho ki jaao isaki ore logon ko bulaao
 Rather, on the occasion of the Quran, which was started by Arab Muhammad in Arabia, the Qur'an was descended according to necessity
 aarambh se jaise hi koran kaa kuch bhaag avatarit hota aap use likhva dete or yah bhi bataa dete ki yah kiske saath padhaa jayega
 In order of incarnation, scholars have divided the Quran into two parts
 ek makki bhaag, doosraa madani bhaag
 Initially, there were minor appearances in maize
 unki bhashaa shreshth, prabhavi or arabon kii pasand ke anusaar shreshth saahitiyik darje vaali thi
 His words used to fall in the heart
 uske daivie sangeet se kaan usko sunne main lag jate or uske daivie prakaash se log aakarshith ho jate yaa ghabara jate
 It described the laws of creation on which human wonder is still astonishing after centuries, but all examples were local for this
 unheen ke itihaas, unhi kaa maahaul
 This went on for five years
 iske baad makke kii rajnatik tathaa aarthik satta par qabze vaale logon ne apane liye is khatre ko bhaanp kaa zulm va jyaadati kaa vah tandav kiya ki musalamaanon kii jo thodi sankhya thi usamen bhi kai logon ko gharbaar chhod kar habsha janaa padaa
 The prophet himself had to be imprisoned with all the family members in a valley and eventually left Mecca and went to Medina
 musalamaanon par yah bada sakht samay tha or allaah ne is samay jo koran nazil kiya usamen talwaar kii kaat or baadh kii tezi thi
 Which shook the entire area
 musalamaanon ke liye tasalli or is kathin samay main kii jane vaali prarthanaaain hai jo is aath varsh ke koran kaa mukhya bhaag raheen
 It is clear from this violent episode that the influence of human creativity and emotions was in the composition of this book
 makki daur ke teraa varsh baad madeene main musalamaanon ko ek kendra praapt ho gaya
 Where all the believers gathered and the incarnation of the third round began
 yahan musalamaanon kaa do nae prakaar ke logon se parichay hua
 The first Jews who had been inhabited here for centuries and according to their religious faith were waiting for the last prophet
 kintu antim nabi ko unhone apane atirikt duusari qaom main dekha to utpaat machaa diya
 During this period in the Quran, strict comments were made in the Quran on the book Ahle
 isi yug main kutachariyon kaa ek gut musalamaanon main paidaa ho gaya jo musalmaan hone kaa naatak karte or virodhiyon se mili rahat It was here that the Muslims got the permission for the armed struggle and they had to constantly face the attacks of the Meccans
 duusari ore ek islamic rajya kii sthapana ke saath puure samaaj kii rachana ke liye ishwariya niyam avatarit hue
 War, peace, justice, social customs and food, God's command of all are characteristic of the Qur'an of this era
 jinke aadhaar par samaajik barabari kaa ek adarsh rajya allaah ke rasul ne khadaa kar diya
 On the basis of this, even today, the order of Hazrat Muhammad is considered to be the first among the world heroes
 unhone jivan ke har kshaitra main zabaani nirdesh nahin die, balki us par amal karke dikhaaya
 Due to this background, the same thing has to be repeated many times in the Quran
 akeshwarwad, dharmik aadesh, swarg, narak, sabar , dharm parayanata ke vishay hai jo baar baar dohraye gaye
 The Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years the pursuit of this civilization on the whole world cannot be rescued
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 a few years ago, a group of Arabs collected verses from the Qur'an relating to the scriptures and translated them into English, Prof
 Presented to Dr
 Keith Moore, Professor of Embryology and Head of the University of Toronto
 is samay vishwa main bhrun shaastra ke sarvocch gyaata maane jate hai
 They were asked to present their views on the verses related to embryology in the Quran
 unhone unka adhyayan karne ke pashchaat kaha ki bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main koran main varnan thik aadhunik khojon ke anuroop hai
 Regarding some verses, he said that he cannot call it wrong or right because he himself is unaware of it
 isamen sabase pehle nazil kii gai koran kii vah aayat bhi shaamil thi jiskaa anuwaad he
 Take the name of your family and study, who created it
 jisane insaan ko khun kii footki se banaaya
 In this, a word has been used in Arabic language, it has one meaning of blood foot and the other means like leech
 dow
 moore ko us samay tak yah gyaat nahin tha ki kya mata ke garbh main aarambh main bhrun kii surat jonk kii tarah hoti he
 He conducted his experiments on this and after study said that initially in the mother's womb, the fetus is in the shape of leech
 dow kith moore ne bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main 80 prashnon ke uttar die jo koran or haddees main varnit hai
 In the same way, there are many more
 unhi ke shabdon main, yadi 30 varsh purv mujhase yah prashn puche jate to main inamen aadhe bhi uttar nahin de paata
 Because till then science had not made so much progress in this area
 In 1981, at the Saudi Medical Conference, Dr
 Moore announced that he had come to believe that Hazrat Muhammad was a prophet of God by looking at the verses of the Qur'an's embryology
 kyon ki sadiyon purv jab vigyaan khud bhrun avasthaa main ho itani sateek baaten keval ishwar hi kah saktaa he
 Dr
 Moore has included everything in the 1982 edition of his book which is available in many languages and is taught to first-year medical students
 is kitaab ko kisi ek vyakti dwaara chikitsa shaastra ke kshaitra main likhi kitaab kaa award bhi mil chukaa he
 There are hundreds of examples that you will read continuously in this commentary of the Quran
 mat bhinnata ek etraz kiya jaataa he ki jab koran itani sidhd kitaab he to uski tikaa main hazarat mohammad se ab tak vidwaanon main mat bhinnata kyon he
 Suffice it to say here that Prophet Muhammad promoted healthy discrimination among his followers, but you did not like bigotry and factionalism on the basis of differences
 sehatmand matbhinnata samaaj kii pragati main sadaiv sahaayak hoti he or gutbandi sadaiv nuqasaan pahunchaati he
 Therefore, the differences of Islamic scholars have also helped to work in the Qur'an hadith and in the creation of an ideal society, but the damage has been caused by factionalism by developing this differences in a radical way
 shabdic vahya koran hazarat mohammad par avatarit hua vah ishwariya shabdon main tha
 It is literal, not as meaning
 yah baat isliye spashth karnaa padi ki isai shikshan sansthaaon main yah shiksha di jaati he ki vahya ishwariya shabdon main nahin hoti balki nabi ke hriday par uskaa arth aata he jo vah apane shabdon main varnit kar detaa he
 This belief is important for Christians because they could tell the truth about the changes they made in the Bible
 puraa isai or yahudi vishwa sadiyon se yah prayaas kar rahaa he ki kisi prakaar yah sidhd kar de ki koran hazarat mohammad ke shabd hai or unki rachana he
 Many books have been written about this and efforts have been made to prove it in many ways but none have been able to achieve this success so far

 Yashpal's name is prominent among the writers of modern Hindi literature
 ye ek saath hi krantikari evam lekhak donon roopon main jane jate he
 After Premchand, he is named among the well-known progressive storytellers of Hindi
 apane vidhyaarthee jivan se hi yashpal krantikari aandolan se jude, iske parinamswarup lambi faraari or jail main vyateet karnaa padaa
 After this, he made literature his life, the work which he had done through gun, now he started the work of public awareness through bulletin
 yashpal ko sahitya evam shiksha ke kshetra main bharat sarkaar dwaara san 1970 main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Yashpal was born in an ordinary Khatri family on 3 December 1903 in Ferozepur Cantonment, Punjab
 unki maan shrimati premdevi vahaan anathalay ke ek skool main adhyapika thim
 Yashpal's father Harilal was an ordinary businessman
 unka paitruk gaanv ranghad tha, jahaan kabhi unke purvaj hamirpur se aakar bas gaye the
 Father had a small shop and it was because of his business that people used to call him 'lala'
 bich-bich main ve ghode par saamaan ladakar pheri ke liye aas-paas ke gaanvon main bhi jate the
 He used to raise a small amount of money he had collected from his business, without any strong written and educated hand, borrowed on interest
 apane parivaar ke prati unka dhyaan nahin tha
 That is why Yashpal's mother, with her two sons - Yashpal and Dharmapala - was much more aware of her children's education while teaching in a school of Arya Samaj in Ferozepur Cantonment
 yashpal ke vikaas main garibi ke prati tikhi ghrinaa arya samaaj or swadhinata andolan ke prati upje aakarshan ke mul main unki maan or is parivesh kii ek nirnaayak bhoomika rahi he
 Poverty suffered in Yashpal's creative development had a distinctive role in his childhood
 apane bachapan main yashpal ne angrezon ke aatank or vicitra vyavhaar kii anek kahaniyaan suni thim
 No Indian could pass an umbrella in front of the British to avoid rain or sunlight
 bade shaharon or pahaado par mukhya sadaken unheen ke liye thim, hindustani in sadakon ke neeche bani kachi sadak par chalate the
 Yashpal heard these things only in his senses, not seen, because by then the sparks of the revolutionary movement, which had denied the sovereignty of the British, were bursting in place
 lekin phir bhi apane bachapan main yashpal ne jo bhi kuch dekha, vah angrezon ke prati ghrinaa bhar dene ko kaafii tha
 He writes, "I have seen the British taking salute from all the common people on the road
 hindustaniyon ko unke saamne gidgidaate dekha he, isse apana apmaan anumaan kiya he or uske prati virodh anubhav kiya
 

 ' angrezon or prakarantar se british samrajyavad ke viruddh apni ghrinaa ke sandarbh main yashpal apane bachapan kii do ghatnaon kaa ullekh vishesh rup se karte hai
 The first of these incidents is of four-five years of age
 tab unke ek sambandhi yuktpraant ke kisi qasbe main kapaas otane ke kaarakaane main manager the
 There were two to four bungalows of the British working near the factory station
 aas-paas hi in logon kaa khub aatank tha
 Chickens were raised in one of these bungalows, which roamed on the nearby road
 ek shaam yashpal un murgiyon se chhedhkhani karne lage
 Mem Sahiba, who lives in Bengali, reprimanded children for this act
 shaayad ‘gadhaa’ yaa ‘ullu’ jaisi koi gaali bhi di
 Yashpal, a child of four or five years, also responded to his abuses with abuse
 jab us stri ne unhen maarane kii dhamkee di, to unhone bhi use vaise hi dhamkaate hue jawaab diya or phir bhagkar kaarakaane main chhip gaye
 But the incident could not be taken lightly
 isaki shikaayat unke sambandhi se kii gai
 He complained to Yashpal's mother, and amidst many apprehension and terror, he also told about the crisis that could befall the people of the whole factory
 phir iske parinaam kaa ullekh karte hue yashpal likhte hai, ‘meri maan ne ek chadi lekar mujhe koob peeta main zamin par lot-pot gaya parantu pitayee jari rahi
 It is not difficult to imagine how my feelings towards the British must have arisen as a result of this incident
 


’ The second incident is a little later
 tab yashpal kii maan yuktpraant main hi nainital zile main tirai ke qasbe kashipur main arya kanya paathshaala main mukhyadhyapika thim
 Relatively far away from the city, the relative had got a lot of accommodation due to his work and Yashpal's mother also lived there
 ghar ke paas hi ‘dron sagar’ naamak ek talab tha
 The women of the house often went for a walk there in the afternoon
 ek din ve striyaan vahaan naha rahi thim ki uske duusari ore do angrez shaayad faujee gore, achaanak dikhaai die
 Seeing them, women started screaming in fear and clinging to each other in self-defense, in fear, they took off their clothes and started running away
 yashpal bhi unke saath bhaage
 Nothing special happened but the scene of running away from the British in such a manner was permanently stung in their memory
 

‘angrez se vah bhay aisa hi tha jaise bakriyon ke jhund ko baagh dekh lene se bhay lagata hoga arthath angrez kuch bhi kar saktaa tha
 There was no other way than to cry and scream with fear from him
 

’ The Arya Samaj and the Congress were the stops which Yashpal eventually came to the revolutionary organization
 unki maan unhen swami dayanand ke aadarshon kaa ek tejasvi prachaarak bananaa chaahati thim
 For this purpose, he got his initial education in Gurukul Kangri
 arya samaji daman ke viruddh ugr pratikriya ke beej unke man kii dharti par yaheen pade
 It was here that he got an opportunity to closely observe the revivalist tendencies
 apni nirdhantaa kaa kachot-bharaa anubhav bhi unhen yaheen hua
 Even in his childhood, he does not think of himself as responsible for the crime of being poor
 inhen sanskaron ke kaaran ve garib ke apmaan ke prati kabhi udasin nahin ho sake
 Congress was Yashpal's second stage
 apane daur ke anek duusare logon kii tarah ve bhi congress ke madhyam se hi raajnneeti main aae
 From the political point of view Firozpur Cantt was a peaceful place
 chhavnee se teen mile dur shahar ke lacture or jalse hote rahete the
 Even khadi used to be propagated
 1921 main, asahyog andolan ke samay yashpal atharah varsh ke navayuvak the—desh-seva or rashtrabhakti ke utsaah se bharpoor, videshi kapadon kii holi ke saath ve congress ke prachaar-abhiyaan main bhi bhaag lete the
 Khaddar kurta-pajama and Gandhi used to wear hats made from household slugs
 isi khaddar kaa ek kot bhi unhone banwaaya tha
 Tired of getting muddy again and again, they had him red colored
 is kaal main apane bhaashanon main, british samrajyavad virdohi aankadon ke strot ke rup main, ve desh-darshan naamak jis pustak kaa ullekh karte hai vah sambhawatah 1904 main prakashit sakhaaraam ganesh deuskar kii bangla pustak desherkatha he, bhartiya jan-maanas par jisaki chhap vyapak pratikriya or lokapriyata ke kaaran british sarkaar ne jis par pabandi laga di thi
 The cause of Yashpal's immediate disenchantment with Mahatma Gandhi and Gandhism may have been announced on 12 February 22, after the chaura-chauri scandal by Mahatma Gandhi, but it had begun earlier
 yashpal or unke krantikari saathiyon kaa sashastr kranti kaa jo agenda tha, gandhi kaa ahimsa kaa siddhant uske virodh main jaataa tha
 He found the mixing of religion and politics by Mahatma Gandhi to be fundamentally wrong
 metric ke baad lahore aane par yashpal neshnal college main bhagatsingh, sukhdev or bhagwaticharan bohara ke sampark main aae
 His extensive and active participation in the activities of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha was in fact an inevitable result of his disenchantment with Gandhi and Gandhism
 noujvaan bharat sabha ke mukhya sutradhaar bhagwaticharan or bhagat singh the
 While commenting on the possible goals, Yashpal writes, 'the program of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha is to inspire the public by criticizing the compromise policy of the Gandhian Congress and to point out a fundamental difference between the revolutionaries and Mahatma Gandhi and the Gandhians in the masses
 Will be useful lala lajpatraay kii hinduvadi nitiyon se ghor virodh ke baavjood unpar hue lathi charge ke kaaran, jisase hi antat unki mrityu hui, bhagatsingh or unke saathiyon ne sanders kii hatya kii
 He saw this incident as a national insult whose resistance needed to be forgotten
 bhagatsingh dwaara asembli main bam-cond isi soch kii ek taarkik parinti thi, lekin bhagatsingh, sukhdev or raajaguru kii phaansi ke virodh main mahatma gandhi ne janata kii ore se vyapak dabaav ke baavjood, koi aupchaarik apil tak jari nahin kii
 In the memoirs of his revolutionary life, which Yashpal wrote in an overview, he evaluated that movement and his colleagues in his vision
 taarkikta, vaastaviktaa or vishwasaneeyata par unhone hameshaa jor diya he
 It is possible that many may disagree with that assessment or Yashpal is accused of distorting the facts
 aaj bhi kuch log aise hai, jo yashpal ko bahut acha krantikari nahin maanate
 In the context of his revolutionary life, he carries the character of his characterization as completely true and perhaps that is why he considers my constant and frequent return to Yashpal as something like a 'sand idol'
 ‘kranti’ ko bhi ve bam-pistaulavaali raajnneeti kranti tak hi simit karke dekhte hai
 The political revolution was a part of the revolutionary change in the social system for Yashpal
 samrajyavad ko ve ek shoshankari vyavastha ke rup main dekhte the, jo bhagatsingh ke shabdon main, ‘manushya ke haathon manushya ke or raashtra ke haathon raashtra ke shoshan kaa charam rup he’

 jagmohan or chamanlal, sanskaran ’19, pri
321) is vyavastha ke aadhaar stambh-jagiradaari or zameendaari vyavastha bhi usee tarah unke virodh ke mukhya agenda ke antargat aate the
 In the form of independence in the country and like many, they too were not satisfied
 swadhinata se adhik ve ise satta kaa hastantaran maanate the
 And it was almost like Premchand had once expressed his apprehension as sitting on the throne to Govind instead of John
 krantikari rashtra bhakthi or balidaan kii bhaavana se prerit-sanchalit yuvak the
 He always attested this by sacrificing the occasion
 lekin yashpal apane saathiyon ko irshyaa-dwesh, spardhaa-aakankshawale saadhaaran manushyon ke rup main dekhe jane par bal dete hai
 In his memoirs, Rajendra Yadav today declares the ideal - 'he is not a deity' - he begins in Hindi with exactly these memoirs of Yashpal
 ye krantikari saamaanya manushyon se kuch alag, visisth or apane lakshyon ke liye ekantik rup se samarpit hone par bhi saamaanya maanviya anubhutiyon se achoote nahin the
 Could have happened
 sharathchandra ne patheradavi main krantikariyon kaa jo adarsh rup prastut kiya, yashpal use avastavik maanate the, jisase rashtrabhakti kii prerana milti ho, use krantikari andolan or us jivan ko vaastaviktaa kaa ek pratinidhi or pramanik chitra nahin mana ja saktaa
 Subodhchandra Sen sees the disintegration of Savyasachi as a metaphor for the exodus of future magnate Subhash Chandra Bose on the electric storm waterfall night at Gupta Pathredawi, while Yashpal sees the real life of Sabyasachi's superhuman activities and life spent in lair-ruins And not considered authentic
 krantikari jivan ke apane lambey anubhavon ko hi ve apni is aalochana ke mukhya aadhaar ke rup main istemaal karte hai
 2, after his release from prison on March 38, when Yashpal started publishing and editing Viplav in November the same year, he defined his work as 'bullet Bulletin'
 jis ahimsak or samtamulak samaaj kaa nirmaan ve raajnneetik krantikari ke madhyam se karnaa chaahate the, usee adhure kaam ko aage badhaane ke liye unhone lekhan ko apana aadhaar banaaya
 Literature written at the center of the socio-political problems of its time is often always called as ideological
 nand dulaare vaajapeyi kaa premchand ke viruddh bada aarope yahi tha
 Yashpal answered almost the same as Premchand to the charge of propaganda
 apane pehle upanyaas dada commered kii bhoomika main unhone likhaa, ‘kala ke premiyon ko ek shikaayat mere prati he ki kala ko gaun or prachaar ko pramukh sthaan detaa hoon
 i do not have to appeal against this decision given to me
 santosh he apana abhipraay spasht kar paata hum


 apane lekhkeey sarokaaron par or vistaar se tippanee karte hue baad main unhone likhaa, ‘manushya ke purna vikaas or mukti ke liye sangharsh karnaa hi lekhak kii sarthakata he
 When the author shows contradiction in the old system and ideas for the liberation of man through his art and puts forth new ideals, then he is accused of being idealless and materialistic
 aaj ke lekhak kii jaden vaastaviktaa main hai, isliye vah bhautikwaadi to he hi parantu vah adarshaheen bhi nahin he
 His inspiration is more real
 aaj kaa lekhak jab apni kala dwaara nae aadarshon kaa samarthan karata he to us par prachaarak hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya jaataa he
 The writer always creates sympathy or opposition to an idea or ideal through his art
 sahitya vichaarpurn hoga
 The major genre of Yashpal's writing is novel, but he started his writing with stories
 unki kahaniyaan apane samay kii raajnneeti se us rup main aakraant nahin hai, jaise unke upanyaas
 In the era of the new story, against the artificial division of the body and mind of the woman, the image of an entire woman, which was emphasized, begins with Yashpal
 aaj kii kahani ke soch kii jo disha he, usamen yashpal kii kitni hi kahaniyaan bataur khaad istemaal hui he
 Their significance is unambiguous in terms of the possibilities of the present and the future story-scenario
 unke kahani-sangrahon main pinjre kii udaan, gyandaan, bhasmavrutt chinagaari, phulon kaa kurta, dharmayuddh, tumne kyon kaha tha main sundar hoon or uttami kii maan pramukh hai
 The map of what Yashpal had come from active politics to literature to create a world was very clear from the beginning
 unhone kisi yutapia kii jagah vyavastha kii vaastavik uplabdhiyon ko hi apana aadhaar banaaya tha
 In Yashpal's ideological journey, this sutra appears active from beginning to end, that the broad cooperation and active participation of the people are the main factors in the formation and development of a nation
 yashpal har jagah janata ke vyapak hiton ke samarthak or sangrakshak lekhak hai
 When Yashpal defines his journalism and writing as 'bulletin instead of bullet', in a way, he is commenting on his creative concerns
 aise durdharsh lekhak ke pratinidhi rachanakarm kaa yah sanchayan use sampoornataa main jaanane-samajhane ke liye prerit karegaa, aisa hamaara vishwaas he

 sheikh abdulla ke netritv main muslim conference us samay kashmir kii mukhya rajnatik party thi
 Kashmiri Pandits, Sheikh Abdullah and most of the Muslims of the state wanted to merge Kashmir with India
 par pakistan ko ye bardaasht hi nahin tha ki koi muslim-bahumat praant bharat main rahe 
 So in 1947-48, Pakistan invaded Kashmiri with tribes and its camouflage army and seized much of it
 us samay pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne mohammad ali jinna se vivaad janamat-sangrah se sulajhane kii peshkash kii, jise jinna ne us samay thukraa diya kyonki unako apni sainik karrwai par puraa bharosa tha

 vah sarvavidit he ki pan nehru tathaa mountabeton ke paraspar vishesh sambandh the, jo kisi bhi bhartiya congressi yaa muslim netaa ke aapas main na the
 It was due to Pandit Nehru's efforts that Mountbatten was made the first Governor General of independent India, while Jinnah refused to accept Mountbatten as the first Governor General of Pakistan, which Mountbatten had regretted all his life
 mountabeton 24 march 1947 se 30 june 1948 tak bharat main rahe
 In these fifteen months he was not only the constitutional head but also decisive of India's important policies
 pan nehru unhen sadaiv apana mitra, maardarshak tathaa mahanatam salaahkaar maanate rahe
 He also considered Pandit Nehru as a "brilliant", "always reliable" "imaginative" and "theoretical socialist"
 kashmir ke prashn par bhi mountabeton ke vichaaron ko pan nehru ne atyadhik mahatv diya
 Pandit Nehru also had deep ties with Sheikh Abdullah

 He was then appointed a teacher in a high school in Srinagar, but was dropped from the school due to indiscipline

 He finally tried his luck in Kashmir politics in 1932 and established the "muslim Conference", which was only for Muslims
 parantu 1939 main iske dwaar anya panthon, majahabon ke maanane waalon ke liye bhi khol die gaye or iskaa naam "neshnal conference" rakh diya tathaa isane pandit nehru ke praja mandal aandolan se apane ko jod liya

 Sheikh Abdullah kept changing his vocabulary from time to time and also tricked Pandit Nehru

 Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and now Rahul Gandhi is going on with Sheikh Abdullah, Farooq Abdullah and currently Omar Abdullah respectively
 durbhaagya se kashmir ke maharaja hari singh se na hi shaikh abdulla ke or na hi pandit nehru ke sambandh achche rah paae
 The Maharaja was familiar with the devious tricks of Kashmir Sheikh Abdullah, selfish and separatist thinking and anti-hindu attitude in Kashmir
 ve isse bhi parichit the ki "quit kashmir aandolan" ke dwaara shaikh abdulla maharaja ko hataakar, swayan shashan sanbhaalane ko aatur he
 While Pandit Nehru became the interim Prime Minister of India, an incident further exacerbated this acrimony
 shaikh abdulla ne srinagar kii ek conferes main pandit nehru ko aane kaa nimantran diya tha
 The main proposal in this conference was to remove Maharaja Kashmir
 majaboor hokar maharaja ne pan nehru se is kfrons main na aane ko kaha
 However, Pandit Nehru was stopped in Jammu before going to Srinagar
 pan nehru ne ise apana apmaan samajha tathaa ve ise jivan bhar na bhuule
 In order to teach a lesson to Raja Hari Singh at the time of Pakistani army and tribal invasion, Nehru ji deliberately delayed sending the Indian army, which succeeded in capturing two-third of Kashmir

 Jinnah wanted the suzerainty of Pakistan over Kashmir and Hyderabad
 unhone apane sainya sachiv ko teen baar maharaja kashmir se milane ke liye bheja
 The then Prime Minister of Kashmir Kak also promised to meet him
 par maharaja ne baar-baar beemaari kaa bahaanaa banaakar baatcheet ko taal diya
 Jinnah wanted to spend the summer vacation in Kashmir
 parantu maharaja ne vinamratapurvak is aagrah ko taalte hue kaha tha ki vah ek padosi desh ke garvanar general ko tehraane kii aupchaarikta puri nahin kar paaenge
 On the other hand, Sheikh Abdullah was eager to grab the throne and make it a Muslim state

 On the other hand, Mountbatten also stayed in Kashmir for three days in the month of June

 But the Government of India remained indifferent even to the repeated request of the new Prime Minister of Kashmir, Mehrchandra Mahajan
 bharat sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag ne bhi is sandarbh main koi purv jaankaree nahin di
 Brigadier Rajendra Singh of Kashmir tried to stop the army of Pakistan with 250 soldiers without uniform and all of them attained heroism

 But it was not decided in the meeting to give any kind of assistance to the Maharaja

 Martin Buber was an Austrian-born Jewish philosopher best known for his philosophy of dialogue
 samvaad kaa darshan dharmik astitvvaad kaa ek rup he jo ai-daau sambandh or ai-it sambandh ke bich bhed par kendrit he
 Born in Vienna, Buber belonged to a devout Jewish family, but broke away from Jewish practices to pursue secular studies in philosophy
 1902 main, buber jionvadee andolan kii kendriya patrika di velt saptahik ke sampadak ban gaye, haalanki unhone baad main khud ko jionwad ke sanghathanaatmak kaaryon se baahar kar liya
 In 1923 Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, Ich und Du, and in 1925 he began translating the Hebrew Bible into German
 1930 main buber francfort vishvavidhyalay am mine ke maanad professor ban gaye or 1933 main adolf hitler ke satta main aane ke turant baad hi apane professor pad se istipha de diya

 Buber's wife Paula died in 1958 and died on 13 June 1965 at her home in Talbiyah, Jerusalem

 His grandfather, Solomon Buber, who spent much of Buber's childhood at his home in Lemberg, was a noted scholar of Midrash and Rabi literature
 ghar main buber yahudi or german bolte the
 In 1892, Buber returned to his father's house in Lemberg
 He broke off from Jewish religious practices due to a personal religious crisis: he began reading Emmanuel Kant, Soren Kirkgaard and Friedrich Nietzsche
 vishesh rup se baad vaali do vibhootiyon ne unhen darshan main padhai karne ke liye prerit kiya
 In 1896, Buber went to study in Vienna
 In 1898, he joined the Jewish movement and started participating in conferences and organizational functions
 In 1899, while studying in Zürich, Buber met his future wife, Paula Winkler, a non-jewish Zionist writer from Munich who later accepted Judaism
 buber kii vicharottejak or kabhi-kabhi kaavyatmak lekhan style ne unki kritiyon main pramukh vishay-vastuon ko pesh kiya he: isamen hasidic kathaon kaa punarvachan, bible kii kahaniyaan or aadhyatmik charchaaen hai
 As a cultural zionist, Buber was active in Israel and the Jewish and academic community of Germany
 He was on the acrimonious side of a two-nation solution to Palestine, and after the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel, he spoke of the regional union of Israel and the Arab state
 Their influence goes beyond the humanities, particularly social psychology, social philosophy, philosophical anarchism and religious existentialism
 zionizam ke prati apni vyaktigat drushtikon ke aadhaar par buber zionizam kii saanskrithik or raajnneetik disha ke bare main theodor herkel ke vichaaron se asahmat the
 Herzl envisioned a nation-state as the goal of zionism, but did not consider Jewish culture or religion necessary
 In contrast, Buber believed that zionism's power is for social and spiritual prosperity
 herkel or buber ne aapasi sammaan or asahmati ke saath apana shesh jivan apane sambandhit lakshyon kii disha main kaam karte hue bitaayaa
 In 1902, Buber became the editor of the weekly de Welt, a central part of the Zionist movement
 haalanki, ek saal baad buber yahudee hasidizam andolan ke saath jud gaye
 Buber praised how Hasidic communities have implemented their religion in daily life and culture
 vyast zionist sanghathan ke nitant vipareet, jo hameshaa raajnneetik chintaaon par vichaar karata he, hasidim un mulyon par kendrit the jisaki vakaalat buber ne lambey samay se zionizam ke liye kii thi
 In 1904, Buber withdrew from most of his Zionist organizational work and devoted himself to study and writing
 us varsh unhone apana shodh prakashit kiya: Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems 
 From 1910 to 1914, Buber studied myths and published mythological texts
 1916 main ve berlin se heppenhim chale gaye
 During the First World War, he helped establish the Jewish National Commission to improve the condition of the Jews of Eastern Europe
 During that period, he edited Der Jude, a Jewish monthly
 In 1921 Buber began a close relationship with Franz Rozenzwaig
 1922 main buber or rozenjwaig ne rozenjwaig ke house of juish larning kaa sah-sanchaalan kiya, jise germany main lirhouse kaha gaya
 In 1923 Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, Ich und Du
 Although he edited it later in his life, he refused to make much changes to it
 In 1925, he began translating the Hebrew Bible into German in conjunction with Franz Rozenzwaig
 unhone khud is anuwaad ko Verdeutschung kaha, kyonki isamen hameshaa saahitiyik german bhashaa kaa prayog nahin kiya gaya he balki ek nae gatisheel samakaksh vaakya-vinyas kii khoj kaa prayaas kiya gaya he taaki mul bahu-sanyojak hebrew kaa sammaan bana rahe
 1926 or 1928 ke bich buber ne tremasik di kriyetur ) kaa sampaadan kiya
 In 1930 Buber became an honorary professor at Frankfurt University Am Mine
 1933 main adolf hitler ke satta main aane ke turant baad hi unhone virodh swaroop apane professor pad se istipha de diya
 4 oktober 1933 ko naaji adhikariyon ne unhen vyaakhyaan dene se manaa kar diya
 1935 main unhen Reichsschrifttumskammer se nishkasit kar diya gaya
 He then established the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews to participate in public education
 This institution was rapidly disrupted by the Nazi administration
 ant main, 1938 main, buber ne germany chhod di or mendate philistin kii rajdhani jerushlem main bas gaye
 He received a professorship at the Hebrew University there and began lecturing on sociology and introductory anthropology
 He participated in the discussion of the problems of the Jews in Palestine and the question of Arabia - which was beyond his biblical, philosophical, and Hasidic work
 ve ishud samooh ke sadsy ban gaye, jiskaa uddeshy arab or philistin main yahudiyon ke liye dwi-rashtriya rajya kaa nirmaan tha
 Such a bi-national association has a more appropriate adherence to zionism according to Buber than the creation of a purely Jewish state
 1946 main unhone paths in utapia prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane commune aadhaarit samaajawaadee vichaaron kaa varnan kiya or apane "sanvadatmak samudaay" siddhant kii baat rakhi jo parsparik "sanvadatmak sambandhon" par aadhaarit thi
 After World War II, Buber began lecturing in the United States and Europe
 buber, sanvadatmak astitv ke apane synthetic thisis ke liye prasiddh hai, jaisaa ki unhone main or tum pustak main varnit kiya
 However, in his works he has discussed various topics, including religious consciousness, modernity, the concept of evil, morality, education and biblical hermeneutics
 main or tum main buber ne maanav astitv par apana shodh prastut kiya
 Partially inspired by Foyerbach's The Essence of Christianity and Kirkgaard's "single One", Buber worked on survival as an encounter
 unhone is darshan ko ish-du or ish-es ke shabd jode kaa upyog karte hue samajhaayaa or chetana, antalakriya or astitv jisase ek vyakti anya vyaktiyon, nirjeev vastuon or saamaanya rup se sabhi vaastaviktaa ke saath sampark karata he
 Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about types of existence - particularly how a person lives and executes that existence
 As Buber argues in i and you, a person engages with the world at all times in one of these methods
 astitv ke dohare prakaaron ko varnit karne ke liye jis jatigat roopankan kaa buber istemaal karte hai vah he samvaad or ekalaap 
 samvaad, kii avadharana, vishesh rup se bhashaa-unmukh samvaad kaa istemaal rupakon ke madhyam se samvaad / ekalaap kaa varnan karne or maanav astitv ke parsparik prakruti ko vyakt karne main istemaal hota he
 Ish-do is a relation that emphasizes the mutual, total existence of two beings
 yah ek thos aamanaa-saamana he, kyonki ye do praani apane pramanik astitv main ek duusare se milte hai, bina kisi yogyata yaa ek duusare par sawaal kiye milte hai
 Even imagination and thought do not play a part in this regard
 main-tum maamle main, ananthata or saarvbhaumikta vaastavik ban jate hai 
 Buber emphasized that an ish-do relationship lacks any composition and does not communicate any content
 Despite the fact that ish-do cannot be proven as an event, Buber insists that it is real and can be seen
 dainik jivan main ish-du rishton ko spasht karne ke liye vibhinn udhaaharan kaa upyog kiya gaya he - do premi, ek billi or ek darshak, ek lekhak or vriksh or ek train par do ajanabi
 ish-du rishton ko spasht karne ke liye jin aam angreji shabdon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he unamem shaamil he, incounter, meeting, dialog, muuality or exange
 a major ish-do relationship that Buber identified was the relationship between God and man
 Buber argues that this is the way by which one can interact with God and somehow connects with the eternal in an ish-doo relationship
 bhagwaan ke saath is main-tum sabandh banane ke liye, ek vyakti ko ek aise rishte ke vichaar ke liye khulaa he, lekin nahin sakriy rup se ise aage badhaane kaa ho gaya he
 The qualities that develop from following such a relationship are related to this and therefore one-to-one relationship can be stopped
 Buber claims that while being ready for i-tum, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome
 iske alaava, buber varnan karte hai ki chunki bhagwaan puri tarah se gunon se rahit he, yah main-tum rishta tab tak chalata he jab tak vyakti kii ichha rahati he
 When the person finally returns to the i-it, they serve as a pillar of deep connection and community
 ish-es sambandh ish-du kaa lagbhag vipareet he
 Where two beings encounter in Ish-do, the beings in Ish-es do not actually meet
 iske bajaay, "main" ek vichaar kaa saamana karata he or or visheshit karata he, yaa uski upasthiti main avadharana nirmit karata he or us praani ko ek vastu ke rup main letaa he
 All such objects are considered to be mere mental representations, which are constructed from the individual mind
 yah vichaar aanshik rup se kaant ke phenomena siddhant par aadhaarit he or iske anusaar ye vasteen vyakti ke sangyanatmak man main maujuud rahete he
 Therefore, the ish-s relationship is in itself a relationship with the fact, it is not a conversation, but a monologue
 ish-es rishte main ek vyakti ke vyavhaar aadi anya baton ko vastuon ke rup main istemaal or anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 Essentially, an object can serve a person's interest - basically, this form of objectivity relates to the world in its own case
 buber kaa tark tha ki maanav jivan ish-es or ish-du ke bich main dolata rahata he or kaha ki vastav main ish-du kaa anubhav kaaphi kam or madhyam hota he
 In examining the various perceived evils of modernity, Buber believed that the extension of viewing existence is based on a material analytic and purely Ish – s relationship
 buber ne tark diya ki is pratimaan ne na keval astitv kaa avamulyan kiya, balki sabhi astitv ke arth kaa avamulyan kiya
 Ish UND Do has been translated from German into several other languages
 tathaapi, kyonki buber kaa german upyog atyadhik muhaavareydaar or aksar aparamparaagat tha, yah baat swaabhaavik vivaad kaa vishay he ki unke lekhan ke jatil sandesh ko sahi rup main kaise vyakhyayit kiya jaae
 angreji-bhashi vishwa main ek mahatvapurn bahes ish-es or ish-du ke sahi anuwaad ke aasapaas kendrit rahi he
 The word "do" is used in German, while in English, two different translations are used: "dau" and "yu"
 The main problem is how to translate the very personal, even intimate German "do", which has no direct equivalent in modern English
 smith ne tark diya ki "daau" dharmik or aadar sambandhi nihitarth rakhata he jo buber kahana chaahate the 
 kauboman kaa kahana he ki yah shabd avaiyaktik or puraatan he, yah antarang baatcheet main upyog kiya jaataa he
 Despite this debate, Buber's book is widely known in the English-speaking world as i & dau, probably because Smith's translation came years before Kauffmann
 haalanki, smith or counmaan, donon kaa anuwaad vyapak rup se uplabdh he
 Buber was a scholar, interpreter and translator of Hasidic lore
 unhone hasidizam ko yahudee dharm ke liye saanskrithik naveekaran ke ek strot ke rup dekha, aksar hasidic parampara se udhaaharan liya ki samudaay, parsparik jivan kaa hawala dete hue bal diya he or aam gatividhiyon main arth diya he
 According to Buber the Hasidic ideal emphasizes life that is spent in the unconditional presence of God, where there is no clear division between daily habits and religious experience
 buber ke maanav-vigyaan darshan par is baat kaa vishesh prabhaav rahaa he, jo maanav ke astitv ke aadhaar par samvaad par vichaar karata he
 In 1906, Buber published De Geschitan des Rabbi Nakhman, a collection of tales of Breslov's Nakhman, the famous Hasidic Rebbe, described by Buber in a neo-hasidic style
 do saal baad, buber ne di legenda des balshem prakashit kiya, ve hasidizam ke sansthaapak the
 Buber's interpretation of the Hasidic tradition, however, has been criticized by scholars such as Chaim Potak for its romantic style
 tels of hasidizam ke buber ke parichay main potak ne tipanni kii ki buber ne hasidizam kii "kathvaidhata, pragativirodh, aapasi jhagade, uske lurianik daastaa kii baari maal kii dhulaai kii lok andhvishwaas or peet jyadatiyon, iske jaadik puja, iske gande or lurianik kaabbala kii andekhi kii
" isse bhi adhik gambhir aalochana yah he ki buber ne hasidizam main yahudee kanoon ke mahatv par koi bal nahin diya
 yah vidambnaa hi he, is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ki aksar buber ne hasidizam main yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki vyakti kii dharmikata main lakeer kaa fakir yaa panthiy dharm kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Martin Buber had already begun advocating for a bi-national jewish-arab state in the early 1920s, stating that Jewish people should "articulate their desire to fraternize and live in peace with Arabia" And in the development of a common republic country in which both people can see the possibility of free development, it should be done
 " buber ne zionizam ke vichaar ko maatr ek rashtriya andolan ke rup main maanane se asweekaar kar diya or iske bajaay ek anukaraniya samaaj ke nirmaan kii ichha dikhaai, ek samaaj jo unhone kaha, arabon ke yahudee daman se chihnit nahin hoga
 zionizam ke liye yah zaruri tha ki vah arab ke saath kisi sahamati par pahunche tab bhi agar yahudee desh main ek alpsankhyak ke rup main rahete hai
 In 1925, he was involved in the creation of the organization Brit Shelm, which talks about the creation of a two-nation, and for the rest of his life he hoped and believed that one day Jews and Arabs would live in peace in a United Nations
 Nevertheless, he was associated with the Zionist for decades and with many philosophers, including Chaim Weizmann, Max Brode, Hugo Bergmann, and Felix Welsh, from his old European times in Paraguay to Berlin in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, and He remained friends until Vienna and Jerusalem
