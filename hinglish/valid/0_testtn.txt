 The word design as a noun is used in two meanings - aajkal prakriyaayonko bhi dizin kaa parinaam mana jaataa he
 Process design is used in this sense
 dizin ke antargat bahut se lakshya nirdhaarit kiye gayi hote hai

 Similarly, the building engineer assigns various measurements to a building to ensure its durability and firmness
 sabhi baaten abhiklpana ke antargat hai
 It is the duty of the architect to present a viable design that is convenient and economical in the goal of building construction
 saath hi use yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki imaarat kaa aakaar us kshetra ke pados ke anukool ho or apane id-gird khadi puraani imaaraton ke saath bhi uskaa mail baith sake

 isi tarah or bhi kai baaten hai jinka vichaar parshvavarti vaataavaran ko drushti main rakhte hue kiya janaa chahie
 The second special thing that is considered for the architect is the decision of a stable opinion about the exterior shape of the building
 vah aisa hona chahie ki ek raah chalata vyakti bhi bhawan ko dekhakar puche bina yah samaj le ki vah bhawan kisalie bana he
 For example, a college should not look like a hospital, nor should the shape of a hospital be like a college
 banks kaa bhawan dekhne main pusht or surakshit laganaa chahie or naatakghar yaa cinemaghar kaa bahari drishy shobhaneey hona chahie
 The architect should be sure that he has made full use of the entire area on which he has to build the building

 In estimating the weight, the weight of the building itself, its moving load when it is being built or used, the impact of shock of moving loads, wind pressure, the result of earthquake bumps, heating, shrinkage, foundation seating etc
 Have to keep in mind

 The safety factor should not be used as an excuse to carry additional load on the building

 a brief description of the five aspects of crisis leadership includes the following: hanchanahal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke anantpur jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Interpretation is the expression of any kind of waves of reciprocal processes, resulting in an increase, decrease, or indifference to vibrations and their effects in certain situations
 vyatikaran kaa vistrut adhyayan vishaal vibhedan shakti vaale sabhi yantron ke mul main kaam karata he
 Tomas Young incorporated this concept in physical optics
 unke baad vyatikaran kaa vyavhaar kisi bhi tarah kii tarangon yaa companon ke samavet yaa tajjanya prabhaavon ko vyakt karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In short, the situation arising out of the collision of waves due to any kind of waveform is termed as interference
 jab kabhi jal yaa anya kisi drav kii sataha par do bhinn tarangasamooh ek saath milen to vyatikaran kii sthiti utpann ho sakati he
 Where the wavelengths of waves belonging to one waveform are incorporated by the wavelengths of the waves belonging to another chain, the elevation of the surface of the fluid is equal to the sum of possible elevations of the independent and solitary existence of the waves at that location
 jab tarangon main se ek ke tarangashring kaa duusare ke tarangagart par samapathan hota he, tab drav kii sataha par tarangon kaa udwelan kam ho jaataa he or pratifalit unnayan ek tarang avyav ke unnayan or duusare ke avanayan ke antar ke baraabar hota he
 The vibrations produced in a sound are a simple form of this interference, where two or more waveforms, with a slight difference in wavelength, are found moving in the same direction
 prakaash kii gat tarangeey hoti he
 The energy released from a single light source is disintegrated on the lateral side of the medium
 yadi prakaash ke do swatantra strot, jinase samaan pariman or abhinn kala kii tarangen satat ni:sruth hon, ek duusare ke sannikat rakhe jaaen, to madhyam ke aasapaas urja kaa vitaran samang nahin hota, jahaan ek prakashtarang kaa shrung duusare prakashtarang ke shrung par, yaa ek kaa tarangagart duusare ke tarangagart par girtaa he, vahaan aayam bad jaataa he or aayam swaroop urja yaa prakaash kii tivrata bhi bad jaati he
 Also, if the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the resulting amplitude is zero and the intensity of light decreases
 pehali sthiti kaa samposhi vyatikaran or duusari sthiti ko vinashi vyatikaran kehete hai
 Thin bars of transparent solids and light bubbles on soap bubbles can give a clear introduction to interference
 jab prakaash kii kirane sabun ke bulabulon, yaa sise kii patale patton par padati hai, to unki bahari or bhitari donon satahon se kirane paravartit hokar prekshak kii aankhon kii ore lautati hai or prakaash ke tarangasamoohon main, jo donon sroton se aankhon tak pahunchati hai, kalaon main sookshm antar hone ke kaaran vyatikaran hota he, jisase utpann prabhaav kaaphi mohak ore chittkarshak hote hai
 a soap bubble is often seen covered with some black lines in a monochromatic light
 kaaran yah he ki kaale dikhaai padanevaale binduon par prakaash ke do tarangasamooh, jo kramash: bulbule kii bhitari or bahari satahon se aate hai, kareeb kareeb yaa purnat: ek duusare ke prabhaav ko nasht kar dete hai
 If the bubble is seen in white light, we usually do not see black lines
 unke sthaan par rangon kii pattiyaan hoti hai
 This is because different colors, the sum of which produces white light, are of different waves, so that interfering at a point of the bubble destroys only a fraction of the color and the remaining elements of the bright light remain
 , Which produce its full chromatic effect on the eyes
 vyatikaran ke liye kuch moulik sharte hai jinaki purti aavashyak he
 Some of these are inherent in the nature of light itself and other, if the result is to be observed by experiment, it becomes necessary
 saralata ke liye ham do vidyut chumbakeey laharon par vichaar kar sakate hai, jo kisi dikbindu par, jahaan se donon lehren guzarati hai, vinashi vyatikaran utpann karen
 If the pattern of interference remains constant, that is, if the resulting light intensity is zero for each value of time at the resulting so-called point, then the following conditions must be met: prakaash dwaara utpann pratirupon ke safal prekshan ke liye do anya sharten, jinaki purti honi chahie, nimnlikhit hai, If two superimposed light sources of equal magnitude and time lines meet at a point in a far-away curtain at a particular point of time, then some exactly lines on the screen with lines of maximum intensity in the gap are seen
 ve nunatam or adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen vyatikaran fringen kehalaati hai
 Whenever the fringe fringes are formed by thin films, they are caused by the change in the frequency of the rays participating in the fission
 yah parivartan film kii motaai ke parivartan, yaa aaytan kone ke parivartan, ke kaaran hota he
 If the thickness is not congruent, then often both facts become functional simultaneously; But one thing is clear that when a film is being watched by the eye, it is about 25 cm from the eye
 Should be kept at a distance of
 yadi film kaa paraas bahut bada na ho, to hamaari aankhon tak film ke vibhinn binduon se aati hui kirnon ke jhukaav kii bhinnata koi adhik nahin hoti or prayek kiran kaa aaytan kone kareeb kareeb samaan hota he
 Hence the fringes are formed mainly due to the variation of film thickness
 yah bhi nitant spasht he ki film ke un sabhi binduon par, jahaan motaai samaan he, vahaan prakaash kii dipti bhi samaan hogi
 If any such point is black or bright, the rest will be black or bright accordingly
 isliye kaali yaa ujwal pattiyaan samaan motaai ke film ke vibhinn binduon ke bindupath maatr hoti he
 Such fringes are called the Newtonian rings, because Newton first studied them

 Kaal is at least one of the four qualities, with emotion, voice and aspect, which can make the expression clear
 kaal ek abhivyakti ke ghatnakram ke saath samayik sandarbhon kaa viparyaas vyatirek darshaate hai
 All languages use the same tense - present, past and future, although the expression of these tenses cannot always be explicitly translated from one language to another
 While all languages have typical forms of verbs by which they are identified and sorted into dictionaries, generally the most common present tense or a simple form, the methods used to express their tenses, differ between languages
 kuch aisi bhashaaen hai jinamein kaal kriya rup ke madhyam se antahkunchit nahin hota or na hi sanrachanaatmak drushti se abhivyakt hota he, balki iske bajaay, jab bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tab, samayik kriya visheshan ke istemaal se antarnihit kiya jaataa he or kuch main samayik jaankaree antahkunchit visheshan ke istemaal dwaara prakat hoti he

 In many texts, the term time mistakenly refers to the quality of uncertainty, frequency, nudity, duration, probability, and even whether information is derived from experience or from rumor
 It is not actually tenses, but traditional nomenclature often classifies them as such
 hakeekat main, sabhi bhashaaon main saamaan kaal hote hai
 They are usually divided into three groups - present, past and future, in which each category is defined in a defined sense
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhoot kaal vah hote hai jinamein swayan kathan ke samayik sandarbh se pehle avyav kriya ke samayik sandarbh ghatit hote hai
 Past tense can range from simple past / past to immediate past / past, distant or distant past / past as well, there is only one difference between them and that is, the distance on the events between the occasional reference points
 angrezi main kaal do prakaar ke samoohon main vibhajit he - shuddh kaal or kriyabhaav dyotak kaal
 shuddh kaal vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya kii un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein dwitiyak samayik sandarbh purnataya nishchit samajha yaa janaa jaataa he
 In other words, pure tense refers to expressions in which attestation is believed to be true or known
 duusari ore, kriyabhaav dyotak kaal vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya kii un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann kii nischitata purnataya nishchit nahin he
 In English, this form is expressed by adding a verb adverb, adverb signifier adverb or adverb signifier adverb
 kriya ghataane se keval angrezi main bhoot kaal abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In all the raw and infallible aspects, the past tense is expressed using the indirect form of the aspectual complement, tha / were, to be)
 gaiyr-kalavadhi pahaluon main, bhoot kaal ek vishesh antahkunchit rup ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he jisamen abhimukhataa poorak 'kar liya' ko chhod kar avyav kriya kaa paroksh upyog kiya gaya he
 This form is possible only in a few positive lectures
 kathan ke sabhi anya prakaaron main, pheravat rup niojit kiya janaa chahie
 The present tense is expressed by an unmarked form similar to the past tense, but in this the aspectual complement is only forbidden in agreement with the person and number is / is, is / is) in the inflection forms
 jaisaa ki bhoot kaal ke saath he antahkunchit rup kuch sakaaratmak vyakhyanon ke liye upyog kiye ja sakate hai
 In English, the pure future tense is expressed in the same way as the present tense, but with a future-signifying adverb or time phrase
 angrezi main kriyabhaav dyotak kaal yaa to ek purnataya sweekrut kriyabhaav dyotak rup ke istemaal dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he yaa ek atirikt kriyabhaav dyotak kriya visheshan yaa padbandh ke saath ek shuddh kaal rup dwaara
 angrezi main kriyabhaav dyotak kaal sabase aksar bhavishyakaal abhivyakt karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The verb denote future refers to any of the eight future forms in which attestation cannot be called true due to the uncertain nature of future results
 These forms vary according to certainty and always express that level of future certainty within the intent of a supportive mood
 neeche die gaye soochiptr main "janaa" kriya ke prayog se kuch indo-europi or phino-argic kaal main kaal abhivyakti ke udhaaharan dikhaae gaye hai
 The tenses are broadly classified as present, past, or future
 in vyapak vargikarnon ke bheetar kai sambhavit kaal maujuud hai
 The difference between these periods is mainly the degree of occasional distance from the time of narration
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhoot kaal kii saamaanya shrenee ke bheetar, tatkaal ateet, sudur ateet, dur sudur ateet or doorvarti ateet maujuud ho sakate hai, inamen antar keval kathan ke ghatnakram ke saath kathan ke samay se duuri main badhottaree kaa he

 Swot analysis is a strategic planning sequence used to evaluate the powers, whites, achievements and levels involved in a project or a business enterprise

 The credit for this technique goes to Albert Humphrey, who led a conference at Stanford University in the 1960s and 1970s using data from the Aishwarya 500 companies
 ek swot vishleshan pehle ek vaanchit ant rajya yaa uddeshy ko paribhaashit karne ke saath prarambh hona chahie
 a SWOT analysis can be incorporated into a strategic planning model
 swot env scan vishleshan sahit samrik yojana kaaphi shodh kaa vishay rahaa he
 It is necessary to identify the swotas as the subsequent steps in the planning process to achieve the chosen objective can be achieved with swotas
 pehle, nirnay nirmaataaon ko pataa lagaana hota he ki kya uddeshy saadhy he, nishchit swotus se
 yadi uddeshy saadhy nahin he to ek alag uddeshy chaynit hona chahie or prakriya doharaai jaani chahie
 Swot analysis is often used in the academic community to highlight and identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
 yah vikaas ke liye kshetron kii pahchaan karne main vishesh rup se upyogi he
 Another way to use swot is to match and change
 milan shaktiyon ko avasaron se milan karwaane ke dwaara pratispamaal kiya jaataa he
 Converting means using conversion strategies to convert deficiencies or threats into strengths or opportunities

 J
 Scott Armstrong comments that "people who use swot can infer that they have done a substantial amount of planning work and ignore conscious things like defining company objectives or manipulating ROI for alternative strategies Let's do it
 " menon at al or hill env vestbruk se vishkarsh parinaamon ne dikhalaayaa he ki swot se kaary-sampadan ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 As an alternative to Swot, Armstrong describes a 5-step approach option that leads to better organized performance

 These come from within the company's unique value chain
 swot vishleshan samooh soochna ke tukade do mukhya shreniyon main daalate hai: Internal factors can be seen as strengths or weaknesses depending on their influence on the objectives of the organization
 jo ek uddeshy ke sambandh main shakti darshata he vah kisi anya uddeshy ke liye kamajori ho saktaa he
 Factors may include all 4ps as well as personnel, financial, manufacturing capabilities and many more
 bahya karkon main vyapak aarthik maamle, takneekee badlaav, vidhaan, saamaajik or saanskrithik parivartan, ke saath hi saath bazaar env pratiyogi sthiti main parivartan shaamil ho sakate hai
 Results are often presented as a matrix
 swot vishleshan vargeekaran kaa sirf ek tarika he or isaki apni kamajoriyaan hai
 For example, it may prompt companies to compile inventory rather than thinking about what is really important to achieve objectives
 yah parinamswaroop suchi ko bhi gaiyr-aalochanatmak or bina spasht praathamikta ke prastut karata he taaki, udhaaharan ke liye, kamjor avasar majboot khataron kaa santulan karte hue prathit hon

 a swot fraction that produces no strategy is not important

 Changes in relative performance are consistently identified
 pariyojnaayen jo sambhavit jokhim yaa avasar vasteen ho sakati hai un par prakaash daalaa he
 The swot-view also signifies the underlying strength / weakness factors that are most likely to be affected in terms of the value used
 sanghathan ko apane lakshyon ko hasil karne main yogya banane ke liye, ranneeti or yojanaon ko viksit karne ke ek hisse ke rup main, phir vah sanghathan korporate yojana naamak ek vyavasthit / kathor prakriya kaa upyog karegaa

 Is 10 chapters with 97 paragraphs, and a total of 3,814 words
 samvidhan shabd kaa prayog saadharantaya sankuchit evam vistrut do roopon main hota he
 In broad terms, it is used for all the rules related to the governance of a state
 in niyamon main se kuch niyam nyaayalayon dwaara maanya tathaa lagu kiye jate hai, kintu kuch aise bhi hote hai jo purnataya vaidhanik nahin hote
 Beyond these laws, semi-constitutional rules originate from stereotypes, traditional practices, prevailing practices and legal interpretation
 apane ashuddh rup ke kaaran yah niyam nyaayalayon main manyata nahin pate, kintu phir bhi shashanprabandh kii vyaavhaarikta main inkaa prabhaav shuddh niyamon kaa mishran hi samvidhan hota he
 The legislation of England bears witness to this statement
 anya deshon main samvidhan kaa arth tanik adhik sankuchit rup main hota he, tathaa keval jan vishesh niyamon ke sambandh main hota he jo shashan prabandh ke hetu aadhikarik lekhapatron main aabaddh kar liye jate hai
 As a result, the constitution is one or more documents of a country in which the basic rules of discipline are compiled in the governance of that country
 is arth ke sakshi sanyukt raashtra america tathaa bharat ke samvidhan hai
 The word 'constitution' should be considered whatever, but the basic thing is that a complete study of the constitution of a country is not possible only by observing some written rules
 kaaran, yah to shashan prabandh sambandhi anushaasan kaa ek ansh maatr hote hai
 The complete constitutional introduction can only be possible from the study of all the administrative organs
 udaahranarth, bahudhaa samvidhan sanvida main keval shashan ke mukhya angon - karypalika, vidhaayini sabha, nyaaypalika - kaa hi ullekh hota he
 But the interpretation of the composition of these institutions, the manner of appointment of office bearers etc
 is decided by simple method
 isi prakaar kai deshon main nirvachan niyam, nirvachan kshetra evam prati kshetra ke sadasyon kii sankhya, shaskeey vibhaagon kii rachana tathaa nyaaypalika kaa sanghathan, in sab mahatvapurn kaaryo ko samvidhan main kahin vyakhya nahin hoti; yadi hoti bhi he to bahut saadhaaran rup main, mukhyat: inkaa varnan tathaa niyantran saadhaaran vidhi dwaara hi hota he
 Apart from this, the entire legislature is not confined within the domain of the Legislature, the rules that emerge from the judiciary's interpretation of the statute bring a continual revisionism in the constitution
 phir, rajyaprabandh sambandhi roodhi evam vyavhaar bhi kam prabhavatmak or mahatvapurn nahin hote
 Therefore, only the study of all these parts can complete a comprehensive legal introduction
 kintu 'sanvaidhanik shaastra' shabd kii paridhi main keval shuddh vaidhanik niyam hi aate hai, anya sab sanvaidhanik vyavahaarroop maane jate hai
 There are two types of constitution: written and unwritten
 likhit samvidhan adhiktar ek lekhya yaa kuch sankalit lekhya hote hai
 But the interpretation of the form in which the constitution is implemented is neither completely written nor completely written
 england kaa samvidhan alikhit mana jaataa he kintu vahaan bhi 1701 i
 main act ov setelment, kai repragentation ov pipulj act, 1911 evam 1949 ke parliment act jinke dwaara lard sabha ke adhikaar simit hue, 1679, 1816 evam 1862 ke hebius carpus act tathaa 1947 i
 main crown procedings act nirmit hue
 The importance of these written rules in the Constitution of England is no less than unwritten stereotypes, traditions and practices
 iske vipareet bharat ke vistrut rup se likhit samvidhan main bhi kuch alikhit niyam poorak rup main milte hai, jaise vidhansabhaon evam sadasyon ke visheshadhikaar, raashtrapati tathaa rajyapal kaa mantriparishad se sambandh, sanvaidhanik sankatavastha evam rajyapal kii sthiti, in samast vishyon ke sambandh main samvidhan ke atirikt alikhit niyam hi lagu hote hai
 Other distinctions related to the constitution are - salubrious and landscape, often they are also used as synonyms of unwritten and written respectively
 lard brice ne likhit ke sthaan par paridrid tathaa alikhit ke sthaan par namansheel shabdon kaa prayog sahaj bhav se kiya he
 But this type of mixed use is not appropriate
 vastutah: samvidhan likhit kintu namsheel ho saktaa he or alikhit kintu paridrudh rup kaa ho saktaa he
 In principle, the Parliament of England can only make nominated changes to the constitution of England, and the Prime Minister there may invite ministerial rule by not inviting the Cabinet, but such sudden changes are never functional in practice
 yadi england ke itihaas kii ore drushtipaat kiya jaae to prathit hoga ki parivartan sadaa kramik vikaas ke rup main hue he; aakasmikta kii vahaan koi sambhaavna nahin
 Notwithstanding all these, rules relating to voting, independence reform, the abdication of the power of the Lord's House, and post-war dominion self-government, the constitution of England has changed little over the course of a century
 falat: england kaa samvidhan alikhit hokar bhi namansheel nahin paridrudh rup kaa he
 On the contrary, the Indian constitution is called a scenario, because its amendment process is very complex, where only a majority of the Central Parliament is not enough to amend any subject, but it is also necessary to get a majority of the legislatures of all the states
 aisi jatil vyavastha ke uparaant bhi pichley anek varsho main bhartiya samvidhan main anek sanshodhan ho chuke hai
 The reason for this is that amendment changes and amendments are concerned not only with the written system of amendment action but with the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the major influential political bandits of the country
 yadi ve vaidhanik ruparekha or uske dwaara raajnneetik satta ke vitaran se santusht hoti hai to parivartan nahin hote, anyathaa sanshodhan, aavartan, parivartan avashyambhavi hai
 The reason for the constitutional amendments was the Congress governments under whose control the rule of the central and almost all the states
 atev kisi samvidhan kaa rup namansheel he athwa paridrudh, yah keval us desh kaa sanvaidhanik itihaas hi spasht kar saktaa he
 If changes have been made smoothly, then the constitution of that country is humble, otherwise a scenario
 sanyukt raashtra america ke udhaaharan ke uparaant adhiktar deshon main likhit samvidhan kii pratha prachlit ho gai he
 Written constitutions are created by the legislature elsewhere, such as the 'american Articles of Confederation' in the United States and the Austrian Hungarian Union in 1867 in Austria
 ichha na hote hue bhi kai samraaton evam raajaaon ne bhi unnisvin shatabdi main apane deshon main samvidhan rachana kii
 In France, in 1814 and 1830, and in 1848, in Sardinia, similarly the constituted constitutions were declared there
 anya samvidhan adhiktar desh kii vidhansabhaon dwaara hi bane, jaise 1787 i
 main america tathaa 1949 i
 main bharat main samvidhan kii rachana hui
 In most countries where written constitution is present, the constitution is given more recognition than other laws of the country
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki samvidhan kii utpatti hi is bhaavana se hui he ki shashanprabandh main nirankushta ko anushaasit tathaa simit rakhaa ja sake
 How much governance will be governed by the shackles of the constitution or how much will be governed by the shackles of the constitution, or how high the constitution will be considered, it depends on the purpose and attitude of the constitution makers in which subject they were willing to recognize and protect the constitution
 bhartiya samvidhan kii rachana ke samay nirmaataaon ke sammukh kai mul prashn the, jaise nagarikon ken mul swadhikaron kii suraksha, centre evam rajyon ke kaaryakshetra kii spasht vyakhya jisase donon apni nirdhaarit simaaon ke antargat hi vidhivyavahaar simit rakhen, samvidhan kaa rup paridrudh rakhana, tathaa rajyon main parsparik vaanijya vyavsaay, swatantry kii raksha ityadi
 The correctness and appropriateness of all the functions of the executive or legislature in the country depends on whether it is compatible with the constitutional objectives of the country or not, if any action is contrary to these basic objectives then that power is called external
 rajya ke sarvocch nyaayalay main jahaan vidhi prayukti evam vyakhya hoti he, adhikanshat: vahiin yah bhi nishchit hota he ki amuk vidhinium shaktibaahya he athwa nahin
 According to Hamilton, a leading author of the US Constitution, the constitution is indeed the original law and judges should always accept and accept this fact
 jab vidhanmandalon dwaara nirmit saadhaaran vidhiniyamon tathaa samvidhan main virodh upasthit ho to samvidhan ko ucch evam praathmik maanakar adhik manyata deni chahie
 The reason is that the constitution itself is an expression of the internal objectives of the people of the country while the other law symbolizes the feelings of the representatives of that people
 swabhaavat: samvidhan mul evam shreshth he
 In 1803, Chief Justice Marshall decided Margaro v
 Madison in accordance with this rule
 jahaan alikhit samvidhan hota he vahaan shashanprabandh par sanvaidhanik niyam kii abddhata avashya nahin hoti kintu janamat ke bhay se tathaa nirvachan-kriya, paramparaon evam roodhiyon dwaara is prakaar kaa niyantran evam anushaasan sahaj rup se hota rahata he
