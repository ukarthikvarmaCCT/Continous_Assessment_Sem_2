 The Palestinians, as represented by the Palestinian Authority, are fighting a protracted battle to establish an independent and sovereign nation in the Western Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip — authorized by Israel since the six-day War of 1967
 , The two-decade-long negotiations began at a time when peace negotiations failed to present a solution to the problem

 lichhavi naamak jati isa purv chhathi sadi main bihar pradesh ke uttari bhaag yani mujffarpur jile ke vaishali nagar main nivas karti thi
 Being a descendant of a great man named Lichha, he got the name Lichchhavi or he became famous by this name due to wearing some kind of mark
 lichhavi rajvansh itihasprasiddh he jiskaa rajya kisi samay main nepal, magadh or kaushal me tha
 In ancient Sanskrit literature, the name of this branch of Kshatriyas is 'nichchvi' or 'nichchivi'
 paali rup 'lichhavi' he
 According to Manusmriti, the Lichchhavis were Vratya Kshatriyas
 usamen inaki gananaa jhall, mall, nat, karan, khash or dravid ke saath kii gai he
 These 'lichchhavi' people were opposed to Vedic religion
 inaki kai shakhaayen dur dur tak faili thim
 Jain Tirthankara Mahavir Swami was in Vaishaliwali branch and Gautama Buddha was born in Shakya branch of Kosala
 kisi samay mithila se lekar magadh or koshal tak is vansh kaa rajya tha
 Just as this dynasty is said to be inferior in Sanskrit texts of Hindus, similarly in Pali and Prakrit texts of Buddhists and Jains, this dynasty is said to be high
 gautam buddha ke samasamyik magadh ke raja bimbsaar ne vaishali ke lichhavi logon ke yahan sambandh kiya tha
 The Gupta emperor also married a Lichchavi girl
 is jati kaa itihaas tathaa shashanvrittant ek sahasr varshon tak kisi na kisi rup main miltaa he
 The Lichchhavi was the principal caste of the Vajji Sangh in Pali literature, hence the name of Vajji appears in the list of Shodash Mahajanapadas in Angwasa body, Mahavastu and Vinayapitak, not Lichchavi
 sambhavat: isi kaaran panini ne vrujji sangh kaa hi ullekh kiya he
 
 kautilya ne bhi isi kii pushti kii he 
 Among the eight castes of the Vajji Sangh, Lichchavi was considered a strong and omnipotent caste, whose capital Baishali is also mentioned in the Ramayana
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar lichhavi kshatriya vanshaj the, isi kaaran mahaparinirvana ke baad lichhavi sangh ne buddha ke avshesh main hissaa bantaya tha
 They built the stupa on the relic which came to light from the excavation of Vaishali
 buddha tathaa jain dharmon kaa kshetra hone ke kaaran paalisahitya main lichhavi jati kaa vishesh varnan kiya gaya he
 It has been called an immensely powerful and well organized union
 buddha dharm kii dwitiya sangeeti bhi vaishali main hui thi
 It is said that the Lichchhavis marched on Magadha during the reign of Bimbasar
 magadh tathaa vaishali rajyon main sandhi ke falswaroop vaivaahik sambandh ho gaya parantu bimbsaar ke pashchaat is yuddh kaa badla chukaane kaa vichaar ajatshatru ne kiya
 Despite being disenchanted with the world, Buddha warned Ajatashatru that the Licchavi Sangh is invincible, impenetrable and no one can weaken its democratic organization
 buddha ke in vachanon se avgat hokar ajatshatru ne sidhaa akraman karne kaa vichaar tyaag diya or lichhavi sangh ko todane tathaa bhed utpann kar nirval banane kaa nindaneey kaary apane mantri vasskaar ko saunpa
 Finally Ajat succeeds
 vaishali par akraman karne ke nimitt ganga ke dakshin kinare par patliputra nagar kii sthapana kii, jahaan magadhasena sangathit kii gai or lichhavi sangh foot ke kaaran parajeet hua
 Being a Buddhist religious, the Lichchhavi caste supported peace and non-violence
 sambhavat: magadh samrajya ke antargat lichhavi jati prajatantr dhang par sadiyon tak shashan karti rahi
 Since the beginning of the year, the Lichchavi Sangh declared independence again in the Kushan period
 unka sanghathan prabal ho gaya or uttari bihar main vaishali rajya pramukh ho gaya
 When the Gupta dynasty emerged in the fourth century, the Gupta king became powerful because of his marital relationship with the Lichchavi dynasty
 gupt samrajya kaa pradurbhaav lichchhaviyon ke sahyog se sambhav ho sakaa tha
 This is confirmed by secret records and Swarnamudras
 gupt kaaleen swarna mudraon main "chandragupta va shri kumaar devi" ke naam se prasiddh ek swarnamudra milti he jiske agrabhag main raja tathaa rani kii akruti khudi he or "chandragupta" tathaa "shri kumaar devi" ankit he
 On the backside is a statue of Ambika seated on a lion's back
 dahini ore "lichhavay:" mudralekh padhaa gaya he
 After sufficient deliberation, it has been proved that the Gupta King i Chandragupta extracted this coin after marriage to the Lichchavi princess Kumaradevi
 is vivaah kii pushti samudragupta ke prayag stambhalekh se hoti he jahaan samudr nimna shabdon main varnit kiya gaya he : - "shri maharajaadhiraj chandraguptasya lichhavi dauhitrasy mahadevyan kumaradevyamutpannasy maharajaadhiraj shri samudraguptasya"
 This led to mutual sympathy and cooperation between the two nations
 sambhavat: samrajyavaadee kalpana ke sammukh lichhavi aadi gana rajya astitv ko bachaae na rakh sake
 With the democratization of the Indian theater, the source of renewal of political consciousness ceased to exist
 lichhavi jati uttari bihar se hatakar chhathi sadi main nepal chali gai
 He entered the secure territory of Kathmandu and established the kingdom
 kathmandu nagar kaa sthapana lichhavi raja gunakamdev nen kiya tha
 Many records of the Lichchhavi caste have been found there which attest that this caste ruled Nepal for many centuries
 inkaa shasankaal nepal ke itihaas main "swarna yug" kaha gaya he
 The Lichchhavians defeated the Thakuri Vanshi rulers in Nepal and took power under their control
 nepal ke nevaar log lichchhaviyon ke santati he
 The tradition of Lichchhavians still survives among these people
 dighanikaay ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki vajjisang main striyon kaa samaadar tathaa vriddhjanon kaa sammaan kiya jaataa tha
 Kulakumaris were not used with coercion
 sangh ke sadsy chaityon kaa maan karte, puja karte tathaa dharmik kaaryon ko samuchit rup se sampann karte the
 There was a gathering of the Lichchhaganas for the administration of the administration, with 7707 members and all were called kings
 spasht pramaanon ke abhaav main yah kahana kathin he ki sanghasabha ke sabhi sadasyon kaa nirvachan hota tha
 In Lalitavistar it is described that the Lichchhavis did not consider each other as small or big, all considered themselves kings, in this regard, the statement of the Jataka is also important that the Gana kings of Vaishali city were anointed for governance
 bhagwaan buddha ne lichhavi gana ke sambandh main kaha tha ki sabhi sadsy ekamat hokar adhiveshan main upasthit hote the
 He did not dispatch any order without making rules and acted according to the earlier rules
 bihar main sthit pracheen ganraajyon main buddhakalin samay main sabase bada tathaa shaktishaalee rajya tha
 This republic was founded by Vishal, the son of the sun-dynasty king Ishvaku, who later became known as 'vaishali'
 itvaa dharhara, munger, bihar sthit ek gaanv he
 Ukheda is a village in Pithoragarh district of Kumaon division under the state of Uttarakhand in Berinag tehsil of India
 kisi ghoomanevaali mashin ke ang ko sanbhaalane ke liye dharuk yaa bering kaa upyog hota he
 It is a mechanical device that facilitates relative motion with minimal friction between two or more parts of the machine
 dhuree yaa takale ke us bhaag ko, jo bering par rakhaa jaataa he, jarnal kaha jaataa he
 The journal rotates within the torrent and thus bears the weight of the torrent axis and the forces exerted on it and allows the axle to rotate without interruption
 saral dharuk ek nalee ke samaan hota he, jisamen dhuree ko daal diya jaataa he
 But for fast-moving axles, or where friction can cause heat to deteriorate, the torso is made into two layers which are of different types
 kisi mashin kaa dharuk aisa bhaag he jisapar mashin ke chalane se har samay bhaar rahata he or dhuree ke ghoomane ke kaaran dharuk kuch na kuch ghisata hi rahata he
 If the Dharuk is not made properly then it has to be replaced very soon
 isliye sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dharuk ko is prakaar bananaa padataa he ki vah kam se kam ghise tathaa ghise hue bhaagon ko suvidha se badla ja sake
 The Dharuk consists of two parts, one is called Bandhani, which is tightened in the machine and within this Bandhan the Dharuk is made of brass "gun" metal, or bronze
 isi prakaar kii duusari dhaatuen bhi is bhaag ke banane main kaam aati hai
 The spindle rotates within this part
 upar bataaya ja chukaa he ki yaa to dharuk ko nalee ke samaan ek bhaag main banaaya jaataa he, yaa isko do bhaagon main is prakaar banaate hai ki donon bhaag milakar nalee ke samaan ho jaaen
 The axis is between the two legs p1 and p2 of Dharuk
 dharuk kaa neeche kaa paat pa2 bandhani ke ardhgolakaar sthaan main baitha diya jaataa he
 The interpolation is placed to prevent this bridge from rotating
 is paat main dhuree ko rakhkar paat pa2 ko iske upar lagaakar topi t se argali dwaara kas diya jaataa he
 a hole is made in the upper part of the cap, giving oil or lubricant
 tel yaa snehak chhed chha main se hota hua bheetar dhuridhar main bane hue khaanchon main chalaa jaataa he or jab dhuree gumti he to snehak dhuree tathaa dharuk ke bich ek jhilli bana detaa he, jiske kaaran dhuree keval snehak kii is jhilli par hi gumti he
 Therefore, the wear of the torrent is very low and that too before the axle is fully occupied and at the time of its stop
 yadi snehak thik samay par diya jaataa rahe to dharuk bahut dinon tak chalata he
 The torrents of modern design are made differently
 kaarkaanon main, jahaan lambii dhuriyon par kai kai dharuk hote hai, dharukon ke aakalpan main iskaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki dhuree kaa sanrekhan khadi tathaa kshaitij disha main vyavasthaapi penchon se thik kiya ja sake
 The bottom of the holder of sharp and heavy axles contains an agar of oil or lubricant
 kuch dharukon main neeche ke bhaag main tel se bhare hue talp rahete hai
 These talp live between the axis and the dhruk and from the talpa a light goes through the hole into the oil well
 isi batti ke dwaara talp ko har samay tel miltaa rahata he
 There are two methods of sending oil between the torrents, by gravity or by pressure
 yah tel bheetar jaakar dhuree ke ghoomane par jo jhilli banaata he uske mahattam nipid kaa sthaan dhuree kii raftaar, bhaar or iske ghoomane kii disha par nirbhar he
 If the load is applied on the horizontal axis, which is moving in the counterclockwise direction, the center of maximum pressure will be found on the right side of the middle vertical line at an angle of 10 ° to 45 ° and this angle will be based on the value of load and speed
 kam gati or adhik bhaar ke kaaran mahattam daab kaa centre lagbhag dharuk ke pende main hoga
 The area of minimum pressure will be to the right of the vertical line at the top for this axis
 yadi dhuree ke ghoomane kii disha badal di jaae to mahattam tathaa nunatam daab ke vindu usee kone par khadi centre rekha ke bai ore honge
 For holders in which oil is entrapped, the oil should go in place of minimum pressure
 yadi mukhya bering par bhaar he to dharukon ke upree bhaag dwaara tel dene se bhi kaam chal jaataa he
 Where oil is given by pressure, it would be better to send oil from near the place of maximum pressure
 is sthaan ko usee disha main hona chahie jis ore dhuree gum rahi he
 Except for small holders, grooves are made in all other holders, due to which the oil is spread uniformly at all places
 ye khaanche tel ke nipid ke sthanon par nahin banaae jate, kyonki in sthanon par khaanche tel ko kam gharshan ke sthanon kii ore jane kaa avasar denge or tel kii jhilli thik prakaar nahin ban paaegi
 The main bearings or journals do not have grooves, but are only made in the torrents, but the grooves that move in the direction of rotation of the spindle are more profitable than the location of the oil
 thik prakaar tel die gaye dharuk kaa gharshan gunank, thr, tel ke lakshan par nirbhar he
 The effect of the metal of the torrent is above the coefficient of friction, it depends on the properties of the spindle and the formation of oil membranes and the spindle stop or lubricant
 maan len, tel kii thik jhilli ban gai he to sangharsh gunank tel, taap, gati or bhaar par aadhrut he
 The coefficient of friction is 0
005 or 0
002 for good lubricants and 0
05 or more for bad lubricants
 un sthanon par bina tel ke dharukon kaa upyog bhi hota he, jahaan yah dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki tel girane se mashin se bananevaale maal main kharabi na aa jaae, jaise kapadaa banaanevaali mashine
 If these machines have oily torrents, then the oil will fall on the cloth, which will spoil the cloth
 at: ye dharuk vividh prakaar ke hote hai
 In one stream, oil-soaked wood is applied, in the second, the part of brass is made of graphite, due to which the friction is greatly reduced
 isi prakaar or duusare dharuk bhi banaae jate hai, jinamein tel kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Some speculators think that the diameter of the journal should be kept to a minimum, taking into account the power of the spindle, which causes minimal wear
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki yadi dhuree kii gati adhik rakhni he to isapar bhaar bhi kam hi hona chahie
 But in modern assessors, it has been established that if the torrent is designed properly, then it can be put more weight along with the speed
 isse koi haani nahin hogi
 It has also been proved that reducing the length of the torch has more benefits, especially for the axis of high speed
 kam lambey dharukon main jhukaav nahin hoga
 Due to this the nipid will be equal at every place within Dharuk
 isliye dharuk kii lambaai uske vyas se kam rakhane se dhuree kii chaal bhi zyada kii ja sakati he or dhuree par bhaar bhi zyada daalaa ja saktaa he
 It should be noted that if the length of the bends is reduced more then the nipple within it will increase, which can cause a tightness in the axis and if the length is longer then the tilting in the talus can be created
 isliye dharuk kii lambaai tathaa vyas kaa anupaat aisa rakhana chahie jinase na to jhukaav kaa dar ho or na ghuri hi jakad sake
 For this reason this ratio is kept 1: 1
5 for the axle of the ship, 1
2: 2
5 for the installed engines, 2: 3 and 3: 4 for the simple heavy axle
 dharuk kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Each of them has different usage: khadi dhuree ke liye kilak dharuk banaaya jaataa he
 There is a band called "V", which is tightened in the machine
 is bandhani main pital kaa dharuk he, jisamen dhuree ko lagaaya jaataa hai
 The entire weight of the axle remains at the base of the torso
 isko ardhgolakaar banaaya jaataa he or isi bhaag main tel yaa snehak rahata he
 As a result of an examination, it has been found that if a groove is filled in the base of this torrent and oil is filled in it, then when the spindle moves, the oil moves upwards and exits through the axis
 yadi is baahar nikle hae tel ko phir se bheetar bhej diya jaae to is tel kaa upyog baar baar ho saktaa he or dharuk ke bheetar kabhi tel khatam nahin hoga
 Increasing the load on this type of axle will cause more pressure on the rivet, which may cause the torrent to fail
 isliye is prakaar ke dharuk par 15 kilogram prati varg centimetre se adhik daab nahi daali jaati
 Galpatta dharuk is used at higher pressures
 is prakaar ke dharukon kaa upyog un sthanon par hota he jahaan dhuree par adhik bhaar ho
 The brass of this torch is in two parts, in which the grooves are made according to the positions of the axles
 in khaanchon main dhuree ke padon ko baithaaya jaataa he or yah sanyukt ang bandhani main utaar diya jaataa he
 In this way, each position works differently and the axle load is divided in these positions
 in dharukon ko jal dwaara thanda rakhaa jaataa he
 If these fluids are kept properly and oil is also given at the right time, then they can tolerate more movement and pressure and can last for more days
 abhi tak jo dharuk bataae gaye hai unamem dhuree kaa tal dharuk ke tal par ghumta rahata he or sarpi gharshan ke kaaran donon kii dhaatu ghisti rahati hai
 To reduce this friction, cylinders or bullets are seated between the rotating soles
 is prakaar donon tal belanon par ghoomte hai or sarpi gharshan ke sthaan par belan gharshan kaam karata he, jiske kaaran taapan tathaa ghisaai bahut kam ho jaati he, parantu in dharukon ke ghis jane par duusare dharukon ke samaan inkaa vyavasthaapan nahin kiya ja saktaa, balki inako badalanaa hi padataa he
 These torrents are very strong and also provide more speed due to less friction
 goli gharuk bhi isi ke sadrush banaaya jaataa he
 Its tablets remain between the two arms
 antar keval yahi he ki goli dharuk main bhaar vinduon par hota he or belan dharuk main bhaar rekhaon par hota he
 Therefore, the weight should not be so high that the arms should be stacked or fabricated
 belan tathaa goli or baaju sab kathor ispaat ke bane hote hai
 All cylinders or bullets of a torrent need to be of the same size, otherwise a bullet of larger magnitude will carry more weight and the torrent will fail
 upar likhi gai baton se pataa chalegaa ki kisi dharuk ke thik kaam karne ke liye tel jaruri cheez he
 This oil forms a light membrane between the journal and the torrent, due to which the two metals cannot meet each other and the journal rotates on this membrane
 yadi kisi kaaran se dharuk main tel kam ho jaataa he to yah tel kii jhilli tut jaati he or jarnal kii dhaatu dharuk kii dhaatu se ragad khaane lagati he, jisase dharuk tathaa jarnal adhik garam ho jate hai
 This heating expands both metals and Dharuk grips the journal
 mashin kaa jarnal aisa bhaag he jisaki laagat dharuk se adhik hoti he or isaki kharaab hone se bachaaya jaataa he
 To save the same, white metal is filled in the grooves of Dharuk by making them
 jab kisi kaaran se dharuk tapakar jakadane lagati he tab yah dhaatu pighalkar jarnal or dharuk ke bich chalaa aata he or puri dhuree ruk jaati he
 Therefore, to move around with less heat and friction without a journal it is necessary to keep in mind two things: dharuk main gharshan ho to shaft kii kuch shakti dharuk main nasht hoti rahati he or upyogi kaary kii maatra kuch kam ho jaati he

 From US imperialism, nuclear weapons competition, dam construction on Narmada, Arundhati Roy has been raising her voice against many local and international issues
 But now he believes that at least in India, non-violent protests and civil disobedience movements are not being talked about

 Attempts to influence the judiciary and the media against the anti-people system have failed
 unhone kaha, "main samajhati hoon hamaare liye ye vichaar karnaa bada hi mahatvapurn he ki ham kahan sahi rahe hai or kahan galat
 hamane jo daleelein di ve sahi hai
 

 but non-violence has not worked
 " Arundhati, who has been cut short on charges of contempt of the judiciary, clearly says that she does not condemn those who took up arms
 unhone royatres ko intervyuu main kaha, "main ye kehane kii sthiti main nahin hoon ki har kisi ko hathiyaar uthaa lenaa chahie, kyonki main khud hathiyaar uthaane ko taiyaar nahin hoon

 civil ejiniyari, vyavsaayik ejineering kii ek shakha he jo ki bhautik or prakritik rup se bane parivesh main pul, sadak,naharen, band or bhawanon aadi ke dizin, nirmaan or rakrakhaav se judi he
 Civil engineering is the oldest branch of engineering after military engineering
 ise sainya ejineering se alag karne ke liye 'asainik ejineering' ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya
 Traditionally, it has been divided into several sub-branches, which include - environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, municipal or urban engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying and construction engineering
 Civil engineering takes place at every level: from the municipal sector to the federal levels in the public sector and from private house owners to international companies in the private sector
 jab se maanav astitv main aayaa he tab se ejineering uski zindagi kaa ek hissaa he
 The beginning of civil engineering correctly can be traced back to the time when 4000 and 2000 BC
 In ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia humans began to abandon the lives of Banjaras

 Other ancient historical civil engineering works include the Parthenon built by Ictinos in ancient Greece, the Appian Way built by Roman engineers, and The Great Wall of China, built by General Meng Teen at the behest of China's Emperor Shih Huang Ti
 The Romans built urban structures throughout their empire, including - canals, chambers, ports, bridges, dams, and roads
 aadhunik kaal se pehle civil abhiyantriki or vaastukala,ke bich koi spasht antar nahin tha
 There was only a geographical difference between the words of both engineer and architect in which the same person was called an engineer at some places and the architect at some places, often the same person was sometimes called an engineer or sometimes an architect
 In the 18th century, the term began to be used to distinguish military engineering from civil engineering

 Although there is some evidence which suggests that these meetings were held for consideration of technical matters, but usually this group was like a social group
 1818 main landan main institute of civil ejiniers ki sthapana hui or 1820 main prakhyat ejeeniyar thomas teleford iske pehle adhyaksh bane
 The institution received a royal manifesto in the year 1828 giving formal recognition to civil engineering
 iske ghoshnaptr ne civil abhiyantriki ko is rup main paribhaashit kiya ki The first private school to teach civil engineering in the United States was Norwich University, founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge
 1835 main renceceller politechnic institute dwaara sanyukt rajya america main civil abhiyantriki ki pehali degree di gayi
 Such a degree was given to a woman in 1905 by Cornell University to Nora Stainton Blach
 civil ejineering bhautik or vaigyanik siddhanton kaa anuprayog he or iskaa itihaas bhi bhautikee or ganit kii samaj main hone vaale vikaas ke puure itihaas se judaa he
 Because civil engineering is a wide-ranging business that includes many different and specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge in many fields such as structures, materials science, geography, soil and hydrology, environment, mechanics and more

 This degree usually requires four or five years of study
 is degree ko puraa karne ke baad saamanytah aapako par ek ejineering main snaatak, karnaa kaha jaataa he, haalanki kuch vishvavidhyalayon main ise vigyaan main snaatak karnaa kaha jaataa he is degree main aam taur par bhautik vigyaan, ganit, pariyojna prabandhan, dijaining or civil ejineering ke kuch vishisht vishay shaamil hote hai
 Initially, such subjects try to tell more and more subjects and if it is not possible to give complete information about that subject, then they tell about the subdivisions of civil engineering after the degree is completed
 Students can choose one or more subdivisions to do a special study in
 adhikansh deshon main, ejineering main snaatak kii degree ek peshewar pramanikaran kii disha main pehla kadam hota he or iskaa degree program swayan ek peshewar sanstha dwaara pramanit hota he
 After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must be qualified to obtain this degree before obtaining this certified degree
 Once certified, the engineer is given the title of Professional Engineer in which they are called Chartered or Authorized Engineers
 As a branch it covers hydrology, environmental science, meteorology, geology, conservation and resource management
 civil ejineering kaa yah kshetra bhumigat or dharti ke upar vaale sansadhano kii gunvattta or maatra donon kii bhavishyavaanee or prabandhan se juda hua he
 Water resources engineers make a model from the very small part of the land and analyze it so that they can estimate it by the flow of water
 However, the actual design of the facility can also be assigned to another engineer

 Structural engineering is concerned with structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers, tunnels
 saath hi saath yah samudragami ilaakon main bani sanrachanaayen evam or anya sanrachanaon se sambandhit he
 It identifies the forces exerted on the structure and the pressures and stresses caused by these forces within that structure and then constructs the structure so that it can successfully lift and bear those forces
 Other dead force, living force, dynamic force, wind force, earthquake force, may be equal to the force generated by temperature change

 kuch bhaaran sthitiyon ki prakruti ke kaaran sanrachanaatmak ejineering ke bheetar kii up-shakhaaen viksit ho jaati hai, jisamen vaayu ejineering or bukamp ejineering shaamil hai
 The byproduct of the design includes the strength, rigidity and stability of the structure when carried for loads that may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, earthquake, congestion or vehicles
 Load, or temp such as temp, build load or impact
 Other considerations include cost, ability to manufacture, safety, aesthetics and stability

 According to the texts of all Buddhist schools, the first Buddhist council was held soon after Buddha's death, most recently dated by a majority of scholars around 400 BCE, headed by the monk Mahakasapa under the patronage of King Ajatashatru , At Sattapanni Cave Rajagraha

 a steam turbine is a mechanical device that extracts heat energy from pressurized steam and converts it into mechanical work
 aadhunik rup main iskaa avishkaar sar charles parcens ne 1884 main kiya tha
 a steam turbine is a conductor, in which the high-speed steam is driven into a rotor by converting the heat energy of the steam into kinetic energy, and colliding on a number of panels that rotate and operate
 anyonyagtik bhaap ingine main bhaap kii sthitik daab dwaara piston par kaary kiya jaataa he
 Although the steam in the engine moves with the piston, the effect of the kinetic energy of steam in the action of the engine is negligible
 bhaap tarabine main bhaap ingine kii apeksha ucchtar gati mil sakati he or gatisima bhi badi ha sakati he
 Turbine parts have good balance
 bhaap kii samaan maatra evam samaan avasthaa main bhaap tarabine bhaap ingine se adhik shakti paidaa kar saktaa he
 Steam consumption increases after a few years of working with a steam engine, but the turbine does not have such a state
 The steam turbine is the most durable of all the original drivers on earth
 tarabine se sabase bada laabh yah hota he ki isse ghurnak gati sidhe praapt hoti he, jabaki bhaap ingine main anyonyagati se ghurnak gati praapt karne ke liye alag se upadan kaa vyavahar karnaa padataa he
 In a vaporizer, steam is produced at high pressure and temperature
 jab yah bhaap tarabine ke paas pahunchati he, us samay isamen adhik maatra main ushma urja hoti he or isaki daab bhi itani adhik hoti he ki yah nimnadaab tak prasaarit ho sakati he
 But at that time its kinetic energy is negligible
 at: bhaap kuch kaary kar sake iske pehle isaki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 This change occurs in the well-designed device, expanding the steam
 bhaap kaa prasar yaa to ek hi kriya main purna kiya jaataa he, yaa vibhinn kriyaaon main
 This means that many stationary devices are put into practice to convert heat energy into kinetic energy and often a moving device is placed between two stationary devices
 sthir upkaran main praapt gatij urja ko uske baad bandhe hue gatiman upkaran ke upar kaary karne ke liye lagaaya jaataa he
 The world's first rotating engine was built in 50 AD by the Hero of Alexandria
 isamen do kilkon ke bich ek khokhli gend lagi thi
 At the bottom of the turbine, a vessel was placed to make steam, so that steam could enter the ball
 vahaan se bhaap gend main lagi hui do traigy nalikaaon dwaara baahar aati thi isi ke kaaran gend gumti rahati thi
 This turbine was very simple
 hero ke tarabine ke aadhaar par bahut se vaigyanikon ne iske vikaas ke liye anveshan kiye
 Since then turbines of various designs have been made, but they have all remained as samples
 un tarabinon ko vyavhaar main laana laabhadaayak nahin samajha gaya
 The first successful turbine was built by Giovanni Vranka in 1629 AD
 yah pehla aaveg tarabine tha
 Steam turbines are mainly of two types: is tarabine main sirf tund main bhaap prasaarit hoti he
 There is no change in the pressure of steam in passing through the moving planes, that is, the pressure of steam on the entrance and exit ends of the panels remains the same
 bhaap, gatiman falkon kii kai panktiyon se hokar, pravaahit hoti he or is pravaah main gatij urja kaa parivartan upyogi kaary ke rup main hota he
 The first successful turbine of such turbines was the de Labal's turbine, an impulse cycle over which steam escapes from the perpendiculars on the perimeter
 bhaap tund main purnat: vistaarit hoti he
 They tilt from the tangent of the Tunda Chakra at an angle from 150 to 200
 sabase chota di lavaal tarabine 5 inch vyas vaale chakra kaa banaaya gaya tha or yah 30,000 parikraman prati minute par chalaaya gaya tha
 It is suitable for low pressure steam
 is tarah ke tarabine ke falkon ke pravesh evam nikaas kone samaan hote hai
 In this type of turbine, steam is not fully dispersed in one action
 pratham sthir pankti se nikalakar bhaap gatiman falak par takaraati he
 As the steam flows through the panels, it propagates
 at: is tarah ke tarabine main falak tund kaa bhi kaam karata he
 There is some increase in the kinetic energy of steam when steam is transmitted by moving panels
 is tarah iske falak kaary karne ke saath hi saath bhaap kaa prasar bhi karte hai
 These panels simultaneously face induced and reaction forces
 isi liye is tarah ke tarabine ko 'aaveg pratikraya tarabine' kehete hai
 In fact, this nomenclature is inaccurate, as there is no single turbine called pure reaction turbine
 is tarah ke tarabine ke do mukhya udhaaharan hai:- Parson built the first impulse response turbine in 1884 AD
 isamen bhaap, tarabine chakra ke aksh ke samanaantar disha main falkon se hokar, pravaahit hoti he
 This type of turbine is also called an axis turbine
 parson tarabine main sthit or gatiman falak sarvasam banaae jate hai
 In this turbine, the vane rests in a radius direction, from which steam enters the end of the vane near the axis of the wheel and flows towards the periphery
 iske kaaran is tarabine main pravaah traigy hota he
 Apart from this, an important difference is that both types of panels move in opposite directions, which gives higher relative velocity
 saadhaarant: bhaap tarabine main agralikhit purje lage rahete hai: The most prominent in the steam turbine is its vane
 is yantra ke anya purje inhen falkon ke upyog ke liye rahete hai
 Power cannot be attained without a plank and the efficiency of the turbine is reduced due to a slight defect in the panels
 iske nirmaan ke liye aise dravyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo ucchataap ke saath hi ucch pratibal kaa bhi saamana kar saken
 Non-ferrous class liquids cannot be used for the panels of modern high-temperature and high-stress turbines, as their stress capacity also decreases with heat
 aajkal iske liye avikari ispaat ke vikaas kii ore vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan kendrit he
 The ideal face is the one that is equally balanced while being of the highest efficiency
 is tarah kii avasthaa khokhale falkon dwaara praapt kii ja sakati he
 Except this, the hollow panels do not put strong stress on the cruisers
 isse ucch gati kii prapti hoti he, tathaa adhik shakti kii prapti ho sakati he
 In turbines, prone panels are also treated, leaving less stress on it
 sabhi bhaap tarabinon main falakgati bhapagati kii anupaati hoti he
 If steam is transmitted in a single step from vapor pressure to condensing pressure, the steam will become excessive at the end of the propagation
 yadi is ucch gati bhaap kaa ek phalkapankti main vyavhaar kiya jaay, to isse paribhramak gati atyadhik milegi, jo vyaavhaarik kaaryon ke liye atyant adhik he
 Many systems have been discovered to reduce this high speed of cruisers
 in sabhi pranaaliyon main kai phalkapanktiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For this, many cruisers are bound with the help of a key
 jaise jaise gatiman phalkapanktiyon dwaara bhaap pravaahit hoti he, bhaapadaab un charnon main avashoshit ho jaati he
 This action is called 'combination'
 paribhramak gati ko kam karne ke mukhya tareeke ye hai: Separated by rows of stationary faces, the rows of moving faces remain turbine
 bhaap, vaashpitra daab se sanghanak daab tak tonti main prasaarit hokar, ucch gati praapt karti he
 The high-speed-steam then flows through the first line of moving panes, in which some of its momentum is absorbed and the rest enters the next line of stationary faces
 ye sthir falak gati ko bina parivartit kiye bhaap kii disha ko badal dete hai
 The steam then enters the second line of the moving pane
 bhaap kii gati kaa kuch or bhaag is duusari gatiman pankti main avashoshit hota he
 As the steam flows through the forward pane, the sequence keeps repeating
 is tarah ant main bhaap kii sampurna gatij urja avashoshit ho jaati he
 It consists of rows of moving panes, each followed by a row of stationary spout, in order that the turbine is held by the key on the wheel
 isamen bhaap kaa purna daabpaat cabel tonti kii pratham pankti main hi nahin hota, balki tonti kii sabhi panktiyon main samaan rup se banta rahata he
 The steam from the evaporator enters the first line of the spout, in which it is partially circulated
 tatpashchaat yah pratham gatiman phalkapankti dwaara pravaahit hoti he, jahaan isaki praaia: sampurna gatij urja avashoshit ho jaati he
 From this line, it enters the second line of the spout, where it is re-circulated partially
 isse daab main phir kuch kami ho jaati he
 The kinetic energy received by the second line of the tot is absorbed in the next moving pane
 yah kriya tab tak chalati rahati he, jab tak sampurna daabpaat tarabine main avashoshit na ho jaae
 This method of pressure combination is applied in the Rattue and Joylei turbines
 is tarah ke tarabine main uparyukt donon tareekon kaa upyog hota he
 The absolute pressure of the steam is divided into all phases and the momentum obtained in each phase is also combined
 isse yah laabh hota he ki prayek charnaa main ucch daabpaat kii prapti hoti he, jiske falswaroop kam charnon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 That is why the size of such turbine is small
 curtis tarabine isi tarah kaa he
 Different motions of steam at the entry and exit ends of the moving pane of the turbine are represented by a velocity diagram
 ek adarsh tarabine main bhaap dwaara kiya gaya kaary rankin kaary ke baraabar hota he, arthath yah ruddhoshm ushmapat ke tulya hoga
 This work is greatly reduced by many losses in practice
 pratham haani veganiyantrak valve main hoti he, jahaan bhaap kii daab avrodh dwaara 5 se lekar 10 pratishat tak kam ho jaati he
 In high-pressure spout, there is a slight decrease in steam pressure through friction and whirlpool, but the most damage occurs in the bottleneck
 ushmiya dakshata ke liye chote chote falak upyukt nahin hote, kintu yadi falak kii oonchaai badhaai jaae to ucchdaab bhaap, bhaap kii adhik ghatna or parimit maatra ke kaaran, pratham charan kii sampurna paridhi ko dhak nahin paati he, jisase aanshik praveshhani hoti he
 The result is that the vane which is not under the influence of the steam jet keeps churning the steam filled in the casing
 iske karan pankhaa yaa vaati haani hoti he
 The percolator of the high pressure turbine also operates in a dense medium, in which it has to withstand extremely fluid barriers and this causes flash-friction-loss
 tarabine main vibhinn charnon dwaara pravaahit bhaap kii in haniyon kaa hameshaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 As the density of steam decreases, these losses also decrease
 inke alaava vikiran haani to hoti hi he
 There are also losses through friction in the bearings
 tarabine main kaary karne ke baad bhaap sanghanak main pravesh karti he evam is samay bhi isamen kuch veg hota he
 The loss of this kinetic energy is called the final or residual loss
 tarabine sanyantr kii dakshata ko badhaane ke liye is pranali kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 In this, steam A, b and c are taken out of the turbine from three points and sent to three heaters
 antim taapak se nikalakar bhaap ardravastha main jalashay main pravesh karti he, jahaan se hokar bharnajal pravaahit hota he
 Since the fill water is colder than steam, it is heated by taking heat from steam itself
 bharnajal ek taapak se duusare main, phir duusare se tisare main jaataa he
 The discharge water from the final heater becomes extremely hot, which saves heat in the evaporator
 iske kaaran tarabine sanyantr kii dakshata bad jaati he
 When circulating in the turbine, the steam becomes humid after the first few steps
 ardra bhaap main rahanevaale jalakan falkon par aghat karte hai, jisase falak kii aayu kam ho jaati he
 Therefore, steam is removed from the turbine as soon as it is humid to remove vane corrosion, reduce steam friction losses and increase the thermal capacity of the turbine
 iske baad yah pun:taapak main pravesh karti he, jahaan yah phir se taap prahan karke adhitpt ho jaati he or tab yah tarabine ke agle charan main laut jaati he
 According to the steam design for reheating, the turbine is taken out from one or more locations
 ye nimnlikhit hai - Along with power in many industries, there is also demand for heat, which is necessary for legislative work
 chunki 300 pound prati varg inch par santrupt bhaap kii purna ushma 30 pound prati varg inch par kii purna ushma se chaar pratishat hi adhik hoti he, at: ucchdaab kii bhaap kaa janan ushmagatiki ke anusaar adhik laabhprad hoga
 In the extraction turbine, this steam is first circulated to work and according to the demand some amount of steam is pumped out for the work at low pressure
 shesh bachi bhaag ko tarabine main sanghanak daab tak prasaarit kiya jaataa he
 This type of turbine is called extraction turbine and this turbine has two parts, the high pressure part and the low pressure part
 yah tarabine nishkarshan tarabine kaa hi ek rup he
 In this, the entire steam is taken out for legislative work
 isse bhaap sirf ucchdaab bhaag main hi prasaarit hoti he
 Low pressure turbine is the turbine in which steam enters the low pressure to work and is transmitted to the lowest pressure
 yadi nimnadaab bhaap lagaataar milti rahe to ek nimnadaab tarabine kaa prayog karke samooche sanyantr kii kshamta badhaai ja sakati he
 According to the theory of thermodynamics, low pressure turbines operating at the same pressure range provide more work than low pressure engines
 yadi bhaap kaa pradaay lagaataar na ho to ushmasanchayak kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The capacity of the calorimeter indicated above is also limited
 jab nimnadaab bhaap kii maatra maang se bahut kam ho jaati he, tab is kami ko puraa karne ke liye vaashpitra se bhaap kii daab ko kam karke tarabine main bheja jaataa he
 In this way, two supplies of steam coming at high pressure and low pressure fall into the same turbine
 is tarah ke tarabine ko mishritdaab tarabine kehete hai
 In this turbine, the steam pressure exhaust, or thermometer, is treated

 Emperor Mihir Bhoja did not want the Arabs to be safe even in these two places and to cause further trouble, so he sent a large army expedition and conquered the place called Imhfuz of Imran bin Musa, the western borders of the Gurjara Pratihara Empire, hundreds of miles from the Sind River
 Reached the west and thus, India was protected from the barbaric, fanatic and tyrannical attacks of the Arabs for the next centuries

 When the Arab armies advanced under the leadership of the commander Mohammad Junaid to make the whole of India a Muslim nation, after conquering the Sindh province and converting it into a Muslim nation, he needed to win the Gujjar territory from Sindh
 isliye unhone bhayanak akraman prarambh kiye
 On one side there were Islamic soldiers from Arabia, Syria and Iraq etc
, whose aim was to establish Islamic rule all over the world and on the other side Gurjars, symbol of great Arya-religion and culture! Coming into battle with the declaration of 'allah Hoon Akbar', the Arabic fanatic warrior, Mihir Bhoja's army was ready to compete with Jai Mahadev Jai Gurjeshwar, Jai Mahakal's challenge

 Bikaner's old name was "jangळ Pradesh", and "vikramakhand", "vikram Nagar" or "vikrampuri"! Its founder was Rao Bikaji - who was born on 5 August 1438 AD in Jodhpur
 His father's name was Rao Jodha and mother Rani Naurangade! Bikaji was married to "rangakanwar", daughter of Rao Shekha Bhati of Pugal, in the presence of Karani Mata! It is said- Rao Bika, son of the founder of Jodhpur, Rao Jodha, separated from his father and traveled north east from Jodhpur to establish a new kingdom with his trusted 5 chieftains and many with the blessings of his Kuldevi 'karani Mata' In 1456, the foundation of the Rathore dynasty was established in this ancient region called 'jangal' by conquering local Jats and tribes from big and small places
 bikaner kii sthapana ke peeche do kahaniyaan sunne main aati hai
 Firstly, Napa Sankhala, who was Bikaji's maternal uncle, told Jodhaji - "even though you have made Santaji the successor of Jodhpur, but give Bikaji some soldiers and a strap of sarunda
 vah vir he tathaa bhagya kaa dhani bhi, vah aapke ashish se apane boote khud apana nayaa rajya sthapit kar legaa
 'jodhaji accepted Napa's advice and gave Sarunda strap to Napaji along with a contingent of 500 soldiers
 shoorveer bikaaji ne pita kaa yah faisla prasantaapurvak maan liya
 At that time, Kandhalji, Rupa ji, Mandal ji, Nathu ji and Nanda ji - In addition to these five chieftains, Napa Sankhla, Bella Padihar, Lala Lakhan Singh Baid, Chauthmal Kothari, Nahar Singh Bachhawat, Vikram Singh Purohit, Saluji Rathi, etc
 Bikaji Supported with in sab saradaaron ke saath bikaaji ne bikaner kii sthapana kii
 Salu ji Rathi was a resident of Osian village of Jodhpur
 ve apane saath apane aradhyadev marunayak yaa moolnaayak kii murti bhi saath laaye the jiske sammaan main aaj bhi unke vanshaj ‘saale kii holi’ mohalle main holikaa-dahan karte he
 The real meaning of the brother-in-law should not be taken as the brother of the sister, but rather as a distortion of Salu ji! bikaner kii sthapana ke peeche duusari ek lokapriy janashruti ye he ki ek din jodhpur naresh raav jodha darbar main baithe the to bikaaji kuch der se aaye tathaa pranaam kar apane chachaa kanthal se kaanaafoosee karne lage| yah dekh kar raav jodha ne vyangy main kaha “ maaloom hota he ki donon chachaa-bhatija kisi nae rajya kii sthapana kii yojana bana rahe hai
 "on this, Becca and Kanthal said that" If you are pleased, sir, this will happen soon "and along with this, both uncle and nephew got up from the court
 inhen donon ne mil kar nae bikaner rajya kii sthapana kii
 Thus, Bikaner was established with the response of a taunt
 Although this area was not even uninhabited, there were 2 villages of Jats settling in this area
 asoj sudi 10, samvath 1522, san 1465 ko bikaaji ne jodhpur se kooch kiya tathaa pehle mandor pahunche ! raav bika ne das varsh tak bhaatiyon kaa muqabla kiya magar vijay hasil na dekh samvath 1442 main vartmaan bikaner aa gayi! unheen ne 1488 i
main bikaner nagar kii sthapana kar use apni rajdhani banaaya
 Bikaji laid the foundation stone of the first fort of Bikaner in Vikram Samvat 1542, near the present Lakshminath temple, whose entry festival Samvat 1545, Vaishakh Sudi 2, was celebrated on Saturday! Even today the remains of this fort can be seen
 a folk-doha in this regard is popular - rajya kaa dur-dur tak vistaar karne vaale raav bika kii nidhan-tithi itihaas kii kitabon main asoj sudi tritiya samvath 1561, san 1504 ankit he ! Coordinates: 25 ° 27′N 81 ° 51′E / 25

 This victory over Pakistan was historic in many ways
 bharat ne 93 hajaar pakistani sainikon ko ghutane techne par majaboor kar diya tha
 Prior to 1971, Bangladesh was a province of Pakistan called 'east Pakistan' whereas present day Pakistan was called West Pakistan
 kai saalon ke sangharsh or pakistan kii sena ke atyaachaar or banglabhashiyon ke daman ke virodh main purvi pakistan ke log sadakon par utar aae the
 To crush the freedom movement in 1971, the Pakistani army strongly oppressed the people, intent on the revolt of East Pakistan
 lakhon logon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya or anginat mahilaon kii aabru lut lee gai
 India, as a neighbor, opposed this oppression and helped the revolutionaries

 On 14 August 1947, an independent Pakistan based on religion was formed, there were two parts of erstwhile Pakistan; East and West Pakistan and both parts did not have social, economic and educational similarities
 According to the resources, East Pakistan was more prosperous but politically West Pakistan was more intense and dominating

 1971 ke samay pakistan main general yahya khan raashtrapati the or unhone purvi hisse main faili naaraazgi ko dur karne ke liye general tikka khan ko jimmedaari di
 But efforts were made by him to resolve the matter under pressure which worsened the situation completely

 Science fiction is the genre of fictional literature that gives narrative expression to the human reaction arising out of possible changes in science and technology
 meri shelli kii 'da francanstein' pehali vigyaan kathatmak kriti maani jaati he
 In the past century in America and Britain, there have been better science fiction stories - Isaac Azimov, Arthur C
 Clarke, Robert Heinlein have been famous science fiction writers
 ab teenon divangat hai
 When Devaki Nandan Khatri, the father of Aiyari and Tilasmi novels in Hindi, appeared in Hindi along with Chandrakanta, it was usually during that period that Ambika Dutt Vyas's wonder wonder-story also created a new array of science fiction writing in Hindi
 ‘piyus pravaah’ patrika main 1884-88 ke madhya dharawahik rup se iskaa prakaashan ho chukaa tha
 The 'wonder story' was purely a science fiction, completely free from mischievous and espionage influences
 udhar bangla bhashaa main "panch kaudi de" jab jasusi sahitya- ‘ghatana-ghatatope’, ‘jai-paraajay’, ‘jivan rahasy’, ‘nil vasana sundari’, ‘mayavi’, ‘-ke nirmaan main pravrutt the to usee kaal main vigyaan kathaayen bhi likhi ja rahi thi, balki kahana yah chahie ki bangala main vigyaan galp kaa unmesh isse purv ho chukaa tha
 Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, an analyst of life in plants and inventor of wireless, wrote the first Bengali science fiction titled 'storm over Victory' in 1897 itself
 anadidhan binraji ne ‘van kusum’, ‘champa phool’, ‘chor’ jaise upanyaason ke saath saath ‘mangal grah’ jaisaa vigyaan galp bhi prastut kiya
 In Marathi, Sridhar Balakrishna Ranade wrote the first science fiction titled 'tareche Humor' in 1915
 praayah isi samay nath madhav ne ‘shrinivas raav’ naamak vaigyanik upanyaas marathi main prastut kiya
 The Hindu readership of Devaki Nandan Khatri created in the backdrop of the Aranyas of Mirzapur, the Hindi readers were astonished and bemused and he took Khatri ji hands
 khanni pranit ‘narendramohini’ ‘virendra vir’, ‘chandrakanta santati’, ‘kusum kumari’, ‘naulakha haar’, ‘guptagodana’ 
 ‘kaagaj kii kothri’ ‘anuthi begum’, ‘bhootnath’ ne lokapriyata kii sari hadein paar kar leen
 The magic of Indrajal of Devaki Nandan Khatri started to speak on the head of the readers
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne ‘hindi sahitya kaa itihaas’ main likhaa he ki khatri ke tilsmi sahitya kaa anand lene ke liye urdubhashiyon ne hindi sikhi
 It was like Khatri's dark world! pathak hi kya, samakaleen lekhak bhi is jaadu ke mohpash main aabaddh hue bina na rah sake
 Then meaningful efforts to create Tilasmi literature started and such things started coming out in a surprising amount and the Hindi readers got wet in it
 is kaal khand main aise lekhakon kii samrudh parampara dikhaai padati he
 Devi Prasad Upadhyay's 'maya-vilas', Jagannath Chaturvedi's 'vasant-malati', Hare Krishna Johar's 'kusum Lata', 'terrible Love', Saraswati Gupta's 'rajkumar', Bal Mukunda Varma's 'kamini', Rajendra Mohini , Hare Krishna Johar Kriti 'vampire', 'manayak-mohini', 'magician' and 'kamal Kumari', Madan Mohan Pathak Kriti 'anand Sundari', Munni Lal Khanni Krita Bahadur ', Hare Krishna Johar Krita' Nirala Masked 'and' terrible blood ', that Rori Lal Goswami wrote 'two-piece of cut mud', Vishweshwar Prasad Varma, 'virendra Kumar', Kishori Lal Goswami, 'yakuti Takhti', Ram Lal Varma's 'putlimahal', Roop Kishore Jain's 'surya Kumar Sambhav' Etc
 are representative works of this literature
 aage bhi yah parampara chalati rahi lekin yaheen se tilsmi sahitya kaa praayah avsaan mana janaa chahie
 It is also a strange coincidence that along with Tilasmi literature, there was a sudden flood of espionage and readers were appreciated and adopted
 hindi main jasusi upanyaason ke prenta gopal ram gahamri hai
 After a brief period of 'chandrakanta' and 'narendra Mohini' of Devaki Nandan Khatri, 'awesome Corpse' and 'detective' also emerged together
 in jasusi upanyaason kii badhati lokapriyata se prerit hokar gahamri ne prabhoot maatra main aisa sahitya rachaa-‘bekasoor kii faansee’, ‘sarakati laash’, ‘khooni koun he ?’, ‘begunaah kaa khun’, ‘jamuna kaa khun’, ‘dabl jasoos’, ‘mayavini’, ‘jaaduugarani manorama’ 1901), ‘ladki chori’, ‘jasoos kii bhul’, ‘thana kii chori’, bhanyakar chori’, ‘andhe kii aankh’, ‘jaal raja’, ‘jaali kaaka’, ‘jasoos kii chori,, ‘malgodaam main chori’, ‘daake par daaka’, ‘doctor kii kahani’, ‘ghar kaa bhedi’, ‘jasoos par jasoos’, ‘devi singh’ 
 ‘ladkaa gaayab’, ‘jasoos chakkar main ’, ‘khooni kaa bhed’, ‘bhojpur kii thangi’ 
 ‘balihaari buddhi’, ‘yoga mahima’ or ‘guptbhed’ aadi
 Even contemporary Hindi writers could not keep themselves afloat due to the influence of detective literature, and many such compositions came out during this period
 yatha-rudradutt sharma krit ‘var singh daaroga’, ‘kishori laal goswami krit ‘jinde kii laash’, ‘jairam gupt krit ‘langadaa khooni’, jang bahadur singh krit ‘vicitra khun’ sher singh krit ‘vilakshan jasoos’, ‘chandrashekhar pathak krit ‘amir ali thang’, ‘shashi bala’ or shiv narayan dvivedi krit ‘amar dutt’ aadi
 But this tradition ends here
 kaaran yah ki hindi main yah parampara naveen thi or angl sahitya se purnatah prabhavit
 The reader quickly got bored of it due to not conforming to the Indian environment
 pathakon kii aruchi ne tilsmi, aiyaari or jasusi sahitya kaa achir main hi garbhalopan bhi kar diya
 With the landing of Premchand, the screen was completely transformed
 1917-18 ke aas-paas tilsmi or jasusi sahitya nepathy main chale gayi
 In the thirties of the twentieth century, psychological and phenomenal novels knocked
 pathakvarg nayepan kii talash main tha
 He wanted to get rid of formulaic literature
 aise main kishori laal goswami ke ‘gupt godana’ ne sanjivani kaa kaam kiya

 While Vishwambhar Nath Sharma presented a cosmic novel called 'turk Taruni', Bhagwati Charan Verma made Wajid Ali Shah's luxury in 'fall' the basis of his narrative
 rishabhcharan kaa ‘gadar’ hindi upanyaason main ek nayi karavat kaa pratik he
 Vrindavanlal Varma carried this tradition forward
 unhone ‘virata kii padmini’ or ‘gadhn kundar’ jaise aitihaasik upanyaason ke srijan ke liye bundelkhand ke bhukhando, samskruti or vahaan ke veeron ke paraspar vaimnasy, prem-prasangon ko apana aadhaar banaaya
 The 'cane' of Krishna Nand Gupta is also a creation of this category
 bhagwati charan verma ne ‘chitralekha’ main paap or punya kii vishad vyakhya kii
 Premchand's 'durgadas' and Chatur Sen Shastri's 'rana Raj Singh' made aiyari-tilasmi-espionage literature a contradiction, and this tradition ended there
 hindi kii vigyaan kathaon ke bare main likhte samay log praayah keshav prasad singh kii ‘chandralok kii yatra’ kaa pratham vigyaan galp ke rup main ullekh karte hai
 So far there is such a view
 kadaachit iskaa kaaran pan shrinarayan chaturvedi kii vah tippanee he jo unhone ‘saraswati’ patrika ke 60 varsh puure hone ke uplakshya main prakashit ‘hirak jayanti visheshank’ ke kahani khand ke aarambh main di thi
 In Part 1, Number 6, 'saraswati', for the first time, two stories were published simultaneously
 kishori laal goswami kii ‘indumati’ or keshav prasad singh kii ‘chadralok kii yatra’
 Chaturvedi ji comments on these - the second story seems to be written based on an English story
 vah lambii he or dharawahik rup se prakashit hui thi
 'indumati' is the first story of modern style in Hindi, not only in Saraswati
 ’ He made 'chandralok's journey' unimportant by calling it anglo-based, but declared 'indumati' as the first Hindi story
 ‘isse pahile ‘harishchandra chandrika’ or ‘piyush praavah’ main ek-do kahaniyaan chhapi thim
 Stories before Pandit Ambika Dutt Vyas's 'surprise-history' and Pandit Bal Krishna Bhatt's 'nutan Brahmachari' had probably been published before this
 kintu ‘indumati’ ko hi hindi kii pahili aadhunik kahani hone kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 ' sambhawatah kahkar unhone apni baat samaapt kar di lekin yadi isaki padtaal karne kii cheshtaa hi gai hoti to yah vibhram samaapt ho gaya hota ki pratham hindi vigyaan galp koun-sa he ? yadhyapi hindi main yah vimarsh aaj bhi jari he ki hindi kii pehali aadhunik kahani koun si he
 


 'indumati'? Insha Alla Khan's 1803 story of Rani Ketki? Or Pandit Gauri Dutt Praneet 'deorani Jethani Ka Kahani', published in 1870, which is actually a short social novel
 is vimarsh main pratibhaag karne kaa yahaan na to mujhe avkaash he or na hi yah charchaa praasangik hi he

 hindi shabd kaa sambandh sanskrit shabd sindhu se mana jaataa he
 'sindhu' used to call Sindh river and on that basis, the land around it started to be called Sindhu
 yah sindhu shabd irani main jaakar ‘hindu’, hindi or phir ‘hind’ ho gaya
 Later, Iranians gradually became familiar with more parts of India and the meaning of this word expanded and the word Hind became the sign of the whole of India
 isi main irani kaa ic pratyay lagane se ‘hindik’ bana jiskaa arth he ‘hind kaa’
 The Greek word 'indika' or the English word 'india' etc

 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, in his article titled "advaita of Hindi and Urdu", while considering the etymology of Hindi, said that the 'S' sound was not spoken in Iran's ancient language Avesta

 For example, the word 'asura' in Sanskrit was called 'ahur' there

 These 'native' words were popular words of the public language, which had also come into nature by nature
