 Other tourist attractions in Meghalaya are as follows: lok sahitya kaa abhipraay us sahitya se he jisaki rachana lok karata he
 Folk literature is as ancient as human, so it contains every stage of public life, every class, every time and nature
 dow satyendra ke anusaar- "lok manushya samaaj kaa vah varg he jo abhijatya sanskaar shastreeyta or paanditya kii chetana athwa ahankaar se shunya he or jo ek parampara ke pravaah main jivit rahata he
 " saadhaaran janata se sambandhit sahitya ko loksahitya kahana chahie
 Ordinary life is different from typical life, so the ideal of public literacy is different from specific literature
 kisi desh athwa kshetra kaa loksahitya vahaan kii adikaal se lekar ab tak kii un sabhi pravritiyon kaa pratik hota he jo saadhaaran janaswabhaav ke antargat aati hai
 In this literature, all kinds of feelings of life are encountered without any artificiality
 at: yadi kahin kii samoochee samskruti kaa adhyayan karnaa ho to vahaan ke loksahitya kaa vishesh avlokan karnaa padegaa
 It is less written and more verbal
 vaise hindi loksahitya ko lipibaddh karne kaa prayaas idhar kuch varshon se kiya ja rahaa he or anek granth bhi sampadit rup main saamne aae hai kintu ab bhi maukhik loksahitya bahut badi maatra main asangruhit he
 The depiction of the simplest, naturalistic expression of folk life is found in folklore and folklore, it is rare elsewhere
 lok-sahitya main lok-maanav kaa hriday bolta he
 Nature itself sings and chants
 lok-sahitya main nihit saundarya kaa moolyankan sarvatha anubhutijnya he
 From time to time, there are some special principles of folklore that survive with the help of Shruti and Smriti
 is sahitya main mukhya rup se ve rachanaayen hi sweekaar kii jaati hai athwa jivan paati hai jo anek kanthon se anek roopon main ban bigadakar ek sarvamaanya rup dhaaran kar leti hai
 This sequence has continued since time immemorial
 aisi bahut si sahityak saamagree aaj bhi prachlit he jo abhi ekarupata nahin grahan kar pai hai
 Due to traditional and collective talent, scholars have termed folk literature as "apaurusheya"
 nishchay hi paramparaagat loksahitya kisi ek vyakti kii rachana kaa parinaam nahin he
 Although many proofs can be given that the form of the same song, story or proverb as it happens at one place changes its form by reaching the other place, but a good proof would be that folklore sung for hundreds of years
 Alh-khand could not achieve uniformity till date
 is kaary main lokpravriti kisi pratibandh ko sweekaar hi nahin karti
 In Sphut songs, only the lines are moving here and there, but in the management songs and stories, the incidents also change
 yah sab hote hue bhi un prabandhon evam kathaon ke parinaamon main praaia: koi parivartan nahin sweekaar kiya jaataa
 The result and the prevailing truth and facts are taken as the basis of the event cycle arbitrarily
 ramakatha ko hi len
 The matter of "nana like Rama Avatara, Ramayan Sat Koti Apara" is 100 percent true
 ramakatha sambandhi jitani vividhtaayen loksahitya main prachlit hai yadi un sab ko ekatra kiya jaae to yah vicitra prakaar kaa "lokaramayana" granth taiyaar hoga jo abtak ke sabhi ramakhyanon se bhinn astitv kaa hoga
 Seeing the events of the cycle, sometimes it will be difficult to establish their association
 udhaahranswaroop lokgeeton main bhi ramajanm ke kai kaaran hai kintu ek bahut hi saadhaaran kaaran yah he ki ek baar jab maharaj dasharath praat: kaal sarayu main snaan karne ja rahe the to unka darshan savere hi gali main jhaadoo denevaali helin ko ho gaya
 He taunted that today, a visionless person appeared in the morning, i do not know how the day will pass
 dasharath ko yah baat lag gai or tabhi ve rani samet putraprapti ke liye van main tap karne chale gaye
 Thus, while showing the second reason, the folklorist then brings Dasaratha to a place of penance where the story mixes with the story of other Ramayana
 aise anek udhaaharan mil sakate hai jo parinaam main to nahin kintu ghatnaon ke maamle main ek nahin hai
 The folklore accepts such changes and modifications very easily
 is sahitya kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki yah anek roopon main hote hue bhi anekta main ekta kii bhaavana se yukt hota he
 Even by changing the language of the language, there is no change in sentiment
 ek hi rachana jo kisi sthal par vahaan kii boli main pai jaati he, vahi bahut dur duusari boli main bhi mil jaati he
 This journey of the stories of expressions and arrangements of sputum songs is sometimes so long that one is surprised
 kshetron evam deshon kii seemaa manushya bhale hi nirdhaarit kar de par loksahitya ise sweekaar nahin karata
 This may have been possible because during the journey the ancient man must have taken his literature with him whenever he had gone away and left his mark at the destination which would have been accepted by the people there
 yah kram aaj bhi jari he
 When a Gramya goes to the in-laws house of Naihar, she naturally takes with her the publicities of Naihar which she remembers
 yadi uskaa vivaah maayke kii boliwale kshetra main hua tab to koi baat nahin, kintu anya boli ke kshetra main vivaah hone par vah naihar ke geeton ko sthaneey boli ke lahazon main dhaal leti he
 That work is also assisted by the in-laws of the village
 is prakaar banaav bigaad baraabar chalate rahete hai
 The nature of folk singers and singers has been going on for a long time that if they like the composition of a poet, then they bend it and adapt it to their dialect
 aisa karte samay kabhi kavi kaa naam nikaal diya jaataa he or kabhi rahane diya jaataa he
 Even today, such folk songs can be heard for proof - the way the folk songs will be found in the published texts of Sur, Kabir, Tulsi and Meera, they will not have that form
 kuch lokgeeton main to anayas hi unke naam daal die gaye hai
 This trend is found not only in Hindi but also in the folklore of other languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki aise bhajan tathaa geet lokkaviyon dwaara swayan bana liye gaye hai or unki upyogita ko badhaane ke liye ucch evam bahushrut kaviyon ke naam jod die gaye taaki adhikansh log aise geeton ko yaad kar len
 But this is not the case
 lokkavi isi sthal par to udaar hota he
 Many such hymns have been known in the folk life since when the creators are not known
 satya to yah he ki is prakaar ke bhajanon kii sankhya namyukt bhajanon kii sankhya se kahin adhik he or ve sarasata main bhi namdhari bhajanon se ghatakar nahin hai
 There is also a tendency of folklorists to express local events immediately, as happened during the 1934 Bihar earthquake
 bahut dinon se chali aa rahi aanchalik kathatmak samagriyan isi pravriti kii dein hai
 Incidental management and folklore are born with this tendency, but only long life is available to those who touch the public with more skill
 lok-sahitya kii bhashaa shisht or saahitiyik bhashaa na hokar saadhaaran jan kii bhashaa he or uski varnya-vastu lok-jivan main gruhit charitron, bhaavon or prabhaavon tak simit he
 This was the first decree of folk literature
 isaki duusari maryaada he, uski rachana main vyakti kaa nahin balki samooche samaaj kaa samavet yogadan
 This is the reason that instead of the person's impression on folk literature, it is the impression of the whole person-world
 shilp-vidhaan kii baat karte samay ham jab in do mukhya maryaadaaon ko saamne rakhte hai to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki isamen shilp-vidhaan ke liye koi abhyaas yaa kaushal parilakshith nahin ho saktaa, kyonki shilp kaa vidhaan yadi hamen dikhaata he to vah saamaajik samarasata kii vivashtaa ke kaaran apane aap udbhoot rup main hi
 In the prevailing sense, the matter of craftsmanship cannot be raised here
 log samajhate yahi hai ki shilp ke peeche ek purv-chintit vyapaar avashya sannihit hota he or chunki lok-sahitya main aisa koi vyapaar hone kii sambhaavna nahin he isliye uske shilp-vidhaan kii baat nahin uthati
 But from a physical point of view, shilp-vidhan means to connect expression with expression
 lok-sahitya main shilp-vidhaan apane utkarsh par he, kyonki vah, sabase adhik yaheen par nirabhimaan, nirvyaj or nisargodbhoot he
 There are mainly four distinctions of folk literature; Folk-songs, folk-songs, folk-tales and folk-dramas
 lok-gaatha or lok-katha main bhed itnaa hi he ki lok-gaatha ek lambe aakhyaan-geet ke rup main chalati he or isamen prabandh-yojana gaatha-pradhan na hokar ras-pradhan hoti he, jabaki lok-katha gadyatmak hone ke saath-saath katha pradhan yaa duusare shabdon main ghatana-pradhan hua karti he
 Folk theater is limited to farce or leela based on eclectic and conversational acting keeping public theater in view
 isamen samayikta kaa vishesh dhyaan rahane ke kaaran sthaayee prabhaav daalane kii kshamta nahin hoti he
 In folklore and folklore, the craft is predominant, only the folk song is such that in which the craft-structure can develop in its overall form, these four forms of craft-structure are similar in all these forms
 As expected
 loksahitya kii jo apni kuch vishesh pravritiyaan hai ve utani hi pracheen hai jitna pracheen yah sahitya he
 Confirmation of these trends is credited with making huge and different creations
 suvidha ke liye inhen nimnlikhit prakaaron main baanta ja saktaa he : The literature related to the faith which was imposed on the human being due to the various welfare results of the nature of the primitive human beings comes under it
 isamen bhakthi evam bhay donon prakaar kii bhavanaayen sannihit hoti hai
 Literature related to superstitions composed for the worship of Gods and Goddesses is under this
 inamen kuch vishwaason ko aanchalik or kuch ko vyapak mahatv diya jaataa he
 extensive works on local and local on local achievements 
 dharti, akaash, kuna, talab, nadi, naala, dih, dyohaar, mari masaan, vriksh, fasal, paudha, pashu, daitya daanav devi devtaa, kuldevataa, brahm evam tirth aadi par jo mantra yaa geet prachlit hai ve isi ke ang hai
 Whenever villagers start an auspicious work, the songs or mantras used to please the gods and goddesses associated with it all come in this literature
 rogon ke nidaan ke liye bhi bajaay oshadhi ke geeton evam mantron kaa prayog hota he
 For example, songs of Sheetla Mata can be taken
 pruthak-pruthak devi devataaon ke liye pruthak-pruthak mantra, geet, pujan evam bhoga aadi kii samagriyan pataa nahin kab se nirdhaarit kii ja chuki hai
 Somebody likes something, but Brahma should be replaced by all these
 inhen ke anusaar geet ev mantra to badalte hi hai, saath hi pujari bhi badalte rahete hai
 Under this, literature related to ethics, ideas and practicality and various popularities comes
 aachaar-vichaar ke liye rachit sahitya main bhaawanaaon or manyataon kaa pravesh he kintu vyavhaar ke liye rache gaye sahitya main yah baat kam dekhne ko milti he
 Characterization of behavior is mainly seen in folklore
 aapasi vyavhaar kii baat to jane den
 Here the snake is also fed with milk
 vriksh ko bhi baba kaha jaataa he or badali tathaa nadiyaan bahan kaa rup dhaaran karti hai
 In the same way, the whole universe has been tied in one form by connecting with many inhuman elements and violent animals
 is sandarbh main rache hue sahitya kaa mul uddeshy vyaavhaarikta ke aadhaar par saral evam sukhi jivan vyateet karnaa he
 This is the reason that life is tied up in a relationship and caste discrimination, which is rampant, has not broken its wall
 daadi dada, bhai bahan aadi ke rishte puure gaanv main bina kisi jaateey bhedbhaav ke chalaa karte hai
 Ethos prevalent for various occasions are also part of this mode
 is sahitya ke antargat rituvidya, swasthyavigyaan, krishivigyaan, evam shakun aadi se sambhddha sahitya aata he
 This type of literature occupies a very important place in the modern scientific era in folk life
 inamen purvaacharyon dwaara nirdhaarit anubhumiyon, niyamon evam tatsambandhi upadeshaatmak baton kaa samavesh hota he
 These beliefs often stand the test of examination, but there are some exceptions as well
 rituvigyaan ke antargat ativrishti, anaavrishti evam alpavrishti ke kaarnon tathaa tajjanya kshatiyon or unase bachane ke upayon kii ore sanket kiye gaye hai
 Traditional experiences are the basis of this type of scientific literature
 chunki vah anubhav bahut pakke hote hai isliye lokgeeton kii bhanti inke banane bigadane kii sambhaavnaayen kam hua karti hai
 This is the condition of literature composed for agriculture
 iske antargat kheti se sambhddha praaia: aavashyak baaten kah di gai hai
 Scientific literature, how to cultivate the field, what type of field should be sown, what is the amount of seed, when should the irrigation be done, when is the sowing and weeding done and when is the crop harvested? Under this, besides these, crop related diseases and remedies are also described
 krishi kaaryon main kaam aanevaale upkarnon tathaa belon kii pahchaan aadi par bhi baari maatra main sahityarachana kii gai he
 Apart from bullocks, there are abundant indications about other domesticated animals
 belon ke baad saarvajanik sahitya ghodon kii pahchaan ke sambandh main praapt hota he
 Since horses are kept less now due to modern scientific vehicles, this type of literature is gradually lacking
 gaanv gaanv main tractaron ke pahunch jane se belon kii pahchaan ke bare main likhe gaye sahitya kii bhi aage shaayad yahi dasha hogi
 Other domestic animals include cattle, buffalo and dogs, but they are indicated for name only
 pakshiyon main tota, maina, kaua, muniyaan, mor, koyal tathaa kabutar aadi ke bare main sanket die gaye hai
 Under this literature, there are indications about the identification of all types of animals that are used in the use of villagers, and the benefit of them
 swasthyavigyaan main vibhinn rogon ke lakshan or unase bachane ke upaay tathaa aushadhiyon kii ore sanket miltaa he
 Which disease is caused and which practices do not cause disease or go away etc
 Things fall under it
 saath hi swasthyapradayini dincharyaan ke liye kuch aadesh bhi die gaye hai
 The identification of herbs, their uses and the benefits arising out of it are also the subjects of this department
 is tarah ke sanket praaia: aadesh ke rup main prastut kiye gaye hai or ve padyon main hai
 This method has also been adopted in literature composed for agronomy and science
 shakunvichaar sambandhi sahitya main mukhya rup se yatra aarambh karne ke liye kalkrmanusaar shubh lakshanon ko dekhte hue yaa to aadesh die gaye hai yaa apshakuton ke kaaran yatrarambh ke liye manaahi kii gai he
 If the journey is very necessary and its time does not seem to be favorable in the calculation of days, then measures have been given to avoid it
 rituon, maanav lakshanon evam pashupakshiyon kii vibhinn harkaton dwaara bhi shakun apshakun kii jaankaree is prakaar ke sahitya ke antargat karai jaati he
 As one should not leave the house during the rainy season, if he calls the cork in the morning on Mundere, he should understand the information about the arrival of a dear person, etc
 sampurna loksahitya kaa ek sarvamaanya rup to hota hi he kintu saath hi vibhinn jatiyon kii paramparaagat samskruti par aadhaarit sahitya bhi hota he
 These include the personal gods and goddesses of those castes, the order of the total deity and the rules, bye-laws and their speech as stated by the Acharyas and saintly Mahatmas
 vibhinn jatiyon jaise - nai, dhobi, ahir, chamaar, kurmi, koyri, noniyaan, baar, bhaat aadi evam vanya tathaa anya jatiyon kii pruthak pruthak samskruti jaateey loksahitya ke antargat aati he
 If it is said that the entire folk culture of somewhere is a symbol of the collective culture of different castes there and will not be inappropriate
 jaateey sahitya ko nikaal dene par loksahitya kaa jo rup batch jayega vah uskaa sachcha pratinidhitiv nahin karegaa
 The composition of this literature is different from the place of creation of specific literature
 yah loksahitya kii hi visheshta he ki uske kisi bhi prakaar kaa nirmaan ekant main nahin hota
 Generally, all those places are the creators of the said literature, where from time to time, the villagers mobilize the lover or motivated by the needs
 isiilie aisa kabhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki loksahitya ke ang kaa aaj jo rup he vahi kal bhi tha or aage bhi bana rahegaa
 If we say that the main composition of folk literature is the chaupal and the courtyard, then it will not be irrational
 chaoupaalon main praaia: avkaash ke samay gaanv ke log ekatra ho jate hai
 a wide variety of things go on
 ritirivaajon kii charchaa, dharmacharchaa, katha-kahaniyaan, kheti baari kii baat tathaa loakgeet aadi samay samay par chaoupaalon ko mukherit karte rahete hai
 Local major events of the present period also remain the basis for negotiations for a few days
 in sabake nichod rup main jo saamagree jivan paa jaati he vahi kuch dinon baad sthaneey sahitya main shaamil ho jaati hai
 If the importance is more then the propagation of such compositions increases and they keep expanding their area from one chaupal to another and from one village to another
 is prakaar ve rachanaayen kuch varshon main vistrut loksahitya ke bhandar main sammilit ho jaati hai
 The same applies to the literature composed in the augon, where the gramayas gather from time to time
 is tarah purushon evam striyon kaa sahitya janm se hi pruthak-pruthak hota he
 Apart from chaupals and courtyards, there are some places where different genres of this literature are produced
 kheton main nirvaahee athwa katiyaa karte samay, daanth ke gatthar dhote samay, anya samuhik mazdooree karte samay, tirth athwa mela yatra main, jaade main siankal alaavon ke paas, parvon evam saanskarik aayojanon ke samay athwa sankshep main yah kahie ki jab or jahaan gramin stri purushon ke jutav kaa avasar aata he tab or tahaan loksahitya kaa nirmaan hota rahata he
 It cannot be said that all the folklore created in the past is alive and those which are being built today will never end
 sach to yah he ki is sahitya kii vidhaayen yugaprabhav ko sweekaar karke apana rup baraabar badalati rahati hai
 Looking at the literature composed within fifty years, this also becomes clear
 is avadhi main gaanvon ko jitani vaigyanik uplabdhiyaan praapt hui hai unamem adhikansh kaa samavesh loksahitya main ho chukaa he
 The folklore of this era has accepted airplanes directly, except for the magic flying arrows in the ancient folklore
 vaise loksahitya main baiylgaadee, ghoda, oont, hathi tathaa nauka aadi vaahan ab bhi jivit hai kintu motor evam railgadee ne bhi apana sthaan bana liya he
 New constructions taking place in the present period are also getting place in the said literature
 in saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath ve sabhi lakshan bhi lage hue hai jo unhen deergh jivan pradaan karte hai
 Scholars often say that if the collection of extensive folk literature is not done, they will be lost
 baat sahi he kyonki yugaprabhav ke kaaran pracheen rachanaayen anupyukt prathit hone lagati hai or phir dhire dhire lupt ho jaati hai, jaisaa ki is samay ho bhi rahaa he
 The songs of cinema have made their place in the villages, due to which the folklore is attaining attenuation
 shiksha kaa prasar hone ke kaaran bhi gaanvon kii boliyon main geet gaanevaale purushon evam striyon kaa abhaav hota ja rahaa he
 It seems that in a few days, ancient folk songs sung on the occasion of various rites will be erased and new songs will be replaced in their place, or if desired, women will study by looking at the collections of folklore and sing songs
 aataa pisanevaali kal gaanv main pahunch chuki he or bhi bahut se yantron kaa prasar hota ja rahaa he isliye "zantsar" tathaa kuch anya shram sambandhi geeton kii kami hoti ja rahi he
 Similarly, the events of the present era are also being accepted in it
 jhansi kii rani, kunwar singh, gandhi ji, subhaashachandr, bhagat singh, khudiram evam chandrashekhar aaazaad aadi loksahitya main pratishtha ke saath jivit hai
 These heroic fighters have been added to the same episode which contains the names of the heroes of ancient times
 uparyukt viven se loksahitya kaa sthaan spasht ho jaataa he kintu dharaatal se uthanevaale is sahitya ne apana ek sheershasth sthaan bhi banaaya he jahaan use vaidic sahitya ke samakaksh asana praapt he
 The proof is that many and especially ceremonial and religious works of our folk life are completed by Vedic mantras
 jahaan ye mantra sanskrit main padhe jate hai vahiin graamyaon dwaara gaae janevaale loakgeet tathaa lokachar par aadhaarit anya kriyalap bhi chalate rahete hai
 Another priest chants and the other village women sing songs
 mundan, karnavedh, yagyopavit tathaa vivaah aadi sanskaron par or makaan, dharmashala, kunaan tathaa talab aadi kaa shubharambh karte samay bhi mantra tathaa loakgeet saath saath chalate hai
 The same cultural and religious and charitable work is not found in folk life where folklore does not have a place with Vedic literature

 ek baar hastinapur naresh dushyant akhet khilne van main gayi
 The forest where he went for hunting was the ashram of Kanva Rishi
 kanv rishi ke darshan karne ke liye maharaj dushyant unke ashram pahunch gayi
 On calling, a very lavish girl left the ashram and said, “O Rajan! Maharishi has gone on pilgrimage, but you are welcome in this ashram
 ” us kanya ko dekh kar maharaj dushyant ne poocha, “balike! aap koun hai?” balika ne kaha, “meraa naam shakuntala he or main kanv rishi kii putree hoon
 Hearing that girl, Maharaja Dushyant said in surprise, "maharishi is a born Brahmachari then how are you his daughter?" In response to his question, Shakuntala said, "actually my parents are Maneka and Vishwamitra
 meri mata ne mere janm hote hi mujhe van main chhod diya tha jahaan par shakunth naamak pakshi ne meri raksha kii
 That is why my name was Shakuntala
 uske baad kanv rishi kii drushti mujh par padi or ve mujhe apane ashram main le aaye
 He was the one who fed me
 janm dene vaala, poshan karne vaala tathaa ann dene vaala – ye teenon hi pita kahe jate hai
 In this way Kanva Rishi became my father
 ” Hearing Shakuntala's words, Maharaj Dushyant said, "shakuntale! You are a Kshatriya girl
 tumhaare soundarya ko dekh kar main apana hriday tumhen arpit kar chukaa hoon
 If you have no objection, then i want to marry you
 ” shakuntala bhi maharaj dushyant par mohit ho chuki thi, atah usne apni sweekruti pradaan kar di
 Both got married to Gandharva
 kuch kaal maharaj dushyant ne shakuntala ke saath vihaar karte huye van main hi vyateet kiya
 Then one day he said to Shakuntala, "dear! Now i have to leave Hastinapur to see my kingdom
 maharishi kanv ke tirth yatra se laut aane par main tumhen yahan se vidaa kara kar apane rajbhavan main le jaaungaa
 Saying so, Maharaj gave Shakuntala his gold ring as a token of his love and went to Hastinapur
 ek din uske ashram main durvasa rishi padhaare
 Shakuntala did not even know of his arrival due to being absorbed against Maharaja Dushyant and did not welcome Durvasa Rishi properly
 durvasa rishi ne ise apana apmaan samajha or krodhit ho kar bole, “balike! main tuje shaap detaa hoon ki jis kisi ke dhyaan main leen hokar tuune meraa niraadar kiya he, vah tuje bhul jaayegaa
 Hearing the curse of Durvasa Rishi, Shakuntala's attention was broken and she fell at his feet and started praying for forgiveness
 shakuntala ke kshamaa prarthana se dravit ho kar durvasa rishi ne kaha, “acha yadi tere paas uskaa koi prem chinh hoga to us chinh ko dekh use teri smriti ho aayegi
 " maharaj dushyant ke sahavaas se shakuntala garbhvatee ho gai thi
 After some time Kanva Rishi returned from pilgrimage, then Shakuntala told him about his Gandharva marriage with Maharaj Dushyant
 is par maharishi kanv ne kaha, “putree! vivaahit kanya kaa pita ke ghar main rahanaa uchit nahin he
 Now your husband's house is your home
 ” itnaa kah kar maharishi ne shakuntala ko apane shishyon ke saath hastinapur bhijwa diya
 While walking in a lake on the way, the ring of Shakuntala given by King Dushyant, which was a love sign, fell in the lake itself
 us anguthi ko ek machhlee nigal gai
 Upon reaching King Dushyant, the disciples of Kanva Rishi stood Shakuntala in front of him and said, "maharaj! Shakuntala is your wife, you accept it
 ” maharaj to durvasa rishi ke shaap ke kaaran shakuntala ko vismrit kar chuke the
 Therefore, he did not accept Shakuntala and started attacking him
 shakuntala kaa apmaan hote hi akaash main joro kii bijli kadak uthi or sab ke saamne uski mata menka use uthaa le gai
 The fish, which swallowed Shakuntala's ring, got caught in a fisherman's net one day
 jab machuaare ne use kaata to uske pet anguthi nikali
 The fisherman sent the ring to Maharaja Dushyant as an offering
 anguthi ko dekhte hi maharaj ko shakuntala kaa samaran ho aayaa or ve apane krity par pashchaatap karne lage
 Maharaj found Shakuntala very much but did not find her
 kuch dinon ke baad devraj indra ke nimantran paakar devasur sangram main unki sahaayta karne ke liye maharaj dushyant indra kii nagari amravati gayi
 After conquering the war, when he was returning to Hastinapur by sky route, he saw the ashram of Rishi Kashyapa on the way
 unke darshanon ke liye ve vahaan ruk gayi
 In the ashram, a handsome boy was playing with a fierce lion
 menka ne shakuntala ko kashyap rishi ke paas laakar choda tha tathaa vah balak shakuntala kaa hi putr tha
 On seeing that child, a feeling of love rose in the heart of Maharaj
 ve use god main uthaane ke liye aage bade to shakuntala kii sakhi chilla uthi, “he bhadra purush! aap is balak ko na chhuyen anyathaa uski bhujaa main bandhaa kaala doraa saanp ban kar aapako das legaa
 On hearing this, Dushyant could not stop himself and lifted the child in his lap
 ab sakhi ne aashcharya se dekha ki balak ke bhujaa main bandhaa kaala ganda prithvi par gir gaya he
 Sakhi knew that whenever his father would take the child in his lap, that black thread would fall to the earth
 sakhi ne prasann ho kar samast vrutant shakuntala ko sunaaya
 Shakuntala Maharaj came to Dushyant
 maharaj ne shakuntala ko pahchaan liya
 He prayed forgiveness to Shakuntala for his act and took the permission of Rishi Kashyapa and brought him along with his son to Hastinapur
 maharaj dushyant or shakuntala ke us putr kaa naam bharat tha
