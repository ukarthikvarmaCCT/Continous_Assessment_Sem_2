jaisaa jataka ne karm kiya he uskaa puraa puraa bhugtan karnaa hi shanidev kaa kaary he
 The gem of Saturn is Sapphire
 praani maatr ke sharir main lohe kii maatra sab dhaatuon se adhik hoti he, sharir main lohe kii maatra kam hote hi uskaa chalanaa firanaa dubhar ho jaataa he
 And how many diseases are caused in the body
 isaliye hi iske louh kam hone se paidaa hue rogon kii aushadhi khaane se bhi faaydaa nahi ho to jataka ko samaj lenaa chaiye ki shani kharaab chal rahaa he
 Shani is the lord of Capricorn and Aquarius
 iskaa ucch tula raashi main or neech mesh raashi main anubhav kiya jaataa he
 Its metals are considered iron, cereal gram, and urad dal in pulses
 shani ke chamatkaarik siddh peethon main teen peeth hi mukhya maane jate hai, in siddh peethon me jane or apane kiye gayi paapwon kii kshamaa maagane se jo bhi paap hote hai unke andar kami aakar jataka ko foran laabh miltaa he
 Those who consider these miraculous peaks to be a fantasy can only be said to them, that according to their old virtuous deeds, as long as their life is going well, it can be said to be right, in the future when the difficulty comes
 If they come, they too will look for these perfect benches, and they will also remember that they had mocked anyone
 agar in siddh peethon ke prati manyata nahi hoti to aaj se saade teen hajaar saal pehle se kitne hi un logon kii tarah budhimaan logon ne janm liya hoga, or apni apni karte karte mar gayi honge
lekin ve peeth aaj bhi jyon ke tyon he or logon kii manyata aaj bhi waisi kii waisi hi he
 There is a wonderful miracle of Shanidev in Shinganapur village
 is gaanv main aaj tak kisi ne apane ghar main taala nahi lagaaya, isi baat se andaaj lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kitni mahanata is siddh peeth main he
 In today's history, no thief has come and stolen in this village, even if someone has tried, he was immediately victimized
 darshan, puja, tel snaan, shanidev ko karwaane se turant shani peedaaon main kami aajaati he, lekin vah hi yahaan pahunchataa he, jiske upar shanidev kii krupa ho gayi hoti he
 Mahavir is the body of the supernatural Shanidev thrown from Lanka by Hanumanji, Shanishachari Amavashya holds a fair here
 or jataka shani dev par tel chadhaakar unase gale milte hai
 Also, wearing clothes, shoes, etc
, leave there all the poverty and leave the tribulations and go to their respective homes
 is peeth kii puja karne par bhi turant fal miltaa he
 People have a habit of laughing
 ramayana ke puspak vimaan kii baat sun kar log jo nahi samajhate the, ve hansi kiya karte the, jab tak swayan rameswaram ke darshan nahi karen, tab tak pathar bhi pani main tair sakate hai, vishwaas hi nahi hota, lekin jab ramkund ke paas jaakar us pathar ke darshan kiye or saakshaat rup se pani main tairta hua paaya to sivaay namaskara karne ke or kuch samaj main nahi aayaa
 When Lord Krishna saw the banshee with one foot standing on it, it was understood that if the scholars selected the good of the seed in the seed mantra of Shani Dev, if he is punished outlined, then no one else is himself Shani Dev Only Lord Krishna will be considered as this
 This Siddha Peeth is six kilometers away from Kosi and the Kokila forest adjoining Nanda village, in this forest, Lord Shri Krishna in Dwapar Yuga who completed sixteen arts God, he appeared to Shani according to the stories and stories of the Puranas, and also blessed that this forest belongs to him, and who will revolve around this forest, and worship Shani Dev, he is like my grace
 Will be able to receive grace
 And whoever believes in this Shani Siddha Peetha, will be inwardly inclined to worship and believe in goodwill, he will not suffer from any disturbance of Shani
 Seems fair
 jataka apane apane shraddhanusaar koi dandavat parikrama karata he, yaa koi paidal parikrama karata he, jo log shani dev kaa raja dasharath krit stotra kaa paath karte hue, yaa shani ke beej mantra kaa jaap karte huye parikrama karte hai, unako achche falon kii sheeghra prapti ho jaati he
 According to astrology, there are three kinds of beliefs of Saturn's Saadhesati, firstly, secondly by Chandra Lagan or Zodiac and third by Sun Lagna, in North India, the calculation of Saturn's half-sati by Chandra Lagana has been in practice since ancient times
 
 is manyata ke anusaar jab shanidev chandra raashi par gochar se apana bhraman karte hai to sadhesati maani jaati he, iskaa prabhaav raashi main aane ke tees maah pehle se or tees maah baad tak anubhav hota he
 During Sadesati, Saturn takes account of the deeds done by the native in the same way as the owner asks for the account after some time after giving full responsibility to the servant of a house, and in the case of mistake or mistake Punishment is given to the servant, similarly Shani Dev also punishes every creature
 or yahi nahi jin logon ne achche karm kiye hote hai to unako sadheshaati puraskaar bhi pradaan karti he, jaise nagar yaa gram kaa yaa shahar kaa mukhiya bana diya janaa aadi
shani kii sadhesati ke aakhyaan anek logon ke praapt hote hai, jaise raja vikramaditya, raja nal, raja harishchandr, shani kii sadhesati sant mahatmaon ko bhi pratadit karti he, jo jog ke saath bhoga ko apnaane lagate hai
 Every person must have a Sadesati once in thirty years, if this half-and-half is in Sagittarius, Pisces, Capricorn, Aquarius, it is less painful, if it will be in the fourth, sixth, eighth, and twelfth house, So the person will be unhappy, and all the happiness will be physical, mental, and economic
 They should never forget the "sapphire" in these Sadesati, if done, there is a possibility of loss of profit
 koi nayaa kaam, nayaa udyog, bhul kar bhi sadhesati main nahi karnaa chaiye, kisi bhi kaam ko karne se pehle kisi jaankaar jyotishi se jaankaree avashya kar leni chaiye
yahaan tak ki vaahan ko bhi bhuulakar is samay main nahi khareednaa chaiye, anyathaa vah vaahan sukh kaa vaahan na hokar dukhon kaa vaahan ho jaayegaa
hamane apane pichley pachchis saal ke anubhav me dekha he ki sadhesati main kitne hi udyogpatiyon kaa bura haal ho gaya, or jo crorespati the, ve rodpati hokar ek gamche main ghoomane lage
is prakaar se yah bhi naubhav kiya ki shani jab bhi chaar, chha:, aath, baarah me vicharan karegaa, to uskaa mul dhan to nasht hoga hi, kitna hi jatan kyon na kiya jaye
or shani ke is samay kaa vichaar pehle se kar liya gaya he to dhan kii raksha ho jaati he
 If caution is not taken then only remorse remains
 at: prayek manushya ko is samay kaa shani armbh hone ke pehle hi jap tap or jo vidhaan ham aage baataayenge unako kar lenaa chaiye
shani dev ke prakope se bachane ke liye ravan ne unhen apni kaid main pairon se baandh kar sar neeche kii taraf kiye hue rakhaa tha taaki shani kii vakr drushti ravan pe na pade
 Even today, many Hindus know how to hang the Shani model upside down in shops or vehicles, symbolically like Ravana
 haalanki puranic suzav shri hanuman kii bhakthi karne kaa he, kyoki shani dev ne hanuman ji ko vardaan diya tha ki hanuman bhakton par shani kii vakr drushti nahin padegi
 Shanidev is considered to be the ultimate doer of justice and the ultimate planetary planet of the creature
 ishwar parayan praani jo janm janmaantar tapasya karte hai, tapasya safal hone ke samay avidya, maaya se sammohit hokar patit ho jate hai, arthath tap purna nahi kar pate hai, un tapasweon kii tapasya ko safal karne ke liye shanidev param krupaalu hokar bhavi janmon main pun: tap karne kii prerana detaa he
 When the Saturn sees the Moon, or the Moon is seen by Saturn, it makes a high-quality saint in the Dreskan horoscope
 or aisa vyakti paariwarik moh se virakt hokar kar mahaan sant bana kar bairangy detaa he
 Saturn makes a high-level Mahatma by giving a human without a sense of mind to put all the attitudes of the creature into the divine to complete the tenacity of a previous birth
 taaki vartmaan janm main uski tapasya safal ho jaave, or vah parmanand kaa anand lekar prabhu darshan kaa saubhaahgya praapt kar sake
yah chandramaa or shani kii upasna se sulabh ho paata he
 Saturn gives inspiration to meditate
 or shani uske man ko paramatma main sthit karata he
 Because Saturn opens the wisdom eye of the native in the Navagrahas
 skanda puraana main kaashi khand main vrutant aata he, ki chaaya sut shri shanidev ne apane pita bhagwaan surya dev se prashn kiya ki he pita! mai aisa pad praapt karnaa chahta hoon, jise aaj tak kisi ne praapt nahi kiya, he pita ! aapke mandal se meraa mandal saat guna bada ho, mujhe aapse adhik saat guna shakti praapt ho, mere veg kaa koi saamana nahi kar paye, chaahe vah dev, asur, daanav, yaa siddh sadhak hi kyon na ho

mai bhi tere prabhaav ko sahan nahi kar sakuun, iske liye tuje tap karnaa hoga, tap karne ke liye tu kaashi chalaa ja, vahaan jaakar bhagwaan shankar kaa ghanghor tap kar, or shivlinga kii sthapana kar, tathaa bhagwaan shankar se manavaanchit falon kii prapti kar le
shani dev ne pita kii aagyaanusaar vaisaa hi kiya, or tap karne ke baad bhagwaan shankar ke vartmaan main bhi sthit shivlinga kii sthapana kii, jo aaj bhi kaashi-vishwanath ke naam se janaa jaataa he, or karm ke kaarak shani ne apane manovanchit falon kii prapti bhagwaan shankar se kii, or grahon main sarvopari pad praapt kiya

 Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi was an Islamic scholar and was mainly responsible for the establishment of the Deoband movement
 nanotvi kaa janm 1833 main bharat ke rajya uttar pradesh ke saharanpur ke paas ek gaanv nanota main siddiki parivaar main hua
 It was his unwavering intention to establish an Islamic religious seminary, with the intention of moving to Saharanpur to establish Darul Uloom Deoband
 vah sharia or sunnat ke anuroop the or anya logon ko aisa karne ke liye prerit karne kaa kaam bhi kiya karte the
 It was through his work that a major madrasa was established in Deoband and a mosque was also built
 apane prayaason ke madhyam se, islamic skulon kii sthapana kai anya sthanon par bhi kii gai
 He completed his early education at his birthplace Nagar and was then sent to Deoband, where he studied in the madrasa of Maulvi Mahtab Ali
 phir vah saharanpur gaye, jahaan vah apane dada ke saath rahete the
 There he became a disciple of Maulvi Nawaz and also studied primary books of Arabic grammar and syntax
 1843 ke ant main, mamluk-ul-ali ne unhen dilli bhej diya
 There, he studied Kafiyya and also studied various books
 baad main unhen madrasa gajuuddin khan main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 His close relative, Mohammad Yakub Nanotvi, wrote: mere swargeey pita ne unhen arabi madras main namankit kiya or kaha, 'apane aap ko adhyayan karen or ankaganitiya abhyaas puraa karen
 'after a few days, he attended all the general discourses and completed the arithmetic exercises
 munshi jakatulla ne unke kuch sawaal poocha, jo mushkil the
 Because he was able to solve them, he became famous
 jab vaarshik pariksha paas ho gai, to usne ise nahin likhaa or madrasa chhod diya
 The entire staff of the madrasa, especially the headmaster, expressed great regret
 madrasa gajuddin khan main unke namakan se pehle, unhone apane ghar par maamluk ali ke tahat tark, darshan or shaikshik dharamshastra par kitabon kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He joined a study circle, which had a central position in India regarding the teaching of the Quran and Hadith
 unhone abdul gani mujaddidi kii tahat haddees kaa adhyayan kiya
 After completing his education, Nanottavi became the editor of the press at matka-e-ahmadi
 is avadhi ke dauraan, ahamed ali ke aagrah par, unhone sahihul bukhari ke pichley kuch hisson main ek vidwaan likhaa tha
 Before the establishment of Darul Uloom Deoband, he taught Euclid for some time in the Chhatti Mosque
 unke vyaakhyaan printing press par pahunche the
 His teaching formed a group of complete Ulmas, examples of which were not seen since the time of Shah Abdul Ghani
 1860 main, unhone haj kaa pradarshan kiya or, unki vaapasi par, unhone meerut main mataka-e-mujataba main pustaken ekatra karne kaa pesha sweekaar kar liya
 Nanotti remained associated with this press until 1868

 Muhammad Munir Nanautawi and Maulvi Ilahi Bakhes Rangin Bareilly, along with Nanottavi, also attended the suggestion of several colleagues
 in sabhi ulamaa ne meley main bhaashan die
 In his rejection of the doctrine of the Trinity and Polytheism, and the affirmation of divine unity, Nanotti spoke so well that the audience, who were both against him and who were for him, were convinced
 ek samachar patr ne likhaa: At the 8 May assembly of the current year, Muhammad Qasim gave a lecture and stated the merits of Islam
 padra sahib ne trinity ko ek ajeeb tareeke se samajhaayaa, jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek pankti main teen gun paae jate hai: lambaai, chaudaai or gaharaai, or is prakaar trinity har tarah se sabit hoti he
 Maulvi Sahib is said to have immediately accepted it
 phir, jab padra sahib or maulavi sahib bhaashan ke bare main bahes kar rahe the, to baithak tut gai, or aasapaas ke ilaakon main or sabhi pakshon ne musalamaanon ko jeetne vaali chillaahat uthi
 Wherever Islam's religious divinity stood, thousands of men would gather around it
 pehle din kii baithak main isaiyon ne islam ke anuyaayiyon dwaara uthaae gaye aapattiyon kaa jawaab nahin diya, jabaki muslimon ne isai shabd ko shabd se jeeta or jeeta
 He participated in the Indian rebellion of 1857 in the Battle of Shamli between the British and the colonists
 ant main us ladaai main ulma ko parajeet kiya gaya tha

 unke dhyaan or paryvekshan ke tahat, madrason kii sthapana thanabhavan, galotti, kerana, danapur, meerut or muradabad jaise kshetron main hui thi
 Most of them still exist, providing educational and religious services in the area around them
 apane jeevankaal ke dauraan, isai dharm bharat main badhane laga or bharat ke logon ko badalane ke liye shandaar prayaas kiye gaye
 When Nanotvi saw this situation during his time in Delhi, he ordered his pupils to stand in the markets and preach against Christianity
 ek din, vah khud ko agyaat rup se ek sabha main bhaag liya or bazaar main isai dharm ke khilaaf vyaakhyaan diya
 Qasim Nanotvi died in 1880 at the age of 47
 unki kabr daarul-ulum ke uttar main he
 The place is known as kabastran-e-qasimi, where countless Deobandi scholars, students and others are buried
 moulana abd al-haiy lakhanu moulana kasim nanauthvi ke bare main likhte hai: He was satyasandhi and ascetic and pious of all people, the holiest of them, and the most frequently meddling and contemplative, and did not dress like 'allama' and even the clothes of students or graduates of jurisprudence
 Away, wearing a turban or shawl etc

 The aforesaid Sheikh Imadad Allah succeeded him, and praised him by saying that "a scholar like Qasim is a milla sakta only in the old Dor, not in modern times"

 samuhik suraksha se aashay aisi kshetreey yaa vaishvik suraksha-vyavastha se he jiskaa prayek ghatak rajya yah sweekaarta he ki kisi ek rajya kii suraksha sabhi kii chintaa kaa vishay he
 It is a more ambitious system than the system of friendship protection
 shakti vistaar va vishwa main yudhon ko rokane kaa ek kargar madhyam samuhik suraksha mana gaya he
 Under this, collective efforts have been made by the nations to achieve the goal of security
 yadhyapi yah siddhanth pratham vishwayuddh va dwitiya vishwayuddh kii samaapti ke uparant sthapit rashtrasang evam sanyukt raashtra sanghathanon ke antargat apanaaya gaya, parantu isaki upasthiti ko 17veen shatabdi ke kai vidwaanon ke granthon main paaya jaataa he
 It was also mentioned in the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 that the states signing this treaty have the right to take action and take action against anyone so that peace can be protected
 baad main oszebruk kii sandhi main bhi sambhavit shatruon ke viruddh samuhik kaarywahi karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 Many writers also supported it in the 19th century, but it received its practical form in the 20th century only under the League of Nations and the United Nations
 saamaanya rup se sateek paribhaasha de ton iskaa arth he- ”ek ke liye sab or sab ke liye ek
 "in this way, everyone will be ready to take collective action for the peace and security of a nation
" parantu is prakaar kii kaarywahi se purv yah bataanaa aavashyak he ki is avadharana kii kuch aadharbhoot manyataayen hai, jo nimnlikhit hai- Thus, based on the above assumptions, collective security system can run the power management smoothly
 saiddhanthik rup se is vyavastha kii nimnalikhat visheshtaayen spasht rup se ujagar hoti hai - Firstly, the description of this was included till 10–16 of the contract of the United Nations
 in dhaaraon main iskaa varnan nimna prakaar se he- But despite appropriate provisions, the League of Nations never used them
 raashtra sangh ke asafalataa hetu jimmedaar tatwon ne samuhik suraksha vyavastha par bhi prabhaav daalaa
 It mainly consists of America not becoming a member of the League of Nations, continuation of rivalry between the conquered and defeated nations, differences of Germany and France staying there, the Soviet Union staying out of this organization, changing the membership of the Council, Japan, Germany and There are many reasons why Italy's open contempt of it, because of which the League of Nations failed, except for the first few years
 atah swabhaavik tha ki samuhik suraksha kii bhi vifaltaa anivaary thi
 Therefore, in the context of the development and implementation of collective security, the League was completely misguided and powerless from the beginning
 raashtra sangh ke anubhavon se shiksha lete hue sanyukt raashtra charter main iskaa ati spasht aalekh kiya gaya
 Although the term "collective security" is not used in the entire charter, in chapter seven, 'joint action' is the form of collective security
 saiddhanthik rup main charter main chaar vyavasthaaon ke antargat iskaa ullekh he - Part 1 of the United Nations Charter, stating its objectives, Article 1 states that the United Nations / Group will take action for international peace and security
 kshetriy shaanti va suraksha hetu ye sanghathan sanyukt raashtra kii anumati ke saath samuhik kaarywahi kar sakate hai
 At the time of the crisis of Korea in 1950, the General Assembly has arranged through a unity resolution for peace that if the Security Council does not take any action on the threat of international peace and security, then the General Assembly can ask the Security Council to take action 
 atah uparokt teenon paristhitiyon se spasht he ki sanyukt raashtra charter ke uddeshyon evam vyavhaar main samuhik suraksha kii vyavastha kii gai he
 This is interpreted as a punitive action in Chapter 7 in real terms
 iske antargat kaarywahi se purv anuchhed 41 main gaiyr sainik kadam uthaane par jor diya gaya he taaki akramanakari rajya vishwa shaanti ko khatra na bane
 After this, siege is arranged in Article 42
 antatah sainya kaarywahi kaa praavdhaan he jisamen sabhi rashtron kaa daayitv he ki ve sena main apana sahyog denge 
 After this, there is talk of the formation of a military staff committee which will take action under the flag of the United Nations under a commander
 atah is prakaar sabhi anya kaarywahi ke vifaltaa ke baad yuddh kii kaarywahi ko sweekrut kiya he
 Apart from this, it has also been clarified that the leader of this action will be the commander of the United Nations and not of any one country or other organization
 is kaarywahi hetu bhaag lene ke liye adhikansh deshon kaa hona anivaary nahin to kam se kam vaanchhneeya avashya he
 Whether collective action is able to restrain or limit power under the United Nations can only be said after evaluating its theoretical and practical aspects
 saiddhanthik rup se, isaki safalataa ke sandarbh main kai prashn uthaaye gayi hai
 Do all nations recognize the invader? Are everyone fully willing to stop the attack? Are mass groups more powerful than invaders? Is world peace power possible in detail? Will all countries be able to forget the national interests and unite? e

 saiddhanthik ke saath-saath vyavhaarik rup se bhi dekhen to shityudh tathaa uttar-shityudh kaalon main apni-apni prakaar se samuhik suraksha kii avhelnaa kii he
 In the Cold War period, the question of war and peace was decided on the basis of ideology
 isi prakaar sanyukt raashtra ke faislon par samarthan
 That is why the collective security action against Korea, which took place in this era, could not be completely successful
 balki yah kaarywahi bhi vishesh sthiti main hi sambhav ho saki jab yah nirnay diya gaya ki sanyukt raashtra kii kaarywahi se gaiyr-hajir rahanaa vito nahin mana ja saktaa
 It would be wrong to call the action against Iraq in the post-cold War era objective and objective
 yah kaarywahi bhi mukhya rup se america va nato deshon yaa baad main america va britain kii sanyukt kaarywahi kaha ja saktaa he
 During this action neither the sections of the United Nations Charter were followed nor efforts were made to avert war
 balki aisa laga ki apane kuch aspasht hiton kii purti hetu yah yuddh ladaa gaya
 In addition, now, after the massive destruction of the war, the us's acknowledgment that it was misinformed in terms of weapons makes all of this development ridiculous
 parantu kya aisa kehane se iraq ke nuksaan kii bharpai ho jaayegi
 But the reality is that in the post-cold War era it is impossible for America to stop any action due to it being the only power
 atah america dwaara kiye gaye sabhi akraman uchit maane jaayenge
 Thus, it can be concluded that under the circumstances of both theory and practice it is now difficult to curb the power on the basis of collective security
 kaaran jo bhi ho yah baat shityudh kaal main bhi satya thi or aaj shityudhottar yug main bhi sahi he
 Along with this, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stop wars in the context of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
 atah is siddhanth hetu shakti par simaaen lagaana adhik kargar nahin rahaa

 Raghuvansh is an epic poem composed by Kalidas
 is mahakavy main unniis sargon main raghu ke kul main utpann bees raajaaon kaa ikkis prakaar ke chhandon kaa prayog karte hue varnan kiya gaya he
 In it, special descriptions of Dilip, Raghu, Dasaratha, Rama, Kush and Atithi are given
 ve sabhi samaaj main adarsh sthapit karne main safal hue
 Rama is described in this
 unniis main se chah sarg unase hi sambandhit hai
 Adikavi Valmiki composed his Ramayana by making Rama a hero, which many poets and writers of the world followed in their own language and presented the story of Rama in their own way
 kalidas ne yadhyapi ram kii katha rachi parantu is katha main unhone kisi ek paatr ko nayak ke rup main nahin ubhaara
 He composed the story of the entire dynasty in his work 'raghuvansh', which begins with Dileep and ends at Agnivarna
 agnivarn ke maranoparant uski garbhvatee patni ke rajyabhishek ke uparant is mahakavy kii itishree hoti he
 The oldest available commentary on Raghuvansh is that of the 10th-century Kashmiri poet Vallabhadeva
 kintu sarvaadhik prasiddh tikaa mallinath dwaara rachit 'sanjivani' he
 Kalidasa has divided the story of 'raghuvansh' into 19 cantos, in which the stories of Raja Dileep, Raghu, Aj, Dasaratha, Ram, Luv, Kush, Atithi and the later twenty Raghuvanshi kings have been recited
 is vansh kaa patan uske antim raja agnivarn ke vilasita kii ati ke kaaran hota he or yaheen is kriti kii iti bhi hoti he
 The following list of Raghuvanshi kings mentioned in twenty-one cantos is as follows - is katha ke madhyam se kavi kalidas ne raja ke charitra, adarsh tathaa rajdharm jaise vishyon kaa bada sundar varnan kiya he
 There is also a part of this chapter of Suryavansh in the history of India, in which there is a message that on the one hand, fame and fame of the king who maintains the religion is spread all over the country, on the other hand, due to the characterless king, there is certain loss and descent, Even if he is a descendant of any higher lineage! samalochakon ne kalidas kaa sarvshereshth mahakavy 'raghuvansh' ko mana he
 From the beginning to the end, the singular skill of the accomplished poet is expressed in it
 dilip or sudakshina ke tapomay jivan se prarambh is kavy main kramash: raghuvanshi raajaaon kii vadanyata, veerta, tyaag or tap kii ek ke baad ek kahani udghaatit hoti he or kavy kii samaapti kaamuk agnivarn kii vilasita or unke avsaan se hoti he
 Dilip and Sudakshina's tenacity: the demeanor, the dialogue of Kautas and Raghu, the disciples of Varatantu, the picture of Indumati Swayamvara, Ajavilapa, the voyage of Rama and Sita, the glory of exiled Sita, the confluence, the emptiness of the city of Ayodhya, etc
 And the reader looks at them with an amused look
 anek kathankon kaa ekatrikaran hone par bhi is mahakavy main kavi ne unka ek duusare se ek prakaar samanvay kar diya he jisase unamem swaabhaavik pravaah kaa sanchaar ho gaya he
 In this lit Nakshatramala of many nappies of 'raghuvansh', the poet has given Tejavita and dignity to the glorious Rama of Adikavi Valmiki
 varnanon kii sajivta, aagat prasargon kii swaabhaaviktaa, style kaa maadhurya tathaa bhav or bhashaa kii drushti se 'raghuvansh' sanskritmahakavyon main anupam he
 The style of the Raghuvansha epic is simple and not prashanti, simple and prasadagunmayi
 alankaaron kaa suruchipurna prayog swaabhaavik evam sahaj sundar he
 In the selected words, the poet has taken the wonderful trick of showing the beauty of the favored object in the thirteenth canto of 'raghuvansh', with a beautiful tableau of the subject
 ganga or yamuna ke sangam kii, unke mishrit jal ke pravaah kii chata kaa varnan karte samay ek ke baad ek upamaaon kii shrunkhlaa upasthit karte hue ant main kavi ne shiv ke sharir ke saath-saath uski shobhaa kii upama di he or is prakaar saundarya ko seemaa se nikaalkar anant ke haathon saunp diya- Kalidas is an expressive poet of mainly gentle and delightful expressions
 isiilie prakruti kaa komal, manoram or madhur paksh unki is kriti main bhi ankit hua he
 In the beginning of Raghuvansh poetry, Mahakavi has given many types of delightful sermons for pranamatras on the pretext of describing the importance and merit of the kings of Raghukul
 raghuvansh kavy main kalidas ne raghuvanshi raajaaon ko nimitt banaakar udarcharit purushon kaa swabhaav pathakon ke sammukh rakhaa he
 If you want to know the description of Raghuvanshi kings in a nutshell, then in one verse of Raghuvansh, its result is as follows- ) The story of 'raghuvansh' begins with Dilip and his wife Sudakshina's entry into the ashram of sage Vasistha
 raja dilip dhanwaan, gunwan, budhimaan or balavaan he, saath hi dharmaparayan bhi
 They are rich in every way, but there is a shortage of children
 santan prapti kaa aashirwad paane ke liye dilip ko gomata nandini kii seva karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 As usual, Nandini is wandering in the forest and Dileep also walks along to guard her
 itane main ek singh nandini ko apana bhojan bananaa chahta he
 Dilip dedicates himself and begs Singh to make him his diet
 singh prarthana sweekaar kar letaa he or unhen maarane ke liye jhapatata he
 With this leap, the lion disappears
 tab nandini bataati he ki usee ne dilip kii pariksha lene ke liye yah mayajaal rachaa tha
 Nandini is pleased with Dilip's service and blesses her son's attainment
 raja dilip or sudakshina nandini kaa doodh grahan karte hai or unhen putr ratna kii prapti hoti he
 This talented son is named Raghu, due to his might, this dynasty is known as Raghuvansh
 raghu ke parakram kaa varnan kalidas ne vistaarpurvak apane granth ‘raghuvansh’ main kiya he
 On stealing the horse of Ashwamedha Yagya, he fought with Indra and had rescued him
 unhone vishwajit yajna sampann karke apana sara dhan daan kar diya tha
 When he had no money, one day Rishiputra Kauts came and asked him for 14 crores gold coins so that he could give his Guru Dakshina
 raghu ne is brahman ko santusht karne ke liye kuber par chadhai karne kaa man banaaya
 On receiving this information, Kuber panicked and filled his treasure by himself
 raghu ne sara khazaana brahman ke hawaale kar diya; parantu us brahmanputra ne keval 14 karod mudraaen hi sweekaari
 Raghu's son Aj was also very powerful
 unhone vidarbha kii rajkumaari indumati ke swayamvar main jaakar unhen apni patni banaaya
 Kalidasa has beautifully described this swayamvara in 'raghuvansh'
 raghu ne aj kaa raaj-kaushal dekhakar apana singhaasana unhen saunp diya or vanprastha le liya
 Like Raghu, Aja also became a skilled king
 ve apni patni indumati se bahut prem karte the
 Once Naradji was pleased and wandering in the sky with his veena
 sanyogvash unki vina kaa ek phool tutaa or bageeche main saiyr kar rahi rani indumati ke sir par gira jisase unki mrityu ho gai

 janata ke anadar kaa parinaam rajya kaa patan hota he or is prakaar ek pratapi vansh kii iti bhi ho jaati he
 Kalidas knew that the story of Rama had flourished from Valmiki's Ramayana, and whatever would be written after that would be confused
 isiilie unhone apane kavy main ram ko nayak banane kii bajaay raghuvansh ko hi kathanayake ke rup main prastut kiya; jisamen sabhi paatro kii apni-apni bhoomika rahi- apane-apane charitra ke aadhaar par xxrep 4
