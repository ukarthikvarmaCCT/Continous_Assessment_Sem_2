 Amarnath is a major pilgrimage center for Hindus
 yah kashmir rajya ke srinagar shahar ke uttar-purv main 135 sahastrameter dur samudratal se 13,600 foot kii oonchaai par sthit he
 The length of this cave is 19 meters and width is 16 meters
 gupha 11 meter unchi he
 The Amarnath cave is one of the major shrines of Lord Shiva
 amarnath ko tirthon kaa tirth kaha jaataa he kyon ki yaheen par bhagwaan shiv ne maan parvati ko amartv kaa rahasy bataaya tha
 The main feature of this place is the formation of natural Shivling in the cave in the snow
 prakritik him se nirmit hone ke kaaran ise swayambhu himani shivlinga bhi kehete hai
 Starting from Ashada Purnima till Rakshabandhan, lakhs of people come here for the holy Himling Darshan to be held throughout the month of Sawan
 gupha kii paridhi lagbhag dedh sau foot he or isamen upar se barf ke pani kii boonden jagah-jagah tapakati rahati hai
 There is a place here, in which a ten feet long Shivling is formed by dripping snow droplets
 chandramaa ke ghatane-badhane ke saath-saath is barf kaa aakaar bhi ghatata-badhata rahata he
 On Shravan Purnima it comes in its full size and gradually becomes smaller till Amavasya
 aashcharya kii baat yahi he ki yah shivlinga thos barf kaa bana hota he, jabaki gupha main aamtaur par kachi barf hi hoti he jo haath main lete hi bhurabhura jaae
 Ganesh, Bhairav and Parvati have similar icebergs several feet away from the original Amarnath Shivling
 janashruti prachlit he ki isi gupha main mata parvati ko bhagwaan shiv ne amarkatha sunai thi, jise sunakar sadyojaat shuk-shishu shukdev rishi ke rup main amar ho gayi the
 Even today, a pair of pigeons are seen in the cave, which the devotees call immortal birds
 ve bhi amarkatha sunakar amar hue hai
 There is also a belief that Shiva Parvati, who sees devotees who are associated with pigeons, provides salvation to that creature by taking a direct view of their visions
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv ne adrdhagini parvati ko is gupha main ek aisi katha sunai thi, jisamen amarnath kii yatra or uske maarg main aane vaale anek sthalon kaa varnan tha
 This story later became known as Amarkatha
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki bhagwaan shankar jab parvati ko amar katha sunaane le ja rahe the, to unhone chote-chote anant naagon ko anantnag main choda, maathe ke chandan ko chandanbari main utaara, anya pissuon ko pissu top par or gale ke sheshnag ko sheshnag naamak sthal par choda tha
 All these places still visit the Amarnath Yatra
 amarnath gupha kaa sabase pehle pataa solahavin shatabdi ke purvaadh main ek musalmaan gaderiye ko chalaa tha
 Even today a fourth offering is made to the descendants of that Muslim shepherd
 aashcharya kii baat yah he ki amarnath gupha ek nahin he
 While proceeding on the path of the river Amravati, many other small and large caves are seen
 ve sabhi barf se dhaki hai
 There are two ways to go on Amar Nath Yatra
 ek pahalgam hokar or doosraa sonmarg baltaal se
 That is, to reach Pahalman and Baltal by any ride, you have to use your feet to go further from here
 ashakt yaa vridhon ke liye savaariyon kaa prabandh kiya ja saktaa he
 The route from Pahalgam is considered to be simple and convenient
 baltaal se amarnath gupha kii duuri keval 14 kilometre he or yah bahut hi durgam rasta he or suraksha kii drushti se bhi sandigdh he
 That is why the government does not consider this route safe and motivates most of the travelers to go to Amarnath via Pahalgam
 lekin romaanch or jokhim lene kaa shauk rakhane vaale log is maarg se yatra karnaa pasand karte hai
 People traveling through this route travel at their own risk
 raste main kisi anhoni ke liye bharat sarkaar jimmedaari nahin leti he

 The pilgrims spend the first night here
 yahan raatri nivas ke liye camp lagaae jate hai
 The climb of the Pisu Valley begins on the second day
 kaha jaataa he ki pissu ghati par devataaon or rakshason ke bich ghamaasan ladaai hui jisamen rakshason kii haar hui
 This journey of the first phase along the banks of the river Lidder is not difficult
 chandanbari se aage isi nadi par barf kaa yah pul salaamat rahata he
 The next stop is at Sheshnag, 14 kilometers from Chandanbadi
 yah maarg khadi chadhaai vaala or khatarnaak he
 This is where flea basins are seen
 amarnath yatra main pissu ghati kaaphi jokhim bharaa sthal he
 The flea valley is 11,120 feet above sea level
 yatri sheshnag pahunch kar tazaadam hote hai
 There is a beautiful blue water lake between the ranges
 is jhil main jhankkar yah bhram ho uthta he ki kahin aasmaan to is jhil main nahin utar aayaa
 This lake is spread over one and a half kilometers in length
 kinvadantiyon ke mutabik sheshnag jhil main sheshnag kaa vaas he or choubees ghanton ke andar sheshnag ek baar jhil ke baahar darshan dete hai, lekin yah darshan khushnaseebon ko hi naseeb hote hai
 Pilgrims stay here for the night and start the third day journey from here
 sheshnag se panchatarani aath mile ke faasale par he
 The route has to cross the Beauvel Top and Mahagunas Pass, which are 13,500 feet and 14,500 feet in height respectively
 mahagunas chotii se panchatarani tak kaa sara rasta utraai kaa he
 This place is named Panchtarni due to five small streams flowing here
 yah sthaan chaaron taraf se pahaado kii oonchi-oonchi chotiyon se dhakaa he
 The cold is also more due to the height
 oxigen kii kami kii vajah se tirthayatriyon ko yahan suraksha ke intjaam karne padate hai
 Amarnath's cave remains only eight kilometers away from here and snow remains frozen on the way
 isi din gupha ke najadik pahunch kar padaav daal raat bitaa sakate hai or duusare din subah puja archana kar panchatarani lautaa ja saktaa he
 Some travelers reach Sheshnag by evening
 yah rasta kaaphi kathin he, lekin amarnath kii pavitra gupha main pahonchte hi safar kii sari thakaan pal bhar main chhu-mantar ho jaati he or adbhut atmik anand kii anubhuti hoti he

 In this, the social form of the decoration of the city, the behavior of the vagrants, the practice of slavery, the game of gambling, the slyness of wits, the chauvinism, the system of adjudication in the court, the maliciousness of the subjects towards the undesired king, and the dominance of public opinion
 
 saath hi samaaj main daridrajan kii sthiti, guniyon kaa sanman, sukh du:kha main samroop maitri ke bidarshan, upakrit varg kii kritagyata, nirparaadh ke prati dand par kshobh, raaj vallabhon ke atyaachaar, vaaranari kii samruddhi evam udaartaa, pranay kii vedi par balidaan, kulanganaon kaa adarsh charitra jaise vaiyaktik vishyon par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he

 hamen isamen chaaturvarnya kaa samaaj miltaa he – brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra
 The main work of the Brahmins was Purohitai, but they were also interested in the rule
 is katha main jo ek badi gambheer baat milti he vah yah he ki yahan brahman, vyapaaree or nimnavarna milakar madandh kshatriya rajya ko ukhaad phenkate hai
 It is worth noting
 or phir sochane kii baat yah he ki is katha kaa lekhak raja shudrak mana jaataa he jo kshatriyon main shreshth kaha gaya he
 There are ten digits in Mruthaktik, each number has multiple scenes

 With this, the political story of Aryak's statehood is also intertwined
 kritikar ne donon kathaon ko kushalta se joda he
 The play is broadly divided into two parts - first, the love affair of Vasantasena and Charudatta and the second, with the rebellion of Aryak attaining Rajpada
 pehla ank : is ank main yah katha he ki raja kaa saalaa shaakaar ujjayini kii prasiddh ganika vasantsena ko paanaa chahta he
 He pursues Vasantasena on a dark night with his two companions
 bhaybheet vasantsena charudatt ke ghar main shaaran leti he
 She leaves all her gold-clad as a heritage in Charudatta's house, telling her to escape the thieves
 doosraa ank : samvahak, jo pehle charudatt kii seva main tha, jue kii lat lagane par bahut sa dhan haar jaataa he
 He takes Sharan to the house of Vasantasena for rescue, who gives him a bracelet and makes him free
 vah buddha-bhikshu ban jaataa he
 Third issue: a Brahmin named Sharvilak loves Vasantasena's maid Madanika
 use daasatv se chhudaane ke liye vah ek raat charudatt ke ghar main send lagaakar vasantsena dwaara dharohar rakhe gaye sone ke saare aabhushan chura letaa he
 On the other hand, Chaudutt's paternal wife Dhuta gives her precious Ratnavali in exchange for stolen robes to save her husband from Loknanda, Chaudutt gives the Ratnavali and sends the clown Maitreya to Vasantasena's house
 chauthaa ank : sharvilak churaae hue aabhushan lekar madnika ko daasatv se mukt karaane ke liye vasantsena ke ghar pahunchataa he
 Madanika is very sad to hear about the theft
 is galati ko sudhaarney kii bhaavana se vah sharvilak ko yah samajhaati he ki chori ke aabhushan vasantsena ko saunp dene se na vah chor rahegaa, na charudatt ke sir par rin rahegaa or vasantsena ke aabhushan use vaapis mil jaayenge, sharvilak aisa hi karata he
 He tells Vasantasena that Charudatta has sent the message that we cannot keep the goldsmith safe by having a dilapidated house, so keep it with you
 vasantsena sandesh ke badale main kuch le jane kii baat kahkar madnika ko sharvilak ko saunp detii he
 In this issue, the clown meets Vasantasena and says that Swarnapatra has lost in gambling, so accept this Ratnavali
 vasantsena vaastaviktaa jaanati he, par kuch nahin karti
 She decides to come to Charudatta's house in the evening
 paanchavaan ank : is ank main varsha-ritu varnan hua he
 Vasantasena meets Charudatta and stays overnight at his house due to rain
 chatha ank : subah charudatt pushpkarndak udyaan main ghoomane jaataa he, vasantsena ke liye gaadi taiyaar rakhane kaa aadesh dekar taaki vah usamen udyaan tak yatra kar sake
 It is here that Vasantasena sees Chaudatta's son Rohsen insisting that he wants to play with a gold ball, not a clay car
 vasantsena saare aabhushan mitti kii gaadi main rakhkar kahati he ki isse sone kii gaadi bana lenaa
 Vasantasena comes out to meet Charudatta in the garden, but mistakenly sits in the car park standing at the same place
 udhar karagaar todakar, rakshak ko markar nikal bhaaga gwaale kaa betaa aryak, bachaav ke liye charudatt ke vaahan main chadh jaataa he
 On the way, two police soldiers - Veerak and Chandanak, also see the vehicle, but one of them lets Aryaak go by promising to protect him
 saatvaan ank : raja paalak ne sidhon kii bhavishyavaanee par vishwaas karke jis aryak naamak vyakti ko bandi bana liya tha, jab vah bandhan todakar bachataa hua charudatt kii gaadi main chadhakar udyaan main charudatt ke samaksh aata he or unase shaaran maangata he
 Charudatta gets him safely out of his car
 aathvaan ank : bhul se shaakaar kii gaadi main baithi vasantsena jab udyaan main pahunchati he to charudatt ke sthaan par dusht shaakaar se uskaa saamana hota he

 Number nine: Shakara makes Charudatta accused of killing Vasantasena
 nyaayalay main vivaad chalata he, charudatt swayan ko nirdosh sabit nahin kar paata
 Unhappy Charudatta waits for his friend Maitreya, who had gone to Vasantasena to return the jewelery that Vasantasena had given him to make a gold car instead of Rohsen's clay cart
 isi kshan vahi aabhushan lekar maitrey aa jaataa he
 But while talking to Maitreya, they fall in front of everyone holding the wall and it is believed that Chaudutt has killed Vasantasena in the greed of jewelery
 use mrityudand kaa aadesh dekar vadhasthal kii ore le jaaya jaataa he
 Tenth Issue: In this issue, one of the Shakara servants declares the perpetrator Charudatta innocent, but no one believes him
 duusare thik isi samay praan bachaane vaale buddha-bhikshu bane samvahak ke saath aakar vasantsena shaakaar kii dushtataa vyakt kar detii he or charudatt jhuthe aarope se mukt ho jaataa he
 Here the new king Aryak arrives in the kingdom, he not only gives the kingdom to the chargeless Charudatta, but also gives death penalty to Shakara due to false accusation
 kintu charudatt ke kehane par shaakaar ko bhi kshamaa kar diya jaataa he

 The play ends with these happy events
 mrichctic kii na keval kathavstu hi atyant rochak he, apitu kavi kii charitra chithran kii chaaturi bahut ucch koti kii he
 Though it has a predominant rasa vipralambha adornment, there is an easy harmony of the various juices of the heart like humor, compassion, terrible and vatsalya
 greek natyakala kii drushti se bhi parakhe jane par iskaa mulya paashchaatya manishiyon dwaara bahut unchaa aankaa gaya he
 Its language is endowed with prasad quality is extremely Pranjal
 praakrit ke vividh swaroopon kaa darshan isamen hota he- praacha, magadhi or shauraseni ke atirikt, sarvottam praakrit maharashtri or aavanti ke bhavy nidarshan yahan uplabdh hote hai
 According to Grierson, the use of takki Prakrit is also found in Shakari Vibhash in this case
 shabdachayan main maadhuri evam arthvyakti kii ore kavi ne savishesh dhyaan diya he, jisase aavanti evam vaidarbhi reeti kaa nirvaah purna rup se hua he
 There are two stories in Mrithaktik
 ek charudatt kii, duusari aryak kii
 The legend of Gunadhya tells the revolt of Gopal Darak Aryak
 brihatkatha apane mul rup main pashachi bhashaa main ‘baddkaha’ ke naam se likhi gai thi
 This shows that this play is of the first century AD or the second century AD
 yah naatak sanskrit sahitya main apana vishesh sthaan rakhata he
 in this- ye isaki visheshtaayen hai
 The political feature of this play is that it has been described as bad Kshatriya king
 gop-putr 'aryak' ek gwaala he, jise kavi raja banaata he
 Although the poet considers Varnashrama, he makes Gopa the king
 aisa lagata he ki yah moolkatha puraani he or sambhavtah yah ghatana koi vaastavik ghatana he jo kinvadanti main rah gai
 The depiction of slavery society is very beautiful and we find it in the time of Chanakya, when the word 'arya' is used as 'citizen'
 ho saktaa he, koi puraani kinvadanti chanakya ke baad ke samay main is katha main utar ai ho
 During the time of Buddha, the rise of traders was also considerable
 tab ujjayini kaa rajya alag tha, kosal kaa alag
 Ujjayini is also described here
 ek jagah lagata he ki us samay bhi bharat kii ekta kaa abhas tha, jab kaha gaya he ki 'sari prithvi aryak ne jeet lee' – vah prithvi jisaki kailas pataakaa he
 If seen, the poet was realistic and impartial
 usne sabaki achchhaayiyaan or buraaiyaan dikhaai hai or badi gaharaai se chithran kiya he
 This is the reason for his success
 yah maharaj shudrak kii kriti maani jaati he jo bhaas or kalidas kii bhaanti raaj kavi hue hai
 Mritchkatik AD can be said to be composed around the first century
 kaha jaataa he, bhasapranit 'charudutt' naamak chaturangi roopak kii kathavstu ko parivardhit kar kisi parvarti shudra kavi ke dwaara mrichctic kii rachana hui he
 In fact, the basis of its narrative is found in the stories narrated in Brihatkatha and Kathasaritsagara
 mrichctic’ kii katha kaa kendra he ujjayini
 He is such a big city that the conductor of Pataliputra comes to settle his fame and gain business after hearing his fame
 us samay vah patliputra ko mahanagar nahin kahata
 This means that Ujjayini was more important than Pataliputra at that time
 spasht hi patliputra buddha ke samay main patliputra tha, jabaki ujjayini main mahasen chand pradyot kaa samrudh rajya tha
 The second antiquity is that there is a lot of slavery in it
 das-daasi dhan dekar azaad kar liye jate the
 The courtesans also became brides in that society
 yah sab baaten aise samaaj kii hai, jahaan zyaada kadai nahin milti, jo baad main chaalu hui thi
 Rather, the poet has set a new ideal in the society by making the bride a bride
 usamen vidroh kii bhaavana he
 He kills the oppressor like an animal, elevates the woman and the slave frees the settler
 yon kah sakate hai ki yah naatak joki shastreey shabdon main prakaran he – bahut hi mahatvapurn he

 treepathi ji bhashaa evam sahitya donon ke gambheer anusandhitsu rahe hai
 His first book 'hindi Criticism' is unique in its field even today due to its originality, poignancy, honest expression and accurate and comprehensive analysis
 treepathi ji ne bahut nahin likhaa he, parantu jo bhi likhaa he, use padhate hue yah nibasancoch kaha ja saktaa he ki unki likhi har pankti atyadhik mahatvapurn or avashya dhyatavya he
 Tripathi ji has written one book each on the poetry of Tulsidas and Meera
 tulsidas ke sandarbh main acharya shukla se lekar da• ramvilas sharma ji tak ke vivechan ke baad kuch nayaa or sarthak jod paanaa nishchay hi ek badi chunauti jaisi baat he, jise treepathi ji ne bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 The form of poet Tulsi, which was created after his book was published, could not be made earlier
 or yah rup kitna pramanik tathaa hridaygrahi he, isaki jhalak is pustak par likhe gayi rajendra yadav ke patr se bahut acchhee tarah mil jaati he
 Despite all the earlier arguments, even Tulsidas, like Rajendra Yadav, who believed in the superstition, orthodoxy, immutability etc
 and Ram's character as a philanthropist and a Gilgile, also read this book that such a strange heat, intimacy and bind in the book Of course, i went on reading it
 acchhee baat yah lagi ki aapane na ram ko mukut pahanaae, na tulsi ko akshat chandan lagaae -- aapane to apane avadh ko hi tulsi ke madhyam se jiya he, vahaan ke logon, unke aapasi sambandhon or sandarbhon -- bina unhen mahimanveet kiye -- ko ukera he
 You have made everything so humane and vibrant that i left all my prejudices towards Tulsi and went on to study



 'mira kaa kavy' ke teen adhyyon main hi lekhak ne varnavyavastha, nari or bhakthi aandolan ke bahuaiami pariprekshya main 'mira' or uske 'giradhar nagar' ke sambandhon kii -- atyadhik varjana yukt samaaj main -- yathasambhav abhivyakti ke madhyam se yathasthiti tathaa saamaajik gati kii dwandvatmakataa kii kaavyatmakataa kaa jo nirupan kiya he, use 'anupam' kahkar bhi uskaa mahatva rekhaankit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It can be known only by reading

 Just have to start
 phir to treepathi ji kii samarth parantu sahaj paardarshee bhashaa-style apni svachh nirjhar kii swaabhaavik vegamayi dhara main bahaaye liye chali jaati he
 Most of the writing of Tripathi ji is related to his time and society
 chaahe vah parasaai ke vyangy nibandhon kii vivechna ho yaa kedarnath agarwal kii kavitaaon ke marm kaa udghaatan; kahani par kendrit kahani-aalochana ke ucchtam seemaant ko sparsh karne vaali donon pustaken hon yaa sansmaran-jeevani kaa bahuaiami-bahurangi sansar -- treepathi ji kaa lakshya praayah vichlan kii har binduon ko pahachaanate hue, usase bachakar tathaa lakshith lekhakon ke bachane yaa batch paane kii koshish kii prakriya ko samajhate-samajhaate samaaj ko sahi gati se upyukt disha main agrasar kar sakane vaali mukammal drushti kii sateek pahchaan hi he
 For this, Tripathi has neither resorted to polymics nor accepted any factionalism
 acharya hajariprasad dvivedi ke antevasi tathaa priypaatr rahete hue bhi, unka kuch muddon par prakhar virodh karne vaale ramvilas sharma se bhi -- unki aseem sambhaavnaaon, tathaa ugantarkari srujankaryon ke kaaran -- lagaataar hardik rup se jude rahe; tathaa sharma ji ke prati nirantar aadar prakat karte hue bhi unke virodh kaa koi mauka na ganvaane vaale namvar ji ke prati bhi unki adamya jigyaasaaon ke kaaran bahupathaniyata se bahumukhi jaankariyon, sahitya kii sateek pahchaan tathaa aalochana ke 'sachal vishvavidhyalayan rup' ke kaaran hameshaa hardik lagaav banaaye hi rahe hai
 Otherwise, how long and how much the relationship of the teacher-disciple or cooperation-cooperation and friendship is still in today's age! hindi kahani-aalochana ke kshetra main surendra choudhary ke baad ni:sandeh da• vishwanath treepathi dwitiya shikhar aalochak hai
 Like Surendra Chaudhary, Tripathi ji has not written much, and has not taken any single round or even a storyteller in its entirety for deliberation
 unhone unheen kahaniyon par likhaa he, jisane apni rachanaatmak samarthy ke kaaran unase likhva liya he
 This is a limitation from one point of view, so for the same reason, writing has become possible, which is unique in many ways
 jab treepathi ji kii kahani-aalochana kii pehali pustak 'kuch kahaniyaan : kuch vichaar' prakashit hui thi to pustak-samikshakon dwaara ukt seemaa par jor dekar 'simaaon main bandhi aalochana' ke rup main kuch prashansa, kuch ninda kii bahuprachlit paddati ke tahat hi samiksha kii gayi thi
 It is natural that most of the Hindi readers who read the book after seeing the review were deprived of the book for a long time, then how would they have become familiar with the feature! While Dr
 Namwar Singh himself has a clear statement about this book, the book 'some Stories: Some Thoughts' is a very serious and very important book written on the story
 usamen amarkaant par, fanishwarnath renu par, shaani par, shekhar joshi par, gyanaranjan par itnaa acha likhaa he ki maine kahin or dekha nahin, main khud nahin likh sakaa
 i cannot even write, i will also tell this

 His book Vyomkesh Darvesh written as 'acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi's virtuous remembrance' is virtually a biography of Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi

 An additional feature of this book is that under the title 'composition and creator', there are also collected critical articles written by Tripathi on Dwivedi ji
 is khand ko da• namvar singh dvivedi ji par likhi gayi aalochanaon main adwitiya maanate hai; tathaa puri pustak ko manager pandeya ek shandaar jeevani ke saath-saath treepathi ji kii aalochanatmak kshamta kaa pramaan bhi maanate hai

 The history of Kannada literature is about one and a half thousand years old
 kuch saahitiyik kritiyaan jo 9veen shatabdi main rachi gayin thim, ab bhi surakshit hai
 Kannada literature is mainly divided into three literary periods - ancient period, medieval period and modern period
 kannada sahitya kii ek vishesh baat yah he ki isamen jain, virshaiv or vaishnav teenon samradaayon ne sahitya rachana kii jisase madhyakaal main teen spasht dharaayen dikhti hai
 Although much of the literature before the 18th century was religious, some non-communal literature was also composed
 kannada sahitya ke itihaas par jitne chote-bade granth rache gaye hai unamem mukhya nimnlikhit hai : In these histories, the history of Kannada literature has been divided on different grounds
 kisi ne 12veen shatabdi ke madhyakaal tak jain yug, 12veen shatabdi ke madhyabhaag se 15veen shatee ke madhyabhaag tak "virshaiv yug", 15 veen shatabdi ke madhyabhaag se 19veen shatabdi ke purvardh tak "brahman yug" or uske baad ke kaal ko aadhunik yug mana he; or kisi vidvan ke anusaar aarambhkaal 10veen shatabdi tak, dharm-prabalya-kaal, ragale, shatpadi evam navinkal kaha he
 It can be said with certainty that in the annals of Kannada literature written so far, Dr

 Therefore, it can be said that the time division of Mughal is most valid which is as follows: pro mughali ne prayek yug ke sarvaadhik pratibhasampann kavi ke naam se us yug kaa namakaran karte hue mote taur par saare sahitya ko maarg yug, sankraman yug, deshi yug ke rup main vibhajit kiya he

 Kaviraj Marg is a very important book in terms of Kannada language, Kannada literature, Kannada region, culture of the people of Karnataka, etc
 is kaal kaa doosraa granth he "vaddaradhane" jisamen 19 jain mahapurushon kii kahaniyaan gadhy main nirupit hai
 In relation to its author and composition, it is believed that a Jain poet named Shivkotayacharya composed it between 900-1070
 yah praakrit ke "bhagavatiaradhana" naamak granth ke aadhaar par rachaa gaya he or isamen uttam kavy ke gun milte hai
 The greatest importance of this book is that it gets the first form of Kannada prose
 uparyukt do granthon ke atirikt ab tak is kaal kaa anya koi granth uplabdh nahin hua he
 The period of the pump is particularly important in the history of Kannada literature, which is also known as the "golden Age"
 is kaal kaa doosraa naam he "jain yug", kyonki is avadhi main kannada sahitya kii shrivriddhi karanevaalon main jain mataavlambee kaviyon kaa vishesh haath rahaa
 Each of these Jain poets primarily composed two types of poetry - a Jain religious poem or an object of religious poetry was the story of a Tirthankara or great man, and cosmic poetry depicts the stories of mythological poems
 is prakaar do-do granth rachane kaa uddeshy ek or jain dharm ke tatwon kaa prachaar karnaa tha or duusari ore sanskrit ke lokapriy mahakavyon kaa kannada main praturup prastut karke logon ko apane dharm kii ore aakarshith karnaa tha
 These Jain poets were scholars of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages, were penetrating literature and were also talented poets
 in kaviyon ne aavashyak parivartan ke saath puranic kathankon ko apane dharm ke anukool avashya banaaya, kintu unki moulikta ko nasht na hone dekar rochakata ko banaae rakhaa
 The Kannada language and literature were greatly favored by the writings of Jain poets
 is avadhi main champu kavyastylee kaa vishesh prachaar hua
 In the religious poems of this time, the heroic and the rasad rasas were particularly expressive in the wonderful and quiet and temporal poems
 uparyukt do prakaar ke kaavyon ke atirikt chand, ras, alankaar, vyakaran, kosh, jyotish, vaidyak aadi vibhinn vishyon par bhi granth likhe gaye
 In this era, Kannada literature progressed as a whole
 is yug ke prasiddh kavi teen the–pump, ponn tathaa rann jo "rannatrayee" ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The Mahakavi pump or Adi pump composed two poems - "adipuran" and "vikramarajunvijay" or "pump India"
 adipurana main jinsenacharyakrit sanskrit purvapurana ke aadhaar par pratham tirthakar vrishabhnath kaa jeevancharit chitrit kiya gaya he or "vikramarjunvijay" main mahabharat ke kathanak kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Both of these are Champukavya
 pump kannada ke adikavi maane jate hai
 Their time is believed to be around 941 CE
 ponn pump ke samakaleen the
 He composed three texts - "shantipuran", "jinaksharamala" and "bhuvanaikaramabhyudaya"
 antim granth uplabdh nahin he
 Ranna's main compositions are two - "ajitpuran" and "sahas Bhimavijay" or "gadayudha"
 gadayuddh ke nayak bhim hai
 There is a unique euphemism of Veeras in Gadayudh
 isi kavy se rann kii rkiti achal hui he
 Other poets of the pump era include the names of Choundarai, Nagavarma, Durgasingh, Chandraraj, Nagachandra, Nagavarma etc
 choundary kaa "choundrayuparan" pracheen kannada gadhy kaa sundar namoona he
 Two texts of Nagavarma i have been received - "karnataka Kandabari" and "chhandombudhi"
 "karnatakakadambari" baan kii kadambari kaa kannada praturup he
 It is in the Champo style
 pro mughali kaa mat he ki kannada main anudit jitne granth hai unamem nagvarm kii karnatakakadambari sarvshereshth he–chandraraj or shridharacharya nagvarm ke samakaleen kavi hai
 Chandraraja's treatise on Madrasatilak and Madhutilak's astrological treatise called "jatakatilak" are both masterpieces
 isi kaal main durgasingh ne, jo bhagwat sampradaay ke kavi the, sanskrit "panchatantr" kaa anuwaad prastut kiya
 Between the 11th and 12th centuries another famous poet was named Nagachandra
 kyonki inhone panpabharat se prerana paakar ramayana kii rachana kii, isliye inkaa doosraa naam "abhinav pump" padaa
 Nagchandra also composed two poems like the earlier Jain poets - "mallinathpuran" and "ramachandrachitrapuran" or "pamparamayan"
 panparamayana hi kannada ke uplabdh ramakatha sambandhi kaavyon main sabase pracheen he
 The Mahakavis emerged in Pampyuga and enriched Kannada with their great works
 yadhyapi is kaal main bade-bade kalatmak praudh kaavyon kaa nirmaan hua, to bhi samaaj ke saadhaaran logon ke jivan ke saath sahitya kaa sampark nahin tha
 The main reason for this was that the poets of this time lived in the shelter of the kings and whatever they used to write, either to sing the fame of their shelter kings or to get the applause among other pundits of the court or their religion
 To promote
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki bolchaal kii bhashaa sahitya sarjan ke liye upyukt nahin samajhi gai
 Sanskrit was influenced everywhere
 champu style main jo praudh kavy rache gaye ve saadhaaran janata kii vastu na hokar panditon tak simit rahe
 The period from late 12th century to 15th century is called Basava era
 is yug kaa doosraa naam "krantiyug" he
 At this time, there was no such area in Karnataka, religious, social or political, which could remain untouched by the revolution
 is kranti ke unnayak basav, basavann athwa basaweshwar the, iliye is yug kaa naam basav yug padaa
 In this period, the above-mentioned Kannada literature was devised in place of Sanskritist Kannada and native verses were given special encouragement in lieu of Sanskrit poetry
 pichhali shatabdiyon main jain mataavalambiyon kaa sahityakshetra main sarvadhikaar tha
 In this era, different opinions contributed to the creation of literature
 sahitya kii shrivriddhi main bhakthi ek prabal prerak shakti ke rup main sahaayak hui
 Basaveshwara emerged in the second half of the 12th century
 unhone virshaiv mat kaa pun: sanghatan karke karnataka ke dharmik evam saamaajik jivan main badi uthal puthal machaai
 Basava and his followers used colloquial Kannada as a medium for propagating their views
 virshaiv bhakton ne bhakthi, gyaan, vairaygy, sadachaar evam niti par niraadambar style main apane anubhavon kii baaten sunai, jo vachan sahitya ke naam se prasiddh hui
 The words of these Veerashaiva devotees or Shiva Sharan are a type of prose
 shivasharanon ne sahitya ke liye sahitya nahin rachaa
 His main objective was to propagate his ideas
 unke vichaaron main saralata thi, sachaai thi or sachche jigyaasu kii rasmagnata tha
 Therefore, literary eloquence in his speech came automatically
 in shivasharanon ke vachanon ne karnataka main vahi kaary kiya jo kabir tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne uttar bharat main kiya
 Basava preached devotion and in the practice of this devotion, Vedic rituals, idolatry, discrimination of caste lines, avatarism, blind faith etc
 were hindered
 jatirahit, varnarahit, vargrahit samaaj ke nirmaan dwaara unhone aadhyatmik saadhan kaa maarg sarvasulabh bananaa chaha
 Among the contemporary Veerashaiva devotees of Basava are Allamprabhu, Akkamahadevi, chennai-bansava and Siddharam
 in vachanakaar shivasharanon ke atirikt virshaiv mataavlambee bahut se aise kavi hue jinhone bhakthibhavpradhan naanaa prakaar ke kavyagranth deshi chhandon kaa prayog karte hue prastut kiye
 The three best poets between the 12th and 13th centuries were Harihara, Raghavanka and Padmasaras
 is kaal ke jain kaviyon main nemichandra, bandhuvarma, jann, mallikarjun, keshiraj, rattakavi or kumudendu muni ke naam ullekhneey hai
 In the 13th century, the religious situation of Karnataka was again in turmoil
 ek ore karnataka ramanujacharya dwaara sthapit shrivaishnav sampradaay se prabhavit hua or duusari ore usamen madhwacharya ke dwait mat kii bhakthi kii nai lahar chali
 The Bhaktidhara run by these two Vaishnava sects brought new power to Kannada literature
 parinamswaroop puranic mahakavyon ke kathankon kaa kannada main nae sire se vishuddh mul rup main nirupan hua
 During this period, there was a Vaishnava poet named Rudrabhatta whose "jagannathvijay" is considered to be the first Vaishnav manag poetry of Kannada
 yah champu style main likhaa gaya he or isaki kathavstu krishna se sambandhit he
 The period from the 15th century to the end of the 19th century is called the Kumaravayas era
 is avadhi main vijaynagar ke samraaton tathaa mysore ke raajaaon ne kannada sahitya kii shrivriddhi main vishesh haath bantaya
 The reputation of Vaishnavism grew, whose response was also reflected in Kannada literature
 vaishnav dharm dwaara prachaarit bhakthi sahityasarjan main prerak shakti ke rup main prakat hui
 Literature came in very close contact with the public
 is kaal ke sarvshereshth kavi narnapp hai jo apni lokapriyata ke kaaran "kumarvyas" ke abhidhaan se prakhyat hue
 Kumaravas was the principal poet of the Bhagavata sect
 narnapp athwa kumarvyas kii janmatithi, janmasthan tathaa unke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 According to Prof
 Mughali, Kumaravas were alive between the 14th and 15th centuries
 kumarvyas ne "kannada bharat" athwa "gadugin bharat" or "airavat" naamak do kavy likhe the, aisa mana jaataa he
 But doubts have been expressed about Airavat being his masterpiece
 "kannada bharat" main vyasarchit mahabharat ke pratham das parvo kii katha kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Although Pampa had presented a Kannada model of the whole story of the Mahabharata through his "pampaharata", it could not become as popular as the Kannada Bharata of Kumaravayas
 iske do kaaran hai– ek yah he ki panpabharat main paandityapradarshan kii pravriti adhik thi or doosraa yah ki usamen jain dharm kaa rang bhi chadha tha
 After the kannada-bharata of Kumaravayas, many of the best poems were presented in the Shaktadi style based on the stories of Mahabharata, Ramayana and Bhagavata
 kumarvyas ke dikhalaae hue maarg par chalakar narhari athwa kumaravalmiki naamak kavi ne valmiki ramayana ke aadhaar par kannada main "torveramayana" kii rachana kii
 It is also a devotional treatise poem, which is a succulent artwork of ancient Kannada
 bhagwat mataavlambee kaviyon main timmann kavi, chatu vitthalanath, lakshmish tathaa nagaras ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Inspired by the Kumaravyas, the Timman poet described the story of the last eight festivals of the Mahabharata in his poem titled "krishnaraja Bharat"
 sabase pehle samgr bhagwat kaa kannada padyanuwaad chatu vitathalanath naamak bhagwat kavi ne prastut kiya
 Around this period, there was a very talented poet whose name was Lakshmish
 inkaa likhaa hua "jaiminibharat" anupam kavy he jisamen mahabharat ke katipay rochak prasangon kaa sundar evam marmasparshi varnan kiya gaya he
 Jaminibharat is the place in Karnataka after Kumaravyas India in terms of popularity
 nagaras naamak kavi ne bhagavadgita kaa "vasudevakthamritasar" naamak kannada padyanuwaad prastut kiya
 Just as the poets of the Bhagavata sect like Kumaravayas, Kumaravalmiki, Lakshmish practiced devotional management poems in Kannada by taking narratives from epics like Bharat, Ramayana, Bhagavata, similarly Madhavamatavali devotees colloquially composed songs, hymns, kirtans in Kannada The message of devotion was brought home to Karnataka
 in bhakton kii parampara kaa aarambh 13veen shatabdi main narharitirth dwaara hua tha
 At this time a large congregation of these devotees had gathered, which was mainly divided into two parts
 ek dal kaa naam tha "vyasakut" or duusare kaa "daskut"
 The difference between these two was that they were called Bhakt Vyasakutas who were mostly Brahmins and who considered Sanskrit suitable for the expression of their thoughts, and they were considered as Bhakta Daskut which included people of all castes and those who were Kannada Through bhajans, kirtans were composed
 sampradaay kii tatv sambandhi baton main "vyasakut" tathaa "daskut" ke bhakton main koi antar nahin tha
 Devotees of both these parties are famous in Karnataka as Haridas

 "hadivadeydharm" honnamma kaa ek sundar kavy he jisamen satidharm kaa pranjal bhashaa main varnan kiya gaya he
 The essence of Sankara's Advaita doctrine is presented in Saras Kannada in the "anubhavamrita" written by the Mahalingrang poet
 chikadevaraay swayan achche kavi the
 In this era, Veerashaiva Mtavlabi devotees and poets also served Kannada by creating various types of texts
 inamen kuch shatak style main likhe gaye hai
 Apart from the verse style, some prose texts were also written and verses like sangatya, tripadi, circle, champoo, song etc
 were specially used
 kintu is lambii avadhi main jitne vachanakaar hue ve ine gine hi hai
 Among the Veerashaiva poets who presented the Charitakavya were Chamaras, Virupaksha Pandits and Conspiracy Deities
 chamras ke likhe kaavyon main "prabhulingalile" shreshth charitkavy he
 Alluvum Prabhu's biography is expanded in "prabhulingalele"
 virshaiv kaviyon main shreshth prabandh kavy rachnewaalon main harihar ke baad chamras kaa naam aadar ke saath liya jaataa he
 The Chenabasava Purana written by Virupaksha Pandit is also an excellent poem, telling the story of the famous Veerashaiva devotee Chennasab
 harihar ke "basavarajragale" tathaa chamras ke "prabhulingalile" jaise charitakaavyon main matdharm tathaa kavyadharm kaa jaisaa sundar samanvay hua he, vaisaa "chennabasavpurana" main nahin ho paaya he
 In the Pampa era, Jain poets made champu style very popular in Kannada through their best management poems
 lekin aage chalakar is style kaa upyog kam hota gaya
 This style was adopted again in the Kumaravayas era
 ise apnaanevaale kavi jain nahin apitu virshaiv the
 In the second half of the 17th century, a talented Veerashaiva poet named Chaitakshadeva composed three poems in the Champu style named "rajashekharvilas", "shabarshankarvilas", and "vrishabendravijay"
 "rajasekharvilas" tathaa "shabarshankarvilas", main shivlila se sambandh rakhanevaali kahaniyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The story of "vrishabendravijay" is the biography of Basava

 It is the specialty of his prose that along with the maturity and sweetness of ancient Kannada, the simplicity of modern Kannada is introduced
 bhartiya jivan ke itihaas main 19veen shatee kaa uttarardh atyant mahatvapurn he
 Since the whole of Indian life was disturbed and agitated by similar circumstances and influences at this time, it can be said that the story of the activity of modern Kannada literature is not different from the story of literature in other regional languages
 aadhunik kannada sahitya ko pradhanthya chaar bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he jo is prakaar hai: The first rise of modern Kannada begins with prose, in which the service of Christian missionaries is notable
