 David Ricardo was a British political economist
 david ricardo ek prabhaavshaalee shastreey arthshaastri the
 He started his professional life as a broker and financial market speculator
 unhone kaaphi nijee bhagya praapt kii, bade paimaane par vittiya bazaar kii atakalon se or, sevanivrutt hone par britain kii sansad main unhone ek seat kharida
 He held his parliamentary seat in the last four years of his life
 shaayad unki sabase mahatvapurn viraasat he unki tulanaatmak laabh ke siddhant jo yah bataata he ki ek raashtra ko keval unhi udyogon main dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie jahaan vah sabase adhik antarrashtriya str par pratispardhi he or anya deshon ke saath vyapaar kare ve utpaadon ko praapt karne ke liye jo unke raashtra me utpaadan nahin kar rahe
 In short, Ricardo promoted the idea of extreme industry expertise by countries
 is soch main ricardo ne ek rashtriya udyog niti ke astitv ko maan liya tha jiskaa uddeshy tha dusro kii haani ke liye kuch udyogon ko badhaava dene kaa
 Many scholars, such as Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa, have challenged Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, but remain the cornerstone in the argument for international free trade
 ricardo landan, england main paidaa hua tha
 He was the third of 17 children from a Jewish family of Portuguese descent
 unke pita, ibrahim ricardo, ek safal share dalal the
 He started working with his father at the age of 14
 21 saal kii umr main ricardo, ek quekar, prisilla eni wilkinson ke saath bhaag gai, or apane pita kii ichha ke viruddh he, vah ek isai ekajute ban gai
 This religious difference led to his estrangement from his family and he was forced to adopt a position of independence
 apane pita se uskaa manmutav ke baad vah Lubbocks or Forster, ek prakhyat banking ghar ke samarthan ke saath ek dalal ke rup main ek safal vyavsaay shuru kar diya
 Ten years after retiring and four years after entering Parliament, Ricardo died of an ear infection
 yah kaan kaa sankraman, mastishk main fail gaya or septicemia prerit kiya
 He was 51
 unke aath bachche the, jinme se teen bete the

 "at the time of his death his wealth was estimated to be £ 600,000

 He wrote his first economics article at the age of 37
 ricardo ke vichaar england main sweekaar ho gaye or aadhunik pashchimi duniya main roodhiwaadee aarthik vichaare ban gaye hai jahaan sarkaar aarthik vikaas main ek nirdhaaran bhoomika nibhaati he
 Between 1500 and 1750 more economists advocated mercantilism that promoted the idea of international trade for the purpose of obtaining bullion by driving a trade surplus with other countries
 ricardo ne is vichaar ko chunauti di ki vyapaar kaa uddeshy sona yaa chaandi jamaa karne ke liye maatr tha
 Ricardo was in favor of industry expertise and free trade
 unhone saral ganit kaa upyog karte hue sabit karne kaa prayaas kiya ki ni: shulk antarrashtriya vyapaar ke saath sanyukt udyog visheshgyata hameshaa sakaaratmak parinaam kaa utpaadan karata he
 This theory expanded on the concept of absolute profit
 ricardo ne yah tark diya ki vyapaar se aapasi rashtriya laabh he bhale hi ek desh apni vyapaarik samakaksh se har kshetra main zyada adhik pratispardhi he or ek raashtra ko keval un udyogon par dhyaan dena chahie jahaan unka ek tulanaatmak laabh tha
 Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage assumes the existence of industry and trade policy at a national level
 yah anumaan nahin karata ki vyapaar nirnay vyavhaaryata yaa laabh ke aadhaar par udhyamiyon dwaara swatantra rup se kiya janaa chahie
 Ricardo, using a simple numerical example, tried to prove that international trade is always beneficial
 paul samuelson ne ricardo ke england or portugal ke bich vyapaar kii sankhyatmak udhaaharan main prayukt sankhya ko "chaar jaadui sankhya" kaa naam diya
 Like Adam Smith, Ricardo was an opponent of protectionism for national economies, particularly agriculture
 ricardo kaa sabase prasiddh kaam 'raajnneetik arthvyavastha or karadhaan ke siddhant' he
 The first chapter of this opens with a statement of the labor theory of value
 unke mulya kaa shram siddhant ke liye kai manyataon kii aavashyaktaa he: 1
 Both regions have the same wage rate and the same rate of benefits; 2
 Capital employed in production is made up of wages only; 3
 The duration of production is the same for both goods
 ricardo khud ko yah ehsaas hua ki doosraa or teesraa manyataye kaaphi avastavik the or isliye apane mulya ke shram siddhant me do apwaad bhartee karaayaa: 1
 Production period may vary; 2
 In two production processes, instruments and equipment can serve as capital and not just as wages, and in very different proportions
 ricardo ne apane jivan ke ant tak apane mulya ke siddhant par kaam karnaa jari rakhaa
 David Ricardo's ideas had a tremendous impact on the new developments in economics
 american arthshaastriyon ne ricardo ko adam smith ke peeche, purv beesvin sadi kaa doosraa sabase prabhaavshaalee aarthik vichaarak kaa rank diya he
 Ricardo became the theoretical father of classical political economy

 But in 23 he moved to Nagpur and started working as a correspondent in political papers there
 usee varsh inhen giraftaar kar liya gaya or teen maah ke baad chhot gaye

 Zainendra was a unique explorer of his path
 unhone premachand ke saamaajik yatharth ke maarg ko nahin apanaaya, jo apane samay kaa rajmarg tha
 But he was not the antonym of Premchand, as many critics have proved; He was a complement to Premchand
 premachand or jainendra ko saath-saath rakhkar hi jivan or itihaas ko uski samagrata ke saath samajha ja saktaa he
 Jainendra's greatest contribution was in the creation of Hindi prose
 bhashaa ke str par jainendra dwaara kii gai tod-phod ne hindi ko taraashne kaa abhootpurv kaam kiya
 The prose of the unknowable would not have been possible if Jainendra's prose were not there
 hindi kahani ne prayogshiltaa kaa pehla paath jainendra se hi siikhaa
 Zainendra gave Hindi a transparent language and break, gave a new tone, a new `syntax '
 aaj ke hindi gadhy par jainendra kii amit chhap he
 - Ravindra Kalia has come out of the inclusion of philosophical and metaphysical elements in almost all the novels of Zainendra, but wherever these elements are included in the novels, they seem to create a difference of characters
 yahi kaaran he ki janendra ke paatr bahya vaataavaran or paristhitiyon se aprabhavit lagate hai or apni antarmukhi gatiyon se sanchalit
 Their reactions and behavior are also often in line with these motions
 isi kaa ek parinaam yah bhi hua he ki janendra ke upanyaason main charitron kii bharmaar nahin dikhaai detii
 The lack of characters has also led to the prominence of individual elements in Zainendra's novels
 krantikarita tathaa aatankvadita ke tatv bhi janendra ke upanyaason ke mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 The leading male characters in all his novels believe in a strong revolution
 bahya swabhaav, ruchi or vyavhaar main ek prakaar kii komalta or bhirutha kii bhaavana liye hokar bhi ye apane antar main mahaan vidhvansak hote hai
 This subversive personality of hers is created as a result of her reaction to the romantic disapproval of the woman
 isi kaaran jab ve kisi nari kaa thodaa bhi aashray, sahanubhuti yaa prem pate hai, tab tuutakar gir padate hai or tabhi unka bahya swabhaav komal ban jaataa he
 Janendra's female characters are often prominent in the novel
 upanyaaskaar ne apane nari paatro ke charitra-chithran main sookshm manovaigyanik drushti kaa parichay diya he
 Jainendra has been able to credibly mark the diverse forms of women, her abilities and reactions
 'sunita', 'tyaagptr' tathaa 'sukhada' aadi upanyaason main aise anek avasar aae hai, jab unke nari charitra bheeshan maansik sangharsh kii sthiti se guzare hai
 The feeling of incompleteness and interdependence of woman and man is the basic basis of this struggle
 vah apane prati purush ke aakarshan ko samajhati he, samarpan ke liye prastut rahati he or poorak bhaavana kii is kshamta se aalhadit hoti he, parantu kabhi-kabhi jab vah purush main is aakarshan moh kaa abhaav dekhati he, tab kshubdh hoti he, vyathit hoti he
 In the same way, when it comes to expectation of harshness from a man, it also becomes unbearable

 Halina Blavatsky was the founder of Theosophy and Theosophical Society
 bharat main antarrashtriya theosophical socity kaa mukhyalay sthapit karke ham bharatiyon ko gauravanvit karne vaali madam blawatski adhik din bharat main nahin raheen
 She came to India for the first time in 1852 during her world tour and stayed here for a few days and became aware of the richness of its sage tradition, Brahm Gyan
 1855 ke disambar main, japan se vaapasi par 1855 se 1857 ke madhya unhone dubaara bharat aakar adhik samay tak puure desh kaa bhraman karke yahaan kii aadhyatmik oonchaaiyon evam dharmagranthon ke bare main jaankaree praapt kii thi
 For the third time in 1868, she came to India and Tibet at the ripe age of 37, then learned more about India by exchanging ideas and studying from the scholars here a few days
 phir yahaan se tibet chali gayi
 After forming the Theosophical Society in New York on 8 September 1875, she came to India for the fourth time in late 1878, establishing the office of the Society in Bombay with her colleague Colonel Allcott and publishing a magazine called 'the Theosophite'

 32 varshon tak saare vishwa kaa bhraman karke unhone bharat ko hi theosophical socity kaa mukhya centre banane ke liye apane manonukool upyukt paaya
 This is a vivid proof of his assessment of India and his devotion to India
 ek vishwavyaapee sanghathan banane ke liye saare vishwa kaa bhraman param aavashyak hone ke kaaran unhone bharat main adhik samay tak na rahakar 32 varsh vishwa bhraman main bitaayaa tha
 Yet in total she lived in India for about 10 years

 After working in many countries there, she reached London and from there left in October of 1884 and returned to Adyar on 21 December
 1885 ke aarambh main ve bahut biimaar ho gayi
 In February, he had to leave India for treatment and work in Europe

 He made London his last stop, furthering the work of the Theosophical Society in Europe
 vahaan ‘blawatski loj’ naam se apana awaas bana kar, 1857 ke sitambar se unhone apana doosraa masik patr ‘lusifer’ kaa prakaashan shuru kar diya
 In 1888, his 1500-page treatise titled 'the Secret Doctin' was published from London
 1889 main unhone ‘da wois of silence’ tathaa ‘di kii tu theosophy’ naamak do pustaken prakashit kin
 During that period, the work of publicity of the Society continued
 8 may 1891 ko madam helina blawatski ne landan main antim saans leen
 Before his death, he established the Europe headquarters of the Society in 1990 at 19 Avenue Road, London, and in 1888 started an idea center of his esoteric learning under the name 'isoteric School'

 Halina Petrovna was born on 12 August 1831 in Ekaterin Slav, Ukraine, South Russia, in the family of Colonel Peter Vanhahn, an eminent Russian army officer

 So she grew up as a child under the supervision of her maternal grandfather Privy Councilor adre-di-fadeyev and her grandmother Princess Halina Pavlovna Dolgorukov

 He loved his mother and daughter
 or use khush rakhte the
 When the daughter expressed her wish that she would never again be in a marriage
 ab vah apane manonukool aadhyatm chintan va apane main brahmagyaan kaa vikaas karegi
 And will discover and study the latent esoteric mysteries of the universe, then the father had to allow it
 aarthik samasya unki putree ke aage thi nahin kyonki pita kii iklauti putree hone ke naate pita kii sampatti uske liye yathesht thi jisase vah aaajeevan apana nirvaah kar sakati thim
 One thing to aim at about Madame Blavatsky's outstanding character is that she considered marriage to be an accomplice as a husband and wife to serve a lofty purpose, not merely as a means of lust
 vivaah karke unhone dekha ki ‘brahmagyaan ke arjan tathaa brahmad ke gudh rahasyon kaa uddhatan karne or sansar main vishwa- bandhutav kaayam karne ke unke uddeshyon ko unke pati blawatski koi mahatva nahin dete
 They consider the wife only as a means of supply of lust and partner in their luxurious life
 ’ isliye helina vivaah ke turant baad pati se alag ho gayi, kintu unhone apane naam ke saath pati kaa naam apane jivan kii antim ghadi tak barkaraar rakhaa kyonki unhone apana doosraa vivaah karne ke uddeshy se apane pati se sambandh viched nahin kiya tha
 Once who became a husband, he remained her husband even when there was no relationship

 This first module has five subsystems: sanrachanaatmak upatantr, atyadhik taapmaana parivartan or sookshm ulka nuksaan se yantric aadhaar sanrachana, dhaalein upgrah pradaan karata he or upgrah ke spin kaaryon ko niyantrit karata he
 The telemetry subsystem monitors the operation of the on-board equipment and transfers the equipment operation data to the earth station control and commands the control station on the earth to make equipment operation adjustments
 shakti upatantr, saura panelon kii or bydaree byaap jo kii upgrah ke dharti kii chaaya se nikalne par urja paidaa karata he, se bana hota he
 The thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme sunlight-caused extreme temperatures or the lack of sun on different sides of the satellite
 is ravaiye or kaksha ko niyantrit karne ke upatantr chote rocket thrusters se bane hote hai, jo upgrah ko sahi kakshiya sthiti main rakhane or sahi disha main antena pojishning rakhte he
 The second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders
 ek transponder sakasham he: The list includes countries of independent capability to launch satellites in orbit, including the production of the necessary launch vehicle
 note: bahut se deshon upgrahon ko dizin karne or banane kii kshamta he - jinhen apekshaakrit, zyada vaigyanik, aarthik or audyogic kshamta kii aavashyaktaa nahin he - lekin unhen laanch karne main asamarth hai or videshi laanch sevaaon par nirbhar hai
 This list does not include countries, but includes those capable of launching satellites and the date on which this capability was first demonstrated
 sangheey upgrahon yaa bahu rashtriya upgrahon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Both North Korea and Iraq have claimed orbit launches, but these claims remain unconfirmed
 uparokt, deshon ke atirikt anya deshon jaise dakshin africa, spain, italy, pashchimi germany, canada, australia, argentina, ejipt or nijee companiyaan jaise otrag, ne apane prakshepanon kaa vikaas kiya he, par safaltaapurvak prakshepan nahi kar paae hai
 As of 2008, only seven countries out of the above list (ukraine, United States, Japan, China, India and Israel) and one regional organization, ESA) independently launched satellites on launch vehicles developed in their own country is
 main aati hai
 ) dakshin korea, iran, brazil, pakistan, romania, kazakstan, australia, malaysia or turki sahit kai anya desh, apane chote paimaane par lanchar kshamtaaon ke vikaas ke vibhinn charnon main hai or antariksh shaktiyon ke club main sadsyta chaahate hai
 It is determined that South Korea will launch a KSLV rocket in early 2008 and become the next space power
 Iran has already successfully tested its own space launch vehicle) and is scheduled to send its first domestic satellite ) In the classroom within a year from 4 February 2008
 It is expected that Brazil and Pakistan will do so in the near future jabaki canada teesraa desh he jisane antariksh main stapit upgrah banaaya tha, yah videsh main ek america antarikshatat se ek america rocket shuru kii gai thi
 The same goes for Australia, who launched a Donated Redstone rocket on-board
 pehla italian-prakshepan san marco 1 tha, jo 15 disambar, 1964 ko vallops dweep main se ek america scout rocket par nasa dwaara prashikshit ek italvi prakshepan team ke saath shuru kiya gaya tha
 In November 1967, Australia's launch project also included a donated US missile and support from US staff and the United Kingdom facility
 kazakstan ne daawa kiya ki usne apane upgrah swatantra rup se banaaye he, lekin pehle jaise polish or balgerian kii tarah upgrah roosi madad ke saath banaaya gaya tha
 Recently, satellites have been scrapped by terrorist organizations to broadcast propaganda and steal classified information from military communications networks
 prithvi kii nichali kaksha main maujuud upgrahon ko belistic prakshepastra se prithvi par se nasht kar diya gaya he
 Both Russia and the United States have demonstrated the capability to eliminate satellites
 2007 main chini sena ne ek mausam upgrah daaga, is ke baad america nausena ne mrit jasusi upgrah farvari 2008 main daaga
sheet yuddh ke dauraan rus or sanyukt rajya america ne bhi upgrahon ko daaga he
 Due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions, ground-based transmitters have radio jamming
 is tarah kii jamming transmeter kii seemaa ke bheetar bhugolic kshetra ke liye simit he
 GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming, but satellite phone and television signals have also been employed for jamming
 benin main atakora pahadiyaan The Togo hills are a range in the Togo country in the western part of Africa that passes through the middle of that country and also to the country of Benin in the east and Ghana in the west
 ghana main yah pahadiyaan akvapim pahaad or benin main atakora pahaad ke naam se jaani jaati hai
 In the past, the African wild dog lived in this range, but now it has been chased from this terrain

 The peace text of this Upanishad is as follows: is upanishad kaa prasiddh shloke nimnlikhit he - The following verses come at the beginning and end of the Vrihadaranyaka Upanishad- vrikk yaa gurde kaa joda ek maanav ang hai, jinka pradhan kaary mutr utpaadan karnaa he
 The kidneys are found in many vertebrate animals
 ye mutr-pranali ke ang hai
 They regulate the electrolyte, alkali-acid balance and blood pressure
 inkaa mel swarup mutr kehalaata he
 It mainly consists of urea and ammonia
 gurde yugmit ang hote hai, jo kai kaary karte hai
 They are found in many types of animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates
 ye hamaari mutr-pranali kaa ek aavashyak bhaag hai or ye electrolite niyantran, amla-kshar santulan, va raktchaap niyantran aadi jaise samasthiti kaary bhi karte he
 These act as natural purifiers of blood in the body and remove waste, which is then sent to the bladder
 mutr kaa utpaadan karte samay, gurde uria or ammonium jaise apshisht padaarth utsarjit karte hai; gurde jal, glucose or amino amlon ke punarvasoshana ke liye bhi zimmedaar hote hai
 The kidneys also produce hormones, including calcitriol, renin, and erythropoietin
 audrik guha ke pichley bhaag main retroperitonium The kidneys located in the vesicles receive blood from a pair of renal arteries and flow it into a pair of renal veins
 prayek gurda mutr ko ek mutrvahini main utsarjit karata he, jo ki swayan bhi mutrashay main rikt hone vaali ek yugmit sanrachana hoti he
 The study of kidney function is called renal physiology, while the medical method related to kidney diseases is called Meghalogy
 gurde kii bimaariyaan vividh prakaar kii hai, lekin gurde se judi bimariyon ke rogiyon main aksar vishisht chikitsiya lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Common medical conditions associated with the kidney include nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute renal lesions, chronic kidney diseases, urethral infections, renal calculi and ureteric obstruction
 gurde ke cancer ke anek prakaar bhi maujuud hai; sabase aam vayask vrikk cancer vrikk koshika karkat he
 Cancer, cyst and some other kidney conditions can be managed by removal of the kidney, or by renal dissection
 jab gurde kaa kaary, jise kechikagucchheey shuddhikaran dar ke dwaara napa jaataa he, lagaataar buree ho, to dyalisis or gurde kaa pratyaropan iske upachaar ke vikalp ho sakate hai
 Although stones are not very harmful, they can also cause pain and problems
 pathari ko hataane kii prakriya main dhwani tarangon dwaara upachaar shaamil he, jisase pathar ko chote tukdon main todakar mutrashay ke raste baahar nikaal diya jaataa he
 Intense pain in the medial / lateral segments of the back of the back is a common symptom of appendicitis
 manushyon main, gurde udar guha main retroperitonium naamak rikt sthaan main sthit hote hai
 Their number is two and one of these kidneys is located one on either side of the spinal cord; They are approximately at the vertebral level from T12 to L3
 daayan gurda madhyapat ke thik neeche or yakrut ke peeche sthit hota he, tathaa baayan madhyapat ke neeche or pleeha ke peeche hota he
 There is an adrenal gland at the top of each kidney
 yakrut ke kaaran udar guha main pai jane vaali vishmata ke kaaran daayan gurda baayen kii tulana main thodaa neeche hota he or baayan gurda daaen kii tulana main thodaa adhik madhyam main sthit hota he
 The upper part of the kidney is partially protected by the eleventh and twelfth ribs and the entire kidney and adrenal glands are covered by fat and renal bandage
 prayek vayask gurde kaa bhaar purushon main 125 se 170 gram ke bich or mahilaon main 115 se 155 gram ke bich hota he
 Typically, the left kidney is slightly larger than the right
 gurde kii sanrachana saim ke aakaar kii hoti he, prayek gurde main avatal or uttal satahen pai jaati hai
 The concave surface, called the renal nucleus, is the point from which the renal artery enters this organ and the renal vein and ureter exit
 gurda sakht reshedaar utakon, vrikkeey capsule se ghira hota he, jo swayan perinephric vasa, vrikk pattee tathaa paranefric vasa se ghiri hoti he
 The anterior border of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior border is the transversalis bandage
 daaen gurde kii upree seemaa yakruy se satee hui hoti he; or baayin seemaa pleeha se judi hoti he
 Therefore, both of these go down when breathing
 gurda lagbhag 11-14 semi lanbaa, 6 semi chaudaa or 3 semi motaa hota he
 The substance of the kidney, or organism, is divided into two main structures: the renal bark in the upper part and the renal medulla within it
 kul milakar ye sanrachanaayen shanku ke aakaar ke aath se atharah vrikkeey khandon kii ek akruti banaati hai, jinamein se prayek main majja ke ek bhaag ko dhankane vaali vrikk chaal hoti he, jise vrikkeey pyramid kaha jaataa he
 Between the renal pyramids are bark ridges, called renal columns
 nefron, gurde kii mutr utpann karne vaali kaaryaatmak sanrachanaayen, chaal se lekar majja tak faili hoti hai
 The initial purification part of a nephron is the renal corpuscle located in the bark, followed by a renal tubule known deep into the medullary pyramids through the bark
 ek majjatmak kiran, vrikkeey chaal kaa ek bhaag, vrikkeey nalikaaon kaa ek samooh hota he, jo ek ekal sangrahan nalika main jaakar rikt hoti hai
 The end of each pyramid, or sprout, carries urine into the miniature follicle, the miniature follicle empties into the main follicles, and the main follicle empties into the renal pelvis, which becomes the urinaloid
 gurde baayin tathaa dahini vrikk dhamniyon se rakt praapt karte hai, jo sidhe audrik mahadhamani se nikalati hai
 Despite their relatively small size the kidneys receive about 20% of the blood released from the heart
 prayek vrikkeey dhamni anek khandaatmak dhamniyon main vibhajit ho jaati he, jo aage antarkhandtmak dhamniyon main bant jaati hai, jo vrikkeey capsule kaa chhedan karti hai or vrikkeey pyramidon ke bich sthit vrikkeey stambhon se hokar guzarati hai
 Subcutaneous arteries then supply blood to the arterial arteries, which are at the border of the bark and medulla
 prayek chapakar dhamni vibhinn antarkhandtmak dhamniyaan pradaan karti he, jo abhivahi dhamniyon ko bharti hai, jo glomeruli ko rakt kii aapurti karti hai
 Interstitum) is the functional space in the kidney, which is located under single fibers, which are filled with blood vessels
 interstitom mutr se punarprapt hue drav ko avashoshit kar letaa he
 Many conditions can cause scarring or blood clotting in this area, which can result in obstruction of kidney function and may even stop functioning
 shodhan kii prakriya purna ho jane par rakt shirikaon ke ek chote network se hokar guzarataa he, jo antarkhandtmak shiraaon kii ore abhisaran karti hai
 The veins also follow the same arterial distribution pattern, the afferent veins deliver blood to the umbilical veins, and from there it leads to the interdigital veins, which form the renal veins that exit the kidney for blood transfusions
 vrikkeey utak-vigyaan main gurde kii ek sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dikhaai dene vaali sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Several distinct cell-types are found in the kidney, including the following: gurda or snaayu tantra vrikkeey jaal ke madhyam se aapas main samvaad karte hai, jiske reshe gurde tak pahunchane ke liye vrikkeey dhamniyon ke saath jude hote hai
 Input from the sympathetic nervous system induces vasoconstrictors in the kidney, causing renal blood flow to decrease
 aisa mana jaataa he ki gurde sahanukampi snaayu tantra se input praapt nahin karte
 gurde se nikalne vaale samvedak input merudand ke T10-11 staron kii ore badhata he or sambandhit antartvacha dwaara mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the pain felt in the armpits may be related to the kidneys
 amla-kshar santulan, electrolite sandrata, koshiketar drav maatra ko niyantrit karke or raktchaap par niyantran rakhte hue gurde puure sharir ke homeostasis main bhaag lete hai
 The kidneys perform these homeostatic functions both independently and in association with other organs, particularly the organs of the endocrine system
 in antahsravi kaaryon kii purti ke liye vibhinn antahsravi hormone ke bich talmail kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jinamein renin, angiotensis II, eldosterone, antidiauratic hormone or artial natriuratic peptid aadi shaamil hai
 Many of the functions of the kidney are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of refining, reabsorption and secretion that occur in the nephron
 parishodhan, jo ki vrikkeey kanika main hota he, ek prakriya he jiske dwaara koshikaayen tathaa bade protein rakt se chaane jate hai or ek ultraphiltret kaa nirmaan hota he, jo antat mutr banegaa
 gurde ek din main 180 litre ultraphiltret utpann karte hai, jiskaa ek bahut bada pratishat punarvashoshit kar liya jaataa he or mutr kii lagbhag 2 litre maatra kii utpann hoti he
 The transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate into the blood is called reabsorption
 srav isaki vipareet prakriya he, jisamen anu vipareet disha main, rakt se mutr kii ore bheje jate hai
 Car waste materials emit
 inamen protein apachay se utpann nitrogen-yukt apshisht uria or neucleic amla ke chayapachay se utpann urik amla shaamil hai
 Any significant increase or fall in plasma osmolarity is identified by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior mucous gland
 parasaraniyata main vruddhi hone par yah granthi antidiauratic hormone adiech kaa srav karti he, jiske parinamswaroop gurde dwaara jal kaa punarvasoshana kiya jaataa he or mutr kii sandrata bad jaati he
 These two factors work together to bring plasma osmolality back to normal levels
 adiech sangrahan nalika main sthit mukhya koshikaon se judaa hota he, jo equaporin ko majja main sthanantarit karata he, taaki jal saamanytah abhedya majja ko chhod sake or vaasa riekta dwaara sharir main iskaa punarvasoshana kiya ja sake, jisase sharir main plasma kii maatra main vruddhi hoti he
 There are two systems that create hyperpolar marrow and thus increase the amount of plasma in the body: urea recycling and 'single effect'
 uria saamanytah gurdon se ek apshisht padaarth ke rup main utsarjit kiya jaataa he
 However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released, exposed aquaporins are also susceptible to urea
 isse uria ko ek hyper sangrahan nalika ko chhodkar majja main pravesh karke jal ko ‘aakarshith’ karne vaale ek hyperosmctic vilyan kaa nirmaan karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be re-excreted or recycled depending on whether ADH is still present
 ‘ekal prabhaav’ is tathy kaa varnan karata he ki lups of henley kaa motaa arohi ang jal ke dwaara bhedya nahin he, lekin bhu
ni ke dwaara bhedya he
 This means that a counter-flow system is created, through which the medulla becomes more concentrated and if the collecting duct is opened by the ADH, it must be followed by a osmolarity ratio of water
 lambii-avadhi main raktchaap kaa niyantran mukhyatah gurde par nirbhar hota he
 This is mainly through the maintenance of extracellular fluid subdivision, whose size depends on the plasma sodium concentration
 haalanki, gurde sidhe hi raktchaap kaa anumaan nahin laga sakate, lekin nefron ke duurastha bhaagon main sodium or chloride kii supurdagee main parivartan gurde dwaara kiye jane vaale kinvak renin ke srav ko parivartit kar detaa he
 When the extracellular fluid subdivision is expanded and blood pressure is high, the delivery of these ions increases and the secretion of renin decreases
 isi prakaar, jab koshiketar drav upkhand sankuchit ho or raktchaap nimna ho, to sodium or chloride kii supurdagee kam ho jaati he or pratikriyaswaroop renin srav bad jaataa he
 Renin is the first member of a series of chemical messengers that together form the renin – angiotensin mechanism
 renin main hone vaale parivartan antat is tantra ke output, mukhya rup se angiotencin II or eldosteron, ko parivartit karte hai
 Each hormone acts through multiple mechanisms, but both increase the absorption of sodium chloride by the kidneys, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid subdivision and raising blood pressure
 jab renin ke str bade hue hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron kii sandrata bad jaati he, jiske parinamswaroop sodium chloride ke punarvasoshana main vruddhi hoti he, koshiketar drav upkhand kaa vistaar hota he or raktchaap bad jaataa he
 Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, causing contraction of the extracellular fluid subdivision and decreasing blood pressure
 gurde anek prakaar ke hormone kaa srav karte hai, jinamein arethropitin, calcetriol or renin shaamil hai
 Erythropoietin is released as a response to hypoxia in the renal flow
 yah asthi-majja main arethropoasis ko utprerit karata he
 Calcitriol, the catalytic form of vitamin D, encourages intestinal absorption of calcium and renal reabsorption of phosphate
 renin, jo ki renin-angiotencin-eldosteron tantra kaa ek bhaag he, eldosteron staron ke niyantran main shaamil ek enzim hota he

 The kidneys of reptiles are made up of several segments, which are roughly arranged in a linear pattern
 prayek khand ke centre main mutrvahini kii ek ekal shakha hoti he, jisamen sangrahan vahini aakar rikt hoti he

 The latter symptom is due to the presence of a large size of the loops of Henle; They are much smaller in birds and are not found in other vertebrates
 Only in mammal organisms, the kidney is in its traditional "kidney" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multi-tubular reniculate kidneys of members of the Timberg
