 basti ke nikat maanav aabaadi main, ve kapade, kambal or takie churaane or lakdi ke bhawanon main maand main istemaal ke liye le jane ke liye jane jate hai
 While the diet and anatomy of dasyurids are similar, different body sizes affect temperature control and thus behavior
 In ambient temperatures between 5 and 30 degrees, the devil was able to maintain body temperature between 37
4 and 38 degrees
 jab taapmaana 40 se badhaya gaya tha or ardrata 50% rakhi gai to 60 minute ke bheetar divil ke sharir kaa taapmaana do degree upar ho gaya, lekin iske baad dhire-dhire kam hota hua do ghante baad praarambhik str par pahunch gaya or do ghante tak ise banaae rakhaa
 is dauraan is divil ne pani piya or kisi prakaar kii takalif kaa koi lakshan dikhaai nahin diya, isse vaigyanikon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki pasinaa or vashpikarniya shithan ooshmaa apvyay kaa praathmik madhyam he
 a later study found that devils gasp, but do not sweat to remove heat
 In contrast, many other marsupials were unable to lower their body temperature
 chunki chote jaanwaron ko adhik garm or adhik shushk paristhitiyon main rahanaa padataa tha, jiske liye ve achachhi tarah se anukulit nahin the, isliye ve nishachar kii jivan style apanaate hai or din main apane sharir kaa taapmaana giraate hai, din main divil sakriy rahata he or uske sharir kaa taapmaana 1

 The standard metabolic rate of a Tasmanian devil is 141 kj / kg per day, which is several times lower than smaller marsupials
 ek 5 kilogram divil prati din 712 kilogul upyog karata he
 The field metabolic rate is 407 kg / kg

 The devil is the predominant species in Tasmania's ecosystem
 tasmanian divil ek chote kangaroo ke aakaar tak ke shikaar kar saktaa he, kintu vyavhaar main ve avasarwaadi hote hai or jitani baar ve shikaar karte hai usase adhik baar sada hua maance khate hai
 Although the ease of devil predation favors the vombat, due to its high fat content, it can eat all native mammals such as betongs and potoruses, domestic mammals, birds, fish, fruits, plant material, insects, tadpoles, frogs and reptiles
 inkaa aahaar bade paimaane par bhinn hota he or ye aahaar kii uplabdhta par nirbhar karte hai
 Before the extinction of the thylacine, the Tasmanian devils ate the thylacine's children left alone in the den when their parents were out
 isse thailacin ke viluptikaran kii prakriya tej karne main sahaayta mili hogi, jo swayan bhi divil ko khate the
 They are known to hunt mice in prey sea waters and find dead fish thrown ashore
 maanav basti ke nikat, ve juute chori kar sakate hai or un ko chaba sakate hai, or lakdi ke kaarkaane main aakar funs gai, anyathaa majboot bhed kii jhulati taangon ko kha sakate hai
 Other unusual materials seen in the devil's feces include the animal's leash and tags, the echidna's secure spine, pencils, plastic, and jeans
 Although devils can cut metal nets, they protect their strong jaws to escape from bondage instead of encroaching into the food store
 apni apekshaakrit gati kii kami ke kaaran ve, ve wolebi yaa khargosh kaa peechha nahin kar sakate, lekin beemaari ke kaaran dhimen pad gaye jaanwaron par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 They sniff a flock of sheep from 10-15 meters away and attack a sheep if they become ill

 There are reports that despite the lack of extreme speed, they can run from 25 km / h to 1
5 km and it is estimated that before the introduction of European immigration and animals, vehicles and death on the road, they have to find food
 Other native animals had to be chased at the proper speed
 pemberton ne bataaya he ki ve prati saptaah kai raaton ko "vistaarit avadhi" main 10 kimi prati ghanta kii gati se daud sakate hai, ve sthir hokar baithne se pehle lambii duriyon tak daud sakate hai, aisa kuch jise ghaat laga kar hamalaa karne kaa pramaan mana gaya he
 They can also dig to find the corpse, in one case digging to eat the corpse of a horse that died of disease
 divil, jaanwaron ke shavon ko khate samay pehle, sharir rachana ke sabase narm bhaag, unke pachan tantra ko khaane ke liye jane jate hai or khate samay ve praayah banaai gai guha main rahete hai
 They consume an average of about 15% of their body weight per day; However, if given the opportunity, they can eat up to 40% of their weight in 30 minutes
 iskaa matlab yah ki ek bade bhojan ke baad yah bahut baari or sust ho saktaa he, is sthiti main yah dagamagaate hue dhire dhire jaataa he or let jaataa he or us tak pahunchnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 This has led to the belief that such eating habits have become possible due to the lack of predatory predator attacks on such bloated animals
 tasmanian divil ek chote jaanavar ke shav ke sabhi avshesh saaf kar saktaa he, jarurat padane par fer or haddiyaan tak nigal jaataa he
 In this regard, the devil has earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, the speed with which it cleans the carcass, helping to prevent the spread of insects that may harm livestock
 inamen se kuch mrit jaanwaron kaa nipataara tab hota he, jab divil atirikt bhojan ko baad main khaanaa shuru karne ke liye ghaseet kar apane nivas par le jate hai
 According to a study in Cradle Mountain, the devil's dose may vary by male, female and season, in winter, males prefer smaller mammals in the ratio of 4: 5 than in adults, but in summer they prefer 7: 2
 Prefer larger prey in proportion to

 Females are less inclined to target less large prey, but seasonal bias also occurs in them
 sardiyon main bade or madhyam standhari 25 or 58% prayek tathaa 7% chote stanpayi or 10% pakshi khaae jate hai
 In summer, 61 and 37% are consumed respectively for the first two categories

 Teens have also been seen climbing trees and catching birds from nests
 puure varsh ke dauraan, vayask divil aple jaiwabhaar seven kaa 16
2% vrikshavasi prajatiyon se, joki lagbhag sara posam maance hota he, tathaa 1% bade pakshiyon se praapt karte hai
 From February to July, juvenile devils derive 35
8% of their biomass intake from arboreal life, 12
2% from small birds, and 23
2% from possum meat

0% vrikshavasi prajatiyon se praapt karti hai jisamen 26
7% posam or 8
9% vibhinn pakshi hote hai
 Not all of these animals were caught in the trees, but this elevated figure of females, which is higher than the spotted-tailed male quoll in the same season, is unusual, because the devil's skill at climbing trees is weak
 haalanki ve akele shikaar karte hai, samuhik shikaar ke apusht daawey kiye gaye hai jahaan ek shikaar ko uske awaas se baahar nikaalata he or uske saathi hamalaa karte hai, khaanaa tasmanian divil ke liye ek saamaajik ghatana he
 a solitary animal that collectively eats, this combination makes it unique among carnivores
 is jaanavar ke saath judaa hua adhikansh shor iske karkash samuhik khaane kaa parinaam he, jahaan 12 tak divil ikatthe hote hai, or aksar kai kilometak dur se suna ja saktaa he
 This is due to informing associates of their involvement in food so that food is not wasted by rot and energy is also saved
 shor kii maatra shav ke aakaar se sahasambaddha he
 Devils eat according to a system
 kishor godhuli bela main sakriy hote hai, isliye ve vayaskon se pehle strot tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 Usually, the powerful animal eats until it is satisfied and leaves, fighting off any challenges in the meantime
 haare hue jaanavar khadey bal or poonch ke saath jhaadi main daud jate hai, unka vijeta peeche se kaat kar unhen khadedta he
 Fights are less common as the source of food increases, as they are aimed at getting enough food and not suppressing other devils
 When the quolls are eating a corpse, the devils try to chase them away
 chiththidaar poonch vaale quol ke liye yah ek mahatvapurn samasya he, kyonki ve apekshaakrit bade posam ko maarthe hai or dawilon ke aagaman se pehle khaanaa khatm nahin kar pate
 iske vipareet, chote purvi quol bahut chote shikaron kaa shikaar karte hai or dawilon ke aane se pehle khaanaa puraa kar sakate hai
 This is seen as a possible cause of the relatively small population of spotted-tailed quolls

 They usually establish dominance with voice and physical tone, although fighting also ensues
 divil ke safed dhabbe sahyogiyon ko raat main dikhaai de jate hai
 Chemical signals are also used
 vayask purush sarvaadhik aakraamak hote hai, or kshatigrast karnaa aam he
 They can stand on their hind legs and push each other's shoulders with their front legs and head, like sumo wrestling
 Occasionally torn flesh near the mouth and teeth, as well as holes on the tendon, can be seen, although these injuries may have occurred during reproduction

 Devils are known to return to the same place for defecation, due to doing so at a community location, the place is called Devil Toilet
 yah mana jaataa he ki saamudayik shouch, sanchaar kaa ek saadhan ho saktaa he jise thik se samajha nahin gaya
 The size of the devil's wings is much larger than that of the body; It has an average length of 15 cm, but also a sample of 25 cm in length
 ve haddiyon ko pachaa vajah se rang main bhure rang ke visheshta he, yaa haddi ke tukade bhi shaamil hai
 Owen and Pemberton believe that the relationship between the Tasmanian devil and the thylacine is "close and complex", as they competed directly for hunting and perhaps also shelter, the thylacine hunted the devils and the devils ate the dead thylacine, and Devils ate the thylacine's baby
 Mena Jones hypothesizes that the two species share the role of Tasmania's top predator
 keel-poonch chil kaa laash aadhaarit aahaar dawilon ke samaan he isiilie inhen bhi ek pratiyogi ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Quoll and Devil are also seen in direct competition in Tasmania
 jones kaa maananaa tha ki quol ne apane ko 100-200 pidhiyon ke baad lagbhag do varsh main viksit kiya he, jaisaa ki dawilon, sabase badi prajati, chiththidaar-poonch vaale quol, sabase choti prajati purvi quol par baraabar rikti prabhaav dwaara nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 Females usually start breeding when they reach sexual maturity in their second year
 is bindu par, ve saal main ek baar upjau hoti hai or kamottejnaa main kai dimbon kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Since hunting is abundant in spring and early summer, the reintroduction cycle of devils begins in March or April so that weaning time coincides with the maximization of food supplies in the wild for newborn devils
 Occurring in March, mating occurs during both day and night in shelters
 prajnan ke mausam main nar maadaaon ke liye ladate hai or maadaa divil prabhutv paane vaale ke saath sahavaas karti he
 Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and intercourse can be five days; For example, a pair is recorded in a rati den for eight days
 dawills, ekapatnik nahin hote hai or maadaaen sambhog ke baad raksha nahin kii jaati he to kai naron ke saath sambhog karti hai; nar bhi mausam ke dauraan kai maadaaon ke saath punarutpaadan karte hai
 Females have been shown to be selective in an effort to ensure the best genetic progeny, for example by driving small males away

 nar, apane purna jivan main 16 bacchon kaa utpaadan kar saktaa he, jabaki maadaaon ke jivan main ausatan chaar sambhog mausam or 12 santaanen aati hai
 Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and overcome the species with high mortality

 Tasmanian devil children are called by various names, "paps", "joyce" or "imps"
 When young are born, competition fierce as they move from the vagina to the sac in a viscous flow of mucus
 ek baar thili ke andar aane par, unamem se prayek agle 100 dinon ke liye ek nipal se judaa rahata he
 The female Tasmanian devil's bag, such as the Wombat, opens backwards, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with the children inside the pouch
 ek saath janmen bacchon kii badi sankhya ke baavjood maadaa ke keval chaar nipal hai, to thili main chaar se adhik shishu kabhi nahin pal sakate; maadaa divil jitani badi hoti he, ek saath janmen bacchon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 Once the baby makes contact with the nipple, it expands, resulting in the enlarged nipple tightening tightly inside the newborn, ensuring that the newborn does not fall out of the pouch
 On average, females live longer than males, and up to 60% of puppies do not live to mature
 thili ke andar, poshit navjaat jaldi se viksit hote hai
 In the second week, the nasalia becomes specialized and becomes heavily pigmented

2 and 1
6 cm

 After eight weeks the devils can start making creaking noises and after about 10–11 weeks the lips may open
 papoton ke gathan ke baavjood, ve teen maheene tak khulte nahin hai, haalanki palken 50 dinon ke aasapaas ban jaati hai
 Babies who were pink by this time start growing fur in 49 days and by 90 days the whole layer of fur is ready

 During the third week, the vertebral and endodermal axillary are formed first
 iske baad, avanetrakotor, antarshakhiya, adhyakshi or avchibukeey drudhrome banate hai
 The last four are usually between the 26th and the 39th day

 During this transitional phase outside the sac, young devils are relatively safe from predation because usually someone is with them

 jabaki sabhi pille doodh chhudaane tak jivit rahete hai, guiller ne bataaya ki teen bata paanch divil paripakvata tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 As juveniles are more dusky than adults, their presence in the open during summer creates a perception of a population boom in people

 Guiller has reported that hostile devils have had frequent hermaphroditism, while Pemberton and Mooney recorded in 2004 an animal with a scrotum and a non-functional sac

 The reason for their extinction is not clear, but their scarcity is the same time of indigenous Australians and wild dogs expanding across the mainland

 Brown also proposed that the El niño-southern Oscillation strengthened during the innovative era, and that the devil was highly sensitive to it, with a short life span as a scavenger

 It is difficult to estimate the size of the devil's population
 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main, anumaanit jansankhya 130,000-150,000 jaanavar thi, lekin yah ek adhik anumaan ke jaisaa prathit hota he
 The population of Tasmanian devils was calculated by Tasmania's Primary Industries and Water Department in 2008 in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 animals, with perhaps 20,000 to 50,000 mature animals
 visheshgyon kaa anumaan he ki divil ko 1990 ke madhya se apni jansankhya main 80% se adhik giravat kaa saamana karnaa padaa tathaa 2008 tak keval 10,000-15,000 jangalon main bache hai
 The species was listed unprotected in 2005 under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and in 2006 under the Australian Environment Protection and Conservation Act 1999, meaning it is at risk of extinction in the "medium term"

 However Guiller's research asserts that the real cause of cattle loss was poor land management policies and wild dogs

 In earlier times, Valleby's hunting for Possum and Fur was a big trade — more than 900,000 animals were hunted in 1923 — and resulted in constant hunting of devils as they were considered a major threat to the fur industry
 , Even quolls were more adept at hunting relevant animals

 This is not considered a sufficient problem for the devil to survive

 The decline in the number of devils is also seen as an ecological problem, with its presence in the Tasmanian forest ecosystem believed to be the reason for the establishment of red foxes, which were illegally introduced in Tasmania in the early 21st century Is, and because of the devils' eating of dead animals, it limited the number of foxes, wild cats and dogs, otherwise In den as killing adult foxes and young foxes that are their food
 In all other Australian states, foxes are a problematic invasive species, and in Tasmania, fox settling will disrupt the health of the Tasmanian devil and will be prey to many vertebrate species
 It is believed that young Tasmanian devils are insecure from eating red fox meat, and there will be direct competition for the den and habitat of those devils and foxes
 a common means of trying to prevent foxes is to use meat that is decorated with sodium fluoroacetate to trap
 As devils and other native animals can also be attracted to poisonous meat, which is placed inside the M-44 ejector device, adaptations have been made to the geometry of the device and the force and jaws required to open it
 Geometry, which fits the fox but does not fit the local species
 The foxes have not yet been fully established in Tasmania to intimidate Tasmanian devils
 Which fits the fox but does not sit on the local species

 According to the 1961 census Ealing, Enfield, Harrow, Hendon, Heston and Isleworth, Tottenham, Wimbley, Willesden and Twickenham, etc
 all have a population of over 100,000, which generally gives them the right to obtain county territory status

 Following the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, the Lok Sabha promulgated the London Government Act 1963, which became effective from 1 April 1963

 The remaining areas were the Potters Bar Urban District, which became a part of Hertfordshire while the sunbury-on-thames Urban District and Staines Urban District became part of Surrey
 in parivartanon ke baad, middlesex se sambandhit loksabhaa ke sthaneey adhinium ab sabhi nau "north west landan boro" par lagu hote the
 In 1974 the three urban districts which were transferred to Hertfordshire and Surrey were abolished and became the districts of Hartsmeyer and Spelthorne respectively
 In 1995 Poyle Village was moved from Spelthorne to the Berkshire area of slough

 The county falls under the London Basin and its main feature is the River Thames, which is its southern boundary
 purv or pashchim main nadi lee or nadi koln iskaa prakritik parisemen karti hai
 The Thames River winding to the southwest of the county is such that it forms the "middlesex Bank", which is descriptively more correct than the "north Bank"; This difference is also taken care of during the boat race

 One was named "middlesex" which included the areas of Barnett, Brent, Ealing, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Hillingdon and Hounslow

 Middlesex is also expressed as a former postal county; Which until 1996 was commonly used in postal addresses and is now optional
 1965 ke baad postal county ko punah manyata mil gayi kyonki royal mail sabhi parivartanon ko county kii seemaa ke andar paalan kar paane main asamarth thi or greater landan ko bhi postal county ke rup main sweekaar nahin kar sakati thi
 However, most parts of inner Middlesex were within the Postal District of London, under which the address already contained "london" and not the county
 hertfordshire main potters baar kaa sthanantaran royal mail dwaara angeekrut kiya gaya tha, lekin stance or sanabari kaa saare main sthaanantaran sweekaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 The remaining Postal County consisted of two unconnected areas, separated by 6 miles, and included the following post town: † = postal county kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi There were many inconsistencies in Postal County in places where its post town encroached on neighboring counties, such as the village of Denham, Buckinghamshire, which falls under Uxbridge Post Town and therefore considered postal county of Middlesex; Hampton Wick, by contrast, was tendered in Middlesex County because it was affiliated with Surrey's post office
 is vajah se hampton court pales ke pate se aisa lagata he ki jaise yah purv molse, saare main sthit ho
 Stensbury, Berkshire and Ingham Hythe, Surrey, etc
 are in Stance Post Town and are therefore included in Middlesex County

 Drumayuka, mahu or aphid are small-sized insects that suck the sap of plants

 Mahu are the most destructive enemies of the crops grown in agriculture in temperate regions

 Drumyuca, or plant lice, is altruistic on all types of greens, vegetables, fruits, crops and orchards
 ye mandgatisheel hoti hai
 These arise in thousands and cause great damage to the plants by piercing them and sucking their juices

 So these are economically harmful pests

 Its males and females mate together, after which the female lays eggs
 ye andey jaade ko vyateetkar vasantaritu main maadaa drumayuka kii utpatti karte hai, jo adhiktar pankharahit hoti hai
 But sometimes, due to lack of food, feathery females also arise, which fly from one place to another to feed and keep their offspring
 nar saadhaaran: pankhayukt hote hai
 Breeding in Drumyuca occurs very quickly when sufficient quantities of food are available and thus they conquer life struggle by their abundant fertility and protect their offspring from sparrows and other insect enemies
 yadi chidiyaan, makadiyaan, paropjivi or birbahootiyaan na hotin, to drumayuka kaa utpaat itnaa bad jaataa ki sambhavat: sampoornan vanaspati hi nasht ho jaati

 Therefore, Drumayukas are also called ants cows

 The food-root-destructive Drumayuka has become completely dependent on ants

 According to some, it is the descendants of the Kyrgyz people who once lived in the region of the Yenisei River and whose other descendants live in modern Kyrgyzstan

 isane agle varsh lokapriy puraskaar samarohon main kai puraskaar jite, jisamen paanch filmafere puraskaar bhi shaamil the
 Yashvardhan "yash" Raichand is a prosperous business tycoon who lives in Delhi with his wife Nandini and two sons Rahul and Rohan
 rahul bada putr hai or janm ke samay yash or nandini dwaara use apanaaya gaya tha
 It is known to everyone in Raichand's house except Rohan
 rychand kaa ghar paramparaon kaa paalan karata he
 Rahul grows up to meet Anjali Sharma when he grows up and eventually falls in love
 lekin unka pyaar ko manaa kar diya jaataa he, kyonki anjali kam aay vaali prishthbhumi se hoti he
 Yash and Nandini soon send Rohan to boarding school which is done by all the men in his family
 yash ne rahul se naina se shaadi karne kii apni ichha kii ghoshnaa kii
 But Naina learns that Rahul loves Anjali and encourages her to go to him
 jab yash ko iskaa pataa chal jaataa he to vah gusse main hota he
 Rahul promises not to marry Anjali
 apane vaade ko bataane ke liye wo ja rahaa hota he to pataa lagaataa he ki uske pita kii mrityu ho gai he or apane pita ke manaa karne ke baavjood usase shaadi karne kaa faisla karata he
 Yash is aware of the wedding and abandons Rahul
 nandini saidaa ko unke saath bhejti hai, taaki vah maa ke pyaar se alag na hon
 Rahul meets Rohan at boarding school and refuses to ask Rohan where or why he went and asks to take care of Nandini
 das saal baad rohan boarding skool se ghar lautataa he or rahul ke god lene ke sambandh main apni daadi or nani kii baatcheet sunata he
 Also he knows why Rahul left the house
 rohan parivaar ko dobaaraa jodne kaa vaada karata he
 He learns that Rahul, Anjali and his younger sister Pooja have gone to London
 vah apane mata-pita se kahata he ki vah landan main aage ke padhai jari rakhane kii ichha rakhata he
 In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their son, Krishna
 puja, jo ab ek lokapriy fishan-jununee yuvati he, kings college landan main ek chaatr he, jahaan rohan namakan karata he
 He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that he has come to London to take his brother and sister-in-law back home
 puja rahul ko bataati he ki rohan uske dost kaa bhai he, jiske paas vartmaan main rahane ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Just before Krishna attends the school ceremony, Saeeda and Anjali come to know his real identity, though they promise to remain silent
 krishna ke skool samaaroh main, krishna jan gana man gaate hue apni kaksha kaa netritv karata he or baad main rohan kii dwaara di hui salaah bolta he
 Rahul gave this advice to Rohan ten years ago
 ab vah mahasoos karata he ki rohan uskaa bhai he
 Also, Rohan and Pooja fall in love
 rohan ne rahul se ghar aane kaa aagrah kiya, lekin rahul ne manaa kar diya
 Pooja convinces Rohan to invite her parents to London
 ek duusare ko dekhakar rahul or nandini bahut khush hote hai, lekin rahul abhi bhi apane pita se baat karne se inkaar karata he

 It became the highest grossing film of 2001 after Ghadar: Ek Prem Katha
 maavafalang vidhansabha nirvachan kshetra bhartiya rajya meghalaya kaa ek vidhansabha kshetra he
 The current MLA from here is Sinter class numb
 is nirvachan kshetra se vidhayakon kii suchi nimnavat he – The exclusive right to complete control of power or dominance over a geographical area or group of people is called sovereignty
 saarvbhaum sarvocch vidhi nirmaataa evam niyantrak hota he yani samprabhutaa rajya kii sarvocch shakti he
 The rise of the modern state in Europe resulted in the concept of 'sovereignty' in the seventeenth century
 madhya europe main europee rajshahiyon or samrajyon main satta raja, pope or saamanton ke bich banti rahati thi
 The decline of the recognition of the Catholic Church in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries led to the disintegration of feudalism and the rise of Protestant faith gave sovereign states a chance to flourish
 samprabhutaa kaa matlab he - 'sampoorn or aseemit satta'
 But its implications are not so simple
 mahaz is arth se yah pataa nahin chalata ki akhir is sampoorn satta kii sanrachana main kya-kya shaamil he? kya iskaa matlab kisi sarvocch vaidhanik praadhikaar se hota he yaa phir iskaa sambandh ek aisi raajnneetik satta se he jise chunauti na di ja sake? Due to similar disputes over the meaning of sovereignty, it has been understood since the nineteenth century by dividing it into two parts: legal sovereignty and political sovereignty
 is avadharana ko vyaavhaarik rup se aantarik samprabhutaa or bahya samprabhutaa ke taur par bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The internal version of sovereignty means the division of power within the state, the supreme power within the political system
 bahya sanskaran kaa taatpary he antarrashtriya vyavastha ke tahat rajya dwaara ek swatantra or swytt vajood kii tarah sakriy rah paane kii kshamta kaa pradarshan
 The concept of sovereignty is also rooted in the basis of modern nation and nationalism
 rashtriya swatantraaa, swa-shashan or samprabhutaa ke vichaaron ke mili-jule prabhaav ke bina a-upniveshikaran ke us silsile kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati jiske tahat dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke baad asia, africa or laathini america main bade paimaane par naye rashtron kii rachana hui
 There is an intellectual history of the difference between legal and political sovereignty which has to be looked at to understand the differences between Jean Boaden and Thomas Hobbes
 bodaan ne apni rachana da sicks books of kaamanvil main ek aise samprabhu ke paksh main tark diya he jo khud kanoon banaata he, par swayan ko un kanoonon ke upar rakhata he
 According to this view, law means to run people on the orders of the sovereign
 iskaa matlab yah nahin bodaan yahan kisi nirankush shaasha kii vakaalat karnaa chaahate the
 He believed that the sovereign ruler who made and complied with the law would be subject to a higher law
 yani loukik shaasha ke praadhikaar par daivi kanoon kii muhar zaruri hogi
 Contrary to Bodan's view, Hobbes in his composition Leviathan describes the idea of sovereignty not in terms of authority, but in terms of power
 hobbs se pehle saint augusteen ne ek aise samprabhu kii zarurat par bal diya tha jo maanavtaa main antarnihit naitik buraaiyon ko kaabo main rakhega
 Further developing this logic, Hobbes, while defining sovereignty as a monopoly on the oppressive power, recommended that this power should be in the hands of the ruler alone
 haalaanki hobbs nirbaadh rajshahi ko praathamikta dete the, par ve yah maanane ke liye bhi taiyaar the yah satta shaskaon ke ek chote se gut yaa kisi loktantric sabha ke haath main bhi ho sakati he
 This debate between Bodas and Hobbes suggests that legal sovereignty rests on state law as paramount
 iske vipareet raajnneetik samprabhutaa satta ke vaastavik vitaran se judi hui he
 Despite this difference, one also has to believe that the practical notion of sovereignty has legal aspects as well as political aspects
 aadhunik rajyon kii samprabhutaa kanoon kii sarvoparita par bhi nirbhar he or us kanoon kaa anupaalan karwaane vaale sattamulak tantra par bhi jiske paas damankaaree mashinari hoti he
 No law applies merely on the basis of moral obligations
 dand dene vaali vyavastha, police, jail or adaalaton ke bina use kaayam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This equation of legal and political sovereignty seems to be effective on both sides
 kanoon ko apane anupaalan ke liye agar satta ke tantra kii zarurat he, to satta ko apni vaidhata ke liye kanoon kii sanstuti kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Governance has to be lawful and constitutional, only then its legitimacy is maintained
 keval raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke dam par taanashaah sarkarein hi kaam karti hai
 If the government is democratic then its oppressive machinery has to remain accountable before the courts by staying within the boundaries of law
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik swaroop ke prashn par raajnneetik siddhant ke daayaron main kaafii bahes hui he
 After all, what should be the place of supreme and unlimited power? Would it be better to place it in the hands of one ruler or would it be better to have its center vested in a representative institution? In the seventeenth century, Emperor Louis Fourteenth of France told Darp that i am the kingdom
 ek vyakti ke haath main samprabhutaa dene ke peeche tark yah he ki us surat main samprabhutaa ke avibhajya hone kaa guarantee rahegi
 His expression will be in one voice and no other authority will interfere in it
 samprabhutaa kii is sarvasattavadi dharna main prabhaavshaalee hastkshep attharahavin sadi main kiya gaya jab jyaan-zaak ruso ne lokapriy samprabhutaa kii avadharana pesh kii
 Russo, rejecting the rule of the monarchy, wrote in his composition Social Contract: 'man is born free, but everywhere he is held in chains
 ’ darasal, soshal kantrect aadhunik raajnneetik darshan ko ekadam nayaa rup de detii he
 Their social agreement is different from Hobbes and Locke's social settlement
 ruso se pehle ke darshanikon kaa yakeen tha ki manushya apni buddhigat kshamtaaon ke kaaran duusare praaniyon se bhinn he, jabaki ruso maanate hai ki insaan naitik chunaav kii kshamta ke kaaran alag he
 If he is not given the freedom to make this election, he will be nothing more than a slave
 chunki samaaj tarah-tarah kii a-swatantraaaon se bharaa hua he or manushya apni prakritik swatantraaa ke shuruaati sansar main nahin laut saktaa, isliye ruso tajaviz karte hai ki use apni us azaadi kaa vinimay naagarik swatantraaa se karnaa chahie
 For this, human beings will have to form associations with each other, social existence will be created under which all people will relinquish their rights and in turn get rights as citizens, will remain as members of one sovereign
 arthath ek samvidhan bananaa padegaa jiske tahat har vyakti adheen bhi hoga or sahabhaagi naagarik bhi
 Only this way freedom can be guaranteed
 yah loktantr kii avadharana thi, par ruso janata ke pratinidhiyon dwaara chalaaye jane vaale loktantr yaa vidhi-nirmaan se sahamat nahin the
 Like the direct democracy of ancient Greece, Rousseau wanted all citizens to congregate in a public place and formulate a law
 alpamat ko bahumat dwaara liye gayi nirnay ke adheen hone se bachaane ke liye ruso ne sarvasammati kaa paksh liya jise kargar banane ke liye unhone apane sabase vikhyath siddhant ‘jan-ichha’ kaa sutrikaran kiya
 Following the law created on the basis of 'public will' meant to follow one's own will
 ruso dwaara pravartit ‘jan-ichha’ kaa siddhant aage chal kar aadhunik loktantric siddhant kaa aadhaar bana
 Rousseau envisioned a comfortable community of citizens who would be the bearers of equality and unity beyond high-altitude relations, so he believed that it would be easy to provide 'public will' among them
 lekin ruso kabhi is prashn kaa uttar nahin de paye ki nagarikon kii aam sabha main vyakt kii jane vaali ichchhaaon main se ‘jarnal-vil’ kaise niklegi
 Therefore, in the end, they were seen saying that if 'people's will' is not available, then the will of the majority should be considered synonymous
 samprabhutaa ke siddhant ko udaarataavaadi-loktantric vichaar ke pairokaron ne aade haathon bhi liya he
 He says that the notion of sovereignty is unnecessary in the context of pluralistic and democratic governance
 ye log samprabhutaa ke vichaar ko uske sarvasattavadi ateet se peedit or isliye avaanchhneeya maanate hai
 He says that democratic governments are not run by the allegedly lawful regime imposed by the oppressive machinery
 ve to niyantran or santulan ke sameekaran or uske aadhaar par bane network ke zariye shashan karti hai
 Indeed, in modern states with a federal character, it is very difficult to determine the center of internal sovereignty
 sanyukt rajya america, canada, osterelia or bharat jaise sanghatmak rajyon main sarkaar do staron main vibhajit he or prayek str ke paas apane swytt adhikaar hai
 Sovereignty in such states emerges as a partnership between the center and the periphery
 aisi paristhiti main agar koi avibhajit samprabhu he to vah he samvidhan jo centre ko bhi samprabhutaa sampann banaata he or rajyon ko bhi
 External sovereignty signifies the status of a state in the international system
 is tarah kii paristhitiyaan bhi hoti hai ki kisi rajya main aantarik samprabhutaa par vivaad chalata rahata he, par antarrashtriya kshetra main uski bahya samprabhutaa kaa aadar kiya jaataa he
 Anyway, in the era of democracies, issues of internal sovereignty are no longer considered so important, but the question of external sovereignty has become more important than ever
 aise kai antarrashtriya vivaad hai jinamein ek desh kii samprabhutaa kaa daawa duusare desh kii taraf se apni samprabhutaa ke liye chunauti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The movement by the Palestinians for their sovereign nation is considered by Israel to be the cause of the decline of its sovereignty

 When an individual or institution is addressed as an Ambedkarite, it means that Bhimrao is adhering to the human values and ideals established by Ambedkar
 ambedkarwaad bhimrao ambedkar kaa darshan he
 In short, Ambedkarism is the name of the efforts made for the establishment of an egalitarian society
 Today, Ambedkarism's numbers are increasing very fast
 This masala is mainly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and is quite enthusiastic

 Lightning or "celestial lightning" is the discharge of electric charge into the atmosphere and the loudness produced by it is called lightning
 sansar main prativarsh lagbhag 1 karod 60 lakh tadit paidaa hote hai
 Probably, no other natural event would have generated so much fear, thrill and surprise, nor would it have done even today, as much as the lightning and thunder of the clouds
 anadi kaal se sansar ke praaia: sabhi deshon main yah vishwaas prachlit tha ki tadit ishwar kaa dand he, jiskaa prahaar vah us praani athwa vastu par karata he jiske upar vah kupit ho jaataa he
 The Greeks and Romans considered it to be the execution of the god Jupiter
 aaj bhi bahut se log aisa hi samajhate hai or tadit ke vaigyanik kaaran ko samajhane kii cheshtaa karne ke badale chirposhit andhvishwaas par hi adhik bharosa karte hai
 Many stories told in ancient scriptures emphasize his superstition
 vidyut sambandhi jaankariyon main kuch vruddhi hone par vaigyanikon kii yah dharna bani ki saadhaaran taur par tadit kii ghatana thik usee prakaar kii hoti he jaisaa sanghnitr ko anavisht karte samay uske platon ke bich vaayu main se hokar sphulingon kaa pravaah hota he
 No one had the courage to experiment to confirm this belief; But in the end, inspired by Benjamin Franklin, two French scientists, Dalibard and Delor, decided to carry out the experiment
 unhone dhaatu ke do chad liye
 Dalibard's rod was 40 feet and Delor's rod was 99 feet high
 donon hi chhadon se ve lagbhag dedh inch lambaai tak ke sphulingon kaa visarjan kara sakane main safal hue
 This experiment was very dangerous and later another scientist washed his life while repeating the same experiment
 phir bhi uparyukt prayog se yah nishchay na ho sakaa ki chado main utpann vidyut badalon se hi ai he, kyonki chhadon kii pahunch badalon tak nahin thi
 That's why Benjamin Franklin made his kiteboarding well-known experiment
 usne ek patang udayi or use badalon ke andar tak pahunchaaya
 As soon as the kite is drenched, both the kite and the door get tanned, which shows that both have become electrified
 us door main franklin ne ek chaabi band bhi di thi
 Taking the finger near the key led to the exhalation of the sphincters with the crackling sound of both
 itnaa hi nahin, us chaabi kaa sparsh leden jaar se karakar usne use aaweshit bhi kar liya
 This ensured that clouds also have electricity
 is vidyut ke sphuling rup main visarjan ko hi "tadit' kehete hai
 This immersion can occur between clouds and clouds, or between clouds and earth
 tadit praaia: kapasivarshi meghon main utpann hoti he
 These clouds have very strong upward wind currents, reaching a height of about 40,000 feet
 inamen kuch aisi kriyaayein hoti hai jinke kaaran inamen vidyut aaveshon kii utpatti tathaa viyojan hota rahata he
 For the explanation of these actions, Wilson, Simpson, Sucrez, etc
 have presented their theories, which seem to be conflicting, but all of them tell that the thirst of the thunder is in the clouds and for this, the watercourse existing in those clouds, or Precipitation particles, such as snowflakes, are responsible
 badalon main vidyudvitaran ke sambandh main bhi sabhi ekamat hai ki inke upree str dhanavisht tathaa madhya or nimnastar rinavishti hoten hai
 The division of these charges is also well above the zero degree c temperature levels inside the clouds
 isse yah nishkarsh sahaj hi praapt hota he ki aveshvibhaajan meghon main bananevaale himakanon tathaa urdhvagami pavandhaaraon se hi hota he, jal kii boondon se nahin
 Sometimes, even in low levels, there becomes a center of positive charges
 badalon ke nimna staron par rinvesh utpann ho jane ke kaaran neeche prithvi ke tal par preran dwaara dhanavesh utpann ho jate hai
 As the clouds move forward, these positive charges on the earth also move in the same way
 rinaveshon ke dwaara aakarshith hokar bhootal ke dhanavesh prithvi par khadi suchalak yaa ardhchaalak vastuon par upar tak chadh jate hai
 By this method, when the electrification of the clouds reaches the limit that the voltage gradient between the neighboring charges reaches the fractional value, then the dissolution of the electromagnet is in the form of long sphulings
 ise tadit kehete hai
 The lightning that comes towards the Earth reaches through several stages
 badalon se electranon kaa ek hillol 1 micro second main 50 meter neeche aata he or ruk jaataa he
 After about 50 Ma to 0, the second sequence starts, and in the same way, this wave reaches the earth at the end
 ise pramukh aghat kehete hai
 It takes a total time of 0
002 seconds to reach the Earth from its origin
 uparyukt tathy shonland tathaa unke sahyogiyon dwaara atyant sugrahi camere kii sahaayta se liye gaye photo chitra se prakat hue the
 On the same photo plaque, it was also shown that at the moment of reaching the earth, a very bright light went from the earth towards the clouds in the same order through which the main sequence came
 ise pratigaami apaat kehete hai
 While the average velocity of the principal sequence is 105 m per second, the velocity of the retrograde half is 107 m per second, because its path is already paved due to ionization
 uparyukt pramukh or pratigaami aghaton ke baad bhi kai aghat kramash:- neeche or upar kii ore aate-jate dikhalaai padate hai
 These are called secondary shock
 neeche aanevaale ye dwitiyak aghat pramukh aghat kii bhanti kramon main nahin aate
 CF Wagner and GD mccann have stated that the potential of clouds is often of the order of two million volts
 simpasan or scrage ne prayogon dwaara yah nishkarsh praapt kiya ki 10,000 foot kii oonchaai par sthit badalon ke vibhav kaa praaia: 50 se 100 volt prati senmi0 kii dar se patan hota he
 In the middle of the lightning process, the value of electrification varies from two to fifteen thousand amperes
 is prachand dhara ke kaaran tadit ke path main vidypan vaayu ke anu or parmaanu ynit ho jate hai or prakaash utpann karte hai
 This glow is visible to us as Damini
 yah spasht he ki vaayu se hokar badalon or prithvi ke bich vidyudvisarjan vahiin adhik sambhavya hoga jahaan vidyut ko vaayu kaa pratirodh kam se kam paar karnaa padegaa
 That is why lightning occurs mostly on high towers, tall buildings, solitary trees and flag bearers etc
 One of the reasons for this is that the closer the object is to the cloud, the greater the charge will be generated on it
 iske atirikt sapaat maidan kii apeksha minaaron, vrikshon kii chotiyon aadi ke nukile hone ke kaaran un par vidyut aavesh adhik maatra main ekatra hota he
 Traumatic electronegativity is one-way
 aghat ke lagabhaag paanch microsecond kii avadhi main hi iskaa maan ghaateey kram se badhata hua adhiktam ho jaataa he or lagbhag 25 microsecond ke andar ghatakar aadha maatr rah jaataa he
 This strong current usually lasts 100 microseconds
 iske pashchaat kramash: ghatati hui kuch sahastra ampiore tak pahunch jaati he or kuch sahasrashan second tak aisi hi bani rahati he
 If the stroke does not recur, then this stream becomes less and less
 saamanyatya tadit teen prakaar kii hoti he: Wide lightning occurs over a wide area and its continuous light spreads far enough over the clouds
 dharidaar yaa rekhawarna tadit aksar dikhalaai padati he
 It has one or more luminosities, straight or crooked, visible moving here and there
 isamen vidyudvisarjan badal se badal main, badal se dharti main athwa badal se vayumandal ke bich hota
 This light itself can be of three types: kanduk tadit ek jyotirmaya gend kii bhanti prithvi kii or aati hui dikhalaai padati he
 Its average diameter is 20 cm
 jyon-jyon vah prithvi kii ore agrasar hoti he, iskaa veg ghatata jaataa he
 After appearing for about three to five seconds, she explodes with a very loud sound
 yah bahut hi kam dikhalaai padati he or isaki utpatti kaa kaaran agyaat he
 The lightning barrage system developed by Benjamin Franklin is the best way to protect buildings from the direct trauma of lightning
 lohe kaa ek chad, jiskaa upree sira bhaale kii bhanti nukila hota he or bhawan ke kaaphi upar tak niklaa rahata he, bhawan ke parshv se hota hua bhoomi ke andar kaaphi gaharaai tak gada rahata he
 The lower end is placed in a copper plate in the ground
 yah tadit dand badal main vidyaman tadit ke liye nunatam pratirodh kaa maarg hi nahin prashast karata, pratyut yah bhawan par utpann prerit vidyudaveshon ko tatkaal prithvi ke andar pahunchaa detaa he
 Thus it also significantly reduces the possibility of mutual attraction of charges between clouds and the building
 ateet se hi vidyut jhanjhaaon ke dinon main, navik apane jalayanonke mastulon se is prakaar badalon ke vidyut kaa ksharan dekhte chale aa rahe hai
 This corrosion appears more clear at night
 ise europea navik sant almo kii agni kehete hai
 Many lightning-related experiments are being carried out these days
 ek manoranjak prayog motorcar main ek vyakti ko baitaakar or us motor par kritrim tadit upar se neeche kii ore bhejkar kiya gaya
 Since the electrons present in lightning, due to the same charge, have mutual distraction, they fall apart as they fall on the roof of the motorcar and pass through its walls into the earth below
 isse motor ke andar unki paith na ho saki or vah vyakti sarvatha surakshit rah gaya
 From this experiment, it is decided that in modern metal-framed buildings, whose foundation is very deep, the person sitting is very safe from the lightning strikes
 yadi aise bhawan, athwa taditchaalkayukt bhawan, na mil saken to aise vishaal bhawan main aashray lenaa chahie jo kaaphi vistrut ho
 During a thunderstorm, you should keep yourself away from power, stoves and other conductors of electricity
 baahar rahanewaalon ko pahadiyon ke upar, puaal ityadi ke dher par, ekaaki vrikshon ke neeche, pataakadandon ke paas, athwa kisi prakaar kii dhaatunirmit vastu ke sameep, kabhi na rahanaa chahie, na dhaatu se bani kisi vastu ko hi haath main liye rahanaa chahie
 Living in dense forests or under a sloping hill, it is absolutely safe
 yah aisi vyavastha hoti he jisamen apane upar aropit vibhav ko tatkshan gata dene kaa vishesh gun hota he
 It also prevents an increase in the intensity of the lightning current flowing through it
 isamen saadharantaya ek aantar vyavastha hoti he, jo ek pratirohak se shreneekram main sambhddha hoti he
 Its resistance decreases as the value of the current flowing in it increases
 antar yukti kaa kaary yah hota he ki vah araikhik pratirohak ko prayavarti dhara ke shaktiparipath se sthoolt: pruthak rakhti he
 The contact between these two is possible only when such a high voltage is generated which also makes the air of empty space conductive
 is prakaar tadit dhara prayavarti dhara ke shakti paripath ko kshati pahunchaae bina nirodhak se hokar prithvi ke andar sakushal pahunchaati he
