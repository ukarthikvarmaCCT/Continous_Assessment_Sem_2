 saanchaa:infobox filesystemntfs Windows NT, tathaa iske baad ke sanskarnon Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista or Windows 7 kii maanak fil pranali he
 NTFS has replaced the FAT file system as the primary file system of Microsoft's Windows operating system
 NTFS, FAT tathaa HPFS se kai myanon main behatar he kyonki yah metadata ke liye adhik sahaayak he or isamen unnat data sanrachanaon kaa prayog behatar pradarshan, vishwasaneeyata tathaa discs spes ke upyog ke liye kiya gaya he, saath hi saath kuch atirikt suvidhaayen jaise ki suraksha acces control list, va fil system jarnling bhi he
 In the mid-1980s, Microsoft and IBM formed a joint project to create graphical operating systems for the coming generation
 is pariyojna ke parinamswaroop OS / 2, bana, lekin Microsoft or IBM kai mahatvapurn muddon par asahmat ho jane kii vajah se alag ho gaye
 OS / 2 remained an IBM project
 Microsoft ne Windows NT par kaam shuru kar diya
 The OS / 2 file system HPFS had several important new features
 jab Microsoft ne apana nayaa oparating system banaaya, unhonen NTFS ke liye in main se kai avadharanaon kaa prayog kiya
 
 HPFS and NTFS use the same code type to identify disk partitions, perhaps as a result of originating from the same source
 ek hi ID kaa ek saath prayog karnaa asaamaanya he kyonki darjanon code uplabdh the or anya pramukh fil pranaaliyon ke apane code hai
 FAT has more than nine codes
 The algorithm, which identifies the file system in partition type 07, should perform additional checks
 yah bhi spasht he ki NTFS ne apane sthapaty dizin kaa kuch bhaag VMS dwaara prayukt kii jane vaali fil-11 se liya he
 This is hardly surprising since Dave Cutler was the main man working on both VMS and Windows NT
 NTFS ne paanch sanskaran jari kiye hai: V1
0 and V1
1 are incompatible, ie version 3
5x written by NT cannot be read by NT 3
1 unless NT 3
1 is updated by NT 3
5x CD, with FAT using larger file names Facility is also available
 V1
2 compresd filon, muddon tathaa ACL aadhaarit suraksha ityadi ke liye sahaayak he
 V3
0 added disk quota, encryption, sparse file, reparse points, update serial number arrangement, $ extnd folder and its files, and reorganized security descriptors so that all files that use the same security technology, the same descriptor To share it
 V3
1 expanded the entries in the master file table to replace the unusable MFT record number
 Windows Vista ne transectional NTFS, NTFS pratikatmak link, vibhaajan ke sankuchan or swayan-upachaar kii suvidha ko pesh kiya, haalanki ye suvidhaayen fil system se adhik oparating system kii atirikt kaaryakshmata se sambandhit hai
 NTFS V3
0 is equipped with many new features than its predecessors: sparse file facility, disk quota access, reparse point, distributed link tracking and file level encryption also known as encrypting file system
 USN jarnal system prabandhan kaa ek feature he jo sabhi filon, stream tathaa diarectory ko record karne ke saath unki vibhinn visheshtaon or suraksha settings ko record karata he
 This is an important functionality of NTFS to ensure that its internal complex data and inventory remain intact in the event of a system crash and provide these important data structures again when the volume is re-fixed
 Windows ke baad ke sanskarnon main, USN jarnal ne tab se NTFS fil system ke anya kriyanvan main prayukt bhaagon main is tarah kii khoj kaa vistaar karne kii cheshtaa kii he jaise ki system fil kii copy-on-rhite cementics ke saath VSS shedo pratilipi, yaa transectional NTFS or vitarit fil pranali kaa kriyanvan 
 Basically, hard links joining the POSIX subsystem in Windows NT are similar to directory junctions, but are used for files rather than directories
 hard link keval usee volum kii filon main lagu ho sakate hai kyonki fil ke MFT ricard main atirikt fil naam kaa record judaa hua he
 Short filenames are also executed as additional filename records that do not have separate directory entries
 vaikalpik data stream ek se adhik data stream ko ek fil naam ke saath, fil naam praaroop-"fil naam:strimnaam" kaa prayog kar ke jodatii he
 Optional topics are not listed in Windows Explorer and their size is not included in the file size
 jab ek fil jo email athwa website se aplod karke network share yaa FAT dwaara formet USB drive main copy kii jaati he to us fil kii keval mukhya stream hi sangrakshit hoti he
 As a result, using alternate streams for critical data can cause problems
 mailaware vaikalpik data stream kaa istemaal apane code ko chhipaane ke liye karte hai; kuch mailaware scinar or anya vishesh upkaran ab vaikalpik stream main data kii jaanch karte hai
 Very small adss are added to Internet Explorer to mark files downloaded from external sites: running them locally may be unsafe and the local system will require user confirmation before opening them
 jab yuzar yah ingit karata he use condermeshan dialog kii or aavashyaktaa nahin he, to downlod kii gayi filon ke liye MFT pravishti main is ADS ko hataa diya jaataa he
 Some media giants have also used ADS for storing custom metadata in media files to organize archiving, without modifying the effective data content of media files
 These metadata can be displayed as additional information columns in Windows Explorer with the help of a registered Windows Shell extension, which can parse them
 lekin zyaadaatar media diggaj in soochnaaon ke sangrahan ke liye ADS kii bajaae apane alag databes kaa prayog karte hai Sparse files are files that have a sparse data set and the data are mostly filled with zeros
 databes program kabhi kabhi spars filon kaa upyog karte hai
 Because of this, Microsoft has allowed a program to specify empty data fields for efficient storage of sparse files
 ek program spars fil ko saamaanya tareeke se padhata he tathaa fil system yah gananaa karata he ki fil ofaset par kya data vaapis aana chahie
 With compress files, the actual size of the sparse files is not taken into account when determining the quota limit
 NTFS LZ77 elgorithm ke ek sanskaran kaa prayog kar ke filon ko compress kar saktaa he
 Although read-write access to compressed files is transparent, Microsoft does not recommend compression on network shares with server systems and / or roaming profiles because it puts a heavy burden on the processor
 volum shadow kii pratilipi seva NTFS volum par filon tathaa foulder ke aitihaasik sanskarnon ko copy kar ke puraane, naye overrite data kii shadow copy banaati he 
 jab yuzar pehle ke sanskaran ko waapas paanaa chahta he to nayi filon par purana data vaapis aa jaataa he
 It also allows backup programs to store files that are being used by the file system
 baari lod vaale system par, Microsoft ek alag discs par shadow copy rakhane kii anushansa karata he
 In cases of frequent system crashes, VSS uses the USN Journal to mark local transactions and ensure that committed changes to files are effectively retrieved after re-inserting NTFS volumes and restarting the system
 In case the new version is not recorded due to the file being closed or the modified file safely Credit should be loaded
 However, these VSS are not syncing across multiple files or volumes without a shadow transaction coordinator
 inhen sirf yah sunishchit karne ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he ki byaap ke dauraan puraane sanskaran uplabdh rahe taaki un byaap ke dwaara system kii lagaataar chhaviyon ko praapt kiya ja sake
 In Windows Vista, programs can use transactional NTFS to convert mass changes to files into transactions
 transection sabhi parivartanon ke hone yaa na hone kii guarantee detaa he tathaa yah bhi guarantee detaa he ki bina patibaddhta ke transection ke baahar koi parivartan nahin hoga
 This volume uses the techniques used in shadow copy to retrieve overwritten data safely, and mark the USF journal log for transactions without commitments or commitments, but not fully executed transactions
 haalanki, transectional main sakasham fil system main, jab tak transection patibaddh nahin he, ise kisi bhi tarah ke partishan ke liye asthai rup se prayog kiya ja saktaa he, bajaae system filon ke jo copy-on-rhite cementics ke dwaara sthai rup se chinhit hai or apni sthaneey transection ke dwaara purna rup se sanshodhit hai
 The copy-on-write technique has been modified to effectively retract data and avoid possible fragmentation of file systems by competitors
 purana data tunrat overrite nahin hota apitu apni jagah padaa rahata he, is sthiti main keval nayaa apatibaddh data hi asthaayee shadow main rakhaa jaataa he tathaa antat lekhak dwaara transection ko puraa karne ke pashchaat saamaanya VSS copy-on-rhite kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In addition, temporary shadows for new data, which can only be seen by participating processes with unrestricted data, are written to disk immediately but can be stored in memory and changed when needed
 NTFS transection keval sthaneey NTFS volum tak hi simit nahin he balki isamen duusare sthaan ke transectional data va prakriyaayein bhi shaamil hai jaise ki duusare volum main sangrahit data, sthaneey registry, SQL databes, vartmaan sthiti main system sarvice yaa remote sarvice
 These transactions are coordinated through the network by all participants using a specific service called the Distributed Transaction Coordinator which ensures that all participants will work in the same position, and all changes are made when confirmed by a participant
 Will be extended to for example distributed file systems in transactional NTFS networks Numti gives including their local online or offline storage
 EFS NTFS volum par kisi bhi fil athwa foulder ko shaktishaalee tathaa paardarshee dhang se kutabaddh karata he
 EFS works with EFS Services, Microsoft's cryptoapi and EFS File System Run- Time Library
 EFS ek fil ko cemetric kunjee ke saath kutabaddh karata he jo isliye prayukt kii jaati he jo acemetric kunjee ke bajaae badi maatra main data ko kutabaddh athwa dicode karne main kam samay leti he
 The symmetric key, which was used to encode the file, is encoded by a user who encoded the file with the help of a public key, and this encoded data is placed in the encrypted file's alternate data stream
 
 fil ko dicode karne ke liye, fil system yuzar kii nijee kunjee kaa upyog acemetric kunjee ko dicode karne ke liye karata he jo fil hader main sangrahit hoti he
 It then uses the symmetric key to decode the file
 kyonki yah fil system ke str par kiya jaataa he, yah yuzar ke liye paardarshee he
 In addition, in case the user loses his / her key, the EFS system provides additional decode keys so that the recovery agent can use the file when needed
 The encoding and compression facilities provided by NTFS are mutually unique
 NTFS kaa prayog kisi ek athwa duusare ke liye alag upkaran ke taur par kiya ja saktaa he
 EFS is not available in the Basic, Home, and Media Center versions of Windows, and must be activated after loading the Professional, Ultimate and Server versions of Windows, or using tools provided by Enterprise in the Windows domain
 discs kota kii shuruyaat NTFS v3 se kii gayi thi
 This allows the computer administrator to run a version of Windows that allows the use of NTFS to create disk space that the user can later use
 yah administrator ko yah bhi jaanane main madad karata he ki prayek yuzar discs ke kitne sthaan kaa upyog kar rahaa he
 The administrator can set a certain level of disk space to be used by the user, after which a warning is received and the user can be denied after reaching the highest position of the space
 discs kota NTFS ke paardarshee fil sampeedan ke sakasham hone ke baavzood ise gatividhi main shaamil nahin karata
 jin program ko chalaane ke liye khaali discs sthaan kii aavashkata padati he ve yuzar ko nirdhaarit kiya gaya kota dekh sakate hai
 Disk quota is not available in the Basic, Home, and Media Center versions of Windows, and must be activated after loading the Professional, Ultimate and Server versions of Windows, or by using tools provided by Enterprise in the Windows domain
 yah suvidha NTFS v3 main pesh kii gayi thi
 They are used by adding reparse tags to the user space attribute of a file or directory
 jab object manager fil system naam lukup ko pars karata he or ripars atribute kaa saamana karata he, to yah jaanata he ki naam lukup ko ripars karnaa he tathaa yuzar dwaara niyantrit ripars data ko Windows 2000 main lod kiye gayi prayek fil system filter dryver ko bhejnaa he
 Each filter driver checks the reparse data to see if it is connected to that reparse point and in the event that it intercepts file system calls and executes its special functionality
 ripars point kaa prayog volum mount point, diarectory jankshan, sangrahan prabandhan, sanrachanaatmak sangrahan va simbolic link ko lagu karne main kiya jaataa he
 Unix is like a mount point, where the core of a file system is connected to a directory
 NTFS main, yah ek atirikt fil system ko, bina kisi drive akshar ke, badhane kii anumati detaa he
 Once the second volume of a volume is copied over the current directory, the previous contents of that directory become invisible, the root of the mounted volume is replaced by the directory
 mount hone vaala volum ke paas phir bhi swayan dwaara ghoshit drive akshar ho saktaa he
 File systems never allow volumes to be mounted on top of each other
 The volume mount point can be made continuously or not
 mount kiye gayi volum NTFS ke bajaae duusare fil system kaa prayog kar sakate hai, ve sambhawatah apni khud kii suraksha vyavastha ke saath remote dwaara share kii gayi diarectory ho sakate hai tathaa remote fil system niti ke anusaar niyantran adhikaar kii rimaiping kar sakate hai
 The volume is like a mount point, although the directory references the second directory instead of another volume in the junction file system
 udhaaharan ke liye, diarectory C: \ exampledir, diarectory jankshan atribute jiskaa link D: \ linkeddir ke saath he, yuzar mod aplication dwaara prayog kiye jane par apane aap diarectory D: \ linkeddir ko sanderbhit karegaa
 This implementation is conceptually similar to Unix's directory link, except that in NTFS the target will always be another directory and will have the characteristics of a hard link
 diarectory lagaataar judati he tathaa sarwar par hal hoti he kyonki ve sthaneey system yaa domen, jis par parent volum mount he, ke samaan suraksha kshetra ko baantate hai tathaa lakshya diarectory kii saamagree ke anusaar apni saamagree kii suraksha vyavastha karte hai, haalaanki jankshan kii alag suraksha vyavastha ho sakati he
 When a link to a directory junction is removed, the files in the target directory are not deleted
 diarectory jankshan soft link hote hai, tathaa simbolic links ke simit rup main kaary karte hai, lekin yah ek anukulit sanskaran he jo ripars point kii prakriya ko kriyanvan ke dauraan tej karata he tathaa naye NTFS simbolic links se kam kharche par chalata he tathaa ise sarwar par hal kiya ja saktaa he
 Symbolic links were introduced in Windows Vista
 simbolic links graahak chor par hal kiye jate hai
 Therefore, when a symbolic link is shared, the target is subject to the access restrictions of the client, not the server
 simbolic links filon athwa diarectory main banaaye ja sakate hai, kintu link kaa arth nirmit link ke saath uplabdh karaayaa janaa chahie
 But the target does not have to exist or be available when the symbolic link is created
 jab simbolic link kii jaanch hogi tathaa lakshya ko uplabdhta ke liye jaancha jayega, NTFS bhi jaanch karegaa ki iskaa prakaar sahi he yaa nahin 
 lakshya kaa prakaar galat hone kii sthiti main yah nahin-mila kii truti darshaayegaa
 They can point to the directory shared on the remote host or to the files or subdirectories of that directory
 boot karne par unka lakshya ekadam se nirdhaarit nahin hota balki openfile yaa createfileapi ke saath kholane par asthaayee rup se uplabdh hota he
 Their definition is continuous on the NTFS volume where they originate
 
 Many directories may have different but similar files, some of these files may contain similar content
 ekal charan sangrahan samaan filon kaa ek fil main vilay karne or vilay fil sandarbh banane kii anumati detaa he
 SIS has a file system filter that manages copies, modifications, and mergers of files, and a user space service that finds files that are the same, and that need to be merged
 SIS mukhya rup se remote installation sarwar ke liye dijin kiya gaya tha kyonki inaki bahut adhik installation chhaviyaan hoti hai jinamein kai ek jaisi filein ho sakati hai
 SIS collects these, but unlike a hard link example, each file is different, making changes to one copy of the file does not affect the changes on the other files
 yah copy-on-rhite takanic ke samaan he jisamen ek copy ke sanshodhit hone tak memory puri tarah se copy nahin hoti
 Branched storage management is a means of transferring files that have not been in use for some period of time to a less expensive storage system
 jab fil ko agali baar kholaa jaataa he to fil kaa ripars point isaki aavashyaktaa nirdhaarit karata he or ise sangrahan se praapt karata he
 NSS was an activex document storage technology that was stopped by Microsoft
 yah activex dastavezon ko ek hi multi stream praaroop main sangrahan kii anumati detaa tha jise activex aantarik rup se upyog karata he
 An NSS file system filter was loaded and used to send multiple streams transparently to the program and when the file was sent to a non-ntfs formatted disk volume, it also moved multiple streams with a single stream
 gave
 iske kriyanvan ke liye koi vivaran jari nahin kiya gaya jis se tisare paksh ke vikritaon ke liye NTFS ko sanbhaalane ke tul uplabdh karana mushkil bana diya
 The ability to read and write NTFS is provided by the NTFS-3G driver
 yah zyaadaatar Linux vitaran main shaamil he
 Other older and mostly read-only solutions also exist: dhyaan den ki sabhi teen yuzaraspes driver, arthath ntfsmount, NTFS-3 ji or captive ntfs,fil system par yuzaraspes main bane hai, joki ek Linux modul he jise yuzaraspes kii brijing tathaa Kernel code ko seve karne tathaa data punah praapt karne kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he

 For example, trying to get a previous version on an NTFS partition on an operating system that is not supported will result in losing the contents of the previous version
 opensolaris, ecomstation, kolibrios, or freebsd keval padhane ke liye NTFS sport dete hai 
 ek anya teesraa upkaran beos, jo NTFS-3G par aadhaarit tha, NTFS ke liye padhane or likhane kii anumati detaa he
 NTFS-3G also works on Mac OS X, freebsd, netbsd, Solaris and Haiku in addition to Linux via FUSE
 ek muft nijee prayog ke liye padhane / likhane kaa MS-DOS kaa dryver "NTFS4DOS" bhi maujuud he
 Microsoft currently provides a tool that converts HPFS, FAT16 Windows 2000 and higher versions, and FAT32 into NTFS, but there is no other way
 vibhinn teesri party upkaran bhi surakshit NTFS partishan risaising main sakasham hai
 Microsoft has added the ability to shrink and enlarge partitions in Windows Vista, but this capability is limited because it will not delete page file fragments or non-moving files, so the ability to shrink partitions is limited
 ek pej fil ke bina ribooting yaa difregment karne ke liye kisi tisare tul kaa upyog sthiti ko kharaab kar saktaa he yadi pej fil hatane vaali fil nahin he
 For historical reasons, versions of Windows that do not support NTFS all keep time internally as a local time zone, and the rest of the file system, except NTFS, does the same as the current version of Windows is supporting
 tathaapi, Windows NT or aane vaale sanskaran UTC ke rup main aantarik time stamps rakhte hai or pradarshan ke liye upyukt parivartan karte hai
 Therefore, UTC has NTFS time stamps
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jab filein NTFS or non-ntfs partishan ke bich copy yaa sthanantarit kii jaati he, to OS ko fli par time stamps badalane kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 But if some files are moved when under day-light saving time and if some files are transferred under standard time then there may be discrepancies during the conversion
 parinamswaroop, kisi ek din baad jab sthaneey samay kshetra badalata he, yuzar yah jaan sakate hai ki kuch filon ke time stamps main 1 ghante kii galati he
 Due to the differences between the northern and southern hemispheres in implementing DST, a possible timestamp of up to 4 hours could be an error in any 12 months
 NTFS main, sabhi fil data - fil naam, nirmaan tithi, niyantran anumati or saamagree-master fil talika main metadata ke rup main jamaa ho jaataa he
 This feature made it possible to easily add file system features during the development of the Windows NT file system
 - active diarectory software dwaara indexing ke liye fields ko jodna ek dilachasp udhaaharan he
 NTFS allows any sequence of 16-bit values for name encoding
 This means that UTF-16 code points are supported, but the file system does not check that the sequence is a valid UTF-16
 aantarik rup se, NTFS fil system data ko index karne ke liye bi+ tree kaa upyog karata he
 Although it is difficult to implement, in most cases it finds the file faster
 ek fil system jarnal fil system metadata kii akhandta kii guarantee detaa he lekin vyaktigat filon kii saamagree kii nahin
 Systems that use NTFS are considered more reliable than FAT file systems
 master fil talika har fil, diarectory or NTFS volum par metafil kii metadata ke rup main jaankaree rakhti he
 It also includes file name, location, size and permissions
 isaki sanrachana elgoridam, jo discs vikhandan kam se kam karti he, kaa samarthan karti he
 a directory entry consists of a file name and a "file ID" that displays the record number of the file in the master file table
 fil ID ginati kaa punah prayog puraane sandarbhon kaa pataa lagane ke liye karte hai
 Although it resembles the W_FID of file-11 highly, other NTFS structures look fundamentally different
 NTFS kai filon se mil kar bana he jo fil system ko paribhaashit tathaa vyavasthit karti hai
 In all cases, these files are made just like any other user files, but file system customers are not directly interested in them
 These meta files define files, backup important files of file system data, And changes to buffer file systems, free space allocation management, meeting BIOS requirements, finding bad allocation units, security and disk space Do not use information that the task of storage
 jab tak kahin ore ingit na kii jaayen, sabhi saamagree ek anaam data stream main he
 These meta files are used exclusively by Windows and are difficult to see directly: special tools are required to view them
 MFT record main varnit prayek fil ke liye stream discriptor kaa ek bhandar he, jo ek anishchit lambaai ke record, main ek saath pack hote hai, har MTF record ko bharne ke liye nishchit 1KB saise kii pading hoti he or yah fil ke saath prabhavi streems ke vishay main varnan karte hai
 Each stream has a single type or file controlled by the Create API Call program), an optional single stream name, and optional data associated with that stream
 For NTFS, the file's standard data, or the directory's index data, are handled in the same way as other data streams or standard attributes
 ve keval ek yaa kai atribute suchi main sangrahit atribute main se ek hai
 To increase storage capacity and reduce i / o expenses of connected streams with smaller data, NTFS prioritizes inserting data into the stream descriptor rather than listing clusters through MTF entries
 
 is cese main stream discriptor sidhe hi data ko sangrahit nahin karegaa lekin ek aabantan maanchitr par sangrahan karegaa jo volum par anyatra sangrahit data ko ingit karegaa
 When stream data can be obtained directly from the stream descriptor, it is called "resident data" by computer forensics workers
 data kii maatra fil visheshtaon par bahut nirbhar he, lekin chote fil naam tathaa bina ACL ke 700-800 bits single stream filon main aam he
 The NTFS file system driver sometimes attempts to insert non-resident streams into the stream repository and also inserts the stored stream descriptors in the non-resident repository into the stream repository of the MFT record
 yah prayaas praathamikta or praathamikta ke aadhaar par aadesh ke niyam or aakaar par nirbhar hai
 Since resident files do not occupy a cluster, it is possible to have more file names than a cluster on an NTFS volume
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek 80 GB partishan ke 4kib ke 19,543,064 cluster ho sakate hai
 After subtracting the system files, 19,526,158 clusters are empty for files and lists
 kyonki ek cluster main 4 MFT record hai, yah volum saidhantik rup se lagbhag 4 × 19,526,158 = 78,104,632 racident filon ko sambhaal saktaa he

 Prof
 Rajendra Singh was the fourth Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which is known as Rajju Bhaiya everywhere from the common people to the Sangh Parivar
 ve elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main 1939 se 1943 tak vidhyaarthee rahe
 Subsequently, from 1943 to 1967, he was appointed first spokesman in the Physics Department, then Professor and finally Head of the Department
 rajju bhaiya bharat ke mahaan ganitagya harishchandra ke bi0essi0 or em0essi0 main sahpaathee the
 Rajju Bhaiya was born on 29 January 1922 in Engineers Colony, Shahjahanpur City, Uttar Pradesh, from the womb of Jwala Devi, the wife of Ind Balbir Singh
 us samay unke pitaaji balbir singh vahaan sichaai vibhaag main abhiyanta ke rup main tainaat the
 Balbir Singh ji was originally a resident of Banail Pahasu village of Bulandshahr district of Uttar Pradesh, who later retired from the post of Chief Engineer from the Irrigation Department of Uttar Pradesh
 ve bhartiya ejineering seva main chaynit hone vaale pratham bhartiya the
 According to the family's tradition, all the children used to address their mother Jwala Devi as "jiaji"
 apane mata-pita kii kul paanch santaanon main rajju bhaiya tisare the
 He had two elder sisters - Sushila and Chandravati and two younger brothers - Vijender Singh and Yatindra Singh were in the Indian Administrative Service and held high positions in the central and state government
 ek pustak main unhone yah rahasyodghatan us samay kiya tha jab ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalak ke pad ko sushobhit kar rahe the pathakon kii jaankaree hetu ye tathy usee pustak se jyon ke tyon uddhrut kiye ja rahe hai: "my father was an engineer in Shahjahanpur around 1921-22
 unke sameep hi ejiniyaron kii us colony main kakori kand ke ek pramukh sahyogi shri premakrishna khanna ke pita shri rhibahadur ramakrishna khanna bhi rahete the
 Shri Ram Prasad along with 'bismil' Premkrishna Khanna often used to come to meet the people of this colony
 mere pitaaji mujhe bataaya karte the ki 'bismil' ji ke prati sabhi ke man main apaar shraddha thi
 His life was very pure and simple, due to regular yoga and exercise daily, the body was very strong and powerful and the mouth was filled with vigor and strength

 Rajendra Singh Sarsanghchalak Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh rajju bhaiya kii sangh yatra asaamaanya he
 He came to Prayag in his youth with a vigilant and fully developed merit power in his youth

 paas karte hi ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main vyaakhyaata pad paane ke saath-saath prayag ke nagar kaayrvah kaa daayitv sanbhaalane kii sthiti main pahunch gayi
 Prayag Department's proceedings in 1946, Jail Yatra in 1948, Divisional Affairs in 1949 comprising two three departments, Province Work in 1952 and Bhaurao Deoras in 1954, took over the responsibility of the entire province after leaving the province
 1961 main bhaurav ke waapas lautne par praant-prachaarak kaa daayitv unhen waapas dekar sah praant-prachaarak ke rup main pun:unke sahyogi bane
 If the scope of Bhaurao expanded, then again from 1962 to 1965, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh's pracharak, from 1966 to 1974, he was the field-preacher and field-preacher
 1975 se 1977 tak apatkaal main bhumigat rahakar loktantr kii vaapasi kaa aandolan khadaa kiya
 When he became a co-government in 1977, Madhavrao Mule was also given the responsibility of head-work in March 1978
 1978 se 1987 tak is daayitv kaa nirvaah karke 1987 main ho0 ve0 sheshadri ko yah daayitv dekar sah-sarkarywah ke rup main unke sahyogi bane
 In 1994, when the then Sarsanghchalak Bala Saheb Deoras started looking for his successor due to his declining health, everyone's eyes were fixed on Rajju Bhaiya and on 11 March 1994, Bala Saheb automatically handed over the top responsibility of Sarsanghchalak to him
 sangh ke itihaas main yah ek asaamaanya ghatana thi
 The eyes of the publicity media and the critics of the Sangh were torn by seeing this scene
 unhen vishwaas hi nahin ho rahaa tha ki jis rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par ve ab tak maharashtriyan brahmanon ke ekadhikaar kii chhavi thopate aaye hai, uske shikhar par uttar bharat kaa koi gaiyr-maharashtrin abrahman pahunch saktaa he - vah bhi sarvasammati se
 Rajju Bhaiya's body was diseased and relaxed at that time, but he made a lot of effort to fulfill the responsibility entrusted to him
 parantu ahernish kaary or samaaj-chintan se buree tarah tut chuke apane sharir se bhala or kab tak kaam liya ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, in 1999, he made up his mind to hand over the responsibility to someone younger
 or ant main apane sahyogiyon ke aagrahpurn anurodh kaa aadar karte hue ek varsh kii pratiksha ke baad, march 2000 main sudarshan ji ko yah daayitv saupakar svaichhik pad-sanyas kaa sangh ke samaksh ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Rajju Bhaiyya's 60-year long Sangh Yatra is not only unusual in terms of how he has successfully carried out huge responsibilities one after the other, but also with the view that from 1943 to 1966 he was with teaching work at Prayag University- Like a full-time evangelist, he wandered from place to place, carrying out all the responsibilities
 sangh-kaary hetu apni kshamta ko badhaane ke liye ve sangh shiksha varg main teen varsh ke paramparaagat prashikshan par nirbhar nahin rahe
 He received his first year training in 1947 when he had reached the status of city stewardship of Prayag
 Had prepared for tritiy varsh unhone 1957 main kiya jab ve uttar pradesh jaise bade praant kaa daayitv sanbhaal rahe the
 It is clear from this that he did the formality of training for three years to present a worthy example in front of other volunteers of the Sangh, not to gain merit for himself
 prayag vishvavidhyalay main padhaate hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main prachaarkavat jute rahe
 He was formally declared a pracharak in 1958, but the truth is that he himself gave the role of pracharak to the office of stewardship
 bhautik shaastra jaise good vishay par asaamaanya adhikaar rakhane ke saath-saath atyant saral va rochak adhyaapan style or apane shishyon ke prati sneh bhaavana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya prayag vishvavidhyalay ke sarvaadhik lokapriy or safal praadhyaapak the
 Due to seniority and qualification, he also had to hold the responsibility of the post of chairman of the department along with the professor
 kintu yah sab karte hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah puri tarah karte rahe
 He never wished to become a reader or a professor
 jin dinon prayag vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee vibhaag ke reader pad ke liye aavden maange gayi unhone aavedan patr hi nahin diya
 The colleagues asked that Rajju brother! Why did you do it? So he answered very easily - "oh my life work is union work, not a university professor
 abhi main saptaah main chaar din kakshayen letaa hoon, teen din sangh-kaary ke liye daura karata hoon
 Sometimes even after trying hard, the university is unable to reach on time
 abhi to vibhaag ke sab adhyaaapak meraa sahyog karte hai kintu yadi main reader pad par abhyaarthee bana to ve mujhe apana pratispardhi samajhane lagenge
 So why get stuck in this digestion
 " rajju bhaiya kaa sampoorn jivan is baat kaa sakshi he ki unhen pad kii aakanksha athwa uskaa moh kabhi rahaa hi nahin
 Even as a teacher in the university, he did not earn for himself
 ve apane vetan kii ek-ek pai ko sangh-kaary par vyay kar dete the
 Even after being born into a rich family, getting education in public schools, interest in sports like music and cricket, he used to spend least on himself
 mitvyayta kaa ve apurv udhaaharan the
 At the end of the year, whatever was left of his salary, he was offered to the society as guru-dakshina
 ek baar rashtradharm prakaashan aarthik sankat main fas gaya to unhone apane pitaaji se aagrah karke apane hisse kii dhanrashi dekar rashtradharm prakaashan ko sankat se ubaara
 This was an expression of his all-round sanity! ni:swaarth sneh or nishkaam karm sadhana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya sabake priy tha
 Both within and outside the union
 purushottam das tandon or laal bahadur shastri jaise rajanetaaon ke saath-saath prabhudutt brahmacharee jaise santon kaa vishwaas or sneh bhi unhone arjeet kiya tha
 Along with a very sensitive conscience, Rajju Bhaiyya was also very realistic
 ve kisi se bhi koi bhi baat nixsancoach kah dete the or unki baat ko taalna kathin ho jaataa tha
 After the Emergency, when it was decided to give Nanaji Deshmukh the post of Minister of Industry in the Janata Party government, Rajju Bhaiya told him that if Nanaji will go into the government if you, Atalji and Advaniji - then who will take care of the organization by staying outside? Respecting his wish, Nanaji immediately turned down the mantripad and accepted to be the general secretary of the Janata Party
 chaahe atalji hon, yaa adwaniji; ashokaji sinhal hon, yaa dattopant thengdiji - harek sheersh netaa rajju bhaiya kii baat kaa aadar karata tha; kyonki uske peeche swaarth, kutilata yaa gutbandi kii bhaavana nahin hoti thi
 From this point of view, Rajju Bhaiya was indeed a link connecting not only the Bodhi tree but all of the Sangh Parivar, but a source of moral strength and influence
 unke chale jane se keval sangh hi nahin apitu bharat ke saarvajanik jivan main ek yug kaa ant ho gaya he
 Rajju Bhaiya was not just the body of the bones
 ve swayan main dhyeynishtha, sankalp va murtimant adarshavaad kii saakshaat pratimurti the
 Therefore Rajju Bhaiya will always live in the conscience of all
 dekha jaye to rajju bhaiya aaj mar kar bhi amar hai
 Rajju Bhaiyya was very sad that our leaders could not build a grand memorial in this country in the name of revolutionary 'bismil'
 ve turki ke rashtriya smarak jaisaa smarak bharat kii rajdhani dilli main bana hua dekhnaa chaahate the

 bhartiya hindu kisi devi - devtaa kii aradhana karen yaa na karen, puja-havan karen yaa na karen, aadi swatantraaaon par dharm yaa samskruti ke naam par kabhi koi bandhan nahin lagaaye gaye

 The body is mortal, the soul is immortal, this immortality is associated with salvation, and to attain this salvation, it is also necessary to make effort for the meaning and work
 is prakaar bhartiya samskruti main dharm or moksh aadhyatmik sandesh evam arth or kaam kii bhautik anivaaryta paraspar sambaddh he
 This syncretism of spirituality and materiality reflects the specific concept of Indian culture, which was created by Indian mystics to make this folk and the hereafter happy
 sukhi maanav-jivan ke liye aisi chintaa vishwa kii anya samskritiyaan nahin karatin
 Through the complete genres of literature, music and art, this spiritual and physical co-ordination of Indian culture can be easily understood

 We cannot think that there is only one way to live and that is the true path
 sah-astitv kii aavashyaktaa ne vibhinn samskritiyon or vishwaason ke sah-astitv ko bhi aavashyak bana diya he
 Therefore, before we make such a mistake, it would be better to know other cultures as well as understand our culture as well
