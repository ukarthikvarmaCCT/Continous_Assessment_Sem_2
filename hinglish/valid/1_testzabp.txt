kshuricopanishad krishna yajurvedic shakha ke antargat ek upanishad he
 This Upanishad is written in Sanskrit language
 iske rachiyata vaidic kaal ke rishiyon ko mana jaataa he parantu mukhyat vedavyas ji ko kai upanishdon kaa lekhak mana jaataa he
 There is no opinion of scholars regarding the creation of Upanishads
 kuch upanishdon ko vedon kii mul samhitaon kaa ansh mana gaya he
 They are the most ancient
 kuch upanishad ‘brahman’ or ‘aaranyak’ granthon ke ansh maane gayi hai
 His creation is later than the codes
 upanishdon ke kaal ke vishay me nishchit mat nahi he samaanyat upanishdo kaa kaal rachanakaal 3000 isa purv se 500 isa purv mana gaya he
 The following main facts have been considered as the basis for the decision of the Upanishads- nimna vidwaanon dwaara vibhinn upanishdon kaa rachana kaal nimna kram main mana gaya he- The Grenadian monarchy is the constitutional monarchy of Grenada
 grenada ekadhidaruk ko grenada or united kingdom samet kul 15 prajabhumiyon, kaa sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler has been Queen Elizabeth II since 6 February 1952

 Grenada is theoretically a monarchy, and the ruler of Grenada is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all of the constitutional powers of the governor-general of Grenada as his representative
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " grenada kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " grenada ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in Grenada dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and colonized it in various corners of the world

 Those countries which considered the former colony, the British ruler, as their ruler even today, are called Commonwealth of Nations or Commonwealth Territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhitvatmak kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 The rules related to succession can be changed only by the Parliamentary Act, which is mandatory to be passed with the approval of all subjects
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession
 grenada kii sarkaar samprabhu, rajpariwaar yaa desh ke baahar sthit shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav ke samarthan hetu kisi bhi prakaar kii aarthik sahaayta nahin pradaan karti he
 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general

 The same thing can be said in this way that political economics studies intelligent decisions which are taken in the context of political and economic institutions
 is adhyayan main tarksangat aadhaaron kii roshni main samshtigat prabhaavon par gaur kiya jaataa he
 Originally, the study of production and trade, and their method, practice, relation to government and distribution of national income and wealth, was called 'political economics'
 raajnneetik arthshaastra kii utpatti naitik darshan se hui
 It was developed in the eighteenth century for the purpose of studying the economy or polity of the state, hence the name 'political economy'
 attharahavin sadi ke madhya main prakashit adam smith kii rachana velth of neshans se lekar unnisvin sadi main prakashit jon stuart mil kii rachana principles of political iconomi or karl marks kii rachana 'capital : a critic of political iconomi' tak ke lambe daur main arthshaastra kaa anushaasan mukhya taur se 'raajnneetik arthshaastra' ke naam se hi janaa jaataa tha
 Indeed, sociologists were of the opinion that political factors do not necessarily have an impact on economic outcomes but rather have a decisive effect
 beesvin sadi main raajnneetishastra or arthshaastra ke anushaasan alag hote chale gayi
 Under the influence of neoclassical economics, methods of economics evolved to be relatively autonomous from politics, and the emphasis of economists was on the governmental control over consumers and companies, and the conditions of market development
 abhi pichley kuch dashakon se ek baar phir raajnneeti or arthshaastra ke gathjod kii baaten hone lagi hai or naye raajnneetik arthshaastra kii charchaa sunaayi dene lagi he
 The special thing in this new emergence of political economics is that it uses sophisticated analytical methods of modern economics to underline the economic significance of politics
 aarthik vigyaan ke itihaaskaaron ke mutabik political iconomi kaa pad pehali baar 1615 main monkretin da vataville dwaara prayog kiya gaya tha
 This mercantilist scholar of France wanted the definition of economic science to be taken out of the boundaries within which Greek thinkers have limited it
 pracheen unaniyon ke anusaar arthshaastra kaa kshetra ghar-karch tak simit tha
 Monkretin also added to this idea the contemplation ie politics surrounding the institution of the state
 1761 main sar james stuart pehle angrez arthshaastri the jinhone is pad kaa ullekh apni pustak 'ain inquairi intu da principles of political iconomi' ke sheershak main kiya
 Adam Smith's view was that the task of political economics is to make provision for providing sufficient income to the people for living and on the other hand, to provide enough revenue for the government to fulfill its public objectives
 raajnneetik arthshaastra ko smith dwaara di gayi paribhaasha ke daayre se nikaal kar kahin vyapak arth dene kaa kaam karl marks ne kiya
 His contemporary J
S
 Mill was not interested in criticism of capitalism, but he interpreted political economics in terms of value, trade, money, population, salary, economic system, and economic policy
 par marks ne british raajnneetik arthshaastra se grahan kiya ki aarthik vinimay tabhi samtamulak ho saktaa he jab donon pakshon dwaara lagaaya gaya shram-mulya baraabar ho
 But, when one party is the buyer of labor and the other is the seller of labor, then the buyer of labor always makes a lot of profit in any exchange
 isi laabh ke dam par uske paas uttarottar poonji jamaa hoti chali jaati he
 This capital accumulation has profound and far-reaching economic-social consequences and social structures of dominance and subordination are born from its womb
 darasal, marks jis uljhan kaa hal suza rahe the, vah kabhi arestu ne apni nicomacian ithiks main uthaayi thi
 Aristotle's discourse contained the seeds of modern political economics
 arestu kaa kahana tha ki do log jab kinhin do chizon kaa aapas main vinimay karte hai to unamem se ek behatar or ek kamatar hoti hi he
 In such a situation, either side is bound to benefit more than the other
 unka sawaal tha ki donon ke laabhon ko baraabar kaise kiya jaae, kyonki laabhon kii asamta ek visham samaaj ko janm de sakati he
 Aristotle did not have a solution to this problem
 marks kaa yug to rashtron ke vikaas kaa yug tha, isliye unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki poonjeewaad bade paimaane par sampatti jamaa karata chalaa jaataa he or ek mukaam par pahunch kar raashtra ke vikaas main mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Lenin expanded the same idea of marx and showed how capitalism expanded its international reach through colonialism and imperialism
 marks or lenin ke vimarsh kaa laabh uthaa kar arthshaastri kai tarah kii radical dharanaon kaa pratipaadan kar paye
 They systematically merged politics and economics, examining the nature of capitalism and the intentions of political parties

 The process of sharing of resources was also explained by different governments

 In the fifties, Richard M
 Titmus divided the philanthropic state on Europe's land into three models
 unhone bataaya ki anglo-sexn desh lok upkaar kii raajnneeti keval tabhi apanaate hai jab bazaar vifal ho jaataa he
 It is a partial kind of public favor
 germany or nederland jaise deshon main lok upkaar kii raajnneeti arthshaastra main audyogic uplabdhiyon ko behatar banane ke liye mishrit kii jaati he
 In Scandivenian countries, the politics of public favor is done in an institutional redistributive model
 haal hi main lokopkaaree rajya kii vyakhya kalyankari poonjeewaad ke rup main bhi kii gayi he
 In The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, Gösta esping-andersen illustrates the capitalist roots of the philanthropic state, showing that these models are of the liberal, conservative and socio-democratic kind
 beesvin sadi ke madhya main hue nio-clasical arthshaastra ne raajnneetik arthshaastra ke vipareet raajnneeti ke prabhaav se swatantra aarthik vigyaan kii vakaalat kii
 In the era of this trend, perhaps Joseph Schumpeter's work Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy was a work that implied that the study of economics is linked to the study of politics
 bazaar kii vifaltaa kii roshni main raajnneetik arthshaastra ne pichley kuch dashakon main apni daavedaari phir se pesh kii he
 a great proof of this was found when three economists gave separate speeches while taking Nobel Prize in December 2007
 teenon ne apane-apane tareekon se raajnneetik sansthaaon or aarthik sansthaaon ke ekikaran kii zarurat ko rekhaankit hi nahin kiya balki yah bhi kaha ki yah ekikaran aam taur par ho chukaa he
 He said that after all, both types of institutions represent their respective systems, there is interdependence between them and both play an essential role in achieving results
 meresan kaa kahana tha ki arthshaastra ko pramukhataa deni aavashyak he, par yah use raajnneeti se kaat kar nahin di ja sakati
 Each social institution is created by combining different types of incentives from economic and political aspects
 behatar saamaajik sanstha vah hoti he jisamen yah mishran budhimaneepurvak kiya jaataa he
 Only then is she able to make active and coordinated efforts to overcome wrong decisions and various obstacles
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki arthshaastra or raajnneetishastra ke algaav ne gyaan ke kshetra ko viksit karne main ahm yogadan kiya he
 Many generations of scholars have presented many theories and ideas without studying each other independently and autonomously
 is prakriya main naye or behatar vishleshnatmak pariprekshyon main vishay ko punah paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 But, from a practical point of view, this separation never opened the way to the development of purely economic or purely political science
 ab ek baar phir donon ke ekikaran kii charchaa hone lagi he, haalaanki donon hi anushasano ke vidwaan pehle se hi parasparavyapee kshetron main karyrat hai
 Even in neoliberal policies this dependence has increased

 Metals are said to be because they hold the body

 Australia and New Zealand had also bid for the competition and a successful Australasian bid for the 2011 World Cup could result in a 50-50 split in the game, with the final match deal still remaining
 The bid by Trans Tasman, Beyond Borders, was the only bid for 2011 that reached the ICC headquarters in Dubai ahead of the March 1 deadline

 The New Zealand government had also assured that Zimbabweans would also be given a chance to participate in the competition, due to the ongoing political dispute in the country in which it was discussed that their country would visit Zimbabwe in 2005
 But should we get permission to go or not

 ICC President Ehsan Mani said that the extra time taken by the Asian bloc to give its approval book for the bid has hurt the four-country bids
 haalanki, jab matdaan kaa samay aayaa to asia ne teen maton kii tulana main saat mat praapt karke mejabani kaa adhikaar jeet liya
 The Pakistan Cricket Board revealed the fact that it was the deciding vote of the West Indies Cricket Board which changed the whole issue as it supported the bidding of Asia with four bidding countries, including South Africa and Zimbabwe
 pakistani akhbaar don main yah khabar di gayi ki asian deshon ne 2007 vishwa cap ke dauraan west indian cricket ke liye kosh ekatrit karne kaa vachan diya he, jisane matdaan kii prakriya ko prabhavit kiya
 However, the chairman of the Asian dialect supervision committee, I
S
 Bindra said that he had 40 crore U
S
 dollars in the region
 The promise of additional dollar gains was the reason for the change of vote and it was "not done in return for their support", as well as "that the West Indies had nothing to do with the World Cup bid"

 The World Cup has been hosted by England, India / Pakistan 1987, Australia / New Zealand 1992, India / Pakistan / Sri Lanka 1996, England 1999, South Africa 2003, West Indies 2007, so far

 India won the final vote as they argued in their favor that they should have more opportunities to host the World Cup as their group of nations is larger
 is kaaran, australia / newjiland ko 2015 ke vishwa cap kii mejabani de di gayi
 Later in 2007, the four nations agreed to a new revised format for the 2011 World Cup, similar to the 1996 World Cup, with the only difference being that the number of teams participating in 1996 was 12, while in 2011 The number of participating teams increased to 14
 pratiyogita kaa pehla charan ek round robin hoga jisame 14 timen 2 samoohon main vibhajit kii jaayengi, prayek samooh main 7 timen hongi| sabhi 7 timen ek-ek baar, ek duusare ke saath khelengi or donon samoohon main se sheersh chaar timen quarter final main khilne ke liye aharta praapt karengi
 This format ensures that a team must play at least 6 matches even if they are eliminated from the competition at the beginning of the competition

 On 17 April 2009, the ICC withdrew the right to jointly host the World Cup from Pakistan, due to ongoing concern over the "precarious security arrangements" prevailing there, especially in the wake of the 2009 terrorist attacks in Lahore during Sri Lanka's visit
 This happened as a result
 pakistan cricket board ne yah sanket die ki yadi unase bharat main khilne ko kaha gaya to vah vishwa cap main hissaa lene se inkaar sakate hai
 However, there is no concrete evidence as to whether this will actually happen
 yah anumaanit he ki pratiyogita kii mejabani chhin jane se pisibi ko 1 karod 5 lakh dollar kaa nuksaan hoga
 The figure is just under match fee of $ 7,50,000 which was guaranteed by the ICC

 Sultan Alauddin demanded Rao Hammir to hand over these rebels, Hammir turned down his demand

 Alauddin's army first attacked Chhangarh
 unka yahan aasaani se adhikaar ho gaya
 After hearing this news, Hammir sent troops from Ranthambore to Chhangarh

 The Muslim army fled after being defeated, the Chauhans looted their looted wealth and weapons

 Lenin received widespread notoriety as the leader of the Battle of the Bolsheviks in Russia
 vah 1917 se 1924 tak soviet rus ke, or 1922 se 1924 tak soviet sangh ke bhi "head of government" rahe
 Under his administration, Russia, and then the wider Soviet Union as well, became a one-party communist state controlled by the Russian Communist Party

 After encouraging rebellion during Russia's failed 1905 revolution, he launched a campaign at the time of World War I, which was to be converted into a proletarian revolution, Europe-wide, because as a Marxist he believed this opposition to capitalism Will overthrow, and cause the establishment of socialism

 While in exile, Lenin wrote thirty books, one of which was "the Development of Capitalism in Russia"

 In 1905-07, at the time of Russia's first revolution, he directed the work of the Bolsheviks in raising the masses and moving towards the goal
 avasar milte hi november, 1905 main vah rus laut aayaa
 He gave full strength to prepare for the armed rebellion and conducted the Central Committee activity and gave several speeches in the meetings of laborers working in the mines and mills

 usne yah spasht kar diya ki samrajyavad ke yug main poonjeewaad ke aarthik evam raajnneetik vikaas kii gati sab deshon main ek si nahin hoti
 On this basis, he concluded that initially the victory of socialism was possible only in two or three, or only one, capitalist countries separately

 In October the splinter of the Provisional Government of the Opposition was reversed and on 7 November 1917, the Soviet Government was established under the chairmanship of Lenin
 prarambh se hi soviet shashan ne shantisthapana par bal dena shuru kiya
 He made a treaty with Germany; Ownership of the nation was established over land, snatching land from the landlords, workers' control over businesses and factories and nationalization of banks and transportation

 Even at the time of this widespread unrest and civil war, Lenin planned to set up large farms on the basis of cooperation committees by removing the ruin of the country from the war period, improving the situation, developing electrification, expanding means of transport and mixing small holdings
 Started usne shasnic yantra kaa aakaar ghataane, usamen sudhaar karne tathaa kharch main kami karne par bal diya
 He urged the educated and mystical class to take an active part in the construction work of the new society by collaborating with the farmers and laborers

 He said that "the goal of all our policy and propaganda should be that no matter what happens, our countrymen should not be thrown into the fire of war
" ladaai kaa khaatmaa kar dene kii ore hi hamen agrasar hona chahie
 "he stressed the strengthening of the defense system to defend the country from the enemies of communism and urged Soviet citizens to have a sense of international fraternity with workers living in all other countries of the world for the establishment of" genuine "democracy and socialism

 He had considerable ideological importance with marxism-leninism and had a special place in the international communist movement

 Lenin has been denied to Lenin by his birth
 aaj bhi kai desho main lenin ke hinsak rukh ko apana rakhaa he iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan he uttar korea 
 Lenin is considered a communist but in reality he wanted a violent system
 lenin ke vichaaro se bahut se log sahamat ho sakate he
 But now many people disagree with his violent views
 isko is prakaar dekha ja saktaa he kii vibhinn desho se lenin kii murat hataai ja rahi he
 Russia also does not consider him its motivator
 ek raashtra ke liye ek rashtravaadi vichaardhaara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But Lenin, during the war, appealed to the people of Rasiya to take up scripture against Rasiya, which is a declaration for any nation
 isaliye lenin ko rashtravaadi na maanakar ek hinsak aatankwaad ke janak ke rup main dekhnaa uchit hoga
 Yes, it is true that Lenin had an influence on politics, but the bigger truth is that the violent ideology of Lenin is being eradicated today, and the nationalist ideology of proper peace and non-violence is being adopted
 jo kisi bhi raashtra ke liye shreshth kaary he

 Plays in Hindi are thought to begin with Bharatendu Harishchandra
 us kaal ke bharatendu tathaa unke samakaleen naatakakaron ne lok chetana ke vikaas ke liye naatakon kii rachana kii isliye us samay kii saamaajik samasyaon ko naatakon main abhivyakt hone kaa acha avasar mila
 As has been said, the creation of non-commercial literary theater in Hindi can be considered from the geographical metaphor called 'inder Sabha' of 'amanat' Lakhanvi
 par sach to yah he ki ‘inder sabha’ kii vastav main rangamanchi kriti nahin thi
 It used to have an open stage under the canopy
 nautanki kii tarah teen ore darshak baithte the, ek ore takht par raja inder kaa asana laga diya jaataa tha, saath main pariyon ke liye kursiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 a scarlet curtain was hung behind the decorations
 isi ke peeche se paatro kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa tha
 King Inder, fairies etc
 characters once came and were present there
 ve apane samvaad bolkar waapas nahin jate the
 At that time, Natyarangan became so popular that many meetings were organized following the 'inder Sabha' of Amanat, such as 'madarilal's Inder Sabha', 'daryai Inder Sabha', 'hawaiian Inder Sabha' etc
 parsi naatak mandaliyon ne bhi in sabhaaon or majaliseparistaan ko apanaaya
 These compositions were not plays, nor did they form the theater of Hindi
 isi se bharatendu harishchandr inako 'naatakabhas' kehete the
 He wrote 'bandar Sabha' as his parody
 is prakaar bharatendu se purv hindi rangamanch or natya-rachana ke vyavsaayik tathaa avyavsaayik saahitiyik prayaas to hue par hindi kaa vaastavik or sthaayee rangamanch nirmit or viksit nahin ho paaya tha
 From 1850 AD to 1868 AD, the rise and spread of Hindi theater took place but its elegant development and permanent construction could not take place
 parsi naatak mandaliyon ke atirikt kuch or bhi chhutput vyavsaayik mandaliyaan vibhinn sthanon par nirmit huin par saahitiyik suruchi sampannataa kaa unamem bhi abhaav hi rahaa
 The framework of Hindi theater that was made in the efforts of professional circles, the work of publicity and dissemination, and whatever good playwrights Hindi got due to them - that opportunity and situation could not be taken advantage of
 bharatendu ke naatak likhane kii shuruyaat bangala ke vidyasundar naatak ke anuwaad se hoti he
 Although plays were written even before them, Bhartendu strengthened the foundation of Hindi drama by regularly writing several plays in Khadiboli
 bharatendu ke purvavarti naatakakaron main reva naresh vishwanath singh ke brijbhasha main likhe gaye naatak 'anand raghunandan' or gopalchandra ke 'nahush' ko anek vidwaan hindi kaa pratham naatak maanate hai
 It may be interesting to know here that Gopalchandra was the father of Bharatendu Harishchandra
 hindi ke vishuddh saahitiyik rangamanch or natya-srijan kii parampara kii drushti se san 1868 i
 kaa bada mahatva he
 The play-writing and staging of Bharatendu began this year
 iske purv na to paatro ke pravesh-gaman, drishy-yojana aadi se yukt koi vaastavik naatak hindi main rachaa gaya tha
 Bharatendu's father Gopalchandar Chit 'nahusha' and Maharaj Vishwanath Singh's 'aandarghunandan' were also not complete plays, nor were the theater developed with plans for curtains and scenes etc
; Most of the attempts of Natyarangan were also done in non-hindi speaking areas like Mumbai and the language was also a mixed slang form of hindi-urdu
 3 april san 1868 ko pan
 sheetalaprasad treepathi rachit 'janaki mangal' naatak kaa abhinay ‘banaras theatre’ main yojit kiya tha
 It is said that the boy who had to do the acting part of Laxman suddenly fell ill that day
 lakshmana ke abhinay kii samasya upasthit ho gai or us din yuvak bharatendu sthiti ko na sanbhaalate to natyyojan sthagit karnaa padataa
 In one-and-a-half hours, Bharatendu not only remembered his role of Laxman but also kept the entire 'janaki Mangal' drama in mind
 bharatendu ne apane abhijatya kii parvaah nahin kii
 In those days, people of high clans did not consider acting to suit their reputation
 is prakaar is naatak se bharatendu ne rangamanch par sakriy bhaag lenaa armbh kiya
 At the same time - he also started theatrical creation
 bharatendu ne san 1868 i
 se san 1885 i
 tak apane swalp or atyant vyast jivan se shesh 17 varshon main anek naatakon kaa srijan kiya, anek naatakon main swayan abhinay kiya, anek rangashalas nirmit karain or hindi rangamanch ke sthaapan kaa stuty prayaas kiya
 Not only this, many writers and Rangkarmis of Bharatendu inspired them for theatrical creation and acting
 bharatendu ke sadudyog evam prerana se kaashi, prayag, kanpur aadi kai sthanon par hindi kaa avyavsaayik saahitiyik rangamanch sthapit hua
 During the lifetime of Bharatendu, some of these colored institutions had been established: inke atirikt baliya, dumraanv, lakhanu aadi uttar pradesh ke kai sthanon or bihar pradesh main bhi hindi rangamanch or natya-srijan kii drudh parampara kaa nirmaan hua
 This question is of considerable importance from where Bhartendu and his fellow writers got the inspiration for theatrical creation
 is prashn kaa mahatva is drushti se or bhi bad jaataa he, jab ham dekhte hai ki hindi main natya-rachana kaa sutarapaat bharatendu kii hi nav-pravartankaree pratibha se hua
 Although there were some creation efforts in the Natya-style prior to Bharatendu, the actual form of the play first emerged from the authorship of Bharatendu
 astu, jab hindi main is saahitiyi-vidha kaa abhaav tha, to bharatendu ne natya-srijan kii prerana kahan se lee ? Looking for literary inspiration, it can be said that Bhartendu drew inspiration from Sanskrit and Prakrit's predecessor Indian theater-tradition and the English influence-stream with the contemporary theater of Bengali
 yadhyapi hamaare yahan bhaas, kalidaas, bhawabhooti, shudrak aadi purvavarti sanskrit naatakakaron kii samrudh natya-parampara vidyaman thi, par yah khed kii baat he ki bharatendu babu ne us samrudh sanskrit natya-parampara ko apane sammukh rakhaa
 In the prakrit-apabhramsa period, ie after the 9th-10th century AD, the Sanskrit drama became depressed
 praakrit or apbhransh main bhi natya-srijan vaisaa utkrisht nahin hua jaisaa purvavarti sanskrit-natya-sahitya tha
 Therefore, this predecessor of sanskrit-prakrit was a declining tradition in front of Bharatendu
 sanskrit ke murari, rajasekhar, jayadev aadi kii kramash: ‘anargharaaghav’, ‘balramayana’, ‘prasanraghav’ aadi rachanaayen hi bharatendu tathaa unke sahyogi lekhakon kaa adarsh baniin
 There was neither the seriousness of the story - or the content, which was in the immortal works of Kalidasa etc
, nor the superiority of the style-craft like them
 yahi kaaran he ki bharatendu-purv hindi naatak sarvatha nishpraan rahaa or yadhyapi bharatendu ne usamen samayik, saamaajik or saanskrithik jivan kii jhalak paidaa kar navonmesh or kinchit sapranata kaa prayaas kiya, par unke prayatnon ke baavjood bharatendukalin hindi naatak kathy or shilp donon kii hi drushti se shishav kaal main hi padaa rahaa, vishesh utkarsh ko praapt nahin hua
 In this way, through the Satyaprayan of Bharatendu Harishchandra, there was a strong tradition of Hindi literary theater and drama writing
 par san 1885 i
 main bharatendu ke nidhan ke pashchaat vah utsaah kuch mand pad gaya
 In the last decade of the 19th century, there were some small efforts again
 kai naatak mandaliyon kii sthapana hui, jaise prayag kii ‘shriramlila naatak mandali’ tathaa ‘hindi natya samiti’, bharatendu ji ke bhatijon- shrikrishnachandra or shri brajchandra-dwaara kaashi main sthapit ‘shri bharatendu naatak mandali’ tathaa ‘kaashi nagari naatak mandali
 Due to the efforts of these drama circles, many plays were performed at that time 'maharana Pratap', 'satya Harishchandra', 'mahabharata', 'subhadrashana', 'bhishmapitamah', 'bilv Mangal', 'sansar Swapna', 'kaliyug' etc
 
 par ye prayaas bhi bahut din nahin chal sake
 In the absence of wealth and governmental and non-governmental encouragement, efforts to establish literary theater all fell asleep over time
 in chhutput prayaason ke antargat tatkaaleen saahitiyik naatakon kaa abhinay hua or hindi main kuch achche rangamanchanukool saahitiyik naatakon kii rachana hui
 This attempt was a good answer to the ill effects of Parsi drama companies, but this effort was very voluntary
 duusare, is saahitiyik rangandolan se bhi hindi kaa rangamanch vishesh viksit nahin hua, kyonki yah rangamanch parsi rangamanch se vishesh bhinn or viksit nahin tha- vahi pardon kii yojana, vaisaa hi drishy-vidhaan or sangi aadi kaa prabandh rahata tha
 a theater revolving around scientific means could not be developed in the 19th century
 dhwani-yantra aadi kii sthapana ke prayaas bhi hindi rangamanch ke vikaas kii disha main koi mahatvapurn yoga nahin de paae
 Yes, they got the benefit that the corrupt propaganda of Parsi drama companies got some shock and some theater Hindi dramas came to light
 20 veen shatabdi ke tisare dashak main cinema ke aagaman ne parsi rangamanch ko sarvatha samaapt kar diya
 But the unconventional theater survived in new forms here and there
 ab hindi kaa rangamanch keval skulon or collejon main hi he
 This theater went on to adopt units more than big plays
 iske do mukhya kaaran hai- ek to aaj kaa darshak kam-se-kam samay main apane manoranjan kii purti karnaa chahta he, duusare, aayojakon ke liye bhi bade naatak kaa pradarshan yahaan bahut kathinaayee utpann karata he vahaan ekanki kaa pradarshan saral he-rangamanch, drishy-vidhaan aadi ekanki main saral hote hai, paatr bhi bahut kam rahete hai
 Therefore, in all the schools, cultural events, etc
, only the units are displayed
 dow ram kumaar verma, upendranath ashk, seth govind das, jagadishchandra maathur aadi hamaare anek naatakakaron ne sundar abhinay-upyogi ekanki naatakon tathaa deergh naatakon kii rachana kii he
 Prasad ji had enriched Hindi drama literature by creating high quality literary dramas, but many dramas used to create some difficulty in theater
 phir bhi kuch kaat-chhant ke saath prasad ji ke praaia: sabhi naatakon kaa abhinay hindi ke avyavsaayik rangamanch par hua
 Under the influence of Western playwrights like George Bernard Shaw, Ibsen, the above-mentioned Prasad modern dramatists created some very beautiful stage plays
 in naatakakaron ke anek puure naatak bhi rangamanchon se pradarshit hue
 After independence, many government-non-governmental efforts have been made towards permanent construction of Hindi theater
 sarkaar kii ore se bhi kai gaiyr-sarkari sansthaaon ko rangamanch kii sthapana ke liye aarthik sahaayta mili he
 Along with men, women too have started participating in acting
 skulon-collejon main kuch achche naatakon kaa ab acha pradarshan hone laga he
 Some good permanent theaters associated with many socio-cultural institutions have been established, such as permanent theaters are established in places like Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Allahabad, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Shantiniketan etc
 under the aegis of Theater Center
 kendriya sarkaar bhi is ore paryaapt dhyaan de rahi he
 But Hindi seems to be beggar-like at these linguistic theaters
 kendriya sarkaar ne sangeet naatak academy kii sthapana kii he, jisamen achche naatakakaron or kalakaaron ko protsaahan diya jaataa he
 Some efforts have also been made in the last few days to build a commercial theater
 prasiddh kalakaar swargeey prithviraj kapur ne kuch varsh hue prithvi theatre kii sthapana kii thi
 He has produced many plays, such as 'darav', 'gaddar', 'pathan', 'artist', 'ahuti' etc
 dhan kii haani uthaakar bhi kuch varsh is company ne utsaahpurvak acha kaary kiya
 But even after so much effort, there has not been a permanent commercial theater of Hindi in Bombay, Delhi or elsewhere

 tatkaaleen raashtrapati fairuddin ali ahamed ne tatkaaleen bhartiya pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke kehane par bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 352 ke adheen apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kar di
 This was the most controversial and undemocratic period in the history of independent India
 apatkaal main chunaav sthagit ho gaye tathaa naagarik adhikaron ko samaapt karke manamaani kii gai
 Indira Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned and banned from the press
 pradhanmantri ke bete sanjay gandhi ke netritv main bade paimaane par purush nasbandi abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 Jayaprakash Narayan called it 'the darkest period of Indian history'
 1967 or 1971 ke bich, pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne sarkaar or bhartiya rashtriya congress party ke saath hi sansad main baari bahumat ko apane niyantran main kar liya tha
 Instead of the Union Cabinet, central government power was concentrated within the Prime Minister's Secretariat
 sachivalay ke nirvaachit sadasyon ko unhone ek khatra ke rup main dekha
 For this he relied on his principal secretary PN Haksar, who was in the inner circle of Indira's advisors
 iske alaava, parameshwar narayan haksar ne sattarudh party kii vichaardhaara "patibaddh naukarshahi" ke vichaar ko badhaava diya
 Indira Gandhi cleverly alienated her rivals, causing the Congress to split and in 1969 — two parts, the Congress and the Congress that were on Indira's side, were split
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti or congress saansadon ke ek bade bhaag ne pradhanmantri kaa saath diya
 Indira Gandhi's party was stronger than the old Congress and a strong institution with traditions of internal democracy
 duusari or congress ke sadasyon ko jaldi hi samaj main aa gaya ki unki pragati indira gandhi or unke parivaar ke liye apni vafadari dikhne par puri tarah nirbhar karti he or chatukaarita kaa dikhaawati pradarshit karnaa unki dincharya ban gaya
 In the coming years, Indira's influence grew so much that she could establish self-elected loyalists as chief ministers of states, rather than members elected by the Congress Legislature Party
 indira kii us sarkaar ke paas janata ke bich unki karishmai apil kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Another reason for this was the decisions taken by the government

 Subsequently, unlike Syndicate and other opponents, Indira was seen as an "image of the poor pro, in matters of religion, with economics and secularism and socialism standing for the development of the entire country
" " pradhanmantri ko vishesh rup se vanchit virgon-garib, daliton, mahilaon or alpsankhyakon dwaara bahut samarthan mila
 For her, she was his Indira Amma
 1971 ke aam chunaavon main, "garibi hataao" kaa indira kaa loklubhaavan naaraa logon ko itnaa pasand aayaa ki puraskaar swarup unhen ek vishaal bahumat se jeeta diya
 "with regard to such a huge margin of victory, historian Ramachandra Guha later wrote that" Congress stands as the real Congress
 It does not require any suffix to show merit
 " In December 1971, under his active war leadership, India gave East Pakistan independence from its arch-enemy Pakistan

 Opposition leaders, who routinely accused him of being a dictator and promoting a personality cult, also considered him Durga Saman
 1975 kii tapati garmi ke dauraan achaanak bhartiya raajnneeti main bhi bechaini dikhi
 All this happened with the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in which Indira Gandhi was found guilty of rigging the election and she was banned from holding any position for six years
 lekin indira gandhi ne is faisale ko maanane se inkaar karte hue sarvocch nyaayalay main apil karne kii ghoshnaa kii or 26 june ko apatkaal lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 In her message broadcast on AIR, Indira Gandhi said, "ever since i have taken some progressive steps for the benefit of the common man and the women of the country, there was a deep conspiracy against me
 " As soon as the Emergency came into force, political opponents were arrested under the Internal Security Act, including Jayaprakash Narayan, George Fernandes and Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 maamla 1971 main hue loksabhaa chunaav kaa tha, jisamen unhone apane mukhya pratidwandvi raaj narayan ko parajeet kiya tha
 But four years after the election results came, Raj Narayan challenged the election result in the High Court
 unki daleel thi ki indira gandhi ne chunaav main sarkari mashinari kaa durupyog kiya, tay seemaa se adhik kharch kiye or matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye galat tareekon kaa istemaal kiy
 The court upheld these allegations
 iske baavjood indira gandhi tus se mas nahin huin
 Even the Congress party issued a statement saying that Indira's leadership is indispensable for the party
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko pratibandhit kar diya gaya kyonki mana gaya ki yah sanghathan vipakshi netaaon kaa kareebi he tathaa iskaa bada sanghathanaatmak aadhaar sarkaar ke viruddh virodh pradarshan karne kii sambhaavna rakhata tha
 The police cracked down on this organization and thousands of its activists were imprisoned
 aresas ne pratibandh ko chunauti di or hajaaron swayamsevakon ne pratibandh ke khilaaf or moulik adhikaron ke hanan ke khilaaf satyagrah main bhaag liya
 The whole of India was in a state of shock after the leaders of all opposition parties and other outspoken critics of the government were arrested and sent behind bars
 apatkaal kii ghoshnaa ke kuch hi samay baad, sikh netritv ne amritsar main baithkon kaa aayojan kiya jahaan unhone "congress kii fasivadi pravriti" kaa virodh karne kaa sankalp kiya
 The first mass protest in the country was organized by the Akali Dal which is known as the "campaign for the Defense of Democracy"
 ise 9 july ko amritsar main shuru kiya gaya tha
 Nearly two years after the imposition of the Emergency, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recommended dissolution of the Lok Sabha and holding elections
 chunaav main apatkaal lagu karne kaa faisalaa congress ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 Indira Gandhi herself lost the election to her stronghold Rae Bareli
 janata party baari bahumat se satta main ai or morarji desai pradhanmantri bane
 The number of Congress members in Parliament was reduced from 350 to 153 and after 30 years a non-congress government was formed at the Center
 congress ko uttar pradesh, bihar, punjab, haryana or dilli main ek bhi seat nahin mili
 The Shah Commission was constituted by the new government to investigate the decisions taken during the Emergency
 haalaanki nai sarkaar do saal hi tik pai or andruni antarvirodhon ke kaaran 1979 main sarkaar gir gai

 Where the husband is alive, but if the child originates from an inappropriate relationship with his mother and another man, then it is considered as varnaskar or jarj
 keval unheen santanon kii, jo vaid vaivaahik sambandh se utpann hota he, vaidhanik sthiti hoti he or ve hi vaid samajhi jaati he
 Under the Anglo law, which has been accepted and adopted in India, the only valid proof of the validity of the child is only if it originated from the legitimate marriage of his mother and man, or within two hundred and eighty days after the separation of his mother and He was born to the father until it is proved that there has never been contact between the common party in his or her death
 prayek vaad main vaidhata ko pramanit karne ke nimitt vyaavhaarik kathinaayee se bachane ke liye kanoon ne nishkarsh nikaalane kaa ek saral upaay pradaan kiya he ki jab tak iske vipareet pramaan na diya jaae, vivaah ke kaal main utpann sabhi santaanen vaid maan lee jaayengi

 In this subject the Hindu method follows the Anglo method
 kintu musalmaan vidhi ke antargat vaidhata bhinn ritiyon se nishchit hoti he
 The Law of Islam provides that the child born within six months of the marriage period is illegal unless the father accepts it as his child or that the child born after six months is valid provided that the father does not reject it or the ten lunar months after the marriage
 The offspring produced within the Sunni law is valid and within two lunar years under the Shia law and four years under the Shafi and Maliki method
 Under the safe and Shafi and Maliki method is legitimate children within four years
 is vishay or avadhi ke vistaar tathaa bhinnata ke do kaaran die jate hai
 One is that the early Islamic jurists had incomplete knowledge of the conception or period of conception, and the second was the urge for human feelings to defend the inability and prestige of the woman and the children born to her
 musalmaan vidhi, jahaan aagrah
 Muslim law accepts the right of paternity where there is no information or doubtfulness is present

 In all systems, the legitimate child is the heir to his father's property and is also responsible for his debt

 In India, irrespective of the individual laws, the Indian Penal Code empowers magistrates in India to allow a person to give monthly expenses to their offspring as they deem fit, whether legal or illegal
 vidhi kaa mantavya santanon ko avaanchhneeya maarg se jeevika uparjan karne se rokna he, jahaan pita sangrakshan main udasin he yaa bharanposhan kaa vyay dena asweekaar karata he
 If a person does not fulfill that order without sufficient cause when the order is made, the magistrate may issue a warrant for the violation of each such order and also punish him with imprisonment which shall not exceed one month or If the repayment of subsistence is made before it, then it can be punishable till it is paid

 When a bird hits a tree branch or beak on the ground, we immediately understand that it is eating some food or insect etc

 mukh kii mudra, deh kii angabhang tathaa camendriyon ke hilne chalane ke vyavhaar se agochar maansik kriyaayein vichaar, ragadwesh aadi bhi duusare logon par vyakt hote hai
 The simplest form of physical behavior is found in "spontaneous action"
 yadi aankh par prakashpunj phenki jaae, to putali tatkaal sikudne lagati he
 It is an innate, natural spontaneous action
 is kriya kaa na to koi purvagami athwa sahachaari chetan anubhav hota he or na hi yah vyakti kii ichha ke bas main rahati he
 Similarly, with the touch of chilli, the eyes become tearful

 "abhyaanukoolit" kriyaaon kaa bhi koi purvagami yaa sahachaari chetana anubhav nahin hota or aacharan bhi vyakti kii ichha ke adheen nahin hota
 In this, there is an indication of the neglect of conscious desire, and the freedom of subtle bodily veins coincidence
 saamaajik adarsh va aacharan ke satat prabhaav se jahaan ek vyakti maansaahaar parose jane ke samachar se khinn hota he, vahiin doosraa prasann hota he

 An Anglo Scientist Pvt

, the adult's anger uses exceptions, social exclusion, economic loss and amazing physical chemical weapons
 kintu krodh kaa anubhav to sab paristhitiyon main ek samaan rahata he
 Pvt macdougal has also made a list of basic trends with the criterion of the development of the animal class, and the definitive form of emotions

 His list is very popular and his fame is often found in many modern sociology

 Modern psychologists have started to consider the subtle behavior of the body as the basic nature, for the simplest understanding of the situation, avoiding the confusion of mental motive
 unhen daihik tantuon ke mul gun prakruti maryaadit tanaav main hi mul pravriti kaa vishwaas hota he
 When stress is increased in different fibers of the body due to a specific condition, then a basic instinct to reduce that tension becomes aware and by its inspiration, the organism starts a variety of activities
 jab uchit kaary dwaara us daihik tantu tanaav main yathesht dhilaav ho jaataa he, tab tatsambandhit mul vritti tathaa usase utpann prerana bhi shant ho jaati he
 Another feature of somatic fibers is that there is a tendency to rest when tired of doing special actions
 prayek daihik tathaa manodaihik kriya main newnaadhik thakaan tathaa vishram kaa dharm dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, it is considered as a subtle stunted instinct with sleep, fear, sexual intercourse etc
 arthath aadhunik mat keval do prakaar kii mul pravriti maanane kaa he- Tendency to reduce somatic fiber stress; daihik tantuon ke thak jane par uchit vishram kii pravriti
 The only way to understand the behavior of the fauna is to gain knowledge of their various motivations
 prerana or pravriti ke sambandh se kuch vidvan mul pravriti se hi mul prerana kii utpatti maanate hai
 But in civilized life, artificial and learned attitudes also have their rightful place
 is yug main dhanoparjan kaa kaary sabko hi karnaa padataa he
 The desire for wealth is only for the sake of its favors
 vaastavik prerana to abhisht vastuon kii prapti, tathaa unke sambhog kii manovriti se hoti he
 Therefore, the motivation to earn money is an earned means, the inspiration learned in modern civilization
 dhan ke adwitiya vinimay gun ke kaaran hi dhan paane kii ichha utpann hoti he
 But this inspiration is as much wrapped up in making ordinary money as it is by the motivations of dieting
 yadi kisi bachche main cycle sawari kii prerana he, to vah kabhi ghudsawaari se shant nahin hoti
 Both are artificial inspirations, but to call them ruthless is false
 ukt bachche ke liye cycle vaisaa hi sabal vyavharprerak he, jaisaa swaadisht bhojan
 We can easily divide motivation into two classes - yadi pehle varg kii prerana ko anukool vaa dhanatmak kahen, to duusare varg kii prerana ko pratikul vaa rinatmak kah sakate hai
 In one, the person is moved by the greed of the motivator and in the second, the person withdraws from fear of the motivator presented, or turns away from it, or takes other measures of defense
 yadi pehali main pravriti he to duusari main nivritti
 The normal situation is neither pure happiness nor complete sadness
 vah praaia: mishrit hoti he; yadi kuch anshon main vah sukhad hoti he to saath hi duusare anshon main vah du:khad bhi hoti he
 Where one element pulls us, the other element pushes us
 jab ham chaakar vritti grahan kar jeevika chalaate hai, to ham paradheenata main bhi fas jate hai
 Many situations present a duality of ragdwesh in the most fierce form
 jab isht kii maatra adhik lagati he, tab ham jhat usee ore pravrutt hote hai
 And where the amount of waste is high, we immediately move away
 kintu jab ragadwesh kii ubhay preranaayen samaan maatra main dikhaai detii hai, tab manushya ko chintaa hoti he or sanshayvash use vichaar tathaa paraamarsh kaa aashray lenaa padataa he
 Sometimes two beautiful inspirations pull a human being together but in opposing directions
 yah bhi kam chintajanak dwandv nahin he
 When the child encounters a problem whether he takes a toy or a sweet, the poor person gets trapped in a dilemma
 kabhi-kabhi ham donon ore se vipattiyon ke bich fas jate hai; ek ore kuan he, to duusari ore khai
 If you tell the truth, you will get punishment and if you lie, there is self-aggression
 siddhantaroop se preranaon kaa dwandv praaia: in teenon prakaar kaa hota he
 But in the normal situation, many positive and negative parts are lumped together
 prerak paristhiti main kabhi prakrut ansh mukhya or kabhi gaun bhi hote hai
 Motivational items and situations are most often measured by social and economic superiority
 yadi koi baccha khilone kii apeksha pustak ko lenaa pasand karata he, to uske moolyankan main saamaajik shiksha tathaa vaigyanik abhyaas or anubhuti kaa hi vishesh prabhaav rahata he
 Similarly, with every part of the situation, there is at most a clear fraction of the degree of definite social superiority
 at: bahumukhi paristhiti main prakrut ansh kii apeksha saamaajik pasand kaa hi sfoot mahatv rahata he
 We refuse to go with the procession because there is no new cloth
 kabhi samajapratishtha ke moh se ham udhaar lekar adhik dahej aadi daan karte hai
 On being nurtured by inspiration, a human cannot remain completely passive and a new law is formed by reacting something

 The problem of entry into household life is often confusing for every young man and woman
 kintu nirnay hote hi, tadnukool kriyaayein dhararoop se doorvarti dhyey kii ore pravaahit hoti hai
 Similarly, in the problem of every conflicting conflicting desires, we accept one and leave the other
 parantu maanya ishtaprapti ke prayaas main tyakt icchaayen bhi kabhi avasar paakar sir uthaati hai, pashchaattap badhaati hai or vishesh avasthaa main vyakti kii buddhi harne main safal hokar use newnaadhik pathbhrasht bhi kar detii hai
 Adjustment with the situation is the natural nature of the person
 vah kabhi anukool or kabhi pratikul manovriti se pratikriya karnaa he
