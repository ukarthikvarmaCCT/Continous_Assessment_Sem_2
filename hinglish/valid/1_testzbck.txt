 Accounting has been called the 'language of business'
 hindi main 'accountancy' ke samatuly 'lekhavidhi' tathaa 'lekhakarm' shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Accounting is the branch of mathematical science that is useful in finding the reasons for success and failure in business
 lekhashastra ke siddhant vyavasayik ikaayiyon par vyaavhaarik kala ke teen prabhaagon main lagu hote hai, jinke naam hai, lekhankan, bahi-khaataa, tathaa lekha pariksha 
 In the modern era, the form of economic activities of man has become very wide and versatile
 anek prakaar ke vyapaar va udyog-dhandhon tathaa vyavsaayon kaa janm ho rahaa he
 The purpose of industries and other business activities is to achieve profitability
 vyapaaree yaa udyogpati ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki use vyapaar kii safalataa va asafalataa yaa laabh-haani va aarthik sthiti kaa gyaan hona chahie
 For this, he makes extensive use of manuals and accounting methods
 lekhankan-pustaken banaakar vyapaarik sansthaaon ko apni aarthik sthiti va laabh-haani kii jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Although bookkeeping and accounting are not compulsory for a businessman, but without this they cannot carry out their work successfully and they are not even aware of the profit or loss from their business activities
 lekhe rakhane kii kriya kisi na kisi rup main us samay se vidyaman he jab se vyavsaay kaa janm hua he
 a very small businessman can keep accounts in the brain by recourse to memorisation, another can provide written form on paper
 vyavasthit rup se lekha rakhaa jaye yaa avyavasthit rup se, yah lekhankan hi kahalaayegaa
 As the size of the business grew and the nature of the business became increasingly complex accounting began to take shape
 isamen tark vitark, kaaran prabhaav vishleshan ke aadhaar par pratipaadit thos niyamon evam siddhanton kii neenv padati gai evam saamaanya lekha-jokha ek kaalaantar main vrahat lekhashastra ke rup main hamaare saamne aayaa
 The size of modern business has grown so much that hundreds, thousands and thousands of business transactions take place in it
 in len denon ke byore ko yaad rakhkar vyavsaayik upkram kaa sanchaalan karnaa asambhav he
 Therefore, systematic records of these transactions are kept and their systematic knowledge and experimentation is called accounting
 lekhashastra ke vyaavhaarik rup ko lekhankan kah sakate hai
 According to the Bulletin, the accounting terminology of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, "accounting for behaviors and events that are at least partly financial in nature, effectively writing, classifying and summarizing money as a currency and the consequences thereof
" Is the art of explaining
 ’’ According to this definition accounting is an art, not a science
 is kala kaa upyog vittiya prakruti ke mudra main maapneey vyavhaaron or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan, vargeekaran, sankshepan or nirvachan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Smith and Ashburn have presented the above definition with some improvement
 unke anusaar ‘lekhankan mukhyatah vittiya prakruti ke vyavsaayik lendenon or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan tathaa vargeekaran kaa vigyaan he or un lendeene or ghatnaon kaa mahatvapurn saransh banane, vishleshan tathaa vyakhya karne or parinaamon ko un vyaktiyon ko sampreshit karne kii kala he, jinhen nirnay lene hai
 According to this definition, accounting is both science and art
 kintu yah ek purna nishchit vigyaan na hokar lagbhag purna vigyaan he
 The American Accounting Principles Board has defined accounting as a service action
 uske anusaar, ‘lekhankan ek seva kriya he
 Its function is to give consequential information of financial nature mainly about financial units which is useful in making economic decisions by rational selection in alternative behavioral actions
 ’ Based on the above considerations, accounting can be called the art of writing, presenting, interpreting and informing the transactions of the financial nature of the business in a definite, structured and well planned manner
 sarvapratham praarambhik lekhankan ke record pracheen babylon, asyria or sumeria ke khandhar main paae gaye, jo 7000 varshon se bhi pehle kii taarikh ke hai
 The people of the time relied on ancient accounting methods to record the growth of crops and cattle
 kyonki krishi or pashu paalan ke liye prakritik ritu hoti he, atah agar fasalon kii paidaavaar ho chuki ho yaa pashuon ne nae bachche paidaa kiye hon to hisaab-kitaab kar adhishesh ko nirdhaarit karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Based on the above definitions of accounting, the following characteristics are clear - lekhankan ek kala or vigyaan donon he
 In the form of art, it helps to know the financial result
 isamen abhilikhit tathaa vargeekrut len-denon or ghatnaon kaa saransh taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 They are analyzed and interpreted
 vittiya samankon kaa vishleshan evam nirvachan lekhankan kii kala hi he jiske liye vishesh gyaan, anubhav or yogyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Similarly, conveying the meaning of financial data to the internal and external aspects of a business and its changes in such a way that they can take wise decisions in relation to business, is the art of accounting
 vigyaan ke rup main yah ek vyavasthit gyaan shakha he
 It has definite rules for recording, categorizing and summarizing transactions and events
 in nishchit niyamon ke kaaran hi lekhon kaa krambaddh va vyavasthit rup se abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 But it is not a 'completely definite' science, but an 'almost perfect science'
 lekhankan main mudra main maapan yogya vittiya prakruti kii ghatnaon or vyavhaaron kaa hi lekha kiya jaataa he
 Practices that are not financial in nature are not accounted for in books
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek sanstha ke paas samarpit va vishwasaneey karmchaariyon kii ek toli ho jo vyavsaay ke liye bahut upyogi he, kaa lekha vyavsaay kii pustakon main nahin kiya jaayegaa kyonki yah vittiya prakruti kii nahin he tathaa ise mudra main abhivyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Accounting is a service function according to the board's definition of accounting principles
 iskaa uddeshy vyavsaayik kriyaaon ke bare main parimanatmak vittiya suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 The final product of accounting, ie the financial statement, is useful to those who make decisions about alternative functions
 lekhankan swayan kisi dhan kaa srijan nahin karata he, yadhyapi yah iske upyogkartaaon ko upyogi soochna uplabdh karaata he jo inhen dhan ke srijan evam rakh rakhaav main sahaayak hota he
 The main objectives of accounting are as follows - prayek vyavsaayik len-dein ko pustakon main krambaddh tareeke se likhnaa va uchit hisaab rakhana lekhankan kaa pratham uddeshy he
 In the absence of accounting, there would be a lot of burden on human memory which in most cases would have been impossible to bear
 vidhivat abhilekhan se bhul va chal-kapaton ko dur karne main sahaayta milti he
 Accounting protects against improper and undesirable use of business assets
 aisa lekhankan dwaara prabandh ko nimna suchanaaen pradaan karne ke kaaran sambhav hota he - The above information helps the business owner to know that the funds of the business are not unnecessarily idle
 lekhankan avadhi ke ant main vyavsaay sanchaalan ke falswaroop utpann shuddh laabh athwa haani kaa nirdhaaran lekhankan kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 There is a difference between net profit or loss and some proceeds of certain duration and some expenses
 yadi aagmon kii raashi adhik he to shuddh laabh hoga tathaa vipareet paristhiti main shuddh haani
 It is an indicator of managerial skills and business progress
 yahi anshadhariyon main labhaansh vitaran kaa aadhaar hota he
 The information provided by the profit and loss account is not sufficient
 vyavsaayee apni vittiya sthiti bhi jaananaa chahta he
 This is accomplished by letter
 chittha ek vishesh tithi ko vyavsaay kii sampattiyon evam dayitvon kaa vivaran he
 It acts as a barometer in knowing the financial health of the business
 vivekpurna nirnay lene ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon evam sanstha main hit rakhane vaale vibhinn pakshakaron ko vaanchit soochna uplabdh karana, lekhankan kaa uddeshy he
 The American Accounting Association has also given special emphasis to this point while defining accounting
 unke anusaar, The first task of accounting is to systematically and methodically accounting all business deals and events in the journal
 yahaan yah dhyaan rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki lekhankan main unheen saudon evam ghatnaon kaa lekha kiya jaataa hai jo vittiya swabhaav kii hai tathaa jinhen mudra ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 After accounting for monetary transactions, they are classified according to their nature into separate groups on the basis of equality so that separate information can be available for different items separately
 udhaahrantaya samast bikri ke saudo ko, jo bhinn bhinn sthanon par likhe gayi hai, ek hi sthaan par ekatrit karnaa, taaki kul bikri kii raashi gyaat ho sake
 This is done by opening accounts in the ledger
 lekhankan kaa mukhya uddeshy nirnay lene waalon ke liye mahatvapurn soochna pradaan karnaa he
 For this work, at the end of the year, after finding the balances of all the accounts, a list is made from them and two details - profit and loss account and letter are prepared from that list
 in vivaranon se vyavsaay kii laabhadaayakta, vittiya sthiti, bhugtan kshamta aadi ke sambandh main mahatvapurn suchanaaen uplabdh ho jaati he
 In this way all the information of the year is summarized and merges into two details which shows the final results of the business
 lekhankan na keval lekha karne, vargeekaran karne evam sankshipteekaran karne kaa hi kaary karti he balki un aankadon kaa nirvachan karke nishkarsh evam upyogi suchnaaain bhi pradaan karti he
 For example, what was the rate of repatriation in the organization? How much did advertising impact sales growth? Information such as the status of liquidity and payment capacity are available
 lekhon ke vishleshan evam nirvachan se praapt soochnaaon kaa unke prayogkartaaon jaise viniojakon, lendaaron, sarkaar, swaamiyon aadi tathaa vyavsaay main hit rakhane vaale anya vyaktiyon ko sanvahan kiya jaataa he taaki ve vyavsaay kii vittiya sthiti ke sambandh main apni raay bana saken tathaa bhavi yojana ke sambandh main nirnay le sake
 The last task of accounting is to make such arrangements so that various statutory requirements can be met
 anek aise kanoon hai jinaki purti karnaa ek vyavsaayee ke dwaara anivaary he jaise iskar kii ritern prastut karnaa, bikrikar kii ritern prastut karnaa, sebi ke dwaara banaaye gayi niyamon kii paalna karnaa aadi
 Accounting helps in this task
 aadhunik vyapaarik kriyaaon ke safal sanchaalan ke liye lekhankan ko ek aavashyaktaa samajha jaataa he
 Why accounting is necessary can be explained by the following arguments - lekhankan kii anek pranaliyaan hai jinamein se nimnlikhit ullekhneey hai- 1

 Double Accounting System 4

 All cash transactions are written in this book
 varsh ke ant main koi antim khaataa yaa laabh-haani khaataa aadi nahin banaaya jaataa
 An income-expenditure account is created to understand the state of income-expenditure
 is paddati main nakad len-denon ko rocked pustak main tathaa udhaar len denon ko khaataa bahi main likhaa jaataa he
 This system is mainly used by small retail traders
 is prakaar pustaken rakhane se keval yah jaankaree hoti he ki vyapaaree kii rokad kii sthiti kisi he, arthath kitni rokad aayi tathaa kitni gayi tathaa kitni shesh he
 How much to give to whom and from whom to take, the information becomes from the ledger
 is paddati se laabh-haani khaataa va aarthik chittha bananaa sambhav nahin hota jab tak ki is pranali ko doharaa lekha pranali main badal na diya jaay
 Hence this system is considered as incomplete system
 yah pustapaalan kii sabase acchhee pranali maani jaati he
 In this method both forms of each behavior are accounted for
 yah kuch nishchit siddhanton par aadhaarit hoti he
 At the end of the year, it is easy to know the actual status of the business by creating final accounts through this method
 yah bharat main atyant prachinkaal se prachlit paddati he
 Most Indian businessmen keep their accounts according to this system
 yah bhi nishchit siddhanton par aadhaarit purnataya vaigyanik pranali he
 On the basis of this system, a profit-loss account and an economic letter are made at the end of the year
 vittiya lekhankan kaa mukhya uddeshy vittiya soochnaaon ko pahchaanana, maapna, likhnaa, sanvahan karnaa or saath hi vyapaarik saudon ko lekha pustakon main is prakaar se darj karnaa jisase ki ek nishchit avadhi ke liye vyavsaay ke sanchaalanaatmak parinaam gyaat kiye ja saken tathaa ek nishchit tithi ko aarthik sthiti kaa pataa lagaana he
 Cost accounting is a process of accounting of costs that begins with the recording of income and expenditure, or the basis on which they are calculated, and ends with the preparation of statistical data
 is lekha vidhi main vartmaan laagat ke saath saath bhavi vyayon par bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he

 natya parampara kii charchaa karne se purv yah baat spasht samaj leni chahie ki is parampara ke prarambh se hi do rup prachlit rahe hai
 Of these, one is called Natyadharmi and the other is called Lokdharmi tradition
 "naatyashasre' ke praneta bharatmuni ne in shabdon par prakaash daalate hue spasht kiya tha ki jin naatakon kii rachana shasreey niyamon ke anusaar kii jaati he, ve naatak "natyadharmee' kehalaate hai or jinaki rachana swatantra rup se lokparampara ke anusaar kii jaati he, ve naatak "lokdharmee' kehalaate hai
 Be it dramatics or folkloric, they have a fantasy environment
 sahityavaadiyon ne naatak ke shilp main vastu, netaa or ras ko mahatv diya he, kalavaadiyon ne ras, bhav, abhinay, nritt, nrity tathaa prastutikaran ke anya upangon ko
 The long tradition of drama in India has been so extensive and powerful that even before the 10th century, folklore drama-tradition had absorbed many governing elements
 15 sau varsh kii natyaparampara ne yahan ke janajivan main naatak kii vishaal kalatmak chetana kaa sundar samanvay kar use bhavy or jeevant swarup pradaan kiya
 The drama tradition of Brajbhasha also could not remain untouched by it
 is parampara ke itihaas par drushti nikshep karne se gyaat hota he ki brajabhasha kii parampara natyadharmee rupon main samaan gati se pravaahit hoti rahi he
 It is difficult to say when and where did the Brajbhasha plays begin? The facts that emerge based on the available material are very interesting and surprising
 brajabhasha ke pratham natya- rupon kaa parichay assam ke "ankianaton' main miltaa he
 It is well known that in the 15th century, a rapid wave of vaishnava-bhakti movement arose in Assam and Bengal
 vahaan ke bhakton ne apane isht bhagwaan krishna or radha kii manoram lilaon kaa gunanuwaad geet, sangeet, nrity, kavy, prabandh or naatakon ke madhyam se kiya
 The songs in the plays were composed in Braj Bhasha and the format of the plays there was originally lyric-oriented
 brajabhasha ke maadhurya or mardav ne logon ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki mithila- kshetra ke naatakon main bhi brajabhasha kaa prayog hone laga
 This tradition remains intact there till today
 darbhanga tathaa uske sameepvarti tirhut mandal main aaj bhi kai gaanv mandali waalon ke hai, jo ghumantu natya- dalon ke rup main desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main bhraman karte hai or jinke naatakon kaa kavyanubandh brajabhasha main hota he
 These people do not call it Braj Bhasha and call it "bhasha"
 maithil natya- sahitya main anek naatak aise hai, jinhen aaj bhi "bhashaa- naatak' kaha jaataa he
 It is different that the form of his Brajbhasha is not as refined as it is today
 uttar bharat main brajabhasha- naatak kaa pratham aalekh pranachandra virachit "hanumannatak' miltaa he
 The play was composed at a time when the people of Khadi Boli did not even know the name
 "hanumannatak' ke pashchaat brajabhasha kii natya- parampara main samaysar naamak naatak kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 In Samvat 1643, King Jaswant Singh composed a play called Prabodh Chandrodaya
 yah naatak atyant lokapriy siddh hua
 It was adapted in many languages in a short time
 samvath 1645 main jain kavi mall dwaara iskaa rupantar bahut lokapriy hua
 In Samvat 1655, a play called Karuna Bharan was composed by Lakkhiram
 aisa lagata he ki yah naatak bhi atyant lokapriy hua
 Many copies of this are seen in many places
 pashchaat sanwat 1686 main bharatpur ke ek kavi ne "madhav- vinod' naamak naatak kii rachana kii
 By this time, the influence of Brajbhasha had increased so much that the writers of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab and Vindhya Pradesh also started accepting Brajbhasha as the medium of literature creation
 bengali tathaa sanskrit bhashaa ke marmajna srirup goswami bhi is bhashaa par itane rize ki unhone ek granth sanskrit main likhaa
 Later, a friend asked his poet to translate it into Braj Bhasha
 unke mitra ne srirup goswami dwaara virachit granth kii chaaya par brajabhasha main govind vilaas naamak naatak kii rachana kii
 Shortly after this, Maharaja Vishwanath Singh composed a play called "anandarghunandan"
 is naatak ke mangalacharan main braj tathaa angl- bhashaa ke shabdon kaa mishran hai, kintu puraa gadhy brajabhasha kaa he
 Guru Govind Singh's play is strong evidence of Brajbhasha
 samvath 1857 main kaashi ke prasiddh rais shri gopalchandraji ne nahush naamak naatak kii rachana kii
 Bharatendu Harishchandra, the son of Sri Gopalachandraji, composed a play called Sri Chandravali in Brajbhasha
 bhaaratendu kaal ke anek lekhakon ne brajabhasha ke sundar naatak rache
 Dramas such as Shri Radhacharan Goswami, Shri Kishori Lal Goswami's Tan Man Dhan Gusainiji's play and Gopal Sakha are reflective of this tradition
 yahan tak ki jaishankar prasad ne bhi prarambh main apane naatakon main brajabhasha kaa prayog kiya
 The creations of Brajbhasha from the Delhi and Mathura centers of All India Radio revived life in the era of Khadi Boli
 akashwani ke dilli tathaa mathura centre se brajabhasha ke naatakon kaa niyamit prasaaran prarambh hua
 As a result, many writers were active, who composed thousands of Brajbhasha-plays in a short period
 is abhinav- chetana se brajabhasha ke naatakon kii vishay- vastu kaa vistaar hua
 Earlier, the use of Brajbhasha was mostly confined to poetry
 akashwani kii maang ne nae vishyon par likhane kaa sutarapaat kiya
 In a short time, the new environment of the era began to become vocal in Brajbhasha plays
 vishay- vastu kaa kshetra nae kshitijon tak vistarit hua or lekhakon ne veda se lekar vigyaan tak, samast ayaamon kaa apane naatakon main chithran kiya
 Among the new playwrights in Brajbhasha are Gopalprasad Vyas, Dr
 Sharanbihari Goswami, Kaka Hathrasi, Dr
 Brajavallabh Mishra, Mohanswaroop Bhatia, Gopalprasad Mudgal, Dr
 Vasant Yamadagni, Satyanarayana Yagnavalka, Ramnaresh Pandey, Ms
 Hemlata Mishraan, Shyamasuran "shyamsunder" , Kailashchandra "krishna", Bhagwanadatta Chaturvedi, Sharmanlal Agarwal, Balmukund Chaturvedi, Triloknath "brajwal" and Dr
 The names of Vishnu Chaturvedi are notable
 brajabhasha- naatakon kii duusari parampara vah he, jo pichley 500 varsh se abaadh gati se lok main prachlit he, kintu unke naatak pustak rup main prakashit na hokar maatr parampara par ashrith hai
 It can be called Lokadharmi Natya-tradition or traditional Brajbhasha Natya
 iske kathanak pustak kii apeksha pradarshan ke rup main hi akshunn bane hue hai
 Although the forms of Raslila, Nautanki, Bhagat, Swang, Ramlila and Khel etc
 are popular in the Braj region, in terms of craft and form, the most ancient and artistic form is seen in "raslila" itself
 raasalila kaa prarambh 16 veen shatabdi se mana jaataa he
 So far, the authors have mentioned the names of Goswami Vallabhacharya, Sri Ghamandevji and Sri Narayanaswamy, the originators of the passage, with its origin
 lekhak is tathy ko bhul gaye ki raasalila kaa nrity- paksh kisi purvavarti shasreey nrity kii style se aabaddh he or uski shiksha ghamandadev ji ne chaturvedi baalkon ko di, to swayan bhi kisi purvavarti nrityaacharya se apane shishav- kaal main vah shiksha avashya grahan kii hogi
 The dance of Raas is purely a reflection of the archaic tradition of Indian national dance
 jahaan tak aalekh kaa prashn he, ho saktaa he, 16 veen shatabdi main in aacharyon ne uski abhinavikaran kiya ho, uski vishay- vastu ko sanskrit evam praakrit se hataakar ashtachhaapi kavy kii padaavalee se susambaddha kiya ho, kintu raasalila ke abhinay main prayukt naandi, nritt, nrity, hastkon kaa prayog, sthand, chaariyaan, gatiyaan tathaa vaachik- style aadi vishuddhtah iskaa sambandh bharat kii pracheen naatyashasreey parampara kii ore ingit karti he
 Raslila's artistic ambience is fully reflected in the Natyasriya tradition
 isamen mul- kathanak "purv- rag' ke pashchaat prastut kiya jaataa he
 Among the handicrafts, "shikhar, Dol, Kapihath, Pankha, Utsang and Mrigashirsha" are used according to the national rules
 pradarshan ke madhya "vishkanbhak', "garbhaank' tathaa "tripati' kaa prayog hota he
 Acting according to context - various "placements" are determined in the venue
 atodya main "ghan, avanaddh, sushir tathaa tat' vaadyon kaa prayog "ashravan' tathaa "oopohan' naamak shasreey kriyaaon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In acting, Aangik, Vachik, Satvik and Dietary are used as per rules
 is style main sabase adhik mahatvapurn baat he -- "shasr or vidhi' kaa niyamanusaar nibandhan, paramparit natya- rupon main nautanki tathaa swang aadi main shasranusaar "vidhi paksh' kaa nirvaah nahin kiya jaataa, keval "shasr- paksh' ke kuch angon kaa prayog dekhne ko miltaa he
 That experiment also seems to have been adapted from Raslila's performances, not enlightened by scripture, because the form of governing dignity has been distorted in them
 "raasalila' main shasreey maryaada apane yavat rup main parilakshith hoti he
 There is no doubt that the tradition of "farce" is more ancient than Nautanki and Bhagat
 "swang' kii charchaa jaaysi tathaa kabir ke sahitya main hui he, nautanki or bhagat naamak shabd 19 veen shatee se purv ke sahitya main dekhne ko nahin milte
 This is clear from the stage - craft and presentation abhas ho jaataa he ki ye natya- rup bhi sanskrit natya- parampara main nirdisht kuchhek lakshanon kaa vikrut rup hai
 Swang's "ranga 'refers to the" Granthika "mentioned in Patanjali's" Mahabhashya "
 tatkaaleen natya- prayogon kaa "granthik katha ke sutron ko apane varnan dwaara jodne kaa kaary kiya karata tha, paatro or ghatnaon se darshakon ko parichit karaata tha
 It is likely that some special class of individuals created genres called Nautanki and Bhagat on the shadow of "swang" with the aim of creating their own independent theatrical performances
 jahaan tak manchan kaa prashn he, in vividh shaileyon main bhed nahin he
 The method of presentation of all is the same, the craft and the form are the same
 sarvapratham "mangalacharan' hota he, pashchaat "ranga' arthath "sutaradhar' cathodghaat karata he
 Instrumentalists sit on the open stage on one side, characters enter the stage on the other side
 kathanak choubola, laavani, bahretbil, savaiya, doha, rola tathaa kavitt aadi naamak chhandon main swar or taal ke saath prastut kiya jaataa he
 Due to the influence of the era, the plot varies
 "raasalila' kaa katha- tatv shrimad bhagwat se prasut he, usamen bhakthi kii pradhanta yathaavat bani hui he, jabaki "bhagat' or "nautanki' ke katha- tatv main bahya- prabhaavon ke kaaran anek parivartan hote rahe hai
 Most of the gimmick of Nautanki became adornment, their appearance changed like the Supremacists of Sufi tradition
 manchi prasadhano ke liye sabhi natya- rupon main sankethik vastu- nirdesh tathaa pratikatmak mudraon kaa prayog hota he
 The presentation of these theatrical forms is performed on a platform-altar under the open sky
 manch- vedi ke teen ore, kabhi- kabhi chaaron ore darshak- gana baith jate hai
 "singar-ghar" is made in a closed place near the altar
 paatr yahan sajte hai or bhoomika ke samay yathanusaar darshakon ke madhya chode hue patale raste se manch par pravesh or prasthaan karte hai
 Their makeup method is based purely on Indian minerals and flora
 "raasalila' tathaa nautanki or bhagat ke manch main doosraa antar yah he ki "raasalila' main bhoomika karne vaale balak tathaa mandali ke sadsy bhakthi bhaavana se ot- prot rahete hai, unka naitik aacharan vishesh dharmik sampradaay kaa anuyaayi hota he
 Characterization of characters in gimmick maryaada kaa vichaar nahin kiya jaataa
 Any character can play the role in it
 inke saath sree- paatro main veshyaayein bhi bhoomika kar sakati hai
 There is a huge difference in the moral aspect of the artists of both the forums
 iskaa mul kaaran donon kaa uddeshy he
 The aim of Raslila is based on the spread of religion, nautanki and farce is the representation of the cosmic spirit, only Lokanuranjan
 "raasalila' kii parampara main lagbhag sau varsh se ramlila kaa pradarshan bhi aarambh hua he
 Its stage-legislative and classical environment is based on the method of "open-theater" rather than independent
 goswami tulsidas krit "ramcharita maanas' kii katha ko "ramlila' main prasang- viched kar kramik rup se prastut kiya jaataa he
 The plot of the mind is divided as needed
 lila- pradarshan 10 din se lekar 40 din tak kiya ja saktaa he
 Accordingly, the narrative is divided
 brajabhasha kaa natya- sahitya pustak kii paridhi main simat kar nahin panpa, apitu lok ke praangan main manch kii mandakini ban kar ras kii dhar bahaata rahaa
 If Brajbhasha is the urn of Rasa, then its Natya-tradition form - Madhuri's Sarita, which keeps the juice of joyful sensation flowing in the heart of the people from her ninja tomorrow

bukanakere Siddalingappa Yeddyurappa, is an Indian politician and the twenty-fifth Chief Minister of the Indian state of Karnataka, who was sworn in on 30 May 2008
 yediurppa karnataka rajya kii vidhansabha main shikaripura vidhansabha kshetra se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 He won the year 2014 Indian general election by a huge margin from Shimoga
 bhaajapa sanghathan main unhe rashtriya upaadhyaksh kaa pad diya gaya lekin rajya kii raajnneeti main unki sakriyata ko dekhte hue unhe rajya kaa adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 He became the Chief Minister of Karnataka after winning the Karnataka assembly elections in 2008
 ve saal 2007 main jad ke saath gathbandhan tuutane se pehle bhi thode samay ke liye karnataka ke mukhyamantri rahe
 He is the first Chief Minister of BJP in any South Indian state
 mukhyamantri rahete hue un par jameen aavanton main gadabadi ke aarope lage lekin haal hi main unako clinit mil gai he
 Yeddyurappa was born on 27 February 1943 in Buknakere village in Mandya district of Karnataka state, India
 
 His father's name was Siddalingappa and mother's name was Puttayamma
 yediurppa hindu dharm ke lingayat samudaay ke hai
 He was named after the Shaiva temple built by Saint Siddalingeshwar at Yeddyur place in Tumkur district of Karnataka
 jab yediurppa chaar saal ke the tab hi inaki mata kii maut ho gai
 He graduated from Arts
 1965 main ve samaaj kalyaan vibhaag ke pratham shrenee ke kiraani chue gaye
 But he moved to Shikaripur where he took a grocery job in Virbhadra Shastri's rice factories
 1967 main unhone virbhadra shastri kii putree maitradevi se shaadi kar lee
 Later, he opened a hardware shop in Shimoga
 yediurppa ke do putr, bi vaai raghavendra or vijayendra evam do putree hai, jinke naam, arunadevi, padmavati or umadevi hai
 His wife died in an accident in 2004
 2016 main unhen bhartiya janata party kii karnataka rajya ikai kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 The BJP contested the Karnataka assembly elections, 2018, by declaring him the chief ministerial candidate, but the party won 104 seats and fell short of 8 seats majority
 rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne bhaajapa ko sabase badi party hone ke naate sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya tathaa unhone mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 On 19 May 2019, Chief Minister Yeddyurappa announced his resignation without facing a vote of confidence and thus the two-day old Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka fell
 moa ek bhartiya mithai he
 The rest was a famous Ottoman poet of the sixteenth century
 iskaa puraa naam mahmud abdul baaqi tha or iskaa janmasthan kustutuniya he
 He was a person of a poor family but he got an opportunity to learn from the famous scholars of that time and also a satsang of Turkish high quality writers and poets
 18-19 varsh hi kii avasthaa main istabol ke prasiddh kaviyon main isaki gananaa hone lagi
 In 1555, when Sultan Suleiman Azam returned from the ascent of Iran, the rest presented him with an admirable ode to his majesty
 sultan ise sunakar itnaa prabhavit hua ki usne baaqi se apni kavitaaon par 'naziriye' likhane kaa aadesh diya
 In this way, its accessibility to the court and the society of the highest level was easily made sultan kii is krupa se swayan iske mitragan bhi jalane lage parantu yah turki kaa sabase bada kavi mana jane laga or isaki prasiddhi badi shighrata se puure rajya hi main nahin, pratyut hindustan tak fail gai
 Due to the special kindness of Sultan Suleiman, the rest got his near succession
 is kaaran sultan kii mrityu kaa isapar bada prabhaav padaa or isi prabhaav ke kaaran isane sultan kii smriti main ek marasia likhaa, jo isaki shreshth rachana maani jaati he
 The rest were also scholars of Arabic and Persian
 isane arabi kii bahut si pustakon kaa turki main anuwaad bhi kiya he or farsi bhashaa main kavita bhi kii he
 But its most popularity is due to the Turkish poetry itself, and it is not only ranked among the first class of poets of that era, it has also been called the title of the ghazal singers of Turkey
 gazalon ke sivaa iske qaside tathaa marasiye bhi kavyadrushti se purnataa tak pahunche hue hai
 Although it has benefited from the poetry of many of its predecessors, it has also retained its distinct personality
 acharya vinoba bhaave bharat ke swatantraaa sangram senaanee, saamaajik kaaryakarta tathaa prasiddh gandhivadi netaa the
 His original name was Vinayak Narhari Bhave
 unhe bharat kaa rashtriya aadhyaapak or mahatma gandhi kaa aadhyaatamik uttaradhikari samajha jaataa he
 He spent the last year of his life in an ashram in Ponar, Maharashtra
 unhone bhudaan aandolan chalaaya
 He was also in dispute for calling the Emergency declared by Indira Gandhi a 'discipline festival'
 vinoba bhaave kaa mul naam vinayak narhari bhaave tha
 Gagoda is a village in the Konkan region of Maharashtra
 The Chitpavans were Brahmins here, Narhari Bhave
 Mathematics lover and scientist
 He was interested in chemistry
 un dinon rangon ko baahar se aayaat karnaa padataa tha
 Narahari Bhave kept searching for colors night and day
 He was just a tune to make India self-sufficient in this matter
 unki mata rukmini bai vidhushi mahila thim
 Liberal-minded, all eight Yam were immersed in devotion
 It also affected their daily work
 man kahin ore rama hota to kabhi sabji main namak kam pad jaataa, kabhi zyada
 kabhi daal ke baghaar main hing daalana bhul jaatin to kabhi baghaar die bina hi daal paros di jaati
 puraa ghar bhakthi ras se sarabor rahata tha
 Therefore, no attention was paid to these small things
 usee satvik vaataavaran main 11 sitambar 1895 ko vinoba kaa janm hua
 His childhood name was Vinayak
 Mother used to call him affectionately as Vinya
 Apart from Vinoba, Rukmini Bai had two more sons: Valkoba and Shivaji
 Valkoba smaller than Vinayak
 Shivaji is the youngest
 The name Vinoba was given by Gandhiji
 maharashtra main naam ke peeche ‘ba’ lagane kaa jo chalan he, uske anusaar
 tucoba, vithoba or vinoba
 Vinayak's mother's nature was also found
 unka man bhi hameshaa aadhyatm chintan main leen rahata
 na unhen khaane-pine kii sud rahati thi
 Neither taste had a special identity
 maa jaisaa paros deteen, chupchaap kha lete
 rukmini bai kaa galaa bada hi madhur tha
 She would drown in listening to the hymn
 When she used to sing, she started to flow in full devotion in the whole environment
 They used to sing sweetly in the chants of Ramayana
 It seems like mother Sharda is lukewarm
 vinoba ko aadhyatm ke sanskaar dene, unhen bhakthi-vedant kii ore le jane main, bachapan main unke man main sanyas or vairaygy kii prerana jagaane main unki maa rukmini bai kaa bada yogadan tha
 The child Vinayak received the rites of both parents
 ganit kii sujh-boojh or tark-samathrya, vigyaan ke prati gahan anuraag, parampara ke prati vaigyanik drushtikon or tamaam tarah ke purvagrahon se alag hatakar sochane kii kala unhen pita kii ore se praapt hui
 While deep affection for religion and culture found by the mother, a sense of welfare of the living beings
 Positive attitude towards life, art of all religion, coexistence and respect
 Later Vinoba was considered as the spiritual heir of Gandhiji
 aaj bhi kuch log yahi kehete hai
 But this is a one-sided and one-sided analysis of Vinoba's character
 ve gandhi ji ke ‘aadhyatmik uttaradhikari’ se bahut aage, swatantra soch ke swami the
 The main thing is that Gandhi's brilliant halo could not be evaluated independently of his personality
 mahatma gandhi raajnneetik jeev the
 His spiritual consciousness was limited to the morning-evening aarti and worship
 jabaki unki dharmik-chetana unke raajnneetik kaaryakramon ke anukool or samanvyatmak thi
 There was no room for criticism and criticism
 dharm-darshan ke maamle main yun to vinoba bhi samarpan or sweekaarya-bhav rakhte the
 But whenever he got the opportunity, he explained the scriptures out of the box
 chaahe vah ‘gita pravachan’ hon yaa sant tukaraam ke abhangon par likhi gai pustak ‘santaprasad’
 isse usamen paryaapt moulikta or sahajata he
 This work could do only that which is free from anyone's intellectual halo
 ek baat yah bhi mahatma gandhi ke sanndhyi main aane se pehle hi vinoba aadhyatmik oonchai praapt kar chuke the
 Even after coming to the ashram, he used to take regular time for study and meditation
 vinoba se pehali hi mulaakaat main prabhavit hone par gandhi ji ne sahaj-man se kaha tha— Philosophy was his favorite subject
 ashram main daakhil hone ke kuch mahinon ke bheetar hi darshanashastra kii aage kii padhai ke liye unhone ek varsh kaa adhyayan avkaash liya tha
 Vinoba had two younger brothers like this, but Vinayak got the most of his mother
 bhaavnaatmak str par vinoba bhi khud ko apane pita kii apeksha maa ke adhik kareeb pate the
 The same situation was with Rukmini Bai, 'vinya' was the closest to his heart among the three sons
 ve bhajan-pujan ko samarpit rahati
 maa ke sanskaron kaa prabhaav
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon ke prati udaseenta or tyaag kii bhaavana kishoravastha main hi vinoba ke charitra kaa hissaa ban chuki thi
 The homeless corner would have made them more relaxed
 Silence would have made his conscience vocal
 He lived in the house, in the family among all, but such that even while living with everyone as if separate from him, clean and absolute
 Otherwise, to the mother, in her company
 'vinya' was much closer to his heart, his spiritual mind-building
 man ko koi uljhan ho to vahi sulajhane main madad karata
 koi aadhyatmik samasya ho to bhi vinya hi kaam aata
 yahaan tak ki yadi pati narhari bhaave bhi kuch kahen to usamen vinya kaa nirnay hi mahatvapurn hota tha
 It is not that Vinya was completely free or out of control
 parivaar kii aachaar samhita vinoba par bhi puri tarah lagu hoti thi
 Rather an incident of Vinoba's childhood
 rukmini bai ne bacchon ke liye ek niyam banaaya hua tha ki bhojan tulsi ke paughe ko pani dene ke baad hi milegaa
 vinya baahar se khelkar ghar pahunchate, bhukh se aakul-vyakul
 maa ke paas pahunchate hi kehete: Rukmini used to study the book 'das Bodh' of Samarth Guru Ramdas daily before sleeping
 Only then did she go to the bed
 It was only natural for the child to have this effect
 ve use sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev or shankaracharya kii kathaayen sunaatin
 ramayana, mahabharat kii kahaniyaan, upanishdon ke tatv gyaan ke bare main samajhaatin
 sanyas unki bhaawanaaon par savaar rahata
 lekin duniya se bhaagane ke bajaay logon se judane par ve jor deteen
 sansar se bhaagane ke bajaay usko badalane kaa aagrah karatin
 aksar kahatee—‘vinya, grihasthashram kaa bhalee-bhaanti paalan karne se pitaron ko mukti milti he
 'but on Vinya, the ghost of Guru Ramdas, Saint Dnyaneshwar and Shankaracharya used to ride
 All these Mahatmas boycotted their parents and family at a very young age for their spiritual fulfillment
 ve kehete— If there was another mother, she would have been shaken
 From the point of view, the sky would have lifted up on the head
 Because the general trend of people has become that renunciation, renunciation is a good thing, a matter of greatness, but only when renunciation and recluse are in the other's house
 Everyone wants to live a simple worldly life in their home
 magar rukmini bai to jaise kisi or hi mitti kii bani thim
 She lovingly explains to the son- betaa maa ke kahe ko aatmsaat karne kaa prayaas kar hi rahaa hota ki ve aage jod deteen- Vinoba was very intelligent in childhood
 Mathematics was his favorite subject
 kavita or aadhyatm chetana ke sanskaar maa se mili
 From them, the feeling of seeing both Root and Chetan with equal vision awakened
 Mother was very educated
 par unhone kii vinya ko aparigrah, astey ke bare main apane aacharan se bataaya
 While living in the world, taught him to be detached
 The mother's only effect was that Vinya would compose poetry and would burn them
 When everything in the world is temporary and fleeting, if nothing goes together then why should you be fascinated with your creation
 His mother would see all this, think, but say nothing
 As if she is preparing Vinya for the biggest sacrifice
 Vinoba's mathematical proficiency and his arguments were not hampered by his spiritual belief
 yadi kabhi donon ke bich spardhaa hoti bhi to jeet aadhyatmik vishwaas kii hi hoti
 aaj ve ghatnaayen maa-bete ke aapasi sneh-anuraag or vishwaas kaa aitihaasik dastavej hai
 Rukmini Bai used to donate one lakh grains of rice every month
 ek lakh kii ginati karnaa bhi aasaan na tha, so ve puure maheene ek-ek chaaval ginati rahati
 narhari bhaave patni ko chaaval ginate main shram karte dekh muskaraate
 kam umr main hi aankh kamjor pad jane se dar sataane lagata
 unki ganit buddhi kuch or hi kahati
 so ek din unhone rukmini bai ko tok hi diya—‘is tarah ek-ek chaaval ginaney main samay jaaya karne kii jarurat hi kya he
 Take a loaf of rice
 Count them Then take out the weight of one lakh rice from it and weigh it
 If there is no shortage, then put a few fists from above
 It was argued
 loukik samajhadaari bhi isi main thi ki jab bhi sambhav ho, duusare jaruri kaaryon ke liye samay kii bachat kii jaae
 rukmini bai ko pati kaa tark samaj to aata
 par man na maanata
 ek din unhone apni duvidha vinya ke saamne prakat karne ke baad poocha— The son heard everything, thought
 bolaa, ‘maa, pita ji ke tark main dam he
 This is what mathematics says
 kintu daan ke liye chaaval ginana sirf ginati karnaa nahin he
 While counting, we not only take the name of God with every rice, but our mind is also attached to it
 ’ ishwar ke naam par daan ke liye chaaval ginana bhi ek sadhana he, rukmini bai ne aisa pehle kahaan sochaa tha
 Rukmini Bai, who is fully immersed in Adhyatmarasas, liked the things of 'vinya'
 He used to be proud of his son
 He did not stop counting the rice even further
 Nor did his mind ever awaken to futility
 aisi hi ek or ghatana he
 Which shows how Vinoba Corey discovered metaphysics in mathematical calculations
 ghatana us samay kii he jab ve gandhi ji ke ashram main pravesh kar chuke the tathaa unke rachanaatmak kaaryon main bad-chadhakar hissaa le rahe the
 Prayer meetings take place in the ashram in the morning and evening
 The ashram dwellers who attend them are regularly counted
 This responsibility was a worker
 prasang yah he ki ek din prarthana sabha ke baad jab us kaaryakarta ne prarthana main upasthit hue aagantukon kii sankhya bataai to vinoba jhat se pratwaad karte hue bole— The worker believed in his count, so he too stood firm
 karm man vishwaas rakhane vaale vinoba aamtaur par bahes main padane se bachate the
 But on that day too, they were adamant
 ashram main vivaadon kaa niptaan baapu kii adaalat main hota tha
 Gandhiji believed in his worker
 magar jaanate the ki vinoba yun hi bahes main nahin padane vaale
 vaastaviktaa jaanane ke liye unhone vinoba kii ore dekha
 tab vinoba ne kaha—‘prarthana main sammilit shraddhaluon kii sankhya jitani inhone bataai usase ek kam hi thi
 ' 'how?' 'because a man's full attention was focused on counting the gentlemen present there
 ’ gandhiji vinoba kaa tark samaj gaye
 What is the need of accounts and appearances in the work of prayer
 Further, the work of counting the people who came to the prayer meeting was stopped
 yuvavastha ke praarambhik daur main hi vinoba aajanm brahmacharee rahane kii thaan chuke the
 The same great men were his ideals who had asceticism in childhood to seek truth
 or jab sanyas dhaaran kar brahmacharee bananaa he, grihasth jivan se naata hi todna he to kyon na man ko usee ke anuroop taiyaar kiya jaae
 kyon ulajhaa jaae sambandhon kii mithi door, sansaarik pralobhanon main
 brahmacharya kii to pehali shart yahi he ki man ko bhatakane se roka jaae
 vaasanaon par niyantran rahe
 Someone had told Kishore Vinayak that Brahmachari should not attend any wedding feast
 ve aise kaaryakramon main jane se aksar bachate bhi the
 Father Narhari Bhave was there, if anyone else had known, the younger brother would have gone
 Vinoba's body was weak
 bachapan se hi koi na koi vyaadhi lagi rahati
 magar man-mastishk puri tarah chaitanya
 maano sharir kii sari shaktiyaan simatakar dimag main samaa gai haa
 smriti vilakshan thi
 Kishore Vinayak had well memorized hundreds of verses of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev along with the Vedas, Upanishads
 gita unhen bachapan se hi kanthsth thi
 Later on, forty thousand verses were also well rumored in his mind
 vinayak kii badi bahan kaa vivaah tay hua to maano pariksha kii ghadi bhi kareeb aa gai
 He decided that he would stay away from the feast on the occasion of marriage
 No one should interrupt, so they announced to keep fast that day
 bahan ke vivaah main bhai upwas rakhe, yah bhi uchit na tha
 Father got angry on hearing this
 magar maa ne baat sambhaal lee
 He persuaded the son to eat simple 'dal-bhat'
 yahi nahin apane haathon se alag pakaakar bhi diya
 Married to grandeur
 vinayak ne khushi-khushi usamen hissaa liya
 But i had to live only for my mother with specially made pulses
 maa-bete kaa yah prem aage bhi bana rahaa
 Later, when he left home to retire, he carried a red-edged dhoti of mother and a statue from their worship house
 murti to unhone duusare ko bhent kar di thi
 But the mother's dhoti would carry with her wherever she went
 While sleeping, keeping the headrest
 Like walking around with mother's blessings
 Even the ascetic could not escape the memory of his mother
 maa ke sanskaar hi vinoba kii aadhyatmik chetana kii neenv bane
 His biography developed on him
 aage chalakar unhone rachanaatmakataa or aadhyatm ke kshetra main jo khyaati arjeet kii uske mul main bhi maa kii hi preranaayen thim
 Rukmini Bai was less educated
 sanskrit samaj nahin aati thim
 But the mind was that there was a longing for Gita and knowledge
 One day the mother put her difficulty before the son- vinoba dharmik sanskaron main paakhand ke virdohi the
 At the time of his mother's death, Vinoba had differences with his father and brothers
 vinoba brahmanon ke haath se paramparaagat tareeke se dah-sanskaar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 But in front of the family's insistence, they did not do one
 Vinoba too stood firm on his principles
 nateeja yah ki jis maa ko ve sabase adhik chaahate the, jo unki aadhyatmik guru thim, unke antim sanskaar se ve dur hi rahe
 He bid farewell to the mother with silent eyes
 aage chalakar 29 oktober 1947 ko vinoba ke pita kaa nidhan hua to unhone vedon ke nirdesh ki ‘mitti par mitti kaa hi adhikaar he’ kaa paalan karte hue unki deh ko agni-samarpit karne ke bajaay, mitti main dabaane jor diya
 By then Vinoba saints had become Vinoba
 gandhi ji kaa unhen aashirwad tha
 So this time they did it
 maa kii gita main aasthaa thi
 She was entrusted with the task of translating Geeta into Marathi to Vinoba
 vinoba us kaary main manoyog se lage the
 Finally the translation work is complete
 pustak kaa naam rakhaa gaya- gitai
 gita+ai = gitai
 maharashtra main ‘ai’ kaa abhipraay ‘maa ke prati’ se he; yani maa kii smriti uske neh se judi-rachi gita
 putr kii kriti ko dekhne ke liye to rukmini bai jivit nahin thim
 But Geetai, associated with his memory and desire, started getting mired in the grief of mothers and sisters from house to house in Maharashtra
 unki aadhyatm chetana kaa aabhushan ban gai
 When Gandhiji listened, he praised the translation work
 jo mahilaayein sanskrit nahin jaanati thim, jinhen apni bhashaa kaa bhi aadha-adhuraa gyaan tha, unke liye sahaj-saral bhashaa main rachi gai ‘gitai’, gita kii aadhyatmikta main doobane ke liye vardaan ban gai
 Vinoba's rites received from his mother in his childhood continued to get thicker in his youth
 yuvavastha kii ore badhate hue vinoba na to sant gyaneshwar ko bhula paae the, na tukaraam ko
 That was his ideal
 sant tukaraam ke abhang to ve bade hi manoyog se gaate
 unka apane aradhy se ladanaa-jhagadna, naaraaz hokar gaali dena, ruuthana-manaanaa unhen bahut acha lagata
 sant ramdaas kaa jivan bhi unhen prerana detaa
 ve na shankaracharya ko vismrit kar paae the, na unke sanyas ko
 Darshan was his favorite subject
 himalay jab se hosh sambhala tha, tabhi se unki sapanom main aata tha or ve kalpana main swayan ko satya kii khoj main gahan kandaraon main tap-sadhana karte hue pate
 vahaan kii nirjan, varf se dhaki deergh-gahan kandaraon main unhen paramasatya kii khoj main leen ho jane ke liye uksaatin
 In 1915 he passed the High School examination
 ab aage kya padhaa jaae
 vaigyanik pravriti ke pita or aadhyatm main dubi rahane vaali maa kaa vaicharik dwandv vahaan bhi alag-alag dhaaraon main prakat hua
 Father said - 'read French
' Mother said - 'brahmin's son should not read Sanskrit, how is it possible!' Vinoba kept the mind of both of them
 inter main french ko chunaa
 He continued to study Sanskrit at a personal level
 un dinon french gyaan-vigyaan ke kshetra main ho rahi kranti kii bhashaa thi
 All the transformative literature was being created in it
 duusari ore baroda kaa pustkaalay durlabh pustakon, pandulipiyon ke khajaane ke liye puure desh main prasiddh tha
 Vinoba made that library his second destination
 vidhyalay se jaise hi chuttee milti, ve pustkaalay main jaakar adhyayan main dub jate
 francisi sahitya ne vinoba kaa parichay pashchimi deshon main ho rahi vaicharik kranti se karaayaa
 sanskrit ke gyaan ne unhen vedon or upanishdon main gaharaai se paithne kii yogyata di
 If the level of knowledge increased, then his ardor also increased
 But the attraction of the Himalayas from the mind, the practice of renunciation, did not go away
 un dinon inter kii pariksha ke liye mumbai janaa padataa tha
 Vinoba also boarded a train going to Mumbai on 25 March 1916 as per schedule
 At that time, his mind was turbulent
 puraa vishwaas tha ki hiskool kii tarah inter kii pariksha bhi paas kar hi lenge
 magar uske baad kya? kya yahi unke jivan kaa lakshya he? vinoba ko lag rahaa tha ki apane jivan main ve jo chaahate hai, vah aupchaarik adhyayan dwaara sambhav nahin
 The certificates of the school and the degrees of the college are not his intention
 railgadee apni gati se bhaag rahi thi
 Vinoba's mind was running faster than him
 After all, victory was of the mind
 jaise hi gaadi surat pahunchi, vinoba usase neeche utar aae
 The car moved forward but Vinoba's mind went on pulling to the other side
 duusare platform par purv kii ore jane vaali railgadee maujuud thi
 Vinoba felt that the Himalayas were once again inviting him
 grihasth jivan yaa sanyas
 man main kuch der tak sangharsh chalaa
 uhapoh se guzarate hue unhone unhone nirnay liya or usee gaadi main savaar ho gaye
 The Saints set out on their favorite journey
 Unaware of the fact that this time also the journey for which they have set out, is not their real journey, but only a halt
 jivan se palaayan unki niyati nahin
 He has to emerge as a hope for the lives of millions and millions of Indians
 brahm kii khoj, satya kii khoj, sanyas lene kii saadh main vinoba bhatak rahe the
 He left home with the same goal
 himalay kii ore yatra jari thi
 Kashi came to a halt in the middle
 mithkon ke anusaar bhagwaan shankar kii nagari
 hajaaron varshon tak dharm-darshan kaa centre rahi kaashi
 sadhu-santon or vichaarkon kaa kumbh
 jigyaasuon or gyaan-pipaasuon ko apni ore aakarshith karne vaali pavitra dharmasthali
 shankaracharya tak khud ko kaashi-yatra ke pralobhan se nahin roak paae the
 At the Ganga Ghat in Kashi, where new ideas flourish, Vittanda was also composed countless times
 usee ganga tat par vinoba bhatak rahe the
 Looking for a destination for yourself
 In search of a Guru who can show them the way forward
 jis lakshya ke liye unhone ghar choda tha, us lakshya tak pahunchane kaa maarg bataa sake
 While wandering, they reached a place where some truth-seekers were discussing
 vishay tha advait or dwait main koun sahi
 prashn kaaphi purana tha
 About twelve hundred years ago, there was a decisive debate on this
 shankaracharya or mandan mishra ke bich
 us aitihaasik bahes main dwaitvaadi mandan mishra or unki patni ko shankaracharya ne parajeet kiya tha
 The same subject was again caught between those truth-seekers
 yaa kaho ki vakt kaatane ke liye donon paksh apane-apane tarkon ke saath vitanda rach rahe the
 And then, leading the debate to a conclusion, it was suddenly announced that the monotheist had won
 vinoba chanke
 unki hansi chhot gai— On the one hand Vinoba was wandering on the ghats, in the streets of Kashi, seeking solace, in the practice of renunciation
 vahiin duusari ore ek or jigyaasu bharat ko jaanane, uske hridaypradesh kii dhadakanon ko pahchaanane, usase atmiyata bharaa rishta kaayam karne ke liye bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua hua tha
 He returned from South Africa a few months ago after gaining immense fame
 aage uski yojana bhartiya raajnneeti main dakhal dene kii thi
 The name of that seeker was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
 At the behest of his political mentor, Govind Ballabh Pant, he set out on a year-long tour of India for the purpose of knowing the soul of India
 aage chalakar bhartiya raajnneeti par chaa jane, karodon bharatiyon ke dil kii dhadkan, bhartiya swadhinata andolan kaa pramukh sutaradhar, ahimsak senaanee ban jane vaale gandhi un dinon aprasiddh hi the
 The title of 'mahatma' was also far from them
 sirf dakshin africa main chhede gaye andolan kii puunji hi unke saath thi
 Because of that he was known all over India
 un dinon unka padaav bhi kaashi hi tha
 It was as if time was playing its magic game to introduce two great souls
 kaashi main mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya dwaara sthapit hindu vishvavidhyalay main ek bada jalsa ho rahaa tha
 On February 4, 1916, raje-maharaja, Nabav, Samant were all present in the procession
 sammelan kii chata dekhte hi banati thi
 Gandhi gave a historic speech at that conference
 vah kaha jisaki us samay koi ummid nahin kar saktaa tha
 In time, Gandhi ji openly criticized the king and feudal lords, who were well-to-do by the British themselves, whose donations were run by Kashi University and other institutions, and said that Gandhiji should use his wealth for the nation building
 
 usko garibon ke kalyaan main lagaaein
 unhone awahn kiya ki ve vyapak lokhit main apane saare aabhushan daan kar den
 She had a revolutionary appeal
 sabha main khalabali much gai
 But Gandhi's smile remained the same
 agle din us sammelan kii khabaron se akhbaar range pade the
 Vinoba learned about Gandhiji only through the newspaper
 And they felt that the goal they had left home in search of was fulfilled
 vinoba kori shanti kii talash main hi ghar se nahin nikle the
 Neither were they unfamiliar with the situation in the country and the inhuman atrocities being committed by the British
 magar koi raah mil hi nahin rahi thi
 After reading the speech, he felt that this person has peace as well as revolution
 He wrote a letter to Gandhiji from there
 Answer came
 gandhi ji ke aamantran ke saath
 vinoba to uski pratiksha kar hi rahe the
 He immediately left for the Cochrab Ashram in Ahmedabad, where Gandhiji had his ashram
 7 june 1916 ko vinoba kii gandhi se pehali bhent hui
 After that Vinoba remained as Gandhiji
 gandhi ji ne bhi vinoba kii pratibha ko pahchaan liya tha
 So his comment after the first meeting was that most people come here to get something, this is the first person who came to give something
 ’ kaaphi din baad apni pehali bhent ko yaad karte hue vinoba ne kaha tha— The meeting between Gandhi and Vinoba was revolutionary
 gandhi ji ko jaise hi pataa chalaa ki vinoba apane mata-pita ko bina bataae aae hai, unhone vahiin se vinoba ke pita ke naam ek patr likhaa ki vinoba unke saath surakshit hai
 After that their relationship continued to deepen
 vinoba ne khud ko gandhi ji ke ashram ke liye samarpit kar diya
 From studies, teaching, spinning, farming work to community life, he was ahead in every activity of the ashram
 Gandhiji's statement that this young man has come to take nothing from the ashram residents but to give it was becoming true
 umr se ekadam yuva vinoba unhen anushaasan or kartavyaparayanata kaa paath to padhaa hi rahe the
 Gandhiji's influence was growing rapidly
 utani hi teji se bad rahi ashram main aane vaale kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya
 kocharab ashram chota padane laga to ahmedabad main sabarmati ke kinare nae ashram kaa kaam teji se hone laga
 lekin aazaadee ke ahimsak sainik taiyaar karne kaa kaam akele sabarmati ashram se bhi sambhav bhi na tha
 Gandhi also wanted the same ashram in Wardha
 vahaan par aise anushaasit kaaryakarta kii aavashyaktaa thi, jo ashram ko gandhi ji ke aadarshon ke anuroop chalaa sake
 iske liye vinoba sarvatha anukool paatr the or gandhi ji ke vishwasaneey bhi
 8 april 1923 ko vinoba wardha ke liye prasthaan kar gaye
 There he started editing the 'maharashtra Dharma' monthly
 marathi main prakashit hone vaali is patrika main vinoba ne niyamit rup se upanishdon or maharashtra ke santon par likhnaa aarambh kar diya, jinke kaaran desh main bhakthi andolan kii shuruyaat hui thi
 The magazine gained unexpected popularity, shortly after that it had to be weekly, Vinoba was still known as Gandhiji's disciple and satyagrahi
 patrika ke madhyam se janata unki aadhyatmik paith ko jaanane lagi thi
 At the time of World War II, the United Kingdom was being forced into a war by the United Kingdom against which a personal satyagraha was started on 17 October 1940 and Vinoba was made the first Satyagrahi by Gandhiji
 apana satyagrah shuru karne se pehle apane vichaar spasht karte hue vinoba ne ek vaktavy jari kiya tha
 It said that aage unhone itnaa or kaha - In his speeches Vinoba used to tell the people that through negative programs neither peace can be established nor war can be ended

mashruvala kii pustak gandhi or marks prakashit hui or vinoba ne isaki bhoomika likhi
 In this, Vinoba showed great respect for Marx
 karl marks ko unhone vichaarak mana tha
 a thinker who had genuine sympathy for the poor
 vaise to marks ki soch main vinoba ko khot dikhi thi or lakshya par pahunchane ke tareeke ko lekar marks se unhone apana matbhed vyakt kiya
 Vinoba believed that communists arose because of the rich people
 vinoba kaa viswas tha ki har baat main barabari kaa siddhant lagu hona chahie
 He had said: Police action cannot be helpful to end the terror of communists
 isko jad se samaapt kiya jaae
 No matter how confused they may be, Vinoba did not consider the Communists to be destroyers and by arguing with them and expressing active sympathy for their aims, Vinoba wanted them on the right path
 bisiyon bhashaaon ke gyaata vinoba ji devanagari ko vishwa lipi ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate the
 For India, he favored developing Devanagari as a contact script

 Inspired by his ideas, Nagari script Sangam has been established which works to use and spread Devanagari within India and outside India
 vistrut jaankaree ke liye nagari evam bhartiya bhashaayen padhen
 Vinobaji was always a social and creative activist
 swatantrata ke purv gandhiji ke rachaanatmak kaaryon main sakriy rup se yogadan dete rahe
 His health started deteriorating due to work, he was advised by a doctor to go to a hill station
 at: 1937 i0 main vinoba bhaave pawanaar ashram main gayi
 Since then, this has been the central place to start his creative work throughout his life
 rachaanatmak kaaryon ke atiritk ve mahaan swatantraaa senaanee bhi the
 He was imprisoned in the Nagpur Flag Satyagraha
 1937 main gandhiji jab landan kii golmes conference se khaali haath lote to jalgaanv main vinoba bhaave ne ek sabha main angrejon kii aalochana kii to unhen bandi banaakar chah maah kii sajaa di gayi
 After being freed from prison, Gandhiji made him the first Satyagrahi
 17 oktober 1940 ko vinoba bhavaji ne satyagrah kiya or ve bandi banaaye gayi tathaa unhen 3 varsh ke liye sashram karawas kaa dand mila
 Gandhiji consulted Vinobaji in 1942 before leaving India

 Gaban is a novel composed by Premchand
 ‘nirmala’ ke baad ‘gaban’ premchand kaa doosraa yathartwaadee upanyaas he
 Must say that this is the sequel to its development
 gaban kaa mul vishay he - 'mahilaon kaa pati ke jivan par prabhaav'
 Gaban is a novel related to a particular worrying topic of Premchand
 yah vishay he, gahanon ke prati patni ke lagaav kaa pati ke jivan par prabhaav
 The real depiction of the middle class wandering in the darkness of the values crumbling in the drone was made
 inhone samjhautaparast or mahatvakanksha se purna manovriti tathaa police ke charitra ko bebaaki se prastut karte hue kahani ko jeevant bana diya gaya he
 In this novel, Premchand has seen the first women's problem in a broader Indian perspective and linked it to the then Indian independence movement
 saamaajik jivan or katha-sahitya ke liye yah ek nai disha kii ore sanket karata he
 This novel explores the reality of life more deeply, breaking the illusion
 nae raste talashne ke liye pathak ko nai prerana detaa he
 The heroine of 'gaban', Jalpa, is eager to get a moon
 uskaa pati kam vetan vaala clerk he yadhyapi vah apni patni ke saamne bahut amir hone kaa abhinay karata he
 To satisfy his wife, he smokes from his office and runs away to Calcutta where a bier and his wife shelter him
 dakaiti ke ek jaali maamle main police use fansaakar mubir kii bhoomika main prastut karti he
 His wife arrives in Calcutta, filled with rage, and helps him get out of prison
 isi bich police kii taanaashaahee ke viruddh ek badi jan-jagriti shuru hoti he
 In this novel, the reader experiences the touch of the vast mass movements
 laghu ghatnaon se aarambh hokar rashtriya jivan main bade-bade tufaan uth khadey hote hai
 The culmination of Jalpa from a greedy woman of petty instinct to a national heroine is the culmination of Premchand's pen's artistry
 isamen do kathanak hai - ek prayag se sambaddh or doosraa kolkata se sambaddh
 Both plotlines are interlinked by Jalpaki arbitration
 kathanak main anaavashyak ghatnaon or vistaar kaa abhaav he
 Mahasadh Deendayal, the headman of the zamindar of Prayag's small village, and Jalpa, the only daughter of Manki, had longed for jewelery, especially Chandrahar, since childhood
 vah swapn dekhati thi ki vivaah ke samay uske liye chandrahaar zarur chadhega
 When he was married to Ramanath, the useless son of servant Munshi Dayanath in the court, there were more ornaments in the offering, Chandrahar was not there
 isse jalpa ko ghor niraashaa hui
 Deendayal and Dayanath both spent more than their wedding in marriage
 dayanath ne kachhari main rahete hue rishwat kii kamai se munh mode rakhaa tha
 In the marriage of the son, he fell in debt
 dayanath to chandrahaar bhi chadhaanaa chaahate the lekin unki patni jageshwari ne unka prastaav radd kar diya tha
 a Sakhi princess of Jalpa instigates her to obtain Chandrahar
 jalpa chandrahaar kii tech lekar hi sasuraal gayi
 The condition of the house was poor, but Ramanath had taken great pride of his family in front of Jalpa
 karz utaarne ke liye jab pita ne jalpa ke kuch gahane chupake se laane ke liye kaha to ramanath kuch maansik sangharsh ke baad aabhushanon kaa sandook chupake se uthaakar unhen de aate he or jalpa se chori ho jane kaa bahaanaa kar dete hai kintu apane is kapatpurna vyavhaar se unhen aatmaglani hoti he, visheshat: jab ki ve apni patni se atyadhik prem karte hai
 Jalpa's life becomes angry
 ab ramanath ko naukari kii chintaa hoti he
 He gets a monthly job of thirty rupees in octroi with the help of his chess companions Vidhur and Ramesh Babu, a taxman
 jalpa ko ve apana vetan chalis rupee bataate hai
 At the same time, Jalpa receives a Chandrahar sent by her mother, but she does not accept it as a donation in kindness
 ab ramanath main jalpa ke liye gahane banavaane kaa hausala paidaa hota he
 This confidence is fulfilled even when they are laden with debt
 indubhushan vakil kii patni ratan ko jalpa ke jadaau kangan bahut achche lagate hai
 Similarly, she gives 600 rupees to Ramanath for fetching the bracelet
 sarraf in rupayon ko karjkhaate main jamaakar ramanath ko kangan udhaar dene se inkaar kar detaa hai
 Ratan continues to look for the bracelets equally
 ant main vah apane rupee hi waapas laane ke liye kahati he
 With the thought of returning his rupees, Ramanath brings home only Rs
 unki anupasthiti main jab ratan apane rupee maangane aati hai to jalpa unheen rupayon ko uthaakar de detii hai
 When Ramanath came to know about coming home, he was very worried
 gaban ke maamle main unki sazaa ho sakati thi
 Explaining the whole situation, he wrote a letter to his wife
 ve use apni patni ko dene yaa na dene ke bare main soch hi rahe the, ki vah patr jalpa ko mil jaataa hai
 Seeing her read the letter, they feel so self-deluded that they run away from home, Jalpa returns her tax money by selling her jewelry
 iske pashchaat katha kalkatte kii ore mudati he
 In Calcutta, Ramanath opens a tea shop after secretly staying with his benevolent Devidin Khatik for a few days
 ve apni vaastaviktaa chhipaae rahete hai
 One day while they were returning from watching the drama, the police catch them in Shubeh
 ghabrahat main ramanath apane gaban aadi ke bare main sari katha suna dete hai
 The policemen by their investigations do not leave them innocent and present them as witnesses of a case against the revolutionaries
 jail- jivan se bhaybheet hone ke kaaran ramanath pulisavaalon kii baat maan lete hai
 The police put them comfortably in a bungalow and a prostitute named Zohra was appointed to entertain them
 udhar jalpa ratan ke paraamarsh se shatranj- sambandhi 50 / - kaa ek vigyaapan prakashit karti he
 The person who won the advertisement was Ramanath and this made Jalpa aware that he was in Calcutta
 khojate- khojate vah devidin khatic ke yahan pahunch jaati he or ramanath ko police ke kuchakr se nikaalane kii asafal cheshtaa karti he
 Ratan also comes to Calcutta to treat her old husband on the same day
 pati kii mrityu ke baad vah jalpa kii sahaayta karne main kisi prakaar kaa sankoch prakat nahin karti
 After testifying against the revolutionaries, he received a letter from Jalpa, which changed his sentiment
 unhone jaj ke saamne sari vaastaviktaa prakat kar di, jisase usko vishwaas ho gaya ki nirparaadh vyaktiyon ko dand diya gaya he
 The judge withdrew his first decision
 ramanath, jalpa, johra aadi waapas aakar prayag ke sameep rahane lage
 The self-esteem rises again in Ramanath due to the Jalpa
 zohara vaishya- jivan chhodkar seva- vrath dhaaran karti he
 Ramanath and Jalpa also follow the seva-marg
 johra ne apni seva, aatm- tyaag or saral swabhaav se sabhi ko mugdh kar liya tha
 Ratan died
 ek baar prayag ke sameep ganga main duubate hue yatri ko bachaate samay bhi bah gayi
 Ramanath tried to go ahead to save him
 jalpa bhi pani main kud padi thi
 Ramanath could not proceed
 ek shakti aage khinchati thi, ek peeche
 The power ahead was Anurag, despair, sacrifice
 bandhan ne roak liya
 Zohra was an item of luxury in Calcutta
 prayag main uske ghar ke praani- jaisaa vyavhaar hota tha
 Dayanath and Rameshwari were pacified by saying that she is the widowed daughter-in-law of Devidin
 johra main aatmshuddhi kii jyoti jagamaga uthi thi
 Ramanath and Jalpa return home with their weak hope
 unki aankhon ke saamne johra kii tasviir khadi ho jaati thi
