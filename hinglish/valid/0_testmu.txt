 Man should not take revenge in anger and learn to forgive
 unhone spasht rup se kaha ki ve hi ishwar ke putr hai, ve hi messiah hai or swarg or mukti kaa maarg hai
 The Day of Judgment had no special mention or significance in Judaism, but Jesus emphasized the Day of Judgment - because heaven or hell would receive the human soul at the same time

 The rabbinic rabbis of the Jews strongly opposed Jesus

 Therefore, he complained to the Roman governor Pilate at that time

 yahi dharm isai dharm kahalaaya
 When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judea, in the days of Herod King, behold, many astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem and asked
 ki yahudiyon kaa raja jis kaa janm hua he, kahaan he? kyonki ham ne purv main uskaa tara dekha he or us ko pranaam karne aae hai
 Hearing this, Herod the king and all Jerusalem with him were terrified
 or us ne logon ke sab mahayajakon or shastriyon ko ikatthe karke un se poocha, ki messiah kaa janm kahan hona chahie? unhone us se kaha, yahudiya ke baitalaham main; kyonki bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara yon likhaa he
 That you, Bethlehem, who is in the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the officials of Judah; For out of you will come a ruler, who will take care of my people Israel
 tab herodes ne jyotishiyon ko chupake se bulaakar un se poocha, ki tara thik kis samay dikhaai diya tha
 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "go and find out exactly about that child, and when he meets, tell me the news so that i too may come and bow to him
" ve raja kii baat sunakar chale gaye or dekho, jo tara unhone purv main dekha tha, vah un ke aage aage chalaa or janha balak tha, us jagah ke upar panhuchakar thahar gaya
 us taare ko dekhakar ve ati anandit hue
 And when he reached that house, he saw the child with his mother Mary and fell on his face and bowed to him; And he opened his bag and offered him gold and myrrh and myrrh
 or swapn main yah chituni paakar ki herodes ke paas phir na janaa, ve duusare maarg se hokar apane desh ko chale gaye
 un ke chale jane ke baad dekho, prabhu ke ek doot ne swapn main yusuf ko dikhaai dekar kaha, uth; us balak ko or us kii mata ko lekar misr desh ko bhaag ja; or jab tak main tujh se na kahuun, tab tak vahiin rahanaa; kyonki herodes is balak ko dhundhane par he ki use marava daale
 He got up at night and took the boy and his mother and went to Egypt
 or herodes ke marane tak vahiin rahaa; isaliye ki vah vachan jo prabhu ne bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara kaha tha ki main ne apane putr ko misr se bulaayaa puraa ho
 When Herod saw that the astrologers had mocked me, he was filled with anger; And sending people to Bethlehem and all the boys around it, who were two years old or younger, according to the exact time asked by the astrologers
 tab jo vachan yirmayaah bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara kaha gaya tha, vah puraa hua, ki ramah main ek karun-naad sunai diya, ronaa or bada vilaap, rahel apane baalkon ke liye ro rahi thi or shant hona na chaahati thi, kyonki ve hai nahin
 herodes ke marane ke baad dekho, prabhu ke doot ne misr main yusuf ko swapn main dikhaai dekar kaha
 Take up the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel; Because those who wanted to kill the child died
 vah uthaa or balak or us kii mata ko saath lekar israel ke desh main aayaa
 But upon hearing that Arkylaus is ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; And after getting a reminder of the dream, he went into the land of Galilee
 or nasarat naam nagar main ja basaa; taaki vah vachan puraa ho, jo bhavishyadvaktaaon ke dwaara kaha gaya tha, ki vah nasri kehalaayegaa
 And the child grew and grew strong and filled with wisdom; And the grace of God was on him
 uske mata-pita prati varsh fasah ke parv main jerushlem ko jaaya karte the
 When he was twelve years old, he went to Jerusalem according to the festival
 or jab ve un dinon ko puraa karke lautne lage, to vah ladkaa yishu jerushlem main rah gaya; or yah uske mata-pita nahin jaanate the
 They, thinking that he would be with the other passengers, went off for a day: and began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances
 par jab nahin mila, to dhundhate-dhundhate jerushlem ko phir laut gaye
 And after three days they found him sitting among the preachers in the temple, listening to them and questioning them
 or jitne us kii sun rahe the, ve sab us kii samaj or uske uttaron se chakit the
 Then they were surprised to see him and his mother said to him; Son, why did you treat us like this? See, your father and i used to look for you with a grudge
 us ne un se kaha; tum mujhe kyon dhundhate the? kya nahin jaanate the, ki mujhe apane pita ke bhawan main hona avashya he? parantu jo baat us ne un se kahi, unhone use nahin samajha
 Then he went with them and came to Nazareth and was under their control; And his mother kept all these things in her mind
 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in the grace of God and men
 chhathwein maheene main parameshwar kii ore se jibrail swargadoot galeel ke nasarat nagar main ek kunvaari ke paas bheja gaya
 Whose marriage was made to a man of the house of David named Joseph: the virgin was named Mary
 or swargadoot ne uske paas bheetar aakar kaha; anand or jai teri ho, jis par ishwar kaa anugrah hua he, prabhu tere saath he
 She was very nervous with that promise and started thinking, what kind of greeting is this? The angel said to him, Mary! Do not be afraid, because the grace of God is upon you
 or dekh, tu garbhvatee hogi or tere ek putr utpann hoga; tu uskaa naam yishu rakhana
 that would be great; And will be called the son of the Most High; And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
 or vah yaqub ke gharaane par sadaa rajya karegaa; or uske rajya kaa ant na hoga
 Mary said to the angel, how will this happen? i do not even know the man
 swargadoot ne us ko uttar diya; ki pavitra aatma tujh par utrega or parampradhan kii samarth tujh par chaaya karegi isaliye vah pavitra jo utpann honevaala he, parameshwar kaa putr kehalaayegaa
 Jesus showed many more signs to the disciples, which were not written in this book
 parantu ye isaliye likhe gaye hai, ki tum vishwaas karo, ki yishu hi parameshwar kaa putr messiah he: or vishwaas kar ke uske naam se jivan paao
 
 yah bahut achche insaan the jiske sir par haath vah dhanya ho jaataa tha yeshu ne apane jivan main anginat chamatkaar kiye jo prithvi par kisi or ke liye naammumkin the In the Bible of Islam, Jesus is considered a venerable prophet who God sent to the Israelites to spread his message
 quran main isa ke naam kaa zikr mohammad se bhi zyaada he or musulmaan isa ke kunari dwaara janm main maanate hai
 In Islam, Jesus is considered a mere mortal, like all prophets and not a member of god-son or Trinity, and their worship is forbidden
 unhen chamatkaar karne kii kshamta ishwar se mili thi or khud isa messiah main aisi shaktiyaan nahin maujuud thim
 It is also not believed that he hung on the cross
 islamic parampara ke mutabiq, cross par marane ke ba-vajood, ishwar ne unhen sidhe swarg main uthaaya gaya tha
 Like all prophets, Jesus Christ is called a Muslim in the Quran
 quran ke mutabiq, isa messiah ne apane aap ko ishwar-putr kabhi nahin mana or ve qayamat ke din par is baat kaa inkaar karenge
 The Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, Jesus Christ will return to Earth and exercise justice
 quran main isa kaa naam 25 baar aayaa he
 There is a story of his birth in Surah Maryam and similarly in Surah Ali Imran
 mohammad ke hadison main he ki "tamaam nabi bhai he or isa messiah mere sabase kareebi bhai he kyunki mere or isa messiah ke darmiyaan koi nabi nahi aayaa he"
 Jesus said to them, It is written like this; That Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
 or jerushlem se lekar sab jatiyon main man phiraav kaa or paapon kii kshamaa kaa prachaar, usee ke naam se kiya jayega
 You are witness to all these things
 or dekho, jis kii pratigya mere pita ne kii he, main us ko tum par utaaruunga or jab tak swarg se samarth na paao, tab tak tum isi nagar main tehre raho
tab vah unhen baitaniyyah tak baahar le gaya or apane haath uthaakar unhen ashish di
 And blessing them, he broke away from them and was taken from heaven
 or ve us ko dandvat karke bade anand se jerushlem ko laut gaye
 And constantly present in the temple and praise God
 yahudee isa messiah ko na to maseehaa maanate hai na ishwar-putr
 They still wait for their Messiah

 He moved to India a few years after the partition of Pakistan after his resignation to the then Prime Minister of Law and Labor Liaquat Ali Khan, citing the alleged anti-hindu bias of the Pakistani administration
 jogendra nath mandal kaa janm birisal jile main hua tha, us samay bengal presidency, british bharat, 1904 main bangladesh kaa janm hua tha
 Little is known of his early years that he belonged to a family in the Namasura community
 Namasudras hindu jati vyavastha ke baahar mana jaataa tha lekin iske bheetar ek sthiti kaa daawa karne ke liye ek andolan shuru kar diya tha
 Mandal began his political career as an independent candidate in the 1937 Indian Provincial Assembly elections
 unhone bakhraganj uttar purv gramin nirvachan kshetra ko bengal vidhaan sabha main ek seat par chunaav ladaa or bhartiya rashtriya congress kii jila samiti ke adhyaksh sarakal kumaar datta ko parajeet kiya
 And was the nephew of Swadeshi leader Ashwini Kumar Dutta
 subhash chandra bose or sharathchandra bose donon ne is samay mandal ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya tha
 When the former was expelled from the Congress in 1940, Mandal joined the Muslim League, the only other important national party, and became a minister in the cabinet of MLA Chief Minister, Hussein Shaheed Suhrawardy
 yah bhi is samay ke aasapaas tha ki mandal or bhimrao abedkar ne anusuchit jati sangh kii bengal shakha kii sthapana kii, jo swayan raajnneetik satta kii ichha rakhte the
 While the Namamuddi community was granted by the Hindu Mahasabha, and the province was dominated by Dalit and Muslim people in politics, Mandal saw the difference between communal matters and political disputes involving the Congress and ML
 jab 1946 main dange fail gaye, to unhone purvi bengal ke chaaron ore yatra kii taaki daliton ko musalamaanon ke khilaaf hinsa main bhaag na lene kaa aagrah kiya
 He argued that the Congress caste is being used as pawns by Hindus in their dispute with ML
 15 agast 1947 ko british bharat ke vibhaajan ke baad, mandal pakistan ke samvidhan sabha ke sadsy or asthaayee adhyaksh bane, or kanoon or shram ke liye nae rajya ke pehle mantri ke rup main seva karne par sahamat ho gaye - sarkaar kaa ucchtam sthaan vaala hindu sadsy 1947 se 1950 tak vah pakistan kii tatkaaleen rajdhani karachi ke bandargah shahar main rahete the
 In 1950, Mandal returned to India after submitting his resignation to the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan, citing anti-hindu bias of the Pakistani administration
 unhone apane istife patr main saamaajik anyaay or gaiyr-muslim alpsankhyakon ke prati pakshpatpurna vyavhaar se sambandhit ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 When Pakistan was formed, lakhs of Dalits migrated to Pakistan, who were confident that Muslims would support them, adopt them
 lekin unke saath kya hua, ise jaananaa jaruri he 
 This shocking truth was written by the Law Minister there
 dalit muslim bhaichaare ke pairokaar mandal ko musalamaano ne diya tha dhokhaa 
 Jogendra Nath Mandal was born in Micekadi in Barisal district, Bengal
 wo ek pichhadi jati se aate the, inaki mata kaa naam sandhya or pitaaji kaa naam ramadayal mandal tha 
 Jogendranath Mandal had 6 siblings, of whom he was the youngest

 In 1937, he was nominated for the District Council
 isi varsh unhen bengal legislative counsil kaa sadsy chunaa gaya 
 By 1939,40, he came close to the top leadership of the Congress but soon realized that the Congress had no desire to do much for its own society
 iske baad wo muslim lig se jud gayi 
 Jogendra Nath Mandal was one of the special members of the Muslim League
 1946 main chunaav ke britishraj main antim sarkaar bani to congress or muslim lig donon ne apane pratinidhiyon ko chunaa jo ki mantri ke taur par sarkaar main kaam karenge 
 The Muslim League sent the name of Jogendra Nath Mandal
 pakistan nirmaan ke baad mandal ko kanoon or shram mantri banaaya gaya 
 Jinnah had faith in Jogendra Nath Mandal
 wo mohammad ali jinna ke kaaphi kareebi the 
 In fact, Jogendra, by his own strength, merged Assam's Sylhet into Pakistan
 3 june 1947 kii ghoshnaa ke baad assam ke sayalhet ko janamat sangrah se yah tay karnaa tha ki wo pakistan kaa hissaa banegaa yaa bharat kaa 
 The number of Hindu Muslims in that area was equal
 jinna ne ilaake main mandal ko bheja, mandal ne vahaan daliton kaa mat pakistan ke paksh main jhukaa diya jiske baad sayalhet pakistan kaa hissaa bana aaj wo bangladesh main hai 
 Shortly after the creation of Pakistan, non-muslims were targeted
 hinduo ke saath luutmaar, balaatkaar kii ghatnaayen saamne aane lagi 
 Mandal wrote several letters to the government on this subject, but the government did not listen to them
 jogendra nath mandal ko baahar karne ke liye unki deshbhakti par andeh kiya jane laga 
 Mandal realized that the Pakistan which he considered his home was not worth living for him
 mandal bahut aahaat hue, unhen vishwaas tha pakistan main daliton ke saath anyaay nahin hoga 
 Within about two years, the mandal of Dalit Muslim unity broke

 Socialist democratic party can refer to: svachhndathawad kala, sahitya tathaa bauddhik kshetra kaa ek aandolan tha jo europe main attharahavin shatabdi ke ant main armbh hua
 In the period from 1800 to 1850, this movement was at its peak

 Rousseau's long novel work Julie or the New Heloise, published in 1761, and his autobiographical Confessions, a unique exploration of his own life, is an example of this great thinker's romanticist outlook

 svachhndathawad ke hi prabhaav main german darshanik harder ne apane vishisht romantic neshanalizam kii sankalpana kii
 These inspirations moved herders towards non-european cultures and saw them as structures full of their own specific privacy, legitimacy, and meanings rather than primitive pre-stages of European civilization
 german darshanikon main arthur shoppenhor ko svachhndathawad kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he
 He reinterpreted Kant's intellectual ethics, ignoring his knowledge-epistemology and aesthetics

 The first coherent expression of Romanticism in modern Hindi literature is regarded as Chhayavism
 apane prabhaavshaalee raajnneetik or darshanik taatparyon ke alaava svachhndathawad kii ek bahut badi uplabdhi clasical bhashaaon ko rachanashiltaa ke centre se visthapit karke janpriya bhashaaon main lekhan kii shuruyaat karne se judi he

 lekin svachhndathawad ne is parampara kaa ulanghan karne kii zamin banaayi or pehle francisi or phir angrezi main lekhan karne kaa aagrah balwati hua
 The Romanticist creators, with a renewed emphasis on sentiments, repulsed the classic aristocracy in creativity

 The second important achievement of Romanticism is seen as a rebellion against the rationalism alleged by the European Enlightenment
 gyanoday ke vichaarak prakruti ko tark-buddhi or vyavasthamoolak kram ke udgam ke taur par dekhte the
 This is the extreme expression of mechanics promoted by Newton
 lekin svachhndathawadiyon ne prakruti ko angik vikaas or vividhta ke strot ke rup main grahan kiya
 They were not prepared to consider the natural and the supernatural separately

 The attitude of the Romanticists to the idea of enlightenment was quite problematic
 ve prakruti ko bhavapravan or aadhyatmik shakti ke aadim pravaah ke rup main dekhne ke liye taiyaar nahin ho sakate the

 The role of Friedrich and August Wilhelm von Schlegel is notable in the development of Romanticism
 attharahavin or unnisvin sadi ke sandhikaal par sakriy in vichaarkon kaa kahana tha ki romani sahitya or kala kaa swabhaav taral or khandit he
 Therefore, that ambition to achieve wellness and fulfillment is not in him which is the main feature of classical literature and art
 jo romani he vah vyakhya kii samasyaon se grast rahegaa hi
 According to Schlegel, the works of art refuse to be 100 percent comprehensible on the ground of understanding
 august shlegal ne romani vidmbana kii thisis kaa pratipaadan karte hue kavita kii virodhabhasi prakruti ko rekhaankit kiya
 This meant that it is the nature of poetry not to accomplish any objective or definitive meaning
 svachhndathawadiyon ne shakespeare kii saraahna isliye kii ki unamem apane naatakon ke paatro ke prati ek vidmbanaatmak virakti he
 That is why they have become successful figures of contradictory situations and postures and hence their plays do not denote in favor of any one approach

 According to Dr
 Amarnath, the creator of the technical terminology of Hindi criticism, the mention of Romanticism in Hindi is first found in the history of Hindi literature by Ramchandra Shukla's famous treatise, where he has described Sridhar Pathak as the originator of Romanticism
 amarnath ke anusaar chhayavaad or svachhndathawad main gaharaa samya he
 Both have visions of nature-love, human outlook, self-expression, mystification, personal love expression, paranoia towards ancient culture, symbol-planning, despair, exodus, sublimation of ego, etc
 swachhandathawad yaa romani kaal ek jatil, saahitiyik or bauddhik aandolan he jo 18veen shatabdi ke duusare uttarardh main europe main shuru hua or audyogic kranti kii pratikriya ke rup main or adhik shashakt hua

 This movement recognized strong emotions as the real source of aesthetic experience, with renewed emphasis on emotions such as panic, fear and terror, and awe - especially those emotions that are experienced in the face of sublime nature and its sublime qualities
 , Which are both new aesthetic categories
 isane lok kala or kuch uttam karne kii pracheen reeti, jo ki sahajata ke aichhik gun se yukt he ko aage badhaaya or prakruti dwaara bhashaa avan prachlit prayogon ke rup main anukulit maanav gatividhiyon kii ek "prakritik" gyaan mimasaa ke paksh main tark kiya
 To rise to the level of revivalist medievalism and elements of art and history, which are authentically considered medieval, went beyond the idealized models of libertarianism, rationalism and antiquarianism, from the limits of population growth, urban disorder and industrialism
 In an attempt to escape and it used its imaginations to flee and imagine further, foreigner, unfamiliarity And welcomed more authentic sources of remote and Rococo Cinoyiseri in terms of the medium
 ek romani charitra kaa aadhunik paryaay byran ke gunwan, yaa shaayad galat samaj liye gaye ekanki vyakti, kii kalpana ke anusaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki taatkaalik samaaj ke reeti-rivaaz kii jagah apni rachanaatmak preranaon ke aadesh ko sunata he
 Although the roots of this movement have developed from the German movement Sturm and Dreng, which values instincts and emotions as enlightenment rationalization, the French Revolution laid the foundations of ideals and events that set the backdrop for scholasticism and counter-enlightenment
 audyogic kranti kii parisimaaon kaa bhi swachhandathawad par prabhaav padaa, jo ek prakaar se aadhunik vaastaviktaaon se palaayan tha; vastav main, 19 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main "yatharthwaad" ko swachhandathawad ke dhruviya vipareet ke rup main prastut kiya gaya

 It gave legitimacy to the imagination of a particular individual as a specific influence that allowed liberation from the expressions of ideas of ancient form in art
 vah aitihaasik or prakritik anivaaryta kaa ek shashakt avlamb tha or apane vichaaron ke pratinidhitiv main ek yugachetana 
 Fundamentally, the term "romanticism" was used to refer to some specific artists, poets, writers, musicians, as well as political, philosophical and social thinkers of the late 18th and early 19th centuries
 iskaa prayog saamaan rup se us yug ke anekon kala sambandhi, bauddhik or saamaajik chalanon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa tha
 Even after such general usage of the term, a brief description of Romanticism has been a subject of controversy throughout the 20th century in the areas of intellectual history and literary history and no specific measures could be obtained to agree on it
 arthur lavajoy ne apane history of idias ke nibandhon ke moulik lekh "on da discrimination of romentisism" main is samasya kii jatilta ko vyakt karne kaa prayaas kiya he; kuch vidwaan swachhandathawad ko vartmaan ke saath anivaary rup se satat maanate hai, kuch isamen aadhuniktaa ke praarambhik lakshanon ko dekhte hai, kuch ise gyanoday tarkwaad- gyanoday kaa vipareet, ke virodh kii parampara ke shuruyaat ke rup main dekhte hai or phir bhi kuch anya ise francisi kranti ke sidhe parinaam ke rup main dekhte hai
 An early definition that was given by Charles Boudlier: "in short, autonomy is neither situated in the choice of subject nor in the real truth, but rather it is a way of experience
" kai buddhijivi itihaaskaar swachhandathawad ko prati gyanoday ke mukhya aandolan ke rup main dekhte hai, joki gyanoday kaal ke virodh main ek pratikriya he
 While Enlightenment thinkers emphasized the superiority of deductive causes, Romanticism emphasized experience, imagination and emotion to the extent that some of its thinkers were also accused of being irrational
 haalaanki jab shabd "swachhandathawad" kaa prayog sangeet ke sambandh main kiya gaya vah samay takreeban 1820 se 1900 kaa tha, sangeet ke liye 'romani' shabd kaa samakaleen prayog is aadhunik spashtikaran se mail nahin khaataa tha

 Hoffman named Mozart, Hayden, and Beethoven three "romani composers" and Ludwig Sphor used the words "good romantic style" to refer to parts of Beethoven's fifth symphony
 vaastaviktaa main mozart or heden pracheen sangeetkaar maane jate hai or adhikansh tathyon ke aadhaar par bithoven sangitamay romani yug kii shuruyaat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Beginning around the 19th century, the idea of a planned gap in the music's past resulted in the 19th century being distinguished as the "romani period", and the same encyclopaedia of music also uses these words

 In contemporary music culture, Romani composers chose music as a mass occupation, keeping in mind the sensitive middle class audience in place of typical patrons, unlike ancient composers

 Hoffman himself, who practiced both music and literature, encouraged music as a 'programmatic' or descriptive gesture, an idea that found new audiences extremely appealing

 naatyashaastra main bharat muni ne ras kii vyakhya karte huye kaha he - That is, the combination of passion, feeling, adulterous feeling results in the conclusion of the juice
 suprasiddh sahitya darpan main kaha gaya he hriday kaa sthaayee bhav, jab vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav kaa sanyog praapt kar letaa he to ras rup main nishpann ho jaataa he
 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 They are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way
 ye itane samarth hote hai ki anya bhaavon ko apane main villin kar lete hai
 Their number is 11 - Rati, Haas, mourning, ecstasy, anger, fear, jugupsa, amazement, Nirveda, Vatsalata and love for God
 vibhaav kaa arth he kaaran
 They affect / express the permanent expressions, making them tasty
 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai
 There are two differences of influence: bhaavon kaa udgam jis mukhya bhav yaa vastu ke kaaran ho vah kavy kaa alamban kaha jaataa he
 Subjects and shelter come under suspension
 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he
 In literature, this topic is called Alamban Vibhava or 'alamban'
 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and resort to the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse
 And do
 sanyog kii anek paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par use aganeya maanakar use keval aashray bhed se nayakaarabdh, nayikaarabdh athwa ubhayaarabdh, prakaashan ke vichaar se prachhann tathaa prakaash yaa spasht or gupt tathaa prakashanprakaar ke vichaar se sankshipt, sankeern, sampannatar tathaa samrudhimaan naamak bhed kiye jate hai tathaa vipralambh ke purvanurag yaa abhilashahetuk, maan yaa ishryahetuk, pravaas, virah tathaa karun prilambh naamak bhed kiye gaye hai
 The antithesis of "poetry poetry" is new and the shapahutak distinction can only be accepted as a form of migration, "sahityadarpan" envisages the Karuna Vipralambha
 purvanurag kaaran kii drushti se gunshravan, pratyakshdarshan, chitradarshan, swapn tathaa indrajaal-darshan-janya evam raag sthirataa or chamak ke aadhaar par neeli, kusumbh tathaa manjistha naamak bhedon main baanta jaataa he
 In "alankarakoustubh", the soon-to-be-destroyed and not-so-beautiful raga is called the fourth by the name "haridra", which his commentator also calls "shyamarag"
 purvanurag kaa dash kaamadshaayen - abhilash, chintaa, anusmriti, gunakirthan, udvaig, vilaap, vyaadhi, jadta tathaa maran - maani gai hai, jinke sthaan par kahin apane tathaa kahin duusare ke mat ke rup main vishnudharmotarpurana, dasharupak kii avlok tikaa, sahityadarpan, prataparudriya tathaa saraswatikanthabharan tathaa kavyadarpan main kinchit parivartan ke saath chakshupriti, man:sang, samaran, nidrabhang, tanuta, vyavriti, lajjanaash, unmaad, muchrcha tathaa maran kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 By adding Sharadatanaya, desire and yearning, and Vidyanatha, his number is considered 12 by bringing resolution in place of remembrance and increasing delirium and beauty
 yah yuktiyukt nahin he or inkaa antarbhaav ho saktaa he
 There are two types of mana-vipralambha pranay and jealousy and three types in the name of small, medium and guru, in the name of stability of mana and severity of crime, three types in the name of prabhuvipralambha karaj, shapaj, sambhramaj and yasyataprasa of work or The future Gachpatravas or present and Gatpravaras or the future Gachpatravas or the present and Gatpravaras or Bhootravaras, the tadrupas and forms of Shapaj, and a variety of reasons Nbramj of violence, weather, divine, man, and Prckradi distinction is
 virah gurujanadi kii sameeptha ke kaaran paas rahakar bhi nayika tathaa nayak ke sanyog ke hone kaa tathaa karun vipralambh mrityu ke ananthar bhi punerjeevan dwaara milan kii aashaa bani rahanevaale viyog ko kehete hai
 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa
 ek udhaaharan he- Similarly, the example of Shringar Rasa divided into two parts by the name of Sanyog and Vipralambha or Vioga- hasyaras ke vibhavbhed se aatmasth tathaa parastha evam hasya ke vikasvichaar se smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, apasit tathaa atihasit bhed karke unke bhi uttam, madhyam tathaa adham prakruti bhed se teen bhed karte hue unke antargat purvokt kramash: do-do bhedon ko rakhaa gaya he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas
 angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet
 keval rudrabhatt ne avashya vairaygy, doshanigrah, santosh tathaa tatvasaakshaatkaar naam se iske chaar bhed die hai jo saadhan maatr ke naam he or inaki sankhya badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance
 saath hi nirved, glani, chintaa, autsukya, aaveg, moh, shram, bhay, vishaad, dainya, vyaadhi, jadta, unmaad, apsmaar, traas, aalasy, maran, stambh, vepathu, vevarnya, ashru, swarbhed aadi kii vyabhichaari yaa sanchari bhav ke rup main pariganit kiya he
 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa
 sanskrit ke granthon main ‘mahabharat’ tathaa ‘vircharit’, ‘venisanhaar’ ityadi naatakon main raudra ras kii prabhoot abhivyakti hui he
 Examples - shringaar, raudra tathaa vibhats ke saath viraras ko bhi bharat muni ne mul rason main pariganit kiya he
 The origin of the amazing juice has been revealed from Veer Ras
 vir ras kaa 'varna' 'swarna' athwa 'gaur' tathaa devtaa indra kahe gayi hai
 It is associated with good nature and its abiding spirit is 'enthusiasm'
 vir ras ke keval yudhvir, dharmaveer, dayavir tathaa daanveer bhed sweekaar kiye jate hai
 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj
 vaishnav acharya iske drusht, shrut, sankirtit tathaa anumit naamak bhed karte hai
 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 After this, Rahim won wars in Gujarat, Kumbhalner, Udaipur etc
 is par akbar ne apane samay kii sarvocch oopaadhi 'miorj' se rahim ko vibhooshit kiya
 In 1584, Akbar honored Rahim with the title of khan-e-khana

 Widow Sultana Begum, along with some of her servants, escaped to Ahmedabad
 akbar ko ghatana ke bare main jaise hi maaloom hua, unhone sultanaa begum ko darbar waapas aane kaa sandesh bhej diya
 After getting the message on the way, Begum entered Akbar's court

 rahim ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah dharm se musalmaan or samskruti se shuddh bhartiya the
 After the abolition of Rahim's education, Emperor Akbar, while following the tradition of his father Humayun, got Rahim married to Mahaban, sister of Mirza Aziz Koka, Bairam Khan's adversary
 is vivaah main bhi akbar ne vahi kiya, jo pehle karata rahaa tha ki vivaah ke sambandhon ke badaulat aapasi tanaav va puraani se puraani katutaa ko samaapt kar diya karata tha
 Because of Rahim's wedding Beram Kha and Mirza's ongoing estrangement is finished
 rahim kaa vivaah lagbhag solah saal kii umr main kar diya gaya tha
 One of the principal posts to Akbar's court was the post of Mir Arj

 After much effort and blessings, Akbar could get a boy, whom he named Salim, with the blessings of Sheikh Salim Chishti

 For the creation of a suitable place, it is first necessary to consider some of the fundamental elements of city planning such as roads and streets, squares, squares etc
, minor elements related to buildings, shops, lighthouses, telephone brackets and signposts etc
 Horizontal and vertical views of cities and buildings should be given due consideration
 inke atirikt sthalavinyas kaa safal aakalp chaar baton par nirbhar he : samaavaran, anurupata yaa pratikulata, vismay or jal kaa upyog
 All these together with the original and minor elements provide the appropriate basis for such excellent landscape design, in which a constantly changing scene has to be preconceived
 padap saamagree ke upyog ke vishay main yah aavashyak he ki nagar, uske pados or paryaavaran ke liye saundarya evam upyogita se purna abhikalp taiyaar kiya jaae
 For this purpose a plantation plan should be made
 is sambandh main maarg-parshv-vrikshavali kaa mukhya prayojan chaaya pradaan karnaa tathaa vithi drishy ko susajjit karnaa he
 For this, an attractive tapestry of colorful flowers should be maintained throughout the year
 By applying dark yellow amalatus with the contrast of the flowers of Sinduri gulmohar, the beautiful tree can be prepared and the blue flowers of the Jacaranda mimacifolia will also make the scene more beautiful

 nivaskshetron ke aas paas sajaavati phulonvale vriksh lagaana upyukt he, jaise kadamb, maulashree, kachnaar, kupikurch, sheer chanpak, parijaat, sita, ashok or majun
 To make the park beautiful throughout the year, cana, ornamental ignora, indigo painter and perennial ginia are more suitable than seasonal flowers blooming for two months
 inke saath saath naarangi rang ke dilli gulab or abhisundara lataayen laga dene se varsh bhar sundar laganevaala adbhut vinyas taiyaar hota he, jisaki anurakshan laagat bahut kam hoti he
 Seasonal flowers can be further enhanced in the configuration

 As far as habitats are concerned, three horticultural distinctions can be made: fruit-garden-garden, flower-garden and picturesque gardening
 bagwani ke tisare prakaar kaa uddeshy shobhaa, saundarya yaa vividhta purna drishyon se kalpana ko santusht karnaa he
 The ancient opinion in this regard was that there should be a garden around the house, so that there would be a definite separation in nature and structure
 yah vibhaajan atyant anamy tha or jalwaayu ke anusaar keval itnaa hi vikalp tha ki chaahe koi chat ke neeche deevaaron se ghira rahe or chaahe khule udyaan main prakruti ke bich rahe
 Instead, the gardens built in the depths of China and Japan are good in that they have a view as well as an inclination, which gives solitude and enjoyment
 kintu aadhunik pravriti bagichaa bheetar laane kii he, jisase bheetar or baahar ke bich vibhaajan kii yojana ke sabhi puraane prayaason se utkrisht he, kyonki isse ghar ke bheetar rahen yaa baahar, prakruti kii upasthiti ke kaaran anand, ullas or shant manobhaav avichhinn rahete hai
 In this type of plan, plants like the Queen of the Night, Rukmini, Harsingar should be kept from where the wind comes, so that the aroma can be reached in the building
 bheetar kii ore mani padap, shatavari aadi, aise hi paudhon ke gamale darshanatosh ke liye lagaae ja sakate hai
 But landscape architecture has a special inclination towards gardening, which is the fundamental science of all emergent materials, and the inherent parts of landscape-building that satisfy human emotional cravings in specific types of environment, along with natural shapes
 Are dependent on horticultural skills
 vahaan ghoomane phiranevaale prayek vyakti ke or udhar janevaali prayek aankh ke, saamne vividh drishyon kii shrikhala pradarshit karanevaala ek chitrapatal sa khul jaataa he
 In this way, the value of the approach, scene and location of the place increases by finding a place of exploration and amazement
 jab kabhi maanavkrut or prakritik ghatak krishya kshetron yaa aadyogit kendron ke nikat chaturata ke saath jamaa die jate hai, tab yah maan liya jaataa he ki vah prakruti se mail khaataa hoga
 These efforts bring nature back to the cities in the form of pure air, sunshine, water, greenery, breeze and energizing gardens and parks

 Jaitpal, another king who ruled over Kherla, is mentioned to have read that it was said that he had a Paras stone which he used to make iron into gold
 is raja ke kaarykaal main tex lagaan na chukaane vaale kisaano ke lohe se bane sabhi upyogi saamaan jaise gaichi, sabbal, kulhadi, fawda tak kurk kar letaa tha jise vah baad main paras pathar se sona bana kar apane khajaane main rakhata tha
 Due to the immense gold, people gave this fort the form of ruins today
 raja ke paas paras pathar hone kaa khamiyaja use kai baar bhogana padaa kyoki har koi pratidghandi shaasha us kile par chadhaai sirf paras pathar ko paane ke liye hi karata tha
 In the only oriental Maratha Vivek Sindhu of Marathi, many stories of the Kherla dynasty have been written by Mukundraj Swami, the author of this book
 ek janashruti ke anusaar baar -baar akraman or ladaai - markat se pareshaan hokar ant samay main raja jaitpal ne mughalo ke paas vah anmol paras pathar na chalaa jaye is dar se paras pathar ko bachaane ke liye use is kile se thik saamne uske dghaara banawaaye gayi ravanwari ke talab main phek diya tha
 After the Mughals, when the British rule came and he also came to know that the king of this fort had a stone stone in the pond of Ravanwadi, then he also tried his best to get it, in which the British put iron in the feet of elephants around the pond of Ravanwadi
 It is also heard to tie the sakal-chain and turn it around the pond and that the only iron chain-sakal becomes gold

 As such, the forts of many kings and emperors of our country are full of abundant treasures accumulated by them
 According to the world famous historian Tolmi, the Betul of the present period was the focal point of Akhand Bharat of yesterday
 is baitool main isa pashchaat 130 se 161 kondali naamak raja kaa kabja tha jo ki apane aapako gaund jati kaa maanata tha
 Betul district, which is called the focal point of this Akhand Bharat, was ruled by several generations of Gond kings and emperors
 mughalo ke akraman ke pashchaat hi 35 pargano vaale kherala rajvansh ke kile ko mughalo ne apane anishchit hamalo ke baad hue samjhaute ke tahat uskaa naam badal kar use nayaa naam mehamudabad kar diya 
 Situated at a distance of about ten km from Betul district headquarters, Khedla Fort, which is called a heritage of historical importance, is still in a dilapidated state
 khandahar main tabdeel ho chuke is kile kii deevaaron ke bejaan pathar aaj bhi apane saath hue barbarta purvak vyavhaar ko cheekh-chikhakar gujarey itihaas kii gaatha ko taaja kar yahan par aane- jane waalo ko ek pal ke liye stabdh kar dete he
 Many stories are heard about this fort having inscribed its golden name on the pages of history
 aaj bhi yahi kisse kahaniyaan in kilo ke hisso main khudaai kaa kaaran banate chale ja rahe he
 The fort of Khedla located near Ravanwadi alias Khedla village, located just ten km from Betul district headquarters, has been excavated several times
 ek kivdanti ke anusaar kile ke saamne 22 hectares kii bhoomi par bana baitool jile kaa sabase bada talab jisamen ek sone kaa surya mandir dhansa hua he
 This temple has been excavated many times, but due to the sunken temple in the beach pond, no one has been able to completely remove thousands of tons of soil debris from all around
 is mandir ko lekar aasapaas ke logo main prachlit ek adhanvishwaas ke anusaar mandir ke liye mandir kii khudaai karne vaale ko uske sapane main yah maang kii jaati he ki vah agar mandir main chupe khajaane ko paanaa chahta he to use sabase pahalen apane pehle putr evam pehali putravadhu kii narbali deni hogi 
 aaj yahi kaaran he ki mandir tak koi bhi pahanch paane main safal nahin ho sakaa he
 The second truth is that today, the person whose so-called family wealth has been built, this year, the village panchayat has dug up and put hundreds of tectors in the fields of the earthen people, which are giving full yield to these people today
 ek anya kisse ke mutabik raja jaitpal kii nagari main ek baar bahut jamkar akaal padaa

 Then some saint passed by
 The king paid attention to him and asked him the remedy for the diagnosis of drought and famine spread in the state
 Pleased with the hospitality of King Il, Mahatma asked King Il to get the pond dug on 22 acres of land right in front of his kiln and after digging that pond, the temple of Lord Bholenath was built in the middle of that pond and the establishment of its Paras Shivling
 Do his first worship with his first son and son bride, as well as to reduce the temperature of the sun, he will have to build a grand gold temple of Lord Surya if he does so
 So there will never be a shortage of water in his kingdom and in this pond
 According to the lesson of Mahatma, when the king sent his son and bride to worship after the establishment of the temple, then the worship of the son and the bride was not complete, that the place was completely submerged and the king and his son and bride were in that water The waters melted
 raja il ke putr evam vadhu kii jal samadhi ke baad se lekar aaj tak yahaan kabhi pani kii kami logon ko mahasoos nahin hoti hai
 According to another legend, King Il had the miraculous Paras stone given to him by a Mahatma when he was pleased with the service
 saath hi iskaa durupyog karne kaa manaa kiya tha
 Today, the tax which is taken in rupees in the business of money is used in the era of Raja Il, which used to be iron-clad, was taken in lieu of tax
 ise vishaal taake main jamaa kar raja il is chamatkaarik paras pathar se chuaate the, tab vah lohe ke tukade sone main badal jate the
 This work was done completely in secret
 yah rahasy raja ke marane ke baad hi aam ho paaya tha
 History books also mention this
 saath hi yah ullekh bhi he ki jab raja kaa sir cat gaya tha phir bhi vah bheeshan yudgh kar rahe the
 At that time, a queen of the king did not take away the priceless Paras stone near her and threw it in a large pond situated about 1
5 km from the palace, for fear of it
 is talab main khedla ke raja dwaara mughalo se akraman ke pashchaat uske paas maujuud amuly paras mani ko phekane kii ek katha ne gore agrenzo tak ko vichlit kar diya tha
 It is said that by tying iron reinforcements on the legs of four elephants, they were rotated all around the pond, out of which the rumor of only one sakal being iron was made of gold, many times people in this pond Has been forced to dig
 jila mukhyalay baitool se lagbhag das kimi dur sthit talab ke paas kalantar main jo aabaadi rahi thi vahi aabaadi aaj ravanwari gram ke naam se jaani jaati he
