 scotland ke itihaaskaar thomas carlile kaa maananaa he ki itihaas main ab tak hue lakhon yudhon or ladaaiyon main karodon khabbu, apane khabbu hone ki vajah se maare ja chuke hai
 The reason for this is that the combination of attack and defense is not compatible with them
 darasal, maanav sharir main hriday baayin taraf hota he, jo mahatvapurn ang hone ke saath saath najuk bhi he
 To protect this heart, a shield is placed in the left hand and a sword or a sword in the right hand for fast attack
 ab agar vamahast apane daaen haath main dhaal rakhen, to baayin or sthit hriday kon khatre main daalenge or yadi baayein haath main dhaal rakhen, to daahine haath se talwaar puri kushalta se nahin chalaa paaenge
 That is, both the situations have been fatal for them
 agar aap khabbu ho to aap atheletiks yani ki vyaayaam main behatar kar sakate ho
 Even in a sport like baseball, khubba do better than those who work with the right hand
 mukhya taur par khabbu ucch buddhi ke paae jate hai
 One of the most well-known examples of this is that 20 percent of the Mensa members are children
 bahine haath se kaam karne waalon ko pani ke neeche dekhne main koi khaas mushkil nahin aati
 So they can easily see under water
 khabbu ek saath kai tarah ke kaam karne main sakasham hote hai
 His brain signals very fast

 Morphig is a technique for editing pictures
 isamen ek hi chitra ko kai tareeke se yaa do or do se adhik chitron ko ek saath milakar use behatar yaa alag rup diya jaataa he
 This work is done so subtly that later the viewer does not even realize that the two pictures have been made by mixing
 morphig kaa prayog chalchitron main pehle se hota aa rahaa tha, lekin 1990 ke dashak main computer aane ke baad iskaa adhik prayog dikhne laga he
 Today, this technology has become an important part of movies, advertising and media
 aarambh main morphig do chitron ko cross-fed ke rup main hoti thi, jisamen camera ek chehre yaa vastu par padane ke baad dhire dhire use dhundhala karata jaataa tha or baad main kisi duusari vastu yaa chehre par aakar ruk jaataa tha
 Later, the face or object was completely blurred
 jaise jaise chalchitr-sampadan takneekein digital hoti gai, morphig pehle se behatar hone lagi
 Now morphing is also coming in some advanced mobile phone devices
 chalchitr se jude logon ke alaava aam log bhi computer par is takanic kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 An example of this is that, based on the old picture of a lost person, a picture of his present condition can be made through morphing
 iske alaava morphig dwaara ye bhi dekha yaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, ki kisi vishesh bal-sanvaar, wig, chashma, yaa kisi anya kritrim vastu ke prayog, kisi chot lagane par cheharaa bigadane aadi kii sthit main vah vyakti kaisaa dikhegaa
 This technique is used in the film industry as well as commercial advertisements

 It ruled India for 137 years
 isaki sthapana kaa shrey chandragupta maury or uske mantri kautilya ko diya jaataa he, jinhone nand vansh ke samraat ghananand jo ki chandragupta maury ke shotele bhai ko parajeet kiya
 The credit of expanding and strengthening the Mauryan Empire goes to Emperor Ashoka
 yah samrajya purv main magadh rajya main ganga nadi ke maidaanon se shuru hua
 Its capital was Pataliputra
 chandragupta maury ne 322 isa purv main is samrajya kii sthapana kii or teji se pashchim kii taraf apana samrajya kaa vikaas kiya
 He took advantage of the differences of several small regional states which were born after the invasion of Alexander
 316 isa purv tak maury vansh ne puure uttari pashchimi bharat par adhikaar kar liya tha
 The Maurya dynasty greatly expanded in the kingdom of Chakravarti Emperor Ashoka
 samraat ashok ke kaaran hi maury samrajya sabase mahaan evam shaktishaalee banakar vishvabhar main prasiddh hua
 In 325 BCE, northwestern India was ruled by the satrap of Sikandar
 jab sikandar punjab par chadhaai kar rahaa tha to ek brahman jiskaa naam chanakya tha magadh ko samrajya vistaar ke liye protsaahit karne aayaa
 At that time, Magadha was quite powerful and pricked the eyes of its neighboring states
 par tatkaaleen magadh ke samraat ghananand ne usko thukraa diya
 He said that you are a pundit and take care of your peak "war is the king's job, you are a pundit, only do panditai"
 Since then Chanakya took a vow that he would teach Dhanananda a lesson
 maury pracheen kshatriya kabeeley ke hisse rahe he
 According to Greek sources such as Brahmin literature, Visakhadatta Mudrarakshas and Justin, etc
, there were no opinions of historians about the origin of Maurya
 Some scholars also believe that Chandragupta Maurya has originated from his mother Mura
 Maurya is, they were the clan that followed the peacocks
 parantu yah bhi sateek nahi baithta bhartiya itihaas main yah pehali baar hua mata ke naam se putr kaa vansh chalaa ho maury ek shaktishaalee vansh tha vah unke pita se viraasat main mili thi putr kaa naam pita se hi judaa hota he, unki utpatti vrushal vansh se huyi thi, lekin iskaa koi bhi pramaan itihaas main uplabdh nahin he yah keval tark he kuki ajtak itihaas main kisi ne bhi apane vansh kaa naam mata ke naam se nahin rakhaa, to kuch itihaaskaaro kaa yah sirf anumaan he
 
 chandragupta usee gana pramukh kaa putr tha jo kii chandragupta ke bal avasthaa main hi yoddha ke rup main maaraa gaya
 Chandragupta had the natural qualities to become a king ', seeing this ability, Chanakya made him his disciple, and laid the foundation of a strong nation which is an ideal till date
 iske baad bharat bhar main jasuson kaa ek jaal sa bicha diya gaya jisase raja ke khilaaf gaddari ityadi kii gupt soochna ekatra karne main kiya jaataa tha - yah bharat main shaayad abhootpurv tha
 Once this happened, he prepared Chandragupta to drive away the Greek satraps
 is kaary main use guptcharon ke vistrut jaal se madad mili
 In the invasion of Magadha, Chanakya provoked civil war in Magadha
 uske guptcharon ne nand ke adhikariyon ko rishwat dekar unhe apane paksh main kar liya
 After this, the Nanda ruler left his post and Chanakya got Vijayashree
 nand ko nirvasit jivan jeena padaa jiske baad uskaa kya hua ye agyaat he
 Chandragupta Maurya also won the public's trust and with this he also got the right to power
 us samay magadh bharat kaa sabase shaktishaalee rajya tha
 After the capture of Magadha, Chandragupta occupied the center of power
 chandragupta ne pashchimi tathaa dakshini bharat par vijay abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 Its information comes from indirect evidence
 rudradaaman ke junagarh shilaalekh main likhaa he ki sinchai ke liye sudarshan jhil par ek band pushyagupt dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Pushyagupta was the provincial governor of Ashoka at that time
 pashchimottar bharat ko unani shashan se mukti dilaane ke baad uskaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 Chandragupta defeated Alexander's commander Seleucus around 305 BC
 greek vivaran is vijay kaa ullekh nahin karte hai par itnaa kehete hai ki chandragupta or celukas ke bich ek sandhi hui thi jiske anusaar celukas ne qandahar, kabul, heraat or baluchistan ke pradesh chandragupta ko de die the
 With this, Chandragupta presented him 500 elephants
 itnaa bhi kaha jaataa he chandragupta ne celukas kii beti se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Seleucus sent Megasthenes to the court of Chandragupta as ambassador
 plutark ke anusaar "sandrokotus us samay tak singhasanarudh ho chukaa tha, usne apane 6,00,000 sainikon kii sena se sampoorn bharat ko rond daalaa or apane adheen kar liya"
