yah ek pathari ilaaka he
 In Arabic, 'najd' means high area and the name was used for many highlands of the Arabic peninsula
 lekin inamen sabase janaa-mana is prayadweep ke bich kaa bhubhag he jiske pashchim main hijaaz or yemen ke pahaad, purv main bahrain kaa aitihaasik ilaaka or uttar main iraq or syria sthit hai
 Medieval Muslim geographers disputed the boundary between the Hijaz and the Najd territories, but this border is generally considered to be where the western mountains and the lava rocks begin to slope eastward
 najd kii purvi sarhad al-dahana registan ke laal retile tilon main maani jaati he jo aadhunik riyadh shahar se 100 kimi purv main hai
 The southern boundary of Najd is believed to be in the desert of Rub al-khali
 najd kii uttari seemaa ko lekar hameshaa matbhed rahaa he
 At the start of Islam, it was considered near the Furat River where the Sasani Empire of Iran built 'khusrau Walls' between Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula while trying to protect their kingdom
 aadhunik prayog main 'al-yamama' kaa kshetra najd kaa hissaa mana jaataa he, haalanki pehle jamaane main yah najd se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The height of the Najd plateau ranges from 700 m to 1,400 m
 is puure pathaar main pashchim se purv kii halaki dhalaan he
 This plateau is composed of frozen lava erupted from volcanoes in the primeval era, with sand collecting from place to place
 iskaa purvi bhaag, jise al-yamama kehete hai, apane andar bahut se nachlistaan samete hue hai jahaan kheti or vyapaar chalata he, jabaki pashchimi bhaag main adhik shushki he or vahaan kanaabadosh baduin log rahete hai
 Some of the main geographical features of Najd are as follows: najd kshetra ke bahut se gaanv-bastiyaan inhi sukhi vaadiyon main based hai kyonki yahan ati-shushk vaataavaran main kabhi-kabhaar padane vaali barish kaa pani inamen bachaaya ja saktaa he 
 Geologists think that these claims are actually paving of the ancient rivers that once flowed across the region but which now, apart from being waterlogged due to occasional heavy rains, remain dry throughout the year
 najd ko aitihaasik rup se praanton main baanta jaataa he
 Every province was a small group of towns, settlements and villages, one of which was the capital
 har praant kaa najdi upbhasha bolne kaa apana alag lahaza hota tha or har praant ke kuch vishesh reeti-rivaaj the
 Some of the famous provinces in these provinces were as follows: aadhunik soudi arab main najd ko punarsangathit karke teen praanton main baanta gaya he: hil, al-qassim or riyadh
 The total area of najd covered in these three provinces is 554,000 sq km
 riyadh najd kaa or puure soudi arab kaa sabase bada shahar he or 2009 main yahan lagbhag 47 lakh log rahete the
 The exclusive right to complete control of power or dominance over a geographical area or group of people is called sovereignty
 saarvbhaum sarvocch vidhi nirmaataa evam niyantrak hota he yani samprabhutaa rajya kii sarvocch shakti he
 The rise of the modern state in Europe resulted in the concept of 'sovereignty' in the seventeenth century
 madhya europe main europee rajshahiyon or samrajyon main satta raja, pope or saamanton ke bich banti rahati thi
 The decline of the recognition of the Catholic Church in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries led to the disintegration of feudalism and the rise of Protestant faith gave sovereign states a chance to flourish
 samprabhutaa kaa matlab he - 'sampoorn or aseemit satta'
 But its implications are not so simple
 mahaz is arth se yah pataa nahin chalata ki akhir is sampoorn satta kii sanrachana main kya-kya shaamil he? kya iskaa matlab kisi sarvocch vaidhanik praadhikaar se hota he yaa phir iskaa sambandh ek aisi raajnneetik satta se he jise chunauti na di ja sake? Due to similar disputes over the meaning of sovereignty, it has been understood since the nineteenth century by dividing it into two parts: legal sovereignty and political sovereignty
 is avadharana ko vyaavhaarik rup se aantarik samprabhutaa or bahya samprabhutaa ke taur par bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The internal version of sovereignty means the division of power within the state, the supreme power within the political system
 bahya sanskaran kaa taatpary he antarrashtriya vyavastha ke tahat rajya dwaara ek swatantra or swytt vajood kii tarah sakriy rah paane kii kshamta kaa pradarshan
 The concept of sovereignty is also rooted in the basis of modern nation and nationalism
 rashtriya swatantraaa, swa-shashan or samprabhutaa ke vichaaron ke mili-jule prabhaav ke bina a-upniveshikaran ke us silsile kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati jiske tahat dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke baad asia, africa or laathini america main bade paimaane par naye rashtron kii rachana hui
 There is an intellectual history of the difference between legal and political sovereignty which has to be looked at to understand the differences between Jean Boaden and Thomas Hobbes
 bodaan ne apni rachana da sicks books of kaamanvil main ek aise samprabhu ke paksh main tark diya he jo khud kanoon banaata he, par swayan ko un kanoonon ke upar rakhata he
 According to this view, law means to run people on the orders of the sovereign
 iskaa matlab yah nahin bodaan yahan kisi nirankush shaasha kii vakaalat karnaa chaahate the
 He believed that the sovereign ruler who made and complied with the law would be subject to a higher law
 yani loukik shaasha ke praadhikaar par daivi kanoon kii muhar zaruri hogi
 Contrary to Bodan's view, Hobbes in his composition Leviathan describes the idea of sovereignty not in terms of authority, but in terms of power
 hobbs se pehle saint augusteen ne ek aise samprabhu kii zarurat par bal diya tha jo maanavtaa main antarnihit naitik buraaiyon ko kaabo main rakhega
 Further developing this logic, Hobbes, while defining sovereignty as a monopoly on the oppressive power, recommended that this power should be in the hands of the ruler alone
 haalaanki hobbs nirbaadh rajshahi ko praathamikta dete the, par ve yah maanane ke liye bhi taiyaar the yah satta shaskaon ke ek chote se gut yaa kisi loktantric sabha ke haath main bhi ho sakati he
 This debate between Bodas and Hobbes suggests that legal sovereignty rests on state law as paramount
 iske vipareet raajnneetik samprabhutaa satta ke vaastavik vitaran se judi hui he
 Despite this difference, one also has to believe that the practical notion of sovereignty has legal aspects as well as political aspects
 aadhunik rajyon kii samprabhutaa kanoon kii sarvoparita par bhi nirbhar he or us kanoon kaa anupaalan karwaane vaale sattamulak tantra par bhi jiske paas damankaaree mashinari hoti he
 No law applies merely on the basis of moral obligations
 dand dene vaali vyavastha, police, jail or adaalaton ke bina use kaayam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This equation of legal and political sovereignty seems to be effective on both sides
 kanoon ko apane anupaalan ke liye agar satta ke tantra kii zarurat he, to satta ko apni vaidhata ke liye kanoon kii sanstuti kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Governance has to be lawful and constitutional, only then its legitimacy is maintained
 keval raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke dam par taanashaah sarkarein hi kaam karti hai
 If the government is democratic then its oppressive machinery has to remain accountable before the courts by staying within the boundaries of law
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik swaroop ke prashn par raajnneetik siddhant ke daayaron main kaafii bahes hui he
 After all, what should be the place of supreme and unlimited power? Would it be better to place it in the hands of one ruler or would it be better to have its center vested in a representative institution? In the seventeenth century, Emperor Louis Fourteenth of France told Darp that i am the kingdom
 ek vyakti ke haath main samprabhutaa dene ke peeche tark yah he ki us surat main samprabhutaa ke avibhajya hone kaa guarantee rahegi
 His expression will be in one voice and no other authority will interfere in it
 samprabhutaa kii is sarvasattavadi dharna main prabhaavshaalee hastkshep attharahavin sadi main kiya gaya jab jyaan-zaak ruso ne lokapriy samprabhutaa kii avadharana pesh kii
 Russo, rejecting the rule of the monarchy, wrote in his composition Social Contract: 'man is born free, but everywhere he is held in chains
 ’ darasal, soshal kantrect aadhunik raajnneetik darshan ko ekadam nayaa rup de detii he
 Their social agreement is different from Hobbes and Locke's social settlement
 ruso se pehle ke darshanikon kaa yakeen tha ki manushya apni buddhigat kshamtaaon ke kaaran duusare praaniyon se bhinn he, jabaki ruso maanate hai ki insaan naitik chunaav kii kshamta ke kaaran alag he
 If he is not given the freedom to make this election, he will be nothing more than a slave
 chunki samaaj tarah-tarah kii a-swatantraaaon se bharaa hua he or manushya apni prakritik swatantraaa ke shuruaati sansar main nahin laut saktaa, isliye ruso tajaviz karte hai ki use apni us azaadi kaa vinimay naagarik swatantraaa se karnaa chahie
 For this, human beings will have to form associations with each other, social existence will be created under which all people will relinquish their rights and in turn get rights as citizens, will remain as members of one sovereign
 arthath ek samvidhan bananaa padegaa jiske tahat har vyakti adheen bhi hoga or sahabhaagi naagarik bhi
 Only this way freedom can be guaranteed
 yah loktantr kii avadharana thi, par ruso janata ke pratinidhiyon dwaara chalaaye jane vaale loktantr yaa vidhi-nirmaan se sahamat nahin the
 Like the direct democracy of ancient Greece, Rousseau wanted all citizens to congregate in a public place and formulate a law
 alpamat ko bahumat dwaara liye gayi nirnay ke adheen hone se bachaane ke liye ruso ne sarvasammati kaa paksh liya jise kargar banane ke liye unhone apane sabase vikhyath siddhant ‘jan-ichha’ kaa sutrikaran kiya
 Following the law created on the basis of 'public will' meant to follow one's own will
 ruso dwaara pravartit ‘jan-ichha’ kaa siddhant aage chal kar aadhunik loktantric siddhant kaa aadhaar bana
 Rousseau envisioned a comfortable community of citizens who would be the bearers of equality and unity beyond high-altitude relations, so he believed that it would be easy to provide 'public will' among them
 lekin ruso kabhi is prashn kaa uttar nahin de paye ki nagarikon kii aam sabha main vyakt kii jane vaali ichchhaaon main se ‘jarnal-vil’ kaise niklegi
 Therefore, in the end, they were seen saying that if 'people's will' is not available, then the will of the majority should be considered synonymous
 samprabhutaa ke siddhant ko udaarataavaadi-loktantric vichaar ke pairokaron ne aade haathon bhi liya he
 He says that the notion of sovereignty is unnecessary in the context of pluralistic and democratic governance
 ye log samprabhutaa ke vichaar ko uske sarvasattavadi ateet se peedit or isliye avaanchhneeya maanate hai
 He says that democratic governments are not run by the allegedly lawful regime imposed by the oppressive machinery
 ve to niyantran or santulan ke sameekaran or uske aadhaar par bane network ke zariye shashan karti hai
 Indeed, in modern states with a federal character, it is very difficult to determine the center of internal sovereignty
 sanyukt rajya america, canada, osterelia or bharat jaise sanghatmak rajyon main sarkaar do staron main vibhajit he or prayek str ke paas apane swytt adhikaar hai
 Sovereignty in such states emerges as a partnership between the center and the periphery
 aisi paristhiti main agar koi avibhajit samprabhu he to vah he samvidhan jo centre ko bhi samprabhutaa sampann banaata he or rajyon ko bhi
 External sovereignty signifies the status of a state in the international system
 is tarah kii paristhitiyaan bhi hoti hai ki kisi rajya main aantarik samprabhutaa par vivaad chalata rahata he, par antarrashtriya kshetra main uski bahya samprabhutaa kaa aadar kiya jaataa he
 Anyway, in the era of democracies, issues of internal sovereignty are no longer considered so important, but the question of external sovereignty has become more important than ever
 aise kai antarrashtriya vivaad hai jinamein ek desh kii samprabhutaa kaa daawa duusare desh kii taraf se apni samprabhutaa ke liye chunauti ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The movement by the Palestinians for their sovereign nation is considered by Israel to be the cause of the decline of its sovereignty

 Rakshabandhan is a predominantly Hindu festival in ancient times
 prativarsh shravan maas kii poornima ke din brahman apane yajmaanon ke daahine haath par ek sutara baandhte the, jise rakshasutra kaha jaataa tha
 It was later that Rakhi started going
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yajna main jo yagyasutra baandha jaataa tha use aage chalakar rakshasutra kaha jane laga
 It is difficult to say when the social popularity of Rakshabandhan started
 kuch puranic kathaon main iskaa zikr he jiske anusaar bhagwaan vishnu ke vaamanavatar ne bhi raja bali ke rakshasutra baandha tha or uske baad hi unhen pataal jane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Even today, while chanting the Raksasutra, a mantra is uttered, this incident is mentioned in it

 rakshasutra kaa mantra he- yen baddho bali raja danvendro mahabal:
 Ten tawmanubadhnami protect walk 
 This mantra is generally taken to mean that Mahabali king Bali of the demons binds you with whom he was tied
 he rakshe! tum chalyman na ho, chalyman na ho
 According to the scholars of theology, this means that while tying the Raksha Sutra, the Brahmin or the priest tells his Yajman that the Raksasutra with which the great king of the demons was sacrificed was tied in the bond of religion, that is, i used the same formula
 i bind you, that is, i commit to religion
 iske baad purohit raksha sutara se kahata he ki he rakshe tum sthir rahanaa, sthir rahanaa
 In this way, the aim of Raksha Sutra is to motivate and use the Brahmins for their religion in religion
 shastron main kaha gaya he - is din aparaanh main rakshasutra kaa pujan kare or uske uparaant rakshabandhan kaa vidhaan he

 arthath is prakaar vidhipurvak jiske rakshabandhan kiya jaataa he vah sampurna dosha se dur rahakar sampurna varsh sukhi rahata he
 There are basically two emotions working in Rakshabandhan
 pratham jis vyakti ke rakshabandhan kiya jaataa he uski kalyaan kaamana or duusare rakshabandhan karne vaale ke prati sneh bhaavana
 Thus Rakshabandhan is actually a bond of affection, peace and protection

 saarvajanik vot jeetne ke baavjood, nitevish ne antat doosraa sthaan paaya, jisamen juri ne sthaneey gospel gayika nina estrom ko finland kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye chunaa
 On 19 May 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album Wishmaster, which debuted at # 1 in the Finnish Albums Chart and was number one for the next three days, earning a Gold Certificate in Finland
 The album received mixed reviews, with Allmusic calling it a recurrence and saying "it's a sad and disappointing experience as a whole album"
 Despite competing with long-awaited contestants Iron Maiden and Bon Jovi, the German magazine Rock Hard declared Wishmaster the "album of the Month"

 However, the other new songs did not receive such a good break-through and were never re-released, with the exception being the live performance of "10th Man Down" with Marco Hietala on the "encyd of Innocence" DVD
 relies ke baad jald hi, nitevish aise halaaton se gujara jise band ke rup main apane sabase kathin halaaton main se ek ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 The problem mostly stemmed from bassist Sami Vanska, who started abusing the band like not coming in at the appointed time and not taking Giggs seriously as the rest did
 vanska ke saath uske vyavhaar ke bare main kai baar band dwaara charchaa kiya gaya, lekin vina kisi parivartan ke har kisi ne chintaa karnaa chhod diya tathaa tanaav main vruddhi hui
 is bich, guitaravadak ampu vorinen ne band main uski bhoomika ke bare main shikaayat shuru kii, use lagata tha ki vah "ek kiraye kaa tattu he jise har kaam karnaa padataa he"
 unke sangeet shikshak plamen dimov ke anusaar, vah or holopanen puri tarah se bhinn vyakti hai or is prakaar kii kathinaaiyaan aane kii ummid jataai gai thi
 But Vorinen was asked to remain calm and "spit angry" and the problem never came again
 isi samay, holopanen ne nitevish ke tuutane ke bare main gambhirtha se sochna shuru kar diya
 rus main ek gig ke baad, unhone apane saathi sangeetkaar metal band {1sonata arctic{ / 1} ke tony kakko sandesh bheja ki unhen nahin lagata ki ab unke paas koi band hoga or unke agle varsh kii yojana ke bare main poocha

 usne unhen bataaya ki vah ek or elbum kaa nirmaan saktaa he, lekin vah band ke saath ek or sho pradarshan kabhi nahin hoga
 yahi sandesh band ke sandesh board par bhi likhaa tha
 Soon after the last gig Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to Lapland with Tony Kakko to feel relieved when he finished Nightwish, but unfortunately it could not
 But something has happened during hiking and although they hardly discussed it alone in the forest, they both also knew that breaking Nightwish is not so easy
 jab vah lapland se laute unhen turant he evo pozola kaa kaa phone aayaa ki ve unke prabandhak bananaa or yah maamla sulajhane main unka madad karnaa chaahate hai
 And Holopainen agreed
 nitevish ko shuru rakhane ke liye holopanen ne kuch parivartan karne kaa nirnay liya
 In addition to choosing Evo as manager, he also decided to ask Sami Vanska to leave the band
 marco hietala ko sinji ko puri tarah chhodkar band main shaamil hone ke liye poocha gaya
 In addition to playing the bass guitar, Hiattala is also a male singer

 haalanki, unhe ek saath koi project banane main dilchaspee nahin he
 In 2002, Nightwish released Century Child with the singles "ever Dream" and "bless the Child"

 It is necessary to know here that "realm" is not a legal or legal term in the official terminology of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or any Commonwealth Territory, that is, there is no legal definition of "realm"
