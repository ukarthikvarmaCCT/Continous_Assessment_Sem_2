 Social movements are large informal groups of individuals and / or organizations focused on a specific social issue
 duusare shabdon main ye ye koi saamaajik parivartan karnaa chaahate hai, uskaa virodh karte hai yaa kisi saamaajik parivartan ko samaapt kar purvasthiti main laana chaahate hai Social movements in the modern western world were made possible by the spread of education and in the nineteenth century due to the increase in labor movement due to industrialization and urbanization
 aadhunik aandolan sansar bhar main logon ko jaagrit karne ke liye praudyogiki tathaa antarjaal kaa sahaara lete hai
 The greatest magnate of India's social movement is Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar
 dow babasaheb ambedkar kaa shaktishaalee saamaajik andolan vishwa ke sabase prabhaavshaalee aandolanon main se ek he tathaa bharat kaa sabase prabhaavshaalee saamaajik andolan he

 Movements that carry out transformative politics outside the institutional spheres of political participation are termed as social movements
 lambe samay tak samuhik raajnneetik karrwai karne vaali ye andolankaaree sanrachanaayen nagar samaaj or raajnneetik tantra ke bich anaupchaarik sutara kaa kaam bhi karti hai
 Although most social movements work against government policy or conduct, spontaneous or unorganized resistance or action is not considered a social movement
 iske liye kisi spasht netritv or ek nirnayakari dhaanche kaa hona zaruri he
 It is also necessary for the participants in the movement to have a common motive and ideology
 kya ye kuubiyaan raajnneeti ke aupchaarik daayaron main kaam karne vaale kisi raajnneetik dal yaa dabaav samooh main nahin hotin? darasal, saamaajik andolan apane buniyadi charitra main anaupchaarik networkon kii anyonyakriya se banate hai
 They choose issues that formal politics refuses to adopt
 saath hi ve pratirodh or golbandi ke gair-paramparaagat roopon kaa istemaal karte hai
 Social movements have promoted the politics of minorities, marginalized groups and rights-deprived sections
 isi kaaran se yah bhi mana jaataa he ki samakaleen loktantr apane vistaar or gaharaai ke liye saamaajik andolanon kaa rini he
 After World War II, this phenomenon arose in global and national political systems
 inke peeche aisi shakhsiyaten, network, samooh or sanghathan the jinka uddeshy aupchaarik raajnneeti ke daayaron ke baahar samaaj, rajya, saarvajanik nitiyon ko jan-hit ke lihaaz se prabhavit karnaa tha
 In the last sixty years, social movements have made a significant impact on political systems and the process of democratization
 sari duniya main paryaavaran kaa andolan, yuddh virdohi andolan, asangathit mazaduron ke andolan, stri-adhikaron ke andolan, vaikalpik youniktaaon ke andolan is parighatna kii safalataa ke pramaan hai
 Movements against the anti-people tendencies arising from the globalization of financial capital also fall in this category
 saamaajik andolanon kii ek kubi yah bhi he ki bhale hi unki raajnneetik karrwai main sthaniyata yaa zamin se jude hone yaa grassroots ke sambandh ko ahmiyat di jaae, lekin ve samasyaon or muddon ko uttarottar global sandarbhon main dekhte or paribhaashit karte hai
 For this reason, they are able to sustain the resistance operations being conducted at the local level through global networking
 unka naaraa hota he ‘think globali, act lokali’
 With the emergence of the phenomenon of the Internet, the facilities for dissemination, coordination and networking for social movements have increased further

 Many social movements in this era were mobilized around urges to oppose civil rights, women's rights, war and to protect the environment

 They also started getting political success
 yah dekh kar samaaj-vaigyanikon ne is parighatna kaa adhyayan shuru kiya
 Psychology was first used to understand social movements
 isse andolnarat logon, samoohon or networkon ke samuhik vyavhaar par roshni padi
 The second method was of the structural-functionalist type
 usne yah dekhne kii koshish kii ki in andolanon kaa saamaajik sthirataa par kya asar pad rahaa he
 Psychologists studying mass society felt that social movements were manifestations of individuals struggling with personal stress
 duusari taraf sanrachanagat-prakaarywaadee vidwaanon kaa khyaal tha ki ye andolan saamaajik pranali main aaye tanaavon kaa falitarth hai
 In the seventies, this research changed new positions
 is parivartan ke peeche naye chaatr andolanon or unase nikali pratirodh kii karravaayiyon kaa prabhaav tha
 a new theory was born which is known as 'resource Mobilization' theory
 is siddhant ne saamaajik andolanon ko ek aisi saamaajik prakriya ke rup main dekha jiske tahat raajnneetik udhyami kisi icchit saamaajik parivartan kii khaatir pehle to sansadhano kaa tarksangat sanchay karte hai or phir lakshyon ko vedhane ke liye sansadhano kaa prayog karte hai
 Advocates of this theory believe that social movements depend solely on their ability to provide resources
 ye sansaadhan aarthik or maanviya sahyog jutaney par bhi aadhaarit ho sakate hai or inkaa udgam naitik sarokaaron or praadhikaar vagairah main bhi ho saktaa he
 In the process of understanding social movements, a theory also developed as a study of organizational behavior
 usne saamaajik andolan ko kisi bhi anya sangathit samooh kii tarah samajhane kii cheshtaa kii
 Later on, many scholars paid special attention to the interaction between social movements and institutional politics which led to the development of the perspective of understanding politics as processes
 assi ke dashak main hue kuch anusandhanon ne vampanthi rujhaan vaale kai andolanon par dhyaan diya
 These leftist groups were supposed to believe in a hierarchical organization rather than hierarchically based organization and alternating leadership or informal leadership

 He saw how the environmental movement and the women's rights movement are using new and unique methods of resistance
 is vimarsh se nav-saamaajik andolanon kii thisis nikali
 Indeed, this thesis that came to light during the eighties and nineties proved to challenge the established understanding of the Left
 isse pehle vampanthi raajnneetik karrwai kaa matlab varg-aadhaarit gatividhi ke alaava kuch or nahin samajha jaataa tha
 However, when afro-americans in the US launched radical and militant movements such as Black Power and Black Panther in support of their rights; When anti-imperialist campaigns were organized against the Vietnam War; When the peace movement waged in favor of adult disarmament; When Radical Feminism presented its contests; And when the voice was raised against the pollution of air and water, the class struggle itself had to be questioned as the central social contradiction
 in andolanon main ek vichaardhaaratmak vividhta thi
 Their land also looked different from each other
 parmparik marxvaadi samaj ko thukaraate hue andre groz, rudolf bahro, elaan turin or yuragan havermas ne apane- apane tareeke se daawa kiya ki saamaajik-raajnneetik asmita or raajnneetik karrwai kii khaatir kii jane vaali golbandi ke liye varg ab ek kargar pratyay nahin rah gaya he
 These scholars termed the neo-social movements as the creation of post-industrial social structures
 unka kahana tha ki lokopkaaree rajya ne shoshan ke puraane roopon ko kaafii-kuch nishprabhavi kar diya he
 Modern society is giving birth to new forms of alienation under new circumstances

 The rise of globalization has created conditions of reconciliation between European and American perspectives on social movement

 Special emphasis is also being given to the association of this phenomenon and the anti-globalization movement

 ye praayah unke dainik jivan ke vibhinn kriyakalapon ke photo lete hai
 In the second half of the twentieth century, a completely new profession of news photographers emerged
 papaaratsi raajnneeti, khel, film yaa kisi bhi vibhaag ke prasiddh vyakti kaa peechha karte hai or unke dainik jivan ke aise tathyon ko apane camere main surakshit kar lete hai jo dekhne waalon ke liye atyaadhik rochak or sansani se bhari ho
 Paparatsy photographer shows are particularly well-known in the world of business as their spy cameras keep their eyes on the stars of the world of art, and it is difficult for those famous artists to spend even a single minute in seclusion
 papaaratsi italvi bhashaa kaa shabd he or iskaa uccharan papaaratsi he
 It was first heard in the 50s when some of Rome's young photographers published some private portraits of Egypt's Shah Farooq

 There was a lot of criticism about the profession of these people when Princess Diana died in an accident
 is car durghatana ke bare main ek vichaar yah tha ki sab papaaratsi photographron kaa kiya dharaa he jo ki rajkumaari dyna or unke premi kii photo lene ke liye shikari kutton kii tarah un kaa peechha kiya karte the
 Originally it is an Italian name and became famous due to just one film
 1960 main prasiddh italvi nirdeshak car federico fleni ne us noujvaan photographer ke jivan par film banane kaa iraadaa kiya jisane sab se pehle ek restraan main shah faruq kii ek aisi photo lee thi jis main vah gusse main aape se baahar dikhaai de rahe the or krodh kii avasthaa main ek mez ulataa rahe the
 The character's name in the film is Coriolano Paparatso
 nirdeshak federico fleni se ek baar poocha gaya ki unhen apane paatr ke liye yah naam soojha kaise to unhone bataaya ki ek angrez paryatak ke puraane safarnaame main ek sarai kii charchaa he jis ke maalik kaa naam papaaratso tha bas vahi naam mere dimaag se chipka hua tha or film main photographer ke paatr ke liye abhinayta marasilo mastriyani kaa chayan kiya gaya to unhen bhi yah naam bahut pasand aayaa
 But at that time both did not know that they have given a new word to the English language

 dakshin desh ke devgiri parvat ke nikat sukarma naamak brahman apni pati parayan patni sudesh ke saath rahata tha
 Both of them were devotees of Shiva but worried about not having children
 patni ke aagrah par uske patni kii bahan ghusma ke saath vivha kiya jo param shiv bhakt thi
 By Shiva's grace he received a son's wealth
 isse sudesh car ishya hone lagi or usne avasar paa kar sout ke bete kii hatya kar di
 By the grace of Lord Shiva, the child rose up and on the request of Ghushma, gave him the boon to live there forever and started living there and the name of that pond, also known as Ghushmeshwar, has since become Shivalaya
 is jyotirling ke vishay main puraanon main yah katha varnit he- dakshin desh main devgiriparvat ke nikat sudharma naamak ek atyant tejasvi taponisht brahman rahata tha
 His wife's name was Sudeha
 The two had a lot of mutual love
 kisi prakaar kaa koi ksht unhen nahin tha
 But he had no child
 jyotish-gananaa se pataa chalaa ki sudeha ke garbh se santanotpatti ho hi nahin sakati
 Sudeha was very keen on children
 usne sudharma se apni choti bahan se doosraa vivaah karne kaa aagrah kiya
 At first Sudharma did not think about this
 lekin ant main unhen patni kii jid ke aage jhukna hi padaa
 They could not defer his request
 ve apni patni kii choti bahan ghushma ko byaah kar ghar le aae
 Ghushma was a very gracious and virtuous woman
 vah bhagavan shiv kii anany bhaktha thi
 She used to worship him with true devotion of heart by making one hundred and one earth shivling every day
 bhagwaan shivaji kii krupa se thode hi din baad uske garbh se atyant sundar or swasth balak ne janm liya
 The birth of the child did not cross the pleasure of both Sudeha and Ghushma
 donon ke din bade aaraam se biit rahe the
 But do not know how soon after a few days a misconception was born in Sudeha's mind
 vah sochane lagi, meraa to is ghar main kuch he nahin
 Everything belongs to Ghushma
 ab tak sudharma ke man kaa kuvichaar rupi ankur ek vishaal vriksh kaa rup le chukaa tha
 Finally one day he killed Ghushma's young son while sleeping at night
 uske shav ko le jaakar usne usee talab main phenk diya jisamen ghushma pratidin parthiv shivlingon ko phenkaa karti thi He also took possession of my husband
 santan bhi usee kii he
 This idea gradually grew in his mind
 idhar ghushma kaa vah balak bhi bada ho rahaa tha
 Gradually he became young
 uskaa vivaah bhi ho gaya
 Everyone came to know about this in the morning
 puure ghar main kuharaam much gaya
 Both Sudharma and his daughter-in-law beat their heads and wept bitterly
 lekin ghushma nity kii bhanti bhagavan shiv kii aradhana main tallin rahi
 As if nothing has happened
 puja samaapt karne ke baad vah parthiv shivlingon ko talab main chhodane ke liye chal padi
 When she started returning from the pond, her beloved Lal was seen coming out of the pond
 vah sadaa kii bhanti aakar ghushma ke charnon par gir padaa
 As if you are walking around from somewhere
 isi samay bhagavan shiv bhi vahaan prakat hokar ghushma se var maangane ko kehane lage
 He was extremely enraged by Sudeha's heavy-handed actions
 apane trishul dwaara uskaa galaa kaatane ko udyat dikhalaai de rahe the
 Ghushma folded his hands and said to Lord Shiva - 'prabhu! If you are happy with me then forgive that unfortunate sister of mine
 nishchit hi usne atyant jaghanya paap kiya he kintu aapaki dayaa se mujhe meraa putr waapas mil gaya
 Now you forgive him and God! meri ek prarthana or he, lok-kalyaan ke liye aap is sthaan par sarvada ke liye nivas karen
 'lord Shiva accepted both of these things
 jyotirling ke rup main prakat hokar vah vahiin nivas karne lage
 He became famous here by the name of Ghushmeshwar Mahadev because Sati Shiva devotee Ghushma was adorable
 ghushmeshwar-jyotirling kii mahima puraanon main bahut vistaar se varnit kii gai he

 vah ye bhi bolta he ki use jo maarane kii koshish kar rahe the, vah unka bhi naam legaa
 On seeing Rohit alive, his killers get scared
 saxena ko yah sachai sonia bataa detii he ki wo rohit nahin raaj he
 Saxena then reveals the truth to Malik and the corrupt officer at the same time
 malik ko lagata he ki saxena un logon ko fansaa rahaa he, kyonki rohit ne saxena ko nahin dekha isliye vah uskaa naam nahin legaa lekin un donon kaa le legaa

 This zand is based on the scripture named Avesta

 Now only a few parts of Zand Avesta are available
 iske sabase puraane bhaag rugveda ke turant baad ke kaal ke ho sakate hai
 Its language is Avestan language, which is very much similar to Sanskrit language
 parsi dharm kii shiksha haih humat, hukht, huvarsht jo sanskrit main sumat, sookt, suvartan athwa subuddhi, subhash, suvyavahaar hua
 Parsis believe in a god called Ahura Mazda

 Parsi temples are called Atish Behram

 Varigod parsi vishwaas ke mutabik ahura mazda kaa dushman dusht angira manyu he
 Zoroastrianism was once the religion of Iran
 unhone hindustan main sharan lee
 Since then, the Zoroastrians have contributed immensely to the rise of India
 pracheen faras jab purvi europe se madhya asia tak failaa ek vishaal samrajya tha, tab paigambar zarathustra ne ek ishwarwad kaa sandesh dete hue parsi dharm kii neenv rakhi

 Everything we know about this history today is due to the inscription and textual tradition engraved in the mountains of Iran
 saatvin sadi isvi tak aate-aate farsi samrajya apana puraatan vaibhav tathaa shakti ganvaa chukaa tha
 When the Arabs won a decisive victory over it, in order to protect their religion, many Zoroastrians fled through the religious sea and took refuge on the west coast of India
 yahan ve 'parsi' kehalaae
 Today, there are only between 125 and 1
5 lakh people in the world
 inamen se aadhe se adhik bharat main hai
 Pangbar Zarathustra traveled far and wide to deliver his message during the reign of the Persian emperor Vishtasp
 unke anusaar ishwar ek hi he 
 Zarathustra called this god 'ahura Mazda' i
e
 'great Life Giver'
 ahura majadaa koi vyakti nahin he, balki satv he, shakti he, urja he
 According to Zarathustra, there is a constant struggle between two primordial souls in the world
 inamen ek he ahura majadaa kii aatma, 'spenta manu'
 The second is the evil spirit 'anghara Menu'
 is dusht aatma ke naash hetu hi ahura majadaa ne apni saat kritiyon yatha akaash, jal, prithvi, vanaspati, pashu, maanav evam agni se is bhautik vishwa kaa srijan kiya
 They knew that due to their destructive nature and ignorance, the Anghara menu would attack this world and would enter into chaos, untruth, sorrow, cruelty, sickness and death
 manushya, jo ki ahura majadaa kii sarvshereshth kriti he, kii is sangharsh main kendriya bhoomika he
 He has to voluntarily take on the evil spirit in this struggle
 is yuddh main uske astr honge achchhai, satya, shakti, bhakthi, adarsh evam amartv
 By following these principles, humans will eventually end all the evil in the world
 kuch adhik vaigyanik kasuti par dharm ko parakhane vaale 'spenta manu' kii vyakhya alag tarah se karte hai
 According to it, the 'spenta menu' is not a soul, but an incremental, progressive mind or mindset
 arthath yah ahura majadaa kaa ek gun he, vah gun jo brahmand kaa nirmaan evam sanvardhan karata he
 God created the spenta menu so that a happy world could be created
 pragatisheel maansikta hi prithvi par manushyon ko do virgon main baantati he
 The virtuous, who promote the world and the vicious, who stop its progress
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki prayek vyakti ishwar tulya bane, jeevandaayee urja ko apanaae tathaa nirmaan, sanvardhan evam pragati kaa vaahak bane
 According to the teachings of Prophet Zarathustra, the world is a moral system
 is vyavastha ko swayan ko kaayam hi nahin rakhana he, balki apana vikaas tathaa sanvardhan bhi karnaa he
 Inertia is not allowed in Zarathosti religion
 vikaas kii prakriya main buree takatein baadha pahunchaati hai, parantu manushya ko isse vichlit nahin hona he
 He has to keep moving in the direction of development always while maintaining the path of virtue
 jivan ke prayek kshan kaa ek nishchit uddeshy he
 It is not something that starts spontaneously and ends spontaneously

 nirashavad va avsaad ko to paap kaa darja diya gaya he
 Zarathustra wants humans to enjoy this world fully and be happy
 vah jo bhi kare, bas ek baat kaa khyaal avashya rakhe or vah yah ki sadachaar ke maarg se kabhi vichlit na ho
 a life endowed with material comforts is not forbidden, but it has also been said that you give more than what you take from the society
 kisi kaa haq markar yaa shoshan karke kuch paanaa duraachaar he
 Those who are less rich than us should always help
 jarathosti dharm main daihik mrityu ko buraai kii asthaayee jeet mana gaya he
 After this, the soul of the deceased will be judged
 yadi vah sadaachari hui to anand va prakaash main vaas paaegi or yadi duraachaari hui to andhkaar va nairashya kii gaharaaiyon main jaaegi, lekin duraachaari aatma kii yah sthiti bhi asthaayee he
 After all, Zoroastrian religion considers the ultimate aim of the world to be the victory of good, not the punishment of evil
 atah yah manyata he ki antat kai muktidaata aakar buraai par achchhai kii jeet puri karenge
 Then Ahura Mazda will be well-supported as Aseem Prakash

 Ranikore Assembly Constituency is an assembly constituency in the Indian state of Meghalaya
 yahan se vartmaan vidhayak pius marvalin hai
 Following is the list of mlas from this constituency - asian junglee bhainsa kii sankhya aaj 4000 se bhi kam rah gai he
 a large number of wild buffalo found throughout Southeast Asia up to a century ago is found only in India, Nepal, Burma and Thailand
 bharat main kajiranga or maanas rashtriya udyaan main ye paaya jaataa he
 In central India, it is found in Raipur division and Bastar in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh main inaki darj sankhya aath he jinhe ab surakshit ghere main rakh kar unka prajnan kaarykram chalaaya ja rahaa he
 But therein lies the problem that the female is only one and that the female also has a villager's claim that she is his domesticated buffalo
 khayr gramin ko to muaavja de diya gaya par samasya fir bhi bani hui he, maadaa keval nar shavakon ko hi janm de rahi he, ab tak usne do nar bachhdon ko janm diya he
 It was only after the birth of the first male cub that forest officials took recourse to prayers and vows for the birth of a female cub
 or to or shashan ne to ek kadam aage jaakar udyaan main mahila sanchalika kii niyukti bhi kar di, taaki maadaa bhens ko kuch ishaara to mili, par nateeja fir vahi hua maadaa ne fir nar shaavak ko hi janm diya
 Perhaps the saying that applies to domesticated buffaloes also applies to buffalo standing buffalo instead of bean before buffalo
 maadaa apane jivan kaal main 5 shavakon ko janm detii he, inaki jivan avadhi 9 varsh kii hoti he
 Male cubs leave the herd at the age of two
 shavakon kaa janm aksar barish ke mausam ke ant main hota he
 Normally the female bison and cubs form the herd and the males live separately from the herd, but if a female of the herd is ready to conceive then the most powerful male does not allow any other male to come near her
 yah nar aam taur par jhund ke aasapaas hi bana rahata he
 If the mother of a cub dies, other drugs take her
 inkaa swabhaavik shatru baagh he, par yadi junglee bhainsa kamjor boodha yaa biimaar ho to junglee kutton or tenduon ko bhi inkaa shikaar karte dekha gaya he
 However, their biggest danger is from the infectious diseases of domestic cattle, the main disease is foot and mouth
 ridanrpest naam kii beemaari ne ek samay inaki sankhya main bahut kami laa di thi
 The second major threat to them is genetic pollution, with bison establishing contact with domesticated buffalo
 haalanki flamand or tulaach jaise shodhakartao kaa maananaa he ki aam taur par junglee nar bhainsa paaltu nar bhainse ko maadaa ke paas nahin aane detaa par swayan paaltu maadaa bhainse se sampark kar letaa he par is vishay par abhi gaharaai se shodh kiya janaa baaki he
 The domesticated buffaloes of the areas where it is found in central India are also similar to them
 is baat ko ek mjedaar ghatana se samajha ja saktaa he
 a few years ago a team of Bombay Natural History Society along with Mr
 Raman Pandya, Forest Officer of Bijapur reached Indravati National Park to study and photograph wild buffaloes, saw a large herd of wild buffaloes and took hundreds of pictures of them And one Mr
 who at that time was considered to be very knowledgeable of wild buffalo in the country, the rest of the people of bison and domesticated buffalo Ic busy explaining inter suddenly a shepherd and took Hank all buffaloes
 madhya bharat main junglee bhainson ke viluptata kii kagaar par pahunchne kaa ek pramukh kaaran uskaa vyahvaar he
 While Gaur goes to high places in the rain, the same wild buffalo live around the fields in the plains and cause great damage to the fields
 is kaaran gaanv vaale unka shikaar kar dete hai
 There is also a reason that the natural forests have been destroyed and replaced by trees like teak, sal, eucalyptus which meet the urban needs
 inamen se kuch ke pattey akhaadya he, inke neeche vah ghaas nahin ug paati jinako ye khate he, vaise bhi junglee bhainse bahut chuninda bhojan karti he
 Due to this also their conflict with the villagers has increased a lot
 takaraav badhane kaa ek kaaran yah bhi he, ki pehle adivasee berwa paddati se kheti karte the
 They did not have to work very hard in this
 jangal ke tukade jala kar uname bina hal chalaaye beej chhidak diye jate the
 The ash was a very good fertilizer
 paidaavaar bhi bahut acchhee mil jaati thi
 Apart from this, Kandamul and Phal were also found in abundance in the forests
 yada kada kiye jane vaale shikaar se bhi unhe bhojan kii kami nahin hoti thi
 They were not completely dependent on farming
 isaliye vanya praaniyon dwaara fasal main se kuch hissaa kha liye jane par iname bair bhav nahin aata tha
 And because of changing the place every two or three years, the grasslands used to become grasslands in the back
 vanya praaniyon ko chaare kii koi kami nahin hoti thi
 Therefore, their number of occasional hunts did not decrease
 ab chunki adivaasiyon ke paas sthai khet hai, jinaki urvartaa uttarottar kam hoti jaati he
 And plowing in them has to be done like weeding and applying fertilizer, which takes a lot of labor and money
 iske alaava kheton kii gheraabandi ke liye baans-balli or anya van utpaada lene kii ijaajat bhi nahin he, atah ab adivasee apni fasalon ke nuksaan par vanya praaniyon ke jaani dushman ho jate hai
 Due to all these reasons, wild buffaloes have come under the category of rarest animals today
 khayr yah sab ho chukaa he or is nuksaan kii bharpai karnaa hamaare bas main nahin he
 But there is one place which is untouched by the destruction of development till date
 vah jagah aaj bhi thik waisi he jaisaa prakruti ne use karodo saalon ke vikaas kram se banaaya he, jahaan aaj bhi berwa paddati se kheti hoti he or jahaan aaj bhi van bhainsa bade jhundo main shaan se vichrata dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan badi sankhya main baagh, bhaaluu, dhol, pahari maina or anek anya jaanavar shanti se apana apana jivan yaapan kar rahe hai
 Where thousands of species of vegetation, trees and plants, many of which have become extinct from the rest of India, are flourishing today
 kareeb 5000 varg kilometre ke is swarg kaa naam he abujhmaad
 There are neither smoke-blowing factories nor mines blowing dust, nor are there roads through which destruction can reach here
 par yah sab kuch badalane vaala he or kuch to badal bhi chukaa he
 The so-called comrades of the tribals living here are holding guns
 hajaaro saalon tak swarg rahi is dharti par in swayambhu kamredon ne baroodon ke dher laga diye hai
 These people have laid such landmines on this picturesque land, which the security forces cannot differentiate between tribals and wildlife
 or sabase bade khed kii baat to yah he, ki jin yojanaon kaa dar dikhaa kar inhone adivaasiyon ko bhadkaaya tha, hamaari sarkaar aaj unheen ko lagu karne ja rahi he
 Mines are being allocated here without reaching Abujmad and without conducting any study
 or hamaare vanshajon kii is dharohar ko isaliye nahin barabaad kiya jaayegaa, ki desh main louh ayask kii koi kami he, balki is ayask ko niryaat karke pehle hi dhan kuber ban chuke khadaanapatiyon kaa laalach ab sari simaaen tod chukaa he or ve itane taqatvar ho chuke hai, ki ab ve netaaon ke nahin balki netaa unke ishaaron par naachte he
 Wildlife and tribals have no value in their eyes
 prakritik asantulan, global varming, nadiyon kaa pani viheen hona or akaal jaise shabdon kaa inase koi vaasta nahin
 As long as any place in the world is worth living, then they will have enough money to live happily
 inhi karatuuton se hamaare in jangalon main bachi hui junglee bhainson kii aabaadi bhi nasht ho jaayegi

 unhone jaliyanvaala baag cond ke samay punjab ke garvanar general rahe maaikel o' dwir ko landan main jaakar goli maari
 Many historians believe that this massacre was a well-planned conspiracy by o'dwyer and other British officials, aimed at intimidating Punjabis to maintain control over Punjab
 yahi nahin, o' dwir baad main bhi general diar ke samarthan se peeche nahin hataa tha
 It is a common belief that Udham Singh killed General Dyer, responsible for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, because of the similar name, but historians believe that while Administrator o'dwyer was killed by Udham Singh, the general who carried out the firing was Dyer died in 1927 after suffering from paralysis and a variety of diseases

 The demographic effects of famine are acute

 a consistent demographic fact is that the male mortality rate is higher than the female in all recorded famines, even in populations where the male normally enjoys longevity

 The experience of famine relief organizations around the world in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major activities: the "livelihood approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis
 Stressful conditions of food will be tackled by limiting the supply of consumption by individuals and groups, which may be an alternative means of supplemental income, etc
 before trying dismal measures such as selling plots of arable land

 KRRF studies have recently been done by helping in the development of the model mouse
 Mice infected with RRV develop arthralgia / hind-limb arthritis which is similar to human disease
 The disease in mice is characterized by an inflammatory macrophages imuno pathogenic which are intrusive, including increased disease
 Furthermore, protein deficiency in C3 mice does not suffer from severe disease following infection
 This suggests that a deleterious innate immune response is responsible for severe illness after RRV infection

 There are countless applications of these sensors about which most people are not yet aware
 in anuprayogon main gaadiyaan, mashin, antariksh praudyogiki, dawa, vinirmaan or robotics shaamil hai
 The sensitivity of a sensor indicates how often the sensor's output changes when the measured amount changes
 udhaahranswaroop, yadi taapmaana main 1 °C ke parivartan ke falswaroop tharmametre kaa paara 1 cm dravit hota he, to isaki samvedansheeltaa 1 cm / °C hoti he

 a smoke detector is a device that specifically detects smoke as a fire indicator
 vyavsaayik, audyogic or bade paimaane par upyog hone vaale awasaiya upkaran aag lagane kii chetavanee dene vaali ek pranali ko sanket dete hai, jabaki gharelu detector, jinhen smoke alarm, aam taur par detector se hi sthaneey rup se sunai or / yaa dikhaai dene vaali chetavanee dete hai
 The smoke detector is typically placed in a disk-shaped plastic enclosure with a diameter of about 150 millimeters and thickness of about 25 millimeters
 adhikansh smoke detector yaa to prakaashiya pahchaan yaa bhautik prakriya ke dwaara kaam karte hai, jabaki anya detector dhuen ke prati samvedansheeltaa ko badhaane ke liye pahchaan kii donon vidhiyon kaa upyog karte hai
 Sensitive alarms can be used to detect and thus prevent smoking in restricted areas such as toilets and schools

 However, in many single-family and small multiple-family dwellings, smoke alarms are often operated only once by a single usable battery

 jaigar kaa prayog un prayaason main se ek tha jisane aadhunik smoke detector kaa maarg prashast kiya
 However, it was only after 30 years that advances in molecular chemistry and solid state electronics made it possible to manufacture a cheaper sensor
 jabaki 1960 ke adhikansh dashak ke dauraan gharelu smoke detector uplabdh the, in upkarnon kaa mulya thodaa adhik tha
 Earlier, alarms were so expensive that only major businesses and theaters could afford them
 pehali baar sahi myne main saste gharelu smoke detector kaa avishkaar 1965 main duan di

 The first commercial smoke detector became available in the market in 1969
 aaj ve america ke 93% or britain 85% gharon main sthapit hai
 However it is estimated that more than 30% of such alarms do not work at any given time, because users remove the batteries, or forget to replace them
 haalanki iskaa shrey aamtaur par nasa ko diya jaataa he, par smoke detectaron kaa avishkaar antariksh kaarykram ke parinamswaroop nahin kiya gaya tha yadhyapi ek samyojya samvedansheeltaa vaale sanskaran ko skylab ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha
 The optical detector is a light sensor
 smoke detector ke rup main upyog kiye jane par isamen prakaash kaa ek strot, prakaash ko kiran punj kii sidh main rakhane ke liye ek lens or prakaash detector ke rup main kiran punj ke kone par ek photo diod yaa anya vidyutprakashiya sensor shaamil hota he
 In the absence of smoke, the light passes in a straight line through the front of the detector
 jab dhuaan prakaash ke kiran punj ke raste main chaaron ore optical kaksh main pravesh karata he, to dhuen ke kanon dwaara kuch prakaash bikhar jaataa he, jo ise sensor kii taraf bhejtaa he or is prakaar alarm sakriy karata he
 In large rooms, such as a gymnasium or an auditorium, devices that detect a projected beam
 diwaar main lagi hui ek ikai ek kiran punj bhejti he jise yaa to ek alag nigaraanee karne vaale upkaran ke dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he yaa ek darpan ke madhyam se waapas bhej diya jaataa he
 When the beam beam is less visible to the sensor's eye, it sends a danger signal to the control panel warning the fire
 rashtriya agni suraksha abhikaran ke anusaar, "vidyut prakaashiya dhune kii pahchaan aam taur par aag ke prati adhik pratikriyasheel hoti he jo ek lambey samay tak sulagate rahane ke saath shuru hoti he
 "furthermore, a study by the alleged NFPA by the State of California A&M and the City of Palo Alto California expresses that," electromagnetic alarms reacted more slowly to fires that spread faster than ionizing alarms
 , But laboratory and field tests have shown that electromagnetic smoke alarms are sufficient for all types of fires Of the individuals who do and give them warning seen very rarely disable them
 " Although optical alarms have been highly effective in detecting smoldering fires and provide adequate protection from blazing fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing combination alarms, which are alarms that are either Detects both heat and smoke or uses ionization and electro-optical / optical processes
 sinsinati vishvavidhyalay dwaara kiye gaye ek snaatak anusandhan adhyayan ke anusaar, vidyut prakaashiya alarmon main pareshaani paidaa karne vaale alarm paidaa karne kii bahut kam sambhaavna thi, ve sulagane vaale aag kaa pataa lagane main behatar hai evam ve dadhakati aag kaa pataa lagane main bhi utane hi prabhavi hote hai
 It is worth noting that not all optical or electro-optical detection methods are the same
 photodod yaa optical sensor ke prakaar evam unki samvedansheeltaa or dhuaan vaale kaksh alag-alag nirmaataaon main bhinn hote hai
 This type of detector is much cheaper than an optical detector; However, it is sometimes rejected because it is more prone to false alarms than electrically optic smoke detectors

 Smoke entering the chamber absorbs alpha particles, which reduces ionization and hinders this current and activates the alarm
 241am, ek alpha utsarjak kii aadhi aayu 432 varsh hoti he
 Alpha radiation, unlike beta and gamma, is used for two additional reasons: Alpha ears are ionized, so large amounts of air particles will be ionized to maintain current and have low penetrating power, ie They will be intercepted by the plastic and / or air of the smoke detector

 The International Association of Fire Chiefs, the University of Texas A&M and major smoke alarm manufacturers have demonstrated significant deficiencies regarding performance in the field of ionized smoke alarms

 These detectors are connected in parallel to the signaling path or starting device circuit in order to notify the closure of the circuit path by a connected detector when smoke or other similar environmentally stimulating object greatly affects a detector
 The flow of can be monitored
 The resulting increase in stream current is interpreted as a confirmation of the presence of smoke by the control unit and is processed and produces a fire warning signal
 is prakaar kaa instolation kisi pranali main shaamil prayek detector ko ek vyaktigat sankhya yaa pataa detaa he
 Thus, addressable detectors enable fire extinguishers by a FACP to obtain the exact position information of an alarm indicated on a diagram
