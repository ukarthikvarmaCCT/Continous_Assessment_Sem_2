 shiksha kaa kaary balak ko apni aatma kaa gyaan pradaan karnaa he jo bhautik sharir se adhik yatharth he

 He supported only those principles which he himself converted into action
 is drushtikon se unhen ek prayojanavaadee bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Maharishi Arvind Ghosh believed in the universal mind and was an idealist with a warm heart but never saw the practical side of his idealism as neglected
 unhone kaha ki paathyakram baalkon kii ruchiyon par aadhaarit hona chahie or vaastavik jivan main unke liye upyogi hona chahie
 In education scheme, teacher should be ranked as director and friend
 unka yah vichaar prayojanavaadiyon ke vichaaron se miltaa-julata he
 Contrary to the Indian national character, the nature of contemporary Indian education and education philosophy is synthesizing
 ham shiksha ke sabhi kshetron main nissandeh adarshavaadi darshan ke samarthak hai
 But this idealistic approach has been influenced by many and varied philosophical ideas from time to time
 samakaleen parivartanon ke kaaran rashtriya charitra itnaa sheeghra parivartansheel he
 The advent of modern industries based on science as well as rapid social changes has resulted in many changes in educational problems
 kintu parivartansheel sansar main keval jivicoparjan kii vidhi siikhnaa hi shiksha kaa lakshya nahin ho saktaa

 kuch logo kii dharna he ki baalkon ko parivartansheel samay ke liye prashikshit karne kaa ekmaatr maarg unhen aisi shiksha pradaan karnaa he jo swat: "vikasshil" he

 In addition, assuming that we are pure and firm idealists, the idealistic principle of us Indians is a broad and universal principle
 iske antargat vibhinn sampradaay sammilit hai or is prakaar is siddhanth ko sadaiv prabal ativaadee rup main, kabhi bhi nahin saraahaa gaya he
 It has been a strong foundation for the spiritual advancement of the individual and society
 prayonavad bhi apane ativaadee rup main anishchit disha kii ore sadaa pragati karte rahane kaa sandesh detaa he
 Indian educationists, like a practicalist, give the message of progress, but advise the individual and the life-boat of the society not to steer towards the vague direction, but towards the sure direction
 pashchimi yathartwaadiyon ne jagat ke thos evam yatharth dharaatal par rahane kaa sandesh diya he

 Acharya Shankar, who considers the world as Maya, has also considered the world to be true from a practical point of view
 bhartiya vichaarak maanate hai ki shastron main kushal hote hue bhi log vyavhaar se pruthak purush murkh hota he
 Yes, it is a matter of course that Indian educationists do not consider public behavior very true
 ek seemaa tak hi isaki satta he
 He is not a planetary by paying the price of spirituality
 is loukik jagat ke malyankan kaa mandand unhone aadhyatmik unnayan ko hi mana he
 Therefore, Indian educationist rises above the ground of realism by adopting a realistic approach
 prayojanavaad, adarshavaad evam prakrutwad ke bich kii kadi he
 a person who is naturalist cannot be objective or idealistic
 kintu jo vyakti yatharthwaad tak ke maarg par chalata he use bich ne prayojanavaad ko kahin na kahin paar karnaa padataa he
 Purposeism comes in the way of the distance from naturalism to idealism
 is drushti se sabhi bhartiya shiksha-shastri kisi na kisi rup main prayojanavaadee kahe ja sakate hai
 Mahatma Gandhi has all his elements
 apni pustak `mahatma gandhi kaa shiksha-darshan' main da em es patel ne jo vichaar gandhi ke vishay main vyakt kiye hai ve anya bhartiya shiksha-shastriyon ke vishay main bhi paryaapt maatra main lagu hote hai
 Dr
 patel pehle likhte hai
 "study Gandhi's philosophy with caution, but it will be clear that naturalism, idealism and purposeism are helpful in his teaching - Gandhi's philosophy of education is naturalistic enough
 jab yah balak kii prakruti kaa purna vivaran prastut karata he or iske adhyayan par bal detaa he
 Gandhi's philosophy of education is naturalistic in its establishment, idealistic in its purpose and purposeful in the planning and method of work - Gandhi's importance as an education philosopher lies in the fact that naturalistic, idealistic and purposeful tendencies in his philosophy Separate and independent, they have become one and they have developed as an education doctrine which meets the needs of today Nukul will and will satisfy the holiest aspirations of the human spirit

 In his presidential speech at the Tripura session, Subhash Chandra declared with great foresight that an imperialist war would soon begin in Europe and that the British should give an ultimatum of six months on this occasion
 unke is prastaav kaa varking cameti ke purvakalil sadasyon ne virodh kiya
 Subhash Babu felt that due to unfavorable conditions, he is meaningless to hold the post of Congress President

 Subhash Babu explained that the Forward Blocks were established to fulfill a historic need - the organization of all anti-imperialist powers and the inevitable struggle
 unhone kaha ki antarrashtriya sankat main grast ho jane ke purv congress kaa aantarik sankat samaapt ho janaa chahie
 Organizing the Left, gaining a majority in the Congress and reviving the national movement - these were the three questions facing the forward block

 In April 1940, the Forward Bloc launched a nationwide satyagraha, appealing to the public to disagree with the imperialist war and to oppose the exploitation of Indian means to maintain the English state
 saikadon vyakti jail main daale gaye yaa pite gaye or janata ko prachand daman kaa shikaar hona padaa
 At the Nagpur session of the party, Subhash Babu again emphasized the Ramgarh pledge and explained its important role in terms of the intensity of the conflict
 nagpur main hi nishchit kiya gaya ki farward block bhavishya main maatr ek manch na rahakar, ek dal ke rup main kaary karegaa
 With the possibility of the Congress Socialist Party and Radical Democratic Party separating from the Left Organization Committee proposed and organized by the Bloc and the growing war situation in Europe and other continents also getting wrapped up in the war of the bloc, the bloc has given the country a "working" national Government, National Defense For Establishment and for proper protection from foreign invasion under it The demand for immediate construction
 sampurna raashtra "bhartiya janata ke haath main satta sonpo" ke udghosh ke saath antim vijay ke liye aage bad chalaa
 With the resolve to take over the struggle and power, the idea was also presented in the conference that every village and factory should be made self-supporting through the panchayat
 ye panchayatein or svaichhik sanghathan hi kaarynirvaahi rashtriya sarkaar kii maang ke aadhaar bane, jise sari satta turat hastantarit kar di jaay
 To act as a party, the bloc decided that it would function within the Congress, including majority membership

 Subhash Chandra Bose was arrested in July immediately after the Nagpur session
 disambar main unke aamaran eashan ke kaaran unhen rahaa kiya gaya
 At the same time, Gandhiji also changed his views, seeing the response of the public on the call of Subhash and Forward Bloc, and in October 1940 he raised the slogan of Personal Satyagraha
 vyaktigat satyagraiyon ko jo shapath leni padati thi, vah ansh: blaak kii ramgarh ghoshnaa se milti julati thi
 In January 1941, Subhash Chandra Bose suddenly escaped from his residence in Calcutta despite great supervision by the police and intelligence department, and 30 months later landed on the war-torn soil of Southeast Asia

 After the war, the Forward Bloc attempted to consolidate its scattered powers, but due to differences within the party, it split into two factions - the Subhashist Forward Bloc and the Marxist Forward Bloc
 gutbandi ke purv farward block ne bharatvibhaajan kaa teevr virodh kiya tha
 The bloc called the Indian partition a conspiracy by the British to deprive India and Pakistan of everlasting power

 This is an example of sexual production
 falon ke pedo main is vidhi se ugaae paudhon main apane pita kii tulana main bahudhaa kuch na kuch parivartan dekhne main aata he
 Therefore, the production of new improved species of plants is possible only through sexual method

 Supporting germination - Most seeds germinate very easily when sown properly, but some are seeds of a species that grow over a period of time
 prayogon main dekha gaya he ki enzimon ke gholon main bijon ko kai ghanton bhigon rakhane par adhik pratishat beej ankurit hote hai
 Sometimes chemical substances are also used to soften the hardened bone peels above the seed and to sharpen them

 Sweet pea seeds, which do not freeze soon, can be stored in semisolid sulfuric acid for 30 minutes
 yah upachaar beej ke upar ke kathor chhilake ko naram karne ke liye yaa fatne main sayhayta pahunchaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But in every case it is necessary to wash the seed thoroughly with water after treatment
 jin bijon ke chhilake itane kathor hote hai ki saadhaaran ritiyon kaa unpar koi prabhaav nahin padataa unke liye yantric sahaayta leni chahie
 Often sanding, bending, or piercing are also used
 boe jane par beej santoshprad reeti se ugen, is uddeshy kii purti ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki kis beej ko kis samay bona chahie
 Some seeds require a lot of time to grow or they grow in a particular season and people often consider them useless before they start growing
 isse bachane ke liye hi baat nahin, apitu thodaa-thodaa karke kishton main beej bona chahie
 Vegetation methods prove very useful for planters and fruit cultivators, mainly because these methods always provide the desired quality of trees
 in vidhiyon ko teen virgon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Growing new plants from any part of the plant such as root, knot, tuber, leaves or stem, with or without the eye is called shearing
 ropane par in khandon main se hi jaden nikal aati hai or nae padap utpann ho jate hai
 This is often the cheapest, quickest and simplest method to grow more and more plants
 tahani ke kartan lagane ko mali log "khanti gaadna" kehete hai
 Some people also call it "planting a pen", but the use of the word pen is appropriate in the same relation in which the organ of one plant is planted at the root of another
 daaba main nae padap tabhi jad phenkate hai jab ve apane mul vriksh se sambhddha rahete hai
 There are three types of plant breeding by this method: Top pressure - In this type the top of a twig is bent downwards and roots reach out when it reaches the ground
 iske sabase sundar udhaaharan respberi or loganberi hai
 Simple pressure - For this, tilt the twig and put soil on it as needed
 is prakaar se anek jati ke padap badi saralata se ugaae ja sakate hai
 Sometimes, without bending the ground to the dal, some other soil is imprinted on it and it is wrapped with sack and tied with rope
 isko "gutti bandhna" kehete hai
 The soil is watered daily
 mishra daab main padap kii pradhan daali ko jhukaakar kai sthanon par mitti daal dete hai, bich-bich main thodaa-thodaa bhaag khulaa chhod dete hai
 People often adopt this method for breeding vines like grapes

 Under this, both the method of sheltering creepers and twigs and pruning them
 pehali baat ke sahare padpon ko icchaanusaar rup diya ja saktaa he
 As per the wishes of the pruner for figurative plants, they can be given conical form, canopy etc
 and sometimes they are given the form of elephant, horse etc
, but the fruit trees are usually given the form of urn or flower
 And the central part is not allowed to be dense
 chhantai kaa uddeshy yah hota he ki padap ke praaia: anaavashyak bhaag nikaal die jaaen jisase bachaa hua bhaag adhik utpaadan kar sake yaa adhik sundar, pusht or swasth ho jaae
 In some flowers, such as roses, pruning of roots and twigs is done so that more flowers are grown
 kuch main puraani lakdi isliye chhant di jaati he ki aisi nai tahaniyaan jinpar phool lagate hai
 Sorting weak, diseased and dense twigs are removed by pruning
 karshan shabd kaa prayog yahan par do bhinn karmon ke liye kiya gaya he : ek to us chhichhli or baar-baar kii janevaali godai yaa khurpiyane ke liye jo ghaas paat maarane ke uddeshy se kii jaati he or duusare us gahari jotai ke liye jo prati varsh isliye kii jaati he ki bhoomi ke neeche ghaas paat tathaa jaden aadi dab jaaen
 There is generally a great need for plowing in cultivation and flower cultivation
 bharat kii adhikansh jagahon main falon ke udyaan main bhoomi par ghaas ugna vaanchhneeya nahin he or isliye thodi bahut godai aavashyak ho jaati he
 There is no doubt that the primary purpose of weeding or hoofing is the elimination of unwanted weeds, so it should be done only when they are small and have not deep-rooted their roots
 yah karshan chhichhlaa hona chahie taaki tarkari, phool yaa falon kii jadon ko haani na pahunche
 Light traction and weeding is good once after every irrigation in the dry season
 iske saath hi falon kii udyanbhumi ko, kam-se-kam garmi main or phir ek baar barsaat main, palatanevaale hal se avashya jot dena chahie
 When to plow is also important
 yadi adhik geeli bhoomi par jotai kii jaae to avashya hi isse bhoomi ko haani pahunch sakati he
 Such loss is more in heavy soil than light soil
 saadhaarant: jotai vahi acchhee hoti he jo paryaapt sukhi bhoomi par kii jaae, parantu bhoomi itani sukhi bhi na rahe ki bade-bade chippad ukhdane lagen
 Spraying of special chemical substances without plowing in fruit orchards and fertilizer fields has also proved useful
 yadi padpon kii paraspar duuri thik he to falon ke nae udyaan main bahut si bhoomi aisi padi rahegi jo varshon tak falwaale vrikshon ke kaam main na aegi
 Early fruits, such as papaya, or any plant can be produced in this land
 bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke padpon ko itani vibhinn matraaon main pani kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki inke liye koi vyapak niyam nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 How much water is given and when it is given depends on which plant and season
 gamale main lage paudhon ko sukhi ritu main prati din pani dena aavashyak he
 For all plants, the land should remain moist so that their floods do not stop
 falon ke bhi samuchit vikaas ke liye nirantar pani kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 It should be remembered that the moisture content in the soil should never be so low that the plants wither away and cannot grow again
 acchhee sinchai vahi he jisamen pani kam se kam maatra main kharaab jaae
 This malfunction can occur for a number of reasons: water flowing from the upper surface, penetrating to unnecessary depths, evaporation from the upper surface, and the necessary water being drained by the weeds
 panktiyon main lagi hui tarkariyon kii bagal ko bagal kii naaliyon dwaara seenchna saral he
 Small trees can be watered by making a plate
 thale is prakaar yojit hon ki padpon ke mul tak kii bhoomi sinch jaae
 As the trees grow, the circle of plates should be increased
 bade se bade vrikshon kii sinchai ke liye naaliyon kii paddati hi kuch parivartit rup main upyogi hoti he
 For intelligent irrigation, it is absolutely necessary to keep an eye on the condition of trees and land

 Screwed Burma can also be used to find out the moisture of the land
 padpon ko uchit aahaar milanaa sabase mahatv kii baat he
 Fruits and vegetables consume more food from land than other crops

 But how much an element can get to the plant depends on many things, such as which mineral is present in the soil, how much of the soil is in the form of soil, how much moisture is in the soil and its acidity
 adhikansh fasalon ke liye bhoomi main nitrogen, fasphoras tathaa potacium daalana upyogi paaya gaya he, kyonki ye tatv vibhinn fasalon dwaara newnaadhik maatra main nikal jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to see that the balance of these elements of the land remains as per the requirement of the plants
 kisi ek tatv ke bahut adhik maatra main daalane se duusare tatwon main kami yaa asantulan utpann ho saktaa he, jisase upaj main kami aa sakati he
 Nitrogen and botanical substances are the most important parts of manure for Indian soil
 yah samaran rahe ki bhoomi-bhoomi main antar hota he; isliye is sambandh main koi ek vyapak nuskhaa nahin bataaya ja saktaa jiskaa prayog sarvatra kiya ja sake
 Some nitrogen-giving items are: - Organic sources: compost of dung, droppings, urine, garbage, etc
; Khali and green crops that can be used as manure, such as linseed, tinapatiya moong, dhencha etc
 ajivajanit strot : uria, jisamen 40 pratishat nitrogen hota he, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate tathaa sodium nitrate 
 Ordinary: 50 to 12 pounds of nitrogen per acre in the land can be expected to be satisfactory
 yah sambhav he ki fasphoras bhoomi main paryaapt maatra main rahe, parantu padpon ko keval dhire-dhire praapt ho
 It has been observed that sometimes where other crops were very poor, the fruit garden flourishes very well without adding phosphorus material to the ground, probably because the fruit trees need phosphorus gradually
 It only happens
 khaadon main tathaa sabhi prakaar ke jeevajanit padaarthon main kuch-na-kuch fasphoras rahata he
 But the phosphorous special things are these - bone powder, basic slag and super phosphate which are used extensively
 isamen 16 se 40 pratishat fasphoras pentaxide rahata he
 In those soils that stabilize phosphorus, the first phosphorus must be added so that some phosphorus is left for plants even when stabilized, but those that do not stabilize phosphorus should not contain a large amount of phosphorus, Otherwise the balance will deteriorate and other components will fall
 jis bhoomi main sulabh potacium kii maatra bahut hi kam hoti he usamen potacium dene par darshneey antar padataa he, jo upaj kii vruddhi se spasht ho jaataa he
 Potassium sulfate and potassium chloride are commonly used for fertilizer
 inamen se prayek main lagbhag 50 pratishat potacium oxide hota he
 Potassium nitrate contains 44 percent potassium oxide; Along with this, 13 percent nitrogen is also present
 jeevajanit khaadon main bhi 50 pratishat yaa adhik potacium oxide ho saktaa he
 Polybhenyl acetate is an organic compound
 vilwanikaran un kai prakriyaaon ko sanderbhit karata he jo pani se namak tathaa duusare khanijon ko nikaalati hai
 Generally, the process of removing salts and minerals is also called desalination, such as soil desalination khaare pani ko mithe pani main badalane ke liye diselination kiya jaataa he taaki yah maanav khapat yaa sinchai ke liye upyukt bana rahe
 kabhi kabhi is prakriya dwaara khaane vaala namak ek sah-utpaada ke rup main banataa he
 It is used in seaplanes and submarines
 un kshetron main jahaan taaze pani kii uplabdhta simit he yaa ho rahi he, vahaan saste dhang se taaze pani ko uplabdh karaane ke liye aajkal diselination par dhyaan kendrit kiya ja rahaa he
 Large-scale desalination typically requires special infrastructure, with a high degree of energy, which increases its cost considerably compared to fresh water from rivers or land
 duniya kaa sabase bada diselination sanyantr sanyukt arab emirate main jebel ali sanyantr he
 It is a dual-purpose unit that uses multi-stage flash distillation and is capable of producing 300 million cubic meters of water per year
 isaki tulana main sanyukt rajya america kaa sabase bada diselination sanyantr tempa be, florida main he or tempa be water dwaara sanchalit he, jisane disambar 2007 main prati varsh 34

 The Tempa Bay plant, operating at 12% of the Jebel Ali desalination plant, is operating on 17 January 2008, according to a Wall Street Journal article, "according to the International Desalination Association, 13,080 desalination plants worldwide amount to 12 billion per day Produce more than a gallon of water
 " The traditional process used in these plants is vacuum distillation - essentially boiling water at low atmospheric pressure and thus achieving far lower temperatures than normal
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki drav tabhi ubalata he jab vaashp dabaav aas paas ke dabaav ke baraabar ho jaataa he or vaashp dabaav taapmaana ke saath or bad jaataa he
 Thus, due to low temperature, energy saving is done
 multi-stage flash aswan, jo ek agrani aswan vidhi he, vah 2004 main vishwa ke kul 85 % utpaadan ke liye uttaradaayi thi
 The major competitive processes for desalination are the use of membrane by reverse osmosis technology
 membrane prakriyaayein pani se namak nikaalane ke liye ardh-abhedya membrane tathaa dabaav kaa prayog karti hai
 Reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal distillation, reducing overall desalination costs over the past decade

 Cogeneration is a process in which the excess energy generated in the production of electricity is used to accomplish another task
 diselination ke pariprekshya main, kozenreshan main samudri jal yaa khaare bhoojal ko ek ekikrut yaa "dohare uddeshy" vaali ikai dwaara pine yogya pani main parivartit kiya jaataa he, jisamen diselination prakriya ke liye bijli sanyantr ko ek urja strot ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The unit's energy production may be entirely devoted to potable water, or additional energy may be produced and used in the energy grid
 There are different types of cogeneration and in principle any type of energy production can be used
 haalanki, adhikansh vartmaan or bhavi kozenreshan diselination sanyantr apni urja ke strot ke rup main jeevashm eendhan yaa parmaanu shakti kaa prayog karte hai

" 

 badi maatra main pine ke pani kaa utpaadan karne ke liye
 is prakriya ko pehle se hi duniya bhar main, bharat se le kar japan tathaa rus main prayog main laayaa ja rahaa he
 In Japan alone, eight nuclear reactors connected to desalination plants are operating 


 Nuclear desalination plants can be a source of large amounts of drinking water that can be transported miles inside the border by pipeline
 

 " In addition, the current trend in dual-purpose units is the hybrid configuration in which lime from the RO desalination component is mixed with extracts obtained from thermal desalination

 Such units have already been implemented in Jeddah and Yanbu, Saudi Arabia
 america sena kaa ek vishesh vimaan vaahak parmaanu shakti kaa upyog karke pratidin 400,000 galen yaa 1514 ghan meter pani se namak nikaalata he
 There are several factors that determine capital and operating costs for desalination: capacity and type of unit, location, raw water, labor, energy, financing and disposal of condensed water
 Desalination plants can now control optimization of saline concentrations for pressure, temperature, and water drainage
 bade paimaane par parmaanu shakti se chalane vaale diselination adhik kifayati ho sakate hai
 While it is worth noting that the cost is decreasing and the technology is generally positive for generally affluent areas, which are adjacent to the oceans, one study argues that "desalination for some areas with low water There may be a solution, but it is not a solution for the poor, located in the interior parts of the continent, or at higher altitudes

 If the power plant is of medium to large size and the desalination plant is not huge, then the cold water flow of the power plant will be much higher than that of the desalination plant
 Another method of reducing the increase in salinity is to spread the salty water over a much larger area so that there is only a slight increase in salinity
 For example, once a saline water pipeline reaches the sea level, it may split into several branches, each of which can slowly release saline water through small holes located in its length
 is vidhi ko sanyukt rup se namakeen pani ko bijli ke sanyantr yaa apshisht jal sanyantr se nikalne vaale pani main mila kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Deep seawater has the potential to damage ecosystems, particularly marine areas that already have excessive salinity due to low sedimentation and high evaporation

 For example, water officials at the desalination plant and marine outlet structures, built in Sydney in 2007, stated that marine outlets would be located at extremely high sea depths that would increase the dispersal of dense water in such a way that 50 to 75 of the outlet points It will not be possible to distinguish between this and normal seawater in the range of meters
 Sydney is fortunate to have special ocean conditions located off its coastline that rapidly reduce dense by-products, reducing the damage to the environment

 The project was delayed due to bankruptcy of Paysden Resources' successive partners Stone & Webster in the venture, followed by Coventa and its major subcontractor Hydronautics
 Pysaidon's relationship with Stone & Webster, through S&W Water LLC, ended in June 2000 when Stone & Webster was declared bankrupt and Pisaidon Resources purchased Stone & Webster's stake in S&W Water LLC
 Pisaiden Resources partnered with Coventa and Hydronautics in 2001, changing the name of the association to Tempa Bay Castle
 Due to Coventa's inability to complete the construction of the project, on 15 May 2002 the Tempa Bay Water Agency was forced to purchase the project from Pisaiden and finance the project under its credit rating

 In India, we can divide the study of the condition and direction of philosophy into two parts - upniveshkaleen bhartiya darshanashastra apni prakruti main adhikanshtah adarshavaadi or pratyayvaadee rahaa he
 Since Vedanta was its source, philosophical reconstructions of that period can be called 'neo-vedanti'
 is kaal kii darshanik pravriti ko paashchaatya vichaarkon kii us aalochana ke pratyuttar main bhi dekha ja saktaa he jise albert sweetzar ne apni pustak 'indian thot and its development' main yah kehete hue sanderbhit kiya tha ki bhartiya darshan palaayanwadee he
 In fact, Sweitzer's approach is based on the formalist understanding of thinkers such as Schopenhauer
 iskaa purajor jawaab sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne apni kriti 'eastern religen and western thot' main diya he
 According to him, the notion cannot be historically accepted that Hinduism has negation and despair towards life and the world, while Christian thinking has acceptance and optimism about life and the world
 vastav main donon ke bich kaa vaastavik virodh dharm or swytt-maanavvaadi drushtikon ko lekar he
 The Indian Institute of Philosophy was established in 1916 in Amalner, Maharashtra, courtesy of Srimant Pratap Seth
 1917 main indian filosfical association kaa pehla adhiveshan kolhapur main hua tathaa 'indian filosfical rivyuu' naamak patrika kaa prakaashan bhi prarambh kiya gaya
 The Indian Philosophical Congress was established in 1925
 yah darshanikon kaa ek aisa sanghathan he jo aupniveshik yug se lekar ab tak angrezi madhyam se bhartiya darshanik chintan ke vikaas ke liye sakriy rahaa he
 All these efforts proved to institutionalize Indian philosophy in the colonial era
 swatantrypurv bharat ke pramukh vichaarak shri aravind moulik rup se ek pratyayvaadee darshanik the or unhone vaidic tatvadrushti ko vikasvaadi praaroop main dekhte hue ek aisa samgr advaitavaadi darshan prastut kiya jisamen jad or chetan kaa antaheen dwait na ho kar donon ek hi vaishvik prakriya ke samaan bhagidaar hai
 His philosophy, based on the logic of eternalism and Leeladism instead of Mayanism, is the philosophy of the descent of divine life on this earth, avoiding two extremes such as renunciation-prohibition by materialists and materialism-negation by spiritualists
 apni tatvadrushti, itihaas darshan, samskruti darshan or yogasamanvay dwaara unhone bhartiya sabhyataa-bodh ko duniya ke samaksh ek brahmadia prayojanamoolakta ke saath prastut kiya he
 How confident he must have been with the reality of his philosophical plan, that he also saw India's independence as an integral phenomenon of global frugality
 shri arvind ke atirikt pramukh swatantrypurv bhartiya darshanikon main krishna chandra bhattacharya kaa naam ullekhneey he
 He was the philosopher of modern India who put the reconstruction of Advaita Vedanta to the world parallel to the ideology of Kant and Hegel
 ‘concept of filosphi’, ‘subject ez freedom’ or ‘da concept of ebsolute and its alternetive farms’ jaise nibandhon dwaara unhone apni darshanik punarrachana kii prastuti kii
 Although he has written on almost all the sects of Indian philosophy, the reinterpretation of Jainism's philosophy has taken special significance out of the box
 unhone anekantwaad ke mahatva ko punah udghaatit karte hue dikhaaya ki na to tadatmya or na hi virodh ko taarkik vichaar-sarani ke liye aadharbhoot mana ja saktaa he
 In fact, both identification and opposition can be mutually appropriable and such appropriation of both provides a broad philosophical basis
 tadatmya or virodh ke badale ‘sahavsthaan’ taarkik vichaar-sarani kii apekshaakrit adhik aadharbhoot koti he jise jain darshanikon ne ‘kramarpan or saharpan’ ke do praroopon main dekha he
 Overall, pluralism is a specific logic of indistinguishability that presents the principle of the alternation of truth through Saptabhangi Nay
 bharat ke punarjagran ke pariprekshya main bhattacharya kaa ‘swaraj in idiaz’ naamak vyaakhyaan bhi mahatvapurn he jise unhone 1929 main hughali college, kalakatta ke vidhyaarthiyon ke bich diya tha
 Later in 1954, it was published in visva-bharati Journal
 unka yah vyaakhyaan apane aap main vaicharik swaraj kaa darshanik ghoshnaptr jaisaa he
 His lecture was reprinted in the Indian Philosophical Quarterly published from Pune in 1984
 dayaa krishna, rajendra prasad, ramchandra gandhi, es
pi
 gautam sareekhe logon ne is vyaakhyaan ke bhashya kiye
 Although he gave this lecture in English, he highlighted the importance of ideological Swaraj's mother tongue Rajpath and the unintended consequences of Western ideas
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi nirdeshit kiya ki bhartiya darshan ko kis prakaar ek saarvbhaum gyaan-vidha ke rup main prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Explaining the intention of ideological swaraj, he said that cultural subjugation is generally unconscious and slavery is inherent from the beginning
 bhattacharya kehete hai : In the context of the Indian concept of Swaraj, it is relevant to mention the article of Bhagwan Das, who was presented with Bharat Ratna, which he presented as a proposal letter in the Bombay Congress session of 1921
 yadhyapi un dinon swaraj ke swaroop ko lekar buddhijiviyon ke bich matbhed the or inhen sab ko dur karne ke liye unhone is prastaav-patr ko taiyaar kiya tha, lekin unke is aalekh kii charchaa academik jagat main na ke baraabar hoti he
 Bhagwandas was a distinguished intellectual associated with the Congress and active in the Theosophical Society
 unke anusaar swaraj mul rup main ek naitik pratyay he or vyavastha ke arth main yah swa-shashan he
 Just as a person is inhabited by two kinds of souls — one higher and the other lower — that is, one is governed by both divine and animalistic tendencies, similarly a society and nation also has a higher and lower soul
 koi bhi sarkaar yaa shashan tabhi sushasan athwa swa-shashan mana ja saktaa he jab vah ucchtar aatma dwaara sanchalit ho
 Only the kings and policy inspired by the higher soul can be more and more co-ordinating
 iskaa loktantric kriyanvayan or vyavasthaapan keval vivekwan-vidhayika dwaara hi sambhav he jo prayek vyakti main rahane vaale main or ham ko samanvit kar sake
 Both competition and mutual cooperation are necessary
 bhagavaandas kii yah antardrushti loktantratmak swaraj kii naitik adharbhumi kii ore sanket he
 'the Essential Unity of All Religions' is his most iconic work
 aupniveshik yug ke maanya adhyetaon main aar
di
 ranade kaa vyaktitmalag prakaar tha
 His fame was as a philosopher as well as a mystic
 'a constructive survey of upanishdik filosphi' unki bahumanya kriti he
 In this, he not only presents formalist philosophy with its full dignity and content, but also dismisses Lord Ronaldsey's criticism that Indian philosophy is pessimistic
 unke jeevankaal kii antim kriti 'bhagavadgita ez e filosphi of god realizeshan' thi
 His most important work posthumously was published under the title 'vedanta: The culmination of Thought'
 is granth main brahmasutrakaar baadaraayan ko unhone samanvayakaari darshanik siddh karte hue pratipaadit kiya he ki ‘swaarajyam-vairajyam’ kii vaidic drushti plato ke 'darshanik-raja ke siddhant' kii apeksha ucchtar adarsh prastut karti he
 The person who attained the state of 'swarajyam-vairajam' is actually Devadhidev Ananyadhipati
 ranade ke hi samakaleen anukoolchandra mukherjee the jinhen 'elahabaad kaa plato' kaha jaataa he
 'the Nature of Self' and 'self, Thought and Reality' are his serious philosophical works in which he reveals the form of Param Chaitanya in the british-neohegalist approach in Advaitvedanta
 aupniveshik yug ke bhartiya darshanikon main sarvapalli radhakrishnan kii pratishtha ‘purv or pashchim ke pravaktaa’ ke rup main thi
 He has explained all aspects of human life from the neo-vedantist point of view
 nav-vedant kii tatvamimasaa ko unhone paramatatvavaadi vaishvik darshanik chintan ke pariprekshya main punarvyakhyayit karte hue pratipaadit kiya ki yah drishyman jagat param sat kaa hi abhas he lekin phir bhi yah bhram maatr nahin jaisaa ki advait vedant ke paramparaagat chintak maanate rahe hai
 In fact, Shankar's opposition to Mayaism and acceptance of the preciseness of the world has been a departure characteristic of neo-vedanti thinking of the colonial era
 radhakrishnan kaa dharmik anubhuti ke swaroop kii vyakhya or dharm ke auchity pratipaadan ke kshetra main bhi ullekhneey yogadan rahaa he
 He always promoted comparative philosophy, justifying the need for philosophical dialogue between the East and the West, which is why he played an initiative in establishing the east-west Center at the University of Hawaii, USA
 'ain idialistic vyuu of life' main unhone safaltaapurvak pratipaadit kiya ki buddhi satya ko uski sampoornataa main nahin jaan sakati
 Insight is the dimension of human consciousness where truth is interviewed in its entirety
 yah antahpragyatmak anubhuti dharm, niti or sarvasamaveshi advait satta ko pramanit karti he
 Wisdom becomes relaxed only in analysis, but intuition presents the possibility of an ideal life with a holistic sense in its synthesis business
 radhakrishnan ne adarsh jivan kii avadharana hindu jivan-drushti par lagu kar dikhaai he
 In his second work, 'the Hindu View of Life', he contrasted the West with the Indian truth that India's cultural-religious consciousness, despite being polytheistic, is not opposed to monotheism
 yadhyapi navy-vedant kii tarksmmat vishleshnatmak tatvamimasaa kii shuruyaat aupniveshik yug main krishna chandra bhattacharya se hi hoti he lekin usee parampara main rasbihari das bhi aate hai jinhone use apane tareeke se aage badhaayaa
 Vedanti's reconstruction of Vedanti philosophy can be considered the most fundamental aspect of his philosophical thought under the influence of Kant's dogmatic specific skepticism and Whitehead's thinking
 unki anyaanya kritiyon main 'da isential of advaitizam', 'da filosphi of whitehed' evam 'introction tu shankar' ullekhneey hai
 To understand Das's philosophical contributions, his collection of published writings 'rasbihari Das: Philosophical Essays' is very useful
 beesvin sadi ke darshanikon main ziddu krishnamurthi kaa naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 Krishnamurthy, a commentator on functional human freedom, was not an academic philosopher, but a self-conscious Buddha
 unke vyakhyanon kaa 18 bhaagon main sangrah apane aap main ek vaanmay he
 But in 'commentaries on Living', 'freedom from Know', 'first and Last Liberation' and 'you're the World', his fundamental ideas are systematically received

 The account of Indian philosophy before this bygone period cannot be considered complete until a history of Indian Philosophy published by Surendranath Dasgupta in five volumes is mentioned
 1950 main filosfical congress ne apana rajat jayanti adhiveshan institute of filosphi ke tattwavdhan main yojit kiya
 On this occasion, 'have Sri Arvind Recruited Mayavism?' But four important scholars from that time participated in the important discussion
 ye the indrasen, en
e
 nikam, haridas choudhary or ji
aar
 malkani
 From the point of view of future development of Indian philosophy, this discussion can be called as the squeeze of pre-independence Indian philosophy and the New Testament
 indrasen ne apni prastuti main dikhaaya ki shri arvind ke lilawad main pracheen vedant kaa mayawad apane aap sattawad main roopantarit ho jaataa he or is tarah shri arvind ke darshan main uskaa apane aap khandan ho jaataa he
 Arvind in his Life Divine has enshrined a composite and mortified Advaita in which the unification of root and consciousness occurs
 anant ke tark ko aadhaar main rakhte hue unhone pratipaadit kiya he ki atimanas kii vikasavastha main sagun or nirgun kii ekta swayan anubhuti ke dharaatal se pramanit hoti he
 NA Nikam of Mysore contrasted Shankar's bifurcation and Arvind's emergenceism
 unhone kaha ki arvind dhaatu se nishpann maaya kaa arth maapan parichhedan or bhram athwa dhokhaa ke arth main lete hai
 According to Sri Aurobindo, in fact, the word Maya has been used in Mayanism in another sense, ie, confusion or deception
 nikam ke anusaar arvind ke divya jivan darshan main or advait vedant ke mayawad main mulavidya kii bhoomika ek hi jaisi he
 In this way, in fact, there is such a dualization of two types of logic in Sri Aurobindo, that in the end, Mayanism remains uncovered in his philosophy
 haridas choudhary sweekaar karte hai ki paramatatva kaa swaroop hi aisa he ki usamen ek gahan aadhyatmik antardrushti ke saath mayawad ke liye avkaash rahata hi he
 Therefore, it cannot be abolished in the final
 shri arvind kaa darshan vastutah mayawad ke atikaraman kaa agyaan-prahaan kaa darshan he
 G
 Strong supporter of rational Advaita Vedanta R
 Malkani said outright that Sri Aurobindo does not refute Mayavism
 unke anusaar ekaatmak anubhav main sagun or nirgun kaa samanvay nahin kiya ja saktaa
 For Shankar himself and also for Malkani, power is another Advaita
 tathakthith anant kaa tark a-virodh ke niyam ko nirast nahin kar saktaa
 In fact, it is Mayaivad that presents the utterly contradictory and coherent nature of monotheism where there is no leisure for any kind of metaphysical dualism
 malkani kaa yah bebaak virodh shankar ke advaitvaad ke prati unki gahari nishtha kaa parichaayak he
 His allegiance is also attested by works like 'philosophy of Self' and 'metaphysics of Advaita'
 is prakaar kul mila kar swatantrypurv bharat main darshanashastra kii dasha or disha navvedant kahe jane vaale darshanik chintan ke ird-gird hi gumti rahi
 Vedanta at the hands of Raja Rammohan Roy, Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Sri Aurobindo, Rabindranath Thakur and Gandhi, etc
, was revived as Navvedanta, giving ideological basis to the Indian Renaissance and Independence movement 'indian Swaraj 'darshan' became famous
 us kaal ke academik darshanikon ne jivan or jagat ke prati mayavaadi drushtikon kaa nakaar, jagat kii yathatathyata kii sweekruti tathaa vedanti vishwa-drushti main hi pragatisheel evam rachanaatmak jivan ke liye adhikadhik avkaash nirmit karne ko apane navvedanti darshan kii prasthanamoolak vishistataa banaayi
 At the same time, the Navvedanti contemplation of this period also showed a strong self-consciousness towards the socio-cultural disorders which can never be held compatible with the unique world-view of traditional Vedanta
 is tarah swatantrypurv navvedantvaadi chintan main paramparaagat vedant kii na keval tatvamimasiy punarrachana hui, balki bhartiya samskruti or samaaj main akshipt vikaron ke parimarjan kaa ek vaicharik andolan bhi khadaa kiya gaya
 How the colonial era of Indian philosophy is transformed into the post-independence era and what form it takes in the new era, we get a glimpse of it in another revised edition of the book titled 'contemporary Philosophy'
 radhakrishnan or myorhed ne 1952 main iskaa sampaadan kiya tha

 In this context, it is also necessary to mention the establishment of All India Darshan Parishad here

 Yashdev Shalya played an important role in its establishment

 The intrinsic value of secondary philosophy for the idol is not as a sect of Buddhist philosophy, but as the 'critique of All Philosophies'

 Similarly, exploration of alternative forms of monotheistic philosophies has also been an important point of the philosophical overlordship of the idol
 bhashaa darshan ke kshetra main unka ek aalekh ‘da philosphi of lenguez in kaantext’ unhen bhashaa-darshanik ke rup main bhi pratishthit karata he
 Humayun Kabir's efforts in the field of philosophy cannot be ignored

 The British Board of Film Classification denied it the certificate's permission because, "it was felt that portraying Rushdie rather than just tarnishing his image, causing breach of peace, could be considered criminal libel
" is qadam ne britain main prabhavi dhang se film par purna pratibandh laga diya
 However, two months later, Rushdie himself wrote to the board, stating that in his opinion the film was "a perverted, incompetent worthless creation" and that he would not sue if it was screened
 baad main unhone kaha, "agar us film par pratibandh laga diya jaataa, to vah shahar main sarvaadhik icchit video ban jaataa, har koi use dekh letaa
 "while the film was a massive success in Pakistan, it virtually failed to attract anyone's attention in the West
 unhone kaha ki film kaa ek hissaa sahi myanon main haasyaaspad tha, jab unka charitra unki pustak saetanic varsej ko pard kar ek pakistani ladaaku ko yatnaa detaa he
 On 16 June 2007, Rushdie was awarded a knighthood for services to literature at the Queens Birthday Honors
 unhone kaha, "is mahaan sammaan ko praapt kar main romanchit or vinamr hoon or bahut abhaari hoon ki mere kaam ko is tarah se pahchaan mili he

 1990 main, "aashaa he yah, fatve ke mutabik unhen maarane ke prayaas main muslimon ke khatre ko kam karegaa," unhone ek bayaan diya jisamen yah daawa kiya ki "unhone apni muslim aasthaa ko naveekrut kiya he, islam par apane upanyaas main hamale kii ninda kii he or duniya bhar main is dharm kii behatar samaj ke liye kaam karne ke liye patibaddhta jataayi

 unhone kaha ki jahaan "saddaam hossain ko hataane ke liye maamla banaaya janaa tha", america kaa ekatarfa sainya hastkshep anuchit tha
 As a result of the "danish cartoon case" in March 2006 - considered by many to be a sting of death threats and edicts given after the publication of The Satanic Verses in 1989 - Rushdie made a cautionary statement against the dangers of religious extremism Signed the manifesto 'together Facing the New Totalitarianism'
 The manifesto was published in 2006 in the left-leaning French weekly Charlie Hebdo

 The Home Rule Movement was the All India Home Rule League, a national political organization founded in 1916 by Bal Gangadhar Tilak with the name of "home Rule" to lead the national demand for self-government in India
 bharat ko british raaj main ek dominian kaa darja praapt karne ke liye aisa kiya gaya tha
 Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland were established as Dominions within the British Empire at that time
 pratham vishwayuddh kii armbh hone par bhartiya rashtriya congress ke narampanthiyon ne britain kii sahaayta karne kaa nishchay kiya
 The reason behind this decision of the Indian National Congress was that if India would help Britain, after the war Britain would make India independent
 parantu sheeghra hi bhartiya rashtriya congress ko ye anumaan ho gaya ki britain aisa kadaapi nahin karegaa or isliye bhartiya netaa asantusht hokar koi doosraa maarg khojane lage
 This dissatisfaction became the reason for the birth of the Home Rule Movement
 1915 i
 se 1916 i
 ke madhya do home rule ligon kii sthapana hui
 'pune Home Rule League' was founded by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and 'madras Home Rule League' was founded by Annie Besant
 home rule lig bhartiya rashtriya congress kii sahaayak sanstha kii bhaanti karyrat ho gayi
 The purpose of this movement was the attainment of self-state, but the use of weapons was not allowed in this movement
 home rule aandolan ke dauraan bal gangadhar tilak or ani besent ne 1917 main ek dhvaj banaaya
 Five red and four green stripes were made on this flag
 saat taron ko bhi is par ankit kiya gaya tha, kintu yah dhvaj logon ke bich zyada prasiddh nahin hua
 In 1920, the All India Home Rule League elected Mahatma Gandhi as its president
 ek varsh main ye sanghathan ek sanyukt bhartiya raajnneetik morche ke liye bhartiya rashtriya congress main vilay ho gaya or iskaa swayan kaa astitv khatm ho gaya
 Mrs
 Anne Besant was a resident of Ireland
 ve bharat main thiosophical sosayadi kii sanchalika thi
 She was very influenced by Indian civilization and culture
 isliye ireland ko chhodkar vah bharat main bas gai thim or bharat ko apni mathrubhumi maanane lag gai thi
 At this time, the Home Rule League was established in Ireland under the leadership of the Irish leader Redmond, who wanted to achieve home rule and self-government for Ireland by statutory and peaceful measures
 1913 main jab eni bessent england gayi to ireland kii homerul lig ne unako suzav diya ki bharat ko swatantra karaane ke liye homerul aandolan prarambh karen
 Mrs
 Anne Besant wanted to give India the same kind of swaraj as it had in other colonies of the British Empire, ie, was desirous of giving India dominion status
 isi uddeshy se bharat lautne par congress main shaamil huin or udaarvaadiyon tathaa ugravadiyon ko ektabaddh kar homerul aandolan chalaaya
 The Home Rule Movement was a statutory movement
 is aandolan ke pramukh uddeshy nimnlikhit the- Bal Gangadhar Tilak left from prison on 16 June 1914 after serving a long sentence of six years
 kaid kaa adhikansh samay mandle main beetaa tha
 When he returned to India, he felt that the country he had left had changed a lot
 swadeshi aandolan ke krantikari netaa aravind ghosh ne sanyas le liya tathaa pandicherry main rahane lage the
 Lala Lajpat Rai was in America
 bhartiya rashtriya congress surat ke vibhaajan, aandolankariyon par angrejon ke damankaaree praharon or 1909ke sanvaidhanik sudhaaron ke kaaran narampanthi rashtravaadiyon kii niraashaa ke sammilit sadame se abhi ubar nahin pai thi
 Tilak thought that first of all Congress and other extremists should be included in it
 tilak ko yah vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki bhartiya rashtriya congress, bhartiya rashtriya aandolan kaa paryaay ban chuki he or bina isaki ijaajat ke koi bhi rashtriya aandolan safal nahin ho saktaa
 With a view to persuade moderates, to win their trust and not to suppress the British rule in future, he declared "I say very clearly that we want to improve the governance system in India as in Ireland There are demanding agitators there
 angreji hukumat ko ukhaad phenkane kaa hamaara koi iraadaa nahin he
 i have no hesitation in saying that the violent incidents which have taken place in different parts of India are not only contrary to my ideology, but because of them also slowed down the process of our political development
 ’’ unhone angreji hukumat ke prati apni nishtha doharaai or bhartiya janata se apil kii ki vah sankat kii ghadi main angreji hukumat kaa saath de
 All the leaders of the moderate camp now realized that what they did in Surat in 1907 was wrong
 ye congress kii akarmanyata se bhi kshubdh the
 Tilak's appeal to him was very good
 iske alaava in par eni bessent kaa lagaataar dabaav pad rahaa tha ki desh main rashtravaadi raajnneetik aandolan ko phir se tej karo
 Anne Besant had recently joined the Congress
 1914 main vah 66 varsh kii thi, unke raajnneetik jivan kii shuruyaat england main hui thi jahaan unhone swatantra chintan ugr sudhaarwad fabianwaad or brahmavidya ke prachaar main hissaa liya
 In 1893 she came to India, the aim was to work for the Theosophical Society
 unhone madras ke ek upnagar audiar main apana daftar kholaa or 1907 main thiosaphy kaa prachaar karne lagi
 Within a short time he gained a large number of supporters
 jinamein zyaadaatar un samudaayon ke shikshit vyakti shaamil hue the, jinamein abhi tak saanskrithik punarjagran nahin hua tha
 In 1914 Anne Besant decided to expand the scope of her activities and planned a movement to demand self-government in India, like the Home Rule League of Ireland
 unhen laga ki iske liye congress kii anumati or garampanthi aandolankariyon kaa sahyog lenaa jaruri he
 To get the support of the extremists, it was necessary to include them in the Congress
 eni bessent congress ke garampanthi netaaon ko samajhane lagi ki ve tilak va uske garampanthi sahyogiyon ko congress main shaamil hone kii ijaajat de de
 But the Congress session of 1914 dented his efforts
 firozshah mehta or bombay ke unke narampanthi samarthakon ne gokhale or bengal ke narampanthiyon ko, garampanthiyon ko baahar rakhane ke liye manaa liya
 After this, Tilak and Anne Besant decided to run a political movement on their own and at the same time they continued to pressurize the Congress to make the extremists their members again
 1915 ke shuru main eni bessent ne do akhabaaron ‘new india’ or ‘kaaman vil’ ke madhyam se aandolan ched diya
 Organized public meetings and conferences
 unki maang thi ki jis tarah se gore upniveshon main vahaan kii janata ko apni sarkaar banane kaa adhikaar diya gaya he, bharatiya janata ko bhi swashaasan kaa adhikaar mili
 After April 1915, Anne Besant took an even tougher and combative attitude
 isi bich lokmaanya tilak ne apni raajnneetik gatividhiyaan shuru kar di
 But he was very cautious that the moderate faction of the Congress should not be angry or the Congress should not feel that Tilak's activities did not match with the Congress policy
 unki dili khwaahish congress main kisi tarah shaamil hone kii thi
 Tilak convened a conference of his supporters in Poona in 1915, in which it was decided that an institution be formed to familiarize the rural masses with the objectives and activities of the Congress
 is faisle ke baad usee varsh agast or sitambar main maharashtra ke vibhinn nagaron main jo sthaneey sanghathan bane, ve raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko tej karne ke bajaay sari urja congress main ekta sthapit karne ke liye kharch karte rahe
 He continued to insist that unity in the Congress is very important for any national movement
 narampanthi congress ke kuch roodhiwaadiyon par dabaav daalane ke liye tilak ne kabhi-kabhi dhamkee kaa bhi sahaara liya, par unhen vishwaas tha ki adhiktar narampanthi netaaon ko vah samajha-bujhaakar manaa lenge
 The annual Congress session was held in December 1915 and the efforts of Tilak and Anne Besant succeeded
 garampanthiyon ko congress main waapas lene kaa faisla kiya gaya
 The opposition of Bombay moderates proved ineffective after the death of Ferozeshah Mehta
 gokhale kaa nidhan ho chukaa tha
 Anne Besant was successful in bringing the extremists to the Congress, but could not get the approval of the Congress and the Muslim League on her proposal for the formation of the Home Rule League
 lekin sthaneey str par congress samitiyon ko punerjeevit karne ke liye prachaar kaaryon ke unke prastaavon ko congress ne maan liya lekin unhen us samay kii congress kaa charitra or uski takat kaa pataa tha
 She knew that the Congress had approved these programs, but it would not implement it
 isliye unhone apane prastaav ke saath yah shart bhi rakhi thi ki yadi sitambar 1916 tak congress in kaaryakramon par amal nahin karegi to vah khud apana sanghathan bana legi
 Tilak got the right to return to Congress and did not make any promise to Congress, so he announced the formation of the 'homerule League' at the provincial conference in Belgaum in April 1916
