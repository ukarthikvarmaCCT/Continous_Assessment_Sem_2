 uski katha kuch is prakaar prachlit he - dwarika main shri krishna rukmini aadi raaj mahishiyon ke saath shayan karte hue ek raat nidra main achaanak radhe-radhe bol pade
 The nobles were surprised

 Mother Rohini was well aware of the mysterious Raas Leelas with Radha's Shri Krishna
 unase jaankaree praapt karne ke liye sabhi maharaniyon ne anunay-vinay kii
 At first, Mata Rohini wanted to be postponed but after the Maharanis stubbornly said, okay
 suno, subhadra ko pehle pehre par bitha do, koi andar na aane paae, bhale hi balram yaa shrikrishna hi kyon na hon
 As soon as the story of Mata Rohini started, Shri Krishna and Balram suddenly appeared towards the inner end

 He laid a condition for making the idol that no one should come in the house where i will make the idol until the idol is fully built
 raja ne ise maan liya
 Today, in a house near the place where Sreejgannathji's temple is located, he got engaged in building the idol
 raja ke parivarajanon ko yah gyaat na tha ki vah vruddh badhai koun he
 When the door of the house remained closed for several days, the queen thought that how could the carpenter work without eating and drinking
 ab tak vah jivit bhi hoga yaa mar gaya hoga
 The Empress made the Maharaja aware of his innate doubts
 maharaja ke dwaar khulwaane par vah vruddh badhai kahin nahin mila lekin uske dwaara ardhnirmit shri jagannatha, subhadra tathaa balram kii kashtha murtiyan vahaan par mili
 The Maharaja and the Empress became unhappy
 lekin usee kshan donon ne akashwani suni, 'vyarth du:khee mat ho, ham isi rup main rahanaa chaahate hai murtiyon ko dravya aadi se pavitra kar sthapit karvaa do
 'even today, those incomplete and obscure idols are embellished and revered in Purushottam Puri's Rath Yatra and temple

 aise rath rupi sharir main aatma rupi bhagwaan jagannatha virajman hote hai
 In this way, the Rath Yatra indicates the union of body and soul and motivates us to maintain self-realization
 rathyatra ke samay rath kaa sanchaalan aatma yukt sharir karti he jo jivan yatra kaa pratik he
 Although there is a soul in the body, it does not operate on its own, but it conducts that illusion
 isi prakaar bhagwaan jagannatha ke virajman hone par bhi rath swayan nahin chalata balki use khinchne ke liye lok-shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Like all the major festivals of Holi, Diwali, Dussehra, Raksha Bandhan, Eid, Christmas, Baisakhi all over India, the festival of Puri's Rath Yatra is also important
 puri kaa pradhan parv hote hue bhi yah rathyatra parv puure bharatvarsh main lagbhag sabhi nagaron main shraddha or prem ke saath manaaya jaataa he
 Those who are unable to attend Puri's Rath Yatra are definitely involved in their city's Rath Yatra
 rathyatra ke is mahotsav main jo saanskrithik or puranic drishy upasthit hota he use praaia: sabhi deshvasi sauhardra, bhai-chaare or ekta ke pariprekshya main dekhte hai
 The reverence and devotion with which everyone sits in the temple of Puri and receive the Mahaprasad of Shri Jagannathji together, automatically reflects the importance of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
 utsaahpurvak shri jagannatha ji kaa rath khinchakar log apane aapako dhanya samajhate hai
 This Rath Yatra of Shri Jagannathpuri is seen as an important link of cultural unity and easy harmony

 pustak main aage likhaa he ki liyanardo jo ki diu ke darbar main shahi kalakaar the, isabela ke kaaphi nikat the
 About 8 years ago, a doctor of teeth in Japan surprised everyone by saying that the secret of Monalisa's mysterious smile is the break of the two front teeth in her upper jaw and that is why her upper lip was pressed on one side
 -this is visible, that is why one of his upper lips is seen as something suppressed from one side

 twodel swanim ko amoort kaalpanik ikai maanate hai
 Swan or sound-change do not always mean change, while phonem-change is sure to mean change
 swanim uccharit bhashaa kii aisi laghuttam ikai he, jisase do dhvaniyon kaa antar spasht hota he
 Thus it is also clear that phonemes is related to sound
 dhwani kaa sambandh yadi uccharan se hota he, to shravan se bhi iskaa atoot sambandh hota he
 If the sound is not heard then its existence will also be doubtful
 dhwani ke uccharan tathaa shravan-sambandhon ke hi kaaran swanim ko sharir-vigyaan tathaa bhautik vigyaan se sambandhit kaha gaya he, kyonki uccharan or shravan-prakriya yadi sharir vigyaan se sambandhit hoti he, to sanvahan-prakriya purnatah bhautik vigyaan se

 The difference between the sounds is displayed through the phoneme itself
 ja, na, pa bhinn-bhinn swanim hai

 Here 'H' and 'P' are two different meaningful sounds
 inhen bhinn sarthak dhvaniyon ke aadhaar par ‘gyaan’ tathaa ‘paan’ main arth bhinnata bhi he
 These meaningful sounds are called phonemes in phonology
 un do shabdo kii 'na' dhvaniyon main sookshm antar he, kyonki koi bhi vyakti yadi ek dhwani ko do baar uccharan karegaa, to unamem sookshm antar hona swaabhaavik he; yatha- paan, jaan, pani, manu, minu, maane, maano aadi shabdon kii vibhinn ‘na’ dhvaniyon main saamaanya rup se koi antar nahin lagata he, kintu sookshm chintan par in dhvaniyon main sookshm bhinnata kaa gyaan hota he
 If there is a difference in them phonetically, then there is a sufficient similarity in the concept of phonemes on the basis of the place, effort and reason of pronunciation
 swanim rekhankan ke liye is prakaar kaa aadhaar apanaate hai- camel ko / k / m / l When there is no change of meaning even when there is difference in sound, it is called free distribution
 hindi main swanim ke aise prayog mil jate hai; yatha- diwaar > diwathall, gam > gam
 Here the whole environment is the same except for the / r / - / l in the first word and / c / - / c / in the second word
 iske liye ~ chinh kaa prayog karte hai; yatha- diwaar > diwaal / r / ~ / l
 If there is a change of meaning when used in the beginning, middle and end of a word, the phonemes form becomes fixed; For example, by using 'h' in the beginning and end of the word 'you', the meaning-changed forms are found in this way - is prakaar 'ja' swanim he
 'L' can show phonemes as follows - pravartit dhwani keval aadi main he, iske arth main parivartan bhi nahin hota
 Lastly, it is not phoneme
