 aam nimh or nicd punah charge karne yogya badariyon kaa ek ucch swat: anavesh dar hota he jo unhen dhune vaale detectaron main upyog ke liye anupyukt bana detaa he
 This is true although they can provide much more power than alkaline batteries when used in portable stereos, just after charging
 iske alaava, punah charge badariyon ke saath ek samasya unke upyogi charge ke ant main voltage main teji se kami hona he
 This is a concern in devices such as smoke detectors, because the battery can "charge" from "charged" so fast that the low-battery warning period from the detector is either so short that it is ignored
 Or they do not occur at all

 In 2004, NIST released a comprehensive report concluding that other items included "smoke alarms with ionization type or photoelectric type giving residents consistent time to escape most fires in homes" and "earlier Consistent with the findings, ionization-type alarms produced better responses than photoelectric alarms in case of a blazing fire
 Provide and photoelectric alarms looked forward to ionization type alarms in the event of fire smoldering considerably faster response
 enepapie gharon main upyog kiye jane vaale alarmon ko har 10 varshon par badalane kii joardaar salaah detaa he
 Smoke alarms become less reliable over time, mainly due to the aging of their electronic devices, which makes them susceptible to troublesome false alarms

 All smoke detectors must be directly connected to electrical wires, interconnected and have a battery backup
 In addition, smoke detectors are required within or outside each sleeping room depending on local regulations
 baahar lage smoke detector aag kaa adhik shighrata se pataa kar sakate hai, yah maanate hue ki aag sone ke kamare se shuru nahin hogi lekin alarm kii aawaaj kam ho jaaegi or yah kuch logon ko jagaa nahin paaegi
 kuch kshetron main seedhi margon, mukhya galiyaaron evam gairaajon main bhi smoke detectaron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wired units with a third "interconnected" wire allow a dozen or more detectors to be connected so that if one detects smoke the alarm will ring across all the detectors in the network, which increases this probability It will allow residents to be alerted, even if they are inside a closed door or the alarm is set one or two floors away from their place
 Wired interconnection can be practical to use only in new construction, especially if the wire needs to be moved to areas where it cannot be reached without piercing walls or roofs
 2000 ke dashak ke madhya tak, zigbi jaise takneekon kaa istemaal kar wireles ke dwaara network kiye hue smoke alarmon ke kshetra main vikaas shuru ho chukaa he, jo aapas main jude hue alarmon ko mahange taar lagaae bina imaarat main aasaani se pun:sthapit karne kii anumati pradaan karegaa

 yah faisla kiya gaya ki sirf maanak se unke patent kaa ulanghan nahin ho rahaa he, balki yah ki yadi tag ko ek vishesh tareeke se padhanaa he to ho saktaa he ki Intermec ko kuch roylty kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 The EPC Gen2 standard was adopted as ISO 18000-6C in 2006 with minor modifications

 Nevertheless, the upcoming conversion and design of the existing Gen 2 protocol standard, from the inlays in the useful RFID label and the overall final cost will increase, especially with the expansion of additional security measures for RFID supply chain object-level tagging

 The frequencies used for RFID in the United States are currently inconsistent with frequencies in Europe or Japan
 iske alaava, ubharta hua koi maanak abhi tak barcode ke samaan vyapak nahin ban paaya he
 a primary concern regarding RFID security is the illegal tracking of RFID tags
 tag, jo vaishvik rup se pathneey hai, ve nijee sthaan gopneeyata or korporate / sainya suraksha, donon ke liye khatra paidaa kar rahe hai
 Such concerns have been raised by the US Department of Defense recently adopting the RFID tag for supply chain management

 Depending on the design, epcglobal Network is also vulnerable to dos attacks

 Any organization planning to get started with epcglobal Network will be stifled upon knowing that the infrastructure of epcglobal Network has the same security vulnerabilities as DNS
 raksha kii ek dwitiya shrenee, tag chloning ko rokane ke liye kryptography kaa upyog karti he
 Some tags use a type of "rolling code" scheme, in which tag identifier information is changed after each scan, thus reducing the usefulness of observed responses
 adhik parishkrut upkaran chunauti-pratikriya pramanikaran main sanlagn hote hai jahaan tag, reader ke saath soochna kaa aadan pradaan karata he
 In these protocols, secret tag information is not sent over the unprotected communication channel between the tag and the reader
 balki, reader tag ke liye ek chunauti jari karata he, jo ek parinaam ke saath jawaab detaa he jisaki gananaa kuch gupt mulya ke saath bandhe kryptographic circuit kaa upyog karte hue kii jaati he
 Such protocols may be based on symmetric or public key cryptography

 This cost / power binding prompted some manufacturers to place encrypted tags using significantly weaker or proprietary encryption schemes, which do not necessarily prevent a sophisticated attack

 There are conflicting views about whether aluminum can prevent the reading of the RFID chip
 kuch logon kaa daawa he ki aluminium parirakshan, jo multah ek farade pinjre kaa nirmaan karata he, bilkul kaam karata he
 Others claim that just wrapping an RFID card in aluminum foil only hinders further transmission, so it is not effective at stopping it altogether
 parirakshan, phir ek prayukt kii ja rahi frequency kaa kaary he
 Low frequencies lowfid tags, such as those used in implantable devices for humans and pets, are relatively resistant to shielding, although thick metal foil will prevent most reading
 hai frequency highfid tag parirakshan ke prati samvedansheel hai or jab ye kisi dhaatu kii sataha ke kuch centimetre ke andar hote hai to inhen padhanaa mushkil hota he
 UHF ultra-highfid tags are difficult to read when they are placed within a few millimeters of a metal surface, although their reading range actually increases when they are placed 2–4 cm from a metal and is the reason for the tag

 The concerns raised by the above can be partially overcome by the use of clipped tags
 clip tag, ek RFID tag he jise upabhokta gopneeyata ko badhaane ke liye dizine kiya gaya he
 The clipped tag has been suggested by IBM researchers, Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth
 bikri ke baad, upabhokta tag ke ek hisse ko ukhaad saktaa he
 This allows the conversion of a long-range tag to a closer tag that can still be read, but only at shorter distances - less than a few inches or a centimeter
 tag ke is sanshodhan kii aankhon se dekhakar pushti kii ja sakati he
 This tag can later be used for return, snooze, or recycling
 baharhaal, pathan seemaa, reader or tag, donon kaa hi ek kaary he
 Improvements in technology can increase the reading range of tags
 reader ke tag ke bahut paas hone se kam duuri ke tag pathneey ho jate hai
 Typically, the reading range of a tag is limited to the distance from the reader at which the tag can draw enough energy from the reader area to control the tag
 ek reader kii shakti ko badhaakar, tag ko unke liye niyat duuri se adhik dur se padhaa ja saktaa he
 The limit on the reading distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal sent back from the tag to the reader

 The Greek alphabet is a twenty four letter system using which the Greek language is being written since the eighth century BC
 prayek swar evam vyanjan liye pruthak chinh vaali yah pehali evam pracheenatam varnmaala he
 This alphabet originated from the Phoenician alphabet and many of Europe's alphabets originate from it
 angrezi likhane ke liye prayukt roman lipi tathaa roosi bhashaa likhane ke liye prayog kii jane vaali sirilik varnmaala donon unani lipi se janmi hai
 After the second century BCE, mathematicians also started using Greek letters to represent numbers
 unani varnon kaa prayog vigyaan ke kai kshetron main kiya jaataa he, jaise bhautikee main tatwon ke naam, sitaron ke naam, birdari evam saathi sampradaay ke naam, ooshna katibandheey chakravaaton ke naam ke liye
 The emergence of the Greek alphabet centuries after the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and after the disuse of the earlier Greek writing system, the Linear b script, in the eighth century BC
 Happened in the middle of rekhiy bi kaa udbhav rekhiy e se hua jo ki minoai sabhyataa dwaara viksit thi, jinaki bhashaa unani se sambandhit nahin thi, parinamswaroop minoai aksharmala unani bhashaa kii dhvaniyon ke lipyantaran hetu adarsh madhyam uplabdh nahin karaatin
 The Greek alphabet prevailing today developed after the Greek dark period, that is, the decline of the Mycenaean civilization and the rise of ancient Greece, which was about 800 BC
 It was the time between the epics of Homer and the beginning of the ancient Olympic Games in 776 BC
 dhvanyatmak phonishian varnmaala ke ek anukalan ke rup main, iskaa sabase ullekhneey parivartan, swar aksharon kaa samaveshan he, jiske bina unani apthaneey hoti
 Vowel signs were not originally used in the Semitic alphabet
 purvavarti pashchimi simitic lipi parivaar main, ek avishisht swar ke saath vyanjan hetu ek akshar hameshaa prayukt kiya gaya
 This did not reduce readability as the word in semitic languages is based on triaxial roots that explain meaning only by the presence of consonants and vowels are clarified by context
 vipareet, unani ek bhaaropee bhashaa he atah swar main antar arth main bada antar paidaa karata he
 Therefore, the Greek alphabet divided the letters into two categories - vowels and consonants, where a consonant must be used with a vowel to become an accentable unit

 In Eastern Greek, which lacked complete pronunciation, the semitic glottal consonant / ħ / ka h) was also used for long vowels / ɛː / and finally Ω) The letter began to be used for long / ɔː / 
 The reason for the inclusion of long open letters e and o lies in oral morphological study of the language

 Science fiction is the genre of fictional literature that gives narrative expression to the human reaction arising out of possible changes in science and technology
 meri shelli kii 'da francanstein' pehali vigyaan kathatmak kriti maani jaati he
 In the past century in America and Britain, there have been better science fiction stories - Isaac Azimov, Arthur C
 Clarke, Robert Heinlein have been famous science fiction writers
 ab teenon divangat hai
 When Devaki Nandan Khatri, the father of Aiyari and Tilasmi novels in Hindi, appeared in Hindi along with Chandrakanta, it was usually during that period that Ambika Dutt Vyas's wonder wonder-story also created a new array of science fiction writing in Hindi
 ‘piyus pravaah’ patrika main 1884-88 ke madhya dharawahik rup se iskaa prakaashan ho chukaa tha
 The 'wonder story' was purely a science fiction, completely free from mischievous and espionage influences
 udhar bangla bhashaa main "panch kaudi de" jab jasusi sahitya- ‘ghatana-ghatatope’, ‘jai-paraajay’, ‘jivan rahasy’, ‘nil vasana sundari’, ‘mayavi’, ‘-ke nirmaan main pravrutt the to usee kaal main vigyaan kathaayen bhi likhi ja rahi thi, balki kahana yah chahie ki bangala main vigyaan galp kaa unmesh isse purv ho chukaa tha
 Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose, an analyst of life in plants and inventor of wireless, wrote the first Bengali science fiction titled 'storm over Victory' in 1897 itself
 anadidhan binraji ne ‘van kusum’, ‘champa phool’, ‘chor’ jaise upanyaason ke saath saath ‘mangal grah’ jaisaa vigyaan galp bhi prastut kiya
 In Marathi, Sridhar Balakrishna Ranade wrote the first science fiction titled 'tareche Humor' in 1915
 praayah isi samay nath madhav ne ‘shrinivas raav’ naamak vaigyanik upanyaas marathi main prastut kiya
 The Hindu readership of Devaki Nandan Khatri created in the backdrop of the Aranyas of Mirzapur, the Hindi readers were astonished and bemused and he took Khatri ji hands
 khanni pranit ‘narendramohini’ ‘virendra vir’, ‘chandrakanta santati’, ‘kusum kumari’, ‘naulakha haar’, ‘guptagodana’ 
 ‘kaagaj kii kothri’ ‘anuthi begum’, ‘bhootnath’ ne lokapriyata kii sari hadein paar kar leen
 The magic of Indrajal of Devaki Nandan Khatri started to speak on the head of the readers
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne ‘hindi sahitya kaa itihaas’ main likhaa he ki khatri ke tilsmi sahitya kaa anand lene ke liye urdubhashiyon ne hindi sikhi
 It was like Khatri's dark world! pathak hi kya, samakaleen lekhak bhi is jaadu ke mohpash main aabaddh hue bina na rah sake
 Then meaningful efforts to create Tilasmi literature started and such things started coming out in a surprising amount and the Hindi readers got wet in it
 is kaal khand main aise lekhakon kii samrudh parampara dikhaai padati he
 Devi Prasad Upadhyay's 'maya-vilas', Jagannath Chaturvedi's 'vasant-malati', Hare Krishna Johar's 'kusum Lata', 'terrible Love', Saraswati Gupta's 'rajkumar', Bal Mukunda Varma's 'kamini', Rajendra Mohini , Hare Krishna Johar Kriti 'vampire', 'manayak-mohini', 'magician' and 'kamal Kumari', Madan Mohan Pathak Kriti 'anand Sundari', Munni Lal Khanni Krita Bahadur ', Hare Krishna Johar Krita' Nirala Masked 'and' terrible blood ', that Rori Lal Goswami wrote 'two-piece of cut mud', Vishweshwar Prasad Varma, 'virendra Kumar', Kishori Lal Goswami, 'yakuti Takhti', Ram Lal Varma's 'putlimahal', Roop Kishore Jain's 'surya Kumar Sambhav' Etc
 are representative works of this literature
 aage bhi yah parampara chalati rahi lekin yaheen se tilsmi sahitya kaa praayah avsaan mana janaa chahie
 It is also a strange coincidence that along with Tilasmi literature, there was a sudden flood of espionage and readers were appreciated and adopted
 hindi main jasusi upanyaason ke prenta gopal ram gahamri hai
 After a brief period of 'chandrakanta' and 'narendra Mohini' of Devaki Nandan Khatri, 'awesome Corpse' and 'detective' also emerged together
 in jasusi upanyaason kii badhati lokapriyata se prerit hokar gahamri ne prabhoot maatra main aisa sahitya rachaa-‘bekasoor kii faansee’, ‘sarakati laash’, ‘khooni koun he ?’, ‘begunaah kaa khun’, ‘jamuna kaa khun’, ‘dabl jasoos’, ‘mayavini’, ‘jaaduugarani manorama’ 1901), ‘ladki chori’, ‘jasoos kii bhul’, ‘thana kii chori’, bhanyakar chori’, ‘andhe kii aankh’, ‘jaal raja’, ‘jaali kaaka’, ‘jasoos kii chori,, ‘malgodaam main chori’, ‘daake par daaka’, ‘doctor kii kahani’, ‘ghar kaa bhedi’, ‘jasoos par jasoos’, ‘devi singh’ 
 ‘ladkaa gaayab’, ‘jasoos chakkar main ’, ‘khooni kaa bhed’, ‘bhojpur kii thangi’ 
 ‘balihaari buddhi’, ‘yoga mahima’ or ‘guptbhed’ aadi
 Even contemporary Hindi writers could not keep themselves afloat due to the influence of detective literature, and many such compositions came out during this period
 yatha-rudradutt sharma krit ‘var singh daaroga’, ‘kishori laal goswami krit ‘jinde kii laash’, ‘jairam gupt krit ‘langadaa khooni’, jang bahadur singh krit ‘vicitra khun’ sher singh krit ‘vilakshan jasoos’, ‘chandrashekhar pathak krit ‘amir ali thang’, ‘shashi bala’ or shiv narayan dvivedi krit ‘amar dutt’ aadi
 But this tradition ends here
 kaaran yah ki hindi main yah parampara naveen thi or angl sahitya se purnatah prabhavit
 The reader quickly got bored of it due to not conforming to the Indian environment
 pathakon kii aruchi ne tilsmi, aiyaari or jasusi sahitya kaa achir main hi garbhalopan bhi kar diya
 With the landing of Premchand, the screen was completely transformed
 1917-18 ke aas-paas tilsmi or jasusi sahitya nepathy main chale gayi
 In the thirties of the twentieth century, psychological and phenomenal novels knocked
 pathakvarg nayepan kii talash main tha
 He wanted to get rid of formulaic literature
 aise main kishori laal goswami ke ‘gupt godana’ ne sanjivani kaa kaam kiya
 This is an epic novel

 While Vishwambhar Nath Sharma presented a cosmic novel called 'turk Taruni', Bhagwati Charan Verma made Wajid Ali Shah's luxury in 'fall' the basis of his narrative
 rishabhcharan kaa ‘gadar’ hindi upanyaason main ek nayi karavat kaa pratik he
 Vrindavanlal Varma carried this tradition forward
 unhone ‘virata kii padmini’ or ‘gadhn kundar’ jaise aitihaasik upanyaason ke srijan ke liye bundelkhand ke bhukhando, samskruti or vahaan ke veeron ke paraspar vaimnasy, prem-prasangon ko apana aadhaar banaaya
 The 'cane' of Krishna Nand Gupta is also a creation of this category
 bhagwati charan verma ne ‘chitralekha’ main paap or punya kii vishad vyakhya kii
 Premchand's 'durgadas' and Chatur Sen Shastri's 'rana Raj Singh' made aiyari-tilasmi-espionage literature a contradiction, and this tradition ended there
 hindi kii vigyaan kathaon ke bare main likhte samay log praayah keshav prasad singh kii ‘chandralok kii yatra’ kaa pratham vigyaan galp ke rup main ullekh karte hai
 So far there is such a view

 Under vector algebra, the sum, multiplication etc
 of vector zodiacs are studied
 yadi trivim eucalidia spes main ek sadish a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a} }}} = a1e1 + a2e2+ a3e3 he, to sadish kaa pariman nimnlikhit rup se gyaat kiya jaayegaa- In addition, the value of that vector can be derived by taking the square root of the magnitude of the scalar product of a vector from a vector amount>
 mana ki a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a} }}} =a1e1 + a2e2 + a3e3 aban b → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {b} }}} =b1e1 + b2e2 + b3e3, haijahan e1, e2, e3 lamb ikai sadish hai
 Then the sum of a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a xxrep 4 } and b → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {b xxrep 4 } will be as follows- yadi The difference between vector a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a xxrep 4 } and b → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {b xxrep 4 } will be as follows- kisi sadishon ko do yaa do se adhik sadishon ke yoga ke rup main nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 Obviously this can be done in infinite ways
 kintu kisi diye hue sadish ko kinhin do dishaao main viyojan maatr ek prakaar se hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Often the two directions are mutually perpendicular as shown in the figure
 ek sadish ko ek adish se guna kiya jaay to parinaam ek sadish hoga jo purvokt sadish kii disha main hoga
 For example, if a vector a → { \ displaystyle { \ overrightarrow { \ mathbf {a xxrep 4 } is multiplied by a scalar, the product will be - punah do sadishon kaa adish yaa dot gunanfal ek adish raashi hoti he
 The dot product of two vectors is defined as follows- kisi tribhuj kii do sanlagn bhujaayen kram se do sadishon ko nirupit karen to tribhuj kii teesri bhujaa vipareet kram main in do sadishon kaa yoga nirupit karegi
 If more than two vectors are decorated in such a way that the top of the first vector has the foot of the second vector and the head of the second has the foot of the third, then the sum of all these vectors is equal to the vector joining the foot of the first vector from the top of the last vector
 Will happen

 Longinus is traditionally believed to be the creator of a work called "sublime element in poetry"
 is kriti main achche lekhan ke prabhaavon kii charchaa he
 The real name of Longinus is not known
 vah unani kavyalochan kaa shikshak tha
 Its period is estimated to be from the first to the third century
 lonzinus ne kavy ko shreshth banane vaale tatwon par vichaar karte hue is siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 He considers the sublime as the element that makes poetry better and the poet the prestige
 yah udaatt mahaan vichaaron sangathit alankaar yojana, abhijatya pad rachana tathaa prabhaav kii garima main nihit he
 They consider Vagadambara Baleta and Bhavadambara as obstructing elements
 jis prakaar bhartiya kavyashastra main kavy ke swaroop or uski aatma ko lekar vibhinn maton kaa pratipaadan hua he usee prakaar paashchaatya aalochana ke kshetra main vibhinn yugon main vibhinn chintakon ne kavy yaa sahitya ke mul tatva kii khoj kii he
 Plato considered simulation to be the core of literature
 inkaa pallavan arestu ne apni drushti se kiya or virechan ko sahitya kaa uddeshy sweekaar kiya
 Similarly, Longinus has a sublime theory
 is siddhanth ke dwaara unhone yah spasht kiya he ki koi bhi kalakriti yaa kavyakruti bina udaatt tatva ke shreshth rachana nahin ho sakati
 The best is the one who has deep thoughts and feelings of the Creator
 rachanaakaar kaa yah anubhuti tatva apni mahanata, udaattata, bhavyata yaa garima ke kaaran rachana ko mahaan banaata he
 Creation or creation gets expression through craft; But the author of the sublime work tries not to worry too much about the beauty of the craft in his creation, to strengthen the feeling contained in it
 is udaatt siddhanth ko prastut karanevaale acharya lonzinus he
 His Greek language name is Longinus and in English language is pronounced 'longinus'
 inaki rachana kaa naam ‘perihutsus’ he, jiskaa angreji main ‘on da sablim’ naam se anuwaad kiya gaya
 This is what is called the sublime in Hindi
 iskaa granth paashchaatya sahitya-shaastra kaa pramukh granth he
 Lonaginus's definition of the sublime and its general introduction as it appears that the term had become so prevalent in his time that he felt no need to give it a detailed introduction
 phir bhi udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karte hue unhone itnaa kaha- That is, the name of the distinctiveness and superiority of the expression is sublime
 isi ko lakshya karke hindi aalochakon ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki kisi rachana main udaatt tatva upyukt tathaa garimapurna shabd-vidhaan, aaveg ko deept karne vaali alankaar yojana tathaa rachana-vidhaan dwaara abhivyakt hota he
 Longinus described the sublime of poetry as distinct from speech, because in poetry the effect of sublime on the audience is in the form of subjectivity, not as enforcement
 is kaaran lonzinus kii drushti main bhavy kavita vahiin he jo anandatirek ke kaaran hamen itnaa nimagn or tanmay kar de ki ham aisi ucch bhav-bhoomi par pahunch jaae jahaan varnya vishay vidyut-prakaash kii bhanti aalokit ho uthta he
 From this point of view, Longinus can be seen to have a lot of equanimity in the thawed-vedhyantar of Anandatirek and Vishwanath
 udaatt ke swaroop ke antargat lonzinus main manovaigyanik or vyavhaarik donon drushtiyon ko saamne rakhaa
 This is why he has mentioned the internal elements of the sublime on one side and has also discussed its external side
 udaatt mul aadhaar kya he? kya vah vaktaa yaa lekhak kii janmajaat pratibha par aadhaarit hota he yaa uskaa prasphuton shiksha-diksha se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he yaa abhyaas par nirbhar he? in prashnon par vichaar karte hue lonzinus ne madhya maarg kaa anukaran kiya he
 Sublime to his view is neither genius relative to all nor relative to practice
 vastutah udaatt kaa aadhaar vyakti kaa koi ek paksh, ek gun yaa ek pravriti nahin he apitu uske peeche sampoorn vyaktitv kii jhalak hoti he
 Therefore, the creation of a sublime can be a sublime personality
 mahaan pratibhashali ucch vidwaan evam yashasvi charitravaan vyakti hi udaatt yaa udghoshak ho saktaa he
 According to Longinus - "sublime is a reflection of the greatness of the soul
" sachcha udaatt keval unheen main prapya he jinaki chetana udaatt evam vicasonmukh he
 It is quite natural that the words of those whose minds are full of lofty perceptions can be echoed by lofty words
 ’’ In this way, the sublime is concerned not only with the study of talent, study and language, but with the entire personality of the person
 nishkarshtah Its effect is not gradual, incidental and the narrative shines through its unique light
 yadhyapi udaatt ke muladhar sahityakar ke vyaktitv kii mahanata main nihit he phir bhi rachana main udaatt kaa tatva laane main liye lonzinus ne paanch sroton kii charchaa kii he- Out of the above five elements, the first two are part of the birthright ie poet-talent and the remaining three are art related features
 udaatt ke stroton main pratham sthaan vichaar kii mahatta kaa he
 This is what Loninus also called the grandeur of the soul by word
 unka spasht kathan he- ‘‘udaatt mahaan kii aatma kii pratidhwani hota he
 "if this importance of the soul is not natural then it can be achieved by excellent ideas
 mahaan shabd unheen ke mukh se nikalate hai jinamein vichaar gambheer or gahan hon
 Only rich writers with great ideas can create sublime
 lonzinus kii yah aisi avadharana he, jisase unki udaatt-prabhaav sambandhi dharna bhi judi hui hai
 The effect of the sublime is atrophy, not persuasion
 yah dharna is baat ko visheshikrut karti hai ki atmaati kraman bhavy or mahaan vichaaron kii garimamayi abhivyakti se hi sambhav he
 In fact, spiritual greatness is the first condition of sublime creation, that is why the effect of sublime will also be considered morally welfare
 is prakaar udaatt sahitya kaa prabhaav naitik tathaa kalatmak donon hi drushtiyon se uttam mana janaa chahie
 From this point of view, Longinus and Grandmother Milton descend on the same level
 milton ke anusaar mahaan sahityakar banane ke liye mahaan or ati sammanneey vastuon kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 Milton's view is- manasviyon ko yah bhavy vaani sahaj hi praapt ho jaati hai
 Sometimes it happens that the talented poet cools down like the sun setting in the evening of his life and the lack of sublime appears in his later poetry
 odisi main homer kii isi astachal-gamini pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 Longinus states - "elliot is Homer's creation of youthfulness, because it has the essence of motion and struggle
 iske vipareet, odissi kaa bahulansh aakhyanatmak hai, jo budhaape kii dein he
 "vishnu Priya" and "ratnavali" of Maithilisharan Gupta in Hindi are similar poems, in which the brilliance of their talent can be seen
 pant or bachchan kaa parvarti kavy bhi iskaa udhaaharan hai
 Longinus emphasizes the imperative of boisterous impulses in the artwork, as it is necessary for the work to be great to provide emotional stimulation to the readers
 bhavavesh yaa bhavy aaveg ve hen jinase ‘aatma’ apane aap upar uthne lagati hai or phir harshollas se bhar jaati hai
 Longinus has created two classes of impulses — one grand and the other inferior
 bhavy aavegon main ucch bhavavesh arthath utkrisht bhaavana prabalya, aadar, vismay, ullas or shaury aadi kii gananaa karte hai, jabaki nimna aavegon kaa sambandh karunaa, shok or bhay se he
 To fill the sublime in poetry, the eclipse of high emotion and low emotion should be discarded
 lonzinus kaa mat he ki alankaaron kaa prayog is kushalta se hona chahie ki is baat par kisi kaa dhyaan na jaae ki vah alankaar he
 When art is used skillfully, it loses its beauty and its configuration of miracles
 vastutah alankaar kii chamatkrit na karen, apitu vah anand hetuk hona chahie
 Longinus considered superlative ornaments to be sublime
 unke anusaar vistaarna, shapathokti, prashnalankar, viparyay, vyatikram, punrariti, pratyakshikaran, sanchay, saar, rup-parivartan, paryyokti, atishyokti aadi alankaaron main udaatt vidyaman rahata hai
 Therefore, it is necessary for the sublime to be spontaneous and justified
 udaahranarth Longineus by poetic expression means poetic language
 unhone bhashaa kii utkrushtataa par vishesh bal diya he; kyonki udaatt kii abhivyakti bhashaa ke madhyam se hoti he
 It is imperative to have a proper, appropriate effect and syllogism of the phrase, because by using energetic language, the creator can create a work that has a bad effect
 upyukt or prabhavi shabdaawalee ke dwaara rachana main bhavyata, garima, oj, madev, shakti aadi gunon kaa samavesh or jeevantata kaa sanchaar hota he
 Rachna-vidhan means symmetric word-plan or word plan in a certain order
 lonzinus ke anusaar vibhinn tattvon kaa parsparik saamanjasy kriti ko garimapurna banaata he
 Just as there is no importance for the different elements of the body to remain independent, the creation of the entire body is possible only when it is found, in the same way, the creation of a dignified work is done by the combination of all the elements
 rachana ke sabhi tatva milakar jab saamanjasy kii shrinkhalaa main bandh jate hai, tabhi un main udaatt aata he
 Otherwise it falls apart
 kabhi-kabhi rachana-tattvon kaa saamanjasy us kshati kii aapurti kar detaa he, jo rachana ke kisi vishesh tatva-dosha se utpann hoti he or is prakaar yah saamanjasy udaatt-prabhaav ko akshunn banaaye rakhata he
 Therefore, the dignified and magnificent composition-law is also the nutrient of sublime-creation
 lonzinus ne udaatt ke virdohi tattvon par bhi vichaar kiya he
 He has considered balata, unrestrained vagvistar, chaotic pedagogy, inferior words, mood and rhetoric, unwanted brevity, unnecessary decor, excessive emphasis on music and rhythm, etc
 as the antithesis of sublime
 atah shreshth kavi ko apni rachana main inhen sthaan nahin dena chahie
 This is a major flaw of the genre
 ‘baley’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘bachakaana’
 Just as agility, numbness, lightness and shortness are found in children, baldness will be considered in that style
 jisamen bina sanyam ke vagsfiti kii jaae, kshudra arth dyotak shabdon kaa prayog ho or chanchal yaa asthir pad-vinyas paaya jaae
 The style becomes artificial in this
 lonzinus ke anusaar- Use of ornate and heavy words in the absence of dignity of feeling
 jaise griddha jaise chote padaarth ke liye ‘jivit samadhi’ shabd kaa prayog
 Vagadambar arises from the attempt of sublime encroachment
 jahaan lekhak madyap kii bhanti aacharan kar praayah anpekshit, nirarthak or asangat aaveg kii abhivyakti karata he arthath jahaan aaveg ke niyantran kii aavashyaktaa hone par bhi aaveg kii abhivyakti kii jaae
 The expression of impulse gives rise to mood and reduces subluxation
 logon ko prabhavit karne ke moh main atishyoktipurna kathan hi shabdaadambar he
 Bihari couplets in Hindi suffer from this defect
 udaahranarth, lonzinus kaa mat he ki stri ke liye chakshu-dansh athwa ‘chakshu-phoduk’ or ‘putali’ ke liye ‘aankh kii kumari’ aadi shabdon kaa prayog maatr shabdaadambar he, bhashaa kaa alankaar nahin he
 In later critics, Hegel compares it to beauty to illustrate the nature of the sublime
 uske matanusaar soundarya kaa arth he saamanjasy
 In beauty, there is a harmony between the object and art aspects
 udaatt kii sthiti sundar se bhinn he
 Sublime is one where his emotion is more expansive and quintessential than his form
 higel yah bhi maanate hai ki udaatt ke mul main vichaaron kii utkrushtataa he or vichaaron kii mahatta vyakti ke ucch charitra se janm paati he
 If the character of a person is great then his thoughts will also be great
 edmund bark ne lonzinus dwaara vivechit pratibha-prasut kalpana tathaa vichaar bhaavana aadi kii vishalata ke aadhaar par udaatt ke swaroop kii spashtikaran karte hue kaha he ki jis vastu yaa rachana main prabhavit karne kii shakti he or jo apane abhinav prabhaav se prekshak ko chakit kar sakati he, vahiin udattatavya samajhnaa chahie
 We can take the example of creation of the sublime element, the great form of Hanuman presented in the pyramid and the beautiful form of ramacharitra-manas, the great form of Krishna in the Mahabharata, etc
 bark ne udaatt-tatva padaarthon ke atirikt dhwani ke bheetar bhi sweekaar kiya he, jaise baari aandhi, vishaal prapaat, bijli kii garaj, topon kii garjana main bhi udaatt-tatva rahata he
 In fact, arrogance is closer than lofty than beauty
 kavi-karm ke rup main anand kii pratishtha lonzinus kii aisi dein he jo ek ore unhen horess jaise alankaar-shastri se or duusari ore arestu jaise kavy-shastri se bhinn karti he
 Aristotle's depiction is a kind of treatment envisaged especially in the context of tragedy, while Longine's 'anand' is a feat whose nutritious foundation extends to all of epic tragedy, progress
 vastutah udaatt kaa vivechan or vishleshan lonzinus ke ‘peri ipsus’ me sarvaadhik rup main hua he
 The lofty theory of Longinus is the result of western review
 unka ‘udaatt’ jivan ke arjeet paksh kii abhivyakti hai, madhur paksh ke liye usamen koi sthaan nahin he
 Therefore, his scripture is incomplete due to discussing half of life
 bhartiya kavyashastra kii purnataa usamen kahan, jisamen oj ke saath maadhurya gun bhi he
 On one side there is heroic and wonderful rasa and on the other hand there is adornment and humor
 vah sampoorn maanav kii kriti he
 The reason for this loneliness in Longinus's belief is that he composed his book as a form of speech, not poetry
 isiilie safal bhaashan ke liye mahatvapurn tattvon kaa hi nirvachan isamen miltaa he

 She became the head of the Drama Commission for the BBC in 2001
 us samay ke dauraan anial deronda or' da lost prince kaa unhone nirmaan kiya
 Stalinism is not the name of any ideology or any philosophical concept
 mote taur par samyavaadee samaaj ke nirmaan ke liye joseph stallin dwaara soviet sangh main apanaayi gayi nitiyon kaa samucchy hi stallinavaad kehalaata he
 It gradually developed into a political phenomenon in the three decades following the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the death of its leader Lenin
 chunki 1927 se lekar 1956 ke bich soviet communist party ke pramukh rahe joseph stallin ke jivan main hi kuch buddhijiviyon ne marxvad-leninavaad-stallinavaad naamak nayi vichaardhaara kaa sutrikaran karne kaa kamjor sa prayaas kiya tha
 An example of this is found in an article by Karl Radek published in Pravda, December 1934
 par is ravaiye ko na to stallin ne protsaahit kiya or na hi soviet communist party ke anya siddhantkaron ne
 Nevertheless, it got the name of Stalinism due to Stalin's intellectual and political personality present at the center of this phenomenon
 ise do tareeke se samajha ja saktaa he : soviet sangh main stallin ke netritv main tees saal tak chali samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii pariyojna ke taur par or is daur se nikali vaicharik or santhnik pravritiyon ke rup main jinhone sari duniya main marxvaadi raajnneeti ko kisi na kisi rup main prabhavit kiya
 Within the Marxist movement, there is a strong controversy about Stalin's role in Soviet history and evaluating Stalin's influence on marxism-leninism
 is lihaaz se sari duniya ke marxvaadi teen hisson main bante hue hai : ek hissaa vah he jo stallinavaad ko puri tarah se sweekaarte hue use marxvad kaa pramukh vyaavhaarik rup qaraar detaa he, doosraa hissaa use puri tarah se kaarij karte hue marxvaadi prayog kii tyajya vikruti qaraar detaa he or teesraa hissaa vah he jo stallinavaad ke prabhaav ko aam taur par prerak or sakaaratmak maanane ke baavjood uske kuch pahaluon kii aalochana karata he 
 In the non-marxist parts of the Left and other ideological circles, Stalinism is seen as a totalitarian trend that established a highly violent and oppressive state
 party kaaryakrttaaon ke bich stallin ke naam pukaare jane vaale joseph vissiarowich jugashvili kaa janm jiorgia main 21 disambar 1879 ko ek garib mochi ke ghar main hua tha
 He was educated in a religious seminary in Tbilisi, where he often faced punishment due to his revolutionary tendencies
 1899 main ve peshewar krantikari ho kar marxvaadi andolan main sakriy bhagidaari karne lage
 a skilled organizer and a mastery of underground political work, Stalin gained prominence in revolutionary circles
 1904 se hi unhone khud ko lenin or bolshevikon ke saath jod liya or 1912 main bolshevik kendriya samiti ke sadsy bane
 Between 1902 and 1917, Stalin was arrested countless times, given lengthy sentences and expelled several times
 1913 main unhen pakad kar siberia ke sudur uttari ilaake main bhej diya gaya jahaan se unki rihaai 1917 kii farvari kranti ke baad hi ho paayi
 Stalin held several key positions in the party immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution and during the Civil War
 paulitte beuro ke sabase shuruaati sadasyon main se ek stallin ko 1922 main party kaa mahasachiv niyukt kiya gaya
 He was the only leader of the party emerging from the lowest strata of the society to the highest positions
 janvari, 1924 main lenin kii mrityu ke baad unhone ek-ek karke apni nitiyon kaa virodh karne vaale trotski, zinoviv or buchaarin ko parajeet kiya or 1929 ke ant tak soviet party or rajya ke sarvocch netaa ke rup main ubhare
 Stalin died on March 5, 1953
 stallin ke aalochak aksar unhen keval jod-tod main maahir or maamuli bauddhik kshamtaaon vaale netaa ke rup main pesh karte hai
 But his work Anarchism or Socialism, which criticized Prince Kropatkin's ideas in 1906 itself? Was published
 unke saidhantik lekhan kii visheshta thi behad saral abhivyakti jiske kaaran vah kaaryakrttaaon ke bich kaafii pasand kiya jaataa tha
 Stalin is primarily known for the principle of establishing socialism in a country without a world revolution
 1924 ke baad se stallin ne apane is tark ko majboot karne vaala lekhan or vishleshan kiya
 It is often simplified to view Stalinism as a man of Stalin, but it is important to understand the structural reasons behind this political phenomenon
 bolshevik kranti ke parinamswaroop sthapit hui communist satta do virodhabhasi ayaamon se mil kar bani thi
 On the one hand, there were aspects of direct participation of the general public in the form of Soviets in which direct democracy was reflected
 loktantr kaa yah rup pashchimi deshon main viksit ho rahe bazaar aadhaarit udaarataavaadi loktantr se behatar or radical lagata tha
 On the other hand, a new emerging system was being guided and controlled by a disciplined worker based Communist Party
 is party kii bagdor lenin ke haath main thi jo sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee, loktantric cendravaad or krantikari haraval daste ke aadhaar par bani party kii bhoomika main yakeen rakhte the
 In his work Left Communism: a Childish Merge, published in 1920, he made it clear what the order of sequence of Soviet power would be
 sabase upar netaa, phir party, phir mazdoor varg or phir janata
 The responsibility of Stalinism, which flourished in the backdrop of the supremacy of the leader and the party, can be attributed to some ideological trends as well as to the extraordinary coincidence of the peoples of our country
 1918-21 ke bich chale grih yuddh, uske baad ke do varshon or phir 1924-27 ke bich kii avadhi ko itihaaskaaron ne ‘sarvasattavadi loktantr’ kaa virodhabhasi naam diya he
 It is believed that the seed of Stalinism fell on this stage
 baad ke saalon main pashchimi takaton dwaara pehle samaajawaadee rajya kii ‘poonjeewaadi or samrajyavaadee gherebandi’ kaa muqabla karne ke naam par kai tarah ke sansthagat or vaicharik taur-tareeke ijad kiye gayi
 Except for a few of these, Stalin was not responsible for himself
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad party ke sheersh netritv main shaamil unke tatkaaleen saathi or satta ke liye unase hode karne vaale netaa bhi un adhinayakawadi or damankaaree pravritiyon kii shuruyaat main bhagidaar the jinke aadhaar par aane vaale samay ke liye soviet rajya kii vyaavhaarik neenv rakhi ja rahi thi
 Russian scholar Mikhail Ilyin has divided the development of the phenomenon of Stalinism into several stages
 soviet party ke bheetar kai saal tak chale gahan satta- sangharsh kaa ant disambar, 1927 main hui party congress ke rup main hua
 He has labeled this period as nascent Stalinism
 bachakaana vampanth ke marz kii aalochana karte hue lenin ne trotski dwaara pravartit satat kranti kii thisis se asahmati vyakt kii thi
 Five years before this, Lenin had shown the opposite of the established Marxist view in one of his articles that due to uneven economic-political development, efforts would have to be made to establish socialism in some countries or in the same country
 1921 main hui dasvin congress se hi party main ‘parjing’ arthath virodh kii awaz uthaane waalon kaa nishkasana karke party kii safaai kaa chalan shuru ho gaya tha
 Stalin, who attained a central position as party general secretary in 1922, added the idea of establishing socialism in a country in the second edition of his work The Foundations of Leninism in 1924 only by understanding this analysis of Lenin
 stallin ke samakaleen soviet siddhantkaar nikolai buchaarin ne bhi is vichaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki agar duniya ke pehle samaajawaadee rajya ko faujee suraksha kii guarantee di ja sake to ek desh main samaajwaad kii rachana kii ja sakati he
 Stalin liberated the party from opponents of his policies until the Fifteenth Congress, using the purging repeatedly
 party ke prayek pad par niyukti unke haath main aa gayi or unhone kshetreey party cametiyon main vishesh vibhaag sthapit kiye taaki har tarah kii niyuktiyon kii kadi nigaraanee kii ja sake
 Thus by 1927, the way of establishing totalitarian rule as a party-state in the Soviet Union was completely cleared
 duusare daur ko udiyaman stallinavaad kaa naam diya gaya he jo 1930 tak chalaa
 This was the time of industrialization, the collectivization of agriculture and the beginning of the Five Year Plans
 arthvyavastha puri tarah se rajya ke niojit niyantran main chali gayi
 Any separate identity on the surface of society was considered anti-soviet
 samaroopikaran kaa bolbalaa ho gaya
 These moves led to opposition within the party, which led Stalin to campaign vigorously from 1929 to 30 in the party
 kareeb ek lakh communist nikaal diye gayi
 Some ten percent of the old members were removed and new industrial workers were made members of the party
 1930-34 kii avadhi ko shuruaati stallinavaad qaraar dete hue ilyin ne bataaya he ki is daur main stallin ne varg sangharsh ko or tikhaa karne kii ghoshnaa karte hue yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki samaajwaad ko poonjeewaadi sazishon se bachaane ke liye raajnneetik virodhiyon ke kilaaf chal rahaa damanchakra kis tarah zaruri he
 In 1933, the phase of purging once again took place and 18 percent of the party members were removed
 lekin is baar unki jagah naye sadasyon kii bhartee nahin kii gayi
 The period 1934–41 was of complete Stalinism
 is daur main stallin kii vyakti-puja ko badhaava diya gaya
 This period of Stalinism is also known for the prosecutions of some of the important leaders of the Bolshevik revolution
 in mukademon main buchaarin or kamenev jaise netaaon ko apane aparaadh sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor karke maut kii sazaa di gayi
 In the same period the phenomenon of Nomenkletura emerged
 yah ek latin shabd tha jiskaa matlab tha naamon kii suchi
 Nomenkletura included workers and leaders for various committees through a process of advance nominations
 is suchi main naam aane kaa matlab tha ki vah vyakti party- pranali dwaara niyantrit rahegaa, party jab chaahegi use hataa degi, padonnati karegi yaa use haashiye par phenk diya jayega
 Milovan Districts criticized Stalinism and called Nomenkletura a new class
 lekin soviet sangh main shashan chalaane waalon kaa yah tabaka mukhyatah party or prashasnic mashinari ke bich pul kaa kaam karata tha
 It was a major part of the government's system of control and mobilization
 isane rajya kii sanstha ko ek prashasnic bandobast main simit karke rakh diya
 After 1936, a 'struggle against the traitors of the public' started in place of party-purging
 yah ‘sangharsh’ nikolai yezove ke netritv main karyrat aantarik maamalon ke mantralay kii dekharekh main chalane vaali sikret police ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 By 1938, Yezhov, under the direct orders of Stalin, fiercely oppressed the state
 dwitiya vishwa-yuddh main soviet party-rajya pranali kii faujee jeet ne stallin kii vyakti-puja ko jabardast oochaal diya
 As a result of the world war, the Soviet Union got the status of the second superpower of the world along with America
 1945-52 ke bich kaa daur viksit stallinavaad mana jaataa he jisamen stallin ke netritv main duniya ke paimaane par ek samaajawaadee khemaa ubhara
 In this era, Marxism was declared a science and all types of sciences were included in it
 prakritik vigyaanon se nikali daleelon ke zariye dwandvatmak bhautikwaad or aitihaasik bhautikwaad ko pusht kiya jane laga
 Stalin himself led campaigns about many types of science
 isi dauraan bhashaa-vigyaan par khud unki pustika prakashit hui
 Communist International ie Comintern played a significant role in making Stalinism the dominant trend of world communist movement outside the Soviet Union
 isaki sthapana bolshevik kranti kii prishthbhumi or madhya europe main chal rahi krantikari ubhaar kii paristhitiyon main lenin dwaara 1919 main kii gayi thi
 In order to become a member of it, every Communist Party had to declare itself free from reformists and middlemen
 duusare, keval ve hi partiyaan isaki sadsy ban sakati thim jo kathor anushaasan or sanghathan ke atyant kendrikrut niyamon kaa paalan karte hue khuli raajnneeti ke saath-saath bhumigat raajnneeti kaa bhi talmail baithaati hon or jo apane desh kii senaaon main bhi communist prachaar chalaati hon
 The way Stalin was creating socialist economy and social relations in the Soviet Union, Comintern tried to run its member communist parties on exactly the same pattern
 1952 main teraa saal ke antaraal ke baad unnisvin party congress hui jisamen stallin ne party-rajya pranali main kai tarah ke sudhaaron kii bhoomika baandhi
 Stalin had reported to Jyarji Malenkov by not presenting himself a report on the activities of the party in this Congress
 kuch logon kaa khyaal tha ki yah parjing ke naye daur kii taiyaari he
 In fact, it was a preparation for the latter Stalinism that was to begin the new preparations to be made in the light of the post-world War role of the Soviet Union
 lekin march, 1953 main stallin kii mrityu ke baad party ke bheetar satta-sangharsh shuru ho gaya jisamen nikita khrushchev stallin ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ubhare
 Khrushchev saw that the economy has been modernized under Stalinism, but agriculture is in a bad state and consumers do not even have the basics
 unhone soviet vyavastha ko stallinavaad ke prabhaav se mukt karne kaa abhiyaan chalaaya taaki use aarthik rup se adhik kaamyaab banaaya ja sake
 He described the purging done by Stalin as anti-marxism-leninism
 haalaanki kai prekshkon kii us samay bhi manyata thi ki soviet pranali ne jo rup le liya he, usamen kisi tarah kaa sudhaar karnaa takreeban naammumkin he
