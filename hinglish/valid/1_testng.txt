 China's Uzbek communities still write Uzbek in arabic-persian script
 soviet sangh kaa ant hone ke baad uzbekistan main kuch log san 1992 ke uparant latin varnmaala kaa bhi prayog karne lage
 a lot of words are common in Hindi and Uzbek, but the Persian accent seems clearer in Uzbek than in Hindi

 It is identified by a horizontal line known as 'shirirekha'
 sanskrit, pali, hindi, marathi, konkani, sindhi, kashmiri, dogri, khas, nepal bhashaa, tamaque bhashaa, gadhwali, bodo, angika, magahi, bhojpuri, maithili, santhali aadi bhashaayen devanagari main likhi jaati hai
 Additionally, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bishnupuria Manipuri, Romani and Urdu languages are also written in Devanagari in some cases
 devanagari vishwa main sarvaadhik prayukt lipiyon main se ek he
 Like most languages, Devanagari is written from left to right
 prayek shabd ke upar ek rekha khinchi hoti he ise shirorekha kehete hai
 Devanagari has evolved from the Brahmi script
 yah ek dhvanyatmak lipi he jo prachlit lipiyon main sabase adhik vaigyanik he
 From this the scientific and comprehensive script is probably only Adhva script
 bharat kii kai lipiyaan devanagari se bahut adhik milti-julati hai, jaise- bangla, gujarati, gurumukhi aadi
 With the help of computer programs, interchange of Indian scripts has become very easy
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke kisi bhi shabd yaa dhwani ko devanagari lipi main jyon kaa tyon likhaa ja saktaa he or phir likhe paath ko lagbhag 'hu-ba-hu' uccharan kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki roman lipi or anya kai lipiyon main sambhav nahin he, jab tak ki unka vishesh maanakeekaran na kiya jaye, jaise itrans yaa ieesti
 It has a total of 52 letters, with 14 vowels and 38 consonants
 aksharon kii kram vyavastha bhi bahut hi vaigyanik he
 Classification of vowel-consonant, soft-hard, hypnotic-hypnotic, resonant-antasthe-heat, etc
 are also scientific
 ek mat ke anusaar devnagar me prachlan ke kaaran iskaa naam devanagari padaa
 The indications of many scripts in India and Asia are different from Devanagari, but the pronunciation and alphabet are the same as Devanagari, because they all originated from the Brahmi script
 isliye in lipiyon ko paraspar aasaani se lipyantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Devanagari is simple in terms of writing, beautiful in terms of beauty and legible in reading
 bhartiya ankon ko unki vaigyaniktaa ke kaaran vishwa ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya he
 The use of the name Devanagari or Nagari began with "why" and what was its etymological tendency - it is not yet completely certain
 'nagar' apbhransh yaa gujarati "nagar" brahmanon se uskaa sambandh bataaya gaya he
 But in the absence of strong evidence, this opinion is doubtful
 dakshin main iskaa pracheen naam "nandinagari" tha
 May be "nandinagar" is a locative and this script has something to do with it
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki "nagar" jan isamen likhaa karte the, at: "nagari" abhidhaan padaa or jab sanskrit ke granth bhi isamen likhe jane lage tab "devanagari" bhi kaha gaya
 Symbols or triangles, chakras, etc
 used in the worship of gods were called "devanagar"
 kalantar main naam ke prathamaksharon kaa unase bodh hone laga or jis lipi main unako sthaan mila- vah 'devanagari' yaa 'nagari' kahi gai
 At the core of all these aspects is the predominance of imagination, conclusive evidence is unavailable
 bharat devanagari lipi kii kshamta se shatabdiyon se parichit rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Dwarka Prasad Saxena, the first use of Devanagari script is found in the inscription of Naib Jayabhatta of Gujarat
 aathvin shatabdi main chitrakoot, naveen main baroda ke dhruvaraj bhi apane rajyadeshon main is lipi kaa upyog kiya karte the
 The Samagadha Tamrapat of Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga of 758 AD is found on which Devanagari is inscribed
 shilaharvansh ke ganndraditya ke utkeern lekh kii lipi devanagari he
 Its time is eleventh century, Cholaraja Rajendra coins of this time have been found on which the Devanagari script is inscribed
 rashtrakut raja indraraj ke lekh main bhi devanagari kaa vyavhaar kiya he
 The donation letter of Pratihara king Mahendrapal is also in Devanagari script

 shamshuddin iltutamish ke sikkon par bhi devanagari ankit he
 Sanuddin Ferozeshah I, Jalaluddin Razia, Bahram Shah, Alaluddin Marudshah, Naseeruddin Mahmood, Muizuddin, gayasuddin Balvan, Muizuddin Kaikubad, Jalaluddin Hero Sani, Alauddin Mahmad Shah etc
 have inscribed Devanagari letters on their coins
 akbar ke sikkon par devanagari main ‘ram‘ siya kaa naam ankit he
 Gaiyasuddin Tughlaq, Sher Shah Suri, Islam Shah, Muhammad Adilshah, Ghiyasuddin Ibj, Ghiyasuddin Sani etc
 followed the same tradition
 brahmi or devanagari lipi : bhashaa ko lipiyon main likhane kaa prachlan bharat main hi shuru hua
 Sumerian, Babylonian and Greek people learned it from India
 prachinkaal main brahmi or devanagari lipi kaa prachlan tha
 Other scripts around the world originated from Brahmi and Devanagari scripts
 brahmi lipi ek pracheen lipi he jisase kai asian lipiyon kaa vikaas hua he
 Brahmi, like Kharoshthi, was spread throughout Asia
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki brahmi lipi 10,000 saal puraani he lekin yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah lipi usase bhi zyada puraani he
 Emperor Ashoka also adopted this script: The great emperor Ashoka named the Brahmi script as Dhammalipi
 brahmi lipi ko devanagari lipi se bhi pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is said to be a script derived from the ancient indus-saraswati script
 hadappa samskruti ke log sindhu lipi ke alaav is lipi kaa bhi istemaal karte the, tab sanskrit bhashaa ko bhi isi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 In linguistic terms, Devanagari script is considered as alphabetic script
 lipi ke vikassopanon kii drushti se "chitratmak", "bhavatmak" or "bhavchitratmak" lipiyon ke ananthar "aksharatmak" str kii lipiyon kaa vikaas mana jaataa he
 The alphabetic state developed after the alphabetic state of the script due to the opinion of Westerners and many Indian linguists
 sabase viksit avasthaa maani gai he dhvanyatmak lipi kii
 "devanagari" is said to be alphabetical because its characters are letters - vowels and consonants
 "k", "kha" aadi vyanjan saswar hai- akaryukt hai
 They are not only sounds but are aloud
 at: greek, roman aadi varnmalas hai
 But here it is to be kept in mind that the "panini" of the consonants in the sounds of the "brahmi" or "bharati" alphabet of India has been explained by "patanjali" in the 14 formulas of Varnasammanaya
 Is that the use of the vowel "akaar" conjugated in consonants is for the purpose of pronunciation only
 vah tatvat: varna kaa ang nahin he
 Thinking from this point of view it can be said that the alphabet of this script is essentially phonetic, not alphabetic
 devanagari kii varnmaala main 12 swar or 34 vyanjan hai
 a letter is formed by a combination of zero or one or more consonants and a vowel
 nimnlikhit swar aadhunik hindi ke liye diye gayi hai
 Their pronunciation is slightly different in Sanskrit
 sanskrit main i do swaron kaa yugma hota he or "a-i" yaa "aa-i" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Similarly, au is spoken like "a-u" or "a-u"
 iske alaava hindi or sanskrit main ye varnakshar bhi swar maane jate hai : When no vowel is used, 'A' is considered there
 swar ke na hone ko halant athwa viraam se darshaya jaataa he
 Such as KGGH
 hindi bhashaa main mukhyat: arabi or farsi bhashaaon se aaye shabdon ko devanagari main likhane ke liye kuch varnon ke neeche nukta lage varnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 But in Hindi also most people do not use nuktas
 iske alaava sanskrit, marathi, nepali evam anya bhashaaon ko devanagari main likhane main bhi nukton kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Th is mainly used in the hill languages, as in Dogri the word for "tear" is "athru"
 hindi main d or dh vyanjan farsi yaa arabi se nahin liye gayi hai, na hi ye sanskrit main paye jaye hai
 In fact, they are the changed forms of ordinary s and d in Sanskrit
 devanagari ank nimna rup main likhe jate hai : In the Devanagari script, two consonants are spelled as follows: brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main devanagari lipi sabase adhik sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detii he
 Devanagari also supports conjuncts of more than 2 dishes
 chhandas font devanagari main bahut sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detaa he
 Some of the Devanagari characters used in earlier times are different from modern Devanagari
 1

 2

 3

 In the unity of Hindustan, Devanagari script can be more useful than Hindi itself

 Seth Govindas was in favor of declaring it a national script
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki bharat main anekon bhashaayen hona koi samasya nahin he jabaki unki lipiyaan alag-alag hona bahut badi samasya he
 Gandhiji printed a Gujarati language book in Devanagari script in 1940 and stated that its dream is that every language emanating from Sanskrit should be scripted in Devanagari
 isi prakaar vinoba bhaave kaa vichaar tha ki- The area affected by Buddhist culture is not new to Nagari

 devvani kii vahika hone ke naate devanagari bharat kii simaaon se baahar nikalakar china or japan ke liye bhi samuchit vikalp de sakati he
 People of Indian origin are familiar with Devanagari wherever they live in the world, especially people from Mauritius, Suriname, Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad, Tubago, etc
 is tarah devanagari lipi na keval bharat ke andar saare praantvaasiyon ko prem-bandhan main baandhakar simolanghan kar dakshin-purv asia ke puraane vrihattar bhartiya parivaar ko bhi ‘bahujan hitay, bahujan sukhaay‘ anupranit kar sakati he tathaa vibhinn deshon ko ek adhik sucharu or vaigyanik vikalp pradaan kar ‘vishwa nagari‘ kii padavi kaa daawa ikkisvin sadi main kar sakati he
 The spread on it will not be the medium of scriptural imperialism and exploitation but the conductor of lofty human values like truth, non-violence, renunciation, self-control, from unrest to sata, light from tamas and immortality from death
 duniya kii kai bhashaaon ke liye devanagari sabase acha vikalp ho sakati he kyonki yah yah bolne kii puri aazaadee detaa he
 This cannot happen in any other script of the world
 indonesia, vietnam, africa aadi ke liye to yahi sabase sahi rahegaa
 Looking at Ashtadhyayi, one can understand that there is no better script in the world
 agar duniya pakshpatarahit ho to devanagari hi duniya kii sarvamaanya lipi hogi kyonki yah purnat: vaigyanik he
 For effective solution of the spelling problem in English language, Deoghari script based on Devanagari has been proposed
 vistrut lekh devanagari kii vaigyaniktaa dekhen
 Just as the world accepted the Indian numerals due to their scientificness, Devanagari will one day become a world class due to its scientificness
 devanagari kaa vikaas us yug main hua tha jab lekhan haath se kiya jaataa tha or lekhan ke liye shilaayein, taadptr, charmpatr, bhojaptr, tamrapatr aadi kaa hi prayog hota tha
 But writing technology has developed a lot and through the printing press, typewriter etc
 it has reached the computer age where it has become possible to write even by speaking
 praudyogiki ke vikaas ke saath kisi bhi lipi ke lekhan main samasyaayen aana pratyaashit he
 For this reason, efforts were also made to improve or standardize from time to time in Devanagari

 The role of many institutional efforts has also been very important in the development of Devanagari
 1935 main hindi sahitya sammelan ne nagari lipi sudhaar samiti ke madhyam se barhakhadi or shirorekha se sambandhit sudhaar kiye
 Similarly, in 1947, a committee constituted under the chairmanship of Narendra Dev gave important suggestions related to twelvekhadi, quantity arrangement, anusvara and resonant

 The cultural anthropologist studies the ways in which humans encounter their natural and social status, learns ritual customs and provides them from one ancestral to the next
 bhinn-bhinn samskritiyon main ek hi saadhy ke kai saadhan hai
 The principles of organization of family relations, fishing nets and creation of world are different in every society
 phir bhi prayek samaaj main jivan kaary-kalap suniyojit he
 Stable forms of tradition also change due to internal development or external contact
 vyakti ek vishesh samaaj main janm lekar un rasm-rivaajon ko grahan karata he, vyavhaar karata he or prabhavit karata he jo uski saanskrithik viraasat hai
 All such subjects come under cultural anthropology
 saanskrithik maanav shaastra kaa kshetra bahut vistrut he
 Other subjects study a part of human activity
 saamanyat: maanavshastri aisi jatiyon kaa adhyayan karte hai jo paashchaatya saanskrithik dhara se pare hai
 They try to study the group of rituals of each caste as a collective
 yadi ve samskruti ke ek hi paksh par apane adhyayan ko kendrit rakhte hai to unka khaas uddeshy us paksh main or samskruti ke dusron pakshon main sambandhon kaa vishleshan hota he
 To consider the entire culture, they study the technical knowledge, economic life, social and political institutions, religion, language, folklore and art of the people of that society
 ve in pakshon kaa alag-alag vivechan karte hai par saath-saath yah bhi dekhte hai ki ve vibhinn paksh samay rup main kis prakaar kaam karte hai jisase us samaaj ke sadsy apane parisar se samavasthit hote hai
 In this way cultural anthropologists are different from economists, political-sciences, sociologists, comparative scholars of religions, penetrating arts or literature
 samskruti shabd kaa prayog anek arthon main hota he
 In anthropology it is used in a specific sense
 yah uskaa aadharbhoot siddhant he
 The qualities of culture are as follows: maanav samskruti ke saath janm nahin letaa lekin usamen samskruti grahan karne kii kshamta hoti he
 He learns that

 Culture originates from the zoological, complex psychological and historical organs of human life
 uske nirupan or vikaas main in tatwon kaa bahumoolya yoga hota he
 There are specific parts of the structure of culture
 sabase chote bhaag ko saanskrithik tatv kehete hai
 An element is a group consisting of several elements
 ek samskruti main anek saanskrithik tatv samooh hote hai
 Additionally many cultures have one or more motivational principles that give them uniqueness
 samskruti anek vibhaagon main vibhakt hoti he, jaise bhautik samskruti, saamaajik sansthaayen dharm or vishwaas, kala evam lokvarta, bhashaa ityadi
 Culture is variable
 samskruti ke prayek ang main parivartan hota rahata he, kisi main tivrata se, kisi main mand gati se
 External influences are also not perceived randomly
 kisi main virodh kam hota he, kisi main adhik
 There are variations in culture that sometimes appear in the behavior of individuals of the same society
 jitani choti ikai hogi utana hi kam antar uske sadasyon ke aachaar-vichaar main hoga
 There is a normality in the nature, processes and formation of a culture that makes its scientific analysis possible
 samskruti ke madhyam se maanav apane sampurna parisar se samavasthit hota he or use rachanaatmak abhivyakti kaa saadhan miltaa he
 Cultural anthropology does not merely study the cultures of the present period

 Prehistoric archaeologists dig from beneath the earth and investigate ancient cultures

 Therefore prehistory is an integral part of cultural anthropology
 bhashaa ke hi madhyam se samskruti kaa nirmaan hua he
 From the beginning of creation, man has tried to express his desires and needs in many ways
 pehle to haav-bhav tathaa sanket chinhon se kaam chalaa
 Later he took the form of language
 prayek bhashaa main uske bolne waalon kii sari manyataayen, spasht tathaa aspasht vichaar, bauddhik or bhaavnaatmak kriyaayein nirhit rahati hai
 All cultural elements of primitive society remain safe in its language repository
 kahavatein, paheliyaan, lokkathaayen, loakgeet, prarthana mantra, ityadi main samaaj kaa sanskaar pradarshit hota he
 Knowledge of language is necessary to get acquainted with the introverted stories of the society
 sambandh suchak shabdaawalee se samaaj main paariwarik or duusare sambandhon kaa pataa chalata he
 The change that occurs due to external influences on culture is also reflected in language
 nae vichaar or nai vastuen jab vyavhaar main aane lagati hai to unke saath nae shabd bhi aate hai
 In this way both culture and language develop equally
 aadi samskritiyon main bhashaaon kii vividhta tathaa unke swaroop kii jatilta main anusandhan kii aseem saamagree he
 Just as we can solve cultural mysteries by analyzing the nature of language, in the same way, knowledge of structural elements and processes of cultures can give us a wider light on some problems of philology
 saanskrithik maanav shaastra ke antargat saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik jivan, dharm, bhashaa, kala ityadi kaa adhyayan aata he
 Tylar studied with reference to culture, but his contemporary Morgan did his work in the context of society
 durkaeem ne samaaj shastreey parampara ko pusht kiya
 Thus, both traditions continue to follow parallel streams in dance
 america maanav shastri samskritiparak vichaardhaara se aavirbhoot hai
 English scholar Durkheim is the originator of this tradition
 amareeki vidwaanon ke vichaar main samskruti kaa sambodh samaaj ke sambodh se kahin adhik vyapak he

 Studies of pathophysiological regulators of mediastinitis in young people showed that all the aorta and more than half of the right coronary arteries of young people aged 7–9 years began to manifest malformation
 Yet most adolescents are more concerned about other risks such as HIV, accidents and cancer than cardiovascular disease

 Causes, prevention and or treatment of all types of cardiovascular diseases have been active areas of biomedical research and hundreds of scientific studies are being published every week
 a trend has emerged, particularly in the 2000s, in which numerous studies have shown a relationship between fast food and increased heart disease
 These studies include studies by Ryan mckee Memorial Research Institute, Harvard University and the Sydney Center for Cardiovascular Health
 Several major fast food chains, particularly Macdonald's, have opposed these methods and have reacted by offering more hygienic menu options

 The express purpose of the League was to create a political entity that would have been an independent state separate from Britain - possibly similar to the Canadian Federation, Australian Union, or Central African Union; However, before this happened, the union collapsed due to internal political conflict

 To prepare for the first federal election, two federation-wide parties were organized as a confederation of local political parties
 donon kaa aayojan jamaica netaaon dwaara kiya gaya: norman manale dwaara west indies ke sangheey shram party or alexander bastamante dwaara democratic lebar party
 In a broader context, the WIFLP was composed of urban-based parties throughout the federation, while the DLP consisted of rural-based parties
 ek choti si tritiy party, fedral democratic party kii sthapana navambar 1957 main trinidad ke ek samooh dwaara kii gai thi, haalaanki yah party ek bhi seat hasil karne main naakaam rahi thi
 The platforms were similar in many ways to the two major national parties
 donon ne united kingdom, sanyukt rajya america or canada ke saath sambandhon ko banaae rakhane or majbooti banane kii vakaalat kii: paryaton ko protsaahit or vistaarit karne par jor diya; rin praapt karne ke liye, vittiya sahaayta or takneekee sahaayta, ke liye sangh main british guyana or british haunduras ko laane kaa prayaas karne par jor diya
 Despite these similarities, there were considerable differences
 WIFLP ne krishi ke protsaahan kii vakaalat kii thi, jabaki DLP ne nijee udyog or shram, maanav or aarthik sansadhano ke vikaas donon ke liye anukool jalwaayu kaa vaada kiya

 The DLP did not say anything about complete internal self-government, attacked socialism, tried to avoid high taxation and wished the unity of the West Indies, emphasized freedom of expression and expression and encouragement of trade unions
 25 march 1958 ko sangheey chunaav kaa aayojan kiya gaya

 The likely leader of the WIFLP was Norman Manley, Prime Minister of Jamaica, and then arguably the premier of Trinidad & Tobago, Dr
 Eric Williams
 lekin donon hi ne sangheey chunaav nahin ladaa or apane sambandhit dweep ke niyantran ko banaae rakhane ko pasand kiya
 This meant that the leaders of the two most important provinces did not see the Union as viable
 isi tarah, dlapi ke jamcon sansthaapak alexander bastamante ne bhi sangh ke chunaav ke liye manaa kar diya or trinidadian eshford sinanan ke liye party netritv chhod diya
 The absence of prominent Jamaican leaders in any role at the federal level undermined the federation's unity
 rajya parishad ke anya sadasyon main shaamil the: There were several units under general services for the entire federation: sangh kii salaahkaar sevaaon main shaamil the: The politics of this nascent union was demolished by conflicts between the federal government and provincial governments, and between the two largest provinces and the smaller provinces

 For example, its provinces were not included in a single custom union

 Moreover, the post of Prime Minister was quite weak

 The Union in particular maintained close ties with Canada, whose past was also similar in that it was a federation of several former British colonies
 praarambhik varshon main, kai caribbean netaaon ne suzav diya ki west indies sangh ko ek canadian praant banane kii sambhaavna kii jaanch kerani chahie, haalaanki yah ek kshanbhangur se adhik kabhi nahin tha
 Despite the negotiations being fragmented, in May 1961, Canada presented two of the region's most important gifts to the West Indies Union: the two merchant ships, named The Federal Palm and the Federal Maple
 ye do jahaaj mahasang main maheene main do baar har dweep kaa daura karte the or dwipon ke bich ek mahatvapurn samudri sampark ko pradaan karte the
 Several reasons for the termination of the union have been enumerated, some of them in detail in the "problems" section above

 However, the immediate catalyst for the dissolution of the League was Jamaican dissent
 1961 tak, rajya ke maamalon ko lekar jamaica main asantosh ke kai kaaran paidaa ho gaye the: The most important reason for Jamaica being dissatisfied was the continuation of the Union's colonial status
 jamaica, sangh main isiilie shaamil hua tha kyonki uske netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki west indies ko jaldi hi swatantraaa de di jaaegi
 About three years after the formation of the Union, this did not happen, meanwhile, smaller British colonies such as Cyprus and Sierra Leone had gained independence
 is prakaar, kai jamaikans kaa maananaa tha ki dweep ko apane adhikaar se swatantraaa kii talash kerani chahie or aisa ho saktaa he
 At the same time there were problems with the capital proposed by the Union, Chaugaramasa, at that time it was in the hands of the United States
 carabian praant ke kai netaa mahasang kii rajdhani ke rup main chaugaaramas ko chaahate the
 Regional leaders such as Jamaica's Norman Manley and Dr
 Eric Williams advocated the release of Chaugaramas from the United States to the Union
 haalaanki america or britain asahmat the or mahasang ke pradhanmantri grantle adams ne chaugaaramas ko praapt karne se prantiy netaaon ko inkaar kar diya tha
 Many Jamaicans felt that the Sangh was disrupting their development process and the independence movement

 It was passed with 54 percent of the vote, despite opposition from the then provincial Prime Minister Manale
 swayan manale ko april 1962 ke dweep chunaavon main shikast mili or bastamate, 6 agast 1962 main swatantra jamaica ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 After leaving Jamaica, an attempt was made to build a new federation from the old rubble
 iske liye trinidad or tobago ke pradhanmantri williams par kaaphi nirbharta thi jinhone purv main kaha tha ki ve ek "majboot sangh" chaahate hai
 Antigua's Prime Minister Ware Bird replied that his province in the Union is an equal share of Trinidad, not like "a little Tobago"
 unhone sanket kiya ki ek majboot mahasang sweekaarya tha basharte ek ekaatmak rajya banane kaa koi bhi prayaas nahin kiya gaya ho
 Negotiations on this new union began in September 1961; However, he indicated that Trinidad would have to provide 75 to 80 percent of the new federation's revenue
 iske alaava, bhale hi trinidad ab nae sangh kii jansankhya kaa 60 pratishat kaa pratinidhitiv karata, vichaaradhin prastaav ke tahat use sansad main aadhi siton se bhi kam diya janaa tha
 By November, Williams indicated that he was now in favor of the idea of creating a unitary state
 usamen asafal hone par unhone trinidad or tobago ko swatantraaa lene kaa sankalp liya
 Under which, on 4 December 1961, he was confined by re-election as a Trinidadian leader
 baad main usee disambar main barbados ke pradhanmantri errole bairo, williams ke saath mili the, lekin sangh main trinidad ko rakhane ke liye use manaane main vifal ho gaye
 On January 14, 1962, the National People's Movement passed a resolution rejecting any further involvement with the Union
 khud williams ne kaha ki "das main se ek kii sankhya nikaal den to keval shunya hi rah jaataa he" duusare shabdon main, jamaica ke bina, sangh sambhav nahin tha
 Trinidad and Tobago gained independence on 31 August 1962
 trinidad or jamaica ke bina, shesh "nanhe aath" ne west indies sangh ke kuch swaroop ko banaae rakhane kaa prayaas kiya, jo is baar barbados par kendrit tha
 However, these talks ultimately proved fruitless
 apane do sabase bade rajyon ke bina, sangh vittiya divaaliepan se barbaad ho gaya tha
 Barbados at this time refused to bear the financial burden on its shoulder and Antigua and Grenada began to become interested with the idea of merging with Jamaica and Trinidad respectively
 united kingdom kii sansad ke west indies adhinium 1962 ke saath westeindies sangh kanoonee taur par bhang hua
 The remaining "lower eight" provinces once again became separate territories which were directly governed from London, most of which were later independent, as follows: montserat, united kingdom kaa ek videshi kshetra bana hua he
 The Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands were separated from Jamaica after independence in 1962; Anguilla was separated from Saint Kitts and Nevis in 1980

 During the association's existence, each member continued to carry his or her own postage stamp as before; But on 22 April 1958, a set of three commemorative stamps were issued for each member
 in sabhi tikaton main ek aam dizine thi jisamen caribbean kaa nakshaa or rani elizabeth kaa chithran tha or uske sheersh par "da west indies / federation 1958 " likhaa hota tha or neeche sadsy kaa naam likhaa hota tha
 All these tickets were almost common in both mint and used condition
 west indies sangh, ek british caribbean sangh kaa pehla prayaas nahin tha 
 The history of previous attempts at federations and unions partially explains the failure of the 1958 Union

 paris main 7 may, 1713 ko janm
 The father was a mathematics teacher
 pita ke shikshan main ganit kii shiksha main uski pratibha aisi viksit hui ki baarah varsh kii avasthaa main hi apane french academy ke sammukh chaar vakr rekhaon ke gun par kiye apane avishkaar ke sambandh main ek niabandh padhaa
 In 1729, he wrote a book extending decourt's analytical geometry to three dimensions, published in 1731
 uske prakashit hote hi 18 varsh aayu main hi aayu sambandhi niyamon kii avhelnaa kar france kii academy ov science ne use apana sadsy manonith kiya
 In 1736, he was made a fellow by the Royal Society, a length of a fraction of the middle line with the mantis
 1743 i
 main usne apni suprasiddh ‘clero theorim’ pustak prakashit kii jisamen bhinn akshanshon ke sthanon par gurutvkarshan ke niyantaak ke jaanane kaa sutara sthapit kiya he
 In 1750 he was awarded the Chakra Academy of St
 Ketu on the rendering of his lunar theory
 1759 main usne heli ketu ke chakkar puraa karne ke samay kii gananaa kar khyaati praapt kii
 Apart from this, he continued to get important research related to mathematics
 17 may 1765 ko paris main uski mrityu hui
 The term altruism is used for sound waves whose frequency is so high that it is not heard by human ears
 saadharantaya maanav shravanshakti kaa paraas 20 se lekar 20,000 kampan prati second tak hota he
 Therefore, a sound with a frequency of more than 20,000 is called para्रव्यravya
 kyonki mote taur par dhwani kaa veg gas main 330 meter prati sein
, drav main 1,200 me
 prati sein
 tathaa thos main 4,000 me
 prati se
 hota he, atev parashravya dhwani kaa tarangadairghy saadharantaya 10 - 4 senmi
 hota he
 Its precision is comparable to the wavelength of light
 apni sookshmata ke hi kaaran ye tarangen udyog-dhandhon tathaa anveshan kaaryon main ati upyukt siddh hui hai or aajkal inkaa mahatv atyadhik bad gaya he
 The figure below shows the range of waste, audio and ultrasonic waves and their frequency: isaki nimnlikhit vidhiyaan hai : In 1899, Conning produced ultrasonic waves of up to 90,000 vibrations per cent through small oscillators
 ideman ne galton siti ko banaaya, jiske dwaara vah ek nishchit ayamavaale 1,00,000 kampan prati se
 utpann karne main safal hua
 The wind blows through a pool
 hawa kii yah dhara ekadirgh chhidr main se bahakar ek kshurdhar se takaraakar parashravya kampan paidaa karti he
 Hartmann produced a high energy parasite by the gas-current generator
 hopman ne kaach kii chad ko uski lambaai kii samaantar disha main compit kar 33,000 kampanvaali adhik urja kii parashravya dhwani utpann kii
 Now they have only historical significance
 atberg ne sphuling-antaraal dwaara 3,00,000 aavritiwali parashravya dhwani paidaa kii, kintu yah dhwani kai bhinn bhinn aavritiyon kaa mishran hoti he or inkaa aayam bhi anishchit hota he
 If a rod or tube of a magnetized material is placed in a magnetic field parallel to its length, then its length changes due to molecular rearrangement
 is ghatana ko chumbakeey aakarantar kehete hai
 This research was done by Joule
 lambaai kaa yah parivartan chumbakeey balakshetra kii disha par nirbhar nahin he
 If a ferromagnetic material is placed on an alternating magnetic field, it will vibrate with its natural or overload frequency and produce a parasitic sound
 chumbakeey shithily ke kaaran vidyucchumbakeey urja kaa parashravya urja main parivartan adhik acha nahin hota he
 Also, in this method the ultrasonic sound of maximum frequency cannot be produced because the substance cannot take the shape of a ring
 vincent or peers, donon main chumbakeey acarantar dwaara parashravya kampan paidaa karne ke liye vidyutiya paripath banaae
 This circuit generates automatic excited electrical oscillation, due to the inverse effect of magnetic shaping, as the elongated decrease of the rod length changes the magnetization and the induced electromagnetic force controls the current of the cube through the grid
 is vidhi kaa mukhya laabh isaki saadagi evam sastepan main he tathaa isamen truti he taap par nirbhar rahanaa or aavriti kaa adhik na rahanaa
 Maximum frequency up to 200 khz can be generated by this method

 curi ne bataaya ki yadi samamiti rahit sphatikon yaa crystalon ke kinhin vishesh akshon par dabaav lagaaya jaae to unke do talon par vijaateey vidyudavesh utpann hote hai
 a few days later the same effect was also invented by these two brothers, namely, that it is proved that applying force changes the length of these crystals
 is ghatana ko daab-vidyut-prabhaav kehete hai
 In 1917 AD Langevin stimulated the quartz crystal with an oscillating electric circuit to vibrate at its natural frequency
 yadi vidyut paripath kii aavriti crystal kii aavriti ke baraabar ho, jo crystal anunadit kampan karne lagata he
 The crystal produces a superfluous sound of its natural frequency with amplified frequency and fixed amplitude
 parashravya dhwani utpann karne kii yahi arvachin vidhi he
 In addition to quartz, tourmaline, tartaric acid, rochel salts, barium titanate, etc
 are also used to make oscillators
 upyukt aakaar ke crystalon se yaa to unki swaabhaavik aavriti, athwa vishay sannadi, utpann karke 2v 104 se lekar 2v 108 tak kii aavritiwali parashravya dhwani utpann kii jaati he
 Hartley's electric circuit crystal is vibrated
 paripath ke sandharitra ke maan ko samjit kar samaswarit kiya jaataa he
 In addition to this circuit, other circuits are used to generate ultrasonic sound for various purposes
 crystalon ko kaam main laane se purv vishesh reeti se kaata jaataa he or unako prayog ke liye vishesh reeti se rakhaa jaataa he
 There are mainly four types of introductory sounds of altruistic sound: jab gas madhyam main bilkul halake thos, athwa drav, ke kan chode jate hai tab ve parashravya dhwani ke dwaara apane avasthititv ke anusaar chaalit hote hai
 The study of their motion gives an introduction to the altruistic sound
 anthan lolak athwa vikiranmaapi se bhi parashravya tarangon kaa gyaan hota he
 These waves fall on the mandala of a particular instrument, pressing on it and rotating it
 mandalak kaa ghoomana uske alambansutra main lage darpan ke dwaara napa jaataa he
 If the superficial waves are not very fine, then they are observed by lycopodium powder by making the leading waves in the tube of the kunt

 An all-rounder is a cricketer who performs regularly in both batting and bowling
 haalanki sabhi gendbaajon ke liye ballebaaji jaruri hoti he or kuch ballebaaj kabhi-kabhaar gendbaaji bhi karte hai, zyaadaatar khilaadi in do chizon main se sirf kisi ek main hi nipun hote hai or ve visheshgy maane jate hai
 Some wicket-keepers have mastery of specialist batsmen and are also known as all-rounders, but the wicket-keeper batsman terminology is more commonly used for them
 mahanatam harfanmaulaa main jorge hurst, wilfred rods, mushtak mohammad, kith miller, garfield sobers, andrew flintoff, walter hamend, ian botham, jacks kallis, kapil dev, richard hadlee, dablyoo
 ji
 gres, kris kairns, shen watson, dwen braavo, imran khan or shahid aafridi kaa naam liya ja saktaa he
 However, there is no exact qualification for a player on the basis of which he is considered an all-rounder and the use of this name becomes subjective
 aamtaur par 'vaastavik harfanmaulaa' use kaha jaataa he jisaki ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji kshamta aisi ho jisase ki wo unamem se kisi ek dam par hi us dal main jagah banane main kaamyaab ho jiske liye wo khelte hai
 Another definition of 'real all-rounder' is that a player who, with his batting and bowling, constantly "helps his team win matches"
 paribhaasha ke mutabik ek vaastavik harfanmaulaa team ke liye behad durlabh or kaaphi moolyawaan khilaadi hota he kyonki wo prabhavi taur par do khilaadiyon ke rup main kaam karata he
 Sometimes confusion arises when an expert bowler performs well with the bat
 udhaaharan ke liye, west indies ke mahaan tej gendbaaj malcom marshall kai baar acchhee pari khelaa karte the, lekin ye itani baar nahin hota tha ki unhen harfanmaulaa mana jaae
 iske bajaae unhen nimna kram kaa acha ballebaaj kaha ja saktaa he
 Similarly, a specialist batsman can be called a useful change bowler and a good example of this is Alan Border, who took 11 wickets in a Test match once in 1989, when the conditions were favorable to his left-handed spin
 manyata praapt harfanmaulaa banane main pramukh baadhaon main se ek he ballebaajon or gendbaajon kaa alag-alag umr main shikhar par pahunchnaa
 ballebaaj tees saal ke aasapaas apane shikhar par tab pahunchate hai jab unki takneekee anubhav ke saath paripakv ho jaati he
 In contrast, fast bowlers often reach their peak in physical ability as well as in the course of twenty to twenty five years
 duusare gendbaaj, zyaadaatar phiraki gendbaajon or gend ko ghumaane vaale tej gendbaaj bhi apane kariyar ke aakhir main zyada asardaar hote hai
 a commonly used rule of statistics is that a player's batting average should be greater than his bowling average
 test cricket main, aise sirf teen harfanmaulaa hai jinka ballebaaji ausat unke gendbaaji ausat kii tulana main bees ank zyada hai: garfield sobers, jacks kallis or walter hamend
 haalanki, kuch duusare khilaadi bhi hai jinhone apane kariyar ke bade hisse tak yah uplabdhi hasil kii, jaise imran khan, steve wa, andru symonds or shen watasan
 daf walters ne ballebaaji ausat 48
26 or gendbaaji ausat 29
08 se apane ballebaaji or gendbaaji ausat main takreeban bees ran kaa antar hasil kar liya tha, baavjood iske ve aamtaur par kabhi-kabhaar gendbaaji karne vaale or saajhedaari todane vaale hi maane jate the, vaastavik harfanmaulaa nahin
 Overall, there are many cricketers in first-class cricket who have a very high batting average
 aankadon main bahut kam hi honge jo frank wooli ko chunauti de sakate hai jinka ballebaaji ausat 40
77 or gendbaaji ausat 19
87 tha
 Woolley has taken over 2000 wickets in his career, scoring more runs than any player except Jack Hobbs and is the only non-wicketkeeper to have caught more than 1000 catches
 kshetrarakshan kaushal kisi khilaadi kii harfanmaulaa kshamta kaa ek or mahatvapurn aadhaar mana jaataa he
 Apart from Woolley, other great fielders who are called all-rounders, W
W
 G
 Grace, Walter Hammond and Gary Sobers
 ye sabhi maidan par kaaphi chust kshetrarakshak or surakshit kaich lapakane vaale the
 Basically an all-rounder is better at bowling than batting, similarly batting is better than bowling
 bahut kam hai jo donon main hi achche hai or shaayad koi bhi nahin he jo donon main arshyachanak rup se behatar he
 This is the reason that the names "bowler allrounder" and "batsman allrounder" emerged
 udhaaharan ke liye, test cricket main kith miller kaa ballebaaji main 36
97 kaa ek acha ausat tha, or 22
97 kaa behtareen gendbaaji ausat tha, isliye unhen gendbaaj harfanmaulaa kaha jaataa he
 In contrast, Gary Sobers had a tremendous batting average of 57
78 and bowling average of 34
03, so he can be called a batsman all-rounder
 vaastavik harfanmaulaa main adarsh hai imran khan jinka ballebaaji main ausat 37 or gendbaaji main 23 kaa ausat tha, jo ek ballebaaj ke taur par bahut acha tathaa gendbaaj ke taur par behtareen he
 Sobers is considered the "greatest all-rounder of all time"
 Although statistics suggest, they were also much better in one area than the other
 unhen mukhyataur par ek mahaan ballebaaj or bahut achche gendbaaj ke taur par varnit kiya jaataa he
 His unique ability was that he could bowl medium fast bowling as well as spin balls from the wrists, while he actually joined the West Indies team as a finger ball bowler

 unhone 71
30 ke ausat se 2139 ran banaae or 12

 By 1886, Grace had achieved this kind of dual success eight times, and for the first time in 1882 another player achieved this double feat

 By writing every trick of this game, others can also analyze how the entire game was played
 shatranj ek choupaat ke upar do vyaktiyon ke liye bana khel he
 There are a total of 64 cells or squares above the square, of which 32 squares are black or other colors and 32 squares are white or other colors
 khilne vaale donon khilaadi bhi saamanytah kaala or safed kehalaate hai
 Each player has a king, wazir, two camels, two horses, two elephants and eight soldiers
 bich main raja va vajeer rahata he
 Camel on the side, horse on its side and two elephants in the last row
 unki agali rekha main aath paidal yaa sainik rahete hai
 While keeping the square, it is noted that the food on the right side of both the players should be white and instead of the wazir, the black wazir should be in black squares and the white wazir should be in white squares
 khel kii shuruyaat hameshaa safed khilaadi se kii jaati he
 Chess is one of the oldest and most popular boards, played by two opponents on a square board, which consists of two different colors of custom made white and black pieces
 safed pehle chalata he, jiske baad kheladi nirdhaarit niyamon ke anusaar ek ke baad ek chaalen chalate hai
 The players then make an attempt to defeat the king, the chief of the opposition, the king

 Moves either go to an empty square or occupy an opponent's piece and remove it from the game
 khilaadi koi bhi aisi chaal nahin chal sakate jisase unka raja hamale main aa jaye
 If the player has no valid moves left, the game is over; This is either a check - if the king is under attack - or a deadlock or check - if the king is not under attack

 If the opponent's piece is diagonally on an adjacent line in front of it, the pawn can occupy that piece
 pyaadaa do vishesh chaal, "en pasaant" or "padonnati-chaal " bhi chal saktaa he
 An old saying in Hindi is based on this special trick of walking - "fear the fake from pawn, go twinkle!" raja kisi bhi disha main ek khaane main ja saktaa he, raja ek vishesh chaal bhi chal saktaa he jo "caseling" kahi jaati he or isamen hathi bhi shaamil he
 If the king is forced to walk and cannot walk on any side, then assume that the game is over

 Much of the work related to psychologist Albert Bandura, who introduced and studied social learning theory, showed that children can learn aggression from their role models through observational learning, during which there is no change in their open behavior and It can be considered a sub internal process

 duusari film main bacchon ke duusare samooh ne dekha ki us ladke ko uskaa aakraamak vyavhaar ke liye dandit kiya gaya
 In the third film, the third group of children saw that the boys were neither rewarded nor punished
 Thus three groups of children were shown three different films
 filmein dekhne ke baad sabhi bacchon ko ek alag praayogic kaksh main bithakar unhen vibhinn prakaar ke khilaunon se khilne ke liye swatantra chhod diya gaya or un samoohon ko chhipakar dekha gaya or unke vyavhaaron ko note kiya gaya
 Those who found that children who had seen aggressive behavior towards toys in the film were rewarding were the most aggressive towards toys
 sabase kam aakraamakata un bacchon ne dikhain jinhone film main aakraamak vyavhaar ko dandit hote hue dekha tha
 This experiment makes it clear that all children learned aggression from the events depicted in the film and also imitated the model
