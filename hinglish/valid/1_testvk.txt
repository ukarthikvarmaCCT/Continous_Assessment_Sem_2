 The pure methods of time measurement by the solar clock in Surya Siddhanta are described in Chapters 3 and 13

 The construction method of these clocks consisted of tying a large pillar to one end and burying it in the ground and estimating the time from the shadow of the column lying on the ground along with the sun's rotation

 For the correct functioning of solar clocks, it was necessary that they be installed at the right places
 vishwa ke alag-alag sthanon par ek hi samay par surya bhinn dishaao main hota tha, isliye surya kii disha ke anusaar ghadiyon ko sthapit karnaa hota tha
 One way to do this is to set up the solar clock in such a way that the shadows look straight when the sun is in the middle of the sky

 Fortunately, he was caught sight of Emperor Bimbisara's son Kumar Abhay

 The child was named - Jeevak

 When Jeevak grew up, one day he suddenly asked Abhay Kumar, 'who are my parents?' Abhay Kumar was surprised at his question but thought that it would not be right to hide anything from Jeevak
 usne use sari baat bataa di ki kis tarah vah use jangal main padaa mila tha
 The creature said, 'where should i go with the burden of selflessness?' On this, Abhay Kumar tied him up and said, 'vats, instead of being unhappy about this thing, go to Taxila and study there concentrated and give light of your knowledge to the society
 ' jeevak vidyadhyayan ke liye takshashila chal padaa

 Jeevak worked hard there and earned the title of Ayurvedacharya
 uske acharya chaahate the ki vah magadh jaae or vahaan rahakar logon kii seva kare
 Jeevak was constantly troubled by the same old question
 use pareshaan dekhakar acharya ne poocha, 'vatsa tum is tarah udhaas kyon ho?' is par jeevak ne uttar diya, 'acharya aap jaanate hai ki meraa koi kul or gotra nahin he
 Wherever i go, people will point fingers at me
 kya aap mujhe yahaan apane paas nahin rakh sakate, taaki main aapaki seva karata rahun

 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya
 maury samrajya ke vistaar evam use shaktishaalee banane kaa shrey samraat ashok ko jaataa he
 This empire started in the Magadha kingdom in the east from the plains of the river Ganges
 isaki rajdhani patliputra thi
 Chandragupta Maurya founded this empire in 322 BC and rapidly developed his empire towards the west
 usne kai chote chote kshetreey rajyon ke aapasi matbhedon kaa phayda uthaaya jo sikandar ke akraman ke baad paidaa ho gayi the
 By 316 BCE, the Maurya dynasty had captured the whole of North Western India

 But the then Emperor Ghananand of Magadha turned him down

 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India
 magadh par kabja hone ke baad chandragupta satta ke kendra par kaabiz ho chukaa tha
 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India
 isaki jaankaree apratyaksh saakshyon se milti he
 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"

 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them

 He sent his son Mahendra from the capital Pataliputra through the Sri Lanka waterway
 patna kaa aitihaasik mahendru ghat usee ke naam par namakrit he
 Emperor Ashoka maintained a large army even after the war broke out
 aisa videshi akraman se samrajya ke patan ko rokane ke liye aavashyak tha
 The capital of the Maurya Empire was Pataliputra
 iske atirikt samrajya ko prashasan ke liye chaar or praanton main baanta gaya tha
 Tausali was the capital of the eastern part and Suvarnagiri of the southern part
 isi prakaar uttari tathaa pashchimi bhaag kii rajdhani kramshah takshashila tathaa ujjain thi
 Apart from this, Samapa, Ishila and Kaushambi were also important cities

 There was a Council of Ministers and Mahamatyas in every province to help Kumar

 Each district was divided into village groups
 pradeshik jila prashasan kaa pradhan hota tha
 The rope was used to measure the ground
 prashasan kii sabase choti ikai gaanv thi jiskaa pradhan graamic kehalaata tha
 Kautilya has written an entire chapter in economics about the administration of cities
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki us samay patliputra tathaa anya nagaron kaa prashasan is sinddhant ke anuroop hi rahaa hoga
 Megasthenes describes the administration of Pataliputra
 uske anusaar patliputra nagar kaa shashan ek nagar parishad dwaara kiya jaataa tha jisamen 30 sadsy the
 These thirty members were divided into six committees with five members each
 prayek samiti kaa kuch nishchit kaam hota tha
 The work of the first committee was related to industrial and artistic production
 iskaa kaam vetan nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa milawat rokna bhi tha
 The second committee looked into the affairs of people coming from outside in Pataliputra, especially foreigners
 teesri samiti kaa taalluk janm tathaa mrityu ke panjikaran se tha
 The fourth committee regulated trade and commerce
 iskaa kaam nirmit maal kii bikri tathaa panya par nazar rakhana tha
 The fifth was to keep an eye on the manufacture of goods, and the sixth work was to be done
 nagar parishad ke dwaara janakalyaan ke kaary karne ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke adhikari bhi niyukt kiye jate the, jaise - sadakon, bazaaron, chikitsaalayon, devalayon, shiksha-sansthaaon, jalaapurti, bandargahon kii marammat tathaa rakrakhaav kaa kaam karnaa
 The principal officer of the city was called Nagark
 kautilya ne nagar prashasan main kai vibhaagon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jo nagar ke kai kaaryakalapon ko niyamit karte the, jaise - lekha vibhaag, rajasav vibhaag, khan tathaa khanij vibhaag, rath vibhaag, seemaa shulk or kar vibhaag
 Another thing which was unprecedented in India during the Maurya Empire was the Mauryo's intelligence trap
 us samay puure rajya main guptcharon kaa jaal bicha diya gaya tha jo rajya par kisi bahari akraman yaa aantarik vidroh kii khabar prashasan tathaa sena tak pahunchaate the
 National political unity was established in India only during the reign of Maurya dynasty
 maury prashasan main satta kaa sudrudh kendriyakaran tha parantu raja nirankush nahin hota tha
 During the Mauryan period, the Republic declined and the political system was strengthened
 kautilya ne rajya sapthank siddhanth nirdisht kiya tha, jinke aadhaar par maury prashasan or uski grih tathaa videsh niti sanchalit hoti thi - raja, amaatya janapad, durg, kosh, sena or, mitra
 One result of the establishment of such a large empire was that there was economic integration throughout the empire

 -- mahatma gandhi, satya ke prayog, aatmakatha The main three elements in India's ancient education system can be considered - yahi gurukul shiksha-pranali kaa mul rup he
 In the dark India of the 19th century, sage Dayanand's country was very extensive among the nobles who awakened the light of awakening
 ve yug-pravartak rishi the, jinhone shiksha, raajnneeti, samaaj-sanghathan aadi sab kshetron main nae vichaaron kaa sandesh diya
 Rishi Dayanand experienced many defects in the education system prevalent in his time and presented the ancient Arya education system
 rishi ne use 'gurukul shiksha-pranali' kaa naam diya
 There were mainly two systems of education prevalent in India during his time - one was started by the British rulers of India and the other was prevalent in the Pandit congregation according to the old tradition
 sarkaar dwaara prachlit pranali bharat ke rashtriya tathaa dharmik aadarshon kepratikul thi
 In it, the language, religion, civilization, literature and culture of India were completely ignored
 pandit mandali kii shiksha-paddati samay kii aavashyaktaaon ko purna nahin karti thi usamen vartmaan yug ke gyaan-vigyaanon ko koi sthaan praapt nahin hi tha vah paakhandon kaa poshan karti thi
 The ideals that are required for character building, celibacy, renunciation, asceticism, etc
 were not important in both systems
 rishi dayanand ne anubhav kiya ki bharat main pracheen gurukul pranali kaa punaruddhar kar in dosha ko dur kiya janaa chahie
 He presented the ideals and principles of education in the third community of 'satyarth Prakash' - Undoubtedly, the thoughts of Rishi Dayanand were very revolutionary ideas in the field of education
 rishi dayanand ke ek pramukh shishy mahatma munshi ram ne san 1897 main unhone gurukul ko prarambh karne kii aavashyaktaa ke nimnlikhit kaaran bataae - In the 19th century, two types of education were prevalent in India
 pehali paddati british sarkaar dwaara apane shashan kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye viksit kii gai sarkari skulon or vishvavidhyalayon kii pranali thi or duusari sanskrit, vyakaran, darshan aadi bhartiya vaanmay kii vibhinn vidyaon ko pracheen paramparaagat vidhi se adhyayan karne kii paathshaala paddati
 There were some serious flaws in both methods
 pehali paddati main paurasty gyanvigyaan kii ghor apeksha thi or yah sarvatha arashtriya thi
 Lord Macaulay, who was an ardent proponent of this and enforced it by his well-known memorial in 1835, believed that 'the importance of books lying in one of the almari of a good European library was equal to the entire literature of India and Arabia'
 at: sarkari shiksha paddati main bhartiya vaanmay kii ghor upeksha karte hue angreji tathaa paashchaatya sahitya or gyaan vigyaan ke adhyayan par bal diya gaya
 The main objective of this education system was, in Macaulay's words, 'to create a group of Indians who are Indian in color and blood, but English in terms of interest, temper and pickle'
 isliye yah shikshapaddati bharat ke rashtriya or dharmik aadarshon ke pratikul thi
 The second education system was the school system practiced in Panditamandali
 isamen yadhyapi bhartiya vaanmay kaa adhyayan karaayaa jaataa tha, tathaapi usamen naveen tathaa vartmaan samay ke liye aavashyak gyaan vigyaan kii ghor upeksha thi
 At that time the great need of the country was to develop a national education system in harmony with the excellent elements of both education systems while coordinating the puerile and western knowledge science
 is mahatvapurn kaary kaa sampann karne main gurukul kongdi ne bada sahyog diya
 Mahatma Munshiram, the founder of the Gurukul, was greatly influenced by the educational ideas propounded in the famous book 'satyarth Prakash' by Maharishi Dayanand, the originator of the Aryasamaj, who had extraordinary significance in the Indian cultural renaissance of the last century
 unhone 1897 main apane patr 'saddharm prachaarak' dwaara gurukul shiksha pranali ke punarudwar kaa prabal andolan aarambh kiya
 On 30 October 1898, he laid out a detailed plan for it
 november, 1898 i
 main punjab ke aryasamaajon ke kendriya sanghathan arya pratinidhi sabha ne gurukul kholane kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya or mahatma munshiram ne yah pratigya kii ki ve is kaary ke liye, jab tak 30,000 rupaya ekatra nahin kar lenge, tab tak apane ghar main pair nahin rakhenge
 Under the circumstances, he completed this daunting task in eight months with his relentless industry and unwavering loyalty
 16 may 1900 ko punjab ke gujaranvaala sthaan par ek vaidic paathshaala ke saath gurukul kii sthapana kar di gai
 But Mahatma Munshiram did not find this place suitable
 ve shukla yajurveda ke ek mantra 'uphvare girinan sangame c nadinaan
 According to Dhia Wipro Ajayat 'they wanted a place near river and mountain
 isi samay nazibabad ke dharmanishth rais munshi amansingh ji ne is kaary ke liye mahatma munshiram ji ko 1,200 bighas kaa apana kangri gram daan diya
 The Kangri land surrounded by densely forested forests on the banks of the Ganges in the Himalayas was ideal for Gurukuls
 at: yahan ghaney jangal saaf kar kuch chappar banaae gaye or holi ke din somvaar, 4 march 1902 ko gurukul gujaranvaala se kangri laayaa gaya
 The Gurukul was started in some thatched huts with 34 students

 Its college department started in 1907 AD

 Taking inspiration from it in different parts of the country, many gurukuls following its ideals and curriculum were established

 In 1935 AD, a separate Vidyasabha was organized to manage it under Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Punjab
 gurukul shiksha paddati kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai- vidhyaarthiyon kaa guruon ke sampark main, unke kul yaa parivaar kaa ang banakar rahanaa, bahmacharyapurvak saral evam tapasyamay jivan bitaana, charitranirmaan or shaareerik vikaas par bauddhik evam maansik vikaas kii bhanti puraa dhyaan dena, shiksha main sanskrit ko anivaary bananaa, vaidic vaanmay ke adhyayan par bal dena, shiksha kaa madhyak maatrubhaasha hindi ko bananaa, sanskrit, darshan, veda aadi pracheen vishyon ke adhyayan ke saath aadhunik paashchaatya gyaan vigyaan or angreji kii padhai tathaa rashtriyata kii bhaavana
 Nowadays these characteristics have become universally accepted, but at the beginning of this century all these ideas were completely revolutionary, new and original
 gurukul shiksha kii katipay visheshtaayen nimnlikhit he: From the very beginning, all subjects were taught in Hindi through Hindi medium
 vigyaan, ganit, paashchaatya darshan aadi vishay bhi hindi main hi padhaaye jate the
 When the college department opened in 1907, Hindi was kept as a medium
 us samay hindi main ucch shiksha dena ek asambhav baat samajhi jaati thi
 Gurukul showed this by turning it into action
 us samay aadhunik vidwaanon kii pustaken hindi main nahin thi
 The Gurukul students first worked in this field and many Gurukul texts were published
 pro maheshacharan singh kii 'hindi chemistry', pro saathe kaa 'vikaswad', shriyut govardhan kii 'bhautikee' or 'rasayan' pro ramshrandas saxena kaa 'gunatmak vishleshan', pro sinha kaa 'vanaspatishaastra' pro prannath kaa 'arthshaastra', 'rashtriya aay-vyay shaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', pro baalkrishna kaa 'arthshaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', or pro sudhakar kaa 'manovigyaan' hindi main apane-apane vishay ke pehle granth hai
 The creation of scientific texts in Hindi was started by Gurukul
 in vaigyanik granthon ke atirikt anya bhi bahut se ucchkoti ke granth gurukul dwaara prakashit hue
 Prof
 Ramdev did his basic research on Indian history and published his famous 'history of India'
 mahatma munshi raamji ne bhi vividh dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kar moulik granth likhe
 In 1918, the President of the University of Calcutta, Dr
 Sadler, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, visited Gurukul
 gurukul kaa avlokan karke ve bahut prabhavit hue
 He expressed his views regarding Gurukul in one of his letters - us yug ke ek prasiddh vidwaan shri nivas shastri ucch shiksha ke madhyam ke rup main angreji ke k͠r samarthak the, par gurukul kaa kaary santoshprad paane par unhone kaha - 'meraa apana vichaar yah rahaa he ki vidhyalay vibhaag main shiksha kaa madhyam bhartiya bhashaayen hi rahani chahie, parantu mahavidhyalay vibhaag kii padhai angreji ke madhyam dwaara honi chahie
 But now seeing the Gurukul, i am moving away from this idea of mine
 maikale ke baad bharat main shiksha ke kshetra main jo sabase mahatvapurn or moulik praytn hua, vah gurukul he - remje macdnold The great curiosity of Gurukul Kangri was to make these ideas acceptable by his functional test
 pehle yah asambhav samajha jaataa tha ki hindi ucch shiksha evam vaigyanik vishyon ke adhyayan adhyaapan kaa madhyam ban sakati he
 Gurukul first made this idea possible in modern India through his trial
 yahan adhyapakon tathaa praadhyaapakon ne rasayan, bhautik vigyaan, vanaspati shaastra, manovigyaan, vikaswad aadi vishyon par hindi main pehali pustaken likhin
 The scientific writing of Hindi got a great boost from the fact that Gurukul Kangdi made Hindi a medium for education in all subjects including science and accordingly 17 books were also implemented
 maatrubhaasha dwaara shiksha ke is pareekshan ko dekhne ke liye 1918 i
 main kalakatta vishvavidhyalay ayog ne pradhan dow sadler, sar ashutosh mukherjee, shrinivas shastri aadi mahanubhav yahan par padhaare or mahavidhyalay vibhaag kii shiksha ke liye angreji kaa madhyam anivaary rup se banaae rakhane ke sambandh main unke evam desh ke anya shikshashastriyon ke vichaaron main moulik parivartan hua
 The Gurukul participated prominently in all national and social reform movements
 hindi sahitya ko anek yashasvi patrkaar, lekhak or saahitiyik pradaan kiye
 The practice of Sanskrit and Vedic poetry gave special encouragement to teaching and learning
 is gurukul se nikle hue snaatak hindi ke pratham shrenee ke lekhak siddh hue or unhone hindi ko mahamoolyawaan sahitya diya
 Prominent among them were Indra Vidyavachaspati, Prannath Vidyalankar, Satyaketu Vidyalankar, Jaydev Sharma Vidyalankar, Jayachand Vidyalankar, Chandragupta Vedalankar and Acharya Ramdev
 samprati gurukul kangri main vedavedang, sanskrit, darshanashastra, itihaas, raajnneeti, ayurveda, krishi tathaa vaigyanik vishyon kii ucch shiksha kaa prabandh he
 For this, Veda College, Arts College, Ayurveda College, Agricultural School and Science College are organized

 Those who have to stay in school ashram, they have to study Sanskrit grammar etc

 paramparaagat rup se kashmir kaa sahitya sanskrit main tha
 Below are the names of prominent Sanskrit writers of Kashmir: pichley 800 varsh kashmiri bhashaa or ab urdu or hindi main bhi yahaan sahitya kii rachana hui he
 The first specimen of Kashmiri literature is found in the great omnipotent "sarvochara Deshbhasha" of "shitikanth"
 sambhavat: shaiva sidhon ne hi pehle kashmiri ko shaiva darshan kaa loksulabh madhyam banaaya or baad main dhire-dhire iskaa loksahitya bhi likhit rup dhaaran karata gaya
 However, due to continuous deprivation of national and cultural shelter, the full development of its capabilities remained stagnant
 kuch bhi ho, 14veen shatee tak kashmiri bhashaa bolchaal ke atirikt lokdarshan or loksamskruti kaa bhi madhyam ban chuki thi or jab ham lal-vaakh kii bhashaa ko "banasuravadh" kii bhashaa se adhik manja hua pate hai to maukhik parampara kii gatishiltaa main hi iskaa kaaran khojna padataa he
 Santwani, Bhakti Geet, Spirituality, Pranaygeet, Vivahgeet, Shramgeet, Kridagit, Ladishah, and folklore are particularly rich in Kashmiri folklore
 "sufiana kalam" naam kii sangeet kritiyon main bhi loksahitya kaa swar sunai padataa he
 The vision of development can be considered as the five periods of Kashmiri literature: is kaal main santon kii muktak vaani pradhan rahi jisamen shaiva darshan, tasawwuf, sahjopasna, sadachaar, aadhyaatmasaadhana, pakhandpratirodh tathaa aadambaratyaag kaa pratipaadan or pravachan hi adhik rahaa, samvedansheel abhivyakti kam
 Among the compositions of this work, only the great light of Shitikanth, the recitation of an unknown Shaiva saint, the speech of Lalidad, the verses of Nundaryo "sh" and others, have been achieved till now
 inamen se bhi pratham do rachanaaon main kashmiri chhandon ko sanskrit ke chaukhate main kasakar prastut kiya gaya he; haan, chhumman sampradaay main kashmiri chhandon se adhik kashmiri "sutara" paae jate hai jo shaiva sidhon dwaara kashmiri bhashaa ke lokgrahya upyog kii ore nishchit sanket karte hai
 In the chronological works of this period, mythological and temporal narratives found shelter in poetry
 visheshkar sultan jain-ul-aabidin ke protsaahan se kuch charitkavy likhe gaye or sangitatmak kritiyon kii rachana bhi hui
 a khandakavya and a voyeur based on the life of the Sultan were also composed; But sorry, none of these works are available now
 keval bhattavatar kaa banasuravadh praapt hua he jo harivansh main varnit ushaa aniruddh kii pranaygatha par aadhaarit hote hue bhi swatantra rachana he, visheshkar chhandyojna main
 One more composition of this period is found; The sorrow of the Sultan's grandson Hasan Shah, the court poet Ganak Prastha, in which the rendition of the rite of life after the commendation of the refugee
 lokajeevan ke harshavishaad kaa vishvajaneen bhavchitran is gatipradhan kaal kii manoram visheshta he
 Its "artha" and "iti" are now "khatoon and A" Renimal whose Vedasanadas hear the compassionate sargam of union of folk life, which belongs to each and every one
 1600 i
 ke aasapaas is sargam se sufi rahasyavaad kaa swar bhi kii geetikaon main foot padaa or 1650 i
 ke lagbhag lalakavy kii bhi udbhaavna hui
 Most of the "sufiana Kalam" seems to have been composed in this period
 chandovidhan main nae prayog bhi is kaal kii ek vishesh dein hai
 In this period, the combination of Prabandha and Pragya was confirmed by the mythical Pranayakavya and Premamarga Masnavi poetry
 ek ore ramcharita, krishnalila, parvatiparinay, damayanti swanyavar aadi aakhyaanon par maarmik leelakavy rache gaye to duusari ore farsi masanaviyon ke roopantaran ke atirikt arabi, urdu or punjabi premakhyanon se bhi saamagree lee gai; saath hi kuch aise dharmik prageeton kii bhi rachana hui jinamein loukik tathaa alokik prem ke sanshlisht chithran ke saath-saath paariwarik vednaa kaa pratifalan bhi hua he
 Special notable among the compositions of this period are the Akanandun of Ramzan Butt; Ramayana of Prakashram; Mahmood Gami's Sheerin Khusrav, Laila Majnu and Yusuf Zulekha; Rada Swayamvad of Parmanand, Shevilgan and So "damacharyath; Waliullah Mattoo and Zarifshah's Sahkriti Homal; Maqbool Shah Kralwari's Gulrej; Azizullah Haqqani's Mumtaz Benazir; Krishna Razdan's Sh" Valgan; And the enactment of l'khyan Bath Nagam "bulbul"
 is kaal main kashmir ke saamaajik saanskrithik jivan ne bhi aadhuniktaa kii angadaai lee or bharat ke duusare pradeshon kii saahitiyik pragati se prabhavit hokar yahan ke kaviyon ne bhi nai jagriti kaa swaagat kiya
 Gradually, the national tone of Kashmiri poetry became higher and the live music of the new activity of social and cultural life also echoed
 wahaab pare ke shahnamaa, maqbool ke greestynama or rasul mir kii ghazal ne is jaagran kaal kii purvapithika baandhi, mahjur ne isaki prabhati gaai or aaazaad ne naveen chetana dekar ise duusare pradeshon ke bhartiya sahitya kaa sakriy sahyogi bana diya
 In terms of progressive development, there are four stages of this modern period: pehle charan main sufi padaavalee kii ghisi pity parampara ne hi maanavvaad kii halki si ganj paidaa kii or aitihaasik masavaniyon ne apane yug kaa paroksh chithran bhi pratibimbit kiya
 In the second phase, the spirit of patriotism arose and in the third the political and national consciousness was enhanced and the tone of humanism was raised
 chauthe charan main kashmiri kavita ne nai karavatein leen
 For the first two years, the enthusiasm of the enemy's resistance and the preservation of new independence kept echoing
 uske pashchaat nae kashmir ke nirmaan kii moolbhoot apekshaaon ko puraa karne ke liye aarthik prajatantr kii sthapana or vishvashanti kii pratishtha par jor diya jane laga
 Not only poems on such important subjects, Gitanatya and dance songs were also composed
 lokgeeton kii style ko apnaane ke nae-nae prayog bhi hue or chandovidhan main baari parivartan aayaa
 In the second phase, the trend of nature painting was aroused in that fourth phase, which inspired a new artistry and developed a synthetic style of sociocultural depiction in the natural environment
 "mahjur" or "aaazaad" ke baad "master ji", "aarif", "naadim", "roshan", "raahi", "kaami", "premi" or "almast" ne is disha main vishesh yoga diya
 Nowadays "firaq", "chaman", "bekas", "azim", "kundan", "saqi" and "khyal" are special remedies
 "faazil", "ambaradaar" or "faani" bhi apane-apane rang main prageeton kii sarjana kar rahe hai
 Kashmiri prose is not developing due to lack of journalism
 radiyon or kuch masikon kaa sahaara paakar yadhyapi naatak, kahani, vaarta or niabandh avashya likhe ja rahe hai; par jab tak kashmiri kaa koi dainik saptaahik nahin nikalataa, kashmiri gadhy kaa vikaas sandigdh hi rahegaa
 Still, there is no shortage of writers
 kahanikaron main akhtar muhiuddin, amin kamil, somnath jutshi, ali mohammad lone, deepak kaal, avatarakrishna rahabar, sufi gulam mohammad, hriday kaul bharti, umesh kaul or bansi nirdosh vishesh sakriy hai
 Among the playwrights "roshan", "zutshi", "lone", Pushkar Bhan and "kamil", and among the novelists "akhtar", "lone" and "kamil" can be named
 prakaashan kii suvidha mili to bison upanyaas chap jaaen
 The Kashmiri language has not found proper place in the school education

 This area has been considered as Dev Bhoomi and Tapobhoomi
 maanasakhand kaa kurmaanchal va kumaanun naam chand raajaaon ke shashan kaal main prachlit hua
 The rule of Chand kings on Kurmanchal started after Katyuris and it continued till 1790

 The Gurkhas ruled Kumaon from 1790 to 1815

 angrez sena ne nepal kii gorkha sena ko dehradun ke sameep san 1815 main antim rup se parrast kar diya
 But due to the inability of the then Maharaja of Garhwal to pay the prescribed amount of war expenses, the British did not hand over the entire Garhwal state of Garhwal and included the former part of Alaknanda Mandakini under the rule of East India Company and only the Tehri Maharaja of Garhwal was included

 Uma, the daughter of Anisar Daksha Prajapati of a legend, was married to Shiva
 shiv ko daksh prajapati pasand nahin karte the, parantu yah devataaon ke aagrah ko taal nahin sakate the, isliye unhone apni putree kaa vivaah na chaahate hue bhi shiv ke saath kar diya tha
 Once Daksha Prajapati called all the gods in a yagna, but did not even give the invitation to his son-in-law Shiva and daughter Uma
 uma hath kar is yajna main pahaunchi
 She became very sad when she saw her father's yagna in Haridwar in the yagna of her father honoring all the gods and being her husband and her humiliation
 yajna ke havankund main yah kehete hue kud padi ki 'main agle janm main bhi shiv ko hi apana pati banaaungi
 As a result of the humiliation of myself and my husband - i burn my sacrificial fire in the Havan Kund of the Yagya
 ' jab shiv ko yah gyaat hua ki uma sati ho gayi, to unke krodh kaa parawar na rahaa
 He destroyed and corrupted the Yajna of Daksha Prajapati through his Ganas
 sabhi devi - devtaa shiv ke is raudra - rup ko dekhakar soch main pad gaye ki shiv pralay na kar daalen
 Therefore the Gods and Goddesses prayed to Mahadev Shiva and pacified his anger
 daksh prajapati ne bhi kshamaa maangi
 Shiva also blessed them

 He started traveling in the sky by putting Sati's burnt body on the shoulder

 khaas vansh ke baad yahaan kachudi vansh kaa shashan hua tathaa is vansh kaa raja ashok malla, balban kaa samakaleen tha
 During this period, Pithoragarh was established by King Pithora and Pithoragarh was also named after him

 From 1622 onwards Pithoragarh was ruled by the Chand dynasty
 pithauragarh ke itihaas kaa ek anya vivaadaaspad varnan he
 According to Atkins, Pir Gosai, a feudal of the Chand dynasty, founded Pithoragarh
 aisa lagata he ki chand vansh ke raja bharti chand ke shasankaal main uske putr ratna chand ne nepal ke raja doti ko parrast kar saura ghati par adhikaar kar liya evam varsh 1449 main ise kumaun yaa kurmaanchal main mila liya
 During his reign, Piru or Prithvi Gosain built a fort here named Pithoragarh
 kile ke naam par hi baad main iskaa naam pithauragarh hua
 The Chandas extended their authority over most of Kumaon where they ruled until the year 1790
