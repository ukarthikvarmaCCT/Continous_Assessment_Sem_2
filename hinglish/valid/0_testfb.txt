 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable

 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "point of view" and a rising voice means "point of view"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Where symbols are visual in pairs, the first corresponds to the common American pronunciation of American English, the second corresponds to the received pronunciation of British English

, many animal names and many common Activities jarmenic shabd angreji ke latin shabdon se zyada chote hote hai or saamaanya bolchaal main inkaa upyog zyada aam he
 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface
 aisa anumaan he kii lagbhag 25,000 shabd har saal bhashaa main judate hai
 One consequence of the French influence is that the English vocabulary has been somewhat divided into Germanic and Latin words
 angreji ke 1000 sabase aam shabdon main se 83% or 100 sabase aam main se puure 100 jarmenic hai
 Conversely, most of the more advanced words in subjects like science, philosophy, mathematics come from Latin or Greek

 The spelling system, or orthography, is multi-layered
 isamen sthaneey jarmenic pranali ke upar french, greek or latin vartanee ke tatv shaamil hai; bhashaa ke dhwani vigyaan se yah kaaphi hat gaya he
 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words
 haalaanki akshar or dhwani algaav main mail nahin khate hai, phir bhi shabd sanrachana, dhwani or lahazon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaye gaye vartanee niyam 75% vishwasaneey hai
 Some phonetic spelling advocates claim that English is more than 80% phonetic

 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main 
debor, cafe, resyum, entry, fiansi or nive jaise shabd aksar donon tareekon se likhe jate hai
 The diacritics are often added to the word to denote them of "high order"

 Some English words retain diacritics to distinguish themselves
 udahaaran, animé, exposé, lamé, öre, øre, pâté, piqué, and rosé, haalaanki aksar inako chhod bhi diya jaataa he

 Eg, maté, from Spanish yerba mate) duniya bhar ke shikshit angreji vaktaaon dwaara lagbhag saarvbhaumik rup se sweekrut bhashaa ke ek sanskaran ko aupchaarik likhit angreji kaha jaataa he
 Its written type remains the same almost everywhere, in contrast to which the English language differs according to dialects, accents, types of slang, local and regional expressions

 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar
 yah bhashaa angreji ke ek sarlikrut sanskaran par aadhaarit he
 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa

 british counsil jaisi santhaayen is angrezi ke prasar ke liye tarah-tarah ke dushprachaar evam gupt abhiyaan karti rahati hai
 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 When the education of Pandava and Kaurava princes was completed, they wanted to give Guru Dakshina to Dronacharya
 dronacharya ko drupad ke dwaara kiye gayi apane apmaan kaa samaran ho aayaa or unhone rajkumaron se kaha, "rajkumaron! yadi tum gurudakshina dena hi chaahate ho to paanchal naresh drupad ko bandi bana kar mere samaksh prastut karo
 This will be your Gurudakshina
 " gurudev ke is prakaar kehane par samast rajkumaar apane-apane astr-shastr le kar paanchal desh kii ore chale
 On reaching Panchal, Arjuna said to Dronacharya, "gurudev! You first allow the Kauravas to fight with King Drupada
 yadi ve drupad ko bandi banane main asafal rahe to ham pandav yuddh karenge
 "on getting the permission of the Guru, the Kauravas led by Duryodhana attacked Panchal

 Both i and my kingdom are now subject to you, now do whatever you wish
 " dronacharya ne kaha, "tumne kaha tha ki mitrataa samaan varg ke logon main hoti he
 Therefore, i am returning half of your kingdom to you in order to maintain a friendly spirit with you
 " itnaa kah kar dronacharya ne ganga nadi ke dakshini tat kaa rajya drupad ko saunp diya or shesh ko swayan rakh liya

 That devaswarpa girl is worthy of you all the same

 The king-maharaja and Prince of many countries were present in the Swayamvara Sabha, soon after, Princess Draupadi arrived in that meeting with her brother Dhrishtadyumna in hand
 dhridhyumna ne sabha ko sambodhit karte huye kaha, "vibhinn desh se padhaare raja-maharaajaaon evam anya ganmaanya jano se meri bahan draupadi kaa vivaah hoga
 " ek ke baad ek sabhi raja-maharaja evam rajkumaron ne ek upar gumti hui machhlee kii aankh pra uske pratibimb ko neeche jal main dekhakar nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi or ve kantiheen hokar apane sthaan main laut aaye
 These unsuccessful people included Jarasandha, Shalya, Shishupala and Duryodhana, Kauravas etc
 kauravon ke asafal hone par karn ne nishaanaa saadhane ke liye jaise hi dhanush uthaaya ,tabhi draupadi ne shri krishna ke ishaare par karn ko sut putr kahkar vivaah ke liye manaa kar diya

 a fierce battle ensued between the Pandavas and the Kshatriya kings
 pandav draupadi ko saath le kar vahaan pahunche jahaan ve apni mata kunti ke saath nivas kar rahe the
 Arjun called out from the gate and said to his mother, "mother! Today we have come with a wonderful begging for you
 " us par kunti ne bheetar se hi kaha, "putron! tum log aapas main mil-baant uskaa upbhog kar lo
 "later on knowing that the beggar was in the form of a bride, Kunti was deeply repentant but Draupadi accepted the five Pandavas as her husband to prove the mother's words to be true
 pandavon ke draupadi ko saath le kar apane nivas par pahunchne ke kuch kaal pashchaat unke peeche-peeche krishna bhi vahaan par aa pahunche
 After the formalities were completed, Kunti said to Draupadi, "draupadi! First take out the parts of the gods
 phir brahmanon ko do
 Then separate the fraction of dependents
 uske baad jo shesh bache uskaa aadha bhaag bhim ko or shesh aadha bhaag ham sabhi ko apni deh paroso

 news time bharat main prakashit hone vaala angreji bhashaa kaa ek samachar patr he

 yahaan tirth yatriyon ke thaharne kii vyavastha he
 Every year thousands of tourists arrive here
 vaah ! life ho to aisi 2005 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 In Sanskrit literature, for poetry, the use of words like ornamentation, poetry, linguistics, activity etc
 is found
 inamen alankarishastra shabd sarvaadhik prachlit mana jaataa he
 The ancient masters like Bhamah, Vamana and Utbhata have used the word Kavyalankar in the names of the texts related to poetry
 ise alankarishastra kehane ke do kaaran ho sakate hai
 One, the ancient Acharyas have embraced all the beautiful religions with the word ornament
 duusare pracheen aacharyon kii dharna thi ki alankaar hi kavy main pradhan he
 For this reason, the poetical discourse was named Alankarshastra
 acharya bhamah ke 'shabdaarthu sahitau kavyam' is kavyalakshan se aacharyon ko pashchaat kaal main sahitya shabd kii prerana mili
 Unlike all these names, one name has been used for this scripture and that is 'karyakalpa', its instruction comes in the sixty four arts counted in the Kamsastra of Vatsyayana
 iske tikaakar jaimanglark ne kriyakalp shabd ko kriyakalp iti ‘‘kavyakaranvidhih kaavyalankar ityarthh’’ is arth main kiya he
 It appears that the term used under the arts is used in the sense of poetry, but this name did not become very popular
 acharya vatsyayan ne saadhaaran adhikaran main prastut vidhyasamuddesh prakaran main kriyakalp kaa ullekh kiya
 Kriyakalpa means the art of knowledge of poetry
 kavy ke shaastra vishyak vichaar ke pravartan ke sandarbh main kavyamimasaakaar rajasekhar ne apane kavyashastreey praudh granth kavyamimasaa main puranic aadhaar kaa aashray liya he
 According to this description, Lord Shrikanth gave the first sermon of poetry, Parmeshti and Vaikuntha etc
 to his sixty four disciples
 is vidya kaa dwitiya baar upadesh bhagwaan parameshthi dwaara unke ichhajanya shishyon ko diya gaya jinamein devvandh saraswati kaa putr kavypurush bhi ek tha
 Knowing the Kavyapurusha with trikala Yajna and divine vision, Brahma commanded him to propagate poetry in the land and heaven dwellers with the wishes of the common man
 kavypurush ne kavyavidya ko attharah bhaagon main vibhakt kar sahastraksh aadi divya snaatakon ko updisht kiya
 Those disciples got special merit in poetry in separate parts and made separate books
 in snaatakon main sahastraksh ne kavirahasy, uktigarbha ne auktik, suvarnanabh ne ritinirnay, prachetha ne anuprasic, yama ne yamak, chitrangad ne chitra, shesh ne shabdashlesh, pultsay ne vastav, aupkaayan ne aupmy, parashar ne atishay, utthy ne arthshlesh, kuber ne ubhayalankarkarika, kaamdev ne vainodic, bharat ne roopak nirnay, upamanyu ne gunoupadanik tathaa kuchumar ne aupnishadik naamak pruthak pruthak granth likhe
 In this way, Rajasekhar tried to throw light on the origin of poetry
 is aakhyaan main kavyashastra kii daivi utpatti sweekaar kii gayi he
 The narrative of the origins of poetry described in poetry is the creation of mythological poetic imagery
 pracheen bhartiya parampara ke anusaar veda sabhi vidyaon kii utpatti ke mul hai
 With this view, an attempt has been made to explore the basic principles of poetry in the Veda
 saakshaat kavyashastra kaa vedon se koi sambandh nahin he
 In the Vedagnas, education, kalpa, grammar, nirukta, chhanda, astrology are the counts of these six disciplines, but not of poetry, but the Veda has been called the immortal poetry of God
 devsy pashy kavyan na mumaar na jiryati
 The word poet has been used in many places in the Vedas
 isliye veda swayan kavyarup he or usamen kavy kaa sampoorn soundarya paaya jaataa he
 The use of the word 'arankriti' is found in the seventh division of the Rigveda
 maharishi vasishtha indra se kehete hai - The elements, customs, ornamentation, sound, etc
, which have been discussed in the poetry of poetry, are found in the Vedas in practical or practical form
 da0 kane kaa mat he ki rigvaidic kaviyon ne upama, atishyokti, roopak aadi alankaaron kaa keval prayog nahin kiya varan kavyashastra ke siddhanton kaa bhi unhen kuch gyaan tha
 The use of Upma made by the sage Mantradashta in the presented mantra is also praiseworthy - isi prakaar ‘ushaa hasnev nirnite apsah’ main utpreksha kaa sundar prayog he
 Similarly, this mantra is also a beautiful example like- prastut mantra main pipal par rahane vaale do pakshiyon kaa varnan he jinamein ek to pipal ke mithe fal kha rahaa he doosraa bina fal bhakshan ke aanandamagn he
 Through these birds, the soul and the divine are depicted
 jeev indriya sukhon kaa bhoga karata he tathaa paramatma falon kaa bhoga na karata hua sansar main chaaron ore apane soundarya ko prakashit karata he
 Here is a beautiful example of emotion
 iske atirikt roopak, anupras, visheshokti kaa prayog suspasht he
 In other Samhita, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads, the independent existence of poetry is not found
 parvarti kaal main chah vedangon kaa vikaas hua unamem kavyashastra se sambaddh vishyon kaa newnaadhik pratipaadan drushtigat hota he
 In the Nirukta, Yask has mentioned the five distinctions of Upama - Bhootopama, Siddhopama, Karmopama, Lupopama
 saath hi apane purvavarti acharya garg ke upmanirupak lakshan ko uddhrut kiya he
 Acharya Yask has proved the significance of the experiments of Eve, Yatha, Na, Chitta, Nu and Aa while explaining ‘athapupamarthe Bhavit’
 nirukt main paribhaashik arth main alankaar shabd kaa prayog nahin miltaa kintu yask ne ‘‘alanrishnu’ shabd ko alankrita karne ke swabhaavvaala ke saamaanya arth main prayukt kiya he
 Upama's use of Upma is clearly available till the age of Panini
 yatha, vaa, ive kaa prayog tatra tasyev, ten tulyan kriya cheddati aadi sutron main vyakhyayit hua he
 'quadratic spelling: is the result of grammatology
 abhidha, lakshana shabdashaktiyon ko sarvapratham vaiyakarnon ne paribhaashit kiya
 Person power is also based on the theory of Sphotas
 uparyukt tathyon se spasht he ki vedag nirukt tathaa vyakaran main kavyashastra kaa sambandh he
 In this way, the seeds of the fundamental elements of poetry are found in sufficient quantity in the Vedas and Vedangas
 isvi san se shatabdiyon purv uttam prakaar kii kavy rachana hui iske paryaapt pramaan he
 Both Ramayana and Mahabharata epics provide the best kind of poetry
 mahabharat kavy kii apeksha dharamshastra he phir bhi yah anek kaviyon kaa upjivy rahaa he
 Ramayana is truly poetic in terms of its purpose, form, subject
 jahaan tak kavy rachana or kavy samiksha ke saamaanya siddhanton ke vikaas kaa prashn he valmikiy ramayana is drushti se mahatvapurn he
 It has the honor of being an Adi poet and its creator as an Adi poet
 udaatt style ke aise mahaan kaavyatmak prayaas ke saath kavy vivechan ke siddhanton ke nirmaan kaa prayaas swabhaavik he
 Some indications of this direction are available in the Ramayana
 ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke rup main kavyatv kaa samrudh rup saamne hone par kavyashastreey siddhanton kii sthapana kaa maarg badi spashtataa ke saath prashast hua hoga aisa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Although the independent work of Sanskrit poetry has not been done at this time, there is some evidence available on the basis of which it can be said that there was sufficient poetry in this period too
 mahakavy kaa swaroop nirupan ‘valmiki ramayana’ ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 The commentator of Rudrat Namisadhu mentions an epic called 'patalavijaya' by the name of Panini - Tatahi Paninee: Patalavijaye epic - "sandhyavadhungrihyakareen"
 jabaki rajasekhar unheen naam se jambavatijay kavy ko uddhrut karte he
 In the Suvrittatilaka, Kshendra has discussed Panini's distinction in the subcaste
 katyayan ke vaarthik main aakhyayika shabd ke prayog se spasht he ki aakhyayika naamak kavyang katyayan se purv prachlit ho chukaa tha
 In the Mahabhashya, there is mention of 'waruruochan Kavyam'
 saath hi vaasavadatta, sumanottara tathaa bhimarathi naamak aakhyayikaon kaa bhi ullekh he
 Patanjali has discussed two works on the stories of Kansavadh and Balibandhan and its dramatic performance
 in tathyon se yah suchit hota he ki patanjali se purv paryaapt maatra main kavy-aakhyayika tathaa naatakon kaa nirmaan hua tha
 The Natya Shastra of Bharata is the oldest book of poetry available in the present day
 kintu aise sakshya praapt hai jinke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki naatyashaastra bhartiya kavyashastra kaa aadi granth nahin he
 Thus, it is clear that there is no adequate classical representation before the original Natya Shastra, mentioning in sufficient quantity the fundamental elements of poetry
 natshastra ke pashchaat kavyavivechan sambandhit granthon ke pranayan kii parampara praapt hoti he or kavyashastreey dharanaon kaa vikaas uplabdh hota he
