 Ecosystems usually form numerous food webs that show the interdependence of these organisms and the flow of energy within the ecosystem
 paristhitiki tantra shabd ko 1930 main roy clafam dwaara ek paryaavaran ke sanyukt shaareerik or jaivik ghatakon ko nirupit karne ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 British ecologist Arthur Tansley later refined the term, describing it as "the whole system 


 not only the organism complex, but also the whole complex of all the physical factors that we call the environment"
 tansle paaritantron ko na keval prakritik ikaiyaan ke rup main, balki "maansik isolats" ke rup main bhi maanate the
 Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope"
 paristhitiki tantra avadharana kaa mukhya vichaar yah he ki jivit jeev apane sthaneey parivesh main har duusare tatv ko prabhavit karaten hai
 Eugene Odum, a founder of Ecology said: "an entity that includes all organisms that affect the physical environment is that a flow of energy within the system is a clearly defined nutritional structure, biotic variation and material cycle an ecosystem

 This is not a universal case and there is species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services at a sustainable level: moist tropical forests and extremely vulnerable to change, much less the production of goods and services There is no direct connection between proven, while many temperate forests within a lifetime or a forest fire to their previous state of immediate development Grow back after the tie

 The presence or absence of population depends only on reproduction and proliferation success and the population level fluctuates in response to stochastic events
 As the number of species in an ecosystem increases, the number of stimuli is also high

 While other local, sub-populations go continuously, later to be replaced through the spread of other sub-populations, the population will move in extinction because some species will disappear, given the great diversity among organisms on Earth
 Most ecosystems are only very Gradually, changed

 The sexes can be different according to different living species
 sambhog ko yoni maithun, kaam-krida, rati-krida bhi kehete hai
 The main job of sexual intercourse in the world from the beginning is to carry the lineage and produce children
 jahaan kai jaanavar va pakshi sirf apane bachche paidaa karne ke liye upyukt mausam main hi sambhog karte hai vahiin insaanon main sambhog is vajah ke bina bhi ho saktaa hai
 Sambhog is also a form of happiness or love or showing emotion in humans

 bhashavigyaan main 'akshar' yaa shabdaansh dhvaniyon kii sangathit ikai ko kehete hai
 Any word can be spoken by breaking it into fractions and syllables are the parts of the word that cannot be made any shorter, otherwise the sounds of the word are changed
 udhaahrantah 'achaanak' shabd ke teen shabdaansh hai - 'a', 'chaa' or 'nak'
 If 'a-cha-nak' is spoken intermittently, the three syllables of the word can be seen fragmentarily but the pronunciation of the word seems to be correct
 agar 'nak' ko aage todaa jaae to shabd kii dhvaniyaan galat ho jaatin hai - 'a-chaa-na-k'
 is shabd ko 'a-chaan-k' bhi nahin bolaa jaataa kyonki is se bhi uccharan galat ho jaataa he
 Some short words have the same syllable, such as 'in', 'ear', 'hand', 'walk' and 'ja'
 Some words have two syllables, such as 'walker', food, handkerchief and vegetable
 kuch main teen yaa us se bhi adhik shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'mahatvapurn' or 'antarrashtriya' 
 The word Akshar means - 'which cannot happen, nor can be destroyed'
 iskaa prayog pehle 'vaani' yaa 'vaak' ke liye evam shabdaansh ke liye hota tha
 The letter continued to be used for 'varna' as well
 yahi kaaran he ki lipi sanketon dwaara vyakt varnon ke liye bhi aaj 'akshar' shabd kaa prayog saamaanya jan karte hai
 Scientific study of the language has given the letter the meaning of English 'syllable', in which vowels, vowels and consonants, including vowels or consonant sounds with reminders, are considered
 ek hi aghat yaa bal main boli jane vaali dhwani yaa dhwani samudaay kii ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he
 The basis of unit separation is the vowel or vowel consonant
 vyanjan dhwani kisi uccharan main swar kaa purv yaa par ang banakar hi aati he
 Astu, the vowel in the letter is the spine
 akshar se swar ko na to pruthak hi kiya ja saktaa he or na bina swar yaa swararat vyanjan ke akshar kaa nirmaan hi sambhav he
 If the consonant is like a pearl in pronunciation, the vowel is like a thread
 yadi swar shashakt samraat he to vyanjan ashakt raja
 It is on this basis that a letter is often considered synonymous with vowels, but it is not so, yet vowels have great importance in letter formation
 katipay bhashaaon main vyanjan dhvaniyaan bhi akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 In English, consonant sounds like Na, Su and l are also pronounced vowrat and help in syllable formation like vowel sounds
 angreji silabal ke liye hindi main akshar shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has used the word 'swarik' for syllable
 
 Since the word alphabet has been used for many meanings in the history of language and grammar, its use in the meaning of syllable leads to the possibility of confusion
 shabd ke uccharan main jis dhwani par shikharata yaa ucchata hoti he vahi akshar yaa silabal hota he, jaise haath main aa dhwani par
 This word has a letter
 'akalpit' shabd main teen akshar hai - a, kal, pit ; aazaadee main teen - aa ja di; arthath shabd main jahaan jahaan swar ke uccharan kii pruthakta pai jaae vahaan-vahaan akshar kii pruthakta hoti he
 When considered from the point of view of sound production, the unit of pleural circulation is called syllable or vocal, which has the same sound
 sharir rachana kii drushti se akshar yaa swarik ko phuffus spandan bhi kah sakate hai, jiskaa uccharan dhwani tantra main avarodhan hota he
 When the component is highest in the movement letter at the time of pronunciation of the sound block or the lowest sound group, then that sound is alphabetic
 swar dhvaniyaan bahudhaa aksharvat uccharit hoti he evam vyanjan dhvaniyaan kvachit
 The absolutely separate unit of lexical pronunciation is called a letter, as kisi shabd main aksharon kii sankhya is baat par katai nirbhar nahin karti ki usamen kitni dhvaniyaan hai, balki is baat par ki shabd kaa uccharan kitne aghat yaa jatke main hota he arthath shabd main kitni avyavhit dhwani ikaiyaan hai
 In addition to the head sound used in the letter, the remaining sounds are called ‘aksharang’ or ‘gahvar sound’
 udhaaharan ke liye 'chaar' main ek akshar he jisamen aa sheersh dhwani tathaa c evam r gahvar dhvaniyaan hai
 In any syllable there is a 'syllabus center', which is always the vowel character and other characters are found around it which can be consonants and also vowels
 The syllable center of the syllable 'ear' is the vowel of 'aa', from which the letters 'a' and 'n' come later
