 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan sanyukt rajya america, britain or rus ne kandhe se kandha milakar dhuri rashtron- germany, italy or japan ke viruddh sangharsh kiya tha
 But as soon as the war ended, intense differences arose between Britain and the United States on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other
 bahut jald hi in matbhedon ne tanaav kii bhayankar sthiti utpann kar di
 Communist countries under the leadership of Russia and capitalist countries under the leadership of America were divided into two camps

 Berlin Crisis, Korea War, Molecular Testing by Soviet Russia, Military Organization, Indian China Problem, U-2 Plane Scandal, Cuban Missile Crisis were some of the circumstances which ignited the fire of Cold War
 san 1991 main soviet rus ke vighatan se uski shakti kam ho gayi or shityudh kii samaapti ho gayi
 As is clear from its name, it is not a war of arms and weapons but a war confined to threats
 is yuddh main koi vaastavik yuddh nahin ladaa gaya
 It was limited to indirect war only
 is yuddh main donon mahashaktiyon ne apane vaicharik matbhed hi pramukh rakhe
 It was a type of diplomatic war, which was based on the efforts of the narrow powers of the superpowers
 ke
pi
es
 minan ke anusaar - sheet yuddh do virdohi vichaardhaaraon - poonjeevaad or samrajyavad, do vyavasthaaon - burjua loktantr tathaa sarvhaara taanaashaahee, do guton - nato or varsa samjhauta, do rajyon - america or soviet sangh tathaa do netaaon - jon foster illaas tathaa stallin ke bich yuddh tha jiskaa prabhaav puure vishwa par padaa
 Thus it can be said that the Cold War was a speech war between two superpowers based on diplomatic measures
 yah donon mahashaktiyon ke madhya dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad utpann tanaav kii pratyaksh abhivyakti tha
 It was even more terrible than the actual war, being an ideological war
 shityudh ke lakshan dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hi prakat hone lage the
 Both the superpowers were fighting the war keeping in mind their narrow interests and showing the spirit of mutual cooperation
 jo sahyog kii bhaavana yuddh ke dauraan dikhaai de rahi thi, vah yuddh ke baad samaapt hone lagi thi or shityudh ke lakshan spasht taur par ubharne lag gaye the, donon guton main hi ek duusare kii shikaayat karne kii bhaavana balwati ho gai thi
 There were some strong grounds for these complaints
 ye parsparik matbhed hi shityudh ke pramukh kaaran the, shityudh kii utpatti ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai- The Cold War developed slowly
 iske lakshan 1917 main hi prakat hone lage the jo dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad spasht taur par ubharkar vishwa rangamanch par aae
 The spirit of mutual fear and mistrust between the two powers contributed to its promotion
 donon mahashaktiyon dwaara ek duusare ke viruddh chali gai chaalon ne is shityudh ko sabal aadhaar pradaan kiya or ant main donon mahashaktiyaan khulkar ek duusare kii aalochana karne lagi or samast vishwa main bhay va ashaanti kaa vaataavaran taiyaar kar diya, iske badhaava dene main donon mahashaktiyaan baraabar kii bhagidaar rahi
 Its development sequence can be understood in the following steps - is samay ke dauraan shityudh kaa asli rup ubhara
 The differences between the US and the Soviet Union came to light
 is kaal main sheet yuddh ko badhaane dene vaali pramukh ghatnaayen nimnlikhit hai- During this time, there was a possibility of some changes in the behavior of both the superpowers
 is yug main donon deshon ke netritv main parivartan hua

 soviet sangh kii taraf se donon deshon ke madhya madhur sambandh sthapit karne ke prayaas avashya hue lekin unka koi sakaaratmak parinaam nahin niklaa or america tathaa soviet sangh main sheet yuddh kaa tanaav jari rahaa
 During this time a few incidents occurred which gave impetus to the Cold War
 is prakaar is yug main sheet yuddh ko badhaava dene vaali kaarywahiyaan donon taraf se hui
 But both the superpowers also made some efforts towards reducing the tension of the Cold War
 khruschev ne donon deshon ke madhya sambandh madhur banane or tanaav kam karne ke liye 15 sitambar se 28 sitambar 1959 tak america kii yatra kii
 On 5 September 1963, there was a 'moscow Partial Trial Prohibition Treaty' between the US, Soviet Union and Britain
 isse sheet yuddh ko samaapt karne kaa sakaaratmak kadam kaha gaya
 The non-aligned Movement also tried to reduce the Cold War during this period, but the results of all these efforts remained negative and tension remained in both the superpowers
 1962 main cuba sankat ke baad sheet yuddh ke vaataavaran main kuch narmi ai or donon guton ke madhya vyaapt tanaav kii bhaavana sauhardpurn va mitrataa kii bhaavana main badalane ke asaar dikhaai dene lag gaye
 This started showing signs of the beginning of a sweet relationship between the two countries
 is narmi yaa tanaav main kami ko 'ditant' yaa 'tanavshithily' kii sangya di jaati he
 The tradition changed the landscape of the old international relations arising out of the Cold War and a peaceful atmosphere was born in the world
 isse sanyukt raashtra sangh kii bhoomika main bhi vruddhi hui or parmaanu yuddh ke aatank se chhutkaaraa mila
 The 1970s saw the transition to a new type of cold war as soon as the Afghanistan crisis was born
 is sankat ko 'ditant kii antim shavyatra' kaha jaataa he
 This brought an end to the tragedy, and the tension between the two powers that had lasted for almost a decade took days of diabolism and old tensions began to rise again
 isaki utpatti ke pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai All these reasons led to the birth of a new cold and the end of the tradition
 isse antarrashtriya sambandhon main nai khatas paidaa hui america ne khadi siddhanth ke dwaara vishwa shaanti ke liye khatra paidaa kar diya
 This new Cold War brought the world to the brink of World War III
 isse ditant kii haani hui or nishastreekaran ko gaharaa dhakka laga
 This made the centers of tension Afghanistan, Kampuchea, Nicaragua etc
 yah yuddh vichaardhaara virdohi na hokar soviet sangh virdohi tha
 Its agents were Britain, France and China, not just the US and Soviet Union
 is yuddh ne sampoorn vishwa kaa vaataavaran hi dooshit kar diya
 This gave rise to multipolarization and introduced new challenges in international relations
 shityudh ne 1946 se 1989 tak vibhinn charnon se guzarate hue alag-alag rup main vishwa raajnneeti ko prabhavit kiya
 This led to tensions between the US and the Soviet Union as well as other effects
 iske antarrashtriya sambandhon par nimnlikhit prabhaav pade- It can be said that the Cold War had a wide impact on international relations
 isane samast vishwa kaa do guton main vibhaajan karke vishwa main sangharsh kii pravriti ko badhaava diya
 It created a balance of terror in place of a balance of power
 lekin nakaaratmak prabhaavon ke saath-saath iske kuch sakaaratmak prabhaav bhi pade
 This paved the way for technical and technical development

 There is huge literature related to it in Sanskrit language
 kaamshaastra kaa adharapeeth he - maharishi vatsyayanrachit kamasutra
 Framed in the sutra style, Vatsyayana's most important book does not hold its own in the subject's comprehensiveness and style
 maharishi vatsyayan is shaastra main pratishthata hi maane ja sakate hai, udbhaavak nahin, kyonki unase bahut pehle is shaastra kaa udbhav ho chukaa tha
 We can divide the history of Kamasastra into three periods - pre-vatsyayan period, Vatsyana period and post-post-vatsyayana period
 kaha jaataa he, prajapati ne ek lakh adhyyon main ek vishaal granth kaa pranayan kar kaamshaastra kaa anrabh kiya, parantu kalantar main maanvon ke kalyaan ke liye iske sankshep prastut kiye gaye
 According to the mythological tradition, by the will of Mahadev, "nandi" composed a summary of it in one thousand chapters, to make it even more useful, Uddalaka Muni's son Shvetketu shortened it in five hundred chapters
 iske anantar paanchal babhavy ne tritiyansh main isaki or bhi sankshipt kiya—dedh sau adhyyon tathaa saat adhikranon main, kalantar main saat mahneey aacharyon ne prayek adhikaran ke upar saat swatantra granthon kaa nirmaan kiya— The fruit of this separate work proved harmful for the propagation of the scripture and gradually it began to get uneasy
 falat: vatsyayan ne in saaton adhikaran grarthon kaa saransh ekatra prastut kiya or is vishisht prayaas kaa parinat fal vatsyayan kamasutra hua
 Thus the emancipation of the literary centuries of the centuries of the present Kamasutra must be understood, although it is difficult to accept the expansion of this infinite practice of tradition-declared Kamasutra texts
 purvavatsyayan kaal ke aacharyon kii rachanaaon kaa vishesh pataa nahin chalata
 Vatsyayan has directed Brahmavraya's opinion with great respect in his book
 ghotkamukh or gonrdeey ke mat kaamshaastra or arthshaastra main ullikhit milte he
 Only the introduction of the existence of adopted and Kuchimar texts is well available to us
 acharya dattak kii vicitra jeevanakatha kamasutra kii jaimangla tikaa main he
 We are familiar with the subject of Kuchimar composed system even though it is not fully available
 is tantra main kamopayogi aushadhon kaa varnan he jiskaa sambandh brinhan, lepan, vashya aadi kriyaaon se he
 The handwriting of "kuchimarantantra" has been available from Madras, which the author gives the name of "upanishad" and due to which the tribunal propounded therein became known as "aupanishadic"
 vatsyayan kaa yah granth sutratmak he
 It is divided into seven tribunals, 36 chapters and 64 cases
 isamen chitrit bhartiya sabhyataa ke upar gupt yug kii gahari chhap he, us yug kaa shishtsabhy vyakti "naagarik" ke naam se yahan diya gaya he ki kamasutra bhartiya samajashaastra kaa ek maanya granthratna ban gaya he
 The purpose of the scripture is the nirvana of the folk journey, not the growth of the raga
 is taatpary kii siddhi ke liye vatsyayan ne ugr samadhi tathaa brahmacharya kaa paalan kar is granth kii rachana kii— The text is divided into seven tribunals
 pratham adhikaran main shaastra kaa samuddesh tathaa naagarik kii jeevanayatra kaa rochak varnan he
 The Second Tribunal provides a detailed account of the rhetoric
 puure granth main yah sarvaadhik mahatvashaalee khand he jiske das adhyyon main ratikreeda, aalingan, chumban aadi kamkriyaaon kaa vyapak or vistrut pratipaadan he
 In the third tribunal, the selection of the girl is the main subject, which also describes the meaning of the associated marriage
 chaturth adhikaran main bharya kaa kartavya, sapatni ke saath uskaa vyavhaar tathaa raajaaon ke ant:poor ke vishisht vyavhaar kramash: varnit hai
 The Fifth Tribunal gives a vivid description of subduing the perdara in which a comprehensive picture of the doi's work is available to us here
 shashth adhiktaran main veshyaaon, ke aacharan, kriyalap, dhanikon ko vash main karne ke hatkande aadi varnit hai
 The subject of the seventh authority is related to Vaidya Shastra
 yahan un aushadhon kaa varnan he jinka prayog or seven karne se sharir ke donon vastuon kii, shobhaa or shakti kii, vishesh abhivruddhi hoti he
 The Vaidyaka scripture of this remedy states "brihayoga"
 rachana kii drushti se kamasutra kautilya ke "arthshaastra" ke samaan he—chust, gambhir, alpakaay hone par bhi vipul arth se mandit
 Both have the same style - formulas; Even if there is a difference in the period of creation, the Arthashastra is of the Maurya period and the Kamasutra is of the Satavahana or Gupta period
 kamasutra ke upar chaar tikaayen praapt hoti hai- The following published critical commentaries on Kamasutra are - madhyayug ke lekhakon ne kaamshaastra ke vishay main anek granthon kaa pranayan kiya
 Their original shelter is the Grantharatna of Vatsyayana and new facts about Ratikrida have been specifically included
 aise granthkaaron main katipay kii rachanaayen khyatipraapt hai — Other published works in bahush: prakashit granthon ke atirikt kaamshaastra kii anek aprakashit rachanaayen uplabdh hai - The composition of these texts shows the prevalence and popularity of this scripture
 pratioxikaarak yaa pratiupachaayak ve yogic hai jinako alp maatra main duusare padaartho main mila dene se vayumdal ke oxigen ke saath unki abhikriya kaa nirodh ho jaataa he
 These compounds are also known as anti-oxidation and stabilizing and are also called stabilizers
 arthath prati-oxykaarak ve anu hai, jo anya anuon ko oxikaran se bachaate hai yaa anya anuon kii oxikaran prakriya ko dhimaa kar dete hai
 Oxidation is a type of chemical action by which electrons or hydrogen from a substance are transferred to an oxidizing agent
 pratioxykarakon kaa upyog chikitsavigyaan tathaa udyogon main hota he
 Antioxidants are added to petrol
 ye pratioxikaarak chipchipahat paidaa karne vaale padaarth nahin banane dete jo anterdahan ingine ke liye hanikaarak hai
 Often derivatives of substituted phenols and phenylenediamine are used for this work
 anek yogic hawa main khule rakhe jane par hawa ke oxigen dwaara swat: oxikrut ho jate hai
 As a result of this chemical action, some undesirable properties come in those substances, which make them unsuitable for general use
 is prakaar ke anek parivartanon kaa bodh saadhaaran indriyon dwaara ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the knowledge of the deterioration of substances by automatic oxidation and keeping them safe for more days was known to humans for a long time, although full knowledge of the process of 'automatic oxidation' could be obtained much later
 swat: oxikaran kii kriya chaar padon main sampann hoti he : The initial term that occurs at a very slow pace, kramash: teevr honevaali gati, Almost constant speed and antim hrasonmukhi gati
 The period leading up to the first term and the slow pace of the second term is called the inspiration period and it shows this
 yah baat shrunkhlaa abhikriya ke aadhaar par oxikaran abhikriya prakram kii pushti karti he
 In the automatic oxidation process, the actuators of the chain are free radicals which are very active
 swat: oxikrut honevaale anu main jo sabase nirbal carbon-hydrogen bandha hota he usee ke tuutane se ye mulak banate hai
 Therefore, the presence of a hydrogen atom easily emitted in this type of material is necessary
 iske atirikt usamen ek dwibandh bhi hona chahie jiske saath muktamulak sanyukt ho sake
 Although oxidation reactions are very important for life, they can also be harmful
 oxikaran abhikriya se muktamulak utpann ho sakate hai, jinke dwaara koshikaon ko kshati pahunchane vaali shrunkhlaa abhikriya aarambh ho jaati he
 Antioxidants themselves are oxidized to these free radicals, which helps to break the chain reaction
 kar koshikaon par hone vaali in shrunkhlaa abhikriyaaon ko roak dete hai
 Therefore, there are often antioxidant reducing agents, such as thiol, ascorbic acid or polyphenols, etc
 padpon evam jantuon main vividh prakaar ke pratioxykarakon ke nirmaan evam sangrah kii jatil vyavastha paayi jaati he
 These include glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E, enzymes etc
 pratioxykarakon kii aparyaapt maatra hone par yaa pratioxikaarak anzimon ke nasht hone se oxikar tanaav paidaa hota he jisase koshikaon ko kshati ho sakati he yaa unki mrityu ho sakati he
 It is believed that oxidative stress is the cause of many diseases
 isliye bheshajagunavigyaan main pratioxykarakon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya jaataa he visheshtah aghat tathaa tantrika-apbhrashti rogon ke liye yah bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Oxygen stress is the cause and result of diseases
 pratioxykarakon kaa poorak bhojan ke rup main khub prayog kiya jaataa he
 Antioxidants are most organic compounds, such as aromatic amine, phenol, amino phenol, etc
, which can be easily extracted from hydrogen atoms to transform into free radicals and propagate chain reactions
 pratioxikaarak apana kaary karte samay swat: nasht ho jate hai yaa swat: oxikrut honevaale padaarth inako kramash: nasht kar dete hai
 Some substances like rubber, gasoline and lubricating oils are automatically present in them but they get destroyed during their treatment
 at: is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki ve nasht na hon yaa shodhan ke baad phir unamem or pratioxikaarak milanaa padataa he
 Many aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, are auto-oxidized at a very rapid rate, so antioxidants such as hydroquinone, alphanaphthal, catechol, etc
 have to be used to prevent this
 kataar bharat main viksit evam prachinkaal se prachlit ek hathiyaar he
 Cone cells are a type of photogenic cells present in the eyes of the mammals
 aankhon main ek anya prakaar kii prakashagrahi koshika bhi hoti he jise shalaka koshika kehete hai
 The cones provide color vision and work in more light, while the spheres are able to see in low light and provide night vision but have very little color viewing capability
 ausat maanav aankh main lagbhag 70 karond shanku hote hai
 The cones are found more in the center of the eyes and play an important role in central vision while the vesicles are important in peripheral vision
 asthiyaan yaa haddiyaan rishadhari jeevon kaa vah kathor ang he jo antakkankaal kaa nirmaan karti hai
 It helps the body to run, support and protect the various organs of the body, as well as it works in the production of red and white blood cells and storage of mineral salts

 Simultaneously, two shops of the ashram were also given on rent

 At the time-2, pressure was also put on the tenant to vacate the shop by the people of the society, there was a fight with the tenant in this regard
 is ghatana ke baad samaaj main avishvaas kii bhaavana paidaa ho gai, tathaa ashram isi tarah se laavaaris padaa rahaa
 Again in the year 2005, some mischievous people of the society conspired to re-sell the vacant and unclaimed land of the ashram, but this time the society conscious exposed the conspiracy, building a trust to run the ashram
 did
 jiskaa naam “shri kabir ashram dharmarth trust samiti ” rakh diya gaya
 Simultaneously the trust was also registered with Tehsil Haridwar and Chitt Fund Society Dehradun
 trust ke adhyaksh ke rup main shri kailash chand ranimajaraa niyukt kiye gaye
 After this, on September 2007, the land of the ashram was registered in the name of the trust

 nijee antarrashtriya kanoon se taatpary un niyamon se he jo kisi rajya dwaara aise vaadon kaa nirnay karne ke liye chune jate hai jinamein koi videshi tatv hota he
 These rules are used in the decision of such subjects which have an effect on any fact, event or transaction which is related to any other domestic law system in such a way that it becomes necessary to monitor the system
 'nijee antarrashtriya kanoon' naam se aisa bodh hota he ki yah vishay antarrashtriya kanoon kii hi shakha he
 But in reality it is not so
 nijee antarrashtriya kanoon or saarvajanik antarrashtriya kanoon main kisi prakaar kii parsparikta nahin he
 The Roman Empire had all the circumstances that required international law
 parantu pustakon se is baat kaa puraa abhas nahin miltaa ki rome-vidhi-pranali main unka kis prakaar nirvaah hua
 After the fall of the Kingdom of Rome came the era of the law of law, which usually lasted until the end of the 10th century
 taduparant pruthak pradeshik vidhi pranali kaa janm hua
 In the 13th century, a lot of effort was made in Italy to make the necessary rules to give a definite outline to private international law
 16veen shatabdi ke francisi nyaayagyon ne sanvidhi siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya or prayek vidhi niyam main uskaa prayog kiya
 In the present era, private international law is divided into three major systems - nijee antarrashtriya kanoon is tatv par aadhaarit he ki sansar main alag-alag anek vidhi pranaliyaan hai jo jivan ke vibhinn vidhi sambandhon ko viniyamit karne vaale niyamon ke vishay main ek-duusare se adhikanshtah bhinn hai
 Although it is right that every ruler in his own country is sovereign and has exclusive jurisdiction over every person and object of the country, yet in the present era of civilization it is not possible to ignore the foreign laws
 Can go bahudhaa aise avasar aate hai jab ek kshetradhikaar ke nyaayalay ko duusare desh kii nyaay pranali kaa avlamban karnaa anivaary ho jaataa he, jisamen anyaay na hone paae tathaa nihit adhikaron kii raksha ho sake
 Foreign law and foreign elements - For the purpose of private international law, foreign law refers to the justice system of any geographical area beyond which the local law of that area cannot be used
 yah spasht he ki anyadeshiy kanoon kii upeksha se nyaay kaa uddeshy apurna rah jayega
 For example, when a dispute of the right obtained by law in one country is presented in the court of another country, it is absolutely necessary for the court to know what kind of right it is before the plaintiff is granted defense
 yah tabhi janaa ja saktaa he jab nyaayalay us desh kii nyaay pranali kaa pareekshan kare jiske antargat vah adhikaar praapt hua he
 Foreign elements appear in many forms in disputes
 kuch drushtaant is prakaar hai: When either of the various parties is of the other nation or its citizenship is foreign; jab koi vyavsaayee kisi ek desh main diwalia qaraar diya jaae or uske rindaata anyaay deshon main ho; When the suit is in relation to any property which is not situated in the territorial jurisdiction of that court and is situated in unjust countries
 nijee antarrashtriya kanoon prayek desh main alag-alag hota he
 For example, private international laws in France and England find opposition at many places
 isi prakaar angreji or amareeki niyam bahut kuch samaan hote hue bhi anek vishyon main ek-duusare se sarvatha bhinn hai
 In addition to the above, there is so much dissimilarity in the principles of various justice systems applicable in marriage-related questions that men and women who are considered married in one state are unmarried in another state
 is vishmata ko do prakaar se dur kiya ja saktaa he
 The first measure is to establish as much symmetry as possible in the legal systems of different countries; The second is the integration of private international law
 is disha main anek praytn hue parantu vishesh safalataa nahin mil saki
 In 1893, 1894, 1900 and 1904 AD, several conferences were held in the Hague city for this and rules regarding marriage, marriage, divorce, guardianship, prohibition, behavior etc
 were made by six different conventions
 isi prayojan-purti ke liye vibhinn rajyon main vyaktigat abhismay bhi sampadit hue
 The importance of the International Court of Justice is particularly important in the direction of integration of private international law
