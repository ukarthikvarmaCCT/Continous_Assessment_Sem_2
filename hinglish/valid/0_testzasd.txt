 The laws prevailing in various states were postponed and laws were made which were equally prevalent throughout the German Empire
 samaajwaadiyon se nipatane ke liye bismark ne 1878 main ek atyant kathor adhinium paas kiya jiske tahat samaajwaadiyon ko sabha karne par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Their key leaders were jailed
 samachar-patron or sahitya par kathor pabandi laga di gai
 Along with these repressive measures, Bismarck began to use "state-socialism" to distance the workers from socialists
 iske tahat usne mazdooron ko yah dikhaaya ki rajya swayan mazdooron kii bhalaai ke liy prayatnsheel he
 He implemented several insurance schemes, pension schemes for the benefit of his laborers
 striyon or baalkon ke kaam karne ke ghanton ko nishchit kiya gaya
 This 'state socialism' of Bismarck was not genuine socialism, as it was opposed to democracy and was supportive of capitalism
 audyogic unnati ke liye bismark ne german udyogon ko sangrakshan diya jisase udyogo or utpaadan main vruddhi hui
 New mandis were needed to sell finished goods
 is aavashyaktaa ne bismark kii aupniveshik niti apnaane ke liye perrit kiya
 As a result, in 1884 AD, Bismarck established several trading posts in the eastern and southern-western parts of Africa and broke out of the union of the three emperors
 usne kaha ki bismark ne ek mitra kaa paksh lekar duusare mitra ko kho diya he
 Austria's friendship with Bismarck was more beneficial because Germany had more influence in the event of a treaty between Austria, so in 1879 a duel was signed
 5 rus kaa germany se vilag ho janaa bismark ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya
 He felt that Russia should not enter into a friendship treaty with France
 atah usne turant hi rus ke saath sambandh sudhaarney kaa praytn kiya
 In 1881 he also got success
 ab germany, rus or austria ke bich sandhi ho gayi
 5 Now Bismarck turned his attention to Italy and made a treaty with Italy and wanted to completely separate France from European politics
 isi samay france or italy donon hi africa main sthit tunis par adhikaar karne ko icchhuk the
 Bismarck encouraged France to seize Tunis so that goodwill would spread in favor of Germany in France and France would become embroiled in imperialism, thereby removing talk of revenge from Germany
 1881 main france ne tunis par adhikaar kar liya jisase italy naaraaz hua
 Taking advantage of Italy's displeasure, Bismarck in 1882 executed a threesome treaty between Italy, Germany and Austria
 bismark ne nai 'sandhi pranali' ko janm diya
 He made various groups by making an alliance
 is sandhi pranali kii visheshta yah thi ki saamanyatya itihaas main jitani bhi sandhiyaan hui hai ve yudhkaal main hui thi
 But Bismarck gave rise to a new approach by giving rise to the treaty system in peacetime
 teen samraaton kaa sangh : videshniti ke kshetra main sandhi pranali ke tahat bismark kaa pehla kadam tha
 In 1872, a union of three emperors was formed, including Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, Tsar II of Russia and Emperor Willian i of Germany
 yadhyapi yah in teen deshon ke madhya koi likhit sandhi nahin thi, tathaapi kuch baton par sahmati hui thi
 They had agreed that in order to maintain peace in Europe and to deal with the socialist movement, they continued to cooperate and exchange ideas with each other
 yah sandhi bismark kii mahaan kootnithik vijay thi, kyonki ek taraf to usne cedova kii parajeet shakti austria ko mitra bana liya to duusari taraf france ke liye austria evam rus kii mitrataa kii sambhaavna ko samaapt kar diya
 But after some time this union broke up because the interests of Russia and Austria clashed in the Balkan region
 atah bismark ko rus or austria main se kisi ek ko chunanaa tha
 In the Treaty of Berlin of 1878, Bismarck had to choose between Russia and Austria, in which he favored Austria
 faltah rus usase naaraaz ho gaya
 To deal with religious issues and make the state paramount, Bismarck passed several laws against the Church
 1872 main jesuit samaaj kaa bahishkaar kar diya or prasha tathaa pope kaa sambandh-viched ho gaya
 According to the law passed in 1873, marriages started with the permission of the state courts, in which there was no need of the church
 shikshan sansthaaon par rajya kaa adhikaar ho gaya tathaa carch ko milane vaali sarkari sahaayta band kar di gai
 Despite these laws, Catholics did not bow down
 atah bismark ne samaajwaadiyon kii chunautiyon ko zyada khatarnaak samajhate hui catholicon ke saath samjhauta kiya
 Under this, laws against Catholics were repealed and established political relations with the Pope
 germany ke ekikaran ke pashchaat 1871 main bismark kii videsh niti kaa pramukh uddeshy europe main germany kii pradhanta ko banaae rakhana tha
 As a policy measure, it declared that Germany was a happy state and had no interest in territorial expansion
 bismark ko france se sarvaadhik bhay tha kyonki alses-lauren kaa kshetra usne france se praapt kiya tha, jisase france bahut asantusht tha
 Bismarck was confident that the French would not forget their 1870–71 defeat and the alsace-laurent region
 atah uski videsh niti kaa mukhya uddeshy france ko europe main mitraviheen rakhana tha taaki vah germany se yuddh karne kii sthiti main na aa sake
 In this way, the fundamental principles of Bismarck's foreign policy were - using practical opportunistic diplomacy to isolate the anti-german powers and make France devoid of allies, oppose liberalism and believe in militarism
 uski sandhi pranali ne pratisndhiyon ko janm diya
 As a result, a tense atmosphere was created in Europe and thus Europe reached the brink of World War I
 bismark kii videshniti ne europe main sanyeekaran evam shastreekaran ko badhaava diya
 This policy brought Europe to the threshold of the First World War
 bismark ne sabhi sandhiyaan paraspar virdohi rashtron ke saath kii thi
 Maintaining coordination between them was a very difficult task, which only a diplomat like Bismarck could do
 atah 1890 main pad tyaag karne ke pashchaat yah paddati ghaatak ho gai or germany ke viruddh france, rus aadi guton kaa nirmaan hua
 In this way, Bismarck's foreign policy in turn created the background of the First World War
 bismark kii gutbandi kii niti ke kaaran germany ke viruddh doosraa gut bana or ant main sampurna europe do sashastr evam shaktishaalee guton main vibhajit ho gaya
 The culmination of which appeared in the First World War
 1887 main bismark ne rus ke saath punaraashwaasan sandhi kii jiske tahat donon ne ek-duusare ko sahaayta dene kaa vachan diya
 This treaty was kept secret
 yah bismark kii kootnithik vijay thi kyonki ek hi saath germany ko rus or austria kii mitrataa praapt hui
 Bismarck tried to forge friendly relations with Britain
 bismark kaa maananaa tha ki britain ek nausainik shakti he or jab tak uski nausena ko chunauti nahin di jaaegi, tab tak vah kisi raashtra kaa virdohi nahin hoga
 Therefore, to please Britain, Bismarck did not take any step to increase the German Navy
 britain kii khush karne ke liye usne ghoshnaa kii ki germany samrajyavaadee desh nahin he
 England, on the other hand, had a colonial rivalry with France, taking advantage of which Bismarck developed good relations with Britain

 prayek vastu kii sthiti swabhaavat shunya he atah vah asat he atah isi rup m yahan bhram siddhant asadkhyatvaad kehalaata he == Criticism == 1 According to the Naiyayikas, secondary inference cannot be considered, Assad has only two meanings, 1 which does not exist anywhere, 2 Knowledge of an object which is absent in the presented context, but is extant elsewhere if If the first option is considered then it is not possible, because the discrete experience cannot be created, again on assuming the second option, a situation of opposite realism will emerge
 So then where is the power of illusion because the subject of illusion is discrete and the subject of real knowledge is also discrete, in this case the origin of prama will not be explained

 In the early period of Murad IV, his family handled all the political activities of the state
 khaaskar unki maan kausam sultan jo vaastavik taur par hukumat chalaati thi
 The empire was plunged into many troubles; The Safawi Empire invaded Iraq, rebelled in northern Anatolia, and in 1631 the Janissarians attacked the palace and killed Wazireazam

 In 1628, at the age of 16, his brother-in-law and former Egyptian subordinate Qara Mustafa Pasha was executed on his court because according to the sultan, Wazir's acts were "against the law of Allah"

 During the period of Murad IV, there was a war between the Osmanis and the Safavis
 osmanion ne azarbaijan, tabarez, hamadaan or 1638 main baghdad par qabza kar liya tha
 Subsequently, according to the agreement between the Osmanis and Safavis in the Zuhab, the territories of Amasia, East Armenia, East Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Dagestan were assigned to the Safavis, while the areas of Western Armenia and West Georgia were assigned to the Osmanis
 mesopotamia bhi osmanion ko saunpa gaya
 These boundaries were fixed as a result of the war, and today the existing borders between Turkey, Iraq and Iran are almost identical
 1638 main baghdad kii gheraabandi ke dauraan, shaharvasi ne lagbhag chalis dinon tak haar nahin maani
 But when the townspeople were forced to give up, the aggressors massacred the townspeople in large numbers, while promising that they would not do so
 kaha jaataa he ki muraad ne hukum diya ki ek hazaar qaidiyon ke siron ko ek hi samay main kalam kar diya janaa chahie
 It is said that Murad enjoyed a lot while serving this hookam

 While Murad IV was in Baghdad, he met two of the ambassadors of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, Mir Barka and Mir Zarif

 Murad IV gave importance to architecture and many monuments were built during his time
 1635 main nirmit baghdad kiyask or 1638 main nirmit revan kiyask donon sthaneey shaileyon ke mutabik nirmit hui
 Fungus inn pavilion; Plains Mosque; Bairam Darvesh Pasha Lodge, Mazar, Fountain, and Primary School; And Sharafuddin Mosque in Konya is counted among the monuments built during his time

 is shabd kaa istemaal aamtaur par insaanon ke liye kiya jaataa he, lekin saidhantik rup se, pashuon ke bartaav ke kaarnon kii vyakhya ke liye bhi iskaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The reference to this article is human motivation
 vibhinn siddhanton ke anusaar, buniyadi zaruuraton main shaareerik dukh-dard ko kam karne or sukh ko adhiktam banane ke mul main abhiprerana ho sakati he, yaa isamen bhojan or aaraam jaisi khaas zaruuraton ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he; yaa ek abhilashit vastu, shauk, lakshya, astitv kii dasha, adarsh, ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, yaa inase bhi kamatar kaarnon jaise paropkaarita, naitikta, yaa mratyu sankhya se bachane ko bhi isamen aropit kiya ja saktaa he
 Intrinsic motivation itself comes from the reward inherent in a task or activity — to enjoy a puzzle or an attachment to a game
 1970 ke dashak se prerana ke is swaroop kaa adhyayan saamaajik or shaikshanik manovaigyanikon dwaara kiya ja rahaa he
 Research has found that it is usually associated with higher academic achievement and enjoyment of students
 fritz heidar ke gunaropan siddhant, bandura ke aatm-bal par kiye gaye kaaryon or rayaan or rayaan or deki ke sangyanatmak moolyankan siddhant ke jariye aantarik prerana kii vyakhya kii gayi
 Students can be internally motivated if they: antrik abhiprerana jaise: bhukh, pyaas, mal, mutr, camecha, krodh, prem, udasi adibahye abhiprerana jaise: pariksha parinam, puruskaar, dand, pratiyogita, prashansa, ninda aadi
 External motivation comes from outside the seeker
 rupaya-paisa sabase spasht udhaaharan he, lekin dabaav or sajaa kaa khatra bhi aam bahya prerana hai
 In the game, the crowd cheers on the player's performance, which may motivate him to perform better
 traphiyaan bhi bahari protsaahan hai
 The competition is also a common extrinsic motivation, as it encourages the performer to win and defeat others, not to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity
 saamaajik manovaigyanik shodh bataata he ki bahya puraskaar ati auchityata or saath hi aantarik prerana main kami kii ore le ja saktaa he
 External incentives can sometimes weaken motivation
 green or leppar dwaara kiye gaye ek clasik adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki jin bacchon ko unki chitrakaari ke liye muktahast ho kar felt-tip kalmon se puraskrit kiya gaya tha, baad main unhone kalmon ke saath phir se khilne yaa kalmon ko chitrakaari ke liye istemaal main kam ruchi dikhaai
 The number of people who perceive self-restraint of motivation as a subgroup of emotional intelligence is increasing; by balanced definition a person may be very intelligent, yet he is not motivated to dedicate this intelligence to certain tasks
 Can also happen
 yel skool of management ke professor victor vroom kaa "pratyaasha siddhant" iskaa lekha pesh karata he ki vyakti hi tay karenga ki ek vishesh lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye vah apane aatmasanyam ko kab lagu kare
 Motivation and desires can be interpreted as a lack or need, which drives one to achieve a goal or encouragement
 These thoughts originate within the individual and may not require any external catalyst to encourage behavior
 buniyadi prerakashkti kinhin kamiyon; masalan- bhukh jo ek vyakti ko bhojan kii talash ke liye prerit karata he, se kaundhti he, jabaki adhik sookshm prerakashkti prashansa or anumodan praapt karne kii ichha, jo ek vyakti ko is tarah se aacharan karne ke liye prerit kar sakati he, jisase duusare khush hon
 In contrast, the role and stimulus of external rewards is also seen in animals
 pashuon ko prashikshan dene ke dauraan jab ve sahi dhang se kisi chaal ko sahi dhang se samajhakar us kaary ko sampann karte hai to unhen acchhee tarah khilaa-pilaakar unki aavbhagat main isaki misaal dekhi ja sakati he
 Feeding animals with good food serves as a catalyst for their consistently good performance; Even when good food is not given later, their performance remains the same
 koi inaam, thos yaa amoort, ek kriya ke baad is iraade se diya jaataa he, taaki vah vyavhaar dubaara ghatit ho
 This is done by adding positive meaning to the behavior
 adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki agar vyakti ko inaam turant miltaa he, to prabhaav bahut adhik hota he or deree hote jane se prabhaav kam hota jaataa he
 Repeating a combination of verb-rewards can make that verb habit
 prerana do sroton se aati he: apane adanr se or anya logon se
 in donon sroton ko kramshah aantarik abhiprerana or bahya abhiprerana kaha jaataa he
 Applying proper motivational techniques is more difficult than it sounds
 steven kerr ne yah paaya ki jab ek inaam pranali banaayi jaati he, yah aasaan ho saktaa he ki a ko puraskrit kiya jaay, jabaki b se aashaa lagaayi ja rahi he or is prakriya main hanikaarak prabhaav padate hai jo aapke lakshyon ko jokhim main daal sakate he
 a consolidator is different from a reward, the sum of certain things in the environment is intended to produce a measured increase in the rate of desired behavior in this consolidation or reinforcement
 kai tarah ke sahaj prerana siddhant hote hai
 Instinctive motivation-reduction theory has evolved from the concept that we have certain biological innate motivation, such as hunger
 If it is not satisfied, spontaneous sedation increases with the passage of time
 prerakashkti santusht ho jaati he to uski takat kam ho jaati he
 This theory is based on a diverse range of ideas from feedback control systems such as Freud's theories of thermodynamics
 prerakashkti ke kuch sahaj gyaan yukt yaa lok vaidhata siddhant hai
 For example, when the food is being cooked, there is also a spontaneous paradigm paradigm in the rhythm of increasing appetite until the meal is ready, and there is a decrease in the occult appetite after eating the food
 kai tarah kii samasyaayein hai, tathaapi, jo sahaj prerana katautee kii vaidhata ko khuli bahes ke liye chhod detii hai
 The first problem is that it does not explain how secondary integrators reduce spontaneous motivation
 udhaaharan ke liye paison se jaivik yaa manovaigyanik jarurat puri nahin hoti, lekin tankhwaah duusare kram kii sthiti ke jariye prerakashkti ko kam kar detii he
 Secondly, an innate motivation, such as hunger, is seen as a "desire" to eat food, which makes instinctive motivation a homocular disposition - a trait that is criticized as the basic problem of the 'little man' and his desires
 It is easily said to be heart-warming
 iske alaava yah saafe he ki sahaj prerana katautee siddhant puri tarah se aacharan kaa siddhant nahin ho saktaa, yaa ek bhookha insaan khaanaa pakaana puraa karne se pehle khaae bagaiyr bhojan pakaa nahin saktaa
 sabhi prakaar ke vyavhaar se nipatane main sahaj prerana siddhant kii sakshmata, sahaj prerana ko satusht nahin karne se, yaa "swaadisht" bhojan ke liye atirikt prerakashkti lagaakar, jo "bhojan" ke liye sahaj prerakashktiyon se milakar khaanaa pakaane or swaad ke bare bataati he
 Leon Festinger has suggested that this happens when a person experiences some discomfort due to incompatibility between the two cognitions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek upabhokta apni ek kharid ke liye khud ko aashwasit karata he, lekin saath hi vah punarawalokan karte hue sochataa he ki doosraa faisla behatar ho saktaa he
 When there is a conflict between a belief and a behavior, then another example of cognitive perception is found
 ek vyakti swasth rahanaa chahta he, uskaa maananaa he ki dhumrapaan swasthya ke liye hanikaarak he, phir bhi vah dhumrapaan jari rakhata he
 One of the most widely discussed theories of inspiration is Abraham Maslov's theory
 siddhant kaa saransh is tarah prakat kiya ja saktaa he: The list of needs from basic to most complex is as follows: fredrick harmberg kaa doharaa kaarak siddhant, urf aantarik / bahya prerana ke siddhant, kaa nishkarsh he ki kaarysthal main kuch tatwon se kaam main santushti milti he, lekin agar ye anupasthit ho to asantosh paidaa hota he
 Factors that motivate people to change their lives forever, but the feeling of 'I respect you as a person' is a very motivating factor at any stage of life
 unhone isamen is tarah fark kiya: The health factor is named because where you are clean, it is not necessary that you become more healthy, but if it is not there, your health may decline
 is siddhant ko kabhi-kabhi "abhiprerak-swatchta siddhant" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The use of Herzberg theory is found in business fields such as information systems and studies related to user satisfaction

 The theory of self-determination developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan highlights the importance of intrinsic motivation as an impetus to human behavior
 maslove or is aadhaar par nirmit anya ke padanukramik siddhant kii tarah SDT vruddhi or vikaas kii swaabhaavik pravriti ko manyata detaa he
 Although like other such principles, SDT does not involve "self-driving" for any kind of achievement, but instead calls for active encouragement from the environment
 praathmik kaarak, jo prerana or vikaas ko protsaahit karte hai; ve swaittata, yogyata kii saraahna or sambhddhata hai
 The latest proposal in terms of achievement motivation is unified vision, as propounded by Heinz Schooler, George C
 Thornton III, Andreas Frintrup and Rose muller-hanson in the "onion-ring Model of Achievement Motivation"
 is vichaar kaa aadhaar yah he ki pradarshan abhiprerana ke kaaran vyaktitv kaa mukhya ghatak pradarshan kii ore rukh kar letaa he
 Consequently, it includes a sequence of dimensions that are relevant to success in the work, but which are not traditionally considered part of the performance motivation
 In particular, it integrates previously isolated perspectives with social objectives such as domination to require achievement
 uplabdhi prerana suchi isi siddhant par aadhaarit hai or vyavsaayik va peshewar safalataa ke akalan ke liye teen kaarak praasangik hai
 Goal theory is based on the assumption that sometimes people have an impetus to reach a clearly defined end
 aksar, yah ant apane aapmen ek puraskaar hota he
 a goal's efficiency is influenced by these three characteristics: proximity, difficulty, and specificity
 An ideal goal should create a situation where the time between enforcement and end of behavior is close
 yah hamen bataata he ki kuch bachche bijganit main maahir hone ke bajaay motor cycle chalaanaa seekhney ke liye kyon adhik prerit hua karte hai
 a goal should be measurable, which should not be too difficult or too easy to accomplish
 In both cases, most people are not motivated as well as those who like the challenge
 Also, people want to feel that there is a lot of possibility that they will be successful
 Uniqueness is interested in describing the goal in your classroom
 vyakti vishesh ke liye lakshya nishpaksh rup se paribhaashit or suspasht hona chahie
 Trying to get the maximum grade possible is a great example of a poorly specified goal
 adhikansh bacchon ko pataa hi nahin hota ki us lakshya tak pahunchane ke liye unhen kitna prayaas karne kii jarurat he
 Douglas Vermeiren has done extensive research on why many people fail to achieve their goals
 asafalataa ke liye sidhe-sidhe prerit karkon ko jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he
 Vermeiren states that unless a person clearly identifies his motivating factor or his important and meaningful reasons, why would he want to achieve the goal, he will never have the power to achieve it
 vyavhaar parivartan ke saamaajik-sangyanatmak model main prerana or ichhashakti kaa nirmaan shaamil he
 Motivation is seen as a process that leads to the creation of behavioral intentions
 ichhashakti ko ek aisi prakriya ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo iraade ko vaastavik vyavhaar kii ore le jane kaa kaam karti he
 In other words, motivation and will are seen in terms of setting and achieving goals respectively
 donon prakriyaaon main aatm-niamak prayaason kii aavashyaktaa he
 Many self-regulatory creations need to work in Vrindavadana to achieve the goal
 aatm-gun yaa aatm-bal ko samajhnaa abhiprerak or ichhashakti rachana kaa ek udhaaharan he
 Self-confidence is facilitated by the development of behavioral intentions, the development of action plans and the will of action
 yah iraade ko karrwai main badalane main madad kar saktaa hai
 Some psychologists believe that an important part of human behavior is energized and guided by subliminal motivation
 maslove ke anusaar, "manovishleshan ne aksar hi dikhaaya he ki ek sachet ichha or param achetan lakshya ke bich rishte kaa aadhaar pratyaksh hone kii jarurat nahin
" duusare shabdon main, bataayi gayi abhiprerana hameshaa kushal paryvekshakon dwaara lagaaye gaye anumaan se mail nahin khaati
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah sambhav he ki ek vyakti durghatana-pravan ho, kyonki usamen khud ko chot pahunchane kii achetan ichha he or isliye nahin ki vah laaparvaah yaa suraksha-niyamon se anjaan he
 Similarly, some overweight people are not hungry for food at all, but are restless to fight and kiss
 bhojan karnaa dhyaan kii kami kaa mahaj ek rakshaatmak pratikriya he
 Some workers do more damage to equipment than others, because of their subconscious feelings of anger against management
 manochikitsakon kaa kahana he ki kuch vyavhaar itane swachaalit hote hai ki vyakti ke chetan man main iske kaaran uplabdh nahin ho pate
 badhyakaari cigarette dhumrapaan iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 Sometimes it is so important to maintain self-esteem and the motivation for an activity is so frightening that it cannot be understood, in fact, that is disguised or suppressed
 yuktisangat, yaa "vyakhya se pare", aise chhadmavesh yaa raksha pranali he, ke naam se yah janaa jaataa he
 Another example is to blame our own mistakes on others
 "mujhe lagata he ki mujhe dosha diya jaay", darasal "yah uski galati he, vah swaarthee he" main badal jaataa he
 The suppression of powerful but socially unacceptable seductiveness can turn into ostentatious behavior, contrary to repressed tendencies
 udhaahranswarup, ek karmchaaree jo apane bos se nafrat karata he, lekin vah kuch zyada hi kaam kiya karata he taaki aisa lage ki bos ke prati uske man main bada adarbhav he
 Subliminal motivations impede the interpretation of human behavior and the extent to which they exist makes the administrator's life as difficult
 duusari ore, achetan prerakashktiyon ke astitv kii jaankaree se vyavhaar kii samasyaon kaa or adhik chaukas akalan kiya ja saktaa he
 Although some contemporary psychologists deny the existence of subliminal factors, many believe that they are only active in times of anxiety and stress and, from the point of view of human behavior in normal life events - are rationally objective
 
 6,000 se adhik logon par kiye gaye adhyayan kii shuruyaat se professor steven reis ne ek siddhant prastaavit kiya, jisamen 16 buniyadi ichchhaaon kii baat kahi gayi he jo lagbhag sabhi insaani vyavhaar main paaya jaataa he
 These wishes are as follows: is model main, in buniyadi ichchhaaon par logon main matbhed he
 These basic desires represent intrinsic motivation that directly motivates a person's behavior and are not intended to satisfy other desires indirectly
 log gaiyr-buniyadi ichchhaaon se bhi prerit ho sakate hai, lekin is maamle main gabhir prerana se yah sambandhit nahin he, yaa keval anya buniyadi ichchhaaon ko praapt karne ke saadhan ke taur par akelaa saadhan nahin he
 Control over motivation is understood to a limited extent only

 In order to know how to control motivation, it is necessary to first understand why many people lack motivation

 In addition to absolutely straightforward approaches to motivation, in early life, there are solutions that are more absolute, but perhaps not more practical, for self-motivation
 vastutah har abhiprerana paridarshika main kam se kam ek adhyay vyakti ke kaaryon or lakshyon kii samuchit vyavastha ke bare main hota he
 It is generally suggested that it is necessary to list tasks by distinguishing between tasks that have been completed and those that have not been completed, so some of the necessary motivation to create that in that "meta-task" Should be moved, in the task list which is described as the progress of the task, which can become a routine
 puure kiye gaye kaaryon kii suchi dekhnaa bhi prerak kaa kaam kar saktaa he, kyonki yah uplabdhi ke liye ek santoshjanak bhaavana paidaa kar sakati he
 This is the basic functionality in most electronic works lists, although the difference between completed and incomplete tasks is not always clear

1 ASP
NET is a web application framework developed and marketed by Microsoft to allow programmers to create dynamic web sites, web applications and web services
 
NET fremawork ke sanskaran 1
0 ke saath ise pehali baar janvari 2002 main jari kiya gaya tha evam yah microsoft kii active sarwar pejiz praudyogiki kaa uttaradhikari he
 ASP
NET is built at the common language runtime allowing programmers to write ASP
NET code using any supporting 
NET language
 ASP
NET SOAP ekstansion fremawork ASP
NET component ko SOAP sandeshon ko prakriyaarat karne kii suvidha pradaan karata he
 After the release of Internet Information Services 4
0 in 1997, Microsoft began research on the possibilities for a new web application model that could address common complaints regarding ASP, particularly with regard to submission and content launch
 Be able to write "clean" code
 mark anders, prabandhak IIS team evam duk vishvavidhyalay se snaatak scot guthrie, jinhone 1997 main microsoft main kaarybhaar grahan kiya, ko is model ke nirdhaaran kii jimmedaari saunpi gai
 The initial design was developed by Anders and Guthrie within two months and Guthrie coded the initial prototype during the Christmas holiday in 1997
 praarambhik prototip ko "XSP" kaha gaya
 In a 2007 interview, Guthrie stated that "people will always ask what 'X' means
" us samay iskaa vastav main koi matlab nahin tha
 XML starts with; XSLT started with that
 prayek acchhee chiz x se prarambh hoti hui prathit hui isiliye hamane spashtatah iskaa yah naam rakhaa
" XSP kaa praarambhik prototip java kaa prayog karte huye banaaya gaya tha, lekin jald hi kaaman laguage rantime ke sheersh par nae platform kaa nirmaan tay kiya gaya kyonki isane object oriented progaming vaataavaran, kachra ekathran evam anya visheshtaon kii suvidha pradaan kii, jo ki vaanchhneeya visheshtayen maani gayin jise microsoft kaa component object model plateform saport nahin karata
 guthrie ne is nirnay ko ek "bada jokhim" qaraar diya kyonki unke naye web vikaas plateform kii safalataa CLR kii safalataa par nirbhar hogi jo ki XSP kii tarah vikaas kii aanrabhik avasthaa main he, yahan tak ki XSP team microsoft main pehali aisi team thi jisane CLR ko lakshya kiya tha
 With the speed of the Common Language Runtime, XSP was re-implemented in c # and renamed ASP + as the new platform was seen as the successor to Active Server Pages up to this point and providing easier migration routes for ASP developers
 Was intended to phinics, arizona main 02 may 2000 ko yojit ASP conection sammelan main mark anders ne pehali baar ASP+ kaa pradarshan kiya
 Demonstrations to the wider public and the initial beta release of ASP + were made on July 11, 2000 at the 2000 Professional Dabblers Conference in Orlando, Florida
 bill gates kii mukhya prastuti ke dauraan, phujitsu ne ASP+ ko COBOL ke ek sanyugma ke rup main prayog kaa pradarshan kiya evam microsoft ke naye vijual basic 
NET evam c # laguage kai anya laguage ke saath iske saport kii udghoshnaa kii gayi, iske alaava active state dwaara srujit interoparability tuls ke rup main paythan evam parl saport kii udghoshnaa kii gayi
 Once the "
NET" brand was decided in the late 2000s, it was decided to rename ASP + to ASP
NET
 us varsh da MSDN sho main mark anders ne yah bataaya ki "
NET prayaas kai karkon ke bare main he, yah software ko ek seva ke rup main pradaan karne ke bare main he, yah XML evam web sevaaon ke bare main he evam yah internet main isaki kshamta anusaar vruddhi karne ke bare main he
 

 We want to name it with other platform components that make up the 
NET Framework
 " After four years of development and a series of beta releases in 2000 and 2001, ASP
NET 1
0 was released on 05 January 2002 as a part of version 1
0 of the 
NET Framework
 release hone ke pehle hi, ASP
NET ke bare main darjanon kitaaben likhi gayin evam microsoft ne ise bade paimaane par web sevaaon hetu apane plateform ke rup main protsaahit kiya
 Guthrie became the Product Unit Manager for ASP
NET and development continued and on April 24, 2003, version 1
1 was released as a part of Windows Server 2003
 is release main mobile upkarnon hetu ASP
NET ke saport main sudhaar par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya
 
NET pages, duly known as "web forms", are the main building blocks for application development
 filon main web forms "
aspx " ekstansion ke saath upasthit rahete hai; ye filein vishesh rup se sthitij HTML markup ke saath sarwar said web control evam prayokta control ko paribhaashit karne vaale markup rakhti hai jisamen deblopers web pej hetu samast aavashyak sthitij evam gatij saamagree rakhte hai
 Additionally, dynamic code, which runs on the server, can be placed in a page within a block that is similar to other web development technologies such as PHP, JSP, and ASP, but in addition to the purpose of data binding this approach This is generally discouraged because it requires more calls when performing a page
 dhyaan den ki yah namoona code-bihaind ke virodh main code "inline" kaa upyog karata he
 Microsoft recommends working with dynamic program code using the Behind model that puts this code in a separate file or specifically defined script tag
 code bihaind filon kaa naam vishesh rup se mypage
aspx
cs yaa mypage
aspx
vb jaisaa hota he jabaki pej file mypage
aspx hoti he jaisaa hi file naam lekin pej language ko darshaate huye antim ekstansion ke saath)
 yah tarika microsoft vijual studio evam anya ides main swachaalit he
 Using this method of programming, the déballer writes code to answer various events such as 'page loading' or 'a control is being clicked' in place of a procedural study of the document
 ASP
NET kaa code-bihaind model paramparaagat ASP se alag he jisamen yah deblpar ko prastuti tathaa saamagree ke pruthakkaran ko dhyaan main rakhte hue anuprayogon ke nirmaan ke liye protsaahit karata he
 In theory, this would allow a web designer to focus less on design markup, for example, to interfere with the programming code running it
 yah model vyuu-controlar fremawork main drishy se controlar ke pruthakkaran ke samaan he
 & lt; / source & gt; uparokt tag ASPX file ke prarambh main rakhaa gaya he
 The code file properties of the @ page refer to the specification files that act as code behinds while the underlying properties specify the range from which the page is derived
 is udhaaharan main @ pej vinirdesh samplecodebehind
aspx main shaamil he, tab samplecodebehind
aspx
cs is pej hetu code-bihaind ke rup main kaary karata he
 In this case, the page_load method is invoked each time the ASPX page is requested
 progaamar processing karne ke liye pej akjicution process ke vibhinn charnon main event handlers ko karyanvit kar saktaa he
 An event bubbling mechanism provides the ability to pass events run by the user control to its containing page
 progaamar ASP
NET anuprayogon hetu custom control kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakate hai
 Unlike user controls, these controls do not have an ASPX markup file collecting all their code in a dll-file
 Such custom controls can be used in various web applications and Visual Studio projects, using the register specification, control is loaded from the DLL
 ASP
NET, vijited composit prastutikaran takanic kaa upyog karata he
 During archiving, the template file is stored in enforcement code that creates a control tree representing the original template
 paathya shabdic niyantran varg ke udaahranon main chalaa jaataa he, tathaa sarwar niyantran vishisht niyantran varg ke udaahranon dwaara prastut kiye jate hai
 The enforcement code is combined with the code written by the user and results in a particular category for the page
 control tree ke mul ke anusaar pej doguna hota he
 The actual request for the page is processed through several steps
 sabase pehle, pravartan charnon ke dauraan, pej ke varg kaa udhaaharan banaaya jaataa he tathaa pravartan code ko karyanvit kiya jaataa he
 This creates the initial control tree, which is now typically handled by page methods in later stages
 chunki tree main prayek node, varg ke udhaaharan ke rup main prastut ek control hota he, jo code tree kii sanrachana ko badal sakane ke saath-saath ekal node ke gun-dharm / vidhiyon main bhi her-pher kar saktaa he
 Finally, during the presentation phase, a visitor is used to view each node in the tree, instructing each node to present itself using visitor methods
 parinamswaroop HTML output graahak ko bhej diya jaataa he
 After processing the request, the page range instance and the full control tree are separated
 yah saamanytah nausikhia ASP
NET programmeron ke liye sanshay kaa strot hota he jo ki shrenee udhaaharan sadasyon par nirbhar hote hai jo prayek prishth anurodh / pratikriya chakra ke saath kho jate hai
 ASP
NET applications are hosted on web servers and viewed on state-less HTTP protocols
 isaliye, yadi aplicoshan state-phul arntakriya kaa prayog karata he, to ise swany hi state prabandhan ko karyanvit karnaa hoga
 ASP
NET provides various functions for state management in ASP
NET applications
 siddhanthata, microsoft "state" ko adhiktar GUI state maanata he, badi samasya us samay paidaa hogi jab koi aplicoshan finit state mashin jaise "data treks" par najar rakhane kii aavashyaktaa samajhataa he jo ki anurodh ke dauraan alpakaalik state he athwa ise prarambh karne main vakt lagata he
 The application state is a collection of user-defined variations shared by an ASP
NET application
 jis samay aplicoshan ke pratham avasar par loding ke samay Application_onstart kii ghatana fire hoti he, us samay yah sat tathaa inishilyse hoti hai tathaa antim drushtaant rahane tak uplabdh hoti he
 Application state variations can be viewed using the application repository, which provides a cover for application state variations
 aplicoshan state vibhinnataaon ko naam se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The session state is user-defined session variations that exist during the user session
 yah vibhinnataaain upabhokta seshan ke vibhinn avasaron ke liye vishisht hoti he, tathaa seshan Session sangrah kaa prayog karte hue dekhi ja sakati hai
 Session variations can be set to be destroyed by themselves after a set time of inactivity, although the session has not ended
 graahak sire par, prayokta seshan ko yaa to kukies se athwa URL main hi seshan aay di kii ankoding ke dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he
 ASP
NET supports three modes of persistence for session variations
 vyuu state se taatpary pej-str ke state prabandhan tantra se he, jiskaa prayog webform controls evam vidjats kii avasthaa ko banaaye rakhane ke liye ASP
NET anuprayogon dwaara utsarjit HTML pejon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The status of the controls is coded and sent to the server on each form presentation in an invisible field known as _viewstate
 sarwar, vairiebil ko waapas bhejtaa he taaki jab bhi pej ko punah prastut karte hai, control unki antim avasthaa par prastut hote hai
 On the server side, the application may change the viewstate if processing results in an update to the control state
 sarwar par swatantra yaa akele controlon kii avasthaa ko dicoded kiya jaataa he evam vustate collection kaa prayog karte huye ASP
NET pejon par prayog hetu uplabdh hai
 The main objective for this is the preservation of form information beyond postbacks
 atah jab ek prayokta form ko bharta he evam koi galat mulya pravisht kar detaa he to isamen sudhaar ke liye prayokta ko waapas karte samay form swatah bhar jaataa he
 The viewstate is turned on without any errors, and after every control on the page, it normally categorizes the data, regardless of whether it was actually used during postback
 iske vyavhaar main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he, haalaaki, vustate prati control, prati pej yaa sarwar-wide aadhaar par disabil kiya ja saktaa he
 deblappers need to be careful when storing sensitive or personal information in the viewstate of a page or control, because the base64 string containing the viewstate data can be easily graded by any one tool available on the web or by any generic base64 decoder 
 bina kisi chook ke, _vustate mulya ko incript nahin karata, haalaaki, nishchit str kii suraksha ke rakrakhaav kii anumati hetu sarwar-wide aadhaar par incripshan ko inebil kiya ja saktaa he
 ASP
NET provides a "cache" target that is shared during use and can also be used to store various targets
 "kaiche" lakshya main keval nirdisht samay kii maatra ke liye data nihit hota he jo ki samay ke guzarane ke saath hi apane aap samaapt ho jaataa he
 Other methods of state management supported by ASP
NET include the use of cookies, catching, and querying strings
 jab pratham baar release kiya jaataa he tab ASP
NET ko templett ingine kii kami hoti he
 Because 
net's framework is goal-oriented and allows inheritance, many developers will define a new base class derived from "system
web
ui
page", the method of writing that renders HTML and Later, we will create the pages obtained from this new category in our application
 While this will allow common elements to be reused on-site, it increases complexity and provides source code with markup
 isse bhi adhik, is vidhi ko aplicoshan ko shuru karke keval dekh kar hi jaancha ja saktaa he, na ki use dizin karte samay
 anya deblopers ne usee nevygation tathaa prayek prishth ke anya tatwon ke karyanvayan se bachane ke liye includ file tathaa anya tareekon ko prayog kiya he
 ASP
NET has introduced the notion of "master pages" that allows template based page development
 ek web aplicoshan main ek yaa ek se adhik master pejes ho sakate hai joki ASP
NET 3
5 se shuru hokar ek saath rakhe ja sakate hai
 The master template has place holder controls called Content Place Holders that display where dynamic content goes, as well as used during HTML and Java-script child pages
 child pejes un contint place holder controls kaa prayog karte hai jise master pej ke place holder se pratichitrit kiya janaa chaiye joki contint pej main nihit hai
 The remaining pages are defined by the shared parts of the master page, such as a mail-merge of the word processor
 contint pej ke sabhi markup tathaa sarwar niyantrak contint place holder niyantrak main hi place kiye jane chaiye
 When a request is made for a content page, ASP
NET combines the output of the content page with the output of the master page and sends the output to the subscriber
 master pej contint pej se puri tarah sugamya rahata he
 This means that the content page can still change the headers, change the title, configure catching, etc
 yadi master pej saarvajanik visheshtaon athwa vidhiyon ko expos karata he to contint pej bhi iskaa prayog kar saktaa he
 Other file extensions interacting with various versions of ASP
NET include: saadharantah ASP
NET nirdeshika dhaancha developers ko praathamikta ke dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 In addition to a few reserved directory names, directories in the site can be extended to any number
 dhaanche ko vishisht rup se pratyakshtah URL main dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Although ASP
NET provides a way to stop instruction at any point during processing, the developer is not obligated to fulfill the request through a central application or front controller
 vishesh nirdeshika naam he: ASP
NET aims at performing performance advantages over other script-based technologies by compiling server-side code for one or more DLL files on a web server
 yah sankalan pratham baar prishth ke anurodh karte hi swayan hi ghatit hota he
 This feature provides easy development through scripting languages with the execution benefits of compiled binaries
 haalanki, sankalan, web prayokta ke liye dhyaan dene yogya parantu sankshipt deree paidaa kar saktaa he, jab web sarwar se naveenatam sankalit prishth kaa pratham baar anurodh kiya ho, parantu tab tak phir se nahin jab tak anurodh kiye prishth ko aage apadet nahin kiya jaataa
 ASPX and other source files are placed in virtual hosts on the Internet Information Services server
 pratham baar clint prishth ke liye anurodh karata he, net dhaancha file ko net asembli main pear tathaa sankalit karata he tathaa pratikriya bhejtaa he; agle anurodh DLL filon se sarv kiye jate hai
 By default, ASP
NET will compile the entire site in batches of 1000 files upon first request
 yadi sankalan kii deree se samasyaain aa rahi hai to, batch kaa aakaar athwa sankalan yojana ko twikd kiya ja saktaa he
 Developers can choose to pre-compile their 'code behind' files before installation using MS Visual, removing the need for just-in-time compilation in the production environment
 yah web sarwar par strot code hone kii aavashyaktaa ko dur karata he
 Microsoft has released some expansion framework to plug into ASP
NET and has expanded its functionality
 unamem se kuch hai: ASP
NET attempts to simplify developers' application development from Windows application development to web development by providing the ability to create pages that are compiled from the same controls as the Windows user interface
 batan athwa label jaise web control vaise hi kaary karte hai jaise uskaa vindose praturup: code apni visheshtaain saunp saktaa he tathaa uski ghatana kii pratikriya vyakt kar saktaa he
 Controls know what to do; While the Windows control draws itself to the screen, the Web Control HTML forms part of the HTML and javascript that forms part of the result page sent to the end-user's browser
 ASP
NET programmer ko ASP tathaa PHP jaise paramparaagat web-scrypting paryaavaran ke bajaay ghatana wahit GUI model kaa prayog karte hue aplications kaa vikaas karne ke liye protsaahit karata he
 Framework, java-script) tries to integrate existing technologies with internal components such as "viewstate" to bring a natural stateless web environment to a firm state
 ASP clasik se tulana karne par anya asamantaain nimnavat hai: Pages written using different versions of the ASP Framework on and below IIS 6
0 cannot share session state without using third-party libraries
 This criticism does not apply to ASP
NET as well as ASP applications running IIS-7
 With IIS-7, modules can run in an integrated pipeline that allows modules to be written in any language to execute any request
 ASP
NET 2
0 web form markup kaa nirmaan karata he jo dablyu thri si vaidhata paas karti he parantu yah vivaadaaspad he ki kya yah sugamyata main vruddhi karata he, jo ki sankethik XHTML pej + CSS pratinidhitiv kaa ek laabh he
 Many controls, such as logging controls and wizard controls, use HTML tables to format by default
 microsoft ne ASP
NET 2
