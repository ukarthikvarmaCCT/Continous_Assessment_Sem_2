 Photography helped immensely in the development of this instrument, because with its help, the spectrographs became available for comparative study permanently
 isi prakashmiti or varnakram kii rekhaon kii tivrata naapane ke sadhano ne varnakramiki dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan main sahyogi banakar, khagoleey pindon kii bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main amuly soochna pradaan kii
 When a gas is lit, according to Kirkhhoff's theory, it radiates only the light of particular characters, not radiating white light
 in varnon ko gas ke lakshanik varna kehete hai
 Which characters will appear in these colors, if they emit white light from the radiant gas in that physical state, then the spectrum of white light does not become black, but the characteristic characters of the gas are absent in it
 iske atirikt yadi shwet prakaash ke udgam kaa taap gas ke taap se unchaa ho, to varncrampatt main gas ke lakshanik varno ke sthaan main kaali rekhaayen, jinhen fronhophar rekhaayen kehete hai, prakat hoti hai
 Based on the study of these black lines, it can be said that in which gas the white light has reached the spectroscope and its gas atoms are in what physical state
 kirkhhof ne is siddhant kaa pratipaadan prayogon ke aadhaar par kiya tha
 But later, with the help of knowledge of atomic structure and quantum theory, the laws of spectroscopy could be theoretically presented
 uparyukt kathan se yah spasht he ki khagolbhautikee ke adhyayan main varnakramiki ke saadhan kii upyogita kii ek swaabhaavik seemaa he
 This is because the spectrograph can give information about the physical state of matter only when the substance is in the form of radiant gas
 at: is saadhan se yah nahin janaa ja sakegaa ki prakaash ke path main sthit pindkhand kin padaarthon ke bane hue hai tathaa unki bhautik avasthaa kya he
 The light that comes from celestial bodies is produced in its internal parts, yet nothing can be said about the composition of those parts with the help of spectroscopy
 vah to keval in pindon ko ghere hue gasmandal ke vishay main hi soochna dene main samarth he
 As a result, to know about the composition and physical state of the internal parts of these bodies, different means are needed from spectral spectra
 in sadhano kaa varnan aage kiya jayega
 In consideration of the means of study, the Tarapind can be divided into two main parts: the inner part and the gasosphere
 varnakram ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par taron ke vishay main anek tathy gyaat kiye ja chuke hai jinamein se pramukh nimnlikhit he: The Sun and other stars are huge spherical bodies of radiant gas, whose surface parts, called dorsal, have thousands of degrees

 The elements that have been identified in these gasmands are also found on earth
 iskaa arth yah kadaapi nahin ki yahan par prithvi par paae janevaale tatwon se bhinn anya tatv nahin honge
 In fact there are such Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of stars which are different from the lines of any element found on earth
 taron ke gas mandal main mukhya rup se hydrogen, helium, carbon, loha aadi upasthit hote hai
 The Indian astrologer, Meghnad Saha, gave his famous thermodynamic formula in 1922, with the help of which the fact of the spectrum strip can be understood
 england ke prasiddh jyotishi adington ke shabdon main saaha sutara, doordarshee ke pashchaat, jyotish main sabase adhik mahatvapurn avishkaar he
 Effective temperature is determined by studying the continuous spectrum of stars
 anveshan main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki tara ek adarsh krishna pind he, jiskaa taatpary yah he ki uskaa prishth is prakaar sangathit he ki vah un sab vikiranon kaa, jo usapar nipaat karte hai, purna rup seavasoshana kar letaa he
 Kirkhhoff and Belfur and Stuart have proved that if the energy of a body does not change, each character has its radiation and absorption volumes in a particular ratio
 krishna shabd kaa pind ke drishy rang se koi sambandh nahin he
 Theoretical, or experimental, studies of such bodies have proved that the intensity of each color is fixed at a particular temperature
 plank ne ooshmaagatiki ke aadhaar par ek sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya he, jo yah bataata he ki ooshmaa gatikeey samya kii avasthaa main adarsh krishna pind ke amuk varna ke vikiran kii amuk tivrata hoti he
 The diagram above shows the relationship between wavelength and radiation intensity
 pind ke die hue taap ke liye vakr or tarangadaidhray ke aksh ke madhya main simit kshetrafal us sampurna urja ko nishchit karata he jiskaa vikiran tara akaash main prati kshan kar rahaa he
 It is also clear from these curves that along with the change in temperature of the body there is also a change in the wavelength of maximum intensity
 vastut: jyon jyon pind ke taap main vruddhi hoti jaati he, mahattam tivrata kaa tarangadaidhray ghatata jaataa he, arthath vah varnakram main drishy bhaag kii ore hatataa jaataa he
 According to Planck's rule for the ideal Krishna body, the formula for revealing the relation of heat and maximum intensity of wavelength is easily determined
 at: taare ke prabhavi taap ko nishchit karne ke liye pehle uske varnakram ke adhyayan se mahattam tivrata ke vikiran kaa tarangadaidhray gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The effective temperature of the star is actually the temperature of that ideal Krishna body whose maximum intensity of radiation is in the same wavelength as that of the star
 taron ke varnakram lekhon main badi bhinnata pai jaati he, parantu phir bhi yadi mukhya mukhya fronhophar rekhaon par hi dhyaan den to in varncrampatton ko kuch virgon ko kuch virgon main baanta ja saktaa he
 In the last century, many astrologers tried to classify stars with the idea of alphabetical order, but the prevailing classification was done in the first years of the current century by Professor Mickering, Mrs
 Fleming and Kumari Kennan at the Harvard Wageshala
 is vargeekaran main kuch aksharon kaa prayog kiya gaya he, jinke varan kaa suvidha ke atirikt or koi vishesh vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 The main classes of this classification are marked with O, B, A, F, C, a and M
 For convenience, each of these classes is divided into ten subclasses
 vyavhaar main taare ke varg kaa nishchay uske varncrampatt kii pramukh avasorana rekhaon kii tivrata ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, jo taap evam daab donon par nirbhar karti hai
 Therefore, the effect of temperature and pressure is considered in the classification in such a way that most of the stars can be divided into two main categories: massive stars and vamana stars and then the intensity of absorption lines in each range varies so regularly that the given intensities For the class of stars, consequently its effective temperature, can be decided exclusively
 diye hue varg ke vishaal taare kaa taap usee varg ke vaaman taare ke taap kii apeksha kam hota he
 Surya is a member of Vamana category
 nimnaankit sarini main in virgon se sangat vaaman shrenee ke taron ke liye prabhavi taap evam varncrampatt kii vishetaayen di gai he: Later on, in order to include the nonspecific observed strings in the classification, at the beginning of this classification, the sum of squares and at the end, n and r were used, and the resulting classification is as follows: varnakramiki ke saadhan ne yah bhi prakat kiya ki bahut se taare, jo bade se bade doordarshee dwaara liye gaye photographon main akele dikhaai dete hai, vastav main do taare hai, jo apane gurutvakentre kii parikrama karte rahete hai
 These stars are called spectral coupler stars
 chumbakeey kshetra main sthit deeptiman gas kii varnakram rekhaayen saadhaaran dasha main vikirit rekhaon kii apeksha adhik vistrut hoti hai tathaa prayek do main or kabhi kabhi adhik uparekhaon main khandit ho jaati he
 This is called the Geman effect
 babakaak ne kuch taron ke varncrampatton main is prabhaav ko vidyaman paaya, jiske aadhaar par usne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki in taron main surya kii bhanti chumbakeey kshetra vidyaman he
 The space between the stars is not completely lacking in substance
 vahaan atyant visarit dhuli tathaa pindkhand vidyaman hai
 For example, in the galaxy, about 25 nodules of radius 10–5 cm per cubic cm are found, one hydrogen atom per cubic cm, and 10–5 cm per cubic km
 is prakaar is sthaan main sthit padaarth kaa ghanatv lagbhag 3n10-24 gram prati ghan senmi0 he
 The density of matter in the star gases is almost the same
 yah kathan akashganga ke anya bhaagon ke vishay main satya nahin he
 It is now known with certainty that the density is different in different parts of each nebula
 taare ke bheetar ke padaarth kii pravriti gas ke ghaney meghon ke rup main vidyaman hone kii pai jaati he
 The mass of these clouds is similar to the beam of stars and sometimes the mass of massive constellations
 yah megh apane peeche sthit taron ke prakaash kaa avasorana hi nahin, varan uskaa prakirnan bhi karte hai, jisase taare kaa prakaash rakt varna kaa abhasith hone lagata he; udaahranarth, prithvi ke vayumandal ke anu sandhya samay surya ke prakaash kaa prakirnan kar surya ko rakt varna pradaan karte hai
 It is only by studying the quantity of this scattering that the determination of the mass of the bodies present in matter within the star is determined
 jaisaa pehle likhaa ja chukaa he, taron ke aantarik sanghatan ko jaanane kaa koi bhautik saadhan uplabdh nahin he
 Hence mathematical means have to be used to study this composition
 awalokit saamagree tathaa bhautik siddhanton ke anukool taron ke aantarik bhaag ke saral praturup kii kalpana kii jaati he or phir is praturup ke bhautik lakshna ganit kii reeti se nishchit kiye hote hai
 If these signs are similar to the star-illuminated signs, then it is concluded that there are similar physical states in the interior of the star as in the model
 aise kitne hi pratirupon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 As a result, proper knowledge of the composition of the interior of the stars has been obtained
 kuch prakaar ke taron kaa punj or unke ardhavyas gyaat hai
 Apart from this, each star has an essential characteristic that it continuously radiates energy everywhere in the sky
 urja ke vikiran kii dar, jise taare kii jyoti kehete hai, taare kaa utana hi mahatvapurn lakshan he jitne uske punj or ardhavyas
 If an outline of the stars and their radii is drawn, it becomes clear that the stars can be divided into approximately three parts
 taron ke punj or jyotishyon kaa rekhachitr bhi is kathan kaa samarthan karata he
 For most stars, their light rotates according to the power of about 3
5 degrees of the beam
 in taron ke samooh ko mukhya shrenee kehete hai

 trumpler taron kii jyoti unke punj ke anupaat main vicharan karti he
 If one compares the stars and radii of the white and vamana of the main class of the same beam, it is found that the white aeration is much less vibrant than the main star and the radius is also much less

 Cranes are heavy lifting machines
 kraine main ek yaa adhik saral mashine lagi hotin hai jo vastuon ko uthaane ke liye yantric laabh pradaan karatin hai taaki ve vasteen bhi uthaayi ja saken jo saamaanya maanav ke uthaane kii kshamta ke pare hai
 Cranes are often used in the traffic industry
 isi prakaar nirmaan udyogon main bhi baari bhaagon ko asembal karne ke liye kraine se uthaanaa padataa he
 Crane lifting machines and their parts from one place to another
 haath kii shakti se kisi baari vastu ko adhik unchaa uthaanaa kathin he isaliye is prakaar ke baari kaam crenon se liye jate hai
 Many types of cranes have been designed and used according to works
 kuch kraine aise hai jo apane sthaan par sthir rahete he
 They can carry loads or machines in only one horizontal direction
 yadi crenon ke neeche chakra laga die jaae to ye kraine bhaar ko ek sthaan par bhi dhokar le jate hai
 The word crane basically means the long rod by which loads or machines are carried, but now the whole machine is called a crane
 is prakaar chad, ghiraniyaan or inke chalaanevaale bhaagon ke sammilit rup ko kraine kehete hai
 Cranes have become particularly popular due to their utility
 kaarkaanon main baari mashiinon ko yathasthaan sthapit karne or bunai hui chizon ko uthaakar le jane ke kaam main ye aate hai
 They are also used for lifting soil in places where rivers, rivulets or dams are being built
 ton kaam haath se maheenon main nahin ho saktaa he vah in crenon se kuch ghanton main hi ho saktaa he
 To understand the working of the crane, see the pulleys of the lateral diagram
 isamen upar neeche do do ghiraniyaan hai or ek hi rassa sab ghiraniyon par se hota hua bhaar tak chalaa jaataa he
 By applying force at point 1, the rope will begin to pull and the load will start to rise
 maan len, bhaar ek foot upar uthta he, to rasse kii chaar lambaaiyaan kam hokar bhaar ko ek foot uthaayengi, kyonki sab ghiraniyon par se rasse kii chaar foot lambaaiyaan gai hai
 So to lift the weight one foot, the rope has to be pulled four feet
 isse puraa bhaar chaaron rasson par bant jaayga or bhaar ko uthaane ke liye bhaar se kam bal kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Similar pulleys are also fitted in cranes where the crane rods start moving as soon as the load is lifted and the load is moved in a vertical and horizontal direction
 kraine do prakaar ke hote hai, ek ghoomanevaala, doosraa na ghoomanevaala
 Rotating cranes are those from which loads can be lifted and cast anywhere in the horizontal direction
 inamen kuchhek aise hai jo apane sthaan se chaaron ore gum jate he or kuch ve hai jo keval 180 degree ke kone par hi ghoomte hai
 These types of cranes are called brahu-cranes
 duusare prakaar ke kraine ve hai jinase bhaar ko uthaakar kraine ko aage yaa peeche, daayen yaa baayein karke, duusare sthaan par rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Cranes of this type are fitted under roofs in factories
 in ko upari kraine kaha jaataa hai, kyonki ye siron ke upar hi upar chalate hai
 Equipment from these cranes can be lifted and placed anywhere in any corner of the factory
 kraine vividh upayon se chalaae jate hai
 Cranes lifting small and heavy parts are driven by hand
 bade crenon ko chalaane ke liye bhapashakti, bijli shakti yaa anbhas shakti kaa upyog hota he
 Power is required only according to work or importance
 haath se chalaae janevaale kraine adhik baari bhaaron ko der tak uthaane ke liye upyogi nahin hote, keval thode hi samay ke liye saamaan uthaanaa ho tabhi ve upyogi hote hai
 If these cranes are to lift heavy machines, more time and more manpower will be required
 at: chote kaamon ke liye hi ye kraine achche rahete hai
 Steam cranes are used for heavy work
 in crenon ke liye bhaap banane kaa vaashpitra yaa to kraine ke saath hi lagi rahata he, athwa ek vaashpitra se hi anek crenon ko bhaap di jaati he
 Cranes that carry an evaporator can be easily moved from one place to another
 inkaa prayog un sthanon par ho saktaa he jahaan bijli nahin hai or baari kaam karnaa ho
 This is necessary at the place where the dam or bridge is being constructed and it is away from the population
 yadi ek sthaan par kai crenon ko kaam karnaa he to har ek ke liye alag alag vaashpitra dene se laagat adhik aegi or har kraine ko chalaane main samay bhi adhik lagegaa
 a large evaporator is installed for such a place, from which all cranes are steamed
 anbhas kraine bahut shaktishaalee or adhik kaam karanevaali hote hai
 This crane can be operated only by opening and closing a valve
 is prakaar ke kraine chitra main dekhen
 In this picture to the left is the Aambhas Rambha, below which a pulley is placed
 iske mesh ke upar ghirani he
 In the picture on the right, one side of the rope or crane is tied in place of the pillar
 yah rassa ghirani tathaa par se hota hua us bhaar par chalaa jaataa he jisko uthaanaa he
 There are a total of three pulleys in this crane
 isliye jab mesh ko ek foot uthaaya jaayga to bhaar chah foot uthegaa, kyonki ghiraniyon par chah rasse hai is prakaar is kraine se bhaar ko kraine ke mesh kii gati se chah guna unchaa uthaaya ja saktaa he
 The use of electrified cranes has increased due to the availability of electricity at low prices
 ye kraine bina kisi kathinaayee ke chalaae ja sakate hai
 Those who run such cranes are also protected from heat and smoke
 motor kii shakti par hi kraine kii shakti aadhaarit he
 The entire load on the crane is rarely used, hence its load ratio is seen to know the strength of the cranes motor
 bhaar anupaat puure samay tathaa kaary ke samay kaa anupaat bataata he
 Suppose the load ratio of a motor is 1 / 3
 iskaa arth yah he ki motor 12 minute main keval teen hi minute puri shakti degi yaa teen minute main keval ek hi minute puri shakti milegi or rukaav do hi minute rahegaa
 Therefore, in such places where the load has to be raised higher and the work has to be done after a short time, the weight-ratio should also be higher
 yadi bhaar kam unchaa uthaanaa he or adhik dur nahin le janaa he, jaisaa un kaarkaanon main hota he jahaan baari bhaar kabhi kabhi uthaae jate hai or vah bhi kam samay ke liye, to adhik bhaar-anupaat ke motor kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 The load-to-load ratio of the motor driving the crane carrying the load at a lower height must be higher than the load-to-weight ratio of the lifting motor
 bhaap se chalanevaali crenon ke vaashpitra ko bhaar uthaate samay hi bhaap dena padataa he
 Therefore, the steamer will sometimes have full load
 jab bhaar ko kaante main bandha ja rahaa ho, athwa kraine bhaar ko daalkar waapas aa rahaa ho, tab vaashpitra se puri bhaap nahin lee jaati or usee samay main vaashpitra apana nipid bana letaa he
 Suppose the crane is powered by a 40 horse power engine
 is ingine ke liye kraine par jo vaashpitra lagaaya jaae uskaa tapakshetra us vaashpitra se, jo iskaa baraabar bhaap dene ke liye aavashyak he, 1 / 4 bhi ho to kaam thik chal jaayegaa
 That is why in cranes bigger good work is done than small evaporators
 isi kaaran kraine kaa aakaar bhi kam rahata he or kharch bhi kam hota he
 Therefore, we can say that if the load-ratio is kept from 1 / 3 to 1 / 6 for the cranes' motors, there will be no side effect on the work of the crane
 bijli ke crenon ke liye shreneevlit motaren hoti hai jinamein baraabar vidyuddhara jaati he or chalane ke samay inkaa bahut adhik anthan hota he
 More force is required when lifting weights, but once lifting weights it does not require so much force
 isliye is motor ke adhik anthan ke kaaran bhaar ko uthaate samay koi kathinaayee nahin hoti
 One of the features of this motor is that it can carry heavier loads at slower speeds and lighter loads at higher speeds
 kraine kaa sarvapratham kaary bhaar ko upar kii ore uthaanaa he
 The weight is lifted by hanging in a fork
 is kaary ke liye ek to lambii dharni kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jisase kraine ke kaam karne kaa kshetra bada ho or duusare is dharni ko chalaane ke liye mashine aavashyak hogi
 The crane shown in Fig
 3
 It has a ground on which the horizontal direction work of this crane depends
 is dharni ke upree bhaag par ek ghirani lagi he jisapar se kraine kii mashiinon se ai zanjeer bhaar uthaanewaale kaante tak chali jaati he
 This chain is long enough and is wrapped on a large cylinder mounted on the crane machine
 kisi bhaar yaa yantra ko uthaate samay mashin ko ulataa ghumaane se zanjeer khulkar neeche chali jaati he or bhaar ko uthaate samay belan sidhaa ghumta he or zanjeer ko apane upar lapetata rahata he
 When the load is lifted, the crane poles rotate and move the load to the place
 sthir crenon main sabase saral kraine chitra saamne dikhalaayaa gaya hai
 The load is lifted up by ropes by placing pulleys between the three-legged derricks
 is prakaar kraine se bhaar ko kshaitij disha main nahin le jaaya ja saktaa
 It is only used to keep the parts of machines on top of each other
 chitra 5
 ke kraine main ek khadey khambhe par ek kshaitij dharni he, jo chaaron ore gum sakati he
 With this type of crane, the load can be carried anywhere
 yadi is kraine ke aadhaar ke neeche pahie laga die jaayan to isko thelkar yaa chalaakar yaa sthaan se duusare sthaan par bhi le jaaya ja saktaa he
 There is a fork on the right side of the ground which can be further back and up
 is dharni ke bain ore ghiraniyaan or kraine ko chalaanevaali mashine hai
 These two parts of Dharni maintain the balance of each other
 dharni ko ghumaanevaale danta khambhe ke upar yaa neeche kii ore kisi bhi sthaan par lagaae ja sakate hai
 a steam-moving crane image is shown
 isamen kraine kaa vaashpitra he, jo ghoomanevaale aadhaar par he
 The engine-driven drum on which the crane chain is wrapped
 isi ke saath saath dharni ko uthaane or giraane ke liye zanjeer ko khinchaa yaa choda jaataa he
 In this way, along with the fork at the time of lifting the load, arrangements are also made to lift the crane's ground
 isse bhaar yatheshtha upar uthaaya ja saktaa he
 After lifting the load, rotate the base of the crane and release the load to the required location
 in crenon ke santulan kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana chahie, kyonki is prakaar ke crenon ke ulatney se durghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 In steam-driven cranes, the steamer only serves as a weighing point, but in other cranes, heavy stones are piled towards the surface
 jaise hi bhaar uthaaya jaataa he peeche ke bhaar uskaa santulan karte he or jaise jaise yah upar uthta he vaise vaise kraine ke centre se isaki duuri kam hoti chali jaati hai
 At this time there is no need to load the back side of the balance of the crane as it was when lifting the load
 isaliye yadi zanjeer tut jaay, yaa peeche itnaa bhaar rakh diya gaya ho ki kraine apana santulan na rakh saken, to kraine ulat jayega
 The overhead crane is shown in Figure 7
 ghiraniyon or mashiinon ko kshaitij dharaniyon par rakhaa jaataa he or yah dharni kaary ke sthaan par sthit rahati he
 If this crane has to be used even at the length of the factory, then it is made by a crane to operate it
 iske liye kaarkaane kii lambaaiwali donon deevaaron par dharaniyan lagaate hai or krainewali dharaniyon ke neeche chakra lagaakar diwarwali dharaniyon par rakh diya jaataa he
 Thus this crane can work on both the length and width of the factory
 aajkal vibhinn prakaar ke crenon kaa upyog ho rahaa he
 The new design is due to new electric machines, but the working principle of every crane is the same as stated above
 bijli kii motor se adhik or aavashyak shakti milti he or iskaa jis prakaar bhi chahen chalaa sakate hai
 It also takes less time to work and reduces costs
 aarodhon ke upyog ke bina crenon se kaam lenaa kathin hota he
 While carrying the load, work is done against struggle and gravity
 jab bhaar ko neeche laayaa jaataa hai to saavdhaanee se laana hota he
 For this purpose, cranes are placed in the cranes, which can prevent the moving crane
 anbhas par kaam karanevaali crenon main to yah kaam iske kapaat se hi le liya jaataa he or phir anbhas aarodh adhik samarth bhi hote hai
 Cranes are mounted on drums of drums
 aavashyaktaa padane par inhen dhol ke upar jakad diya jaataa he or kraine ruk jaataa hai
 These mounting can be done from the location of the crane
 bijli kii crenon main isaki motor kii taron ko is prakaar lagaaya jaataa he ki jab bhaar neeche utaara ja rahaa ho to motor dynamo ban jaay, jisase bijli paidaa hone lagati he or aarodh kaa kaam detii he
 In steam-powered cranes, all the work is done with a two-cylinder engine
