 Meanwhile, in the presence of all the Numinds of the Gavad Valley, this Katyar Than was established only to get rid of Edi
 kyonki isse purv samoochee ghati katyuron kii he
 Afterwards there was agreement between the people of Eidi Deity and the people of Kanouniyon of the four villages

 It is some distance away from the eastern end of the village and beyond the Dhanad Ghazare at some height from a place called Sungaradi
 ab kuch avshesh hi bache rah gayi hai
 It is not hidden from anyone that in ancient times those who are now called divine powers

 This is the place of Gueldarani's proof
 barshon pehle krishi par hi jivan yaapan nirbhar rahata tha or kheti samuchit prakruti va baarish par
 In order to get rid of rain in time and to get rid of excess rain, worship of Gwelderrani was done
 samay badla, log badale, logon kaa vyavsaay va saamaajik swaroop badalane se gwelderani ke prati aasthaa bhi vilupt hoti chali gayi
 Finally, before the end of the nineteenth century, Gvederani, with her grace, disappeared from here forever

 The induction motor is a alternating current motor whose angular speed of the rotor is less than the angular speed of the rotational magnetic field produced by the stator winding
 isi kaaran is motor ko 'atulykaalik motor' kaha jaataa he 
 This is called the 'induction motor' because the current is generated by induction in its rotor because the speed of the rotor and rotational magnetic field are different
 yah motor sabase adhik upyog main aata he jiske kaaran ise udyogon kaa workehorse kehete hai
 There is no wear-resistant component so that it can last for many days without repair
 yah kai prakaar kaa hota he- Most motors used in homes for general tasks and low power are single-phase induction motors, also known as fractional horsepower motors
 udhaaharan ke liye pankhons, dhulaai kii mashiinon ke motor aadi
 Reverse current motors also have field coils and armatures similar to direct current motors, but in some different form
 inamen do mukhya bhaag hote hai : ek to stater, jo sthir rahata he or doosraa roter jo ghumta he
 Reverse current motors are also of different types
 sabase-saamaanya prayavarti dhara motor preran motor he, jo preran ke siddhant par kaary karata he
 In induction motors, the stator coiling is associated with the triplet capacitance, causing a rotational magnetic field
 roter ke chaalak aapas main trikleey kundalan ke rup main bhi ho sakate hai, jo donon siron par taanbe ke valay dwaara laghu paripathit hon
 Such a composition is, in effect, like a squirrel's cage
 at: aise motaron ko saamanyat: 'gilahari panjar preran motor', athwa keval 'panjar motor' hi kehete hai
 These motors are very strong in design as well as are simple and cheap
 inaki dakshata bhi usee aakaar ke duusare motaron kii apeksha unchi hoti he
 Hence the use of these motors is often universal
 parantu in motaron kaa prachaalan, ek prakaar se, roter kii banaavat se anusaar nishchit hota he or usamen aavashyaktaa ke anusaar parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Their initial force is very low, which is necessary to insert some resistance in the rotor circuit to improve, but this is not possible due to the formation of stable type
 saath hi sthaayee taur par roter chaalkon kaa pratirodh bhi adhik nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki aisa karne par haani adhik bad jaaegi or motor kii dakshata ghat jaaegi
 In order to achieve more initial, forced bipeder motors are used, which have two toes instead of one
 roter ke khaanchon ke praroop tathaa unki sthiti ke anusaar prachaalan lakshanon main kuch vibhinnata praapt kii ja sakati he or unhen vividh prayojanon ke yogya banaaya ja saktaa he
 The synchronous speed ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} of an AC motor is the speed of the rotational magnetic field of its stator
 iskaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se nikaala ja saktaa he- Where f { \ displaystyle f} is the frequency of supply of the motor and p { \ displaystyle p} is the number of magnetic poles, for example, 50 Hz supply and, for a 6-pole three-phase motor, p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 and ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} = 1,000 RPM slip s { \ displaystyle s} ko praayah nimnlikhit prakaar se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- Where ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} synchronous speed, nr { \ displaystyle n_ {r}} the rotor speed if the rotor is moving at synchronous speed, the value of slip will be zero if the rotor is not moving at all
 The value will be 1
 motor dwaara utpann balaghurna kaa maan uske roter kii slip par nirbhar karata he
 Which is called 'slip-torque specification'
 spasht he ki preran motor 'lagbhag' sthir chaal par chalate hai
 Their gait variance is very less with weight
 at:, jin bhaaron ke liye sthir chaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, vahaan ve bahut upyogi hote hai
 However, motor motors are not commonly used where variable speed is required
 inaki chaal tulykaalik chaal se kuch hi kam hoti he, jo dhruv sankhya tathaa aavriti par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, to move around, it is necessary to either change the pole number, or to vary the frequency
 aavriti vicharan karne kaa taatpary he ki alag aise sambharan kii vyavastha karnaa jisaki aavriti badali ja sake
 Nowadays variable frequency drives are coming for this
 dhruv sankhya ko ek vishisht anupaat main, kundalan ke sambandhan main parivartan karke badla ja saktaa he, jaise ek 4 dhruvi motor ko 8 dhruvi athwa 6 dhruvi motor main parivartit karnaa sambhav he
 Thus the velocities corresponding to these pole numbers can also be obtained
 50 chakree aavriti par 4 dhruvi motor kii tulykaalik chaal 1,500 RPM or 6 dhruvi tathaa 8 dhruvi kaa kramash: 1,000 tathaa 750 RPM he
 In this way, by changing the pole number of such motor, its speed can be obtained
 par ye keval do yaa teen kramon main hi ho sakate hai
 By this method it is not possible to get the variance in a wide range
 kuch nishchit kramon main chaal vicharan kii ek duusari vidhi "sopanipat niyantran" kehalaati he
 This method is mostly used in rolling mills
 vibhinn prakaar ke mashin aujaaron main bhi vicharanshil chaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, parantu unamem saamanyat:, chaal vicharan giyar kramon ko badalakar kiya jaataa he

 jalmahal rajasthan kii rajdhani jaipur ke manasagar jhil ke madhya sthit prasiddh aitihaasik mahal he
 Located in the womb of the Aravalli hills, this palace is also called 'eye Ball' because it is in the middle of the lake
 ise 'romantic mahal' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 This palace, built by Jaisingh, is a double-edged and square building with medieval palaces like arches, burjos, chhatris and step-step genes
 jalmahal ab pakshi abhyaaran ke rup main bhi viksit ho rahaa he
 The nursery here has more than 1 lakh trees, where the tallest trees of Rajasthan are found
 jaipur-amer maarg par manasagar jhil ke madhya sthit is mahal kaa nirmaan savai jaisingh ne ashwamedh yajna ke baad apni raniyon or pandit ke saath snaan ke liye karavaaya tha
 Before the construction of this palace, Jaisingh constructed a dam on the gestational river for the water supply of Jaipur and constructed the Mansagar lake
 iskaa nirmaan 1799 main hua tha
 For this construction, the help of Rajput style boats was taken
 raja is mahal ko apni rani ke saath khaas vakt bitaane ke liye istemaal karte the
 They also used it on royal festivals
 madhyakaalin mehalon kii tarah mehrabon, burjo, chhatriyon evam seedheedaar jeenon se yukt dumanjila or vargakar rup main nirmit bhawan he
 The bastion's chhatris on the four corners of its upper storey and the Baradariya in the middle are based on marble columns
 tapate registan ke bich based is mahal main garmi nahin lagati, kyonki iske kai tal pani ke andar banaae gaye hai
 a beautiful view of the mountain and lake can also be seen from this palace
 chandani raat main jhil ke pani main is mahal kaa najaara behad aakarshak hota he
 Jalmahal is now also developing as a bird sanctuary
 jal mahal ke nursery main 1 lakh se zyada vriksh lage hue hai
 Day and night, 40 Mali trees are engaged in plant care
 yah nursery rajasthan kaa sabase unche pedo vaala nursery he
 There are thousands of variations of Aravali plant, ornamental plant, sorb, hedge and creeper
 yahan ke 150 varsh puraane pedo ko transplant kar nayaa jivan diya gaya he
 Every year showplants like Date Palm, China Palm and Buganbelia are transplanted here

 Text is written in a Hindi editor, it works on the basis of a database of pronunciation of characters
 kisi bhashaa main jin siddhanton evam prakriyaaon ke dwaara vaakya banate hai, unke adhyayan ko bhashaa vigyaan main vaakyavinyas, 'vaakyavigyaan' yaa cintax kehete hai
 The serial study of a sentence is called 'syntaxology'
 vaakya vigyaan, padon ke parsparik sambandh kaa adhyayan he
 The sentence is the most important part of the language
 manushya apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti vaakyon ke madhayam se hi karata he
 Hence, sentence is the shortest complete unit of language
 vaakya vigyaan ke antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he- vaakya kii paribhaasha, vaakyon or bhashaa ke anya ag kaa sambandha, vaakyon ke prakaar, vaakyon main parivartan, vaakyon main padon kaa kram, vaakyon main parivartan ke kaaran aadi
 Dr
 Kapil Dev Dwivedi has discussed in detail about the nature of syntax
 unka mat is prakaar haih- The difference between phraseology and syntax is that creation of terms is discussed in the post-science
 atah usamen pad vibhaajan, kaarak, vibhakti, vachan, ling, kaal, purush aadi ke bodhak shabd kis prakaar banate hai, is par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Syntax is next to that
 isamen purvakt vidhi se bane hue padon kaa kahan, kis prakaar se rakhane se arth main kya antar hota he, aadi vishyon kaa vivechan he
 Sound is a building element
 jaise mitti, kapaas aadi; pad bane hue ve tatva hai, jinka upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jaise- eent, vastra aadi; vaakya vah rup he, jo vaastavik rup main prayog main aata he, jaise- makaan, sile vastra aadi
 If the verse is a brick then the sentence is a house or building
 tattvik drushti se dhwani, pad or vaakya main moulik antar he
 Voice is basically related to pronunciation
 yaa shaareerik vyapaar se utpann hoti he, atah dhwani main mukhyatya shaareerik vyapaar pradhan he
 The verse coordinates both sound and meaning
 dhwani shaareerik paksh he or sarthakata maansik paksh he
 The coordination of both physical and mental elements in the verse makes it suitable for use in a sentence
 sarthakata kaa sambandh vichaar se he
 Thought is the work of the mind, so there is mental business in the post
 vaakya main vichaar, vichaaron kaa samanvay, sarthak evam samanvit rup main abhivyakti, ye sabhi kaary vichaar or chintan se sambhddha he, atah maansik kaary he
 The mental or psychological aspect is important in a sentence
 vichaaron kii purna abhivyakti vaakya se hoti he, atah vaakya hi bhashaa kaa sookshmatam sarthak ikai mana jaataa he
 Their distinction can also be revealed in this way- nasiruddin mohammad shah 1719 se 1748 tak mogul badshaah the
 Baba Raghavdas was a saint of India and a fighter of the Indian freedom struggle
 unhen 'purvanchal kaa gandhi' kaha jaataa he
 Baba Raghavdas was born on 12 December 1896 in Pune into an elite Brahmin family
 unke pita kaa naam shri sheshppa or mata kaa naam shrimati gita tha
 His father was a noted businessman
 baba raghavdas ke bachapan kaa naam raghavendra tha
 Raghavendra had to be separated from his family forever as a child, because Raghavendra's green family was plagued by a plague-like epidemic
 1913 main 17 varsh kii avasthaa main raghavendra ek siddh guru kii khoj main apane praant ko alavida kar die or prayag, kaashi aadi tirthon main vicharan karte hue gajipur pahunche jahaan unki bhent mounibaba naamak ek sant se hui
 Mounibaba taught Hindi to Raghavendra
 gajipur main kuch samay bitaane ke baad raghavend barhaj pahunche or vahaan ve ek prasiddh sant yogiraj anant mahaprabhu se diksha lekar unke shishy ban gaye
 After meeting Gandhiji in 1921, Baba Raghavdas jumped into the freedom struggle to realize the dream of independent India and continued to do public service as well
 swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan is karmyogi ko kai baar jail kii hawa bhi khaani padi par maan bharti kaa yah sachcha laal vichlit na hote hue purna nishtha ke saath apana karm karata rahaa
 In 1931, to make Gandhi's Salt Satyagraha successful, Raghavbaba held public meetings at many places in the area and alerted the public

 Onion was a medical psychologist from Switzerland who is famous for his work on child development
 piyaaje, vikasaatmak manovigyaan ke kshetra main ek badi hasti hai
 We are indebted to Piaget for many erudite concepts that still have the ability and charm to last today, such as adjustment / assimilation, customizable object stability, autism, conservation, and hypothetical-corporate thinking
 bacchon ke sakriy, rachanaatmak vichaarak hone kii vartmaan drushti ke liye bhi ham, wiliam james tathaa jon dui ke saath-saath, piyaaje ke rini hai
 Piag had a unique talent for observing children
 uske saavdhaneepurvak kiye gayi prekshanon ne hamen yah khojane ke sooyeeboojh bhare tareeke dikhaaye ki bachche kaise apane sansar ke saath kriya karte hai or talmail bithaate hai
 Piaget taught us to find certain things in cognitive development, such as the shift from pre-operative thinking to tangible operational thinking
 usne hamen yah bhi dikhaaya ki kaise bacchon ko apane anubhavon kii sangat apni yojanaon, sangyanatmak dhaanchon or saath hi saath apni yojanaon kii sangat apane anubhavon se bithaane kii jarurat hoti he
 Piaget also showed that if the structure of the environment is such that there is a facility to move slowly from one level to another, then there is a possibility of cognitive development
 ham ab is prachlit manyata ke liye bhi uske rini hai ki avadharanaen achaanak apane puure swaroop main prakat nahin ho jaatin, balki ve aisi choti-choti aanshik uplabdhiyon kii shrinkhalaa se hoti hui viksit hoti hai jinke parinaam swaroop kramshah adhik paripurna samaj paidaa hoti he
 Piagas have had a great impact on education, especially during early and middle childhood
 uski mimasaa se nikle teen siddhanton kaa aaj bhi shikshakon ke prashikshan par or kaksha ke bheetar apanaaye jane vaale taur tareekon par vyapak asar hota he
 In the class following the Piag, children are encouraged to explore things by themselves, spontaneously / spontaneously acting with the surroundings
 pehle se taiyaar gyaan ko shabdic rup se prastut karne ke bajaay, shikshak aisi vividh gatividhiyon kii suvidha pradaan karte hai jo khojane ko badhaava detii hai- jaise kala, pahelion, mej vaale khel, vibhinn paridhaan, chijen banane vaale guttey, kitaaben, naapane ke aujaar, sangeet, vaadya tathaa or bhi bahut kuch
 Piaget class does not try to increase the speed of development
 piyaaje maanata tha ki bacchon ke seekhney ke upyukt anubhav unki taatkaalik soch se hi viksit hote hai
 Teachers look at children carefully, listen to them, and provide them with experiences in which they can practice newly discovered plans and challenge the wrong ways of looking at their world
 lekin shikshak bacchon par koi naye kaushal nahin thopate jab tak ve unamem ruchi or unke liye taiyaari nahin dikhaate, kyonki aisa karne se ve vayaskon ke sutron ko satahi dhang se sweekaar kar lete hai, par usase sachhee samaj paidaa nahin hoti
 Piaget's theory assumes that all children go through the same sequence of development, but their pace / pace varies
 isliye shikshakon ko alag-alag vidhyaarthiyon ke liye or chote-chote samoohon ke liye gatividhiyon kii yojana bananaa chahie, naa ki ek saath puri kaksha ke liye
 In addition, when comparing educational progress, teachers compare each child with his or her previous position
 unki ruchi is baat main kam hoti he ki bachche kinhin maanak staron ke saapeksh yaa ki samaan umr ke bacchon ke ausat pradarshan ke saapeksh kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 Piaget's theory could not remain free from challenges
 uske in kshetron par prashn uthaaye gayi hai : How children think about moral issues; The onion aroused interest in it
 unhone bahut adhik gaharaai se chaar se baarah saal ke umr ke bacchon kaa avlokan or saakshaatkaar kiya
 Piazza saw the children playing marbles to know how the children thought about the rules of the game
 unhone bacchon se naitik muddon ke bare main bhi baat kii
 Piaget found that when children think about morality, they go through two different stages
 chunki chote bachche bahari satta vaali naitikta ke str par hote he, ve kisi ke vyavhaar ke bare main sahi yaa galat kaa nirnay us vyavhaar se hone vaale parinaamon ko dekhakar lete hai, na ki vyavhaar kartta ke uddeshyon ke aadhaar par
 For example, the incident of breaking 12 cups in an accident is worse for them than a cup that was intentionally broken
 jaise bachche swatantra avasthaa par aane lagate hai, vaise-vaise kisi kaam ko karne vaale kaa uddeshy / iraadaa unke naitik chintan kaa ek aavashyak bindu banane lagata he
 Children who think ethically on the basis of external power also believe that the rule is an unchangeable thing and that these rules are made by a powerful authority
 pyaaje ne chote bacchon ko sujhaayaa ki vah kanche ke khel ke nae niyam banaaen, to chote bacchon ne manaa kar diya
 The older children, on the other hand, accepted the change and recognized that the rules were made just for our convenience, which could be changed
 bahari satta ke aadhaar par naitik chintan karne vaale bachche 'turant nyaay' kii dharna main bhi vishwaas rakhte hai
 That is, if a rule is broken then punishment should also be met
 chote bachche maanate hai ki agar kisi cheez ko khandit kiya yaa todaa gaya he tab yah kaam apane aap sajaa se jud jaataa he
 That is why whenever young children do something wrong, they start looking around them worrying that they will get punishment
 turant nyaay kaa siddhanth yah bhi kahata he ki agar kisi ke saath kuch durbhagyapurna hua ho to us vyakti ne jarur pehle kuch kiya hoga, jiske parinaswaroop aisa hua
 Older children who seem to have the freedom of morality recognize that punishment is only given when someone has seen something wrong and even after that punishment is not necessary
 naitik tark ko lekar is tarah ke parivartan kaise aate hai? piyaaje maanate hai ki jaise-jaise bachche bade hote he unki soch saamaajik muddon ke bare main gahari hoti chali jaati he
 Onion believes that social understanding comes from mutual dealings with peers
 jin saathiyon ke paas ek jaisi shakti or ohada hota he vahaan yojanaon ke bich samjhauta kiya jaataa he or sahamat na hone par tark diya jaataa he or aakhir main sab kuch thik ho jaataa he
 In parent and child relationships where the parent has power but not the children, it is less likely to develop an understanding of moral reasoning because most rules are given in an orderly manner
 motetor par shikaayat yaa parivednaa ke antargat aisi sabhi likhit shikaayatein aatin hai jo mazdooree, bhugtan, adhisamay kaary, chuttee, sthanantaran, padonnati, varishthata, seva mukti, seva anubandh ke vivechan, kaary kii dashaon yaa kisi forman, suparvizer, mashin va aujaar, cantine evam manoranjan kii suvidhaon aadi se sambandhit hon
 Various scholars of Parivedana have defined the following: del bich ke vichaar se, parivednaa aise asantosh va anyaay kii bhaavana he, jo koi vyakti apane rojgaar kii sthiti main anubhav karata he or jiske liye prabandhak kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya jaataa he

 muktak kavy yaa kavita kaa vah prakaar he jisamen prabandhakiyata na ho
 In this, the said matter in one verse does not have any relation or relevance to what is said in the other verse
 kabir evam rahim ke dohe; mirabai ke padya aadi sab muktak rachanaaen hai
 Most of the Muktak Kavyas were composed in the Hindi language
 muktak shabd kaa arth he ‘apane aap main sampoorn’ athwa ‘anya nirpeksh vastu’ hona
 at: muktak kavy kii vah vidha he jisamen katha kaa koi purvapar sambandh nahin hota
 prayek chand apane aap main purnat: swatantra or sampoorn arth dene vaala hota he
 In the Sanskrit poetry tradition, the word Muktak was first introduced by Anandvardhan
 It cannot be assumed that no one had knowledge of this direction of poetry before
 Acharya Dandi was acquainted with the name Muktak not as a right but an undefined poem
 Defining Muktak in 'agnipuran' said that: ”muktakan shloke evaikshchamatkaaraksham: satam” That is, the only one who has the ability to perform miracles is called Muktak
 Rajashekhar has also discussed the name Muktak
 Giving importance to Rasa, Anandvardhan said in relation to Muktak: ”tatra muktakeshu rasabandhabhiniveshin: kave: tadashrayamauchityam” That is, the abhinivesh or prestige of the rasa in Muktakas is the administrator of his bond and it is justified by the poet to take shelter of the same
 hemachandracharya ne muktak shabd ke sthaan par muktkaadi shabd kaa prayog kiya
 unhone uskaa lakshan dandi kii parampara main dete hue kaha ki jo anibaddh hon, ve muktadi hai
 In the modern era, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla of Hindi considered Muktak
 According to him: muktak main prabandh ke samaan ras kii dhara nahin rahati, jisamen katha-prasang kii paristhiti main apane ko bhuulaa hua pathak magn ho jaataa he or hriday main ek sthaayee prabhaav grahan karata he
 isamen to ras ke aise chhinte padate hai, jinamein hriday-kalika thodi der ke liye khil uthati he
 yadi prabandh ek vistrut vanasthali he, to muktak ek chunaa hua guladasta he
 isi se yah samaajon ke liye adhik upyukt hota he
 isamen uttarottar drishyon dwaara sangathit purna jivan yaa uske kisi purna ang kaa pradarshan nahin hota, balki ek romantic khand-drishy is prakaar sahasaa saamne laa diya jaataa he ki pathak yaa shrota kuch kshanon ke liye mantrmugdh sa ho jaataa he
 iske liye kavi ko manoram vastuon or vyapaaron kaa ek chota stavak kalpit karke unhen atyant sankshipt or shashakt bhashaa main pradarshit karnaa padataa he
 Acharya Shukla had said that the free power of language and the power of imagination was necessary for Muktak elsewhere
 Impressed by that, Govind Trigunayat presented the following definition: meri samaj main muktak us rachana ko kehete hai jisamen prabandhatv kaa abhaav hote hue bhi kavi apni kalpana kii samaahaar shakti or bhashaa kii samaaj shakti ke sahare kisi ek romantic drishy, paristhiti, ghatana yaa vastu kaa aisa chitratmak evam bhavpurn varnan prastut karata he, jisase pathakon ko prabandh jaisaa anand aane lagata he
 Actually this definition is flawed
 It is not appropriate to say enjoyment like management
 In such a situation, the following definition of Muktak is also given:
