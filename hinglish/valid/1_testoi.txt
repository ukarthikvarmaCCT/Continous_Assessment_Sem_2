 Durgadas preached a number of times, explained and extinguished a lot, but the way a drop of water stops on a lotus leaf, and falls immediately from the wind, similarly something on the heart of Ajitsinh The preaching was effected, immediately selfish friends threw it out and even tried that Maharaja's arbitrariness took place on behalf of Durgadas
 dhire-dhire anyaay badhata hi gaya
 Being compelled, Durgadas sent his family to Udaipur and lived alone in Jodhpur and waited for the consequences of injustice

 Taking the opportunity one day was going to the court to take leave from Maharaj
 raste main ek vruddh manushya mila, jo durgadas kaa shubhachintak tha
 Brother Durgadas started saying! Would have been nice if you didn't go to the court today; Because you are not skilled in going to the court today
 mujhe jahaan tak pataa chalaa he vah yah ki maharaj ne apane swaarthee mitron kii salaah se aapke maar daalane kii gupt rup se ajna di he
 Durgadas said - 'brother! Now i am old, i have to die, then why should i fear death by being a Kshatriya? Stigma in Rajputi; Afraid of death, go back! Saying thus, Nirbhay reached the court like Singh and with folded hands asked the Maharaja for a pilgrimage
 maharaj ne upree man se kaha – ‘ chachaaji! aapkaa viyog hamaare liye bada dukhad hoga; parantu ab aap vruddh hue hai, or prashn tirthayatr kaa he; isliye nahin bhi nahin kii jaati
 Well, go back as soon as possible
 durgadas ne kaha – ‘ maharaj kii jaisi ajna or chal diya; parantu dwaar tak jaakar lautaa
 Maharaj asked uncle, why? Durgadas said - 'maharaj, i will not go today; i just remembered that Maharaj Yashwant Singh had given me the key to a secret treasure, but till now i could neither tell you the secret treasure nor could i give the key; Therefore, i should also hand it to you, then go? Because now i am very old, i do not know when and where i die
 Then this unlimited amount of paddy will be found in all the soil
 yah sunakar ajitsingh ko lobh ne dabaa liya
 Who in the world is not surrounded by greed? Who has violated the command of the greed god? Started thinking; If according to my knowledge Durgadas was killed somewhere, then this property will not come into his hands
 kya or avasar na milegaa? phir dekha jaayga
 Thinking this, he indicated to his friends

 The development of Scots, mainly independently, was of similar origin but after the Act of the Union, 1707, a process of language attrition began under which successive generations adopted more and more characteristics of English, resulting in it as a dialect of English
 i was developed
 varttman main is baat par vivaad chal rahaa he ki yah ek pruthak bhashaa he athwa angreji kii ek boli maatr he jise scottish angreji kaa naam diya gaya he
 Traditional types of pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary differ from other varieties in English, sometimes in large quantities
 angreji ke duusari bhashaa ke rup main vyapak prayog ke kaaran iske vaktaaon ke lahazebhi bhinn prakaar ke hote hai jinase vaktaa kii sthaneey boli athwa bhashaa kaa pataa chalata he
 For more specific features of regional accents, see 'regional accents of English' and for more specific features of regional dialects see the list of dialects of English language
 In England, the distinction is now confined to pronunciation rather than grammar or dictionary

 a number of English based Pidgin and Creole languages have been formed, such as Jamaican Patois, Nigerian Pidgin and Tok Pisin
 Many words have been composed in the English language to describe the types of non-english languages that are full of English words
 yahan * kaa arth un swaron par nishaan lagaana he jo hindi ke dhwani-tantra main nahin hote, yaa jinka shuddh uccharan adhikansh bhartiya nahin kar pate
 English is an intonation language
 iskaa arth yah he kii vaani ke utaar chadhaav ko paristhiti ke anusaar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 For example, expressing surprise or sarcasm, or turning a statement into a question
 angreji main, intonaton pattern shabdon ke samooh par hote hai jinhen tone samooh, tone ikai, intonaton samooh yaa indriya samoohon ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Tone groups are called in a single breath, hence their length is limited
 ye ausatan paanch shabd lambe hote hai or lagbhag do second main khatam ho jate hai
 for example : angreji ek bahut jor de kar bolne vaali bhashaa he
 Some syllables of both words and sentences get more importance / emphasis at the time of pronunciation while others do not
 The first type of syllables are called accentuated / stressed and the latter ones are unenxcited / unstressed
 is prakaar ek vaakya main prayek tone samooh ko shabdaanshon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he jo kii yaa to stressd honge yaa anstroped 
 stressd shabdaansh newclear shabdaansh kaha jaataa he
 for example: vaas da best thing you kud hev dan !' All syllables here are unstressed, except the best and the dun, which are stressed
 best par jor thodaa adhik diya gaya he isliye yah newclear shabdaansh he
 The nuclear syllable describes the main point of the speaker
 udhaaharan ke liye: This also yah bhaavana vyakt karne ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: Nuclear syllables are spoken in a much louder tone, and there is a distinct change in the tone of speech
 is lahaze ke sabase saamaanya badlaav hai aawaaj ko unchaa karnaa or aawaaj ko nichaa karnaa, haalaanki girti-chadhati aawaaj or chadhati-girti aawaaj kaa bhi yada kada istemaal hota he
 The importance of raising and lowering the voice in English language is much more than other languages
 nichi aawaaj main bolnaa nischitata darshata he or unchi aawaaj main bolnaa anischitata
 iskaa arth par ek mahatvapurn prabhaav pad saktaa he, khaskar sakaaratmak athwa nakaaratmak drushtikon ko darshane main; nichi aawaaj main bolne kaa matlab he aapkaa "drushtikon gyaat" he or chadhati hui aawaaj kaa matlab "drushtikon agyaat" he
 The same is behind the rising voice of yes / no questions
 udhaaharan ke liye: The vowels vary in each region
 jahaan pratik jode main drishy hai, pehla america angreji ke saamaanya america uccharan se mail khaataa he, doosraa british angreji ke praapt uccharan se mail khaataa he
 It is the English consonant system using symbols from the international phonetic alphabet

 Case marking has almost disappeared from the language and today it is mainly used in pronouns
 germanik mul se praapt majboot banaam kamjor kriya ke swaroop kaa aadhunik angreji main mahatva ghat gaya he or ghumaav ke avasheshon kaa upyog bad gaya he
 Presently, the language has become more analytical and tools such as technological verbs and word order have been developed to explain the meaning
 sahaayak kriyaayen prashnon, nakaaratmakataa, pasive vois or pragatisheel pahaluon ko darshaati hai
 Since English is a Germanic language, most of its daily usage vocabulary comes from ancient German
 iske atirikt bhi angrezi main kai rinshabd hai
 According to a survey, the situation is: angreji shabdaawalee sadiyaan bitne ke saath kaaphi badal gayi he
 Like many languages from proto-indo-european, the origin of the most common English words can be traced to the PIE
 in shabdon main shaamil hai buniyadi sarvnaam ' jaise ai, puraani angreji ke shabd isi se,, me, sankhyayen ", duo, tris), saamaanya paariwarik sambandh jaise kii mata, pita, bhai, bahan aadi, kai jaanwaron ke naam or kai aam kriyaayen 
 Germanic words are shorter than Latin words in English and they are more common in common colloquial usage
 isamen lagbhag sabhi buniyadi sarvnaam, purvasarg, sanyojak, dyotak kriyaayen aadi shaamil hai jo kii angreji ke buniyadi vaakyavinyas or vyakaran ko banaati hai
 Longer Latin words are often considered more ornate and educated
 haalaanki latin shabdon ke zarurat se zyada prayog ko dikhaawati athwa mudda chhipaane kii ek koshish mana jaataa he
 George Orwell's essay "politics and English" criticizes this and other alleged misuse of language
 is niabandh ko angreji bhashaa kii ek mahatvapurn samiksha mana jaataa he
 An English speaker is allowed to choose from Latin and Germanic synonyms: less or arrives; Site or vision; Freedom or Liberty
 In some cases, there is an option to choose from a Germanic derived word, a Latin derived word and a French word derived from the same Latin word
 vividh arthon or baarikiyon ko samete ye paryaayavachi shabd vaktaaon ko baariq bhed or vichaaron kii bhinnata ko vyakt karne main sahaayak hote hai
 Knowledge of the history of synonyms can give English speakers greater control over their language
 dekhen: angreji main jarmenic or latin samakakshon kii soochi
 There is an exception and a feature that is probably only found in the English language
 vah yah he kii, gosht kii sangya aamtaur par use pradaan karne vaale jaanavar kii sangya se bhinn or asambandhit hoti he
 The animal usually has a Germanic name and the meat is derived from the French
 udahaaran, hiran or venisan ; gaay or bif ; boar / pig or pork, tathaa bhed or matan 
 ise norman akraman kaa parinaam mana jaataa he, jahaan anglo-sexn nimna varg dwaara pradaan kiye gaye gosht ko french bolne vaale abhijaat varg ke log khate the
 During a debate, the speaker prefers to use these words to express his or her speech directly, because most of the words used in informal environments are usually Germanic
 adhikansh latin shabdon kaa prayog aamtaur par aupchaarik bhaashan athwa lekhan main hota he, jaise kii ek adaalat athwa ek vishwakosh lekh
 haalaanki anya latin shabd bhi hai jinka upyog aamtaur par saamaanya bolchaal main kiya jaataa he or ve zyada aupchaarik bhi prathit nahin hote hai; ye shabd mukhyata avadharanaon ke liye hai jinka koi jarmenic shabd ab nahin bachaa he
 Their synergy is better in context and in many cases they do not even appear to be Latin
 udahaaran, ye sabhi shabd latin hai: pahaad, tarai, nadi, chachee, chachaa, chalanaa, upyog dhakka or rahanaa 
 English readily accepts technical words and often imports new words and sentences
 iske udahaaran hai, samakaleen shabd jaise kii kuki, internet or URL ,jiner, uber, lingua franca or emigo 
 iske alaava, theth shabd aksar puraane shabdon or vaakyanshon ko nayaa arth pradaan karte hai
 In fact, this fluidity is so obvious that there is often a need to distinguish between the contemporary usage of English and its formal types

 there is absolutely no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible circumference
 The English vocabulary is undoubtedly vast, but assigning a number to it would come under more definition than calculation
 Unlike the French, German, Italian and Spanish languages, there is no academy to define officially accepted words and quantities for the English language

 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis

 Both believed that Hindus would be divided into casteism, untouchability, urban-migrants and regionalism, till Hindus would not leave blind faith, old orthodox thinking, religious fanatics, and until it would be organized and united, Until then, he will not be able to take his rightful place in the world

 ganit main dirikhle pareekshan kisi shrenee ke abhisaran ke pareekshan kii ek vidhi he
 It was named posthumously after its author Peter Gustaf Ljan Derikle's publication in the 'journal de Mathematics Pure et Applicieux'
 pareekshan ke kathan ke anusaar yadi { a n } { \ displaystyle \ {a_{n} \ }} ek vaastavik anukram he or { b n } { \ displaystyle \ {b_{n} \ }} sammishra anukram he jo nimna sambandhon ko santusht karte hai: Where m is a constant, then the range abhisari hogi
 Let s n = ∑ k = 0 nakbk { \ displaystyle S_ {n} = \ sum _ {k = 0} ^ {n} a_ {k} b_ {k}} and b n = ∑ k = 0 nbk { \ displaystyle B_ {n} = \ sum _ {k = 0} ^ {n} is b_ {k}}
 ghatakon main sankalan se ham s n = a n + 1 b n + ∑ k = 0 n b k { \ displaystyle s_{n}=a_{n+1}b_{n}+ \ sum _{k=0}^{n}b_{k}} praapt karte hai
 Since an → 0 { \ displaystyle a_ {n} \ rightarrow 0} is bounded by b n { \ displaystyle B_ {n}} M, for n → ∞ these terms are leading to zero an + 1 b n → 0 { \ displaystyle will be a_ {n + 1} B_ {n} \ to 0}
 anya vidhi se, chunki anukram a n { \ displaystyle a_{n}} hrasman he, a k − a k + 1 { \ displaystyle a_{k}-a_{k+1}} sabhi k ke liye dhanatmak he, atah | b k | ≤ m { \ displaystyle |b_{k}| \ leq M} dwaara paribaddh he
 Therefore, the partial sum of Bn and the value of its multiplier will be less than the partial sum of Bn and the same multiple
 lekin ∑ k = 0 n m = m ∑ k = 0 n { \ displaystyle \ sum _{k=0}^{n}m=m \ sum _{k=0}^{n}}, jo ek antarvedhan shrenee he or iskaa maan m { \ displaystyle M} ke baraabar he atah n→∞ ke liye m a 0 { \ displaystyle Ma_{0}} kii ore agrasar he
 Hence ∑ k = 0 ∞ m { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = 0} ^ { \ infty} M} converges
 isi tarah ∑ k = 0 ∞ | b k | { \ displaystyle \ sum _{k=0}^{ \ infty }|b_{k}|} bhi sidhe tulana pareekshan se abhisarit hoti he
 The range ∑ k = 0 ∞ b k { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = 0} ^ { \ infty} B_ {k}} converges with absolute convergence
 isiliye s n { \ displaystyle S_{n}} abhisari he

 4
 The formation of NATO brought an end to the policy of American secession and could no longer remain neutral to European issues
 5
 nato ke gathan ne shityudh ko badhaava diya
 The Soviet Union saw this in opposition to communism and in response tried to establish its influence in the Eastern European countries by a military organization called Warsaw Pact
 6
 nato ne america videsh niti ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 Unable to listen to any kind of debate against its global policy, and through NATO, America's excessive intervention in Europe increased
 7
 europe main america ke atyadhik hastkshep ne europea deshon ko yah sochane ke liye baadhya kiya ki europe kii saamaajik-aarthik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan europea drushtikon se hal kiya janaa chahie
 This approach paved the way for the formation of a "european Community"

 warsaw pact bhi samaapt ho gaya
 But the US did not dissolve the dramas, instead the dramas under American leadership expanded further
 isi bindu par yah sawaal uthta he ki shityudh kaaleen daur main nirmit is sanghathan kaa sheet yuddh ke ant ke baad maujuud rahane kaa kya auchity he
 The role of the Natas was redefined by the US in the post-cold War era
 iske tahat kaha gaya ki sampoorn europe ke kshetron main yah parsparik sahyog or sambandhon ke vikaas kaa madhyam he
 Not only this, he also tried to legitimize the role of dramas in the development and propagation of democratic values and ideals

 NATO is now considered important under peacekeeping

 The role and extent of post-cold War plays can be seen under the following points- nato apane is vistaar se main europe main ek pramukh pratinidhi ke rup main ubhara
 NATO represents the integration of the whole of Europe in the post-cold War period, which represented the integration of Western Europe during the Cold War period
 nato ke vistaar ke paksh main jo sakaraatmak bate kahi gai iske baavjood uski aalochana bhi kii jaati he
 In fact, nato's role violates the role of the United Nations in relation to peacekeeping, mutual cooperation, etc
 samajhane kii baat yah he ki sanyukt raashtra sangh kii sthapana ek antarrashtriya sanstha ke rup main kii gai, jiskaa uddeshy vishwa shanti he jabaki nato kii sthapana ek kshetreey sanghathan ke rup main kii gai

 mcdonald Hindi and Urdu are the two major languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent
 vartmaan samay main hindi mukhyatah devanagari lipi main likhi jati he jabaki urdu mukhyatah nastaliq main
 The common vocabulary of the two is also similar to a large extent, in particular contexts there is an excess of Sanskrit words in Hindi while Persian and Arabic words in Urdu
 bahut se log yah maanate hai ki nambhed, lipibhed or shailibhed ke alaava donon ek hi bhashaa hai, alag-alag nahin
 Famous critic Ram Vilas Sharma is of the opinion that the more we go backwards in history, the less the distinction between Hindi and Urdu is seen
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki hindi or urdu ke vyakaran samaan hai, unke sarvnaam or kriyaapad ek hi he
 It does not happen in two different languages
 hindi or bangla ke vyakaran bhinn-bhinn hai
 Modern literature has been composed in Khadi Boli
 khadi boli hindi main arabi-farsi ke mail se jo bhashaa bani vah 'urdu' kahalaai
 Muslims have used 'urdu' in the sense of Cantonment, Shahi Lashkar and Fort
 in sthanon main boli janevaali vyaavhaarik bhashaa 'urdu kii jabaan' hui
 For the first time, the language that the common Muslims of Delhi used to speak was Hindi
 chaudaavin sadi main mohammad tughlaq jab apni rajdhani dilli se devgiri le gaya tab vahaan janevaale pachhaanh ke musalmaan apni saamaanya bolchaal kii bhashaa bhi apane saath lete gaye
 Usually in the fifteenth century Bijapur, Golconda etc
 Muslim states had the reputation of this language at the level of literature

 This Aryan language of North India was written in Persian script among the Dravidian languages like Telugu etc
 in South India

 Initially Dakhini was very close to the colloquial dialect

 The verses were also mostly Hindi
 par solahavin sadi se sufiyon or bijapur, golkunda aadi rajyon ke darbariyon dwaara dakhini main arabi farsi kaa prachlan dhire-dhire badhane laga
 Yet till the beginning of the eighteenth century, its form remained predominantly Hindi or Indian

 Initially, here, Vali kept his poetic language, which was close to the Indian environment

 The Persian influence is less common in the early decades
 dilli kii parvarti urdu par farsi shabdaawalee or videshi vaataavaran kaa gaharaa rang chadhataa gaya
 The Hindi words were searched and thrown out and replaced by the Arabic Persian words
 mughal samrajya ke patankaal main jab lakhanu urdu kaa doosraa centre hua to uskaa hindeepan or bhi satarkta se dur kiya
 Now she became very different from her native Hindi
 hindi or urdu ke ek mili jule rup ko hindustani kaha gaya he
 As a result of the diplomacy of English rulers in India, Hindi and Urdu became distant from each other
 ek kii sanskritnishthata badhati gai or duusare kaa farsipan
 There was a script saanskrithik vaataavaran kii drushti se bhi donon kaa parthaky badhata gaya
 In such a situation, the English gave the name Hindustani to a mixed language which does not use difficult words of Arabic, Persian or Sanskrit and which is intuitive for the common people
 aage chalakar desh ke rajanyikon ne bhi is tarah kii bhashaa ko manyata dene kii koshish kii or kaha ki ise farsi or nagari donon lipiyon main likhaa ja saktaa he
 But this artificial attempt ultimately failed

 Linguists consider Hindi and Urdu as one language
 hindi devanagari lipi main likhi jaati he or shabdaawalee ke str par adhikanshat: sanskrit ke shabdon kaa prayog karti he
 Urdu is written in Urdu script and Persian and Arabic languages have more influence on the level of vocabulary
 vyakaranik rup se urdu or hindi main lagbhag shat-pratishat samanta he - keval kuch vishesh kshetron main shabdaawalee ke strot main antar hota he
 Some special sounds are derived from Arabic and Persian in Urdu and similarly some special grammatical structures of Persian and Arabic are also used
 atah urdu ko hindi kii ek vishesh style mana ja saktaa he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain in his article titled "advaita of Hindi and Urdu" has given a linguistic unity of Hindi and Urdu and has also explained the reasons for separation of Hindi literature and Urdu literature
 profesar jain ke anusaar " hindi-urdu ke 'grammer' main koi antar nahin he
 Except for the genitive sign and the plural suffix
 hindi kii upbhaashaon, boliyon, vyavhaarik hindi, maanak hindi main bolaa jaataa he- 'gaalib kaa dewan'
 In typical Urdu style it will be said - 'deewane Ghalib'
 hindi main 'makaan' kaa avikari kaarak bahuvachan vaakya main 'makaan' hi bolaa jayega
 'his three houses'
 urdu main 'makaan' main 'aat' jodakar bahuvachan prayog kiya jaataa he - 'makaanaat'
 The 'houses' will be uttered by adding 's' in hindi-urdu if the causative factor is used in the plural sentence
 'makaanon ko gira do ' - yah prayog hindi main bhi hota he tathaa urdu main bhi
 Some words are used in feminine in Hindi and in masculine in Urdu
 hindi main ' taji khabaren ' tathaa urdu main 'tazaa khabaren '
 This type of difference is found in the use of many words in the dialects of 'western-hindi' and 'eastern-hindi'
 inako chhodkar hindi-urdu kaa grammer ek he
 Since their grammar is one, the hindi-urdu language is one of the reasons
 isliye bolchaal main donon main fark nahin maaloom padataa
 'literary language' has many elements other than language
 sahitya main kathanak hota he, vahaan kisi kii kisi se upama di jaati he, alkrunt style hoti he, pratik rup main varnan hota he, chand hote hai
 Each country has its own tradition of literature, the characteristics of story, story, story-lines, ornament-plan, symbol-plan, image-plan, verses-legislation
 ek bhashaa-rup se 'hindi-urdu' kii do saahitiyik sheliyaan viksit huin
 There is a genre called 'modern Hindi literature' in which Indian symbols, epithets, images, verses and words of Sanskrit and people prevalent in the people of India are used and written in Devanagari script
 'urdu' style ke adbakaaron ne arabi evam farsi-sahitya main prachlit pratikon, upmaanon, bimbon, chando kaa adhik prayog kiya
 When literature is written in accordance with or influenced by the tradition of arabic-persian style, there is a lot of use of Arabic language and words used in Persian literature in the composition, along with it in stylistic syllables and rhythm and verses
 There is also a difference, due to which the land and the sky of the composition are seen changing
 yadi kathanak ramayana yaa mahabharat par aadhaarit hote hai to 'rachana-vaataavaran' ek prakaar kaa hota he, yadi kathanak 'laila-mazanoon', 'usuf-julekha', 'shiri-farhaad' kii kathaon par aadhaarit hote hai to 'rachana-vaataavaran' duusare prakaar kaa hota he

 Flowers, or flowers, are the reproductive structures found in plants
 ye kaha jaataa he
 Along with the reproductive components of flowering plants, flowers have been appreciated and used by humans, especially to decorate their environment and as a source of food
 paraag ko protsaahit karne ke liye pratyak pushp kii apni vishesh prakaar kii sanrachana hoti he
 Killistogamous flowers are self-pollinated, after which they may or may not open
 Many types of Viola and Salvi species have these types of flowers
 keetpremi phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se dusre ko paraag sthanantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai
 Generally, many parts of the flowers have a gland called pollen that attracts these insects
 kuch phulon main sanrachanaayen hote hai jinhen madhuras nirdesh kehete hai jo ki paragan karne waalon ko bataate hai ki madhu kahan dhoondhna he
 Flowers also attract pollinators with fragrance and color
 phir bhi kuch phool paragakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye nakal yaa anukaran karte hai
 For example, some orchid species create flowers that match the color, shape and scent of the female bee
 phool roopon main bhi visheshgy hote hai or punkatior kii aisi vyavastha hoti he ki yah sunishchit ho jaataa he ki paraag ke daanen paragak par sthanantarit ho jaayen jab vah apane aakarshith vaastu par utarataa he kai phulon kii ek hi prajati ke is aakarshneey vastu ko paane ke liye, paragak un sabhi phulon main paraag ko streekashar main sthanantarit kar detaa he jo kii bilkul sateek rup se samaan rup main vyavasthit hote hai
 Vataparagit flowers use air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, Ambergia rag hay and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators because of which they do not tend to be "showy flowers"
 Male and female reproductive organs are usually found in separate flowers, male flowers have long stamens fibers that are open at the end, and female fruits have long, wing-like pistils
 jahaan ki kitprageeya phulon ke paraag bade or lasalase daanon ki pravriti liye hue rahete hai jo ki protein main dhani hote hai, vaataparagit phulon ke paraag zyaadaatar chote dane liye hue rahete hai, bahut halke or kiton ke liye itane poshak bhi nahi
 Flowers are bicellular, which create two types of holes
 paraag or bijand kaa nirmaan alag-alag angon main hota he, par ek vishisht phool baisporingiet strobilus dhaaran kiye hue rahata he jisame donon ang hote hai The flower is called a modified stem, with small internodes and bearings, its nodes are structured into what may be highly modified leaves
 sankshep main, ek phool kii sanrachana ek sanshodhit tane par ek agr maristem par hoti he, jo kii lagaataar badhate nahin rahata phool kuch tareekon se paudhe se jude rahete hai
 If the flowers are not attached to the stem and are formed at the addresses, they are called avrita
 When the flower is flowered, it is called a flowering flower
 yadi phuleey pushpan phulon ke samoohon main khatm hota he, to prayek taana jo phool ko grahan kiye rahata he use pedicel kehete hai
 The flowering stem creates an end form called a flower chair or its letter
 The flower parts are arranged in a whorl above the letter
 vorl ke chaar mukhya bhaag is prakaar hai: Although the floral structure described above may be considered an 'ideal' structural scheme, the plant species show a wide variation of variation from this scheme
 ye badlaav phool-paudhon ke vikaas main bahut myne rakhte hai or vanaspatijna iskaa gahan prayog paudhon kii nasl ke sambandhon ko sthapit karne ke liye karte hai
 For example, two subfamilies of flowering plants can be distinguished by the inflated limbs of each of their whorls: a dicotyledon whorl ideally has four or five limbs, and monocotellidons have coefficients of three or three
 ek samuhik strikesar main keval do carpel ho sakate hai, yaa phir upar die gaye monocot or dikot ke samanyikaran se sambandhit na hon
 Most breeds of individual flowers, as described above, have both jayang and stamens
 vanaspatijna in phulon kaa varnan purna, ubhaylangeey, harmafrodit ke rup main karte hai
 Yet in some plant breeds, the flowers are incomplete or unisexual: holding only stamens or pistil organs
 In the first case if a particular plant which is either female or male is considered a diocesius 
 lekin agar ek lingeey purush yaa maadaa phool ek hi paudhe par dikhte hai to aise nasl ko monoisius kaha jaataa he
 Additional discussion on the change of flowers from the original plan is mentioned in the articles containing the original parts of the flowers
 un prajatiyon main jahaan ek hi shikhar par ek se zyada phool hote hai jise tathakthith rup se sayukt phul bhi kaha jaataa hai-aise phulon ke sangrah ko inflorosense bhi kaha jaataa he, is shabd ko phulon kii tane par ek vishisht vyavastha ko lekar bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Attention should be practiced in this regard as to what a "flower" is
 udahaaran ke liye vanaspatishaastra kii shabdaawalee main ek daiji yaa suryamukhi ek phool nahin he par ek phool sheersh he-ek pushpan jo ki kai chote phulon ko dhaaran kiye hue rahete hai iname se prayek phool kaa varnan shaareerik rup main vaise hi honge jaisaa ki inkaa varnan upar kiya ja chukaa he
 In many flowers, the element is coincident, if the outer part is divisible at any point from the central peak, two matching halves are created - they are called fixed or homogeneous
 udaa gulab yaa treelium
 jab phool vibhajit hote hai or keval ek rekha kaa nirmaan karte hai jo ki avyav sanyong kaa nirmaan karte hai aise phulon ko aniyamit yaa jaigomorfic udaa snapadragon / majus yaa zyaadaatar orkids
 a flower formula is a way that the structure of a flower is represented by a special letter, number, or symbol
 bajaay ek vishesh prajati ke, ek saamaanya formule kaa istemaal ek paudhe ke parivaar ke phuleey sanrachana ko ingit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The following representations are used
 Ca = bahyadalpunj Ca5 = dalpunj = pankhudiyaan kuch teen ke gunank main)or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; or cenbiespi; z yadi jode jaigomorfic a = punkesar g = jayang x: representing "variable number" ∞: representing many pushp sutara kuch is prakaar se dikhaai degaa: Many additional symbols are used phool kaa praathmik uddeshy prajnan he phool prajnan ang hote hai jo ki shukranuon ko paraag se bijand / andkosh se jodne main madhyastata karte hai, saamaanya rup se ek paudhe se dusre ko, par kai paudhe swayan ke phulon ko paraagit kar sakate hai
 Fertile farms produce seeds which are further ancestral

 However criticism of Hindi blogs started in the year 2007, when Ravindra Prabhat started a new experiment in blogging and pioneered to introduce readers to the precious pearls scattered in the blog world by 'blog analysis'

 Punitiveness The simple meaning of this word is - the obligation to get punishment for the "crime" committed
 aparaadh karanevaala vyakti saamanyat: apradhi kehalaata he arthath vah jo kanoon dwaara amaanya kaam kare athwa kanoon dwaara nirdhaarit anivaary kaam kii avhelnaa kare evam apane kaam yaa isaki avhelnaa se samaaj ko kshati pahunchaave
 Often a crime causes harm to a particular person and for this he can seek compensation in civil court, but in terms of social peace and discipline, there are many people for whom punishing the court by bringing criminal against the criminal
 Is the duty of samaaj main shanti kaayam rakhana shashan kaa hi daayitv he
 If every person takes vengeance for the crime committed against him by his opponent, then chaos will spread in the society and ultimately civilized life will be lost
 is kaaran rajya kii ore se hi aparaadhiyon ke viruddh gurutar dandabhiyog ke maamle laae jate hai evam aparaadh se saakshaat trast vyakti keval sakshi athwa nimitt maatr rah jaataa he
 The symbol of society is considered to be the one in which sovereign power is enshrined
 bhinn-bhinn deshon main aise sattadhari vyaktiyon ke bhinn bhinn naam hote hai
 Like, King in England, President in India
 dandabhiyog ke maamle main pratham paksh main inhen ke naam hote hai, yadhyapi aterni jeneral athwa director ov public prosecution bhi shashan kii ore se pratham paksh main ho sakate hai
 There is a fundamental difference in the cases of impeachment and title that the goal of the conviction is to punish the guilty, in the case of the plaintiff, the object of the plaintiff is to obtain property or to declare a personal right
 dandabhiyog ke liye bhinn bhinn rup main dand die ja sakate hai
 Such as, death, life-long deportation, imprisonment, protest, whipping, forfeiture, the coronation of the property of the offender, etc
 kabhi kabhi dand ke saath saath apradhi ko anarhata naagarik adhikaron kii haani evam raajnneetik adhikaron kaa apharan bhi sahanaa padataa he
 No one can be punished for an offense if he has not directly or indirectly done any work which is invalid by law or has not committed error in any mandatory work prescribed by law
 saadhaarant: kisi aparaadh kii purnataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vah doshapurn man se kiya jaay
 But only if the offender is voluntary can his work be considered a crime
 swechha se kiya hua kaam yaa kaam kii avhelnaa vah he, jise karne yaa na karne kii ichha rahi ho
 Therefore, if a person has committed a crime in an unconscious state, ie, on being sleepy, due to being in a very low state, inertia or insanity, it would be presumed that his brain was not working in such a situation
 falat: us kaam ke karne yaa uski avhelnaa main uski ichha nahin thi
 There is a difference between purpose and goal
 maamla chalaanevaala kisi dandabhiyog ke uddeshy par pramaan de saktaa he, yadhyapi aisa karne ko vah baadhya nahin he
 In cases where innocence of will may be introduced in defense, innocence of purpose is not defense
 kanoon se amaanya kaam kii marjana is aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati ki vah achche uddeshy se kiya gaya he
 Therefore, where an indictment of publication of obscene subject has been brought and the publication is indeed obscene, it will not be accepted in defense of the accused that his motive was good
 angareji vidhaan main nishchaayak prakalpana he ki aath saal kii avasthaa se kam kaa shishu aparaadh nahin kar saktaa
 In Indian law it is limited to seven years
 yadi koi balak, jisaki avasthaa 8-14 saal ke bich he, koi aparaadh kare, jisamen dusht ichha aavashyak he, to kanoon kii prakalpana ke anusaar yah mana jaayga ki use yah samajhane kii kshamta nahin he ki vah aparaadh kar rahaa he
 Therefore, it will be a charge on the person conducting the case that the said child had the ability to understand the crime
 kanoon kii ek nishchaayak prakalpana he ki 14 saal se kam se balak ko sambhog kaa gyaan nahin hota
 Hence, he cannot be punished for an attack with the goal of raping
 is vishay par sakshya bhi nahin diya ja saktaa ki 14 saal se kam avasthaa kaa balak shaareerik vikaas ke kaaran sambhog kriya main sakasham he
 But if he helps a person above the age of 14 years in sexual intercourse, it will happen
 14 saal se kam avasthaa kaa koi balak kisi bhi sthiti main aprakritik aparaadh main sahyogi nahin mana jaayga
 Everyone above the age of 14 years has sufficient knowledge in terms of law
 at: vah apane aparaadh ke liye doshi mana jaayga
 Where it is certified that the person who committed the crime was unable to understand the fruits of the crime committed due to being in a bad mental state at the time of committing the crime, then he shall not be liable for the crime nor shall he be called the offender
 
 aparaadh karne ke samay koi vyakti veikshipt tha yaa nahin, yah tathy kaa vishay he, kanoon kaa nahin
 The accused is charged with insanity
 visheshgy kaa sakshya anivaary nahin he
 It is also not necessary to give evidence by the Witnesses of immunity
 maamla chalaane vaale ke sakshiyon kii pratipruchha se pramanbhaar kaa daayitv nibhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Merely saying that a crime was committed without purpose does not prove insanity
 aise maamalon main juri kii sanmati hoti he "apradhi kintu veikshipt" 
 The culprit is kept in jail for the duration of King Kinwa President's will
 apradhi doshasiddh yaa dandaspt nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Therefore, he does not have the right to appeal
 is prasang main naitik veikshiptata asambaddha he
 That is, if it is said that the criminality of the criminal was right at the time of the crime, but his moral thinking has been erased or he has committed the crime despite being possessed by the incompressible flow of the brain, then his crime will not be excusable
 saadhaarant: koi vyakti, jo swechha se nashe kaa seven kar matt ho jaataa he, aparaadh ke daayitv se mukt nahin ho saktaa, kyonki matt yaa matvaala vyakti bhi aparaadh ke lakshya ko samajhane kii kshamta rakhata he
 But when intoxication or prominence has reached the point that it has caused temporary insanity, the defense of the accused will be similar to the insanity caused by other reasons
 jis aparaadh main lakshya aavashyak he, vahaan madasakti par sakshya dekar anyaanya sakshya ke saath yah dekha ja saktaa he ki aparaadh main lakshya bana yaa nahin
 But the evidence of insanity is not generally applicable
 yadi koi vyakti shaareerik peedan kaa bhay dikhalaae jane par baadhya hokar kisi ke aadesh ke anusaar koi aparaadh kare, jo anyathaa swechha se kiye jane par dandabhiyog hota, to vah dandabhiyog ke daayitv se mukt he
 But the person who compels him to commit the crime is guilty
 par yah bachaav tabhi maanya ho saktaa he, jab praan jane kaa tatkshan bhay ho
 If a person commits a crime by being influenced by moral force, it will not be excusable
 yadi koi apane se upar ke adhikari kii ajna paalan karne ko baadhya he evam ukt adhikari kii ajna kaa paalan karte hue, koi aparaadh kar daalata he, to uskaa aparaadh kshamya nahin hoga, yadhyapi vidwesh kii bhaavana kaa abhiyog usapar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 The king cannot be punished because he is incapable of committing a crime in the eyes of the law
 bhinn bhinn rashtron ke bich parsparik sauhaard banaae rakhane ke abhipraay se ek desh ke raja yaa uske rajdoot par anyaay deshon main dandabhiyog ke maamle nahin laae ja sakate
 The members of the Parliament are within the rules of impeachment, but they cannot be accused for their speech given in the House

 Dr
 Mata Prasad has described them as residents of Varanasi, but from Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma to Ramanika Gupta, they consider them residents of Patna
 inaki likhi hui ekmaatr kavita 'achhut kii shikaayat' uplabdh he
 This poem was published in 'saraswati' edited by Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi
 kavi-sameekshak madan kashyap ke anusaar "haalanki, saraswati main prakashit hona hi is baat kaa subut he ki is kavita ko us samay bhi mahatv diya gaya tha
 Nevertheless, the Hindi world did not receive the news of the discovery of Heera Dome in time
 anyathaa unki kuch or rachanaaen, unke bare main kuch or suchanaaen-- hamaare saamne hotin
 " hira dom tathaa unki kavita 'achhut kii shikaayat' ko prakaashan ke lambe samay baad vyapak hindi sansar main charchit karne kaa shrey dow0 ramvilas sharma ko he
 "in his book 'mahavir Prasad Dwivedi and Hindi Navajagaran' published in 1977, Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma quoted this poem
 uske baad hi isaki ore logon kaa dhyaan gaya
 " dow0 sharma ne is kavita kaa parichay dete hue likhaa tha ki "sitambar 1914 kii saraswati main patna ke hira dom kii kavita 'achhut kii shikaayat' prakashit hui
 It is in Bhojpuri and it is probably the only poem written in that language which was published in Dwivedi's Saraswati
 yah kavita unke paas bheji gai thi kyonki kavita ke upar koshthkon main chapa he-- 'praapt'
 i did not see any poem written by dom-bandhu in Hindi before
 " After further quoting the entire poem, Dr
 Sharma comments that "heera Dome must have heard Saraswati's name from someone
 maithilisharan gupt kii tarah saraswati main kavita prakashit karake prasiddh kavi banane kaa swapn to unhone na dekha hoga par apni shikaayat saraswati ke madhyam se shikshitjanon tak unhen jarur pahunchaani thi
 Dwivedi ji boldly published that poem in his magazine, in which great people yearned to get the works published
 " This poem is distinguished as the first Dalit poem
 isamen nihit gahari vaicharikta iskaa rachanaatmak vaishishty he
 According to the well-known Dalit litterateur Sharankumar Limbale, "it can be called the first composition of the current stream of Dalit thought as it not only recorded the grievances or grievances of Dalits but also expressed resentment and protest
" " According to Madan Kashyap, "it is clear from reading this poem that it is an expression of compassion, not strength, of the suffering person night and day and the title of 'untouchable Complaint' is definitely given to the editor or any other person
 
 anyathaa iskaa sheershak 'achhut kii hunkaar' hona chahie tha
 " dow0 ramvilas sharma ke anusaar: According to Madan Kashyap: 1678 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of 1678 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the birth of Jesus
