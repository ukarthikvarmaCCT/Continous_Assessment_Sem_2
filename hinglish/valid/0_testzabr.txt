 When Dwadashi came close to breaking the fast, Durwasa came to Ambareesh's house
 Ambareesh thanked Durvasa
 ambarish ne unhone bhojan karne ke liye aagrah kiya
 Durvasa accepted Ambarish's request and said that he did not break the fast till he came after bathing with the river
 a lot of time passed, but Durvasa did not come
 Ambareesh was supposed to break the fast
 guru varisht ke aagrah par ambarish ne tulsi ke dal se upwas todaa or rishi kii pratiksha karne lage
 durvasa ko laga kii ambarish ne unke aaye bina vrath todakar unka apmaan kiya
 Angry Durvasa created a demon from his jata and asked him to kill Ambareesh
 At the same time, Sudarshan Chakra of Lord Narayana killed the demon and protected Ambareesh
 After this Sudarshan Chakra started following Durvasa
 Fearing Katar Durvasa first went to Brahma and then to Shiva for his protection
 donon ne durvasa ko bachaane main apni asamarthta jataai or kaha ki wo ambarish se kshamaa maange
 durvasa ne aisa hi kiya
 Ambareesh remembered Lord Vishnu and prayed to protect Durvasa from him
 Although the story is slightly different in the Shiva Purana
 shiv puraana ke anusaar, ambarish ne durvasa ko bhojan karaane se pehle vrath todkar durvasa kaa apmaan kiya
 Hence Durvasa decides to kill Ambareesh
 ambarish ko bachaane ke liye sudarshan chakra utpann hua
 But he stopped when he found Shiva in the form of Durvasa
 usee samay akashwani hui
 nandi ne kaha, ki ambarish kii pariksha lene swayan shiv aae hai isliye vah unase maafee maang le
 ambarish ne aisa hi kiya or durvasa ne use aashirwad diya

 See an example- vidyapati kii kavita shringaar or vilaas kii vastu he, upasna evam sadhana unka uddeshy nahi he
 Radha and Krishna love each other as ordinary men
 swayan vidyapati ne apni rachana kirtipataakaa main likhaa he- sita kii virah vednaa sahan karne ke kaaran ram ko kaam-kala-chatur anek striyon ke saath rahane kii vednaa utkar ichha unhone krishnavatar lekar gopiyon ke saath vibhinn prakaar se kamkreedaa kii
 Therefore, it is clear that Krishna and Radha were the heroes and heroines of Shringar Ras in the eyes of the poet himself
 vidyapati ne nari kaa nakh-sikh varnan apni kavita main kiya he, tathaa multah shringaar ras kaa prayog kiya hai
 This makes it clear that he had a mental attitude
 atah unase bhakt jaise kavy-vyavhaar kii apeksha karnakadachid ek tarah kaa unase anyaay hi he
 He is influenced by the creator Jaydev of Geetagovind
 gitgovind main shringaar ras kaa bharpoor prayog hua he, tathaa jo chitra jayadev ne shri krishna kaa gitgovind main prastut kiya he thik vaisaa hi charitrankan vidyapati ne padaavalee main kiya he
 It is clear that the picture that Jayadev and Vidyapati have presented in their compositions is completely different from that of Sri Krishna, the founder of the Mahabharata
 mahabharat main radha jahaan shrikrishna kii prerak shakti ke rup main dikhaai deteen hai, vahiin padaavalee main vidyapati ne krishna kii uddaam kamvasanaon se prerit radha kaa rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 From what is mentioned in the phrase, no one can consider them as devout poets, because the devout poet cannot dare to worship his adoration in such a manner
 visheshkar, duti evam sakhi-shiksha-prasang main jo radhakrishna kaa amaryadit rup prastut kiya gaya he vah keval koi shringaari kavi hi kar saktaa he, bhakt kavi nahin
 See a description of excessive makeup from Vidyapati's phrase- kuch aalochak unhen bhakt bhi maanate hai
 Some scholars are of the opinion that the philosophy of Raganugabhakti is in their footsteps according to the Dvaitadvaita doctrine propounded by Nimbarka and in their posts, descriptions of Radhakrishna's pastimes should be seen from the perspective of devotion
 dow grearsan bhi isi mat kii hi tarah likhte hai- vidyapati ke pad lagbhag sab ke sab vaishnav pad yaa bhajan he or sabhi hindu bina kisi kaam-bhaavana kaa anubhav kiye vidyapati kii padaavalee ke padon kaa gungan karte hai
 Shri Nagendra Nath Gupta has described the posts of Vidyapati with pure spirituality while rendering him a devotee
 dow janardan mishra ne vidyapati kii padaavalee ko aadhyatmik vichaar tathaa darshanik good rahasyon se paripurna mana
 According to Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, Maithil Kokil Vidyapati is the first poet of Vaishnav literature in Hindi
 unki rachanaaen radha or krishna ke pavitra prem se otpot hai
 Some critics say that Vidyapati has composed the phrase as Vaishnava literature
 kavi gitgovindam kii bhaanti unki padaavalee main radha-krishna kii premamayi murti kii jhaanki drushtigochar hoti he
 He has worshiped his beloved in social form
 is drushtikon se unhone vidyapati ke un padon ko uddhrut kiya he jo vidyapati ne radha, krishna, ganesh, shiv aadi kii vandana ke liye likhe hai
 See a verse related to Radha's prayer yahi nahin, unhone prarthana evam nar-nari ke prasang main bhi anek devidevataaon, radhakrishna, durga, shiv, vishnu, surya aadi kii vandana kii he
 There are also some critics who consider them devout poets on the basis of their prayer-related positions, irrespective of Vidyapati's cherished positions
 yah satya he ki un ke kuch bhakthi parak pad hai parantu shringaar parak rachana adhik he yahaan tak ki bhakthi parak padon main bhi shringaar kaa atishay varnan kiya gaya he
 It is clear from many verses of Vidyapati that Vidyapati was not really a Vaishnavite, only according to the tradition he worshiped Ganesha etc
 at the beginning of the book
 unke padon ko bhi do bhaagon main baant sakate hai
 1-related to Radhakrishna 2 related to Shivgauri
 radha krishna sambandhi padon main bhakthi-bhaavana kii udaattata evam gambheertha kaa abhaav hai tathaa in padon main vaasana kii gandh saaf dikhaai detii he
 It is impossible to find righteousness, philosophicalism or spirituality
 shiv-gauri sambandhi padon main vaasana kaa rang nahin he tathaa inhen bhakthi kii koti main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 10 radha krishna vishyak padon main vidyapati ne loukik prem kaa hi varnan kiya he
 Radha and Krishna seem to love each other like ordinary women and the amount of devotion is negligible
 is tarah kaha ja saktaa he ki vidyapati shringaari kavi hai unke padon main maadhurya pag pag par dekha ja saktaa hai
 He has not used Radhakrishna's names for worship but has introduced himself as an ordinary hero and Vidyapati's goal is to portray adornment in the phrase
 kavi ke kavy kaa mul sthaayee bhav shringaar hi he
 While in the royalty, he did only the adorned works to the delight of the king, no doubt
 11 iske atirikt vidyapati ke samay main bhakthi kii tulana main shringaarik rachana kaa mahatv adhik tha
 Jaidev's compositions like Geetgovind are of this category

 Thus, due to division, mutual discord and discrimination among the Hindus of Sindh, they eventually converted
