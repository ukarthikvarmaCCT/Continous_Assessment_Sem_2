 unhen nabhikeey bhautikee kaa janak mana jaataa he
 Ernest Rutherford was born on 30 August 1871 in New Zealand
 apni adhiktam umr rasinic prayogon main gujaarne vaale vaigyanik maaikel farade ke baad duusare sthaan par arnest radarford kaa hi naam aata he
 Due to his qualifications in physics, in 1894 Rutherford got a chance to do research under the famous physicist Sir JJ Thomson, for which he got a scholarship
 1898 main canada ke macgil vishvavidhyalay main ve bhautikee ke professor rahe or 1907 main england mancastor vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee ke vyaakhyaata
 After Thomson's death in 1919, Ernest Rutherford became Professor and Director of Physics at Cambridge University
 bhautik rasayan ke lagbhag sabhi prayogon main upyog hone vaali alpha, beta or gamma kirnon ke bich antar bataane vaale vaigyanik arnest radarford hi the
 He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his contributions to nuclear physics
 arnest radarford ke parmaanu sanrachana ke siddhant se pehle padaarthon main parmaanu kii upasthiti kaa pataa to chal sakaa tha, kintu parmaanu ke bare main jo jaankaree thi use aage gati di arnest radarford ke kiye prayongon ne
 Years ago, Maharishi Kanad had told that every substance is made up of very small particles
 1808 main britain ke bhautik vigyaani jon dalton ne apane prayogon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki padaarth jin avibhajya kanon se milakar bana he unhen parmaanu kehete hai
 Independent existence of these atoms is possible
 dalton ke baad vaigyanik thomson va radarford ke prayogon ne dalton ke siddhant main sudhaar kiya unhone spasht kar diya ki parmaanu avibhajya nahin he balki yah chote−chote aaweshit kanon se milakar bana he
 In 1897, Sir Thomson proved the presence of a positively charged particle inside the atom
 us samay tak parmaanu ke andar upasthit dhanaveshit kanon ke liye kaha gaya tha ki ye kan parmaanu ke andar bikhri hui avasthaa main thik usee rahete hai jaise bundi ke laddu main ilaychi ke dane athwa water mailan ke andar uske beej yaa christmas pudding main dry fruits
 Ernest Rutherford's scientific mind was not satisfied with such an interpretation of the electron inside the atom, he carried out many more experiments to the satisfaction
 parmaanu ke andar kii ko sanrachana jaanane ke liye 1911 main unhone ek prayog kiya jisamen unhone nirvaat main screen ke saamne rakhi ek patali swarna panni main se kuch alpha kirnon ko guzaara
 The results of the experiment were surprising
 parmaanu ke bare main ab tak prachlit siddhanth ke anusaar alpha kanon ko gold foil ke paar screen par ek hi jagah jaakar takaraana chahie tha, kintu radarford ne dekha ki kuch alpha kan gold foil se takaraakar bhinn−bhinn konon par vichlit hokar waapas aa rahe the or kuch uske paar bhi nikal rahe the
 Rutherford's experiment made it clear that there is some dense positive part between the atoms from which the alpha particles were returning
 prayog se unhone siddh kiya ki yah dhanatmak ghanaa bhaag parmaanu kaa 'nabhik' he, is nabhik main hi parmaanu kaa samast dravyaman kendrit rahata he evam electron isi dhanatmak aavesh ke chaaron or vyavasthit rup se ghoomte hai

 According to a study conducted in 2008, the total water availability in the country was 654 billion cubic meters and the then total demand was 634 billion cubic meters
 
 Also, it has been clarified in several studies that in the near future, the difference between demand and supply may take worrisome form if the distribution on regional basis is also included and the problem will increase

 The plateau parts of India have always been weak in terms of ground water
 yahan bhoojal kuch khaas bhugarbhik sanrachanaon main paaya jaataa he jaise bhransh ghaatiyon or daraaron ke sahare
 The alluvial plains of northern India have always been rich in ground water, but now an unprecedented reduction has been recorded in the northern western parts due to rapid exploitation of irrigation
 bharat main jalparon or bhoojal kii sthiti par chintaa jaahir kii ja rahi he
 The way ground water is being exploited in India, the future conditions can be quite dangerous

 It is important to note that ground water is the source of 60% irrigation and water and about 85% of drinking water in India, in such a situation the fast falling level of ground water is emerging as a big challenge

 The distinction between language and dialect is determined by "mutual intelligibility"

 Complete intelligibility indicates a similar eloquence of individuals living in a dialect area

 But this inequality is not so gross that they cannot understand each other

 Similarly language is the coordinated unit of dialects
 uparyukt dharna se yah spasht he ki vyakti boli or bhashaa ke bich bodhgamyata ke hi vividh str sakriy hote hai
 Language studies are mostly considered up to the level of sub-language but individual dialects are also important in terms of dialect
 bhashiya str par vyaktiboli evam upboli kaa ek yugma hota he or boli tathaa bhashaa kaa doosraa
 Just as it is easy to understand each other in the language and border areas of languages or languages, even though they are distinguishable, the same or even more comprehensibility lies at the boundaries of dialect or sub-language
 simavarti kshetron main pai janevaali aisi bodhgamyata ke kaaran hi bhashaa or boli yaa boli yaa upboli ke bich koi spasht vibhaajak rekha nahin khinchi ja sakati
 Bloomfield has called the study of local distinctions in a linguistic field a dialect of geography and also complements the achievements of the comparative genre
 boliyon ke adhyayan ko boli atlas ke rup main prastut karnaa sarvaadhik prachlit he
 These atlas of the dialect region are collections of maps on which linguistic features are represented through homogeneous lines based on local distribution
