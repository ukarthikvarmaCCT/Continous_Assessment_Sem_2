 According to the condition, the king has to leave his kingdom
 raaj paat chhodkar wo pashchim disha kii ore nikal padate hai

 vah chah baar harata he
 Now he has nothing left to lose

 par manjari kii maa use bhejne se manaa kar detii he
 Manjari's mother sends a message to Raja that when Manjari gets married, killing her husband and taking him to Manjari
 raja ye baat maan lete hai
 Manjari also becomes a young man on seeing this
 phir mata pita ko uski shaadi kii chintaa sataane lagati he
 Manjari knows who her groom is
 wo koun he jo shaadi ke baad raja ko haraa sakegaa
 Manjari tells her parents that you go to a place called Ballia
 vahaan loric naam kaa ek noujvaan milegaa
 He is related to my births and he will also be able to beat the king
 manjari ke pita loric ke ghar jate hai or donon kaa rishta tay ho jaataa he
 Lorik goes to marry Manjari with one and a half lakh baraatis
 son nadi ke is kinare aata he lekin raja apane sainikon ke saath usase ladane pahunch jate hai

 manjari ek asaadhaaran ladki he
 She goes to Lorik
 usase kahati he ki agori ke is kile ke paas hi gothaani naam kaa ek gaanv he
 There is a temple of Lord Shiva
 tum jaao bhagwaan kii upasna karo
 You will win in this war
 loric jeetta he
 They both get married
 manjari kii vidaai ho jaati he
 But before leaving the village threshold, she asks Lorik to do something that the people here remember that Lorik and Manjari once loved to this extent
 loric kahata he ki bataao aisa kya karun jo hamaare pyaar kii to nishaani bane hi, pyaar karne vaala koi bhi joda yahaan se maayoos nahin laute
 Manjari showed Lorik a stone and asked him to cut it with a single sword
 loric ne aisa hi kiya
 But a new problem occurred
 pathar to do tukdon main ho gaya
 But a part of it fell down the mountain
 manjari ne kaha ki pathar ko aise kaato ki uske donon hisse ek hi jagah par khadey rahen
 Lorik did the same
 or ye pathar jamaane se yaheen khadey hai

 Slang or slang are informal words and phrases of a language or dialect that are not considered standard in the speaker's language or dialect but are acceptable in colloquialisms
 bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki kathboliyaan har maanak bhashaa main hameshaa astitv main rahi hai or lagbhag sabhi log unka prayog karte hai
 Often different classes of the same language community have their own different slang and the use of slang by a person is a sign of membership in a particular class
 udhaaharan ke liye dilli ke hindi bolne vaale pulisavaale ko kathboli main 'thulla' kehete hai jabaki mumbai main use 'mamaa' kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes slang can remain prevalent for a long time without being a part of the standard language, for example in some sections of the society in the form of slang the word 'thulla' for Sho or Durga in some communities in the Punjab region in 1880 Was found to be prevalent
 kathboliyaan aksar preyokti ke rup main bhi istemaal hoti hai jab kisi chiz ke liye maanak shabd sunne main apriy yaa apmanjanak samajha jaae, masalan 'mutr' ko kai hindibhashi kathboli main 'susu' kehete hai
 Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a word is part or slang of the standard language
 bhashavaigyanik bethani dumaas or jonethan liter ne kisi shabd yaa vaakyansh ke kathboli hone ke kuch chihnon kii suchi banaai ki agar koi shabd inamen se kam-se-kam do lakshan rakhata ho to shaayad kathboli he : Slang is different from a specialist dialect spoken in a commercial field
 vargboli kisi vishesh peshey kii takneekee shabdaawalee hoti he or uske shabd upar di gai suchi main se keval duusare maandand ko puraa karte hai, isliye kathboli nahin kahe ja sakate haalanki unka prayog peshey se baahar vaale ko samooh se alag rakhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Some slang is used only in a particular area, for example in Fijian Hindi, 'what' is sometimes called 'konchi', a contracted form of 'who cheese'
 iske vipareet kathboli sangyaayen kshetra kii bajaae aksar kisi vishesh up-samskruti jaise ki sangeet yaa video khelon se judi hoti hai
 Nevertheless, slang expressions can go beyond their realms and be generally usable like "cool" and "jive"
 jabaki kuch shabd antat kathboli ke rup main apni sthiti ko kho dete hai, anya shabdon ke prayog ko zyaadaatar vaktaaon dwaara isi tarah mana jaataa rahaa
 When slang goes beyond the group or subculture that originally used it, its actual users tend to use other, less-recognized terms to retain the identity of the group
 kathboli kaa ek upyog saamaajik nishedhon ko darkinar karnaa he kyonki mukhyadhara kii bhashaa kuch vaastaviktaaon ko tarotaaja karne se dur bhaagane kii koshish karti he
 For this reason, slang terminology is particularly rich in certain areas such as violence, crime, drugs, and sex
 vaikalpik rup se kathboli varnan kii gayi chizon ke saath keval maatr apanepan se baahar nikal sakati he
 For example, among the gifts of Californian wine, Cabernet Sauvignon is often referred to as "cab saw", cardone as "card" and so on; This means that naming individual alcohols reduces its unnecessary use; It also helps to show the user's familiarity with alcohol
 yahan tak ki ek bhashaa vaale samudaay main bhi kathboli or jis had tak iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he, yah sampurna saamaajik, jaateey, aarthik or bhugolic kshetra main vyapak rup se bhinn ho jaataa he
 Slang can be out of use after a long time; However, sometimes its use becomes more and more common until it becomes an effective way of saying something, when it is generally understood as the accepted language of the mainstream, although the case of prohibitive words There may not be any expression that is considered mainstream or acceptable language
 kathboli ke kai shabd anaupchaarik mukhyadhara ke samvaad main or kabhi-kabhi aupchaarik samvaad main pravesh kar jate hai, haalanki isse arth yaa upyog main ek badlaav bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Slang often involves the creation of novel meanings for existing words
 un aupnyasik arthon kaa maanak arth se kaaphi had tak alag ho janaa ek aam baat he
 Thus both 'cool' and 'hot' can mean "very good," "impressive," or "beautiful"
 kathboli ke shabdon ko aksar keval ek gut yaa antah samooh ke andar istemaal ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Leats for example were originally popular only among certain Internet subcultures such as crackers and online video gamers
 haalanki 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan or 21veen sadi kii shuruyaat main lit ne internet par adhik se adhik aam sthaan lenaa shuru kar diya he or ab yah internet aadhaarit samvaad or baatcheet kii bhashaaon ke baahar bhi fail gaya he
 Other types of slang include the language of SMS used on mobile phones and "chatspeak," which is a reverse meaning of "laughing loudly" or "loud laughter" or ROFL, "rolling on the ground laughing" ), Which is widely used to send instant communication over the Internet
 kuch bhashavid kathboli ke prayog or khichdi bhashaa ke prayog ke bich ek antar rakhte hai
 According to Ghilad Zuckerman "slang refers to a specific social group, for example informal textual materials used by teenagers, soldiers, prisoners, and thieves
" kathboli bolchaal kii bhashaa kii tarah nahin he jo kisi avasar par vaktaa dwaara istemaal kii jane vaali ek anaupchaarik, aasaan boli he; jisamen shabdasancoch shaamil ho sakate hai jaise ki "tumhaara" or anya bolchaal ke shabdon kaa prayog
 aam bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa prayog anaupchaarik boli main istemaal kii jane vaali ek shabdic saamagree he jabaki vyapak arthon main "bolchaal kii bhashaa" shabdaawalee main kathboli kaa prayog shaamil ho saktaa he, iske sankeern arthon main nahin
 Slang is often used in colloquial language but not all colloquial languages are slang
 kathboli or bolchaal kii bhashaa ke bich karne kaa ek tarika yah poochna he ki kya zyaadaatar sthaneey vaktaa is shabd ko samajhate hai ; agar ve aisa karte hai to yah ek bolchaal kii bhashaa he
 The problem, however, is that it is not a separate, quantization system but a continuum system
 haalanki zyaadaatar kathboliyaan alpakaalik hoti hai or aksar nae logon dwaara prayog kii jaati hai jinamein se kuch gaiyr-kathboli vaali bolchaal kii bhashaa kii sthiti hasil kar leti hai 'anand, bhagya' or ek yahudee mahila kaa pehla naam, zelda) or yahan tak ki ek aupchaarik sthiti "
 Slang is called 'slang' in many languages
 The roots of this word are not yet known to linguists

 Born on 27 December 1937 in the village of Bhawanipur in Aurangabad district of Bihar, the famous freedom fighter, litterateur and member of Bihar Legislative Council late Kamataprasad Singh, the child's parents took the name of his adorable god Shankar as Prasad, and named it Shankar Dayal
 Which became Shankar Dayal Singh by coincidence with the word caste
 choti umr main hi mata kaa saaya sir se uth gaya at: daadi ne unka paalan poshan kiya
 After graduating from Banaras Hindu University and a postgraduate degree from Patna University, he became a member of the All India Congress Committee in 1966 and was elected an MP in 1971

 The journey of Shankar Dayal Singh, started as the director of Samachar Bharati, also toured India and abroad, crossing many steps like Parliamentary Official Language Committee, Delhi Public Library, Indian Railway Consultative Committee, Translation Council of India, Central Hindi Advisory Committee
 She continued to enjoy herself and continued to enhance her blood by laughtering her fellow travelers

 If his journey continued even after 27 December 1995, he would have celebrated his 58th birthday on the same occasion for which he was known among his friends
 unki ek visheshta yah bhi rahi ki unhone jivan paryant bhartiya jivan mulyon kii raksha ke saath-saath bhartiya samskruti kaa poshan kiya bhale hi iske liye unhen kai baar ulajhna bhi pada kintu apane vishisht vyavhaar ke kaaran ve un tamaam vaadhaon par ek aparaajey yoddha kii tarah vijay pate rahe
 Shankar Dayal Singh was a member of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, but since he was originally a litterateur, he would not like to get into politics and often used to take umbrellas of literature to avoid its scorching sun
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki ve apane lekhon main un sabaki bakhiya udhed kar rakh dete the jo unke shuddh ant:karan ko niti viruddh lagate the
 Like the government's sense of neutrality towards the village revival, he used to keep his voice in the discussions of Parliament, he also wrote articles in various magazines and magazines which were read by the anti-party happy and the ruling-party, which he himself used to be an MP
 He was unhappy
 dekha jaye to raajnneeti main, aaj jahaan prayek party ne keval chatukaaron kii chandal-chaukadi kaa majamaa jamaa kar rakkha he jiske kaaran raajnneeti ke talab main svachh jal kii jagah keechad hi keechad najar aa rahi he; vahaan ke pradooshit vaataavaran main shankaradayal singh sareekhe camel kii kami vastav main khalati he
 He wrote about 25 articles about political upheavals, which not only made the headlines of the then news, but are also available in libraries in book form
 jivan ko dhoop-chaanv kaa khel maanane vaale shankar dayaal singh kaa yah maananaa ek dam sahi tha ki jis prakaar prakruti apana santulan apane aap kar leti he usee prakaar raajnneeti main kaam karne vaale prayek vyakti ko sahityakar hona pehali yogyata kaa maapdand hona chaiye
 He often used to give the example of all the veteran political figures before him and told that all those great people were litterateurs first, later politicians or anything; Due to which there was constant balance in their life and they could never cheat the country
 aaj jise dekho vahi raajnneeti ko vyavsaay kii tarah samajhataa he seva kii tarah nahin; yahi kaaran he ki sarvatra ashaanti kaa samrajya he
 The situation is that nowadays in the sun of politics, the feet of the leaders are less, more scorching of the public
 unheen ke shabdon main - "maine swayan raajnneeti se aasav grahan kar uski masti sahitya main bikheri he
 Experience from there, experience from here
 maran vahaan se varan kiya jivan yahan se
 Whenever scorching in the sun, ran towards this place for the shade
 lekin yah sahi he ki dhoop-chaanv kaa anand letaa rahaa, aankh-michauni kheltaa rahaa
 " bharatvarsh ko swatantrata ke pashchaat yadi koi ek niti ekajute rakh sakati thi to vah keval ek bhashaagat rashtriya-niti hi rakh sakati thi kintu hamaare desh ke karnadhaaron ne is ore koi vishesh dhyaan nahin diya apitu ek ke bajaay anek bhashaaon ke bhanvar-jaal main uljhaakar dub marane ke liye vivash kar diya he
 When the Indian freedom struggle or the war of our freedom was fought through one language Hindi, no prefecture-language speaker in this country had any hindrance to learn their language first and only then they would unite and support you otherwise
 is tarah yadi karte to kya kabhi 1947 main hindustan aaazaad ho saktaa tha? kadaapi nahin
 The national language can be only one or it cannot be many
 yadi raashtra-bhashaayen ek ke sthaan par 15 yaa 20 kar di jaayengi to nishchit maaniye prantiyata kaa bhav prayek ke man main paidaa hoga or uskaa dushprinaam yah hoga ki yah raashtra vikhandan kii ore agrasar hoga, ekta kii ore nahin
 Since Shankar Dayal Singh was also a Member of Parliament and his standing in Parliamentary Affairs Committees remained equal, he also got the pleasure of traveling to various countries and places with the help of government resources
 parantu unhone vah sukh akele na uthaakar apane saahitiyik mitron ko bhi uplabdh karaayaa tathaa lekhon ke madhyam se apane pathakon ko bhi pahunchaaya
 After reading the accounts of important visits from Moscow to Suriname and Trinidad, the capital of the Soviet Union, we do not feel that Shankar Dayal Singh is not among us
 apitu kabhi-kabhi to aisa abhas-sa hota he jaise vah hamaare ird-gird ghoomte hue lattu kii bhanti gatiman is bhumandal ke chakkar abhi bhi laga rahe hai
 His first-hand experience in the book Politics of Dhoop: Sahitya Ki Chhaon, published in 1992 from Parijat Prakashan, Patna, is very interesting

 Following this mention, the list of published books of Shankar Dayal Singh is given as follows: rashtrabhasha hindi ke liye shankar dayaal singh ne aaajeevan aagrah bhi kiya, yuddh bhi lada or yada-kada aahat bhi hue
 Despite all this, he was awarded the Anantagopal Shevade Hindi Award for Hindi service in 1993 and the Gadgil National Award in 1995, but he was never completely satisfied mentally
 nissandeh shankar dayaal singh puraskaar yaa sammaan paakar apni bolti band rakhane waalon kii shrenee ke vyakti nahin, apitu or adhik prakharata se mukhar hone waalon kii shrenee ke vyakti the
 This was the reason why the Central Government, as an eminent writer, may not have given any award or honor, for which he was actually an officer; But he received many awards from many institutions, organizations and state governments from all over India

 Kachwaha considers himself a descendant of Kush, the eldest son of Ayodhya King Ramachandra
 karnal taad ne rajputon ke itihaas main likhaa he ki kush ke vanshaj hone se inkaa naam pehle kushvaha or iske baad kushwaha ho gaya
 In some Sanskrit inscriptions of the Kachhwaha kings of Gwalior and Narwar, they have been written as Kachchagara or Kachhapari

 Kachhayari in Prakrit and then in normal colloquy became a tortoise yon kisi pracheen lekh main inako kushvaha nahin likhaa gaya
 In verse 71 of the Adi festival of Mahabharata, there is a description of war by Kshatriyas by Nagavanshi Kachhap caste

 It is said that after leaving Ayodhya, the ancestors of these tortoises settled in Rohtasgarh and then went to Narwar

 However, the Gopalpura jagir was established in 1574 by Alamrao, the younger son of Raja Roop Pal Singh of Lahar, a princely state of the Kachhwaha dynasty
 angrejon dwaara is riyasat se kisi prakaar kaa tex nahin liya jaataa tha
 Ranpat Rao, Parashurama, Kharagrao, Champatrao, Harrah Rao, Harvansh Rao, Trilok Singh, Jitwar Singh, Laxman Singh, Ramchandra, Lochan Singh, Sudarshan Singh, Udayveer Singh, and Krishnapal Singh were the principal kings of this princely state

 Bappa Rawal Bappa or Bapa is not actually a proper word, but just as the word "bapu" has become stereotyped for Mahatma Gandhi, similarly the word "bapa" has been used for an anthropomorphism of Mewar
 sitaudiya vanshi raja kalbhoj kaa hi doosraa naam bapa maanane main kuch aitihaasik asangati nahin hoti
 Due to its work of preservation, patriotism, etc
, the people had probably honored it with Bapa title

 When the camera is placed in a specific location to take a shot or photograph from a film camera or a video camera, it is called a camera angle
 ek shot, ek saath, ek samay par kai angles se liya ja saktaa he
 This can lead to different experiences or sometimes different feelings
 har camera angel se darshakon par ek alag prabhaav paidaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, there are some other ways that the camera operator can create such effects
 vishay vaastu ko dhyaan main rakhte hue camera kahan rakhaa hua he is baat se bhi darshako ke vishay ko dekhne ke nazariye par asar padataa he
 There are several types of camera angles, such as: high-angle shot, low-angle shot, birds-eye view, and worm-eye view
 ek spasht duri or angel jisase camera main dikhaai detaa he athwa record kiya jaataa he use vupoint kehte hai
 Eye-level shots and point-of-view shots are also types of some camera angles
 hai-angel shot wo hota he jisame camera vishay vaastu se upar rakhaa hua ho or use niche jhuk ke dekh rahaa ho
 The high-angle shot makes the subject Vastu look small, weak and vulnerable, and the low-angle shot makes the subject Vastu look upside down, where the camera is placed below the subject Vastu, making the subject Vastu powerful or threatening
 neutral shot yaa oy-level shot kaa darshakon par koi bhi maansik prabhaav nahin hota he, is shot main camera vishay vaastu kii barabari main rakhaa hota he bilkul uski sidh main
 When the viewer is shown eye sight of the subject Vastu then it is called point of view shot
 kabhi kabhi point of vyuu shot lene ke liye camera ko haathon main pakadaa jaataa he jisase kii darshakon ke liye ye bhram paidaa kiya ja sake kii ye nazaaraa vishay vaastu ke aankhon se dekha ja rahaa he
 Birds eye shot or birds eye view, shots are taken from above the scene to set the landscape
 jab darshako ko yah mahasoos karana ho ke ve paatr ko kaaphi neeche se dekh rahe hai tab use varm oy vyuu kaha jaataa he, ye aksar chote bachche yaa kisi paaltu jaanavar ke vyuu ko dikhne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 While choosing these camera angles, it should be kept in mind that each angle has a different effect, so they should be used keeping in mind the context of the scene or film
 shots ke vibhin prakaar hote hai jo kii in angles ke istemaal se kaam main laaye ja sakate hai
 Like Extreme Long Shot which is recorded from far away of the subject Vastu and sometimes even the subject is not visible in it
 extream long shot zyaadaatar hai angel se liya jaataa he, taaki darshako neech seen kii sadi stithi dekh saken
 Extreme long shot is mostly used in the beginning of any scene, especially to establish it or to describe the scene of the scene descriptively to the audience
 vaise zyaadaatar shots aamator par oy-level yaa point of vyuu shot hote hai, haalaanki kisi bhi shot ko kisi bhi angel se lenaa sambhav he
 Subject Vastu is shown in long-shot, but the setting of the shot is such that the picture frame dominates the subject Vastu
 medium-shot main donon yani ke vishay vaastu or settings kaa baraabar mahatv hota he or donon hi frem main 50 / 50 hote hai
 Apart from this, when the medium-shot is focused or focused only on the character, then the character is shown above the waist, then it is mid-shot
 medium close-up shot wo hota he jisame paatr ko chaati se upar tak dikhaaya gaya ho
 In a close-up, the entire frame is filled with a particular feature or part of the subject, such as if only one character's face is shown in one frame
 or aakhir main extream close-up shot, isamen keval paatr ke kisi ek shaareerik hisse ne puraa frem ghar hua hota he, jaise kii ankhen, haath yaa koi or hissaa
 All these shots can be used with any of the aforementioned camera angles
 dach angel jise kii kanted angel yaa tiltid angel bhi kaha jaataa he, yah wo angel he jisame camera khud daayin yaa baayin ore jhukaa hua hota he
 This unnatural angle makes the audience feel as if the world has gone out of balance or creates a state of mental turmoil
 production or post-production ke dauraan har camera angel ko ek anuthi aksharankeey pahchaan diya janaa zaruri he, 
 As a quote "scene 24C
" The letters in camera angles are often spoken of as NATO phonetic alphabet or Older police-style radio alphabet, such as the quote "scene 24 Charlie
" Some letters are not used because they look like digits when writing letters, such as "S" as a quote that looks like the number "5" in English
 vrutra pracheen vaidic dharm main ek asur tha jo ek sarp yaa andaha bhi tha
 Vritra in Sanskrit means 'to cover'
 iskaa ek anya naam 'ahi' bhi tha jiskaa arth 'saanp' hota he or jo avastai bhashaa main 'azi' or 'adi' ke roopon main miltaa he
 The Vrittra in the Vedas is such an azhadaha that creates a drought by blocking the way of rivers and which is slaughtered by Indra
 kuch varnanon main iske teen sar darshaae gaye hai
 One day Sri Ramachandraji called Bharata and Lakshmana to him and said, "O brothers, i wish to perform the Rajasuya Yajna as it is the culmination of Rajdharma
 is yajna se samast paap nasht ho jate hai tathaa akshay or avinashi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Therefore, both of you should think and say that will this sacrifice be good for the welfare of this world and hereafter? " bade bhai ke ye vachan sunakar dharmatma bharat bole, "maharaj! is prithvi par sarvottam dharm, yash or swayan yah prithvi aap hi main pratishthit he
 You, the whole earth and all the kings who live on it, consider you as Pitrulya
 atah aap aisa yajna kis prakaar kar sakate hai jisase is prithvi ke sab rajwanshon or veeron kaa hamaare dwaara sanhaar hone kii ashanka ho?" Shriram was very pleased to hear the said words of Bharata and said, "bharata! Your Satyaparampa is virtuous and protect the earth
 tumhaara yah uttam kathan sweekaar kar main rajasuya yajna karne kii ichha tyaag detaa hoon
 " tatpashchaat lakshmana bole, "he raghunandan! sab paapon ko nasht karne vaala to ashwamegh yajna bhi he
 If you want to perform a yajna then do this yagna
 mahatma indra ke vishay main yah pracheen vrutant sunne main aata he ki jab indra ko brahmahatya lagi thi, tab ve ashwamegh yajna karke hi pavitra huye the
 " shri ram dwaara puri katha poochne par lakshmana bole, "prachinkaal main vritrasur naamak asur prithvi par purna dharmik nishtha se rajya karata tha
 Once, he handed over the kingdom to his eldest son Madhureshwar and went into the forest to perform rigorous penance
 uski tapasya se indra kaa bhi asana hill gaya
 He went to Lord Vishnu and said that God! With the help of penance, Vritrasura has accumulated so much power that i can no longer rule him
 yadi usne tapasya ke falswaroop kuch shakti or badha lee to ham sab devataaon ko sadaa uske aadhin rahanaa padegaa
 That's why God Please save the whole world from his suzerainty
 kisi bhi prakaar uskaa vadh kijiye
 "upon hearing this prayer of Devraj Indra, Lord Vishnu said that you know this Devraj! i have love for Vritrasura
 isaliye main uskaa vadh nahin kar saktaa parantu tumhaari prarthana bhi main asweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 That is why i will divide my glory into three parts in such a way that you can kill Vritrasura yourself
 mere tej kaa ek bhaag tumhaare andar pravesh karegaa, doosraa tumhaare vajra main or teesraa prithvi main taaki vah vritrasur ke dharashayi hone par uskaa bhaar sahan kar sake
 After receiving this boon from God, Indra along with the gods went to the forest where Vritra was doing penance
 avasar paakar indra ne apane shaktishaalee vajra vritrasur ke mastak par de maaraa
 Due to this, the head of the circle was cut off and separated
 sir katate hi indra sochane lage, maine ek nirparaadh vyakti kii hatya karke baari paap kiya he
 Thinking this, they started going to some dark place to make atonement
 indra ke lop ho jane par devataaon ne vishnu bhagwaan se prarthana kii ki he dinabandhu! vritrasur maaraa to aapke tej se gaya he, parantu brahmahatya kaa paap indra ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 That is why you should provide a solution for their salvation
 yah sunakar vishnu bole ki yadi indra ashwamegh yajna karke mujh yajyapurush kii aradhana karenge to ve nishpaap hokar devendra pad ko praapt kar lenge
 Indra did the same and with the brilliance of the Ashwamegh Yajna, he got rid of brahmacharya
 " There is a story of Vritrasura, which has been returned by the foolish people that they have gone against both evidence and tactics
 'twashta ke putr vritrasur ne devon ke raja indra ko nigal liya
 Then all the gods came near Vishnu with great fear, and Vishnu gave a solution to kill him that - i will enter the ocean
 tum log, us phen ko uthaakar vritrasur ke maarna, vah mar jaayegaa
 ' yah paaglon kii si banaai hui puranagranthon kii katha sab mithyaa he
 It is appropriate for the best people to never accept them
 dekho satyagranthon main yah katha is prakaar likhi he ki -- Here the name of Sun is Indra
 uske kiye hue parakramon ko ham log kehete hai, joki param aishwarya hone kaa hetu bada tejadhari he
 He kills 'vritra' i
e
 cloud with his rays
 jab vah marake prithvi main gir padataa he, tab apane jalarup sharir ko sab prithvi main failaa detaa he
 Then several big-2 rivers are filled with it and go into the sea
 kisi ve nadi hai ki parvat or meghon se utpann hoke jal hi bahane ke liye hoti hai
 When Indra Meghroop kills Vritrasura from the sky and falls into the earth, then he falls asleep in the earth
 
 1
 
 Then the same cloud falls down from the sky and takes shelter of the mountain, that is, the cloud
 jisko sury apni kirnon se phir hanan karata he
 Like when someone peels the wood
 vaise hi vah megh ko bhi bindu-bindu karke prithvi main gira detaa he or uske sharirroop jal simat-simat kar nadiyon ke dwaara samudr ko aise praapt hote hai, ki jaise apane bachhadon se gaay daud ke milti hai
 
 2
 
 jab sury us atyant garjit megh ko chhin-bhinn karke prithvi main aise gira detaa he ki jaise koi manushya aadi ke sharir ko kaat kaat kar giraata he, tab vah vritrasur bhi prithvi par mritak ke samaan shayan karne vaala ho jaataa he
 
 3
 
 'nighantu' main megh kaa naam vrutra he--vrutra kaa shatru arthath nivarak sury he,sury kaa naam twashta he, uskaa santan megh he, kyonki sury kii kirnon ke dwaara jal kan hokar upar ko jaakar vaahan milke megh rup ho jaataa he
 And the vrittra name of the cloud is because Vrithrovrnote: 0 He is acceptable and he is the covering of light
 vrutra ke is jalarup sharir se badi-badi nadiyaan utpann hoke agaadh samudr main jaakar milti hai, or jitna jal talab va coop aadi main rah jaataa he vah maano prithvi main shayan kar rahaa he
 
 5
 
 vah vrutra apane bijli or garjanrup bhay se bhi indra ko kabhi jeet nahin saktaa
 In this way, both Indra and Vritra do the same thing as a war of words, that is, when the cloud increases, it removes the light of the Sun, and when the temperature of the Sun increases, it removes the cloud named Vritra
 is
 parantu is yuddh ke ant main indra naam sury hi kii vijay hoti he
 When the cloud rises and spreads wide in the earth and the sky, then it falls into the earth after killing the sun
 uske pashchaat vah ashuddh bhoomi, sade huye vanaspati, kashtha, trin tathaa malamutradi yukt hone se kahin-kahin durgandh rup bhi ho jaataa he
 Then the sea water starts to look terrible
 is prakaar baarambaar megh varshata rahata he
 Ie, water rises in the sky from all places
 vahaan ikattha hokar phir se varsha kiya karata he
 Many substances etc
 are produced from the same water and the earth's shade
 usee megh ko 'vritrasur' ke naam se bolte hai
 The names of Vayu and Surya are Indra
 vaayu akaash main or sury prakashasthan main sthit he
 It is the battle of these Vritrasura and Indra in the sky that at the end of which the defeat of the cloud and victory of the sun is undoubtedly

 Among the edited texts, Hindi Shabdasagar, Nagari Pracharini Patrika, Bhramargeet Sar, Sur, Tulsi Jayasi Granthwali are notable
 shukla ji ne praayah saahitiyik or manovaigyanik niabandh likhe hai
 3 parts of literary essays can be done - saiddhanthik aalochanatmak niabandh- 'kavita kya he'
 Essays such as 'sanskritism of Lok Mangal in poetry', 'generalization and individualism', etc
 come under theoretical criticism
 aalochana ke saath-saath anveshan or gaveshna karne kii pravriti bhi shukla ji main paryaapt maatra main he
 'history of Hindi literature' is the result of this trend
 vyavhaarik aalochanatmak niabandh- bhaaratendu harishchandra, tulsi kaa bhakthi maarg, maanas kii dharm bhoomi aadi niabandh vyaavhaarik aalochana ke antargat aate hai
 Psychological Essay- Psychological essays include essays written on emotions and psyche, such as compassion, reverence, devotion, shame, guilt, anger, greed, love
 shukla ji ke ye manovaigyanik niabandh sarvatha moulik hai
 Like him, no other writer has written so maturely on the above subjects

 He was a firm supporter of Lokadarsha
 is samarthan kii chhap unki rachanaaon main sarvatra milti he
 The language of the prose-literature of Shukla ji is standing and it often has two forms - shukla ji kaa donon prakaar kii bhashaa par purna adhikaar tha
 He is extremely careful, refined, mature and grammatically innocent
 usamen ranchamaatr bhi shithilataa nahin
 The words are interwoven into the formula of sentences like pearls
 ek bhi shabd nirarthak nahin, prayek shabd kaa apana purna mahatv he
 Shukla ji's style is fully marked by her personality
 yahi kaaran he ki prayek vaakya pukaar kar kah detaa he ki vah unka he
 In general, Shukla ji's style is very mature and original
 usamen gaagar main sagar purna rup se vidyaman he

 Shukla ji is perhaps the first critic of Hindi who made a genuine effort to interview the deep and broad goals of secret poetry in the fabric of diverse life
 unhone 'bhav yaa ras' ko kavy kii aatma mana he
 But in his view, the ultimate goal of poetry is not the joy but the reputation of Lokmangal by the sophistication, diffusion and harmony of various expressions
 unki drushti se mahan kavy vah he jisase jivan kii kriyasheeltaa ujagar hui ho
 He has called this the locality of folklore in poetry
 shukla ji kii samast moulik vichaarna lokajeevan ke moort aadarshon se patibaddh he
 'our heart is directly attached to the transverse forms of nature', therefore, the first and necessary work of the poet is to do 'bimbagrahan' or 'chitranubhav'
 purna wimbgrahan ke liye varnya vastu kii 'paristhiti' kaa chithran bhi apekshit hota he
 In this way Shukla ji emphasizes the overall realization of life through poetry
 jivan main or kavy main kisi tarah kii ekangita unhen abhisht nahin
 Shukla Ji's installations are not as scriptural as the original
 unhone apni lokbhaavna or manovaigyanik drushti se kavyashastra kaa sanskaar kiya
 With this view, they fall into Acharya category
 kavy main lokmagal kii bhaavana shukla ji kii samiksha kii shakti bhi he or seemaa bhi
 His power lies in poignant research into the practical and broader meanings of poetic life
 par unki aalochana kaa purvanishchit naitik centre unki saahitiyik mulyachetana ko kai avasaron par simit bhi kar detaa he unki manovaigyanik drushti aalochay kavi kii manogati kii pahchaan main adwitiya he
 Shukla ji presented a high paradigm of practical criticism by the reviews of Jayasi, Sur and Tulsi
 inamen shukla ji kii kavyamrmagrata, jivanvivek, vidvatta or vishleshankshmata kaa asaadhaaran pramaan miltaa he
 They have the unique ability to identify poetic sensations, their transparent analysis and convey them to the reader through accurate language
 inke hindi sahitya ke itihaas kii samikshaon main bhi ye visheshtaayen spasht hai
 Shukla ji's psychotic essays are the result of Prajna
 inamen bhaavon kaa manovaigyanik rup spasht kiya gaya he tathaa maanav jivan main unki aavashyaktaa, mulya or mahatv kaa nirdhaaran hua he
 According to the sentiments, the behavior of man changes - in this view Shukla ji researched his social economy consciously
 unhone manovikaron ke nishedh kaa upadesh denevaalon par jabardast akraman kiya or manovegon ke parishkar par jor diya
 These essays help readers to understand themselves and others in practical terms and make them realize social responsibility and dignity
 samaaj kaa sanghathan or unnayan karanevaale aadarshon main aasthaa in rachanaaon kaa mul swar he
 By associating the emotions with the familiar situations of life, they are also authentic representations in terms of poetry
 apane sarvottam rup main shukla ji kaa vivechanaatmak gadhy paardarshee he
 He has an unusual ability to articulate deep thoughts in a coherent manner

 As the above-mentioned quadrant shows, these people have come many times to say that whatever groom you want to ask, ask for it; But Manu Satarupa had to ask for Parambrahma himself as a son, then how could he ask for a boon from Shankar, Brahma and Vishnu? Our Lord Shri Ram is omniscient

 jeevon ke sharir bahut choti-choti kashikaaon se bane hai
 Take the simplest one-cell organism
 koshika kii rasinic sanrachana ham jaanate hai
 Cells are made up of proteins and the nucleus inside them contains nuclear acid
 ye protein keval 20 prakaar ke amino amla kii shrinkhalaa-krambaddhata se banate hai or is prakaar 20 amino amla se tarah-tarah ke protein sanyojit hote hai
 American and Russian scientists have proved by experiment that amino acids can be produced by electrocution by closing methane, ammonia and oxygen inside a hollow glass pan
 unhone kahana prarambh kiya ki atyant pracheen kaal main jeevaiheen prithvi par methane, ammonia tathaa oxigen se bhare vaataavaran main badalon ke bich bijli kii gadgadaahat se amino amla bane, jinase protein yojit hue
 The Sun has been called the giver of life in its ancient texts
 isise prerit hokar bharat main prayog hue ki jab pani par surya kaa prakaash formaldihide kii upasthiti main padataa he to amino amla banate hai
 It acts as a formaldehyde catalyst
 iske liye kisi vishesh prakaar ke vayumandal main vidyutiya prakshepan kii aavashyaktaa nahin
 Now the nucleic acid of the cell? a tamarind tree will be produced from tamarind seeds, the child of an animal will become an animal, it is a hallucination of nuclear acid
 yahi nabhikeey amla jin ke nabhik ko banaata he, jisase sharir evam mastishk kii rachana tathaa vanshanukram main praapt honevaale gun—sabhi puraani peedi se nai peedi ko praapt hote hai
 When a cell divides into two cells in the course of reproduction, both cells will be like parent cells, this is due to nuclear acid
 paanch prakaar ke nabhikeey amla ko lekar seedhi kii tarah anu sanrachana se jitne prakaar ke nabhikeey amla chahen, bana sakate hai
 Nuclear acid has inherent properties that it divides itself under proper conditions to make two identical properties of independent existence
 duusare yah ki kis prakaar kaa protein bane, yah bhi nabhikeey amla nirdhaarit karata he
 The secret of the magic of making many creatures of the same type lies in this
 kya kisi duurastha grah ke devataaon ne, prabud jivo ne ye paanch nabhikeey amla ke mul yogic is prithvi par bo die the? There are about nine billion atoms in a cell
 kaise sambhav hua ki itane parmaanuon ne ek saath aakar ek jivit koshika kaa nirmaan kiya
 Even after the formation of different types of proteins or nuclear acids under different conditions, the question remains, under which conditions they combined and made life possible
 bharat main dow krishna bahadur ne prakaash-rasinic prakriya dwaara jeevanu banaae
 In the catalytic presence of formaldehyde, proteins and nuclear acids from the rays of the sun were combined into a unicellular bacterium
 ye jeevanu apane liye poshak aahaar andar lekar, use pachaakar or koshika kaa bhaag banaakar badhate hai
 In biology, we call this process of self-cultivation as metabolism
 ye jeevanu andar se badhate hai, rasayanashala main ghol ke andar tange hue sundar kantimay ravaa kii bhanti baahar se nahin
 Bacteria grow from one to two, that is, reproduction
 or aise jeevanu keval carbon ke hi nahin, tanba, silicon aadi se bhi nirmit kiye, jinamein jivan ke uparyukt gun the
 It is said that there is a consciousness inside the organism
 vah chaitanya kya he? yadi angulii main sui chubhi to angulii turant peeche khinchati he, bahya uddipan ke samaksh jhukati he
 Suppose there is a balanced system
 usamen ek bahari baadha ai to ek ichha, ek chaah utpann hui ki baadha dur ho
 There is also a change in the balanced system to some extent to solve it
 yadi yahi chaitanya he to yah manushya evam jantuon main he hi
 Some would say, it is also in the flora, plants and plants
 par ek parmaanu kii sochen—usamen hai nabhik ke chaaron ore ghoomte vidyut kan
 When an external obstacle comes in the form of a shadow of a nearby field of power, this molecule brings some changes inside itself and sometimes even if it is partially, it resolves it
 bahari dabaav ko kisi seemaa tak nishprabh karne kii ichha evam kshamta—aakhir yahi to chaitanya he
 This Chaitanya is omnipresent
 maharishi arvind ke shabdon main, ‘charachar ke jeev or jad, sabhi main nihit yahi sarvyaapee chaitanya he
 ' par jivan jadta se bhinn he, aaj yah antar spasht dikhataa he
 All organisms digest and take energy from the body by digesting food from outside, ie, making them part of the body
 jad vastuon main is prakaar andar se badhane kii prakriya nahin dikhti
 Then roughly all organisms produce other organisms of their own kind
 niraa ek- koshik sookshmdarsheey jeev bhi; jaise amoeba badhane ke baad do yaa anek apane hi tarah ke ek-koshik jeevon main bant jaataa he
 Sometimes the organism attains maturity through several stages and then reproduction takes place again
 kisi-na-kisi rup main prajnan jivan kii vritti he, maano jeev-sristi isi ke liye ho
 But both these properties are also in bacteria
 yadi yahi vrittimulak paribhaasha jivan kii len to jeevanu uski praathmik kadi he
 Why did these circles arise in the cell? The answer lies in the treaty of philosophy, physics and chemistry where biology begins
 yahaan sabhi vigyaan dhundle hokar ek-duusare main milte hai, maanon sab ekaakaar hon
 There are two basic Indian concepts for this — it is a mere quality that it has a tendency to recur in its durable unit
 purush sookt ne punrariti ko sristi kaa niyam kaha he
 There is an adaptability in every living system; The obstacles that come in partial can be resolved, by making themselves adaptable to the situation
 in gunon kaa ek doorgaami parinaam jeev kii vikaas-yatra he
 Chaitanya is omnipresent and the organism and root is present in all, this pure Indian philosophy was incomparable to the communists
 uparyukt donon bharaty abhidharanaon ne, jo jeevanu kaa vyavhaar evam jeev kii vikaas-yatra kaa kaaran bataati hai, unhen jhakzor daalaa
 It has been believed in many civilizations that God created creation
 bhartiya darshan main ishwar kii anek kalpanaagan hai
 Understanding that all those fantasies belong to the creator God will not be right
 ishwar ke vishwaas ke saath jise anishvaravaadi darshan kah sakate hai, yahan panapata rahaa
 Kanad Rishi said that all this creation is made up of atoms
 sankhya darshan ko bhi ek drushti se anishvaravaadi darshan kah sakate hai
 Sankhya believes that male and nature are two separate elements and creation of the universe happened by the combination of both
 purush niskriy he or prakruti chanchal; vah maaya he or haav-bhav badalati rahati he
 But this world without man, it cannot be a gracious creation
 upama di gai ki purush surya he to prakruti chandramaa, arthath usee ke tej se prakashwan
 a friend of mine used to use a metaphor to explain this difference
 unhone kaha ki unke bachapan main bijli na thi or gas lamp, jiske prakaash main sabha ho sake, anivaary tha
 But the gas lamp was inactive
 na vah tali bajaata tha, na vaah-vaah karata tha, na kaarywahi main bhaag letaa tha, na prerana de saktaa tha or na paraamarsh
 But even if you want to be beaten up in the meeting, a gas lamp was needed, so that your supporters should not be beaten in the dark
 yah gas lamp yaa prakaash sankhya darshan kaa ‘purush’ he
 He is passive, does nothing
 par uske bina sabha bhi to nahin ho sakati thi
 Similarly, the five Upanishads in the famous nine Upanishads, in the sense in which the Bible glorified God the Creator, can be called atheistic in that sense
 jo granth ishwar ko srishtikarta ke rup main maanate hai unamem ek prasiddh vaakya aata he, ‘ekjhhan bahusyaami’
 The desire arose in the mind of God that i am one, to be many and that is why i made many of my own experiences - i put such meaning in it
 par ek se anek banane kaa to jeev kaa gun he
 Not only this, it is also a natural tendency of mere matter
 bhartiya darshan ke anusaar yah sristi kisi kii rachana nahin he, jaisaa ki isai yaa muslim vishwaas he
 If God created this universe, then it was God, that is, some creation
 isliye ishwar swayan hi bhautik tatv athwa padaarth tha, aisa kahana padegaa
 That is why this all-universe is only its expression or manifestation, not a creation or creation
 usee prakaar jaise aabhushan swarna kaa aakaar vishesh main prakatikaran maatr he
 In the same way, Indian philosophy saw the creation
 dharmik pravriti ke logon ko yah vichaar ki jivan is prithvi par swaabhaavik or anivaary rasinic- bhautik prakriya dwaara bina kisi chamatkaari shakti ke utpann hua, isliye pratikul padataa he ki ve jeev kaa sambandh aatma se jodate hai
 They believe that life is not possible without a soul and therefore there is a divine being in which eventually all souls merge
 par jad prakruti kaa swaabhaavik saundarya, vah sphatik, vah himalay kii barphani chotiyon par swarna-kirit rakhata surya, vah ush:kaal kii laalimaa yaa kanyakumari kaa teen mahasaagaron ke sandhi-sthal kaa suryaast, athwa jhil ke tarangit jal par khelti prakaash-rashmiyaan- ye sab keede-makodon se yaa cancer kii faphund se yaa amarbel yaa kisi kshudra jaanavar se nimna str kii hai kya? ped-paudhe or unamem uge kukuramute main aatma he kya ? ek baat jo musalmaan yaa isai nahin maanate
 Why is it good to discriminate between such living and living things in the world? shaayad ham sochen, sabhi jeevadhariyon kaa ant hota he
 'kehi Jag Kaal Na Khay' ‘ vanaspati or jantu sabhi mrityu ko praapt hote hai or unka sharir nasht ho jaataa he
 But if a unicellular organism grows up and gets divided into two or more organisms of its own type, what would this event be called as the death of the first organism? By the way, the child is also an extension of the parents' life, their sustenance enters a new body
