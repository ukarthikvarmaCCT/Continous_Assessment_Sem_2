 bhatton kii report par acroshit kendriya karmchaariyon ke gusse kaa us vakt thikaana nahin rahaa jab inaki tarif us shaksh ne kar di jiske upar unhen sabase zyada bharosa tha
 AIRG General Secretary Shiv Gopal may have praised the government on some issues, but this has led to the insinuation among the employees that they are getting the yes of the government
 kai karmchaariyon ne railvaarta se kaha ki unhone karmchaariyon kii peeth main chura ghonpa he or unka sarkaar ke saath gupt samjhauta tha isi kaaran sarkaar ne karodon rupaye unki madad se arier ke bachaa liye
 On the other hand, NFIR has criticized this report
 bhatton par kendra sarkaar ke karmchaariyon kaa gussa thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 On top of this, Shiv Gopal Mishra has praised the central government on the report and has bought the resentment of his people

 In fact, Shiv Gopal Mishra praised the government for giving 10-20-30 percent housing allowance to one to three level employees and demanded the same proportion of allowance to other Group c employees
 lekin chaalaaki dikhaane ke chakkar main vah yaheen galati kar gayi
 The government had set a minimum rate of housing allowance, not any level, did not mention any level in it
 sarkaar ne saaf kaha tha ki karmchaariyon ko 1800-3600 or 5400 se kam awaas bhatta nahin milegaa
 Now the 10-20-30 he is talking about, can he tell how much accommodation allowance will be given to the level 6 employee in the other classified city? Let us tell you that Shivagopal Mishra's claim on this issue is completely beyond facts
 level 6 main minimum vetan 35400 he
 On this, a total of Rs 2832 should be given to the employee at the rate of eight percent housing allowance, but the government has fixed the lowest rate for this, according to this the employee of this level will get Rs 3600

 Yaksha made him unconscious just like that, the four brothers, Sahadeva, Arjuna and Bhima went to take water one by one, but no one could answer the questions of Yaksha and still tried to get water Yaksha made the four brothers unconscious
 In search of the four brothers, Yudhishthira reached the banks of the pool and saw the four brothers lying unconscious
 He said that who has seduced my brothers, he came in front, The Yaksha came and he said that he wanted to take water without answering my questions, so he had this predicament, if you also behaved like this then you will also have the same condition

 ek harfanmaulaa aisa cricket khilaadi he jo niyamit taur par ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon main acha pradarshan karata he
 Although batting is essential for all bowlers and some batsmen also bowl occasionally, most players are proficient in only one of these two things and are considered experts
 kuch wicket-kiparon main visheshgy ballebaajon kii nipunata hoti he or ve bhi harfanmaulaa kahe jate hai, lekin unke liye wicket-keeper ballebaaj shabdaawalee kaa zyada istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The greatest all-rounders include George Hurst, Wilfred Rods, Mushtaq Mohammed, Keith Miller, Garfield Sobers, Andrew Flintoff, Walter Hammond, Ian Botham, Jacques Kallis, Kapil Dev, Richard Hadley, W

 G
 Grace, Chris Cairns, Shane Watson, Dwayne Bravo, Imran Khan and Shahid Afridi can be named
 vaise kisi khilaadi ke liye aisi koi sateek yogyata nahin he jiske aadhaar par use harfanmaulaa mana jaae or is naam kaa prayog vyaktiparak ho jaataa he
 It is usually called a 'real all-rounder' who has such a batting or bowling ability so that he is able to make a place in one of the teams for which he plays
 'vaastavik harfanmaulaa' kii ek or paribhaasha ye hai ki ek aisa khilaadi jo apni ballebaaji or gendbaaji se, lagaataar apane "dal ke liye match jeetne main madad kare" 
 By definition, a real all-rounder is an extremely rare and highly valuable player for a team as it effectively serves as two players
 kabhi-kabhi bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he jab ek visheshgy gendbaaj balle se acha pradarshan karata he
 For example, the great West Indian fast bowler Malcolm Marshall used to play good innings many times, but it was not so often that he was considered an all-rounder
 Instead, he can be called a good batsman of the lower order
 isi tarah ek visheshgy ballebaaj ko upyogi badlaav kaa gendbaaj kaha ja saktaa he or iske ek achche udhaaharan alan border hai jinhone 1989 main ek baar ek test match main tab 11 wicket liye, jab paristhitiyaan unke baayen haath kii phiraki gendbaaji ke anukool thim
 One of the major obstacles to becoming a recognized all-rounder is the arrival of batsmen and bowlers at different ages
 Bats reach their peak around thirty years of age when they mature with technical experience
 iske ulat tej gendbaaj aksar bees se pachchis saal ke dauraan shaareerik kshamta ke saath-saath apane shikhar par pahunch jate hai
 Other bowlers, mostly spin bowlers and fast bowlers, are also more effective towards the end of their careers
 aankadon kaa ek saamaanya par istemaal kiya jane vaala niyam yah he ki khilaadi kaa ballebaaji ausat uske gendbaaji ausat se zyada hona chahie
 In Test cricket, there are only three all-rounders whose batting average is twenty points more than their bowling average: Garfield Sobers, Jacques Kallis and Walter Hammond
 However, there are other players who achieved this feat for a large part of their careers, such as Imran Khan, Steve Waugh, Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson
 Duff Walters achieved a difference of nearly twenty runs in his batting and bowling average from batting average of 48
26 and bowling average of 29
08, despite that he was generally considered to be an occasional bowler and partnership breaker, not a real all-rounder

 There are very few who are good at both and perhaps none at all who are better at both
 yahi vajah he ki "gendbaaj harfanmaulaa" or "ballebaaj harfanmaulaa" naam saamne aae
 For example, Keith Miller had a good batting average of 36
97 in Test cricket, and an excellent bowling average of 22
97, so he is called a bowler allrounder

 This large diversity in antibodies helps the immune system recognize the types of antigens with equally large diversity
 pratipind dwaara pahachaanaa gaya pratijan kaa vishisht bhaag epitope kehalaata he
 These epitopes are joined to their antibody by a highly specialized process called inducing fit, which allows the antibody to recognize and associate only its specific antigen among the millions of different molecules responsible for anatomy
 pratipind dwaara ek pratijan kii pahchaan ise pratiraksha ) pranali ke anya bhaagon dwaara hamale ke liye chihnit karti he
 Antibodies can also neutralize targets directly, for example, by associating with part of the pathogen that can cause infection

 As a result, the surface Ig and Ig are identical except for the transmembrane regions
 isliye, ve pratipind ke do prakaaron ke rup main jane jate hai: ghulansheel prakaar yaa membren bound prakaar 
 The membrane bound type of a antibody can be called Akk॓॓ःःक्कीक्की xxwrep 2 ब् क्ष / / / / / ब् / / / / / / / / ब् / / / 2ब्ग्ग् xxwrep 10 2 xxwrep 26 ब् ोग ब्ब्स ब् इम इम इमो xxwrep 2 गो ग xxwrep 5 या या yah bi koshika receptor ) kaa ek bhaag he, jo bi koshika ko sharir main vishisht pratijan kaa pataa lagane kii anumati detaa he or bi koshika sakriyan shuru karata he
 The BCR is composed of surface-bound igd or igm and is associated with Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable of transferring signals
 ek saamaanya maanav bi koshika kii sataha se 5 xxrep 4 0 se 1 xxrep 5 0 pratipind jude hote hai
 After joining the antigen, they appear as large spots on lipid rafts that can grow more than 1 micrometer in diameter, separating the BCR from another cell indicating the receptor
 ye dhabbe celular pratiraksha pratikriya kii dakshata main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 In humans, the cell surface is bare for several thousand angstorms around the b cell receptor, which further differentiates BCR from competing effects
 pratipind vibhinn prakaaron main uplabdh hai jinhen isotip yaa varg kaha jaataa he
 Five types of antibody isotypes are found in mammalian embryos called iga, igd, ige, igg and igm

 Antibody isotypes of b cell change during cell development and activation
 aparipakv bi koshikaayen, jo kabhi bhi ek pratijan ke sampark main nahin ain, sidhi saadi bi koshikaon ke rup main jaani jaati he tathaa cell sarphase bound form main keval igm isotip ko hi vyakt karti hai
 Upon reaching maturity, b cells begin to express both igm and igd — co-expression of both immunoglobulin isotypes prepares b cells to 'mature' and react to antigens

 They have a characteristic immunoglobulin fold, in which two beta sheets form a "sandwich" shape, which are joined by interactions of the conserved cysteine and other charged amino acids
 stanadhariyon main paanch tarah kii aiji / Ig baari shrinkhlaayein pai jaati hai jinhen unani bhashaa ke aksharon: α, δ, ε, γ or μ dwaara darshaya jaataa he
 The type of heavy chain shown defines the square of the antibody; These series are found in iga, IGD, IGE, IGG, and IGM respectively
 vishisht baari shrinkhlaayein aakaar tathaa sanrachana main bhinn hoti hai; α or γ main lagbhag 450 amino amla hote hai, jabaki μ or ε main lagbhag 550 amino amla hote hai
 Each heavy chain has two regions - the stationary region and the unstable region
 The constant region is the same in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes
 baari shrinkhalaaon γ, α or δ kaa sthir kshetra teen agranukramon aiji / Ig prabhaav kshetra se bana hota he, tathaa atirikt lacheelepan ke liye hinj kshetra hota he, jabaki μ or ε baari shrinkhalaaon kaa sthir kshetra chaar immunoglobulin prabhaav kshetra se bana hota he
 The volatile region of the heavy chain differs according to the antibodies produced by different b cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single b cell or b cell clone
 prayek baari shrinkhalaa kaa asthir kshetra 110 amino amla jitna lanbaa hota he or ekal aiji / Ig prabhaav kshetra se bana hota he
 There are two types of immunoglobulin light chains in mammals called lambda and kappa

 halki shrinkhalaa kii lambaai lagbhag 211 se 217 amino amla hoti he
 Each antibody has two light chains, which are always identical; In mammals, only one type of light chain κ or λ is present in one antibody 
 duusare prakaar kii halki shrinkhlaayein jaise ki iota shrinkhalaa, nichali shrenee ke rishadhariyon jaise condrikthayis or teleostei main pai jaati hai
 Some parts of the antibody have specific functions

 The tomb of Razia Sultan, razia al-din ,shahi naam “jalolet ud-din raziow”, itihaas main jise saamanytah “razia sultan” yaa “razia sultanaa” ke naam se janaa jaataa he, dilli sultanate kii sultan thi
 Razia ruled the Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240
 vah iltutamish kii putree thi
 Razia of Turkish origin was practiced in the leadership and administration of the army like other Muslim princesses, so that it could be used when needed
 
 razia sultanaa muslim evam turki itihaas ki pehali mahila shaasha thim
 Razia was made the Sultan of Delhi after the death of his father Shams-ud-din Iltutmish
 iltutamish, pehla aisa shaasha tha, jisane apane baad kisi mahila ko uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 However, it was not acceptable for the Muslim class to inherit a woman from Iltutmish, so after his death his younger son Raknuddin Firoz Shah was placed on the throne
 raknuddin, kaa shashan bahut hi kam samay ke liye tha, iltutamish kii vidhwaa, shah turkan kaa shashan par niyantran nahin rah gaya tha
 The public outraged against the lax and reckless Raknuddin to the extent that Raknuddin and his mother, Shah Turkan, were assassinated on 9 November 1236
 uskaa shashan maatr chah maah kaa tha
 After this, in the absence of any other option for the Sultan, the Muslims had to give the reins of governance to a woman
 
 And Razia Sultan became the ruler of Delhi
 shashan kaaryon main razia kii ruchi apane pita ke shashan ke samay se hi thi
 After assuming the throne, Razia preferred to wear a soldier's coat and turban like men, unlike customs
 balki, baad main yuddh main bina nakaab pahane shaamil hui
 Razia renounced the purdah system and started wearing open clothes in the court like men wearing a cog razia apni raajnneetik samajhadaari or nitiyon se sena tathaa jansadharan kaa dhyaan rakhti thi
 She became the most powerful ruler of Delhi
 razia or uske salaahkaar, jamaat-ud-din-yakut, ek habshi ke saath viksit ho rahe antarang sambandh kii baat bhi musalamaanon ko pasand nahin ai
 Razia did not pay enough attention to it
 , kintu uskaa is sambandh ke parinaam ko kam aankna apane rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 According to some sources, Razia and Yakut were lovers; According to other sources, they were both close friends / confidants
 is sabase razia ne turki varg main apane prati ishya ko janm de diya tha, kyonki, yakub, turk nahin tha or use razia ne ashwashaala kaa adhikari niyukt kar diya tha
 The Governor of Bathinda, Mallik ikhtiar-ud-din-altunia, revolted along with the other provincial governors, who were ruled by the ruler of Razia
 razia or altuniya ke bich yuddh hua jisamen yakut maaraa gaya or razia ko bandi bana liya gaya
 Fearing death, Razia agreed to marry Altunia
 is bich, razia ke bhai, mazuddin beharam shah, ne singhaasana hathiyaa liya
 Razia and her husband, Altunia, fought Behram Shah to defeat her Sultanate, in which she was defeated
 unhen dilli chhodkar bhaagna padaa or agle din wo kaithal panhuche, jahaan unki sena ne saath chhod diya
 On 14 October 1240, both were killed in a clash with the Jats there
 baad main beharam ko bhi ayogyata ke kaaran gaddi se hatana padaa
 The tomb of Razia Sultan and her lover Yakut, the only female ruler to rule the throne of Delhi, is claimed at three different places
 razia kii majaar ko lekar itihaaskaar ek mat nahin he
 Delhi, Kaithal and Tonk have been claiming their claim on the tomb of Razia Sultana
 lekin vaastavik majaar par abhi faisla nahin ho paaya he
 By the way, these three claims are the strongest among the claims of Razia's tomb
 in sabhi sthanon par sthit majaaron par arabi farsi main razia sultan likhe hone ke sanket to mili hai lekin thos pramaan nahin mil sake hai
 Some concrete evidence of the tomb of Razia Sultan and his Ethiopian slave Yakut has been found in Tonk, Rajasthan
 yahaan puraane kabistan ke paas ek vishaal majaar mili he jisapar farsi main ’saltane hind rajiyah’ ukera gaya he
 There is also a small tomb nearby which can be Yakut's tomb
 apni bhavyata or vishalata ke aakaar par ise sultanaa kii majaar qaraar diya gaya he
 Local historian says that there was a gap of one month between Jung and Razia's death from Bahram
 itihaaskaar is ek maah ko chook vash ullekith nahin kar paae or jang ke turant baad uski maut maan lee gai
 Whereas it was not so
 jang main haar ko saamne dekh yakuut razia ko lekar raajapootaana kii taraf nikal gaya
 He wanted to save Razia's life but eventually he was surrounded in Tonk and died here
