 He was a devotee of Rama
 ve 'bapa' ke naam se prasiddh hai
 He was born in 1799 in village Veerpur in Rajkot district of Gujarat
 jalaaram bapa kaa janm san 1799 main gujarat ke rajkot jile ke virpur gaanv main hua tha
 His father's name was Pradhan Thakkar and mother's name was Rajbai

 Pleased with his service, Saint Raghuveer Das ji blessed that his second son Jalaram will become an example of God and sage-devotion and service

 But he wanted to get away from the matrimonial bond and engage in service
 jab shri jalaaram ne tirthayatraaon par nikalne kaa vishchay kiya to patni veerbai ne bhi bapa ke kaaryo main anusaran karne main vishchay dikhaaya
 At the age of 18, Jalaram Bapa accepted Shri Bhojalarama, the saint of Fatehpur as his guru

 The history of the Earth describes the most important events and fundamental stages of its development from the creation of the planet to the present 4
6 billion years ago
 prakritik vigyaan kii lagbhag sabhi shakhaon ne prithvi ke itihaas kii pramukh ghatnaon ko spasht karne main apana yogadan diya he
 The age of the Earth is about one-third of the age of the universe
 us kaal-khand ke dauraan vyapak bhugarbheey tathaa jaivik parivartan hue hai
 The first era of Earth's history, which began with the creation of the Earth by accretion from a solar-nebula about 4
54 billion years ago, is called Hedion
 yah archian yug tak jari rahaa, jisaki shuruyaat 3
8 Ga main hui
 The age of the oldest rock found on Earth has been measured to be 4
0 Ga and the oldest detrital Zurcan particles found in some rocks have been estimated to be around 4
4 Ga, which is the period around the Earth's surface and the Earth's composition itself
 Is a block chunki us kaal kii bahut adhik saamagree surakshit nahin rakhi gai he, atah hadian kaal ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree praapt he, lekin vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ki lagbhag 4
53 Ga main, praarambhik sataha ke nirmaan ke sheeghra baad, ek adhik puraatan-grah kaa puraatan-prithvi par prabhaav padaa, jisane iske aavaran va sataha ke ek bhaag ko antariksh main oochaal diya or chandramaa kaa janm hua
 During the Haydian era, there was a continuous meteorite on the surface of the Earth and volcanic eruptions would also have been fierce due to the large amount of heat flow and the geothermal ratio
 detrital zarkaan kan, jinaki aayu 4
4 Ga aanki gai he, is baat kaa pramaan prastut karte hai ki drav jal ke saath unka sampark hua tha, jise is baat kaa pramaan mana jaataa he ki us samay is grah par mahaasaagar yaa samudr pehle se hi maujuud the
 Based on the calculations of volcanic eruptions found on other celestial bodies, it has been estimated that a time-zone called meteorite mass impact, called the "late Heavy Bombardment", began around 4
1 Ga
 This ended around 3
8 Ga with the end of the Hedion
 archian yug ke prarambh tak, prithvi paryaapt rup se thandi ho chuki thi
 Due to the composition of the Archaean atmosphere, which did not have oxygen and ozone layer, it would have been impossible for most of the present fauna to exist
 iske baavjood, aisa mana jaataa he ki archian yug ke praarambhik kaal main hi praathmik jivan kii shuruyaat ho gai thi or kuch sambhavit jeevashm kii aayu lagbhag 3
5 Ga aanki gai he
 However, some researchers speculate that life might have occurred during the early Hedian period, about 4
4 Ga ago, and that they could survive their potential Late Heavy Bombardment period due to their being in hydrothermal pores below the Earth's surface
 saura mandal kaa nirmaan antartaarkeey dhul tathaa gas, jise saura niharika kaha jaataa he, ke ek ghoomte hue badal se hua, jo ki akashganga ke centre kaa chakkar laga rahaa tha
 It was composed of hydrogen and helium formed shortly after the Big Bang 13
7 Ga and heavy elements emitted by supernovas
 lagbhag 4
6 Ga main, sambhawatah kisi nearesth adhinav taare kii aakraamak lahar ke kaaran saura niharika ke sikudne kii shuruyaat hui thi
 It is possible that such an aggressive wave has caused the nebula to start moving and receiving angular impulses
 dhire-dhire jab badal isaki ghurnan-gati ko badhaata gaya, to gurutvkarshan tathaa niskriyata ke kaaran yah ek sookshm-grahiy chakri ke aakaar main roopantarit ho gaya, jo ki iske ghurnan ke aksh ke lambavat thi
 Much of its weight accumulated at its center and began to heat up, but the angular impulses and collisions of other large remains created microscopic deflections that created a medium by which micro-planets of several kilometers in length were formed
 Construction began, which began to revolve around the center of the nebula
 padaarthon ke girane, ghurnan kii gati main vruddhi tathaa gurutvkarshan ke dabaav ne centre main atyadhik gatij urja kaa nirmaan kiya
 Through any other process at a speed that would be able to release this formation, its inability to transfer that energy to another location resulted in the heating of the center of the circle
 antat helium main hydrogen ke nabhikeey galan kii shuruyaat hui or antat, sankuchan ke baad ek tii tori taare ke jalane se surya kaa nirmaan hua
 Meanwhile, due to gravity, when matter began to condense around previously obstructed objects outside the gravitational limits of the new Sun, dust particles and the remaining micro-planetary circles began to separate into rings
 samay ke saath-saath bade khand ek-duusare se takraaye or bade padaarthon kaa nirmaan hua, jo antat sookshm-grah ban gayi
 It also included a collection located about 150 million kilometers from the center: Earth
 The planet was formed around 4
54 billion years ago and most of it was completed within 10-20 million years
 navnirmit tii tori taare kii saura vaayu ne chakri ke us adhikansh padaarth ko hataa diya, jo bade pindon ke rup main ghaneebhoot nahin hua tha
 Computer simulations show that from a microscopic planetary planetary planets can be formed, the distance between which is equal to the distance between the planets in our solar system
 ab vyapak rup se sweekaar kii jane vaali niharika kii avadharana ke anusaar jis prakriya se saura-mandal ke grahon kaa udai hua, vahi prakriya brahmand main banane vaale sabhi naye taron ke chaaron ore abhivruddhi chakariyon kaa nirmaan karti he, jinamein se kuch taron se grahon kaa nirmaan hota he
 The evolution of ancient-earth continued from accretion, until the interior of the micro-planet was sufficiently hot to melt heavy, ferrous metals
 aise drav dhaatu, jinke ghanatv ab ucchtar ho chukaa tha, prithvi ke bhaar ke centre main ekatrit hone lage
 As a result of this so-called iron holocaust, an ancient mantle and a center were separated in only 10 million years after the creation of the Earth, which formed the Earth's level structure and created the Earth's magnetic field
 puraatan-grah par padaarthon ke sanchayan ke dauraan, gasiy silica ke ek badal ne avashya hi prithvi ko gher liya hoga, jo baad main isaki sataha par thos chattaanon ke rup main ghaneebhoot ho gaya
 Now around this planet, an initial atmosphere of the solar-nebula's optical elements, most of which were made up of hydrogen and helium, remained, but the heat of solar-air and Earth must have removed this atmosphere
 jab prithvi kii vartmaan trigya main lagbhag 40% kii vruddhi hui to isamen parivartan hua or gurutvkarshan ne vaataavaran ko rokkar rakhaa, jisamen pani bhi shaamil tha
 Earth's relatively large natural satellite, the Moon, is unique
 apollo kaarykram ke dauraan, chandramaa kii sataha se chattaanon ke tukade prithvi par laae gaye
 Radiometric dating of these rocks has revealed that the age of the Moon is 4527 ± 10 million years, which is about 30 to 55 million years less than other bodies of the Solar System
 bhi kaha jaataa he, aakaar main vartmaan mangal grah se thodaa chota rahaa hoga
 It is likely that it was formed by accumulating matter at their fourth or fifth Lagrangian point, 150 million kilometers away from the Sun and Earth
 shaayad prarambh main uski kaksha sthir rahi hogi, lekin padaarth ke sanchayan ke kaaran jab theia kaa bhaar badhane laga, to vah asantulit ho gai hogi
 Theia's rotation-orbit around the Lagrangian point progressed and eventually collided with the Earth at about 4
533 Ga
 model yah darshaate hai ki jab is aakaar kaa ek sanghatkaari grah ek nimna kone par tathaa apekshaakrit dhimi gati se puraatan-prithvi se takaraayaa, to puraatan-prithvi tathaa prabhavakaari grah kii bhitari parat va bahari aavarnon se niklaa adhikansh padaarth antariksh main uchhal gaya, jahaan isamen se adhikansh prithvi ke chaaron ore sthit kaksha main bana rahaa
 Eventually this substance created the Moon
 haalanki, sanghatkaari grah ke dhaatu-sadrush tatv prithvi ke tatv ke saath milakar isaki sataha ke neeche chale gaye, jisase chandramaa dhaatu-sadrush tatwon se vanchit rah gaya
 Thus the concept of giant impact makes the moon's unusual structure clear
 sambhav he ki prithvi ke chaaron ore sthit kaksha main utsarjit padaarth do saptahon main hi ek pind ke rup main ghaneebhoot ho gaya ho
 Under the influence of its own gravity, this emitted material turned into a more circular body: the Moon
 radiometric gananaa yah darshaati he ki prithvi kaa astitv is sanghaat ke kam se kam 10 million varsh purv se hi tha, jo ki prithvi ke praarambhik aavaran va aantarik parat ke bich vibhed ke liye paryaapt avadhi he
 Subsequently, when the impact occurred, only the substance of the upper cover was emitted, and the heavy siderophile elements in the Earth's inner cover remained untouched
 yuva prithvi ke liye is sanghaat ke kuch parinaam bahut mahatvapurn the
 This produced a large amount of energy, which caused both the Earth and Moon to melt completely
 is sanghaat ke turant baad, prithvi kaa aavaran atyadhik samvahak tha, isaki sataha megma ke ek bade mahaasaagar main badal gai thi
 The planet's first atmosphere must have been completely destroyed due to this impact
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki is sanghaat ke kaaran prithvi ke aksh main bhi parivartan ho gaya va isamen 23
5° kaa aksheeya jhukaav utpann hua, jo ki prithvi par mausam ke badlaav ke liye zimmedaar he 
 isane prithvi ke ghoomane kii gati bhi badha di hoti
 Since the Earth became devoid of atmosphere immediately after the huge impact, it must have cooled quickly

 In the energetic chemistry of early Earth, a molecule acquired the ability to make copies of itself — a replicator
 The copy was not always accurate: some copies were slightly different from their parents

 Although there is a difference in estimates, by about 3 Ga, perhaps something similar to the current oxygen-rich synthesis had developed, which made the sun's energy available not only to autotrophs, but also to those who eat it
 This type of synthesis, which by then had become the most common, used abundant carbon dioxide and water as raw materials and produced energy-rich organic molecules, along with the energy of sunlight
 
 iske alaava, is sanshleshan ke ek apshisht utpaada ke rup main oxigen utsarjeet kiya jaataa tha

 There is ample evidence of this in the abundant levels of iron-oxide found in the geological layers of this period

 Over time, the host cell acquired some genes of the small cell and now these two types became interdependent: the larger cell could not survive without the energy generated by the smaller cells, and the smaller ones on the other hand Cells could not survive without the raw materials provided by the large cell

 Prior to that time, reconstructions could not rely on similarities seen in the periods or coasts of oceanic surfaces, but only on geological observations and paleomagnetic data

 It is highly likely that Rodinia was not the first supercontinent and many older supercontinents have also been proposed
 iskaa arth yah he ki vartmaan plate tectonic jaisi prakriyaayein proterosoik ke dauraan bhi sakriy rahi thim
 After the dissolution of Rodinia around 800 Ma, it is possible that the continents rejoined around 500 Ma

 As Rodinia was focused on equinoxes, chemical weathering rates increased and carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere
 chunki CO2 ek mahatvapurn greenhouse gas he, atah puri prithvi par mausam thanda ho gaya
 Similarly, during Snowball Earth most of the continental surface was permanently frozen by ice, which again reduced chemical weathering, leading to the end of glaciation

 In organisms such as snails, echinoderms, cranoids, and arthropods, the development of solid body parts, such as armor, skeletons, or external skeletons, made preservation and bacterialization of such forms of life much easier than in their Proterozoic ancestors
 yahi kaaran he ki puraane yugon kii tulana main cambrian tathaa uske baad ke jivan ke bare main bahut adhik jaankaree uplabdh he
