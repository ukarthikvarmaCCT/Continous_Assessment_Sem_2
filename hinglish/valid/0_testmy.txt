 It is available for general use under the GPL v 2 license and some part of it is inspired by Unix
 multah yah minix kaa vikaas kar banaaya gaya he
 Development of Unix, AT&T in the 1960s Carried out by the Bell Laboratory
 us samay i
tii
&tii
 company ek niyantrit ijaaredaari thi isliye vah kamputer kaa sauftware nahi bench sakati thi
 He gave it, along with the source code, unconditionally, to the government and universities, which they can tweak if they want
 1980 ke dashak ke aate aate unics sabase lokapriy, shakti shaali, evam sthir auparating system ban gaya haalanki us samay tak uske kai roopaantar aa chuke the
 Unix had one drawback - it is difficult to understand and operate
 andrew tenenbam, aimusterdam main computer vigyaan ke professor hai
 He wrote a program called Minix to help it
 isamen bhi kuch kamiyaan thim
 Linus Torvald was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland
 unhone minix kii kami ko dur karne ke liye ek program likhaa jo ki baad main ‘linus kaa unics’ yaa chote main linaks kahalaaya
 His first core or Karnal was posted in Internet in 1991
 tab tak richard stallmen kaa 'gnu' project shuru ho chukaa tha
 Linus Torvald took many programs from this in his Linux
 isliye richard stallmen kaa kahana he
 That it should be called 'gnu-linux'
 par yah naam, shaayad lambaa rahane ke kaaran chal nahin paaya
 But this does not mean that the GNU project is not involved in the success of Linux
 gnew project ke bina linaks sambhav nahin tha
 The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented at AT & T's Bell Laboratories in the United States in 1969 by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas mcilroy and Joe Ossan
 unics pehali baar 1971 main relies hua, or puri tarah se assembly bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha, jaisaa ki us samay aam abhyaas tha
 Later, in a major pioneering approach in 1973, it was written by Dennis Ritchie in some programming language
 unics ke ucch stareey bhashaa karyanvayan kii uplabdhta ne vibhinn computer platformon ko apane porting ko aasaan bana diya
 Due to an antitrust case prior to entering the Computer Enterprise case, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone
 natijatan, unics jaldi bad gaya or academik sansthaanon or vyavsaayon dwaara vyapak rup se apanaaya gaya
 In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; Free of legal liability requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not legally allowed to modify Unix
 richard stollman dwaara 1983 main shuru hui jienyu pariyojna kaa lakshya "purna unics-sangat software system" banane kaa lakshya tha jo puri tarah se muft software se bana tha
 Work began in 1984
 baad main, 1985 main, stallman ne free software foundation kii shuruyaat kii or 1989 main jienyu general public license likhaa
 By the early 1990s, many programs (text editors, Unix shells, and a windowing system) required in an operating system were complete, although device drivers, daemons, and kernels, called GNU / Herd, were low-level
 The elements were intercepted and incomplete
 linas torwaldas ne kaha he ki yadi us samay jienyu karnel uplabdh to, usne apana khud kaa likhane kaa faisla nahin kiya hoga
 Minix was created by computer science professor Andrew S
 Tanenbaum, and was released in 1987 as an Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn operating system principles
 haalanki MINIX kaa puraa strot code swatantra rup se uplabdh tha, licencing sharton ne april 2000 main licencing badalane tak ise muft software hone se roka
 There is no office of Linux, no company or person owns it
 par duniya bhar ke programmer isamen apana yogadan dete hai
 In the history of the world, this kind of movement, never happened
 vah bhi jo ek america se baahar ke vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr ne shuru kiya
 Because in computer science, it was America's dominance to show new directions

 But no one knows what his conditions are

 There is a lot of speculation on the internet about why these lawsuits are going on

 yah utana hi saral ho saktaa he jitna ki kagaz kaa ek patrak hota he jisamen sabhi byaap tepon or un tarikhon kii ek suchi hoti he, jin tarikhon ko unhen taiyaar kiya gaya tha yaa yah computarikrut suchakank, suchi, yaa sambandhparak database yukt ek adhik parishkrut seoup ho saktaa he
 Different repository models have different advantages
 yah ek byaap roteshan skim se kaaphi kareeb se judaa he
 Backups can also be used when installing from one operating system to another
 istemaal hone vaale ripogitary model kii parvaah kiye bina data ko kisi jagah kisi data bhandaran madhyam main sangrahit karnaa padataa he
 Regardless of the data repository model or data storage medium used for backup, a balance needs to be maintained between accessibility, security, and cost
 madhyam prabandhan ke ye tareeke paraspar anany nahin hai or halaat kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye inhen aksar ek saath mila diya jaataa he
 a common example is the use of on-line disks to stage data before sending it to a near-line tape library
 byaap lene ke ek safal kaam kii shuruyaat data kii susangat ikaayiyon ke chayan or nishkasana se hoti he
 Most data in modern computer systems are stored in discrete units known as files
 in filon ko filasistamon main vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 Files that are being actively updated can be considered "live", which presents a challenge to backup
 yah us metadata ko bhi sahejane ke liye upyogi he jo byaap liye jane vaale computer yaa filasystem kaa varnan karte hai
 The process of deciding what to backup in a specified time is more difficult than it seems
 bahut zyada anaavashyak data kaa byaap lene se data ripogitary bahut jald bhar jayega
 aparyaapt pariman main data kaa byaap lene se ant main mahatvapurn jaankaree kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 If a computer system is in use at the time it is being backed up, then the possibility of files being opened for reading or writing is real
 yadi koi fil khulaa he, discs kii saamagree fil ke maalik kii icchit saamagree ko sahi bhang se pradarshit nahin kar saktaa he
 This is especially true for all types of database files
 faji byaap shabd kaa istemaal live data ke ek byaap kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he jo dekhne main to aisa lagata he maano yah sahi bhang se chaalu he lekin kabhi kisi bhi samay data kii sthiti ko pradarshit nahin karata he
 The reason for this is that the data that is being backed up changes in the time period between when the backup starts and ends
 vishesh rup se database ke liye, faji byaap bekaar hote hai
 Not all information stored on the computer is stored in files
 scrtch se ek puure system ko sahi tareeke se hasil karne ke liye is gaiyr-fil data kaa trek rakhana bhi zaruri hota he
 It is often necessary or necessary to manipulate the data being protected to optimize the backup process
 in jodtod se kai phaayde hote hai jinamein byaap gati, punah prapti gati, data suraksha, media kaa istemaal or bandwidth kii aavashyaktaaen shaamil he
 It is important to understand that backup is a process
 jab tak nae data banaaye ja rahe hai or parivartan kiye ja rahe hai, byaap ko adhyatan kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa padati rahegi
 ek computer se hajaaron computer pranaaliyon vaale vyaktiyon or sanghathanon tak sabhi ko data bachaane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The objectives and boundaries are essentially the same even if the scale is different
 isi tarah, jo log byaap karte hai unke liye paimaane kii parvaah kiye bina yah jaananaa jaruri he ki ve kis had tak safal rahe he
 An effective backup plan will take into account the limitations of the situation
 uparokt simaaon ke saamne paribhaashit uddeshyon ko praapt karnaa ek mushkil kaam ho saktaa he
 The tools and concepts outlined below can make this task more accessible
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki byaap yojana ummid ke anuroop kaam kar rahi he, is prakriya ko pramukh karkon kii nigaraanee mahatvapurn or aitihaasik data ko banaae rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 Backups and backup systems are often confused with archiving and fault tolerant systems due to considerable technology overlap 
 byaap abhilekhagaaron se is arth main alag he ki abhilekhaagaar data kii praathmik pratilipi hai, jinhen aamtaur par bhavishya main upyog ke liye alag rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki byaap kisi data kii dwitiyak pratilipi he jise mul vastu ke sthaan par saath rakhaa jaataa he
 The backup system differs from the fault-tolerant system in the sense that the backup system believes that a fault will cause data loss and the fault-tolerant system assures that it will not

 Second meaning is a Blind devotion that needs cruel sacrifices in any form
 3) -bangalore: - To fire a worker because his or her job is getting outsourced to an offshore company overseas
 It's a City in India by the name Banglore, which was taken verbatim as a verb

 8)- Aryan:- is derived from the Sanskrit ‘arya’
 It is also present in Latin and Greek, but is believed to ultimately root from Sanskrit
 In the 18th century in Sanskrit, the word meant ‘speaker of the North Indian language’
 In the 1830s Aryan was expanded to mean ‘speaker of indo-european languages’ since it was discovered that Iranians also used the same word for the same meaning
 In Nazi Germany, the main meaning of Aryan was considered to be ‘non-jewish’ and Aryans were recognized by features such as blonde hair and blue eyes
 Hindu religion today is only the leftover of the most ancient civilization of the world, note the word the most, Aryan
 Even Swami vivekanand didn't want that religion to die uselessly therefore he founded an organisation called Arya Samaj

 vah shaks, yah sab dekhakar dehshat main pad jaataa he or bhaag nikalataa he
 The story then turns to the newly emerging model, 20-year-old Nandita, who is in love with Yash, who is the director and host of a real serial "superstition", which makes films on various supernatural ghosts and superstitions like Tantric Vudu

 is baar yash janmdin ke maukey par nandita ko bataur tohafaa ek apartment detaa he, ve nai jindagi kii shuruyaat karte he or donon prem main lipt hote hai, kuch vakt baad nandita garbhvatee hoti he
 One evening, Nandita encounters a very aspiring artist named Prithvi who reaches him in search of his masterpiece
 prithvi use bataata he ki 4 maah pehle usne ek ladki kii scaching banaai thi, jo asal main nandita kii thi
 He also shows the painting in which his wrist is lying on the cut
 vah nandita se kisi bhi khatre ke prati chaukas rahane ko aagaah karata he
 But ignoring the matter of Prithvi, Nandita suddenly has a phantom cut her wrist in the bathroom
 prithvi use bachaata he or aspataal main bharti karaata he
 Yash rushes to the hospital and tries to find out her pregnancy and tells that her abortion is now difficult due to excessive bleeding
 vah yash se prithvi ke bare main shikaayat karti he, or yash use giraftaar karata he,magar jald hi vah vahaan se chhut jaataa he
 Meanwhile, at Kalindi, the American, David Cooper, who owns Kalindi's chemical factory, also writes himself with his own blood on the wall of his room before hanging himself, saying, "you are impure, Rotten from inside "
 vahiin is aatmahatya kii tahakiqaat kar rahaa inspector bhi iske buree prabhaav kii chapet main aata he
 Back in his house, Prithvi makes another picture in which a mob attacks Nandita
 vah us fishan sho main jaataa he jahaan nandita apana pradarshan karti he, or usapar jaise bhoot savaar hota he or sho main upasthit ek aadhyatmik guru par hamalaa kar baithti he
 She then repeats the same lines, telling him, "you are impure, rotten inside"
 prithvi use bachaane ko daudta he, magar vahaan maujuud guard dwaara roak liya jaataa he
 Nandita is kept away from the teacher and the audience
 kuch vakt baad tivi par guru ji kaa saakshaatkaar dikhaaya jaataa he, jo nandita par kisi pret ke haaavee hone kii baat kehete hai
 Knowing everything there, Yash publicly apologizes the most, and reveals that he is in fact troubled by mental problems
 udhar gards ke haathon prithvi ke chhootane baad, nandita ko phir se bathroom main vah pret dikhaai padataa he, jo dubaara vahi panktiyaan shishe main likh di jaati he
 She goes to ask for help from Earth, but he denies her, showing this picture in which she has hanged herself and the same lines are written near her
 phir vah us samachar kii cliping bhi dikhaata he jisamen us pujari or david kupar kii maut hui he,or unheen peeche vahi samaan panktiyaan likhi gai thi
 Nandita thanks her and reaches Yash's convening party to attend
 par vahaan pahunch kar bhi bhoot usape haaavee hota he or, khud ko hi ghayal karti he or khun bahane lagata he
 Meanwhile, the Earth is ready for his help by burning that wretched future picture of Nandita, to the point that he will save her life
 vah nandita ko party se bhaagate dekh letaa he, khun se tar, or phir vah uske peeche pad jaataa he
 Eventually he finds her in a slum area, where she was writing the same lines repeating
 prithvi use rokane kii koshish karata he magar vah jaan jaataa he ki nandita par pret haaavee he
 Nandita tries her best to be happy but the earth stops her from doing so
 yash tabhi bhaagta hua pahunchataa he or nandita ko prithvi kii banhon main paata he

 Within those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the county seat
 Some of the world's larger cities culturally, if not officially, span into multiple counties and those crossing state or provincial boundaries culturally are quite common as well, but are rarely involved within the same municipal government
 Many sister cities share a water boundary which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties
 For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as a large city, while locally they are each culturally different and occupy different counties

 An effective tool for physicists Early Raman effect was used in research studies by physicists
 pehle 7 varshon main is prabhaav ko aadhaar bana kar 700 se adhik vaigyanik shodh patr prastut kiye gaye
 On the one hand, in terms of theoretical physics, this effect provided a strong basis for quantum physics, while on the other hand it gave experimental physicists a highly efficient, simple technique for studying the structures of crystals and molecules
 phir dhire-dhire bhautikavidon kii is nai takanic main ruchi kam hone lagi
 But by then this technique was becoming popular among chemists as an analytical tool

 But the Raman effect again became popular among scientific inventors from the 1960s after the discovery of laser
 raman prabhaav ke sansuchan main sabase kathin samasya yah thi ki raman rekhaaen bahut ksheen hoti thim isliye unke sansuchan ke liye atyant teevr prakaash strot kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The laser not only provided such a very intense light source, but introduced new effects in the scattering light that added new dimensions to Raman spectrometry
 parinamswaroop raman spectroscopy ke anek parivartt viksit hue
 The basic concepts used in these include paginated Raman for sensitivity enhancement, Raman microscopy for improving spatial resolution, and resonance Raman for highly specific information acquisition
