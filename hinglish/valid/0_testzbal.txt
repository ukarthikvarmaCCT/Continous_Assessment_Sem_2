 unka faisla ekadam uchit tathaa tarksangat tha, phir bhi main unki baat ko sweekaar na kar sakaa
 i was dissuaded from his decision as if i had no faith in the experiences, knowledge and wisdom of my father at such an age
 maine yah bhi nahin sochaa ek pita hone ke naate unhen mere sambandh main faisla karne kaa haq tha
 Then i must have been about eleven years old
 mere pita ne mujhe aagaamee jivan kii achchhai-buraai, oonch-neech kaa bhed bataakar bahut samajhane kii koshish kii
 Scolded, reprimanded, intimidated me, also told me about the benefits and facilities of the government job with love, but i will not get lice on my ear
 aakhir meri ragon main bhi to unheen kaa khun gardish kar rahaa tha, ziddee swabhaav mujhe unheen se viraasat main mila tha
 i was determined that i will not do a government job at any cost
 pitaaji ke naanaa prakaar ke pralobhan bhi mujhe mere faisle se diga nahin sake
 Actually, i was too ambitious
 apane pathan-pathan kaa kaary sheeghra purna kar main apni icchaanusaar charchit sthanon par ghoomane nikal jaaya karata tha
 Today, when i think of my past life, i feel astonished that what was the reason that nature had fascinated me so much? In those days i had become so attached to nature that i could not even have compulsory attendance in school
 mere pita tathaa mere sambandhon main katutaa aane lagi thi
 Now we did not do any work among ourselves, but there was a situation of silent opposition among us
 lekin jab mujhe anubhav hua ki ab pitaaji se bina baat kiye kaam nahin ban paayegaa to maine unase baat karne kaa nishchay kiya
 i did not want to get a government post and stick to a chair
 puure din bekaar ke formon par pan chalaanaa mujhe jaraa bhi pasand nahin tha
 i told Dad - "dad! i am not willing to do a government job, but to be a painter
 ’’mere kathan ne unke krodh kii chingaari ko bhadkaa diya
 He said in a warning tone - "painter 


!" Until i die, this childish desire of yours is impossible to fulfill
 ’’ But where was i going to believe! My interest grew in subjects such as geography and general history, this interest of mine helped the artist hidden within me a lot
 shesh vishyon par main jaraa bhi dhyaan nahin detaa tha
 That is why i stood first in my class in both these subjects, but fell behind in other subjects
 itihaas kaa gaharaai se adhyayan karne ke kaaran mujhe do laabh hue–pehla laabh to mujhe yah mila ki meraa rashtravaadi drushtikon prakhar ho gaya tha

 With the nationalization of the bank, a new festival has started to advance the direction of social and economic development of India

 At the same time, the Indian banking system is not only a profit making industry through mere transactions, deposits or loans, but also a strong means of social and economic revival of the poor, Dalit sections of the Indian society and raising them economically

 bank rashtriyakaran kii sutaradhar saudamini shrimati indira gandhi ko puraa yakeen tha ki yah banking udyog raashtra ke sarvageen vikaas evam punarutthan kii disha main teji laayegaa
 While launching the historic festival of nationalization of banks, Mrs
 Indiraji said that "an institution like banking system, which reaches tens of thousands of people and which should reach millions of people, must necessarily have a larger social purpose behind it
 It should be motivated and these sectors should contribute to fulfill national priorities and objectives
 " is vishwaas ko sarthak karne kii prakriya main hi 200 karod rupee se adhik jamaa raashi vaale or chha: bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran 15 april 1980 ko kar diya gaya
 Prior to nationalization, all commercial banks had their own separate and independent policies and their purpose was limited to paving the way for maximum profit which should be considered natural as most of the share holders of these banks were few bourgeois persons who Along with protecting their interests, private beneficiaries used to benefit banking services and facilities

 Before the nationalization of the bank the condition of the farmers was so bad that a bitter truth is said about them that the Indian farmer is born in debt
 karj main hi palata he or peeche karj chhodkar hi marataa he
 As a result, the capitalists became more prosperous in such a situation and the poor got further crushed into two parts of poverty and a crisis of severe social imbalance occurred in the country
 saamaajik asantulan ke saath hi raashtra jabardast aarthik vishmataaon ke kodh main ulajh gaya
 In this way, the pace of social and economic development was blocked, due to which the need for revolutionary new economic policy was felt, so it was a national necessity to nationalize the backbone of the economy of the country and nationalize the banks
 
 falat: bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran kiya gaya
 The basic objective in this nationalization was that the banking system should play an important role in extending the benefits of banking services and facilities to all other sectors including the weaker sections of the society by providing active support in the economic development oriented works of the country
 is prakaar pramukh vanijyik bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran karne ke mul uddeshy the
 Expanding banking facilities and services, prior to nationalization, banking services were confined to a few bourgeoisie and big businessmen and farmers, resulting in a huge economic rift between the two sections of society
 is aarthik vishmata ko dur karne hetu bankig sevaaon evam suvidhaon kaa laabh samaaj main sabhi virgon visheshat: gramin kasbaai kshetron main based kamjor virgon tak pahunchane kaa mul uddeshy bainkon ke rashtriyakaran main nihit he
 Economic development of the country can be considered as the second objective
 jaisaa ki pehle bhi kaha ja chukaa he ki bank rashtriyakaran ke pehle desh main aarthik sankat utpann hone ke kaaran aarthik vikaas kii gati avaruddh ho gai thi
 Therefore, to accelerate the economic development of the country, nationalization of banks had become very necessary because for the progress and prosperity of any country, its economic development plays an important role
 bank rashtriyakaran kaa teesraa uddeshy tha desh main berogari kii samasya
 It has been the main concern of India that the solution to this problem could be found through the nationalization of banks as unemployed could be controlled by increasing their own private industry or many means of self-employment through financial assistance to the educated unemployed
 
 jab tak desh main berogari kii samasya kaa uchit hal nahin hota tab tak uske vikaas kaary main teji nahin aa sakati
 Keeping in view this fact, it was necessary to take concrete steps towards eradication of unemployment so that they could pave the way for their progress by joining the educated unemployed with the benefit of banking services and assistance
 bank rashtriyakaran kaa ek uddeshy yah bhi tha ki samaaj ke kam jor virgon tathaa praathamikta praapt kshetron ke logon kaa banking sevaaon evam suvidhaon ke madhyam se utthan karke desh kii aarthik unnati ko ek nai disha pradaan karana
 It became very necessary to contribute to the economic progress of the weaker sections and priority sectors of the country, ie small and medium farmers, landless laborers, educated unemployed, small artisans, etc
, because people of such classes were spread all over the country and their number Was enough
 samaaj main ve apekshit bhi the
 Therefore, creating new confidence in the people of the classes and bringing them on the path of progress and prosperity had become very necessary for the overall progress of the country
 at: banking suvidha ke madhyam se hi inkaa vikaas sambhav tha
 As a result, the idea of bank nationalization emerged
 bainkon ke rashtriyakaran kaa ek or mul uddeshy tha gramin kshetron kii sthiti main sudhaar tathaa krishi evam laghu udyogon ke kshetron kii samuchit pragati kiya janaa
 The Indian farmer remained neglected from time to time, and every time he got bitten by others
 falat: vah garibi kii parton se upar nahin uth sakaa tha
 This was the condition of cottage industries and small scale industries
 ye vyavsaay adhiktar krishi par hi nirbhar karte the or krishi or krishi kaa kshetra upekshit tathaa aviksit hone ke kaaran in udyogon kaa bhi pragati nahin ho pai thi
 Thus, improving the economic condition of neglected sectors like agriculture and small industries by paying due attention to them, became very necessary and indispensable for the progress of the nation
 desh ke biimaar udyogon ko punarujjivit karke nae laghu-stareey udyogon ke nav nirmaan ko badhaava dena bhi bainkon ke rashtriyakaran kaa ek uddeshy tha
 This was also one of the reasons for the economic slowdown due to sick industries increasing the problem of unemployment, so it was necessary to revive such industries by giving them financial assistance
 iske saath hi laghu-stareey udyogon kii sankhya paryaapt nahin thi jisase kasbaai kshetron kii pragati main teji nahin aa paa rahi thi or aise udhyami hameshaa videsh kii ore ankhen lagaakar baithe hue hote the
 Therefore, promotion of small-scale industries was also necessary for the progress of the country, which seemed impossible without financial support
 at: bainkon dwaara aarthik niyojan ke liye unpar sarkaar kaa swamitya hona ek aavashyak baat ho gai thi
 In this way, banks were nationalized due to many social and economic objectives, so that the progress of the society in a different way with the advancement of weaker and neglected sections
 rashtriyakaran ke baad unki shakhaon ke vistaar ke saath hi unke dwaara kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon main aashcharyakaarak pragati hui he
 All these nationalized banks are committed to the proper progress of the social and economic development works of the country and according to the policy of the government, the people of the weaker sections and backward castes and tribes will be fully supported by the government in their national work above their low level by financial assistance

 dharm ne prithvi se poocha - "he devi! tumhaara mukh malin kyon ho rahaa he? kis baat kii tumhen chintaa he? kahin tum meri chintaa to nahin kar rahi ho ki ab meraa keval ek pair hi rah gaya he yaa phir tumhen is baat kii chintaa he ki ab tum par shudra rajya karenge?" Prithvi said - "O religion! You, despite being omniscient, ask me the reason for my grief! Truth, purity, forgiveness, mercy, contentment, renunciation, sham, dum, tenacity, simplicity, ability, scriptural consideration, overhead, learning, knowledge Contains qualities like quietness, valor, sharpness, opulence, force, memory, talent, skill, freedom, boldness, tenderness, patience, courage, modesty, humility, good luck, enthusiasm, seriousness, fame, faithfulness, stability, pride, egolessness etc

 " jab dharm or prithvi ye baaten kar hi rahe the ki mukutadhaari shudra ke rup main kaliyug vahaan aayaa or un donon ko maarane laga
 King Parikshit was passing by while doing Digvijay
 unhone mukutadhaari shudra ko haath main danda liye ek gaay or ek bail ko buree tarah peetate dekha
 The bull was very beautiful, it was white and had only one leg
 gaay bhi kamdhenu ke samaan sundar thi
 Both were shivering in fear
 maharaj parakshit apane dhanushwan ko chadhaakar megh ke samaan gambheer vaani main lalakaare - "re dusht! paapi! naradham! tu koun he? in nirih gaay tathaa bail kyon sata rahaa he? tu mahaan apradhi he
 The only punishment for your crime is your slaughter
 " unke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug bhay se kaanpane laga
 The Maharaj asked the bull that, o ox, your three legs are broken
 tum bail ho yaa koi devtaa ho
 Hey Dhenuputra! You tell me your own account fearlessly
 he gaumata! ab tum bhaymukt ho jaao
 i punish the wicked
 kis dusht ne mere rajya main ghor paap kar ke pandavon kii pavitra kirti main yah kalank lagaaya he? chaahe vah paapi saakshaat devtaa hi kyon na ho main uske bhi haath kaat doongaa
 Then Dharma said - "O Maharaj! You are born in the clan of the Pandavas, the supreme devotees of Lord Krishna, so these words are worthy of you
 he rajan! ham yah nahin jaanate ki sansar ke jeevon ko koun klesh detaa he
 It has been described in many ways in the scriptures as well
 jo dwait ko nahin maanata vah dukh kaa kaaran apane aap ko hi sweekaar karata hai
 One considers destiny as the cause of sorrow and one considers karma as the cause of sorrow
 katipay vidwaan swabhaav ko or katipay ishwar ko bhi dukh kaa kaaran maanate hai
 So, o Rajan! Now you decide who is the cause of the misery
 " On hearing the words of the bull, the Emperor Parikshit said - "O Taurus! You are definitely a religion in the form of a bull and this cow god is Prithvi Mata
 aap dharm ke marm ko bhalee-bhanti jaanate hai
 You can not cheat anyone, that is why you are not giving the name of the person who is suffering

 The evil sinful Shudra kings will enjoy this beautiful land due to Lord Srikrishna Chandra's own movement, that is why this mother is also sad
 " Saying so, King Parikshit took out his sharp-edged sword to kill that sinful Shudra royalty Kali Yuga
 kaliyug ne bhaybheet hokar apane rajasi vesh ko utaar kar raja parakshit ke charnon main gir gaya or traahi-traahi kehane laga
 King Parikshit was a great refugee Vatsal, he did not think it appropriate to kill the Kaliyuga who came in the asylum and said to the Kaliyuga - "O Kaliyuga! You have come to my refuge, so i gave you my life
 kintu adharm, paap, jhooth, chori, kapat, daridrata aadi anek updravon kaa mul kaaran keval tu hi he
 Therefore, leave my kingdom immediately and do not come back again
 " Hearing these words of King Parikshit, Kali Yuga said in a Katar voice - "O Rajan! Your kingdom is on the whole earth, there is no place outside my kingdom where i can reside
 he bhupati! aap bade dayaalu hai, aapane mujhe sharan diya he
 Now you have to manage some kind of my residence with mercy
 " When Kali Yuga said this, King Parikshit got into thinking
 phir vichaar kar ke unhone kaha - "he kaliyug! dyut, madhpan, parastrigaman or hinsa in chaar sthanon main asaty, mad, kaam or krodh kaa nivas hota he
 i allow you to live in these four places
 " is par kaliyug bolaa - "he uttaranandan! ye chaar sthaan mere nivas ke liye aparyaapt hai
 Please give me some other place of mercy
 " kaliyug ke is prakaar maangane par raja parakshit ne use paanchava sthaan 'swarna' diya
 Kali Yuga went away from there after meeting these places, but after going some distance, he came back in an invisible form and resided in the golden crown of King Parikshit
 iske baad parikshit shikaar ke liye bahut bhatke or bhukh or pyaas ke maare unka bura haal tha 
 Losing weary in the evening, he reached the ashram of Shamik Rishi and at that time the sage was absorbed in the Brahmin Samaghi
 
 Parikshit said that we are thirsty we need water, there is no one here, are you listening, we are talking about the king, we are thirsty, we need water, you do not hear whether the sage was a Brahmin in the tomb at that time
 - Three times asked for water but the sage's house was not broken
 
 Kaliyuga sitting in Rajmukut got inspired by his true wisdom and decided to punish the sage
 parantu raja ke achche sanskaro ke kaaran unhonen apane-aap ko us paap se roak liya 
 In a fit of rage, he put the dead snake around the sage

 All three started preparing carefully for this campaign
 in dinon bengal rajya kaa mukhyalay jis bhawan main hai, karnal simpasan kaa karyaalay kolkata kii usee ‘riters building’ main tha
 On December 8, 1930, the trio arrived there wearing English costumes
 unke prabhavi vyaktitv ke kaaran mukhya dwaar par unhen kisi ne nahin roka
 a peon was sitting outside Simpson's room
 usne teenon se kaha ki ve ek parche par apana naam or kaam likh den, to vah us parche ko sahab tak pahunchaa degaa
 But where did he have such a holiday? They pushed the peon inside and entered
 is dhakkamukki or shor se simpasan chaunk gaya; par jab tak vah saavdhaan hota, in teenon ne uske sharir main chah goliyaan ghusaa deen
 He immediately rolled to the ground
 teenon apana kaam puraa kar waapas laut chale
 But this firing and noise stirred the whole building
 vahaan ke surakshakarmi bhaagate hue teenon krantiviron ke peeche lag gayi
 The police also arrived shortly
 teenon goli chalaate hue baahar bhaagane kaa prayaas karne lage
 Running away, the three reached a verandah, which was closed from the other side
 yah dekhakar ve baraamde ke antim kamare main ghus gayi or use andar se band kar liya
 The people who were working in that room came out in fear and they latch the room from outside
 kamare ko police ne gher liya
 Shot kept from both sides; But then bullets stopped coming from inside
 police se khidki se jhankkar kar dekha, to teenon mitra dharti par ludhake hue the
 In fact, all three had decided before going on the expedition that even if they had to commit suicide; But they will not come in the hands of police
 is sangharsh main dinesh gupt police kii goli se buree tarah ghayal hua tha
 Sudhir shot himself with his pistol and committed suicide
 vinay ne bhi apni donon canpatiyon par goli maar lee thi; par uski mrityu nahin hui
 The police took the three into their possession
 dinesh or vinay ko aspataal bheja gaya
 Vinay did not accept food
 atah uski haalat bahut bighad gayi or 13 disambar ko uskaa pranant ho gaya
 Dinesh Gupta underwent an operation and the bullet was fired and then sent to jail
 mukademe ke baad saat july, 1931 ko use faansee de di gayi
 Thus, the three friends, while performing their duty towards the country, wrote their names in golden letters in the list of immortal sacrifices
 faansee ke 20 din baad kanhai laal bhattacharya ne us jaj ko nyaayalay main hi goli se uda diya, jisane dinesh gupt ko faansee kii sajaa di thi

 carch shabd unani visheshan kaa apbhransh he jiskaa shabdic arth he "prabhu kaa"
 In fact, the Church is used in two ways; One is the building of the Lord that is the Church and the other is the organization of Christians
 carch ke atirikt 'kalisia' shabd bhi chalata he
 It is a distorted form of the word 'ecclesia' in the Greek Bible; In the Bible it means - a local or community of Christians around the world
 baad main yah shabd girjaghar ke liye bhi prayukt hone laga
 Here the church will be considered in the sense of institution
 sabhi isai praaia: is baat se sahamat hai ki isa ne keval ek hi carch kii sthapana kii thi, kintu anek kaarnon se isaayiyon kii ekta akshunn nahin rah saki
 As a result, many of their churches or organizations exist today, which are completely independent of each other
 unka vargeekaran is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he : In the early centuries of Christianity, little has been done about the definition and form of the Church
 bible main isa kii jeevani tathaa shiksha kaa jo varnan he usase spasht he ki prarambh hi se isaayiyon kaa vishwaas tha ki is ne samast maanav jati ke liye mukti ke sadhano ko sulabh kar diya or is uddeshy se prithvi par "ishwar kaa rajya" sthapit kiya
 The "kingdom of God" is a community of people who believe in the divinity of Jesus and receive his teachings
 bible main us samudaay ko "ishwar ko praja" kaha gaya he
 For his organization and rule, Jesus selected 12 disciples and gave them special teaching and authority and ordered them to go around the world to preach their teachings and baptize believers into the church
 is prakaar bible main isa ke anuyaayiyon ke samudaay ko carch, "ishwar kaa rajya" tathaa "ishwar kii praja" kaha gaya he
 From these positions it may appear that initially the actual form of the church has been considered limited to external organization, but this is not the case
 isa ne apni shiksha main isapar bal diya he ki unamem tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon main adrishy evam rahasyatmak ekta he
 He said to his disciples- "I take the vine and you are the branches
" " isse spasht ho jaataa he ki carch kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv aadhyatmik hi he
 Saint Paul has laid great emphasis on this spiritual and mystic aspect of the church
 isa tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon kaa aadhyatmik sambandh or isa ke sabhi anuyaayiyon kii rahasyamay ekta ko spasht karne ke liye unhone apane patron main barambar carch ko "isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir" kaha he 
 Hence, from the beginning both the external organization of the church and its spiritual form have been taken care of
 protestant dharm ke kaaran carch main foot padi to dharmacharya carch ke swaroop par adhik chintan karne lage
 Protestant scholars put more emphasis on the invisible form of the church and in response to the Catholic Church's outward organization of the church, its visible membership, etc
 is vivaad main unhone carch ke chaar bahari lakshanon kaa apekshaakrit adhik mahatv diya he
 The true Church of Christ is Catholic; One is, in the bondage of love, all its members believe in the principles of religion
 ek sanskaar, ek si pujanapaddati or ek hi parmadhikari kaa shashan sweekaar karte hai; pavitra he ; apozels he The visible organization of the church may also include some people who are hypocrites who have no spiritual connection with Jesus, who are not part of Jesus' spiritual body
 ishwar hi jaanata he ki koun carch kaa sachcha sadsy he or is kaaran yah mana ja saktaa he ki vaastavik carch adrishy hi he
 Even then, the sacraments are the essential condition of full membership of that invisible real church, so cannot be separated from the invisible church
 aajkal praaia: sabhi protetianst bhi is baat ko maanate hai
 Even though full membership of the Church is required for salvation, it is not compulsory
 ishwar sabhi logon kii mukti chahta he or sab manushyon ke ant:karan main satprerana utpann karata he
 Those who follow the inspiration of God inadvertently become imperfect members of the Church invisibly and can achieve salvation provided by Jesus
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat isai sansar main carch kii ekta ke andolan ko adhik mahatv diya jane laga
 Consequently, in an effort to determine the true form of the church based on the elements existing in the Bible, excluding rebuttal, the emphasis is on the fact that the church is the spiritual body of Jesus
 isa uskaa sheersh he or sachche isai us sharir ke ang hai

 After the death of Jesus, his disciples started preaching Christianity among Jews and non-jews

 teesri shatabdi ke ant tak isai dharm vishaal roman samrajya ke sabhi nagaron main fail gaya tha; isi samay faras tathaa dakshin rus main bhi bahut se log isai ban gaye
 There are many reasons for this success
 ek to us samay logon main prabal dharmajigyaasa thi, duusare isai dharm prayek maanav kaa mahatv sikhalaataa tha, chaahe vah das athwa stri hi kyon na ho
 Apart from this, people could not live without being influenced by the spirit of Christianity

 Although the Roman rulers viewed the new religion with skepticism from the beginning and persecuted its followers, it was only in the third century that a complete attempt was made to completely eradicate the Christian religion, especially Desius, Diocliction, In the reigns of the Muskminians and Gallerius

 In the civil war that ensued for the successor after the renunciation of Dioclution, Constantine was victorious and he gave freedom to all religions by taking out the edict of Milan in 313 AD
 us samay ariyas ke mat ke kaaran isai sansar main ashaanti failane lagi thi
 To overcome this, Constantine organized the first World Assembly of the Catholic Church; This assembly of Nicaea declared in opposition to Aureus's belief that Jesus is God in real sense
 konstantin ke uttaradhikariyon ne ariyas ke anuyaayiyon kaa paksh liya, falswaroop lagbhag 50 varsh tak purvi katholic carch main itani avyavashtha rahi ki vahaan kaa carch us kuprabhav se kabhi mukt nahin ho paaya
 Towards the end of that century, the first real Christian emperor Theodosius declared Christianity as a religion; He also controlled the followers of Aureus and for that purpose organized the Second World Assembly of the Catholic Church in Küstüntunia

 After the rebellion the British officers of the Indian Army, especially those who had served in the First and Second Afghan Wars, began to give currency to the martial race doctrine
 yah siddhant tha ki kuch bhartiya jatiyon or samudaayon ke bich swaabhaavik rup se jangi, or adhik dusron kii tulana main yuddh ke liye anukool the
 a major proponent of this doctrine was Lord Roberts, who in November 1885 was the commander-in-chief, gradually "punjabisation" of the Indian Army to the detriment of other communities of the Indian Army

 The Mahars were not included in these class regiments, and it was notified that the Mahars, along with some other classes, were now enlisted in the Indian Army
 mahaar sainikon, jo 104 vysarai kamishan adhikari or gaiyr kamishan adhikariyon or sipaahiyon ke ek mejabaan shaamil demobilized the
 This incident was perceived by the Mahars as a betrayal of their loyalty by a governmental they had worked for over a hundred years
 After the demobilisation of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilized
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 B
 R
 Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganisation of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col v
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer noticed in dispatches
 They are also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Center was established at Kamptee
 The following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun Regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 His entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 haalanki 1990 main mul 204 minute kaa mul sanskaran bhi home media par uplabdh ho gaya tha
 Sholay first received negative reactions from critics and weak commercial results upon release, but a few days later it emerged as a huge box office success with the help of favorable verbal publicity
 film ne puure bharat main kai cinemagharon main nirantar pradarshan ke liye record tod die, or mumbai ke minerva theatre main to yah paanch saal se adhik samay tak pradarshit hui
 According to some sources, it is the highest-grossing Indian film when adjusted for inflation
 sholay ek dakaiti-vastern film he, jo vastern style ke saath bhartiya dakaiti filmon paramparaon kaa sangyojan karti he, or saath hi masala filmon kaa ek paribhaashit udhaaharan he, jisamen kai film shaileyon kaa mishran paaya jaataa he
 Scholars have referred to several themes of the film, such as the glorification of violence, the transformation of feudal ideas, the debate between those who uphold social order and organized robbery, gay non-romantic social bonds, and the film as a national framework

 In a small village called Ramgarh, retired police officer Thakur Baldev Singh calls two thieves, whom he once arrested
 thakur ko yakeen he ki ve donon – jai tathaa viru – kukhyat dakait gabbar singh ko pakadaney main uski sahaayta kar sakate hai
 Not only was there a cash reward of fifty thousand rupees for handing over live or dead police to Gabbar Singh, Thakur also offered an additional reward of twenty thousand rupees for bringing both of them alive and bringing Gabbar to him
 gabbar ke teen saathi ramgarh ke graminon se anaaj lene aate hai, par jai or veeru kii vajah se unhen khaali haath janaa padataa he
 Gabbar is very angry when he loses to only two people and kills them all
 iske baad vah holi ke din gaanv par hamalaa karata he or ek lambi ladaai ke baad jai or veeru ko bandhak bana letaa he
 Thakur does not help them despite being in a position to help them both
 jai or veeru kisi tarah batch nikalate hai, or thakur kii is akarmanyata se kshubdh hokar gaanv chhodkar jane kaa man bana lete hai
 Thakur then tells them how he arrested Gabbar a few years ago but he escaped from jail and then to take revenge he first killed Thakur's entire family, and then cut both hands of Thakur
 ise chupaane thakur shawl odhakar rahata tha
 While living in Ramgarh, Jai and Veeru slowly began to like the villagers
 jai ko thakur kii vidhwaa bahu radha or veeru ko gaanv main tanga chalaane vaali basanti se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, there are small squabbles between jai-veeru and Gabbar, and one day his men take Basanti and Veeru away
 jai unako bachaane jaataa he, or ve teenon vahaan se batch nikalate hai
 In this fight, Jai gets shot, leading to his death
 jai kii mrityu se acroshit veeru akele gabbar kaa peechha karata he or use pakad letaa he
 There is a scuffle between the two, in which Veeru is about to kill Gabbar that Thakur comes there and reminds him of Jai's promise to hand Gabbar alive
 veeru gabbar ko thakur ko saunp detaa he, jo apane nukile juuton se gabbar ke haath kuchal detaa he or phir use police ke hawaale kar detaa he
 Veeru leaves the lonely village and leaves for the railway station, where Basanti is waiting for him
 radha ek baar phir akeli hi rah jaati he
 The plan began when, about 6 months after the release of the Zanjeer film, salim-javed met GP Sippy and Ramesh Sippy, telling them the four-line story
 1973 se ve yah kahani kai nirmaataaon ko suna chuke the
 Two producers / directors also rejected his story completely
 ramesh sippi ko unki avadharana acchhee lagi or unhone unhen aage kaary karne hetu chun liya
 According to its actual plan, the film had two ex-soldiers selected by a military officer to avenge the murder of his family
 baad main us sainya adhikari kii jagah ek pulisavaale ne le lee, kyonki sippi ko laga ki is tarah ke drishy dikhaane ke liye anumati milanaa kaaphi kathin rahegaa
 salim-javed completed the story together in a month
 isamen unke naam se lekar un logon ke taur tareeke tak shaamil the
 The screenplay and dialogues of the film are written in hindi-urdu, especially in Urdu only
 saleem-javed ne inhen multah urdu lipi main likhaa tha, or phir ek assistant ne inhen devanagari main anudit kiya, taaki hindi padhane waalon ko bhi ye samaj aaen
 The film is based on Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and is a defining example of a dacoity western film, featuring Indian dacoity films, notably Mehboob Khan's Mother India and Dilip Kumar's Ganga Jamana, and Western films, particularly Se includes conferences from Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western such as Once Upon a Time in the West as well as The Magnificent Seven
 film ke kathanak main kuch tatv anya bhartiya filmon, jaise meraa gaanv meraa desh or khote sikke se liye gaye hai
 a scene depicting an attempt to rob the train was inspired by a similar scene in Ganga Jamna, and has also been compared to another similar scene in the North West Frontier
 thakur ke parivaar ke narsanhaar ko dikhaate ek drishy kii tulana vans apon e time in da west main mcben parivaar ke narsanhaar ke saath bhi kii gai he
 Sholay was also influenced by Sam Peckinpah's westerns, such as The Wild Bunch and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
 charitra gabbar singh ko usee naam ke ek vaastavik daaku par banaaya gaya tha, jiskaa 1950 ke dashak main gwalior ke aasapaas ke gaanvon main aatank tha
 The real Gabbar Singh, when he caught any policeman, cut off his ears and nose and left him, to show him as a warning to other policemen
 yah charitra ganga jamana se bhi prerit tha, jahaan dilip kumaar kaa charitra ganga ek daaku tha, jo gabbar ke samaan hi khadiboli or avadhi ke mishran se bani ek boli bolta tha
 The character was also influenced by the villain "el Indio" of Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More
 suurama bhopali, film kaa ek maamuli charitra, bhopal ke suurama naamak ek jangal adhikari par aadhaarit tha, jo abhinayta jagadeep kaa parichit tha
 Surma eventually had to threaten to sue, when people watching the film also started referring to him as a woodcutter
 sholay ke nirmaataaon ne shuruyaat main gabbar singh kii bhoomika hetu danni denjongpa ko chunaa tha, lekin ve is kirdaar hetu taiyaar nahin hue, kyonki vah pehle hi firoz khan kii dharmatma main kaam karne ke liye hami bhar chuke the, jiskaa filmakan samay bhi sholay ke samaan hi tha
 The second choice of the makers was Amjad Khan
 ve is kirdaar ko nibhaane ke liye taiyaar ho gaye or abhishpt chambal naamak ek pustak padhakar is charitra kii taiyaari karne lage
 This book, about Chambal's exploitation of dacoits, was written by his fellow artist Jaya Bhaduri's father Tarun Kumar Bhaduri
 sanjeev kumaar bhi gabbar singh kii bhoomika nibhaana chaahate the, lekin saleem-javed ko laga ki "unki pehle kii bhoomikaaon ke ke kaaran darshakon main unke prati sahanubhuti thi; gabbar ko puri tarah ghrunit hona tha
 " sippi chaahate the ki jai kaa kirdaar shatrughan sinha nibhaaen, lekin kai anya bade sitare is film main kaam kar rahe the, or isliye sinha ne manaa kar diya
 Amitabh Bachchan did not become so famous at that time; He had to work hard to get this character
 saleem-javed ne haalanki 1973 main hi sholay ke liye bachchan ke naam kii sifarish kar di thi; kyonki zanjeer film main unke abhinay ko dekhakar hi saleem-javed aashwast ho gaye the ki bachchan is film ke liye sahi abhinayta hai
 Because many members of the film had already read the plot, many actors were willing to play different roles
 praan ko pehle thakur baldev singh ke kirdaar ke liye chunaa gaya, lekin sippi ko sanjeev kumaar is kirdaar hetu behatar lage
 salim-javed also spoke to Dilip Kumar for Thakur's character, but he made up his mind at that time; Dilip Kumar later admitted that this was one of the few films he regretted leaving
 dharmendra ko bhi thakur ke kirdaar main ruchi thi, lekin jab unhen sippi ne bataaya ki yadi ve thakur bane to sanjeev kumaar ko viru kaa kirdaar de diya jaayegaa or phir hema malini ke saath unki jodi banegi
 The production of the film took a long time due to its four main characters
 iskaa filmakan shuru hone se chaar maheene purv hi amitabh ne jaya se shaadi kar lee
 The production of this film was further delayed due to Jaya becoming a mother and Abhishek Bachchan was born during the performance of this film
 dharmendra or hema malini ke premalap vaale drishyon ke dauraan bhi dharmendra puri mehnat par pani pher dete the, or is kaaran ek hi drishy ke liye kai baar mehnat kerani pad rahi thi
 They also got married five years after the film's release
 sholay ke adhaktar hisson ko karnataka ke bangalore nagar ke paas sthit ek chote se kasbe ramnagar ke chattani ilaakon main filmaaya gaya tha
 To ensure convenient access to the film sets, the makers had to construct a road from Bangalore Highway to Ramnagar
 kala nirdeshak ram yedekar dwaara is sthal ke paas hi ek puraa kritrim nagar banaaya gaya tha
 To match the natural lighting of the on-location set, a jail set was also built near Mumbai's Rajkamal Studio
 baad main thode samay ke liye ramnagar ke ek hisse ko film ke nirdeshak ke sammaan main "sippi nagar" kaa naam bhi diya gaya tha
 Till 2010, a visit to "sholay rocks" was also available to tourists visiting Ramnagar
 filmakan 3 oktober 1973 ko shuru hua, jisamen bachchan or bhaduree kaa ek drishy filmaaya gaya
 The production of the film was grand for its time; Parties and banquets were often organized for the artists, and because of this, its budget was increased, it took only two and a half years to complete it
 isaki ucch laagat kaa ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki sippi ne apana vaanchit prabhaav praapt karne ke liye ek baar filmaae ja chuke drishyon ko kai baar dobaaraa filmaaya
 The 5-minute song sequence of the song "yeh Dosti" took 21 days to shoot, two short scenes in which Radha lit the lamp, to be filmed in 20 days due to lighting problems, and one scene, in which Gabbar Imam's son Kills, gets shot in 19 days
 train main chori kaa drishy, jise mumbai-pune railmarg par panwel ke paas filmaaya gaya tha, 7 saptaah se bhi adhik samay main puraa ho paaya
 Sholay was the first Indian film to have a stereophonic soundtrack and to use the 70mm widescreen format
 haalanki, us samay vaastavik 70 mimi camere mahange the, isliye film ko pehle paaramparik 35 mimi film par hi shoot kiya gaya, or usase bani 4:3 kii tasveeron ko baad main 2
2:1 frem main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Regarding this process, Sippy said, "A 70mm format gives real enjoyment of the big screen and magnifies it further to make the picture even bigger, but since i wanted an even greater spread of sound, we Used 'six-track-stereophonic' sound and then combined it with a larger screen
