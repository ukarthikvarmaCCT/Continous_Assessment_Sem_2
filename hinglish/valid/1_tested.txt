 vah likhte hai: "quran saboot ke bina anumaan lagane ke khatre par dhyaan khinchataa he gyaan nahin kiya he 


 17:36) or kai alag-alag chhandon main musalamaanon se poochta he pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa ke liye, to saboot kii aavashyaktaa he, donon dharmik vishwaas or prakritik vigyaan main

 Ziauddin Sardar made a case for Muslims to develop the foundations of modern science in order to pay attention and reflect on the natural phenomena that the Quran repeatedly calls for
 bhautik vigyaani abdus salaam ne apane nobel puraskaar bhoj pate main quran kii ek prasiddh kavita uddhrut kii or phir kaha: "yah prabhaav sabhi bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he: jitna gaharaa ham chaahate hai, utana hi adhik hamaare aashcharya utsahit, hamaare nazar kaa chamak he "
 One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and discoveries that science tells humanity about nature and the universe
 salaam ne yah bhi raay rakhi ki quran or adhyayan or tarksangat pratibimb kii islamic bhaavana asaadhaaran sabhyataa ke vikaas kaa strot thi
 Salaam, in particular, used Ibn al-haytham and al-biruni as pioneers of the empiricist who introduced the experimental approach, breaking with Aristotle's influence and thus giving rise to modern science

 The message of the Quran is conveyed with various literary structures and devices
 mul arabi main, surya or chand dhvanyatmak or vishaygat sanrachanaon ko niojit karte hai jo paath ke sandesh ko yaad karne ke liye darshakon ke prayaason main sahaayta karte hai
 Muslims insist that the content and style of the Quran are inappropriate
 quran kii bhashaa ko "kavita gadhy" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he kyonki yah kavita or gadhy donon kaa hissaa he; haalanki, yah vivaran kuranik bhashaa kii layaaddh gunvattta ko vyakt karne main vifal hone kaa jokhim chalaata he, jo kuch hisson main adhik kavy he or dusron main adhik gadhy jaisaa he
 The Quran, while found throughout the Quran, is typical of many earlier Mecca Suras, in which relatively few verses throw singing words into prominence
 is tarah ke rup kii prabhaavashiltaa udhaaharan ke liye sura 81 main spasht he, or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki in margon ne shrotaaon ke vivek ko prabhavit kiya
 a change of verse from one set of verses to another signal is often a change in the subject of discussion
 baad ke khand bhi is form ko sangrakshit karte hai lekin style adhik expogitary he
 The Quranic text has no beginning, middle or end, its nonlinear structure is similar to a web or net
 paathyacharya vyavastha ko kabhi-kabhi nirantarata kii kami, kisi bhi kalkram yaa vishaygat kram or doharaav kii anupasthiti ko pradarshit karne ke liye mana jaataa he

 Selling also addresses the recurrence of much discussion of the Quran, also seeing it as a literary device
 ek paath aatm-sanderbhit hota he jab yah swayan ke bare main bolta he or khud ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Stephen Wilde, the Quran illustrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted
 un anuchhedon main aatm- refrencielity spasht he jahaan quran swayan ko ek aatmanirbhar tareeke se, samachar, maandand ke rup main swayan ko prakat karne ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 There is a blessed remembrance that we sent down, so are you rejecting it now? "), Or in the frequent presence of the" say "tag, when Muhammad is ordered to speak
 junglee ke anusaar quran atyadhik aatm-sanderbhit he
 This feature is more pronounced in early Mecca Suras
 mukhya lekh: tafasir The Quran has sparked a vast body of commentary and interpretation intended to explain the meanings of Quranic verses, clarify their import, and unravel their significance
 tafaseer musalamaanon kii sabase shuruaati shaikshanik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person to describe the meanings of verses for early Muslims
 anya shuruaati nikaayon main mohammad ke kuch saathi shaamil the, jaise ' ali ebn abi talib ,' abdulla ebn abbaas, abdulla ebn umr or ubey ebn kaab 
 In those days exegesis was limited to the literary aspects of the poem, the background of its publication and, sometimes, the explanation of the interpretation of one poem with the help of another
 yadi kavita ek aitihaasik ghatana ke bare main thi, to kabhi-kabhi mohammad kii kuch paramparaon ko iskaa arth spasht karne ke liye varnit kiya gaya tha
 Since the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the latter did not convert to Islam, they did not always understand Quranic Arabic, they did not catch Muslims who were fluent in Arabic of Muslims and were concerned with settling subjects in the Quran
 Clear struggle of
 arabi main tippanee karne vaale tippaneekaron ne sanketon ko samajhaayaa, or shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah samajhaayaa ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke karier main quran ke chhandon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya tha, jo ki sabase shuruaati muslim samudaay ke liye upyukt tha, or jise baad main prakat kiya gaya tha, radd karnaa yaa " nirast karnaa " nasakh ) pehle ke paath 
 However, other scholars say that there is no repeal in the Quran
 ahmadiya muslim samudaay ne quran par das khand vaali urdu tippanee prakashit kii he, jiskaa naam tafaseer i kabir he 
 The esoteric interpretation or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meaning of the Quran
 sufiwaad chhandon ke spasht bindu se aage badhata he or iske bajaay quran ke chand ko aantarik yaa gudh or chetana or astitv ke aadhyatmik ayaamon se sambandhit karata he
 According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are indicative rather than explanatory
 ve sambhaavnaaon ko ingit karte hai jitna ki ve prayek lekhak kii antardrushti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keller, is also an example of the use of the subject of love, for example in the Qur'anic interpretation of the Quran
 quran 7: 143 kahata he: When Moses came at the time when we appointed, and his Allah spoke to him, he said, 'my Allah, show me yourself! let me see you!' He said, 'you won't see me, but look at that mountain, if it stays strong you will see me
 ' jab uske bhagwaan ne pahaad par khud ko prakat kiya, to usne ise kharaab kar diya
 Moses fainted
 jab vah thik ho gaya, usne kaha, 'jai ho! main tumse pashchaatap karata hoon! main vishwaas karne vaala pehla vyakti hum! In 7: 143 Moses, the way of those who are in love, comes asking for a vision but his will is denied, he is commanded to see other than the mountain, while the mountain is able to see God
 
 parvat par bhagwaan ke prakat hone kii drushti se parvat chur or musa behosh hojaate hai
 In the words of Kushayari, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and Moses of Moses had nothing left
 khud se unmoolan kii sthiti main, musa ko vaastaviktaaon kaa anaavaran diya gaya tha
 From a Sufi point of view, God always causes the will and suffering of the beloved and the wayfarer to realize the truth
 mohammad hossain taababatei kehete hai ki baad ke utthanon ke bich lokapriy spashtikaran ke anusaar, tavil kaa arth he ki ek kavita kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 The meaning of revelation, as opposed to Tawal, is clear according to the explicit meaning of the words, as they were told
 lekin yah spashtikaran itnaa vyapak ho gaya he ki, vartmaan main, yah tavil kaa praathmik arth ban gaya he, jiskaa mul rup se "vaapasi karne" yaa "vaapasi sthaan" kaa arth tha
 In Tabatai's view, what is called taiwil or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran is not concerned with the signification of words
 iske bajaay, yah kuch sachai or vaastaviktaaon se sambandhit he jo purushon ke saamaanya bhaag kii samaj se pare he; phir bhi yah in satyon or vaastaviktaaon se he ki siddhant ke siddhant or quran ke vyaavhaarik nishedh jari hai
 Interpretation is not the meaning of the poem but it is transparent in a particular type of transit through that meaning
 ek aadhyatmik vaastaviktaa he- jo ek kanoon kaa paalan karne kaa mukhya uddeshy he, yaa divine gun kaa varnan karne kaa mul uddeshy he- or phir ek vaastavik mahatv he ki ek quran kii kahani kaa sandarbh he
 According to Shia beliefs, which are strongly rooted in knowledge such as Muhammad and Imams, know the mysteries of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, bayaan "koi bhi bhagwaan ko chhodkar isaki vyakhya ko jaanata he" kisi bhi virdohi yaa yogyata khand ke bina maanya rahata he
 Therefore, as far as this verse is concerned, knowledge of Quranic interpretation is reserved for God
 lekin Tabatabaei anya chhandon kaa upyog karata he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki jo log bhagwaan dwaara shuddh hai quran kii vyakhya kuch had tak pataa he
 According to Tabatai, there are esoteric interpretations that are acceptable and unacceptable
 sweekaarya ta'vil apane shabdic arth se pare ek kavita ke arth ko sanderbhit karata he; balki antarnihit arth, jo antat keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he or akele maanav vichaaron ke madhyam se sidhe samajha nahin ja saktaa he
 The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, contentment, anger, and sorrow, which are clearly attributed to God
 asweekaarya ta'wil vah he jahaan ek saboot ke madhyam se ek alag arth ke liye ek kavita kaa spasht arth "sthanantarit" hota he; yah vidhi spasht visangatiyon ke bina nahin he
 Although this unacceptable Ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to Quranic verses
 sahi vyakhya yah he ki vaastaviktaa ek kavita ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is found in all verses, decisive and ambiguous alike; This is not the meaning of the word; It is a fact that it is too fantastic for words
 bhagwaan ne unhen apane dimag main thodaa sa laane ke liye shabdon ke saath taiyaar kiya he; is sambandh main ve kahaniyon kii tarah hai jinka upyog dimag main ek tasviir banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or is prakaar shrota ko spasht rup se icchit vichaar ko samajhane main madad milti he
 One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation before the 12th century is Sulami whose work would not have been preserved without most of the early Sufi commentaries
 sulaami kii pramukh tippanee hekik al-tafaseer kii ek pustak he jo pehle sufi kii tippaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Several other works, including commentaries from Kushayari, Dayalam, Shirazi and Suhrawardy, emerged from the 11th century
 in kaaryon main sulaami kii kitabon or lekhak ke yogadan se saamagree shaamil he
 Many works have been written in Persian such as the works of Mabri Kashf al-asrar
 rumi ne apni pustak mathnavi main vishaal rahasyamay kavita likhi thi
 Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in the translation of Rumi's work
 mathnavi main badi sankhya main kuranik maarg paae ja sakate hai, jinamein se kuch quran kii ek sufi vyakhya par vichaar karte hai
 Rumi's book is not exceptional for quotations and elaborations on the Quran, however, Rumi mentions the Quran more often
 simnani ne quran par gudh exegesis ke do prabhaavshaalee kaaryon ko likhaa tha
 He reconciled the sentiments of Sunni Islam with the ideas and manifestations of God in the material world
 18 veen shatabdi main ismail haaki bursavi ke kaam jaise vyapak sufi tippaniyan dikhaai detii hai
 His work Ruh al-bayan is a huge marifat
 arabi main likhaa gaya he, yah lekhak ke apane vichaaron ko unke purvavartiyon ke saath jodta he
 Unlike the Salafis and Zahiri, the Shia and Sufis as well as some other Muslim philosophers believe that the meaning of the Quran is not limited to the literal aspect
 unke liye, yah ek aavashyak vichaar he ki quran main bhi aantarik pahalu hai
 Henry Corbin describes a hadith that goes back to Muhammad: quran main bahari upasthiti or ek chhipi gaharaai, ek asaadhaaran arth or ek gudh arth he
 This esoteric meaning in turn hides an esoteric meaning
 to yah saat gudh arthon ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 According to this view, it has also become clear that the internal meaning of the Quran does not eliminate or invalidate its external meaning
 iske bajaay, yah aatma kii tarah he, jo sharir ko jivan detaa he
 Corbin considers the Quran to play a role in Islamic philosophy, as nanology itself goes hand in hand with the prophet
 paath ke zahir se nipatane vaali tippaniyon ko tafaseer kaha jaataa he, or batin se nipatane vaali harmenetic or gudh tippaniyon ko tavil, jisamen paath ko isaki shuruyaat main waapas lenaa shaamil he
 Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God
 iske vipareet, kuranik shabdikta, iske baad salaphis or jahiris, yah vishwaas he ki quran ko keval iske spasht arth main hi liya janaa chahie
 The reenactment is the name of the hermeneutic style of some former Muslims who converted to Christianity
 unki style yaa punrariti vigyaapan or gaiyr-vyavasthit he or maafee maangane kii disha main taiyaar he
 This tradition of interpretation is based on the following practices: grammatical rethinking, curriculum preference, retrieval, and rethinking concession
 mukhya lekh: quran anuwadyah bhi dekhen: quran ke anuwaadon kii suchikuran kaa anuwaad hameshaa samasyagrast or kathin rahaa he
 Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in any other language or form
 iske alaava, ek arabi shabd ke sandarbh ke aadhaar par kai arth ho sakate hai, sateek anuwaad ko or bhi kathin banaate hai
 Nevertheless, the Quran has been translated into most African, Asian and European languages

 In the 12th century, the Quran was translated into Persian by Najm al-din Abu Hafs al-nasafi

 It can be said that this discipline studies the rules and methods of proper recitation of the Quran and three main areas: proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels, rules of pause in recitation and restoration of recitation, and musical and melodic features of the text

 quran kii bhashaa thi samaan karne ke liye siriek bhashaa
 The Quran recounts the stories of many people and events heard in Jewish and Christian sacred books and devotional literature, although it differs in many details

 In fact, Moses is mentioned more in the Quran than any other person
 mohammad kii tulana main quran main isa kaa aksar ullekh kiya gaya he, jabaki mariyam kaa ullekh quran main kiya gaaya he or engil main nahin
 Some non-muslim groups, such as the Bahá'ís and the Druूसs, regard the Quran as sacred
 unitian universalist bhi quran se prerana lete hai
 Summaries of books such as Dietesiron, James's Protévangelin, Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Sudo Matthews bear similarities to the Quran
 ek vidwaan ne suzav diya he ki ek susamachar sadbhaav ke rup main diateceron ne is dharna ko janm diya hoga ki isai susamachar ek paath he
 After the Quran's incarnation, and the general rise of Islam, the Arabic alphabet rapidly developed into an art form
 chicago vishvavidhyalay main paas purvi bhashaaon or sabhyataaon ke professor vadaad kaadi, or yangstown state uniwarsity main islamic adhyayan ke professor mustasir mir, ke mutabik: The main areas in which the Quran made a noticeable impact on Arabic literature are dictionaries and themes; Other areas relate to the literary aspects of the Quran, especially oaths, metaphors, allegories and symbols

 The Quran has not only created an entirely new linguistic corpus to convey its message, but it also endorses older, pre-islamic words with older meanings and it is those meanings that are in the language and later i take roots in literature


 allaah ne is dharti par manushya ko apana caliph banaakar bheja he
 Before sending, he had properly explained to every person that they are going to earth for a short time, after that they have to return to him

 But with this freedom, God arranged for the divine commands to be given to the human beings on the earth to live life exactly in that form, and he sent his messengers to every part of the earth, who sent the message of God to humans
 kaha jaataa he ki aise ishdooton kii sankhya 1,84,000 ke qareeb rahi
 Hazrat Muhammad was the final link in this connection
 aap ke baad ab koi doot nahin aayega kintu hazarat isa apane jivan ke shesh varsh is dharti par pun: guzaarenge
 The last book of God is in your hand, no other divine book will come now

 Because of the passage of thousands of years, in the divine orders, human beings would add their thoughts, their convenience and create a new religion and distort the original religion and create a monstrosity and many times work against the divine orders
 kyon ki har prabhavi vyakti apni shakti ke aage sab ko natmastak dekhnaa chahta tha
 After all, the last prophet Hazrat Muhammad came to this earth with the Quran and the Quran came with the challenge of God that God himself would protect it
 1500 varsh kaa lambaa samay yah bataata he ki koran virodhiyon ke saare prayaason ke baad bhi koran ke ek shabd main bhi parivartan sambhav nahin ho sakaa he

 iske saath koran kaa yah chalange bhi apane sthaan par abhi tak qaayam he ki jo ise ishwariya granth nahin maanate hon to ve is jaisi puri kitaab nahin uskaa ek chota bhaag hi bana kar dikhaa den
 Knowing this form of the Qur'an, it should be known that this book was not given to Hazrat Muhammad in the form of reading it to the people and printed and put it in every house
 balki samay samay par 23 varshon tak aavashyaktaa anusaar yah kitaab avatarit hui or aap ne ishwar kii marzi se uske adeshon ke anusaar dharti par vah samaaj banaaya jaisaa ishwar kaa aadesh tha
 According to the western thinker HG Wells, discourses were given a lot on this earth, but on the basis of those discourses a society was first created by Hazrat Muhammad

 ek uljhan or saamne aati he
 According to the Quran's claim that he is for the people of the whole earth and for the rest of the time, but the Arabs of that time appear to be addressed to him
 sarsari taur par yahi lagata he ki koran us samay ke arabon ke liye hi avatarit kiya gaya tha lekin aap jab bhi kisi aise sthaan par pahunchein jab yah lage ki yah baat keval ek khaas kaal tathaa desh ke liye he, tab vahaan ruuk kar vichaar karen yaa ise note karke baad main is par vichaar karen to aap ko har baar lagegaa ki manushya har yug or har bhu bhaag kaa ek he or us par vah baat thik waisi hi lagu hoti he, jaisi us samay ke log|arabon par lagu hoti thi
 Great books have been written and can be written in relation to the Quran for Muslims
 yahaan u¬ddeshy koran kaa ek sankshipt parichay or uske ummat par kya haq hai, yaha spasht karnaa he
 There is a hadith recited from Hazrat Ali
 hazarat haaris faramaate hai ki main masjid main daakhil hua to dekha ki kuch log kuch samasyaon main jhagada kar rahe hai
 i went to Hazrat Ali and informed him
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- kya yah baaten hone lageen? maine kaha, ji haa
 Hazrat Ali ordered- Remember i have heard from Rasul Allah
 aap ne farmaaya- khabardaar raho nikat hi ek bada fitanaa sar uthayega maine arz kiya- is fitane main nijaat kaa zariyaa kya hoga? farmaaya-allaah kii kitaab
 The entire squeeze of the Quran comes in this one hadith
 koran dharti par allaah kii antim kitaab uski khyaati ke anuroop he
 It is very easy and it is also very difficult
 aasaan yah tab he jab ise yaad karne ke liye padhaa jaae
 If you do not fail in your destiny and want instruction from the Quran, then Allah has made this book easy
 samajhane or yaad karne ke liye yah vishwa kii sabase aasaan kitaab he
 It is in the Qur'an itself 'and we have made it easy to understand the Qur'an, so is there anyone to think and understand?' In the same way, there are many more

 The world is progressing continuously, human knowledge is increasing continuously, which was defunct yesterday in the Quran, today it has become clear, and tomorrow some parts of it will be clear

 In the Qur'an in terms of orders, the contemplator must travel backwards

 ) And what did Sahaba mean by this
 yahaan tak ki khud ko hazarat mohammad ke qadamon tak pahunchaa de ki khud sahabe koran kaa is bare main kya aadesh tha? On the other hand, in terms of knowledge, it has to be considered further and continuously forward

 The surface of human knowledge is constantly increasing
 koran main vigyaan kaa sarvocch str he us par vichaar kar nae avishkaar, khoj or jo vaigyanik tathy hai un par kaary kiya ja saktaa he
 Mouzaza refers to a miracle that is on the hands of a prophet or Rasul and is beyond human power, to which the human intellect is shocked
 In every age, whenever any Rasul reached the divine orders of man, miracles were given to him by Allah
 hazarat musa ko asa di gai, jisase kai chamatkaar dikhaae gayi
 Hazrat Isa was given the opportunity to resurrect the dead, to heal the sick
 kisi bhi nabi kaa asal muajaza vah he jise vah daawey ke saath pesh kare
 Hundreds of Mojaz are described on the hand of Hazrat Muhammad, but the claim which is presented with the claim and which is still present to the world as a miracle, is the Qur'an which this disciple of the world is unanswered
 Be made as shown
 yah daawa koran main kai sthaan par kiya gaya
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran purna rup se surakshit rahegaa, is daawey ko 1500 varsh biit gaye or koran surakshit he, purna surakshit he
 This has been proven, which is a miracle
 The Qur'an has stood the test of science, and its scientific narratives are preceded by scientific efforts
 yah bhi ek chamatkaar he
 1500 years ago in the Arabian desert, an illiterate person presented a book that showed its truth in front of all the instruments of the twentieth century
 yah kaary koran ke atirikt kisi anya kitaab ne kiya ho to vishwa uskaa naam jaananaa chahega
 This miraculous form of the Qur'an is for us today and may be another miraculous form of it for the time to come
 jis samay koran avtarit hua us yug main uskaa mukhya chamatkaar uskaa vaigyanik aadhaar nahin tha
 The miracle of the Quran in that era was its language, literature, eloquence, which shook the language knowledge of the Arabs of its time
 yahaan spasht karnaa uchit hoga ki us samay ke arabon ko apane bhashaa gyaan par itnaa garv tha ki ve shesh vishwa ke logon ko ajami kehete the
 Due to the style of the Qur'an, the Arabic linguists fell on their knees
 koran aisi kitaab he jiske aadhaar par ek kranti laai gai
 Such illiterate people of the desert who had no importance in the world map at that time
 koran kii shikshaaon ke kaaran, uske prastutakarta kii training ne unhe us samay kii mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh laa khadaa kiya or ek aise korani samaaj kii rachana maatr 23 varshon main kii gai jiskaa uttar vishwa kabhi nahin de saktaa
 Even today, the world believes that the Quran and Hazrat Muhammad created an ideal society
 is drushti se yadi koran kaa adhyayan kiya jaae to aapako uske saath qadam mila kar chalanaa hoga
 Follow his education

 is bare main tiramizi main hazarat zayd bin araqam dwaara varnit haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki koran allaah kii rassi he jo zamin se asaman tak tani he
 The word is from Hazur, described by Hazrat Zaid
 There is another hadith mentioned in Tabrani, which states that one day when a person was brought to the Hazur Mosque, he saw some people reading the Quran sitting in a corner and explaining to each other
 yah dekh kar aap ke chehre par khushi kii lahar daud gai
 You reached that group of Sahaba and said to them - Do you believe that there is no other Mabud except Allah, i am the Messenger of Allah and the Quran is the book of Allah? Sahaba said, or Rasul Allah we testify that there is no Mabud except Allah, you are the Rasool of Allah and the Quran is the Book of Allah
 tab aapane kaha, khushiyaan manaao ki koran allaah kii vah rassi he jiskaa ek sira uske haath main he or doosraa tumhaare haath main
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran allaah kii rassi is arth main bhi he ki yah musalamaanon ko aapas main baandh kar rakhata he
 The unity of ideas in them, at the time of differentiation, presents a perfect model for judgment and life by the orders of Allah
 It is in the Qur'an itself to hold the rope of Allah firmly
 koran ke mul aadhaar par musalamaanon ke kisi gut main koi takaraav nahin he
 The Right to the Qur'an has five rights on every Muslim of the Qur'an, which he should fulfill according to his power and ability
 koran ko samajhane ke liye uske avateern kii prishth bhoomi jaananaa zaruri he
 This is not the kind of book that has been written in full and given to the Prophet that he should go and call people
 balki koran thodaa thodaa us kranti ke avasar par jo hazarat mohammad ne arab main aarambh kii thi, aavashyaktaa ke anusaar avatarit kiya gaya
 From the beginning, as soon as some part of the Qur'an descended, you would write it down and also tell with whom it would be read
 avateern ke kram se vidwaanon ne koran ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the Makki portion, the other the Madni part

 After this, the people who occupied the political and economic power of Mecca, sensed this danger for themselves, that they had to leave their homes and die in the small number of Muslims
 khud nabi ko ek ghati main saare parivarajanon ke saath qaid rahanaa padaa or ant main makka chhod kar madina janaa padaa
 This was a very tough time for the Muslims and the Qur'an revealed by Allah at this time was the cutting of the sword and the speed of the flood
 jisane puraa kshaitra hilaa kar rakh diya
 There are consolations for Muslims and prayers during this difficult time, which was the main part of this eight-year Quran
 is hinsaatmak prakaran se spasht hota he ki maanviya rachanadharmita evam bhaawanaaon kaa prabhaav is granth kii rachana main rahaa
 Thirteen years after the Makki era, Muslims found a center in Medina
 jahaan saare imaan laane waalon ko ekatrit kar tisare daur kaa avateern shuru hua
 Here Muslims were introduced to two new types of people
 pratham yahudee jo yahan sadiyon se aabaad the or apane dharmik vishwaas ke anusaar antim nabi kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 But when he saw the last prophet in his second demise, he created a ruckus
 koran main is daur main ahale kitaab par koran main sakht tippaniyan kii gayi
 In this era, a group of malicious people was born among the Muslims who pretended to be Muslims and kept meeting their opponents
 yaheen musalamaanon ko sashastr sangharsh kii ajna mili or unhen nirantar makka vaasiyon ke hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, with the establishment of an Islamic state, the divine rules were created for the creation of the whole society
 yudhd, shanti, nyaay, samaajik reeti rivaaj, khan paan sabake bare main ishwar ke aadesh is yug ke koran kii visheshta hai
 On the basis of which Rasul of Allah created an ideal state of social equality

 He did not give verbal instructions in every field of life, but showed it by following it

 Monotheism, religious order, heaven, hell, patience, religion are subjects of perennialism that were repeated again and again

 aise saikadon udhaaharan hai jinhe koran kii is tikaa main aap nirantar padhenge
 There is a difference of opinion that when the Qur'an is such a siddha book, why do scholars differ from Hazrat Muhammad in his commentary so far
 yahaan itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki paigambar mohammad ne apane anuyaayiyon main sehatmand vibhed ko badhaava diya kintu matbhinnata ke aadhaar par kattarpan or gutbandi ko aapane pasand nahin kiya

 The literal verse Qur'an descended on Hazrat Muhammad, in divine words
 yah vahya shabdic he, arth ke rup main nahin
 This has to be clarified that in Christian educational institutions, it is taught that it is not in divine words but on the heart of the prophet that he describes it in his own words
 isaiyon ke liye yah vishwaas isliye zaruri he ki bibil main jo badlaav unhone kiye hai, use ve isi prakaar satya bataa sakate the

 Pits and cracks are structural marks on the tooth from which enamel turns inward
 daraaron kaa nirmaan khaanchon ke vikaas ke dauraan hota he, lekin us sthaan par sthit dantabalk puri tarah judaa hua nahin hota
 As a result, a deep linear crater is formed on the enamel's surface structure, which provides a place for dental caries to develop and thrive
 daraaren adhikanshtah pasch daanton kii samrodhak sataha or jambhika par sthit agr daanton kii talvya sataha par sthit hoti hai
 The pits are small, needle-shaped holes, found mostly at the ends or transverse sections of the grooves
 vishisht rup se, charvnak daanton kii bahari satahon par kapol gadde paae jate hai
 For all types of pits and crevices, the highly enamel-folded enamel makes it difficult to maintain oral health care on these surfaces, causing dental damage to develop in these areas is more common

 As caries increases, enamel decay near the tooth surface begins to progressively increase in depth
 ek baar jab yah kshay dant-utak or dantabalk ke sangyojan-sthal ke dant-utak par pahunchataa he, to yah ksharan tezi se parshvik rup se failata he
 Within dentin, this erosion follows a triangular pattern, which is directed towards the tooth pulp
 ksharan ke is pattern kaa varnan vishisht rup se do tribhuj ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, jinke aadhaar diije par ek duusare se jude hote hai
 This base-to-base pattern is the typical pattern of erosion of a pit and crack, as opposed to erosion on a smooth surface

 Proximal caries, also known as interspersed caries, occur on the smooth surface between the proximal teeth

 Often this type of caries cannot be identified humanely by seeing or by a dental investigator
 Proximal caries form gravelly just below the point of contact of two teeth

 In Blake's classification system, proximal caries on posterior teeth are called category II caries
 agle daanton par hone vaale samipsth ksharan main yadi krintak chor shaamil na ho, to ise shrenee III main rakhaa jaataa he or yadi krintak chor shaamil ho, to ise shrenee IV main rakhte hai
 Original caries, sometimes described as a type of smooth-surfaced caries, are the third most common type of caries and usually occur when the original surfaces have been exposed to gingival subsidence
 
 If the gums are healthy, the development of root caries is unlikely because the bacterial plaque cannot reach the original surfaces
 The parent surfaces are more vulnerable to demineralization process than enamel because enamel begins to demineralize at ph 6
7, which is higher than enamel's delicate ph

 Under Blake's classification, erosion on gums located near anatomical or gingival surfaces is marked as Category V
 shrenee VI pashchasth daanton ke siron or agrastha daanton ke krintak chhoron ke liye arakshit he
 In addition to the two categories described earlier, caries injury can also be described by their position on a specific surface of a tooth
 daant kii jo sataha gaalon yaa hothon se sabase nikat hoti he, un par hone vaale ksharan ko “ananmukh ksharan kaha jaataa he or jeebh kii ore sthit sataha par hone vaala ksharan, jiheey ksharan kehalaata he
 Erosive caries is further called cupola and bracket

 Rodent caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the anterior teeth
 ksharanon kaa varnan “madhyam " athwa "duurastha " ke rup main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Moderate caries refers to a location on the teeth that is closest to the midline of the face, which is located on the vertical axis between the eyes down to the nose and the middle rodent's contact
 madhya rekha se dur sthit daanton kii sthiti kaa varnan duurastha ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 In some instances, the damage is also described in some other way, indicating its cause
 “shishu bottle ksharan”, “praarambhik shishav ksharan” athwa “shishu bottle daant ksharan” asthaayee daanton vaale chote bacchon main paaya jane vaala ek pattern he
 It is most likely to affect the teeth located on the anterior part of the jaw, but all teeth can be affected

 Another pattern of caries is "highly diffuse caries", which indicates advanced or excessive caries on multiple surfaces of multiple teeth

 Dr
 Miller stated in 1887 that "dental caries is a chemical-parasitic process, which consists of two stages - enamel denervation, resulting in complete destruction, and enamel tissue as the primary stage, followed by The residual solution of the softened residue occurs
 " apni is pariklpana main, dow miller ne teen karkon ko aavashyak bhoomikaayen aavantit kin: To inform the progress rate and past history of caries, temporary details can be applied to them

 Paused caries describes an injury on a tooth that has previously been demineralized, but which has been re-privatized before a perforation has occurred
 fluoride upachaar kaa prayog karnaa punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Depending on the tissue that is affected, it is possible to describe caries as enamel, dentin, or dentinal caries
 apane vikaas ke prarambh main, ksharan dwaara keval dantabalk ko prabhavit kiya janaa sambhav he
 Once the expansion of caries reaches the deep layer of dentin, the term "dentin caries" is used
 chunki cementem daanton kii jadon ko dhankane vaala sakht utak he, atah saamanytah yah kshay dwaara tab tak prabhavit nahin hota, jab tak ki daant kii jaden munh main ujagar na ho rahi hon

 The roots have a very thin layer of cementum on top of a large layer of dentin and thus most caries affecting dentin also affect dentin
 yah sambhav he ki ksharan kaa anubhav kar rahe vyakti ko isaki jaankaree na ho
 The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is in the form of a chapped white patches on the tooth surface, indicating that enamel is demineralized in that area
 ise praarambhik kshay kaha jaataa he
 When demineralization of the wound continues, it can turn brown, but eventually it will turn into a coat
 Before the hole is formed, this process is reversible, but once the hole is formed, the damaged tooth structure cannot be regenerated
 Any lesion that appears brown and shiny indicates that dental caries was present at some point, but the demineralization process has stalled and only one scar remains

 When enamel and dentin are destroyed, this perforation becomes symptomatic
 daant ke prabhavit kshetra apana rang badal dete hai or chune par mulaayam mahasoos hote hai
 Once the caries passes through enamel, the tooth ducts, which have a passage leading to the vein of the tooth, are exposed, causing pain in the teeth

 Amelogenesis imperfecta, which occurs between 1 in 718 and one in 14,000 people, is a disease in which enamel is either not fully formed or is insufficiently formed and can fall out of the teeth

 In most individuals, the primary cause of dental caries is not teeth deformities or diseases
 Ninety-six percent of the tooth enamel is made up of minerals

 There is a higher risk of erosion in dentin and dentin than enamel because they contain less mineral content
 is prakaar, jab daant kii mul satahon kaa saamana masoodon main hone vaale gaddhon yaa masoodon se judi anya bimariyon se hota he, to ksharan jaldi viksit ho sakate hai
 However, even in a healthy oral environment, there is a risk of tooth decay
 daanton kii sanrachana ksharan ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Where the deep grooves of teeth are more numerous and exaggerated, there is a greater possibility of development of pits and cracks
 saath hi, yadi daanton ke bich ann-kan dabe hue hon, to ksharan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Many types of oral bacteria are found in our mouths, but it is believed that only a few specific species of those bacteria are responsible for tooth decay, including Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli
 lactobacilas acedophilas, actinomices viscosas, nocardia esapeepi
 or stryptococas mutans kaa danta-kshay, visheshtah danta-mul main hone vaale kshay, ke saath nikat sambandh hota he
 Bacteria around the teeth and gums accumulate in a viscous, cream-like substance called plaque, which acts as a bio-covering
 kuch vishisht sthanon par plak kaa ekatra hona anya sthanon kii tulana main aam hota he
 Like the point of contact between teeth, the grooves found on the chewing surfaces of the molars and forearm teeth also provide microscopic occlusion
 masoodon par plak bhi ekatrit ho saktaa he
 Bacteria present in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, and most commonly sucrose into acids such as lactic acid, etc
 through a glycolytic process called fermentation
 yadi in amlon ko daant ke sampark main chhod diya jaae, to ve akhanijeekaran kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, jo ki khanijon ke vilyan kii prakriya he
 However this process is kinetic because remineralization can also occur if this acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash

 If demineralization continues for a long time, such a large amount of mineral-content may be lost that the remaining soft biomass decomposes, forming a coat or hole
 aisi sharkaraaon dwaara danta ksharan ke vikaas par daale jane vaale prabhaav ko ksharanakarita kehete hai
 Although sugars are a bound glucose and fructose unit, they are actually more corrosive than a mixture of equal amounts of glucose and fructose
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jeevanu glucose va fructose kii up-ikaayiyon ke bich upasthit bandha se urja praapt karte hai

 by converting sucrose into a highly viscous substance called dexran polysaccharide by enzyme dextransucranase
 Mutans stick to the bio-layer positioned on the tooth
 ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna is baat se bhi prabhavit hoti he ki daant kis aavriti par ksharankari vaataavaranon ke sampark main aate hai
 After a meal or snack, bacteria present in the mouth metabolize sugars, resulting in the formation of an acidic by-product that lowers the ph

 During each contact with the acidic environment, some part of the non-organic material present on the surface of the teeth disintegrates and can remain decomposed for two hours

 jab masoode kaa daanton se judaav khatm ho jaataa he, to mul sataha munh main adhik darshneey ho jaati he
 If this happens, basic caries is a worrying factor because the dentin that covers the teeth is demineralized by acids more easily than enamel

 Enamel is a highly mineralized acellular tissue and is damaged by a chemical process initiated by caries bacteria
 jab ye jeevanu sharkara kaa seven karne lagate hai or iskaa prayog apni swayan kii urja ke liye karne lagate hai, tab ve lactic amla utpann karte hai
 The effects of this process include demineralization of the particles present in enamel, which is caused by the passage of time as well as acids and continues until bacteria physically penetrate the dentin
 Enamel rods, which are the basic units of enamel structure, are located perpendicularly from the tooth surface to the dentin
 chunki ksharan ke dwaara dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran saamanytah dantabalk kii chad kii disha main hi hota he, atah dantabalk main gaddhon va chhidron ke bich bhinn-bhinn tribhujaakar pattern tathaa chikani-sataha vaale ksharan viksit hote hai ki daant ke do kshetron main dantabalk kii chhadon kii sthiti bhinn-bhinn hoti he
 When enamel loses its minerals and dental caries begins to develop, many clear areas develop in enamel, which can be seen with a light microscope

 duusari ore, puure jivan-kaal ke dauraan odontoblast ke dwaara dant-utak utpaadit hota rahata he, jo goode or dant-utak ke bich sthit hota he
 Since odontoblasts are present, a catalyst, such as corrosion, can initiate a biological reaction
 in suraksha karypranaliyon main shwetapatli va tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan shaamil hota he
 In dentin located from the deepest layer to enamel, the areas affected by corrosion are the area of translocation, area of destruction, and area of bacterial perforation
 parbhasi kshetra kshati kii prakriya kii aage badhati suchi kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or yah vahaan sthit hota he, jahaan praarambhik akhanijeekaran kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Areas of bacterial perforation and destruction are areas of invading bacteria and ultimately disintegration of dentin

 The diameter of dentinal tubules is more near the pulp and the lowest at the placenta of dentin and enamel
 kshati-prakriya puri dant-utak nalikaaon par jari rahati he, jo ki daant main gaharaai tak ksharan ke vikaas ke parinamswaroop utpann tribhujaakar pattern ke liye zimmedaar hoti hai
 The ducts also allow caries to develop rapidly

 At the same time, the mineralization of nearby tubes also increases
 iskaa parinaam nalikaaon ke nirmaan ke rup main miltaa he, jo ki jeevanvik pragati kii gati ko kam karne kaa ek prayaas he
 Additionally, when bacterial acids demineralize the hydroxyapatite particles, calcium and phosphorus are released, allowing a greater number of particles to penetrate deeper into the dentinal tubules
 ye kan ek avrodh kaa nirmaan karte hai or ksharan ke vistaar ko dhimaa karte hai
 Following these protective responses, dentin is considered to be whitish
 aisa mana jaataa he dant-utak kii nalikaaon ke bheetar upasthit dravon ke kaaran daant ke goode ke bheetar sthit dard abhigrahi sakriy ho jate hai
 Since the white dentin blocks the flow of such fluids, it is possible that the pain that would have warned of the invasion of bacteria may not have occurred before
 iske parinamswaroop, daant kii kisi bhi samvedansheeltaa ke bina danta ksharan ek lambey samay tak pragati karata rah saktaa he, jisase daant kii sanrachana kii bahut adhik haani ho sakati he
 In response to dental caries, more dentin may be produced in the pulp direction
 is nae dant-utak kaa ullekh tritiyak dant-utak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Tertiary dentin is produced to protect the pulp from the advancing bacteria as much as possible
 jab adhik tritiyak dant-utak utpann ho jaataa he, to goode kaa aakaar ghat jaataa he
 This type of dentin is subclassified according to the presence or absence of the original odontoblast
 yadi odontoblast itane adhik samay tak batch jate hai ki ve danta kshay ke prati pratikriya de saken, to is sthiti main utpann dant-utak ko “pratikriyaatmak " dant-utak kehete hai
 If odontoblasts are destroyed, the dentin produced in this condition is called "rectal" dentin
 sudhaarak dant-utak kii sthiti main, nasht ho chuke odontoblast kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye anya utakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is believed that growth factors, especially tgf-beta, initiate the formation of rectal dentin by pulmonary fibroblasts and mesenchymal tissues

 The resulting dentin consists of irregularly shaped dentinal tubules and may not line up with pre-existing dentinal tubules
 This reduces the ability of dental caries to progress within the dentin tubules

 Dental radiographs may show dental caries, especially caries between the teeth, before being visible in any other way
 bade danta ksharan aksar nangi ankhon se dekhe ja sakate hai, lekin chote ghaavon ko pahchaan paanaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Dentists use radiographic as well as visual and tactile inspection to detect erosion of pits and holes

 Since the process of damage can be returned by stopping the formation of the hole, it may be possible to prevent corrosion with fluoride and to reprogram the tooth surface
 jab ek chhidr upasthit ho, to daant kii kho chuki sanrachana ko badalane ke liye punarsthapana kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 At times, erosion of pits and holes can be difficult to identify

 These caries, sometimes called "hidden caries", can still be seen by X-ray radiographs, but visual examination of the tooth will show that enamel is intact or minimally perforated

 kshatigrast padaarth ke bade bhaagon ko daant se nikaalane ke liye ek danta handpis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 a spoon is a dental device that is carefully used to remove caries, and is sometimes used when caries in the dentin reaches near the pulp
 Once the caries is removed, the lost tooth structure needs some kind of dental restoration, to bring the tooth back to its functional and elegant condition
 punarsthapanaatmak padaarthon main danta sammishran, mishrit raal, chini-mitti or swarna shaamil hai
 Mixed resin and ceramic can be made in such a way that they look similar to the natural color of the patient's teeth and are often used when beauty is a concern

 When caries is very widespread, it is possible that the structure of the tooth does not have enough space to contain the restorative material within the tooth

 This restoration appears like a cap and is folded over the remaining top of the tooth

 In some specific conditions, endodontic treatment may be necessary to restore the tooth
 andodontic upachaar, jise “root kanal " bhi kaha jaataa he, ki anushansa tab kii jaati he, yadi daant main upasthit guda kshati-kaarak jeevanuon ke kaaran yaa chot ke kaaran nasht ho jaae
 root kanal ke dauraan, daant ke kshatigrast bhaag ke saath hi daant ke goode, nason va sanvahani utakon sahit, ko hataa diya jaataa he
 The ducts are cleaned and shaped by tools of endodontic files, then normally filled with rubber-like material, called gutta form
 daant ko bharaa jaataa he or isamen ek sheersh bhi joda ja saktaa he
 The tooth is now dead without the root canal being complete because it is devoid of any living tissue
 uchhedan bhi daanton ke ksharan kaa ek upachaar ho saktaa he
 The decision to remove a damaged tooth is made if the tooth has been damaged so much due to the degenerative process that it cannot be effectively restored
 kabhi-kabhi uchhedan par vichaar tab kiya jaataa he, yadi daant ke liye koi virdohi daant uplabdh na ho athwa jab isse bhavishya main aage koi samasya utpann ho sakati ho, jaisaa ki pragna-danta ke maamle main ho saktaa he
 Ablation may also be preferred in situations where the patient does not want to bear the expense or discomfort involved in tooth restoration
 vyaktigat swatchta dekhbhaal main pratidin thik se daant saaf karnaa or mulaayam dhaage se safai karnaa shaamil hai
 The purpose of oral hygiene is to reduce the presence of any genetic representative of the disease in the mouth
 daant saaf karne va mulaayam dhaage se safai karne kaa mukhya uddeshy plak ko hataanaa or iske nirmaan ko rokna hota he
 Mostly plaque contains bacteria

 a toothbrush can be used to remove plaque on accessible surfaces, but not between the teeth or inside the pits and crevices on chewing surfaces
 If used properly, dental floss can remove plaque from the places at which otherwise proximal caries may develop
 swatchta kii anya sahaayak vidhiyon main antardant brush, water pick or mouthwash shaamil hai
 However oral health is probably more effective in preventing gum diseases than dental caries

 For dental health, the frequency of sugar intake is more important than the amount of sugar consumed
 chini or anya carbohydrton kii upasthiti main, munh main sthit jeevanu aise amla utpann karte hai, jo dantabalk, dant-utak va dant-mul ko akhanijeekrut kar sakate hai
 The higher the frequency of bringing teeth into such an environment, the greater the likelihood of dental caries occurring
 Therefore, it is recommended to keep the amount of breakfast to a minimum because having breakfast provides a continuous supply of nutrition for the acid-making bacteria present in the mouth
 saath hi, bahut adhik chabaae jane vaale or chipchipe khaadya-padaarth lambey samay tak daanton par chipke rahete hai or parinamswaroop ve kisi bhojan ke ek bhaag ke rup main sabase acchhee tarah khaae jate hai

 Also, xylitol is widely used in chewing gum in some countries to protect teeth and is particularly popular in Finland's candy industry
 plak ko kam karne main zailitol sambhawatah isaliye prabhavi hota he kyonki jeevanu iskaa upyog anya sharkaraaon kii tarah kar paane main sakasham nahin hote

 The use of dental sealant is a means of prevention
 ek seelint ek patali plastic-numa parat hoti he, jise charvnak daaton kii chabane vaali satahon par lagaaya jaataa he
 This layer prevents food from getting trapped in pits and crevices within the grooves due to the pressure generated when chewing, so that the bacteria residing there are deprived of the carbohydrates they convert to acid demineralization and thus It prevents the formation of caries in pits and crevices, which are the most common form of dental caries
 bacchon ke daanton par seelint ko saamanytah charvnak daanton ke ugane ke kuch hi samay baad lagaaya jaataa he
 Older people can also benefit from dental sealants, but their dental history and the possibility of caries formation are generally considered
 danta ksharan se bachaav ke liye aksar doodh va hari subjiyon aadi jaise khaadya-padaarthon main milanevaale calcium kii anushansa kii jaati he
 It has been demonstrated that calcium and fluoride supplements reduce the incidence of dental caries
 dantabalk ke hydroxipetic kanon ko baandh kar fluoride daant ke kshay ko rokane main sahaayta karata he
 The incorporated calcium makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus to decay
 daant kii parat kii raksha ke liye fluoride ke samayik prayog kii bhi anushansa kii jaati he
 This may include fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash
 anek danta chikitsak niyamit jaanch ke ek bhaag ke rup main fluoride ke samayik prayog ko shaamil karte hai
 Other products, with little or little scientific evidence to support their efficacy in the context of regeneration, include DCPD, ACP, calcium compounds, fluorides, and enamelons
 punarkhanijeekaran kaa kaary danta chikitsak dwaara vyavsaayik rup se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, recent research has shown that low-intensity laser radiation of aragon ion lasers can prevent the possibility of enamel corrosion and white-mark corrosion

 Despite this, countries that have experienced a gross reduction in cases of dental caries also continue to have an asymmetry in the distribution of the disease
 sanyukt rajya america va europe ke bacchon kii baees pratishat jansankhya danta kshay ke kul maamalon ke saath se assi pratishat ko jhel rahi he
 a similar unequal distribution of the disease is seen throughout the world, with some children having zero or very little caries, while in other children it is very high
 australia, nepal or sweden main bacchon main danta kshay ke maamalon kii sankhya kam he, jabaki costa rika or slovakia main yah sankhya bahut adhik he
 The traditional "DMF") index is the most common method of estimating the prevalence of caries among people as well as the required dental treatment
 yah suchakank ek salaai, darpan va kapaas ke gole kaa prayog karte hue vyaktiyon ke vaastavik chikitsiya pareekshan par aadhaarit hota he
 Since the DMF index is produced without X-ray visualization, it underestimates the actual extent of the erosion and the treatment required

 In England, however, both types of physicians are included in the category of "anesthesia"
 This source states that the "anesthetist" is a specialist who attains proficiency in anesthesia after receiving initial medical education, through a recognized full-time program, which can normally be four years
 nishchetana paricharika vah paricharika he jise nishchetana dene ke liye vishesh rup se shikshit kiya jaataa he
 This education lasts for 2-3 years and is given after graduation

 The anesthetist can either anesthetize himself or form a group with a "anesthetic hostess" or "anesthetic assistant"

 It is the moral, fundamental and legal right of the patient to provide complete information to the patient before surgery
 iske uparaant hi uski sahmati upyukt maani gayi he
 The American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Osteopathic College of Anesthesiologists, and other professional institutions, such as the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, fully support the principle that the patient should be fully aware of how anesthesia is administered shalyakriya ke pehle, dauraan or baad main di jane vaali dawaaon ke prabhaav se kabhi kabhi aisa bhi ho saktaa he kii marij ko yah yaad na rahe kii usne nishchetak yaa uske samooh ke logon se kya baat kii thi
 Therefore, before the surgery the patient should show a desire to know who will give him anesthesia, anesthetist, anesthesia hostess or anesthesia assistant

 The real name of Kavindracharya, born in the Brahmin clan of the Rigvedic Assalan branch in a village on the arrow of Godavari in the south, is not known
 'kavindra' inaki oopaadhi he
 Being an Advaita Vedanti monk, he was conferred with the title 'saraswati' and was the most prominent monk of Prayag and Varanasi during the reign of Shah Jahan, and the monks of Pandavadarshan and Vedvedang
 kavindracharya saraswati ke mul naam ke sambandh main koi pramanik pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 They were originally residents of a city on the banks of the Godavari river in Maharashtra
 yah sthaan 'pratishthan' kaha gaya he
 Kavindracharya was a Rigvedic Brahmin of the Ashwaliyan branch
 baalyavastha main unhen sansaarik vishyon se virakti hui thi jiske parinamswaroop unhone bachapan hi main sanyasashram main pravesh kiya
 In the early days of his life, he had done a serious study of veda-vedang, poetry etc

 He had a huge monastery on the banks of Varuna
 math to sambhavat: inke brahmaleen hone ke baad hi yawanon ne dhwast kar diya, par vah sthaan aaj bhi 'vedanti kaa baag' ke naam se prasiddh he
 In this monastery, Kavindracharya had established a huge library, which had thousands of rare handwriting
 inamen se kai hastlekh aaj bhi baroda, puna tathaa landan ke pustakaalayon main uplabdh hai
 Some even go as far as signing the Mughal prince Dara Shikoh

 Later, he kept going to Agra from time to time
 shahjahan, daara shikoh or jahannaara ke sambandh main inhone brajabhasha main kavitaayen bhi likhi hai
 His mother tongue being Marathi, he composed compositions in Braj Bhasha besides Sanskrit
 sanskrit main inhone rugveda par bhashya likhaa tha
 He wrote a philosophical poem called 'hansdoot'

 dharamapi yaa galvanometer ek prakaar kaa ameter hi he
 It is used to detect the presence of current in a circuit
 praayah isapar ampear, volt yaa om ke nishaan nahin lagaaye gayi rahete hai
 Current senstivity-cs-nab \ ksi unit of current senstivity is Radian / Ampiar dharamapi kai prakaar ke ho sakate hai- The tangent brometer is the most simple and useful movable magnetometer
 isamen kisi achumbakeey padaarth ke urdhwadhar dhaanche par vidyutarodhi taanbe ke taar kii ek vrittakar kundali lagi rahati he
 The horoscope usually consists of 552 rounds, with connective screws after 2, 50 and 500 rounds
 inaki sahaayta se aavashyatanusaar kam yaa adhik chakkaron se kaam le sakate hai
 The circular coil can be rotated around the vertical axis
 kundali ke centre par ek chumbakeey sui urdhwadhar kilak par sadhi rahati he or sui ke lamberup ek aluminium kaa lanbaa sanketak laga rahata he, jo sooyee ke saath saath kshaitij vrittakar scale par ghumta he or chumbakeey sooyee kaa vikshep batalaata he
 The scale is divided into four quadrants and each quartile has signs ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees
 jab chumbakeey sooyee chumbakeey yamyottar main hoti he, to sanketak shunya ansh par rahata he
 Before measuring the current, you make the base of the dielectric horizontal and rotate the plane of the coil to the magnetic meridian
 is dasha main chumbakeey sui ke baks ko kundali ke centre par kshaijit sthiti main rakhte hai or yah bhi dekh lete hai ki sanketak ke donon sire 0 degree - 0 degree par sthit he ab dharamapi ke do sanyojak penchon ko us paripath main sambhddha kar dete hai jisamen dhara kaa pravaah hota he
 As the current flows in the vertical coil, a magnetic field is created, which forms a right angled horizontal earth magnetic field
 un donon chumbakeey kshetron ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee par do vipareet disha main ghumaanevaale balyugma kaary karte hai
 The needle is deflected and stops in such a situation where the rotations of both the balugams are equal
 yadi sooyee kaa vikshep q ho, to dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : That is, the current flowing in the currentometer is proportional to the tangent of the deflection angle
 niyatank dharamapi kaa parivartan gunak kehalaata he
 The change multiplier is measured in amperes
 yah us vidyutdhara ke baraabar hota he, jo dharamapi kii sooyee main 45 degree kaa vikshep utpann kar sakati he
 This type of simple tangent dormometer is not sufficiently subtle and accurate
 vishesh rup se dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata chumbakeey sui ke donon dhruvon par ek si nahin hoti
 This leads to an error in the current, because the formula relies on having the same magnetic field at both poles
 isliye isi siddhant par aadhaarit ek doosraa dharamapi bana, jise helmholts galavenometer kehete hai
 This is not an error in the currentometer and it is much more sensitive than a simple tangentometer
 isamen achumbakeey padaarth ke do urdhwadhar dhaanchon par vrittakar kundaliyaan hoti hai
 The distance between their centers is equal to their radius
 chumbakeey sooyee kaa baks donon kundiliyon ke kshaitij aksh par thik bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 The wires of both the coils are connected in such a way that the magnetic fields produced from both are in the same direction when current flows in them
 aisa hone se chumbakeey sooyee ke paas dharaa se utpann chumbakeey kshetra adhik teevr ho jaataa he or yah bhi siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki is kshetra kii tivrata sooyee ke donon siron par ek si rahati he
 As a result of this change, this thermometer becomes more sensitive and accurate
 dhara naapane ke pehle sooyee ke baks ke samtal ko kshaitij karnaa or urdhwadhar kundaliyon ko chumbakeey yamyottar main karnaa aavashyak he
 After this adjustment, when current flows in the coil of the dielectric and there is an angle deflection in the magnetic needle, the value of the current is known by the following formula: g ko helmholts dharamapi kaa pavirthan gunak kehete hai
 This thermometer is also not sufficiently sensitive
 adhik sookshmagrahi dharamapi banane ke liye ek nayaa siddhant prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 That is, if the effect of the earth magnetic field is reduced on the magnetic needle, then any current will cause the magnetic needle to have greater deflection than before, meaning the device will become more sensitive
 isko asthaitik yugma kaa siddhant kehete hai
 If two nearly equal magnetic rotating magnets are attached to a rigid rod so that they are parallel to each other and their opposite poles are close together, they are called an inertial pair
 is yugma main donon chumbakon ke vipareet dhruv paas paas hote hai, is kaaran parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav is yugma par bahut kam padataa he
 The coil or coils of the wire are wrapped around a magnet or both magnets in such a way that the currents are exerted on the magnets in the same direction
 is dasha main yadi kundaliyon main nune dhara bhi pravahit ha, ta bha chumbakeey yugma main adhik vikshep hota he
 This type of dielectric is very sensitive
 yadi is chumbakeey yugma ko ek anthnrahit latakan dwaara lataka diya jaae or is latakan main ek chota sa darpan laga diya jaae, to prakaash kiran dwaara ati sakshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he
 The rays of light are reflected from the mirror of the photometer by moving from the lamp and come into focus on a scale by a lens
 jab dhara pravaah ke kaaran chumbakeey yugma main vikshep hota he or darpan kone q dwaara ghumta he, to parvartit prakaash kirne kone 2Q main gumti hai or scale par prakashabindu main sthanantaran ho jaataa he
 By this method, the micro-deflection of the needle can be measured and as a result, the extreme current can be measured with this thermometer
 asthaitik chumbakeey yugma kaa prayog kai prakaar se vibhinn naamon ke dharamapiyon main kiya gaya he
 Calvin Dharmapi, Pashen Dharmapi and Broca Dharmapi are some examples
 in dharamapiyon se 10-12 ampiore tak kii dhara naapi ja sakati he
 a hydrometer is a thermometer, especially an inertometer, is very sensitive, but it is inconvenient to use
 ye asthaayee bhi hote hai
 This is why they are rarely used
 adhiktar chalkundal dharamapi kaa hi upyog hota he, kyonki ye yathesht sookshmagrahi hone ke atirikt, sthaayee, saral tathaa suvidhajanak hote hai

 bihar ke parivahan mantri Acharya Vinoba Bhave was a freedom fighter fighter, social worker and famous Gandhian leader of India
 unka mul naam vinayak narhari bhaave tha
 He is considered the national teacher of India and the spiritual successor of Mahatma Gandhi
 unhone apane jivan ke aakhri varsh ponar, maharashtra ke ashram main gujaarey
 He started the Bhoodan movement
 indira gandhi dwaara ghoshit apatkaal ko 'anushaasan parv' kehane ke kaaran ve vivaad main bhi the
 Vinoba Bhave's original name was Vinayak Narhari Bhave
 maharashtra ke konkan kshetra main ek gaanv he, gagoda
 yahaan ke chitapaavan brahman the, narhari bhaave
 ganit ke premi or vaigyanik sooyeeboojh vaale
 rasayan vigyaan main unki ruchi thi
 In those days colors had to be imported from outside
 narhari bhaave raat-din rangon kii khoj main lage rahete
 bas ek dhun thi unki ki bharat ko is maamle main aatmanirbhar banaaya ja sake
 His mother Rukmini Bai was a female student
 udaar-chitt, aathon yam bhakthi-bhav main dubi rahati
 iskaa asar unke dainik kaary par bhi padataa tha
 Had the mind gone somewhere else, sometimes the salt would have reduced in the vegetable, sometimes more
 Sometimes forget to add asafoetida to the lentils, and sometimes the lentils are served without the pot
 The whole house was filled with devotional juice
 isliye in choti-moti baton kii ore kisi kaa dhyaan hi nahin jaataa tha
 Vinoba was born on 11 September 1895 in the same Satvik environment
 unka bachapan kaa naam tha vinayak
 maa unhen pyaar se vinya kahkar bulaatin
 vinoba ke alaava rukmini bai ke do or bete the: valcoba or shivaji
 vinayak se chote valcoba
 shivaji sabase chote
 vinoba naam gandhi ji ne diya tha
 According to the practice of putting 'ba' behind the name in Maharashtra
 Tukoba, Vithoba and Vinoba
 maa kaa swabhaav vinayak ne bhi paaya tha
 His mind is always absorbed in spiritual thinking
 He was not able to eat or drink
 na swaad kii khaas pahchaan thim
 Served like a mother, she would eat quietly
 Rukmini Bai's throat was very sweet
 bhajan sunate hue ve usamen dub jaatin
 gaatin to bhav-vibhor hokar, puure vaataavaran main bhakthi-salila pravaahit hone lagati
 ramayana kii chapaaiyaan ve madhur bhav se gaatin
 aisa lagata jaise maa sharada gunaguna rahi ho
 His mother Rukmini Bai was instrumental in giving Vinoba the rites of spirituality, leading her towards bhakti-vedanta, inspiring her to renounce and recluse in her childhood
 balak vinayak ko mata-pita donon ke sanskaar mili
 He received from his father the art of thinking and reasoning in mathematics, deep affection for science, scientific approach to tradition and the art of thinking away from all kinds of prejudices
 jabaki maa kii ore se mili dharm or samskruti ke prati gahan anuraag, pranimaatr ke kalyaan kii bhaavana
 jivan ke prati sakaaratmak drushtikon, sarvadharm sambhaav, sashastitv or sasamman kii kala
 aage chalakar vinoba ko gandhi ji kaa aadhyatmik uttaradhikari mana gaya
 Even today some people say this
 magar yah vinoba ke charitra kaa ekangi or ekatarfa vishleshan he
 He was a master of independent thinking, far ahead of Gandhi's 'spiritual successor'
 mukhya baat yah he ki gandhi ji ke prakhar prabhamandal ke aage unke vyaktitv kaa swatantra moolyankan ho hi nahin paaya
 Mahatma Gandhi was a political animal
 unki aadhyatmik chetana subah-shaam kii aarti or puja-paath tak simit thi
 Whereas his religious-consciousness was favorable and coordinative of his political programs
 usamen aalochana-samiksha bhav ke liye koi sthaan nahin tha
 In the matter of religion, even Vinoba had dedication and acceptance
 magar unhen jab bhi avasar mila dharm-granthon kii vyakhya unhone li se hatakar kii
 Whether it is 'gita discourse' or 'santprasad', a book written on the abuses of Sant Tukaram This gives it enough originality and ease
 yah kaary vahi kar saktaa tha jo kisi ke bhi bauddhik prabhamandal se mukt ho
 One thing is that even before Mahatma Gandhi entered into peace, Vinoba had attained spiritual height
 ashram main aanane ke baad bhi ve adhyayan-chintan ke liye niyamit samay nikaalte the
 On being impressed in his first meeting with Vinoba, Gandhi ji had said instinctively- darshanashastra unka priy vishay tha
 Within a few months of admission to the ashram, he took a year of study leave for further study of philosophy
 vinoba ke yun to do chote bhai or bhi the, magar maa kaa sarvaadhik vatsalya vinayak ko hi mila
 On an emotional level, Vinoba also found himself closer to his mother than his father
 yahi haal rukmini bai kaa tha, teenon beton main ‘vinya’ unke dil ke sarvaadhik kareeb tha
 She remained devoted to bhajan-pujan
 Effect of mother's rites
 The feeling of indifference and renunciation towards material comforts had become a part of Vinoba's character in his teens
 ghar kaa nirjan konaa unhen zyada sukun detaa
 maun unke antarman ko mukhar bana detaa
 ve ghar main rahete, parivaar main sabake bich, magar aise ki sabake saath rahete hue bhi jaise unase alag, nisprih or nirpeksh hon
 nahin to maa ke paas, unke sanndhyi main
 ‘vinya’ unke dil, unki aadhyatmik man-rachana ke adhik kareeb tha
 If there is any confusion in the mind, then it helps in solving
 Even if there is a spiritual problem, the Vinaya only works
 Even if husband Narhari Bhave also says something, the decision of Vinaya was important in that
 aisa nahin he ki vinya ekadam mukt yaa niyantran se pare tha
 The family code of conduct was also fully applicable to Vinoba
 balki vinoba ke bachapan kii ek ghatana he
 Rukmini Bai had made a rule for children that food will be available only after giving water to basil plant
 Vinya reaches home after playing outside, distraught with hunger
 On reaching mother, she would say: rukmini sone se pehle samarth guru ramdaas kii pustak ‘das bodh’ kaa pratidin adhyayan karatin
 uske baad hi ve charpai par jaatin
 balak vinya par is asar padana swaabhaavik hi tha
 They would tell him stories of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev and Shankaracharya
 The stories of Ramayana, Mahabharata, explain the element knowledge of Upanishads
 Sannyas used to ride on his feelings
 But instead of running away from the world, she insisted on connecting with people
 Instead of running away from the world, she would ask for change
 Often she says, 'vinya, following the house of labor well, the fathers get freedom
 ’ lekin vinya par to guru ramdaas, sant gyaneshwar or shankaracharya kaa bhoot savaar rahata
 in sabhi mahatmaon ne apni aadhyatmik tripti ke liye bahut kam aayu main apane mata-pita or ghar-parivaar kaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 They say- aise main koi or maa hoti to hill jaati
 vichaarmaatr se ro-rokar aasmaan sir par uthaa leti
 kyonki logon kii saamaanya-si pravriti ban chuki he ki tyaagi, vairaagi hona acchhee baat, mahanata kii baat, magar tabhi tak jab tyaagi or vairaagi duusare ke ghar main hon
 apane ghar main sab saadhaaran sansaarik jivan jeena chaahate hai
 But Rukmini Bai was like any other clay
 ve bade pyaar se bete ko samajhaatin— The son was trying to assimilate the mother's words that she would add further bachapan main bahut kushagra buddhi the vinoba
 ganit unka priy vishay tha
 The rites of poetry and spiritual consciousness met the mother
 unheen se jad or chetan donon ko samaan drushti se dekhne kaa bodh jaagaa
 maa bahut kam padhi-likhi thim
 But he told Vinya about his conduct about Aparigraha, Astaya
 sansar main rahete hue bhi usase nisprih-nirlypt rahanaa sikhaaya
 maa kaa hi asar tha ki vinya kavita rachate or or unhen aag ke hawaale kar dete
 duniya main jab sab kuch asthai or kshanbhangur he, kuch bhi saath nahin janaa to apni rachana se hi moh kyon paala jaae
 unki maa yah sab dekhti, sochatin, magar kuch na kahatee
 maano vinya ko bade se bade tyaag ke liye taiyaar kar rahi hon
 vinoba kii ganit kii praveenta or uske tark unke aadhyatmik vishwaas ke aade nahin aate the
 Even if there was competition between the two, the victory would be of spiritual faith
 Today those events are a historical document of mutual affection and affection of mother and son
 rukmini bai har maheene chaaval ke ek lakh dane daan karti thim
 It was not easy to count one lakh, so she would keep counting every single rice for the whole month
 Narahari Bhave smiled to see his wife laboring in counting rice
 At an early age, the eye would become afraid of weakness
 His math intelligence would have said something else
 So one day he interrupted Rukmini Bai - 'what is the need to spend time counting each and every rice like this? ek pav chaaval lo
 unki ginati kar lo
 phir usee se ek lakh chawlon kaa vajan nikaalkar taul lo
 kami na rahe, isliye ekaadh mutthi upar se daal lo
’ baat tark kii thi
 Cosmic prudence was also in it that whenever possible, time should be saved for other important tasks
 Rukmini Bai would have understood the logic of her husband
 But the mind does not agree One day after he revealed his dilemma to Vinya, he asked- bete ne sabakuch suna, sochaa
 Said, 'mother, father has reason to argue
 ganit yahi kahata he
 But counting rice for charity is not just counting
 ginati karte samay har chaaval ke saath ham na keval ishwar kaa naam lete jate hai, balki hamaara man bhi usee se judaa rahata he
 'counting rice for charity in the name of God is also a practice, where did Rukmini Bai first think
 aadhyatmaras main puri tarah dubi rahane vaali rukmini bai ko ‘vinya’ kii baaten khub bhaatin
 bete par garv ho aata tha unhen
 unhone aage bhi chawlon kii ginati karnaa na choda
 na hi is kaam se unke man kabhi nirarthakta bodh jaagaa
 This is another incident
 jo darshaati he ki vinoba kori ganitiya gananaaon main aadhyatmik tatv kaise khoj lete the
 The incident is about the time when he entered Gandhiji's ashram and was actively participating in his creative works
 ashram main subah-shaam prarthana sabhaayen hotin
 unamem upasthit hone vaale ashramavaasiyon kii niyamit ginati kii jaati
 yah jimmedaari ek kaaryakarta thi
 The incident is that one day after the prayer meeting, when that worker told the number of visitors who were present in the prayer, Vinoba quickly reacted saying - kaaryakarta ko apni ginati par vishwaas tha, isliye vah bhi apni baat par ad gaya
 Vinoba, who believed in karma, generally avoided getting into arguments
 magar us din ve bhi apni baat par ad gaye
 Disputes in the ashram were settled in Bapu's court
 gandhi ji ko apane kaaryakarta par vishwaas tha
 But knew that Vinoba was not going to get into arguments like this
 He looked at Vinoba to know the reality
 Then Vinoba said - 'the number of devotees involved in the prayer was less than what they told
 ’ ‘vah kaise?’ ‘isliye ki ek aadmi kaa to puraa dhyaan vahaan upasthit sajjanon kii ginati karne main laga tha
 Gandhiji understood Vinoba's logic
 prarthana ke kaam main hisaab-kitaab or dikhaave kii jarurat hi kya
 aage se prarthana sabha main aae logon kii ginati kaa kaam roak diya gaya
 Vinoba Aanjan was determined to remain celibate in the early stages of puberty
 vahi mahapurush unke adarsh the jinhone satya kii khoj ke liye bachapan main hi vairaygy odh liya tha
 And when you have to become celibate by taking renunciation, if you want to break away from home life, why not prepare your mind accordingly
 Why be entangled in the sweet cords of relationships, worldly temptations
 The first condition of celibacy is to prevent the mind from wandering
 Control over lusts
 kishor vinayak se kisi ne kah diya tha ki brahmacharee ko kisi vivaah ke bhoj main sammilit nahin hona chahie
 He often avoided going to such programs
 pita narhari bhaave to the hi, yadi kisi or ko hi janaa hua to chote bhai chale jate
 vinoba kaa tan durbal tha
 There was some disease since childhood
 But mind-mind is fully conscious
 It is as if all the powers of the body were confined into the mind
 The memory was unique
 kishor vinayak ne veda, upanishad ke saath-saath sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev ke saikadon pad acchhee tarah yaad kar liye the
 Geeta had memorized him since childhood
 aage chalakar chalis hajaar shloke bhi unke maanas main acchhee tarah ram gaye
 When Vinayak's elder sister's marriage was fixed, it was as if the hour of examination also came closer
 unhone tay kar liya ki vivaah ke avasar par bhoj se dur rahenge
 koi tokaa-taaki na kare, isliye unhone us din upwas rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In the sister's marriage, the brother fasted, this was also not appropriate
 pita to sunate hi naaraaz ho gaye
 But the mother handled the matter
 unhone bete ko saadhaaran ‘daal-bhaat’ khaane ke liye raji kar liya
 Not only this, he cooked it with his own hands and gave it too
 dhooma-dham se vivaah hua
 Vinayak happily participated in it
 lekin apane liye maa dwaara khaas taur par banaae daal-bhaat se hi guzaara kiya
 This love of mother and son continued even further
 aage chalakar jab sanyas ke liye ghar choda to maa kii ek laal kinari vaali dhoti or unke puujaghar se ek muti saath le gaye
 He had presented the idol to another
 magar maa kii dhoti jahaan bhi ve jate, apane saath rakhte
 sote to sirahaane rakhkar
 jaise maa kaa aashirwad saath liye phirte hon
 sanyasi man bhi maa kii smritiyon se peechha nahin chhuta paaya tha
 The rites of mother became the foundation of Vinoba's spiritual consciousness
 unheen par unka jeevandarshan viksit hua
 Later on, the fame he earned in the field of creativity and spirituality was also the inspiration of his mother
 rukmini bai kam padhi-likhin thim
 Did not understand Sanskrit
 lekin man tha ki gita-gyaan ke liye tarasata rahata
 ek din maa ne apni kathinaayee putr ke samaksh rakh hi di— Vinoba was opposed to hypocrisy in religious rites
 maa ke nidhan ke samay bhi vinoba kaa apane pita or bhaaiyon se matbhed hua
 Vinoba was opposed to cremation in the traditional manner with the hands of the Brahmins
 lekin parivaar waalon kii jid ke aage unki ek na chali
 vinoba bhi apane siddhanton par adig the
 As a result, the mother whom he wanted most, who was his spiritual master, stayed away from his funeral
 maa ko unhone bhigi ankhon se maun vidaai di
 Later on 29 October 1947, when Vinoba's father died, he insisted on pressing the soil, instead of dedicating his body to fire, following the instructions of the Vedas that 'the soil has the right to the soil'
 tab tak vinoba sant vinoba ho chuke the
 He was blessed by Gandhiji
 isliye is baar unheen kii chali
 Mother had faith in Gita
 ve vinoba ko gita kaa marathi main anuwaad karne kaa daayitv saunpkar gai thim
 Vinoba was busy in that task
 aakhir anuwaad karm puraa hua
 The book was named - Geetai
 Geeta + i = Geetai
 In Maharashtra, 'I' means 'towards mother'; That is, the memory of the mother is associated with her nehru-gita
 Rukmini Bai was not alive to see the son's work
 magar unki yaad or abhilaashaa se judi gitai, maharashtra ke ghar-ghar main maataaon or bahanon ke kanth-swar main dhalane lagi
 His spirituality became the jewel of consciousness
 gandhi ji ne suna to anuwaad karm kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii
 For women who did not know Sanskrit, who had even half-incomplete knowledge of their language, 'geetai', composed in simple language, became a boon to drown in the spirituality of the Gita
 vinoba ko bachapan main maa se mili sanskaar yuvavastha main or bhi gadhe hote chale gaye
 Moving towards youth, Vinoba had neither forgotten Saint Dnyaneshwar nor Tukaram
 vahi unke adarsh the
 He used to sing with great enthusiasm in Saint Tukaram
 He liked to fight, quarrel with his adorable, abusive and angry, he liked very much
 The life of Saint Ramdas also inspired him
 He was neither able to forget Shankaracharya nor his retirement
 darshan unka priy vishay tha
 Ever since the Himalayas were conscious, they used to come in their dreams and they would have imagined themselves meditating in deep tendons in search of truth
 The uninhabited there, in the long, deep cauldrons covered with worms, used to incite them to become absorbed in the pursuit of supreme truth
 1915 main unhone hai skool kii pariksha paas kii
 Now what to read next The ideological duality of the father of scientific temper and mother steeped in spirituality also appeared in different streams there
 pita ne kahaμ‘french padho
’ maa boleen—‘brahman kaa betaa sanskrit na padhe, yah kaise sambhav he!’ vinoba ne un donon kaa man rakhaa
 Chose French at Inter
 sanskrit kaa adhyayan unhone nijee str par jari rakhaa
 In those days, French was the language of revolution in the field of knowledge science
 sara parivartankami sahitya usamen rachaa ja rahaa tha
 Baroda's library, on the other hand, was famous throughout the country for treasures of rare books, manuscripts
 vinoba ne us pustkaalay ko apana doosraa thikaana bana diya
 As soon as he was discharged from school, he would go to the library and drown in studies
 French literature introduced Vinoba to the ideological revolution happening in western countries
 Knowledge of Sanskrit enabled him to penetrate deeply into the Vedas and Upanishads
 gyaan kaa str badha, to uski lalak bhi badi
 magar man se himalay kaa aakarshan, sanyas kii saadh, vairagyabodh na gaya
 In those days, had to go to Mumbai for the Inter examination
 vinoba bhi tay kaarykram ke anusaar 25 march 1916 ko mumbai jane vaali railgadee main savaar hue
 us samay unka man dawandol tha
 i was confident that i would pass the Inter exam just like high school
 But what after that? Is this the goal of his life? Vinoba felt that what he wanted in his life was not possible through formal study
 vidhyalay ke praaanpatr or kaliz kii digriyaan unka abhishth nahin hai
 The train was running at its own pace
 usase sahasr guna tej bhaag rahaa tha vinoba kaa man
 aakhir jeet man kii hui
 As soon as the car reached Surat, Vinoba came down from it
 gaadi aage badi par vinoba kaa man duusari ore khinchataa chalaa gaya
 On the second platform, there was an eastbound train
 vinoba ko laga ki himalay ek baar phir unhen aamantrit kar rahaa he
 Household life or retirement
 There was a struggle in the mind for some time
 He made the decision while going through the turbulence and boarded the same car
 sanyasi apni pasandida yatra par nikal padaa
 is hakeekat se anjaan ki is baar bhi jis yatra ke liye ve thaan kar nikle hai, vah unki asli yatra nahin, sirf ek padaav he
 Escape from life is not their destiny
 unhen to lakhon-karodon bharatiyon ke jivan kii saadh, unke liye ek ummid banakar ubharna he
 Vinoba was wandering in search of Brahm, the search for truth, the practice of renunciation
 usee lakshya ke saath unhone ghar choda tha
 The journey towards the Himalayas was on
 bich main kaashi kaa padaav aayaa
 According to myths, the city of Lord Shankar
 Kashi has been the center of religious philosophy for thousands of years
 Aquarius of sages and thinkers
 a holy pilgrimage center attracting curious and knowledge-oriented people
 Even Shankaracharya could not stop himself from the temptation of traveling to Kashi
 kaashi ke ganga ghat par jahaan nae vichaar panape to vitanda bhi anginat rache jate rahe
 Vinoba was wandering on the same Ganges coast
 apane liye manzil kii talash main
 guru kii talash main jo unhen aage kaa rasta dikhaa sake
 The path to reach the goal for which he had left home
 bhatakate hue ve ek sthaan par pahunche jahaan kuch satya-sadhak shastrarth kar rahe the
 The subject was who was right in advaita and dvaita
 The question was quite old
 lagbhag baarah sau varsh pehle bhi is par nirnaayak bahes ho chuki thi
 Between Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra
 In that historical debate, the dualist Mandan Mishra and his wife were defeated by Shankaracharya
 vahi vishay phir un satya-saadhakon ke bich aa fansaa tha
 Or say that the two sides were creating their own arguments with their arguments to cut the time
 or phir bahes ko samaapan kii ore le jate hue achaanak ghoshnaa kar di gai ki advaitavaadi kii jeet hui he
 Vinoba Chanke
 He lost his laugh- ek ore vinoba sanyas kii saadh main, satyanveshan kii lalak liye kaashi kii galiyon main, ghaaton par bhatak rahe the
 On the other hand, another curious was set out to visit India, to know India, to recognize the beats of his heartland, to establish an intimate relationship with him
 vah kuch hi maheene pehle dakshin africa se beshumaar khyaati batorkar lautaa tha
 Further, it was planned to interfere in Indian politics
 us sadhak kaa naam tha—mohandas karamchand gandhi
 apane raajnneetik guru govind ballab pant ke kehane par vah bharat kii aatma ko jaanane ke uddeshy se ek varsh ke bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua tha
 Gandhi, who later became the non-violent fighter, became the main architect of the Indian independence movement, the heartbeat of crores of Indians, dominated the Indian politics in those days
 ‘mahatma’ kii oopaadhi bhi unase dur thi
 Only the capital of the agitation launched in South Africa was with him
 usee ke kaaran ve puure bharat main jane jate the
 In those days his stop was also Kashi
 maano do mahaan atmaaon ko milwane ke liye samay apana jaadui khel rach rahaa tha
 In Kashi, a huge procession was taking place in the Hindu University established by Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya
 4 farvari 1916, jalse main raaje-maharaaje, nabaav, samant sab apni puri dhaj ke saath upasthit the
 It was made on seeing the tone of the conference
 us sammelan main gandhi ji ne aitihaasik bhaashan diya
 He said what no one could expect at that time
 vakt padane par jin raja-saamanton kii khushaamad swayan angrej bhi karte the, jinke daan par kaashi vishvavidhyalay or duusari anya sansthaaen chalaa karti thim, un raja-saamanton kii khuli aalochana karte hue gandhi ji ne kaha ki apane dhan kaa sadupyog rashtranirmaan ke liye karen
 Apply it for the welfare of the poor
 He asked them to donate all their jewelery to the wider public interest
 vah ek krantikari apil thi
 There was a panic in the meeting
 par gandhi kii muskaan usee tarah bani rahi
 The next day the newspapers were dyed with the news of that conference
 vinoba ne samachaarpatr ke madhyam se hi gandhi ji ke bare main janaa
 or unhen laga ki jis lakshya kii khoj main ve ghar se nikle hai, vah puri hui
 Vinoba Corey did not leave home in search of peace
 na ve desh ke halaat or angrejon dwaara kiye ja rahe amanviya atyaacharon se aparichit the
 But there was no way out
 bhaashan padhakar unhen laga ki is vyakti ke paas shanti bhi he or kranti bhi
 unhone vahiin se gandhi ji ke naam patr likhaa
 jawaab aayaa
 With Gandhiji's invitation
 Vinoba was waiting for him
 ve turant ahmedabad sthit cocharb ashram kii ore prasthaan kar gaye, jahaan gandhi ji kaa ashram tha
 On 7 June 1916 Vinoba met Gandhi for the first time
 uske baad to vinoba gandhi ji ke hi hokar rah gaye
 Gandhiji also recognized Vinoba's talent
 isliye pehali mulaakaat ke baad hi unki tippanee thi ki adhikansh log yahaan se kuch lene ke liye aate hai, yah pehla vyakti he, jo kuch dene ke liye aayaa he
 Recalling his first meeting after a long time, Vinoba said- gandhi or vinoba kii vah mulaakaat krantikari thi
 As soon as Gandhiji came to know that Vinoba had come without telling his parents, he wrote a letter to Vinoba's father from there that Vinoba was safe with him
 uske baad unke sambandh lagaataar pragadh hote chale gaye
 Vinoba devoted himself to Gandhiji's ashram
 adhyayan, adhyaapan, katai, kheti ke kaam se lekar saamudayik jivan tak ashram kii har gatividhi main ve aage rahete
 gandhi ji kaa yah kahana ki yah yuvak ashramavaasiyon se kuch lene nahin balki dene aayaa he, satya hota ja rahaa tha
 Vinoba, who was very young from his age, was teaching him a lesson of discipline and dutifulness
 gandhi ji kaa prabhaav teji se bad rahaa tha
 The number of workers coming to the ashram is increasing equally fast
 The Kocharb ashram started getting smaller, and the work of new ashram on the banks of Sabarmati in Ahmedabad started happening fast
 But the work of preparing non-violent soldiers of independence was not possible even from the Sabarmati Ashram alone
 gandhi vaisaa hi ashram wardha main bhi chaahate the
 There was a need for such a disciplined worker who could run the ashram in accordance with Gandhiji's ideals
 For this, Vinoba was the most suitable character and reliable of Gandhiji
 Vinoba departed for Wardha on 8 April 1923
 vahaan unhone ‘maharashtra dharm’ masik kaa sampadan shuru kiya
 In this magazine to be published in Marathi, Vinoba began writing regularly on the Upanishads and saints of Maharashtra, which led to the beginning of the Bhakti movement in the country
 patrika ko apratyaashit lokapriyata praapt hui, kuch hi samay pashchaat usko saptahik kar dena padaa vinoba abhi tak gandhi ji ke shishy or satyagrahi ke rup main jane jate the
 Through the magazine, the public was getting to know their spiritual penetration
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay united kingdom dwaara bharat desh ko jabaran yuddh main jhonka ja rahaa tha jiske viruddh ek vyaktigat satyagrah 17 aktubar, 1940 ko shuru kiya gaya tha or isamen gandhi ji dwaara vinoba ko pratham satyagrahi banaaya gaya tha
 Before starting his Satyagraha, Vinoba issued a statement clarifying his views
 usamen kaha gaya tha- He further said so much - apane bhaashanon main vinoba logon ko bataate the ki nakaaratmak kaaryakramon ke jariye na to shaanti sthapit ho sakati he or na yuddh samaapt ho saktaa he
 War is the result of a morbid mentality and requires creative programs
 keval europe ke logon ko nahin samast maanav jati ko iskaa daayitv uthaanaa chahie
 In September 1951, k
p
mashruwala's book Gandhi and Marx was published and Vinoba wrote the role
 isamen vinoba ne marks ke prati kaaphi sammaan pradarshit kiya tha
 He considered Karl Marx a thinker
 aisa vichaarak jiske man main garibon ke prati sachhee sahanubhuti thi
 By the way, Vinoba was found to be wrong in Marx's thinking and expressed his differences with Marx on how to reach the goal
 vinoba kaa maananaa tha ki dhani logon kii vajah se communiston kaa udbhav hua he
 Vinoba believed that the principle of equality should be applied in everything
 unhone kaha tha : communiston kaa aatank dur karne ke liye police karrwai madadgaar sabit nahin ho sakati
 It should be eliminated from the root
 chaahe jitne bhi digbhramit ve kyon na ho, vinoba communiston ko vidhvansak nahin maanate the or unase tarkvitark karke tathaa unke lakshya ke prati sakriy sahanubhuti prakat karke vinoba unhen sahi raste par laana chaahate the
 Vinoba ji, a scholar of twenty languages, wanted to see Devanagari as a world script
 bharat ke liye ve devanagari ko sampark lipi ke rup main viksit karne ke pakshdhar the
 They used to say that i do not say that Nagari should only go, but i want Nagari also to go
 unke hi vichaaron se prerana lekar nagari lipi sangam kii sthapana kii gayi he jo bharat ke andar or bharat ke baahar devanagari ko upyog or prasar karne ke liye kaary karti he
 For detailed information read Nagari and Indian languages
 vinobaaji sadev saamaajik or rachanaatmak kaaryakarta rahe
 He actively contributed to Gandhian's creative works before independence
 kaarydhiky se unka swasthya girane laga, unhen kisi pahari sthaan par jane kii doctor ne salaah di
 So in 1937, Vinoba Bhave went to the Pawanar Ashram
 tab se lekar jivan paryant unke rachanaatmak kaaryon ko prarambh karne kaa yahi kendriya sthaan rahaa
 He was also a great freedom fighter in addition to creative works
 nagpur jhanda satyagrah main ve bandi banaaye gayi
 In 1937, when Gandhiji surrendered empty handed from the London Round Table Conference, Vinoba Bhave criticized the British at a gathering in Jalgaon, and was sentenced to six months in prison
 karagaar se mukt hone ke baad gandhiji ne unhen pahela satyagrahi banaaya

 The liquidation of companies is an action that ends the statutory existence of the company
 isamen company kii sampattiyon ko bechakar praapt dhan se rinon kaa bhugtan kiya jaataa he tathaa shesh dhan kaa anshadhariyon ke bich vitaran kar diya jaataa he
 There are three types of company closing: nyaayalay dwaara samaapan ke liye prarthanapatr dene kaa adhikaar swayan company, uske rindaataaon, dhandaataaon tathaa kuch sthitiyon main register athwa kendriya sarkaar dwaara adhikrut vyakti ko hota he
 The main reasons for winding up by the court are: the reduction in the number of members of the company to the lowest number prescribed by the Companies Act and the inability of the company to pay debts

 kintu jab company apane rinon kaa bhugtan karne main asamarth ho tathaa sanchaalak isaki shodhakshmata kii ghoshnaa na kar saken, aisi paristhiti main kiye janevaale samaapan ko rindaataaon kaa aichhik samaapan kehete hai
 In such a conclusion, it is necessary that on the day the general assembly is convened to pass the resolution on the same or next day, a meeting of the lenders is called
 company ke sadsy evam rindaata apni apni sabhaaon main samaapak kaa manonayan kar sakate hai
 If the persons nominated by members and creditors are different, only the person nominated by the creditors is appointed as the liquidator of the company
 rindaata apni ukt sabha yaa kisi aagaamee sabha main paanch sadasyon tak kii ek nirikshan samiti niyukt kar sakate hai
 The remuneration of the liquidator can be determined by the Inspection Committee, by the creditors in the absence of it and also by the court in the absence of the creditors
 company dwaara aichhik samaapan ke prastaav paas kiye jane ke pashchaat nyaayalay is prakaar ke samaapan kaa aadesh de saktaa he
 The termination of the company by such order is only voluntary but it is done as per the instructions of the court
 iskaa uddeshy company, rindaataaon tathaa anshadhariyon ke hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 Under the direction of the court, the effect of the winding up petition is that the court has jurisdiction over all the promises and valid proceedings in the same way as the petition of winding up by the court
 nirdesan aadesh ke pashchaat nyaayalay ko samaapak ke padchyut karne, uski rikti kii purti karne tathaa atirikt samaapak niyukt karne kaa adhikaar praapt ho jaataa he
