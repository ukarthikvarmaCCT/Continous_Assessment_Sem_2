 Poverty is very widespread in India but is decreasing very rapidly
 anumaan he ki vishwa kii sampoorn garib aabaadi kaa teesraa hissaa bharat main he
 In 2010, the World Bank reported that 32
7% of Indians live below the international poverty line of US $ 1
25 a day and 68
7% of people live on less than US $ 2 a day
 yojana ayog ke saal 2009-2010 ke garibi aankade kehete hai ki pichley paanch saal ke dauraan desh main garibi 37

 That is, those who spend 28 rupees 65 paise per day in the city and 22 rupees 42 paise in the villages cannot be called poor
 According to the new formula, a person spending more than 859 rupees 60 paise in cities and 672 rupees 80 paise in rural areas is not poor
 isse ek baar phir us vivaad ko hawa mil sakati he jo yojana ayog dwaara ucchtam nyaayalay main daayar kiye gaye halafname ke baad shuru hua tha
 In it, the commission had mentioned that the poverty line should be fixed at Rs 32 per day in 2004-05
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki yojana ayog kii ore se nirdhaarit kiye gaye ye aankade bhraamak hai or aisa lagata he ki ayog kaa maqasad garibon kii sankhya ko ghataana he taaki kam logon ko sarkari kalyankari yojanaon kaa faaydaa dena pade
 There are various estimates on the number of poor in India
 aadhikarik aankadon kii maane, to bharat kii 37 pratishat aabaadi garibi rekha ke neeche he
 Whereas according to another estimate, this figure may be 77 percent
 bharat main mahangaai dar main lagaataar badhottaree darj kii gai he
 Many analysts say that it is not permissible to set the poverty line figures on monthly earnings
 saal 2011 may main vishwa bank kii ek report main saamne aayaa tha ki garibi se ladane ke liye bharat sarkaar ke prayaas paryaapt sabit nahin ho paa rahe hai
 The report said that government schemes made for the poor have not been successful due to corruption and ineffective management

 In other sources, where Gorichen is defined as a group of six little ones, the "kang To" peak, 7,042 meters, locally called the "lion Kangdi", is described as the tallest and the only one in eastern India The peak is said to be more than seven thousand meters in height
 pathar yaa eent kii chinai karanevaalon ko raaj kehete hai
 And his work is called Rajgiri in a broad sense, but in practice the word Rajgiri is often used for stone masonry
 eent kaa kaam eent chinai hi kaha jaataa he
 The early man-made ungainly creations may have been made from yesterday itself, but such a work of stone which can be called Rajgiri definitely came with the development of civilization
 rajgiri ke sabase puraane namoonay bharat or misr ke mandiron main milte hai
 Many of these ancient structures have very large stones, which makes us wonder today that even in that era, our ancestors were not only extracting stones of seven to eight hundred and eight hundred tons from the mines, but they were very high
 Used to pick up and also put it in buildings
 yah sab kaise kiya jaataa tha, iskaa bhed abhi tak nahin mil paaya
 In the ancient rajgiri, the hammer is usually made, not the chisel or the stitch
 gadhane or lagane kii vidhiyaan praaia: aisi hi thim, jaisi aajkal hai; alabatta dhulaai kii asuvidha ke kaaran chote-chote pathar hi praaia: lagaae jate the
 When the stitching began to be done, then such an art form emerged, which it seems that if the architecture was not of stone, it would have spoken
 rajgiri ke upkaran mote taur se paanch virgon main baante ja sakate hai : There are different types of hammers for different types of work, such as cube, timber hammer, corrugated hammer, pointed hammer, thread pin hammer, basuli, teshi etc
 lakdi ke hathode, arthath moongariyaan bhi kai aakaar-prakaar kii hoti hai
 The fresh stone extracted from the mine is heated and easily cut
 haath kaa aara naram pathar, jaise porbandar kaa chooney kaa pathar, kaatane ke kaam aata he
 It is similar to a carpenter's saw
 bade bade khand kaatane ke liye dohatthi aare hote hai
 Very large sections are cut from the structure
 ye aare 4 foot se 15 foot tak lambey hote hai or rassiyon dwaara giriyon se latakaae jate hai, taaki chalaanewaalon ko unka vajan na sanbhaalanaa pade
 The cutting leaf is of plain steel, in which the teeth are made
 kataai karte samay pani ke saath saath baaluu daali jaati he
 Water acts as lubrication and cuts sand
 chheniyaan yaa taankiyaan hathode se bhi adhik prakaar kii hoti hai, jaise, choti, badi, daantedaar, sapaat arthath chauras, moti, paini, tej, chaudee, sankri, nukili aadi
 The pointed stitch is called Summa
 bahut badi taanki savbal kehalaati he, jo kisi had tak apane vajan ke kaaran hathode kii choton kii apeksha nahin rakhti
 This makes holes in hard stones for tunneling
 bade pathar uthaane ke liye utthapak kaa kaam bhi isse le liya jaataa he
 The tools of marking and placement are the same for stone masonry, as for brick masonry, such as kanni or karni, yarn, plumb, gunia, gaja, mercury label or talompi, pata etc
 pathar uthaane ke upkaran vishesh prakaar ke hote hai, jo bade bade pathar yathasthaan rakhane ke kaam aate hai
 Doli or luis, pinches or nippers and gantras are notable in this regard
 khan se nikaale hue taaje pathar main ras bahut hota he; isliye uski gadhaai aasaani se ho jaati he
 The juice dries up when the air is eaten and the stone becomes hard
 khan par hi gadhaai karne se avaanchit bhaar bhi nikaal jaataa he or dhulaai kaa vyay bhi ghat jaataa he
 But it is necessary that before planting in the building, the stone eats the air properly, so that it becomes strong by cooking
 sant paal ke bade girjaghar ke vaastu, sar christopher rain, ne is sambandh main yah shart rakhi thi ki khan se nikalne ke baad 3 saal tak pathar samudratat par khulaa padaa rahe, tab kahin vah giraje main lagane yogya samajha jayega
 While collecting stones, it should be kept in mind that the joints are kept right and the surface is flat
 sataha ubhari hui ho to sandhiyaan chaudee hoti hai
 The stone may also stagger
 kattal laga lagaakar is prakaar ke pathar jamaana uchit nahin he
 If the surface is concave, the core is stressed, causing it to crack and crumble
 tuuti phooti koronvaale pattharon kii chinai kharaab dikhaai padati he
 Before settling in the big stone spices, it should be kept in place before drying to see if they fit properly
 yah saavdhaanee rakhni chahie ki pathar tuutane na paae or na papadi hi ukhde, kyonki phir uski marammat nahin ho sakati
 The stone should always be installed in such a way that the load should always be perpendicular to the natural curve
 is prakaar jahaan keval urdhwadhar bhaar hi aata ho yahan pathar kii prakritik paraten kshaitij rahani chahie
 For planting in long poles etc
, the stone should be cut after cutting from the bottom of the appropriate thickness
 chinai main masala kam se kam lagaana chahie, kintu sadhiyaan poli na rahani chahie
 If there is a soft stone, such as raw sandstone or limestone, then the length of any stone should not exceed three times its thickness
 rajgiri main uchit bandha kaa bahut mahatv he
 In bayonet masonry, one section remains in a well-bonded bond
 vaastushilpi isaki ek ek sandhi kaa sthaan nishchat kar dete hai
 The bonding is achieved by applying todas or paving stones in Dhoka Masonry
 dhur pathar aage se peeche tak kaaphi mote or chaude hone chahie
 Generally the width should be deodorant in height and their area on the wall surface should be equal to the area of the whole area
 raddedaar chinai main ye praaia: paanch paanch foot kii duuri par lagaae jate hai or prayek radde main sthaan badal badalakar visham sthiti main rakhe jate hai
 When bayonet masonry is only in front, it goes deep from 4 to 9
 diwaar kaa shesh eent chinai yaa dhoka chinai se hi banaaya jaataa he
 Usually it is plastered
 saamne kii ore pusht kii, donon chinaayiyon main uchit vaid rakhana aavashyak hota he
 Dhoka masonry is often of two types: raddevar chinai main kabhi kabhi kuch thodaa bahut gadhakar chauras kiye hue pathar lagaae jate hai
 It is called Raddevar, Chaurus, Dhoka Masonry
 duusari raddevar, angadh, dhoka chinai kehalaati he
 Berdda masonry is the only of the uncovered dhokas
 sangeen chinai bhi pathar kii gadhaai ke anusaar kai prakaar kii hoti he
 If all the surfaces of the stone are very finely formed with a stitch and the joints are not more than 1 / 8 inch thick, then it is called fine bayonet masonry
 yadi gadhaai bahut baarik na ho or sandhiyaan 1 / 4 inch moti hon, to vah 'adgarh sangeen chinai' hoti he
 Sometimes the outer surfaces of its stones are finely carved to form a ledge and the middle part of the margins are left uncultivated
 yah 'angadh sangeen chinai' kehalaati he; kintu yadi pattharon kii koron main lagbhag ek inch gaharaai tak salaani kar di jaati he, arthath pakh maar di jaati he, to vah 'pakhadaar sangeen chinai' ho jaati he
 Sometimes at the ends of the wall, or sometimes even in the middle, the bayonets are masonry in the form of pillars, and the remaining part is made of rough stone masonry, whose remains are lower than the masonry canals
 dilhon kii yah chinai 'pindak chinai' kehalaati he
 Since bricks used in one place are often the same, many types of bonding, or tricks, are used for brick masonry
 prayek chaal main yah dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki khadi sandhiyaan ek duusari ke upar na paden, balki kam se kam itnaa hatakar hon jitna eent kii lambaai kaa chauthai hota he
 To achieve this pressure, a deli is left after each side canopy, which is as broad as a quarter brick
 bandhon, arthath chaalon, main sabase adhik prachlan toda-pattee chaal kaa he, jise angreji chaal bhi kehete hai
 In this, the trunk of the trunk and the strips of the strips are one after the other respectively
 pattiyon ke raddon main bhi, jahaan kahin bharti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, keval tode hi bhare jate hai
 For the purpose of filling the inner bandages, for this purpose, in the masonry of one and a half, two and a half, three and a half bricks, etc
, there is a move of one more strip in each waste and then on the other side
 duusari chaal, jo adhik prachlit he, flemish chaal he
 In this, the pieces and straps are kept in alternate order in each trash
 diwaar ke donon ore se flemish kehalaati he
 In this, some portions of inner treaties fall on top of each other in all cancellations
 isliye toda-pattee kii chaal kii apeksha yah majboot kuch kam hoti he, yadhyapi darshneey adhik hoti he
 Sometimes, in front of the Flemish and in the pawns, there is a trick of the strips, coordinating the strength and visibility
 ise ikhari flemish chaal kehete hai
 Half a brick wall cannot be hampered; Therefore, in this scrap, only the bandages are cut by keeping the bandages joint
 yah pattee chaal kehalaati he
 Due to the filling of only a wide wall, the wall remains somewhat weak in the direction of length
 isliye har teen chaar raddon ke baad, ek radde kii bharti main, iten tirchhi rakh di jaati hai
 Its diagonal gait is called
 yadi sari iten ek hi disha main tirchhi na karke, ekantar se samakon par ghuma ghuma kar lehren jaisi bana di jaayen, to vah lahariya chaal ho jaati he
 Even in brick-masonry, the joints should be as short as possible
 pratham shrenee kii chinai vah he jisamen sandhiyaan 1 / 4 inch hi chaudee hon
 Sanding can be up to 3 / 8 inch thick in second-tier masonry and uneven and up to 1 / 2 inch thick in third-tier masonry
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki iton ke dilhe upar kii ore hon taaki unamem masala bhalee bhanti bhar jaae or chinai poli na rah jaae
 Many technical terms are often used in Rajagiri in the same sense, such as masonry whether of stone or brick
 diwaar kii saamne dikhalaai padanevaali khadi sataha 'saamana' kehalaati he or uski peeche kii ore kii khadi sataha 'pusht'

 'sheershika' diwaar kaa sabase upree radda he, jo khulaa hua hota he or varsha ke pani se neeche kii diwaar kii raksha karata he
 In order to succeed in its purpose, the width of the apex is often slightly higher than the width of the wall and in the enlarged portions the parrot or drip is sometimes made at the bottom so that the water does not flow away from the wall and away from it
 Drip
 inaki upar kii sataha bhi kabhi kabhi bich se donon ore ko dhaalu rakhi jaati he

 Like Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was also a great poet of Urdu language
 unka urdu takhllus, jise hindi main upnaam kehete hai, hasarat tha
 Apart from Urdu, he also wrote articles and poems in Hindi and English
 unka puraa naam ashfaaq ulla khaan varsi hasarat tha
 The role of Bismil and Ashfaq in the entire history of the Indian freedom struggle is indisputably a unique narrative of hindu-muslim unity
 ashfaaq ulla khaan kaa janm uttar pradesh ke shahidgarh shahjahanpur main railway stesan ke paas sthit kadankhel jalaalanagar muhalle main 22 oktober 1900 ko hua tha
 His father's name was Mohammad Shafiq Ulla Khan
 unki maan majahoorunnishaan begum bhalaa kii khubasurat khabaatinon main gini jaati thim
 Ashfaq himself has written in his diary that while on the one hand he could not get even a single graduation in his father-in-law's family, on the other hand, everyone was highly educated
 unamem se kai to dipti colector va es0 je0 em0 ke ohadon par mulajim bhi rah chuke the
 When those people did not support Hindustan in the mutiny of 1857, the people got angry and set their luxurious house on fire
 vah kothi aaj bhi puure shahar main jali kothi ke naam se mashhoor he
 However, Ashfaq gave his sacrifice and washed away the bad name of the infamous people forever
 ashfaaq apane bhai-bahanon main sabase chote the
 Everyone used to call him affectionately
 ek roj unke bade bhai riyasat ulla ne ashfaaq ko bismil ke bare main bataaya ki vah bada kaabil sakhsh he or aalaa darje kaa shaayar bhi, goyaa aajkal mainpuri kand m giraftaar kii vajah se shahjahanpur main najar nahin aa rahaa
 God has been absconding for a long time and will be living under what circumstances
 bismil unka sabase umdaa classphelo he
 Since then Ashfaq has been desperate to meet Bismil
 vakt gujara
 After the general approval in 1920, Ram Prasad Bismil came to his hometown Shahjahanpur and engaged in domestic business
 ashfaaq ne kai baar bismil se mulaakaat karke unka vishwaas arjeet karnaa chaha parantu kamyaabi nahin mili
 Thus, a meeting was being held in a secluded place on the banks of river Khannaut every night
 Ashfaq reached there
 bismil ke ek sher par jab ashfaaq ne amin kaha to bismil ne unhen paas bulaakar parichay poocha
 Knowing that Ashfaq is a real brother of his classmate Riyasat Ullah and also a poet of Urdu language, Bismil asked him to come to the Arya Samaj temple and meet him separately
 ghar waalon ke lakh manaa karne par bhi ashfaaq arya samaaj ja pahunche or ram prasad bismil se kaaphi der tak guftgu karne ke baad unki party matruvedi ke active member bhi ban gayi
 This is where the new philosophy of his life started
 ve shaayar ke saath-saath kaum ke khidmatgaar bhi ban gayi
 Ashfaq was very far-sighted and advised Ram Prasad Bismil that along with revolutionary activities, keeping his foot in the Congress party would prove to be helpful in our success
 baharhaal ashfaaq va bismil ke saath shahjahanpur ke or bhi kai navayuvak congress main shaamil hue or party ko kaumi takat ata kii
 Ashfaq also joined Ram Prasad Bismil and Premkrishna Khanna in the 1921 Ahmedabad Congress

 When Gandhiji protested against the proposal of Purna Swaraj submitted by Maulana Hasrat Mohani, the Congress volunteers of Shahjahanpur protested against Gandhi and created a lot of uproar
 aakhirkaar gandhi ji ko na chaahate hue bhi vah prastaav sweekaar karnaa hi pada
 Similarly, in the December 1922 Gaya Congress, Gandhi was fiercely pulled by the youth
 isamen bengal, bihar va uttar pradesh ke navayuvak ek ho gayi
 They all had only one question with Gandhi - "whom did you ask and withdrew the non-cooperation Movement?" 1922 kii gaya congress ke baad party main do dal ban gayi ek dhanadhy logon kaa doosraa aam tabake se aaye hue navayuvakon kaa
 The first party formed the Swaraj Party on 1 January 1923, the second party made up its mind to form a revolutionary party
 bengal ke kuch navayuvak sidhe shahjahanpur aakar mainpuri shadyantr ke anbhavi krantikari pandit ram prasad bismil se mili or unase nayi party ke gathan main sahyog karne kaa aagrah kiya
 Bismil was busy in the business of silk sarees in those days, he had no time
 is par ashfaaq ne unhen samajhaayaa or apni ore se puraa sahyog karne kaa vachan diya
 Only after that Bismil handed over the entire business to his partner Banarsi Lal and wholeheartedly engaged in the work of Ashfaq and Bismil Revolutionary Party

 In Bengal, after the arrest of two prominent persons like Shachindranath Sanyal and Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee, the entire membership of the Hindustan Republican Association fell on the shoulders of Bismil
 isamen shahjahanpur se prem krishna khanna, thakur roshan singh ke atirikt ashfaaq ulla khaan kaa yogadan saraahneey rahaa
 When a plan was made to forcibly snatch money on the lines of the revolutionaries of Ireland, Ashfaq made available to his elder brother Riyasat Ulla Khan's license gun and two boxes of cartridges to Bismil to collect money for the party by putting robberies in the homes of the rich people
 
 kintu jab bismil ne sarkari khajaana luutane kii yojana banaayi to ashfaaq ne akele hi kaaryakarini meeting main iskaa khulkar virodh kiya

 When the iron strong chest was not broken by anyone, Ashfaq grabbed his master Manmathnath Gupta and took the cube and pushed it to full strength
 ashfaaq ke tijori todte hi sabhi ne unki fauladi takat kaa najaara dekha
 Otherwise, if the vault was delayed for a while and the police or army would come from Lucknow, many could have known in the competition; Then that Kakori scandal would have been given another name in history

 aakhirkaar ek raat ve vahaan se bhi rafuchakkar ho gayi or bihar ke usee jile daltonganj pahunch kar apni puraani jagah naam badal kar naukari shuru kar di
 One day, when the distinction opened, Ashfaq caught the train and went to Delhi and stayed at the house of an old friend, a native of his district Shahjahanpur
 yahan bhi vahi musiibat ashfaaq ke peeche lag gayi
 The girl of the friend, who was staying here, also started putting her pieces on Ashfaq

 It is said that the friend had assisted the police in arresting Ashfaq

 As soon as this information reached the Faizabad jail, Ashfaq wrote a letter to his brother Riyasat Ulla Khan on 29 November 1927, his brother-in-law Mohatrama Mazhurunnishan Begum on 15 December 1927 and sister Nalini Didi on his face on 16 December 1927 and got engaged in the worship of God

 After this, while talking about the benefits of hindu-muslim unity, Etihad like the Congress of Ahmedabad, taking away the ghost of white English, the country is giving an unmatched advice to renounce foreign fascination and hatred for the things of the country; Had requested "to every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late
but how can man die better, than facing fearful odds
for the ashes of his fathers, and temples of his gods
" Late poet Agnivesh Shukla of Shahjahanpur wrote this soulful poem in which he spent the last night of his life before hanging in the prison cell of Faizabad jail and gave the beautiful words of Hindi words to the storm of the hearts of the rising of Ashfaq
 is
 vikipedia ke pathakon kii seva main yahan us kavita ke chuninda ansh diye ja rahe hai: Bismil is a Hindu, he says, i will come again and again; Take a new born mother India! i will liberate you
 
 Yes, i should also say, but i am bound by religion; i am a Muslim, i am not able to say about rebirth

 ashfaaq kii laash ko unke pushtaini makaan ke saamne vaale bageeche main dafna diya gaya
 On his tomb, these lines were written as Ashfaq Ullah Khan on the marble stone: tera jeena tere marane kii badaulat hoga
 Ashfaq already knew that after his martyrdom, only the Liberal Party, or Congress, would come to power in India and there would be no discussion of the sacrifices of common people like him; Only the memorials of the rulers will be preserved
 tabhi to unhone ye qataa kahkar vartmaan halaat kii bhavishya-vaani bahut pehle san 1927 main hi kar di thi: It is a matter of great regret, the martyr is in love with Ashfaq and the shadow of sunshine !! ganimat he ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ne 200 rupee kaa maniorder bhejkar ashfaaq kii majaar par chat dalava kar use dhoop ke saaye se bachaa liya
 Ashfaq was a very good poet like Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 in donon kii shaayari kii agar tulana kii jaye to ratti bhar kaa bhi fark aapako najar nahin aayegaa
 In the first meeting itself, Bismil became interested in Ashfaq when in a meeting, he gave a reply to a lion of Bismil with his maestro liver Muradabadi's Ghazal fly
 jab bismil ne kaha- So Ashfaq responded by saying "amen" - ek roj kaa vakya he ashfaaq arya samaaj mandir shahjahanpur main bismil ke paas kisi kaam se gayi
 Incidentally, at that time Ashfaq Jigar was humming this ghazal of Muradabadi
 bismil yah sher sunakar muskaraa diye to ashfaaq ne puch hi liya-"kyon ram bhai! maine misra kuch galat kah diya kya?" is par bismil ne jabaab diya- "nahin mere krishna kanhaiya! yah baat nahin
 i respect Jigar Sahib very much, but he shot a big arrow on the old ground of Mirza Ghalib, saying that he was a beaten lion
 koi nayi rangath dete to main bhi irshaad kahata
 "ashfaq did not like this thing of Bismil; he said in a challenging tone -" Ram bhai! Now you fall into it, i will admit that your thinking is of a higher status than the liver and Mirza Ghalib
 " usee vakt pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne ye sher kaha- On hearing this, Ashfaq jumped up and hugged Bismil and said, "ram brother! i agree; you are masters of maestro too
" " After this, there was competition in Ashfaq and Bismil to say a great lion
 parantu agar dhyaan se dekha jaye to donon main ek tarah kii telepathy kaam karti thi tabhi to unke jajbaton main ekarupata dikhaayi detii he
 For example, Chand Misre is the spot: this lion of Bismil- ashfaaq kii is kata ke kitna kareeb jaan padataa he- These lines of Bismil were written after seeing the financial condition of the country as crisp- ashfaaq ke is sher se kitni adhik milti hai- Similarly, Bismil's agony on the barwadi of the country
 se miltaa julata ashfaaq kaa yah sher kisi bhi tarah apni kiafiyat main kamatar nahin- One of Bismil's great famous ghazal expectations - these lines of Sukhan - ashfaaq ko bahut pasand thim
 He had said only one lion in the same way, which is found in his unpublished diary as follows: - jinhen ashfaaq or bismil kii shaayari kaa vishesh yaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karnaa ho ve kisi bhi pustkaalay main jaakar swadhinata sangram ke krantikari sahitya kaa itihaas granthavali kaa doosraa bhaag dekh sakate hai
 Varna of Angadesh is found in Mahabharata according to which it was located in the eastern part of India
 mahabharat main surya devtaa kaa putr karn angadesh kaa raja tha
 Angadesh was previously the slave of King Jarasandha because there was no king of Anga
 jab duryodhana ne karn ko raja banaaya to log kehane lage ki angadesh kaa raja bananaa matlab mrityu ke mukh main janaa he
 Karna went to Angadesh and came to know that people say this because Angadesh was afraid of Jarasandha
 to karn ne jaraasandh ko haraaya va devtaa kuber kii sahaayta se angadesh ko dhanwaan banaaya
 Earlier, Angadesh lacked money, clothes, houses, food, army and many items, but after the boon of Kubera, money, clothes, houses, food and two Akshohini army were built in the country i

 Suryapuja used to take place at the place called "prabhas", the proof of which is found in the forest of Mahabharata
 prabhasko ‘‘bhaskarashetra’’ ke namase bhi janaa jaataa he
 "bhaskar" means Surya and "prabhas" means lighted
 is prakaar se ye dono hi shabd suryapuja ko suchit karte he
 There is a story in Bhavishya Purana about Suryapuja coming from Iran to India
 is kahani ke anusaar shri krishna or jambavati ke putr sankhane chandrabhaga nadi ke tat par suryamandir banwaaya tha
 Brahmino, a resident of that place, refused to worship, then he received the advice to invite "magh" Brahminoko from Sankhya
 in ‘‘mag’’ brahmino kii utpatti ke bare main mana jaataa he kii surya ko sujihv mihir gautra kii brahmin kanya nibhuksha se pyaar tha or unhi se ek putr ‘‘jardast’’ yaa ‘‘jarshabd’’ hua
 It is believed that this mug is a descendant of Brahmin
 saurashtra main suryapuja daris ke vakat se, yani ki vivy sarahadi vistaar unke shashanmen tha tab se arthath paanchavi shatabdi se prachlit thi aisi manyata he
 Evidence of the word "magi" or "magi" is found in the Bible and the present Aboti Brahmin is a descendant of the same Magh Brahmino
 is prakaar se bharat varsh main mag brahmino ko samb lekar aayaa
 According to the above mentioned conversation, the first temple of the Sun was on the banks of Chandrabhaga in "moolasthan" or "mooltan"
 tat pashchaat pure uttar-pashchim bharatmen suryapuja kaa failaava hua
 Five mills away from Dwarka is a small lake named Chandrabhaga
 jisake tat par samb-lakshmanaji ke mandir aaj bhi prasiddh he
 Dharasanvelka Suryamandir is known as "mag Mandir"
 peendtharak kshetra ke muniyonka apmaan karne ke kaaran samb ko kushtarog hua tha
 Maghrahminoko was summoned from Iran for treatment of this disease
 ant main suryaupasna se samb kaa kushtarog dur hua
 Even in the present time, the name "shamji" is more popular in Aboti Brahmin
 jo kii un logon kaa samb ke saath vishesh rishta suchit karata he
 How to divide the amount found in "angbhog" in the column of Jagatswamy temple of Bhinmal? Specific details are found on this subject
 is tippaneemen aboti evam vyas bhattaji ko mandir ke khaas vyakit ke taur par kuch daan dene kaa pramaan miltaa he
 The temple was built in the year 644 and was rebuilt in the year 889
 mandirmen jo stanbhalekh he wo 13veen shatabdika mana jaataa he
 From which it can be said that Aboti Brahmin was a worshiper of Suryanarayana in Marwar
 ek katha anusaar vajnabh ke saath aaye mag brahmin mathura gayi or vahaan se ve marwar pahunche
 Thereafter, he came to Dwarka on the Pragati of Vallabh sect

 From which 88128 A-vaginas originated from the sages who came to be known as "valkhilya"
 shri krishnavanshaj vajranabhane dwarikaamein shri jagadishamandir ke pun:nimarn ke avasar par jambudwip se brahmino ko bulaakar ke laane ke lie garudjico vinati kii
 Garudji brought these Brahminos on his beak and hence he came to be known as "abotti"
 shri laabhshankar purohit jo swany aboti brahmin gyatike hi he ve maanate he kii saurashtramen aboti brahmino kaa baseraa praachin kaal se he
 They believe that Aboti was the priest of Brahmin Yadavas
 lekin dwarika ke vinaash ke baad ve us sthal se chale gayi honge
 Shri Purohit says that Aboti Brahmin believed in Shri Krishna Puja very much and hence he is "vaishnava"
 aboti brahminomen suryapatni rannadevi kii bhaktibhi vishesh paayi jaati hai
 In the 9th volume of Bombay Gezitier, it is written that Aboti was the younger brother of Valmikiji, the great man of Brahmino
 or dwarikanagari main bhagwaan shri krishnane jab yajna karavaaya tab garudji anya brahminoke ataricat aboti brahminon ko bhi apane saath dwarika laaye
 Many scholars believe that the "ajoti Brahmin" is the Aboti Brahmin who is a descendant of spiritual spiritual Yajnavalkaya
 samay bitne ke saath ve ‘‘aboti brahmin’’ naam se prachlit hue
 Explaining the word "aboti", these scholars write that these Brahmin baths, worshiping, worshiping and performing spiritual activities wore "abot"
 at: inhen ‘‘aboti brahmin’’ namase prasidhdhi mili
 There is also a view of scholars and revisers that "maghrahmin" used to call himself "aboti"
 is baat ko samajhaate hue ve kehete he kii in brahminone vidharmee logon ke saamne na jhukkar swadharmako hi sachcha maanate hue ‘‘a-boat’’ rahena pasand kiya
 With this, these Mag Brahmin came to be known as "aboti Mag Brahmin"
 samay ke saath saath is namase kisi kaaran ‘‘mag’’ shabd kaa apbhransh ho kar ‘‘aboti mag brahmin’’ ke badale main ‘‘aboti brahmin’’ ke naam se prachlit hue
 Do in the preface to the book "history of Brahmin"

 Of
 shastri aboti brahminon ko mag brahmin ke vanshaj qaraar dete hue likhte he ki yah mat katai asambhav nahin he
 With the discussion of these Brahmins in this book, the most important thing about the development of Suryapuja in India has also been woven
 is puja kaa failaava karanevaale ye mag aboti brahmin hi he or vahi shri dwarikadhish mandir ke mukhya puujaari bhi the
 His Ishtadeva is Lord Dwarkadhish

 bela ke niyam bahut hi jatil hai
 The same can be said about them that they are based on familiar principles of sound

 Bella's strings are very light, which produces melodious tones with very high strings

 But the low elasticity of the tooth soon dulls these melodic vowels, which ultimately eliminates the tone of sound

 Nicholas Aniti made some improvements to it and his disciple Antinio gave it a form that continues to this day
