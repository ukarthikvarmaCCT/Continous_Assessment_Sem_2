 Generally speaking, prose is the language of simple practice of the person without speaking or writing
 isamen keval aanshik satya he kyonki isamen gadhykar ke rachanaatmak bodh kii avhelnaa he
 The language of ordinary behavior can also be called prose only when it is systematic and clear
 rachanaatmak prakriya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue gadhy ko manushya kii saadhaaran kintu vyasthit bhashaa yaa uski vishisht abhivyakti kahana adhik samichin hoga
 Prose is the form of simple and natural expression of man
 kavita or gadhy main bahut si baaten samaan hai
 Both have instrument words that are taken from the same repository without changing the meaning; Both the rules of grammar and syntax are the same, both resort to rhythm and pictorial dictation
 vardesworth ke anusaar gadhy or padya kii bhashaa main koi moolbhoot antar na to he or na ho saktaa he
 But despite all these similarities, poetry and prose are two different forms of expression
 samaan upkarnon ke prati bhi unke drushtikonon kii asamanta praaia: str par ubhar aati he
 But there is not only a stratigraphic or qualitative distinction between them, which is because poetry and prose are expressions of two different forms of man's mental process concerning the world and life
 unke udai or vikaas ke itihaas main iske pramaan maujuud he
 In his book Illusion and Reality, Codwell detailed the origins, social utility, and technique of poetry, writing that in the earliest form of literature, poetry was the elevation of the ordinary language of man
 us kaal kavita keval ragaatmak na hokar itihaas, dharm, darshan, tantra, mantra, jyotishi, niti or bheshaj sambandhi gyaan kaa bhi vahan karti thi
 Music, verses, rhyme, volume or accentuation, alliteration, repetition, metaphor, etc
 are used to impart to him
 kalantar main sabhyataa ke vikaas, samaaj ke vargeekaran, shramavibhaajan or udbuddha saahitiyik chetana ke kaaran pehle kii unmeshpurn bhashaa bhi vibhakt ho gai—kavita ne apane ko raagon kii unmeshpurn bhashaa ke rup main simit kar liya or vigyaan, darshan, itihaas, dharamshasre, niti, katha or naatak ne saadhaaran vyavhaar, arthath kathy kii bhashaa ko apanaaya
 As per requirement, each branch developed its own method of specific style, they were exchanged and the language of ordinary behavior was also affected by them
 manushya kaa maansik jagat apane ko bhashaa ke do vishisht roopon-kavita or gadhy-main pratibimbit karne laga
 There is a deep connection between the distinction between the motives of poetry and prose, and their approach to the tools of language
 kavita kii utpatti manushya ke samuhik shram ke saath hui
 The words essentially inspired the impulse of the whole group to perform the task at one point, with the help of music and dance
 fasal saamne nahin thi, beej bona tha
 The task of the words was to inspire the whole group to sow seeds by presenting an elusive picture of the crop
 codwell ke anusaar is mayavi sristi ke dwaara shabd shakti ban jate the
 The poem was a reflection of collective sentiments and aspirations and was intended to enlighten and organize them
 isliye kavita kaa sookshm kathy-uske tathyon kii vastu-nahin, balki samaaj main uski gadyatmak bhoomika-uske samuhik bhaavon kii vastu-kavita kaa satya he
 In social life, words are not just dry symbols of the objective world, but they are associated with simple and complex emotional contexts generated by life experience
 kavita shabdon ke shuddh pratikatmak arth kii upeksha nahin kar sakati, lekin uskaa mukhya uddeshy shabdon ke bhavatmak sandarbhon ko arthpurna sanghathan he
 Poetry is a new creation of words
 herbert read ke shabdon main kavita main chintan ke dauraan shabd baar baar nayaa janm lete hai
 In many languages, the meaning of the word used for the poet is shristha
 gadhy shabdon ke bhavatmak sandarbhon ke sthaan par unke vastunishth pratikatmak arth ko grahan karata he
 In keeping with this type of use of words in prose, Herbert Reid has called prose a formative expression, an expression in which words form brick-like constructs for use around the creator
 spasht he ki shabd ke vastunishth arth or uske bhavatmak sandarbh ko purnataya vibhakt karnaa sambhav he
 This is the reason that poetry cannot be utterly insensitive and prose cannot be utterly insensitive
 kavita or gadhy kii takneekon main pasparik aadan pradaan swaabhaavik he
 But where there is no realization of their specific religions, we have visions of Slut prose instead of poetry and Slut poetry instead of poetry
 vastunishth satya kii bhashaa kehane kaa arth yah nahin ki gadhy kavita se hey he, yaa uskaa saamaajik prayojan kavita se kam he, yaa vah bhashaa kii kalashunya abhivyakti he
 In fact, many works that are beyond the power of poetry are done by prose
 bahut pehle yah anubhav kiya gaya ki kavita kii chandamay bhashaa main vichaaron kaa tarkmay vikaas sambhav nahin
 Recognizing the distinct power of prose even in a less developed state of poetry, Aristotle in his famous treatise Retoric called it the realization of perception, the language to impress others with his thoughts, the main elements of which are rational order of thought, liveliness of description, Imagination, pictorial, spontaneity, rhythm, personification, utterance-beauty, ooze, moderation
 inamen se prayek bindu par kavita or gadhy kii seemayen milti hui jaan padati hai, kintu donon main inke prayog kii alag alag reetiyaan hai
 For example, their two elements, rhythm and pictogram, can be taken which are discussed a lot
 gadhy kii lay main kavita kii lay se adhik loch yaa vividhta hoti he kyonki gadhy main lay vakyarachana kii nahin balki vichaaron kii ikai hoti he
 Often in poetry
 lay ko vakyarachana kii ikai banaakar punrariti se prabhaav ko tivrata di jaati he
 Rhythm in prose is more pronounced than poetry
 praaia: lay ke madhyam se hi gadhykar ke vyaktiv kaa udghaatan hota he
 The life of poetry settles in the picture, while in prose, it is used to illuminate the idea with the utmost restraint
 angreji gadhy ke mahaan shailikar swift ke vishay main dow janson ne kaha tha : yah dusht kabhi ek roopak kaa bhi khatra mol nahin letaa
 The main thing is that all the capabilities of language in prose are subject to infallible expression of thought
 kavita main bhashaa ko alankrita karne kii swatantraaa aksar shabdon ke prayog or vakyarachana ke prati asaavdhaan rahane kii pravriti kaa kaaran he
 The misuse of adjectives is not in prose as much as it is possible in poetry
 kavita main sangeet ko aksar sasti bhavukta kaa aavaran bana diya jaataa he
 The importance of the story in prose works on it
 isaliye gadhy kaa anushaasan bhashaa ke rachanasaundarya ke bodh kaa uttam saadhan he
 T

 In Elliot's words, the qualities of good prose are the first and least requirement of good poetry
 gadhy kaa prarambh itihaas, vigyaan, saundaryashasre ityadi kii bhashaa ke rup main hua
 Later he moved from art to art

 Critical, which includes Science, Esthetics, Criticism, Philosophy, Religion and Ethics, Law, Politics, etc
, and affective, which includes subjective essays and dramas in addition to many of the above topics
 vishyon ke anusaar gadhy main pravaah, spashtataa, chitramyata, lay, vyaktigat anubhuti, alankaran ityadi kii matraaon main her pher kaa hona aavashyak hai, kintu gadhy kii kotiyon ke bich deevaaren nahin khadi kii ja sakati
 According to the interest and purpose of the writer, they are inserted into each other
 aadhunik yug main upanyaas gadhy kii vishesh prayogshaala ban gaya he
 Poetry remains on the path of words for a long time, prose has the amazing power to digest all kinds of words, new old, dry smooth
 bonami dabri ke anusaar sara acha jivit gadhy prayogtmak hota he
 The novel can make full use of this ability of prose
 aise prayog england kii apeksha america main adhik hue hai or vinium livis, hemingve, steen, fahonor, andersan ityadi ne apane prayogon ke dwaara angreji gadhy ko nayaa rakt diya he
 The power of rapid change in prose can also be estimated from the rapid development of Hindi prose, although its history is not very old
 bhavishya main gadhy ke vikaas kii or sanket karte hue ek angrej aalochak midilaton mari ne likhaa he : gadhy kii vistaar seemaa anant he or shaayad kavita kii upeksha uski sambhaavnaaon kii kam khoj hui he
 Manchu or Manchu is a language of the Tungusi-family spoken by the Manchu community settled in northeastern People's Republic of China

 The Shibe-speaking people are descendants of the Manchu who were stationed in the military cantonments of Xinjiang during the Ching Dynasty, dating back to 1644–1911 AD

 Though gender is not differentiated in Manchu language, in some words, the use of vowels to identify gender, eg 'aama' means 'father' while 'ame' means 'mother'
 maanchu main abhishleshan dekha jaataa he, jahaan shabdon kii mul jadon main akshar or dhvaniyaan jodakar unke arth main izaafaa kiya jaataa he
 For example, it is seen that adding 'MB', 'ambi' or 'imbi' makes reference to 'doing', 'coming' or any other type of reference: maanchu main swar sahyog bhi miltaa he, jisamen kisi shabd ke andar ke swaron kaa aapas main mail khaanaa zaruri hota he
 To some extent it is seen in all Altai languages

 Question: What is nausea? uttar : ghazal ke praarambhik shae'r ko matla kehete hai | matla ke donon misaron main tuk ek jaisi aati he | matla kaa arth he udai | urdu ghazal ke niyamanusaar ghazal main matla or maqataa kaa hona anivaary he varanaa ghazal adhuri maani jaati he
 But now-a-days, newcomers do not follow the traditional rule of ghazal makta or it may be that they do not want to go into the depth of this rule and without it they say ghazal
 kuchhek kavi matla ke bagaiyr bhi ghazal likhte hai lekin baat nahin banati he; kyonki gazal main maktaa ho yaa na ho, matla kaa hona laazmi he jaise geet main mukhdaa
 All of you will agree with me that if a song is not vocal then you can guess yourself
 gayak ko bhi to sur baandhane ke liye geet ke mukhade kii bhanti matla kii aavashyaktaa padati hi he
 If there are two nausea in the Ghazal, then the second one is called 'husnmatla'
 matle ke sher main donon panktiyon main kafia ore radif aate hai
 Another thing here is the fact that it is determined by the lion of the vessel or it is determined that the order of which will be followed in the entire ghazal or ghazal
 'husnemtala' : kisi ghazal main aarambhik matla aane ke baad yadi or koi matla aaye to use husn-e-matla kehete hai
 matla-e-sani: If more than one mutla occurs, the latter is confirmed or further clarifies the case of the previous one

 Bipin Chandra Pal was an Indian revolutionary
 bhartiya swadhinata andolan kii ruparekha taiyaar karne main pramukh bhoomika nibhaane vaali laal-bal-paal kii tikdi main se ek vipinchandra paal rashtravaadi netaa hone ke saath-saath shikshak, patrkaar, lekhak va vaktaa bhi the or unhen bharat main krantikari vichaaron kaa janak bhi mana jaataa he
 This trio of Lala Lajpat Rai, Balgangadhar Tilak and Vipinchandra Pal agitated against the British rule in 1905 against the partition of Bengal, which received a large public support
 'garam' vichaaron ke liye prasiddh in netaaon ne apni baat tatkaaleen videshi shaasha tak pahunchaane ke liye kai aise tareeke apanaae jo ekadam nae the
 These methods include boycott of finished products in Britain, avoiding clothing made in Manchester mills, strike in industrial and commercial establishments, etc
 unke anusaar videshi utpaadon ke kaaran desh kii arthvyavastha khastahal ho rahi thi or yahan ke logon kaa kaam bhi chhin rahaa tha
 He also put forward this idea in his movement
 rashtriya andolan ke dauraan garam dhade ke abhyuday ko mahatvapurn mana jaataa he kyonki isse andolan ko ek nai disha mili or isse logon ke bich jaagarukta badi
 He played an important role in creating awareness during the national movement
 unka vishwaas tha ki keval prere peetishan se swaraj nahin milane vaala he
 Vipinchandra Pal, born on 7 November 1858 in a thriving Kayastha household in Habibganj district of undivided India, was against his ideals and established orthodox beliefs in public life as well as in his private life
 unhone ek vidhwaa se vivaah kiya tha jo us samay durlabh baat thi
 For this, he had to break up with his family
 lekin dhun ke pakke paal ne dabaavon ke baavjood koi samjhauta nahin kiya
 When disagreeing with someone's views, he does not hold back in expressing it
 yahan tak ki sahamat nahin hone par unhone mahatma gandhi ke kuch vichaaron kaa bhi virodh kiya tha
 Affected by leaders like Keshav Chandra Sen, Shivnath Shastri, Pal was sentenced to six months in prison for refusing to testify against Arvind
 iske baad bhi unhone gavaahi dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Pal, who worked for the national interest all his life, died on 20 May 1932
 paal kii kuch pramukh rachanaaen is prakaar hai : Vipin Chandrapal worked for a long time as a writer and journalist
 1886 main unhone silahat se nikalne vaale 'paridarshak' naamak saptahik main kaary armbh kiya
 Some of his major magazines are as follows: islam main allaah ke naam : parampara ke mutabik, islam main allaah ke kam se kam 99 naam hai, jinhen' asmau allaahi al-husnaa " allaah ke sundar naam " ke rup main janaa jaataa he 
 According to the 9th-century collection of Hadiths, the tradition of having "99 names" is correct, while the tradition of the actual list of 99 names given by some collectors in at least three different forms is called Poor
 in soochiyon main adhiktar naam quran ke paath se liya gaya hai, maukhik parampara yaa sunnat main alpsankhyak ke saath kiya gaya he
 Lists of names vary because choosing more than 99 features requires different propositions and references, and is chosen that way
 vibhinn ullekhanaayen 99 naamon kii alag-alag suchiyaan dete hai
 In the hadith, Muhammad has called Allah by many names
 sankhya 99 kii utpatti vishesh rup se kamjor maani gai haddees ke liye jimmedaar hoti he, haalanki kam-se-kam uddhrut haddees hai jinhen pramanik mana jaataa he or ek hi bindu kaa samarthan karata he
 According to the correct Muslim hadith, 35: 6475: quran allaah ke "sabase khubasurat naam" ko sanderbhit karata he
 Gerhard Boeing refers to Sura 17: 110 as the locus classicus, in which explicit lists of 99 names were attached to the Quranic commentary
 aayaat 22:22-24 main aisi soochiyon main shaamil darjan se adhik divya upakalaayon kaa samooh shaamil he
 Mystic philosopher Ibn Arabi speculated that 99 names are "external signs of the inner mysteries of the universe"
 haalanki sabhi paaramparik rup se soochibaddh 99 naam main se adhikansh quran main kahin nahin paae jate hai
 Others are taken from the hadith
 suchi jaruri bhi nahin he, kyonki quran or haddees se 99 se adhik divya naamon ko joda ja saktaa he
 There is no universal agreement among Muslims as to what really counts as the name of Allah, and what does not
 iske atirikt, jabaki kuch naam keval quran main hai, or anya keval haddees main hai, kuch aise naam hai jo donon main dikhaai dete hai
 Different sources give different lists of 99 names
 nimnlikhit suchi jami tirmizi main paae gaye ek par aadhaarit he
 Other hadiths, such as al-bukhari, right Muslim, ibn Maja, al-hakim or ibn 'asakir, have variations
 sabhi abu hurairah ke sankalan naamon kii suchi kaa mul visheshta hai
 al-tirmizi commented on his list: "this hadith is poor; it is narrated from various passages on the authority of Abu Hurairah, but we do not know of the mention of names
 Apart from this, there are many stories
 " jaafar al-sadiq, suffaan ebn 'uyanah, ebn hazam, al-kurtubi, ebn hajar al-asakalani samet kai praarambhik muslim mufassirin, 99 naamon kii soochiyon ke apane sanskaran die hai

 It is said to be "the greatest name of Allah", "the one he is called will answer
 " According to a hadith mentioned by Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, some names of Allah are also hidden from mankind
 javashan kabir main arabi ke 1000 se adhik naam soochibaddh hai 
 The Arabic names of Allah are used as theophoric names commonly used in Muslim cultures throughout the world, including non-arabic speaking societies
 jabaki allaah ke naam swayan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit hai or kisi vyakti ke die gaye naam ke rup main unka upyog dharmik rup se anuchit mana jaataa he, phir bhi anaupchaarik naam nishchit lekh al ko hataakar yaa abdu ke naam par
 For example, a person cannot be named al-karim or al-malik, but is simply named Karim or Malik - "king"), as well as Abd ul-karim or Abd ul-malik
