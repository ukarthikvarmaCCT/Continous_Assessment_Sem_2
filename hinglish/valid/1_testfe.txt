 braille paddati ek tarah kii lipi he, jisko vishwa bhar main netraheenon ko padhane or likhane main chhukar vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 This method was invented in 1821 by Louis Braille, a blind French writer
 yah alag-alag aksharon, sankhyaon or viraam chinhon ko darshaate hai
 When Braille was blind, his father got him admitted to the Royal National Institute for the Blind Children's in Paris
 us skool main "velantin hou" dwaara banaai gai lipi se padhai hoti thi, par yah lipi adhuri thi
 Once in this school, Captain Charles Barbier, an officer of the French army, came for a training and gave a lecture about the "night Writing" or "sonography" script read by the soldiers in the dark
 yah lipi kaagaj par aksharon ko ubharkar banaai jaati thi or isamen 12 binduon ko 6-6 kii do panktiyon ko rakhaa jaataa tha, par isamen viraam chihn, sankhya, ganitiya chihn aadi nahin hote the
 Braille got this idea from Waheem
 lui ne isi lipi par aadhaarit kintu 12 ke sthaan par 6 binduon ke upyog se 64 akshar or chihn vaali lipi banaayi
 Not only punctuation marks but also mathematical symbols and musical notations could be written in it
 yahi lipi aaj sarvamaanya he
 Louis was just 15 when he composed the script
 san 1824 main purna hui yah lipi duniya ke lagbhag sabhi deshon main upyog main laai jaati he
 There are 6 dots in each rectangular cell, which are slightly raised
 yah do panktiyon main bani hoti hai
 Different 64 characters can be made in this size
 cell kii bai pankti main upar se neeche 1,2,3 bane hote hai
 Similarly, 4,5,6 are made on the right side
 ek dot kii ausatan oonchai 0
02 inch hoti he
 It has a special technique of reading
 braille lipi ko padhane ke liye andhe bacchon main itnaa gyaan hona aavashyak he ki wo apni ungali ko vibhinn dishaao main cell par ghuma saken
 By the way, there is no standard way of reading it around the world
 braille lipi ko slate par bhi prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Apart from this it can also be presented on Braille typewriter
 aadhunik braille script ko 8 dots ke cell main viksit kar diya gaya he, taaki andhe logon ko adhik se adhik shabdon ko padhane kii suvidha uplabdh ho sake
 The Braille script cell with eight dots now has the ability to read 256 characters, numbers and punctuation marks instead of 64
 braille paddati ko varnmaala ke varnon ko kuta rup main nirupit karne vaali sabase pratham prachlit pranali kah sakate hai, kintu braille lipi netraheenon ke padhane or likh sakane ke upaay kaa pratham prayaas adhyay nahin he
 Even before this, in the 17th century, Jesuit Francisco Lana of Italy made a lot of efforts to write and read for the blind
 braille lekhan ko panne par kuch nukile staylas dwaara peeche se aage ko ubhare hue nishaan dwaara dots ko ankit kar likhaa ja saktaa he
 In such a situation it can be written by looking at the image in the mirror to write behind the page, because it is difficult to write inversely
 aisa karne heti braille-tiperiter yaa perkins briller dwaara likhaa ja saktaa he
 It can also be printed by Braille embosser attached to the computer
 braille ko braille ambosar par likhane hetu 8-bindu paddati main adyatit kiya gaya he
 In it, some additional points have been added down to the old style
 ab ye 4 bindu ooncha or 2 bindu chaudaa ho gaya he
 The additional points are numbered 7 and 8
 8-bindu code kaa ek laabh ye bhi he ki ek akshar kaa cese sidhe akshar vaali cell main diya jaataa he evam sabhi print hone vaale aski kairactors ek hi cell main likhe ja sakate hai
 All 256 combinations possible by 8-dots are possible in the Unicode standard
 6-bindu vaali braille lipi ko braille aski naan se surakshit rakhaa gaya he
 The first 10 letters of the English alphabet and numbers up to 1–10 are written using only the top four dots
 bindu 3 ke prayog se agle das akshar, bindu 6 se antim chah akshar evam praayah prayogneey angrezi shabd and, for, of, the, and with aadi likhe ja sakate hai
 By removing the letter u from z to point-3 and removing the five word marks, nine digraphs form the letter W
 e, 1 B, 2 si, 3 D, 4 E, 5 F, 6 G, 7 H, 8 I, 9 J, 10 K, 11 L, 12 M, 13 N, 14 O, 15 P, 16 Q, 17 R, 18 S, 19 T, 20 U, 21 V, 22 W, 23 X, 24 Y, 25 Z, 26 aage capital akshar he Is the number next apostrophy full stop coma Semicolon vismayaadibodak chihn Quotation marks, question marks start * uddhran chihn band Bracket * hifan note: * prashnsuchak chihn dikhaane ke liye bindu 2-3-6— prayog kiye jate hai, khulte uddhran chihn ke samaan hi
 Therefore, it is only by writing the points before or after a word that you will know what this sign is
 * khulte va band hote braggit samaan chihn dwa chihnit hai
 Therefore, it will be known only by experiment whether the bracket is opening or closing
 shabd and / AND Letter f / ch akshar SH Letter st / st akshar tha / TH This is just a sample of the contracts used in Grade-2 Braille
 is bare main adhik jaankaree hetu braille tronscripshan dekhen
 The Unicode standard included Braille in September 1999
 braille patternon ke unicode U+2800 se lekar U+28FF tak hai
 Bharti Braille uses only the first 64 of them

 The year 975 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 The language-based versions of Visual Studio 2005 as well as the Visual Studio 2008 and 2005 Professional editions are available as a free download for students through the Microsoft Dreamspark program
 vijual studio 2010 abhi release ummidavaar he or ise aam logon dwaara muft main downlod kiya ja saktaa he
 Finally, Visual Studio does not support any programming language, solution or tool
 isaki bajaay, yah vibhinn kaaryaatmakataa ko jodne kii anumati detaa he
 Specific functionality is coded as a vspackage
 sthapit ho jane par, yah kaaryaatmakataa ek seva ke rup main uplabdh hoti he
 The IDE provides three services: svssolution, which provides the ability to calculate projects and solutions; svsuishell, which provides windowing and UI functionality; And svsshell, which handles vspackage registration
 iske atirikt, IDE sevaaon ke bich samvaad kaa talmail karne or ise sakasham banane ke liye bhi uttaradaayi hota he
 All editors, designers, project types and other tools are implemented as vspackages
 vspackages ke abhigaman ke liye vijual studio COM kaa prayog karata he
 Visual Studio's SDK also includes a Managed Package Framework, a set of managed wrappers around com-interfaces that allows packages to be written in any CLI compliant language
 haalanki, MPF vijual studio COM interphes dwaara ujagar kii jane vaali sari kaaryaatmakataa pradaan nahin karata
 iske baad sevaaon kaa prayog vijual studio IDE main kaaryaatmakataa jodanevaale anya packejon main se kisi ke bhi nirmaan ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Support for programming languages is added using a specific vspackage called Language Service
 ek bhashaa seva vibhinn interphes paribhaashit karti he, jise vspackage kriyanvayan vividh kaaryaatmakataa ke liye samarthan jodne hetu kriyanvit kar saktaa he
 Functionalities thus added include syntax coloring, statement execution, brace matching, parameter information tooltip, member lists, and error markers for background compilation
 yadi yah interphes kriyanvit kiya jaataa he, to kaaryaatmakataa us bhashaa ke liye uplabdh hogi
 Language services are to be implemented on a per-language basis
 yah kriyanvayan us bhashaa ke liye parcer yaa compiler se code kaa punarprayog kar saktaa he
 Language services can be implemented in native code or managed code
 mul code ke liye mul COM interphes yaa babel fremawork kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 MPF for managed code includes wrappers for writing managed language services
 strot niyantran ke liye vijual studio main koi antarnirmit samarthan shaamil nahin hota, lekin vah is aadhaar par MSSCCI ko paribhaashit karata he ki koun-sa strot niyantran tantra IDE ke saath ekikrut ho saktaa he
 MSSCCI defines a set of functions, which are used to implement various source control functionalities
 MSSCCI ko pehali baar vijual sorsef ko vijual studio 6
0 ke saath ekikrut karne ke liye prayog kiya gaya tha, lekin baad main ise vijual studio SDK ke madhyam se shuru kiya gaya
 Visual Studio 
NET 2002 used MSSCCI 1

 vijual studio 2005 or 2008 donon MSSCCI sanskaran 1
3 kaa prayog karte hai, jo punahnamakaran or vilop sancharan ke saath hi atulykaalik prarambhikaran ke liye samarthan bhi jodta he
 Visual Studio supports implementing multiple instances of the environment
 ye instons vibhinn registry hikes kaa prayog unki vinyas avasthaaon ke bhandaran ke liye karte hai or unhen unke appid dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he
 These instances are initiated by an appid-specific 
exe, which selects an appid, sets the root hive, and initializes the IDE
 ek appid ke liye panjikrut kiye gayi vspackages ko us appid ke liye anya vspackages ke saath ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Visual Studio Express product versions of Visual Studio are created using various appids
 vijual studio express sanskaran utpaada apane swayan ke appid ke saath install kiye jate hai, lekin standard, profeshnal or team sweet utpaada ek hi appid ko saajha karte hai
 As a result, the Express version can be installed in parallel with other versions, unlike other versions that update the previous installation itself
 profeshnal sanskaran main standard sanskaran ke vspackages kaa ek mukhya-samucchy or team sweet main anya donon sanskarnon ke vspackages kaa mukhya-samucchy shaamil hota he
 The appid mechanism leverages Visual Studio Shell in Visual Studio 2008
 kisi bhi anya ] kii tarah vijual studio main bhi ek code sampadak shaamil hota he, jisamen intelicense kaa prayog karke na keval veriables, functions or methds ke liye, balki bhashaa ke nirmaan khandon, jaise lups or queries, ke liye bhi cintax hiliting or code purnataa ke liye samarthan shaamil hota he
 intellisense support is also provided for the languages included, as well as for XML and for cascading style sheets and javascript when developing web sites and web applications
 autokampulit suzav ek modvihin list box main pop-ap hote hai, jo ki code editor ke sheersh par achchhadit hota he
 In Visual Studio 2008 and later it can be temporarily made semi-transparent, so that the code that is interrupted by it can be seen
 code sampadak kaa prayog sabhi samarthit bhashaaon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Visual Studio Code Editor also supports setting bookmark rites in code for quick operation
 anya sanchaalanaatmak sahaaytaaon main saamaanya text khoj or regex khoj ke saath hi code blox or vriddhishil khoj shaamil hote hai
 The code editor also includes a multi-object clipboard and a task list

 a management tool for code blocks is also built-in
 ye upkaran tairti hui vindos ke rup main pradarshit hote hai, jinhen prayog na kiye jane yaa screen ke baaju main rakh diye jane par swachaalit rup se chhip jane hetu set kiya ja saktaa he
 Visual Studio's code editor also supports parameter recording, variable and method renaming, interface quotation and other code refactoring, including encapsulation of class members within properties
 vijual studio becoground compylation kaa samarthan karata he
 When the code is being written, Visual Studio compiles it in the background to provide feedback about syntax and compilation errors, which are marked by a red wavy underline
 chetavaniyon ko ek hari adhorekha ke dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Background compilation does not generate executable code because it requires a different compiler than the compiler used for executable code
 becoground compylation sabase pehle microsoft vijual basic main prastut kiya gaya tha, lekin ab ise sabhi sammilit bhashaaon ke liye vistaarit kiya ja chukaa he
 Visual Studio includes a debugger, which can act as both a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger
 yah prabandhit code or mul code donon ke saath kaary karata he or iskaa prayog vijual studio dwaara samarthit kisi bhi bhashaa main likhe anuprayogon kii dibging ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, it can be combined with the processes currently being implemented, so that they can be inspected and debugged
 yadi kriyanvit ho rahi prakriya ke liye strot code uplabdh ho, to kriyanvayan ke saath hi yah code ko pradarshit karata he
 If the source code is not available, it may display disassemblies
 vijual studio dibgar anek memory damp bana saktaa he or saath hi unhen baad main dibging ke liye lod bhi kar saktaa he
 Multithreaded programs are also supported
 dibgar ko vijual studio ke baahar kriyanvit ho rahe kisi anuprayog ke vifal hone par prarambh kiye jane ke liye bhi vinyasit kiya ja saktaa he
 The debugger also allows setting breakpoints and watches
 brakepoints shart par aadhaarit ho sakate hai, jiskaa arth he ki ve us samay prarambh hote hai, jab koi shart purna hoti he
 The code can be proceeded sequentially, ie one line at a time
 yah functions ko dibag karne ke liye inke bheetar pravisht ho saktaa he yaa yadi maanviya nirikshan ke liye function body uplabdh na ho, to vah ise chhodkar aage bhi bad saktaa he
 The debugger supports edit and continue, that is, it also supports editing the code as soon as it is debugged
 dibging karte samay, yadi kisi bhi veriable par mouse suchak le jaaya jaae, to iskaa vartmaan maan ek tultip main pradarshit hota he, jahaan ise icchaanusaar sanshodhit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 During coding, the Visual Studio Debugger allows specific functionalities to be started manually from the intermediate tool windows
 methd ke liye parameter emidiat vindo par bheje jate hai
 Visual Studio includes a visual designer to assist in the development of applications
 in upkarnon main shaamil hai: Visual Studio allows developers to write extensions for Visual Studio to enhance its capabilities
 ye vistaaran vijual basic main "plag-in" ho jate hai or isaki kaaryaatmakataa ko badhaate hai
 Extensions come in the form of macros, add-ins and packages

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 bhautik brahmand vigyaan, khagol vigyaan or khagoleey yantriki main, gupt urja, urja kaa ek kaalpanik rup he jo sampoorn antariksh main vyaapt hota he evam jisamen brahmand ke vistaar kii dar ko badhaane kii pravriti hoti he
 Dark energy is the most popular way of expressing recent observations and experiments according to which the universe seems to be expanding at an accelerating rate
 brahmand vigyaan ke maanak model main, gupt urja ko vartmaan main brahmad ke kul urja-dravyaman kaa 74% mana jaataa he
 Two proposed forms of dark energy are the cosmological constant, which is a constant of the energy density that is homogeneous in space, and scalar fields such as abstracts or moduli, which are dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space
 jo adish kshetra antariksh main sthir rahete hai unke yogadan aam taur par brahmand sambandhi sthiraank main shaamil kiye jate hai
 The cosmological constant is physically equivalent to vacuum energy
 adish kshetra jo antariksh main parivartit hote hai unka brahmad sambandhi sthiraank se antar karnaa kathin ho saktaa he kyonki parivartan atyant dhimaa ho saktaa he
 In order to understand the change in the rate of expansion over time, it is necessary to understand high-precision measurements of the expansion of the universe
 saamaanya saapekshata main, vistaar dar kaa vikaas brahmand sambandhi avasthaa sameekaran ke dwaara maandand ke anuroop kiya jaataa he 
 Measuring today is one of the greatest efforts of observational cosmology today, evaluating the equation of the state of dark energy
 brahmand sambandhi sthiraank ko brahmand vigyaan ke maanak effelardblyoo meter pranali main jodne se lamda-sidim model utpann hota he, jise paryvekshanon ke saath yatharth mail ke kaaran brahmad vigyaan kaa "model maanak" kaha gaya he
 In a recent effort dark energy has been used as an important component to construct a cyclic model for the universe
 1998 main, hai-zed supernova anusandhan dal dwaara tip laa supernova ke prakashit paryvekshanon ke baad 1999 main supernova brahmand vigyaan pariyojna shuru huijisne suzav diya ki brahmad kaa vistaar twarit gati se ho rahaa he
 Since then, these observations have been confirmed from several independent sources
 brahmand microwave kii prishthbhumi ke maapan, gurutviya lensing, evam brahmad kii vyapak sanrachana or saath hi saath supernova ke unnat maapan lamda-sidim model ke saath sangat bane rahe hai
 Supernovas are useful for cosmology because they are excellent standard lights throughout the cosmological distances
 ve brahmad ke vistaar itihaas kaa maapan kisi vastu se duuri evam iske lambey tarang dairghy kii taraf iske visthaapan ke bich sambandh kii taraf dekhakar karne dete hai, jo yah bataata he ki yah hamase kitni teji se peeche hat rahaa he
 According to Hubble's law, the relationship is broadly linear
 lambey tarang dairghy kii taraf visthaapan kii maap karnaa apekshaakrit rup se aasaan he, lekin kisi vastu se duuri kaa pataa lagaana adhik kathin he
 Typically, astronomers use standard lights: objects for which the intrinsic brightness, absolute magnitude, is known
 yah vastu kii duuri kaa maapan iske vaastavik rup se dekhi gai chamak, yaa spasht pariman se karne detaa he
 Type La Supernova is the best-known standard light in all cosmological distances due to its extreme, and highly consistent, brightness
 supernova ke haal ke prekshan 71
3% gupt urja evam 27
4% kaale padaarth evam berion sambandhi padaarth ke sammishran se nirmit brahmad ke anuroop hai
 The existence of dark energy, whatever the form, is necessary to match the measured geometry of space with the total matter of the universe
 abhi haal main hi, dablyooemapi antarikshayan dwaara maapan kii disha se bhinn gun vaale bhautik shaastra main brahmand microwave prishthbhumi ) kaa maapan, yah suchit karata he ki brahmad lagbhag chapata he
 For the size of the universe to be flat, the mass / energy density of the universe must be somewhat similar to the critical density
 siembi dwaara maap kiya gaya, brahmad main padaarth kaa kul pariman, kranthik ghanatv ke keval 30% ke lagbhag hota he
 This means an additional form of energy for the remaining 70%
 sabase haal ke dablyoo em e pi ke paryvekshan 74% gupt urja, 22% kaale padaarth or 4% saadhaaran padaarth se nirmit brahmad ke anuroop hai
 The theory of mass structure, which determines the formation of structure in the universe, also suggests that the density of matter in the universe is only 30% of critical density
 twarit brahmadia vistaar se hokar photon ke guzarane par ve chapata kiye jane vaale gurutvkarshan sambhavit kuen evam pahadiyaan utpann karte hai, jisase vishaal superwoid evam supercluster ke saath sanrekhit siembi main thande dhabbe evam garm dhabbe utpann hote hai
 This so-called delayed coordinated Sachs – Woolf effect) is a direct sign of latent energy in a flat universe, and was recently identified as being of high importance by Ho et al
 And Giannattonio
 is gupt urja kii prakruti chintan kaa vishay he
 Concealed energy is considered to be very homogenous, which is not very dense and does not interact with any other fundamental forces except gravity
 chunki yah bahut saghan nahin he- mote taur par prati cubic centimetre 10−29 gram-prayogshaala main iskaa pataa lagane ke liye isaki kalpana karnaa kathin he
 Only dark energy has such a profound effect on the universe, which is 74% of the density of the universe, because it otherwise fills in the blanks
 do pramukh model akaash evam brahmadia sthiraank hai
 Both models include the common feature that dark energy must have negative pressure
 brahmad ke vistaar dar main dekhe gaye twaran ko vyakt karne ke liye gupt urja ko apni vaastavik prakruti se swatantra ek rinatmak dawaab kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 According to general relativity, pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction to other objects in the same way as its mass density
 yah isliye hota he kyonki padaarth ko gurutvkarshan prabhaav utpann karne ke liye prerit karne vaali bhautik maatra tanaav-urja tensior hoti he, jisamen kisi padaarth kaa urja ghanatv evam iskaa daab tathaa gaadhaapan hota he
 In the Friedman – Leameter – Robertson – Walker metric, it can be shown that a strong constant negative pressure in all the universe produces an acceleration in the expansion of the universe if the universe is already expanding, or produces a thaw in the universe If there is already a contraction in the universe
 adhik yatharth rup main, brahmad ke maap kaarak a ̈ { \ displaystyle { \ ddot {a}}} kaa doosraa vyutpann dhanatmak hota he yadi brahmad kii avasthaa kaa sameekaran hota he { \ displaystyle \ !} w { \ displaystyle w} This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes classified as "gravitational repulsion" which is a colorful but perhaps misleading expression
 vastav main rinatmak dabaav dravyamanon ke bich gurutvakarshan sambandhi parsparik kriya ko prabhavit nahin karata he - jo aakarshak bana rahata he - balki iske bajaay yah brahmand sambandhi paimaane par brahmad ke samgr vikaas ko parivartit kar detaa he, jiske parinamswaroop aam taur par brahmad main upasthit dravyamanon ke bich aakarshan ke baavjood brahmad kaa twarak vistaar hota he
 The simplest explanation of dark energy is that it is simply "the cost of having space": that is, some amount of space has some internal, fundamental energy
 yah brahmad sambandhi sthiraank he, jise kabhi-kabhi greek akshar λ ke naam se lamda kaha jaataa he, ek pratik jis kaa prayog is raashi ko ganitiya rup main vyakt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Since energy and mass are related to e = mc 2, Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that it will have a gravitational effect
 ise kabhi-kabhi ek nirvaat urja kaha jaataa he kyonki yah rikt nirvaat kaa urja ghanatv he
 In fact, most theories of particle physics predict vacuum instability that would give this type of energy to the vacuum
 yah casimir prabhaav se sambandhit he, jisamen un pradeshon main ek chota khinchaav hota he jahaan vaastavik kanon ko viksit hone se jyamitiya rup se roka jaataa he
 Cosmological constants are estimated by cosmologists on the order of 10–29 g / cubic cm, or about 10–120 in reduced Planck units
 haalanki, kan bhautikee ghati hui plank ikaayiyon main prakritik maan 1 kaa purvanumaan karte hai, jo ek vishaal asangati he jise ab tak nahin samajha gaya he
 The negative pressure in the cosmological constant is equal to its energy density and therefore accelerates the expansion of the universe
 brahmand ke sthiraank ke rinatmak dawaab hone ke kaaran ko paaramparik ooshmapravagiki se samajha ja saktaa he; paatr main kaary karne ke liye urja ko paatr ke bheetar se nasht karnaa chahie
 The work done to change the volume dv must be equal to the change in energy −p dv, where p is the pressure
 lekin vastav main nirvaat urja ke box main urja kii maatra aaytan main vruddhi hone se bad jaati he, kyonki urja ρv ke baraabar hoti he, jahaan ρ brahmand sambandhi sthiraank kaa urja ghanatv he
 Therefore, p is negative and, in fact, p = −ρ
 ek pramukh samasya yah he ki adhikansh kwantum kshetra siddhanth kwantum nirvaat kii urja se ek vishaal brahmad sambandhi sthiraank kaa purvanumaan karte hai, jisamen se 100 se adhik pariman kram atyadhik vishaal hote hai
 This would almost need to be canceled, but not at all equally by a huge post bearing the opposite symbol
 kuch adhisamametiya siddhanton ke liye ek brahmand sambandhi sthiraank kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo vastav main shunya hota he, jo sahaayak nahin hota he
 Current scientific consensus leads to the extrapolation of empirical evidence where it is relevant to predictions, and correcting theories until a more elegant solution is found
 takneekee taur par, iske parinamswaroop khuli aankh se dekhe jane yogya prekshanon ke viruddh pareekshan siddhant utpann hota he
 Unfortunately, since the known error-margin in the constants predicts more with respect to the fate of the universe than the current state of the universe, many such "esoteric" questions remain unknown
 maanak model main brahmad sambandhi sthiraank ko shaamil karne se ek or samasya utpann hoti he: arthath kam ghanatv vaale padaarthon ke algaav kshetron ke saath samaadhaanon kaa prakaton
 asatatya brahmad sambandhi sthiraank ko nirdisht kiye gaye dawaab ke purv ke pratik ko bhi prabhavit karata he, jo badalakar vartmaan rinatmak dawaab se aakarshak ho jaataa he, jab koi purv ke brahmad kii taraf peeche dekhtaa he
 a systematic, model-independent evaluation of the supernova statistic incorporating cosmological constants in the standard model indicates that there are systematic errors in these data
 supernova aankade ek teji se badhate hue brahmad ke vistaar ke liye ek aprihaary sakshya nahin hai jo maatr ek failaav ho saktaa he
 Evaluation of the numerical value of the WMAP and supernova data as evidence of localized spacing at lower substance densities than in other locations in our local group suggests a potential conflict in the analysis used to support the cosmological constant Was born haal ke ek saidhantik jaanch ne paryvekshan kii bhautik seemaa ko vyakt karte hue brahmand sambandhi kshitij par pahunchne vaale paryvekshak se sambandhit brahmand sambandhi samay, dinaank, kisi simit antaraal ke liye vichlan, dies kaa pataa lagaaya
 This is a key component required for a complete explanation of astronomical observations, particularly those related to the nature of dark energy
 brahmand sambandhi sthiraank ke rup main gupt urja kii pahchaan aankadon ke saath sangat prathit nahin hoti he
 These findings should be considered as shortcomings of the standard model, but only when a term for vacuum energy is included
 apni samasyaon ke baavjood, brahmand sambandhi sthiraank kai drushti main brahmadia twaran kii samasya kaa sarvaadhik kifayati samaadhaan he
 a number successfully explains the abundance of observations
 is prakaar, brahmand vigyaan kaa vartmaan maanak model, lamda-sidim model, brahmad sambandhi sthiraank ko ek aavashyak suvidha ke rup main shaamil karata he
 In the abstract model of dark energy, the observed acceleration of the measuring factor is generated by the potential energy of a dynamic field, called the abstract field
 saar tatv brahmad sambandhi urja se is arth main bhinn hota he ki yah sthaan evam samay main bhinn ho saktaa he
 To allow it to become clumpy and structure-like, the area must be very light so that it has a large Compton wavelength
 ab tak saar tatv kaa koi sakshya uplabdh nahin he, lekin ise nakaara bhi nahin gaya he
 It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration in the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant
 kuch vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki saar tatv kaa sabase acha sakshya oinstin ke samatulyata siddhant ke ulalanghanon se evam sthaan evam samay main aadharbhoot sthiraank kii bhinnata se aayega
 adish kshetra kaa purvanumaan maanak model evam string siddhant ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, lekin brahmad sambandhi sthiraank samasya ke sadrush samasya utpann hoti he: pun:samanyikaran kaa siddhant yah purvanumaan karata he ki adish kshetron ko brihad dravyamanon ko grahan karnaa chahie
 The problem of cosmic coincidence questions why cosmic acceleration started
 yadi brahmadia twaran brahmad main isse pehle shuru hua to gallexi jaisi sanrachanaon ko utpann hone kaa samay nahin mil paata evam jivan, kam se kam ham log ise jitna jaanate hai, ke astitv kaa samay nahin mil paata
 maanav jivan siddhant ke pratipadak ise apane tark ke samarthan ke liye sahaayak maanate hai
 However, many abstract models have a so-called exploratory behavior that solves this problem
 in modelon main, saar tatv kshetra main ek ghanatv hota he jo padaarth-vikiran samanta hone tak vikiran ghanatv kii baariki se khoj karata he, jo saar tatv ko gupt urja ke jaisaa vyavhaar karne ke liye prerit karata he or antat: brahmad par aadhipaty rakhata he
 This naturally sets a lower energy scale for dark energy
 2004 main, jab vaigyanikon ne brahmand sambandhi aankade ke saath gupt urja ke vikaas ko kaam ke upyukt banaaya, to unhone yah paaya ki avasthaa kaa sameekaran shaayad brahmad sambandhi sthiraank kii seemaa ko upar se neeche kii taraf paar kar chukaa tha
 a no-go theorem has been proven to provide this scenario with at least two degrees required for latent energy models
 yah paridrishy ko tathakthith quintum paridrishy kaha jaataa he
 Some special examples of abstract energy are phantom energy, in which the energy density of the element actually increases with time and k-essence, which has a non-standardized form of kinetic energy
 unamem asaamaanya gun ho sakate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, phentom urja ek bada daraar utpann kar sakati he
 Some theorists believe that dark energy and cosmic acceleration are a failure of general relativity on a much larger scale than the supercluster
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata ko sanshodhit karne ke adhikansh prayaas yaa to saar tatv siddhant ke samatuly yaa prekshanon ke saath asangat sabit huye hai
 Alternative ideas of dark energy originate from string theory, brain cosmology, and holographic theory, but they have not yet proved irrefutable like abstracts and cosmological constants
 string siddhant ke sambandh main, nechar patrika main ek lekh main varnit he: String theory, which is popular among many atomic physicists, makes it possible, even desirable, to think that the observable universe is just one in 10500 of the larger universe
 vibhinn brahmadon main nirvaat urja kaa bhinn maan hoga or kai yaa adhikansh main yah vastav main vishaal hoga
 lekin yah hamaare vaale main chota hona chahie kyonki keval aise hi brahmad main hamalogon ke jaise prekshak viksit ho sakate hai
 In the same article, Paul Steinhardt criticizes string theory in relation to dark energy, saying that "


 anthropological science and contingency do not explain everything
" 


 main us baat se niraash hum jise adhikansh siddhantvaadi maanane ke liye taiyaar hai"
 Yet another, a "fundamentally conservative" class of propositions seeks to interpret observational figures with the aim of a more sophisticated use of valid theories rather than the introduction of latent energy, for example, the gravity of density inhomogeneities
 Seeks to focus on disjoint effects, or electrically weak symmetric disjunctions in the early universe
 yadi ham antariksh ke ausat se adhik rikt pradesh main sthit hote to awalokit cosmik vistaar dar ko bhul se samay yaa twaran main antar maan liya jaataa
 Another class of theories is present with an attempt to express a comprehensive theory of both dark matter and dark energy as a single phenomenon that modifies the laws of gravity on different scales
 is prakaar ke siddhant kaa udhaaharan kaale drav kaa siddhant he
 Another form of propositions is based on the possibility of a double metric tensor for space time
 yah tark diya gaya he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke samay vipareet samaadhaanon ke liye sangatta hetu aise dohare metric kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, evam yah ki kaale padaarth evam gupt urja donon ko saamaanya saapekshata ke samay vipareet samaadhaanon ke sandarbh main samajha ja saktaa he
 Cosmologists estimate that the acceleration began roughly 5 billion years ago
 usase pehle, yah sochaa jaataa he ki kaale padaarth evam baireon ke aakarshak prabhaav ke kaaran vistaar kaa mandan ho rahaa tha
 In the expanding universe, the density of dark matter decreases more rapidly than dark energy and ultimately the dark energy is dominated
 vishesh rup se, jab brahmad kaa aaytan duguna ho jaataa he, kaale padaarth kaa ghanatv aadha ho jaataa he lekin gupt urja kaa ghanatv lagbhag aparivartit he 
 If the acceleration continues indefinitely, the end result will be that galaxies outside the local supercluster will move outside the cosmic horizon: they will no longer be visible at all, as the velocity of their line of sight exceeds the speed of light 
 yah vishesh saapekshata kaa ulanghan nahin he or prabhaav kaa istemaal unke bich sanket bhejne ke liye nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Territories can be defined meaningfully
 balki, yah unke bich kisi prakaar ke samvaad ko roktaa he kyonki vastu sampark se baahar ho jate he
 With the retreat of the rest of the universe, however, the group of neighboring galaxies of Earth, Galaxy and Virgo will remain untouched
 In this scenario, a group of local neighboring galaxies would eventually die of heat, as was also thought of a similar galaxy, before the measurements of cosmic acceleration dominated the universe
 brahmad ke bhavishya ke bare main kuch bahut hi pratyaashit vichaar hai
 One suggestion is that phantom energy produces divergent propagation, which would mean that effective sources of dark energy continue to increase until it has established dominance over all the forces of the universe
 is paridrishy ke tahat, gupt urja antat, gallexiyon evam saura pranaaliyon sahit, gurutvkarshan se bandhi hui sabhi sanrachanaon kii dhajjiyaan uda degaa, evam swayan parmaanuon kii dhajjiyaan udaane ke liye vidyutiya evam nabhikeey shaktiyon ko apane niyantran main kar legaa, jisase ant main brahmad kaa ek "bada tukdaa" ho jayega
 duusari taraf, gupt urja samay ke saath fail sakati he, yaa aakarshak bhi ho sakati he
 Such uncertainties create the possibility that gravitation can still be dominated and create a universe that compresses itself into a "big creak"
 Some scenarios, such as the cyclic model suggest that this can happen
 jabaki prekshanon ke dwaara in vichaaron kaa samarthan nahin kiya ja saktaa he, inase inkaar bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Measuring acceleration is important to determine the ultimate fate of the universe by the superstition theory
 brahmand sambandhi sthiraank sarvapratham oinstin ke dwaara gurutvakarshan kshetra sameekaran kaa ek sthaayee samaadhaan praapt karne kii ek prakriya ke rup main pratipaadit kiya gaya jisamen gurutvakarshan ko santulit karne ke liye gupt urja kaa prabhavi dhang se upyog karte hue ek sthitik brahmad kaa nirmaan hota he
 This process was not only a crude example of fixing the universe, it was soon realized that Einstein's static universe would actually be unstable because local inhomogeneities would either cause a very spontaneous expansion or contraction of the universe
 santulan asthir he: agar brahmad kaa dhire-dhire vistaar hota he, to vistaar nirvaat urja chhodti he, jo or adhik vistaar utpann karti he
 Likewise, a universe that contracted slowly will continue to shrink
 These types of disturbances are unavoidable due to the skewed distribution of matter throughout the universe
 adhik mahatvapurn baat, edwin habal dwaara kiye gaye prayogon ne yah dikhaaya ki brahmad kaa vistaar hota maaloom pad rahaa he evam vah bilkul hi sthitik nahin he
 Einstein famously described his failure to predict the dynamic universe as opposed to the static universe as his biggest mistake
 is ahsaas ke baad, brahmand sambandhi sthiraank ko ek aitihaasik jigyaasa ke rup main purna rup se andekha kiya gaya
 Alan Guth proposed in 1970 that a negative pressure field, similar to the concept of dark energy, could have induced cosmic diffusion into the very early universe
 prasar kii abhidharana he ki kuch pratikshepak bal, gunatmak rup se gupt urja ke samaan, ke parinamswaroop maha visphot siddhant ke baad dhire-dhire brahmad kaa biihat evam ghaataanki vistaar hua
 Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang
 haalanki, prasar hamaare dwaara aaj dekhi ja rahi gupt urja kii tulana main adhik ucch ghanatv par hona chahie tha evam jab brahmad ek second kaa ek ansh maatr tha to ise puri tarah se samaapt maan liya gaya
 It is unclear whether any relationship, if any, exists between dark energy and diffusion
 prasaarit model ko sweekrut kar lene ke baad, brahmand sambandhi sthiraank ko vartmaan brahmad ke liye apraasangik mana gaya
 The term "dark energy", which has been the epitome of Fritz Zwicky's "dark matter" since 1930, was coined by Michael Turner in 1998
 us samay tak, big baing ke newcliosinthesis khoye hue dravyaman kii samasya evam vyapak sanrachana sthapit kii ja chuki thi, evam kuch brahmad vigyaniyon ne yah siddhant dena shuru kar diya tha ki hamaare brahmad kaa ek atirikt ghatak tha
 The first direct evidence for dark energy was obtained from rapid expansion supernova observations in Ris et al
 And later confirmed in Perlmuter et al
 iskaa parinaam lamda-sidim model tha, jo 2006 se uttarottar kathin brahmad sambandhi prekshanon kii shrinkhalaaon ke saath jari he, jinamein se naveenatam 2005 kaa supernova ligasi survey he
 The first result obtained from SLNS shows that the average behavior of the dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological constant with an accuracy of up to 10%

 In mathematics, if f and g have the following relation with any real value, and the differential function f and g at all points, then g is called the Lajandar transformation of f
 is roopaantar kaa naam francisi ganitagya aadriyein maari lajaandra ke naam par padaa he
 Where d is the symbol for the derivative and -1 on the right side, denoting the inverse function
 yah aasaani se dikhaaya ja saktaa he ki g, f kaa lajaandra roopaantar ho to f, g kaa lajaandra roopaantar hoga For example, the function f = x 2 2 { \ displaystyle f = { \ tfrac {x ^ {2}} {2}}} and the function g = - p 2 2 { \ displaystyle g = - { \ tfrac {p ^ {2}} {2}}} are Lazandar versions of each other
 ek vishesh sthiti main, yadi falan f ek uttal falan ho to iskaa lajaandra roopaantar ƒ* nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he- Let f = cx2 defined on R, where c> 0 is a fixed constant
 For x* fixed, the function x*x – f = x*x – cx2 of saanchaa:mvar has the first derivative x* – 2cx and second derivative −2c; there is one stationary point at x = x* / 2c, which is always a maximum
 Thus, I* = r and Clearly, namely f ** = f
 Let f = x2 for x ∈ i =
 For x* fixed, x*x − f is continuous on saanchaa:mvar compact, hence it always takes a finite maximum on it; it follows that I* = R
 The stationary point at x = x* / 2 is in the domain if and only if 4 ≤ x* ≤ 6, otherwise the maximum is taken either at x = 2, or x = 3
 It follows that The function f = cx is convex, for every template: Mvar
 Clearly x * x - f = x is never bounded from above as a function of the template: Mvar, unless x * - c = 0
 Hence f * is defined on i * = {c} and f * = 0
 One may check involutivity: of course x*x − f* is always bounded as a function of x* ∈ {c}, hence i ** = R
 Then, for all saanchaa:mvar one has and hence f ** = cx = f
 Let be defined on x = Rn, where template: Mvar is a real, positive definite matrix
 Then mold: Mvar is convex, and has gradient p − 2ax and Hessian −2A, which is negative; hence the stationary point x = A−1p / 2 is a maximum
 We have X* = Rn, and Syed Rahim Zillur Mudassar Hussain was a Bangladeshi judge

 yadrichhik-abhigam smriti dwaara jaani jaati he), computer data sangrahan kaa ek rup he
 Today it takes the form of integrated circuits that allow stored data to be accessed in any order, ie, random)
 shabd yadrichhik is prakaar is tathy ko sanderbhit karata he ki data kaa koi bhi hissaa apni bhautik sthiti or chaahe yah data ke pichley hisse se sambandhit ho yaa na ho, in sabaki parvaah kiye bagaiyr nirdhaarit samay main waapas aa saktaa he
 This system works with the frequency of bus, then it is called SDRAM, which is most commonly used in computers nowadays
 isaki In contrast, storage devices such as magnetic disks and optical disks depend on the physical speed of the recording medium or the readable end
 in upkarnon main, gati main data sthanantaran se adhik samay lagata he or agali vishay-vastu kii bhautik sthiti ke aadhaar par punarprapti samay badalata rahata he
 The term RAM is often related to volatile or volatile type memory memory modules) where information is lost when power is stopped operating
 adhiktar rome or nor-flash kahe jane vaale ek prakaar ke flash memory sahit kai anya prakaar kii memory ram bhi he
 There are two types of RAM
 static RAM aur daynemic RAM hoti he
 An early type of massively writeable random-access memory was magnetic core memory developed from the years 1949 to 1952 and later most computers until the development of static and dynamic integrated RAM circuits in the late 1960s and early 1970s
 It was used in isse pehle, "mukhya" memory prakaaryon ko karyanvit karne ke liye computaron main riley, vilamb line memory yaa vibhinn prakaar kii vaikum tub vyavasthaaon kaa istemaal hota tha jinamein se kuch yadrichhik abhigam hote the or kuch nahin
 vaikum tub tryod se or baad main asatat transister se nirmit kundiyon ko apekshaakrit chote or tej memory jaise yadrichhik-abhigam register bainkon or registeron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Prior to the development of integrated ROM circuits, permanent random-access memory was often constructed using semiconductor diode matrices driven by address decoders
 aadhunik prakaar ke riteble ram aam taur par data kaa ek bit yaa to flip-flop avasthaa main jaise esaram, yaa kisi sandharitra main aavesh ke rup main jaise diram, ipirome, iipirome or flash main sangrahit karte hai
 Some types have circuitry to detect and / or repair random faults called memory errors in stored data using parity bits or error correction codes
 read-only prakaar ke ram, rome, aavesh kaa bhandaaran karne ke bajaay chaynit transistaron ko sthaayee rup se sakriy / niskriy karne ke liye dhaatu ke ek mask kaa prayog karata he
 Since both ASRAM and DIRAM are unstable, other forms of computer storage, such as disks and magnetic tapes, are used as permanent storage in traditional computers
 kai nae utpaada data ke rakrakhaav ke liye iske bajaay flash memory par nirbhar rahete hai jab unka upyog nahin hota he jaise pidie yaa laghu sangeet vadak
 kuch vyaktigat computaron, jaise kai tej computaron or netbukon ne chumbakeey discon ko bhi flash drivon ke saath badal diya he
 With flash memory, only the nor type is capable of true random access, allowing direct code execution and is therefore often used instead of ROM; The low-cost NAND type is typically used for bulk storage in memory cards and solid-state drives
 microprocesar kii tarah, memory chip bhi lakhon transistaron or sandharitron se milakar bana ek ekikrut paripath ) hota he
 The most common form of computer memory, dynamic random access memory), combines a transistor and a capacitor to form a memory cell that represents only one bit of data
 sandharitra main soochna kii ek bit hoti he — ek 0 yaa ek 1
 transister ek switch kii tarah kaam karata he jo memory chip kii niyantran circuitary ko sandharitra ko padhane yaa uski avasthaa main parivartan karne kii anumati pradaan karata he
 Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy that includes CPU registers, on-die asraum cache, external cache, dieram, paging system, and virtual memory or swap space of a hard drive
 memory ke is samgr pool ko kai developaron dwaara "ram" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he, yahaan tak ki vibhinn upatantron main ram main yadrichhik abhigam sangya se pare mul avadharana kaa ulanghan karte hue bilkul alag-alag abhigam samay ho saktaa he
 Even under a hierarchy level such as DIRAM, special rows, columns, banks, ranks, channels, or intergroup associations of components make the access time variable, although not to the extent that the recurring storage medium or tape becomes variable
 The overall goal of using the memory hierarchy is to achieve the maximum possible average access performance while reducing the total cost of the entire memory system, following the registers and access times with slower hard drives below)
 kai aadhunik vyaktigat computaron main, ram, modul ke ek sahaj unnat rup main aati he, jinhen memory modul yaa diram modul kehete hai or jinka aakaar lagbhag chuing gam ke tukdon ke samaan hota he
 These can be replaced immediately when they are damaged or when more storage capacity is required due to changing requirements
 jaisaa ki upar suzav diya gaya he, kam maatra vaali ram ) ko hard-drivon, sidi-rome or computer tantra ke kai duusare hisson ke saath-saath sipiu or madraboard ke anya isi main bhi ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Many CPU architectures and operating systems are capable of performing a task known as "swapping" if a computer slows down on RAM during a rapid application cycle
 gamagaman ek prishthan fil kaa upyog karata he jo asthaayee rup se atirikt kaaryakari memory ke rup main prayukt hard drive kaa ek kshetra he
 Continuous use of this mechanism is called thrashing and is generally undesirable because it slows down the overall performance of the system, mainly because hard drives are much slower than RAM
 read-rhite kii kshamta rakhane vaale anya bhautik upkarnon ke naam main "ram" kaa prayog ho saktaa he: udhaaharan ke taur par, dividi-ram 
ek anukraman vidhi kaa naam bhi "yadrichhik abhigam" he: isiilie discs bhandaaran ko aksar "yadrichhik abhigam" # fil or input / output, platform, maanak sanskaran # yadrichhik abhigam]], anukramit fil) kaha jaataa he kyonki pathan sira, data ke ek bhaag se duusare bhaag main apekshaakrit turant gati kar saktaa he or iske bich ke sabhi data ko padhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 However, the final "M" is important: "RAM") always refers to solid-state equipment
 ram praayah computer kii mukhya kaaryakari memory ke sandarbh main online baatcheet kaa ek ashulipi yaa sankshep lekh he
 Software can "partition" a portion of a computer's RAM and allow it to act as a faster hard drive called a RAM disk
 yadi prayukt memory non-volatile na ho, to computer ko band karne par ram discs main sangrahit data kho jaataa he
 However, volatile memory can keep its data intact when the computer shuts down if it has a separate power-source, usually a battery
 kabhi-kabhi, apekshaakrit kam abhigam samay kii suvidha praapt karne ke liye rome kii samagriyon ko esaram yaa diram main pratilipit kar diya jaataa he dhimi ho sakati he)
 uske baad rome chip ko niskriy kar diya jaataa he jab inishilised memory sthanon ko badalakar pate ke usee khand main sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 This process is commonly used in both computer and embedded systems, sometimes called shadowing
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ke taur par, vishisht vyaktigat computer ke bios main praayah "shadow bios kaa prayog karen" kahalaane vaala ek vikalp yaa usee tarah kaa koi vikalp hota he
 Once activated, the functions based on the data of the BIOS ROM will use the DRAM locations instead
 Depending on the sister, this may or may not result in increased performance
 kuch tantron main laabh kaalpanik ho saktaa he kyonki pratyaksh hardware abhigam ke paksh main booting karne ke baad bios kaa upyog nahin hota he
 Of course, some less free memory is available when shadowing is active
 kai nae-nae prakaar ke non-volatile ram vikasadhin he jo vidyut aapurti ke band ho jane par bhi data ko surakshit rakhenge
 chumbakeey surang prabhaav kaa upyog karke carbon nanotub or drushtikon yukt praudyogikiyon kaa prayog hua
 In the first-generation MIRAM, a 128-kilobyte magnetic RAM) chip was manufactured in the summer of 2003 with 0

 ]] ne san 2004 main ek kriyasheel carbon nanotub memory prototip 10 ) saarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 Whether or not some of these technologies will eventually gain a significant share of the market either from DRAAM, ASRAM or from flash-memory technology remains to be seen, however
 san 2006 ke baad se, "thos avasthaa vaale drive" uplabdh ho gaye hai jinaki kshamta 64 gigabite se adhik or kaary-nishpaadan paaramparik discon se kahin adhik he
 This development has begun to blur the definition between traditional random access memory and "disk" and has narrowed their performance gap in particular
 plastic chumbakon ke kshetra main bhi sakriy anusandhan hua he jo prakaash par aadhaarit chumbakeey vipareetata main pher-badal karte hai
 Some types of random access memory such as "ecorem" have been specifically designed for server farms where low power consumption is more important than speed
 "memory kii diwaar", sipiu or sipiu chip ke baahar sthit memory ke bich kii gati kii bad rahi vipareetata he
 One of the main reasons for this contrast is the limited communication bandwidth outside the chip boundaries
 varsh 1986 se 2000 tak, sipiu kii gati main 55% kii vaarshik dar se sudhaar hua jabaki memory kii gati main keval 10% kaa hi sudhaar hua
 Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become a major hindrance in computer performance
 vartmaan main, kuch had tak pramukh bhautik baadhaon ke kaaran or kuch had tak vartmaan sipiu dizin dwaara kuch arthon main pehle se hi memory kii diwaar ko prabhavit karne ke kaaran sipiu kii gati ke sudhaar main kaaphi kami ai he
 Intel has briefly revealed these reasons in its Platform 2015 documentation)
 "sabase pehle, chunki chip kii jyamiti simat gai he or clock kii aavritiyon main vruddhi hui he isliye maujuuda transister ke risaav main vruddhi hui he jiske parinamswaroop bijli kii khapat or garmi main tezi aa jaati he
 

 Secondly, the advantages of faster clock speeds are somewhat negated by memory latency because memory access time has not been able to keep pace with the clock's increasing frequencies
 teesri baat yah he ki kuch anuprayogon ke liye paaramparik dharawahik architekchar kam sakasham hote ja rahe hai jabaki procesar main tezi aa rahi he or iske saath-saath yah laabh ko bhi kam kar de rahe hai taaki aavriti vruddhi ko kisi duusare tareeke se karidaa ja sake
 iske atirikt, kuch had tak thosavastha vaale upkarnon ke tahat prerakta ke utpaadan ke sadhano main seemabaddhata ke kaaran, sanket sancharan main pratirodh-dharita ) kii vilambtaa main vruddhi ho rahi he kyonki suvidha ke aakaar chote ho gaye he jo ek atirikt aadchan daal rahaa he jisase aavriti kii vruddhi kaa pataa nahin chalata he
 " sanket sancharan main aarasi kii vilambtaa ko clock dar banaam ipisi : paaramparik microarchitekchar ke maarg kaa ant main bhi darj kiya gaya he jo san 2000 or san 2014 ke bich vaarshik sipiu kaary-nishpaadan sudhaar main adhik-se-adhik ausatan 12
5% kaa anumaan prastut karata he
 Data from Intel processors clearly shows that recently the performance improvement of the processor has decreased
 baharhaal, pichley ]] processron kii tulana main intel ke nae processron, ]] main kaaphi sudhaar dikhaai diya he; adhik sakasham architekchar ke kaaran kaary-nishpaadan main vruddhi hui he jabaki clock dar main giravat ai he
 Unlike ordinary models, modern SDRAM materials are not immediately lost when the computer is turned off; Rather, the material disappears, a process that takes only a few seconds at room temperature but which can be increased to minutes at a lower temperature
 yahi vajah he ki kisi bhi sangrahit data ko saadhaaran kaaryakari memory modul) main punah praapt karnaa sambhav he
 This is sometimes referred to as a cold boot attack aka ice-man attack

 From 1944 to 1968, the US dollar was convertible into gold through the Federal Reserve System, but it was only after 1968 that the central bank was able to convert the dollar into government gold reserves, and after 1973, any individual or institution was able to reserve US gold from the reserves

 Government international reserve assets in a flexible exchange rate system allow the central bank to buy domestic currency, which prints the legal currency as a liability for the central bank
 yah kriya gharelu mudra ke mulya ko sthirataa pradaan kar sakati hai
 In an effort to influence the exchange rate, central banks around the world have sometimes assisted in the purchase and sale of international reserves
 jaise hi kendriya bank maudrik niti lagu karata he videshi mudra kii arakshit nidhiyon kii maatra tadnusaar badal sakati he
 The central bank that implements a fixed exchange rate policy may face a situation where demand and supply can lead to low or high pricing of currency
 In a flexible exchange rate phase, these procedures operate automatically with any additional demand or supply by buying or selling foreign currency with the clearing of the central bank

 Foreign currency operations that are uncontrolled will be caused by the expansion or contraction of the amount of domestic currency in circulation and therefore directly affect monetary policy and inflation: an exchange rate target cannot remain independent of the inflation target
 Countries that do not target fixed exchange rates are considered to have floating exchange rates and these allow the market to set exchange rates only; In countries that have exchange rates, other tools of monetary policy are generally preferred and may limit the type and amount of foreign currency exchange intervention

 If demand increases then to maintain the same exchange rate, the central bank can issue more domestic currency and buy foreign currency, which will increase the amount of foreign currency reserves
 In this case, the value of the currency is maintained downwards; Since there is no) the supply of domestic money keeps increasing, due to which domestic inflation can arise
 chunki kamjor mudra kii raksha ke liye uplabdh videshi arakshit nidhi kii raashi simit he, faltah videshi mudra sankat yaa avamulyan pratifalit ho saktaa he
 For a currency whose demand is very high and keeps increasing, the reserves of foreign currency can theoretically be continuously accumulated, although in the end the increase in the supply of domestic money can cause inflation and increase the domestic currency Demand may decrease
 In practice, some central banks may create sufficient reserve reserves at the same time, with the aim of stopping the value-addition of their currency through open market operations

 Generally large reserves of foreign exchange allow the government to manipulate the government exchange rate to provide a more favorable economic environment

 Fluctuations in the currency exchange market result in gains and losses in the purchasing power of reserves

 For example, China has huge US dollar-denominated assets, but if the US dollar weakens in the currency exchange market, the result of this decline is the relative loss of wealth for China

 Therefore, a central bank must maintain its sovereignty over exchange rate manipulation to continuously increase the amount of its reserves
 videshi mudra ke arakshit bhandar vyaaj kii ek choti si vaapasi pradaan karte hai
 However, this decrease can also be mitigated by the lack of purchasing power of that currency over the same period due to inflation, which can in effect lead to negative returns, known as "half-fiscal costs"

 iske do bhaag hai : purvavidhan or navvidhan 
 The first half of the Bible is also the scripture of the Old Testament Jews
 bible ishwarprerit he kintu use apaurushey nahin kaha ja saktaa
 God has inspired various writers of the Bible in such a way that they can be called their own creations even though they are Godsized
 ishwar ne bolkar unase bible nahin likhavai
 He certainly tended to write with the inspiration of God, but he has written it according to the characteristics of his culture, style and ideology
 at: bible ishwariya prerana tathaa maanviya parishram donon kaa sammilit parinaam he
 The history and account of what God did for mankind and the Jews and the reaction of man to it is the theme of the Bible
 bible gudh darshanik satyon kaa sankalan nahin he balki isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki ishwar ne maanav jati kii mukti kaa kya prabandh kiya he
 In fact, the Bible is a history of the implementation of divine liberation that began in the Old Testament and was edited by Jesus in the New Testament
 at: bible ke donon bhaagon main ghanishtha sambandh he
 The events of the life of Jesus are laid out by the events of the Old Testament
 new testament main dikhalaayaa gaya he ki muktividhan kis prakaar isa ke vyaktitv, chamatkaaron, shiksha, maran tathaa punarutthan dwaara sampann hua he; kis prakaar isa ne carch kii sthapana kii or is carch ne apane praarambhik vikaas main isa ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko kis drushti se dekha he ki unamem se kya nishkarsh nikaala he
 Incidentally, things related to cosmic knowledge have also come up in the Bible; There is a full impression of the immediate assumptions on them because the Bible hardly wants to give any direction about them
 maanav jati ke itihaas kii ishwariya vyakhya prastut karnaa or dharm evam mukti ko samajhnaa, yahi bible kaa pradhan uddeshy he, bible kii tatsambandhi shiksha main koi bhranti nahin ho sakati
 There is also a description of the sin of humans at many places

 isamen khaas taur par chaar shubhasandesh hai jo isa kii jeevani kaa unke chaar shishyon ke naam se kisi or ke dwaara varnan he : matti, luka, yuhanna or marakus
 The religion book of Judaism is also the Bible, but it contains only the Old Testament

 The remaining 21 texts of the New Testament are Shiksha-pradhan, namely 14 letters of Sant Pal, two letters of Santpeeter, three letters of the saint Yohan, the gospel writer, one letter by Saint Yakub and one by Saint Jude
 sant paal ke patr yaa to kisi sthanvishesh ke nivaasiyon ke liye likhe gaye hai yaa kisi vyaktivishesh ko 
 There is no doubt about the authenticity of the letters of the Hebrews, which are included in the Bible, but despite being influenced by the thoughts of Sant Pal, their author will be someone else

 The ancient religion of the Bible is spiritually combined with the Quran and Islam and is associated with a chosen elite
 musa athwa isa, abraham yaa suleman muslimon main shraddhey naam hai
 The Bible is different from this
 yah kai granthon kaa nichod he
 This is the entire story of the Jewish people and perhaps the most varied Jewish experiences among the ancient people

 Sometimes they were demeaned, conquered and enslaved
 is jati ne kabhi apane shatruon ko vijit kiya tathaa unki shakti aajamaai, phir bhoomisaat kar daalaa 
 It is the aspiration and inspiration and triumph and defeat of one such public who is described in the Bible with amazing vivacity
 usne hamen apane abraham or musa jaise mahaan netaaon, daaud or suleman jaise mahaan raajaaon tathaa mahaan avtaron ke vishay main gyaan karaayaa he jinhone samay samay par utpann hokar apane drudh vachanon dwaara anuchit maarg par arudh janata ko tokaa
 It has been the same sequence till Sevanola

 The Bible also shows about bloodpipes like Abraham, fierce violent kings and uncivilized queens
 yah janata kii aitihaasik ghatnaon or tithiyon kii samhita he
 In the inevitable small boundaries of a book, despite its virtually ethnic history, it is full of surprising truths

 History remains the same but its nature changes
 yahudiyon kaa bhayankar ishwar hataa diya jaataa he or kalpana main bhartiya dhang kaa ek snehi ishwar ubhad aata he
 Perhaps the first blurred images of such a trend are found in some incarnations of the heart of ancient Dharmanium itself, especially in Isaiah etc
 kintu ishwar ke sambandh main yah ibranio kii koi anupatik kalpana nahin he
 His feeling was eye to eye

 Thus, he disqualified the author of this new religious belief and eventually gave it to him
 kintu us din galgotha naamak sthaan par cross se pravaahit raktabinduon kii dhara ne ek nae dharm ko janm diya
 The Christian people see him as a symbol for themselves and preach the words of Jesus
 is prakaar, buniyadi taur par dhairya or prem ne twara or ghrinaa par vijay praapt kii
 No one thought that those who indulged in the homogenously recited singing found in secret and furnished tendons or cottages inside Rome, which were previously only suitable for the sake of the deposits of the fierce Roman festivals, would one day only see the royal power of Rome We will not only shake you, but will build a better and more glorious Rome-like Sanatan Nagar in the coming days

 Although here he was not a Roman corps but saints with tables and clergymen, who passed away in thousands laughing to death, he preached biblical messages among Europe's rambunctious and uncivilized people
 bible ke shabdon ne un asabhyon kaa aanshik rup se sabhy banaaya
 Thus the Church or Institute of Christianity continued to dominate Europe's mind for at least a thousand years, with its full coverage

 But the same church, which originally developed to fight against tyranny and oppression, now itself became the biggest bearer of oppression and autocracy
 pun: bible janata ko sankatmukt karne ke liye aage ai
 This in itself is a contradiction

 Originally written in Hebrew and Arabshek, it was 400 AD Was translated into Latin by St
 Jerome C
 and this authentic translation was used by the Roman Catholic Church
 kintu latin sarvasaamaanya logon kii bhashaa na thi, duusare isai dharmaguru bhashaaon yaa foohad boliyon main hue bible ke anuwaadon se bahut chidhate the
 This was not only because the Christian leaders wanted to maintain their position of privilege, although there was an abundance of it, they were afraid that their words would not lose the power and intent of the divine words by being translated into the colloquial language

 "lollard" was the first to raise his voice in England

 Their leader, Vikliffe was a man of amazing courage and erudition
 usne anubhav kiya ki vichaarparivartan ke liye logon ko isa ke upadeshvachanon kii jaankaree aavashyak he
 For this, translation of the Bible into the public language became necessary
 is prakaar us kaal kii naveen chetana vicliff kii aawaaj main dhvanit hui
 Wikliffe occurred at a time when English prose had little power to express the full opulence and beauty of the Bible
 iskaa apana anuwaad bahut hi ruksh he
 Perhaps he had no ear for English-speaking music

 Nouns have a special place in syntax, and the imperative of divisions today was not even there at that time, because it was a great real fantasy that the Jews had their own and their sensitiveness to words
 is prakaar kuch shabdon main hi samathrya or tivrata hoti thi kyonki ve shabd lagu na hokar beej rup main hote the
 Apart from this, the theme of ancient Dharmanium is widely accessible

 Finally, the New Testament contains the words of Jesus in the law
 at: unhen samajhane main thodi bhi chook athwa bhram ho jane par na keval uljhan hi bad jaati he balki sampurna aashay hi bhrasht ho jaataa he
 It is no wonder, therefore, that the churches did not consider the translations appropriate
 phir bhi wiliam tinden ne bible ke angreji anuwaad kaa pratham pramanik prayaas kiya
 He used the original Italian version which was prepared in Italy in the fifteenth century and also resorted to a Wikliffe translation made in the fourteenth century
 anuwaad ke liye usne saralatam angl shabdon ko chunaa or is prakaar jansadharan kii bhashaa se naikaty sthapit karte hue apana anuwaad prastut kiya 
 Tyndale also used Erasmus and the Zurich version of Luther and Zinggli

 But it was only near Tyndale's Bible that Kaberdale was a great preacher
 vah tindel kii spashtataa ko nibaahane main safal hua he kintu usne use vaagmiyata se bhar diya he
 That is why he proves to be an extraordinary craftsman of prose

 Seven years of tireless hard work produced the authentic version

 Scholars wisely left Tyndale's clarity and Coverdale's lyrical eloquence to a large extent

 Not only did it fill the Hebrew with its innate beauty and elemental power intact, but in proper terms, it acquired a "pictorial" and lyrical quality that was the result of excellent English talent
 yah janata kii boli main ghulmil gaya he
 Scholars say that his 93 ऽ words are in English
 uskaa shabd kabhi bhi praapt yaa siikhaa hua nahin he tathaa anuwaad main gruhit shabd bilkul hi nahin he
 It was also necessary to clarify the intention as there should be no scope for rigor in the book, which is considered to be the book of God
