 It is the practice of historians that the year before 1 AD was the year 1 BC

 kehete hai—ityadi
 But according to the principles of Mathematics, this practice is unscientific; Because from this, as an example, 3 BC Between 5 and 2 CE, 5 years were spent, there is such confusion, while in reality the gap is only 4 years

 Here we will only describe till the census
 saamaanya manyata yah he ki isvi san isa messiah ke janm se gina jaataa he, parantu katipay vidwaanon ke matanusaar usamen lagbhag 4 varsh kii bhul he
 There is an important context in the calculation of AD, due to which, there is a possibility of mistake of up to 13 days in the census
 aajkal samaanyat: i
 san varsh main 365 din hote hai or prati chaar varshon main ek varsh 366 din kaa hota he
 The 4 centuries have 366 days in just one century in 4 years
 shatabdiyon ke dinon kii yah vishisht vyavastha pracheen kaal main nahi thi
 By 1582 AD, one year per four years was counted as 366 days in all the years including the century
 365 din ke varsh ko saamaanya varsh tathaa 366 din ke varsh ko adhivarsh kehete hai
 In 1582 AD, Pope Gregory made two reforms in AD
 pratham sudhaar yah tha ki shatabdiyon ke dinon kii vyavastha naveen rup se kii gai, jo aajkal prachlit he
 The system was that the century which can be divided from 400 to the remaining is the leap year; All other centuries are normal years
 yah niyam jyotish ke aadhunik yantron se paane gaye sookshm sayan varshmaan ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 By neglecting this rule, 10 days were extended from the beginning of the year AD to 1582 AD
 is nayi vyavastha ko naveen paddati or purv kii paddati ko pracheen paddati kehete hai
 In chronology, the events up to October 4, 1582 AD are expressed in the ancient way and the events after that in the new method

 Accordingly, the 1932 year of this Vikram Samvat would have started in August, ie, Chaitra month in 1857

 Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow
 isaki visheshta rakt koshikaon, saamaanya rup se shwet rakt koshikaon, kaa asaamaanya bahujnan he
 Leukemia is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of diseases
 anya rup main, yah rudhirvigyaan sambandhi arbud ke naam se gyaat rogon ke samooh kaa bhi ek vyapak hissaa he
 Leukemia is subdivided into various large groups in clinical and pathological terms
 pratham vibhaajan ghaatak or dirghakaalik roopon ke bich main he
 Additionally, diseases are subdivided according to the type of blood cell affected
 yah vibhaajan shwetarktata ko limphoblactic yaa limphosaitic shwetarktata or miloid yaa milogens shwetarktata main vibhajit karata he: By combining these two classifications, there are four main categories: milogens shwetarktata || ghaatak milogens leukemia )||dirghakaalik milogens leukemia ) Within these main classes, there are distinctively different sub-classes
 antat:, royendaar koshika vaali leukemia or tii-cell prolimphosaitic leukemia ko aamtaur par is vargeekaran yojana ke baahar mana jaataa he
 Displacement of normal bone marrow cells by high numbers of immature white blood cells causes significant damage to the bone marrow in the process of blood clot damage from bone marrow damage
 iskaa arth he ki shwetarktata se peedit logon ko aasaani se kharonch aa sakati he, unka atyadhik rakt srav ho saktaa, yaa unhen pin chubhane se bhi rakt srav ho saktaa he
 White blood cells that fight with microbes can be suppressed or made dysfunctional
 yah marij kii pratiraksha pranali ko saadhaaran sankraman se ladane main asamarth kar saktaa he yaa sharir kii anya koshikaon par hamalaa shuru kar saktaa he
 Since leukemia does not normally allow the immune system to degrade, some of its patients often suffer infections
 yah galtundika sankraman, mukh main ghaav yaa dast hone se lekar pranaghatak nimonia or samay-samay par hone vaale sankramanon ke rup main ho saktaa he
 Finally, deficiency of red blood cells leads to anemia, which can cause difficulty breathing and achingness
 kuch rogi anya lakshanon kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 These symptoms may include feeling sick, such as fever, chills, night sweats, and other symptoms of flu or feeling tired
 kuch rogi bade hue yakrut or pleeha ke kaaran michali yaa baaripan kaa anubhav karte hai; iske parinamswaroop vajan main anaichhik kami ho sakati he
 If the cells affected by leukemia attack the central nervous system, then neurological symptoms may occur
 shwetarktata se jude hue sabhi lakshanon kaa kaaran anya bimariyon ko bataaya ja saktaa he
 As a result, treating the symptoms of leukemia can always be treated by medical examination
 shwetarktata kaa shabdic arth 'shwet rakt' hota he, is kaaran is beemaari kaa naam isse jodakar shwetarktata diya gaya he, adhikansh rogiyon main upachaar se pehle kiye gaye jaanch main badi maatr main shwet rakt koshika paayi jaati hai
 a large number of white blood cells are clearly visible when the blood sample is viewed under a microscope
 aksar, ye atirikt shwet rakt koshikaayen aparipakv yaa dushkriyasheel hoti hai
 An excessive number of cells can also disrupt the level of other cells, causing a damaging imbalance in the blood volume
 kuch rogiyon main niyamit rudhir gananaa ke samay shwetarktata ke kuch rogiyon main shwet rakt koshika adhik maatra main dikhaai nahin detii he
 This rare condition is called Alukemia
 asthi majja main ab karkat yukt shwet rakt koshikaayen paayi jaati hai jo rakt koshikaon ke saamaanya nirmaan main baadha daalati hai
 However, leukemia affected cells are found in the marrow instead of being involved in the blood stream, where they appear in blood tests
 aleukemia ke rogi ke liye, rakt pravaah main shwet rakt koshika kii sankhyaayein saamaanya yaa kam ho sakati hai
 Alukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is most commonly found in leukemia, especially in hairy cells
 leukemia ke sabhi vibhinn prakaaron ke koi bhi ek bhi gyaat kaaran nahin hai
 Different leukemia may possibly have different causes
 gyaat kaarnon main prakritik or kritrim ayaanikrut vikiran, insaanon main paae jane vaale vishaanu jaise maanav sambandhi T-limphotropic vishaanu or kuch rasaianik padaarth, vishesh rup se benzene or pichley ghaatak utak-samooh ke liye alkaile samooh sambandhi chemotherapy abhikaarak shaamil hote hai
 Tobacco intake is associated with an increased risk of developing fatal myeloid leukemia in adults
 matra-bhrun sancharan ke kuch maamalon kii soochna mili he
 Leukemia, like other cancer, occurs as a result of physiological mutations of DNA that activate oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes and hinder the control of cell death, differentiation, and division
 ye parivartan swatah ho sakate hai yaa ynikaran vikiran yaa cancerajanit padaarthon ke sampark main aane se ho sakate hai or anuvanshik karkon ke dwaara sambhawatah prabhavit ho sakate hai
 Researchers' group and subject control studies have linked contact with petrochemicals such as benzene and hair dyeing to the development of some forms of leukemia
 virason ko bhi leukemia ke kuch kismon ke saath joda gaya he
 For example, some cases of ALL are related to infection caused by either the human immune deficiency virus or the human T-lymphotropic virus
 haalanki, ek report yah suzav detaa he ki kuch keetanuon ke sampark main aane se bacchon ko leukemia se kuch had tak suraksha mil sakati he
 Some people have a genetic tendency to develop leukemia
 yah pravriti paariwarik itihaason or yugma adhyayanon se prardashit hoti he
 Affected people may comprise one or more genes
 kuch maamalon main, pariwaron main anya sadasyon ke saamaan ek hi prakaar kii leukemia viksit hone kii pravriti hoti hai; anya pariwaron main, prabhavit logon main vibhinn prakaar kii leukemia yaa sambandhit rakt karkat viksit ho saktaa he
 In addition to these genetic themes, people with chromosomal abnormalities or some other genetic conditions have a greater risk of leukemia
 udhaaharan ke liye, janmajaat vikruti se prabhavit logon main ghaatak leukemia ke prakaaron ke viksit hone kaa atyadhik khatra hota he
 Fanconi anemia is at risk of fatal myeloid leukemia
 gaiyr-ynikrut vikiran se leukemia hone ke kaarnon ko sunishchit karne ke liye kai dashakon se adhyayan kiye ja chuke hai
 All data collected by the International Agency for Research on the Cancer Expert Working Group of naturally occurring and static electricity and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy in collaboration with the production, transmission and use of electric power They did a detailed review
 They concluded that there is very limited evidence that higher Leveled ELF magnetic fields can cause childhood leukemia
 mahatvapurn ELF chumbakeey kshetron ke sampark main aane se in ucch staron vaale chumbakeey kshetron ke sampark main aane vaale bacchon main leukemia hone kaa doguna adhik khatra ho saktaa he
 However, the report also suggests that the methodological weaknesses and biases found in these studies likely pose an increased risk of exacerbation
 vayaskon main leukemia ke saath sambandh hone yaa kisi anya rup main ghaatkata hone ke koi pramaan prardashit nahin hue hai
 Since contact with such levels of elfs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that contact with ELF, if subsequently proven to be functional, would only account for 100 to 2400 cases worldwide annually, Will reveal 0

95% of the total incidence of that year
 jab tak leukemia ke kaaran kaa pataa nahin lagaaya jaataa he, is beemaari kii rokthaam karne kaa koi rasta nahin he
 Even after the causes are detected, they cannot be controlled immediately, such as naturally occurring background radiation and therefore they are not particularly helpful in prevention purposes
 leukemia ke adhikansh prakaaron kaa upachaar aushadhiy chikitsa ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Some are also treated with radiation therapy
 kuch maamalon main, asthi majja pratyaropan upyogi hota he
 Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has proven useful in the treatment of leukemia
 ALL kaa prabandhan asthi majja ke niyantran or sarvangi beemaari par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Additionally, the treatment must prevent the cells affected by leukemia from spreading to other parts, especially the central nervous system, such as the groin eyelet
 In general, all these treatments are divided into several stages
 upachaar kaa nirnay rudhir rog visheshgy CLL upachaar ko donon charan or vyaktigat marij ke rog lakshanon par aadhaarit rakhte hai
 a large group of CLL patients have low-grade disease, which does not benefit from treatment
 CLL sambandhit jatiltaaon yaa adhik badi hui beemaari se prabhavit vyaktiyon ko aksar upachaar se laabh pahunchataa he
 In general, the treatment points are as follows: vishisht upachaar paddati CLL shaayad vartmaan upachaar dwaara laailaaj he
 Primarily chemotherapy treatment consists of chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide with combination chemotherapy as well as a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone
 ek corticosteroid ke prayog kaa atirikt laabh he kuch sambandhit swa-pratirakshit bimariyon, jaise ki immunohemolytic anemia yaa immune-mediated thrombosaitopania ko dabaanaa
pratirodhi sthitiyon main, newcliosaid aushadhiyon jaise ki fluderebin, pentostatin, yaa cladribin ekal abhikarta ke dwaara upachaar safal ho sakate hai
 Younger patients may consider genetically different or autologous bone marrow transplantation from their own body
 kai vibhinn karkat pratirodhi aushadhiyaan AML ke upachaar ke liye prabhavakaari hai
 Treatments vary according to the age of the patient and according to the particular subtypes of AML
 samgr rup se, kaaryniti asthi majja se sambandhit or sarvangi beemaari ko rokna, jabaki nihit hone par kendriya tantrika tantra kaa vishisht upachaar karnaa he
 In general, most cancer specialists rely on a combination of drugs for the initial induction phase of chemotherapy
 is tarah ke sammishran vaale chemotherapy aamtaur par asthi majja ke jamaav main jaldi kami laane kaa laabh or beemaari se pratirodh karne main kam jokhim pradaan karte hai
 The purpose of condensation and care in bone marrow is to prevent recurrence of the disease
 asthi majja main ghanibhutikaran ke upachaar ke liye aksar baar-baar chemotherapy die jane ke alawa aushadhiyon ke saath gahan chemotherapy aprihaary hoti he
 Conversely, care-related treatment consists of the dose of drugs used during the induction phase
 CML ke liye anek sambhav upachaar hai, lekin nae rogiyon ke rog lakshan dekhakar uskaa nidaan karne ke liye maanak dekhbhaal imetinib chikitsa he
 Compared to most cancer-resistant drugs, it has relatively few side effects and can be consumed orally at home
 is aushadhi se, 90% se adhik rogi is beemaari ko kam se kam paanch varshon tak niyantrit rakh paaenge, jisase ki CML ek dirghakaalik, niyantraneey sthiti ban sakegaa
 In a more aggravated and uncontrolled state, when the patient cannot tolerate imatinib, or if the patient wishes for a permanent treatment, a genetically different bone marrow transplant may be performed
 is prakriya main ucch khuraaq vaali chemotherapy or vikiran chikitsa ke saath-saath ek anukool daata se asthi majja kaa ant:shira nishek karnaa shaamil hota hai
 About 30% of the patients die in this process
 upachaar kaa nirnay is rog ke lakshan nahin paae jane vaale roendaar koshika vaali leukemia se prabhavit marijon kaa atisheeghra upachaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 Consideration of treatment is generally considered necessary if the patient has signs and symptoms of the disease such as decreased blood cell count, frequent infections, recurrent scratches, anemia, or feeling tired that disrupts the patient's daily life Be enough to do
 vishisht upachaar paddati jin marijon ko upachaar kii jarurat hoti he, unhen aamtaur par pratidin ek saptaah tak yaa to ant:shira nishek yaa twachaa main saamaanya injection ke dwaara twachaa ke bheetar cladribin yaa ant:shira nishek ke dwaara chaar saptaah tak pentostatin diya jaataa he
 In most situations, one round of treatment will provide long-term relief
 anya upachaaron main rituzimeb kaa ant:shira nishech yaa interpheran-alpha kaa swayan injection lenaa he
 In limited conditions, the patient may benefit from the operation of the spleen
 in upachaaron ko vishisht rup se pratham upachaar ke rup main nahin pradaan kiya jaataa he kyonki unki safalataa dar cladribin yaa pentostatin se kam hoti he
 Most patients in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, which is a rare and rapidly spreading leukemia and with an average survival rate of less than a year, require immediate treatment
 tii-cell prolimphosaitic leukemia kaa upachaar karnaa kathin he or yah chemotherapy sambandhi adhikansh uplabdh aushadhiyon ke anukool nahin hota he
 Several different treatments have been attempted with limited success in some patients: purine-analogous, chlorambucil, and various types of blending chemotherapy
 Alemtuzumab, a white blood cell attacker, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options in treatment
 kuch rogi jo safaltaapurvak is upachaar se anukulata prardashit karte hai, unka bhi anukulata ko sudrudh karne ke liye koshika nalee pratyaropan hota he
 Significant research is being done regarding the causes, diagnosis, treatment and diagnosis of leukemia
 saikadon rog-vishyak jaanch kii yojana banaai ja rahi he yaa samay-samay par kii ja rahi he
 The study will focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, while improving patients' lifestyles, or reducing bone marrow coagulation or taking appropriate care after treatment

 He wrote only a single epic called Shishupala Slaughter

 Upma, Arthagaurva and Padalitya - these three qualities are found to be well-known in Magha's diminutive poetry, hence "maghe Santi Trio guna:" is well known about them
 magh ko sanskrit aalochakon va vidwaanon dwaara praayah ek prakand sarvashaastratatvajna vidvan mana jaataa he
 He had scholarship in philosophy, musicology and grammar
 unka panditya ekangi nahi, pratyut sarvagami tha

 The film's producer, director, writer and editor is Hrishikesh Mukherjee
 is film ke mukhya kalakaar rajesh khanna evam amitabh bachchan hai
 The film was awarded in six categories at the Filmfare Awards in addition to the Best Film at the National Film Awards
 film vartmaan se shuru hoti he or cancer ke visheshgy dow bhaskar bannerjee ko saahitiyik puraskaar se sammanit kiya ja rahaa he ki usne anand jaise upanyaas kii rachana kii or dow bhaskar bannerjee apni safaai main yah kahata he ki yah uski diary ke kuch panne hai or vah koi lekhak nahin he or yah upanyaas sahi ghatnaon par aadhaarit he
 Now the film goes back to the past when Bhaskar Banerjee, a militant doctor, is taking care of patients in a Mumbai slum and sees that the hunger and the plight has spread to the extent that he is incapable of doing anything for anyone
 vahiin uske dost dow prakaash kulkarni kaa jamaa jamaaya aspataal he jo bin biimaar marizon ko bhi dekh letaa he or unase acchhee raqam anthta he jabaki garib mariz, jo ki bhaskar bhejtaa hi rahata he, ke vah bina paise hi saare test karvaa detaa he
 One day Prakash comes to know of the threat of one of his gynecologist friend Dr
 Trivedi from Delhi that he is sending his friend Anand to him
 prakaash anand se kuch saal pehle mila tha or uskaa acha dost ban gaya tha
 Anand has intestinal cancer and he knows that at most he will live for six months
 jab prakaash or bhaskar, prakaash ke daphtar main baithe huye hote hai to anand vahaan aa dhamkata he or apni mazaaq kii aadat shuru kar detaa he jisase bhaskar bannerjee ko gussa aa jaataa he or vah anand se poochta he ki use maaloom bhi he ki use kya beemaari he, to anand use bataata he ki use cancer he or vah zyaada se zyaada vah chah maheene hi zindaa rahegaa
 Hearing this, Bhaskar becomes convinced of the joy that despite knowing that he is the pride of a few days, the joy is so lively
 anand ab bhaskar ke ghar rahane lagata he or kisi tarah yah pataa laga letaa he ki bhaskar ek ladki renu se prem karata he lekin is prem ko zaahir karne kii usamen himmat nahin he
 Anand meets Renu's mother with the help of a wrestler and confirms Bhaskar and Renu's relationship but informs Renu's mother that he will not stay in Bhaskar and Renu's wedding
 isi bich anand ko rangamanch main kaam karne vaala ek kalakaar isa bhai suuratavala bhi mil jaataa he or usase anand kuch samvaad sikhkar bhaskar ke tepe recorder main tepe kar letaa he
 Now the feeling of joy falls day by day and one day he lies in bed
 bhaskar koi karishme kii talash main kisi homeopathic doctor ke paas jaataa he or apane peeche prakaash or renu ko anand kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye chhod jaataa he lekin uske lautne tak anand dam tod chukaa hota he or parshv main anand kaa vahi rangamanch se tepe kiya samvaad chal rahaa hota he or yaheen film khatm ho jaati he

 rajbhavan panchmadi bharat ke madhya pradesh rajya ke rajyapal kaa aadhikarik awaas he
 It is located in a city called Panchmarhi in the state
 om prakaash kohli madhya pradesh ke vartmaan rajyapal hai jo 8 sitambar 2016 ko rajyapal niyukt hue the The Sinhalese language is the largest language spoken in Sri Lanka
 sinhalai ke baad srilanka main sabase zyada boli janevaali bhashaa tamil he
 It is usually not the case that the name of a country should be of the caste settled in that country and the same name should also be of the language used by that caste
 sinhal dweep kii yah visheshta he ki usamen basane vaali jati bhi "sinhal" kehalaati chali ai he or us jati dwaara vyavahrut hone vaali bhashaa bhi "sinhal"
 Like the scripts of many Indian languages, the Sinhala language script is also a modified version of the Brahmi script and as Devanagari is the alphabet of all Indian languages, in addition to the Urdu alphabet, Devanagari is also the alphabet of the Sinhala language
 sinhal bhashaa ko do rup maanya hai - shuddh sinhal tathaa mishrit sinhal Only thirty-two letters are valid for Shudh Sinhala- sinhal ke pracheenatam vyakaran granth sidatsangra ) kaa mat he ki ji tathaa i -- a, tathaa aa kii hi maatra vruddhi vaali matraayen hai
 The present mixed Sinhala has not only enriched its alphabet with the letters of the Pali alphabet, but has also adopted all those which were more in the Sanskrit alphabet
 is prakaar vartmaan mishrit sinhal main aksharon kii sankhya chauvan he
 Eighteen letters are considered "swara" and the remaining thirty-six letters are consonants
 do akshar jab milakar ekarup hote hai, to yah prakriya "sandhi" kehalaati he
 Only ten types of treaties are considered in pure Sinhala
 kintu aadhunik sinhal main sanskrit shabdon kii sandhi athwa sandhichchhed sanskrit vyakaranon ke niyamon ke hi anusaar kiya jaataa he
 The group terms of "monosyllabic" or "anaxaksharas", like Sanskrit, are divided into four parts - Namay, Eminent, Prefix and Nipat
 sinhal main hindi kii hi tarah do vachan hote hai - "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan"
 There is no additional "dualism" like Sanskrit
 is "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan" ke bhed ko sankhya bhed kehete hai
 Just as "hindi" and "sinhala" are equated with "vow", similarly we can say that Hindi and pure Sinhala are also synonymous with "gender"
 purush teen hi hai - pratham purush, madhyam purush tathaa uttam purush
 There are eight factors of pronouns used in all three men, which have their own distinctions
 "karm" ke baad praaia: "karan" kaarak kii ginati hoti he, kintu sinhal ke aath karkon main "karm" tathaa "karan" ke bich main "kartri" kaarak kii ginati kii jaati he
 The number of factors remains at eight, despite the "dominant" factor not being the "address" factor
 vaakya kaa mukhyansh "kriya" ko hi maanate hai, kyonki kriya ke abhaav main koi bhi kathan banataa hi nahin he
 Thus Sinhala grammar is mostly a copy of Sanskrit
 to bhi usamen na to sanskrit kii tarah "parasmapad" tathaa "aatmanepad" hote hai or na lat lot aadi das lakaar
 These eight types of verbs are considered in Sinhala - sinhal bhashaa bolne-chaalane ke samay hamaari bhojpuri aadi boliyon kii tarah pratyayon kii drushti se bahut hi aasaan he, kintu likhane-padhane main utani hi duruh
 In speech and speech, i go through the verb only, xxwrep 5 go, etc
 i will not go, go, go etc
 becomes the work of all verbs
 lingabhed hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye tedi kheer mana jaataa he
 Sinhala language is very simple from this point of view
 vahaan "acha" shabd ke samanaarthi "hond" shabd kaa prayog aap "ladkaa" tathaa "ladki" donon ke liye kar sakate hai
 The idioms of each language are its own
 duusari bhashaaon main unke thik-thik paryaay khojna bekaar he
 Nevertheless, due to experience equivalence, similar sayings are available in two different languages spoken by two different castes
 sinhal tathaa hindi ke kuch muhaavaron tathaa kahawaton main paryaapt ekarupata he
 The Sinhala language, which is similar to more than one language of North India, has developed from the language of those inscriptions which BC
 Available continuously since the second third century
 bhagwaan buddha ke parinirvana ke do sau varsh baad ashokaputra mahendra sinhal dweep pahunche, to "mahavansh" ke anusaar unhone sinhal dweep ke logon ko dweep bhashaa main hi upadesh diya tha
 The tradition that Mahamati Mahendra brought with him was "oral"
 vah parampara yaa to buddha ke samay kii "magadhi" rahi hogi, yaa unke do sau varsh baad kii koi aisi "praakrit" jise mahendra sthavir swayan bolte rahe honge
 Sinhala history holds that Mahendra Sthavir brought with him not only the tradition of Tripitaka, but also the traditions of his languages or his stories
 un atthakathaon kaa baad main sinhal anuwaad hua

 dow jain ne pachchis pratishat kamishan par unki apni likhi hui pustaken bechney kaa kaam de diya
 Later Madanlal got a job in a firecracker factory where he learned the method of making hand grenades while working

 On 5 January 1948, at a meeting in Ahmednagar, arrests were issued on 12 January 1948 on the report of Police Inspector Razzaq in the name of Congress leader Rao Rasaheb Patwardhan, on charges of snatching mikes from his hands
 lekin tab tak ve donon ahmednagar chhodkar dilli ja chuke the
 On 20 January 1948 Madanlal Pahwa reached Birla House, New Delhi, sitting in a lorry with Vishnu Ramakrishna Karkare, Shankar Kishtaiya, Digambar Ramchandra Budge, Gopal Godse, Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte, headed by Surjit Singh
 birla house ke getkiper choturam ko rishbat dekar ye sabhi log prarthana sabha main ghus gayi
 Madanlal asked Chhoturam to let him go to the back of the meeting place, from where a photograph of the people attending Gandhi's prayer meeting could be taken
 choturam ko jab madanlaal par shaq hua to usne vahaan se chale jane ko kaha
 At this, Madanlal returned and threw grenades from the top of the boundary wall to Gandhiji's assembly and ran away from there, but the crowds of the crowd climbed
 unke anya saathi prarthana sabha main machi afra-tafari kaa laabh uthaakar birla house se saaf batch nikle
 When the trial of Gandhian slaughter took place in the court, Madanlal admitted in it that whoever was involved in this conspiracy, according to the earlier plan, had to act only by throwing bombs and to spread the mess in the assembly, the rest was the responsibility of others
 jab use choturam ne jane se roka to usne jaise bhi usase ban paaya apana kaam kar diya
 The plan for that day may have failed, but the government had already known that anyone could kill Gandhi at any time, then who should have been concerned about their safety

 The film stars Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah in the lead
 ye krish shrunkhlaa kaa doosraa film he, or koi mil gaya kaa doosraa kadi he
 Its story revolves around Krishna, who has some powers from his father, Rohit Mehra
 rohit or nisha mehara kaa paanch saal kaa betaa krishna mehara se aicu test main kuch sawaal puchhne par uske shikshak ko lagata he ki krishna ke paas kuch asaadhaaran buddhi he
 When he tells this to his grandmother Sonia, he is afraid that the way he lost his son due to these powers, that he should not lose his grandson as well, so that he can give these grandchildren's powers to the world
 She goes to a village in a remote mountain to hide from
 kai saalon ke baad kuch log us gaanv main camp ke liye aate hai, isi dauraan priya glyder se girti rahati he, or krishna use bachaa letaa he, or is tarah pehali baar krishna kii mulaaqaat priya se hoti he
 Krishna falls in love with Priya, and at the same time Priya is very surprised to see Krishna climbing the mountain so easily
 jab priya apane ghar, singapore jaati he, to uski bos use or uski dost ko paanch din kaa bin-bataae chuttee lene ke liye naukari se nikaal detii he
 Then her friend, Honey, says that they were working during these five days and she tells her boss about Krishna and plans to show him about him on TV
 priya ko pataa hota he ki krishna usase pyaar karata he or use singapore main laane ke liye wo jhooth bol detii he ki use usase pyaar he or kahati he ki use singapore aa kar, usase shaadi karne ke liye uski maan se ijajad leni padegi
 Krishna's grandmother refuses, saying that people want to take advantage of her powers
 wo use bataati he ki uske pita rohit ko doctor siddhanth aryaa ek aise computer banane bolta he, jo bhavishya dekh sake, jisase ladaai ko roka ja sake, par baad main rohit ko pataa chalata he ki uskaa makasad acha karnaa nahin he, is kaaran wo mashin ko tod detaa he
 It is later revealed that Rohit died in the laboratory
 is khabar se duhkhi nisha kii bhi kuch dinon baad maut ho jaati he
 After knowing all this, Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers
 uski daadi use singapore jane kii ijaajat de detii he
 In Singapore, Priya and Honey do a lot of work for him, but Krishna is unable to do anything special, which frustrates both of them and gets fired again

 Meanwhile, Priya gets to know that Krishna is Krishna by watching his camera video
 wo or hani ise tivi par dikhaa kar krishna ko sitara banane kii sochate hai
 After that the conversation goes on between Priya and Honey that if Priya does not fall in love with him, Krishna would never come here, and Krishna listens to all this and goes away
 par priya uske baad hani se kahati he ki use sach main krishna se pyaar ho gaya he
 Krishna thinks of going to his house and then Priya comes there, and then Priya realizes her mistake that Krishna deliberately wants to hide his identity
 or wo bos ko krish kii pahchaan duniya ko dikhaane se rokane kii koshish karti he
 Vikram Sinha has been searching for Krishna for many years
 jab krishna, priya se naaraaz ho kar hawaii adde par aata he, tabhi uski mulaaqaat vikram se hoti he or wo use bataata he ki uske pita, rohit mehara abhi bhi jivit hai or doctor siddhanth use bhavishya dekhne vaale mashin ke banane tak jivit rakhega
 After that he will use that machine in his evil deeds
 isi dauraan siddhanth kai saalon ke baad us mashin ko phir se banane main safal ho jaataa he
 When he uses her for the first time, he sees his future that Krish is about to kill him
 siddhanth is kaaran cristan ko maar detaa he, kyonki use lagata he ki wo krish he
 Krishna comes to her island to rescue her father from him
 waapas aakar jab siddhanth apana bhavishya phir se dekhtaa he to use phir se vahi cheez dikhaai detaa he
 He is stunned to see Krish alive in his island with CCTV
 krish jab andar aata he to kai saare gunde us par hamalaa karte hai, par wo sabhi ko haraa detaa he, tabhi vikram ke sir par siddhanth goli maar detaa he or dikhaata he ki priya or rohit uske kabje main hai
 Krish starts killing him and shortly before he dies, he asks Krish who he is
 krish apana mask nikaalata he or uske baad siddhanth kii maut ho jaati he
 He tells Rohit that he is his son and all three return to India
 rohit apane pita ke puraane computor kaa jaadu se baat karne ke liye istemaal karata he or bahut dur ek antariksh yaan dikhaai detaa he

 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth
 jawaharlal teen bacchon main se sabase bade the, jinamein baaki do ladkiyaan thi
 The elder sister, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly
 sabase choti bahan, krishna hathising, ek ullekhneey lekhika bani or unhone apane parivaar-janon se sambandhit kai pustaken likhin
 Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in some of the best schools and universities in the world
 unhone apni schuli shiksha hero se or college kii shiksha trinity college, cambridge se puri kii thi
 He then completed his law degree from Cambridge University
 england main unhone saat saal vyateet kiye jisamen vahaan ke fabian samaajwaad or irish rashtrawaad ke liye ek tarksangat drushtikon viksit kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer
 raajnneetik kshetra main lokmaanya tilak ke baad jam kar likhane vaale netaaon main ve alag se pahachaane jate hai
 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both
 nehru ji swabhaav se hi swadhyaayi the
 He studied great texts
 sabhi rajnatik uttejnaaon ke baavjood ve swadhyay ke liye roj hi samay nikaal liya karte the
 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he
 The solution to the extreme lack of time for writing in the busiest struggling days of political life was to make the long dull days of jail a creative one
 isliye unki adhikansh pustaken jail main hi likhi gayi hai
 In his writings, a mixed form of the spirit of a litterateur and the searching heart of a historian has emerged
 indira gandhi ko kaalpanik patr likhane ke bahaane unhone vishwa itihaas kaa adhyay-dar-adhyay likh daalaa
 These letters were never actually sent, but by this, a simple communicative and well-written text like a glimpse of world history was easily prepared
 bharat kii khoj ne lokapriyata ke alag pratimaan rache hai, jis par aadhaarit bharat ek khoj naam se ek uttam dharawahik kaa nirmaan bhi hua he
 His autobiography About my story, the well-known Manishi Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan believes that his autobiography, which narrates the story of his life and struggle without trying to prove self-pity or moral superiority, is one of the most notable books of our era
 Is one of in pustakon ke atirikt nehru ji ne aganit vyaakhyaan diye, lekh likhe tathaa patr likhe
 For their publication, 'jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund' decided to publish a bibliography

 According to the census of India, this village is located in Tehsil Sambhal, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh

 In which weeds alone cause 37 percent loss while insects cause 22 percent and diseases 29 percent

 Kharif crops have played a very important role in strengthening Indian agriculture and the economy of the country
 pichley kuch varshon ke aankadon ke aadhaar par ye fasalein ausatan 72
6 million hactor bhoomi par ugaayi ja rahi hai or lagbhag 105
9 million ton khadyannon kaa utpaadan 95
7 million ton he
 If one looks at the productivity of the crops of the two seasons, there is a considerable difference
 kharif fasalon kii utpaadakta 1458 ki
gra
 / hactor he jo ki desh kii rabi fasalon kii utpaadakta se kaaphi peeche he
 Important crops in Kharif crops are paddy, maize, millet, groundnut, sesame, pigeonpea and soyabean etc
 in fasalon main dhan mukhya khaadya fasal he jo ki puure desh main ugaai jatihai or vishwa bhar main isaki agrani khapat he
 Among the crops grown in the Kharif season, paddy is the main food crop that is grown all over the country and is the leading consumption worldwide
 There are several reasons for the decrease in productivity in crops grown during the Kharif season
 is mausam main sinchai kii kami tathaa kabhi pani kii adhikta kaa fasalon par bura prabhaav padataa he
 Apart from this, excessive dryness in the weather and frequent fluctuations in temperature invite weeds, insects and diseases
 jiske kaaran fasalon ko surakshit rakhana kisaan ke liye bahut badi jimmedaari ho jaati he
 Mainly three types of weeds are found in Kharif crops: ghaas varg ke kharpatvaaron kii pattiyaan patali or lambii hoti hai tathaa in pattiyon ke andar samanaantar dhaariyaan pai jaati he
 These are algebraic plants such as savannah, kodon makara, doob, vanachari, guinea grass
 is prakaar ke kharpatvaaron kii pattiyaan praaia: chaudee hoti he tathaa ye adhiktar do beej patreey paudhe hote hai- saathi, kanakwa, kondara, bhangad, contili chaulaai, makoy, badi dudhi hajaar dana, jal bhangra, punarnava or gaajar ghaas 
 The leaves of the weeds of this group are long and solid with trunk edges
 jadon main ganthen paayi jaati hai jo jadon main bhojan ko ikattha karke naye paudhon ko janm dene main sahaayta karte hai jaise mauthaa Kharif crops cause more damage due to weed infestation than Rabi season crops
 saamanyat: kharpatvaar fasalon ko praapt hone vaali 47 pratishat nitrogen, 42 pratishat phosphorus, 50 pratishat potash, 39 pratishat calcium or 24 pratishat magnesium tak kaa upyog kar lete hai
 Along with this, weeds also harm crops by giving shelter to diseases and pests that are harmful to crops
 iske alaava kuch jahrile kharpatvaar jaise gaajar ghaas, datura, gokharu, kantedaar chaulaai aadi na keval farm utpaada kii gunvattta ko ghataate hai balki manushya or pashuon ke swasthya ke prati khatra utpann karte hai
 The extent of damage caused by weeds to the crop depends on the crop, the season and the type of weeds and their number, so not all crops have the same damage due to the presence of weeds
 kab karen kharpatvaar niyantran The extent of damage caused by an outbreak of weeds depends on many things
 fasalon main kisi bhi avasthaa main kharpatvaar niyantran karnaa samaan rup se aarthik drushti se laabhakaari nahin hota he
 Therefore, the period of maximum loss due to presence of weeds has been prescribed for each crop
 is avasthaa / avadhi ko kranthik avasthaa kehete hai
 Farmers can control weeds in their crops using various methods like traction, mechanics, chemicals and biological methods etc
 lekin paaramparik vidhiyon ke dwaara kharpatvaaron kaa niyantran karne par laagat tathaa samay adhik lagata he
 Hence weeds are controlled quickly and effectively by chemicals and this method is also economically beneficial
 lekin shodh kaaryon dwaara pramanit kuch nimnlikhit sasy kriyaayein bhi kharpatvaaron ke prakope ko kam karne main laabhadaayak pai gai hai
 Under this technique, transparent polythalin sheets of different thickness were spread over the upper surface of the soil moist soil for 4-6 weeks in the month of May before the sowing of the soil, the upper surface temperature of the soil from 8-120 as compared to the external temperature
 Much is done
 isse mitti kii upari sataha main jamaa kharpatvaaron kii bijon ke ankuran hone kii shakti kam yaa niskriy ho jaati he
 Apart from this, some harmful insects, nematodes and other pesticides are also destroyed
 yah takanic paudhashala main paudh taiyaar karte samay kharpatvaaron ko niyantrit karne main bahut hi prabhaavshaalee hai
 In this technique, fertilizer and seeds are added to the field only by special machines for sowing
 usase pehle khet main koi kriya nahin kii jaati he
 This technique is used in wheat crop
 is takanic se kisaanon ko lagbhag 2500 rupaye prati hactor kam laagat aati he or isse gulli danda naamak kharpatvaar kii sankhya kam hoti he
 Weeds can be controlled easily by choosing a single chemical according to the crop by taking detailed information on the herbicide / chemicals used in the main crops of the Kharif season

 ● mishrit fasalon main rasayanon kaa chayan fasalon ke mutabik hi karen
 ● Do not use weedicide by mixing sand, manure and soil

 while using herbicides
