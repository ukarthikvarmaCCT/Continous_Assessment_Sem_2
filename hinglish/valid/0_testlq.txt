 Bismil's nature was that he either did not take any work in hand and once he took the task in hand, he would not leave it without completing it

 When Bismil argued against the verdict in fluent English in front of the Chief Court, then the public prosecutor Jagatnarayan Mulla ji looked at the armpits
 is par chif justise louis sharts ko bismil se angreji main yah poochna padaa - "mistar ramprasad ! from bhich univarsity you haev teken da degree of laa ?" is par bismil ne hans kar chif justise ko uttar diya tha - "excuj me sar ! e king mekar dajant rikhwire eni degree

" palat dete hai ham mauje-hawadis apni jurrat se; ki hamane aandhiyon main bhi chiraag aksar jalaaye hai
 "he meant to say clearly that he is not a servant, but Mulla ji who gets salary from the government

 At the same time it is also requested that they have the power to reverse the waves of the sea with their audacity; What is the case for reversing the case? Who dared after speaking so much that would have stayed ahead of them

 They quietly slipped through the back door
 phir us din unhone koi jirah kii hi nahin
 Bismil was such a present! bismil dwaara kii gayi safai kii bahes se sarkari tabake main sansani fail gayi
 Mulla ji refused to plead as a government lawyer
 atev adaalat ne bismil kii 18 july 1927 ko di gayi swayan vakaalat karne kii arji khaarij kar di
 He then presented a 76-page argumentative written debate, on which the judges expressed doubt that Bismil had written it by some jurist rather than himself
 antatogatva unheen lakshmishankar mishra ko bahes karne kii ijaajat di gayi jinhen lene se bismil ne manaa kar diya tha
 This was also done by the court and government lawyer Jagatnarayana Mulla
 kyonki agar bismil ko puraa mukadmaa khud ladne kii chhot di jaati to sarkaar nishchit rup se mukadmaa haar jaati
 According to the judgment which was given on 22 August 1927, Ram Prasad Bismil, Rajendranath Lahiri and Ashfaq Ulla Khan were sentenced to life imprisonment under IPC 121 and 120 and according to 302 and 396, in the first two cases of hanging and Thakur Roshan Singh 5 + 5 a total of 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and the execution was ordered according to the next two occasions

 After this, a delegation of five persons led by Madan Mohan Malaviya went to Shimla and met the Viceroy again and prayed that as these four accused have given a written undertaking to the government that in future They will not participate in the activity and they have expressed remorse on their actions, so the decision of the High Court can be reconsidered
 But the Viceroy refused them outright

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture
 vaise bhi bhartiya jalwaayu or pashu-pakshiyon ke shabdon ke liye unani, latin, german or anya hind-europea bhashaaon main milte julate shabd nahin milte, jaise mor, murga, baagh, hathi, aam, kelaa, pipal, bargad, neem, garm-mausam, ganda, bhens, chaaval, ityadi

 Lev Trotsky was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist of Russia, a Soviet politician and the founder and first leader of the Red Army
 roosi kranti ke baad hue bheeshan grih yuddh main vijayi rahi laal sena kii kaman trotski ke haath main hi thi
 As a theorist, he contributed to Marxist discourse through the theory of permanent revolution
 iske saath hi trotski ne ek niyam kaa pratipaadan bhi kiya ki poonjeewaad ke vikaas kaa str sabhi jagah ek sa nahin hota jiskaa parinaam pichde deshon main saamaajik or aitihaasik vikaas ke do charnon ke ek saath ghatit ho jane main nikalataa he
 This theoretical achievement of Trotsky in the first decade of the twentieth century amid the ongoing debate among Marxists reinforced the logic of revolutionizing an industrially backward country like Russia
 lenin ke dehanth ke baad trotski ne stallin dwaara pravartit ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant kaa virodh kiya, lekin ve party ke bheetar hone vaale sangharsh main akele padate chale gayi
 He was first expelled from the party, and then deported for conspiring against the Soviet state
 nishkasana ke dauraan trotski ne stallin ke netritv main ban rahe soviet sangh kii kadi aalochana karte hue use naukarshah, nirankush or rajkeey poonjeewaadi rajya kii sangya di
 Wandering around the world to escape the Soviet secret police, Trotsky composed classic texts such as 'permanent Revolution', 'revolution Bitred' and 'the History of Russian Revolution' in three volumes
 vishwa-kranti ke apane sapane ko dharti par utaarne ke liye unhone chauthe communist international kii sthapana bhi kii jise koi khaas kamyaabi nahin mili
 During the expulsion, he lost his life at the hands of a Stalin agent in Mexico
 trotski ke anuyaayiyon ne duniya ke kai deshon main choti- choti communist partiyaan bana rakhi hai
 His ideas have been labeled Trotskyism as an alternative to Soviet-style communism
 trotski kaa asli naam lev davidovich bronstin tha
 At an early age he was attracted to Marxism and while doing underground politics adopted the secret name of 'trotsky'
 unke jivan ko teen bhaagon main baant kar dekha ja saktaa he
 The first part is when, like an independent sign of Russian Marxism, he came close to Lenin while participating in the revolutionary movement and then refused to support him
 doosraa hissaa 1917 se shuru ho kar 1923 tak chalaa jab unhone lenin ke saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar soviet kranti ko agrgati pradaan kii
 After this, the third phase of his life began when he waged a campaign against Stalinism to defend the benefits of the revolution
 bolshevik netaaon main keval trotski hi aise the jinhen lenin kaa pramukh saathi hone ke baavjood unke anuyaayi ke taur par nahin dekha jaataa tha
 In 1903, when the Russian Social People's Labor Party split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Trotsky did not support Lenin
 shuruyaat main unhone bolshavism kii yah kah kar ninda kii ki yah to sarvhaara kii nahin balki sarvhaara par taanaashaahee kaa formula he
 At that time he suspected that there were conspiratorial leaders like Lenin Robespierre because of which Russia's socialist movement would be misguided
 us samay trotski kaa vichaar tha ki gupt raajnneetik kaam karne vaali peshewar krantikariyon kii anushaasit party ke haath main kranti kii kaman dene se samaajwaad kaa lakshya nahin hasil kiya ja saktaa
 He was in favor of forming a party of a more democratic and open character
 1905 main ve saint petersburg kii soviet netaa ke rup main ubhare
 This first Soviet of Russia played a major role in the 1905 revolution, and Trotsky considered it a model of authentic democracy
 kranti vifal ho jane ke baad zaarshahi ne unhen giraftaar karke siberia bhej diya
 Trotsky escaped and spent the next decade in Europe
 is dauraan santhnik rup se ve menshavikon ke saath rahe
 When he returned to Russia in 1917, the Zarashahi had collapsed due to the February revolution
 ab ve bolshevikon ke saath aa gayi kyonki unhen laga ki unke or lenin ke vichaaron main kaaphi samanta aa chuki he
 Lenin himself was an admirer of Trotsky's political and theoretical abilities
 bolshevik party main trotski kaa kad teji se badha
 He participated in peace talks with the Germans as the commissioner of foreign affairs
 faujee kamisar ke rup main trotski ne laal sena ke gathan main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai or grih yuddh main uskaa shandaar netritv kiya
 These successes led to Trotsky being viewed as one of Lenin's possible successors
 lenin kii hi tarah trotski ko roosi sarvhaara varg kii rachanaatmak kshamtaaon main gaharaa vishwaas tha
 Based on this belief, he had a special kind of theoretical understanding that came out of the study of world capitalism
 trrotski kaa vichaar tha ki apane pichhadepan se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye kisi desh ko un charnon se kramvaar guzarane kii jarurat nahin hoti jinase viksit desh guzar chuke hote hai
 Symptoms of backwardness emerge along with backwardness in these countries
 is siddhanth ke aadhaar par vishleshan karte hue trotski ne dikhaaya ki rus kaa adhikansh bhaag pichhadaa or aviksit he lekin usamen pashchimi prabhaavon ne bhi ghuspaith kar lee he
 Developed methods of economic production and relations are being adopted in many places
 audyogic vikaas ke in mukaamon ne shahari kendron main ek acha-khaasaa sarvhaara varg or ek pashchimikrut bauddhik abhijan paidaa kar diya he
 As a result, radical forms of political resistance and activism have become prevalent
 chunki udyogikaran upar se thopa gaya he isliye sthaneey poonjipati varg kamjor he, lekin sarvhaara varg majboot he
 The capitalist class is afraid of carrying out a democratic revolution and is unable to fulfill its historical obligation due to its inability, hence this responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat
 kisaanon ko apane netritv main lete hue unke saath morcha bana kar majdoor varg ko samantshahi or uske sabhi avasheshon kaa unmoolan karte hue samaajwaad kii taraf badhanaa hoga
 Trotsky called his theory a permanent revolution
 1850 main marks communist lig kii general concil ko sambodhit karte hue is pad kaa istemaal kar chuke the
 According to Trotsky, farmers with a pre-capitalist mindset will not be able to support the workers in this revolutionary process for very long
 unki dilchaspee jameen kaa malikana mil jane tak hi rahegi
 a front made with farmers that paves the way for revolution will prove to be a hindrance in the creation of socialism
 isliye ek desh main, visheshtah rus main, samaajwaad kaa nirmaan tab tak safal nahin ho saktaa jab tak anya deshon main bhi kranti nahin ho jaati
 Therefore, the Russian Revolution should be seen as the initial phase of the world revolution, especially in developed countries
 dilachasp baat yah he ki trotski kii in baton or pratham vishwayuddh ke baad lenin dwaara pratipaadit kai siddhanton main kaafii samanta prathit hoti he
 Some Trotskyists have also alleged that Trotsky's principles were used by Lenin in the 1917 revolution
 yah alag baat he ki khud trotski ne 1917 main lenin kaa netritv sweekaar karne ke baad kabhi aisa nahin kaha
 After Lenin's death, Stalin wrote a paper about the construction of socialism in a country
 is maamle main bukharin jaise siddhantkaar bhi stallin ke saath the
 But Trotsky warned that the implementation of this principle would have disastrous consequences for Russia
 unhone kaha ki kheti ke samuhikeekaran kaa samay abhi nahin aayaa he
 Trotsky was also against limiting the comintern established by Lenin to the tools of Soviet foreign policy
 unka tark tha ki soviet sangh ko udyogikaran or aadhunikeekaran ke raste par jarur chalanaa chahie, par in uplabdhiyon ko samaajwaad kaa paryaay nahin samajha ja saktaa
 Socialism means higher productivity of labor, consequently better standard of living and society like the most developed forms of its capitalism
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he ki jab sarvhaara ke haath main vishwa-arthvyavastha kii bagdor ho
 Trotsky maintained that the Soviet system under Stalin should only be considered transitional
 abhi is baat kii guarantee nahin kii ja sakati ki iskaa vikaas samaajwaad main hoga yaa yah patit ho kar poonjeewaad ke kisi sanskaran main badal jaaegi
 Trotsky believed that the bureaucracy of Russia was taking the form of a new class
 bhale hi soviet samaaj rajkeey poonjeewaad kii sthiti main na pahunchaa ho, lekin uski sthiti mazdooron ke ek kamatar rajya jaisi to he hi
 The special feature of Trotsky's ideas was that he was opposed to the tendencies of seeing Marxism as the infallible medicine of every problem
 isi tarah ve marxvad ke naam par kala-sahitya or gyaan ke vibhinn kshetron ko ek vishesh disha main dhakele jane ke bhi khilaaf the
 Despite his radical views, he could not do a majority of the party in his favor
 party ke bheetar unhen ek aise netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa tha jo sankat aane par to karishmai netritv pradaan kar saktaa he, lekin party ke bheetar hone vaali rosemara kii uthaa-patake se nibatane main dilchaspee nahin rakhata, or jo apni bauddhik chamak-damak main akelaa rahanaa pasand karata he
 When there was no revolution in Europe as Trotsky had hoped, he blamed the Stalinian project of abandoning the goal of world revolution and trying to build socialism in only one country
 trotski ne yah kabhi nahin mana ki stalinkaaleen galatiyon kii jad main party or raajnneeti kaa leninist-bolshevik vichaar he jiske kaaran ek party dwaara sanchalit rajya puure samaaj ko apana taabedaar banane main kaamyaab ho gaya he
 Indeed, Trotsky never reiterated his harsh criticisms of Lenin and Bolshevism from 1903 to 1914, even though he suffered expulsion in the third period of life

 prakaash jha ne jab ajay devgan or kaajol ko lekar film:dil kya kare banaai, tabhi se unako apni film ke liye ek sthaayee nayak mila
 Gangajal and his experiences of kidnapping were very good with Ajay Devgan and perhaps that is why he is also an important part of the politics film
 film ke saath diggaj nirdeshak ke rup main prakaash jha kaa naam judaa hona hi badi baat nahin balki film kii puri charitra-suchi par drushtipaat karnaa film ke bare main anumaan lagane ke liye aavashyak he

 The film depicts the Mahabharata created by a political party and family's mutual foot

 There are complexities of relationships and interrelationships in the Mahabharata

 raajnneeti ke pradarshan ke is vaataavaran main ek baar phir raajnneetik cinema tathaa raajnneetik yatharth ko lekar vivaad shuru ho gayi
 Controversy also has its place in cinema, often made on political topics

 Prakash Jha had to face adversity even before the performance of his previous film
 ab ve swayan raajnneeti kaa hissaa hai, chunaav ladate hai or aage bhi ladenge
 Amidst all this, the making of a politics film is an important event in itself
 taaja vivaad ye he ki bharat kii rashtriya partiyon main se ek bhartiya rashtriya congress yah chaahati thi ki film ke kuch drishy hataae jaaen

 The Congress is also not liking the scenes of Pranay incident filmed between Katrina Kaif and Arjun Rampal
 ise bhi hataane kii maang uth rahi he
 Earlier, when Katrina Kaif was announced in the film, there was a lot of controversy on this
 us samay charchaa hui thi ki prakaash jha sonia gandhi par film bananaa chaah rahe hai or iske peeche tark diya gaya tha ki sonia gandhi kii tarah katrina caff kii bhi hindi kaaphi kamjor he
 Anyway, when filming started in Bhopal, Katrina Kaif adopted sari and makeup like Sonia
 haalanki is film ke nirmaataa prakaash jha shuru se in baton kaa khandan karte aa rahe hai

 The navel is a deep scar on the abdomen, which causes the umbilical cord to separate from the newborn
 sabhi aparaa sambandhi stanpaayiyon main naabhi hoti he
 This is quite evident in humans

 Since the navel is just a scar and is not defined by genetics in any way, they can be used to identify between identical looking twins in the absence of any other identification mark
 naabhi, pet par ek mahatvapurn nishaan hoti he kyonki uski sthiti insaanon main apekshaakrit samaan hoti he
 The skin around the waist at the level of the navel is supplied by the vein of the tenth thoracic spine
 Consistent with the junction between L3 and L4 vertebrae, the navel usually resides at a vertical level, with a common variation between those between L3 and L5 vertebrae
 ek ubhari hui naabhi kaa kaaran hoti he naal yaa hernia se bachi atirikt twachaa, haalanki ye jaruri nahin he ki naal hernia vaale ek bachche main ubhaar viksit hoga
 At the same time, the crater appearing on the stomach of the person and the layer of abdominal muscle below it also creates a concavity; Thinness at this point contributes to a relative structural weakness, making it susceptible to hernia
 garbhavastha ke dauraan, garbhashay, garbhvatee mahila kii naabhi ko baahar kii ore dhakelta he
 It usually shrinks after birth
 naabhi kaa upyog pet ko chaar bhaagon main baantne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 In Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, the navel falls at the center of the circle of the spread-eagle figure, his famous figure on human proportions

 The navel is sometimes taken advantage of in fashion, through clothing that keeps parts of the lower abdomen open, a use that is more common in women than men
 nagn naabhi ko pradarshit karnaa kuch pashchimi samskritiyon main nishedh tha: udhaaharan ke liye, 1960 ke dashak main, barbara eden ko tivi sho ai dream of jini main apni naabhi kaa khulaa pradarshan karne kii anumati nahin di gayi
 It is now generally accepted in Western culture

 Indian women, and especially women from southern India, traditionally wore saris that left their mid-section and navel open

 However, these women cover their heads with a 'chador' and cover their faces in front of strangers, indicating the belief that keeping the navel open in India is a symbolic, almost mystical relationship with life and life
 And this performance emphasizes the centrality of nature in the role of adulation
 pashchimi samaaj main naabhi pradarshan kii sweekruti ke saath-saath, naabhi chedna bhi yuva mahilaon ke bich aam hota ja rahaa he
 Short dresses that display the navel may also be worn to display the tattoo of the abdomen / navel

 "and God became impregnated

 At that time, both water and lotus were stirred by the Holocaust air

 Then fourteen worlds were created from the lotus in the sky

 " or sanakaadi muni vahaan se chal pade
 They go where the hymn of God is

 The younger they look, the more Vidyakanj are

 Like all the deities, Sanakadi Rishi was also a deity, such as cynicism, sunanda curse, eternal respect and Santkumar was the god of penance
 chaaro ke paas bhi vaahan the jaise- sanak kaa vaahan chil, sanandan kaa vaahan giddh, sanathan kaa vaahan bulbul tathaa sanatkumar kaa vaahan chidiya thi
 At one time all four Sunkadi Kumar reached Vaikunth to see Lord Vishnu

 As soon as the four sages climbed the six deities and climbed the seventh deodor, they saw two great gatekeepers, Jai and Vijay

 Although they were not preventable, the Sunkadi monks who were always calm got angry with the Bhagavad desire

 Didn't your odd nature end despite being a resident of Vaikunth? You people are like snakes

 Sri Bhagavan says "O Brahman! Brahmins are always adorable to me
 main aapse mere dwarapalon dwaara anuchit vyavhaar hetu kshamaa praarthi hoon
 "he told the gatekeepers" Although i can end this curse, but i will not do it because you people have received this curse on my own wish

 sattar ke dashak ke ant main or assi ke dashak main usne king ke bare main jabardast chaanbin kii, lekin use log ke bare main paryaapt jaankaree nahin mili
 Eventually, Seidler contacted Doctor Valentine Logue who agreed to talk about his father
 usne rani maa kii ijaajat se unhen uplabdh pustikaayen deni chaahin
 The queen told him that he would never do this in his lifetime and Seidler stopped his project
 2002 main, rani maa kii mrityu ho gayi
 Three years later, Seidler succumbed to cancer, returning to his creative work for which his illness had inspired him
 unke anusandhan ke dauraan unki mulaaqaat ek ankal se hua, jinka ilaaj log ne kiya tha, unase usne yah janaa ki log is sthiti ke kaarnon ke jaanch ke saath shwasan vyaayaam pranali kaa bhi upyog karte the
 With this type of preparation Seidler envisioned his session
 unhone puri patakatha ko apni patni ko dikhaaya
 His wife liked it, but said it sounded "very different from the technique of cinema", suggesting that they rewrite it as a stage play, so that the relationship between King and George was essential
 To be focused
 jab unhone ise puraa kar liya, unhone kuch logon ko ise bheja or iske bare main un logon kii pratikraya praapt kii
 In early 2006, one of the people Seidler sent his play sent it to Joan Lane of the Wild theme
 wild theme landan main ek production company he
 Lane felt it was also a play with a potential screen drama and he showed it to Simon Egan of Bedlem Productions, who recorded the first textual exercises
 len or bedlem ne milakar plisance theatre main iske pathan kii vyavastha kii, yah australian pravaasiyon ke samooh ke liye uttari bharat main ek chota sa house he
 That's when Tom Hooper's mother immediately called her son and said, "i've found the next project for you
" " manch par iskaa drishy dekhne ke baad, wild theme ne is patakatha ko jeophri rash ko bheja, tabhi chotii ke film nirdeshak tom hupar ne bhavi patakatha kii taiyaari kar lee; or bedlem production ne si-sa film main lain canning ko yah patakatha bhej di, jise laga ki isamen feechar film banaaye jane kii kshamta he
 Hooper loved the story, but thought the original ending needed to be changed, "if you listen to the actual speech, he's clearly struggling with his stuttering problem
" lekin yah ek purna pradarshan nahin he
 He is doing so in some way
 " In June 2009, the UK film Council gave the production a £ 1 million award

 In the opening scene, the scene was set for the closing ceremony of the British Empire exhibition at the 1925 Wembley Stadium in the location of Island Road, Home of Leeds United and Oddsley Stadium, Home of Bradford Bulls
 iland road kaa upyog vahaan kiya gaya jahaan hakalane vaala prince apana saarvajanik bhaashan dene ke liye chal kar jaataa he or odsal stadium ko isliye chunaa gaya tha kyonki yah 1925 ke wemble stadium se miltaa julata tha
 The team could use the stadium only at 10 pm after a football game, at which time the dummies were dressed in periodic costumes and filled on the terraces

 hupar ne rajasi paridrishy utpann karne ke liye kai cinemai takneekon kaa upyog kiya
 The New York Times chief film critic, Manohala Durges, wrote that an attempt has been made to show King's head using a fish eye lens, although Hooper denied it, stating that he would normally have done something out of the ordinary for film photography Wide lenses are used
 roger abert ne kaha ki film ke adhikansh bhaag ko andar filmaaya gaya he, jahaan ytaakar set, koridor or chote sthaan sankare galiyaaron ko darshaate hai, jisase aitihaasik drama ke anusaar saamaanya rajasi prabhaav prakat nahin hota he
 Hooper has taken wide shots for acting actors, notably Geoffrey Rush who trained Jacques Lecoq in Paris at the l'ecole International Day Theater and "consequently looks quite impressive the way they deliver"
 hupar rash ke haavbhaav ko shoot karne ke liye pehle apane scope ko chaudaa karte hai, uske baad puure sharir kii gatividhiyon kaa shot liya jaataa he
 The same approach has also been used for Forth

 The film's score is composed by Alexander Desplat
 ek film jisamen ek vyakti apane aap main sudhaar karne ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he, desplate ne naatak kala kaa pradarshan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 She has reflected the challenge: "this is a film about the voice
 sangeet bhi usee ke anusaar hona chahie
 Let the music show the silence
 sangeet samay ke anusaar ho
"score main string or piano kaa upyog kiya gaya he, is prakaar ke sangeet kaa uddeshy he raja kii chuppi ke peeche chhipi udaasi ko darshana or uske or log ke bich mitrataa ko badhanaa
 This approach emphasizes the protagonist's struggle for control in the story
 desplate ne raja kii bhashaa kii samasya ko darshane ke liye ek hi note kaa baar baar upyog kiya he
 As the film progresses, the deepening music begins to reflect the close friendship between the two individuals, reaching the climax of the coronation scene
 mul rup se hupar is film ko sangeet ke bina bananaa chaahate the, haalanki desplate ne tark diya ki yahi kahani kaa vaastavik charmotkarsh hoga, yah vah bindu hoga jab un donon kii mitrataa is seemaa tak pahunch jaayegi ki ve ek duusare par bharosa karne lagenge
 "it's really rare" Des Plate said, "mostly we only have love stories
 "ek aavadhik dhwani kii rachana ke liye score ko microphone par record kiya gaya, jise vishesh rup se shahi parivaar ke liye banaaya gaya tha, ise EMI sangrahon se nishkarshith kiya gaya tha
 The score was nominated for several awards, including a nomination for "best Original Score" on Golden Globes, BAFTA and Oskar
 film ke clymex par 1939 ke radio bhaashan ke prasaaran ke dauraan bajaayaa gaya sangeet bithovan kii saatvin simphoni ke duusare movement se liya gaya he
 According to screenwriter David Seidler, director Tom Hooper tried as far as possible to maintain historical accuracy, the two worked together for four months to make the best screenplay possible and to be certified
 lyonal log ke pote ke saath ek bibisi saakshaatkaar ke anusaar, film kii team ko shooting se lagbhag nau maheene pehle log ke mul nots kii diary mil gayi thi, jisamen duk ke upachaar ke bare main likhaa gaya tha
 That's when he worked on the script once again according to the notes
 hupar ne kaha ki film kii kai yaadgaar line log ke nots se liye gaye pratyaksh uddhran hai
 However, certain changes have been made for dramatic and artistic reasons
 professor kathi shultz ne bataaya ki film nirmaataaon ne ghatnaon ke kalkram ko kuch varshon main samet liya he
 In fact, the Duke of York began working with Lionel Log in October 1926, ten years before the crisis of renunciation
 jaisaa ki film main darshaya gaya he bhashaa main sudhaar kai varshon ke bajaay kai maheenon main hua prathit hota he: jon gordan ke saath 1952 main akhbaar ke ek saakshaatkaar main, log ne kaha ki "hakalane kii samasya thik hone baad unhone 1927 main cannebra main australian sansad khol lee"; arthath duk ke log ke saath kaam shuru karne ke kuch maheene baad hi yah hua
 a royal advisor, Hugo Vickers, agreed that sometimes historical changes would have to be made to make some changes to preserve the essence of the play's story
 For example, high-ranking officials would not be present at the time the King spoke, Nor would Churchill have been involved in this at any stage, "but an average viewer knows who Churchill is; he does not know that Lord Halifax and Lord Hoare are Who is
 " Lionel's grandson, Robert Log, expressed doubts about the description of the language therapist in the film, stating, "I don't think he ever swore in front of the King and he certainly never called him 'bertie'" 
 itihaaskaar andrew roberts ne kaha ki raja ke hakalane kii gambhirtha ko atiranjit karke darshaya gaya he, edward VIII, velis simpasan or jorge v ke paatro ko vaastaviktaa se adhik virdohi darshaya gaya he, taaki naatakeey prabhaav ko badhaaya ja sake
 Christopher Hitchens and Isaac Chotinar challenged the film's portrayal of Winston Churchill's role in the crisis of renunciation
 yah janaa man tathy he ki churchill ne pad tyaag ke prati virodh prakat karne ke liye edward VIII ko protsaahit kiya tha, jabaki unhen film main prince albert ke samarthak ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he or pad tyaag ke khilaaf nahin darshaya gaya he
 Hitchens attributed this treatment to the "methodology" surrounding Churchill's legacy
 ek smart, acchhee tarah se bani film main, "kya ek sachhee kahani aanshik rup se darshakon ke liye adhik dilachasp nahin hoti?" vah aashcharyachakit he
 He also criticized the film for its failure to create appeasements of the era
 jabaki film main pratyaksh rup se mudde kaa ullekh nahin kiya gaya or chotinner kaa tark he ki jorge VI tushtikaran ke khilaaf tha, vishesh rup se antim drishy main jahaan "churchill or king buckingham peles main hai or ekta par bhaashan diya ja rahaa he or pratirodh kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 Keeping himself away from the Chamberlain appeasement policy, King George VI sent a car to meet Chamberlain when he returned in September 1938 by signing a Munich Agreement with Hitler
 tabhi king or chemberlen buckingham pales kii balkoni main khadey ho gaye, log unki jaijyakaar kar rahe the
 That is why historian Steven Rünseman wrote that King George VI, acting on Chamberlain's foreign policy, promoted "the greatest constitutional crisis which is the biggest mistake made by any king in this century
" " gargian ne stenle baldwin ke chithran main sudhaar kiya, iske liye unhone britain ke aayudh aadesh kii asweekruti ke liye istipha de diya, jab ve vastav main "rashtriya hero ke rup main saamne aaye, ek dashak se zyada choti par rahe
 " martin philler is baat se sahamat the ki choti swatantraaaen vastav main kalatmak license ko uchit tehraati hai, sambhavatya us kalpit drishy main jisamen jorge v apane putr ko prasaaran ke mahatv ke bare main bhaashan detaa he, ise ek sahi bindu bataata he
 George VI never tolerated that Logue would address him in an informal manner, nor did he swear, he probably understood German, and was actually a bit hot about Churchill, as his brother later relinquished the crisis
 Was supported in film ke antim drishy par tippanee dete hue, jab king buckingham peles kii balkoni main khadaa he, 3 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh kii ghoshnaa par bhaashan de rahaa he, andrew roberts likhaa he, "yah drishy aitihaasik drushtikon se betuka he- neville chemberlen or winston churchill maujuud nahin the or buckingham peles ke baahar jaijyakaar karne vaali koi bheed bhi nahin thi
 Overall, Roberts praises the film for its portrayal of King as a "quiet, submissive hero" and he says: "the portrayals by Firth and Bonheim Carter are sympathetic and intense and give the film's original factual vindictiveness Should not be different
 " The film premiered on September 4, 2010 at the Telluride Film Festival in the United States

 At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticized the decision, questioning how the rating of "15" attests to the film's bad language, despite its graphic torture scenes of Salt and Casino Royale being rated 12 A
 
 hupar kii aalochana ke baad, board ne isaki reating ko kam karke "12A" kar diya, saath hi anumati di gayi ki 12 varsh se kam umr ke bachche ek vyask ke saath baithkar is film ko dekh sakate hai

 Attempts to grow the vanilla plant outside of Mexico and Central America proved fruitless due to the symbiotic relationship between the vanilla orchid-producing tickschoit lata and the local species of Melipona fly; However, it became successful in 1837 after the discovery of this fact by the Belgian botanist Charles François Antoine Mauren and developed a method of artificial pollination of the plant
 par yah vidhi vittiya rup se kargar nahin rahi or ise vyavsaayik rup se nahin apanaaya gaya
 In 1841 Edmund Albius, a French-owned slave living in Ile Bourbon, discovered that the plant could be hand-pollinated, opening the way for the plant's global agriculture

 Vanilla is the second most valuable spice after saffron due to the intensive labor required to produce vanilla seed beans

 Despite its high price, vanilla is used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume manufacturing, and odor therapy
 pehle-pahal vanilla kii kheti karne vaale totonac log the, jo vartmaan ke veracruj praant ke mexico gulf coast par sthit mazaatlan ghati main rahete the
 According to Totonac's legend, when Princess Janet was prevented by her father from marrying a mortal, she fled to the forest with her lover, which resulted in the birth of tropical orchids
 premi yugal ko pakad kar unke sir kalam kar die gaye
 Wherever on the earth their blood fell, the tropes of tropical orchids rose

 Mexico was the main producer of vanilla until the 19th century

 reunion dweep ke ek 12 varshiya gulam edmund albius ne yah pataa lagaaya ki kaise iske phulon kaa haathon se sheeghra paragan karavaaya ja saktaa he or kaise isaki faliyaan murajhaane lagatee hai
 Shortly thereafter tropical orchids were sent from Réunion Island to Comoros Island and Madagascar with instructions for their pollination
 san 1898 tak madagascar, reunion or comoros dwipon ne 200 mitric ton vanilla faliyon kaa utpaadan kiya, jo duniya ke utpaadan kaa 80% hissaa tha
 The market price of vanilla rose dramatically in the late 1970s when a tropical cyclone devastated the mainland
 Prices did not decrease despite Indonesian vanilla coming into the market in the early 1980s
 The group, which had been distributing and pricing vanilla since 1930, was disbanded in the mid-1980s
 agle kuch saalon main vanilla kii keemat 70 fisadi tak kam hokar 20 america dollar prati kilogram tak pahunch gai, lekin april, 2000 main madagascar main aae ushnkaribandheey chakravaat huda kii vajah se keemten ek baar phir se teji se bad gayi
 Vanilla prices rose astonishingly to US $ 500 per kilogram in 2004 due to cyclones, political instability and inclement weather for the third consecutive year, causing new countries to step into the vanilla industry

 solahavin shatabdi ke aarambh main jab spain ke khojiyatri mexico kii khadi ke kinare pahunche, tab unhone vanilla ko uskaa maujuuda naam diya
 Spanish and Portuguese sailors and explorers brought vanilla to Africa and later to Asia in the same century
 unhone ise vainila, yaa “choti fali” kaha

 The main variety grown for vanillin is Vanilla planifolia
 Although originally a variety of Mexico, it is now widely cultivated in the tropical region
 madagascar duniya kaa sabase bada utpaadak he
 Other sources include Vanilla pompona and Vanilla tahiteensis, but the amount of vanillin present in these varieties is much less than Vanilla planifolia
 vanilla, ek maujuuda ped, khambhe yaa kisi or sahare par chadhate hue, ek lata ke rup main ugta he
 It can be grown in the forest, in the garden or on a "shader", in increasing order of productivity
 The climate of its produce is called terroir and includes not only the surrounding plants, but also the weather, geography and local geology
 ise akelaa chhod do to sahare par yah jitna ho saktaa he utana badhegi or kuch phool khilaaegi

 isse phool banane kii prakriya ko bhi kaaphi badhaava miltaa he
 Specific aromatic compounds are found in fruits, which are produced as a result of flower pollination
 ek phool ek fal ko janm detaa he
 Vanilla planifolia flowers are unisexual: they have both male and female organs present; However, these organs are separated by a membrane to avoid self-pollination
 phulon kaa prakritik paragan keval ek vishesh melipone makkhi dwaara hi ho saktaa he, jo mexico main pai jaati he
 Due to this fly, Mexico has had a long 300-year monopoly in vanilla production ever since it was first discovered by the Europeans and the French raised their vines over their foreign colonies and continued until these flies could find an alternative
 Was taken mexico ke baahar isaki lataaen to ugti thim, par unamem fal nahin lagate
 utpaadak is makkhi ko upaj vaale sthanon par le gaye par koi phayda nahin hua
 Artificial pollination is the only method of producing fruit without fly
 And today hand pollination is also being used extensively in Mexico
 san 1836 main vanaspati vaigyanik charles francois antony marren papentla ke angan main coffee pi rahe the, jis dauraan unka dhyaan kaali mackhiyon par gaya jo unki mej ke aage uge vanilla ke phulon ke ird-gird mandara rahi thim
 They watched the movements of the flies closely as they were working with a flutter inside the flower and in this process Makranda was being moved
 kuch ghanton ke bheetar hi phool band ho gaye or kai dinon ke baad marren ne paaya ki vanilla kii faliyaan banani shuru ho gayi
 Soon Maureen started experimenting with hand pollination
 kuch varshon ke baad san 1841 main ek 12 saal ke ladke ne, edmund albius jo ek gulam tha, reunion main haath dwaara paragan kii ek saral or prabhavi vidhi dhund nikaali, jiskaa aaj bhi prayog hota he
 a farm laborer removed the membrane separating the anther and stigma by a sharp-edged bamboo hide and then transferred the macaranda from the anther to the stigma using the thumb
 swa-paragan vaale phool main tab ek fal laga
 The vanilla flower survives for a day, sometimes even less, and therefore growers have to see flowers open daily in their garden, which is quite laborious work
 fal jo beej kaa sanfoot hota he, paudhe se hi laga rahane chhod diya jaataa he, jo pak kar antat khul jaataa he; jaise hi yah suukhta he phenolic yogic ravaakrut ho jate hai, jisase fali kaa aakaar heere ke churna-sa ho jaataa, jise francoisiyon ne givre kaa naam diya
 This then produces the distinctive aroma of vanilla
 fal main nanhe swadaheen beej hote hai
 In such dishes in which whole natural vanilla is added, these seeds look like black spots
 anya orchid bijon kii tarah vanilla beej kuch nishchit mykorijal kavak kii upasthiti ke bagaiyr ankurit nahin hota
 Growers in turn grow the plant by cutting: they remove six or more lump-shaped clumps, each with a root in front of the leaf

 The remaining upper root clings to the support, and then often grows in the soil

 French vanilla is not a type of vanilla, but is often used in the preparation of dishes that have a strong aroma of vanilla and contain vanilla grains
 yah naam vanilla faliyon, kriim tathaa andey kii zardi vaali icecream custard base banane kii francisi style se utpann hua he

 kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar kerala bhi uskaa janm sthaan bataaya jaataa he
 In this regard, the mention of the Charani river is given by him as proof of this
 kuch sandarbhon main yah ullekh miltaa he ki kerala nivasee vishnugupt tirthaton ke liye varanasi aayaa tha, jahaan uski putree kho gayi
 He did not return to Kerala again and settled in Magadha
 is prakaar ke vichaar rakhane vaale vidwaan use kerala ke kutullur namputree vansh kaa vanshaj maanate hai
 Many scholars consider him a native of Magadha
 kuch buddha saahitiyon ne use takshashiksha kaa nivasee bataaya he
 It is difficult to say with certainty where Kautilya's birthplace is because of the extreme differences, but based on many references it would be okay to consider Taxila as his birthplace
 ve
 ke
 subramanyam ne kaha he ki kai sandarbhon main is baat kaa ullekh miltaa he ki sikandar ko apane akraman ke abhiyaan main yuva kautilya se bhent hui thi
 Since Alexander's invasion was mostly in the Taxila region, it is expected that Kautilya's birthplace would have been in the Taxila region
 kautilya ke pita kaa naam chanak tha
 He was a poor Brahmin and lived in some way
 atah spasht he ki kautilya kaa bachapan garibi or dikkaton main gujara hoga
 There is no specific reference to Kautilya's initiation, but his intelligence and his scholarship are reflected in his thoughts
 vah kurup hote hue bhi shaareerik rup se balishtha tha
 An overview of his book 'arthashastra' gives a complete sense of his talent, his multi-faceted personality and foresight
 kautilya ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki vah bada hi swabhimani evam krodhi swabhaav kaa vyakti tha
 According to a legend, once King Mahananda of Magadha humiliated Kautilya on the occasion of Shraddha
 kautilya ne krodh ke vasheebhoot hokar apni shikha kholkar yah pratigya kii thi ki jab tak vah nandavansh kaa naash nahin kar degaa tab tak vah apni shikha nahin baandhenga
 This was also a major reason for Kautilya's entry into practical politics
 nandavansh ke vinaash ke baad usne chandragupta maury ko rajgaddi par baithne main har sambhav sahaayta kii
 After Chandragupta Maurya ascended the throne, he entered into practical politics with the aim of making him mighty and expanding the Mauryan Empire
 vah chandragupta maury kaa mantri bhi bana
 Many scholars have stated that Kautilya has nowhere said anything in his composition regarding the Mauryan dynasty or his ministry, but most sources have confirmed this fact
 'arthshaastra' main kautilya ne jis vijigishu raja kaa chithran prastut kiya he, nishchit rup se vah chandragupta maury ke liye hi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 Overwhelmed by the defeat of small states due to Alexander's invasion of India, Kautilya resolved to enter practical politics
 uski sarvopari ichha thi bharat ko ek gauravshaalee or vishaal rajya ke rup main dekhnaa
 Certainly Chandragupta Maurya was the focal point of his desire
 acharya kautilya ko ek ore paarangat or doordarshee raajnneetijna ke rup main maury samrajya kaa sansthaapak or sangrakshak mana jaataa he, to duusari ore use samskruti sahitya ke itihaas main apni athulaneey evam adbhut kriti ke kaaran apane vishay kaa ekmaatr vidwaan hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 Kautilya's wisdom, dexterity and foresight is well known in the scriptures, poems and other texts of India
 kautilya dwaara nandavansh kaa vinaash or mauryvansh kii sthapana se sambandhit katha vishnu puraana main aati he
 Despite being a great scholar and general secretary of the Maurya Empire, Kautilya's life was a life of simplicity
 vah 'sada jivan ucch vichaar' kaa sahi pratik tha
 He led a very simple life during his tenure as a minister
 vah ek chota-se makaan main rahata tha or kaha jaataa he ki uske makaan kii deevaaron par gobar ke upale thope rahete the
 He believed that a king or a minister with his character and high ideals could present a model to the people
 usne sadaiv maryaadaaon kaa paalan kiya or karmthata kii jindagi bitaayi
 Later, he is said to have renounced his ministerial career and led a Vanaprastha life
 vastutah use dhan, yash or pad kaa koi lobh nahin tha
 In essence, he was a 'vitiragi', 'ascetic, man of hard work and dignity, whose life is still exemplary
 ek prakand vidwaan tathaa ek gambhir chintak ke rup main kautilya to vikhyath he hi, ek vyaavhaarik evam chatur raajnneetijna ke rup main bhi use khyaati mili he
 He has a historical contribution in the destruction of the Nanda dynasty and the establishment and expansion of the Magadha Empire
 salator ke kathananusaar pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan main kautilya kaa sarvopari sthaan he
 Like Machiavelli, Kautilya has also attempted to separate politics from morality and study it as an independent scripture
 jaisaa ki kaahaa jaataa ha Kautilya's name, date of birth and birthplace have all been the subject of controversy
 kautilya ke naam ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 The first translator of Kautilya's 'arthashastra', Pandit Shamashastri, has used the name Kautilya
 'kautilya naam' kii pramanikta ko siddh karne ke liye pandit shaamasasthri ne vishnu-puraana kaa hawala diya he jisamen kaha gaya he— a controversy has arisen in this regard and that of Kautilya and Kautilya
 ganpati shastri ne 'kautilya' ke sthaan par 'kautaly' ko zyada pramanik mana he
 According to him, the name Kautalya appears to be correct and consistent due to being a Kutla gotra
 kaamandakeey nitishastra ke antargat kaha gaya he— Sambasiva Shastri has said that Ganapathi Shastri probably used the name Kautilya, considering Kautilya to be a descendant of the ancient saint Kutla, but there is no evidence that Kautilya was of the clan and clan of saint Kutal
 'kotilya' or 'kautaly' naam kaa vivaad or bhi kai vidwaanon ne uthaaya he
 V
A
 Ramaswamy has supported the statement of Ganapathi Shastri
 aadhunik vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he
 Western scholars have not given much importance to the controversy between Kautilya and Kautilya
 unke matanusaar is prakaar kii bhranti hijje ke her-pher ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Most Western writers have used the name Kautilya
 bharat main vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he, balki zyaadaatar kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Radhakanth's statement in this regard is also particularly notable
 usne apni rachana 'shabdakalpadram' main kaha he Many more names of Kautilya are mentioned
 jisamen chanakya naam prasiddh he
 Many scholars who have called Kautilya as Chanakya are of the opinion that he was called Chanakya because he was the son of Chanak
 duusari ore kuch vidwaanon ke kathananusaar uskaa janm punjab ke chanak kshetra main hua tha, isliye use chanakya kaha gaya he, yadhyapi is sambandh main koi spasht pramaan nahin miltaa he
 One thing is clear that Kautilya and Chanakya are the same person
 uparyukt naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh miltaa he, jaise vishnugupt
 It is said that his original name was Vishnugupta
 uske pita ne uskaa naam vishnugupt hi rakhaa tha
 Kautilya, Chanakya and Vishnugupta find many references related to the three names, but apart from these three names many other names are mentioned, such as Vatsyayan, Malang, Dravimal, Angul, Varanak, Katyan etc
 Which is the correct name and which is the wrong name, it is a matter of controversy
 parantu adhikansh paashchaatya or bhartiya vidwaanon ne 'arthshaastra' ke lekhak ke rup main kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Some Western scholars have put a question mark on the existence of Kautilya
 vinternij, jolly or kith ke matanusaar kautilya naam pratikatmak he, jo kootneeti kaa pratik he
 His views are supported by Kantilya's absence in his epics by Pantajali
 jolly ne to yahan tak kah daalaa he ki 'arthshaastra' kisi kautilya naamak vyakti kii kriti nahin he
 This is a text composed by another Pandit or Acharya
 shaamasasthri or ganapatishastri donon ne hi paashchaatya vichaarkon ke mat kaa khandan kiya he
 Both of them are convinced that Kautilya had complete existence, even if there is a difference in his names
 vastutah in teenon paashchaatya vidwaanon ke dwaara kautilya kaa astitv ko nakaarne ke liye jo bindu uthaae gaye hai, ve anargal evam mahatvaheen hai
 Western scholars say that Kautilya has not mentioned anywhere that he was an Amatya or a minister during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, hence the writing of that 'arthashastra' cannot be considered
 yah bachakaana tark he
 It is clear from many references to Kautilya that he, with the help of Chandragupta Maurya, destroyed the Nanda dynasty and established the Maurya Empire
 kautilya kii kritiyon ke sambandh main bhi kai vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 There is no definite information available regarding how many works of Kautilya are there
 kautilya kii sabase mahatpurna kriti arthshaastra kii charchaa sarvatra milti he, kintu anya rachanaaon ke sambandh main kuch vishesh ullekh nahin miltaa he
 Kamandaka, a disciple of Chanakya, has written in his treatise called 'nitisara' that Vishnugupta Chanakya extracted the nectar of ethics by churning the Mahomedi of economics from his intellect
 chanakya kaa 'arthshaastra' sanskrit main raajnneeti vishay par ek vilakshan granth he
 Shlokas of its policy are prevalent from house to house
 peeche se logon ne inke niti granthon se gata badhaakar vriddhchanakya, laghuchankya, bodhichanakya aadi kai nitigranth sankalit kar liye
 Chanakya was a scholar of all subjects
 'vishnugupt siddhant' naamak inkaa ek jyotish kaa granth bhi miltaa he
 It is said that he also has a book on Ayurveda called 'vaidyajivan'
 nyaay bhashyakaar vatsyayan or chanakya ko koi koi ek hi maanate hai, par yah bhram he jiskaa mul hemchand kaa yah shloke he: Thus the name of Kautilya has been associated with compositions called Dhatukautilya and Rajneeti
 kuch vidwaanon kaa yah maananaa he ki 'arthshaastra' ke alaava yadi kautilya kii anya rachanaaon kaa ullekh miltaa he, to vah kautilya kii sukhtiyon or kathanon kaa sankalan ho saktaa he
 Kautilya did not say anything explicitly about the origin of the state, but a few coincidental observations make it clear that he was in favor of a social settlement in place of the divine doctrine of the state
 hobbs, lock tathaa ruso kii tarah rajya kii utpatti se purv kii prakritik dasha ko vah araajaktaa kii sangya detaa he
 The state was born when, fed up with the law of 'fishery justice', people chose Manu as their king and agreed to give him one-sixth of their agricultural produce and one-tenth of gold
 iske badale main raja ne unki suraksha tathaa kalyaan kaa uttardaayitv sambhaala
 Kautilya is in favor of the monarchy
 kautilya ne paashchaatya raajnneetik chintakon dwaara pratipaadit rajya ke chaar aavashyak tattvon - bhoomi, jansankhya, sarkaar va samprabhutaa kaa vivaran na dekar rajya ke saat tattvon kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this regard, he does not give a definition of the state, but supports the already existing weekly theory
 kautilya ne rajya kii tulana maanav-sharir se kii he tathaa uske savyav rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 All the elements of the state work like organs of the human body inter-related, interdependent and together
 jansankhya main krishakon, udhyamiyon tathaa aarthik utpaadan main yogadan dene vaali praja sammilit he
 People should be loyal, hardworking and obeying the king's orders
 is prakaar kautilya kaa saptang siddhant rajya ke savyav swaroop kaa nirupan karte hue sabhi ango kii mahatvapurn bhoomika par prakaash daalata he
 Although this theory does not match the modern definition of the state, Kautilya's kingdom has all four elements of the modern state
 janapad bhoomi va jansankhya he, amaatya sarkaar kaa bhav he tathaa swami samprabhutta kaa pratik he
 The importance of the fund is in the administration, development and promotion and the army is necessary for internal peacekeeping and external security
 videshi maamalon main mitra mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, kintu durg kaa sthaan aadhunik yug main suraksha-pratiraksha ke anya upkarnon ne le liya he
 Following the ancient Indian political thought, Kautilya has also made the concept of monarchy the center of his thinking
 vah loukik maamalon main raja kii shakti ko sarvopari maanata he, parantu karttavyon ke maamalon main vah swayan dharm main bandhaa he
 He is not a lecturer of religion, but a protector
 kautilya ne rajya ko apane aap main saadhy maanate hue saamaajik jivan main use sarvocch sthaan diya he
 The interest of the state is paramount for which at times it even outpaces the principles of morality
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya kaa uddeshy keval shaanti-vyavastha tathaa suraksha sthapit karnaa nahin, varan vyakti ke sarvocch vikaas main yogadan dena he
 According to Kautilya the functions of the state are- vahya shatruon tathaa akramanakariyon se rajya ko surakshit rakhana, aantarik vyavastha nyaay kii raksha tathaa daivi vipattiyon- baadh, bukamp, durbhiksh, aag, mahamari, ghaatak jantuon se praja kii raksha raja ke kaary hai
 Varnashrama Dharma has been emphasized under Swadharma
 yadhyapi kautilya manu kii tarah dharm ko sarvopari maanakar rajya ko dharm ke adheen nahin karata, kintu praja dwaara dharm kaa paalan na kiye jane par raja dharm kaa sangrakshan karata he
 The duty of the king is to establish social justice for the general public
 saamaajik vyavastha kaa samuchit sanchaalan tabhi sanmbhav he, jabaki pita-putr, pati-patni, guru-shishy aadi apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah karen
 In the event of divorce, he emphasizes equal rights of men and women
 strivadh tathaa brahman-hatya ko gambheer aparaadh mana gaya he
 The scope of Kautilya's kingdom is very wide
 vah rajya ko maanav ke bahumukhi vikaas kaa daayitv saunpkar use aadhunik yug kaa kalyankari rajya bana detaa he
 He has given many tasks to the state
 jaise- band, talab va sinchai ke anya sadhano kaa nirmaan, khaanon kaa vikaas, banjar bhoomi kii jutai, pashupaalan, vanyavikas aadi
 Apart from these, public entertainment was under the control of the state
 anathon nirdhanon, apango kii sahaayta, stri sammaan kii raksha, punakhravvaah kii vyavastha aadi bhi rajya ke daayitv the
 Thus Kautilya's kingdom is the ubiquitous state
 jan-kalyaan tathaa achche prashasan kii sthapana uskaa lakshya he, jisamen dharm va naitikta kaa prayog ek saadhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Kautilya says, ek anya sthaan par usne likhaa he
 In this regard, Salletore's statement is, "the only purpose of the state which has power and authority is to increase the happiness of its subjects
" is prakaar kautilya ne ek kalyankari rajya ke kaaryon ko uchit rup main nirdeshit kiya he
 '' kautilya ne na keval rajya ke aantarik kaary, balki vahya kaaryon kii bhi vistaar se charchaa kii he
 In this regard, he discusses foreign policy, international relations and rules of war and peace
 kootneeti ke sambandhon kaa vishleshan karne hetu usne mandal siddhant pratipaadit kiya he- Kautilya described the policy adopted by various states towards other states in his mandala theory
 pracheen kaal main bharat main anek chote-chote rajyon kaa astitv tha
 Powerful kings expanded their empire by war
 rajya kai baar suraksha kii drushti se anya rajyon main samjhauta bhi karte the
 According to Kautilya, a king who expanded his empire through war and conquest should increase the number of friends of his enemies, so that enemies can be kept under control
 duusari ore nirbal rajyon ko shaktishaalee padosi rajyon se satark rahanaa chahie
 They should form a group or 'mandal' to avoid expansionary policy of powerful states in association with states of equal status
 kautilya kaa mandal siddhant bhugolic aadhaar par yah darshata he ki kis prakaar vijay kii ichha rakhane vaale rajya ke padosi desh uske mitra yaa shatru ho sakate hai
 According to this theory, there is a king in the center of the mandal, who is willing to win other states, it is called "vijigishu"
 ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ ke maarg main aane vaala sabase pehla rajya ‘‘ari’’ tathaa shatru se laga hua rajya ‘‘shatru kaa shatru’’ hota he, atah vah vijigeeshu kaa mitra hota he
 Kautilya has also described "moderate" and "indifferent" states, which, despite being powerful, do not participate in the strategy
 kautilya kaa yah siddhant yatharthwaad par aadhaarit he, jo yudhon ko anterrashtriya sambandhon kii vaastaviktaa maanakar sandhi va samjhaute dwaara shakti-santulan banane par bal detaa he
 Kautilya has described six types of policies for conducting foreign relations - kautilya ke anusaar raja dwaara in nitiyon kaa prayog rajya ke kalyaan kii drushti se hi kiya janaa chahie
 Kautilya described the four principles of diplomacy with respect to the foreign policy of the state
 kautilya ke anusaar pratham do siddhanton kaa prayog nirbal raajaaon dwaara tathaa antim do siddhanton kaa prayog sabal raajaaon dwaara kiya janaa chahie, kintu uskaa yah bhi mat he ki sam daam se, daam bhed se or bhed dand se shreyaskar he
 Punishment should be used as a last resort, because it also causes damage to oneself
 kautilya ne guptcharon ke prakaaron va kaaryon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he
 The undercover students could have been as homemakers, ascetics, businessmen and poisoners
 rajdoot bhi guptchar kii bhoomika nibhaate the
 Their task was to convey secret information of the country and abroad to the king
 ye janamat kii sthiti kaa aankalan karne, vidrohiyon par niyantran rakhane tathaa shatru rajya ko nasht karne main yogadan dete the
 Kautilya has suggested to keep the spies satisfied by giving them money and honor by the king
 logo ke jivan main mahapurushon ke vichaaro kaa kaaphi prabhaav hota he
 Chanakya's thoughts have also advanced the lives of many people
 chanakya kii kootneeti or iske sidhanto ke bare main kai pustake likhi gayi he
 There is a large section that reads Chanakya's life and follows it
 chanakya ke vichaaro ko anmol kaha jaataa he
 Chanakya's views are well liked by teachers, politicians and business people
 acharya chanakya kaa gauravshaalee vyaktitv ke bare main padhane se nai urja kaa sanchaar hota he
 Kautilya's thoughts are still inspiring
 yah satya he ki kautilya ne raashtra kii raksha ke liye gupt pranidhiyon ke ek vishaal sanghathan kaa varnan kiya he
 For Shatruksha, there is a law for poisonous, miscellaneous, ceremonial use, abhinaya mantra etc
 unethical and inappropriate measures and for the purpose of this great money expenditure and loss of money have also been declared in accordance with the national policy
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main aisi charchaaon ko dekhakar hi mudrarakshaskaar kavi vishakhadutt chanakya ko kutilamati kaha he or banbhatta ne ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko ‘nirgun’ tathaa ‘atinrushanspryopadeshm’ kahkar nindit batalaaya he
 In a newly available historical work titled 'manjushree Moolakalp', Kautilya has been portrayed as 'durmati', Krodhan and 'papak', the character of Garha
 praachyavidya ke visheshgy anek aadhunik paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi uparyukt aniatik vyavasthaaon ko dekhakar kautilya kii tulana europe ke prasiddh lekhak or raajnneetijna mekiyavali se kii he, jisane apni pustak ‘da prince’ main raja ko lakshya-prapti ke liye uchit anuchit sabhi sadhano kaa aashray lene kaa upadesh diya he
 Western scholars, etc
 Western scholars demonstrate the following similarities between Kautilya and Mekiavali: kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main aisi sadrushta dikhaanaa yuktisangat nahin
 Of course, Kautilya was also a realist like Mekiavali and was not merely a follower of idealism
 parantu yah kahana ki kautilya ne dharm yaa naitikta ko sarvatha tilanjali de di thi, satyata ke vipareet hoga
 Kautilya established itself in the first tribunal of 'arthashastra'; arthath- raja praja ko apane dharm se chyut na hone de
 The king should also conduct his religion
 jo raja apane dharm kaa is bhaanti aacharan karata he, vah is lok or paralok main sukhi rahata he
 In this very first tribunal, emphasis has also been laid by the king on arranging immortals and orders have been given to strengthen varna and ashram system
 yahaan par trayee tathaa vaidic anushthan ko praja ke sangrakshan kaa mul aadhaar batalaaya gaya he
