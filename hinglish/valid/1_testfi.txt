 But his friend Patroclus gets irritated seeing this plight of his side and he gets the command to fight in the war with the Akilis
 ekilies usko apana kavach bhi de detaa he or apane mirmidan sainikon ko bhi uske saath yuddh karne ke liye bhej detaa he
 Patroclus drives out Eileen's army, but in the end he is killed by the Healer of Heelian

 They are usually made up of five structural units — each with two large and heavy chains and two small and light chains — that together, for example, monomers with one unit, two units Together with dimers and five units make pentamers
 pratipind ek prakaar kii safed rakt koshika se nirmit hote hai jinhen plavika koshika kaha jaataa he
 Antibody heavy chains and antibodies are also of many different types, collectively forming different types of isotypes based on their heavy chains
 stanadhariyon main paanch vibhinn prakaar ke pratipind gyaat hai, jo alag alag kaary karte hai, tathaa ve vibhinn prakaar ke bahya padaarth se ladane ke liye uchit pratiraksha pratikriya ko jaanane main sahaayta karte hai
 Although the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, the small region at the tip of the protein is highly variable, allowing millions of antibodies or antigens with slightly different tip structures to remain in existence
 is kshetra ko atyaadhik parivartansheel kshetra ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Each of these variants can bind to another target called an antigen
 pratipindon main yah vishaal vividhta pratiraksha pranali ko samaan rup se vishaal vividhta vaale pratijanon ke prakaaron ko pahchaanane main sahaayta karti he
 The specific part of the antigen identified by the antibody is called the epitope
 ye apitope apane pratipind ke saath atyaadhik vishisht prakriya dwaara jud jate hai, jise indused feet kehete hai, tathaa jo sharir kii rachana ke liye jimmevaar lakhon vibhinn anuon ke bich pratipind ko keval apane vishisht pratijan ko pahchaanane tathaa uske saath judane kii anumati dete hai
 Identification of an antigen by an antibody marks it for attack by other parts of the immune system
 pratipind lakshyon ko sidhe bhi beasar kar sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, rogazanq ke hisse ke saath jud kar, jo sankraman kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 a large and diverse population of antibodies is made up of random combinations of gene segments that encode sites that link different antigens), followed by random position changes in this region of the antigen gene, which further increases diversity
 pratipind jin bhi varg parivartan prakriya dwaara khud ko phir se sangathit kar ke baari shrinkhalaa ke aadhaar ko duusare main parivartit kar ke, pratipind kaa alag prakaar kaa isotip banaate hai jo pratijan vishesh ke badlaav kshetra ko banaae rakhata he
 This allows a single antibody to be used by many different parts of the immune system
 pratipindon kaa utpaadan shaareerik pratiraksha pranali kaa mukhya kaary he
 Surface immunoglobulin binds to the membrane of b cells affected by its transmembrane region, whereas the antibody is a secretory type of Ig and lacks the transmembrane region, so antibodies can be secreted into the bloodstream and soft parts of the body
 
 parinamswaroop, trans membren kshetron ke alaava, sarphase aiji / Ig or pratipind samaan hai
 Therefore, they are known as two types of antibody: soluble type or membrane bound type
 ek pratipind ke membren bound prakaar ko akknchakkibnkshdkk / fbbggil2jhfri2olu3firi bbsarphes immunoglobulin yaa membren immunoglobulin kaha ja saktaa he
 It is a part of the b cell receptor), which allows the b cell to detect specific antigens in the body and initiates b cell activation
 bisiar sarphase-bound aijidi yaa ijiem se mil kar bana hota he or isamen Ig-α or Ig-β hitrodimer jude hote hai, jo sanket hastantarit karne main sakasham hai

 manushyon main, bi koshika receptor ke chaaron ore kai hazaar angstorms ke liye koshika sataha nangi hoti he, jo aage chal kar bisiar ko pratispardhi prabhaavon se alag karti he
 Antibodies are available in different types called isotypes or classes
 standhari bhrunon main paanch tarah ke pratipind isotip paae jate hai jinhen ijie, aijidi, ijii, aijiji or ijiem kehete hai
 These all begin with the prefix Ig, which means immunoglobulin, which is another name for the antibody, and varies in its biological properties, functional locations, and ability to deal with different antigens, as described above
 Is shown in koshika ke vikaas or sakriyan ke dauraan bi koshika ke pratipind isotip parivartit hote hai
 Immature b cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, are known as simple b cells and express only the igm isotype in the cell surface bound form
 paripakvata kii sthiti tak pahunchane par bi koshikaayen ijiem va aijidi, donon ko vyakt karne lagati hai-in donon immunoglobulin isotipon kii sah-abhivyakti bi koshika ko 'paripakv' tathaa pratijan ke liye pratikriya karne ke liye taiyaar karti he
 b cell activation is followed by the process of the joining of an antigen-linked molecule with an antigen, which causes the cell to divide and transform into an antigen-forming cell called a plasma cell
 is sakriy avasthaa main bi koshika, membren bound form kii bajaae srav ke rup main pratipind utpann karne lagati he
 Some progeny cells of activated b cells undergo a process of isotype change, a mechanism that converts igm or igd of antibodies to another entabody isotype ige / ige, iga / iga or igg / igg, whose defined roles in the immune system
 Occur
 pratipind baari gol aakaar ke plavika protein hai
 Some of their amino acid residues have sugar chains attached to them
 duusare shabdon main, pratipind glycoprotein hai
 The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin monomer; Secreted antibodies can be dimeric with two Ig / Ig units, like iga / iga, tetrameric with four Ig / Ig units, like igm of teleost fish, or pentameric with five Ig / Ig units like igm of mammals
 pratipind ke asthir hisse iske ve / v kshetra or sthir hisse si / c kshetra hai
 The Ig monomer is a "Y" shaped molecule consisting of four polypeptide chains, two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains joined by disulfide bonds
 prayek shrinkhalaa sanrachanaatmak prabhaav-kshetra se mil kar banati he jinhen immunoglobulin prabhaav kshetra kaha jaataa he
 These effect areas contain 70–110 amino acids and they have been classified into various categories according to their size and functions
 inamen ek vishisht immunoglobulin tah hoti he, jisamen do beta shit "sandwich" kaa aakaar banaati hai tathaa jo sangrakshit sistine tathaa duusare aaweshit ameenon amlon kii paraspar prakriyaaon dwaara judi rahati hai
 Five types of Ig / Ig heavy chains are found in mammals, represented by Greek letters: α, δ, ε, γ and μ
 darshaayi gayi baari shrinkhalaa kaa prakaar pratipind ke varg ko paribhaashit karata he; ye shrinkhlaayein kramshah ijie, aijidi, ijii, ijiji, va ijiem main pai jaati hai
 Typical heavy chains vary in size and structure; α and γ contain about 450 amino acids, while μ and ε have about 550 amino acids
 prayek baari shrinkhalaa ke do kshetra hote hai - sthir kshetra or asthir kshetra 
 sthir kshetra samaan isotip ke sabhi pratipindon main ek jaisaa hota he, lekin vibhinn prakaar ke isotip ke pratipindon main alag hota he
 The stable region of the heavy chains γ, α and δ is made up of three tandem Ig / Ig effect regions, and the hinge region for added flexibility, while the constant regions of μ and ε are composed of four immunoglobulin effect regions
 baari shrinkhalaa kaa asthir kshetra vibhinn bi koshikaon dwaara utpaadit pratipindon ke anusaar alag hota he, kintu ekal bi koshika yaa bi koshika clon dwaara utpaadit sabhi antibody ke liye samaan hota he
 The volatile region of each heavy chain is as long as 110 amino acids and is composed of a single Ig / Ig effect region
 stanadhariyon main do prakaar kii immunoglobulin halki shrinkhlaayein hoti hai jinhen lambda or kappa kaha jaataa he
 a light chain has two successive spheres: a static sphere and a volatile sphere
 The length of the light chain is approximately 211 to 217 amino acids
 prayek pratipind main do halki shrinkhlaayein hoti hai, jo sadaiv ek jaisi hoti hai; stanadhariyon main ek pratipind main keval ek prakaar kii halki shrinkhalaa κ yaa λ maujuud hoti hai
 The second type of light chains, such as the iota series, are found in lower-grade backbones such as the chondricthis and teleostei
 pratipind ke kuch hisson ke vishisht kaary hai
 For example, the arms of y have a location that binds antigens and, thus, identify specific foreign objects
 pratipind ke is kshetra ko faib kshetra kaha jaataa he
 It is made up of one stable and one unstable region of each heavy and light chain of antibodies
 paratope halki va baari shrinkhalaaon ke vibhinn prabhaav kshetra dwaara antibody monomer ke amino terminal chor par sthit hota he
 The unstable region is also called the FV / FV region and is the most important region for the addition of antigens
 vishesh rup se halki shrinkhalaaon par sthit prayek teen asthir challe, jo antigen ko baandhane ke liye jimmedaar hai
 These rings are called catalytic fixation zones
 pratiraksha network siddhant kii sanrachana main, sidiaar / CDR ko idiotip bhi kaha jaataa he
 According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by the processes of idiotypes
 y kaa aadhaar pratiraksha koshika kii gatividhi ko vyavasthit karata he
 This region is called the FC / Fc region, and is made up of two heavy chains that contribute two or three fixed impact zones depending on the square of the antibody
 kisi vishesh protein ke saath jud kar epasi / Fc kshetra yah sunishchit karata he kii prayek pratipind die gayi pratijan ke prati upyukt pratiraksha pratikriya kare
 epasi / Fc kshetra duusare koshika receptor jaise epasi / Fc receptor tathaa duusare pratiraksha anuon jaise poorak proteinon ke saath bhi judata he
 By doing so, it mediates various physiological effects including opsonization, cell degeneration, including degranulation of mast cells, connective tissue cells, and white blood cells
 sakriy bi koshikaayen yaa to ghulansheel antibody main sravit hone vaali pratipind utpaadak koshikaon, jinhen plavika koshikaayen bhi kehete hai, main yaa sharir main lambe samay tak bani rahane vaali smriti koshikaon main antar karti hai, taaki pratiraksha pranali pratijan ko yaad rakh sake tathaa inke punah prakat hone par twarit pratikriya kar sake
 In the prenatal and neonatal stages of life, antibodies are obtained by passive immunization from the mother
 shuruuaati antarjaat pratipind utpaadan vibhinn prakaar ke pratipindon ke liye alag alag hota he or saamanytah jivan ke pratham varsh ke bheetar prakat hota he
 Since antibodies are free in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the physical immune system
 pravaah karne vaale pratipind chlonal bi koshikaon dwaara utpann kiye jate hai jo vishesh rup se keval ek pratijan ke liye pratikriya karti hai 
 pratipind teen tarah se roganashak kshamta ke prati yogadan dete hai
 They associate with pathogens to prevent them from entering or destroying cells; They stimulate white blood cells and other cells to destroy the pathogens by coating the pathogen; And they stimulate other curative reactions, such as the catalytic pathway, to initiate the destruction of pathogens
 pratijan kii sataha se judane vaale pratipind, udhaaharan ke liye ek jeevanu, utprerak prakriya ke pehle ghatak ko apane epasi / Fc kshetra se aakarshith karte hai or "utkrisht" utprerak pranali ke sakriyan kii shuruyaat karte hai
 As a result, bacteria die in two ways
 pehle tareeke main, osponiteeshan prakriya dwaara pratipind or utprerak anu, sookshmjeev ko fagocite dwaara khaane ke liye chinhit karte hai, ye fagocite utprerak prakriya se utpann utprerak anuon dwaara aakarshith hote hai
 In the other way, some components of the catalytic system form membranous invasive groups to aid the antibody in killing bacteria directly
 koshikaon ke baahar swayan ko dohraane vaale rogakaarakon kaa muqabla karne ke liye, pratipind unhen aapas main ikaitha karne ke liye ek saath baandh dete hai, jisase ve chipak jate hai
 Since a single antibody has at least two paratopes, they can bind more than one antigen by adding similar epitopes on the surface of these antigens
 rogakaarakon kii coating dwaara, antibody koshikaon main un prerak kaaryon ko rogakaarakon ke khilaaf uttejit karte hai jo unka epasi / Fc kshetra pahachaanate hai
 Cells that identify coded pathogens have Fc / Fc receptors, as the name suggests - iga, igg and ige process with the Fc / Fc region of antibodies
 kisi vishesh koshika par epasi / Fc receptor ke saath kisi vishesh pratipind kaa judaav us koshika main prerak kriya ko badhaava detaa he, fagocite fagocitos ho jayega, mast koshikaayen or neutrophills digrenulate ho jaayengi, prakritik hatyari koshikaayen cytocain va cytotoxic anu chodengi jo antat hamalavar sookshm jeevon kaa vinaash karengi
 epasi / Fc receptor isotip par aadhaarit hai jo vishisht rogakaarakon ke liye keval upyukt pratiraksha tantra ko jaagrit karte hai, jisase roganashak pranali ko atyadhik lacheelaapan miltaa he
 Humans and above-level mammals also produce "natural antibodies" that are present in the serum prior to viral infection
 prakritik antibody ve pratipind hai jo bina kisi pichley sankraman, tikaakaran, anya bahari pratijan se sampark yaa niskriy tikaakaran dwaara utpann hote hai
 These antibodies can activate the excellent catalytic pathway to degrade virus particles before the adaptive immune process is activated
 kai prakritik pratipindon ko disekaride glactose α-glactose ke khilaaf nirdeshit kiya jaataa he, jo glicosilated cell sarphase protein par terminal sugar ke rup main paae jate hai or manushya kii aant main sthit jeevanuon dwaara is sugar ke utpaadan ke khilaaf utpann hote hai
 Rejection of organ transplants is thought to be the reason that natural antibodies circulating in the recipient's serum bind to the α-gal antigens of donor tissues

 Farmers in North America are called cowboys, traditionally horse-riding, and often perform a variety of other farm-related tasks

 Cowgirls, first defined as such at the end of the 19th century, have little documentary evidence of their historical role, but have established their ability to do exactly the same thing in the modern world and received considerable respect for their achievements

 It is derived from the word waka, meaning "cow", which comes from the Latin word wakka
 couboy ke liye ek anya angreji shabd he bakaaru, jo ki vakuero kaa hi angrejikaran he
 At least one linguist speculates that the word bakaru is derived from the Arabic word bakra or bakhara, which also means "hyphener" or "heifer", and that the word may have entered Spanish during centuries of Islamic rule
 is
 multah, shabdic rup se is shabd kaa kaa arth ho saktaa he- "ek ladkaa jo gaayon kii dekhbhaal karata he

 The terms "cowhand" in 1852 and "cowpoke" appeared in 1881, which were originally used only for people transporting cattle in train coaches with a long sack for shipping
 Cowboys' names in American English include bakaru, cowpok, cowhand and cowpuncher

 In the United States, some women also took care of cattle and learned the necessary skills, although the "cowgirl" was not widely recognized or acknowledged until the late 19th century
 aaj pashchimi pashu formon main aam taur par vayask couboy karyrat hai
 Responsibility for cattle or other cattle is no longer considered suitable for children or early adolescents
 However, both boys and girls, who grow up in an animal farm environment, often learn horse riding and begin to demonstrate the basic skills of the farm, usually under the supervision of adults, when physically competent

 Various aspects of the Spanish equestrian tradition can be seen as a mark of Arab rule in Spain, as well as the use of Eastern-type horses, characterized by a small stirrup La Geneta rider style, the use of strong lumbar gin and aids, Elements of the Moors, such as heavy nakel or hakamor, and other equipment and technology associated with horses are also included

 During the 16th century, Conquistadores and other Spanish colonies carried with them the tradition of rearing horses and other cattle in the Americas, beginning with what is now Mexico and Florida

 American cowboys were drawn from many sources
 From the late 1860s, after the American Civil War and the expansion of the cattle industry, former soldiers from both the Union and the Union of States moved west, demanding work, as a large number of impatient whites generally did
 badi sankhya main bandhanmukt africa-americanyon ne bhi couboy jivan main pravesh kiya, aanshik rup se isaki ek vajah yah he ki us samay america samaaj ke anya kshetron kii apeksha pashchim main utana adhik bhedbhaav nahin tha
 a large number of Mexican and American Indians living in that area also worked as cowboys
 anek praarambhik vakuero indian the, jinhen spanish mishnon main maweshiyon kii dekhbhaal ke liye prashikshit kiya gaya tha
 Later, especially after 1890, when the American policy of "annexation" was formed with the Indian people, animal husbandry was also introduced in some Indian residential schools

 Since cowboys used to be lower in the social structure of that period, no firm figures on the actual proportions of different races are available
 ek lekhak ne kaha he ki couboy "

 To determine their ownership over animals, a specific brand would be marked on them, for this hot iron was used, usually when cattle were calves
 The primary cattle seen in the open range or location were clovehorns, which originated from the original Spanish loghorn imported in the 16th century; Although other breeds of cattle were also brought west in the late 19th century, they include meat-rich Hereford and were often cross-breeding with cloves

 a large number of horses were required for the cattle roundup
 Each cowboy required three to four fresh horses for a day's work
 The horses themselves used to get assembled
 It was common practice in the West that young calves born to domesticated mares were left "wild" in a semi-wild environment of open space
 vahaan "banaile" jhund bhi hua karte the, praayah jinhen mustangs naam se janaa jaataa he
 Both types were collected and developed and animals were made useful, a process known as horse breaking or "bronco-busted", usually done by cowboys who specialize in training horses
 In some cases, extremely cruel methods were used to tame horses and such animals were never fully reliable
 haalanki, anya couboy ne pashuon ke saath adhik maanviya dhang se bartaav karne kii jarurat mahasoos kii or apni ghoda prashikshan paddati main sudhaar kiya, aksar hi vakuero dwaara istemaal kii gayi takneekon ko phir se siikhaa gaya, khaskar californio parampara kii takneekon ko

 Prior to the mid-19th century, most animal farm owners primarily ran cattle for their own needs and sold surplus meat and hides locally
 vibhinn nirmaan prakriyaaon main khaal, sing, khur or vasa kaa bazaar bhi simit tha
 Nationally, before 1865, the demand for beef was also low
 haalanki, america grih yuddh kii samaapti ke baad philip dannforth armar ne chicago main maance packing kaa ek plant kholaa, jo armar and company naam se janaa jane laga or maance packing udyog ke vistaar se gomance kii maang main ullekhneey vruddhi hui
 From 1866, cattle could be sold in northern markets at a rate of $ 40 per head, making it potentially profitable to rearing cattle away from the market, especially from Texas
 pehali baar 1866 main maweshiyon ko bade paimaane par chicago ke liye potvahan ke makasad se texas se kareeb ke railway stesan le jane kaa prayaas kiya gaya; us samay anek pashu farm maalik sabase kareebi railway stesan, jo us samay cedalia, misuri main tha, tak apane maweshiyon ko le jane ke liye ekajute hue
 haalanki, purvi consas ke kisaan dare hue the ki laungorn se sthaneey maweshiyon ko maveshi fever ho ja saktaa he, saath hi fasalon ke ronde jane kaa bhi dar tha, is kaaran vahaan ke kisaanon ne samoohon kaa gathan kiya or chetavanee di ki unki jameen par paae jane vaale maveshi karmiyon ko peeta jayega yaa goli maar di jaayegi
 isliye, 1866 kaa yah abhiyaan railmarg tak pahunch paane main vifal rahaa or maweshiyon ke jhund kam keemat par bech die gayi
 However, in 1867, a cattle shipping facility was built to the west of Farm Country around the railway station in Abilene, Kansas, and the site became a hub for cattle shipping, with 36,000 head of cattle transported that year
 texas se abilene kaa wo rasta chisholm maarg se janaa jane laga, kyonki us raste ko jessi chisholm ne chihnit kiya tha
 It passed through present-day Oklahoma, which was then Indian territory
 haalanki, pashchim ke hollywood ke chitranon ke baavjood, desi americanyon ke saath apekshaakrit kam sangharsh the, jo aam taur par prati maveshi das saint ke path kar ke evaj main maweshiyon ke jhund ko jane kii anumati de diya karte the
 Later, other routes were built for various railway stations, including Dodge City and Wichita, Kansas
 1877 tak, doj city, consas jaise maveshi-potvahan ke bade shaharon se 500,000 maweshiyon kaa potvahan kiya ja chukaa tha
 In balancing cattle, it was necessary to maintain a balance between the speed of the cattle and their weight
 jabaki maweshiyon ko ek din main 25 mile tak haanka ja saktaa he, lekin isse unka vajan itnaa adhik kam ho jaataa ki manzil tak pahunchakar unhen bech paanaa mushkil ho jaataa
 aamtaur par unhen pratidin kam duuri tak le jaaya jaataa, unhen aaraam karne or dopaher tathaa raat main unhen charne diya jaataa
 ausatan, ek pashu samooh pratidin 15 mile chalakar apana swasth vajan banaaye rakh saktaa he
 This speed meant that it used to take two months to reach the railway station from the animal farm
 udhaaharan ke liye, chisholm maarg, 1,000 mile lanbaa tha
 On an average, there were about 3,000 cattle in a hank campaign of a herd of cattle
 At least 10 cowboys were needed to move the cattle to the herd, and one cowboy required three horses
 maweshiyon kii nigaraanee ke liye couboy 24 ghante paali main kaam kiya karte, din ke samay unhen sahi disha main le jane ke liye or raat main bhagdad or choron ko rokane ke liye
 The personnel also included a cook, who drove a feeding vehicle, usually a bullock and an horseman, with Remuda or additional horses
 At the time of the cattle drive, Ashwapala was often a very young cowboy or of low social status, but the cook would have been a highly respected member of the crew, who was not only in charge of the food, but also had medical supplies
 She used to have improper knowledge of experimental medicine
 1880 ke dashak tak, maveshi udyog ke vistaar ke kaaran atirikt khule sthanon yaa hadon kii jarurat mahasoos kii jane lagi
 Many animal farm owners then expanded to the northwest, where even then the undeveloped large grasslands existed
 texas ke maveshi uttar kii ore rocky mountain west or dakota main chale gayi
 Cowboys adapted themselves to the cold conditions and the westward industry intertwined itself with many regional traditions from California to Texas, often incorporating the most useful elements of each
 1880 ke dashak main shuru hue kantedaar taar maweshiyon ko ek kshetra vishesh main hi roke rakhte the, taaki maveshi us ilaake main seemaa se adhik char na len
 texas or aasapaas ke kshetron main, jansankhya vruddhi ke kaaran pashu farm maalikon ko apni-apni bhoomi ko gher lene kii jarurat mahasoos hui
 In the north, over-the-limit variability in the open area would have led to a lack of fodder for cattle in the winter, leading to starvation, especially during the dreaded winter of 1886–1887, when millions of cattle died in the northwest , Causing the collapse of the cattle industry
 1890 ke dashak tak, uttari samtal kshetron main bhi kantedaar taar kii baad maanak ban gayi, adhikansh raashtra ko samavisht karne ke liye railmarg kaa vistaar hua or bade pashu farm kshetron ke kareeb maance packing plant banaae gayi, isse texas se consas ke railway steshnon tak maweshiyon ko laane kaa lanbaa haank abhiyaan anaavashyak ho gaya
 Because of this, the open area came to an end and large cattle herd campaigns came to an end
 Small hank expeditions of cattle continued until at least the 1940s, as farm owners still needed to herd cattle to local railway stations for transportation to stockyards and packing plants, before modern cattle trucks were built

 Over time, the cowboys of the American West developed their own personal culture, an amalgam of frontier and Victorian values that also retained remnants of heroism
 pruthak paristhitiyon main is tarah ke khatarnaak kaam ne aatm-nirbharta or vyaktvaad kii parampara kaa bhi nirmaan kiya, vyaktigat eemaandaaree par khaasaa jor diya gaya, geet or kavita ke drushtaant prastut kiye gayi
 However, some men went to the frontier because they were attracted to men
 In an area where the number of men outnumbered that of women, even in the social events where people of both genders participated, only men were filled and there were men dancing for each other

 Homosexual relationships were established between young and unmarried men, but cowboy culture itself remained deeply homophobic
 haalanki puraane pashchim main samalangikta-virdohi kaanoon aam the, lekin aksar unhen chaynaatmak rup se hi lagu kiya jaataa tha
 In the late 19th and early 20th century, the development of the Wild West show further emboldened the cowboy traditions, working in the minds of the common people, which showcased and thrilled the lives of cowboys and homegrown Americans
 1920 ke dashak se shuru karke aaj tak pashchimi filmon ne couboy jivan style ko lokapriy banaaya, lekin saath hi saath sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak donon hi rup main nirantar purvaagrah kaa bhi nirmaan kiya

 pashchim main mahilaon or khaskar pashu formon main kaam karne vaali mahilaon kaa itihaas purushon jaisi acchhee tarah se pralekhith nahin he
 However, institutions such as the National Cowgirl Museum and the Hall of Fame have made significant efforts in recent years in collecting women's contributions and preparing their documents
 aise kuch record uplabdh hai jinamein old west ke maveshi margon tak mahilaon dwaara maweshiyon ko haankane ke ullekh milte hai
 However, women have done considerable work in animal farms and in some cases even run them
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki mahilaon, khaskar un chote formon ke maalikon kii patniyon or betiyon ne purushon ke kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaam kiya he, jo badi taadaad main bahari majdoor nahin rakh sakate the; or isiilie unhen ghudsawaari or sambandhit kaary puure karne kii kaabiliyat kii jarurat padati

 By 1900, split-split skirts for riding became popular, and women were allowed to wear men's clothing or, worse, trousers without condemning Victorian-era audiences for competing with men

 Independently of the entertainment industry, the development of rodeos exposed another type of cowgirl - rodeo cowgirl
 In the early Wild West shows and rodeos, women started participating in all the competition, sometimes against other women or sometimes with men
 Cowgirls like Fannie Sperry Steele rode in "rough stock" like men and took the same risks and also competed in big rodeo competitions such as the Calgary Stampede and Cheyenne Frontier Days
 1925 ke baad mahilaon ke liye rodio pratiyogita badal gayi, jab purvi promotaron ne medisson squaire garden jaisi jagahon main indoor rodio rakhni shuru kii
 Women were generally eliminated from the men's competition and many of the women's competitions were reduced

 Boys and girls are much more eager to compete among themselves in high school rodeo and o-mok-si competition, where boys can also be seen competing in "women's" events such as barrel racing
 rodio vishwa ke baahar, olympic sahit lagbhag sabhi ghudsawaari pratispardhaon main purushon ke samaan hi bhaag liya karti hai or kating, lagaam lagane or dhairya jaisi paashchaatya sawari main bhi hissaa le sakati hai
 Today's working cowgirls generally use men-like clothing, tools, and materials, although they generally prefer different colors and designs to look attractive in competition
 sidsadel sirf pradarshaniyon or ek simit sankhya ke vishesh ghudsawaari sho kakshaon main dekhi jaati hai
 The cowgirl wears jeans, tight shirts, shoes, hats and chaps and gloves when needed

 Differentiation from one part of the United States is observed in the development of cattle handling practices and equipment due to geography, climate, and cultural traditions

 Less well-known but equally distinct traditions also developed in Hawaii and Florida

 The popular "horse whisper" style of natural equestrian art was originally developed by professionals from the states of California and the Northwest, a clear combination of the vision and vision of California vaquero with equipment and the outward vision of the Texas Cowboys

 California's vaquero or buckaroo were considered highly skilled workers, compared to Texas cowboys, who usually lived in the same farm where they were born or where they grew up and formed their own family
