 british vaastukar sar edwin landsier lootyans ko, jo ki nagar yojana ke pramukh sadsy the, is imaarat sthal kii abhiklpana kaa kaarybhaar saunpa gaya
 According to its original plan, it was to create something that was a mixture of Eastern and Western styles
 kuch logon kii raay main yah mahal paramparaagat style kaa hona chaiye tha, jo ki pracheen unani style main hota
 But it would have been an apparently Western power show in India, which was invalid
 vahiin duusari ore kai logon kaa mat tha, ki yah purnatya bhartiya style kaa ho
 Several ratios of mixtures of these two were also proposed
 tab viceroy ne kaha, ki mahal paramparaagat hoga, parantu bhartiya motiff ke bina
 This was the design that stands today in tangible form
 yah mahal lagbhag usee rup main bana, jo ki lootyans ne baker ko shimla se 14 june 1912 ko bheja tha
 Lutyens's design was largely traditional, inspired by Indian architecture in color, detail, etc
, as well as by the Viceroy's order
 lootyans or baker, jinhen viceroy house or sachivalayon kaa kaary saunpa gaya, unhone armbh main kaaphi sauhaard se kaary kiya, lekin baad main jhagade bhi
 Baker was given the task of planning two secretariats built next to this building
 aarmabhik yojananusaar viceroy house ko rysina kii pahari ke upar bana kar donon sachivalay neeche banane the
 Later it was decided to shift the secretariats 400 yards back and build it on the hill itself
 lootyans kii yojananusaar yah bhawan akelaa oonchai par sthit hota, jise ki sachivalayon ke kaaran apane mulyojna se peeche sarknaa padaa, saath hi aage donon sachivalay khaade ho gayi, jisase ki vah drushti main kuch dab gaya
 This was the reason for their dispute
 is mahal ke purna hone par lootyans ne baker se acchhee ladaai kii, kyonki yakeenan viceroy house kaa drishy, sadak ke ucch kone ke kaaran baadhit ho gaya tha
 Lutyens considered the controversy to be Bakerloo's level
 lekin bharpoor prayaas ke baavjood ise badalawa nahin paaya
 He wanted the road to come down from the building to a long slope, so that the view of the building is not obstructed, and the view from far away
 san 1914 main baker or lootyans sahit bani ek samiti man tay hua, ki sadak kii dhaal 25 main 1 ho, jo baad main keval 22 main 1 bani
 a more steep gradient would further disrupt the view of the building
 lootyans yah jaanata tha, ki yah dhaal bhi iske drishy ko purnataya nahin dikhaa paayegi
 Then he requested to reduce it
 san 1916 main imperial dilli samiti ne lootyans ke is prastaav ko radd kar diya
 Lutyens still understood that Baker was more involved in appeasing the government and making money, rather than focusing on a good-grade architectural design
 lootyans ne bharat or england kii baaise varshon main lagbhag prativarsh yatra kii, donon sthanon kii viceroy imaarat banane hetu
 He also had to reduce the size of the building several times due to the budget control of Lord Hardinge
 lord harding ne yadhyapi kharche niyantrit kar keemat ghataane ke nirdesh diye the
 However, he wanted that certain amount of wealth should be seen in the building

 Smoking is another major cause of bad breath

 Breathing cleanse only temporarily removes bad breath

 sanson kii adhikansh durgandh aapke munh se shuru hoti he
 There are many reasons for bad breath
 inamen se kuch kaaran nimnlikhit hai- Transformers, switch mode power supplies, electric motors, light bulbs, etc
 The current they take as soon as they turn on the electrical equipment can be much higher than the current they take
 is atyadhik dhara ko antarvaah dhara kehete hai
 This current flows from a few milliseconds to a few seconds which is different for different loads
 is dhara ko rokane ke liye tarah-tarah ke upaay kiye jate hai
 In addition, fuses and circuit breakers are selected with such ratings so that they do not trip even if too much current flows through them
 alag-alag upkarnon main antarvaah dhara kii utpatti kaa kaaran bhi alag-alag hota he
 For example, the reason for the inflow current in the light bulb is the extremely low resistance of the filament at low temperatures
 transformar ko chaalu karne par kuch der ke liye kor santrupt ho jaataa he jiske kaaran bahut adhik dhara bahati he
 The inverter current of the transformer also depends on which phase the AC voltage was in when turning on
 esampies main praaia: sandharitron kii teji se aaweshit hona ke kaaran antarvahi dhara kii utpatti kaa kaaran banati he
 As the DC motors turn on, much current flows due to the absence of 'back EMF' at this time
 transformar ke santrupt hone ke kaaran jo antarvaah dhara bahati he usamen disi tathaa dwitiya hormonic bahut adhik hota he
 This excessive current can cause fuses to blow up or break other safety-relay circuits
 iske alaava antarvaah dhara ke kaaran transformar kii kundaliyon main yantric gadabadi bhi aa sakati he
