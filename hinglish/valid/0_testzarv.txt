 Vatsyayan mentions the Dashavayavada Naiyayikas, proving that the tradition of Nayyayikas was pre-eminent
 astu, sutron kii rachana kaa kaal buddha dharm ke prachaar ke purv maananaa padataa he
 Controversy between Vedic, Buddhist and Jain naiyakis continued from the fifth century to the 13th century
 isse khandan mandan ke bahut se granth bane
 In the 14th century, Gangesopadhyay was the one who laid the foundation of 'navyanya'
 pracheen nyaay main prameya aadi jo solah padaarth the unamem se or sabko kinare karke keval 'pramaan' ko lekar hi baari shabdadambar khada kiya gaya
 This Navyanya was born in Mithila
 mithila se nadiya main jaakar navyanyay ne or bhi bhayankar rup dhaaran kiya
 Neither there was elementism nor power of elementality
 gautam kaa nyaay keval pramaan, tark aadi ke niyam nishchit karanevaala shaastra nahin he balki aatma, indriya, punarjanm, dukh apvarg aadi vishisht pramayon kaa vichaar karanevaala darshan he
 Gautama has contemplated sixteen substances and through his perfect knowledge has attained the category of exclusion or salvation
 solah padaarth yaa vishay main hai - pramaan, prameya, sanshay, prayojan, drushtaant, siddhant, avyav, tark, nirnay, vaad, jalp, vitanda, hetvabhaas, chal, jati or nigrahasthaan
 These subjects have been considered before an arbitrator as a statement of the latter defendant
 kisi vishay main vivaad upasthit hone par pehle iskaa nirnay aavashyak hota he ki donon vaadiyon ke koun koun pramaan maane jaayange
 Earlier 'proof' has been taken
 iske uparaant vivaad kaa vishay arthath 'prameya' kaa vichaar hua he
 Once the subject is informed, doubts will arise in the mind of the mediator about what its true nature is
 usee kaa vichaar 'sanshay' yaa 'andeh' padaarth ke ke naam se hua he
 After doubt, in the mind of the mediator, it can be thought that what is meant by the idea of this subject
 yahi 'prayojan' hua
 The plaintiff changes his point of view on the questionable subject, the same 'illustration' substance
 jis paksh ko vaadi pusht karke batalaata he vah uskaa 'siddhant' hua
 When the plaintiff's party is informed, the defendant proceeds to refute the tips of the accused which have been said
 yuktiyon kii khandit dekh vaadi phir se or yuktiyaan detaa he jinase prativaadee kii yuktiyon kaa uttar ho jaataa he
 This is what has been called 'logic'
 tark dwaara panchavyavayukt yuktiyon kaa kathan 'vaad' kaha gaya he
 If the defendant goes on answering in vain with the help of his own cleverness with the desire of victory, he is called 'jalp' by not believing the truth stand fixed by the suit or the debate
 is prakaar prativaadee kuch kaal tak to kuch acchhee yuktiyaan detaa jaayga phir ootpataang bakne lagegaa jise 'vitanda' kehete hai
 What will be given for this Vittanda will not be right, they will be 'fallacy'
 un hetuon or yuktiyon ke atirikt jaan boojhkar vaadi ko ghabaraane ke liye uske vaakyon kaa ootpataang arth karke yadi prativaadee gadabad daalana chahta he to vah uskaa 'chal' kehalaata he or yadi vyaptinirpeksh sadharmy vaidharmy aadi ke sahare apana paksh sthapit karne lagata he to vah 'jati' main aa jaataa he
 In this way, when a situation occurs in the debate that now the defendant should be stopped and then the debate is called 'nigrahsthan'
 prem kaa fal "hindi prachaarak pustkaalay" ke naam se prakaashan kaa kaam karne vaale nihalchand beri dwaara rachit pustak he

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically

 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 
 Shreemadbhagvatgeeta ka bhashya sambhavatah sanskrit ke vyakaranacharya paanini krit astadhayi se prerit hai parantu vibhinah purva ke paandulipi ke samuchit adhyan dwara vishesh arth nikala ja sakta hai

 The probability of occurrence of an event is called probability or probability
 sankhyikee, ganit, vigyaan, darshanashastra aadi kshetron main iskaa bahutayat se prayog hota he
 Probability is generally related to an event that is more likely to occur than not
 is arth main yah shakya se bhinn he
 The event is possible when there is no resistance to its occurrence
 'rvadhya mata' kaa hona na to shakya he or na sambhavya hi
 The 'golden Mountain' is not possible, but it is possible
 vaigyanik arth main sambhavyata kaa sambandh us ghatana se he jo na to nishchit he or na asambhav
 If the symbol of definite knowledge is to be considered as 'one' and 'zero' for lack of definite knowledge, then the place of probability can be determined between these '0' and '1'
 sambhavyata ke aadhaar hote hai
 Zevons considers the basis of probability subjective
 unhone vishwaas ko sambhavyata kaa aadhaar mana he
 This view is said to be faulty, because probability is related to quantity and it is not possible to express confidence in quantity
 vishwaas ko sambhavyata kaa aadhaar maananaa isliye bhi uchit nahin janchataa kyonki sambhavyata kii gananaa hoti he or yah gananaa vishwaas ke saath sambhav nahin he
 That is because the belief in something is never experienced and sometimes the trust of two people becomes different on one experience
 sambhavyata kaa sambandh aagaman se he
 Arrival is based on inspection and testing
 at: sambhavyata ko purna rup se aatmagat kahana uchit nahin, kyonki nirikshan or pareekshan vishaygat he
 Due to these above errors, some thinkers have certified the possibility as thematic
 sambhavyata anubhav par nirbhar karti he
 Experience is thematic
 anubhav ke aadhaar par hi ghatana ke hone yaa na hone main hamaara vishwaas hota he
 This belief is subjective
 at: nishkarsh yah nikalataa he ki sambhavyata kaa aadhaar anubhav or vishwaas donon hi hai
 Probability is calculated by mathematics
 ghatnaayen vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai
 Therefore, the method of calculating their probability is also different
 saral ghatana kii sambhaavna nikaalane ke liye ghatana ghatit hone kii sambhaavna kii sankhya main ghatana ke hone kii sambhaavna ko sampurna sankhya se bhaag dete hai
 This time the rule is to know the possibility of the king of black betel by pulling in 52 cards of cards
 at: kaala paan kaa badshaah nikalne kii sambhaavna 1 / 52 he
 Two events that do not happen together have to add their different probability to calculate the probability of an event occurring
 taash kii 52 pattiyon main gulam or badshaah kisi ek ke nikalne kii sambhaavna he : Similarly, the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously by multiplying their different probabilities together
 indradhanush tathaa varsha, in donon swatantra ghatnaon ke saath saath ghatit hone kii sambhaavna hogi : The same rule is also applicable with the subordinate events
 ekatrit kiye hue pramaan kii satyata kii sambhaavna ko jaanane ke liye 1 main se uski asambhaavnaaon ke gunanfal ko gata dete hai
 The probability of an event told by other witnesses to be true can be deduced as: When a testimony is 5 / 6 the probability of being true will be unlikely to be true
 phir duusari gavaahi main satya hone kii sambhaavna jab 2 / 3 he to usamen asambhaavna hogi By subtracting the product of these two different possibilities, the answer will be - is prakaar gavaahon dwaara bataai hui ghatana ke satya hone kii sambhaavna 17 / 18 hogi
 Thus the quantity of probability is calculated on the basis of number
 at: sankhya kii gananaa purna rup se nahin hone par sambhavyata kii maatra nishchit nahin kii ja sakati
 The conclusion that is obtained after calculating the probability is true only for the average
 duusare shabdon main yah kahen ki sambhavyata ausat ke liye satya hoti he

 Therefore, he directed Colonel Bor to send the army to Konkan, and in return, called for troops from Shirur if necessary

 sar jon strechi ne bharat ke vibhinnataaon ke vishay me kaha he ki "bharatvarsh ke vishay main sarvapratham mahatvapurn jaanane yogya baat yah he ki bharatvarsh na kabhi raashtra tha, or na he, or na usamen europea vichaaron ke anusaar kisi prakaar kii bhugolic, rajnatik, saamaajik athwa dharmik ekta thi, na koi bhartiya raashtra or na koi bhartiya hi tha jiske vishay main ham bahut adhik sunate hai
 "in this connection, Sir John Shille states that" The idea that India is a nation is based on the root which political science does not accept and tries to overcome
 bharatvarsh ek raajnneetik naam nahi hai varan ek bhugolic naam he jis prakaar europe yaa africa
 " uparokt vichaaron se spasht ho jaataa he ki bharat main rashtrawaad kaa udai or vikaas un paristhitiyon main hua jo rashtrawaad ke maarg main sahaayta pradaan karne ke sthaan par baadhaayen paidaa karti he
 The reality is that fundamental unity has always existed among the variations of Indian society and from time to time, the sense of political unity has also been rising
 ve0e0 smith ke shabdon main "vastav me bharatvarsh kii ekta uski vibhinnataaon main hi nihit he
 "the establishment of British rule has given birth to new ideas and new systems in Indian society
 As a result of the actions and reactions between these ideas and systems gave birth to national ideas in India
 bhartiya rashtrawaad ko samajhane ke liye uski saamaajik prishthbhumi ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 Before the arrival of the British in India, Indian villages were self-sufficient communities
 ve chote-chote ganraajyon ke samaan the jo prayek baat main aatmanirbhar the
 In pre-british India, the rural economy was based on agriculture and cottage industries and had been living for centuries
 krishi or udyog main takneekee str atyant nimna tha
 In the social sector, families, caste panchayats and rural panchayats used to act as social control
 nagareey kshetra main kuch nagar rajnatik, kuch dharmik tathaa kuch vyapaar kii drushti se mahatvapurn thi
 Most states had their capital in one or the other city
 nagaron main adhiktar laghu udyog prachlit the
 These industries received state aid
 adhiktar gaanvon or nagaron main paraspar saanskrithik aadan-pradaan bahut kam hota tha, kyonki yatayaat or sandeshvaahan ke saadhan bahut kam viksit the
 Thus political changes had little impact on the social status of the village
 vibhinn graamon or nagaron ke ek duusare se alag-alag rahane ke kaaran desh main kabhi akhil bhartiya raashtra kii bhaavana utpann nahin ho saki
 Whatever nationalism was felt in India, it was mostly a sense of religious and idealistic unity, not a sense of political and economic unity
 log tirthayatra karne ke liye purv se pashchim or uttar se dakshin bharat kaa daura avashya karte the or isse desh kii dharmik ekta kii bhaavana bani hui thi, kintu sampoorn desh paraspar sangharshrat chote-chote rajyon main banta hua tha, jiname baraabar yuddh hote rahete the
 On the other hand, rural societies were almost untouched by these political changes
 bhartiya samskruti mukhyarup se dharmik rahi he
 In this, political and economic values were never given as much importance as is given in modern culture
 bhartiya samskruti kii ekta bhi dharmik adarshavaadi ekta he
 Most of the lack of national feeling is visible in it
 bharat main angrejon kii vijay ke pashchaat bhartiya samaaj main vyapak roopaantaran hua
 The reason for the establishment of the British Empire was the decline of the Mughal Empire and the partition of the country into many small states
 british shashan purv-muslim shasno se anek baton main bhinn tha
 The British had a greater sense of nationality, discipline, patriotism and cooperation than the Indian people
 unke in gunon ne bhartiya vishisht varg ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 British rule had far-reaching effects on India's economic structure
 usase ek or desh main pracheen asin samaaj ko aghat pahunchaa or duusari ore paashchaatya samaaj kii sthapana hui
 This created political unity in the country
 uske prabhaav se desh main rashtriyata ke aandolan kaa vikaas hua
 This led to a complete change in the country's agricultural system
 angrejon ke aane se pehle bhoomi raja kii nahin samajhi jaati thi
 Used to tax the king who plowed it, the land of Astu was not even considered as private property
 angrejon ke aane se bhoomi par gramin samudaay kaa adhikaar nahin rahaa, balki vah vyaktiyon kii nijee sampatti ban gai
 In this way, in some parts of the country, landlords and farmers in other parts got the right to the land
 lard cornwalis ke rajyakaal main, bengal, bihar or urisa main jameendaar varg kaa udai hua
 This led to remote changes in the rural economy
 desh ke anya bhaagon main raiyatwari prabandh se kisaanon ko unke dwaara joti gai bhoomi par adhikaar de diya gaya
 Sir Tomas started the Ryotwadi system in 1820 as the Governor of Madras
 isse desh me vyapak, saamaajik, rajnatik saanskrithik or manovaigyanik parivartan hue
 In the new system of paying rent, not the rural panchayat, but the zamindars and farmers started paying taxes directly to the government
 is prakaar krishi vyavastha vyapaar kii sthiti main aa gai or paramparaagat bhartiya gramin vyavastha kaa vighatan hua
 The transformation of the agricultural system started progressively
 bhoomi par nijee adhikaar sthapit hone se bhoomi ke chote-chote tukade badhane lage
 Farming was adversely affected by this erosion
 lagaan vasuul karne kii nai pranali se sarkari karmchaariyon ke naveen varg kaa nirmaan hua
 Those who have far-reaching political significance
 desh kii aarthik dasha bigadane lagi, garibi badhane lagi
 In the villages, debt began to increase on the people, due to which the land gradually came out of the hands of the cultivators and went into the hands of the non-cultivators
 isse bhu-daason ke ek naveen varg kaa nirmaan hua, jiske hit bhu-swaamiyon ke hit ke viruddh the
 In the field of agriculture, proletarian land-slaves were formed on the one hand and altruistic zamindar class on the other side, in which mutual conflict and tension increased
 in virgon ke nirmaan se vyapak, saamaajik aarthik or rajnatik parivartan hue
 There were also extensive changes in the urban economy during the British rule
 kutir udyogon ko dhakka laga
 Their interests under foreign rule were disgraced, their consumption of goods decreased, leading to the end of traditional industries
 kaarigaron kaa saamaajik str girane laga or kaarigiri ke kaam chhodkar anya vyavsaayon lagane lage
 The consumption of indigenous goods started decreasing in the competition of ready-made goods from abroad, as a result of which India became the source of producing most of the raw materials and the markets of the country started to be filled with foreign goods
 is prishthbhumi desh main aadhunik udyogon ke vikaas me atyadhik mahatva he
 The British increased the means of transport and conveyance in the country for their benefit
 unhone naye-naye udyogon kii sthapana kii
 All this gradually aided in the development of a sense of nationality
 angreji padhe naye logo ne angrejon kii aarthik niti kii katu aalochana kii
 The capitalist class started to grow with the development of industries in the country
 adhiktar bhartiya udyogon main videshi poonji lagi hui thi
 Thus the economy of the country was harmful to the country and beneficial to the British, on the other hand their monopoly in the field of trade and industry increased
 angrejon ne desh main ek aise varg ke nirmaan ke liye angreji shiksha kaa prachaar kiya jo ki unhen shashan main sahaayta de saken
 Much of the education in pre-british India was religious education, which was imparted through Sanskrit schools and Muslim madrasas
 isaiyon ne desh main aadhunik shiksha kaa prachaar kiya, yadhyapi unki shiksha kaa ek uddeshy desh main isaiyon kii sankhya badhanaa bhi tha, kintu usase pashchimi tathaa aadhunikeekaran kii prakriyaaon ko bhi protsaahan mila
 In addition to general education, the British also opened schools to impart vocational education
 paashchaatya shiksha ke prabhaav se desh me ek aise vishisht varg kaa nirmaan hua jisane rashtriya shiksha kii ore dhyaan diya
 This class was well aware of the importance of education
 brahm samaaj, arya samaaj, ramakrishna mishan, aligarh aandolan ne bhi shiksha ko protsaahit kiya
 Kashi Hindu University and Muslim University were established in Aligarh
 desh main anek jagah dayanand aglo-vaidic vidyalayon or kalejon kii sthapana hui
 On the one hand, with the spread of English education, there was a rise of the class of black British who were Indian only by birth and in all respects, on the other hand, such educated classes were also created which were proud of the ancient traditions of the country
 inhen logon ne desh main rashtriya aandolan kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Whatever the criticism of the English education system in India, it is certain that it led to the national movement in the country
 usase rashtriyata, janatantravaad or samaajwaad kii lahar utpann hui
 Prior to the British, there was a complete lack of fundamental, political and administrative unity in India
 angrejon ne samast desh main rajnatik or prashasnic drushti se saamaanya vyavastha sthapit kii thi unhone apane rajya main kanoon ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 These laws were applied to every citizen of the state and to enforce them a complex judicial system was created in the country, the judges appointed by the state interpreted the laws
 or rajya ke adhiniyamon ko nagarikon par lagu karte the
 Lower courts, high courts and federal courts and councils were established all over the country
 jisaki apil privi council main kii ja sakati thi
 Thus the laws became more definite rather than based on customs
 kanoon kaa rajya sthapit hone se sthaneey panchayaton ke adhikaar kam ho gaye tathaa nyaay-vyavastha main ekarupata kii sthapana hui
 There is a huge difference in India and the English state legal system before the arrival of the British
 While the pre-british law was mostly based on religious motifs, the British law was based on the Act and democratic values of discrimination of caste class, species class, gender
 Every citizen without state had equal rights
 is prakaar british shashan kaal main bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar desh kii janata main janatantreey aadhaar par ekta sthapit hui
 Apart from legal unity, administrative unity was also established in the British rule, in the city in which the administrative system of the province was one of a kind in the whole country
 lagaan kii vyavastha main vyapak parivartan hone se desh main bhoomi sambandhi kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana hui, jisamen bhoomi kray-vikray or rahan-sahan ke sambandh main samast desh main ek se kanoonon kaa prasar hua
 In the economic sector, the British government spread the coin from all over the country, in which there was an unprecedented increase in trade and purchase
 angrejon ke shasankaal main naveen saamaajik or aarthik vyavastha tathaa naveen prashasnic pranali or nai shiksha ke vistaar se nae virgon kaa udai hua
 These classes were not found in ancient Indian society
 ye angreji shasankaal main poonjivadi vyavastha se utpann hue
 But these new classes did not rise in the same way in different parts of the country
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main ek hi saath angreji shashan kii sthapana nahin hui or na unamem ek hi saath sudhaar lagu kiye gaye
 First the British rule was established in Bengal and from there the first landlord class was born
 isi prakaar bengal tathaa bombay main sabase pehle bade udyogon kii sthapana kii gai or vahaan par udyogpatiyon or shramikon ke virgon kaa nirmaan hua, ant main jab sampoorn desh me angreji shashan kii sthapana hui to sab jagah rashtriya str par nae saamaajik varg dikhalaai padane lage
 The former British social and economic structure had an important contribution in the creation of these new classes
 udhaaharan ke liye angrejon ke aane ke pehle baniyon main vyapaar or udyog adhik tha or angreji shasankaal main bhi inhen logon ne sabase pehle poonjipati varg kaa nirmaan kiya, hinduon kii tulana main muslim jansankhya me shiksha kaa prasar kam hone ke kaaran uname buddhijivi, madhyamvarg or burjua varg hindu samudaayon kii tulana main bahut baad main dikhalaai diya
 Thus, during the British rule, the zamindar class, land plowing, landlord, agricultural laborer, merchant class, moneylender, capitalist class, middle class, small merchant and shopkeeper class, doctors, lawyers, professors, managers, clerks, businessmen and so on
 The working class in various factories and gardens emerged
 inamen se anek virgon ke hit paraspar viruddh the or unhone apane-apane hiton kii raksha karne ke liye anek naveen aandolan chede
 The sprout of nationalist ideology began to grow in India from the middle of the seventeenth century, but it continued to develop slowly and finally it was completed in 1857 AD

 The national movement that started in India due to the birth of nationalism was a unique movement in the world itself, along with political awakening in India, social and religious awakening was also initiated
 vastav me saamaajik tathaa dharmik jagriti ke parinamswaroop rajanithik jagriti kaa udai hua
 Dr
 Zakaria is of the view that "india's renaissance was primarily spiritual
 isane raashtra ke raajnneetik uddhaar ke aandolan kaa rup dhaaran karne se bahut pehle anek dharmik or saamaajik sudhaaron kaa sutarapaat kiya
 “the Indian national awakening in this way is different from the national awakening in European countries

 While these movements tried to remove the evils prevailing in another religion and society, on the other hand, India played an important role in preparing the land of nationalism

 Raja Rammohan Roy demanded political rights for Indians

 After 1707 AD, political unity had disappeared in India, but at the time of the British, the administration of almost the whole of India came under a central authority

 Western education made a commendable contribution to the Indian national stream
 1825 i0 me lard maikale ke suzav par bharat me shiksha kaa madhyam angreji bhashaa ko nishchit kiya
 Its main objective was to destroy the national consciousness of India at the root
 rajani palm dutt ne sahi likhaa he, "bharat main british shashan dwaara paashchaatya shiksha prarambh kiye jane kaa uddeshy yah tha ki bhartiya sabhyataa or samskruti kaa purnroop se lop ho jaae or ek aise varg kaa nirmaan ho jo rakt or varna se to bhartiya hon, kintu ruchi vichaar shabd or buddhi se angrej ho jaae
 "the British were also successful to this extent to a great extent, as educated Indians, forgetting their culture, started praising Western culture

 This awakened the national consciousness in India, so western education proved to be a boon for India

 Indian literature and newspapers were also instrumental in the progress and development of the national movement

 The British government's policy of economic exploitation had completely destroyed Indian industries
 yahan ke vyapaar par angrejon kaa purna adhikaar ho gaya tha
 Indian goods, which went out, were heavily taxed and the British government gave a great discount on imports for goods coming into India
 iske atirikt angrej bharat se kaccha maal le jate the, england se mashiinon dwaara nirmit maal bharat main bhejte the, jo laghu evam kutir udyog dhandhon ke nirmit maal se bahut sasta hota tha
 As a result, Indian markets were filled with European goods and due to the collapse of cottage industry businesses, millions of people became unemployed

 Therefore, in 1880, Sir William Digvi wrote that there are about ten million human beings in British India, who do not get any food at any time, the second example of this degeneration can not be seen anywhere else in a more prosperous country at this time
 Regarding the economic condition of Indians, the Duke of Agali, who was the Secretary of India in 1875

 chaar karod bharatiyon ko keval din main khaanaa khaakar santusht rahanaa padataa tha
 The only reason for this was that England also used to receive taxes from hungry farmers and made profit by sending their goods there

 She wanted to be free from this exploitation
 isliye bharatiyon ne rashtriya aandolan main sakriyarup se bhaag lenaa prarambh kar diya
 In the words of Gurmukh Nihal Singh “the fact that the deteriorating economic condition and the anti-national economic policy of the government had a lot of hand in awakening anti-british ideology and national sentiment
 “ After the revolt of 1857, the British rulers adopted the policy of caste differentiation
 is niti ke anusaar ve bharatiyon ko ghrinaa kii drushti se dekhne lage
 According to Gurmukh Nihal Singh, “the British who came to India after the rebellion had different perceptions about Indians
 ve manch ke tatkaaleen daasya chitron ke anusaar bharatiyon ko aisa jantu samajhate the jo aadha vanamaanush or aadha nigro tha, jise keval bhay dwaara hi samajhaayaa ja saktaa tha or jiske liye jaranal nil tathaa uske saathiyon kaa ghrinaa or aatank kaa vyavhaar hi upyukt tha
 " 1857 ke vidroh ke baad angrejon ne sampark kam kar diya

 In hotels, clubs, parks etc
, the British used to mistreat Indians
 is kaaran angrejon ne rang bhed kii niti ke aadhaar par bharatiyon par anek atyaachaar kiye
 Garrett wrote in this regard, "the caste differentiation policy of Europeans was based on three important principles

 The British killed many Indians, but they were not punished
 is sambandh main morrisan ne likhaa he, "yah ek mahasatya he jise chipaaya nahin ja saktaa ki angrejon dwaara bharatiyon kii hatya kii jane kii ghatana ek-do nahin he
 One issue of Amrit Bazar Patrika mentions three incidents in which the killers did not get full legal punishment

 The arrogance of being the winning caste is highest among them, their moral sense does not allow that an Englishman has to give his life in the crime of killing an Indian
 " This caste discrimination policy of the British had a very bad effect on Indians

 This fact communicated the feeling of nationalism at a rapid pace

 But this bill became a fierce controversy

 As a result, the British all over India and England organized and opposed it and launched a movement against it
 unhone kaha, “kaale log goron ko lambi-lambi sajaayen denge tathaa unki striyon ko apane ghar main rakhenge
 "the Europeans set up a 'european Defense Association' to collectively launch a movement against this bill and collected about one lakh fifty thousand rupees

 In the words of Sir Henry Cotton, "the European Movement opposed to this Bill provided as much unity to the national ideology of India as the Bill could not have passed
" ” europiyanon ke aandolan se prabhavit hokar bharatiyon ne bhi rashtriya sanstha ke gathan kaa nishchay kiya
 As a result, the way for the establishment of Congress was paved
 bharatiyon ne mahasoos kiya ki yadi ham bhi angrejon kii bhanti sangathit hokar british sarkaar kaa virodh karen, to hame swadhinata praapt ho sakati he
 This gave a boost to the national movement
 shri e si majumdaar likhte hai, “is aandolan ne bharatiyon ko yah bhi anubhav kara diya ki yadi raajnneetik pragati vaanchhneeya he, to keval ek rashtriya sabha dwaara hi sambhav he
 This gathering should not be related to the independent politics of the different provinces but to a broader politics of the country
 ” Analyzing the reasons for the birth of nationalism, it becomes clear that it was born in India as a result of the policies of the British government

 Informally, this means that an irrational number cannot be represented as a simple fraction
 udhaaharan ke liye 2 kaa vargamul, or pai aparimey sankhyaayein hai
 It can be proved that irrational numbers are typically real numbers that cannot be represented as terminals or continuous decimals, although mathematicians do not take this as a definition

 Perhaps, the most well known irrational numbers are π, e and √2
when the ratio of the length of two line segments is irrational, the line segments are also described as incommensurable, they do not share any measure in common
 In this sense the measure of a line segment l is a line segment j whose "measure" is l in the sense that the number of all copies of j from one end to the other end achieves the same length as l

 Theodorus of Siren proves the irrationality of the radicals up to 17, but stayed there probably because the algebra he used could not be applied to the square root of 17
 And when Eudoxus developed the theory of proportions In which irrational as well as rational ratios were taken care of, then only a strong mathematical foundation of irrational numbers was created
 a magnitude "was not a number, but was for existence such as line segment, angle, area, volume and time which we can say can be continuously varied

 Because no quantitative values were assigned to the magnitude, Eudoxus was able to compute both proportions and incommensurable ratios, for which he assigned a ratio as an equivalence between the two ratios in terms of its magnitude and proportionality

 The following argument appeals twice to the fact that the square of an odd integer is always odd
 yadi √2 parimey he, to purnank m,n ke liye iskaa rup m / n he, jahaan donon sam nahin hai
 Then m 2 = 2n 2, so m is even, say m = 2p
 Thus 4p 2 = 2n 2 therefore 2p 2 = n 2 so n is even, which is a contradiction

 maan lijiye ki log2 3 parimey he
 For some positive integers m and n, we have iskaa matlab he ki However, the number 2 that is raised to any positive integer power must be even and the number 3 that is raised to any positive integer power must be odd
 Obviously, an integer cannot be both even and odd at the same time: we have a contradiction
 jo ekmaatr anumaan hamane lagaaya tha vah tha ki log2 3 parimey he 
 virodhabhas kaa matlab he ki yah dharna zarur galat hogi, yani log2 3 aparimey he or ise kabhi bhi purnank m / n ke ek bhagfal ke rup main vyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa he jahaan n ≠ 0 he
 Cases like log10 2 can also be treated in a similar way

 Because algebraic numbers constitute a region, many irrational numbers can be constructed by combining algebraic and transcendental numbers
 udhaaharan ke liye 3π + 2, π + √2 or e √3 aparimey hai 
 The decimal expansion of an irrational number never repeats or ends unlike a rational number
 yah darshane ke liye, maan lijiye ham n purnank ko m dwaara bhaag dete hai 
 jab m dwaara n ke bhaag par deergh bhaag ko lagu kiya jaataa he, to keval m sheshfal sambhav hote hai
 If 0 appears as a remainder, the decimal expansion ends
 yadi 0 kabhi prakat nahin hota to vah elgorithm, kisi bhi sheshfal ko ek baar se adhik upyog naa karte hue adhik se adhik m - 1 charan chal saktaa he
 After that, a remainder must recur and then the decimal expansion repeats
 iske vipareet, maan lijiye hamaare saamne ek aavarti dashamalav aata he, to ham siddh kar sakate hai ki vah do purnankon kaa bhinn he
 for example: yahaan repitend kii lambaai 3 he
 We multiply by 103: dhyaan den ki jab hamane 10 ke ghaate dohraye jane vaale bhaag kii lambaai se guna kiya, to hamane ankon ko dashamalav bindu ke bain ore thik utane hi sthanon se sthanantarit kiya
 Therefore, the back end of 1000A exactly matches the back end of A
 yahaan, donon 1000A or a ke sire main 162 doharaav he
 Therefore, when we subtract a from both sides, the back end of 1000A cancels out from the rear end of A: phir 
 Alternatively, since 0
5 = 1 / 2, a person can clear the fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2: 
 The last line, 53 / 74, is a quotient of integers and is therefore a rational number
 yahaan ek prasiddh shuddh astitv yaa gaiyr-rachanaatmak pramaan he: There exist two irrational numbers a and b, such that ab is rational

 anyathaa, maan lijiye ki a aparimey sankhya √2√2 he or b = √2
 to phir a b = √2 = 2√2·√2 = √22 =2 jo parimey he
 Although the above argument does not decide between the two cases, the Gelfond – Schneider theorem implies that √2√2 is transcendental, hence irrational
 yah gyaat nahin he ki kya π + e athwa π - e aparimey he yaa nahin
 In fact, there is no pair of non-zero integers m and n about which m π + ne is irrational or not
