 These protect the rotating muscle phlegm from the achromatic arch
 kandhe ke saamaanya or pathologic kaary ko samajhane ke liye glenohyumaral jod ke bal kii jaankaree hona aavashyak he
 This forms the basis of surgery to treat the fracture and replace the joint, to optimize and stabilize the implantation and to design and improve the shoulder's analytic and biochemical models
 In the Julius Wolfe Institute, the mechanical force of the joint can be measured by the force and motion of the joint within the living tissue during different activities

 The following sentences are statements, because they all contain claims that are either true or false: nimnlikhit vaakya taarkik drushti se kathan nahin hai: In these nonsensical examples, the third sentence is not a statement because there is no king of Haryana - that is, the claim of this sentence is meaningless and there is no question of its being true / untrue

 Panchatantra is considered the first place in Sanskrit fables
 yadhyapi yah pustak apane mul rup main nahin rah gayi he, phir bhi uplabdh anuwaadon ke aadhaar par isaki rachana teesri shatabdi isa purv ke aas- paas nirdhaarit kii gai he
 The author of this book is Pt
 Vishnu Sharma
 uplabdh pramaanon ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki jab is granth kii rachana puri hui, tab unki umr lagbhag 80 varsh thi
 Panchatantra is divided into five mechanisms: manovigyaan, vyavhaarikta tathaa rajkaaj ke siddhanton se parichit karaati ye kahaniyaan sabhi vishyon ko bade hi rochak tareeke se saamne rakhti he tathaa saath hi saath ek sikh dene kii koshish karti he
 In many stories of Panchatantra, in addition to human characters, many times animals and birds have also been made characters of the story and an attempt has been made to say many instructive things to them
 panchatantra kii kahaniyaan bahut jeevant hai
 In them, public behavior is explained in a very simple way
 bahut se log is pustak ko netritv kshamta viksit karne kaa ek shashakt madhyam maanate hai
 The importance of this book is propounded by the fact that it has been translated into almost every language of the world
 nitikthaon main panchatantr kaa pehla sthaan he
 The Panchatantra is the basis of the composition of the interests
 swayan narayan pandit ji ne sweekaar kiya he- Its composition is set around the third century, based on the various available translations
 panchatantra kii rachana kis kaal main hui, yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki panchatantra kii mul prati abhi tak uplabdh nahin he
 Some scholars have presented their views about the author of Panchatantra and its creation period in the language style of Panchatantra
 mahamahopadhyaay pan sadashiv shastri ke anusaar panchatantra ke rachayita vishnusharma the or vishnusharma chanakya kaa hi doosraa naam tha
 Therefore, the Panchatantra was composed during the time of Chandragupta Maurya and its composition period was 300 BC
 may be considered
 par paashchaatya tathaa kuch bhartiya vidvan aisa nahin maanate, unka kathan he ki chanakya kaa doosraa naam vishnugupt tha vishnusharma nahin, tathaa uplabdh panchatantra kii bhashaa kii drushti se to yah guptakaleen rachana prathit hoti he
 Mahamahopadhyaya Pt Durgaprasad Sharma has considered the time of Vishnusarma in the middle of the Ashtamashakta because the first system of Panchatantra saw the Arya Arya of Kuttinimat composed by Damodar Gupta of the eighth century A
D
 Must have occurred in parantu keval ukt shloke ke adhar par panchatantra kii rachana ashtum shatak main nahin maani ja sakati, kyonki yah shloke kisi sanskaran main prakshipt bhi ho saktaa he
 Hertel and Dr
 Keith, its composition 200 BC Is in favor of obeying
 chanakya ke arthshaastra kaa prabhaav bhi panchatantra main dikhaai detaa he iske adhar par bhi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki chanakya kaa samay lagbhag chaturth shatabdi purv kaa he atah panchatantra kii rachana teesri shatabdi ke purv hui hogi
 Thus, none of the views regarding the creation of Panchatantra is completely unanimous
 sanskaran-panchatantra ke chaar sanskaran uplabdh he- The first edition is the Pahlavi translation of the original text, which is now received in the form of Syrian and Arabic translations
 dwitiya sanskaran ke rup main panchatantra gunadhyakrut ‘brihatkatha’ main dikhaai padataa he
 'brihatkatha' was composed in the Paisachi language but its original form has been destroyed and the Kshemarikrit 'brihatkatha Manjari' and 'kathasaritsagar' written by Somdev are translations of the same
 tritiy sanskaran main tantrakhyayika evam usase sambaddh jain kathaon kaa sangrah he
 'tantrayakhya' is considered to be the most ancient
 iskaa mul sthaan kashmir he
 The famous German scholar Dr
 Hertel discovered the authentic version with great exertion
 inke anusaar ‘tantrakhyayika’ yaa tantrakhya hi panchatantra kaa mularoop he
 This is the prevalent 'panchatantra' of the modern era
 chaturth sanskaran dakshini ‘panchatantra’ kaa mularoop he tathaa iskaa pratinidhitiv nepali ‘panchatantra’ evam ‘hitopadesh’ karte hai
 Thus 'panchatantra' is a representative of a huge literature rather than a book
 vishwa-sahitya main bhi panchatantra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 It has been translated into many foreign languages
 in anuwaadon main pahalavi bhashaa kaa ‘kartakadamanak’ naam kaa anuwaad hi sabase pracheen anuwaad mana jaataa he
 According to Winternitz, the greater influence of Panchatantra is seen on German literature
 isi prakaar greek kii isap kii kahaniyon kaa tathaa arab kii 'arebian nits' aadi kathaon kaa aadhaar panchatantra hi he
 It is believed that the Panchatantra has been translated into about 50 diverse languages so far and there have been about 200 versions of it
 yahi isaki lokapriyata kaa parichaayak he
 There are five tantras or divisions in the Panchatantra
 vibhaag ko tantra isliye kaha gaya he kyonki inamen naitiktapurna shashan kii vidhiyaan bataayin gayin hai
 These systems are friendly, friendly, attaining Kakolukiyam, beneficial and obtrusive
 sankshep main in tantron kii vishaywastu is prakaar he- There is a main story in the fables and there are many minor stories to corroborate it
 Similarly, in this first system called 'mitradhabha', the story of Amarashakti, the king of Mahilaropya in the south of Angikatha, is told that he is his The reason for the foolish sons was anxious and hence they entrust a scholar named Vishnusharma to educate their sons and Vishnusharma was given to them
 They are successful in educating through stories in the month itself
 tatpashchaat mitrabhed naamak bhaag kii angi-katha main, ek dusht siyaar dwaara pingalak naamak singh ke saath sanjeevak naamak bail kii shatruta utpann karaane kaa varnan he jise singh ne aapatti se bachaaya tha or apane do mantriyon- karkat or damanak ke virodh karne par bhi use apana mitra bana liya tha
 Many types of teachings have been given in this system, such that a person can face even the most difficult situation with patience, so one should not give up patience even if destiny worsens
 is tantra main mitra kii prapti se kitna sukh evam anandaprapt hota he vah kapotraj chitragriv kii katha ke madhyam se bataaya gaya he
 Only friend helps in disaster- aisa kaha gaya he ki mitra kaa ghar main aana swarg se bhi adhik sukh ko detaa he
 Thus, the precept of this system is that only useful friends should be made, as the crow, turtle, deer and rat remain happy on the strength of friendship
 isamen yuddh or sandhi kaa varnan karte hue ulluon kii guha ko kauon dwaara jala dene kii katha kahi gayi he
 It states that for self-realization, the enemy should also be made a friend and later be seen and destroyed
 is tantra main bhi kaua ullu se mitrataa kar letaa he or baad main ullu ke kile main aag lagava detaa he
 Therefore, you should stay safe from enemies because a person who falls in laziness and ignores enemies and disease - does not try to stop him, he is killed by the same - is tantra main vanar or magaramchh kii mukhya katha he or anya avaantar kathaayen hai
 It has been told in these stories that how was the achievement of the desired, that is, that it was destroyed
 isamen vanar or magaramchh kii katha ke madhyam se shiksha di gai he ki budhimaan apane buddhible se jeet jaataa he or murkh haath main ai hui vastu se bhi vanchit rah jaataa he
 Particularly in this last system of Panchatantra, emphasis has been laid on the policy of doing well thought out work because a person who does a work without thinking well and listening well does not get success in the work but many difficulties in life Have to face
 atah andhanukaran nahin karnaa chahie
 In the main story of this system, there is a story of a blindfolded hairdresser who was executed by the judges on the guilt of slaying the Jain-sannyas, following the Seth named Manibhadra
 atah bina pariksha kiye hue nai ke samaan anuchit kaary nahin karnaa chahie- It also states that no action should be done even without full knowledge because later one has to repent as if a Brahmin wife killed a blood-soaked mongoose without looking at it thinking that it had eaten my son
 So to protect the child from the snake, the snake was killed, due to which its face was stained with blood
 isliye kaha gaya- Thus, Panchatantra is a didactic work
 isamen lekhakane apni vyavhaar kushalta rajnatikpatutaa evam gyaan kaa parichay diya he
 Non-human characters of ethics are often of two types, living beings and unconscious matter
 panchatantra main bhi ye do prakaar ke paatr dekhe jate hai- pashuon main singh, vyaghr, shrigal, shashak, vrishabh, gadhaa, aadi, pakshiyon main kaak, uluk, kapot, mayur, chatak, shuk aadi tathaa itar praaniyon main sarp, nakul, pipilika aadi
 Apart from these, the river, sea, tree, mountain, cavity etc
 are also unconscious characters, which have been accused of human behavior
 panchatantra main maanav ko vyavhaar kushal banane kaa prayaas atyadhik saral evam rochak style main kiya gaya he
 Explaining the purpose of Panchatantra, Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has written that- hyderabad express 7027 bhartiya rail dwaara sanchalit ek mail express train he
 The train leaves from Trivandrum Central Railway Station at 07:00 AM and arrives at Hyderabad Deccan Railway Station at 01:40 PM

 jaraasandh mahabharat kaaleen magadh rajya kaa naresh tha
 He was a very powerful king and his dream was to become the Chakravati emperor
 yadhyapi vah ek shaktishaalee raja to tha, lekin vah tha bahut krur
 In order to fulfill his dream that he was invincible, he kept many kings captive in his prison
 vah mathura ke yaduwanshi naresh kansa kaa sasur evam param mitra tha uski dono putriyo asit evm praapit kaa vivaah kansa se hua tha
 He marched Mathura 17 times to take vengeance of Kansa slaughter from Sri Krishna but every time he had to fail
 jaraasandh shri krishna kaa param shatru or ek yoddha tha
 Jarasandha's father was Magadhanaresh Maharaj Brihadratha and he had two daughters
 vah dono hi ko ekasmaan chaahate the
 a lot of time passed and he was growing old, but he had no children
 tab ek baar unhone suna kii unke rajya main rishi chandkowshik padhaare hue hai or ve ek aam ke vriksh ke neeche virajman hai
 On hearing this, Rajan became hopeful and went to meet the sage
 rishi ke paas pahunch kar unhone rishi ko apana dukh kah sunaaya
 On hearing the account of the king, the sage felt pity and gave a mango to the king and asked him to feed it to his queen
 lekin chunki unki do patniyaan thi or ve dono hi se ek samaan prem karte the, isliye unhone us aam ke baraabar tukade karke apni dono raniyon ko khilaa diya
 This gave half-sons to both queens
 bhay ke maare unhone un dono tukdo ko van main phikvaa diya
 Then a demon named Zara was also going from there
 usne maans ke un donon lothdon ko dekha or usne daayan lothada daaen haath main or baayan lothada baayen haath main liya jisase vah dono tukde jud gaye
 As soon as he joined, the child roared very loudly, which frightened the little demon and ran away from the chest of both the queens in the palace
 isiilie uskaa naam jaraasandh hua
 Thus Jarasandha was born
 indraprastha nagari kaa nirmaan puraa hone ke pashchaat ek din naarad muni ne maharaj yudhisthir ko unke pita kaa yah sandesh sunaaya kii ab ve rajasuya yajna karen
 When Maharaj spoke to Shri Krishna on this subject, he also encouraged Yudhishthira to perform the Rajasuya Yajna, but there was only one obstacle in the path of Maharaj Yudhishthira becoming Chakravarti Emperor, Magadha Naresh Jarasandha, without which he could not become emperor
 Were nor could it be defeated in the battlefield
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye shrikrishna, bhim or arjuna ke saath brahmanon kaa bhesh banaakar magadh kii ore chal die
 After reaching there, Jarasandha considered him a Brahmin and asked him to ask for something, but at that time the Brahmin disguised Srikrishna said that now both of his friends have a silent fast which will end at half-night
 tab jaraasandh ne ardh raatri tab hi aane kaa vachan diya or unhen brahman kaksh me tehraaya
 Then at midnight he came but he had some doubts on the three that they are not Brahmins as they looked like Kshatriyas from the body, they revealed their doubts and asked them to come in their real form and recognized them
 tab shrikrishna kii khari-khoti sunne ke baad use krodh aa gaya or usne kaha kii unhen jo bhi chahie ve maang le or yahan se chale jaaen
 Then he asked to wrestle Jarasandha in Brahmin disguise itself and then gave his real introduction
 jaraasamgh ek vir yodha tha isliye usne mall yuddh ke liye bhim ko hi chunaa
 Then next he fought Malla in Mallabhoomi with Bhima
 yah yuddh lagbhag 28 dino tak chalata rahaa lekin jitani baar bhimsen uske do tukade karte vah phir se jud jaataa
 At this, Shri Krishna indicated to Bhima with the help of a stem of grass that this time he sliced it and threw both the pieces in different directions
 tab bhim ne vaisaa hi kiya or is prakaar jaraasandh kaa vadh hua
 Then by killing him, the three freed all the 86 kings locked in his prison and Sri Krishna made Jarasandh's son Sahadeva king
 sahadev ne aage chalakar ke mahabharat ke yudh me pandwo kaa saath diya
 Vande Mataram bankimachandra chattopadhyaay dwaara sanskrit bangla mishrit bhashaa main rachit is geet kaa prakaashan san 1882 main unke upanyaas anand math main anternihit geet ke rup main hua tha
 In this novel, this song is sung by a monk named Bhawanand
 isaki dhun yadunath bhattacharya ne banaayi thi
 In 2003, in an international survey conducted by BBC World Service, in which around 7,000 songs were selected from around the world to select the ten most famous songs of the time, and according to BBC, people from 155 countries / islands had it
 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 dow nareshchandra sengupt ne san 1906 main Abbey of Bliss ke naam se iskaa angreji-anuwaad prakashit kiya
 Arvind Ghosh translated the song 'vande Mataram' described in 'anandamath' into English prose and poetry
 maharishi aravind dwaara kiye gayi angreji gadhy-anuwaad kaa hindi-anuwaad is prakaar he: i bow before you
 o mata! pani se sinchi, falon se bhari, dakshin kii vaayu ke saath shant, kataai kii fasalon ke saath gahari, mata! uski raaten chandani kii garima main prafullit ho rahi hai, uski jameen khilte phulon vaale vrikshon se bahut sundar dhaki hui he, hansee kii mithaas, vaani kii mithaas, mata! vardaan dene vaali, anand dene vaali
 In the 1870–80s, the British rulers held 'god! The song "save the Queen" was made mandatory
 angrejon ke is aadesh se bankimachandra chatarji ko, jo un dinon ek sarkari adhikari the, bahut thes pahaunchi or unhone sambhavat: 1876 main iske vikalp ke taur par sanskrit or bangla ke mishran se ek naye geet kii rachana kii or uskaa sheershak diya - ‘vande maataram’
 Initially, only two of its verses were composed, which were in Sanskrit
 in donon padon main keval mathrubhumi kii vandana thi
 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland
 yah upanyaas angreji shashan, jameendaaron ke shoshan va prakritik prakope main mar rahi janata ko jaagrit karnehetu achaanak uth khadey hue sanyasi vidroh par aadhaarit tha
 This factual history was mentioned by Bankim Babu himself in the third edition of 'anand Math'
 or maje kii baat yah he ki saare tathy bhi unhone angreji vidwaanon-gleg va hanter kii pustakon se diye the
 In the novel, this song is sung by a monk rebel named Bhawanand
 geet kaa mukhdaa vishuddh sanskrit main is prakaar he: "vande maataram ! sujalaan sufalaan malayaj sheetlam, shasy shyamalam maataram
 "the verse after Mukhade is also in Sanskrit:" Shubhra Jyotsnaam Pulkit Yaminim, Ful Kusumit Drumdal Shobhinim; Suhasiniin Sumadhur Bhasheenam, Sukhaand Varadaan Mataram
 " kintu upanyaas main is geet ke aage jo pad likhe gayi the ve upanyaas kii mul bhashaa arthath bangla main hi the
 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga
 yah geet ravivaar, karthik sudi navami, shake 1797 ko puraa hua
 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896
 paanch saal baad yani san 1901 main kalakatta main hue ek anya adhiveshan main shri charandas ne yah geet punah gaaya
 The song was given by Sarladevi Chaudharani at the Banaras session of 1905
 congress-adhiveshnon ke alaava aazaadee ke aandolan ke dauraan is geet ke prayog ke kaaphi udhaaharan maujuud hai
 Lala Lajpat Rai started the publication of the journal from Lahore named Vande Mataram
 angrejon kii goli kaa shikaar banakar dam todanevaali aazaadee kii divaani maatangini haajra kii jubaan par aakhri shabd "vande maataram" hi the
 In 1907, when Madame Bhikhaji Cama hoisted the tricolor in Stuttgart, Germany, "vande Mataram" was written in the middle of it
 arya printing press, lahore tathaa bhartiya press, dehradun se san 1929 main prakashit kakori ke shahid pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' kii pratibandhit pustak "kranti gitanjali" main pehla geet "matra-vandana" vande maataram hi tha jisamen unhone keval is geet ke do hi pad diye the or uske baad is geet kii prashasti main vande maataram sheershak se ek swarchit urdu ghazal di thi jo us kalkhand ke asankhya anaam hutatmaon kii aawaaj ko abhivyakti detii he
 Restricted in the British period, this book is now edited and available in libraries
 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved
 swatantrata prapti ke baad dow rajendra prasad ne samvidhan sabha main 24 janvari 1950 main 'vande maataram' ko raashtragit ke rup main apnaane sambandhi vaktavy padhaa jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 konigsburg ke saat pul ganit kii ek aitihaasik rup se prasiddh paheli he
 In 1736, Leonard Oiler showed that there is no solution to this and simultaneously laid the foundation of the fields of topology and graph theory
 prushia ke rajya main pregel nadi ke donon kinaaron par basaa konigsburg naam kaa ek shahar tha
 There were two islands in the middle of the river which were connected to each other and to the mainland by seven bridges
 paheli yah thi: kya koi aisa maarg dhundha ja saktaa he jisamen har pul par se ek or keval ek, baar guzara jaae? paheli main pul hi nadi ko paar karne kaa ekmaatr tareeqa the or kisi bhi pul par aadhe raste jaakar lautnaa manaa tha
 Nor was it allowed to go twice on any bridge
 oiller ne dikhaaya ki is paheli kaa koi hal nahin he, yani aisa koi maarg nahin he jo har pul par ek or sirf ek, hi baar le jaae
 Oiler was the first to say that only bridges are important in this puzzle
 unke alaava shahar main or kin margon par niklaa jaataa he, isaki koi ahmiyat nahin
 This enabled him to use a graph with simple lines instead of a tangled map of the city
 is graph ne paheli kaa saar spasht kar diya
 → → isaki lakeeren pul thim or iske bindu shahar ke anya hisse
 Now the question was straightforward: Can any path be taken starting from any one point which passes only once on every line? Oiler observed that except for the start and end points of any route, each intersection point would have to be entered by one line and exit by another line
 yani agar har pul par ek hi baar jane kii anumati he to kisi bhi bindu par shunya, do yaa do ke gunaj kii sankhya ke pul hone chahiyein
 But it can be seen that there are odd number of bridges at every point of the puzzle
 iskaa sidhaa taatpary yah he ki yah paheli jis prakaar kaa maarg maang rahi he aisa koi maarg ban hi nahin saktaa
 Oiler's method of understanding this puzzle was very influential

 To reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies (or more), some countries have imposed limits on the number of embryos to be transferred, but these limits are not followed or accepted at all locations
 There is a spontaneous division of embryos in the uterus after transfer, but it is very rare and it gives birth to identical identical twins

 The Roman Catholic Church opposes all forms of artificial environmental fertilization because, like contraception, in the process the reproductive purpose of the marital act is separated from its intended purpose: carch ke magisterium dwaara aksar varnit yah vishesh siddhant ishwar dwaara sthapit us atoot sambandh par aadhaarit he jise manushya nahin tod saktaa

 This union that gives existence to an infant is no longer the act in which two individuals entrust themselves to each other, but rather an act in which "the life and identity of the fetus is trusted by physicians and biologists Handed over and thus this act establishes technology's dominance over the basic nature of man and his fate

" The Catholic Church believes that infertility is a call from God to adopt children because gospel main yah darshaya gaya he ki anurvarataa koi ghor pope nahin he
