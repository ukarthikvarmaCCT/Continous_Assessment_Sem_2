 Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the basis of sustainable mechanics
 ye niyam kisi vastu par lagane vaale bal or usase utpann us vastu kii gati ke bich sambandh bataate hai
 They have been expressed in many ways in three centuries
 newton ke gati ke teenon niyam, parmparik rup se, sankshep main nimnlikhit hai- Newton first compiled them in his book Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica
 newton ne anek sthanon par bhautik vastuon kii gati se sambandhit samasyaon kii vyakhya main inkaa prayog kiya tha
 In the third part of his book, Newton demonstrated that these three laws of motion and their universal law of gravitation are capable of interpreting Kepler's laws related to the motion of celestial bodies
 newton ke gati niyam sirf unhi vastuon par lagaaya jaataa he jinhen ham ek kan ke rup main maan sake
 Meaning that when measuring the speed of those objects, their size is ignored
 un vastuon ke pind ko ek bindu main kendrit man kar in niyamo ko lagaaya jaataa he
 This is done when the distances in the analysis are much larger than the objects
 isliye grahon ko ek kan maan kar unke kakshiya gati ko mapa ja saktaa he
 In its original form, the rules of these motions cannot be applied to fixed and deformable bodies
 1750 main leonard ular ne newton ke gati niyamo kaa vistaar kiya or ular ke gati niyamon kaa nirmaan kiya jinhen drudh or virupanshil pindo par bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If an object is considered to be a combination of discrete particles, in which Newton's laws of motion can be applied separately, Euler's law of motion can be derived from Newton's law of motion
 newton ke gati niyam bhi kuch nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hote he jinhen jadtviya nirdesh tantra kaha jaataa he
 Many authors believe that the first rule defines the inertial instruction system and the second law is valid only with those instruction systems, for this reason the first rule cannot be called a special form of the second law
 par kuch pehle niyam ko duusare kaa parinaam maanate he
 The explicit concept of directive systems developed long after Newton died
 newtoni yantriki kii jagah ab oinstin ke vishesh aapekshikta ke siddhant ne le lee he par phir bhi iskaa istemaal prakaash kii gati se kam gati vaale pindon ke liye abhi bhi kiya jaataa he
 In Newton's original words hindi anuwaad "every object remains in its stagnation or uniform velocity until it is induced to change its state by some external factor
 " In other words, the object which is in resting state will remain in the resting state and the object which is in motion will remain in motion unless any external force is applied on it
 newton kaa pratham niyam padaarth ke ek prakritik gun jadtv ko paribhaashit karat he jo gati main badlaav kaa virodh karata he
 Therefore, the first law is also called the law of inertia
 yah niyam apratksh rup se jadtviya nirdesh tantra tathaa bal ko bhi paribhaashit karata he
 Because of this, this rule was put first by Newton
 is niyam kaa saral pramanikaran mushkil he kyonki gharshan or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ko zyaadaatar pind mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, Galileo described this observation before Newton
 newton ne anya shabdon main ise vyakt kiya
 In Newton's original words: hindi main anuwaad "A change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the impact on the object and occurs in the same direction
" "newton ke is niyam se adholikhit bindu vyupatrit kiye ja sakate he : Where f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} force, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} momentum and t { \ displaystyle t} are time
 is sameekaran ke anusaar, jab kisi pind par koi bahya bal nahin he, to pind kaa samveg sthir rahata he
 When the mass of the body is constant, the equation can be written in a simpler form: jahaan m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman he or a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} twaran he
 That is, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force applied
 aaveg dwitiya niyam se sambandhit he
 Impulse means a change in momentum
 arthath: Where i is the impulse
 aaveg takkaron ke vishleshan main bahut ahm he
 Let the mass of a body be m
 is par ek niyam bal f ko ∆tsamayanwarala ke liye lagane par veg main ∆v parivartit ho jaataa he
 Then Newton- atah kisi pind ko diya gaya aaveg, pind main utpann samveg- parivartan ke samaan hota he
 Therefore, the unit of impulse is the same as that of the impulse
 tritiy niyam kaa arth he ki kisi bal ke sangat ek or bal he jo uske samaan or vipareet he
 Newton used this rule to describe the law of momentum conservation, but actually momentum conservation is a more fundamental principle
 kai udahaaran hai jinamein samveg sangrakshit hota he lekin tritiy niyam maanya nahin he

 pracheen bhartiya granthon main vyakti nirmaan par jor diya gaya he
 Hindu rites have an important role in this
 rugveda main sanskaron kaa ullekh nahin he, kintu is granth ke kuch sookhton main vivaah, garbhaadhan or antyeshti se sambandhit kuch dharmik krityon kaa varnan miltaa he
 In the Yajurveda only Shrout Yajnas are mentioned, so special information about the rites of this scripture is not available
 atharvaveda main vivaah, antyeshti or garbhaadhan sanskaron kaa pehle se adhik vistrut varnan miltaa he
 Religious acts of Upanayana Godan rites are found in Gopath and Shatapatha Brahmins
 taittiriya upanishad main shiksha samaapti par acharya kii dikshant shiksha milti he
 In this way we do not get complete rules of rites before the Griसूasutras
 aisa prathit hota he ki grihasutron se purv paaramparik prathaon ke aadhaar par hi sanskaar hote the
 First of all, the description of the whole system of rites is found in the Grihyasutras
 grihyasutron main sanskaron ke varnan main sabase pehle vivaah sanskaar kaa ullekh he
 After this, conception, punsavan, seamantonnayan, jat-karma, naming, exodus, food-prasan, chuda-karma, upanayana and samvartana rites are described
 adhiktar grihyasutron main antyeshti sanskaar kaa varnan nahin miltaa, kyonki aisa karnaa ashubh samajha jaataa tha
 Rituals are mentioned in ethics cases of memories and rules are given in this regard
 inamen upanayan or vivaah sanskaron kaa varnan vistaar ke saath diya gaya he, kyonki upanayan sanskaar ke dwaara vyakti brahmacharya ashram main or vivaah sanskaar ke dwaara grihasth ashram main pravesh karata tha
 The sacrament refers to the religious acts that are done to purify one's body, mind and mind in order to make a person a fully qualified member of his or her community, but Hindu rituals aim to inculcate the desired qualities in the person
 Had to give
 vaidic sahitya main "sanskaar' shabd kaa prayog nahin miltaa
 The description of sacraments is mainly found in the Grihyasutras, but in these also the word sacrament has been used in the sense of sanctification of Yajna material
 vaikhanas smriti sutara main sabase pehle sharir sambandhi sanskaron or yagyon main spasht antar miltaa he
 According to Manu and Yajnavalkya, sacraments purify the womb of the Dwijs and the guilt of the seed
 kumaril ne tantravaarthik granth main iske kuch bhinn vichaar prakat kiye hai
 According to him, man becomes qualified in two ways - pre- by removing the defects of karma and by producing new qualities
 sanskaar ye donon hi kaam karte hai
 Thus, in ancient India, rites had special significance in the life of man
 sanskaron ke dwaara manushya apni sahaj pravritiyon kaa purna vikaas karke apana or samaaj donon kaa kalyaan karata tha
 These rituals did not sanctify the human being in this life, he also made his earthly life sacred
 prayek sanskaar se purv home kiya jaataa tha, kintu vyakti jis grihyasutra kaa anukaran karata ho, usee ke anusaar aahutiyon kii sankhya, havyapadaarthon or mantron ke prayog main alag- alag pariwaron main bhinnata hoti thi
 The number of rites is written forty in the Gautam Dharmasutra

 Conception, 2
 Pusvan, 3

 Caste work, 5

 Food Question, 7 Chaul, 8

 kintu adhiktar dharamshasron ne vedon ke chaar vraton, panch dainik mahayagyon, saat pakyagyon, saat haviryagyon or saat somayagyon kaa varnan sanskaron main nahin kiya he
 Manu mentions these thirteen rites of conception, pusavana, seamantonnayan, jatakarma, naming, ejaculation, annaprashan, chudakarma, upanayana, keshant, inclusiveness, marriage and cremation
 yajyavlky ne bhi inhen sanskaron kaa varnan kiya he
 The description of Keshant alone is not found in it, because by this time the practice of studying Vedic texts had stopped
 baad main rachi gai paddatiyon main sanskaron kii sankhya solah di he, kintu gautam dharmasutra or grihyasutron main antyeshti sanskaar kaa ullekh nahin he, kyonki antyeshti sanskaar kaa varnan karnaa ashubh mana jaataa tha
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati in his Sanskrit method and Pandit Bhimsen Sharma in his Shodash Sanskrit method have described only sixteen samskaras
 in donon lekhakon ne antyeshti ko solah sanskaron main sammilit kiya he
 In pregnancy, there are three sacraments of conception, purusavana, and marginal promotion
 in teenon kaa uddeshy mata- pita kii jivan- charya is prakaar kii bananaa he ki balak achche sanskaron ko lekar janm le
 Jat- Karma, Naming, Exodus, Annaprashan, Mundan, Karna Bedha, these six sanskaras end at the age of five
 balykaal main hi manushya kii aadaten banati hai, atah ye sanskaar bahut jaldi- jaldi rakhe gayi hai
 Upanayana and Vedambha rites were often performed together at the beginning of the Brahmacharyaram
 samaavartan or vivaah sanskaar grihasthashram ke purv hote hai
 They should also understand together
 vanprastha or sanyas sanskaar in donon ashramon kii bhoomika maatr hai
 Funerals, rites do not have any relation to the soul of the deceased
 uskaa uddeshy to mrit purush ke sharir ko sugandhit padaarthon sahit jalaakar vaayu mandal main failaana he, jisase durgandh aadi na faile
 The purpose of these rites is as follows: 1
 Rites are performed to reduce seedling

 Nirmala is a famous Hindi novel composed by Munshi Premchand
 iskaa prakaashan san 1927 main hua tha
 Writing of this novel started in 1926, on the basis of dowry system and mismatched marriage
 elahabaad se prakashit hone vaali mahilaon kii patrika 'chaand' main navambar 1925 se disambar 1926 tak yah upanyaas vibhinn kishton main prakashit hua
 This novel has a special place in the history of women-centered literature

 Nirmala is married to a middle-aged man
 jiske purv patni se teen bete hai
 Nirmala's character is serene, but still she has to suffer humiliation and disregard in the society

 Through Nirmala, the miserable condition of India's middle class women is depicted
 upanyaas ke ant main nirmala kii mrityri is kutsit saamaajik pratha ko mitaa daalane ke liye ek baari chunauti he
 Premchand has created humor in the novel by the context of Bhalchand and Moteram Shastri
 nirmala ke chaaron ore katha-bhawan kaa nirmaan karte hue asambaddh prasangon kaa purnatah bahishkaar kiya gaya he
 With this, this novel has become more structured and well organized than Sevasadan
 ise premachand kaa pratham ‘yathartwaadee’ tathaa hindi kaa pratham ‘manovaigyanik upanyaas’ kaha ja saktaa he
 One peculiarity of Nirmala is that the omission of 'preacher Premchand' in it has not only made it artistic but has also become an evolution of the craft of Premchand

 "make it New!" For the poet Ezra Pound had a form of prohibitive injunction
 aadhuniktaavaadiyon ke "nav nirmaan" main ek nayaa aitihaasik yug shaamil tha yaa nahin, yah ab bahes kaa mudda bana hua he
 The philosopher and composer Theodore Adorno warns us: adorno ne hamen aadhuniktaa ko gyanoday kii soch, kala, evam sangeet kii galat samaj, sadbhaav or sambaddhta kii asweekruti ke rup main samajhaayaa hoga
 lekin ateet chipchipa sabit hota he
 The general imperative of Pound's new creation, and Adorno's challenging sermon of mis-affiliation and harmony, was the issue of the artist's relationship with tradition

 Current interpretations of modernism differ
 kuch beesvin sadi kii pratikriya ko aadhuniktawaad evam uttaradhuniktawaad main vibhajit karte hai, jabaki anya inhen ek hi aandolan ke do pahaluon ke rup main dekhte hai
 Some commentators propose modernism as a purely socially progressive trend of thinking, which, with the help of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology, seeks to build its environment, improve and reshape it
 Confirms the power of mankind
 is drushtikon se, aadhuniktawaad ne vaanijya se darshan tak astitv ke prayek pahalu kii punah pariksha ko protsaahit kiya, jiskaa lakshya yah pataa lagaana tha ki pragati main kis vajah se rukawat paidaa ho rahi thi or usee lakshya tak pahunchane ke liye isaki jagah nae tareekon kaa istemaal kiya
 Others present modernism as a aesthetic introspection
 yah pratham vishwa yuddh main praudyogiki ke upyog kii vishisht pratikriyaaon or nitshe se samuel baket ke samay ke vibhinn vichaarkon or kalakaaron kii rachanaaon ke praudyogiki-virdohi evam shoonyavaadee pahaluon ke soch-vichaar ko sahaj banaata he
 In the first half of the nineteenth century there were countless wars and revolutions in Europe, which contributed to a aesthetic change "different" from the realities of political and social fragmentation, and thus Romanticism - the emphasis on individual subjective experience, sublime, as a subject of art The supremacy of "nature", the revolutionary or radical expansion of expression and a freedom towards personal freedom - Intuitive built
 By the middle of this century, however, a synthesis of these ideas with stable governing forms had appeared, partly in response to the failure of the loving and democratic revolutions of 1848

 Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting in the late 1940s revolutionized the ability of all contemporary art that followed him

 Clement Greenberg became the voice of postcolonial abstractions when he collaborated in an inspiring exhibition of novel painting in 1964 visiting important art museums throughout the United States
 Color field painting, hard-edged painting, and lyrical abstractions appeared as radical new directions

 By the early 1960s, minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art that abandoned the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of abstract expressive surfaces, and the polemic skills and emotional euphemisms present in the field of action painting
 Minimalism argued that excessive simplicity could capture all the specific performance required in art
 frank stela jaise chitrakaaron kaa sahyog praapt karne vaala, anya kshetron ke vipareet, chitrakala ke kshetra main atisookshmavaad ek aadhuniktaavaadi aandolan he
 Minimalism is variously considered either a precursor to postmodernism, or itself a postmodern movement

 Hill Foster in his essay entitled The Crooks of Minimalism examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both accept and extend Greenbergist modernism in their published definitions of minimalism
 vah tark dete hai ki atisookshmavaad aadhuniktawaad kaa ek "mrit ant" nahin, balki "aaj bhi vistaar kiye jane vaale uttaradhunik prathaon kaa ek nidarshanatmak badlaav" he
 In the late 1960s Robert pincus-witten coined the term postmodernism to describe minimalist-derived art that contained material and contextual motives that minimalism had discarded
 pinkos-whitten ne eva hes, kith sonier, richard serra kii rachanaaon or robert smithsan, robert morris, evam sol leavit jaise purv atisookshmavaadiyon or bairi le vaa, evam anya hastiyon kii nai rachanaaon ke liye is shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Minimalists, including Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Carl André, Agnes Martin, John mccracken, and others, continued to produce late-stage modernist painting and sculpture for the remainder of their careers

 Since then, many artists have adopted minimalist and post-minimalist styles and have been labeled "postmodern"
 chitrakala evam murtikla kii pichhali parampara se dur jane vaale kalakaar samagriyon ke saath nirmit vastuon ke sangyojan kaa udbhav amoort abhivyanjanawad se sambandhit tha
 Robert Rauschenberg's work exemplifies this trend

 Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine and Edward Keenholz were among the leading pioneers of both abstract and pop arts

 In the early 20th century, Marcel Duchamp exhibited a urinal as a sculpture
 unhone apni manshaa jaahir karte hue kaha ki log mutralay ko is tarah se dekhte hai maanon yah ek kalakriti ho kyonki unhone kaha ki yah ek kalakriti thi
 He referred to his act as "readymades"

 mat kaa hastakshar tha, jisaki pradarshnee ne 1917 main kala kii duniya ko hairaani main daal diya
 ise or ducamp ke anya krityon par aam taur par dada kaa label laga hua he
 Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, among other well-known examples being John Cage's 4'33 "and Rauschenberg's Erased Day Kooning, the 4'33" four-minute thirty-second silence
 kai vichaarik krity sthiti ko grahan karte hai ki kala ek vastu ko dekhne vaale ke nazariye yaa kala ke rup main kaam karne kaa parinaam he, na ki khud us krity kii aatanrik gunvattta kaa
 is tarah, chunki fountain kaa pradarshan kiya gaya, yah ek murtikla thi
 Marcel Duchamp famously abandoned "art" in favor of chess
 Art-leading composer David Tudor wrote an article called Reunion that he wrote together with Lovell Cross, which depicts a game of chess in which each move triggers a luminous effect or projection
 ducamp or kej ne krity ke premier par is khel ko khelaa
 Steven Best and Douglas Kelner identify Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns as part of the transitional phase, inspired by Marcel Duchamp, between modernism and postmodernism
 donon ne ucch aadhuniktawaad ke sargrahan evam chitrakaar ke bhav ko kaayam rakhte samay apni rachanaaon main saadhaaran vastuon kii chhaviyon ko yaa khud vastuon kaa istemaal kiya
 Another trend in the art associated with neo-dada is the use of innumerable different mediums simultaneously

 Groups such as The Living Theater, along with Julian Beck and Judith Malina, collaborated with sculptors and painters to create the atmosphere and fundamentally changed the relationship between the viewer and the exhibitor, particularly in his composition Paradise Now
 Judson Dance Theater and Judson Dancers located at Judson Memorial Church in New York, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Ellen Summers, Sally Grosse, Simone Forty, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others by Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage worked closely with artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and engineers such as Billy Kluwer
 park place gailaree steve retch, philip glass jaise electronic sangeetkaaron or joan jonas sahit anya ullekhneey pradarshan kalakaaron ke sangeet pradarshan kaa ek centre tha
 The intention of these performances was to showcase creations of a new art form that included sculpture, dance and music or sound that often had audience participation
 unhen atisukshmvaad kii nunikrut darshanon or amoort abhivyanjanawad ke sahaj aashurachana evam vyanjaktaa dwaara abhilakshyit kiya jaataa tha
 During the same period, various art-leading artists created spectacles

 Notable creators of these shows included Alan Capro, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Robert Whitman
 alan capro kii pradarshan kala ne kala or jivan ko ekikrut karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Through the spectacle, the separation between life, art and the viewer is blurred
 ye tamaashe kalakaar ko sharir kii gati, record kii gai dhwani, likhit evam kathith paathya or yahaan tak ki gandh ke saath bhi prayog karne kii anumati pradaan karte hai
 One of Alan Capro's earliest acts was "happenings in the New York Scene", composed in 1961, when the color was developing
 1958 main capro ne "da ligesi of jackson polak" naamak niabandh prakashit kiya
 In it he calls for a "tangible art" made of everyday materials such as color, chair, food, electricity and fixed light, smoke, water, old socks, dog, film

 Another trend of post-modern art is the use of innumerable media simultaneously
 antarmadhyam, is shabd kaa avishkaar dick higgins ne kiya tha jiskaa taatpary fluxs, moort kavita, praapt vastuon, pradarshan kala or computer kala kii panktiyon ke saath nae kalaroopon ko sampreshit karnaa he

 ihab hasan uttaradhunik kala kii visheshtaon kii apni suchi main "intermedia, roopon kaa sanlayan, adhikaron kaa bhram" shaamil karte hai
 One of the most common methods of "multi-media art" is the use of video-tape and CRT monitors, referred to as video art
 haalanki kai kalaon ko ek kala main sanyojit karne kaa siddhant kaaphi purana he or samay-samay par ise punerjeevit kiya jaataa rahaa he, uttaradhunik abhivyakti aksar pradarshan kala ke saath judi hui he, jahaan naatakeey upapath ko hataa diya jaataa he or jo kuch bachataa he vah kalakaar ke sandigdh vishisht vaktavy yaa unke kaaryon kaa vaicharik vaktavy hota he
 Fluxus was named and uninterruptedly organized in 1962 by an American artist named Lithuania-born George Massiños

 Many of his students were artists who worked in other media who had little or no knowledge of music
 kej ke chaatro main fluxs kii sthapana karne vaale sadsy jackson mike lo, al hensen, jorge bract or dick higgins shaamil the
 Fluxus encouraged the aesthetic principle of do-it-yourself and gave importance to simplicity over complexity
 Like Dada before it, Fluxus featured a powerful anti-commercialization stream and an anti-art sensibility that ignored the traditional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice
 fluxs kalakaar uplabdh samagriyon ke saath kaam karne ko praathamikta dete the or apni khud kii rachana kaa nirmaan karte the yaa apane sahyogiyon ke saath nirmaan prakriya main sahyog karte the
 Andreas Hussen criticizes Fluxus' attempts to postmodernism as "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately untouchable art movement - as if it were the best style of postmodernism"
 iske bajaay vah fluxs ko kala-agrani parampara ke bheetar ek pramukh nav-dadawadi ghatana ke rup main dekhte hai
 It demonstrated a major advancement in the development of artistic strategies, although it was an expression of a rebellion against the "administered culture of the 1950s," in which a liberal, friendly modernism served as the theoretical basis of the Cold War

 sangeet or sahitya main uttaradhuniktawaad ne isse bhi pehle, kuch logon ke anusaar 1950 ke dashak tak, apni pakad majboot karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 While postmodernism has been in force since the end of modernism, many theorists and scholars argue that postmodernism persists into the 21st century as well
 kai aadhuniktaavaadiyon kaa maananaa tha ki parampara kaa tyaag karke ve moulik rup se kala nirmaan ke nae tareekon kaa avishkaar kar sakate the
 Arnold Schoenberg abandoned the traditional tonal harmony, the hierarchical system of producing musical compositions that had pioneered music production for at least a decade and a half
 unka maananaa tha ki unhone baarah-swar panktiyon ke upyog ke aadhaar par sangeet rachana ke ek sampoorn nae tareeke kaa avishkaar kar liya tha
 Abstract artists, who call themselves impressionists, as well as Paul Cezanne and Edward Munch, began with the notion that color and shape, not the depiction of the natural world, formed essential features of art
 vaisili candinsky, peet mondrian or kaazimir malewich sabhi shuddh rang kii vyavastha ke rup main kala ko phir se paribhaashit karne main vishwaas karte the
 Photography heavily influenced this aspect of modernism, making most representational acts of visual arts obscure
 haalanki, ye kalakaar is baat par bhi vishwaas karte the ki bhautik vastuon ke chithran kaa tyaag karke unhone kala ko vikaas ke ek bhautikwaadi charan se ek aadhyaatmavaadi charan main sthanantarit karne main madad kiya tha
 The ideas of other modernists, especially those involved in design, were more practical

 le corbiziyar kii soch thi ki imaaraton ko "nivas karne ke mashiinon" ke rup main, kaaron ke anuroop, kaary karnaa chahie, jise unhone yatra ke mashiinon ke rup main dekha tha
 Just as cars replaced horses, modernist design should abandon the ancient styles and structures that existed from ancient Egypt or the Middle Ages
 In some cases Roop superseded the works
 is mashin soundarya siddhant kaa anusaran karte hue aadhuniktaavaadi dizineron ne aam taur par dizine main sajaavati rupankanon kaa tyaag kar diya or prayukt samagriyon or shuddh rekhikeey roopon par jor dena pasand kiya
 Skyscrapers such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York became archetypal modernist buildings
 makaanon or furniture ke aadhuniktaavaadi dizine ne bhi aam taur par rup kii saadagi evam spashtataa, mukt-yojana aatanrik bhaag or avyavashtha ke abhaav par jor diya

 In contrast, in the 20th century, public buildings became vertically oriented and private buildings were established horizontally
 Even today, many aspects of modernist design persist within the mainstream of contemporary architecture, though its previous dogma has provided a more juicy use of decoration, historical quotation, and spatial drama
 anya kala main is tarah ke vyaavhaarik vichaar kam mahatvapurn the
 Some modernists in literature and visual arts primarily wanted to ignore expectations to make their art more bright or to compel audiences to take the trouble to question their own prejudices
 aadhuniktaa kaa yah pahalu aksar upabhokta samskruti kii ek pratikriya lagati he jiskaa vikaas 19veen sadi ke ant main europe evam uttar america main hua tha
 While most manufacturers attempt to manufacture products that will be marketed through the lure of preferences and adverse effects, high modernists abandon such consumerist approaches to undermine traditional thinking
 Art critic Clement Greenberg explained this theory of modernism in an essay titled avant-garde & Kitsch
 Greenberg labeled consumer culture products as "kitsch" because their design was simply aimed at achieving maximum attractiveness and simultaneously removed any difficult features
 is tarah greenberg ke anusaar aadhuniktawaad ne vanijyik lokapriy sangeet, hollywood or vigyaapan ke rup main aadhunik upabhokta samskruti ke aise udaahranon ke vikaas ke khilaaf ek pratikriya kii sthapana kii

 Some modernists saw themselves as part of a revolutionary culture that included political revolutions

 Many modernists saw themselves as apolitical
 Others, eg - TS Elliot, abandoning vast popular culture from a conservative position
 Some also argue that modernism in literature and art served to nurture a transcendent culture that excluded the majority of the population
 isaki parampara kii asweekruti aadhunik aandolan kii sabase vivaadaaspad pahalu thi or he
 Modernism's emphasis on primitiveism, fundamentalism, experimentation and freedom of expression ignores traditional expectations

 In literature this often included the renunciation of explicit plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that ignored explicit interpretation
 stallin ke udai ke baad, soviet samyavaadee sarkaar ne kathith utkrushtavargvaad ke aadhaar par aadhuniktawaad kaa tyaag kar diya, haalanki isane pehle bhavishyavaad evam nirmaanvad kaa samarthan kiya tha
 The Nazi government of Germany considered modernism to be "jewish" and "habshi" along with autobiographical and nonsensical
 The Nazis exhibited the works of mentally ill artists as well as modernist paintings in an exhibition titled Degenerate Art
 "ritivaad" ke aarope ke parinamswaroop kisi ke kariyar kaa ant ho saktaa tha, yaa isaki badtar haalat ho sakati thi
 For this reason, many modernists of the post-war generation felt that they were the most important barrier against totalitarianism, the "coal mine informers" whose repression by a government or any other group of expected officials represented a warning

 Celebrities like Bob Dylan, Serge Gainsbourg, and The Rolling Stones, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, James Thurber, TS
 Elyt, Gilloum Apollinaire, Ellen Ginsberg, and others combined popular musical traditions with modernist verses, eclipsing literary instruments derived from them
 The Beatles developed similar lines, composing various modernist musical influences on several albums, while composers such as Frank Zappa, Sid Barrett and Captain Beefheart proved even more experimental
 Modernist devices also appeared in popular cinema and later music videos
 Modernist designs also entered the mainstream of popular culture, when simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a space-age high-tech future

 doosraa, isane yah dikhaaya ki utkrushtwargeey aadhuniktaavaadi or vishaal upabhoktavaadi samskruti ke bich ke bhed ne apni parishuddhta ko kho diya tha
 Some writers declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now "post-art-pioneering", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement
 kaiyon ne is parivartan kii vyakhya us charan kii shuruyaat ke rup main kii he jise uttaradhuniktawaad ke naam se prachlit hua
 According to others such as art critic Robert Hughes, postmodernism represents an extension of modernism
 "aadhunik-virdohi" yaa "pratyaadhunik" aandolan aadhuniktawaad ke nivaaran yaa pratikaar ke rup main sakalyawaad, sangyojan evam aadhyatmikta par jor dena chaahate hai

 Writers such as The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World, Paul H
 Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, Frederick Turner in a Culture of Hope, and Lester Brown in Plan B, have themselves criticized the basic idea of modernism as individual creative Expression must conform to the realities of technology
 Instead, they argue, individual creativity should make everyday life more emotionally acceptable

 Postmodern theory emphasizes that the attempt to classify modernism with the title of "post facto" is beset by mismatched contradictions
 ek atisankeern arth main, jo kuch bhi aadhuniktaavaadi tha, vah aavashyakt rup se uttaradhunik bhi nahin tha
 The elements of modernism emphasizing the benefits of socio-technological progress and consciousness were only modernist

 Some believe that brother-in-law should not draw swords, so Kshemkarn himself says goodbye to Chittorgarh with the help of avoiding domestic war

 Maharana Suraj Mal, son of Kshemkarna expanded the 'new kingdom' in 1514 AD, making it a permanent place in Deogarh village
 baad main surajmal ke vanshaj maharavat pratapsingh ne 1689-1699 main devgarh se thodi dur, ek nayaa nagar 'pratapgarh' basaaya
 Devgarh or Devalia, which is today a sub-tehsil of Pratapgarh, about 12 kilometers from the district headquarters, has many mysteries of history and archeology within it as an ancient village
 yahan devliya main aaj bhi ek purana rajmahal, bhootpurv-rajgaraane ke smarak, talab, baavadiyaan, mandir or kai anya aitihaasik avshesh vidyaman hai
 There is an old temple of 'bijmata', a form of mother power in Devgarh itself, there is also the Lord Mallinath Temple of Jains and ram-darbar Temple, where the sculptor has shown Ram and Laxman in huge Rajasthani mustache
 isi mandir kii chat par surya ke prakaash kii sahaayta se samay bataane vaali sangemarmar kii dhoop ghadi bhi he
 According to the chronological order, the descent of the former rulers of Pratapgarh is found as follows: Kshemkarn Surajmal Bagh Singh Rai Singh Vikram Singh Tej Singh Bhanu Singh Sinha Jaswant Singh Hari Singh Maharawat Pratap Singh Prithvi Singh Sangram Singh Ummed Singh Gopal Singh Salim Singh Samant Singh Dalpat Singh Uday Singh Raghunath Singh Ramsingh and finally, Ambikaprasad Singh itihaas kii kitabon main 'paratabgarh-raaj' kii pandrahavin sadi se praayah agle sau saalon tak kaa koi lanbaa-chaudaa vivaran nahin miltaa, par During the Mughal and British period, Pratapgad state remained untouched by 'external' interventions, some not only because the erstwhile kings here decided to give an annual 'khiraj' of Rs 15,000 to the rulers of Delhi, but Salim Singh gave the Mughal- Renewed the written approval of the ruler Shah Alam to introduce new 'salimshahi Coins' for his kingdom, to be molded in the local-mint of 'paratabgarh' and Were taken
 1761 main malhaar raav holkar ke senapati tukoji raav ne pratapgarh kii gheraabandi kii, par vah yahaan se koi dhanrashi vasuul kar paane main naakaamayaab rahaa
 haan, do saal baad 1963 main malhaar raav holkar ne udaipur jate vaqt saalim singh se vasuuli zarur kii
 tab sab taraf maraathon kaa utpaat bada prabal tha
 During the reign of Samant Singh, son of Salim Singh, who had settled 'salamgarh' near Pratapgarh, the Marathas even tied up an annual 'khiraj' of Rs 72,720 / - Salimshahi rupees in lieu of not attacking and looting Pratapgarh
 Inspired by the terror of the Marathas, Samant Singh made a treaty with the British in 1804 and an agreement was made to give the same amount to the British, which the Marathas used to recover; But due to the new state policies of Lord Cornwallis, this agreement also remained in force for a long time and Pratapgad eventually came under the direct control of the British rule
 1818 main ek dfa phir pratapgarh kii angrezi sarkaar se 12 sutreey sandhi hui, jiske anusaar pehle saal main, 35,000 rupee or paanchaven saal main 72,700 / - rupee angrejon ko 'khiraj' main dene kaa ikraar kiya gaya
 Samant Singh handed over the rule of Pratapgad to his son Deep Singh, who worked well for some time, but some of the opponents of his own state found Deep Singh's rule at the local level to be extremely unsatisfactory and the incidents of rebellion against the regime intensified
 So, due to the crush of the rebels who raised the head, Deep Singh even got some killed
 This action of Deep Singh went to the English masters, and he ordered Deep Singh to go to Devgarh and stay there
 For some time, Deep Singh was almost under house arrest in Devgarh, but he returned to Pratapgarh shortly after, avoiding the rule of the British Raj
 angrezi raaj ko ye hukumauduli sahan na hui, lihaaza angarez fouj kii ek tukdi ne aamane-saamne kii ek ladaai main deep singh ko haraa kar bandi bana liya or achanera-kile main bhej diya, jahaan 1826 main ek kaidi ke rup main is raja ne antim saans lee

 After Deep Singh's Achnera imprisoned death, Samant Singh and his grandson Dalpat Singh ruled the kingdom, who succeeded him in 1844, but the following year in 1825, Dalpat Singh himself went to the king of Dungarpur, who ruled the English
 In the light of the decision of, his adopted son Uday Singh was declared Dungarpur Maharawal in his place and himself became the king of Pratapadha
 In 1862, he also got the message from the British rule that he and his heirs would have the right to adopt adopted sons
 1865 main jab udai singh gaddinshin hue to pratapgarh ke din sachmuch bahut kuch phire
 udai singh ne rajkaaj main kai sudhaar kiye, divaani adaalatein kaayam kin, kuch kar maaf kiye gaye, uchit mulya kii sarkari dukaane kholin or 1876-1878 ke kukhyat durbhiksh 'chappaniya-kaal' ke dauraan praja ke liye kai raahat kaary shuru kiye
 udai singh ne pratapgarh main apane liye kuch british tarz par ek alag mahal bhi banwaaya or rajya main prashasnic sudhaaron par gambhirtha se dhyaan kendrit kiya
 The first Ayurvedic dispensary was opened here in 1867 and some schools including the State Primary School in 1875 for free tribal education
 It was only in 1875 AD that the 'settlement Department' was formed
 do anbhavi hakimon ke alaava bandobast ke nae mahakme main sadar-munsarim, patawaari, bandobast-amin niyukt kiye gaye
 Initially 114 villages, including Sakthali, Hathunia and Magra villages, were arranged
 1884 main angrejon kii krupa se dak va taar vibhaag astitv main aayaa
 Uday Singh died in 1890, but since he had no son of his own, his widow Rani adopted her husband's cousin Raghunath Singh, who was accepted by the British rule in 1891 as the successor of the late Uday Singh
 isi saal 1893-94 main 'sadar aspataal' bana, chungi-mahakme ke alaava kuch ek daakghar bhi khule or sabase upyogi nirmaan kaary- gram raajpuria se hote hue ek pakkaa sadak maarg, pratapgarh se mandsaur banaaya gaya, jo rail se pratapgarh ke bashindon kaa pehla sampark-maarg bhi tha
 'mahakama Khas' was formed in 1894 AD
 is vibhaag jo pramukh likhit 'kartavya' nirdhaarit kiye gaye, ve the- bhu-rajasav kii vasuliyaan karnaa, divaani or faujadaari maamlat kaa faisla, rajya ke rajasav record kaa sandhaaran, 'bandobast-haakim' kii gaiyr maujuudagi main uske saare kaamkaaj dekhnaa, jan-sunwaayee, daure or nirikshan karnaa or gaanvon main lumbardaar or patwaariyon kii niyukti karnaa vagairah

 The modernization of the state also started since then
 In 1901, the Municipal Committee or 'municipality' was formed in Pratapgarh, 'pinhe Nobles School' was opened in 1903, in 1904 people, instead of a surprise road or elephant ride, were the first motor for the first time
 Car was seen
 raghunatha singh ke kaarykaal main 1904 main shahi-taksaal band kar di gayi, kyonki 'salimshahi' sikke kii bajaay angrezi-mudra ko hi pratapgarh rajya main 'rajya-mudra' ke rup main sweekaar kar liya gaya
 a new post of 'district-police-captain' was created in 1912 under the rule of Raghunath Singh
 state police-mahakme kaa punargathan hua or 'khalsa gaanvon' main bhi bhu-prabandh lagu kiya gaya
 At that time, Kulmi, Kumhar, Anjana and Mali were among the major cultivating castes, which had an average of 24 bighas of agricultural land
 tab bhi opium kii dhaturiya kism behad mashkur thi
 Irrigation was done by drawing water from charas from wells
 pratapgarh shahar main, jise 'paratabgarh ' likhaa or bolaa jaataa tha, krishi-vyapaar ke liye badi mandi laga karti thi
 Similar local agricultural mandis were also located at Aranod, Kanora, Motadi, Raipur and Salamgarh
 'paratabgarh' rajya kii vaarshik aamadani 1907 main kareeb 6 lakh thi
 Today the land revenue of the district is 20 lakhs and irrigation tax is 30 lakhs - which goes to the state treasury

 kehete hai, puraane jamaane main devgarh-pratapgarh kaa samrajya kareeb 889 vargamil kii paridhi main failaa hua tha
 It was then known as "kanthal-raj"
 'kanthal' kaa shabdic maayna he- 'kanth-pradesh' yaa kinare kaa bhubhag! Salim Singh had also built a park around to protect his city, with two small gates - 'talab Bari' and 'qila Bari' and 6 large entrances 'surajpol', 'bhatpura Bari', 'devaliya Darwaza' And 'dhamottar Darwaza'
 suraj doobane ke saath hi ye sab nagar-dwaar band kar die jate the, baahar se aane waalon ko suryoday tak shahar ke baahar hi raat bitaani padati thi
 Where is that old Pratabgarh now? The time cycle is really amazing! Now there is no perkota, nor those old gateways of the old appearance! All the old splendor of the days of kingship has been destroyed

 It seems that the Department of Archeology and Museums of the state has not conducted any detailed or serious survey of this ancient area, so unfortunately not a single site in the historical estate is classified in the category of 'protected Monuments', although for a long time Apart from local administration, many historians have been raising this demand! kuch jaandaar, kintu ab kachraghar ban chukin 14 puraani baavadiyon ke jirnoddhar ke prastaav jila prashasan ne bheje hai

 It is new
 isliye bechaari kuch nahin boli
 What a disaster it was
 do din to chaiyn kii bansi baja lene dete
 Why did Mian come in the middle of his wife as a bone in the cabana
 acha bolo rana ne mujhe kyon yaad kiya he? vah tahaakaa markar hans padaa
 The two had a deep friendship
 saamaanya din agar hote to vah bhi hansi main jawaab detaa
 Shardul himself was also very ticklish
 vah hansi majaak ke bina ek kshan ko bhi nahin rah saktaa tha, lekin vah bada gambhir tha
 Stop laughing friend sachmuch badi sankat kii ghadi aa gai he
 i also want to return immediately
 yah kahkar sahasaa vah chup ho gaya
 Had gone as a wedding party to his friend
 uske chehre par chai gambhirtha kii rekhaon ko dekhakar haada sardaar kaa man ashankit ho uthaa
 Nothing untoward has really happened
 doot sankoch rahaa tha ki is samay rana kii chitthee vah mitra ko de yaa nahin
 He brought Hada Sardar with instructions to immediately leave for the war
 use mitra ke shabd samaran ho rahe the
 The red marks of Mahawar in the nails of Hada's feet still emerged like that
 nav vivaahit hadi rani ke haathon kii menhadi bhi to abhi sukhi na hogi
 The husband and wife did not recognize each other properly
 kitna dukhadaayi hoga unka bichhoh? yah samaran karte hi vah sihar uthaa
 Do not know what is in the war? By the way, Rajput considers death as a toy
 ant main ji kadaa karke usne haada sardaar ke haathon main rana rajsingh kaa patr thama diya
 Rana had a message for him
 veeravar
 Immediately stop Aurangzeb's army with his army
 musalmaan sena uski sahaayta ko aage bad rahi he
 Right now i am surrounded by Aurangzeb
 uski sahaayta ko bad rahi fouj ko kuch samay ke liye uljhaakar rakhana he taaki vah sheeghra hi aage na bad sake tab tak main puraa kaam nipat letaa hum
 You can do this work very efficiently
 yadhyapi yah bada khatarnaak he
 You may have to put your life as well
 mujhe tum par bharosa he
 It was a test for Hadra Sardar
 ek ore mughalon kii vipul sena or uski sainik tukdi ati alp he
 Rana Raj Singh had liberated the peeled areas of Mewar from the clutches of the Mughals
 aurangzeb ke pita shahjahan ne apni edi chotii kii takat laga di thi
 He sat silently
 ab shashan kii bagdor aurangzeb ke haathon main ai thi
 Charumati's marriage to Rana fueled her hostility
 isi bich main ek baat or ho gayin thi jisane rajsingh or aurangzeb ko aamane saamne laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 This was an insult to the entire Hindu caste
 islam ko kubul karo yaa hindu bane rahane kaa dand baro
 By saying this, he imposed jizya tax on Hindus
 rana rajsingh ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Even his mind was not tolerating it
 iskaa parinaam yah hua kai anya hindu raajaaon ne use apane yahaan lagu karne main anakani kii
 His courage was increased
 gulaami kii zanjeeron ko tod phenkane kii agni jo mand pad gayin thi phir se prajjwalit ho gai thi
 Shivaji in the south, Chhatrasal in Bundelkhand, Guru Govind Singh in Punjab, Rathore Veer Durgadas in Marwar stood up against the Mughal Sultanate
 yahaan tak ki amer ke mirza raja jaisingh or marwar ke jaswant singh jo mughal sultanate ke do pramukh stambh the
 In them too, sympathy was generated towards freedom lovers
 mughal badshaah ne ek badi sena lekar mewar par akraman kar diya tha
 Rana Raj Singh did three parts of the army
 mughal sena ke aravali main na ghusane dene kaa daayitv apane bete jaisingh ko saupa tha
 The second son, Bhim Singh, was tasked to stop the king's aid from Ajmer
 ve swayan akbar or durgadas rathod ke saath aurangzeb kii sena par tut pade the
 He was conquered on all fronts
 badshaah aurangzeb kii badi priy cokesian begum bandi bana lee gayin thi
 Aurangzeb could somehow save his life with great difficulty
 mewar ke maharana kii yah jeet aisi thi ki unke jivan kaal main phir kabhi aurangzeb unke viruddh sir na uthaa sakaa tha
 But was the victory credited only to Rana or to someone else? Hada Rani and Hada Sardar did not feel sad in any way
 mughal badshaah jab chaaron ore rajputon se ghir gaye
 His life was also put to shame
 uskaa bachakar nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya tha tab usne dilli se apni sahaayta ke liye atirikt sena bulawaai thi
 Rana had already known this
 unhone mughal sena ke maarg main avrodh utpann karan ke liye haada sardaar ko patr likhaa tha
 Shardul Singh reached the friend with the same message
 ek kshan kaa bhi vilamb na karte hue haada sardaar ne apane sainikon ko kooch karne kaa aadesh de diya tha
 Now he had reached her to seek a final farewell from his wife
 kesaria bana pahane yuddh vesh main saje pati ko dekhakar hadi rani chaunk padi vah achambhit thi
 Where did Swami go? so early
 abhi to aap kah rahe the ki chaar chah maheenon ke liye yuddh se fursat mili he aaraam se kategi yah kya? aashcharya mishrit shabdon main hadi rani pati se boli
 Dear
 pati ke shaury or parakram ko parakhane ke liye liye hi to kshatraniyan isi din kii pratiksha karti he
 That auspicious moment has just arrived
 desh ke shatruon se do do haath hone kaa avasar mila he
 i have to leave here without delay
 hansate-hansate vidaa do
 i do not know if there should be an appointment again or not, Hadar Sardar smiled and said to his wife
 haada sardaar kaa man ashankit tha
 Really, if not returned
 meri is ardhangini kaa kya hoga ? ek ore kartavya or duusari ore tha patni kaa moh
 His mind was trapped in this inner atmosphere
 usne patni ko rana rajsingh ke patr ke sambandh main puri baat vistaar se bataa di thi
 The husband's throat is filled with tears while asking for farewell, this hand could not remain hidden from Raji's sharp eyes
 yadhyapi haada sardaar ne use bharsak chhipaane kii koshish kii
 Desperate mind takes the person away from victory
 us vir bala ko yah samajhate der na lagi ki pati ranbhumi main to ja rahaa he par mohagrast hokar
 To get husband Vijayashree, she sacrificed her attachment to the altar of duty
 vah pati se boli swami jaraa thahrie
 i just arrived
 vah daudi-daudi andar gayin
 Decorated the plate of Aarti
 pati ke mastak par tikaa lagaaya, uski aarti utaari
 She spoke to her husband
 main dhanya ho gayin, aisa vir pati paakar
 We are with you for birth
 rajput ramaniyan isi din ke liye to putr ko janm detii hai aap jaaen swami
 i will wait for you at the door with the victory garland
 usne apane netron main umadte hue aansuon ko pi liya tha
 Did not want to weaken her husband
 chalate chalate pati usase bolaa priy
 i could not give you any happiness, its only sadness, will you forget me? If i don't live xxrep 4 


 
 uske vaakya puure bhi na ho paae the ki hadi rani ne uske mukh par hatheli rakh di
 Neither owner
 aisi ashubh baaten na bolon
 i am Veer Rajputni, then also Veer's wife
 apana antim dharm acchhee tarah jaanati hum aap nishchit hokar prasthaan karen
 Make the teeth of the enemies of the country sour
 yahi meri prarthana he
 a little chieftain put the horse up
 rani use ekatak niharti raheen jab tak vah ankhe se ojhal na ho gaya
 The storm of weakness that was hidden in his mind, which he had so far stopped, flowed out of his eyes
 haada sardaar apni sena ke saath hawa se bate karata uda ja rahaa tha
 But living in his mind, he was coming and said that my wife really does not let me go away? He would explain the mind, but his attention would go there
 ant main usase rahaa na gaya
 He halfway sent his trusted soldiers to the queen
 uskon phir se samaran karaayaa tha ki mujhe bhoolanaa mat
 i will definitely return sandesh vaahak ko aashwast kar rani ne lautaaya
 On the second day another carrier arrived
 phir vahi baat
 Then one came on the third day
 is baar vah patni ke naam sardaar kaa patr laayaa tha
 Dear, i am taking on enemies here
 angad ke samaan pair jamaarak unako roak diya he
 They have to move a bit
 yah to tumhaare raksha kavach kaa pratap he
 But i am missing you very much
 patr vaahak dwaara koi apni priy nishaani avashya bhej dena
 i will lighten my heart by looking at him
 hadi rani patr ko padhakar soch main pad gayin
 If the mind of the warring husband is in memory of me, if my face is moving in front of his eyes, how will he fight the enemies? vijay shri kaa varan kaise karenge? uske man main ek vichaar kaundha
 She said bravely to the soldier? i am giving you my last mark
 ise le jaakar unhen de dena
 Garnish with a platter and cover it with a beautiful cloth and take it to your gallant general
 kintu ise koi or na dekhe
 Try them openly
 saath main meraa yah patr bhi de dena
 Hadi wrote in the letter of the queen
 main tumhen apni antim nishaani bhej rahi hum
 i am cutting all the bonds of your attachment
 ab befric hokar apane kartavya kaa paalan karen main to chali


 swarg main tumhaari baat johuungi
 In a blink of an eye, Hari Rani took out the sword from her waist, blew her head in one stroke
 vah dharti par ludhak padaa
 Tear stream flowed from the eyes of the soldier
 kartavya karm kathor hota he sainik ne swarna thaal main hadi rani ke kate sir ko sajaayaa
 Suhag's chooner covered it
 baari man se yuddh bhoomi kii ore daud padaa
 Looking at him, the chieftain was stunned, he could not understand why the teardrop was flowing from his eyes
 He slowly said why Yadusinh
 rani kii nishaani le aae? yadu ne kaanpate haathon se thaal uski ore badha diya
 a little chieftain kept looking at the wife's head with teary eyes
 uske mukh se keval itnaa niklaa uf hai rani
 What have you done sandehi pati ko itani badi sajaa de daali khayr
 i am coming to see you too
 haada sardaar ke moh ke saare bandhan tut chuke the
 He broke down on the enemy
 itnaa apratim shaury dikhaaya tha ki uski misaal milanaa bada kathin he
 He struggled till the last breath of life
 aurangzeb kii sahaayak sena ko usne aage nahin hi badaae diya, jab tak mughal badshaah maidan chhodkar bhaag nahin gaya tha
 Who credited this victory? To Rana Rajasinghi or to Hada Sardar
 hadi rani ko athwa uski is anokhi nishaani ko? Rao Jaswant Singh Kham ki Maddi: For Rao Chundawat Ratan Singh of Sulambar, the use of the word Hada is not appropriate
 hadi rani ko sambhavat: bundi ke haada shaskaon kii putree hone ke kaaran hadi rani kaha gaya
 Constitutional economics is a research program in the field of economics and constitutionalism beyond the definition of 'economic analysis of constitutional law' as per the "alternative groups of legal-institutional-constitutional rules that constrain the choices and activities of economic and political agents" Option "
 yah un niyamon ke bheetar aarthik or raajnneetik agenton ke vikalpon kii vyakhya se alag he, jo ek "roodhiwaadee" arthshaastra kaa vishay he
 Constitutional economics studies "the compatibility of effective economic decisions with existing constitutional frameworks and limitations or favorable conditions created by that framework"
 iskaa varnan sanvaidhanik maamalon par arthshaastra ke sadhano kaa prayog karne ke liye ek vyaavhaarik drushtikon ke rup main kiya gaya he
 a major concern of each country, for example, is the allocation of available national economic and financial resources appropriately
 is samasya kaa kanoonee samaadhaan sanvaidhanik arthshaastra ke daayre ke bheetar aata he
 Constitutional economics takes note of the important effects of political economic decisions, in contrast to the analysis limiting economic relations as functions of the dynamics of the delivery of "salable" goods and services
 "raajnneetik arthshaastri jo maanak salaah pradaan karnaa chaahate hai, unhen aavashyak rup se us prakriya yaa sanrachana par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie jiske antargat raajaneetak faisle liye jate hai
 The current constitution or structures or rules are "the subject of serious scrutiny"
 "raajnneetik arthshaastra" shabd ko pehali baar 1982 main america arthshaastri richard maikenji dwaara washington di
si
 main hue ek sammelan main charchaa ke mukhya vishay ko namit karne ke liye gadha gaya tha
 mckenzie's newly created experiment was adopted by another American economist at the time - James M
 Buchanan - as a new academic sub-topic
 yah us up-vishay par kiya gaya bukanan kaa kaary hi tha jisane 1996 main unke "aarthik or raajnneetik nirnay prakriya ke siddhant ke liye anubandhik or sanvaidhanik aadhaaron ke vikaas" ke liye unhen aarthik vigyaan kaa nobel puraskaar dilaayaa tha
 Buchanan rejects "any fundamental concept of a superior nation in intelligence, to those who are members of it"
 yah darshanik sthiti vastav main sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kii pramukh vishay-vastu he
 The approach of constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis that helps avoid a one-dimensional understanding
 bukanan kaa maananaa he ki kam se kam nagarikon kii kai pidiyon dwaara upyog ke liye abhipret samvidhan ko vyaktigat swatantraaa va nijee kushi ke prati apane aap main vyaavhaarik aarthik faislon ke liye or vyaktiyon evam unke adhikaron ke viruddh desh or samaaj ke hiton kaa taal-mail bithaane main anivaary rup se sakasham hona chahie
 Buchanan introduced strong interrelated concepts of "constitutional citizenship" and "constitutional disorganization"
 sanvaidhanik avyavashtha ek aadhunik niti he jisaki vyakhya samaaj-boojh ke bina kiye gaye kaaryon ke rup main yaa un niyamon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sabase acchhee tarah kii ja sakati he jo sanvaidhanik vyavastha ko paribhaashit karte hai
 This policy can be justified by references to strategic actions built on competing interests, regardless of their subsequent impact on political structure
 iske saath hi bukanan "sanvaidhanik naagarikta" kii avadharana kii shuruyaat karte hai jise unhone nagarikon dwaara unke sanvaidhanik adhikaron evam uttardayitvon ke anupaalan ke rup main namit karte hai jinhen sanvaidhanik niti ke ek moulik bhaag ke rup main mana janaa chahie
 Buchanan also underscores the importance of the preservation of moral principles underlying constitutional norms
 james bukanan ne likhaa tha "sanvaidhanik naagarikta kii naitikta kii tulana kisi maujuuda shashan ke niyamon dwaara lagaai gayi baadhaon ke bheetar anya vyaktiyon ke saath paraspar samvaad main sidhe taur par naitik vyavhaar se nahin kii ja sakati he
 In the normative moral sense any person can be fully responsible and thus unable to fulfill the moral requirement of constitutional citizenship
 " bukanan ne "sanvaidhaniktaa" shabd ko vyapak arth main mana or iskaa prayog pariwaron, companiyon or saarvajanik sansthaaon main lekin sabase pehle desh ke liye kiya
 Buchanan's Nobel Lecture referred to the work of the late 19th-century Swedish economist Knut Wiksel who greatly influenced Buchanan's research: "total utility to the community if the utility is zero for each individual member of the community There can be nothing other than zero
 " yah "da constichution of iconomik policy" sheershak nobel vyaakhyaan ke adhyay ke puralekh main vickcel kehete hai ki "chaahe alag-alag nagarikon ke liye prastaavit kaary ke phaayde unako lagane vaali isaki laagat se adhik hon, iskaa anumaan swayan un alag-alag vyaktiyon se behatar koi nahin laga saktaa he
 Ludwig van den Howe has an important opinion that constitutional economics attracts substantial inspiration of the reformist tendency that is the hallmark of Adam Smith's approach and that Buchanan's concept can be considered as its counterpart in the modern-day era that Smith " The science of law "
 " The increasing interest of the general public in the theory and practice of constitutional economics has already given rise to specialized academic journals such as the "constitutional Political Economy"
 nyaayadhish richard posnar neaarthik vikaas ke liye ek samvidhan ke mahatv par jor diya tha
 They examine the interrelationship between a constitution and economic development
 posnar sanvaidhanik vishleshan ko mukhya rup se nyaayadhishon kii samaj ke drushtikon se dekhte hai jo kisi samvidhan kii vyakhya or prayog ke liye ek mahatvapurn shakti kaa gathan karte hai, is prakaar aam kanoon main vastutah sanvaidhanik kaanoon ke dhaanche kaa nirmaan karte hai
 They emphasize the importance of constitutional provisions "in setting broad external limits for the exercise of judicial discretion"
 is prakaar kisi maamle par koshish karte samay ek nyaayadhish sabase pehle vivek or samvidhan ke patr dwaara nirdeshit hota he
 The role of economics in this process is to help the constitution "identify the consequences of alternative interpretation"
 vah aage bataate hai ki "arthshaastra un sawaalon ke liye antardrushti pradaan kar saktaa he jo uchit kanoonee vyakhya par lagu hote hai
 "finally, as Judge Posner asserts," the limits of the economic approach to deciding constitutional matters are set by the constitution
 "furthermore he argues that" effective protection of basic economic rights promotes economic development
 " With the increase in educational research in the field of constitutional economics in the US in the 1980s, the Supreme Court of India has been using a very comprehensive interpretation of several articles of the Indian Constitution for nearly a decade on behalf of the poor and Dalits on public interest The lawsuits were promoted
 yah sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kii prakriya ke vaastavik vyaavhaarik prayog kaa ek jwalanth udhaaharan he
 Valerie Jorkin, president of the Constitutional Court of Russian Federation, made a special reference to the educational role of constitutional economics
 "in Russia, the inclusion of new academic disciplines such as constitutional economics into the curriculum of the law and economics departments of the university becomes extremely important
" 
 " The Russian School of Constitutional Economics was founded in the early twenty-first century with the idea that constitutional economics allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis in the legal process, thus overcoming arbitrary economic and financial decision-making

 udhaaharan ke liye jab sainya kharch shiksha or samskruti par bajet ke kharch ko kam kar dete hai
 Constitutional economics studies such issues as the proper distribution of national wealth
 isamen sarkaar dwaara nyaaypalika par kiya gaya kharch bhi shaamil he, jo adhikansh parivartansheel or vikasshil deshon main purnataya kaaryakarini dwaara niyantrit hota he
 This harms the principles of "surveillance" over executive powers, as it generates a serious financial dependency of the judiciary
 nyaaypalika ke bhrashtachar ke do tareekon ke bich antar karnaa zaruri he: raashtra or nijee
 nyaaypalika kaa rashtriya bhrashtachar, kisi bhi vyavsaay ke liye rashtriya bazaar arthvyavastha kii ishtatam vruddhi or vikaas ko badhaava dena lagbhag asambhav bana detaa he
 The word "constitution" in the English language has many meanings which include not only such national constitution but also the charter of corporations, unwritten rules of different clubs, informal groups etc
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra kaa roosi model jise multah parivarti or vikasshil deshon ke liye banaaya gaya he, puri tarah se desh ke samvidhan kii avadharana par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 This model of constitutional economics is based on the understanding that it is necessary to narrow the gap between economic and social rights conferred by the Constitution and the annual economic policy, the law of the budget, and the administrative policies made by the government
 2006 main rasian academy of sciences ne sanvaidhanik arthshaastra ko ek alag shaikshik up-vishay ke rup main aadhikarik manyata di he
 Since many countries with subsequent political and economic systems have been considering their constitution as a concise legal document different from the economic policy of the country, thus the use of constitutional economics becomes a decisive condition for democratic development of the country and society

 The Islamic Revolution of Iran took place in 1979, as a result of which Iran was declared an Islamic Republic
 is kranti ko france kii rajyakranti or bolshevik kranti ke baad vishwa kii sabase mahaan kranti kaha jaataa he
 Due to this the Pahlavi dynasty came to an end and Ayatollah Khomeini became the head of Iran
 
 Iran's new regime is a theocracy where the supreme leader is a religious imam, but the rule is run by an elected president
 gauratlab he ki iran ek shiya bahul desh he
 The main reasons for this revolution were the policy of Iran's Pahlavi rulers to follow and follow western countries and the government's failed economic arrangements
 iske turat baad iraq ke nae shaasha saddaam hossain ne apane desh main iran samarthit shiya aandolan bhadakne ke dar se iran par akraman kar diya tha jo 8 saal tak chalaa or anirnit samaapt hua
 It is said that the British and Russians had taken over Iran in 1941 - although nothing like this happened in military and written form
 raza shah khud german naziyon ko samarthan karne laga tha
 The Allies feared that Iran would go with Germany if they did not come forward
 sainik rup se iran bahut mahatvapurn tha kyonki yahan na sirf tel kaa bhandar tha balki yah bhugolic rup se asian soviet rus or british bharat ke bich padataa tha
 No German had spread military terror in Iran before the soviet-soviet disturbance
 cokeshas ke tel-kshetron par germany ne 1942 main hi dabaab bananaa aarambh kiya tha
 Although Raza Shah initially supported the Germans, he later turned against them seeing the future possibility of German suzerainty
 idhar hitler dwaara rus par akraman kar dene se rus tathaa britain mitra ho gaye the atah donon ne milakar iran kii satta par agast 1941 tak adhipaty kaayam kar liya
 In a way, Shah allowed all this to happen

 The German army also arrived in North Africa
 europe main germany ke kabje vaali zamin se rus-britain kaa sahyog hona band ho gaya to unhen iran ek nae raste ke rup main dikhne laga or unhone iran par agast 1941 tak adhikaar kar liya
 The Shah of Iran had at first described the role of an ally on the Nazis' aization but later he turned against the rule of the Nazis or the Communists, so he chose Britain as an auxiliary option
 shah ne apane putr mohammad raza ko vaaris banaakar gaddi chhod di or mitra raashtra yuddh ke khatm hone tak iran main bane rahe
 Due to the presence of British in Iran, the entire nation was looking at itself with shame
 sharmavanat raashtra ke gusse par tha - nae shah raza kaa shashan
 In 1949, there was a conspiracy to assassinate Shah, which failed
 pradhanmantri mosaddiq ko 60 ke dashak main sattapalat ke zurm main nazarkaid kii sazaa sunai gai or 1967 main uski mrityu ho gai
 He was a worthy person and even after this fate, the anger of the people was kindled against Shah

 Khomeini was born in 1902 in Khuman
 wo saiyyadon ke parivaar se the jo pigambar ke vanshaj maane jate hai
 During his childhood, parents were disconnected and he was educated in Qom
 iske falswaroop unke man main ulema ke prati aadar-bhav tha jo ki shah ke shasankaal main kam hota ja rahaa tha
 In 1963–64, he became one of the prominent leaders opposing Shah along with Mossadik
 tel ke kaaran shaharon main janajivan vilasita purna hota gaya or gaanv main garibi badhati gai
 This was also a reason for the people to become angry with the rule

 All the heads of state and their representatives were invited in it and there was immense expenditure in it

 The public's anger kept increasing

 People ditched pepsi-cola in western clothes
 darasal vahaan vilasita itani bad gai thi ki unka rahan-sahan europe ke logon se kahin behatar ho gaya tha
 After being deported by the government, Khomeini began to incite the Iranian public from abroad against the Shah
 kranti kii shuruyaat se pehle iran par shah raza pahalavi kii hukumat thi
 Power was limited to his close relatives and friends
 sattar ke dashak main iran main amiri or garibi ke bich kii khai apni charamasima par pahunch gai

 In ancient times Egyptians used to worship it as the moon god and believed in Khunsu
 sankramak rog, rog jo kisi naa kisi rogajanit karko jaise protozoa, kavak, jeevanu, virus ityadi ke kaaran hote he
 Infectious diseases have the ability to spread from one body to another
 malaria, typhoid, chechak, influenza ityadi sankramak rogon ke udhaaharan hai
 The World Health Organization has stated that infectious diseases are spreading faster than ever before and that it has become more difficult to treat them
 apni vaarshik vishwa swasthya report 2008 main raashtra sangh agency ne kaha he ki 1970 ke dashak se har saal ek yaa zyada nae rogon kaa pataa chal rahaa he, jo abhootpurv he
 The agency has said that efforts to control well-known diseases such as tuberculosis are also getting limited, as they are developing into more potent and resistant varieties of medicines
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne kaha he ki sankramak rogon ke prasar kaa kaaran pichley 50 varshon main antarrashtriya hawaii yatayaat main vruddhi he
 It has confirmed the spread of over 1,100 different diseases in the last 5 years alone
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne apane 193 sadasyon ko bimariyon ke failane ke bare main jaankaree dene or tike viksit karne main madad dene ke liye vishaanuon ke namoonon kaa aadan-pradaan karne main ek-duusare ke saath zyada sahyog karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Premature combating of diseases through vaccines and keeping them under control is a commendable progress achieved by humans in treating diseases
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan dwaara prakashit ek report ke anusaar abhi bhi vishwa main har saal lakhon bachche sankramak rogon ke shikaar ho rahe hai, lekin un main se bees lakh ko tikon ke jariye bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 We should first know what vaccine is
 china ke rajdhani shahar peiping ke rog nirodh centre ke visheshgy shri vu chyang ke anusaar tikaa vastav main kisi vishaanu kii processing ke aadhaar par viksit kiya gaya utpaada hota he
 By ingesting it into the human body through food or needle, the power of combating real viruses is created in the human body
 tikaa vishaanu se bilkul alag he, kyonki vishaanu lagane se rog paidaa hota he, par tike ke jariye sharir main rog kaa muqabla karne kii shakti paidaa hoti he
 In the year 1796, a British doctor was successful in treating smallpox by introducing a disease like cow pox in the human body such as the chicken pox
 is tarah maanav ne chechak ke tike kaa avishkaar kiya
 In 1980, the World Medical Organization announced the end of smallpox, which was the first disease to be eradicated through immunity
 us ke baad maanav ne lambe arase ke prayaason se anek rogon, jaise chechak, plig, kaali khaansee, rohinee, hanustambh, khasre or pagal kute ke rog ke tikon kaa utpaadan karne kii kshamta hasil kii
 Vaccination is given great importance in different countries because of the special role of vaccines in combating infectious diseases
 china main bhi yah kaary bahut pehle shuru ho gaya tha
 Vaccination is being given more and more importance in China, making rapid social and economic development and the work of vaccinating children has special importance
 china main rog pratirakshan kshamta badhaane kaa kaam yojananusaar kiya jaataa he
 In China, all children under seven years of age are vaccinated against diseases like polio, measles, jaundice, tuberculosis, whooping cough and Rohini
 iskaa mukhya kharch sarkaar uthaati he
 Children's parents spend very little on this
 1970 ke dashak se china main yah kaam shuru hone ke baad se baari pragati hui he
 Due to this, the immunization capacity of Chinese children was greatly improved
 chini ballrog visheshgy doctor hu yamei ke anusaar varsh 2003 main jab china sars se grast hua, tab bhi china main koi bhi baccha is rog kaa shikaar nahin bana
 Experts believe that the measles vaccine given to Chinese children gave them the power to combat SARS
 isiilie bahut kam chini bachche 2003 main sars ke shikaar hue
 No child died due to SARS
 pataa chalaa he ki 15 saal pehle hi china ne apane 15 pratishat bacchon ko tikaa lagane kaa lakshya puraa kar liya tha
 The United Nations Children's Fund, the World Medical Organization and the Chinese Ministry of Health jointly investigated this work and gave it a high evaluation
 tikon se china main khasre aadi sankramak rogon main bahut kami ai he
 For example, in the 1960s, the death rate from this fell from 2000 per lakh to 10
 china varsh 1960 main chechak kaa khaatmaa kar chukaa tha or varsh 2000 main usne polio kaa naash karne ke yuddh main vijay pai
 In addition to the five essential vaccines prescribed by the Chinese government, the Chinese people also have the facility to get their children vaccinated in hospitals for flu and jaundice, at their own expense
 bacchon ke alaava praudh log bhi vibhinn mausamon main utpann hone vaale sankramak rogon kii rokthaam ke liye aspataal main aavashyak tike lagava sakate hai
 It is also discussed here that dogs in China are more than enough, so people need to be vaccinated against the disease of mad dogs
 naye sankramak rogon kaa muqabla karne ke liye ab chini visheshgy naye tikon kaa anusandhan kar rahe hai
 Dr
 Ho Shung, expert of the Chinese Disease Prevention Society, says that Chinese experts are engaged in the invention of many new vaccines
 tikon ke jariye aids, cancer or kuch puraane gambhir rogon kaa muqabla karne kii bhi badi sambhaavna he
 Therefore, efforts being made in this context will not be meaningless

 vishwa kii saatvin sabase badi arthvyavastha, duusari sabase badi jansankhya, sabase bade loktantr or vishwa kii teesri sabase badi sainya balon samet ek parmaanu-shastr rajya ke netaa hone ke kaaran bhartiya pradhanmantri ko vishwa ke sabase shaktishaalee or prabhaavshaalee vyaktiyon main gina jaataa he
 In 2010, Forbes magazine placed the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at number 18 on its list of the world's most powerful people, and placed him 19th and 28th respectively in 2012 and 2013
 unke uttaradhikari, narendra modi ko varsh 2014 main 15wein sthaan par tathaa varsh 2015 main vishwa kaa 9vaan sabase shaktishaalee vyakti namit kiya tha

 The post of Prime Minister is undoubtedly the most powerful and dominant post in the Indian political system
 sangheey sarkaar tathaa kendriya mantrimandal kii sari gatividhiyon va nitiyon par antytah niyantran pradhanmantri ke paas hi hota he
 The Prime Ministers also ultimately appoint and expel Union Ministers
 haalaanki, mantriyon kii niyukti, nishkasana va anya aise kaary pradhanmantri swayan nahin kar sakate he
 The appointment and removal of ministers is done by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister
 bhartiya samvidhan kramshah aise kai vidhaan preshit karata he, jinke dwaara vaidhik rup se yah sunishchit kiya gaya he ki saamaanya halaaton main, karypalika ke maamle main raashtrapati par keval nammaatr shaktiyaan nihit hon, jabaki vaastavik shaktiyaan pradhanmantri ke haathon main ho
 The powers of the Prime Minister and the President have been mentioned in the various Articles of Part 5 in the Constitution as follows: saadharantah, pradhanmantri ko sansadeey aam chunaav ke parinaam ke aadhaar par raashtrapati dwaara niyukt kiya jaataa he
 The Prime Minister is the leader of the majority-party in the Lok Sabha
 haalaanki, pradhanmantri kaa swayan loksabhaa saansad hona anivaary nahin he parantu unhen loksabhaa main bahumat siddh karnaa hota he or niyukti ke chah maheenon ke bheetar hi sansad kaa sadsy bananaa padataa he
 The Prime Minister can be a member of either of the two houses of Parliament
 aitihaasik taur par aise kai pradhanmantri hue hai, joki rajyasabha -saansad the; 1966 main indira gandhi, devgauda or haal hi main manmohan singh, rajyasabha-saansad the
 After each election, after the election of the leader of the majority of the pulses in the meeting of the new assembly, the President invites the leader of the majority party to become the Prime Minister, after accepting the invitation, the person concerned receives a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha it happens

 If any one party or coalition is unable to obtain a majority in the Lok Sabha, then it is entirely up to the discretion of His Excellency the President to decide who to invite to get the Prime Minister
 aisi sthiti ko trishanku sabha kii sthiti kaha jaataa he
 In the event of a hung assembly, the President usually invites the leader of the largest party to prove his majority in the following
 nimantran sweekaar karne vaale vyakti kaa loksabhaa main vishwasamat siddh karnaa anivaary he or uske baad hi vah vyakti pradhanmantri niyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Historically, various presidents have used this privilege on several occasions
 varsh 1977 main raashtrapati neelam sanjeev reddy ne pradhanmantri morarji desai ke istife ke pashchaat, choudhary charan singh ko isi visheshadhikaar kaa prayog kar, pradhanmantri niyukt kiya tha

 cabinet, pradhanmantri dwaara chaynit or raashtrapati dwaara niyukt mantriyon se bana hota he
 The Constitution of India does not specify any special qualifications for the post of Prime Minister
 parantu ek aavashyakta zarur nirdhaarit kii gai he: pradhanmantri ke paas loksabhaa athwa rajyasabha kii sadsyta honi chahie, or unke paas loksabhaa main bahumat kaa samarthan hona chaiye
 If at the time of appointment, the eligible person is not a member of either of the two houses of the Indian Parliament, then it is mandatory for him to get the membership of Parliament within 6 months of the appointment otherwise his prime ministership will be rejected
 atah pradhanmantritv ke daavedaar ke paas, ek saansad hone kii sari arhataayen hona chaiye
 The 84th Article of the Fifth Part of the Indian Constitution specifies the qualifications of an MP, according to: koi vyakti sansad ke kisi sthaan ko bharne ke liye chune jane ke liye arhit tabhi hoga jab— As specified in the third point, the eligible will have to live up to any eligibility of eligibility passed by the Parliament in future and since the Prime Minister is mandatory to be an MP, the Prime Minister's eligible to be eligible to be a member of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, some other Qualifications also have to be met, including a person with a distorted character or not being declared insolvent, voluntarily

 saath hi, paatr kaa, kendriya sarkaar, kisi bhi rajya sarkaar athwa purvakthith kisi bhi sarkaar ke adheen kisi bhi karyaalay tathaa prashasnic yaa gaiyr-prashasnic nikaay kii seva main kisi bhi laabhakaari pad kaa karmchaaree nahin hona chahie
 Also, the membership of the eligible is also terminated by the motion-approved expulsion from the House
 niyukti ke pashchaat, inamen se, purvakthith kisi bhi arhataaon par, pradhanmantri kii ayogyata, kisi vidhik nyaayalay main siddh kii jaati he, to, us vyakti kaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya jaataa he, or use pradhanmantri ke pad se nishkasit kar diya jaataa he
 The oath of office to the Prime Minister is administered by the President
 pad par niyukti hetu, bhavi padaadhikari ko do shapath lene kii anivaaryta he
 Both these oaths are specified in the Third Schedule of the Indian Constitution, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 and 219): shapath yaa pratigyaan ke praroop: Format of 1 Ministerial Oath: 2 gopneeyata kii shapath kaa praroop : In principle, the incumbent Prime Minister, "president of the Presidency", holds office
 raashtrapatipad ke vipareet, pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal ke liye koi kaal-seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he
 Therefore, a sitting Prime Minister can remain on the Prime Minister indefinitely, provided that the President has "confidence" in him
 iskaa vaastavik arth yah he kii ek vyakti keval tab tak pradhanmantri pad par bana rah saktaa he, jabatak loksabhaa main bahumat kaa vishwash uske paksh main he
 However, the full term of the Lok Sabha is 5 years, after which new elections are held, and the new assembly again passes a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister, if the newly elected assembly declares a distrust in the Prime Minister, then the term of the Prime Minister ends
 it happens
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri kaa ek puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh kaa hota he, jiske baad uski punahsamiksha hoti he
 However, the term of the Prime Minister can be terminated before 5 years, if due to any reason, pass a no-confidence vote against the Lok Sabha Government or if for any reason, the Prime Minister's membership of the Parliament is declared void, the Prime Minister may, at any time, The resignation of office can be done by handing over a written resignation to the President
 pradhanmantri morarji desai desh ke pehle pradhanmantri the, jinhone kaarykaal ke bich apana pad tyaag diya tha
 There is no time limit on the tenure of the Prime Minister nor any age limit has been specified
 bharat praveshdwar Article 74 of the Constitution of India expressly requires the presence of the Prime Minister to preside over and run the Council of Ministers
 uski mrityu yaa tyaagptr kii dasha me samast parishad ko pad chhodna pasta he
 He alone constitutes the Council of Ministers
 raashtrapati mantrigan kii niyukti uski salaah se hi karte hai
 The Department of Minister's Department also determines the same
 cabinet ke kaary kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 He also gives instructions to the administration of the country
 sabhi nitigat nirnay vahi letaa he
 The link between the President and the Council of Ministers is also the same
 mantriparishad kaa pradhan pravaktaa bhi vahi he
 He leads parliamentary debates in the name of the council
 sansad me parishad ke paksh me ladi ja rahi kisi bhi bahes me vah bhaag le saktaa he
 The coordination between the minister also does the same
 vah kisi bhi mantralay se koi bhi soochna mangava saktaa he
 Due to all these reasons, the Prime Minister is considered the most important political personality of India
 bhartiya pradhanmantripad ke varchasv va mahatv kaa sabase ahm kaaran he, uske padaadhikari ko pradaan kii gai kaaryakari shaktiyaan
 Article 74 of the Constitution establishes the office of Prime Minister, and specifies that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the head, who shall provide "advice and assistance" to the President of India
 tathaa anuchhed 75 yah sthapit karata he keemntriyon kii niyukti, raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar kii jaayegi, evam mantri ko vibhinn kaarybhaar bhi raashtrapati, pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar hi denge
 Therefore, the constitution specifies that where the President of India has constitutional executive authority, but because the President of India only acts in favor of the Prime Minister in these relations, in reality, the Prime Minister exercises these executive powers as he wishes
 
 in vidhaanon dwaara samvidhan yah sthapit karata he, kii bharat ke rashtrapramukh hone ke naate, raashtrapati par nihit saare kaaryakari adhikaar, apratyaksh rup se, pradhanmantri hi kiya karenge, tathaa sampurna mantriparishad ke pradhan honge tathaa anuchhed 75 dwaara mantriparishad kaa gathan, mantriyon kii niyukti evam unka kaarybhaar saunpna bhi pradhanmantri kii ichha par chhod diya gaya he, balki mantriyon or mantralayon ke sambandh main samvidhan, pradhanmantri ko puri khuli chhot pradaan karata he
 The Prime Minister can include, remove, appoint or suspend any person in his cabinet
 kyonki mantriyon kii niyukti raashtrapati dwaara keval pradhanmantri kii salaah par hoti he, atah iskaa arth yah he kii kendriya mantriparishad vaastavik rup se pradhanmantri kii pasand ke logon dwaara nirmit hoti he, jisamen ve apni pasandanusaar kabhi bhi pher-badal kar sakate he
 At the same time, giving various duties to ministers also depends entirely on the will of the Prime Minister; She can assign any ministry or assignment to any of her ministers, take away or assign any other charge / ministry
 in maamlo main sambandhit mantriyon se salaah-mashwara karne kii, yaa unki anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii koi sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 Rather, there is no constitutional obligation of any kind on the Prime Minister to obtain the advice or permission of the Minister or Ministers concerned in any of the foregoing matters regarding Ministers and Ministries
 ve kabhi bhi apni icchaanusaar, kisi bhi mantri ko mantripad se istifa dene ke liye bhi kah sakate he, or yadi vah mantri, istifa dene se inkaar kar detaa he, to ve raashtrapati se kah kar use pad se nilambit bhi karvaa sakate hai
 Apart from the appointment of ministers and allocation of ministries, the Prime Minister also has full control over the cabinet meetings, the activities of the cabinet and the policies of the government
 pradhanmantri, mantriparishad ke sanvaidhanik pramukh evam netaa hote hai
 He represents the Council of Ministers in Parliament and other forums
 ve mantrimandaleey sabhaaon kii adhyakshata karte hai, tathaa in baithkon kii kaarysoochee, tathaa charchaa ke anya vishay wo hi tay karte hai
 Rather, all matters and content that arise in cabinet meetings are determined with the approval and consent of the Prime Minister
 cabinet kii baithkon main uthne vaale vibhinn prastaavon ko manzur yaa naamanzur karnaa, pradhanmantri kii ichha par hota he
 Although every Minister is at liberty to discuss and put his personal suggestions and proposals before the meeting, but ultimately the same proposal or decision is taken which is agreed upon by the Prime Minister and after the decision is passed, the final decision of the entire Council of Ministers
 Supposedly, and all ministers have to follow up with that decision of the Prime Minister
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he kii sanvaidhanik rupatah, kendriya mantrimandal par pradhanmantri ko purna niyantran va chunautihin prabhutv hasil he
 In the matter of control, the Prime Minister is the surveyor of the Council of Ministers, and with his resignation, the entire government collapses, meaning that all ministers lose their ministership
 mantriparishad kii adhyakshata ke alaava samvidhan, pradhanmantri par ek or khaas visheshadhikaar nihit karata he, yah visheshadhikaar he mantriparishad or raashtrapati ke bich kaa madhyasampark sutara hona
 This privilege is only given to the Prime Minister, through which the Prime Minister, from time to time, keeps the President notified of the information related to decisions and discussions to be taken in the Council of Ministers
 pradhanmantri ke alaava koi bhi anya mantri, swechha se mantrisabha main charchit kisi bhi vishay ko raashtrapati ke samaksh udghaatit nahin kar saktaa he
 The importance and meaning of this privilege is that the Prime Minister also has the right to decide which of the topics discussed in the cabinet meetings is to be kept confidential, and which information should be presented to the world
 pradhanmantri, rajya ke vibhinn angon ke mukhya prabandhak ke rup main kaary karte he, jiskaa kaary, rajya ke saare vibhaagon va angon se, apni icchaanusaar kaary karwaanaa he
 They also have to coordinate between different departments and ministries of the government, and implement decisions taken by the cabinet and direct various departments
 mantralayon or vibhaagon ke bich ke prashasnic matbhed sulajhana or antim nirnay lenaa bhi unka kaam he
 In addition to the implementation of government functions, the Prime Minister has a great influence and hold over the government machinery
 shashan va sarkaar ke pramukh hone ke naate, kaaryakarini kii tamaam niyuktiyaan vaastavik taurapar pradhanmantri dwaara kii jaati he
 All high-level officers and officials appoint the Prime Minister of their choice
 in niyuktiyon main, ucch-salaahkaaron tathaa sarkari mantralayon or karyaalayon ke ucchadhikari samet, vibhinn rajyon ke rajyapal, mahanyaywaadee, mahalekhapareekshak, lok seva ayog ke adhipati, va anya sadsy, vibhinn deshon ke rajdoot, vaanijyadoot ityadi, sab shaamil hai
 All these high level appointments are made by the President of India, on the advice of the Prime Minister
 sarkaar or mantriparishad ke pramukh hone ke naate, pradhanmantri loksabhaa main bahumat or sattapaksh ke netaa or pramukh pratinidhi hai
 In this context, it is considered the duty of the Prime Minister to represent the government and the ruling party in the House
 saath hi yah aashaa kii jaati he ki sadan main sarkaar dwaara liye gaye mahatvapurn vidheyak or ghoshnaayen pradhanmantri karenge tathaa un mahatvapurn nirnyon ke vishay main sattapaksh kii taraf se pradhanmantri uttar denge
 The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by election, so generally, the Speaker also has a majority of pulses
 atah, bahumat daal ke netaa hone ke naate, sabhapati ke zariye, pradhanmantri, loksabhaa kii karrwai ko bhi simitroop se prabhavit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai, kyonki sabhapati, sabha kaa adhishthata hota he, or sadan main charchaa kii vishaysoochee bhi sabhapati hi nirdhaarit karata he, haalaanki sadan kii karrwai ko adhik had tak prabhavit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from these duties, the Prime Minister has the most important power over parliamentary action, the power to convene and end the Lok Sabha session
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 85, loksabhaa ke satr bulaane or satrant karne kaa adhikaar, bharat ke raashtrapati ko detaa he, parantu is maamle raashtrapati ko pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar kaary karnaa padataa he
 That is to say, it is in the hands of the Prime Minister to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha
 yah adhikaar, nihsandeh, pradhanmantri ke haathon main di gayi sabase mahatvapurn adhikaar he, joki unako na keval apane dal par, balki vipaksh ke saansadon kii gatividhiyon par bhi simit niyantran kaa avasar pradaan karata he
