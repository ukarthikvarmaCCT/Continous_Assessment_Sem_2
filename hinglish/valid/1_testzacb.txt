 Although Turkey accepted the League of Nations arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the League's decision to question the authority of the Council

 The majority of the population of the city of Vilnius was Polish during the war era, and on 9 October 1920 General Jeligowski took over the city with a Polish army force, claiming that the central government of Lithuania was now under him

 The Polish government indicated that they would obey the Union, but instead of leaving, it strengthened the city with more Polish troops

 Agreed to support the League's plan for the region, remove the Polish troops, and cooperate with the referendum
 The League, however, now faced opposition from Lithuania and the Soviet Union, which had opposed any international force in Lithuania
 The League canceled the referendum and plans made for international force in March 1921 and came back to resolve the issue through negotiations between the two parties

 Following allegations of forced labor in the us-owned Firestone Rubber Plantation and US allegations of slave trade, the Liberian government asked the United Nations to launch an investigation
 The commission constituted for the investigation was jointly appointed by the Union, the United States and Liberia
 1930 main, sangh kii ek report main pushti kii gai ki das pratha tathaa jabaran mazdooree prachlit thi
 The report found many government officials involved in the sale of bonded laborers and recommended that they be replaced by European or American ones
 The Liberian government outlawed slavery and forced labor and sought US assistance, a move that provoked anger inside Liberia resulting in President Charles DB King and his vice-president resigning
 The League then threatened that a trusteeship would be established on Liberia until the reforms were implemented
 President Edwin Barkley's focus shifted to implementing these reforms
 mukden kaa haadasa, jise "manchurion haadasa" yaa "sudur purvi sankat" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa hai, sangh kii badi asafalataaon main se ek tha, jisane sanghathan se japan kii vaapasi ke liye utprerak ke rup main kaam kiya
 Subject to the terms of an agreed lease, the Japanese government was empowered to deploy its forces to the surrounding areas of the Southern Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between the two countries through the Chinese territory of Manchuria
 Was
 san 1931 ke sitambar main manchuriya ke ek akraman ke bahaane japani kwangtung sena ke adhikariyon or sainikon ke ek dal ne railway ke kuch bhaag ko thoda kshatigrast kar diya
 However, Japanese soldiers claimed that the railway had been demolished by Chinese troops and in apparent retaliation occupied the entire territory of Manchuria
 unhone is kshetra kaa namakaran manchuko kiya or 9 march 1932, ko ek kathputli sarkaar china ke purv maharaja pu yi ke netritv main sthapit kii
 Internationally, this new country was recognized only by the governments of Italy and Germany, while the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China
 san 1932 main, japan kii vaayu or jal sena ne china ke shanghai shahar par bamavarsha kii, jisane 28 janvari kii ghatana ko chingaari pradaan kiya
 The League of Nations agreed to request the Chinese government, but the long sea voyage caused the members of the union to delay investigating the case

 Despite Japan's high reach in the Union, the report presented by Litton proved Japan aggressive and demanded that Manchuria be returned to China
 Before the report was voted on by the Legislative Assembly, Japan announced its intention to move forward in China
 san 1933 main report vidhansabha main 42-1 ke bahumat se paarit hui, parantu china se apni sena hataane ke bajaay, japan ne sangh se apni sadsyta waapas le lee
 According to the manifesto, the United Nations should have responded by imposing economic sanctions on Japan, or should have gathered the military and declared war against it
 haalanki inamen se koi bhi kaarywahi kii nahin gai
 The threat of an economic embargo became almost useless because the United States was not a UN member
 kisi bhi prakaar kaa aarthik pratibandh sangh apane sadsy rajyon par aropit karata tha vah aprabhavi ho jaataa tha, kyonki jab ek sadsy raashtra ko dusre sadsy raashtra ke saath vyapaar karne ke liye pratibandhit kiya jaataa tha to vah sanyukt rajya america ke saath vyapaarik sambandh sthapit kar letaa tha
 The League of Nations could gather an army, but major powers such as Britain and France were also complicit in their own affairs, such as control of their vast empire, especially after the upheavals of the First World War
 Manchuria was therefore left under Japanese control until the Soviet Union's Red Army captured the area and returned it to China after World War II
 raashtra sangh san 1932 main bolivia or paragway ke madhya dakshini america ke shushk gran chaako kshetra ko lekar hue yuddh ko rokane main naakaam rahaa

 In October 1935, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini sent 400,000 troops to invade Abyssinia
 Marshal Pietro Badoglio led the campaign from November 1935

 The modern Italian army easily defeated the extremely backward Abyssinia army and, in May 1936, captured Addis Ababa, forcing Emperor Hale Selassie to flee

 First on October 5, and later on July 4, 1936, the United States achieved unprecedented success in its efforts and raised the export of oil and other materials to the level of general peacetime

 In December of 1935, the hoare-lavelle Treaty was an attempt by British Foreign Minister Samuel Hoare and French Prime Minister Pierre Lavelle to end the conflict in Abyssinia, which proposed to divide the country into two parts - an Italian territory and An Abyssinia region
 Mussolini agreed to the treaty, but news of the deal was leaked, as a result the French and British public strongly opposed it and called the treaty an offer to sell Abyssinia
 Hoare and Lavelle were forced to resign from their posts and both the British and French governments separated from their respective peoples

 The situation was the same with Japan, the major powers' enthusiasm in dealing with the crisis of Abyssinia was not due to their belief that the fate of this poor and remote country which was inhabited by non-europeans could not be the subject of their central interest
 Huh

 On 17 July 1936, the Spanish Army began a state-uprising, leading to a long-term armed conflict between the Spanish Republicans and the nationalists

 Union members, however, neither interfered in the Spanish Civil War nor prevented foreign intervention
 Hitler and Mussolini continued their support of General Francisco Franco's nationalist rebels and the Soviet Union supported the Spanish republicans

 The Allies were also bound by the Treaty of Versailles to try to disarm and the arms embargo that was imposed on the defeated nations was described as the first attempt towards worldwide disarmament
 sangh prasanvida ne sangh ko prayek rajya ke liye ek nirsreekaran yojana taiyaar karne ke liye nirdisht kiya parantu parishad ne is jimmedaari ko 1926 main gathit vishesh ayog ko 1932-34 ke vishwa nirastrikaran sammelan kii taiyaari karne ke liye saunp diya
 The members of the Sangh had different views on disarmament
 francisi apane shastron ko is guarantee ke bina kam karne ke liye anicchhuk the ki unpar akraman hone par sainik sahaayta mili
 Poland and Czechoslovakia felt insecure on the west side and wanted the members to be strengthened before aggressive action by the union and disarming them
 Without this guarantee, they would not reduce their weapons because they felt that the threat of invasion from Germany was too high

 The last important function of the Union was the suspension of the Soviet Union in December 1939 when it invaded Finland
 xxrep 4 - Cartoon from Punch magazine, 10 December 1920, ridiculed the space left by the US when it did not join the League of Nations

 is asafalat ke liye vividh kaarak jimmevaar the, jisamen bahut sara sanghathan ke bheetar ke saamaanya kamajoriyon se judaa tha
 Additionally, the US refusal to join the union limited the power of the organization

 It also tied the Union to the Treaty of Versailles, so that when the treaty became indistinct and unpopular, it also reflected in the League of Nations
 sangh kii tathakthith tatasthta ne ise anirnay ke rup main abhivyakt kiya
 It required a unanimous vote of its nine members, later fifteen council members, to pass an act; Therefore, decisive and effective work was difficult, if not impossible
 yah apane nirnyon par aane main dhimaa bhi tha kyonki kuch nirnyon main sampurna sabha kii sarvasammat manjuuri aavashyak thi
 This problem stemmed mainly from the fact that the main members of the League of Nations were not prepared to accept the possibility that their destiny would be decided by other countries and therefore, consequently, gave themselves the power to veto by implementing a unanimous vote
 sangh main pratinidhitiv aksar ek samasya thi
 Although it intended to include all nations, many never joined, or their partnership with the Union was too small

 Ruth Henning suggested that if the US had been a member of the Union, it would have supported France and Britain as well, presumably France would have felt more secure and such encouragement would have allowed France and Britain to cooperate more with Germany and this would lead to Nazi The rise of the party would have been less possible

 The structure of government in the US would have also made its membership problematic because its representatives in the Union would not have taken any decision on behalf of the American executive branches without the prior approval of its legislative branches

 The collective security system that the Union used meant that nations were required to act against states they considered friendly and in this way support states that had no general intimacy with their national interests
 There may be danger

 On 23 June 1936, unsuccessful in the League's efforts to stop Italy's war campaign against Abyssinia, British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin said in the House of Commons that collective security antat, britain evam france donon ne adolf hitler ke adheen german sainikwaad ke badhate prabhaav ke kaaran tushtikaran ke paksh main samuhik suraksha kiadharna ko tyaag diya

 Foreign Office Minister Sir Eyre Crowe also wrote a memorandum to the British Cabinet claiming that "a serious union and contract" would be just " a treaty like other treaties": "what is there to ensure that It won't break like other treaties? "
 Crowe expressed skepticism about the "pledge of common action" against the invaders because he believed that individual states' actions would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power
 He criticized the union's proposal for economic sanctions because it would be ineffective and was "a question of genuine military prominence"
 Crowe warned that universal disarmament was a practical impossibility

 The last meeting of the Union of Nations was held on 12 April 1946 in Geneva
 34 deshon ke pratinidhiyon ne sadan main bhaag liya
 This session concerned the liquefaction of the Union itself: in 1946 approximately $ 22,000,000 worth of property was given to the United States, including the Palace of Peace and the Archives of the Union, the reserves were returned to the countries that supplied them and Union debt was repaid

 Jarasandha was the king of the kingdom of Mahabharata, Magadha
 vah bahut hi shaktishaalee raja tha or uskaa sapana chakravati samraat banane kaa tha
 Although he was a powerful king, he was very cruel
 ajey ho k apana sapana puraa karne ke liye usne bahut se raajaaon ko apane karagaar main bandi banaakar rakhaa tha
 He was the father-in-law and supreme friend of Yaduvanshi Naresh Kansa of Mathura
 Both his daughters Asit and Pramit were married to Kansa
 shrikrishna se kansa vadh kaa pratishodh lene ke liye usne 17 baar mathura par chadhaai kii lekin har baar use asafal hona padaa
 Jarasandha was Sri Krishna's ultimate enemy and a warrior
 jaraasandh ke pita the magadhanaresh maharaj brihadrath or unki do patraniyaan thi
 He wanted both of them to be the same
 bahut samay vyateet ho gaya or ve buudhe ho chale the, lekin unki koi santan nahin thi
 Then once he heard that the sage Chandkaushik was in his kingdom and he is sitting under a mango tree
 yah sunate hi rajan ashapurna hokar rishi se milane chal die
 Reaching the sage, he told the sage his sorrow
 raja kaa vrutant sunakar rishi ko dayaa aa gai or unhone naresh ko ek aam diya or kaha kii ise apni rani ko khilaa dena
 But since he had two wives and loved them equally, he fed them to their two queens in equal pieces of that mango
 isse dono raniyon ko aadhe-aadhe putr hue
 In fear, they threw both of them into the forest
 tabhi vahaan se jaraa naamak ek rakshasi bhi ja rahi thi
 He saw those two carcasses of meat and he took the right carcass in the right hand and the left carcass in the left hand, adding both the pieces
 judate hi us balak ne bahut jor kii garjana kii jisase bhaybheet hokar jaraa rakshasi bhaag gai or rajbhavan main donon raniyon kii chaati se dudh utar aayaa
 That's why his name was Jarasandha
 is prakaar jaraasandh kaa janm hua
 After the completion of the construction of Indraprastha city, one day Narada Muni conveyed his father's message to Maharaja Yudhishthira that he should perform Rajasuya Yajna
 is vishay par maharaj ne shrikrishna se baat kii to unhone bhi yudhisthir ko rajasuya yajna karne ke liye protsaahit kiya, lekin maharaj yudhisthir ke chakravarti samraat banane ke maarg main keval ek roda tha, magadh naresh jaraasandh, jise parrast kiye bina vah samraat nahin ban sakate the or naa hi use ranbhumi me parrast kiya ja saktaa tha
 To solve this problem, along with Shri Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna, they disguised themselves as Brahmins and headed towards Magadha
 vahaan pahunch kar jaraasandh ne unhen brahman samajhakar kuch maang lene ke liye kaha lakin us samay brahman bheshadhari shrikrishna ne kaha kii abhi unke dono mitron kaa maun vrath he jo ardh raatri main samaapt hoga
 Then Jarasandha promised to come only at midnight and put him in the Brahmin room
 tab ardharatri main vah aayaa lekin use un teenon par kuch andeh hua kii ve brahman nahin he kayoki ve sharir se kshatriya jaise lag rahe the usne apane andeh ko prakat kiya or unhe unke vaastavik rup main aane ko kaha evm unhe pahchaan liya
 Then he got angry after hearing the goodness of Shri Krishna and asked him to take whatever he wanted and go away from here
 tab unhone brahman bhesh main hi jaraasandh ko mallayuddh karne ke liye kaha or phir apana vaastavik parichay diya
 Jarasamgh was a brave warrior, so he chose Bhima for the Malla war
 tab agle usne bhim ke saath mallbhumi main mall yuddh kiya
 This war lasted for about 28 days but he would rejoin each time Bhimsen broke it in two
 is par shrikrishna ne ghaas kii ek tandi kii sahaayta se bhim ko sanket kiya kii is baar vah uske tukade kar ke donon tukade alag-alag disha main phenke
 Then Bhima did the same and thus Jarasandha was killed
 tab uskaa vadh karke un teenon ne uske bandigrih main band sabhi 86 raajaaon ko mukt kiya or shrikrishna ne jaraasandh ke putr sahadev ko raja banaaya

 The focal point of ancient Indian diplomatic thought was the king, so often all political thinkers - Kautilya, Manu, Ashwaghosh, Brihaspati, Bhishma, Visakhadatta etc
 have described the duties of kings

 to achieve his goal

 Thus, since ancient times, Indian diplomacy has a special place
 pracheen bharat main vibhinn dharm granthon main rajnay se sambandhit uplabdh saamagree kaa varnan is prakaar he :- Manusmriti, written on human religion, is one of the oldest work of India in which detailed description of ambassadors and their works is available
 manu ke dwaara diye gayi niyamon main padosi deshon ke saath raajnneetik sambandhon ko banaaye rakhane ke liye rajdoot kii niyukti kaa praavdhaan tha
 He gave great importance to the ambassador
 raja ko keval aise vyakti ko hi rajdoot niyukt karnaa chaiye jo sabhi vishyon kaa gyaata ho, jo dusron ke mukh par aaye bhaavon ko pard sake tathaa jo satyawadee, guni or ucch vansh kaa ho
 Manu emphasizes the appointment of an ambassador for a person who is a scholar of all the scriptures, has a good personality, abstains from smoking and drinking and is of a clever and noble family
 manu ke anusaar, Manu is of the opinion that a qualified and clever ambassador is successful in establishing differences between friendly states and friendship between enemy states
 manu raja ko yuddh ke prayog kaa paraamarsh, yuddh kii anivaaryta tathaa vijay kii sunishchitata kii sthiti main ek antim shastr ke rup main hi dete hai
 Since the outcome of the war is uncertain, Manu advises the king that he should never allow a friend, enemy or neutral kingdom to become more powerful than himself
 rajya kii raksha tathaa shatru kaa vinaash rajya kaa pramukh kartavya he
 It is the king's religion to fight the enemy
 vah use shatru ke sarvanaash ke liye bagule kii bhaanti vyavhaar kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 In addition, the king should be powerful like a lion and clever like a fox
 manu ne rajyon kii videsh niti ke bare main vistaar se varnan kiya he
 The fundamental principle of Manu is the Shadgunya Mantra, in which he advises the king to accept the qualities of Sandhi, Deity, Yan, Asana, Duality and Sambhava
 isi ke madhyam se raja suchnaayen ekatrit karata tha
 In Manu's opinion, the messenger had three main tasks - but to declare war or peace with the king, make treaties and work abroad
 rajdoot ko apane guptcharon ke madhyam se apana gyanavardhan karnaa chaiye tathaa virdohi paksh ke lobhi vyaktiyon va adhikariyon ko bhrasht karne kaa nirantar prayaas karte rahanaa chaiye
 Manu advises on getting information by giving temptation and offering
 vastav main pracheen kaal main guptchar va guptchari kaa virodh na karke, uske upyog par bal diya gaya tha
 In Yajnavalkya Smriti, protecting the state and subjects is considered to be the prime duty of the king
 atah yuddh karnaa raja kaa dharm he
 The king should adopt his own policy keeping this situation in mind and should achieve success by using all measures like material, charity, distinction and punishment
 yajyavlky smriti ke ek shloke main raja ke gun sandhi, vigrah, yaan, asana, sanshray or dwadhibhav bataaye gayi hai, arthath raja ko aavashyaktaa tathaa paristhiti anusaar apane padosi rajyon ke saath mitrataa, shatruta, akraman, upeksha, sangrakshan athwa foot daalane kaa praytn karnaa chaiye
 Ramayana and Mahabharata are masterpieces compared to the oldest epics of world literature
 inamen rajnay kii upyogita va unmuktiyon se sambandhit udhaaharan milte he
 In the Ramayana composed by Maharishi Balmiki, before Ram declared war against Lanka, Angad made a full effort to compromise according to the policy
 ravan dwaara hanuman ke lanka dahan ke kaaran prandand ke aadesh dene par ravan ke bhai vibhishana ne vyavdhaan daalate hue kaha tha ki shastranusaar doot kaa vadh niti virdohi he, use dandit nahin kiya ja saktaa, chaahe vah kaisaa hi aparaadh kyon na kare
 Doing Vibhishan in your favor and getting information about the activities in Ravana's court is a sign of skilled diplomatic qualification
 shuk rakshas dwaara ram kii sena kaa bhed pataa lagane ke liye aane par use pakad liya gaya, parantu ram ne use chhod diya kyonki shuk ne apane ko ravan kaa doot ghoshit kar diya tha
 Thus, it was the practice of sending messengers during this period and their main task was to bring, carry and spy on messages
 ayodhya kand main raja dasharath ram ko paraamarsh dete hai ki raja ko duuton ke madhyam se satya kaa pataa lagane kaa praytn karnaa chaiye
 Tulsidas has described the four measures of Sama, charity, distinction and punishment in the Ramcharit Manas
 mahabharat hamaare pracheen raajnneetik evam saanskrithik itihaas ke adhyayan kaa ek pramukh saadhan he
 Like the Ramayana, the Mahabharata was also a book of ethics in which the king could study to protect the interests of his own kingdom
 gita ko vidwaanon ne nitishastra, niti mimasaa, kartavya shaastra aadi anek naam diye hai
 The teachings of the Gita are seen as the highest ideals of politics
 is samay tak rajnay viksit ho chukaa tha
 The description of messengers is found in Mahabharata
 shashan kii safalataa ke liye duuton or guptcharon kii aavashyaktaa par isamen bal diya gaya he
 The messenger could be appointed only by a person who is of noble lineage, is a dear orator, has a good memory and is justified
 shantiparv main varnit he ki duuton ke madhyam se rajya ko apane shatru or mitra donon hi pakshon ke abhilashit vishay kaa gyaan praapt kar lenaa chaiye
 Sanjan acted as an envoy on various occasions
 pandavon kii ore se shrikrishna ek vishesh doot banakar kauravon ke raja duryodhana ke darbar main donon pakshon ke madhya samjhauta karaane gayi the, jisase ki bhavishya main sangram na ho
 Sri Krishna was replete with diplomacy when asked about the appropriateness of such impossible work by Draupadi
 shrikrishna kaa mat tha ki bhale hi ve yuddh ko taalane main asafal rahe, parantu ve vishwa ko dikhaa denge ki ve nyyochit hai tathaa kaurav anyaay kar rahe hai
 In this context, he said that- is sandarbh main shrikrishna ne kaha tha ki “dhashtarashtran ke samaksh main na keval apane parantu kauravon ke hiton kii bhi raksha karuunga
 " yudhniti evam raajnneeti ke krishna ek mahaan gyaata the
 The policy discourse given to Dharmaraja Yudhishthira and Arjuna signifies to be a worthy and ideal ambassador of Krishna
 bhishma pitamah ne doot kii yogyataon kaa varnan kiya he
 According to him, a man who is skilled, dear-speaking, rationalist and with good memory can be appointed the same messenger
 raja ko kisi bhi paristhiti main doot kaa vadh nahin karchaa chaiye
 "the messenger will be hellbent on including the ministers
 " bhishma pitamah dwaara antim kshanon main diye gayi vachan raja tathaa rajnay par acha prakaash daalate hai
 The Mahabharata supports the use of all kinds of means in achieving higher attainment
 shantiparv rajnay or yuddh va shaanti ke paraamarsh se bharaa padaa he
 In Vanaparva, all the means to achieve victory are said to be valid
 kshatriya dharm naitikta ke upar tathaa pare he
 Both these epics are important texts written on governance, diplomacy, war and peace
 is prakaar ramayana or mahabharat kaal main rajnay kaa sansthagat swaroop ubhar aayaa tha
 According to Ramchandra Dixitar, diplomacy was fully developed by this time
 maury kaal bhartiya rajnay kaa swarnakaal kaha ja saktaa he
 During this period, the practice of sending messengers had become a part of international relations
 antarraji sambandhon ke saath-saath anterrashtriya sambandh bhi viksit ho chuke the
 The messengers were exchanged permanently and temporarily
 chandragupta maury ke darbar main magasthanij or samudragupta ke darbar main sinhal raja ke doot aaye the
 Similarly, messengers were sent from India to China and Rome
 in duuton kaa kaary mularoop se vyapaarik suvidhaayen praapt karnaa tha
 The appointment of messengers abroad is also described in Rajatarangini
 magasthanij kii pustak 'indika' main mauryalin bharat kii raajnneetik dashaon kaa varnan he
 During the reign of Bindusara, King Antiochus of Syria sent a man named Dymekus and Egyptian King Ptolemy sent Dionysius as his messenger
 samraat ashok ne lanka, misr, syria, macidon aadi deshon ke saath sambandh sthapit kiye the tathaa apane putr mahendra va putree sanghmitra ko dharmadoot ke rup main lanka bheja tha
 The Mauryan rulers and Pulakeshin II had relations with the Persian king Khusro Parvez and Harshavardhana with China
 rajdooton ke aadan-pradaan kii vyavastha purnatah sthapit ho chuki thi
 Thus diplomacy was considered a part of the state craft
 rajnay anterrashtriya sambandhon kaa mul aadhaar tha
 The four well-known foundational principles of Indian royalty determine the mutual relations of states, charity, distinction and punishment, as in ancient times
 inhen nitishastra main ‘chaturpad’ kaha gaya he
 Sama means friendship and persuasion
 rajnay ke is niyam ke antargat vipakshi raja ko vanichaaturya tathaa rajanyik kushalta arthath tark or vinamrata se mitra banaaye rakhaa jaataa tha
 The vizigishu king should follow this policy
 yadi sam kii niti safal ho jaye parantu phir bhi uskaa purna parinaam nahin nikle to kautilya daan kii niti ke paalan kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 Donation means giving
 daan siddhanth ke antargat shatrupaksh ko apni ore milaane ke liye lobh or laalach detaa he
 Nothing is received in diplomacy without giving
 atah yadi rajya ko kuch praapt karnaa he to use kuch dena bhi padegaa
 Failure to divide or divide can be made if material and charity means failure in agreement and agreement
 shatru paksh main foot daalkar use durbal bana apana prabhaav badhaana raja kaa param kartavya hota tha
 According to Kautilya, the act of making distinction was to incite the neighboring states or inspire the eminent citizens and officials to revolt
 uparyukt teen upayon kii asafalataa ke pashchaat hi chauthe upaay arthath dand ke upyog kaa paraamarsh miltaa he
 Manu also allows its use as the last weapon as soon as possible
 manu ke anusaar sam, daan or bhed inamen se ek athwa teenon ke saath prayog dwaara shatru par vijay prapti kaa praytn karnaa chaiye, yuddh se nahin
 When these three measures are not attained, then it will be appropriate to take shelter of the punishment
 pracheen bhartiya itihaas main uplabdh anek udhaaharan is baat ko pramanit karte hai
 In all ages, there has been a system of punishment for accomplishing its purpose
 dand kaa arth rajanyik yuddh ke rup main bhi tha
 In conclusion, it can be said that since ancient times, the use of material, charity, distinction and punishment has been going on
 aadhunik yug iskaa apwaad nahin he
 Kautilya has a great contribution in the field of diplomacy
 vastav main kautilya or rajnay paryaayavachi hai
 Kautilya was a contemporary of Aristotle
 iskaa vaastavik naam vishnugupt tha
 In history, he is famous as Chanakya
 chanakya, chandragupta maury kaa raajaguru tathaa paramarshdaata tha
 Chanakya composed a famous book 'arthashastra' for Narendra for the path of the Mauryan dynasty emperor Chandragupta in the event of internal chaos and disintegration of the Hindu system in 326 BC, in the event of internal chaos and disintegration of the Hindu system
 is pustak kii rachana main kautilya kaa mul uddeshy sashkt rajtantr ke madhyam se bharat kaa raajnneetik ekikaran karnaa tha
 This is such a unique book of its kind that can be called the first book of India's political science
 isamen raajnneeti kaa vivechan swatantra vigyaan ke rup main diya gaya he
 The Mauryan rulers were able to establish a vast empire only on the basis of the advice presented by Kautilya for the operation of the polity
 isi kii sahaayta se chandragupta chakravarti samraat bana
 The importance of this unique, unique and unique book in the literature of Rajya Shastra is eternal
 isamen ucch koti kii shashan vyavastha, sarkaar, raja tathaa nitishastra jaise mahatvapurn vishyon ke gudh adhyayan ke saath-saath pratham khand ke solahaven adhyay main rajnay va rajdooton ke kaaryon ke bare main vistaar se varnan kiya gaya he
 Its seventh section deals with matters related to foreign policy, treaties and the protection of national interests
 arthshaastra ke adhyayan se do nishkarsh nikaale ja sakate hai
 First, the merits of the policy of any country can be evaluated on the basis of the results of the actions they have taken
 uttam ichchhaaon ke galat parinaam kharaab niti ke dyotak hai
 Secondly, since both the motivation of politics and their results are created by humans, it is computable
 kautilya ne pratham baar bharat ko vyavasthit or sthapit rajnay ke niyamon ko bhent kii
 Certainly ancient India was mature in the diplomatic system
 iske dwaara diye gayi niyam, saadhaaran parivartan ke pashchaat aaj bhi lagu kiye ja sakate hai, haalanki inkaa nirmaan aaj se hajaaron varsh purv kiya gaya tha
 Kautilya was the founder of the present economies
 usne rajya ke sambandhon ko rashtron ke madhya 'shakti sangharsh' ke rup main prastut kiya tha
 Kautilya's aim was to establish a strong and powerful kingdom
 atah usne raja ko paraamarsh diya ki vah apni bhautik shakti kii vruddhi kare, or is ore nirantar ytnsheel rahe
 The manifest part of realism is found in the policies of Chandragupta Maurya and Samudragupta
 apni yathartwaadee nitiyon ke parinamswaroop chandragupta samrajya sthapit karne tathaa us samay ko raajnneeti ko sthayitv pradaan karne main safal rahaa
 On the basis of its realistic policies, Kautilya can be considered the grandfather of those who founded the realistic school of Margentho and its worthy disciple
 kautilya shashan kii sampoorn shakti raja main kendirat karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, the main focus of his thought was the king
 kautilya raja se kachhue kii bhaanti apni dhan-smapda or sroton ko shatru se chhipaakar rakhane kii apeksha karata tha, jisase ki shatru paksh uski shakti kaa sahi anumaan nahin laga sake
 He has given the king the highest position
 uski yah manyata thi ki raja ke gun or dosha par hi rajya kii unnati or patan nirbhar he
 Kautilya, who aspired to build a strong India, like Chandragupta Maurya, believed that it was possible only through clever measures - material, charity, distinction and punishment
 kyonki ar rajya kii vyavastha va samasyayen alag hoti hai atah rajya apni pruthak sthitiyon ke anuroop nirdisht chaturvidhaon main se ekaadhik kaa upyog kar saktaa he
 The aim of Kautilya's diplomacy was also to help the Vizigishu state to achieve victory, develop diplomatic behavior and make it permanent
 kautilya dwaara rajnay ke upyog ke saat tatv the- swami, amatya, janapad, durg, kosh, dand or mitra
 Kautilya has given a detailed description of all this
 swami arthath raja in sabakaa kendra tha
 Its post had its own rights and responsibilities
 kautilya raja tathaa rajya ko shaktishaalee evam surakshit banaaye rakhane ke liye raja ke jivan kii suraksha ko mahatv detaa he
 The fort of the king should be completely protected from the boundary wall and the moat all around
 ghoshaal ke shabdon main "raja ko vyaktigat suraksha rajya kii suraksha kii kunjee he
 "arthashastra also advises the king to be constantly endeavoring to maintain the security and sovereignty of his kingdom
 bhartiya rajnay ke itihaas main kautilya kii mandlik vyavastha yatharthwaad kii dyotak he
 The foreign policy was governed according to the doctrinal principle
 kautilya ke anusaar-videsh niti kaa mul uddeshy raja dwaara sarvocch shakti praapt kar apane shatru ko usase vanchit karnaa hota he
 The king should adopt such a policy which will enhance his own interest and harm the enemy
 yadi padosi rajya durbal ho athwa uski sainik shakti ksheen ho to raja ko aavashyaktaanusaar uski sahaayta kar, uski prashansa kar, uske saath sthaayee athwa asthaayee sandhi kar apane uddeshy kii prapti kerani chaiye
 Kautilya has also emphasized the establishment of matrimonial relations with the girls of these states in order to forge friendship or lasting friendship with the neighboring state
 uske anusaar shaktishaalee raja kii kabhi bhi upeksha nahin kerani chaiye
 a weak enemy on its border is also harmful
 kautilya ne shatru kii vishesh paribhaasha di he- shatru vah desh he jo apane desh kii seemaa par ho or mitra vah he jo tumhaare desh kii seemaa par sthit rajya kii seemaa par ho
 Kautilya believed that a powerful country situated on the border is a possible enemy of the future
 yah rajnay kaa kartavya he ki vah isaki shatruta ko samaapt kare, kyonki seemaa par sthaayee shatru kii upasthiti desh ke liye hanikaarak siddh ho sakati he
 Regarding the powerful state, Kautilya's advice was that a policy of 'neglect' should be used for a temporary period
 madhyaantar ke iskaal main raja ko shatru paksh ko durbal karne ke liye guptcharon ke sahyog se unamem matbhed paidaa karnaa chaiye
 Meanwhile, a policy of neutrality against private conflicts, treaties or factions of powerful states should be adopted or a powerful state should be supported
 kotilya kaa mat tha ki yadi sambhav ho to durbal athwa ashrayaheen shatru ko aatmsaat kar, apni shakti kaa nirantar vikaas karnaa chaiye
 In this way, Kautilya advises the king to adopt a policy of balance of power, to increase his security and his honor and wealth
 ullekhneey he ki kautilya dwaara varnit rajnay aadarshon se prerit na hokar keval thos or vaastavik parinaamon ko drushti main rakhata tha
 This is the reason that Kautilya advises the king to use 'maya' and 'indrajal' i
e
 spying, along with 'neglect' towards the enemy side
 iske atirikt, kautilya raja ko raajnneeti ke sambandh main do or mahatvapurn paraamarsh detaa he
 First, the policy of the country should be completely well-organized and public welfare
 dwitiya, us niti main samyaanukool parivartan karte rahanaa chaiye jisase shatru paksh ko laabh na pahunche
 Kautilya advises the king to follow the path of peace as far as possible
 jab shaanti or yuddh se samaan laabh kii aashaa ho to shaanti kii niti adhik laabhprad hogi, kyonki yuddh main sadaiv hi shakti va dhan kaa apvyay hota he
 Similarly, when there is equal benefit from neutrality and war, only neutral policy will be more beneficial and satisfactory
 kautilya kaa yah vichaar tha ki shantipurna upayon kii asafalataa kii sthiti main prayek rajya yuddh ko ek vikalp ke rup main apane samaksh rakhata he
 In the words of Panikkar, it is worth considering as a policy of war only when all efforts have failed, and all circumstances are favorable for the use of weapons
 pracheen bharat main yuddh ko yathasambhav taalane kii niti kaa anukaran kiya jaataa tha
 For example, a powerful king like Chandragupta did not follow an aggressive policy even with a weak neighboring king like Seleucus
 kautilya ne yuddh teen prakaar ke bataaye hai- prakaash yuddh, kuta yuddh or trushni yuddh
 Kautilya has shown the importance of Durg Vidhan for the defense of the state
 bal athwa sena saptang rajya kaa pradhan shastr tha
 Kautilya considered morality secondary to achieving the objectives of security and prosperity of the state
 kautilya ke dhokhe, chal kapat, hinsa or yuddh ke peeche uskaa yatharth, teevr buddhi or raashtra-prem jhalkata tha
 Despite all this, Kautilya does not allow the king to be anti-religious and tyrannical
 vah rajya ko swechhachari banane detaa he, parantu raja ko har haalat main dharm shastron or nitishastron ke sthapit siddhanton ke anusaar chalane kaa hi paraamarsh detaa he
 He considered the use of intelligence forces as essential to the defense of the state
 vah asantusht tatwon, deshadrohiyon tathaa videshi shatruon ke saath vyavhaar main naitikta ke tyaag kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 Kautilya also justifies the art of governance and immoral acts in the interest of the king and the state and to kill enemies and criminals by deceit
 ek yathartwaadee hone ke naate kautilya ne rajya ke hit ke aage naitik mulyon ko mahatv nahin diya tha
 He understood well that states cannot survive on the basis of morality
 videshiyon se ladane ke liye dharm ke upyog kaa vah samarthak tha
 He was a supporter of keeping weapons hidden in idols of temples or gods, a king who was worshiped could be killed, he was a supporter of the use of secret conspiracies and murders against a powerful king by a powerless king
 uski drushti main shatru par vijay prapti ke liye naitikta or dharm vaanchhneeya tha
 He considers morality, even in principle, as valuable, because it is unusable from practical point of view
 kautilya ne duuton kii yogyata, prakaar, kartavya, aachaar aadi par vistaar se prakaash daalaa he
 Kautilya has considered the special importance of the messenger in the conduct of external policy of the states
 kautilya doot ko 'raja kaa mukh' maanata tha
 It was through this that mutual dialogue-exchange between states was carried out
 kautilya duuton ko teen shrenee main vibhajit karata he- nisrushtarth, parimitarth or shashanhaar
 The rank of Amatya was the criterion of determination in the category of any messenger
 amatya pad kii yogyata vaala doot nisrushtarth, uski teen chauthai yogyata rakhane vaala parimitarth or aadhi yogyata vaala shashanhaar kehalaata tha
 The task of the messenger of the destitute category was to present the message of his king to another king
 samast vivadpurn samasyao ke sambandh main aise rajdoot ke paas purnadhikaar surakshit the
 For example, Sri Krishna was sent to the Kauravas as an emissary
 shrikrishna kaa yah kathan is tathy kii pushti karata he-main shantidoot banakar hastinapur jaaoongaa or shaanti prayaas asafal hone par yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar duungaa
 Thus the emissary was entitled to negotiate
 is prakaar ke doot ko ham vartmaan kaal ke rajdoot ke samaan maan sakate he
 The powers of the envoy were less than that of the envoy
 yah doot raja dwaara diye gayi nirdesh kii seemaa ke antargat hi vaarta karne kaa adhikaar rakhata tha
 He could not get out of his instructions
 shasnahaar jo tritiy shrenee kaa doot hota tha vah keval sandesavahak hota tha
 Its main function was to exchange messages between the kings
 ise kisi bhi prakaar ke koi adhikaar nahin the; apane kaary kii samaapti par doot apane desh laut jate the
 In an article of 'international Law in Ancient India', Vishwanath has expressed the view that the practice of appointing permanent messengers did not begin in this period
 duuton ko asthaayee taur par thode samay k liye hi niyukt kiya jaataa tha
 Kautilya also describes another type of 'unauthorized messenger' which is the development of diplomatic behavior
 yah doot apane raja tathaa par-raja se vetan lekar donon ore se hi kaary karata tha
 Kamandaka has called it 'ambassador of ambition'
 kautilya doot kii niyukti main vyakti ke naitik charitra or uske vyaktitv ko mahatv detaa he
 In his opinion, as far as possible, a citizen of his own state should be appointed a messenger
 arthshaastra ke bhaag ek, adhyay 16 main doot ke aacharan sambandhi nirdeshon kaa ullekh he
 According to Kautilya, the messenger should live in the state with full splendor , because he represents the splendor and pride of the foreign country
 doot ko par-rajya main pravesh ke samay raja kii ajna praapt kar leni chaiye
 The messenger was presented to the king in a procession with full respect only after getting the order
 ise raja ke nikat baithne kaa sthaan diya jaataa tha
 Both sides showed respect to each other, keeping in view each other's reputation
 doot bhare darbar main apane raja kaa sandesh sunaata tha
 Kautilya also gives some injunctions for the messenger
 udaahranarth doot ko par-rajya main mili aatithy kii pratikriya swaroop prasannataa vyakt karne, apane bal kaa pradarshan karne, anisht bolne, par-strigaman karne or madhpan karne se bachanaa chaiye
 Apart from this, he should neither sleep alone nor talk about secret discrimination
 in satarktaaon ke pashchaat bhi yadi par-raja doot se aprasann ho jaye tathaa uske falswaroop uske vadh kii thodi-bahut bhi sambhaavna ho to use soochna milte hi turant bhaag janaa chaiye
 Kautilya has given a detailed account of the work of the messengers
 rajdoot kaa mul kaary do rajyon ke madhya shantipurna sambandhon ko banaaye rakhana tha
 Kautilya mentions two types of messenger work - first, peaceful work, second crisis work
 inke arntagat doot kaa kartavya he ki vah apane raja ke sandesh ko mul rup se par-raja ke samaksh rakhe
 According to Kautilya, on hearing the unpleasant message, even after picking up the weapon for the killing of the messenger, the messenger should say the message of his king as appropriate
 doot kaa pratham kartavya apane raja ke sandesh ko par-rajya ke raajaaon ke sameep le janaa or unako unke samaksh yathokt prastut karnaa he
 According to Kautilya, the messenger should work according to the time and situation, such as friendship with other messengers and districts, discrimination on the enemy side, flattery or bribe, etc
 should be used for achieving their purpose
 par-rajya main apane raja ke sammaan main kul kaa gaurav, uske aishwarya, tyaag, sampannataa, saushthav, akshudrata, sajjanta, shatru ko santaapit karne ko kshamta aadi kaa prabhaav vahaan kii janata par daalate rahanaa chaiye
 At the same time, by describing in detail the strength and power of the enemy, their military bases, military capabilities, fortifications, security system, roads, river-drains, etc
, and comparing them with the system of their country
 Must continue to give qualified advice
 uskaa kaary sandhi karnaa, mitrataa badhanaa, videshi guptcharon ko gatividhiyon kaa pataa lagaana or is sab kii soochna apane rajya tak pahunchaana bhi tha
 Kautilya expects the messenger in a crisis situation that he should keep trying to bring the disaffected section of the state towards himself
 yadi uske shaantikalin sabhi prayaas asafal rahen or shatru raja akraman kii taiyaari main lag jaye to antim shastr ke rup main janata ko raja ke viruddh bhadkaa kar rajya main foot, matbhed or kranti karwaane kaa praytn karnaa chaiye
 Detectives should be used openly to sow the seeds of conflict and conflict between the enemy
 kautilya ke anusaar duuton kaa kaary ucchadhikariyon ko pralobhan dekar ek-ek karke rajya ko chhod dene ke liye uksaana bhi he
 To achieve this purpose, sending his detectives as vaidyas, traders, astrologers, pilgrims, hunters, servants of the king, cooks and sages etc
 is his main task
 veshyaaon or nartkiyon se bhi bahudhaa guptcharon kaa kaam liya jaataa tha
 Sometimes in the palace, women would also get the rank of tambul or parasol so that they could continue to keep close to the king's intimate activities of the state
 doot ko par-rajya ke jail tathaa thal margon evam durgon aadi kii shakti se bhi avgat rahanaa chaiye
 The information about the habitable land of armies, knowledge of paths, fortifications and weapons etc
 should be constantly sent to your king, so that this information can be used during the crisis
 in sab kaaryon ke karne ke liye kautilya guptcharon ke upyog kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 In Altekar's words, the work of the messenger was to get to know about the real politics of that country by getting acquainted with the royal men abroad
 rajya kii saamaanya sthiti kaa gyaan praapt karnaa, uske jan, bal or anya sadhano kaa thik-thik anumaan kar apane guptcharon ke madhyam se gudh lekh dwaara apni sarkaar ko bhejnaa tha
 Kautilya has fully endorsed the ambivalence of the messenger
 uskaa mat tha ki doot chaahe kisi hi apriy baat kahe athwa kisi bhi jati kaa ho, vah prayek avasthaa main avadhya he
 Kautilya does not accept slaughter of a Brahmin messenger under any circumstances
 shatru raja ke naaraaz hone par doot ko raja ko yaad dilaa dena chaiye ke ve jo kuch apriy sandesh de rahe hai vah unke raja kaa he
 The messenger is the representative of the king, so the ambassador should not be punished while giving unpleasant messages and fulfilling his duty
 is prakaar is kaal main rajdoot kii sthiti pavitra evam nirdosh sandeshvahak kii thi
 Detectives were openly used in the Mauryan political system
 kautilya ne is vyavastha ko or bhi adhik nipun banaakar use rajya vyavastha kaa ek abhinn ang bana diya tha
 He proposed the use of detectives in both internal and external areas
 is tathy ke anek pramaan hai ki inkaa jaal sampoorn samrajya tathaa padosi deshon main bicha hua tha
 Kautilya has told that detectives should obtain information by staying abroad as Kapalik, monk, businessman etc
 ye foot daalane or vidrah ko bhadakaane kaa bhi kaary karte the
 The basis of treaties was the mandate of the doctrine, that is, enmity with its neighbor and dealing with the neighbor's neighbor
 kautilya ne rajyashilp ke antargat chah prakaar kii nitiyon kaa ullekh kiya he, sandhi, vigrah, yaan, sanshray or dvaidhibhav 
 Kautilya showed the importance of the treaty in these policies by first mentioning it
 vah prayek maanya sandhi ko mahatvapurn tathaa anulalanghaneey maanata tha
 He considered the process of oaths necessary for the sanctity of the treaty
 kautilya ne pandraa prakaar kii sandhiyon kaa varnan kiya he
 Explaining the treaty, he wrote that the treaty is that which binds kings in mutual trust
 athwa sandhi raajaaon ke parsparik vishwaas kii prerak he
 In simple language, a treaty is called the establishment of friendship relations between two states
 kautilya kii kootneeti ke pramukh ang ke rup main sandhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Kautilya was a proponent of maintaining peace by the treaty
 is drushti se vah sandhi kii aisi lacheelee sharton ke paksh main tha jo shanti sthapana ke uddeshy prapti ke saath-saath shatru raja ko nirbal or swayan ko shaktishaalee banane main sahaayak hon
 Kautilya believed that a politician should be realistic and not a wanderer in the dream
 vah sandhi ko suvidhajanak maanata he
 According to them, they should be considered only as long as they are in the interest of their state, then the development of diplomatic behavior is a violation of their honor
 kautilya haare hue raja kaa apni shakti ko punah praapt karne ke liye sandhi ulanghan kii chhot detaa he
 Thus Kautilya explains two types of behavior in the area of treaty - the security treaties are irreversible and the other treaties are infringing
 kautilya kaa naitikta kaa maapdand asaadhaaran he
 Kautilya was a firm materialist
 apane uddeshy kii prapti ke liye vah naitikta ke tyaag ko sahi maanata tha
 He considered morality and religion to be helpful in achieving the objective
 uskaa antim uddeshy rashtriya hit tha
 In those chaotic situations in which he advised the king through economics, defense of peace, security, freedom and universality was possible only by power and tact
 ullekhneey he ki apane ko nasht hone se bachaana hi sarvocch dharm he
 Kautilya's diplomacy is a very big gift to be adopted to fulfill this purpose
 rajanyik niyamon ke nirmaan main uske samaksh ekmaatr uddeshy rashtriya hit tathaa rajtantr kaa shashakt bananaa tha
 The abandonment of morality and the path of secularism was motivated by this aim
 isi main kautilya kii mahanata thi
 In the end, it can be said that Kautilya was the first thinker who analyzed and analyzed politics
 rajnay ke sambandh main isse purv jo vichaar hamen praapt hote hai, unamem kautilya jaisi krambaddhata, suvyavastha or vaigyanik drushti praapt nahin hoti
 On the basis of diplomatic ideas propounded by Kautilya, it can be said that Kautilya is the first person to fully discuss diplomacy in India
 rajya or shashan ke sambandh main liye gayi kautilya ke arthshaasthra ke pashchaat kaamandakeey tathaa shukranitisar kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he

 He also calls detectives as messengers
 shukracharya dwaara shukr nitisar main raja ko safal or samarth banane ke paramarshon kaa ullekh he
 In its fourth chapter, there is a description of kings, enemies, governance
 shukr ne mantri ko raja kii aankh, mitra ko kaan, kosh ko mukh, sena ko man, durg ko haath or raashtra ko pair mana he
 According to Venus, the importance of the king in the entire state system is more than all the organs of the state
 kautilya kii bhaanti shukr ne bhi raja kii dincharya kaa vistrut varnan kiya he tathaa shatru, mitra, madhyam or udasin raajaaon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Emphasis has been laid on fortification for the defense of the state
 shukr ke anusaar doot bhi raajaaon ke mantriyon main se ek hota he
 The same person is capable of becoming a messenger who is of good memory, knowledgeable, deserving, skilled and fearless
 kiratarjunium main doot ko raja kaa netra mana gaya he tathaa use paraamarsh diya gaya he ki use raja ko dhokhaa nahi dena chaiye
 To break the treaty, the king can point out the flaw in the treaty

 In Kural, emphasis has been placed on alliances against the enemy

 somdev kii ‘nitivakyamrita’ paraamarsh detii he ki doot chaahe chandal hi kyon na ho, athwa vah kaisaa bhi galat kaary hi kyon na kare, vah avadhya he
