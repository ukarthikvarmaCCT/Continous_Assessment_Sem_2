 kai nyaay simaaon main, ve nigam jinke shairdharakon ko simit deyta se laabh hua he, ko vaarshik aarthik vaktavyon or anya aankadon ko prakashit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki nigam ke saath vyapaar karne vaale lender nigam kii saakh kaa moolyankan kar saken or shairdharakon ke viruddh daawa nahin kar saken

 isliye simit deyta kii evaj main shairdharak kuch gopneeyata ke nuksaan kaa balidaan kar dete hai
 This requirement generally applies in Europe, but does not apply to the remainder, except for publicly traded corporations in the United States, where financial disclosure is required for investor protection

 Divided responsibility is essential for long-term survival
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek nigam ek maut ke liye jimmedaar paaya jaataa he, to shairdharakon, nirdeshkon, prabandhan or staff or nigam ke staff main dosha tathaa sazaa kis prakaar se abantit kii ja sakati he? dekhne korporate daayitv or vishesh rup se, korporate hatya
 There is a difference in court and state law
 kuch logon kaa tark he ki aisi paristhitiyon main ant main shairdharakon ko jimmedaar hona chahie, jo unhen nivesh ke samay laabh ke alaava duusare muddyon par sochane ke liye vivash karte hai, lekin nigam main lakhon chote shairdharak ho sakate hai jo isaki vyavsaayik gatividhiyon ke bare main kuch nahin jaanate
 iske alaava, treders - khaskar bachaav nidhiyaan - ek din main nigam ke kai sheyaron kaa kaarobaar kar sakate hai
 The issue of repeat barbaric criminals and alleged "capital punishment for corporations" is questioned
 
 Most corporations are registered as a share corporation or a non-share corporation with local justice limits
 share nigam puunji utpann karne ke liye share bechate hai
 a share corporation is generally a for-profit corporation
 ek gaiyr share nigam main shairdharak nahin hote, kintu aise sadsy ho sakate hai jinke paas matdaan kaa adhikaar hota he
 Some jurisdictions, for example, divide corporations into for-profit and not-for-profit forms instead of dividing them into shares or non-shares
 kai rajya peshewaron ke istemaal ke liye nigam main vibhinnata kii anumati dete hai 
 kuch rajyon, jaise georgia main, in nigamon ko "peshewar nigam" kaha jaataa he
 In modern economic systems, the tradition of corporate governance is widely reflected in business and non-profit activities

 Entities commonly called "corporations" are publicly traded or publicly traded corporations, where the shares of corporations are bought and sold by the general public
 duniya main sabase bade vyapaar adhiktar saarvajanik kaarobaar nigam kar rahe hai
 However, most corporations are called private, privately or closed corporations, meaning that they do not provide any market for the trading of shares
 Many such corporations are owned and managed by small groups or companies of business people, although the size of such a corporation may be as large as the largest public corporations
 saarvajanik kaarobaar nigamon kii apeksha nijee nigamon ke kuch phaayde hai
 a small, private company can often make changes to a company more quickly than a change-making decision, a publicly traded company
 ek saarvajanik rup kaarobaar company bazaar kii dayaa par bhi nirbhar he, company main puunji aana yaa janaa na keval company ke kaam par nirbhar karata he apitu bazaar tathaa pratiyogiyon dwaara kiye jane vaale kaaryon par bhi aadhaarit he
 Publicly traded companies are more profitable than their private counterparts
 saarvajanik rup se kaarobaar karne vaali companiyon main aksarjyada kaaryshil poonji hoti he or ye sabhi shairdharakon se rin baant sakati he
 This means that the capital of people investing in a publicly traded company will have less damage than those involved in private corporations
 Publicly traded companies however suffer from this exact benefit
 ek nijee nigam aksar swechha se kam yaa bina nateezon ke bhi laabh praapt kar saktaa he 
 haalanki ek saarvajanik rup kaarobaar vaali company share dharakon main laabh or vikaas spasht na hone par aksar charam jaanch ke daayre main aati he, jisase kaaran shairdharak share bech sakate hai, jisase company ko or nuksaan hota he
 Often this setback is enough to thwart a small public company
 ek saarvajanik company kii tulana main nijee company se saamudayik laabh adhik praapt hote hai
 There is a possibility of a private company staying in one place where it gets good facilities even if it is going through a difficult time
 In a bad year or a slow period in the company's profits, shareholders may suffer some loss of the company
 nijee companiyon kaa aksar karmchaariyon ke saath ek acha rishta hota he
 In more publicly traded companies, the first effects in a bad year include decreasing workforce by layoffs or cutting employees' hours, salaries or benefits
 ek baar phir, ek nijee vyapaar main shairdharak shramikon par laabh main hue is nuksaan ko daalane kii bajaae ise jhel sakate hai
 In many cases, publicly traded and private corporations are the same
 adhikansh deshon main mukhya antar yah he ki saarvajanik rup se kaarobaar karne vaale nigamon par atirikt pratibhutiyon kanoonon kaa boj he, jiske liye atirikt samayik prakatikaran, kathor nigam prashasan maanakon or nigamon ke pramukh lenden yaa ghatnaon main atirikt prakriyaatmak dayitvon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a private corporation can be a subsidiary of another corporation, which in itself can be a private or public corporation

 haalanki, bade paimaane par shairdharak kalah ke kaaran, sirf bees pratishat swaamitv-vyavsaay vaale parivaar ek peedi se adhik samay tak bane rah pate hai
 Private corporations also have the ability to harass the shareholder because minority shareholders cannot avoid bad behavior by selling shares in a public market and leaving the company
 ek parsparik gaiyr-laabhakaari nigam wo nigam he jo apane sadasyon ke laabh ke liye keval sanyukt rajya america main sthapit he
 An example of a mutual nonprofit corporation is a golf club
 vyakti club main shaamil hone ke liye bhugtan karte hai, sadsyta kharidi or bechin ja sakati he or club ke khatm hone kii sthiti main club ke swaamitv vaali sampatti iske sadasyon main banti jaati he
 Clubs can decide, through their corporate bye-laws, how many members to have and who can be one
 saamanyatya, jabaki yah ek gaiyr-laabhakaari nigam he, ek parsparik laabhakaari nigam ek dani sanstha nahin he
 Because it is not a charity, a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation cannot achieve a 501 rating
 If there is a dispute over the manner of operation in a non-profit corporation for mutual benefit, then its members can settle the dispute, as the corporation is formed only to meet the needs of its members and not the general public

 It was founded in 2013 by Dr
 Nand Kishore Garg
 25 may 2013 ko bharat ke raashtrapati mahamahim pranab mukherjee ke kar kamalo dwaara is vishvavidhyalay kaa udghaatan hua
 a vapor or boiler is a closed vessel in which water or any other liquid is heated
 isamen garam karne se utpann vaashp ko baahar nikaalane kii samuchit vyavastha bhi hoti he jisase vaashp ko vibhinn prakramon yaa garm karne ke liye upyog main laayaa ja sake
 Its design is such that at least heat is wasted on heating and it can also bear the pressure of vapor
 isamen garam kiya hua yaa vashpikrut taral ko nikaalkar vibhinn prakramon main yaa ooshmeekaran ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he, jaise- jal kaa ooshmeekaran, kendriya ooshmeekaran, vashpak-aadhaarit shakti-utpaadan, bhojan banane or safai aadi ke liye
 The mention of boilers has been seen in the history of Europe since the time of the empires of Greece and Rome, but their modern form has developed very slowly
 shakti utpaadan karne ke liye vaashp kaa upyog 19veen shatabdi se aarambh hua, lekin jab trevithik ne ucch daab ke vaashp kaa upyog apane injanon main kiya, isse pehle boyler kaa koun sa ang kitna majboot or kis dhaatu kaa ho isaki ore kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya tha
 By the early days of the nineteenth century, people who built boilers for any purpose would either make their own shape, according to their available means and facilities, or according to the place where they were to be seated
 aarambh main boyler taanbe kii chaadaron se or baad main pitwein lohe se banane lage
 The best shape of the boiler should be round in terms of strength and pressure, but there are great difficulties and difficulties in making water vapor by making it perfect, to sit steadily, and to make the heat of the fire reach the maximum amount of water
 
 majbootee kii drushti se golakaar ke baad duusari sabase uttam akruti belanaakaar he
 Thus, since steam is used for power generation, boilers are made cylindrical, whether they are made as a single drum or as a joint of several drums, or as a joint of drums and several tubes
 boyleron ke banane or sanchaalan ke nimitt, janata kii suraksha or boyleron kii kaaryakshmata kii drushti se ek alag shaastra hi ban gaya he, jiske kuch aavashyak vaigyanik niyam rajyon ke vidhaan main bhi aa gaye hai
 Every user of boilers is obliged to follow them
 boyleron ko unki banaavat ke anusaar do mukhya virgon main baanta jaataa he : Cornish boilers are the oldest type of fire-tube boilers
 isaki banaavat bahut hi saral hoti he, jiske kaaran yah aajkal bhi kaam main aata he
 It consists of a single smoke pipe, in the front of which a furnace is made
 aajkal yah boyler choti badi kai maapon main banaaya jaataa he
 Its smallest measure is four feet in diameter by 10 feet in length and the thickest measurement is 6 feet 6 inches in diameter and 24 feet in length
 isamen ek hi bhatthi or dhoomravahini hoti he, at: badi maap ke boyler main koyala thik prakaar se nahin jal paata or uske brihad aakaar ke anupaat se uskaa tapt dharaatal bhi kam rahata he
 Therefore, by making two furnaces equal in a Cornish type boiler, the same becomes called Lancashire boiler
 inaki anya banaavatein ek si hi hoti hai
 The smallest Lancashire boiler has a diameter of 5 feet, 6 inches and a length of 16 feet, and the largest has a diameter of 10 feet and a length of 30 feet
 anek baar isamen teen bhatthiyaan bhi bana di jaati hai
 Cornish and Lacashire boilers typically have a vapor pressure of up to 180 pounds per square inch
 in donon prakaar ke boyleron ko ant: prajvalit boyler bhi kah sakate hai, vaise to inamen agni kii jwalaaye bhatthi ke peeche kii taraf se ghumkar boyler ko baahar kii taraf se bhi tapaati hai
 In Cornish and Lancashire boilers, even with more than one furnace and large diameter smoke, their heated surface does not grow at will
 at: is uddeshy kii purti ke liye kai prakaar ke boyleron main badi agninalikaay lagane ke badale chote vyas kii anek dhumr nalikaay laga di jaati hai, jinke kaaran boyler bahunalika boyler kehalaate hai
 It can be both externally ignited and internal ignited
 bahyat: prajvalit boyler un vanya pradhan kshetron main kaam main laae jate hai jahaan jangalon main hi lakdi chirane kii aara mashine baithai jaati hai
 They are quite small in size and are portable
 is kaaran inhen le jaakar iton kii buniyadi bhatthi par rakh kar kaam chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Within the drum of the ignited boilers, one or two fire-tube furnaces and their ignition chamber are built into the foundation of the bricks, the hot gases from the back are returned from the chimney to the front of the chimney
 yah boyler drybac naam se prasiddh he
 Among the boilers, a boiler called Elephant, or Tischibin, is more commonly used in Europe
 isamen do athwa adhik dhol ek duusare ke upar neeche lage rahete hai or unka paraspar sambandh bade vyas ke chote nalon dwaara hota he
 The upper drum may or may not have thin tubes, but the lower drum must have a furnace and thin thin nozzles
 isi prakaar ke boyler kaa parishkrut rup jahaji kaamon ke liye bhi banaaya gaya he, jise scoch boyler kehete hai
 It has incorporated all the qualities of the above boilers
 lekin iskaa prajvalanakaksh purnataya boyler ke bheetar hi he, at: isamen kisi prakaar kii iton kii chinai nahin kerani padati
 The ignition boilers which are made for small tasks of running pumps etc
 are often standing boilers
 inhen cocktan boyler kehete hai
 Such standing boilers are fitted with two thick water tubes, called Galloway tubes
 jalanaliyon ke laabhon kaa varnan aage kiya gaya he
 The boiler of a rail engine is only ignited with ignition, but nowadays it is customary to install 2-4 nozzles in its furnace
 is prakaar ke boyleron main chote aakaar ke khadey boyleron ko chhod kar, jinka ullekh upar kiya ja chukaa he, anya sab jalanalika boyler bahyat: prajvalit hote hai
 They are often divided into three categories: * in which the drainage tubes are tilted from the horizon floor, pratham do shreniyon main to jal kaa pravaah swat: hi garmi kii parivahankriya dwaara hota rahata he, lekin tritiy shrenee ke boyleron main kisi pump kii sahaayta se balpurvak pravaah chaalu rakhaa jaataa he
 All waterborne, externally ignited boilers have vapors and water drums at the top and bottom respectively, which are interconnected by one or more numbers of small or large diameter vessels
 uuparavaale dholon main vaashp, athwa pani or vaashp, donon kaa mishran rahata he or nichevale dhol main keval pani or kabhi kabhi gadha pani or keechad bhi rahata he
 This drum is also called Madandram
 vibhinn dholo kii nalikaaon ke parsparik sambandh main vividhta rahane ke kaaran in boyleron ke kai varg ban jate hai
 The baycock-wilcox boiler is considered to be the best in waterborne boilers
 isamen chaar inch vyas kii nalikaaon kii shreniyan hederon main donon taraf se lagaakar, unke siron ko phula diya jaataa he or phir in hederon ke upar kii taraf lagi chaar inch vyas kii hi, lekin kam lambaai kii, naaliyon ko usee prakaar se baith kar, unke upree siron ko vaashp dhol main baitaakar, neeche kii nalikashreniyon ke puure jaal ko dhol se aage or peeche kii ore se sambandhit kar diya jaataa he
 The rear headers are connected to the bottom of the tank, collecting sludge and very condensed water as the boiler works, which is conveniently removed
 sthaliy boyleron main vaashp pani ke dhol ko naliyon kii lambaai kii disha main rakhaa jaataa he or jahaji boyleron main aadaa bhi rakh sakate hai
 There are two variations from the aqueous boiler described earlier
 is boyler kii naliyon kaa bahari vyas lagbhag shinch hota he or ve chah chah inchon ke antar par hederon se ek hi ore se judi hai or unka muda hua bhaag adhar main latakta rahata he, jis kaaran pani kaa pravaah ek hi disha main hota he
 Between these thin tubes there is another regional tube, from which the water flowing from one category of tubes goes to the regional tube and then enters another category
 is boyler kaa upyog kaarkaanon ke alaava jahaji kaamon main adhik hota he
 It is more publicized in the French fleet
 germany main bhi jahaji karmon ke liye isi se miltaa julata ek boyler banaaya gaya tha, jise durr boyler kehete hai
 In this boiler, two or three steamers are applied upwards and two or one water drum is attached to them by twisted water tubes, then it is called alpha boiler
 sidhi jalanalikaay lagane se kai laabh hote hai : pratham to vaayu kaa vyarodh badi saralata se kiya ja saktaa he; duusare sidhi nalikaaon ko aavashyaktaanusaar jis lambaai kii bhi chahen katkar lagaaya ja saktaa he, at: stock main phaltu naliyaan nahin rakhni padati; tisare pariksha karte samay naliyon kii pariksha dhol ke bheetar ghuskar saralata se kii ja sakati he or unhen badla bhi ja saktaa he
 These boilers are counted in ship boilers, which are famous for vertical tubes
 isaki sab jalanalikaay sidhi hi hai or neeche ke dhol belanaakaar hone ke badale di aakaar ke hai
 In the Thorncroft boiler, the outward duct range is somewhat curved
 aajkal audyogic kshetra main injanon, tarabinon tathaa anya prakaar ke yantron or prakriyaaon main vaashp kaa kharchaa itnaa adhik hota he ki saadhaaran boyler us aavashyaktaa ko puri karne main asamarth rahete hai
 The Yarrow and Stirling boilers, which we have described above , became a little more useful to large factories and power houses with a few changes, because of the reforms, they contained coal scavengers, oil, and iron-fired furnaces
 Also started being lit
 phir bhi ve aadhunik kshetron main pichad gaye, kyonki jahaji kaamon ke liye to 575 pound prati varg inch daab kaa vaashp, jiskaa unchaa taap 399° sein
 ho, kaaphi samajha jaataa he
 If yarrow and sterling boilers make two million pounds of vapor per hour at the same pressure and heat, it is considered quite, but terrestrial factories and power houses have 1,000 pounds per square inch and sometimes even higher pressure vapor than five More than a million pounds per hour is spent
