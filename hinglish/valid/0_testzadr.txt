 abhinay kaa uddeshy hota he kisi pad yaa shabd ke bhav ko mukhya arth tak pahunchaa dena; arthath darshakon yaa saamaajikon ke hriday main bhav yaa arth se abhibhoot karnaa"
 Kaviraj Vishwanath has said at the beginning of the sixth passage of the Bhagya Darpan: 'bhavedabhinayo s Vasthanukara:' That is, imitation of the state is called acting

 Bharat has explained in detail the method of sitting or sitting similar to motion
 jis prakaar europe main ghanvaadiyon ne abhinayakaushal ke liye vyaayaam kaa vidhaan kiya he vaise hi bharat ne bhi abhinay kaa aisa vistrut vivaran diya he ki abhinay ke sambandh main sansar main kisi desh main abhinay kala kaa vaisaa sangopang nirupan nahin hua

 In the 18th century itself, various theories and systems regarding acting arose in Europe

 kintu 'masco stage and imperial theatre' ke bhootpurv prayokta or kalasanchalak thiodor comisargevsky ne is siddhant kaa khandan karte hue likhaa tha: In the 20th century, many theatrical schools, theatrical institutions and theaters offered many new and clear theories regarding acting
 marks rinheart ne germany main or firmi gamiye ne paris main us prakrutivaadee natyapaddati kaa prachlan kiya jiskaa pratipaadan france main aande antvaan ne or germany main kroneg ne kiya tha or jiskaa vikaas berlin main otobrahm ne or masco main stanislavski ne kiya
 These users intercepted either the ideas of naturalists in naturalistic acting intermittently or even slightly incorporated the synthesic principles of acting that Kromisarjevsky introduced after 1910; But the majority of French actors continued to use the semi-orthodox method of the ancient Romantic method of the 18th century
 san 1910 ke pashchaat jitne abhinayasiddhant prasiddh hue unamem sarvaprasiddh mascon art theatre ke prayokta stanisalavski kii pranali he jiskaa siddhant yah he ki koi bhi abhinayta rangamanch par tabhi swaabhaavik or sachcha ho saktaa he jab vah un aavegon kaa pradarshan kare jinka usne apane jivan main anubhav kiya ho
 This internal naturalism in acting was not new to Stanislavski because some French dramatists had introduced their own acting methods based on these ideas in the 18th century
 stanisalavski ke anusaar ve hi abhinayta prem ke drishy kaa pradarshan bhalee-bhanti kar sakate hai jo vaastavik jivan main prem kar rahe hon
 Symbolists, ritualists and expressionists went against the theory of Stanislavsky in a new way in which the complete exclusion of truth and vitality was said that the lesser the act, the more real and less vivacious it would be
 abhinayta ko nishchit charitranirmaan karne kaa praytn karnaa chahie
 He should present the esoteric ideas with his voice, his gestures and postures, and he should present the acting stereotypes, life-communion-inferior, pictorial and puppet-dance-style
 roodhiwaadee log aage chalakar merhold, tairof or arvin piskator ke netritv main abhinay main itani uchhal-kud, natvidya or layagati kaa prayog karne lage ki rangamanch par unka abhinay aisa prathit hone laga maanon koi sarakas ho rahaa ho jisamen uchhal-kud, sharir kaa kalatmak santulan or isi prakaar kii gatiyon kii pradhanta ho
 This acting itself became known as Ghanwadi Act

 Thus, there were five types of acting practices in Europe in terms of acting: 20veen shatabdi ke chauthe dashak se, arthath dwitiya mahayuddh ke aasapaas, europe kii abhinayapranali main parivartan hua or praaia: sabhi europea tathaa amareeki rangashaalaon main prayek abhinayta se yah aashaa kii jane lagi ki vah apane abhinay main koi naveenta or moulikta dikhaakar atyant apratyaashit dhang kaa abhinay karke logon ko santusht kare
 Nowadays it is considered necessary for the actor to use his imagination to make such a combination of his acting in every circumstance in the sense of drama that it creates some special consciousness and liveliness in the play
 uskaa dharm he ki vah rangashaala ke vyaavhaarik drushtikon ko dhyaan main rakhkar apni pratibha ke bal se naatakkaar kii bhaavana kaa uchit or spasht sangrakshan karata hua naatak kaa pravaah or prabhaav banaae rakhe
 Today's famous actors say that the actor should not follow any particular method and should not follow any actor
 vastav main abhinay kaa koi ek siddhant nahin he, jo do naatakon ke liye yaa do abhinaytaon ke liye kisi ek paristhiti main samaan kaha ja sake
 Today's actor directors are of the opinion that good actors should find a certain system for all the roles of all the plays in the world and should educate themselves accordingly
 aajkal ke adhikansh natyagharon kaa mat he ki naatak ko prabhaavshaalee banane ke liye abhinayta ko na to bahut adhik prakrutivaadee hona chahie or na adhik abhivyanjanavadi yaa layvaadee
 Exaggerated acting should never be done
 aajkal kii abhinayapranali main ek charitrabhinay kii reeti chali he jisamen ek abhinayta kisi vishesh prakaar ke charitra main visheshta praapt karke sad sab naatakon main usee prakaar kii bhoomika grahan karata he
 These types of character actors are increasing a lot due to movies
 bhoomika main sweekrut pad, prakruti, ras or bhav ke anusaar chah prakaar kii gatiyon main abhinay hota he---atyant karun main stabdh gati, shant main mand gati, shringaar, haas or bibhats main saadhaaran gati, vir main drut gati, raudra main vegapurn gati or bhay main ativegapurn gati
 The legislation of these is dependent on various emotions, persons, situations and situations
 abhinay kaa kshetra bahut vyapak he
 In a nutshell, it can be said that the actor should be original and should not try to follow any method and try to make a proper division of the effect the playwright wants to make on the audience through his creation
 koi bhi abhinayta use diye gayi paatr ko kaise samaj saktaa he? diye gayi paatr ko manch par nibhaane ke liye har abhinayta apana tarika apanaati he
 But before doing that, the actor should understand the script very carefully, should also check the lines of the other characters, after reading the script, whatever thoughts come about the story and the characters should be written in the script itself
 a lot of information about your character can also be found by the characters
 apane paatr kii kaaphi visheshtaayen panktiyaan se hi mile sakati he agar lipi ko gaur se padaa jaae,visheshtaayen jaise kii paatr dikhnane me kaisaa he - yadi acha dikhataa he yaa bura, uskaa vyavhaar, uskabartaav, aawaaj or anya chijen yadi agar aap koi jinda aadmi yaa aurat kaa paatr nibhaa raahe he to koshish kare kii aap unhen gaur se dekhe, paryaveshan kare, unki chaal dekhe, unke baat karne kaa tarika dekhe, unke kaal ke bare me pad ke bhi paatr ko achche se nibhaane ke liye jitna ho sake research kare
 The actor must talk to his director so that he can use the character's idea in the mind of the director
 Some directors make it easy by giving a lot of information about the character, and some directors say nothing, that is why the actor One should not argue over the seven characters of the director and should take full advantage of his imagination, then, while practicing, you should wear the clothes of the eligible characters, because he is eligible It becomes easier to feel Su
 apane khaali samy me abhinayta ko apni panktiyaan dorhani chaiye, us tarah kabhi-kabhi apane paatr ke bare me kuch nayaa pataa chalata he
 If there is a feeling that is difficult to show, then create a situation in the mind with the help of imagination and connect it with that situation and use it

 The story of the twenty-first effigy named Chandrajyoti is as follows- Once Vikramaditya was preparing to perform a yajna
 ve us yajna main chandra dev ko aamantrit karnaa chaahate the
 Started thinking about who would go to invite Chandradev
 kaaphi soch vichaar ke baad unhen laga ki mahaamantri hi is kaary ke liye sarvottam rahenge
 He called in the chief minister and started discussing with him
 tabhi mahaamantri ke ghar kaa ek naukar vahaan aakar khadaa ho gaya
 When the General Minister saw him, he understood that there must be something very serious, otherwise that servant does not come to him
 unhone raja se kshamaa maangi or naukar se alag jaakar kuch poocha
 When the servant told something, his face went off and he left the king and left
 mahaamantri ke achaanak dukhi or chintit hokar chale jane par raja ko laga ki avashya hi mahaamantri ko koi ksht he
 When he asked the servant the reason for his going like this, the servant hesitated
 jab raja ne aadesh diya to vah haath jodakar bolaa ki mahaamantri ji ne mujhe aapse sachai nahin bataane ko kaha tha
 He said that after knowing the truth, the king's attention will be diverted and there will be interference in the yajna that is going to happen
 raja ne kaha ki mahaamantri unke bade hi swamibhakt sevak hai or unka bhi karttavya he ki unke ksht kaa har sambhav nivaaran karen
 Then the servant told that the only daughter of the General Minister has been ill for a long time
 unhone uski beemaari ek se badhkar ek vaidya ko dikhaai, par koi bhi chikitsa kargar nahin sabit hui
 He was given every medicine in the world, but his condition continued to worsen
 ab uski haalat itani kharaab ho chuki he ki vah hill-dul nahin sakati or maranasann ho gai he
 Vikramaditya was distraught when he heard this

 He dripped the drops of nectar and resurrected the daughter of the General Secretary and kept it for the Khwang Buti Janhit

 Lara Croft: Tomb Raider on the Internet Movie Database vanaspatik janan ek prakaar kaa alangik janan he jo vanaspatiyon main hota he
 In this reproduction process new vegetation is produced without seeds or spores
 vanaspatik janan prakritik rup se bhi hota he or udyanvaigyanikon dwaara prerit bhi ho saktaa he
 In botanical reproduction, a botanical part originates a new tree and starts a new life, separated from the parent plant
 iske do prakaar, ek prakritik or doosraa kritrim, hai
 Natural botanical reproduction is of the following types: samudbhavan koshika main ek taraf yaa chaaron taraf anek pravaradh nikalakar matra koshika se alag hokar swatantra rup se pravardhan kar koshikaon kii shrunkhlaa banaate hai
 An example is yeast
 ek duusare prakaar ke samudbhavan ko jima samudbhavan kehete hai, jisamen paitruk pind ke kisi nikle bhaag se kaliyaan nikalakar usee ke saath lipati rahati hai, yaa alag ho jaati hai
 This is seen in genus moss, liververt and coral dendrophilia
 bhustari yaa ranor main jo paudhe sidhe khadey nahin ho sakate ve jameen par rengte hue badhate hai, unke upar ke bhaag par valkal patr rahete hai, jinke konon main kaliyaan rahati hai
 Thin thin roots between buds leave the ground and thus new plants are prepared
 doob ghaas iskaa udhaaharan he
 Sucker resembles landfall
 antar yah he ki sakar main jameen ke andar tanon par valkal patr hote hai or unke konon kii kaliyon se shakhaayen nikalakar hawa main chali jaati hai
 Shattered roots emerge from the floor of each branch and enter the ground
 pudinaa iskaa udhaaharan he
 The terrestrial or offset also spreads like terrestrial, but it is shorter and thicker than the terrestrial and creeps a short distance and produces a new plant at the end of the stem
 patrakand yaa balbil main akshakoniya kaliyaan hoti hai, jo adhik maatra main khaadya padaarth ekatrit ho jane se moti ho jaati hai or jameen par girane par nae paudhe ko janm detii hai
 Garlic, inflorescence, banalu or zaminkand, pineapple etc
 are examples of this
 prakand yaa risom ke upar valkal patr or neeche jhakadaa jaden hoti hai
 Sprouts come out from the buds of the angles of the letter and go into the air
 jaden pramukh risom se alag hokar vanshavistaar karti hai
 Examples are ginger, turmeric and ferns
 ghanakand yaa karm ke udhaaharan ghuiyaan or banda hai
 Below these lies a bloated stem called mandal
 iske upar valkalapatr kaa aavaran hota he
 They have buds in the angle, from which the seedlings go up on favorable weather and the roots come out from the bottom and go inside the earth
 is prakar nae paudhe utpann hote rahete hai
 The bulb is very dense, but its mandible is smaller and there are thick thick slices at the top
 andar kii pattee ke kone main kali rahati he, jo anukool mausam par nae tane ko janm detii he
 Onions are an example of this
 kand yaa tuber valkalapatron ke konon main kand lagata he
 The stem of the tuber remains bloated
 isamen khaadya sanchit rahata he
 Potato is a good example of this
 aalu par kaliyaan yaa aankhe hoti hai
 Each eye produces a plant
 jadon dwaara vanaspatik utpaadan main satawar, dalia or shakarkand kii jaden kand utpann karti hai, in kandon se phir nae paudhe utpann hote hai
 Leaves of some plants produce new plants in production by the leaves
 inhen patrakalika kehete hai
 Examples of this are Kuchi, Begonia, Parvanta, and Calancoi
 kuch fern main bhi isi reeti se janan hota he
 Some plants also breed artificially
 kuch paudhe tanon kii kataran se, kuch paudhe kalam baandhane se or kuch daab kalam se nae paudhon ko utpann karte hai
 The genetic purity of the plant can be maintained by artificial botanical reproduction, which is not fixed by the plant produced by the seed, and the reproduction is often certain
 aise janan ke liye khaadya padaarth paryaapt rahanaa chahie
 In its absence, the reproduction may be sexual or asexual
 vidyutchumbakeey varnakram main un sari aavritiyon ke vikiran aate hai jo sambhav hai
 The electromagnetic spectrum of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiations from that object, or often just the spectrum
 vidyutchumbakeey varnakram nimna aavritiyon, jo ki nutan radio main prayog hotin hai, se lekar gamma vikiran tak hota he, jo ki sahasron kilometre kii tarangadairghy se lekar ek anu ke naap ke ek ansh ke baraabar tak kii sari aavritiyon ko liye hota he
 The short wavelength in our universe is limited to around Planck distance; And the long wavelength is limited to the size of the universe
 vaise varnakram ko aseemit evam aviraam hi kehete hai
 Different units of wavelength are generally used for convenience in different departments of the spectrum
 radio prasaaran main 1 meter ko ekak mana jaataa he, tathaa radio ke sookshm tarang vibhaag main ek millimetre ko ekak mana jaataa he
 10-4 cm for infrared spectrum Unit is prevalent and for visible light even smaller than 10-8 cm
 a unit of k is required
 10-4 sein
 me
 ke ekak ko mu or drishy prakaash ke ekak ko 'angastram' kehete hai
 Initially Angastram was also used for X-rays, but with more inventions in the X-ray spectrum, this unit also required a more subtle unit
 at: eksre ke liye tathaa gamma kirnon ke liye zeegabhra ne ek nae ekak kaa upyog kiya, jise eksre ekak kehete hai
 It is 10-11 cm m Is equal to vidyutchumbakeey siddhant kii drushti se eksre or gamma kirnon main koi bhed nahin he; eksre prayogshaalaon main utpann kiye ja sakate hai or gamma kirane radiodharmee padaartho se praapt hoti hai 
 In the electromagnetic spectrum, the department of extremely short wavelength is that of x-rays and gamma rays
 tarangadairghy aavritiyon kaa pratilomanupati hone ke kaaran eksre or gamma kirnon kii aavritiyaan anya vidyucchumbakeey vikiranon se bahut adhik hoti he

 udhaaharan ke liye, suez nahar ko yatayaat yogya banaae rakhane ke liye, usamen se ret nikaalane ke liye, badi badi mashine sadaa kaam main lagi rahati hai or bahut badi sankhya main ejeeniyar uski dekhbhaal ke liye rakhane padate hai
 In addition, "locks" are often made for traffic in canals
 in "lokon" dwaara unchi nichi satahon ke bich yatra sambhav ho jaati he
 Not only among the seas, many rivers and lakes are also connected by canals for traffic
 kashmir main dal lake or jhelum nadi ke bich aise lock sthit hai
 There are many cities in the world where canals can carry traffic within the city itself, such as the world famous Venice city of Italy
 holland main bahut si naharen amsterdam aadi nagaron main yatayaat ke liye bani hui hai
 In India too, large canals have been built for traffic between cities such as Buckingham Canal in South India
 choti choti yatayaat naharen to desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut si bani hui hai
 The second purpose of canals is to transport water from a river or lake to a far distance for the purpose of water supply or irrigation
 is disha main bharat main bahut kaary 19veen shatabdi main hua he
 By the way, many canals built from ancient times are seen in different parts of the country
 kintu vishesh kaary bhusinchan kshetra main hi hua he, kyonki bharat krishipradhan desh he
 Very large canals were built for land exploration
 kai shatabdiyon purv dakshin bharat main kaveri nadi par ek ainikat banaakar naharen nikaali gai thim
 In the modern era, large canals were constructed from the Ganges River, the Sutlej and Beas rivers in Punjab, through which millions of acres of land benefited from irrigation
 ganga yamuna ke doaab main ganga kii upree tathaa nichali ganga nahar se milakar lagbhag 32 lakh acre bhoomi kii sinchai prati varsh hoti he
 For this, the Doab areas of the Ganges Yamuna are spread around 8,000 miles of small canals, which irrigate the area between various rivers and streams
 yah bharat kii sabase badi bhusinchan-pranali he
 Apart from this, hydropower is also produced from the waterfalls located on the Ganges Canal
 at: naharon dwaara bahumukhi vikaas hota he or unase sinchit kshetra main krishi kii vruddhi ke saath saath udyog dhandhon main bhi pragati hoti he or logon kaa jeevanaster unchaa karne main badi sahaayta milti he
 The administration also earns revenue from good canals, such as the upper and lower Ganga canals, the Uttar Pradesh administration made a profit of about Rs 1
6 crore in 1958-59, after deducting all expenses
 naharen maanav nirmit jal pravaahan pranaliyaan hai jo do tarah kii hoti hai: 1
 Aqueduct: Those used for agricultural or human use
 taaze pani ko bhi zarurat ke mutabik pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 2
 Waterway canals: These canals are used in traffic
 yatriyon yaa vastuon ko jahaaz or naaven in naharon kaa prayog ke zariye idhar udhar le jate hai
 These canals connect existing lakes, rivers, and salamander
 jaise mashhoor suez or panama kii naharen
 nahar shabd multah farsi shabd he
 In the cities of netherlands, the city's canals are also called gracht
 sinchai kii naharon ke nirmaan main vishesh baat yah hoti he ki ye naharen aise pathon se le jaai jaati hai jahaan sambhavat: naharon ke donon kinaaron kii ore pani sinchai ke liye nikalakar bah sake
 Hence the flow of the canal is planned through irrigated area on the highest land
 nadi or naale iske vipareet, kshetra ke neeche se neeche hisse main hokar behate hai
 In fact, canals often originate on high ground between two rivers or streams
 kahin-kahin is ucch bhoomi tak pahunchne main naharon ko kai nadiyaan or naale paar karne padate hai
 For example, the Upper Ganga Canal has to cross four mountainous rivers, about 20 miles between Haridwar and Roorkee, at its origin, and that too in varying degrees
 vastav main rudki se haridwar tak upree ganga nahar ke saath pakki sadak jaati he or in 20 milon main ejineering ke kuch mahatvapurn kaaryon ko dekhne kaa avasar miltaa he
 At two places, the canal crosses the mountainous rivers at one place, the river is merged with the canal and at another place, over the Solani aqueduct, the canal passes over the river
 solani aquidct vishwavikhyath he
 This important work, with only bricks and lime, was completed in about 1850 AD
 sinchai kii nahar jaise-jaise aage badhati he, vah ped kii shaakhon kii tarah choti hoti jaati he
 On the contrary, as the rivers move, they become larger and their tributaries and streams continue to meet in them
 shakhaon se vitaran nahar athwa rajbahe nikalate hai or inamen choti naharen, jinhen miner yaa bambe kehete hai, nikalati hai
 From all these canals, water is extracted for fields by kulabe, maudhe or out late
 yah sab vitaran vaigyanik rup se nidhurit siddhoton ke anukool hota he
 If this is not done, the water cannot reach the canals, which carry water for hundreds of miles
 iske liye sarkari vibhaag sthapit he jinamein kushal ejeeniyar log naharon ko acchhee haalat main rakhane or unamem nirdhaarit maatra main pani chalaane ke liye niyukt hote hai
 Water in the canals is also run at such a speed that there is no erosion nor sediment in the canal
 jahaan bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he, prapaat bana die jate hai, taaki nahar kii tali kii dhaal nirdhaarit dasha main rakhi ja sake
 a lot of research work in this direction has been and continues to happen in India
 or bhi bahut si samasyaayen naharon ke sanchaalan main saamne aati rahati hai, jinka samaadhaan karne kaa uttardaayitv ejiniyaron ke upar rahata he
 Evacuations are also made in the canals as per the requirement, by which the additional water can be drained into the adjacent river or drains when not required or during any breakage
 aisa bahudhaa hota he ki nahar puri chal rahi he or us kshetra main baari varsha ho gai jisase paan kii maang shunya ho gai
 In such a situation Moghe or Kulabe have to be closed
 parantu sampurna pani ko nahar saadh nahin sakati, at: pani ko nikaas dwaara nadi yaa naalon main nikaalnaa anivaary ho jaataa he
 Where the canal is made through more filler, the two sides of the canal are made with great care
 udhaaharan ke liye, upree ganga nahar rudki ke sameep solani aquidct ke donon ore baari bharaav main hokar guzarati he
 There the filler is up to 35 feet, ie the land on both sides is quite low
 yahan pakke pushte banaae gaye hai, jo lagbhag teen mile kii lambaai main hai
 But still the water leakage takes place from the bottom of which there are drains on both the sides to contain it, in which the leakage water accumulates and goes into the river
 naharon se kahin-kahin rison dwaara haani bhi bahut hoti he
 Due to the formation of canals, the normal ground water level becomes high
 yadi aas-paas kii bhoomi main pani ke rison kii kshamta kam hui to jalrodh kii avasthaa ho jaati he or krishiyogy bhoomi krishi ke aayogy hone lagati he
 Therefore, along with the construction of canals, the construction of drainage channels becomes necessary
 yadi ye upaay yathasamay nahin kar liye jate to baari haani hone kii ashanka rahati he, jaisaa punjab ke kuch kshetron main ho gaya he
 Construction of canals as well as canals is mandatory
 sansar ke bahut se kshetron main pani ke upyukt nikaas na hone ke kaaran naharon se laabh ke bajaae haani hui he
 Somewhere, to prevent leakage, the bottom of the canals and the two coastal sides are concrete or chosen or fixed by other means
 iske dwaara pani kaa risna kam ha jaataa he
 This policy is particularly successful in the area where there is no irrigation and the canal is built only to carry water forward
 kintu jahaan sinchai hoti he vahaan is saadhan ke dwaara adhik dinon tak jalrodh se bachaav nahin ho paata, vahaan saavdhaneepurvak bhusinchan tathaa yathanukool nikasi naalon athwa bhoomi ke neeche atirikt jalanikasi yuktiyon se kaam lenaa anivaary ho jaataa he

 Since it is known from Tibetan historical sources that Shantarakshita's life was mid-8th century, and Haribhadra Pal was a contemporary of King Dharmapala, it appears that Sarhapada's life must have been late 8th or early 9th century

 sankshep main gulab raay ji kaa bhashaa sanyat, gambhir or pravahpurn he
 In the works of Gulab Rai Ji, we see the following styles: 1
 vivechanaatmak style- yah style gulab raay ji ke aalochanatmak tathaa vichaaratmak nibandhon main milti he
 In this style, when considering literary and philosophical subjects seriously, the sentences become relatively long and inaccurate, but where current problems, interpretations of ancient theories or interpretive criticisms of poets are presented, the sentences are simple and expressive
 is style kaa ek udhaaharan- 'rashtriya parv' kaa manaanaa kori bhavukta nahin he
 This sentimentality has value
 bhavukta main sankramakata hoti he or phir shakti kaa sanchaar karti he
 Thoughts can illustrate our condition, but the strong motivation and power of the work is contained in the emotions
 2
 bhavatmak style- gulab raay ji kii is style main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa sundar samanvay he
 This style is impressive and enjoys a prose poem
 isaki bhashaa atyant saral he
 The sentences are short and Urdu words have also been used at some places

 i also kept Chari 'bow' in a nearby field to maintain Vaishya religion
 jowar kii pattiyaan anth-anth kar battiyaan ban gai thim
 3
 Humor and witty style - Gulab Rai ji has also put humor and satire in the description of serious themes to overcome the drabness of his essays
 is vishay main unhone likhaa he- 'ab main praayah gambhir vishyon main bhi hasya kaa samavesh karne laga hoon
 Where there is a possibility of loss of meaning due to humor or if there is a very compassionate context, then i will avoid humor, otherwise i welcome the past humor as much as the miser or any unintended money
 ' is style main hasya kaa samavesh karne ke liye gubaab raay ji yaa to muhaavaron kaa sahaara lete hai yaa shlesh kaa
 The sentences in this style are somewhat large
 isamen urdu, farsi ke shabdon or muhaavaron kaa bhi prayog hua he
 Gulabrai ji has composed many original texts as well as edited many texts

 He has demonstrated his talent and originality in both criticism and essay fields
 hindi main sarv pratham unhone hi darshan sambandhi nibandhon kii rachana kii
 Gulab Rai Ji's essays contain the message of morality, progress for society, modesty approach, the simplest interpretation of complex theories of philosophy and sublime sense of national love
 ek moulik nibandhkaar, utkrisht samalochak evam safal sampadak ke rup main gulab raay ji ne hindi kii jo seva kii he, uske liye ve sadaiv prashansa or dhanyavad ke paatr hai

 Arakoshia is a city in Afghanistan
 saanchaa:afghanistan ke shahar Khurd and Kalan are Persian language words found in many contexts in Hindi and in the Indian subcontinent, especially in place names
 "kurd" kaa matlab "chota" hota he or "kalaan" kaa matlab bada hota he
 These names have been used since Mughal times
 choti aabaadi vaale gaanvon-kasbon ke peeche khurd shabd lagaaya gaya
 This Persian word means small
 yah khurd sanskrit ke kshudra se hi bana he jisamen laghu, chota yaa sookshmata kaa bhav he
 There are thousands of Khurd dhari villages across the country
 isi tarah kai gaanvon ke saath kalam shabd judaa miltaa he jaise kosi kalam, baamaniyaan kalam 
 Just as the word khurd became synonymous with small or small, similarly the word kalan became synonymous with big or huge
 kalam kaa prayog lagbhag usee arth main hota tha jaise bharat ke liye prachinkaal main brihattar bharat shabd kaa prayog hota tha jisamen burma se lekar iran tak kaa samoochaa bhushetra aata tha
 However, a word like Hindustan Kalan is not found in any travelogue
 greater britain kii baat chalati thi to uske upniveshon kaa sandarbh nihit hota tha
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Kalan is also important in the context of rural populations
 kalam multah farsi kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab hota he varisht, bada, deergh yaa vishaal
 However, its etymology is unknown
 kuch sandarbhon main ise semetic bhashaa parivaar kaa bataaya jaataa he or ise ishwar kii mahanata se joda jaataa he
 This is fine on the basis of Kalan's economy, but it is not confirmed by any Semitic metal
 kalam shabd kaa prayog sirf sthanon kaa rutaba bataane ke liye hi nahin hota tha balki vyaktiyon ke naam bhi hote the jaise mirza kalam yaa amir kalam al bukhari jiskaa matlab bukhaara kaa mahaan amir hota he
 Obviously, the word Kalan means great here
 muslim shasankaal main basaahaton ke namakaran kii mahima yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The names of many villages are associated with the word elders such as Sonpipri elders
 jaahir he hamanaam gaanv se fark karne ke liye ek basaahat ko varisht maanate hue uske aage bujurg laga diya gaya or doosraa hua sonpipari khurd 
 Many such rural settlements number in the thousands
 isi tarah kisi gaanv ke vishisht darje ko dekhte hue uske saath jaagir shabd laga diya jaataa tha
 This means that from the annual revenue collection, the part of that village will not go into the government treasury or it will get partial exemption
 mughalon ke daur main prabhavi vyaktiyon ko athwa puraskaar swaroop saamaanya varg ke logo ko bhi gaanv jaagir main diye jate the
 But to distinguish it from other villages of the same name, the newly created vassals used to add jagirs to them like Hinautia and Hinautia Jagir
 uttar bharat, pakistan or afghanistan main kai aise gaanv, shahar or mohalle hai jo ek jagah shuru hue or phir falkar unke do hisse ho gaye - ek mukhya yaa bada hissaa or ek chota hissaa
 In this case, "kalan" came to be called behind the name of the big part and "khurd" behind the small part
 iske is kshetra main hazaron udahaaran hai - Sometimes two villages and hamlets are different, but by and large they meet and become one
 aise main is kshetra main rivaaj he ke yah baat spasht kii jaae ke kurd or kalaan donon kii baat ho rahi he or unhen "kurd kalam kaha jaataa he - These two words are also used in some other contexts - malkam 4 ek britain kaa shaasha tha

 malagasi log do mukhya virgon main vibhajit hai
 The first class consists of "highland" people who live in the mountainous and plateau areas between the island of Madagascar
 jab bornion se malagasi ke purvaj teesri se dasvi shatabdi isvi main samudr paar karke madagascar pahunche to ve apane saath chaaval laaye the, jo sabase adhik dweep ke in madhya ucchbhumi ilaaqon main punap paata he
 The second class of Malagasy people are the "coast dwellers"
 haalanki donon virgon main hi bornion va purvi africa se aaye purvajon kaa mishran he, tatwasi malagsiyon main purvi africayon kii wanshajata adhik he kyonki ve aakar tat ke khaali kshetron main bas gayi the
 For this reason, the color of the highlands is somewhat lighter than the inhabitants
 ucchbhumi malagsiyon main ek upasamudaay, merina, vishesh rup se dweep par prabal rahaa he or unhone 18veen sadi ke ant main dweep ko apane adheen sangathit karnaa armbh kar diya or 19veen sadi tak lagbhag puure dweep ko ek rajya main band liya
 After this, France forcefully invaded Madagascar and colonized it
 baanto or raaj karo kii niti apanaate hue unhone merinaon ko apane adheen sarkaar chalaane main mila liya or bhinn virgon ke bich main dwesh or pratispardhaa ke beej boye
 Even after independence in 1960, these tensions remain

 antarctic prithvi kaa iklauta mahadweep he jahaan koi manushya mul rup se nahin rahata tha or yah sandhi vyavastha antarctic ke vishay main sabhi antararashtriya sambandhon ko nirdhaarit karata he
 The Antarctic Treaty came into force from 1961 and by 2016, 53 countries had signed it
 is sandhi ke antargat antarctic ko ek vaigyanik sangrakshit kshetra ghoshit kar diya gaya or is mahadweep par kisi bhi prakaar kii sainik kaarywai par pabandi laga di gai
 Also, an annual "antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting" tradition was initiated to decide on Antarctica cases
 jab sandhi par pehle hastakshar hue tab saat desh antarctic ke alag-alag kshetron par apni samprabhutaa kaa daawa karte the, yani un kshetron ko apane deshon kaa bhaag bataate the
 The treaty said that no signer is neither withdrawing from his claim, neither accepting the claim of anyone else nor making any new claim
 misaal ke liye france antarctic ke aadeli dharti naamak kshetra ko apana hissaa maanata he lekin sandhi ke antargat vah is daawey ko kisi or se manwaane main aksham he
 On the other hand, India does not accept the sovereignty of any country over any region of Antarctica and considers the entire continent the property of the entire human race
 antarctic sandhi main do prakaar ke sadsy desh hai - paramarshi or aparamarshi 
 According to the treaty, when the Antarctic Treaty Consultation Meeting takes place every year, the consulting countries have the right to vote on the proposals, but non-diaspora members do not have this right
 paramarshi sadsy banane ke liye kisi desh ko yah dikhaanaa hota he ki vah antarctic main anusandhan karne main sakriya he
 One aspect of this activism is to establish a research center in Antarctica where scientific teams from that country can work and live

 Romanagari means writing Hindi in Roman script
 udhaaharan ke liye : mera desh bharat hai
 hum sab bharatvashi hain, hindi hamari rashtrabhasha hai, hamen hindi bahut pasand hai
 internet par romanagari aam taur par unke dwaara likhi jaati he jo ki unicode hindi typing tuls se parichit nahin hai athwa is bare main paryaapt jaankaree nahin rakhte
 Many times romanagari is used even when such tools are not readily available
 iske prayog kaa doosraa kaaran he kuch aplikeshnon or internet sevaaon kaa unicode saport na karnaa jis vajah se roman hindi main hi likhnaa majaburi ho jaati he
 Apart from this, it is also used extensively in SMS and chatting
 romanagari main likhane se kuch nuksaan hai jinamein pehla to yah ki pathak ko ise padhane main bahut kathinaayee hoti he
 Letters have to be understood meaningfully which takes a lot of time
 sara jor likhe hue ko samajhane main hi laga rahata he jisase isse vishay par dhyaan kendrit nahin ho paata
 Yes, it can run in chat because then one line is written at a time which does not take much time to read
 doosraa yah hindi kaa ek vikrut rup he, kitni hi koshish kii jaae roman main hindi ko sahi tareeke se nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 In addition, writing in this form destroys the beauty of Hindi
 search kii drushti se bhi yah laabhadaayak nahin, kyonki romanagari main likhe gaye panne na to angreji search main aaenge na hindi search main
 Many people in the blog believe that either Hindi should be written in Devanagari, otherwise it is better to write in English than in Roman because it is easy to read and looks beautiful
 iske atirikt ek anya kaaran he romanagari main na likhane kaa
 Now such phonetic typing tools are available with which Unicode can be written in Hindi using the same keys as Roman
 arthath hindi main likhane ke liye typing seekhney kii zarurat nahin bas aap upyukt tul kaa prayog kiijie or roman vaali hi vartanee kaa prayog karte hue likhie vah khud hi hindi main chap jayega
 Currently most modern operating systems come with Hindi Unicode fonts, but even if not preloaded, Hindi Unicode fonts can be installed
 Apart from this there are many tools that directly convert the Roman script to Hindi, ie you in Roman If you type hello, it will be written in hello
 is kaam ke liye google ne anek bhashaaon main apane input tul banaaye hai jaise ki hindi ke liye hindi input tul
 Apart from this, there is also a tool called e-pandit Converter for conversion from Devanagari to Romnagari

 aadesh kii ekta kaa siddhanth - sanghathan main karyrat vyakti ek samay main ek hi adhikari kii seva kar saktaa he atah ek samay main ek hi adhikari se aadesh praapt kar saktaa he
 On receiving orders from more than one officer, his work interests may be adversely affected
 anurupata kaa siddhanth - yadi vyakti ke daayitv adhikaron kii tulana main adhik he to vah unhen puraa nahin kar saktaa he tathaa vyakti ke adhikaar dayitvon kii tulana main adhik he to vah unka durupyog karne kii koshish karegaa

 Therefore the organization should be compliant with the requirements
 adhikaar pratyaayojan kaa siddhanth - adhikaron kaa pratyaayojan sanghathan ke nimna str tak kiya janaa chahie
 If the person acting at that level is affected by the consequences of the decision
 ucch prabandhakon ko mahatvapurn nirnay lene evam baari niyojan ke liye paryaapt samay mil jaataa he
 Principle of simplicity - The organization structure should be simple and easy to understand so that all the people in service can understand it easily and the execution does not cost much and difficulties can be reduced
 lochashiltaa kaa siddhanth - sanghathan ke lochasheel hone se, bina baari pherbadal ke hi sanstha main naveen takneekon ko lagu karke kaary kushalta main vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 Therefore, the organization structure should be flexible
 yadi sanghathan sanrachana main bhavi aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar samaayojan kii vyavastha nahin hogi to sanghathan aprabhavasheel ho jaayegaa
 Principles of minimum power levels - For concrete and quick decision power levels should be minimized in the organization structure
 satta staron kii nirdesh shrinkhalaa lambi ho jaati he to nimna str par karyrat vyakti kii nirdesh praapt hone main vilamb hone ke saath-saath sandeshon kii shuddhta par bhi vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Principle of Conformity - There should be uniformity in the rights and responsibilities of the employees doing the same work, due to which the conflicts of rights will be eliminated and the execution will be efficient
 padaadhikariyon se sampark kaa siddhanth - ek upkram main sanghathan ke vibhinn staron par prabandhakon main upar se neeche kii ore varishthata tathaa adheenta ke kram main paraspar sampark hona chahie
 Principle of certainty - According to this principle of the organization, every action of the person working in the organization should be contributing to the attainment of the goals with maximum efficiency through minimum efforts

 monsoon ke mausam ke jane ke baad umas se thodi nijaat ke saath dashahra, diwaali or chhath logo kaa man khushnuma bana dete hai
 On the day of Makar Sankranti, people offer Chuda made of new paddy and offer curd and good food
 samay ke saath gaanv me bahut tarakkee hui he
 Roads have been good
 gaanv me dhoorbhaash or internet kii sevaayen he or jan yatayaat kii suvidha din ke 24 ghante uplabdh rahete hai
 Due to the efforts of late Ramesh Jha, water lines were also installed in the village
 lekin kosi kii najdiki kii vajah se pani kaa str jameen ke str ke kaaphi paas he or is vajah se log chapakal kaa pani hi istemaal karte he kyonki wo zyada taaja hota he
 The village has many primary and middle schools
 ladakon evam ladakiyon ke liye ek alag alag ucch vidhyalay he jinaki suchi neeche de hui he
 Due to the vastness of the village, worship, chanting, austerity hymns continue in many places everyday
 isliye yahan kaa maahaul kaashi jaisaa rahata he jahaan har vakt jap taap puja paath chalata rahata he
 Bhajan kirtans are a part of the evening's programs and many youth participate in it
 maithil brahman gaanv ke bahusankhyak he
 However people of other caste also live in this village
 maithil brahman me jyadaatar kusilwaar mul ke hai
 People of this origin have the surname Khan
 khan upnaam vaise muslim dharmavalambiyon me paaya jaataa he
 Khan surname is probably a unique thing among the Hindi religions
 khan upnaam kaise aayaa iske bare me kai raay hai
 Some people believe that the rulers of the Mughal Sultanate were influenced by the skill of tax collection of the Kujilwars by the nickname Khan
 The other belief is that once an Englishman plans to marry a village by being influenced by the beauty of a young woman in the village
 Created
 lekin ladki ke gharavaalon ne ye jab suna to unka khun khul uthaa
 Hence, he planned to kill that Englishman with a proxy
 unhone kaha ki shaadi paaramparik tareeke se kii jaae
 With the procession, the Englishman was burnt to death in a pandal surrounded by pallets
 jab angreji hukumat ke logo ne gaanvvaalon kii talash shuru kii to unhen dhokhaa dene ke liye unhone apana upnaam khan kah ke bataanaa shuru kiya tami unhone ye pataa lage ki ye log muslim hai or is tarah wo angrejon se bach jaaen
 satya kya he ye kisi ko pataa nahin he kyonki iskaa koi likhit sakshya uplabdh nahin he
 Significantly, in the 16th millennium, Akbar gave Darbhanga Raj the responsibility of tax collection of northern Bihar
 us se pehle dilli sultanate ke shaskaon ne, jinka rajya 13veen shatabdi se hi kaayam tha, bihar par shashan kiya tha
 Therefore this surname must have come sometime between the 13th and the 18th
 brahman ke alaava kai duusari jati ke log bhi rahete he
 Such as Nai, Potters, Paciba etc
 Apart from this, some Islam religions also live in the Mintoli area of the village
 inkaa mukhya pesha sabji kii kheti karnaa he or isi se wo apana guzaara chalaate hai
 These people are also called Kujra
 sabase anuthi baat ye he ki in donon hindu or muslim kaaphi prem bhav ke saath aapas me rahete he
 Hindus are present in the Tajiya of Muslims and Muslims are seen in Hindu festivals and fairs
 yah baat aaj ke paripreskshya me khaas he kyonki vishwa ke adhiktar hisson me dharm ke naam pe jang chhidi he
 Due to the vastness of the village, many marriages take place between two families in the village
 ye baat bhi apane aap me niraali he
 The village is quite safe
 chote mote matbhedon ko chhod koi ladaai nahin hoti he
 Many people believe that Babaji himself protects this village
 gaanv ke ghanatv ko dekhakar koi chor gaanv ki or dag bharne se darataa he
 It is believed that Babu Khan, the visionary of the village years ago, had laid the outline of the roads of the village in such a way that it is not easy for anyone to run away from mischief
 babua khan ne hi sau saal se pehle gaanv me dharmasabha kii shuruyaat kii thi jo aaj bhi jari he
 There is talk of religion and spirituality in this meeting
 bangaanv me hui prakritik aapadaaon kii do mukhya vajahen hai
 The first reason is after the Kosi river
 Kosi river is a manmatt river which keeps changing its current and direction
 In folklore, it has been referred to as "bataihia maiya" ie frenzied ma
 himalay ke god se nikali ye nadi dharti par aate he ajeebogareeb ghumaav lete hue akhirkaar ganga nadi me aa milti he or ganga kii sahaayak nadiyon me ek he
 This river is divided into two parts
 nadi kaa pashchimi hissaa gaanv se 8 kilometre pashchim he
 The dam on this river was built in the 1950s
 band banane se pehle kosi kii kai choti dharaaen gaanv yaa ird gird se ho ke bahati thi
 It has become quite controlled after the dam was built, but the traces of the old flow of the river still exist in the form of large pits found in many rivers
 band banane se purv gaanv me barh aana aam baat thi
 But since then, there has been flood in the village only once
 aisa san 1984 me supaul jile ke navahatta ke paas band ke tut jane se hua tha
 Due to this flood, water had entered most parts of the village
 barh kii vajah se sampatti kaa bahut nuksaan hua tha
 One or two people of the village were swept away by the flood current
 haalanki is baad bhi gaanv puri tarah nahin duba tha
 The center of the village, which is quite high and of plateau shape, was not submerged in water
 prakruti kii ek or aapadaa kaa gavaah ye gaanv rahaa or wo he bukamp
 is gaanv me do baar bukamp aaye hai jisase gaanv me kshati hui ho
 The earthquake in 1934 was very dangerous
 gaanv ke kai hisse me daraaren aa gayi thi
 Its intensity on the Richter scale was measured to be 8
1
 ye bukamp naa sirf bihar ke balki bharat se sabase bhayanak bukampon me ek he
 After this, there was an earthquake again in 1988
 isaki vajah se gaanv ke kai gharon ko nuksaan hua tha
 Its intensity on the Richter scale was 6
6
 vaise ye gaanv gaanv himalay se kaaphi dur he lekin iske baavjood prithvi ke garbh ke andar ho rahi uthal kii vajah se bukamp yahan aate rahete he
 This is believed to be caused by plate tectonics
 prithvi ke andar is kshetra me europe kaa plate, asia ke plate ke andar aa rahaa he or uski vajah sebukamp aate hai
 On one such morning in 1988, the dogs suddenly barked and the electricity went down
 iske kuch der baad, chapakalo or kuon kaa pani baahar aane laga
 There were cracks in the walls of people's houses
 lekin kisi ko chot tak nahin aayi
 There are many festivals of Hindus
 iname se kai aise he jo kshetra vishesh me manaaye jate or kai saare aise parv he jo uttar bharatiyon ke zyada ullas ke saath manaaya jaaya
 aise kai saare parv is gaanv me bhi manaaye jate he
 Holi is at the top of the festivals celebrated in this village
 On the festival of Holi, a lot of enthusiasm is seen in the villagers
 gaanv se dur rahane vaale log is maukey par gaanv aane kii puri koshish karte he
 In the village people, this saying is quite popular, "je jiba se khela faug" which literally means in Hindi that those who are alive must play on the day of Holi
 Malpua is cooked at home and people play Holi with each other with color or gulal
 holi yahan kai baar do dinon tak manaaya jaataa he
 First Dhurkhel is played in which people play Holi with each other with dust, dirt and mud
 duusare din rang or gulaal ke saath holi kheli jaati he
 Many times both Dhurkhel and Rang are played on the same day
 holi kii ek or khaas baat yah he kii yahan holi puure desh se ek din pehle manaaya jaataa he
 On the day of Holi, it is common for older people to drink cannabis
 kai yuva is din madhpan kiya karte he
 It is common to drink cannabis
 is ilaake ke bhoomi par bhaang apane aap upajataa he
 According to the chemical composition of cannabis, there is a lot of marijuana prohibited in western countries, and both are botanically female cannabis sativa species
 donon tetrahaidrocarbinol rasinic prajati me aate he
 The item after its drink has its own fun
 holi ke din kai log bhaang pite he or kai pariwaron me holi ke din bhaang pinaa bura nahin samajha jaataa he
 In Indian society, slaughter is viewed socially with disdain
 bhaang vitaran kaa ek aisa adda mayuri khan ke aadh hai
 Elder elders have been called with respect and fed cannabis there
 holi kaa din "jogira sara raa raa" se gunjyman rahata he
 a cultural program is also organized after Holi
 is kaarykram me shastreey sangeet me paarangat kalakaaron ko bulaayaa jaataa he
 In this program, artists like Pandit Rajan Mishra and Sajan Mishra have come in previous years
 is kaarykram kaa aayojan jamshedpur me rahane vaale gramin shri kameshwar choudhary iskaa aayojan kaary karte the
 Holi is celebrated in the month of March
 After that the festival of Sirua and Ramnavmi is celebrated in the village
 ye tyohaar chote str par manaaye jate hai
 Krishnashtami is one of the festivals celebrated in the village
 pehla din bhagwaan ke janmdin ke taur pe manaaya jaataa he
 On the second day, a big fair is seen in the village
 teesraa din bhasaan kaa hota he jisame saare bhagwaan kii pratimaaon ko visarjeet kiya jaataa he
 On this occasion, magnificent statues of all the people associated with the life of Krishna like Shri Krishna, Yashoda, Sudama, Basudhar are displayed in a special site in the Babaji Kuti courtyard, which was built for this purpose
 meley ke din khub utsaah dekhne ko miltaa he
 Children, big, old, young and women all take part in it together
 khaas kar ke bacchon or choti umr ke logo kaa utsaah dekhne ko banataa he
 Children get money to watch the fair from the elders and with great enthusiasm they buy the things they want
 In this fair, children have all the things to enjoy in the world
 rang birange, gubaare, khilone, bansuri, digadigaya gaadi, jhula, rang birange chashme or kuch khaane pine kii chijen unki duniya me khushi laane ke liye kaaphi hote he
 The elders of the village come to the fair with their grandchildren or grandchildren and enjoy themselves

 The "well of death" was a center of attraction for many years in this fair
 iske alaava kai log cinema dikhaane kaa bhi intejam karte hai
 There is also a dance concert on the first night of immersion
 manua dhar me murti visarjan ke saath kii is meley kaa samaapan ho jaataa he
 Durga Puja is an important festival in the festivals celebrated in the village
 yah parv das dinon tak chalata
 gaanv sthit maan durga ke bhavy mandir me din bhar gaanvvasi bhagwati kii archana me magn rahete hai
 During this, Ahurnish recitation of Durga Saptashati is done
 puja kaa aathvaan din kaaphi khaas hota he kyonki is din kai log maan bhagwati ko memanon kii bali chadhaate hai or baad me use prasad maan kar khaaya jaataa he
 On this day, about a thousand lambs are sacrificed
 ye kaam subah se dopaher tak chalata he
 Buffalo is sacrificed in the evening
 is me ek yaa do bhainson kii bali chadhai jaati he
 The sacrifice of these two animals is symbolic because Bhagwati too ended the work and anger
 
 memanon ko kaam or bhainson ko krodh kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 There are two communities of Brahmins
 ek wo jo maance khate hai or wo shakt brahman kehalaate hai
 Friends who do not eat meat are called Vaishnava Brahmins
 yahan ke log is tarah shakt brahman he
 By the way, many people in the village consider the tradition of sacrifice as atrocities against animals and they believe that such ancient traditions should end
 vaise gaanv ke adhikansh log is parampara ko badhaate aaye he or unka kahana he ki sadiyon se chali aa rahi parampara galat nahin hai
 The festival of Vijaya Dashami is celebrated on the tenth day of Durga Puja

 durga mandir se thik sata maan kaali kaa mandir he or unki puja bhi log nity rup se karte hai
 State Bank of India dohad shabd kaa arth 'garbhvatee kii ichha' he
 Presumably this is the Prakrit form of the word Sanskrit 'dauhrid' which has been accepted like other Prakrit words accepted in Sanskrit
 yajyavlky smriti ke anusaar garbhini stri kaa yah priy aacharan he jise avashya puraa karnaa chahie
 If this kind of aspiration of a pregnant woman is not fulfilled, she is not given the things that she wants in pregnancy, then there are pregnancy, death and other defects
 sushrut main 'dohad' kaa vishayvivechan is prakaar he - striyon ke garbhvatee hone se chauthe maheene main garbh ke ang pratyang or chaitanya shakti kaa vikaas hota he tathaa chetana kaa aadhaar hriday bhi isi maheene main utpann hota he
 At the same time, the senses have a desire to have some subject
 ise abhilaipuran arthath ipisat vastu dena kehete hai
 During this period, the body of women is of two hearted ones, one is its own and the other is the child of the womb
 at: is taatkaalik abhilaashaa ko 'dohad' kehete hai
 If their desire is not fulfilled, then the child born in the womb is Kubj, Kuni, Khanj, Root, Vamana, Vikritaksha, or blind and the other remains the hope of pregnancy
 eepsit dohad kii purti hone par garbhini kii santan balvan, gunavan evam dirghajivi hoti he
 Otherwise, there remains a fear about the womb or the womb itself
 vibhinn indriyon or vastuon ke aadhaar par dohad kaa vivechan karte hue kaha he ki garbhini kii jis indriya kii abhilaashaa puri nahin hoti, bhavi santan ko bhi apane jivan main usee indriya kii pidaa utpann hoti he
 If the womb wishes for the Rajdarshan, the child is beautiful and ornate; Righteous and sober, if you wish to seek shelter; If the desire of Devpratimadarshan is desired, then the child is devotuly; If you want to see the serpent Viyajatya fauna, it is violent; If you want to eat cow's meat, then Shur, Raktaksha and Lomash means more weeping; Banchar if you want to eat stag meat; Banchar if you want to eat the meat of Varah; If there is a desire to eat the flesh of the Varah, then if there is a desire to eat the flesh of the Nihaar and the Shur, the person is willing to eat the meat of the pheasant and the pheasant
 inke atirikt yadi anya jantu kaa maance khaane kii ichha ho, to vah jantu jis swabhaav or aacharan kaa hoga, santan bhi usee swabhaav or aacharan kii hogi, at: garbhini kii abhilaashaa ko avashya hi puraa karnaa chahie
 It is mentioned in literature as an ancient belief, Kavisamaya or Kaviprasiddhi, where used with a tree gives the word 'pushpodgam' meaning
 shabdarnav ke anusaar kushal vyaktiyon dwaara taru, gulm, lata aadi main jin dravyon or kriyaaon se akaal main hi pushpodgam karaayaa jaataa he, use dohad kehete hai
 The word Kalpadrumkar also called it 'pushpadgamgoshodham', a medicine that produces flowers
 meghdoot, raghuvansh or naishadheey charit main isi arth main is shabd kaa prayog hua he
 In Sanskrit poems and idols and paintings there is a lot of discussion about the flowering of the Ashoka tree with the beating of women
 iske baad bakul vriksh ke dohad kaa ullekh he
 Bakul is flowered after wreath with the face of women
 kalidas ke granthon main ashok or bakul in do vrikshon ke dohad kaa ullekh miltaa he
 The philosopher Vishwanath has probably first mentioned Vriddhodah under Kavisamay
 keshav mishra ne bhi apane granth 'alankarishekhar' main ashok or bakul ke dohad ko kavismay ke antargat sweekaar kiya he
 The famous commentator Mallinath also accepts Vrikshodha as 'kavisamay' or 'kaviprasiddhi', referring to 'kavisamayagate Satkavinam Prabandha'
 parantu kavyamimasaa yaa uske anuyaayi granthon main 'kavismay' ke antargat vrikshadohad sambandhi charchaa nahin milti
 Nevertheless, some trees, such as Ashoka, Bakul, Tilak and Qurbak are supported by poetic epics
 sanskrit sahitya main vrikshadohad sambandhi prasiddhiyon main adhiktar in chaar vrikshon kaa hi ullekh miltaa he
 Meghdoot's verse 'raktashokashkalakisalaya:' suggests that Ashoka was hit by the left foot
 'ek: sakhyastav sah maya vampadabhilashi kankshatyanyo badan madiraa dohadadmanasya:' is shloke kii tikaa main mallinath ne anek vrikshon ke dohad kaa ullekh kiya he jiske anusaar sundar stri ke sparsh se priyangu, mukhmadiraa se maulaseri, charnaghat se ashok, drushtipaat se tilak, aalingan se mriduwani se mandara, hansee se patu, phunk maarane se champa kurbak, madhur gaan se aam or naachne se kachnaar ityadi vriksh phoolate hai
 In Indian literature and sculpture and sculpture, Kavidamayi, Kaviprasiddhi or ancient belief mentioned as Vriddhodah is associated with some scholars who were the gods of fertility and rain
 vaidic devtaa varun kaa sambandh bhi gandharvon, yakshon, asuron or naagon se rahaa he
 Although the Yakshas were accepted in the Brahmin texts as Kubera, the god of serpents, Som Apsaras and Adhudevata Varuna Dikpal, Yaksha and Yakshini Apadevata were considered in later literature
 tantric parampara main yakshini kii siddhi ke dwaara bhi asamay main anek prakaar ke aashvarya krityon kaa hona sweekrut he
 Bhairavananda Yogi in Karporamanjari, Amarsingh Sevara in Prithvirajaso, etc
, were completely unforgiving in performing a variety of impossible and surprising acts on this strength
 jal or vrikshon kaa adhipatitv, jo yakshon kaa purana pad tha, ramayana or mahabharat main bhi sweekrut he
 There are many such stories in Mahabharata in which Santhanarthini women used to go to Yakshas, the god of trees, with the desire of children
 bharhut, sanchi, mathura aadi main santanarthini striyon ke is prakaar vriksh ke pas jaakar yakshon se var praapt karne kii murtiyan bahut adhik pai jaati hai
 It appears that in reality, the Yakshas and the Yakshanis were originally the gods of fertility and just as the deity of the deities communicated to the women, in the same way, the Yakshanis, the prefectural women of the beautiful women, used to communicate with the women-organ-contact in the trees
 ashok vriksh main dohasanchaar karti hui striyon kii murtiyan bhartiya shilpakala main atyant parichit hai
 The Indian Aryans merged these castes of the north with their overall qualities in such a way that they were united
 brihatkthamanjari, kathasaritsagar aadi main udayan or use putr narvarma kii kathaon se gyaat hota he ki vah samay in jatiyon ke ekikaran kaa rahaa hoga
 The mention of Vriddhodah as an ancient belief in literature, Kavisamaya, Kaviprasiddhi, etc
 probably indicates this integration
 yatra ke samay disha, waar or tithi ke kaaran utpann dosha kii shanti ke liye khaae yaa pie janevaale padaarth
 a description of it is found in Muhurta Chintamani which is as follows: purv kii ore jane main koi dosha ho, jo uski shanti ghi khaane se hoti he; pashchim jane main koi dosha ho, to machhlee khaane se; dakshin jane main til kii kheer khaane se or uttar kii ore jane main koi dosha ho, to vah doodh pine se shant ho jaataa he
 According to Narada, it is auspicious to go east to eat, eat matsyaan in the west, melted butter in the north and eat kheer in the south
 ravivaar ko ghi, somvaar ko doodh, mangal ko gud, budh ko til, brihaspati ko dahi, shukr ko jau or shanivaar ko urad khaane se yatra sambandhi varadosh kii shanti hoti he
 Madar leaf in Pratipada, washed water of rice in Dwitiya, Ghee in Tritiya, Yavagu in Chaturthi, Havishya in Panchami, Suvarnaprashal water in Saptami, Apoop in Saptami, Bijporaka in Ashtami, Water in Navami, Streevavimutra in Dashami, Yavan in Ekadashi , Payas in Dwadashi, Reed jaggery in Trayodashi, Blood in Chaturdashi, Poornima and Amavasya are auspicious by eating mohala
