 Architecture has been and is a branch of fine arts, with the aim of taking the support of industrialization and constructing a good building in terms of utility, whose environment is highly cherished, cherished and cherished and cherished for the cultured and artistic interest
 prakruti, buddhi evam ruchi dwaara nirdhaarit or niyamit katipay siddhanton or anupaaton ke anusaar rachana karnaa is kala kaa sambhddha ang he
 Such a configuration of maps and objects and enriching the structure in the most appropriate way, which creates a lot of interestingness, beauty, greatness, unity and power with maximum features

 Architectures are important in the history of a caste when civilization, prosperity and luxury come to them in some degree and they fully express the nature of caste pride, prestige, ambition and spirituality
 pracheen kaal main vaastukala sabhi kalaon kii janani kahi jaati thi
 But with the change of instinct and participation of allied businesses, it is no longer the seal of inclusive protection
 vaastukala puraatan kaal kii saamaajik sthiti prakaash main laanevaala mudranalay bhi kahi gai he
 This is as far as social and other achievements are concerned
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vaastukala bhawanon ke alankaran ke atirikt or kuch nahin he
 This is partly true as far as historical architecture is concerned
 phir vaastukala sabhyataa kaa saanchaa bhi kahi gai he
 As far as the archaeological influence is concerned, it is fine, but with a brief look at the history of architecture, it will be clear that the earliest efforts of humans are seen as the habitat cave-habitats of the hunters, the tents of the shepherds and the huts of the peasants
 nauka-awaas or vrikshon par bani jhopadiyaan purakalin vishistataaen hai
 The earliest attempts to build a religious monument were in the form of stone and wooden fences
 in adikalin prayaason main or unke sudhare hue roopon main sabhi deshon main kuch na kuch baaten aisi mahatvapurn or vishisht prakaar kii hai ki bahut din baad kii mahanatam kala kritiyon main bhi ve pratyaksh hai
 In the rapid development of the ages, architecture evolved, molded and conformed to the changing needs of humans - its security, work, religion, pleasure and other epoch-making symbols
 misr ke sade swaroop, china ke maanak abhikalp-swaroop, bharat ke videshi tathaa samrudh swaroop, mexico ke may or astek kii angadh mahima, yunaan ke atyant viksit devaytan, roman samrajya kii bahuvidh aavashyaktaaon kii purti karanevaale jatil prakaar ke bhawan, purakalin aadambaraheen giraje, mahan gothic girizaa bhawan or chitropam durg, turki imaaraton ke utkrisht vinyas evam anupaat or europea punarutthan ke bhavy vaastukiy smarak aitihaasik vaastu ke satat vikaas kaa lekha prastut karte hai
 All these buildings point to great epochs of human development, in which architecture is highly related to the ethnic life, reflecting the talent and ambition of the castes who have a clear imprint on their monuments
 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection
 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua
 Among the ancient Christians, this was in the form of a great zeal for the construction of churches that expressed the true simplicity and pride of Jesus Christ; Amongst Gothic makers, this structure was an ardent force with knowledge of mechanics; In the Italian revival it was the scholar of that era
 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 At the time, British traders still operated on the wave of local rulers, and so did the unstable political upheaval by Hastings and his allies in Bengal, where the elderly middle Nawab Alivardi Khan was likely to be succeeded by his grandson Siraj
 ud-daula, though many other rival contenders were eyeing the throne
 This was increasingly unsafe in Bengal during the British Trade Post, as Siraj ud-daula was known for harboring anti-european views and likely to launch an attack once he took power
 When Alivardi Khan died in April 1756, British merchants and small outposts at Kasimbazar were abandoned, weakened
 par 3 Since June, being surrounded by a huge force, the British were persuaded a massacre is taking place to prevent the surrender

 Clive was impressed with Hastings when he met him, and arranged for his return to Kasimbazar to resume his pre-war activities
 Later in 1757 the battle resumed, leading to the Battle of Plassey, where Clive would be a decisive victory over the Nawab

 In 1758, Hastings became a British resident in Murshidabad, the capital of Bengali - Clive on the cusp of his career a great step forward
 His role was in the city, apparently as an ambassador but came to Bengal, under the fast dominance of the East India Company he was often given by the new Nawab to issue work orders from Clive and Calcutta
 Authorities

 Hastings personally sympathized with Mir Zafar and considered many of the demands placed on him as a company

 During the reign of Mir Zafar, the East India Company was moving into an increasingly larger role, and effectively took over the defense of Bengal against external invaders when the Bengal soldiers proved to be inadequate
 As she grew older, Mir Zafar became gradually less effective in the ruling state, and overthrowed British troops in 1760, with her power and place to replace her with Mir qasim
reference error: The opening tag is bad or her Name is bad
 Transferred from Calcutta to Hastings expressing his suspicions, they were obliged to respect the honor Mir Zafar, but his opinions were dismissed
 The new Nawab established good relations with Hastings and again had misgivings about the demands he relayed to his superiors
 unhone 1761 main waapas bulaayaa gaya tha or niyukt karne ke liye kalakatta parishad
 Hastings was personally offended when he conducted an investigation into abuses in the trade in Bengal
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kuch europea or british-sambhddha bhartiya vyapaariyon the is sthiti kaa laabh lene ke liye khud ko samrudh vyaktigat rup se

 Hastings felt it was a shame to bring Britain's reputation, and he urged the ruling authorities to put an end to Calcutta

 Finally, little was done to stem the abuses, and Hastings began to consider leaving and then returning to Britain
 His resignation was the only delayed outbreak of lucrative fighting in Bengal
 Once on the throne, Qasim proved increasingly independent in his actions, and he again rebuilt the Bengal army by hiring European instructors and mercenaries who greatly improved the standard's forces

 He gradually felt more confident and at the disposal of a dispute broke out in Patna in 1764 when he captured his British garrison and threatened to execute him if the East India Company responded to the military
 When the soldiers sent to Calcutta anyway, Mir Kasim killed the hostages
 If the British forces went on there would be a series of battles and the conclusion of a decisive battle in Buxar in October 1764
 After this Mir Qasim was in exile in Delhi, where he later died

 Hastings' first wife, Mary, had died in 1759, and she planned to marry the model once she had obtained a divorce from her husband
 This process took a long time and it was not until 1777 when the news of the divorce came from Germany that Hastings was finally able to marry him

 During his time in Madras Hastings initiated reforms of trade practices which cut out the use of middlemen and profit both company and Indian laborers, but was otherwise relatively uneventful for the period

 At this stage, Hastings shared Clive's view that the three major British Presidencies - Madras, Bombay and Calcutta - should all be brought under the same rules being operated separately instead of the same rules as they were currently doing

 On his return to England, he was impeached in the House of Commons for crimes and misdemeanors during his time in India, particularly for the alleged judicial murder of Maharaja Nandakumar
 At first deemed unlikely to succeed, the prosecution was managed by lawmakers, including Edmund Burke, who was encouraged by Sir Philip Francis, whom Hastings was wounded in India, during a dispute: 190 Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan
 When the charges were read, the count of twenty took Edmund Burke to read in full in two days

 bhakthi aandolan madhyakaalin bharat kaa saanskrithik itihaas main ek mahatvapurn padaav tha
 In this period, the devotion of God was propagated in various ways by the stream of socio-religious reformers
 yah ek maun kranti thi
 The expedition was responsible for the customs associated with the worship of God in the Indian subcontinent by the first Sikh Guru Baba Nanak
 gurudware main gurbani kaa gayan, ye sabhi madhyakaalin itihaas main bhartiya bhakthi andolan se utpann hue hai
 The Bhakti movement started in South India with Alvars and Nayanars, which later spread throughout South Asia including North India
 is hindu krantikari abhiyaan ke netaa shankaracharya the jo ek mahaan vichaarak or jane maane darshanik rahe
 Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Namdev, Tukaram, Jayadeva gave more vigor to this campaign
 is abhiyaan kii pramukh uplabdhi murti puja ko samaapt karnaa rahaa
 Ramanand, the leader of the Bhakti movement, focused on Rama as God
 unke bare main bahut kam jaankaree he, parantu aisa mana jaataa he ki ve 15veen shatabdi ke prathamardh main rahe
 He taught that Lord Rama is the supreme God and that salvation is attained only through love and dedication to him and by repeatedly reciting his holy name
 chaitanya mahaprabhu ek pavitra hindu bhikshu or saamaajik sudhaar the tathaa ve solahavin shatabdi ke dauraan bengal main hue
 Chaitanya, a pioneer of devotion to God, promoter of Bhakti Yoga, worshiped God as Shri Krishna
 shri ramanujacharya, bhartiya darshanashastri the or unhen sarvaadhik mahatvapurn vaishnav sant ke rup main manyata di gai he
 Ramanuja did what Ramanand did in North India in South India
 unhone rudhivaadee kuvichaar kii badhati aupchaarikta ke viruddh aawaaj uthaai or prem tathaa samarpan kii neenv par aadhaarit vaishnav vicharadhara ke nae sampradaayak kii sthapana kii
 His most extraordinary contribution is the elimination of caste discrimination among his followers
 barahavin or terahavin shatabdi main bhakthi andolan ke anuyaayiyon main sant shiromani ravidaas,bhagat namdev or sant kabir das shaamil hai, jinhone apni rachanaaon ke madhyam se bhagwaan kii stuti ke bhakthi geeton par bal diya
 The first Sikh Guru and the originator of Sikhism, Guru Nanak was also a nirguna bhakti saint and a social reformer
 unhone sabhi prakaar ke jati bhed or dharmik shatruta tathaa reeti rivaajon kaa virodh kiya
 He considered a form of God and criticized the formalities and customs of Hindu and Muslim religion
 guru nanak kaa siddhant sabhi logon ke liye tha
 He supported equality in every way
 solahavin or satrahavin shatabdi main bhi anek dharmik sudhaarkon kaa utthan hua
 Rama's followers of the Vaishnava sect and followers of Krishna were divided into many small classes and creeds
 ram ke anuyaayiyon main pramukh sant kavi tulsidas the
 He was a very learned scholar and made a deep study of Indian philosophy and literature
 unki mahaan kriti 'ramcharitamanas' jise jan saadhaaran dwaara 'tulsikrut ramayana' kaha jaataa he, hindu shraddhaluon ke bich atyant lokapriy he
 He created the image of Shri Rama among the people as universal, omnipotent, the lord of the world and the realization of Parbrahm
 krishna ke anuyaayiyon ne 1585 isvi main harivansh ke antargat radha ballabhi panth kii sthapana kii
 Surdas composed Sur Saragar in Brajbhasha, which is full of stories of Shri Krishna's seductive form and his beloved Radha
 swami madhavacharya ne 'brahm sampradaay' naam se dwaitvaadi vaishnav sampradaay chalaaya jisaki ore logon kaa jhukaav hua
 Along with this, Nimbarkacharya, the founder of dualism, established the reputation of Krishna, the second incarnation of Vishnu, in place of Vishnu and replaced Radha in place of Lakshmi and gave a new look and enthusiasm to the love stories of krishna-radha prevalent in the east of the country
 vallabhacharya ji ne bhi krishna bhakthi ke prasar kaa kaary kiya
 Jagadrasiddha Surdas can also be said to be the main reason for the fame of this community
 surdaas ne vallabhacharya ji se diksha lekar krishna kii premlilaon evam bal kridaaon ko bhakthi ke rang main rang kar prastut kiya
 These pastimes of melody made the public very happy
 is tarah do mukhya sampradaay sagun bhakthi ke antargat apane puure utkarsh par is kaal main vidyaman the - rambhakti shakha; krishnabhakti shakha
 Apart from this, two branches also came into existence - Prem Marg and Nirgun Marg Branch
 sagun dhara ke is vikaas kram ke samanaantar hi baahar se aae hue musalmaan sufi sant bhi apane vichaaron ko saamaanya janata main failaa rahe the
 The exchange of Indian and Muslim culture was natural due to this long migration of Muslims
 phir in sufi santon ne bhi apane vichaaron ko jansadharan main vyaapt karne kii, apane maton ko bhartiya aakhyaanon main, bhartiya parivesh main, yaheen kii bhashaa-style lekar prastut karne kaa safal prayaas kiya
 There was no sense of bigotry in his views
 inkaa mukhya siddhanth prem tatva tha
 Though there was some difference in the effort being made to find God through love, yet the rendering and propagation style of his love element attracted people
 inhone akeshwarwad kaa pratipaadan bhi kiya jise kuch logon ne advaitvaad hi maan liya, jo ki uchit nahin he
 Many saints like Hazrat Nizamuddin Chishti, Salim Chishti, etc
, received the respect of all Hindus and Muslims
 is sufi mat main bhi chaar dharaayen mukhyat: chalin- Famous poets like Jayasi, Qutuban, Manjhan etc
 presented invaluable literature gems to Hindi literature
 nirgunagnanashrayi shakha par bhi inkaa prabhaav padaa tathaa hindu-musalamaanon ke bhed ko mitaane kii baaten kahi jane lageen
 Acharya Shukla also called them 'hindu and Muslim hearts face to face, eliminating strangers'
 ramanand ji uttar bharat main rambhakti ko lekar aae the
 The form of this devotion in his doctrines was of two types - the formless form of Rama; Avatar form of Rama
 ye donon mat ek saath hi the
 Rama would have been named in the form of Nirguna but he is not associated with the story of 'dasaratha-sut'
 ramanand ne dekha ki bhagwaan kii sharan main aane ke uparant chhua-chhot, jaant-paant aadi kaa koi bandhan nahin rah jaataa at: sanskrit ke pandit or ucch brahman kulodbhoot hone ke pashchaat bhi unhone desh-bhashaa main kavita likhi or sabko ram-naam kaa upadesh diya
 Kabir was his disciple
 kabir, raidas, dhanna, sena, peepa aadi inke shishyon ne is mat ko prasiddh kiya
 The akkad-fakkad saints who carry the mantra of Ramnama, forgetting the discrimination and said to embrace everyone lovingly
 vaidic karmkand ke dwaara faile hue aadambaron evam bahya vidhi-vidhaanon ke tyaag par bal dete hue ram naam kaa prem, shraddha se samaran karne kii saral paddati or sahaj samadhi kaa prasar kiya
 Kabir consists of three major streams - hathyog kaa kuch prabhaav in par avashya he parantu mukhyat: prem tatva par hi bal diya gaya he
 These saints have been a significant addition in the field of social reform
 in santon ke sahitya main hamen tatkaaleen yug kii saamaajik, dharmik, rajnatik samast sthitiyon ke darshan ho jate hai
 Their sum is also very religiously
 sahaj prem kii bhashaa par bal dene ke kaaran logon kaa in par bhi bahut jhukaav rahaa
 Shortly after Kabir's death, a community was established in it too
 anya shakhaon ke samaan iskaa mahatv bhi bhaktikaal ko purna banane main he
 These four branches were in their prime in the Bhaktikal or the middle part of the Middle Ages
 in chaaron hi shakhaon ne hindi sahitya ko bade-bade vyaktitv pradaan kiye jaise - sur, tulsi, kabir aadi
 Even for the extreme excellence of their devotion, they could dominate the minds of the people
 aaj bhi ye shraddha evam aadar se dekhe jate hai
 Though in the course of time, in these sects, even due to the entry of elements of immorality, purity did not remain and their decline too slowly, however, the amazing jewels which were received in this period, could not be attained in any other period
 This can undoubtedly be said
 bhaktikaal main har prakaar se kala samruddhi hui, naveen vaataavaran kaa janm hua, jan-jan main bhakthi, prem or shraddha ke strot foot pade, aisa kaal vastut: saahityetihaas kaa "swarnakaal" kahalaane yogya he
 Devotion was also preached in the free form of sects
 mira, raskhaan, rahim kaa naam utani hi shraddha se liya jaataa he jitna ki kisi sampradayabaddh sant kavi kaa
 In this way, it can be said that in the public there was more importance of pure devotion than cult
 aikanthik bhakthi ne samshtigat rup dhaaran kiya or jan-jan ke hriday ko aplavit kar diya
 Shortly after Tulsi's death, the signs of Reetikal's arrival were visible
 ram ke maryaadaavadi rup kaa samanyikaran karke usamen bhi loukik lilaon kaa samavesh kar diya gaya
 Out of the leelas that awakened Krishna's love and devotion, Krishna's erotic pastimes were taken and pornography was started
 yah sthiti reetikaal main apane ghortam rup main pahunch gai thi
 That is why it was said "radhika Kanhai is sister to Sumarin
 " rambhakti kaa jo rup tulsi ne ankit kiya tha, yadhyapi vah dhoomil nahin hua tathaapi raajaaon ke aashray main rahane vaale kaviyon ne shringaarikta ke vaataavaran main use vismrit kar diya tha
 In this way Bhaktikal came to an end gradually around AD 1680-90
 kalantar main yadhyapi janata main bhakthibhaav vidyaman rahe tathaapi na to is ko mahaan vibhuti paidaa ho saki or na koi bahut adhik lokapriy granth hi likhaa ja sakaa
 This movement of Bhakti era was a very big movement and India had never seen such a movement before
 is sahitya ne janata ke hriday main shraddha, bhakthi, vishwaas, jijeevishaa jaagrit kii, saahas, ullas, prem bhav pradaan kiya, apni mathrubhumi, isaki samskruti kaa viraat evam utsahvardhak chitra prastut kiya, logon ke hriday main deshprem bhi prakaarantar se isi kaaran jaagrit hua
 In the Bhakti Yug, devotional literature was composed mainly in this way, but it cannot be said completely that there was no other type of literature in that period
 yah akbar kaa shashan kaal tha tathaa uske darbar main anek kavi the
 Some of the royal poems of Abdurrahim Khankhana etc
 are found
 akbar ne sahitya kii parmparik dhara ko bhi protsaahan diya tha at: kavy kaa vah rup bhi kriparam kii "hittarangini" birbal ke footkar dohon aadi main uplabdh hota he
 Apart from this, the policy couplets etc
 were written
 ek or mahaan kavi acharya keshav ko shukla ji ne bhaktikaal ke footkar kaviyon main rakhaa he
 He has done this work on the basis of Keshav's creation
 keshav kii alankaar, chand, ras ke lakshanon - udaahranon ko prastut karne vaali teen mahatvapurn rachanaaon - kavipriya, rasikapriya tathaa ramachandrika ko bhakthi se bhinn maan kar bhi unhen is yug ke footkar kaviyon main shukla ji ne rakhaa he parantu yah uchit nahin he
 The master of Keshav brings glory to the entire ritual
 reeti - lakshan -udhaaharan ke nirdhaaran kii parampara bhi sarvapratham unheen main dikhaai detii he chahen reetikaal main is nirdhaaran ke liye keshav ko reetikaal se pruthak karnaa anuchit he at: unhen bhakthiyug main rakhana uchit nahin he
 The flourishing of fine arts is seen in Bhaktikal
 shrikrishna-radha kii vibhinn lilaon ke chitra is kaal main milte hai, komal evam saras bhaavon ko abhivyakt karne vaali anek murttiyaan is kaal main milti he
 Much development of sculpture took place in this era
 vaastukala, chitrakala main muslim style kaa samanvay bhartiya style main hua falat: mehraaben, gumbad aadi kaa prayog adhik dikhaai dene laga
 The Rajasthani style was more popular in the medieval period
 maanviya chitron ke atirikt prakritik drishyon kaa ankan, darbari jivan ke vividh prasang bhi bhitti chitra is yug main praapt hote hai
 'qutub Minar', 'two and a half day Jhumpara', etc
 are unequaled samples of historical architecture
 is tarah sahitya ke saath lalit kalaon kaa vikaas bhi bahut adhik hua tha
 There was a lot of progress in the field of music
 krishnalilaon kaa gayan, saakhi, ramaini, pad ko raag nibaddh karne kii jaisi yojana is kaal main he waisi anyatra prapya nahin he
 a number of ragas and raganis are mentioned in the Sura and Tulsi literature
 nishkarshat: kah sakate hai ki bhakthi ke udbhav evam vikaas ke samay jo kuch bhi bhartiya sahitya, bhartiya samskruti tathaa itihaas ko praapt hua, vah swayan main adbhut, anupam evam durlabh he
 Finally Hazari Prasad can say in the words of Dwivedi ji - acidfusin ek carbonic yogic he

 dhritarashtra janm se hi andhe the atah unki jagah par pandu ko raja banaaya gaya, isse dhritarashtra ko sadaa apni netraheenta par krodh aata or pandu se dwembhaavna hone lagati
 Pandu conquered the whole of India and extended the boundaries of the Kuru kingdom to the country of Yevno
 ek baar raja pandu apni donon patniyon - kunti tathaa maadri - ke saath akhet ke liye van main gayi
 There, he saw a mating pair of deer
 pandu ne tatkaal apane baan se us mrug ko ghayal kar diya
 The innocent sage dying dying cursed Pandu, "rajan! There will be no cruel man like you in this world
 tuune mujhe maithun ke samay baan maaraa he atah jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga teri mrityu ho jaayegi
 " is shaap se pandu atyant duhkhi huye or apni raniyon se bole, "he deviyon! ab main apni samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag kar ke is van main hi rahoonga tum log hastinapur laut jaao" unke vachanon ko sun kar donon raniyon ne duhkhi hokar kaha, "nath! ham aapke bina ek kshan bhi jivit nahin rah saktin
 Please also please keep us with you in the forest
 " pandu ne unke anurodh ko sweekaar kar ke unhen van main apane saath rahane kii anumati de di
 During this time, King Pandu saw sages and sages on Amavasya going to see Brahma
 unhone un rishi-muniyon se swayan ko saath le jane kaa aagrah kiya
 On his request, the sages and sages said, "rajan! No childless person can be entitled to go to Brahmaloka, so we are unable to take you with us
" "rishi-muniyon kii baat sun kar pandu apni patni se bole, "he kunti! meraa janm lenaa hi vrutha ho rahaa he kyonki santanheen vyakti pitru-rin, rishi-rin, dev-rin tathaa manushya-rin se mukti nahin paa saktaa kya tum putr prapti ke liye meri sahaayta kar sakati ho?" kunti boli, "he aryaputra! durvasa rishi ne mujhe aisa mantra pradaan kiya he jisase main kisi bhi devtaa kaa aahvaan karke manovanchit vastu praapt kar sakati hoon
 You command which god i should call
 " is par pandu ne dharm ko aamantrit karne kaa aadesh diya
 Dharma gave Kunti a son named Yudhishthira
 kaalaantar main pandu ne kunti ko punah do baar vayudev tathaa indradev ko aamantrit karne kii ajna di
 Bhima from Vayudev and Arjuna originated from Indra
 tatpashchaat pandu kii ajna se kunti ne maadri ko us mantra kii diksha di
 Madri invited Ashwankumar and Nakula and Sahadeva were born
 ek din raja pandu maadri ke saath van main sarita ke tat par bhraman kar rahe the
 The atmosphere was very pleasant and there was a cool, slow-smelling air
 sahasaa vaayu ke jhonke se maadri kaa vastra ud gaya
 This caused Pandu's mind to become fickle and he was prone to sexual intercourse that he died under curse
 maadri unke saath sati ho gai kintu putron ke paalan-poshan ke liye kunti hastinapur laut ai
 The sages who lived there left Pandavas leaving the palace, at the behest of sages Muni and Kunti, they all considered Pandavas as sons of Pandu and welcomed him
 sukhsagar ke saujany se One of the conspiracies of the Vaiseshika Hindus is philosophy
 iske mul pravartak rishi kanad hai 
 This philosophy is very similar to justice philosophy, but in reality it is an independent physicist philosophy
 is prakaar ke aatmadarshan ke vichaaron kaa sabase pehle maharishi kanad ne sutara rup main likhaa
 Kanad was a sage
 ye "uchhavriti" the or dhaany ke kanon kaa sangrah kar usee ko khaakar tapasya karte the
 That is why they were called "kanad" or "kanabhuk"
 kisi kaa kahana he ki kan arthath parmaanu tatv kaa sookshm vichaar inhone kiya he, isliye inhen "kanad" kehete hai
 Some people believe that they used to live in samadhi throughout the day and collect particles in the night
 yah vritti "ullu" pakshi kii he
 Who says that pleased with their penance, God preached the scriptures to them as a bird
 inhen kaarnon se yah darshan "aulukya", "kanad", "vaisheshik" yaa "pashupat" darshan ke naamon se prasiddh he
 Due to the lack of special practice in reading and reading, there are many lessons in Vaishika Sutras and 'errors' are also sufficient
 mimasaasutron kii tarah iske kuch sutron main punaruktiyaan hai - jaise "saamaanyavisheshabhavech" "saamanyatodrushtaachcha vishesh:", "tatvan bhaven", "dravyatvanityatve vayuna vyakhyate", "sandigdhstupachaar:" 
 There are two reasons for its naming - prayek nity dravya ko paraspar pruthak karne ke liye tathaa prayek tatv ke vaastavik swaroop ko pruthak-pruthak jaanane ke liye inhone ek "vishesh" naam kaa padaarth mana he ; "duality", "pakjotpatti" and "department of Departments" These three things have their own special view in which they are strong
 abhipraay yah he ki vaisheshik darshan vyaavhaarik tatwon kaa vichaar karne main sanlagn rahane par bhi sthool drushti se sarvatha vyavahaarat: samaan rahane par bhi, prayek vastu duusare se bhinn he
 They have emphasized the only special substance "special", so this section of ancient Indian philosophy is called "vaisesika" philosophy
 anya shastron ne is baat kaa vivechan nahin kiya he
 But for some of the above reasons, this philosophy has been termed as "vaishika Darshan"
 vaisheshik tathaa nyaay donon darshan hi "samantantr" hai
 The practical world is considered real
 ye bahya jagat tathaa antarjagat kii avadharana main paratpar evam ghanishtha sambandh maanate hai
 The external world is not dependent on thought, it is independent
 'aatmadarshan' ke liye vishwa kii sabhi choti-badi, tathvik tathaa tuchh vastuon kaa gyaan praapt karnaa saamaan rup se aavashyak he
 Knowledge of these elements requires evidence
 nyaayashastra main pramaan par vishesh vichaar kiya gaya he, kintu vaisheshik darshan main mukhya rup se 'prameya' ke vichaar par bal diya gaya he
 It is necessary to remember here that Vaishika, like justice, philosophically considers the 'real' elements of the world from a cosmic point of view
 loukik jagat kii vaastavik paristhitiyon kii upeksha vah kabhi nahin karata, tathaapi jahaan kisi tatv kaa vichaar bina sookshm drushti kaa ho nahin saktaa, vahaan kisi prakaar atindriya, adrusht, sookshm, yogaj aadi hetuon ke aadhaar par apane siddhant ko sthapit karnaa is dhara ke darshanikon kaa swabhaav he, anyathaa unki vaicharik bhitiyaan antarvirohi hotin ; faltah parmaanu, akaash, kaal, dik, aatma, man aadi sattaaon kaa sweekaar is darshan main baraabar upasthit he
 The nature, dress and ethos of Vaishyasikas are like 'nayayakis'; As such, these people are Shaiva, they were given Shaiva initiation
 inke chaar pramukh bhed hai - shaiva, pashupat, mahavrathdhar, tathaa kalmukh evam bharat, bhaktar, aadi gaun bhed bhi milte hai
 The Vaiseshiks are specifically called "pashupat"
 
 In Vaisesika opinion, the whole world is divided into these two divisions
 inamen "bhav" ke chah vibhaag kiye gaye hai- jinke naam hai - dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, tathaa samavaay
 There are also four sub-distinctions of absence - Pragbhava, Prabandhbhava, Extreme feeling and Interaction
 granthon main inke lakshan aadi kuch is tarah praapt hote hai : In matter, the "matter is caste" is the substance
 kaary ke samavayikaran ko dravya kehete hai
 Matter is a shelter of virtues
 prithvi, jal, tejas, vaayu, akaash, kaal, dik, aatma tathaa manas ye nau "dravya" kehalaate hai
 Of these, the first four liquids have two distinctions, Nitya and Anitya
 nityarup ko "parmaanu" tathaa anitya rup ko kaary kehete hai
 That part of the four ghosts is called "atom" which cannot be reparted, hence it is continual
 prithviparmanu ke atirikt anya parmaanuon ke gun bhi nity he
 The "earth" that smells, the "water" that has a cold touch, the "water" that has a warm touch, the "tejas", which does not have form and is not an accidental and imperfect touch of fire, that "air", And the word which has its merit, ie the word which is the samobhavana, is "sky"
 ye hi 'panchabhoot' bhi kehalaate hai
 These four "vibhu" matter are sky, space, space and soul
 manas abhautik parmaanu he or nity bhi he
 Today, tomorrow, this time, that time, month, year, etc
 is the simple reason for the behavior of time - that is time
 kaal nity or vyapak he
 The peculiar cause of the directions, directions, east, west, north, south, etc
, is "trouble"
 yah bhi nity tathaa vyapak he
 The form of soul and mind is the same as that of justice here
 gunakarya kaa asamavayikaran "gun" he
 Rupa, rasa, smell, touch, number, magnitude, separation, coincidence, divisions, divinity, immaturity, gravity, fluidity, affection, words, knowledge, pleasure, sorrow, desire, malice, effort, religion, unrighteousness and samskara
 There are differences of merit
 inamen se rup, gandh, ras, sparsh, sneh, swaabhaavik dravatv, shabd tathaa gyaan se lekar sanskaar paryant, ye "vaisheshik gun" hai, avshisht saadhaaran gun hai
 The qualities remain in matter
 karmkriya ko "karm" kehete hai
 Throwing up, throwing down, shrinking, spreading and moving, such as travel, pulsing, catharsis, etc
, are the differences of the five "karma"
 karm dravya hi main rahata he
 In general, because of the same intelligence that is present in many objects, the "this is this" in each component is the same type of intelligence, the reason is the "normal" in it, which is called "fast" in front of the object's name
 Goes, such as - components, patency
 "tv" se us jati ke antargat sabhi vyaktiyon kaa gyaan hota he
 It is regular and lives in matter, quality and action
 adhik sthaan main rahanevaala "saamaanya", "parasaamaanya" yaa "sattasamanya" yaa "par satta" kaha jaataa he
 The common substance, quality and deeds reside in all three
 prayek vastu main rahanevaala tathaa avyapak jo saamaanya ho, vah "apper saamaanya" yaa "saamaanya vishesh" kaha jaataa he
 Separating one object from another means normal
 visheshadravyon ke antim vibhaag main rahanevaala tathaa nity dravyon main rahanevaala "vishesh" kehalaata he
 This is the only substance that distinguishes between continents
 yah anant he
 There is a kind of relationship, which ties between the ingredients and the ingredients, the virtues and the virtues, the verb and the functional caste and the person and the special and continual matter
 vah ek he or nity bhi he
 The absence of something is called "absence" of that object
 iske chaar bhed hai - "prag abhaav" kaary utpann hon ke pehle kaaran main us kary kaa na rahanaa, "pradhwans abhaav" kaary ke naash hone par us kaary kaa na rahanaa, "atyant abhaav" teenon kaalon main jiskaa sarvatha abhaav ho, jaise vandhya kaa putr tathaa "anyonya abhaav" paraspar abhaav, jaise ghat main pat kaa na hona tathaa pat main ghat kaa na hona
 All these substances are under theorems of jurisprudence
 isliye nyaayadarshan main inkaa pruthak vichaar nahin he, kintu vaisheshik darshan main to mukhya rup se inkaa vichaar he
 According to the Vaisesika doctrine, attaining real knowledge of these seven substances gives freedom
 in donon samaan tatwon main padaarthon ke swaroop main itnaa bhed rahane par bhi donon darshan ek hi main mili rahete hai, iskaa kaaran he ki donon shastron kaa mukhya prameya he "aatma"
 The nature of the soul is the same in both philosophies
 anya vishay he - usee aatma ke jaanane ke liye upaay
 There is not much difference between these two philosophies
 keval shabdon main tathaa kahin-kahin prakriya main bhed he
 There is no difference in fruit
 atev nyaayamat ke anusaar pramaan, prameya aadi solah padaarthon ke tatvagyan se donon se ek hi prakaar kii "mukti" milti he
 Both have the same point of view
 nyaay vaisheshik mat main prithvi, jal, tejas tathaa vaayu inhen chaar dravyon kaa kaary rup main bhi astitv he
 In the opinion of these people, all the working substances are destroyed and they live in the sky in an atomic form
 yahi avasthaa "pralay" kehalaati he
 In this state, every individual soul exists with its mind and with the rites of deeds of previous births, and with religion and unrighteousness in the invisible form
 paratu is samay sristi kaa koi kaary nahin hota
 As a matter of fact, all things are waiting for the time when all the invincible functions of the organisms are ready to transform into form
 parantu adrusht jad he, sharir ke na hone se jeevatma bhi koi kaary nahin kar sakati, parmaanu aadi sabhi jad hai, phir "sristi" ke liye kriya kis prakaar utpann ho? In response to this, it should be known that for the welfare of the creatures that arise, a desire to create in the divine arises, due to which the unrivaled functions of the creatures become oriented
 parmaanuon main e prakaar kii kriya utpann ho jaati he, jisase ek parmaanu, duusare parmaanu se sanyukt ho jate hai
 a "mass" is produced by the addition of two atoms
 parthiv sharir ko utpann karne ke liye jo do parmaanu ikatthe hote hai ve parthiv parmaanu hai
 Both of them are synonyms of the "davanukas" generated
 un donon kaa sanyog asamavayikaaran he or adrusht, ishwar kii ichha, aadi nimittkaaran hai
 Similarly, aquatic, tajas etc
 should be understood in relation to the body
 yah samaran rakhana chahie ki sajaateey donon parmaanu maatr hi se sristi nahin hoti
 He is accompanied by an alien atom, such as an aqueous atom
 "dravyanuk" main anu-pariman he isliye vah drushtigochar nahin hota
 The work that will be generated from "the world" will also be atomic scale and that too will not be visible
 atev davyanuk se sthool kaary dravya ko utpann karne ke liye "teen sankhya" kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 In the nyaya-vaiseshika, gross matter is produced from matter and three numbers
 isliye yahan davyanuk kii teen sankhya se sthool dravya "tryanuk" yaa "trasarenu" kii utpatti hoti he
 The four triangles generate a quadrangle
 isi kram se pruthivi tathaa parthiv dravyon kii utpatti hoti he
 After the creation of matter, properties also arise in it
 yahi sristi kii prakriya he
 All the things that arise in the world are for the enjoyment of all the organisms that are born
 apane purvajanm ke karmon ke prabhaav se jeev sansar main utpann hota he
 In the same way, his body, vagina, clan, country, etc
 are all suited to enjoyment
 jab vah vishesh bhoga samaapt ho jaataa he, tab uski mrityu hoti he
 Similarly, at the end of their enjoyment, all living beings die
 nyaayamat - "sanhaar" ke liye bhi ek kram he
 In action, that is, in ghat, an action is produced in its components due to the strike
 us kriya se uske avyavon main vibhaag hota he, vibhaag se avyavi ke aarambhk sanyogon kaa naash hota he
 And then the component is destroyed
 isi kram se ishwar kii ichha se samast kaary dravyon kaa ek samay naash ho jaataa he
 It is clear from this that the termination of the termite is destroyed by the destruction of non-seasonal
 kabhi samavayikaaran ke naash se bhi kaarydravya kaa naash hota he
 Their aim is that the destroyed work cannot be destroyed without reason
 atev sristi kii tarah sanhaar ke liye bhi parmaanu main hi kriya utpann hoti he or parmaanu to nity he, uskaa naash nahin hota, kintu do parmaanuon ke sanyog kaa naash hota he or phir usase utpann "dravyanuk" rup kaary kaa tathaa usee kram se "tryanuk" evam "chaturanuk" tathaa anya kaaryon kaa bhi naash hota he
 According to macro vision, natural people do not think so subtle
 unke mat main aghat maatr hi se ek baargi sthool dravya nasht ho jaataa he
 Its properties are destroyed when the work material is destroyed
 isamen bhi purvawat do mat hai jinka nirupan "pakaj prakriya" main kiya gaya he
 Like the Nyaya Mantra, in the Vesic opinion, intellect, achievement, knowledge and suffix are words of similar meaning
 anya darshanon main ye sabhi shabd bhinn bhinn paribhaashik arth main prayukt hote hai
 Though there are many distinctions of the intellect, it has two distinct distinctions - "vidya" and "avidya", Avidya has four distinctions - Skepticism, Opportunity, non-business and Dream
 sanshay tathaa viparyay kaa nirupan nyaay main kiya gaya he
 There is no difference in their meaning in the Vaisesika faith
 anishchayatmak gyaan ko "anadhyavsaay" kehete hai
 For example, when looking at jackfruit, the narcotic islanders are suspicious of what it is when they see a cow with a cow, a cow, etc
 din bhar kaary karne se sharir ke sabhi ang thak jate hai
 They require rest
 indreu visheshkar thak jaati hai or man main leen ho jaati he
 Then the mind goes to rest in the full pulse through the psychotic pulse
 vahaan pahunchne ke pehle, purvakarmon ke sanskaron ke kaaran tathaa vaat, pitt or kaph in teenon ke vaishamy ke kaaran, adrusht ke sahare us samay man ko anek prakaar ke vishyon kaa pratyaksh hota he, jise swapngyaan kehete hai
 It should be kept in mind here that in the Vaisesika faith, "avidya" has been kept under knowledge and hence "avidya" is also called "false Knowledge"
 bahuton kaa kahana he ki ye donon shabd paraspar viruddh he
 The knowledge which is false cannot be called knowledge and the knowledge which is false can never be called false
 vidya bhi chaar prakaar kii he - pratyaksh, anumaan, smriti tathaa aarsh
 It is to be kept in mind here that "memory" in justice is not called realism
 vah to gyaat hi kaa gyaan he
 Similarly, "aarash Gyan" is not considered to be impermanent
 naiyayikon ke shabd yaa aagam ko anumaan main tathaa upmaan ko pratyaksh main vaisheshikon ne antarbhoot kiya he
 The sages who created the Veda have the knowledge of the past and the future as the direct
 usamen indriya or arth ke sannikarsh kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 This is called "pratibha" knowledge or "arshgyan"
 yah gyaan vishuddh at:karanwale jeev main bhi kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he
 Like - a pious girl says - tomorrow my brothers will come and literally tomorrow their brothers come
 yah "pratibh gyaan" he
 There is no difference of opinion between the two philosophies in the idea of direct and conjecture
 isliye pun: inkaa vichaar yahan nahin kiya gaya
 a very detailed discussion of karma has been done in Vaiseshika philosophy
 nyaay darshan main kahe gaye "karm" ke paanch bhedon ko ye log bhi unheen arthon main sweekaar karte hai
 These people have actually called the physical efforts "karma"
 phir bhi sabhi cheshtaayen praytn ke taratamya hi se hoti hai
 Therefore, in Vaiseshika philosophy, there are some karmas with regard to each of the above five distinctions and the effort in the tradition, which are called "sattrayatya-karma", some are without effort, which are called "aspatriya-karma"
 inke atirikt kuch aise karm hote hai, jaise prithvi aadi mahabhuton main, jo bina kisi praytn ke hote hai, unhen "apratyay-karm" kehete hai

 kreemia kaa yuddh tak kaala sagar ke aasapaas chalaa yuddh tha, jisamen france, britain, sardenia, turki ne ek taraf tathaa rus ne duusari taraf se ladaa tha
 The 'battle of Crimea' is considered one of the most foolish and inconclusive wars in history
 yuddh kaa kaaran slavvaadi rashtriyata kii bhaavana thi
 Apart from this, on the other hand, the religious atrocities of Turkey also became the cause, but even after very bloodshed, nothing came out

 In those days, people in European countries had the impression that Russia has so much weapons that it is invincible

 Russia's policy of expanding the state towards Kustantunia had been in place since the time of Peter the Great
 apni is rajyavistaar kii aakankshapurti ke liye vah koi na koi bahaanaa dhoondhata rahata tha
 This war is considered to be the first such war in which the public got the news of daily battle
 da times akhbaar ke wiliam rasel or roger fenton ne patr main is ladaai kaa vivaran diya tha
 This war began with a small religious dispute
 un dinon philistin, turki samrajya ke antargat tha
 In 1535, the Sultan of Turkey entrusted the care of the shrines of Roman Christians to the French Catholic priests under the patronage of France
 isi prakaar turki sthit unani-isai sampradaay ke dharmik sthaan rus ke jaar ke sangrakshan main die gaye the
 But during the time of the famous French revolution, France could not pay proper attention to its responsibility
 dhire dhire latin dharmasthanon par unani-isai sampradaay ke saadhuon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 In 1850, Française Napoleon III turned his attention to the Latin Church; He wrote to Turkey to give his management under the patronage of France
 1852 i
 main usne apni is maang ko duharaaya
 The Sultan of Turkey accepted this demand of France after a few handover
 rus ke liye koi kaaran na tha ki vah turki ke is kaary par aapatti karata; kintu usne ise turki ko hadap lene kaa ek acha avasar samajha
 In favor of the greek-christian denomination, the Tsar wrote to the Sultan to return the Latin religious places to him
 isse england ashankit ho uthaa
 He feared that once Russia's authority over Kustuntunia would be a permanent threat to India from the land route and it would be such a danger that it would not be possible for him to face it in any way
 vah rus ke viruddh turki kii sahaayta ke liye uth khadaa hua
 There was a clear reason for France to be angry
 rus uske tirthasthalon kii dekhbhaal ke adhikaar main hastkshep kar rahaa he
 But the greater reason was that Czar Nicholas i addressed the new Emperor of France as 'brother' rather than 'brother'
 isaliye rus ke unani-isai sampradaay kaa pakshdhar banate dekh use apane rajvansh par khatra aata dikhaai padaa
 Austria was also alarmed by the Russian aggression towards the Balkans

 main austrianaresh ko apana paitruk singhaasana roosi sainik sahaayta se praapt hua tha, tathaapi is avasar par rus kii kritagyata maananaa or chup baithe rahanaa uchit nahin jaan padaa
 He started leaning towards France and England
 usne british rajdoot ke ishaare par rus kii chunauti ko thukraa diya
 The result of this was to happen
 july, 1853 main rus kii sena ne kooch bol diya or danyube nadi ke uttarvarti turki ke bhubhag-moldavia or balesia ke praanton par aadhikaar kar liya
 Immediately a joint naval fleet of England and France reached Basphorus to assist Turkey; But in view of the English and French warships, the Russian navy near Sinope destroyed the Turkish fleet
 tab janvari,1854 i
 ke anrabh main england or france kaa sanyukt bedaa kalasagar main ghusaa or donon deshon ne sheeghra hi rus ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di
 He planned to make his defensive war
 kustutuniya kii raksha ke liye unhone galipoli main kilabandi karne kaa nishchay kiya
 But before the anglo-french forces gathered at Varna on the west coast of Kalasagar, Russia withdrew its forces from the occupied territories of Turkey, seeing Austria's friendly stand
 is prakaar rus dwaara turki par akraman kii sambhaavna samaapt ho gai
 As a result, the situation in England and France became skewed

 The army could not be left there
 duusari ore bina yuddh kiye apni sena ko swadesh lautaa le janaa donon hi desh ke shaskaon kaa apni hinata kaa dyotak jaan padaa
 So, in the interest of doing something, he decided to attack Crimea
 uske dakshini tat par sevastopol main rus kaa nausenic adda tha
 He made it his goal to do it in authority
 durdharsh nirnay to in donon deshon ne le liya par uname se kisi ko bhi kreemia ke bhubhag ke sambandh main koi jaankaree na thi
 When the ardent France experienced this difficulty, she summoned the soul of the Napoleonic great at Planchet and asked for his advice
 rephet ne sevastopol or balklawa ke jo maanchitr taiyaar kiye the unka adhyayan-manan kiya gaya; ranvyuuh-visheshgy jaimini se salaah lee gai kintu koi utsahjanak baat saamne nahin aari
 Only the possibilities of failure were realized
 idhar british mantrimandal ko kisi prakaar ke gambhir chintan kii aavashyaktaa nahin jaan padi
 He looked at the map of Crimea in the usual way and said that it is not a difficult task to cut off the peninsula of Crimea from the mainland by blocking the degree of landmass on the strength of cannons
 unhen tab tak is baat kaa gyaan na tha ki sthaldam degree ke donon ore samudr main do-teen foot se adhik jal nahin he
 He issued orders for the war
 14 sitambar ko senaayen upotoria pahaunchi
 On 17 September, he started Sevastopol and started growing
 20 sitambar ko unhone roosi sena ko haraaya kintu kisi prakaar kaa koi nirnaayak parinaam nahin niklaa
 Russian commander Tadelbein entered the fortress of Sevastopol and made full preparations to protect the fort
 aangl-french sena ne durg par gheraa daal diya
 Before they could take any further action, winter came before it; In the absence of proper food and food system, the soldiers were in a miserable condition

 The invention of wire facilitated quick contact connectivity
 at: donon deshon ke mukhyalayon se jo aadesh das din main pahonchte the ab 24 ghante main pahunchne lage
 England and France used this feature differently
 england ke liye sainik asafalataa kaa arth mantrimandal main ulatpher kii sambhaavna se adhik or kuch na tha
 Therefore, the War Department only used it to express concern for the health of its captain, Javis
 kintu france ke samrat ke liye to haar rajvansh ke vinaash kaa paigaam tha
 Hence, he began to send daily suggestions, advice and orders to his commander
 falat: donon hi deshon ke senapatiyon ko taron ke is prakaar ke aadan-pradaan ke kaaran mej se uthakar or kuch karne or sochane kii fursat hi nahin rahi
 Nevertheless, by April, they tried to speed up the circle of Sevastopol
 june main angareji sena ne radon par or francisi sena ne melecalf par akraman kiya parantu roosiyon ne donon hi akramanon ko vifal kar diya
 But when the anglo-french army took over Kinburn, Russia considered it futile to continue the war
 is samay tak french naresh napolian bhi is yuddh se ghabara uthaa tha
 He was not in favor of further war
 kintu angarej, jinhen sevastopol ke akraman main asafalataa mili thi, khize hue the
 They wanted to continue the war but it was not enough for them to fight Russia alone
 nidaan paris main ek sandhi hui
 Among other things in this treaty, the main thing was that the Danube River opened up traffic for ships of all countries; Kala Sagar was declared a neutral zone; The warships of each country were prohibited

 The Crimea War was an important event in European history after the Vienna Congress
 is yuddh ke falswarup ek ore jahaan rus kii turki sambandhi yojana vifal ho gai vahiin duusari ore turki ko nav jivan praapt hua
 The Politics of Italy and Germany Unification of Russia This war had a profound effect on the complete construction of the Balkan Peninsula and on international politics
 is yuddh ke kai kaaran the
 which is like this
 rusi niti- In the 19th century, the Turkish empire was declining
 isse phayda uthaakar vibhinn europea raashtra use aapas main baantna chaahate the
 Russia was very particular about it
 vah turki ke maamle main gahari abhiruchi lene laga
 Russia wanted ki turki kamjor pad jaae taaki balcon kshetra main apni samrajya kaa vistaar kar sake
 Therefore, he provoked the subjects of the Balkan Peninsula to agitate against Turkey
 rus kaa uddeshy turki ko samaapt karnaa tha
 And on the ruins of the Turkish Empire, he wanted to build the palace of the huge Russian Empire
 is liye jab bhi mauka mila rus europea ke saamana turki ke batwaare kaa prastaav rakhata tha
 Britain's selfishness england rus kii mahatvakanksha kaa prabal virdohi tha
 Because Russia's entry into the land of the Sea could pose a crisis for England
 saath hi saath turki par rus kaa adhikaar hone se england kaa bhartiya samrajya bhi khatre main pad saktaa tha
 Therefore, he had an important role to protect Turkey from going under the authority of Russia for the protection of the Indian Empire
 england kabhi nahin chahta tha ki purv kii ore uskaa vistaar ho
 Although Russia tried to join England, it could not succeed
 vibhinn prayaason ke baad bhi jab englad rus ke paksh main nahin ho sakaa to use talwaar ke bal par turki ko hadapney kii yojana bananaa shuru kar di
 Selfishness of france europe ke biimaar raashtra turki par france kii najar bhi lagi hui thi
 Louis Napoleon wanted to expand France through war policy
 usne turki ke maamle main hastkshep karnaa shuru kiya
 The Crimean War began as a result of Napoleon's policy
 mohammal ali kaa vidroh or europea rashtron kaa turki main hastkshep- Mohammed Ali was the governor of Mishra
 jo turki samrajya ke adhin tha
 But Mohammad Ali was an independent ruler
 yunaan ke swatantraaa sangram main turki ko sahaayta dene ke babajood use koi laabh nahin hua tha
 Therefore, he took military action against Syria
 isapar turki kaa shultan ghabara gaya
 He received help from Russia
 isse vibhinn rashtron main bejaini bad gai or pramukh europea deshon ne rusi sena ko waapas karnaa ke liye turki par yah dabaav daalana shuru kiya ki ve mohammad ali ke saath samjhauta kar le
 As a result, Mohammed Ali was given Syria
 idhar rus apni sahaayta ke badale turki se kuch naa kuch puraskaar chahta tha
 In 1832 he entered into a treaty with Turkey by which Russia's influence over Turkey was established
 is ghatana se england chintit ho gaya usne europea rajyon kaa landan main ek sammelan bulaayaa
 All nations signed a treaty
 falat: turki par rus kaa prabhaav kuch kam ho gaya
 After this, peace was maintained for about ten years, but when Louis Napoleon came to France, he started raising the eastern problem by favoring the clergy of the Christianity of Russia
 The Crimea War was the result of it
 dharmik kaaran- The Holy Jerusalem of Christ was under the Turkish Empire
 vahaan roman or unani carch ke sanyasi rahete the
 The Turkish Sultan's dealings with them were not good, so according to the Treaty of 1742, the protection of the Roman monk was placed on Russia
 parantu france ke kranti ke falswarup jab france main avyavashtha fail gai
 So the Greek clergy started attacking the Roman Church
 lui nepolian ne roman padri kaa samarpan karnaa shuru kiya or rus ne unani padri kaa saath dena shuru kiya
 Hence, the Eastern problem started deteriorating
 teen varshon tak is samasya ko lekar europe main kutniti tanaav vyaapt rahaa
 Russia remained a diplomatic strain in Europe
 rus dharmik bahaanaa bana kar turki par akraman kar uske pradeshon par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 In 1853, Russia invaded Turkey and conquered Noldavia and Belesia
 rus par england or fransane turki ko sahaayta dene kaa aashwasan diya turki ko sahaayta dene kaa aashwasan diya 27 farvari 1854 ko england or france ne rus ko sanyukt chetavanee di ki rus turki kaa pradesh khaali kar de
 But due to lack of satisfaction, both of them declared war on Russia
 yahi yuddh kreemia kaa yuddh tha
 In which England, France and Turkey on one side and Russia alone was completely alone, this war lasted for two years
 dhan jan kii apaar kshati hui
 Russia had a massive defeat
 march 1856 main paris ke sandhi ke dwaara yuddh samaapt hua
 Thus the victory of the Egyptian nations and the defeat of Russia took place in the war
 30 march 1856 ko england, france, austria, turki, servia tathaa rus ke pratinidhiyon ne paris sandhi par hastakshar kiya
 Accordingly, the neutral zone of Kalsagar was declared

 Russia's protection over the Mol Divia and Bolegia was abolished

 Turkey was included in the nation group of Europe

 The Crimean War is considered an important event in European history

 Robert Marriott described it as a total futile war of the modern era, he wrote
 “the only perfectly useless modern war that has been waged
” iske vipareet lard kromar kaa kahana he
 "if the Crimea war had not taken place, the suzerainty of Russia would have been established over Turkey", Dr
 M
 Kedelvi wrote ‘kreemia yuddh ke falswarup rus kii turki sambandhi yojanaon ko roak diya gaya
 Russia had a massive defeat
 turki ko europe ke sangrakshan main nav jivan mila nepolin kii dhak jam gai
 The national debt of England increased and Austria made an enemy of a great country

 After the Crimea War, the fall of Turkey was inevitable
 servia ko swatantraaa pradaan kii gai
 It proved to be a source of inspiration for other subjugated countries
 or videshi apni swadhinata ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe
 The main objective of the Crimean War was to weaken Russia
 parantu yah uddeshy bhi safal nahin ho sakaa
 Thinking that Russia would calm down further proved to be wrong
 mauka milte hi vah purv samasya main pun: kud padaa paris kii sandhi kaa uddeshy rusi mahatvakankshaon par ankush lagaana tha or turki ko jivit karnaa tha parantu yah bhi pari nahin ho sakaa
 Hence it can be said
 ki jin uddeshyon kii purti ke liye yuddh ladaa gaya tha
 From that point of view it proved futile
 england yaa france kisi ko laabh nahin pahunchaa
 But despite this, Crimea war cannot be called a total futile war

 He joined the nation group of Europe

 Russia's fear ended

 jis prakaar sena kii paraajay ke baad sainik purna gathan hua usee prakaar rus kaa purnnirmaan bhi hua yah rus ke itihaaskaar kii mahatvapurn ghatana he
 Because after this defeat, there was widespread improvement here, but the most important result of the Crimea War was that its dream of conquering Kustuntunia and making the Black Sea a Russian lake was dissolved
 england par prabhaav- The purpose of England in this war was fulfilled
 rus ke vistaar par pratibandh lag gaya lekin isse england ko dhan jan kii apaar kshati hui uskaa rashtrikar baad diya gaya jisase sudhaar yojanaayen ko lagu karne main kathinaayee hui
