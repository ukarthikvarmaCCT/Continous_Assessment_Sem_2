 But this does not mean that the essay is a disorderly creation and the essayist is a disorderly person

 unhone vam dal main loktantric hausale ko jinda rakhaa or us andolan ko prerit kiya jisase kerala bharat kaa pehla purna sakshar rajya ban gaya
 One of the best leaders of the Indian Communist movement, the country's leading Marxist thinker and the creator of modern Kerala, Elamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad's personality was made up of a combination of high-level theoretical skills and activism
 darshan, saundaryashastra, bhashashastra, itihaas, arthshaastra or raajnneeti jaise vividh anushasano main nabbe se zyaada ullekhneey pustakon kaa yogadan karne se lekar aadhi sadi tak communist party kii disha tay karne vaale iemes kaa naam unke jivan main hi desh kii rajdhani se lekar kerala ke kisi bhi maamuli gaanv tak main prasiddh ho chukaa tha
 Due to the 'ekya Kerala' campaign led by him, Kerala was formed on linguistic basis after independence

 Namboodir Tipad had played a key role in making Kerala the leader of coalition politics 
 aaj agar kerala desh kaa sarvaadhik sakshar or jaagruk praant he to iskaa shrey iemes ke kaarykaal main kiye gayi radical bhoomi or shiksha-sudhaaron ko hi jaataa he
 Namboodiripada's autobiography, published in 1968, is considered the best prose of modern Malayalam
 kerala main pragatisheel saahitiyik-saanskrithik andolan kii shuruyaat or vikaas main unki pramukh bhoomika thi
 By deep study of Malayali society and politics, he adopted a dialectical attitude towards caste-problem and designed a special kind of Marxist politics
 parinamswaroop na keval communist party ko kerala ke samaaj main apane kadam jamaane kaa mauka mila, balki puure malayalam samaaj main hi aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya chal nikali
 EMS Namboodiripad was born in Elamkulam village of Perinthalamanna taluk in present-day Mallapuram district
 unke pita parameshwaran bade jameendaar the
 In youth, the reform movement against Namboodiripad caste system was attracted towards the movement
 pragatisheel namboodiri ne yuvak sanghathan 'valluvanadu yogakshem sabha' ke padaadhikari ke rup main jam kar kaam kiya
 In a period when most communist theorists were trying to see Indian history fit into the bookish Marxist mold, Namboodiripad demonstrated the unique originality and analyzed Kerala's social structure as 'caste-born-neduvazhi meritorious'
 apni pehali ullekhneey rachana 'kerala : malayalaikalode mathrubhumi' main iemes ne dikhaaya ki saamaajik sambandhon par unchi jatiyaan haaavee hai, utpaadan sambandh janamaa yani zameendaaron ke haathon main hai or prashasan kii bagdor neduvasiyon yani sthaneey prabhuon ke kabze main he
 This equation was the reason for the poverty and backwardness of most of the public in ems's view
 apane isi vishleshan ko aadhaar bana kar namboodiripad ne 1952 main 'da naishanal queshchan in kerala', 1967 main 'kerala : yasterde, today and tumaaro' or 1984 main 'kerala socity and politics : a historical survey' kii rachana kii
 On the basis of this analysis, EMS also prepared the agenda of the Left to break the nexus of 'caste-born-neduvazhi Medhavitam' in Kerala, which had social reform and anti-caste movement at its center
 iemes ne jor de kar kaha ki jatigat shoshan ne kerala kii namboodiri jaisi sheersh brahman jati tak kaa amanavikaran kar diya he
 He campaigned for the democratization of the Brahmin community by giving the slogan 'make Namboodiri an Insan'

 In this way, in communist terminology, the land of anti-feudal democratic mass struggles was created
 iemes ne dakshin kerala kii travankor or cochin riyasaton main samantvaad virdohi sangharsh or british shasit ilaakon main samrajyavad virdohi sangharsh kaa sanshray taiyaar kiya
 When the caste-reform movement lost its radical edge and got entangled in narrow bandits, Namboodiripad began to separate the mass movements and the caste movements

 Meanwhile, Namboodiripad composed 'A Short History of the Peasant Movement in Kerala'

 Just before independence, in 1945 Namboodiripad wrote a booklet titled 'A Crore and a Quarter Malayali'
 us samay tak kerala kii janata cochin, travankor or malabar ilaakon main banti hui thi
 This booklet became the basis of 'ekya Keralam'
 1952 main 'da neshnal queshchan in kerala' likh kar namboodiripad ne sari duniya kaa dhyaan apni ore aakarshith kiya
 Through this creation, he presented the democratic claim of Malayali identity in the era of anti-colonial struggle
 1957 main hue kerala vidhaan sabha ke liye pehle aam chunaav main namboodiripad ke netritv main communist party ne jabardast jeet hasil kii
 As the first non-congress Chief Minister of the country, he changed the education system of the state

 In 1959, the central government of Nehru dissolved the government of EMS using Article 356 of the Constitution controversially
 lekin 1967 main saat partiyon ke gathjod ke netaa ke taur par iemes dobaaraa sattarudh hue
 After this, the politics of Kerala became a competition of two alliances led by the Congress and the Communist Party
 pehle mukhyamantri or phir kareeb dedh dashak tak vidhaan sabha main vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main namboodiripad ne gathjod raajnneeti ke vyavhaar or siddhanth kaa shaastra rachaa
 The aspect of developing joint front strategy in Indian parliamentary politics in general and in communist movement in particular will be remembered as his major contribution

 The presence of] in their nexus was its practical culmination

 One aspect of the cause of the widespread influence of this comic series is the lack of details of its social or political interpretation; While this was Davis's original intent, he also acknowledged that his political grip was not as strong, "commenting for years that he thought" OPEC) is the artificial pasting glue that affixes both "

 John's father drives his tractor to town and brings a rooster to wake him up
 jaisaaki garfield ko bhojan ke prati pyaar he, ve aksar baahar restaraan main khaane ke liye jaaya karte hai
 The end of most trips is embarrassing because Garfield will eat too much, or John will do some stupid stuff, including wearing an ugly shirt, when one night he takes Liz on a date
 jab jon liz ko date par le jaataa he, garfield hameshaa saath chipak jaataa he or ek baar to vah roti par bhar gaya
 Often, the character breaks the fourth wall to explain something to the readers, talking about a subject that often retains the flow of the strip's clownishness, or does so to give a mere sparkle when a character's importance diminishes

 On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the biggest birthday present: "I got rid of snacks!" Sometimes the strip celebrates Halloween with creepy themed jokes such as comic masks
 isamen bhi mausami chutkule hai, janvari yaa farvari ke maheenon main barf se sambandhit hasya-vyangy or samudr tat yaa garmi kii theme par garmiyon ke chutkule
 a plot, prior to Halloween that ran all week from October 23 to October 28 in 1989, is not meant to be considered humorous in Garfield's strips

 His title: State in its entirety During a writing session for Halloween, i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips
 i wanted to scare people
 And what do people fear most? Why, being alone
 We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers
 Reaction ranged from 'right on!' to 'this isn't a trend, is it?' a recurring plot involves Garfield losing or running away

 Garfield goes out to fetch it, but he guesses what will happen if he keeps wandering - and decides to find out

 He soon realizes his mistake
 John leaves alone, so he announces an award for Garfield and Odie's return

 Possibly, to keep the memory of the same dynasty tradition, the raj has been divided into eighteen strongholds

 Thus it was mandatory to have at least eighty-four villages in each stronghold

 Since the kingdom belonged to the sun dynasty, the number of talukas and villages was kept at seven and at least twelve respectively keeping in mind the rays of the sun and the twelve zodiac signs

 His political history has developed independently
 " In 1896, Zeman examined the sodium flame by placing it between two poles of a strong electromagnet and discovered that both sharp yellow lines of the spectrum widened somewhat
 yadi varnakramdarshi kii vibhedan-kshamta kaafii adhik ho to chumbakeey kshetra main rakhe prakaash strot kii prayek varnakram rekha kai ghatak rekhaon main vibhajit ho jaati he
 This phenomenon is called the Zeman effect
 san 1892 main farade ne yahi prabhaav dekhne kaa asafal praytn kiya tha
 The absorbing lines divide into components when the absorber medium is placed in a magnetic field
 ise vyutkram zemaan prabhaav kehete hai
 To see the Zeeman effect, spectral lines are inspected by the addition of a device with a high differential potential, such as the Lumer – Gehrke board and the rule deviation spectrograph
 chumbakiyashetra kii abhilamb disha main nirikshan se anuprasthadrishy tathaa samaantar disha main nirikshan se anudairdhya drishy, praapt hota he
 a longitudinal view requires a groove or tunnel parallel to the magnetic field in the middle of a pole of the magnet
 lorents ne apane dravya or vikiran ke electron siddhant ke aadhaar par isaki vyakhya kii or yah bhavishyavaanee ko ki ye varnakram rekhaayen chumbakeey kshetra dwaara dhruvit ho jaani chahie
 In longitudinal view these lines should have circular polarization and transverse angle should have linear polarization
 in bhavishyavaaniyon kaa zemaan ne satyaapan kiya
 Lorents showed by his theory that when looking at the spectral line of light perpendicular to the magnetic field, three component lines should be visible
 zemaan prabhaav main jab uparyukt visthaapan par keval teen ghatak rekhaayen dekhin jaayan, use prakrut zemaan prabhaav kehete hai tathaa un ghatak rekhaon ke namoonay kaa prakrut trik yaa lorents trik kehete hai
 But when a spectral line divides into many more component lines, it is called the unaudited Zeeman effect, because it cannot be interpreted on the basis of the iconic principle
 prakrut zemaan trik vishesh rup he or ekak shrenee kii varnakram rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he, jabaki praarambhik or antim urja dasha kaa lande gunank ek ke baraabar hota he
 Ordinary Lorents were seen in the spectrum of tri-zinc and cadmium, and the measurement of their frequencies, and the magnitude of e / m by the above formula, was found to be equal to the e / m ejected by the negative rays
 yah parinaam aikya tathaa anudairdhyadrishy main vrittiya dhruvan ke ghumaav kii prekshit disha, is baat kaa pramaan hai ki parmanviya varnakram main vikiran chalyman rinatmak vidyut aavesh dwaara nikalataa he
 Preston established by using devices with greater deflection and differentiation capability that the sample of ground-component-lines of a specific range of the same spectral lines was of the same type and characterized by that category
 is prakaar zemaan prabhaav varnakram vishleshan kaa vishisht saadhan ban gaya
 In 1907 Rouge showed that the displacement of the component lines of unmodified Zemann samples can be manifested as the displacement product of the natural triplet lines
 udaahranarth ke p or s ghatakon kaa visthaapan or lorents ikaiyaan hoga
 For this it will be displacement Lorents units

 This effect was noticed by Paschon and Beck in 1912 and found that in a much more intense magnet field, the natural Zeman component sample turns to the natural Zeman component sample natural Zeman triad
 isi liye zemaan prabhaav varnakram vishleshan or parmaanuon or yanon kii electron rachana kaa pataa lagane kaa mukhya saadhan he
 Some interesting properties in the Sun and stars can only be discovered with the help of the Zeman effect

 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a freedom fighter of India
 bharat kii aazaadee ke baad ve pratham grih mantri or up-pradhanmantri bane
 Patel, who was leading the Bardoli Satyagraha, conferred the title of Sardar on the success of Satyagraha
 aazaadee ke baad vibhinn riyasaton main bikhare bharat ke bhu-raajnneetik ekikaran main kendriya bhoomika nibhaane ke liye patel ko bharat kaa bismark or louh purush bhi kaha jaataa he
 Patel was born in Nadiad, Gujarat into a Leuva / Leva Gurjar farming family

 Somabhai, Narasibhai and Vittalbhai were his forefathers
 unki shiksha mukhyatah swadhyay se hi hui
 Going to London, he studied barrister and came back and practiced in Ahmedabad
 mahatma gandhi ke vichaaron se prerit hokar unhone bharat ke swatantrata aandolan main bhaag liya
 Sardar Patel's first and foremost contribution to the freedom movement was in the Kheda struggle
 gujarat kaa kheda khand un dino bhayankar sookhe kii chapet main tha
 The peasants demanded heavy tax exemption from the British government
 jab yah sweekaar nahin kiya gaya to sardaar patel, gandhiji evam anya logon ne kisaanon kaa netritv kiya or unhe kar na dene ke liye prerit kiya
 Finally, the government bowed down and provided relief in taxes that year

 He was assigned the work of Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister
 kintu iske baad bhi nehru or patel ke sambandh tanaavpurn hi rahe
 Due to this, both of them had threatened to renounce their posts on several occasions
 grih mantri ke rup main unki pehali praathamikta desi riyasaton ko bharat main milaanaa tha
 He edited it without shedding any blood

 After this, there was very little opposition from Nehru within the Congress
 sardaar patel ne aazaadee ke thik purv hi pivi menon ke saath milakar kai desi rajyon ko bharat main milaane ke liye kaary armbh kar diya tha
 Patel and Menon explained a lot to the indigenous kings that it would not be possible to give them autonomy

 Only the kings of Jammu and Kashmir, Junagadh and Hyderabad did not agree to do so

 When the Nizam of Hyderabad rejected the proposal for merger with India, Sardar Patel sent the army there and surrendered the Nizam

 Although both of them went to England and obtained a degree in barrister, Sardar Patel was far ahead of Pt
 Nehru in advocacy and he was the first place among the students of the entire British Empire
 nehru praaia: sochate rahete the, sardaar patel use kar daalate the
 Nehru was a scholar of scriptures, Patel was a priest of arms
 patel ne bhi oonchi shiksha pai thi parantu unamem kinchit bhi ahankaar nahin tha
 He himself used to say, "I did not fly high in the great sky of art or science
 meraa vikaas kachi jhopadiyon main garib kisaan ke kheton kii bhoomi or shaharon ke gande makaanon main hua he
 "pandit Nehru was irritated with the filth and life of the village

 After the independence of the country, Sardar Patel was the Deputy Prime Minister, along with the Minister of Home, Information and State Department
 sardaar patel kii mahanatam dein thi 562 choti-badi riyasaton kaa bhartiya sangh main vilinikaran karke bhartiya ekta kaa nirmaan karnaa
 There has not been a single person in the history of the world who has dared to integrate such a large number of states

 They were called the salute state, that is, when someone went to meet them, the cannon was given salute

 After all, by August 15, 1947, except for only three princely states - Kashmir, Junagadh and Hyderabad, that iron man merged all the princely states into India
 in teen riyasaton main bhi junagarh ko 9 navambar 1947 ko mila liya gaya tathaa junagarh kaa nawab pakistan bhaag gaya
 On 13 November, Sardar Patel pledged to rebuild the fractal temple of Somnath, which was built even after intense opposition from Pandit Nehru
 1948 main hyderabad bhi keval 4 din kii police karrwai dwaara mila liya gaya
 There was no bomb, nor any revolution, as it was being intimidated

 Undoubtedly, the integration of 562 princely states by Sardar Patel was a wonder of world history
 bharat kii yah raktahin kranti thi
 Mahatma Gandhi wrote to Sardar Patel about these princely states, "the problem of princely states was so complex that only you could solve it
 " Although the State Department was Pandit Nehru's field office, he was often referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Cabinet as a Deputy Prime Minister
 unki doordarshita kaa laabh yadi us samay liya jaataa to anek vartmaan samasyaon kaa janm na hota
 In a letter to Pandit Nehru in 1950, Patel cautioned China and its policy towards Tibet and described China's attitude as fraudulent and treacherous
 apane patr main china ko apana dushman, uske vyavhaar ko abhadratapurna or china ke patron kii bhashaa ko kisi dost kii nahin, bhavi shatru kii bhashaa kaha tha
 He also wrote that China's occupation of Tibet would give rise to new problems
 1950 main nepal ke sandarbh main likhe patron se bhi pan nehru sahamat na the
 In 1950, after listening to lengthy talks in Goa's two-hour cabinet meeting regarding independence, Sardar Patel only said, "shall we go to Goa, it's only two hours
" " nehru isse bade naaraaz hue the
 If Patel had obeyed, Goa's independence would not have to wait until 1961
 grahamantri ke rup main ve pehle vyakti the jinhone bhartiya naagarik sevaaon kaa bhartiyakaran kar inhen bhartiya prashasnic sevaayen banaaya
 By reposing faith in those who served the British, they turned from patriotism to patriotism
 yadi sardaar patel kuch varsh jivit rahete to sambhavat: naukarshahi kaa purna kayakalp ho jaataa
 While Sardar Patel was cautious about the pseudo and clever tricks of Pakistan, he was also careful about the disruptive elements of the country
 visheshkar ve bharat main muslim lig tathaa communiston kii vibhedakaari tathaa rus ke prati unki bhakthi se sajag the
 Many scholars have said that Sardar Patel was like Bismarck
 lekin landan ke times ne likhaa tha "bismark kii safaltaaen patel ke saamne mahatvaheen rah jaati hai
 Had it been at the behest of Patel, the situation in Kashmir, China, Tibet and Nepal would not have happened today
 patel sahi myanon main manu ke shashan kii kalpana the
 Among them was Kautilya's diplomacy and Maharaj Shivaji's foresight
 ve keval sardaar hi nahin balki bharatiyon ke hriday ke sardaar the
 Sardar Patel, who has continued to lead a life of struggle, did not have the freedom to write independently, but there is great literature available in the form of letters, commentaries and lectures given by him, whose compilation has been published in various forms
 inamen sarvaadhik mahatvapurn to sardaar patel ke ve patr hai jo swatantraaa sangram ke sandarbh main dastavej kaa mahatv rakhte hai
 These letters of the period from 1945 to 1950 A

 were first published in 10 volumes from the Navjivan Prakashan Mandir in Durga Das's editing
 is brihad sankalan main se chune hue patr-vyavhaaron kaa ve0 shankar ke sampadan main do khandon main bhi prakaashan hua, jinka hindi anuwaad bhi prakashit kiya gaya
 In these collections, not only the letters of Sardar Patel but important letters of other persons written to him in those contexts are also compiled
 vibhinn vishyon par kendrit unke vividh roopen likhit sahitya ko sankalit kar anek pustaken bhi taiyaar kii gayi hai
 The details of his overall available literature are as follows: - 31 oktober 2013 ko sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii 137veen jayanti ke maukey par gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ne gujarat ke narmada jile main sardaar vallabh bhai patel ke ek nae smarak kaa shilanyas kiya
 It was decided to erect a huge statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel made of iron here, hence the name of this monument is named 'statue of Unity'
 yah murti 'stachu of liberty' se dugani oonchi banegi
 This proposed statue is to be installed on a small rocky island situated in the middle of the Narmada River in front of the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Kevadia
