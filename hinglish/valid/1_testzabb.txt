, kaladhugi tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke nainital jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Galileo Galilei was a scientist from Italy
 ve ek mahaan avishkaarak the tathaa doordarshee ke vikaas main unka athulaneey sahyog tha
 This great thinker was born into a musician family in the city of Pisa, modern Italy
 aadhunik italy kaa shahar pisa 15 farvari 1564 ke mahaan vaigyanik galileo gallily ke janm ko bhi ishwar kii rachana kaa dosha maanakar aitihaasik bhul kar baitha tha
 The doctrines propounded by Galileo contradicted religious beliefs, for which Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment for trespassing with divine beliefs
 inke pita vincounjo gallily us samay ke jane maane sangeet visheshgy the
 He used to play an instrument called "lute", the same instrument called lute which later evolved into guitar and banjo
 apni sangeet rachana ke dauraan vincounjo gallily ne tani huyi dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaale swaron kaa gahanta se adhyayan kiya tathaa yah paaya ki dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaali aawaaj main sambandh he
 The scientific study of the results of the interrelations of the sounds of the string, or the string, stretched for the music by the father, was done by his son Galileo
 is adhyayan ko karne ke dauraan balak galileo ke man main sugrahita purna prayog karte huye unke parinamo ko aatmsaat karne kii prerana pradaan kii
 He is considered the father of exam oriented science
 inhone dolan kaa sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He invented binoculars
 usne doordarshee yantra ko adhik unnat banaaya
 With his help, he took many astronomical observations and supported the theory of Copernicus
 unhen aadhunik praayogic khagoliki kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He found that the laws of nature are influenced by each other's factors and there is a relation between the increase and decrease of one as in the equations of mathematics
 isaliye unhone kaha kih-‘ ishwar kii bhashaa ganit he
 'this great mathematician and scientist only dared to measure the speed of light
 iske liye galileo or unka ek sahaayak andheri raat main kai mile dur sthit do pahaad kii chotiyon par ja baithe
 From where Galileo lit the lantern, after getting his assistant's signal, they were to indicate the light through the lantern and its knock
 duusari pahari par sthit unke sahaayak ko laalaten kaa prakaash dekhakar apane paas rakhi duusari laalaten kaa khatka hataakar punah sanket karnaa tha
 Thus Galileo had to estimate the speed of light by looking at the light shining on the top of the second mountain
 is prakaar galileo ne jo parinaam paaya vah bahut seemaa tak vaastavik to na tha parantu prayogon kii aavruti or safalataa asafalataa ke baad hi abhisht parinaam paane kii jo muhim unke dwaara prarambh kii gayi vah adwitiya thi
 In due course, Albert Einstein, the great scientist who solved the intricate relationship between the speed of light and the relationship of energy, referred to him as 'father of modern science'
 galileo dharmik pravruth ke the parantu puraani dharmik manyataon ko vivekshiltaa or prayog ke madhyam se sidv karnaa chaahate the
 In the year 1609, Galileo discovered a telescope that was invented in Holland, with the help of this telescope, one could study their motion by looking at distant celestial bodies
 galileo ne iskaa vivaran sunakar swayan aisi doorabeen kaa nirmaan kar daalaa jo holland main avishkrut doorabeen se kahin adhik shaktishaalee thi
 Based on this, through his observations and experiments, Galileo found that all the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, contrary to the prevailing beliefs in the universe
 isse purv copernicus ne bhi yah kaha tha ki prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he jiske liye unhe carch kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa tha
 Now, based on the results based on experimentation and discretion, Galilea found it to be the same
 us samay tak yah sarvamaanya sidwant tha ki brahmand ke kendra main prithvi sthit he tathaa surya or chandramaa sahit sabhi akashiya pind lagaataar prithvi kii parikrama karte he
 This recognition was supported by the religious leaders of Tadsamay
 apane prayogon ke aadhaar par praapt parinaamon ke kaaran galileo ne puraani avadharanaon ke virudv khadey hone kaa nirnay liya
 When Galileo made this doctrine public, the Church considered it his disobedience and for this disobedience Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment on behalf of the Church
 galileo ke dwaara diye gayi vichaar ne tadsamay manushya ke chintan kii disha ke naye rup main swikaarne ko vivash kar diya
 Due to social and religious persecution, he could not stand for long with the theories, contrary to the prevailing beliefs and beliefs
 varsh 1633 main 69 varshiya vrudv galileo ko carch kii ore se yah aadesh diya gaya ki ve saarvajanik taur par maafee maangate huye yah kahen ki dharmik manyataon ke virudv diye gayi unke sidwant unke jivan kii sabase bady bhul thi jiske liye ve sharminda hai
 He did the same, but even after this he was imprisoned
 unka swasthya lagaataar bigadta rahaa or isi ke chalate karawas kii sajaa grih-kaid arthath apane hi ghar main kaid main rahane kii sajaa main badal diya gaya
 He also spent the last day of his life in this prison
 hameshaa se pope kii nigaraanee main rahane vaali vatican city sthit isaai dharm kii sarvacch sanstha ne 1992 main yah sweekaar kiya kiya ki galileo ke maamle main nirnay lene main unase galati huyi thi
 Thus, it took more than three and a half years for the Church to accept its historical error by ordering a 1633 order regarding Galileo, a great astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher
 varsh 1609 main doorabeen ke nirmaan or khagoleey pindon ke prekshan kii ghatana ke chaar sau saalon ke baad 400veen jayanti ke rup main varsh 2009 ko antarrashtriya khagoliki varsh ke rup main manaakar is mahaan vaigyanik ko shradwanjali arpit kar apni bhul kaa praashchitya karne kaa prayaas kiya

 He was very interested in politics

 It contains a biography of a man who arrives on an unknown island alone after a ship breaks down, builds his own hut with the help of some tools
 friday naamak sevak ekmaatr uskaa mitra he
 Defoe has presented an authentic, detailed description of how he gets amazing experiences there
 yah upanyaas chhapate hi khub bika or ab to vishwasahitya main vah ek he
 All the events and descriptions of the book are such lively and such a poignant description of human nature is made in smooth fluency language that the huge community of newly educated literate readers of that time accepted the whole story as true

 sahityagunon main vishisht yaa bahut unchi na hone par bhi uski rachanaayen atyadhik lokapriy baniin
 One reason for this was that he took his characters and events from the real-life background of direct life and mixed the necessary amount of imagination into them

 Aesthetics is the study of sensory-emotional qualities — religion and values
 kala, samskruti or prakruti kaa pratankan hi saundaryashastra he
 Aesthetics is a part of philosophy
 ise soundaryamimasaa tatha anandamimasaa bhi kehete hai
 Beauty is the scripture in which there is an elemental, philosophical and poignant interpretation of the beauty that is expressed or contained in artistic works, creations etc
 kisi sundar vastu ko dekhakar hamaare man main jo anandadaayini anubhuti hoti he uske swabhaav or swaroop kaa vivechan tathaa jivan kii anyaanya anubhutiyon ke saath uskaa samanvay sthapit karnaa inkaa mukhya uddeshy hota he
 Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy under which questions related to art, literature and beauty are discussed
 gyaan ke daayre se bhinn indriya-bodh dwaara praapt hone vaale taatparyon ke liye unani bhashaa main 'astetiko' shabd he jisase 'esthetics' kii vyutpatti hui
 a classical aesthetical approach related to nature, art, and literature developed
 yah nazariyaa keval kriti kii sundarata or kala-rup se hi apana sarokaar rakhte hue uske raajnneetik or sandarbhagat ayaamon ko vimarsh ke daayre se baahar rakhata he
 But there are also some methods of brainstorming art and literature that communicate the meaning of works and social and historical aspects of their creation process
 marxvaadi saundaryashastra ek aisa hi vimarsh he
 Plato's work in ancient Greek philosophy discusses the concept of beauty in Hippias Major
 naatak kii dukhaant style par arestu dwaara apni rachana poitics main kiye gayi vichaar ne kala-aalochana ko lambe arase tak prabhavit kiya he
 In the context of non-western ancient thinking on art and beauty, the Natyashastra of India, Abhinavagupta's rasa-siddhanta and the creation of Chinese scholar Cheng Yin-yuwan, Li-tai ming-hua Chi's unique and elaborate discussions presented in the Western world as well is believed
 kala-anushilan kii is parampara kii vyakhya karne ke gair-pashchimi maanak abhi tak nahin ban paye hai or pashchimi maanakon ke zariye kii gayi vyakhyaaon ke nattejey asantoshjanak nikle hai
 a separate concept of aesthetics emerged as a philosophical activity in Western thought in the eighteenth century when art works began to be isolated from handcrafts
 iskaa nateeja siddhantkaron dwaara lalit kala kii avadharana ke sutrikaran main niklaa
 Alexander Gottlieb Bomgarthen wrote an esthetica in 1750 to initiate a debate
 iske saat saal baad david hum dwaara ‘of da standard of test’ likh kar saundaryashastra ke ubharate hue vimarsh ko prashnaankit kiya gaya
 But the real beginning of modern European aesthetic aesthetics began with Emmanuel Kant's work published in 1790, Critique of Judgment
 apni is kriti main kaant ne saundaryashastreey akalan kii kasautiyon ko saarvbhaum banane par jor diya
 But on the other hand, he appeared to be skeptical of the possibility of any kind of universal aesthetics
 is virodhabhas ke baavjood kaant kii uplabdhi yah rahi ki unhone kala or saundarya kii vivechna ke liye kuch anivaary dvibhajanon ko sthapit kar diya
 The most notable of these dialects are: sense perception and logic, essence and form, expression and expression, pleasure and epiphany, freedom and necessity, etc
 kaant kii duusari uplabdhi yah thi ki unhone saundaryashastreey anubhav or andrik anubhav ke bich antar sthapit kiya
 He said that aesthetics should be interpreted and concluded without any practical attachment to the goal of analysis
 unnisvin sadi ke bare main kaha ja saktaa he ki vah saundaryashastra kii shatabdi thi
 It was only on Kant's land that German scholars later created a larger philosophical framework of aesthetics
 higel ne apni rachana lectures on esthetics main, shoppenhor ne da world ez vil and ripragentation main or nitshe ne berth of tragedy main pashchimi saundaryashastra ke vibhinn pahaluon kii baarik vyakhyaayein kin or uske naye ayaamon ko prakashit kiya
 Formalism emerged in English-speaking aesthetics in the late nineteenth century
 victoriayan britain ne ‘kala kala ke liye’ kaa naaraa diya jiske pravaktaaon main auskar wild kaa naam ullekhneey he
 The stylistic approach emphasizing purely aesthetic experience deeply influenced modern art forms in almost all fields
 lekin is andolan ke virodh kii dhvaniyaan mahaan roosi sahityakar liyo tolstoy kii rachana whot iz art? or america parinamwad ke pramukh pravaktaa jon divi kii kriti art ez experience main sunaayi deen
 Tolstoy argued that art that cannot communicate moral sensations among humans, however great it may be in terms of metaphorical criteria, cannot be appreciated
 divi ne bhi sampreshan kii bhoomika ke sawaal par rupvaad se loha lete hue kala ko saundaryashastra ke naam par uske daayre ke baahar maujuud anubhav kii sanrachanaon se kaat kar rakhane kaa virodh kiya
 The German tradition of aesthetic thinking continued into the twentieth century as well
 ghatnakriyashastra, vyakhyashastra or marxvad ke auzaaron kaa istemaal karke saundaryashastra sambandhi siddhanton ko or samrudh kiya gaya
 In 1936 Martin Heidegger wrote an essay like 'the Origin of the Work of Art' which is considered one of the best works of philosophy of art
 haidagar ne is niabandh main daawa kiya ki kala-kriti ko is jagat main sthit vastu ke rup main dekhnaa aadhuniktaa kii moolbhoot lakshanik trutiyon main se ek he
 According to Heidegger, art opens the doors of a new world, truth not only decreases in the form of art, it also inaugurates the existence of things in the realm of our own experience
 is tarah saundaryashastra ke madhyam se haidagar ne aadhuniktaa kii aalochana karte hue vastuon kii parmparik astitv-mimasaa or praudyogikeey vyakhya ko aade haathon liya
 By the mid-twentieth century, the utility of aesthetics began to be questioned
 sadi kii shuruyaat main diye gayi apane kuch vyakhyanon main edward bulo yah prashn puch chuke the ki kahin kala or saundarya kii paribhaashaayen kalakaar kii srijan- kshamta kaa kshay to nahin kar rahi hai
 These lectures were published in 1957 and in the sixties American artist Barnett Newman declared that the use of aesthetics is the same for art as that of ornithology for birds
 arthath saundaryashastra se anbhigya kalakaar hi acha he
 Under the study of culture, the oriented trends of aesthetics have been rigorously tested
 pier bordiyo ne samskruti ke samajashaastra ke tahat kala ke vichaardhaaratmak aadhaar kii na keval shinaakht kii balki yah bhi kaha ki isi kaaran se saundayshaastra apni hi saanskrithik or raajnneetik jadon kaa sandhan nahin kar paaya he
 Bordeaux's counterpoint to this idea is found in Adorno's work Aesthetic Theory
 adorno beesvin sadi kii avangaard kala kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki kala main abhi bhi vichaardhaara kaa pratwaad karne kii kshamta he
 According to Adorno, art is a product of its society, but its creation process also contains an autonomous moment from social determinism
 isliye vah kalakaar or uske darshak yaa pathak ko tatkaaleen prabhutvshaalee samskruti dwaara thamaye gayi taur- tareekon se itar sochane kaa mauka bhi detii he
 Some Marxist scholars have also tried to develop a Marxist category of aesthetics
 hindi ke pramukh marxvaadi saahityalochak namvar singh ne is tarah kii koshishon ko aalochanatmak drushti se dekhte hue iskaa pehla udhaaharan soviet sangh main ‘samaajawaadee yatharthwaad’ kaa shaastra-nirmaan mana he
 He has said, 'with the formation of scripture, social reality was also formulated and the style of expressing that reality too
 dekhte-dekhte ek nayaa ritivaad chal padaa, rachana main bhi, aalochana main bhi
 The country which had a socialist revolution, did not hesitate to make any revolution in the field of literature and art
 yatharth kaa aisa or itnaa apmaan to kranti ke pehle ke sahitya main bhi nahin hua tha or unnisvin sadi ke europe ke sahitya main bhi nahin jab burjwa kranti ne yatharthwaad ko janm diya tha
 The condition became very much like that of the literature-trend called Hindi rituals, when poems were being written keeping the characteristic texts of the rhetoric
 ’ Namvar Singh gives another example of a large treatise called Aesthetics by George Lukach
 ve ise lukach dwaara apane lagbhag saath varshon ke deergh sahitya-chintan ko antat ek vyavasthit shaastra main baandhane kaa viraat prayaas qaraar dete hai, ‘hazaron prishthon kaa yah vishaal granth abhi tak german bhashaa main hi uplabdh he or jo german acchhee tarah jaanate honge, vahi iske bare main kuch vishwaspurvak kah sakane main sakasham honge
 On the basis of what has been said about him so far in English and the impression he has received from his sporadic excerpts, it can be said that it has failed to try all the arts in 'imitation'
 is prakaar marxvaadi lukach jab sabhi kalaon ko ek shaastra main baandhane chalate hai to antat arestu kii sharan jane ko baadhya hote hai
 An English weekly reviewing this treatise had published a cartoon in which Aristotle's appearance and appearance with Lukach Marx's beard
 ’ namvar singh kii manyata he ki lukach ke drushtaant se marxvaadi saundaryashastra kii is lambi parampara kaa ek kamazor pahalu saamne aata he
 He says that 'often he himself failed to challenge an institution called' Kala 'and saw no harm in accepting the classical definition of art
 buniyadi rup main ek baar in paribhaashaon ko sweekaar kar lene ke baad to phir thode- bahut her-pher ke saath is-us kavi yaa kriti ke moolyankan kaa kaary hi shesh rahata he; or kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki marxvaadi saundaryashastriyon ne is kshetra main apni pratibha kaa johar bakhubi dikhaaya he— unchi samskruti ke bade-se- bade vichaarkon se hode lete hue
 The language of interpretation and evaluation is certainly materialistic as well as historical, but overall it is not very different from the dominant tradition

 According to Aryabhata, the Mahabharata war took place in 3137 BCE
 kaliyug kaa armbh krishna ke is yuddh ke 35 varsh pashchaat nidhan par hua
 According to Encyclopedia of Hinduism, the Kali Yuga started from 3102 BCE immediately after Lord Krishna's departure from this earth
 dharmraj yudhisthir, bhimsen, arjuna, nakul or sahadev paanchon pandav mahaparakramee parakshit ko rajya dekar mahaprayan hetu uttarakhand kii ore chale gayi or vahaan jaakar punyalok ko praapt huye
 The king began to rule according to Parikshit Dharma and according to the Brahmins
 uttar naresh kii putree iravati ke saath unhone apana vivaah kiya or us uttam patni se unke chaar putr utpann huye
 By making Acharya Krupa a Guru, he performed three Ashwamedha Yagyas on the banks of Jahnavi
 un yagyon main anant dhan raashi brahmanon ko daan main di or digvijay hetu nikal gayi
 At the same time, Dharma made the form of a bull and met Gaurupini Earth on the Saraswati coast
 gaurupini prithvi kii netron se ashru bah rahe the or vah shrihin si prathit ho rahi thi
 Religion asked the Earth - "oh God! Why are you being mistaken? What are you worried about? Are you worrying about me, now that i am left with only one foot or you are talking about this?" Worried that now the Shudra will rule over you? " prithvi boli - "he dharm! tum sarvajna hokar bhi mujh se mere dukh kaa kaaran poochhate ho! satya, pavitrataa, kshamaa, dayaa, santosh, tyaag, sham, dam, tap, saralata, kshamta, shaastra vichaar, uparati, titiksha, gyaan, vairaygy, shaury, tej, aishwarya, bal, smriti, kaanti, kaushal, swatantrata, nirbhikta, komalta, dhairya, saahas, sheel, vinay, saubhaahgya, utsaah, gambheertha, kirti, aastikta, sthirataa, gaurav, ahankaarhinta aadi gunon se yukt bhagwaan shrikrishna ke swadham gaman ke kaaran ghor kaliyug mere upar aa gaya he

 bhagwaan shrikrishna ke jin charnon kii seva lakshmi ji karti hai unamem camel, vajra, ankush, dhwaja aadi ke chihn virajman hai or ve hi charan mujh par padate the jisase main saubhagyawati thi
 Now my good luck has ended
 " While Dharma and Prithvi were talking about this, Kali Yuga came there as a crowned Shudra and started killing them both
 raja parakshit digvijay karte huye vahiin par se guzar rahe the
 They saw the crowned Shudra with a stick in his hand, beating a cow and a bull badly
 vah bail atyant sundar tha, uskaa shwet rang tha or keval ek pair tha
 The cow was also beautiful like Kamadhenu
 donon hi bhaybheet ho kar kaanp rahe the
 Maharaj Parikshit offered his bow and bowed in a solemn voice like a cloud - "O wicked! Sinner! Naradham! Who are you? Why are you torturing these innocent cows and bulls? You are a great criminal
" tere aparaadh kaa uchit dand tera vadh hi he
 "on hearing these words, Kali Yuga shivered with fear
 maharaj ne bail se poocha ki he bail tumhaare teen pair cas toote gayi hai
 You are a bull or a god
 he dhenuputr! tum nirbhiktapurvak apana apana vrutant mujhe bataao
 Hey Gaumata! Now you are free from fear
 main dushton ko dand detaa hoon
 Which evil has committed this stigma in the holy fame of the Pandavas by committing gross sins in my kingdom? Even if he is a sinful true God, i will cut off his hands too
 tab dharm bolaa - "he maharaj! aapane bhagwaan shrikrishna ke parambhakt pandavon ke kul main janm liya he atah ye vachan aap hi ke yogya hai
 Hey Rajan! We do not know who afflicts the creatures of the world
 shastron main bhi iskaa nirupan anek prakaar se kiya gaya he
 He who does not believe in duality accepts the cause of sorrow for himself
 koi praarabdh ko hi dukh kaa kaaran maanata he or koi karm ko hi dukh kaa nimitt samajhataa he
 Certain scholars consider nature and certain Gods to be the cause of sorrow
 atah he rajan! ab aap hi nishchit kijiye ki dukh kaa kaaran koun he
 " samraat parakshit us bail ke vachanon ko sun kar bole - "he vrishabh! aap avashya hi bail ke rup main dharm hai or yah gaurupini prithvi mata he
 You know the heart of religion very well
 aap kisi kii chugali nahin kar sakate isiliye aap dukh dene vaale kaa naam nahin bataa rahe hai
 o religion! Your tenacity, purity, mercy and truth were the four stages in the Satyuga
 treta main teen charan rah gayi, dwapar main do hi rah gayi or ab is dusht kaliyug ke kaaran aapkaa ek hi charan rah gaya he
 This unrighteous Kali Yuga is trying to destroy even that phase by its untruth
 bhagwaan shrikrishnachandra ke swadham gaman se dusht paapi shudra raja log is gaurupini prithvi ko bhogenge isi kaaran se yah mata bhi duhkhi hai
 " itnaa kah kar raja parikshith ne us paapi shudra rajveshadhari kaliyug ko maarane ke liye apni tikshn dhar vaali talwaar nikaali
 Kaliyug, fearful, took off his majestic dress and fell at the feet of King Parikshit and started saying tari-tahi
 raja parakshit bade sharnaagat vatsal the, unhone sharan main aaye huye kaliyug ko maarna uchit na samajha or kaliyug se kaha - "he kaliyug! tu mere sharan main aa gaya he isaliye maine tuje pranadan diya
 But only you are the root cause of wrongdoing, sin, lies, theft, treachery, poverty etc
 atah tu mere rajya se turant nikal ja or laut kar phir kabhi mat aana
 " raja parakshit ke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug ne kaatar vaani main kaha - "he rajan! aapkaa rajya to sampoorn prithvi par he, aapke rajya se baahar aisa koi bhi sthaan nahin he jahaan par ki main nivas kar sakun
 Hey Bhupathi! You are very kind, you have given me shelter
 ab dayaa karke mere nivas kaa bhi kuch na kuch prabandh aapako karnaa hi hoga
 " kaliyug is tarah kehane par raja parakshit soch main pad gayi
 After considering it, he said - "O Kali Yuga! Gaming, drinking, adultery and violence are inhabited by untruth, item, work and anger in these four places
 in chaar sthanon main nivas karne kii main tuje chhot detaa hoon
 "kali Yuga said this -" o Uttaranandan! These four places are insufficient for my residence
 dayaa karke koi or bhi sthaan mujhe dijiye
 "on asking for this kind of Kali Yuga, King Parikshit gave him the fifth place 'swarna'
 kaliyug in sthanon ke mil jane se pratyakshtah to vahaan se chalaa gaya kintu kuch dur jane ke baad adrushya rup main waapas aakar raja parakshit ke swarna mukut main nivas karne laga
 After this, he wandered a lot for the hunted prey and had a bad condition due to hunger and thirst
 shaam ke samay thake haare vah shamik rishi ke ashram pahunche rishi us samay brahamalin samaaghi main leen the 
 
 parikshit ne kaha ki hamen pyaas lagi he hamen pani chahie yahaan or koi bhi nahi he kya aap sun rahe he ham raja parikshit bol rahe he hamen pyaas lagi he hamen pani chahie aapako sunai nahi detaa kya rishi us samay samaaghi main brahamalin the raja ne do-teen baar pani maanga parantu rishi kii samaaghi nahi tuuti 
 
 rajmukut main baithe kalyug kii prarena se unki satvik buddhi bhrasht ho gai or unhone rishi ko dand dene kaa faisla kiya 
 But due to the good cremations of the king, he restrained himself from that sin
 krodh vash unhone mara hua saanp rishi ke gale main daal diya 
 The son of that Shamik Rishi, Shringiu was very strong and was bathing in the river at that time
 duusare rishi kumaro ne jaakar sara vritakan sunaaya 
 Hearing how a king has disowned his father, he became mad with anger and by filling the same river of river Shran with an anjuni, he cursed the king, the arrogant and foolish king who insulted my great father the same

 a fractional number used in fluid dynamics and temperature variation
 The Weber number is a dimensionless number in fluid mechanics that is often useful in analysing fluid flows where there is an interface between two different fluids, especially for multiphase flows with strongly curved surfaces
 It can be thought of as a measure of the relative importance of the fluid's inertia compared to its surface tension
 The quantity is useful in analyzing thin film flows and the formation of droplets and bubbles
 It is named after Moritz Weber and may be written as: where The modified weber number, w e ∗ = w e 48 { \ displaystyle We^{*}={ \ frac {we}{48}}} equals the ratio of the kinetic energy on impact to the surface energy, where and saanchaa:nondimflumech We = rho * u ^ 2 * d / Sigma pipal bharat, nepal, shri lanka, china or indonesia main paaya jane vaala bargad, yaa gooler kii jati kaa ek vishalkay vriksh he jise bhartiya samskruti main mahatvapurn sthaan diya gaya he tathaa anek parvon par isaki puja kii jaati he

 quark se milakar banane vaale avyav hedron {hadrons} kehalaate he
 Baryons {baryons} are formed from a combination of three quarks, anti-beryons by combining three anti-quarks, and mesons by combining one quark and one anti-quark
 do ap quark evam ek down quark ke sangyojan se proton tathaa ek ap quark evam do down quark ke sangyojan se neutron banate he
 Baryan, mesan, proton, neutron, nucleon {a proton + a neutron} and an atomic nucleus are all called hadrons because they all consist of quarks
 quark kaa sankhyikeey vyavhaar fermion hota he
 Quarks have a variety of properties, such as electric charge, color charge, geometry or spin {spin} and mass
 pratikan main bhi yah sabhi gun paye jate he, parantu vipareet hote he
 The electric charge of the up-type quark is +2 / 3 and that of the down-type quark is -1 / 3
 inke pratikan kaa aavesh vipareet kramash: -2 / 3 or +1 / 3 hota he
 The electric charge of particles formed by combining quarks is equal to the sum of the total electric charges of quarks found in it
 jaise:- proton kaa vidyut aavesh, do ap-quark or ek down-quark ke vidyut aavesho ke kul yoga ke baraabar arthath 1 hota he
 Similarly, the electric charge of a neutron is zero
 mukhya lekh : durbal antahkriya One of the four fundamental interactions of particle physics, only through weak interactions can a quark of one flavor be transformed into a quark of another flavor
 ek w boson ko avashoshit yaa utsarjit karke kisi bhi ap-prakaar quark ko kisi bhi down-prakaar quark main parivartit kar sakate hai tathaa isi tarah thik iske vipareet
 This flavor change mechanism causes a radioactive process of beta decay, in which a neutron is "split" into a proton, an electron, and an electron antinutrino
 yah tab hota he jab kisi neutron main koi ek down quark kaa abhaasi W− boson utsarjak dwaara ap quark main kshay ho jaataa he or neutron ko ek proton main badal detaa he
 The W− boson then breaks into one electron and one electron antinutrino
 kwantum chromodynamiks ke anusaar, quark janmajaat rang aavesh naamak gundharm rakhte he
 There are three types of color charge - green, red, and blue
 isi tarah teen prati rang aavesh hote he-megenta, syaan or pilaa
 Each quark carries one color, while each antiquark carries one color
 rang aavesh keval quark or gluon main hote he
 Keep in mind, color charge has no relation to the color spectrum of visible light
 teen rangon ke bhinn-bhinn sanyojanon ke saath quarkon ke aaveshon ke madhya aakarshan or pratikarshan kii pranali prabal antahkriya kehalaati he, jisaki madhyasthata gluon naamak bal vaahak kan dwaara hoti he; isaki neeche main vistaar se charchaa hui he
 The theory that explains strong interactions is called quantum chromodynamics
 a quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor
 The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an antiquark with color charge −ξ will result in a color charge of 0 and the formation of a meson
 This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics
 Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same "white" color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon
 The quark has a fault or spin of 1 / 2

 Edema of angioedema or quinke is a disease in which there is rapid swelling of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues
 yah bahut kuch pitti se miltaa-julata hota he, parantu pitti ko aamtaur par hikes ke naam se janaa jaataa he, yah upari charm ko prabhavit karata he
 The term angioedema for this condition was used based on the concept that it also affects the nervous system, but is now believed to have no effect on the nervous system
 jin maamalon main vahikashof bahut teji se badhata he, uskaa upachaar apatkaaleen chikitsa ke rup main kiya janaa chahie kyonki aise maamalon main vayumarg main baadha utpann ho sakati he or rogi kaa dam ghut saktaa he
 Epinephrine can be life-saving when the cause of angioedema is allergic
 vanshanugat vahikashof ke maamle main, epinephrine upachaar main adhik madadgaar sabit nahin hoti he
 It has been found that it can also be caused by side effects of drugs other than allergies, especially in the effects of Asei inhibitors
 iske atirikt, iske teen autosomal prabhavi vanshanugat rup hai, aisa jin main utparivartan ke kaaran ho saktaa he jisase thakka tut jaataa he, isamen sarping i jin shaamil he, jisamen utparivartan ke parinamswaroop rakt protein si ai sandamak main kami aa jaati he or F12 jin jo karak XII ko niyantrit karata he
 There is another type in which c i levels are normal but the working level of CI decreases
 These three forms are called hereditary angioedema, or sometimes an older term, "hereditary nerve vessel edema"
 echai ke sabhi roopon main pachan naal or anya angon main bhi sujan aa sakati he
 If this swelling reaches the respiratory tract, it can also be fatal due to asphyxia
 chehre kii twachaa, saamanyatya munh ke aas paas kii twachaa or munh kii mucosa or gale kii mucosa or jeebh main kuch minuton yaa kuch ghanton ke andar hi sujan aa jaati he
 Sometimes, other parts of the body, especially the hands, may also swell
 isamen khujali or dard ho saktaa he
 There may be a decrease in sensation due to contraction of nerves in the affected areas
 saath hi pitti kaa bhi vikaas ho saktaa he
 In severe cases, airway contractions may occur, breath sounds begin to occur
 oxigen kaa str kam ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, there is a need to open the respiratory tract to prevent respiratory obstruction and eliminate the risk of death
 kabhi kabhi, rogi haal hi main kisi alrjan ke sampark main aayaa hota he, lekin aksar iskaa karak agyaat hota he yaa kabhi kabhi hi ise kisi alrjan se joda jaataa he
 In hereditary angioedema, there is often no direct cause, although mild trauma, such as dental treatment, or any other stimulation may be the cause
 isamen aamtaur par pitti yaa khujali aadi nahin hoti, kyonki yah kisi prakaar kii allergy kii pratikriya nahin hoti he
 In patients with HAE, frequent abdominal pain conditions may occur, usually accompanied by excessive vomiting, weakness, and in some cases, thin diarrhea, like itchy scratches, etc
 pet main yah samasya ausatan ek se paanch dinon main ho sakati he, is dauraan aakraamak dard prabandhan or hydration ke liye aspataal main bhartee hone kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Due to these stomach problems, the number of white blood cells of the patient increases greatly, it reaches around 13-30,000
 jaisi jaise lakshan gaayab hone lagate hai, shwet rakt kanikaon kii sankhya kam hone lagati he or is aghat ke khatm hone tak saamaanya ho jaati he
 Its symptoms and clinical trials are difficult to distinguish from acute abdomen, in which case many unnecessary tests are done by patients with HAE such as laparotomy and laparoscopy
 HEA can also cause inflammation in many other organs such as hands, feet, reproductive organs, neck, throat and face
 The pain in it sometimes causes discomfort and sometimes can be very extreme, depending on its condition and severity
 shof kaa aglaa hamalaa kahaan or kab hoga, iskaa pataa lagaana lagbhag asambhav hota he
 It is often seen once a month in most of the patients, but there are also patients who have it only once a week or only two or three times a year
 iske lakshanon main bhi kuch bhinnata ho sakati he, isamen sankraman, choti chot, jalan, tanaav aadi shaamil ho sakate hai
 In most cases, edema occurs in 12 to 36 hours and ends in 2 to 5 days
 nidaan ko naidanik tasviir ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Blood tests are routinely performed on a regular basis
 mast cell tripates kaa str bad saktaa he yadi aghat kisi gambhir allergy pratikriya ke kaaran hua ho

 HAE type III is a diagnosis of observed edema with a normal level of c i function
 vanshanugat rup ke bare main aksar lambe samay tak pataa nahin chalata he, kyonki iske lakshan kai anya rogon jaise allergy or antreey rog ke samaan hote hai
 An important point is that hereditary rhizophrenia also does not exhibit a response to antihistamines or steroids, a symptom that distinguishes it from common allergies
 jin rogiyon main vishesh rup se jathrantra maarg sambandhi lakshan hi utpann hote hai, unamem echai kaa nidaan bahut mushkil hota he
 In addition to family history of the disease, only laboratory analysis can confirm the final
 is vishleshan main, aksar C4 kaa str kam paaya jaataa he, jabaki C1-INH main utani kami nahin aati he
 The former is caused by a response to the complement system of the immune system, which is permanently reactive due to a decrease in regulation of C1-INH
 vanshanugat vahikashof ke sabhi roopon main breadikinin mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 This peptide is a potent vasodilator and increases vascular permeability, leading to rapid accumulation of fluid in the interstitium
 yah chehre main spasht rup se dekha jaataa he, jahaan twachaa main sahaayak yoji utak apekshaakrit kam hote hai
 And edema develops easily
 breadikinin kaa sravan kai prakaar kii koshikaon ke dwaara kai uttejkon kii pratikriya ke parinamswaroop hota he
 Bradykinin inhibition has been found to relieve HAE symptoms
 vibhinn pranaliyaan jo breadikinin ke utpaadan yaa sandman main baadha utpann karti hai, ve vahikshof utpann kar sakati hai
 acye inhibitors inhibit acye, an enzyme that inhibits bradykinin
 vanshanugat vahikshof main, breadikinin kaa nirmaan iske ek praathmik sandamak C1-esteres kii kami ke kaaran poorak pranali ke niratar sakriyan ke kaaran hota he
 Also, another reason is the continuous formation of calcrain, another process that is inhibited by C1INH
 yah cerin protiyes sandamak aamtaur par C1r or C1s ke C1q ke saath sambandh ko sandamit karata he or CI -jatil ke nirmaan ko avaruddh karata he, jo poorak pranali ke anya proteinon kaa sakriyan karata he
 Additionally, it inhibits different proteins that break down clots, although this deficiency has limited effects on the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis
 vanshanugat vahikashof ke teen prakaar hai: Low level of type i -C1INH; prakaar II - saamaanya str par C1INH ke kaary main kami ; No abnormality in type III - C1INH, it appears in an X-linked dominant pattern and therefore mainly affects women; It can have harmful effects on pregnancy and hormonal contraception
 yah kaarak XII jin main utparivartan se sambandhit he
 Angioedema can also occur due to the formation of antibodies against C1INH; It is a autoimmune abnormality
 arjeet vahikashof limphoma ke vikaas se sambandhit he
 Consuming food that serves to spread the vessel, such as alcohol and cinnamon, may increase the likelihood of angioedema in prospective patients
 agar aise bhojan ke upbhog ke baad aisi sthiti utpann hoti he, isamen kuch ghanton kii yaa raat bhar kii deree ho sakati he, jisase ise is padaarth ke upbhog se sambandhit karnaa kuch mushkil ho jaataa he
 Conversely, consuming bromelain with turmeric may be beneficial in reducing symptoms
 aspirin yaa ibuprophen ke upyog se kuch rogiyon main isaki sambhaavna bad sakati he
 Acetaminophen use may also sometimes increase its likelihood
 allergic vahikashof main alrjan kaa upyog naa karnaa or antithistemins kaa upyog karnaa iske bhavi khatre ko roak saktaa he
 Serizine is often recommended to such patients
 kuch rogiyon main paaya gaya he ki is dawa kaa raat main kam maatra main upbhog karne se isaki aavruti kam ho jaati he or jab kabhi aisi samasya utpann hoti he, tab isi dawa kii adhik khuraaq di jaati he
 In severe cases of angioedema, desensitization may be required to eliminate the risk of death
 Older cases require steroid therapy, which usually leads to good response
 dawa se utp sandamak vahikashof ko utpann kar sakate hai
 acye inhibitory enzymes block Asei, so that it cannot further reduce bradykinin levels; In this way, bradykinin accumulates and causes angioedema
 yah jatilta africa americanyon main adhik dekhi jaati he
 In people with Acy inhibitory angioedema, drug consumption has to be stopped and an alternative treatment is used, such as ARB
 Its action system is similar, but it does not affect bradykinin
 haalanki, yah vivadaspad he
 Some small studies have shown that ARB may develop in patients with ACE inhibitor angioedema
 vanshanugat vahikashof main vishesh uttejk jinke kaaran rog kii sthiti utpann hoti he, unke upyog ko band kar dena chahie
 yah antithistemins, carticosteroids, yaa epinephrine ke prati pratikriya pradarshit nahin karata he
 In its treatment, C1-INH concentrated with donor's blood is used, which is inserted into the vessels
 ek apaat sthiti main, taaja jame hue rakt plasma, jisamen C1-INH shaamil ho, kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 However, in most European countries, concentrated C1-INH is used in patients who participate in specialized programs
 taaja jame hue plasma kaa upyog vaikalpik rup se sandrit C1-INH ke sthaan par kiya ja saktaa he
 In acquired angioedema, HAE types i and II and non-histamineergic angioedema, antifibrinolytic such as tranexmic acid or ε-amino caproic acid may be effective
 sinarizine bhi upyogi ho saktaa he kyonki, yah C4 ke sakriyan ko avaruddh karata he or iskaa upyog yakrut rogiyon main kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki androgen yah kaam nahin kar saktaa
