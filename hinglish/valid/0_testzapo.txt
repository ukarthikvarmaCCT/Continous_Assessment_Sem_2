 Often these two levels are represented as "low" and "high"

 In an analog system, noise from old and discarded information is stored
 ek digital pranali main jab tak kul shorgul ek nishchit str se neeche he, jaankaree ko puri tarah se punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to do similar work and thus heat is generated
 portable yaa bydaree chaalit pranaaliyon main yah digital pranali ke upyog ko simit kar sakati he
 Battery-powered cellular telephones, for example, often use a low-power analog forearm to amplify and establish radio signals from the base station

 Digital circuits are sometimes very expensive, especially in small quantities
 sanvedya jagat enlog ke hai or is jagat se sanket enlog matraaen hai
 For example light, temperature, sound, electrical conductivity, electrical and magnetic bases are analogs
 sabase upyogi digital system nirantar analog sanketon se digital sanketon ko alag karne ke liye badalanaa hoga
 This causes quantization errors
 agar system vaanchit degree kii vishwastata ke pratinidhitiv karne ke liye paryaapt digital data kaa bhandaaran karata he to parimanikaran truti ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem provides an important directive of how much digital data is required to accurately represent a defined analog signal

 Because of the clef effect, it is difficult for users to tell if a specific system was right on the verge of failure or whether it can tolerate too much noise before it fails
 digital bhangshiltaa ko ek digital pranali ke roopankan dwaara majbootee ke liye kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a parity bit or other error handling method can be inserted into the signal path
 yah paddati system ko, truti kaa pataa lagane main madad karti he or yaa to trutiyon ko sahi karti he yaa phir kam se kam data kii ek nai pratilipi ke liye puuchhati he

 This helps protect against failures that can cause the microcontroller instruction to spoil the indicator, which might otherwise lead to the execution of random code
 digital smriti or sanchaaran pranali truti kaa pataa lagane or sudhaar jaise takneekon kaa istemaal sanchaaran or storage main kisi bhi truti ke sudhaar ke liye atirikt data kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 On the other hand in digital systems some techniques are used to make those systems' single bit errors more vulnerable

 Digital circuits are composed of analog components

 digital system ko shorgul or samay margin, paraseete anugam or capcitance or filter bijli conection kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 Poor design leads to intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishing fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "runt pulses" not reaching valid threshold voltages or a combination of unexpected logic states
 jab se digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai digital circuit lo-prisishan se bhi dhire gananaa karata he jo ek samaan spes or shakti kaa prayog karata he
 However the digital circuit will be able to assess repeatedly due to its high noise immunity
 On the other hand, analog circuits in high precision domains need more power and digital equivalent area
 ek digital circuit kaa nirmaan aksar logic gates kahe jane vaale chote se electronic circuit se kiya jaataa he
 Each logic gate represents the processes of Boolean logic
 logic get vidyut niyantrit switch kii ek vyavastha hoti he
 The output of a logic gate is an electric current or voltage that can control and bend most logic gates

 Integrated circuits are the least important method of making large amounts of logic gates

 Another form of digital circuit consists of lookup tables
 lukup talika, mashiinon par aadhaarit logic geton kii tarah hi kaary kar sakati hai lekin aasaani se taron ko badale bina hi riprogram kar sakati hai
 This means that designers can often repair design errors without changing the wiring arrangement

 Representations are important for the design of an engineer's digital circuit
 kuch vishleshan vidhiyaan keval vishesh pratinidhitiv ke saath kaam karti hai
 Representation of digital circuits with an equivalent set of logic gates is a classical method
 praayah kam se kam electronic ke saath electronic swichon ke samakaksh pranali kaa nirmaan ek doosraa tarika he 
 One of the easiest ways is to have a memory with only one table
 memory ke pate par input daale jate hai or memory ke data autput, autput ban jate hai
 These reports have digital file formats for automatic analysis that can be processed by computer programs
 adhikansh digital ejeeniyar anukool fil swaroop ke saath computer program ke chayan main saavdhaanee baratate hai
 Engineers consider the types of digital systems for reporting
 adhikansh digital system "sangyojan system" or "anukramik system" main vibhajit ho jate hai
 The input that is given in a combination system always gives the same output
 yah mul rup se logic prakriya ke set kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or jisaki charchaa pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 a sequential system is a combinatorial system with outputs inserted as inputs
 isse digital mashin opershan kaa kram se sanchaalan karata he
 The simplest sequential system is probably a flip flop, a mechanism that represents a binary digit or "bit"
 anukramik pranali ko aksar state mashin ke rup main dizin kiya jaataa he
 In this way engineers can design the aggregate behavior of a system and even test it in continuous simulation without considering the details of the logic processes without considering all the details of the logic functions
 anukramik system iske atirikt do upashreniyon main vibhajit hota he
 When a "clock" signal changes the state, the "synchronous" sequential system changes the state at once
 jab bhi input badalte hai "atulykaalik" anukramik pranali parivartan ko prasaarit karata he
 Synchronous sequential systems are characterized by asynchronous circuits such as flip flops, which make these changes only when the clock changes and in which the timing margin is carefully designed
 hameshaa kii tarah ek tulykaalik anukramik state mashin ko ek sangyojan logic main vibhajit karke lagu karne kaa vyaavhaarik tarika hota he or flip flop ke set ko "state register" kaha jaataa he
 Each time a clock gives a ticking signal and the state register captures the response generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and re-inserts it as the invariant input to the combinational part of the state machine
 sangyojan logic main samay ke khapat vaale adhikansh logic akalan dwaara ghadi kii sabase tej dar set hoti he
 The state register represents just one binary number
 agar state mashin main state bahut zyada hai to logic prakriya kuch sangyojan logic hote hai jo kai sankhya main state kaa utpaadan karti hai
 In comparison, the design of asynchronous systems is very difficult because the possible state must be considered at all possible times
 nunatam or adhiktam samay ke teble ke nirmaan ke sabase saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar isamen saare state vidyaman ho or vaise state ke minimise ke liye circuit ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or jo iske sabhi hisson ke susangat state main samay-samay par jane ke liye circuit ko baadhya kare

 Some circuits are inherently asynchronous in their design and should be analyzed as such

 Constructing an asynchronous circuit using fast parts indirectly "runs" the circuit faster

 Often they are designed using synchronous register transfer logic and have been used as VHDL or Verilog hardware description languages

 The output of each register is a bundle of wires called a "bus" that passes that number for other estimation

 Each estimation has a bus output and can be connected to multiple input registers
 kabhi-kabhi ek register ke paas inke input par bahusanketak hota he jisase yah kai bason main se kisi ek se nambar ko store kar saktaa he
 Alternatively the output of several things can be connected via buffers which can turn off the output of all devices except one

 In the 1980s some researchers found that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs using first-in-first-out synchronization logic
 is yojana main digital mashin, ek data pravaah ke ek set ke rup main pahachaani jaati he
 At each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the output of that step is solid and gives a presented signal to "hold the data" to the stages in which the inputs to those stages are used

 The most general-purpose transfer-logic machine is a computer

 ek baar input data ko sahi maanane ke baad, khud dizine ko abhi bhi shuddhta ke liye satyapit kiya janaa chahie
 Some instrument flows confirm the design first by producing a design and then scanning the design to produce input data relevant to the instrument flow
 yadi scan kiya hua data, input data ke saath mail khaataa he, to upkaran pravaah ne shaayad koi trutiyaan pesh nahin kii

 The cost of a logic gate is significant

 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct

 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them

 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree
 kintu uski vyaktigat samasyaon main koi parivartan na hua
 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work
 kaant ne, visham paristhitiyon ke baavjood, 1766 i
 tak vishvavidhyalay kii avaitnaik rup se seva kii
 In 1758 AD, he prayed for the post of chief teacher of logic and philosophy, but he failed
 1766 i
 main use adhyaapan ke saath-saath sahaayak pustkaalay prabandhak bhi niyukt kiya gaya or ab use das pound vaarshik vetan milane laga
 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas
 san 1770 i
 main prakashit laathini sthapanaalekh –"sansar kii samaj or buddhi ke aakaar evam siddhant" se uskaa chintan vyavasthit rup main viksit hota dikhaai detaa he
 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers
 granthon ke prakaashan se bhi koi badi dhanrashi nahin praapt hoti thi
 Kant earned only 30 pounds from his "critique of Pure Reason"
 kintu, bhautik sukhon kii aakanksha na kar, 1796 i
 tak vah sakriy rup se sansar ke gyaanakosh kii abhivruddhi ke nimitt praytn karata rahaa
 Out of these 26 years, Adi spent 12 years writing only one book "review of Pure Wisdom"
 ukt granth 1781 i
 main prakashit hua tha
 It is considered the best philosophical treatise in Kant's adult texts
 is kaal ke anya granth "prayek bhavi darshan kii bhoomika", "nitidarshan kii prishthbhumi", "prakritik vigyaan ke darshanik aadhaar", "vyaavhaarik buddhi kii samiksha", "nirnay kii samiksha", "keval buddhi dwaara simit dharm", tathaa "shaashvat shanti par" 
 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim
 He did not have the power to take care of his own house; He did not marry, but during the teaching period of 42 years, he made a good impression on his colleagues and students
 atev mitron evam shishyon se use apane jivan ke antim bhaag main kaaphi sahaayta evam sahanubhuti praapt hui
 After 1801 AD, he became very infirm, but in the last three years his disciple named Wesianski stayed together and cared for him
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is kaal ke likhe hue kaant ke saat granth uplabdh hai– "ethics", "naitik gun ke siddhant ke darshanik aadhaar", "the contradiction of the psyche powers, "vyaavhaarik drushti se nrishastra", "logic," Physical Geography "and" Pedagogy "
 itnaa kaary karne ke baad 12 farvari 1804 i
 ko konigsburg main uski mrityu hui
 Kant's personal life was gripped by adamant rules
 praat:kaal se sandhya tak uske sabhi kaam nishchit samay par hote the
 There were also rules for snack time
 paashchaatya darshanikon main se adhikansh bhramanshil rahe hai, kintu kaant apane nagar se jivan bhar main adhik se adhik saath mile gaya tha
 Yet his outlook was not narrow
 vah keval bauddhik chintak na tha, usne sucraat or pithagoras kii bhanti jivan main apane darshanik vichaaron ko sthaan diya tha
 a German poet named Hyne has spoken in praise of Kant's philosophical life that proves him eccentric, but his ideas have influenced the subsequent philosophy so much that Kant's scholar considers him the originator of a new era in philosophy

 Your devotees will be saved only by a mere heartfelt pronunciation of your name
 yadi ve tumhaari sachche man or prem-bhav se puja karenge to unki sabhi manokamana purna hogi or sabhi kaary safal honge
 The unique story of Shri Shyam Baba begins in the medieval Mahabharata
 ve pehle barbaric ke naam se jane jate the
 He is the son of Ghatotkacha, son of the very powerful Gadadhari Bhima and son of Nag Kanya Maurvi
 balykaal se hi ve bahut vir or mahaan yoddha the
 He learned martial arts from his mother and Shri Krishna
 bhagavan shiv kii ghor tapasya karke unhen prasann kiya or teen amogh baan praapt kiye; is prakaar teen bandhari ke naam se prasiddh naam praapt kiya
 Agnidev was pleased and offered him a bow, which was able to make him victorious in the three worlds
 mahabharat kaa yuddh kauravon or pandavon ke madhya aprihaary ho gaya tha, yah samachar barbaric ko praapt hue to unki bhi yuddh main sammilit hone kii ichha jaagrit hui
 When he reached to receive blessings from his mother, the mother pledged to support the loser
 ve apane nile rang ke ghode par savaar hokar teen baan or dhanush ke saath kurushetra kii ranbhumi kii ore chal pade
 The omnipresent Shri Krishna, wearing a Brahmin disguise, stopped him to learn about Barbarika and smiled at him knowing that he had come to join the war with just three arrows; Hearing this, Barbarik replied that only one arrow is enough to defeat the enemy army and after doing so, the arrow will return to Tunir
 yadi teenon baanon ko prayog main liya gaya to puure brahmand kaa vinaash ho jayega
 Knowing this, Lord Krishna challenged him to pierce and show all the leaves of this tree
 ve donon pipal ke vriksh ke neeche khadey the
 Barbarik accepted the challenge and took out an arrow from his coat and remembered God and drove the arrow towards the leaves of the tree
 baan ne kshambhar main ped ke sabhi patton ko vedh diya or shri krishna ke pair ke ird-gird chakkar lagane laga, kyonki ek patta unhone apane pair ke neeche chupa liya tha; barbaric ne kaha ki aap apane pair ko hataa lijie anyathaa ye baan aapke pair ko bhi vedh degaa
 Subsequently, Shri Krishna asked the child Barbarik from which side he would join the war; Barbaric reiterated the promise given to his mother and said that the side which was weak and losing in the war would support itself
 shri krishna jaanate the ki yuddh main haar to kauravon kii nishchit he or is kaaran agar barbaric ne unka saath diya to parinaam galat paksh main chalaa jayega
 Therefore, Shri Krishna, a Brahmin, expressed his desire for donations from Veer Barbarik
 barbaric ne unhen vachan diya or daan maangane ko kaha
 The Brahmin asked for the donation of Shisha
 vir barbaric kshan bhar ke liye achambhit hue, parantu apane vachan se adig nahin ho sakate the
 Veer Barbarik said that an ordinary Brahmin could not ask for such a donation, so prayed to make the Brahmin aware of his actual form
 brahmanroopi shri krishna apane vaastavik rup main aa gayi
 Shri Krishna explained the reason for seeking the head donation to Barbarik that before the commencement of war, for the battleground worship, the best Kshatriya head of the three worlds has to be sacrificed; So they were compelled to do so
 barbaric ne unase prarthana kii ki ve ant tak yuddh dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Shri Krishna accepted his prayer
 shri krishna is balidaan se prasann hokar barbaric ko yuddh main sarvshereshth vir kii oopaadhi se alankrita kiya
 His head was embellished on a hill near the battlefield; From where Barbarik could take stock of the entire war
 phalgun maah kii dwadashi ko unhone apane sheesh kaa daan diya tha is prakaar ve sheesh ke dani kahalaaye
 At the end of the Mahabharata war, there was a mutual dispute among the Pandavas as to who goes to the credit of victory in the war? Shri Krishna said to him that the head of Barbarika is witness to the entire war, so who can be better decisive than that? Everyone agreed and walked towards the hill, after reaching there, the head of Barbarik replied that Shri Krishna is the greatest character in winning the war, his education, presence, and strategy were decisive
 unhen yubhumi main sirf unka sudarshan chakra ghumta hua dikhaayi de rahaa tha jo shatru sena ko kaat rahaa tha
 Mahakali, on Krishna's orders, was consuming blood-filled cups of the enemy army
 shri krishna vir barbaric ke mahaan balidaan se kaaphi prasann hue or vardaan diya ki kaliyug main tum shyaam naam se jane jaaoge, kyonki us yug main haare hue kaa saath dene vaala hi shyaam naam dhaaran karne main samarth he
 His head was buried in Khatu Nagar, hence he is called Khatu Shyam Baba
 ek gaay us sthaan par aakar roj apane stanon se dugdh kii dhara swatah hi baha rahi thi
 Later, after the excavation, the head appeared, which was surrendered to a Brahmin for a few days
 ek baar khatu nagar ke raja ko swapn main mandir nirmaan ke liye or vah sheesh mandir main sushobhit karne ke liye prerit kiya gaya
 Subsequently the temple was built at that place and Ekadashi of Kartik month was decorated in the Sheesh Temple, which is celebrated as Baba Shyam's birthday
 mul mandir 1027 i

 Diwan Abhay Singh of Thakur, the ruler of Marwar, renovated the temple in 1720 AD on the instruction of Thakur

 The idol is made of rare stone
 khatushyam pariwaron kii ek badi sankhya ke parivaar devtaa he
 Shri Khatu Shyam ji's name was Barbarik in his childhood
 unki mata, gurujan evam rishtedaar unhen isi naam se jaanate the
 The name Shyam was given to him by Krishna
 inkaa yah naam inke ghunghraale bal hone ke kaaran padaa
 His story begins in the middle Mahabharata
 khatushyam ji pehle barbaric ke naam se jane jate the ve atibalashali bhim ke putr ghatotkach or naag kanya hidimbi ke putr the khatushyam ji 
 Khatu Shyam ji was very strong and brave from childhood, he learned martial arts from his mother Hidimbi and Lord Krishna
 unhone bhagavan shiv kii aradhana karke bhagavan shiv se teen anokhe baan praapt kiye the 
 In this way he came to be known as Teen Bana Dhari
 agni dev ne prasann hokar unhen dhanush pradaan kiye jo unhen tino loko main vijay dilaa saktaa tha jab mahabharat kaa yuddh corwo or pandavo ke bich chal rahaa tha jab yah baat barbaric ko pataa chali to unki bhi ichha yuddh karne kii hue 
 He went to his mother and said that i also have to fight Mahabharata, then whose mother said, son, on whose behalf will you fight
 tab unhone bolaa main haare hue kii taraf se yuddh karuga 
 While he was going to war he found a Shri Krishna on the way
 unhone poocha tum kaha ja rahe ho 
 Then Barbarik told the whole thing
 shri krishna ji bole kalyug main log tumhe shyaam ke naam se jaanege | kuki kii tum haarane vaale ke saath ho | kuki barbaric kaa sheesh khatu nagar main dafnaaya gaya tha isliye unhen khatushyam ji kehete he According to the Skanda Purana, composed by sage Ved Vyasa, Mahabali Bhima and Hidimba's son Veer Ghatotkacha won the contest for the debate on the debate over Kamakantankata, daughter of King Daityaraja Moore of Pragjyotishpur
 kamkatankakata ko "morvi" naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Ghatotkacha and Mata Morvi received a son Ratna, whose hair was like Babbar's lion and was named Barbarik
 ye vahi vir barbaric hai jinhen aaj log khatu ke shri shyaam, kalyug ke avatar, shyaam sarkaar, teen bandhari, sheesh ke dani, khatu naresh va anya anginat naamon se jane jate hai
 After the birth of Barbarik, Mahabali Ghatotkacha took him to Lord Krishna in Dwarka and upon seeing him, Shri Krishna said to Veer Barbarik - o son Morvey! Just like i love Ghatotkacha, similarly you also love me
 tatpashchaat vir barbaric ne shri krishna se poocha— he prabhu! is jivan kaa sarvottam upyog kya he? vir barbaric ke is nishtol prashn ko sunate hi shri krishna ne kaha— he putr, is jivan kaa sarvottam upyog, paroapkaar va nirbal kaa saathi banakar sadaiv dharm kaa saath dene se he
 For which you will have to earn strength and powers
 atev tum mahisagar kshetra main navadurga kii aradhana kar shaktiyaan arjan karo
 At the behest of Shri Krishna, child Barbarik bowed to God
 shri krishna ne unke saral hriday ko dekhakar vir barbaric ko "suhriday" naam se alankrita kiya
 After that Barbarik, having acquired all the weapons and knowledge, worshiped Navadurga for 3 years in the Mahisagar region, pleased with true devotion and austerity, Bhagwati Jagadamba appeared in front of Veer Barbarik and gave him three arrows and many powers, so that the three worlds Could be conquered
 yahan unhen "chandil" naam mila
 Maa Jagadamba was intrusted by instructing Veer Barbarik to complete the accomplishment of a Brahmin named Vijay, his supreme devotee in the same area
 jab vijay brahman kaa aagaman hua to vir barbaric ne pingal, repalendra, duhadruha tathaa nau koti mansabhakshi palasi rakshason ke janglerupi samooh ko agni kii bhanti bhasma karke unka yajna sampoorn karaayaa
 On completion of the Yagna of that Brahmin, the god-goddess Veer was very pleased with Barbarik and appeared and bestowed the illustrious powers of Yajna
 ek baar kii baat he barbaric ne prithvi or pataal ke bich raste main naag kanyaon kaa varan prastaav yah kahkar thukraa diya ki unhone aaajeevan brahmacharee rahane kaa pran liya he
 At the commencement of the Mahabharata war, Veer Barbarik expressed his desire to participate in the war in front of his mother Morvi
 tab mata ne inhen yuddh main bhaag lene kii ajna is vachan ke saath di kii tum yuddh main haarane vaale paksh kaa saath nibhaaoge
 When Veer went to participate in the Barbaric War, Lord Shri Krishna had preceded the Mahabharata war because of the low curse received by Brahma ji of his former birth and thinking that if the Veer would participate in the Barbaric war, the Kauravas would end the Mahabharata in just 18 days
 Cannot be in war and defeat of Pandavas will be sure
 aisa sochakar shri krishna ne vir barbaric kaa shirochhedan kar mahabharat yuddh se vanchit kar diya
 As he did this, a wave of mourning ran in the battlefield, 14 goddesses immediately appeared in the battlefield
 deviyon ne vir barbaric ke purv janm ko brahma ji dwaara praapt shraap kaa rahasyodghatan sabhi upasthit yoddhaon ke samaksh nimna prakaar kiya— The ladies said: "before the beginning of Dwaparyuga, distressed by the tyranny of the Moore monster, Prithvi appeared in his cow form and spoke in the House of Gods," o Gods! i am able to bear all kinds of anguish
 pahaad, nadi, naale evam samast maanav jati kaa bhaar main saharsha sahan karti hui apni dainik kriyaaon kaa sanchaalan bhalee bhanti karti rahati hoon, par moore daitya ke atyaacharon se ati du:khee hoon
 You protect me from this misdeed, i have come to your shelter
 ” Listening to the pitiful call of Gauswarupa Dhara, there was complete silence in the whole assembly
 thodi der ke maun ke pashchaat brahma ji ne kaha— “ab to isse chhutkaaraa paane kaa ek maatr upaay yahi he ki ham sabhi ko bhagavan vishnu kii sharan main chalanaa chahie or prithvi ke is sankat nivaaran hetu unase prarthana kerani chahie
 " tabhi devsabha main virajman yaksharaj suryavarcha ne apni ojasvi vaani main kaha— "he devgan! moore daitya itnaa pratapi nahin, jiskaa sanhaar keval vishnu ji hi kar saken
 We should not trouble them for everything
 aaplog yadi mujhe ajna den to main hi uskaa vadh kar saktaa hoon
 " itnaa sunate hi brahma ji bole— “nadaan! main tera parakram jaanata hoon, tumhaare ahankaar ne is devsabha ko chunauti di he
 You will surely get its punishment
 apane aap ko vishnu ji se shreshth samajhane vaale agyani! tum is devsabha se abhi prithvi par ja giroge
 You will be born in a demon's vagina and when there will be a fierce crusade on earth in the last phase of Dwaparyug only then your head will be by Lord Vishnu himself and you will be a demon forever
 " With this curse of Brahmaji, the false pride of Yaksharaj Suryavarcha also crumbled
 vah tatkaal brahma ji ke charnon main gir padaa or vinamr bhav se bolaa— “bhagwan! bhulvash nikle in shabdon ke liye mujhe kshamaa kar dijie main aapke sharnaagat hoon
 Triamam! Triamam! God save! " yah sunakar brahma ji main karun bhav umad pade, vah bole— “vatsa! tune abhimaanavash devsabha kaa apmaan kiya he, isliye main is abhishaap ko waapas nahin le saktaa hoon
 Yes, i can make amends in this that Lord Krishna himself will dissect you with his Sudarshan Chakra, your head will be attested by the ladies
 faltah tumhen kalyug main devataaon ke samaan poojaneey hone kaa vardaan swayan bhagavan shri krishna bhagwaan se praapt hoga
 " tatpashchaat bhagavan shri hari ne bhi is prakaar yaksharaj suryavarcha se kaha— Tattateteti tah praha keshav devasandi! Shiraste Pujayishyanti Devya: Pujyo Bhavishya !! bhavarth: "us samay devataaon kii sabha main shri hari ne kaha— he vir! thik he, tumhaare sheesh kii puja hogi or tum devaroop main poojit hokar prasiddhi paaoge

 Therefore, all of you should not grieve over this and there is no fault of Shri Krishna in this

 Veer Barbarik told his strong desire to see the battle of Mahabharata in front of Lord Shri Krishna, which Shri Krishna completed Veer Barbarik's deity head on high mountain and got his body cremated by scripture method 


 mahabharat yuddh kii samaapti par pandavon main hi aapasi bahes chhid gayi ki yuddh main vijay kaa shrey kisko jaataa he
 Shri Krishna said that the head of Barbarik should be asked whose might he has seen in this war
 tab vir barbaric ke sheesh ne uttar diya ki yah yuddh keval bhagwaan shri krishna kii niti ke kaaran jeeta gaya he or is yuddh main keval bhagavan shri krishna kaa sudarshan chakra chal rahaa tha
 The whole constellation was raised as soon as Veera Barbaric said this and the head started to rain on the head and the Gods conned it
 tatpashchaat bhagavan shri krishna ne punah vir barbaric ke sheesh ko pranaam karte hue kaha— "he vir barbaric aap kaliyug main sarvatra poojit hokar apane sabhi bhakton ke abhisht kaary ko purna karoge
 Therefore, you should not abandon this area, please forgive the crimes that have happened to us
 " Hearing this, a wave of joy ran in the Pandava army
 sainikon ne pavitra tirthon ke jal se sheesh ko punah sinchit kiya or apni vijay dhwaja sheesh ke sameep fahraaye
 On this day, everyone celebrated the festival of Mahabharata with great pomp
 veeravar morviinandan shri barbaric kaa charitra skanda puraana ke "maheshwar khand ke antargat dwitiya upkhand 'comarik khand'" main suvistaarpurvak diya hua he
 The sage Ved Vyas ji has also praised him in this supernatural source in the 115th and 116th verses of the 66th chapter of the "kaumarika Khanda, the second subdivision of the Maheshwar Khand" in the Skanda Purana
 jab shri krishna ne unase unke sheesh kii maang kii to unhone apana sheesh bina kisi jhijak ke unako arpit kar diya or bhakt unhen sheesh ke dani ke naam se pukaarane lage
 Shri Krishna wanted to make the Pandavas victorious in the war
 barbaric pehle hi apni maan ko haare hue kaa saath dene kaa vachan de chuke the or yuddh ke pehle ek vir purush ke sir kii bhent yubhumipujan ke liye kerani thi isliye shri krishna ne unase sheesh kaa daan maanga
 Devotees believe that if something is asked from Baba, then Baba gives it millions of times, that is why he is also known as Lakhdatar
 jaisaa ki is aalekh me bataaya gaya he baba ne haarane vaale paksh kaa saath dene kaa pran liya tha, isiilie baba ko haare kaa sahaara bhi kaha jaataa he
 Only because of the pledge to fight on behalf of the loser and the order from Grandmother Hidimba
 bhagwaan shri krishna kii man main uthi samasya ke kaaran hi barbaric va baba ke sheesh ko bhagwaan vasudev dwaara maanga gaya
 Because one Kuru army could not be finished before eighteen days
 tathaa anya tathy yah tha ki mahabali barbaric haare hue kamjor kii taraf se yuddh karte is liye ant main mahabali barbaric ke ilaava koi nahi bachataa
 Because from which side he fought, the front would become weak
 phir apni pratigya anusaar unhen haare hue kii taraf se yuddh karnaa hota
 So in the end only Mahabali Barbarik would have survived
 baba hameshaa mayur ke pankhons kii bani hui chadi rakhte hai isliye inhen morchadi vaala bhi kehete hai
 The character of Veerwar Morveenandan Shri Barbarik ji is elaborated in the "second subdivision 'qomarik Khand' under Maheshwar Khand" in Skanda Purana

 Splenomegaly is defined as a spleen larger than 12 cm when ultrasound is measured near its long amplitude
 paulen or anya splanomegali ko nimna bhaagon main vargeekrut karte hai: Splenomegaly should not be confused with hypersplenism

 However, the underlying cause of hypersplenism is highly likely to persist, so a complete diagnostic process is needed as leukemia, lymphoma, and other serious disorders can lead to hypersplenism and splenomegaly
