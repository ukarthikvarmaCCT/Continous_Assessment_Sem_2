 Tomar or Tanwar was a Gurjar Vansh of northwest India
 tomaro kaa maananaa he ki ve chandravanshi he
 He founded the present Delhi with the name of Dihilika
 puraanon se prathit hota he ki aarambh main tomaron kaa nivas himalay ke nearesth kisi uttari pradesh main tha
 But by the 10th century they had reached Karnal
 thaneshwar main bhi inkaa rajya tha
 At that time, there was the kingdom of Gurjara Pratihara Rajavansh of Kanyakubj in North India

 The 12 villages of Tanwar Gurjaro are in the vicinity of Delhi Fatehpur The Tomar dynasty of delhi-thaneshwar was in a fairly advanced state during the initial invasions of the Ghaznavi dynasty
 tomarsraj ne thaneshwar ko mahmud se bachaane kaa praytn bhi kiya, yadhyapi use safalataa na mili
 In 1038 AD Mahmud's son Masood took over Hansi
 masood ke putr majdood ne thaneshwar ko hastgat kiya
 Preparations were started to attack Delhi
 aisa prathit hota tha ki musalmaan dilli rajya kii samaapti kiye bina chaiyn na lenge
 But the Tomars acted with courage
 tomarsraj mahipal ne keval haansi or thaneshwar ke durg hi hastgat na kiye; uski vir vahini ne kongde par bhi apni vijayadhvaja kuch samay ke liye fahraa di
 Lahore also survived fortunately
 tomaron kii is vijay se keval vidveshagni hi bhadki
 Tomars were attacked from here and there
 tanwaron ne inkaa yathashakti uttar diya
 From the Parshaanatharcharita of Sridhar Kavi, composed in Samvat 1189, it appears that the capital of the Tomars at that time was Delhi's prosperous city and Tanvaraj Anangpal was famous everywhere due to his bravery and qualities
 dwitiya anangpal ne mehroli ke louh stambh kii dilli main sthapana kii
 It was probably during this king that the towers changed their policy
 bisaldev tritiy na sanwat 1208 main tomaron ko haraa kar dilli par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, Tanwar ruled as the feudatories of the Chauhans in Delhi

 Pollution is generally classified into fixed point and unknown nonpoint source pollution
 taypoint strot pradooshan tab hota he jab pradooshan kaa iklauta, spasht or sthaneey strot maujuud ho
 An example of this is the direct release of industrial waste and dirt into the oceans
 is tarah kaa pradooshan khaastaur par vikasshil deshon main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Nonpoint source pollution occurs when pollution occurs from obscure and scattered sources
 inhen niyantrit karnaa bahut mushkil ho saktaa he
 Agricultural runoff and airflow waste are prime examples of this
 pradooshak nadiyon or sagaron main shahari naalon or audyogic kachare ke nissaran se sidhe pravesh karte hai, kabhi-kabhi hanikaarak or zahreele kachare ke rup main bhi
 Mining of copper, gold etc
 in the interiors is another source of marine pollution
 zyaadaatar pradooshan mahaz mitti se hota he, jo nadiyon ke saath behate hue samudr main pravesh karti he
 However, the extraction of minerals during mining can cause many problems, such as copper, which is a common industrial pollutant, which can harm the life cycle and growth of coral

 In addition to being toxic to marine life, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are present in crude oil, are very difficult to clean and remain in sediment and marine environments for many years
 malwahak jahaazon dwaara kooda-kabar kaa choda janaa bandargahon, jalmargon or mahasaagaron ko pradooshit kar saktaa he
 Many times vessels deliberately release illegal wastes despite such actions being prohibited by foreign and domestic regulations
 anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki container dhone vaale malwahak jahaaz har saal samudr main das hazaar se zyada container samudr main kho dete hai 
 Ships also cause noise pollution, which disturbs the fauna and the water released from the stagnant tanks can spread harmful algae and other fast-growing invasive species

 To reduce climate change, it is important to have a healthy ocean ecosystem
 samudr tal khanan, khanijon ke khanan kii ek apekshaakrit nai takanic he jo samudr tal main amal main laai jaati he
 Mining locations in the oceans are generally around 1,400–3,700 m below sea level, over large stretches of polymetallic nodules, or around active and extinct hydrothermal pores
 ye chhidr sulphid bhandar banaate hai jinmein chaandi, sona, tamba, manganeez or cobalt or jastajaisi utkrisht dhaatuen maujuud hoti hai
 These deposits are mined by hydraulic pumps or bucket systems whereby ore is brought to the ground for refining
 jaisaa sabhi khanan prakriyaaon ke saath he, samudr tal khanan se aasapaas ke kshetra main paryaavaran ko hone vaale nuksaan par bhi sawaal uthe hai
 Because sea level mining is a relatively new field, the outcome of the full-scale mining process is still unknown
 haalanki visheshgyon ko purna vishwaas he ki samudr tal ke hisson ke hataane se benthic parat main gadabadi hogi, pani stambh main vishaaktata badhegi or cediment plums main badhautari hogi
 Removing parts of the ocean floor will damage the natural habitat of benthic animals, disturbances may also be permanent, depending on the type and location of mining
 kshetra ke khanan se padane vaale sidhe prabhaav ke alaava, risaav or kshay bhi khanan kshetra kii rasaynic banaavat ko badal saktaa he
 Among the effects of sea level mining, sediment plumes may have the greatest impact
 plums tab banate hai jab khanan se niklaa malba samudr main waapas phenk diya jaataa he, jisase pani main kanon ke badal se tairne lagate hai
 There are two types of plumes: those found on the sea floor and those found on the surface
 Plumes found at sea level are formed when debris is pumped back down into the mining location
 ye tairte hue kan pani ke gandalepan ko badha dete hai or benthic jeevon dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale filter-feeding upkarnon ko avaruddh kar dete hai
 Plumes on the surface lead to an even more serious problem

 jab ek prajati ooncha bolne lagati he to ye duusari prajatiyon kii awaz ko dabaa detii he, jisase puraa paristithik tantra ooncha bolne lagata he
 According to ocean scientist Sylvia Earl, "sound pollution inside the marine is equivalent to dying with a thousand wounds
 har dhwani bhale hi badi chintaa kaa vishay naa ho, lekin agar jahaazon ke shor, bukampiy surveykshan or sainya gatividhiyon ko ek saath liya jaae to ek bilkul hi alag maahaul taiyaar ho jaataa he jo pachaas saal pehle bhi maujuud tha
 This increased level of noise pollution will have a stronger and wider impact on marine life
 " jyadatar maanavajanit pradooshan samudr main pravesh karata he
 As Björn Jenson wrote in his article, "anthropogenic pollution can decrease the biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems, reducing and depleting human seafood resources"
 pradooshan ke is samgr str ko kam karne ke do tareeke hai: yaa maanav jansankhya gata di jaae, yaa phir ek aam insaan dwaara chode gaye paristhitik padchihnon ko kam karne kaa rasta khoja jaae
 agar ye doosraa rasta nahin apanaaya gaya, to phir pehla rasta thapana pad saktaa he, kyonki duniya ke paristhitik tantra gadabada rahe hai
 The second way is for humans to spread less pollution personally
 This requires social and political will, as well as to create awareness so that more people respect the environment and harm it less
 At the operational level, rules and international governments need to participate
 samudri pradooshan ko niyantrit karnaa aksar mushkil hota he kyonki pradooshan antarrashtriya sarhadon ko laanghta he, jisase niyam bananaa or unhen lagu karnaa kathin hota he
 Perhaps the most important strategic policy to reduce marine pollution is education
 zyaadaatar log sroton or samudri pradooshan ke hanikaarak prabhaavon se anjaan hai or isliye is sthiti se nipatane ke liye kam kadam hi uthaae ja sake hai
 In order to make the public aware of all the facts, intensive research is needed to give full details of the situation

 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth

 He then completed his law degree from Cambridge University
 england main unhone saat saal vyateet kiye jisamen vahaan ke fabian samaajwaad or irish rashtrawaad ke liye ek tarksangat drushtikon viksit kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer

 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both
 nehru ji swabhaav se hi swadhyaayi the
 He studied great texts

 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he
 The solution to the extreme lack of time for writing in the busiest struggling days of political life was to make the long dull days of jail a creative one
 isliye unki adhikansh pustaken jail main hi likhi gayi hai
 In his writings, a mixed form of the spirit of a litterateur and the searching heart of a historian has emerged
 indira gandhi ko kaalpanik patr likhane ke bahaane unhone vishwa itihaas kaa adhyay-dar-adhyay likh daalaa
 These letters were never actually sent, but by this, a simple communicative and well-written text like a glimpse of world history was easily prepared

 He is counted among the greatest mathematics thinkers of the modern period
 inhen ganit main koi vishesh prashikshan nahin mila, phir bhi inhone vishleshan evam sankhya siddhant ke kshetron main gahan yogadan die
 With his talent and dedication, he not only made amazing innovations in the field of Mathematics but also gave India an incomparable pride
 ye bachapan se hi vilakshan pratibhavan the
 He learned mathematics by himself and compiled 3,884 theorems of mathematics throughout his life
 inamen se adhikansh prameya sahi siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 He drew many fundamental and unconventional results on the strength of the intuitive knowledge of mathematics and the unique talent of algebraic hypothesis, which inspired research to date, although some of his discoveries have not yet been adopted into the mathematics mainstream
 haal main inke sutron ko crystal-vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya he
 Ramanujan Journal has been established for the work being done in the areas of mathematics affected by his work
 ramanujan kaa janm 22 disambar1887 ko bharat ke dakshini bhubhag main sthit coimbatore ke erod naamake gaanv main hua tha
 He was born in a traditional Brahmin family
 inaki kii mata kaa naam komaltammal or inke pita kaa naam shrinivas ayyangar tha
 His childhood was spent mainly in Kumbakonam, which is known for its ancient temples
 bachapan main ramanujan kaa bauddhik vikaas saamaanya baalkon jaisaa nahin tha
 He did not even learn to speak until he was three years old
 jab itani badi aayu tak jab ramanujan ne bolnaa aarambh nahin kiya to sabko chintaa hui ki kahin yah gunge to nahin hai
 In later years, when he entered school, he never felt in traditional education
 ramanujan ne das varshon kii aayu main primary pariksha main puure jile main sabase adhik ank praapt kiya or aage kii shiksha ke liye toun hiskool pahunche
 Ramanujan loved asking questions
 unke prashn adhyapakon ko kabhi-kabhi bahut atapate lagate the
 Like - who was the first man in the world? What is the distance between earth and clouds? Ramanujan's behavior was very sweet
 inkaa saamaanya se kuch adhik sthool sharir or jigyaasa se chamakati aakhen inhen ek alag hi pahchaan detii thim
 According to their classmates, their behavior was so gentle that no one could get angry with them
 vidhyalay main inaki pratibha ne duusare vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon par chhap chhodana aarambh kar diya
 He had studied college level mathematics during his school time
 ek baar inke vidhyalay ke pradhanadhyaapak ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vidhyalay main hone vaali parikshaon ke maapdand ramanujan ke liye lagu nahin hote hai
 After passing the high school examination, he received a Subramanian scholarship for scoring good marks in Mathematics and English and also got admission for further college education
 aage ek pareshaani ai
 Ramanujan's love for mathematics had grown so much that he did not pay attention to other subjects
 yahaan tak kii ve itihaas, jeev vigyaan kii kakshaon main bhi ganit ke prashnon ko hal kiya karte the
 As a result, in the eleventh grade examination, he failed in all subjects except mathematics and as a result he stopped getting scholarship
 ek to ghar kii aarthik sthiti kharaab or upar se chaatravrutti bhi nahin mil rahi thi
 This was a very difficult time for Ramanujan
 ghar kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye inhone ganit ke kuch tution tathaa khate-bahi kaa kaam bhi kiya
 Sometime later in 1907 Ramanujan again took the private examination of class XII and failed
 or isi ke saath inke paaramparik shiksha kii itishree ho gai
 The five years after leaving school were very frustrating for him
 bharat is samay paratantraa kii bediyon main jakadaaa tha
 There was severe poverty everywhere
 aise samay main ramanujan ke paas na koi naukari thi or na hi kisi santhaan athwa professor ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka
 His unwavering faith in God and deep reverence for mathematics always inspired him to follow the path of duty
 namgiri devi ramanujan ke parivaar kii isht devi thim
 Unwavering faith in him did not let him stay anywhere and he continued to conduct his research of mathematics even under such adverse circumstances
 is samay ramanujan ko tution se kul paanch rupaye masik milte the or isi main guzaara hota tha
 This life span of Ramanujan was full of grief and sorrow
 inhen hameshaa apane bharan-poshan ke liye or apni shiksha ko jari rakhane ke liye idhar udhar bhatakana padaa or anek logon se asafal yachana bhi kerani padi
 In the year 1908, his parents married him to a girl named Janaki
 vivaah ho jane ke baad ab inke liye sab kuch bhul kar ganit main doobana sambhav nahin tha
 Hence, he came to Madras in search of a job
 barahavin kii pariksha uteern na hone kii vajah se inhen naukari nahin mili or unka swasthya bhi buree tarah gir gaya
 Now on the advice of the doctor, he had to return to his home in Kumbakonam
 beemaari se thik hone ke baad ve waapas madras aae or phir se naukari kii talash shuru kar di
 Whenever he met someone, he used to show him a register of his own
 is register main inke dwaara ganit main kiye gaye saare kaary hote the
 At the same time, at the behest of someone, Ramanujan met Mr
 V
 Ramaswamy Iyer, the deputy collector there
 ayyar ganit ke bahut bade vidwaan the
 Here, Mr
 Iyer recognized the talent of Ramanujan and after asking District Magistrate Mr
 Ramchandra Rao, he also arranged a monthly scholarship of Rs
 25 for him
 is vritti par ramanujan ne madras main ek saal rahete hue apana pratham shodhpatr prakashit kiya
 The title of the research paper was "some properties of Bernoulli numbers" and this research paper was published in Journal of Indian Mathematical Society
 yahaan ek saal puraa hone par inhone madras port trust main clerk kii naukari kii
 Fortunately, there was not much work load in this job and here they used to get enough time for their mathematics
 yahaan par ramanujan raat bhar jaag kar nae-nae ganit ke sutara likhaa karte the or phir thodi der tak aaraam kar ke phir daftar ke liye nikal jate the
 Ramanujan used to write mathematics research on slate
 or baad main use ek register main likh lete the
 At night the sleep of other members of the family was disturbed due to the sound of Ramanujan's slate and pillar
 is samay bhartiya or pashchimi rahan sahan main ek badi duuri thi or is vajah se saamanytah bharatiyon ko angrej vaigyanikon ke saamne apane baton ko prastut karne main kaaphi sankoch hota tha
 The situation here was such that research work could not be carried forward without the help of an English mathematician
 is samay ramanujan ke puraane shubhachintak inke kaam aae or in logon ne ramanujan dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko landan ke prasiddh ganitagyon ke paas bheja
 But here they did not get any special help but one benefit was that people had come to know Ramanujan a little bit
 isi samay ramanujan ne apane sankhya siddhant ke kuch sutara professor sheshu ayyar ko dikhaae to unka dhyaan landan ke hi professor hardi kii taraf gaya
 Professor Hardy was one of the world's famous mathematicians of the time
 or apane sakht swabhaav or anushaasan priyata ke kaaran jane jate the
 After reading Professor Hardy's research work, Ramanujan said that he has found the answer to the unanswered question of Professor Hardy
 ab ramanujan kaa professor hardi se patravyavhaar aarambh hua
 From here on, a new era in Ramanujan's life began in which Professor Hardy had a very big role
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to jis tarah se ek johari heere kii pahchaan karata he or use taraash kar chamakaa detaa he, ramanujan ke jivan main vaisaa hi kuch sthaan professor hardi kaa he
 Professor Hardy was an admirer of Ramanujan's life and philosophy of life
 ramanujan or professor hardi kii yah mitrataa dono hi ke liye laabhprad siddh hui
 In a way, both of them worked complementary to each other
 professor hardi ne us samay ke vibhinn pratibhashali vyaktiyon ko 100 ke paimaane par aanka tha
 He gave 35 marks to most mathematicians and 60 marks to some specific persons
 lekin unhone ramanujan ko 100 main puure 100 ank die the
 Initially, when Ramanujan sent his research work to Professor Hardy, at first he did not even understand
 jab unhone apane mitra ganitagyon se salaah lee to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki ramanujan ganit ke kshetra main ek durlabh vyaktitv he or inke dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko thik se samajhane or usamen aage shodh ke liye unhen england aana chahie
 So he invited Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 kuch vyaktigat kaarnon or dhan kii kami ke kaaran ramanujan ne professor hardi ke cambridge ke aamantran ko asweekaar kar diya
 Professor Hardy was disappointed by this but somehow decided to call Ramanujan there
 isi samay ramanujan ko madras vishvavidhyalay main shodh vritti mil gai thi jisase unka jivan kuch saral ho gaya or unako shodhakarya ke liye puraa samay bhi milane laga tha
 Meanwhile, after a long correspondence, slowly, Professor Hardy agreed Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 professor hardi ke prayaason se ramanujan ko cambridge jane ke liye aarthik sahaayta bhi mil gai
 Ramanujan had written over 3000 new sources of mathematics in his notebook before leaving for England
 ramanujan ne landan kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Professor Hardy had already arranged for him there, so he did not face any particular problem
 england main ramanujan ko bas thodi pareshaani thi or iskaa kaaran tha unka sharmila, shant swabhaav or shuddh satvik jeevancharya
 Throughout his stay in England, he mostly cooked his own food
 england kii is yatra se unke jivan main krantikari parivartan aayaa
 He, along with Professor Hardy, published high-quality research papers
 apane ek vishesh shodh ke kaaran inhen cambridge vishvavidhyalay dwaara bi
e
 kii oopaadhi bhi mili
 But the climate and living style there was not very favorable to him and his health started deteriorating
 doctoron ne ise kshay rog bataaya
 At that time there was no tuberculosis medicine and the patient had to stay in the sanatorium
 ramanujan ko bhi kuch dinon tak vahaan rahanaa padaa
 Even at this time, he used to make new imaginations in the mathematical formulas
 iske baad vahaan ramanujan ko royal socity kaa phelo namit kiya gaya
 At a time when India was living in slavery, it was a great thing for a black person to get membership of the Royal Society
 royal socity ke puure itihaas main inase kam aayu kaa koi sadsy aaj tak nahin hua he
 His well-wishers celebrated and held gatherings all over India
 royal socity kii sadsyta ke baad yah triniti college kii fellowship paane vaale pehle bhartiya bhi bane
 Now it seemed that everything was going to a very good place
 lekin ramanujan kaa swasthya girtaa ja rahaa tha or ant main doctoron kii salaah par unhen waapas bharat lautnaa padaa
 On coming to India, he got a professor job at Madras University
 or ramanujan adhyaapan or shodh kaary main punah ram gaye
 Even after returning to India, health did not support them and the condition was getting serious
 is beemaari kii dasha main bhi inhone mock theta function par ek ucch stareey shodhpatr likhaa
 This function, propounded by Ramanujan, is used not only in mathematics but also in medical science to understand cancer
 inkaa girtaa swasthya sabake liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya or yahaan tak kii ab doctoron ne bhijawab de diya tha
 Finally, the moment of Ramanujan's departure arrived
 26 april1920 ke praatah kaal main ve achet ho gaye or dopaher hote hote unhone praan tyaag die
 At this time Ramanujan's age was only 33 years
 inkaa asamay nidhan ganit jagat ke liye apurnty kshati tha
 Whoever heard the news of Ramanujan's death in the whole country and abroad was shocked
 ramanujan or inke dwaara kiye gaye adhikansh kaary abhi bhi vaigyanikon ke liye abujh paheli bane hue hai
 In his journey to surprise the whole world by taking birth in a very common family, he gave India unprecedented glory
 inkaa unka vah purana register jis par ve apane prameya or sutron ko likhaa karte the 1976 main achaanak triniti college ke pustkaalay main mila
 This register of about one hundred pages remains a puzzle for scientists even today
 is register ko baad main ramanujan kii note book ke naam se janaa gaya
 It has also been published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai
 ramanujan ke shodhon kii tarah unke ganit main kaam karne kii style bhi vicitra thi
 He sometimes woke up in the middle of the night by writing mathematics formulas on the slate and then falling asleep
 is tarah aisa lagata tha ki ve sapane main bhi ganit ke prashn hal kar rahe hon
 Along with Ramanujan's name, his Kuldevi is also taken
 inhone shunya or anant ko hameshaa dhyaan main rakhaa or iske antarsambandhon ko samajhane ke liye ganit ke sutron kaa sahaara liya
 There was a specialty of Ramanujan's work
 pehle ve ganit kaa koi nayaa sutara yaa prameny pehle likh dete the lekin uski upapatti par utana dhyaan nahin dete the
 When asked about this, he used to say that he received this sutra by the grace of Namagiri Devi
 ramanujan kaa aadhyatm ke prati vishwaas itnaa gaharaa tha ki ve apane ganit ke kshetra main kiye gaye kisi bhi kaary ko aadhyatm kaa hi ek ang maanate the
 He not only believed in religion and spirituality but also presented it logically

 kishorilaal america main rahane vaale ek dhani vyapaaree hai jo bharat main apane puraane dost suraj dev se miltaa he
 During his stay in a conservative traditional Indian family, he came to know Suraj's eldest daughter Ganga, who is well-versed in Indian culture
 kishorilaal suraj se apane pashchimi samskruti main rache based bete rajeev ke liye ganga kaa haath maangata he
 She is confident that Ganga will not only be a perfect bride, but she will be able to revive Indian values in Rajiv
 kishorilaal apane paale hue bete arjuna se apni yojana ko aage badhaane main madad karne ke liye kahata he
 Arjun's thinking is similar to Kishori Lal and Ganga
 arjuna rajeev se pehle ganga se milane ke liye jaataa he or usase milakar mohit ho jaataa he
 Arjun, despite his attraction to Ganga, tries to unite Rajiv and Ganga as per Kishori Lal's wishes
 arjuna rajeev ke charitra or aadaton ke bare main ganga ko dhokhaa detaa he
 Both Rajiv and Ganga agree to marry each other through Arjuna's efforts
 sagaai bharat main hoti he, lekin parivaar is baat se sahamat hota he ki ganga ko apane shaadi se pehle america janaa chahie
 Ganga feels alone after a few weeks
 uskaa ekmaatr sachcha dost arjuna he jiske saath vah ek vishesh bandhan bananaa shuru kar detii he
 Gradually, Ganga realizes that Rajiv is not the person Arjuna portrayed him in India
 arjuna ko pataa chalata he ki vah ganga se pyaar main pad gaya he
 But because of his loyalty to Kishori Lal, he encourages her to continue the engagement and later worries about changing Rajiv
 rajeev kii shatrutapurna chachee nita ne ganga or arjuna ke bich badhati dosti kii ore dhyaan diya or kishorilaal ko chetavanee di
 He arranges to transfer Arjuna
 phir kishorilaal las vegas main ganga ke saath rahane ke liye rajeev ke liye ek choti si chuttee kii yojana banaata he
 In Las Vegas, Rajiv gets drunk and his contempt for his fellow Indians is revealed
 bahes main ganga ne rajeev ko thappad maar diya
 Furious, he tries to rape Ganga; After a violent struggle, she knocks him unconscious and runs away
 rajeev kishorilaal ko suchit karata he jo jald gaayab ganga kii talash shuru karte hai
 Arjun finds Ganga crying at the train station
 vah use kishorilaal ke ghar waapas jane ke liye raji karne kii koshish karata he, lekin usne manaa kar diya
 Arjun promises to help her return safely to her family in India
 arjuna or ganga ke surakshit rup se bharat pahunchane ke baad, kishorilaal suraj ko suchit karata he ki arjuna ganga se saath bhaag gaya he
 Then Arjun departs, intending never to return
 ganga ke chote bhai bahan or daadi chupake se usko arjuna ke saath bhaagane kii salaah dete hai
 Now Ganga realizes that she is in love with Arjun and secretly leaves the house with his help
 is samay tak, kishorilaal rajeev ke saath bharat aate hai
 Ganga catches Arjun in a temple and demands that he express his love but Arjun is still loyal to Kishori Lal and refuses to marry her
 arjuna ko maarane ke liye rajeev kai thagon ke saath aata he
 In the ensuing battle, Arjun is badly beaten but eventually kills everyone
 jaise hi arjuna rajeev ko maarane vaala hota he, kishorilaal suraj ke saath aata he
 Arjun tells Kishori Lal that he really loves Ganga, accepting it
 vah pushti karata he ki usne kabhi uskaa peechha nahin kiya or sammanpurvak vyaavhaar kiya, jabaki rajeev ne har tarah se sammanjanak karrwai ko khaarij kar diya or is bare main jhooth bolaa ki ganga kyon bharat laut ai
 Not only is the Ganges unable to merge with Western culture but Western value almost completely ruined the Ganges
 ganga rajeev ke balaatkaar kii koshish kii pushti karti he, jo har kisi ko jhatka detaa he
 Realizing that she has actually heard the truth, Kishorelal confirms that Ganga will marry her son
 rajeev ko asweekaar karte hue, unhone arjuna ko apane sachche putr ke rup main gale laga liya or suraj or uske parivaar ke saath arjuna or ganga ke bich aagaamee vivaah kaa aashirwad diya

 Archeopteryx is not alive on Earth today, hence it is also called extinct

 There is no suitable evidence of prototype in the period to which geology has reached

 Subsequently, Hermann Fon Mayer named the altarprint Archeopteryx lithographica

 The inscription on the second rock with a skeleton was that of another protagonist

 This second impression became a puzzle

 In 1877, another replica of Archeopteryx was found in a stone mine, about ten miles from the first location

 This impression, which is secured in two stones, is also the mark of the skull and in all things it is better than the Londoner specimen

 After receiving the stones of Archeopteryx, their study began
 inke adhyayan ke lagbhag 36 prayaas ab tak ho chuke hai
 The last attempt was made in 1945 by Sir Gavin de Beer, the director of the British Museum
 unhone is adhyayan ke liye eks-re tathaa ultrawilet kirnon kaa bhi prayog kiya
 Sir Gavin's study confirmed the following: 1
 landan musium ke jeevashmon kii caroti main ab tak jitani haddiyon kii gananaa kii gai thi usase ve adhik hai; 2
 The brain of this undeveloped bird was much like the brain of a reptile; 3

 yadi pankh aadhunik udanevaali chidiyon kii bhanti hote to unamem urakut hota, yaa mansapeshiyon ke judane ke liye ubhare nishaan hote
 This suggests that Archeopteryx was not a flying bird, only a moving bird

 Its bones are not hollow or airy, 2
 kasheruka kii banaavat tathaa jod donon sarisrup jaise hai, 3

 The palpation of the pelvis is bent backwards; 5
 karpar kii anek haddiyaan aadhunik chidiyon kii haddiyon kii bhaanti judi hai
 These mixed traits prove that Archeopteryx is the connecting link between the development of modern birds and reptiles
 iskaa arth yah nahin ki yah aadha sarisrup or aadha pakshi he, kintu yah ek aisa sarisrup tha, jisane pakshi kii ore viksit hona prarambh kar diya tha; arthath yah aadyapakshi he
 Now the question arises as to which original family Archeopteryx originated
 iskaa aakaar udanevaale sarisrup arthath terrodactile se miltaa he
 But the terodactyl had a different flying style and its bones were also different
 do chote pairon par chalanevaale kuch dianosaur bhi rachana main chidiyon ke nikat aate hai

 Civil society is made up of a composite of voluntary civil and social organizations and institutions that form the basis of a functioning society, quite distinct from government-supported structures and commercial institutions of the market
 kanoonee rajya kaa siddhant rajya or naagarik samaaj kii samanta ko apni sabase mahatvapurn visheshta maanata he
 For example, the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania defines the Lithuanian nation as "a free, just and harmonious civil society and government striving under the rule of law"
 aadhunikottar arth main naagarik samaaj kii asankhya paribhaashaayen maujuud hai
 The executive definition of the London School of Economics, the center of civil society, is illustrative: ek aitihaasik drushtikon se, naagarik samaaj kii avadharana kaa vaastavik arth, do baar apane mul, shastreey rup se parivartit hua he

 However, it has a very old history in the realm of political thought

 In the ancient era, the concept was used as a synonym for good society and was seen as indistinguishable from the state
 udhaaharan ke liye, sucraat ne shiksha di ki samaaj ke bhitari sangharsh ko sachai ujagar karne ke liye tarksangat vaarta ke ek rup, 'dwandvatmak paddati' ke upyog dwaara saarvajanik vaad-vivaad ke madhyam se niptaana chahie
 According to Socrates, debate through 'dialectical method' is essential to ensure 'citizenship' and 'good life' of the people

 Rather, he believed that the nation represents the civil form of society and 'courtesy' represents the need for good citizenship

 The Middle Ages saw major changes in topics discussed by political philosophers
 Due to the unique political system of feudalism, the classical concept of civil society practically disappeared from the mainstream of discussion

 As a result, the emperors were able to take control internally, weakening the feudatories and ceasing to depend on them for armed soldiers
 From then on, the emperor was able to form the national army and deploy professional bureaucracy and financial departments, which enabled him to maintain direct control and supreme authority over his subjects
 The emperors controlled the economy for the purpose of meeting administrative expenses
 This gave rise to dictatorship
 atharahavin sadi ke madhya tak, taanaashaahee europe kii pahchaan thi
 Controversy arose in the Enlightenment era on the autocratic nature of the state
 As a natural result of Renaissance, humanism, and the scientific revolution, enlightened thinkers have asked "what legitimacy does heredity provide?", "why is government established?", "why should some people have more fundamental rights than others?" And raised other basic questions like these
 in sawaalon ne unhen maanav man kii prakruti, raajnneetik or naitik adhikaar ke sroton, taanaashaahee ke peeche maujuud kaarnon or nirankush shashan se baahar nikalne ke bare main katipay manyataon kaa path prashast kiya
 Enlightened thinkers believed in the goodness inherent in the human mind
 unhone rajya or carch ke bich gathbandhan kaa maanav pragati or kalyaan ke shatru ke rup main virodh kiya kyonki raashtra ke balpurvak tantra vyaktigat swatantraaa par roak lagaate hai or carch ne daivi mul ke siddhant kii manyata dwaara samraaton ko uchit tehraaya
 isliye, donon hi logon kii pasand ke khilaaf maane gaye
 Specifically influenced by the horrors of the war lasting thirty years, the then political philosophers believed that social relations should be arranged differently from the conditions of human-religion
 unke kuch prayaason se saamaajik anubandh siddhant saamne aayaa jisane maanav prakruti ke anusaar maujuuda saamaajik sambandhon ko amaanya siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He believed that human nature can be understood by analyzing objective realities and natural legal conditions
 is prakaar unhone samarthit kiya ki manushya ke swabhaav main raashtra kii ruparekha or sthapit sakaaratmak kaanoon samavisht honi chahie
 Thomas Hobbes underlined the need for a powerful state to maintain civilization in society
 hobs ke liye, manushya swaarth se prerit hota he 
 iske alaava, swaarth kii prakruti aksar virodhabhasi hoti he
 Therefore, in the nature of the nation, a state of war against all was included
 aisi sthiti main, jivan "nihsang, karaab, buree, pashvik or choti" thi 
 araajaktaa kaa khatra mahasoos hone par, maanav apane bachaav ke liye ek tantra kii aavashyaktaa ke prati jaagruk hua
 As far as Hobbes was concerned, prudence and selfishness led man to join an agreement, surrender sovereignty to a common power
 Hobbes called this shared power, the nation as Timingal
 thomas hobs ke saamaajik anubandh siddhant ne do prakaar ke sambandhon ko saamne rakhaa
 ek timingal or logon ke bich sidhaa sambandh; isliye logon kaa timingal ko khud kaa samarpan
 duusari pranali logon ke bich kshaitij sambandhon kaa dayera tha
 In this system, under the supervision of Timingle, people were bound to limit their natural rights in such a way that they do not harm the rights of others
 The first system represents the nation and the second represents civilized society
 hobs ke pratimaan main, naagarik samaaj ke gathan ne sarkaar, raashtra or kanoon nirmaan kaa path prashast kiya
 Therefore, in his view, the nation is necessary to maintain civilization among the people
 is prakaar, 'raashtra kii prakruti' or 'samprabhu raashtra' ke sambandh main hobs kii avadharanaon ne yatharthwaad ke beej ankurit kiye jisane raashtra or naagarik samaaj ke bich sambandhon kii prakruti ko paribhaashit kiya
 John Locke's conception of England's political situation was similar to that of Hobbes
 yah bhavy kranti kaa yug tha, jo rajgaddi ke daivi adhikaar or sansad ke raajnneetik adhikaron ke bich sangharsh dwaara chihnit hua
 This influenced Locke to formulate the social contract theory of a limited nation and a powerful society
 loke kii drushti main, manushya prakruti ke raashtra main ashaant jivan ji rahe the
 However, in the absence of a proper system, it can be maintained at sub-optimal levels
 Out of that major concern, people gathered together to sign a contract and a Common Public Authority was formed
 phir bhi, loke kaa maananaa tha ki raajnneetik satta kaa samekan nirankushta main badal saktaa he, agar use bharosemand pratibandh ke tahat nahin laayaa jaataa he 
 isliye, loke ne sarkaar par parsparik dayitvon ke saath do sandhiyon ko nirdhaarit kiya
 In the first treaty, the people surrendered themselves to the authority of the general public
 is praadhikaar ko kanoon banane or use lagu karne kii shakti praapt he
 The second treaty has limitations on authority, that is, the nation has no power to jeopardize the basic rights of humans
 jahaan tak loke kaa sambandh tha, manushya ke buniyadi adhikaar hai jivan, swatantraaa or sampatti kaa sangrakshan
 iske alaava, unki manyata thi ki raashtra ko naagarik or prakritik kaanoonon kii seemaa ke bheetar kaam karnaa hoga
 Both Hobbes and Locke laid down a system in which peaceful coexistence between humans could be ensured through social agreement or contract
 unka maananaa tha ki naagarik samaaj ek aisa samudaay he, jo naagarik jivan kaa rakh-rakhaav karata he, aisa raashtra jahaan naagarik gun or adhikaar prakritik kaanoonon se praapt kiye gaye hon
 haalanki, unhone yah nahin mana ki sabhy samaaj raashtra ke liye ek alag kshetra he
 Rather, he underscored the co-existence of nation and civil society
 hobs or loke ke vyavasthit drushtikon kaaphi had tak us yug ke anubhavon se prabhavit the
 His attempt to explain human nature, natural law, social contracts and government challenged the divine right doctrine
 daivi adhikaar ke vipareet, hobs or loke kaa daawa tha ki manushya apni raajnneetik vyavastha pariklpit kar sakate hai
 This idea had a great impact on the thinkers of the Enlightenment era
 prabud vichaarkon ne tark diya ki manushya tarksangat hai or apane bhagya ko sanvaar sakate hai
 Therefore, there is no need for an absolute authority to control them
 jin-jex rousiyu or imanual kaant, donon ne tark diya ki log shantipriy hai or yuddh nirankush shashan kii dein he 
 jaha tak kaant kaa sambandh he, yah pranali ekal swaarth ke varchasv or bahumat ke atyaachaar ke prati pratiraksha ke liye prabhavi he 
 GWF Hegel completely changed the meaning of civil society, which gave rise to his modern liberal interpretation as a market society rather than a modern civil nation institution
 apane purvavartiyon ke vipareet, svachhndathawad ke is pramukh vichaarak ne naagarik samaaj ko ek alag kshetra, ek "aavashyaktaaon kii pranali" mana, jo vyaktigat hiton or nijee sampatti kii santushti ke liye khadaa he
 Hegel believed that civilized society had emerged during a particular period of capitalism and had fulfilled its selfishness: personal rights and private property
 Therefore, he used the German word "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" to denote "civil society" - an area regulated by the Civil Code
 hegel ke liye, naagarik samaaj virodhabhasi balon dwaara pramanit hota he
 Being within the purview of capitalist interests, it is prone to conflicts and inequalities
 isliye, samaaj main naitik vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye rajya kii satat nigaraanee aavashyak he
 Hegel considered the state to be the highest form of moral life
 Therefore, the political nation has the ability and authority to rectify the faults of civil society
 alexis di toqueville ne nirankush france or loktantric america kii tulana karne ke baad, raashtra ke udaar vyaktvaad or kendrikaran, donon ke pratisantulan ke rup main naagarik or raajnneetik sanghon kii pranali par jor dete hue hegel kii baat ko amaanya siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, Hegel's notion of social power was generally imitated by Torquayville, which made a distinction between political society and civil society

 marks ke liye, naagarik samaaj 'neenv' thi jahaan utpaadak bal or saamaajik sambandh ghatit ho rahe the, jabaki raajnneetik samaaj ek 'bahari dhaancha' tha
 While agreeing strongly between capitalism and civil society, Marx believed that civil society represents the interests of the bourgeoisie
 Therefore, as an external structure, the nation also represents the interests of the dominant class; Under capitalism, it maintains the hegemony of the bourgeoisie
 isliye, marks ne hegel dwaara prastut raashtra kii sakaaratmak bhoomika ko asweekrut kiya
 Marx argued that the nation cannot solve a neutral problem
 Rather, he portrayed the nation as a defender of the interests of the bourgeoisie
 He considered the nation and civil society as the executive hands of the bourgeoisie; Therefore, both should be dispensed
 sabhy samaaj ke bare main is nakaaratmak drushtikon ko antonio gramski ne sudhara 
 kisi had tak marks kii baat se hatate hue, gramski ne naagarik samaaj ko raashtra ke saamaajik-aarthik aadhaar se sanlagn nahin mana
 balki, gramski ne raajnneetik dhaanche ko naagarik samaaj main avasthit paaya
 He underlined the important role of civil society as a contributor to the cultural and ideological capital required for the existence of the hegemony of capitalism
 Rather than presenting it as a problem, Gramsci saw civil society as a problem solver, just as in previous Marxist concepts
 Agreeing with Gramsci, the New Left determined civil society to play an important role in defending people against the nation and the market, and in maintaining a democratic resolve to influence the nation
 At the same time, neo-liberal thinkers considered the site of struggle to remove communist and authoritarian rule
 Thus, the term civil society has an important place in the political discourse of neo-leftists and neo-liberals
 sabhy samaaj ko samajhane kii aadhunikottar paddati prathamtah purv soviet block purvi europea deshon main raajnneetik virodh dwaara 1980 ke dashak main viksit hui
 Since that time, the practice of using the idea of civil society rather than political society stems within the political arena
 However, with the emergence of ngos and new social movements on a global scale in the 1990s, civil society as a third sector became an important area of strategic action for the creation of 'an alternative social and world order'
 iske baad, naagarik samaaj ke vichaar kaa aadhunikottar prayog, paribhaashaon kii bharmaar ke alaava-do pramukh bhaagon main bant gaya: raajnneetik samaaj ke rup main or tritiy kshetra ke rup main
 The 1990s Washington consensus also included conditional loans by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to debt-ridden developed countries, forcing states to retreat in poorer countries
 This in turn led to practical changes for civil society that influenced theoretical debate
 shuruuaat main nai pratibandhta ne raashtra ke seva praavdhaan or saamaajik dekh-rekh ko pratisthapit karte hue 'naagarik samaaj' par rambaan ke rup main or bhi adhik jor daalaa, hulm or edward ne suzav diya he ki ab ise 'jaadu kii goli' ke rup main dekha jane laga he
 Some developing political scientists cautioned that this approach posed new threats
 udhaaharan ke liye, 'let as get civil socity street' main whites ne tark diya ki aksar naagarik samaaj ke raajnneetikaran or sambhavit vibhaajankaree prakruti ko kuch niti nirmaataaon dwaara andekha kiya ja rahaa he
 By the end of the 1990s, civil society came to be seen as a panacea between the rise of the anti-globalization movement and the change in democracy of many countries, with more and more demands from civil society to justify its legitimacy and democratic credentials
 Started being This paved the way for the formation of a high-level panel on civil society by the United Nations
 Post-modern civil society theory has now largely returned to a neutral stance, but there are marked differences between the study of this fact in affluent societies and the writings on civil society in developing nations
 tathaapi, donon kshetron main naagarik samaaj, aksar raashtra ke sambandh main ek vikalp kii jagah santulan or poorak ke rup main dekha jaataa he, yaa jaisaa ki whites ne apane 1996 ke lekh main kaha, 'raashtra ko naagarik samaaj kii purv shart ke rup main dekha jaataa he' The literature on the relationship between democratic society and political society has its roots in early liberal writings such as Alexis de Torquayville
 lekin ve vishisht rup se gabrial almond tathaa sidni varba jaise 20veen sadi ke siddhantkaron dwaara viksit kii gai, jinhone loktantric vyavastha main raajnneetik samskruti kii bhoomika ko mahatvapurn mana
 He argued that the political elements of many voluntary organizations create better awareness and more knowledgeable citizens, who consequently choose to vote better, participate in politics and make government more accountable
 in sanghathanon kii vidhiyon ko aksar sookshm samvidhan mana jaataa he kyonki ve pratibhaagiyon ko loktantric nirnay lene kii aupchaariktaaon ke prati abhyast banaate hai
 Recently, Robert D
 Putnam has argued that non-political organizations in civil society are also important for democracy
 yah isliye ki ve saamaajik puunji, vishwaas, saajha mulyon kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo rajnatik kshetra main antarit kiye jate hai or samaaj tathaa usamen nihit hiton kii paraspar sanyojaktaa kii samaj suvidhajanak banaate hue samaaj ko ek saath baandhe rakhane main madad karte hai
 However, others have sought to know what a truly democratic civilized society is like
 kuch logon ne note kiya he ki sabhy samaaj ke abhinaytaon ne ab apni bina kisi ke pratyaksh chayan yaa niyukti ke hi, ullekhneey maatra main raajnneetik shakti hasil kii he
 Partha Chatterjee has argued that, in most parts of the world, "civilized society is demographically limited
 " jai sen ke anusaar sabhy samaaj vaishvik vishisht varg dwaara apane swaarth ke liye sanchalit ek nav-aupniveshik pariyojna he
 Finally, other scholars state that, as the concept of civilized society is closely linked to democracy and representation, it must in turn be linked to the idea of nationalism and nationalism
 sarkaron ne vibhinn najareeyon ko pradarshit kiya he or naagarik samaaj va sanghathanon tathaa unki rachana karne vaale kii ore nirdeshit vividh nitiyon ko lagu kiya he
 Some authoritarian governments have restricted most political and social rights activist organizations and civilian life exists only for groups that do not present a challenge to the established system
 In the United States, the government has campaigned to discredit and disband leading organizations and important social movements with the stated purpose of "protection of national security, prevention of violence, and maintenance of existing social and political systems"
 udhaaharan ke liye, COINTELPRO ek dashak lanbaa efabiai kaarykram tha jisane mahila andolan, naagarik adhikaar andolan, mul america andolan or yuddh-virdohi andolanon main agrani sanghathanon or vyaktiyon ke khilaaf manovaigyanik yuddh, anuchit qaid, avaidh hinsa or hatya tathaa anya takneekon kaa upyog kiya
 Current critics and activists often apply the term civil society to areas of social life in need of protection against globalization, and sources of resistance to them, as it appears to work beyond and across borders
 tathaapi, vibhinn paribhaashaon ke adheen, naagarik samaaj main shaamil or vaishvikaran kaa samarthan karne vaale vyavsaay or sansthaaon dwaara vittposhit tathaa nirdeshit yah prayog vivaadaaspad he
 Following the collapse of the communist system, the rapid development of civil society globally was part of the neo-liberal strategies associated with the Washington Consensus
 kuch aise adhyayan bhi prakashit kiye gaye hai, jo antarrashtriya sahaayta pranali ke prabhaav or vaicharik shakti ke sambandh main is shabd ke upyog se sambandhit ansulajhe muddon se vyavhaar karte hai
 
 On the other hand, others see globalization as a social phenomenon expanding beyond the circle of ancient liberal values, which inevitably results in a larger role for civil society at the cost of national institutions derived from politics

 The term "constitutional economics" was used by the American economist — James M
 Buchanan — as the name of a new academic sub-topic that led him to develop the contractual and constitutional underpinnings for his "economic and political decision-making theory" in 1986
 "nobel Prize for Economic Sciences
 Buchanan rejected "any biological concept that considers the nation's conscience superior to that of its member states"

 The Russian School of Constitutional Economics was created in the early twenty-first century with the idea that constitutional economics, legislatively especially in the budget process, permits economics and constitutional analysis, which will help to overcome arbitrariness in economic and financial decision making
 And the gateway to include civil society in the budget process will open
 The Russian model is based on the understanding that the economic, social and political rights conferred by the constitution need to be practically and narrow the gap between annual budget legislation and government-administered administrative policies
 sanvaidhanik arthshaastra aise muddon par uchit rashtriya dhan vitaran ke rup main adhyayan karata he
 It also includes the government's spending on the judiciary, which in most transitional and developing countries is fully controlled by the executive
 kaaryakarini dwaara nyaaypalika par gambhir vittiya nirbharta utpann karne ke kaaran vah adhikaron ke siddhant "check or shesh" ko kshati pahunchaati he
 It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the nation and the private
 The corruption of the judiciary by the nation makes it almost impossible for any business to optimally facilitate the growth and development of the national market economy

 Constitutional economics standards, when used during the planning of the annual budget as well as its transparency towards society, are primarily important guidelines for the implementation of the legal rule

 inamen se do mukhya hai - purvi rup or pashchimi rup
 In terms of literary usage, the eastern form is considered the standard

 In these two main forms of Assamese, sound, grammar and vocabulary find differences from these three views
