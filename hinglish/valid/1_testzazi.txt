arya samaajiyon ne sabase bada kaary jati vyavastha ko todane or sabhi hinduon main samanta kaa bhav jaagrit karne kaa kiya
 The way India was made an economic colony of the British government and later a political colony, it was natural for Indians to react sharply against it
 chunki bharat dhire-dhire pashchimi vichaaron kii ore badhane laga tha, atah pratikriya saamaajik kshetra se aana swaabhaavik kaary thi
 This reaction came in the form of social reform movements that arose in the 19th century
 aise hi samaaj sudhaar andolanon main aryasamaj kaa naam aata he
 The Arya Samaj did its work by internal reforms in the society itself, to throw off foreign gambling
 isane aadhunik bharat main prarambh hue purnajagaran ko nai disha di
 At the same time, it inspired Indians to adopt Indianism, to accept ancient culture as fundamental, to end Western influence with the slogan of Pure Indianism i
e
 'return to the Vedas' and unite all Indians
 19veen shatabdi main bharat main samaaj sudhaar ke andolanon main aryasamaj agrani tha
 Aryasamaj took the first step in the salvation of Harijans, he first understood the need for education of girls
 varna vyavastha ko janmagat na maanakar karmgat siddh karne kaa sehara uske sir he | jatibhed bhav or khanpan ke chhotchhaat or chauke-chuulhe kii baadhaon ko mitaane kaa gaurav usee ko praapt he
 He dug up thousands of incest graves in the name of superstition and religion
 1875 main sthapana ke sheeghra baad hi isaki prasiddhi tatkaaleen samaaj vichaarkon, aacharyon, samaaj sudhaarkon aadi ko prabhavit karne main safal hui, or kuch varshon baad hi aryasamaj kii sampurna bharat ke pramukh shaharon main shakhayein sthapit ho gayi
 Swamiji's scholarly lectures and miraculous personality turned the youth towards Aryasamaj
 anya samakaleen saamaajik dharmik andolanon kii apeksha aryasamaj sahi artha main adhik rashtravaadi tha
 It was a movement with a more aggressive nature against westernization flourishing in India
 arya samaaj ne apni sthapana se hi saamaajik kuritiyon ke viruddh aandolan kaa shankhanaad kiya, jaise- jativaadee jadmulak samaaj ko todna, mahilaon ke liye samaanadhikaar, balvivaah kaa unmoolan, vidhwaa vivaah kaa samarthan, nimna jatiyon ko saamaajik adhikaar praapt hona aadi
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati made the above social renaissance the main foundation behind the establishment of Arya Samaj
 unka vishwaas tha ki naveen prabud bharat main, navjagrit hote samaaj main, naye bharat kaa nirmaan karnaa he to samaaj ko bandhanmukt karnaa pratham kaary hona chahie
 Despite being a Brahmin himself, Swamiji represented the rebellion of the authority of Brahmins and sharply condemned religious superstitions and rituals
 alpakaal main hi ve bharat ke samaaj sudhaar ke kshetra main naveen gyaan-jyoti ke rup main udayiman hue
 In this he found that the Indian youth is insisting on western imitation
 atah unhonen paashchaatya samskruti par shaktishaalee prahaar kiya or bhartiya gaurav ko sadaiv ooncha kiya
 In general, Swamiji criticized regional sects and other religions as well as highlighting the faults operating in Indian society and Hinduism
 purohitwaad par karaara prahaar karte hue swamiji ne mana tha ki swaarthon or agyani purohiton ne puraanon jaise grantho kaa sahaara lekar hindu dharm kaa bhrasht kiya he
 Swami ji was strongly opposed to idolatry, ritualism, mythology, systemicism as a reformer
 iske liye unhone vedon kaa sahaara lekar vibhinn drushtaant kiye
 With this, he made a wonderful attempt to animate the dormant Indian public
 swami ji ne hinduon ko hin, patit or kaayar hone ke bhav se mukt kiya or unamem utkar aatmavishvaas jaagrit kiya
 Consequently, the society could revolt against the mental slavery of the West with strong confidence and determination
 inhi krantikari vichaaron ke kaaran velentine shirol ne swamiji ko 'indian arnest' kaha
 See, Dayanand Anglo Vedic School, Gurukul Kangri University swami dayanand ke mulmantra tha ki janata kaa vikaas or pragati sunishchit karne or unke astitv kii raksha karne kaa sarvottam saadhan shiksha he
 Aryasamaj worked by tying this mantra in a knot
 aryasamaj ne is tathy ko aatmsaat kar liya tha ki shiksha kii jaden rashtriya bhaavana or parampara main gahari jami honi chaiye
 We inherit an ancient and noble tradition
 hamaari shiksha main bhartiya nitishastra or darshan ko sarvopari sthaan praapt hoga
 Aryasamaj played a leading role in the field of education by establishing Gurukul and DAV colleges in the field of education
 strishiksha main aryasamaj kaa ullekhneey yogadan rahaa
 By the beginning of 1885, the Amritsar branch of Aryasamaj had announced the establishment of two women's schools and a third was proposed at Katra Dula
 1880 ke dauraan lahore aryasamaj mahila shiksha ke kshetra main agrani bana hua tha
 In 1889, Ferozepur Arya Samaj established a girls' school
 arya samaaj se jude log bharat kii swatantrata ke saath-saath bharat kii samskruti, bhashaa, dharm, shiksha aadi ke kshetra main sakriy rup se jude rahe
 Swami Dayanand's mother tongue was Gujarati and he had a good knowledge of Sanskrit, but on the advice of Keshav Chandra Sen, he composed Satyarth Prakash in Hindi
 dayanand ne satyarth prakaash jaisaa krantikari granth hindi main rachakar hindi ko ek pratishtha di
 Aryasamaj called Hindi as 'aryabhasha' and said that knowledge of it is necessary for all Aryasamajis
 dayanand ji vedon kaa kii vyakhya sanskrit ke saath-saath hindi main bhi kii
 Swami Shraddhanand also took the loss and published many letters and magazines in Hindi written in Devanagari script whereas his publication was earlier in Urdu
 aryasamaj hindi ke samvardhan ke maidan main agragami bana
 Hindi language was given priority in hundreds of Gurukuls, DAV schools and colleges and for this work new syllabus books were created through Hindi language at places like Gurukul Kangri and Lahore etc
 whose subjects were science, mathematics, sociology, history etc
 
 yah ek alag hi kism kaa hindi bhashaa main pareekshan tha jiske vaanchhneeya parinaam nikle
 In abroad, Bhavani Dayal Sanyasi, Bhai Parmanand, Ganga Prasad Upadhyay, Dr
 Chiranjeev Bhardwaj, Mehta Jaimini, Acharya Ramdev, Pandit Chamupati etc
 propagated the Hindi language among the diaspora so that they could stay away from their homeland, its culture, its ideology He was not only connected but also made known to his foreign-born descendants
 aryasamaj dwaara na keval punjab main hindi bhashaa kaa prachaar kiya gaya apitu sudur dakshin bharat main, assam, burma aadi tak hindi ko pahunchaaya gaya
 Efforts were also made by Swami Shraddhanand to use simple Hindi language in place of difficult language in the court
 arya samaaj kii hindi patrakarita ne desh ko rashtriya samskruti, dharmachintan, swadeshi kaa paath padhaayaa
 Through the Aryasamaj, there was an unprecedented growth of literature, both enlightening and romantic
 swami dayanand patrakarita dwaara dharm prachaar vyapak rup se karnaa chaahate the
 He himself could not get out any letter, but encouraged the Arya Samajis to take out magazines and magazines
 arya samaaj kii vibhinn sansthaaon dwaara prasaarit hone vaali patr-patrikaon main ‘pavamaan’, ‘aatm shuddhi path’, ‘vaidic garjana’, ‘arya sankalp’, ‘vaidic ravi’, ‘vishvajyoti’, ‘satyarth saurabh’, ‘dayanand sandesh’, ‘maharishi dayanand smriti prakaash’, ‘tapobhumi’, ‘nutan nishkaam patrika’, ‘arya prerana’, ‘arya sansar’, ‘sudhaarak’, ‘tankaara samachar’, ‘agnidoot’, ‘arya sevak’, ‘bharatoday’, ‘arya musafir’, ‘arya sandesh’, ‘arya maryaada’, ‘arya jagat’, ‘arya mitra’, ‘arya pratinidhi’, ‘arya maartand’, ‘arya jivan’, ‘paropkaaree’, ‘samvarddhini’ aadi masik, pakshik va vaarshik patrikaayen prakashit ho rahi hai jisase hindi patrakarita ko navy alok mil rahaa he
 Hindi was the language of propagation of Aryasamaj
 arya samaaj ne hindi patrakarita ke unnayan main aitihaasik bhoomika nibhaai

 nagabhatta do shaskaon kaa naam tha: Corporate social responsibility is the self-control adopted by commercial and industrial companies under which they operate according to a business model that is compatible with law, ethical standards, and international practice
 iske antargat company dwaara kuch aise kaary kiye jate hai jo paryaavaran, aam janata, upabhokta, karmchaaree, tathaa anshadhariyon par sakaaratmak prabhaav daale
 Corporate social responsibility is a form of corporate self-regulation integrated into a business model
 ek swa niamak tantra he jiske tahat ek vyapaar par nazar rakhata he or kanoon, naitik maanakon or rashtriya yaa antarrashtriya mandandon kii bhaavana ke saath apni sakriy anupaalan sunishchit karata he ke rup main siesaar niti kaary karata he
 The objective is to reduce business and legal risks by taking responsibility for corporate actions to increase long-term profits and shareholder confidence through positive public relations and high ethical standards
 siesaar ranneetiyon paryaavaran or upabhoktaaon, karmchaariyon, niveshkon, samudaayon, or anya logon sahit hitdharakon par sakaaratmak prabhaav banane ke liye company protsaahit karte hai
 Corporations work with a CSR perspective to increase long-term profits
 siesaar ek sanghathan ke mishan sahaayta ke rup main acchhee tarah se kya company apane upabhoktaaon ke liye pratinidhitiv karne ke liye ek guide ke rup main seva karne ke liye sheershak he
 The term "corporate social responsibility" became popular in the 1960s and used indiscriminately by many, legal and moral responsibility remains a term to cover more narrowly imposed
 bijness shabdkosh "ke rup main samudaay or paryaavaran main ise sanchalit prati jimmedaari kii company kii bhaavana siesaar ko paribhaashit karata he
 By earning substantial returns on this Citizenship Express programs and working resources through their waste and pollution reduction processes, the company makes educational and social contributions
 adhikansh upabhoktaaon ko is baat se sahamat hai ki jab vyapaar ke lakshyon ko praapt karne, companiyon ke ek hi samay main siesaar karnaa chahie
 == Customer point of view == Most of the customers agree that the company will do CSR only for the purpose of commercial purpose
 Most consumers believe that a positive response will be received for companies making donations
 baryaach graahakanna watate kii dengichya companyana sakaaratmak pratisaad denyaat yeil

 Somerville, look at it as a customer, trusting and selling your business, j Deengichya will be able to spend more
 However, environmental efforts are receiving negative views of consumers believing that this will have an impact on customer service

 Clients try to get negative thoughts, because they are considered to be the result of severe customer
 The local product of Zari Biswas is a vikryasathi allegiance
 Not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers
 sarv siesaar upkram graahakanna aakarshak naahit
 Initially, CSR emphasized the official behavior of individual firms
 baad main, yah aapurtikarta vyavhaar or upyog karata he jo karne ke liye utpaadon daal rahe the shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya he or kaise ve ke baad ve mulya kho kaa nipataara kiya gaya
 Irresponsible behavior reflected both the misconduct at the firm, but also at its corporate clients
 aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan siesaar sandarbh vichaar karne ke liye vistaar kiya
 Companies need to include social responsibility in their review of component quality
 siesaar ke ek sanghathan ke maanav sansaadhan, vyavsaay vikaas yaa jansampark vibhaag ke bheetar aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he, yaa ek alag ikai ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari yaa nideshak mandal ke liye reporting ho saktaa he
 The purpose of a corporation is to maximize the returns that constitutes socially responsible behavior to its shareholders and to the court within which it operates
 jabaki kuch siesaar samarthakon kaa daawa he ki companiyon ko siesaar abhyaas, vishesh rup se vikasshil deshon main kam shramikon or samudaayon, aalochakon kaa daawa he ki siesaar khud apratyaashit parinaamon ke saath sthaneey samudaayon par baahar mulyon lagaataa kaa phayda uthaane kii sambhaavna he
 Better government regulation and enforcement, rather than voluntary measures that drive public decision-making and allocation of resources to private bodies, are an alternative to CSR
 haalanki, aalochakon kaa daawa he ki prabhavi siesaar svaichhik anivaary saamaajik jimmedaari ke kaaryakramon viniyamit rup se sarkaar logon kii apni yojanaon or praathamiktaaon ke saath hastkshep sansadhano ke aavanton ko vikrut, or gaiyr jimmedaar nirnyon kii sambhaavna bad jaati hona chahie
 Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies to distract the public from the ethical questions arising from their main functions
 unka tark he ki pratishtha laabh he ki siesaar companiyon praapt drushtikon ke paakhand kaa pradarshan
 Another concern is that sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other harmful business practices
 is tarah ke tambaakoo, sharaab yaa ladaai ke saamaan companiyon ke rup main udyogon ke utpaadon he ki apane upabhoktaaon or / yaa paryaavaran ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Such companies can engage in the same philanthropic activities as those in other industries
 is dwandv siesaar ke sambandh main aisi companiyon ke akalan pechida ho
 Corporate people have little or no discretion or care or sympathy, it is logical that they are not motivated by any notion of social responsibility and commitment to employees or to the wider public
 top vah hathiyaar he jo kisi baari gole ko bahut dur tak prakshipt kar sakati he
 They often fire the shells with the force of gaseous pressure produced by gunpowder or an explosive
 aadhunik yug main top kaa prayog saamanyat: nahin hota he
 Mortar, howitzer etc
 are used instead
 topein apni kshamta, paraas, chalaniyata, daagne kii gati, daagne kaa kone evam daagne kii shakti aadi ke aadhaar par anek prakaar kii hotin hai
 There is definite evidence of the use of cannon in Europe from 1313 AD
 bharat main babar ne panipat kii ladaai main topon kaa pehle-pehle prayog kiya
 The first cannons were made of bronze and were molded
 parantu aisi topein paryaapt pusht nahin hoti thim
 They used to burst by putting more ammo in them
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye unke upar lohe ke challe tapt karke khub kasakar chadha die jate the
 When frost, such rings shrink and hold the inner cord very firmly, just as the wheel mounted on top of the bullock cart is pressed
 adhik pushtataa ke liye challe chadhaane ke pehle naal par lambaai ke anudish bhi lohe kii chaden ek duusari se sataakar rakh di jaati thim
 a famous cannon of the time is Mons Meg, which is now placed on the fortress of Edinburgh to adorn
 iske baad lagbhag 200 varshon tak top banane main koi vishesh unnati nahin hui
 In this era, the cluster of drains was smooth
 parantu lagbhag san 1520 main germany ke ek top banaanevaale ne sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanche bananaa aarambh kiya
 This cannon consisted of longitudinal "shells" instead of circular shells
 sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanchon ke kaaran prakshipt pind veg se naachne lagata he
 Thus the dancing object deviates much less from resistance to air and consequently falls more truthfully at the target

 On the other hand, small cannon guns are light and there is not much velocity in the projectile coming out of them, but they have the quality that the projectile falls very high up and down and hence it can kill the enemy hiding behind the wall, hill etc
 inhen morter kehete hai
 a cannon of mid-size is called a howitzer
 jaise-jaise topon ke banane main unnati hui vaise-vaise mortaron or houvitzron ke banane main bhi unnati hui
 In almost all countries, there was an advance in the manufacture of guns in the same way, because there was equal competition
 jab koi ek desh aadhik baari, adhik shaktishaalee yaa adhik furti se gola daagnevaali top banaata to baat bahut dinon tak chhipi na rahati or pratidwandvi deshon kii cheshtaa hoti ki usase bhi acchhee top banaai jaay
 In 1898, the French made a cannon that was to guide the guns that were made after that
 usase nikle prakshipt kaa veg adhik tha; uskaa aropan saraahneey tha; daagne par purnataya sthir rahata tha, kyonki aropan main aise daine lage the jo bhoomi main dhansakar top ko kisi dish main hilne na dete the
 All cannons retreat when fired
 is dhakke ke veg ko ghataane ke liye dravon kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Its projections were made of thin walls
 inamen se prayek kii tol lagbhag 12 pound thi or usamen lagbhag saadhe teen pound ucch visphoti barood rahati thi
 There was also a cap containing special chemicals in the projectile, which caused the projectile to explode upon reaching the target and the pieces used to injure the enemy far and wide
 yah diwaar ke peeche chhipe sainikon ko bhi maar sakati he
 In the First World War, the Germans built a cannon called 'big Bertha', from which they started shelling 75 miles from Paris
 is top main koi nayaa siddhant nahin tha
 The cannon was only sufficiently large and athletic
 parantu hawaii jahaajon tathaa anya naveen yantron ke avishkaar se aisi topein ab luptpraaya ho gai hai
 Implantation - Initially, cannons were often mounted on any strong platform or outpost, but gradually people began to need that the cannons should be mounted on strong trains, in which they were easily transported from one place to another
 Go and usually get ready to fire immediately
 gaadi ke peeche bhoomi par ghistanevaali punch ke samaan bhaag bhi rahata tha, jisamen dhakke se gaadi peeche na bhaage
 Cannon carts that could be pulled easily were started from 1680

 The same work started to be taken from the commanders
 gaadiyaan bhi ispaat kii banane lageen
 Cannons were not built until 1914 to shoot down aircraft
 pehle bahut choti topein bani, phir 13 pound ke prakshipt maaranevaali topein banane lageen, jo teen ton kii motor lariyon par aropit rahati thim
 Now even heavier cannons than these are already mounted on hardened trolleys or tanks made of steel
 tanks bhedi topon ko bahut shaktishaalee hona padataa he
 Tanks are carts made of thick sheets of steel
 inke bheetar baitha yoddha tanks par ladi top se shatru ko martha rahata he or swayan bahut kuch surakshit rahata he
 The 1941 anti-tank guns fired 17-pound shells

 In this tank, like the 60 Mm of USA and Laird tanks of Germany, 105 mm
 Along with the k Gun, machine guns and anti-aircraft guns are also fitted
 yantrik vaahan - san 1909 main england ke yudhkaryaalay ne 7,500 rupye kaa paritoshik aise tractor ke liye ghoshit kiya jo aath ton ke boj ko lekar 200 mile bina eendhan yaa upasnehak liye chal sake
 Since then artillery mechanical vehicles were born
 ab aisi gaadiyaan uplabdh hai jo bina sadak ke hi khet aadi main sugamawa se chal sakati hai
 Their wheels are fastened with chains
 iske kaaran ye gaadiyaan oobad-khabad bhoomi par chal sakati hai
 The velocity of these trains is 30–35 miles per hour, but the chain strap deteriorates after about one and a half thousand miles

 They had engines of about 100 horsepower and could carry guns of up to nine ten tonne weight
 navik top - torpeado ke avishkaar ke pehle topein hi jahaajon ke mukhya aayudh hoti thim
 Now the cannon, torpedo and airplane are the three main armaments
 18veen shatabdi main 2,000 ton ke boj lad sakanevaale jahaajon main 100 topein lagi rahati thim
 Half of these left heavy shells, and the remaining lighter shells; But in modern times the number of cannons and the weight of the balls have been reduced and the velocity of the balls has been increased
 udhaahrant: san 1915 main bane revange naamak drednot jati ke jahaajon main aath topein 15 inch bhitari vyas kii peeche lagi thim
 Four such guns were in the front and eight in the side
 inke atirikt 12 choti topein chah inch kii thim
 Perceptions of cannons, howitzers and mortars vary
 mukhya antar sanchhidr ke vyas or is vyas tathaa lambaai ke anupaat main rahata he
 The more ammo is to be filled in the device, the more athletic the walls of the device have to be made
 isiilie top usee naap ke sanchhidravale houvitzar se baari hoti he
 Now, due to the availability of high-grade steel, the production of athletic cannons is not as difficult as before, but now the power of gunpowder has also increased
 ab bhi topon kii naalen thandi naalon par tapt ore kase khol chadhaakar banaai jaati hai, yaa unpar ispaat kaa tapt taar kasakar lapeta jaataa he or is taar ke upar ek bahari naal tapt karke chadha di jaati he
 The inner placenta is made by knocking the gullies in overheated steel and beating the placenta to the proper shape
 iske badale veg se ghurnan karte hue saanche main bhi kuch naalen dhaali jaati hai
 In these, the fluid falls on the walls of the steel with great speed
 yah vidhi keval choti topon ke liye prayukt hoti he
 After the placenta is formed, it is carefully heated and cooled, in which water is added to it and then its water is slightly removed, in which there is no fear of breaking it by stumbling
 tapt or thanda karne ke kaam main bahudhaa do saptaah tak samay lag saktaa he, kyonki aadhunik naal 60 foot tak lambii or 60 ton tak baari hoti he
 Full details of all the work are written, in which to gain from experience in future
 lohe se tukade kaat katkar uski jaanch baar-baar hoti rahati he
 In the end, they are mounted on the machine and lathe
 phir sanchhidr main lambey sarpil kaate jate hai
 This action is called "rifling", it takes two to three weeks to rifle a large cannon
 sab aadhunik topon main peeche kii ore se barood bhari jaati he
 Therefore there is such a way that the placenta can be closed
 isaki do vidhiyaan hai-yaa to dhakkan main khandit pench rahata he, jise naal main daalkar thodaa sa ghumaane par dhakkan kas jaataa he athwa dhakkan ek bagal se khiskkar apane sthaan par aa jaataa he or naal ko band kar detaa he
 For the purpose that the gases produced by burning of ammo from the joint do not drain, either the ammo and ammunition remains locked in the cartridge or there is a soft pad near the pact, which settles tightly with the pressure of the gases
 daagne kii kriya yaa to bijli se hoti he yaa ek "ghoda" vishesh jvalansheel topi ko thonkta he 
 All these tips in the back are connected by backlash

 a surface made for the purpose of moving vehicles or laying on the surface of a path made for walking is called Kuttim
 purvakaal main bajri, farshi pathar or grenite seton kaa bahudhaa prayog hota tha
 But now they have been replaced mostly by asphalt and concrete
 kisi sadak kaa kaam keval yahi nahin he ki vah gaadiyaan chalaane ke liye paryaapt pusht ho, balki vah gadiyon ke bhaar or mausam ke prabhaav se honevaali tut foot bhi sahe
 The local soil may not have the capability to fulfill all these objectives properly, so it is of great importance to arrange a suitable surface in terms of structure
 sanrachanaatmak drushtikon se upyukt hone ke atirikt sadak kii sataha main sarvaadhik apekshit gun ye hai : There are a variety of surfaces ranging from a poor grade of stabilized clay, to an excellent grade of cement and asphalt concrete
 inke bich bajri kii, panikutau macadam or halake bitumeni aavaranwali sadaken hoti hai
 Factors like intensity and type of traffic, importance of road and availability of funds should be taken into consideration in choosing which type of surface would be suitable for a road
 aarambh main soch vichaarkar vyay kiya hua dhan baad main ghati hui anurakshan laagat ke rup main bhalee bhanti vasuul ho saktaa he
 Preventive measures are better than treatment
 yah sadak ke liye upyukt sataha chunane ke kshetra main bhi bhalee bhanti lagu hota he
 Stabilized soil is prepared by treating it with a chemical by adding another type of soil, or lime, cement brought from outside into the local soil
 iske falswaroop ek sthir mishran praapt hota he
 Its purpose is to improve soil strength
 kintu is prakaar praapt samarthy bahudhaa baari boj vahan karne ke liye aparyaapt hoti he
 Therefore, stabilized soil is recommended only for villages, or for light traffic roads
 bajri daalkar kachi sadak sudhaarna or use ausat darje ke yatayaat ke yogya bananaa, kam kharch kaa ek tarika he
 It uses gravel or murm, which is laid three to six inches thick on the road surface
 aisa prati varsh, athwa kuch adhik kalantar se kiya jaataa he
 By doing this, a fairly stable surface is formed
 pani kuti macadam bharat main sadakon kii paramparaagat sataha rahi he
 It consists of two or more layers, well-grounded of broken stone or pebble
 nichali tah se lagbhag chah chah inch ke pathar, yaa kankad, yaa shinch moti iten saavdhaneepurvak haath se jamaa di jaati hai
 The top is made of stone or pebble ballast measuring 2 inches from the bottom
 rikt sthaan muram, bajri, yaa anya aise hi padaarth se bhar die jate he; tadnantar pehle sukhi or phir pani daalkar kutai kii jaati he
 Panikuti macadam has a good surface if there is light and slow traffic, but it is not very good for fast trains with windy wheels
 jaise jaise sadakon par tej chaal kaa yatayaat badhata gaya, chalane ke liye dhularahit, chikani sataha vaali sadakon kii aavashyaktaa adhikadhik anubhav hui
 Bitumen surfaces are one solution to this problem
 yatayaat ke anuroop ye vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai
 All have simple single or double-covering surfaces
 ikhare aavaranwali sataha, jhaadkar bhalee bhanti saaf kii hui sukhi panikuti macadam par bitumen chhidakkar, usapar pathar kaa jira failaakar, roller se kootakar taiyaar kii jaati he
 In this way, the bitumen climbs upward and binds the cumin well
 pehle kii kaali sataha par baad ke aavaran bhi isi prakaar chadaaye jate hai
 Bitumeni gach is prepared by spreading molten bitumen over crushed ballast on the road
 is prakaar bitumen gitti ke antaraalon main ghus jaataa he
 Although such surfaces can carry from average to heavy traffic, one inherent drawback of these is that they do not have the same bitumen dispersion
 yadi sadak par failaane or kootane ke pehle hi pathar kaa jira or bitumen paraspar mila liye jaaen, to yah dosha dur ho saktaa he
 Thus, pre-mixing provides a good surface for use
 bharat main sadakon ke lambey lambey bhaag isi prakaar taiyaar hue hai
 If stone cumin and vitumen are mixed with sand and very fine grafts in proper proportions, the mixture is called a compact mixture or 'asphalt' concrete
 damri kancreet se utkrishtatam koti kii bitumeni sataha taiyaar hoti he, jo baari yatayaat main bhi 20-25 varsh tak koi ksht nahin detii
 This surface is expensive, so it can be justified in heavy traffic roads or in big cities only
 upar varnit sabhi prakaar kii satahen namya farsho kii koti main aati hai
 The second category is of inflexible floors, covering cement concrete roads
 cement kancreet se, mukhyatya uski kathorta ore tikaaupan ke kaaran, sadak kii bahut acchhee sataha praapt hoti he
 Due to their high elasticity, cement concrete can distribute its overloading to a relatively large base, as a result it is not necessary to create a special strong base
 bhalee bhanti aakalpit or nirmit cement kancreet kii sataha baari yatayaat vahan karte hue bhi 20-25 varsh tak tik sakati he

 The content of Sociology extends from the microscopic level of face-to-face contact to the broader level of society at large
 samajashaastra, paddati or vishay vastu, donon ke maamle main ek vistrut vishay he
 Traditionally, its focus has been on social stratification, social relations, social interaction, religion, sociology | culture] and divergence, and its approach incorporates both qualitative and quantitative research techniques

 In contrast, recent decades have seen the rise of new mathematically rigorous methods, such as social network analysis
 samajashastreey tark is shabd kii utpatti kii tithi uchit samay se purv kii bataate hai
 The origins of sociology, including economic, political and cultural systems, are proto-sociological in the combined repository of Western knowledge and philosophy
 plato ke samay se hi saamaajik vishleshan kiya janaa shuru ho gaya
 It can be said that the first sociologist was the 14th century North African Arab scholar, Ibn Khaldun, whose first work to bring forward socio-scientific theories of litigation, social unity and social struggle
 shabd "sociologie " pehali baar 1780 main francisi nibandhkaar emenual joseph siyas dwaara ek aprakashit pandulipi main gadha gaya
 It was later founded in 1838 by August Comt
 isse pehle comt ne "saamaajik bhautikee" shabd kaa istemaal kiya tha, lekin baad main vah dusron dwaara apanaaya gaya, vishesh rup se belgium ke sankhyikeevid adolf kotelette
 comt ne saamaajik kshetron kii vaigyanik samaj ke madhyam se itihaas, manovigyaan or arthshaastra ko ekajute karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Writing shortly after the distraction of the French Revolution, he established that social evils can be overcome through social determinism, a philosophical approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy and a General View of Positiveism
 comt ko vishwaas tha ki ek 'pratyakshvaadi str' maanviya samaj ke kram main, dharmik atakalon or aadhyatmik charnon ke baad antim daur ko chihnit karegaa
 Although Comt is often considered the "father of sociology", the subject was formally founded by another structural pragmatic thinker Emil Durkheim, who established the first European Academic Department and later developed positivism
 tab se, saamaajik gyaanavaad, kaary paddatiyaan or poochtacha kaa dayera, mahatvapurn rup se vistrut or apsaarit hua he
 Sociology developed in the 19th century as the educational response to emerging modernism challenges, such as industrialization, urbanization, and scientific restructuring

 Durkheim, Marx and Weber are generally cited as the three major founders of sociology; His works can be attributed to the teachings of functionalism, duality theory and non-positivism respectively
 cimelor parcens ko kabhi-kabhaar chauthe "pramukh vyakti" ke rup main shiksha paathyakram main shaamil kiya jaataa he

 The systematic approach of early theorists towards sociology was to deal with this subject in the same manner as natural science
 kisi bhi saamaajik daawey yaa nishkarsh ko ek nirvivaad aadhaar pradaan karne hetu or apekshaakrit kam anubhavjanya kshetron se jaise darshan se samajashaastra ko pruthak karne ke liye anubhavvaad or vaigyanik vidhi ko mahatv dene kii talash kii gai
 This approach, called positivism, is based on the assumption that only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge and that such knowledge can only come from positive confirmation of theories, through rigorous scientific and quantitative methods
 emil durkhim saidhantik rup se aadhaarit anubhavjanya anusandhan ke ek bade samarthak the, jo sanrachanaatmak niyamon ko darshane ke liye "saamaajik tathyon" ke bich sambandho ko talash rahe the
 His position was stimulated by his dismissal of "anomie" and his interest in social findings for social reform
 aaj, durkhim kaa vidwata bharaa pratyakshvaad kaa vivaran, atishyokti or ati sarleekaran ke prati asurakshit ho saktaa he: comt hi ekmaatr aisa pramukh saamaajik vichaarak tha jisane daawa kiya ki saamaajik vibhaag bhi kuleen vigyaan ke samaan vaigyanik vishleshan ke antargat aa saktaa he, jabaki durkhim ne adhik vistaar se moulik gyanshastreey simaaon ko sweekruti di
 Reactions against positivism began when the German philosopher Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel voiced against both empiricism, which he dismissed as non-critical and determinism, and which he saw as over-mechanistic
 Karl Marx's methodology was not only derived from Hegel's provincial linguism, but also the exclusion of positivism in favor of critical analysis, seeking to complete the empirical acquisition of "facts" while erasing illusions
 uskaa maananaa rahaa ki anumaanon ko sirf likhane kii bajaay unki samiksha honi chahie
 Despite this, Marx attempted to publish a science of society based on economic determinism of historical materialism

 The first generation of German sociologists at the end of the 20th century formally introduced procedural non-positivism, with the proposition that research should focus on human culture's standards, values, symbols, and subjective perspectives on social processes
 maiks webar ne tark diya ki samajashaastra kii vyakhya halke taur par ek 'vigyaan' ke rup main kii ja sakati he, kyonki yah khaas kar jatil saamaajik ghatana ke adarsh varg athwa kaalpanik sarleekaran ke bich - kaaran-sambandhon ko pahchaanane main sakasham he
 However, as a non-positivist, in contrast to the relationships discovered by natural scientists, a person seeks relationships that are "unhistorical, immutable, or commonplace"
 Ferdinand Tönnis described the two common types of human organizations as the gameshafts and Presented to Gesellschaft
 toniz ne avadharana or saamaajik kriya kii vaastaviktaa ke kshetron ke bich ek spasht rekha khinchi: pehle vaale ke saath hamen swatahsiddh or nigamanaatmak tareeke se vyavhaar karnaa chahie, jabaki duusare se prayogsiddh or ek aagamanaatmak tareeke se

 Relatively isolated from the social academy throughout his life, Simel presented a behavioral analysis of modernity, reminiscent of Comt or Durkheim and the existential writers, who focused exclusively on the possibilities and forms for social individualism

 In Austria and later America, Alfred Schutz developed social phenomenology, which later brought about social constructionism
 usee avadhi ke dauraan francfort skool ke sadasyon ne, siddhant main - webar, frid or gramski kii antardrushti sahit marxvad ke aitihaasik bhautikwaadi tatwon ko ekikrut kar vivechanaatmak siddhant kaa vikaas kiya, yadi hameshaa naam main naa rahaa ho, tab bhi aksar gyaan ke kendriya siddhanton se dur hone ke kram main poonjivadi aadhuniktaa kii visheshta bataata he

 In the second half of the 20th century, social research was increasingly adopted as a tool by governments and enterprises
 samajashastriyon ne nae prakaar ke maatraatmak or gunatmak shodh vidhiyon kaa vikaas kiya
 Parallel to the rise of various social movements in the 1960s, particularly in Britain, cultural change saw the rise of anti-social theory emphasizing social conflict, which confronted the functionalist approach

 In the tradition of Luke's and Gramsci's, Marxist theorists continued to test consumerism on analogous terms
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main tathakthith uttar-saranchnawadi or uttar-aadhuniktaavaadi siddhant ne, nitshe or ghatana-kriya vigyaniyon ke saath-saath shastreey saamaajik vaigyanikon ko aadhaarit karte hue, saamaajik jaanch ke saanche par kaaphi prabhaav daalaa
 Often, social analysis of postmodernism, marked by intertextuality, mixing and satire, and generally perceived as the cultural genre 'postmodernism', introduced a distinct era that concerned the disintegration of metanarratives and object worship and capitalist
 In the latter half of the society, the reflection reflected with consumption
 Postmodernism is also associated with some thinkers' rejection of Enlightenment conceptions of the human entity, such as Michel Fuco, Claude lévi-strauss, and to a lesser extent Lewis Altuser, an attempt to reconcile Marxism with non-humanism
 Most theorists associated with these movements actively rejected this label, giving the importance of accepting postmodernism as a historical event rather than as some kind of critical method
 phir bhi, sachet uttaradhuniktaa ke ansh saamaanya rup main saamaajik or raajnneetik vigyaan main ubharate rahe
 Sociologists working in the anglo-saxon world, such as Anthony Giddens and Jigmant Baumann, focused on the principles of iterative iteration in terms of the 'higher stage' of communication, globalization, and modernity rather than proposing a specific "new" natural age

 The extent to which the subject can be portrayed as a science has been a major issue in the context of basic nature philosophy and knowledge epistemology questions
 siddhant or anusandhan ke aacharan main kis prakaar atmiyata, nishpakshta, antar-atmiyata or vyaavhaarikta ko ekikrut karen or mahatv den, is baat par vivaad uthte rahete hai
 Although essentially since the 19th century, all the leading theorists have acknowledged that sociology is not a science in the traditional sense of the word, the ability to strengthen causal relations is the same as the basic philosophical discussions made in science trans-theory

 In the same way, positivism has come to the forefront of the critical rationalist non-jurism presented by Karl Popper, who himself is disputed by Thomas Kuhn's concept of paradigm deviation of knowledge epistemology

 Structure and means is a permanent debate point in social theory: "do social structures or human means determine a person's behavior?" In this context, 'means' indicates the ability of individuals to act independently and make free choices, while' structure 'specifies the factors limiting or influencing individuals' choices and actions
 Discussion on the primacy of structure or means is related to the basic core of social authority
 An attempt to reconcile the postmodern critics with the broader project of social science, particularly in Britain, has been the development of critical realism
 raay bhaskar jaise vivechanaatmak yathartwaadiyon ke liye, paaramparik pratyakshvaad, vigyaan ko yani ki khud sanrachana or saadhan ko hi sambhav karne vaale, sattamulak halaaton ke samaadhaan main naakaami kii vajah se 'gyaan tarkdosh' karata he
 Another common consequence of mistrust of highly structural or instrumental thought has been the development of multidimensional theory, particularly Talcott Parsons's theory of action and Anthony Guidden's theory of structuralism

 It was called 'badlain'

 The village was self-dependent
 bazaar hi nahin tha
 Feast festivals contributed to maintaining the collectivity of the village
 rasm-rivaajon ko bhi shrey jaataa tha
 One of the rituals, the custom was 'bayana'
 ek ghar main bane athwa rishtedaaron ke yahaan se aae pakwaanon ko kai gharon main baantne ko byna kaha jaataa tha

 After the 1700th century, as the Industrial Revolution grew at a rapid pace, there was also a considerable increase in population growth
 The rate of population growth in the last 50 years has been even faster and the main reason for this is the growth in the medical world and the significant increase in agricultural productivity, especially the progress made due to the Green Revolution between 1960 and 1995
 In 2007, the United Nations Population Division estimated that in the year 2055 the world population would cross the figure of 10 billion
 In the future, it is expected that the increase in the world's population will reach the peak and after that the population will start to decrease due to economic reasons, health concerns, indiscriminate use and depletion of land and environmental hazards
 There is also an 85% possibility that the world's population will stop increasing before the end of this century
 There is a 60% probability that the world's population will not exceed 10 billion people before the year 2100 and there is a 15% probability that the world's population will be less than the total population of the world at the end of the century
 For different regions, there will be considerable variation in the date and size of the largest population

 This would be useful if fertility control is seen as a personal decision of the individual and population control is seen as a government or state level regulation policy of population growth
 Fertility control is likely to occur when a person or couple or family takes steps to reduce or control their childbirth
 In the formulation given by Ansley Cole, three prerequisites have been given for continued reduction in reproduction: acceptance of choice calculated as a valid element of reproduction, known benefits from reduced reproduction and knowledge of effective methods of control and their use
 Skilled practice of doing
 Unlike societies that believe in natural reproduction, societies that wish to limit reproduction and have the resources available to do so
 wo in sansadhano kaa prayog bacchon ke janm main vilamb, bacchon ke janm ke bich antar rakhane, yaa unke janm ko rokane ke liye kar sakate hai

 At the social level, declining fertility is an inevitable consequence of the increasing secular education of women
 haalaanki, yah zaruri nahin he ki madhyam se ucch str tak ke prajnan niyantran main prajnan dar ko kam karnaa shaamil ho
 Even when comparing different societies which have adopted fertility control quite well, societies with equal fertility control ability can also give very different reproductive levels, which is related to the fact that small Or what is a personal and cultural choice for a large family or for the number of children

 jaisaa kii upar paribhaashit he, sarkaar yaa saamaajik str par 'jansankhya niyantran' ko lagu karne main "prajnan niyantran" shaamil nahin he, kyonki ek rajya samaaj kii jansankhya ko tab bhi niyantrit kar saktaa he jabaki samaaj main prajnan niyantran kaa prayog bahut kam kiya jaataa ho
 It is also necessary to adopt policies that increase population as an aspect of population control and it is important to understand that the government does not want to stop population growth only as a form of population control
 To encourage population growth, the government can not only support immigration but also create additional children by pro-birth policies such as tax benefits, financial rewards, continuation of pay during holidays and helping to care for children
