 hamaari prithvi or surya jis gallexi main avasthit hai, raatri main ham nangi aankh se usee gallexi ke taaraon ko dekh pate hai
 So far, there are estimated to be about 19 billion galaxies in every part of the universe that has been detected
 brahmad ke visphot siddhant ke anusaar sabhi gallexien ek duusare se badi teji se dur hatati ja rahi hai
 a hundred billion galaxies exist in the universe
 jo badi maatra main taare, gas or khagoleey dhul ko samete hue he
 Galaxies began their lives millions of years ago and gradually regained their present form
 prayek gallexiyaan arabon taron ko ko samete hue he
 Gravity binds the stars together, and in this way many galaxies live together in a cluster of stars

 Wright refute this notion by studying the interactions of four groups of galaxies
 unhone yah bataaya ki gallexiyon ke bich main aisi visphotak antar kriyaayein nahin hoti hai jo nai gallexiyon ko janm de saken
 The center of most galaxies is a spherical part filled with stars, called the nucleus, and the nucleus is attached to a planar circular disk around it
 khagolvigyaani gallexiyon ko unke aakaar ke aadhaar par mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit karaten he
 Nobody knows why galaxies assume a certain form

 vibhinn chamak ke taron kii sankhya ginakar, unki duuri kii gananaa kar or unki gati naapakar jyotishiyon ne gallexi ke vaastavik rup kaa bahut acha anumaan laga liya he
 If one considers the form of the galaxy in a three-dimensional recess instead of the one seen in the sky, then it is found that the galaxy is almost like a flat circular wheel whose part near the axis is somewhat bloated
 chitra main gallexi kaa bagal se chitra dikhaaya gaya he 
 The diameter of this wheel is about one million light years, miles or 63 thousand times the distance of the Sun from Earth) and the thickness is between 3,000 and 6,000 light years
 centre ke paas kii motaai lagbhag 15,000 prakashavarsh he

 The mass of our galaxy is approximately one trillion times the mass of the Sun
 isamen se praaia: aadha to taron kaa dravyaman he or aadha dhuli or gas kaa
 Our Galaxy is like a puffed circle in the middle
 isamen ek vrutt ke bheetar hi ve sab taare hai jo hamen akaash main pruthak-pruthak dikhaai padate hai
 Stars and galaxies are scattered sparsely around our galaxy
 hamaari gallexi ke centre ke paas taare sankhya main adhik ghaney hai or kinare kii ore apekshaakrit bikhare hue hai
 All the stars are rotating around the center, the stars near the center are at high speed and the far ones are at low speed
 hamaara surya centre se lagbhag 30-35 hajaar prakashavarsh dur he or gallexi ke madhya tal main hai
 For this reason, we see our galaxy like the mekhala which is described above
 prithvi se gallexi kaa centre dhanu taramandal kii ore he
 That's why it revolves around the center of the Galaxy
 is parikrama main uskaa veg 150 mile prati senkad hai
 Even at this velocity, the sun takes 200 million years in the entire orbit
 kuch teevr gativale taare or goleey targuch hamaari gallexi kii seemaa ke baahar hai, kintu ye bhi hamaari gallexi se sambhddha hai or usee ke ang maane jate hai lagbhag 100 goleey taraguchh gyaat hai
 Their distribution is spherical
 in taragucchon ke vitaran se gallexi kaa centre gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Measuring the speed of wires also helps in the calculation of the center
 rup or vistaar main gallexi bahut si agong niharikaon se milti julati hai

 Hanzhi or Chinese charts are expressions used to write Chinese language and Japanese language
 inhen chini ke liye jab prayog kiya jaae to yah haanazi kehalaate hai or jab japani ke liye prayog kiya jaae to kanji kehalaate hai
 In ancient times they were also used for Korean language and Vietnamese language
 chini bhavchitra duniya kii sab se puraani chalati aa rahi likhane kii vidhi he
 Although there are tens of thousands of images in Chinese, but most of these are only seen in historical writings
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki saadhaaran chini main sakshar hone ke liye teen se chaar hazaar bhavchitron kaa jaananaa kaafii he
 Every Chinese phrase has an accent and a meaning attached to it, and most Chinese words are written with two expressions
 yah dhyaan rahe ki uccharan upbhasha or bhashaa ke saath badalata he
 It is not like the Devanagari script that a letter has the same pronunciation everywhere
 ise samajhane ke liye sochiye ki agar koi pahaad kaa chitra dekhe to vah sabko samaj aa jayega, lekin hindi bolne vaala us shabd ko 'parvat' kahegaa, farsi bolne vaala 'koh' kahegaa or angrezi bolne vaala 'mountain' kahegaa
 Chinese expressions often have two or three forms: samay ke saath-saath bahut saare bhavchitra prachlit ho chuke the or unamem se bahut likhane main bade pechide the, isliye japan or china kii sarkaron ne inamen kuch maanakeekaran or sarleekaran kiye hai
 With this, many words in the Chinese language have two forms - the traditional Chinese form and the simplified Chinese form
 bahut se shabdon ke japani or chini rup bhi milte-julate lekin zaraa bhinn hote hai
 There are several categories of Chinese charts: yah kabhi chitra hua karte the lekin likhaai main aasaani laane ke liye or maanakeekaran karne ke baad inaki shaklein thodi badal gai hai
 For example, व्यक्ति means 'person', 日 ie 'sun', 月 means 'moon' and 木 means 'tree'
 lagbhag 4% chini bhavchitra is shrenee ke hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'pictogram'
 yah chitron main thodaa pher-badal kar ke unhen anya matlab dete hai
 For example, where 木 means 'tree', जोड़कर is formed by joining two trees, which means 'clump'
 agar teen vriksh jodakar 森 likhe, to iskaa arth 'jangal' hota he
 In the same way चाकू means 'knife' but by marking its edge, 刃 is made, ie 'edge'
 zaraa-zaraa se nishaan banane se nae arthon vaale shabd banaae gaye hai
 In English, the words in this category are called 'idiogram'
 inamen ek se adhik chitron yaa bhavchitron ko jodakar nae arthon vaale shabd banaae jate hai
 For example, combining 'sun' and 'i
e
' moon 'makes' light'
 yadi vyakti ko ped se joda jaae to 休 banataa he, jiskaa matlab he 'vishram' 
 Similarly, adding 女 and 子 makes 好, meaning 'good' is determined
 haalanki isapar kuch bhashavaigyanikon kaa vivaad he, isaki ek anya misaal 'chat' ke liye 宀 chihn ko 'stri' ke liye 女 chihn ke saath milakar 安 bananaa he, jiskaa arth 'shaanti' he 
 Even in modern times, such new expressions have been fabricated according to need
 platinum ek moolyawaan safed dhaatu hoti he, jiske liye bhavchitra 鉑 he, jo 'safed' or 'dhaatu' ko milakar bana he
 In the same way, combining 'meter' and 'thousand' was made - it started being used around the end of the nineteenth century
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'idiogramic compoundj' kehete hai
 Sometimes it has happened that there was no sign for anything but if the word was pronounced by another word for which the image was, then that mark was used for both
 masalan, bahut chini bhashaaon main 'zee' shabd kaa arth 'naak' bhi tha or 'swayan' bhi tha
 The symbol for 'nose' was और and it also came to be used for 'self'
 vaqt ke saath is chihn kaa 'naak' arth to bhula diya gaya or aadhunik chini lipi main iskaa arth sirf 'swayan' rah gaya he
 The name of this category is derived from 'rebus' English
 chini lipi ke sab se adhik shabd is shrenee ke hote hai
 They contain one or more signs that describe the meaning of the word and a graphic that has nothing to do with the meaning but is a sign of something that is similar to the word
 is se shabd kaa uccharan or matlab donon pataa chal jate hai

 Ghatak's father Suresh Chandra Ghatak was a district magistrate as well as a poet and playwright and his mother's name was Indubala Devi

 Ghatak's wife Surma was a school teacher and his son Ritban is a film producer
 unki mrityu ke samay, ghatak kaa praathmik prabhaav, purv chaatro ke madhyam se hota hua prathit hua
 Although his film teaching tenure at FTII was brief, his students Mani Kaul, John Abraham, and especially Kumar Shahani, pushed Ghatak's ideas and theories into the mainstream of Indian artistic cinema, detailed in his book Cinema and i Get into apatiai main unke anya chaatro main shaamil he bahuprashansit film nirmaataa said akhtar mirza or adur gopalkrishnan
 Ghatak was completely outside the Indian commercial film world

 While other realistic directors such as Satyajit Ray succeeded in creating audiences outside India in their lifetime, Ghatak was not so lucky in this matter
 unke jivan kaal ke dauraan, unki filmein mukhyatah bharat main hi saraahi gai
 Satyajit Ray tried his best to promote his colleague, but Ray's generous praise was also unable to garner international fame for Ghatak

 Karz in particular was remade several times: in the form of the Kannada film Yuga Purush, the Tamil film Enakul Oruvan and the recent Bollywood film Karza
 Karz and the Reincarnation of Peter Proud likely inspired the American film Chance r Us

sa
 1918 se 1936 tak kii pramukh yugavani rahi
 Spiritual expression, love of nature, love of women, humanization, cultural awakening, imaginary primacy, etc
 are the main features of cinematic poetry
 chhayavaad ne hindi main khadi boli kavita ko purnatah pratishthit kar diya
 After this Brajbhasha got out of the Hindi poetry stream
 isane hindi ko nae shabd, pratik tathaa bimb die
 This effect also enriched the language of prose of this period
 hindi kavita main chhayavaad kaa yug dvivedi yug ke baad aayaa
 The poetry of Dwivedi era was monotonous didactic and chronological
 chhayavaad main iske viruddh vidroh karte hue kalpanapradhan, bhavonmeshyukt kavita rachi gai
 It was greatly influenced by the Gitanjali of the famous poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore of Bangla of his era at the level of language and sentiments
 yah pracheen sanskrit sahitya or madhyakaalin hindi sahitya se bhi prabhavit hui
 In this, the influence of Buddhist philosophy and Sufi philosophy is also targeted
 chhayavadyug us saanskrithik or saahitiyik jaagran kaa saarvbhaum vikaaskaal tha jiskaa aarambh rashtriya paridhi main bhaaratenduyug se hua tha
 Not only the subtle emotional philosophy of the poet, 'chhaya' also introduces his subtle articulation
 uski kavyakala main vaacharth kii apeksha lakshanikta or dhvanyaatmakataa he
 There is also malaise due to the purity of the feeling
 style main raag kii navdbuddhata athwa naveen vyanjaktaa he
 In the Dwivedi era, poetry was composed of poetry
 vastut: gadhy kaa prabandh hi usamen padya ho gaya tha, bhashaa bhi gadhyvat ho gai thi
 Shadowism broke the structure of the verse and made the standing dialect poetic
 padya main sthool itivrutt tha, chhayavaad ke kavy main bhavatmak atanrvrutt tha, chhayavaad ke kavy main bhavatmak antarvrutt aa gaya
 According to sentiment, the language and verses of Chhayavad also became emotional and sentimental
 brajabhasha ke baad chhayavaad dwaara geetkavy kaa punarutthan hua
 Representative poets of the Shadow Age era are Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Mahadevi, Ramkumar
 purvanugami sahyogi hai- maakhanlaal or 'naveen'
 After Geetakavya, the epic was also produced in Chhatism
 tulsidas jaise 'swant:' ko lekar loksangrah ke path par agrasar hue the vaise hi chhayavaad ke kavi bhi 'swatm' ko lekar ekant ke swagat jagat se saarvajanik jagat main agrasar hue
 Prasad's 'kamayani' and Pant's 'lokayatan' are proof of this
 'kamayani' sindhu main vindu kii ore he, 'lokayatan' vindu main sindhu kii ore
 Around 1917, the poet Maithili Sharan Gupta, Mukutdhar Pandey, etc
, tended to give Khadiboli poetry a more imaginative, pictorial, and emotional expression
 This free and novel method was finding its way out that the mystical poems of Rabindranath were celebrated
 or kai kavi ek saath rahasyavaad or pratikwaad athwa chitrabhashavad ko hi ekant dhairya banakar chal pade
 When the goal was fixed on the picture language or expression method, then the field of cosmic or supernatural love was deemed to be the rest for its performance
 is bandhe hue kshetra ke bheetar chalanevaale kavy ne chhayavaad naam grahan kiya
 The use of the word shadowy should be understood in two meanings
 ek to rahasyavaad ke arth main, jahaan uskaa sambandh kavy-vastu se hota he arthath jahaan kavi us anant or agyaat priyatam ko alamban banaakar atyant chitramayi bhashaa main prem kaa anek prakaar se vyanjan karata he
 The second use of this meaning is in the broader sense of poetry-style or method-specific
 'shadowism generally means the presentation of the unprepared as a euphemistic shadow in place of the present
 chhayavaad kaa chalan dvivedi kaal kii rukhi itivrittatmak kii pratikriya ke rup main hua tha
 For example, my honey songs are hidden in a pile of dust, unknowingly
 prakruti ke sookshm kintu vyakt saundarya main aadhyatmik chaaya kaa bhaan mere vichaar se chhayavaad kii ek sarvamaanya vyakhya honi chahie
 ' dwitiya mahayuddh ke samaapt hote saare desh main nai chetana kii lahar daud gai
 In 1929, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, India became determined to sweep away foreign slavery
 ise sirf raajnneeti tak hi simit nahin samajhnaa chaiye
 It was an attempt to understand the self-image of the entire country and by correcting its mistakes, it was resolved to move towards the antipathy towards the rich nations of the world
 sankshep main, yah ek mahaan saanskrithik andolan tha
 Mindful orientation was the main origin of this poem and its strong faith in the changing mind
 is shrenee ke kavi grahikashakti se bahut adhik sampann the or saamaajik vishmata or asamanjasyon ke prati atyadhik sajag the
 In terms of style too, they were completely different from earlier poets
 inaki rachana mukhyatah vishayi pradhan thi
 In the 1920s Khadiboli poetry, the primacy of the theme remained
 parantu iske baad kii kavita main kavi ke apane raag-viraag kii pradhanta ho gai
 How is the subject in itself? This was not the main thing
 balki mukhya baat yah rah gai thi ki vishayi ke chitt ke raag-viraag se anuranjit hone ke baad vishay kaisaa dikhta he ? parinaam vishay isamen gaun ho gaya or kavi pramukh’ Around 1920, the enlightened consciousness of the era, depressed by external expression, started self-oriented introverted cultivation, it was expressed in poetry as shadowism ' ‘ chhayavaad shabd kaa arth chaahe jo ho, parantu vyaavhaarik drushti se yah prasad, niraala, pant, mahadevi kii un samast kavitaaon kaa dyotak he, jo 1918 se 36 i
 ke bich likhi gayi
 'he further writes-' Shadowism is the poetic expression of the national awakening which wanted liberation from the old stereotypes on the one hand and foreign subjugation on the other
 ’ 'in the field of poetry, unlike any incident of mythological era or external description of the beauty of the country and abroad, when the self-evident expression started on the basis of anguish, in Hindi, it was designated as Chhayavism
 ’ prasad ji ant main kehete hai- chhayavaadi kavita bhartiya drushti se anubhuti or abhivyakti kii bhangima par adhik nirbhar karti he
 Phoneticism, semiotics, beauty, nature-law, and the variability of self-perception along with healing curvature are characteristic of Chhatism
 ’ Chadism is considered influenced by Romanticism of Western literature
 ve chhayavaad kaa mul darshan sarvatmavaad ko maanati hai or prakruti ko uskaa saadhan
 His cinematography laid down life in relation to the heart and nature of man, which has been in the form of image since ancient times and due to which man felt nature depressed in his grief and pulsed in happiness' thus Mahadevi According to the poetry of Shadowism, by creating a positive connection with our nature, we generate a wide feeling in our heart and we are all over the world
 Integral expressions regarding the causes've added
 ve rahasyavaad ko chhayavaad kaa doosraa sopan maanati hai
 We can divide the major trends of Shadowism under three or two headings
 chhayavaad main sabhi kaviyon ne apane anubhav ko meraa anubhav kahkar abhivyakt kiya he
 It differs from devotional soul expression on two levels
 ek to chhayavaad main atmabhivykti purv ke kisi bhi sahitya se adhik hui he
 Secondly, poets have no metaphor or cover for it
 unhone prem ko bhi apana prem kahkar usapar kavita likhi he
 Pant wrote 'balika was my captivating friend' and Nirala was 'I alone'
 nari-saundarya or prem-chithran chhayavaadi kaviyon ne nari ko prem kaa alamban mana he
 He embraced the woman as a beloved, who is full of all the feelings of youth and heart
 jisamen dharti kaa saundarya or swarg kii kaalpanik sushamaa samanvit he
 Therefore, these poets have written many pictures of the beloved
 kamayani main prasad ne shraddha ke chithran main jaadu bhar diya he
 The love of shadowy poets is also special
 prakruti saundarya kaa sarsatam varnan or usase prem kaa varnan bhi chhayavaadi kaviyon kii ullekhneey visheshta he
 Bygone vibrari yaa Expiration time was above the cloudy sky vah sandhya sundari pari-si dhire-dhire
 The trend of the romanticism begins with the poems of Sridhar Pathak
 padya ke swaroop, abhivyanjana ke dhang or prakruti ke swaroop kaa nirikshan aadi pravritiyaan chhayavaad main prakat hui
 As well as the direct exclusion of self-realization, which extends from personal love to compassion and bliss
 aalochakon ne chhayavaad par svachhndata kaa prabhaav bataaya he to duusari ore iskaa virodh bhi prakat kiya he
 This tendency of romanticism is always against country, time, and trends
 jahaan kahin bhi bandhan hai, samaaj, rajya, kavita or jivan- tamaam staron par in rudhiyon kaa svachhndatavaadi kavi virodh karata he
 English literature had strict discipline before Romantic poetry and its form was also religious, moral and poetic
 atah angreji kaviyon ne in bandhanon kaa tiraskaar kiya
 But the pre-dwivediuga from the Chhayawadi poets has the primacy of moral vision and the Chhayawadi also shows opposition to it
 chhayavaadi pravriti svachhnd pranay kii nahin kintu punarutthanavaadee zyada thi
 Because reticulate makeup has an effect on her
 jahaan darshanik siddhanton kaa sambandh he chhayavaadi kavy main sarvaad, karmwaad, vedant, shaiva-darshan, advaitvaad aadi puraane siddhanton kii abhivyakti milti he
 As far as language-style is concerned, the expressive method of Chhayawadi is new and refreshing
 dvivediyugin khadiboli main sthulata, varnanaatmakataa adhik he
 But in chauvinist poetry, the treatment of curvature and humanization features due to the representation of subtlety
 dvivediyugin kavy vishaynishth, varnan- pradhan or sthool he to chhayavaadi kavy vyaktinishth or kalpana-pradhan he
 Dwivediugin poetry incorporates the breadth and diversity of the universe
 usee prakaar chhayavaad kii kavita main manojgat kii vaani ko prakat karne kaa praytn he
 The shadowy poets have used energetic imagination to realize the subtle truths of the occult
 chhayavaad main vedant se lekar anandwad tak kaa prabhaav dikhaai padataa he
 It also gives a glimpse of Buddhist and Gandhi philosophy

 kisi adhik garm pind se kisi adhik thande pind main ooshmaa ke pargaman ko ooshmaa antaran kehete hai
 When the temperature of an object is different from that of its surroundings or other object, the transmission of heat energy, also known as the flow of heat or exchange of heat, takes place in such a way that the object and its surroundings take heat-equilibrium
 ; This means that both have the same temperature
 ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam yaa clogiyas ke kathan ke anusaar ooshmaa kaa sanchaar hameshaa adhik garm vastu se adhik thandi vastu kii ore hota he
 Wherever there are variations of temperature in nearby objects, heat communication between them can never be stopped; It can only be reduced
 padaarth ke kanon main sighe sampark se ooshmaa ke sanchaar ko sanchaalan kehete hai
 The transmission of energy may occur primarily by suppressive combustion such as in liquids or by osmosis as in metals or by phonon vibrations as in insulators
 anya shabdon main, jab aasapaas ke parmaanu ek duusare ke prati kampan karte hai, yaa electron ek parmaanu se duusare main jate hai tab ooshmaa kaa sanchaar sanchaalan dwaara hota he
 Conduction is more common in solids, where a mesh of relatively stable spatial relationships between atoms helps in the transmission of energy between them by vibration
 aisi sthiti main jahaan drav kaa pravaah bilkul bhi na ho rahaa ho, taap sanchaalan, drav main kanon ke paraasaran se sidhe anuroop hota he
 This type of heat osmosis differs from nodular osmosis occurring in solids in behavior, whereas codis osmosis is mostly confined to liquids
 dhaatuen saamanytah taap urja kii sarvottam sanchaalak hoti hai
 This is due to the way the metals are chemically bonded; Metallic bonds contain freely moving electrons that can rapidly transmit heat energy to a metal
 jaise-jaise ghanatv ghatata he, sanchaalan bhi ghatata he
 Therefore, fluids are less conductors
 aisa gas main parmaanuon ke bich adhik duuri hone se hota he: parmaanuon ke bich kam takaraav hone kaa matlab he, kam sanchaalan
 taapmaana ke saath gaison ke bad jaati he kii chaalakata

 ghanatv main is bindu ke baad, badhate hue dabaav or ghanatv ke saath sanchaalan jaraa sa hi badhata he
 To calculate how easily a particular medium operates, engineers use thermal conductivity, also known as the conductance constant or the operation multiplier, k
 ooshm sanchaalakata main k kii paribhaasha he – ‘taapmaana main bhinnata ke kaaran samay main kisi sthaan kii sataha se saamaanya disha main kisi motaai main se sancharit taap kii maatra, Q’
 ooshm sanchaalakata ek padaartheey gun he jo praathmik taur par madhyam kii avasthaa, taapmaana, ghanatv or anvik bonding par nirbhar hota he
 a heat pipe is a passive device that is constructed in such a way that it appears to have extremely high thermal conductivity
 sthir avasthaa ke sanchaalan main ek bhaag main pravesh kar rahaa taap usase baahar nikal rahe taap ke baraabar hota he
 In the steady state operation, all the rules of direct electric conduction apply to 'flow of heat'
 aise maamalon main ‘ooshm pratikultaaon’ ko vidyut pratikultaaon ke samaan mana ja saktaa he
 Temperature plays the role of voltage and is synonymous with transmitted thermal current
 jab kabhi bhi kisi vastu kaa bhitari taap sanchaalan uski parisima ke taap sanchaalan se kaaphi teji se hota he to samuhik pranali vishleshan dwaara asthir sanchaalan kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This regression method reduces one aspect of an unstable operating system appropriately

 When the thermal resistance is transferred to the object of heat, the resistance is less than the heat being completely diffused within the object, at least the Biot number is 1
 In this case, Biot numbers are also specifically for the smaller, The approximation of the spatially uniform temperature within the object can be used to start the object, since it can be assumed that the heat is transferred uniformly to the uniformly distributed time
 For, as to do so due to low resistance, entered the object to compare with the heat resistance
 upyogi rup se sahi upgaman or taap sanchaar vishleshan ke liye biot number saamanytah 0

 saath hi iskaa prayog aaraam ke str ke parivesh main parivartanon ke lagbhag kshanmaatr ke prabhaavon ko nishchit karne ke liye HVAC main kiya jaataa he
 The transmission of heat energy from molecules of one substance to another is called conduction
 taral kii gati ke badhane ke saath-saath samvaahit taap sanchaar bhi badhata he
 The presence of momentum in the magnitude of the fluid promotes the transmission of heat between the solid surface and the liquid
 samvaahit taap sanchaar ke do prakaar hote hai: Convection can also be classified on the basis of internal and external flows
 aantark pravaah tab hota he jab taral kisi thos daayre main band ho jaise kisi pipe main hone vaala pravaah
 bahya pravaah tab hota he jab koi taral bina kisi thos sataha se sampark main aae anishchit kaal tak failata jaataa he
 These two convections, whether natural or forced, can be internal or external because they are independent of each other
 samvaahit taap sanchaar kii dar di jaati he: a is the area of the surface of thermal communication
 t s sataha kaa taapmaana he or t b balk taapmaana par taral kaa taapmaana he
 But t b varies according to the situation and is the temperature of the liquid located 'far away' from the surface
 h sthir taap sanchaar gunak he jo taral ke bhautik gunon jaise taapmaana or bhautik sthiti jisamen sanvaahan hota he, par nirbhar hota he
 Therefore heat communication multiplier should be obtained for every analyzed system
 Several formulas and correlations are available for calculating heat communication coefficients for ideal structures and fluids
 patali part ke pravahon ke liye taap sanchaar gunak ashaant pravahon kii apeksha kam hota he; aisa ashaant pravahon ke taap sanchaar sataha par taral kii adhik patali nishchal part hone ke kaaran hota he
 The communication of heat energy into a space is called radiation
 param shunya ke upar ke taapmaana vaali sabhi vasteen unki pravaahakta guna yadi ve koi kaale rang kii vastu hon to unamem se urja ke vikirit hone kii dar ke baraabar urja kaa vikiran karti hai
 No medium is needed for radiation because it is transmitted by electromagnetic waves; Radiation also works in complete vacuum
 surya kii urja prithvi ko garm karne ke pehle antariksh ke nirvaat main se guzarati he
 The reflectivity and conductivity of all bodies depend on both wavelengths

 The reflectivity for any body depends on the distribution of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation coming in and therefore the temperature of the source of radiation
 pravaahakta tarangadairghy ke vitaran par or isaliye pind ke taapmaana par nirbhar karti he
 For example, fresh ice, which is highly reflective for visible light, looks white due to reflecting sunlight with peak energy wavelength of about 0
5 micrometer
 parantu kareeb -5 °C taapmaana or 12 micrometer ke sheersh urja tarangadairghy par uski pravaahakta 0

 Gases absorb and emit energy in specific patterns of wavelength, which vary for each gas
 dikhne vaala prakaash vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa ek or prakaar he jo infrared vikiran kii apeksha kam tarangadairghy vaala hota he
 Radiation from objects of visible light and conventional temperatures varies by a factor of about 20 in frequency and wavelength; Both types of emissions are simply different "colors" of electromagnetic radiation

 yah niyam vishisht sameekaran ke rup main diya gaya he: This type of heat loss formula is sometimes not more accurate; The exact formula requires an analysis of the heat flow based on the heat communication equation in a non-uniform or low conductor medium
 lagaataar kramiktaaon kaa ek anuroop forier kaa niyam he
 The following simplification can be used as per the agreement of the bayot number relating the surface conductivity of the object to the internal heat conductivity

 taap kshamta c ki paribhaasha se sambandh c = dq / dt praapt hota he
 Analyzing this equation in terms of time gives the following identity: dq / dt = C
 This expression can be used in place of dq / dt in the first equation given at the beginning of this section above
 tab, yadi t samay par aise kisi pind kaa taapmaana t he or pind ke parivesh ke vaataavaran kaa taapmaana Tenv he: so: r = ha / c pranali kaa ek sakaaratmak constent vishisht gun he jo 1 / time kii ikai main hona chaiye or isaliye kabhi-kabhi vishisht samay constent t0 ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he: r = 1 / t0 = ΔT / 
 is tarah taap pranaaliyon main, t0 = c / ha 
 Thus the above equation can be usefully written in this way: seemaa kii dashaon ke samavesh or visthaapan ke adarsh tareekon dwaara is sameekaran kaa hal yah he: Here, t t is the time temperature in t and zero time, t = 0 or t is the initial temperature

 An extremely useful principle in heat communication experiments is the representation of heat communication by heat circuits
 a heat circuit is a representation of the resistance to flow of heat as if it were an electrical resistor
 The transmitted heat corresponds to the electric wave and the heat resistance corresponds to the electrical resistor

 The case was first reported in a paper in 1957 by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner
 vah ek marij tha jo nau saal kii umr main cycle durghatana ke kaaran gambhir mirgee se peedit tha
 Physicians were unable to control their seizures with drugs, so neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery
 unhone ek asthaayee lobatomi karke dwipaksheeya rup se apane madhyavarti asthaayee lob ko hataa diya
 His epilepsy improved, but Molaison lost the ability to create new long-term memories
 unhone saamaanya short-turm memory kshamta pradarshit kii
 If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time
 vastav main, vah bhul jayega ki use pehle sthaan par bhi ek suchi di gai thi
 Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists, he was unable to recall them again from long-term memory
 isane shodhakartaaon ko saboot diya ki alpakaalik or dirghakaalik smriti vastav main do alag-alag prakriyaayein hai
 Even though he forgot about lists, he was still able to learn things through his underlying memory

 Although he could never remember that task, he would improve after doing so again and again
 isse manovaigyanikon ne dikhaaya ki vah behoshee se chizon ko sikh rahaa tha or yaad kar rahaa tha
 The studies were completed continuously throughout Molaison's life to learn more about amnesia
 shodhakartaaon ne molison par 14 saal kaa anuvarthi adhyayan kiya
 He studied for a period of two weeks to learn more about his labyrinth
 14 saalon ke baad, molison abhi bhi apni surgery ke baad hui chizon ko yaad nahin kar sakaa
 However, he could still remember things that happened before the operation
 shodhakartaaon ne yah bhi paaya ki, jab poocha gaya, molison rashtriya yaa antarrashtriya ghatnaon ke bare main sawaalon kaa jawaab de saktaa he, lekin vah apni vyaktigat yaadon ko yaad nahin kar sakaa
 After his death, Molaison donated his brain to science, where he was able to find the areas of the brain whose wounds contained his blunders

 sheikh abdulla ke netritv main muslim conference us samay kashmir kii mukhya rajnatik party thi
 Kashmiri Pandits, Sheikh Abdullah and most of the Muslims of the state wanted to merge Kashmir with India
 par pakistan ko ye bardaasht hi nahin tha ki koi muslim-bahumat praant bharat main rahe 
 So in 1947-48, Pakistan invaded Kashmiri with tribes and its camouflage army and seized much of it
 us samay pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne mohammad ali jinna se vivaad janamat-sangrah se sulajhane kii peshkash kii, jise jinna ne us samay thukraa diya kyonki unako apni sainik karrwai par puraa bharosa tha

 It was due to Pandit Nehru's efforts that Mountbatten was made the first Governor General of independent India, while Jinnah refused to accept Mountbatten as the first Governor General of Pakistan, which Mountbatten had regretted all his life
 mountabeton 24 march 1947 se 30 june 1948 tak bharat main rahe
 In these fifteen months he was not only the constitutional head but also decisive of India's important policies
 pan nehru unhen sadaiv apana mitra, maardarshak tathaa mahanatam salaahkaar maanate rahe
 He also considered Pandit Nehru as a "brilliant", "always reliable" "imaginative" and "theoretical socialist"
 kashmir ke prashn par bhi mountabeton ke vichaaron ko pan nehru ne atyadhik mahatv diya
 Pandit Nehru also had deep ties with Sheikh Abdullah

 ve isse bhi parichit the ki "quit kashmir aandolan" ke dwaara shaikh abdulla maharaja ko hataakar, swayan shashan sanbhaalane ko aatur he
 While Pandit Nehru became the interim Prime Minister of India, an incident further exacerbated this acrimony
 shaikh abdulla ne srinagar kii ek conferes main pandit nehru ko aane kaa nimantran diya tha
 The main proposal in this conference was to remove Maharaja Kashmir
 majaboor hokar maharaja ne pan nehru se is kfrons main na aane ko kaha
 However, Pandit Nehru was stopped in Jammu before going to Srinagar
 pan nehru ne ise apana apmaan samajha tathaa ve ise jivan bhar na bhuule
 In order to teach a lesson to Raja Hari Singh at the time of Pakistani army and tribal invasion, Nehru ji deliberately delayed sending the Indian army, which succeeded in capturing two-third of Kashmir

 parantu maharaja ne vinamratapurvak is aagrah ko taalte hue kaha tha ki vah ek padosi desh ke garvanar general ko tehraane kii aupchaarikta puri nahin kar paaenge

 In this way, after a certain period, if all these items are accounted for, then one country has to take payment from another and the other country has to pay the payment of a third country
 vibhinn deshon ke bich is prakaar ke parasparik len dein ke shesh ko bhugtan shesh kehete hai
 It should be said that the difference between the gross amount repaid by a country to other countries on a given date and the gross amount it receives from other countries is called the 'balance of payments' of that country
 kisi ek desh ko duusare deshon se bhugtan praapt karne kaa adhikaar tathaa avasar tab aata he jab vah desh un deshon ko maal niryaat kare, athwa apane jahaajon, bainkon, insurance companiyon tathaa kushal visheshgyon dwaara apni sevaayen pradaan kare athwa un deshon ke udyog vyapaar main apni poonji lagaakar labhaansh tathaa byaaj praapt karen
 It may also happen that he receives payment of the principal of loans given by that country to other countries or he gets loan form from other countries
 iske atirikt yah bhi sambhav he ki anya deshon ke deshaatak paryatak us desh main aakar maal khariden yaa sevaaon kaa upbhog kare
 In all these circumstances, that country will have the opportunity to receive payment from other countries
 iske vipareet, sambhav he, inhen madon par us desh ko anya deshon kaa kuch bhugtan chukaana bhi ho
 Thus, on one date, the difference between the successful liability of a country on all these items will be known as the remaining balance of that country
 vaise to desh ke bich is prakaar kaa len dein kisi na kisi mad par nirantar chalata rahata he, par yadi kisi nishchit tithi ko ek desh kaa vibhinn madon par len dein kaa antar nikaala jaae to avashya nimna paristhitiyon main se koi ek paristhiti saamne aati he: Thus the balance of payments is called 'favorable', 'counter-productive' and 'balanced' or 'favor', 'opposition' and 'equal'
 par iskaa sambandh kisi desh vishesh ke saath saapeksh arth main vyakt karnaa chahie
 It is not meaningful to say that the balance of payments is favorable, unfavorable and balanced; But it has to be said that the balance of the payment of such country on such date or during such period is favorable, unfavorable or balanced
 bhugtan shesh nikaalane main na keval maal ke aayaat niryaat kaa aadhiky jise 'vyapaar shesh' kehete hai, gyaat kiya jaataa he varan ukt varnit sabhi madon se sakal lendaree or sakal dendaree kaa antar bhi gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The balance of payments is essentially balanced in a continuous sequence of transactions, but the balance of payments of a country to a particular date is found to be favorable or unfavorable
 kisi desh kaa anukool tathaa pratikul bhugtan shesh us desh kii aantarik aarthik sthiti kaa parichaayak mana jaataa he
 If the balance of payments remained favorable, it would mean the abundance of exports by that country, the abundance of production, the strength of industry trade, the earning of foreign exchange, and the increase in the gold reserves of the nation
 iske vipareet pratikul bhugtan shesh kaa arth hoga aayaat kaa bahulya, vyapaar udyog kii shithilataa, utpaadan main giravat, viniyog kaa abhaav, videshi mudra or raashtra ke swarnakosh main kami
 In the present era of planning and development, it has become imperative to import the required quantity of capital goods and skilled experts from developed countries, that the payment should remain favorable in favor of the rest of the country

 Asaf-ud-daula was the son of Wazir and shuja-ud-daula, the Nawabs of Awadh between 1775 and 1797, their mother and grandmother bereft of Awadh

 When Warren Hastings asked the Nawab to pay the dues to the British East India Company, he asked his mother for a loan of 26 lakh rupees and in return he gave her a four-fold price
 iske baad purna rihaai ke evaj main 30 lakh or praapt kiye, saath hi jaagiron main aaajeevan company dwaara koi hastkshep na hone kaa vaada bhi kiya gaya

 It is said that neither Waab Asaf gave work to more than 20,000 people in this project, it was neither a mosque nor a graveyard

 Thus his honor was upheld

 He died on 21 September 1797 in Lucknow and at this time his grave is in Bada Imambara, Lucknow
