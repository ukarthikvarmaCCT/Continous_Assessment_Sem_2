 is shabd kii sateek vyutpatti agyaat he, lekin kuch prameya is prakaar hai: Pope Nicholas II, born Gerrard de Burgogan, died from 24 January 10 59 until the death of the Pope
 apane chunaav ke samay, vah florence ke bishap the' Benedict was elected in the tenth 1058, his elections were arranged by Tosclum's calculations
 However, many cardinals alleged that the election was irregular, and that these votes were purchased; These cardinals were forced to flee Rome
 Later Pol Gregory VII, Hillebrand, decided to oppose it when he heard of Benedict's election and instead received support for the election of Gérard de Burgogne did
 disambar 1058 main, un cardinal, jinhone benedict chunaav kaa virodh kiya, siena main mili or por ke rup main gerard ko chunaa
 He then took the name Nicholas II
 nicholas dwitiya ne rome kii taraf rukh kiya, jis tarah se sutri main ek dharmasabha yojit karne ke raste main, jahaan unhone benedict ko hatotsahit kiya or bahishkrut kiya
 Nicholas ii's supporters gained control of Rome and forced Benedict to flee to Gerrard of Galleria
 rome main aane ke baad, nicholas dwitiya ne benedict or uske samarthakon ke khilaaf norman sahaayta ke saath yuddh ladane ke liye aage bad diya 1059 kii shuruyaat main campanna kii praarambhik ladaai main, nicholas dwitiya puri tarah se safal nahin tha
 But later that same year, his forces captured Praneste, Tusculum, and Normantanum, and took over the Galleria in the autumn, forcing Benedict to surrender and abandon Dad
 apni sthiti ko surakshit karne ke liye, nicholas II ne ek baar normons ke saath sambandhon main pravesh kiya
 The Pope wanted to rediscover Sicily for Christianity, and he saw the Normans as the right power to crush the Muslims
 normans is samay dridhtaa se dakshini italy main sthapit the, or baad main 1059 main nae gathbandhan ko malphi main banaaya gaya tha, jahaan pope, hldebrands, cardinal hambert or monte casino ke abot deciderius ke saath, robert giscard ke saath gambhirtha se nivesh kiya tha apullia, kailabria or sicili ke dachiyaan, or capua kii riyasat ke saath evarsa ke richard, carch ke adhikaron kii suraksha main sahaayta ke vaade kii shapath or sahaayta kaa vaada
 This system, which was not based on any firm foundation compared to the "donation of Constantine", was destined to give the papal freedoms from both the eastern and western kingdoms
 iskaa pehla fal gailaree ko lene main norman sahaayta tha, jahaan antipopope benedict das chupa tha, or roman raison ke liye popatia ke adhinsth hone kaa ant tha
 Meanwhile, Nicholas II sent Peter Damien and Bishop Anselam of Luca as inheritors of Milan, to resolve the conflict between the Patérens and the Archbishop and the clergy
 nateeja popasi ke liye ek taaja jeet thi
 Milan presented the terms of inheritance of the archbishop Widow, who had been subdued from Milan to Rome, facing a devastating sectarian conflict
 nae sambodhan kii ghoshnaa vido or anya milaniyon ke bishpon kii anicchhuk upasthiti ne april 1059 main letr pales ko bulaayaa parishad main kii thi
 This council not only issued the Hylabandin reforms by intensifying the discipline of the clergy, but marked an era the Pope's history by his famous appropriation of future elections for the Holy See isse pehle, pope chunaavon ko prabhavi dhang se roman abhijaat varg dwaara niyantrit kiya gaya tha, jab tak ki samraat paryaapt majboot tha taaki vah apni ichha ko lagu karne ke liye duuri se hastkshep karne main sakasham ho sake
 As a result of the battle with Antipope Benedict X, Nicholas II wished to reform the Pope elections
 easter main letteran main yojit dharmasabha main 1059, pope nicholas ne 113 adhyapakon ko rome main kai sudhaaron par vichaar karne ke liye laayaa, jisamen chunaav prakriya main badlaav shaamil tha
 The electoral reform adopted by that Synod amounted to a manifesto of independence from the Church
 iske baad, pope ko rome main vidhansabhaon dwaara vidhansabha dwaara chunaa janaa tha

 saanchaa:is bandargah se mukhyatah ayask niryaat kiya jaataa he Powada is a famous folk singing of Maharashtra
 mukhyatah yah shivaji maharaj ke yuddh kaushal kaa yashogaan tathaa stuti he
 Powada is the singing and writing type of Veer Ras which is popular in Maharashtra
 mul rup se dalit samudaayon dwaara gaaye jane vaale gaathagiton kii is vidha ne shivaji maharaj ko yuddh ladane ke liye prerit kiya
 Poovada means to sing in the ancient Marathi language
 marathi main powada gane waalon ko shaahir kaha jaataa he
 The term Shahir is as old as Marathi culture
 shaahir sahitya ko marathi kavitaaon kaa udaykaal kaha jaataa he
 This is the type of song that gives a feeling to Marathi speakers
 bharat main iskaa udai 17ve shatabdhi main hua
 In this, the song is composed by putting a historical event in front
 is geet prakaar kii rachana karanevaale geetkaaron ko shaahir kahaan jaataa he
 During this time, the singers who have done this business are called Gondhali
 powada marathi sahitya kii ek pramukh vidha he powada jise gondhal dalit jati ke log gaate the par aage chalakar, shivaji ke baad, sabhi jatiyon ke logon ne ise apana liya
 The description of wars was the main subject of the Powada singers, which they used to describe very vividly and vigorously, that was a period of internal conflicts and external invasions
 atah apane ashrayadaataaon ko unki puri takat se yuddh ladane ke liye prerit karnaa, us kaal ke kavi kaa pramukh kartavya-sa ban gaya tha
 But Mahatma Phule used Powada for public awakening
 In the days of freedom struggle and after independence, Powada became the song of national movement and people's movements respectively
 powada ko samakaleen maratha itihaas kaa vishwasaneey sakshi mana gaya he
 Although the history of Powara starts from the 17th century, but before the coronation of Shivaji, in the Yadav period, the devotional songs sung in Dnyaneshwari were a form of Powara itself
 shivaji maharaj ke kaal main clasik powada ke beej boe gaye
 The tradition of Shahir literature began in the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 shivaji ke kaal main pratham powada ‘afjal khana vadh’ 1659 main agnidas dwaara gaaya gaya, jisamen shivaji dwaara afjal khan ke vadh kaa varnan kiya gaya tha
 It is recorded in the Gazette of Maharashtra
 doosraa mahatvapurn powada tha tanaji malsure dwaara singhgarh par kabja karne ke bare main, jise tulsidas ne gaya
 Equally important is the Powada sung by Yamaji Bhaskar about Baji Pasalkar
 shivaji ke anek powada gaae gaye jaise shivaji avtari purush, shiv pratigya, pratapgarcha ransangram, shahistakhan chaa paraabhav, shivaji maharaj powada, chhatrapati rajmata jijabai, shivaranye punya samaran, singhgarh, shivarajbhishek, samaajawaadee shiv chhatrapati, shiv-gaurav, shivadarshan, purogami shivaji, shivasambhav, shivakavy ityadi
 After the Shivaji period, the Peshwakal singer was Ramjoshi
 anantfadi, honaji bala va prabhakar ne bhi kai powada gaae
 Later, this art lagged behind, but as folk art, Powada continued to play a role in the development of Marathi literature
 mahatma jotiba phule ne chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii samadhi dhund nikaali or 1869 main unhone puna main pehali baar shivaji maharaj kii jayanti manaai
 He got Shivaji's tomb repaired and wrote his first book 'A Ballad on Shivaji', which was recorded by the British
 phule ko yah ahsaas tha ki itihaas ke sakshi ke rup main powada kaa bahut mahatv he
 Being both lyric and prose, both entertainment and publicity are possible through Powada
 phule ne ashikshit janata ko powada ke madhyam se shivaji ke kaaryon ke bare main bataaya
 unhone maatr vyakti-aadhaarit powada nahin likhe balki upama dekar likhaa
 shivaji ke kaaryon se prerana lene ke liye unke bare main saral powada ke madhyam se ashikshit janata ko jaankaree dete the
 Later many povadas were also written against the British Raj
 yah bhi bade aashcharya kii baat he ki britishon ne hi powada ko sangrahit karne kaa kaam bhi kiya
 The biggest example is that of Harry Arbuthnot Akworth
 unhone shankar tukaraam shaaligram ke saath milakar kareeb 60 powada ikattha kiye, jinhen 1891 main ‘itihaas prasiddh purushanchi vaa striyaanche powada’ naam se prakashit kiya gaya
 After that, Akworth wrote a book called 'ballad of Maratha' in 1894
 angrejon ne shahu maharaj ke samay ke 5-6 powada khoje, 150 powada peshwa ke samay ke tathaa british kaal ke 150 powada mili
 By 1947, the British had collected more than a thousand Powars
 kai shahiron ke naam pataa nahin chale
 Dr
 SP Goswami published the initial Powaras, including Rao Barve Gyanprakash's Powaras
 in powada main british raaj ke khilaaf aakrosh prakat hua tha
 Yashwant Narasimha Kelkar published Powara in three parts, which helped to advance the Powada genre
 gondhal jati ne maharashtra ke itihaas ko bachaaya to powada ko sankalit va prakashit kar is maukhik parampara ko vilupt hone se bachaaya gaya
 Shahir literature produced many great writers including Shripad Mahadev Verde, MV Dhondh and others
 varde ne kai powada ekatrit kar unhen ‘vividhvaarta’ naam se prakashit kiya
 He also wrote a book titled 'marathi Kavitacha Ushakal Kinwa Marathi Sahitya'
 em en sahastrabuddhe kaa ‘marathi shahiri- vaganmay’ 1950 ke dashak main mumbai marathi sahitya sangh ne prakashit kiya
 All these authors played a very important role by collecting and publishing Powara
 1956 main sanyukt maharasht andolan main bhartiya communist party ne shaahir amar shaikh anna bhaau saathe tathaa gavankar ko janm diya
 All these shahiras used Powara to highlight the wrong policies and decisions of the government
 yah nae prakaar ke krantikari powada the, jo janajagriti paidaa kar rahe the
 These Powars were neither religious nor monarchical, but they were bringing out the demands of the people
 ye mazdooron kii samasyayon va akaal kaa chithran the, ve garibon kii jubaan the
 He was depicting social problems of modern times
 shaahir samaaj main vyaapt shoshan, anyaay va atyaachaar ke bare main powada ga rahe the
 Now Powada was no longer merely a description of history, but was connected to the problems of ordinary people
 aaj vishyon kii vividhta powada main dikhaai detii he
 In the 1980s, Vilas Ghogre and G
 Sambhaji Bhagat carried forward the tradition of Annabhau Sathe and Amar Sheikh of Maharashtra
 vampanthi andolanon kii ye log hunkaar bane
 Made the problems of workers and peasants a matter of Powara
 aaj sambhaji bhagat samrajyavaadee takaton, dharmik-sampradayik unmaadon va jati vyavastha ke viruddh tathaa navajanwaadee saanskrithik ekta ke liye va ambedakarwaadi - marxvaadi vichaardhaara ko failaane ke liye powada gaate hai

 bich main kuch samay ke liye is patrika kii nirantarata baadhit bhi hui thi tathaa isaki aavartita main bhi parivartan hua tha
 Generally it has been a monthly magazine, but from 1993 to '94, due to its series of epics focused on story, poetry, criticism and women's writing, it also suffered significant financial losses and disrupted continuity
 april '93 ke baad 8 maheene tak is masik patrika kaa koi ank nahin aa paaya tha
 Then its 'criticism Special' was published in the December 1993 issue
 san 1994 ke bhi ant main janvari-disambar '94 ank ke rup main iskaa 'mahila lekhan visheshank' prakashit hua
 Its publication was interrupted in 1995

 In the words of Bharat Bhardwaj, "even though the series of great writers, specials published last year has broken the economic back of the current literature, the frequency of the magazine has also changed, the magazine has reached its original point of origin, but not the magazine
 The tone has changed and not the editorial selection vision
 str bhi barkaraar he
 


 'current literature' is still one of the best three short stories in Hindi

 samudr manthan ek prasiddh hindu dharmpuranic katha he
 This story comes in the Bhagavata Purana, Mahabharata and Vishnu Purana
 shri shukdev ji bole, "he rajan! raja bali ke rajya main daitya, asur tathaa daanav ati prabal ho uthe the
 He had the power of Shukracharya
 isi bich durvasa rishi ke shaap se devraj indra shaktiheen ho gayi the
 The kingdom of the demon king Bali was on all three worlds
 indra sahit devatagan usase bhaybheet rahete the
 Only Baikunthanath Vishnu could tell the solution of this situation, so all the gods along with Brahma reached Lord Narayana
 unki stuti karke unhone bhagwaan vishnu ko apni vipadaa sunai
 Then God said in sweet voice that this is a time of crisis for you
 daityon, asuron evam daanvon kaa abhyutthan ho rahaa he or tum logon kii avnati ho rahi he
 But the crisis period should be spent in a friendly manner
 tum daityon se mitrataa kar lo or ksheer sagar ko math kar usamen se amrit nikaal kar paan kar lo
 With the help of the demons, this work will be done smoothly
 is kaary ke liye unki har shart maan lo or ant main apana kaam nikaal lo
 By drinking nectar you will become immortal and you will have the ability to kill the demons
 "bhagwaan ke aadeshaanusaar indra ne samudr manthan se amrit nikalne kii baat bali ko bataaya
 The demon king Bali compromised with Devraj Indra and got ready for churning the sea
 mandarachal parvat ko mathni tathaa vasuki naag ko neti banaaya gaya
 The leader emerged from Vasuki's eye
 swayan bhagwaan shri vishnu kacchap avatar lekar mandarachal parvat ko apane peeth par rakhkar uskaa aadhaar ban gayi
 Lord Narayana exerted power demonically in the demons and devoutly in the gods
 vasuki naag ko bhi gahan nidra de kar uske ksht ko har liya
 The god began to hold Vasuki Nag on his face
 is par ulti buddhi vaale daitya, asur, daanavaadi ne sochaa ki vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney main avashya kuch na kuch laabh hoga
 He told the gods that we are not inferior in power to anyone, we will take the place of mouth
 tab devataaon ne vasuki naag ke punch kii ore kaa sthaan le liya
 "the sea churning began and the Mandarachal mountain began to roam on the broad back of the Lord Kachhapa
 he rajan! samudr manthan se sabase pehle jal kaa halaahal vish niklaa
 All the gods and demons started burning with the flame of that poison and their ears began to fade
 is par sabhi ne milakar bhagwaan shankar kii prarthana kii
 On his prayer, Mahadev ji kept the poison on his palm and drank it but did not let it come down from the gorge
 us kalkut vish ke prabhaav se shiv ji kaa kanth nila pad gaya
 That is why Mahadev ji is called Neelkanth
 unki hatheli se thodaa sa vish prithvi par tapak gaya tha jise saanp, bichchhu aadi vifaille jantuon ne grahan kar liya
 "after consuming the poison by Lord Shankar, the ocean churning started again
 doosraa ratna kamdhenu gaay nikali jise rishiyon ne rakh liya
 Then a high horse came out which was kept by Daityaraja Bali
 uske baad airavat hathi niklaa jise devraj indra ne grahan kiya
 After Airavat, Lord Vishnu kept it out of the sea of kaustubhamani
 phir kalpavriksha niklaa or rambha naamak apsara nikali
 These two were kept in heaven
 aage phir samudr ko mathne se lakshmi ji nikaleen
 Laxmi ji got married to Lord Vishnu himself
 uske baad kanya ke rup main vaaruni prakat hai jise daityon ne grahan kiya
 Then after one moon, Parijat tree and conch came out and in the end Dhanvantari Vaidya appeared after taking the nectar
 "dhanvantari ke haath se amrit ko daityon ne chin liya or uske liye aapas main hi ladane lage
 The gods did not have the power to curse Durvasa so that they could fight the demons and take that nectar, so they stood frustrated and watched them fight among themselves
 devataaon kii niraashaa ko dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu tatkaal mohini rup dhaaran kar aapas main ladate daityon ke paas ja pahunche
 Seeing that Vishwamohini form, what is the matter of the demons and the Gods, the Brahmins, the devouring Kamdev himself, Lord Shankar too were fascinated and looked at him again and again
 jab daityon ne us navyauvana sundari ko apni ore aate huye dekha tab ve apana sara jhagada bhul kar usee sundari kii ore kamaskt hokar ekatak dekhne lage
 The monster said, "oh beautiful! Who are you? Looks like we are being sarcastic on us only to settle our dispute
 aao shubhage! tumhaara swaagat he
 Make us beautiful and make this nectar with lotus
 " is par vishwamohini rupi vishnu ne kaha, "he devataaon or daanvon! aap donon hi maharishi kashyap ji ke putr hone ke kaaran bhai-bhai ho phir bhi paraspar ladate ho
 i am an arbitrary woman
 budhimaan log aisi stri par kabhi vishwaas nahin karte, phir tum log kaise mujh par vishwaas kar rahe ho? acha yahi he ki swayan sab mil kar amritpan kar lo
 " vishwamohini ke aise niti kushal vachan sun kar un kamandh daityo, daanvon or asuron ko us par or bhi vishwaas ho gaya
 He said, "beautiful! We have full faith in you
 tum jis prakaar baantogi ham usee prakaar amritpan kar lenge
 Take this event and distribute nectar among all of us
 " vishwamohini ne amrit ghat lekar devataaon or daityon ko alag-alag panktiyo main baithne ke liye kaha
 After that, the demons plastered with their sarcasm and began to make nectar to the gods
 daitya unke kataaksh se aise madahosh huye ki amrit pinaa hi bhul gayi
 God considered this trick as a monster named Rahu
 vah devtaa kaa rup bana kar devataaon main jaakar baith gaya or praapt amrit ko mukh main daal liya
 When the nectar reached its gorge, the moon and the sun called out and said that it is Rahu monster
 yah sunakar bhagwaan vishnu ne tatkaal apane sudarshan chakra se uskaa sir gardan se alag kar diya
 Due to the effect of nectar, his head and torso became two planets named Rahu and Ketu and were established in space

 Once Akbar was called by the emperor, he had to go to Fatehpur Sikri where he was respected
 par iskaa inhen baraabar khed hi rahaa, jaisaa ki inke is pad se vyanjit hota he- It is estimated that Kumbhandas was born to Chaitra Krishna Ekadashi in Samvat 1525 Vikrami in a village named Jamunavatto, Govardhan, Mathura
 ve gorwa kshatriya the
 His father was a simple man
 kheti karke jeevika chalaate the
 Kumbhandas also believed in paternal instinct and he liked the life of the farmer
 parsoli main vishesh rup se kheti kaa kaary chalata tha
 Lack of money kept knocking him for a lifetime, but he did not spread his hand in front of anyone
 bhagavadbhakti hi unki sampatti thi
 His family was very large, he followed it with income from farming
 parivaar main inaki patni ke atirikt saat putr, saat putr-vadhuen or ek vidhwaa bhatiji thi
 Kumbhandas was the ultimate Bhagavadbhakta, an ideal householder and a great defender
 ve ni:sprut, tyaagi or mahasantoshi vyakti the
 The unique, supernatural character of the new character was that God would appear with him and play sports with him
 mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ji unke diksha-guru the
 In the 1550 Vikrami, during the time of Acharya's goverment visit, he took Brahmasabandha
 unke diksha-kaal ke pandrah saal purv shrinath ji kii murti prakat hui thi, acharya kii ajna se ve shrinath ji kii seva karne lage the
 Even after being appointed as Kirtankar in the temple of Dixit and Shrinathji in 'pushtimarg', he did not give up his instinct and continued to maintain his family till the end
 shrinath ji ke mandir main kumbhandas nity naye pad gaakar sunaane lage
 He was given the service of kirtan only when he joined the 'confirmation community'
 kumbhandas bhagawatkrupa ko hi sarvopari maanate the, bade-se-bade gharelu sankat main bhi ve apane aasthaa-path se kabhi vichlit nahin hue
 Shrinath ji had a special interest in the creation of posts related to makeup

 "kumbhandas, by the grace of Mahaprabhu, was thrilled and said," i desperately need this juice
 " After Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya's Leela-entry, Kumbhandas Gosain started singing Leela under the patronage of Vittal Nath

 The great kings and emperors used to consider their good fortune in seeing Adi Kumbhandas
 vrindavan ke bade-bade rasik or sant mahatma unke satsang kii utkrisht ichha kiya karte the
 He kept the fame of Bhagavadkti intact, never let it be tarnished by economic crisis and humiliation
 ek baar shrivitthalanath ji unhen apni dwarka yatra main saath le janaa chaahate the, unka vichaar tha ki vaishnavon kii bhent se unki aarthik paristhiti sudhar jaaygi
 Kumbhandas could not tolerate Srinathji's separation even for a moment, but he did not oppose Gosainji's orders
 ve gosai ji ke saath apsara kund tak hi gayi the ki shrinath ji ke saundarya samaran se unke ang-ang sihar uthe, bhagwaan kii madhur-madhur mand muskaan kii jyotsna virah-andhkaar main thirak uthi, maadhuryasamraat nandanandan kii virah vednaa se unka hriday ghayal ho chalaa
 He sang a verse in the disconnection of Shrinathji- shrigosai ji ke hriday par unke is virah geet kaa bada prabhaav padaa
 He did not want Kumbhandas to stay away from Shrinathji even for a moment
 kumbhandas ko unhone lautaa diya
 Kumbhandas became healthy after seeing Shrinath Jika
 ek baar mogul badshaah akbar kii rajsabha main ek gayak ne kumbhandas kaa pad gaaya
 The emperor, attracted by that position, called Kumbhandas to Fatehpur Sikri
 pehle to kumbhandas janaa nahin chaahate the, par sainik or duuton kaa vishesh aagrah dekhakar ve paidal hi gayi
 The assembly member of Shrinathji felt that Akbar's majesty was of two kinds
 kumbhandas kii pagadi fatty hui thi, taniya maili thi, ve aatmaglani main dub rahe the ki kis paap ke falswaroop unhen inke saamne upasthit hona padaa
 The emperor paid him a large tribute, but Kumbhandas felt that someone had brought him to hell
 ve sochane lage ki rajsabha se to kahin uttam braj he, jisamen swayan shrinath ji khelte rahete hai, anekon kridaayen karte karte rahete hai
 Akbar prayed to sing the verse
 kumbhandas to bhagwaan shrikrishna ke aishwarya-maadhurya ke kavi the, unhone pad-gaan kiya- The king was gentle, he respectfully sent him home
 samvath 1620 vikrami main maharaj maansingh braj aaye the
 He visited Govardhan after seeing Vrindavan

 At that time, Kumbhandas ji was performing Kirtan with Mridang and Veena
 raja maansingh unki pad-gaan style se bahut prabhavit hue
 He went to meet them in Jamunavato
 kumbhandas kii deen-hin dasha dekhakar ve chakit ho uthe
 Kumbhandas was meditating in the form of God
 aankh khulne par unhone bhatiji se asana or darpan maange, uttar mila ki ‘asana padiya kha gayi, darpan bhi pi gayi
 It meant that he used to do tilak after seeing the face in the water
 maharaja maansingh ko unki nirdhantaa kaa pataa lag gaya
 He wanted to give a mirror of gold, the devotee of God declined, the bag of pieces, the servant of the Vishwapati ignored him
 chalate samay maansingh ne jamanuvato gaanv kumbhandas ke naam karnaa chaha, par unhone kaha ki "meraa kaam to kareel ke ped or ber ke vriksh se hi chal jaataa he
 "king Mansingh praised his disinterestedness and renunciation, he said that" i have seen many devotees of Maya, but you are the real God
 " Even in old age, Kumbhandas used to come to Govardhan to visit Srinath ji regularly from Jamunavato
 ek din sankarshan kundi par anyodar ke nikat ve thahar gayi
 Chaturbhuj Das, the famous poet of 'ashtachhap', was accompanied by his younger son
 unhone chaturbhujadas se kaha ki "ab ghar chalakar kya karnaa he
 After some time the body is going to leave
 " gosai vitthalanath ji unke dehavsaan ke samay upasthit the
 Gosain ji asked that "in which time is the mind engaged?" Kumbhandas said- sung the verse in view of the image of Lal Teri Chitwan Chithi Churavai and its inter-couple form- unhone sharir chhod diya
 Gosain ji paid tribute to Karun Swar that such a Bhagwadiya endowment had taken place

 When Kennedy was contesting the presidential election in 1960, his main issue was the "missile gap" from the alleged leading Russia
 Whereas, in fact, the United States was ahead of the Soviet Union

 On Thursday morning at 8:30 EST, Bundy met with Kennedy and showed him the pictures taken from U-2 and informed them of the cia's analysis of those photos
 At 6:30 pm EST Kennedy called a meeting of nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisors, after the fact of the October 22 of the National Security Action Memorandum 196, he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council into a group
 Declared

 unka maananaa tha ki cuba par vijay praapt karne se yues ko rokane kaa prayaas soviet sangh nahin karegaa
 Kennedy was confused
 They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something
 They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing
 If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin
 Kennedy thought that airstrikes on Cuba would lead the Soviets to believe that a signal of "a green signal" had been given to subjugate Berlin
 kennedy kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki america ke sahyogi yah sochenge ki cuba sthiti kaa shantipurna samaadhaan nahin nikaal paane ke kaaran "yuddh-premi coubwoy" ke rup main berlin ne yues ko ganvaa diya

 The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed the missiles would severely change the military balance, but Defense Secretary Robert mcnamara disagreed
 He was sure that the missiles would not affect the strategic balance at all
 He said that the extra forty would not affect the overall strategic balance
 The US already had about 5,000 strategic explosive heads, while the Soviet Union had only 300
:261, he said, so the strategic balance was not going to change fundamentally as the Soviet Union had 340
 In 1990 he reiterated that "it did not make any difference
" 

sainya santulan nahin badla tha
 i still didn't believe and i still don't
 " exom sahamat tha, haalanki, mixilon se raajnneetik santulan prabhavit ho rahaa tha
 First, Kennedy made a clear promise to the American public a month before the crisis that "if endowed with the capacity to take aggressive action against America
"

 After the crisis, Kennedy said that "this would have changed the balance of power politically
 There was an impression and that perception contributed to reality
" ":889-904 On Thursday, October 18, President Kennedy met Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromico, who claimed that the weapons were for defensive purposes only

 Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Anderson wrote a position document that helped Kennedy differentiate between the quarantine of offensive weapons and the blockade of all materials, indicating that a conventional blockade was not originally intended
 chunki yah antarrashtriya jal main hone vaala tha, isliye raashtrapati kennedy rio sandhi ke golarddh raksha praavdhaanon ke tahat sainya karrwai karne ke liye oees se anumodan praapt kiya
 Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the US Commander South Atlantic at Trinidad on 9 November
 An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required
 In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers and one submarine had reported to COSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2
 The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the quarantine
 The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship
 Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the US to discuss this assistance
 The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the quarantine operation
 This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty

 While a new message from Khrushchev began to arrive at 11:03 am EST while the meeting was going on, part of the message said, You are disturbed over Cuba
 You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America
 But


 you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us

 At 4:00 pm EST, Kennedy again called Exom members at the White House and ordered that a message be immediately sent to u Thant to tell the Soviet to "suspend" missile action while negotiations were underway
 During this meeting, Maxwell Taylor reported that U-2 had been shot down
 kennedy ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki agar hamalaa hua to ve un sthalon par hamale kaa aadesh denge, lekin unhone tay kiya ki ve aisa tab tak nahin karenge jab tak ki duusari baar hamalaa nahin hota
 After 40 years, mcnamara said in an interview: We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational
 We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict
 And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack
 It was shot down on Friday 
 Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought "well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack
" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation
 And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2
 Messengers were sent by Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev on Saturday evening of October 27 in Washington D

 Unbeknownst to most of Exom's members, Robert Kennedy held a meeting with the USSR ambassador in Washington to get a sense of the intentions
 aamtaur par exom is prastaav ke khilaaf tha, kyonki isse nato kaa prabhutv kamjor hota or turki sarkaar ne baar-baar kaha tha ki yah aise kisi bhi kaary-vyapaar ke khilaaf tha

 Fomin and Scally reunite at Juan Brito's request
 scally ne poocha ki khrushchev ke do patr itane alag kyon hai, to fomin ne daawa diya ki "kharaab sampreshan" ke kaaran aisa hua hoga
 Scally replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was "a useless deception"
 They went on to say that the invasion was now only a matter of a few hours, at which point Fomin said that Khrushchev was expected to respond to the US message and asked Skalie to tell the State Department Urged that there was no intention of deceit
 scally ne kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki koi is par vishwaas karegaa, lekin ve sandesh de dene ke liye sahamat ho gaye
 The two went their separate paths and Scali immediately typed a memo for Exom

 Khrushchev's new message was broadcast on Moscow radio at 9:00 am EDT on Monday October 20
 khrushchev ne kaha ki, "soviet sarkaar ne, harthiyaaron nirmaan sthalon par kaam band karne ke pehle ke jari nirdesh ke alaava, jise aap 'aakraamak' bataate hai, un hathiyaaron ko nasht karne or unhen patiband karke soviet sangh waapas laane kaa ek nayaa aadesh bhi jari kiya he
 Kennedy immediately issued a statement describing it as "an important and constructive step towards peace

 In his agreement with the US Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the Soviet Ambassador Antoine Dobranin informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey be lifted "within a few days of the end of the crisis"
: 222 Last US The missiles were disassembled by 24 April 1963, and were sent out of Turkey shortly thereafter

 It is possible that Khrushchev had placed missiles in Cuba only to have Kennedy withdraw missiles from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets had no intention of going to the asylum of nuclear war; Provided they are shot and killed by Americans
 However, since the withdrawal of Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in southern Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time, Khrushchev appeared to be losing the conflict and weakened
 dharna yah bani ki mahashaktiyon ke bich kii ladaai main kennedy jeet gaye or khrushchev apamaanit ho gaye
 However, this case is not entirely correct as both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avert complete conflict despite pressure from their own governments
 Khrushchev remained in power for the next two years
 :102-105 The agreement was particularly embarrassing for Khrushchev and the Soviet Union, as the withdrawal of American missiles from Italy and Turkey was not made public - it was a secret agreement between Kennedy and Khrushchev
 soviet sangh un paristhitiyon se peeche hatataa hua najar aa rahaa tha jisaki shuruuaat unalogon ne kii thi - haalanki ise agar thik dhang se nibhaayaa gaya hota to ise vipareet rup main dekha ja saktaa tha
 Two years after Khrushchev withdrew from power, he may have had a partial stake in the Politburo's embarrassment, both for his potential concession to the US and his inability to be oblivious to the crisis at the right time
