 You know that the main company is finmanica and the agustawestland subsidiary

 In February 2013, the Italian police arrested Finmacanica chairman Orci
 charge lagaaya gaya ki oresi ne dallalon ko 360 karod rupee diye hai taaki ve bharat ke saath helicopter kii bikri ko sunishchit karvaa saken
 In February 2012, when the news of the investigation in Italy came, the then Defense Minister orders an inquiry
 italy main to 2011 ke saal se hi is tarah kii charchaa hone lagi thi
 According to the 'hindu' newspaper, it appeared on 17 February 2013 that India had sought documents related to the case from Italy, but the Italian court rejected New Delhi's demand

 Meanwhile, Manu Pabbi, reporting on the Augusta Westland case from the year 2012, goes from 'indian Express' to 'economic Times'
 manu pabi 9 april ko 'iconomik times' main khabar chhapate hai
 The High Court judgment states that 10 million euros was given to Tyagi Brothers in exchange for this deal
 iskaa kuch hissaa purv vayusena pramukh air marshall espi tyaagi ko bhi mila he
 There are enough indications of this
 do bichauliye heske or gerosa kii baatcheet kii ricarding se sanket miltaa he ki tyaagi kii bhoomika ko chupaane kii bhi koshish hui
 Who was trying to save Tyagi
 lekin kya es pi tyaagi ne helicopter kii ceiling main badlaav kar agasta westland ko laabh pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya
 On the basis of what i have understood, the Italian court has said that the accused party had initially made a significant allegation that Tyagi had weakened the terms of flight sealing so that Augusta would benefit
 adaalat maanati he ki iske bare main koi saboot nahin he
 SP Tyagi is also facing this charge in the Indian media
 magar italy kii adaalat ne saaf kaha he ki unhone galat kiya, iske saboot nahin milte, magar iske sanket milte hai ki paisa mila hoga
 One thing to be noted is that the government agencies do not have a copy of the 225-page judgment copy
 italian main likhe panne ke kuch hisse kaa anuwaad kisi ne kiya he to kuch log google transleshan kii madad le rahe hai
 The Defense Minister has said to get the translation done
 zaahir he is maamle main jo bhi kaha ja rahaa he faisle kii copy ko bina puraa padhe hi kaha ja rahaa he
 There may be nothing wrong, but it may be that the image of the person being named is smeared forever

 At the time when we talked to him, he said, "I retired in 2007 and this contract has been signed in 2010, so why would anyone give me a bribe?" ' tab maine poocha ki tender final to aapke vaayu sena pramukh rahete hue tha
 Then Tyagi said that i was the Chief of the Air Force when the tender was issued in 2006, but the process started in 2000
 tab raksha mantri jorge furnandis siachin jaaya karte the or aise ek helicopter kii zarurat thi jo 18000 feet ke neeche chalaa jaae jisamen ve ai pi ja saken
 At that time, i had asked clearly whether anyone had put political pressure on you
 tyaagi ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki koi dabaav nahin daalaa gaya tha
 Rather it said that the government does not put any pressure
 wo apane jawaab main kehete rahe ki badlaav raksha mantralay se hota he
 Air Force Headquarters may suggest
 badal nahin saktaa
 In 2013, Tyagi was clearly saying that the government was doing a fairly straightforward and clean job
 ab kya kahana he sarkaar ke bare main maaloom nahin magar pehle kii tarah ab bhi ve yahi kah rahe hai ki jo bhi badlaav hua wo raksha mantralay ke str par hua
 The Italian court has also said in its judgment that there is no evidence that Tyagi benefited agustawestland by changing the terms of flight sealing
 jab italy kii nichali adaalat ne unhen aarope mukt kiya tha tab tab hamaare raksha sampadak nitin gokhale se baat karte hue vayusena ke purv pramukh es ke tyaagi ne kaha tha ki dedh saal se tanaav main tha
 i have won lekin jab isi maheene milan ke hoicourt ne nichali adaalat kaa faisla palat kar yah kah diya ki tyaagi ko rishwat di gai he to hamaare sahyogi rajeev ranjan unke paas gaye
 SK Tyagi said that the copy of the verdict has not been received, so it would not be right to say anything
 air chif marshall ko rishwat kii rakam di gai he, yah aarope utani hi sharmnaak he jitani bhartiya netaaon kii rishwat diye jane kii baat
 It is important for the morale and image of the Air Force that the outcome of the investigation in SP Tyagi's case should come quickly
 khabar he ki pratyrpan nideshaalay unase poochtacha karne vaala he
 You might be thinking that this case will also be challenged in the Supreme Court of Italy
 ho saktaa he di jaae, magar vahaan kaa supreme court cese ke tathyon or sabooton par dobaaraa se vichaar nahin karata he
 The Supreme Court will only conduct a legal review
 2012 main jab yah maamla uthaa tha uske duusare din hi raksha mantralay ne italy ke duutavas se tathyon kaa pataa lagane kaa aadesh diya tha
 On 12 February 2013, the Ministry of Defense hands over the case to the CBI
 janvari 2014 main bharat ne deal cancil kar di
 Three helicopters of Augusta were confiscated
 bharat ne guarantee ke rup main agasta ko jo paise diye the use jabt kar liya
 The CBI and the Extradition Directorate are also investigating in India
 sibiai ne kaha he ki bharat kii taraf se jaanch kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa he
 The statements of all the witnesses have been recorded
 aath deshon main letters aaf rogetary bheja gaya he
 This letter is written to the courts of other countries for cooperation
 abhi tak italy, british virgin island, euke, tunisia se jawaab aa gaya he
 Right now we are reading the information coming from there
 kathith bichauliya maaikel ke khilaaf red carnor notice jari kar diya he
 The CBI is also saying that informal copies of the verdict have been got translated
 raksha mantralay bhi anuwaad kara rahaa he
 The Ministry of Defense has said that it will take seven to eight days to translate
 sochiye 225 pej ke anuwaad main haftaa lagegaa to 90 hazaar pannon ke anuwaad main kitna vakt laga hoga, agar anuwaad ho gaya hoga to
 About which i am not aware
 sibiai ne bich main tyaagi bros se poochtacha kii he
 Everyone has seen a bank record of 10-12 years
 air marshall es pi tyaagi se pehle bhi poochtacha ho chuki he or pratyrpan nideshaalay ne kaha he ki phir poochtacha hogi
 It is said that even the CBI has not found strong evidence that money has come to them or not
 espi tyaagi ke bhai rajeev tyaagi kahana he ki agasta westland ke tender se lekar deal hone tak paanch air chif hue, chaar raksha sachiv aae or chale gaye
 Two National Security Advisers came and went
 do raksha mantri bhi aae or chale gaye
 Pranab Mukherjee and AK Antony
 itane logon ke kya sirf es pi tyaagi kaa hi naam kyon aayaa
 Rajiv Tyagi is asking if Air Marshal SP Tyagi was the only one in the process
 yahi nahin deal ke dauraan do pradhanmantri ho gaye
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh
 rajeev tyaagi kaa kahana he ki vaajapeyi kaal main hi helicopter ke udaan kii oonchai 6000 meter se ghataakar 4500 kiya gaya
 Before Augusta, another helicopter was selected EC 225 It could fly up to 6000 meters only
 us samay sochaa gaya ki aisa helicopter ek hi company banaati he, lihaaza sawaal na khadaa ho jaae ki ek hi company ko jaanboojh kar tender main bulaayaa gaya, isliye piemo ne suzav diya ki kam oonchai par udne vaale helicopter par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 i am telling you the information related to agustawestland on the site of the Ministry of Defense
 antni ke samay se hi vahaan he or parrikar ke samay main yahi jaankaree he
 According to the Ministry of Defense, on 19 November 2003, the Principal Secretary held a meeting with the Prime Minister
 vahiin faisla hua ki udaan kii oonchai 4500 kar di jaae
 This was done because these changes would allow many companies to participate in the tender
 iske baad hi agasta westland deal kii prakriya main pravesh karata he
 He is accompanied by three more companies
 do companiyaan prakriya kii shuruuaat main hi baahar ho jaati hai or do batch jaati hai- agasta or sikroski
 There was an Integrity Clause in this deal, according to which any bribery case will come up, not only will the deal be canceled, but the money that has been paid will also be confiscated
 sikroski company ne is claaj par sin karne se manaa kar diya or wo is prakriya se baahar ho gai
 Agreed with agustawestland
 dallali kii baat saamne aate hi bharat sarkaar ne sauda radd kar diya or paisa bhi zabt kar liya
 Rs 1567 crore was paid, but more than that was recovered by India from the company
 magar in baton se yah nahin pataa chalata ki kisne rishwat lee
 The Italian court has proved the bribe
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi rishwat diye jane kii baat maani he tabhi to sauda radd kiya gaya or paisa vasula gaya
 The question is who took the bribe
 yah baat na vahaan se pataa chalati he na yahaan se
 It has been proved that the murder has happened, but whose murder is not known
 aadesh kaa ricard dekhenge to kisi bhi sarkaar kaa ricard karaab nahin he
 If you ask the result, you will not get a record
 jab se yah khabar 'iconomik times' main chhapi he tab se bhartiya janata party aakraamak he
 The BJP says that the Italian court has decided
 media main yah khabar pehle chhapi he isliye us par badale kii karrwai kaa aarope lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 It is another matter that the Modi government is being asked when the outcome of the investigation going on in India will be seen
 'iconomik times' ne likhaa he ki faisle main cinyoraa gandhi kaa naam chaar baar aayaa he
 Investigators have received a letter from middleman Christian Mitchell, indicating that Sinora Gandhi was the main force behind the deal
 italian main cinyoraa kaa matlab shrimati hota he
 Another middleman has identified the picture of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi in the court
 kai saare bichauliyon se zabt note main congress ke kuch sadasyon kii taraf ishaara ho rahaa he
 There are also indications of the role of bureaucrats and the rights of the Indian Air Force
 sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki koi saboot nahin he
 She is not afraid of anyone
 modi sarkaar do saal se kya kar rahi thi
 On Wednesday, Suhasini Haider and Josie Joseph of 'hindu' newspaper interviewed middleman Christian Mitchell
 yah ek baar giraftaar ho chukaa he
 It has told the Hindu newspaper that i have never met Sonia Gandhi, nor in any hotel or any party
 bhagya kii baat he ki nahin mila hum
 If i had met, i would have said that i have discussed something
 na maine phone kiya he, na email kiya he, na letters likhaa he, na massej kiya he
 He is not even named in any memo
 yah sawaal vaazib bhi he ki kya congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bina yaa upie sarkaar ke sheersh mantriyon ke bina yah deal ho sakati thi
 If a bribe has been given, it would have been given at the behest of someone, it would have been taken
 yah baat tabhi saamne aegi jab isaki pukhta jaanch hogi
 From that time too
 manmohan singh, ahamed patel or auskar furnandis ke alaava upie ke vakt enese rahe emke narayanan kaa bhi naam he
 From Sonia Gandhi to Ahmed Patel, all the allegations have been denied
 bijepi ne kaha he ki kam se kam sonia gandhi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisale kaa sammaan to karnaa hi chahie
 Congress has also asked 10 questions
 is maamle main ek or pahalu he
 The same James Christian Mitchell told the 'hindu' newspaper that three different sources told me that there was a meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Italy in New York
 italian marine cese maamle main bharat ke pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan diya ki ve italy kii madad kar sakate hai agar helicopter saude main gandhi parivaar ko fansaane kaa koi saboot mil jaae to
 The Hindu newspaper asked if there was any evidence that the meeting had taken place
 mishael ne kaha ki na sirf mulaakaat hui he, balki itani der chal mulaakaat chali ki donon ko apni duusari baithkon ke samay main badlaav karnaa padaa tha
 When all this was happening, the ambassadors had told that the two were meeting
 mishael ne 'hindu' akhbaar se poocha ki kya unhone likhit rup main diya he ki mulaakaat nahin
 The news about this meeting was published in the newspaper 'the Telegraph' originating from Kolkata on 2 February 2016
 mishael ne antarrashtriya tribunel court ko likhaa tha ki donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich mulaakaat hui he or bharat ke pradhanmantri ne peshkash kii he ki agar gandhi parivaar ke bare main kuch saboot mil jaae to marine vivaad ko sulajhaa denge
 The case of two marines arrested in India is going on between Italy and India in the International Tribunal Court
 jis vakt khabar chhapi thi ki ye itani bakawaas baat he ki coment karnaa bhi bekaar he
 This time also when this matter arose, the Ministry of External Affairs repeated the same thing
 sadan main vitt mantri ne bhi kaha ki aisi koi mulaakaat nahin hui he
 Political allegations are being made
 bijepi ne congress ko gher to liya he lekin kya baat raajnneeti se bhi aage badhegi
 In this case, there is no official status report of inquiry and there is no such report
 log chaahate hai ki jo bhi doshi he wo jaldi pakadaa jaae
 It should not happen that after Ishrat, the builder, after the cheating of the builders, Augusta, after Augusta, some other issue will come and it all becomes a nura wrestling
 ab ek maamla he agasta westland ko blike list karne kaa
 As soon as AK Antony said that he was blacklisted during his tenure, Defense Minister Manohan Parrikar challenged that the documents be shown if done
 parrikar media ke saamne aae or bataa diya ki e ke antni ke samay helicopter company ko bain nahin kiya gaya tha
 Soon after Parrikar's clarification, AK Antony came down from the black list and started talking about starting the process
 ab dekhiye
 There is a difference between starting and banning the process
 e ke antni agar tezi se se jaanch karte to ye naubat nahin aati
 The Congress then started asking why agustawestland / Finnamica was made a part of Make in India despite objections? Why did the Modi government allow agustawestland and Tata's joint venture to make helicopters? Why agustawestland was allowed to bid for 100 Naval Utility Helicopters in April 2015? bijepi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisle se nai urja mili he ki iske zariye sonia gandhi ko bhrashtachar ke maamle main sidhe sidhe gheraa ja saktaa he
 Sonia Gandhi may be asking for proof but politics does not wait for proof
 sahi he ki faisle kii puri copy abhi tak nahin padhi gai he
 India's favor was not kept there but it is also a fact that bribe has been given in the agustawestland case
 dene kii baat sabit ho chuki he
 Except this question, the Congress is trying to surround the BJP through other questions
 sawaal to banate hai magar rishwat vaale sawaal ke jawaab ke rup main nahin
 The Congress says that chopper has been taken from Agusta in Chhattisgarh too
 sieji kii report ne kaha he ki 2007 main 65
 Documents for this purchase of US $ 7 million were prepared in such a way that no company other than agustawestland was involved in the procurement process
 yah baat congress abhi kyon kah rahi he
 Why did not you constantly lift
 tippaniyan Diwakar Anand of the 'DNA' newspaper wrote that on 10 February 2014, the Ministry of Defense started the process of blacklisting agustawestland and Finmanica
 inke saath hue saare qaraar par roak laga di thi
 On August 28, 2014, a new policy order comes in how to treat such a company
 is aadesh main likhaa tha ki koi kaaran nahin he ki finamaikanika group ke saath hue qaraar ke saath aage na badha jaae
 The same order stated that Finmacanica and allies would be excluded from the new tender
 nae tender se alag bhi rakhana he or puraane qaraar ko jari bhi rakhana he
 Is there a complete ban
 kya is sawaal kaa jawaab antim rup se mil gaya he
 The same thing appeared in 'times of India' on 11 February 2014
 kai jaankaar kah rahe hai ki finamaikanika ko blike list karnaa aasaan nahin he
 On 3 April, Financial Express reported that the Indian government had allowed agustawestland to participate in the tender for 100 light utility helicopters
 shart he ki company ko kisi sthaneey vendor se saajheedaari kerani hogi
 If this is true, then where is the black list? netaa adhikari ke saath-saath yah baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki karodon rupee media manage karne ke liye bhi kharch kiye gaye
 Therefore, investigation is important not only for the Congress but also for the media
 koun koun patrkaar manage ho rahe the
 Rather, they were managing the government on behalf of the company
 aaj bhi rajya sabha main subramanyam swami kii baat ko lekar hangaamaa ho gaya
 His point was dropped from the action, but from what he heard, it seems that BJP is not going to leave the Congress on this issue
 lekin is kahasuni ke jawaab main jo kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kah gaye wo dilachasp he
 What does this mean that Naqvi has been the master of the school where the Congressmen are studying
 isaki vyakhya kai roopon main kii ja sakati he
 Do you know what they are saying that as Head Master we know a lot or what you do, we can do better than you
 24 farvari 2012 ko indian express ke samvaadadaata manu pabi khabar chhapate hai ki italy ke atarni general ne ek jaanch shuru kii
 It is alleged that brokerage is being signed in the deal signed by Finnycanyika, the company of Itni, which has signed a deal with India for 3500 crores
 aap jaanate hai ki main company finamaikanika he or agasta westland sahaayak company he
 finmacanica is an Italian public sector type company
 farvari 2013 main italian police ne finamaikanika ke chairman oresi ko giraftaar kiya
 It was alleged that Orsi had given Rs 360 crore to the brokers to ensure the sale of helicopters with India
 farvari 2012 main italy main jaanch kii khabar aate hi tab ke raksha mantri jaanch ke aadesh de dete hai
 In Italy, this kind of discussion started from the year of 2011
 'hindu' akhbaar ke anusaar 17 farvari 2013 ko chhapi ki bharat ne italy se is maamle se jude dastauez maange the, lekin italy kii adaalat ne nai dilli kii maang ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Later in 2013, the Italian court handed over 90 thousand pages of documents to Indian agencies
 2013 se 2016 ke bich kitne pannon kaa anuwaad hua maaloom nahin
 i cannot even tell how many people have been engaged in the translation of thousands of pages and whether this work is happening on a war footing or is going on like slow news
 2013 main sibiai kii jaanch bharat main shuru ho jaati he
 In February 2013, the UPA government also passed a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to form a JPC, but the JPC was not formed, as all the opposing parties objected
 je di you kaa kahana tha ki vipaksh kaa netaa is sanyukt sansadeey samiti kaa adhyaksh hoga to bijepi kaa kahana tha ki supreme court kii nigaraanee main jaanch honi chahie
 Is the investigation under the supervision of the Supreme Court right now? We do not know
 kul milakar je pi si bani nahin
 Then AK Antony as defense minister made a statement which would be interesting to know here
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki ham kuch nahin kar rahe hai lekin italy kii nyaaypalika he, jo italy kii sarkaar se swatantra he, wo puraa cese dekh rahi he
 Our investigation is in the initial stage, their investigation is in the final stages
 italy main chal rahi jaanch kaa jo bhi parinaam hoga wo aa jayega
 In the meantime, the times of governments have changed, but our investigative agency feels that the initial phase has fascinated
 italy kii hoicourt kaa faisalaa bhi aa gaya
 As AK Antony, Italy's judiciary is independent of the government there, then there should not be any objection to the decision of that independent judiciary
 unheen kaa bayaan he
 BJP government has come
 bijepi ke mantri bhi usee italy kii nyaaypalika kii kasam kha rahe hai jisaki kabhi antni ji kha rahe the
 In October 2014, a lower court in Italy acquitted former Air Force chief SP Tyagi from all charges
 indian express ne likhaa he ki finamaikanika ke chairman oresi or pramukh branuso speganolini ko antarrashtriya bhrashtachar ke aaropon se mukt kar diya gaya, lekin farzi bill banane kaa aarope lagaate hue do saal kii sazaa suna di
 The High Court of Milan overturned this order, ruling that Orsi and Spageloni had bribed Indian officials to get the contract
 kya italy kii adaalat ne purv vayusena pramukh es ke tyaagi ke bare main koi tippanee kii he
 According to the 'economic Times' report of April 9, it has been proved in the Milan High Court that the Rs 3565 crore agustawestland contract, signed in 2010, has been bribed to Indian authorities
 iske alaava finamaikanika ke do bade adhikariyon ko antarrashtriya bhrashtachar or mani londring kaa doshi paaya he
 He has been sentenced to four years and both have also been fined
 is bich agasta westland ke maamle par 2012 ke saal se reporting karne vaale manu pabi 'indian express' se 'iconomik times' chale jate hai
 Manu Pabbi publishes the news in the 'economic Times' on 9 April
 hoicourt ke faisle main likhaa he ki is deal ke badale 10 million euro tyaagi bros ko diya gaya
 Part of it has also been given to former Air Force Chief Air Marshal SP Tyagi
 is baat ke paryaapt sanket milte hai
 The recording of conversations between two middlemen Heske and Gerosa indicates that there was also an attempt to hide Tyagi's role
 koun tyaagi ko bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha
 But did SP Tyagi try to benefit agustawestland by changing the ceiling of the helicopter
 main jitna samaj sakaa hum uske aadhaar par italy kii adaalat ne yahi kaha he ki aaropee paksh ne shuru main ek mahatvapurn aarope lagaaya tha ki tyaagi ne flite ceiling kii sharton ko kamazor kiya taaki agasta ko laabh mili
 The court believes that there is no evidence about it
 es pi tyaagi par yah aarope bharat kii media main bhi lag rahaa he
 But the Italian court has clearly said that they did wrong, there is no evidence of this, but there are indications that money must have been found
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki sarkaar kii agenciyon ke paas 225 pannon ke faisle kii copy kaa anuwaad nahin he
 Some part of the page written in Italian has been translated by some, while some people are taking help of Google translation
 raksha mantri ne anuwaad karaane kii baat kahi he
 Obviously, whatever is being said in this case, the copy of the judgment is being said without reading it completely
 ho saktaa he ki kuch bhi galat nahin ho magar ho saktaa he ki jiskaa naam liya ja rahaa he uski chhavi par hameshaa ko liye dhabba lag jaae
 In February 2013, while in the Indian Express, Manu Pabi wrote the news of Augusta, in which former Air Marshal SP Tyagi's name was mentioned
 us samay jab hamane unase baat kii thi to unhone kaha tha, '2007 main main ritair hua or yah kantrect sin hua he 2010 main, isliye mujhe kyon koi rishwat degaa
 'then i asked if the tender final was while your Air Force Chief
 tab tyaagi ji ne kaha ki 2006 main tender jari hua tha tab main hi vaayu sena pramukh tha, lekin isaki prakriya shuru hui san 2000 main
 Then Defense Minister George Fernandes used to go to Siachen and needed a helicopter that could go under 18000 feet in which VIP could go
 us vakt maine saaf-saaf poocha tha ki kya aap par kisi ne raajnneetik dabaav daalaa tha
 Tyagi had clearly stated that no pressure was exerted
 balki yah kaha ki sarkaar koi pressure nahin daalati he
 He kept saying in his reply that the change comes from the Ministry of Defense
 air force mukhyalay suzav de saktaa he
 Can not change
 2013 main tyaagi ji saaf-saaf kah rahe the ki sarkaar bilkul sidhaa or saaf kaam kar rahi thi
 What to say now is not known about the government but as before, they are still saying that whatever change happened was at the level of the Ministry of Defense
 italy kii court ne bhi apane faisle main kaha he ki iske pramaan nahin milte ki tyaagi ne flite ceiling kii sharton ko badalakar agasta westland ko laabh pahunchaaya
 Talking to our Defense Editor Nitin Gokhale, former Air Force chief SK Tyagi had said that he was under stress for a year and a half when the Italian lower court acquitted him
 meri jeet hui he
 But when the High Court of Milan overturned the judgment of the lower court this month, saying that Tyagi had been bribed, our colleague Rajiv Ranjan went to him
 es ke tyaagi ne kaha ki faisle kii copy nahin mili he, isliye kuch kahana thik nahin rahegaa
 The bribe amount has been given to the Air Chief Marshal, this accusation is as shameful as the bribe of Indian leaders
 vaayu sena ke manobal or chhavi ke liye zaruri he ki es pi tyaagi ke maamle main jaanch kaa nateeja jaldi aae
 The extradition directorate is reported to be questioning him
 aap soch rahe honge ki is maamle ko italy ke supreme court main bhi chunauti di jaaegi
 It may be given, but there the Supreme Court does not reconsider the facts and evidence of the case
 supreme court sirf kanoonee samiksha karegaa
 In 2012, on the second day of when the matter came up, the Ministry of Defense ordered the Italian Embassy to find out the facts
 12 farvari 2013 ko raksha mantralay yah maamla sibiai ko saunp detaa he
 In January 2014, India canceled the deal
 agasta ke teen helicopter zabt kar liye gaye
 India confiscated the money it had given to Augusta as a guarantee
 bharat me bhi sibiai or pratyrpan nideshaalay jaanch kar rahaa he
 The CBI has said that the investigation work has been completed on behalf of India
 sabhi gavaahon ke bayaan ricard ho chuke hai
 Letter of Rogatory has been sent to eight countries
 yah patr duusare deshon kii adaalaton ko sahyog ke liye likhaa jaataa he
 So far the answer has come from Italy, British Virgin Island, UK, Tunisia
 abhi ham vahaan se ai jaankaree ko pard rahe hai dekh rahe hai
 a red corner notice has been issued against the alleged middleman Michael
 sibiai bhi kah rahi he ki anaupchaarik rup se faisle kii copy mili he uskaa anuwaad kara rahe hai
 The Ministry of Defense is also getting the translation done
 raksha mantralay ne kaha he ki saat se aath din lag jaayenge anuwaad karaane main
 Think about how long it would take for a translation of 225 pages, then how long it would have taken to translate 90 thousand pages, if it had been done
 jiske bare main mujhe jaankaree nahin he
 The CBI has interrogated Tyagi Brothers in the meantime
 sabhi kaa 10-12 saal kaa bank ricard dekh liya he
 Air Marshal SP Tyagi has also been questioned before and the extradition directorate has said that it will be questioned again
 kaha jaataa he ki sibiai ko bhi pukhta saboot nahin mili hai ki inke paas paisa aayaa he yaa nahin
 SP Tyagi's brother Rajiv Tyagi says that from the tender of agustawestland till the deal was done, five Air Chiefs, four Defense Secretaries came and went
 do rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar aae or chale gaye
 Two defense ministers also came and went
 pranab mukherjee or e ke antni
 Why did SP Tyagi name only so many people? rajeev tyaagi puch rahe hai ki kya tamaam prakriya main air marshall es pi tyaagi hi the
 Not only this, there were two Prime Ministers during the deal
 atal bihari vaajapeyi or manmohan singh
 Rajiv Tyagi says that it was during the Vajpayee period that the flight height of the helicopter was reduced from 6000 meters to 4500 meters
 agasta se pehle ek or helicopter kaa chayan hua tha i si 225 yah keval 6000 meter tak hi ud saktaa tha
 At the time it was thought that such a helicopter would form a single company, so there is no question that the same company was deliberately called in the tender, hence the PMO suggested that helicopters flying at low altitude could be considered
 raksha mantralay kii site par agasta westland se sambandhit jo jaankariyaan di gai hai usee se bataa rahaa hum
 It is there since Antony's time and this information is there in Parrikar's time
 raksha mantralay ke anusaar 19 november 2003 ke din pradhan sachiv ne pradhanmantri ke saath baithak kii
 At the same time, it was decided to increase the flight height to 4500
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki in badlaavon se kai companiyon ko tender main bhaag lene kaa mauka miltaa
 It is only after this that Augusta enters the process of the Westland deal
 uske saath teen or companiyaan hoti hai
 Two companies exit at the start of the process and two are left - Augusta and Cicrosky
 is deal main ek integrity claaj tha jiske anusaar koi bhi rishwat kaa maamla saamne aayega to na keval sauda radd hoga, balki jo paisa diya ja chukaa hoga use bhi zabt kar liya jayega
 The Sekrosky Company refused to sign the class and dropped out of the process
 agasta westland ke saath qaraar hua
 The Government of India canceled the deal and confiscated the money as soon as the brokerage was revealed
 1567 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha, lekin isse zyada kii rakam company se bharat ne vasuul lee
 But these things do not reveal who took the bribe
 italy kii adaalat ne rishwat dene kii baat sabit kii he
 The Government of India has also accepted the bribe, only then the deal was canceled and the money was recovered
 sawaal he rishwat kisne lee
 This thing is neither known from there nor from here
 qatl hua he ye sabit ho gaya he magar qatl kiskaa hua he yahi pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If we see the record of the order, then the record of any government is not bad
 nateeja puuchhenge to ricard hi nahin milegaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been aggressive ever since this news appeared in the 'economic Times'
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki italy kii adaalat kaa faisla he
 This news has appeared in the media earlier, therefore it would not be right to accuse him of retaliation
 ye or baat he ki modi sarkaar se poocha ja rahaa he ki bharat main ho rahi jaanch kaa anjaam kab dekhne ko milegaa
 The Economic Times has written that Sinyora Gandhi's name appears four times in the judgment
 bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa ek patr jaanchakartaaon ko mila he jisase pataa chalata he ki is deal ke peeche cinyoraa gandhi mukhya shakti rahi hai
 Sinoyra in Italian means Smriti
 ek or bichauliye ne adaalat main congress netaa sonia gandhi kii tasviir kii pahchaan kii he
 Some of the middlemen have been pointing to some members of the Congress in confiscated notes
 naukarshahon or bhartiya vaayu sena ke adhikaron kii bhoomika ke bhi sanket milte hai
 Sonia Gandhi has said that there is no evidence
 ve kisi se nahin daratin
 What was the Modi government doing for two years
 buudhvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar kii suhasini haidar or josi joseph ne bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa intervyuu kiya he
 It has been arrested once
 isane hindu akhbaar ko bataaya he ki main sonia gandhi se kabhi nahin mila hum, na kisi hotel yaa kisi party main
 It is a matter of luck that i have not been found
 mila hota to kehete ki maine kuch charchaa kii he
 Neither i have called, nor emailed, nor written the letter, nor sent the message
 unka kisi memo main naam bhi nahin he
 The question is also right whether this deal could have been done without the top leaders of the Congress or without the top ministers of the UPA government
 rishwat di gai he to kisi ke ishaare par hi di gai hogi, lee gai hogi
 This thing will be revealed only when there is a thorough investigation
 wo bhi samay se
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel and Oscar Fernandes, MK Narayanan, who was the NSA during the UPA, is also named
 sonia gandhi se lekar ahamed patel ne tamaam aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 The BJP has said that at least Sonia Gandhi must respect the Italian court's decision
 congress ne bhi 10 sawaal puche hai
 There is another aspect in this case
 'hindu' akhbaar se isi james chrishchiyan mishael ne bolaa ki mujhe teen alag-alag sutron ne bataaya ki neuyark main bharat ke pradhanmantri or italy ke pradhanmantri ke bich chalate-chalate ek mulaakaat hui he
 In the Italian Marine case, the Prime Minister of India assured that he could help Italy if there was any evidence of the Gandhi family being implicated in the helicopter deal
 'hindu' akhbaar ne poocha ki kya saboot he ki meeting hui he
 Mitchell said that not only have they met, but the meeting lasted so long that the two had to change the time of their second meetings
 yah sab jab ho rahaa tha to rajdooton ne bataaya tha ki donon kii mulaakaat chal rahi he
 Mitchell asked the 'hindu' newspaper whether he had given in writing that the meeting did not take place
 is mulaakaat ke bare main 2 farvari 2016 kolkata se nikalne vaale akhbaar 'di telegraph' main is bare main khabar chhapi thi
 Mitchell wrote to the International Tribunal Court that the two Prime Ministers had met and the Prime Minister of India offered that the Marines would settle the dispute if some evidence was found about the Gandhi family
 antarrashtriya tribunel court main italy or bharat ke bich bharat main giraftaar do nausainikon kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 At the time the news was published that it is such a nonsense that even commenting is useless
 is baar bhi jab yah baat uthi to videsh mantralay ne apni yahi baat doharaai
 The Finance Minister also said that no such meeting has been held
 raajnneetik aarope to lag rahe hai
 The BJP has surrounded the Congress, but what will happen beyond politics? is maamle main jaanch kaa koi adhikrut states report to he nahin or na aisi koi report hoti he
 People want whoever is guilty is caught early
 kahin aisa na ho ki ishrat ke baad builder, bilderon kii thagi ke baad agasta, agasta ke baad kuch or maamla aa jaae or yah sab ek nura kushti banakar rah jaae
 Now there is a case of blacklisting agustawestland
 jaise hi e ke antni ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi blike list kar diya gaya tha, raksha mantri manohan parrikar ne chunauti de daali ki ki agar kiya he to dastauez dikhaaen
 Parrikar came to the media and told that the helicopter company was not banned at the time of AK Antony
 parrikar ke spashtikaran ke turant baad hi e ke antni blike list karne se neeche utar aae or prakriya shuru karne kii baat karne lage
 Look now prakriya shuru karne or bain karne main antar to he
 If AK Antony checked fast, it would not have happened
 tab congress bhi yah poochne lagi ki kyon agasta westland / finamakenika ko aapattiyon ke baavjood mek in india kaa hissaa banaaya gaya? kyon modi sarkaar ne agasta westland or tata ke joint venture ko helicopter banane kii manzuri di? kyon agasta westland ko 100 neval utility helicopter ke liye april 2015 main boli lagane di gai? The BJP has gained new energy from the decision of the Italian court that it can directly surround Sonia Gandhi in the corruption case
 sonia gandhi bhale saboot maang rahi hon lekin raajnneeti saboot kaa intazaar nahin karti
 It is true that the full copy of the judgment has not been read yet
 vahaan bharat kaa paksh nahin rakhaa gaya lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki agasta westland maamle main rishwat di gai he
 The matter of giving has been proved
 congress is sawaal ko chhod anya sawaalon ke zariye bijepi ko gherne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Questions are made but not as an answer to a bribe
 congress kaa kahana he ki chhattisgarh main bhi agasta se helicopter liya gaya he
 The CAG report stated that in 2007
 65
 70 lakh amareeki dollar kii is kharid ke liye dastauez is dhang se taiyaar kiye gaye taaki agasta westland ke alaava koi or company kharid prakriya main shaamil na ho paae
 Why is the Congress saying this now? lagaataar kyon nahin uthaai
 The comments 'diene' akhbaar ke deewakar anand ne likhaa he ki 10 farvari 2014 ko raksha mantralay ne agasta westland or finamaikanika ko blaclist kerani kii prakriya shuru kar di
 All the agreements with them were banned
 28 agast 2014 ko ek nai niti kaa aadesh aata he ki is tarah kii company ke saath kaisaa bartaav kiya jaae
 The order stated that there was no reason not to proceed with the agreement with finmanica Group
 usee aadesh main kaha gaya tha ki finamaikanika or sahyogiyon ko nae tender se alag rakhaa jayega
 Separate from the new tender and keep the old contract
 kya purna rup se pratibandh laga
 Is the answer to this question finally found? 11 farvari 2014 ke 'times aaf india' main yahi baat chhapi thi
 Many experts are saying that blacklisting Finmacanica is not easy
 3 april ko financial express main khabar chhapi he ki bharat sarkaar ne agasta westland ko 100 lite utility helicopter ke liye tender main bhaag lene kii anumati de di he
 The condition is that the company will have to partner with a local vendor
 agar ye baat sahi he to phir blike list kahaan hui
 Along with the leader officer, it is also coming to the fore that crores of rupees were spent to manage the media
 isliye sirf congress ke liye nahin media ke liye bhi jaanch zaruri he
 Who were managing journalists? balki company kii taraf se sarkaar ko hi manage kar rahe the
 Even today there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over Subramanian Swamy's talk
 unki baat ko karrwai se hataa to diya gaya lekin jo kaha suni hui usase lagata he ki is masale ko lekar bijepi congress ko chhodane vaali nahin he
 But what Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in response to this saying is interesting
 is baat kaa kya matlab he ki congress vaale jis skool main padhe hai uske nakvi ji master rahe hai
 This can be interpreted in many ways
 kya pataa wo yah kah rahe hai ki head master hone ke naate ham khub jaanate hai yaa jo aap karte hai wo ham aapse behatar kar sakate hai
 In February 2013, the UPA government also passed a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to form a JPC, but the JPC was not formed, as all the opposing parties objected
 je di you kaa kahana tha ki vipaksh kaa netaa is sanyukt sansadeey samiti kaa adhyaksh hoga to bijepi kaa kahana tha ki supreme court kii nigaraanee main jaanch honi chahie
 Is the investigation under the supervision of the Supreme Court right now? We do not know
 kul milakar je pi si bani nahin
 Then AK Antony as defense minister made a statement which would be interesting to know here
 vipaksh kaa aarope he ki ham kuch nahin kar rahe hai lekin italy kii nyaaypalika he, jo italy kii sarkaar se swatantra he, wo puraa cese dekh rahi he
 Our investigation is in the initial stage, their investigation is in the final stages
 italy main chal rahi jaanch kaa jo bhi parinaam hoga wo aa jayega
 In the meantime, the times of governments have changed, but our investigative agency feels that the initial phase has fascinated
 italy kii hoicourt kaa faisalaa bhi aa gaya
 As AK Antony, Italy's judiciary is independent of the government there, then there should not be any objection to the decision of that independent judiciary
 unheen kaa bayaan he
 BJP government has come
 bijepi ke mantri bhi usee italy kii nyaaypalika kii kasam kha rahe hai jisaki kabhi antni ji kha rahe the
 In October 2014, a lower court in Italy acquitted former Air Force chief SP Tyagi from all charges
 indian express ne likhaa he ki finamaikanika ke chairman oresi or pramukh branuso speganolini ko antarrashtriya bhrashtachar ke aaropon se mukt kar diya gaya, lekin farzi bill banane kaa aarope lagaate hue do saal kii sazaa suna di
 The High Court of Milan overturned this order, ruling that Orsi and Spageloni had bribed Indian officials to get the contract
 kya italy kii adaalat ne purv vayusena pramukh es ke tyaagi ke bare main koi tippanee kii he
 According to the 'economic Times' report of April 9, it has been proved in the Milan High Court that the Rs 3565 crore agustawestland contract, signed in 2010, has been bribed to Indian authorities
 iske alaava finamaikanika ke do bade adhikariyon ko antarrashtriya bhrashtachar or mani londring kaa doshi paaya he
 He has been sentenced to four years and both have also been fined
 is bich agasta westland ke maamle par 2012 ke saal se reporting karne vaale manu pabi 'indian express' se 'iconomik times' chale jate hai
 Manu Pabbi publishes the news in the 'economic Times' on 9 April
 hoicourt ke faisle main likhaa he ki is deal ke badale 10 million euro tyaagi bros ko diya gaya
 Part of it has also been given to former Air Force Chief Air Marshal SP Tyagi
 is baat ke paryaapt sanket milte hai
 The recording of conversations between two middlemen Heske and Gerosa indicates that there was also an attempt to hide Tyagi's role
 koun tyaagi ko bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha
 But did SP Tyagi try to benefit agustawestland by changing the ceiling of the helicopter
 main jitna samaj sakaa hum uske aadhaar par italy kii adaalat ne yahi kaha he ki aaropee paksh ne shuru main ek mahatvapurn aarope lagaaya tha ki tyaagi ne flite ceiling kii sharton ko kamazor kiya taaki agasta ko laabh mili
 The court believes that there is no evidence about it
 es pi tyaagi par yah aarope bharat kii media main bhi lag rahaa he
 But the Italian court has clearly said that they did wrong, there is no evidence of this, but there are indications that money must have been found
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki sarkaar kii agenciyon ke paas 225 pannon ke faisle kii copy kaa anuwaad nahin he
 Some part of the page written in Italian has been translated by some, while some people are taking help of Google translation
 raksha mantri ne anuwaad karaane kii baat kahi he
 Obviously, whatever is being said in this case, the copy of the judgment is being said without reading it completely
 ho saktaa he ki kuch bhi galat nahin ho magar ho saktaa he ki jiskaa naam liya ja rahaa he uski chhavi par hameshaa ko liye dhabba lag jaae
 In February 2013, while in the Indian Express, Manu Pabi wrote the news of Augusta, in which former Air Marshal SP Tyagi's name was mentioned
 us samay jab hamane unase baat kii thi to unhone kaha tha, '2007 main main ritair hua or yah kantrect sin hua he 2010 main, isliye mujhe kyon koi rishwat degaa
 'then i asked if the tender final was while your Air Force Chief
 tab tyaagi ji ne kaha ki 2006 main tender jari hua tha tab main hi vaayu sena pramukh tha, lekin isaki prakriya shuru hui san 2000 main
 Then Defense Minister George Fernandes used to go to Siachen and needed a helicopter that could go under 18000 feet in which VIP could go
 us vakt maine saaf-saaf poocha tha ki kya aap par kisi ne raajnneetik dabaav daalaa tha
 Tyagi had clearly stated that no pressure was exerted
 balki yah kaha ki sarkaar koi pressure nahin daalati he
 He kept saying in his reply that the change comes from the Ministry of Defense
 air force mukhyalay suzav de saktaa he
 Can not change
 2013 main tyaagi ji saaf-saaf kah rahe the ki sarkaar bilkul sidhaa or saaf kaam kar rahi thi
 What to say now is not known about the government but as before, they are still saying that whatever change happened was at the level of the Ministry of Defense
 italy kii court ne bhi apane faisle main kaha he ki iske pramaan nahin milte ki tyaagi ne flite ceiling kii sharton ko badalakar agasta westland ko laabh pahunchaaya
 Talking to our Defense Editor Nitin Gokhale, former Air Force chief SK Tyagi had said that he was under stress for a year and a half when the Italian lower court acquitted him
 meri jeet hui he
 But when the High Court of Milan overturned the judgment of the lower court this month, saying that Tyagi had been bribed, our colleague Rajiv Ranjan went to him
 es ke tyaagi ne kaha ki faisle kii copy nahin mili he, isliye kuch kahana thik nahin rahegaa
 The bribe amount has been given to the Air Chief Marshal, this accusation is as shameful as the bribe of Indian leaders
 vaayu sena ke manobal or chhavi ke liye zaruri he ki es pi tyaagi ke maamle main jaanch kaa nateeja jaldi aae
 The extradition directorate is reported to be questioning him
 aap soch rahe honge ki is maamle ko italy ke supreme court main bhi chunauti di jaaegi
 It may be given, but there the Supreme Court does not reconsider the facts and evidence of the case
 supreme court sirf kanoonee samiksha karegaa
 In 2012, on the second day of when the matter came up, the Ministry of Defense ordered the Italian Embassy to find out the facts
 12 farvari 2013 ko raksha mantralay yah maamla sibiai ko saunp detaa he
 In January 2014, India canceled the deal
 agasta ke teen helicopter zabt kar liye gaye
 India confiscated the money it had given to Augusta as a guarantee
 bharat me bhi sibiai or pratyrpan nideshaalay jaanch kar rahaa he
 The CBI has said that the investigation work has been completed on behalf of India
 sabhi gavaahon ke bayaan ricard ho chuke hai
 Letter of Rogatory has been sent to eight countries
 yah patr duusare deshon kii adaalaton ko sahyog ke liye likhaa jaataa he
 So far the answer has come from Italy, British Virgin Island, UK, Tunisia
 abhi ham vahaan se ai jaankaree ko pard rahe hai dekh rahe hai
 a red corner notice has been issued against the alleged middleman Michael
 sibiai bhi kah rahi he ki anaupchaarik rup se faisle kii copy mili he uskaa anuwaad kara rahe hai
 The Ministry of Defense is also getting the translation done
 raksha mantralay ne kaha he ki saat se aath din lag jaayenge anuwaad karaane main
 Think about how long it would take for a translation of 225 pages, then how long it would have taken to translate 90 thousand pages, if it had been done
 jiske bare main mujhe jaankaree nahin he
 The CBI has interrogated Tyagi Brothers in the meantime
 sabhi kaa 10-12 saal kaa bank ricard dekh liya he
 Air Marshal SP Tyagi has also been questioned before and the extradition directorate has said that it will be questioned again
 kaha jaataa he ki sibiai ko bhi pukhta saboot nahin mili hai ki inke paas paisa aayaa he yaa nahin
 SP Tyagi's brother Rajiv Tyagi says that from the tender of agustawestland till the deal was done, five Air Chiefs, four Defense Secretaries came and went
 do rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar aae or chale gaye
 Two defense ministers also came and went
 pranab mukherjee or e ke antni
 Why did SP Tyagi name only so many people? rajeev tyaagi puch rahe hai ki kya tamaam prakriya main air marshall es pi tyaagi hi the
 Not only this, there were two Prime Ministers during the deal
 atal bihari vaajapeyi or manmohan singh
 Rajiv Tyagi says that it was during the Vajpayee period that the flight height of the helicopter was reduced from 6000 meters to 4500 meters
 agasta se pehle ek or helicopter kaa chayan hua tha i si 225 yah keval 6000 meter tak hi ud saktaa tha
 At the time it was thought that such a helicopter would form a single company, so there is no question that the same company was deliberately called in the tender, hence the PMO suggested that helicopters flying at low altitude could be considered
 raksha mantralay kii site par agasta westland se sambandhit jo jaankariyaan di gai hai usee se bataa rahaa hum
 It is there since Antony's time and this information is there in Parrikar's time
 raksha mantralay ke anusaar 19 november 2003 ke din pradhan sachiv ne pradhanmantri ke saath baithak kii
 At the same time, it was decided to increase the flight height to 4500
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki in badlaavon se kai companiyon ko tender main bhaag lene kaa mauka miltaa
 It is only after this that Augusta enters the process of the Westland deal
 uske saath teen or companiyaan hoti hai
 Two companies exit at the start of the process and two are left - Augusta and Cicrosky
 is deal main ek integrity claaj tha jiske anusaar koi bhi rishwat kaa maamla saamne aayega to na keval sauda radd hoga, balki jo paisa diya ja chukaa hoga use bhi zabt kar liya jayega
 The Sekrosky Company refused to sign the class and dropped out of the process
 agasta westland ke saath qaraar hua
 The Government of India canceled the deal and confiscated the money as soon as the brokerage was revealed
 1567 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha, lekin isse zyada kii rakam company se bharat ne vasuul lee
 But these things do not reveal who took the bribe
 italy kii adaalat ne rishwat dene kii baat sabit kii he
 The Government of India has also accepted the bribe, only then the deal was canceled and the money was recovered
 sawaal he rishwat kisne lee
 This thing is neither known from there nor from here
 qatl hua he ye sabit ho gaya he magar qatl kiskaa hua he yahi pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If we see the record of the order, then the record of any government is not bad
 nateeja puuchhenge to ricard hi nahin milegaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been aggressive ever since this news appeared in the 'economic Times'
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki italy kii adaalat kaa faisla he
 This news has appeared in the media earlier, therefore it would not be right to accuse him of retaliation
 ye or baat he ki modi sarkaar se poocha ja rahaa he ki bharat main ho rahi jaanch kaa anjaam kab dekhne ko milegaa
 The Economic Times has written that Sinyora Gandhi's name appears four times in the judgment
 bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa ek patr jaanchakartaaon ko mila he jisase pataa chalata he ki is deal ke peeche cinyoraa gandhi mukhya shakti rahi hai
 Sinoyra in Italian means Smriti
 ek or bichauliye ne adaalat main congress netaa sonia gandhi kii tasviir kii pahchaan kii he
 Some of the middlemen have been pointing to some members of the Congress in confiscated notes
 naukarshahon or bhartiya vaayu sena ke adhikaron kii bhoomika ke bhi sanket milte hai
 Sonia Gandhi has said that there is no evidence
 ve kisi se nahin daratin
 What was the Modi government doing for two years
 buudhvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar kii suhasini haidar or josi joseph ne bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa intervyuu kiya he
 It has been arrested once
 isane hindu akhbaar ko bataaya he ki main sonia gandhi se kabhi nahin mila hum, na kisi hotel yaa kisi party main
 It is a matter of luck that i have not been found
 mila hota to kehete ki maine kuch charchaa kii he
 Neither i have called, nor emailed, nor written the letter, nor sent the message
 unka kisi memo main naam bhi nahin he
 The question is also right whether this deal could have been done without the top leaders of the Congress or without the top ministers of the UPA government
 rishwat di gai he to kisi ke ishaare par hi di gai hogi, lee gai hogi
 This thing will be revealed only when there is a thorough investigation
 wo bhi samay se
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel and Oscar Fernandes, MK Narayanan, who was the NSA during the UPA, is also named
 sonia gandhi se lekar ahamed patel ne tamaam aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 The BJP has said that at least Sonia Gandhi must respect the Italian court's decision
 congress ne bhi 10 sawaal puche hai
 There is another aspect in this case
 'hindu' akhbaar se isi james chrishchiyan mishael ne bolaa ki mujhe teen alag-alag sutron ne bataaya ki neuyark main bharat ke pradhanmantri or italy ke pradhanmantri ke bich chalate-chalate ek mulaakaat hui he
 In the Italian Marine case, the Prime Minister of India assured that he could help Italy if there was any evidence of the Gandhi family being implicated in the helicopter deal
 'hindu' akhbaar ne poocha ki kya saboot he ki meeting hui he
 Mitchell said that not only have they met, but the meeting lasted so long that the two had to change the time of their second meetings
 yah sab jab ho rahaa tha to rajdooton ne bataaya tha ki donon kii mulaakaat chal rahi he
 Mitchell asked the 'hindu' newspaper whether he had given in writing that the meeting did not take place
 is mulaakaat ke bare main 2 farvari 2016 kolkata se nikalne vaale akhbaar 'di telegraph' main is bare main khabar chhapi thi
 Mitchell wrote to the International Tribunal Court that the two Prime Ministers had met and the Prime Minister of India offered that the Marines would settle the dispute if some evidence was found about the Gandhi family
 antarrashtriya tribunel court main italy or bharat ke bich bharat main giraftaar do nausainikon kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 At the time the news was published that it is such a nonsense that even commenting is useless
 is baar bhi jab yah baat uthi to videsh mantralay ne apni yahi baat doharaai
 The Finance Minister also said that no such meeting has been held
 raajnneetik aarope to lag rahe hai
 The BJP has surrounded the Congress, but what will happen beyond politics? is maamle main jaanch kaa koi adhikrut states report to he nahin or na aisi koi report hoti he
 People want whoever is guilty is caught early
 kahin aisa na ho ki ishrat ke baad builder, bilderon kii thagi ke baad agasta, agasta ke baad kuch or maamla aa jaae or yah sab ek nura kushti banakar rah jaae
 Now there is a case of blacklisting agustawestland
 jaise hi e ke antni ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi blike list kar diya gaya tha, raksha mantri manohan parrikar ne chunauti de daali ki ki agar kiya he to dastauez dikhaaen
 Parrikar came to the media and told that the helicopter company was not banned at the time of AK Antony
 parrikar ke spashtikaran ke turant baad hi e ke antni blike list karne se neeche utar aae or prakriya shuru karne kii baat karne lage

 12 farvari 2013 ko raksha mantralay yah maamla sibiai ko saunp detaa he
 In January 2014, India canceled the deal
 agasta ke teen helicopter zabt kar liye gaye
 India confiscated the money it had given to Augusta as a guarantee
 bharat me bhi sibiai or pratyrpan nideshaalay jaanch kar rahaa he
 The CBI has said that the investigation work has been completed on behalf of India
 sabhi gavaahon ke bayaan ricard ho chuke hai
 Letter of Rogatory has been sent to eight countries
 yah patr duusare deshon kii adaalaton ko sahyog ke liye likhaa jaataa he
 So far the answer has come from Italy, British Virgin Island, UK, Tunisia
 abhi ham vahaan se ai jaankaree ko pard rahe hai dekh rahe hai
 a red corner notice has been issued against the alleged middleman Michael
 sibiai bhi kah rahi he ki anaupchaarik rup se faisle kii copy mili he uskaa anuwaad kara rahe hai
 The Ministry of Defense is also getting the translation done
 raksha mantralay ne kaha he ki saat se aath din lag jaayenge anuwaad karaane main
 Think about how long it would take for a translation of 225 pages, then how long it would have taken to translate 90 thousand pages, if it had been done
 jiske bare main mujhe jaankaree nahin he
 The CBI has interrogated Tyagi Brothers in the meantime
 sabhi kaa 10-12 saal kaa bank ricard dekh liya he
 Air Marshal SP Tyagi has also been questioned before and the extradition directorate has said that it will be questioned again
 kaha jaataa he ki sibiai ko bhi pukhta saboot nahin mili hai ki inke paas paisa aayaa he yaa nahin
 SP Tyagi's brother Rajiv Tyagi says that from the tender of agustawestland till the deal was done, five Air Chiefs, four Defense Secretaries came and went
 do rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar aae or chale gaye
 Two defense ministers also came and went
 pranab mukherjee or e ke antni
 Why did SP Tyagi name only so many people? rajeev tyaagi puch rahe hai ki kya tamaam prakriya main air marshall es pi tyaagi hi the
 Not only this, there were two Prime Ministers during the deal
 atal bihari vaajapeyi or manmohan singh
 Rajiv Tyagi says that it was during the Vajpayee period that the flight height of the helicopter was reduced from 6000 meters to 4500 meters
 agasta se pehle ek or helicopter kaa chayan hua tha i si 225 yah keval 6000 meter tak hi ud saktaa tha
 At the time it was thought that such a helicopter would form a single company, so there is no question that the same company was deliberately called in the tender, hence the PMO suggested that helicopters flying at low altitude could be considered
 raksha mantralay kii site par agasta westland se sambandhit jo jaankariyaan di gai hai usee se bataa rahaa hum
 It is there since Antony's time and this information is there in Parrikar's time
 raksha mantralay ke anusaar 19 november 2003 ke din pradhan sachiv ne pradhanmantri ke saath baithak kii
 At the same time, it was decided to increase the flight height to 4500
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki in badlaavon se kai companiyon ko tender main bhaag lene kaa mauka miltaa
 It is only after this that Augusta enters the process of the Westland deal
 uske saath teen or companiyaan hoti hai
 Two companies exit at the start of the process and two are left - Augusta and Cicrosky
 is deal main ek integrity claaj tha jiske anusaar koi bhi rishwat kaa maamla saamne aayega to na keval sauda radd hoga, balki jo paisa diya ja chukaa hoga use bhi zabt kar liya jayega
 The Sekrosky Company refused to sign the class and dropped out of the process
 agasta westland ke saath qaraar hua
 The Government of India canceled the deal and confiscated the money as soon as the brokerage was revealed
 1567 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha, lekin isse zyada kii rakam company se bharat ne vasuul lee
 But these things do not reveal who took the bribe
 italy kii adaalat ne rishwat dene kii baat sabit kii he
 The Government of India has also accepted the bribe, only then the deal was canceled and the money was recovered
 sawaal he rishwat kisne lee
 This thing is neither known from there nor from here
 qatl hua he ye sabit ho gaya he magar qatl kiskaa hua he yahi pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If we see the record of the order, then the record of any government is not bad
 nateeja puuchhenge to ricard hi nahin milegaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been aggressive ever since this news appeared in the 'economic Times'
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki italy kii adaalat kaa faisla he
 This news has appeared in the media earlier, therefore it would not be right to accuse him of retaliation
 ye or baat he ki modi sarkaar se poocha ja rahaa he ki bharat main ho rahi jaanch kaa anjaam kab dekhne ko milegaa
 The Economic Times has written that Sinyora Gandhi's name appears four times in the judgment
 bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa ek patr jaanchakartaaon ko mila he jisase pataa chalata he ki is deal ke peeche cinyoraa gandhi mukhya shakti rahi hai
 Sinoyra in Italian means Smriti
 ek or bichauliye ne adaalat main congress netaa sonia gandhi kii tasviir kii pahchaan kii he
 Some of the middlemen have been pointing to some members of the Congress in confiscated notes
 naukarshahon or bhartiya vaayu sena ke adhikaron kii bhoomika ke bhi sanket milte hai
 Sonia Gandhi has said that there is no evidence
 ve kisi se nahin daratin
 What was the Modi government doing for two years
 buudhvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar kii suhasini haidar or josi joseph ne bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa intervyuu kiya he
 It has been arrested once
 isane hindu akhbaar ko bataaya he ki main sonia gandhi se kabhi nahin mila hum, na kisi hotel yaa kisi party main
 It is a matter of luck that i have not been found
 mila hota to kehete ki maine kuch charchaa kii he
 Neither i have called, nor emailed, nor written the letter, nor sent the message
 unka kisi memo main naam bhi nahin he
 The question is also right whether this deal could have been done without the top leaders of the Congress or without the top ministers of the UPA government
 rishwat di gai he to kisi ke ishaare par hi di gai hogi, lee gai hogi
 This thing will be revealed only when there is a thorough investigation
 wo bhi samay se
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel and Oscar Fernandes, MK Narayanan, who was the NSA during the UPA, is also named
 sonia gandhi se lekar ahamed patel ne tamaam aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 The BJP has said that at least Sonia Gandhi must respect the Italian court's decision
 congress ne bhi 10 sawaal puche hai
 There is another aspect in this case
 'hindu' akhbaar se isi james chrishchiyan mishael ne bolaa ki mujhe teen alag-alag sutron ne bataaya ki neuyark main bharat ke pradhanmantri or italy ke pradhanmantri ke bich chalate-chalate ek mulaakaat hui he
 In the Italian Marine case, the Prime Minister of India assured that he could help Italy if there was any evidence of the Gandhi family being implicated in the helicopter deal
 'hindu' akhbaar ne poocha ki kya saboot he ki meeting hui he
 Mitchell said that not only have they met, but the meeting lasted so long that the two had to change the time of their second meetings
 yah sab jab ho rahaa tha to rajdooton ne bataaya tha ki donon kii mulaakaat chal rahi he
 Mitchell asked the 'hindu' newspaper whether he had given in writing that the meeting did not take place
 is mulaakaat ke bare main 2 farvari 2016 kolkata se nikalne vaale akhbaar 'di telegraph' main is bare main khabar chhapi thi
 Mitchell wrote to the International Tribunal Court that the two Prime Ministers had met and the Prime Minister of India offered that the Marines would settle the dispute if some evidence was found about the Gandhi family
 antarrashtriya tribunel court main italy or bharat ke bich bharat main giraftaar do nausainikon kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 At the time the news was published that it is such a nonsense that even commenting is useless
 is baar bhi jab yah baat uthi to videsh mantralay ne apni yahi baat doharaai
 The Finance Minister also said that no such meeting has been held
 raajnneetik aarope to lag rahe hai
 The BJP has surrounded the Congress, but what will happen beyond politics? is maamle main jaanch kaa koi adhikrut states report to he nahin or na aisi koi report hoti he
 People want whoever is guilty is caught early
 kahin aisa na ho ki ishrat ke baad builder, bilderon kii thagi ke baad agasta, agasta ke baad kuch or maamla aa jaae or yah sab ek nura kushti banakar rah jaae
 Now there is a case of blacklisting agustawestland
 jaise hi e ke antni ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi blike list kar diya gaya tha, raksha mantri manohan parrikar ne chunauti de daali ki ki agar kiya he to dastauez dikhaaen
 Parrikar came to the media and told that the helicopter company was not banned at the time of AK Antony
 parrikar ke spashtikaran ke turant baad hi e ke antni blike list karne se neeche utar aae or prakriya shuru karne kii baat karne lage
 Look now prakriya shuru karne or bain karne main antar to he
 If AK Antony checked fast, it would not have happened
 tab congress bhi yah poochne lagi ki kyon agasta westland / finamakenika ko aapattiyon ke baavjood mek in india kaa hissaa banaaya gaya? kyon modi sarkaar ne agasta westland or tata ke joint venture ko helicopter banane kii manzuri di? kyon agasta westland ko 100 neval utility helicopter ke liye april 2015 main boli lagane di gai? The BJP has gained new energy from the decision of the Italian court that it can directly surround Sonia Gandhi in the corruption case
 sonia gandhi bhale saboot maang rahi hon lekin raajnneeti saboot kaa intazaar nahin karti
 It is true that the full copy of the judgment has not been read yet
 vahaan bharat kaa paksh nahin rakhaa gaya lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki agasta westland maamle main rishwat di gai he
 The matter of giving has been proved
 congress is sawaal ko chhod anya sawaalon ke zariye bijepi ko gherne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Questions are made but not as an answer to a bribe
 congress kaa kahana he ki chhattisgarh main bhi agasta se helicopter liya gaya he
 The CAG report stated that in 2007
 65
 70 lakh amareeki dollar kii is kharid ke liye dastauez is dhang se taiyaar kiye gaye taaki agasta westland ke alaava koi or company kharid prakriya main shaamil na ho paae
 Why is the Congress saying this now? lagaataar kyon nahin uthaai
 The comments 'diene' akhbaar ke deewakar anand ne likhaa he ki 10 farvari 2014 ko raksha mantralay ne agasta westland or finamaikanika ko blaclist kerani kii prakriya shuru kar di
 All the agreements with them were banned
 28 agast 2014 ko ek nai niti kaa aadesh aata he ki is tarah kii company ke saath kaisaa bartaav kiya jaae
 The order stated that there was no reason not to proceed with the agreement with finmanica Group
 usee aadesh main kaha gaya tha ki finamaikanika or sahyogiyon ko nae tender se alag rakhaa jayega
 Separate from the new tender and keep the old contract
 kya purna rup se pratibandh laga
 Is the answer to this question finally found? 11 farvari 2014 ke 'times aaf india' main yahi baat chhapi thi
 Many experts are saying that blacklisting Finmacanica is not easy
 3 april ko financial express main khabar chhapi he ki bharat sarkaar ne agasta westland ko 100 lite utility helicopter ke liye tender main bhaag lene kii anumati de di he
 The condition is that the company will have to partner with a local vendor
 agar ye baat sahi he to phir blike list kahaan hui
 Along with the leader officer, it is also coming to the fore that crores of rupees were spent to manage the media
 isliye sirf congress ke liye nahin media ke liye bhi jaanch zaruri he
 Who were managing journalists? balki company kii taraf se sarkaar ko hi manage kar rahe the
 Even today there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over Subramanian Swamy's talk
 unki baat ko karrwai se hataa to diya gaya lekin jo kaha suni hui usase lagata he ki is masale ko lekar bijepi congress ko chhodane vaali nahin he
 But what Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in response to this saying is interesting
 is baat kaa kya matlab he ki congress vaale jis skool main padhe hai uske nakvi ji master rahe hai
 This can be interpreted in many ways
 kya pataa wo yah kah rahe hai ki head master hone ke naate ham khub jaanate hai yaa jo aap karte hai wo ham aapse behatar kar sakate hai
 The High Court of Milan overturned this order, ruling that Orsi and Spageloni had bribed Indian officials to get the contract
 kya italy kii adaalat ne purv vayusena pramukh es ke tyaagi ke bare main koi tippanee kii he
 According to the 'economic Times' report of April 9, it has been proved in the Milan High Court that the Rs 3565 crore agustawestland contract, signed in 2010, has been bribed to Indian authorities
 iske alaava finamaikanika ke do bade adhikariyon ko antarrashtriya bhrashtachar or mani londring kaa doshi paaya he
 He has been sentenced to four years and both have also been fined
 is bich agasta westland ke maamle par 2012 ke saal se reporting karne vaale manu pabi 'indian express' se 'iconomik times' chale jate hai
 Manu Pabbi publishes the news in the 'economic Times' on 9 April
 hoicourt ke faisle main likhaa he ki is deal ke badale 10 million euro tyaagi bros ko diya gaya
 Part of it has also been given to former Air Force Chief Air Marshal SP Tyagi
 is baat ke paryaapt sanket milte hai
 The recording of conversations between two middlemen Heske and Gerosa indicates that there was also an attempt to hide Tyagi's role
 koun tyaagi ko bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha
 But did SP Tyagi try to benefit agustawestland by changing the ceiling of the helicopter
 main jitna samaj sakaa hum uske aadhaar par italy kii adaalat ne yahi kaha he ki aaropee paksh ne shuru main ek mahatvapurn aarope lagaaya tha ki tyaagi ne flite ceiling kii sharton ko kamazor kiya taaki agasta ko laabh mili
 The court believes that there is no evidence about it
 es pi tyaagi par yah aarope bharat kii media main bhi lag rahaa he
 But the Italian court has clearly said that they did wrong, there is no evidence of this, but there are indications that money must have been found
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki sarkaar kii agenciyon ke paas 225 pannon ke faisle kii copy kaa anuwaad nahin he
 Some part of the page written in Italian has been translated by some, while some people are taking help of Google translation
 raksha mantri ne anuwaad karaane kii baat kahi he
 Obviously, whatever is being said in this case, the copy of the judgment is being said without reading it completely
 ho saktaa he ki kuch bhi galat nahin ho magar ho saktaa he ki jiskaa naam liya ja rahaa he uski chhavi par hameshaa ko liye dhabba lag jaae
 In February 2013, while in the Indian Express, Manu Pabi wrote the news of Augusta, in which former Air Marshal SP Tyagi's name was mentioned
 us samay jab hamane unase baat kii thi to unhone kaha tha, '2007 main main ritair hua or yah kantrect sin hua he 2010 main, isliye mujhe kyon koi rishwat degaa
 'then i asked if the tender final was while your Air Force Chief
 tab tyaagi ji ne kaha ki 2006 main tender jari hua tha tab main hi vaayu sena pramukh tha, lekin isaki prakriya shuru hui san 2000 main
 Then Defense Minister George Fernandes used to go to Siachen and needed a helicopter that could go under 18000 feet in which VIP could go
 us vakt maine saaf-saaf poocha tha ki kya aap par kisi ne raajnneetik dabaav daalaa tha
 Tyagi had clearly stated that no pressure was exerted
 balki yah kaha ki sarkaar koi pressure nahin daalati he
 He kept saying in his reply that the change comes from the Ministry of Defense
 air force mukhyalay suzav de saktaa he
 Can not change
 2013 main tyaagi ji saaf-saaf kah rahe the ki sarkaar bilkul sidhaa or saaf kaam kar rahi thi
 What to say now is not known about the government but as before, they are still saying that whatever change happened was at the level of the Ministry of Defense
 italy kii court ne bhi apane faisle main kaha he ki iske pramaan nahin milte ki tyaagi ne flite ceiling kii sharton ko badalakar agasta westland ko laabh pahunchaaya
 Talking to our Defense Editor Nitin Gokhale, former Air Force chief SK Tyagi had said that he was under stress for a year and a half when the Italian lower court acquitted him
 meri jeet hui he
 But when the High Court of Milan overturned the judgment of the lower court this month, saying that Tyagi had been bribed, our colleague Rajiv Ranjan went to him
 es ke tyaagi ne kaha ki faisle kii copy nahin mili he, isliye kuch kahana thik nahin rahegaa
 The bribe amount has been given to the Air Chief Marshal, this accusation is as shameful as the bribe of Indian leaders
 vaayu sena ke manobal or chhavi ke liye zaruri he ki es pi tyaagi ke maamle main jaanch kaa nateeja jaldi aae
 The extradition directorate is reported to be questioning him
 aap soch rahe honge ki is maamle ko italy ke supreme court main bhi chunauti di jaaegi
 It may be given, but there the Supreme Court does not reconsider the facts and evidence of the case
 supreme court sirf kanoonee samiksha karegaa
 In 2012, on the second day of when the matter came up, the Ministry of Defense ordered the Italian Embassy to find out the facts

 Who were managing journalists? balki company kii taraf se sarkaar ko hi manage kar rahe the
 Even today there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over Subramanian Swamy's talk
 unki baat ko karrwai se hataa to diya gaya lekin jo kaha suni hui usase lagata he ki is masale ko lekar bijepi congress ko chhodane vaali nahin he
 But what Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in response to this saying is interesting
 is baat kaa kya matlab he ki congress vaale jis skool main padhe hai uske nakvi ji master rahe hai
 This can be interpreted in many ways
 kya pataa wo yah kah rahe hai ki head master hone ke naate ham khub jaanate hai yaa jo aap karte hai wo ham aapse behatar kar sakate hai
 Meanwhile, Manu Pabbi, reporting on the Augusta Westland case from the year 2012, goes from 'indian Express' to 'economic Times'
 manu pabi 9 april ko 'iconomik times' main khabar chhapate hai
 The High Court judgment states that 10 million euros was given to Tyagi Brothers in exchange for this deal
 iskaa kuch hissaa purv vayusena pramukh air marshall espi tyaagi ko bhi mila he
 There are enough indications of this
 do bichauliye heske or gerosa kii baatcheet kii ricarding se sanket miltaa he ki tyaagi kii bhoomika ko chupaane kii bhi koshish hui
 Who was trying to save Tyagi
 lekin kya es pi tyaagi ne helicopter kii ceiling main badlaav kar agasta westland ko laabh pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya
 On the basis of what i have understood, the Italian court has said that the accused party had initially made a significant allegation that Tyagi had weakened the terms of flight sealing so that Augusta would benefit
 adaalat maanati he ki iske bare main koi saboot nahin he
 SP Tyagi is also facing this charge in the Indian media
 magar italy kii adaalat ne saaf kaha he ki unhone galat kiya, iske saboot nahin milte, magar iske sanket milte hai ki paisa mila hoga
 One thing to be noted is that the government agencies do not have a copy of the 225-page judgment copy
 italian main likhe panne ke kuch hisse kaa anuwaad kisi ne kiya he to kuch log google transleshan kii madad le rahe hai
 The Defense Minister has said to get the translation done
 zaahir he is maamle main jo bhi kaha ja rahaa he faisle kii copy ko bina puraa padhe hi kaha ja rahaa he
 There may be nothing wrong, but it may be that the image of the person being named is smeared forever
 farvari 2013 main jab indian express main rahete hue manu pabi ne agasta kii khabar likhi jisamen purv air marshall es pi tyaagi kaa naam aayaa tha
 At the time when we talked to him, he said, "I retired in 2007 and this contract has been signed in 2010, so why would anyone give me a bribe?" ' tab maine poocha ki tender final to aapke vaayu sena pramukh rahete hue tha
 Then Tyagi said that i was the Chief of the Air Force when the tender was issued in 2006, but the process started in 2000
 tab raksha mantri jorge furnandis siachin jaaya karte the or aise ek helicopter kii zarurat thi jo 18000 feet ke neeche chalaa jaae jisamen ve ai pi ja saken
 At that time, i had asked clearly whether anyone had put political pressure on you
 tyaagi ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki koi dabaav nahin daalaa gaya tha
 Rather it said that the government does not put any pressure
 wo apane jawaab main kehete rahe ki badlaav raksha mantralay se hota he
 Air Force Headquarters may suggest
 badal nahin saktaa
 In 2013, Tyagi was clearly saying that the government was doing a fairly straightforward and clean job
 ab kya kahana he sarkaar ke bare main maaloom nahin magar pehle kii tarah ab bhi ve yahi kah rahe hai ki jo bhi badlaav hua wo raksha mantralay ke str par hua
 The Italian court has also said in its judgment that there is no evidence that Tyagi benefited agustawestland by changing the terms of flight sealing
 jab italy kii nichali adaalat ne unhen aarope mukt kiya tha tab tab hamaare raksha sampadak nitin gokhale se baat karte hue vayusena ke purv pramukh es ke tyaagi ne kaha tha ki dedh saal se tanaav main tha
 i have won lekin jab isi maheene milan ke hoicourt ne nichali adaalat kaa faisla palat kar yah kah diya ki tyaagi ko rishwat di gai he to hamaare sahyogi rajeev ranjan unke paas gaye
 SK Tyagi said that the copy of the verdict has not been received, so it would not be right to say anything
 air chif marshall ko rishwat kii rakam di gai he, yah aarope utani hi sharmnaak he jitani bhartiya netaaon kii rishwat diye jane kii baat
 It is important for the morale and image of the Air Force that the outcome of the investigation in SP Tyagi's case should come quickly
 khabar he ki pratyrpan nideshaalay unase poochtacha karne vaala he
 You might be thinking that this case will also be challenged in the Supreme Court of Italy
 ho saktaa he di jaae, magar vahaan kaa supreme court cese ke tathyon or sabooton par dobaaraa se vichaar nahin karata he
 The Supreme Court will only conduct a legal review
 2012 main jab yah maamla uthaa tha uske duusare din hi raksha mantralay ne italy ke duutavas se tathyon kaa pataa lagane kaa aadesh diya tha
 On 12 February 2013, the Ministry of Defense hands over the case to the CBI
 janvari 2014 main bharat ne deal cancil kar di
 Three helicopters of Augusta were confiscated
 bharat ne guarantee ke rup main agasta ko jo paise diye the use jabt kar liya
 The CBI and the Extradition Directorate are also investigating in India
 sibiai ne kaha he ki bharat kii taraf se jaanch kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa he
 The statements of all the witnesses have been recorded
 aath deshon main letters aaf rogetary bheja gaya he
 This letter is written to the courts of other countries for cooperation
 abhi tak italy, british virgin island, euke, tunisia se jawaab aa gaya he
 Right now we are reading the information coming from there
 kathith bichauliya maaikel ke khilaaf red carnor notice jari kar diya he
 The CBI is also saying that informal copies of the verdict have been got translated
 raksha mantralay bhi anuwaad kara rahaa he
 The Ministry of Defense has said that it will take seven to eight days to translate
 sochiye 225 pej ke anuwaad main haftaa lagegaa to 90 hazaar pannon ke anuwaad main kitna vakt laga hoga, agar anuwaad ho gaya hoga to
 About which i am not aware
 sibiai ne bich main tyaagi bros se poochtacha kii he
 Everyone has seen a bank record of 10-12 years
 air marshall es pi tyaagi se pehle bhi poochtacha ho chuki he or pratyrpan nideshaalay ne kaha he ki phir poochtacha hogi
 It is said that even the CBI has not found strong evidence that money has come to them or not
 espi tyaagi ke bhai rajeev tyaagi kahana he ki agasta westland ke tender se lekar deal hone tak paanch air chif hue, chaar raksha sachiv aae or chale gaye
 Two National Security Advisers came and went
 do raksha mantri bhi aae or chale gaye
 Pranab Mukherjee and AK Antony
 itane logon ke kya sirf es pi tyaagi kaa hi naam kyon aayaa
 Rajiv Tyagi is asking if Air Marshal SP Tyagi was the only one in the process
 yahi nahin deal ke dauraan do pradhanmantri ho gaye
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh
 rajeev tyaagi kaa kahana he ki vaajapeyi kaal main hi helicopter ke udaan kii oonchai 6000 meter se ghataakar 4500 kiya gaya
 Before Augusta, another helicopter was selected EC 225 It could fly up to 6000 meters only
 us samay sochaa gaya ki aisa helicopter ek hi company banaati he, lihaaza sawaal na khadaa ho jaae ki ek hi company ko jaanboojh kar tender main bulaayaa gaya, isliye piemo ne suzav diya ki kam oonchai par udne vaale helicopter par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 i am telling you the information related to agustawestland on the site of the Ministry of Defense
 antni ke samay se hi vahaan he or parrikar ke samay main yahi jaankaree he
 According to the Ministry of Defense, on 19 November 2003, the Principal Secretary held a meeting with the Prime Minister
 vahiin faisla hua ki udaan kii oonchai 4500 kar di jaae
 This was done because these changes would allow many companies to participate in the tender
 iske baad hi agasta westland deal kii prakriya main pravesh karata he
 He is accompanied by three more companies
 do companiyaan prakriya kii shuruuaat main hi baahar ho jaati hai or do batch jaati hai- agasta or sikroski
 There was an Integrity Clause in this deal, according to which any bribery case will come up, not only will the deal be canceled, but the money that has been paid will also be confiscated
 sikroski company ne is claaj par sin karne se manaa kar diya or wo is prakriya se baahar ho gai
 Agreed with agustawestland
 dallali kii baat saamne aate hi bharat sarkaar ne sauda radd kar diya or paisa bhi zabt kar liya
 Rs 1567 crore was paid, but more than that was recovered by India from the company
 magar in baton se yah nahin pataa chalata ki kisne rishwat lee
 The Italian court has proved the bribe
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi rishwat diye jane kii baat maani he tabhi to sauda radd kiya gaya or paisa vasula gaya
 The question is who took the bribe
 yah baat na vahaan se pataa chalati he na yahaan se
 It has been proved that the murder has happened, but whose murder is not known
 aadesh kaa ricard dekhenge to kisi bhi sarkaar kaa ricard karaab nahin he
 If you ask the result, you will not get a record
 jab se yah khabar 'iconomik times' main chhapi he tab se bhartiya janata party aakraamak he
 The BJP says that the Italian court has decided
 media main yah khabar pehle chhapi he isliye us par badale kii karrwai kaa aarope lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 It is another matter that the Modi government is being asked when the outcome of the investigation going on in India will be seen
 'iconomik times' ne likhaa he ki faisle main cinyoraa gandhi kaa naam chaar baar aayaa he
 Investigators have received a letter from middleman Christian Mitchell, indicating that Sinora Gandhi was the main force behind the deal
 italian main cinyoraa kaa matlab shrimati hota he
 Another middleman has identified the picture of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi in the court
 kai saare bichauliyon se zabt note main congress ke kuch sadasyon kii taraf ishaara ho rahaa he
 There are also indications of the role of bureaucrats and the rights of the Indian Air Force
 sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki koi saboot nahin he
 She is not afraid of anyone
 modi sarkaar do saal se kya kar rahi thi
 On Wednesday, Suhasini Haider and Josie Joseph of 'hindu' newspaper interviewed middleman Christian Mitchell
 yah ek baar giraftaar ho chukaa he
 It has told the Hindu newspaper that i have never met Sonia Gandhi, nor in any hotel or any party
 bhagya kii baat he ki nahin mila hum
 If i had met, i would have said that i have discussed something
 na maine phone kiya he, na email kiya he, na letters likhaa he, na massej kiya he
 He is not even named in any memo
 yah sawaal vaazib bhi he ki kya congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bina yaa upie sarkaar ke sheersh mantriyon ke bina yah deal ho sakati thi
 If a bribe has been given, it would have been given at the behest of someone, it would have been taken
 yah baat tabhi saamne aegi jab isaki pukhta jaanch hogi
 From that time too
 manmohan singh, ahamed patel or auskar furnandis ke alaava upie ke vakt enese rahe emke narayanan kaa bhi naam he
 From Sonia Gandhi to Ahmed Patel, all the allegations have been denied
 bijepi ne kaha he ki kam se kam sonia gandhi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisale kaa sammaan to karnaa hi chahie
 Congress has also asked 10 questions
 is maamle main ek or pahalu he
 The same James Christian Mitchell told the 'hindu' newspaper that three different sources told me that there was a meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Italy in New York
 italian marine cese maamle main bharat ke pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan diya ki ve italy kii madad kar sakate hai agar helicopter saude main gandhi parivaar ko fansaane kaa koi saboot mil jaae to
 The Hindu newspaper asked if there was any evidence that the meeting had taken place
 mishael ne kaha ki na sirf mulaakaat hui he, balki itani der chal mulaakaat chali ki donon ko apni duusari baithkon ke samay main badlaav karnaa padaa tha
 When all this was happening, the ambassadors had told that the two were meeting
 mishael ne 'hindu' akhbaar se poocha ki kya unhone likhit rup main diya he ki mulaakaat nahin
 The news about this meeting was published in the newspaper 'the Telegraph' originating from Kolkata on 2 February 2016
 mishael ne antarrashtriya tribunel court ko likhaa tha ki donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich mulaakaat hui he or bharat ke pradhanmantri ne peshkash kii he ki agar gandhi parivaar ke bare main kuch saboot mil jaae to marine vivaad ko sulajhaa denge
 The case of two marines arrested in India is going on between Italy and India in the International Tribunal Court
 jis vakt khabar chhapi thi ki ye itani bakawaas baat he ki coment karnaa bhi bekaar he
 This time also when this matter arose, the Ministry of External Affairs repeated the same thing
 sadan main vitt mantri ne bhi kaha ki aisi koi mulaakaat nahin hui he
 Political allegations are being made
 bijepi ne congress ko gher to liya he lekin kya baat raajnneeti se bhi aage badhegi
 In this case, there is no official status report of inquiry and there is no such report
 log chaahate hai ki jo bhi doshi he wo jaldi pakadaa jaae
 It should not happen that after Ishrat, the builder, after the cheating of the builders, Augusta, after Augusta, some other issue will come and it all becomes a nura wrestling
 ab ek maamla he agasta westland ko blike list karne kaa
 As soon as AK Antony said that he was blacklisted during his tenure, Defense Minister Manohan Parrikar challenged that the documents be shown if done
 parrikar media ke saamne aae or bataa diya ki e ke antni ke samay helicopter company ko bain nahin kiya gaya tha
 Soon after Parrikar's clarification, AK Antony came down from the black list and started talking about starting the process
 ab dekhiye
 There is a difference between starting and banning the process
 e ke antni agar tezi se se jaanch karte to ye naubat nahin aati
 The Congress then started asking why agustawestland / Finnamica was made a part of Make in India despite objections? Why did the Modi government allow agustawestland and Tata's joint venture to make helicopters? Why agustawestland was allowed to bid for 100 Naval Utility Helicopters in April 2015? bijepi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisle se nai urja mili he ki iske zariye sonia gandhi ko bhrashtachar ke maamle main sidhe sidhe gheraa ja saktaa he
 Sonia Gandhi may be asking for proof but politics does not wait for proof
 sahi he ki faisle kii puri copy abhi tak nahin padhi gai he
 India's favor was not kept there but it is also a fact that bribe has been given in the agustawestland case
 dene kii baat sabit ho chuki he
 Except this question, the Congress is trying to surround the BJP through other questions
 sawaal to banate hai magar rishwat vaale sawaal ke jawaab ke rup main nahin
 The Congress says that chopper has been taken from Agusta in Chhattisgarh too
 sieji kii report ne kaha he ki 2007 main 65
 Documents for this purchase of US $ 7 million were prepared in such a way that no company other than agustawestland was involved in the procurement process
 yah baat congress abhi kyon kah rahi he
 Why did not you constantly lift
 tippaniyan Diwakar Anand of the 'DNA' newspaper wrote that on 10 February 2014, the Ministry of Defense started the process of blacklisting agustawestland and Finmanica
 inke saath hue saare qaraar par roak laga di thi
 On August 28, 2014, a new policy order comes in how to treat such a company
 is aadesh main likhaa tha ki koi kaaran nahin he ki finamaikanika group ke saath hue qaraar ke saath aage na badha jaae
 The same order stated that Finmacanica and allies would be excluded from the new tender
 nae tender se alag bhi rakhana he or puraane qaraar ko jari bhi rakhana he
 Is there a complete ban
 kya is sawaal kaa jawaab antim rup se mil gaya he
 The same thing appeared in 'times of India' on 11 February 2014
 kai jaankaar kah rahe hai ki finamaikanika ko blike list karnaa aasaan nahin he
 On 3 April, Financial Express reported that the Indian government had allowed agustawestland to participate in the tender for 100 light utility helicopters
 shart he ki company ko kisi sthaneey vendor se saajheedaari kerani hogi
 If this is true, then where is the black list? netaa adhikari ke saath-saath yah baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki karodon rupee media manage karne ke liye bhi kharch kiye gaye
 Therefore, investigation is important not only for the Congress but also for the media
 koun koun patrkaar manage ho rahe the
 Rather, they were managing the government on behalf of the company
 aaj bhi rajya sabha main subramanyam swami kii baat ko lekar hangaamaa ho gaya
 His point was dropped from the action, but from what he heard, it seems that BJP is not going to leave the Congress on this issue
 lekin is kahasuni ke jawaab main jo kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kah gaye wo dilachasp he
 What does this mean that Naqvi has been the master of the school where the Congressmen are studying
 isaki vyakhya kai roopon main kii ja sakati he
 Do you know what they are saying that as Head Master we know a lot or what you do, we can do better than you
 es pi tyaagi par yah aarope bharat kii media main bhi lag rahaa he
 But the Italian court has clearly said that they did wrong, there is no evidence of this, but there are indications that money must have been found
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki sarkaar kii agenciyon ke paas 225 pannon ke faisle kii copy kaa anuwaad nahin he
 Some part of the page written in Italian has been translated by some, while some people are taking help of Google translation
 raksha mantri ne anuwaad karaane kii baat kahi he
 Obviously, whatever is being said in this case, the copy of the judgment is being said without reading it completely
 ho saktaa he ki kuch bhi galat nahin ho magar ho saktaa he ki jiskaa naam liya ja rahaa he uski chhavi par hameshaa ko liye dhabba lag jaae
 In February 2013, while in the Indian Express, Manu Pabi wrote the news of Augusta, in which former Air Marshal SP Tyagi's name was mentioned
 us samay jab hamane unase baat kii thi to unhone kaha tha, '2007 main main ritair hua or yah kantrect sin hua he 2010 main, isliye mujhe kyon koi rishwat degaa
 'then i asked if the tender final was while your Air Force Chief
 tab tyaagi ji ne kaha ki 2006 main tender jari hua tha tab main hi vaayu sena pramukh tha, lekin isaki prakriya shuru hui san 2000 main
 Then Defense Minister George Fernandes used to go to Siachen and needed a helicopter that could go under 18000 feet in which VIP could go
 us vakt maine saaf-saaf poocha tha ki kya aap par kisi ne raajnneetik dabaav daalaa tha
 Tyagi had clearly stated that no pressure was exerted
 balki yah kaha ki sarkaar koi pressure nahin daalati he
 He kept saying in his reply that the change comes from the Ministry of Defense
 air force mukhyalay suzav de saktaa he
 Can not change
 2013 main tyaagi ji saaf-saaf kah rahe the ki sarkaar bilkul sidhaa or saaf kaam kar rahi thi
 What to say now is not known about the government but as before, they are still saying that whatever change happened was at the level of the Ministry of Defense
 italy kii court ne bhi apane faisle main kaha he ki iske pramaan nahin milte ki tyaagi ne flite ceiling kii sharton ko badalakar agasta westland ko laabh pahunchaaya
 Talking to our Defense Editor Nitin Gokhale, former Air Force chief SK Tyagi had said that he was under stress for a year and a half when the Italian lower court acquitted him
 meri jeet hui he
 But when the High Court of Milan overturned the judgment of the lower court this month, saying that Tyagi had been bribed, our colleague Rajiv Ranjan went to him
 es ke tyaagi ne kaha ki faisle kii copy nahin mili he, isliye kuch kahana thik nahin rahegaa
 The bribe amount has been given to the Air Chief Marshal, this accusation is as shameful as the bribe of Indian leaders
 vaayu sena ke manobal or chhavi ke liye zaruri he ki es pi tyaagi ke maamle main jaanch kaa nateeja jaldi aae
 The extradition directorate is reported to be questioning him
 aap soch rahe honge ki is maamle ko italy ke supreme court main bhi chunauti di jaaegi
 It may be given, but there the Supreme Court does not reconsider the facts and evidence of the case
 supreme court sirf kanoonee samiksha karegaa
 In 2012, on the second day of when the matter came up, the Ministry of Defense ordered the Italian Embassy to find out the facts
 12 farvari 2013 ko raksha mantralay yah maamla sibiai ko saunp detaa he
 In January 2014, India canceled the deal
 agasta ke teen helicopter zabt kar liye gaye
 India confiscated the money it had given to Augusta as a guarantee
 bharat me bhi sibiai or pratyrpan nideshaalay jaanch kar rahaa he
 The CBI has said that the investigation work has been completed on behalf of India
 sabhi gavaahon ke bayaan ricard ho chuke hai
 Letter of Rogatory has been sent to eight countries
 yah patr duusare deshon kii adaalaton ko sahyog ke liye likhaa jaataa he
 So far the answer has come from Italy, British Virgin Island, UK, Tunisia
 abhi ham vahaan se ai jaankaree ko pard rahe hai dekh rahe hai
 a red corner notice has been issued against the alleged middleman Michael
 sibiai bhi kah rahi he ki anaupchaarik rup se faisle kii copy mili he uskaa anuwaad kara rahe hai
 The Ministry of Defense is also getting the translation done
 raksha mantralay ne kaha he ki saat se aath din lag jaayenge anuwaad karaane main
 Think about how long it would take for a translation of 225 pages, then how long it would have taken to translate 90 thousand pages, if it had been done
 jiske bare main mujhe jaankaree nahin he
 The CBI has interrogated Tyagi Brothers in the meantime
 sabhi kaa 10-12 saal kaa bank ricard dekh liya he
 Air Marshal SP Tyagi has also been questioned before and the extradition directorate has said that it will be questioned again
 kaha jaataa he ki sibiai ko bhi pukhta saboot nahin mili hai ki inke paas paisa aayaa he yaa nahin
 SP Tyagi's brother Rajiv Tyagi says that from the tender of agustawestland till the deal was done, five Air Chiefs, four Defense Secretaries came and went
 do rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar aae or chale gaye
 Two defense ministers also came and went
 pranab mukherjee or e ke antni
 Why did SP Tyagi name only so many people? rajeev tyaagi puch rahe hai ki kya tamaam prakriya main air marshall es pi tyaagi hi the
 Not only this, there were two Prime Ministers during the deal
 atal bihari vaajapeyi or manmohan singh
 Rajiv Tyagi says that it was during the Vajpayee period that the flight height of the helicopter was reduced from 6000 meters to 4500 meters
 agasta se pehle ek or helicopter kaa chayan hua tha i si 225 yah keval 6000 meter tak hi ud saktaa tha
 At the time it was thought that such a helicopter would form a single company, so there is no question that the same company was deliberately called in the tender, hence the PMO suggested that helicopters flying at low altitude could be considered
 raksha mantralay kii site par agasta westland se sambandhit jo jaankariyaan di gai hai usee se bataa rahaa hum
 It is there since Antony's time and this information is there in Parrikar's time
 raksha mantralay ke anusaar 19 november 2003 ke din pradhan sachiv ne pradhanmantri ke saath baithak kii
 At the same time, it was decided to increase the flight height to 4500
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki in badlaavon se kai companiyon ko tender main bhaag lene kaa mauka miltaa
 It is only after this that Augusta enters the process of the Westland deal
 uske saath teen or companiyaan hoti hai
 Two companies exit at the start of the process and two are left - Augusta and Cicrosky
 is deal main ek integrity claaj tha jiske anusaar koi bhi rishwat kaa maamla saamne aayega to na keval sauda radd hoga, balki jo paisa diya ja chukaa hoga use bhi zabt kar liya jayega
 The Sekrosky Company refused to sign the class and dropped out of the process
 agasta westland ke saath qaraar hua
 The Government of India canceled the deal and confiscated the money as soon as the brokerage was revealed
 1567 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha, lekin isse zyada kii rakam company se bharat ne vasuul lee
 But these things do not reveal who took the bribe
 italy kii adaalat ne rishwat dene kii baat sabit kii he
 The Government of India has also accepted the bribe, only then the deal was canceled and the money was recovered
 sawaal he rishwat kisne lee
 This thing is neither known from there nor from here
 qatl hua he ye sabit ho gaya he magar qatl kiskaa hua he yahi pataa nahin chal rahaa he
 If we see the record of the order, then the record of any government is not bad
 nateeja puuchhenge to ricard hi nahin milegaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been aggressive ever since this news appeared in the 'economic Times'
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki italy kii adaalat kaa faisla he
 This news has appeared in the media earlier, therefore it would not be right to accuse him of retaliation
 ye or baat he ki modi sarkaar se poocha ja rahaa he ki bharat main ho rahi jaanch kaa anjaam kab dekhne ko milegaa
 The Economic Times has written that Sinyora Gandhi's name appears four times in the judgment
 bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa ek patr jaanchakartaaon ko mila he jisase pataa chalata he ki is deal ke peeche cinyoraa gandhi mukhya shakti rahi hai
 Sinoyra in Italian means Smriti
 ek or bichauliye ne adaalat main congress netaa sonia gandhi kii tasviir kii pahchaan kii he
 Some of the middlemen have been pointing to some members of the Congress in confiscated notes
 naukarshahon or bhartiya vaayu sena ke adhikaron kii bhoomika ke bhi sanket milte hai
 Sonia Gandhi has said that there is no evidence
 ve kisi se nahin daratin
 What was the Modi government doing for two years
 buudhvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar kii suhasini haidar or josi joseph ne bichauliya chrishchiyan mishael kaa intervyuu kiya he
 It has been arrested once
 isane hindu akhbaar ko bataaya he ki main sonia gandhi se kabhi nahin mila hum, na kisi hotel yaa kisi party main
 It is a matter of luck that i have not been found
 mila hota to kehete ki maine kuch charchaa kii he
 Neither i have called, nor emailed, nor written the letter, nor sent the message
 unka kisi memo main naam bhi nahin he
 The question is also right whether this deal could have been done without the top leaders of the Congress or without the top ministers of the UPA government
 rishwat di gai he to kisi ke ishaare par hi di gai hogi, lee gai hogi
 This thing will be revealed only when there is a thorough investigation
 wo bhi samay se
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, Ahmed Patel and Oscar Fernandes, MK Narayanan, who was the NSA during the UPA, is also named
 sonia gandhi se lekar ahamed patel ne tamaam aaropon kaa khandan kiya he
 The BJP has said that at least Sonia Gandhi must respect the Italian court's decision
 congress ne bhi 10 sawaal puche hai
 There is another aspect in this case
 'hindu' akhbaar se isi james chrishchiyan mishael ne bolaa ki mujhe teen alag-alag sutron ne bataaya ki neuyark main bharat ke pradhanmantri or italy ke pradhanmantri ke bich chalate-chalate ek mulaakaat hui he
 In the Italian Marine case, the Prime Minister of India assured that he could help Italy if there was any evidence of the Gandhi family being implicated in the helicopter deal
 'hindu' akhbaar ne poocha ki kya saboot he ki meeting hui he
 Mitchell said that not only have they met, but the meeting lasted so long that the two had to change the time of their second meetings
 yah sab jab ho rahaa tha to rajdooton ne bataaya tha ki donon kii mulaakaat chal rahi he
 Mitchell asked the 'hindu' newspaper whether he had given in writing that the meeting did not take place
 is mulaakaat ke bare main 2 farvari 2016 kolkata se nikalne vaale akhbaar 'di telegraph' main is bare main khabar chhapi thi
 Mitchell wrote to the International Tribunal Court that the two Prime Ministers had met and the Prime Minister of India offered that the Marines would settle the dispute if some evidence was found about the Gandhi family
 antarrashtriya tribunel court main italy or bharat ke bich bharat main giraftaar do nausainikon kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 At the time the news was published that it is such a nonsense that even commenting is useless
 is baar bhi jab yah baat uthi to videsh mantralay ne apni yahi baat doharaai
 The Finance Minister also said that no such meeting has been held
 raajnneetik aarope to lag rahe hai
 The BJP has surrounded the Congress, but what will happen beyond politics? is maamle main jaanch kaa koi adhikrut states report to he nahin or na aisi koi report hoti he
 People want whoever is guilty is caught early
 kahin aisa na ho ki ishrat ke baad builder, bilderon kii thagi ke baad agasta, agasta ke baad kuch or maamla aa jaae or yah sab ek nura kushti banakar rah jaae
 Now there is a case of blacklisting agustawestland
 jaise hi e ke antni ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi blike list kar diya gaya tha, raksha mantri manohan parrikar ne chunauti de daali ki ki agar kiya he to dastauez dikhaaen
 Parrikar came to the media and told that the helicopter company was not banned at the time of AK Antony
 parrikar ke spashtikaran ke turant baad hi e ke antni blike list karne se neeche utar aae or prakriya shuru karne kii baat karne lage
 Look now prakriya shuru karne or bain karne main antar to he
 If AK Antony checked fast, it would not have happened
 tab congress bhi yah poochne lagi ki kyon agasta westland / finamakenika ko aapattiyon ke baavjood mek in india kaa hissaa banaaya gaya? kyon modi sarkaar ne agasta westland or tata ke joint venture ko helicopter banane kii manzuri di? kyon agasta westland ko 100 neval utility helicopter ke liye april 2015 main boli lagane di gai? The BJP has gained new energy from the decision of the Italian court that it can directly surround Sonia Gandhi in the corruption case
 sonia gandhi bhale saboot maang rahi hon lekin raajnneeti saboot kaa intazaar nahin karti
 It is true that the full copy of the judgment has not been read yet
 vahaan bharat kaa paksh nahin rakhaa gaya lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki agasta westland maamle main rishwat di gai he
 The matter of giving has been proved
 congress is sawaal ko chhod anya sawaalon ke zariye bijepi ko gherne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Questions are made but not as an answer to a bribe
 congress kaa kahana he ki chhattisgarh main bhi agasta se helicopter liya gaya he
 The CAG report stated that in 2007
 65
 70 lakh amareeki dollar kii is kharid ke liye dastauez is dhang se taiyaar kiye gaye taaki agasta westland ke alaava koi or company kharid prakriya main shaamil na ho paae
 Why is the Congress saying this now? lagaataar kyon nahin uthaai
 The comments 'diene' akhbaar ke deewakar anand ne likhaa he ki 10 farvari 2014 ko raksha mantralay ne agasta westland or finamaikanika ko blaclist kerani kii prakriya shuru kar di
 All the agreements with them were banned
 28 agast 2014 ko ek nai niti kaa aadesh aata he ki is tarah kii company ke saath kaisaa bartaav kiya jaae
 The order stated that there was no reason not to proceed with the agreement with finmanica Group
 usee aadesh main kaha gaya tha ki finamaikanika or sahyogiyon ko nae tender se alag rakhaa jayega
 Separate from the new tender and keep the old contract
 kya purna rup se pratibandh laga
 Is the answer to this question finally found? 11 farvari 2014 ke 'times aaf india' main yahi baat chhapi thi
 Many experts are saying that blacklisting Finmacanica is not easy
 3 april ko financial express main khabar chhapi he ki bharat sarkaar ne agasta westland ko 100 lite utility helicopter ke liye tender main bhaag lene kii anumati de di he
 The condition is that the company will have to partner with a local vendor
 agar ye baat sahi he to phir blike list kahaan hui
 Along with the leader officer, it is also coming to the fore that crores of rupees were spent to manage the media
 isliye sirf congress ke liye nahin media ke liye bhi jaanch zaruri he
 Who were managing journalists? balki company kii taraf se sarkaar ko hi manage kar rahe the
 Even today there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over Subramanian Swamy's talk
 unki baat ko karrwai se hataa to diya gaya lekin jo kaha suni hui usase lagata he ki is masale ko lekar bijepi congress ko chhodane vaali nahin he
 But what Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in response to this saying is interesting
 is baat kaa kya matlab he ki congress vaale jis skool main padhe hai uske nakvi ji master rahe hai
 This can be interpreted in many ways
 kya pataa wo yah kah rahe hai ki head master hone ke naate ham khub jaanate hai yaa jo aap karte hai wo ham aapse behatar kar sakate hai
 In 2013, Tyagi was clearly saying that the government was doing a fairly straightforward and clean job
 ab kya kahana he sarkaar ke bare main maaloom nahin magar pehle kii tarah ab bhi ve yahi kah rahe hai ki jo bhi badlaav hua wo raksha mantralay ke str par hua
 The Italian court has also said in its judgment that there is no evidence that Tyagi benefited agustawestland by changing the terms of flight sealing
 jab italy kii nichali adaalat ne unhen aarope mukt kiya tha tab tab hamaare raksha sampadak nitin gokhale se baat karte hue vayusena ke purv pramukh es ke tyaagi ne kaha tha ki dedh saal se tanaav main tha
 i have won lekin jab isi maheene milan ke hoicourt ne nichali adaalat kaa faisla palat kar yah kah diya ki tyaagi ko rishwat di gai he to hamaare sahyogi rajeev ranjan unke paas gaye
 SK Tyagi said that the copy of the verdict has not been received, so it would not be right to say anything
 air chif marshall ko rishwat kii rakam di gai he, yah aarope utani hi sharmnaak he jitani bhartiya netaaon kii rishwat diye jane kii baat
 It is important for the morale and image of the Air Force that the outcome of the investigation in SP Tyagi's case should come quickly
 khabar he ki pratyrpan nideshaalay unase poochtacha karne vaala he
 You might be thinking that this case will also be challenged in the Supreme Court of Italy
 ho saktaa he di jaae, magar vahaan kaa supreme court cese ke tathyon or sabooton par dobaaraa se vichaar nahin karata he
 The Supreme Court will only conduct a legal review
 2012 main jab yah maamla uthaa tha uske duusare din hi raksha mantralay ne italy ke duutavas se tathyon kaa pataa lagane kaa aadesh diya tha
 On 12 February 2013, the Ministry of Defense hands over the case to the CBI
 janvari 2014 main bharat ne deal cancil kar di
 Three helicopters of Augusta were confiscated
 bharat ne guarantee ke rup main agasta ko jo paise diye the use jabt kar liya
 The CBI and the Extradition Directorate are also investigating in India
 sibiai ne kaha he ki bharat kii taraf se jaanch kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa he
 The statements of all the witnesses have been recorded
 aath deshon main letters aaf rogetary bheja gaya he
 This letter is written to the courts of other countries for cooperation
 abhi tak italy, british virgin island, euke, tunisia se jawaab aa gaya he
 Right now we are reading the information coming from there
 kathith bichauliya maaikel ke khilaaf red carnor notice jari kar diya he
 The CBI is also saying that informal copies of the verdict have been got translated
 raksha mantralay bhi anuwaad kara rahaa he
 The Ministry of Defense has said that it will take seven to eight days to translate
 sochiye 225 pej ke anuwaad main haftaa lagegaa to 90 hazaar pannon ke anuwaad main kitna vakt laga hoga, agar anuwaad ho gaya hoga to
 About which i am not aware
 sibiai ne bich main tyaagi bros se poochtacha kii he
 Everyone has seen a bank record of 10-12 years
 air marshall es pi tyaagi se pehle bhi poochtacha ho chuki he or pratyrpan nideshaalay ne kaha he ki phir poochtacha hogi
 It is said that even the CBI has not found strong evidence that money has come to them or not
 espi tyaagi ke bhai rajeev tyaagi kahana he ki agasta westland ke tender se lekar deal hone tak paanch air chif hue, chaar raksha sachiv aae or chale gaye
 Two National Security Advisers came and went
 do raksha mantri bhi aae or chale gaye
 Pranab Mukherjee and AK Antony
 itane logon ke kya sirf es pi tyaagi kaa hi naam kyon aayaa
 Rajiv Tyagi is asking if Air Marshal SP Tyagi was the only one in the process
 yahi nahin deal ke dauraan do pradhanmantri ho gaye
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh
 rajeev tyaagi kaa kahana he ki vaajapeyi kaal main hi helicopter ke udaan kii oonchai 6000 meter se ghataakar 4500 kiya gaya
 Before Augusta, another helicopter was selected EC 225 It could fly up to 6000 meters only
 us samay sochaa gaya ki aisa helicopter ek hi company banaati he, lihaaza sawaal na khadaa ho jaae ki ek hi company ko jaanboojh kar tender main bulaayaa gaya, isliye piemo ne suzav diya ki kam oonchai par udne vaale helicopter par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 i am telling you the information related to agustawestland on the site of the Ministry of Defense
 antni ke samay se hi vahaan he or parrikar ke samay main yahi jaankaree he
 According to the Ministry of Defense, on 19 November 2003, the Principal Secretary held a meeting with the Prime Minister
 vahiin faisla hua ki udaan kii oonchai 4500 kar di jaae
 This was done because these changes would allow many companies to participate in the tender
 iske baad hi agasta westland deal kii prakriya main pravesh karata he
 He is accompanied by three more companies
 do companiyaan prakriya kii shuruuaat main hi baahar ho jaati hai or do batch jaati hai- agasta or sikroski
 There was an Integrity Clause in this deal, according to which any bribery case will come up, not only will the deal be canceled, but the money that has been paid will also be confiscated
 sikroski company ne is claaj par sin karne se manaa kar diya or wo is prakriya se baahar ho gai
 Agreed with agustawestland
 dallali kii baat saamne aate hi bharat sarkaar ne sauda radd kar diya or paisa bhi zabt kar liya
 Rs 1567 crore was paid, but more than that was recovered by India from the company
 magar in baton se yah nahin pataa chalata ki kisne rishwat lee
 The Italian court has proved the bribe
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi rishwat diye jane kii baat maani he tabhi to sauda radd kiya gaya or paisa vasula gaya
 The question is who took the bribe
 yah baat na vahaan se pataa chalati he na yahaan se
 It has been proved that the murder has happened, but whose murder is not known
 aadesh kaa ricard dekhenge to kisi bhi sarkaar kaa ricard karaab nahin he
 If you ask the result, you will not get a record
 jab se yah khabar 'iconomik times' main chhapi he tab se bhartiya janata party aakraamak he
 The BJP says that the Italian court has decided
 media main yah khabar pehle chhapi he isliye us par badale kii karrwai kaa aarope lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 It is another matter that the Modi government is being asked when the outcome of the investigation going on in India will be seen
 'iconomik times' ne likhaa he ki faisle main cinyoraa gandhi kaa naam chaar baar aayaa he
 Investigators have received a letter from middleman Christian Mitchell, indicating that Sinora Gandhi was the main force behind the deal
 italian main cinyoraa kaa matlab shrimati hota he
 Another middleman has identified the picture of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi in the court
 kai saare bichauliyon se zabt note main congress ke kuch sadasyon kii taraf ishaara ho rahaa he
 There are also indications of the role of bureaucrats and the rights of the Indian Air Force
 sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki koi saboot nahin he
 She is not afraid of anyone
 modi sarkaar do saal se kya kar rahi thi
 On Wednesday, Suhasini Haider and Josie Joseph of 'hindu' newspaper interviewed middleman Christian Mitchell
 yah ek baar giraftaar ho chukaa he
 It has told the Hindu newspaper that i have never met Sonia Gandhi, nor in any hotel or any party
 bhagya kii baat he ki nahin mila hum
 If i had met, i would have said that i have discussed something
 na maine phone kiya he, na email kiya he, na letters likhaa he, na massej kiya he
 He is not even named in any memo
 yah sawaal vaazib bhi he ki kya congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bina yaa upie sarkaar ke sheersh mantriyon ke bina yah deal ho sakati thi
 If a bribe has been given, it would have been given at the behest of someone, it would have been taken
 yah baat tabhi saamne aegi jab isaki pukhta jaanch hogi
 From that time too
 manmohan singh, ahamed patel or auskar furnandis ke alaava upie ke vakt enese rahe emke narayanan kaa bhi naam he
 From Sonia Gandhi to Ahmed Patel, all the allegations have been denied
 bijepi ne kaha he ki kam se kam sonia gandhi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisale kaa sammaan to karnaa hi chahie
 Congress has also asked 10 questions
 is maamle main ek or pahalu he
 The same James Christian Mitchell told the 'hindu' newspaper that three different sources told me that there was a meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Italy in New York
 italian marine cese maamle main bharat ke pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan diya ki ve italy kii madad kar sakate hai agar helicopter saude main gandhi parivaar ko fansaane kaa koi saboot mil jaae to
 The Hindu newspaper asked if there was any evidence that the meeting had taken place
 mishael ne kaha ki na sirf mulaakaat hui he, balki itani der chal mulaakaat chali ki donon ko apni duusari baithkon ke samay main badlaav karnaa padaa tha
 When all this was happening, the ambassadors had told that the two were meeting
 mishael ne 'hindu' akhbaar se poocha ki kya unhone likhit rup main diya he ki mulaakaat nahin
 The news about this meeting was published in the newspaper 'the Telegraph' originating from Kolkata on 2 February 2016
 mishael ne antarrashtriya tribunel court ko likhaa tha ki donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich mulaakaat hui he or bharat ke pradhanmantri ne peshkash kii he ki agar gandhi parivaar ke bare main kuch saboot mil jaae to marine vivaad ko sulajhaa denge
 The case of two marines arrested in India is going on between Italy and India in the International Tribunal Court
 jis vakt khabar chhapi thi ki ye itani bakawaas baat he ki coment karnaa bhi bekaar he
 This time also when this matter arose, the Ministry of External Affairs repeated the same thing
 sadan main vitt mantri ne bhi kaha ki aisi koi mulaakaat nahin hui he
 Political allegations are being made
 bijepi ne congress ko gher to liya he lekin kya baat raajnneeti se bhi aage badhegi
 In this case, there is no official status report of inquiry and there is no such report
 log chaahate hai ki jo bhi doshi he wo jaldi pakadaa jaae
 It should not happen that after Ishrat, the builder, after the cheating of the builders, Augusta, after Augusta, some other issue will come and it all becomes a nura wrestling
 ab ek maamla he agasta westland ko blike list karne kaa
 As soon as AK Antony said that he was blacklisted during his tenure, Defense Minister Manohan Parrikar challenged that the documents be shown if done
 parrikar media ke saamne aae or bataa diya ki e ke antni ke samay helicopter company ko bain nahin kiya gaya tha
 Soon after Parrikar's clarification, AK Antony came down from the black list and started talking about starting the process
 ab dekhiye
 There is a difference between starting and banning the process
 e ke antni agar tezi se se jaanch karte to ye naubat nahin aati
 The Congress then started asking why agustawestland / Finnamica was made a part of Make in India despite objections? Why did the Modi government allow agustawestland and Tata's joint venture to make helicopters? Why agustawestland was allowed to bid for 100 Naval Utility Helicopters in April 2015? bijepi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisle se nai urja mili he ki iske zariye sonia gandhi ko bhrashtachar ke maamle main sidhe sidhe gheraa ja saktaa he
 Sonia Gandhi may be asking for proof but politics does not wait for proof
 sahi he ki faisle kii puri copy abhi tak nahin padhi gai he
 India's favor was not kept there but it is also a fact that bribe has been given in the agustawestland case
 dene kii baat sabit ho chuki he
 Except this question, the Congress is trying to surround the BJP through other questions
 sawaal to banate hai magar rishwat vaale sawaal ke jawaab ke rup main nahin
 The Congress says that chopper has been taken from Agusta in Chhattisgarh too
 sieji kii report ne kaha he ki 2007 main 65
 Documents for this purchase of US $ 7 million were prepared in such a way that no company other than agustawestland was involved in the procurement process
 yah baat congress abhi kyon kah rahi he
 Why did not you constantly lift
 tippaniyan Diwakar Anand of the 'DNA' newspaper wrote that on 10 February 2014, the Ministry of Defense started the process of blacklisting agustawestland and Finmanica
 inke saath hue saare qaraar par roak laga di thi
 On August 28, 2014, a new policy order comes in how to treat such a company
 is aadesh main likhaa tha ki koi kaaran nahin he ki finamaikanika group ke saath hue qaraar ke saath aage na badha jaae
 The same order stated that Finmacanica and allies would be excluded from the new tender
 nae tender se alag bhi rakhana he or puraane qaraar ko jari bhi rakhana he
 Is there a complete ban
 kya is sawaal kaa jawaab antim rup se mil gaya he
 The same thing appeared in 'times of India' on 11 February 2014
 kai jaankaar kah rahe hai ki finamaikanika ko blike list karnaa aasaan nahin he
 On 3 April, Financial Express reported that the Indian government had allowed agustawestland to participate in the tender for 100 light utility helicopters
 shart he ki company ko kisi sthaneey vendor se saajheedaari kerani hogi
 If this is true, then where is the black list? netaa adhikari ke saath-saath yah baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki karodon rupee media manage karne ke liye bhi kharch kiye gaye
 Therefore, investigation is important not only for the Congress but also for the media
 koun koun patrkaar manage ho rahe the
 Rather, they were managing the government on behalf of the company
 aaj bhi rajya sabha main subramanyam swami kii baat ko lekar hangaamaa ho gaya
 His point was dropped from the action, but from what he heard, it seems that BJP is not going to leave the Congress on this issue
 lekin is kahasuni ke jawaab main jo kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kah gaye wo dilachasp he
 What does this mean that Naqvi has been the master of the school where the Congressmen are studying
 isaki vyakhya kai roopon main kii ja sakati he
 Do you know what they are saying that as Head Master we know a lot or what you do, we can do better than you
 air chif marshall ko rishwat kii rakam di gai he, yah aarope utani hi sharmnaak he jitani bhartiya netaaon kii rishwat diye jane kii baat
 It is important for the morale and image of the Air Force that the outcome of the investigation in SP Tyagi's case should come quickly
 khabar he ki pratyrpan nideshaalay unase poochtacha karne vaala he
 You might be thinking that this case will also be challenged in the Supreme Court of Italy

 tippaniyan Diwakar Anand of the 'DNA' newspaper wrote that on 10 February 2014, the Ministry of Defense started the process of blacklisting agustawestland and Finmanica
 inke saath hue saare qaraar par roak laga di thi
 On August 28, 2014, a new policy order comes in how to treat such a company
 is aadesh main likhaa tha ki koi kaaran nahin he ki finamaikanika group ke saath hue qaraar ke saath aage na badha jaae
 The same order stated that Finmacanica and allies would be excluded from the new tender
 nae tender se alag bhi rakhana he or puraane qaraar ko jari bhi rakhana he
 Is there a complete ban
 kya is sawaal kaa jawaab antim rup se mil gaya he
 The same thing appeared in 'times of India' on 11 February 2014
 kai jaankaar kah rahe hai ki finamaikanika ko blike list karnaa aasaan nahin he
 On 3 April, Financial Express reported that the Indian government had allowed agustawestland to participate in the tender for 100 light utility helicopters
 shart he ki company ko kisi sthaneey vendor se saajheedaari kerani hogi
 If this is true, then where is the black list? netaa adhikari ke saath-saath yah baat bhi saamne aa rahi he ki karodon rupee media manage karne ke liye bhi kharch kiye gaye
 Therefore, investigation is important not only for the Congress but also for the media
 koun koun patrkaar manage ho rahe the
 Rather, they were managing the government on behalf of the company
 aaj bhi rajya sabha main subramanyam swami kii baat ko lekar hangaamaa ho gaya
 His point was dropped from the action, but from what he heard, it seems that BJP is not going to leave the Congress on this issue
 lekin is kahasuni ke jawaab main jo kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kah gaye wo dilachasp he
 What does this mean that Naqvi has been the master of the school where the Congressmen are studying
 isaki vyakhya kai roopon main kii ja sakati he
 Do you know what they are saying that as Head Master we know a lot or what you do, we can do better than you
 2012 main jab yah maamla uthaa tha uske duusare din hi raksha mantralay ne italy ke duutavas se tathyon kaa pataa lagane kaa aadesh diya tha
 On 12 February 2013, the Ministry of Defense hands over the case to the CBI
 janvari 2014 main bharat ne deal cancil kar di
 Three helicopters of Augusta were confiscated
 bharat ne guarantee ke rup main agasta ko jo paise diye the use jabt kar liya
 The CBI and the Extradition Directorate are also investigating in India
 sibiai ne kaha he ki bharat kii taraf se jaanch kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa he
 The statements of all the witnesses have been recorded
 aath deshon main letters aaf rogetary bheja gaya he
 This letter is written to the courts of other countries for cooperation
 abhi tak italy, british virgin island, euke, tunisia se jawaab aa gaya he
 Right now we are reading the information coming from there
 kathith bichauliya maaikel ke khilaaf red carnor notice jari kar diya he
 The CBI is also saying that informal copies of the verdict have been got translated
 raksha mantralay bhi anuwaad kara rahaa he
 The Ministry of Defense has said that it will take seven to eight days to translate
 sochiye 225 pej ke anuwaad main haftaa lagegaa to 90 hazaar pannon ke anuwaad main kitna vakt laga hoga, agar anuwaad ho gaya hoga to
 About which i am not aware
 sibiai ne bich main tyaagi bros se poochtacha kii he
 Everyone has seen a bank record of 10-12 years
 air marshall es pi tyaagi se pehle bhi poochtacha ho chuki he or pratyrpan nideshaalay ne kaha he ki phir poochtacha hogi
 It is said that even the CBI has not found strong evidence that money has come to them or not
 espi tyaagi ke bhai rajeev tyaagi kahana he ki agasta westland ke tender se lekar deal hone tak paanch air chif hue, chaar raksha sachiv aae or chale gaye
 Two National Security Advisers came and went
 do raksha mantri bhi aae or chale gaye
 Pranab Mukherjee and AK Antony
 itane logon ke kya sirf es pi tyaagi kaa hi naam kyon aayaa
 Rajiv Tyagi is asking if Air Marshal SP Tyagi was the only one in the process
 yahi nahin deal ke dauraan do pradhanmantri ho gaye
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh
 rajeev tyaagi kaa kahana he ki vaajapeyi kaal main hi helicopter ke udaan kii oonchai 6000 meter se ghataakar 4500 kiya gaya
 Before Augusta, another helicopter was selected EC 225 It could fly up to 6000 meters only
 us samay sochaa gaya ki aisa helicopter ek hi company banaati he, lihaaza sawaal na khadaa ho jaae ki ek hi company ko jaanboojh kar tender main bulaayaa gaya, isliye piemo ne suzav diya ki kam oonchai par udne vaale helicopter par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 i am telling you the information related to agustawestland on the site of the Ministry of Defense
 antni ke samay se hi vahaan he or parrikar ke samay main yahi jaankaree he
 According to the Ministry of Defense, on 19 November 2003, the Principal Secretary held a meeting with the Prime Minister
 vahiin faisla hua ki udaan kii oonchai 4500 kar di jaae
 This was done because these changes would allow many companies to participate in the tender
 iske baad hi agasta westland deal kii prakriya main pravesh karata he
 He is accompanied by three more companies
 do companiyaan prakriya kii shuruuaat main hi baahar ho jaati hai or do batch jaati hai- agasta or sikroski
 There was an Integrity Clause in this deal, according to which any bribery case will come up, not only will the deal be canceled, but the money that has been paid will also be confiscated
 sikroski company ne is claaj par sin karne se manaa kar diya or wo is prakriya se baahar ho gai
 Agreed with agustawestland
 dallali kii baat saamne aate hi bharat sarkaar ne sauda radd kar diya or paisa bhi zabt kar liya
 Rs 1567 crore was paid, but more than that was recovered by India from the company
 magar in baton se yah nahin pataa chalata ki kisne rishwat lee
 The Italian court has proved the bribe
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi rishwat diye jane kii baat maani he tabhi to sauda radd kiya gaya or paisa vasula gaya
 The question is who took the bribe
 yah baat na vahaan se pataa chalati he na yahaan se
 It has been proved that the murder has happened, but whose murder is not known
 aadesh kaa ricard dekhenge to kisi bhi sarkaar kaa ricard karaab nahin he
 If you ask the result, you will not get a record
 jab se yah khabar 'iconomik times' main chhapi he tab se bhartiya janata party aakraamak he
 The BJP says that the Italian court has decided
 media main yah khabar pehle chhapi he isliye us par badale kii karrwai kaa aarope lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 It is another matter that the Modi government is being asked when the outcome of the investigation going on in India will be seen
 'iconomik times' ne likhaa he ki faisle main cinyoraa gandhi kaa naam chaar baar aayaa he
 Investigators have received a letter from middleman Christian Mitchell, indicating that Sinora Gandhi was the main force behind the deal
 italian main cinyoraa kaa matlab shrimati hota he
 Another middleman has identified the picture of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi in the court
 kai saare bichauliyon se zabt note main congress ke kuch sadasyon kii taraf ishaara ho rahaa he
 There are also indications of the role of bureaucrats and the rights of the Indian Air Force
 sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki koi saboot nahin he
 She is not afraid of anyone
 modi sarkaar do saal se kya kar rahi thi
 On Wednesday, Suhasini Haider and Josie Joseph of 'hindu' newspaper interviewed middleman Christian Mitchell
 yah ek baar giraftaar ho chukaa he
 It has told the Hindu newspaper that i have never met Sonia Gandhi, nor in any hotel or any party
 bhagya kii baat he ki nahin mila hum
 If i had met, i would have said that i have discussed something
 na maine phone kiya he, na email kiya he, na letters likhaa he, na massej kiya he
 He is not even named in any memo
 yah sawaal vaazib bhi he ki kya congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bina yaa upie sarkaar ke sheersh mantriyon ke bina yah deal ho sakati thi
 If a bribe has been given, it would have been given at the behest of someone, it would have been taken
 yah baat tabhi saamne aegi jab isaki pukhta jaanch hogi
 From that time too
 manmohan singh, ahamed patel or auskar furnandis ke alaava upie ke vakt enese rahe emke narayanan kaa bhi naam he
 From Sonia Gandhi to Ahmed Patel, all the allegations have been denied
 bijepi ne kaha he ki kam se kam sonia gandhi ko italy kii adaalat ke faisale kaa sammaan to karnaa hi chahie
 Congress has also asked 10 questions
 is maamle main ek or pahalu he
 The same James Christian Mitchell told the 'hindu' newspaper that three different sources told me that there was a meeting between the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of Italy in New York
 italian marine cese maamle main bharat ke pradhanmantri ne aashwaasan diya ki ve italy kii madad kar sakate hai agar helicopter saude main gandhi parivaar ko fansaane kaa koi saboot mil jaae to
 The Hindu newspaper asked if there was any evidence that the meeting had taken place
 mishael ne kaha ki na sirf mulaakaat hui he, balki itani der chal mulaakaat chali ki donon ko apni duusari baithkon ke samay main badlaav karnaa padaa tha
 When all this was happening, the ambassadors had told that the two were meeting
 mishael ne 'hindu' akhbaar se poocha ki kya unhone likhit rup main diya he ki mulaakaat nahin
 The news about this meeting was published in the newspaper 'the Telegraph' originating from Kolkata on 2 February 2016
 mishael ne antarrashtriya tribunel court ko likhaa tha ki donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich mulaakaat hui he or bharat ke pradhanmantri ne peshkash kii he ki agar gandhi parivaar ke bare main kuch saboot mil jaae to marine vivaad ko sulajhaa denge
 The case of two marines arrested in India is going on between Italy and India in the International Tribunal Court
 jis vakt khabar chhapi thi ki ye itani bakawaas baat he ki coment karnaa bhi bekaar he
 This time also when this matter arose, the Ministry of External Affairs repeated the same thing
 sadan main vitt mantri ne bhi kaha ki aisi koi mulaakaat nahin hui he
 Political allegations are being made
 bijepi ne congress ko gher to liya he lekin kya baat raajnneeti se bhi aage badhegi
 In this case, there is no official status report of inquiry and there is no such report
 log chaahate hai ki jo bhi doshi he wo jaldi pakadaa jaae
 It should not happen that after Ishrat, the builder, after the cheating of the builders, Augusta, after Augusta, some other issue will come and it all becomes a nura wrestling
 ab ek maamla he agasta westland ko blike list karne kaa
 As soon as AK Antony said that he was blacklisted during his tenure, Defense Minister Manohan Parrikar challenged that the documents be shown if done
 parrikar media ke saamne aae or bataa diya ki e ke antni ke samay helicopter company ko bain nahin kiya gaya tha
 Soon after Parrikar's clarification, AK Antony came down from the black list and started talking about starting the process
 ab dekhiye
 There is a difference between starting and banning the process
 e ke antni agar tezi se se jaanch karte to ye naubat nahin aati
