 Bhrigu came to see him - but Nandi did not let him go inside the cave
 bhrigu ne shaap diya, par nandi nirvikaar rup se maarg roke rahe
 Such was the order of shiva-parvati
 ek baar ravan ne apane haath par kailash parvat uthaa liya tha
 Nandi got angry and put such pressure with her foot that Ravana's hand was suppressed
 jab tak usne shiv kii aradhana nahin kii tathaa nandi se kshamaa nahin maangi, nandi ne use choda hi nahin

 Kabir or Bhagat Kabir was a 15th century Indian mystic poet and saint
 ve hindi sahitya ke bhaktikalin yug main gyanashrayi-nirgun shakha kii kavyadhara ke pravartak the
 His compositions influenced the Bhakti movement of the Hindi state to a deeper level

 He was a critic of Hinduism and Islam
 unhone saamaajik andhvishwaas kii ninda kii or saamaajik buraaiyon kii sakht aalochana kii thi
 During his lifetime both Hindus and Muslims threatened him for his views
 kabir panth naamak dharmik sampradaay inaki shikshaaon ke anuyaayi hai
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars about the place of birth, but most scholars consider their birth in Kashi only, which also confirms this statement of Kabir himself
 kabir ke guru ke sambandh main prachlit kathan he ki kabir ko upyukt guru kii talash thi
 He wanted to make Vaishnava saint Acharya Ramanand his master but he refused to make Kabir a disciple but Kabir decided in his mind to make Swami Ramananda his master at all costs, for this, a thought in Kabir's mind He came that Swami Ramanand ji goes to bathe in the Ganges at four o'clock in the morning before he will lie down the stairs on his way and he did so
 ek din, ek pahar raat rahete hi kabir panchganga ghat kii sidhiyon par gir pade
 Ramanand ji was descending the stairs to perform Gangesan, when his foot fell on Kabir's body
 unke mukh se tatkaal 'ram-ram' shabd nikal padaa
 Kabir accepted the same Rama as the deeksha-mantra and accepted Ramanand ji as his guru
 kabir ke hi shabdon main- Kabir used to work as a weaver to earn a living
 kabir kii drudh manyata thi ki karmon ke anusaar hi gati milti he sthaan vishesh ke kaaran nahin
 He went to Maghar at the end of time to prove his belief; because people believed that one dies in Kashi and one gets heaven when Maghar dies
 magahar main unhone antim saans lee
 Even today the tomb and mausoleum are located there
 kabir kii bhashaa sadhukkadi he
 Their language includes the language of all the dialects of Hindi language
 rajasthani, haryaanavi, punjabi, khadi boli, avadhi, brajabhasha ke shabdon kii bahulata he
 The disciples collected their works in a book titled "bijak" which has three main parts: Sakhi, Sabad, Ramani sadhu santon kaa to ghar main jamaavada rahata hi tha
 Kabir was not educated - 'don't touch my paper, i don't touch a pen
 'unhone swayan granth nahin likhe, munh se bhakhe or unke shishyon ne use likh liya
 The glory of Ramnama is echoed in all your thoughts
 ve ek hi ishwar ko maanate the or karmkand ke ghor virdohi the
 They did not consider avatar, idol, Roza, Eid, Masjid, temple etc
 ve kabhi kehete hai- 'harimor Piu, i am Ram's daughter-in-law', sometimes say, 'hari janani main balak tora'
 or kabhi "bada hua to kya hua jaisai" At that time, the Hindu public was affected by the terror of Muslim terror
 kabir ne apane panth ko is dhang se suniyojit kiya jisase muslim mat kii ore jhuki hui janata sahaj hi inaki anuyaayi ho gayi
 He kept his language simple and comprehensible so that it could reach the common man
 isse donon sampradaayon ke paraspar milan main suvidha hui
 Their creeds were against Muslim culture and cow-feeding
 kabir ko shantimay jivan priy tha or ve ahimsa, satya, sadachaar aadi gunon ke prashansak the
 Today, due to his simplicity, saintly nature and saintly tendency, he is also being respected abroad

 There was a small temple of Ramakrishna

 He exchanged views with Sant Kabir
 kabir kii ek saakhi ne un ke man par gaharaa asar kiya- 'ban te bhaga bhirahe bhi bhi bhi, moan apni baan karaha bedan kaason kahe, ko karaha ko jaan
 
 ' Who should tell the elephant who has fallen in the pit lost by the fowler while running from the forest? saransh yah ki dharm kii jigyaasa sein prerit ho kar bhagwaan gosai apana ghar chhod kar baahar to nikal aaye or harivyasi sampradaay ke gadde main gir kar akele nirvasit ho kar asanvaadya sthiti main pad chuke hai
 Targeting the idol worship, he made a appearance - paahan puuje hari milain, to main poojon pahaar

 Kabir's Rama is unknowable and resides in every particle of the world
 kabir ke ram islam ke akeshwarwadi, eksattavadi khuda bhi nahin hai
 In Islam, Khuda or Allah is believed to be different from entire world and creatures and supremely capable
 par kabir ke ram param samarth bhale hon, lekin samast jeevon or jagat se bhinn to kadaapi nahin hai
 Rather, on the contrary, they are the prevalent Ramta Ram
 vah kehete hainvyapak brahm sabanimain ekai, ko pandit ko jogi
 ravana-rao Kavansun Kavan Veda
 kabir ram kii kisi khaas roopakriti kii kalpana nahin karte, kyonki roopakriti kii kalpana karte hi ram kisi khaas dhaanche main bandh jate, jo kabir ko kisi bhi haalat main manjuur nahin
 Kabir wanted to give a different and broader form to the concept of Ram
 iske kuch vishesh kaaran the, jinaki charchaa ham is lekh main aage karenge
 But despite this, Kabir definitely establishes a personal family type relationship with Ram
 ram ke saath unka prem unki alokik or mahimashali satta ko ek kshan bhi bhulaae bagaiyr sahaj premparak maanviya sambandhon ke dharaatal par pratishthit he
 Kabir believes in the name, not the form
 haalaanki bhakthi-samvednaa ke siddhanton main yah baat saamaanya rup se pratishthit he ki ‘naam rup se badhkar he’, lekin kabir ne is saamaanya siddhant kaa kranthidharmee upyog kiya
 Kabir, with the name Ram, gave a sublime and comprehensive look to the centuries-old synthetic sentiments created in Lokmanya and tried to prevent him from being tied to the mythology-propounded Brahminical ideology
 kabir ke ram nirgun-sagun ke bhed se pare hai
 In fact, he used the word 'nirgun Rama' - 'nirgun Rama Japahu Re Bhai' to separate his Rama from Rastra, the patron of the scripturally-rendered Avatari, Saguna, dominant Varnashrama system
 ’ is ‘nirgun’ shabd ko lekar bhram main padane kii jarurat nahin
 Kabir means just this word that God cannot be bound within the boundaries of any name, form, quality, time etc
 jo sari simaaon se pare hai or phir bhi sarvatra hai, vahi kabir ke nirgun ram hai
 He named it 'ramta Ram'
 apane ram ko nirgun visheshan dene ke baavjood kabir unke saath maanviya prem sambandhon kii tarah ke rishte kii baat karte hai
 Sometimes he considers Rama as his lover or husband, and sometimes he is a lord in the sense of bondage
 kabhi-kabhi vah ram ko vatsalya murti ke rup main maan maan lete hai or khud ko unka putr
 This kind of succulent, spontaneous, human love is unique to Kabir's devotion even with the nirgun-formless Brahm
 yah duvidha or samasya dusron ko bhale ho sakati he ki jis ram ke saath kabir itane anany, maanviya sambandhparak prem karte hon, vah bhala nirgun kaise ho sakate hai, par khud kabir ke liye yah samasya nahin he
 He also says, "santou, tell me cheating
 gunamem nirgun, nirgunamem gun, baat chhandi kyun bahise!”nahin he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while expressing his views regarding Kabir's spiritual practice of Ram and Kabir, said: "kabir's entire life was spent in the search for truth and refutation of the truth
 kabir kii sadhana ‘‘maanane se nahin, ‘‘jaanane se armbh hoti he
 He is not a disciple of anyone, but a disciple warned by Ramanand
 unke liye ram rup nahin he, dasharathi ram nahin he, unke ram to naam sadhana ke pratik hai
 His Rama is not imprisoned within the boundaries of any sect, caste or country
 prakruti ke kan-kan main, ang-ang main raman karne par bhi jise anang sparsh nahin kar saktaa, ve alakh, avinashi, param tatv hi ram hai
 His Rama is not a discriminator between man and man
 ve to prem tatv ke pratik hai
 Rising above the sense of love or worship are: ‘prem jagaavai virah ko, virah jagaavai piu, piu jagaavai jeev ko, joi piu soi jiu' - jo piu he, vahi jeev he
 That is why his whole practice is the practice of "hans Ubaran Aaya"
 is hans kaa ubaarana pothiyon ke padhane se nahin ho saktaa, dhai aakhar prem ke aacharan se hi ho saktaa he
 Religion is not a matter of wear and tear, it is a continuous practice of conduct in life
 unki sadhana prem se armbh hoti he
 Love it so deeply that God becomes divine for you
 usko paane kii itani utkantha ho jaae ki sabase vairaygy ho jaae, virah bhav ho jaae tabhi us dhyaan samadhi main piu jaagrath ho saktaa he
 That same Pew can awaken a creature sitting in your heart
 joi piu he soi jiu he
 Then you will love the world, the world will become an object of your love for each organism
 sara ahankaar, sara dwesh dur ho jayega
 Then great spirit will arise
 isi mahabhaav se puraa sansar piu kaa ghar ho jaataa he

 so successful in his efforts to restore peace and confidence that within less than a year some three hundred deserted towns and villages were re-peopled, trade revived, and, in spite of the abolition of transit duties and the reduction of frontier customs, the state revenue had reached an amount never before known
 During the next five years Tod earned the respect of both the chiefs and the people; and was able to rescue more than one princely family, including that of the ranas of Udaipur, from the destitution to which they had been reduced by Mahratta raiders

 utak vigyaan yaa ootiki kii paribhaasha dete hue storer ne likhaa he : utak vigyaan yaa sookshm sharir angon ke bheetar utakon kii sanrachana tathaa unke vinyas ke adhyayan ko kehete hai
 The term histology of English is formed from the Greek words histos and logia, which means the study of tissues
 at: utak vigyaan vah vigyaan he, jiske antargat utakon kii sookshm sanrachana tathaa unki vyavastha athwa vinyas kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The word 'tissue' derives from the French word tissue, meaning structure or texture
 is shabd kaa prayog sarvapratham francisi sharir vaigyanik billit ne 18veen shatabdi ke ant main sharir yaa sharir-rachana vigyaan ke prasang main kiya tha
 He mentions about b type of tissues in his book
 kintu, aajkal keval chaar prakaar ke mukhya utakon ko manyata praapt he, jinke naam hai : ipithiliyami, sanyojak, peshiy or tantrikeey utak 
 Since time immemorial, humans have been identifying animals, birds and plants by their shape and size
 vigyaan ke vikaas ke saath vanaspatiyon tathaa jantuon ke sharir ke bheetar kii sanrachana jaanane kii bhi jigyaasa utpann hoti gai
 This curiosity led to the development of surgery
 chikitsa tathaa jeevvaigyanikon ne pashu or vanaspatiyon kii cheerfaad karke unke ang kii sanrachanaon-ang prataangon-kaa adhyayan aarambh kiya
 This study resulted in the creation of the entire body
 isi ke saath jab sookshmdarshi yantron kaa vikaas hua to jatil aantarik sanrachanaayen bhi spasht hoti gai
 This microscopic mechanical study has been termed as Physics
 at: bloom tathaa foset ke shabdon main 'ootiki yaa sookshmdarshi sharir ke antargat sharir kii vah aantarik sanrachana aati he jo nangi aankhon se nahin dikhalaai detii
 The structural and functional unit of all living beings is cells
 isi koshika ke adhyayan ko koshika vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 The mass of cells consists of tissues and the formation of organs from tissues
 utakon kii sanrachana kaa adhyayan karanevaale vigyaan ko autikee tathaa angon kii sanrachana kaa adhyayan karanevaale vigyaan ko sharir kehete hai
 Due to the study of optics and cytology, the intractable mysteries of the body got penetrated
 in donon ke sanmilit adhyayan se ootiki-rog-vigyaan kaa vikaas hua
 In 1932, Knoll and Ruska invented the electron microscope, which explained the complex structures of cells and tissues
 isi ke saath saath sharirkriyavigyaan kaa bhi vikaas hota gaya or nae nae rahasyon kaa niraavaran sambhav hua
 Thus, the combined effort of these three sciences has brought unprecedented revolution in the field of biology
 ootiki or koshikavigyaan mukhya rup se sookshm sanrachanaon ke aakaarkiya swaroop ko spasht karte hai
 But since the discovery of aniline pigments, the complex structures of cells have also started to be gained
 aaj sainkadon prakaar ke ranjakon kaa prayog karke sookshm se sookshm sanrachanaon par prakaash daalaa ja rahaa he
 Thus, chemistry has now entered the field of energy
 bhanti bhanti ke sthayikaron ke prayog se ranjakon kii rasinic pratikriyaaon kaa samuchit gyaan praapt ho rahaa he
 Knowledge of organisms, cytoplasm and the chemical structures of many organelles in them and cells is now accessible to the general public
 ye angak kis prakaar visheshikrut kaary sampadit karte hai, yah ab agyaat nahin rah gaya
 The study of the chemical nature of microstructures is called ocytochemistry or cytochemistry, and now optics and oxytochemicals are studied together
 hellen dean ke matanusaar is prakaar kii adhyayanvidhiyon kii teen pramukh kotiyaan hai: Bailey's book on the subject of optics emphasizes on histology as well as cell scientific studies
 beli ke matanusaar, chunki utak-vigyaan sanrachana sambandhi adhyayan he or vichchhedan dwaara praapt sharirarachana sambandhi gyaan kii purti karata he, at: iske sharir-kriya-vigyaan tathaa rogavigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh par bhi bal dena aavashyak he
 
 inke matanusaar bhi utak vigyaan kaa aadhaar koshikashareer athwa koshikavigyaan hi he
 From the above description it appears that cytology and histology should be studied together
 chunki koshikaaye atisookshm sanrachanaayen hoti hai, at: ham utak vigyaan ko sookshmsharir kaa hi paryaay maanakar ootiki kaa adhyayan karenge
 Since tissues are made by cells, we will study the energy through cells
 utakon ke samyak adhyayan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki sookshmdarshak yantra tak unhen laane ke purv unako vishesh paddatiyon dwaara upachaar kiya jaae
 To make a microscopic study of the tissue, it is mandatory that it be ultra-thin
 jivit utak ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut samantaayein pai jaati hai
 Therefore, it is not possible to study it properly
 in kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye sarvapratham utak ko 4 se 8 micron tak vichchhedit kar liya jaataa he
 The 'microtome' device is used for this task
 jivit utak kaa itnaa sookshm viched tab tak sambhav nahin hota, jab tak vah kadaa na ho
 Hence, to harden the tissue, it is stabilized in a solution of special types of chemicals
 sthayeekaran ke uparaant is utak ko alkohalon ke vibhinn gholon, abhiranjakon tathaa anya rasayanon main upachaar karke nirjal kar liya jaataa he
 In the end, it is pre-melted and put at a special temperature
 kuch samay baad mom ke saath hi utak ke tukdon ko chaturbhujakar saanche main daal diya jaataa he
 When the wax hardens, its smaller pieces are cut
 ant main in tukdon ko microtome ke vishesh bhaag main jamaakar usamen ek ati dhardaar chaaku se vishesh motaai ke anek section kaat liye jate hai
 These sections are kept on glass strips and kept for study
 kaanch kii pattiyon ko heating plate par rakhkar unka mom galaa liya jaataa he or utak kaa section kaanch kii pattee par jam jaataa he
 Glass strips laden with these sections are sterilized in special chemicals and alcohol solutions
 phir ise dylin yaa cedar ud aayal main bhigo diya jaataa he
 Now this section is ready for micro-study
 in sectionon ke sookshm adhyayan ke liye bhanti-bhanti ke microscopon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays, this type of microscope is being used extensively for studying tissues
 is sookshm adhyayan ke liye ootikirasayan or vikiran swachitran vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jane laga he
 Under chemotherapy, the chemical composition of various parts of tissues is studied
 vikiran swachitran vidhi main jivit jatu ke vishesh utak main vishesh prakaar ke radioisotopon kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 In this way, the untreated tissues are removed from the animal body and made into sections
 in sectionon ko dark room main le jaakar photography ke vishesh rasayanon dwaara anulepit kar lete hai, yaa film ke neeche rakhkar majbootee se band dete hai
 After some time they are taken out of the dark chamber and stabilized

 The soul is a different element than the body, and after the end of this life, it goes to the other world, this principle is definitely found in the Vedic hymns, but the Vedic sages did not appear in the search for why the soul travels in the world
 apni samast simaaon ke saath sansaarik jivan vaidic rishiyon kaa prey tha
 The fear of leaving Preya and moving towards the credit arose at the time of the Upanishads, then the life of life in front of salvation was destroyed and when people instead of enjoying life started turning away from it and taking sannyas
 haan, yah bhi hua ki vaidic rishi jahaan yah puch kar shant ho jate the ki 'yah sristi kisne banaai he?' or 'koun devtaa he jisaki ham upasna karen'? vahaan upanishdon ke rishiyon ne sristi banane vaale ke sambandh main kuch siddhanton kaa nishchay kar diya or us 'sat' kaa bhi pataa paa liya jo puja or upasna kaa vastut: adhikaar he
 Vedas and new narratives of Vedic religion are Upanishads
 'vedon main yajna-dharm kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya or logon ko yah sikh di gai ki is jivan main sukhi, sampann tathaa sarvatra safal va vijayi rahane ke liye aavashyak he ki devataaon kii tushti va prasannataa ke liye yajna kiye jaaen
 Yajna is the place of origin of the world
 sabhi karmon main shreshth karm yajna he
 Heaven is attained by the results of the yajna
 ' ye hi sutara chaaron ore gunjit the
 Secondly, when the Brahmin texts gave great importance to the yajna and the arbitrariness of the priests and the priests increased immensely, then there was a reaction against this system and the spirit of protest was initiated
 log sochane lage ki 'yagyon kaa vaastavik arth kya he?' 'unke bheetar koun sa rahasy he?' 've dharm ke kis rup ke pratik hai?' 'kya ve hamen jivan ke charam lakshya tak pahunchaa denge?' is prakaar, karmkand par bahut adhik jor tathaa karmkandon ko hi jivan kii sabhi samasyaon ke hal ke rup main pratipaadit kiye jane kii pravriti ne vichaarvaan logon ko unke bare main punarvichaar karne ko prerit kiya
 The Vedic Aryans became polytheists while imagining a controlling deity in every form of nature
 unke devataaon main ullekhneey hai- indra, varun, agni, savita, som, ashvinikumar, marut, pushan, mitra, pitar, yama aadi
 Then an intellectual anxiety began to see that one superpower or to understand its true nature, which is the creator of the entire creation and the authority over these gods
 is vyagrata ne upanishad ke chintanon kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The Upanishads are philosophical poetic compositions of contemplative and imaginative mystics
 jahaan gadhy likh gaye hai ve bhi padyamay gadhy-rachanaaon main aisi shabd-shakti, dhvanyaatmakataa, lav evam arthgarbhita he ki ve kisi daivi shakti kii rachanaaon kaa abhas dete hai
 It is not really an exaggeration that he was called 'mantra' or 'richa'
 vastav main mantra yaa richa kaa sambandh veda se he parantu upanishdon kii hamatta darshane ke liye in sangyaaon kaa upyog yahan bhi katipay vidwaanon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The Upanishads are an attempt to peek behind the visible world around them
 iske liye na koi upkaran uplabdh hai or na kisi prakaar kii prayog-anusandhan suvidhaayen sambhav he
 Spiritual pulsation or divine light based on your mindset, mental experience or insight is the basis of the description
 upanishad aadhyaatmavidya ke vividh adhyay hai jo vibhinn ant:prerit rishiyon dwaara likhe gaye hai
 These include various metaphors and symbols describing the nature of the world, its location, its relationship with various natural powers, the glimpse of a ray in the human soul or the presence of a subtle reflection, etc
 sristi ke udgam evam uski rachana ke sambandh main gahan chintan tathaa swayanfoort kalpana se upje roopankan ko vividh bimbon or pratikon ke madhyam se prastut karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 In the end it was said that this is what we can understand based on our best hypothesis
 iske aage is rahasy ko shaayad paramatma hi jaanata ho or 'shaayad vah bhi nahin jaanata ho
 ' sankshep main, vedon main is sansar main drishyman evam prakat prakritik shaktiyon ke swaroop ko samajhane, unhen apni kalpanaanusaar vibhinn devataaon kaa jama pahanaakar unki aradhana karne, unhen tusht karne tathaa unase sansaarik safalataa va sampannataa evam suraksha paane ke praytn kiye gaye the
 Yagyas were created to convey their reverence to them
 upanishdon main un anek prayatnon kaa vivaran he jo in prakritik shaktiyon ke peeche kii paramashkti yaa sristi kii sarvocch satta se saakshaatkaar karne kii manokamana ke saath kiye gaye
 He tried his best to reach as far as human imagination, thinking ability, insight ability could reach the philosophers, mystics or sages of that time
 yahi unka tap tha
 The Veda has four parts - Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 upanishad main aatm or anatm tattvon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he jo veda ke moulik rahasyon kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Often, the Upanishads come at the end of the Veda
 isliye ye veydant ke naam se bhi prakhyat hai
 The three major texts which authenticate the fundamental principles of Vedic religion, which are known by the name of Prasthanatrayi, are the Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Srimadbhagavadgita
 upanishad brahm vidya kaa dyotak he
 It is said that the practice of this knowledge destroys the ignorance of Mummukhujan; She makes Brahma attain; Due to which, the sorrows of human beings etc
, worldly sorrows are completely relaxed

 Maulana Abul Kalam Azad was known for his involvement in the movement before his arrest in 1916
 
 Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Mahmud Al Hasan went to Kabul in October 1915 with plans to launch a Muslim uprising in the tribal belt of British India

 islam or paigambar hazarat mohammad sahaab ne logon ko anya dharmon ke prati sammaan or sahishnutaa or is dharti par dusron ke saath milakar kaam karne ke liye sikhaaya
 The Quran clearly states that Jews and Christians are also 'people of the book', which means that Almighty God also blessed them with many prophets such as Abraham, Moses and Jesus, and all the people before the birth of Hazrat Muhammad Sahab
 The message of God told

 The principle of dependence in international politics is that resources flow from the poor and underdeveloped countries to the rich countries and make the rich countries richer by making the poor countries poorer
 nirbharta kaa siddhanth is mul manyata par aadhaarit he ki rajnatik evam aarthik karkon ke bich ek gahan sambandh hota he
 These two factors affect each other and significant changes are seen in politics depending on economic factors
 nirbharta kaa siddhanth mul rup se marxvad se prabhavit rahaa he
 Hobson and Lenin's concept of imperialism, along with Marxism, has made it stronger
 parantu chunki marxvaadi 'rajya' ke astitv ko nahin maanate isiilie ise 'nav-marxvaadi' avadharana maananaa zyada tarksangat hoga
 Although this concept has existed in international politics since the 1950s, but has become more important since the 1970s
 is kaal ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu raajnneetik-aarthik tatwon main sambandh par adhik bal diya jane laga he
 The main proponents of this theory are Paul Baran, Paul Sweezy, Harry Madgaff, Andrei Gundar Frank, Agahiri Emmanuel, Sameer Amin, Emmanuel Wallersten etc
 1970 ke dashak ke baad yah siddhanth bahut mahatvapurn ban gaya
 Discussion of this principle was given more emphasis due to the following reasons- is siddhanth ko paribhaashit karnaa ati kathin he, kyonki alag-alag lekhakon ne vibhinn prakaar se isaki vyakhya prastut karne kii koshish kii he
 Mainly various scholars believe that - is siddhanth ko vishleshan kii suvidha hetu do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he- Many scholars have seen this principle as an economic and political interaction between the 'center' and 'periphery' nations
 mul rup main unki soch main vishesh antar nahin dikhaai padataa, parantu kisi kaarak vishesh ko adhik va kam mahatv kii drushti se unhen teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he jiskaa vivaran is prakaar se he - The author of this class can be named Raoul Prabisich, who was the chairman of the South American Economic Commission of the United Nations
 iske saath-saath phurtado va shankal ko bhi isi varg main shaamil mana ja saktaa he
 Scholars advocating this idea consider the international system to be divided into states of center and periphery
 unke anusaar utpaadan ke paramparaagat tareekon se kendra ke rashtron ke paas atyaadhik smapda ikatthi ho gai he
 That is why those scholars believe that development and non-development or underdevelopment cannot be separated, rather these are two sides of the same coin
 iske atirikt, na hi aaj aantarik va bahya karkon ke bich antar rakhaa ja saktaa he, balki donon ek duusare se jude hue hai
 That is why only after the basic industrial development of Latin American countries can they be liberated from colonial and imperialist bonds
 parantu is varg ke vichaarkon kii udaaravaadi evam pragatisheel donon hi ne aalochana kii he
 Liberals say that they do not study the impact of the business cycle on the economic development process
 jabaki pragatisheel vidwaanon kaa aarope yah he ki sanrachanaatmak skool se jude log shoshan ke bare main uchit va sahi adhyayan karne main asaksham rahe hai
 In addition, these scholars also ignore the fact that development in the periphery countries is nothing but the globalization of technologies by the center nations
 is mat se jude logon main pramukh hai andrigunder frank, paal baraan, samin amin aadi
 These scholars consider the world system divided into 'metros' and 'satellites'
 phank kaa maananaa he ki poonjeevaad ke madhyam se hameshaa ‘upgrahon’ vaale rajyon main 'gaiyr-vikaas kaa vikaas' hota he
 Metropolitan nations make them more underdeveloped by the dividends of their additional capital
 upgrahon vaale rajyon main 'aviksitata kaa vikaas' ek sampoorn aitihaasik prakriya kaa hi hissaa he, apane aap main koi swatantra gatividhi nahin he
 That is why whenever these satellite nations have a weak bond with the metropolitan nations, they have increased their growth rate and the process has been opposite when they have been more connected to them
 isiilie kisi raashtra main pichhadepan kaa vikaas poonjivadi vyavastha main us rajya ke padsopan ke aadhaar par adhyayan kii ja sakati he
 In addition, it can also be evaluated on the basis of the economic structures established in that society
 is mat kii bhi do aadhaaron par aalochanaayen kii gai hai - pratham, puunji kii uplabdhta va poonjeevaad do alag-alag bindu hai so unhen ek nahin maananaa chahie
 Second, it cannot be established solely on the basis of the theory that how development has led to backwardness in Latin American countries
 teesraa varg un vichaarkon kaa he jo nirbharta va vikaas ke sambandhon ko judaa maanate hai
 Prominent thinkers among them are Cardoso, Faleto and Oswaldo Shankel
 inkaa maananaa he ki aitihaasik-sanrachanaatmak drushti se dakshini america deshon main puunji nivesh ke sandarbh main moolbhoot parivartan aaye hai
 They believe that capital investment has been invested in ready-made goods rather than agricultural or raw material products, and its associated joint ventures have been supported by local and external investors
 isiilie nirbharta, poonjeevaad varchasv va vikaas virodhabhspurn na hokar teesri duniya ke deshon main ek sangrahit varchasv sthapit karne kii sthiti rahi he
 That is why the need for urban population of third world countries has been met by external multinational companies by increasing the product of consumer goods
 isiilie in samaajon kii sanrachanaatmak vyavastha main bikharaav paidaa kar diya gaya he
 That is why these multinational companies have created a state of dependency-related development in third world countries
 yadhyapi is varg ke vichaarkon ne ek purv nirdhaarit vyakhya se alag hatakar nai vyakhya di he, parantu isse varg ke siddhanth ko ek mul ikai ke rup main uchit prayog nahin kiya ja sakaa
 There are some differences in views in the above three sections and it is different from traditional Marxism in many respects
 parantu yah satya he ki in sabhi ke anusaar aarthik vikaas kii drushti se ‘paridhi’ vaale raashtra aaj bhi mahanagareey kendron par nirbhar hai
 For this reason perhaps 'development of development' is happening in metros and 'development of development' in the periphery nations
 nirbharta siddhanth ke hi anya rup ko vishwa-pranali siddhanth ke antargat bhi adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Although some thinkers consider these two to be different, there is no difference in the basic beliefs of both
 antar keval vyakhya ko lekar he
 Therefore, it is more appropriate to accept it as a form of dependency
 vishwa pranali siddhanth ke pramukh praneta emenual walrusten ko kaha ja saktaa he jinhone apni pustak da modern world system main iskaa vistrut ullekh kiya he
 Wallerstein believes that two types of world systems are found in history - 'world empire' and 'world economy'
 donon main mukhya antar yah he ki sansadhano ke bantwaare ke bare main kis prakaar se nirnay liye jate hai
 They believe that in the 'world empire' system, power is used to divide resources from 'periphery states' to 'center states'
 iske vipareet vishwa arthvyavastha pranali main ek kendriyakrut raajnneetik dhaanche kaa abhaav hota he
 Therefore, instead of distributing resources by law, it is done through the market
 is prakaar yaddhapi sansadhano ke bantwaare ke sambandh main donon ke tareeke bhinn hai parantu donon kaa hi kul parinaam ek samaan he
 That is, the transfer of resources from the periphery nations to the central states
 walrusten ke anusaar 'kendra rashtron' kii visheshta he - prajatantric sarkarein, ucch vetan, kachche maal kaa aayaat, taiyarshuda maal kaa niryaat, ucch puunji nivesh, kalyankari sevaayen aadi
 On the contrary, 'periphery nations' have characteristics - non-democratic government system, export of raw materials, import of finished goods, low level pay, lack of welfare services
 parantu walrusten nirbharatavaadiyon se thodaa bhinn hai
 Apart from the center and periphery, they also consider a third class of nations as 'equal periphery'
