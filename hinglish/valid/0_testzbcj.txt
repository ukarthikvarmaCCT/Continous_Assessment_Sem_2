 The nebula or nebula is an interstellar cloud located in interstellar medium that contains dust, hydrogen gas, helium gas, and other ionized plasma gases
 puraane jamaane main "niharika" khagol main dikhne vaali kisi bhi vistrut vastu ko kehete the
 Any galaxy beyond the galaxy was called a nebula
 baad main jab edwin habal ke anusandhan se yah gyaat hua ki yah gallexiyaan hai, to naam badal die gaye
 For example, the Andromeda Galaxy was previously known as the Andromeda Nabula
 niharikaon main aksar taare or grahiy mandal janm lete hai, jaise ki chil niharika main dekha gaya he
 This nebula is depicted in a very famous picture called "pillars of Creation" drawn by NASA
 in kshetron main gas, dhul or anya saamagree kii sanrachanaayen paraspar "ek saath judakar" bade dheron kii rachana karti hai, jo anya padaarthon ko aakarshith karata he evam kramshah sitaron kaa gathan karne yogya paryaapt bada aakaar le letaa hai
 The remaining material is believed to constitute the planets and other objects of the planetary system
 "niharika" ko angrezi main "nebula" likhaa jaataa he
 It is a Latin language word and used to mean "cloud", the plural meaning "nebulai", "nebulay" or "nebulis"
 is baat ke pramaan uplabdh hai ki doorabeen ke avishkaar ke pehle se maaya logon ko niharikaon ke bare main pataa tha
 a folklore pertaining to the area of the sky surrounding the deer constellation supports this theory
 kahani main ullekh he ki dadhakati aag ke aasapaas ek dhabba he
 Around 150 CE, Claudius Ptolemy mentions five stars appearing in nebulae in issue VII-VIII of his book Almagest
 unhone saptarshi taramandal main ek badalon se yukt yaa dhundhale kshetra kaa bhi ullekh kiya tha, jo kisi bhi taare ke saath nahin judaa tha
 Unlike the galaxies, the first real nebula was mentioned by the Persian astronomer Abd al-rahman al-sufi in his "situated Star Book"
 unhone andromeeda gallexi ke sthaan par "ek chota badal" dekha tha
 He characterized the Omricran Velorum constellation Punj as a "nebulous star" or obscure star and other obscure objects in Bruchi's cluster
 1054 main arab or chini khagolavidon dwaara craib nebyal SN 1054 kii rachana karne vaale supernova ko dekha gaya tha
 al-sufi failed to recognize the Orion nebiyal due to unknown reasons, which appears at least as clear as the Andromeda sky Ganges in the night sky
 26 navambar 1610 ko nicholas-claude fabi de piresk ne ek doorabeen kaa upyog kar orion nebyal kaa avishkaar kiya
 In 1618 John the Baptist Cyst also studied this nebula
 haalanki, 1659 tak arthath isai higence jo apane ko niharikaon yaa is khagoleey dhundhalake kaa avishkaar karne vaale pehla vyakti maanate the, se pehle orion nebyal par koi vistrut adhyayan nahin hua
 In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae
 Throughout the century, the number continued to increase, with the compilation of a list of 20 released in 1746 by Jean Philippe de Chasaux
 Nicolas Louis de Lacale listed 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope in 1751–53
 Most of which were previously unknown
 iske baad charles mesier ne 1781 tak 103 niharikaon kii suchi banaai, haalanki unke aisa karne kii pramukh vajah thi - dhoomaketuon kii galat pahchaan se bachanaa
 Subsequently, the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel increased the number of nebulae
 unki kaitalong of van thaujend new nebylai and cluster of stars 1786 main prakashit hui
 ek hajaar kii duusari suchi 1789 main or 510 kii teesri tathaa antim suchi 1802 main prakashit kii gayi thi
 Throughout much of his work, William Herschel was convinced that these nebulae were mere underdeveloped stars
 haalanki, 1790 main, unhone aspashtataa se ghire ek taare kii khoj kii or yah nishkarsh nikaala ki yah adhik duuri par sthit samooh na hokar ek vaastavik ghatatope yaa niharika thi
 In early 1864, William Huggins investigated the spectra or range of about 70 nebulae
 They found that about a third of them had a wide range of gas inclusions
 baaki main ek satat vistrut shrenee dikhaai di or inhen sitaron kaa ek samooh mana gaya
 In 1912, a third category was added when Vesto Slifer demonstrated that the nebulae around the Meropee star resembled the Pleiades open starfish
 is prakaar niharika taron ke prativimvit prakaash dwaara chamakta he
 Slifer and Edwin Hubble continued to collect a wide range of these from several diffused nebulae and discovered that 29 of these showed emission spectra and 33 had continuous spectra of starlight
 1922 main habal ne ghoshnaa kii ki lagbhag sabhi niharikaayen sitaron se judy hai or unki roshni taron ke prakaash se aati he
 They also discovered that nebulae in the emission spectrum are almost always warmer than B1 or more, whereas nebulae with continuous spectra appear with relatively cold stars
 habal or henry noris rasel donon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki garm taron ke aasapaas kii niharikaayen kisi na kisi prakaar se parivartit ho rahi hai
 Many nebulae are formed due to the mutual gravity of the gas in the interstellar medium
 apane nijee bhaar ke tahat dravya ke sankuchit hone kii vajah se centre main anek vishaal sitaron kaa gathan ho saktaa he or unka parabangnee prakaash aasapaas kii gaison ko ynit kar prakaash tarangon par unhen drushtigochar banaata he
 Rosette Nebiel and Pelicon Nebiel are examples of such nebulae
 HII kshetra ke naam se parichit is prakaar kii niharikaon kaa aakaar, gas ke vaastavik badalon ke aakaar par nirbhar hota he
 This is where stars are formed
 isse gathit sitaron ko kabhi-kabhi ek yuva, deele cluster ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Some nebulae are formed as a result of explosions in supernovae, ie the end of large and short-gv stars
 supernova ke visphot se bikharanevaali saamagree urja dwaara ynit hoti he or isse nirmit ho sakanevaali thos vastu kaa gathan hota he
 The Crab Nebula of Taurus constellation is the best example of this
 varsh 1054 main supernova kii ghatana darj kii gayi or ise or SN1054 ke rup main chihnit kiya gaya
 The solid object formed after the explosion is located in the center of the Crab Nebule and is a neutron star
 anya niharikaayen grahiy niharikaon kaa gathan kar sakati hai
 Like the Earth's sun, it is the last phase of the life of a low-mass mass star
 8-10 saura dravyaman vaale taare laal daanav taron ke rup main viksit hote hai or apane vaataavaran main spandan ke dauraan dhire-dhire apni baheri parat kho dete hai
 When a star loses enough material, its temperature rises and the ultraviolet radiation emitted from it can ionize the nebula thrown around it
 niharika main avshisht saamagree sahit 97% hydrogen or 3% helium he
 The main goal of this phase is to achieve balance
 niharikaon ko chaar pramukh samoohon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Earlier galaxies and round galaxies were considered to be different types of practicals
 gallexion kii sarpakar sanrachana kii vyakhya ke liye sarpakar niharika kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 This classification does not include all known structures like clouds
 jiskaa ek udahaaran herbig-haaro object he
 Diffuse nebulae near the stars are examples of reflection nebulae
 adhikansh niharikaon ko visarit niharikaayen kaha ja saktaa he, jiskaa arth he ki ve vistrut hai evam kisi sarvamaanya paribhaasha kii seemaa main nahin aatin
 In visible light, these nebulae can be divided into emission nebulae and reflection nebulae, based on how the visible light is composed to us
 utsarjan niharika main ayanit gas hota he, jo utsarjan kii dhundhlee rekha banaati hai
 These emission nebulae are often called HII fields, with the term "HII" often used for ionized hydrogen in commercial astronomy
 utsarjan niharikaon kii tulana main, pratibimb niharikaayen swayan paryaapt maatra main dikhaai dene yogya prakaash rekha nahin banaatin balki apane aasapaas ke sitaron ke prakaash ko pratibimbit karti hai
 Dark or dark nebulae are the same as diffuse nebulae, but they cannot be seen by the light emitted or reflected by them
 Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of distant stars or emission nebulae
 haalanki ye niharikaayen prakaash tarangon par alag-alag dikhaai detii hai, par ve sabhi infrared yaa avarakt taragon par utsarjan ke ujjwal strot hai
 This emission mainly comes from the dust inside the nebulae
 grahiy niharikaayen, ve niharikaayen hai, jo lo-moss ananthasparshi vishaal shakha sitaron ke safed boune main parivartit hone ke samay unase nikalanevaale gas yukt khol se gathit hoti hai
 These nebulae are emitting nebulae with blurred emission, similar to those of emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 takneekee taur par, yah HII kshetra hai kyonki adhiktar hydrogen ynit hoga
 However, planetary nebulae are more dense and more solid than emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 grahon kii niharikaon ko yah naam isliye diya gaya he kyonki jin pehle khagolavidon ne in vastuon kaa adhyayan kiya tha unhone sochaa ki niharikaayen grahon kii tastariyon yaa discon jaisi dikhti hai, haalanki, ve grahon se sanvandhit nahin hai
 a proto planetary nebula is an astronomical object, a short-lived episode of the rapid stellar gradual evolution of a star between the position of the former asymptomatic giant branch and the phase of the post-planetary nebula
 ek PPN shashakt avarakt vikiran utsarjit karata he or ek pratibimb niharika he
 The actual point of formation of a PPN planetary nebula is defined by the temperature of the central star
 jab ek hai-moss sitara apane jivan ke ant tak pahunch jaataa he tab supernova ghatit hota he
 When nuclear fusion stops at the star's core or center, the star disintegrates
 andar risnevaali gas yaa to pratikshipt hoti he athwa itani adhik garm ho jaati he ki yah kendra se baahar kii ore failati he tathaa taare ke visphot kaa kaaran banati he
 The expanding shell of the gas forms a special type of diffused nebula supernova remnant
 haalanki, supernova avshesh kaa adhikansh prakaash evam eks-re utsarjan ynit gas se utpann hota he, radioutsarjan kaa bada bhaag synchroton utsarjan ke naam se parichit non-thermal utsarjan he
 This emission arises from high-velocity electrons oscillating in magnetic fields

 Billy was the prince of the princely state of Kapurthala
 inkaa billy naam inaki buaa rajkumaari amrit cor ne rakhaa tha jo mahatma gandhi kii sachiv va nehru sarkaar main pratham mahila swasthya mantri rahi, aap kii shiksha-diksha british-raaj main hui, balrampur riyasat main inke pita ko bartania hukumat ne court-aaf-ward niyukt kiya tha, so inkaa bachapan balrampur kii riyasat main gujara
 The stories of their hunting in the forests of Balrampur were famous and at the age of 12, they hunted tigers
 raaj-parivaar va ek bade afasar ke putr hone ke kaaran aap ne oonche darje kaa ilm hasil kiya or british-bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gayi, dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke baad inhone khiri ke jangalon ko apana baseraa bananaa sunshchit kar liya
 In the past, all the properties of his princely state were in Kheri and Bahraich, which were given by the British as rewards to their ancestors
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke uparant billy ne khiri ke jangalon ko apana ghar bana liya or yaheen rah kar pachaas varshon tak vanya jeev sarankshan main apana athulaneey yogadan diya, jo aaj puri duniya main ek misaal he

 Billy Arjan Singh died on 1 January 2010 at Jasvir Nagar farm near Palia in Lakhimpur Kheri
 is vakt billy kii umr 93 varsh thi
 Billy's jeep passed in front of a jeep in 1960 and his beauty in the jeep light in the dark night charmed Billy, it was the beauty of nature that Arjan Singh felt !! At the same time, he gave up hunting
 khiri main jangalon ke madhya rahane kaa va kheti karne kaa nishchay dudhwa neshnal park ke astitv main aane kaa pehla kadam tha
 The establishment of the Jasvir Nagar farm in the name of his father in 1946 and then of Tiger Howen in 1968, was the first sign of destiny that now these forests of Kheri would be able to survive, or else the British were transferred to independent India
 The vast forests of the country were going wildly, obviously we had taken independence, but our dependence was only on natural resources and perhaps even today! It was due to Indira ji that the rehabilitation of tigers and tendu became possible in Tiger Haven
 yah vah daur tha jab desh-videsh ke film-nirmaataaon main hode machi thi ki koun billy ke in anuthe prayogon par apni behtareen dacumentary bana le
 There was no talk of any sanctuary in India as much as Billy's private forest, which is known to Tiger Howen all over the world
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad is anterrashtriya shakhsiyat billy arjan singh ne british-bhartiya sena kaa daaman chhod khiri ke vishaal jangalon ko apana mustakabil bana liya or use ek khubasurat anjaam bhi diya, jise aaj ham dudhwa neshnal park ke naam se jaanate hai
 In the early days, he built a farm house in the name of his father Jasvir Singh on the road from Palia to Sampurnanagar and made farming his way
 kabhi shikari rah chuke billy jab ek din apni hathini par savaar ho jangal main daakhil hue to suheli or nevara nadiyon ke madhya bhaag ko dekhakar stabdh rah gayi, athulaneey prakritik soundarya se aachhadit thi ye dharti jiske chaaro taraf shakhu ke vistaarit van
 It was this watch that determined the presence of Tiger Haven
 san 1969 i0 main yah jangal billy ne kharid liya, jiske dakshin-uttar main saritaayen or pashchim-purv main ghaney van
 And here established tiger haven for tigers and tendu
 arjan singh ke nirantar prayaason se san 1977 main dudhwa neshnal park bana or fir tiger project kii shuruwat hui or is project ke tahat san 1988 main dudhwa neshnal park or kishanpur vanya jeev vihaar milakar dudhwa taigar rigerv kii sthapana kar di gayi
 Billy's contribution to preserving the reindeer in the Sathiana Range forests adjacent to Tiger Haven is memorable
 arjan singh hameshaa kehete rahe kii faresti department se wild-life ko alag kar alag vibhaag banaaya jaay, wild-life department! kyonki us jamaane main faresti department jangal bachaane ke bajaae kataane ke prayaas main adhik tha, sarkare jangalon kaa timber maffiaon ke dwaara inkaa vyavsaayee karan kar rahi thi
 If this separate department is made, then the people who join it will come after acquiring wildlife expertise
 jangalon kii tuutati shrankhlaayein billy ke liye chintaa kaa vishay rahi, kyonki baaghon kaa dayera bahut bada hota he or yadi jangal sikudte gayi to baagh bhi kam hote jaayenge! kabhi aadmi ke na rahane yogya is ilaake main "da colective farms and faresti limited ne 10,000 hectare junglee bhoomi kaa safaaya kar diya or log pakistan se aa aa kar basane lage, baad main bhudaan aandonlan main basaayen gayi logon ne ghaas ke maidaanon ko ganne ke kheton main tabdeel kar diya
 And the Dudhwa forest was transformed into a forest island
 jo billy ko sadaiv pareshaan karata rahaa
 After independence, the way people moved into this wild area and kept converting forest land into agricultural land, the reason is now erasing the existence of tigers and other creatures
 baaghon ke liye adhik sangrakshit kshetron kii unki khwis ke kaaran hi kishanpur vanya-jeev vihaar kaa vajood main aana hua jo ab dudhwa tiger rigerv kaa ek hissaa he
 Impressed by Jim Corbett and the FW Champion, Billy Arjan Singh wrote eight books which are the best accounts of this series of North India
 baagh va tenduon ke shavakon ko trend kar unhe unke prakritik awaas yani jangal main safalata purvak punervasit karne kaa jo kaary billy arjan singh ne kiya vah adwitiya he puure sansar main
 Prince, Harriet and Juliet were three of their tenders who were fully rehabilitated in the forest, later the tigress Tara, brought from the Zoo of England, also succeeded in making Dudhwa's forests their home
 iskaa natiza hai tara kii pidhia jo dudhwa ke wanon main fal-phul rahi hai
 Billy tried to discredit Tara as being a combination of Siberian or other breeds, and named it "genetic pollution", while genetic science suggests that geographic boundaries and interconnected species living in different environmental areas are not harmful
 Is rather better
 yadi aisa hota to koi angrej kisi asin desh main vaivaahik sambadh nahin sthapit karata or na hi asin kisi america yaa africa se
 In Indian tradition also, the matrimonial relationship is invalid and in science terms also, how the Siberian, Russian-born tigress has genetic pollution related to tigers of India
 in-bridigan ke khataron se bachane ke liye bhinn-bhinn samudaayon ke jeevon ke madhya sambadh sthapit karaate hai taaki unki jin-vividhita barkaar rahe or billy ne is prakaar dudhwa ke baaghon main yah vividhita kaayam kii
 In Dudhwa, Tara's hustle is growing steadily, the presence of an indo-siberian breed in the tigers of Dudhwa has also been considered as a scientific institution, but arrangements are being feared to be officially accepted
 yah sabit ho chukaa he, ki dudhwa ke jangal main baagh siberian-royal bengal tiger kii jin-vividhita ke saath is nasl ko or majboot bana rahe hai
 Due to this genetic diversity, the breed of Indian tigers will be better now
 nahin to sikud chuke jangalon main ye baagh aapas main hi sambadh kaayam karte

 Bapu had to leave for Africa shortly after returning from England
 jab 1896 main ve bharat aae tab ba ko apane saath le gaye
 Since then, she has been following the footsteps of Bapu
 unhone unki tarah hi apane jivan ko sada bana liya tha
 She was always with him in Bapu's religious and civil services
 yahi unke saare jivan kaa saar he
 In many of Bapu's fasts, Baa was often with him and kept his essence
 jab 1932 main harijanon ke prashn ko lekar baapu ne yarvada jail main aamaran upwas aarambh kiya us samay ba sabarmati jail main thim
 At that time she became very restless and got rested only when she was sent to Yerwada Jail

 Bapu tried hard to get this law canceled
 par jab ve safal na hue tab unhone satyagrah karne kaa nishchay kiya or usamen sammilit hone ke liye striyon kaa bhi aahvaan kiya
 But he discussed this matter with other women but did not discuss it with Ba
 ve nahin chaahate the ki ba unke kehane se satyagraiyon main jaayan or phir baad main kathinaaiyon main padakar visham paristhiti upasthit karen
 They wanted them to go free and go if they persevered
 jab ba ne dekha ki baapu ne unase satyagrah main bhaag lene kii koi charchaa nahin kii to badi du:khee hui or baapu ko upalambh diya
 Swetchaya then joined the Satyagraha and jailed along with three other women
 jail main jo bhojan mila vah akhaadya tha at: unhone falahar karne kaa nishchay kiya
 But when his request was not heeded, he started fasting
 nidaan paanchaven din adhikariyon ko jhukna padaa
 But the fruits given were not enough for the whole meal
 at: ba ko teen maheene jail main aadhe pet bhojan par rahanaa padaa
 When she got out of jail, her body was left stagnant

 In 1939, Thakur Saheb of Rajkot agreed to give certain rights to the subjects, but later retracted
 janata ne iske viruddh apana virodh prakat karne ke liye satyagrah karne kaa nishchay kiya
 When Ba heard this, he felt that Rajkot was his own house
 vahaan hone vaale satyagrah main bhaag lenaa unka kartavya he
 He obtained Bapu's permission for this and as soon as he reached Rajkot, he was put under house arrest in a case of civil disobedience
 pehle unhen ek ekant sunsaan main based gaanv main rakhaa gaya jahaan kaa vaataavaran unke tanik bhi anukool na tha
 The public agitated that their health is not good, it is inhuman to keep them away from medical facilities
 falat: ve rajkot se 10-15 mile dur ek rajmahal main rakhi gayin
 Shortly after Ba's departure, Bapu also decided to participate in Satyagraha and started fasting there
 jab ba ko isaki khabar mili to unhone ek samay hi bhojan karne kaa nishchay kiya
 She always used to do this during Bapu's fast
 do teen din baad hi rajkot sarkaar ne yah bhulaava dekar ki ve baapu se milanaa chahen to ja sakati hai, unhen baapu ke paas bhej diya
 But when no one came to take them back to the place of detention in the evening, it was found that they had been released from this deception
 baapu ko yah sahya na tha
 He sent Ba back to jail at one o'clock in the night
 rajkot sarkaar kii himmat na hui ki vah sari raat unhen sadak par rahane de
 She was taken back to the palace and thereafter she was released the next day

 GPRS, GSM circuit switchd data kshamtaaon kaa vistaar karata he or nimnlikhit sevaaon ko sambhav banaata he: If SMS is used over GPRS, an SMS transmission speed of 30 SMS per minute can be achieved
 yah GSM par saadhaaran SMS kaa upyog karne se adhik tej he, jisaki prasaaran gati 6 se 10 SMS prati minute he
 GPRS supports the following protocols: jab TCP / IP kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, to prayek phone ko ek yaa ek se adhik IP pataa abantit kar sakate hai
 GPRS, during cell transfer, will store IP packets and forward them to the phone
 TCP handles any packet loss resulting in a temporary flow-stop in transmission speed
 GPRS kaa samarthan karne vaale upkarnon ko teen virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he: To broadcast at two different frequencies at the same time, a true class a device may be required and thus two radios will be required
 is mahangi aavashyaktaa se bachane ke liye, ek GPRS mobile dohari antaran vidha ko lagu kar saktaa he

 In addition to GPRS, two other GSM technologies exist that provide data services: circuit-switched data and high-speed circuit-switched data
 Unlike the shared nature of GPRS, these rather establish a dedicated circuit
 Some applications, such as video phones, may prefer HSCSD, especially when there is a continuous flow of data between the ends
 nimnlikhit talika, GPRS or circuit switchd data sevaaon ke kuch sambhav vinyas ko prastut karti he
 The multiple access method used in GPS with GPRS is based on frequency division duplex and TDMA

 basal gangliya rishadhari jeevon ke mastishk main sthit vibhinn mul ke nabhikon kaa ek samooh he jo ek sanyukt kaaryaatmak ikai ke rup main kaary sampadan karte hai
 They are located in the base region of the anterior part of the brain and are strongly connected to the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and other areas of the brain

 Currently popular theories consider the basal ganglia primarily responsible for action selection, that is, deciding which of the various possible behaviors to take place at a time
 prayogtmak adhyayan darshaate hai ki basal gangliya kai gatisheel tantron par nirodhatmak prabhaav daalate hai or is nirodhi prabhaav ke hatate hi gatisheel tantra sakriy ho jaataa he
 The "change of behavior" in the basal ganglia is influenced by signals transmitted from several parts of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex that plays an important role in executive function
 basal gangliya ke mukhya ghatak hai- striatum jise neostriatum bhi kehete hai or jo codet evam putamin se bana hota he, globas palids yaa palidam jo globas palids eksterna yaa globas palids interna se bana hota he, substanshia nigra jo substanshia nigra pars compecta evam substanshia nigra pars reticulata se milakar bana hota he or sabathalemic nabhik 
 striatum, jo sabase bada ghatak he, kai mastishk kshetron se input praapt karata he lekin keval basal gangliya ke anya ghatakon ko hi output bhejtaa he
 The pallidum receives the most important input from the striatum and sends several regions related to inhibitory output dynamics, including the portion of the thalamus that elevates the dynamics-related regions of the cortex
 reticulata jo substenshia nigra kaa ek bhaag he, vah palidam kii hi tarah kaary karata he, evam compecta naamak doosraa hissaa striatum ko neuro transmeter dopamin strot kaa input pradaan karata he
 The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cortex and transports part of the pallidum

 The basal ganglia play a central role in various neural states, including many mobility disorders
 sabase ullekhneey hai, parkingsanse rog, jisame substenshia nigra par compecta main melanin pigmented dopamin utpaadak koshikaon kaa patan hota he or hantingtons vikaar jisame multah striatum kshatigrast hoti hai
 Some behavioral control disorders also include dysfunctional states of the basal ganglia, such as, in Torret's syndrome, belismus, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Wilson's disease
 The neuro pathology mechanisms related to Parkinson's disorder and Huntington's disorder apart from Wilson's disease and Hemi bellismus disorder have not been properly understood or are still in the developing theoretical state
 basal gangliya main ek haath-pairon ki tarah dikhaai dene vaala kshetra hota he jiske avyavon ko alag - alag naam die gaye hai- nabhik ekambence, ventral palidam or ventral tegmental kshetra 
 afferents nabhik ekambence ko usee tarah dopamin pradaan karte hai jis tarah substanshia nigra dorcel striatum ko dopamin pradaan karti he
 Since there is a lot of evidence indicating that it has a central role in rare studies, the dopaminergic projection of VTA → NA has attracted a large number of attention

 The said primary cavities are formed during the normal development of the neural tube in the human embryo and initially consist of a rostral to caudal orientation - the procensipheles, mesencephals, and robensipheles
 Later, during the development of the nervous system, each section is converted into smaller components
 nimna talika is vikasaatmak vargeekaran ko darshaati he or basal gangliya main pai jane vaali sharir sanrachana tak anugaman karti he
 : basal gangliya tellencifelone kaa ek buniyadi avyav he
 In contrast, the layer of cortics lining the surface of the forebrain, while the basal ganglia, a distinctly visible group of gray matter, is located near the confluence of the thalamus at the depth of the brain
 mastishk ke adhikansh bhaagon kii tarah, basal gangliya main bhi baayein or daayen paksh hote hai jo ki ek duusare ki abhaasi chhaviyon ke rup main hote he
 From the anatomical point of view, anatomists have divided the basal ganglia into four distinct structures and this division depends on how well the said structures are rostral: two of them ie the striatum and the pallidum are relatively large, the other Two, ie the substencia nigra and subthalamic nucleus are small structures in shape
 dayee ore ke udhaaharan main, maanav mastishk ke do kapaal anubhag maanchitr main basal gangliya ke avyavon kii sthiti darshaayi jaati he
 As a note, it is clarified that, as seen in the above map, the subthalamic nucleus and the substencia are located very posterior to the nigra brain
 striatum basal gangliya kaa sabase bada avyav he
 Stripes are seen when the structure of the striatum is cut in certain directions, many of which appear to be the origin of small and large nerve fibers, hence the term "striatum" is used
 purv ke sharir sanrachana vaigyanikon ne maanav mastishk kaa pareekshan kar samajha tha ki striatum do bhinn-bhinn padaarthon se bana he jinhen aantarik capsule naamak shwet padaarth ke vistaar se pruthak kiya gaya he
 He named these two substances as cadet and putamen
 Modern anatomy scientists concluded by microscopic and neurochemical studies that it is reasonable to consider these substances as two separate parts of the same structure i
e
 the striatum, just as a river separates a city into two

 The striatum's internal organization is exceptionally complex
 isamen bahutansh neurons "madhyam kantedaar neurons", kism ke hai
 They are gabaergic cells whose cell bodies are small and dendrites are covered with dense dendritic thorns that receive synaptic input from the cortex and thalamus
 neuro rasayan evam jodne ke tareeke ke aadhaar par madhyam kantedaar neurons ko kai tareekon se upaprakaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa hai
 The next most multi-numbered type, with large, smooth dendrites, are cholinergic intraurons
 anya or bhi kai prakaar ke aantarik neurons hai, jo neural aabaadi ke chote bhaag hai
 Several studies have shown that there have usually been topographic relationships between the cortex and the striatum, that is, each part of the cortex sends strong input to some part of the striatum, followed by others
 sthalakriti kii prakruti ko samajhnaa mushkil he, lekin, shaayad kuch hisse main kyonki striatum kaa sanghathan teen ayaamon main yojit kiya gaya he jabaki cortex, ek starit sanrachana ke rup main, do main yojit he
 This dimensional discrepancy leads to large amounts of deformation and separation when mapping one structure to another
 dilachasp he ki, vahi sthalakriti sambandh thilemus striatal ke liye lagu hote he
 Pallidum is a large structure called globus pallidus that is located with a small abdominal planar expansion, called the ventral pallidum
 globas palids ekal tantrika padaarth ke rup main prathit hota he, lekin kaaryaatmak bhinnata ke chalate do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, un hisson ko aantarik bahya khand kaha jaataa he, evam sankshipt main jipiai or jipei bhi kehete hai
 Both segments originally contain gabaergic neurons, which show inhibitory effects on their targets
 ukt do khand alag-alag tantrika paripathon main bhaag lete hai
 The input to the outer segment or GPE is predominantly from the striatum and is projected onto the subthalamus nucleus
 aantarik khand, yaa jipiai, ko do pathon ke madhyam cestrtum dwaara sanket praapt hote hai, jinhen "pratyaksh" or "apratyaksh" path kaha jaataa he
 Pallidal neurons function using a "non-inhibitory" principle
 ukt neurons input ke abhaav main sthir ucch dar se prakshepit hote hai or striatum dwaara sanket ke chalate ve "tehraav" kii sthiti main aa jate hai
 Since the pallidal neurons themselves have inhibitory effects on their targets, the total effect of the input received to the pallidum is reflected in the controlled inhibition exhibited by the pallidal cells on the targets
 sabstantia nigra basal gangliya ke ek missenciphelic grey padaarth kaa bhaag he jo esaenar or esensi main vibhajit he
 Often the SNR works in harmony with the GPI and the SNR - GPI complex performs the anti-function of the thalamus
 sabstantia nigra pars compecta neuro transmeter dopamin kaa nirmaan karata he jo ki striatal path kaa santulan banane main kaaphi mahatvapurn hota he
 The circuit below explains the role and circuit of the components of the basal ganglia
 sabathalemic nabhik, basal gangliya kaa ek diencefelic grey padaarth he, evam yah gangliya kaa ekmaatr hissaa he jo vastav main "uttejk" glutamic amla transmeter banaata he
 The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the SNR-GPI complex and is also a part of the "indirect pathway"
 basal gangliya ke jatil paripath ko samajhane ke liye, hamen sarvapratham paripath ke mahatvapurn bhagidaaron ko jaananaa aavashyak he
 The basal ganglia are in direct contact with the thalamus and cortex
 isiilie, basal gangliya dwaara nirmit paripath main cortex, thilemus or basal gangliya, basal gangliya dwaara nirmit teen mukhya bhagidaar hote hai
 The human brain is responsible for the cortex, the highest state of power, and conscious perception of the world
 tantrika tantra dwaara pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se kiye gaye sabhi kaary cortex se sambandhit hai
 Many different areas of the cortex perform different functions
 pre-central gaeres cortex kaa aisa hi ek bhaag he jise "motor cortex" naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Specific neurons of the motor cortex region of the cortex extend their axons to the striatum portion of the basal ganglia
 ukt cortics ke neurons neurotransmeter glutamet chhodte hai, jo uttejk prakruti kaa hota he
 After being excited by glutamate, cells located in the striatum project in two different directions to form two major pathways - the "direct" and "indirect" circuits
 pratyaksh paripath main cortex dwaara ek baar uttejit hone par, striatum kii koshikaayen nirodhi neurons naamak neuro transmeter nirmit karti hai) esaenar -jipiai complex koshikaon, par prakshepit karti he
 snrs and gpis are intended to exert inhibitory effects on the thalamus while being continuously in contact with the thalamus, creating the GABA
 esaenar -jipiai ke nirodhatmak prabhaav ke chalate antim nishkarsh swarup thilemus par nirodhatmak prabhaav kaa lop hota he
 It is interesting to note that the thalamus itself projecting on the cortex continuously stimulates the cortex by glutamate
 isiilie, pratyaksh paripath ke chalate thilemus ko anumati praapt hoti he ki vah cortex ko uttejit kare
 uttejit hone ke baad cortex yah "uttejnaa" sandesh motor paripath ko parshv cortico spinal tract ke madhyam se mansapeshiyon tak pahunchaata he, jiske falswaroop ati gatij vyavhaar najar aata he
 The following diagram shows the "direct" route: cortex - -> striatum - -> "esaenar-jipiai" complex - -> thilemus - -> cortex - -> mansapeshiyon, aadi -> At the opposite end there is an indirect circuit that starts from the neurons of the striatum
 striatum main sthit neurons ke samooh cortex dwaara prerit hote hi ab nirodhi eksans globas palids eksterna ki koshikaon ko nirodhi sanket prasaarit karte hai
 gpes show persistent anticonvulsant effects to the subthalamic nucleus
 nirodhak dwaara nirodhi prabhaav ke chalate estn vastav main uttejit ho jate hai
 As a result, stns also spontaneously stimulate the complex SNR-GPI, where the main function of the SNR-GPI complex is to have an antagonistic effect on the thalamus
 iske falswaroop antat thilemus kaa vaastavik nirodh hokar thilemus dwaara cortex ko utejit karne kii kriya main kami hona, hota he
 As a result, the cortex contributes to the hypercritical position or loss of movement, by stimulating the muscles through the lateral cortico spinal tract
 sankshep main, pratyaksh or apratyaksh paripath kaary sampadan main paraspar virdohi hote hai
 Cortex - -> Striatum - -> GPE - -> STN - -> "SNR-GPI" Complex - -> Thalamus - -> Cortex - -> Muscle, etc
 -> kintu, yadi pratyaksh paripath gati kii sahaayta kare or apratyaksh paripath sahaayta na kare, to maanav sharir main janmajaat svaichhik gati ko lekar virodhabhas rahata he
 This paradox is diagnosed by the implementation of the substra nigra pars compacta that produce dopamine
 dopamine se basal gangliya main sthit vishisht di 1 receptors uttejit ho "pratyaksh" path ko madad karte hai, jabaki basal gangliya main sthit vishisht di 2 receptors par dopamine se nirodhi prabhaav utpann hota he evam vastav main "apratyaksh path" ko madad karata he
 In this way, the body creates a balanced position by keeping pace between motion and its absence

 The naming of the basal ganglia and its components has always been problematic
 purv ke sharir rachana shastri sthool darshi sharir sanrachana ko dekhakar, kintu tantrika rasayan shaastra ke koshikeey nirmaan se anjaan hone ke naate, unhone aise avyavon ko sanchit kiya jo ab mana jane laga he ki bhinn- bhinn kaaryon ko anjaam dete hai, or is tarah unhone avyavon ko vibhinn naam die jo ab samajha jaataa he ki kaaryaatmak drushti se, usee sanrachana ke hisse hai 
 The term "basal" stems from the fact that most of its elements are located in the basal part of the forebrain
 gangliya shabd mithyaa naam he: aadhunik upyog main maatr paridhiy tantrika tantra ke neural / tantrika samoohon ko hi "gangliya" se sambodhit kiya jaataa jabaki kendriya tantrika tantra ke neural / tantrika samoohon ko "nabhik" kaha jaataa he
 For this reason, the basal ganglia are sometimes also known as the "basal nucleus"
 terminologia anatomica, jo ki sharir sanrachana namakaran ke liye antarrashtriya praadhikrut sanstha he, ne "nabhik beselis" naam sujhaayaa he jo ki saamanytah upyog main nahin liya jaataa
 The International Basal Ganglia Society informally believes that the basal ganglia are made up of the striatum, pallidum, substensia nigra and subthalamic nucleus
 percheron aadi ne 1991 main or parent and parent ne 2005 main thilemus ke madhya bhaag ko basal gangliya ke ek bhaag ke rup main sammilit kiya, jabaki mena-segovia aadi ne 2004 main pedunculopontine complex ko bhi sammilit kiya
 In addition, the names given to different nuclei of the basal ganglia vary
 vishesh rup se, aadi maanav ke globas palids ke andruni khand ko mushakon main antopeduncular nabhik kaha jaataa he
 Etc
 The outer segment of "striatum" and "globus pallidus" in humans are called "palaeostriatum augmentatum" and "palaeostriatum primitivum", respectively, in birds

 The largest sources of detailed information about the basal ganglia are two neurological disorders, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease
 in donon vikaron ke liye, tantrika kii kshati ko acchhee tarah gyaat kar parinamswaroop dikhaai dene vaale lakshanon ke saath sahasambaddha kiya ja saktaa he
 In Parkinson's disease, there is a large loss of dopaminergic cells located in the ssubstantia nigra, a severe loss of medium prickly neurons located in the striatum in Huntington's disease
 donon rogon ke lakshan lagbhag vipareet hai- parkingsanse rog kii visheshta he ki usame gatividhi karne kii kshamta kaa hraas hota he, jabaki hantington rog kii visheshta he ki usame sharir ke bhaagon kii anaichhik rup se gatividhi ko rokane main asamarthta hoti he
 It is noteworthy that, although the symptoms of both diseases are particularly in their cognitively advanced stage, the most prominent symptoms are related to the onset of activity and their ability to control
 is prakaar, donon vikaar mukhya rup se gatividhi kii aswasthta main vargeekrut hai
 a different type of disease related to activity malaise, known as hemibellismus, is caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus

 One of the most studied works of basal ganglia is the role of basal ganglia in eye movements
 a wide network of brain regions affects the movement / movement of the eyes, which is centered in an area called the superior cauliculus of the middle brain
 essi ek starit sanrachana he jiske str drishy sthal ke do aiami nakshe banaate hai
 a "bump" of neural activity at depths of SC levels dictates movement of the eye at some point observed
 biji kii ore se essi ko ek majboot nirodhatmak prakshepan praapt hota he joki substenshia nigra pars reticulata se nikalataa hota he
 Neurons located in the SNR usually project at a high rate, but they "stop" as soon as the eye movements begin and leave the SC with an inhibitory effect
 esaenar main sabhi prakaar kii netra kii halchal "thamane" se judi he - kintu vyaktigat esaenar neurons kuch prakaar kii halchal / gatividhi se adhik majbootee ke saath jude ho sakate hai
 Neurons in some parts of the caudate nucleus also exhibit eye movement activity
 chunki bahut adhik codet koshika kam dar par prakshepit hoti he, yah kriya adhikansh rup main prakshepan ke dar main badhottaree ke rup main pradarshit hoti he
 Stimulation in the caudate nucleus initiates movement of the eye, demonstrating an antagonistic effect on SNR directly via gabaergic projections
 haalanki motor niyantran main basal gangliya kii bhoomika spasht he, kintu kai sanketon se gyaat hota he kii vah vyavhaar ke niyantran main prerana ke str tak moulik taur par sammilit he
 In Parkinson's disease, the performance of the stirring ability of the components is often not effective, but causative factors such as hunger, fail to initiate movement or fail to release at the appropriate time
 parkinsons rogiyon main gatiheenata ko kabhi-kabhi "ichha kaa lakva" se bhi varnit karte hai
 It has also been observed that the aforementioned patients exhibit a phenomenon called kinesia paradoxia, in which a normally motionless person exhibits a coordinated and energetic response to an emergency and then goes into a state of motion loss

 The Sundering, Splitting Open1
 When the sky is rent asunder, 2
 And hearkens to its Lord, and it must needs; - 3
 And when the earth is flattened out, 4
 And casts forth what is within it and becomes empty, 5
 And hearkens to its Lord, - and it must needs; -
 6
 o thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfully toiling, - but thou shalt meet Him
 7
 Then he who is given his record in his right hand, 8
 Soon will his account be taken by an easy reckoning, 9
 And he will turn to his people, rejoicing! 10
 But he who is given his Record behind his back, - 11
 Soon will he cry for perdition, 12
 And he will enter a Blazing Fire
 13
 Truly, did he go about among his people, rejoicing! 14
 Truly, did he think that he would not have to return! 15
 Nay, nay! for his Lord was watchful of him! 16
 So i do call to witness the ruddy glow of Sunset; 17
 The Night and its Homing; 18
 And the Moon in her fullness: 19
 Ye shall surely travel from stage to stage
 20
 What then is the matter with them, that they believe not? - 21
 And when the Qur'an is read to them, they fall not prostrate, 22
 But on the contrary the Unbelievers reject
 23
 But Allah has full knowledge of what they secrete 24
 So announce to them a Penalty Grievous, 25
 Except to those who believe and work righteous deeds: For them is a Reward that will never fail

 ankiy electronic yaa digital electronics electronics kii ek shakha he jisamen vidyut sanket ankiy hote hai
 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used
 shunya / ek, on / of, haan / nahin, lo / hai aadi binary sanketon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip
 aadhunik vyaktigat computer tathaa cell-phone, digital camera aadi digital electronic kii dein hai
 Numerical electronics, or microtubule numerical method, is a system that represents electrical signals as a series of separate strips, rather than as a continuous band of linear levels
 is pattee ke sabhi str sanketon kii ek hi avasthaa ko darshaate hai
 Because of this separation of signs, relatively small changes in the level of linear signal due to the construction tolerance do not leave a separate cover
 jiske parinaam swarup sanketo kii avasthaa ko mahasoos karne vaala paripath inhe nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 In most cases the number of signal states is two and these two states are represented by two voltage levels: one and the other depending on the supply voltage in use
 1 is at high level and 0 is at low level
 aksar ye donon str "lo" or "hai" ke rup main pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The basic advantage of the numerical technique is based on the fact that instead of reproducing a continuous series of signals, it is easier to send the electronic device to a known state of signals such as 0 or 1
 digital electronics aam taur par logic gates ke vrihad sangyojan va bulian tark prakaarya ke saral electronix se banaaya jaataa he
 One of the advantages of using a numerical circuit compared to a linear circuit is that signals are not disrupted due to noise and can be easily sent and displayed
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1 or 0 ke kram main banaaye huye lambe aawaaj ke ek sanket ko truti ke bina punahnirmaan kiya ja saktaa he basharte sanket banane ke dauraan paidaa hua shor itnaa na ho kii uski vajah se 1 va 0 ko pahachaanaa hi na ja sake
 One hour of music in a CD can be stored as about 60 million binary digits
 ek digital pranali main, ek adhik sateek sanket ke pratinidhitiv ke liye adhik binary ankon kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 However, this process requires more numerical circuits, since each digit is handled by the same type of hardware as a result, creating an easier scalable system
 ek analog system main atirikt rezlushan raikhiktaa main buniyadi sudhaar or sanket shrinkhalaa ke prayek charan ke shor ke abhilakshan main buniyadi sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Computer controlled digital systems can be controlled by software that allows the addition of new functions without changing the hardware
 or aksar ise adhyatan utpaada ke software ke dwaara kaarkaane ke baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 Whereby product design errors can be rectified after the product arrives in the customer's hands
 soochna kaa bhandaaran analog kii tulana main digital pranali main aasaani se kar sakate hai
 The noise immunity of digital systems allows data to be stored and retrieved without disruption
 ek analog system main, puraane or chhijan se shor sangruhit soochna ko nasht karata he
 In a digital system, as long as the total noise is below a certain level, the information can be completely retrieved
 kuch maamalon main digital circuit, ek jaise kaam karne ke liye enlog circuit se zyada urja kaa upyog karti he or is tarah taap utpann hota he
 In portable or battery-powered systems it may limit the use of digital systems
 udhaaharan ke liye bydaree sanchalit celular telephone aksar ek kam shakti ke analog agrasira ke istemaal se base stesan se radio signal badhaane or sangati bithaane ke liye karti he
 Although a base station has grid power and can use the required power, a very flexible software radio
 The signaling process used in such new cellular standards can be easily reprogrammed for such base stations
 digital circuit kabhi-kabhi bahut mahange hote he khaskar choti maatra main
 The senses belong to the world analog and the analog analog quantities from this world
 udhaaharan ke liye prakaash, taapmaana, dhwani, vidyut chaalakata, vidyut or chumbakeey aadhaar analog hai
 The most useful digital systems would be to continuously alter digital signals from analog signals
 yah parimanikaran trutiyon kaa kaaran banataa he
 The quantization error can be reduced if the system stores enough digital data to represent the desired degree of fidelity
 ek nirdhaarit analog sanket ko thik-thik prastut karne ke liye kitni digital data kii aavashyaktaa hoti he uski jaankaree niquist-shannon namoona prameya ek mahatvapurn nirdesh pradaan karata he
 In some systems, if a piece of digital data is lost or misappropriated, the vast amounts of related data can change its meaning completely
 kyonki clif effect ke kaaran, upyogkartaaon ke liye bataanaa mushkil he ki koi vishisht system vifaltaa ke kagaar par sahi tha yaa phir vah asafal hone se pehle bahut adhik shor ko sahan kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 Digital vulnerability can be reduced for robustness by designing a digital system
 udhaaharan ke liye ek parity bit yaa anya truti prabandhan paddati ko signal path main daalaa ja saktaa he
 This method helps the system detect errors and either correct the errors or at least ask for a new copy of the data
 ek state mashin main state transishan logic kaa aprayukt state ko pakadaney or ek riset anukram trigar yaa anya niyamit truti vasuuli ke liye dizin kiya ja saktaa he
 Embedded software design uses immunity aware programming, such as attempting to fill unused program memory with blocking instructions that point to an error recovery program
 is vifaltaa ke khilaaf raksha main madad karata he jo micro controlar anudesh suchak ko bigaad sakate hai, jo anyathaa yadrichhik code ke nishpadit kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Technologies such as digital memory and transmission system error detection and correction can use additional data to correct any errors in transmission and storage
 duusari ore digital pranali main kuch takneekon kaa istemaal un pranaaliyon ke ekal bit trutiyon ko adhik kamjor banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These techniques are acceptable only when the underlying bits are significantly more reliable than those errors are unlikely to occur
 digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai
 Its design should ensure that the characteristics of analog components do not dominate the intended digital behavior
 Digital systems must manage noise and time margins, parasitic routing and capacitance, and filter power connections
 kharaab dizin main aantrayik samasya hoti he jaise gliches, gaayab hoti tej pulces jo ki dusron ko nahin lekin kuch logic ko gati pradaan kar sakate hai, "rant pulse" maanya seemaa voltage tak nahin pahunch pate hai yaa anpekshit logic stats kaa sangyojan hote hai
 Since digital circuits are composed of analog components, the digital circuit calculates slower than low-precision, which uses the same space and power
 haalanki digital circuit iske ucch shor unmukti ke kaaran baar-baar akalan kar paaegaa
 duusari ore, ucch parishuddhta domen main analog circuit ko adhik shakti or digital samakaksh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa he
 a digital circuit is often constructed from a small electronic circuit called logic gates
 prayek logic get boolian logic ke prakriyaayon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 a logic gate is an arrangement of electrically controlled switches
 ek logic get kaa output ek vidyut pravaah yaa voltage hota he jo adhikansh logic gates par niyantran or use mode saktaa he
 Often logic gates use the lowest number of transistors to reduce their size, power consumption and cost, and increase their reliability
 badi maatra main logic gates banane kaa ekikrut circuit kam se kam mahatvapurn tarika he
 Integrated circuits are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 digital circuit kaa doosraa rup lukup teble se nirmit hota he 
 Lookup tables can function like logic gates based on machines but can be easily reprogrammed without changing the strings
 iskaa arth yah he ki diziner, aksar taron kii vyavastha ko badale bina hi dizin trutiyon kii marammat kar sakate hai
 Therefore small amounts of product programmable logic devices are often the preferred solution
 ve aam taur par ejiniyaron dwaara electronic dizin swachaalan software kaa upyog kar dizin kiya jaataa he 
 When versions are medium to large and logic can be slow or complex algorithms or sequences are included, a small microcontroller is often programmed to create embedded systems
 ye aam taur par software ejiniyaron dwaara program kiye hote hai
 When only a digital circuit is required and its design is completely customized, the traditional solution for a factory production line controller is a programmable logic controller or PLC
 ye aam taur par electrician dwaara logic leader kaa upyog karte hue program kiye gaye hai
 Engineers adopt several methods to reduce logic functions, so as to reduce the complexity of the circuit
 jab jatilta kam hoti he tab circuit main trutiyaan or electronics bhi kam hoti hai or isliye ye kam mahange hote hai
 a minimization algorithm like the espresso heuristic logic minimizer is the most widely used simplification within a CAD system although historically binary decision diagrams have used an automated quine-mccluskey algorithm, truth tables, kernog maps, and Boolean algebra
 
 ejeeniyar ke digital circuit ke dizin ke liye pratinidhitiv mahatvapurn hai
 Some analysis methods only work with special representation
 logic geton ke samakaksh set ke saath digital circuit kaa pratinidhitiv shastreey tarika he
 Another approach is to construct a system often equivalent to electronic switches with minimal electronic
 sirf ek truth teble se yukt smriti aasaan tareekon main se ek hota he
 Inputs are inserted at the memory address and the data outputs of the memory become outputs
 swachaalit vishleshan ke liye in prativednon ke paas digital fil swaroop hote hai jise computer program dwaara process kiya ja saktaa he
 Most digital engineers are careful in selecting computer programs with a compatible file format
 prativedan ke liye ejeeniyar digital system ke prakaaron par vichaar karte hai
 Most digital systems are divided into "combinatorial systems" and "sequential systems"
 sangyojan pranali main hameshaa jo input diya jaataa he vahi output vah detaa he
 It basically represents the set of logic processes and which has already been discussed
 anukramik pranali input ke rup main daale gaye output ke saath ek sangyojan pranali he
 This allows the digital machine to operate operationally
 sabase saral anukramik pranali shaayad ek flip flop he, ek yantrawali jo ki ek binary ank yaa "bit" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Sequential systems are often designed as state machines
 is tareeke se ejeeniyar ek system ke sakal vyavhaar ko dizin kar sakate hai or yahaan tak ki logic prakriyaayon ke vivaran par vichaar kiye bina satat anukaran main bhi iskaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, bina tark kaaryon ke sabhi vivaran par vichaar kiye
 The sequential system is further divided into two subcategories
 jab ek "clock" signal state ko parivartit karata he tab "tulykaalik" anukramik pranali ek hi baar main state ko badal detaa he
 "asynchronous" transmits a sequential system change whenever inputs change
 tulykaalik anukramik system atulykaalik circuit kii visheshta se bana hota he jaise flip flop, jo clock jab parivartan karata he tabhi ye parivartan karata he or jisamen timming margin ko dhyaan se dizin kiya jaataa he
 As usual, a synchronous sequential state machine is a practical way to implement by dividing it into a combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a "state register"
 har baar ek ghadi tik tik kii signal detii he or state register sangyojan logic ke pichley state se utpann pratikriya par kabja kar leti he or state mashin ke sangyojan bhaag main aparivertineeya input ke rup main phir se ise daal detii he
 In combination logic, the fastest clock rate is set by most of the time-consuming logic estimations
 state register sirf ek dwiadhari sankhya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 If there are too many states in the state machine, the logic process is some combination logic that produces a number of states
 isaki tulana main atulykaalik system kaa dizin bahut kathin hota he kyonki sabhi sambhav samay main bhi sambhavit state kaa vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 According to the most common method of constructing the minimum and maximum time tables, the state is present in it and the circuit is adjusted to minimize the state and to make the circuit go periodically to the corresponding state of all its parts
 Force it
 Without such careful design, it is easy to produce coincidentally asynchronous logic that is "unstable" and is real electronics that has unpredictable consequences because of small changes in the value of electronic devices due to accumulated delays
 kuch circuit sahaj rup se apane dizin main antarnihit atulykaalik rahe hai or is tarah hi vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 As of 2005 almost all digital machines are synchronous design because synchronous design is very easy to create and verify - currently the software that mimics digital machines does not handle asynchronous design
 However, asynchronous logic is better understood if it can be worked out, because its speed is not arbitrarily limited by the clock speed, instead, it operates normally at the speed allowed by the logic gates from which they are constructed
 has been done
 tej bhaagon ke upyog dwaara ek atulykaalik circuit nirmaan, apratyaksh rup se circuit ko tezi se "daudati" he
 Generally, many digital systems are data flow machines
 aksar inhen tulykaalik register hastantaran logic kaa upyog kar dizin kiya jaataa he or isamen VHDL yaa verilog hardware varnan bhashaaon ke rup main prayog kiya gaya he
 In register transfer logic, binary numbers are stored in groups of flip flops called registers
 prayek register kaa output taron kaa bandal he jise ek "bas" kaha jaataa he jo anya akalan ke liye us nambar ko paas rakhata he
 This assessment is only a part of combination logic
 prayek akalan ke paas ek bas output hota he or ye kai input registeron se judaa ho saktaa he
 Sometimes a register has a multiplexer on its input so that it can store numbers from any one of several buses
 vaikalpik rup se kai chizon ke output ko baphers ke madhyam se joda ja saktaa he jo ek ko chhodkar sabhi upkarnon ke output ko band kar saktaa he
 The sequential state machine controls when new data from each register is accepted from the input
 1980 ke dashak main kuch shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki lagbhag sabhi tulykaalik register-transfar mashiinon ko first-in-first-out tulykaalan logic kaa upyog karke atulykaalik diginon main parivartit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The digital machine, in this scheme, is identified as a set of data flows
 pravaah ke har kadam main, ek atulykaalik "tulykaalan circuit" nirdhaarit karata he jab us step kaa output thos or ek prastut sanket detaa he ki un stejon ko "data ko pakado" jisamen un stejon ke input main prayog hua he
 This requires some relatively simple synchronization circuits
 sabase saamaanya-uddeshy transfar-logic mashin ek computer he
 It is basically an automatic binary abacus
 aam taur par computer kii niyantran ikai kaa dizin ek micro program ke rup main kiya gaya he jise ek microsikvencer dwaara chalaaya jaataa he
 This micro program is like a player-piano roll
 har talika pravishti yaa sookshm program ke "shabd" state ke har bit ko cmand detii he jo ki computer par niyantran karti he
 The sequencer then counts it and addresses this count in a memory or combinational logic machine that contains the micro-program
 microprogram se bits ankaganitiya logic ikai, memory or computer ke anya bhaagon or swayan microsicyonsar par niyantran karata he
 In this way, the complex task of designing computer control was transformed into a relatively simple collection of logic machines
 computer architekchar ek vishesh ejineering gatividhi he jo register, akalan logic, bason or computer ke anya bhaagon ko kuch prayojan ke liye sabase achche tareekon se shreneebaddh karne kii koshish karata he
 The computer architect has applied a large amount of experimentation in computer design to reduce costs and speed up speed and to protect against computer programming errors
 or teji se bydaree paward computer pranali main bijli ko kam karnaa iskaa saadhaaran uddeshy he
 Many computers are serving detailed apprenticeships as Architech microprogrammers
 "vishisht computer" aam taur par ek vishesh uddeshy ke sookshm program ke saath ek paaramparik computer hai
 To avoid costly engineering efforts, efforts to design large logic machines have been heavily automated
 computer program ko "electronic dizine swachaalan upkaran" yaa bas "EDA" kaha jaataa he
 a simple Truth table-style description of logic, often optimized with EDA that automatically generates reduced systems of logic gates or smaller lookup tables that still give the desired results
 is prakaar ke software kaa sabase saamaanya udhaaharan aspreso huristic logic minimiser he
 Most practical algorithms for optimizing large logic systems, using algebraic manipulations or binary decision diagrams and experiments with genetic algorithms and thermal optimization, are full of possibilities
 mahangi ejineering prakriyaaon ko swachaalit karne ke liye, kuch EDA state teble le sakate hai jo state mashin kaa varnan karte hai or ek state mashin ke mishrit bhaag ke liye ek truth teble yaa ek function teble kaa utpaadan kar sakate hai
 The state table is a piece of text that lists each state with conditions, which control the transition between them and the corresponding output signals
 yah aise computer utpann state mashiinon ke function teble ke liye aam he ki unhen logic minimiraseshan software minilog ke saath anukulit kiya jaae
 Often, real logic systems are designed as a series of sub-projects, which are combined using an "instrument flow"
 upkaran pravaah, aam taur par ek "script" hoti he, ek saral computer bhashaa jo sahi kram main software dizin upkarnon ko lagu kar sakati he
 Equipment flow for large logic systems, such as microprocessors, can be thousands of commands long and combine the work of hundreds of engineers
 upkaran pravaah kaa lekhan or dibging, digital dizin kaa utpaadan karne vaali companiyon main ek sthapit ejineering visheshta he
 The tool flow is usually erased into a detailed computer file or set of files that describes how to physically construct the logic

 Parts of the instrument flow are debugged by verifying the output of the simulated logic against the expected input
 pareekshan upkaran, input or output ke set ke saath computer filon ko lete hai or nakli vyavhaar or apekshit vyavhaar ke bich visangatiyon par prakaash daalate hai
 Once the input data is considered correct, the design itself must still be verified for correctness
 kuch upkaran pravaah, pehle ek dizine ke utpaadan dwaara dizin kii pushti karte hai or phir upkaran pravaah ke liye sangat input data ke utpaadan ke liye dizin kii scanning karte hai
 If the scanned data coincides with the input data, the instrument flow probably introduced no errors
 kaaryaatmak satyaapan data, aam taur par "pareekshan vector" kehalaate hai
 The functional test vector can be preserved and used in the factory to test whether the newly constructed logic works correctly
 haalanki, kaaryaatmak pareekshan pattern, aam nirmaan galatiyon kii khoj nahin karte
 utpaadan pareekshan, aksar software upkaran dwaara dizin kiye jate hai jinhen "test pattern janarator" kaha jaataa he
 These tests generate the vector, by examining the structure of logic and systematically generating tests for specific faults

 Productivity software adds interference patterns to expose free-circuits in the exposure mask and increases the resolution and contrast of the mask
 ek badi logic mashin main sambhav state kii ek khagoleey sankhya ho sakati he
 Apparently, in the factory, testing every state is impractical if testing every state takes one microsecond and there are more states than the number of microseconds since the universe began
 durbhaagya se, yah haasyaaspad lagane vaala maamla vishisht he
 Fortunately, large logic machines are almost always produced in conjunction with small logic machines
 samay bachaane ke liye, chote up mashiinon ko, sthaayee rup se sthapit "dizine for test" circuitary dwaara pruthak kiya jaataa he or swatantra rup se jaanch kii jaati he
 a common test scheme, called "scan design", removes test bits sequentially through a gradual shift register named one or more "scan chains"
 kramik scan main, data le jane or baar-baar istemaal naa hone vaale test logic ke bhautik aakaar or kharche ko kam karne ke liye keval ek yaa do taar hote hai
 After all testing, the data bits are in place, the design is reconfigured to "normal mode" and one or more clock pulse is applied, so that faults can be detected and the scan results are captured
 Shift is done in flip-flops in the register and / or in laches
 ant main, pareekshan ke parinaam ko block seemaa main sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he or purvanumaan "good mashin" nattejey ke prati tulana kii jaati he

 digital logic kii ek pranali kii vyaavhaarikta kaa nirdhaaran kai chizein karti hai
 To achieve an ideal combination of fanout, speed, low cost, and reliability, engineers inspected several electronic devices
 ek logic get kii laagat mahatvapurn hoti he
 In the 1930s, early digital logic systems were made from telephone relays because they were cheap and relatively reliable
 uske baad, ejiniyaron ne hameshaa sabase sasta uplabdh electronic switch upyog kiya, jo abhi bhi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa kar saktaa he
 The early integrated circuits were a joyous coincidence

 Improvements in this technology prompted all subsequent improvements in costs
 ekikrut paripathon kii vruddhi ke saath, prayukt chips kii nirpeksh sankhya ko kam karne se laagat bachaane kaa ek or tarika pesh hua
 The goal of a designer is not just to make simple circuits, but to keep the component count low
 kabhi-kabhi yah antarnihit digital logic ke sambandh main thode adhik jatil dizine main parinat hota he, lekin phir bhi ghatakon kii sankhya, board aakaar or yahaan tak ki bijli kii khapat ko kam kar detaa he
 For example, in some logic families, NAND gates are the simplest digital gates to be built
 anya sabhi logic vaali karrwai NAND get dwaara karyanvit kii ja sakati hai
 If a circuit already requires one NAND gate and a single chip typically holds four NAND gates, the rest of the gate can be used to implement other logic operations such as logical end
 yah, un vibhinn prakaar ke get se yukt chip kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 The "reliability" of a logic gate describes its average time between failures
 digital mashiinon main aksar lakhon logic get hote he
 In addition, most digital machines are "optimized" to reduce their costs
 nateeja saafe hota he, ek ekal logic get kii vifaltaa, ek digital mashin ke kaam band karne kaa kaaran banegi
 Digital machines became useful for the first time when the MTBF for a switch exceeded a few hundred hours
 phir bhi, inamen se kai mashiinon main jatiltaayen thim, acchhee tarah se abhyaas kii jane vaali marammat prakriyaayein or ek tub ke jal jane yaa ek keet ke ek riley main funs jane ke kaaran kai ghanton tak kaam nahin karatin thi
 Modern transistor integrated circuit logic gates have approximately one trillion-hour mtbfs), and they are needed because they have a lot of logic gates
 fainout yah varnan karata he ki ek ekal logic output se kitne logic input niyantrit kiye ja sakate hai
 The minimum practical fanout is around five
 aadhunik electronic logic jo switch ke liye CMOS transistor kaa upyog karte hai, unke paas kareeb pachaas ke aas-paas fainout hote hai or kabhi-kabhi bahut oonche ja sakate hai
 "switching speed" refers to how many times an inverter can change from true to false and back
 tej logic kam samay main adhik kaary ko puraa kar sakate hai
 Digital logic became useful for the first time when the switching speed was above fifty Hz, because it was faster than a team of humans operating mechanical calculators
 aadhunik electronic digital logic niyamit rup se paanch gigahertz par parivartit hote hai or kuch prayogshaala pranali ek terrahertz se adhik par parivartit hoti he
 Design started with Riley
 Relay logic was relatively cheap and reliable but slow
 kabhi-kabhi ek yantric vifaltaa bhi ghatit hoti thi
 Fanouts were typically ten, limited by the resistance of the coils and forming an arc upon contact with high voltage
 baad main, nirvaat tub kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 They were very fast, but produced heat and were unreliable due to the burning of the filaments
 fainout aam taur par paanch se saat the, jo tub ke vidyut se heating dwaara simit the
 In the 1950s, special "computer tubes" were developed with filaments that removed volatile elements like silicon
 ye kai hajaaron ghante tak chalate hai
 The first semiconductor logic family was resistor-transistor logic
 yah tub se hazaar guna adhik vishwasaneey tha, aaraam se chalata tha or kam bijli istemaal karata tha, lekin teenon main se bahut nune fain-in tha
 Diode-transistor logic improved fanout to seven and decreased power
 kuch DTL diginon ne fainout main vruddhi ke liye NPN or PNP transistoron kii paryayakramik paraton ke saath do bijli-aapurti kaa upyog kiya
 The transistor was a great improvement over the transistor logic Inn
 aarambhik upkarnon main, fainout das tak sudhara or baad ke viksit prakaar ne bees tak hasil kiya
 TTL was also fast, with some converts achieving a short time of twenty nanoseconds of switching
 TTL abhi bhi kuch dizin main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Another contender was Emitter Coupled Logic
 yah bahut tej he lekin bahut bijli upyog karata he
 It is now mostly used in radio frequency circuits

 utak sanvardhan vah kriya he jisase vividh shaareerik utak athwa koshikaaye kisi bahya madhyam main upyukt paristhitiyon ke vidyaman rahane par poshit kii ja sakati hai
 It is well known that different types of cells in the body have the power to grow according to different stimuli and produce other cells similar to their own
 yah bhi gyaat he ki jeevon main ek aantarik paristhiti bhi hoti he
 Which is more important than external conditions in controlling the functioning of living tissue
 utak-sanvardhan-pravidhi kaa vikaas is moulik uddeshy se hua ki koshikaon ke kaaryakari gunon ke adhyayan kii cheshtaa kii jaae or yah pataa lagaaya jaae ki ye koshikaaye apni bahya paristhitiyon se kis prakaar prabhavit hoti hai or unpar swayan kya prabhaav daalati hai
 For this it was necessary that the cells should be isolated and kept alive in an artificial medium so that the whole organism would not be affected by them

 There are many types of procedures used for tissue culture; Such as those in which hanging point bottles, shallow baskets or other special utensils are used
 sanvardhan ke liye prayukt madhyam vividh prakaar ke hai, jaise raktplavika, lasi, lasika, sharirkriya ke liye upyukt lavan ghol 
 When choosing a medium for tissue culture, a subtle knowledge of the abnormal environment of the organism's cell is essential
 iske atirikt iskaa bhi nirnay kar lenaa aavashyak he ki prayek jati kii koshika ke liye paryaavaran main kya-kya baaten aavashyak hai
 In order to establish the above environment it is also absolutely necessary that no other type of bacteria reach the medium because the medium in which cells are grown is also very good for other bacteria to grow, whether those bacteria are pathogenic or not
 
 in jeevanuon kii vruddhi avashya hi sanvardhaneey koshikaon ko maar daalegi
 Recently, bacterial hostility similar to sulfonamides and penicillin has helped a great deal in suppressing such infections
 madhyam main ugte hue utakon main upapachayee parivartan hote rahete hai or yadi upaapachay se utpann padaarth madhyam main ekatra hote rahenge to koshikaon ke liye ve ghaatak ho sakate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to change the medium even before the quantity of waste is reached
 utak-sanvardhan ke vishay main upar keval thodi si baaten di ja saki hai
 It is important to note that tissue culture is only a helpful method in understanding some biological functions
