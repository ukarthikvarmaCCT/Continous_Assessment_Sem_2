 Circular letter is rotated at a speed and eye near the holes Circular letter is rotated at a speed and the moving object is inspected by placing an eye near the holes
 jab chhidr vastu ke saamne aata he tabhi vastu dikhaai padati he
 If a tremor is rotated at such a speed that at every frequency of the machine, the same part of the machine keeps coming in front of an opening of the rotating sheet, then due to the visibility, the moving machine will be visible to us in a steady but dim light under normal light
 spasht nirikshan ke liye mashin ko atyant teevr prakaash main rahanaa chahie
 If the machine should remain in light instead of uniform intense light

 By this event, any part of a machine can be photographed, inspected and the angular velocity of the machine can be determined

 One of these leaves has a hole in it that it is completely covered by the leaf of the other arm in the position of the larynx and when the arms are stretched while oscillating, the hole opens
 is bhaanti pattiyon ke bich kaa chhidr ek senkad main utani baar khulata or band hota he jitani swaritra aavritisankhya hoti he
 After this, the oscillator is oscillated by electrically driving the oscillator
 vidyut ke prabhaav se swaritra kaa dolan sthaayee bana rahata he
 The telescope holes in the telescope first become blurred, then spread out as the motor speed increases to a full circle
 gati adhik badhane par chhidr alag spasht dikhaai padate hai
 This is possible only when one hole of the frequency bar rotates in place of the adjacent second hole during oscillation of the oscillator
 yadi chakra kii gati tanik kam kar di jaati he to chhidr peeche kii ore dhire dhire ghoomte hue jaan padate hai or yadi gati tanik badhaai jaati he to chhidr aage kii dhire dhire badhate prathit hote hai
 When the holes appear to be clearly stable, the frequency number of the tuner can be determined by looking at the frequency of the spectroscope
 yadi chakra ke vrutt par sa chhidr hai or chakra ek second main m paribhraman karata he to swaritra kii aavritisankhya sa ́m hoti he
 Even if the speed of the frequency bar is exactly double or triple, quadruple, etc
, the holes appear stable in this way

 In such light, if the fan of the table is run or when it is closed by cutting the power, the fan blades are seen to stop, sometimes moving in the opposite direction, then stop and go straight in an increasing or decreasing move
 arthath blade ulataa sidhaa chalate or bich bich main rukate jaan padate hai
 This spectroscopic effect depends on the frequency of light of the tubelight
 yadi pankhe par ekadish dhara ke balb kaa prakaash padataa ho to hamen aisa anubhav nahin hota
 In the same way, when the carriage box is shown moving in the movie, the lighted wheel first stops and stops in the opposite direction, and then it seems to stop

 On this, the light of the arc falls by the rhythm
 taal or vrittakar patr ke bich ek doosraa vrittakar patr k he, jisamen ek lanbaa chhed bana hua he
 Circular letters are rotated differently at different speeds
 Suppose a circular letter a rotates 13 times in a second, then a part of the letter f is published 13 times in a second through its hole
 yadi c ek second main keval ek hi chakkar usee disha main lagaae or chitra ke anusaar yadi pehali damak vrutt 1 par pade to is vrutt ke donon bindu ek duusare ke thik upar neeche dikhaai padenge
 As soon as the second glow reaches, circle 2 will come in place of circle 1 and the points will turn in clockwise direction
 tisare sphuran ke aate hi vrutt 3 aakar vrutt 1 ke sthaan par padegaa ore bindu adhik mude dikhaai padenge
 The circles are all the same and all come to position 1, where the light flashes
 at: vrutt sthir or unke bheetar ke bindu dakshinavart ghoomte dikhaai padenge
 Three elliptical circles have been made near the center of the letter f, in which white black cords are made in alternate order
 madhyavarti vrutt main 13 safed or 13 kaale khaane hai
 The inner circle has 12 white and 12 black cells and the outer circle has 14 such types of food

 One thing should be specially kept in mind
 yadi prakaash kii damak ek second main 13 se kam kar di jaay, to prakashit chakti c kii sataha par jhilamilaahat yaa kanpakanpi dikhaai padati he
 If the number of light flashes per second is increased enough to increase the velocity of the cycle, the tremor goes away and the surface brightness appears permanent

 The end of Thebes silenced Athens and temporarily brought peace to all of Greece
 tab sikandar antipeter ko raaj-pratinidhi ke rup main chhod, apane asian abhiyaan nikal gaya
 After Spitomenes' death and his new marriage to Roxena, Alexander moved his attention to the Indian subcontinent
 usne gandhar ke sabhi pramukhon ko aamantrit kar, unhen apane adhikaar kshetra sikandar ke adheen karne ke liye kaha
 Ambhi, the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus River to the Jhelum River, accepted it, but the chieftains of some hilly regions, including the Ashwanyas and Ashwakyanas of the Kamboj region, refused to oblige
 aambhi ne sikandar ko dosti kaa yakeen dilaane or unhen moolyawaan uphaaron dene, uske sabhi sena ke saad khud uske paas gaya
 Alexander not only returned him his rank and gifts, but he gifted Ambi "persian clothes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 gold talents"

 After victory in this war, Alexander sent Ambi to negotiate with the Purvas, offering conditions like subduing the whole kingdom of Porus to Sikandar, since Ambi and Porus were old enemies, he rejected all the terms and Ambi with great difficulty
 Saved his life and escaped from there
 haalanki iske baad, donon pratidwandviyon ko sikandar ne vyaktigat madhyasthata se mail milaap kara diya; or takshashila ko, jhelum par bede ke liye upkaran or sanybal ke yogadan ke kaaran, aambhi ko jhelum nadi or sindhu ke bich kaa puraa kshetra saunpa diya gaya; machaatas ke bete philip kii mrityu ke baad use or shakti mil gai; sikandar kii maut ke baad or 321 isa purv triparadisus main praanton ke vibhaajan baad ke bhi use apane adhikaar ko barkaraar rakhane kii anumati di gai

 Their responses are seen in proper airflow by hanging small patterns of pests in the tunnel
 vaimaanik samasyaon main vaayu ko paripurna mana ja saktaa he
 In that case, it is a well-known fact that whatever the volume of the body, or its velocity, or the density of the liquid, will be the generation of homogeneous airflows from homogeneously moving bodies
 drav taral ke liye bhi yah satya he
 If velocities larger than 400 mph are encountered, then for symmetry, it is important to keep in mind that the velocities in aquifer experiments have the same ratio of aqueous soundwave as those in airborne experiments, ie the water velocities are approximately four times that of air velocities

 Here m is the viscosity of the liquid, r its density, v the velocity of the body passing through it and 1 is the appropriate length defining the volume of that body, such as its length for the aircraft and its diameter for the sphere
 yadi kisi pravaah kii renold sankhya laghu he, jo us gati main shyanta kaa mahatvapurn prabhaav hoga or vah sire, yaa baari tel, ke jaisaa pravaah degaa
 One of the conclusions of the theory of presumptive liquid is that if a body moves in a liquid that is only left at rest due to the body, then the flow type of the body is uniquely determined by the size and speed of the body
 And the resultant pressure that the liquid exerts at different points on the body is zero, even if their moment is not zero

 As long as the angle of velocity of the liner is not excessive, the liner will have a flowing current, the head will be low and the lifting force will be applied to the liner, which will increase with the emergency angle

 Ernest Hemingway was born on 21 July 1899 in Oak Park, Illinois, USA
 unka puraa naam arnest miller hemingve tha
 His father was a pastoral doctor
 bachapan main hemingve kaa man padhane-likhane main adhik nahin lagata tha
 He ran away from high school many times and did not get higher education at all
 jab vah 18 varsh ke the to us samay pratham vishwa yuddh chal rahaa tha or unki ichha thi ki ve sena main bhartee ho jaaen
 But the doctor called him incompetent
 iske baad ve cansas city main patr-samvaadadaata kaa kaam karne lage
 In 1918, an ambulance at Red Cross was employed as a driver and sent to the fronts of Italy
 1920 i0 main ve phir patrakarita ke kshetra main aaye or lagaataar 1926 i0 tak kaam karte rahe
 Even later, he remained fond of journalism
 hemingve kaa jivan kaaphi sangharmpurn rahaa he
 He also saw a lot of poverty and a lot of wealth when he was successful
 parantu yah safalataa unhen kaaphi sangharsh or apane dhang kii moulik sadhana ke baad hi praapt hui thi
 Hemingway initially spent many years in Paris with poverty
 ve jahaan bhi rahe, un paristhitiyon se prerit hokar lekhan kaary karte rahe
 During his Toronto residency, Hemingway was introduced to Miss Gertude Stein, who impressed him greatly
 ezara pound se bhi unhen saahitiyik sahaayta mili or upanyaaskaar sik madoux ford se bhi
 He was also introduced to James Joyce
 kumari steen ne hemingve ko sandh or manushya kii ladaai dekhne kaa chaska laga diya tha
 He has used this information in his famous story 'death after noon'
 1928 i0 main america laut kar ve 10 varshon tak rahe, jo unke lekhan ke liye kaaphi upyukt rahaa
 In 1941, he went to China as a war correspondent and after returning from there stayed in Havana till his last time
 2 july 1961 i0 ko apane hi ghar par baithe hue bandook saaf karte hue aakasmik rup se goli chal jane se ve apane hi haathon maut kaa shikaar ho gayi
 In early writing Hemingway's work 'three Stories and Ten Poems' was published in 1923 and 'in Our Time' in 1925 AD
 kintu isse unhen na to prasiddhi mili na hi aarthik laabh
 At that time he was in great need of economic cooperation
 1926 i0 main 'san also rijej' prakashit hone par unhen aarthik safalataa mili
 After the publication of 'man Without Women' in 1927, the demand for his compositions increased and his stories began to get abundant in magazines
 1929 i0 main keval 30 varsh kii avasthaa main unki suprasiddh aupnyasik kriti shastr vidaai prakashit hui, jisaki dhooma much gayi or hemingve ko vyapak rup se yash praapt hua
 Since 1918, he made a creative use of the experience of watching the war closely
 hemingve ne sangharmpurn jivan jiya bhi tha or dekha bhi tha
 Also, he had seen death closely many times
 yuddh kshetra kaa unhen vyapak anubhav tha
 He also worked in fishing for about 8 years in his ill condition
 in sab anubhavon kaa unhone rachanaatmak upyog kiya he
 Hemingway was also fond of writing the story for the film and making the film
 is tarah kii kahaniyon main 'macomber' or 'killer' behad prasiddh huin
 His story 'for Hum the Bell Tales' and 'the Snows of Kilimanjaro' were also made into films

 azo yogic aise carbonic yogic ko kehete hai jisamen R-N=N-R' samooh ho jisamen r or R' aril yaa alkil ho sakate hai
 The word 'aijo' comes from the French language 'azote' which means nitrogen
 azo-benazin sabase saral azo yogic he
 It is formed by denaturing nitrobenzene with zinc and alkali, sodium mercury alloys and dilute alcohols or alkaline stannous hydroxide solutions: tulya maatra ke arometic primary amin or nitroso yogic ko sandra aseetic amla ke saath garam karne par azo yogic banate hai or pani mukt hota he : Azo compounds are most commonly formed by adding di azonium salts to primary, secondary and tertiary amines, phenols, or phenolic esters
 is kriya main pehle daai-azonium lavan primary or secondary arometic amin se pratikriya kar daai-azoamino yogic banaate hai: The nitrous acid is reacted on the aniline base in the presence of less mineral acid to form a di-azoamino compound
 daai-azoamino yogic pile rang ke mand kshareey gunwale manibh yogic hai jo amlon se sanyog karte hai, parantu tanba, chaandi or potacium ke lavan bhi banaate hai jinamein nitrogen se sabanddh yah hydrogen chal prakruti kaa hota he or yah ek nitrogen parmaanu se duusare nitrogen parmaanu par ja saktaa he
 The proof of this is that if phenol azonium salts are added to toluidine or tolyl di-azonium salts are added to aniline, the same compound is formed in both cases, otherwise the compound of the formula is formed in the first combination and the compound of the formula in the second combination
 Received: vaastavik bane yogic kaa sutara hota he jisamen adhik dhaneey carbonic tolil mulak amino samooh se sambhddha hota he
 The di-azoamino compounds are converted to amino-azo compounds upon heating the organic alkali with hydrochloride or in the presence of more mineral acids
 yah parivartan paara sthiti se hota he, parantu yadi yahan koi mulak upasthit hua to yah aadan pradaan ortho sthiti se hota he
 Many amino azo dyes are made by this action
 tershiri arometic amin daai-azonium lavan se sangog karte hai or amino-azo-yogic pratyaksh banate hai, jinamein azo samooh tershiri amino samooh ke paara sthaan main judaa rahata he
 Hydroxy azo compounds are formed by the addition of di-anzonium salts to alkaline solutions of phenol
 is kriya main praaia: daai-azoaksaide banataa he
 The strength of phenolic ester to bind to di-anzonium salts is lower than that of amine and phenol
 is kriya ke liye yah aavashyak he ki kriya nirjal sthiti main kii jaae
 Therefore, this action is usually done in concentrated acetic acid
 butad-in jaise asantrupt hydrocarbon or misitelin se nitroeenileen ke daai-azonium yogic sanyog karte hai
 Misetylene combines with dicazonium salts of pricramide and forms an asterisk
 daai-azonium lavan kaa napthol or napthil amin se sanyog vishesh mahatvapurn he
 The alfra-naphthol attaches to the mercury location of the hydroxy group, but if a group is present at this location, it is coincident with the ortho location
 beta-napthol main azo mulak 1 sthaan grahan karata he
 a similar combination occurs in beta-naphthalene
 daai-azo-ammonium lavan amino-hydraxi-amin se kshareey vilyan main hydraxi samooh se judata he, parantu amleey vilyan main yah sanyog amino samooh se hota he
 In this way different types of dyes can be made by making the solution alkaline or acidic with the same amino-naphthol : siddhantanusaar azo yogicon ke sis, trans, do samaavyavi rup hone chahie
 There is not much research yet on this type of isomers
 transazo benazin par prakaash daalane par yah sis-rup main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The alternation and absorption coefficient of Sis isomorphic is different from that of trans isomers
 prakaash ke prabhaav se santulan kii sthiti utpann ho jaati he, jisamen lagbhag 27 pratishat sis- or 73 pratishat trans-samaavyavi rahete hai
 There are two types of azo dyes
 ek ko kshareey ranjak or duusare ko amleey ranjak kehete hai
 In alkaline pigments, aniline yellow, Bismarck brown, Janus red, etc
 are prominent
 anillin yalo kaa rasinic naam paara-amino azobenzin he
 It is a yellow pigment, which turns purple in acid
 bismark brown meta-fenileen-diamin par nitras amla kii kriya dwaara banaaya jaataa he
 This dye is used in dyeing leather
 jenus red ranjak rui or oon ko amleey usmak main rangata he
 It is used in dyeing cotton and wool mixed with wool and silk
 amleey ranjakon main methil orange, elfaa -napthol orange, fast red e or bi, napthil-amin blike di, victoria vilet ityadi pramukh ranjak hai
 
 carbon ke rasinic yogicon ko carbonic yogic kehete hai
 Their number in nature is more than 1 million
 jivan paddati main carbonic yogicon kii bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 These contain carbon as well as hydrogen
 aitihaasik tathaa parampara gat kaarnon se kuch carbon ke yogakon ko carbonic yogicon kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 These mainly include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
 sabhi jaev anu jaise carbohydrate, amino amla, protein, arene tathaa diene carbonic yogic hi hai
 Compounds of carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons
 methen sabase chote anusutra kaa hydrocarbon he
 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandh vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate
 asatrupt hydrocarbon adhik sakriy hota he or anek abhikaarakon se sanyukt ha saralata se vyutpann banaata he
 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic
 anek sugandhit dravya inase taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Similarly the azo compound can also be taken in various experiments

 Bajirao II was the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire from 1796 to 1818
 inke samay main maratha samrajya kaa patan hona shuru hua
 During his reign, conflict with the British began
 bajirao dwitiya aathvaan or antim peshwa tha
 He was the son of Raghunathrao
 apane pradhanmantri naanaa fadanvis se bajirao dwitiya sadaa nafrat karata rahaa
 After the death of Nana Fadnavis, he himself wanted to take charge of the Maratha Empire
 bajirao dwitiya ek kaayar or vishwasghaatee vyakti tha, jisane angrezon kii sahaayta praapt karke peshwa kaa pad praapt kiya tha
 But even with the British, he was not proved to be true
 uski dhokhebaazi or beimaani ke kaaran angrezon ne use bandi banaakar bithur bhej diya, jahaan 1853 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Bajirao II befriended the British and with his help received the post of 'peshwa' and gave many Maratha territories to the British for that
 bajirao dwitiya swaarthee or ayogy shaasha tha tathaa mahattvakankshi hone ke kaaran apane pradhanmantri naanaa fadanvis se irshyaa karata tha
 Fadnavis died in 1800 AD and Bajirao himself became anxious to take power
 lekin vah sainik gunon se rahit or vyaktigat rup se kaayar tha or samajhataa tha, ki keval chal kapat se hi apane lakshya ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 After the death of Nana Fadnavis, there was rivalry between Daulatrao Shinde and Jaswantrao Holkar for his vacant post
 bajirao dwitiya chal kapat se in donon ko hi apane niyantran main rakhana chahta tha, jisase maamla or ulajh gaya
 Shinde and Holkar started a war outside the gates of Poona to take the Peshwa under their control
 bajirao dwitiya ne shinde kaa saath diya, lekin holkar kii sena ne un donon kii sanyukt sena ko parajeet kar diya
 The frightened Peshwa Bajirao II fled to Basai in 1801 and took refuge in the British and signed Basai's treaty on 31 December 1802 on an English ship
 iske dwaara usne east india company kaa ashrith hona sweekaar kar liya
 The British pledged to re-incarnate Bajirao II in the capital Poona and to protect the Peshwa, he took the responsibility of having sufficient army in the state
 iske badale main peshwa ne company ko itnaa maratha kshetra dena sweekaar kar liya, jisase company kii sena kaa kharch nikal aae
 He also promised that he would not hire people from other European countries who had enmity with the British
 is prakaar bajirao dwitiya ne apni raksha ke liye angrezon ke haath apni swatantraaa bech di
 The Maratha chieftains expressed their indignation towards the treaty of Basai, as they felt that the Peshwa had sold all their freedoms due to their queerness
 at: un logon ne is aapattijanak sandhi ko samaapt karaane ke liye yuddh kii taiyaari kii
 This resulted in the Second anglo-maratha War, in which the British won and established their sovereignty over the Maratha territories
 sandhi ke dwaara lagaaye gayi pratibandh peshwa bajirao ko achche nahin lage
 He took advantage of the resentment and discontent prevailing among the Maratha chieftains and re-organized them against the British
 navambar 1817 main bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main sangathit maratha sena ne puna kii 'angrezi residensi' ko lootakar jala diya or khadki sthiti angrezi sena par hamalaa kar diya, lekin vah parajeet ho gaya
 Subsequently, he fought two more battles - Bhima Koregaon in 1 January 1818, in which the British defeated 27,000 Maratha soldiers of Peshwa by his army, which was less than the number of Marathas, including 500 Mahar soldiers
 Later defeated in the battle of Ashti
 usne bhaagane kii koshish kii, lekin 3 june, 1818 i
 ko use angrezon ke saamne aatmasamarpan karnaa padaa
 The British abolished the post of Peshwa this time and overpowered Bajirao II and sent him as a prisoner to Bithoor near Kanpur where he died in 1853 AD
 maraathon kii swatantraaa nasht karne ke liye bajirao dwitiya sabase adhik jimmedaar tha

 In the year 1975, on the occasion of the 2500th Nirvana year of 1008 Lord Mahavir Swamiji, all the Jain communities agreed on it by making a form of symbol of Jainism

 The 24-round circle in the middle of the hand represents the religion practiced by the twenty-four Tirthankaras, whose core sense is non-violence, the four arms of the swastika displayed in the upper part represent the four motions - hell, trian, man and god
 prayek sansari praani janm-mrityu ke bandhan se mukt hona chahta he
 The three points displayed above the swastika reflect the Samyak ratnatraya-samyak philosophy, Samyak Jnana and Samyak character and convey the message that without Samyak Ratnatraya the creature cannot achieve liberation

 sankshep main jain pratik chihn sansari praani maatr kii vartmaan dasha evam isse mukt hokar siddh shila tak pahunchne kaa maarg darshata he
 The Jain symbol is similar to the flag of any ideology, philosophy or party, which can be seen only by looking at who it is related to, but for this it is very important for any symbol to be unique and proportional in all places
