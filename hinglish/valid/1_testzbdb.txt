 Basic education is very important and valuable in the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi to India
 ise wardha yojana, nayi talim, 'buniyadi talim' tathaa 'basic shiksha' ke naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Gandhiji planned a 'new training' on 23 October 1937, which was to be given a nationwide practical form
 unke shaikshik vichaar shikshashastriyon ke tatkaaleen vichaaron se mail nahin khate, isaliye prarambh main unke vichaaron kaa virodh hua
 Gandhiji said that the idea of the new training is his last and best contribution to India
 gandhiji ke jinav-paryant chale satya ke anveshan evam raashtra ke nirmaan hetu sakriy prayogon ke madhyam se lambe samay tak vichaaron ke gahan manthan ke parinamswaroop nayi talim kaa darshan evam prakriya kaa pradurbhaav hua jo keval bharatvarsh hi nahin, apitu sampoorn maanav samaaj ko ek nayi disha dene main sakasham tha
 But unfortunately this best welfare education system could not be used properly even at the national level, due to which till today this country was unable to achieve meaningful and right swaraj as per Gandhiji's dream
 balki iske vipareet aaj to alam yah he ki shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik drushti se bharat punah paashchaatya samrajyavad ke adheen nirantar sarakta chalaa ja rahaa he
 Today, most of India's education system is dependent on the state or capitalists
 adhikansh rajashrith shikshan-sansthaayen sansaadhan evam anushaasan ke abhaav main niskriy hai
 Therefore, are unable to provide quality education
 isi prakaar poojipatiyon par ashrith sabhi shikshan-sansthaaen vyavsaayik rup main sakriy hai, jo garibon kii pahunch se baahar hai
 Only children of rich people can study in them
 bharat kii swadhinata ke 60 se adhik varsh bitne ke pashchaat bhi aise bacchon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik he, jinhone vidhyalay ke dwaar tak nahin dekhe hai
 Those who have the ability to go to school do not receive anything other than the tradition of English education from Lord Macaulay
 kul milakar unamem bhartiya moulik shiksha ko grahan karanevaale shaayad hi koi mili
 It is not that there is a lack of Indian teachers
 parantu isliye ki sabhi abhibhavakon main yah ichhashakti evam saahas nahin he ki apane bacchon ko sarkaron athwa puunjipatiyon dwaara nirdhaarit angreji shiksha ko tyagkar bhartiya shiksha dilaawein
 Till this cowardly mentality of the general public will not be changed, no Indian educational system including new training can flourish in this country
 22–23 oktober, 1937 ko wardha main jo 'akhil bhartiya shaikshik sammelan' yojit hua, uski adhyakshata gandhiji ne kii
 In his inaugural address, Gandhiji highlighted important aspects of his teaching
 uske baad unki 'nai talim' yojana ke anek pahaluon par khuli charchaa hui
 Many scholars including the famous Gandhian educationist Vinoba Bhave, Kaka Kalelkar and Zakir Hussain participated in this discussion
 sammelan ke antim din nimnlikhit prastaav paarit kiye gayi- After these proposals were passed, a committee of experts was formed under the chairmanship of Dr
 Zakir Hussain, who was given the task of preparing practical courses based on these proposals
 in prastaavon ke aadhaar par ek rashtriya shaikshik yojana taiyaar kii gayi jo desh bhar main 'nai talim', 'buniyadi shiksha' yaa 'wardha yojana' ke naam se prasiddh hui
 As a result of the declaration of the Government of India Act of 1935, when the Congress governments in seven provinces of British India formulated a program for national reconstruction, basic education was also a cornerstone in its fourteen pillars
 gandhi ji buniyadi shiksha ko saamaajik parivartan kaa ek saadhan samajhate the
 They considered it to be a major basis of a quiet social revolution
 ve vyakti ke shaareerik, maansik tathaa aadhyatmik pakshon ke punarnirmaan dwaara saamaajik kranti kaa ek pramukh aadhaar maanate the
 They wanted to bring about a social revolution by rebuilding the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the person
 aatmavishvaas evam aatmanirbharta ko hi unhone manushya ke purna vikaas kaa aadhaar mana
 He considered education as the birthright of every person
 isiliye unhone saat se chaudaa varshavaale varg ke sabhi baalkon evam balikaon ko ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha dena aavashyak samajha
 After the acceptance of the Basic National Education Scheme at the Haripur session of the Indian National Congress, since 1938, many experiments in basic education started but they were done at different and limited levels
 san 1939 i
 main dwitiya mahayuddh ke chhid jane se ek or kathinaayee upasthit ho gai
 The Congress cabinet had to resign due to political reasons
 unase yah aashaa kii jaati thi ki ve buniyadi shiksha ke vikaas main sahaayak honge
 But as a result of his resignation, experiments were stopped altogether in some provinces and indifference to experimentation began to appear in other provinces
 swatantraprapti ke baad hi buniyadi shiksha ko shiksha kii rashtriya paddati ke rup main gambhirthapurvak sweekaar kiya gaya
 Basic education continued to progress as the number of basic schools continued to grow
 kintu saadhaaran praarambhik or middle skulon kii apeksha basic skulon kii sankhya kii vruddhi kii gati main kami rahi he
 The status of admission to basic schools has not been satisfactory
 lakshya to yah tha ki basic shiksha main 6 se 14 varsh ke vargvaale sabhi ladakon evam ladakiyon ke liye buniyadi shiksha kaa prabandh kiya jaae
 But no significant progress was made in the first two schemes in this education
 is kaal main buniyadi shiksha ke prasar kii pragati utani bhi nahin hui jitani saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha ke prasar kii, yadhyapi saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha kii pragati bhi santoshjanak nahin he
 The condition of teacher teaching is also not satisfactory at all
 bharat main praarambhik shikshakon kii shiksha ke bare main pratham rashtriya vichaargoshtee kii 1960 i
 kii report or haal main adhyaaapak prashikshan ke sambandh main plan projects kii samiti kii 1963 i
 kii report se siddh hota he ki adhyaaapak prashikshan kaarykram main anek trutiyaan hai
 It has not only lacked proper and qualified staff, buildings, equipment and other macro resources but has also been blamed for inadequate curriculum and ineffective method and style of teaching
 buniyadi shiksha kii koi spasht paribhaasha nahin he jisase log saadharantaya sahamat hon
 There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the basic fundamentals and definite goals of basic education
 gandhi ji ne buniyadi shiksha ke siddhanton ko pratipaadit karte samay ek nishchit saamaajik vyavastha kii kalpana kii thi
 He considered productive work as the center of education, but in actual use, the principle of education by productive work has different meanings
 kuch shikshavid, jo gandhi ji ke anuyaayi hone kaa daawa karte hai, vidyalayon main prayog yogya vastuon ke vaastavik utpaadan par jor dete hai
 Some people believe that this means nothing but education through sports law
 buniyadi shiksha main aatmanirbharta kaa prashn or bhi vivadpurn he
 Gandhiji considered self-reliance as the real criteria of education
 aatmanirbharta se unka taatpary yah tha ki basic skool is seemaa tak swaavlambee ho jaaen ki adhyapakon kaa vetan vidyalayon main bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ko bechakar diya ja sake
 Therefore, initially a very large section of the supporters of basic education started to hope that if a proper environment is created for basic education, then the expenditure on it will be expended and the government will pay the remaining expenses so that basic schools can run efficiently
 kintu anubhav se yah anumaan galat siddh hua
 The pires-lakhani Committee appointed by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, studied this problem and stated that no school was more than 41
09 percent self-supporting in 1950–1951 in Bihar, which was considered to be the primary state of basic education
 sewagram kaa basic skool, jo hindustani talimi sangh ke pathpradarshan evam nirikshan main chal rahaa tha, 63 pratishat tak swaavlambee tha
 Isanan had the distinction of getting first place in the list of basic schools in this direction
 san 1949-1950 main bihar pradesh ke 100 basic skool, jinamein 18 senior basic skool bhi the, keval 15 pratishat hi swaavlambee ho sake
 Since then, in general, there is no change in the situation towards goodness
 bharat sarkaar dwaara buniyadi shiksha ke liye pratham panchavarshiya yojana ke ant main jo moolyankan samiti niyukt hui thi vah bhi isi nishkarshan par pahaunchi
 The Government of India did not even mention self-reliance in the booklet titled 'concept of Basic Education'
 yahan tak ki gandhivaad ke aadarshon ke mahan poshak vinoba bhaave kaa bhi ab yah vichaar ho gaya he ki bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ke vikray kaa laabh shiksha par honevaale uchit kharch ke kam karne par prayog na kiya jaae balki vah abhibhavakon ko milanaa chahie jisase ve apane kaam main apane bacchon kii sahaayta se laabh na uthaa sakane ke kaaran hui kshati ko puraa kar saken
 It seems that the government, in principle, accepts that the profits derived from the productive work of children should be spent in their own interest, such as managing school clothes or mid-day meals
 isliye yah nishkarsh to nikaala hi ja saktaa he ki gandhi ji kii kalpana ke anusaar basic skulon main utpaadak vyavsaayon ko aarambh kar dene se buniyadi shiksha kaa kharch badi maatra main kam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, if basic education is to be made a universal method of elementary education across the country, then for this, an economically abundant economy is necessary
 buniyadi shiksha ko saarvbhaum banane ke prashn ko yatharth ke str par sochna chahie
 India has pledged to establish a society with socialist ideals
 aise samaaz kii anivaary baton main se ek yah he ki iske sabhi sadsy sushikshit hon taaki ve saamaanya hit ke liye adhik se adhik yogadan kar saken or apane sammilit praytn kaa jo fal ho usase uchit rup se laabh uthaa saken
 Therefore, universal, free and compulsory education should be the first to be managed within the shortest possible time
 samvidhan kii 45 veen dhara ke anusaar 1960 i
 tak 14 varsh kii avasthaavale sabhi bacchon kii ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha kaa rajya kii ore se prabandh ho janaa chahie tha
 This is a huge problem and great solutions, both human and physical, are needed to solve it
 yah anumaan he ki yadi desh apni rashtriya aay kaa do pratishat keval praarambhik shiksha par kharch kare to aavashyak saadhan itani maatra main praapt kiye ja sakate he ki chad se 14 varshavaale varg ke sabhi bacchon ko shiksha kii suvidhaayen 1980-1981 tak praapt ho jaaen
 Now, if basic education is given to all children, it will take much longer to reach the level of universal education
 buniyadi shiksha ucch koti kii hone ke kaaran adhik mahangi he
 It is clear from the recommendations of the Auxiliary Committee appointed by the National Committee on Basic Education that the development of elementary education as well as basic education, keeping in view the minimum means required to convert an ordinary elementary school into a basic school Seems necessary
 aavashyaktaa is baat kii he ki ek doordarshee yojana banaai jaae jiske anusaar buniyadi shiksha kaa vistaar baraabar hota rahe taaki ant main yah rashtriya str par praarambhik shiksha kii sudhari hui paddati ke rup main viksit ho jaae
 Some things that need to be done are proposed below: paramparaagat siddhanton par hi kaam kar rahe basic skulon ko kam se kam anivaary sharton kii purti karte hue sachche basic skool bananaa chahie
 The schools which have not been fully developed should be given maximum help so that they become ideal basic schools and others should follow them
 buniyadi shiksha ke vistaar ko lagaataar badhaate rahen
 Convert ordinary schools to basic schools and open new basic schools
 adhikansh pradesh basic skulon kii sankhya ko prativarsh kam se kam 5 pratishat to badha ho sakate hai
 While choosing industries for basic schools, it should be kept in mind that the industries should be prosperous in terms of education and adapt to the social environment and condition of children
 kachche maal kii barabaadi ko rokane ke liye basic skulon kii nimna shreniyon main udyog sambandhi kaary us samay tak na karaayaa jaae jab tak bachche itane paripakv na ho jaaen ki ve iskaa prayog laabhpurvak kar saken
 Soil work, elementary gardening or some low-cost hand work can be done in the lower classes
 buniyadi shiksha ke paathyakram main is aadhaar par parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some elements of basic education can be easily adopted in all elementary schools, such as health-related activities, social service programs, cultural activities, etc
 aisa vidhyalay, jiske paas paryaapt maatra main bhoomi ho or sinchai kii suvidhaayen paryaapt hon, fal or tarkariyon ke utpaadan kaa kaary kar saktaa he
 It is necessary that the schools in which these activities are started should be properly planned and at the same time, full educational benefit should be taken from them
 uttar buniyadi vidhyalay ko bahuddeshiy ucchtar madhyamik vidhyalay kii ek shakha samajhnaa chahie jahaan us udyog main yogyata praapt karne par bal diya jaae jise ek chaatr basic skool se karata chalaa aayaa he
 In 1957, the Central Advisory Board of Education, on the opinion of the committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Education for detailed study in this matter, insisted that basic basic education should remain a part of the prevailing secondary education system of the country
 basic skool kii shaikshik yojana ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki adhyapakon kii shaikshik prishthbhumi ucch koti kii ho or ve apane kaary main praveen hon
 All the training institutions that prepare teachers for elementary schools should be of basic style
 prayek pradesh ke prayek jile main ek adarsh prashikshan vidhyalay sthapit kiya jaae
 Four to five basic schools should be attached to this training school
 is centre main paryaapt rup se adhyaaapak evam upkaran hon or buniyadi shiksha kaa sampurna kaarykram isi ke dwaara puraa kiya jaae
 It should be an integral part of a multi-disciplinary college of training which has many training institutes to prepare teachers for all levels of education and different branches of the school program
 1938 main buniyadi shiksha kii moulik yojana jakir hossain samiti ne taiyaar kii thi
 In it, it was recommended that a committee of education should be set up in every province whose functions should also include the work of search and organization in basic education
 prayek pradesh main sthapit shiksha kii pradeshy sanstha buniyadi shiksha kii vividh samasyaon kaa adhyayan tathaa anusandhan kaary kare
 The National Council of Educational Research and Training should research problems of national importance
 anusandhan dwaara samavaay paddati ko adhyaaapak ke liye subodh tathaa sugam bana diya jaae
 There are some main problems related to basic education that need immediate attention to solve, such as the problem of teaching multiple classes by the same teacher, the problem of teaching classes in which the number of children is very large, of different industries
 To explore the educational possibilities and develop their method and production capacity by which to check how far weaving The progress of Hindi education is being made according to its objectives so that the teachers and administrators of basic education can benefit from these methods and tools as needed, to pay attention to the problems of training institutions preparing teachers for basic schools so as to make the training program effective
 And to pay attention to the preparation of appropriate literature for the students

 Acharya of the temple, Hari Om Pathak, tells that the mother Pitambara, who is in the form of the quadrilateral, has mace in one hand, loop in the other, Vajra in the third and in the fourth hand, she has held the tongue of the demon

 lekin is darbar main bhakton ko maa ke darshan ek choti si khidki se hi hote hai
 darshanathiyon ko maa kii pratimaa ko sparsh karne kii manaahi he
 It is believed that Mother Bagulamukhi is the Pitambara Devi, so yellow things are offered to her
 But pleasing the mother is not so easy
 For this, special rituals have to be done, in which the devotee has to wear yellow clothes, yellow things are offered to the mother and then they are asked to ask
 kehete hai vidhi vidhaan se agar anushthathan kar liya jaae to maa jald hi puri kar detii hai bhakton kii manokamana

 Along with the mother Pitambara in the temple, the fortunes of Khandeshwar Mahadev and Dhumavati are also found
 On the right side of the temple sits Khandeshwar Mahadev, who is worshiped in a tantric form
 As soon as Mahadev steps out of the court, one of the ten Mahavidyas, mother Dhumavati is seen
 The most unique thing is that the devotees get the fortunes to see Maa Dhumavati only during the aarti, because the doors of the temple remain closed for the rest of the time
 maa peetambara ke vaibhav se sabhi kii manokamana puri hoti he

 This dangerous disease soon came to be known as sweating disease
 It is considered to be different from the plague, which was formerly known as lethal fever or other epidemic, it received its name not only because of its specific symptoms, but also due to its rapid spread and malignancy
 paseene kii beemaari 1492 tak ireland pahunch chukaa tha, usee samay alstor ke itihaas, main ireland main pehali baar aae, plagh aliyas ke slen ke vyapaaree james fleming kii mrityu darj kii gai thi
 This obituary was also recorded in the history of Connacht and an unusual plague was recorded over a 24-hour period in the history of the Four Masters; And after that period, those who were found to be at risk of it were treated
 isse shishu yaa chote bachche prabhavit nahin hue the
 However, it is worth noting that Freeman has denied in Connacht's history footnote that despite the similarity in name, it was a plague sweating disease, but rather a 'relapse or fever with famine', possibly typhus

 a second less widespread outbreak occurred in 1507, followed by a third in 1517, which led to some serious epidemics
 In Oxford and Cambridge, as well as other cities, its effects were very deadly, in some cases said to have caused half the population
 Was destroyed kalas or entwarp main iske prakope ke failane ke pramaan mili hai, lekin england se baahar kisi or sthaan par koi pramaan nahin mila
 In 1528, the disease occurred for the fourth time and with great severity
 ise pehali baar landan main may ke ant main mahasoos kiya gaya or yah uttar ko dur chhodte hue, scotland or ireland ko bakhshate hue bahut tezi se sampurna england main fail gaya
 The death rate in London was very high; The court was quashed and Henry VIII left London and continued to change residence
 The most notable fact of the epidemic is its spread in Europe, it suddenly appeared in Hamburg and began to spread very rapidly and thousands of people died over a period of a few weeks
 iske baad paseene ke beemaari kaa vinaashkari rup jari rahaa, is dauraan purvi europe main main mrityu dar ucchtam str par thi

 It was present for a very short time in every place infected by it, nowhere it remained more than a fortnight
 By the end of the year, it had completely disappeared in all places, except eastern Switzerland, where its effects were seen the following year
 iske baad, yah kabhi bhi europe kii dharti par dobaaraa dikhaai nahin diya
 The last major outbreak of the disease occurred in 1551 in England
 ek prakhyat chikitsak, jon sis ne rog kaa pratyaksh bayaan likhaa he, jise aaj ke samay main saamanyatya pasinaa yaa paseene kii beemaari kahe jane vaale rog ke viruddh e bok yaa kancel kaha jaataa he
 Symptoms and signs described by Sayes and others are as follows: The disease begins with the possibility of becoming suddenly ill, followed by symptoms such as cold fever, dizziness, headaches, and extreme pain in the neck, shoulders, and legs
 
 thandi avasthaa ke baad, jo ki lagbhag aadhe ghante se teen ghante tak rahata he, garmi lagati he or saath hi pasinaa aane lagata he
 Sweating starts for no apparent reason
 paseene ke saath-saath yaa pasinaa nikal jane ke baad, garmi lagane lagati thi, sirdard hota tha, unmaad aane lagata tha, naadee ho jaati thi or teevr pyaas lagane lagati thi
 Nervousness and heartache were common symptoms
 sis sahit prekshkon dwaara twachaa main kisi prakaar kaa daad note nahin kiya gaya tha
 In the final phase, there was either all-round drowsiness and sleepiness, or a strong desire to sleep, which according to Sayes could be fatal if the patient were allowed to do so
 One stroke did not decrease immunity, but many suffered extreme pain due to multiple strokes before death
 yah rog england main 1578 tak vilupt rahaa, haalanki isi prakaar kii ek beemaari, jise picardi pasinaa ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, 1718 or 1861 ke bich main france main dikhaai di, lekin vah utani ghaatak nahin thi or yah chakatta ke sangat tha, jo ki praarambhik prakope ke kisi bhi lakshan kaa hissaa nahin tha
 The cause of the disease is its most mysterious aspect
 tab or aaj ke tippaneekar saamaanya gandagi or us samay ke mel ko iskaa doshi maanate hai, jo ki sankraman kaa strot ho saktaa he
 The first outbreak of roses at the end of the war meant that the disease may have been brought from France by French soldiers hired by Henry VIII to obtain the English throne, especially because It seems that they were immune
 haalanki, darbi ke pehle arl, thomas stanley ne "paseene kii beemaari" kaa upyog boseworth ke yuddh se pehle richard tritiy kii sena ke saath nahin judane ke liye bahaane ke rup main kiya tha, isse yah spasht he ki henry tuder ke aane se pehle england main yah beemaari apane pair pasaar chuki thi
 Due to the spread of the disease among the rich more than the poor, it was termed more poisonous than other diseases that occurred during that period
 punaravarti bukhaar ko ek sambhavit kaaran mana jaataa he
 This disease spread by ticks and lice can be seen most often during the summer months, because during this time sweating occurs
 haalanki, punaravarti bukhaar ko tik ke kaatane ke sthaan par hue sthaayee kaale dhabbe ke nishaan or anuvarthi twachaa chaktaa se chihnit kiya jaataa he, jabaki samasamayik vyakti in praasangik spasht sanketon ko dekh nahin paae, isliye isaki pahchaan nischitata se koshon dur he
 The chronic fatigue syndrome suggested by Chaudharia and Behn shares the diagnosis of Bornholm disease, based on a 1934 article on the outbreak of lethal muscular pain
 abhi haal hi main, ek hanta virus bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he or is beemaari ke hetuvigyaan par vichaar karne ke liye ek dilachasp ummidavaar dikhaai detaa he
 However, some of the medical features of the outbreak of the Hanta virus are not helpful in the development of sweating disease; In particular, while the Hanta virus is much less likely to be infected from one person to another, it is still considered an important factor in the infection of sweat disease
 yadhyapi hanta virus phuffusiya syndrome prakope kaa nidaan paseene kii beemaari ke nidaan ke varnan se kaaphi miltaa-julata he, phir bhi kai aise prashn ab bhi hai, jinka uttar diya janaa aavashyak he or inhen kaarnon se hetuvigyaan ke siddhant ke liye raste khule hai

 NTSC is also the name of the American standardization body that developed the broadcast standard
 pehla NTSC maanak 1941 main viksit kiya gaya tha or usame rangeen tivi ke liye koi praavdhaan nahin tha
 a second revised version of the NTSC standard was approved in 1953, allowing for color transmissions compatible with the existing stock of black and white receivers

 After at least half a century of use, a large number of over-the-air NTSC transmissions were converted from ATSC in the United States on June 12, 2009, and will also be converted to Canada by August 31, 2011

 In January 1950, the committee was restructured to standardize color television
 1953 disambar main, samiti ne sarvasammati se ise sweekaar kar liya jise ab NTSC color televijan maanak kaha jaataa he
 The "friendly color" standard maintains full backward compatibility with existing black and white television sets
 video signal main 455 / 572 × 4
5 mhz kaa color sabakarier jodakar blike-and-white image main rangeen jaankaree jodi gayi thi
 Sound carriers are required to reduce the visibility of interference between the chrominance signal and the FM, so that the frame rate varies from 30 frames per second to about 29
97 frames per second and the frequency is from 15,734
26 Hz to 15,750 Hz
 FCC ne ek bhinn color televijan standard ko anumodith kiya jo oktober 1950 main shuru hua tha or CBS dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 However, this standard was not compatible with black-and-white transmissions

 The first color NTSC television camera was the RCA TK-40 used for experimental broadcasts in 1953; An improved version of the TK-40A was introduced in March, becoming the first commercially available color TV camera
 baad main usee varsh sanshodhit TK-41 maanak camera ban gaya jo 1960 ke dashak main istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The NTSC standard has been adopted by most other countries including Japan and the US
 digital televijan ke aagaman ke saath, analog prasaaran khatm hota ja rahaa hai
 In 2009, the FCC required most American NTSC broadcasters to shut down their analog transmitters

 Each frame has a total of 525 scan lines, of which 486 lines form a clear raster
 shesh tulykaalan or urdhwadhar pratidhaav hetu upyog kii jaati hai
 This blanking interval was originally designed to simply empty the receiver CRT to allow for simpler analog circuits and slower vertical response to earlier TV receivers
 However, some of these lines may now also include data such as limited caption and vertical interval timecode

 The NTSC field refresh frequency of the black-and-white system is essentially the same as the nominal 60 Hz frequency of alternating current power used in the United States 
 power sorce se field rifresh rate kaa milan intermadulation se bachaata he jiske kaaran screen par rolling bars kaa utpaadan hota hai, baad main jab system main rang joda gaya, to rifresh aavriti ko thodaa neeche 59

 Incidentally the synchronization of the refresh rate with power helps kinescope cameras record pre-live television broadcasts, as it was very easy to synchronize a film camera to capture a frame of video on each film frame using alternating current frequency So that the speed of synchronous AC motor drive camera can be set
 Over time the frame rate for color dropped to 29
97 Hz, almost as easy as triggering the camera shutter from the video signal
 525 linon kii sankhya ko vaikum tub aadhaarit takneekon kii simaaon ke ek parinaam ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 In earlier TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator ran at twice the frequency of the horizontal line frequency and this frequency was divided by the number of lines used to obtain the field frequency)
 This frequency is then compared with the 60 Hz power-line frequency and any discrepancies are corrected by adjusting the frequency of the master oscillator

 Beginning in the late 1950s, picture tube phosphorus will sacrifice saturation for excessive brightness; This deviation from the standard was a source of considerable color variation at both receiver and broadcaster boundaries
 adhik samaan rang kaa prajnan sunishchit karne ke liye, resiver ne aise rang sudhaar circuit samilit karne shuru kar die he jo praapt signal---upar soochibaddh varnmiti mulyon ke liye encoded---ko vastav main resiver main upyog hone vaale phosphorus hetu encoded signal main parivartit karata he
 Since such color corrections cannot be applied correctly to the transmitted nonlinear signals, one can almost guess the adjustment, which leads to high-saturated colors and a luminance error
 isi tarah prasarak manch par, 1968-69 main konra corporation, jo RCA ke saath kaam kar rahi he, prasaaran color pikchar monitor main upyog hetu niyantrit phosphorus ke ek set ko paribhaashit karata he
 This specification still survives as the SMPTE "C" phosphor specification: gharelu resiver kii tarah, pehle aisi salaah di gayi thi ki studio monitors samaan rang sudhaar circuit ko sammilit kare jisase prasarak FCC maanak ke anusaar mul 1953 varnmiti mulyon ke liye encoded chitron ko sanchaarit kare
 In 1987, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, a committee on television technology, the Working Committee on Studio Monitor Colorimetry, accepted SMPTE c phosphorus for general use in Recommendation Practice 145, which allowed many manufacturers to do without color correction
 Encouraged to modify its camera design to encode directly to SMPTE "C" colorimetry, as in SMPTE standard 170M, "misht
" Per analog video signal --- Studio has been recognized in NTSC "to the application
 parinaam swaroop, ATSC digital tivi maanak yah spasht kiya he ki 480i signlles ke liye, SMPTE "C" varnmiti ko sweekaar kar lenaa chahie jab tak parivahan stream main varnmiti data ko sammilit naa kar liya jaye
 The Japanese NTSC uses the same colorimetric values for red, blue, and green, but the CIE uses a different white approach to the illuminated D93
 1970 tak PAL or SECAM systams donon mul 1953 NTSC varnmiti kaa upyog karte hai, tathaapi NTSC ke vipareet, 1970 main european broadcasting union resiver or studio main se rang sudhaar ko hataa diya or iske bajaay unhone sabhi upkarnon ke liye "EBU" varnmiti maan hetu sidhe signlles ko encode karnaa uchit samajha, jisane in systams kii rang nishtha ko or sanshodhit kar diya
 For backward compatibility with black-and-white television, the NTSC uses a luminance-chrominance encoding system invented in 1938 by Gorges Valancy
 luminans mul monocrome signal kii jagah letaa he
 Chrominance contains color information
 yah blike-and-white resiver ko chrominance kii andekhi karke NTSC signlles pradarshit karne kii anumati detaa he
 In NTSC, chrominance is encoded using two 3
579545 mhz signals
 These signals are outside the 90 degree phase, called i and q QAM
 yah donon signlles aayam modulatted hote hai or phir ek saath jode jate he
 Carrier is suppressed
 ganitiya rup se, parinaam swaroop aap bhinn phej ke saath ekal sin wave dekh sakate hai
 The phase displays the instantaneous color captured by a TV camera and the amplitude displays the instantaneous color saturation
 i / q phej se hae jaankaree pun: praapt karne ke liye, TV ke paas shunya phej sandarbh ko badalane ke liye dabaa hua karier hona aavashyak he
 It also requires a reference for amplitude to obtain saturation information
 at:, NTSC signal ke paas is sandarbh signal kaa chota namoona hota he, jise color barst kehete he, jo prayek kshaitij rekha ke 'back porch' par sthit he 
 color barst main anamodulatted color sabakarier ke nunatam aath chakron ko sammilit kiya jaataa he
 The TV receiver has a "local oscillator" that it synchronizes with the color burst and then uses it as a reference to decode chrominance
 rekhapunj scan main ek khaas bindu par color barst se praapt sandarbh signal tathaa chrominance signal ke aayam or phej kii tulana karke, upkaran yah nirdhaarit karata he ki us bindu par kya chrominance pradarshit hoga
 luminans signal ke aayam ke saath sanyojit karke resiver yah gananaa karata he is bindu arthath lagaataar scanning beam kii taatkaalik sthiti vaala bindu, ke nirmaan hetu koun se rang kii aavashyaktaa he
 Note that analog TV is different in vertical dimension, but continuous in horizontal dimension, so analog TV does not have pixels
 jab ek transmeter ek NTSC signal kaa prasaaran karata he, yah aayam haal main hi varnit NTSC ke saath radio aavriti karier ko modewllett karata he, jabaki yah aavriti audio signal ke saath karier 4
5 megahertz ucch ko modewllett karata he
 If a non-linear distortion signal is to propagate, the 3
579545 mhz color carrier may collide with the sound carrier to produce a dot pattern on the screen
 parinamswaroop praapt hue pattern ko kam dhyaan yogya banane ke liye, diziner ne 60 hertz ke mul field rate ko lagbhag 1
001 kam karke 59
94 fields prati second samyojit kar diya he
 This adjustment ensures that the addition and spacing of the sound carrier and color subcarrier and their multiples are not an exact multiple of the frame rate, a key requirement for the dots on the screen to remain stable, making them more noticeable
 59
94 dar nimnlikhit gananaa se praapt hota he
 Designers prefer to make the chrominance subcarrier frequency a n +0
5 multiple of the line frequency to minimize interference between the chrominance signal and the luminance signal
 They then make the audio subcarrier frequency an integer multiple of the line frequency so as to minimize the apparent interference between the audio signal and the chrominance signal
 The original black-and-white standard with 15750 Hz line frequency and 4
5 mhz audio subcarrier does not meet these requirements, so designers have to either increase the audio subcarrier frequency or reduce the line frequency
 audio sabakarier aavriti main vruddhi maujuuda resiver ko thik se audio signal main tuning karne se roak sakati he
 Lowering the line frequency is relatively innocuous, as horizontal and vertical synchronization information in the NTSC signal allows a receiver to tolerate a substantial amount of variation in line frequency
 isliye ejiniers rang maanak ke liye rekha aavriti ko badalanaa chunate hai
 In the original black-and-white standard, the ratio of audio subcarrier frequency to line frequency is 4
5 mhz / 15750 = 285
71
 rang maanak main, yah lagbhag 286 purnank ban jaataa he, jiskaa arth he ki rang maanak kaa line rate 4
5 megahertz / 286 = lagbhag 15,734 line prati second he
 To maintain the same number of lines per field scan, a lower line rate gives a lower field rate
 lines prati second ko prati field 262
5 linon dwaara bhaag dene par prati second lagbhag 59

 The NTSC television channel occupies a total bandwidth of 6 mhz when it is broadcast
 vaastavik video signal, jo aayam-aaparivartan he, channel ke lower bound ke upar 500 khz or 5
45 megahertz ke madhya prasaarit hota he
 The video carrier is 1
25 mhz above the channel's lower bound
 zyaadaatar AM signlles kii tarah, video karier do cidband, ek karier ke upar or ek neeche, utpann karata he
 Each sideband is 4
2 mhz wide
 sampurna upree cidband prasaarit hota he, lekin lower cidband kaa keval 1
25 megahertz, jise vestigial cidband kehete he, hi prasaarit hota he
 The color subcarrier, as noted above, is above the video carrier at 3
579545 mhz, and is a carrier with quadrature-amplitude-modifier
 audio signal aavriti-aaparivartan he, jaise ki 88-108 megahertz band par FM radio steshnon dwaara prasaarit audio signal, lekin + / -25 khz adhiktam aavriti swing ke saath, 75 khz ke vipareet jaisaa ki FM band par upyog kiya jaataa he
 The main audio carrier is 4
5 mhz above the video carrier, making it 250 khz below the top of the channel
 kabhi kabhi ek channel main MTS signal hote he, jo audio signal par ek yaa do sabakarier jodakar ek se zyada audio signal pradaan karata he, jisamen prayek line aavriti ke gunaj ke liye sincranaise hota hai
 This is generally the case when stereo audio and / or other audio program signals are used
 ATSC main samaan ekstansion kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jahaan ATSC digital karier channel ke lower bound ke upar 1
31 megahertz par prasaarit hota he
 Cvbs is a voltage offset between the "black" and "blank" levels
 Cvbs NTSC ke liye adwitiya he
 Cvbs has the advantage of making NTSC video different from its primary synchronization signals and more easily

0 frem prati second par chalane vaali film or NTSC maanak, jo prati second lagbhag 29
97 frames par chalata he, ke madhya fremerat main bada antar he
 Unlike 576i video formats, this difference cannot be easily eliminated by increasing speed
 ek jatil prakriya jise "3:2 puldown" kehete he, kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a film frame is broadcast for three video fields and the next frame is broadcast for two video fields
 isliye do 24 frem / s film fremapanch 60 hertz ke video fields main prasaarit hote hai, ausat maan 21⁄2 video fields prati film frem hai
 The average frame rate is 60 / 2
5 = 24 frames / s, so the average film speed is exactly what it should be
 However, there are drawbacks here
 phir bhi plabac par freming do alag alag film frem se fields ke saath video frem pradarshit kar sakati he, to frem ke bich koi bhi gaman teji se peeche or aage jhilamilaahat ke rup main dikhaai degaa
dhime camera pans ke dauraan dhyaan dene yogya kampan / "khadkhadaahat" ho sakati he
 To avoid a 3: 2 pulldown, film shots are often taken at 30 frames / s, especially for NTSC television
 NTSC upkaran par mul 576i saamagree dekhne ke liye maanak roopantaran hona chahie

 Because satellite power is severely limited, analog video transmission via satellites is different from terrestrial TV broadcasts
 AM ek rekhiy adhimishran vidhi he, to ek demodulatted signal se shor anupaat ko samaan rup se ucch RF SNR kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The SNR of studio quality video is above 50 db, so AM will prohibitively require higher powers and / or larger antennas
 kam shakti hetu RF bandwidth ko badalane ke bajaay wideband FM kaa rayog kiya jaataa he
 Increasing the channel bandwidth from 6 to 36 mhz allows only RF SNR of 10 db or less
 vyapak nois bandwidth is 40 db bijli kii bachatko 32 DB ke ek mahatvapurn net newnikaran ke liye 36 megahertz / 6 megahertz = 8 db tak kam kar detii he
 Sound like terrestrial broadcasting is on the FM subcarrier, but frequencies above 4
5 mhz are used to minimize aural / visual disturbances
 asambandhit audio or data signlles ko atirikt sabakariers par rakhaa ja saktaa he
 a triangular 60 Hz energy distribution waveform is added to the overall baseband signal before modulation
 agar video signal nasht ho jaye to yah upgrah power varnakrameey ghanatv ko simit kar detaa he
 Otherwise the satellite can transmit all its power at the same frequency, interfering with terrestrial microwave links in the same frequency band
 aadhe transponder mod main, samgr besaband signal kii aavriti vichlan 18 megahertz tak kam kar di jaati he jisase 36 megahertz transponder ke duusare bhaag main anya signal ko anumati di ja sake
 yah FM ko laabh kuch had tak kam kar detaa he or pun: praapt kiye gaye snrs ko aage kam kar diya jaataa he kyonki upgrah transponder main anbdhimishran virupan se bachane ke liye sanyukt signal power ko "peeche hataa" dena chahie
 ekal FM signal ek nirantar aayam he, to yah virupan ke bina ek transponder ko tar kar saktaa hai
 An NTSC 'frame' consists of an 'even' field following an 'odd' field
 jahaan tak ek analog signal ke abhigrahan kaa sambandh he, yah vishuddh rup se samjhaute kaa vishay he or isse koi fark nahin padataa he
 In fact it does not matter whether it is a line / space pair or a space / line pair, for a driver the effect is exactly the same
 digital televijan praroopon ke parichay ne tathyon ko kuch badal diya he
 Most digital TV formats, including the popular DVD format, are first moved through recording ntsc-generated video with even field in the recorded frame, with the result that even field often records first in frame If they are constructed, it is necessary that the field order be reversed, otherwise an unacceptable shudder on moving objects
 Omb 'effect as they are shown in a field forward and then jump back to the next
 jahaan gaiyr NTSC pragatisheel video ko antarvayan athwa iske vipareet kram main transcode kiya jaataa he vahaan yah khatra bhi ban gaya he
 Systems that retrieve progressive frames or transcode the video must ensure that the 'field order' is being considered, otherwise the recovered frame will have a field of one field and a field from the adjacent frame, with As a result, 'comb' fusion artifacts will arise
 If an improper de-interlacing algorithm is selected you can often see it in PC based video game facilities
 abhigrahan samasyaayein, color signal kaa phej parivartit karke NTSC pikchar ko kharaab kar sakati hai, taaki tasviir kaa rang santulan tab tak badalata rahegaa jab tak resiver ko kshatipurak na kar diya jaye
 yah NTSC sets par tint niyantran kaa samaveshan aavashyak karata he, jo pal athwa SECAM system par aavashyak nahin he
 Typically compared to PAL, NTSC has significantly lower color accuracy and stability, which causes television engineers and video practitioners to jokingly call Never the Same Color, Never Twice the Same Color or No True Skin Color
 yah rang phej, "tint", yaa "rang" niyantran kala main kushal kisi bhi vyakti ko aasaani se SMPTE color bars ke saath monitor ko vyasamaapan karne kii anumati detaa he, ek aise set ke saath bhi jo uchit rangon ke pradarshan kii anumati dekar apane color pradarshan main bah gaya ho
 The use of NTSC coded color in S-video systems completely eliminates phase distortions
 parinaam swaroop, NTSC rang ankoding kaa upyog jab is yojana ke saath kiya jaataa he to yah teen rang pranali kaa sarvocch sankalp chitra gunvattta pradaan karti he
 Inappropriate matching between 30 frames per second of NTSC and 24 frames per second of film can be corrected by a process that takes advantage of the field rate of interference NTSC signal, thus with some jerkiness in the video at 25 frames per second Can ignore movie playback speedups used for 576i systems
 See framerate conversion above PAL ke vipareet, duniya bhar main iske kai vibhinn antarnihit prasaaran televijan systams upyog main he, NTSC rang ankoding prasaaran pranali m ke saath sthir rup se upyog hoti he, tathaa NTSC-M pradaan karti he
 Only Japan's distinction "NTSC-J" is slightly different: the black level and blank level of the signal are the same in Japan as they are in PAL, while the black level in the US NTSC is slightly higher than the blank level since the difference is quite Is small so it is enough to slightly rotate the brightness knob to correctly show the "other" variation of NTSC on any other set because it is assumed that many viewers will see the difference even in the first Principles can not do
 PAL-M system NTSC ke samaan prasaaran bandwidth, frem rate, linon kii sankhya kaa upyog karata he, parantu PAL color ankoding kaa upyog karata he

 The color-under format of VHS uses a 629 khz subcarrier, while u-matic and Betamax use a 688 khz subcarrier to transmit amplitude-optimized chroma signals for both NTSC and PAL formats
 chunki VCR PAL rang mod or tej raikhik tepe gati kaa upyog karte hue NTSC recording ke rang bhaag ko play karne ke liye taiyaar tha, isliye PAL ke 50 hertz field rate ko NTSC ke 59

 His ancestor Kashinath Bhatt's daughter "poorna" was married to Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya ji
 kashinath ke putr jagannatha ke kramash: gitta, lambuk, jogiya, tighara, giradhan or bharam naamak chah putr hue
 Gorelal was born around the year 1715, in the tenth generation of Nagnath, the son of the same Gitta
 "vrihalrukamaudgalyagotre prathitataraysha nanathanvayebhut"
 According to Bundeladhishpujya: Kavikulatilko Gaurilalakhyo Bhatt: "the ancient scholar Krishnashastri wrote in" Vallabhadigvijay "that" Mudgal Gotriya "was the poet-clan-tilak Gorelal in the dynasty of Nagnath, whom the superintendent of Bundelkhand looked upon with great reverence

 yadhyapi kavi kii mrityu ke bare main kuch bhi gyaat nahin, tathaapi "chatraprakash" main varnit antim ghatana kaa samay san
 1764 vi
 maanakar mishrabandhu or ramchandra shukla aadi ne ukt samay ko hi kavi kaa mrityuka hone kaa galat anumaan lagaaya he jabaki ukt rachana kii uplabdh prati main antim varnit ghatana "lohagarh, vijay" he, jiskaa samay he san
 1767 vi

 Therefore the poet died no
 It is possible to believe only after 1767 AD
 laal kavi kii kai rachanaayen bataayi jaatin hai - "chatraprashasti", "chhatrachhaaya", "chhatrakirti", "chhatrachand", "chhatrasalashatak", "chhatrahajaraa", "chhatradand", "chatraprakash", "rajavinod" barbe aadi
 But the only attainable and important composition of these is Chhatraprakash
 rachanaaon ke naam se hi jaan padataa he ki kavi apane charitnayak ke gunon par itnaa lattu tha ki usne jo kuch or jitna bhi likhaa sab "chhatra" ko hi lekar
 "chhatraprakash" is counted in the unique poetry of Veeras
 isaki rachana maharaj chhatrasaal kii ajna se kii gai thi
 The first publication of "chhatraprakash" was done by Major Price from Fort William College, Calcutta, but that copy is no longer obtainable

 1767 vi
 tak kii bundelkhand sambandhi choti se choti ghatnaon kaa vivaran bhi diya gaya he
 The poet's deep allegiance to the protection of historical truth is visible
 kala or kalpana, jinase ghatnaon kii sachaai kaaphi dhundli or mand pad jaati he, kaa bahut kam prayog hone se "chatraprakash" ke varnan tathy se bhare hue or itivrittatmak ho gaye hai
 Captivated by its historical significance, Captain Pavson did it in English

 They also know the relationship of the story well and the choice of poignant places
 takaar, dakaradi lomaharshak varnon kaa prayog badi hi swaabhaavik paddati par virarsodrek ke liye kiya gaya he
 The poet's vision is not as much towards rasatranas; Even then, the sentiments have got a proper climax
 iske vipareet yudhprasang main thode antar par anek vyaktiyon ke naamon ke ullekh, varnan-vistaar-priyata or itivrittatmakataa aadi ke sanyog ne uski kaavyatmak sarasata ko neeras or feekaa bana diya he

 jowar ek pramukh fasal he
 Jowar is sown for both grain and fodder in low rainfall areas
 jowar jaanwaron kaa mahatvapurn evam paushtik chaara hai
 In India, this crop is sown on about 125 million acres of land
 yah kharif kii mukhya fasalon main he
 It is a type of grass whose grains of Bali are counted in coarse grains
 sinchai karke varsha se pehle evam varsha aarambh hote hi isaki bowai kii jaati he
 If it is sown by irrigating before the rainy season, the crop gets ready more quickly, but when the rainy season is well, then its feed should be fed to the animals
 garmi main isaki fasal main kuch vish paidaa ho jaataa he, isliye barsaat se pehle khilaane se pashuon par vish kaa bada bura prabhaav pad saktaa he
 This poison does not remain in the rain
 chaare ke liye adhik beej lagbhag 12 se 15 ser prati acre boyaa jaataa he
 By sowing it dense, the green fodder remains thin and soft and is cut and fed to cows and bulls
 jo fasal dane ke liye boi jaati he, usamen keval aath ser beej prati acre daalaa jaataa he
 The grain is cooked by the end of October, after the corn has to be cared for a month by its birds
 jab dane pak jate hai tab bhutte alag katkar dane nikaal liye jate hai
 Its average yield varies from six to eight mana per acre
 acchhee fasal main 15 se 20 man prati acre dane kii paidaavaar hoti he
 After extracting the grain, about 100 mana per acre of dry nutritious feed is also produced, which is finely chopped and fed to the animals
 sookhe chaaron main gehun ke bhuse ke baad jowar kaa danthal tathaa pattey hi sabase uttam chaara mana jaataa he
 This grain occurs in many parts of the world
 bharat, china, arab, africa, america aadi main isaki kheti hoti he
 The tide is high in dry places, it may not be as much in the places where there is seed
 bharat main rajasthan, punjab aadi main iskaa byavahaar bahut adhik hota he
 Jowar is very low sown in Bengal, Madras, Burma etc
 yadi boi bhi jaati he to dane achche nahin passage
 Its plant is raised straight 5-6 cubits in the form of a stalk like reeds
 danthal main saat saat aath aath angul par gaanthen hoti hai jinase haath dedh haath lambey talwaar ke aakaar ke pattey donon ore nikalate hai
 At its end, flakes of flower cumin and white grains are formed
 ye dane chote chote hote hai or gehun kii tarah khaane ke kaam main aate hai
 There are many types of sorghum whose plants do not show any special distinction
 jowar kii fasal do prakaar kii hoti he, ek rabi, duusari kharif
 Mecca also has a difference
 isi se kahin kahin makka bhi jowar hi kahalata he
 Jowar is also called Jonhari, Jundi etc
 iske danthal or paudhe ko chaare ke kaam main laate hai or 'chari' kehete hai
 There is a difference of opinion regarding the place of origin of this grain
 koi koi ise arab aadi pashchimi deshon se aayaa hua maanate hai or 'jowar' shabd ko arabi 'duura' se bana hua maanate hai, par yah mat thik nahin jaan padataa
 Jowar cultivation has been in India since very ancient times
 par yah chaare ke liye boi jaati thi, ann ke liye nahin

 The meaning is sometimes derived from 'owner' and 'guide'
 ye shabd farsi yaa pashtun bhashaa kaa he
 It is mainly used for God in Islam and Zoroastrianism
 'khuda' main 'kh' ke uccharan par dhyaan dijiye kyonki yah 'kha' se kaafii bhinn he
 If it is pronounced with the sound of 'b' it is heard 'khuda' which can cause confusion with the action of 'digging'
 khuda ko urdu, farsi or pashto main خدا likhaa jaataa he
 It is originally derived from the word 'khwadh' or 'khwadhta' in the Eastern Iranian language called ancient Avastai, meaning 'owner' or 'self-defining'
 kyonki sanskrit or farsi donon hind-irani bhashaa parivaar kii bahan bhashaayen hai isliye iskaa ek sajaateey shabd 'swaadh' sanskrit main bhi maujuud he
 Another form of this is also found in another Sanskrit word 'huta', which is also found in the current Hindi language as 'ahuti'
 khuda shabd kaa bhartiya upmahadweep kii lok-samskruti main vistrut prayog hota rahaa he: Originally in North India, it was not considered to be related to any religion and people from every community used this word openly
 pakistan main zia-ul-haq kii kattarwadi nitiyon ke laghu hone ke baad vahaan is dharm-asambandhit shabd kaa prayog kam kar ke 'allaah' shabd kaa prayog zyaada karne par jor diya gaya
 For this reason, 'allah Hafiz' is often spoken in Pakistan instead of 'god Hafiz'
 bharat, afghanistan or iran main abhi bhi 'khuda haafiz' hi prachlit he, jiskaa kisi dharm se koi gaharaa sambandh nahin

 Non-living organism or non-living organism is an organism that does not require oxygen to grow
 kuch avayujeev to oxigen kii maatr upasthiti se hi kshatigrast ho jate hai yaa mar jate hai
 In contrast, oxygen is essential for pneumatic organisms

 Anaerobic organisms are generally divided into three categories: lagbhag aadhi shatabdi kii uthapatak tathaa shaq shaskaon ke haathon manamardan ke baad gautami putr shri shatakarni ke netritv main apni khoi hui pratishtha ko purnsthapit kar liya
 Gautami's son Sri Shatkarni was the greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, who ruled for nearly 25 years, not only restored the lost prestige of his empire but also established a vast empire
 gautami putr ke samay tathaa uski vijayon ke baaren main hamen uski mata gautami balashri ke nasik shilalekhon se sampoorn jaankaree milti he
 With reference to him, we get information from this article that he had repented the ego of the Kshatriyas
 uskaa varnan shaq, yavan tathaa pehlaav shaskao ke vinaash karta ke rup main hua he
 His greatest achievement was the defeat of Shaka ruler Nahapan of the Kshatra dynasty and his descendants at his hands
 jogalthambi samuh se praapt nahpaan ke chandi ke sikken jinhe ki gautami putr shatakarni ne dubaara dhalvaaya tathaa apane shashan kaal ke atharahawein varsh main gautami putr dwaara nasik ke nikat pandu-len main guhaadaan karnaa- ye kuch aise tathy he jon yah pramanit karaten he ki usne shaq shaskaon dwaara chhine gaye pradeshon ko purnvijit kar liya
 His war with Nahapan took place in the 17th and 18th years of his reign, and after winning this war, the son of Gagatami abducted, Anoop, Saurashtra, Kukar, Akar and Avanti from being drunk
 in kshetron ke atirikt gautami putr kaa rishik, ayamak, mulak tathaa vidarbha aadi pradeshon par bhi adhipaty tha
 The area under its direct influence extended from Malwa and Kathiawar in the north to the Krishna River in the south and from Berar in Puwa to Konkan in the west

 It seems that shortly before his death, the territories won by Gautami's son Shatkarni defeated Nahapan and passed away
 gautami putr se in pradeshon ko chhinane vaale sambhawatah sithian jati ke hi karadaamak vansh ke shaq shaasha the
 We find evidence of this by Talmi from his book describing geography
 aisa hi nishkarsh 150 i0 ke prasiddh rudradaman ke junagarh ke shilaalekh se bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 This inscription shows that Rudradaman captured all the territories of Gautamiputra Shatkarni, who had been conquered by Nahapan
 aisa prathit hota he ki gautamiputra shatakarni ne karadaamak shakon se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar rudradaman dwaara hathiyaae gaye apane kshetron ko surakshit karne kaa prayaas kiya

png Surabhedi language is a language in which the meaning of words and sentences changes depending on the change in tone of voice
 chini bhashaa vishwa kii sab se adhik logon dwaara boli jane vaali surabhedi bhashaa he
 In India, the Western Pahari languages like Punjabi and Dogri are Surabhedi
 kuch had tak har bhashaa main suron ke zariye bhaawanaaon ko prakat kiya jaataa he lekin ek hi varnon vaale shabdon kaa arth suron ke saath keval surabhedi bhashaaon main badalata he
 Surabhedi languages are called "tonal languages" in English
 chini main "maa" shabd kaa arth sur ke badlaav par nirbhar karata he - If the change of notes is shown with arrows, a line of sugar can be as follows - agar kisi ko surabhedi bhashaaon kii aadat na ho to use is pankti main sirf "mamaa maa maa de maa maa" kaa abhas hoga
 He will feel that the same "ma" word is being repeated over and over, while five different words are actually being said here due to different notes
 isi tarah punjabi main bhi suron kaa prayog hota he - Keep in mind that they are written differently in both Punjabi scripts, but they are pronounced alike
 punjabi main puchha ja saktaa he "kodaa, kodaa ke kodaa?" - agar inke sur alag-alag thik se bole jaaen to punjabi maatrubhaashiyon ko iskaa arth "ghoda, chaabuk, yaa kadava?" samaj aa jayega jabaki sambhav he ke gair-punjabiyon ko lage ke ek hi shabd teen dafaa kaha gaya he
