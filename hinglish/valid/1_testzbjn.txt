 Rather, after a controversy, it was concluded that Babur's diamond was later called Kohinoor
 babar evam humayu, donon ne hi apni aatmakathaaon main, babar ke heere ke udgam ke bare main likhaa he
 This diamond was earlier with the Kachwaha rulers of Gwalior, from whom it reached the Tomar kings
 antim tomars vikramaditya ko sikandar lodhi ne haraaya, va apane adheen kiya, tathaa apane saath dilli main hi bandi bana kar rakhaa
 After Lodhi was defeated by the Mughals, the Mughals plundered his property, but Prince Humayun meddled and got his property back, but instead liberated him and took refuge in Mewar, Chittor
 humayu kii is bhalaai ke badale vikramaditya ne apana ek bahumoolya hira, jo shaayad kohinoor hi tha, humayu ko saabhaar de diya
 But Humayun's life was very unfortunate
 vah shershah suri se haar gaya
 Suri also died by burning with a cannonball
 uskaa putr va uttaradhikari jalaal khan apane saale dwaara hatya ko praapt hua
 That brother-in-law was also overthrown by one of his ministers
 vah mantri bhi ek yuddh ko jitate jitate aankh main chot lag jane ke kaaran haar gaya, va sltanat kho baitha
 Humayun's son Akbar never kept this gem with him, which later went directly to Shah Jahan's treasury
 shahjahan bhi apane bete aurangzeb dwaara takhtapalat kar bandi banaaya gaya, jisane apane anya teen bhaaiyon kii hatya bhi kii thi
 Shah Jahan rooted Kohinoor in his famous Peacock-throne
 uske putr aurangzeb ne apane pita ko kaid karke agra ke kile main rakhaa
 It is also a legend that he placed the Kohinoor near the window in such a way that, inside it, Shah Jahan could see the image of the Taj Mahal
 kohinoormugalo ke paas 1739 main hue irani shaasha nadir shah ke akraman tak hi rahaa
 He looted fiercely in Agra and Delhi
 vah mayur singhaasana sahit kohinoor va agaadh sampatti faras lut kar le gaya
 On receiving this diamond, Nadir suddenly left the face of Shah: koh-i-noor, from which it got its current name
 1739 se purv, is naam kaa koi bhi sandarbh gyaat nahin he
 Kohinoor's assessment comes from a legend by Nadir Shah
 uski rani ne kaha tha, ki yadi koi shaktishaalee maanav, paanch pattharon ko chaaron dishaao, va upar kii ore, puri shakti sahit phenke, to unke bich kaa khaali sthaan, yadi suvarna va ratnon maatr se hi bharaa jaye, unke baraabar isaki keemat hogi
 In 1747, after the assassination of Nadir Shah, it passed into the hands of Ahmed Shah Abdali of Afghanistan

 In its replacement, Ranjit Singh had prepared the East India Company to send its troops to Afghanistan, win the Afghan throne and bring back Shah Shuja
 ranjit singh, ne swayan ko punjab kaa maharaja ghoshit kiya tha
 In 1839, on his death bed, he wrote to Kohinoor to donate to Puri, Odisha famous Sri Jagannath, temple

 On March 29, 1849, hoisted the British flag at the Lahore Fort
 is tarah punjab, british bharat kaa bhaag ghoshit hua
 An important part of the Treaty of Lahore was as follows: "the jewel named koh-i-noor, taken from Maharaja Ranjit Singh from shah-shuja-ul-mulk, will be handed over to the Queen of England by the Maharaja of Lahore
 " The Governor General was in charge of this treaty, Lord Dalhousie, whose desire to acquire the Kohinoor was one of the main reasons for this treaty
 inke bharat main kaary, sadaa hi vivaad grast rahe, va kohinur arjan kaa krity, bahut se british tikaakaron dwaara, aalochit kiya gaya he
 However, some even proposed that diamonds should have been presented directly to the Queen, rather than being snatched away; But Dalhazi considered it a reward for war, and saved it in the same way
 baad main, dalhauzi ne, 1851 main, maharaja ranjit singh ke uttaradhikari dalip singh dwaara maharani victoria ko bhent kiye jane ke prabandh kiye
 Thirteen years old, Dalip traveled to England, and met him

 In 1852, in the presence of Victoria's husband Prince Albert, the diamond was cut again, reducing it from 186 1 / 6 carats to 105
602 carats, but its aura increased manifold
 albert ne budhimata kaa parichay dete hue, acchhee salahon ke saath, is kaary main apana ativ prayaas lagaaya, saath hi tatkaaleen 8000 pound bhi, jisase is ratna kaa bhaar 42% ghat gaya, parantu albert phir bhi asantusht the

 The story of 'kohinoor', the world's rarest and most prized diamond, reaching the crown of the Queen of Britain extends from the Kurukshetra of Mahabharata to the poor laborer's hut of Golconda
 britain kii maharani ke taj main jadaa or duniya ke anek baadshahon ke dilon ko lalachaane kii kshamta rakhane vaala anokhaa kohinoor duniya main aakhir kahan se aayaa, is bare main aitihaasik ghatnaon ke alaava bahut si kathaayen or kinvadantiyaan bhi prachlit hai

 Aspavarman did the work of satrap during the reign of both Ayas II and Gudufar and Sas did the work of satrap during the reign of Gudufar and his successor Pacoriz
 is vansh main sabase pehla rajuvul athwa ranjuvul tha jisane sambhavat pehle sakal par bhi rajya kiya tha
 Stancono estimated that lineage as follows: rajuvul kaa naam abhilekhon tathaa mudraon main praapt hota he
 In the Mora Krupa inscription he is called Mahakshatrap
 kintu uski mudraon par praapt lekh main use rajaadhiraj kaha gaya he
 Razuvul was succeeded by Shudas
 abhilekhon main bhi use mahakshatrap kaha gaya he
 Some scholars consider the years given in their inscriptions and some in Vikram Samvat

 Kharoshta, according to Kono, according to Rajuvul's breath and palette, was double-headed
 ek anya mudra par kharoshtee lipi main ‘kshatrapas prakhar ostas artsputras’ likhaa hua miltaa he
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the origin of these satraps
 kabhi unhen palhaav, kabhi shaq desh se aayaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 Probably they were suspicious

 These satrapes appear to be of two lineages
 pehla vansh bhumak or nahpaan kaa tha tathaa doosraa chashton kaa
 On the obverse of the coins of Bhumak, the symbol of arrow, chakra and thunderbolt and the Brahmi and Kharoshthi on the back part, with the inscription 'kshrahat Kshatrap Bhumak', along with the head of Dharma Chakra are found
 bhumak ke uttaradhikari nahpaan kaa pataa uski rajat evam tamramudraon se hi nahin varan uske damaad ushavadaat ke abhilekhon se bhi lagaaya jaataa he
 Nahapan also ruled over some part of Western India
 nahpaan ne pashchimi bharat ke kuch bhaag par bhi rajya kiya tha
 It is known from Periplus that the capital of Nahapan was Meennagar
 usne satvaahan ke samrajya kaa kuch bhaag bhi jeet liya tha

 ujjain main shashan karne vaale dwitiya vansh ke kshatrapon main kardamakavansheey chashton ke pita yasmotik kaa naam sarvapratham aata he
 Chashthan's son Jayadaman was a Kshatrap but he probably died during his father's lifetime and Ujjain was ruled by Chasthan and Rudradamana together
 junagarh abhilekh main mahakshatrap rudradaaman ke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki usne mahakshatrap kii oopaadhi arjeet kii thi
 It seems that the king of his dynasty was probably taken away by Gautamiputra Satakarni and Rudradamon had to earn the title of Mahakshatrap by winning those territories again
 junagarh abhilekh main uski vijayon tathaa uske vyaktitv kii prashasti he
 Rudradaman i was succeeded by his eldest son Damaghasad

 What was the relationship between Bhartradaman and Vishwasingh with Mahakshatrap Rudradaman II
 yah nishchaypurvak nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The last satrap of this dynasty was Rudrasingh III who ruled till about 388 AD

 According to Brunstedt and Lowry, alkali is a substance that donates OH- to acidic substances
 ksharak vastav main ve padaarth hai jo amla ke saath milakar lavan or jal banaate hai
 For example, zinc oxide combines with sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and water

 The bases contain oxides and hydroxides of metals, but for convenience some groups of elements are also formed which combine with acids to form salts without water

 Oxides of alkali metals quickly dissolve in water
 kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main kam viley hote hai or kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main zaraa bhi viley nahin hai
 Some nonmetal hydrides, such as hydrides of nitrogen and phosphorus are also consumed

 rawal ratnasingh chittod ke shaasha the
 His reign was short-lived
 bappa rawal ke vansh main samar singh ke do putron main ratnasingh ek yogya parakramee shaasha tha, ratna singh ke bhai kumbhakarna pehle se hi mewar ko chhodkar nepal palaayan kar gaye, is kaaran ratan singh shaasha bane jo rawal shakha ke antim shaasha the | Seated on the throne of Chittor in the very early years of the fourteenth century
 inaki vishesh khyaati hindi ke mahakavy padmavat main raja ratansen ke naam se rahi he
 Some historians believe his ascension in 1301 AD and some in 1302 AD
 inaki patni itihaas-prasiddh rani padmini yaa padmavati thi
 These were destroyed along with the family and the government in 1303 AD by the invasion of Alauddin Khilji
 praayah 1 varsh kaa hi shashan kaal hone tathaa inke saath hi inke vansh kaa ant ho jane se pashchaatkaaleen bhaaton-chaarnon kii gaathaon main inkaa naam hi lupt ho gaya tha
 Even being based mainly on these sources, they have not even been named in Colonel Tod's famous Rajasthani treatise
 unke sthaan par atyant bhraamak rup se bhimsingh se inaki patni rani padmini kaa sambandh joda gaya he
 Renowned historian Mahamahopadhyay Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha proved the historicity of Rawal Ratnasinh while clarifying Colonel Tod's mistake
 ojha ji ne sari bhrantiyaan tathaa sachai spasht karte hue likhaa he ki "rawal summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh chittod kii gaddi par baitha
 It was only a few months before he ruled, so Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khilji attacked Chittor and after fighting for more than six months, he took the fort
 mewar ke kuch khyaton, rajprashasti, mahakavy or karnal tod ke rajasthan main to ratnasingh kaa naam tak nahin diya
 Karan Singh is written to be the king after Samarsingh, but Karansingh is not after Samarsingh, but it was 8 generations before that
 muhanot nanasi apni khyath main likhata he ki ratansi padmani ke maamle main allaudin se ladakar kaam aayaa; parantu vah ratnasingh ko ek jagah to samarsi kaa putr or duusari jagah ajaisi kaa putr or bhadlakhamasi kaa bhai batalaata he, jisamen se pichhlaa kathan vishwaas-yogya nahin he, kyonki lakhamasi ajaisi kaa putr nahin kintu pita or sisode kaa sardaar tha
 Thus Ratnasinh was not the brother of Lakhmsi but the lord of Mewar and the son of Samarsingh, as found in the inscription and Ekalingamahatmya of Kumbhalgarh dated 1517, around the time of Rana Kumbhakarna
 in donon main yah bhi likhaa he ki summersingh ke peeche uskaa putr ratnasingh raja hua
 When he was killed, Lakshman Singh was killed, along with his seven sons, by destroying the Mlechchas for the protection of Chittor
 " No details are available regarding Ratnasinh more than the ancient inscriptions etc
 allaudin khilji ke akraman se sambaddh vivaran amir khusro ke 'tarikhe alaai' main miltaa he
 The above book by Amir Khusro shows that Sultan Alauddin Khilji left Delhi to take Chittor on 28 January 1303 AD and the fort was conquered on 26 August 1303 AD
 allaudin khilji ke akraman ke sambandh main mahakavi malik mohammad jaaysi ne apane suprasiddh mahakavy padmavat main likhaa he ki yah akraman raja ratansen kii adwitiya sundari patni padmavati ko praapt karne ke liye hua tha or anek varshon tak gheraa daalane ke baad asafal hokar khilji laut gaya tha tathaa dubaara akraman karke vijayi hua tha
 But now with the historical facts coming out, historians have started to believe that the main reason for the invasion was the imperial ambition of Alauddin and the military and commercial utility of Chittor
 gujarat, malwa, madhya pradesh, sanyukt praant, sindh aadi bhaagon ke vyapaarik maarg chittod se hokar guzarate the
 It is natural that an ambitious Sultan like Alauddin Khilji would like to authorize it
 yah sambhav he ki padmini kii sundarataa jaanakar uskaa ek uddeshy use praapt karnaa bhi ho gaya ho
 Whatever be the reason, but Alauddin's invasion destroyed the life of Rawal Ratnasinh along with the rule and Rani Padmini, along with her majority friends and other queens, became Sati by doing Jauhar

 In this peace deal, the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front asked for a certain degree of territorial autonomy in the Tamil areas, along with controlling the territorial council, and asking the Tamil militant groups to lay down their weapons
 a part of the Indian Army was to be sent to Sri Lanka which implemented disarmament and supervised the regional council

 Instead, it stated that regional autonomy could meet their demands
