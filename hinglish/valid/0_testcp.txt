 Lalu had said earlier in the day on Friday that opposition parties were still following the same path that Nitish Kumar had suggested to make the country 'union free'
 unhone nai dilli se patna pahunchane par hawaondde par samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'pataa nahin kis vajah se nitish kumaar alag chale gayi or aresas ke aadmi ko samarthan de diya
 "when Lalu was asked in the evening if he spoke with Nitish Kumar, he said," This is not an opportunity to speak on such topics
 '' bhakpa netaa es sudhakar reddy ne kaha, ''hamane gopal krishna gandhi kaa naam sujhaayaa tha lekin bhaajapa ne ek baar phir baithak kii baat kahi thi
 But he declared Ramnath Kovind's name without consulting us
 '' jab poocha gaya ki vipaksh ne gopal krishna gandhi ko ummidavaar kyon nahin banaaya to reddy ne kaha, ''hamane gandhi kaa naam keval sujhaayaa tha
 If the BJP had agreed to it, we would have supported them
 '' vam dalon ke sutron ke anusaar yah bhi hairaani kii baat he ki guuruuvaar ko jab dilli main sanyukt ummidavaar ke naam par faisla karne ke liye vipaksh kii baithak hui to unke sujhaaye naamon par vichaar tak nahin hua
 According to sources, JDU, which advocates for opposition unity first and later supported Kovind's candidate, was also of the opinion that a non-congress candidate would have been better
 sutron ne kaha ki congress ummidavaar khadaa karnaa jadyu ko vipakshi kheme main waapas laane ke raste main kathinaayee vaala sabit ho saktaa he, bhale hi mira kumaar bihar se taalluk rakhti hai
 Sources said, 'there is a feeling that there should be a non-congress candidate
 ''tippaniyan Nitish said that whatever the decision is, the decision has been taken very thoughtfully and there is a very clear concept behind it
 ham ye maanate hai or jaisaa ki jab unke naam kii ghoshnaa kii gai, or jab main mananeey shri ramnath kovind ji se milakar lautaa tha to maine us samay jo baat kahi thi, uske pehle hi meri lalu ji se or sonia gandhi baat hui thi

 He worked with impartiality in Bihar
 or bihar ke rajyapal sidhe raashtrapati banane ja rahe hai, yah bhi ek prasannataa kii baat he

 After that it was decided after considering inside the party that this presidential election is being held

 We could have said this in our meeting of opposition parties
 lekin uske ek din pehle congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad patna aae or unhone apni baat itane spasht rup se kahi ki isapar vichaar hi nahin karnaa he, tab yah munasib hi nahin laga ki us baithak main jaakar or is par anaavashyak charchaa kii jaae
 Because when the mind was already told, while on the first day i had expressed my feeling, it was felt that we would sit and talk
 baithkar agar khule man se baatcheet karte to humlog usamen yah baat rakhte ki raashtrapati ke chunaav ko is prakaar se virodh kaa mudda banane kaa koi aavashyaktaa nahin he

 desh ke sabase bade aspataal ames ke resident doctors in dinon aspataal ke campus main gum rahe aawaara kutton or bandaron se behad aatankit hai
 The fear of dogs is such that doctors bite them on the go, even patients are upset with stray dogs
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki kutton ke saath-saath campus main bandaron kaa jabardast aatank he
 This is the fear that Dr
 Vijay, President of Kimske Resident Doctors Association has given even a written complaint to the Director of the Institute
 apni shikaayat main doctoron ne kaha he ki aspataal se lekar hostel tak aawaara kutton or bandaron ne bura haal kiya hua he
 These people take away the food and drink from the hands of people on the go, and at the same time bite them on stopping
 campus main dog or manki bite ke anginat cese ho chuke hai
 The patient and his family are more upset with him
 marijon ko to ye aasaan shikaar samaj kar manamaani karte hi hai, marijon ke parijanon ko bhi kaat lete hai
 Despite all the complaints, no action has been taken so far in the issue
 marij to zyaadaatar maamalon kii shikaayat bhi nahin kar pate kyonki wo pehle hi itane pareshaan hote hai
 By writing a letter, the doctors have asked that if patients die due to their bite, then who will be responsible for it? Monkeys, dogs or doctors? The doctors also tried to resolve the matter by meeting Maneka Gandhi but due to poor health, she could not meet the Union Minister

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye maharashtra kii 17 siton par chauthe charan kii voting ke saath hi sabhi siton par voting aaj samaapt ho jaaegi
 Voting has been completed for the remaining 31 seats in the first three phases
 is tarah se rajya kii sabhi 48 siton par aaj chunaav khatm ho jayega
 In the political battle of Maharashtra, bjp-shiv Sena and congress-ncp are considered a direct fight between the two alliances
 narendra modi or rahul gandhi apane king banane ke liye siyaasi jang lard rahe hai
 At the same time, Chhatrap like Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP president Sharad Pawar are busy in the exercise of becoming kingmakers
 iske saath hi saath is chunaav main saathi dal saath rahete hue apane saathi se aage nikalne kii koshish main hai
 While the NCP is trying to get ahead of the Congress, the Shiv Sena is trying to win more seats than the BJP
 aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar sabhi dal is loksabhaa chunaav main adhik se adhik siten jeetne kii koshish main hai
 It is believed that the number of seats which will be more in the Lok Sabha elections, its claim in the upcoming assembly elections will be as strong
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ne congress-ensipi kaa puri tarah se safaya kar diya tha
 BJP managed to win 23 and Shiv Sena 18 seats
 jabaki congress ko 2, ensipi ko 4 or swabhimaan paksh ko 1 seat mili thi
 However, in the changed political equation this time, the political battle of Maharashtra is quite interesting
 maharashtra main congress-ensipi gathbandhan ke tahat congress 25, ensipi 22 or ek seat par swabhimaan paksh chunaav lard rahi hai
 At the same time, under the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance, BJP has contested in 25 seats and Shiv Sena in 23 seats
 sharad pavaar bhale hi is baar chunaav maidan main khud na lard rahe hon, lekin jis tarah se front foot par aakar khel rahe hai
 Pawar is getting full support of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in this political game
 yahi vajah he ki congress-ensipi gathbandhan ne narendra modi or amit shah ke saath-saath shivasena ke liye kadi chunauti pesh kar rahe hai
 Pawar is fully in the process of becoming a kingmaker
 yahi vajah he ki modi lahar main ensipi ke maharashtra main khiske hue janaadhar ko waapas laane kii kavayad main sharad pavaar jute hue hai
 Pawar and Raj Thackeray's closeness is well known
 raaj thakare pehle congress-ensipi gathbandhan kaa hissaa banane kii khwaahish jaahir kii thi
 But later, as part of the changed strategy, Raj Thackeray is campaigning in favor of congress-ncp without fielding any candidate for any seat
 bhartiya raajnneeti main pehali baar kisi chunaav main netaaon ke bhaashan ke saath power point video pregentation takanic kaa istemaal raaj thakare ne apni jansabhaon main kar rahe hai
 Raj Thackeray caught everyone's attention
 jansabhaon main umadi bheed ne sattadhari bijepi or shivasena gathbandhan ko chintaa main daal diya he
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is busy fighting Maharashtra's war with the help of BJP
 shivasena is baar chunaav main 23 siton par chunaav maidan main utarkar kingmekar banane kii jugat main he
 While BJP is contesting 25 seats to become King
 paanch saal tak bijepi or shivasena ek duusare ke taang khinchate rahe hai, isse donon ko pareshaani khadi ho rahi hai
 However, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance is in power in the state and both parties seem to benefit from it
 vidhansabha main vipaksh ke congress netaa radhakrishna vikhe patil ke bete ko bijepi main shaamil karakar congress ke manobal ko todane kii kavayad kii he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis are leading the election campaign in the state continuously
 modi ne baaki duusare rajyon se zyada maharashtra main reliyon ko sambodhit kiya he
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is also campaigning fiercely and trying to retain his won seats
 maharashtra ke bhima koregaanv main hui hinsa ke baad rajya main daliton kii naaraazgi kaa phayda uthaane kii jugat main congress-ensipi thi
 But Prakash Ambedkar's party in alliance with Asauddin Owaisi's AIMIM increased the beating of congress-ncp
 ye gathbandhan kareeb dhai darjan siton par apane ummidavaar utaare hai
 According to political analysts, this alliance can create problems for the congress-ncp, while the bjp-shiv Sena can make the path of alliance easier

 Excerpts from the conversation with Kaushik Deka: As some parties and leaders have demanded, will NRC be implemented at the national level? We have not yet reached the point that we can talk of implementing NRC at the national level
 
 pehle ham ise assam main to puraa kar len
 What would you say about the people who were left out of the finalized NRC? There is no policy in India for such people who have no country
 ek baar antim enarasi aa jane par usase baahar rah gaye logon ko ve visheshadhikaar nahin mil paaenge jinke hakdaar asli bhartiya naagarik hai
 After that these people can take the legal route through the tribunal, High Court and Supreme Court of foreigners
 agar adaalatein kisi shaks ko bhartiya naagarik ghoshit kar detii hai, to use apane haq waapas mil jaaenge
 The assumption is that the BJP wants to give citizenship to illegal Hindu migrants from Bangladesh
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak 2016 ke peeche yahi manshaa kaam kar rahi he?main is par kuch nahin kah saktaa kyonki vidheyak sansad main lambit he
 But in the Rajya Sabha, you said that Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh were victims of religious persecution and that the people of six religious groups who came to India before 31 December 2014 - Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Jain and Christian - are not illegal migrants
 aisa nahin he
 It is not illegal for them to stay here
 magar yahaan rahane se ve bhartiya naagarik nahin ban jate
 They have to prove themselves to be victims of religious persecution in order to make their stay here legal
 yahi niti rohingya musalamaanon par lagu kyon nahin kii jaati?hamane kuch nishchit samoohon ko sharnaarthi kaa darja diya he kyonki in logon ko apni janmabhumi se jabaran bedakhal kar diya gaya he yaa unhone apni paidaaish ke desh main dharmik utpeeda saha he
 Rohingyas do not fall into this category
 ve gaiyrkanoonee taur par bharat main daakhil hue hai
 What stringent law will be made against the incidents of beatings? a committee of four members will examine whether a separate law is needed to beaten up or curb violence at the hands of the mob? We have sent guidelines to coordinate with the social media providers to the states to prevent rumors and fake news
 aresas apane ek aayojan main rahul gandhi ko bulaane vaala he
 What is your message for them? Congress is the most intolerant party

 The Maharashtra Police has arrested members of a faction of Hindutva in connection with a terrorist conspiracy

 is letters main daawa kiya gaya ki indiabulls houseing finance jaanboojh kar vittiya patan or diwaliyapan kii taraf bad rahi he, jo real estate, banking, share bazaar aadi main bhrashtachar kaa masalaa he
 In this, investors worth Rs 1 lakh crore and the National Housing Finance Board are engaged
 subramanyam swami ke mutabik indiabulls ne 100 se adhik shell companiyaan banaai, jinhone NHB se karj liya
 The loan was then passed on to several real estate companies in Maharashtra, Delhi, Gurugram, Bangalore and Chennai

 In such a situation, it is important that by recognizing these symptoms, the person should meet the doctor without delay and get it treated

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray has said that Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj is the only leader in the ally BJP who is eligible to become Prime Minister
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main prakashit saakshaatkaar ke tisare hisse main thakare ne kaha ki philhal ek hi shaks he, jo budhimaan or pratibhashali hai-vah hai sushamaa swaraj
 He said these things in response to the question in which he was asked who could become the next Prime Minister from the BJP

 If there was no top light, then why did the train come out of the yard? On the questions being raised about organizing the program near the railway line, Sidhu claimed that the police were asked to organize the program within the boundary wall of a campus near the tracks
 Permission was sought

 bhartiya janata party kii is aapatti par ki chunaav prakriya jari hone ke bich bank license jari kiye ja rahe hai rajan ne kaha, 'yah (bank license dena) kisi bhi lihaaj se raajnneetik prakriya nahin he
 It is an economic and regulatory process and should be treated separately
 
 
 hamen jo karnaa he vah hamen karnaa he
 ' unhone kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki jo bhi vichaar vyakt kiye jate hai, harek ko uskaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 The work of issuing new bank licenses was started in 2011
 prakriya puri hote hote chunaav kaa samay aa gaya
 It took too much time to examine the applications received for bank licenses
 rajan ne kaha is niamkeey prakriya ko puraa kiya janaa he
 He said that this process is going on at its own pace
 yah niamkeey prakriya he
 This is not a government process and the assumption behind seeking permission from the Election Commission was that there should not be any controversy behind whoever is given a license in this election season
 chunaav ayog ne nae bank license jari karne ke rigerv bank ke aagrah par abhi koi nirnay nahin kiya he
 The Reserve Bank has received 25 applications for obtaining new bank licenses
 5 march ko loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa hone ke saath hi adarsh chunaav aachaar samhita lagu ho gai

 According to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, about three months ago, an attempt was made to gather information about the army's telephone numbers from a phone from Pakistan at the BSNL office
 jaisalmer doorsanchaar nigam ke jila prabandhak yogesh bhaskar ne bataaya ki kareeb teen maah pehle falsund kshetra main sainya abhyaas ke dauraan sena ne asthai telephone conection liye the
 The comments isamen ek number kii kol detail jaanane ke liye dilli ke number se phone aayaa tha or sambandhit karmchaaree ne kol detail de di
 Later the security agencies got a clue of this, then it came to know that the phone came from Pakistan and not from Delhi
 unhone bataaya ki beasenel jaisalmer ke account section main karyrat javerilaal ke paas aae phone main sena ke ek conection kaa bill adhik aane ke bare main jaankaree maangi gai
 Javerilal gave all the calls of that number to the person on the phone

 ‘main number game main yakeen nahin karata
 i am not involved in this race
 main har role main apana handred percent detaa hum or phir baaki janata par chhod detaa hum
 i am not a part of the rat race
 ’ akasar film star aise statement dete hai
 Some of them know that they are superstars, but still try to be polite
 kuch super to kya star bhi nahin hai, phir bhi is tarah ke statement dete hai, taaki log samajhen ki star kii tarah bolta he, lagata he star ban gaya he
 Whatever be the status and motive, the rat race continues through these statements
 magar ye filmi duniya kii baat he
 If we talk about politics, here it is not a rat race, but a battle of power, where numbers matter, always
 magar khud ko satta kii sabase badi or vaid daavedaar sabit karne main juty bijepi kii andruni uthapatak is sach ko bhul gai he
 Whatever is happening on his platform, it looks like a rat race
 aise main filmi trick yahaan bhi aajamaai ja rahi hai
 The superstar, who considers himself a contender for number one, is trying to appear humble, the Tutpunji actor is also doing something
 bijepi kaa jahaaj abhi satta ke kinare laga nahin he
 He hopes because a large section feels that he has found a captain under Modi's leadership who understands the wind's stance
 vah jahaaj ko raftaar degaa or us par savaar logon ko saath rakhega
 This idea is more pleasing to Modi than large sections
 unhen lagata he ki is jahaaj or iske kinare pahunchane par milane vaale kinare par swaabhaavik haq unka he
 His supporters are also dreaming of winning the mantra of Namo Namo
 tabhi is kirthan main ek bujurg kaa aalaap khalal daal detaa he
 As soon as Advani said that Modi is not the number one CM, there was a panic on the ship
 matlab nikaale jane lage ki ve shivaraj ke sir taj sajte dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Then came the party president Rajnath and said that Modi ji is the number one CM
 unhone ye bhi chippi chipka di ki ve party ke sabase popular netaa hai
 It also said that Advani's statement was misunderstood
 haalanki samajhane ke liye adwani aage nahin aae ki unke bayaan ko kisne galat samajha, logon ne yaa unki hi party ke netaaon ne
 Amidst these statements, Shivraj Chauhan takes the entry like a true superstar and politely says that i am not number one or even number two
 main to number teen par hum
 Narendra Modi and Raman Singh are my seniors in the party
 bayanon ke is brake ke baad kuch shanti se chal rahe jahaaj par phir bhagdad machi
 The discussion then started as to who should be the captain
 modi is gumaan main hai, hindutv auki vikaas ke maseehaa ban ubharne ke baad gaddi par haq bas unka he
 There is Advani in front of him, who has been bored for a long time playing the responsibility of PM in waiting, has become restless
 unhen lag rahaa he ki bijepi ke netritv main satta mili, to abhi bhi unki vatting kaa inaam liya ja saktaa he
 The question is about licking the syrup of power, but the real question is that nobody has noticed where the power has got, which has already started scolding on the banter
 or adwani jaise dhurandhar bhi is sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke bajaay chaashni par kiskaa haq auki kiskaa nahin, isaki naaptul main lage hai
 Started with a rat
 chuha, jo bhagwaan ganesh kii sawari he
 We worship a rat in idols and temples, but in real life we run with a broom as soon as we see it
 chuhon ko lekar or bhi duniyaadaari hai
 For example, when the ship is about to sink, first the rats jump out of it
 kai baar chuuhe kaalpanik satta ke sammohani sangeet par jhum bhi girane marane lagate hai
 Despite these truths, nobody in the BJP is focused on saving their ship
 har koi apane staradam main jhum rahaa he
 No one considers himself to be a mouse, yet is involved in the race and is seen making statements upon statements, looking left and right
 inke myne bhi maheen hai
 Every yes means no and no means yes
 or party kaa durbhaagya yah ki yah res satta ke tat par lag jane ke baad shuru nahin hui
 It started on the ship itself
 iske chalate jahaaj he ki khatarnaak dhang se hilne laga he
 Everyone has forgotten that there is darkness of struggle before the light of power
 or ise paar paane ke liye aapas kaa saath chahie, varna kinare kaa suraj kinare hi dub jayega or jahaaj bina kinare pahunche

 congress ne rajasthan main bhaajapa sarkaar dwaara rajeev gandhi seva kendron kaa naam badalakar atal seva kendra rakhe jane kii tikhi aalochana kii he
 Along with this, State Congress Committee President Sachin Pilot termed the Rajasthan Panchayat Raj (second Amendment) Ordinance-2014 against the motive of establishing Panchayati Raj Institutions by the BJP government led by Vasundhara Raje
 payalat ne aaj yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki is adhyadesh ke madhyam se jila parishad evam panchayat samiti sadsy kaa chunaav ladne vaale pratyaashiyon ke liye shaikshanik anivaaryta 10veen kaksha uteern hona tathaa sarpanch kaa chunaav ladane vaale pratyaashiyon ke liye 8veen kaksha paas hona anivaary kiya gaya he
 He alleged that the ordinance is about to increase discrimination
 unhone daawa kiya ki sarkaar kii ore se ise panchayat raaj chunaav ke thik pehle lagu kiya janaa pratyaashiyon va rajnatik partiyon va janata ke hit main nahin he
 He cited the census-2011 data as saying that the literacy rate of Rajasthan state is lower than the national literacy rate (the national literacy rate is 74 percent, of which Rajasthan's literacy rate is just 66 percent)
 unhone daawa kiya ki is adhyadesh kii sabase badi maar mahilaon va anusuchit jati ke ummidavaaron par padegi
 For this reason, this ordinance is also against the basic spirit of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, which aims to ensure political participation of marginalized sections by providing reservation and linking them to the mainstream
 payalat ne kaha ki yadi bhaajapa ke vartmaan vidhayakon kii shaikshanik yogyata par najar daali jaye to aashcharyachakit karne vaale aankade saamne aaenge kyonki bhaajapa ke 160 vidhayakon main se 23 vidhayak swat hi ayogy ho jaaenge
 Pilot said that the state government's decision to change the name of Rajiv Gandhi Seva Kendras to Atal Seva Kendra is a reflection of the narrow mindset of the BJP government
 unhone kaha ki jab-jab bhaajapa kii sarkaar kendra va rajya main banati he to unke netaa apni vichaardhaara ko thompane ke liye purvavarti congress sarkaron dwaara jari yojanaon, kaaryakramon evam uplabdhiyon kaa naam badalakar apane netaaon ke naam lagu kar vaah-wahi luutane kaa kaam karte hai
 Pilot said in response to a question that the Congress has no option to go to court regarding this issue
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar adhyadesh aise samay laayi he jab adaalaton main avkaash chal rahaa he or isi bich chunaav aachaar samhita lag gai
 Pilot alleged that the government had done so under a political conspiracy
 isse pradesh kii aadhi jansankhya ko uske chunaav ladane ke adhikaar se vanchit kar diya he

 Everyone knows what it means to dance to Indian weddings
 yahaan kisi bhi chiz ko lekar samjhauta kiya ja saktaa he lekin jab tak shaadi main dhol, bollywood gane or nagin dance na ho, baat banati si nahin lagati he
 But in this dance-song environment, we have often seen the bride standing between her friends blushing
 aise main pichley kuch dinon se aise video viral ho rahe hai jisamen dulhan dil khol ke naach rahi he
 a few days ago a video went viral in which the bride was dancing on 'london Thumkada' and 'kala Chashma'

 It was shared on January 21 and is trending on youtube
 37 senkad ke is video main punjab ke lokapriy geet 'dhol jagiro da' par is dulhan kaa dance kai hone vaali dulhanon ko apni shaadi par aisa hi kuch karne ke liye prerit kar saktaa he
 Why not, when everyone can enjoy from the bride to the relatives, baraati, friends in the wedding, then why should the bride stand lazily-shamai in a corner
 aakhir shaadi to uski bhi he naa
 
 
 We look forward to the day when every bride can enjoy her wedding with equal ease
 shaayad uske baad hamaise video ko isliye nahin dekhenge kyonki isamen dulhan naach rahi he, balki isliye dekhenge kyonki wo bahut acha dance kar rahi he
 The comments is video ko abhi tak 11 lakh se zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 In this video of 37 seconds, the dance of this bride on the popular song 'dhol Jagiro Da' from Punjab can inspire many brides to do something similar on their wedding
 ho bhi kyon naa, shaadi main dulhe se lekar rishtedaar, baaraati, saheliyaan jab sab anand le sakate hai to phir dulhan kyon lajjai-sharmai dubkkar ek kone main khadi rahe
 After all, she is married too
 
 
 hamen intazaar he us din kaa jab har dulhan itani hi sahajata ke saath apni shaadi kaa anand le sake
 Maybe after that we will not see such a video because the bride is dancing in it, but because she is dancing very well
 tippaniyan This video has been viewed more than 11 lakh times so far
