 gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance
 ejiniyari, udyog evam sankhyikee main kisi maapan kii yatharthata kaa arth yah he ki maap se praapt maan vaastavik yaa satya maan ke kitna nikat he
 On the other hand, the precision of a measurement system means that many times, in unchanged positions, the values obtained when measuring the same amount remain around a certain value
 at: parishuddhta ko punarutpaadakta bhi kah sakate hai
 Although in normal usage, these two words can be interchanged, but in scientific knowledge, there is deliberate difference between them
 koi maapan nimnlikhit chaar prakaar kaa ho saktaa he- a measurement is considered valid or good when it is "accurate and accurate"

 He worked for a long time in the monarchy of Cuttack and was also a member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly
 angrez sarkaar ne unhen rhibahadur kaa khitaab diya tha
 Prabhavati Devi's father's name was Ganganarayan Dutt
 dutt parivaar ko kolkata kaa ek kuleen kysth parivaar mana jaataa tha
 Prabhavati and Jankinath Bose had 14 children in all, with 6 daughters and 8 sons
 subhash unki nauveen santaan or paanchaven bete the
 Of all his brothers, Subhash was most fond of Sharad Chandra
 sharadbabu prabhavati or janakinath ke duusare bete the
 Subhash used to call him Mejda
 sharadbabu kii patni kaa naam vibhavati tha
 After completing primary education from Protestant European School in Cuttack, in 1909, he joined Revensha Collegiate School
 college ke principal benimadhav das ke vyaktitv kaa subhash ke man par acha prabhaav padaa
 At the age of just fifteen, Subhash had done a full study of Vivekananda literature
 1915 main unhone intermediat kii pariksha biimaar hone ke baavjood dwitiya shrenee main uteern kii
 In 1916, when he was a BA student in Philosophy, there was a fight between the teachers and the students of the Presidency College on something that led to the leadership of the students, due to which he was expelled from the Presidency College for a year and also banned the examination
 gave
 49veen bengal regiment main bhartee ke liye unhone pariksha di kintu ankhen kharaab hone ke kaaran unhen sena ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Somehow he got admission in the Scottish Church College, but the mind was asking to join the army
 khaali samay kaa upyog karne ke liye unhone terrytorial army kii pariksha di or fort wiliam senalay main rangarut ke rup main pravesh paa gayi
 Then it was thought that somewhere like BA Intermediate, Subhash studied very diligently and passed the BA examination in the first class in 1919
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main unka doosraa sthaan tha
 The father wished that Subhash should become ICS, but given his age, he had to pass this exam only once
 unhone pita se choubees ghante kaa samay yah sochane ke liye maanga taaki ve pariksha dene yaa na dene par koi antim nirnay le saken
 He kept awake all night wondering what to do
 aakhir unhone pariksha dene kaa faisla kiya or 15 sitambar 1919 ko england chale gayi
 Unable to get admission in any London school for exam preparation, Subhash somehow got admission for studying Tripas examination of mental and moral sciences in Kits William Hall
 isse unke rahane va khaane kii samasya hal ho gayi
 Recently, taking admission was an excuse to show the real purpose by passing in ICS
 so unhone 1920 main variyata suchi main chauthaa sthaan praapt karte hue paas kar lee
 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS? Wrote a letter of resignation from the ICS to the Secretary of India ES Montague on 22 April 1921
 ek patr deshvandhu chittaranjan das ko likhaa
 But soon after getting the letter from his mother Prabhavati that "father, family members or anything else, they are proud of their son's decision
" " subhash june 1921 main maansik evam naitik vigyaan main trypass kii degree ke saath swadesh waapas laut aaye
 Inspired by the work of the freedom fighter Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das of Kolkata, he wanted to work with Subhash Dasbabu
 england se unhone dasababu ko khat likhakar unke saath kaam karne kii ichha prakat kii
 According to the advice of Rabindranath Thakur, on his return to India, he first went to Mumbai and met Mahatma Gandhi
 mumbai main gandhi ji manibhawan main nivas karte the
 Gandhiji and Subhash met for the first time on 20 July 1921
 gandhi ji ne unhen kolkata jaakar dasababu ke saath kaam karne kii salaah di
 Subhash then came to Kolkata and met Dasbabu
 un dinon gandhi ji ne angrez sarkaar ke khilaaf asahyog andolan chalaa rakhaa tha
 Dasbabu was leading this movement in Bengal
 unke saath subhash is aandolan main sahabhaagi ho gayi
 In 1922, Dasbabu founded the Swaraj Party under the Congress
 vidhansabha ke andar se angrez sarkaar kaa virodh karne ke liye kolkata mahapalika kaa chunaav swaraj party ne ladakar jeeta or dasababu kolkata ke mahayor ban gayi
 He made Subhash the chief executive officer of the municipality
 subhash ne apane kaarykaal main kolkata mahapalika kaa puraa dhaanchaa or kaam karne kaa tarika hi badal daalaa
 All the routes in Kolkata were changed to English names and given Indian names
 swatantrata sangram main praan nyochhavar karne waalon ke parivarajanon ko mahapalika main naukari milane lagi
 Very soon Subhash became an important youth leader of the country
 jawaharlal nehru ke saath subhash ne congress ke antargat yuvakon kii independence lig shuru kii
 When the Simon Commission came to India in 1928, the Congress showed it black flags
 kolkata main subhash ne is aandolan kaa netritv kiya
 To answer the Simon Commission, the Congress entrusted the task of framing the future Constitution of India to the eight-member Commission
 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey
 is din ke baad ve kabhi kisi ko dikhaayi nahin diye
 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention
 kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh de diya he
 This petition has been filed by the government organization India Smile
 is yachika main bharat sangh, rashtriya salaahkaar parishad, ro, khufia vibhaag, pradhanmantri ke nijee sachiv, raksha sachiv, grih vibhaag or pashchim bengal sarkaar sahit kai anya logon ko prativaadee banaaya gaya he
 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
 navambar 1945 main dilli ke laal kile main aaazaad hind fouj par chalaaye gayi mukademe ne netaji ke yash main varnanaatit vruddhi kii or ve lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja pahunche
 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 gharâ€“ghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India
 aaazaad hind fouj ko chhodkar vishwa-itihaas main aisa koi bhi drushtaant nahin miltaa jahaan tees-pantis hajaar yudhbandiyon ne sangathit hokar apane desh kii aazaadee ke liye aisa prabal sangharsh chhedaa ho
 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses
 swatantryavir saavarkar ne swatantrata ke uparant desh ke krantikariyon ke ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya tha or usamen adhyaksh ke asana par netaji ke tailchitr ko asin kiya tha
 It was an unprecedented salute given by one Krantivir to another Kranti Veer
 apane sangharmpurn evam atyadhik vyast jivan ke baavjood netaji subhash chandra bose swaabhaavik rup se lekhan ke prati bhi utsuk rahe hai
 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript
 iske atirikt netaji ne apane bahuaiami swatantraaa sangharsh ke sandarbh main aganit patr likhe, bhaashan diye evam radio ke madhyam se bhi unke vyaakhyaan prasaarit hue
 a large volume of letters is also related to his personal life
 disambar 1940 se netaji ke antim samay tak unke purna vishwaasapaatr tathaa nikat sahyogi rahe dow0 shishir kumaar bose ne netaji research beuro kii sthapana kar netaji ke 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kaa vishaal kaary mukhyatah vinod si0 choudhary ke saath milakar 1961 isvi main aarambh kiya tha or 1980 main 12 khandon main sankalit rachanaaon ke prakaashan kaa kaam shuru hua
 The initial plan was to publish 'samagra Sahitya' in 10 volumes, but later the scheme was reduced to 12 sections
 april 1980 main sarvapratham bangla main iske pratham khand kaa prakaashan hua tha or november 1980 main angreji main
 Its first volume in Hindi was published in 1982 and then overall literature in these three languages continued to be published
 iskaa antim khand 2011 i0 main chap kar aa paaya; haalanki isaki saamagree pehle se hi taiyaar thi
 Sugat Bose was also associated with the compilation and publication work of this 'samagra Vaamay' and the last two volumes were published mainly due to the sad demise of Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose in the editing of Sugat Bose itself

 Although the definition and field of ethics have been subject to differences in each age, it can be widely said that ethics discusses general principles on the basis of which human actions and objectives can be evaluated
 adhiktar lekhak or vichaarak is baat se bhi sahamat hai ki achaarshastra kaa sambandh mukhyat: manandadon or mulyon se he, na ki vastusthitiyon ke adhyayan yaa khoj se or in mandandon kaa prayog na keval vyaktigat jivan ke vishleshan main kiya janaa chahie varan saamaajik jivan ke vishleshan main bhi
 Moralism has developed in two different directions
 ek ore to achaarshatragyon ne "naitik nirnay" kaa vishleshan karte hue uchit-anuchit sambandhi maanviya vichaaron ke moolbhoot aadhaar kaa prashn uthaaya he
 On the other hand he has discussed moral ideals and the paths adopted for the accomplishment of those ideals
 achaarshastra kaa pehla paksh chintansheel he, doosraa nirdeshnsheel
 We have to look at these two together, because the suffix is both enclosed and inseparable
 pashchimi jagat main achaarshaatra ke siddhant jis tarah kalkrmanusaar, ek ke baad ek, saamne aae us tarah kaa krambaddh vikaas paurvatya darshan ke itihaas main nahin miltaa
 In the past, different moral perspectives and sometimes even conflicting approaches continued to develop simultaneously
 at: purv or pashchim main achaarshastra ke itihaas kaa alag-alag adhyayan karnaa suvidhajanak hoga
 Conduct questions have been given an important place in Indian philosophies
 kisi na kisi rup main prayek darshan ne mukti yaa moksh ko saamne rakhaa he or muktilabh ke liye sadachaar ke niyamon kii samiksha aavashyak ho jaati he
 There is some degree of harmony between Vedic and non-vedic traditions on this matter
 aacharan sambandhi shaastra aacharan ko bharat main disha dete hai
 In Jain philosophy, the goal of life is to make the soul attain its original purity
 is maarg kii sabase badi rukaawat yah he ki karmon ne jeevatma ko jad tatv se kalushit kar diya he
 Just as the light of the sunlight in the clouds becomes dim, the atoms of the "pudgal" or root element pollute the consciousness of the organism
 is paristhiti se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye karm ke "asrav" ko rokna aavashyak he
 This is possible only when right knowledge, right philosophy and right character are the achievement of all three
 jain dharm main aacharan ke un niyamon kii vistrut charchaa he jinke dwaara e "triratn" praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 Non-violence is the main among them

 The goal of life is happiness

 Grief is mixed with happiness, but it is foolish to renounce happiness only
 prayek vyakti ko apane hi sukh kii sadhana kerani chahie, na ki dusron ke
 There is a sharp disagreement among various sects of Buddhist philosophy regarding the nature of knowledge and philosophy
 vaibhashik or sautrantik darshan vastavvaadi hai, yogachaar vigyaanvaadee or madhyamik shoonyavaadee
 But on the question of conduct, all Buddhist thinkers have accepted the early teachings of Gautama Buddha
 "chaar arya satyon" main chauthaa, arthath "du:kha-nirodh-maarg" achaarshastra kaa aadhaar he
 Its practical form is "madhyam Pratipada" or Madhyam Marg
 ek ore vyarth atmotpidan, duusari ore kshanik sukhon kii aradhana, in donon "atiyon" kaa parihaar hi sadacharan he
 The work-cause-chain can be eliminated by following the middle path
 janm mutyu ke anwarat chakra se chhutkaaraa nirvana he
 The Mahayana sect interpreted Nirvana more positively
 vyakti ko apane nirvana se hi santusht nahin hona chahie
 The ideal of the Bodhisattva is to continuously strive for the welfare of others after attaining self-realization
 prem, sahanubhuti, anukanpa or pranimaatr ke prati maitri kii bhaavana, in sadgunon par buddha aacharanshastra main vishesh jor diya gaya he
 All sects of Hindu philosophy have accepted the main doctrines of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita as far as conductology is concerned
 upanishdon ne jahaan ek ore param tatv ke gahan prashn ko uthaaya he or brahmagyaan ko hi darshan kaa yartharth lakshya mana he, vahaan duusari ore aatmsaadhana or "sheel" ke vyaavhaarik paksh par bhi dhyaan diya he
 In the Mahabharata, Bhishma has taught Yudhishthira the ethics in which the system of agriculture, commerce etc
 for the subjects, punishment of criminals, appointment of amatya, chara, intelligence, army, commander, etc
, suppression of the wicked, defense of the nation, fort and thesaurus , Maintenance of money, maintenance of the poor, war, control of enemies, price, punishment, distinction, these four measures, worship of sadhus, respect for scholars, society and celebration, gathering, Yvhar and similarly and had a lot of things
 niti vishay par kai pracheen pustaken hai, jaise, ushna ko shukraniti, kautilya kaa arthshaastra, kaamandakeey nitisar ityadi
 The Bhagavad Gita is more important in terms of ethics than philosophy
 brahmavidya or yogashastra kaa samanvay karaane ke uddeshy se nishkaam karm kaa adarsh gita main pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 Inaction is neither the goal of freedom nor of spiritual knowledge
 karmsanyas se shreyaskar he falasakti tyagkar kartavya karte rahanaa
 Patience, composure and self-realization are essential for virtue
 ishwarbhakti or gyaan se bhi manushya kaa jivan parishkrut hokar karmyog main sahaayta milti he
 According to Adi Shankara, the basic philosophy of the Gita is monotheistic
 mukti kaa ekmev saadhan gyaan he
 There is conflict between knowledge and action and coordination between the two is impossible
 phir bhi shankaracharya ne yah sweekaar kiya ki aatmshuddhi kii praarambhik manjilon main karmon kaa bhi mulya he
 Ramanuja considered the importance of Bhaktimarga as the main message of the Upanishads and the Gita
 madhyayug ke bhartiya achaarshastra par, advait vedant kii tulana main, bhaktimaarg se prerana lenevaali vaishnav parampara kaa hi adhik prabhaav padaa
 This trend was reinforced by the Sufism of Islam
 vyapak rup se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki madhyayugin achaarshastra, jiskaa pratibimb darshanik granthon kii apeksha santkavy main adhik spasht rup se miltaa he, maanavtawaad he
 In modern times Gandhism combines all the healthy traditions of Indian ethics
 upanishdon kii aatmsaadhana, jaino kii "ahimsa", buddha kii anukanpa or prem, gita kaa karmyog, islam kaa vishwabandhutav, in sabhi ke liye gandhivaad main sthaan he
 And since these ideals, the ethics of the national Mahatma Gandhi, represent the Indian culture values, even while raising the problems of the country
 achaarshastra ko darshan or dharamshastra se pruthak sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke adhyayan main kathin he, lekin pashchimi jagat kii apeksha purvi jagat ke saanskrithik itihaas main yah kathinaayee or bhi tivrata se saamne aati he
 There are two sources of philosophical, religious, moral, cultural values of China: "taoism and Kulfuchiism"
 inamen aapasi virodh hote hue bhi in donon kaa samanvay hi, pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se, chini vichaarkon kaa lakshya rahaa he
 Later a third ideology made its debut in China, which can be broadly called Buddhist ideology
 laotse -tao ke anusaar prakruti se saamanjasy sthapit karnaa hi "shubh" he
 The essential virtue for this is simplicity, softness, beauty and peace
 maanav ko apana jivan swaabhaavik or ruju bananaa chahie
 Lao-tsu was the originator of this Tao Marg
 kalphushas -kanfushas kaa drushtikon isse multya bhinn he
 According to this, it is the duty of a human being to do the absolute best of life
 yah kartavya use samaaj ke sadsy kii haisiyat se hi nibhaana he
 Achievement and effort are the real "auspicious"
 sadachaar kaa aadhaar he santulit jivan or santulit jivan ke do siddhant hai : "chung" kaa siddhant arthath apane vyaktitv kii ucchtam maangon ko santusht karte raho or "shu" kaa siddhant, arthath vishwa se samasvarta nirmaan karte hue jivan vyateet karo
 Like Aristotle's "golden middle way", the ethos of Confucius is also anti-semitism
 menshisy -mentious kaa achaarshastra kanfushas ke siddhant par hi aadhaarit he, parantu usamen samaajakalyaan kii apeksha maanavvaad par adhik jor diya gaya he
 Many Chinese philosophers were also dissatisfied with the mysticism and exaggeration of the "tao" and the Confucian tradition, formal teachings
 isliye bahut se aise panthon kaa aavirbhaav hua jinhone yaa to samjhaute kaa maarg apanaaya yaa jivan ke kisi vishisht paksh ko lekar ek nae achaardarshan kii sristi kii
 For example, the cult of "motsu" was utilitarian
 sadacharan kaa maapdand "adhiktam upyog" he, parantu iskaa saadhan he prem yaa maitri
 The conflict is so immoral that it becomes redundant and "wasteful"
 "fasia" panth ne achaarshastra ko raajnneeti ke sameep pahunchaa diya or kaha ki rajasatta tathaa vidhaan se hi sadachaar kii raksha kii ja sakati he
 a fervent attempt to coordinate "tao" and Confucianism can be seen in the "yin-yang" doctrine
 vishwa main do shaktiyaan lagaataar kaam karti rahati hai-"yaang", jo kriyasheel, sakaaratmak, "purushochit" he or "yin", jo niskriy, nakaaratmak, "striyochit" he
 A
 Both tendencies are reflected in every object, institution and relationship
 inkaa uchit maatra main vaastavya hi "shubh" paristhiti he
 And it is human's duty to create such a situation
 madhyayugin chini achaarshastra par buddha vichaaron kii spasht chhap he
 Mahayana and especially secondary philosophy developed more rapidly in China than Theravada
 parantu nagarjun ke "shoonyavad" ko paramparaagat "vyaavhaarikta" ke saanche main dhalkar chini vichaarkon ne buddha jeevandarshan ko ek nai disha pradaan kii
 The slogan of this new philosophy is: "one in the aggregate and one in the composite"
 ming yug 12veen or 13veen shatabdi ke achaardarshan main ndehwaad or atibhautikwaad ke spasht chinh hai, lekin "ming" yugin saanskrithik punarutthan ke baad chini vichaardhaara phir buddhivaad kii ore jhuki
 Since then, the ethos of China has remained predominantly intellectual until the modern era
 zarathustravaad main acharsiddhanton ko bada mahatvapurn sthaan diya gaya he
 Certainly little can be said about Zarathustra himself
 "gaathaon" main uskaa vyaktitv aitihaasik lagata he, parantu "avesta" main vah kaalpanik puranic ban jaataa he
 Zarathustradharma is primarily dualistic
 "avesta" main "ahur" ko ekmev paramsatta ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he or kaha gaya he ki "ahur" kii abhivyakti do dishaao main hoti he
 On the one side there is darkness, on the other is darkness Root material object on one side, spirituality on the other side
 lekin "ahur" kaa ekatv keval aupchaarik he
 Accepted - Later on, Mani openly turned Zuruthism completely dualistic
 uske anusaar bhautik vastu ek swatantra shakti he jiskaa aadhyatmasakti ke saath lagaataar sangharsh chalata rahata he
 There are two divisions of human personality: one soul which is light and the other which is dark
 sankalpaikti in donon ke bich main he or kisi bhi ore jhuk sakati he
 Human is independent in direct conduct
 yadi vah chaahe to rachanaatmak alokalakti kii ore apane aapako le ja saktaa he
 Salvation from destructive dark power is possible by renouncing earthly pleasures
 bhavishya main alok kii sampurna vijay nishchit he
 Bringing that vision closer is partly dependent on human behavior
 maanviya aacharan kaa vaigyanik dhang se pareekshan sabase pehle sofist darshanik ne kiya
 BC Healthy traditions of philosophy had formed in Greece since the 7th century, but the first thinkers of Protagoras focused mainly on the external world
 theliz se anaksagores tak sabhi darshanik vishwa ke aditatv kii khoj karte rahe
 Sophists revisited the goal of philosophy and attempted to philosophically assess the direct problems of human life
 protagoras -"manushya hi prayek vastu kii kasuti he"-protagoras kii is ukti main sofist achaarshastra ke achche or bure donon ang pratibimbit hai
 While on the one hand the ethics of this statement bends towards concrete problems, on the other hand it also becomes personal and relative
 gorgius -gorgius ke sampark se protagoras kaa maanavvaad nire ndehwaad main parinat ho gaya or is ndehwaad se, darshanik str par, atiswarthwaad or sukhwad ko bal mila
 Socrates - Against these distortions, Socrates first created an ethics that, despite being idealistic, was based on real conditions
 sucraat kaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 "knowledge is virtue"
 jise uchit karmon kaa vaastavik gyaan he, uskaa aacharan thik hona hi padegaa; or agyaan kii parinti duraachaar main hona bhi utana hi anivaary he
 Sophists used to use the words "justice", "rule", "restraint", but they never gave a subtle explanation
 sucraat ne is baat par jor diya diya ki vyaktinirpeksh naitik aadarshon kaa aadhaar gyanamimasaa hi he
 The difference between "knowledge" and "information" is the same between normative ethics and traditional ethical assumptions
 sabhi kaa lakshya samaan he---"bhalaai"
 But by knowledge only "goodness" and harmony can be reconciled
 or is saamanjasy kaa saamaajik rup keval aise rajya main mil saktaa he jahaan shaskagan achche jivan kii ek kala samajhakar use aatmsaat karne kaa ytn karte rahe
 Aflatun - Plaining true allegiance to the lofty idealism of Socrates, Aflatoon Plato refined his teachings and supported them with philosophical scholasticism
 afalaatoon ke achaarshastra kaa ek pahalu vishuddh tathvik he
 The so-called "power" of the objects of the physical world is mere shadow
 vaastavik satta keval bhaavon yaa prayatnon kii he, kyonki pratyay hi nity or swasampurna hai
 The purest and higher-class effort among these is "auspicious"
 is tarah sadachaar kaa aadhaar adisatta kaa shubhatv he
 But Afaldatun's ethos also has a second, realistic side
 isamen maanav swabhaav kaa sookshm vishleshan miltaa he
 In the words of human nature k-aflatoon has three divisions of the human "soul"
 inhen ichha, samveg or buddhi se sanchaalan miltaa he
 The dominance of the third over the first two departments is the basis of virtue
 vyakti main na keval maanviya pravriti, arthath vivekshiltaa he, varan us main "pashviya" or "vanaspatiya" pravritiyaan bhi hai jo use jaivik or daihik str se upar uthne se rokatii he
 The aim of the intellect is not the destruction of these tendencies, but their rule and control
 is uddeshy kii sahi vyakhya keval saamaajik str par hi ho sakati he, na ki vyaktigat str par
 There are three classes according to the three organs of human nature in society - workers, warriors and rulers
 yah vargvibhaajan prakritik he or vargaheen samaaj kii kalpana nyaaysangat nahin he, kyonki nyaay kaa aadhaar antat: prakritik niyam hi he
 The ideal system is one in which people of every class keep practicing their virtues
 shaasha vivekshil hon, yoddha vir or shramik mehnatee tathaa vinamr
 A
 Virtues are mutually complementary and their proper use is a "moral condition"
 aisi paristhiti antatogatva tisare varg ke logon par hi nirbhar he, kyonki aichhik or samvegatmak pravritiyon ko buddhi hi kaabo main rakh sakati he
 The attitude of the ruling class should be purely philosophical, rational and for this proper education is absolutely necessary
 arestu -sucratvaadi parampara kii parinti arestu ke achaarshastra main milti he
 Aristotle reviewed various aspects of conduct in a scientific manner while analyzing and experimenting
 achaardarshan kaa swatantra "shaastra" ke rup main vikaas arestu ke "nikomekian athiks" se hi aarambh hota he
 According to Aristotle, the expression of "auspicious" occurs in two directions
 pehali disha vah he, jisamen abhyaas or praytn dwaara maanav apni nimnatar pravritiyon ko uccharit shakti ke--arthath buddhi ke-niyantran main laata he
 The virtues that are created as a result of this effort are "moral virtue"
 lekin shubhatv kaa ek doosraa madhyam bhi he-arthath buddhi dwaara vishuddh satta yaa charam satya kii khoj
 This knowledge and meditation creates "intellectual virtues"
 adarsh jivan to aise hi manan kaa jivan he
 
 parantu achaarshastra kaa pratyaksh sambandh bauddhik sadgunon kii apeksha naitik sadgunon se adhik ghanishtha he
 The principle of moral virtue is the principle of the Middle Way
 ek ore atirek or duusari ore abhaav, in donon trutiyon se bachakar hi sadachaar sambhav he
 For example, "courage" is a moral virtue
 iskaa atirek he "asaavadhaanee" or isaki nunata he "kaayarta"
 Similarly, the limits of each moral virtue can be fixed
 aryspitapas -arestu ke baad greek achaarshastra kii dhara do virdohi dishaao main vibhakt ho gai
 On one hand, Epicurus posited hedonism and on the other, genes put asceticism as the ideal
 vastav main in donon ke beej sucraat yug main hi pad chuke the
 The basic source of Epicurus' hedonism is the "cyrenic" ethos and the "stoic" system of Zeno is the basis of the anti-hedonistic philosophy of the "cynic" cult
 sireneik panth kaa pravartak aristipas tha or sinic panth kii sthapana sucraat ke shishy antistheneez ne kii thi
 Epicurus - Epicurean ethics considers satisfaction and solution as the goal of life, considering knowledge and conscience as mere means
 sukh ke prati khinchaav or du:kha kaa everjan swaabhaavik pravritiyaan hai
 The "cyrenaic" approach was originally justified, but its explanation of happiness is narrow
 keval kshanik sukh ko sarvasv samajhnaa morrkhtaa he
 Our goal is to make life overall happy
 is kriya main vishisht sukhon ko kabhi-kabhi tyaagna padataa he
 The intensity of pleasures is only one aspect, attention is also paid to their stability
 maansik shanti shareerik ichhaapoorti se adhik sukhmay he, kyonki vah hamen adhik samay tak santusht rakh sakati he
 The supreme virtue is "caution", because it protects us from pain to a extent
 zino -stoikwaad kaa sinddhant iske bilkul vipareet he
 According to Zino, conscience is everything
 sukhprapti kaa apni jagah par koi mahatv nahin he, yadhyapi vivekshil jeevankram main yadi sukh bhi mili to use jabardasti thukraana jaruri nahin he, jaisaa ki"sinikapanthi" karte the
 It is enough to consider sensual pleasures as secondary and trivial
 "prakruti ke anusaar jivan" kaa matlab he vivekshil jivan, kyonki maanav ke liye chetan, kriyasheel vivekshakti hi "prakritik" he
 The basis of virtue is self-control, duty and self-denial
 naitik vikaas ke maarg main sabase badi rukaawat he asanyam
 In spite of his strong retirement in the "stoic" ideology, Zino and his followers also made considerable efforts to avoid the distorted individualism of the "cynic" creed
 madhyayugin jeevanamoolyon par stoik achaardarshan kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 Seneca and Emperor Marcus Aurelius supported this philosophy
 plotinus -madhyayugin achaarshastra mukhyat: dharmik yaa aadhyatmavaadi he
 Before the fall of the Roman Empire, Greek philosophy began to be re-evaluated in terms of Christian theology
 is tarah kaa pehla mahatvapurn prayaas nakeelatunavaad main dekha ja saktaa he
 The mystical tendencies contained in Socrates - Aflatun - Aristotle's ideology have been elevated to the philosophy of Plotinus
 maanav jivan kaa sarvonchch uddeshy he "ek" athwa "paramsat" kaa aparoksh gyaan
 To fulfill this purpose we have to make ourselves "worthy" and for this morality is necessary
 is tarah plotinus ke liye achaardarshan kaa mahatv simit or sopaksh he
 Other prominent representatives of neo-colonialism are Phyllo and Porfiri
 agaastin -sant agstin kaa "paitristik" darshan bhi ishwaranubhuti ko charam lakshya maanata he
 God-love can be the basis of real morality
 agstin ne yah kahkar ki ishwarkendrit jivan main hi "adhiktam ichhaapoorti" sambhav he, apratyaksh rup se sukhwad ke siddhant ko ek seemaa tak sweekaar kiya
 Thomas Equinus - The most developed form of medieval ethnography is in the philosophy of Saint Thomas Equinus
 ekwines ne isai dharmatatv ko afalatunavaad se arestuvad kii ore le jane kaa ytn kiya
 The research of truth and auspiciousness is possible in two parts - faith and conscience
 ye donon swatantra hai, parantu inamen koi moolbhoot virodh nahin he
 Aristodarshan is the highest success of Viveshkti
 "vishwaas" kii sabase udaatt siddhi he isamsih kaa "yatharthasangat aadhyatmavaad"
 But the successes of "conscience" and "faith" at a lower level than these can also inspire in moral life
 ishwargyan hi param shubh he
 After Equinus the "scholastic" ideology gradually became sedentary and narrow
 achaarshastra kaa swatantra astitv kareeb-kareeb samaapt ho gaya or naitik prashnon kaa vivechan isai dharamshastra kii kuch vadagrast samasyaon main shabdic uhapoh tak hi simit rah gaya
 The modern era of ethics begins with the secular philosophy of the 15th-16th centuries
 is darshan kaa ek paksh vaigyanik or prakrutivaadee he jiskaa swasth rup bekan or vikrut rup habz main jhalkata he
 In ethics, Habs is more important than Bacon
 habz kaa drushtikon bhautikwaadi he
 He considers the existence of objects and motion and sees human behavior in the realm of "object" and "motion"
 chunki vastujgat se maanav kaa sambandh samvedan dwaara hi sambhav he, isliye samvedan hi maanav jivan kaa "mukhya sanchaalak" he
 Desire for happiness and disinterestedness are the basis of human behavior
 vyakti kaa kartavya keval ek he-apane liye sukh arjan karnaa
 Selfishness is natural, selfishness is artificial
 saamaajik sanghathan kaa aadhaar "prayek vyakti kaa prayek anya vyakti se bhay" he
 "rights" and "power" are necessary to achieve happiness in the future as in the present
 isliye adhikarprem bhi prakritik he or aacharan kaa nirdesan karata he
 Internal norms of behavior are selfish, external norms are state or social rights
 habz ke swarthparak sukhwad ke viruddh tibr pratikriya honi anivaary thi
 This response was expressed in "intuitive psychology"
 is pravriti ke pramukh pratinidhi hai clark, kadworth, shaiftsbari, hachisan or butler
 Despite these differences, it is widely agreed that moral law is the "self-evident truth"
 shaiftsbari ne achaarshastra main pehali baar "naitik vivekshakti" kaa siddhant saamne rakhaa
 Butler states that intuitive knowledge of moral rules is possible because nature has â€” or "god" â€” provided us with a special means for this type of knowledge
 is saadhan ko butler "sadasadvivekkshmata" kahata he
 This ability is the real soul of man, the centerpiece of his personality
 hum kaa aacharanshastra phir ek baar samvedanvaad kii ore jhukta he
 Hume believes that accurate analysis of behavior is possible only from a psychological point of view
 manovigyaan kaa is vishay main ek hi nishkarsh ho saktaa he; vah yah ki sukh du:kha hi aacharan ke nirnaayak hai
 Our moral judgments are based on some natural truths which, in their original form, have no moral significance
 kaant kaa prasiddh granth "vyaavhaarik vivek kii aalochana" aadhunik vivekwaadi achaarshastra ke aadharastambhon main he
 Kant attempted to balance the one-sided theories of the earlier thinkers and formulate them in a coordinated manner
 "kartavya" or "swaarth" e donon bilkul alag-alag preranaayen hai
 Out of these, if the life is organized with the duty as the head, maximum welfare can be done

 yah niyam maanav ke liye utana hi vaastavik he jitna anya praaniyon ke liye, yadhyapi maanav jivan main saamaajik or saanskrithik paramparaon kaa nirmaan hua he
 The symptom of "successful adaptation" is the organization of a progressive society in which the benefit of personal happiness is attached to the welfare of the entire caste
 spencer ke sukhwad par bentham or mil ne "upyogetavaad" kaa spasht prabhaav he
 Mill's philosophy is based on the strong "empiricist" tradition that bacon-habz-hume laid

 shopenhavar kaa drushtikon nirashaavadi he
 He considers all history as an expression of "life-style"
 yah abhivyakti jis sangharsh ke bich hoti he vah du:kha or klesh se paripurna he
 The "pleasures" of beings are imaginary and transitory, eerily inspired by them, "sakalp" moves the life-cycle even faster and thus more tribulations arise
 vaise to jeev maatr kaa astitv du:khamay he, parantu maanav jivan main yah klesh charam seemaa tak pahunch jaataa he
 Apart from physical suffering, mental anguish also arises
 aacharanshastra kaa katukartavya he manushya ko yah samajhaana ki jeevansankalp ke vinaash se hi uske du:kha kaa ant ho saktaa he
 For this, all the so-called happy experiences of life will have to be rejected and firstly the "happiness" due to which mankind is sustained

 Nietzsche's ethics also rejects traditional moral beliefs
 nitshe kaa siddhant he "mulyon kaa nirmoolyikaran"
 He complains that the moral principles that have been inspired by Christianity are for the weak, not for the strong
 aisa achaarshastra "karunaa kaa achaarshastra" he
 In fact, there is only one value that a human can take pride in - power
 jisase bhi shakti kaa prasar hota he vah uchit he or jis karm se shakti kii mahatta ghatati he vah tyajya he
 The superiority of the best man is the only good

 20veen shatabdi main darshan ke kuch anya angon kii tulana main achaarshastra kii upeksha hui he
 No new system of ethics was presented here
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki naitik prashnon prashnon ko darshanikon ne gaun samajha he
 Croche, Bergeson, Russell and other modern philosophers have tried to understand the nature of moral judgment from their perspective
 parantu "shubhashubhavivek" ko ek swatantra vigyaan kaa vishay maananevaale vichaarak aaj adhik nahin hai
 The reason for this is that ethics is under pressure from different directions - from sociology and psychology
 ek ore to saamaajik jivan kii badhati hui jatilta hamen is baat ke liye baadhya karti he ki aacharan ke naitik paksh ko raajnneetik, aarthik or saanskrithik samasyaon ke sandarbh main hi dekhen

 tab devi ne vijay kaa aashirwad diya evam swapn main raja ko samudr ke tat se shila rup main unki murti nikaal kar sthapit karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The king, after his victory in 1604, got the rock out of the ocean and got the goddess embossed in Amber and got it installed here
 yah murti shila rup main milane ke kaaran iskaa naam shila mata pard gaya
 a monolithic idol of Ganesh's coral is also installed above the entrance of the temple

 Then, on this rock, the Mahishasuramardini form of Durga was engraved and established in this temple of Amer
