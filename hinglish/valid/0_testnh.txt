 Ethics, also known as Behaviorism, Ethics, Ethics and Ethics, is a branch of philosophy
 yadhyapi achaarshastra kii paribhaasha tathaa kshetra prayek yug main matbhed ke vishay rahe hai, phir bhi vyapak rup se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki achaarshastra main un saamaanya siddhanton kaa vivechan hota he jinke aadhaar par maanviya kriyaaon or uddeshyon kaa muulyankan sambhav ho sake
 Most authors and thinkers also agree that ethics is primarily concerned with norms and values, not the study or discovery of objects and these criteria should be used not only in the analysis of personal life but in the analysis of social life
 i also
 acha or bura, sahi or galat, gun or dosha, nyaay or jurm jaisi avadharanaon ko paribhaashit karke, nitishastra maanviya naitikta ke prashnon ko sulajhane kaa prayaas karata hai
 As a field of intellectual review, he also deals with the areas of moral philosophy, descriptive ethics, and value theory
 nitishastra main abhyaas ke teen pramukh kshetra jinhen manyata praapt hai: In this, the party works according to whatever advice is given to the lawyer and his party
 rashaworth keader kehete hai ki ""nitishastra" kii maanak paribhaashaon main 'adarsh maanav charitra kaa vigyaan' yaa 'naitik kartavya kaa vigyaan' jaise vaakyansh aam taur par shaamil rahe hai
 "ethics are a set of concepts and principles that, as Richard William Paul and Linda Elder define, guide us in determining what behavioral sensitivities help or cause harm"
 cambridge dictionari of philocyphi yah kahati hai ki nitishastra shabd kaa "upyog saamanytah vinemian rup se 'naitikta' ke saath hota hai' or kabhi-kabhi kisi vishesh parampara, samooh yaa vyakti ke naitik siddhanton ke arth hetu iskaa adhik sankeern upyog hota hai"
 Paul and Elder say that most people get confused between social practices, religious beliefs, and behavior, and ethics, and do not consider ethics alone as a concept
 "nitishastra" shabd ke kai arth hote hai
 This can refer to philosophical ethics or moral philosophy
 manushya ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan anek shastron main anek drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he
 Human behavior, like nature's trades, occurs in the form of a work-cause-chain and can be studied and interpreted causally
 manovigyaan yahi karata he
 But we do not characterize natural trades as good or bad
 raste main achaanak varsha aa jane se bhigane par ham badalon ko kuvachy nahin kehane lagate
 On the contrary, on the actions of fellow human beings, we pass judgment of good and bad
 is prakaar nirnay dene kii saarvbhaum maanviya pravriti hi achaardarshan kii janani he
 In ethics, we think systematically and try to know what is the wise basis of our good and evil decisions
 kaha jaataa he, achaarshastra niamak athwa aadarshanveshi vigyaan he, jabaki manovigyaan yatharthanveshi shaastra he
 Certainly there is some fact in this classification of scriptures, but it can also be misleading
 ukt vargeekaran yah dharna utpann kar saktaa he ki achaardarshan kaa kaam naitik vyavhaar ke niyamon kaa anveshan tathaa udghaatan nahin he, apitu kritrim dhang se vaise niyamon ko maanav samaaj par lad dena he
 But this assumption is wrong
 nitishastra jin naitik niyamon kii khoj karata he ve swayan manushya kii mul chetana main nihit hai
 Of course, this consciousness is seen taking different forms in different societies and ages
 is anekarupata kaa pradhan kaaran maanav prakruti kii jatilta tathaa maanviya shrey kii vividhrupatha he
 The thinkers of different countries explore the moral standards inherent in the prevailing laws of their societies
 hamaare apane yug main hi, anek nai puraani samskritiyon ke sammilan ke kaaran, vichaarkon ke liye yah sambhav ho saktaa he ki ve anginat roodhiyon tathaa saapekshya manyataon se upar uthakar vastut: saarvbhaum naitik siddhanton ke udghaatan kii ore agrasar hon
 Meta-ethics asks how we understand this, how we know about it and what it means when we talk of 'what is right' and 'what is wrong'
 yah man main chal rahi ulajhanon kaa ek sakaaratmak nichod he
 Critical ethics is the study of ethics
 yah nitishastra kii vah shakha hai, jo un prashnon ke sammuchay kii jaanch karti hai, jinka udgam yah sochate vaqt hota hai ki naitik rup se kisi ko kaise kaam karnaa chaiye
 Critical ethics differs from meta-ethics in that it examines the parameters of what works are right or wrong, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts
 mandandak nitishastra varnatmak nitishastra se bhi bhinn hai, kyonki pashchaatkathit logon kii naitik aasthaaon kii anubhavsiddh jaanch hai
 In other words, descriptive ethics is concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that murder is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is wrong to hold it
 atah, kabhi-kabhi mandandak nitishastra ko varnatmak ke bajaay nirdeshaatmak kaha jaataa hai
 However, in some versions of the meta-ethnographic view, called moral realism, moral facts are both descriptive and normative at the same time
 paramparaagat, mandandak nitishastra is baat kaa adhyayan tha ki vah kya hai jo kisi kriya ko kya sahi yaa galat banaata hai
 These principles provide broad moral principles to address difficult ethical decisions
 maanav kaa sadaiv se ek pramukh drushtikon upyogetavaad rahaa he
 This ideology reflects that aspect of human behavior, which states that ==naitik darshan== manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain Political ethics is the practice of making ethical ethical decisions about political action and political agents
 varnatmak nitishastra varnapat ke darshanik chor kii ore kam jhukta he kyonki uskaa uddeshy hai kaise log jite hai is bare main khaas jaankaree praapt karnaa or drusht pratimaanon ke aadhaar par saamaanya nishkarsh nikaalnaa
 In relation to what is the basic question of ethics, two important opinions are found
 ek mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kii pradhan samasya yah batalaana he ki maanav jivan kaa param shrey kya he
 On realizing the ultimate credit, we will say auspicious actions to those who are going to take that credit; Opposite actions will be called inauspicious
 duusare mantavya ke anusaar nitishastra kaa pradhan kaary shubh yaa dharmasammat kii dharna ko spasht karnaa he
 In other words, the function of ethics is to clarify the form of a rule or rule according to which rituals are performed as auspicious or religious
 e do mantavya do bhinn kotiyon kii vichaarpaddatiyon ko janm dete hai
 The ultimate credit has been conceived in many ways; We will describe these fantasies or theories further
 yahan ham sankshep main yah vimarsh karenge ki naitikta ke niyam-yadi vaise koi niyam hote hai to-kis koti ke ho sakate hai
 The notion of a rule or law comes either from the penal law of the state or from the physical sciences, where the laws of nature are cited
 rajya ke kanoon ek prakaar ke shaskaon kii newnaadhik niyantrit ichha dwaara nirmit hote hai
 They are sometimes made for the benefit of some classes, they can be broken and some people may be harmed by their adherence
 iske vipareet prakruti ke niyam akhandaneey hote hai
 State laws are subject to change, but laws of nature are immutable
 niti yaa sadachaar ke niyam aparivartaneey, paalankarta ke liye kalyankar evam akhandaneey samajhe jate hai
 In these respects the rules of ethics are completely similar to the laws of health science
 aisa jaan padataa he ki manushya athwa maanav prakruti do bhinn kotiyon ke niyamon ke niyantran main vyaprut hoti he
 On the one hand, human beings are subject to laws which are inaugurated or represented in the physical sciences, chemistry, science, psychology, psychology etc
 and on the other hand the rules of ideal sciences, such as health science, logic, etc
, which they are not bound by, but which are followed It is necessary for its happiness and progress
 nitishastra ke niyam is duusari koti ke hote hai
 Following are the major problems of ethics- nitishastra kii samasyaon ko ham teen virgon main baant sakate hai : Many imaginations have been made in the East and West about the ultimate credit
 bharat main praaia: sabhi darshan yah maanate hai ki jivan kaa charam lakshya sukh he, kintu unamem se adhikansh kii sukh sambandhi dharna tathakthith saukhyavaad se nitant bhinn he
 In this second or prevailing sense, we can only call the Charvak philosophy a Soukhvadi
 charvak ke naitik mantavyon kaa koi vyavasthit varnan uplabdh nahin he, kintu yah samajha jaataa he ki uske saukhyavaad main sthool andriya sukh ko hi mahatv diya gaya he
 Other philosophies of India, the ultimate happiness which is called the goal of life, have been equated with class, liberation or salvation or nirvana
 nyaay tathaa sankhya darshanon main apvarg yaa mukti kii kalpana kii gai he, use bhavatmak sukhrup nahin kaha ja saktaa kintu upanishdon tathaa vedant kii muktavastha aanandarup kahi ja sakati he
 Both the liberation of Vedanta and the nirvana of Buddhists are indicative of the situation when the soul of a person goes beyond the duality of happiness, sorrow etc
 yah sthiti jeevankaal main bhi aa sakati he; bhagavadgita main sthitprajna kaha gaya he vah ek prakaar se jivanmukt hi kaha ja saktaa he
 In Western philosophies, many opinions regarding the ultimate credit are found: hamaare param shrey athwa shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa saadhan yaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhi vibhinn matvaad hai
 In the opinion of most suffragists, the perception of good and evil is through wisdom
 hegel, breadle aadi kaa mat yahi he or kaant kaa mantavya bhi iskaa virdohi nahin he
 Kant believes that ultimately our sense of action is the source of moral ideals
 anubhavvaadiyon ke anusaar hamaare shubh ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot anubhav hi he
 This view gives rise to moral ambiguity
 teesraa mat pratibhaanvaad athwa apyajhhvjj ) he
 According to this view, there is such a power within us that we know or know the auspicious inauspicious way
 pratibhaanvaad ke anek rup hai
 The British philosophers named Shaftesbury and Hutcheson thought that just like the senses accepting Roopa Rasa etc
, we also have a moral sense in us that directly sees good and evil
 bishap butler naam ke vichaarak ke mat main hamaare andar sadasadbuddhi naam kii ek prerak vritti hoti he jo swaarth tathaa pararth ke bich uthanevaale dwandv kaa samaadhaan karti hui hamen auchity kaa maarg dikhalaataa he
 There are many motivational circles of our conduct; One instinct is self-love, the other is self-interest
 sadasadbuddhi kaa sthaan in donon se upar he, vah in donon ke upar nirnaayak rup main pratishthit he
 The German thinker Kant is also counted among the pratibhists
 pratibhanvaadee naitik siddhanton kaa ek saamaanya lakshan yah he ki ve kisi kaary kii bhalaai buraai ke nirnay ke liye uske parinaamon par dhyaan dena aavashyak nahin samajhate
 No karma becomes auspicious or inauspicious because its results are of one or the other category
 yaa kisi kaary ke samast parinaamon kii purvakalpana waisi hi kathin he jaisaa ki unpar niyantran kar sakna
 The good and evil of karma are determined by its motivation
 jis karm ke mul main shubh prerana he vah sat karm he, ashubh prerana main janm lenevaala karm asat karm yaa paap he
 Thorn's statement that auspicious resolution is a thing that is self-respecting, whose credibility is absolute and definite; The credit of all remaining items is relative
 keval shubh sankalpaikti hi apni shreyrup jyoti se prakashit hoti he
 Indian thinkers have also expressed many opinions regarding what is the source of knowledge of moral auspicious and inauspicious
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar shruti dwaara prerit aachaar hi dharm he or shruti yaa veda dwaara nishiddh karm adharm
 Thus religion and unrighteousness are law-abiding
 bhagavadgita main nishkaam karmyog kii shiksha ke saath-saath yah batalaaya gaya he ki kartavya-kartavya kii jaankaree ke liye shaastra hi pramaan he
 Under the scripture, both Shruti and Smriti are calculated
 hindu dharm ke prayek varna tathaa ashram ke liye alag-alag kartavyon kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he; in kartavyon kaa vishad vivechan dharmasutron tathaa smritigranthon main miltaa he
 In addition to the duties of this category, it has also been considered as proof for the understanding of general religion or universal religions
 sajjanon ke aachaar ko pathpradarshak rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The basis of the imperative of moral conduct has also been conceived in many ways
 manushya ke itihaas main naitikta kaa sabase mahatvapurn niamak dharm rahaa he
 We should follow moral rules, because that is what favors God or theology
 sadachaar kii duusari niamak shakti rajya he
 Kingship is an important factor in preventing people from immoral acts
 isi prakaar samaaj kaa bhay bhi naitik niyamon ko shakti detaa he
 According to thorn, we should do religion for ourselves; Duty of duty is itself a favored or practicable object
 jo vichaarak kartavya-kartavya ko paramashrey kii apeksha se rakshit karte hai, ve kah sakate hai ki naitik achaaran kii prerana mulat: atmonnati kii prerana he
 We do auspicious actions, because by doing that we progress towards our ultimate credit
 nitishastra kii ek mahatvapurn samasya yah he ki kya manushya karm ke liye swatantra he? jab ham ek vyakti ko uske kisi kaary ke liye bhala bura kehete hai, tab spasht hi use us kaary ke liye uttaradaayi maan lete hai, jiskaa matlab hota he yah prachhann vishwaas he ki vah vyakti vichaaradhin kaary karne na karne ke liye swatantra tha
 The thorn says: Since i must, i can
 taatpary yah ki karta kii swatantraaa ko maane bina naitik jivan evam naitik moolyankan kii vyavastha sambhav nahin dikhti
 We do not call the trades of nature as bad, but only give such judgment on the deeds of man; This shows that there is some difference between natural and human businesses
 yah antar manushya kii swatantraaa ke kaaran he
 a person's determination to make the ritual of an action not a matter of desire is free
 nirdharanwad ke poshakon ko ukt mat grahya nahin he
 Physics states that there is unbroken rule of work-cause-rule everywhere in the universe
 prayek vartmaan ghatana kaa nirdhaaran ateet hetuon se hota he
 The whole world is a large work-cause-tradition
 sab prakaar kii ghatnaayen akhand niyamon ke adheen hai
 In such a situation, how can it be believed that human beings are free of choice and business without reason and ruleless? The activities of human beings cannot be considered exceptional in the phenomenology of the world
 yadi anek avasaron par ham maanviya vyapaaron ke sambandh main safal bhavishyavaanee nahin kar sakate to iskaa kaaran hamaari un vyapaaron ke niamak niyamon kii apurna jaankaree he, na ki un vyapaaron kii niyamaheenata
 The theory of determinism is bolstered by the physical scriptures; He also derives support from the mechanistic interpretation of nature
 kintu iskaa yah matlab nahin ki nirdharanwad ek bhautik siddhant he
 It is said that there is no place for the freedom of the individual in the philosophies of Spinoza and Hegel
 sankhya darshan main purush ko nirgun tathaa niskriy mana gaya he
 All actions are attributed to the intellect and intelligence is said to be governed by three qualities

 From this point of view, the accounts of capital and withdrawal are also personal as these transactions related to the owner of the business are written
 vyapaar ke swami ke vyaktigat khate ko puunji khaataa kaha jaataa he
 Withdrawal account is opened by the business owner to withdraw money from the business

 udhaaharan ke liye vetan, mazdooree, kamishan, byaaj ityadi ke khate nammaatr ke khate hote hai
 Each transaction has two sides
 rini yaa debit paksh or dhani yaa credit paksh
 For this reason, each account has two parts to write its account
 baayen haath kii ore bhaag ‘rini paksh’ hota he or daahine haath kii ore kaa bhaag ‘dhani paksh’ hota he
 Debit or credit to accounts - When an account is a 'lane' party in a transaction, that is, it gets debited then the accounts are debited
 debit karne kaa matlab yah he ki khate ke rini bhaag main lenden kaa lekha hoga
 Similarly, when an account is a party to a transaction, that is, someone gains something from it, then that account is credited
 arthath us khate ke credit bhaag main lenden kaa lekha kiya jayega
 In this transaction one account and another account are credited in this way
 debit khate main debit kii ore lekha tathaa credit khate main credit kii ore lekha hota he
 Credit and debit accounting is done for every transaction according to double account system
 udhaaharan - yadi hamane mohan se 100 rupaye kaa maal kharida he to isamen do khate hue- ek maal kaa doosraa mohan kaa
 One account will be done in the account of the receiver ie goods account and the other account will be done in the account of the recipient ie Mohan
 isi kaaran is pranali ko dohare lekhe kii pranali kaha gaya he
 Each transaction has two accounts, a debit and a credit

 apni aawaaj kii madhurata or paraas kii adhikta ke liye inhone apane samakaleen gayakon ke bich alag pahchaan banaai
 They were also called shahnshah-e-taranum
 mohammad rafi kii awaz ne apane aagaamee dinon main kai gayakon ko prerit kiya
 Among them, the names of Sonu Nigam, Muhammad Aziz and Udit Narayan are notable - although many of them now have their own distinct identity

 These include ghazals, bhajans, patriotic songs, qawwali and songs sung in other languages in addition to mainstream Hindi songs

 On 24 December 2017, on the 93rd birthday of Mohammed Rafi ji, Google honored him and made a doodle in his memory and dedicated his songs and his memories
 The doodle was created by Mumbai painter Sajid Sheikh
 mohammad rafi kaa janm 24 disambar 1924 ko amritsar, ke paas kotla sultan singh main hua tha
 His family moved from Lahore to Amritsar in the early childhood
 inke parivaar kaa sangeet se koi khaas sarokaar nahin tha
 When Rafi was younger, his elder brother had a barber shop, Rafi used to spend a lot of time there
 kaha jaataa he ki rafi jab saat saal ke the to ve apane bade bhai kii dukaan se hokar guzarane vaale ek fakir kaa peechha kiya karte the jo udhar se gaate hue jaaya karata tha
 Rafi liked his voice and Rafi used to imitate him
 unki nakal main awvalata ko dekhakar logon ko unki aawaaj bhi pasand aane lagi
 People started praising her songs in the barber shop
 lekin isse rafi ko sthaneey khyaati ke atirikt or kuch nahin mila
 His elder brother Mohammad Hameed noticed his interest in his music and asked him to take music education to Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan
 ek baar akashwani lahore main us samay ke prakhyat gayak-abhinayta kundan laal sahagal apana pradarshan karne aae the
 Mohammad Rafi and his elder brother also went to hear this
 bijli gul ho jane kii vajah se sahagal ne gane se manaa kar diya
 Rafi's elder brother requested the organizers that Mohammad Rafi should be given a chance to sing in order to calm the anxiety of the crowd
 unako anumati mil gai or 13 varsh kii aayu main mohammad rafi kaa ye pehla saarvajanik pradarshan tha
 Among the observers, Shyam Sundar, who was a famous musician of that time, also heard him and was impressed
 unhone mohammad rafi ko apane liye gane kaa nyauta diya
 Mohammed Rafi's first song was for a Punjabi film Gul Baloch which he sang in 1944 under the direction of Shyam Sundar
 san 1946 main mohammad rafi ne bombay aane kaa faisla kiya
 Music composer Naushad gave him the opportunity to sing in a film called Aap
 naushaad dwaara surabaddh geet tera khilonaa tutaa se rafi ko pratham baar hindi jagat main khyaati mili
 After this, Rafi sang songs in Shaheed, Mela and Dulari which became very famous
 1951 main jab naushaad film baiju baavaraa ke liye gane bana rahe the to unhone apane pasandida gayak talat mahmud se gavaane kii sochi thi
 It is said that once he saw Talat Mehmood smoking he changed his mind and asked Rafi to sing
 baiju baavaraa ke gaanon ne rafi ko mukhyadhara gayak ke rup main sthapit kiya
 Naushad then gave Rafi many songs to sing under his direction
 lagbhag isi samay sangeetkaar jodi shankar-jaykishan ko unki aawaaj pasand aayi or unhone bhi rafi se gane gavaana aarambh kiya
 Shankar Jaikishan was Raj Kapoor's favorite composer at the time, but Raj Kapoor liked Mukesh's voice only
 baad main jab shankar jaykishan ke gaanon kii maang badi to unhone lagbhag har jagah rafi sahab kaa prayog kiya
 Even Rafi Sahab sang for Raj Kapoor many times
 jald hi sangeetkaar sachin dev burman tathaa ullekhneey rup se o pi naiyyar ko rafi kii awaz bahut raas aayi or unhone rafi se gavaana aarambh kiya
 OP Nayyar's name will be remembered in it as he used the rafi-asha duo in his unique style and his tinkling tunes still seem different from other composers of that era
 unke nirdesan main gaae gaano se rafi ko bahut khyaati mili or phir ravi, madan mohan, gulam haidar, jayadev, salil choudhary ityadi sangeetkaaron kii pehali pasand rafi sahab ban gaye
 After singing for artists such as Dilip Kumar, Bharat Bhushan and Devanand, the list of artists who performed on their songs increased
 shammi kapur, rajendra kumaar, joy mukherjee, vishwajit, rajesh khanna, dharmendra ityadi kalakaaron ke liye rafi kii aawaaj prishthbhumi main gunjane lagi
 Shammi Kapoor was so impressed with Rafi's voice that he used Rafi in each of his songs
 unke liye sangeet kabhi o pi naiyyar ne diya to kabhi shankar jaykishan ne par aawaaj rafi kii hi rahi
 Whether someone calls me Junglee, Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujper Mein, Ye Chand Sa Roshan Face, Deewana Hua Badal is one of the popular songs filmed on top of Shammi Kapoor
 dhire-dhire inaki khyaati itani bad gayi ki abhinayta inhen se gaanaa gavaane kaa aagrah karne lage
 Rajendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar and Dharmendra did not believe that any other singer would sing for them
 
 In the 1950s, Shankar Jaikishan, Naushad and Sachin Dev Burman sang very popular songs of that time from Rafi
 yah silsilaa 1960 ke dashak main bhi chalata rahaa
 The composer Ravi used Mohammed Rafi in the 1960s

 The end of the decade was not pleasant for him after he reached the top of his career in the 1960s
 1969 main shakti samant apni ek film aradhana kaa nirmaan karvaa rahe the jiske liye unhone sachin dev burman ko sangeetkaar chunaa
 In the same year, Dada fell ill and his son Rahul Dev Burman = Avrohan == The end of the decade was not pleasant for him after he reached the top of his career in the 1960s
 1969 main shakti samant apni ek film aradhana kaa nirmaan karvaa rahe the jiske liye unhone sachin dev burman ko sangeetkaar chunaa
 This year, Dada fell ill and asked his son Rahul Dev Burman to record the song
 us samay rafi haj ke liye gaye hue the
 Panchamada got a chance to sing from his favorite singer Kishore Kumar and got it recorded in the voice of Roop Tera Mastana and Mere Sapne Rani songs Kishore Da
 ye dono gane bahut hi lokapriy hue or is gane ke abhinayta rajesh khanna nirdeshkon tathaa janata ke bich apaar lokapriy hue
 Along with this, singer Kishore Kumar also became the first choice of public and music directors
 iske baad rafi ke gayak jivan kaa avsaan aarambh hua
 However, even after this, he gave many hit songs, such as Yeh Duniya Yeh Mahfil, Yeh Jo Chilman Hai, Tum Jo Mil Gaya
 1977 main film ham kisi se kam nahin ke geet kya hua tera vaada ke liye unhe apane jivan kaa chatha tathaa antim film fere eword mila
 Mohammad Rafi was a very devoted Muslim, a man away from addictions and a shy man
 aazaadee ke samay vibhaajan ke dauraan unhone bharat main rahanaa pasand kiya
 He married Begum Wikis and had seven children - four sons and three daughters
 mohammad rafi ko unke parmartho ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 He was very cheerful and generous and always ready to help everyone
 kai filmi geet unhonen bina paise liye yaa behad kam paison lekar gaaye
 In his early days, he sang for the composer duo laxmikant-pyarelal for very little money
 gaanon kii roylty ko lekar lata mangeshkar ke saath unka vivaad bhi unki dariyaadilii kaa suchak he
 At that time, Lataji said that even after singing the songs, singers and singers should get a part of the income from those songs
 rafi sahab iske kilaaf the or unka kahana tha ki ek baar gane record ho gaye or gayak-gayikaon ko unki fees kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya ho to unako or paison kii aashaa nahin kerani chahie
 There was a conflict between the two great artists about this
 lata ne rafi ke saath set par gane se manaa kar diya or barason tak dono kaa koi yugal geet nahin aayaa
 Later, at the behest of actress Nargis, both of them started singing together and sang Dil Pukare in the Jewel Thief film
 unka dehant 31 july 1980 ko hridaygati ruk janeke kaaran hua
 There is some controversy over how many songs Rafi sang in his life
 1970 ke dashak main gineez book of world ricards ne likhaa ki sabase adhik gane ricard karne kaa shrey lata mangeshkar ko praapt he, jinhone kul 25,000 gane ricard kiye hai
 Rafi wrote a letter to the Guinness Book, refuting it
 iske baad ke sanskarnon main gineez book ne donon gayakon ke daawey saath-saath pradarshit kiye or mohammad rafi ko 1944 or 1980 ke bich 28,000 gane ricard karne kaa shrey diya
 In the subsequent search, Vishwas Nerurkar found that Lata had actually sung only 5,044 songs till 1989
 anya shodhakartaaon ne bhi is tathy ko sahi mana he
 Additionally, Raju Bharatan found that between 1948 and 1987 only 35,000 Hindi songs were recorded
 aise main rafi ne 28,000 gane gaae is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil he, lekin kuch strot ab bhi is sankhya ko uddhrut karte hai
 After this research, in 1992, the Guinness Book removed the above record of singing from the book

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he

 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself

 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he

 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he

 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he

 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation
 sampoorn gita shaastra kaa nichod he buddhi ko hameshaa sookshm karte hue mahabuddhi aatma main lagaaye rakkho tathaa sansar ke karm apane swabhaav ke anusaar saral rup se karte raho
 It is easy to do nature's karma and it is difficult to follow the other's nature's karma, because every living being is born with a different nature, it becomes easy to live in the nature that has come into the world
 shri bhagwaan ne sampoorn gita shaastra main baar-baar atmrat, aatm sthit hone ke liye kaha he
 It is easy for the intellect to become detached while doing natural deeds, so it is considered the definitive path
 yadhyapi alag-alag dekha jaay to gyaan yoga, buddhi yoga, karm yoga, bhakthi yoga aadi kaa gita main upadesh diya he parantu sookshm drushti se vichaar kiya jaay to sabhi yoga buddhi se shri bhagwaan ko arpan karte hue kiye ja sakate hai isse anasakt yoga nishkaam karm yoga swatah siddh ho jaataa he

 It is also necessary for the nurse to be familiar with the state of mind of her patients in order to fulfill her duties fully
 rogi kii dekhbhaal karne main keval rog par drushti rakhana hi paryaapt nahin he, varan rogi ko aisa vyakti samajhnaa chahie jo upachaarika se yah apeksha karata he ki vah use suraksha de, use samajhe tathaa usapar mamata rakhe
 Therefore, the yoga of nurses is very important in the prevention of diseases and in the care of those suffering from them

 He has to help the parents and see that the child overcomes all difficulties

 Every nurse of child care needs special knowledge and more skills of child care so that she can take care of them scientifically
 bachche ke liye vah samay sabase adhik sankat kaa hota he jab use aspataal main laayaa jaataa he
 He leaves his mother and reaches a new world, where he does not know what is to be done to him
 uskaa kshubdh maansik santulan tathaa vikal manoveg use beemaari se kahin adhik santrast karte hai
 In such a situation, the importance of personal care in the hospital is more than the treatment
 balak paricharya kii nurse kaa hi yah mukhya kaary hota he ki vah bachche kaa vishwaas praapt kar le or use sab baaten pehle se hi saaf-saaf bataa de jisase vah chikitsak dwaara chikitsa tathaa honevaale kaaryon ke liye taiyaar ho jaae

 Nurses require a lot of skill to handle mental patients
 rogiyon ke bich nurse ko bahut saavdhaanee se apana kaam karnaa padataa he
 His behavior and his intimate care are definitely more useful than any medicine for the patient
 nurse ko rogi ke sambandh main prayek prakaar kaa gyaan hona chahie or un baton kaa to use avashya hi bhalee prakaar pataa hona chahie, jisase rogi kaa maansik santulan bighad jaataa he
 He has to deal with patients with patience, empathy and skill, as if they are his friends and loved ones, because the mental patients get out of the ordinary thing and all the little treatment and treatment they get
 Can destroy profits in an instant
 ye nurson kii vishesh dakshata ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 The nurse has some special duties in each particular area
 usko paricharya kaa laabh tabhi ho saktaa he jab use sthiti kaa sampurna gyaan ho
 But whatever the situation, the same and according to the instructions of the doctor, one has to work like a true servant of the patient

 The communities of Persian-speakers living in Tajik Central Asia are called
 bahut se afghanistan se aaye tajik sharnaarthi iran or pakistan main bhi rahete hai
 Tajik people have a deep connection with the people of Iran in terms of their culture and language
 china ke tajik log anya tajik logon se zaraa bhinn hote hai kyonki ve purvi irani bhashaayen bolte hai jabaki anya tajik farsi bolte hai
 Tajik people are descendants of the ancient Sogdai, Bactrians and Parthians who speak eastern Iranian languages
 iran ke shaktishaalee hakhaamani or saasaani samrajyon ke prabhaav se ve samay ke saath-saath farsi ke bhinn rup bolne lage, jo ek pashchimi irani bhashaa he
 Nevertheless, in Tajiki Persian, there are many words of ancient Sogdai and Parthiai, which are not found in Iranian Persian
 madhya asia main iraniyon ke alaava doosraa bada prabhaav turki bhashiyon kaa rahaa he
 Turks gave the name 'tajik' to Persian-speakers and it meant 'non-turkish'
 kisi jamaane main 'tajik' shabd ko ek gaali mana jaataa tha lekin jab tajikistan soviet sangh kaa bhaag bana to ise garv se madhya asia main bas rahe farsi-bhashiyon kii pahchaan ke liye istemaal kiya jane laga
 The word 'tajik' has remained respectable since the same Soviet era
 tajik log farsi kii ek purvi upbhasha bolte hai, jise 'dari' yaa 'dari farsi' kaha jaataa he
 The word 'dari' is made by shrinking the word 'darbari'
 tajikistan main tajiki bhashaa ko likhane ke liye sirilik lipi istemaal kii jati he, haalaanki puraane jamaane main ise arabi-farsi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 The modern Tajik language has deep influences from the Russian language, the Uzbeki language and the Uygur language
 kuch farsi-bhashi log tajiki ko irani farsi se zyaada shuddh maanate hai, kyonki iran par arab akraman or qabze ke baad bahut baari arabi bhashaa kaa prabhaav padaa
 Arabic words are less in Tajik Persian than in Iranian Persian and more are of ancient Persian origin
 tajikistan main do tarah kii farsi boli jaati he
 One is the daily spoken Persian, which is called 'zaban-e-kucha', that is, 'the language of street-couches'
 duusari aupchaarik taur par bole jane vaali 'zabaan-e-adbi' he, yani 'adab kii bhashaa'
 Historically, ancient Aryan religion, Buddhism and Zarathushtri religion have been emphasized among the Tajik people

 starit shailavigyaan yaa stariki bhoumiki kii vah yah shakha he jiske antargat prithvi ke shailasamoohon, khanijon or prithvi par paae janevaale jeev-jantuon kaa adhyayan hota he
 The layered rockology provides us with information about the various changes that have taken place on the surface of the Earth since its inception
 shailon or khanijon ke adhyayan ke liye stariki, shailavigyaan kii sahaayta letaa he or jeevashm avasheshon ke adhyayan main purajeevigyaan kii
 The aim of the study of layered rock science is to gain knowledge about the development and history of the Earth
 starit shailavigyaan na keval prithvi ke dharaatal par paae janevaale shailasamoohon ke vishay main gyaan pradaan karata he, balki yah puraatan bhugol, jalwaayu or jeev jantuon kii bhi ek jhalak pradaan karata he or ham starit shailavigyaan ko prithvi ke itihaas kaa ek vivaran kah sakate hai
 Layered rock science is sometimes called historical geology, which is actually just a branch of layered rock science
 itihaas main pichhali ghatnaon kaa ek kramvaar vivaran hota he; par starit shailavigyaan puraatan bhugol or vikaas par bhi prakaash daalata he
 Zoologists rely on layered rockology concerning ancestors of organisms
 vanaspativigyaani bhi puraane paudhon ke vishay main apana gyaan starit shailavigyaan se praapt karte hai
 If layered rockology was not there, the knowledge of geologists would also have been limited to the modern form of the Earth
 shilpavaigyanik ko bhi starit shailavigyaan ke gyaan ke bina andhere main hi kadam uthaane padate
 Thus layered rock science is a very detailed science which is not limited to rocks and minerals, but covers all the subjects in its periphery which are related to the earth
 starit shailavigyaan ke do niyam hai jinako starit shailavigyaan ke niyam kehete hai
 In fact, these rules, which were formulated many years ago, are unable to give complete details about layered rock science
 prithvi ke vikaas kaa itihaas manushya ke vikaas kii bhanti saral nahin he
 The history of the Earth is more complicated than the history of man
 samay ne baar baar puraane pramaanon ko mitaa dene kii cheshtaa kii he
 Over time, igneous action, metamorphosis and transfer of rock formations have also changed the form of the Earth
 is prakaar vartmaan pramaanon or upar die niyamon ke aadhaar par prithvi kaa teen arab varsh purana itihaas nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 To know the ancient history of the earth, one has to resort to many other things
 starit shailavigyaani kaa mukhya dhyey he kisi sthaan par paae janevaale shailasamoohon kaa vishleshan, namakaran, vargeekaran or vishwa ke starshailon se unki samatulyata sthapit karnaa
 He also has to give a detailed description of the ancient fauna, geography and climate
 un sabhi ghatnaon kaa jo prithvi ke janm se lekar ab tak ghatit hui hai ek kramvaar vivaran prastut karnaa hi starit shailavigyaani kaa lakshya he
 a wide area lies in the earth's aanchal
 isliye yah swaabhaavik he ki uske prayek bhaag main ek si dashaayen nahin pai jaayengi
 In the bygone era, many geological and atmospheric changes have taken place
 inhen kaarnon se kisi bhi pradesh main prithvi kaa sampurna itihaas sangrahit nahin he
 There are many shortcomings in the history of each continent
 isiilie prayek mahadweep se milanevaale pramaanon ko ekatra karke unke aadhaar par prithvi kaa sampurna itihaas nirmit kiya jaataa he
 But this is a method that cannot be fully believed and therefore it is not possible to establish exactly the same equivalence between rock formations found in different parts of the earth
 inhen kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye starit shailavigyaani samatulyata ke badale samasthanik shabd prayog main laate hai jiskaa arth he vyavastha kii sadrushta
 The evolution of organisms in ancient times was not uniform and uniform
 vayumandaleey dashaayen bhi jeevvikas ke kram main parivartan laati hai
 Organisms that are found abundantly in temperate climates will not be able to survive in hot climates or there will be a huge decrease in their numbers
 hamamen se kuch ko registani jalwaayu na bhaati ho lekin bahut se log isi jalwaayu main rahete hai
 Thus, biology has not taken place in every part of the earth at one speed
