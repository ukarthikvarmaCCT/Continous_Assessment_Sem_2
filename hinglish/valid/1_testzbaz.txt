 ek westoministar pranali main, agar sarkaar khud istipha dene kaa faisla karti he yaa majaboor hoti he to samraat yaa vysarai aadhikarik vipakshi dal se puch sakate hai ki kya vah sarkaar banane ke liye taiyaar hai

 kai sansadeey loktantron main matdaan ke liye avishvaas prastaav rakhane kii ek sakht samay seemaa hoti he or har teen, chaar yaa chah maheene main ek baar hi isaki anumati milti he

 In cricket broadcasting, it is used primarily for analyzing leg before wicket decisions, where the ball is moved up the speed path to determine whether it can hit the stump after hitting the batsman's leg

 By the end of 2005 the hawk-eye was tested by the International Tennis Federation) in New York City and was passed for professional use
 According to hawk-eye, 80 shots in New York were measured with ITF high-speed cameras, a device similar to the mccambs
 During the initial tests of the system, a demonstration tennis tournament was played in Australia
 , An incident occurred in this match in which the ball was shown "out" while simultaneously the word was displayed "in"
 This was considered an error, as the pictorial display of the tennis ball was in the form of a circle, which should have been in the form of an ellipse
 This was corrected immediately

 The 2006 Hopman Cup in Perth, Western Australia, was the first major tennis tournament where players were arranged to challenge point-ending line calls, which were then reviewed by referees using hawk-eye technology
 It used to provide images obtained from 10 cameras to computers for information about the position of the ball

 The 2007 Australian Open became the first Grand Slam of 2007 in which each tennis player was provided with 2 wrong challenges, with an additional challenge in the tiebreaker position
 In the event of an Advantage final set, the challenges for the player would be 2 again in every 12 games, for example 6 All, 12 All
 Controversies sometimes arose when hawk-eye produced the wrong output
 In 2008, tennis players were allowed 3 wrong challenges per set
 The remaining challenges could not be used in the next set
 Once in a match by Amélie Moresmo he challenged a ball that was called in, hawk-eye showed that the ball was out by less than a mm, but it was ruled out
 Thus that point was replayed and Mauremo did not lose the wrong challenge

 In the 2007 Wimbledon Tennis Championships, hawk-eye was also used as an official aid in Center Court and Court 1, and each tennis player was allowed 3 wrong challenges per set
 If there was a tie-breaker in the set, each player would get an additional challenge
 Additionally, in the final set, in which there could be no tie-break, the number of challenges was reduced to three once each player reached the game score 6-6 or 12-12
 Temuraz Gabeshwili first challenged hawk-eye in center court in the first leg match against Roger Federer
 Additionally, during the final, Rafael Nadal played against Federer, challenging a shot called Nadal out
 hawk-eye showed the ball to them, just touching the line
 Fed up with the reversal, Federer requested the umpire that the hawk-eye technology be discontinued for the remainder of the match

 In a 2009 Indian Wells Masters quarter-final match between Ivan Lubić and Andy Murray, Murray challenged an out call
 The hawk-eye system indicated that the ball hit the center of the line, although upon re-viewing the broadcast it was clearly visible that the ball was out
 Later it was discovered that the hawk-eye system had seen the ball from the first bounce in place of the first bounce, which was on the line
 Immediately after the match, Murray apologized to Lubicic for the call and admitted that the point was out

 The website of hawk-eye Innovations states that the system works with an average error of 3
6 mm
 The diameter of a standard tennis ball is 67 mm, thus the error relative to the ball diameter is 5%
 This is roughly equal to the fluff on the ball

 Use of hawk-eye in association football has been proposed but has not yet received general approval from the major operators of the game
 In connection with the system, the Football Association of England has announced that it is "ready for inspection by FIFA", tests have shown that the goal-line incident can be shown to the referee within half a second, There is a governing body for the rules of the game, insisting that the goal should be reported immediately (ie within five seconds)

 At the 2007 World Snooker Championships, the BBC used hawk-eye to depict the player's vision, particularly potential snooker, in television broadcasts
 It was also used to display the intended shots by the player when the actual shot went wrong
 It is now used by the BBC in every World Championship as well as in some other major tournaments
 The BBC uses the system in many ways, for example, at the 2009 Masters at Wembley, hawk-eye was used at most once or twice per frame
 Unlike tennis, the hawk-eye was never used in snooker to aid the referee's decision

 hawk-eye is now familiar to sports fans around the world for the kind of scene it brings to sports like cricket and tennis
 While this new technology has been adopted for the most part, it has also recently been criticized by some, particularly in cases of some specific, high profile calls
 Australian media was critical of a particular LBW appeal made by Anil Kumble at the time of Andrew Symonds' batting in cricket
 hawk-eye showed that the ball was going towards the wicket, but it was seen completely out of the naked eye
 In the 2008 Wimbledon final in a nadal-federer match, the out ball was called 1 mm in, the error was within the advertised error limit
 The system's 3
6 mm statistical error limit was described by some commentators as too high
 Others noted that 3
6mm is exceptionally accurate, This limit of error is considered correct only for ball speed
 Its use in broadcasting to remove the ball's trajectory when it does not hit the batsman is not more reliable, especially in situations where surface conditions may affect its subsequent trajectory, ie when the ball hits the ground or Reach the buzzer only after a short bounce
 Currently, the system is not officially used in such situations, although it is used in television broadcasting and analysis

 In the difficult times of the early 1930s, CBS Radio expanded its offering; After an AP franchise was rejected for the news, Paley started an independent news arm, which was shaped in the first year by Paley's vice president and former The New York Times member Ed Kloeber and news director Paul Voight

 As long as radio was an effective medium for advertising, CBS dominated broadcasting
 CBS programs were often given the highest ratings throughout the 1950s and 1960s
 In the mid-1940s Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen and Amos 'n' Andy, an extremely popular "talent Red" on NBC, were brought to CBS
 From the early days of broadcasting, Paley was also an innovator in making original programming, selling period to advertising agencies as Half or Phool Havar Balok
 Advertising agencies, rather than his network, produced the program to cater for time and so it was "the Johnsons Wakes Program" with Fiber mcgee & Mollie, or "the Pepsodent Show" with Bob Hope

 Towards the end of the war, commercial television once again made the leap, this time in the 1945–1947 period, with three New York television stations clearly presenting an increasing level of programming, which operated in those years, But as RCA and Dumont were vying to set up the network and offer advanced programming, the CBC was lagging behind, and it offered its inconsistent color Rnali began advocating to resume the displacement and UHF throughout industry
 Only in 1950, when NBC was most effective in television and black-and-white broadcasts were widespread, did CBS begin to build or purchase its own stations in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities

 a reluctant CBS star denied her radio show "my Favorite Husband" appearing on television and said it would not happen until the network re-produced the show with her real husband in the lead role
 Paley and network president Frank Stanton had so little confidence in the future of the Lucille Ball series, titled i Love Lucy, that they accepted her wish and allowed her husband Desi Arnaz to take over financial control of the production
 This was the beginning of the ball-arnaz Desilu Empire and became a blueprint for the creation of the series till date

 This success continued for several years, but by the emergence of ABC in the mid-1970s, CBS jumped straight into first place
 Probably due to its status as a top-rated network, during the 1960s and early 1970s, CBS was mingled with the controversial theatrical program of the Smothers Brothers comedy Hover and All in the Family and many of its by-products
 - There was a fear in meeting

 Although RCA made the color system available to CBS, the network had no interest in increasing rca's profits and only made some specials in color for the rest of the decades
 These specials included the Ford Star Jubilee program
 Other special programs were also seen: Cinderella's 1957 broadcast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's, Alladin's musical version of Cole Porters and Playhouse 90, the only color broadcast, the 1958 production of The Nutcracker, featuring George Balanshin's choreography

 All of this changed completely in the mid-1960s, when there was market pressure on CBS TV to add a color program to the regular schedule of the 1965–66 season and to fully color the 1966–67 season
 
 By the fall of 1967, almost all of CBS tv's programs were colorful, as were those on NBC and ABC

 In ancient times, agriculture was cultivated in harmony with the natural environment of human health, so that the cycle of exchange between organic and inorganic materials continued, which did not pollute water, land, air and environment
 bharat varsh main pracheen kaal se krishi ke saath-saath gau paalan kiya jaataa tha, jiske pramaan hamaare granthon main prabhu krishna or balram hai jinhen ham gopal evam haldhar ke naam se sambodhit karte hai arthath krishi evam gopaalan sanyukt rup se atyaadhik laabhadaayi tha, joki praani maatr va vaataavaran ke liye atyant upyogi tha

 Agriculture is the mainstay of rural economy in India and agriculture is the main source of income of farmers
 harith kranti ke samay se badhati hui jansankhya ko dekhte hue evam aay kii drushti se utpaadan badhanaa aavashyak he adhik utpaadan ke liye kheti main adhik maatra main rasinic urvarko evam kitnashak kaa upyog karnaa padataa he jisase seemaanya va chote krishak ke paas kam jot main atyadhik laagat lag rahi he or jal, bhoomi, vaayu or vaataavaran bhi pradooshit ho rahaa he saath hi khaadya padaarth bhi jahrile ho rahe hai
 Therefore, in order to deal with all the above problems of this kind, it has been recommended to cultivate the principle of sustainable farming continuously over the years, which was encouraged by the State Agriculture Department to adopt this particular type of farming, which we have been promoting for organic farming

 For the promotion of organic farming in every district of the state, publicity can be spread among farmers by promoting public tableaux, posters, banners, literature, solo plays, puppet presentations through organic haats and speeches on organic farming by experts etc
 Has been jaivik kheti se maanav swasthya kaa bahut gaharaa sambandh he
 In this method, the body is comparatively more healthy in farming
 ausat aayu bhi babbti he
 Our future generations will also be more healthy

 Organic farming does not lead to crop health and quick recovery

 sanskrit sahitya main bharat ke natya shaastra main adhikanshat: naatakeey paatro ke vargeekaran prastut hue hai or vatsyayan ke kamasutra main etadvishyak bhed prabhed kiye gaye hai jinka sambandh praaia: stri-purush ke yon vyapaaron se he
 In "agnipuran", for the first time, the hero-heroine is discussed as the prolific influences of Shringar Ras
 sanskrit or hindi ke parvarti lekhakon ne "agnipurana" kaa sthiti sweekaar karte hue shringaarras kii simaaon main hi is vishay kaa vistaar kiya he
 These limitations, which have been violated as an exception only, can be understood as follows: bharat ne nayak ke chaar bhed kiye hai : dhiralalit, dhiraprashanth, dhirodatt, dhiroddhat
 These distinctions belong to the protagonist of the play
 "agnipurana" main inke atirikt chaar or bhedon kaa ullekh he : anukool, darkshin, shath, dhristh
 These distinctions are clearly related to the beauty of makeup
 bhoj ne "saraswatikanthabharan" tathaa "shringarprakash" main in do ke atirikt anya anek vargikarnon kaa ullekh kiya he
 But only one of those classifications, which was also mentioned by Bharata as a distinction of man, was accepted by the latter writers: Uttam, Madhyam, Adham
 bhanudutt ne "rasmanjri" main ek nayaa vargeekaran diya, jise aage chalakar pradhan vargeekaran mana gaya
 It is: husband, vice-chancellor
 anukool ityadi bhed pati or upapati ke antargat sweekaar kiye gaye
 Bhanudatta mentions another distinction named Prakrit
 rup goswami ne "ujjvalaneelamani" main vaishik sweekaar nahin kiya
 He considered Krishna the only hero
 hindi main nayakabhed ke pramukh lekhakon ne uparyukt vargikarnon main se pratham ko chhodkar shesh ko praaia: sweekaar kar liya he
 Considering husband, vice-chancellor, Vaishik as the main classification, the favorable, south, shash, hateful distinctions have been placed under the husband
 nayak ke uttam, madhyam, adham bhedon ko hindi main keval kuch lekhakon ne hi sweekaar kiya he, jinamein sundar, top or rasline pramukh hai
 Some other distinctions of the hero are as follows: Proached, obeyed, clever, ignorant
 maani ke do bhed hai : rupamani, gunmani
 There are also two distinctions of clever: vow clever, action-clever
 rasline ne inhen ke saath swayandoot nayak kaa bhi kathan kiya he
 Padmakar is also considered heroic after Bhanudutt's imitation of the ignorant
 keshav ne nayak ke prachhnn or prakaash bhed bhi maane hai
 By the opinion of Rasleen, there are three strains of vice and two strains of Vaishik
 hindi ke nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi sahitya kaa nirmaan adhikanshat: reetikaal main hua he
 This poetry of hero-heroine-distinction is the result of a confluence of two powerful streams
 inamen se pehali dhara he sahityashastra evam nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi shastreey granthon kii, jiskaa aarambh bharat ke "natshastra" se hota he; tathaa duusari dhara he krishna or gopiyon kii shringaar kridaaon ke varnan kii, jo "harivansh", "padam", "vishnu" "bhagwat" tathaa "brahmavaivatan" puraanon kii upatyakaon main bahati hui or umapatidhar, jayadev, chandidas, vidyapati, mira, narsingh mehta tathaa surdaas aadi anek bhakt kaviyon kii madhur vaani se vilsit hoti hui, nimbark, vallabh tathaa chaitanya jaise mahaan aacharyon ke samarthan se sampusht hui he
 From the point of view of Acharya, the Hindi writers' contribution of this part of poetry is extraordinary
 kavyasaushthav kii drushti se bhi vidwaanon ke matanusaar itane unche str ke sahitya kaa itane bade pariman main nirmaan hindi sahitya ke or kisi kaal main nahin hua
 According to Bharata, the heroine has eight distinctions: vasakaja, virahotkanthita, swadhinapatika, kalahantarita, khandita, vipralbdha, prakshitabhratika, abhinasarika
 ise ham paristhitibhed kahenge
 According to later writers, who have been called "prakriti-bhed", there are three types of heroines: Uttama, Madhyama, Adhama
 "agnipurana" ke lekhak ne nayika ke keval ek vargeekaran kaa ullekh kiya he : swakiya, parvikaya, punarbhu, samanya
 Of these four distinctions, Punarbhu was not subsequently recognized
 rudrat tathaa rudrabhatt ne ek shodash bhed vargeekaran prastut kiya, jise parvarti lekhakon dwaara sarvaadhik pradhanta di gai
 This classification is as follows: bhoj ne nayak kii bhanti nayika ke bhi kuch moulik vargeekaran kiye hai, kintu unhen parvarti lekhakon ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 Apart from the above three classifications, Bhanudutt has mentioned a new classification, which was later accepted by most Hindi writers
 vah he, : nayika : anyasambhogadu:khitaa, vakroktigarvita, maanavati
 Quibble: romanticism, aestheticism
 iske atirikt bhanudutt ne shodash bhed vargeekaran main mugdha evam oodhaa ke kuch naveen upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he, jo is prakaar hai, mugdha : gyaatyauvana, agyatayauvana
 Mugdha is again a newborn, Vishrabandhanavoda
 oodhaa : gupta, vidagdha, lakshitha, kulata, anushayna,, mudita
 In Bharata's situational classification, Bhanudatta has added a new distinction named Proshyapatika, which later became known as Pravatsyapatika
 abhisarika ke antargat unhone jyotsnabhisarika, tamistrabhisarika tathaa divsabhisarika kaa ullekh kiya he
 Hindi writers have followed Bhanudutt the most
 shing bhoopal evam vishwanath ne samanya ke do upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he : raktaa, virakta
 Vishwanath mentions five of Mugdha, five of Madhyas, and six of Pragalbha, but the number of heroines does not include these charges
 goswami ne keval "harivallabhaon" ko nayika maanate hue samanya ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 He has also considered Mugdha, Madhyam, Pragalbha Bheda under Perkiya
 rup goswami dwaara ullikhit mugdha ke chha:, madhya ke chaar tathaa pragalbha ke saat prabhed vishwanath krit prabhedon se milte julate hai
 The number of heroic texts in Hindi is more than two hundred, but most of them are unpublished
 sarvaadhik lokapriy granthon main matiram kaa "rasraj" tathaa padmakar kaa "jagadvinod" agrani hai
 Bhanudatta's "rasamanjari" is often followed in these texts
 paristhiti-bhed-vargeekaran main aagatapatika naam kaa ek dasavaan bhed joda gaya he, jise hindi ke adhikansh lekhakon na aarambh se hi sweekaar kiya he

 Kumaramani Shastri, Dev, Dev, Rasleen and Bhikharidas are more important due to their original contribution in later writers

 iskaa prayek pad praaia: kisi ek alankaar tathaa kisi ek nayika kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he
 Samanya was not recognized in this book
 nandadaas kii "rasmanjri" kii apni visheshtaayen hai
 Samanya's statement has been made in this, but no importance has been given to him
 isamen nayikaon kii paribhaashaayen itani vistrut hai ki vanrya nayika kaa chitra sa prastut ho jaataa he or udaahranon kaa abhaav nahin khatkata
 Keshavdas has also mentioned Samanya in his "rasikapriya", not even given his definition
 unhone vishwanath or rup goswami ke anukaran par mugdha, madhya tathaa pragalbha ke prabhed kiye he
 Preamabhisarika, Garvabhisarika and Kamabhisarika are mentioned under the Abhinasarika, and the light and hidden name of each of the distinctions are discerned

 Because man is located inside the Milky Way on Earth, we cannot see the circle and arms of the entire galaxy
