 ayurvedic manishiyon ke anusaar upachaar swayan prakruti se prabhavit hota he, chikitsak or aushadhi is prakriya main sahaayta-bhar karte hai
 The laws of health depend on basic cosmic unity
 brahmad ek sakriy ikai he, jahaan prayek vastu nirantar parivartit hoti rahati he; kuch bhi akaaran or aksmaat nahin hota or prayek kaary kaa prayojan or uddeshy hua karata he
 Health can be defined as the harmony of one's self and its environment

 rog kii avasthaa main, iskaa kartavya upatantron ke vikaas ko rokane ke liye sheeghra hastkshep karnaa or deh ke santulan ko pun: sanchit karnaa he
 In the initial state, the disease elements are temporary and natural balance can be restored by simple practice
 yah sambhav he ki aap swayan ko swasth samajhate hon, kyonki aapkaa shaareerik rachanatantra thik dhang se kaary karata he, phir bhi aap vikruti kii avasthaa main ho sakate hai agar aap asantusht hon, sheeghra krodhit ho jate hon, chidchidapan yaa bechaini mahasoos karte hon, gahari neend na le pate hon, aasaani se farig na ho pate hon, ubaasiyaan bahut aati hon, yaa lagaataar hichakiyaan aati ho, ityadi

 Explaining the measures to protect health, Ayurveda says- arthath sharir or swasthya ko sthir, sudrudh or uttam banaaye rakhane ke liye aahaar, swapn or brahmacharya - ye teen upastambh hai
 'up' means assistant and 'pillar' means pillar
 in teenon up stambhon kaa yatha vidhi seven karne se hi sharir or swasthya kii raksha hoti he
 Along with this, the reasons that make the body sick are also discussed, namely- arthath dhi, dhruthi or smriti ke bhrasht ho jane par manushya jab ashubh karm karata he tab sabhi shaareerik or maansik dosha prakupit ho jate hai
 These evil deeds are called 'pragyaapradha'
 jo pragyaparaadh karegaa uske sharir or swasthya kii haani hogi or vah rogagrast ho hi jayega
 The modern approach to health care is contrary to the holistic approach of Ayurveda; Based on individual rules and completely divided

 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole
 uttari china or dakshini china swatantra mahadwipon par sthit the
 The small continent Kazakhstania collided with Siberia in the Middle Carboniferous era
 pashchimi kazakhstania carbonipheras yug ke ant main baltic se takaraayaa jisase unke bich ural mahaasaagar kaa sampark band ho gaya karne or unamem pashchimi proto-tethis ural parvaton or vishaal mahadweep loresia kii utpatti kaa kaaran bana
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa antim charan tha
 Meanwhile, South America collided with southern Laurentia, closing the rake ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains
 is samay tak gondvanaa dakshini dhruv ke paas sthit ho gaya tha or antarctic, bharat, australia, dakshin africa or dakshin america main glaciaron kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Part of northern China had collided with Siberia by the end of the Carboniferous era and thus the proto-tethys Ocean was completely closed
 parmian yug kii shuruyaat main cimerian plate gondvanaa se vikhandit hokar alag ho gayi or yah loresia kii ore badhane lagi jisase iske dakshini sire par ek nayaa mahaasaagar, tethis mahaasaagar nirmit ho gaya or plato-tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya
 Most of the terrain was still integrated
 trysic kaal main panzia thodaa sa dakshin-pashchim disha main gum gaya tha
 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny
 panzia angreji ke "si " akshar kii tarah dikhaai detaa tha jisamen si ke andar ek mahaasaagar, nayaa tethis mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Pangea had cracked by the middle of the Jurassic period, its fragmentation is given below
 panzia ke jeevashm-pramaan main mahadwipon par paayi jane vaali ek jaisi or abhinn prajatiyon kii maujuudagi shaamil he jo ab kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa
 panzia ke atirikt pramaan dakshin america ke purvi tat or africa ke pashchimi tat ke bich bhuvaigyanik rujhaanon ke milan sahit isse sate mahadwipon ke bhugarbha main paae jate hai
 The polar ice layer of the Carboniferous period covered the southern end of Pangea
 visheshkar ek hi yug tak kii himandiyon ke sangrah or sanrachanaayen kai alag mahadwipon par paayi jaati hai jo panzia mahadweep main ek saath rahe honge
 Paleomagnetic studies of apparent pathways of polar aberration also support the theory of giant-continent
 bhuvaigyanik chattaanon main chumbakeey khanijon ke unmukhikaran kaa pareekshan kar mahadwipiya platon kii halchal ko nirdhaarit kar sakate hai; jab chattaanon kaa nirmaan hota he, ve prithvi ke chumbakeey gunon ko apane andar samahit kar lete hai or yah sanket dete hai ki chattan ke saapeksh dhruv kis disha main maujuud hai
 Since the magnetic poles tilt toward recurring poles occur only over a period of a few thousand years, measurements are averaged over several lavas of several thousand years to determine a clear average polarity position
 talchhati chattaanon or ghuspaithi aagney chattaanon ke namoonon main ek chumbakeey jhukaav hota he jo aam taur par chumbakeey uttar ke jhukaav main in 'ek saamaan badlaavon' kaa ek ausat hota he kyonki unke chumbakeey kshetra turant nahin ban jate hai jaisaa ki thande ho rahe lava ke maamle main hota he
 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents
 vaastavik dhruviya vichlan ke ghatak sabhi namoonon ke liye samaan hote hai or inhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 This gives geologists a part of this drift that shows continental stirring and can be used to help redefine earlier continental conditions
 parvat shrinkhalaaon kii nirantarata bhi panzia ke liye sakshya uplabdh karaate hai
 An example of this is the Appalachian mountain range that extends from the northeastern United States to the Caledonides of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and Scandinavia
 panzia ke vikhandan ke teen pramukh charan the
 The first phase began in the Early – Middle Jurassic period when Pangea began to diverge from the Tethys Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west, eventually leading to the development of the vast continents Lauresia and Gondwana
 jo daraar uttari america or africa ke bich bananaa shuru hua tha usne kai asafal daraaron ko janm diya
 ek daraar ke parinaam swaroop nae mahaasaagar, uttar atlantic mahaasaagar kaa nirmaan hua
 The Atlantic Ocean was not uniformly open; Rifts began to form in the north-central Atlantic
 dakshin atlantic kriteshs tak nahin khulaa tha
 Lauresia started moving clockwise, it moved north to North America and south to Eurasia
 loresia ke ghadi kii disha main badhane se tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta bhi band ho gaya
 In the meantime a new rift had also begun to form on the other side of Africa with the adjacent margins of East Africa, Antarctica and Madagascar leading to the creation of the southwestern Indian Ocean, also opening up in the Cretaceous
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa doosraa mahatvapurn charan praarambhik criteshas kaal main shuru hua jab chota vishaal mahadweep gondvanaa anekon mahadwipon main alag-alag vibhakt ho gaya
 Around 200 MA, the Simaria continent collided with Eurasia as described above
 However, a subduction zone was created when Cimaria collided
 is sabadakshan kshetra ko tethian trench kaha gaya tha
 This sea trench was probably subducted as the Tethyan mid-ocean Ridge, this ridge responsible for the expansion of the Tethys Ocean
 yah sambhawatah africa, bharat or australia ke uttar kii ore badhane kaa kaaran bana tha
 In the early Cretaceous period, the Atlantic, which is today's South America and Africa, was eventually separated from eastern Gondwana, opening the way to the "south Indian Ocean"
 madhya kriteshs kaal main gondvanaa ne vikhandit hokar dakshin atlantic mahaasaagar kaa maarg khol diya tha kyonki dakshin america ne africa se dur pashchim kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya tha
 The South Atlantic was not uniformly developed; Rather it formed as a crack from north to south
 iske alaava usee dauraan madagascar or bharat antarctic se alag hone lage the or uttar kii ore badhane lage the, jisase hind mahaasaagar kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 Madagascar and India separated from each other in the 100–90 MA at the end of the Cretaceous period
 bharat 15 centimetre prati varsh kii gati se uresia kii ore uttar disha main badhata rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band kar diya jabaki madagascar vahiin thahar gaya tha or africa plate main sthir ho gaya tha
 The remainder of New Zealand, New Caledonia and Zealandia began to diverge from Australia and was moving eastward towards the Pacific and opened the way to the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa teesraa mahatvapurn or antim charan praarambhik sinojoik yug main puraa hua
 Lauresia was separated when North America / Greenland was liberated from Eurasia and in about 60–55 MA it opened the Norwegian Sea
 The Atlantic and Indian Ocean continued to expand and the Tethys Ocean's route was closed
 isi bich australia antarctic se vibhajit ho gaya or teji se uttar kii ore bad gaya, thik usee tarah jaisaa 40 million se adhik varsh pehle bharat ne kiya tha or vartmaan main yah purvi asia ke saath ek takkar kii sthiti main he
 Both Australia and India are currently growing in the northeast direction at a speed of 5-6 centimeters per year
 takreeban 280 eme main panzia kii utpatti ke baad se antarctic dakshin dhruv main yaa iske paas rahaa he
 India collided with Asia at the beginning of about 35 MA which led to the formation of the Himalayan orogeny and the Tethys seaway was eventually closed; This collision continues even today
 africa plate ne pashchim se uttar-pashchim tak europe kii ore apni dishaao ko badalanaa shuru kar diya tha or dakshin america uttar kii disha main badhane laga tha, jisase yah antarctic se alag ho gaya or pehali baar antarctic ke aasapaas sampurna samudri parisancharan shuru ho gaya, jiske kaaran mahadweep teji se thanda hone laga or himandiyon kaa nirmaan hone laga
 sinojoik yug ke dauraan hone vaali anya mahatvapurn ghatnaon main california kii khadi kaa khulanaa, alps kaa utthan or japani samudr kaa bananaa shaamil tha
 The fragmentation of Pangea in the Great Rift Valley continues to this day

 a major difference between indo-european languages and Semitic languages is that most words in indo-european languages have a root, which is used to change its meaning by adding letters back and forth
 udhaaharan ke liye 'likh' jad main akshar jodakar 'likhaai', 'likho', 'likhnaa', 'likhaa', ityadi banate hai
 In Sami languages, roots are usually a group of three consonants with vowels in between to change their meaning
 udhaaharan ke liye arabi main: kitaab, qutub, kaatib, kuttaab, kataba, yaktubu 
 In this, meanings are being changed by changing the vowel between the consonants
 angrezi main "sami bhashaaon" ko "samatic langvejiz" kehete hai

998528 Impressionism was an art movement of the 19th century, which began as a free organization of Paris-based artists, whose independent exhibitions brought them prestige in the 1870s and 1880s
 The movement derives its name from Claude Monet's work Impression, Sunrise, which provoked critic Louis Leroy to coined the term in a satirical review published in Le Sherivary
 prabhaavvaadi chitron kii visheshtaon main apekshaakrit sookshm, baariq, lekin drushtigochar brush sparsh, mukt sangyojan, prakaash kaa uske parivartansheel gunon ke saath spasht chithran, saamaanya vishaywastu, maanav-bodh or anubhav ke rup main gati ko ek mahatvapurn tatv ke rup main shaamil karnaa or asaamaanya drishyaatmak kone shaamil hai
 The emergence of Impressionism in visual arts was soon followed by movements similar to other mediums, which came to be known as impressionistic music and impressionistic literature
 prabhaavvaad is style main srujit kala ko bhi nirupit karata he, parantu 19veen sadi ke parvarti samyavadhi se baahar
 The extreme, erstwhile impressionists of his time violated the rules of academic painting
 ujin delacroix jaise chitrakaaron kii rachanaaon se prerana grahan karte hue unhone rang, mukt rup se brush ke prayog, rekhaon ko praathamikta dena prarambh kiya
 He took the painting out of the studio and brought it into the modern world
 isse pehle nishchal jivan or rupachitra tathaa prakruti-chithran praaia: andar hi kiya jaataa tha
 Impressionists found that they could represent the transient and variable effects of sunlight by depicting en plein air
 aadhunik jivan ke yatharth drishyon ke chithran dwaara unhone vistrut vivaranon kii apeksha samgr drishy prabhaavon kaa chithran kiya
 They used partial "fragmented" brush touches of blended and purely blended colors, not traditional light composites or shaded touches, to create the effect of intense color vibrations
 yadhyapi france main prabhaavvaad kaa udai aise samay main hua jab maishioli ke rup main vikhyath italy ke kalakaar or sanyukt raashtra america main vinslo homer sahit anek duusare kalakaar bhi khuli hawa main chitrakaari kii gaveshna kar rahe the, prabhaavvaadiyon ne nai takneekein viksit kii, jo andolan ke liye vishisht thim
 Incorporating what his followers argued as a different view of view, it was the play of light, disorganization and movement using simple postures and combinations of art, bright and varied colors
 aarambh main janata iske viruddh thi, parantu dhire-dhire unhone vishwaas karnaa shuru kar diya ki prabhaavvaadiyon ne ek nutan or moulik drushti par jeet hasil kii he, bhale hi unhen kala aalochakon or pratishthan kaa anumodan praapt nahin hua ho
 Instead of restructuring the subject matter, impressionism became an early precursor of various movements in painting, by the regeneration of stimuli in the eye seeing the subject, and by the creation of waves of techniques and forms, among those who follow neo-impressionism, post-impressionism, Includes biannualism and cubism parivartan ke vaataavaran main jab samraat nepolian III ne paris kaa punarnirmaan kiya or yuddh shuru kiye, 19veen sadi ke madhya main francisi kala paridrishy par aakadami da bukes-arts kaa prabhutv tha
 The Academy was responsible for maintaining traditional standards in both the content and style of French painting
 aitihaasik vishay, dharmik prasang or chitrakritiyon ko mahatv diya jaataa tha or academy saavdhaanee se taiyaar chhaviyon ko praathamikta detii thi, jo paas se dekhne par vaastaviktaa ko pratibimbit karte the
 The colors were indifferent and orthodox and the brush touch marks were suppressed, which concealed the personality and emotions and working techniques of the artist
 academy salon da paris main vaarshik abhinirnaayak kala pradarshnee yojit karti thi or kalakaar apni rachanaaen isamen pradarshit karte, puraskaar grahan karte, kamishan praapt karte or apni pratishtha badhaate the
 The jury's standards reflected the importance of the academy, where the most sophisticated works of artists such as jean-león Jerome and Alexander Cabanel were represented

 Every year, he presented his art salon, but the judges rejected his best efforts in favor of minor creations of artists working in the approved genre

 Soon Camille Pissarro, Paul Cezon and Armand Guillomin also joined her
 1863 main, nirnaayakon ne edward manet kii rachana da lanchan on da grass ko mukhyatah is aadhaar par khaarij kar diya ki isamen picnic par ek nagn mahila ko do vastradhari purushon ke saath chitrit kiya gaya tha
 While nude paintings appearing in historical and metaphorical paintings were regularly accepted by the salon, the jury condemned Manet for portraying a realistic naked woman in a contemporary landscape
 juri dwaara manet ke chitra kii tikhe shabdon main asweekruti or saath hi us varsh asaamaanya rup se asankhya kaaryon kii asweekruti ne francisi kalakaaron main uttejnaa bhar di
 Monet and his comrades praised Manet and held discussions at the Cafe Guerbois, where groups of artists often met
 1863 main asweekrut kaaryon ko dekhne ke baad, samraat nepolian III ne aadesh diya ki janata dwaara swayan kisi kaary par nirnay lenaa anumat kiya jaae or salon da refuzas sangathit hua
 Although many spectators came only to laugh, Salon da Refugees drew attention to the existence of a new trend in art and attracted more visitors than regular salons
 kalakaaron dwaara 1867 main or dobaaraa 1872 main ek nae salon da refuzas ke aagrah vaali yachikaaon ko asweekrut kar diya gaya
 In the latter part of 1873, Monet, Rinoire, Pissarro and Sicily formed the Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs with the aim of making independent displays of their artistic works
 sangh ke sadasyon se, jisamen sheeghra hi sezan, berth morisot or edgar degas bhi shaamil hue, shapathpurvak salon tyaagane kii apeksha kii gai
 The organizers invited a large number of progressive artists to participate in the inaugural exhibition, including Eugène Bodin, whose samples inspired Manet for the first time plein air painting years ago
 ek anya kalakaar johaan jangakind, jisane monet or unke saathiyon ko atyadhik prabhavit kiya, manet kii bhaanti bhaag lene se manaa kar diya
 a total of 30 artists participated in their first exhibition held in photographer Nadar's studio in April 1874

 Hittingly titled his article The Exhibition of the Impressionists, Leroy declared that most of Monet's portrait was a sketch and could hardly be called a complete work
 unhone darshakon ke bich samvaad ke rup main likhaa, ! In its construction condition the wallpaper is more complete than that sea view
 "prabhaavvaadi" shabd ne sheeghra hi janata kaa samarthan praapt kiya
 It was also accepted by the artists themselves, although their group was diverse in terms of style and nature, they were united mainly by a sense of independence and rebellion
 unhone ek saath pradarshaniyaan yojit kii—haalanki 1874 se 1886 ke bich aath baar—sadsyta parivartan karte hue
 Monet, Cicely, Morrisott, and Pissarro can be considered "pure" impressionists for their effortless pursuit of the art of light and color
 degas ne adhiktar ise khaarij kar diya, kyonki vah rangon se adhik rekhankan ko mahatva detaa tha or baahar khule main chitrankan ke abhyaas ko tuchh samajhataa tha
 Renoir turned against Impressionism for a time in the 1880s and could never fully regain its commitment to its ideas
 edward manet ne, samooh ke netaa ke rup main apni bhoomika ke baavjood, kaale rang kaa mukt rup se prayog karnaa kabhi nahin choda or na hi kabhi prabhaavvaadi pradarshaniyon main bhaag liya
 He continued to present his works in the saloon, where his Spanish singer received a second-class medal in 1861, arguing that "the saloon is the real battleground" where prestige can be earned, among others
 He was encouraged to do so
 kendriya samooh ke kalakaaron main daraar utpann ho gai, sezan or baad main rinoir ne, sicily, monet ne salon main apane kaary prastut karne ke uddeshy se swayan ko samooh kii pradarshaniyon se alag rakhaa
 Differences arose in the group on topics such as Guillamin's membership, which was supported by Pistaro and Cézan against resistance to the disqualified Manet and Digas
 degas ne 1879 kii pradarshnee main apana kaary pradarshit karne ke liye meri kasaat ko aamantrit kiya, lekin usne prabhaavvaadi paddatiyon kaa nirupan na karne vaale jin-francois rafel, ludovik lepis or anya yathartwaadiyon ko shaamil karne par jor dete hue matbhed ko mauqaa diya, jiske parinamswaroop 1880 main "pehle aane vaale dabrs ke liye daravaaje kholane" kaa prabhaavvaadiyon par aarope laga
 In 1886 the group split with him on the matter of inviting Signac and Surat to the exhibition
 pissaaro ekmaatr aisa kalakaar tha jisane aath prabhaavvaadi pradarshaniyon main apni kala pradarshit kii
 Individual artists received some financial awards from impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually gained public acceptance and support
 unke dealer duurand-ruel ne isamen pramukh bhoomika nibhaai jo unka kaary janata ke saamne le gaye or unke liye landan or neuyork main pradarshnee kii vyavastha kii
 Although Sicily died in 1899 due to poverty, Rinoire had significant saloon success in 1879
 monet ko 1880 dashak ke aarambh main or pissaaro ko 1890 dashak ke prarambh main vittiya suraksha praapt hui
 By then, the impressionist painting method, in its light form, had become commonplace in salon art
 samgr itihaas main chitrakaaron ne in tareekon kaa istemaal kabhi-kabhi hi kiya tha, lekin prabhaavvaadiyon ne sabase pehle un sabakaa ek saath or itane saahas ke saath prayog kiya tha
 Among former artists whose works of art can be seen demonstrating this technique, Frances Hauls, Diego Velazquez, Peter Paul Rubens, John Constable and J
M
W
 Turner included

 prabhaavvaadiyon ne jin-baptist-cemily corot or ujin boudin ke chitron se bahut kuch siikhaa, jo prakruti ko jis style main chitrit karte the, vah prabhaavvaad ke nazadik tha
 Impressionists took advantage of the already mixed colors in lead tubes introduced in the mid-century, allowing artists to work more seamlessly both outside and inside
 pehle chitrakaar, sookhe rangon ko piste or alsi ke tel main mila kar, vyaktigat rup se apana rang taiyaar karte the, jinhen pashuon ke mutrashay kii theliyon main sangrahit kiya jaataa tha
 Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, particularly 17th-century Dutch painters such as Jan Stein, focused on general themes, but their access to the works was traditional
 unhone apni kritiyon ko is tarah vyavasthit kiya ki mukhya vastu darshakon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne main safal rahi
 Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an impressionist picture would often resemble a snapshot, as if it were suddenly a fraction of the actual scene pictured
 photographi lokapriyata hasil kar rahi thi or camera adhik portable or tasviren adhik spasht hone lagi thim
 Photography inspired impressionists to capture the moment in the camera, not only the fleeting light of the landscape, but also the day-to-day life of the people
 prabhaavvaadi andolan ke udai ko photographi ke nav sthapit madhyam ke prati kalakaaron kii pratikriya ke ansh ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Because of providing a new medium to portray reality accurately, it became a challenge for painters to capture static or immobile images
 shuruuaat main photographi kii maujuudagi, prakruti-chithran or vaastaviktaa ko pratibimbit karne main kalakaar kii kshamta ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali lagi
 Both, pictures and landscapes began to look somewhat weak and far from the reality, as photography "introduced vibrant images with greater efficiency and reliability"
 iske baavjood, photographi ne vastav main kalakaaron ko, yatharth kaa anukaran karne ke liye photographi ke saath pratispardhaa karne ke bajaay, alag kalatmak abhivyakti ke saadhan talashne ke liye prerit kiya or kalakaaron ne apana dhyaan "us ek chiz par kendrit kiya jo anivarytah ve photograph se behatar kar sakate the - yani chhavi kii sankalpana kii mul avastaviktaa ko, jise photographi ne hataaya tha, kala rup main or viksit karnaa"
 prabhaavvaadiyon ne duniya kii vaastavik parchaai yaa pratibimb taiyaar karne kii jagah, prakruti kii apni dharna vyakt kii
 This allowed artists to portray the content they saw with their "compulsory ingrained sense of interest and discretion"
 photographi ne chitrakaaron ko rang jaise, chitra madhyam ke pahaluon ko ujagar karne ke liye protsaahit kiya, jiskaa us samay kii photographi main abhaav tha; "prabhaavvaadiyon ne hi pehle-pahal photograph ke liye puri samaj ke saath vyakti-saapeksh vikalp prastut kiya"
 Another major influence was Japanese art prints, which originally arrived in France as paper wrapping imported goods
 in mudranon kii kala ne "snapashot" konon or aparamparaagat rachanaaon main vishesh rup se yogadan diya, jo aage chal kar andolan kii visheshta ban gai
 Edgar Degas was both a photographer and a collector of Japanese prints

 An English artist, Walter Sickert was initially a follower of Whistler, but later became a prominent disciple of Degas; He did not participate in the exhibition with the Impressionists

 By the early 1880s, impressionist methods were influencing the art of salons, at least superficially
 jin berod or henry jarvex jaise faishneble chitrakaaro ko, salon kii kala main apekshit komal sajja ko qaayam rakhte hue apni rangapattica ko chamakaane ke zarie samikshatmak or vittiya safalataa mili
 The works of these artists are sometimes called as impressionist, even if they are far from the impressionist method
 jaise-jaise prabhaavvaad kaa prabhaav france se pare failane laga, asankhya kalakaaron kii pahchaan nai style ko apnaane waalon ke rup main banati gai
 Some of the more important examples are: murtikar august rodin ko, kabhi-kabhi unke dwaara alpakaalik prakaash prabhaav ko sujhane vaale khurduri satahon ke upyog karne kii paddati ke liye, prabhaavvaadi kaha jaataa he
 Photographic photographers, whose work is characterized by delicate focus and ambient effects, are called impressionists

 French impressionist filmmakers include Able Gans, Jean Epstein, Jermaine Dulac, Marcel l'harbier, Louis Deluc and Dimitri Kursanoff
 sangeet prabhaavvaad europea shastreey sangeet ke andolan ko diya gaya naam he, jiskaa udai 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main hua or jo 20veen sadi ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 Beginning in France, musical impressionism has been characterized by signs and ambient and emotional excesses of the romantic era
 Impressionist composers preferred shorter forms such as nisha-song, arabesque and prologue, and often used unusual gamut-like vocals of the entire gamut
 shaayad prabhaavvaadi sangeetkaaron dwaara prayukt sabase ullekhneey navonmesh deergh saptam taar kaa pehla prayog or taar sanrachana kaa gandhar se pancham or shadj swarasangati tak vistaar rahaa he
 The impact of visual impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable
 claude dibasi or morris raiwell ko aam taur par mahaan prabhaavvaadi sangeetkaar mana jaataa he, lekin dibasi ne is shabd ko aalochakon kaa avishkaar kehete hue, asweekaar kiya
 Eric Seti is also considered to be of this class although his outlook is considered less serious in nature and more innovative in music
 paul dukas ek or francisi sangeetkaar hai jinhen kabhi-kabhi prabhaavvaadi mana jaataa he, lekin unki style shaayad parvarti romancevaadiyon se adhik nikat se sambhddha he
 Music Impressionism Beyond France includes works by Ralph Waughham Williams, Otorino Respighi and composers such as Alan Willicox, Cyril Scott and John Ireland
 prabhaavvaad shabd kaa upyog aise sahitya ke liye bhi kiya gaya he, jisamen kisi ghatana yaa drishy ke samvedi prabhaav vyakt karne ke liye chuninda vivaran paryaapt hote hai
 Impressionist literature is closely related to symbolism, with prominent examples being Boudelaire, Malarme, Rimbaud, and Veralen
 Writings by authors such as Virginia Wolf and Joseph Conrad are impressionistic in their style of narration, rather than an explanation of the influences, sensations, and emotions that constitute the character's mindset
 prabhaavvadottar kaa vikaas prabhaavvaad se hua
 From the 1880s many artists began to develop different conceptions in the use of color, pattern, form, and line derived from impressionist examples: Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Gogwyn, Georges Suurat, and Henri de toulouse-lautrec
 These artists were slightly younger than impressionists and their work was called post-impressionism
 kuch mul prabhaavvaadi kalakaaron ne bhi is nae kshetra main qadam rakhaa; cemily pisaaro ne kuch samay tak bindu-chithran paddati main chitrakaari kii or monet ne bhi khuli hawa main paintig kaa parityag kiya
 Paul Cézan, who took part in the first and third impressionist exhibitions, developed a very personal vision, emphasizing the pictorial structure and is often called post-impressionism
 haalanki ye maamle naam dene kii kathinaayee ko varnit karte hai, mul prabhaavvaadi chitrakaaron kii kritiyon ko, paribhaasha ke anusaar, prabhaavvaad ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he

 The film uses two size ratios, starting at 2
35: 1 when the Walt Disney Pictures logo and Enchanted Storybook are shown, and then switches to the smallest size ratio of 1
85: 1 for the first animated sequence
 It does
 film 2
35:1 main waapas switch kar jaati he jab film live-ection main aa jaati he or uske baad phir switch nahin karti, yahaan tak ki baaki ke bache cartoon anukram main bhi
 lima live-ection or anemeshan anukram donon ke nirdesan ko dekhte hai jiskaa nirmaan ek hi samay main kiya gaya tha
 Enchanted took about two years to complete

 Out of the film's 107 minutes of play time, about ten minutes out of 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film
 lima ne film main digni ichonic kalpana ke har ansh ko bharsak daalane kii koshish kii he jo ve pehle das minute main kar sakate the or jise unhone parmparit cell anemation main sliping biuty, cidrela or snow white and da seven dawarphs jaise purv digni pariyon kii kahani par aadhaarit filmon ko ek shradhanjali ke rup main diya he
 It was the first Disney film to be released on screen in the US with features of traditional cell animations after the Puh Hefatamp movie
 haalanki yah film purv digni filmon se kathavstu ke aadhaar par kaaphi alag thi or is film main ould yeler, da shaigi dog, da swiss family robinsan, bone voyaj or sevej sam jaise atyant puraane anya digni filmon spasht rup se shradhanjali di gai he
 Since the rapid growth of computer graphics in the late 1990s led to the dismantling of most Disney cell animation artists, the animation was not completed in 13 minutes at home but was performed in the Padnesa-based independent company James Baxter Animation, which The notable pioneering animator was started by James Baxter
 bextor ne walt digni feechar anemation ke liye pehle kaam kiya tha or kai yaadgaar digni anemated charitron jaise jesica ribit, bel, rafiki or kasimodo ko asal jindagi main laayaa
 Although Lima wanted animations reminiscent of the past, he wanted Enchanted to have a style of its own
 bextor kii team ne art noviyo kaa istemaal praarambhik bindu ke rup main karne kaa faisla kiya
 Lima brought costume designer Mona May during the first phase of filmmaking to maintain continuity between the two media channels so that costumes from both the animated and live-action worlds were lined up
 unhone saath hi anemetaro dwaara sanket ke rup main istemaal karne ke liye gijela ke rup main emi adams ke kuch live-ection dshyon ko shoot kiya, jo donon duniya ke charitron ke bahya gatividhiyon ko sumelan kii anumati bhi detaa he
 After the completion of the test scenes by the animators, the actors are shown so that they know how their animations move
 principal photography kii shuruuaat april 2006 main hui
 All the live-action scenes were filmed in New York City due to the live-action sequence
 haalanki, neuyork main shooting karnaa kathinyeepurn ho gaya tha kyonki vah "nae store, machaan or marammat kii satat sthiti main tha
 " new york ke pehle drishy main gijela times squer ke madhya ke ek manhole se baahar aati he, is drishy kaa filmakan squer ke bich vaale sthaan se kiya gaya tha
 During the filming in Times Square, ordinary pedestrians appear on the ground in excess of the fare in the immediate foreground due to difficulties in controlling the crowd
 isi tarah times squer main james marden or timothy spal ke drishyon kii shooting ke dauraan unhen dekhne ke liye kaaphi bheed ikattha ho gai thi
 However, the scene that Lima found most challenging was the musical tune, "that's How You Know" in Central Park
 The five-minute scene took 17 days due to weather changes, with only seven days of sunshine for the filming of the scene
 patric dempse ke prashansakon dwaara bhi filmakan main baadha utpann hui thi
 The song was choreographed by John o'connell who worked on Moulin Rouge
 inhone is drishy ke liye atirikt 300 or 150 nartakon ko shaamil kiya
 Many scenes were also filmed at Steiner Studios, providing three large stages with the same type of facilities Enchanted wanted
 anya bahari lokation main brukaleen brij or da paterno, vakr ke saath ek apartment building, behad sundar, gajadant-rang, jo ki riverside drive ke kinare or 116wein street par sthit he or jo film ke charitra robert or morgan philip kaa nivas sthaan he
 All the costumes in this film have been designed by Mona May, who has previously worked on Cliveless, The Wedding Singer and The Hunted Mention
 veshbhusha taiyaar karne ke liye me apane costum department ke 20 logon ke saath purv-nirmaan ke anemetaron ke saath ek varsh kaam kii, jabaki usne los angeles or new york ke paanch poshaak dukaanon ko theka diya
 She joined the project during a time when animators began designing characters' faces and bodies, as they "had to transfer costumes from two-dimensional images of live-action human proportions"
 Originally her goal was to produce Disney-clad clothing but also to make them a little fashion-oriented and funny and to invent something new in this area
 haalanki me ne yah sweekaar kiya ki yah bahut mushkil he "kyonki ichonic digni charitron ke saath prastuti kar rahe the, jo lambe samay se darshakon main apni ek chhavi banaai hui thi
 Her attire for Giselle's character to become a real woman is reflected in her attire, as the film progresses as her costumes become less like fairies
 film kii shuruyaat main uske shaadi ke vastra or film ke ant main uske aadhunik ball goun ekadam vipareet he
 The wedding attire is "very different from flat pictures" and makes the Disney princess image more pronounced
 qamar ko patala pradarshit karne ke kram main uske haathon ke kapade kaa dizin "atirikt pauphi" kiya gaya he or skirt ko jitna ho saktaa tha utana lanbaa kiya gaya he, jisamen peticot or jhaalar ke 20 paraton kaa ek metal gheraa shaamil hai
 Altogether 11 versions of the costume were produced for filming, each of 200 yards of silk satin and other fabrics and weighing approximately 40 pounds
 emi adams ne shaadi kii poshaak pahanane ke apane anubhavon kaa varnan karti hui use bhayanak bataaya he, kahati hai "kapadon kaa puraa vajan nitamb par hota tha, isiilie kabhi-kabhi khinchaav sa mahasoos karti thi"
 Unlike Giselle, Prince Edward does not change in the real world, and James Marsden, who played Edward, designed only one costume
 me kaa uddeshy tha ki " ke outfit banane main apane paagalpan ko khone nahin dena


 jisase vah kabhi bhi sundar lage
 poshaak main "chaati, nitamb or jaangh evam dhad ke jod ke kshetron main anaavashyak vistaar karnaa bhi shaamil he, jo marden ke anemated charitra main bhi samaan rup se aakaar detii he" or "mudra - uski peeth sidhi, baanhen oonchi or kabhi na girane vaali hoti hai
 " me ko khushi he ki lima susan sarandon ke queen naarisa ke saath "kuch zyaada fashanparast ko chunaa"
 usne use "ranve mahila" kii tarah dikhaane kaa nirnay liya kiya, phir bhi usne "kuch digni" kii tarah pahana tha lekin "jon geliano yaa thiari mugler kii dizin kii tarah vah fishan parast bhi tha
 Since Narissa appears in three types of communication mediums: 2D animation, live-action and computer animation, May had to ensure that the entire film should have the same type of costume based on color, shape, and texture
 The dress for Narissa was of the same type as a leather bra and skirt, which looked like a "snake" as well as a necklace
 anemator ke saath kaam karte samay me ne dregon rup ke kuch bhaagon ko poshaak main shaamil kar liya tha; gale ke vastra kaa dizin pankhons kii tarah kiya, skirt aavaran ke paraton kaa dizin poonch kii tarah kiya gaya or ek mukut ko banaaya gaya tha jo narisa ke dregon main antaran hone se vah sing main tabadil ho jaataa tha
 The score for the film was written by excellent lyricist and composer Alan Menken, who has previously worked in several Disney films
 saathi sangeetkaar stephen shavartz ne chah gaanon ke liye geet likhaa, jisaki rachana menkan ne bhi kii thi
 Menken and Schwartz have worked together on songs from Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame
 film nirmaan ke shuruaati charan main hi menkan film main shaamil ho gaye the or shavartz ko unke sahyog ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 He began the songwriting process by searching for the exact moment in the story where the lyrics were acceptable
 shavartz ne paaya tha ki duusare live-ection sangitamay filmon se enchented kii sthitiyon ko nyyochit tehraana kaaphi aasaan he jisamen charitra gaanon main kho jate hai kyonki isaki avadharana "charitron ko gaanaa gane kii anumati detii he jo ki katha kii kathanak se mahatvapurn rup se judi hui he
 "the three songs that Giselle sings refer to earlier Disney films
 film kaa pehla geet "tru lav kish", jiske dauraan digni abhinetriyaan prem kiye jane kii khushi ko abhivyakt karti hai, kaa nirmaan un anemated filmon kii shaileyon, ko ubharti hai or ek shradhanjali arpit karti hai, jiske naam hai ai em vishing or e dream ij e vish yor heart mex 
 yah menkan or shavartz ke liye ek chunauti tha kyonki us gane ke saath kai purv avadharanaen judi hui thi, isamen snow white and da seven dawarphs or syndrella kii samay seemaa kii jhalak honi chahie thi
 Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in the operetta style, in contrast to later Broadway-style songs
 "happy varking sang or "dats haau yu no" dono gane purv digni geet ko bhi shradhanjali arpit karte hai
 "happy Working Song", "wish While You Work", "the Work Song", "A Spoonful of Sugar" and Paying Tributes to songs such as Making Christmas, while "that's How You Know" is a selfie for the Disney film
 Is a parody of the composition of the song, especially the big production songs like "under the Sea" and "be Our Guest"
 ise praapt karne ke liye shavartz ne yah mana ki clasik walt digni samvedansheeltaa ko banaae rakhane ke liye unhen "shabdon or kuch geeton ke chunaav kii drushti se ise thodaa aage le janaa tha" 
 haalanki, menkan ne kahaaki jo gaanaa unhone digni ke liye likhaa he vah hameshaa "thodi vyangyatmak" hoti he
 As the film progresses, more contemporary styles have been used in the music, which can be seen in the adult song "so Close" and the country / pop song "ever After"
 menkan or shavartz dwaara likhi sampurna chah gaanon main se paanch gane film ko samaapt karte hai
 The song, titled "enchanted", is a duet filmed on Idina Menzel and James Marsden, the song has been cut from the film

 This meant that the animators had to demonstrate Pip's emotions as well as to make him appear like a real squirrel
 tippet par team ne jinda gilahari ko dhyaan se dekhte hue pip ke liye anemating prakriya kii shuruuaat kii jisamen "prayek kalpaneey kone" se iskaa filmakan kiya gaya tha, uske baad unhone 3D computer graphics software maaya or furosius kaa istemaal karte hue ek chhavi-sadrush gilahari banaaya

 chehre kaa bhav badhaane ke liye gadhane waalon ne pip ke saath bhunhe ko jod diya tha jo vaastavik gilahari main nahin hota
 During the filming of the scenes in which Pip appears, several methods were used to indicate Pip's physical presence
 kuch avasaron par drishyon main ek taar hathiyaar ke saath ek choti gilahari ko andar rakhaa gaya tha
 In other situations, a wooden end with a small marker or laser pointer was used to show the actors and cinematographers where the pip was
