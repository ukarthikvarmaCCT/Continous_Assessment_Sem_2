 We have always been a very close family because it was a huge shock
 i had years so i could be at home with him
 That missed the first pair of Tests in England
 It was clearly the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were probably some of the most beautiful
 It gave me a chance to say thank you and goodbye
 After a while i think how fortunate it was to do that
 If you are taken away from a parent before that time, then it is far harder

 Completed his studies
 medhaavi or pratibhashali hone ke baavjood unhen koi acha rojgaar nahin mila
 What i got was temporary, junior level and the salary was also very low
 is se bachhendri ko niraashaa hui or unhone naukari karne ke bajaay 'nehru institute of mountenearing' course ke liye aavedan kar diya
 Bachendri's life found a new path from here
 1982 main advance camp ke taur par unhone gangotri or rudugaira kii chadhaai ko puraa kiya
 In this camp, Bachendri was given the first job as instructor by Brigadier Gyan Singh

 Wax coating is the modern way of keeping fruits and vegetables safe for long time, but consider it different from presentation
 iskaa prayog visheshkar parivahan ke samay falon or subjiyon ko sadane or galane se bachaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 a type of edible wax is used in this
 is khaadya mom kii ek maheen part falon or subjiyon ke chhilake ke upar chadhaai jaati he
 Due to this, these fruits, etc
, survive the effects of weather for eight to twelve days and do not rot or rot
 yah mom swasthya par bhi pratikul prabhaav nahin daalata he, yadi khaadya mom hi prayog kiya gaya he
 According to a survey only about 65 percent of agricultural products reach the markets, the rest become spoiled during transportation
 is prakaar kisaanon ke laabh main bhi fark padataa he, va duusari ore ye falon ke mulve kii vruddhi karata he
 The food grade wax used for this process is the semperfresh, so that its freshness is maintained for several days by coating on fruits and vegetables
 falon or subjiyon par part chadhaane kaa yah bahut sasta tarika he
 Ordinary wax coating was offered only on fruits and vegetables that had thick peels, such as gourd, trumpet, etc
, but the new wax semperfresh available in the market could be mounted on any kind of peeled fruits and vegetables
 cemprafresh se part chadhaane ke liye usamen olic acid or trythelal amine kaa mishran banaate hai
 Then the solution is sprayed on fruits and vegetables
 anya khaadya mom kii part chadhaane ke liye subjiyon ko mom ke pichley ghol main dubaakar nikaal liya jaataa he or ise chaaya main sookhaa liya jaataa he
 Vegetables do not get moldy quickly due to this process
 yahaan ye dhyanyogy he, ki cemprafresh kii part chadhaane ke baad bhi falon or subjiyon ko chaaya main sukhaana utana hi aavashyak hota he
 Thus, it is a better way to avoid heavy losses to farmers due to inconvenience of maintenance and transportation

 The cost of offering this layer of wax on fruits and vegetables is about 15-15 paise per kg
 iske alaava is part ko chadhaane ke baad falon main chamak bhi aa jaati he, jo graahakon ko lubhaati hai
 In agricultural research, it has been found that by adding a layer of Kanareva wax, the brightness of the vegetables is increased, along with keeping them in the store for a long time by keeping the moisture intact, farmers can avoid the compulsion to sell them at one-and-a-half prices
 
 maanak mom kii part ke alaava anya saste uplabdh mom swasthya ke liye hanikaarak bhi ho sakate hai
 Among these, especially from fruits coming from abroad, etc
 should be careful

 After this Chandrabardai and Prithviraj also surrendered by stabbing each other in the stomach
 yah ghatana bhi vasant panchami vaale din hi hui thi
 Vasant Panchami also has a deep connection with Veer reality in Lahore
 ek din jab mullah ji kisi kaam se vidhyalay chhodkar chale gayi, to sab bachche khilne lage, par vah padhata rahaa
 When the other children teased her, Durga's mother sang
 muslim baalkon ne durga maa kii hansi udayi

 He stayed in Ranjit Singh's army for some time, then came home and got engaged in farming, but due to spiritual instincts, people started listening to his sermons
 dhire-dhire inke shishyon kaa ek alag panth hi ban gaya, jo kuka panth kahalaaya
 Guru Ram Singh used to place great emphasis on cow protection, Swadeshi, women salvation, inter-caste marriage, mass marriage etc
 unhone bhi sarvapratham angreji shashan kaa bahishkar kar apni swatantra dak or prashasan vyavastha chalaayi thi
 Every year a fair was held in Bhaini village on Makar Sankranti
 1872 main meley main aate samay unke ek shishy ko musalamaanon ne gher liya
 They beat him and slaughtered him and put beef in his mouth
 yah sunakar guru ramsingh ke shishy bhadak gayi
 They attacked that village, but the British army came from the other side

 Many Kuka Veer martyrs were killed in this struggle and 68 were captured

 The remaining 18 were hanged the next day

 Due to this main difference, these two associations formed
 pracheen jain sutron main saat nihnvon kaa ullekh miltaa he, inamen se do nihnav to mahavir ke jivan-kaal main hi utpann ho gaye the
 The founder of the first Nihnava named Bahurat was Jamali, son-in-law of Lord Mahavira himself, a resident of Kshatriyakund village; Mahavira is believed to have originated in Shravasti after 14 years of attaining enlightenment
 jamaali kii manyata thi ki kisi kaary ko purna hone main bahut samay lagata he, ek samay main vah purna nahin hota, atev kriyman ko krit nahin kiya ja saktaa

 The tradition of Jain settlements after Mahavir Bhagwan shows that there was not much difference between the Digambara and the Svetambara tradition till the time of Acharya Bhadrabahu
 isvi san kii pratham shatabdi ke aasapaas ye dono paramparaayen judi pad gai 
 The following are the main differences between the two sects - digambar sampradaay main moksh ke liye nagnatv ko mukhya bataaya gaya hai, jab ki shwetambar moksh paane ke liye nagnatv ko aavashyak nahin maanate
 Digambara prohibits female liberation, in the Shvetambara tradition, the 19th Tirthankar Mallinath has been accepted as Mallikumari
 digambar shwetambar sampradaay dwaara maanya aagam-granthon ko pramanik nahin maanate
 In the Digambara sect, omniscient God does not perform Kavalahar only when he becomes a scientist

 It seems that even after being a Chaityavasi or a monk, the Digambara Sadhus used to remain naked, but later on, there was a tendency to wear clothes
 vikram kii 16veen shatabdi ke vidvan shrutasagar ne likhaa he ki kalikaal main mlechh aadi yatiyon ko nagn avasthaa main dekhakar updrav karte hai isaliye mandapdurg main shrivasantakirti swami ne upadesh diya ki muniyon ko charya aadi ke samay chataayee, taat aadi se sharir ko dhak lenaa chahie or charya ke baad chataayee aadi ko utaar dena chahie

 Lalitkirti, the General President of the Karkal Math, was a similar Bhattarak who was present in 1907
 chaityavasiyon kaa virodh karne ke liye jo kaam vidhimarg ke vidwaanon ne shwetambar sampradaay main kiya, vahi kaam chaityavasi bhattarakon kaa virodh karne ke liye digambar sampradaay teraa panth ne kiya
 Followers of this creed believe in adherence to rigid rules since ancient times and accept true monks who live in the forest
 san 1626 main pandit banarsidas ne agra main jis shuddh amnaay kaa prachaar kiya vahi aage chalakar teraa panth ke naam se prasiddh hua
 When the name Thirteen Panth became prevalent, the way of Bhattarakas came to be called Beas Panth
 sthankavaasiyon ke terapanth se ise bhinn samajhnaa chahie
 In addition to this, similar to the Svetambaras, sub-sects are found in the Digambaras as idolatrous and immortal

 This cult was founded by Taranaswamy
 is panth ke anuyaayi taransvami dwaara rachit 14 granthon ko vedi par sthapit kar unki puja karte hai

 Kailashchandra Shastri, a learned scholar of Jain philosophy, the pagan opposition of Muslims is also a reason for the rise of cults like Taranpanath and Sthanakwasi

 Above all the bunches is a shriupajya; He gives his decision regarding the Chaturmas etc

 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has done so much work for Hindi literature that he became more an institution than a person
 unhone maanas sukhthawali, sankshipt ramayana, hindi nibandhmala, sankshipt padmavali or hindi niabandh ratnavali kaa sampaadan bhi kiya
 He prepared high level text books for the students
 is tarah kii paathya pustakon main bhashaa saar sangrah, bhashaa patrabodh, pracheen lekhamala, hindi patr-lekhan, alok chithran, hindi primer, hindi kii pehali pustak, hindi grammer, hindi sangrah, government of india, balak vinod, nutan-sangrah, anulekh maala, hindi reader, hindi sangrah, hindi kusum sangrah, hindi kusumavali, hindi-suman, hindi proj sillection, gadhy ratnavali, sahitya pradeep, hindi gadhy kusumavali, hindi praveshika padyavali, hindi gadhy sangrah, saahitiyik lekh 
 Shyam Sundar Das was active in literary service till the last moment of his life
 swatantraaa se thik pehle or baad kii hindi kii puri peedi hi babuji ke kandhon par baithkar hi badi hui
 From time to time, the number of his statements given in conferences on various subjects are countless
 is samast chintan par drushti daalane par yah spasht ho jaataa he ki ve kis tarah hindi sahitya ko anek vishyon se jodakar aage badhanaa chaahate the
 Even today Babuji's great contribution is the authentic composition of the text and the wisdom of the field of study
 vidhyaarthiyon ke liye tazaa saamagree laane ke unke har kshan ke prayaas kaa nateeja yah hua ki ve sangrahakaar banate rahe
 It is criticized that this is why his writing became profound and lacked originality
 lekin dekhne kii baat yah he ki unki samanvayvaadee buddhi anek gyaan- kshetron kii saamagree-sangrah main nimagn rahi
 Even in practical-criticism, Babuji established the beauty of harmony

 babu shyaam sundar das kii bhashaa shuddh saahitiyik hindi he, jisamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he
 In relation to the language, his idea was - 'when we accept foreign words with foreign expressions, then make them so that the foreignness comes out of them and they become disciplined by our grammar rules
 ' isliye jahaan kahin unhone apni bhashaa main 'urdu' ke prachlit shabdon kaa prayog kiya he, vahaan unka urdupan nikaal diya he, kalam, kavayad, kanoon aadi shabdon ke neeche kii bindi hataakar or unke uccharan badal kar unhone unka prayog liya he
 Similarly, by removing the rarity of Sanskrit words, they are written in Hindi in a simple way - like work in place of work, anjan in place of anjan
 shabd chayan ke bare main babu shyamsundar das kaa mat tha- 'sabase pehla sthaan shuddh hindi ke shabdon ko, uske peeche sanskrit ke sugam or prachlit shabdon ko, iske peeche farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke saadhaaran or prachlit shabdon kaa or sabase peeche sanskrit ke aprachlit shabdon ko sthaan diya jaae
 Never use difficult words in foreign languages like Persian

 2
 gaveshnatmak style- gaveshnatmak nibandhon main gaveshnatmak style kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The sentences are relatively few long
 bhashaa ke tatsam shabdon kii adhikta he
 Due to the intensity and dryness of the subject it is somewhat dry and devoid of style
 is prakaar kii style kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- 'this life struggle is beginning to seem even more intense and painful due to the attrition of two different civilizations
 is avasthaa ke anukool hi jab sahitya utpann hokar samaaj ke mastishk ko protsaahit or prati kriyman karegaa tabhi vaastavik unnati ke lakshan dekh padenge or uskaa kalyankari fal desh ko aadhunik kaal kaa gaurav pradaan karegaa
 Decoration of ornaments is not found in any type of style of Babu Shyam Sunderdas

 ramchandra shukla ne hindi sahitya kaa itihaas main likhaa he : Shyam Sundar Das was not only an institute-maker, but was also unmatched in management
 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie
 Prior to Shyam Sundar Das there was a particularly critical time for Hindi and Nagari script
 pratap narayan mishra ne kai sthanon par hindi ke prachaar ke liye sabhaayen sthapit kii thim
 One such meeting was established in 1884 in Prayag under the name of 'hindi Savarni Pratik Madhya Bharat Sabha'
 sarkari dacrataron main nagari ke pravesh ke liye bhaaratendu harishchandra ne bhi kai baar udhyam kiya, par unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Despite this, the effort continued
 adalati bhashaa urdu hone ke kaaran navshikshiton main urdu padhane waalon kii sankhya adhik thi, jisase hindi pustakon ke prakaashan kaa kaary aage nahin bad paata tha
 In addition to this literature-crisis, the entry of Nagari into the government offices was a grave crisis in front of people who knew it
 isi daur main kuch utsaahi chaatro ke udyog se, jinamein babu shyaam sundar das pramukh the, 1893 main kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha kii sthapana kii gayi
 Here too, remember the statement of Ramchandra Shukla that, 'tell me the truth, all the prosperity and fame of this gathering is the fruit of Babu Shyam Sundar Das's sacrifice and continuous hard work
 ve aadi se ant tak iske pranaswaroop sthit hokar baraabar ise anek bade udyogon main tatpar karte rahe
 Its first chairman was Bharatendu's brother-in-law Radhakrishna Das
 ’ nagari prachaar ke andolan ne hindi-premiyon main nayaa utsaah paidaa kiya or bahut se log sahitya kii shrivriddhi main samarpit bhav se lag gayi

 Politics gateway pakistan kaa samvidhan pakistan) yaa dasture pakistan urdu: دستور پاکستان ) ko 1973 kaa kaanoon bhi kehete hai
 It is the highest court of Pakistan
 pakistan kaa samvidhan samvidhan sabha dwaara 10 april 1973 ko paarit hua tathaa 14 agast 1973 se prabhavi hua
 The draft was formulated by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's government and the opposition
 ye pakistan kaa teesraa dastur he or is main kai baar raddobadal kii ja chuki he
 After the constitution was changed in India in 1950, Pakistan's lawmakers stepped up efforts to establish their constitution
 pradhanmantri mohammad ali or unki sarkaar ke adhikariyon ne desh main vipakshi dalon ke sahyog ke saath pakistan ke liye ek samvidhan taiyaar karne ke liye kaam kiya
 Finally, because of this joint work, the first set of constitutions was implemented
 yah ghatana 23 march 1956 ko hui thi,is din ko aaj bhi pakistan ke samvidhan ke pravartan ke uplakshya main ganatantraa diwas manaata he
 This constitution provided Pakistan with a "unicameral legislature" parliamentary system of government
 saath hi, isane aadhikarik taur par pakistan ko ek islamic ganraajya ghoshit bhi kiya
 Furthermore, in it, the principle of parity was also introduced for the first time
 samvidhan dwaara, iskundar mirza ne adhyaksh pad grahan kiya, lekin rashtriya maamalon main unki lagaataar asanvaidhanik bhagidaari ke kaaran, chaar nirvaachit pradhanmantriyon ko maatr do saalon main hi barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Under public pressure, President Iskandar Mirza upheld the coup in 1958; And thus this constitution was almost suspended
 sheeghra hi baad main general ayub khan ne iskundar mirza apdasth or khud ko raashtrapati ghoshit kar diya
 And so this constitution was able to run only for 3 years
 17 farvari 1960, ko ayub khan ne desh ke bhavishya ke raajnneetik dhaanche par report karne ke liye ek ayog kii niyukti kii
 The commission was formed with ten other members headed by former Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mohammad Shahabuddin
 isamen purvi pakistan se paanch sadsy or paanch pashchimi pakistan se bhi paanch sadsy the
 It was composed entirely of retired judges, lawyers, industrialists and landlords
 is samvidhan ayog kii report ko 6 may 1961 ko raashtrapati ayub ke samaksh prastut kii gai or raashtrapati or unke mantrimandal dwaara jaanch ke pashchaat janvari 1962 main, cabinet ant main nae samvidhan ke mul paath ko manjuuri de di gai
 It was implemented by President Ayub on 1 March 1962 and finally came into effect on 8 June 1962
 yah samvidhan nihit 250 lekh baarah bhaagon or teen kaarykram main baanta gaya tha
 Like the previous constitution, it also talked about building Pakistan on Islamic values and keeping a unicameral legislature
 parantu 1956 ke samvidhan ke mukaable is samvidhan kii pariyojnaon ke mutabik pakistan ke raashtrapati ko anek karyadhikaar diye gaye the, or multah ek adhyakshiya vyavastha gathit kii gai thi
 Like the constitution of 1956, the constitution of 1962 did not last long
 pakistan main doosraa marshall lau, 26 march 1969 ko lagaaya gaya tha jab raashtrapati ayub khan ne 1962 main samvidhan niraakrit kiya or sena ke commander-in-chif general aagaa mohammad yahya khan ko satta saunp diya
 Upon assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan overthrew the one-unit system on popular demand in West Pakistan and ordered a general election on the principle of one man one vote
 1970 ke sanvaidhanik sankat ke baad nai sarkaar ke liye sabase mahatvapurn kaaryon main se ek ek nae samvidhan kaa masauda taiyaar karnaa tha
 After the partition of East Pakistan in 1971, 1972 the legislature was formed on the basis of the 1970 elections
 ek samiti vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke paar anubhag se sthapit kii gai
 The purpose of this committee was to create a constitution in the country, on which all political parties agree
 samiti ke andar ek antar yah tha ki kya desh main sansadeey satta pranali honi chahie yaa raashtrapati pranali
 Apart from this there were different views on the issue of provincial autonomy
 sanvaidhanik samiti ne apni report taiyaar karne main aath maheene kiye, antat 10 april 1973 ko samiti ne, samvidhan ke bare main apni report pesh kii
 It was adopted with a majority of 135 positive votes in the federal assembly and on 14 August 1973, this constitution was implemented in Pakistan
 pakistani samvidhan main baarah bhaag or paanch anusuchiyaan hai, iske alaava samvidhan ke prastaavna ke rupamen objactives rezolution ko bhi, bataur purkansh, 1985 main joda gaya he
 Apart from this, there are 21 amendments to the constitution, which have been added to the constitution on different occasions
 samvidhan ke bhinn-bhinn lekhon ko samvidhan ke nimnlikhit bhaagon main baanta gaya he: Schedules are information provided in the constitution that categorizes and tabulates government policy and bureaucratic activities: pakistan ke peeche samvidhanon main die gaye praavdhaanon ke viruddh is samvidhan main sanshodhan pakistan ki sansad kii manjuuri se hi laayaa ja saktaa he maujuuda kanoon ke anusaar sanshodhan ke liye prastaav sansad ke donon sadanon main do-tihaai bahumat se paarit hona chahie
 In addition, treaty-related resolutions also have to be passed in the provincial legislatures
