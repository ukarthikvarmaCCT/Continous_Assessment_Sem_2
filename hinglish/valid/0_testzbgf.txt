 Some gases are made for fuel
 aisi gaison ko "taapan gas" kehete hai
 Both types of gases are "dahm gases"
 inhen "audyogic gas" bhi kehete hai
 In 1792, Murdoch of England laid the foundation of the gas industry, when he said that gas can be used to produce light

 marudgan ek devgan kaa naam
 In the Vedas, he is written as the son of Rudra and Vrishni and his number is considered three times 60; But in the Puranas, he is written as the son of Kashyapa and Diti, who was cut by one of his pregnant brothers Indra by cutting the womb into forty-nine pieces, who died forty-nine
 vedon main marudagan kaa sthaan antariksh likhaa he, unke ghode kaa naam 'prishit' batalaaya he tathaa unhen indra kaa sakha likhaa he
 In the Puranas, they have been considered as the angels of the wind

| devataaon ne phir asuron ko parajeet karke unhen samaapt kar diya |diti ko apane putron kii mrityu se bahut dukh or krodh hua |unhone apane pati ke paas ja kar kaha ki aapke putron ne mere putron kaa vadh kiya he, is liye tapasya karke aise putr ko praapt karnaa chaahati hoon jo indra kaa vadh kar sake | kashyap ne kaha ki tumhe pehle 1000 varshon tak pavitrataa purvak rahanaa hoga tab tum mujhase indra kaa vadh karne main samarth putr praapt kar logi |yah kah kar kashyap ne diti kaa sparsh kiya or diti bhi prasann ho kar apane pati ke kahe anusaar tap karne chali gayi | diti ko tap karata dekh indra bhi unki seva karne lage | jab tap samaapti main 1 varsh baaqi rahaa tap diti ne indra se kaha ki ek varsh baad jab tumhaare bhai kaa janm hoga tab wo tumhe maarane me samarth hoga par tumne meri tap me itani seva kii he ki main use tumko maarane ke liye na kahuungi | Both of you to rule together
 After this, Diti blinked during the day and her head started going to the feet, which polluted her body and dissolved her tenacity
 Here Indra was also worried about the defeat of Diti's son and decided to end the pregnancy
 Indra cut this womb into 7 pieces
 When Diti woke up, when he came to know about the seven pieces of the womb, he told Indra that due to the dissolution of my tenacity, my womb has broken into pieces, there is no fault of you
 Diti then said that even after being cut, these pieces of my womb will always move in the sky and will be known as Marut
 These seven will be the seven Ganas of Marut who can roam around seven places and thus a total of 49 Marutas are made

 Tukojirao Holkar was the commander of the first Ahilyabai Holkar and became the ruler of the Holkar dynasty after his death
 doordarshita ke abhaav tathaa prabal mahatvakankshavash isane mahadji shinde se yuddh mol liya tha tathaa antat purnroopen parajeet hua tha
 From the time of Bajirao I, 'shinde' and 'holkar' were the two main pillars of the Maratha Empire
 ranoji scindia evam malharav holkar shivaji maharaj ke sarvapramukh saradaaron main se the, lekin in donon pariwaron kaa bhavishya saamaanya sthiti vaala nahin rah paaya
 All the successors of Ranoji Shinde were well qualified while the family situation of Malharrao Holkar became unfortunate
 unke putr khanderao ke durbhagyapurna ant ke pashchaat ahilyabai holkar ke stri tathaa bhakthibhaav purna mahila hone se dwaidh shashan sthapit ho gaya
 The capital had Ahilyabai Holkar as the nominal ruler and appointed Tukoji Holkar as the chief executive officer for military operations
 kosh par ahilyabai apana kathor niyantran rakhti thi tathaa tukoji holkar kaaryvahak adhikari ke rup main unki ichchhaaon tathaa adeshon ke paalan ke liye abhiyaanon evam anya kaaryon kaa sanchaalan karata tha
 Ahilyabai was more busy in devotion and charity and could not pay special attention to upgrade the army according to the time requirements
 tukoji holkar atyadhik mahatvakankshi parantu aviveki vyakti tha
 Initially he was an ally with Mahadji in Maratha campaigns
 tab tak uski sthiti bhi apekshaakrit sudrudh rahi
 The defeat of the British army between Bargaon and Talegaon by Peshwa Madhavrao Narayana, the surrender of Raghunathrao and Tukoji Holkar with Mahadji in the victory of the Marathas was also a small but satisfactory part
 san 1780 main tukoji mahadji se alag ho gaya
 After that Mahadji achieved great advancement in the political field and Tukoji's place was greatly reduced
 vastutah tukoji main doordarshita kaa abhaav tha
 He was like a puppet in the hands of his subordinates and secretaries
 visheshtah uske sachiv naroshankar kaa us par anargal prabhaav tha
 For these reasons, despite being the chief caretaker of Ahilyabai, Ahilyabai herself did not trust him much
 lalsot ke sangharsh ke baad 1787 main mahadji dwaara sahaayta bheje jane ke anurodh par naanaa fadanvis ne pune se ali bahadur tathaa tukoji holkar ko bheja tha; parantu ek to in donon ne pahunchne main atyadhik samay lagaaya or phir pahunchakar bhi mahadji se vaimnasy utpann kar liya
 Tukoji was seeking a share in the conquered provinces, and Mahadji naturally said that if he wanted a share, he should also share the money spent for the first victory
 rajput sangh dwaara utpann mahadji ke kashton ko dur karne ke sthaan par tukoji ne unke shatruon kaa paksh liya tathaa mahadji ke prayatnon ko nirbal banane main yogadan diya
 In fact Tukoji was just a drunk alcoholic soldier
 prashasan ke kaaryon main mukhyatah vah apane shadyantrkaari sachiv naaron ganesh ke haathon kaa khilonaa banakar hi rah gaya tha
 Ahilyabai and Tukoji, who were often equals, could never live with equal opinions
 ahilyabai ne tukoji ko padchyut karne kaa bhi praytn kiya parantu unke parivaar main koi anya vyakti aisa tha bhi nahin jo ki sena kaa niyantran sambhaal saktaa
 Thus, Ahilyabai remained in control of the treasury and Tukoji Holkar faced starvation in military campaigns
 tukoji holkar ke chaar putr the-- kashirao, malharav, vithoji tathaa yashwantrao
 Of these, the first two were sons and the last two were Anuras

 There was no real power or scope left for Holkar to consume

 In August 1790, Mahadji celebrated in Mathura methodically to accept the royal decree by which he was appointed the sole state representative of the empire

 All the feudatories attended this court except Tukoji
 tukoji ne is darbar main bhaag lenaa asweekaar kar ke ek prakaar se mahadji kaa saarvajanik apmaan kiya tha
 Tukoji was constantly ignoring the orders of the Peshwa and in 1792 he also raised the chiefs against Shinde

 On 8 October 1792, Gopal Rao Bhau, on behalf of Mahadji, made a surprise attack on Holkar at a place called Suravali
 anek sainik maare gaye parantu khud tukoji holkar bandi hone se batch gaya
 Although the agreement was reached with the efforts of Bapuji Holkar and Parashar Pant, Ahilyabai in Indore and Malharrao II, the prodigal son of Tukoji, found it humiliating
 bahari duniya se anbhigya hone ke kaaran ahilyabai ne malharav ke ran main adhikarpurvak jane dene ke uddhat prastaav ko manjuuri de di
 He reached the camp of his father with the army and money he wanted, and in violation of the agreement and consultation of Bapuji and Parashar Pant, started an attack on the scattered horsemen of Mahadji

 Tukoji usually remained calm after the said incident
 1795 main nizaam ke viruddh maraathon ke kharda ke yuddh main atyant vriddhavastha main usne bhaag liya tha
 After the demise of Ahilyabai in 1795, Tukoji assumed the title of Indore

 He was unable to take control of his unnamed sons and divided family

 Inter-abdominal vision cholecystectomy has now replaced open cholecystectomy as the first choice of treatment for gallstones and cures for gall bladder, unless dieting in the intra-abdominal vision approach

 16 varsh kii aayu main, arestu se shiksha praapt kar sikandar rajya main waapas aa gaya
 At the same time Philip waged war against Bezantium, leaving Alexander in charge of the kingdom
 philip kii anupasthiti ke dauraan, thresian maidi ne macidonia ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Alexander immediately launched a campaign against him and drove him out of his territory

 Philip returns, sending Alexander there with a small military force to suppress the rebellion in southern Thrace

 While still occupied in Thrace, Philip ordered Alexander to set up an army for an expedition into southern Greece
 kahin anya greek rajya isamen hastkshep na karen, sikandar ne aisa dikhaaya ki vah eliaria par hamalaa karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Illyrias invaded Macedonia, which Alexander drove back
 philip or uski sena 338 isa purv main apane bete se ja mili, or ve dakshin main thermopyle par chadhaai karne ke liye nikal gayi jahaan thabern ki sena ke kade pratirodh ke baad us par kabja kar liya gaya

 Philip then returned to Ilesia, from where he sent a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, which were both rejected
 philip ne dakshin kii ore kooch kii, jahaan uske virodhiyon ne use cheronia, boesia ke paas roak liya
 For the Battle of Charonia, Philip ordered the right line and Alexander with a group of Philip's trusted generals to take over the left line
 pracheen sroton ke anusaar, donon paksh main kuch samay ke liye bhanyakar ladaai hui
 Philip deliberately ordered his troops to retreat, so that the Athenian soldiers could chase and break away from their security line, and they could penetrate it
 sikandar ne sabase pehle thiban ki suraksha panktiyon ko todaa, uske peeche philip ke generalon the, dushman ke saamanjasy ko nuksaan pahunchane ke baad, philip ne apane sainikon ko aage badhane kaa aadesh diya or unhen jaldi gherne kaa aadesh diya
 With Athenian defeated, Thibian survived to fight alone and was surrounded by all fours
 antat: ve haar gaye
 After the victory in Charonia, Philip and Alexander proceeded unopposed to the Peloponnese where they were welcomed by all the cities; However, when they reached Sparta, they were rejected there, but Philip did not resort to war
 kurinth main, philip ne "helinics elliance" kii sthapana kii, jisamen sparta ko chhodkar adhikansh greek shahar-rajya shaamil the
 Philip was named Hégon after this league, and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire
 jab philip pela waapas laut aayaa, to use apane senapati atlus kii bhatiji cleopetra iridiis se pyaar ho gaya or usase vivaah kar liya
 This marriage led to Alexander's claim as heir, as the son born to Cleopatra Irides would have been a complete Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half Macedonian
 vivaah ke bhoj ke dauraan, sharaab ke nashe main atalus ne saarvajanik taur par devataaon se prarthana kii, ki ab macedoniyaan main ek vaid uttaradhikari kaa janm hoga
 Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, leaving her in Dodona, near his maternal uncle, King Alexander i of Epirus
 or khud eliaria chalaa gaya, jahaan usne elian raja se sangrakshan kii maang kii
 Despite being defeated in a battle with Alexander a few years ago, he welcomed Alexander as a guest
 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki philip ne kabhi bhi apane raajnneetijna or sainya prashikshit bete ko asweekaar nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Accordingly, Alexander returns to Macedonia after six months due to the efforts of Demratus, a family friend
 agle varsh main, pixodaras, kaaria ke farsi governor ne apni sabase badi beti ko sikandar ke sautele bhai, philip arhidiyas se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Olympius and many of Alexander's friends suggest that Philip intended to make Erhidius his successor
 sikandar ne pixelrus ko ek doot thisslus ko bhej yah batalaai ki use apni beti kaa haath avaidh bete ko dene ke bajaay sikandar ko dena chaiye
 When Philip heard of this, he stopped the offer negotiations and shouted out to Alexander that he wanted to marry Kyu Pixodarus' daughter, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him
 philip ne sikandar ke chaar mitron harpalus, narkus, tolmi or arygiyas ko nirvasit kar diya, or korinthiens ko thisslus ko zanjeeron main laane ke liye bhej diya
 In the summer of 336 BCE, Philip is assassinated by his bodyguard captain, Posnis, while attending the marriage of his daughter Cleopatra in Ayge
 jab posnis bhaagane kaa prayaas kiya, to sikandar ke do saathi, perdicus or leonatas ne uskaa peechha kar use maar daalaa
 At the same time, at the age of 20, Alexander was declared king by the nobles and the army
 singhaasana sambhalate hi sikandar apane pratidwandviyon ko khatm karne laga
 He started by killing his cousin, the former Amintus Fourth
 usne lancastis kshetra ke do macedonian rajkumaron ko bhi maar diya, halanki tisare, alexander lancastis ko chhod diya
 Olympus burned Cleopatra Iridis and Europa, Philip's daughter, alive

 Alexander also ordered the assassination of Atalus, Cleopatra's uncle and advance commander of the Army of Asia campaign
 atlus us samay athens main apane dosharahit hone kii sambhaavna ke bare main demothens se baatcheet karne gaya tha
 Atalus had insulted Alexander several times, and after Cleopatra's murder, Alexander considered it too dangerous to leave him alive
 sikandar ne arhidiyas ko chhod diya, joki sambhawatah olympiyas dwaara jehar dene ke parinamswaroop, maansik rup se viklang ho chukaa tha
 The news of Philip's death led to rebellions in several states, including Thebes, Athens, Thistle and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon
 jab vidroh kii khabar sikandar tak pahunchi, to usne turant us par dhyaan diya
 Instead of using diplomacy, Alexander marched south towards Thistley, forming a 3,000 Macedonian cavalry
 usne paaya kii thisli kii sena, olympius parvat or osa parvat ke bich ke raste par kabja kiye hue he, usne apni sena ko osa parvat par chadhane kaa aadesh diya
 The next day, when the Thistlean army awoke, Alexander found himself standing behind him with his army, and they immediately surrendered
 sikandar ne unki ghudsavaar sena ko apni main mila kar dakshin main pelloponis kii ore kooch karne laga
 Alexander halted at Thermopile, where he was chosen as the leader of the Amphictyonic League, then proceeded south from there to Corinth
 athens ne shanti ke liye guhaar lagaai, jise sikandar ne maan liya or vidrohiyon ko maaf kar diya
 The famous meeting between Alexander and Diogenes Diogenes the Scenic took place in Corinth
 jab sikandar ne diogens se poocha ki vah unke liye kya kar saktaa he, to darshanik ne ghrinaapurvak se sikandar ko ek taraf khadaa hone ke liye kaha, kyonki vah surya ke prakaash ko avaruddh kar rahaa tha
 Alexander was amused by this spot-on answer, and he said, "if i hadn't been Alexander, i wanted to be Diogenes"
 corinth main, jaise philip ko faras ke khilaaf aane vaale yuddh ke liye commander niyukt kiya gaya tha vaise hi sikandar ko hegaman kaa sheershak diya gaya
 Here he also received news of the Thracian rebellion
 asia ko paar karne se pehle, sikandar apni uttari simaaon ko surakshit karnaa chahta tha
 In the spring of 335 BC, he set out to suppress several rebellions
 ampipolis se shuru hokar, vah "swatantra thresian" ke desh main purv kii ore yatra karata rahaa; or hemas parvat par, macedonian sena ne thresian senaaon ko oonchaaiyon par bhi hamalaa kar parajeet kiya
 Further troops entered the country of Tribali and defeated their forces near the river Laijinus

 Crossing the river at night itself, he surprised them and forced his army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish
 sikandar tak jab yah samachar pahunchi ki celsius, eliaria kaa raja or tyualanti ke raja gluaaki uske khilaaf khule main vidroh karne lage the
 He turned to Illyria in the west, after Alexander defeated them one by one, forcing both rulers to flee with his Saina
 in jeeton ke saath hi, usne apni uttari seemaa ko surakshit kar liya tha
 While Alexander was on his north expedition, he was informed of the rebellion of Thebes and the Athenian once again and Alexander immediately marched south
 jabaki anya shahar sikandar se takaraane main jhijak rahe the, thibs ne ladaai karne kaa faisla kiya
 Thebes' resistance was ineffective, and Alexander overtook them and annexed the city and divided the region among other Bootian cities
 thibs ke ant ne athens ko chup kar diya or asthaayee taur par hi sahi, saare yunaan par shanti aa gai
 Alexander then left his Asian campaign, leaving Antipiter as regent
 spitameness kii mrityu or roksena ke saath uski nai shaadi ke baad, sikandar ne bhartiya upmahadweep ki ore apana dhyaan le gaya
 He invited all the chiefs of Gandhara, and asked them to take his jurisdiction under Alexander

 Ambi went to him with all his army, assuring Alexander of friendship and giving him valuable gifts
 sikandar ne na keval use uskaa pad or uphaaron ko lautaa diya, balki usne ambhi ko "farsi vastra, sone or chaandi ke gahane, 30 ghode or 1,000 sone kii pratibhaaen" uphaar swaroop de diya
 Alexander divided his army, and Ambi helped Hephaestion and Pedricus to build the bridge over the Indus River, as well as supplying food to his soldiers
 usne sikandar or uski puri sena kaa uski rajdhani takshashila shahar main dosti kaa sabase bada pradarshan karte hue sabase udaar aatithy ke saath swaagat kiya
 As Alexander advanced, Taxila took part in the Battle of the Jhelum River, with the help of an army of 5,000 of his men
 is yuddh main vijay ke baad, sikandar ne ambhi ko puruvas se baatcheet ke liye bheja, jisamen poras kaa sara rajya sikadanr ke adheen karne jaisi sharten peshkash kii gai, chunki aambhi or poras puraane dushman the usne sabhi sharten thukraa di or ambhi badi mushkil se apni zindagi bachaa vahaan se bhaag paaya
 However, the two rivals were then reconciled by Alexander to personal mediation; And Takshashila, due to the contribution of equipment and forces to the fleet on the Jhelum, Ambi was assigned the entire area between the Jhelum River and the Indus; He gained more power after the death of Machatus' son Philip; After Alexander's death and subsequent partition of the provinces in Triparadisus in 321 BCE, he was allowed to retain his authority
 327 / 326 isa purv kii sardeeyon main, sikandar ne kunar ghaatiyon kii aspisioi, guruis ghati ke gurani, or swat or buner ghaatiyon ke asenki jaise kshetreey kabilon ke khilaaf ek abhiyaan chalaaya
 a fierce battle ensues with Espacioi in which Alexander's shoulder is wounded by a spear, but eventually Espacioi is defeated
 sikandar ne phir assakenoi kaa saamana kiya, jisane massaga, ora or arons ke gadhon se ladaayeeyaan ladi
 The fort of Massaga was won only after a bloody battle, in which Alexander's ankle was severely injured
 curtius ke anusaar, "na keval alexander ne massaga kii puri aabaadi ko maar daalaa, balki uske sabhi imaaraton ko malbe main badal diya
 "A similar massacre was also carried out in Ora
 massaga or ora ke baad, kai assensian arons ke kile main bhaag gaye
 Alexander followed them and after four days of bloody fighting captured this strategic hill-fort
 arons ke baad, 326 isa purv main sikandar ne sindhu ko paar kiya or raja poras ke khilaaf ek mahayuddh jeeta, jiskaa jhelum or chenab nadi ke bich vaale kshetra par shashan tha, jo ab punjab kaa kshetra kehalaata hai
 Alexander was greatly impressed by Porus's bravery, and made him one of his allies
 usne poras ko apana upapati niyukt kar diya, or uske kshetra ke saath, uske apane jite dakshin-purv main vyas nadi tak ke kshetra ko jod diya

 Reggae is a musical genre that first developed in Jamaica in the 1960s
 Although the name is sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to most forms of Jamaican music, the term reggae actually refers to a particular musical style that arose after the development of ska and rocksteady music styles
 rege ek layaaddh style par aadhaarit he, skank naam se jane jane vaale apaaramparik swaraghaat isaki visheshta he
 Reggae are normally slower than Ska and Rocksteady
 rege aamtaur par prayek baar main duusare or chauthe taal par swarankan karti he, lay guitar ke saath bhi yaa to tisare taal par jor detii he yaa phir jab tak ki chauthaa taal bajaayaa jaay tab tak duusare taal ke swar ko pakde rakhti he
 It is primarily the "third rhythm" that distinguishes reggae from rocksteady due to its tempo and complex bass style, although later genres incorporated these innovations separately
 jamaikai angreji ke shabdkosh ke 1967 ke sanskaran main rege ko "rege ke liye haal hi main sthapit vartanee" ke rup main soochibaddh kiya gaya
 Because the word reggae-reggae can mean either "rag, torn old clothes" or "spangled, quarreled"
 ek sangeet ke naam ke rup main 1968 main pehali baar rege kaa prakaashan hua, jab da meyatles dwaara rockstidi "du da regge " kaa pradarshan kiya gaya
 But the name was already used in Kingston, Jamaica as a slow dance and rocksteady style
 rege kalakaar derick morgan kehete hai: We didn't like the name Rock Steady, so i tried a different version of "fat Man"

 akkhad yuvakon ne jaan-boojhkar apane ska records ko aadhi raftaar main bajaanaa shuru kiya, taaki apni ujjad chhavi ke hisse ke rup main dhimaa nrity kiya ja sake
 By the mid-1960s, many musicians began playing ska at a slower pace, while the emphasis was on walking bass and offbeats

 This phase of Jamaican music only lasted until 1968, when musicians began to revive the tempo of the music's rhythm and began to make more impact

 Reggae are either sung at 4 / 4 time or swing time, since the symmetric rhythmic pattern does not provide itself to other time signatures such as 3 / 4 time
 The accompaniment is often very simple and sometimes an entire song does not exceed one or two vocals

 Smear drums or small drums are often played in very high tone for timbrels-type sound, rather than a standard drum kit commonly used in reggae
