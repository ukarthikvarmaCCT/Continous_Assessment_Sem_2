 bishnoi samaaj uttar bharat kaa ek hindu sampradaay he jisamen shaakaahaari jati ke log he jo jambheshwaraji ke bataae 29 niyam par chalate he 
 There is a very famous saying in this regard, which is as follows- The last heart of the twenty-ninth religion is Joy, Jambhoji Kripa Kari Naam Vishnoi Hoy
 1- pratidin praat:kaal snaan karnaa 2- 30 din janan – sutak maananaa, 3- 5 din rajaswata sree ko grih kaaryon se mukt rakhana, 4- sheel kaa paalan karnaa, 5- santosh kaa dhaaran karnaa, 6- bahari evam aantarik shuddhta evam pavitrataa ko banaaye rakhana, 7- teen samay sandhya upasna karnaa, 8- sandhya ke samay aarti karnaa evam ishwar ke gunon ke bare main chintan karnaa, 9- nishtha evam prempurvak havan karnaa, 10- pani, eendhan va doodh ko chaan-been kar prayog main lenaa, 11- vaani kaa sanyam karnaa, dayaa evam kshamaa ko dhaaran karnaa, 12- chori, ninda, jhooth tathaa vaad–vivaad kaa tyaag karnaa,13- amaavashya ke din vrath karnaa,14-vishnu kaa bhajan karnaa,15- jeevon ke prati dayaa kaa bhav rakhana,16- haraa vriksh nahin katwanaa,17- kaam, krodh, moh evam lobh kaa naash karnaa,18- rasoi apane haadh se bananaa,19- paropkaaree pashuon kii raksha karnaa,20- amal, tambaaku, bhaang, madh tathaa nil kaa tyaag karnaa,21- bail ko badhiya nahin karwaanaa The influence of other religions on Jambhoji's teachings is clearly visible
 unhone jain dharm se ahimsa evam dayaa kaa siddhanth tathaa islam dharm se murdon ko gaadna, vivaah ke samay phere lenaa aadi siddhanth grahan kiye hai
 The Vaishnavism and Nanakpanth also have a major influence on their teachings
 is sampradaay main guru diksha evam holi paahal aadi sanskaar saadhuon dwaara sampadit karawaaye jate hai, jinamein kuch mahant bhi bhaag lete hai
 They are entitled to the seat of the Mahant, the special place, but people from the class called Thapan get naming, marriage and funeral rites performed
 chetavanee likhane evam samarohon ke avasaron par gane bajaane aadi kaaryon ke liye gayan alag hote hai
 When greeted in this community, it is called 'nivana Pranam' for salutation, and 'vishnu Nai Jambhauji Nai' in the scripture
 vishnoi auraten laal or kaali oon ke kapade pahenti hai
 She only wears lacquer bangles
 ve na to badan gudati hai na to daanton par sona chadhaati he
 Vishnoi people do not like to wear blue clothes
 maanate hai
 The sage wears a black ebony garland of sharp jambhoji cap and flat beads coming up to the ear
 mahant praaia: dhoti, kameez or sir par bhagava safa bandhate hai
 Men wear white turbans
 vishnoiyon main shav ko gaadne kii pratha prachlit thi
 Vishnoi sect believes in idol worship
 at: jambhoji ke mandir or sathariyon main kisi prakaar kii murti nahin hoti he
 In some places, members of this community worship the items of Jambhoji
 jaise ki pipasar main jambhoji kii khadaau jodi, mukaam main topi, pichhovedon jangalu main bhiksha paatr tathaa chola evam lohawat main pair ke nishaanon kii puja kii jaati he
 Every day there is havan - bhajan and Vishnu praise and worship, evening work and jambha jagaran are also done
 is sampradaay ke log jaat – paat main vishwaas nahin rakhte
 Therefore, people of both Hindu and Muslim religions accept them
 shri jambh saar lakshya se is baat kii pushti hoti he ki sabhi jatiyon ke log is sampradaay main dikshith hue
 For example, people of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, Telis, Dhobi, Khatis, barbers, Damru, Bhats, Chhipas, most Jats, and Sai etc took initiation in this sect by taking mantra water
 rajasthan main jodhpur tathaa bikaner rajya main badi sankhya main is sampradaay ke mandir or saathriyaan bani hui hai
 The main temple of this sect remains at a place called Mukam
 yahan prativarsh phalgun kii amaavashya ko ek bahut bada mela lagata he jisamen hajaaron log bhaag lete hai
 Among other pilgrimage centers of this community, Jambholav, Peepasar, Sambharathal, Janglu, Lohawar, Lalasar etc
 are particularly notable
 inamen jambholav vishnoiyon kaa tirthraj tathaa sambhrathal mathura or dwarika ke sadrush maane jate hai
 Apart from this, small temples of this community are also built at places like Raisingh Nagar, Padampur, Chak, Pillibanga, Sangaria, Tandoorwali, Sriganganagar, Ridmalsar, Lakhasar, Kolayat, Lamba, Tilvasani, Alay and Pushkar etc
 is sampradaay kaa rajasthan se baahar bhi prachaar hua
 Temples built in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh etc
 confirm this
 jambhoji kii shikshaaon kaa vishnoiyon par bahut adhik prabhaav padaa
 That is why people of this community neither eat meat nor drink alcohol
 iske atirikt ve apni gram kii seemaa main hiran yaa anya kisi pashu kaa shikaar bhi nahin karne dete hai
 Members of this community do not allow animal killing at any cost
 bikaner rajya ke ek paravaane se pataa chalata he ki talwa ke mahant ne deene naamak vyakti se pashu hatya kii ashanka ke kaaran uskaa medhaa chin liya tha
 There was a panchayat in every Vishnoi village to prevent a person from acting against the rules
 niyam viruddh kaary karne vaale vyakti ko yah panchayat dharm se padchyut karne kii ghoshnaa kar detii thi
 For example, in 2001, a person named Babu killed a chicken in Rudkali village, on which the panchayat drove him out of the cult
 gramin panchayaton ke alaava bade paimaane par bhi vishnoiyon kii ek panchayat hoti thi, jo jambholav evam mukaam par yojit hone vaale sabase bade meley ke avasar par baithti thi
 In this, the emphasis was to follow the rules made by this community
 vibhinn melon ke avasar par liye gayi nirnyon se pataa chalata he ki is panchayat kii nirnit baaten or vyavastha kaa paalan karnaa sabhi ke liye anivaary tha or jo vyakti iskaa ulanghan karata tha, use vishnoi samaaj se bahishkrut kar diya jaataa tha
 No person in the village of Vishnoi could cut the green cast of Khejde or Shami tree
 is sampradaay ke jin sree – purushon ne khejade or hare vrikshon ko kaata tha, unhone swechha se atmotsarg kiya tha
 This is confirmed by the literature related to Jambhoji
 rajasthan ke shaskaon ne bhi is sampradaay ko manyata dete hue hameshaa uske dharmik vishwaason kaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 This is the reason that many orders have been given from time to time by the state of Jodhpur and Bikaner to the village pattayats, in which they have been instructed not to cut and hunt in Vishnoi villages
 bikaner ne sanwat 1907 main kasaayiyon ko bakre lekar kisi bhi vishnoi gaanv main se hokar na guzarane kaa aadesh diya
 The rulers of Bikaner state have been given land to Vishnoi temples from time to time
 aise pramaan praapt hue hai ki sujansingh ne mukaam mandir ko 3000 bigha evam jangalu mandir ko 1000 bigha jameen di thi
 Bikaner issued an order in Samvat 1877 and 1887, according to which it was directed not to take anything without offense
 is prakaar jodhpur rajya ke shaasha ne bhi vishnoiyon ko jameen evam lagaan ke sambandh main anek riyaayaten pradaan kii thim
 Maharana Bhim Singh ji and Jawan Singh ji of Udaipur also gave their obedience to keeping dignity and levying taxes as per the earlier tradition of the Vishnois of Jodhpur! =rajasthan kaa rajya pashu chinkaara ek taraf to apni khubsuurati ke kaaran abhijatya logon kii ruchi or taskaron ke nishane par he to duusari taraf ise sarkaar kii berukhi kaa bhi saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Recently its hunting cases have been reported in Barmer and Bikaner districts
 in nirih pashuon kii samasya yah he ki filmi sitaron se lekar sarhad par desh kii raksha karne vaale sainikon tak kii krurta kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In this atmosphere of disappointment for these wildlife, the Bishnoi caste of Maru state has kept a ray of hope alive
 ye log saikadon saalon se in vanyajeevon kii raksha ke liye apni jaan tak dene se nahin chook rahe
 However, the recent brutal incident of hunting of chinkara came to light in Shiv Tehsil of Barmer district in the last days of November
 seemaa par chal rahe sena ke yuddhayas ke dauraan nimla sajitda sainya kshetra main sena kii 88 armd workshop mess se rajasthan van vibhaag kii team ne 25 navambar ko chinkaara ke teen kate sir or kuch pairon sahit 15 kilo maance baraamad kiye
 The forest department filed a lawsuit against the five military personnel under the Wildlife Protection Act
 sena ne bhi is maamle main court of inkvyri kaa aadesh jari kar diya he
 Along with this, an alleged case of hunting of chinkaras was also reported in the army's Mahajan firing range in Bikaner area, although the army has denied any such wildlife hunting here
 unhone kaha he ki yahaan se baraamad maance murge kaa tha
 The case is currently under investigation
 sangrakshit kshetra main nishcint bhidate kaale hiransanrakshit kshetra main nishcint bhidate kaale hiranrajasthan main aisa pehali baar nahin hua he ki jab chinkaara kaa shikaar surkhiyon main aayaa he
 In the year 1998 too, actor Salman Khan hunted Chinkara during the shooting of one of his films in Jodhpur
 maamle main unhen nichali adaalat se paanch saal kii sajaa bhi ho chuki he
 Salman was accused of hunting black deer and chinkara during the shooting of "hum Saath Saath Hain" in September 1998
 nichali adaalat salmaan ko 26 sitambar kii raat kakani gaanv main kaale hiran or 28 sitambar kii raat bhavad gaanv ghoda farm main do chinkaara ke shikaar maamle main doshi maanati he
 In this case, charges have also been framed against Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre and Tabu
 darasal, chinkaara rajasthan kaa rajya pashu hi nahin he balki vanyajeev sangrakshan adhinium ke antargat baagh kii tarah hi shedul 1 kaa vanyajeev he or iskaa shikaar karne par saat varsh tak kii jail kaa praavdhaan he
 Nevertheless, their number is seen to fall sharply
 varsh 2009 main pradesh main 37,758 chinkaara the jo varsh 2010 main ghatakar 34,970 hi rah gaye
 Their number is also decreasing in western Rajasthan
 thar ke marusthal main varsh 2009 main 3,076 chinkaara the jo agle saal ghatakar 2,743 rah gaye
 It is clear that Chinkara is being hunted on a large scale
 rajasthan vanyajeev or paryaavaran cameti ke sadsy raajapaal singh kehete hai ki thar ke marusthal main rahane vaale sthaneey nivasee chinkaara ke shikaar kii shikaayat lagaataar karte aa rahe hai lekin prashasan masale ko gambhirtha se nahin le rahi he
 It is a matter of concern that the name of the army has also come up in this illegal act
 bishnoi samudaay ke ek vyakti ke paas nirbhay vicharan karte chinkarabishnoi samudaay ke ek vyakti ke paas nirbhay vicharan karte chinkaradusri taraf sthaneey log, khaskar pashchimi rajasthan ke bishnoi log chinkaara ke saath parivaar ke sadsy kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai or unase beintahaa pyaar karte hai
 In the villages of Bishnoi, deer and chinkaras are reared like children of the family
 yun bhi bishnoiyon kaa vanyajeevon or paryaavaran ke prati samarpan anupam he
 In the Chinkara poaching case too, the role of Bishnoi society has been instrumental in bringing Salman Khan behind bars
 paryaavaran sangrakshan ke liye mar mitane kii is jais panth ne aisi misaal kaayam kii he jo itihaas ke pannon par sunahare aksharon main darj he
 In 1730, in the village of Kheddali near Jodhpur, 363 women and men of the Bishnoi society were cut down with trees while protecting the khejri trees from the king's army
 is ghatana main ek mahila amrutha devi ke netritv main 83 gaanvon ke 363 bishnoi log pedo ko kaatane se bachaane ke liye usase lipat gaye the
 These included children, old, young, women
 bishnoiyon ke liye paryaavaran or vanyajeevon kii raksha karnaa unka jivan siddhant he
 It is one of the 29 life-principles set by Jambheshwar, the Guru of the Bishnois
 yah samaaj rajasthan main mukhya rup se pashchimi ilaake marwar main nivas karata he
 As most of Marwar is desert, there is a shortage of forests and wildlife in the same way
 In the last few years, encroachment on government land, especially on the land, has increased the concern for protecting wildlife
 sarkaar ne chinkaara ko rajya pashu to ghoshit kar diya he lekin uski suraksha ke prati vah koi khaas prayaas karti najar nahin aa rahi he
 Even when the villagers see it before their eyes and complain, the government staff does not show seriousness towards it
 paryaavaran prem kii door se bandhi bishnoi samudaay kii mahilaayein vriksh puujati huimparyaavaran prem kii door se bandhi bishnoi samudaay kii mahilaayein vriksh puujati huimbaharhaal, thar main rahane vaale gramin visheshkar bishnoi samaaj The villagers living in Thar, especially the Bishnoi sect, have not forgotten the rural resolve to protect trees and wildlife
 ye log aaj bhi inaki raksha ke liye apni jaan dene tak se nahin chookte
 Although this is to be said, but now there is nothing like this
 kareeb ek dashak pehle ek bishnoi panthi yuvak nihalchand vanyajeevon kii raksha kii koshish main shikariyon se ladate hue apni jaan par khel gaya
 Later, a film 'willing to Sacrifice' was also made on this incident
 film ko slowe ganraajya main hue film mahotsav main puraskrit bhi kiya gaya
 There is a saying in Rajasthan - 'sir Sathe remains dry, even if you are able to protect the trees', that is, if you are able to protect the trees by cutting your head, then consider it as a profitable deal
 jodhpur ke khejadli gaanv main sanwat 1787 kii bhadva sudi dashami, din mangalvaar ko khejadi ke pedo kii raksha ke liye vishnoi jati ke saikadon logon kii qurbaani kii gaatha iskaa jwalanth udhaaharan he
 In this 'chipko movement' women were in avant-garde
 kalantar main uttaranchal main sunderlaal bahuguna dwaara utprerit van raksha ke ‘chipko abhiyaan’ ko saadhaaran gruhaniyon ne hi paravaan chadhaaya tha
 Today, in the same manner as the campaign to desolate the forests is being carried out by the governments themselves, in such a situation social commitment like 'chipko campaign' is needed to save the forests
 khejadli ke balidaan kii gaatha romaanchak or preranaaspad he
 It was decided to cut trees of Khejri trees to supply the wood used for construction of Jodhpur Fort
 is par khejadli gaanv ke logon ne apni jaan kii keemat par bhi van kii raksha karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Eighty-four villages were informed of this decision
 saikadon kii taadaad main log khejadli gaanv main ikatthe ho gaye or pedo ko kaatane se rokane ke liye unase chipak gaye
 But the government did not care about it and when the trees started to be cut down by vandalism, the bodies of people clinging to them started falling into pieces
 ek vyakti ke katane par turant doosraa vyakti usee ped se chipak jaataa
 Amritadevi and her two daughters lived in Haraval in this sacrifice
 purushon main sarvapratham andoji ne balidaan diya tha or baad main virato banial, chavoji, oodoji, kanhoji, kisnoji, dayaram aadi purushon or dami, chami aadi striyon ne apane praan die
 In total, three hundred sixty-three women and men gave their lives
 jab is ghatana kii soochna jodhpur ke maharaja ko mili tab jaakar unhone pedo kii kataai rukvaai or bhavishya main vahaan ped na kaatane ke aadesh die
 In the memory of these heroes of Khejdali, a fair is held here every year on Bhadwa Sudi Dashami, in which thousands of people gather
 is ghatana kaa varnan karte hue kavi gokuji ne khejadli kii saakhi main likhaa he- ‘udo saar samaahi aayo, sir saunpa runkha sattai / sir saunpa ar nahin kampa, maran suun mat ko daro
 'there are many such incidents of voluntary giving of life for the protection of the forest, which are known from' Kheddli Ke Khandane '
 khejadli ke apratim balidaan se purv bhi, rajasthan kii marubhumi ke anek stri-purushon ne wanon kii raksha ke liye swechha se apane praanon kii aahuti di thi
 These men and women who were buried in the pages of history were followers of Jambhoji
 jambhoji ne samvath 1542 kii karthik vadi ashtami ko vishnoi dharm kaa pravartan kiya or apane anuyaayiyon ko ‘sabad vaani’ main upadesh diya ki wanon kii raksha karen
 The poet Udoji Nain, a devout poet of Jambhoji, insisted on protecting trees in twenty-nine rules for the followers of Vishnoi religion, wrote - 'kare rukh pratipal khejda rakhe rahaye
 ’ kavi vilhoji ne ‘batis aakhdi’ main ‘raakh dayaa ghat maahi, vriksh ghaavai nahin’ kah kar vrikshon kii kataai ko nishiddh bataaya
 The followers of Jambhoji planted trees in Oran around their villages and protected them
 vishnoi samaaj main van or vanya jeevon kii raksha ke liye vah utsarg yaa balidaan kaa jajba aaj bhi jinda he
 Such collective voluntary ritual of self-immolation to protect trees in Khedjali is unique and unique around the world
 is balidaan kii gauravamayi viraasat se prerit hokar har rajasthani ko van sangrakshan or sanvardhan ke liye sankalpabaddh hona chahie
 Scheduled tribes have also had a natural association with water, forest, land

 Two lakh twenty three thousand panchayats of India should be made conductors of forest protection culture
 har panchayat mukhyalay main ‘smriti van’ kii sthapana ho
 Plantation program should be conducted in the premises of every educational institution, government office

 Wherever industrial units, mineral quarrying and road extension units are established by cutting trees, they should be allowed to start production only after planting four times the trees earlier
 keval kagaji sarkari prayaason se marusthal haraa-bharaa nahin ho saktaa
 This objective can be met only with the cooperation of voluntary social institutions, development of a sense of responsibility among the common people and as far as possible the correct implementation of government schemes

 During the struggle, Malala started writing diaries at the age of 11
 varsh 2009 main chhadam naam "gul makai" ke tahat bibisi urdu ke liye diary likh malala pehali baar duniya kii nazar main ai thi
 In which he described Taliban's misdeeds in Swat and described his pain in a diary
 diary likhane kii shaukeen malala ne apni diary main likhaa tha, 'aaj skool kaa aakhri din tha isliye hamane maidan par kuch zyada der khilne kaa faisalaa kiya
 i believe that one day the school will open but on the way to leaving i saw the school building as if i will never come here again
 ' Malala has received numerous threats since the time she began writing about the excesses of the Taliban in blogs and media
 malala ne taliban ke kattar farmaanon se judi dardanaak dastaanon ko mahaj 11 saal kii umr main apni kalam ke jariye logon ke saamne laane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Malala is one of the aggrieved girls who were denied school for long due to Taliban decree
 teen saal pehle swat ghati main taliban ne ladakiyon ke skool jane par pabandi laga di thi
 Girls were also forbidden to watch TV programs
 swat ghati main talibaniyon kaa kabja tha or skool se lekar kai chizon par pabandi thi
 Malala also succumbed to it
 lekin apni diary ke madhyam se malala ne kshetra ke logon ko na sirf jaagruk kiya balki taliban ke khilaaf khadaa bhi kiya
 The Taliban took Swat into control in 2007

 In 2009, New York Times also made a film on Malala
 swat main taliban kaa aatank or mahilaon kii shiksha par pratibandh vishay par bani is film ke dauraan malala khud ko roak nahin pai or camere ke saamne hi rone lagi
 Malala was dreaming of becoming a doctor and the Taliban targeted her
 us dauraan do sau ladakiyon ke skool ko taliban se dhaha diya tha
 In 2009, the Taliban had clearly stated that not a single girl would go to school after January 15
 yadi koi is fatve ko maanane se inkaar karata he to apni maut ke liye vah khud jimmedaar hogi
 When the Taliban terror in Swat subsided, Malala's identity was revealed to the world and she was awarded an award for bravery
 isi ke saath vah international children pis award ke liye bhi namit hui

 champoo shravy kavy kaa ek bhed he, arthath gadhy-padya ke mishrit kavy ko champoo kehete hai
 The prose and poetry mixed poetry is called "champu"
 kavy kii is vidha kaa ullekh sahityashastra ke pracheen aacharyon- bhamah, dandi, vaaman aadi ne nahin kiya he
 Thus, the use of prose Padmayya style is also found in Vedic literature, Buddhist Jataka, Jatakamala etc
 in very ancient literature
 champookavy parampara kaa prarambh hamen atharv veda se praapt hota he
 Prakrit Kavya, named Champu, was not composed before the tenth century
 trivikram bhatta dwaara rachit 'nalchampu', jo dasvin sadi ke prarambh kii rachana he, champoo kaa prasiddh udhaaharan he
 Apart from this, the Yashashtilak composed by Somdev Suri, Bhojraj's Champu Ramayana, the poet Karnapuri's Anandavrindavan, Gopal Champu, Neelkanth Champu and Champu are examples of India from tenth to seventeenth century
 yah kavy rup adhik lokapriy na ho sakaa or na hi kavyashastra main uski vishesh manyata hui
 Yashodhara in Hindi is called champu-kavya, because both prose-verse has been used in it
 gadhy or padya ke is mishran kaa uchit vibhaajan yah prathit hota he ki bhavatmak vishyon kaa varnan padya ke dwaara tathaa varnanaatmak vishyon kaa vivaran gadhy ke dwaara prastut kiya jaay
 But Champurichayas have given importance to their free will and personal interest in the combination of both, by not paying special attention to this psychological feature
 gadhy-padya kaa sanmishran sanskrit sahitya main pracheen he, parantu kavyastylee main nibaddh, "champu" kii sangya kaa adhikari gadhy-padya kaa samanjas mishran utana pracheen nahin mana ja saktaa
 The compositions of prose-verse are available in Krishna Yajurvedic codes
 pali jaatakon main bhi gadhy main kathanak tathaa padya main mul sutratmak sanketon kii uplabdhi avashya hoti he
 But being devoid of poetry, we cannot consider them as "champu" in any way
 harishen rachit samudragupta kii prayagprashasti tathaa buddha kavi yanshur pranit jatakamala champu ke aadim rup maane ja sakate hai, kyonki pehle main samudragupta kii digvijay tathaa duusare main 34 jataka vishuddh kavyastylee kaa aashray lekar alankrita gadhy padya main varnit hai
 Champu seems to have been an enlarged form of prose poetry and that is why this poetic form emerged around the eternal ninth century of the golden age of prose poetry
 champu kavy kaa pratham nidarshan trivikram bhatta kaa nalchampu he jisamen champu kaa vaishishty sphutatya udbhasith hota he
 The trivikram composed this dainty champu while staying in the shelter of Indraj, the son of King Jagatuga and Lakshmi, the grandson of King Krishna of the south
 indraraj kaa rajbhishek visan 972 main hua tha or unke ashrith hone se kavi kaa bhi vahi samay he dasham shatee kaa purvardh
 The famous pranayakha of Nal and Damayanti is described in a very miraculous manner in the seven sorrows of this champu
 kavy main sarvatra shubhaga sanbhag shlesh kaa prasad lakshith hota he
 The "yashastilak Champu" of the Jain poet Somprabhasuri is a medieval work of the tenth century
 granthkaar rashtrakutanaresh krishna ke samant chalukya arikeshri ke putr kaa sabhakavi tha
 The character of King Yashodhar, eminent in Jain Puranas is described in detail in this Champu
 champu ke antim teen uchhravaason main jaindharm ke siddhaton kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kar kavi ne in siddhanton kaa paryaapt prachaar prastaar kiya he
 The description of the various religious, economic and social subjects of that era in the book is indicative of the comprehensive and multi-faceted worship of Somprabhasuri
 ram tathaa krishna ke charit kaa avlamban kar anek pratibhashali kaviyon ne apni pratibha kaa ruchir pradarshan kiya he
 Among such champu poems, Bhojraj's Ramayana Champu, Anantabhatta's "bharat Champu", Shesh Krishna's "parijataharan Champu" are quite famous
 bhojraj ne ramayana champu kii rachana kiskindha cond tak hi kii thi, jisaki purti lakshmana bhatta ne "yukand" kii tathaa venkatraj ne "uttar cond" kii rachana kar kii thi
 Like Jain poets, Chaitanya Mataavalambi Vaishnava poets adopted this fine poetry medium with great success to spread their principles
 bhagwaan shrikrishna kii lalaam lilaon kaa prasang aisa hi sundar avasar he jab in kaviyon ne apni aloksaamanya pratibha kaa prasad apane champu kaavyon ke dwaara bhakt pathakon ke saamne prastut kiya
 Anandavrindavan Champu of Poet Karnapur, and Gopalchampu of Jeeva Goswami are extremely successful poets in terms of Saras poetry
 inamen se pratham kavy krishna kii balalilaon kaa vistrut tathaa vishad varnan karata he, dwitiya kavy krishna ke samgr charit kaa maarmik vivaran he
 Eminent author Mitra Mishra of "veeramitrodaya", "anandakand Champu" adds an interesting series to Krishnaprakum champs
 dakshin bharat main bhi champukavyon kii lokapriyata kam na thi
 Neelkanth Dixit's "neelkanthvijay Champu" is about Samudramanthan
 shri vaishnav venkatadhvari ke "vishvagunadarsh champu" kii rachana anya champuon se is baat main vishisht he ki isamen bharat ke naanaa tirtho, dharmo tathaa shastragyon main dosha tathaa gunon kaa udghaatan badi maarmikata se ek saath kiya gaya he
 This is a particularly popular poem
 vanishwar vidyalankar kaa "chitrachampu" bengal ke ek vishisht pandit kavi kii rachana he jisamen bhakthi dwaara bhagwatprapti kaa sanket rupakastyle main ek saras aakhyaan ke madhya se kiya gaya he 
 Thus, despite being a popular medium for many centuries for the manifestation of sentiments in Sanskrit literature, Champu poetry could not be stagnant in North Indian language literature
 drawidi bhashaa ke sahitya main samanyat:, kerali tathaa andhra sahitya main visheshat:, champu kavy aaj bhi lokapriy he jiske pranyan kii ore kavijanon kaa dhyaan purnat: aakrisht he

 Lime is an inorganic material containing calcium, with carbonates, oxides, and hydroxides being the main ones
 kintu sahi taur par calcium oxide yaa calcium hydraksaide ko hi chuunaa maanate hai
 Lime is also a mineral
 gruhanirmaan main jodai ke liye prayukt honevli vastuon main chuunaa, sabase pracheen padaarth he, kintu ab iskaa sthaan portland cement ne liya he
 Lime is divided into the following two major parts: is chooney main calosium kii maatra adhik or amla main aviley padaarth chha: pratishat ke lagbhag rahata he
 Calcium is 71
43 percent and oxygen is 28
57 percent
 chuunaapatthar, khadiya yaa sip ko jalaakar yah chuunaa banaaya jaataa he
 It does not freeze with water
 is prakaar prastut chuunaa safed, amanibhiya hota he
 When extinguished in water does not erupt, it only swells and crushes and at the same time gives sufficient amount of heat
 aisa buja hua chuunaa jaliyit yaa buja chuunaa kehalaata he
 One method of extinguishing the lime is that by filling lime up to one foot high in a river, you fill it with water up to three feet
 24 ghante yaa adhik samay tak arthath jab tak yah puraa bujh na jaae, ise aise hi chhod dete hai
 After being extinguished, it should be sieved with a 12-hole sieve per square inch
 shuddh chooney ke gaare main hawa kaa carbon dioxide sanyukt hokar calosium carbonate banaata he, jisase yah jamata or kathor ho jaataa he
 It cannot be used to make a thick wall, because the interior lime does not get enough carbon dioxide to be converted into calcium carbonate
 is kaaran aisa gaara iton ko thik se jodta nahin
 It is suitable only for thin plastering on the inner walls and for the plowing of thin walls
 chooney main daanedaar baaluu mila dene se iske jodne ke gun main vruddhi ho jaati he
 This provides sufficient free space for the entry of air
 cement or chooney kaa gaara bhi kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Lime reduces shrinkage and cracks and adding one part lime to four parts cement increases viability without decreasing firmness
 gaare main 1 bhaag cement, 3 bhaag baaluu ke sthaan par 1 bhaag cement 1 bhaag chuunaa 6 bhaag baaluu rahanaa acha he
 Its consistency increases by adding lime to the lime and grinding it into the mill
 aisa chuunaa uttrakhand ke dehradun or madhya pradesh ke satna main adhikansh paaya jaataa he
 This lime is made by burning a large amount of pebble or clay containing limestone
 7 se lekar 30 dinon tak main pani ke andar jamanevaale chooney kaa jal-chuunaa kehete hai
 Depending on the time of freezing in water, it is called slow water, medium water and good water lime
 chooney main 5 se 30 pratishat mitti rah sakati he or isi kii maatra par jamana nirbhar karata he
 The increase in the amount of soil in the lime slows the quenching process and increases the water firmness properties
 jal chooney main silica, alumina or lauhaksaide apdravya ke rup main rahete hai jo chooney ke saath sanyukt hokar jal ke andar jamane or kathor honevaale yogic banaate hai
 Water lime should be extinguished just before use, not immediately after preparation
 pani ke andar tathaa un sthanon par jahaan dridhtaa aavashyak he, aise chooney kaa upyog hota he
 The pebbles required to make burnt lime are found a few feet below the surface in the plains of North India

 a Brahmin named Sukarma lived near the Devagiri mountain in the south country with his husband Parayana wife Sudesh
 ve donon shiv bhakt the kintu santaan na hone se chintit rahete the
 On the wife's request, he married his wife's sister Ghushma, who was a supreme Shiva devotee
 shiv krupa se use ek putr dhan kii prapti hui
 This led to the envy of Sudesh and he found the opportunity and killed the son of Saut
 bhagwaan shivaji kii krupa se balak ji uthaa tathaa ghusma kii prarthana par vahaan shivaji sadaiv vaas karne kaa vardaan diya or vahaan par vaas karne lage or ghushmeshwar ke naam se prasikad huen us talab kaa naam bhi tabase shivalay ho gaya
 This legend is described in the Puranas about this Jyotirlinga - Near the Devgiriparvat in the south country, there lived a very bright Taponishta Brahmin named Sudharma
 uski patni kaa naam sudeha tha donon main paraspar bahut prem tha
 He had no trouble of any kind
 lekin unhen koi santan nahin thi
 Astrology-calculation showed that childbirth cannot be born from the womb of Sudeha
 sudeha santan kii bahut hi icchhuk thi
 He urges Sudharma to remarry to his younger sister
 pehle to sudharma ko yah baat nahin janchi
 But in the end he had to bow to the wife's insistence
 ve uskaa aagrah taal nahin paae
 He married his wife's younger sister Ghushma and brought them home
 ghushma atyant vineet or sadaacharini stri thi
 She was the exclusive devotee of Lord Shiva
 pratidin ek sau ek parthiv shivlinga banaakar hriday kii sachhee nishtha ke saath unka pujan karti thi
 By the grace of Lord Shiva, a very beautiful and healthy child was born from his womb just a few days later
 bachche ke janm se sudeha or ghushma donon ke hi anand kaa paar na rahaa
 Both days were passing by very comfortably

 Three of them were almost complete, and with Utah in mind, they would make this fourth attempt in unprecedentedly large waves in France
 apane vishleshan ko pradarshan karne baad, utah ko khufia taur par france main paappas naamak field agent ke yahaan bheja jaataa he
 The two arrive at France and Utah, with the help of others, sets off on a long tunnel wave
 jyon hi vah pahunchataa, vahiin pehle se ek anya surfar laharon tak pahunch jaataa he, jise utah ke saath us asthir laharon par chhod detaa he
 Yutah gets trapped in those waves and faints, but the same surfer returns and saves Yutah

 They leave him to enjoy the party and then meet Samasara, an already familiar girl

 After Al Fariq's called party at the base, Samsara reveals that both he and Bodhi knew Ono Ozaki since childhood, when his parents died of an avalanche accident and Ozaki made them stay
 vah yah bhi bataati he he ozaki ne teesri chunauti ko puraa kar aage bhi jari rakhaa, jaisaa kii baaki vishwaas karte he ki wo nahin batch paaen
 Actually his death was not due to attempts to complete the challenge, but a large ship took his life for which he had climbed on the back of the whale to save the whale from their kill
 unki naav par maujuud, us kishor, bodhi, ne kabhi sachai bataane kaa nishchay kiya lekin ozaki ne jo aarambh kiya tha use anjaam dene kaa bhi pran thaan liya tha
 In the next journey he goes to a gold mine where Bodhi blasts the explosives that Grommet and Rach plant

 Yutah grabs Bodhi at the summit, but watches him fall into the falls, without knowing what he can do to complete the final challenge; Bodhi learns of the fourth unfinished challenge in which he saved Jani from drowning
 satraa maheenon baad, utah use prashanth mahaasaagar main duusari tuphaani laharon kaa saamana karte dundh letaa he
 Yutah tries to get Bodhi back as a punishment for the crimes he has committed so far, but he realizes Bodhi will not accept without surfing, both of whom know that there is no scope for him to return
