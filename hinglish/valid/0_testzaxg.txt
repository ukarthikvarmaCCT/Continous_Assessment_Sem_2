 is railgadee ko puna, jise 'deccan queen' yaa 'dakkhan kii rani' kahkar pukaara jaataa he ke naam par namit kiya gaya tha
 The locals still fondly call it 'deccan Ki Rani' or 'dakhan Chi Rani' in the local language Marathi
 yah railgadee kai logon ke liye in do shaharon ke bich pratidin pravaas karne kaa ek pramukh saadhan he
 The day of 1 June 1930 holds a special place in the history of Indian Railways, when the then Great Indian Peninsula Railway flagged Deccan Queen, India's first deluxe train, from India's commercial capital Bombay to Poona, the cultural capital of Maharashtra
 
 is railgadee kaa sanchaalan in donon shaharon ke bich hona nirdhaarit hua tha
 Several 'firsts' or 'firsts' are recorded in the Deccan Queen's account: - deccan queen kii shuruyaat do railgadiyon ke set se huyi thi: ek kaa rang rupahalaa tha jabaki uski sajaavati dhariyon ko gahare laal rang se ranga gaya tha duusari kaa rang rajasi nila or sajaavat sunahari thi
 The lower structures of these vehicles were built by the Metropolitan Camel C&W Works, England, while the addition of vehicle bodies and coaches was done at Matunga Carriage and Wagon Works, Bombay
 gaadi kii abhijatya chhavi or isamen safar karne vaale sambhavit yatriyon ke str ko dekhte huye isamen uplabdh suvidhaayon ke str ko ek spasht aupniveshik rang diya gaya tha
 Each train had 61 passengers in the first class and 156 passengers in the second class
 gaadi main 19 parichaarak bhi niyukt kiye gayi the
 At that time, third class passengers were not allowed to travel on the Deccan Queen
 deccan queen ne is maarg par pehle se chal rahi, pratishthit puna mail ko lokapriyata or prasiddhi main bahut peeche chhod diya
 Apart from providing luxury travel, it reduced the travel time from 6 hours to just 2 hours 45 minutes
 samay main hui is katautee kaa kaaran vidyutchalit ingine tha
 While other trains were pulled by steam locomotives, the Deccan Queen had an electric locomotive from its inception
 deccan queen ko mul rup se sirf aupniveshik adhipatiyon ke liye hi shuru kiya gaya tha
 Due to this it was initially run as a weekend special train for 'gora Sahib'
 ek dashak se adhik samay tak yah isi prakaar sanchalit hoti rahi, lekin yatriyon kii ghatati sankhya ke kaaran yah dhire dhire ghate kaa sauda sabit hone lagi
 In order to make its operations profitable, Indians were also allowed to travel through it in 1943
 is kadam se yatriyon kii sankhya itani bad gayi kii ise saptahanth vishesh se badal kar ek dainik railgadee bana diya gaya
 The Deccan Queen was also often called the 'husband special' train, as men working in Mumbai used to go to Poona to meet their families in the weekend
 baharhaal, kaamkaaji mahilaon kii badhati hui sankhya bhi deccan queen ke yatri profil kaa hissaa ban gayi thi
 The Deccan Queen departs from Pune railway station at 07:15 am and arrives at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus at 10:30 am three hours later
 chhatrapati shivaji terminus se phir yah railgadee shaam 17:10 baje prasthaan karti he or raat 20:25 ko pune railway stesan par iskaa aagaman hota he

 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained

 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary

 The earliest mention of the effort to make steam engines is found in the writings of the Hero of Alexandria
 hero us vikhyath alaxandreey sampradaay schwör bei koranka sadsy tha jisamen tolemi, euclid, iretosthanij jaise tatkaaleen vigyaan ke maharathi sammilit the
 In his article, Hero describes a device in which air was heated in a closed box and circulated down a pipe passage to a water-filled vessel
 isamen bartan kaa pani duusari nalee main chadhataa tha or ek nakli phuhaaraa ban jaataa tha
 Then after this, no details are found in this regard
 1606 i
 main, hero se lagbhag 2,000 varsh baad, nepolian academy ke sansthaapak or tatkaaleen europe main vigyaan ke agrani netaa marxev dela porta ne hero ke phuharevaale prayog main hawa kii jagah bhaap kaa upyog kiya
 He also suggested that in order to fill a vessel with water, it should be connected to a pond with water by a tube and then after filling steam in that vessel and then cooling it with water from above, the inner steam condensed Vacuum will generate and instead the water from the pond will be filled in the vessel
 1698 i
 main marxev dela porta ke is suzav kaa upyog tamas severy ne pani chadhaane kii ek mashin main kiya
 Thus Savory was the first person to create a steam engine for commercial use, which was used to pump water from the mines and to drain water from the wells
 severy ke ingine ke avishkaar ke baad bhaap ingine kaa aglaa charan newcomen ingine kaa avishkaar tha
 It was invented by Thomas Newcomen
 is ingine kaa khadaanon or kuon se pani nikaalane main 50 varshon tak upyog hota rahaa
 It also has historical significance, because this opened the way for James Watt's inventions
 is ingine main pehali baar silinder or piston kaa upyog kiya gaya jo ab tak bhaap injanon main prayukt kiye jate hai
 Steam in the newcomen engine is only used to generate vacuum
 piston uthaane kaa kaam, jisase pani chadhataa he, vayumandaleey daab karata he
 But it only takes a lot of fuel waste to condense the steam
 james wat kaa mahatvapurn kaary bhaap ingine ko sarvshereshth rup dena he jisase manushya kii shakti das guni bad gai or vyavsaayik kshetra main brihad parivartan ho gaya
 James Watt was a clever scientific engineer in Glasgow and in 1763 he was ordered by a physics professor at the University of Glasgow to repair a Newcomen engine that never ran well
 marammat karke samay wat ko dhyaan aayaa ki isamen eendhan buree tarah se vyarth ho jaataa he
 Watt of thoughtful nature started the idea of making the best machine from it
 is prakaar unhone anek anveshan kiye or yantra banaae, jinase bhaap ingine ko uskaa vartmaan swaroop praapt hua or vah udyog or sabhyataa kii pragati main shaktishaalee saadhan bana
 The following are the main types of steam engines: ekakriya ingine main bhaap piston ke ek hi ore kaary karti he evam dvikriya ingine main bhaap piston ke donon ore kaary karti he
 If both these types of engines have the same condition in all other states, the power received by the two-way engine is twice the power received by the other type of engine
 yahi kaaran he ki in dinon ekakriya ingine kam hi vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 The engine is called vertical or horizontal according to whether the cylinder's axis is vertical or horizontal
 kshaitij ingine urdhwadhar ingine se adhik jagah gherta he
 The vertical type engine has less friction etc
, due to which it can run for more days than horizontal engine
 bhaap ingine kii chaal vastut: iske crank shift parikraman prati minute kii chaal hoti he
 The average piston speed in an engine with four foot piston stroke and 80 revolutions per minute would be 640 feet per minute
 yah ingine nimna chaal ingine kaha jayega
 Generally, an engine running at a speed of less than 100 revolutions per minute is called a low speed engine and an engine running at a speed of more than 250 revolutions per minute is called a high speed engine
 100 or 250 parikraman prati minute ke bich kii chaal par chalanevaale ingine ko "madhyam chaal ingine" kehete hai
 The greatest quality of a high speed engine is that it is of very small size for equal power
 ucch chaal ke kaaran bhaap bhi kam hi kharch hoti he, kyonki is prakaar ke ingine main bhaap or silinder ke bich ooshmaa sthanantaran main bahut hi kam samay lagata he
 The compaction engine is a steam engine from which steam is discharged directly into the atmosphere and for this the pressure of steam in the cylinder should never be less than the pressure of the atmosphere
 sanghanan ingine main bhaap kaary karne ke baad sanghnitr main pravesh karti he evam vah vahaan vayumandal kii daab par jal main parivartit ho jaati he
 The behavior of the condenser allows steam to function more
 saral ingine main prayek silinder boyler se sidhe bhaap paata he evam sidhe vayumandal yaa sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 In a combustion engine, steam is transmitted to a lesser extent in a cylinder called a high pressure cylinder, and then to a larger cylinder, called a low pressure cylinder, and the propagation is complete here
 bahudhaa nimna daab silinder sanghnitr main nikaas karata he
 Propagation can also take place in three or four cylinders and these engines are called triprasar engines or tetraspara engines
 ooshmaa ingine kii adhiktam dakshata / T1 hoti he jisamen T1 or T2 ooshmaa ingine chakra main adhiktam evam nunatam taap hai
 This suggests that the efficiency of the engine depends on both these temperatures
 bhaanp ingine kii dakshata utani hi badhati jaaegi jitani kaa mulya badhegaa evam kaa mulya ghatega
 To increase the value of steam, the pressure of steam coming into the engine from the boiler has to be increased, because the higher the pressure of steam, the higher the value
 ko badhaane kaa ek or upaay he
 That is superheating the steam
 atitapak kaa boyler main vyavhaar karke bhaap kaa adhitaap badhaayaa jaataa he
 To reduce the value of K, it becomes necessary to behave the condenser
 sanghnitr main thande jal dwaara bhaap jal main parivartit kii jaati he
 Therefore, the value of a good condenser can be equal to the temperature of cold water
 isse pataa chalata he ki bhaap ingine main adhik daab evam atitpt bhaap dwaara kaary karaane se evam kaary karaane ke baad bhaap ko sanghnitr main prapya thande jal ke taap ke baraabar taap par jal main parivartit karne se ingine adhik daksh hoga
 Steam from the boiler enters the steambox at high pressure
 piston jaise hi stroke ke ant main pahunchataa he, usee samay valve chalata he, jisamen bhapadwar khul jaataa he evam bhaap silinder main pravesh karti he
 The piston moves when pushed by steam pressure
 ise agr stroke kehete hai
 The crank, crank shaft and centrifuge move by piston movement
 utkendrak ke chalane se dwaar kuch or adhik khul jaataa he
 Steam continues to enter the cylinder until the door is closed
 is samay viched hota he evam iske baad silinder main bhaap kaa sambharan nahi ho paata
 The steam in the cylinder is now transmitted and in this expansion the volume of steam increases and the pressure decreases
 isi prakaar ke samay bhaap kaary karti he
 At the end of the front stroke, the valve opens the steam side towards the exhaust, releasing the steam
 nikali hui bhaap kii daab pasch daab ke baraabar ho jaati he
 After a few moments of release, the piston returns backward and is called the alternating stroke
 is stroke main lautate samay piston silinder main bachi hui bhaap kaa nikaas karata jaataa he
 When the piston reaches the end of this stroke, the valve closes the exhaust gate, stopping the flow of steam
 silinder sheersh or piston ke bich kuch bhaap batch jaati he, jo nirmukt nahin ho paati he
 Then the cycle is repeated
 dvikriya ingine main isi se sadrush chakra kii kriya silinder kii duusari ore hoti he
 The Rankin cycle is a theoretical cycle according to which the steam engine operates
 gati niamak kaa mukhya kaary ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karnaa he
 The speed-regulator of a steam engine keeps the speed of cruises constant with the help of these two methods: shakti kii maang ke anusaar bhaap kii daab ko badhaakar yaa ghataakar ingine kii gati kaa niyaman karanevaale gatiniamak ko avrodh gatiniamak kehete hai
 The actuator drives a barrier valve, which is placed in the main steam tube
 is prakaar ke gatiniamakon main mukhya gatipalak kanduk gatiniamak hota he
 The valve is of a balanced type, that is, the resultant force by the steam is zero
 jab ingine kii gati badhati he, gatiniamak kandukon ke paribhraman kii gati main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he, jisase kentrapasari bal bad jaataa he
 This increase of force forces them to move out against the forces of gravity and control
 iske chalate valve kuch ansh main band ho jaataa he
 The pressure of the steam acting on the piston decreases when the valve is blocked, which also reduces the power generated
 evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam ingine kii gati main kami hone ke kaaran valve kamaani upar uth jaati he evam piston par kaary karanevaali bhaap kii daab main vruddhi ho jaati he, jiske falswaroop gati badhkar saamaanya gati par aa jaati he
 a simple line will be obtained if the weight of the steam transferred per hour in the engine is measured with horsepower after the use of a regular steam engine by the barrier speed-regulator
 yah sambandh sarvapratham vilian ne paaya tha
 Hence, it is called "the line of Villian" in his name
 gatipalkachakr ko isha ke saath chaabi ke dwaara atakaya jaataa he
 Large propellants are fitted in low-speed carrier ships and these propellants make 80 revolutions per minute
 is tarah ke jahaajon main bhaap ingine bahut hi upyukt hai
 In high-speed vessels, steam turbines are being used instead of steam engines

 Richard Trevithick first used steam locomotives to manufacture rail engines
 kintu aarthik kathinaayee ke kaaran unka prayaas safal na ho paaya
 Eventually George and Robert Stevenson were credited with making a successful rail engine, Fig
 7, and driving the train between Lowerpul and Manchester in 1829 AD
 jalayanon ke liye bhaap ingine kaa pratham upyog 1812 i
 main rabart pulton ne kiya tha
 Ordinary rail engines have the behavior of a horizontal steam engine
 yah ingine rail ingine boyler ke paas thos aadhaar par laga rahata he
 Almost all the locomotives do not have condenser
 kaary karne ke baad bhaap ko sidhe vayumandal main chhod diya jaataa he
 There are two types of such engines: aadhunik dizine main in donon prakaaron ko jod diya jaataa he, arthath kuch silinder ingine ke frem ke andar rahete hai evam kuch silinder baahar rahete hai
 Several changes have been made to James Watt's steam engine, although the main principle is still the same
 parivartanon kii aavashyaktaa bhaap ingine ke anekanek kaayon main prayukt hone ke kaaran hui

 feritima kii varm casting mitti kii pruthak goliyon ke chote dher jaisi hoti he or utyphius kii casting mitti kii uthi hui rekhaon ke samaan hoti he
 Earthworms are true friends and helpers of farmers
 inkaa mitti khaane kaa dhang laabhadaayak he
 They plow the earth in a way and make it fertile for the farmers
 varm casting kii upree mitti suukh jaati he, phir baarik hokar prithvi kii sataha par fail jaati he
 In this way, the soil where earthworms live becomes poli, so that water and air can enter the earth easily
 is prakaar kentue hal ke samaan kaary karte hai
 Darwin has reported that over 10,000 earthworms live on one acre
 ye kentue ek varsh main 14 se 18 ton, yaa 400 se 500 man mitti prithvi ke neeche se laakar sataha par ekatrit kar dete hai
 This makes the Earth's surface 1 / 5 inch high
 yah mitti kentuon ke pachan ang se hokar aati he, isaliye isamen nitrogenyukt padaarth bhi mil jate hai or yah khaad kaa kaary karti hai
 In this way, they keep the earth fertile for humans

 Einstein wrote more than fifty papers and books apart from science
 1999 main time patrika ne shatabdi-purush ghoshit kiya
 According to a survey, he was considered the greatest scientist of all time
 oinstin ne 300 se adhik vaigyanik shodh-patron kaa prakaashan kiya
 On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the display of over 30,000 unique documents and papers from Einstein
 oinstin ke bauddhik uplabdhiyon or apurvata ne "oinstin" shabd ko "budhimaan" kaa paryaay bana diya he
 Albert Einstein was born in Germany into a Jewish family in Wüttemberg
 unke pita ek ejeeniyar or celsman the
 His mother was Pauline Einstein
 haalaanki oinstin ko shuru-shuru main bolne main kathinaayee hoti thi, lekin ve padhai main awwal the
 His mother tongue was German and later he also learned Italian and English
 1880 main unka parivaar munich shahar chalaa gaya, jahaan unke pita or chachaa ne milakar "electratechnic frabik je oinstin and si" naam kii company kholi, joki bijli ke upkaran banaati thi
 And it also provided lights for the first time at the Oktoberfest fair in Munich
 unka parivaar yahudee dharmik paramparaon ko nahin maanata tha, or isi vajah se oinstin catholic vidhyalay main padhne ja sake
 He learned to play Sarangi at the behest of his mother
 unhen ye pasand nahin tha or baad me ise chhod bhi diya, lekin baad me unhe mozart ke sarangi sangeet me bahut anand aata tha
 In 1894, his father's company could not get a contract to supply for electric lighting in the city of Munich
 jiske kaaran huye nuksaan se unhen apni company bechni pad gai
 In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, where they first settled in Milan and then a few months later in the city of Pavia
 parivaar ke pavia jane ke baad bhi oinstin munich main hi apni padhai puri karne ke liye ruke rahen
 In late December 1894, he traveled to Italy to visit his family in Pavia
 italy main apane samay ke dauraan unhone "ek chumbakeey kshetra main ether kii avasthaa kii jaanch" sheershak ke saath ek laghu niabandh likhaa tha
 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "
 ve khud ke kaam ke alaava duusare vaigyanikon ke saath bhi sahyog karte the, jiname bose oinstin ke aankade, oinstin refricrator or anya kai aadi shaamil hai
 
 anus mirabilis papers chaar lekhon se sambandhit hai jise oinstin ne 1905 ko onlan der physic naam kii ek vaigyanik patrika main prakashit kiya tha, jiname prakashavidyut prabhaav, brounian gati, vishesh saapekshatawaad, or e = mc2 shaamil the
 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means
 yahi patr, 1905 ke brounian gati par shodh-patr ke liye neenv bane, jisamen pataa chalaa ki anuo kii upasthiti hetu brounian gati ko thos saboot kii tarah upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena
 unhone saapekshata ke siddhant ko vyakt kiya
 Which, according to Herman Minkowski, is known for the generalization of alternation alternately from space to space-time
 anya siddhant jo oinstin dwaara banaaye gaye or baad main sahi sabit hue, main samanta ke siddhant or kwantum sankhya ke samoshna samanyikaran ke siddhant shaamil the
 Einstein's paper "on the dynamics of electricity of moving bodies" was completed on 30 June 1905 and published on 26 September of the same year
 yah bijli or chumbakatv ke maxwell ke sameekaran or yantriki ke siddhanth, prakaash kii gati ke kareeb yantriki main bade badlaav ke baad, ke bich saamanjasy nishchit karata hai
 This was later known as Einstein's special theory of relativity
 jiskaa nishkarsh tha ki, samay- antariksh dhaanche main gatisheel padaarth, dhimaa or sankuchit najar aata hai, jab ise paryvekshak ke dhaanche main mapa jaataa he
 This paper also argued that the idea of luminiferous ether was excessive
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata ke apane shodh-patr main, oinstin ne vishesh saapekshata samikarnon se E=mc2 ko nirmit kiya
 Since 1905 Einstein's research in relativity remained controversial for many years, although it was also accepted by many leading physicists such as Max Planck
 1905 ke ek patr main, oinstin bataaya kii ki prakaash swatah hi sthaneey kanon ke bane hote hai
 Einstein's light quanta hypothesis was rejected by almost all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Burr
 robert millican kii prakashavidyut prabhaav par vistrut prayog, tathaa compton bikharane kii maap ke saath, yah pariklpana saarvbhaumik rup se 1919 main sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem
 peter dibai ne is model ko parishkrut kiya
 During the 1910s, it expanded to bring individual systems within the realm of quantum mechanics

 In 1911, Einstein found that the same temperate theory shows that the quantity that is quantized in any mechanical motion must be a stabilizing invariant
 arnald samarfield ne samoshna aparivartaneey ko paaramparik yantriki main gatisheel char ke rup main pahchaan kii
 According to this theory- albert oinstin kaa is vishay main bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 While traveling, Einstein wrote letters to his wife Elsa and adopted daughter Kadamuni Margot and Ilse
 ye patr, da hebrew uniwarsity main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Margot Einstein had allowed these private letters to be made available to the public, but at the same time requested that they not be done until twenty years after his death

 Barbara Wolff of the Albert Einstein Archives of the Hebrew University told the BBC that there were approximately 3500 letters of personal correspondence written between 1912 and 1955
 14 july san 1930 ko berlin main ainstin kii mulaakaat bharat ke mahaan sahityakar, rahasyavid va nobel puraskaar vijeta gurudev rabindranath thakur se hui
 This meeting and interaction between a great scientist of his time, a great scientist of his time and a great thinker and devout poet representing the religious ideology of the East, is considered a unique legacy of history
 oinstin ek bhavuk, patibaddh jatvaad virdohi the, or princeton main neshnal association of da advancement of colord pipal sanstha ke sadsy bhi the, jahaan unhone africa americanyon ke naagarik adhikaron ke liye abhiyaan main hissaa bhi liya
 He considered racism to be America's "worst disease", at the time of his involvement, he was a civil rights activist W
B
 Du Bois, and agreed to testify on his behalf during one of his trial in 1951
 jab oinstin ne du bois ke charitra ke liye gavaah hone kii peshkash kii, to nyaayadhish ne mukademe ko kaarij karne kaa faisla kiya
 In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historic black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree
 oinstin ne america main naslwad ke bare main bhaashan diya, unka kahana tha, "meraa iske bare main chup rahane kaa koi iraadaa nahin hai
 "A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had ever paid college education fees for black students
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh se purv, ek akhbaar ne apane ek kollam main ek sankshipt vivaran prakashit kiya kii oinstin ko america main itani acchhee tarah se janaa jaataa tha ki log unhen sadak par roak kar unke die siddhant kii vyakhya poochne lagate the
 Eventually he figured out a way to avoid this constant questioning
 ve unase kehete kii "maaf kijiye! mujhe log aksar professor oinstin samajhate hai par wo main nahin hoon
 "einstein has been the subject or inspiration of many novels, films, plays and musicals
 vah "pagal" vaigyanikon" yaa anymansk prophessoron ke chithran ke liye ek pasandida charitra the; unki arthpurna cheharaa or vishisht keshavinyas style kaa vyapak rup se nakal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Frederick Golden of Time magazine once wrote that Einstein was "like a cartoonist's dream coming true"
 oinstin ne kai puraskaar or sammaan praapt kiye or 1922 main unhen bhautikee main "saidhantik bhautikee ke liye apni sevaaon, or visheshkar prakashvaidhut prabhaav kii khoj ke liye" nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 If no nomination in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, then the award of 1921 went ahead and Einstein was awarded it in 1922
