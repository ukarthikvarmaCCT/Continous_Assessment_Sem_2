 homeopathy, ek chikitsa paddati he
 Dr
 Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann is the father of homeopathy medical science
 yah chikitsa ke 'samarupata ke sinddhaat' par aadhaarit he jiske anusaar aushadhiyaan un rogon se milte julate rog dur kar sakati hai, jinhen ve utpann kar sakati hai
 The curative power of the drug depends on the symptoms that may arise
 jinhen rog ke lakshanon ke samaan kintu unase prabal hona chahie
 Therefore, the disease can be determined and destroyed with the help of the same medicine, which can produce all the symptoms in the human body, strong with the symptoms and very similar to the symptoms
 homeopathy paddati main chikitsak kaa mukhya kaary rogi dwaara bataae gaye jivan-itihaas evam rogalakshanon ko sunakar usee prakaar ke lakshanon ko utpann karanevaali aushadhi kaa chunaav karnaa he
 The greater the similarity between disease symptoms and drug symptoms, the greater the chances of a patient becoming healthy
 chikitsak kaa anubhav uskaa sabase bada sahaayak hota he
 Treatment of chronic and difficult diseases requires patience for both the patient and the physician
 kuch homeopathy chikitsa paddati ke samarthakon kaa mat he ki rog kaa kaaran sharir main shoravish kii vruddhi he
 Homeopathy practitioners believe that every living being we have a tendency to maintain the functional ideal of the senses and when this functional ideal is distorted, then the creature has many reactions to achieve this ideal
 praani ko aushadhi dwaara keval uske prayaas main sahaayta milti he
 The medicine should be given in small amounts, because in the disease, the patient is hyper-sensitive
 aushadhi kii alp maatra prabhavakaari hoti he jisase keval ek hi prabhaav prakat hota he or koi dushaprinaam nahin hote
 This monotonic effect is regulated in the restoration of health due to the modulated aggregation of tissues in the morbidity
 vidwaan homeopathy ko chhadam vigyaan maanate hai
 The basic principle of homeopathy promoted by Dr
 Hahnemann is - "similia simivibus curator" means diseases that are safely, quickly and very effectively cured by drugs that are capable of producing symptoms similar to the patient's symptoms
 duusare shabdon main, is niyam ke anusaar jis aushadhi kii adhik maatra swasth sharir main jo vikaar paidaa karti he usee aushadhi kii laghu maatra vaise samalakshan vaale prakritik lakshanein ko nasht bhi karti he
 For example, the symptoms of colds that arise on cutting raw onions, such as watering from the nose, eyes, and in the same type of cold, giving homeopathic medicine Ailium cepa can also be cured
 homeopathy main rogiyon ko ek samay main ek hi aushadhi ko dene kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 On the basis of experience, Hahnemann decided to legislate only one drug at a time, but now this opinion has changed enough
 aadhunik chikitsakon main se kuch to hanemaan ke bataae maarg par chal rahe hai or kuch logon ne apana swatantra maarg nishchit kiya he or ek baar main do, teen aushadhiyon kaa prayog karte hai
 On the basis of similar science, the amount of medicine selected by the patient should be very low so that the side effects of the medicine are not seen
 prathmat: yah sharir kii pratirohak kshamta ko safal karne main ghatak kaa kaam karata he
 Homoeopathic medicine is specially prepared which is called the name of drug empowerment
 thius padaarthon ko trcuration or taral padaarthon ko sacshan pranali se taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 This is a basic theme
 yah sach bhi he ki homeopathy rogon ke naam par chikitsa nahin karti
 In fact, it treats all aspects of mental, emotional and physical aspects of a person suffering from the disease
 asthma ke paanch rogiyon kii homeopathy main ek hi dawa se chikitsa nahin kii ja sakati
 Depending on the overall symptom, it may be prescribed different medicines in five patients
 haniman ne manushya ke sharir main jeevani shakti ko pahchaan kar yah pratipaadit kiya ki yah jeevani shakti sharir ko bahya rup se akraman karne vaale rogon se bachaati he
 But in the condition of disease, this biographical power becomes disease
 sadrush vigyaan ke aadhaar par chayan kii gai aushadhi is jeevani shakti ke vikaar ko nasht kar sharir ko rog mukt karti he
 Hahnemann found that the underlying causes of all chronic diseases are psoriasis, psychosis, and syphilis
 inako haniman ne miasm shabd diya jiskaa unani arth he - pradooshit karnaa
 It is necessary to have knowledge of their therapeutic ability to use medicine for medicine
 aushadhi pramann homeopathy main aisi prakiya he jisame aushadhiyon kii swasth manushyon main prayog karke dawa ke mul lakshanein kaa gyaan kiya jaataa he
 Certification of these drugs is done on healthy humans and diseases are treated with the help of similar science based on the knowledge of the symptoms caused by them
 is chikitsa paddati kaa mahatvapurn paksh aushadhi samarthy he
 Initially, Hanaman used to use medicines of high potency, but from experience he found the use of medicines of low potency effective
 unhone paaya ki anekon baar jahaan beemaari ke shaareerik parivartan yaa bahya kaarak maujuud hai vahaan nimnasamarthy kii aushadhi behatar kaary karti he
 Three types of scales are used in homeopathic medicine - isamen main dawa ke ek bhaag ko vehicle ke nau bhaag main milakar triturate yaa succussion kii prakriya kii jaati he
 The scale of the medicine made from them is known by the word "x" like black phos 6x, aconite 3x etc
 adhikanshtayah thos aushadhiyon main prayukt kii jane vaali is is scale main 1x banane ke liye dawa kaa ek bhaag or dugdh-sharkara kaa 9 bhaag lete hai, taral aushadhiyon main 1x banane hetu ek bhaag mulark or 9 bhaag alcohol kaa prayog hota he
 Beyond this, take one part of 1x and 9 parts of milk sugar or alcohol for 2x; In order to make many potencies like this, by taking a part of the previous potency, you increase the power ahead
 isamen dawa ke ek bhaag ko vehicle ke 99 bhaag se sakkashan kiya jaataa he
 The drugs made from them are known by the power of medicine "c"
 jaise 30c, 200c, 1000c aadi
 Succession is not just about mixing the original extract of the medicine with alcohol, but it has to be done
 aajkal sakkashan ke liye swachaalit mashin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jab ki puraane samay main yah swayan hi haath se banani hoti thi
 To make the first potency, one part of the original drug extract and 99 parts alcohol is taken, suctioning it 10 times to prepare the first potency; Similarly for the second potency, one part of the previous potency and 99 parts alcohol; Similarly, further potency is prepared
 homeopathy ke virodh ke kaarnon main ek pramukh kaaran homeopathic aushadhiyon kii nune maatra bhi he
 Homeopathy drugs are in the form of extracts, extracts and diluents and some are washed in ether or glycerin, such as serpents
 arq mukhyatya pashu tathaa vanaspati jagat se vyutpann hai
 These are called distinctive rasas, root extracts or matics tinctures and symbolized by the Greek letter 'theta'
 matrix tinchar tathaa sampeshan se vibhinn samarthyon ko taiyaar karne kii vidhiyaan samaan hai
 Medicines of different strengths are prepared in diluents
 mulark se prarambh karne ke baad tanuta ke mapkram main ham jyon-jyon upar badhate hai, tyon-tyon aprishkrut padaarth se dur hatate jate hai yahi kaaran he ki homeopathy vidhi se nirmit aushadhiyaan saamanytah vishaheen evam ahaanikaarak hoti hai
 These drugs have amazingly impressive medicinal properties
 ye roganashan main prabal or sharir gathan ke prati niskriy hota hai
 Drugs are made from the elements and many other substances such as sulfur, mercury, arsenic, zinc, tin, baryta, gold, silver, iron, lime, copper, and tellurium
 tatwon ke yogicon se bhi aushadhiyaan bani hai
 260 to 270 medicines are described in the Homeopathy Pharmacology
 inamen se adhikansh kaa swasth nar, nari yaa bacchon par pareekshan kar rogotpadak gun nishchit kiye gaye hai
 The remaining drugs are ranked as empirical in the returns

 gharelu hinsa sahavaas athwa vivaah jaise bandhanon ke baad gharelu str par ek saathi kaa anya saathi ke saath marpet athwa durvyavhaar ko prakat karne vaala shabd he
 Abuse of intimate partner or life partner also comes under the category of domestic violence
 gharelu hinsa vipareet lingi athwa samalangik sambandhon main bhi ho sakati he
 Domestic violence can have various forms, including physical, emotional, verbal, economic, and sexual abuse, including bullying from post-marriage to forced sexual relations and violent physical abuse and as a result mental or physical distortion or death is possible
 vaishvik rup se saamanytah patni athwa mahila saathi gharelu hinsa kii shikaar adhik hoti he haalanki iskaa shikaar purush saathi athwa donon ek duusare ke khilaaf gharelu hinsa kaa shikaar ho sakate hai athwa doshi aatmaraksha yaa pratishodh ke kaaran bhi gharelu hinsa kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 While women of domestic violence in the developed world are encouraged to complain openly to authorities, it is argued that domestic violence with men is not reported as it would make them socially cowardly and Is considered masculine

 Kumbhandas was a famous poet of Ashtachap
 ye paramananddaas ji ke samakaleen the
 Kumbhandas's Charit is compiled according to the "talks of the Chaurasi Vaishnavana"
 kumbhandas braj main govardhan parvat se kuch dur "jamunaavatau" naamak gaanv main rahaa karte the
 There was farming in his house
 apane gaanv se ve parsoli chandrasarovar hokar shrinath ji ke mandir main kirthan karne jate the
 He was born in Gaurava Kshatriya clan
 kumbhandas ke saat putr the, jinamein chaturbhajadas ko chhodkar anya sabhi krishi karm main lage rahete the
 He took initiation from Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya in 1492 AD
 ve puri tarah se virakt or dhan, maan, maryaada kii ichha se koson dur the
 Once Akbar was called by the emperor, he had to go to Fatehpur Sikri where he was respected
 par iskaa inhen baraabar khed hi rahaa, jaisaa ki inke is pad se vyanjit hota he- It is estimated that Kumbhandas was born to Chaitra Krishna Ekadashi in Samvat 1525 Vikrami in a village named Jamunavatto, Govardhan, Mathura
 ve gorwa kshatriya the
 His father was a simple man
 kheti karke jeevika chalaate the
 Kumbhandas also believed in paternal instinct and he liked the life of the farmer
 parsoli main vishesh rup se kheti kaa kaary chalata tha
 Lack of money kept knocking him for a lifetime, but he did not spread his hand in front of anyone
 bhagavadbhakti hi unki sampatti thi
 His family was very large, he followed it with income from farming
 parivaar main inaki patni ke atirikt saat putr, saat putr-vadhuen or ek vidhwaa bhatiji thi
 Kumbhandas was the ultimate Bhagavadbhakta, an ideal householder and a great defender
 ve ni:sprut, tyaagi or mahasantoshi vyakti the
 The unique, supernatural character of the new character was that God would appear to be angry with him in the form of Sakha Bhava 
 mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ji unke diksha-guru the
 In the 1550 Vikrami, during the time of Acharya's goverment visit, he took Brahmasabandha
 unke diksha-kaal ke pandrah saal purv shrinath ji kii murti prakat hui thi, acharya kii ajna se ve shrinath ji kii seva karne lage the
 Even after being appointed as Kirtankar in the temple of Dixit and Shrinathji in 'pushtimarg', he did not give up his instinct and continued to maintain his family till the end

 jab beringia astitv main tha to kshetreey mausam anukool hone kii vajah se yahan barfabaari kam hoti thi or vaataavaran madhya asia ke stapi maidaanon jaisaa tha

 His special impact continued until the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991
 He had considerable ideological importance with marxism-leninism and had a special place in the international communist movement
 haalanki, unhen kaafii vivaadit or bhedbhaav failaane vaala netaa bhi mana jaataa he
 lenin ko unke samarthak samaajwaad or kaamkaaji tabake kaa champion maanate hai, jabaki aalochak unhen aisi taanaashaahee satta ke aguva ke rup main yaad karte hai, jo raajnneetik atyaachaar or bade paimaane par hatyaon ke liye zimmedaar rahe
 Leninism lenin kaa vichaar raajnneeti main aane kaa nahi tha, varan usne marxvaadi siddhanth ko janm diya,lenin ko aaj vishwa ke bahut se desho ne naakaara he ,kyonki lenin ke hinsak siddhanth ke kaaran vishwa main hinsa ko badhaava miltaa he
 Lenin has been denied to Lenin by his birth
 aaj bhi kai desho main lenin ke hinsak rukh ko apana rakhaa he iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan he uttar korea 
 Lenin is considered a communist but in reality he wanted a violent system
 lenin ke vichaaro se bahut se log sahamat ho sakate he
 But now many people disagree with his violent views
 isko is prakaar dekha ja saktaa he kii vibhinn desho se lenin kii murat hataai ja rahi he
 Russia also does not consider him its motivator
 ek raashtra ke liye ek rashtravaadi vichaardhaara kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But Lenin, during the war, appealed to the people of Rasiya to take up scripture against Rasiya, which is a declaration for any nation
 isaliye lenin ko rashtravaadi na maanakar ek hinsak aatankwaad ke janak ke rup main dekhnaa uchit hoga
 Yes, it is true that Lenin had an influence on politics, but the bigger truth is that the violent ideology of Lenin is being eradicated today, and the nationalist ideology of proper peace and non-violence is being adopted
 jo kisi bhi raashtra ke liye shreshth kaary he
