 The Adigranth is the main scripture of the Sikh sect
 ise 'guru granth sahib' bhi kehete hai
 It was edited by Sri Guru Arjun Dev Ji, the fifth Guru of Sikhism
 guru granth sahib ji kaa pehla prakaash 16 agast 1604 ko harimandir sahib amritsar main hua
 In Damdama Sahib in 1705, Dashmesh's father Guru Govind Singh Ji completed it by adding 116 words of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, totaling 1430 pages
 gurugranth sahib main maatr sikh guruon ke hi upadesh nahin he, varan 30 anya hindu sant or alang dharm ke muslim bhakton kii vaani bhi sammilit he
 While it speaks of Brahmin devotees like Jayadevji and Parmanandji, the representatives of castes considered hayas in the then Hindu society suffering from caste-based self-discrimination, such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, Sain Ji, Saghna Ji, Chhivaji, Dhanna Speeches are also included

 Guru Granth Sahib is unique in terms of its linguistic expression, philosophical, message

 At the same time, the use of music notes and 31 ragas has also made the introspective esoteric spiritual teachings sweet and sensual

 According to Guruvani, a person gets importance only according to his deeds
 samaaj kii mukhya dhara se katkar sanyas main ishwar prapti kaa saadhan dhund rahe saadhakon ko gurugranth sahib sabak detaa he
 Although Guru Granth Sahib recognizes the importance of introspection, meditation, Guruvani opposes abandonment, inaction, inertia in the name of Sadhana

 'aadigranth' ke antargat sikhon ke pratham paanch guruon ke atirikt unke nawein guru or 14 'bhagaton' kii baniyaan aati hai
 Such a collection probably began to be prepared from the time of Guru Nanakdev and Moradhan, son of Guru Amardas, also preserved the letters of the first four gurus, which the fifth guru rearranged from him and some of the 'bhagats' Including the statements of 'bhai Gurudas', everyone got it written in Gurmukhi

 Its same form is still considered present today

 The first five compositions of 'granth' are famous by the names of 'japunisanu', 'sodru' Mahla 1, 'sunibra' Mahla 1, 'so Purakhu', Mahla 4 and Sohila Mahla respectively, and their 'sirairag' etc
 are divided into 31 ragas
 Come in which the compositions of the first Sikh Gurus are stored according to them
 inke ananthar bhagaton ke pad rakhe gaye hai, kintu bich-bich main kahin-kahin 'baramasa', 'thinti', 'dinarani', 'ghodian', 'siddh goshtee', 'karahale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' aadi jaisi katipay choti badi vishisht rachanaayen bhi jod di gai hai jo saadhaaran lokgeeton ke kavyprakar udaahat karti hai
 Among the posts ranked according to those ragas, the Salok Sahas Kriti, 'gatha' Mahla 5, 'phunhe' Mahla 5, Choubolane Mahla 5, Savaiya Seemukh Vakha Mahla 5 and Mudavani Mahla 5 have been ranked and a ragamala has also been given at the end of all is

 The compositions stored in the 'granth' seem to be somewhat different due to linguistics, mostly providing examples of harmony and uniformity
 aadigranth ko kabhi-kabhi 'gurubaani' maatr bhi kah dete hai, kintu apane bhakton kii drushti main vah sadaa shariri guruswaroop he
 Therefore, like a Guru, he is 'covered' in a high cushion under the moonlight after wearing it in clean silk clothes, pouring flowers on it, offering flowers, taking his aarti and washing his bath in front of him and paying respectfully

 The texts are recited weekly and sometimes monolithically, and some of the lines are recited even when the children are christened, they are initiated and Mangalotsavs are performed or cremated

 a collection of Guru Gobind Singh is famous as 'dasam Granth' which is different and completely different from 'adigranth'

 The Guruvaniyan of Guru Granth Sahib is incarnated in most of the state of Punjab and due to this the common people guess their language like Punjabi; While there is no such a thing

 On the other hand, even though the script of Shri Dasam Granth is Gurmukhi, its language is often poetical in Hindi
 isaki bhashaa punjabi-bhashiyon ke liye or adhik duruh kintu hindi-bhashiyon ke liye bhaleebhanti jaani-pahachaani he

 According to Dr
 Harvilas Sharda, Hammir Dev was the first son of Jaitrasinh and had two brothers, whose names were Suratana Dev and Birama Dev
 doctor dasharath sharma ke anusaar hammir dev jaitrasingh kaa teesraa putr tha vahiin gopinath sharma ke anusaar sabhi putron main yogyatam hone ke kaaran jaitrasingh ko hammir dev atyant priy tha

 His father's name was Jaitrasingh

 When Hammir became the ruler of Ranthambore in 1339, a new chapter in the history of Ranthambore begins
 hammir dev ranthambhore ke chouhaan vansh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee evam mahatvapurn shaasha the

 They have become famous in history as "hathi Hammir"
 jab hammir visan 1339 main ranthambhore ke shaasha bane tab ranthambhore ke itihaas kaa ek nayaa adhyay prarambh hota he
 Hammir Dev was the most powerful and important ruler of the Chauhan dynasty of Ranthambore
 inhone apane baahubal se vishaal samrajya sthapit kar liya tha
 Jalaluddin Khilji attacked Ranthambore in 1347 AD
 sabase pehle usne chhangarh par akraman kiya
 The Muslim army took control of this fort after strong resistance
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore par akraman karne ke liye aage badi
 He attacked to take over the fort, but the Chauhan heroes, led by Hammir Dev, did so much harm to the Sultan, that he was forced to return to Delhi
 chhangarh par bhi chouhanon ne dubaara adhikaar kar liya
 Two years after this attack, the Muslim army invaded Ranthambore again, but they were defeated this time and returned to Delhi
 visan 1353 main sultan jilaluddin khilji kii hatya karke allaudin khilji dilli kaa sultan bana
 He aspired to bring the whole of India under his rule
 hammir ke netritv main ranthambhore ke chouhanon ne apni shakti ko kaaphi sudrudh bana liya or rajasthan ke vistrut bhubhag par apana shashan sthapit kar liya tha
 Alauddin Khilji did not want to see the increasing power of the Chauhans near Delhi, so a struggle was inevitable
 i
sa
 1299 main allaudin kii sena ne gujarat par akraman kiya tha
 They were bringing a lot of loot money from there to Delhi
 maarg main lut ke dhan ke bantwaare ko lekar kuch senanayakon ne vidroh kar diya tathaa ve vidrohi senanayake raav hammirdev kii sharan main ranthambhore chale gaye
 These commanders were Mir Muhammad Shah and Kamru
 sultan allaudin ne in vidrohiyon ko saunp dene kii maang raav hammir se kii, hammir ne uski yah maang thukraa di
 Rao Hammir, following the principles of Kshatriya religion, did not return the soldiers who came to the asylum
 sharan main aae hue kii raksha karnaa apana karttavya samajha
 Alauddin got angry on this and prepared for war on Ranthambore
 allaudin kii sena ne sarvapratham chhangarh par akraman kiya
 He easily got here
 chhangarh par musalamaanon ne adhikaar kar liya he, yah samachar sunakar hammir ne ranthambhore se sena bheji
 The Chauhan army defeated the Muslim soldiers
 muslim sena parajeet hokar bhaag gai, chouhanon ne unka lutaa hua dhan va astr-shastr lut liye
 In 1358 AD, Alauddin Khilji again attacked the Chauhans
 chhangarh main donon senaaon main bhayankar yuddh hua
 In this war, Hammir himself did not go to war
 vir chouhanon ne veertapurvak yuddh kiya lekin vishaal muslim sena ke saamne kab tak tikte
 In the end, the Sultan took control of Chhangarh
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore kii taraf badhane lagi
 The Turkish generals sent information to Hamir Dev, to hand us over to our rebels, whom you have given shelter to
 hamaari sena vaapis dilli laut jaaegi
 But Hammir was firm on his word
 usne sharnaagaton ko saunpane athwa apane rajya se nirvasit karne se spasht manaa kar diya
 The Turkish army laid siege to Ranthambore
 turki sena ne nusrat khan or ulug khan ke netritv main ranthambhore par akraman kiya
 Due to the fort being on a very high mountain, it was very difficult for the enemy to reach it
 muslim sena ne gheraa kada karte hue akraman kiya lekin durg rakshak un par pattharon, baanon kii bauchhaar karte, jisase unki sena kaa kaaphi nuksaan hota tha
 This kind of encirclement of the Muslim army continued for many days
 lekin unka ranthambhore par adhikaar nahin ho sakaa
 Alauddin again sent messengers to Rao Hammir to hand over the rebel soldiers, our army would return to Delhi
 hammir hath purvak apane vachan par drudh tha
 For a long time the circle of the Muslim army continued and the Chauhan army kept on fighting
 allaudin ko ranthambheer par adhikaar karnaa mushkil lag rahaa tha
 He resorted to deceit
 hammir ke paas sandhi kaa prastaav bheja jisko paakar hammir ne apane aadmi sultan ke paas bheje
 Among those men, there was a Surjan Kothari and some crying heroes
 allaudin ne unako lobh laalach dekar apni taraf milaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Some of these secretly turned to the Sultan
 durg kaa dheraa bahut dinon se chal rahaa tha, jisase durg main rasad aadi kii kami ho gai
 The fortress now considered the final decisive war
 rajputon ne kesharia vastra dhaaran karke shaakaa kiya
 The Rajput army opened the fort's doors
 bheeshan yuddh karnaa prarambh kiya
 There was a face-to-face battle on both sides
 ek ore sankhya bal main bahut kam rajput the to duusari ore sultan kii kai guna bady sena, jinke paas paryeti yuddhadi saamagree evam rasad thi
 In front of the might of the Rajputs, the Muslim soldiers could not stand, they ran away leaving the flags of the Muslim soldiers, the Rajputs snatched and the Rajput army returned to the fort
 durg par se raniyon ne musalamaanon ke jhando ko durge kii ore aate dekhakar samajha kii rajput haar gaye atah unhone johar kar apane aapako agni ko samarpit kar diya
 On entering the fort, seeing the flames of Jauhar, Hamir realized his mistake
 usne praayshchit karne hetu kile main sthit shiv mandir par apana mastak kaat kar shankar bhagwaan ke shivlinga par chadhaa diya
 When Alauddin came to know about this incident, he returned and captured the fort
 yah pankti hammir mahakavy main hammir dev chouhan ke bare main likhi gai he is pankti kaa taatpary he ki rajasthan ke ranthambhore samrajya kaa maharaja hammir dev chouhan singh ke samaan gujarata tha arthath usne kabhi chhupakar muqabla nahin kiya wo sher kii bhanti raaj karata tha
 The promise of the word means that King Hammir considered it his first duty to fulfill the promise given to him, and in the same way that the fruit of the Kadali grows once in the same way, in the same way, King Hammir was also angry when he got victory over anger
 
 triya arthath aurat ko shaadi ke vakt ek baar hi tel chadhaane kii rasm hoti he usee prakaar hammir bhi kisi kaary ko baar baar dohraane kii bajaae ek hi baar main puraa karnaa mahatv purna samajhataa tha arthath raja hammir dev chouhan kaa hath uski nidarta kaa pratik rahaa he
 He was the only Chauhan ruler who considered independent rule to be his pride and this self-respect of Hammir Dev Chauhan was heartening to Maharana Pratap and Pratap did not accept the Mughal ruler Akbar's lifetime suzerainty

 According to Dashrath Sharma, Hammir Chauhan defeated King Jayasimha of Mandalgarh Udaipur and kept him captive in Ranthambore, after that Hammir Dev left him on the point that he would continue to give the Ranthambore empire forever and in the interest of every possible Ranthambore empire

 The Nawab of Delhi, Ghazi-ud-din, then incited the Marathas against Surajmal and then the Marathas surrounded the Kumher fort of Surajmal in Bharatpur district from January 1754 to May 1754
 marathe kile par kabja nahin par paae or us ladaai main malhaar raav kaa betaa khande raav holkar maaraa gaya
 The Marathas were determined to kill Surajmal, but the Empress Kishori made a treaty between the Marathas and Surajmal with the help of Scindia

 After the death of Sawai Jai Singh, Surajmal proved the superiority of jat-shakti by giving Vijayashree the weak but right side against the power of seven kings including Marathas and Rajputs in the succession war of 1748

 In fact, the proud and frightened monster of Mughal power had collapsed, the remnants of which were led by Maharaja Suraj Mal, away from luxury and kitsch, carnal, valiant, assistant to the weak, protector of refuge, Prajavatsal, symbol of hindu-muslim unity, nationalist Jat- Power was established
 baad main 1760 main sadashiv raav bhaau or surajmal main kuch baton par anban hui thi
 On seeing the Nabi Masjid of Mathura, Bhau said angrily - Surajmal ji, Mathura has been in your possession for so long, then how did you leave this mosque? Surajmal replied - If i had believed that i would be the ruler of this area for the rest of my life, i might have got this mosque demolished, but what is the use? Tomorrow Muslims will get our temples demolished and build mosques there, would you like it? Later, Bhau ordered the demolition of the roof of the Red Fort, thinking that he would sell his gold and pay his soldiers
 is par bhi surajmal ne use manaa kiya, yahaan tak kaha ki mere se paanch lakh rupee le lo, par ise mat todo, aakhir nadirshah ne bhi is chat ko baksh diya tha
 But Bhau did not agree - when the gold of the roof was broken, it hardly came out of three lakh rupees

 The Marathas neither had full ration nor did they have any distinction of this area, what would the war-hungry soldiers do for many days? If Sadashiv Rao did not quarrel with the small talk with Maharaja Suraj Mal and made him a partner in this war, today the picture of India would have been different
 Maharaja Surajmal still paid the friendship

 The Mughals built the magnificent mausoleums, including the tomb of Humayun, Akbar's father, in Delhi, and the tomb of Akbar, Sikandra, located near Agra
 yah donon hi apane aap main bejod hai
 Under Jahangir the Hindu features vanished from the style; his great mosque at Lahore is in the Persian style, covered with enamelled tiles
 At Agra, the tomb of itmad-ud-daula completed in 1628, built entirely of white marble and covered wholly by pietra dura mosaic, is one of the most splendid examples of that class of ornamentation anywhere to be found
 Jahangir also built the Shalimar Gardens and its accompanying pavilions on the shore of Dal Lake in Kashmir
 He also built a monument to his pet antelope, Hiran Minar in Sheikhupura, Pakistan and due to his great love for the agrawal is the best in bharatpur it is made in tajmahal and originality of the style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the magnificent palaces erected in his reign at Agra and Delhi, the latter one the most exquisitely beautiful in India
 The most splendid of the Mogul tombs, and the most renowned building in India, is the Taj Mahal at Agra, the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Shah jahan
the Moti Masjid in the Agra Fortand The Jama Masjid at Delhi are an imposing building, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts
 In his works Shah Jahan presents himself as the most magnificent builder of Indian sovereigns
 He also built the mausoleum and sections of the huge Lahore Fort that include the impressive Moti Masjid, Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha pavilion which are all enclosed in the fort
 He also built a mosque after himself in Thatta called Shahjahan Mosque
 Another mosque was built during his tenture in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor
 The Taj Mahal, the "teardrop on eternity", was completed in 1648 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died while giving birth to his 14th child
 The extensive use of precious and semiprecious stones as inlay and the vast quantity of white marble required nearly bankrupted the empire
 The Taj Mahal is completely symmetric other than the sarcophagus of Shah Jahan, which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor
 This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in red sandstone, to complement the Mecca-facing mosque place to the west of the main structure
 The Taj Mahal in Agra, India and the Shalimar Garden in Lahore, Pakistan, are two sites which are on the world heritage list of UNESCO
 One can see the architectural similarities and the love for water that the Mughals expressed in many of their buildings
 The Taj is considered to be one of the most beautiful monuments of love and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, when it comes to tourism
 In Aurangzeb's reign squared stone and marble gave way to brick or rubble with stucco ornament
 Srirangapatna and Lucknow have examples of later indo-muslim architecture
 He also added his mark to the Lahore Fort and built one the largest mosques in the city, called Badshahi Mosque
 He also built one of the thirteen gates, and it was later named after him, Alamgir

 Despite being a universal human experience, the formal analysis of old age was first made by Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-harawi in 1532 in his book "ainul Hayat", published by the Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences
 yah pustak budhaape or isse sambandhit muddon par hi aadhaarit he
 The original manuscript of "ainul Hayat" was written in 1532 by the author Mohammad ibn Yusuf al-harawi
 duniya ke vibhinn pustakaalayon main is puraani pandulipi kii 4 pratiyaan maujuud hone kii baat kahi jaati he
 It is said that this is the first article on old age in this world
 in chaaron pratilipiyon kaa milan karne ke baad, 2007 main hakim saiyad jillur rahamaan ne pandulipi kaa sampadan or anuwaad kiya
 With the edited book, you can learn how amazingly 500 years ago the author has discussed all kinds of behavior and lifestyle factors including diet, environment and household conditions in old age

 After a period of complete renewal, organismal aging can be identified by decreased ability to respond to stress, homeostatic imbalance, and increased risk of diseases
 aparivartaneey shrinkhalaa ke ye parivartan anivaary rup se mrityu ke rup main samaapt hote hai
 Some researchers consider old age a disease
 chunki umr par prabhaav daalane vaale jin khoje ja chuke hai, isliye vriddhavastha ko bhi teji se duusare anuvaanshik "prabhaavon" kii tarah sambhavit "upachaar yogya" "sthitiyaan" mana ja rahaa he
 Actually, aging in life is a preventable quality
 iske bajaay, yah ek anuvanshik kaarykram kaa parinaam he
 There are very few signs of aging in many species, the best examples of which are trees such as Bristolcone chirp, fish like sturgeon and rockfish, quahogs and invertebrates such as sea anemones and prawns
 manushyon or anya jaanwaron main, jeevakoshiya budhaape ko prayek koshika chakra main telomar ghataane ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he, jab telomar bahut kam rah jate hai to koshikaayen mar jaati hai
 Therefore, as Hephilic predicted, telomere length is a "molecular clock"
 telomar kii lambaai amar koshikaon main telomar anzime dwaara kaayam rahati he
 In the laboratory, mortal cell lines can be immortalized by activating their telomere genes, which are found in all cells but remain active only in certain cell types
 cancer koshikaon main amar ho kar bina kisi seemaa ke kai guna sankhya badhane kaa gun hona aavashyak he
 This important process against cancer factors applies in 85% of cancer cases, with mutations leading to the re-activation of telomere genes
 chunki yah utparivartan durlabh he, atah telomar "ghadi" ko cancer ke khilaaf rakshaatmak tantra ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Research shows that the clock must be located in the nucleus of each cell, and there have been reports that the longevity clock may be located in the genes of the first or fourth chromosomes of the 23rd pair of human chromosomes

 In particular, calorie reduction has been shown to increase the life span of mice by up to 50%

 kyonki, aanvik str par, umr ko samay kii bajaae koshikaon ke doharaav kii sankhya dwaara gina jaataa he, atah calories bandhan ke is prabhaav ko koshika vruddhi ko kam karke or koshikaon ke vikhandan kii samay seemaa ko badha kar kaayam rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Currently pharmaceutical companies are finding alternatives to mimic the life-enhancing effects of caloric bonding without reducing food consumption

 The divisions of human life span below are not valid for all cultures: umr ko dashak ke anusaar bhi vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: People between the ages of 13 and 19 are also called teen or teenagers
 dashak yaa umr ke dwaara logon kaa varnan karne ke liye "tvantismathing", "thartismathing", aadi samayik shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 In some cultures there are four ways of expressing age: by counting the years including the present year or without it
 For example, for a single person it can be said that he is twenty years old or he has entered the twenty-first year of his life
 roosi samskruti main aam taur par pehali abhivyakti kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, baad vaali kaa upyog simit he: iskaa mrityulekh main ek mrit vyakti kii umr ke liye or ek vayask kii umr ke liye tab prayog kiya jaataa he jab yah darshana aavashyak hota he ki vah uski tulana main kitna / kitni bada / badi tha / thi
 Based on cultural and personal philosophies, old age can be seen as an undesirable phenomenon, which reduces beauty and brings a person closer to death; Or it can be seen as an accumulation of knowledge, a mark of existence and an honorable position
 kuch maamalon main sankhyatmak umr mahatvapurn he, jabaki kai log jivan ke padaavon ko adhik mahatvapurn maanate hai
 The East Asian age census is different from the age census found in Western culture
 paaramparik chini samskruti main saamaanya aayu gyaat karne ke liye jhousui naam kii vidhi ke alaava ek alag prakaar kii vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jise jhusui kehete hai
 In the Jhusui method, at the time of birth people are 1 year instead of 0, as the conception period is already considered the beginning of life, and another difference is Aging Day: Jhusui celebrate their birthday during the Spring Festival , While Shuo An grows up on his birthday
 kis aayu main ek vyakti kanoonee taur par vayask ho jaataa he, is vishay main kai deshon main bhinnataayen hai
 a legal age is defined in many legal systems when a particular person is allowed or allowed to do something
 is main matdaan kii umr, sharaab pine kii umr, sahmati kii umr, vayaskta kii umr, aapraadhik dayitvon kii umr, shaadi kii umr, ummidavaari kii umr or anivaary sevanivruti kii umr shaamil he
 For example, permission to watch a film may depend on the age limit given by the motion picture rating system
 ek bas kiraaya kisi yuva yaa vruddh ke liye riyayati ho saktaa he
 Similarly, in many countries, early defense in jurisprudence is a form of defense in which defenders may argue that they were not liable for their actions at the time the law was broken and therefore liable for the crime Should not be held
 kai adaalatein maanati hai ki kishor maane jane vaale bachaavkarta apni umr ke aadhaar par aapraadhik abhiyojan se batch sakate hai or sandigdh maamalon main apradhi kii umr ko kam karnaa nyyochit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 The economics of aging is also of great importance
 bacchon or kishoron ke paas apana swayan kaa bahut kam dhan hota he, lekin iskaa adhikansh bhaag upabhokta vastuon kii kharid ke liye uplabdh hota he
 They also have a great influence on how their parents spend money
 yuva vayask kahin adhik moolyawaan aayu varg se sambandhit hai
 Often they have a means of income but some responsibilities such as loans and children
 unki khariddaari kii nishchit aadaten nahin hoti or ve nae utpaadon ke prati adhik udaar hote hai
 This is the central target of the youth market
 doordarshan ko 15 se 35 tak kii aayu ke logon ko aakarshith karne ke liye kramadeshit kiya gaya he
 Mainstream films are also made to attract the youth
 pashchimi europe or japan ke kai samaajon main buudhe logon kii sankhya adhik he
 On the one hand, while it has complex effects on society, on the other hand, the impact on health care related needs is also a concern
 vruddh samaajon main lambi avadhi tak dekhbhaal kii maang main apekshit vruddhi se nibatane ke liye vishisht hastkshepon ke liye sahitya main badi sankhya main die gaye sujhaavon ko chaar sheershakon ke antargat sanyojit kiya ja saktaa he: pranali ke pradarshan main sudhaar karnaa; seva dene kii prakriya ko punah dizine karnaa; anaupchaarik kaaryvahakon ko sahaayta pradaan karnaa; tathaa janasankhyikeey maanakon ko badalanaa
 However, the annual increase in national health spending is not primarily due to the growing population of the elderly, but because of rising incomes, new expensive medical technology, decreased number of health care workers and increased information between service providers and patients There are differences
 phir bhi, yah anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki 1970 ke baad se 4
3 pratishat ke chikitsa kharch main vridhon kii jansankhya badhane se vaarshik vruddhi dar main keval 0
2 pratishat ankon kii badhottaree hui he
 Additionally, between 1996 and 2000 there was a 12
5 per cent reduction in spending on home health care by the elderly due to the lack of some reforms in medicine
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki swasthya dekhbhaal laagat par buudhe logon kii aabaadi dwaara padane vaala prabhaav anivaary nahin he
 As of July 2007, an agency's medical costs for a typical prisoner in the United States were up to about $ 33 per day, while for an older prisoner, this cost could be up to $ 100
 adhikansh rajya dastavejon dwaara yah pataa chalata he ki vaarshik bajet kaa 10 pratishat se adhik hissaa buudhe logon kii dekhbhaal par kharch kiya jaataa he
 It is likely to increase in the next 10-20 years
 kuch rajyon ne buudhe kaidiyon ko jaldi reeha karne kii baat kahi thi
 Beginning at the age of thirty, a person's cognitive decline has been shown to decline continuously throughout his age
 anusandhan main smriti or budhaape par vishesh dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he or paaya gaya he ki budhaape ke saath smriti main kai prakaar kii giravat aati he, kintu arth smriti yaa saamaanya gyaan jaisi shabdaawalee paribhaashaon main koi giravat nahin aati nahin, va yah aam taur par badhati he yaa sthir bani rahati he
 Early studies on changes in cognition with age have generally found a decrease in intelligence with aging, but these studies were emotion-oriented rather than ambitious, and therefore the results obtained were a true example of decline rather than a group-specific one
 Can be fabricated by umr badhane ke saath budhimatta main giravat aa sakati he, haalanki isaki dar iske prakaar ke aadhaar par alag-alag ho sakati he or vastav main jivan kii adhikansh avadhi main sthir rah sakati he or logon ke jivan kaa ant nikat aane par isamen anayas giravat aa sakati he
 Therefore individual variations in the rate of cognitive decline can be explained in detail as a reference to different life spans of people
 isamen dimag main parivartan hote hai: haalanki 20 varsh kii umr main neuron kii kam haani hoti he, lekin iske baad prayek dashak ke baad mastishk ke melinated agson kii kul lambaai main 10% kami aati he

 jain sahitya bahut vishaal he
 It is mostly religious literature
 sanskrit, praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main yah sahitya likhaa gaya he
 Magadha has been the center of Mahavira's tendencies, so he gave his sermon here in Ardhamagadhi, the lingua franca which is safe among the available Jain proceeds
 ye aagam 45 hai or inhen shwetambar jain pramaan maanate hai, digambar jain nahin
 According to the Dingbar, the Agama literature has been estranged from time immemorial
 digambar shatkhandgam ko sweekaar karte hai jo 12wein angadrushtiwad kaa ansh mana gaya he
 The language of ancient literature of Digambars is Shaurseni
 aage chalakar apbhransh tathaa apbhransh kii uttarkalin lok-bhashaaon main jain panditon ne apni rachanaayen likhakar bhashaa sahitya ko samrudh banaaya
 In the ancient literature, the texts of Jain literature are found in most number and most authentically
 jain rachanakaaron ne puraana kavy, charit kavy, katha kavy, raas kavy aadi vividh prakaar ke granth rache
 Swayambhu, Pushp Dant, Hemachandra, Somprabha Suri etc
 are the main Jain poets
 inhone hinduon main prachlit lok kathaon ko bhi apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or parampara se alag uski parinti apane matanukool dikhaai
 The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 ye aagam 46 hai- The Agam Granth is quite ancient, and the place which is of Vedas in Vedic literature and of Tripitaka in Buddhist literature, the same place is of Agamas in Jain literature
 aagam granthon main mahavir ke upadeshon tathaa jain samskruti se sambandh rakhane vaali anek katha-kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 According to Jain tradition, after 160 years of Mahavira Nirvana, there was a great downturn in Magadha countries, due to which the Jain monks had to relocate elsewhere
 dushkaal samaapt ho jane par shraman patliputra main ekatrit hue or yahan khand-khand karke gyaarah angon kaa sankalan kiya gaya, barahawaan ang kisi ko samaran nahin tha, isliye uskaa sankalan na kiya ja sakaa
 This conference is known as 'pataliputra-vachana'
 kuch samay pashchaat jab aagam sahitya kaa phir viched hone laga to mahavir nirvana ke 827 yaa 840 varsh baad jain saadhuon ke duusare sammelan hue
 One in Mathura under the chairmanship of Aryaskandil and the other under the chairmanship of Nagarjuna Suri
 mathura ke sammelan ko 'maathuri-vaachana' kii sangya di gayi he
 Then after about 150 years, 980 or 993 years after Mahavira Nirvana, the fourth conference of sadhus was held in Vallabhi under the chairmanship of Devardhigini Apology, in which the proceeds were systematically compiled for the last time
 se 'valbhi-vaachana' ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 The present proceeds are the form of this concept
 jain aagmon kii ukt teen sankalanaaon ke itihaas se pataa lagata he ki samay-samay par aagam sahitya ko kaaphi kshati uthaani padi, or yah sahitya apane moulik rup main surakshit nahin rah sakaa
 This seems to be the reason that this literature is very less compared to the Buddhist literature, and it was probably due to the disorder in this literature that the Digambara sect refused to accept it
 isa ke purv lagbhag chauthi shatabdi se lagaakar isvi san paanchavi shatabdi tak kii bharatvarsh kii aarthik tathaa saamaajik dasha kaa chithran karne vaala yah sahitya anek drushtiyon se mahatva kaa he
 a detailed description of the ethos of Jain monks in texts like Ayarang, Suyagand, Uttarajhayana, Daswayaliya etc
, it corresponds very much to the Buddhist Dhammapada, Suttanipat and Mahabharata, etc
, and according to the statement of scholars like Dr
 Vintranese, that shramana
 - symbolizes poetry
 bhashaa or vishay aadi kii drushti se jain aagmon kaa yah bhaag sabase pracheen maaloom hota he
 In texts like Bhagwati Kalpasutra, Owaiah, Thanang, Nirayavali, Shramana gives a detailed description of Lord Mahavira, his Chariya, his teachings and the erstwhile king, prince and his war, which reveal many of the endangered practices of Jain history
 nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavadasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, vivagasuy aadi granthon main mahavir dwaara kahi hui anek katha-kahaniyaan tathaa unki shishy-shishyaaon kaa varnan he, jisamen jain parampara sambandhi anek baton kaa parichay miltaa he
 Many important topics related to Vaastu Shastra, music, flora, etc
 are described in the texts like Raipanesya, Jeevabhigam, Pannavana, which is not available elsewhere
 chhedsutron main saadhuon ke aahaar-vihaar tathaa praayshchit aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisaki tulana baudhon ke vinayapitak se kii sakati he
 It is told in the Vrhatkalpasutra that when Mahavira Saket was a monk in a garden called Subhumibhaga, at that time he allowed his monks and nuns to visit the monastery in the east of Saket, up to Kaushambi of Daksai, and to Kunala in the north
 isse pataa lagata he ki armbh main jain dharm kaa prachaar simit tha, tathaa jain shraman magadh or uttar pradesh ke kuch hisson ko chhodkar anyatra nahin ja sakate the
 Of course, this part of the Holesutras is as ancient as Mahavira himself
 tatpashchaat raja kanishka ke samakaleen mathura ke jain shilalekhon main bhinn-bhinn gana, kul or shakhaon kaa ullekh he, vah bhadravahu ke kalpasutra main varnit gana, kul or shakhaon ke saath praayah mail khaataa he
 This also reveals the authenticity of Jain scriptures
 vastutah is samay tak jain parampara main shwetambar or digambar kaa bhed nahin maaloom hota
 The resemblance of Pali Tripitaka in the subject, language etc
 of Jain proceeds also reflects the antiquity of this literature
 pali-sutron kii attakathaon kii tarah aagmon kii bhi anek tikaa-tippaniyan, deepika, nivritti, vivaran, avchuri aadi likhi gayi hai
 This literature can be divided into four divisions, namely, Nirukti, Bhashya, Churni and Tika, combining Agam and it is called 'panchangi'
 aagam sahitya kii tarah yah sahitya bhi bahut mahatva kaa he
 In this, the subject of Agams is given in detail
 is sahitya main anek anushrutiyaan surakshit hai, jo aitihaasik drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 There is a wide variety of archaeological material in the commentaries, such as large-scale, practical, practical, nihilakrini, essentials, essentials, Uttarayana tika, etc
, due to which India’s customs, fair festivals, monks, cults, times, floods, thieves, robbers, sartwahs, trade The routes, crafts, art, food, houses, jewelery, etc
, throw a lot of light on various subjects
 lok-katha or bhashaa shaastra kii drushti se bhi yah sahitya bahut mahatva kaa he
