 Rahim has chosen for example in poetry the scripts of texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana and Gita and has tried to explain the temporal life behavior aspect by him, which offers a glimpse of Indian culture
 abdurrarahim khaankhaana kaa janm sanwat 1613 i

 Incidentally at that time, Humayun was present with the military in Lahore to resist the invasion of Alexander Suri

 When Rahim was five years old, his father Bairam Khan was killed in 1561 in Patan Nagar, Gujarat

 As a royal dynasty, Rahim was given the title of 'mirza Khan'

 At the end of education, Akbar got Rahim married to his daughter's daughter Mahabano
 iske baad rahim ne gujarat, kumbhalaner, udaipur aadi yudhon main vijay praapt kii
 On this, Akbar honored Rahim with the highest title of his time, 'mirarj'
 san 1584 main akbar ne rahim ko khan-e-khaanaa kii oopaadhi se sammanit kiya
 Rahim died in 1627 at the age of 71

 rahim ne swayan hi apane jeevankaal main iskaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 Humayun chose Bairam Khan for the education of Crown Prince Akbar and appointed Akbar's guardian in the last days of his life, giving him the responsibility of managing the state
 bairam khan ne kushal niti se akbar ke rajya ko majboot banane main puraa sahyog diya
 For some reason there was a difference of opinion between Bairam Khan and Akbar
 akbar ne bairam khan ke vidroh ko safaltaapurvak dabaa diya or apane ustad kii maan evam laaj rakhte hue use haj par jane kii ichha jataai
 As a result, Bairam Khan left for Haj

 As soon as Akbar came to know about the incident, he sent a message to Sultana Begum to return to the court
 raste main sandesh paakar begum akbar ke darbar main aa gai
 At such a time, Akbar, giving proof of his greatness, gave shelter to him with great generosity and said to Rahim, "keep it happy in all ways
" ise yah pataa na chale ki inke pita khan khaanaan kaa saaya sar se uth gaya he
 Baba said to Jambur that this is our son
 ise hamaari drushti ke saamne rakhaa karo
 In this way, Akbar raised Rahim just like a son of religion
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat akbar ne vidhwaa sultanaa begum se vivaah kar liya
 Akbar honored Rahim with the title of "mirza Khan" as per the royal family
 rahim kii shiksha- diksha akbar kii udaar dharm- nirpeksh niti ke anukool hui
 Due to this education, the poetry of Rahim remains a thunderous neck of the Hindus even today
 dinakar ji ke kathananusaar akbar ne apane deen-ilaahi main hindootv ko jo sthaan diya hoga, usase kai guna zyada sthaan rahim ne apni kavitaaon main diya
 It is said about Rahim that he was a Muslim by religion and a pure Indian by culture

 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
 Rahim was married at the age of about sixteen

 Max Penn is a third-party shooter in which the player assumes the role of its titular character, Max Penn
 takreeban puure gemple main khel ke dushmano ko haraane ke liye bullate time bandook-ladaai shaamil he
 Its levels are generally straight and flat, with only a few levels being plastered and containing puzzle-solving elements
 khel kii kahani ko khilaadi maiks ke aatanrik ekalaap kaa anusaran karte hue aage badhaata he, chunki vah khilaadi kaa aglaa qadam kya hona chahie yah doharaata rahata he
 Many levels of the game include Penn's realistic-symbolic horror dreams and drug-related illusions
 praarambhik taur par ek 9mm arddh-swachaalit pistaul hi khilaadi kaa ekmaatr hathiyaar hota he
 As the player progresses, they will find the Beretta 92 and Desert Eagle hands, pump action, saw-off and automatic panker jackhammer shotguns, Ingram and Colt Commando sub-machine guns, M79 grenade launcher, a scope bolt-action rifle, and melee
 And gain access to other weapons including hand grenades
 khel ke kuch hathiyaar dodhari ho sakate hai
 Max recovers with the help of painkillers collected by the player
 is khel kaa aadhaar purv-likhit kamaanon par vyapak rup se nirbhar he: dushmano ke budhimatta bhare zyaadaatar vyavhaar purv-nirdhaarit hote hai, masalan - cover lenaa, khilaadi se peeche hatana, yaa grenade phenkna aadi
 Max Penn's game play revolves around bullet time, a form of slow motion - when the shotgun is pressed, the speed of time slows down so much that the movements of the bullet can be seen with open eyes
 And enables Max to perform special combat postures
 haalanki pen kii harakatein bhi dhimi ho jaati hai lekin khilaadi tab bhi dushmano par adwitiya laabh lete hue lakshya kii taraf sthiti banane tathaa sahi vaqt main pratikriya dene yogya hota he
 Sometimes when the last of the enemy's side is killed, a third person is shown moving around his fallen body; In the same way, the camera follows the path of the bullet fired from the sniper rifle
 khilaadi kaa charitra kuch pistaul evam rifl kii goliyaan khaane yaa sateek shotgan visphot ke baad mar jaataa he
 Most enemies have more stamina than the player's character, in which enemies can survive two to three times more than Max despite inflicting plenty of damage
 duusare tareeqon se waar karne par bhi dushmano par koi asar nahin padataa
 adhik kathinaaiyon vaale str behad chunauti bhare hai; "ded on arival" game mod khilaadi ko prati adhyay keval saat bachaav kii seemaa main baandh detaa he or "new york minute" mod khilaadi ko aavantit samay se pehle prayek adhyay puraa karne ko baadhya karata he - dushmano kaa safaya karte-karte vah thak jaataa he
 Upon finishing the game "dead on Arrival", the player opens "the Last Challenge", which features a fight in continuous bullet time against the "killer Suite" hitmen armed with a Panker Jackhammer
 kahani ghatnaon ke bich bich main kahi gayi he or isamen "da american dream", "a cold de in hell", evam "a bit closer tu heaven" naamak teen mukhya adhyay hai
 The game begins in the winter of 2001, when New York City recovers from the worst blizzard experience in its history

 Max runs to help his family but by then it is too late - his wife and their newborn daughter have been brutally murdered
 apane parivaar ke dah sanskaar ke baad pen kaa tabadalaa DEA main ho jaataa he
 Three years later Max Penn may be employed as a secret worker within the Pashinello mafia family responsible for the smuggling of Valkyr
 uskaa DEA sahakarmi B
B use duusare DEA agent or maiks ke ghanishtha mitra elex balder se new york shahar ke NYC subway stesan main milane ke liye kahata he
 When Max arrives in the subway, there is an underground bullet
 chunki vahaan vah panshanilo aparaadh giroh ke ek mafia sargana maubster jaik lupino ko apni goli kaa nishaanaa banaata he, jisane us stesan main ek bank luutane kii koshish kii thi
 While returning to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is then killed by an unknown assassin
 chunki maiks kii gupt pahchaan se keval balder hi vaakif tha, pen apni NYPD kii pahchaan kho baithta he or is qatl kii shaq kii sui uski or gum jaati he
 Apart from this, the mafia comes to know that he is a police man and his name is given to betel nut
 aage kii jaanch or lupino kii khoj ke dauraan maiks ek walkir drug saude par chapa martha he or use pataa chalata he ki roosi maubster vladimir lem panshinelo ke aadamiyon ke saath ladaai main laga hua he
 In the end Max gets Winnie Gognity, Lupino's quintessential man; He chases Goganity across the city and injures him and eventually discovers Lupino's whereabouts
 pagal lupino ko goli maarane ke baad pen ek mahila hatyarin mona sex se miltaa he, jo apane sharaab ke pyaale main walkir milaayaa karti he
 In this condition, Max finds Mafia and tortures her

 He is persuaded to kill Vladimir's traitors aboard the Sharon, a cargo carrier on the banks of the Brooklyn River

 After saving a bombing at the mafia restaurant Casa Di Angelo, Max Dawn uses newly-made Russian weapons to drive out the residents of Puchenillo, where he finds the corpse of Mona's sister, Lisa Puccinello
 jab pen ki ankhon ke saamne rahasyamay asir korporation kaa krur CEO nichol horn maafioso ko maar rahaa hota he, tab maiks ko pataa chalata he ki don walkir bazaar kaa ek kathputli maatr he
 Horn injects Max with an extra volume of Valkyr and leaves him to die
 tab use nashe kii haalat main ek daraavna sapana aata he or vah apane parivaar ko na bachaa paane kii aatanrik pidaa or glani se guzarataa he
 Also, the letters allegedly written by his wife tell him that he is a character from a video game and a graphic novel
 nashe kii atyadhik maatra se ubarne or jaagane ke baad pen apane ekmaatr makasad ko puraa karne ko udyat hota he, jo use ek gupt sainya anusandhan company ke upar sthit ek steel foundry tak le jaataa he
 There he learns that Valkyr is the result of the Valhala project, which was designed by the US Army in the 1990s to improve soldiers' endurance and morale after the preceding Ladder experiment
 yah pariyojna karaab parinaamon kii vajah se tezi se roak di gayi lekin ise horn tathaa asir ne punah shuru kar diya
 use yah bhi pataa chalata he ki uski patni ko sanyogvash us pariyojna ke bare main pataa chal gaya tha tathaa horn ne walkir pareekshan ke matt logon ko uske ghar main chhod diya tha
 Asir begins a suicide "operation Dead Eyes" underground bunker to get rid of evidence and witnesses, including scientists
 maiks aakhri pal main us bunker se bhaag khadaa hota he
 Then Max gets a phone call from BB, who organizes a meeting at a garage site
 B
B
 bataata he ki elex ko usne maar giraaya tha or uski maut ke liye usee ne maiks ko fansaa diya tha
 Max then chases him and a gun fight ensues throughout the garage
 us gaddaar ko maarane ke baad maiks ko alfred woden naamak ek vyakti kaa phone aata he, jo use asuard building main aane ke liye kahata he
 Alfred describes himself as part of a powerful secret society called the "inner Circle", which has deep ties to the government
 inner sarkal ke sadsy maiks ko nichol horn kii pahchaan ke bare main bataate hai or kehete hai ki "apane haath bandhe" hone ke kaaran ve khud uskaa peechha nahin kar sakate the
 They ask Max to kill Horn, instead of which they could free him from any criminal charges leveled against him
 asuard par tab asir ke agent hamalaa kar dete hai or goli lagane kaa bhaan kar lete maiks tathaa woden ko chhod kar baithak main maujuud har insaan ko maar daalate hai
 Max fights his way out
 maiks asir korporation ke behad sangrakshit ucch-pradyogiki vaale suraksha karyaalay main pahunchataa he or ek sashastr helicopter ke hawaii hamale se bachate-bachaate building ke top tak pahunch jaataa he
 He meets Mona Sachs in the elevator again but Max is shot by Horn's men over his head when he refuses to shoot
 jab maiks lift main waapas jaataa he to uski laash gaayab ho chuki hoti he
 Eventually Max is confronted by Nicole, who escapes through the roof and rides in a helicopter
 maiks imaarat ke taron ko udaata he jo tut kar helicopter par girte hai or horn ko maar daalate hai
 The plot of the game reaches its starting point
 new york city police department immergency sarvice unit drishy main aati he or maiks ko giraftaar kar use imaarat ke baahar laati he, jahaan use alfred woden miltaa he
 Max smiles knowing that Woden will get Max acquitted from the judicial system
 maiks pen ek bhagoda DEA agent or purv NYPD jasoos he, jisaki patni mishael or unki navjaat beti kaa qatl walkir drug maamle main kar diya gaya tha
 Max goes undercover in the crowd and eventually becomes the only surveillance army member, just like Punisher
 apane parivaar kii maut ke zimmedaar logon se pratishodh lene ke uske junun ko rokane main lagi police se bachate-bachaate vah saikadon aparaadhiyon or shadyantrkariyon ko maar giraata he
 Max is the definition of a naïve boy film noir - a man who gets caught in bad circumstances against his will
 maiks bahut ekaaki he or vaastaviktaa ke prati unki bhaavana bahut hi naatakeey or shaileepurn he
 He is an introvert and takes his qualities to the extreme, using semi-figurative self-assertions to express his feelings about his antics, atmosphere and situation
 khel kii shuruyaat main maiks alag tarah kaa dikhataa he - ek ujjwal vyaktitv vaala bahirmukhi, khushhaal shaadi-shuda insaan
 hatyaon ke baad maiks apane jivan kaa arth kho baithta he or vah apane jivan ke ekmaatr makasad - pratishodh - ke liye aankh moond kar kaam karata rahata he
 Penn shows his guilt to be alive all the time and makes his position contradictory - though he believes his life to be in "one New York minute", but expresses his utterly gloomy and bleak outlook towards the world Despite his inner monologue, he has an intense liveliness
 jahaan ek ore apane parivaar ke paas pahunchane ke liye usamen marane kii teevr ichha he, vahiin vah apana pratishodh lene ke liye zindaa bhi rahanaa chahta he
 Penn is a protagonist, as he says "I wasn't one of them, i wasn't a hero"
 On the other hand, Max is not a morally dubious proponent - he does not assassinate Winnie Gognity and tries to get information from the Finito Brothers "playing Bogart" rather than firing a gun with a gun in his hand
 Max tries only one thing - and that is to avenge his loved ones, which he justifies
 haalanki usne apni bhaawanaaon kaa galaa puri tarah se nahin ghont diya - vah pehali baar milane par mona sex ke saath jaataa he or apradhi vladimir lem kaa dost banataa he, jiskaa koi saathi nahin
 baharhaal ise vipareet rup se bhi dekha ja saktaa he: ho saktaa he maiks mona se isliye ghulaa mila ho kyonki usne uski jaan bakshi or apni patni ke haal hi main marane ke baavjood use ek saathi kii talash ho; or vladimir se dosti kii kyonki vah uske dushmano kaa dushman tha
 Max's identity is his intricate and bizarre use of his metaphors and rhetoric expressing his situation and the world around him, however he does not use them with his colleagues and others
 His use of metaphors is "internal" and never externally expressed; Max tells the truth and often Penn's inner thoughts contrast with his interactions with people
 yah khel kahani ko maiks ke nazariye se dobaaraa kahe jane dwaara prastut karata he
 In Max Penn's character formation, 3D Realms wanted to "develop a more robust character that would be the foundation for the exclusive rights to a new game
 Almost the same as we did with Duke Newchem
" " khel ko sheershak charitra ko khel ke lekhak sam lake kii tarz par banaaya gaya tha; lake ne graphic upanyaas cat seenon ke liye bhi kapade pahane tathaa yah bhoomika nibhaai
 aisa majaak he ki maiks main ek kabz jaisaa asahaj aadha muskuraataa, aadha nakchadha bhav he; yahaan tak ki is mazaaq kaa zikr agali kadi main bhi he
 However, Lake left the role for Max Penn 2, and after an intense process of character selection, the developers chose actor Timodi Gibbs to model Max Penn

 Most elements of the game are named after personalities from Norse mythology
 haalanki ise aksar khel ke finnish deveopment company, remedi intertenment ke scandinavian viraasat ke hukum ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 This is a misconception; Although Finland is often combined with other Nordic countries, Finnish mythology is actually quite different from its counterpart Norse
 sambhav he ki apni vishesh sthiti ke liye prashansa ke maddenzar ye vishay saadhaaran rup se khel main shaamil kar liye gaye hon
 The Asir Corporation, the most frequently mentioned in the game and the main source of the Valkyr drug, is named after The Asir at the Temple of the Norse Gods
 asir korporation kii mukhiya nichol horn he; regnarok myth main gjalarorn ne regnarok ke prarambh kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The snowfall during the events of this game is in reference to the epic winter fimbulvettar that preceded Ragnarok
 walkir nasha ek kaalpanik sainya pradarshan vardhak he jo iske upyogkartaaon ko adrinalin se matt hatyaron main parinat kar detaa he, jinhen mrityu kii bhramaatmak chhaviyon kii anubhuti hoti he
 Valkyries of Norse mythology used to be female warriors, whose job was to keep watch on the battlefield 'mortifier'
 ve veerta se shahid hue logon ko le jaati thim
 The Valhalla Project at Max Penn is a government-funded conspiracy that developed Valkyr to increase the combat capability of American soldiers during the Gulf War
 norse puranic kathaon main valhala walkiries dwaara chune gaye logon kii jeevanoparant avadhi thi; valhala kii aabaadi vaale log devon ke yuddh main norse devon kii ore se yuddh karenge
 The computer network of Valhala Base is named Yagdrasil, in reference to the tree that connects the nine worlds of Norse universe science
 jaik lupino ke gothic nitaclub ragnarok norse akashwani ragnarok kii tarz par rakhaa gaya he; asir or rakshakon ke bich kaa ek yuddh jiske parinamswaroop bahut si deviyon kii mrity ho gayi or unhone is duniya main waapas janm liya
 Lupino's surname refers to Fenris Wolff, since Lupino is a reference to the wolf's Latin name Lupus
 norse puranic kathaon main phenris volf devon dwaara baandha gaya ek vishaal bhediya he, lekin yah antat itnaa vishaal ho jaataa he ki ragnarok ke dauraan bandhan chhudaa kar bhaag khadaa hota he
 Alfred Woden's surname refers to Woden
 woden norse devalayas ke ek pramukh dev odin kaa anglo-sexon sanskaran he; woden ke aankh kaa dhabba bhi odin ko sanderbhit karata he jisane budhimatta or gyaan ke liye apni ankhon kaa balidaan diya tha
 Max Asgard meets Woden and the Inner Circle in the building: Asgard is the Norse Realm, in which the gods reside
 maiks ke saathi DEA agent elex balder ko uskaa saathi B

 In Norse mythology, when a fountain or arrow of Amarabel is hit in the chest of a balder, he dies

 Max's bullet time ability seems to be a mirror of those Norse warriors

 The GBA version of the game was developed in 2003 by Mobius Entertainment Limited
 chunki iskaa vikaas tulanaatmak rup se ek behad kam shaktishaalee placeform par kiya gaya tha, yah sanskaran computer sanskaran or iske exbox evam plastesan 2 port se kaaphi alag he: 3D shooter ke bajaay yah khel sprit graphic par aadhaarit he or ise ek chitrasam pariprekshya se dikhaaya gaya he
 However apart from the perspective the features of the game are largely similar to its origins, including a polygon field graphic for its characters

 Remedy Entertainment developed the idea of a "third party action fight" after completing the Death Rally in late 1996
 yah pehle loded se or tadnantar tomb redar kii safalataa se prerit tha
 According to the game's story and screenwriter Sam Lake, for him "the starting point was a personal vision, the real specimen of the harshest peak" used in a game with a "darker, more psychological" story
 a game prototype and design papers of the project with the executive titles Dark Justice and Max Heat were soon produced and featured in 3D Realms, which signed a development agreement and construction began

 This is the first time in the history of Indian film, when a new language has been created for a film
 bharat ke pracheen samrajyon main se ek mahishmati, kii rani shivagaamee, ek vishaal jalprapaat ke nikat kii maand se ek shishu ko god liye baahar aati he
 She boldly kills the soldiers in her pursuit and sacrifices her own life to protect the baby
 ain samay par, sthaneey gramin pani main dubi rani kii upar uthi baanh main shishu ko dekh lete hai or us bachche ko surakshit bachaa lete hai
 In this way the queen merges by drowning in the falling waterfall from the height of the mountain
 sanga evam uske pati us shishu kaa naam shiva rakhte hai or apane balak samaan hi parvarish karte hai
 As time passes, Shiva grows up to be a powerful young man who aspires to climb mountains and tries unsuccessfully at times
 ek roj use jalprapaat main behate hue kisi yuvati kaa mukhauta miltaa he
 Desiring to find the identity of the young woman, he attempts a mountain climb again and eventually succeeds
 jalprapaat ke shikhar par, shiva us mukhute kii maalik avanatika ko khoj nikaalata he, ek vidrohi yoddha jiskaa dal gorilla paddati ke jariye mahishmati samrajya ke raja bhallaal dev / pallavathevan ke viruddh yuddh lard rahaa he
 The goal of the party is to rescue the former queen Devasena, who has been confined in the palace for the last 25 years in the palace
 or yah mahatvapurn jimmevary avanatika ko saunpa gaya he
 Avanatika loves to hear Shiva saying that he has come only for her while climbing all the difficulties of this waterfall
 shiva ab is abhiyaan ko apane jimme lene vachan detaa he or chhipate-chhupate hue mahishmati main pravesh kar devsena ko kaid se mukt karaata he
 Shiva redeems him and escapes with him, but soon the king's royal slave Kattappa, who is known for his excellent battle skills, follows him
 magar ghaat lagaae bhadraa, bhallaal dev kaa putr, achaanak hi shiva ke sar par waar karata he, magar katappa apane shastr gira detaa he jab use maaloom hota he ki shiva asal main mahendra bahubali he, divangat raja amrendra bahubali kaa putr
 Then here the past events of King Amarendra Baahubali which happened in the past are mentioned
 amrendra kii mata kii mrityu uske janm pashchaat hota he, jabaki pita usase kaaphi purv hi guzar chuke hote hai
 Sivagami, with the support of his bodyguard Katappa, takes over the reins of the empire until the new king is elected
 vah amrendra bahubali tathaa bhallaal dev ko samaan rup se parvarish detii he, unhen kala, vigyaan, chal-vidya, raajnneeti or yuddh kala jaise kai vidyaon evam prashikshan main paarangat kiya jaataa he, magar donon main hi samrajya ke shashan kii abhilaashaa bhinn rahati he
 While Amarendra treats Bahubali moderately towards the people, Bhallal Dev is extremely tough and takes every possible ruthlessness to achieve his goal, even he kills Bahubali
 jab mahishmati ko shatru kalaakeyas dwaara yuddh kii chunauti milti he, shivagaamee vachan detii he ki jo koi bhi kalaakeyas ke raja kaa sir katkar laaegaa use nayaa raja bana diya jayega or is tarah donon natinon ke bich barabari se yuddh sadhano kaa bantwaare kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 But Bhallal Dev's handicapped father, Bijjala Deva, provides more and more fighting tools to Bhallal by deceit
 yuddh main jab mahishmati ek dfa asafal hokar apana ant samaj leti he, amrendra apane sainikon ko uske saath mrityu se hi ladane ko punah prerit karata he or shatruon ko kuchalakar yuddh samaapt karata he
 But Bhallal Dev already kills the king of Kalakeya, Sivagami chooses Amarendra Bahubali as the new ruler over his decision of superiority and leadership in the battle, making Bhallal Dev the commander for his courage and valor
 
 is purv ghatnaon ke baad, jab raja amrendra ke bare main prashn kiya gaya, to bhavuk katappa raja ke dehanth hone kii baat kahata he, or katappa swayan ko hi unki mrityu kaa jimmedaar bataata he

 The residents of Barabai village used to harass the villagers with British and English hegemony
 paariwarik kalah ke kaaran narayan laal ne apni patni vichitra devi evam donon putron - muralidhar va kalyanmal sahit apana paitruk gaanv chhod diya
 After leaving his village, only two of his brothers - Aman Singh and Saman Singh - remained in Barabai, whose descendants still live in the same village

 Later, this family moved to Shahjahanpur, the historical city of Uttar Pradesh
 shahjahanpur main munnuganj ke phatak ke paas sthit ek attaar kii dukaan par maatr teen rupee masik main narayan laal ne naukari kar lee
 His family did not have the support of so little money
 bismil kii daadi vichitra devi ne apane pati kaa haath bataane ke liye anaaj pisane kaa kaary shuru kar diya
 This sequence continued for about two-three years
 unke aachaar-vichaar, tyanishtha va dharmik pravriti se sthaneey log praayah unhen "pandit ji" kahkar sambodhit karte the
 He also had a benefit from this that on every Teej - festival, donations - Dakshina and food etc

 After some time he also quit this job and started the business of selling Regari
 isse unhen pratidin paanch-saat aane kii aay hone lagi

 unase purv ek putr paidaa hote hi mar chukaa tha
 Seeing the traces of the cycle in the child's horoscope and the two fingers of both hands, an astrologer predicted - "if the child's life is somehow saved, although the chances are very low, then it will be possible to make any person in the world Strength will not stop
 '' mata-pita donon hi singh raashi ke the or baccha bhi singh-shaavak jaisaa lagata tha atah jyotishiyon ne bahut soch vichaar kar tula raashi ke namakshar r par naam rakhane kaa suzav diya
 Both parents were worshipers of Rama, so the child was named Ramprasad
 maan moolmati to sadaiv yahi kahati thim ki unhen ram jaisaa putr chaiye tha
 Everyone in the house used to call the child lovingly as Rama
 ramprasad ke janm se purv unki maan ek putr kho chuki thim atah jaadu-tone kaa sahaara bhi liya gaya
 a rabbit was brought and removed from the top of the newborn child into the courtyard
 khargosh ne aangan ke do-chaar chakkar lagaaye or fouran mar gaya
 It is mentioned by Ram Prasad Bismil in his autobiography
 muralidhar ke kul 9 santaanen huin jinamein paanch putriyaan evam chaar putr the
 Later, two daughters and two sons also died
 balykaal se hi ramprasad kii shiksha par vishesh dhyaan diya jane laga
 His mind was more in play but less in reading
 iske kaaran unke pitaaji to uski khub pitai lagaate parantu maan hameshaa pyaar se yahi samajhaati ki "betaa ram! ye bahut buree baat he mat kiya karo
 "this loving learning must have had some effect on his mind
 uske pita ne pehle hindi kaa akshar-bodh karaayaa kintu u se ullu na to unhone padhanaa siikhaa or na hi likhakar dikhaaya
 In those days only the owl was taught in Hindi alphabet
 is baat kaa vah virodh karte the or badale main pita kii maar bhi khate the
 Defeated, he was admitted to the Urdu school
 shaayad yahi prakritik gun ramprasad ko ek krantikari bana paye
 At the age of 14, Ramprasad got addicted to stealing money from his father's ark
 churaaye gayi rupayon se unhone upanyaas aadi kharidkar padhanaa prarambh kar diya evam cigarette pine va bhang chadhaane kii aadat bhi pad gayi thi
 Overall, the trend of money-theft continued and Ramprasad was now used to reading books of novels and ghazals filled with Urdu premiers
 sanyog se ek din bhang ke nashe main hone ke kaaran ramprasad ko chori karte hue pakad liya gaya
 Plenty of beating, novels and other books were torn but the habit of stealing money was not lost
 aage chalakar jab unako thodi samaj aayi tabhi ve is durgun se mukt ho sake
 Ramprasad started studying English when he did not pass the Urdu Middle examination
 saath hi pados ke ek pujari ne ramprasad ko puja-paath kii vidhi kaa gyaan karvaa diya
 The priest was a settled scholar
 unke vyaktitv kaa prabhaav ramprasad ke jivan par bhi padaa
 Due to the teachings of the priest, Ramprasad began to practice celibacy with the recitation
 pujari kii dekha-dekhi ramprasad ne vyaayaam karnaa bhi prarambh kar diya
 All the misgivings and bad habits of adolescence were in mind
 keval cigarette pine kii lat nahin chhuti
 But she too, after a few days, escaped from the discord of Sushil Chandra Sen, a schoolmate
 cigarette chhootane ke baad ramprasad kaa man padhai main lagane laga
 Very soon he entered the fifth record of English
 ramprasad main apratyaashit parivartan ho chukaa tha
 The body had become handsome and robust
 niyamit puja-paath main samay vyateet hone laga tha
 During this time he got in touch with Munshi Indrajit who came to the temple
 munshi indrajit ne ramprasad ko arya samaaj ke sambandh main bataaya or swami dayanand saraswati kii likhi pustak satyarth prakaash padhane ko di
 The serious study of Satyarth Prakash had a surprising impact on Ramprasad's life
 ramprasad jab government skool shahjahanpur main aathvin kaksha ke chaatr the tabhi sanyog se swami somdev kaa arya samaaj bhawan main aagaman hua
 Munshi Indrajit appointed Ramprasad to Swamiji's service
 yaheen se unke jivan kii dasha or disha donon main parivartan prarambh hua
 a serious study of Satyarth Prakash on the one hand and an open discussion on political subjects with Swami Somdev on the other hand aroused the feeling of patriotism in his mind
 san 1916 ke congress adhiveshan main swagatadhyaksh pan jagat narayan 'mullah' ke aadesh kii dhajjiyaan bikherte hue ramprasad ne jab lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak kii puure lakhanu shahar main shobhaayatra nikaali to sabhi navayuvakon kaa dhyaan unki dridhta kii ore gaya

 This book was published in 1916 in Kurmi Press, Lucknow under the management of Babu Ganeshprasad
 ramprasad ne yah pustak apni mataji se do baar main do-do sau rupee lekar prakashit kii thi
 He has mentioned this in his autobiography
 yah pustak chhapate hi jabt kar lee gayi thi baad main jab kakori kand kaa abhiyog chalaa to sakshya ke rup main yahi pustak prastut kii gayi thi
 Now this book has been edited and compiled in part-three of Sarfaroshi's book titled Tamanna and can be seen in many other libraries including Teen Murti Bhawan Library, New Delhi

 He formed an organization under the guidance of Pandit Gandalal Dixit under the name Matriwadi
 is sanghathan kii ore se ek ishtihaar or ek pratigya bhi prakashit kii gayi
 In order to collect funds for the party, Ramprasad, who had become famous as 'bismil' till now, also committed two robberies in June 1918 and one in September 1918, making the police alert of these youths
 There were raids all over the place in search
 26 se 31 disambar 1918 tak dilli main laal kile ke saamne hue congress adhiveshan main is sanghathan ke navayuvakon ne chilla-chilla kar jaise hi pustaken bechnaa shuru kiya ki police ne chapa daalaa kintu bismil kii sujh boojh se sabhi pustaken batch gayin

 Among those who were decorated, except for Mukundilal, in February 1920, the general amnesty was released
 bismil puure 2 varsh bhumigat rahe
 Some of his teammates went to Shahjahanpur and spread the rumor that Bhai Ramprasad was killed by a police bullet while the truth was that he jumped in the Yamuna during the police encounter and floated miles inside the water with the power of yoga practice
 Going far ahead, came out of the river and where the Greater Noida is inhabited nowadays, the uninhabited people went to the ravines
 vahaan un dinon keval babul ke hi vriksh hua karte the; or oosar jameen main aadmi to kahin dur-dur tak dikhataa hi nahin tha
 Ram Prasad Bismil took refuge in Rampur Jagir, a small village here and roamed in the uninhabited forests for several months, grazing the cow buffalo of the village goose
 iskaa bada hi rochak varnan unhone apni aatmakatha ke dwitiya khand : swadesh prem main kiya he
 While living here, he wrote his revolutionary novel, The Action of the Bolsheviks

 a very good Bengali book of Arvind Ghosh, Hindi translation of the compound instrument was also done while he was underground
 yamuna kinare kii jameen un dinon police se bachane ke liye surakshit samajhi jaati thi at: bismil ne us niraapad sthaan kaa bharpoor upyog kiya
 At present, since this village comes under the Beta Forest Sector of Greater Noida, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has developed the immortal Shaheed Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan in the memory of the Forest Department's reserved land in the area of rampur Jagir village
 Which is supervised by the Forest Department of the state with the funding of Greater Noida Administration
 'bismil' kii ek visheshta yah bhi thi ki ve kisi bhi sthaan par adhik dinon tak thaharte nahin the
 Staying at Rampur Jagir for a few days, he also stayed in Kosma District Mainpuri, the village of his real sister Shastri Devi
 maje kii baat yah ki unki apni bahan tak unhen pahchaan nahin paayin
 Walked out of Kosma and reached Bah
 kuch din bah rahe phir vahaan se pinahat, agra hote hue gwalior riyasat sthit apane dada ke gaanv barbai chale gayi

 All his colleagues liked this book very much

 He introduced him to some publishers in Calcutta, including one Ummadatta Sharma, who later published a book titled Catharine by Ram Prasad Bismil in 1922
 san 1921 ke ahmedabad congress adhiveshan main ramprasad'bismil' ne purna swaraj ke prastaav par moulana hasarat mohani kaa khulkar samarthan kiya or antatogatva gandhi ji se asahyog aandolan prarambh karne kaa prastaav paarit karvaa kar hi maane
 Due to this he became very popular among the youth
 samooche desh main asahyog aandolan shuru karne main shahjahanpur ke swayamsevakon kii aham bhoomika thi
 But when Gandhiji withdrew the non-cooperation movement after consulting Chauri Chaura in 1922, in the Congress of 1922, Bismil and his colleagues opposed Gandhiji in such a way that two ideologies were formed in the Congress again - a liberal or Liberals and Second Rebel or Rebellion
 gandhi ji vidrohi vichaardhaara ke navayuvakon ko congress kii aam sabhaaon main virodh karne ke kaaran hameshaa hulladbaj kaha karte the

 If seen, it was his great visionary thinking at that time

 In this revolutionary published in English as The Revolutionary, the ideological thinking of revolutionaries * can be understood well

 Seeing this 4-page manifesto published as The Revolutionary, the British government started searching for its author in Bengal

 Similarly, as soon as Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee got a party meeting from Kanpur, he got off the train at Howrah station that he was caught with a lot of copies of the HRA Constitution
 unhen hazaribagh jail main band kar diya gaya
 After the arrest of both the prominent leaders, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh as well as the revolutionary members of Bengal came on the shoulders of Ram Prasad Bismil
 bismil kaa swabhaav tha ki ve yaa to kisi kaam ko haath main lete na the or yadi ek baar kaam haath main le liya to use puraa kiye bagaiyr chhodte na the
 There was a need for money for the work of the party earlier, but now it has increased even more
 kahin se bhi dhan praapt hota na dekh unhone 7 march 1925 ko bichpuri tathaa 24 may 1925 ko dwarkapur main do raajnneetik dakaitiyaan daaleen
 But he could not get any special money in them
 in donon dakaitiyon main ek-ek vyakti maukey par hi maaraa gaya
 Due to this, Bismil's soul suffered immensely
 antatah unhone yah pakkaa nishchay kar liya ki ve ab keval sarkari khajaana hi lootenge, hindustan ke kisi bhi rais ke ghar dakaiti bilkul na daalenge
 a decision was made at an emergency meeting held on 7 August 1925 at his house in Shahjahanpur and on 9 August 1925, a total of 10 people led by Bismil from Shahjahanpur railway station, including Ashfaq Ulla Khan, Rajendra Lahiri, Chandrashekhar Azad, Shacheendranath Bakshi, Manmathanath Gupt, Mukundi Lal, Keshav Chakraborty, Murari Sharma and Banwari Lal, boarded the 8 Down saharanpur-lucknow passenger train

 The range of these mausers was also higher than that of ordinary pistols
 un dinon ye moujar aaj kii e ke - 47 raifal kii tarah charchit the
 Stopping at Kakori railway station before Lucknow, as soon as the train moved forward, the revolutionaries pulled the chain and stopped it and dropped the box of government treasury from the guard compartment
 use kholane kii koshish kii gayi kintu jab vah nahin khulaa to ashfak ulla khan ne apana moujar manmathanath gupt ko pakadaa diya or hathaudaa lekar baksaa todane main jute gayi
 Manmathnath Gupta eagerly pressed the trigger of the Maujar, causing the missed bullet to the passenger named Ahmed Ali
 vah maukey par hi dher ho gaya
 In a hurry, a sheet of leather filled with silver coins and notes was tied in sheets and a sheet was left there to escape from there
 agle din akhabaaron ke madhyam se yah khabar puure sansar main fail gayi
 The British government took this train robbery seriously and handed over the task of investigating the fastest police in Scotland, under the leadership of Mr
 RA Harton, an assistant to the D

G
 si ai di ne gambheer chaanbin karke sarkaar ko is baat kii pushti kar di ki kakori train dakaiti krantikariyon kaa ek suniyojit shadyantr he
 The police put up advertisements in all the prominent places to give information in connection with the Kakori case and announce the reward for arresting any person involved in the conspiracy
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki police ko ghatnasthal par mili chadar main lage dhobi ke nishaan se is baat kaa pataa chal gaya ki chadar shahjahanpur ke hi kisi vyakti kii he
 On inquiring from the dhobis of Shahjahanpur it was found that the chadar was of Banarasi Lal
 banarsi laal se milakar police ne sara bhed praapt kar liya
 It was also known that on 9 August 1925, who were his partymen from Shahjahanpur went out of the city and when did they return? When intelligence was confirmed that Ram Prasad Bismil, the leader of HR was not in the city that day, then on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was accompanied by more than 40 people from all over India
 Was arrested
 kakori kand main keval 10 hi log vaastavik rup se shaamil hue the at: un sabhi ko namjad kiya gaya
 Except five of them - Chandrashekhar Azad, Murari Sharma, Keshav Chakraborty, Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Shachindra Nath Bakshi, who did not come into the hands of the police, the remaining people were prosecuted and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment
 
 faraar abhiyukton ke atirikt jin-jin krantikariyon ko ech aar e kaa sakriy kaaryakarta hone ke sandeh main giraftaar kiya gaya tha unamem se 16 ko sakshya na milane ke kaaran reeha kar diya gaya
 Special Magistrate Ainuddin did not leave any stone unturned to spoil the image of each revolutionary
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, cese ko seshan court main bhejne se pehle hi is baat ke sabhi sakshi va sakshya ekatra kar liye the ki yadi apil bhi kii jaye to ek bhi abhiyukt bina sajaa ke chhootane na paye
 The police broke Banarasi Lal in the lockup, fearing severe punishment
 shahjahanpur jila congress cameti main party-fund ko lekar isi banarsi kaa bismil se jhagada ho chukaa tha
 Bismil, who was then the Auditor of the District Congress Committee, suspended Banarasi from the primary membership of the Congress party, proving allegations of embezzlement in the party fund
 baad main jab gandhi ji 16 oktober 1920 ko shahjahanpur aaye to banarsi ne unase milakar apana paksh rakkha
 At that time, Gandhiji made a reconciliation between the two, saying that they should not give so much money to the small hera-hai
 parantu banarsi bada hi dhoort aadmi tha
 He first apologized to Bismil and then took Gandhiji aside and filled his ears that Ramprasad is a very criminal type
 ve isaki kisi baat kaa na to swayan vishwaas karen na hi kisi or ko karne den
 Later, this Banarasi Lal befriended Bismil and gained his trust before sweet talks and then became a partner in the cloth business with him
 jab bismil ne gandhi ji kii aalochana karte hue apni alag party bana lee to banarsi laal atyadhik prasann hua or maukey kii talash main chup saadhe baitha rahaa
 The police, knowing the difference between Bismil and Banarasi's previous quarrel with the local people, made Banarasi Lal an approver and used it as an infallible tool in the entire prosecution against Bismil
 banarsi laal vyapaar main saajheedaar hone ke kaaran party sambandhi aisi-aisi gopneey baaten jaanata tha, jinhen bismil ke atirikt or koi bhi na jaan saktaa tha
 It is mentioned by Ram Prasad Bismil in his autobiography
 lakhanu jila jail, jo un dinon sanyukt praant kii central jail kehalaati thi, kii 11 nambar barrack main sabhi krantikariyon ko ek saath rakkha gaya or hajratganj chauraahey ke paas ring theatre naam kii ek aaleeshaan building main asthai adaalat kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 This building, named Ring Theater, used to be between Kothi Hayat Bakhsh and Mallika Ahad Mahal, in which British officers used to entertain themselves by watching movies and drama etc
 isi ring theatre main lagaataar 18 maheene tak king emperor varses ram prasad 'bismil' and adars ke naam se chalaaye gayi aitihaasik mukademe main british sarkaar ne 10 lakh rupee us samay kharch kiye the jab sone kaa mulya 20 rupee tola hua karata tha
 This building was also demolished later by the orders of the British rulers, and in its place in 1929-1932, a second grand building was named as GPO Lucknow
 1947 main jab bharat aaazaad ho gaya to yahan gandhi ji kii bhavy pratimaa sthapit karke rahi sahi kasar nehru sarkaar ne puri kar di
 When the non-congress Janata government was first formed at the center, at the time of the Kakori martyr's half-century celebrations organized in 1977, with the collective efforts of the surviving revolutionaries of that time, the Kakori pillar was unveiled by Uttar Pradesh Governor Ganpatirao Devrao Tapase here so that the site May the memory of is aitihaasik mukademe main sarkari kharche se harkarannath mishra ko krantikariyon kaa vakil niyukt kiya gaya jabaki jawaharlal nehru ke rishte main saale lagane vaale suprasiddh vakil jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko ek sochi samajhi ranneeti ke antargat sarkari vakil banaaya gaya
 Jagat Narayan left no stone unturned to get all the revolutionaries punished severely
 yah vahi jagat narayan the jinaki marji ke khilaaf san 1916 main bismil ne lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak kii bhavy shobhaayatra puure lakhanu shahar main nikaali thi
 Irked by this, in the Mainpuri conspiracy, the same Mullaji insisted on his status as a government lawyer, but he could not expose even one child of Ram Prasad Bismil as Bismil escaped in the Mainpuri conspiracy and for two years, the police only Do not come

 Though none of these accused got involved in this scheme for their personal benefit but since neither has done any remorse over their work nor has pledged to keep themselves away from such activities in future hence Whatever punishment has been given has been thoughtfully done and in this condition no exemption of any kind can be given in it
 phir bhi, inamen se koi bhi abhiyukt yadi likhit main pashchaatap prakat karata he or bhavishya main aisa na karne kaa vachan detaa he to unki apil par apper court vichaar kar sakati he

 When Bismil argued against the verdict in fluent English in front of the Chief Court, then Mulla ji, the public prosecutor, looked at the armpits

 "the court was irritated by this reply and rejected the plea made by Bismil on 18 July 1927 itself
 uske baad unhone 76 prishth kii tarkpurna likhit bahes pesh kii
 After reading it, the judges expressed doubt that Bismil had written this debate by some jurist instead of writing it himself

 The trial of Kakori case was going on in Lucknow

 He used the word "mulajim" instead of "muljiman" for the accused
 phir kya tha, pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne tapaak se un par ye chutili fabti kasi: "mulajim hamako mat kahiye, bada afsos hota he; adaalat ke adab se ham yahan tasharif laaye hai
 We turn around with our juridis; That we have also lit lamps in the intestines often

 Then they did not cross-examine that day

 According to the judgment which was given on 22 August 1927, Ram Prasad Bismil, Rajendra Nath Lahiri and Ashfaq Ullah Khan were imprisoned for life under 121 and 120 of IPC, and 302 and 396 according to hanging and Thakur Roshan Singh

 Finally, a delegation of five persons headed by Madan Mohan Malaviya went to Shimla and met the Viceroy and prayed that all these four accused had written to the government that they would undertake any such activity in future

 Despite this the Viceroy flatly refused him

 But the judges of London and the legal advisors of the emperor argued very strongly that Ram Prasad Bismil, the architect of this conspiracy, is a very dangerous and professional criminal
 yadi use kshamaadaan diya gaya to vah bhavishya main isse bhi bada or bhayankar kand kar saktaa he
 In that case it will be impossible for the government to rule in India
 is sabakaa parinaam yah hua ki privi kauncil main bheji gayi kshamaadaan kii apil bhi khaarij ho gayi
 On 16 December 1927, Bismil completed the last chapter of his autobiography and sent him out of prison

 In the figure of Tipu, the British used to see a picture of Napoleon

 This fortification led to his defeat
 He relied heavily on the Franciscans and regarded the powers of the native kings as he was as autocratic and independent as his father, but still cherished the sufferings of the subjects

 Cornwallis knew that his war with Tipu was inevitable
 or isliye mahaan shaktiyon ke saath vah mitrataa sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He entered into a joint front against Tipu by entering into an alliance with the Nizam and Marathas and after that he declared war against Tipu, thus the Third Mysore War started
 This war lasted for two years, initially the British failed but in the end It was won

 The Marathas also got some share which led to the border of their kingdom to Tangbhadra, the remaining parts were kept by the British
 Tipu Sultan gave his two Pugas as Carnatic to the Carnavalis
 This defeat caused Tipu Sultan to lose a lot of his power
 The state company was surrounded by the state and their contact with the sea was broken
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki cornwalis ne is sandhi ko karne main jaldbaaji ki or tipu kaa purna nivas nahin kar ke bhul ki agar vah tipu kii shakti ko kuchal detaa to bhavishya main chaturth misur yuddh nahin hota lekin vastav main cornwalis ne aisa nahin karke apni doordarshta kaa parichay diya tha us samay angreji sena main bimaari faili hui thi or europe main englad or france ke bich yuddh kii sambhaavana thi aisi sthiti main tipu francisiyon ki sahaayta le sakate the agar sampoorn rajya ko angrej british rajya main mila letaa to marathe or nizaam bhi usase jalane lagate isliye cornwalis kaa uddeshy yah tha ki tipu kii shakti samaapt ho jaae or saath hi saath company ke mitra bhi shaktishaalee nahin ban sake isliye unhone bina apane mitron ko shaktishaalee banaaye tipu kii shakti ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 Tipu Sultan was deeply saddened by this humiliating treaty and due to his infamy, he wanted to overcome the British and overcome, Prakriti gave him such an opportunity but fate did not support Tipu, at this time there was war going on in England and France
 To benefit from the international situation, Tipu sent his Rajdoot to different countries and he gave the Franciscans various types of facilities in their state

 He decided to crush Tipu's power against Tipu
 He succeeded in tying up with the Nizam and the Marathas to combine the Nizam, but the Marathas did not give a clear answer
 In 1798, Wellejali entered into an alliance with the Nizam and this Announced that some part of the conquered territories should also be given to the Marathas
 With full preparation, Wellejali attacked Mysore in this way
 Ddh began
 prarambh se hi tipu sultan ek parakramee yodha the
 By the end, the British died in Mysore while fighting, thus 33 years ago, the Muslim power which had emerged in Mysore did not just end, but the drama of the British Mysore war ended
 misur jo 33 varshon se lagaataar angrejon ki pragati kaa dushman bana tha ab vah angrejon ke adhikaar main aa gaya tha angrej or nizaam ne mil kar misur kaa batwaaraa kar liya kuch hissaa angrejon ko mila or kuch par nizaam kaa adhikaar sweekaar kiya gaya maraathon ko bhi uttar pashchim main kuch pradesh diye gayi lekin usne lene se inkaar kar diya bachaa hua misur rajya misur ke puraane hindu rajvansh ke ek naaballik ladke ko de diya gaya or uske saath angrejon ne ek sandhi ki is sandhi ke anusaar misur kii suraksha kaa bhaar angrejon par aa gaya vahaan british sena tainaat kiya gaya sena kaa kharch misur ke raja ne dena sweekaar kiya
 The British benefited greatly from this policy, the kingdom of Mysore became very small and the enemy of the enemy came to an end, it increased the power of the company considerably, it returned the part of the Marathas and as a result, Mysore was surrounded by the British from all sides
 He raised in the future which greatly helped in the development of British power and one day he established his suzerainty over the whole of India
