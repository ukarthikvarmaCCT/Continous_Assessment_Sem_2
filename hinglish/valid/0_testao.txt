 i came to know that till recently, if a soldier was injured in the CRPF, he was discharged on hospitalization

 But this demand from the paramilitary forces has seen narcissism in some circles of the army
 2 june ke hindustan times ke chandigarh sanskaran main ritair leftinent general harvant singh ne likhaa he ki kendriya police bal khud ko ardhsainik bal maanakar van rank van pension kii maang karne lage hai
 According to Harwant Singh, Assam Rifles and Rashtriya Rifles, BSF CRPF is not a paramilitary force in India
 ek or antar bataaya he ki 85 fisadi sainik 35-37 saal kii umr main ritair hote hai jabaki police vaale 60 saal kii umr main
 The comments ritair leftinent harvant singh ne yah bhi likhaa he ki police bal ke jawan isliye maare jate hai kyonki unki training karaab hoti he
 They do not have the right fighting equipment
 biguef ko bataanaa chahie ki unke rahete teen karod bangladeshi kaise bharat main ghus aae
 Harwant Singh also said that onions should not be compared to apples
 kaaran jo bhi ho ardhsainik balon kaa yogadan itnaa bhi kam nahin he ki unhen seb kii tulana main pyaaz bataaya jaae
 Lieutenant Harwant Singh should have avoided this comparison
 ek sawaal to isi par he ki sena kii maang ko puraa karnaa sarkaar ke liye aasaan he yaa nahin
 Are our soldiers ready to give some time to the government? ardh sainik balon kii maang par bhi baat karenge
 There are only two guests, we will talk comfortably
 goa main pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar chune jane ke baad 15 sitambar 2013 ko narendra modi kii pehali raily hoti he haryana ke rewadi main
 a large number of ex-servicemen and retired officers went to listen to Narendra Modi at this rally
 manch par bhi purv sena pramukh ve
 K
 singh, rajyavardhan rathore maujuud the
 In this rally of ex-soldiers, Narendra Modi also shared the regret of not being able to study in Sainik School in childhood and being admitted to the army
 unhone kaha ki main kai saalon se van rank van pension ke bare main sun rahaa hum
 What is the problem? aaj main bharat sarkaar se publikali sabhi army ke logon or purv sainikon kii ore se maang karata hum ki wo van rank van pension skim par white paper lekar aaen
 Friends, i can say with the claim that if Vajpayee ji's government was formed in 2004, it would not have complicated the issue of One Rank One Pension
 vaise pradhanmantri ne man kii baat main yah nahin bataaya ki 1999 ke bijepi ke menifesto ke rashtriya suraksha ke kollam main pension se judi sabhi kamiyon ko dur karne kaa vaada kiya gaya tha
 Even when the UPA government announced the imposition of One Rank One Pension in February 2014, Narendra Modi had said that UPA is fraudulent
 jab hamaari sarkaar aegi tab ham lagu karenge
 After a year, when the anxiety started growing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured in his mind that different departments of the government are working on it
 main jitna maanata tha utana saral vishay nahin he, pechida he or chalis saal se usamen samasyaon ko joda gaya he
 i have engaged everyone in government to find a way towards simplification
 pal pal kii khabar media main dena zaruri nahin hota he
 i assure that my government will continue to solve the issue of One Rank One Pension
 is masale par chandigarh ke sanskarnon main kaaphi lekh mili hai
 This may be due to the many retired army officers living in Chandigarh
 pradhanmantri ke man kii baat ke baad tribune main sena ke purv vaais cheef ritair leftinent general vijay obray ne talkhi bharaa lekh likhaa or kaha ki pradhanmantri ke is mudde ko pechida bataane or time frem nahin dene se yah mudda ghumphir kar apni jagah par pahunch gaya he
 'we are not football but respected and loyal citizens of the country and society
 yah masalaa isliye nahin lataka hua he ki jatil he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in public that i am in favor of One Rank One Pension but bureaucrats do not want this
 leftinent general obray ne 2010 main bani koshyari cameti kii yaad dilaai
 The chairman of this committee was BJP MP Bhagat Singh Koshyari
 koshyari cameti ne is maang ko jaays mana tha
 If it costs 9100 crore to implement this demand, then can the country not bear such a burden for its soldiers and officers
 ' This is a matter related to millions of soldiers and officers
 jo ritair ho chuke hai or jo abhi seva main hai donon ke liye
 One Rank One Pension is easy to understand
 1996 main koi major general ke pad se ritair hote hai or aaj koi leftinent karnal ke pad se ritair hota he to ho saktaa he ki rank main senior hone ke baad bhi major general kii pension leftinent karnal se kam ho
 This difference is several thousand
 isliye kaha ja rahaa he jo jis rank se ritair hoga use usee ke hisaab se pension diya jayega
 The defense minister's statement was further exacerbated by the soldiers' restlessness
 unhen laga ki sarkaar taalane ke mood main he
 On May 29, at a military function in Pune, some retired officers refused to take the honor to the Defense Minister
 parrikar ne kaha ki mantralay ne sari aupchaarikta puri kar lee he lekin prakriya samay leti he
 People are not aware of financial complications
 mere raksha mantri bane ke baad se ye skim 22000 karod kaa aankada chhu gai he
 On May 30, Parrikar said that we cannot give a date when we will implement
 unhone kaha ki hamane paanch saal ke liye vaada kiya tha
 Not for a year
 jabaki 2014 main bajet ke baad parrikar ne kaha tha ki agle bajet main van rank van pension lagu ho jayega
 This statement increased the resentment so much that the Prime Minister had to explain in his mind
 iske baad bhi sainik 14 june ko apni is maang ko lekar vyapak pradarshan kii yojana par kaayam hai
 In February 2014, the UPA is talking about giving 500 crores, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 1000 crores in his first budget and now 8300 crores
 un 1500 karod kaa kya hua pataa nahin he
 The Prime Minister has also said in his mind that running commentary cannot be done for everything
 vaise is ladaai ko ladate hue 35 saal ho gaye
 The Supreme Court, which implemented One Rank One Pension for the soldiers, had to face the problem of One Rank One Pension for its judges also
 april 2014 main tatkaaleen chif justise pi sadashivam ne faisla diya tha ki hai court or supreme court ke jajon ke ritair hone ke baad sab ko samaan suvidha milani chahie
 There should be no difference on the basis that someone has been promoted from the lower court to the High Court
 koun kahaan se chalata hua jaj bana he is aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 Doing so would be a violation of sections 14 and 16 (1) of the Constitution
 sanvaidhanik padon par baithe logon main van rank van pension kaa niyam hona hi chahie
 Seeing the army approaching the One Rank One Pension, 6 paramilitary forces are also demanding One Rank One Pension
 mujhe pataa chalaa ki haal philhal tak siarpief ko koi jawan ghayal ho jaataa tha to aspataal main bhartee hone par chuttee cat jaati thi
 Now it is considered as duty
 lekin ardhsainik balon kii is maang se sena ke kuch halkon main narazgi dekhi ja rahi he
 In the Chandigarh edition of the Hindustan Times of June 2, Retired Lieutenant General Harwant Singh has written that the central police forces, considering themselves as paramilitary forces, have started demanding One Rank One Pension
 harvant singh ke anusaar bharat main assam rifles or rashtriya rifles, biguef siarpief koi ardhsainik bal nahin he
 Another difference is that 85% of the soldiers retire at the age of 35-37 years while the policemen at the age of 60 years
 tippaniyan Retired Lieutenant Harwant Singh has also written that the soldiers of the police force are killed because their training is poor
 unke paas ladane ke thik upkaran nahin he
 BSF should tell how three crore Bangladeshi entered India during their stay
 harvant singh ne yah bhi kaha ki pyaaz kii tulana seb se nahin kii jaani chahie
 Whatever the reason, the contribution of the paramilitary forces is not so low that they are said to be more onion than apple
 leftinent harvant singh ko is tulana se bachanaa chahie tha
 One question is whether it is easy for the government to fulfill the demand of the army
 kya hamaare sainik sarkaar ko kuch vakt dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 The paramilitary will also speak on the demand of the forces
 do hi mehmaan hai ham aaraam se baat karenge
 He said that i have been hearing about One Rank One Pension for many years
 isamen dikkat kya he
 Today, i publicly request the Government of India on behalf of all the army people and ex-servicemen to bring a white paper on the One Rank One Pension Scheme
 mitron main daawey ke saath kah saktaa hum ki agar 2004 main vaajapeyi ji kii sarkaar banati to yah van rank van pension kaa mudda jatil na hota
 However, the Prime Minister did not say in his mind that the National Security column of the 1999 BJP manifesto promised to remove all the pension deficiencies
 farvari 2014 main jab upie sarkaar ne van rank van pension lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kii tab bhi narendra modi ne kaha tha ki upie frod kar rahi he
 We will implement when our government comes
 ek saal baad jab ise lekar bechaini badhane lagi to pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane man kii baat main bharosa dilaayaa ki sarkaar ke bhinn-bhinn vibhaag is par kaam kar rahe hai
 It is not a simple subject as i believed, it is complicated and problems have been added to it for forty years
 maine saral banane kii disha main sarkaar main baithe hue sabko raste khojane par lagaaya hua he
 It is not necessary to give news of the moment to the media
 main vishwaas dilaataa hum ki meri sarkaar van rank van pension ke masalaa kaa hal laakar rahegi
 Many articles have been found in Chandigarh editions on this issue
 chandigarh main sena ke kai ritair afasar rahete hai is vajah se bhi ho saktaa he
 Following the Prime Minister's mind, former Vice Chief of Army Staff in the Tribune Lieutenant General Vijay Oberoi wrote a scathing article and said that due to the Prime Minister's complicity and not giving time frame, this issue has swung into its place
 
 'ham footbal nahin he balki desh or samaaj ke sammanit or nishthavan naagarik hai
 This issue does not hang because it is complicated
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne public main kaha tha ki main van rank van pension ke haq main hum magar naukarshah aisa nahin chaahate hai
 Lt
 General Oberoi reminded the Kosariari Committee formed in 2010
 is cameti ke adhyaksh bijepi ke saansad bhagat singh koshyari the
 The Koshyari Committee accepted this demand as legitimate
 agar is maang ko lagu karne main 9100 karod kaa kharchaa aata he to kya desh apane javaanon or afasaron ke liye itnaa bhaar nahin uthaa saktaa he
 ' lakhon sainikon or afasaron se judaa maamla he ye
 For both those who have retired and those who are still in service
 van rank van pension ko samajhnaa aasaan he
 In 1996, one retires from the rank of Major General and today one retires from the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, then even after being senior in rank, the Major General's pension may be less than the Lieutenant Colonel
 yah antar kai hazaar kaa hota he
 Therefore, it is being said that the rank from which he will retire will be given pension accordingly
 sainikon kii is bechaini ko raksha mantri ke bayaan ne or badha diya
 They felt that the government was in a postponement
 29 may ko pune main sainikon ke ek samaaroh main kuch ritair afasaron ne raksha mantri ke haathon sammaan lene se manaa kar diya
 Parrikar said that the ministry has completed all the formalities but the process takes time
 logon ko vittiya jatiltaaon kaa pataa nahin he
 Since i became the Minister of Defense, this scheme has touched the figure of 22000 crores
 30 may ko parrikar ne kah diya ki ham koi taarikh nahin bataa sakate ki kab lagu karenge
 He said that we had promised for five years
 ek saal ke liye nahin
 Whereas after the budget in 2014, Parrikar had said that One Rank One Pension will be implemented in the next budget
 is bayaan se naaraazgi itani badi ki pradhanmantri ko apane man kii baat main safai deni padi
 Even after this, on June 14, the soldiers are planning a comprehensive demonstration on this demand
 farvari 2014 main upie ne 500 karod, vitt mantri arun jetali ne apane pehle bajet main 1000 karod or ab 8300 karod diye jane kii baat ho rahi he
 What happened to those 1500 crores is not known

 farvari 2014 main upie ne 500 karod, vitt mantri arun jetali ne apane pehle bajet main 1000 karod or ab 8300 karod diye jane kii baat ho rahi he
 What happened to those 1500 crores is not known
 pradhanmantri ne bhi man kii baat main kaha he ki har baat kii running camentry nahin kii ja sakati he
 By the way, it has been 35 years of fighting this battle
 sainikon ke liye van rank van pension lagu karne vaale supreme court ko apane jajon ke liye bhi van rank van peshan kii samasya se jujhna padaa tha
 In April 2014, the then Chief Justice p Sadasivam ruled that all should get equal facility after the High Court and Supreme Court judges retire
 is aadhaar par antar nahin hona chahie ki koi nichali adaalat se pramot hokar hoicourt tak pahunchaa he
 There should not be discrimination on the basis of who has become a judge
 aisa karnaa samvidhan kii dhara 14 or 16(1) kaa ulanghan hoga
 There should be a rule of one rank one pension among those sitting on constitutional posts
 sena ko van rank van pension ke kareeb pahunchate dekh 6 ardhsainik bal bhi van rank van pension kii maang karne lage hai
 i came to know that till recently, if a soldier was injured in the CRPF, he was discharged on hospitalization
 ab jake ise duty mana gaya he
 But this demand from the paramilitary forces has seen narcissism in some circles of the army
 2 june ke hindustan times ke chandigarh sanskaran main ritair leftinent general harvant singh ne likhaa he ki kendriya police bal khud ko ardhsainik bal maanakar van rank van pension kii maang karne lage hai
 According to Harwant Singh, Assam Rifles and Rashtriya Rifles, BSF CRPF is not a paramilitary force in India
 ek or antar bataaya he ki 85 fisadi sainik 35-37 saal kii umr main ritair hote hai jabaki police vaale 60 saal kii umr main
 The comments ritair leftinent harvant singh ne yah bhi likhaa he ki police bal ke jawan isliye maare jate hai kyonki unki training karaab hoti he
 They do not have the right fighting equipment 
 biguef ko bataanaa chahie ki unke rahete teen karod bangladeshi kaise bharat main ghus aae
 Harwant Singh also said that onions should not be compared to apples
 kaaran jo bhi ho ardhsainik balon kaa yogadan itnaa bhi kam nahin he ki unhen seb kii tulana main pyaaz bataaya jaae
 Lieutenant Harwant Singh should have avoided this comparison
 ek sawaal to isi par he ki sena kii maang ko puraa karnaa sarkaar ke liye aasaan he yaa nahin
 Are our soldiers ready to give some time to the government? ardh sainik balon kii maang par bhi baat karenge
 There are only two guests, we will talk comfortably
 leftinent general obray ne 2010 main bani koshyari cameti kii yaad dilaai
 The chairman of this committee was BJP MP Bhagat Singh Koshyari
 koshyari cameti ne is maang ko jaays mana tha
 If it costs 9100 crore to implement this demand, then can the country not bear such a burden for its soldiers and officers
 ' This is a matter related to millions of soldiers and officers
 jo ritair ho chuke hai or jo abhi seva main hai donon ke liye
 One Rank One Pension is easy to understand
 1996 main koi major general ke pad se ritair hote hai or aaj koi leftinent karnal ke pad se ritair hota he to ho saktaa he ki rank main senior hone ke baad bhi major general kii pension leftinent karnal se kam ho
 This difference is several thousand
 isliye kaha ja rahaa he jo jis rank se ritair hoga use usee ke hisaab se pension diya jayega
 The defense minister's statement was further exacerbated by the soldiers' restlessness
 unhen laga ki sarkaar taalane ke mood main he
 On May 29, at a military function in Pune, some retired officers refused to take the honor to the Defense Minister
 parrikar ne kaha ki mantralay ne sari aupchaarikta puri kar lee he lekin prakriya samay leti he
 People are not aware of financial complications
 mere raksha mantri bane ke baad se ye skim 22000 karod kaa aankada chhu gai he
 On May 30, Parrikar said that we cannot give a date when we will implement
 unhone kaha ki hamane paanch saal ke liye vaada kiya tha
 Not for a year
 jabaki 2014 main bajet ke baad parrikar ne kaha tha ki agle bajet main van rank van pension lagu ho jayega
 This statement increased the resentment so much that the Prime Minister had to explain in his mind
 iske baad bhi sainik 14 june ko apni is maang ko lekar vyapak pradarshan kii yojana par kaayam hai
 In February 2014, the UPA is talking about giving 500 crores, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 1000 crores in his first budget and now 8300 crores
 un 1500 karod kaa kya hua pataa nahin he
 The Prime Minister has also said in his mind that running commentary cannot be done for everything
 vaise is ladaai ko ladate hue 35 saal ho gaye
 The Supreme Court, which implemented One Rank One Pension for the soldiers, had to face the problem of One Rank One Pension for its judges also
 april 2014 main tatkaaleen chif justise pi sadashivam ne faisla diya tha ki hai court or supreme court ke jajon ke ritair hone ke baad sab ko samaan suvidha milani chahie
 There should be no difference on the basis that someone has been promoted from the lower court to the High Court
