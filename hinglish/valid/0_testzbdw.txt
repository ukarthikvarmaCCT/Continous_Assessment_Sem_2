 However, due to his numerical superiority, the Nairs were able to retain Hindu dominance in Travancore

 In Kerala, which Swami Vivekananda referred to as the "madhouse of castes", there existed a system of untouchability and caste discrimination that prevailed until the mid-20th century

 According to Kerala tradition, Dalits were forced to maintain a distance of 96 feet from the Namboodris, 64 feet from the Nairs and 48 feet from the other upper castes, as they were believed to have tainted them
 anya jatiyaan jaise ki naidi, kanisan or mukuvan ko nairon se kramshah 72 feet, 32 foot or 24 feet tak manaahi thi
 Numerous socio-religious reform movements took shape from late 1800s, which were also the initial democratic mass movements of Kerala

 The influence of market economy, the abolition of traditional military training, the absorption of new values through the new system of education, the awakening of self-consciousness among the lower castes and the effect of their pleas for equality and privileges - all these factors led to Nair dominance

 The theory of balance of power assumes that a nation is more secure when the military capability is divided in such a way that no single state is so powerful that it alone suppresses other states
 shakti santulan kii avadharana lagbhag 15 veen shatabdi se antarrashtriya str main prachlit he
 Perhaps this is why some writers call it the basic principle of international politics, some call it the public principle or the fundamental principle of politics
 saadhaaran shabdon main shakti santulan kaa arth he jab ek rajya / rajyon kaa samooh duusare rajya / rajyon ke samooh ke saapeksh apni shakti itani badha le ki vah uske samakaksh ho jaae
 But there is no consensus on the definition of this notion
 shaayad isiilie innins el claude kaa kahana he ki yah aisi avadharana he jisaki paribhaasha kii samasya nahin he balki samasya yah he ki isaki bahut sari paribhaashaayen hai
 Before these definitions, it is also necessary to state that there are two types - simple and complex
 saral yaa saadhaaran shakti santulan jab hota he jab yah tulana do raashton yaa do raashton ke bich main sidhe taur par ho
 But if this equilibrium is between the mutual of two communities and also internally in the communities involved, then it is called complex balance
 iske sandarbh main vidwaanon ne vibhinn paribhaashaayen di hai jo is prakaar hai- Every nation aspires to gain more power than other nations to maintain or change the status quo
 iske parinamswaroop jis dhaanche kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vah shakti santulan kehalaata he
 The balance of power is some degree of stability or stability in equilibrium or international relations that can be achieved with the help of treaties or other means between states
 shakti santulan vah vyavastha he jiske antargat prayek rajya main yah vishwaas banaaye rakhane kaa satat praytn kiya jaataa he ki yadi rajya akraman kaa praytn karte hai to unhen ajey duusare rashtron ke samooh kaa pratirodh karnaa hoga
 The balance of power refers to a just system of power between members of the nation's families that prevents a nation from becoming so powerful that it does not impose its will on another nation
 is prakaar shakti santulan ko vidwaanon ne vibhinn dashshtiyon se dekha he
 Some see it as a distribution of power, some as an equilibrium between groups, some as stability, some as war and instability
 kehane kaa arth yah he ki in paribhaashaon main sarvasammati kaa abhaav he
 This is probably because there are many meanings / uses of balance of power, due to which this confusion has remained
 mukhya taur par shakti santulan ko chaar sandarbhon main prayog kiya jaataa he- According to Quincy Right, the principle of balance of power is based on five beliefs- shakti santulan kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai- In general it is a policy to maintain status quo, but in reality it is always dynamic and variable
 yah koi daivi vardaan nahin he, apitu yah maanav ke satat hastkshep kaa parinaam he
 It is defined both subjectively and objectively

 Although it is a mechanism for establishing peace, it rarely establishes peace

 Small nations only play the role of spectator
 iske sahi sanchaalan hetu ek sanchaalak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo aaj ke yug main nadaarad he
 It gives equal distribution of powers on the basis of equilibrium
 parantu yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki aisa samay kabhi nahin rahaa
 The system of balance of power is hardly visible in international politics, because it is not possible to measure and stabilize the element of power

 Similarly, Poland was divided into three times in such a way that the balance of power did not deteriorate

 Friendship treaties have also been a major means of balancing power
 lekin jab ek raashtra maitra sandhiyon ke dwaara apni shakti badha letaa he tab anya rajya bhi ashankit hokar aapas main prati maitra sandhiyaan karne lagate hai
 The end of this sequence is organized by all the nations of the world into opposing groups

 parantu doosraa raashtra yaa rajyon kaa samooh bhi peeche nahin rahanaa chahta, atah donon hi ek duusare ko santulit karnaa chaahate hai
 For example, in the Cold War era, between the former Soviet Union and the United States, armament has been a means of both of them balancing each other
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti shastreekaran ke saath-saath nirastrikaran bhi kai baar shaktiyon ke madhya santulan banane kaa kaary karata he

 Therefore, such a weak and neutral state always keeps the balance of power along with the possibility of war between the two big forces

 But it does get partial success through this, because - First, small states can assure their security

 Third, it is also capable of avoiding wars

 It often ignores cultural values, social influences, or the author's life in literary criticism
 iske bajaay yah granth kii bhashaa ke swaroop, vidha aadi par dhyaan detaa he
 Formalism in literature theory is called a critical method in which the features present in the language of the text are analyzed, analyzed, opened and evaluated
 is paddati main bhashaa kii vyakaran yaa utpatti sambandhi baton ke saath hi chand or alankaar jaisi saahitiyik prayuktiyon par vichaar karnaa bhi shaamil rahata he
 Formalist methodology underpins the importance of the need for literary, cultural or historical or life-related references of the author to critique literature
 kisi bhi kriti ke kathy ke mahatva ko bhi yah siddhant asweekaar karata he
 In fact, formalism emerged in the early twentieth century as a reaction to Romanticism

 This is particularly visible in the literature theories of René Vleck and Austin Warren

 Some of these new theories had political aims, while some contained the concept that it is hardly possible to separate literary works from their origin and use
 baad main rupvaad ko samaaj nirpeksh hone jaise nakaaratmak sandarbh main virodhiyon ke liye prayukt kiya jane laga
 The new trends in some academic literary criticism point to the possibility that formalism may be rebounded

 It is not appropriate to consider Indian customs or ornament communities as similar to the formalistic review movement

 Literature and art are subjects of style or composition only

 Nitrogen fixation is essential for vegetative and some other organisms because inorganic nitrogen is required for basic formation of organisms, and for biological synthesis
 Therefore, as part of the nitrogen cycle, it is necessary for agriculture and fertilizer manufacturing
 It is, indirectly, essential for the manufacture of all nitrogen-containing chemical compounds, including explosives, most medicines, and chemical dyes

 The addition of organic nitrogen occurs through the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia by an enzyme called nitrogenase
 In free-living diazotrophs, nitrogen-generated ammonium glutamine synthetase / glutamate synthesizes into glutamate via the synthase pathway

 Increasing the pressure over a gas or vapor at critical temperature at a particular pressure, which varies for each gas or vapor, is converted into a gas or vapor fluid
 is vishesh daab ko kranthik daab kehete hai
 This principle is used in extracting kerosene from oilseeds
 yahan kisi taap par gas yaa vaashp par utani hi daab di jaati he, jisase gas yaa vaashp kaa roopaantar drav main ho jaae
 High pressure is also used in the production of artificial diamonds from desalination, separation and graphite
 daab ke anek kaary hai
 It affects the chemical balance
 ucch daab par bahut si rasinic prakriyaaon kii gati bhi teevr ho jaati he
 Therefore, some substances are prepared in large quantities in a short time
 ucch daab se hi jal yaa anya duusare carbonic drav ucch taap par bhi drav rup main rahete hai
 This is not possible at normal pressure
 kuch rasinic prakriyaaon main isse vishesh laabhadaayak fal praapt hue hai
 Ammonia gas is formed from nitrogen and hydrogen gases according to the following chemical equation: l shottlye ke rasinic-santulan-siddhant ke anusaar jis prakriya main utpaadakon ko aaytan abhikaarakon ke aaytan se kam hota he usamen daab badhaane se utpaadakon kii utpatti main vruddhi ho jaati he
 It is clear from the equation above that two volumes of ammonia are formed when one volume of nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen are combined
 at: ucch daab par ammonia gas adhik maatra main banegi
 Since this process is exothermic, ammonia gas will be produced only at low temperatures
 inhen siddhanton ke aadhaar par haibar prakram dwaara ammonia vyapaarik maatra main banaai jaati he
 Like the speed of other processes at low temperature, the speed of this process also decreases
 at: vyapaarik maatra main banaai jaati he

 By keeping Premchand and Zainendra together, life and history can be understood with its totality
 jainendra kaa sabase bada yogadan hindi gadhy ke nirmaan main tha
 At the language level, the sabotage done by Zainendra did an unprecedented job of shaping Hindi
 jainendra kaa gadhy na hota to agyeya kaa gadhy sambhav na hota
 The Hindi story learned the first lesson of practicality from Janendra
 jainendra ne hindi ko ek paardarshee bhashaa or bhangima di, ek nayaa tevar diya, ek nayaa `sintex' diya
 Jainndra has an indelible mark on today's Hindi prose
 --rabindra kaaliya janendra ke praayah sabhi upanyaason main darshanik or aadhyatmik tatwon ke samavesh se duruhata ai he parantu ye saare tatv jahaan-jahaan bhi upanyaason main samavisht hue hai, vahaan ve paatro ke antar kaa srijan prathit hote hai
 This is why the characters of Jainndra seem unaffected by the external environment and circumstances and are driven by their introverted motions
 unki pratikriyaayein or vyavhaar bhi praayah inhen gatiyon ke anuroop hote hai
 As a result of this, there is a glut of characters in Jainendra's novels
 paatro kii alpsankhya ke kaaran bhi janendra ke upanyaason main vaiyaktik tatwon kii pradhanta rahi he
 Elements of revolutionism and militancy are also important bases of Jainendra's novels
 unke sabhi upanyaason main pramukh purush paatr shashakt kranti main aasthaa rakhte hai
 Despite having a kind of tenderness and sense of external nature, interest and behavior, they are great destroyers in their differences
 unka yah vidhwanskaari vyaktitv nari kii premavishyak asweekrutiyon kii pratikriya ke falswaroop nirmit hota he
 For this reason, when they find little shelter, sympathy or love of a woman, then they fall down and then their external nature becomes soft
 janendra ke nari paatr praayah upanyaas main pradhanta liye hue hote hai
 The novelist has introduced subtle psychological vision in the characterization of her female characters
 stri ke vividh roopon, uski kshamtaaon or pratikriyaaon kaa vishwasaneey ankan janendra kar sake hai
 In the novels 'sunita', 'resignation' and 'sukhada', there have been many occasions when her female character has gone through a state of severe mental conflict
 nari or purush kii apurnataa tathaa antarnirbharta kii bhaavana is sangharsh kaa mul aadhaar he
 She understands the man's attraction to him, poses for dedication and is captivated by this ability of complementary emotion, but sometimes when she sees this lack of attraction in the man, she is angry, distressed

 isi prakaar se jab purush se kathorta kii apeksha ke samay vinamrata paati he, tab yah bhi use asay ho jaataa he

 Tropical is the tropic of the world which is confined from the equator latitude 23 ° 26'16 "to the Tropic of Cancer in the north and latitude 23 ° 26'16" to the Tropic of Capricorn in the south
 yah akshansh prithvi ke aksheeya jhukaav se sambandhit he
 In the Cancer and Capricorn lines, the sun is directly above the head once in a solar year and twice in a solar year in the entire area between them
 vishwa kii aabaadi kaa ek bada bhaag is kshetra main rahata he or aisa anumaanit he ki badhati jansankhya ke kaaran yah aabaadi or badhati hi jaayegi
 It is the hottest region of the Earth because the Sun's maximum heat is centered on the equator and its surrounding area due to the Earth's axial tilt
 haalanki aam janamat yah he ki ooshnakaribandh ek garm ilaaka jahaan hameshaa varsha hoti rahati he or hariyaali rahati he lekin vaastaviktaa aisi nahin he
 There are many areas where dry and moist weather is found here

 It is also given the name of the green season to promote tourism
 nam ilaake puure ooshna or up-ooshna katibandh main faile hue hai
 The moist month is one in which 60 mm

 ooshnakaribandheey wanon main kushk or nam mausam nahin paaya jaataa he kyonki yahan puure saal bhar samaan rup se varsha hoti he
 The rainy season usually starts at the end of the hot season
 kuch ilaakon main to itani barish ho jaati he ki baadh aa jaati he jisase mitti kaa kataav hota he or mitti kii urvartaa bhi ghatati he
 It is a season of abundance for most of the animals in the region and their reproduction period is related to it
 vishwa kii sabase ghaatak bimaariyaan bhi is kshetra main bharpoor hoti hai
 Because the environment here is also conducive for mosquitoes to thrive, so mosquito-related diseases are also very high here

 Although the use of arc in Vastushastra is more than two thousand years old, but its methodical use seems to have been started by the ancient Romans

 The birth of psychoanalysis, Dr
 Sigmund Freud, termed the son's sexuality to his mother as the Oedipus gland
 frid ke anusaar idipas kii yah katha har manushya ke antar main chhipi hui kamvasana kii ek granthi kaa sankethik pratinidhaan karti he
 The goal of man's first sexual desire is the mother and the first target of violence and hatred is the father
 isi kamvasana kii bhavagranthi ko inhone idipas granthi ke naam se sambodhit kiya
 Talking about its effects on human life, he said that this gland is working in the background of our moral, religious and social rules and restrictions
 paap or aparaadh kii bhaavana kaa janm isi se hua
 Feelings of self-infliction, suicide or self-punishment are generated due to this
 inke anusaar manushya ke vikaas kii jad main yah granthi hi he kyonki vikaas ke prarambh main manushyon ne sarvapratham apane upar keval do pratibandh lagaae
 First, not to kill your father or father and second, not to marry your mother or mother
 yahi do pratham naitik or dharmik niyam hai
 He also considered the Oedipus Psychology to be the root cause of any kind of mental deformity and mainly psychopathology
 inkaa kathan tha ki yah granthi saamaanya or asaamaanya donon hi prakaar ke vyaktiyon main pai jaati he, antar keval itnaa he ki ek ne usapar vijay praapt kar lee he or isliye vah saamaanya he jabaki doosraa uskaa das he or isliye vah asaamaanya he
 The root cause of the differences and conflicts of different groups, castes and societies is also the difference of the suffixes established towards their parents, it was their idea
 ek hi vastu ke prati prem or ghrinaa ke vipareet bhaavon ke vidyaman hone kaa kaaran bhi inhone 'idipas granthi' ko hi mana
 Our emotional life was fundamentally unfamiliar with the inclusion of such contrary sentiments towards the same object
 sarvapratham aise bhaavon kii utpatti sambhavat: mata pita ke prati hamaare samvegatmak sambandhon se hi hoti he kyonki inkaa prabalatam rup mata pita ke prati bhaavon main hi paaya jaataa he
 The feelings of love towards mother and hatred towards father are sometimes called positive Oedipus gland and love towards father and hatred towards mother is called negative Oedipus gland
 is granthi kaa ek swaroop putree kaa pita ke prati kamvasana kii bhaavana bhi paaya jaataa he jise electra granthi kaha jaataa he
 In opposition to Freud's assertion that the Oedipus gland is universal, its basis is inborn and it is found in every human being in the same form, neo-freudian and other modern theories stated that its basis is considered culture, that is its form It is determined by different people
 fenichal ke anusaar vyakti ke apane paariwarik anubhav hi uski is granthi kii utpatti or uske vaastavik swaroop kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 Adler did not consider this gland to be original or inborn, but he said that it is an unnatural result of the mother's more pampered love
 jung ke anusaar yah granthi manushya kii punarjanm kii moulik ichha kaa sankethik pratinidhaan karti he arthath manushya kii moulik ichha apane janmasthan main laut jane kii hoti he
 While admitting this imaginary flight of Jung, Rank also said that the essence of this gland is in the child's entire relationship to his parents
 paariwarik sambandhon kii mahatta ko sweekaar karte hue harney ne ise do sthitiyon par aadhaarit bataaya
 The first situation is the provocative lusts of the parents and the second is the anxiety arising out of the need to be dependent on others and the mental duality of violent feelings towards the parents
 frome ne pitaputra ke bich is sangharsh kaa aadhaar kamvasana na maanakar pitrupradhan samaajon kii adhikaar praapt karne kii bhaavana mana he
 Other scholars like Sullivan, Tamson etc
 have also considered mutual relations within the family as the basis of this gland
 rakt oxikshinta rudhir kaa ek gun yah he ki vah oxigen ko avashoshit kar, vividh angon or utakon tak pahunchaata he, jahaan uskaa upyog hota he
 Thus small amounts of oxygen remain in the blood of organisms
 kinhin sthitiyon main rakt oxigen kaa ausat pariman paryaapt kam ho ja saktaa he, is avasthaa ko rudhir oxikshinta 
 At this stage, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood becomes degraded
 jab oxigen kaa aanshik dabaav avanamit ho jaataa he tab dhamneey rudhir main oxigen kii santrupti bhi nimna pad jaati he
 This condition occurs whenever proper oxygenation of the blood is blocked in the lungs due to any reason
 adholikhit paristhitiyaan ise utpann karti hai: Reduced oxygen pressure in breathable air, fefdon ke rog jinase gasiy vinimay niruddh ho jaataa he or Congenital heart disease due to clear oval foramen
 jab manushya upar kii ore udata he tab oxigen kaa dabaav kramash: kam hota jaataa he or oonchaai kii aisi sthiti aa sakati he jab vah samuchit maatra main oxigen na praapt kar sake
 Therefore, oxygen vessels are taken together to supply additional oxygen
 kuch rogon se grast manushya, phupfus utakon kii kami ke kaaran, nishwasit oxigen ko avashoshit nahin kar paata, jisase oxigen ke saamaanya pariman se rudhir santrupt nahin hota
 The respiratory rate increases to compensate for this damage
 janmajaat hridrog - isamen baayein hriday kaa rudhir daayen hriday ke rudhir se mishrit ho jaataa he or is prakaar oxijnikrut or anoksijnikrut rudhir mishrit ho jaataa he, jisase fefdon main uchit parisancharan tathaa santrupti nahin ho paati or yah dasha utpann hoti he
 Now we will consider the chemical chemistry of the body blood of organisms suffering from this disease
 prastut nidarsh chitra tathyon ko spasht karne ke liye he
 The picture shows the oxygen saturation, normal state, and blood oxidation status of arterial blood and head blood
 prayek stambh kaa kaala bhaag rakt main apachayit haemoglobin kaa pratishat or shwet bhaag oxihaemogmoglobin ko nirupit karata he
 In normal condition, the initial oxygen capacitance of a person's blood was the same
 tiron se oxigen upyogikaran ke gunank, arthath utakon dwaara ek ikai rakt se hataae hue oxigen ke aaytan darshaae gaye hai
 We assume that humans breathe oxygen in a depressed pressure atmosphere
 saamaanya astha main rakt oxikshinta kii disha main fefdon se nikalanevaale rudhir main mana ja saktaa he kis 100 millilitre main 15 millilitre oxigen he
 5 percent of the tissue is used, and therefore 10 cubic centimeters of oxygen per hundred cubic centimeters of blood is left
 dhamneey or shiraagat asantruptiyaan kramash: 5 or 10 ghan centimetre he or keshika asantrupti inaki madhya hogi, arthath 7
5 pratishat aaytan yah shyaamata utpann karegi
 Thus, blackness is a symptom of blood oxidation
 shyaamata utpann karne ke liye 100 millilitre keshika rudhir main nunatam 5 gram apachayit haemoglobin hona chahie
 In the case of blackness, the skin color changes to blue
 yah parivatran hont, kaan, haath, pair or nakhun se spasht ho jaataa he
 The depletion of the oxygen pressure of the blood increases lymphatic flow from almost all organs, such as the heart, lungs, or leg
 is sthiti main kuch anya baaten bhi spasht ho jaati hai
 The heart rate of the patient increases, he becomes sad and breathless and he also has mental disturbances in the form of euphoria, nostalgia, mania and stagnant thoughts
 jab bhi rudhir main oxigen kii kami ho jaati he, utakon ko oxigen kii prapti kam hone lagati he
 In this situation, tissue damage occurs
 kendriya tantrikatantr or vahikaatantr ke utak is prakaar kii kshati ke liye sarvaadhik grahanshil hote hai
 Whenever the capillaries of the capillaries are damaged, the liquid leaks out of them and the liquid is lost from circulation
 rakt oxikshinta main sharir par prabhaavon kii tivrata rakt oxikshinta ke akraman kii aakasmikta, usee maatra, avadhi tathaa sharir kii saamaanya sharirkriyaatmak sthiti se prabhavit hoti he
 If blood oxidation does not take a very violent form, or does not persist for long, cardiac output is greatly increased
 yadi sthiti adhik samay tak bani rahati he yaa ugr ho jaati he, to hritpeshistar par hanikaarak prabhaav ke kaaran hrideey utpaadan kramash: ghatata jaataa he
 Since this condition occurs due to lack of oxygen, oxygen therapy is used
 oxijanprayog karne ke purv yah jaan lenaa bahut aavashyak he ki rogi oxigen prayog ke upyukt he yaa nahin
 It depends on some facts
 yadi andakaar radhran yaa fefde main purnat: awatin bhaag upasthit he, to oxigen ant: shwasan se rogi ko abhisht laabh nahin hota
 Due to the presence of oval blood, the blood that replenishes the healthy and ventilated follicle will not absorb significant amounts of extra oxygen to compensate for the lateral blood
 broncho yaa pindakeey phupfusarthi main fefde kaa bhaag kaam nahin karata or falat: raktaoxikshinta ho jaati he
 Oxygen use proves to be very successful in emphysema, pleurisy and gas poisoning
 oxigen kii kami ke kaaran phupfus upakalaa kii praveshyata taral ke prati bad jaati he or pariman swaroop shoth ho jaataa he
 Therefore, inflammation induces blood oxidation and blood oxidation promotes inflammation

 Oxygen use is relieved in blood oxidation caused by rapid and shallow respiration, as this increases the oxygen tension of the partially treated alveoli

 Jalal Uddin Mohammad Akbar was the third ruler of the Mughal dynasty of the Timurid lineage
 akbar ko akbar-i-aazam, shahenshaah akbar, mahabali shahenshaah ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Emperor Akbar was the grandson of Zaheeruddin Muhammad Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, and the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and Hamida Bano
 babar kaa vansh taimur or mongol netaa changez khan se sambandhit tha arthath uske vanshaj taimur langs ke khandaan se the or matrupaksh kaa sambandh changez khan se tha
 By the end of Akbar's rule in 1605, the Mughal Empire consisted mostly of northern and central India and was one of the most powerful empires of the time
 baadshahon main akbar hi ek aisa badshaah tha, jise hindu muslim donon virgon kaa baraabar pyaar or sammaan mila
 He established a religion called din-i-ilahi to reduce the distance between hindu-muslim sects
 uskaa darbar sabake liye har samay khulaa rahata tha
 In his court, there were more Hindu chieftains than Muslim chieftains
 akbar ne hinduon par lagane vaala jazia hi nahin samaapt kiya, balki aise anek kaary kiye jinke kaaran hindu or muslim donon uske prashansak bane
 Akbar was sitting on the throne of Delhi after the death of his father Naseeruddin Muhammad Humayun at the age of just thirteen
 apane shashan kaal main usne shaktishaalee pashtun vanshaj shershah suri ke akraman bilkul band karvaa diye the, saath hi panipat ke dwitiya yuddh main navghoshit hindu raja hemu ko parajeet kiya tha
 It took Akbar two decades to form his empire and bring all the regions of northern and central India into unilateral authority
 uskaa prabhaav lagbhag puure bhartiya upmahadweep par tha or is kshetra ke ek bade bhubhag par samraat ke rup main usne shashan kiya
 As emperor, Akbar made diplomatic relations with powerful and majority Hindu Rajput kings and also married them
 akbar ke shashan kaa prabhaav desh kii kala evam samskruti par bhi padaa
 He showed a lot of interest in fine arts like painting etc
 and the walls of his palace were filled with beautiful paintings and samples
 mughal chitrakaari kaa vikaas karne ke saath saath hi usne europea style kaa bhi swaagat kiya
 He was also interested in literature and had got many Sanskrit manuscripts and texts translated into Persian and Persian texts into Sanskrit and Hindi
 anek farsi samskruti se jude chitron ko apane darbar kii deevaaron par bhi banwaaya
 During his early rule, Akbar did not have tolerance towards Hindus, but over time he changed himself and showed great interest in other religions including Hindus
 usne hindu rajput rajkumariyon se vaivaahik sambandh bhi banaaye
 There were many Hindu courtiers, military officers and feudatories in Akbar's court
 usne dharmik charchaaon va vaad-vivaad kaaryakramon kii anokhi shrunkhlaa aarambh kii thi, jisamen muslim aalim logon kii jain, sikh, hindu, charvak, naastik, yahudee, portugali evam catholic isai dharmashastriyon se charchaaen hua karti thim
 He had respect for these religious leaders, which did not affect his personal religious feelings at all
 usne aage chalakar ek naye dharm deen-e-ilaahi kii bhi sthapana kii, jisamen vishwa ke sabhi pradhan dharmon kii nitiyon va shikshaaon kaa samavesh tha
 Unfortunately, this religion ended with the death of Akbar
 itane bade samraat kii mrityu hone par uski antyeshti bina kisi sanskaar ke jaldi hi kar di gayi
 Traditionally, a passage was made by breaking the wall in the fort and his body was quietly buried in the tomb of Sikandra
 akbar kaa janm poornima ke din hua tha isliye unka naam badaruddin mohammad akbar rakhaa gaya tha
 Badr means Full Moon and Akbar was derived from his maternal grandfather Sheikh Ali Akbar Jami
 kaha jaataa he ki kabul par vijay milane ke baad unke pita humayun ne buree nazar se bachane ke liye akbar kii janm tithi evam naam badal die the
 It is also legend that the people of India honored him with the name Akbar for his successful and efficient governance
 arabi bhashaa me akbar shabd kaa arth "mahaan" yaa bada hota he
 Akbar was born on November 23, 1542 in Umerkot, Sindh, the palace of the Rajput ruler Rana Amarsal
 yahaan badshaah humayu apni haal kii vivaahita begum hamida bano begum ke saath sharan liye hue the
 Humayun named this son once in a dream, according to which he was named Jalaluddin Mohammad
 babar kaa vansh taimur or mongol netaa changez khan se tha yani uske vanshaj taimur langs ke khandaan se the or matrupaksh kaa sambandh changez khan se tha
 Thus Akbar's arteries were a mixture of the blood of two of Asia's most famous races, the Turks and the Mongols
 humayun ko pashtun netaa shershah suri ke kaaran faras main agyatavaas bitaana pad rahaa tha
 But he did not take Akbar with him, but left him in Mukundpur, a village in the kingdom of Rewa
 akbar kii vahaan ke rajkumaar ram singh pratham se, jo aage chalakar rivaan kaa raja bana, ke sang gahari mitrataa ho gayi thi
 They grew up together and grew and remained lifelong friends
 kalantar main akbar safaavi samrajya main apane ek chachaa mirza askari ke yahaan rahane laga
 He first stayed in Kandahar for a few days and then in Kabul from 1545
 humayun kii apane chote bhaaiyon se baraabar thani hi rahi isaliye chachaa logon ke yahan akbar kii sthiti bandi se kuch hi acchhee thi
 However, all were well with him and probably loved affectionately too much
 kintu akbar pard likh nahin sakaa vah keval sainya shiksha le sakaa
 He spent a lot of time in hunting, running and dueling, wrestling etc
, and he was not interested in education
 jab tak akbar aath varsh kaa hua, janm se lekar ab tak uske sabhi varsh baari asthirataa main nikle the jiske kaaran uski shiksha-diksha kaa sahi prabandh nahin ho paaya tha
 Now Humayun's attention also went towards this
 lagbhag navambar, +--9-9 main usne akbar kii shiksha prarambh karne ke liye kabul main ek aayojan kiya
 But on the occasion, Akbar lost the ceremony on the second day
 mullah jaada mullah asamuddin abrahim ko akbar kaa shikshak niyukt kiya gaya
 But Mulla Asmuddin proved incompetent
 tab yah kaary pehle moulana bamjid ko saunpa gaya, magar jab unhen bhi safalataa nahin mili to moulana abdul kaadir ko yah kaam saunpa gaya
 But none of the teachers succeeded in educating Akbar
 asal main, padhane-likhane main akbar kii ruchi nahin thi, uski ruchi kabutar baaji, ghudsawaari or kute paalane main adhik thi
 But he was always interested in learning
 kaha jaataa he, ki jab vah sone jaataa tha, ek vyakti use kuch pard kar sunaata rahta tha
 Over time, Akbar emerged as a mature and discerning ruler with a keen interest in art, architecture, music and literature
 shershah suri ke putr islam shah ke uttaradhikaar ke vivaadon se utpann araajaktaa kaa laabh uthaa kar humayun ne 1555 main dilli par punah adhikaar kar liya
 In this, a good part of his army was the Persian ally Tahmasp I
 iske kuch maah baad hi 48 varsh kii aayu main hi humayun kaa aakasmik nidhan apane pustkaalay kii seedhi se baari nashe kii halaat main girane ke kaaran ho gaya
 Then Akbar's mentor Bairam Khan kept this death hidden for some time in the interest of the empire and prepared Akbar for succession
 14 farvari, 1556 ko akbar kaa rajtilak hua
 All this happened during the ongoing war with Sikander Shah Suri for the return of authority on the throne of Delhi from the Mughal Empire
 13 varshiya akbar kaa kalnaur, punjab main sunahare vastra tathaa ek gahare rang kii pagadi main ek navnirmit manch par rajtilak hua
 This platform remains even today
 use farsi bhashaa main samraat ke liye shabd shahenshaah se pukaara gaya
 Until adulthood, his kingdom remained under the protection of Bairam Khan
 khoye hue rajya ko punah praapt karne ke liye akbar ke pita humayun ke anwarat praytn antat safal hue or vah san 1555 main hindustan pahunch sakaa kintu agle hi varsh san 1556 main rajdhani dilli main uski mrityu ho gai or gurdaspur ke kalnaur naamak sthaan par 14 varsh kii aayu main akbar kaa rajtilak hua
 Bairam Khan, the patron of Akbar, was appointed whose influence remained on him till 1560
 tatkaaleen mughal rajya keval kabul se dilli tak hi failaa hua tha
 Along with this, many problems were also raised
 1563 main shamsuddin atka khan kii hatya par ubhara jan aakrosh, 1564-65 ke bich uzbek vidroh or 1566-67 main mirza bhaaiyon kaa vidroh bhi tha, kintu akbar ne badi kushalta se in samasyaon ko hal kar liya
 He increased his feudal power through his creativity
 isi bich 1566 main maham anka naamak uski dhai ke banawaaye madrase se shahar lautate hue akbar par tir se ek jaanaleva hamalaa hua, jise akbar ne apni furti se bachaa liya, haalanki uski baanh main gaharaa ghaav hua
 After this incident there was some change in Akbar's Prashan style under which he took full reins of governance
 iske fouran baad hi hemu ke netritv main afgaan sena punah sangathit hokar uske sammukh chunauti banakar khadi thi
 In the early period of his rule, Akbar understood that he would not be able to rule peacefully without ending the Suri dynasty
 isliye vah suri vansh ke sabase shaktishaalee shaasha sikandar shah suri par akraman karne punjab chal padaa
 He handed over the rule of Delhi to Mughal commander Tardi Bag Khan
 sikandar shah suri akbar ke liye bahut bada pratirodh sabit nahi hua
 In some regions, his army used to retreat even before Akbar arrived
 akbar kii anupasthiti me hemu vikramaditya ne dilli or agra par akraman kar vijay praapt kii
 On 6 October 1556 Hemu declared himself the Maharaja of India
 isi ke saath dilli me hindu rajya kii punah sthapana hui
 When Akbar got the news of Delhi's defeat, he immediately made an intention to travel to Delhi after consulting Bairam Khan
 akbar ke salaahkaaro ne use kabul kii sharan main jane kii salaah di
 There was a war in Panipat between Akbar and Hemu's army
 yah yuddh panipat kaa dwitiya yuddh ke naam se prasiddh he
 Despite being small in number, Akbar won in this war
 is vijay se akbar ko 1500 hathi mili jo manakot ke hamale main sikandar shah suri ke viruddh kaam aae
 Sikandar Shah Suri surrendered and Akbar surrendered him
 dilli par punah adhikaar jamaane ke baad akbar ne apane rajya kaa vistaar karnaa shuru kiya or malwa ko 1562 main, gujarat ko 1572 main, bengal ko 1574 main, kabul ko 1581 main, kashmir ko 1586 main or khandesh ko 1601 main mogul samrajya ke adheen kar liya
 Akbar appointed one governor in each of these states
 akbar yah nahi chahta tha kii mogul samrajya kaa kendra dilli jaise duurastha shahar main ho; isliye usne yah nirnay liya kii mogul rajdhani ko fatehpur sikri le jaaya jaae jo samrajya ke madhya main thi
 Shortly after, Akbar had to be removed from the capital Fatehpur Sikri
 kaha jaataa he ki pani kii kami iskaa pramukh kaaran tha
 After Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar built a mobile court that used to roam across the empire, thus it was possible to pay proper attention to all the corners of the empire
 san 1585 main uttar pashchimi rajya ke sucharu raaj paalan ke liye akbar ne lahore ko rajdhani banaaya
 Before his death, Akbar made Agra the capital back in 1599 and ruled from there till the end
 san 1560 main akbar ne swayan satta sambhaal lee or apane sangrakshak bairam khan ko nikaal baahar kiya
 Now Akbar had power in his hands but there were many difficulties as well
 jaise - shamsuddin atka khan kii hatya par ubhara jan aakrosh, uzbek vidroh or mirza bhaaiyon kaa vidroh kintu akbar ne badi kushalta se in samasyaon ko hal kar liya
 He increased his feudal power through his creativity
 san 1562 main amer ke shaasha se usne samjhauta kiya - is prakaar rajput raja bhi uski ore ho gayi
 Similarly, he also gave big help to those coming from Iran
 bhartiya musalamaanon ko bhi usne apane kushal vyavhaar se apni ore kar liya
 He gave a unique introduction to religious tolerance - the Jiziya was removed by putting Hindu places of pilgrimage
 isse puure rajyavasiyon ko anubhav ho gaya ki vah ek parivartit niti apnaane main sakasham he
 In addition, he also forcibly stopped the conversion of prisoners of war
 akbar ne apane shasankaal main taanben, chaandi evam sone kii mudraayen prachlit kii
 There was beautiful Islamic printing on the back of these postures
 akbar ne apane kaal kii mudraao main kai badlaav kiye
 He introduced an open mint system in which if any person was able to pay the mint fee, he could change the currency of Akbar from another currency or gold
 akbar chahta tha ki uske puure samrajya main samaan mudra chale
 After the Second War of Panipat, Akbar regained Delhi by killing Hemu
 iske baad usne apane rajya kaa vistaar karnaa shuru kiya or malwa ko 1562 main, gujarat ko 1572 main, bengal ko 1574 main, kabul ko 1581 main, kashmir ko 1586 main or khandesh ko 1601 main mogul samrajya ke adheen kar liya
 Akbar appointed one governor each to handle the administration in these states
 use raaj sanbhaalane ke liye dilli kai sthanon se dur laga or ye prathit hua ki isse prashasan main samasya aa sakati he, atah usne nirnay liya kii mogul rajdhani ko agra ke nikat fatehpur sikri le jaaya jaae jo samrajya ke lagbhag madhya main thi
 Akbar built a new city on an old settled village Sikri which was named Fatehabad or Fatehpur in the joy of his victory i
e
 Fatah
 jaldi hi ise puure vartmaan naam fatehpur sikri se bulaayaa jane laga
 Most of the constructions here are of the 14 years in which Akbar resided here
 shahar main shahi udyaan, aaraamgahen, saamanton va darbariyon ke liye awaas tathaa bacchon ke liye madrase banawaaye gaye
 According to Blair and Bloom there are two major types of buildings within the city - service buildings, such as caravanseri, mint, factories, big markets where vertical constructions of the southwest / north east axis are built and the second royal part, which is India's largest There are collective mosques, as well as residential and administrative buildings called Daulatkhana
 ye pahari se kuch kone par sthit hai tathaa kibala ke saath ek kone banaati hai
 But this decision was not proved right and after some time Akbar had to be removed from the capital Fatehpur Sikri
 iske peeche pani kii kami pramukh kaaran tha
 After Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar created a mobile court that roamed throughout the empire and thus made it possible to pay proper attention to all the places of the empire
 baad main usne san 1585 main uttar pashchimi bhaag ke liye lahore ko rajdhani banaaya
