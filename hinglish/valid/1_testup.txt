 Later, Shae tries to conceive while pregnant through a medical scan
 lekin is anjaane dar ke khyaal se, vah swachlit surgery teble kii madad se apane udar main pal rahe skiwad-numa jeev baahar karti he
 Sha then encounters Wayland, who had arrived in prominence with them, riding in Prometheus
 unke mutabik vah mahaj un ejiniyaron se budhaape se maut rokane kii madad chaahate hai? veyaland ke us dhaanche main jane se pehle, wickers unako "pita" kahkar sambodhit karti he
 On the other hand, the nearly deformed Fayfield's corpse survives, causing havoc in the Prometheus airport, and leads to the death of several crew members

 He is convinced that his building structure is actually a spacecraft
 veyaland or unki team dubaara us dhaanche main, sha ke saath lautati he
 David wakes up the sleeping engineer and tries to talk so that they can explain Weyland's demand
 lekin vah ejeeniyar jawaab dene ke badale david kaa sir dhad se alag karata he or veyaland evam uski team ko maar kar, us puure antarikshayan ko punarskriy karata he
 Sha escapes and warns Janek on the radio that now that the engineer's intent is to transport that dangerous liquid to Earth, she orders the spacecraft to stop
 jenek tab wickers ke liye lifebot ijact kar, apane jahaaj promethius ko us pargrahi ke yon par joardaar takkar martha he, is bich wickers pad kii madad se batch nikalati he
 The engineer's vehicle that failed to fly collapses and falls to the ground; And Vickers runs into the rubble to save his life
 sha us likebaat main jaati he, jahaan wo pargrahi skiwad abbhi jinda tha or kaaphi daanav rup main bad chukaa tha
 On the other hand, David's head still actively warns Sha to escape that engineer
 ejeeniyar jabaran us lifebot ke airlaak ko kholkar ghusata he or sha par hamalaa karata he, lekin jald hi vah uske chhudaae pargrahi kii giraft main aa jaataa he, or uske gale main apane shishan jaisaa tantu ghusedakar use nidhaal kar detaa he
 Sha finds David's remains again, and with his help, launches another engineer's vehicle

 That is, rectifiers, a

 dishtakaari bahut upyogi he kyonki aajkal ke bahut se upkaran disi se hi chalate hai jabaki baahar se unhen e-si hi di jaati he
 Solid state diodes, vacuum-tube diodes, mercury-arc-valves, selenium diodes and scrs for decimation
 Etc
 are used
 ardhchaalak diod ke aane ke pehle nirvaat-nalika diod yaa copper-oxide yaa selenie-stack dishtakaari prayog main aate the
 The device working opposite to the work of rectifier is called inverter
 praayah sabhi dishtakaari ek yaa adhik diodon ko vishesh kram main jodkar banaaye jate hai
 DC is usually more pure by using more diodes i
e
 is tarah ke dishtakaari main e-si kaa aadha bhaag hi lod main bheja jaataa he jabaki baaki aadha hissaa lod main jane se roak diya jaataa he
 It is used only for very low power output, not for much power
 kyonki yah bahut kam dakshata se vidyut-shakti kaa hastaantaran karata he
 Half-wave rectifiers in a phase circuit can be made using only one diode
 
 It takes three diodes for a three-phase supply
 voltage regulation = acha Average voltage = v max / pie ausat dhara = ai maiks / pai RMS voltage or effective voltage = v max / 2 aaremes dhara yaa prabhavi dhara = ai maximum / 2 Efficiency = 40
 6% ripal factor yaa urmika gunank = 1
2 1% Form factor or shape coefficient or metaphor * = 1
57 Peak factor = 2 TUF = 0
286 PIV = Vmax Output frequency = f_in is tarah kaa dishtakaari input asi ke dono bhaagon ko lod main bhejtaa he or lod main ek hi disha main dhara sunishchit karata he
 It is clear that it is more efficient than half-wave rectifier
 ek-phej paripathon main do tarah ke purna-tarang dishtakaari prayog kiye jate hai: Center-tap rectifier requires only two diodes, but this requires a center-tap transformer
 During the positive cycle of center tap / midpoint rectifier-supply, diode D1 becomes forward bias and behaves like a closed key
 This diode D2 sleeps reverse bye and behaves like an open key, diode D2 forward bias sleeps off key during the negative cycle of the supply In the meantime, diode D1 becomes reverse bias and behaves like an open key
 Average voltage = 2vmax / fhai average current = two imax / jab adhik shakti kaa disi kii aavashyak hoti he to ek-feji vidyut shakti ke bajaay teen-feji asi ko ractifi karnaa adhik upyukt rahata he
 It takes 6-diodes

 rujukari, input asi ko bahut adhik aavriti par band-chaalu karke disi banaate hai
 This causes the ripple frequency in the output DC to be very high and the current taken from the input AC is also almost sine-shaped
 aajkal adhik aavriti par band-chaalu kiye ja sakane vaale mossphate or aijibiti aadi swichon kii sulabhta ke kaaran is prakaar ke rujukari upyog main aane lage hai
 The output of the ripple in which the frequency of ripple is high, the value of l and c required to filter it will be less
 isi liye adhik shakti kii disi banane ke liye 12-pulse, 24-pulse yaa 48-pulse ke rujukari upyog main laaye jate hai
 The charger is a very useful power converter

 keetpremi phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se dusre ko paraag sthanantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai

 Flowers also attract pollinators with fragrance and color
 phir bhi kuch phool paragakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye nakal yaa anukaran karte hai
 For example, some orchid species create flowers that match the color, shape and scent of the female bee

 Vataparagit flowers use air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, Ambergia rag hay and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators because of which they do not tend to be "showy flowers"
 Male and female reproductive organs are usually found in separate flowers, male flowers have long stamens fibers that are open at the end, and female fruits have long, wing-like pistils
 jahaan ki kitprageeya phulon ke paraag bade or lasalase daanon ki pravriti liye hue rahete hai jo ki protein main dhani hote hai, vaataparagit phulon ke paraag zyaadaatar chote dane liye hue rahete hai, bahut halke or kiton ke liye itane poshak bhi nahi

 Yet in some plant breeds, the flowers are incomplete or unisexual: holding only stamens or pistil organs
 In the first case if a particular plant which is either female or male is considered a diocesius 
 lekin agar ek lingeey purush yaa maadaa phool ek hi paudhe par dikhte hai to aise nasl ko monoisius kaha jaataa he
 Additional discussion on the change of flowers from the original plan is mentioned in the articles containing the original parts of the flowers

 paudhe dwaara paraagan kii vyavastha is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kis tarah se paraagan ko istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Most flowers can be broadly divided into two groups depending on their mode of pollination
 kitparageeya: phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se dusre ko paraag sthantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai
 Mostly they specialize in shapes / forms and the stamens have such an arrangement that it is ensured that the pollen grains are transferred to the pollination when it lands on its attractor
 To get it, the pollinator transfers the pollen to the stigma in all the flowers that are arranged in exactly the same way 
 kai phool paraagan ke liye maatr phulon ke hisson ke bich nikatataa par nirbhar / bharosa karte hai
