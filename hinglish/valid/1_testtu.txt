 Chromatography comes from the Greek word chroma which means 'color' and graphene is the collective term for a set of laboratory techniques for partitioning a mixture of "to write")
 mishran ek taral padaarth mobile charan kaha jaataa he, jo ise ek sanrachana sthir charan naamak ek or maal ke madhyam se kiya jaataa he main bhang kar rahaa he
 Different components of the mixture travel in different speeds, causing them to separate
 judaai mobile or sthir charnon ke bich antar vibhaajan par aadhaarit he
 There is a subtle difference in the partition coefficient result of a compound in maintaining the difference over the stationary phase and thus changing the separation

 He said, for example, the development of concentric rings by leaving solutions of inorganic compounds on the center of a piece of filter paper; a treatise was published in 1861 by Friedrich Goppelsröder describing the method and giving it the name "capillary analysis
" " The discovery of chromatography, however, is generally attributed to Russian botanist Mikhail S
 Tsvet, as he recognized the physical basis of separation in 1901 and applied it in a rational and organized way to the separation of plant pigments, particularly Carotinoids and Chlorophyll
 Tsvet ek takanic he ki anivaary rup se ek hi rup main aaj prayog kiya jaataa he kaa varnan kiya
 He added a stacked glass column pack with an adsorbent material such as alumina, silica, or powdered sugar, added a solution of plant pigments to the top of the column, and the medium of the column with an organic solvent Washed off the pigments
 pigment stambh par asatat rang kaa band, kshetron pigment kii puri tarah se mukt dwaara vibhajit kii ek shrinkhalaa main alag kar diya
 Because tsvet worked with colored material, he called the method chromatography

 Chromatography emerged from its relative darkness in 1931 when German chemist Richard Kuhn and his student, French chemist Edgar Lederer, reported the use of this method in the resolution of a number of biologically important materials
 1941 main do british dawa kii dukaanon main, archer je pi martin or richard L
M
 Synge, oon ke amino acid sanrachana ke ek adhyayan shuru kiya
 His initial efforts, in which he used to use a technique called liquid-liquid countercurrent distribution, failed to give him sufficient separation; They envisioned, therefore, an alternative method, in which a liquid was firmly bound to pack a thin granular solid into a glass tube and another liquid, previously immiscible, percolated through it

 The technique came to be called split chromatography
 us samay, martin or Synge suzav diya he ki chalati charan main acchhee tarah se ek gas ho sakati he
 It is a historical oddity that this idea was ignored for nearly a decade, possibly because of the war, in collaboration with British chemist Anthony T
 James who began studying gas-liquid chromatography division until Martin
 1952 main martin or Synge nobel puraskaar unke kaam ke liye, shaayad itnaa nahin takanic kaa nayaapan ke liye, lekin ek model he ki anya pranaaliyon, ek ganitiya siddhant, or doorgaami saath acid or peptid vibhaajan amino ek prayojyata suzav ke liye sammanit kiya gaya jaev rasinic padhai par prabhaav padataa he
 The initial partition-chromatography system presented difficulties due to the lack of reproducibility in silica gel and lack of uniformity in packing of columns

 Principles of chromatography: Differential similarities of different components of analogues towards stationary and mobile phase results in differential separation of components: the principle of separation of different components
 'sokhna' or 'ghulanshiltaa': atmiyata, baari main, anu kii do sampattiyon se nirdhaarit hota he
 We can define how a component of the well mixture adsorption as the property of sticks for the stationary phase, while solubility is the property of how a component of the well mix dissolves in the mobile phase
 ucchtar sthir charan ko sokhna, dhimi anu kollam ke madhyam se kadam hoga
 The higher the solubility in the mobile phase, the faster the molecule will move through the column
 to, upar do karkon ke bich paraspar kriya antar daron jis par analai ke vibhinn ghatakon ke kollam ke madhyam se kadam hoga nirdhaarit karata he
 The adsorption and solubility of a molecule can be manipulated by choosing the appropriate stationary phase and mobile phase

 The liquid mobile phase and particles are called the stationary phase
 anuon he ki alag kiya jayega kaa ek mishran mobile charan main shuru kii he
 The blue molecules will be separated from the red molecules in the animation below and a mixture containing these two types of molecules is introduced in the mobile phase in front of the stationary phase
 laal or nile rang ke anuon kaa mishran to sthir charan ke madhyam se mobile charan se le jaaya jaataa he
 The mixture is that, for most of the red molecules stationary phase, the adsorption slows through the molecule, the particle bed in this particular case
 laal anuon nile rang se alag ho jate hai
 Different types of chromatography is lekh main ham, ham kya saamaanya charan chrometography ke rup main dekhen ke saath kaam kar rahe hai jiskaa arth he ki hamaare sthir charan prakruti main dhruviya he or hamaare mobile charan prakruti main gaiyr dhruviya he
 For special applications, scientists sometimes employ reverse phase chromatographic techniques where the scenario is reversed ie the stationary phase is non-polar, while the mobile phase is polar
 prayek sthir or mobile charan kii tarah ve upyog main bhinn chrometography ke kai prakaar ke hote hai
 The differential similarity of the different components of the analyte towards the stationary and mobile phase results in the differential separation of the components: the basic principle however remains the same

 On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the display of over 30,000 unique documents and papers from Einstein
 oinstin ke bauddhik uplabdhiyon or apurvata ne "oinstin" shabd ko "budhimaan" kaa paryaay bana diya he
 Albert Einstein was born in Germany into a Jewish family in Wüttemberg
 unke pita ek ejeeniyar or celsman the
 His mother was Pauline Einstein

 He learned to play Sarangi at the behest of his mother
 unhen ye pasand nahin tha or baad me ise chhod bhi diya, lekin baad me unhe mozart ke sarangi sangeet me bahut anand aata tha
 In 1894, his father's company could not get a contract to supply for electric lighting in the city of Munich
 jiske kaaran huye nuksaan se unhen apni company bechni pad gai
 In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, where they first settled in Milan and then a few months later in the city of Pavia
 parivaar ke pavia jane ke baad bhi oinstin munich main hi apni padhai puri karne ke liye ruke rahen
 In late December 1894, he traveled to Italy to visit his family in Pavia

 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "

 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means

 His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena
 unhone saapekshata ke siddhant ko vyakt kiya
 Which, according to Herman Minkowski, is known for the generalization of alternation alternately from space to space-time

 This paper also argued that the idea of luminiferous ether was excessive
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata ke apane shodh-patr main, oinstin ne vishesh saapekshata samikarnon se E=mc2 ko nirmit kiya
 Since 1905 Einstein's research in relativity remained controversial for many years, although it was also accepted by many leading physicists such as Max Planck
 1905 ke ek patr main, oinstin bataaya kii ki prakaash swatah hi sthaneey kanon ke bane hote hai
 Einstein's light quanta hypothesis was rejected by almost all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Burr

 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat
 Can solve the problem
 peter dibai ne is model ko parishkrut kiya
 During the 1910s, it expanded to bring individual systems within the realm of quantum mechanics

 After the untimely demise of his father Maharaja Bishan Singh, on 25 January 1700, he sat on the throne of Amber at the age of almost 11 years of childhood
 aurangzeb ne unhen 'savai' kii oopaadhi di thi - jiskaa pratikatmak-arth yahi he ki ve apane samakalinon se 'savaya' the
 It is heard that when young Sawai Jaisingh first appeared in the court of Delhi Emperor Aurangzeb, it is not known why Aurangzeb suddenly grabbed both the hands of Jaisingh and asked "now tell me, what will you do?" At this, Jai Singh smiled directly at the lips and said with a very calm voice, "alampanah! We have a tradition of marriage among Hindus
" var, vadhoo kaa ek haath apane haath main lekar is baat kii pratigya karata he ki vah uskaa haath jindagi bhar nahi chhodega, umr bhar uskaa saath nibaahega! aaj badshaah salaamat khud meraa ek haath nahin, mere donon hi haath jab apane haath main le chuke hai, fir mujhe kis baat kii parvaah?" aurangzeb ko is chaturaai bhare jabaab kii ummid na thi, lekin is budhimattapurna haazirajavaabi se vah bahut prasann hua
 , yadunath sarkaar ne apane jaipur itihaas main is 'oopaadhi' ke bare main jo shabd likhe hai- avikal rup se ye hai-" The new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out," You are more than a man, you are sawa- i
e
,a hundred and twenty five per cent hero' Some other sources state that the title of 'sawai' was not given by Aurangzeb but by Emperor Farrukh Sayar

 Jaisingh II was born Margashirsha Vadi on 7 November 1745, on 3 November 1688 from Raja Vishnusingh's Rathore Queen, Indrakanwar, daughter of Thakur Keshari Singh of Kharwa in Ajmer

 The news of Bishan Singh's death in Kabul reached the royal camp of Maharashtra on 18 February 1700, usually one and a half months after his death, then two days later, the emperor Aurangzeb changed the name of his eldest son from Vijay Singh to Jai Singh, Accepted the heir to the throne of Amer
 badshaah ne jaisingh ke chote bhai cheema ji kaa naam vijaisingh rakhaa
 According to Yadunath Sarkar "


 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'strict calls' to attend him
 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade

 He was appointed as his military aide for the protection of Panhala near Aurangzeb's grandson Shah Bidarbakht when he reached the south in October 1701, battling difficult routes and rain-blocked routes
 aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke netritv main baadashahi sena ne 11 may i0 1702 ko khilanaa ke kile par baari hamalaa kiya
 In this Amer and Mughal combined forces suffered a lot of casualties, but by breaking its walls, the first Kachwaha army of Jai Singh entered the Blossom-fort
 uski burj par amer kaa 'pancharanga jhanda' fahraaya gaya
 
 khilanaa-yuddh main inkaa vir or bharosemand dewan buddhasingh maaraa gaya
 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht
 badshaah kii chah saal kii 'kathin seva' kaa mahaz yah pratidaan jaisingh ko mila! iske baad jab shahjada bidarbakht malwe kaa soobedaar hua, tab usne jaisingh kii sevaaon kaa sammaan karte un ko vahaan kaa naayab soobedaar bana diya, jise aurangzeb ne tatkaal hi 'naamanzoor' kar diya tathaa ek farmaan likhaa ki ainda kisi hindu bhi ko maamuli faujadaar tak bhi nahin banaaya jaae
 ' vidmbana haratangez he ki jis aurangzeb ne kabhi inhen 'savai' kah kar sammaan diya vahi baad main vastutah inase is kadar naaraaz or purvaagrahagrast tha ki usne ye apmanjanak ajna jari kii- "jaisingh ko masanad par asana na de kar, neeche zamin par bichhi 'sujani' par baithne ko kaha jaay!" Meanwhile, in AD 1704, two Badshahi Faujdars took local help and snatched the fief from Thakur Kushal Singh Rajawat to the Jhilaiya hideout located in Sawai Madhopur on 13 November 1704
 duusare saal i0 1705 main shah bidarbakht ne apni taraf se inke paksh main phir se koshish karke jaisingh ko malwa kaa bhi naayab soobedaar banavaa diya
 But as long as Aurangzeb survived, his influence in the Mughal camp remained mild

 In January 1708, he reached Amer and took it to Khalsa
 jaisingh se amer kii jaagir jabt karke badshaah bahadurshah dwaara 10 janvari 1708 ko unke chote bhai vijaisingh ko anekanek mahange uphaaron sahit de di gayi
 Sawai Jaisingh's political stature was reduced to a modest 'mansabdar'
 badshaah iske baad ajmer hokar dakshin ke liye apane bhai kambaksh se muqabla karne ko badha
 Both the kings of Amber and Jodhpur went with him to the area of mandleshwar
 jab unhen yah aashaa nahin rahi ki badshaah unke ilaake unhen waapas lautaaega to unhone durgadas rathod kii raay se, jab badshaah narbada nadi paar karne ko ravaanaa hua, 20 april 1708 baishakh sudi 13 ko baadashahi-shivi chhod diya or ve raajapootaana kii ore waapas ravaanaa hokar mewar udaipur pahunche

 The nerds attacked him suddenly with guns and arrows
 usamen sab mogul faujadaar maare gayi tathaa mughalon kii jiti hui baaji haath se nikal gai
 Then Jai Singh wrote a letter against the emperor to Durgadas that "speak to Udaipur Maharana 


 Rajputs should do what the pride of 'hindustan' should do against the Mughals, including the Marathas
 " When Emperor Bahadur Shah returned from the south, he considered it necessary to somehow compromise both the Jodhpur and Amer kings
 inhen laane ke liye usne budhsingh haada raja bundi ko bheja, jinke marfat 21 june i0 1710 ko ye ajmer ke paas badshaah ke saamne hajir hue
 The emperor returned the seized states to them and also gave the mansab of 4000 and 4000 riders to these two
 us samay tak bhi rajputon kaa mughalon par bilkul vishwaas nahin tha, isliye jab savai jaisingh ajmer main badshaah ke shivi main gayi tab ajmer ke tamaam pahaad tathaa ghaatiyaan rajput-sainikon se bhari hui thim
 He never had full faith in Bahadur Shah's intention even after Mansab grew and returned to the area
 jaisingh ke bhai vijaisingh ke saath bhi kuch aisa hua ki niraash hokar ant main mughal darbar chhod kar hindun aa gaye
 Jai Singh was still an armed rebellion threat from brother Vijay Singh

 The reason for this was - the Nizam and Qamruddin were in high positions in the empire at that time and they could be suspected to be responsible for Nadirshah's attack, but the Emperor kept believing in them and kept giving them necessary advice

 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics
