 Like this jahaan B=chumbakeey abhivah kaa ghanatv, l=chaalak kii lambaai, v=chaalak kaa veg 
 According to the above principle, there is Faraday's second principle, which is actually its supplement: - aropit bal ko nimnlikhit sameekaran se vyakt kiya ja saktaa he - Where f = force applied on the conductor, b = magnetic charge density, l = length of conductor and i = current flowing in the conductor

 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 Later, on Ramachandra Deb establishing an independent kingdom in Khurda, the temple and its idols were restored
 
 According to the traditional legend associated with the origin of this temple, the original idol of Lord Jagannath made of Indranil or Sapphire was found under an Agaru tree
 yah itani chakchaundh karne vaali thi, ki dharm ne ise prithvi ke neeche chupaana chaha
 Malwa King Indradyumna saw this idol in his dream
 tab usne kadi tapasya kii or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne use bataaya ki vah puri ke samudr tat par jaye or use ek daaru kaa laththa milegaa
 He should build the idol with the same wood
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or use lakdi kaa laththa mil bhi gaya
 The king then appeared before him as Vishnu and Vishwakarma carpenter artisan and sculptor
 kintu unhone yah shart rakhi, ki ve ek maah main murti taiyaar kar denge, parantu tab tak vah ek kamare main band rahenge or raja yaa koi bhi us kamare ke andar nahin aaye
 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin
 Then the idols of the same three Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were installed in the temple

 In his last days, he had also asked that the world famous Kohinoor diamond, which is the most valuable and the largest diamond in the world, be donated to this temple
 lekin yah sambhav naa ho sakaa, kyoki us samay tak, british ne punjab par apana adhikaar karke, unki sabhi shahi sampatti jabt kar lee thi
 Otherwise Kohinoor diamond would have been the pride of the crown of Lord Jagannath

 kolkata railway stesan, jise purv me chitpur stesan ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, kolkata or haavda shaharon me bane chaar intercity railway stations me se ek he
 iske alaava sialdah stesan shalimaar stesan or haavda stesan bhi in do shaharon me bane hai

 In the place where this station is built today, there was a big Malgodam in a mummy
 vartmaan me jahaan bas or car parking bani he or saath hi stesan jane vaala maarg bhi purv me malgadee me koyala ladane ke liye bana ek bada sa yard tha
 At present, where the platforms are built, Malgadia used to stop and this whole complex was known as Chitpur Rail Yard
 saal 2000 me sialdah se hokar jane vaale or khulne vaali gadiyon kii sankhya me betahasa vruddhi ke kaaran is parisar ko ek yatri stesan ke rup me viksit karne kii yojana banaai gayi
 jagah kii kami ke kaaran sialdah me or adhik platoform nahi banaae ja sakate the or kolkata ke madhya me sthit hone ke kaaran yahan par mahanagareey rail seva bhi zyaada vyastata utpann karti he
 To solve all these problems, the Middle East Railway proposed the construction of another big station for long distance trains in Kolkata
 Many places were considered for the proposed station
 The name of Mazerhat first came up, but due to the difficulties of building a bridge from Bauria to Buzg over the Hooghly River, this idea had to be abandoned
 iske baad haavda me sthit shalimaar stesan ke upar vichaar kiya gaya
 is sthaan par pehle se hin dakshin-purv railway ke tahat malgadiya chalaa karti thi
 From here, a pair of passenger trains were also started as an experiment
 But due to lack of basic resources and its distance from Kolkata city, this effort also could not be successful
 antat chitpur ko hi naye vrahat railway stesan me badalane ke prastaav ko saal 2003-04 me rail mantralay kii anumati mil gayi
 kolkata ke madhya me sthit hone or ek shatabdi se bhi adhik samay se malwahak terminal ke rup me karyrat hone ke kaaran iske chunaav ko atirikt bal mila
 iske alaava shalimaar or mazerhat kii tulana me yahan stesan ke aas-paas kii parisampattiyaan bhi railway ke hi paas thi
 The proposal was soon approved by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority and on 15 May 2003, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laid the foundation of the project
 2004 me is stesan ke nirmaan kaa kaary shuru kiya gaya or janvari 2006 me iskaa adhikarik rup se udghaatan kiya gaya
 The station is connected to sealdah-ranaghat-krishnanagar-berhampur-lalgola line and is served by the South Eastern Railway from Naihati, Bandel, Kalyani Simanta, Gede, Shantipur, Krishnanagar, Berhampur, Lalgola, Dankuni, Kolkata Airport, Bongaon, Hasanabad and others
 Train service to destinations is operated
 The number of metropolitan service trains is much less than long distance trains
 From here, two long-distance express trains run along with two poor Rath Express and one long-distance passenger train - Lalgola Passenger
 There are a total of five platforms out of which platform 1 and 2 are reserved for metropolitan trains and platform for 3,4,5 long distance trains
 The only international train in the Eastern region is the kolkata-dhaka Maitree Express which opens from this station

 Such orders have certain standard instructions
 ve is prakaar se hai
 a stop loss is the value of a stock or index at which the transaction is closed after reaching it
 vittiya bazaar main kisi bhi kharide jane vaale share ke bhav ke upar jane kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he or neeche jane kii ashanka bhi bani rahati he
 If the stock price starts to fall, then it can reach quite low
 atev share kray karte samay hi iske stop los ko tay kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a share of 100 rupees is taken, then it should be sold when it comes to 95 or 90 rupees
 isse adhik neeche bhav pahunchane par bhi ise kis keemat tak rakhana he, yaa bechnaa he; yahi stop los hota he
 According to the experts, it is more beneficial to decide about stop loss while buying shares
 yah suvidha brokar ke computer main uplabdh hoti he
 Successful and experienced stock investors always keep an eye on return estimates and stop losses
 stop los ko stop order bhi kaha jaataa he
 In the table of the rising price data of a stock, the place where the share price crosses the trend line and goes down, is the stoploss of that stock
 isi tarah mandi ke saudon main bhav jahaan trend line ko katkar upar aa jaae, vahiin un saudon kaa stoplos hota he
 When stoploss is increased or decreased with sentiment, it is called trailing stoploss
 ye kai prakaar ke hote hai: The graph of the price of a stock ascending in the market from which it turns downward, the position or position is called the top or the top
 isi tarah girte hue bhav main graph jahaan se chadhana shuru kar detaa he, vahiin bottm kehalaata he
 Top and bottom have great importance in technical analysis
 yadi kisi chart main har aglaa top or bottm kramash: pichley top or bottm se ooncha ho, to share yaa suchakank teji ke daur main kehalaata he
 Similarly, if every next top and bottom in a chart is below the previous top and bottom respectively, then the stock or index is considered in a recession
 share ke bhav ke baar chart main kisi share ke har din ke ucchtam or nunatam bhaavon ko ek sidhi rekha se jodne par jo rekha milti he, rujhaan rekha yaa trend line kehalaati he
 The falling stock's trend line draws the line from the highest price of that stock, while the line is drawn from the lowest price to draw the trend line of the rising stock
 behatar parinaam hetu kisi ek din ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhav kii jagah kai dinon ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhaavon ke ghanatv vaale kshetron se rekha khinchi jaati he
 The trade line is extremely helpful for investors, also known as the trend is the best friend in English
 trend tuutane kaa arth hota he ki share kii chaal kii disha badalane vaali he
 That is, if the stock price is falling and the prices of the stock suddenly start coming upwards after cutting the trend line drawn from above, then it should be understood that the edge is going to start
 iske ulat agar chadhate hue share yaa index ke nichle bhav se khinchi gai rujhaan rekha keemton ke upar jane lage, to teji ke saude kaat lene chahie
 By tracking returns and estimating returns, profit-recovery is simplified when the investor is informed of financial goals
 yah is nirnay ko aasaan banaata he ki niveshak ko kisi kaarobaar vishesh main nivesh karnaa laabhprad he yaa nahin
 According to experts, if the return-risk ratio is not in favor then it should not be traded
 jaise, yadi 100 rupye ke lakshya ke saath 90 rupye kaa koi share kharidte hai or stop los 75 rupye se neeche he to ritern-jokhim anupaat paksh main nahin he
 In this case, after selling the shares at the target price, they are willing to take a loss of Rs 15 per share for an expected profit of Rs 10 per share
 is tarah se ritern kii tulana main jokhim adhik he or samajhadaari he ki is share main paisa na lagaaein
 Thus stop loss information is very helpful in deciding to invest
 adhikansh vishleshkon ko lagata he ki trederon ko jokhim sahane kii kshamta ke aadhaar par stop los tay karnaa chahie

 Brandy is a alcohol which is usually obtained by distillating the fermented juices of fruits
 isamen 35 se 60% tak alcohol hota he
 It is usually consumed after dinner
 yadi kisi anya fal kaa ullekh na ho, to brandi kaa aashay angoor ke ras se praapt asut se hota he
 In brandy, the characteristics of the fruit, from which it is prepared, remain very much, but in the process of distillation, the aroma is destroyed
 kisi anya fal ke kinvit ras se praapt asut main brandi ke saath us falvishesh kaa naam jod diya jaataa he, jaise 'seb kii brandi', 'akhrot kii brandi' aadi
 Additionally, brandy is sometimes named after a grape from a geographical region, such as brandy derived from grapes originating in the province of France, known as 'conyque brandy'
 brandi main alcohol kii maatra aaytan ke anusaar 85% se kam hoti he
 In distilled wines, grape brandy, or only brandy, is probably the oldest

 The term Konyek brandy is reserved for brandy originating from these regions
 konyek nagar sharant praant kii rajdhani he
 The climate of this region of France is not conducive to the production of edible grapes, because the variety of grapes produced in this region has high acid content, which makes the grapes very sour
 angoor kaa yah amla kinvan kii kriya main ek vishesh prakaar ke teevr suvasit aster ko utpann karata he
 This ester is also distilled from the distillation and the brandy obtained is flavored with this ester, which is characteristic of Konyak brandy

 praarambhik bijganit main dhan or rin chihnon se sambanddh kai padon ke vyanjak ko bahupad kehete hai, yatha 
 Its specific surnames are 'ekapada', 'dwipad', etc
 according to the number of posts
 ucchtar ganit main bahupad kaa vishisht upyog aise vyanjak ke liye hota he jiske padon main kisi ek char raashi, yaa ek se adhik char raashiyon, ke shunya athwa dhan purnank ghaat aaroh yaa avaroh kram main ho, yatha Is a polynomial of expression and x, yz, and is constant
 yadi ke sthaan main sarvatra koi anya vyanjak maan len, log x rakh diya jaae, to nayaa vyanjak log x kaa vyanjak kehalaayegaa
 Among the powers of terms, the greatest is called the power of the polynomial
 yadi ek se adhik char rashiyaan hon, to vibhinn padon main char raashiyon ke ghaaton ke yogafalon main se mahattam ko bahupad kaa ghaat kehete hai
 Thus, the power of a polynomial is 4 and 7
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki bahupad main chathe ghaat kaa or main dwitiya ghaat kaa he
 The sum, difference, and product of two polynomials are polynomials, but their quotient is not a polynomial
 do bahupadon ke bhagfal ko, jinamein ek sankhya maatr bhi ho saktaa he, parimey falan kehete hai
 The comprehensive polynomial of power in the variable is: bijganit kaa ek moulik prameya yah he ki yadi f char raashi x main ghaat m kaa bahupad he, to bahupad sameekaran f = 0 ke sadaa m mul hote hai
 These can also be basic composite and concurrent
 yadi f = 0 kaa koi mul p1 he to bahupad f main kaa bhaag puraa-puraa chalaa jaataa he or bhagfal main ghaat m-1 vaala ek bahupad f1 praapt hota he
 Now the polynomial equation f1 = 0 will have m-1 root and if it has a root, then the part in f1 will be completely gone
 yah ek mahatvapurn prameya he ki f kaa gunankhandan adwitiya hota he
 If we restrict the numbers used in the coefficients and factors of f to the fact that they belong to a certain area, then the roots do not exist
 itnaa avashya he ki yadi bahupad kaa gunankhandan ho sakegaa, to gunankhand adwitiya honge
 An important theorem of trigonometry is that if m is a positive integer, then the expression of cosine mx can be expressed as a polynomial with m power of cosine x, as jya mx ke bare main prameya yah he ki yadi m visham he to jya mx kii abhivyakti jya x ke m wein ghaat ke bahupad ke rup main kii ja sakati he or yadi m sam he to jya mx / kojya x kii abhivyakti jya x ke m-1 wein ghaat ke bahupad ke rup main hogi, yatha Curves in analytical geometry are studied by representing them by polynomial equations of two variables

 Politics gateway rajmukut athwa da crown, ek vishesh raajnneetik sankalpana he, jisaki britain tathaa anya rashtramandal pradeshon ke vidhishastra tathaa rajatantric vyavastha main atimahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This thinking was developed during the feudalistic period in the Kingdom of England to address literal crowns and national estates by dividing them from the sovereign and his / her personal property
 is soch ke anusaar rajmukut ko prashasan ke samast angon tathaa har aayam main rajya tathaa shashan ke pratik ke rup main dekha jaataa he, tathaa british samprabhu ko rajmukut ke satat avatar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, in Britain and the Commonwealth territories, this terminology is also used as an epithet for governance or government, or it may be said directly that this is another way of addressing the monarchy itself
 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he
 Therefore, in this context the word should not be confused with the actual crown of any royal dress
 ek santhaan ke rup main, rajmukut, britain kii raajnneetikvyavastha kaa sabase purana kaaryshil santhaan he
 Over the centuries, this concept reached many other corners of the world through the first English and then British colonial expansion respectively, and today it is, apart from the United Kingdom, the administrative system of the other 15 independent nations and three deviant Mukti dependencies and the basic foundations of the legal system
 i am inlaid
 inamen se prayek raashtra ke shashan ek-duusare se purnatah vibhakt hai, parantu saare ke saare samaan rup se ek hi rajpariwaar ko saajha karte hai
 Thus, despite being a monarch, the "rajmukuts" of all these nations are independent of each other
 is shabd ko or bhi kai aadhikarik shabdon main dekha ja saktaa he, udhaahranswaroop:mukut ke mantri, mukuteey bhoomi, ityadi
 This present concept of the crown has developed in hundreds of years during the feudal system in England
 paaramparik rup se england main shashan karne kaa param adhikaar, keval adhirat ke haathon main rahaa he, tathaa samast adhinsth adhikariyon evam prashasnic va nyaayik sansthaanon ke shashan-adhikaar ke antyat strot, adhirat hi hua karte the
 Hence the courts and all administrative documents were written in the style of addressing the "crown", that is, the rule was referred to as "rajmukut"
 sansad kii sthapana, megna carta kaa lagu hon, tathaa angrezi grihayuddh jaisi ghatnaon ke zarie, anek varshon ke antaraal par vaastavik shasnadhikaar, kramshah mukut se sansad ke haathon main hastantarit ho gaya, parantu shashan ko us hi style dwaara sambodhit kiya jaataa tha
 It is necessary to know here that this is not under any established rule, but the tradition has developed progressively over many years
 aadhunik loktantric pranali main, drudh rajtantron ke viruddh, padasth samprabhu, keval ek paramparaagat pad hota he, jisaki aam taur tara koi bhi vaastavik shakti nahin hoti he
 In contrast, all authority and powers are in the hands of elected government officials, and traditionally as the holders of authority, the ruler functions only in consultation with the representative of the government
 atah, jahaan pehle, "rajmukut" yaa "crown" shabd ko rajasatta tathaa rajatantric shashan va shaasha ke sambodhan ke liye upyog kiya jaataa tha, vahiin, sansad kii sthapana tathaa kramshah saare sarthak shashan-shaktiyon kaa, mukut se sansad ke haathon main hastantarit hone ke pashchaat, aaj yah shabd multah ek paramparaagat avshesh he, jise aajkal, rajya tathaa sarkaar yaa shashan ko sambodhit karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he tathaa rashtrapramukh hone ke naate, samprabhu ko kathith "mukut" atah "rajya" ke maanviya pratinidhi tathaa pratik ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Thus, in the current constitutional-monarchical system, "crown" is basically another way of addressing the circus
 tathaa kathith "rajmukut" or "rajmukuteey sampatti" multah rajkeey yaa saarvajanik sampatti he jise ganatantric deshon main aam shabdon main sarkari sampatti kaha jaataa he
 Therefore, according to this concept, the Rajmukut and Rajamukooti property are separated from the ruler and his personal property, that is, the Rajamukuti property cannot be considered as the personal property of the ruler
 balki, rajmukuteey sampatti asal main saarvajanik yaa sarkari sampatti hoti he
 However, in the end, the entire Commonwealth region is the crown owner of all properties and wealth, and all the ownerless properties also own the crown
 shaasha ko mukut tathaa rajya ke jivit maanviya rup main dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, the body of a king is the holder of two distinct personalities: one of a human being born in general, and, by laws, of the whole princely state; Hence "both crown and king are perceptually divided, but judicially the same

 He has the right to ownership, not by an individual, but by his right to be the ruler
 atah in par malikatv ke saare adhikaar ve nijee ichha-anusaar nahi, balki, sanvaidhanik rup se unke pad par nihit adhikaron, shaktiyon or simaaon ke aadhaar par hi kar sakate hai
 Therefore, they can exercise the right of ownership over this property only by the advice and approval of their respective ministers
 aitihaasik taur par rajmukut ko avibhaajaneey mana jaataa tha, parantu samay ke saath yah dharna bhi parivartit hoti gayi, or aaj, un prayek pradesh, praant yaa rajya, jo angrezi mukut ko rashtrapramukh ke rup main dekhte hai, main, us pradesh kii swaittata kii maatr se bemuravvat, swatantra mana jaataa he

 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc

 Alzheimer's disease is one of the first parts of the brain to be damaged; Memory related difficulties and status problems are its first symptoms
 Damage to the hippocampus can also occur due to oxygen deficiency, encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy

 Since different types of neuronal cells are clearly present in the surfaces of the hippocampus, it is often used as an ideal system for the study of neurophysiology
 The type of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation was first found in the hippocampus and has since been studied only in this form
 LTP is widely considered to be similar to the main neural process by which memory is saved in the brain

 Another mythological reference came with the word pes hippocampi, which has its origins in 1672 by Diemerbroek, comparing it to the mythical hippocampus, which has folded forepaws and webbed feet, a sea monster whose forehead and fish
 Like a tail
 The hippocampus at that time was described as the Pace Hippocampi Major and was the protrusion of an adjacent ossipital horn, called Calcar Avis, named Pace Hippocampi Minor
 The reason for naming the hippocampus as hippocampus major and calcar avis as hippocampus minor was in 1786 by Felix wik-d'ezir's system of naming parts of the brain
 Maier erroneously used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by several authors until the error was corrected by Karl Friedrich Burdack in 1829
 In 1861, the Hippocampus Minor caused a dispute between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen over the evolution of humans, which led to satire on the question of the Great Hippocampus
 The term Hippocampus Minor ceased to be used in anatomy textbooks and was officially removed in 1895 in Noumina Anatomica
 aajkal, is sanrachana ko hippocampus major ke sthaan par hippocampus kaha jaataa he, pes hippocampi ko di gerenziot ke "kornu emmonis" ke samanaarthi shabd ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he, yah naam hippocampus ke chaar mukhya hystology vibhaajan ke naamon main bachaa rah gaya he: sie1, CA2, CA3 tathaa CA4
 Historically, the earliest known concept was that the hippocampus belongs to the olfactory sense
 Anatomy tests conducted in the early 70s showed that the hippocampus does not receive direct instructions from the olfactory bulb
 However, subsequent research has proven that the olfactory bulb must project to the ventral portion of the lateral entorhinal cortex, and the field CA1 in the ventral hippocampus transmits axons to the main olfactory bulb, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and the primary olfactory cortex
 People have been interested in the hippocampal olfactory response, particularly regarding the role of the hippocampus in memory of odors, but few today believe that its main function is related to olfaction

 The second major ideology connects the hippocampus with memory
 Although preceding examples of this are available, the main inspiration for this idea is a famous report by Scoville and Brenda Milner, in which a patient, Henry Gustav Molais, who died until his death in 2008, HM
 The hippocampus was surgically destroyed
 The unexpected result of this operation was the appearance of severe anterograde and partial retrograde amnesia: H
M
 After his surgery he was unable to make experimental memories and he could not remember the events immediately preceding the operation, but he remembered the events of years before, such as his childhood
 In this case, the interest of the people increased so much that H
M
 Became the most intensively studied medical subject
 In the following years, other patients, including approximately the same level of hippocampal damage and amnesia, Thousands of physiological experiments were conducted, including mobility-based changes of the synapses in the hippocampus
 It is now agreed throughout the world that the hippocampus plays some specific role in memory, although the exact form of this role is not yet known

 Psychologists and neuroscientists generally agree that the hippocampus plays a specific role in the formation of new memories, which are related to experience
 As part of this role, the function of the hippocampus is also to identify special events, locations and stimuli
 Some researchers consider the hippocampus to be part of the larger medial temporal lobe memory system responsible for general cognitive memory
 hippocampus ko gambhir kshati pahunchane par nayi smritiyaan banane main bahut kathinaayee hoti he or aksar yah is kshati se pehle bani smritiyon ko bhi prabhavit karti he 
 haalanki yah retrogred prabhaav saamaanya rup se mastishk kshati ke kuch varshon purv tak hi failata he, kuch maamalon main isse puraani smritiyaan surakshit rahati hai - is puraani smritiyon ke batch jane se is vichaar ko bal miltaa he ki samay ke saath smritiyaan hippocampus se mastishk ke anya bhaagon main sthanantarit ho jaati hai
 Damage to the hippocampus does not affect certain types of memory - such as the ability to learn new motor or cognitive skills
 This fact shows that such abilities depend on other types of memories and relate to other areas of the brain
 In addition, patients with amnesia often display "indirect" memory for the experience, while they consciously lack that knowledge
 For example, when asked to a patient which of the two faces has been seen recently, he gives the correct answer most of the times, although he also states that he has never seen both these faces
 
 Some researchers differentiate between conscious recall, which depends on the hippocampus, and similarity, which depends on other parts of the medial temporal cortex

 With the help of hundreds of experiments of spatial reactions on mice and mice, which have been going on for more than four decades, we have a large amount of information available
 Spatial cells are reacted by pyramidal-shaped cells in the main hippocampus and granular cells of dentate gyrus
 Together these form most of the neurons located in the dense layers of the hippocampus
 Inhibitory interneurons, which make up the majority of the remaining cells, often cause spatial variation in excretion rates, but are much lower than pyramidal-shaped or annular-shaped cells
 The topographic representation in the spatial description is very small: cells in each other in the hippocampus usually have a very different form of spatial emission
 When the rat is outside its locus, the endemic cells are usually quiet, But when he approaches the center, he achieves a sustained rate, which can be up to 40 Hz
 On the basis of neural activity obtained from 30–40 random spatial cell samples, it appears that there is so much information collected in them that the rat can reassert its position with certainty
 The size of the placenta varies in proportion to the size of the hippocampus, the cells at the dorsal end represent the smallest area, the cells near the center represent the larger area, and the cells at the ventral end cover the entire enclosure
 In some cases, the excretion rate of the rat's hippocampal cells depends not only on the location but also on the direction the rat is moving, the target it is moving toward, and other work-related variables

 Brain imaging suggests that individuals with more active hippocampus are able to guide better, as proved by computer simulation-based "virtual" guidance
 In addition, there is evidence that the hippocampus plays a role in finding shorter pathways and finding new routes between known locations
 For example, London taxi drivers must have knowledge of a large number of places and the most direct routes to reach them
 a study conducted by Magwire and others 

 at University College London revealed that the hippocampus of taxi drivers was larger than others and the hippocampi of more experienced drivers was larger
 a large hippocampus helps a person to become a taxi driver, or to explore shorter routes for living increases the size of a person's hippocampus
 However, studies conducted by Magwire and others 

 explored the correlation between the size of the gray matter and its duration as a taxi driver, and its duration as a taxi driver and the volume of the right hippocampus
 a positive correlation was found in
 It was found that the total volume of the hippocampus remained unchanged in the control group versus taxi drivers
 This means that the posterior portion of the hippocampus of taxi drivers must have increased in size, but at the cost of the anterior part
 The deleterious effects of this altered ratio of parts of the hippocampus are not yet known

 The hippocampus in its entire shape resembles a twisted tube, which is thought to resemble a sea horse, sheep horn, or banana
 This can typically be seen as an area where the cortex is thinned and transformed into a dense layer of pyramidal shaped neurons, which can range in thickness from 3 to 6 cells in mice, and in English
 u is bent in shape; The CA4 region at the edge of the u is embedded backward in the form of a folded, strongly folded V-shaped cortex, called dentate gyrus
 It consists of ventral and dorsal parts, whose components are the same but they are part of different circuits of neurons
 This common layout is almost the same in all mammals, right from humans, although their descriptions vary
 In mice, both hippocampi resemble a pair of bananas, Which connect to the hippocampal commissure at the origin and extend to the inner corpus callosum
 In the brain of humans or monkeys, the parts of the hippocampus at the bottom, which are towards the base of the temporal lobe, are wider than the parts above
 One of the consequences of this complex geometry is that transverse cuts in the hippocampus can exhibit different sizes, although this also depends on the angle and position of the cut

 Several other combinations play a major role in the function of the hippocampus
 In addition to delivering output to the EC, other output pathways also connect other cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex
 a very important and large output also goes to the lateral septal area and the mammary body of the hypothalamus
 The region CA1 of the hippocampus also receives input from various divisions such as the serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine systems, and the nucleus reunions of the thalamus
 a very important projection comes from the medial septal region that sends cholinergic and gabergic fibers to all parts of the hippocampus
 Input from the septal region plays a major role in the control of the physiological state of the hippocampus: destruction of the septal region destroys the theta rhythm of the hippocampus and severely adversely affects certain types of memories

 The hippocampus displays two "modes" of activity, each of which is related to a specific pattern of neural number activity and to waves of electrical activity that can be measured with the help of an electroencephalogram
 Both these modes are named after their respective EEG formats: Theta and Large Irregular Activity
 The main features described below are for the rat, which is the animal that has been studied the most
 theta mod sakriy, chaukanne vyavhaar ke dauraan pradarshit hota he, yah aariem neend ke dauraan bhi hota he

 LEA mode appears in a state of slow sleep and activity without being awake, such as when resting and eating
 In LEA mode the EEG is underlain by strong waves, which are randomly deflected EEG signals and last for 200–300 ms
 These sharp waves also reflect the neural activity pattern of the population
 In between all these pyramidal shaped and annular shaped cells remain very quiet
 During these intense waves, up to 5–10% of the total neurons emit action potentials that occur over a period of 50 ms; Many of these cells emit many action potentials

 The hippocampus, due to its dense neural layers, produces more intense EEG signals than any other brain structure
 In some cases e EG these subthresholds reflect membrane potentials and strongly modulate the spiking of neutrons of the hippocampus, and bring the entire hippocampus together like a moving wave
 This EEG format is called theta rhythm
 Theta rhythm is very evident in rabbits and vermin and can also be seen in cats and dogs
 Whether theta can be seen even in apes is an unpleasant question
 In mice, theta is seen mainly in two conditions: first, when the animal is moving or in some other form actively acting on the objects around it; Second, during REM sleep
 The function of theta has not been fully explained satisfactorily, Although many theories have been proposed in this subject
 In the most popular hypothesis it has been related to learning and memory
 For example, the phase in which the theta exerts formula-coupling under the influence of this stimulus when stimulating neuron and consequently affects synaptic plasticity-based learning and memory
 It has been fully proven that damage to the medial septum - which is the central point of the theta system - causes severe side effects in memory
 Although, the medial septum is more important than just the theta being neuter, it is the main source of cholinergic projection to the hippocampus
 It has not been proven that theta rhythm in particular worsens as a result of damage to the septal

 An interesting aspect of intense waves is that they appear to be associated with memory
 Wilson and mcnaughton 1994, and many other studies found that when spatial cells of the hippocampus overlapped with spatial emission zones, they exhibit correlated activity during sleep after a practical session
 This increase of correlation, commonly known as reactivation, is found to occur during intense waves
 It has been proposed that these rapid waves are in fact the reactivation of neural activities that were involved in memory during behavior, driven by synaptic improvements within the hippocampus
 This idea forms the core of the "two-level memory" theory, which was approved by Buzsáki and others, kam se kam reman vaai kejaal ke samay se hi manovaigyanik yah anumaan laga rahe the mastishk smriti kaa bhandaran samasamyik rup se sakriy neurunon ke bich sampark kii shakti ko parivartit karke karata he

 The hippocampus was particularly suitable for the study of LTP because it contained dense and clear layers of neurons, but now many such activity-dependent synaptic changes can be seen in many parts of the brain
 The most studied form of LTP occurs in synapses that terminate in the dendritic spine and use the transmitter glutamate
 Several major pathways of the hippocampus fit this description and exhibit LTP
 Synaptic changes depend on a particular type of glutamate receptor, called the NMDA receptor, a special feature of this is that it allows calcium to enter the postsynaptic spine only when presynaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization occur at the same time
 
 Drugs that interfere with the NMDA receptor Also blocks LTP and affects certain types of memory, especially spatial memory
 Transgenic mice, which are genetically modified to have LTP processes disabled, usually exhibit severe memory defects

 In mice, in relation to which detailed studies of cellular physiology are available, there is not much cell damage in the hippocampus as we age, but due to this, there are many changes in the synaptic contacts
 Functional formulators disappear in the dentate gyrus and CA1 region, and NMDA receptor-mediated responses are also reduced
 These changes can impair induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation, a type of hepatic plasticity that was indicated in memory
 Many genes associated with formulaic plasticity cause an age-related decline in hippocampus-related expression
 Eventually, they also differ in the performance stability of the "place cell"
 In young mice, When they are taken to another environment, the arrangement of the place field usually changes, but if the rat is taken back to an environment where he has come before, then this arrangement remains the same as before
 In older mice, the place field "remap" often fails when the rat is moved to a different environment and often fails to adjust its actual arrangement even when the rat is returned to the same environment

 The hippocampus is often the main focus of epileptic seizures: in temporal lobe epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosis is the type of tissue decay most commonly seen
 However, it is still unclear whether epilepsy occurs due to irregularity in the functioning of the hippocampus or that the hippocampus is damaged due to the cumulative effect of these seizures
 An experimental mechanism, where these seizures are induced artificially in animals, often results in damaged hippocampus: this may be due to the fact that the hippocampus is electrically the most stimulated part of the brain
 It can also be related to the fact that the hippocampus is one of the few areas of the brain where new neurons are produced for lifelong

5 semi 3 tak hota he, jabaki niocortex main yah failaav 320-420 semi 3 tak hota he
 There is also a general relationship between the size of the hippocampus and spatial memory
 When a comparison is made between two similar species, the species that have greater spatial memory capacity also have greater hippocampal dilatation
 This relationship also applies to gender differences: in species where there is considerable difference between males and females in relation to spatial memory capacity, they also exhibit differences in the spread of the hippocampus accordingly
 gaiyr-standhari prajatiyon kii mashtishk sanrachana stanadhariyon ke hippocampus ke samaan nahi hoti lekin uname jo mashtishk sanrachana hoti he vah stanadhariyon ke homologs hoti he
 hippocampus, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, anivaary rup se cortex kaa madhyavarti sira hota he
 keval stanadhariyon main hi purna viksit cortex hoti he, lekin vah sanrachana jisase ki isaki utpatti hui he jise palium kehete hai, vah sabhi rishadhariyon main paayi jaati he, yahaan tak ki sabase praathmik str ke rishadhariyon jaise lampre yaa hegfish main bhi
 aam taur par palium teen hisson main vibhajit hota he: madhyavarti, parshvik or prishthiya
 madhyavarti palium hippocampus ke purvavarti bhaag kaa nirmaan karata he
 yah dekhne main hippocampus jaisaa nahin dikhataa kyonki isaki parten s ke aakar main vikrut nahi hoti hai yaa dentate jirus dwaara nimagn nahin hoti hai, lekin gahari rasinic or kriyaatmak samanta ke dwaara inaki homolojee ke sanket milte hai
 ab is baat ke bhi pramaan hai ki ye hippocampus jaisi sanrachanaayen pakshiyon, sarisrupon or machhliyon main sthanik smriti se bhi sambandhit hoti hai
 This similarity is so apparent in birds that many anatomists refer to the medial pallial portion by the name "avian hippocampus"
 Many species of birds have specific spatial skills, mainly those who store food
 There is also evidence that birds storing food have a larger size of the hippocampus than other types of birds, and damage to the hippocampus damages their spatial memory
 machhliyon ke sambandh main yah tathy or bhi jatil he
 teleost machhlee main, mashtishk kaa agrasira anya rishadhariyon kii tulana main vikrut hota he: adhikansh neuro sharir rachana vigyaniyon kaa yah maananaa he ki teleost machhliyon ke mashtishk kaa agrasira isliye aavashyak rup se muda hua hota he, jaise ki ek mojey ke andruni hisse ko baahar mode diya jaye, jisase ki adhiktar rishadhariyon ke aatanrik sire kii sanrachanaayen joki nilay ke thik bagal main sthit hoti hai, ve teleost machhlee main bahaar kii ore pai jaayen, or iskaa thik vipareet bhi satya hota he
 iskaa ek parinaam yah he ki ek adarsh rishadhari kii madhyavarti palium ek adarsh machhlee kii parshvik palium ke tadnurup maani jaati he
 prayogon ke aadhaar par yah dikhaaya gaya he kii kai prakaar kii machhliyon main vishisht sthanik kaushal kshamtaayen hoti hai, yahaan tak ki jis sthaan main ve rahati hai unak "sangyaan aadhaarit maanchitr" banaae kii pratibha bhi hoti he
 yah is baat kaa pramaan he ki parshvik palium main hone vaali kshati se sthanik smriti ko bhi kshati pahunchati he
 Thus, the role of the hippocampus region in relation to marine life seems to have begun long before the origins of the spinal cord, even those fragments that date back hundreds of millions of years
 It is not yet known whether the intermediate pallium plays the same role in other primary vertebrates
 Some types of insects and oysters, such as octopus, also have specific spatial skills and navigational abilities, but function differently from the spatial system of mammals, so there is still no sufficient reason to think that they originated as one
 Originated from the source itself; Nor do they have sufficient similarity in brain structures to help identify any part of the species, such as the "hippocampus"
 However, some people have proposed that the function of the pseudo-rupture structure of insects may be similar to that of the hippocampus

 Rajkamal Prakashan was established on 28 February 1947
 us samay desh swatantra nahin hua tha lekin vibhaajan kii ashankaon ke bich aazaadee kii dastak saaf sunai de rahi thi
 During such transition period, this publication was started with a resolve to strengthen the cultural aspect of the country and underline the identity of Hindi language and society
 iske sansthaapak the hindi ke suprasiddh sahityakar dow0 devraj
 As the publication expanded, he called his brother Omprakash ji to conduct the publication and thus Omprakash ji became the managing director of Rajkamal Prakashan
 kaary kii drushti se omprakash ji hi raajakmal ke vaastavik sansthaapak siddh hue
 With his sharp knowledge and skill to communicate with the writers, he took Rajkamal to the heights of publication in a short time
 raajakmal prakaashan kaa vikaas ek privet limited sanstha ke rup main hua he
 It is not in the form of one's personal or ancestral property, but its ownership is determined on the basis of shares
 is prakaar aarambh main iskaa swaamitv aruna asaf ali ke paas tha
 She had difficulty in publishing this issue due to differences with Omprakash ji on some issues, when Sheela Sandhu's husband Hardev Sandhu bought most shares of this publication from her and in the event of some differences, the managing director of Omprakash ji After leaving the post, Sheela Sandhu took over the post of Managing Director despite being often unaware of the Hindi language
 omprakash ji ne apana swatantra prakaashan santhaan radhakrishna prakaashan ke naam se khol liya
 He had personal relationships with many writers and hence many eminent writers like Mohan Rakesh turned away from Rajkamal
 shila sandhu ko duhari-tihari kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, par unhone haar nahin maani
 Sheela Sandhu was a woman with a higher education and a world view, but difficulties were natural due to being away from the Hindi language and the Hindi speaking community
 aise samay main raajakmal prakaashan se namvar singh prakaashan salaahkaar ke rup main jude
 "from June 1, 1965, Namvar took full responsibility of looking after all the literary matters of Rajkamal
 unhen pustak-prakaashan ke nirnay ke atirikt 'nai kahaniyaan' evam 'aalochana' patrikaon kii nitiyon par bhi drushti rakhane ko kaha gaya
 "in the words of Sheila Sandhu herself", the role of the mentor of Namvar Singh, the master of magical oratory and teaching style, was as much necessary to me as Rajkamal in this difficult time
 " haalaanki unki bhoomika se achaanak sahitya kii dalgat va nijee raajnneeti kii samasya bhi uthi parantu dhire-dhire yah sab dur hua or raajakmal prakaashan unchaaiyon ko choota gaya
 Dr
 Namwar Singh played an important role in connecting Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi and Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma to Rajkamal Publications
 acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi kii pustak chaaru chandralekh kaa prakaashan pehle hi omprakash ji dwaara raajakmal se ho chukaa tha
 Now with the efforts of Namwar Singh, most of his and Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma's books were published with Rajkamal Prakashan
 swayan shila sandhu ne bhi apane drudh sankalp ke bal par hindi seekhney ke saath-saath anekanek lekhakon se acha judaav banaakar raajakmal se joda
 Rajendra Singh Bedi, Upendranath Ashk, Nemichandra Jain, Bhishma Sahni, Bharat Bhushan Agarwal, Nirmala, Suresh Awasthi, Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena, Nirmal Verma, Kunwar Narayan, Prayag, Raghuveer Sahai, Liladhar Jagudi, Manohar Shyam Joshi, Abdul Bismillah and Srilal Shukla Writers kept adding
 raajakmal prakaashan hindi sahitya jagat main ek saphaltam prakaashan santhaan ke rup main sthapit ho gaya
 Initially, people thought that with Sheela Sandhu being the managing director of Rajkamal, this publishing institute would be closed and Sandhu would start her family business motor parts shop here
 parantu apni karmthata evam drudh sankalpashiltaa se shila sandhu ne na keval yah ashanka dur kii, balki sumitranandan pant, bhagwati charan verma, harivansh raay bachchan, sooryakanth treepathi niraala, shivamangala singh suman, baba nagarjun or fanishwar nath renu kaa vishwaas bhi arjeet kiya or is prakaar raajakmal kii sthapit prasiddhi kaa vistaar kiya
 At that time there was no way of printing the books of Rajkamal Prakashan through electronic means
 shila sandhu hastlikhit pandulipiyaan sweekaar karti thim
 They were typed, then made proof in the letter press and then the author would give their recommendation on them
 lekhakon se pustakon ke mukhyansh, vigyaapan tathaa cover ke liye sampark kiya jaataa
 Authors were never discouraged from participating in the process of publishing their book
 bhartiya prakaashak sangh kii baithkon main shila sandhu ne apane bhar yah siddh karne kaa praytn bhi kiya ki lekhakon ke roylty khaaton ko paardarshee banaakar unke saath pragadh sambandh banaaya ja saktaa he
 However, the idea did not become popular among publishers
 us samay raajakmal prakaashan kii pustaken computer main nahin rahati thi or jab chaahe tab utani hi pratiyaan chhapakar bech lene jaisi koi baat nahin thi
 The book was kept safe in the miles long shelves of the mercenaries, printed in the ream ream papers

 In today's age these things may seem ridiculous but for the time it is true

 Mohan Gupta, who came from Kolkata, gradually took over the work of editing and then he took up all the responsibilities related to editing, publishing and printing the book
 swayan shila sandhu unhen 'hindi prakaashan jagat ke sarvshereshth sampadak va prakaashan prabandhakon main ek' maanati hai
 After successful operation of this publishing institute for 30 years, Sheela Sandhu broke away from it and in 1994 Ashok Maheshwari took over the post of Managing Director
 unke sanchaalan main vartmaan samay tak raajakmal prakaashan hindi sahitya jagat main sarvshereshth prakaashan sanstha ke rup main vikaas path par agrasar he
 It is important that the value of books is not as balanced as before
 is betahasha moolyavriddhi ke atirikt bhi yadi koi antar aayaa he to vah yah he ki is prakaashan ke aarambhik samay main hi duuradrushti vaale sarjanaatmak evam dussahas kii had tak jane vaale omprakash ji ne 'raajakmal prakaashan par utkrisht gunvattta kii amit chhap chodi' jo prakashit pustakon kii rachanaatmakataa ke rup main to aaj bhi barkaraar he, parantu dher sari pustakon main prayukt kiye jane vaale atyant starhin kaagajon ke kaaran is kshetra kii gunvattta kaaphi had tak dhwast ho gayi he
 In a short time, this thick, very light paper, which reaches several times worse than newsprint, is constantly discounting the pride of Rajkamal
 raajakmal prakaashan ne shreshth lekhakon kii sampoorn rachanaaon ko krambaddh tathaa pramanik rup main uplabdh karaane hetu suyogy sampadakon ke dwaara unki rachanawali prakashit karne kii anuthi pahal kii
 Its first episode as a plan was Hazariprasad Dwivedi's Rachnavali, which was being edited by his son Mukund Dwivedi
 haalanki yah rachanawali kaaphi baad main prakashit ho paayi
 The first to be published was Rachnavali Sumitranandan Pant Rachnavali, for which Rajkamal Prakashan at that time had a happy coincidence of receiving pre-order and advance amount of pre-publication from the readers
 iske baad to anek shreshth lekhon kii rachanawaliyaan atyant utkrisht rup main prastut karke raajakmal ne is kshetra main kirtiman sthapit kar diya he
 Details of the creations published from here are visible in the following table
 saamaanya pathakon ke liye hindi sahitya kii pahunch ke kshetra main pustakon ke paperbaque sanskaran ke rup main mul pustak kii yathaavat prastuti kii pahal karke raajakmal ne ek tarah se pathakeey kranti utpann kar di
 Initially many people expressed doubts over the success of Paperbacks, fearing lack of literary interest in the readers
 parantu, jab muktibodh rachanawali kaa dwitiya sanskaran paperbax ke rup main bhi aayaa or prakaashan se purv hi uskaa teen chauthai hissaa bik gaya to isaki nihsandigdh safalataa akatya rup se pramanit ho gayi
 This paperback edition greatly increased the readership of serious literature and this experiment has now taken the form of an imperative with complete success

 One is their price is low, the second is doubled by giving pictures of famous artists' artworks on its cover
 iskaa aarambh bhi shila sandhu ne apni dwitiya putree ke sahyog se kiya tha
 Through Rajkamal Prakashan, two magazines such as 'criticism' and 'nayi Kahaniyan', which were able to secure a definite place in the history of Hindi literature, were also published
 'aalochana' kaa prakaashan multah aalochana kendrit ek tremasik saahitiyik patrika ke rup main oktober 1951 main aarambh hua tha
 Its founder editor was Shivdan Singh Chauhan
 kuch varshon tak iskaa sampadan ek sampadak mandal ke dwaara hua phir nandadulaare vaajapeyi iske sampadan se jude or sabase lambey samay tak namvar singh ke sampadan main yah patrika nikalati rahi
 After its publication was suspended in the last decade of the twentieth century, its publication started again in a new form from 2000 AD
 'nayi kahaniyaan' multah kahani-kendrit patrika thi
 The idea of its publication was that of Omprakash, the then managing director of Rajkamal Publications
 unhone apane prayatnon se is patrika ke prakaashan ke liye bhairav prasad gupt ko janvari 1960 main hi sampadak ke rup main niyukt kiya tathaa chaar maheene kii taiyaari ke baad may 1960 main iskaa praveshank aayaa
 Due to Bhairav prasad Gupta being in Allahabad, its publication started from Allahabad, but later it started being published from Delhi itself and Bhairav prasad Gupta also came to Delhi
 bhairav prasad gupt ne janvari 1963 tak 'nayi kahaniyaan' kaa sampadan kiya tathaa rachanaatmak shreshthata evam lokapriyata donon drushtiyon se use uplabdhi ke shikhar tak pahunchaaya
 The entry number of 'new Stories' was ten thousand copies and the second issue was printed twenty five thousand copies
 chathe ank tak main hi isaki prasar-sankhya pichahattar hajaar tak pahunch gayi thi
 After the departure of Bhairav prasad Gupta from editing 'nayi Kahaniyaan', it was published without an editor from February 1963 to April 63
 may 1963 ke 'varshganth visheshank' kaa sampadan mannu bhandari ne kiya
 From June 1963, Kamleshwar edited it
 disambar 63 evam janvari 64 ke 2 ankon ke rup main 'prem katha visheshank'-1 evam 2 kaa prakaashan hua
 The October 1964 editorial was titled 'phantom speaks'
 yah sampadakeey 'akahani' ke viruddh likhaa gaya tha
 Kamleshwar edited 'nayi Kahaniyan' till July 1965
 agast 1965 main namvar singh ke praytn se bhishma saahani ne nayi kahaniyaan kaa sampadan-bhaar sanbhaala or kareeb dhai varsh tak unhone iskaa sampadan kiya
 Rajkamal Prakashan had branches in many cities for a long time, but gradually it only had its own branch in Patna, Bihar and branches of other cities were closed
 vartmaan samay main bhi isaki patna shakha vikray kaa kirtiman sthapit karte hue science college ke saamne, ashok rajpath, patna-6 main vidyaman he
 After separation from Rajkamal publishing group Rajkamal, Omprakash ji founded 'radhakrishna Prakashan'
 unke baad arvind kumaar uske prabandh nideshak hue or unke baad ashok maheshwari ne is daayitv ko sanbhaala
 Later, when Ashok Maheshwari got the responsibility of Rajkamal publication, the sources of these two important publications naturally got interlinked
 isi prakaar ek samay raajakmal kii elahabaad shakha ko band karne kaa nirnay lene par uske taatkaalik prabharee dinesh ji dwaara usee sthaan par sthapit lokbharati prakaashan bhi san 2005 main aapasi samjhaute ke tahat raajakmal se jud gaya or is prakaar 'raajakmal prakaashan samooh' kaa nirmaan hua
 These three publications are also independent in their own right and are related to each other under mutual agreement
 is prakaar hindi sahitya jagat ke sabase bade prakaashan santhaan ke rup main yah samooh gatisheel he
 'BANYAN TREE BOOKS' has also been added to this group
 saath hi isamen raajakmal prakaashan kaa upkram 'sarthak' evam radhakrishna kaa upkram 'funda' bhi shaamil he
 This publication group publishes around four hundred books per year, including a large number of reprintings of previously published books with new publications

 There are some countries like China in which the districts are called something else in the local language, but in English-translation, they are called counties
 china main zilon kaa chini naam 'shian' he lekin inhen angrezi main 'county' kehete hai
 The word "county" comes from the old French language word "conté", which means an area that is in possession of a Wycount
