 jeevanikar david bakale likhte hai, ki "yadi zigi ne apane nirmaataa or darshakon donon ko bhramit kiya tha, to is bhram kaa ek bada kaaran kaamuktha ke mudde par kendrit tha
 "in an interview with Melody Maker in January 1972, Bowie declared himself bisexual, a move that came with early pictures of his promotion to stardom as Ziggy Stardust
 plaboy ke saath sitambar 1976 ke ek saakshaatkaar main bovi ne kaha: "yah sahi he — main ubhayalingi hum
 lekin main is baat ko nakaar nahin saktaa ki maine is tathy kaa prayog bahut acchhee tarah kiya he
 i believe this was the best thing that happened to me
 " In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie stated that the public declaration of bisexuality was "the biggest mistake i made" and that on another occasion he stated that his interest in gay and bisexual culture was the result of those periods and situations, In which he found himself more than his feelings; As biographer Buckley describes, he stated that he was driven by the "compulsion to disobey moral rules rather than actual biological and psychological existence
" 2002 main jab blendar ne unase poocha ki kya ve ab bhi yah maanate the ki unki saarvajanik ghoshnaa unke dwaara kii gai sabase badi galati thi, to unhone jawaab diya: Buckley's view of the period is that Bowie, "taboos and pallbearers 


 exploded into sexual intrigue for its ability to be startled", and "probably true that Bowie was ever gay Were not, nor were regularly, actively bisexual
 

 samay-samay par unhone prayog kiye, chaahe aisa keval jigyaasa kii bhaavana or “ulanghan-parak ” ke saath unki vishuddh nishtha ke kaaran hi kyon na ho
 "according to biographer Christopher Sandford, Mary Finningen, with whom Bowen had a love affair in 1969, the singer and his first wife Angie" lived in a fictional world and continued to create their bisexual fantasies
 " sandford bataate hai ki is vivaah ke dauraan kis tarah bovi ne “us chutkule ko dohraane ko ek sakaaratmak kamottejak vastu bana diya tha ki ve or unki patni ‘ek hi vyakti ke saath yon-krida karte samay’ mili the samalangik yon-kriya sadaiv hi ek kaalpanik or parihaaspurn mudda tha
 Bowie's real interest was in contrast, this is also evident by a partial comparison of his love affairs with women
 " a man with the ability to sing in multiple vocals, Bowie used a wide variety of musical styles since his earliest recordings in the 1960s
 unki shuruaati rachanaaon or pradarshan par na keval little richard or elvis presli jaise rock and role kalakaaron kaa atyadhik prabhaav tha, balki ve sho bijnes ke vyapak vishwa se bhi prabhavit the
 He typically tried to sing like the British musical theater singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose singing style he often adopted, and used it prominently for his first release in 1967, David Bowie

 But while presenting them they continue to change from person to person, their voice changes dramatically from one part to another
 " Bowie plays a number of instruments, including electric, acoustic and twelve-stringed guitars, alto, high-pitched and medium-vowel sexophones, pianos, keyboards including synthesizers and melotrons, harmonica, stylophones, xylophones, vibraphones, Coto, drums and rhythms are included
 bovi ke rachanaatmak geeton or manch-kala ne 1970 ke dashak ke prarambh main lokapriy sangeet ko ek naye pratimaan par pahunchaaya or apane nearesth roopon or bhavi vikaas ko bahut prabhavit kiya
 According to music historians Shinder and Schwartz, Glam Rock promoter Bowie is jointly responsible for the creation of this genre
 usee samay, unhone pank rock sangeet andolan ke avishkaarakon ko bhi prerit kiya—itihaas-visheshgy maaikel campbell unhen “pank ke praarambhik prabhaavon main se ek” qaraar dete hai
 While punk musicians were breaking the traditions of pop stardom, Bowie moved forward — in a more concise style of music production that would go on to become a transforming influence
 jeevanikar david bakale likhte hai, "ek aise samay, jab pank rock saarvajanik apmaan ke ek pradarshan main teen-minute ke ek geet par shor-purna rup se punah daawa kar rahaa tha, to bovi ne lagbhag puri tarah paaramparik rock vaadya-sangeet vinyas ko tyaag diya

 "attempted to convey his unique status in popular music by raising the slogan of" 

 musician James Perrone credits him with "bringing a refinement to rock music" and critical reviews often acknowledge the intellectual depth of his work and its impact
 Huh
 bakale likhte hai ki 1970 ke praarambhik dashak ke pop vishwa, jo ki “dhabbedaar, swa-mahatvapurn, chamade se aachhadit, aatm-santusht tha, main bovi ne apane samay ke rock sangeet ke mul vishwaas ko hi chunauti di
" jaisaa ki jon pil ne varnan kiya he, "1970 ke dashak ke praarambhik kaal ke vikasvaadi rock ke bare main ek pramukh lakshan yah he ki iskaa vikaas nahin hua
 Before Bowie's arrival, people did not want to change too much
 " bakale kehete hai ki bovi ne “is puri dharna ko hi ulat diya”, jiskaa pariman yah hua ki “bovi ke baad unke str kaa koi bhi anya pop iken nahin hua he kyonki rock sangeet ke aise devataaon kaa nirmaan karne vaale pop vishwa kaa astitv hi ab samaapt ho chukaa he
 Bowie's strong support for the denomination was also unique — its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than any other force within the pop supporter group
 " bakale kaa nishkarsh he ki "bovi ek star or iken donon hai
 The wide expanse of work he created has created possibly the largest sect of popular culture
 lokapriy samskruti main unka prabhaav adwitiya rahaa he—unhone kisi bhi anya tulaneey vyaktitv kii apeksha adhik logon ke jivan main paith banaai he or unhen parivartit kiya he

 jeevanikar thomas forgat likhte hai ki, "chunki ve sangeet kii itani sari bhinn-bhinn shaileyon main safal hue the, atah aaj aisa koi lokapriy kalakaar dhund paanaa lagbhag asambhav he, jo david bovi se prabhavit na rahaa ho

 Albinism occurs as a result of inheriting recessive gene alleles and affects all vertebrates, including humans
 elbinizam se prabhavit jeevadhariyon ke liye sabase aam taur par istemaal kiya jane vaala shabd "rajakahin jeev " he
 The terms "albinoid" and "albinic" are sometimes used to refer to animals under additional clinical adjectives

 There are two main categories of albinism in humans: anya dashaon main unke rang-rup ke hisse ke rup main elbinizam shaamil he
 These include hermansky-pudlak syndrome, chediak-higashi syndrome, Griselli syndrome, Wardenburg syndrome, and Teitz syndrome
 in dashaon ko kabhi-kabhi elbinizam ke saath vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Many have subtypes
 kuch ko unke rang-rup se aasaani se pahchaan liya jaataa he, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main anuvanshik pareekshan hi sateek pahchaan karne kaa ekmaatr tarika hota he
 Albinism was previously classified as tyrosinase-positive or -negative
 tyrosiness-positive elbinizam ke maamalon main anzime tyrosiness maujuud hota he
 Melanocyte is unable to produce melanin for any of a variety of reasons, which does not directly involve the tyrosinase enzyme
 tyrosiness-negative se sambandhit maamalon main yaa to tyrosiness anzime kaa nirmaan nahin hota he yaa iske gaiyr-kriyasheel rup kaa nirmaan hota he
 This classification has become obsolete in recent research
 zyaadaatar ranjakahin manushya safed yaa bilkul pile dikhaai dete hai kyonki unamem bhure, kaale or kuch pile rangon ke liye jimmedaar melanin ranjak maujuud nahin hote hai
 Since the skin of people with albinism is partially or completely lacking the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun's ultraviolet radiation, their skin is larger when exposed to excessive sun rays
 Can burn easily
 maanav aankh main aam taur par iris ko rang pradaan karne ke liye paryaapt ranjak kaa nirmaan hota he or aankh ko apaardarshita praapt hoti he
 However, there are some cases where the eyes of an albinistic person appear red or purple, depending on the magnitude of the dye present in them
 aankhon main ranjak yaa varnak ke abhaav ke parinamswaroop photocencetivity se sambandhit or asambandhit drushti sambandhi samasyaayein bhi paidaa hone lagati hai
 Albinistic organisms are generally healthy like other organisms and have normal growth and developmental functions and do not result in death from albinism itself, although lack of dyes increases the risk of skin cancer and other problems is

 This disordered RPE results in foveal hypoplasia, resulting in exantric fixation and reduced visual acuity and often a smaller level of strabismus
 iris ranjak utak se bana ek sphinctor he jo putali se hokar guzarane vaali prakaash kii maatra ko simit karke retina kii raksha karne ke liye, ujjwal prakaash ke sampark main aankh ke aane par sikud jaataa he

 Additionally, improper development of the RPE that absorbs most of the reflected sunlight in normal eyes further increases brightness due to the diffraction of light within the eye

 elbinizangrast yaa elbinizamarahit kisi jeevadharee kii jodi se elbinizangrast santan kii utpatti kii sambhaavna kam hoti he
 However, since organisms can be gene carriers for albinism without exhibiting any symptoms, albinistic progeny may be produced by nonalbinistic parents
 elbinizam aamtaur par donon lingon main samaan aavriti ke saath hoti he
 An exception to this is ocular albinism, which migrates to offspring via X-linked inheritance
 is prakaar, ocular elbinizam zyaadaatar purushon main hota he kyonki keval ek-ek x or y chromosome hota he jabaki mahilaon main do x chromosome hote hai
 There are two different forms of albinism ; Partial absence of melanin is known as hypomelanism or hypomelanosis, and complete absence of melanin is known as amelanism or amelanosis

 Symptoms of albinism can be treated through various methods described in detail below
 aankh sambandhi samasyaon ke ilaaj main zyaadaatar drishy punarvaas shaamil hota he
 It is possible to perform surgery on the ocular muscles to reduce nystagmus, strabismus, and common refractive errors such as astigmatism
 strobismus surgery se aankhon ke rup-rang main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he

 in sabhi prakriyaaon kii prabhavakaarita main kaaphi antar hota he or vah vyaktigat paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he
 More importantly, since surgery cannot restore any normal RPE or fovia, better binocular vision may not be achieved by surgery
 esotropia ke maamle main surgery dwaara drishy kshetra kaa vistaar karke drushti main madad mil sakati he
 Eyeglasses and other vision aids, large print materials and CCTV, as well as bright but oblique reading lights can help people with albinism, although their vision may not be fully recovered
 kuch elbinizam grast log bifocal, prescripshan reeding glass or / yaa haath se pakadakar istemaal kiye jane vaale upkarnon jaise magnephaire yaa monocular kaa istemaal karnaa acchhee tarah dekh sakate hai
 Contact lenses can be colored to block the transmission of light through the iris
 lekin nistegamas ke maamle main aankhon ke hilne-dulne kii vajah se hone vaali jalan kii vajah se aisa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Some use glasses called bioptics where small telescopes are mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses so that they can be seen either through a regular lens or through a telescope
 Smaller and lighter lenses are used in new bioptics designs
 kuch america rajyon main motor vaahanon ko chalaane ke liye bioptic telescopon ke istemaal kii anumati he
 Despite being still a subject of controversy among experts, many ophthalmologists recommend using glasses since early childhood for the best possible development of the eyes

 Different cultures have developed beliefs about people with albinism in cultures around the world
 is loksahitya main hanirahit myth se lekar khatarnaak andhvishwaas bhi shaamil he, jo maanav jivan ko prabhavit karte hai
 Cultural challenges can be expected mostly in areas where the number of people with pale skin and light hair exceeds the average phenotype of ethnic majority
 africa deshon jaise tanzania or burundi main haal ke varshon main elabino logon ko jaadu-tone se sambandhit hatyaon main abhootpurv vruddhi dekhi gai he
 The reason for this is that the body parts of albinos are used in the medicines sold by the sorcerers

 Albinistic birds and reptiles, in particular, may have red and yellow or other colors present on their entire body or in the form of spots, as the presence of other pigments is unaffected by albinism, such as profirins, teridins, and sitiens

 The following sequence of numbers in mathematics is called Hemachandra series or Fibonacci series: paribhaasha ke anusaar, pehali do hemchandra sankhyaayein 0 or 1 hai
 Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers
 kuch log aarambhik 0 ko chhod dete hai, jisaki jagah do 1 ke saath anukram kii shuruuaat kii jaati he
 In mathematical terms, the f n sequence of Fibonacci numbers can be represented by the rotation relation- tathaa, The Fibonacci sequence is named after Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa, who was known as Fibonacci
 fibonachi dwaara likhit 1202 kii pustak liber abek ne pashchim europea ganit main is anukram ko pravartit kiya, haalanki pehle hi bhartiya ganit main is anukram kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 The Fibonacci sequence was very well known in ancient India, where it was applied to versification science long before it became prevalent in Europe
 iske vikaas kaa shrey pingala, virahanka, gopal, tathaa hemchandra ko diya jaataa he
 The Fibonacci sequence is prepared by adding s to a sample of n - 1 length, or by adding l to a sample of n - 2 length; And the scribes showed that samples of n length are the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence
 donald nuth ne da art of computer programing main is kaary kii samiksha kii he
 In the west, Leonardo of Pisa studied this sequence known as Fibonacci in his Liber Abaci
 unhone ek adarsh khargosh kii aabaadi ke vikaas par yah maanate hue vichaar kiya ki: Its rule is that one pair of rabbits produces 2 pairs in its lifetime and dies
 maan len ki n maheene main aabaadi f he
 At this time, only those rabbits, which survived at n - 2 months, are fertile and produce offspring, so f pairs are added to the existing population F
 is prakaar kul he f = f + f 
 The first 21 Fibonacci numbers also reported as Fn for n = 0, 1, 2, 


, 20 are: aavartan sambandh kaa prayog karte hue, anukram rinatmak suchakank n tak bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he

is prakaar fibonachi anukram, ek vibhajyata anukram kaa udhaaharan he
 darasal, fibonachi anukram suspasht vibhajyata gun ko santusht karata he
 Like every sequence defined by linear rotation, the Fibonacci number has a whole-formula solution
 It is known as the Binet Sutra, although he was previously known as Abraham de Moivre: 
 Fibonacci Repatriation svarnim anupaat ke nirdharak sameekaran ke samaan nimnatah he Which is known as the productive polynomial of alternation
 uparyukt sameekaran kaa koi mul x 2 = x + 1, { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}x^{2}=x+1, \ end{matrix}} \ ,} kaa samaadhaan karata he or x n − 1 { \ displaystyle x^{n-1} \ ,} dwaara guna karne se nimna darshata he: By definition φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi \ ,}, is the root of the equation and the second root is 1 - φ = - 1 / φ
 { \ displaystyle 1- \ varphi \ , = - 1 / \ varphi \ ,
}
 So: or Both φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n = n { \ displaystyle ^ {n} = ^ {n}} are geometric series that solve the Fibonacci alternation
 The first series expands exponentially; The second, exponentially, with alternating signs, leads to zero
 Since the Fibonacci alternation is linear, any linear combination of these two series can also solve the alternation
 These linear combinations create a two-dimensional linear vector difference; The original Fibonacci sequence can be found in this difference
 raikhik sanyojanon kii shrinkhlaayein φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^{n}} or n { \ displaystyle ^{n}}, a tathaa b gunankon sahit, nimna dwaara paribhaashit kii ja sakati hai All the series defined in this way satisfy the Fibonacci alternation
 jahaan apeksha he ki f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=0} or f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_{a,b}=1} pratifal a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a=1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} or b = − 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle b=-1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} dete hai, jiske parinamswaroop vahi binet sutara miltaa he, jisase hamane shuru kiya tha
 yah darshaya gaya he ki yah sutara fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karata he
 iske alaava, ek suspasht jaanch kii ja sakati he: And aagaman ke mul prashnon siddh karte hue, pramanit karte hai ki Therefore, for any two initial values, the combination a, b { \ displaystyle a, b} can be found such that the functions f a, b { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} \ ,}, are accurate to the sequence
 Complete formula
 chunki sabhi n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} ke liye | 1 − φ | n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k>=0} purnankon ke liye paaya jaataa he opposite of this, kabhi-kabhi vyutkram fibonachi sankhya par purnank yogafal kaa theta falan ke sandarbh main maan nikaala ja saktaa he
 udhaaharan ke liye, ham har visham-ghaataanki fibonachi sankhya ke yoga ko nimnatah likh sakate hai And the sum of the square inverse Fibonacci numbers as follows agar ham pehle yoga main prayek fibonachi sankhya ke saath 1 jod den, to vahaan bhi purna sutara hoga And is a well-graded sum of square Fibonacci numbers, which gives the inverse of the golden ratio, is tarah ke parinaam dekhne main sahi prathit hote hai ki vyutkram fibonachi sankhya ke saadhaaran yoga ke liye ek purna sutara paaya ja saktaa he, lekin abhi tak aisa koi gyaat nahin hua he
 uske baavjood, vyutkram fibonachi sthiraank Has been proved irrational by Richard andré-jianin
 fibonachi abhajya sankhya, ek aisi fibonachi sankhya he, jo abhajya he
 pehle kuch hai: Fibonacci prime numbers have been found with thousands of digits, but it is not known if there are many infinite numbers
 They all must have a prime exponent, except f 4 = 3
 f kn ko f n se vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or isliye manamaane dhang se kai sanyukt sankhya prachlan main hone ke kaaran, sanyukt fibonachi sankhya bhi manamaane dhang se prachlan main hai
 Each Fibonacci number with the exception of 1, 8 and 144 has a prime multiplier, which is not a multiple of a smaller Fibonacci number
 keval 144 nagnetar varg fibonachi sankhya he

 iske alaava, agar p ≠ 5 ek visham abhajya sankhya he, to: Examples of all cases: visham n ke liye, f n ke sabhi visham abhajya bhaajak hai ≡ 1, jo yah suchit karte hai ki f n ke sabhi visham bhaajak hai ≡ 1 
 for example, f 1 = 1, f 3 = 2, f 5 = 5, f 7 = 13, f 9 = 34 = 2×17, f 11 = 89, f 13 = 233, f 15 = 610 = 2×5×61 ∑ k = nn + 9 f k = 11 f n + 6 { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = n} ^ {n + 9} F_ {k} = 11F_ {n + 6}} udhaaharan ke liye, let n = 1: f 1 + f 2 + 


 + f 10 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 = 143 = 11 × 13n = 2: F2 + F3 + 


 + F11 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 = 231 = 11 × 21n = 3: F3 + F4 + 


 + F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144 = 374 = 11 × 34 vastutah, samaanika na keval dhanatmak, balki sabhi n purnankon ke liye sahi he: n = 0: F0+F1+


+F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11×8n = −1: f − 1 + F0 + 


 + F8 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 = 55 = 11 × 5n = −2: F−2+F−1+F0+


+F7 = −1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 33 = 11×3 It can be easily seen that if the units of the Fibonacci sequence take mod n, then the resulting sequence with at most n 2 rotations must be iterative
 Various n formulas, the extension of frequencies for the so-called Pisano rotation
 The determination of Pisano frequencies in general is an open problem, although for a particular n it can be solved as an example of cycle detection

 The sides of the first triangle in this sequence are 5, 4 and 3 in length
 Leaving 8, the sides of the next triangle are 13, 12 and 5 in length
 Leaving 21, the sides of the next triangle are 34, 30 and 16 in length
 This sequence continues indefinitely
 The sides of the triangle a, b, c can be calculated directly: ye sutara sabhi n ke liye a n 2 = b n 2 + c n 2 { \ displaystyle a_{n}^{2}=b_{n}^{2}+c_{n}^{2}} ko hal karte hai, lekin ve keval trikon kii bhujaaon kaa nirupan karte hai, jab n > 2 { \ displaystyle n>2} ho
 To generate the Pathagorean triplets in a different way, any four consecutive Fibonacci numbers f n, f n +1, f n +2 and f n +3 can also be used
 udhaaharan 1: maan len fibonachi sankhyaayein 1, 2, 3 or 5 hai

 Each positive integer can be written in such a unique way as the sum of one or more distinct Fibonacci numbers, that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers
 This is known as the Zekendorf theorem and the sum of the Fibonacci numbers that satisfy these rules is called the Zeckendorf representation

 In music, Fibonacci numbers are sometimes used to determine the harmonics and, like visual art, are used to determine the length or size of the material or elements needed
 It is generally believed that the first rhythms of Bella Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta were structured using Fibonacci numbers

 The Fibonacci sequences, in two successive Fibonacci numbers, appear in biological scenes, such as branches in trees, arrangement of leaves on the stalk, pineapple pods, a folded fern artichoke flower, and arrangement of cedar cones
 In addition, many popular sources of nature claim claims related to Fibonacci numbers or gold segments, such as breeding of rabbits, spiral circles of mussels and the curve of waves
 Fibonacci numbers are also found in the bee family tree

 Fibonacci numbers also appear in the reproduction description of a population of ideally spotted bees, according to the following rules: is prakaar, nar makkhi ke hameshaa ek janak honge or maadaa makkhi ke do
 If one discovers the evolution of the offspring of a male bee, then it will have 1 female parent
 a female will have 2 parents, a female and a male
 The female will have two parents, one male and one female and one male female
 Those two females each had two parents and one male
 This sequence of numbers of parents is a Fibonacci sequence

 It is located near National Highway 75 in Panna district
 saraswatikanthabharan, kavyatatv kaa vivechan karanevaala sanskrit-sahitya-shaastra kaa ek mananeey granth he jisaki rachana dhareshwar ke maharaj bhojraj ne kii
 The time of Maharaja Bhojraj has been accepted by historians from 1010-1055 AD
 atev saraswatikanthabharan kaa rachanakaal isvi gyarahavin shatabdi kaa madhya mana ja saktaa he
 Its pioneer is somewhat predecessor to Mammatt, the author of Kaviprakash
 yadhyapi aanandavardhan dwaara dhvanisiddhant kii sthapana ho chuki thi tathaapi us samay tak kaavyatma ke rup main dhwani kii manyata vivadagrast si hi thi ; atev saakshaat rup se dhwani ko kavy kii paribhaasha main aatma ke rup main sthaan dene kii dridhtaa na bhojdev ne hi apanaai or na bhatta mammat ne hi
 Both acharyas have given importance to doshava and quality in poetry
 bhojdev kii yah visheshta he ki unhone alankaaron kii upadayeta kanthat: sweekaar kii he tathaa kavy ke liye rasanvit hona aavashyak samajha he
 Thus, Bhojdev's Saraswati Kantha Bharan has influenced Mammat and Vishwanath in part
 saraswatikanthabharan ek dirghakaay granth he jisamen paanch pariched hai
 In the first passage, after giving the definition of poetry general, the author has first discussed the long and virtue of poetry
 isi sandarbh main bhojdev ne pad, vaakya evam vaakyarthgat dosha bataae hai
 The number of defects of each type is sixteen
 bhojdev ke anusaar gun, shabdagat or vaakyarth gat hote hai or prayek ke choubees bhed hai
 At the end of the first passage, certain defects become attributes somewhere
 is kavyatatv ko udhaaharan dwaara samajhaate hue unhone kavyadosha kaa nityanityatv sweekrut kiya he
 In the second passage, while deciding on the phraseology, he first emphasized justification and has given a thoughtful explanation of caste, ritual, attitude, shadow, posture, utterance, tact, bhuniti, hump, bed and readiness
 in baarah tatwon main se reeti ko chhod shesh tatwon kaa vishad vivechan sanskrit ke kisi anya uplabdh sahityagranth main praapt nahin hota
 Banabhatta mentions the bed of special poetic element, but its definition is available only in Saraswati Kantabharana
 tatpashchaat, yamak, shlesh, anupras, chitra, prahelika, gudh evam prashnottar alankaaron ke bhuri bhedopabhedon kaa sodaaharan vivaran diya gaya he
 This part also has the most personal feature of Saraswati Kantabharan
 tadnantar bhojdev kavyavyutpatti ke kaarnon kaa vivechan kar kavy ke teen bhedon ko shravy, drishy evam chitrabhinay ke rup main prastut karte hai
 He has not mentioned Darsuparchakas under visualization, but his division on dance and dance is limited
 tisare pariched main arthanlakaaron ke swaroop evam prakaar bhed kaa vivechan he jo itar saahityachaaryon kii apeksha bhinn swaroop ko liye hue he
 In the fourth passage, there is a discussion of bisexuality, in which the distinction of ornaments of upma etc
 is explained in detail
 antim pariched he - rasvivechan
 In it, the character of Naikadi and the expressions, emotions and experiences have been decided in detail; At the same time, there is also a reference to the form of Kavyapaka, the diverse nightlife
 ant main bharti, kaishiki aadi vrittiyon ke vivechan ke saath granthopasanhaar hota he
 Rasasiddhanta's explanation in Saraswati Kantabharana is often a bird's eye view of the subject
 kavyagat ras gambhir vishay he jisaki garima ke saath purnat: nyaay karne kii drushti se bhoj ne ek shringarprakash naamak swatantra granth kii rachana kar rasvivechan ke adhyay kii purti kii he
 The specialty of Saraswati Kantha Bharan is that it is a broader and derivative text than other literary texts
 iske rachayita bhojdev granthvistaar ke bhay se bhit honevaale nahin hai, udhaaharan de-dekar anek sookshm bhed evam upabhedon ko samajhane kaa sadaa ve udaar prayaas karte hai
 Although the recognition of the discrimination presented by them has not been accepted by the later writers, yet the persistence of disagreeing with their elemental deliberations is also not visible
 is granth par adyopant kisi tikaa kii rachana nahin milti
 On the first three passages, there is a vaccine called Ratneshwar Ramsinghrit Darpan Tika and on the fourth passage, the description of the famous commentator Jagadghar, is not the vaccine for the fifth passage
 yah granth nirnay sagar dwaara prakashit he
 It has not been translated yet
 saraswatikanthabharan main uddhrut udhaaharan shlokon kii suchi or unke rachayitaaon kii khoj kar ek suchi karnal jacob ne banaai he, jo india offis librori, landan main surakshit he
 Sri Paad Keshav Bharati was the guru of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the founder of the Gaudiya Vaishnava sect

 software ejineering main data modelling takneekon kaa prayog karke aupchaarik data model vivaranon ko lagu karte hue ek data model kaa nirmaan karne kii prakriya data modelling kehalaati he
 Data modeling is a method used to define and analyze the data requirements necessary to support an organization's business processes
 data aavashyaktaaon ko ek vaicharik data model se judi data paribhaashaon ke rup main record kiya jaataa he
 The actual implementation of a conceptual model is called a logical data model
implementation of ek vaicharik data model ke kriyanvayan ke liye anek taarkik data modelon kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Data modeling defines not only the elements of the data, but also their structures and the relationships between them
 data modelling takneekon or kaarividhiyon kaa prayog ek maanak, sthir, aakalneey rup main data ko chitrit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, taaki ek sansaadhan ke rup main iskaa prabandhan kiya ja sake
 un sabhi pariyojnaon ke liye data modelling maanakon ke prayog kii dridhtaapurvak anushansa kii gai he, jinamein kisi sanghathan ke aantarik data ko paribhaashit evam vishleshit karne ke liye ek maanak saadhan kii aavashyaktaa ho, udaa
 data modelling kaa prayog nimnlikhit kaaryon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he: Data modeling can be done in different types of projects and in many phases of projects
 data model pragatisheel hote hai; kisi bhi vyapaar yaa anuprayog ke liye koi bhi data model kabhi antim nahin hota
 isaki bajaay ek data model ko ek jivit dastavej mana janaa chaiye, jo badalte hue vyapaar kii pratikriya ke rup main badalegaa
 adarsh rup se, data model ko ek ripozitary main rakhaa janaa chaiye, taaki samay ke saath ise punah praapt kiya ja sake, vistaarit kiya ja sake or sampadit kiya ja sake
 whiton ne data modelling ke do prakaar nirdhaarit kiye: Data modeling is also a technique for describing business requirements for a database
 kabhi-kabhi ise database modelling kaha jaataa he kyonki ek data model ko antat ek database main kriyanvit kiya jaataa he
 Data models support data and computer systems by providing definition and formatting of data
 yadi pranaaliyon ke bich aisa lagaataar kiya jaye, to data kii sangatta praapt kii ja sakati he
 If the same data structures are used for storing and accessing data, different applications can share the data
 iske parinaam upar suchit kiye gayi hai
 However, the cost of building, running, and maintaining systems and interfaces is often much higher than it should be
 ve vyapaar kaa samarthan karne kii bajaay usamen baadha bhi utpann kar sakate hai
 One of the main reasons is that the data models implemented in systems and interfaces have low quality
 in samasyaon kaa kaaran ek aise maanak kaa abhaav he, jo yah sunishchit karegaa ki data model vyapaarik aavashyaktaaon kii purti bhi karenge or sangat bhi honge
 According to ANSI in 1975, an illustration of a data model can be of any one of three types: ANSI ke anusaar is vidhi kaa mahatv yah he ki yah teen drushtikonon ko ek duusare se saapeksh rup se swatantra rahane kii anumati detii he
 Storage technology can be changed without affecting logical or conceptual models
 talika / stambh sanrachana vaicharik model ko prabhavit kiye bina badal sakati he
 Naturally, in each case, the structures must remain compatible with other models
 The table / column structure may differ from direct translation of entity classes and attributes, but ultimately it must essentially serve the purposes of the conceptual entity class structure
 The initial stages of many software development projects emphasize the creation of a conceptual data model
 is prakaar ke ek dizine ko ek taarkik data model main varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 In later stages, this model can be transformed into a physical data model
 haalanki ek vaicharik data model ko sidhe hi lagu kar paanaa bhi sambhav he
 In the context of business process integration, see figure, data modeling will result in integration of database
 It complements business process modeling, which results in an application program that supports this business process
 vaastavik database dizine, database ke ek vistrut data model kaa nirmaan karne kii prakriya he
 This logical data model contains all of the logical and physical design selection and physical storage criteria required to construct the design into a data definition language, which can then be used to build a database
 sabhi visheshtaon se yukt ek data model main prayek ikai ke liye vistrut visheshtaayen hoti hai
 Database design terminology can be used to describe various parts of the design of a gross database system
 mukhyatah or sarvaadhik sahi rup main, ise data ke bhandaran ke liye prayukt mul data sanrachanaon kii ek taarkik rachana ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he
 a relational model consists of these tables and views
 ek object database main ikaiyaan or sambandh sidhe object claces or namit sambandhon se jude hote hai
 However, database design terminology can also be used to implement the aggregate process of designing, not only basic data structures, but also forms and queries used as part of a database management system or a gross database application in DBMS
 is
 is prakriya main system interphes par vartmaan system ke vikaas or samarthan laagat kaa 25% se 70% tak kharch aata he
 The main reason for this cost is that these systems do not use a common data model
 If data models are developed on a system-by-system basis, the same analysis is repeated not only in the covered regions, but it is also necessary to do further analysis to build interfaces between them
 adhikansh pranaaliyon main samaan buniyadi ghatak hote hai, jo kisi vishisht uddeshy ke liye punah viksit kiye jate hai
 For example, the same basic classification model as the following can be used as a component: unheen ghatakon ko punah viksit kiya jaataa he kyonki hamaare paas yah bataane kaa koi tarika nahin he ki ve samaan hai
 Data models represent information areas of interest
 haalanki, data modelon ke nirmaan kii anek vidhiyaan hai, lekin len silverstone ke anusaar inamen se keval do vidhiyaan hi shreshth hai, top-down or bottm-ap: Sometimes models are constructed as a mixture of these two methods: considering the structure and data requirements and structure of an application and giving a consistent reference to a subject-area model
 Unfortunately, in many environments, the difference between a logical data model and a physical data model is unclear
 iske atirikt, kuch CASE upkaran taarkik or bhautik data modelon ke bich antar nahin karte
 There are several signaling methods of data modeling
 vaastavik model ko aksar "ikai sambandh model " kaha jaataa he kyonki yah data ko isamen varnit ikaayiyon or unke sambandhon ke sandarbh main chitrit karata he
 An entity-relationship model is a brief conceptual display of structured data
 ikai-sambandh modelling ek sambandhaatmak skima database modelling vidhi he, jiskaa prayog software ejineering main kisi system, saamanytah ek sambandhaatmak database, ke ek prakaar ke vaicharik data model kaa nirmaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or isaki aavashyaktaaen ek top-down rup main hoti hai
 These models are used during the first phase of the creation of information systems to describe information requirements or the type of information that is to be placed in a database during requirements analysis
 data modelling takanic kaa prayog kisi vishisht samvaad-vishwa, arthath ruchi ke kshetra ke liye kisi bhi tathviki kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Several techniques have been developed to construct data models
 haalanki ye kaary-paddatiyaan data modelaron ko unke kaary main maargdarshan karatin hai, lekin samaan kaary-paddati kaa prayog karanevaale do bhinn log aksar do bhinn parinaamon ke saath saamne aaenge
 sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai: Common data models are generalizations of traditional data models
 ve manakikrut saamaanya sambandh prakaaron ko or saath hi vastuon ke un prakaaron ko paribhaashit karte hai, jo aise sambandh-prakaaron se judi ho sakati hai
 The definition of a general data model is very similar to the definition of a natural language
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek saamaanya data model sambandhit vastuon ke prakaaron se nirpeksh rahete hue sambandhon ke prakaaron ko ek 'vargeekaran sambandh', jo ki kisi ekal vastu or vastuon ke ek prakaar ke bich ek dwiadhari sambandh hota he or ek 'ansh-purna sambandh', jo ki do vastuon ke bich ek dwiadhari sambandh hota he, jinamein se ek vastu ansh kii bhoomika main or duusari purna kii bhoomika main hoti he, ke rup main paribhaashit kar saktaa he
 a canonical list of categories allows classification of a single object and specifying part-whole relationships for a single object
 sambandhon ke prakaaron kii ek vitanya suchi ke maanakeekaran ke dwaara, ek saamaanya data model tathyon ke prakaaron kii aseemit sankhya ko vyakt kar paane kii kshamta pradaan karata he or yah prakritik bhashaaon kii kshamtaaon kaa prayog karegaa
 duusari ore, paaramparik data modelon kaa domen dayera nishchit or simit hota he kyonki aise modelon kii sthapana keval us prakaar ke tathyon kii vyakhya karne kii anumati detii he, jo model main purv-paribhaashit hon
 The logical data structure of a DBMS, whether it is hierarchical, networked, or relational, cannot fully meet the needs of a conceptual definition of data because it is limited in scope and it is part of the implementation strategy used by that DBMS
 Is bent
 atah ek vaicharik drushtikon se data ko paribhaashit karne kii aavashyaktaa ke parinamswaroop arth-vigyaan data modelling takneekon ke vikaas hua he
 Namely, techniques for defining the meaning of data in terms of mutual relations with other data
 As shown in the figure, real-world is defined as physical data stores in the form of signals in terms of resources, ideas, events, etc
 ek arth-vigyaan data model ek sankshepan he, jo paribhaashit karata he ki ye chinh vaastavik-vishwa se kis prakaar jude hue hai
 Thus, this model must be a true real-world demonstration
 ek arth-vigyaan data model kaa prayog anek uddeshyon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jaise: The overall goal of the semantic data model is to capture more data by integrating relational concepts with powerful summarization concepts known from the field of artificial intelligence
 yahaan vichaar ucch stareey modelling ke puraatan tatwon ko data model ke ek abhinn ang ke rup main pradaan karnaa he, taaki vaastavik-vishwa kii sthitiyon ke pradarshan main sahaayta kii ja sake

 Developed from Muay Boron, Muay Thai is the national sport of Thailand
 shabd may kii vyutpatti sanskrit ke shabd mavy se or thai shabd kii vyutpatti shabd tai se hui he
 Muay Thai is known as the "art of the eight limbs" or "the science of the eight limbs" because it is hit by punch, kick, elbow and knee, thus using the "eight points of contact"
 In contrast, "two dots" are used in western boxing and "four dots" in sports-oriented martial arts
 may thai main prectis karne vaale peshewar ko naak may ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Western professionals are called nasal mu farang ie foreign boxer

 Based on a combination of Chinese and Indian martial arts, professionals claim that the art is two thousand years old
 thailand main may thai kaa vikaas may boron se hua, yah bina hathiyaaron ke mukkebaaji kaa ek prakaar he jiskaa upyog sambhavatya syameez sainikon ke dwaara tab kiya jaataa tha jab ve yuddh main apane hathiyaar khokar nihathe rah jate the
 Some believe that the ancient Siamese army created Muay Boron from the weapon-based art of Krabi Krabong, but some believe that the two styles probably evolved simultaneously
 phir bhi krabi crabong ne may boron or may thai ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya he, yah prabhaav vaai khru main kai kicks, holds or gatiyon main dekha ja saktaa he jinka vikaas sashastr sangharsh main hua
 Muay Boron and hence Muay Thai were originally called Toi Muay or just Muay

 These contestants of Muay gradually became an integral part of local festivals and festivals, especially those that were held in temples
 yahaan tak ki iskaa upyog raajaaon ke manoranjan ke liye bhi jaataa tha
 Previously, nothing was worn on the palms during this game, eventually the warriors began to wear a hemp rope wrapped on the front of their hands and arms
 is prakaar ke match ko may khaat chuek kaha jaataa tha
 May gradually became a possible means of personal advancement, as the honor of professionals of this art increased, selected professionals were invited to live in royal palaces, personal to members of the royal family, soldiers, princes or kings
 Started teaching this art to patrons
 is 'shahi may" ko may luaang kaha jaataa tha
 Sometimes during the Ayutthaya period, a platoon of these royal patrons was appointed, these patrons were appointed to protect the king and the country
 inhen krom naak may ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 This royal patronage of Kick May continued even during the reigns of Rama v and VII
 1868 main jab raja chulalongcorn singhaasana par baithe, yah kaal naa keval may ke liye balki puure thailand desh ke liye sunaharaa yug ban gaya
 During the reign of Rama V, there was a lot of growth of Maya, as the king himself took a direct personal interest in this art
 desh shanti kii sthiti main tha or may ne shaareerik vyaayaam, aatm-raksha, manoranjan or vyaktigat unnati ke ek saadhan ke rup main kaam kiya
 People who specializes in this art started teaching this art in training camps, here students were also provided food and shelter
 prashikshakon ko ek parivaar mana jaataa tha or vidhyaarthiyon ke dwaara shivi ke naam ko apane upnaam ke rup main apnaanaa ek pratha ban gayi thi
 Scouts were sent by the royal families to organize matches between the various camps
 raja ram VII ne may thai ke liye samhitabaddh niyam nirdhaarit kiye or inhen lagu kiya gaya
 Eland's first boxing ring was built in 1921 by Suan Kularp

 This was the time when the use of the word Muay Thai became very prevalent, while the older form of this style was known as Muay Boran
 mishrit marshall art main may thai kii safalataa ke saath, yah pratispardhi stand-ap pratiyogiyon ke liye chunaav kii di phecto style ban gaya
 As a result, Western professionals incorporated more powerful hand strike techniques than boxing, although some Thai professionals allege that these techniques make the art weaker
 may boron se sambandhit sabase prachlit lokkatha he nai khanomathome kii katha
 At the time of the fall of the ancient Siam capital of Ayutthaya in 1767, the invading Burmese troops held thousands of Thais hostage and took them as prisoners to Burma
 inamen badi sankhya main thai kickboxr shaamil the, jinhen awa shahar le jaaya gaya
 In 1774, in the city of Rangoon, Burma, King Hassinbushin of Burma decided to hold a seven-day and seven-night religious festival in honor of the relics of the Buddha
 is utsav main kai prakaar ke manoranjan ke sadhano ko shaamil kiya gaya, jaise vishesh poshaak main like naamak naatakon, hasya pradarshnon or tamaashon or talwaar kii ladaai ke maichon kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 At one point, King Hsienbushin wanted to see how Mayan Boran could be compared with the Burmese art Lethwei
 naai khanomathome ko burmese champion ke khilaaf ladane ke liye chunaa gaya
 The boxing ring was erected in front of the throne and Nai Khanomtom performed a traditional y crew dance before the battle to show respect to his teachers and ancestors, as well as to show respect for the audience by dancing around his opponent 
 isane burma ke logon ko hairaan kar diya, ve uljhan main pad gaye, unhen laga ki yah kaala jaadu he
 When the fight began, Nai Khanomtom attacked his opponent using punch, kick, elbow and knee until he was battered
 haalanki burma ke referi ne kaha ki burma kaa champion kik se bahut adhik vichlit ho gaya tha or nokout ko amaanya ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The king then said that Nai Khanomtom would have to fight nine Burmese champions to prove himself
 vah sahamat ho gaya or usne bich main bina aaraam kiye, ek ek karke sabase ladaai kii
 His last opponent was a great teacher of kickboxing from Rakhine
 nai khanomathome ne use apni kicks se ghayal kar diya, iske baad kisi or ne use chunauti dene kii himmat nahin jutai
 King Mangara was so impressed that he reportedly remarked, "every part of Thai is full of poison
" nihattha hote hue bhi vah nau das pratidwandviyon ko haraa saktaa he
 But his master was incompetent and lost his country to the enemy
 agar vah sakasham hota to aisa ho hi nahin saktaa tha ki ayuthaya shahar kaa patan ho jaataa
 King Mangra freed Nai Khanomtom, and also asked him to choose for himself money or one of two beautiful wives
 Nai Khanomtom chose wives because he told that wealth could be obtained easily
 iske baad vah apni patniyon ke saath siam chalaa gaya
 Other versions of this story suggest that his fellow Thai prisoners were also released as a result of his victory
 unke or may boron ke sammaan main, unki jeet ke utsav ko har saal 17 march ko boxr diwas yaa rashtriya may boron diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Currently some people relate this famous legend of Nai Khanomtom to King Naresoun, who was once taken by the Burmese
 haalanki, nai khanomathome or raja naresoun do alag alag shatabdiyon main hue
 Formal Muay Thai techniques are divided into two groups: mei mai or main techniques and luk mai or short techniques
 may thai aksar sangharshan kii ek ladaai kii kala he, jisamen virdohi ek duusare ke saath mudraon kaa vinimay karte hai
 This is certainly prevalent among traditional players in Thailand, but is a less popular art in the contemporary world where the Thai style of currency exchange is not more favorable for currency
 may thai kii lagbhag sabhi takneekon main puure sharir kii gatiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, har kik, panch, albo or block ke saath kulhon main ghurnan kiya jaataa he
 The punch technique in Muay Thai is basically quite limited, with a long round strike with a straight arm and landing with a palm heel
 pashchimi boxing or pashchimi marshall arts ke saath sankaran ke dwaara pashchimi boxing panchon kii puri range kaa ab upyog kiya jaataa he: lead job, street / kros, hook, aprakat, shoval or corcscru panch or overhands or saath hi hemer fist or back fist
 Compared to most other striking martial arts, body piercing is used less as a tactic in Muay Thai to protect the blower's head from knees and elbow counter strikes
 lakshya binduon kii range kaa upyog karne ke liye, kendriya rekha siddhant ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, pratiyogi pashchimi yaa thai mudra kaa upyog kar saktaa he, jo sangrakshan se samjhauta kiye bina lambi yaa choti range ke praharon ko prabhavi rup se karne main madad karata he
 The elbow can be used as a stabbing weapon in several ways: diagonal upwards, diagonal-downwards, uppercuts, downwards, backward-spinning, and flying
 said se iskaa upyog ek phinishing move ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he yaa is tarah se pratidwandvi kii bhunh ko kaatane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he jisase khun uski drushti ko block kar saktaa he
 Diagonal elbows are faster than any other strike but are less powerful
 single albo or ek pholo-ap albo ke bich ek spasht antar he
 a single elbow is a hit that is independent of any other hit, while a follow-up elbo is the second hit to be the same arm, with the first hit being a hook or straight punch, followed by the elbow follow-up
 
 kohni ke aise praharon or kohni ke anya praharon kaa upyog, tab kiya jaataa he jab pratidwandviyon ke bich kii duuri bahut kam ho jaati he or pratidwandvi ke sir par hook kaa prahaar karne ke liye jagah bahut kam hoti he
 Elbow blows are used to block an opponent's blows, protect themselves from it, and minimize its impact, for example spring knee, side body knee, body kick or punch
 may thai main do sabase aam kik thip or te chiang yaa angel kik kehalaati hai
 Muay Thai's angle kick uses a rotating motion of the entire body and has also been widely adopted by other martial arts professionals
 yah satahi rup se karate kii round house kik ke samaan he, lekin isamen ghutane se lower leg kaa ghurnan nahin hota, jo ki adhikansh karate or taikvondo jaisi anya striking marshall arts main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Because in Kukushin, Goju and Kenpo it is performed in a round posture, with the posterior leg slightly lower than the upper body fighting
 yah karate or tikvondo ke vipareet jokhim ko badhaata he, udhaaharan ke liye ek kik ke baad ke thode se kshan apwaad hai
 Angle kick forces the body completely; The rotation of the hips is applied by motion
 aisi soch he ki kai pratidwandvi is kik kii kshamta ko teevr banane ke liye bhujaa ke counter roteshan kaa upyog karte hai, lekin vastav main kshamta kulhon se aati he or bhujaaon ko bataai gayi avasthaa main rakhaa jaataa he
 If a round house kick has been hit by an opponent, the Thai boxer will usually check the kick and block the kick from his shin
 The Thai boxer is trained to always be associated with the shin
 pair main kai choti haddiyaan hoti hai or yah kamjor hota he
 If a contestant tries to hit with his leg or instep, he can protect himself from injury
 may thai main kai anya prakaar ke kik bhi shaamil hai, jaise said kik or spinning back kik
is prakaar kii kik kaa upyog kuch pratiyogiyon ke dwaara keval muqablon main hi kiya jaataa he
 According to a written source, this technique is more modern than Khao Dot or Khao Loi
 mana jaataa he, jab thai boxr boxing ke aadhunik dastaanon ke bajaay rassi se bandhe haathon se ladate the, tab is vishesh takanic kaa upyog ek sachet pratidwandvi ke dwaara shaatir tareeke se kating, slising or soing main kiya jaataa tha
 While the front opponent used to prevent this strike from the sharp edges of the "rope gloves", sometimes the rope was soaked in water and wet so that the rope would become stronger
 This description is also true for some knee strikes below
 foot-thrust yaa shabdic rup se foot-jaib may thai kii takneekon main se ek he
 It is mainly used to block attacks ie to stop and control the distance
 foot-thrust ko bahut teji se daalaa janaa chahie lekin saath hi yah itnaa shashakt bhi hona chahie ki yah pratidwandvi ke santulan ko bigaad sake
 In Western boxing, the two rivals are separated when they grab each other; In Muay Thai, however, this is not done
 is jakadan yaa clinch main ghutane or kohni kii takneekon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In the clinch, small amounts of stand-up grappling are used to strike and block the opponent for both offensive and defensive purposes
 front clinch kaa upyog ek haath kii hatheli se duusare ke pichley hisse par kiya jaataa he
 There are three reasons why fingers should not be used
 1) The opponent in the ring is wearing gloves, so he cannot use his fingers
 2) In Thai front clinch, the opponent's head is pressed downwards, this is easier when the hands are closed behind the head and not behind the neck
 Apart from this, maximum pressure should be put on the neck as far as possible by the arms
 3) If an opponent uses the fingers, his or her fingers may be hurt and it becomes more difficult to grip the front opponent's head to hit the elbow faster
 ek sahi clinch main pratiyogi apni bhujaa ke agle hisse se pratidwandvi kii collar bone ko dabaata he, is samay uske haath pratidwandvi kii gardan ke chaaron ore naa hokar uske sir ke chaaron ore hote hai
 a common way to get out of this clinch is to push the opponent's head backwards or hit the elbow, because the clinch requires both contestants to be very close to each other
 iske atirikt, ek aprabhavi clinchar apni bhujaaon ko neeche kii ore tathaa pratidwandvi ke clinch ke andar "tairaane" kii koshish kar saktaa he, jisase aprabhavi clinchar ek prabhavi clinchar ban saktaa he
 There are several other types of clinch or chep khao in Muay Thai, including: may thai main raksha yaa bachaav ko chah samoohon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he: For example, the defender moves his front leg backwards to avoid the offensive's low kick and then immediately strikes back with an angle kick
 yaa rakshak apane sir ko aakraamak kii unchi angel kik se peeche kar letaa he or ek said kik ke saath javaabi prahaar karata he
 For defense, the concept of "wall of defense" is used, using the shoulders, arms and legs to prevent the aggressor from implementing the technique
 blocking yaa avrodh may thai main ek jatil avyav he or isamen niyamon kaa vah str shaamil he jo ek safal peshewar main hona chahie
lo or mid bodi roundouse kik ko aamtaur par uthaai hui shin ke upari bhaag se roka jaataa he
 High body strikes are prevented with the forearm, glove, elbow or shin
 midsection roundouse kik ko bhi pakadaa / roka ja saktaa he, jisase pratidwandvi ke taang ke shesh hisse par balpurvak yaa javaabi prahaar karne main madad milti he
 The punch is prevented with a simple boxing guard or similar technique, the basic technique of boxing can be used if similar technique cannot be used
 ek panch ko rokane ke liye saamanyatya panch ke aane kii disha kii said se haath kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a conservative contestant puts a jab, the defender will put a slight tape in the direction of the angle of the punch with his right hand
 The deflection should always be short and precise so that there is no unnecessary expenditure of energy and the hand should be returned to the guard as soon as possible
 The hook is often restrained at a pace that is described as "combing the hair", that is, lifting the elbow forward and effectively protecting the head with the help of forearms, flexible biceps, and shoulders
 
 adhik unnat may thai block aamtaur par counter hai, jinka upyog agle hamale ko rokane ke liye aakraamak ko kshati pahuchane main kiya jaataa he
 Like most competitive full-contact, fighting games, Muay Thai Bodi focuses heavily on conditioning
 may thai ko vishesh rup se ring pratispardhaa ke liye aavashyak sharir kii fitness or jatilta ke str ko badhaava dene ke liye banaaya gaya he
 During the training of this complex sport many exercises are done such as running, shedoboxing, rope jumping, body weight blocking exercises, medicine ball exercises, abdominal exercises and in some cases weight training
 Muay Thai professionals usually apply Namman Mu before and after their intensive training sessions
 prashikshan jo may thai ke pratiyogi ke liye vishesh he, usamen thai pads, focus mits, baari bag or spering aadi ke saath prashikshan shaamil he
 In different methods of practice, daily training consists of several rounds
 Thai pad training is an important part of Muay Thai conditioning, in which punch, kick, knee and elbow strikes are practiced with an instructor who wears thick pads on his arms and forearms
 in vishesh pads kaa upyog aakraamak ke prahaar ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or isse aakraamak pad holder ke prahaar kaa jawaab sajiv rup main de paata he
 The trainer also often wears a belly pad to cover his abdominal area, allowing the aggressor to hit a straight kick or knee at his body at any time during the round
 focus mits kaa upyog aakraamak ke haathon kii gati, panch ke sangyojan, samay nirdhaaran, panch kii kshamta, raksha yaa bachaav or javaabi prahaar ke prashikshan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 And it is also used to practice elbow stroke
 baari bag prashikshan ek condishning or shakti vyaayaam he jo pad par abhyaas kii takanic se sambandhit he
 Sparring is a technique in which skill, range, strategy, and timing are tested against the partner
 spering aksar ek halke se madhyam sampark vyaayaam hota he kyonki pratispardhiyon ko aisi salaah nahin di jaati ki ve mushkil spering ke dwaara kisi tarah kii chot kaa jokhim len
 Specific techniques and strategies are trained with specific sparring including close fighting, clinching, knee strikes only, cutting the ring, or even using reach and distance to keep distance from a fierce aggressor
 kathor prashikshan vyaayaam ke kaaran peshewar may thai pratiyogi ring main karier kaa apekshaakrit kam samay bitaate hai
 Many professionals retire to train the next generation of Thai competitors
 adhikansh peshewar thai boxr kamjor aarti aarthik prishthbhumi se aate hai or apane parivaar ko sahaara dene ke liye dhan ke liye is kshetra main bane rahete hai
 Very few Thai people of high economic status rank in the professional Muay Thai ranks; They usually play this game only as an amateur Muay Thai boxer
 
 Muay Thai is played in many different countries and its rules vary by country
 ye niyam us sanstha par bhi nirbhar karte hai jisamen iskaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 The following link refers to the rules section of the Sports Authority of Thailand
 may thai, kii tarah kii boxing or kickboxing ke anya roopon ko meme ke bheetar prahaar kaa ek prabhavi aadhaar mana jaataa he or meme ke pratiyogiyon ko iskaa prashikshan bade paimaane par diya jaataa he
 Contestants such as Anderson Silva, Wonderlei Silva, Marisio Rua, Thiago Silva, Alister Ovrim, Jose Aldo, Paul Dalle, Gina Karano are better known for their Thai boxing backgrounds
 anginat anya mishrit marshall kalakaaron ne may thai main prashikshan praapt kiya he or ise aksar meme gym main bijeje or kushti ke rup main sikhaaya jaataa he
 Many techniques related to Muay Thai are often seen in MMA, such as punch, elbow, clinch fighting, leg kick and knee
 pichley das varshon main may thai kii ore rujhaan badha he, kyonki filmon or television ne marshall art ko lokapriy banaaya he
 The most notable professional of Muay Thai is Tony Jaa, very popular in martial arts

 Sagat and Adon from Street Fighter, Joey Higashi from King of Fighters and King, Bruce Irwin from Tekken and Brad Burns from Virtua Fighter are all noted as martial arts professionals

 From England, he wrote a letter to Dasababu and expressed his desire to work with him
 rabindranath thakur kii salaah ke anusaar bharat waapas aane par ve sarvapratham mumbai gayi or mahatma gandhi se mili
 Gandhi lived in Mani Bhavan in Mumbai
 vahaan 20 july 1921 ko gandhi ji or subhash ke bich pehali mulaakaat hui
 Gandhiji advised him to go to Kolkata and work with Dasbabu
 iske baad subhash kolkata aakar dasababu se mili
 In those days Gandhiji started a non-cooperation movement against the British government
 dasababu is aandolan kaa bengal main netritv kar rahe the
 Subhash joined them in this movement
 1922 main dasababu ne congress ke antargat swaraj party kii sthapana kii
 Swaraj Party contested the election of Kolkata Mahapalika to oppose the British government from inside the assembly and Dasbabu became the Mayor of Kolkata
 unhone subhash ko mahapalika kaa pramukh kaaryakari adhikari banaaya
 During his tenure, Subhash changed the entire structure and way of working of Kolkata Mahapalika
 kolkata main sabhi raaston ke angrezi naam badalakar unhen bhartiya naam diye gayi
 Families of those who gave up their lives in the freedom struggle started getting jobs in the Mahapalika
 bahut jald hi subhash desh ke ek mahatvapurn yuva netaa ban gayi
 Subhash along with Jawaharlal Nehru started the Independence League of Youth under the Congress
 1928 main jab simon kamishan bharat aayaa tab congress ne use kaale jhande dikhaaye
 Subhash led this movement in Kolkata
 simon kamishan ko jawaab dene ke liye congress ne bharat kaa bhavi samvidhan banane kaa kaam aath sadasyeey ayog ko saunpa
 Motilal Nehru was the chairman of this commission and Subhash was a member of it
 is ayog ne nehru report pesh kii
 In 1928, the annual Congress session was held in Kolkata under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 is adhiveshan main subhash ne khaaki ganavesh dhaaran karke motilal nehru ko sainya tareeke se salaami di
 Gandhiji did not agree with the demand for complete self-rule in those days
 is adhiveshan main unhone angrez sarkaar se dominian states maangane kii thaan lee thi
 But Subhash Babu and Jawaharlal Nehru did not agree to retreat from the demand of complete Swaraj
 ant main yah tay kiya gaya ki angrez sarkaar ko dominian states dene ke liye ek saal kaa vakt diya jaye
 If the British government did not meet this demand in a year, the Congress would demand full Swaraj
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii
 Therefore, in 1930, when the annual Congress session was held in Lahore under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, it was decided that 26 January would be celebrated as Independence Day
 26 janvari 1931 ko kolkata main raashtra dhvaj fahraakar subhash ek vishaal morche kaa netritv kar rahe the tabhi police ne un par lathi chalaayi or unhen ghayal kar jail bhej diya
 While Subhash was in jail, Gandhiji compromised with the British government and got all the prisoners released
 lekin angrej sarkaar ne bhagat singh jaise krantikariyon ko reeha karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Gandhiji spoke to the government to forgive Bhagat Singh's execution, but with tenderness
 subhash chaahate the ki is vishay par gandhiji angrej sarkaar ke saath kiya gaya samjhauta tod den
 But Gandhiji was not ready to break his promise
 angrej sarkaar apane sthaan par adi rahi or bhagat singh va unke saathiyon ko phaansi de di gayi
 Subhash Gandhi became very angry with Gandhi and Congress methods for not saving Bhagat Singh
 apane saarvajanik jivan main subhash ko kul 11 baar karawas hua
 First he was imprisoned for six months on 16 July 1921
 1925 main gopinath saaha naamak ek krantikari kolkata ke police adheekshak charlas tegart ko maarna chahta tha
 He accidentally killed a businessman named Ernest Day
 iske liye use phaansi kii sajaa di gayi
 Subhash wept bitterly after Gopinath was hanged
 unhone gopinath kaa shav mangekar uskaa antim sanskaar kiya
 This led the British government to conclude that Subhash not only had connections with fiery revolutionaries, but he also inspired them
 isi bahaane angrez sarkaar ne subhash ko giraftaar kiya or bina koi mukadmaa chalaaye unhen anishchit kaal ke liye myanmaar ke mandle karagrih main bandi banaakar bhej diya
 On 5 November 1925 Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das died in Kolkata
 subhash ne unki mrityu kii khabar mandle karagrih main radio par suni
 While staying at Mandalay prison, Subhash got very sick
 unhen tapedic ho gaya
 But the British government still refused to release him
 sarkaar ne unhen reeha karne ke liye yah shart rakhi ki ve ilaaj ke liye europe chale jaayen
 But the government did not clarify when they could return to India after treatment
 isliye subhash ne yah shart sweekaar nahin kii
 Eventually, the situation became so difficult that the jail authorities began to feel that they might not die in prison
 angrez sarkaar yah khatra bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi ki subhash kii karagrih main mrityu ho jaye
 Therefore, the government released him
 uske baad subhash ilaaj ke liye dalhousie chale gayi
 Subhash was in imprisonment in 1930 when he was elected the Mayor of Kolkata in the elections
 isliye sarkaar unhen reeha karne par majaboor ho gayi
 Subhash was again imprisoned in 1932
 is baar unhen almoda jail main rakhaa gaya
 His health deteriorated again in Almora jail
 chikitsakon kii salaah par subhash is baar ilaaj ke liye europe jane ko raji ho gayi
 Subhash lived in Europe from 1933 to 1936
 europe main subhash ne apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhte hue apana kaary badastoor jari rakhaa
 There he met Mussolini, the leader of Italy, who pledged to assist him in India's freedom struggle
 ireland ke netaa di valera subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 The days when Subhash was in Europe, Kamala Nehru, wife of Jawaharlal Nehru, died in Austria
 subhash ne vahaan jaakar jawaharlal nehru ko santvana di
 Subhash later met Vitthal Bhai Patel in Europe
 vitthal bhai patel ke saath subhash ne mantranaa kii jise patel-bose vishleshan ke naam se prasiddhi mili
 In this analysis, both of them strongly condemned Gandhi's leadership
 uske baad vitthal bhai patel jab biimaar ho gayi to subhash ne unki bahut seva kii
 But Vitthal Bhai Patel did not survive, he died
 vitthal bhai patel ne apni vasiyat main apni sari sampatti subhash ke naam kar di
 But after his death, his brother Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not accept this will
 sardaar patel ne is vasiyat ko lekar adaalat main mukadmaa chalaaya
 On winning this case, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gifted all of his brother's property to the Harijan service of Gandhi
 1934 main subhash ko unke pita ke mrityushyya par hone kii khabar mili
 As soon as he heard the news, he returned to Kolkata via airplane via Karachi
 yadhyapi karachi main hi unhe pataa chal gaya tha ki unke pita kii mrittyu ho chuki he phir bhi ve kolkata gayi
 As soon as he reached Kolkata, the British government arrested him and kept him in jail for several days and sent him back to Europe
 san 1934 main jab subhash austria main apana ilaaj karaane hetu tehre hue the us samay unhen apni pustak likhane hetu ek angreji jaanane vaale typist kii aavashyaktaa hui
 a friend of his met an Austrian woman named Emily Shankel
 emily ke pita ek prasiddh pashu chikitsak the
 Subhash was attracted to Emily and the two fell in natural love
 naaji germany ke sakht kanoonon ko dekhte hue un donon ne san 1942 main bad gastin naamak sthaan par hindu paddati se vivaah rachaa liya
 Emily gave birth to a daughter in Vienna
 subhash ne use pehali baar tab dekha jab vah mushkil se chaar saptaah kii thi
 They named her Anita Bose
 agast 1945 main taiwan main hui tathakthith vimaan durghatana main jab subhash kii maut hui, anita paune teen saal kii thi
 Anita is still alive
 uskaa naam anita bose phalf he
 Anita Faf sometimes comes to India to meet her father's family
 1938 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan haripura main hona tay hua
 Prior to this session, Gandhi chose Subhash for the post of Congress President
 yah congress kaa 51 vaan adhiveshan tha
 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili
 He announced that now that India has a golden opportunity, it should intensify its campaign for liberation
 8 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh ke prati party kaa rukh tay karne ke liye subhash ko vishesh aamantrit ke rup main congress kaary samiti main bulaayaa gaya
 He also reiterated with his opinion that if the Congress cannot do this work, the forward block will start a war against the British Raj on its own
 agle hi varsh july main kalakatta sthit halwat stambh jo bharat kii gulaami kaa pratik tha subhash kii youth brigade ne ratorat vah stambh mitti main mila diya
 Subhash's volunteers uprooted each brick of his foundation
 yah ek pratikatmak shuruyaat thi
 Through this, Subhash had given the message that as he has mixed this column in the dust, in the same way, he will also play brick by brick of the British Empire
 iske parinamswaroop angrej sarkaar ne subhash sahit forward block ke sabhi mukhya netaaon ko kaid kar liya
 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police
 sharadbabu ke bade bete shishir ne unhe apni gaadi se kolkata se dur gomoh tak pahunchaaya
 They reached Peshawar after catching a frontier mail from Gomoh railway station
 peshawar main unhen forward block ke ek sahakaari, miyaan akbar shah mili
 Mian Akbar Shah met him with Bhagatram Talwar of Kirti Kisan Party
 bhagatraam talwaar ke saath subhash peshawar se afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ore nikal pade
 In this journey, Pathan and Subhash named Bhagatram Talwar Rahmat Khan became his deaf and dumb deaf
 pahadiyon main paidal chalate hue unhone yah safar puraa kiya
 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him
 aakhir main arlando mazonta naamak italian vyakti banakar subhash kabul se nikalakar rus kii rajdhani masco hote hue germany kii rajdhani berlin pahunche
 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay kinhin bhi do deshon kii nausenaon kii pandubbiyon ke dwaara nagarikon kii yah ekmaatr adla-badali hui thi
 This Japanese submarine brought them to Padang Port in Indonesia
 purvi asia pahunchakar subhash ne sarvapratham vayovruddh krantikari rasbihari bose se bhartiya swatantrata parishad kaa netritv sanbhaala
 Rasbihari voluntarily handed over the leadership of the Freedom Council to Subhash in Singapore's Edward Park
 japan ke pradhanmantri general hideki tojo ne netaji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar unhen sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan
 21 oktober 1943 ke din netaji ne singapore main arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind kii sthapana kii
 He himself became the President, Prime Minister and War Minister of this government
 is sarkaar ko kul nau deshon ne manyata di
 Netaji also became the chief commander of the Azad Hind Fauj
 azaad hind fouj main japani sena ne angrejon kii fouj se pakade hue bhartiya yudhbandiyon ko bhartee kiya tha
 The Rani Regiment of Jhansi was also formed for women in Azad Hind Fauj
 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 Japanese general Shodei, Pilate, and some others aboard the plane were killed
 netaji gambheer rup se jal gayi the
 He was rushed to Taihoku military hospital where he succumbed
 karnal habiburrahman ke anusaar unka antim sanskaar taihoku main hi kar diya gaya
 In mid-september, their bones were collected and placed in the Rankoji temple of Tokyo, the capital of Japan
 bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar se praapt dastauez ke anusaar netaji kii mrityu 18 agast 1945 ko taihoku ke sainik aspataal main raatri 21
00 baje hui thi
 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country

 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity

 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this

 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country

 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha

 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke sankalan evam prakaashan kaary se aarambh se hi sugat bose bhi jude hue the or antim do khandon kaa prakaashan dow0 shishir kumaar bose ke dukhad nidhan ke kaaran mukhyatah sugat bose ke hi sampadan main hua
 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that like Mahatma Gandhi, in the context of Netaji too, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed

 Since communication between the two parties continues, it is imperative to pay fixed fees and expenses, including government taxes, or death charges
 Actually, there is no such tax to be paid
 haalanki shulk yaa karon kaa bhugtan karne kii jarurat kaa prayog to kisi bhi muft dhan ko gaayab karne or / yaa shikaar se paise anthne ke liye ke liye keval ek bahaane ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Eventually, hunting will be convinced by various means and equipment that the trunk contains a large amount of cash which is valid, or even if it is not valid, the whole amount of cash is included in a very big reason
 iske alaava, seemaa shulk kii jaanch se bachane ke liye sari kagaji mudra ko kaale rang se pot diya gaya he
 a valid reason will be given for this: "the deceased traded artifacts in Africa and had to pay in cash for some expensive item before dying
 seemaa shulk or chori kii samasyaon se bachane ke liye kagaji mudra ko kaala karnaa tha" shikaar vyakti aashwast he ki kagaji mudra kii dhulaai ke liye aavashyak rasinic ke paise bhi sandook main hi hai
 The aggrieved person has already paid some money to pay the fees and taxes and can now be called to pay the shipping expenses to deliver the box to his home

 When at one point the victim begins to suspect, or shows an unwillingness to pay even more, in such a situation he will be invited to self-inspect the contents of the security deposit box
 The entire ceremony and fumigation will be opened
 The victim will be informed that these banknotes have been blackened with an almost indestructible chemical, but there exists a chemical that can clean the banknote
 tab vah makkaar aadmi washing liquid kii ek choti shishi shikaar vyakti ko pesh karte hue yadrichhik kisi bhi kaale bank note kaa chayan karne ke liye kahegaa
 yah ho jane par, vah makkaar rasinic drav se banknote dhone ke liye aage badhata he, haath kii safaai kaa khel pesh karte hue, asli note ko sthanapann kar detaa he jo dhulaa hua he
 There will now be insufficient liquid left to wash more notes, money to do, or it may be that Makkar "accidentally" drops the bottle on the floor
 shikaar vyakti sandook ko, yaa kisi bhi note ko saath nahin le ja saktaa he, kyonki use yah suchit kiya ja chukaa he ki karon kaa bhugtan nahin kiya gaya he, lekin ek baar note jab dhul jaaenge, to karon kaa bhugtan kiya janaa aasaan ho jayega or phir bhi lakhon bache rah jaaenge
 shikaar vyakti ko noton ko dhone hetu chemical kharidne ke liye raji kiya jaataa he or nihsandeh safai kaa rasinic taral padaarth "bahut mahanga" he
 The victim once again pays the fraudster money
 kabhi kabhi jaalsaaj safai ke taral padaarth vikreta ke rup main ek website bana legaa, jiskaa saafe jaahir he ek aisa ajooba or asaamaanya naam hoga ki kahin bhi nahin mil saktaa he
 This will increase the credibility of the story further and the victim can directly contact the website to buy liquids, which will give Makkar another chance of forgery
 jaalsaaj bahaane khojane jari rakhenge shikaar ko uskaa paisa abhi tak kyon nahin mil saktaa he, lekin hameshaa ek "antim or bilkul antim" kadam ke baad yah vaada karata rahegaa, jisame spasht rup se shikaar ke liye abhi tak ek or shulk kaa bhugtan karnaa shaamil hoga
 Scammers will keep on hunting until they are convinced that there is no more money and they can no longer borrow from anyone or borrow from friends or banks, or until the victim realizes that The scam is happening and the police may be involved
 yah kahana anaavashyak he ki jabatak police shaamil hoti he tabatak jaalsaaj khud or peedit vyakti ke paise aamtaur par gaayab ho gaye hote hai
 Most such frauds are not reported by the victims for several reasons
 pehle pahal to ve bahut sharminda mahasoos karte hai ki ve itane bhole ho sakate hai ki koi thag le

 She demands Mukesh his rights

 Om Kapoor makes a plan together with Pappu, Bella and other companions to avenge Shanti's death
 om mukesh se tay karata he ki ve donon phir se 'om shanti om' film kaa nirmaan karenge
 Then Om and his assistant seek Shantipriya's lookalike
 unhen sandhyaa yaa 'sandy" naam kii yuvati milti he jo dekhne main shantipriya ke samaan or 'o ke' kii divaani he
 And then their plan begins - Om plays games with Mukesh
 sandy shanti ke rup main mukesh ke samane baar baar aati he

 lekin phir ek din mukesh jaan jaataa he ki yah yuvati koi or he, shanti nahin
 He becomes alert
 ant main set par om or mukesh main hathapayee hoti he
 Om states that he was witness to the killing of Shanti by Mukesh in his previous birth
 mukesh use chunauti detaa he ki purvajanm kii baat par koi bhi adaalat vishwaas nahin karegi
 Just then, a young woman in the guise of peace comes there and says that just below the chandelier on the set, the proof of murder is buried - her body, which Mukesh had buried alive under the ground
 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it
 duusari ore se pappu ke saath sandy kamare main aa jaati he
 Om then realizes that Sandi, not the one who spoke the evidence, was the soul of the real Shantipriya, who avenged his killer
