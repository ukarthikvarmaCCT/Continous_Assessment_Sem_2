 suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda dharmaveer bharti kaa prasiddh upanyaas he
 In this miniature novel by Dharmavir Bharati, a novel has been produced in the form of stories told in 7 dupahis in the style of Hittopadesh and Panchatantrawali
 yah pustak ke rup main bhartiya gyanpith se It has been called a short novel
 kathanak kii bunaavat upanyaas kii vishay–vastu ko nae aayam pradaan karti he
 The 'seventh horse of the sun' is also believed to be influenced by the ancient styles of indo-iran
 lekin, puraani kissagoi kaa yah tarika –alifalaila, panchatantr, dashakumarcharit athwa kathasaritsagar – ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ kii upree twachaa maatr he, ise kathanak kaa buniyadi dhaanchaa nahin mana ja saktaa
 a second style can also be reflected in this - that is, a genre like the Veeraagathaas or other epics, in which the creator is not only the author of his works, but also himself is present in the midst of events
 vah bhokta or rachayita donon he
 In this way, creation becomes an obligation to be neutral, to transform private cognition into public experience
 ‘prithviraj raso’ ke rachayita chandvardaayi iske mahatvapoorn charitra bhi hai, thik usee tarah jaise valmiki or tulsi khud ko apni rachanaaon main upasthit kar dete hai yaa ki sanjay mahabharat ke ghatnachakra main maujuud he
 Manik Mulla narrates the tales of 'suraj Ka Seventh Horse', but he is not only the speaker of these stories - he is present with great vigor among them
 ve in kahaniyon ke bhokta bhi hai, thik valmiki, sanjay or chand kii tarah
 It is said that Chandavardayi did not complete the 'raso' and handed it over to his son Jalahan
 ‘raso’ ke antim ansh usee ke dwaara likhe gaye, thik isi prakaar ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ kii kahaniyaan hai to sunai hui maanik mullah kii, parantu unhen prastut karata he unka ek shrota ’main’
 'I' is its original author but he, like Tulsi of Ramcharit Manas, who becomes merely the presenter of ram-katha's shiva-parvati dialogue - comes before us
 vah maanik dwaara sunai kahaniyon ke bare main kahata he ki “ant main main yah bhi spasht kar dena chahta hoon ki is laghu upanyaas kii vishay-vastu main jo kuch bhalaai-buraai ho uskaa jimmaa mujh par nahin maanik mullah par hi he
 i have just put that story in front of you in my own way ''
 yah lekhak–prastota bhi katha main bhale hi ek maamuli haisiyat se-ek shrota ke rup main- maujuud he
 Creations and creators have been a smooth movement in the Indian tradition
 yah upanyaas bhi apane kathanak kii bunaavat main katha or kathakaar kii tadrupata ko sambhav hone detaa he
 Real and imagination begin to complement each other
 yadi kaha jaay ki madhyavarg aadha yatharth or aadha swapn main jeene vaala varg he to galat na hoga
 For creation, the combination of imagination and reality is an essential condition
 isliye madhyavarg sarvaadhik srujansheel, swapnjivi or badlavamulak hota he 
 The 'seventh horse of the sun' presents the story of this middle class - with its contradictory positions - to us
 is rachana ke kathanak ko nae kalevar main buna gaya he
 It started with a nuisance
 upodghaat yani prastaavna, bhoomika
 Four Anadhyas have also been added in between the main story-chapters
 inke atirikt puri katha saat dopaharon main vibhakt he
 The story of the seven afternoons is from Manik Mulla and the four Anadhyayas including Upodhgadha are the comments of his listener 'I'
 kul milakar baarah bhaagon main vibhajit yah katha maanik mullah ke jivan samet unke sampark main aae pramukh charitron- jamuna, lily or satti kii jindagi par prakaash daalati he
 Also, it shows how Manik Mulla's audience reacted to the references associated with these characters
 apni inhen mili-juli ghatnaon ko lekar yah upanyaas aakaar grahan karata he
 In the nuptials, we get to know about Manik Mulla's personality, his interests, his ability to create stories and his style of narration
 yaheen hamen yah bhi pataa chalata he ki, ‘’agar kaaphi fursat ho, puraa ghar adhikaar main ho, chaar mitra baithe hon, to nishchit he ki gum-phirakar vaarta raajnneeti par aa tikegi or jab raajnneeti main dilchaspee khatm hone lagegi to goshtee kii vaarta ‘prem’ par aa tikegi
 But as far as literary dialogue was concerned, he preferred love
 in kathanon se pataa chalata he ki upanyaas lekhan ke liye jaruri upkaran koun se hai
 They are - leisure time, people who are on their own leisure and are looking for stories to cut it, in a place where there is no external disturbance
 raajnneeti, prem or sahitya upanyaas ke sahaj-swaabhaavik vishay ho sakate hai
 The seventh horse of the sun is created using these tools
 isaliye yah kriti viraat saamaajik prashnon ko nazarandaaj kar vaiyaktik sandarbhon se rachi jaati he
 It has been kept in the category of short novel rather than in the category of epic novel
 adarsh kii sthapana ke bajaay yatharth kaa udghaatan hi iske kendra main he
 This reality also evokes smallness in its senses and emotions, more than just common everyday events
 maanik mullah samet sabhi charitra ek ausat charitra hai, ve apni dainik ghatnaon se hi itane abhibhoot hai ki desh-duniya or samaaj ko apni nijee nigahon se jaanchne-parakhane kaa kaam karte he
 That is why they have a reduced understanding of big social philosophy
 girija kumaar maathur ne ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ ke rachana-vidhaan ko teen katha-vritton main vibhajit kiya he
 The center of the first story is Manik Mulla
 jamuna, lily or tanna centre ke upgrah
 The center of the second story is also Manik Mulla, satellites of Sati, Mahesar and Chaman Singh Center
 teesraa katha-vrutt ‘main’ kaa he, jiske ek ore marxvaadi siddhanton kaa vyangypurna chithran he or duusari ore vyaktivaadee kala-paksh
 This circle is secondary
 girija kumaar maathur ne aage isaki shilpagat visheshtaon kaa ullekh karte hue tippanee kii he ki, “anadhyaay main ‘main’ ne sabake charitra kaa vishleshan kisi na kisi rup main kiya he, kintu maanik mullah se uskaa itnaa moh he ki kahin bhi unka santulit vishleshan usne nahin hone diya he
 That is, the listener named 'I' who created the story, claims within the novel that i am presenting Manik Katha as it is, and for everything else, including technics, he is responsible to Manik Mulla
 Is, but he could not remain neutral
 is upanyaas kii sanrachana main jaise maanik ke bare main prakaash kaa mat tha ki, “ho na ho maanik mullah main bhi hindi ke anya kahanikaron kii tarah nari ke prati kuch obseshan he
 "some such obsession is about the ruby of 'I'
" vah maanik ke vishisht vyaktiv se abhibhoot he or sankalpabaddh hokar unki kahaniyon ko bachaane kaa udhyam karata he 
 This unique listener 'I' definitely considered these stories to be important, that's why Manik Mulla has been committed towards saving them
 isaliye ‘main’ ko maanik mullah kii kahaniyon kaa tatasth prastota nahin mana ja saktaa, varan ‘main’ or maanik ek nahin to adhikanshat: ek jaise vyakti hai
 That is why Mathur considers the third circle as secondary
 khayr, is upanyaas ke mukhya sarokaar maanik kii kahaniyon ke ird-gird hi viksit hote hai
 They may seem limited in sight, but who would deny that most of our life's energy is spent solving these small problems and the middle class people feel able to realize themselves through these achievements
 isliye ‘suraj kaa satvon ghoda’ laghutaa main mahat ke talash kii ullekhneey kriti ban jaati he, or madhyavarg kii adamya aakanksha ko pratibimbit karti he
 In the novel there is activation of lyrical values
 yathartwaadee nazariye ke bina upanyaas kii rachana sambhav nahin
 We can consider the novel as an artistic alternative to life
 ek upanyaaskaar ghatnaon, charitron, paristhitiyon, samvaad aadi ke madhyam se ek duniya apane upanyaas main basaata he
 These characters, despite not being real, create a sense of reality and present 'evidence to deal with the complexities of life and society'
 upanyaaskaar jin vibhinn tatwon se apni aupnyasik duniya banaata he, unamem kathanak, cathopakathan, deshkal, style, or uddeshy mahatvapurn hote hai
 Nityananda Tiwari believes that, "every novelist, by his own vision, organizes these elements from within him by ripping off life's problems
 ye tatv yantric formule nahin 
 His role is not the regulator, but the director
 ‘suraj kaa saatvaan ghoda’ main in tatwon kii upasthiti ek santulit anupaat main aati he, lekin niztaa puure katha-vinyas main adhik sakriy rahati he

 Many of his criticism books have been published and his criticisms are also published in various journals and magazines
 saarvajanik santhaan saarvajanik santhaan vidhayak nirmit sanstha he jo saamaajik, vanijyik, aarthik yaa vikaas sambandhi kaaryon ko rajya ke liye athwa uski ore se chalaati he
 It has its own fund and is partially autonomous in internal affairs of the system
 is prakaar ke santhaan ke liye vibhinn naam prayukt hue hai, yatha-government karporation, stacutari karporation, kwasi governmental baris ityadi
 But the public institution is now commonly used
 england main rajya dwaara taksaal or dak vyavastha par niyantran ho jane par bhi kaaphi samay tak saarvajanik santhaan kaa vichaar na punap sakaa
 Later the work of police, education, lighting etc
 by the autonomous governance departments of the state established with limited powers developed that idea
 nirdhan logon kii sahaayta ke liye pur laaj paarit hue
 Commissioners appointed for this were empowered to work in local administration independent of state control
 kintu rashtriyakrut udyogon or upyogita sevaaon ke liye saarvajanik niyantran 1945 se hi sambhav ho sakaa
 Apart from local institutions, autonomous institutions in India emerged from "the Trustees of the Port of Bombay" established in 1879
 baad main aisi hi sanvidhik sansthaayen kalakatta or madras ke bandargahon par baniin
 In 1935, there was a plan to hand over railway control to the Public Institute by the Government of India Act
 is santhaan ko "fedral railway atharity' kaha gaya, kintu adhinium ke purnat: lagu na hone se yah yojana kriyanvit na hui
 It is possible that the UK had established public institutions in India to meet the demand for autonomous power and to remove the blame for running a centralized government
 pratham vishwayuddh ke baad kai aise sansthaanon kii sthapana karnaa, kapaas, lakh, nariyal aadi ke krishi vikaas, vastu nirmaan or vikray ke uddeshy se kendriya adhinium ke antargat hui
 Due to the variation of functions and objectives, the legal classification of public institutions has not been done
 freedman ke vargeekaran ko ugrai singh ne sanvardhit karne kii cheshtaa kii, kintu suvidha kii drushti se nimnaankit vargeekaran diya ja rahaa he: 1
 Banking Institute 2
 vaanijya santhaan 3

 Social Service Institute 6
 vittiya sahaayta santhaan The problems of system and governance arising from nationalization can be solved conveniently by public institutions
 ye saarvajanik sevaaon ko raajnneetik uhapohon se mukt rakhte hai
 Even the bureaucratic tradition that blocks the desired work and courage of social and commerce related services does not thrive due to its being flexible and autonomous

 Similarly, these posts should not be given to secretaries or other officers also
 santhaan ke adhyaksh pad ke liye aise vyakti niyukt kiye jaaen jo puraa samay usee ko de saken
 The committee also suggested that institute service should be created whose members should be at the will of the President
 sansthaanon kii poonji yaa to sarkaar dwaara, yaa share bechney se, yaa exise kar, shulk ityadi se praapt hoti he
 These institutions can also take loans
 vaanijya santhaan vaanijya siddhanton par chalate hai
 They declare their dividends or accumulate reserves
 sansthaanon or mantri ke bich ke sambandh bhi mahatvapurn hote hai
 Although the Minister has no responsibility in day-to-day affairs, the case of Mundra suggests that in a critical situation, the Minister is also legally responsible for day-to-day affairs
 vade kaa suzav to yah he ki sansthaanon ko kaaryakarini kaa hi ek ang maan lenaa chahie
 The minister appoints the president and other members of the institute
 vah unhen kaaryamukt bhi kar saktaa he
 The powers to dismantle the institution also vest in the Minister

 Questions can be raised regarding institutions in Parliament
 unke vaarshik vivaran, prativedan par bahes ho sakati he
 Some institutions also have to present their budget in Parliament
 sansad kii estimets or public accounts cametiyaan bhi sansthaanon par niyantran rakhti hai, kintu unki apni simaaon ke kaaran aajkal santhaan kaaryon ke liye ek bhinn sansadeey samiti banane kaa prastaav bhi vichaaradhin he

 In fact, it is a fracture in the upper layer of the Earth through which the internal matter comes out
 jwalamukhi dwaara nicksruth in padaarthon ke jamaa ho jane se nirmit shankvakar sthalaroop ko jwalamukhi parvat kaha jaataa he
 Volcanoes are related to plate tectonics because it has been found that they are often found on the boundaries of plates because plate boundaries provide weak sites for fractures in the Earth's upper crust

 These are again classified into several types depending on the intensity of the explosion: is prakaar ke udbhedan main lava ke saath gas kii maatra kam hoti he jisase lava daraaron main hokar dhraraatal par jamane lagata he
 Sometimes due to the accumulation of large amounts of lava, a thick layer is formed, which results in the formation of lava plains or lava plateaus

 For this reason, the army demanded a rifle and cartridge that also has the qualities of submachine and it works within a radius of 300 meters

 The specialty of the Kalashnikov rifle has been the simple design, the small size and the ease of mass production, Mikhail Kalashnikov has always denied that his rifle is a copy of the German STG 44, although all the evidence is his Against this, we can consider this rifle to be a mixture of all previous rifle technicians, its locking design is derived from the M1 Grand Rifle, its trigger and safety folk ramming Neither the rifle is taken from model 8, while the gas system and exterior design is derived from the STG 44, Kalashnikov's team had access to all these weapons and thus did not need to re-invent the wheel , He himself believed that before inventing anything one should study everything present in that area and i myself have experienced this thing

 In cryptography, encryption is a process of converting information with the help of an algorithm
 yah prakriya jaankaree ko keval un logon ke padhane yogya bana detii he, jinhen kunjee naam kii vishesh jaankaree praapt he
 The result of this process gives us encrypted information
 In many contexts, the term encryption also refers to a reverse process, called decryption
 This makes the encrypted information readable again

 Encryption is now used to protect information in many common civil systems

 Encryption can be used to protect saved data, such as files kept on computers and storage devices
 In recent years, there have been numerous reports of confidential data such as personal records of customers being exposed due to lost or stolen laptops or back-up devices
 aisi filon kii ancrypting karne se ham unhen bhautik suraksha upaay vifal ho jane par bhi surakshit rakh sakate hai
 Digital rights management systems that prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted material and protect the software against reverse engineering are also some slightly different examples of using encryption on saved data

 However, encryption products are not suitable in all cases for some reasons
 First of all, for some governmental purposes, it should be digitally signed at the time of creating an e-mail to end the disclaimer, otherwise the sender may argue that the e-mail after it is sent from the computer and before it reaches the encrypted gateway Has been tampered with

 Duryodhana again became angry with mourning
 us samay karn uski sena kaa karnadhaar hua
 The Pandava-army gained the dominance of Arjuna
 karn or arjuna main bhanti-bhanti ke astr-shastron kii maar-kaat se yukt mahabhayanak yuddh hua, jo devasur-sangram ko bhi maat karne vaala tha
 In the battle of Karna and Arjuna, Karna killed many of the enemies of the enemy side with his arrows; Before the seventeenth day, Karna fought with all the Pandavas except Arjuna
 usne mahabali bhim sahit in pandavon ko ek-par-ek ran main parrast bhi kiya tha
 But as promised to Mata Kunti, she did not kill any Pandavas
 satrahawein din ke yuddh main aakhirkaar vah ghadi aa hi gai, jab karn or arjuna aamane-saamne aa gaye
 Both were equal in this magnificent struggle
 karn ko uske guru parashuram dwaara vijay naamak dhanush bhent swaroop diya gaya tha, jiskaa praturup swayan vishwakarma ne banaaya tha
 On the request of Duryodhana, the maternal uncle of the Pandavas agreed to become the charioteer of Shalya Karna
 darasal arjuna ke sarathi swayan shrikrishna the or karn kisi bhi maamle main arjuna se kam naa ho iske liye shalya se sarathi banane kaa nivedan kiya gaya, kyonki unke andar ve sabhi gun the jo ek yogya sarathi main hone chahie
 During the battle, Arjuna's arrows hit Karna's chariot and his chariot slips back several yards
 lekin, jab karn ke baan arjuna ke rath par lage to uskaa rath keval kuch hi baalist dur khiskaa
 On this, Shri Krishna praised Karna
 is baat par chakit hokar arjuna ne karn kii is prashansa kaa kaaran poocha, kyonki uske baan rath ko peeche khiskaane main adhik prabhaavshaalee the
 Then Krishna said that Karna's chariot has only the weight of Karna and Surgical, but Arjuna's chariot himself and Hanuman are seated and even then Karna pushed his chariot back a few times
 isi prakaar karn ne kai baar arjuna ke dhanush kii pratyancha kaat di
 But every time Arjun would blink the bow immediately
 iske liye karn arjuna kii prashansa karata he or shalya se kahata he ki vah ab samajha ki kyon arjuna ko sarvshereshth dhanurdhar kaha jaataa he
 Karna and Arjun fought a long and fierce battle, making full use of their knowledge of wielding divine weapons
 karn dwaara arjuna kaa sir dhad se alag karne ke liye "nagastra" kaa prayog kiya gaya
 But at the right time by Sri Krishna, the chariot was sunk a little in the ground, which saved Arjuna
 isse "nagastra" arjuna ke sir ke thik upar se uske mukut ko chhedta hua nikal gaya
 Ashwaseena Nag, who was present on Nagastra, requested Karna to use the weapon again so that this time it would come out piercing Arjuna's body, but Karna obeyed the promise given to Mata Kunti by refusing to reuse that weapon
 gives
 dharti main dhanse apane rath ke pahie ko nikaalata karn
 Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paata he, jaisaa kii uske guru parashuram kaa shraap tha
 Then Karna comes down to take off the wheel of his chariot and pleads with Arjuna that he should stop running arrows for a while, following the rules of war
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna se kehete hai ki karn ko koi adhikaar nahin he ki vah ab yuddh niyamon or dharm kii baat kare, jabaki swayan usne bhi abhimanyu vadh ke samay kisi bhi yuddh niyam or dharm kaa paalan nahin kiya tha
 He further said where his religion had gone when he called the divine-born Draupadi as a prostitute in front of the entire Kuru Rajya Sabha
 dhyut-krida bhawan main uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha
 So now he has no right to talk about any religion or war rules and he told Arjuna that Karna is helpless now so he should kill him
 shrikrishna kehete hai ki yadi arjuna ne is nirnaayak mode par abhi karn ko nahin maaraa to sambhawatah pandav use kabhi bhi nahin maar sakenge or yah yuddh kabhi bhi nahin jeeta ja sakegaa
 Then, Arjuna beheaded Karna using a divine weapon
 karn ke sharir ke bhoomi par girane ke baad ek jyoti karn ke sharir se nikali or surya main samahit ho gai
 Sri Krishna then tells Arjuna that Karna has no right to talk about war rules and religion, whereas he himself did not follow any war rules and religion at the time of Abhimanyu slaughter
 unhone aage kaha ki tab uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha jab usne divya-janma draupadi ko puri kuru rajsabha ke samaksh vaishya kaha tha
 Where did his religion go in the sports hall? isliye ab use koi adhikaar nahin kii vah kisi dharm yaa yuddh niyam kii baat kare or unhone arjuna se kaha ki abhi karn asahaay he isliye vah uskaa vadh kare

 During the siege of Lucknow at the time of this rebellion, Sikandar Bagh, a place of refuge of about 2000 Indian soldiers, was attacked by the British forces and on 16 November 1857, these 2000 Indian soldiers who took refuge in the garden were killed by the British forces

 The Home Rule Movement was the All India Home Rule League, a national political organization founded in 1916 by Bal Gangadhar Tilak with the name of "home Rule" to lead the national demand for self-government in India
 bharat ko british raaj main ek dominian kaa darja praapt karne ke liye aisa kiya gaya tha
 Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland were established as Dominions within the British Empire at that time
 pratham vishwayuddh kii armbh hone par bhartiya rashtriya congress ke narampanthiyon ne britain kii sahaayta karne kaa nishchay kiya
 The reason behind this decision of the Indian National Congress was that if India would help Britain, after the war Britain would make India independent
 parantu sheeghra hi bhartiya rashtriya congress ko ye anumaan ho gaya ki britain aisa kadaapi nahin karegaa or isliye bhartiya netaa asantusht hokar koi doosraa maarg khojane lage
 This dissatisfaction became the reason for the birth of the Home Rule Movement
 1915 i
 se 1916 i
 ke madhya do home rule ligon kii sthapana hui
 'pune Home Rule League' was founded by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and 'madras Home Rule League' was founded by Annie Besant
 home rule lig bhartiya rashtriya congress kii sahaayak sanstha kii bhaanti karyrat ho gayi
 The purpose of this movement was the attainment of self-state, but the use of weapons was not allowed in this movement
 home rule aandolan ke dauraan bal gangadhar tilak or ani besent ne 1917 main ek dhvaj banaaya
 Five red and four green stripes were made on this flag
 saat taron ko bhi is par ankit kiya gaya tha, kintu yah dhvaj logon ke bich zyada prasiddh nahin hua
 In 1920, the All India Home Rule League elected Mahatma Gandhi as its president
 ek varsh main ye sanghathan ek sanyukt bhartiya raajnneetik morche ke liye bhartiya rashtriya congress main vilay ho gaya or iskaa swayan kaa astitv khatm ho gaya
 Mrs
 Anne Besant was a resident of Ireland
 ve bharat main thiosophical sosayadi kii sanchalika thi
 She was very influenced by Indian civilization and culture
 isliye ireland ko chhodkar vah bharat main bas gai thim or bharat ko apni mathrubhumi maanane lag gai thi
 At this time, the Home Rule League was established in Ireland under the leadership of the Irish leader Redmond, who wanted to achieve home rule and self-government for Ireland by statutory and peaceful measures
 1913 main jab eni bessent england gayi to ireland kii homerul lig ne unako suzav diya ki bharat ko swatantra karaane ke liye homerul aandolan prarambh karen
 Mrs
 Anne Besant wanted to give India the same kind of swaraj as it had in other colonies of the British Empire, ie, was desirous of giving India dominion status
 isi uddeshy se bharat lautne par congress main shaamil huin or udaarvaadiyon tathaa ugravadiyon ko ektabaddh kar homerul aandolan chalaaya
 The Home Rule Movement was a statutory movement
 is aandolan ke pramukh uddeshy nimnlikhit the- Bal Gangadhar Tilak left from prison on 16 June 1914 after serving a long sentence of six years
 kaid kaa adhikansh samay mandle main beetaa tha
 When he returned to India, he felt that the country he had left had changed a lot
 swadeshi aandolan ke krantikari netaa aravind ghosh ne sanyas le liya tathaa pandicherry main rahane lage the
 Lala Lajpat Rai was in America
 bhartiya rashtriya congress surat ke vibhaajan, aandolankariyon par angrejon ke damankaaree praharon or 1909ke sanvaidhanik sudhaaron ke kaaran narampanthi rashtravaadiyon kii niraashaa ke sammilit sadame se abhi ubar nahin pai thi
 Tilak thought that first of all Congress and other extremists should be included in it
 tilak ko yah vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki bhartiya rashtriya congress, bhartiya rashtriya aandolan kaa paryaay ban chuki he or bina isaki ijaajat ke koi bhi rashtriya aandolan safal nahin ho saktaa
 With a view to persuade moderates, to win their trust and not to suppress the British rule in future, he declared "I say very clearly that we want to improve the governance system in India as in Ireland There are demanding agitators there
 angreji hukumat ko ukhaad phenkane kaa hamaara koi iraadaa nahin he
 i have no hesitation in saying that the violent incidents which have taken place in different parts of India are not only contrary to my ideology, but because of them also slowed down the process of our political development
 ’’ unhone angreji hukumat ke prati apni nishtha doharaai or bhartiya janata se apil kii ki vah sankat kii ghadi main angreji hukumat kaa saath de
 All the leaders of the moderate camp now realized that what they did in Surat in 1907 was wrong
 ye congress kii akarmanyata se bhi kshubdh the
 Tilak's appeal to him was very good
 iske alaava in par eni bessent kaa lagaataar dabaav pad rahaa tha ki desh main rashtravaadi raajnneetik aandolan ko phir se tej karo
 Anne Besant had recently joined the Congress
 1914 main vah 66 varsh kii thi, unke raajnneetik jivan kii shuruyaat england main hui thi jahaan unhone swatantra chintan ugr sudhaarwad fabianwaad or brahmavidya ke prachaar main hissaa liya
 In 1893 she came to India, the aim was to work for the Theosophical Society
 unhone madras ke ek upnagar audiar main apana daftar kholaa or 1907 main thiosaphy kaa prachaar karne lagi
 Within a short time he gained a large number of supporters
 jinamein zyaadaatar un samudaayon ke shikshit vyakti shaamil hue the, jinamein abhi tak saanskrithik punarjagran nahin hua tha
 In 1914 Anne Besant decided to expand the scope of her activities and planned a movement to demand self-government in India, like the Home Rule League of Ireland
 unhen laga ki iske liye congress kii anumati or garampanthi aandolankariyon kaa sahyog lenaa jaruri he
 To get the support of the extremists, it was necessary to include them in the Congress
 eni bessent congress ke garampanthi netaaon ko samajhane lagi ki ve tilak va uske garampanthi sahyogiyon ko congress main shaamil hone kii ijaajat de de
 But the Congress session of 1914 dented his efforts
 firozshah mehta or bombay ke unke narampanthi samarthakon ne gokhale or bengal ke narampanthiyon ko, garampanthiyon ko baahar rakhane ke liye manaa liya
 After this, Tilak and Anne Besant decided to run a political movement on their own and at the same time they continued to pressurize the Congress to make the extremists their members again
 1915 ke shuru main eni bessent ne do akhabaaron ‘new india’ or ‘kaaman vil’ ke madhyam se aandolan ched diya
 Organized public meetings and conferences
 unki maang thi ki jis tarah se gore upniveshon main vahaan kii janata ko apni sarkaar banane kaa adhikaar diya gaya he, bharatiya janata ko bhi swashaasan kaa adhikaar mili
 After April 1915, Anne Besant took an even tougher and combative attitude
 isi bich lokmaanya tilak ne apni raajnneetik gatividhiyaan shuru kar di
 But he was very cautious that the moderate faction of the Congress should not be angry or the Congress should not feel that Tilak's activities did not match with the Congress policy
 unki dili khwaahish congress main kisi tarah shaamil hone kii thi
 Tilak convened a conference of his supporters in Poona in 1915, in which it was decided that an institution be formed to familiarize the rural masses with the objectives and activities of the Congress
 is faisle ke baad usee varsh agast or sitambar main maharashtra ke vibhinn nagaron main jo sthaneey sanghathan bane, ve raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko tej karne ke bajaay sari urja congress main ekta sthapit karne ke liye kharch karte rahe
 He continued to insist that unity in the Congress is very important for any national movement
 narampanthi congress ke kuch roodhiwaadiyon par dabaav daalane ke liye tilak ne kabhi-kabhi dhamkee kaa bhi sahaara liya, par unhen vishwaas tha ki adhiktar narampanthi netaaon ko vah samajha-bujhaakar manaa lenge
 The annual Congress session was held in December 1915 and the efforts of Tilak and Anne Besant succeeded
 garampanthiyon ko congress main waapas lene kaa faisla kiya gaya
 The opposition of Bombay moderates proved ineffective after the death of Ferozeshah Mehta
 gokhale kaa nidhan ho chukaa tha
 Anne Besant was successful in bringing the extremists to the Congress, but could not get the approval of the Congress and the Muslim League on her proposal for the formation of the Home Rule League
 lekin sthaneey str par congress samitiyon ko punerjeevit karne ke liye prachaar kaaryon ke unke prastaavon ko congress ne maan liya lekin unhen us samay kii congress kaa charitra or uski takat kaa pataa tha
 She knew that the Congress had approved these programs, but it would not implement it
 isliye unhone apane prastaav ke saath yah shart bhi rakhi thi ki yadi sitambar 1916 tak congress in kaaryakramon par amal nahin karegi to vah khud apana sanghathan bana legi
 Tilak got the right to return to Congress and did not make any promise to Congress, so he announced the formation of the 'homerule League' at the provincial conference in Belgaum in April 1916
 ani bessent ke samarthak bhi ab kasmasaane lage
 They were not ready to wait until September
 unhone ani bessent par dabaav daalkar homerul group kii sthapana karne kii ijaajat le lee
 Jamnadas Dwarkadas, Shankarlal Baker and Indulal Yagnik started a newspaper 'young India' in Bombay and started collecting funds from all corners of the country to bring out papers in English and regional language
 ani bessent ne sitambar tak intjaar kiya
 The Congress was completely inactive
 unhonen bhi homerul lig kii sthapana kii ghoshnaa kar di or apane samarthak george arundell ko sanghathan sachiv niyukt kiya
 Tilak and Annie Besant also divided the work areas for their respective leagues, so that there is no mess
 tilak kii lig karnataka, maharashtra, madhyaprant or baraar kii jimmevary thi
 The rest of the country was responsible for the league of Anne Besant
 in donon ne apana vilay nahin kiya
 The reason was that some of Annie Besant's supporters did not like Tilak and some of Tilak's supporters Annie Besant, but there was no quarrel between them
 tilak ne maharashtra kaa daura kiya
 Preached the Homeroom movement a lot
 janata ko samajhaayaa ki isaki jarurat kyon he, iske uddeshy kya hai
 In his words, "india is like a son who is young
" samay kaa takaza he ki baap yaa paalak is bete ko uskaa vaazib haq de de
 The Indian public must now take the rights
 unhen iskaa puraa adhikaar he
 "tilak linked the demand of education and linguistic states in the regional language with the demand of 'swaraj'
 unhonen kaha ‘‘marathi, telugu, kannada tathaa anya bhashaaon ke aadhaar par praanton ke gathan kii maang kaa arth hi he shiksha kaa madhyam kshetray bhashaa ho
 Do the British teach French to their people here
 kya german apane logon kii angreji main shiksha dete he yaa turk french main shiksha dete he
 At the provincial conference of Bombay in 1915, Tilak proposed a condolence on Gokhale's death
 bi
bi
 alur iskaa samarthan karne ke liye jaise hi khadey hue tilak ne kaha ‘‘kannada bhashaa kaa adhikaar jataane ke liye kannada main bolie
 "this shows that Tilak Kshetraya was not Marathi parochialism
" chuaachhut or gaiyr brahmanon ke maamalon me tilak jativaadee nahin the
 non-brahmins of Maharashtra once sent a separate memorandum to the government that they had nothing to do with the demands of the upper classes
 to kai logon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 But Tilak explained to these protesters, you guys should be patient
 yadi ham unhen yah samajha saken ki ham unke saath hai or unki maang tathaa hamaari maangon me koi fark nahin he, to mujhe pakkaa vishwaas he ki asamanta mitaane ke liye chhidaa unka aandolan hamaare sangharsh se jud jayega’’ unhone gaiyr brahmanon ko samajhaayaa ki jhagada brahmanon or gaiyr-brahmanon kaa nahin he bhed shikshit or ashikshit ke bich he
 Is more educated than Brahmins and non-brahmins
 isliye gaiyr-brahmanon kii vakaalat karanevaali sarkaar bhi majaboor hokar sarkari naukariyon main brahmanon ko hi bharti karti he
 The government, despite its autocratic attitude towards the Brahmins, is giving them a place in the administration because it believes that only educated people can run the administration
 chuaachhut unmoolan ke liye yojit ek sammelan main tilak ne kaha tha, ‘‘yadi bhagwaan bhi chuaachhut ko bardaasht karen, to main bhagwaan ko nahin maanunga
 '' tilak ke us samay die gaye bhaashanon main kahin se bhi dharmik apil nahin jhalkati
 The demand for home rule was completely based on secularism
 tilak kaa kahana tha ki angrejon se virodh kaa kaaran yah nahin he ki vah kisi duusare dharm ke anuyaayi he, unka virodh to ham isliye karte he kyonki ve bhartiya janata ke hit main koi kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 In the words of Tilak, "english or Muslim, if he works for the benefit of the people of this country, then he is not alien to us
" is paraepan kaa dharm yaa vyavsaay se koi rishta nahin he
 This is a question directly related to interests
 tilak ne chah marathi tathaa do angreji parache nikaal kar apane prachaar kaary ko or tej kar diya
 47 thousand slips of these leaflets were sold
 baad me in parchon ko gujarati or kannada bhashaa me chapa gaya
 Six branches of the league were formed
 madhya maharashtra bombay nagar, karnataka or madhyaprant main ek-ek tathaa baraar main do
 As the Homerul movement started gaining momentum, the government intensified the repressive action
 is aandolan par waar karne ke liye sarkaar ne ek vishesh din chunaa
 23 July 1916 was Tilak's 60th birthday
 ek bade sabha kaa aayojan kiya gaya or tilak ko ek lakh rupye kii thili bhent kii gai
 The government gave him a second reward on the occasion
 unhen ek kaaran bataao notice diya gaya
 In which it was written that why should you not be banned due to your activities
 unhen saath hajaar rupye kaa muchalaka bharne ko kaha gaya
 Perhaps the most important gift was for Tilak
 unhonen kaha, ‘‘ab homerul aandolan jangal main aag kii tarah failega
 Government repression will provoke the insurgency
 ’’ An entire team of lawyers led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah fought on behalf of Tilak
 magistrate kii adaalat main to tilak mukaddama haar gaye par navambar main unhen hoicourt ne nirdaash qaraar diy
 This victory was appreciated by all
 gandhi ne ‘yang-india’ akhbaar main likhaa, ‘‘yah abhivyakti kii aazaadee kii bahut badi jeet he
 Homerule is a great success for the movement
 ’’ is avasar kaa tilak ne phayda uthaaya or apane saarvajanik bhaashanon main kehane lage ki homerul yaa swashaasan kii maang vyakt karne ke liye sarkaar ne anumati de di he
 Tilak and his associates expedited the campaign and by April 1917 they had made 14 thousand members
 ani bessent kii lig ne bhi sitambar 1916 se kaam karnaa shuru kar diya par unka sanghathan bahut dhilaa tha
 Any three persons could open a branch anywhere, whereas the organization of the League of Tilak was very strong, the work and work of all the six branches were scheduled to take place
 ani bessent kii lig kii do sau shakhaayen thim
 Many branches were in towns and cities, in other villages, a few villages came under one branch
 haalanki kaaryakari parishad kaa chunaav kiya jaataa tha lekin sara kaam ani bessent or unke sahyogi arudel, si

 There was no organized way of instructing the members
 yaa to vyaktigat rup se sadasyon ko nirdesh die jate the yaa phir new india main arudel ke lekhon kaa padhakar log jaanate the ki unhen kya karnaa he
 Annie Besant's league lagged behind member in comparison to Tilak's league
 march 1917 tak unki lig ke sadasyon kii sankhya keval 7000 thi
 Jawaharlal Nehru, B
 Chakraborty and J
C
 Banerjee also joined it
 philhal shakhaon kii ginati se lig kii takat kaa anumaan lagaana kathin he, kyonki inamen se kuch to kaaphi sakriy bhi or kuch niskriy, kyonki ve zyaadaatar ‘theosophical sosayadi’ kii gatividhiyon tak simit thi
 As an example, Madras city had the largest number of branches, but branches in the cities of Bombay, Uttar Pradesh and rural areas of Gujarat were quite active
 haalanki inaki sankhya kaaphi kam thi
 a quantum goal of all these activities was to launch a large-scale movement to demand homerul
 iske liye raajnneetik shiksha dena or raajnneetik bahes chhedana bahut jaruri tha
 Through 'new India', Arudel raised political debate, set up libraries providing information about national politics to his supporters, organized classes to impart political education to students, argued among friends in support of 'homerul' and He asked to work for participation in the movement
 kai shakhaon ne in par amal kiya
 Particular attention paid to political debate
 homerul kaa prachaar kitna tej hua iskaa andaaj isi tathy se laga sakate hai ki sitambar 1916 tak prachaar fund se chaape janevaale teen lakh parche baante ja chuke the
 This publicity fund was established a few months ago
 in parachon main tatkaaleen sarkaar kaa kaccha chittha hota tha or swaraj ke samarthan main tark die jate the
 After the establishment of the League of Anne Besant, these leaflets were printed again
 kai kshetray bhashaaon main bhi inkaa prakaashan hua
 Simultaneously, the order of public meetings and speeches continued
 jab bhi kisi mudde ko lekar deshvyapee pratirodh kaa aahvaan kiya jaataa tha, lig kii sari shakhaayen iskaa samarthan karti
 In November 1916, when Annie Besant was banned from moving to Berar and Central Provinces, on Arudel's appeal, all branches of the League organized protest meetings and sent protest proposals to the Viceroy and the Home Secretary
 isi tarah 1917 main jab tilak par punjab or dilli jane par pratibandh lagaaya gaya to puure desh main virodh baithken huin
 All branches of the League strongly opposed it
 kaan gres kii akarmanyata se kshubdh anek narampanthi kaan greysi bhi homerul aandolan main shaamil ho gaye
 Gokhale's 'servant of India Society' was not allowed to become a member of the League, but he supported the 'homerul Movement' by giving speeches and publicizing it among the public
 uttarapradesh main anek narampanthi rashtravaadiyon ne congress sammelan kii taiyaari ke silsile main homerul lig ke kaaryakrttaaon ke saath gaan wo, kasbon kaa daura kiya
 Most of their meetings took place in the libraries of local courts, where students, businessmen and people from other professions would gather
 or agar baithak kisi bazaar ke din hoti to isamen gaan von se aae kisaan bhi shariq hote
 In these meetings, the issue of poverty and disorder of India would be raised
 ateet kii samruththi kii yaad dilaai jaati or you rope ke swatantrata aandolan par prakaash daalaa jaataa, usase prerana lene kii apil kii jaati
 Hindi was used in these meetings
 narampanthiyon kaa home rule lig ko samarthan dena koi achraj kii baat nahin thim kyon ki lig narampanthiyon ke raajnneetik prachaar va shaiksh nik kaaryakramon ko hi amali jama pahana rahi thi
 The Lucknow session of the Congress in 1916 was a good opportunity for the members of the Home Rule League to show their strength
 tilak ke samarthakon ne to ek parampara hi bana di jis par congress bahut saal tak tiki rahi
 His supporters reserved a train to reach Lucknow, which some called 'congress Special', while some called 'homeroom Special'
 arudel ne lig ke har sadsy se kaha tha ki vah lakhanu adhiveshan kaa sadsy banane kii har sambhav koshish karen
 Tilak was again included in the Congress at the Lucknow Congress session
 adhyaksh ambikacharan majumdaar ne kaha- In this session, the important 'grace League' agreement, which is known as "lucknow Pact", was signed
 is samjhaute me ani bessent or tilak ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Many senior leaders including Madan Mohan Malaviya were totally against it
 unka aarope tha ki yah samjhauta muslim lig ko bahut tavajjo detaa he
 Tilak said on this charge, "there is an allegation by some great personalities that Hindus are giving more importance to their Muslim brothers
 main kahata hoon ki yadi swashaasan kaa adhikaar keval muslim samudaay ko diya jaae to mujhe koi etraj nahin hoga, rajdooton ko yah adhikaar mili to parvaah nahin, hindustan ne kisi bhi samudaay ko yah adhikaar de diya jaae hamen koi aitraaj nahi
 This statement of mine represents the national spirit of Samu Chi
 jab bhi aap kisi teesri party se lard rahe hote hai, to sabase jaruri hoti he, aapasi ekta, jaateey ekta, dharmik ekta or vibhinn raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon kii ekta
 '' tilak ko bahut adhik roodhiwaadee hindu mana jaataa tha
 He was a brilliant scholar of Indian oriental learning
 jab unhone is tarah kaa bayaan diya, to kisi or kaa virodh karne kii himmat nahin hui
 However, it was controversial for Muslims to accept the principle of separate constituencies
 lekin yah isliye sweekaar kiya gaya ki yahi alpsankhyakon ko yah na lage ki bahusankhyak un par prabhutv sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 The Lucknow session raised the demand for constitutional reforms again
 sadasyon kaa maananaa tha ki swarajya ke lakshya kii prapti main yah maang sahaayak hogi
 Although this demand did not include all those things, as the members of the Home Rule League wanted, they did not raise any dispute on this
 ve har haal main congress main ekta banaae rakhana chaahate the
 Tilak made another proposal that an executive committee should be formed to give realization to the decisions and programs of the Congress session
 par narampanthiyon ke virodh ke kaaran yah prastaav manjuur na ho sakaa
 In fact, Tilak wanted the Congress not to remain idle, to do a little more work
 tilak kaa prastaav to manjuur na ho paaya, par chaar saal baad jab 1920 main mahatma gandhi ne kanges samvidhan ko sanshodhit kar use nayaa rup diya-ek aisa swaroop jo kisi aandolan ko lambe samay tak chalaane ke liye jaruri tha-to unhonen bhi tilak ke isi prastaav ko maananaa jaruri samajha
 Soon after the conclusion of the Congress session, both the Home Rule Leagues met in the same pandal
 jisamen lagbhag ek hajaar pratinidhiyon ne bhaag liya
 The Congress League agreement was appreciated and Tilak and Annie Besant addressed the meeting
 lakhanu se lautate samay in donon netaaon ne uttar, madhya or purvi bharat ke anek kshetron kaa daura kiya
 It was natural for the government to be concerned about the increasing influence of the Home Rule movement
 madras sarkaar jaraa zyada hi kathor ho gai
 He banned students from attending political meetings
 puure pradesh main iskaa virodh hua
 Tilak said, "the government knows that the feeling of patriotism makes students more excited
 vaise bhi koi bhi desh yuva varg kii takat se hi unnati kar saktaa he
 The Government of Madras in June 1917, Annie Besant, George Arudel and V

 The proposal was sent to all Provincial Congress committees for approval
 baraar va madras kii congress samitiyaan to is par turant kaarywahi ke paksh main thim, lekin baaki samitiyaan koi nirnay karne se pehle thodaa intjaar karne ke paksh main thim
 At Gandhiji's behest, Shankarlal Backer and Jamnadas Dwarkaprasad assembled the signatures of a thousand people who wanted to meet Annie Besant in disguise of government orders

 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc

This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa

 The reason for this is that matter deteriorates due to the movement of Prabhrash
