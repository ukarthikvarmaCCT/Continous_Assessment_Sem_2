 The Commonwealth Prajabhoomi or Commonwealth Territories, known in English as the Commonwealth Realm, are said to be the 16 universal nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, ruled by the same ruler, Queen Elizabeth II
 ye saare desh ek hi rajasatta, shaasha, rajpariwaar or uttaradhikaar kram ko saanjhaa karte hai
 The system began with the Statute of Westminster of 1931, by which the then Dominion of Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were granted equal or complete legal independence with equal members of the British Commonwealth
 She had gone
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad se, vishwa bhar main vistrut, british samrajya ke tamaam deshon ko ek dominian ke rup main swadhinata pradaan kar di gayi
 Some of which, despite being completely independent, maintained their loyalty to the monarchy, while some states refused to consider the British monarchy as the nominal head and declared themselves a republican state
 aaj, vishwa baahar main kul 16 aise rajya hai jo swayan ko maharani elizabeth dwitiya ke ek prajabhumi ke rup main pahchaan karavvate hai
 Under the British sovereign in the English language, these states are commonly known as Rialm, which is derived from the French word royum, a realme, a state, territory or territory over which a king / queen rules
 yahan yah jaananaa aavashyak he kii, united kingdom yaa rashtramandal yaa kisi bhi rashtramandal pradesh kii aadhikarik shabdaawalee main "realm" ek vaidhik yaa kanoonee shabd nahin he, arthath "realm" kii koi kanoonee paribhaasha nahin he
 Therefore, there is no obligation that these states under the British sovereign be addressed by any special name, nor does the term "realm" define any particular status of a state
 haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because, Canada and Australia are federal nations, so each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Acts of Settlement of 1701, only the "legitimate" Protostant descendants of Sophia, the granddaughter of James I, the granddaughter of Hanover, were able to inherit the throne
 arthath, shahi parivaar ke vansh ke keval jaays santan hi singhasana par uttaradhikaar kaa haq rakhte hai, or koi bhi avaidh santan, tathaa unke vanshaj, singhasana par kisi bhi prakaar kaa adhikaar nahin rakhte hai
 In this context, according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act, 1772, any member of the royal family is required to obtain the sovereign's approval to marry, and any marriage done without the sovereign's approval shall be deemed "illegal", and The person and his children will be deprived of authority over the throne
 is adhinium ke praavdhaanon main 2013 ke saxeshan tu da crown act dwaara kuch parivartan laaye gaye
 According to the Act, the first six members of the succession order are required to obtain sovereign permission to marry, otherwise the person and all the progeny and descendants of that marriage will be deemed to be deprived of the succession order
 parantu aisi kisi bhi vivaah ko kisi bhi prakaar se gaiyr-kanoonee nahin qaraar ja saktaa he
 The group of the closest members of the sovereign's family is called the royal family
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhaan nahin he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Nonetheless, those individuals to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness are generally referred to are members of the royal family
 is maapdand ke aadhaar par raaj parivaar main, adhirat, unke / unki sahachaari, purv samprabhu kii vidhwaa / vidhurgan, wales ke rajkumaar ke jyeshthatam putr ke santan, tathaa purv shaasha ke putron kii dharmapatniyaan yaa unki vidhwaayen or unke purush-rekha ke pautra shaamil honge
 In the context of different Commonwealth territories, different terminology can also be used for this particular group, for example, in Australia this group is called the Australian Royal Family and in Canada the Canadian Royal Family
 18 veen or 19veen sadi ke dauraan britain ke aupniveshik vistaar dwaara, britain ne vishwa ke anya anek bhu-bhaagon ve kshetron par apana kabza jamaa liya
 Most of the countries achieved independence from Britain by the mid-20th century
 haalaanki un sabhi deshon ne united kingdom kii sarkaar kii adhipatyata ko nakaar diya, parantu unamem se kai raashtra, british shaasha ko apane adhirat ke rup main manyata dete hai
 These countries are called Commonwealth Territories or Commonwealth Praja Bhumi
 varttman kaal main, united kingdom ke adhirat keval united kingdom ke hi nahin balki uske atirikt kul 15 anya rashtron ke adhirat bhi hai
 Although in these nations also they have almost the same rank and authority as in Britain, but in those countries, they have no real political or traditional duties, almost all the duties of the ruler as their representative fulfills the General Manager of that country
 
 britain kii sarkaar kaa rashtramandal pradeshon kii sarkaron ke kaary main koi bhi bhoomika yaa hastkshep nahin he
 Commonwealth countries other than Britain: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, St
 Lucia, St
 Kitts and Nevis, St
 Vincent and the Grenadines and Tuvalu Are included

 isse sharir dwaara banaaye gaye afl vifaille tatwon ko baahar nikaalane evam kshay ho rahi urja ke punarsanchay main madad milti he
 Ozone in medical science was used in the early 19th century
 america main vaidhanik rup main iskaa prayog 1920 or 1930 ke dashak main prayog shuru hua tha
 Ozone is used in many countries like Germany, Italy, France, Russia and Latin American countries Brazil, Mexico, Cuba and Asian country Malaysia

 In 1980, a test conducted on nearly four lakh people showed its side effects on only 40 people, which proves that it is almost completely safe
 cancer ke rogiyon ke liye ozon therapy ek dard rahit upachaar hota he

 aisa karne se khaansee, ulti yaa ubakaai kii samasya ho sakati he
 This therapy is also very inexpensive
 chikitsak varg or jaivarasyanagyon sahit kai logon kaa ye vichaar he ki ozone main ullekhneey swasthyavardhak gun hote hai
 Many others have also argued against it, that this fact is unscientific and has no proven benefit
 kai varshon tak ozone ke chikitsakeey gun yaa avagunon kii charchaa vivaad kaa vishay rahe hai
 With the advent of medical ozone-generating generators, recent studies of ozone toxicity assessment, methods and related actions have been made possible through clinical experiments
 ozone main carbonic yogicon ko oxikrut karne kii kshamta, or smog main upasthit rahane par shwasan tantra par gyaat vishakt prabhaav hote hai
 In medical experiments, the effect of gas produced from medical level oxygen is effected in a drug amount, but it is never done by breathing

 For this reason, the doctors are also afraid of forfeiting their permission letter on the use, prescribing, suggestion, etc
 of ozone therapy
 ozone therapy ke prayog se kai prakaar ke rogon main raahat milane ke kisse kahaniyaan hi sunne main aate hai, kintu inamen se maatr kuch hi pramanit ho paye hai
 In addition, ozone therapy may be helpful in mobilizing endogenous stem cells by inducing nitric oxide synthase, likely to promote ischemic tissue regeneration

 In this direction, it is possible that two major companies associated with the homeopathic medicine industry, Boeron India and Shawabe India, extract ozone medicine

 yah ek bahut bade kshetra par vistrut tha jo purv main hindu kush parvaton se pashchim main anatolia tak or uttar main madhya asia se dakshin main faras kii khadi tak failaa hua tha
 The Saljuq people originated from the Qinik subdivision of the Oguz branch of the Turkish-speaking people of the Steppi region of Central Asia
 inaki mul mathrubhumi aral sagar ke paas thi jahaan se inhonen pehle koraasaan , phir iran or phir anatolia par qabza kiya
 The Saljuq Empire led to the influence of Turkish culture in Iran, northern Afghanistan, the caucus, and other areas, and created a mixed iranian-turkish cultural tradition
 saljuq beg aral sagar or caspian sagar ke bich ke kshetra main sthit oguz yabatu rajya main unche afasar the or unhi ke naam par aage samrajya kaa naam 'saljuq' padaa
 They separated their clan and first camped along the head of the river, where this clan also adopted Islam
 iske baad unke pote tufril beg or chagari beg ne koraasaan main failana shuru kiya jahaan ve lutpaat karte the
 When the local Ghaznavi kingdom tried to stop them, on 23 May 1040, the Ghaznavis were defeated in the Battle of Dandanqan
 saljuq log koraasaan ke swami ho gaye or phir unhone aamu-paar kshetra or iran par bhi qabza kar liya
 By 1055, Tughril Beg had expanded his territory to Baghdad, where the Abbasid Caliph gave him the title of Sultan, which became the title of all the coming Saljuq rulers
 haalanki us samay iran main islam kii shiya shakha punap rahi thi, saljuq sunni the or aadhunik madhya purv main shiyaon kii tulana main adhik sunniyon ke hone kaa ek bada kaaran saljuqon kii nitiyaan thim
 The capital of the Saljuq empire was Nishapur and Isfahan
 inaki rajbhasha farsi thi jabaki buddhijiviyon dwaara adhiktar arabi bhashaa prayog kii jaati thi
 Its first ruler was Tughril I, and the last ruler was Tughril III

 nagpuri yaa sadri jharkhand va kuch anya rajyon main boli jane vaali ek hind-arya bhashaa he
 It is spoken by Sadani community, due to which it is also called Sadani language

 fadar peter shanti navrangi ne iske udbhav evam vikaas par prakaash daalate hue prashn uthaaya ki nagpuri chotanagpur kii arya bhinn boliyon ke madhya main kaise padi? kahan se ai? kab ai?3 nagpuri ke pratham vaiyaakaran rev
 i
 ech
 hvitaly ne nagpuri kaa sambandh kisi arya boli se nahin batalaaya
 On the other hand, the second capable grammar of Nagpuri Rev
 Konrad Bukout described Nagapuri as similar to Magahi, Bhojpuri, Chhattisgarhi etc
 phir bhi yah inase bhinn bhashaa he jo chotanagpur ke aranyon or pahadiyon ke bich based gaanvon main swatantratapurvak panpi or viksit hui
 Therefore, the pure form of Nagpuri is now safe in those villages
 5 fadar navrangi ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki yah kahana kathin he ki nagpuria sadaani bhashaa kis pracheen praakrit athwa madhyayug kii kisi apbhransh boli kaa vartmaan rup he
 Some forms of pronouns and verbs of this language resemble distant Rajasthani and Nepali forms, how many forms relate to ancient Vaiswari and Awadhi, how many forms correspond to the moving dialects of Bengali and Oriya
 6 Eminent scholar of Nagpuri language Prof
 Kesari Kumar has also said that like Magahi and Maithili, Nagapuri too is a definite dialect of Magadhi Apabhransh like him and belongs to Bihari
 7 dow suniti kumaar chaturjya ke anusaar magadhi prasut bhashaaon kii pracheen saamagree ke aadhaar par bhashavidon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki purvavarti magadhi apbhransh ke sabhi sthaneey roopon magahi, maithili, bhojpuri, bangala, oriya or asamiya ne aathvin shatabdi se gyarahavin shatabdi tak newnaadhik maatra main swatantra rup se apni aavashyaktaaon ko puraa kar liya hoga
 It is not possible to say definitely with respect to which century this earth was completed
 yahi sthiti ham nagpuri ke liye bhi kah sakate hai
