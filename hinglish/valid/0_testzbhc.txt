 According to the census of India, this village is located in Tehsil Chandausi, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh
 sambandhit janaganana code: rajya code :09 jila code :135 tehsil code : 00722 Khurd and Kalan are Persian language words found in many contexts in Hindi and in the Indian subcontinent, especially in place names
 "kurd" kaa matlab "chota" hota he or "kalaan" kaa matlab bada hota he
 These names have been used since Mughal times
 choti aabaadi vaale gaanvon-kasbon ke peeche khurd shabd lagaaya gaya
 This Persian word means small
 yah khurd sanskrit ke kshudra se hi bana he jisamen laghu, chota yaa sookshmata kaa bhav he
 There are thousands of Khurd dhari villages across the country
 isi tarah kai gaanvon ke saath kalam shabd judaa miltaa he jaise kosi kalam, baamaniyaan kalam 
 Just as the word khurd became synonymous with small or small, similarly the word kalan became synonymous with big or huge
 kalam kaa prayog lagbhag usee arth main hota tha jaise bharat ke liye prachinkaal main brihattar bharat shabd kaa prayog hota tha jisamen burma se lekar iran tak kaa samoochaa bhushetra aata tha
 However, a word like Hindustan Kalan is not found in any travelogue
 greater britain kii baat chalati thi to uske upniveshon kaa sandarbh nihit hota tha
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Kalan is also important in the context of rural populations
 kalam multah farsi kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab hota he varisht, bada, deergh yaa vishaal
 However, its etymology is unknown
 kuch sandarbhon main ise semetic bhashaa parivaar kaa bataaya jaataa he or ise ishwar kii mahanata se joda jaataa he
 This is fine on the basis of Kalan's economy, but it is not confirmed by any Semitic metal
 kalam shabd kaa prayog sirf sthanon kaa rutaba bataane ke liye hi nahin hota tha balki vyaktiyon ke naam bhi hote the jaise mirza kalam yaa amir kalam al bukhari jiskaa matlab bukhaara kaa mahaan amir hota he
 Obviously, the word Kalan means great here
 muslim shasankaal main basaahaton ke namakaran kii mahima yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The names of many villages are associated with the word elders such as Sonpipri elders
 jaahir he hamanaam gaanv se fark karne ke liye ek basaahat ko varisht maanate hue uske aage bujurg laga diya gaya or doosraa hua sonpipari khurd 
 Many such rural settlements number in the thousands
 isi tarah kisi gaanv ke vishisht darje ko dekhte hue uske saath jaagir shabd laga diya jaataa tha
 This means that from the annual revenue collection, the part of that village will not go into the government treasury or it will get partial exemption
 mughalon ke daur main prabhavi vyaktiyon ko athwa puraskaar swaroop saamaanya varg ke logo ko bhi gaanv jaagir main diye jate the
 But to distinguish it from other villages of the same name, the newly created vassals used to add jagirs to them like Hinautia and Hinautia Jagir
 uttar bharat, pakistan or afghanistan main kai aise gaanv, shahar or mohalle hai jo ek jagah shuru hue or phir falkar unke do hisse ho gaye - ek mukhya yaa bada hissaa or ek chota hissaa
 In this case, "kalan" came to be called behind the name of the big part and "khurd" behind the small part
 iske is kshetra main hazaron udahaaran hai - Sometimes two villages and hamlets are different, but by and large they meet and become one
 aise main is kshetra main rivaaj he ke yah baat spasht kii jaae ke kurd or kalaan donon kii baat ho rahi he or unhen "kurd kalam kaha jaataa he - These two words are also used in some other contexts - kendriya film pramann board yaa bhartiya sensor board bharat main filmon, tivi dharawahikon, tivi vigyapanon or vibhinn drishy saamagree kii samiksha karne sambandhi viniamak nikaay he
 It is under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India
 ise uparokt varnit sabhi ko vibhinn shrenee pradaan karne kaa or sweekaar yaa asweekaar karne kaa adhikaar he

 sambandhit janaganana code: rajya code :09 jila code :135 tehsil code : 00718 In astronomy, any planet is almost invisible in front of its parent star radiance when viewed from a distance
 udhaaharan ke liye hamaara surya hamaare saura mandal ke kisi bhi grah se ek arab guna se bhi adhik chamak rakhata he
 As it is, the brightness of the planets comes only from the reflection of the light of his ancestral body and disappears in the face of the bright glow of the Pitragraha
 yahi kaaran he ki bahut hi kam maanav-anaweshit bahirgrah sidhe unki chhavi dekhe jane se paae gaye hai
 Instead, almost all known extraterrestrials have been discovered by indirect methods, and astronomers are rapidly expanding such methods
 in vidhiyon ke prayog se kam-se-kam ek bahirgrah safaltaapurvak dhundha ja chukaa he
 This method goes by the three names of the radial velocity method, the Doppler method, and the dagmug method
 jab koi grah apane pitrutare kii parikrama karata he to vah bhi apane pitrutare par ek gurutvkarshak prabhaav daalata he, jis se vah tara bhi us tara-grah samooh ke sanhetikendra kii parikrama karata he
 Any star is moving at a velocity relative to our solar system, and this velocity can be measured by the movement of that star by the Doppler effect
 is veg main us taare kii parikrama se ek radial veg bhi jud jaataa he or ham ise us taare ke veg main dagamagaahat dwaara dekh sakate hai
 If more than one planet is present in the solar system of that star, then its total velocity shows the mixed radial velocity with the effect of all those planets, which we can separate by using mathematics
 in prabhaavon ko maapne ke liye hamaare yantron ko bahut hi samvedansheel hone kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, masalan hamaare surya main vishaal brihaspati keval 13 meter / saicond kaa radial veg utpann karata he or prithvi dwaara utpann radial veg keval 1 meter / saicond he
 Yet over time our instruments continued to develop and now many extraterrestrials are found by this method
 surya ke baad, hamaare sab se nikatatam taare proxima centori kii prarikrama kar rahaa proxima centori bi grah isi radial veg vidhi se san 2016 main anaweshit hua
 It is natural that the lower the mass of a parent, the larger its orbiting orbit and the smaller the radius of that planet's orbit, the greater the impact of that planet on its parent and the radial velocity in that star The effect of can be seen equally easily
 is karanvash radial veg vidhi se paae gaye bahirgrahon main badi sankhya main yaa to pitrutare bahut chote aakaar ke hai yaa phir vah bahirgrah bhimkaay hai, yaa tara-grah kii duuri bahut hi kam he

 a persistent environmental problem that Chiang Mai is facing is the problem of increasing air pollution which mainly starts in April and lasts for the next several weeks
 is mudde ko kuch samay se sweekaar kiya ja rahaa he
 In 1996, the fourth International Network of Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Conference, which was held that year in Chiang Mai, the then Governor of Chiang Mai, Virachai Navbunien, was the guest speaker, Dr
 Zakapan Vongburanawatt, who was at that time social at Mai Chiang University Was invited Dean of the Faculty of Science, so that he could consider the efforts being made for air pollution in Chiang Mai
 Door-to exchanged
 Dr
 Wongburanawatt said at the time in 1994 that, there was an increasing number of urban citizens in hospitals who come for respiratory problems due to air pollution
 thailand kaa prakritik sansaadhan or paryaavaran mantralay kaa pradooshan niyantran vibhaag jan jaagrukta abhiyaan or anya pahalon ke saath is samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye sakriy hai
 During this period, unlike the rest of the year, air quality in Chiang Mai is often below the standard because dust particles reach levels twice their standard
 mausam vibhaag ke uttari centre ne bataaya he ki china ke kam dabaav ke kshetra thai myanmar seemaa ke aas-paas jangalon kii dhuen se prabhavit hote hai
 Air quality in Chiang Mai has deteriorated markedly over the last ten years

 Often, mist prevails in the city during this period and it starts raining
 sookshm dhul ke kanon ke str kaa kabhi kabhi pareekshan kiya gaya he jo ki prati ghan meter 190 se 243 microgram ke bich nikle hai
 Minor sources of dust-borne pollution in Chiang Mai also include burning objects, including cremation, burning of trash, or smoke emanating from vehicles due to bad diesel
 in maamuli kaarnon main nirmaan or khudaai ke dauraan udati hui dhul bhi jud jaati he
 As the images from the satellite show, the main reason for air pollution is the customary practice in the mountainous areas in the hills, under which scrub forests are cleared by burning, especially on the Thai Myanmar border
 chiang maai kii samasya isliye bhi bad jaati he kyonki yah shahar, los angeles or salt lake shahar kii tarah hi, pahadiyon se ghira hua ek prakritik bhugolic katoraa he
 As a result, the movement of air slows down and it also picks up dust particles from cars and burning waste
 is vyutkram prabhaav kii vajah se, jab katore main hawa urti he, tab yah phir se palatati he or phir se shahar main hi baith jaati he
 This goes on till the winds do not change or the rain showers the wind
 The Thailand Pollution Control Department of Thailand's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has been actively trying to find a solution to this dangerous problem and has been successful in reducing the air quality index number of Chiang Mai for several years
 is samasya ko, chiyand maai or thailand main chalane vaale vibhinn rang ke saarvajanik parivahanjo savaariyon ko bahut saste kiraye par lete hai or jinhen songthev kehete hai, teevr kar dete hai

 Motorcycle riders can easily be seen moving behind these trucks, saving their respiratory tract
 yahi baat prasidd tuk-tuk ke vishay main bhi kahi ja sakati he jo thailand main sarvatra paae jate hai
 City officials are well aware of this issue and have started a campaign, under which all yellow and blue meter taxis will be replaced, replacing all old and defective vehicles
 As slowly, these old quality vehicles are being removed, it is still to be seen whether the exchange body will be able to make changes in Chiang Mai, facing the opposition of the drivers of these vehicles as these drivers have Traditionally, they have made a living in this way for the last several years
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki chiang maai hi keval aisa shahar nahin he jo is samasya se jujh rahaa he kyonki sampoorn thailand main tuk-tuk or songtheove hi kam laagat vaale parivahan ke mukhya saadhan hai
 Unfortunately, because the situation in Chiang Mai is like an inverted bowl, the carbon content emitted from the vehicles makes the problem more serious
 pichley kai saalon se, kyonki chiang maai kaa vaayu gunvattta suchakank anya kshetron ke mukaable adhik se adhik kharaab ho gaya he, isliye is samasya ko ab sthaneey str par pahachaanaa ja rahaa he

 The architecture of India is a mixture of traditional and external influences
 bhartiya vaastu kii visheshta yahan kii deevaaron ke utkrisht or prachur alankaran main he
 The scheme of frescoes and sculptures, which in addition to ornamentation, expresses a serious sense of its subject, sometimes completely envelops the building from the outside

 Two-three thousand years BC The discovery of the developed Indus Valley Civilization has brought to light a surprising fact that the oldest art of India was as aesthetic as any other civilization
 jab aajkal kii koi bhi sabhyataa jaagran kii angadaai bhi na le pai thi tab bharat kii yah kala itani viksit thi
 The town planning knowledge of the makers of these settlements was so mature, the materials used by them were of such excellent quality and the composition was so strong that the beginning of that civilization is bound to be considered long ago, about four five thousand years, BC

 Nevertheless, such a grotesque start to the history of end-to-end enriched Indian life with remarkable brilliance and excellent architectural expectation as well as more exploration, linking its link with the Aryan civilization, which is considered more ancient

 So, if any memorial work of that temporary creation is not seen today, then no wonder

 These tableau of Buddhist, Jain Vastu, Hindu Vastu, and Dravidian Vastu evolving together in the country are proof of the traditional religious tolerance of the vast India
 vaastukala par musalamaanon ke akraman kaa jitna prabhaav bharat main padaa utana anyatra kahin nahin, kyonki jis sabhyataa se muslim sabhyataa kii takkar hui, kisi se uskaa itnaa virodh nahin tha jitna bhartiya sabhyataa se
 Compared to the prestigious Indian social and religious trends, Muslim civilization was completely new, its fundamental principles were also different
 donon kaa sangharsh yatharthwaad kaa adarshavaad se, vaastaviktaa kaa swapndarshita se or vyakt kaa avyakt se sangharsh tha, jiskaa pramaan masjid or mandir ke bhed main spasht he

 Consequently, apart from religious buildings, such as mosques, tombs, rajas and dargahs, a variety of secular buildings, such as palaces, pavilions, nagarwadars, wells, gardens and large forts, were built up to the enclaves encircling the entire city
 desh main uttar se dakshin tak jaise jaise muslim prabhtv badhata ga, vaastukala kaa yug bhi badalata gaya
 Three successive stages of Muslim Vastu are evident
 pehla charan, jo bahut thode samay rahaa, vijaydarp or dharmandhta se prerit "nirmulan" kaa tha, jiske bare main hasan nizami likhata he ki prayek kila jeetne ke baad uske stambh or neenv tak mahakay haathiyon ke pairon tale rondwakar dhul main mila dene kaa rivaaj tha
 Many forts, cities and temples were made non-existent in this way

 The final phase began when Akranta was thoroughly awakened in many parts and he created well-crafted and exquisite architecture through planned construction rather than replacement
 shaileyon kii drushti se bhi muslim vaastu ke teen varg ho sakate hai
 The first is the Delhi style, or Shahanshahi style, often called "pathan Vastu"
 is varg main dilli kii qutubameenar, sultan gadhi, altamash kaa makbara, alaai daravaaza, nizamuddin, gayasuddin tughlaq or ferojshah tughlaq ke makbare, kotla ferojshah, mubarakashah kaa makbara, meerut kii masjid, shershah kii masjid sahasaram kaa shershah kaa makbara or ajmer kaa adhaai din kaa jhonpada aadi ullekhneey hai

 Scams can usually be of any of the following categories - bharat ke kuch pramukh hotale hai- According to modern psychologists, the sensations of sleeping consciousness are called dreams
 swapn ke anubhav kii tulana mrigatrushna ke anubhavon se kii gai he
 This is a kind of confusion
 swapn main sabhi vastuon ke abhaav main vibhinn prakaar kii vastuen dikhaai detii hai
 Some of the dreams can be likened to daydreams
 parantu divaswapn main vishesh prakaar ke anubhav karanevaala vyakti jaanata he ki vah amuk prakaar kaa anubhav kar rahaa he
 In the dream state, 99
9% of the experienced people do not know that they are dreaming, but in this world there are some intellectual people whose mind starts thinking more than the capacity which also identify themselves in the dream
 ek prayog ke dauraan kuch vaigyaniko ne bhi mana ki aisa sambhav lekin jab wo swapn main khud ko pahchaan legein to us swapn se baahar aana kaaphi masakkat bharaa hoga or isse kamjor dimag vaale vyakti ke coma main jane ke asaar kaaphi bad jate he aisi ghatana kisi vyakti ke saath hona kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin he
 The events of the dream relate to the present tense
 divaswapn kii ghatnaayen bhootkaal tathaa bhavishyakaal se sambandh rakhti hai
 According to the Indian view, dream is one of the four states of consciousness
 baaki teen avasthaaen jaagrathavastha, sushupti avasthaa or turiya avasthaa hai
 There are many similarities between dream and waking state
 atev jaagrathavastha ke aadhaar par swapn anubhavon ko samajhaayaa jaataa he
 Similarly, experiences of waking state are also explained on the basis of dream experiences
 swapn insaan kii yaadon, bhaawanaao, kalpanaao, soch, vichaaron, ichchhaaon or sabase bada uske dar kaa mila ek praaroop he
 The study of dreams is a new subject for psychology
 saadhaarant: swapn kaa anubhav aisa anubhav he jo hamaare saamaanya tark ke anusaar sarvatha nirarthak dikhaai detaa he
 Therefore, people who discuss the subject of psychological dreams are generally considered as useless people
 pracheen kaal main saadhaaran anpadh log swapn kii charchaa isliye kiya karte the ki ve samajhate the ki swapn ke dwaara is bhavi ghatnaon kaa andaaj laga sakate hai
 This belief remains in the general public even today
 aadhunik vaigyanik chintan is prakaar kii dharna ko niraadhaar maanata he or ise andhvishwaas samajhataa he
 Scientific studies of dreams have tried to find out what kinds of dreams can occur due to the influence of external stimuli
 soe hue kisi manushya ke pair par thandha pani daalane se use praaia: nadi main chalane kaa swapn hota he
 Similarly, due to cold at bedtime, one may dream of bathing or swimming in the river
 sharir par honevaale vibhinn prakaar ke prabhaav bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke swapnon ko utpann karte hai
 Dreams have also been studied from the medical point of view
 saadhaarant: rog kii badi chadhi avasthaa main rogi bhayanak swapn dekhtaa he or jab vah acha hone lagata he to vah swapnon main saumy drishy dekhtaa he
 Psychologists sometimes use hypnosis to study dreams
 vishesh prakaar ke sammohan dekar jab rogi ko sula diya jaataa he to use un sammohanon ke anusaar swapn dikhaai dete hai
 Some psychologists instruct the patient to remember dreams while sleeping
 tab rogi apane swapnon ko nahin bhuulataa
 The mental patient does not remember the dream initially
 aisi rogi ko sammohit karke uske swapn yaad karaae ja sakate hai
 Generally, we see the same things in dreams, whose values are formed on our mind
 ham praaia: dekhte hai ki hamaare swapnon kaa jaagrath avasthaa se koi sambandh nahin hota
 Sometimes we forget the parts of the dream which have special meaning for our life
 aise swapnon ko kushal manovaigyanik sammohan dwaara praapt kar lete hai
 It has been seen that the dreams which a man forgets, bring such things of his life to the consciousness which are extremely unpleasant to him and which are forgotten only for him
 aisi baton ko vishesh prakaar ke sammohan dwaara vyakti ko yaad karaayaa ja saktaa he
 These dreams have special importance in mental medicine
 bhartiya jyotish shaastra ke anusaar jis pahar or paksh main swapn dekha gaya hai uske anusaar hi swapn kaa fal nishchit kiya jaataa hai
 Dr
 Sigmund Freud has made the most important discoveries about dreams
 inhone apane adhyayan se yah nirdhaarit kiya ki manushya ke bhitari man ko jaanane ke liye uske swapnon ko jaananaa nitant aavashyak he
 In his treatise entitled "interpretation of Dreams and Dreams", he tried to explain that dreams which we think as meaningless have special meaning
 inhone swapnon ke sanketon ke arth bataane or unki rachana ko spasht karne kii cheshtaa kii he
 According to his statement, the dream expresses our desires in general or symbolically, which does not satisfy its waking state
 pita kii daant ke dar se jab balak mithai or khilone kharidne kii apni ichha ko prakat nahin karata to uski damit ichha swapn ke dwaara apni tripti paa leti he
 As the age of man increases, his fear of society gets complicated
 is bhay ke kaaran vah apni anuchit ichchhaaon ko na keval dusron se chhipaane kii cheshtaa karata he varan vah swayan se bhi chhipaata he
 According to Dr
 Freud, the human mind has three parts
 pehla bhaag vah he jisamen sabhi icchaayen aakar apni tripti paati hai
 To satisfy them, a man has to work with his willpower
 man kaa yah bhaag chetan man kehalaata he
 This part coordinates the person with the outer world
 manushya ke man kaa doosraa bhaag achetan man kehalaata he
 This part is the shelter of all his pleasures
 isi main uski sabhi damit icchaayen rahati hai
 The third part of his mind is called subconscious mind
 is bhaag main manushya kaa naitik swatv rahata he
 Dr
 Freud has equated moral self with the state's censor department
 jis prakaar rajya kaa censor vibhaag kisi nae samachar ke prakashit hone ke purv uski chaanbin kar letaa he
 In the same way, the sensor present in the subconscious mind of man, ie the moral self, trumps any lust before it is published in the dream
 atyant apriy athwa aniatik swapn dekhne ke pashchaat manushya ko aatmabhatrsana hoti he
 In order to save the dreamer from this self-abnegation, the sensor's department of his mind illuminates the suppressed desire by manipulating many kinds of dreams
 phir jaagrath hone par yahi censor hamen swapn ke us bhaag ko bhulawa detaa he
 Which causes self-immolation
 isi kaaran ham puure swapnon ko hi bhul jate hai
 Dr
 Freud has given special types of meanings to dream symbols
 inamen se adhik pratik jananendriya sambandhi hai
 According to his statement, many fruitless actions occurring in dreams are indicative of movement
 unka kathan he ki manushya kii pradhan vaasana, kamvasana he
 This gives him maximum physical pleasure and this is also the most oppressed in his life
 swapn main adhiktar hamaari damit icchaayen hi chhipakar vibhinn pratikon dwaara prakashit hoti hai
 The most pitying desire is libido
 isliye hamaare adhik swapn usee se sambandh rakhte hai
 In the case of mental patients it is seen that on the one hand his strong libido remains in repressed state and on the other hand it is difficult for him to accept his presence
 isliye hi maansik rogiyon ke swapn na keval jatil hote hai varan ve bhul bhi jate hai
 Dr
 Freud has given five-seven types of dreaming
 unamem se pradhan hai - sankshepan, vistarikaran, bhavantarakaran tathaa naatakeekaran
 According to the abbreviation, a very large context is truncated
 vistarikaran main thik iskaa ulta hota he
 In this, dreaming expresses a little experience in a long dream
 maan lijie kisi vyakti ne kisi party main hamaara apmaan kar diya or iskaa ham badla lenaa chaahate hai
 But our moral dream is against it, then we will see in our dream that the person who has insulted us is lying in many kinds of accidents
 ham uski sahaayta karnaa chaahate hai, parantu paristhitiyon aisi hai jinke kaaran ham uski sahaayta nahin kar pate
 In the state of emotionalization, we do not see our immoral sentiments being published towards such a person, towards whom the revelation of those sentiments creates self-aggression
 kabhi-kabhi kishor balak bhayanak swapn dekhte hai
 In them they find themselves fighting with a demon
 manovishleshan se peeche pataa chalata he ki yah rakshas unka pita, chachaa, bada bhai, adhyaaapak athwa koi anushaasak hi rahata he
 According to the dramatization, when an idea is illuminated in a desire or dream, it mostly takes the support of the vision images
 swapnchetana anek maarmik baton ko ek puri paristhiti chitrit karke dikhaati he
 The dream does not give any education directly 
 swapn main jo anek chitron or ghatnaon ke sahare koi bhav vyakt hota he uskaa arth turant lagaana sambhav nahin hota
 Suppose we are alone and we fear that no one can attack us
 yah chota sa bhav anek swapnon ko utpann karata he
 We fall into a situation where we feel safe but we feel betrayed later
 doctor frid kaa kathan he ki swapn ke do rup hote hai - ek prakashit or doosraa aprakashit
 The dream we remember is the illuminated form
 yah rup uparyukt anek prakaar kii tod mode kii rachanaaon or pratikon ke saath hamaari chetana ke samaksh aata he
 The actual form of the dream is that which is achieved through esoteric psychological discovery
 swapn kaa jo arth saamaanya log lagaate hai vah uske vaastavik arth se bahut dur hota he
 This real meaning cannot be applied without dreaming art
 doctor frid ne swapnanubhav ke bare main nimnlikhit baat mahatv kii bataai hai : swapn maansik pratigaman kaa parinaam he
 This regression lasts for a short period
 atev isse vyakti ke maansik vikaas kii kii kshati nahin hoti
 Secondly this regression occurs in the form of acting
 is kaaran isse manushya kii un ichchhaaon kaa rechan ho jaataa he jo bachapan kii avasthaa kii hoti hai
 If a person does not have such dreams, then his mental development stops or he gets some kind of mental disease
 doctor frid ne duusari mahatv kii baat yah bataai he ki swapn nidra kaa vinaashak nahin varan uskaa rakshak he
 The repressed excitement comes out of terrible or aggravating dreams
 swapn maanav shravan kii jatil samasyaon ko hal karne kaa ek maarg he
 Freud stated the third point that the dream is neither a vain mental experience nor the visuals seen in it are meaningless
 apriy swapnon dwaara vyakti ke maansik swasthya kii raksha hoti he
 Studying dreams is absolutely necessary to understand the inner form of the mind
 swapnon ko doctor frid ne manushya ke aantarik man kii kunjee kaha he
 Many suppressed feelings of the patient come to the surface of consciousness due to dream-related interactions and thus their catharsis
 kisi rogi ke anek swapn sunate or unka arth lagaate lagaate rogi kaa rog nasht ho jaataa he
 In the initial stage of mental therapy, the patient often does not remember dreams
 jaise-jaise rogi or chikitsak kii bhavatmak ekta sthapit hoti he vaise-vaise use swapn adhikadhik hone lagate hai tathaa ve adhikadhik spasht bhi hote hai
 The same dream occurs in many ways
 swapn kaa bhav anek prakaar ke swapnon dwaara chikitsak ke samaksh aata he
 Charles Yung has said some things different from Dr
 Freud about the dream
 unke kathananusaar swapn ke pratik sabhi samay ek hi arth nahin rakhte
 To know the true meaning of dreams, it is absolutely necessary to know the dreamer's personality, to understand its special problems and to keep in mind the country, time and circumstances at that time
 ek hi swapn bhinn-bhinn swapndrashtaa ke liye bhinn-bhinn arth rakhata he or ek hi drashtaa ke liye bhinn-bhinn paristhitiyon main bhi uske bhinn-bhinn arth hote hai
 Therefore, until the dreamer himself accepts any meaning, we should not know that the true meaning of the dream will be obtained
 doctor frid kii manyata ke anusaar adhik swapn hamaari kaam vaasana se hi sambandh rakhte hai
 According to Yung, dreams are not only a suppression of a person's personal experience or his selfish desires, but also the spiritual experiences of his most serious mind
 isi ke kaaran manushya apane swapnon ke dwaara jeevanopayogi shiksha bhi praapt kar letaa he
 According to Charles Yung, dreams are not merely a reaction to old experiences, but they are related to the future life of man
 doctor frid saamaanya prakritik jadwaadi karankarya pranali ke anusaar manushya ke man kii sabhi pratikriyaaon ko samajhane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 In contrast to these, doctor Yung proves to be primarily targeted at mental reactions
 jo vaigyanik pranali jad padaarthon ke vyavhaaron ko samajhane ke liye upyukt hoti he vahi pranali chetan kriyaaon ko samajhane main nahin lagaai ja sakati
 All the functions of consciousness are objective
 swapn bhi isi prakaar kaa ek lakshyapurna kaary he jiskaa uddeshy rogi ke bhavi jivan ko neerog athwa safal bananaa he
 According to Yung's statement, a man can know such things by dream, according to which he can save himself from many kinds of accidents and sorrows
 is tathy ko unhone anek drushtaanton ke dwaara samajhaayaa he
 Science of dreams - We dream all night
 divaa swapn bhi aksar log dekhte rahete hai, divaa swapn kalpana kehalaate hai
 The dream seen in the sleep is the dream
 kabhi kabhi kuch kam avadhi ke swapn yaad rahete hai
 In Shruti, the subject of dreams has been discussed from place to place
 vrihadaaranyak upanishad main swapn ke vishay main prasang he, jis prakaar ek raja apane sevak or praja ke saath desh kaa bhraman karata he usee prakaar jeev swapnavastha main praan, shabd, vaani aadi ko lekar is sharir main icchaanusaar vichrata he
 There is a description in the Vrhadaranyaka Upanishad, that in one's own life, the living being sees both the world and the world, and the sorrow experiences both happiness and happiness
 is sthool sharir ko achet karke jeev vaasanamay sharir kii rachana karata he phir lok paralok dekhtaa he
 At this stage, country and abroad, river, pond, ocean, mountain plain
 Trees, feces, urine, women, men, sex, anger, fear etc
 create many different types of worlds
 jeev dwaara swapn main bhi sristi-sansaarik padaarthon kii rachana hoti he
 This composition is very mysterious and very bizarre
 manducopanishad main gudh rup se swapn ko spasht kiya he

 Muladhara, Swadhisthan, Manipur, Anahata, Pure, Command, Sahatradhar Chakra
 Nineteen mouths, five senses, five senses
 Five souls - Prana, apan, saman, 'wynn, udan and mind, intellect, mind, ego
 ukaar maatra duusari or shreshth akar ubhay bhav he swapnavat taijas doosar paad In a dream, the soul is one with all its titles, at this time, because the inner being is bright, the soul is called Taizas in this state

 In the dream state, both the spirit and the spirit of the soul experience the word touch form juice smell mentally
 taijas sookshm vishyon kaa bhokta he
 Both nature and spirit are impenetrable like the reflection of the sky in the water drop and in the reservoir
 The Yatha Sopanishad says - 'yesh supteshu jagarti kamam kamam purusho nirmanamah': This man who creates many pleasures when everyone is asleep Wakes up on his own
 yahan purush ko kaamanaayon kaa nirmaataa batalaaya he
 Therefore, there is a creation in the dream, is the creation in the dream real? -taatkaalik rup se swapn main hui sristi kaa koi astitv nahin dikhaayi detaa parantu is vishay main meraa nishchit vichaar he ki swapn main jo bhi dekha suna jaataa he use sristi main kisi na kisi jagah kisi na kisi jeev athwa padaarth ke rup main hona nishchit he
 There is a deep connection between the dream and the development of the world, if there is a dream, then there is a world and if there is a creation, there are dreams
 swapn ke shubh–ashubh parinaam-shruti kaa is vishay main nishchat mat he ki swapn bhavishya main hone vaale shubh–ashubh parinaam ke suchak hai
 According to Aitareya Aranyak, seeing a man with teeth in a dream is a sign of death

c susupti kaa rahasy- sushupti kaale sakale vili tamobhibhutah sukhrupameti – kevalya Sleep is necessary for every living being
 There are two stages of sleep
 swapnavastha or sushupti
 sushupti vah avasthaa he jab koi swapn bhi nahin rahata
 prashnopenishad bataata he jab udaan vaayu dwaara CNS purna rup se adhikaar kar liya jaataa he tab sushupti avasthaa hoti he
 Vedanta tells that the senses and their subjects do not remain in the sleep period
 There is no attachment in this state, the organism experiences joy here
 sushupti kaal main sthool or sookshm donon villin ho jate hai
 Practical powers and dream traps are absorbed in ignorance for their own reasons
 keval shuddh chetanya ansh upasthit rahata he
 In this state, God and living beings experience joy, but at this time the instinct is ignorant Mandukyopanishad explains the sleep
 nahin swapn nahin drishysupt sam he gyaan ghan mukh chaitanya parabrahm anand bhoga kaa bhokta tisar paad par brahm
 The third volume measure is merged, the merit of the place of mercy is in the body chaitanya se deept agyaan vritti se mukt hokar anand ko bhogata he
 That is why a man who is asleep and says, i slept soundly, slept soundly, these words reveal the existence of joy in sleep
 mujhe kuch yaad nahin he, isse agyaan ke astitv kaa bhi pataa chalata he
