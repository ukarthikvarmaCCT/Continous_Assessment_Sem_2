 The Muslim government in the subcontinent was over and the Muslims of 1857 had lost their independence due to the extreme revenge of the British
 Since the British had taken the government away from the Muslims and in the Gadar, the Muslims were the only ones, so the British persecuted the Muslims
 Millions of Muslims have also been hanged to death by sympathy and they have been executed and their policies have been subscribed
 It was decided that the business of the Muslims began to be destroyed, that the Muslims who used to live a magnificent ishrat life in the big eleven palaces, the same Muslims were forced to live a life in broken small houses, in the British country, by turning on English education, the Muslims gave their children
 Did not want to teach English education because he did not want non Muslim Muslims to train their children other Are that the British had Mkarana thinking the end of the schools bring Broye car Arabic and Persian Turned on English as well as refused to offer the Friday prayers, so the Muslims boycotted English education which did not give them any government job
 In short, Indian Muslim education, social, political and economic collapse On the other hand, the British were all on seal seal and with it there was a thin opposition and Hindu interests on the formation of the party
 For the British ears Dan Hume formed the All India National Congress which, on seeing it, claimed to be a party of both Hindu and Muslim but in reality it was only the representative party of Hinduism which considered themselves as the British and after the British the Indian Man Hindu Hindus wanted to make Hind their slaves by making the rule, then the Muslims moved to Dhaka in 1906 to protect their rights

 The collapse was developing politically and economically
 On the other hand, the British were all on seal and with it, for the formation of a thin opposition and a party of Hindu interests, the British ear Dan Hume formed the All India National Congress, which was seen as a party of both Hindu Muslims
 Claimed to be but in fact was only the representative party of Hinduism which considered itself as the British and after the British Artiy man was Hti want to make Hindu Raj configuration of Muslmanane Indian slaves and Muslims established the All India Muslim League in Dhaka in 1906 to protect their rights

 First, the top layer of the earth became solid due to frost, but the process of cooling down continued, so the bottom surface shrinked and separated from the top layer

 According to Arthur Holmes's hypothesis of convection currents, the currents of heat in earth's womb run downward

 Therefore, instead of turning convection currents coming from two different directions, mountain-building forces are born

 Thus the nearly 1,000-mile-long section of the site shrunk, causing twists and cracks in the Tithys landform and the formation of the Alps Mountains in Europe

 main prastut kar diya tha or konigsburg vishvavidhyalay ne use ukt oopaadhi pradaan kar uski yogyata pramanit kii thi
 But there was no change in his personal problems
 vishvavidhyalay ne uske nau varsh ke parishram se prasann hokar use vishisht vyaakhyaata niyukt kar liya tha, kintu is kaary ke liye use vetan kuch bhi nahin miltaa tha
 Kant, despite odd circumstances, served the university unpaid until 1766 AD
 1758 i
 main usne tark or darshan ke mukhya adhyaaapak pad ke liye prarthana kii thi, kintu vah asafal rahaa
 In 1766 AD, he was appointed Assistant Library Manager along with teaching and now he got ten pounds annual salary
 chaar varshon tak kaant ne is rup main bhi kaary kiya, kintu usne adhyayan chintan or lekhan kaary jari rakhaa
 After being appointed "private Dozant", by 1770 AD, five of his epics were published - uparyukt granthon ke sheershakon se pataa chalata he ki 1755 or 1770 i
 ke bich kaa samay kaant ke vichaaron ke nirmaan kaa tha
 His thinking appears to have developed in a systematic way with the Latin installation paper published in 1770 AD - "the Shapes and Principles of World's Understanding and Wisdom"
 isi varsh, vah konigsburg vishvavidhyalay main tark or darshan ke usee adhyaaapak pad par niyukt hua, jiske liai use 12 varsh purv niraash hona padaa tha
 He had already become worry-free as he was getting 60 pounds annual salary
 un dinon itnaa vetan sammanit adhyapakon ko hi diya jaataa tha
 The publication of texts also did not yield any large amount of money

 Other texts of this period include "the Role of Every Future Philosophy", "the Background of Ethics", "the Philosophical Foundations of Natural Science", "review of Practical Wisdom", "review of Judgment", "religion Limited Only by Wisdom", and " On eternal peace "
 1796 i
 ke baad bhi vah adhyayan, chintan evam lekhan main vyast rahaa kintu uske jivan ke ye aath varsh badi dayaneey dasha main vyateet hue
 His memory had become so weak that he had to remember even by writing small things
 swayan apane ghar kii dekhbhaal karne kii shakti usamen nahin thi; vivaah usne kiya nahin tha, kintu 42 varsh ke adhyaapan kaal main usne apane sahyogiyon evam vidhyaarthiyon par acha prabhaav daalaa tha
 Therefore, he received a lot of support and sympathy from friends and disciples in the last part of his life
 san 1801 i
 ke baad to vah bahut hi ashakt ho gaya tha, kintu antim teen varshon main vesiyaanski naamak uske shishy ne saath rahakar ahernish uski dekhbhaal kii
 Surprisingly, there are seven texts of Kant written in this period - "nitidarshan", "philosophical Foundations of the Theory of Moral Merit", "maanas shaktiyon kaa antvirodh,, "anthropology in practical terms", "tarkshastra, "bhautik bhugol" tathaa "shikshashastra" 
 After doing so much work, he died on 12 February 1804 in Königsberg
 kaant kaa vyaktigat jivan atal niyamon se jakadaaa hua tha
 From dawn to dusk, all his works were done at certain times

 Most of the Western philosophers have been wandering, but Kant went more than sixty miles from his city in his lifetime
 phir bhi uskaa drushtikon sankuchit na tha
 He was not merely an intellectual thinker, he gave his philosophical ideas a place in life like Socrates and Pythagoras
 hine naamak german kavi ne kaant ke darshanik jivan kii prashansa main aisi baaten kahi hai jo use sanakee siddh karti hai, kintu, uske vichaaron ne uttarvarti darshan ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki kaant ke adhyeta use darshan main ek naveen yug kaa pravartak maanate hai

 george barkali ek angrej-yri darshanik the jinhone 'immaterialism' kaa siddhanth diya jise baad main aatmanishth adarshavaad kaha gaya
 Berklee was born on 12 March 1685 in Dysert, Philkenny
 11 varsh kii umr main inhone philkaini skool main pravesh kiya or chaar varsh uparaant ye trinity kalege chale gaye
 There were undergraduates, graduates, fellows and tutors
 san 1713 main landan chale gaye
 There he was introduced to Swift, Steele, Edison and Pope
 unhone aath varsh england or europe kaa bhraman karne main vyateet kiye
 On his return from the excursion he first rose to the position of Dromore and then Dean of Derry
 seva or paroapkaar kii bhaavana se prerit hokar unhone tyaagptr de diya or america chale gaye
 But after not getting the money sanctioned from the Government of England, he returned to his country disappointed
 1734 main unhone clon kaa bishap bananaa sweekaar kar liya or usee saadhaaran pad par rahakar darshanik chintan karte rahe
 From time to time he wrote articles and books and got them published
 vriddhavastha main barkali vishram hetu oxford chale gaye or kuch maheenon baad vahiin unki mrityu ho gai
 Berklee did his main compositions in the early period of his life
 'ain ese tuvards e new theory ov vijan', 'treates cancerning di principles ov human nolej', 'thri dialogs bitwin helis and philonus', 'di motu' 'alcefreen' athwa 'mynut philasafar' or syrim : 'e chen ov philasophical riflactions' naamak granth likhe
 Berklee, considering gnanamimamsa, came to the conclusion that abstract suffixes do not exist
 anubhav main aanevaali vastuon ke saamaanya gunon kaa sanket karanevaale shabd keval naam hai
 They have no real authority
 hamaare anubhav main jo gyaan aata he vah vishesh kaa hi hota he
 Words are just symbols for suffixes
 shabd ko hi pratyay maan lenaa baari mul he
 Berkley's view has abstract suffixes or general names only
 barkali ne apane purvagami darshanik jon lock ke anubhavvaad ko adhik prakarsh pradaan kiya
 Locke assumed the power of a basis in which the properties of material objects reside
 uskaa pratyaksh anubhav nahin hota, phir bhi uskaa astitv avashya he
 Berklee did not accept it
 lock kaa vishwaas tha ki mul yaa mukhya gunon kii satta drashtaa se swatantra or bhinn he, isliye un gunon kaa avlamb drav bhi baahar hona chahie
 Berklee refuted the distinction of primary and secondary qualities by tact and tried to prove all qualities to be mindless
 at: unhone padaarth yaa vastu kaa bhi swatantra astitv sweekaar nahin kiya
 Berkeley's famous statement that 'existence means being the subject of realization
 ' koi vastu he, iskaa yahi aashay he ki koi vyakti use dekhtaa, sunata yaa anya rup se uskaa anubhav karata he
 There is no proof of the power of something which is not experienced
 yadi anubhav kaa pareekshan kiya jaae to gyaat hoga ki hamaare pratyay hi anubhav ke vishay hai
 Therefore, the existence of suffix and suffix two can only be accepted
 lock ke vipareet barkali pratyay ko vastu jagat kii pratilipi nahin maanate hai
 In addition to passive suffixes, Berklee also accepts the existence of a functional substance, namely the soul
 aatma ke dwaara anubhav grahan kiye jate hai or vednaaon kii pratiti hoti he
 The soul has a special insight
 yadhyapi sansar kii vastuon kii bhanti ishwar ke astitv kaa anubhav nahin hota he tathaapi bishap hone ke naate barkali ishwar kii satta maanate hai
 God is the reason for suffixes arising from a particular sequence in our mind
 ishwar aatmrup he
 He generates a suffix in our soul
 ishwar kii satta ko maanakar barkali ne apni darshanik paddati ko sarvahanvaad ke gadde main girane se bachaa liya he

 Due to the uncertain nature of these symptoms, they are often not recognized as signs of HIV infection
 Regardless of whether patients go to their doctor or to a hospital, they will often be misdiagnosed assuming they suffer from the more common infectious diseases in which these symptoms are seen

 HIV can infect many types of resistant cells, such as CD4 + t cells, macrophages, and microglial cells
 The virion envelope on the target cell for entry of HIV-1 into macrophages and CD4 + t is mediated by the interactions of glycoproteins with CD4 molecules and with chemokine receptors

 However, the use of only receptors does not explain bacterial follow-up because not all R5 bacteria are able to use CCR5 on a macrophage for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which Probably forms a repository which, when the number of CDR4 + t cells reaches very low levels Maintains Nkramn
 kuch log echivi ke vishisht khinchaavon ke prati pratirodhi hote hai
 For example, those with CCR5-Δ32 mutations are resistant to infection with the R5 bacterium because this mutation prevents HIV from binding to this receptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells

 swadhinata ke baad se hamaare desh main, hindi ke bare main kutarkon ke aise jaal lagaataar failaae jate rahe hai
 The result of them is that Hindi has not been able to find its mandatory historical place till date

 This statement of the CBI later proved to be a lie, as documents were received in English by the Indian Embassy

 haalanki congress sarkaar ne is iske liye purvavarti endie sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 The Bofors scandal is two decades old

 Since Quattrocchi has been close to the gandhi-nehru family, this was painful for Sonia Gandhi
 vidhimantri hansraj bharadwaj ke pad se samjhauta kiya gaya or isse pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh kii eemaandaaree par bhi sawaal uthe
 Together, the Congress party had to pay a heavy price in this matter
 ek dashak pehle da hindu kii samvaadadaata chitra subrahmanyam ne sawaal uthaaya ki agar gandhi parivaar doshi nahin he to ve apane dost kwatrochi kii jaanch main madad kyon nahin karte
 If Rajiv Gandhi is not involved in this, then it should be ascertained that if the CBI investigation is stalling
 aise hi sawaal aaj bhi puche ja rahe hai ki congress kii sarkaar centre main aate hi kyon vidhi mantralay ne kwatrochi ke khaaton par lagi roak ko hataane kaa aadesh diya
 In April 2009, Interpol removed the redcorner notice issued against Quattrocchi at the request of the CBI

 The five sites have more than 100 alleles that have been found in human populations, the most variable of which are HLA b and HLA DRB1
 The alleles decided by 2004 are scheduled in the table below
 is talika ko samajhane ke liye yah maananaa jaruri he ki yugmavikalpi kisi sthal par newcliotide ) kram kaa ek bhinn rup hota he, is tarah ki prayek yugmavikalpi anya sabhi yugmaviklpiyon se kam se kam ek sthiti ) main bhinn hota he
 These changes lead to a change in most amino acid sequences that can result in mild to large functional differences in proteins
 kuch bate hai jo is parivartan ko simit karti hai
 Some alleles such as DQA1 * 0501 and DQA1 * 0505 encode proteins with uniformly prepared products
 anya yugmavikalpi jaise dicubi1*0201 or dicubi1*0202 aise proteinon kaa utpaadan karte hai jo kaaryaatmak rup se samaan hote hai
 For class II, DP and DQ), the amino acid variants within the customer's peptide binding cleft produce molecules with different binding capacities

 There are several types of serotypes
 ek bada pratijan serovarg koshikaon kii pahchaan kaa ek aprishkrut tarika he
 For example, HLA can identify cells from individuals with the A9 serotypes A23 and A24, as well as cells that cannot be identified due to small differences in A23 and A24
 A23 and A24 are divided antigens, but their specific antibodies are used more often than antibodies to larger antigens
 ek pratinidhi koshikeey vishleshan mishrit lasikakoshika samvardh hota he or echele varg II prakaaron ko nirdhaarit karne ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Cellular analysis is more sensitive to detecting variations of HLA than serotyping
 aisa isaliye hota he kyonki aloentisira dwaara na pahachaani gai choti-moti bhinnataayen tii koshikaon ko protsaahit kar sakati hai
 This classification is named the DW class

 Large antigen types are still useful, such as for classifying very diverse populations with many unknown HLA alleles
 Africa, South Iran and Arabia show that it is difficult to classify the areas that were occupied earlier

 Finally, a sequence-based function determines which new alleles will go in which seros group according to order or reactivity
 Once the sequence is verified, a number is assigned to it
 udhaaharan ke liye, bi44 ke naye yugmavikalpi ko serovarg bi*4465 kaha jayega kyonki 65waan bi44 yugmavikalpi he
