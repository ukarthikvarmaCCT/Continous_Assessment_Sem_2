 The objects that appear in the sky sometimes moving from one side to another or falling on the earth are called 'breaking stars' or 'luka' in meteor and common colloquium
 ulkaon kaa jo ansh vayumandal main jalane se bachakar prithvi tak pahunchataa he use ulkapind kehete hai
 Meteors can be seen in countless numbers each night, but the number of bodies that fall on the earth is very small
 vaigyanik drushti se inkaa mahatv bahut adhik he kyonki ek to ye ati durlabh hote hai, duusare akaash main vichrate hue vibhinn grahon ityadi ke sanghathan or sanrachana ke gyaan ke pratyaksh strot keval ye hi pind hai
 By studying them, we also get a sense of what are the reactions on the matter coming from the sky in the global environment
 is prakaar ye pind brahmandavidya or bhuvigyaan ke bich sampark sthapit karte hai
 Although man was familiar with these falling stars from very ancient times, in the development of modern science, it took a long time for man to believe that these bodies found on the ground came from the sky on earth
 18veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main di
 trauyali naamak darshanik ne italy main albareto sthaan par gire hue ulkapind kaa varnan karte hue yah vichaar prakat kiya ki vah khamandal se tuutate hue taare ke rup main aayaa hoga, kintu kisi ne bhi isapar dhyaan nahin diya
 In 1768, Father Basile automatically saw a meteorite coming to Earth at a place called Luce in France
 agle varsh usne paris kii vigyaan kii royal academi ke adhiveshan main is vrittant par ek lekh padhaa
 Not believing the account, the Academy appointed a commission to investigate the incident, reporting that Father Basile's account was misleading, stating that the body of the body had become somewhat glassy due to lightning
 This led to the confusion of Basile that these bodies are not part of the earth
 tadnantar german darshanik cladni ne san 1794 i
 main siberia se praapt ek ulkapind kaa adhyayan karte hue yah siddhant prastaavit kiya ki ye pind khamandal ke pratinidhi hote hai
 Although this idea was not immediately accepted even this time, Claudney received the credit for drawing attention to this topic and since then scientists began to give more attention to the subject
 san 1803 i
 main france main laa agil sthaan par ulkapindon kii ek bahut badi vrishti hui jisamen anginat chote-bade pathar gire or unamem se praaia: do-teen hajaar ikatthe bhi kiye ja sake
 The French Academy of Sciences thoroughly researched the rain, and in the end no one suspected that meteorites actually came to Earth from the mantle
 ulkapindon kaa mukhya vargeekaran unke sanghathan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Some bodies are mostly made of iron, nickel or alloys and some resemble stones made of silicate minerals
 pehle vargvaalon ko dhatvik or duusare vargvaalon ko aashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In addition, metallic and surprising substances are often found in the same quantity in some bodies, they are called metallic meteorites
 vastut: purnataya dhatvik or purnataya aashmik ulkpindon ke bich sabhi prakaar kii ant:sth jatiyon ke ulkapind paae jate hai jisase pindon ke varg kaa nirnay karnaa bahudhaa kathin ho jaataa he
 Depending on the structure, strains are made in all three classes
 aashmik pindon main do mukhya upbhed hai jinamein se ek ko kaundrite or duusare ko akundrite kehete hai
 The main feature of the first subclass is that some specific circular grains, called caudreule, are present in them
 jin pindon main kaundrul upasthit nahin rahete unhen akundrite kehete hai
 There are also two main strains in metallic meteorites which are called Ashtaniq and Shasthanik respectively
 ye naam pindon kii antarrachana vyakt karte hai or jaisaa in naamon se vyakt hota he, pehle vibhed ke pindon main dhatvik padaarth ke bandha ashtani aakaar main or duusare main shashthinik aakaar main vinyast hote hai
 This type of composition is called Vidmanstetter and it can be identified with great ease on the leaf page of the body
 dhatvashmik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upvarg hai jinhen krmanusaar pelesite or ardhdhathwik kehete hai
 The surprising part of the first subclass of these bodies is mainly made up of olivine minerals, which are often circular and are incorporated into a system of ferrous-nickel metals
 ardhdhathwik ulkapindon main mukhyat: piroxin or alp maatra main anaurthite felsapaar vidyaman hote hai
 It has been mentioned in the earlier case that meteorites are classified based on the primacy of metallic and astral organs
 kintu in pindon main rasinic tatwon or khanijon ke vitaran ke sambandh main koi sunishchit aadhaar prathit nahin hota
 Apart from the three main classes of meteorites, there are several subclasses, each with its own distinct mineral community
 abhi tak praaia: 25 nae virgon kaa pataa laga he or praaia: prati do varsh ek nae upvarg kaa pataa lagata rahaa he
 The difficulty is that the materials available for study are very small
 abhi tak ulkapindon main keval 52 rasinic tatwon kii upasthiti pramanit hui he jinke naam nimnlikhit hai:

 helium Of these 52 elements, only eight are found in abundance, of which Hall is the most prominent
 anya saat main krmanusaar oxijan, silicon, manganisheium, gandhak, aluminium, nikal or calcium hai
 In addition to these, 20 other elements are found in sufficient quantity and their presence was detected before 1926 by simple chemical analysis
 shesh 24 tatv atyant alp maatra main vidyaman hai evam unki upasthiti varnakramadarshaki vishleshan se siddh kii gai he
 From the point of view of mineral composition there are many differences in the characteristics of meteorites and rocks found in the earth
 saadharantaya bhumandaleey shail raashiyon main swatantra dhaatu rup main loha tathaa nikal atyant durlabh hote hai, kintu ulkapindon main dhaatuen shuddh rup main bahut prachurtaa se tathaa praaia: anivaaryat: pai jaati hai
 In addition, there are many minerals that are not found in terrestrial rocks, but are found in meteorites
 inamen se pramukh oldemite or shribersite hai
 Both these minerals are not permanent in abundance of moisture and oxygen and hence are not found in global rocks
 inaki upasthiti se yah bodh hota he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti aise vaataavaran main hui jahaan bhumandal kii apeksha oxidikaran kii paristhitiyaan nune rahi hongi
 Astounding meteorites generally lack the abundance of pyroxene and olivine and lack of feldspar, making their organization similar to the superfamous rocks of the planet
 ulkapindon kii utpatti kaa vishay bahut hi vivaadaaspad he
 Several views have been proposed on this subject from time to time, in some of which they have been considered as part of Earth, Moon, Sun and Comet etc
 ek ati maanya mat ke anusaar inaki utpatti ek aise grah se hui jo ab purnataya vinasht ho gaya he
 In this view, it is imagined that in the beginning, there must have been a planet in the shape of Mars which was destroyed when it came very close to another big planet, or collided with another planet, due to which billions of small number Large blocks formed which are visible in meteorite form
 is mat ke anusaar dhatvik ulka us kalpit grah kaa kendriya bhaag tathaa aashmik ulka upree prishth nirupit karte hai
 Although this metaphor explains many symptoms of meteorites, many things remain an incomprehensible puzzle
 udaahranarth kuch dhatvik ulkapindon main ashtani rachana hoti he jo saadharantaya 800 degree centegrade taap par nasht ho jaati he
 It is believed that during the fission of that fictitious planet, there must have been more heat in it
 phir bhi yah samaj main nahin aata ki yah ashtani rachana vinasht hone se kaise bachi
 Similarly, there is also doubt as to where the iron came from in the Akundrite Awesome Meteor and how Kaunduyul was formed in the Kondrite Awesome Meteor
 ek anya mat main yah prastaavit kiya gaya he ki ulkapindon kii utpatti grahon ke saath saath ho hui, athwa yon kahana chahie ki soramandal evam samast khamandaleey padaartho kii utpatti ulkapindon se hi hui
 According to this fantasy, the primordial world was full of meteorites and in time, those bodies gathered in different masses and according to their maximum density, gasamic noharica, constellations and planets were born
 is kalpana kii ek badi truti yah prathit hoti he ki khamandal main upasthit ulkapind itani dur-dur chhitaraaye hue hai tathaa unka parsparik aakarshan itnaa ksheen he ki unke ekatra hokar badi raashi banane main atyadhik samay lagegaa
 But there is no doubt that once a sufficiently large amount of money is formed, it will be able to retain its power and will eventually increase its size by adding more bodies
 sambhav he, uparyukt vidhiyon main anshat: sanshodhan karne se inaki utpatti kii vaastavik vidhi nirdhaarit ho sake

 Muay Thai evolved in Thailand from Muay Boran, a type of unarmed boxing that was probably used by Symese soldiers when they lost their weapons in battle and remained unarmed
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki pracheen syamiz sena ne krabi crabong kii hathiyaar-aadhaarit kala se may boron kaa nirmaan kiya, lekin kuch anya logon kaa maananaa he ki in donon shaileyon kaa vikaas sambhavatya ek saath hi hua he
 Yet Krabi Krabong has greatly influenced Mu Boran and Muay Thai, an influence that can be seen in the many kicks, holds, and motions at Wai Khru that developed into armed conflict
 may boron ko or isiilie may thai ko mul rup se toi may yaa sirf may kaha jaataa tha
 As well as being a practical combat technique used in actual warfare, Muay became a game in which opponents fought in front of spectators who would watch this battle for entertainment

 The most popular folklore related to Maya Boron is the story of Nai Khanomtom
 1767 main ayuthaya kii pracheen siam rajdhani ke patan ke samay, akramanakari burmese sainya dalon ne hazaron thai logon ko bandhak bana liya or unhen kaidi bana kar burma le gaye
 These included a large number of Thai kickboxers, who were taken to the city of Ava
 1774 main, burma ke rangoon shahar main, burma ke raja haseenbushin ne buddha ke avasheshon ke sammaan main saat din or saat raat ke ek dharmik utsav ke aayojan kaa faisla liya
 The festival featured a variety of entertainment aids, such as plays in special costume called likées, comedic performances and matches of slapstick and sword fighting
 ek bindu par, raja haseenbushin yah dekhnaa chahta tha ki may boron kii tulana kaise burmese kala lethevei ke saath kii ja sakati he
 Nai Khanomtom was chosen to fight against the Burmese champions
 boxing ring ko singhaasana ke saamne banaaya gaya or naai khanomathome ne apane shikshakon or purvajon ke prati sammaan prakat karne ke liye ladaai se pehle ek paaramparik vaai kru nrity kiya, saath hi apane pratidwandvi ke aas paas nrity karke darshakon ke prati bhi sammaan kaa pradarshan kiya
 This surprised the Burmese people, they were confused, they thought it was black magic
 jab ladaai shuru hui, nai khanomathome ne panch, kik, kohni or ghutane kaa prayog karte hue apane pratidwandvi par tab tak prahaar kiya, jab tak vah post nahin ho gaya
 However the Burmese referee stated that the Burmese champion was too distracted by the kick and the knockout was declared invalid
 tab raja ne kaha ki nai khanomathome ko apane aap ko sabit karne ke liye burma ke nau champiyanon se ladanaa hoga
 He agreed and fought each other one by one without resting in between
 uskaa antim pratidwandvi raakhine se kickboxing kaa ek mahaan shikshak tha
 Nai Khanomtom injured him with his kicks, after which no one else dared to challenge him
 raja mangara itnaa prabhavit hua ki usne kathith taur par tippanee kii, "thai kaa har hissaa vish se paripurna he
 Despite being unarmed, he can beat nine to ten rivals
 lekin unka swami aksham tha or usne dushman ke liye apane desh ko kho diya
 Had he been able, it could not have happened that Ayutthaya city would have collapsed
 raja mangara ne nai khanomathome ko swatantra kar diya, saath hi use apane liye dhan yaa do sundar patniyon main se ek vikalp chunane ke liye bhi kaha
nai khanomathome ne patniyon ko chunaa kyonki usne bataaya ki dhan to aasaani se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 After this he went to Siam with his wives
 is kahani ke anya sanskarnon ke anusaar uski jeet ke parinamswaroop uske saathi thai kaidiyon ko bhi reeha kar diya gaya tha
 In honor of him and Mu Boran, the celebration of his victory is celebrated every year on March 17 as Boxer Day or National Muay Boran Day
 vartmaan main kuch log nai khanomathome kii is prasidd katha ko raja naresoun se sambandhit karte hai, jise ek baar burmese le gaye the
 However, Nai Khanomtom and King Naresoun took place in two different centuries
 aupchaarik may thai takneekon ko do samoohon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he: mei maai yaa mukhya takneekein or look maai yaa laghu takneekein
 Muay Thai is often a fighting art of attrition, in which opponents exchange currencies with each other
 yah nishchit rup thailand main paaramparik khiladiyon main prachlit he, lekin samakaleen vishwa main kam lokapriy kala he jahaan mudra ke liye mudra ke aadan pradaan kii thai style adhik anukool nahin he
 Almost all of Muay Thai's techniques use full body movements, rotating the hips with every kick, punch, elbow and block
 may thai main panch takanic mul rup se kaaphi simit he, jisamen sidhi bhujaa se lanbaa gol prahaar kiya jaataa he or hatheli kii hill se landing kii jaati he
 a full range of western boxing punches are now used by hybridizing with western boxing and western martial arts: lead job, straight / cross, hook, uppercut, shovel and corkscrew punch and overhands, as well as hammer fists and back fists
 adhikansh anya striking marshall arts kii tulana main, may thai main bodi panching kaa upyog ek ranneeti ke rup main kam kiya jaataa he, taaki prahaar karne vaale ke sir ko ghutanon or albo ke counter praharon se bachaaya ja sake
 In order to use the range of target points, in keeping with the central line principle, the competitor may use Western or Thai currency, which helps to effectively make long or short range strikes without compromising protection
 is
 kohni kaa upyog kai tareeke se prahaar karne vaale ek hathiyaar ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he: diagonal apwards, diagonal-downwards, aprakat, downward, baikward-spinning or flaaing
 From the side it can be used as a finishing move or to cut an opponent's eyebrow in such a way that blood can block his or her vision
 diagonal albo kisi anya prahaar se tej hoti hai lekin kam shaktishaalee hoti hai
 There is a clear distinction between a single elbow and a follow-up elbow
 single albo ek aisa prahaar he jo kisi anya prahaar se swatantra he, jabaki pholo-ap albo samaan bhujaa se kiya jane vaala doosraa prahaar he, jisamen pehla prahaar hook yaa street panch hota he, jiske baad albo pholo-ap kaa prahaar kiya jaataa he
 Such elbow strikes and other elbow strikes are used when the distance between the opponents is too short and there is too little space for the hook to strike the opponent's head
 kohni ke prahaar kaa upyog pratidwandvi ke prahaar ko block karne, usase apni raksha karne or uske prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye spring ni, said bodi ni, bodi kik yaa panch
 The two most common kicks in Muay Thai are called thip and te chiang or angle kick
 may thai kii angel kik main puure sharir kii ek ghurnan gati kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or ise anya marshall arts ke peshewaron ke dwaara bhi vyapak rup se apanaaya gaya he
 It is superficially similar to karate's round house kick, but does not have the rotation of the lower leg from the knee, which is used in most karate and other striking martial arts such as taekwondo
 kyonki kukushin, goju or kenpo main ise ek gol mudra main kiya jaataa he, jisamen peeche vaali taang, apper bodi fiting kii tulana main thodi si peeche hoti he
 This increases the risk in contrast to karate and taekwondo, with the exception of a few moments after a kick, for example
 angel kik main bal puri tarah se sharir; kulhon kii ghurnan gati ke dwaara lagaaya jaataa he
 It is thought that many opponents use counter rotation of the arm to intensify the ability of this kick, but the potential actually comes from the hips and the arms are placed in the stated position
 agar ek pratidwandvi ke dwaara round house kik maari gayi he, thai boxr aamtaur par kik kii jaanch karegaa or apni shin se is kik ko block karegaa
 thai boxr ko hameshaa shin se jude rahane kaa prashikshan diya jaataa he
 The foot has many small bones and is weak
 ek pratiyogi agar apane pair se yaa inastep prahaar karne kii koshish karata he to vah apane aap ko chot se bachaa saktaa he
 Muay Thai also includes many other types of kicks, such as side kicks and spinning back kicks
 This type of kick is used by some competitors only in bouts
 ek likhit strot ke anusaar, yah takanic khao dot yaa khao loi kii tulana main adhik aadhunik he
 It is believed that when Thai boxers fought with rope-tied hands instead of modern boxing gloves, this particular technique was used viciously in cutting, slicing and sawing by a conscious opponent
 jabaki saamne vaala pratidwandvi "rassi ke dastaane" ke tej kinaaron se is prahaar ko roktaa tha, kabhi kabhi rassi ko pani main bhigo kar geela kar liya jaataa tha taaki rassi or adhik majboot ho jaye
 yah vivaran neeche die gaye kuch ghutanon ke praharon ke liye bhi satya he
 Foot-thrust or literally foot-jab is one of Muay Thai's techniques
 iskaa upyog mukhya rup se hamalon ko block karne arthath rokane ke liye or duuri ko niyantrit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The foot-thrust should be thrown very fast but at the same time it should be strong enough to disturb the opponent's balance
 pashchimi boxing main donon pratidwandviyon ko us samay alag kar diy jaataa he jab ve ek duusare ko jakad lete hai; may thai main, haalanki, aisa nahin kiya jaataa he
 Knee and elbow techniques are used in this tightness or clinch
 aakraamak or rakshaatmak donon prayojanon ke liye pratidwandvi par prahaar karne or use rokane ke liye, clinch main kam maatra main stand-ap grapeling kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The front clinch is used with the palm of one hand on the back of the other
 is baat ke teen kaaran hai ki anguliyon kaa istemaal kyon nahin kiya janaa chahie
1) ring main pratidwandvi dastaane pahane hote hai, isliye ve apni anguliyon kaa upyog nahin kar sakate
 2) thai front clinch main pratidwandvi ke sir ko neeche kii ore dabaaya jaataa he, yah tab aasaan hota he jab haath gardan ke peeche naa hokar sir ke peeche band hon
 iske alaava bhujaaon ke dwaara gardan par jahaan tak sambhav ho sake adhiktam dabaav daalaa janaa chahie
 3) agar koi pratidwandvi anguliyon kaa istemaal karata he to uski anguliyon par chot lag sakati he or saamne vaale pratidwandvi ke sir par teji se kohni kaa prahaar karne ke liye pakad bananaa adhik mushkil ho jaataa he
 In a correct clinch the contestant presses the opponent's collar bone with the front of his arm, this time with his hands not around the opponent's neck but around his head
 is clinch se baahar nikalne kaa ek saamaanya tarika he, pratidwandvi ke sir ko peeche kii ore dhakka dena yaa kohni kaa prahaar karnaa, kyonki clinch ke liye donon pratiyogiyon kaa ek duusare ke bahut paas hona jaruri hota he
 Additionally, an ineffective clincher may try to "float" its arms downward and into the opponent's clinch, making the ineffective clincher an effective clincher

 It is said about the Mahabharata that it was written by speaking to Ganesha of Maharishi Ved Vyasa
 vedavyas mahabharat ke rachayita hi nahin, balki un ghatnaon ke sakshi bhi rahe hai, jo krmanusaar ghatit hui hai
 Information about all the activities of Hastinapur from his ashram used to reach him
 ve un ghatnaon par apana paraamarsh bhi dete the
 Whenever there was a situation of conflict and crisis, Mother Satyavati used to invite him to the ashram for discussion, sometimes in the Raj Bhavan of Hastinapur
 prayek dwapar yug main vishnu vyas ke rup main avatarit hokar vedon ke vibhaag prastut karte hai

 ) According to mythology, there was a king named Sudhanwa in ancient times
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi ek baar parashar muni ko uski naav par baith kar yamuna paar karnaa padaa
 Parashar Muni Satyavati became enamored of beauty and said, "devi! i want to cum with you
 " satyavati ne kaha, "muniver! aap brahmagyani hai or main nishad kanya
 We do not have sex
 " tab parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " itnaa kah kar unhone apane yogabal se chaaron ore ghaney kuhare kaa jaal rach diya or satyavati ke saath bhoga kiya
 After that, while blessing him, he said, the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrant
 " When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas
 hindu dharm shastron ke anusaar maharishi vyas trikalgya the
 And seeing from the divine point of view, he knew that religion would be weakened in Kali Yuga
 dharm ke ksheen hone ke kaaran manushya naastik, kartavyaheen or alpaayu ho jaavenge
 Sangopang study of a huge Veda will be out of their power
 isiliye maharishi vyas ne veda kaa chaar bhaagon main vibhaajan kar diya jisase ki kam buddhi evam kam smaranshakti rakhane vaale bhi vedon kaa adhyayan kar saken
 Vyas Ji named him - Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 vedon kaa vibhaajan karne ke kaaran hi vyas ji veda vyas ke naam se vikhyath huye
 Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda taught their disciples Pal, Jaimin, Vaishampayan and Sumantumuni respectively
 veda main nihit gyaan ke atyant gudh tathaa shushk hone ke kaaran veda vyas ne paanchave veda ke rup main puraanon kii rachana kii jinamein veda ke gyaan ko rochak kathaon ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 He taught the Puranas to his disciple Rome Harshan
 vyas ji ke shishyone apni apni buddhi ke anusaar un vedon kii anek shakhaayen or up shakhaayen bana deen
 Vyas Ji composed the Mahabharata
 puranic-mahakavy yug kii mahaan vibhuti, mahabharat, attharah puraana, shrimadbhagwat, brahmasutra, mimasaa jaise adwitiya sahitya-darshan ke praneta vedavyas kaa janm asadha poornima ko lagbhag 3000 i

 The Shrimad Bhagwat Gita is part of the world's largest epic 'mahabharata'
 ramnagar ke kile main or vyas nagar main vedavyas kaa mandir he jahow magh main prayek somvaar mela lagata he
 The famous festival of Guru Purnima is celebrated to commemorate the birth anniversary of Vyas ji
 puraanon tathaa mahabharat ke rachayita maharishi kaa mandir vyasapuri main vidyaman he jo kaashi se paanch mile kii duuri par sthit he
 In the Ramnagar fort of Maharaja Kashi Naresh, there is a statue of Vyeshwar in the western part, which is known by the common people as Chhota Ved Vyas
 vastav main vedavyas kii yah sab se pracheen murti he
 Visvesvara expelled Vyasji from Kashi due to Vyasji cursing Kashi
 tab vyasaji lolark mandir ke aagney kone main gangaji ke purvi tat par sthit hue
 The mention of this incident in Kashi section is as follows- lolarkadan agnidigbhage, swarghuni purvarodhsi

 Skanda Purana, Kashi Block 96 / 201 vyasaji ne puraanon tathaa mahabharat kii rachana karne ke pashchaat brahmasutron kii rachana bhi yahan kii thi
 Like Valmiki, Vyas is also a derivative of Sanskrit poets
 mahabharat main upakhyanon kaa anusaran kar anek sanskrit kaviyon ne kavy, naatak aadi kii sristi kii he
 In relation to the Mahabharata itself, Vyasji's statement is more accurate - what is in this text is elsewhere, but what is not in it is nowhere else
 kalapi main yamuna ke kisi dweep main inkaa janm hua tha
 Vyasji was called Krishna Dwaipayana because his color was black
 ve paidaa hote hi maan kii ajna se tapasya karne chale gayi the or kah gayi the ki jab bhi tum samaran karogi, main aa jaaoongaa
 He was not only the father of Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidur, but he also supported the Pandavas in the form of a shadow in times of calamity
 unhone teen varshon ke athak parishram se mahabharat granth kii rachana kii thi- Tribhirvarshe: Sadotthayi Krishnadvaipayanomuni:
 mahabharatamakhyaanan kritvaadi mudtamam
 
 adiparv - When he saw the deterioration of religion, he made Vyasa, the department of Veda, and called Ved Vyas
 vedon kaa vibhaag kar unhone apane shishy sumantu, jaimini, pel or vaishampayan tathaa putr shukdev ko unka adhyayan karaayaa tathaa mahabharat kaa upadesh diya
 Because of your supernatural talent, you are considered an incarnation of God
 sanskrit sahitya main valmiki ke baad vyas hi sarvshereshth kavi hue hai
 His poetry is known by the name of 'arsha Kavya'
 vyas ji kaa uddeshy mahabharat likh kar yuddh kaa varnan karnaa nahin, balki is bhautik jivan kii ni:sarataa ko dikhaanaa he
 His statement is that even if a man gets to know the Vedang and the Upanishads, he can never be learned because this Mahabharata is simultaneously economics, theology and kamshastra

 vishvavidhyalay ke faillo kalakatta ORCID is a nonproprietary alphanumeric code to uniquely identify scientific and other academic authors
 This addresses the problem that a particular author's contribution to the scientific literature can be hard to electronically recognize as most personal names are not unique, they can change, have cultural differences in name order, contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations and employ different writing systems
 It provides a persistent identity for humans, similar to that created for content-related entities on digital networks by digital object identifiers
 The ORCID organization offers an open and independent registry intended to be the de facto standard for author identification in science and related academic publishing
 On 16 oktober 2012, ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers
 ORCID was first organized as the "open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative"
 a prototype was developed on software adapted from that used by Thomson Reuters for its researcherid system
 The registry is now an independent nonprofit organization, ORCID, Inc
, incorporated in August 2010
 Its Executive Director, Laure Haak, was appointed in April 2012
 ORCID is freely usable and interoperable with other ID systems
 ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers on 16 October 2012
 Formally, ORCID ids are specified as uris, for example, the ORCID for John Wilbanks is http: / / orcid
org / xxrep 4 0 -0002-4510-0385
 However, some publishers use the short form, eg "ORCID: xxrep 4 0 -0002-4510-0385"
 ORCID is a subset of the International Standard Name Identifier, under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization and the two organizations are cooperating
 ISNI will uniquely identify contributors to books, television programmes, and newspapers, and has reserved a block of identifiers for use by ORCID, in the range xxrep 4 0 -0001-5000-0007 to xxrep 4 0 -0003-5000-0001
 It is therefore possible for a person to legitimately have both an ISNI and an ORCID - effectively, two isnis
 Both ORCID and ISNI use 16-character identifiers, using the digits 0-9, and separated into groups of four by hyphens
 The final character, which may also be a letter "X" representing the value "10", is a MOD 11-2 check digit conforming to the ISO / IEC 7064: 2003 standard
 An ORCID account for a fictitious person, Josiah Carberry, exists as http: / / orcid
org / xxrep 4 0 -0002-1825-0097, for use in testing and training examples
 The aim of ORCID is to aid "the transition from science to e-science, wherein scholarly publications can be mined to spot links and ideas hidden in the ever-increasing volume of scholarly literature"
 Another suggested use is to provide each researcher with "a constantly updated 'digital curriculum vitae' providing a picture of his or her contributions to science going far beyond the simple publication list
" The idea is that other organizations will use the open-access ORCID database to build their own services
 It has been noted in an editorial in Nature that ORCID, in addition to tagging the contributions that scientists make to papers, "could also be assigned to data sets they helped to generate, comments on their colleagues’ blog posts or unpublished draft papers, edits of Wikipedia entries and much else besides"
 In April 2014, ORCID announced plans to work with the Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information to record and acknowledgments to peer review
 By the end of 2013 ORCID had 111 member organizations and over 460,000 registrants
 As of 30 may 2014, the number of registrants was 727,454
 The organizational members include many publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, Wiley and Nature Publishing Group
 Others are research institutions, commercial companies including Thomson Reuters, academic societies and a charitable foundation, the Wellcome Trust
 In June 2014, ORCID announced that it had appointed Andy Mabbett as its Wikipedian in Residence
 In addition to members and sponsors, a number of journals, publishers, and other services have included ORCID in their workflows or databases
 For example, the Journal of Neuroscience, Springer Publishing, the Hindawi Publishing Corporation, Europe pubmed Central, the Japanese National Institute of Informatics's Researcher Name Resolver, Wikipedia, and Wikidata
 Some online services have created tools for exporting date to, or importing data from, ORCID
 These include Scopus and Figshare
 Thomson Reuters has enabled data exchange between ORCID and its researcherid system, and vice versa
 Third-party tools allow the migration of content from other services into ORCID, for example ODIN, for datacite and mendeley2orcid, for Mendeley
 Some ORCID data may also be retrieved as RDF

 In Hinduism, apocalypticism in the context of Vedas is the belief that the Vedas are 'apaurusheya' meaning that no one has created the Vedas - neither man nor any divine power
 vedon ko 'apaurushey shabd' se bhi kehete hai
 The emergence of the Vedas has a great significance in the opinion of the Nyayikas and the Tsuddin philosophers, especially the Mimansakas
 nyaay kaa mat he ki ishwar dwaara rachit hone ke kaaran veda 'paurushey' he, parantu sankhya, vedant or mimasaa mat main veda kaa unmesh swat: hi hota he; uske liye kisi bhi vyakti kaa, yahan tak ki sarvajna ishwar kaa bhi praytn kaarysadhak nahin he

 taittiriya, kathak aadi naamon kaa sambandh bhinn-bhinn vaidic samhitaon ke saath avashya miltaa hai, parantu yah akhya pravachan ke kaaran hi hai, granthrachana ke kaaran nahin 
 Words similar to Babar Pravahini, etc
, available in the Vedas, are instructive of continual matter rather than a signifier of any particular person

 Such actions operate on a time table governed by US law
 vaanijya vibhaag ne niyamit rup se yah paaya he ki america bazaar main utpaadon ko uchit mulya se kam par bechaa gaya he
 If the domestic industry is able to decide that it is being harmed through dumping, antidumping duty is charged on goods imported from the dumping country by accounting for a percentage rate on the dumping margin as a response
 antimping duty kaa sandarbh "pratikaari shulkon" se he
 The difference is that the countervailing duty needs to balance the damaging exemption, while the antidumping duty balances the harmful dumping
 kuch tippaneekaron ne yah ullekh kiya he ki gharelu sangrakshanvaad or videshi utpaadan laagat ke sandarbh main jaankaree kii kami apratyaashit sansthagat prakriya ke aasapaas jaanch kaa kaaran banati he
 WTO members can file complaints against antidumping measures
 agar ek company kisi utpaada ko apane khud ke gharelu bazaar main saamaanya rup se iske mulya kii tulana main ek kam keemat par niryaat karti he to ise us utpaada kii "damping" karnaa kehete hai
 Opinions vary as to whether this is an unfair competition but action is taken by many governments against dumping in order to protect their domestic industries
 vishwa vyapaar sanghathan samjhauta faisle ko paas nahin karata he
 Its focus remains on how governments may or may not react to dumping - it disciplines anti-dumping actions and is often referred to as an "anti-dumping agreement"
 kanoonee paribhaashaayen kahin adhik sateek rahi hai lekin mote taur par kehete hai ki vishwa vyapaar sanghathan samjhauta sarkaron ko us sthiti main damping ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii anumati detaa he jahaan pratispardhi gharelu udyog ko asli nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya hota he
 In order to do this, the government has to be able to show that dumping is actually taking place, as well as to calculate the level of dumping and show that dumping is causing damage or posing a threat 
 jabaki vishwa vyapaar sanghathan kii sweekruti se, general agreement on tarriff and trade deshon ko damping ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa vikalp chunane kii anumati detaa he
 The anti-dumping Agreement clarifies and extends Article VI and both work together
 ye deshon ko is tarah kaary karne kii anumati dete hai jisase ki ek badhyakaari shulk rakhane or vyapaar ke bhagidaaron ke bich bhedbhaav nahin rakhane sambandhi gat ke siddhant kaa aam taur par ulanghan hota he - vishesh rup se anti-damping karrwai kaa matlab kisi khaas niryaatak desh kii kisi khaas vastu par isaki keemat ko "uchit mulya" ke kareeb laane yaa ayatak desh main gharelu udyog ko hone vaale nuksaan ko dur karne ke kram main is par atirikt aayaat shulk lagaana he
 There are several ways to calculate whether a particular product is being dumped in large quantities or only a small amount
 samjhauta sambhavit vikalpon ke antar ko kam se kam kar detaa he
 It provides three ways to calculate the "fair value" of a product
 sabase pramukh tarika niryaatak ke gharelu bazaar main maujuuda mulya par aadhaarit he
 When it cannot be used, two other options are available - on the basis of jointly calculating the price taken by the exporter in another country or the difference in the cost of production of the exporter, other expenses and general profit
 At the same time the agreement also dictates how a fair comparison can be made between the export price and what would be a normal price
 kisi utpaada par damping kii had kaa hisaab-kitaab laga lenaa hi paryaapt nahin he
 Anti-dumping measures can be implemented only when the dumping importer is harming the industry in the country
 Therefore, a detailed investigation is done as per the rules specified earlier
 jaanch main un sabhi praasangik aarthik pahaluon kaa aavashyak rup se moolyankan kiya jaataa he jinka sambandhit udyog ke pradesh main koi prabhaav padataa he
 If the investigation shows that dumping is taking place and the domestic industry is being harmed, the exporting company may take measures to raise its price to an agreed level in order to avoid anti-dumping import duties
 anti-damping maamalon ko kaise niptaya jaae, jaanch kii prakriya kisi puri kii jaae or yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki sabhi icchhuk partiyon ko apane pramaan prastut karne kaa ek mauqaa diya gaya he, iske liye vistrut prakriyaayein nirdhaarit kii gayi hai
 Anti-dumping measures necessarily expire five years after the date of its implementation unless a review suggests that the termination of this measure may cause harm
 anti-damping jaanch un maamalon ko turant samaapt karne ke liye hote hai jahaan adhikariyon dwaara yah tay kiya jaataa he ki damping kaa margin kam se kam he yaa ullekhneey dhang se kam he 
 anya sharten bhi nirdhaarit kii gayi hai
 For example, even if the quantity of dumped imports is negligible, the case is investigated to end the dispute settlement process
 europea sangh kii anti-damping europea parishad ke daayre ke tahat aati he
 It is governed by European Council Regulation 384 / 96
 haalanki, anti-damping karravaayiyon kaa karyanvayan sadsy rajya ke pratinidhitiv ke saath vibhinn samitiyon dwaara matdaan ke baad kiya jaataa he
 The official body responsible for advising member states on anti-dumping actions is the Directorate General of Trade located in Brussels
 saamudayik udyog ek anti-damping jaanch shuru karne ke liye aavedan kar saktaa he
 The Director General of Trade first investigates the claims of the complainants
 agar unhen saamudayik udyog ke kam se kam 25% kaa pratinidhitiv miltaa he to sambhawatah jaanch shuru ho jaayegi
 yah prakriya niyamavaliyon main maujuud kuch vishisht maargdarshan dwaara nirdeshit he
 a recommendation will be made by the Director General of Trade to a committee known as the anti-dumping Advisory Committee, on which each member state has one vote
 sadsy rajya ke matdaan main bhaag nahin lene ko yah mana jayega kii usne audyogic suraksha ke paksh main matdaan kiya he, jo ek aisi matdaan pranali he jise kaaphi aalochana ke daayre main laayaa gaya he
 The eu's anti-dumping actions are primarily considered a part of the "trade protection" portfolio according to the criteria set to begin the investigation
 jaanch ke dauraan upabhokta hiton or gaiyr-udyog se sambandhit hiton par jor nahin diya jaataa he
 Any investigation specifically takes into account the damage caused to community manufacturers by dumping, and the level of fixed fees is determined based on the damage caused to community manufacturers through dumping
 agar aam sahmati nahin milti he to faisla europea parishad ke paas chalaa jaataa he
 When applied, the fee is theoretically valid for five years
 vyaavhaarik taur par ye kam se kam ek varsh tak lagu rahete hai kyonki samaapti kii samiksha aam taur par paanch varsh ke ant main shuru hoti he or samiksha prakriya dauraan yathasthiti kaayam rakhi jaati he
 The dumping investigation essentially compares the domestic prices of the charged dumping nation with the imported product prices in the European market
 haalanki damping margin kii gananaa karne se pehle aankadon par kai tarah ke niyam lagu hote hai
 The most controversial is the concept of "parallel market"
 kuch niryaatak deshon ko europea sangh dwaara "bazaar arthvyavastha kaa darja" nahin diya jaataa he: china iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan he
 In such cases the Director General of Trade is barred from using domestic prices as a reasonable measure of domestic value
 ek vishesh niryaatak udyog bhi bazaar kaa darja kho saktaa he agar vyapaar mahanideshak dwaara yah nishkarsh nikaala jaataa he ki is udyog ko sarkari sahaayta praapt hoti he
 Other applicable tests include the application of international accounting standards and bankruptcy laws
 bazaar arthvyavastha kaa darja nahin die jane ke parinaam swarup jaanch prakriya par ek vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 For example, if China is accused of dumping widgets, then the basic approach is to consider the value of widgets in China against the value of Chinese widgets in Europe
 lekin china ko bazaar arthvyavastha kaa darja hasil nahin he isiliye chini kii gharelu keemton ko sandarbh ke rup main istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Instead, the Director General of Trade essentially has to decide on the basis of a parallel market: a market that enjoys market economy status and is substantially similar to China
 iske liye brazil or mexico prayog kiya gaya he, lekin sanyukt rajya america ek lokapriy samanaantar bazaar he
 In this case the value of widgets in the United States is considered as an alternative to the value of widgets in China
 ek samanaantar bazaar chunane kii yah prakriya shikayatakarta ke prabhaav ke adheen he jisane kuch aisi aalochanaon ko janm diya he ki yah prakriya main ek nihit purvaagrah he
 However, China is one of the countries where labor force is the cheapest
 aalochanaon ke anusaar china kii vastuon ke mulya kii tulana sanyukt rajya america ke saath ek samanaantar rup main karnaa kaaphi had tak anuchit he
 China, unlike its well-planned economy in the early 60s, is now developing into a relatively more independent and open market, with the Chinese market more and more willing to embrace global competition
 isiliye ise apane "damping" aacharan kaa akalan karne ke liye apni sthiti ko sudhaarney or ek uchit rup se tay kiya gaya mulya str taiyaar karne ke kram main apane bazaar ke niyamon ko sudhaarney or mukt vyapaar kii baadhaon par vijay praapt karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy has often been accused of dumping although significant reform measures as a part of the agricultural agreement in the 1992 Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations and subsequent incremental reforms, particularly in the 2003 Luxembourg Agreement
 Were prepared
 shuruyaat main cap ne europea krishi utpaadan ko badhaane or ek vishesh kosh - europea krishi maargdarshan or guarantee kosh - ke madhyam se bazaar ke hastkshep kii prakriya ke jariye europea kisaanon ko sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye, mulya ke kendriya taur par ek nishchit nirdhaarit str se neeche gir jane kii sthiti main atirikt krishi utpaadan ko kharidne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Through this measure European farmers were given a "guaranteed price" in the event of selling their produce in the European Community
 is aantarik upaay ke atirikt ek niryaat sambandhi dhan kii vaapasi kii vyavastha ne yah sunishchit kiya ki europea samudaay ke baahar beche jane vaale europea utpaada ko vaishvik mulya yaa isse kam par bechaa jayega taaki europea nirmaataa ko isse koi nuksaan naa pahunche
 This policy was heavily criticized for distorting world trade and since the 1992 policy, this policy has been moved away from the direction of market intervention and efforts to pay farmers directly, regardless of production
 iske alaava aam taur par bhugtanon ke liye kisaanon ko kuch khaas paryaavaran yaa pashu kalyaan sambandhi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaataa he jisase ki ek jimmedaar, dirghakaalik kheti ko protsaahit kiya ja sake jise "bahuuddeshy" krishi sabsidi kaha jaataa he - yani jahaan sabsidi ke jariye saamaajik, paryaavarniya or anya laabh die jate hai jisamen utpaadan main ek saadhaaran vruddhi shaamil nahin hoti he

 baaki main ek satat vistrut shrenee dikhaai di or inhen sitaron kaa ek samooh mana gaya
 In 1912, a third category was added when Vesto Slifer demonstrated that the nebulae around the Meropee star resembled the Pleiades open starfish
 is prakaar niharika taron ke prativimvit prakaash dwaara chamakta he
 Slifer and Edwin Hubble continued to collect a wide range of these from several diffused nebulae and discovered that 29 of these showed emission spectra and 33 had continuous spectra of starlight
 1922 main habal ne ghoshnaa kii ki lagbhag sabhi niharikaayen sitaron se judy hai or unki roshni taron ke prakaash se aati he
 They also discovered that nebulae in the emission spectrum are almost always warmer than B1 or more, whereas nebulae with continuous spectra appear with relatively cold stars
 habal or henry noris rasel donon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki garm taron ke aasapaas kii niharikaayen kisi na kisi prakaar se parivartit ho rahi hai
 Many nebulae are formed due to the mutual gravity of the gas in the interstellar medium
 apane nijee bhaar ke tahat dravya ke sankuchit hone kii vajah se centre main anek vishaal sitaron kaa gathan ho saktaa he or unka parabangnee prakaash aasapaas kii gaison ko ynit kar prakaash tarangon par unhen drushtigochar banaata he
 Rosette Nebiel and Pelicon Nebiel are examples of such nebulae
 HII kshetra ke naam se parichit is prakaar kii niharikaon kaa aakaar, gas ke vaastavik badalon ke aakaar par nirbhar hota he
 This is where stars are formed
 isse gathit sitaron ko kabhi-kabhi ek yuva, deele cluster ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Some nebulae are formed as a result of explosions in supernovae, ie the end of large and short-gv stars
 supernova ke visphot se bikharanevaali saamagree urja dwaara ynit hoti he or isse nirmit ho sakanevaali thos vastu kaa gathan hota he
 The Crab Nebula of Taurus constellation is the best example of this
 varsh 1054 main supernova kii ghatana darj kii gayi or ise or SN1054 ke rup main chihnit kiya gaya
 The solid object formed after the explosion is located in the center of the Crab Nebule and is a neutron star
 anya niharikaayen grahiy niharikaon kaa gathan kar sakati hai
 Like the Earth's sun, it is the last phase of the life of a low-mass mass star
 8-10 saura dravyaman vaale taare laal daanav taron ke rup main viksit hote hai or apane vaataavaran main spandan ke dauraan dhire-dhire apni baheri parat kho dete hai
 When a star loses enough material, its temperature rises and the ultraviolet radiation emitted from it can ionize the nebula thrown around it
 niharika main avshisht saamagree sahit 97% hydrogen or 3% helium he
 The main goal of this phase is to achieve balance
 niharikaon ko chaar pramukh samoohon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Earlier galaxies and round galaxies were considered to be different types of practicals

 Diffuse nebulae near the stars are examples of reflection nebulae
 adhikansh niharikaon ko visarit niharikaayen kaha ja saktaa he, jiskaa arth he ki ve vistrut hai evam kisi sarvamaanya paribhaasha kii seemaa main nahin aatin
 In visible light, these nebulae can be divided into emission nebulae and reflection nebulae, based on how the visible light is composed to us
 utsarjan niharika main ayanit gas hota he, jo utsarjan kii dhundhlee rekha banaati hai
 These emission nebulae are often called HII fields, with the term "HII" often used for ionized hydrogen in commercial astronomy

 Dark or dark nebulae are the same as diffuse nebulae, but they cannot be seen by the light emitted or reflected by them
 Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of distant stars or emission nebulae
 haalanki ye niharikaayen prakaash tarangon par alag-alag dikhaai detii hai, par ve sabhi infrared yaa avarakt taragon par utsarjan ke ujjwal strot hai
 This emission mainly comes from the dust inside the nebulae

 These nebulae are emitting nebulae with blurred emission, similar to those of emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 takneekee taur par, yah HII kshetra hai kyonki adhiktar hydrogen ynit hoga
 However, planetary nebulae are more dense and more solid than emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 grahon kii niharikaon ko yah naam isliye diya gaya he kyonki jin pehle khagolavidon ne in vastuon kaa adhyayan kiya tha unhone sochaa ki niharikaayen grahon kii tastariyon yaa discon jaisi dikhti hai, haalanki, ve grahon se sanvandhit nahin hai
 a proto planetary nebula is an astronomical object, a short-lived episode of the rapid stellar gradual evolution of a star between the position of the former asymptomatic giant branch and the phase of the post-planetary nebula
 ek PPN shashakt avarakt vikiran utsarjit karata he or ek pratibimb niharika he
 The actual point of formation of a PPN planetary nebula is defined by the temperature of the central star
 jab ek hai-moss sitara apane jivan ke ant tak pahunch jaataa he tab supernova ghatit hota he
 When nuclear fusion stops at the star's core or center, the star disintegrates
