 muri kaa khel, jise baaj-bater khel yaa barf ke tile kaa khel bhi kaha jaataa he, khel siddhant main do pratidwandiyon ke bich hone vaala ek prakaar kaa sangharsh he
 In this , a competition starts between the two in which neither of them wants to retreat but both of them suffer a huge loss

 In biology it is called the 'game of hawk' and is seen in situations when the opponents can either cooperate or compete against the use of a common instrument

 jo hat jaataa he use hui haani main duusare kaa apmaan bhi shaamil hota he, kyonki doosraa bahadur lagata he jabaki hatane vaala darpok lagata he
 But if both of them keep thinking till the end, then both of them can suffer huge losses

 britani adhikariyon ne rajya kaa khazaana zabt kar liya or unke pati ke karz ko rani ke salanaa karch main se kaatane kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 As a result, the queen had to leave the fort of Jhansi and go to the Ranimahal of Jhansi
 par rani lakshmibai ne himmat nahin haari or unhonen har haal main jhansi rajya kii raksha karne kaa nishchay kiya

 To establish their rule in India, the officers of the East India Company thought in necessary to preserve the knowledge of Hindus and Muslims
 In the year 1750 they passed a resolution for that purpose
 To preserve Urdu, they established a Madarsa at Calcutta, whereas for protection and development of Sanskrit, they chose Benares
 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit college for development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favor of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation
 From 1857, the College started Postgraduate teaching
 The examination system was adopted in 1880
 In 1894 the famous building of Saraswati Bhavan Granthalaya, where thousands of manuscripts are preserved, was constructed, 
 These manuscripts are edited by the Principal of the College and published in book form
 The series of books are known as Sarasvati Bhavana Texts
 More than 400 books have been published in the series

 From 1791 to 1844 the college was governed by the Administrative officers of the city
 Later British officers decided that Indians should also obtain knowledge of European literature and Philosophy
 Therefore they ordered the appointment of a Principal for the college
 The qualification laid down was the Principal must be a scholar of Sanskrit with knowledge of European literature and philosophy
the Principals from 1844 were: shilappadikaaram tamil sahitya ke paanch shreshth mahakavyon main se ek he

 Only qualities like superiority of ideas, work inspired by the spirit of the interest of society and good behavior are helpful in making a man great
 inhen gunon ke kaaran sant raidas ko apane samay ke samaaj main atyadhik sammaan mila or isi kaaran aaj bhi log inhen shraddhapurvak samaran karte hai
 Raidas Manush could not join till caste was formed
