 If a given set of real or complex numbers: x, n जाता z { \ displaystyle x, \ ; n \ in \ mathbb {Z}}, then the DTFT of x { \ displaystyle x \ ,} is often expressed as is: x = ∑ n = − ∞ ∞ x e − i ω n 
 { \ displaystyle X= \ sum _{n=- \ infty }^{ \ infty }x \ ,e^{-i \ omega n}
} Discrete-time sequence will be regained after the following conversion: The integrals span one full period of the DTFT, which means that the x samples are also the coefficients of a Fourier series expansion of the DTFT
 Infinite limits of integration change the transform into a continuous-time Fourier transform, which produces a sequence of Dirac impulses
 That is: Below are some standard discrete time sequences and their dtfts

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics

 Tansen was born as a boon to the then famous Fakir Hazrat Muhammad Gaus of Gwalior at Shri Makrand Pandey in village Behat, about 45 km from Gwalior
 kehete he ki shri makrand pandey ke kai santane hui, lekin ek par ek akaal hi kaal kavlit hoti chali gai
 Frustrated and distressed by this, Shri Makarand Pandey went to the shelter of Sufi saint Muhammad Gaus and his blessings led to the birth of Tanna alias Tansukh alias Trilochan in 1486, which later became known as Tansen
 tansen ke aarambhik kaal main gwalior par kalapriy raja maansingh tomars kaa shashan tha

 akbar haridas se itane prabhavit hue ki waapas jaakar unhone tansen se akele main kaha ki aap to apane guru kii tulana main kahin aas-paas bhi nahin he
 Then Tansen replied that where we sing for the king of this land and our guru sings for the king of this universe, the difference will not be there

 Here are some incarnations of Gaushala: The essence of the history of Rama Krishna is Goshala, an element in Goshala, Smriti, Vedo, Upanishads
 
 Religion itself becomes a habit of being a cow, in the country, religion and Sanskrit is the definition of a cow shed
 
 i drank a little more then felt drunk, the drinker drank the cup on the cup and dried it
 
 But there is no restriction on drinking cow vigorously, the more you drink, the stronger the goshala
 
 Disappeared pitu-mat, the brothers all became sister-in-law, sister-in-law was alienated, Jag became alienated, God was angry, angry Allahtala
 
 Broken Gaushala strengthens all relations with the world, by adding easy affection to the drinker
 
 At the party, no matter who drinks a cup of tea, even if you empty the urn, why not drink it? 
 But if the dessert is not there, everything will be called in vain, the gaushala feeds us the mustard sweets in the alms
 
 Before me, behind me, right - left cow, outside me, whatever is inside me, just cow shed
 
 i am the cow of the cows, let me always have goodwill, so i am happier than Surpur, i am my cow 
 Religion is not my hindu-muslim religion; Goshala, karma and duty, work
 Daily Sab Gaushala
 
 The caste of Gobhakta is varna - Go, Gobind - of worshiper, in one word my complete, introduction, only - Goshala
 
 Hun, Yavan, Shaka, Mlechha erased and drank, drunk, and imbibed everyone's poison
 
 But on whose strength the caste is alive till today? 
 The orgy of Danujata also happened to shake the heart, the thunderbolt fell on the monasteries and the monasteries in the temple
 
 But the pennant and the safe cowshed did not bow down, the traitors did their own work of caste
 
 Forgiveting Ripu for seventeen times, Singh Bhola spear, blinded Kehri and did not let it flow
 
 But even with blind eyes, the cowshed, the fire test took place, the drunken drunkenness of patience
 
 Payyapi cut off his head, but the broken, broke but did not bow, who were those advanced heads? His - their, whom - whom he loved, the goshala, who left the country with him and took his face black? Those whose arms were on my lips and lips
 
 Country - Pride of caste who fought, died and were alive, in the heart of sons, was a rotating cow
 
 Just yesterday, the Asura lying in the Chittor fort was brought up, where is that extinguished flame of Jauhar
 
 The deity of the demons failed, the divine goddesses became immortal, the hands were rubbing alcohol, and the cow was glowing
 
 Ghori and Gajnavi lootera Allahdheen poisonous Kala, Bakhtiyar Aurangzeb Ripu - Darun Griever
 
 Green! Come on! There have been so many problems on Gaushala, everyone has been standing with grief, Goshala is standing
 
 Spear started with Dhar, Prithviraj, Saridarsha Nar Bapparaval from Ala, Rana Sanga and Pratap
 
 Rakshita Goshala from Chhatrasal, Gobind, Shiva, Vairagi Sam Veer, Tilak, Subhash Prabirti's sons
 
 Goshala on the page-page of my pride history, this gaushala in every particle of my beloved India mother
 
 i have covered the body of my blood and blood, i will disappear on that day when it will not remain
 
 This slash will go away, this blackness will be black, on the new morning it will fall on the ground, then with golden dreams
 
 Heaven - will be like a world experience, we will again have our own country, village - village house - the day the house will open

 luutherwaadi carch kii dharm pustika ke anusaar These religious rules warn that often the state of ecstasy, epileptic seizures, laziness, insanity, and mania are the result of natural causes and should not be mistaken to understand ghosts
 luutherwaadi carch ke anusaar bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii aavashyaktaa vaali bhoot-baadha ko ingit karne vaale lakshanon main shaamil he: The following symptoms have been listed by the Church as a secondary symptom - terrible screams, blasphemy of God, ridicule of neighbors, distortion in activities 9:20; Luck

 Once these are determined, the church is advised by an experienced physician to determine whether there is any medical interpretation of the person's behavior
 jab sahi myne main koi bhoot-baadha pahachaani jaati he, to peedit vyakti ko carch ke purohit kii dekhbhaal main rakhaa jaataa he, jo uchit dharm-siddhant kii shiksha detaa he, nishkalank jivan jeene vaala hota he, jo tuchh aarthik laabh ke liye kuch nahin karata kintu sab kuch aatma se karata he
 Then the priest has to diligently examine what kind of life the ghost-hounded person had lived till now and then the person is motivated to confess his sins through the law
 yah sab ho jane ke baad bhartsana athwa santvanaa dene kaa kaary hota he, prakritik chikitsak ke karyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo uchit prakaar kii dawa ke saath hanikaarak dravon dwaara bhoot-baadha se grast vyakti kii safai karegaa
 The Dharma booklet then states: methodist carch ke anusaar bhoot-pret ke apasaaran ke anushthan main shaamil he “dushtatma kii vastunishth shakti ko dur karnaa jisane kisi vyakti par adhikaar kar liya ho”
 iske atirikt, methodist carch bataata he ki “bhoot-apasaaran kaa adhikaar us rup main carch ko diya gaya jisamen isamsih kii ministry sansar main kaayam he”

 It is the belief of the Methodist Church that it is most important that the person seeking help be assured that the presence and love of Jesus is definitely available to him
 iske alaava “bible, prarthana tathaa sanskaar" kii ministry kaa vistaar in vyaktiyon tak bhi hona chahie
 The combination of these things has proved to be effective

 The most common of these is the liberation ritual
 Salvation is different from the exorcism of ghosts wherein the demon enters the person's life instead of completely subduing the person
 yadi vyakti ko purnat: vash main kar liya gaya ho to ek purna vidhivat bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However, a soulful Christian living on his faith cannot suffer from ghosts
 Under this belief structure, the reasons for the demon-infiltration can usually be interpreted as a deviation from the doctrine of theology, or may be due to pre-conversion deeds
 kisi vyakti ko mukti kii aavashyaktaa he yaa nahin iske nirdhaaran kii paaramparik vidhi kaa prayog kisi aise vyakti ko upasthit rakhkar kiya jaataa he jisamen atmaaon ko apsaarit karne kaa hunar ho
 It is a boon of the Holy Spirit from 1 Corinthians 12 that enables a person to feel the presence of a demon
 yadhyapi aarambhik nidaan ko praaia: sangat dwaara chunauti nahin di jaati, kintu jab ek hi sangat main aise bahut se vardaan praapt vyakti hon to parinaam alag-alag hote hai
 Francis Gabriel Amorth refers to such people as "sears and Sensitives" and uses them on many occasions; They have the ability to detect the presence of demons
 yadhyapi, vah note karte hai ki “ve hameshaa sahi nahin hote: unke anubhav kii jaanch avashya kii jaani chahie”
 unke udaahranon main, ve un ghatnaon kaa pataa lagane main sakasham hote hai jiske kaaran bhoot kaa pravesh hua he, athwa ve us dusht vastu ko dhudhane main sakasham hote hai jisane vyakti ko abhishaapit kiya he
 He writes that "he is always gracious
 ” In the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church, the exorcism is performed and performed by the clergy for all those considered to be buda or ghosts

 Superhuman strength, for example, breaking the bonds, as described in the New Testament — with Glossolella is also seen in a person with a ghost barrier
 amsaalu gileta, ek aadhunik cese study main, aise tattvon ke bare main bataate hai jo ithiopian isai bhoot-pret ke apasaaran main saamaanya hai: This includes singing of praise and victory songs, recitation of scriptures, prayer and confronting the soul with the name of Jesus
 Conversation with the soul is another important part of the ritual of exorcism
 yah bhoot-apsaarak ko yah jaanane main madad karata he ki bhoot-baadha se grast vyakti ke jivan main aatma kis prakaar kaary karti he
 The symptoms and events expressed by the soul are confirmed by the victim after liberation
 bhoot-pret kaa apasaaran hameshaa safal nahin hota or gileta duusare udhaaharan ke bare main bataate hai jisamen saamaanya vidhiyaan asafal ho gai thim or bhoot ne baad main jaakar peedit ko pratyaksh rup se choda
 kisi ghatana main, “sabhi maamalon main bhoot ko kisi or nahin balki yishu ke naam se aadesh diya jaataa he
 " bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii isai pratha aise vyakti ke liye hoti he jo gambhir maansik athwa shaareerik rog kii prakriya ke antargat he or bhoot-pret ke apasaaran ke anushthan kii aadhikarik sweekruti se purv rog ke maansik athwa shaareerik kaaran nahin hai, is baat kii pushti ke liye maansik or shaareerik chikitsakon kii niyukti kii jaati he
 When all possible causal causes are ruled out, the case is treated as an incurable ghost barrier and in this case, exorcism can be performed
 bhoot bhagane kabje ke lakshanon kaa anubhav logon par kaam karata he ki bhram ke kuta-bheshaj prabhaav or suzav kii shakti ko kuch logon dwaara jimmedaar tehraaya he
 In order to gain one's attention, some possessed individuals actually suffer from low narcissism and acting like narcissism or "demon possessed

 He concluded that the Christian concept of possession was a real event
 unhone kaha ki roman catholic carch dwaara istemaal un logon se kuch alag naidanik mandandon nikaali gai
 He also claimed to see differences in chandelier processes and progress

 Peck's earlier work was largely met with popular acceptance, his work and authority on subjects of evil generated significant debate and ridicule
 zyada pek lagaataar ek jhootha or jodtod martin kaha jaataa he ki is tathy ke baavjood vivaadaaspad malaki martin, ek roman catholic padri or ek purv jesuit ke saath apane sahyog ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 Other criticisms leveled against Peck included claims that he had crossed the boundaries of professional ethics in trying to persuade his patients to accept Christianity
 
 Ghost obstruction is not recognized by DSM-IV or ICD-10 as a valid psychological or medical diagnostic

 iske atirikt monomaniya kaa ek rup hota he jise demonomaniya athwa demonopathy kehete hai, jisamen rogi ko yah vishwaas ho jaataa he ki us par ek yaa adhik bhuton kaa prakope he
 The fact that exorcism works on people who experience the symptoms of ghost disturbance is considered by some to be an effect caused by the effects of pseudo-medicine and the power of counseling
 anumaanit bhoot-baadha se grast kuch log vastav main atmarati se athwa nimna atmasamman se grast hote hai tathaa logon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakrisht karne ke liye is prakaar kii harakatein karte hai maano ve "bhoot-baadha se grast vyakti" hon

 The waterfall model is a process of sequential software development in which the process of its development is seen as a regular downward flow through the stages of conceptualization, initialization, analysis, design, construction, testing, and maintenance
 saanchaa:software development process The model of waterfall development has its origins in the manufacturing and construction industries; Highly structured physical environment in which change is not impossible is very expensive
 chunki us samay aupchaarik software deveopment kaary-pranali kaa koi astitv nahin tha, isliye software deveopment ke liye is hardware-aadhaarit model ko sahajatapurvak apana liya gaya
 The earliest formal description of the waterfall model, usually Winston W
 It is quoted from an article published by Royce in 1970, although Royce did not use the noun 'waterfall' in this article
 royas ne is model ko ek trutipurna or bekaar model ke ek udhaaharan ke rup main pesh kiya tha
 This is the actual way to commonly use a noun in writing about software development - as a way of criticizing a commonly used software practice
 royas ke mul waterfol model main, krampurvak nimnlikhit charnon kaa anusaran kiya jaataa he: To follow the waterfall model, the individual moves from one stage to the next in a completely sequential manner
 udhaaharan ke liye, vyakti sabase pehle aavashyaktaaon ke vinirdesh ko puraa karata he jo stone main set hota he
 When the requirements are fully met, the person moves towards the design
 prashnmoolak software ko dizin kiya jaataa he or karyanvayankartaaon dwaara anusaran karne ke liye ek khaakaa taiyaar kiya jaataa he — die gaye aavashyaktaaon ke karyanvayan ke liye is dizin ko ek yojana kaa rup dena aavashyak he
 When the design is completed, the code writer undertakes the implementation of that design
 is karyanvayan charan ke baad ke charnon kii ore, alag se nirmit software ghatakon ko sanyojit kiya jaataa he taaki nai kaaryakshmata ko prastut kiya ja sake or trutiyon ko hataakar jokhim ko kam kiya ja sake
 Thus the waterfall model maintains that a person should move towards the next stage only when the previous stage has been completed and proven
 haalanki, aisi kai sanshodhit waterfol model hai jisamen is prakriya ke sandarbh main kam yaa adhik bhinnataaon kaa hona swaabhaavik he
 The time spent at the beginning of the software manufacturing cycle can lead to greater economy in the later stages
 aisa dikhaaya ja chukaa he ki praarambhik charnon main paaya gaya bag, prakriya main baad main paae gaye vaise hi bag kii tulana main paise, prayaas or samay kii drushti se fiks karne ke liye sasta hota he
 Take a step example, if a program design becomes impossible to implement then it is much easier to fix the design in the design phase than it is to realize it after months when the components of the program are being integrated because a All the work done so far is spoiled due to the useless design
 big dizin ap front or waterfol model ke peeche yahi mukhya vichaar hai - nirmaan ke prarambh main bitaayaa gaya samay yah sunishchit karata he ki aavashyaktaaen evam dizin bilkul sahi he or baad main isse adhik se adhik samay or prayaas bachegaa
 is prakaar, jo waterfol prakriya kaa anusaran karte hai, unki soch yahi he ki isse pehle ki vah kaarykram nirmaan ke agle charan main bade, vyakti ko yah sunishchit kar lenaa chahie ki prayek charan 100% purna or bilkul sahi he
 Program requirements must be set in stone before starting design; Program design must be completed before people start working on the implementation of the design, etc
 waterfol model ke liye ek or tark yah bhi he ki yah pralekhan ke saath-saath strot code par bhi bal detaa he
 With less design and documentation methods, if team members are left out, more and more knowledge is lost and the project can be difficult to emerge from
 ek puri tarah se kaam kar rahe dizin kaa dastauez maujuud hona chahie nai team ke sadasyon yaa bhi purnataya nai tiimon ko bhi dastavezon ko padhakar apane aap ko parichit karne main sakasham hona chahie
 In addition to the above, some also prefer the waterfall model because of its simplistic approach and argue that it is more disciplined
 waterfol pakshpaati jise araajaktaa ke rup main dekhte hai, uski apeksha, waterfol model ek sanrachit drushtikon pradaan karata he; model swayan asatat, aasaani se samajhane yogya or vyakhyamoolak charnon main ek rekha main vikaas karata he or is prakaar ise samajhane main aasaani hoti he; yah deveopment prakriya main aasaani se chihnit karne yogya milastons bhi prastut karata he
 This is probably because the waterfall model is used in many software engineering texts and courses as an early example of a development model
 yah tark diya jaataa he ki waterfol model or big dizin ap front saamanytah un software pariyojnaon ke liye anukool ho sakate hai jo sthaayee hote hai or jahaan yah sambhav hota he yaa is baat kii sambhaavna hoti he ki diziner system ke samasya ke kshetron kii puri bhavishyavaanee karne or karyanvayan shuru karne se pehle ek sateek dizin kaa nirmaan karne main sakasham honge
 The waterfall model also requires that the implementer follow a well-designed, accurately designed design and ensure that system integration is proceeding smoothly
 waterfol model ke sandarbh main kai log yah tark dete hai ki vyavhaar kii drushti se yah ek karaab vichaar he
 This is particularly due to their belief that they think that it is impossible for any non-trivial project to achieve the completion of a phase of a software product's lifecycle before moving on to the next steps and learning from them
 is
 udhaaharan ke liye, ho saktaa he ki clients is baat se acchhee tarah se avgat na ho ki kaam ke prototip kii samiksha karne or us par tipanni karne se pehle unhen kin-kin aavashyaktaaon kii aavashyaktaa he; ve apni aavashyaktaaon ko lagaataar badal sakate hai
 Designers and programmers may have little control over this
 dizin ko antim rup dene ke baad yadi clients apni aavashyaktaaon main badlaav karata he to nai aavashyaktaaon ko samyojit karne ke liye dizin ko avashya hi sanshodhit kiya janaa chahie
 This effectively means that most of the work time is invalidated which means that the cost is increased, especially if a large amount of the project's resources are already in the Big Design Up front Has been invested
 ho saktaa he ki dizinron ko ek acaryanvit software utpaada ke dizin kaa lekhan karne ke samay bhavishya main karyanvayan kii kathinaaiyon kii jaankaree na ho
 This means that in the implementation phase it can become clear that a particular area of program functionality is exceptionally difficult to implement
 yadi yahi maamla he to us dizin ko prayog karte rahane kii apeksha dizin ko sanshodhit karnaa behatar hota he jo galat purvanumaan par aadhaarit tha or jo nae khoje gaye samasya ke kshetron ke sandarbh main ab upyogi nahin he
 Even without such a change of specification during implementation, there is a possibility of either starting a new SW project from scratch, "on a green field", or continuing some already existing, "a brown field"
 waterfol paddati kaa prayog multah kisi duusare team ke satat vruddhi ke liye, pehle se maujuud SW ke liye bhi, kiya ja saktaa he
 When the analyst of the system fails to understand the customer's requirements correctly, the resulting effect of the following steps can still be tamed by this method and in this case as well as in practice it is a QA is a challenging task for the team
 "managing da deveopment of large software systams", pratham patr jisamen waterfol model kaa varnan he, main dow winston dablyoo royas ne bhi sarvasaamaanya rup ko "riski and invaits felyor" ke rup main varnan kiya he
 In Code Complete, Steve mcconnell refers to the design as a "wicked problem" - a problem whose requirements and limitations may not be fully known before completion
 iskaa nihitarth yahi he ki software deveopment ke ek charan ko purna karnaa asambhav he, is prakaar agle charan main jane ke liye waterfol model kaa prayog karnaa bhi asambhav he
 In "A Rational Design Process: How and Why to Fake It", David Parnes wrote: " ke kai vivaranon kaa pataa hamalogon ko tabhi chal paata hai jab humlog karyanvayan main pragati karte hai
 The things we learn invalidate our design and we must keep an eye on it
 " waterfol model ke peeche "meisur twis; cat vans" kaa vichaar bhi ho saktaa he or waterfol model ke vipakshi yah tark dete hai ki yah vichaar alag raah pakad letaa he jab aavashyaktaa main sanshodhano or swayan samasya ke sandarbh main nai prathitiyon ke kaaran maapi ja rahi samasya lagaataar badal rahi hoti he
 a solution may emerge in the form of some "investment of man-time" that aims to consolidate the SW back together for which some experienced developers are ordered to give time on refactoring
 ek or drushtikon, interphes ke saath praturupaktaa kaa lakshyikaran karke ek bhavishyavaanee dizin dwaara in aavashyaktaaon kii rokthaam karnaa he
 In response to perceived problems with pure waterfall models, several modified waterfall models have been presented
 ye model, shuddh waterfol model ke kuch yaa sabhi aalochanaon ko sambodhit kar sakate hai
 Steve mcconnell has included several different models in the "lifecycle Planning" chapter of his book, Rapid Development: Taming Wild Software Schedules
 jabaki sabhi software deveopment modelon main waterfol model kii kuch samanthaayen shaamil hongi or chunki sabhi software deveopment model, waterfol model ke antargat prayukt charnon main se kam se kam kuch charnon ko shaamil karegi, to yah anubhag, waterfol model ke un sabase kareebi charnon ke saath sambandhit hogi
 Models that apply further differences to the waterfall model and those models or fundamentally different models require general information in the process of software development
 saishimi model kii utpatti peter degres ne kii
 It is also sometimes referred to as "the waterfall model with overlapping phases" or "the waterfall model with feedback"
 chunki saishimi model ke charan ativyapee hote hai isliye samasya sthalon kii jaankaree un charnon ke dauraan kaary kar sakate hai jo aam taur par, shuddh waterfol model main, anya charnon se aage hote hai
 For example, since the design and implementation phases are overlapping in the Sashimi model, implementation problems can be detected during the design and implementation phase of the development process

 Scientists found that before the neural stem cells were dead, the host brain had induced a large number of stem cells to be stimulated, leading to an improvement in damage
 These findings answered key questions from the cell research stem community that were published in the leading journal Molecular Psychiatry published earlier this year
 Scientists are now developing procedures under which neural stem cells can be used as minimally invasively as possible through blood vessels, perhaps making this therapy practical and diagnostic
 Researchers are also developing methods for taking cells from the patient's own body, converting them into stem cells and then transplanting them back into the patient's blood through the bloodstream

 The alternative does not necessarily require the destruction of the fetus, such as destruction of umbilical cord blood, milk tooth stem cells, bone marrow stem cells or induction of pluripotent stem cells
 Cells derived from these alternative sources lack serious side effects globally in embryonic stem cell treatment, often resulting in malignant rejection by most examinees

 However, retrospective studies have shown that China used embryonic-derived brain tissue in humans suffering from spinal cord injury, but did not succeed as promising and described phenotypes and transplanted cells as olfactory anesthesia cells
 Has been done, the fate of all these cells could not be known
 Also, evidence of post-treatment mortality and a reduction in functional benefits emerged as a serious diagnostic error
 In addition, the extent of policy regulation on the use of stem cell therapy in China is unclear
