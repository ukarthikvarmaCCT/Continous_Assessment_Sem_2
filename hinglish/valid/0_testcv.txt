 Shami, who missed the World Cup due to injury in a match, returned against the West Indies and bowled from the same run up

 com / 7bscpndnkk — BCCI (@BCCI) January 11, 2018 Earlier in the day, Team India management conducted an optional practice session (optional practice session) a day after losing the first Test tour in Cape Town by 72 runs
 us abhyaas satr kii khaas baat yah rahi ki isamen wo khilaadi shaamil nahin hue, jo pehle test main khele the
 India will study in this way, how will India grow? 
 
 ji haa, ye sachai jaanakar aap bhi yah sochane par majaboor ho jaaenge ki agar aise hi padhegaa india-to kaise badhegaa india?khabar uttar pradesh se he, jahaan parishadiy yani sarkari primary or middle skulon ke master ji se sirf bacchon ko padhaane kaa hi kaam nahin liya jaataa, balki unke jimme itane alag-alag sarkari or bhi kaam thope die jate hai jisase unka zyaadaatar samay to in kaamon main hi biit jaataa he or bacchon kii padhai prabhavit hoti he
 In such a situation, if it is said that the education of the government schools of Uttar Pradesh is going on with God, then there will be nothing wrong
 purvi uttar pradesh main mughalsarai ke ek skool main ham pahunche to pataa chalaa ki yahaan kai teachers aae hi nahin kyonki unako matadaata punarreekshan ke kaam main laga diya gaya he or wo ghar ghar jaakar matadaata suchi kaa punarreekshan kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 You will be surprised to know that which government jobs are taken from the teachers who have been appointed to provide children
 janaganana, matganana or bal gananaa se lekar matadaata punarreekshan or samaajawaadee pension kii feeding ke saath poshan mishan tak main shikshakon ko laga diya jaataa he
 Actually, there are elections to the Legislative Assembly and Municipal bodies in UP and in such a situation the challenge before the government is to check and correct the voter list
 isko lekar vartmaan samay main puure uttar pradesh main jor-shor se matadaata punarreekshan kaa kaam chal rahaa he or is kaam main sabhi jilon main adhyapakon ko bhi laga diya gaya he
 In such a situation, a large part of the teachers are engaged in the revision of the voter list
 jaahir si baat he kii iske chalate baccho kii padhai baadhit hogi
 Every school has alam that there are only few teachers left who are fulfilling the quorum of teaching children in some way
 DM bole- skool time ke baad ye kaam karen teacherschandauli ke dm kumaar prashanth ne kaha ki sabase pehle to hamaari praathamikta yahi thi ki adhyapakon ko is kaam main na lagaaya jaae
 People from other departments should be employed, but even then the number of blos was not being fulfilled
 vahaan par hamane adhyapakon ko lagaaya he or unako spasht nirdesh die gaye hai ki jo skool time main pathan pathan kaa kaam karen or uske baad ek se 5-6 tak ye apana bilon kaa kaam karen
 So that the work of Pathan reading is not affected and BLO work also goes on smoothly

 When the show failed to bring a high TRP in the first two weeks, an internal meeting was held between the channel and the production house to decide further
 haalanki, ham kisi bhi badlaav se anjaan the
 One day when i reached the set, it was revealed that Vikas was not part of the show and it was a big shock for me
 main iske liye taiyaar nahin thi
 So, i went to ask my creative producers about my track and they told me according to the creative call, the show will now focus on the story of Lord Vishnu
 isliye, mujhe spashtataa mil gai thi ki kya hone vaala he
 Therefore, i left the show

 arthvyavastha par lagaataar bade-bade daawey kar rahi centre kii narendra modi sarkaar kii kalai jidipi ke aankadon ne puri tarah se kholkar rakh di he
 With the introduction of demonetisation and GST, there has been a big dive in the GDP of the country, then the government says that demonetisation has nothing to do with it
 agar thodaa peeche jaakar dekhen, to notebandi lagu hone ke baad jab sansad main is par bahes ho rahi thi tab purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne sarkaar par isko lekar chetaya tha
 Manmohan's warning seems to be proving true
 
 What did Manmohan say in Rajya Sabha? During the discussion on demonetisation, in November 2016, Manmohan Singh in Rajya Sabha had clearly said that demonetisation is a threat to Indian economy
 isse arthvyavastha kamjor ho sakati he, vahiin jidipi main 2 fisadi kii giravat aa sakati he
 The former PM had said directly that i want to ask PM Modi to name a country where people have deposited their money in the bank but they cannot withdraw it
 roj badalte niyam aapaki vifaltaa!manmohan singh ne rajyasabha main kaha tha ki karency system main logon kaa bharosa kam hua he, kisaanon or chote udyogpatiyon ko bhi bada nuksaan hua he
 The government is making new rules every day, which clearly shows that the PMO failed to implement this decision
 piem ne iske liye 50 din maange hai, lekin garib vyakti ke liye 50 din dard jhelana aasaan nahin he
 Demonetisation: Manmohan continued to speak in Rajya Sabha, PM Modi kept listening, this was the talk of Manmohan Singh, 12 big wars! During the quarter ending in June of the current financial year, the growth rate of GDP of the country has been recorded
 jidipi kaa aankada girakar 5
 Has come at 7 percent
 vitt varsh 2016-17 kii pehali timahi ke dauraan jidipi kii raftaar 7
 Was 9 percent
 yani notebandi ke baad se lagaataar jidipi main giravat ai he
 GDP 7 in a year
 9 se girakar 5
 Has reached 7 percent
 in 4 point main samajhie GDP main ai giravat kaa notebandi conection!modi ne diya tha ye javabpiem modi ne raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa ke dauraan manmohan singh ke sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi diya tha
 Modi said while attacking that Manmohan Singh ji is former PM, he is respected
 pichley 30-35 saal se bharat ke aarthik faislon ke saath unka sidhaa sambandh rahaa he
 Half of the time they were the only ones, no one would have lived in this country
 lekin ham rajaneta manmohan singh se sikh sakate hai
 Manmohan was never stained
 bathroom main renkot pahan kar nahaana ye kala manmohan ji ke alaava koi nahin jaanata
 Explain that the Central Government has implemented the GST from July 1 by scrapping the old tax structure
 aarthik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki nae kar dhaanche or jiesti ke prabhaavon kii vajah se hi jidipi main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he
 Bathing in a raincoat in the bathroom, someone should learn from Manmohan: Modi soshal media par aapattijanak post karne par iti act ke tahat police karwai ke maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe supreme court ne buudhvaar ko centre sarkaar par kai sawaal daage
 The court said that if the poster cannot be traced then what is the need of framing the rules
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne poocha tha ki kya aapattijanak post karne vaale kii pahchaan ho sakati he, or centre sarkaar kii or se pesh hue computer immergency rispons team ke diji gulshan raay ne court ko bataaya tha ki nai technology main yah mushkil he, kyonki iske liye chhipe hue sarvaron kaa istemaal hota he or zyaadaatar sarwar videsh main hote hai, so, aise main yah to pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kis computer se post kiya gaya he, lekin post karne vaale kii pahchaan nahin kii ja sakati
 He also said that the countries of Europe do not provide information in this matter, which increases the difficulties, although the government is talking to these countries to share the information
 court ke saamne computer par post karke demo dikhaane kii baat bhi kahi gai
 After hearing the matter, the bench of the Supreme Court expressed concern that if the poster cannot be reached, then what is the benefit of the practice of framing new rules in this matter
 is maamle main court agle hafte bhi sunwaayee jari rakhega
 The Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP), headed by former Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel, on Saturday released its list of 63 candidates for the first round of Gujarat assembly elections

 dilli ko rajya to nahin mila magar koun raaj karegaa uskaa hisaab aaj saaf ho gaya
 You will find skeletons of all the arguments to justify the game, which has been running for two years with the lieutenant governor not to let the Delhi government run
 supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ke faisle se bhale kuch na badale aisa kehane vaale vahi kah sakate hai, jinhen ab bhi bharosa he ki kabhi vidhayakon kii sadsyta khatm karne kii chaal se to kabhi governor ke bahaane dilli main khel ab bhi khelaa jayega
 Yet for a long time, the fog of Delhi's constitutional sky has been lifted
 ab dilli kaa vakt is sawaal ko lekar barbaad nahin hoga ki mukhyamantri sarkaar chalaayenge yaa leftinent governor
 For the last two years, it seems that the lieutenant governor is the government and the elected chief minister is just a complainant in front of his government
 pehle yahi samajhaayaa jaataa rahaa ki mukhyamantri ko alji ke hisaab se kaam karnaa hoga, magar paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne saaf-saaf kah diya he ki chuni hui sarkaar loktantr main ahm he isliye, mantriparishad ke paas faisle lene kaa adhikaar he
 a division bench of Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, Justice AK Sikri, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan ruled by majority that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is the Administrator and not the Governor
 court ne kaha, uparajyapal ke paas khud faisale lene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The Lt
 Governor does not have independent authority to administer
 uparajyapal mantrimandal ke faisle lene kii prakriya main baadha nahin daal sakate
 Lt
 Governors cannot usurp powers not given to them in the Constitution
 har maamle main uparajyapal kii sahmati zaruri nahin he
 The state should have the freedom to work without any interference
 uparajyapal ko mantriparishad ke saath sadbhaavnapurna tareeke se kaam karnaa chahie
 Resolve the difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Cabinet by mutual discussion
 uparajyapal mecanical tareeke se saare maamle raashtrapati ko nahin bhejenge
 Lieutenant governors cannot stop decisions in a mechanized manner
 sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ko sammaan diya janaa chahie
 After this decision, it should be clear in the mind of the Lieutenant Governor that he is the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi but Delhi is not his
 janata ne unhen nahin chunaa he, balki unka chunaav kaise hua he, ye behatar vahi jaanate hai
 Through two Lieutenant Governors, the elected government of Delhi has played the game of forming a government that works under the Governor
 ummid he khilaadi ab kuch doosraa khel khelenge, ye vaala band kar denge
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the people of Delhi did not choose the mlas while voting at India Gate that the political party will vote and the Lt
 Governor will rule
 supreme court ne aaj kaha ki bhoomi, police or kanoon vyavastha par kend sarkaar kaa adhikaar he
 Barring these matters, the Lieutenant Governor is obliged to accept the opinion of the Delhi Government
 uski madad lene ke liye baadhya hai
 The Delhi government should be allowed to enact and administer laws in other matters
 samvidhan kii kitaab palatie, supreme court ne vahi kaha jo samvidhan main shabdash kaha gaya he
 239A clearly states that the Lieutenant Governor shall have a Council of Ministers to assist and advise in the exercise of its functions in respect of those matters in respect of which the Legislative Assembly has the power to legislate, which shall be 10 percent of the total strength of the Assembly
 Consists of not more members
 jiskaa pradhan mukhyamantri hoga
 The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly
 pataa nahin leftinent governor ne samvidhan kii koun si kitaab pard lee thi, jisamen likhaa tha ki pradhan mukhyamantri uparajyapal hoga
 Today the Supreme Court has held the Constitution Bench holding the correct book and correct interpretation of the Constitution
 filon ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 Recently, the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister had staged a sit-in in the LG office, the Lt
 Governor did not even come
 is faisle main likhaa he ki kisi mudde par matbhed hone par uparajyapal apane paas file nahin rakh sakate the, unhen raashtrapati ke paas bhejnaa hoga or ye matbhed chote mote mudde par nahin hone chahie
 One place in the judgment clearly states that the Executive Governor has enough power over the executive decision taken by the Council of Ministers to send it to the President for consideration in case of disagreement, but the Constitutional Plan does not say that the Council of Ministers should make its decisions
 For this the consent of the Lt
 Governor has to be obtained
 vighansabha chune hue pratinidhiyon ke mat kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, unke mat or faisle kaa har haal main sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 All decisions and proposals should be communicated to the Lieutenant Governor, so that the dialogue remains, but this communication does not mean that the Lieutenant Governor has to be approved
 ek hi samvidhan he
 The things written in it are also permanently printed
 iske baad bhi do saal pehle agast 2016 main dilli hoicourt kii vyakhya or 2018 main supreme court kii vyakhya main zamin aasmaan kaa antar he
 How can it be so that there can be such a difference in the understanding of the Constitution
 4 agast 2016 ke apane faisle main justise jayant nath ne likhaa he ki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dilli ke uparajyapal mantriparishad kii sahaayta or salaah maanane ke liye baadhya hai, un maamalon main jinamein vidhansabha ko 239 e ke upbandh (3)(a) ke tahat kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hasil he
 It has no merit and cannot be accepted
 main aapako us vakt ke akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan bhi dikhaanaa chahta hum taaki aap darshak buniyadi rup se yah baat samaj len ki samvidhan kii vyakhya jajon kii apni-apni samaj par bhi nirbhar karti he
 Otherwise how can it be that the constitution bench of the Supreme Court also believes that Delhi is the Union Territory, the High Court also believes that Delhi is the Union Territory
 magar hoicourt kahata he ki alji bos hai, supreme court kahata he ki mukhyamantri bos hai
 The comments in sari hedline ko aap dekhie yaad kiijie un dinon ko jab tivi kii bahes main yah dikhaaya gaya or akhabaaron main yah chapa ki dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar kaa mukhiya koi haisiyat hi nahin rakhata he
 It has been written in the High Court's decision that in the case of services, the Lieutenant Governor can act like the Central Government
 supreme court ke faisle main kaha jaataa he ki jin teen chaar maamalon main dilli vidhansabha kaa adhikaar nahin banataa he, uske alaava leftinent governor kaa koi dakhal nahin banataa he
 They are administrators, not governors
 dilli ko rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa he, ye faisla pehle kii samvidhan peeth ne bhi diya he or is samvidhan peeth ne bhi diya, magar aaj ke faisle ke baad se uparajyapal kii seemaa saaf ho gai he
 The Chief Minister has got the right to be the Chief Minister
 jab-jab arvind kejariwal ne is dakhlandaazi kaa virodh hua, ve is propeganda ke shikaar hue ki dilli kaa kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 Making excuses
 ab saaf ho gaya ki kaam jise karnaa tha use nahin karne diya ja rahaa tha or jise nahin karnaa wo karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha yaa kaam hi nahin hone de rahaa tha

 ab saaf ho gaya ki kaam jise karnaa tha use nahin karne diya ja rahaa tha or jise nahin karnaa wo karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha yaa kaam hi nahin hone de rahaa tha
 The court said, the Lieutenant Governor does not have the authority to take his own decision
 uparajyapal ke paas prashasan kaa swatantra adhikaar nahin he
 The Lt
 Governor cannot obstruct the decision-making process of the Cabinet
 uparajyapal un shaktiyon ko nahin hadap sakate jo samvidhan main unhen nahin di gai he
 Lt
 Governor's consent is not necessary in every case
 rajya ko bina kisi dakhal ke kaam karne kii azaadi ho
 The Lieutenant Governor should work in a good manner with the Council of Ministers
 uparajyapal or cabinet ke bich raay ke antar ko aapasi charchaa se sulajhaayen
 The Lieutenant Governor will not send all matters to the President in a mechanical way
 uparajyapal masini tareeke se faislon ko nahin roak sakate hai
 Government representatives should be respected
 is faisle ke baad uparajyapal ke dimaag main yah baat saaf ho jaani chahie ki ve dilli ke uparajyapal to hai magar dilli unki nahin hai
 The public has not elected him, rather he knows better how he was elected
 do-do uparajyapalon ke zarie dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ko garvanar ke maatahat kaam karne vaali sarkaar banane kaa khel khelaa gaya he
 Hopefully players will play some other game now, this one will stop
 supreme court ke faisle se saaf hota he ki dilli kii janata ne india get par tafarih karte hue vidhayakon ko nahin chunaa tha ki vot denge raajnneetik dal ko or raaj karenge uparajyapal
 The Supreme Court today said that the central government has authority over land, police and law and order
 in maamalon ko chhodkar leftinent governor ko dilli sarkaar kii raay maanane ke liye baadhya hai
 Are obliged to seek his help
 dilli sarkaar ko anya maamalon main kanoon banane or prashasan karne kii ijazat di jaani chahie
 Flip the book of the constitution, the Supreme Court said what is said in the Constitution literally
 239 e main saaf saaf likhaa he ki uparajyapal ko un vishyon ke sambandh main jinaki babat vidhansabha ko vidhi banane kii shakti he, apane krityon kaa prayog karne main sahaayta or salaah dene ke liye ek mantriparishad hogi jo vidhansabha kii kul sadsy sankhya ke 10 pratishat se andhik sadasyon se milakar banegi
 Whose chief will be the chief minister
 mantriparishad vidhansabha ke prati samuhik rup se uttaradaayi hogi
 i do not know which book of the Constitution the lieutenant governor had read in which it was written that the Chief Chief Minister would be the Lieutenant Governor
 aaj supreme court ne samvidhan peeth ne samvidhan kii sahi kitaab or sahi vyakhya pakadaa di he
 There was a lot of controversy about the files
 haal hi main alji ke daftar main mukhyamantri, upmukhyamantri ne dharna diya tha, uparajyapal milane tak nahin aae
 It has been written in the judgment that in case of differences on any issue, the Lieutenant Governor could not keep the file with him, he would have to send it to the President and these differences should not be on minor issues
 faisle main ek jagah saaf-saaf likhaa he ki mantriparishad dwaara liye gaye kaaryakari faisle par up rajyapal ko paryaapt shakti he ki asahmati kii sthiti main raashtrapati ke paas vichaar ke liye bhej den, lekin sanvaidhanik yojana yah kabhi nahin kahati he ki mantriparishad ko apane faisle ke liye uparajyapal kii sahmati leni hogi
 The Vidhan Sabha represents the vote of the elected representatives, their vote and judgment should be respected at all times
 up rajyapal ko sabhi faisle or prastaavon kii soochna di jaani chahie, taaki samvaad bana rahe, lekin is samvaad kaa yah matlab nahin he ki uparajyapal kii manzuri leni he
 There is only one constitution
 usamen likhi hui baaten bhi sthaayee rup se chhapi hai
 Even after this, there is a difference of ground between the interpretation of the Delhi High Court in August 2016 and the interpretation of the Supreme Court in 2018 two years ago
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki samvidhan kii samaj main itnaa antar aa saktaa he
 In his judgment dated 4 August 2016, Justice Jayant Nath has written that the Delhi Government maintains that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is obliged to accept the assistance and advice of the Council of Ministers, in those cases in which the Legislative Assembly provides (3) (a) of 239A Has the right to make laws under isamen koi dam nahin he or sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 i also want to show you the headlines of the newspapers of that time so that you, the audience, basically understand that the interpretation of the constitution also depends on the judges' own understanding
 varanaa yah kaise ho saktaa he ki supreme court kii samvidhan peeth bhi maanati he ki dilli union terrytory he, hoicourt bhi maanata he ki dilli union territary he
 But the High Court says that LG is the boss, the Supreme Court says that the Chief Minister is the boss
 tippaniyan Look at all these headlines, remember those days when it was shown in the TV debate and it was published in the newspapers that the head of the elected government of Delhi does not have any status
 hoicourt ke faisle main likhaa he ki services ke maamle main leftinent governor kend sarkaar kii tarah act kar sakate hai
 It is said in the Supreme Court's decision that apart from the three four cases in which Delhi Legislative Assembly does not have the authority, there is no interference from the Lieutenant Governor
 ve prashaasak hai, rajyapal nahi hai
 Delhi cannot be given the status of state, this decision has been given by the earlier constitution bench and also by this constitution bench, but after today's decision, the boundary of the Lieutenant Governor has been cleared
 mukhyamantri ko mukhyamantri hone kaa adhikaar mila he
 When Arvind Kejriwal protested against this interference, he succumbed to the propaganda that he was not working in Delhi
 bahaane bana rahe hai
 Now it became clear that the work that was to be done was not being allowed to be done, and what it was not to do, it was trying to do or the work was not allowed to happen
 is faisle ke baad uparajyapal ke dimaag main yah baat saaf ho jaani chahie ki ve dilli ke uparajyapal to hai magar dilli unki nahin hai
 The public has not elected him, rather he knows better how he was elected
 do-do uparajyapalon ke zarie dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ko garvanar ke maatahat kaam karne vaali sarkaar banane kaa khel khelaa gaya he
 Hopefully players will play some other game now, this one will stop
 supreme court ke faisle se saaf hota he ki dilli kii janata ne india get par tafarih karte hue vidhayakon ko nahin chunaa tha ki vot denge raajnneetik dal ko or raaj karenge uparajyapal
 The Supreme Court today said that the central government has authority over land, police and law and order
 in maamalon ko chhodkar leftinent governor ko dilli sarkaar kii raay maanane ke liye baadhya hai
 Are obliged to seek his help
 dilli sarkaar ko anya maamalon main kanoon banane or prashasan karne kii ijazat di jaani chahie
 Flip the book of the constitution, the Supreme Court said what is said in the Constitution literally
 239 e main saaf saaf likhaa he ki uparajyapal ko un vishyon ke sambandh main jinaki babat vidhansabha ko vidhi banane kii shakti he, apane krityon kaa prayog karne main sahaayta or salaah dene ke liye ek mantriparishad hogi jo vidhansabha kii kul sadsy sankhya ke 10 pratishat se andhik sadasyon se milakar banegi
 Whose chief will be the chief minister
 mantriparishad vidhansabha ke prati samuhik rup se uttaradaayi hogi
 i do not know which book of the Constitution the lieutenant governor had read in which it was written that the Chief Chief Minister would be the Lieutenant Governor
 aaj supreme court ne samvidhan peeth ne samvidhan kii sahi kitaab or sahi vyakhya pakadaa di he
 There was a lot of controversy about the files
 haal hi main alji ke daftar main mukhyamantri, upmukhyamantri ne dharna diya tha, uparajyapal milane tak nahin aae
 It has been written in the judgment that in case of differences on any issue, the Lieutenant Governor could not keep the file with him, he would have to send it to the President and these differences should not be on minor issues
 faisle main ek jagah saaf-saaf likhaa he ki mantriparishad dwaara liye gaye kaaryakari faisle par up rajyapal ko paryaapt shakti he ki asahmati kii sthiti main raashtrapati ke paas vichaar ke liye bhej den, lekin sanvaidhanik yojana yah kabhi nahin kahati he ki mantriparishad ko apane faisle ke liye uparajyapal kii sahmati leni hogi
 The Vidhan Sabha represents the vote of the elected representatives, their vote and judgment should be respected at all times
 up rajyapal ko sabhi faisle or prastaavon kii soochna di jaani chahie, taaki samvaad bana rahe, lekin is samvaad kaa yah matlab nahin he ki uparajyapal kii manzuri leni he
 There is only one constitution
 usamen likhi hui baaten bhi sthaayee rup se chhapi hai
 Even after this, there is a difference of ground between the interpretation of the Delhi High Court in August 2016 and the interpretation of the Supreme Court in 2018 two years ago

 Now it became clear that the work that was to be done was not being allowed to be done, and what it was not to do, it was trying to do or the work was not allowed to happen
 supreme court ne aaj kaha ki bhoomi, police or kanoon vyavastha par kend sarkaar kaa adhikaar he
 Barring these matters, the Lieutenant Governor is obliged to accept the opinion of the Delhi Government
 uski madad lene ke liye baadhya hai
 The Delhi government should be allowed to enact and administer laws in other matters
 samvidhan kii kitaab palatie, supreme court ne vahi kaha jo samvidhan main shabdash kaha gaya he
 239A clearly states that the Lieutenant Governor shall have a Council of Ministers to assist and advise in the exercise of its functions in respect of those matters in respect of which the Legislative Assembly has the power to legislate, which shall be 10 percent of the total strength of the Assembly
 Consists of not more members
 jiskaa pradhan mukhyamantri hoga
 The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly
 pataa nahin leftinent governor ne samvidhan kii koun si kitaab pard lee thi, jisamen likhaa tha ki pradhan mukhyamantri uparajyapal hoga
 Today the Supreme Court has held the Constitution Bench holding the correct book and correct interpretation of the Constitution
 filon ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 Recently, the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister had staged a sit-in in the LG office, the Lt
 Governor did not even come
 is faisle main likhaa he ki kisi mudde par matbhed hone par uparajyapal apane paas file nahin rakh sakate the, unhen raashtrapati ke paas bhejnaa hoga or ye matbhed chote mote mudde par nahin hone chahie
 One place in the judgment clearly states that the Executive Governor has enough power over the executive decision taken by the Council of Ministers to send it to the President for consideration in case of disagreement, but the Constitutional Plan does not say that the Council of Ministers should make its decisions
 For this the consent of the Lt
 Governor has to be obtained
 vighansabha chune hue pratinidhiyon ke mat kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, unke mat or faisle kaa har haal main sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 All decisions and proposals should be communicated to the Lieutenant Governor, so that the dialogue remains, but this communication does not mean that the Lieutenant Governor has to be approved
 ek hi samvidhan he
 The things written in it are also permanently printed
 iske baad bhi do saal pehle agast 2016 main dilli hoicourt kii vyakhya or 2018 main supreme court kii vyakhya main zamin aasmaan kaa antar he
 How can it be so that there can be such a difference in the understanding of the Constitution
 4 agast 2016 ke apane faisle main justise jayant nath ne likhaa he ki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dilli ke uparajyapal mantriparishad kii sahaayta or salaah maanane ke liye baadhya hai, un maamalon main jinamein vidhansabha ko 239 e ke upbandh (3)(a) ke tahat kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hasil he
 It has no merit and cannot be accepted
 main aapako us vakt ke akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan bhi dikhaanaa chahta hum taaki aap darshak buniyadi rup se yah baat samaj len ki samvidhan kii vyakhya jajon kii apni-apni samaj par bhi nirbhar karti he
 Otherwise how can it be that the constitution bench of the Supreme Court also believes that Delhi is the Union Territory, the High Court also believes that Delhi is the Union Territory
 magar hoicourt kahata he ki alji bos hai, supreme court kahata he ki mukhyamantri bos hai
 The comments in sari hedline ko aap dekhie yaad kiijie un dinon ko jab tivi kii bahes main yah dikhaaya gaya or akhabaaron main yah chapa ki dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar kaa mukhiya koi haisiyat hi nahin rakhata he
 It has been written in the High Court's decision that in the case of services, the Lieutenant Governor can act like the Central Government
 supreme court ke faisle main kaha jaataa he ki jin teen chaar maamalon main dilli vidhansabha kaa adhikaar nahin banataa he, uske alaava leftinent governor kaa koi dakhal nahin banataa he
 They are administrators, not governors
 dilli ko rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa he, ye faisla pehle kii samvidhan peeth ne bhi diya he or is samvidhan peeth ne bhi diya, magar aaj ke faisle ke baad se uparajyapal kii seemaa saaf ho gai he
 The Chief Minister has got the right to be the Chief Minister
 jab-jab arvind kejariwal ne is dakhlandaazi kaa virodh hua, ve is propeganda ke shikaar hue ki dilli kaa kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 Making excuses
 ab saaf ho gaya ki kaam jise karnaa tha use nahin karne diya ja rahaa tha or jise nahin karnaa wo karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha yaa kaam hi nahin hone de rahaa tha
 i do not know which book of the Constitution the lieutenant governor had read in which it was written that the Chief Chief Minister would be the Lieutenant Governor

 upi main shahjahanpur ke patrkaar jagendra singh kii maut ke maamle main nayaa twist aa gaya he
 Jagendra Singh's son Rahul Singh has revealed that his father committed suicide by setting himself on fire
 parivaar ne sibiai jaanch kii yachika bhi waapas le lee he
 UP minister Ramamurthy Singh Verma was accused in this case
 nai jaankaree ke mutabik,jagendra sinhane 1 june, 2015 ko police giraftaar se bachane ke liye khud par petrol chhidakar aag laga lee thi
 He then accused several people, including the minister and Kotwal, of burning him to death
 jagendra ke parivaar ne shuru main dharna-pradarshan kiya tha or pachaas lakh muaavje or naukari kii maang kii thi, jis par pradesh sarkaar ne parivaar ko 30 lakh kaa muaavja diya tha
 Both sons of Jagendra were also assured of jobs

 Jagendra's son also says that he had told the family about spraying petrol on himself before he died
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki agar parivaar ko aatmahatya kii baat pataa thi, to phir yah baat chhupaai kyon gai? baharhaal, jagendra singh ke parivaar ne sibiai jaanch kii maang kii apni yachika bhi waapas le lee he

 isaki rajdhani guwahati ke pashchim main nilanjan kii paharipoon par bana hua ek vikhyath mandir he—kamakhya mandir
 The adorable idol installed in the sanctum sanctorum of this temple of Kamakhya Devi is not of a powerful god, but of a woman's vagina
 is mandir main har saal barish ke mausam main ek charadini mela lagata he—ambubachi mela
 It is said that during this time Goddess Kamakhya is menstruating
 chaar dinon kaa yah mela unke masik dharm kaa utsav manaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Hearing this, it is a matter of pride to be a woman in this country
 lekin jaraa thahrie
 The matter is not yet complete
 chaar dinon tak stri ke sharir se har maheene nikalne vaale rakt kaa utsav manaane vaale is vishwa vikhyath mandir kaa ek sach or bhi he—yahaan periods ke dauraan mahilaon ko pravesh karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 Yes, in the temple where there is a statue of the vagina, where a fair is held when the goddess is menstruating, the entry of a menstruating woman is prohibited
 lekin yah parampara to sadiyon se chali aa rahi he? achaanak is kahani ko yun dohraye jane kii kuch khaas vajah? vajah he, kyonki achaanak hi aisi paramparaon se lekar dharmasthalon main mahilaon ke pravesh kaa mudda bahason or vivaadon kii mukhyadhara main aa gaya he or yah tab hua, jab aise hi ek pratibandh ke khilaaf 26 janvari ko achaanak maharashtra ke ek sudur gaanv main badi sankhya main mahilaayein sadakon par utar ain
 Shani Shingnapur is a small village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, which is in news these days
 itihaas kii kitaaben is gaanv ke bare main anuthi jaankariyon se bhari padi hai
 It is said that there has never been a single incident of theft, rioting, murder or rape in this village in the last 400 years
 yahaan kisi ghar ke daravaaje par aapako taala nahin milegaa
 Doors and windows remain open
 koi vruddh biimaar nahin padataa
 Everyone is healthy, happy
 raat main yahaan koi pret nahin ghumaa karte
 All people are happy with their condition
 bas kuch puraane pipal ke ped hai, jinhen log har shanivaar upwas ke dauraan shraddha se chhu liya karte hai
 how so? Because a miraculous black stone is stationed in the defense of this mysterious village
 ye shani dev hai
 There is no shadow of evil on this village because it is blessed by Lord Shani himself, who sits in the form of a huge stone of five and a half feet in the Muktakash temple
 log kehete hai, unki visfaarit ankhon se bachakar rahanaa varanaa saadhe saati lag jaaegi
 Far from the shadow of evil, what happened in this village on January 26 was nothing short of evil for Shani Shingnapur's priests, religious leaders, and many self-styled contractors of religion
 ganatantr diwas ke din samooche desh kii nazren achaanak tivi par gadi rah gayi, jab unhone dekha ki kareeb dedh hajaar mahilaayein shani mandir kii ore paidal chali ja rahi hai
 The crowd included social workers, housewives and girls
 in mahilaon kii maang bahut maamuli si thi—''unhen bhi mandir ke garbhagrih ke bheetar pravesh karne or puja karne kii ijaajat di jaae
 "traditionally, the sanctum sanctorum of this temple is prohibited for women
 aisa mana jaataa he ki striyon ke kareeb aane par bhagwaan 'hanikaarak tarangen' chhodie lagate hai
 Women have been barred from entering the temple for hundreds of years
 mahilaon ne bhi hameshaa naa-nukur kiye bagaiyr is alikhit niyam kaa paalan kiya or is par kabhi sawaal nahin kiya
 And something happened that day that suddenly this issue became the biggest question in the debates and newspaper articles of TV channels
 jaani-maani vakil vrinda grover puuchhati hai, ''hamaara samvidhan mahilaon ko har maamle main barabari kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Then why this discrimination in temples? ”A large section of the society stood with those women
 unhone ekajute hokar kaha, ''yah loktantr ke liye kaala din he
 "but a much larger group was still singing songs of tradition and culture
" dekhte-hi-dekhte shinganapur main is puri ghatana ne aakraamak rup le liya
 Police were deployed to protect the temple
 mahilaon or police ke bich jhadap bhi hui
 Controversy reached such that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also had to intervene to pacify it
 sharad pavaar or baba ramdev bhi mahilaon ke paksh main khadey ho gaye, lekin mandir mahilaon kii is maang kii nai-nai kaat khojane main jute gaya
 And in the twenty-first century, moving towards science and modernity, once again the question was posed in front of this country: "men and women are equal, their human rights are equal, the law and the constitution of this country are equal
" 'is this country still fully prepared to accept this simple, basic thing? Are we still not facing a constitutional crisis as a democracy? The constitution guarantees equality and religion refuses to obey it? Where are the roots of this contradiction and where is the solution? Religion vs constitutionalism and the pair of constitution are very mismatched
 donon kii aapas main banati nahin
 Both opponents talk
 lekin donon kaa astitv is baat main he ki stri kii deh or youniktaa, donon ke liye vaicharik dangal or faislon kaa akhaada he
 The two often clash over the question of the female body
 dharmik sanghathan striyon kii har cheez par nigaraanee rakhana chaahate hai
 They exaggerate what women should wear and what they should not wear, who to talk to or how to spend free time and with whom
 duusari ore kanoonee tantra ghar ke bheetar ghuskar parivaar, sambandh or saahchary kii sharten tay karne lagata he
 This struggle over the right of women to worship God and the controversy arises around this misleading idea of what is pure and what is not

 '' haalanki ve kehete hai ki hindu dharm bhi vakt ke saath lagaataar badalata rahaa he
 But Nivedita Menon, professor of history at JNU, asks, "but has religion changed with equal generosity in the case of women?" The answer is no
 '' ve kahati hai, ''sirf mandiron main hi kyon, kya ghar ke bheetar bhi rajaswala stri utani hi apavitra nahin maani jaati
 Does he have the right to worship or even touch a religious book during this time even inside the house? ”religion treats women everywhere discriminatory and considers them to be second-rate

 The Indian Young Lawyers Association (IYLA), a group of women lawyers, filed the suit against the temple in Kerala
 haalanki adaalat ne ab tak is par koi faisla nahin diya he, lekin nyaayadhishon ne spasht rup se is vivaadaaspad parampara kaa pratwaad kar diya, jab unhone kaha ki ''sirf dharm ke aadhaar par mandir mahilaon ke pravesh ko varjit nahin kar saktaa, jab tak ki aapke paas iske liye koi sanvaidhanik adhikaar na hon
 "at the center of this war involving the entry of women into the religious places is the Supreme Court and the Constitution
" supreme court ne zyada mukhar na hote hue bhi yah spasht tippanee to kar hi di he ki samvidhan main aisa koi bhedbhaav nahin he
 However, the decision on Sabarimala is still awaited

 In a similar case filed for the entry of women into Mumbai's Haji Ali Dargah, the Bombay High Court on 18 January had said, "before passing judgment on the petition of the Indian Muslim Women's Movement, the Supreme Court verdict in the Sabarimala case Will wait for '' is andolan ne mumbai kii haji ali dargah main 2011 main mahilaon ke pravesh ko lekar lagaae gaye pratibandh ko chunauti di thi

 "how will social change come? The law is doing its job
" in donon mukademon main court kaa faisla aage kii disha tay karegaa
 But there is another question which sociologist Ashish Nandi asks, "can democratic rights be achieved only through law and judiciary or does it require any socio-cultural change?" Socio-cultural change began when some young girls ran a Happy to Bleed campaign on social media to protest against the Sabarimala temple decision
 is saal november main travnakor devashvam board ke adhyaksh prayaar gopalkrishnan ne kaha ki sabarimala mandir main mahilaon kii shuddhta kii jaanch karne ke liye mashin lagaai jaaegi

 "religion or male power? Actually, this issue is not just about religion and law
 samaajavigyaani or manovishleshak sudhir kakkad poochhate hai, ''kya dharm pitrusatta ko hi majboot karne vaali sanstha nahin he? dharmik sansthaaon main mahilaon kii kitni hissedari he? kya dharm isi vichaar ko madad nahin karata ki purush stri se shreshth he
