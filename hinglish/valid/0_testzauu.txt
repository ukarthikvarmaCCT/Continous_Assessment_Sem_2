 Phillips Curve In economics, the Phillips curve is an historical inverse relationship between the same rate of unemployment and inflation rates of the economy in an economy
 kami berogari, arthvyavastha main mudrasphiti kii ucch dar ke saath sambandh sthapit karegaa
 While there is a short run between unemployment and inflation, in 1968, the Milton Friedman curve sang only in the short term
 lambey samay main dekha he or nahin kiya gaya he lambey samay main yahi mudrasphiti nitiyon berogari main kami nahin hogi
 Friedman then correctly predicted that, in the following years, after 1968, both inflation and unemployment would increase
 lambey samay se chalaane philips vakr ab kam se khadi rekha ke rup main swaabhaavik rup se dekha jaataa he mudrasphiti kii dar berogari par koi prabhaav nahin he jahaan berogari kii dar tadnusaar, philips vakr ab paise kii aapurti ke upaay ke veg par aadhaarit mudrasphiti kii adhik sateek bhavishyavaktaaon dwaara berogari dar ke saath, bahut saadhaaran rup main dekha jaataa he
 Such as m z m velocity, which is affected by unemployment in the short term, but not for long
 itihasberogari ke khilaaf mazdooree ke parivartan kii dar, united kingdom 1913-1948 se philips William Phillips, a New Zealand-born economist, wrote the title of the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change in money wage rates in the United Kingdom 1861–1957, which was published in a paper in 1958 in the quarterly journal Arthika
 philips kii jaanch kii avadhi main british arthvyavastha main manaaya paisa vetan or berogari parivartan ke bich ek ulataa rishta he kaise kaagaj se varnan he
 There were similar patterns found in other countries and in 1960 Paul Samuelson and Robert Solo 'phillips took the job and clarified the link between inflation and unemployment: inflation was high when unemployment was low, and vice versa
 1920 ke dashak main ek america arthshaastri irving fisher philips vakr sambandhon ke is tarah kaa ullekh kiya
 However, Phillips' original curve described the behavior of money wages

 This is why there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment
 This results from a long time

 Any condition that would fit the data, but there are three rough aggregates — 1955–1971, 1974–1984, and 1985–1992 — each of which shows a generally downward slope, but a change With three abruptly occurring on three very different levels

 But still taking into account inflation expectations today, the modified form of the Phillips curve remains dominant

 Besides inflation expectations, Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman argued that when it changes upwards since the "low-run Phillips curve", it is also called the "expectations-augmented Phillips curve"

 However, this long-run "neutrality" of monetary policy does not allow for the monetary authority's ability to reduce unemployment by short-term fluctuations and temporarily increase permanent inflation, and vice versa

 The word environment is coined with two words
 "pari" jo hamaare chaaron ore he"aavaran" jo hamen chaaron ore se ghere hue he
 The environment is the collective unit of all the physical, chemical and biological factors that affect an organism or ecological population and determine their form, life and life
 saamaanya arthon main yah hamaare jivan ko prabhavit karne vaale sabhi jaivik or ajaivik tatwon, tathyon, prakriyaaon or ghatnaon ke samucchy se nirmit ikai he
 It is spread all around us and every event of our life takes place inside it and we humans also affect this environment with all our actions
 is prakaar ek jeevadharee or uske paryaavaran ke bich anyonyashray sambandh bhi hota he
 From the microbial bacteria to insects, insects, all living organisms and plants come in the biological components of the environment and along with it all the biological activities and processes
 ajaivik sanghatakon main jeevanarahit tatv or unase judi prakriyaayein aati hai, jaise: chattaane, parvat, nadi, hawa or jalwaayu ke tatv ityadi
 Generally, the environment is defined in terms of man, and man is declared as a separate entity and all other things around him as his environment
 kintu yahan yah bhi dhyatavya he ki abhi bhi is dharti par bahut si maanav sabhyataaen hai, jo apane ko paryaavaran se alag nahin maanatin or unki nazar main samast prakruti ek hi ikai he

 vastutah manushya ko paryaavaran se alag maanane vaale ve hai jo takneekee rup se viksit hai or vigyaan or takanic ke vyapak prayog se apni prakritik dashaon main kaafii badlaav laane main samarth hai
 The environment is divided into two blocks based on human intervention - natural or natural environment and man-made environment
 haalaanki purna rup se prakritik paryaavaran yaa purna roopen maanav nirmit paryaavaran, kahin nahin paae jate
 This division is merely a sign of excess and lack of human intervention in natural processes and conditions
 paristhitiki or paryaavaran bhugol main prakritik paryaavaran shabd kaa prayog paryaavas ke liye bhi hota he
 The activities of the technical human, the extensive tampering with nature to achieve the economic purpose and goals of luxury in life, have destroyed the balance of the natural environment, which has created a crisis on the existence of the natural system or system itself
 is tarah kii samasyaayen paryaavarniya avanayan kehalaati hai
 Environmental problems like pollution, climate change etc
 are motivating humans to rethink about their lifestyle and now there is talk of environmental protection and environmental management
 manushya vaigyanik or takneekee rup se apane dwaara kiye gayi parivartanon se nuksaan ko kitna kam karne main sakasham he, aarthik or rajnatik hiton kii takaraav main paryaavaran par kitna dhyaan diya ja rahaa he or manushyata apane paryaavaran ke prati kitni jaagruk he, yah aaj ke jwalanth prashn hai
 The word environment is derived from the Sanskrit language 'pari' prefix and 'cover' which means a set of things that surround a person or animal
 paristhitiki or bhugol main yah shabd angreji ke environment ke paryaay ke rup main istemaal hota he
 The English word environment itself came to be used much later in the sense of the above ecology and it was used for the general conditions around it in the early stages

 Today the environment remains a rather urgent issue but today there is no awareness among people about it
 gramin samaaj ko chhod den to bhi mahanagareey jivan main iske prati khaas utsukata nahin pai jaati
 As a result, environmental protection has become just a government agenda
 jabaki yah puure samaaj se bahut hi ghanishtha sambandh rakhane vaala sawaal he
 Unless there is a natural attachment among people, environmental protection will remain a distant dream
 paryaavaran kaa sidhaa sambandh prakruti se he
 In our environment, we find a variety of animals, plants and other living and non-living things

 The fundamental principles of the subject and practical subjects related to them are studied in various branches of science, such as physics, chemistry and biology
 parantu aaj kii aavashyaktaa yah he ki paryaavaran ke vistrut adhyayan ke saath-saath isse sambandhit vyaavhaarik gyaan par bal diya jaae
 Modern society should be educated on problems related to the environment on a large scale
 saath hi isse nipatane ke bachaavkaari upayon kii jaankaree bhi aavashyak he
 In today's mechanical era, we are going through such a situation
 pradooshan ek abhishaap ke rup main sampoorn paryaavaran ko nasht karne ke liye hamaare saamne khadaa he
 The whole world is going through a serious challenge

 In fact, there is a need to make the available knowledge related to the environment practical so that the public can easily understand the problem

 Gupta's personality developed from the Vaishnavite rites of the house and Gandhism
 gupt ji swayan shikshit kavi the
 The poetry of Maithilisharan Gupta and his era of knowledge was adopted by Siyaramsharan
 at: unke sabhi kavy dvivedi yugin abhidhaavaadi kalaroop par hi aadhaarit hai
 Both the Gupta brothers have preserved their historically aristocratic poetry form even after being influenced by the new Hindi Movement of Shadowism
 vichaar kii drushti se bhi siyaaramsharan ji jyeshtha bandhu ke sadrush gandhivaad kii pardu:khakaatarata, rashtraprem, vishvaprem, vishwa shanti, hriday parivartanwaad, satya or ahimsa se aaajeevan prabhavit rahe

 This Vaishnav poet did not compromise on all the inconsistencies of the society, but he is resolved like Gandhiji everywhere by changing the heart, not on the basis of class struggle, so do not worry about Shobharam's false stigma in the "lap" Adopts a neglected teenager; "in the final aspiration", Ramlal sacrifices himself for his master and Jamuna of "nari" alone stands steadfastly on the calamity TI lives

 vastut: anek kavy bhi padhyabaddh kathaayen hi hai or gadhy or padya main ek hi ukt mantavya vyakt hua he
 In spite of the lack of dramaturgy and skill in the poetry of Gupta ji, the misuse of the saints like heredity and conglomeration gives his literature the pride of calm, steady, sattvic pomp in the tumult clamor of modern literature to dispel the darkness of animal animality
 In its light, it is situated in self-absorbed and selfless spirit

 The three inner moons - Ganymede, Europa and Ayo participate in a 1: 2: 4 orbital resonance

 Galileo's discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers to show that there were many things in space that could not be seen with the naked eye

 duniya kaa pehla adividrohi rome ke purakhaa adivasee ladaaka spartacas ko mana jaataa he
 While in the history of India's colonial wars, the credit for being the first Adivasi goes to the fighters of the Pahariya primitive tribal community who fought the British rule in the hills of Rajmahal, Jharkhand
 in pahadiya ladaakon main sabase lokapriy adividrohi zebra yaa jorah pahadiya urf tilka maanjhi hai
 Jabra Pahadia was a heroic Adivasi of Pahadia community challenging the British power in India
 singarasi pahaad, pakur ke zebra pahadiya urf tilka maanjhi ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki unka janm 11 farvari 1750 i
 main hua tha
 From 1771 to 1784, he fought a long and never surrender battle against the British power and kept the sleep of the local nobles-feudal and English ruler
 pahadiya ladaakon main sardaar ramana ahaadi or amadapada prakhand ke aamgaachhi pahaad nivasee kariya puzhar or singarasi pahaad nivasee zebra pahadiya bharat ke adividrohi hai
 Spartacus, the ancestral tribal warrior of Rome, is considered to be the world's first abolitionist

 The most popular among these Pahadia fighters is the Adividrohi Jabra or Zaurah Pahadia aka Tilka Manjhi
 inhone 1778 i
 main pahadiya saradaaron se milakar ramgarh camp par kabja karne vaale angrejon ko khaded kar camp ko mukt karaayaa
 In 1784, Jabra killed Cleveland
 baad main irkut ke netritv main zebra kii gorilla sena par jabardast hamalaa hua jisamen kai ladaake maare gaye or zebra ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 It is said that he was dragged in four horses and dragged to Bhagalpur
 par milon ghasite jane ke baavjood vah pahadiya ladaaka jivit tha
 His body drenched in blood was still angry and his red eyes were scaring the British Raj
 bhay se kaanpate hue angrejon ne tab bhagalpur ke chauraahey par sthit ek vishaal vatvriksh par saream lataka kar unki jaan le lee
 In front of a crowd of thousands, Jabra Pahadia aka Tilka Manjhi hung on the gallows
 taarikh thi sambhawatah 13 janvari 1785
 Later thousands of freedom fighters followed Jabra Pahadia and sang the songs that were hanging on the gallows - Hansi - Hansi Chabbo hanged


! - He still reminds us of this tribal
 pahadiya samudaay kaa yah gorilla ladaaka ek aisi kinvadanti he jiske bare main aitihaasik dastavej sirf naam bhar kaa ullekh karte hai, puraa vivaran nahin dete
 But its guerrilla biographies and stories in the ancestral songs and stories of the Pahadia community still present an irresistible claim of being an adivasi after centuries
 tilka maanjhi santal the yaa pahadiya ise lekar vivaad he
 Generally, many writers have described Tilaka Manjhi as Moormal Gotra and termed them as Santal tribals
 parantu tilka ke santal hone kaa koi aitihaasik dastavej or likhit pramaan maujuud nahin he
 At the same time, according to historical documents, the people of the Santal tribal community came and settled towards the Santal Pargana after 1790 due to the famine of 1770
 The Annals of Rural Bengal, Volume 1, 1868 By Sir William Wilson Hunter main saaf likhaa he ki santal log birbhum se aaj ke singhbhum kii taraf nivas karte the
 During the famine of 1790, they migrated to present-day Santal Parganas
 hunter ne likhaa he, ‘1792 se santalon nayaa itihaas shuru hota he’ 
 By 1838 Hunter reported the settlement of 40 villages of Santals in Santal Pargana, in which their total population was 3000
 hunter yah bhi bataata he ki 1847 tak mi
 ward ne 150 gaanvon main kareeb ek lakh santalon ko basaaya 
 The Bengal District Gazetteer: Santal Pargana, published in 1910, volume 13 contains LSS
 o Meli wrote that when Mr
 When the ward was determining the boundary of Damine Koh in 1827, it met 3 villages in Santals in Patsunda and 27 villages in Barkop
 ward ke anusaar, ‘ye log khud ko santar kehete hai jo singhbhum or udhar ke ilaake ke rahane vaale hai
 The authentic account of the settlements of the santams at Daminekoh is available on pages 97 to 99 of the Bengal District Gazetteer: Santal Parganas
 iske atirikt aar
 carstares jo 1885 se 1898 tak santal pargana kaa dipti kamishnar rahaa tha, usne apane upanyaas ‘haadma kaa gaanv’ kii shuruyaat hi pahadiya logon ke ilaake main santalon ke basane ke tathy se kii he
 Like other tribal communities, the tradition of naming the child in the name of ancestors is also in the santhas
 But in the past, even today, the name of a person is not found 'tilaka'
 lekin pahadiya samudaay ke logon main aaj bhi ‘zebra’ naam rakhane kaa prachlan he
 The British called Jabra Pahadia a dreaded dacoit and an angry Manjhi
 santalon main bhi maanjhi hote hai or badi aabaadi va 1855 ke hul ke kaaran ve zyada jane gaye, isliye tilka maanjhi urf zebra pahadiya ke santal adivasee hone kaa bhram failaa
 In fact, Jabra directly pretended to be loyal to the British rule as the army hero of the 'pahadia Hill Rangers' formed by the then District Collector of Bhagalpur and changed the name to 'tilaka' Manjhi with his hundreds of fighters in guerrilla manner
 From the British, the rulers were at war with the nobles and the nobles
 vaise, pahadiya bhashaa main ‘tilka’ kaa arth he gussell or laal-laal ankhon vaala vyakti
 Since he was the village head and it is the custom in the Pahadia community to call the village head as Manjhi
 isliye hill rangers kaa sardaar jorah urf zebra maanjhi tilka maanjhi ke naam se vikhyath ho gaye
 Jabra Pahadia is also present in British documents but Tilaka is not mentioned anywhere
 bangla kii suprasiddh lekhika mahasweta devi ne tilka maanjhi ke jivan or vidroh par bangla bhashaa main ek upanyaas 'shalagirar daake' kii rachana kii he
 In this novel, Mahashweta Devi has described Tilaka Manjhi as the Santal tribal of Murmu gotra
 yah upanyaas hindi main 'shalagirah kii pukaar par' naam se anuvaadit or prakashit hua he
 While Hindi novelist Rakesh Kumar Singh has portrayed Tilka Manjhi as Jabra Pahadia in his novel 'hool Pahadiya'
 ‘hul pahadiya’ upanyaas 2012 main prakashit hua he

 The war of Mahabharata had become unavoidable between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, so when Barbarik received this news, his desire to join the war was also aroused
 jab ve apni maan se aashirwad praapt karne pahunche tab maan ko haare hue paksh kaa saath dene kaa vachan diya
 He headed towards the battlefield of Kurukshetra with his three arrows and a bow on his Leela horse, blue in color

 On hearing this, Barbarik replied that only one arrow is enough to defeat the enemy army and after doing so, the arrow will return to the Tarkas
 yadi teenon baanon ko prayog main liya gaya to teenon lokon main haahaakaar much jayega
 At this Shri Krishna challenged him to pierce all the letters of this peepal tree, under which both were standing
 barbaric ne chunauti sweekaar kii or apane tunir se ek baan nikaala or ishwar ko samaran kar baan ped ke patton kii ore chalaaya
 The arrow momentarily pierced all the leaves of the tree and began to spin around Srikrishna's foot, as he had hidden a leaf under his foot, Barbaric said that you remove your foot or else it is your foot

 Exception handling is a programming language structure or computer hardware mechanism designed to handle decreasing exceptions, a special state that changes the normal speed of program implementation
 programing bhashaaen apwaad sanchaalan ke apane samarthan main atyadhik bhinn hoti hai prakaarya kisi bhi input ke liye 0 fal de saktaa he jise kisi maanya maan main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 aisi bhashaaon main programmer ko chahie ki yaa to vah bhul jaanch kare yaa vaidhikaran input kare 
 The degree to which such definitive validation and error checking is required is in contrast to the exception handling aid provided by a given programming environment
 hardware apwaad sanchaalan software aujaaron dwaara pradat sahaayta se kuch alag hota he, lekin inke liye samaan pariklpana or shabd hi prachlit hai
 In general, exceptions are managed by saving the current state of execution in a predefined space and switching the execution to a fixed subroutine called exception operator
 yah sthiti par nirbhar karata he, ki baad main sanchaalak surakshit soochna kaa upyog karte hue nishpaadan ko mul jagah par phir se shuru kare
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek prishth dosha aamtaur par program ko phir se shuru karne kii anumati detii he, jabaki shunya ke dwaara ek divijan paardarshee rup main samaadhaan karne yogya nahin ho saktaa
 From processing considerations, hardware interrupts are similar to resumable exceptions, although they are not specifically associated with the user's program flow
 routine ke lekhak ke vichaar se apwaad kaa paidaa hona yah sanket dene kaa upyogi madhyam he ki ek routine saamaanya rup se nahin chal sakati
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek input tark amaanya hota he yaa ek sansaadhan jis par yah nirbhar karata he, vah uplabdh nahin hota he 
 apwaad rahit pranaaliyon main, rutin ke liye yah jaruri hota he ki ve kuch vishisht routine code truti ko lautaae
 haalanki, kabhi-kabhi ardhvishisht samasya ke dwaara yah jatil ho jaati he, jisamen routine ke prayog karta ko samaanya lautaan mulya se bhramaatmak mulya ko alag karne ke liye atiriktt code likhane kii jarurat hoti he
 In routine engine environments such as Java or 
NET, tools exist that are associated with routines, and all the time exceptions of interest are recorded that hide hidden information that is in memory when the exception is thrown
 She lives These devices are called automatic exception handling or error prevention tools and report the "main cause" of exceptions
 samakaleen anuprayogon ko apwaad sanchaalan ranneetiyon par vichaar karte samay kai tarah kii dizin chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Exceptions, especially in modern enterprise-level applications, must exceed process limitations and machine boundaries
 yah pahchaanana ki ek prakriya ek vindu par, jahaan yah prakriya ke software hisse ke dwaara aasaani se sanchalit nahin kii ja sakati, asafal ho jaati he, vah ek thos apwaad sanchaalan ranneeti kii dijin kaa bhaag he
 a piece of code is said to be exception-safe if run-time failures within the code do not cause bad effects such as memory revelation, accumulated data ambiguity, or invalid results
 The exception-protection code must satisfy the invariants placed in the code, even if exceptions occur
 There are several levels of exception protection: udhaaharan ke liye, C++'s std :: vector yaa java eroy suchi jaise ek samart vector tip par vichaar karen
 When an item x is added to a vector v, the vector must add x to the Internet list of the object and update the count field that indicates how many substances are in v
 nayi smriti ko abantit karne kii bhi jarurat pad sakati he yadi maujuud kshamta paryaapt badi nahin he
 This memory allocation may fail and cause an exception
 is vajah se, ek vector jo vifal paardarshita pradaan karata he use likhnaa bahut mushkil yaa asambhav hota he
 However, the vector can fairly easily guarantee a strong exception, in which case, entering v of x can either be successful or v remains unchanged
 agar vector keval aadharbhoot apwaad suraksha guarantee pradaan karata he, agar antarvesh asafal hota he, v x ko dhaarit kar bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi, lekin yah kam se kam saamaan avasthaa main rahegaa
 haalanki, agar vector keval nunatam guarantee detaa he, yah sambhav he ki vector amaanya ho jaye
 udhaaharan ke liye, shaayad v kaa kshetra aakaar badhaayaa gaya tha lekin vastav main avasthaa ko asangat karte hue x ko pravesh nahin karaayaa gaya tha
 Of course, without guarantee, the program may crash; Perhaps the extension of the vector was needed but it could not allocate the memory and blindly excavated the front area by touching the memory at the invalid address as if the allocation had been successful
 aamtaur par kam se kam buniyadi apwaad suraksha kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Fail transparency is difficult to implement and is usually not possible in libraries where full usage information is not available
 apwaad sanchaalan routine kaa aashay yah he ki vah sunishchit kare ki code truti kii sthiti ko sambhaal saktaa he
 Routines are sufficiently robust to establish exception operations, requiring code to represent a broad spectrum of invalid or unexpected input, such as those created by mutation testing and via software fault injection
 can go 
 One of the most difficult software is protocol software, in which exception operations are written to routines, since a robust protocol implementation must be built to receive input that does not consider the update attribute
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki ek softver vikaas jeevanchakra prakriya kaa puraa arthpurna pratigaman vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he, koi bhi apwaad sanchaalan jaanch purnatah swachaalit hona chahie or pareekshan ke maamle vaigyanik, duhraaye jane yogya aacharan main hi paidaa kiye jane chahiye
 aisi kai vanijyik vyavasthaaen hai jo ki is tarah kaa pareekshan karti hai
 Many computer languages such as, Action Script, ADA, Bleitzmax, c ++, D, ECMA Script, Ifel, Java, ML, Object Pascal objective-c Ocaml, PL / 1, Prolog, Pithon, Real Basic, Ruby, Visual Prolog and most of the net Languages are designed to support exceptions and exception handling

 The Common Lisp exception calls the operator and does not open the stack
 yah thik usee jagah se compyutesan ko jari rakhane kii anumati detaa he, jahaan truti paidaa hui thi 
 mythril kaa stacles karyanvayan stack ko khole bina sthir-samay apwaad sanchaalan kii sahaayta karata he
 Except for minor syntactic differences, only two exception handling methods are in use
 In the most popular method, an exception is initiated by an exception substance, or a special statement with the value of a particular incremental numbered type
 apwaad sanchaalkon ke liye marker cloj ke saath gunjaaish shuru hoti he or pratham sanchaalak cloj kii shuruuaat main khatm ho jaati he
 Many operators follow the clause and the exception type that they handle, and give a detailed description of the name they use for the exception substance
 kuch ek bhashaaen bhi cloj ko permit karti hai jo us haalat main upyog kii jaati hai jab sanchaalak kii gunjaaish kii pahunch ke pehle koi apwaad ghatit nahin hota
 a related clause is more general which is typically executed to release the resources acquired within the exception-handling block of the body whether an exception occurs or not
 In particular, c ++ does not need to build and does not provide either and the resource acquisition-initiation technique should be used to free up such a resource
 apni purnataa main, apwaad sanchaalan code is tarah kaa dikh saktaa he : ) ) pakadana, invariant ko punarsthapit kar object kii sthiti ko sthir karte hue
 Here is an example expressed in the Eiffel syntax
 yah aashwast karata he ki teevr gati se_bhejo routine saamanyat: sandesh bhejne kaa ek behatar madhyam he, lekin apwaad shuru hone par, yah vifal ho saktaa he; yadi aisa hota he to elgorithm iske baad dhire_bhejo kaa upyog karata he, jo praaia: kam hi vifal hota he
 If slow_send fails, the entire sent routine must be wicked as an exception occurs in the caller
 he Local karen Rescue antabulian sthaneey char ko shuru main falls karne ke liye shuru kiya jaataa he
 If send_fast fails, the body will be executed again, causing the execution of slow_send
 If this slow_send execution fails, the rescue clause will end up with no entry, failing the entire routine execution
 is drushtikon ko spasht rup se "saamaanya" or "asaamaanya" kya he, ko paribhaashit karne kaa shrey he: ek saamaanya maamla jo nishpaadan ko utpann karata he, vah he jiske qaraar ko routine puraa nahin kar paati
 It defines a clear distribution of the role: the duo's obligation is to achieve, or try to achieve, the obligation of the defense clause is to restore the case and restart the process if it is likely to succeed
 , But there is no obligation to perform any real computation
 java ke diziner jaanche hue apwaadon kii yojana banaate hai, jo apwaad kii vishesh dhaancha hote hai
 The test exceptions that a method may raise are part of the signature of the method
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek paddati ek ai0apwaad phenk sakati he to use is tathy ko apni paddati hastakshar main ghoshit karnaa chahie
 Failure to do this gives rise to a compile time error
 yah apwaad jaanchakartaaon ke saath judi hoti he jo kam se kam ocaml ke liye maujuud rahete hai
 External devices for ocaml are both transparent and optional
 Clu programing bhashaa ke paas interphes yukt ek visheshta thi, kuch-kuch waisi hi jaisaa java ne baad main shuru kiya
 a function can only create exceptions mentioned in its type, but any leaking exception called will automatically turn into a Sol runtime exception, failed, even though it results in a compile-time error
 Later, Modula-3 had similar feature
 ye suvidhaayen sankalan samay jaanch ko shaamil nahin karti jo jaanch kiye hue apwaad kii pariklpana ke kendra main he or jinhen java ke alaava anya kisi programing bhashaa main nigamit nahin kiya gaya he 
 The c ++ programming language provides an alternative mechanism to the checked exceptions known as exception specifications
 difolt rup se koi bhi prakaarya apwaad thro kar saktaa he, lekin ise prakaarya hastakshar main jode gaye thro cloj ke dwaara simit kiya ja saktaa he, jo yah vinirdisht karata he ki kis apwaad ko thro kiya jaay
 apwaad vinirdesh sankalan samay par jabardastee lagu nahin kiya jaataa
 vaishvik samaaroh main ulanghan parinaam ko astidi:apratyaashit ko bulaayaa ja rahaa he
 An empty exception specification can be given that indicates that the function will not throw any exceptions
 apwaad sanchaalan ko bhashaa ke saath jodate samay ise difolt nahin banaaya gaya tha kyonki maujuuda code main bahut saare sudhaar kii jarurat hoti, dusri bhashaaon main likhe code ke saath ant:kriya karne main yah aadchan paidaa karata, tathaa sthaneey str par yah bahut saare sanchaalak lekhan ke liye programmeron ko aakarshith karata
 khaali apwaad vinirdeshon kaa spasht upyog, halanki mahatvapurn code or stack leout ke anukulan pradarshan karne ke liye C++ sankalkon ko anumati de saktaa he jise us samay dabaa dena padataa he jab ek prakaarya main apwaad sanchaalan ghatit hota he
 Some analysts are of the opinion that it is difficult to achieve proper use of exception specifications in c ++
 aagaamee C++ bhashaa maanak main, vartmaan sanskaran main sunishchit maanak apwaad vinirdesh kaa upyog asweekrut ho jaataa he
 Checked exceptions, at accumulated time, reduce the occurrence of unstructured exception surfacing at runtime in a given use; Whereas unchecked exceptions remain unmanaged
 haalanki, jaanche hue apwaadon ko yaa to vyapak thro ghoshnaaon, karyanvayan vivaran ko vyakt karne tathaa samputikaran ko kam karne kii jarurat hoti he, yaa aswasth tareeke se-vichaarit tri / kaich rukawaton ko badhaava dene kii, jo mul apwaadon ko unke uchit sanchaalkon se chupa sakati he
 Consider an evolving code base based on time
 ek interphes x or y apwaadon ko thro karne ke liye ghoshit ho sakati he
 In a later version of the code, if a z wants to throw an exception, it will create a new code as opposed to the earlier use
 Also, according to the optimizer method, where a body of code declares an interface that is then implemented by a different code body so that the code can be invoked and called by the first one, the adapter code May have a rich exception handout to explain problems, but it is forced to use the declared interface exception type
 ghoshit apwaadon kii sankhya ko yaa to kshamtapurvak phenke gaye sabhi apwaadon ke ek superklas ko ghoshit kar ke yaa un apwaad tip ko paribhaashit or ghoshit kar ke kam kiya ja saktaa he, jo kathith vidhi ke sankshepan ke str or in tipon ke nichle str ke pratichitran, khaskar mul kaaran kii sangraksha hetu apwaad shrankhlan ke aachhadit prayog ke liye uchit hote hai
 In addition, it is very possible that the above example of variable interfaces also requires correction of the calling code, since by some opinions the exceptions that can be thrown by a method are also part of the interface inherent to that method
 
 thro apwaad ghoshnaa yaa kaich kaa kam se kam prayog jaanch santusht karne ke liye paryaapt hote he
 While it may have some use, it essentially impedes the checked exception mechanism
 iske atirikt, thro apwaad sabhi colling code ko aisa karne ke liye majaboor karata he
 Uncontrolled exception types cannot be handled with thought, except at the external level of opportunity
 These often: represent scenarios that do not allow the same condition to occur again: runtimeupism repeatedly reflects programming faults, and errors typically represent unrecoverable jvime failures
 mat yah he ki us jaanche hue apwaadon kaa saath dene vaali bhashaa main bhi aise maamle hote hai, jahaan jaanche hue apwaadon kaa upyog sahi nahin hota
 Synchronous exceptions have something to do with the concept of checked exceptions
 tulykaalik apwaad ek vishesh program statement main ghatit hote hai, aisi aavastha main tulykaalik apwaad vyavhaar main kahin bhi prakat ho sakate hai
 It seems that asynchronous exception handling by compilers may not be required
 It is also difficult to program with them
 swabhaavik rup se atulykaalik ghatnaon ke udhaaharan main ek program ko rokane ke liye ctrl-c ko dabaanaa or anya nishpaadan ke thrid se "rokie" yaa "nirast karen" jaisaa sanket praapt karnaa shaamil hai
 Programming languages in particular deal with this by limiting asynchrony, for example Java has lost stopping and restarting threads
 iske bajaay ardh atulykaalik apwaad bhi ho sakate hai jo keval tulykaalik yaa program ke uchit sthanon main hi paidaa hote hai
 Common Lisp, Dylan and Smalltalk have state systems that include the above exception handling systems
 un bhashaaon yaa pariveshon main ek avasthaa kaa aagaman ek prakaarya ko suchit karata he or apwaad sanchaalkon kii keval deree se stack ko kholane kaa nirnay liya ja saktaa he
 States are generalizations of exceptions
 jab ek shart uthta he, ek upyukt avasthaa sanchaalak ko khoja jaataa he or stack aandar main, shart sanchaalan ke liye use chunaa jaataa he
 States that do not represent errors can remain completely unmanaged, their only purpose being to send a signal or warning to the user
 yah tathakthith apwaad sanchaalan ke punargrahan model se sambandhit he, jisamen kathith taur par kuch apwaad jari rahane vaale hote hai: abhivyakti tak lautne kii anumati di jaati he jo sanchaalak main ek sudharatmak karrwai ke pashchaat apwaad ko sanket detaa he
 The state of the system is generalized as follows: Under a non-critical state, it is possible to jump to predefined restart points, which are present between the signaling expression and the state operators
 ristart ve prakaarya hai jo avasthaa sanchaalkon ko puri tarah baahar nikaalane yaa aanshik rup se hi stack ko kholane ke pehle programmer ko is parivesh kii marammat kii anumati dete hue kuch kosh-vishyak parivesh ke sameep hote hai
 The state provides isolation of the mechanism from the operation policy
 ristart trutiyon ko thik karne ke liye vibhinn sambhav yantrawali pradaan karte hai, lekin di hui sthiti ke liye koun si yantrawali upyukt he, iskaa chunaav nahin karte
 yahi ek avasthaa sanchaalak kaa kaary kshetra he, jisaki pahunch vyapak drushti tak hoti he
 An example: Suppose is a library function intended to instruct a single syslog file entry
 is prakaarya ko kya karnaa chahie yadi pravishti vikrut ho jaati he
 There is no single right answer, as the same library can be deployed in programs for many different purposes
 ek interactive log fil brouzar main, karne kii sahi baat pravishti ko bina padvyakhya ke lautaa dena ho sakati he, jisase prayogkarta ise dekh sake - lekin ek swachaalit log-samaraising program main sahi cheez karnaa yah ho sakati he ki apthaneey kshetron ke liye shunya maanon kii aapurti kii jaay, baski ek truti ke saath vifal kiya jaay agar bahut sari pravishtiyaan vikrut ho jaati hai
 That is to say, this question can be answered based on the broad goal of the program, which is not known as the general-purpose library function
 phir bhi, truti sandesh ke saath baahar nikalnaa shaayad hi kabhi sahi uttar ho saktaa he
 Instead of simply exiting with an error, the function can set up a restart by offering various ways to continue - for example to skip the log entry, to supply null values for unreadable fields, To ask the user for lost values, or to open the stack and fail the processing with an error message
 The introduced restart constitutes the mechanism derived from the errors, the state handlers supply the restart policy selection policy
