 swing gendbaaji cricket ke khel main gendbaaji kii ek takanic he
 Those who use it are called swing bowlers
 swing gendbaazi, tej gendbaazi ke upaprakaar ke rup main vargeekrut he
 The essence of swing bowling is to divert the cricket ball from its path towards the batsman or away from him as he moves in the air
 Bowlers use five tools to do this
 gend kii vishmata banaaye rakhane ke liye chhetrarakshan karne vaali team ke khilaadi gend ke ek taraf ko nirantar chamakaane kaa kaary karte hai jabaki duusari taraf ko tut - foot se bigadane dete hai
 Over time they produce a clear distinction on the aerodynamic properties of both sides of the ball
 ashaant or patleey bahaav donon swing main yogadan dete hai
 The air in the plane flow leaves the surface of the ball first instead of the turbulent flow, so that the separation point diverges towards the front side of the ball
 Towards the turbulent flow, the air stays in the backward direction, which generates more lifting force towards the turbulent flow of the ball
 dekhe gaye swing raashi ke liye pariklit kul uthaav bal paryaapt nahin hota
 The additional force is given by the gradient force
 dabaav dhaal bal prerit karne ke liye gendbaaj ko gend kii ulti taraf ucch or nimna sthitik dabaav ke kshetra bananaa chahie
 The ball is then pulled from the area of high static pressure to the area of low static pressure
 maganas prabhaav yahi bal kaa upyog karata he, lekin gati kii disha bhar main spin ko herpher karke | taral padaarth kii ek parat, is maamle main hawa main, ek thos padaarth kii parat kii tulana main koi duusari taral padaarth kii parat par adhik veg se aage badhati he
 When the velocity of the liquid is high then its static pressure will be less
 jab gend nayaa hota he tab sivan gend kii ek taraf ashaant hawa kii parat banane ke liye prayog kii jaati he, aisa gend ko ek taraf jhukaake or sivan ke saath ghuma ke kiya jaataa he
 This changes the air separation point with the ball; This creates a greater air coverage, providing turbulent air lift
 ashaant hawa ke taraf vaali disha main hawa kii agali parat main hawa ke adhik vyapti kii vajah se adhik veg hoga or jaisaa kii hawa kii gati main antar he isse gend kii donon taraf kaa sthitik dabaav bhi alag hoga
 As a result, the ball will move towards its turbulent flow and be pulled
 jab gend puraani hoti he or khurdarapan main vishmata hoti he tab sivan koi dabaav antar kaa kaaran nahin banataa he, or vastav main vah gend kii swing ko kam kar sakati he
 Turbulence of the air is no longer used to cause separation point differences and therefore to bevel and pressure differences
 gend ke kharduri taraf gend kii sataha par kharonch or gadde hai
 This irregularity acts like a golf ball dimple
 yah aniyamitata hawa ko fasaati he jisase gend ke kharduri taraf ke bagal main fasee hui hawa kii parat banati he joki gend kii sataha ke saath aage badhati he
 The smooth side of the ball does not trap air
 khurdure paksh main gend se baahar kii taraf hawa kii agali parat main adhik veg hota he
 This is due to its exposure to trapped air layer rather than solid ball
 isse sthitik dabaav chamakdaar paksh kii tulana main kam ho jaataa he joki gend ko swing karaata he

 In Euclidean plane geometry, a quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides and four vertices
 "chaturbhuj " shabd kii utpatti do latin shabdon 'quadri', jiskaa arth he 'chaar kaa ek sanskaran', or 'latus', jiskaa arth he "bhujaa", se hui he
 Quadrilaterals are simple or complex
 saral chaturbhuj uttal yaa avatal hote hai
 The sum of the interior angles of a simple quadrilateral ABCD is 360 °, that is, ∠ a + ∠ b + ∠ c + ∠ d = 360 ∘ 
 { \ displaystyle \ angle A+ \ angle B+ \ angle C+ \ angle D=360^{ \ circ }
} This is obtained by the internal angle sum formula × 180 °

 Square: All four sides are equal, and all four angles are right angles
 sammukh bhujaayen samanaantar hoti hai, vikarn ek duusare ko samdvibhajit karte hai or samaan lambaai ke hote hai
 a quadrilateral will be a square if it is a rhombus and also a rectangle
 patangakaar chaturbhuj : asann bhujaaon ke do yugma baraabar lambaai ke hote hai
 This means that one of its diagonals divides the quadrilateral into two congruent triangles, and so the angles between two pairs of equal sides are equal
 iske donon vikarn ek duusare ke lambavat hote hai
 Tactile Quadrilateral: The four arms are tangent lines of an incircle
 ek uttal chaturbhuj, ek chakree chaturbhuj hoga yadi isaki sammukh bhujaaon kaa yoga samaan ho

 a convex quadrilateral ABCD which has sides a = AB, b = BC, c = CD and d = DA has various general formulas to find the area
 trikoshmetiya sutara The area k { \ displaystyle K} of a quadrilateral can be expressed in trigonometric terms as follows- k = 1 2 p q ⋅ sin ⁡ θ, { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}pq \ cdot \ sin \ theta ,} Where p { \ displaystyle p} and q { \ displaystyle q} are the lengths of the diagonals and the angle between them is θ { \ displaystyle \ theta}

 For the area of a quadrilateral with angle α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} between the sides a, b, c, d { \ displaystyle a, b, c, d} and the sides a { \ displaystyle a} and b { \ displaystyle b} The final trigonometric formula is the following: k = 1 2 a b ⋅ sin ⁡ α + 1 4 4 c 2 d 2 − 2 , { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}ab \ cdot \ sin { \ alpha }+{ \ tfrac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt {4c^{2}d^{2}-^{2}}},} This formula can also be used for the area of a concave quadrilateral, just replacing the first + sign with -
 gaiyr-trikoshmetiya sutara The following two formulas express the area in the positions of the sides a, b, c, d, semi-dimension s and diagonals p and q
 k = − 1 4 , { \ displaystyle K={ \ sqrt {-{ \ tfrac {1}{4 xxrep 4 } ,} k = 1 4 4 p 2 q 2 - 2
 { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {4}} { \ sqrt {4p ^ {2} q ^ {2} - \ left ^ {2 xxrep 4 } 
} dvimadhyikaon m, n or vikarnon p, q ke padon main bhi kshetrafal kaa sutara vyakt kiya ja saktaa he- k = 1 2, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} { \ sqrt {}},} k = 1 2 p 2 q 2 − 2 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}{ \ sqrt {p^{2}q^{2}-^{2}}}
} In fact, only three values of m, n, p and q are sufficient for the area because these four values in a quadrilateral are related as follows - p 2 + q 2 = 2
 { \ displaystyle p ^ {2} + q ^ {2} = 2

 pratham vishwayuddh, samaajawaadee andolan ke liye ek mahatvapurn ghatana thi
 While on the one hand the socialist movement and their international organization almost disintegrated at the beginning of it, on the other hand, there was a Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the foundation of the first successful socialist state in the world, which had a profound impact on the socialist movements of the world
 
 pratham mahayuddh ke purv samaajawaadee dalon kaa mat tha ki poonjivadi vyavastha hi yudhon ke liye uttaradaayi he or yadi vishwayuddh aarambh hua to prayek samaajawaadee dal kaa kartavya hona chahie ki vah apni poonjeewaadi sarkaar kii yudhniti kaa virodh kare or grihayuddh dwaara samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye prayatnsheel ho
 But as soon as the war started, except for the socialist parties of Russia and Italy, the majority of all the parties supported the policy of their governments
 samaajwaadiyon ke keval ek naganya alpamat ne hi yuddh kaa virodh kiya or aage chalakar inamen se kuch vladimir lenin or uske samyavaadee antarrashtriya sanghathan ke samarthak bane
 But due to the conflicting tactics of the socialist movements of different countries, their unity came to an end
 bolshevik dal rus ke kai samaajawaadee dalon main se ek tha
 It was successful under the special circumstances of 1917
 roosi samaajwaad kii parshwabhoomi anya europea samaajawaadon kii sthiti se bhinn thi
 The Russian Empire was lagging behind the leading countries of Europe in industry trade, so the majority of the working class could not be more influential here

 Among those thinkers are Hergen, Lavrov, Charnyshevsky and Bakunin

 In this way the foundation of Narodnik mass movement was laid and Narodanya Volya organization was formed
 san 1901 main iskaa naam saamaajik krantikari party rakhaa gaya
 By the time of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, it was the largest socialist party in Russia, but its area of influence was mostly rural people
 iske vam paksh ne bolshevik kranti kaa samarthan kiya
 The second socialist ideology, which included the Bolshevik Party, is also known as the Russian Social People's Labor Party
 iskaa prabhaav mukhyat: naagarik majdoor varg main tha
 Industries in Russia were few, but large in scale and hired more workers than expected
 at: in mazdooron main raajnneetik chetana or sanghathan adhik tha
 In the absence of democracy, it was difficult for the workers to struggle, so the working class came under revolutionary influence and due to the conditions like Germany, most of the labor leaders here were also influenced by Marxist and Germany's Social Democratic Party
 san 1890 ke lagbhag excrod or plekhanov ne petersvarg main pratham majdoor samooh sthapit kiye jo aage chalakar 1898 main roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke aadhaar bane
 The leader of the Russian Social Democratic Democratic Labor Party was a staunch Marxist, so he rejected recapitalism and developed Marxism and applied it to Russian conditions
 mazdooron kii rahan sahan ke str main unnati hui thi, is satya ko na maananaa kathin tha, parantu plekhanov ne siddh kiya ki nai mashiinon ke prayog or mazdooree main apekshaya vruddhi na hone ke kaaran poonjeewaadi shoshan kii dar badhati ja rahi he
 Bukharin argued that imperialist countries were able to keep their working class satisfied by exploiting the colonies
 tratski aadi ne kaha ki poonjeewaadi kaa sankat sarvyaapee ho gaya he or is sthiti main yah sambhav he ki kranti pashchim europe ke agrani deshon main na hokar apekshaakrit pichde deshon main, jahaan samrajyavaadee kadi sabase kamjor he, vahaan ho
 Some thinkers first showed Russia the location of the socialist revolution
 tratski or lenin kaa mat tha ki samaajawaadee kranti usee samay safal ho sakati he jab vah kai deshon main ek saath faile, sthaayee kranti ke bina keval ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana kathin he
 Later Lenin and Stalin amended this principle to create Soviet power on the basis of unilateral socialism
 nikolai lenin ne uparyukt vichaaron kaa samanvay karke bolshevik dal kaa sanghathan or oktober kranti kaa netritv kiya
 At the London Conference of 1903, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party articulated its socialist ideal, but within this class party two ideologies emerged and later they formed two parties
 is conference main utpaadan ke sadhano ke rashtriyakaran, jameendaari unmoolan, upniveshon kaa aatmanirmaan kaa adhikaar, dhyey kii prapti kaa krantikari maarg or kranti ke baad sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee-is niti ko sweekaar kiya gaya, parantu dal ke sanghathan ke sambandh main netaaon main matbhed ho gaya
 The question was whether the membership of the party should be limited only to the workers or every person accepting the ideals should be its officer and should the Central Committee have the right to dissolve the branches of the party and appoint new branches in their place? Lenin was in favor of a well-organized party with military discipline and had a majority in the conference, hence the name of this section was Bolshevik and the second section was called Menshevik
 aage chalakar in dalon ke bich or bhi matbhed upasthit hue
 The Menshevik Party first wanted to end the capitalist democratic revolution of the end of Tsarism and in this revolution, it wanted to cooperate with the left side of the capitalist parties, but after the revolution of 1905, Lenin and his companions came to the conclusion that due to fear of socialist revolution, capitalism Has become reactionary, therefore it is also unable to lead the capitalist democratic revolution
 isliye is kranti kaa netritv bhi keval sarvhaara varg hi kar saktaa he or is kranti ko sarvhaara kranti ke saath milakar jaarshahi ke baad ekadam samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav he
 Lenin was in favor of dividing feudal land among the peasants in order to get the support of the peasants in the revolution, the Mensheviks wanted to socialize it immediately
 bolshevik dal ne pratham mahayuddh kaa virodh kiya or samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye grihayuddh kaa naaraa diya
 The war-torn public, and especially the Russian troops, welcomed this policy, but the Mensheviks did not oppose the war and continued the war by joining the government after the February March revolution
 san 1917 kii oktober kranti main lenin ke vichaaron or bolshevik sanghathan kii vijay hui
 After the Paris Commune of 1871, in 1917, the first permanent socialist state - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established

 Within the country, initially the representatives of peasants, laborers and soldiers were ruled by mixed Soviets, but according to the constitution of 1936, a bicameral parliament was established
 iske upree sadan kaa chunaav soviet desh ke vibhinn ganraajyon dwaara hota he tathaa nimna sadan ke sadsy kshetreey nirvachan kshetron dwaara chune jate hai
 But Soviet countries are one-party states, the state power is in the hands of communist party
 kisi duusare dal ko raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar nahin
 After the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party named itself the Communist Party and in 1919 published a second Communist Manifesto, on the basis of which a new international movement - Communist International - was established and with its help started the propagation of communism in various countries

 In Asia too, communism was successful in a large country like China and under the influence of Soviet and People's Republic of China, the rule of North Asia and North Vietnam came under communist influence
 samyawad kaa asar sabhi deshon main badha
 Countries such as France, Italy and Hindustia have powerful communist parties
 parantu samyawad ke prasar ne us andolan ke saamne kai saidhantik or vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyaan upasthit kii hai- Communist Yugoslavia's ruler Josip Brozovit Tito and his other communist allies were the first to challenge the Soviet leadership
 yugoslavia bahut kuch apane prayatnon se swatantra hua tha at: uske andar swabhimaan kii bhaavana thi
 He was also not surrounded by Soviet influence like other communist countries of East Europe
 yugoslav paksh kaa kahana tha ki soviet sarkaar unki audyogic unnati main baadhak he tathaa unki swatantraaa ko simit karti he
 His stanzas later proved to be true, but at that time Titoism was called the pivot of recidivism, Trotskyism or imperialism
 siddhant ke str par titowad ne rashtriya samyavad, shakti ke vikendrikaran, kisaanon dwaara bhoomi kaa nijee swaamitv, rajya or naukarshahi ke sthaan main udyogon par mazdooron kaa niyantran tathaa samyavaadee dal or desh ke andar apekshaakrit adhik swadhinata par jor diya
 Tito's ideas have had an impact on other communist countries in Eastern Europe
 samyavaadee deshon ke bich samanta kii maang ko sweekaar karke khrushchov ne titowad ko anshat: sweekaar kiya, parantu saath hi usne lenin stallinavaad main bhi kai mahatvapurn sanshodhan kiye hai
 Lenin thought that until the end of imperialism, wars would continue in the world, but according to Khrushkov, at this time the powers of progress are so strong that world war can be stopped and peaceful coexistence between capitalist and socialist systems is possible
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki in paristhitiyon main samaajwaad kii sthapana kaa keval krantikari maarg hi nahin he, varan vibhinn deshon main alag alag samyavaadee dalon dwaara vikasvaadi or shantimay tareekon se bhi uski sthapana sambhav he
 In the other countries of the world, the above thought change has had a profound effect on communist ideology
 tito ke vidroh ke baad purv europe ke anya samyavaadee deshon ne bhi soviet prabhaav se swatantra hone kaa praytn kiya he
 The Russian communists reject Khrushchev's amendments and the military conflict between the Soviet and China is not only getting worse
 sansar ke lagbhag sabhi samyavaadee dal soviet or chini vichaardhaaraon ke aadhaar par vibhakt hote ja rahe hai kuch vichaarak rashtriya samyavaadee dalon kii saidhantik or sanghathanaatmak swatantraaa par bhi jor dete hai
 Thus the unity and internationalism of communist ideas and movement is declining
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad samyawad kii hi nahin loktantratmak samaajwaad kii bhi pragati hui he
 In the midst of the two great wars Britain had twice as many working governments

 Nadighati schemes require a lot of engineering capability in execution and operation

 An electric motor is an electrochemical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy; That is, when it is connected to the appropriate power source, it starts rotating, due to which the machine or machine attached to it also starts rotating
 arthath yah vidyut janitr kaa ulta kaam karti he jo yantric urja lekar vidyut urja paidaa karata he
 Some motors also operate as both motors or generators in different circumstances
 vidyut motor vidyut urja ko yantric urja main parinat karne ke saadhan hai
 Electric motor is an important indicator of industrial progress
 yah ek badi saral tathaa badi upyogi mashin he
 There is hardly any purpose in industries for which an appropriate electric motor cannot be selected
 vidyut motaron kaa mul uddeshy vidyutchumbakeey bal / balaghurna utpann karke stater or roter ke bich aapekshik gati paidaa karnaa he
 In this way, electric motor takes mechanical work by taking electrical energy
 motor kii vinding ke dharawahi chaalkon par lagane vaala lorange bal nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara abhivyakt hota he- The mechanical power generated by the motor is given by the following equation Pem- jahaan shaft kii koniya chaal radian prati second main tathaa t newton-meter main honi chaiye
 For linear motors, jahaan f newton main tathaa veg v meter prati second main hogi
 Power is an ideal staple driver in the motor industries
 adhikansh mashine vidyut motaron dwaara hi chalaai jaati he
 The main reason for this is that the efficiency of electric motors is higher than other drivers
 saath hi uskaa nishpaadan bhi adhiktar unase acha hota he
 Electric motor is also ideal from the point of view of enforcement and control
 motor ko chalaanaa, athwa band karnaa, tathaa chaal ko badalanaa anya chaalkon kii apeksha adhik sugamawa se kiya ja saktaa he
 It can also have remote control
 niyantran kii sugamawa ke kaaran hi vidyut motor itane lokapriy ho gaye hai
 Electric motors can be used for many purposes
 ye kai sau ashwashakti kii badi badi mashine tathaa choti se choti, ashwashakti tak kii, mashine chalaa sakate hai
 Apart from industries, they are also used in agriculture for plowing fields, sowing and cutting machines and for running irrigation pumps
 gharon main prashithan, dhovan, tathaa anya vibhinn kaamon kii mashine bhi inase chalaai jaati hai
 Electric motors are made of different types for different purposes
 inamen saral niyantrak lage rahete hai, jinase anek prakaar kaa kaam liya ja saktaa he
 According to the supply, two types of motor have traditionally been counted as ham ynha sansofhan dekhnege-directhara motor and alternating current motor
 apane vibhyah galat haisirta lakshanon ke anusaar donon hi ke bahut se praroop hote he
 But over time this classification has weakened because Universal Motor A
C
 Can also run from shakti electraniki ke vikaas ne commutator ko ab motaron ke andar se baahar kar diya he
 The second classification of motors is done as synchronous and asynchronous
 yah kuch seemaa tak adhik tarkpurna vargeekaran he
 The rotor of synchronous machines rotates at the same angular speed as the magnetic field produced by the alternating current of that motor
 kintu iske vipareet acincronas motaron kaa roter kuch kam gati se chakkar karata he
 The induction motor is a prime example of this
 kuch pramukh motaren is prakaar hai: DC motors are more useful where speed control is very important
 aisa isaliye hai ki inkaa speed control bahut aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 It is actually a series DC motor that can be run from both AC and DC
 gharon main upyog main aane vaala mixr kaa motor universal motor hi hota he
 In addition to this, only the motor is used to pull the train engine, because its speed is very suitable for this work
 yah motor kam chaal par bahut adhik balaghurna paidaa karata he jabaki chaal badhane par iske dwaara utpann kiya gaya balaghurna kramshah kam hota jaataa he
 The most-common alternating current motor is the induction motor, which operates on the principle of induction
 yah motor sabase adhik upyog main aata he jiske kaaran ise udyogon kaa workehorse kehete hai
 There is no wear-resistant component so that it can last for many days without repair
 gharon main saamaanya kaaryon evam kam shakti ke liye prayukt adhikansh motaren ek-feji preran motor hi hotin hai inhen fracshnal horshpawar motor bhi kehete hai
 For example wings, motors for washing machines, etc
 prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi disht dhara motaron kii bhanti hi kshetrakundaliyaan tathaa armechar hote hai, parantu kuch vibhinn rup main
 They consist of two main parts: one is the stator, which remains fixed and the other rotates the rotor
 prayavarti dhara motaren bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai
 Three phage synchronous motors are of little use
 iskaa ek pramukh upyog shakti gunank ko acha banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It does not start by itself and some additional arrangements have to be made to start running
 kintu sincronas janitr yaa alternetr kaa bahut upyog hota he or duniya kaa adhikansh vidyut shakti altaranetaron ke dwaara hi paidaa kii ja rahi he
 The cost of this motor is not high
 inkaa upyog aajkal tej gati kii railgadiyon main ho rahaa he
 Nowadays they are used a lot for situation control and movement control
 inako aankik nikaayon kii sahaayta se control karnaa bahut aasaan kaary he; jaise ki kisi microcontrolar kii sahaayta se
 Shog motors are very suitable if movement is to be done in a wide range
 bahut se sthanon main disht dhara, shrenee motor kaa prachaalan lakshan vaanchhneeya hota he
 Efforts have also been made to arrange this in alternating current motors
 prayavarti dhara shrenee motor evam dikparivartak motor isi prakaar ke vishisht lakshanon kii vyavastha karte hai
 Synchronous motors can only operate at synchronous speed
 at: jahaan ekasmaanchaal kii aavashyaktaa ho, vahaan ye adarsh hote hai
 Just as direct current generator and motor are virtually the same machine and it is possible to use both in any form
 usee prakaar tulykaalik motor bhi, vastut:, prayavarti dhara janitr kaa, jise saamanyat: prayavartitra kehete hai, hi rup he or donon ko kisi bhi rup main prayog karnaa sambhav he
 Its operation requires both alternating current transmission in its stator and direct current exciter in the rotor
 in motaron kaa prayog kuch simit he
 Like repatriated for direct current stimulation, they also have a stimulant arranged like repatriated for an excitation
 in motaron kaa mukhya laabh yah he ki uttejnaa ko badhaane se shaktigunank bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, especially in industries where the power factor is greatly reduced due to having many induction motors, or due to some other reason, the power factor can be improved by arranging synchronous motors
 bahut se sthanon main to ye motor keval shaktigunank sudhaar ke liye hi prayukt kiye jate hai
 In such case they are called synchronous capacitors
 bahut se sthanon main keval ekakaleey sambharan hi uplabdh hota he
 Unilateral motors are used there
 choti mashiinon tathaa gharelu kaaryon ke liye ekakaleey preran motor bahut lokapriy hai
 Unitary motors are also used in electric wings
 isi prakaar dhavan mashiinon, prashitakon tathaa silaai kii mashiinon ityadi main ekakaleey motor hi pramukh kiye jate hai
 The main difficulty of single-phase motors lies in their starting
 aarambh karne ke liye kisi prakaar kaa kala vipatan aavashyak hota he
 Art splitting is usually done by an auxiliary coil, which has a capacitor placed in the aerapath, which displaces the current of the auxiliary coil about 10 electromagnets from the current of the main coil
 iske kaaran ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti sambhav ho sakati he or motor chalane lagata he
 Operating capacitance of the motor is also improved by having the capacitor in the circuit
 bahut se chote chote motor saarvatrik kism ke hote hai or disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara donon main hi prayukt kiye ja sakate hai
 In fact, these are class motors, which can be used both in direct current and reverse current
 vastut: ye shrenee motor hote hai, jinka prachaalan disht dhara ev prayavarti dhara donon main hi sambhav he, parantu ye atyant chote aakaaron main hi banaae ja sakate hai or keval kuch vishesh prayuktiyon main hi kaam aate hai
 Very small size motors are used in meters and other instruments and where an electric amount is to be measured
 duurastha niyantran, athwa valve ityadi ko kholane ke liye bhi, bahut se chote motor prayukt hote hai
 The upper cover of the motor is made according to different circumstances
 kuch motor khule hue praroop ke hote hai, jinamein unke andar ke bhaag saamne dikhaai padate hai, parantu aise motaron main dhul mitti jane kaa dar rahata he
 Therefore they cannot be used in open spaces
 parantu aise motaron main prakritik sanvathan acha hota he
 Therefore, they do not get heated quickly
 is kaaran aise motor aakaar ke anusaar saapekshatya adhik kshamta ke hote hai
 Where the motor has to operate in open spaces, there may be fear of dust, dirt etc
, so fully covered motors are used
 aise motaron main mukhya kathinaayee sanvathan kii hoti he
 Their casing is also made so that it can expand maximum heat
 saath hi usee isha par aropit ek pankhe kii bhi vyavastha hoti he, jo motor ke andar sanvathan vaayu ko pravesh kar sake or usamen utpann honevaali ooshmaa ko vistarit kar sake
 Semi-enclosed motors are satisfactory for most purposes, in which visible parts of the motor are covered by a lattice
 is prakaar inamen uparyukt donon prarupon ke laabh nihit rahete hai
 Special types of coverings are made for special conditions, such as completely flameless motors are used inside mines or in explosive environments
 isi prakaar kuch motor pani main neeche kaam karne ke liye banaae jate hai or unke aavaran kii rachana kaam karne ke liye banaae jate hai or unke aavaran kii rachana is prakaar hoti he ki pani motor ke andar na ja sake
 Different types of veils are made in many different circumstances
 bahut si motaron ko bhaar se sidhe hi sambhddha kar diya jaataa he or bahut si avasthaaon main unhen pattee, gear athwa chen dwaara sambhddha kiya jaataa he
 An almost constant speed ratio can be maintained from gears to driver and driven machines, and different moves can also be obtained by changing the gear order
 pattee dwaara shakti ke preshan main mashin ko motor se kaaphi dur bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he or ek saamaanya isha ko bhi chalaaya ja saktaa he, jisase duusari mashine sambhddha hon
 This is usually the case in large factories
 motaron kii kshamta ke liye mukhya parisima taap kii vruddhi he
 There is also the fear of damage due to the increase in heat, and the efficiency of the motor is also reduced due to increase in losses
 is prakaar motor anwarat prachaalan nahin kar saktaa
 Most motors are decelerated to a specific heat surge, which depends on the class of the insulator
 bahut se motor "santat kshamta" ke hote hai, jiskaa taatpary he ki vah nirdhaarit bhaar, bina taap ke vishisht seemaa tak bade, nirantar sambharan kar sakate hai
 Many motors operate at full load only for a short period of time and the rest of the time they are at low load or remain closed
 yadi prachaalankram nishchit ho, to aise prayojanon ke liye kam kshamta kii motor keval alp kaal ke liye hi purna bhaar par prachaalan karte hai or baaki samay bahut kam bhaar par rahete hai athwa band rahete hai
 If the operation is fixed, then low-capacity motors can be used for purposes whose operation and capacity are fixed for a short time

 The island is part of the Republic of China, with several islands surrounding it, headquartered on the island of Taiwan
 is kaaran praayah 'taiwan' kaa arth 'chini ganraajya' se bhi lagaaya jaataa he
 Although historically and culturally, it has been a part of the mainland, but there has been controversy in the administration of China and the Republic of China regarding its autonomy and independence
