 ve donon apana ksht apane tak hi simit rakhte hue jivan-yaapan kar rahe the tathaa kabhi kisi ke prati koi shikaayat nahin rakhte the
 He was always happy considering his poverty as his destiny and was satisfied with limited income
 sab kuch thik-thaak chal rahaa tha, magar jab bhaat kii beti vivaah yogya hui to bhaat kii patni ko uske vivaah kii chintaa sataane lagi
 She told her husband that what he brings from the ancestral profession is a comfortable daily expenditure, but nothing survives for the daughter's marriage
 beti ke vivaah main bahut kharch aata he, at: use koi or ytn karnaa hoga
 Bhat laughed on hearing this and said that the daughter has received him by the will of God, so God will find a way out for her marriage
 agar aisa nahin hota to har dampatti ko keval putr kii hi prapti hoti yaa koi dampati santanheen na rahete
 All happens by the will of God
 din bitate gaye, par bhaat ko beti ke vivaah main kharch laayak dhan nahin mil sakaa
 His wife is now unhappy
 bhaat se uskaa dukh nahin dekha gaya to vah ek din dhan ikattha karne kii niyat se nikal padaa
 He visited hundreds of states and entertained hundreds of royalty and big brothers and sang songs in praise of them
 khush hokar un logon ne jo puraskaar die usase beti ke vivaah laayak dhan ho gaya
 When he was returning with all the money, how could the thieves get a sense of his wealth on the way
 unhone sara dhan lut liya
 Now Bhat's faith will be on God and he will not have money for his daughter's marriage
 vah jab lautakar ghar aayaa to uski patni ko aashaa thi ki vah byaah ke liye uchit dhan laayaa hoga
 He told Bhat's wife that on his repeated request, he went to many states to earn money for marriage and met people in various ways
 logon se paryaapt dhan bhi ekatra kar laayaa par bhagwaan ko us dhan se uski beti kaa vivaah hona manjuur nahin tha
 On the way, the robbers looted all the money and somehow he has returned after saving his life
 bhaat kii patni gahari chintaa main dub gai
 She asked the husband how the daughter will get married now
 bhaat ne phir apni baat duharai ki jisane beti di he vahi ishwar uske vivaah kii vyavastha bhi kar degaa
 At this, his wife said with disappointment that God feels that the Maharaja will send Vikram to arrange the marriage
 jab yah vaartalap ho rahaa tha tabhi maharaj uske ghar ke paas se guzar rahe the
 He laughed at Bhat's wife's remarks
 duusari taraf brahman apni aajeevika ke liye pushtaini pesha apanaakar jaise-taise guzar-basar kar rahaa tha
 He was happily doing whatever he received in the form of Dakshina by getting him worshiped
 brahmani ko bhi tab tak sab kuch saamaanya dikh padaa jab tak ki unki beti vivaah yogya nahin hui
 When the daughter's marriage started worrying, she asked the Brahmin to deposit some money
 magar brahman chaahakar bhi nahin kar paaya
 On being reminded of his wife again and again he turned around his judges and said, but no judge took his words seriously
 ek din brahmani tang aakar boli ki vivaah kharch maharaja vikramaditya se mangakar dekho, kyonki ab or koi vikalp nahin he
 You have to donate it
 brahman ne kaha ki vah maharaj ke paas zaroor jayega
 If the Maharaj donates money, then all arrangements will be made
 uski bhi patni ke saath puri baatcheet vikram ne sun lee, kyonki usee samay ve uske ghar ke paas guzar rahe the
 In the morning he sent the soldiers and summoned both Bhat and Brahmin to the court
 vikramaditya ne apane haathon se bhaat ko das lakh swarna mudraayen daan kii
 Then got the Brahmin a few hundred currencies from the treasury
 ve donon ati prasann ho vahaan se vidaa ho gaye
 When they left, a courtier asked the king's permission to say something
 usne jigyaasa kii ki bhaat or brahman donon kanya daan ke liye dhan chaahate the to maharaj ne pakshpaat kyon kiya
 Why gave one million gold to Bhat and only a few hundred gold currencies to Brahmin
 vikram ne jawaab diya ki bhaat dhan ke liye unke aasare par nahin baitha tha
 He was sitting looking forward to God
 ishwar logon ko kuch bhi de sakate hai, isliye unhone use ishwar kaa pratinidhi banakar apratyaashit daan diya, jabaki brahman kuleen vansh kaa hote hue bhi ishwar main puri aasthaa nahin rakhata tha
 He expected help from them
 raja bhi aakhir manushya he, ishwar kaa sthaan nahin le saktaa
 They gave him as much money as the marriage would be well done

 Director Peter Jackson first came into contact with The Lord of the Rings when he saw the 1978 film Ralph Bakshi
 jackson ko kaaphi "acchhee lagi or ve chaahate the ki uske bare main adhik jane
" baad main, unhone wellington se oakland kii baarah ghante kii rail yatra ke dauraan hi us kitaab ke taai-in sanskaran ko padhaa
 In 1995, Jackson was finishing The Friturners and was thinking of creating The Lord of the Rings as a new project, and was quite surprised at the "why no one is doing anything on it" computer-generated After making a new development in that episode after the fictional picture Jurassic Park, Jackson planned to make a fictional film that seemed relatively serious and real
 By October, he and his partner Franwalsh, along with Miramax Films owner Harvey Weinstein, had a conversation with Saul Zentz, who had owned the book since the 1970s, and two films based on The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
 Emphasized
 1997 main jab universal ne king kong ko radd kar diya, tab jackson or walsh ko fouran vinstin kaa samarthan mila or adhikaron kii chantai ke liye ek chah hafte kii prakriya shuru hui
 jackson or walsh ne costa botes se pustak kaa sankshep main saar likhane ko kaha or inhone kitaab ko phir se padhanaa shuru kiya
 Two to three months later, he wrote his version
 The topic discussed in the first film would later become The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
 It ends with Saruman's death and Gandalf and Pippin Minas leave for Tirith
 In this presentation, Saruman's escape follows testimonyer and Gandalf's journey to Adores, and when Gollum attacks Frodo, during the time of the Fellowship's unification, and in the presence of Farmer Megot, Glorfindel, Radagast, Alladen, and Elrohir
 bilbo elrond kii council main upasthit hota he, sam galadrial ke aaine main dekhtaa he, saruman mrityu se pehle praayshchit karata he or unke girane se pehle najgul parvat kaa vinaash karata he
 He presented his version to Harvey and Bob Weinstein and focused on his screenplay, putting Bob in the center as he had not read the book
 75 karod dollar ke kul bajet par do filmon ke liye unhone apni sahmati vyakt kii
 Jackson and Walsh Stephen began writing with Sinclair during the middle of 1997
 sinclayr kaa partner philip boyens kitaab kaa ek bada prashansak tha or unke varnan ko padhane ke baad unke lekhan team main shaamil hua
 The script for the two films took 13–14 months to write, which were 147 and 144 pages respectively
 natya sambandhi dayitvon ke kaaran sinclayr ko pariyojna ko chhodana padaa
 unke sanshodhan main, sam ko dusron kii baat chhipakar sunne ke chalate use frodo ke saath jane ko majboor kiya gaya or sam kii jagah mairi or pipin ne us ring ke bare main pataa lagaaya or frodo se inkaa saamana hone ke baad swechhapurvak uske saath chale jate hai or yah rup mul upanyaas main paaya jaataa he

 Other changes include Arwen defending Frodo and a link to the action in Cave Troll
 yahaan tak kii arven kaa wich-king ko maarane janaa bhi
 The problem arose when Marty Katz was sent to New Zealand
 vahaan chaar maheene bitaane ke baad usne miramax se kahaaki in filmon main or kareeb 150 karod dollar kii laagat he or miramax ke saath vitt karne main asamarth he or kareeb 15 karod dollar pehle hi kharch ho jane ke chalate unhone do filmon ko ek main hi vilay karne kaa faisla kiya
 On June 17, 1998, Bob Weinstein presented the book adaptation of a two-hour film experiment
 unhone bri or hemsdip ke yuddh ko hataane kaa suzav diya, saruman ko "rakhane yaa hataane" kaa, boromir kii bahan ke rup main rohan or gondor ko iovin ko pratisthapit karnaa, revandale or moriya ko chota karnaa, saath hi saath uruk hai dwaara mairi or pipin ke apharan ko ants ke dwaara rokna

 Jackson went to Hollywood for about four weeks to show a thirty-five-minute video of his work before the New Line Cinema meeting with Mark Ordesky
 nai line cinema par robert shaye ne video ko dekha or poochhaaki aakhir kyon ve do film bana rahe hai jabaki kitaab teen sanskarnon ke rup main prakashit he, ve film triology bananaa chaahate the
 Due to which Jackson, Walsh and Boynes now had to write three new scripts
 teen filmon main vistaar ke liye rachanaatmak swatantraaa to zyada thi, lekin walsh, jackson or boyens ko apni script ke mutabik unka punargathan karnaa tha
 The three films do not correspond exactly to the three editions of the triology, but represent a transformation of the three parts

 The most notable character in these rewrites was Arwen, who was originally planned as a warrior princess, but in the book her appearance is repatriated and physically inactive in the story
 film nirmaan kaa sabase vyapak adhyayan da frodo franchise he jise film itihaaskaar christin thomson dwaara banaaya gaya
 The filmmakers hired Hollywood-recognized sword guru Bob Anderson to develop choreography of war and sword in this triology

 pandit chaturvedi ke sampurna krititv kaa prakaashan "hrishikesh rachanawali " naam se pustak ke rup main hua
 Chaturvedi ji was associated with the rituals of the traditional god Vandana
 ve us sanskaar se apane kavita-kaal ke udai se ant tak jude rahe
 Since 1928, he was associated with miraculous art-side poetry
 is kshetra main ve itnaa aage bade ki aise lekhan vaale kisi bhi kavi ko unhone peeche chhod diya - saras chitrakavy, vilom kavy ," shriramkrishnakavy ", yamak shlesh yukt saras prabandh kavy "shriramkrishnayan " tathaa anek chamatkaarpurn padya panktiyaan likhin
 In 1936, however, there was a buzz of hallucinations in Hindi and Omar Khayyam's path to openness started to be realized, then Chaturvedi ji justified the cannabis hangover suited to Indian culture
 bhaang or bhangdi par unhone 101 rubaayiyaan " vijay vatika " pustak main likhi jo shuddh hasya kii rachana he The fourth step of Chaturvedi ji's poem is the comic book

 Assets are classified as living, non-living, cultural or economic
 khataron ko prakritik yaa maanav-nirmit kaarnon ke dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 The entire strategic management process is divided into four areas for the purpose of identifying processes
 ye chaar kshetra saamaanya rup se jokhim newnikaran, khatre kaa saamana karne ke liye sansadhano ko taiyaar karne, khatre kii vajah se hue vaastavik nuksaan kaa uttar dene or aage ke nuksaan ko simit karne or yathasambhav khatre kii ghatana se yathapurv sthiti main lautne se sambandhit hai
 The field is both public and private, the process is common but the focus centers are different
 apatkaaleen prabandhan prakriya ek nitigat prakriya na hokar ek ranneetik prakriya he atah yah aamtaur par sanghathan main kaaryakari str tak hi simit rahati he
 In general, it has no direct power but serves as a consultant or to coordinate tasks to ensure that all parts of an organization focus on a common goal

 The most senior person in the organization conducting the program is usually said to be based on an emergency manager or derived from a term used in the field
 is paribhaasha ke antargat shaamil kshetra hai: The nature of management depends on local economic and social status
 fred kani jaise kuch aapadaa raahat visheshgyon ne ullekh kiya he ki ek tarah se ekmaatr asli aapadaa aarthik hoti he
 Experts such as Kani noted long ago that the emergency management cycle should include long-term work on infrastructure, public awareness, and even human justice issues
 apatkaaleen prabandhan kii prakriya ke chaar charan hai: newnikaran, tatparta, pratikriya or ubarna

 Definitions of the two terms are not simply appropriate as separate steps
 paribhaasha ke anusaar rokthaam 100% shaman he
 The recovery describes the goal of four steps: the ability to overcome misfortune easily or to adjust to change khataron ko aapadaaon main puri tarah viksit hone se rokane yaa ghatit hone kii sthiti main aapadaaon ke prabhaav ko kam karne kaa prayaas newnikaran karrwai he

 samudaay or buniyadi dhaanche main aapadaa purv nihit jokhim ko kam karne ke uddeshy se "waapas behatar banane" ke prayaas kiye jane chahie
 Leveraging 'short-term opportunities' for the implementation of otherwise unpopular reduction measures is an important aspect of effective recovery efforts
