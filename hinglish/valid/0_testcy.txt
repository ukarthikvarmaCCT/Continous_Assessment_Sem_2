 ek baar oji ne mujhase poocha, tum mujhase kitna pyaar karti ho? or maine tab kaha tha main tumhaare liye kuch bhi kar sakati hum, main vaaki main tumhen chaahati hum or main tumhaare liye apni jaan bhi de sakati hum
 Sharon said, "then i was ready to show how much i love her and i can even die for her
" phir main room sarvice teble ke paas gai, vahaan ek chaaku padaa tha
 i took the knife in my hand and said, 'I love you very much
 
 
 yah kah kar maine apni kalai kaat lee thi
 ' doklam kaa tanaav bharat-china seemaa par har jagah dikh rahaa he, isiilie sena kii taiyaari sirf sikkim main hi nahin balki laddhakh ke barfile ilaakon main bhi he
 Aajtak's team reached the last village near the Chinese border in Ladakh
 1962 main jab bharat par china ne hamalaa bolaa tha, tab isi ladakh ko bhi apana kshetra bataanaa shuru kiya
 Then India had nothing in this area
 lekin aaj bharat itnaa satark ho gaya he ki usne ladakh main sari taiyaariyaan kar lee he
 China has always been constructing in its area, India stops if it does, but now India is working on these roads, building in its territory
 1962 ke yuddh main china ne aksai china kaa ek bada hissaa kabja kar liya tha
 The hangover of the 1962 war on Chinese soldiers has not landed today
 lekin hamaari sena kii taiyaari bataati he ki ab agar china ne ankhen tareri to uske liye bure din shuru ho jaaenge
 People living here are not afraid of China today because they are sure of their jawans
 ladakh bharat ke liye nirnaayak he
 But there is no electricity to the last village on the border, there is a need to work for those basic needs
 china ek taraf sikkim ke pasdokalamame apni dadaageeri dikhaa rahaa he to laddhakh par uski laalchee najar se bharat waakif he
 Ladakh's importance to India is also enhanced by the fact that China is creating a special economy zone in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir next to it, that is, Ladakh can surround China from three sides
 pakistan main china kaa badhata dakhal pakistan kii samoochee arthvyavastha ke china ke haathon main girvee hone kaa sanket de rahaa he
 If we examine the Special Economic Zone of China - Mokpondas SEZ in gilgit-baltistan - Mohammed Marble City in Khyber Pakhtunwa - Bhimbar Industrial Zone in pok - Punjab in the Sheikhpura of Punjab - China SEZ in Dhabji of Singh - Nowshera of Khyber Pakhtunwa The Rasakai Economic Zone is forming
 itnaa hi nahin china ke kashgar se guadar tak ke bich main pakistan ke liye nau power project ko bhi china taiyaar kar rahaa he
 It is clear that the risk of this preparation of China in Pakistan increases for India
 pakistani kabje vaale kashmir main china kii maujuudagi kaa matlab hua ki wo bharat kii jameen par apana daawa kar rahaa he or pioke main chini sena kii maujuudagi hameshaa bharat ke liye bada khatra bana rahegaa
 In the midst of all this, Pakistan's High Commissioner to India Abdul Bashit meeting with the Ambassador of China and Bhutan tells that Pakistan is also jumping in the tensions between India and China
 saaf he ki china pakistan main apni entry or ladakh par najar rakhkar ek manovaigyanik yuddh bhi lard rahaa he

 Would never had been reason not to be there asadha maheene kii dwitiya tithi ko bhagwaan jagannatha kii rathyatra kaa utsav manaaya jaataa he
 The 141st Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath has started in Ahmedabad from today i
e
 14th July
 ahmedabad main rathyatra kaa shubharambh bhagwaan jagannatha ke mukhya mandir se shuru hua he, jiske baad ye rathyatra saraspur ke ranchhoddas mandir tak jaaegi
 Apart from this, Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra has started in Puri, Odisha
 is yatra main bhagwaan jagannatha ko saal main ek baar unke garbh grih se nikaalkar yatra karai jaati he
 Lord Krishna, his brother Balarama and sister Subhadra are also seated in the chariot along with Lord Jagannath
 ye utsav puure 9 dinon tak manaaya jaataa he
 The belief behind the journey is that God comes out of his womb and sees the happiness and misery of the people themselves
 orissa kii puri jagannatha yatra kaa mahatvaodisha ke puri kii rathyatra sabase zyada prasiddh he
 In the Puranas, Jagannath Puri has been called the Baikuntha of the earth
 brahm or skanda puraana ke anusaar, puri main bhagwaan vishnu ne purushottam nilmadhav ke rup main avatar liya tha
 He became the supreme deity of the Sabar tribe here
 sabar janajati ke devtaa hone kii vajah se yahaan bhagwaan jagannatha kaa rup kabeelai devataaon kii tarah he
 The Mahima of Jagannath temple in Odisha is famous not only in the country but also in the world
 13 taarikh or shuukravaar ko kyon mana jaataa he ashubh, jaaniye vajahaye he bhagwaan jagannatha or unki rathyatra kaa rahasyabhagwan jagannatha kii rathyatra ke liye balram, shrikrishna or devi subhadra ke liye teen alag-alag rath nirmit kiye jate hai
 At the forefront of the rath yatra is the chariot of Balramji, followed by the chariot of Goddess Subhadra in the middle and the chariot of Lord Jagannath Sri Krishna at the back
 ise unke rang or oonchai se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The Jagannath temple built in Puri is one of the four dhams of Hindus in India
 yah dham takarabin 800 saalon se bhi zyada purana mana jaataa he
 Nandigosh Rath of Lord Jagannath 45
 6 feet ooncha, balraamji kaa taldhvaj rath 45 feet ooncha or devi subhadra kaa darpadalan rath 44
 It is 6 feet high
 jagannatha puri mandir se judi kuch aisi chamatkaari baaten hai jo sabhi ko aashcharyachakit kar detii hai-- jagannatha mandir ke shikhar par sthit jhanda hameshaa hawa kii vipareet disha main laharaata he
 - There is also a Sudarshan Chakra on the summit of the temple
 is chakra ko kisi bhi disha se khadey hokar dekhne par aisa lagata he ki chakra kaa munh aapaki taraf he
 Shiva Puja on monthly Shivaratri according to the zodiac- In the kitchen of the temple, 7 utensils are placed on top of each other to cook prasad
 yah prasad mitti ke bartanon main lakdi par hi pakaaya jaataa he
 During this time, the dish of the utensil placed at the top is cooked first and then the prasad is cooked one after the other from the bottom
 - mandir ke singhdwar se pehla kadam andar rakhane par hi aap samudr kii laharon se aane vaali aawaaj ko nahin sun sakate
 The surprising thing is that as soon as you step out of the temple, the sound of the sea starts to be heard
 yah anubhav shaam ke samay or bhi alokik lagata he
 - We have seen birds sitting and flying on the summit of most temples
 jagannatha mandir kii yah baat aapako chaunkaa degi ki iske upar se koi pakshi nahin gujarata
 Even the airplane does not leave the temple
 - mandir main har din banane vaala prasad bhakton ke liye kabhi kam nahin padataa saath hi mandir ke pat band hote hi prasad bhi khatm ho jaataa he
 - The shadow of the main peak of Jagannath temple is not formed at any time of the day
 - ek pujari mandir ke 45 manjila shikhar par sthit jhande ko roj badalata he
 It is believed that if the flag is not changed on a single day, the temple will be closed for 18 years
 - aamtaur par din main chalane vaali hawa samudr se dharti kii taraf chalati or shaam ko dharti se samudr kii taraf
 The surprising thing is that this process is vomiting in Puri

 After the violence at the pro-patel reservation rally in Ahmedabad on August 25, 2015, when sedition cases were filed against Hardik, Patel became his poster boy by gathering him behind him
 na to jail main bitaye aath maheene or na hi aath maheenon ke liye gujarat se baahar nikaalnaa unhen todgaye main kaamyaab ho sakaa
 Their fight is not over yet
 hardik kaa kahana he ki unhone congress ko samarthan isliye diya taaki ve bhaajapa ke ahankaar ko tod saken or 2015 kii police golibari main 14 patelon kii maut kaa badla le saken
 He had said that the Patel movement had nothing to do with political parties, he did so just to gain reservation
 unhone kaha ki gujarat ke nateezon ke baad bhi uskaa andolan jari rahegaa
 Hardik's relentless campaign against the BJP did not affect the Patels in central and south Gujarat
 uttar gujarat main bhi unako dekhne ke liye jo baari bheed jutati thi, usne bhi vipaksh kii jholii andhadhundh voton se nahin bhari
 In Saurashtra, however, he forced the BJP to lose 12 seats and made a dent in its total seats
 lagata he, patelon ke masale par bhaajapa kii mushkilen abhi kaayam rahengi
 So, if the party has to overcome its destiny in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it is very important for it to pour water on the fire of this movement
 hardik aarakshan ke masale par khud ko saadhane kii party kii koshishon ko thukraa chuke hai—bhaajapa ne aarthik taur par pichde virgon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa vidheyak paarit kiya he, jise aarakshan par supreme court kii 49 fisadi kii upree seemaa kii roshni main gujarat hycourt main chunauti di gai he
 Hardik rejected bjp's move, saying Patel only wanted reservation under the OBC quota
 haalanki unhone gujarat chunaavon kii purvasandhya par isi ke badale hue rup main congress kii taraf se kii gai peshkash sweekaar kar lee
 It was clear that Hardik had taken the lead in ensuring the defeat of the BJP
 apane makasad main to ve naakaam rahe, par unhone bhagava party ko buree tarah jhakzor diya he
 Political pundits are in a fix as to whether the Patel movement will gain the same momentum after the election, especially given that it has failed to oust the BJP from power
 phir bhi andolan ne hardik ko ek manch muhaiyaa kara diya he
 He is still under age to take formal steps in politics and will be able to get the Legislative Assembly seat only next July
 siyaasi uthalputhal machaane vaale uske saathi alpesh thakor or jignesh mewaani vidhayak ban chuke hai
 Alpesh is a Congress MLA and Jignesh is an Independent MLA with the support of Congress
 2022 main agle chunaav tak, jab ve chunaav ladgaye kii paatrata hasil karenge, siyaasi maidan main khud ko tikaae rakh paanaa hardik ke liye mushkil sabit ho saktaa he
 In these elections, he requested the people of his community to vote against the BJP to avenge the death of 14 Patels killed in the 2015 police firing
 magar badla aisi cheez he jo aap do baar nahin le sakate
 Of course, seeing his journey so far, Hardik can also do something unexpected
 jis congress party se patelon ne beete do dashakon se duuri banaae rakhi thi, usee congress ke saath uskaa judsa abhi kuchhek or saal jari rah saktaa he
 Currently, the spectacle of the 2017 Gujarat elections has fallen
 magar jab tak vah drishy par he, hardik bhaajapa ke liye chintaa kaa sabab bane rahenge

 bharat ne china se kaha kashmir or ladakh hamaara aantarik maamalasrilanka ne bharat ke faisle kaa kiya swaagatbharat ko mila yuai kaa sathjammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 It was simply said
 anuchhed 370 ke kuch praavdhaanon ko khatm karke jammu-kashmir ko mili vishesh darje ke khatme ke saath ab kashmir bhi saamaanya centre shasit pradeshon kii tarah ho jayega
 Monday was a historic day for India
 bharat ne jammu-kashmir punargathan adhinium ke prastaav ko sansad main rakhkar itihaas rach diya
 India made it clear by gestures that Kashmir is not an 'issue' for us, every decision taken on Kashmir is an internal decision of India, in which the intervention of any international community is not acceptable
 keval kuch hi desh aise hai jinhone anuchhed 370 ko hataane par bharat ke viruddh kuch kaha ho
 But some have concerns about why some leaders active in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir have been arrested
 america kii kashmir par najalmerica videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa morgan ortags ne kaha ki ham bahut baariki se jammu-kashmir main hone vaali har gatividhi par najar rakh rahe hai
 We have taken cognizance of that declaration of India, through which they have changed the status quo of Jammu and Kashmir in their constitution
 america videsh mantralay kaa yah bayaan aise vakt main aayaa he jab america bharat or kashmir ke bich chal rahe mudde ko sulajhane main apni dilchaspee dikhaai he
 US President Donald Trump has said that if India wishes, the US will help resolve the ongoing Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan
 morgan ortags ne yah bhi kaha ki hamen chintaa he ki vahaan (kashmir) main kuch logon kii giraftaaryaan hui hai
 We should respect individual rights
 un logon ko khaastaur par jinke adhikaron par sankat he
 We appeal to all sides to maintain peace on the Line of Control
 sanyukt raashtra kii apil, seemaa par baraten sanyamjammu-kashmir ke do purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla or mahabuuba mufti ravivaar raat se hi najarband the
 He was arrested on Monday
 pipuls conference ke chairman or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke sahyogi sajaad lone, imran ansaari ko bhi somvaar ko hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 The United Nations has appealed to India and Pakistan to both exercise restraint along the border
 sanyukt raashtra ke pravaktaa stephen dujaarik ne kaha duniya kii najar kashmir main hone vaali har gatividhi par he
 We are watching the tension rising in that area
 ham bharat or pakistan se sanyam baratane kii apil kar rahe hai
 in support of India The country whose most meaningful response came after the separation of Ladakh region from Jammu and Kashmir
 srilanka ke pradhanmantri ranil vikramsanghe ne twit kar kaha ki jammu-kashmir se ladakh ke alag hone kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 70 percent of Ladakh's population belongs to Buddhism
 aise main ladakh pehla bhartiya rajya hoga, jahaan buddha bahumat he
 The reorganization of Ladakh is an internal matter of India
 yah ek sundar kshetra he, jo yatra ke laayak he
 Strong opposition to the OIC The Islamic Cooperation Organization (OIC) liaison group on Jammu and Kashmir has condemned India's decision to withdraw Article 370 and divide the state into two union territories
 islamic sanghathanon kii aalochana apratyaashit nahin he
 Pakistan is an Islamic country, so their reaction did not seem to be anticipated from anywhere
 lekin yah bharat kii kootneeti hi he jisaki vajah se islamic sanghathanon ke sabase damdaar desh united arab emirate (yuai) ne kashmir par bharat sarkaar ke pahal kaa swaagat kiya he
 In support of the removal of Article 370 from UAE Jammu and Kashmir, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) described India's internal matter
 unhone kaha ki yuai ne bharat sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ke do praavdhaanon ko hataaya he, jis par yuai ne sangyaan liya he
 UAE Ambassador to India Dr
 ahamed al banna ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 ke alaava hamane jammu-kashmir punargathan bill par bhi sangyaan liya he, jisase ladakh or jammu-kashmir do centre shasit pradesh ban jaaenge
 He also said that the reorganization of states is not a strange phenomenon in the history of independent India
 iskaa makasad kshetreey asamanta ko kam karnaa or dakshata main sudhaar laana he
 He believes that the decision taken by the Narendra Modi government regarding Jammu and Kashmir is an internal issue, as laid down by the Indian Constitution
 bharat ne di har desh ko suchnabharat ke videsh sachiv or videsh mantralay ke adhikari bharat main rah rahe videshi rajdooton ko yah samajha rahe hai ki kashmir par liya gaya bharat kaa nirnay, aantarik mudda he
 Indian Ambassador to Russia Bala Venkatesh Verma said on Tuesday that i was in the Foreign Ministry this morning
 maine roosi videsh mantralay main apane sahyogiyon ko bharat ke nirnay ke sambandh main soochna de di he
 We will keep our close friends fully informed about Kashmir
 china ko sata rahi kashmir kii chintadusare deshon kii seemaa main dakhal dene vaale china ke videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua chuning ne kashmir kii sthiti par ‘chintaa’ jataai he
 Hua Chuning said that China is worried about the current situation in Kashmir
 kashmir mudde ko lekar china kii sthiti saaf or satat he
 This issue is a legacy of history between India and Pakistan, which is looked after by the international community
 hua chuning ne kaha ki sambandhit pakshon ko sanyam baratna chahie
 Work should be done cautiously, especially avoiding actions that unilaterally change the status quo and increase stress
 china ne ladakh ko bharat kaa centre shasit kshetra bataane par bhi aapatti jataate hue kaha he ki donon deshon ke bich vivaadit kshetra hai jo ki china kii kshetreey akhandta or samprabhutaa ko prabhavit karte hai
 New Delhi, in response to this, made it clear that India is committed to resolve the 'boundary issue' peacefully among themselves
 bharat kaa china ko javabajammu-kashmir ke mudde par china kii tippanee par videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha he ki jammu-kashmir punargathan bill 2019 bharat ke kshetra se judaa ek aantarik maamla he
 India does not comment on the internal affairs of other countries
 isi tarah anya deshon se bhi ummid karata he ki ve bharat ke aantarik maamalon par hastkshep na karen
 Spokesperson Ravish Kumar said that as far as the indo-china border is concerned, both sides have agreed to a fair and reciprocal settlement based on political parameters and guiding principles for settlement of the border issue
 aise main bharat ne saaf kar diya he ki kisi bhi desh ke bahya hastkshep ko bharat apane aantarik maamalon main nahin sahegaa
 India's decision is clear for its sovereignty, which has no place to interfere with any international organizations
 Yes it's sabotage, our security agency and admin who are handling the crowd well

 Therefore, one should not say Hinduism

 The people living in India are Hindus

 In a letter written by the All India Guest Teachers Association, it has been said that for the last eight years, guest teachers have been serving in schools
 shikshakon ne apane jivan kaa bahumoolya samay or yogadan dilli ke sarkari skulon kii shiksha vyavastha ko sudhaarney or baccho ke bhavishya ko sanvaarane main diya he
 Despite this, his future is still in darkness
 ol india guest teachers association ke sadsy shoeb rana kaa kahana he ki ab ek baar phir se kaarykaal khatm hone ke chalate 22000 parivaar sadak par aane or berozegaar hone kii kagaar par he
 Guest teachers are afraid of leaving their jobs every day
 unhen berozegaar hone kii chintaa sataati rahati he
 Thousands of families are completely dependent on this job

 The cabinet of Education Minister had passed the provisions in the cabinet regarding serving 60 years to guest teachers and sent them to the Lieutenant Governor, which has not been processed yet
 aisa prathit hota he ki wo cabinet note bhi ab thande baste main chalaa gaya he jisase sabhi atithi shikshak chintit hai
 If a 60-year policy is not made for guest teachers on the basis of that cabinet note, then guest teachers will remain under the shadow of fear
 aapse ummid he ki aap is maamle ko sangyaan main lekar is par twarit kaarywahi karne kii krupa karen
 Bringing the bill for regularization The Education Minister has demanded that on 04 October 2017, a bill for regularization of guest teachers and teachers under SSA in the Legislative Assembly, Regulation Bill for services of guest teachers and teachers working under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
 2017 (bill No
 (7) 2017) came
 ise dhvanimat ke saath vidhaan sabha me paas karke uparajyapal ke paas uparokt bill ko paas karne ke liye bheja gaya tha
 Unfortunately even after 2 years no action has been taken on that bill yet
 ab wo bill thande baste main chalaa gaya he
 Even after that the Delhi government has passed many different types of bills from LG Saheb like Bill of Mohalla clinics but your government did not give any special consideration to pass it on the above bill, due to which, even after two years has passed
 If the above bill is passed, no action could be seen going forward

 bataa den ki atithi shikshakon kii selary pichhali baar 03 march 2017 ko badi thi, uske baad teen saal se koi badhottaree nahin kii gai
 The Supreme Court has also passed orders in various cases to give equal pay for equal work to those working on contracted / daily wages but it is unfortunate that the people of the most respected profession of the society still have to work on daily wages
 Is falling unako sarkari chuttee tak ke paise nahi milte hai
 Their monthly salary is not fixed
 na unhen koi cajual live CL di jaati he, na anya bhatte dene kaa praavdhaan he
 At the same time, SSA teachers working in the same department are given fixed monthly salary
