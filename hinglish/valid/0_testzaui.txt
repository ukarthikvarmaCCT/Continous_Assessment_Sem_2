 The ICC recently implemented its current rating system for results since 1952, indicating Australia's historic dominance in Test cricket with the most consecutive rank months ahead of providing ratings for the end of each month back to 1952 April

 haalanki, test championships ko radd kar diya gaya tha ke rup main isisi ne kaha he ki vah apane prasaaran ke saathi dwaara samarthit nahin tha - iespien star sports

 Each time the two teams complete another series, described as below the ranking table, the teams' ratings are updated on the basis they played just before
 prayek team barabari ke liye reating ank: a team earns 1 series point as each match won and their opponent 0, losing among them earns 0 series points and their opponent 1, and drawing both teams earns half a series point, therefore teams as each match played type Earns rating points: is sutara hi lagu hota he jab shrunkhlaa ke shuru main do tiimon kii reating ke bich antar ko kam se kam 40 ank tha, ek match jeetne hameshaa reating ve pehle se hi tha kii tulana main ek team adhik reating ank arjeet karenge, or ek match haarane hoga hameshaa reating ve pehle se hi tha kii tulana main ek team main kam reating ank kamaate hai
 a match attracted weak team ratings they already had, and strong teams would earn the least rating points
 jeet or ek bhi match haarane ke bich kaa antar isliye 100 ank he
 In addition, the result of a match results in a win and a loss or a draw, regardless of the total rating that the points earned by both teams from the match will be the sum of the two teams' ratings before the series began
 kul reating ek shrunkhlaa se arjeet ank isliye donon tiimon ke 'reating ke yoga ke baraabar se pehle shrunkhlaa ke dwaara guna shuru kiya jayega
 The rating is equal to the strong team for points: or kamjor team ke liye reating ank ke baraabar hoti he: Each match played therefore earns teams rating points as above, as follows: isliye, phir se, ek match jeetne hameshaa ek team adhik reating ank reating ve pehle se hi tha kii tulana main arjeet karenge, or ek match haarane hameshaa reating ve pehle se hi tha kii tulana main ek team main kam reating ank arjeet karenge
 The weaker team ratings they had already attracted a match, the stronger the team would earn the least points
 donon tiimon ke liye, jeet or ek bhi match haarane ke bich ke antar ko abhi bhi 100 ank he
 In addition, whichever of the three results occurs, the overall rating is that the points earned by both teams from the match will start the series before the sum of the two teams' ratings
 prayek team ke liye: The two teams, initially with ratings of 120 and 90, are a 3-match series, and with a higher starting rating, the team playing 2–2 wins: atikaay ramayana kaa ek paatr he

 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya
 Brother Bannon then copied the same and mixed the compositions of some other people which were not approved, but also the works of some others, Govind Singh prepared a third 'beed' in which, along with the works of the ninth Guru, himself
 One of his 'saloks' was also ranked
 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added
 'granth' kii pratham paanch rachanaayen kramash: 'japunisanu', 'sodaru' mahala1, 'sunibada' mahala1, 'so purakhu', mahala 4 tathaa sohila mahala ke naamon se prasiddh hai or inke ananthar 'sirirag' aadi 31 raagon main vibhakt pad aate hai jinamein pehle sikhaguruon kii rachanaayen unke anusaar sangruhit hai
 The positions of the Bhagats have been kept in their interiors, but somewhere in between, 'barhamasa', 'thinti', 'dinraini', 'ghodiyaan', 'siddha Gosthi', 'karhale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' etc
 Certain small and big specific compositions have also been added, which illustrate the poetic nature of ordinary folk songs
 un raganusaar krambaddh padon ke ananthar salok sahas kriti, 'gaatha' mahala 5, 'phunhe' mahala 5, chaubolen mahala 5, savaie simukh vaak mahala 5 or mudaavni mahala 5 ko sthaan mila he or sabhi ke ant main ek ragamala bhi de di gai he
 Even in the midst of these works, if 'salok' of Kabir and Sheikh Farid is stored, then elsewhere there are those eulogies created by 11 posts which are said to be in praise of Sikh Gurus and whose number is not even less
 'granth' main sangruhit rachanaayen bhashavavidhya ke kaaran kuch vibhinn lagati hui bhi, adhiktar saamanjasy evam ekarupata ke hi udhaaharan prastut karti hai
 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru

 Suitable times for specific small major compositions such as morning, evening, bedtime are certain and although the subjects of major collected works seem to be mainly related to philosophical principles, spiritual practice and praise, there is no doubt that 'etc

 aadhunik yug main pratham vishwayuddh ke baad kisi ek vyakti yaa varg ke swaarth ke liye vidhaan kaa ulanghan ekadhinaayakatv kaa pramukh lakshan ho gaya
 In addition to exhausting the mind of the general public, war created a tendency to obey in all social areas by imposing military discipline in place of restraint
 sainya uddeshyon ke liye aavashyak satta ke kendrikaran ne logon ko is baat ke liye abhyast bana diya ki ve saamaajik samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye aisi nirankush satta ke nirnay maan len jo kisi ke prati uttaradaayi na ho
 In this situation, the democratic system seemed to disintegrate
 falat: yuddh se sarvaadhik prabhavit deshon main saamanyat: log aise 'louhpurush' ke swaagat ke liye tatpar the jo apane shaury, aatmavishvaas or katibaddhta ke bal par unka mat liye bina raashtra ke naam par apni ichha tathaa aadesh se samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar de
 Therefore, for the people, generally, a monknayak became a hard working person who himself could become a national emblem with a mystical charm to awaken a sense of respect for himself and make people feel great on the basis that they are related to him
 ekadhinaayakatv kii pratham visheshta uske udgam main hai
 It is never established in any country and era by means which are considered legitimate in that country and era
 uske liye yah aavashyak he ki uski neenv vidhaan ke ulanghan par ho, yadhyapi uskaa astitv kisi vidhaan ke na maanane par ashrith nahin he
 Every monolithic element begins with an uprising and then for some reason, it can maintain its revolutionary form
 parantu uskaa uddeshy puraane vidhaan ke sthaan par nae vidhaan kii sthapana bhi ho saktaa he kyonki ekadhinaayakatv puraatan, jeern vyavastha kii asafalataa tathaa naveen vyavastha ke liye uske dhwans kii purvakalpana karata he
 Its second major feature is that unlike democracy, it operates in the hands of one person or class to rule over others
 tisare, sattadhari khule dhang se yah ghoshit karata he ki raashtra main uskaa ek vishisht sthaan he
 Therefore, in a broad sense, a monopolistic government is a system in which one or several members of the state openly and systematically exercise power over the entire nation - which they have gained from the violence resulting from the violation of all the legitimate rights and establishments of the past - in the government Those who do not participate, remain independent of the consent of the public
 sarkaar ke swaroop ke aadhaar par ekadhinaayakatv do virgo main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : In individual monopolies, the monarch governs independently on the basis of the principle of 'furor' with the help of his personal employees
 furar kii visheshta yah he ki vah apane sahaayakon ke prati uttaradaayi nahin hota, varan apane se upar-raashtra, itihaas yaa ishwar-ke prati apana daayitv ghoshit karata he
 The furor appoints his assistants who employ the employees under him, and these workers then appoint their subordinates
 is prakaar puri vyavastha main nirvachanpaddati kaa koi sthaan nahin hota or sampurna dhaanchaa sarvopari charam bindu par avlambit hota he
 The collective monopolist consists of the leader responsible for the Furer's place; One category of leaders chooses higher-class leaders, each leader being responsible to their electors
 is prakaar sampurna dhaanchaa nimnatam aadhaar par avlambit hota he
 There can be two classes of monopolies depending on social powers
 atev yah vibhaajan shaasha tathaa sahaayak varg ke aadhaar par hota he
 There are three major modern types of class monopolies: military, party and administrative
 teesraa vargeekaran parimanatmak swaroop ke aadhaar par ho saktaa he; yatha, The three classifications of totalitarianism can also be related to each other
 yatha, sainya ekadhinaayakatv, nijee tathaa samuhik donon hi ho saktaa he
 All important monopolies have the characteristic of religious communalism, such as worship of the promoter with zeal and reverence for a specific method
 mahaan vyaktiyon se sanchalit, sadaiv aakarshak vichaardhaara se prerit, apane anuyaayiyon se kartavya ke rup main balidaan kii maang karata hua, ekadhinaayakatv sakriy vyakti dwaara sthapit sarkaar kaa ek swaroop he
 He carries with them the mighty and dynamic classes which are naturally prone to rebellion: for example, the army, the Shur class or the proletariat
 ekadhinaayak apane sankalp or bhav shasiton par aropit karata rahata he
 There are two means of this implantation: negative, positive
 nakaaratmak saadhan hai, aalochana ko rokna, virdohi bahumat yaa alpamat ko nasht karnaa, rajya sambandhi aavashyak or mahatvapurn tathyon ko gupt rakhana
 Aids to these means are: the abolition of Parliament, the dissolution of unions and parties, restrictions on the press, control over education, expulsion of major opponents, etc
 is sambandh main hinsa tathaa aatank kii bhi charchaa kii jaati hai, parantu vastut: ye ekadhinaayakatv kii keval praarambhik avasthaa ke lakshan hai jo saamanyat: krantikari or isliye avaidh hote hai
 If monolithicism is successful in passing through this stage, it usually establishes administrative legislation in place of violence and terror
 sainya ekadhinaayakatv saamanyat: inhen nakaaratmak sadhano se santusht rahata he; parantu varg ekadhinaayakatv inke atirikt sakaaratmak sadhano kaa bhi prayog karata he; yatha, prachaar dwaara adhinaayak ke bhaavon, vichaaron or maton kaa janata par aropan, icchaanukool janamat kaa srijan aadi
 Helpful tools for these tools are: the worship of national or class worshipers, the propagation of provocative music, the eloquent or the hate speech, giving military education to the whole nation for habit of obedience, preparing books for schools, propagating anti-ideology
 , To bribe politicians, journalists and scholars by bribing them
 parantu kisi bhi sabhy desh main, jiskaa nikat ateet audaaryavaadee yaa janatantric rahaa ho, ye saadhan ekadhinayakawad kii sthapana ke liye tab tak paryaapt nahin hai jab tak unke saath janata se lubhaavne aadarsho, yatha aagyaakaarita, anushaasan, satta, ekta, shakti, deshprem aadi ke liye satat apil na kii jaae or vyakti main apane nijee adhikaron ko ekadhinaayak ke haathon sompane kaa utsaahpurn bhav na ubhaara jaae
 For this, the expressions related to religion are distorted and converted into expressions of praise or worship of their state, nation, caste or class
 jis avaidh dhang se ekadhinaayakatv kii sthapana hoti he usee dhang ke atirikt uskaa unmoolan praaia: asambhav he
 Monolithicism prevents the nation from learning the methods of autonomous governance and hence the rivalry for power among individuals and classes after the death of a monopolist can lead to disaster for the nation
 adhinayakatantr vyavastha ke vyavhaar main itane laabh hai ki anek loktantric rajyon main janata loktantr main kuch logon kii manamaani karne kii swatantraaa se uubakar adhinayakatantr vyavastha kii kaamana karne lagati he
 If the reasons for the rise of the dictatorship are discovered, then it will be known that the country where there was despair, disarray, dissatisfaction and absence, the emergence of the dictatorship
 jin deshon main loktantr vyavastha logon main niraashaa tathaa abhaav utpann karne vaali bani, vahiin is vyavastha kii sthapana ho gai
 Even today, in many states, the public sees the dictatorship as good and fully supports the autocratic rulers
 isse yah spasht he ki adhinayakatantr main kuch aise gun hai jo anya vyavasthaaon kii saiddhanthik shreshthata ke baavjood is vyavastha ko apnaane ke liye prerana ke jimmedaar hai
 In short, the following benefits of such governance are- adhinayakatantr main shashan kushalta hoti he
 Due to all the power vested in one person, not only can decisions be taken quickly, but the implementation of decisions is also arranged
 adhinayakatantri vyavastha main shaasha se sabhi bhaybheet rahete hai is kaaran ve kaary main deree yaa shithilataa nahin kar sakate hai
 The entire administration is not only responsible towards the autocratic ruler, but is also alert, alert and active at all times
 isse shashan main kaary-dakshata aa jaati hai
 The second quality of this system is the rapid development of the country
 desh main ek hi netaa, ek hi yojana tathaa ek hi vikaas lakshya rahane se desh kii sampoorn shakti isi lakshya ke maarg ko prashast karne main prayukt hoti he
 Proper development and use of economic resources is possible
 desh ke vikaas ke liye ekta, shaanti va vyavastha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Due to their solid system in the dictatorship, all the resources of the country can be put into development
 desh main ekta kii sthapana main adhinayakatantr bahut sahaayak rahata he
 By suppressing various parties and opponents, due to the establishment of one party and one leader in the country, the whole public becomes loyal to it
 netaa ke chaaron taraf, sari vyavasthaaen gunth jaati hai tathaa desh ek thos ekta ke sutara main bandha jaataa he
 The party or leader becomes a means of tying in unity and in that everyone starts to feel a sense of belongingness
 hitler va musolini isi tarah germany va italy ko ek karne main safal rahe the
 It is helpful in awakening the feeling of nationalism
 desh ke nagarikon ko parsparikta main baandhne ke liye ek vichaardhaara, ek dal va ek netaa kaa hona paryaapt hota hai
 All citizens are motivated by a sense of brotherhood
 ek raashtra kaa naaraa, ek hi jhande ke neeche sabko khadaa kar detaa he
 Desh bhakti has so much importance that citizens are ready to sacrifice even for their country and leader
 sankat kaal main taanaashaahee vyavastha sarvottam rahati he
 In this, due to all decisions and ideals given by one person to face the crisis, there is unity of orders
 isse samay par uchit kaarywahi karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 This system gives victory in wartime crisis
 adhinayakatantr vyavastha main desh kaa bahumukhi vikaas hota he
 There is also a system of rapid development in the economic sector
 ekta, anushaasan va kartavya-parayanata ke kaaran vikaas kii shreshth vyavastha ho jaati he
 The history of Russia, Germany, China, Italy, Turkey and Spain so far is a testimony to this fact
 jekson ne apni pustak ‘europe cins di war’ main thik hi likhaa he- ”spainvaasiyon ke itihaas main yah pehla avasar he jabaki railen samay par chali hai
 Trade and industry have prospered under the dictatorship
 krishi faliphuli he
 Labor crises have gone away
 “ Some scholars consider the Adhinayakatantra to be human-friendly
 iske paksh main unka kahana he ki manushya main swabhaavatah apane hiton kii raksha kii ichha avashya hoti he
 He wants his protection whether it is done by anyone
 apni samasyaon kaa samaadhaan chahta he
 Does it not matter to the general public that his defense system is powerful? She wants security, wants her interests fulfilled
 adhinayakatantr main aisa sambhav hone ke kaaran yah maanav swabhaav ke anukool vyavastha bhi maani jaati he
 The dictatorship has also been considered useful for developing states in transitional conditions of political and economic development
 vikasshil rajyon main janaichha kii anushaasit abhivyakti kii samasya atyant prabal rahi he
 In an effort to cross various stages of development, budding nations awaken to the people's aspirations, but the faster the public aspirations, the faster they are not able to fulfill them
 iske kaaran rajya vyavastha par tanaav badhate hai evam uske tuutane kaa dar rahata he
 In such a situation the dictatorship may be more useful for maintaining political discipline
 hanitagton ne thik hi kaha he ki ‘navdith raashton main pratham kaary raajnneetik sahbhaag, shiksha aadi kii vruddhi ke sthaan par moolbhoot, sansthaatmak dhaanche kaa nirmaan hona chahie tathaa iske liye ekadaleey shashan yaa sainik adhinayakatantr bhi upyukt ho saktaa he
 ' adhinayakatantr main gunon ke hote hue bhi is pranali kaa kisi bhi desh main lambi avadhi tak prachlan nahin rah paata he
 History is replete with such evidence that wherever the dictatorship is established, there is a situation when the public does not hesitate to resort to a violent revolution to overthrow the supreme ruler in power
 isse spasht he ki is vyavastha main kuch kamiyaan avashya pai jaati hai
 In short, the defects of this system are as follows- is vyavastha main vyakti ke vyaktitv kaa sammaan nahin hone ke kaaran vyakti ko sab kuch suvidhaayen hote hue bhi use apane vyaktitv ko apni icchaanusaar viksit karne kaa vaataavaran nahin mil paata he tathaa vah apane jivan ko apurna hi rakhane par majaboor ho jaataa he
 The person does not have freedom in any way
 isse uskaa vyaktitv dabakar rah jaataa he
 Fundamental rights and personal liberty are not given any importance in the dictatorship system
 atah taanaashaahee vyavastha kaa sabase bada durgun vyakti ke vyaktitv ke daman kaa vaataavaran bananaa he
 Atrocity and incest is dominated by the dictatorship regime
 adhinaayak apni satta ko bana rakhane ke li aatank failaa rakhata he
 Opponents are eliminated by barbaric methods
 isse maanav bhaygrast hokar jail ke sikhchon main band sa ho jaataa he
 If anything said in the interest of the country is contrary to the dictator's will, he is turned down and the person who speaks against him is called a traitor
 taanaashaahee vyavastha desh ke liye ahitkar hoti he
 In this arrangement the decision is taken by a person who does not accept any kind of protest or suggestion
 isse taanashaah dwaara liye gayi galat nirnyon kaa ahitkar prabhaav sari praja ko bhugatna padataa he
 Every directive of the Adhinayak has to be accepted by the people, whether it is in the national interest or not
 is prr car taanaashaahee vyavastha main rashtiy hiton kaa samuchit sangrakshan nahin rahata he
 In the Adhinayaktantra, the sense of self-reliance, action and freedom is completely lost in ordinary people, because they have no freedom to speak or think, etc
 is vyavastha main vyakti kaa tan, dhan or yahaan tak ki man bhi adhinaayak ke liye ho jaataa he or use adhinaayak jidhar hankey udhar hi chalane ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 It is clear from the discussion of the merits and demerits of the Adhinayaktantra that this system does not make man a human being and does not even allow him to live as a human being
 isamen maanav kaa vyaktitv dabakar rah jaataa he
 Even after fulfilling all his material needs, he feels something lacking
 uskaa jivan kaidi kaa sa ho jaataa he
 That is why despite many benefits of Adhinayaktantra, a person does not like to live under this system
 is shashan main vyakti ke liye sab kuch rahata he parantu phir bhi usko aisi vyavastha main ghutan hone lagati he, kyonki vyakti keval roti ke liye hi jivit nahi rahata he
 Apart from this, he wants to achieve and do a lot of things which are possible only in the atmosphere of freedom of thought and expression
 atah adhinayakatantr sabhi aakarshanon ke baavjood bhi tanaav mastishk kii bhukh mitaane ke sadhano par roak lagane vaala hone ke kaaran jan saadhaaran dwaara amaanya hi rahata he
 After thinking about the merits and demerits of this regime, it becomes easy to indicate about its future

 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00719 uttar pradesh ke jile The Boeing 747 aircraft is a large commercial aircraft and cargo transport aircraft, often known by the nickname Jumbo Jet or Queen of the Skies

 The original version of the 747, manufactured by the Boeing Commercial Airplane unit in the United States, was two and a half times the size of the Boeing 707, one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s

 Boeing designed the 747's hump-like upper floor to be used as a first-class lounge or to easily convert the aircraft into a freighter by removing more seats for additional meetings and installing a cargo door in front

 1963 main america vayusena ne ek bahut bade samrik parivahan vimaan par adhyayan pariyojnaon kii shrinkhalaa aarambh kii thi
 Although the C-141 Starlifter was being launched, they felt that there was a need for a much larger and capable aircraft, especially with the capability to transport excess cargo not included in any existing aircraft

 On 18 May 1964, airframe proposals were received from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed and Martin Marietta, while engine proposals were submitted by General Electric, curtis-wright and Pratt & Whitney
 ek praarambhik chayan prakriya ke baad, bowing, duglas or lochid ko airfrem ke atirikt adhyayan anubandh ke saath general electric or prat evam vitni ko ingine kaa anubandh diya gaya

 Joe Sutter was transferred from the Boeing 737 development team to manage the study for a new aircraft in 1965, which had already been given model number 747
 sater ne pan em tathaa anya airlinon ke saath, unki aavashyaktaaon ko behatar dhang se samajhane ke liye, ek dizin adhyayan aarambh kiya
 At the time it was widely believed that the 747 would eventually be replaced by a supersonic transport aircraft
 Despite sales being rejected for its passenger version, Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be easily adapted for freight and it could remain in production

 Being an early customer and its initial involvement before formal orders were made, Pan Am succeeded in influencing the design and development of the 747 to such an extent that it remained unmatched for any one airline before and after
 antat oonche pankhons vaale siex-echeles bowing dizin kaa 747 ke liye upyog nahin kiya gaya, haalanki apni boli ke liye viksit kii gai unki praudyogikiyon kaa prabhaav hua tha
 The original design consisted of a full-length two-story torso of the aircraft, which had eight rows of eight seats and two corridors on the lower floor and seven rows of seven seats on the upper floor and a corridor
 haalanki, nikasi margon kii samasya or simit maal vahan kshamta ke kaaran is vichaar ko, 1966 main ek vyapak ek manjila dizin ke paksh main tyaag diya gaya
 The cockpit was therefore briefly placed on the second floor to include a door for loading goods into the front nose or cone; This design feature gave rise to the distinctive "bulge" of the 747
 aarambhik modelon main yah spasht nahin tha ki cockpit ke peeche sandooknuma chote se sthaan kaa kya kiya jaae, isliye shuru main ise bina sthai baithak vyavastha ke vishram kaksh ke rup main "chihnit" kiya gaya
 One of the technologies that made it possible to envision making an aircraft as large as a 747 was the high-bypass turbofan engine
 Engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering twice as much power by consuming one-third less fuel than earlier turbojets
 general electric ne is avadharana kaa bidaa uthaaya tha, lekin vah si-5 gallaxi ke liye ingine ke vikaas ke prati patibaddh rahi tathaa baad tak vyavsaayik bazaar main nahin utari

 bowing 1969 ke ant tak pan em ko pehla 747 dene par sahamat hui
 There were only 28 months left before the delivery date to design the aircraft, which was two-thirds of the normal time

 Since Boeing did not have a large plant to manufacture this huge aircraft, they thought of building a new plant
 company ne sthaan ke liye lagbhag 50 shaharon par vichaar kiya or antat evarett, washington ke nikat sainik adde pen field ke bagal main, sietal se lagbhag 30 mile uttar main nayaa sanyantr banane kaa nirnay kiya
 It purchased the 780-acre site in 1966
 747 kaa vikaas ek badi chunauti thi or uske sangyojan sanyantr kaa nirmaan bhi ek vishaal upkram tha
 Boeing president William M
 Allen asked Malcolm T
 Stamper, then head of the company's turbine division, to oversee the construction of the Everett factory and start production of the 747
 More than four million cubic yards of soil had to be removed to level the site
 samay itnaa kam tha ki iske upar kaarkaane kii chat purna hone se pehle hi 747 kii purna aakaar kii pratikruti bana lee gai thi
 By size, the plant is the largest of the buildings built to date and has been expanded several times to manufacture other models of Boeing widebody commercial jets
 747 ke purna sangyojan se purv iske anek ghatakon or pranaaliyon kaa pareekshan shuru hua
 a critical test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from the cabin of the aircraft's replica via emergency prone
 pehali purna paimaane kii nikasi ne sangheey uddyan prashasan dwaara die gaye adhiktam samay 90 second kii bajaay dhai minute kaa samay laga or kai swayamsevak ghayal ho gaye
 In subsequent tests, the target of evacuation was achieved in 90 seconds but more people were injured
 The evacuation from the top floor of the aircraft was the most problematic; Instead of using the traditional slippery, the volunteer passengers left with the help of a gene attached to a pulley
 The tests also involved driving such a large aircraft on land
 bowing dwaara vaidles wagon naamak ek asaamaanya prashikshan yukti kaa nirmaan kiya gaya jisamen ek trek kii chat par nakli cockpit ko sthapit kiya gaya tha, jabaki pehle 747 abhi banaae hi ja rahe the, is yukti ke kaaran vimaan chaalkon ko upree manzil se jameen par vimaan kaa abhyaas mil gaya
 On 30 September 1968, the first 747 Everett Combination exited the building in front of representatives of the world's press and 26 airlines who ordered the aircraft
 Preparations were made for the first flight in the coming months, with Jack Waddle on the test driver's seat, Brian Weigle on control, and Jess Volick at the flight engineer station on 9 February 1969
 ek flap ke saath ek choti si samasya ke baavjood, udaan se pushti hui ki 747 ko bahut acchhee tarah sambhala gaya
 a major threat to the initial "swept-wing" jet was the 747 found to be widely immune to the "dutch-roll" phenomenon
 udaan pareekshan kaarykram ke baad ke charnon ke dauraan, spandan pareekshan ne darshaya ki kuch paristhitiyon mempankhons mendolan paaya gaya
 This difficulty was partially solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components

 raajnneetik dal athwa rajnatik dal ek raajnneetik sanstha he jo shashan main raajnneetik shakti praapt karne evam use banaaye rakhane kaa praytn karata he
 For this, he often participates in the election process
 raajnneetik dalon kaa apana ek siddhanth yaa lakshya hota he jo praaia: likhit dastavej ke rup main hota he
 Political parties have different positions and arrangements in different countries
 kuch deshon main koi bhi raajnneetik dal nahin hota
 Somewhere only one team is surveyed
 kahin mukhyatah do dal hote hai
 But many countries have more than two parties
 loktantrik rajnatik vyavastha main rajnatik dalon kaa sthaan kendriya avadharana ke rup main atyant mahatvapurn he
 Political parties represent the distribution of power in a social system and individuals and groups aspiring for power
 ve paraspar virdohi hiton ke saraneekaran, anushaasan or saamanjasy kaa pramukh saadhan rahe hai
 In this way political parties are also related to the goals of social order, social mobility, social changes, barriers to change and social movements
 rajnatik dalon kaa adhyayan samajashastri or raajnneetishastri donon karte hai, lekin donon ke drushtikonon main paryaapt antar he
 Sociologists consider political parties as social groups, while politicians view political parties as a major institution of government formation in the modern state
 raajnneetik dal kii sanrachana main kuch aisi visheshtaayen hai jo ise anya samooh se alag karti hai - With the above characteristics one can see the political party as different from other organization
 raajnneetik dal kaa gathan samaaj vyavastha kii do visheshtaon dwaara paaya jaataa he - Maurice Duverger has presented a critical analysis of the social organization of the political party
 inhone dal ke sanghathan ko chaar sutreey vargeekaran dwaara samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 These categories are cocks dal ke jane-pahachaane logon kaa ek laghu samooh kaha ja saktaa he jo na apane vistaar or na hi apni bhartee main ruchi rakhata he
 Actually it is a closed group
 jisaki prakruti arddh-sthaayee hoti he
 Only during elections, the caucus is more active and inactive during elections
 iske sadasyon kii nune sankhya isaki shakti kaa maap nahin he kyonki iske sadasyon kaa vyaktigat prabhaav, shakti evam kshamta unki sankhya se kaaphi adhik hoti he
 Therefore, their influence and capacity is more important than the number of its renowned members
 duverjar ne francisi radical party or 1918 se purv kii british lebar party ko iskaa udhaaharan bataaya he
 With the expansion of the franchise the 'caucus' type of party declines
 shakha yaa branch dal parishmi europe main matadhikaar ke vistaar kaa parinaam he
 It belongs to the public and like the caucus, it is not a closed group because number is given more importance than qualities
 atah yah adhik se adhik sadasyon kii bhartee main sadaiv ruchi rakhata he
 Their political activities are not limited to elections only, but they continue
 branch cocks kii apeksha bada samooh he isliye iskaa sanghathan adhik hota he tathaa isamen cocks kii apeksha adhik ekikaran paaya jaataa he
 In this, the division of strata and duties is clear and there is also an idea of localism and narrowness
 isamen adhiktar kendrikrut dal sanrachana hoti he or praarambhik ikaiyaan nirvachan kshetron kii hi bhaanti bhugolic aadhaar par sangathit hoti hai
 All the characteristics of the branch are found in the socialist parties of Europe
 catholic or anudaaravaadi dalon ne newnaadhik safaltaapurvak iskaa anusaran kiya he
 The German Social Democratic Party is a good example of this type of party on an organizational basis
 duverjar dwaara bataaya gaya dal sanghathan kaa teesraa prakaar koshthak yaa cell he jo krantikari samyavaadee dalon kii khoj he
 It is a much smaller group than branch and its base is commercial rather than geographical
 vyavsaayik aadhaar ke kaaran cell kisi sthaan par kaary karne vaale sabhi sadasyon ko ek sutara main bandhna he
 Factories, workshops, offices and administration etc
 can be its parts
 chunki cell un sadasyon kaa samooh hai jo ek hi vyavsaay main lage hue hai tathaa jo pratidin kaary ke samay milte hai, isliye iske sadasyon main daleey ekaatmakataa adhik hoti he
 Individual cells have no direct connection to other cells
 cell kaa sanghathan anivaary rup se shadyantrakari hota he or isaki nirmaan style is baat kaa pakkaa intjaam karti he ki ek cell ke nasht hone par sampoorn dal-sanrachana sankat main pade kyonki ek hi str par pruthak-pruthak ikaayiyon ke bich koi sampark nahin rahata
 It is the most suitable medium for covert activism
 isaki gupt sakriyataayen mukhyatah rajnatik hoti hai tathaa sadasyon ke liye adhik mahatvapurn hoti hai
 Instead of winning votes, grouping of representatives and keeping contact with the representatives of the voters, the SAIL is a means of struggle, propaganda, discipline and if necessary, secret activism
 inamen chunaav jeetne kii duusare darje ke mahatv kii baat maanane kii pravriti hoti he
 The notion of Praja Tantrik centralism establishes centralized control over all aspects of the party, the example of which was the Leninist party before 1917
 duverjar francisi samyavaadee dal ke sadasyon main cell sanrachana ke prati shatru bhav hone kaa bhi sanket karte hai
 Duverger's fourth type of contingent is the militia type organization
 yah ek prakaar kii nijee sena he jiske sadasyon ko sainikon kii tarah bhartee kiya jaataa he tathaa jinhen sainik sanghathan kii bhanti anushaasan main rahanaa or prashikshan lenaa padataa he
 Its structure is also similar to the military structure i
e
 its members are organized like troops from troops, companies and battalions
 milicia sena ke adhikramik lakshan grahan kar leti he
 The militia has no interest in elections and parliamentary activities because it is a more fundamental means of overthrowing it than strengthening the democratic system
 jis prakaar cell ek samyavaadee khoj he, thik usee prakaar milicia krantikariyon kii khoj he
 Hitler's aggressive troops and Mussolini's revolutionary militia are examples of such a structure
 inaki ore duverjar yah sanket karte hai ki keval milicia ke aadhaar par kabhi bhi koi raajnneetik dal nahin bana he
 Their history is not very ancient in the organized form in which political parties exist before us today
 unki utpatti unnisvin shatabdi main hui he parantu isse purv bhi manushyon dwaara nirmit kuch sanghathan, shashan se pratyaksh na hone par bhi janamat ke nirmaan tathaa maangon ko shaskaon tak pahunchane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate rahe hai
 In modern society, political parties have been formed on various grounds
 raajnneetik dalon ke nirmaan main manovaigyanik aadhaar arthath maanav swabhaav main nihit pravritiyaan pramukh hai
 Unity and organization are the two main trends of human nature
 samaan swabhaav evam mulyon vaale vyakti sangathit hokar raajnneetik dal kaa nirmaan karte hai tathaa phir un mulyon ko banaaye rakhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 The British Conservative Party is formed by individuals supportive of maintaining the conservative system
 kuch vyakti roodhiwaadee vyavastha main parivartan laana chaahate hai tathaa is uddeshy kii purti ke liye udaaravaadi dalon kaa nirmaan karte hai, jabaki kuch log vigat yug kii punrariti kii aakanksha ke aadhaar par pratikriyaavaadi dalon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Religion has played an important role in the politics of human history and even today in many countries religious leaders and officials directly or indirectly interfere in politics
 rajnatik dalon ke saamaajik sanghathan main dharm pramukh bhoomika nibhaataa he
 For example, religion plays a central role in social organization of parties like Muslim League, Akali Dal, Jana Sangh and Hindu Mahasabha in India
 raajnneetik dalon ke nirmaan main kshetreeyata athwa pradeshikta bhi ek pramukh aadhaar he
 Some regional parties are formed for the protection of territorial interests and for speedy settlement of territorial problems
 bharat main di0em0ke0, telugana praja samiti, assam gana parishad, jharkhand mukti morcha aadi
 Political parties are also organized on economic or class grounds
 marks ke anusaar raajnneetik dalon tathaa virgon kaa paraspar sambandh rajya va raajnneeti ke siddhanth kaa kendriya bindu hota he
 Through numerous investigations, we find that there is a close correlation between class interests, party affiliations and choice of elections and in most of the society political parties represent electoral class interests
 britain main shramik dal, bharat main majdoor dal, kisaan union aadi
 Caste is a fundamental feature of Indian society
 bharat main rajnatik dalon ke saamaajik sanghathan ko jati hameshaa se prabhavit karti rahi he
 Before independence, the movement for caste liberation has been influencing the formation of political parties
 dalit varg kalyaan lig, bahishkrut hitkaarini sabha, justise party iske pramukh udhaaharan hai
 After independence, 'caste' became the major social base bringing political mobility in the election competition
 ‘jaateey sanlayan’ or ‘jaateey vikhandan’ rajnatik prakriyaaon main kendriya bhoomika nibhaane lagi
 All political parties decided on the basis of caste calculation
 vartmaan samay main jaateey aadhaar par rajnatik dalon ke gathan kaa pramukh aadhaar he
 Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal United etc
 are the prime examples
 daleey sanghathan main vichaardhaara bhi pramukh bhoomika nibhaati he
 The formation of several parties based on socialist, Leninist and Maoist ideologies has been a major feature of Indian politics

 Thermochemistry also includes the study of the physical changes that occur as a result of energy exploitation or emission, etc
)
 iske saath-saath ushma dharita, jvalan kii ushma, nirmaan kii ushma, inthalpi evam mukt urja kii gananaa bhi kii jaati he
 Typically, a reaction expresses the heat absorbed or absorbed by its equation
 udhaaharan ke liye : H2 + Cl2 = 2hcl + 44,000 calories dwaara pakat hota he ki 1 gram-anu hydrogen gas tathaa 1 gram-anu chlorine gas se sangyojan se jab 2 gram-anu hydrochloric amla gas banati he, to 44,000 calories ushma kshepit hoti he
 Similarly, see the following equation: H2 + I2 = 2hcl - 11,860 calories It is revealed that if 256 grams of hydrogen iodide gas is made by combining 2 grams of hydrogen and 254 grams of iodine gas, 11,860 calories of heat will be absorbed in this reaction
 yah to spasht he ki kisi bhi kriya main kshepit ushma kii maatra usamen bhaag lenevaale padaarthon kii bhautik avasthaa par nirbhar rahegi; isiilie bhi likh jaati he
 The effect of the physical state on the reaction heat will be clear from the following example: tathaa In the second equation, the amount of heat dissipated is higher than in the first equations because it contains the amount of heat dissolved in 18 grams of steam being dissolved
 jin pratikriyaaon main pratikaarakon ke aaytan main bhi parivartan hota he, unke liye pratikriya-ushma is baat par bhi nirbhar hogi ki pratikriya sthir aaytan par kii gai he athwa sthir daab par
 If the volume is kept constant while reacting, the board does not have to do anything against the external pressure
 atev sthir aaytan par pratikriya kii yatharth urja kshepit yaa shoshit hoti he
 But if the volume is allowed to increase or decrease while keeping the pressure constant while performing the action, the exact value of the reaction heat will not be known
 udhaaharan ke liye; aaytan badhane main mandal bahya daab ke viruddh kaary karata he, jisamen urja vyay hogi; atev yadi pratikriya ushmakshepak he to is avasthaa main kshepit kii maatra kam ho jaaegi
 Normally the heat of reactions is measured at a constant volume
 ushmarsayan ke drushtikon se abhikriyaaon ko praaia: kai virgon main baant lete hai or abhikriya swabhaav ke anukool abhikriya-ushma ko naam de diya jaataa he - jaise vilyan-ushma, tanukaran-ushma, utpaadan-ushma, dahan-ushma tathaa shithilikaran-ushma 
 Heat dissipation often occurs when a solute is dissolved in a solvent
 jo lavan jal se kriya karke jalyojit lavan banaate hai unke ghulne par adhiktar ushma kaa kshepan hota he
 The amount of heat absorbed in dissolving other salts is very small
 kisi padaarth ke ek gram-anu ko vilaayak main gholne par kshepit yaa shoshit urja kii maatra ko vilyan-ushma kehete hai
 In addition, there is also a change in heat in diluting the concentrated solution and this is called dilution-heat of the solution
 tanukaran-ushma kii maatra vilyanon kii tanuta ke saath kam haati jaati he or adhik tanu vilyanon ke liye ise shunya mana ja saktaa he
 In the thermochemistry of such dilute solutions, it is called "aqueous"
 udhaaharan ke liye; potacium nitrate jal main villin hokar ati banu vilyan banaata he, to uski vilyan ushma 8,500 calories hoti he
 This fact can be expressed by the following equation: avyav tatwon ke sanyog se kisi yogic ke ek gram-anu banane main jitani ushma shoshit yaa kshepit hoti he, use us yogic kii utpaadan-ushma kaha jaataa he
 For example, it is clear by the following equations that the production of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitric acid is thermally 94
4, 18
8 and 42
4 calories: utpaadan ushma rinatmak bhi ho sakati he, jaise : The compounds that heat dissolves in the formation of essential elements are called exothermic compounds, and the compounds in which heat is absorbed in formation are called thermodynamic compounds
 adhiktar yogic ushmakshepak hote hai, jaise hydrogen, chloride, jal, hydrogen salafid, salfar dioxide, carbon dioxide, lead chloride aadi sab ushmakshepak yogic hai
 Examples of thermodynamic compounds can be given such as hydrogen iodide, carbon disulfide, acetylene, ozone etc
 ushmashoshak yogic ushmakshepak yogicon kii apeksha bahut kam sthaayee hote hai or sugamawa se apane avyaviya tatwon main vichchhedit ho jate hai
 The above distinction of durability of exothermic and exothermic compounds is due to the difference of energy inherent in them
 udhaaharan ke liye; 1 gram-anu carbon tathaa 1 gram-anu oxygen ke sanyog se jab 1 gram-anu carbon dioxide banataa he, to 94,300 calories ushma kshepit hoti he
 It is clear that 1 gram-molecule of carbon dioxide will have 94,300 calories less energy than its constituents
 isi prakaar carbon dicelphide jaise ushmashoshak yogic main apen avyav tatwon kii apeksha 22,000 calories urja adhik hogi
 If the intrinsic energy of all elements is taken to be zero, then it is clear from the appropriate interpretation that the inherent energy of the compounds will be equal to their production heat; But if the output energy is negative then the underlying energy will be positive and conversely if the output is heat positive, the underlying energy will be negative
 udhaahrant: carbon dioxide tathaa carbon dicelaphid kii antarnihit urjaayen krmanusaar - 94,300 tathaa 22,000 calories ke baraabar hongi
 The amount of heat that is absorbed by burning one gram-molecule of an element y compound completely at a constant volume in oxygen is called combustion-heat of that element or compound
 udhaaharan ke liye nimnlikhit sameekaran se spasht he ki methen kii dahan-ushma 2,12,800 calories he : On burning carbon in oxygen, it is possible to form two compounds - yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki carbon kii dahan-ushma 94,300 calories he, 26,000 calories nahin, kyonki pratham kriya main hi carbon purnataya jalataa yaa oxykrut hota he
 In the second process, carbon is converted to carbon monoxide, but its combustion is not complete yet because carbon monoxide can be further combusted and oxidized to carbon dioxide
 dahan-ushma gyaat karne ke liye ek vishesh prakaar ke calorimapak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise bam-calorimapak kehete hai
 Scientific Barthels first built it in 1881
 yah ganmetal ispaat kaa bana rahata he or belan ke aakar kaa hota he
 a special type of enamel is placed on its inner plane, due to which there is no action of oxygen on it
 dhakkan dha ko dridhtaa se band karne ke liye isamen majboot pench lage rahete hai
 a certain amount of the substance to be combusted is taken into the platinum cup "P" and the oxygen is filled at about 20-25 atmospheric pressure in the bomb
 iske baad vam ko dridhtaa se band karke use saadhaaran calorimapak main rakhte hai
 a certain amount of water is taken in an ordinary colorimeter and by experiment it is already determined how much heat is required to increase the temperature of the water in this colorimeter by 1 degree centigrade
 bahya calorimapak main jal kaa taap naap liya jaataa he
 Now platinum wires a and a conduct electricity in a fine wire of iron
 vidyutpravaah se taar t garam hokar laal ho jaataa he or pyaali pa main rakhaa padaarth oxykrut hone lagata he
 In the burning of iron wire and in this process of oxidation, heat is absorbed, the amount of which is determined by an increase in the temperature of the water present in the external colorimeter
 is prayog se praapt ushma-maatra main se lohe ke jvalan main kshepit ushma ko ghataakar padaarth ke dahan dwaara kshepit ushma kii maatra gyaat kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that in this experiment the volume of the circle is constant; Therefore, combustion-heat of a substance can be determined by this method
 ek gram-tulya maatra kshar ko ek gram-tulya maatra amla dwaara shithil karne par ushma kii jo maatra lepit hoti he use shithilikaran-ushma kehete hai
 If acid and alkali are taken up in such dilute solutions that they are completely decomposed into ions, the action of relaxation will be the formation of undissociated molecules by simply combining hydrogen and hydroxyl ions
 atev tanu vilyanon main sab prabal amlon dwaara prabal kshaaron ke shithilikaran kii ushma samaan hogi
 The value of this heat is 13,700 calories by experiment
 at: prabal amlon dwaara prabal kshar ke shithilikaran ko nimnlikhit samikarnon dwaara vyakt kar sakate hai : Where x is a radical and m is a metal, arthath Ie parantu yadi amla yaa kshar durbal ho, to vah tanu vilyan main bhi purnataya vighatit na hoga
 Therefore, the relaxing heat of such acids or bases will not yield 13,700 calories
 udhaaharan ke liye ammonium hydroxide kii ynikaran-ushma -1,500 calories he, atev ammonium hydroxide tathaa kisi prabal amla kii shithilikaran ushma 12,200 calories hogi
 To determine the heat dissipated by the experiment, a certain amount of alkali-diluted solution in a thermos flask is then immersed in the steady water with a certain amount of alkali diluted solution, so that radiation does not alter the temperature of the solution within the flask
 ab banu vilyan main amla kii samatuly maatra lekar uskaa taap kshar ke taap ke baraabar sthir kar lete hai
 Once the temperature of the acid is stable, it is quickly added to alkali
 kaach ke ek vilodak dwaara vilyan ko chalaakar uskaa ucchtam taap naap liya jaataa he
 Now if the quantity of the alloy solution, its specific heat, heat, the heat dissipation of the flask used, is known, then the amount of heat absorbed in the relaxation process can be easily determined
 isi vidhi dwaara lavenon kii vilyan-ushma bhi sugamawa se nikaal sakate hai
 The most important law of thermochemistry was formulated by Swiss scientist Germain Henry Hess in 1840
 is niyam ke anusaar, Hess's law has proved very useful in thermochemistry
 isaki sahaayta se pratyaksh rup se na kii ja sakanevaali pratikriyaaon main honevaale ushma-parivartanon ko bhi paroksh rup se nikaala ja saktaa he
 for example; Ordinarily, the production-heat of organic compounds cannot be extracted by direct action, but by determining the combustion-heat of the organic compound and its elements, the production-heat of the compound can be removed by Hess's law
 rasinic kriyaaon se praapt urja hi hamaare udyogon ko chalaane kaa saadhan rahi he
 Today, in the era of artificial satellites, when humans are trying to travel to the moon and other planets, it has become necessary to search for fuels whose micro to microscopic quantity can give more energy
 boran yogic is ore bahut upyogi siddh ho rahe hai, kyonki samaan maatra main carbon yogicon se unki dahan-ushma adhik hoti he or ve hamen adhik urja dene main safal hote hai
 Other uses of thermochemistry have been around for a long time
 udhaaharan ke liye ;pratham talika main aluminium auksaide kii utpaadan-ushma sabase adhik dikhaai gai he
 The same property has been used in Goldschmitt's heating method
 aluminium oxide kii utpaadan-ushma itani adhik hone ke kaaran pratikriya, इतनी so much heat is absorbed that the temperature of the mantle reaches about 3,000 centigrade and melts to iron

 Despite this, Ali made no resistance against the standardized mus'haf

 dusron ne apana samarthan joda or abu bakar ko pehla khalipha banaaya gaya tha
 The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who said that Ali was nominated by Muhammad as his successor
 baad main jab fatimah or ali ne khalipha ke adhikaar ke maamle main sahaygiyon se sahaayta maangi, to unhone uttar diya, 'he bhagwaan ke macenjar kii beti! hamane abu bakar ko apana nishtha diya he
 If Ali had come to us earlier, we certainly would not have abandoned him
 ali ne kaha, 'kya yah uchit tha ki paigambar ko dafnaae jane se pehle hamen khalipha par jhagada karnaa chahie?' After the Khilafat election, Abu Bakr and Umar along with some other companions went to Fatima's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered to pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr
 phir, yah aarope lagaaya gaya he ki umr ne aag lagane kii dhamkee di thi jab tak ve baahar nahin aae or abu bakar ke prati nishtha kii kasam khai

 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne umr ke chayan ko khalipha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or yahaan tak ki unki betiyon um kulthum ko shaadi main bhi diya

 Sunnis identify the first four Caliphs as the rightful successors of Muhammad
 shiyas kaa maananaa he ki mohammad ne spasht rup se ali ko gadir khum main unke uttaradhikari ke rup main namit kiya or muslim netritv unase sambandhit tha jo divya aadesh dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye the
 According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was convinced of his legitimacy for the Caliph based on his close association with Muhammad, his close relationship and his knowledge of Islam and his qualifications in serving his virtues
 unhone abu bakar se kaha ki khalipha ke rup main nishtha ko pratigya karne main unki deree unke pehle ke sheershak kii unki dharna par aadhaarit thi
 Ali ultimately pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and Uthman, but did so for the unity of Islam, once it became clear that the Muslims had turned away from him
 ali ne yah bhi mana ki vah is ladaai ke bina imamet kii apni bhoomika puri kar saktaa he
 At the beginning of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, there was a dispute between Muhammad's daughter, especially Phadak, Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other
 fatima ne abu bakar se apni sampatti, fada or khayabar kii bhoomi ko badalane ke liye kaha 
 But Abu Bakr refused and told him that the prophets had no inheritance and that Phadak belonged to the Muslim community
 abu bakar ne usase kaha, "allaah ke prerit ne kaha, hamaare uttaradhikari nahin hai, jo kuch bhi ham chhodte hai vah sadaaka he 
 "together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad gave it to Fatima Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested him to summon witnesses for his claim
 fatima gusse main ho gai or abu bakar se baat karnaa band kar diya, or jab tak vah mar gai, tab tak vah ravaiya maanate rahe
 'aisha also states that "when the Apostle of Allah died, his wives asked Uthman to send Abu Bakr to ask for his share of the inheritance
 " tab 'aisha ne unase kaha, "kya allaah ke prerit ne nahin kaha,' hamaari sampatti viraasat main nahin he, or jo bhi ham chhodte hai vah daan main kharch kiya janaa chahie?" According to some sources, Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr sometime after the death of his wife Fatima in the year 633
 'ali ne abu bakar ke antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 He pledged allegiance to the second Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor

 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's son-in-law
 iske alaava, umr ne abdur rahamaan ko casting vot diya
 Abdur Rahman offered the Caliph to Ali on the condition that he should rule according to the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedent set by the first two Caliphs
 ali ne teesri shart se inkaar kar diya jabaki uthman ne use sweekaar kar liya
 His reputation at the summit of Ilokens Ali was emphasized according to the comments of Ilon Abi al-hadid, but most voters reluctantly urged Uthman and Ali to support him
 'uthman ebn' afaan ne apane rishtedaar banu abd-shams kii ore udaartaa vyakt kii, jo unke upar haaavee hone lagate the, or abu dhar al-ghifaari, abd-allaah ebn masood or amaar jaise kai shuruaati saathi ke prati unke ghamandi durvyavhaar ebn yasir ne logon ke kuch samoohon ke bich apmaan ko uksaaya
 Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose in most of the empire from 650–651 onwards

 When Uthman's relatives, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the Great Council, which included most of the members of the Voters' Council, turned against him or at least withdrew his support, pressuring the Caliphate and his ways
 Reducing the impact of your firm relationship
 is samay, ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 On several occasions Ali disagreed with Udhaman in the application of Hudud; He had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dhrr al-ghifari and spoke strongly in defense of Ammar ibn Yasir
 unhone uthman ko anya sahyogiyon kii aalochanaon ke bare main bataaya or uthman kii taraf se prantiy virodhiyon ke saath vaartakar ke rup main kaary kiya jo madina aae the; is vajah se ali or uthman ke parivaar ke bich kuch avishvaas utpann hua prathit hota he
 Eventually, he tried to reduce the severity of the siege with his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water
 itihaaskaaron ke bich ali or uthman ke bich sambandhon ke bare main vivaad he
 Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies
 vishesh rup se, unhone dharmik kanoon ke sawaal par uthman ke saath sangharsh kiya
 He insisted that religious punishment should be done in many cases like Ubaid Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Ukba
 tirthayatra ke dauraan 650 main, unhone uthman se prarthana anushthan ke parivartan ke liye apmaan ke saath saamana kiya
 When Uthman announced that he would take whatever he had from the fees, Ali said that the caliph would be forced into that case
 ali ne ebn masood jaise khalipha dwaara maatrutiv se saathi kii raksha karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, some historians consider Ali as one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the chief
 lekin wilferd madelangais tathy ke kaaran unke faisle ko khaarij kar diya gaya ki ali ke paas khalipha ke rup main chune jane ke liye kuraishi kaa samarthan nahin tha
 According to him, there is no evidence that Ali had close ties with the rebels who supported his caliphate or directed his actions
 kuch anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 However, Madelang told Marwan that Ali's grandson Zayn al-abidin had said that koi bhi aapke guru kii tulana main hamaare guru kii tulana main adhik samshitoshna tha
 During one of the most difficult periods in Muslim history, Ali was the Caliph between 656 and 661, which also coincided with the first Fitnah
 chunki jin sangharshon main ali shaamil the, ve dhruviya sampradayik itihaslekh main kaayam the, jeevani saamagree aksar pakshpatpurna hoti he
 But the sources agree that he was a deeply religious man, who was ruled by justice because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah; He was engaged in a war against Muslims in terms of religious duties
 sutron ne apane tapasya, dharmik kartavyon kaa kathor paalan, or sansaarik vastuon se alag hone par notice main ullekh kiya he
 Thus some authors have reported that they lack political skills and flexibility
 uthman kii hatya kaa matlab tha ki vidrohiyon ko ek nayaa khalipha chunanaa padaa
 This met with difficulties as the rebels were divided into several groups including Muhajirun, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basarites
 teen ummidavaar the: ali, talhah or al-jubayr 
 First the rebels approach Ali, requesting him to be the fourth Caliph
 mohammad ke kuch saathi ne ali ko karyaalay sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii, lekin unhone prastaav ko band kar diya, ek pramukh ke bajaay paramarshdaata hone kaa suzav diya
 Talha, Zubayr, and other companions refused the Khalifa's offer of rebels
 isliye, vidrohiyon ne madina ke nivaasiyon ko ek din ke bheetar ek khalipha chunane kii chetavanee di, yaa ve kathor karrwai lagu karenge
 To resolve the deadlock, Muslims gathered at al-masjid an-nabawi on June 18, 656 to appoint a caliph
 prarambh main, 'ali ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki sirf unke sabase shashakt samarthak vidrohiyon the
 However, when some of Muhammad's notable companions other than the residents of Medina urged him to accept the offer, he eventually agreed
 abu mekhanaaf ke mutabikka varnan, talhah pehle pramukh saathi the jinhone 'ali ko apana pratigya di, lekin anya kathaon ne anyathaa daawa kiya ki unhen apni pratigya dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In addition, Talhah and az-zubayr later claimed that they reluctantly supported him
 bhale hi, ali ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya, jor dekar kaha ki unhone unhen sleep swechha se manyata di he
 Wilferd Madelung believes the force did not urge people to pledge and publicly pledged at the mosque
 jabaki madina kii aabaadi ke saath-saath kai vidrohiyon ne apni pratigya di, kuch mahatvapurn aankade yaa janajatiyon ne aisa nahin kiya
 Uthman's relatives fled to the Umayyad Levant, or remained in their homes, later denying 'ali's legitimacy'
 saad ebn abi vakkaas anupasthit the or 'abdulla ebn' umr ne apane nishtha kii peshkash karne se roak diya, lekin donon ne 'ali ko aashwaasan diya ki ve unke khilaaf kaary nahin karenge
 Ali thus inherited the Rashidun Caliphate — which stretched from Egypt in the west to the Iranian hills in the east — while the situation in Hejaz and other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled
 ali khalipha banane ke turant baad, unhone prantiy governron ko khaarij kar diya jinhen uthman ne niyukt kiya tha, unhen bharosemand sahyogiyon ke saath badal diya tha
 He acted against the lawyers of Mugira ibn Shuba and Ibn Abbas, who had carefully advised them to proceed with their rule
 madelang kaa kahana he ki ali apane adhikaar or unke dharmik mishan se gaharaai se aashwast the, raajnneetik yogyata ke liye apane siddhanton se samjhauta karne ke icchhuk nahin the, or baari baadhaon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye taiyaar the
 Mu'awiyah I, the founder of Uthman and the governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; He was the only governor to do so
 hagiya sophia main islamic sulekh ke saath ali kaa naam, jab unhen khalipha niyukt kiya gaya, ali ne madina ke nagarikon se kaha ki muslim raajnneeti asantosh or vivaad se peedit hui he; vah kisi bhi buraai ke islam ko shuddh karnaa chahta tha
 He advised the population to behave as true Muslims, warning that it would not tolerate any treason and that those found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly
 aaisha, talha, al-zubair or umayyadon, vishesh rup se muawiyah i or maravan main, dangaiyon jo maar daalaa tha dandit karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha 'ali uthman
 They camped close to Basra
 vaarta kai dinon tak chali or baad main garam vinimay or parali ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon se uda, jisase donon taraf jivan kii haani hui
 The battle of camels in confusion began in 656, where Ali emerged victorious
 kuch itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unhone is mudde kaa istemaal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko khojane ke liye kiya kyonki unhen ali ke khalipha apane phaayde ke khilaaf mila
 The rebels said that Uthman was executed for not ruling according to the Quran and Sunnah, so no retaliation was to be done
 kuch log kehete hai ki khalipha vidrohiyon kaa uphaar tha or ali ke paas unhen niyantrit karne yaa dandit karne ke liye paryaapt bal nahin tha, jabaki anya kehete hai ki ali ne vidrohiyon ke tark ko sweekaar kiya yaa kam se kam vichaar nahin kiya uthman ek shaasha shaasha
 Under such circumstances, a dispute ensued that started the first civil war in Muslim history
 uthamanion ke naam se jane vaale kuch musalamaanon ne uthman ko ant tak ek sahi or sirf khalipha mana, jise avaidh tareeke se maar diya gaya tha
 Some others, known as Ali's party, believed that Uthman had fallen into error, seized the caliphate and refused to reform or step in their own way legally
 Was executed in law; Thus Ali was just and true Imam and atheists among his opponents
 yah khud ali kii sthiti nahin thi
 This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community who had legitimate authority to occupy the Caliphate
 pratham fitnaa, 656-661, uthman kii hatya ke baad, ali ke khalipha ke dauraan jari rakhaa, or khalipha ke muavia kii dharna dwaara samaapt kiya gaya tha
 This civil war is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic Ummah
 ali ne basra ke governor 'abd allaah ebn al'-abbaas niyukt kiye or iraq main muslim garrison shahar kupha main apni rajdhani chali gai
 After the roman-persian Wars and the Byzantine Sasani War that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep-rooted differences between Iraq, formally in the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire
 iraqi chaahate the ki nae sthapit islamic rajya kii rajdhani kupha main ho taaki ve apane kshetra main rajasav laa saken or syria kaa virodh kar saken
 He convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish a capital at Kufa in Iraq
 baad main levant ke governor muvayah pratham or uthman ke chachere bhai ne ali kii nishtha kii maangon se inkaar kar diya
 Ali opened up hopes of regaining his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule
 muvayah ne apane laventine samarthakon ko sangathit karke or ali ko shradhanjali arpit karne se inkaar kar diya ki unke dal ne apane chunaav main bhaag nahin liya tha
 Ali shifted his forces to the north and the two armies encamped themselves in Siffin for more than a hundred days, most of the time being spent in conversation
 yadhyapi ali ne muvayah ke saath kai patron kaa aadan-pradaan kiya, lekin vah uttararddh ko khaarij karne main asamarth tha, na hi use nishtha dene kaa vachan dene ke liye raji kiya
 a confrontation between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657
 ek saptaah ke yuddh ke baad ek hinsak ladaai ke baad lalit al-harir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, muvayah kii sena margauntarit hone ke bindu par thi jab amrit ebn al-aas ne muvayah ko apane sainikon ko oochhaalane kii salaah di thi 
 Ali watched through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to chase the fight
 aakhir main do senaayen is baat ko sulajhane ke liye sahamat huin ki madhyasthata se khalipha koun hona chahie
 The refusal of the largest block in Ali's army to fight was the deciding factor in the acceptance of arbitration
 sawaal yah he ki kya madhyasth ali yaa kufaan kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa, ali kii sena main aage vibhaajan hua he
 Ashath ibn q and some others rejected Ali's candidates as 'abd Allah ibn' Abbas and Malik al-ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ashari for his neutrality
 ant main, ali ko abu musa ko sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Amrit ibn al-a was appointed by Mu'awiyah as a mediator
 saat maheene baad do madhyasthon ne farvari 658 main jordan main maan ke uttar pashchim main 10 mile uttar pashchim main mulaakaat kii
 Amrit ibn al-abu Musa Ashari assured that both Ali and Mu'awiyah should step in and elect a new caliph
 ali or unke samarthak is faisle se dar gaye the, jisane khalipha ko vidrohi muvayah kii sthiti main kam kar diya tha
 Therefore Ali was called by Mu'awiyah and Amr ibn al-s
 jab daumit-ul-jandal main madhyasthon ne ikattha kiya, to unke liye maamalon kii charchaa karne ke liye dainik baithkon kii ek shrinkhalaa kii vyavastha kii gai
 When it came time to make a decision about the Caliph, Amrit bin al-aas convinced Abu Musa al-ashari to entertain that he should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the Caliphate, and the Muslims to make elections
 The Caliph Abu Musa al-ashari also decided to act accordingly
 punavala ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki madhyasthon ke bahishkaar ke saath madhyasth or anya pratishthit vyaktiyon ne janvari 65 9 main nae khalif ke chayan par charchaa ke liye mulaakaat kii
 Amrit supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter unanimously refused to stand for election
 abu musa ne prastaavit kiya, or amrit sahamat hue, ali or muvayah donon ko chhodane or shura ko nae khalif kaa chayan jamaa karne ke liye sahamat hue
 The public declaration after Abu Musa saw his share of the pact, but Amrit declared Ali and confirmed Muawiya as the Caliph
 ali ne unke faisle ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya or chunaav hone ke liye or madhyasthata kaa paalan karne ke liye apane pratigya kaa ulanghan karne main takneekee rup se paaya
 Ali protested, stating that it was not binding on the contrary to the Quran and Sunnah
 phir usne ek nai sena ko vyavasthit karne kii koshish kii, lekin malik ashtar kii aguai main kurr ke avshesh ansaar, or unke kuch kulon ne vafaadaar bane rahe
 This also put Ali in a vulnerable position among his supporters
 madhyasthata ke parinamswaroop 'ali ke gathbandhan ke vighatan main, or kuch ne kaha he ki yah muvayah kaa iraadaa tha
 The most vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the same people who forced Ali into a ceasefire
 unhone ali ke bal se tod diya, naaraazgi ke tahat raily "madhyasthata akele bhagwaan se sambandhit he
 “this group came to be known as Kharijites
 unhone sabhi ko apana dushman mana
 In 659 Ali's army and Kharijites met at the Battle of Naharvan
 tab kurra kharijiyon ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims
 unhone kisi aise vyakti ko mana jo avishvasi ke rup main apane samooh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Although 'ali won the battle by a large margin, the constant struggle was beginning to affect his position
 iraqiyon se nipatane ke dauraan, ali ko ek anushaasit sena or prabhavi rajya sansthaanon kaa nirmaan karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 He spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites
 natijatan, 'ali ko apane purvi morche par rajya kaa vistaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Around the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt
 misr ke rajyapal, kus ko yaad kiya gaya tha, or ali ne unhen mohammad ebn abi bakar ke saath badal diya tha
 Mu'awiyah allowed 'amrit ibn al' to conquer Egypt and Amrit successfully did so
 amrit ne pehle romanon se atharah saal pehle misr liya tha lekin uthman ne use barkhaast kar diya tha
 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to reunite with 2000 men but they dispersed without fighting
 agle varshon main, muvayah kii sena ne iraq ke kai shaharon par kabja kar liya, jo ali ke governor nahin roak sake, or logon ne unke saath ladane ke liye unka samarthan nahin kiya
 Mu'awiyah defeated Egypt, Hijaz, Yemen and other regions
 ali ke khalipha ke aakhri saal main, kupha or basra main manodasha unke paksh main badal gaya kyonki log muvayah ke shasankaal or nitiyon se bhramit ho gaye
 However, people's attitude towards Ali was profoundly different
 unamem se keval ek choti alpsankhyak kaa maananaa tha ki ali mohammad ke baad sabase acha muslim tha or keval un par shashan karne kaa hakdaar tha, jabaki bahumat ne unhen muvayah ke avishvaas or virodh ke kaaran samarthan diya tha
 Ali is said to have sworn in and forewarned an inconsistent campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges within the caliph's ranks after Uthman was pressed by the public to succeed in the caliphate
 shiyas kaa tark he ki abhijaat varg ke saath apni alokapriyata ke baavjood in sudhaaron ko dhakka dene main unka drudh sankalp amir or paigambar ke visheshadhikaar praapt purv saathi se shatruta kaa kaaran rahaa he
 In a famous letter to his governor Malik Ashtar, he expressed his pro-anti-poor attitude: yaad rakhen ki saamaanya purushon kii naapsand or asweekruti, mahatvapurn vyaktiyon kii sweekruti or kuch bade logon kii naaraazgi se adhik asantulan se adhik logon ko pareshaan nahin kiya jaataa he, yadi aapke vishay ke aam janata or jansampark aapke saath khush hai

 'ali ne uthman dwaara di gai bhoomi ko waapas laayaa or apane chunaav se pehle praapt hue kuch bhi hasil karne ke liye kasam khai
 Ali opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenue, favoring equal distribution of taxes and plunder among Muslim citizens; He distributed the entire revenue of the treasury among them
 'ali ne apane bhai' akel ebn abu talib sahit bhakthivaad se bachanaa
 This was a sign for Muslims of their policy of offering equality to Muslims, who served Islam in its early years and played a role in the subsequent conquest of Muslims
 ali ek vyapak gathbandhan banane main safal rahaa, khaskar oont kii ladaai ke baad 
 His policy of equal distribution of taxes and plunder gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar, who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the Qur'a or Quranic readers who sought pious Islamic leadership

 Although many people at this time were counted as political Shiites, some of them believed in Ali's religious leadership
 misr ke governor kii niyukti ke baad malik al-ashtar ko bheje gaye patr main unki nitiyon or shashan ke vichaar prakat hue hai
 This directive, which has historically been seen as the ideal constitution for Islamic rule with the Constitution of Medina, at that time included a detailed account of the duties and rights of the ruler and various functionaries of the state and the main sections of society
 ali ne malik al-ashtar ko unke nirdeshon main likhaa tha: Since most of Ali's people were nomads and farmers, he was concerned with agriculture

 Ali died on 29 January 661, two days later

 After Ali's death, the Kufi Muslims pledged allegiance to their eldest son, Hassan, without controversy, as Ali had on several occasions declared that the people of the House of Muhammad were entitled to rule the Muslim community

 In this way Mu'awiyah captured the Islamic Caliphate and tuned it into a secular empire

 Apart from Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history that has been written in Islamic languages as Ali
 muslim samskruti main, ali ko unke saahas, gyaan, vishwaas, eemaandaaree, islam ke prati samarpan, mohammad ko gahari vafadari, sabhi musalamaanon ke samaan upachaar or parajeet dushmano ko kshamaa karne main udaartaa ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or isliye rahasyamay paramparaon ke liye centre he islam main sufiwaad jaise
 Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought
 ali lagbhag sabhi sufi adeshon main ucch sthaan rakhata he jo unke madhyam se mohammad ko unke vansh kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Ali's influence has been significant throughout Islamic history
 sunni or shiya vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki vilaah kii kavita ali ke sammaan main sunai gai thi, lekin vilaayah or imamet kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 Sunni scholars believe that the poem is about Ali, but he is not identified as an Imam, in Shia Muslim thought, that Ali was chosen by God as Muhammad's successor
 ali yaa anya shiya imam kaa zikr karte hue shiya vidwaanon dwaara vyakhya kiye gaye kai chand hai
 Answering the question as to why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in the Quran, Muhammad al-baqir answers: "allah revealed salat to his Prophet but never said about the three or four rak'ahs, Revealed Zakat but did not mention its details Haj but its Tawaf and Prophet were not counted
 unhone is kavita kaa khulaasa kiya or paigambar ne kaha ki yah kavita ali, hasan, hossain or baarah imam ke bare main he
 "according to Ali a quarter of Quranic verses are telling the Imam's station
 mamen ne in chhandon main se kai ko shiya islam ke parichay main soochibaddh kiya he
 However, there are some verses that some Sunni commentators interpret in the context of Ali, among which Villah's verse that Sunni and Shiite scholars refer to the incident Ali gave his ring to a beggar who prayed rituals in the mosque Asked the devotees
 mavadda kii kavita chhandon main se ek he, donon sunni or shiyite ne ali ke naam ko kuch anya naamon ke saath joda
 The above verse of Mubhala, and also verse 2: 269 in which Ali is honored with unique knowledge by both Shia and Sunni commentators such verses
 shiya mohammad ke baad ali ko sabase mahatvapurn vyakti maanate hai or vah apni smriti main ek jatil, puranic vyakti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, greatness, honesty, straightforwardness, eloquence and deep knowledge
 ali dharmi tha lekin anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padaa, vah aadhikarik tha lekin dayaalu or vinamr, joardaar lekin marij bhi, siikhaa lekin shramik vyakti bhi tha
 According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death
 yah kai hadison dwaara samarthit he, jinhen shams dwaara sunaaya gaya he, jisamen khum ke talab ke haddees, do bharpurn chizon ke haddees, kalam or paper ke haddees, clok ke haddees, pad ke haddees, nimath ke nimantran kareebi parivaar, or baarah uttaradhikari ke haddees 
 Jafar al-sadiq narrates in the Hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, who would turn away from Allah and his Prophet, under his guidance
 ali swayan varnan karata he ki vah allaah tak pahunchane ke liye pravesh dwaar or paryvekshak he
 According to this view, Ali as Muhammad's heir did not rule the community in justice, but also interpreted Sharia law and its esoteric meaning
 isliye unhen truti or paap se mukt mana jaataa tha, or mohammad ke madhyam se divya decri dwaara bhagwaan dwaara niyukt kiya gaya tha
