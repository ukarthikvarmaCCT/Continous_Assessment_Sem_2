 elizabeth or stuart yug ke naatakon main varnanaatmak anshon, kavita ke aadhiky, swagat, kabhi-kabhi foohad majaak yaa bhandaiti, raktapaat, samasamyik put, yatharthwaad ityadi tatwon ko samajhane ke liye in rangashaalaon kii rachana or unke saamaajikon kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 In individual theater theaters used to be inside the theater where there was good management of light, scene etc
 and it had social elite
 inhone bhi 17veen shatabdi main angreji naatak ke rup ko prabhavit kiya
 These theater not only generated wide interest for plays but also influenced the content and composition of plays, as the playwrights of this era had a living connection to theater and wrote plays only keeping in mind its possibilities and limitations
 
 elizabeth kaa yug angrejon ke itihaas main rashtriya ekta, adamya utsaah, maanavtaavaadi jaagrukta ke utkarsh or mahaan prayatnon kaa tha
 Like other genres of literature, it also influenced drama
 shakespeare sansar ko us yug kii sabase badi saahitiyik dein he, lekin uske atirikt yah anek badi pratibhaaon kaa krititvakaal he
 Robert Green, John Lilly, Tomas Kidd, and Christopher Marlowe, who were called f University Witsf, have a particularly large role in creating the role of that great era, educated in universities and making writing a profession
 green or lily ne geetimay prem or udaar prahasan, kid ne pratihinsaatmak tragedy or marlo ne mahatvakanksha or naitikta ke sangharsh se paidaa hui vishmata kii tragedy ko janm diya
 He gave artistry to the play by mixing Latin and indigenous traditions
 jorge pil or green ne naatakeey atukant kavita kaa vikaas kiya or marlo ne unase aage badhkar use ucchkanth or vegvan banaaya
 The Kathasutra in Marlowe's plays is lax but he is a worthy master of Shakespeare in the lyrical inarticulate expression of fierce conflicts and grandiose picture scheme
 marlo krit temberlen, doctor fasts or 'di jew ov malta' ke nayak apane abaadh vyaktvaad ke kaaran aadhyatmik mulyon se takaraate or tut jate hai
 Thus by portraying the conflict between the individual and society, Marlowe first presents the central problem of the Renaissance that also agitated Shakespeare and other playwrights
 marlo ne angreji naatak ko swarnyug ke dwaar par khadaa kar diya
 William Shakespeare's early development took place within the boundaries of these traditions
 uske praarambhik naatakon main kala main siddhahastata praapt karne kaa praytn he
 Through this initial effort, he confirmed his playwright's personality
 kathanak, charitra-chithran, bhashaa, chand, chitra yojana or jivan kii pakad main uskaa vikaas us yug ke anya naatakakaron kii apeksha adhik shramsadhy tha, lekin 16veen shatabdi ke antim or 17veen shatabdi ke praarambhik varshon main uski pratibha kaa asaadhaaran utkarsh hua
 All cultural and creative abilities of the Renaissance were reflected in the plays of this period
 is tarah shakespeare ne haal or holinshed ke itihaas granthon se england or scotland ke raajaaon kii ore plutark se rome ke shaskaon kii kathaayen leen, lekin unamem usne maanavtaavaadi yug kaa bodh bhar diya
 She imitated Lily and Green in early happy dramas, but 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' and four subsequent works 'the Merchant of Venice', 'much Ado About Nothing', 'twelfth Night' and 'as You Like' In 'it', he gave a new look to romantic comedy in English literature
 inkaa vaataavaran darbari kamedi se bhinn he
 There is a folk where the distinction between dream and reality is erased and where the intellect of humor is also humbled by the generosity of the heart
 'meisur for meisur' or 'aalz wel dait ands wel' main, jo uske antim sukhaant naatak hai, vaataavaran ghaney badalon ke bich chhipate or unase nikalate hue suraj kaa sa he
 The grief plays do not have the tone of defeat despite the death of the hero-heroine in the early period work 'romeo and Juliet'
 lekin 16veen shatabdi ke baad likhe gaye 'hamelet', 'lier', 'athelo', 'macweth', 'aintni and cleopetra' or koreolensaf main us yug ke shadyantrpurn dooshit vaataavaran main maanavtawaad kii paraajay kaa chitra he
 But even in the midst of that, Shakespeare's voice of faith is raised
 ant main anubhutiyon se mukti paane ke liye usne 'pericleas', 'simbelin', 'di winters tail' or 'tempast' likhe jinamein praarambhik durghatnaon ke baavjood ant sukhad hote hai
 Shakespeare is among the world's tiniest talents in vivid knowledge of life and in poetry and theatrical beauty
 ben johnson angreji naatak main 'vikrut' prahasan kaa janmdata he
 His initiation gurus were Platus and Horace, so he is the Acharya playwright and he opposed the coordination of opposing elements in the romantic comedy of Shakespeare etc
 uski fa vikrutif kaa arth tha kisi charitra ke doshavishesh ko atiranjit rup main chitrit karnaa
 Her primary compositions are 'abraman in His Humor' and 'abraman Out of His Humor'
 johnson ke anusaar kamedi kaa kartavya apane yug kaa chitra prastut karnaa or maanav charitra kii moorkhtaaon se 'krida' karnaa tha
 In this way, he also gave birth to the sarcastic realist skit drama in which his famous compositions are 'walpone' and 'alchemist'
 johnson kaa prahasan gudgudaata nahin, dank martha he
 The drama affected the growing instability and despair in society during the reign of James i and the increasing artificiality in the court
 shakespeare ke parvarti webster, turnar, midilaton, mastern chapman, macinger or ford ke duhkhaant naatakon main vyaktvaad aswabhaavik mahatvakankshaon, bhayankar raktapaat or krurta, atmpida or niraashaa main prakat hua
 In Webster's words, his central philosophy is the imperative of the 'narmund at the root of the flowering plants'
 kamedi main midilaton or mainsinger johnson kii parampara main the, lekin unamem sthool prahasan or ashleelata kii bhi vruddhi hui
 In John Palcher and Francis Bommant, the fall of comedy was seen in the form of sad romances, heroic heroines' fictional lives, highly ornate and stereotypical language, and unnatural events, instead of healthy romance or farce
 darbar kii prerana se hi isi yug main mask kaa bhi janm hua jisamen bhavy drishyon or saajasja tathaa sangeet kii pradhanta thi
 At the same time, one of the most famous family problematic grief plays in terms of future development is the famous Arden of Feverschamf, published on the back of what was previously written
 is tarah darbar ke prabhaav main naatak janata se dur ho rahaa tha
 In fact, Boumant and Fletcher's tragi-comedy was performed in private private theater in front of elite socials
 agar naatak kaa janata se jivit sambandh tha to johnson kii shishy parampara ke naatakon ke dwaara yaa shakespeare ke parvarti duhkhaant naatakon ke dwaara, jinka abhinay fa publicf rangashaalaon main hota tha
 The series of development of the English drama broke up in 1642 when all the theater schools were closed in the Commonwealth era under pressure from the Puritan sect
 uskaa punarjanm 1660 main charles dwitiya ke punarrajarohan ke saath hua
 Reconnaissance period: France's court was the ideal of culture for Charles II, who lived as a refugee in the court of Louis Chaturdash in France
 uske saath yah adarsh bhi england aayaa
 French rewriters and playwrights became role models of English playwrights
 charles ke lautne par daüri len or dorset garden kii rangashaalaon kii sthapana hui
 The theater itself was controlled by Charles and Duke of York
 in rangashaalaon ke saamaajik mukhyatah darbari, unki premicaaye, chil-chhabile or kuch aawaragard hote the
 Now the play was of minorities instead of majority; Therefore, in this era two types of plays have grown and developed - one, the plays which were friar-like, and the self-respecting was in favor of the sadistic courtiers; Secondly, the skit which depicted social behaviors of characterless but sharp-witted individuals
 rangashaalaon main drishyon, prakaash ityadi ke prabandh ke kaaran kaanon se zyada aankhon ke madhyam se kaam liya jane laga, jisase elizabeth yug ke naatakon kii shuddh kavita kii anivaaryta jaati rahi
 Women also started to come to the theater, due to which it was possible to put many female characters in the stories
 hiroica tragedy kaa netritv dryden ne kiya
 Such plays were characterized by an exceptionally strong and extremely beautiful heroine in heroic love with extraordinary ability and idealism, an internal conflict between love and self-respect, valor, rhyme, rhetoric and lack of expression and intense and subtle feeling
 dryden kaa anukaran auron ne bhi kiya, lekin unako naganya safalataa mili
 In this period, sad plays were also written in untouched verses and the playwrights had more success than the heroic tragedy
 ye bhi aam taur par prem ke vishay main the
 But his world was different from the fierce conflicts of the Elizabethan era plays
 yahan bhi pradhanta oohatmak bhavukta kii hi thi
 The only notable addition to Dryden is Tomas Autway among such playwrights
 is yug ne naatak ke rup ko ek nai dein fa operaph ke rup main di, jisamen cathopakathan ke atirikt sangeet bhi rahata tha
 The development of the Comedy of Manners revived the English farce drama
 iske prasiddh lekhakon main wiliam vikarli, wiliam congriva, jorge ithrage, jon whonbrug or jorge farkuhaar hai
 He drew a neutral portrait of Johnson in a realistic manner with Charles ii's courtiers such as the populist, the supreme, the apostles of love, the indifferent to the ethics and virtue, and the neat but sharp-bodied men of neutrality
 upadesh yaa samaaj sudhaar unka lakshya nahin tha
 Due to this, these writers are also accused of obscenity
 in naatakon main johnson ke charitron kii maansik vividhta ke sthaan par ghatnaon kii vividhta he
 Like Johnson, he saw characters in their social milieu, not by symbolizing exaggeration in the style of exaggeration
 unka sabase bada kaam yah tha ki unhone angreji kamedi ko bomaant or flechar kii kritrim romani bhavukta se mukt kar use sachche arthon main prahasan banaaya
 As well as Johnson's tradition, Shadwell and Howard continued
 yah shatabdi gairik or shrimati sidans jaise abhinayta or abhinetri kii shatabdi thi, lekin naatak rachana kii drushti se is yug main keval do bade naatakkaar hue: richard binrasale sheridan or oliver goldsmith 
 The middle-class ethics of this century gave rise to emotional comedy in this era, with more emphasis on virtue than farce
 paariwarik sukh, adarsh prem or hriday kii pavitrataa kii sthapana ke liye aksar madhyavargeey charitron ko hi chunaa jaataa tha
 The most famous of such playwrights are Cibber, Steele, Kelly and Cumberland
 sheridan or goldsmith ne aise ashrusinchit sukhaant naatakon ke sthaan par shuddh prahasan ko apana lakshya banaaya
 He followed the exaggeration of Jonson and Congreve in realism, satire, piercing language and characterization in place of romantic elements
 goldsmithkrut fa shi stoops tu kankaraf or sheridan krit fa di skool for scandalaf angreji prahasan natya kii sarvottam kritiyon main gine jate hai
 Many writers wrote sad plays in this century, but Edison's Ph
 Katoff is notable among them
 pantomime, jo ek tarah se shuddh bhandaiti tha or bailad-opera bhi is yug main kaaphi lokapriy the
 Gaye's Geetinatya f the Beggars opera was then performed in many countries of Europe
 edward moore kaa paariwarik samasyamoolak naatak 'gamster' aise naatakon main sabase acha he
 19th century - The first half of the Romantic era is almost zero in terms of drama
 sadi, colorij, bardsworth, shelli, keats, byran, lander or browning ne naatak likhe, lekin adhiktar ve keval padhane laayak hai
 In the second half of the century, Ibsen's influence brought new inspiration to English drama
 paariwarik jivan ko lekar robertson, jones or pinro ne ibson kii yathartwaadee style ke anukaran par naatak likhe
 He did not have Ibsen's talent, but he simplified the way forward with theatricality and modern style
 ibson ke prachaar ne angreji naatak ko nai disha di
 Some of the features of his plays were simple problems of society and the individual; Criticism of old morality; Internal conflicts in place of external conflicts; Realism on theater; Descriptive decor; Boycott of Self; Colloquial proximity; Symbolism
 ibson ke naatak samasya naatak hai
 In addition to Ibsen, Chekhov also had a profound impact on early 20th-century playwrights
 aise naatakakaron main sabase pramukh shaw or galsvardi ke atirikt granbill barker, saint jon hankin, jon messfield, saint jon arvin, ornald benet ityadi hai
 The tradition of comedy of manners has also evolved in this era
 19veen shatabdi ke ant main auskar wild ne isko punarujjivit kiya tha
 Among the leading writers of the 20th century are Shaw, Mom, Lansdale, St
 Erwin, Munro, Noel Coward, Travers, Ratigan, etc

 The most famous of their authors are Sheriff, Milne, Priestley, and John Whon Drayton in addition to The Casey

 Modern English drama owes a great deal to three of Ireland's most famous playwrights, Yates, Lady Gregory and Synge
 yathartwaadee style ke yug main unhone naatak main romani or geetimay kalpana tathaa anubhuti ko kaayam rakhaa
 It is thus clear that English drama has developed multifaceted in the 20th century
 rangamanch ke vikaas ke saath-saath roopon main bhi anek parivartan hue hai
 There may be exaggeration in the evaluation due to conciseness, but the achievements in the era in which playwrights such as Shaw, Garlsardi, o Cassie, Yates, Elliott and Synge have endured

 The work done if the object is displaced d distance in the direction of force by applying f force on an object hoga
 Example: 10 Newton's force is applied on an object in the south direction and if that object is displaced 2 m in the south direction, then the work done by the force is w = = 20 n m = 20 J
 kisi vastu par 5 newton kaa bal lagaakar use 4 meter visthapit karne par bhi 20 j hi kaary hoga 
 The unit of work is 'joule'

 If a fixed force is applied on an object and it moves in a straight line, the work done can be extracted from the following formula- jahaan: But if the value of the force is not fixed and the displacement is not in one direction but in different directions, then in this case the vector product of force and displacement have to be integrated to extract the work volume

 In 2014, Bhoomipujan was performed for the memorial at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin kuch sanghathanon ne smarak ke praaroop ko lekar aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Some organizations, including the Republican Army's Anandraj Ambedkar, demanded that Bhimrao's memorial be raised higher than the Statue of Liberty of America

 There are several methods to purify the impure wing
 vang shwet rang kii komal tanya dhaatu he
 Its strings can be easily pulled, but there is a sound of shriek when the sheet of wang is folded, which is called the shout of the vang
 dhaatu ke do apararupi roopantaran hai
 In the normal state, it is a white colored metal, but if Vang is kept for a longer period of 13 seconds
 When kept below temperature, it turns into a brittle and brown powder, which makes a second appearance of Vanga, which is permanent on the lower side

 It is yellow colored in hot state and white colored material at normal temperature
 vang tanu amlon main dhire dhire ghulkar,, yogic banaata he or hydrogen mukt karata he
 Water containing stannic oxide or metastenic acid is formed by the reaction of concentrated nitric acid on the metal
 vang kshareey vilyan main ghulkar stanet banaata he, jiske falswaroop hydrogen mukt ho jaataa he
 Two types of compounds of vang are known: one stenus, in which vang has valency 2 and the other stanic, in which vang valence is four
 iske do oxide, stans oxai, or stanic oxai,, hote hai
 Stannous sulfide is obtained by heating the vang with sulfur
 stanic salphid bhi banataa he
 Vung stance with halogen makes halide and stannic halide

 landau-ramanujan stambhakaramanujan-soldanar Stambhakaramanujan Theta funljarors-ramanujan Tasamkaramanujan Projacutra Theta Functions shrinivas ramanujan iyangar ek mahaan bhartiya ganitagya the
 He is counted among the greatest mathematics thinkers of the modern period
 inhen ganit main koi vishesh prashikshan nahin mila, phir bhi inhone vishleshan evam sankhya siddhant ke kshetron main gahan yogadan die
 With his talent and dedication, he not only made amazing innovations in the field of Mathematics but also gave India an incomparable pride
 ye bachapan se hi vilakshan pratibhavan the
 He learned mathematics by himself and compiled 3,884 theorems of mathematics throughout his life
 inamen se adhikansh prameya sahi siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 He drew many fundamental and unconventional results on the strength of the intuitive knowledge of mathematics and the unique talent of algebraic hypothesis, which inspired research to date, although some of his discoveries have not yet been adopted into the mathematics mainstream
 haal main inke sutron ko crystal-vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya he
 Ramanujan Journal has been established for the work being done in the areas of mathematics affected by his work
 ramanujan kaa janm 22 disambar1887 ko bharat ke dakshini bhubhag main sthit coimbatore ke erod naamake gaanv main hua tha
 He was born in a traditional Brahmin family
 inaki kii mata kaa naam komaltammal or inke pita kaa naam shrinivas ayyangar tha
 His childhood was spent mainly in Kumbakonam, which is known for its ancient temples
 bachapan main ramanujan kaa bauddhik vikaas saamaanya baalkon jaisaa nahin tha
 He did not even learn to speak until he was three years old
 jab itani badi aayu tak jab ramanujan ne bolnaa aarambh nahin kiya to sabko chintaa hui ki kahin yah gunge to nahin hai
 In later years, when he entered school, he never felt in traditional education
 ramanujan ne das varshon kii aayu main primary pariksha main puure jile main sabase adhik ank praapt kiya or aage kii shiksha ke liye toun hiskool pahunche
 Ramanujan loved asking questions
 unke prashn adhyapakon ko kabhi-kabhi bahut atapate lagate the
 Like - who was the first man in the world? What is the distance between earth and clouds? Ramanujan's behavior was very sweet
 inkaa saamaanya se kuch adhik sthool sharir or jigyaasa se chamakati aakhen inhen ek alag hi pahchaan detii thim
 According to their classmates, their behavior was so gentle that no one could get angry with them
 vidhyalay main inaki pratibha ne duusare vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon par chhap chhodana aarambh kar diya
 He had studied college level mathematics during his school time
 ek baar inke vidhyalay ke pradhanadhyaapak ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vidhyalay main hone vaali parikshaon ke maapdand ramanujan ke liye lagu nahin hote hai
 After passing the high school examination, he received a Subramanian scholarship for scoring good marks in Mathematics and English and also got admission for further college education
 aage ek pareshaani ai
 Ramanujan's love for mathematics had grown so much that he did not pay attention to other subjects
 yahaan tak kii ve itihaas, jeev vigyaan kii kakshaon main bhi ganit ke prashnon ko hal kiya karte the
 As a result, in the eleventh grade examination, he failed in all subjects except mathematics and as a result he stopped getting scholarship
 ek to ghar kii aarthik sthiti kharaab or upar se chaatravrutti bhi nahin mil rahi thi
 This was a very difficult time for Ramanujan
 ghar kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye inhone ganit ke kuch tution tathaa khate-bahi kaa kaam bhi kiya
 Sometime later in 1907 Ramanujan again took the private examination of class XII and failed
 or isi ke saath inke paaramparik shiksha kii itishree ho gai
 The five years after leaving school were very frustrating for him
 bharat is samay paratantraa kii bediyon main jakadaaa tha
 There was severe poverty everywhere
 aise samay main ramanujan ke paas na koi naukari thi or na hi kisi santhaan athwa professor ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka
 His unwavering faith in God and deep reverence for mathematics always inspired him to follow the path of duty
 namgiri devi ramanujan ke parivaar kii isht devi thim
 Unwavering faith in him did not let him stay anywhere and he continued to conduct his research of mathematics even under such adverse circumstances
 is samay ramanujan ko tution se kul paanch rupaye masik milte the or isi main guzaara hota tha
 This life span of Ramanujan was full of grief and sorrow
 inhen hameshaa apane bharan-poshan ke liye or apni shiksha ko jari rakhane ke liye idhar udhar bhatakana padaa or anek logon se asafal yachana bhi kerani padi
 In the year 1908, his parents married him to a girl named Janaki
 vivaah ho jane ke baad ab inke liye sab kuch bhul kar ganit main doobana sambhav nahin tha
 Hence, he came to Madras in search of a job
 barahavin kii pariksha uteern na hone kii vajah se inhen naukari nahin mili or unka swasthya bhi buree tarah gir gaya
 Now on the advice of the doctor, he had to return to his home in Kumbakonam
 beemaari se thik hone ke baad ve waapas madras aae or phir se naukari kii talash shuru kar di
 Whenever he met someone, he used to show him a register of his own
 is register main inke dwaara ganit main kiye gaye saare kaary hote the
 At the same time, at the behest of someone, Ramanujan met Mr
 V
 Ramaswamy Iyer, the deputy collector there
 ayyar ganit ke bahut bade vidwaan the
 Here, Mr
 Iyer recognized the talent of Ramanujan and after asking District Magistrate Mr
 Ramchandra Rao, he also arranged a monthly scholarship of Rs
 25 for him
 is vritti par ramanujan ne madras main ek saal rahete hue apana pratham shodhpatr prakashit kiya
 The title of the research paper was "some properties of Bernoulli numbers" and this research paper was published in Journal of Indian Mathematical Society
 yahaan ek saal puraa hone par inhone madras port trust main clerk kii naukari kii
 Fortunately, there was not much work load in this job and here they used to get enough time for their mathematics
 yahaan par ramanujan raat bhar jaag kar nae-nae ganit ke sutara likhaa karte the or phir thodi der tak aaraam kar ke phir daftar ke liye nikal jate the
 Ramanujan used to write mathematics research on slate
 or baad main use ek register main likh lete the
 At night the sleep of other members of the family was disturbed due to the sound of Ramanujan's slate and pillar
 is samay bhartiya or pashchimi rahan sahan main ek badi duuri thi or is vajah se saamanytah bharatiyon ko angrej vaigyanikon ke saamne apane baton ko prastut karne main kaaphi sankoch hota tha
 The situation here was such that research work could not be carried forward without the help of an English mathematician
 is samay ramanujan ke puraane shubhachintak inke kaam aae or in logon ne ramanujan dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko landan ke prasiddh ganitagyon ke paas bheja
 But here they did not get any special help but one benefit was that people had come to know Ramanujan a little bit
 isi samay ramanujan ne apane sankhya siddhant ke kuch sutara professor sheshu ayyar ko dikhaae to unka dhyaan landan ke hi professor hardi kii taraf gaya
 Professor Hardy was one of the world's famous mathematicians of the time
 or apane sakht swabhaav or anushaasan priyata ke kaaran jane jate the
 After reading Professor Hardy's research work, Ramanujan said that he has found the answer to the unanswered question of Professor Hardy
 ab ramanujan kaa professor hardi se patravyavhaar aarambh hua
 From here on, a new era in Ramanujan's life began in which Professor Hardy had a very big role
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to jis tarah se ek johari heere kii pahchaan karata he or use taraash kar chamakaa detaa he, ramanujan ke jivan main vaisaa hi kuch sthaan professor hardi kaa he
 Professor Hardy was an admirer of Ramanujan's life and philosophy of life
 ramanujan or professor hardi kii yah mitrataa dono hi ke liye laabhprad siddh hui
 In a way, both of them worked complementary to each other
 professor hardi ne us samay ke vibhinn pratibhashali vyaktiyon ko 100 ke paimaane par aanka tha
 He gave 35 marks to most mathematicians and 60 marks to some specific persons
 lekin unhone ramanujan ko 100 main puure 100 ank die the
 Initially, when Ramanujan sent his research work to Professor Hardy, at first he did not even understand
 jab unhone apane mitra ganitagyon se salaah lee to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki ramanujan ganit ke kshetra main ek durlabh vyaktitv he or inke dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko thik se samajhane or usamen aage shodh ke liye unhen england aana chahie
 So he invited Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 kuch vyaktigat kaarnon or dhan kii kami ke kaaran ramanujan ne professor hardi ke cambridge ke aamantran ko asweekaar kar diya
 Professor Hardy was disappointed by this but somehow decided to call Ramanujan there
 isi samay ramanujan ko madras vishvavidhyalay main shodh vritti mil gai thi jisase unka jivan kuch saral ho gaya or unako shodhakarya ke liye puraa samay bhi milane laga tha
 Meanwhile, after a long correspondence, slowly, Professor Hardy agreed Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 professor hardi ke prayaason se ramanujan ko cambridge jane ke liye aarthik sahaayta bhi mil gai
 Ramanujan had written over 3000 new sources of mathematics in his notebook before leaving for England
 ramanujan ne landan kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Professor Hardy had already arranged for him there, so he did not face any particular problem
 england main ramanujan ko bas thodi pareshaani thi or iskaa kaaran tha unka sharmila, shant swabhaav or shuddh satvik jeevancharya
 Throughout his stay in England, he mostly cooked his own food
 england kii is yatra se unke jivan main krantikari parivartan aayaa
 He, along with Professor Hardy, published high-quality research papers
 apane ek vishesh shodh ke kaaran inhen cambridge vishvavidhyalay dwaara bi
e
 kii oopaadhi bhi mili
 But the climate and living style there was not very favorable to him and his health started deteriorating
 doctoron ne ise kshay rog bataaya
 At that time there was no tuberculosis medicine and the patient had to stay in the sanatorium
 ramanujan ko bhi kuch dinon tak vahaan rahanaa padaa
 Even at this time, he used to make new imaginations in the mathematical formulas
 iske baad vahaan ramanujan ko royal socity kaa phelo namit kiya gaya
 At a time when India was living in slavery, it was a great thing for a black person to get membership of the Royal Society
 royal socity ke puure itihaas main inase kam aayu kaa koi sadsy aaj tak nahin hua he
 His well-wishers celebrated and held gatherings all over India
 royal socity kii sadsyta ke baad yah triniti college kii fellowship paane vaale pehle bhartiya bhi bane
 Now it seemed that everything was going to a very good place
 lekin ramanujan kaa swasthya girtaa ja rahaa tha or ant main doctoron kii salaah par unhen waapas bharat lautnaa padaa
 On coming to India, he got a professor job at Madras University
 or ramanujan adhyaapan or shodh kaary main punah ram gaye
 Even after returning to India, health did not support them and the condition was getting serious
 is beemaari kii dasha main bhi inhone mock theta function par ek ucch stareey shodhpatr likhaa
 This function, propounded by Ramanujan, is used not only in mathematics but also in medical science to understand cancer
 inkaa girtaa swasthya sabake liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya or yahaan tak kii ab doctoron ne bhijawab de diya tha
 Finally, the moment of Ramanujan's departure arrived
 26 april1920 ke praatah kaal main ve achet ho gaye or dopaher hote hote unhone praan tyaag die
 At this time Ramanujan's age was only 33 years
 inkaa asamay nidhan ganit jagat ke liye apurnty kshati tha
 Whoever heard the news of Ramanujan's death in the whole country and abroad was shocked
 ramanujan or inke dwaara kiye gaye adhikansh kaary abhi bhi vaigyanikon ke liye abujh paheli bane hue hai
 In his journey to surprise the whole world by taking birth in a very common family, he gave India unprecedented glory
 inkaa unka vah purana register jis par ve apane prameya or sutron ko likhaa karte the 1976 main achaanak triniti college ke pustkaalay main mila
 This register of about one hundred pages remains a puzzle for scientists even today
 is register ko baad main ramanujan kii note book ke naam se janaa gaya
 It has also been published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai
 ramanujan ke shodhon kii tarah unke ganit main kaam karne kii style bhi vicitra thi
 He sometimes woke up in the middle of the night by writing mathematics formulas on the slate and then falling asleep
 is tarah aisa lagata tha ki ve sapane main bhi ganit ke prashn hal kar rahe hon
 Along with Ramanujan's name, his Kuldevi is also taken
 inhone shunya or anant ko hameshaa dhyaan main rakhaa or iske antarsambandhon ko samajhane ke liye ganit ke sutron kaa sahaara liya
 There was a specialty of Ramanujan's work
 pehle ve ganit kaa koi nayaa sutara yaa prameny pehle likh dete the lekin uski upapatti par utana dhyaan nahin dete the
 When asked about this, he used to say that he received this sutra by the grace of Namagiri Devi
 ramanujan kaa aadhyatm ke prati vishwaas itnaa gaharaa tha ki ve apane ganit ke kshetra main kiye gaye kisi bhi kaary ko aadhyatm kaa hi ek ang maanate the
 He not only believed in religion and spirituality but also presented it logically
 ve kehete the ki "mere liye ganit ke us sutara kaa koi matlab nahin he jisase mujhe aadhyatmik vichaar na milte hon
 " ramanujan ne england main paanch varshon tak mukhyatah sankhya siddhanth ke kshetra main kaam kiya
 Ramanujan gave the following formula - is sutara kii visheshta yah he ki yah ganit ke do sabase prasiddh niyatankon kaa sambandh ek anant satat bhinn ke madhyam se vyakt karata he
 He also gave another formula for pie - 'ramanujan sankhya' us prakritik sankhya ko kehete hai jise do alag-alag prakaar se do sankhyaon ke ghanon ke yoga dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 Example - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9 ^ {3} + 10 ^ {3} = 1 ^ {3} + 12 ^ {3} = 1729}
 isi prakaar, Hence Ramanujan numbers are 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 etc

 The Julian calendar was introduced in 45 BC replacing the earlier Roman calendar
 In the Julian calendar as in the Gregorian calendar an ordinary year is 365 days long and a leap year is 366 days long

 The Gregorian calendar uses a more complex algorithm to more closely approximate the length of the tropical year

 Khurd and Kalan are Persian language words found in many contexts in Hindi and in the Indian subcontinent, especially in place names
 "kurd" kaa matlab "chota" hota he or "kalaan" kaa matlab bada hota he
 These names have been used since Mughal times
 choti aabaadi vaale gaanvon-kasbon ke peeche khurd shabd lagaaya gaya
 This Persian word means small
 yah khurd sanskrit ke kshudra se hi bana he jisamen laghu, chota yaa sookshmata kaa bhav he
 There are thousands of Khurd dhari villages across the country
 isi tarah kai gaanvon ke saath kalam shabd judaa miltaa he jaise kosi kalam, baamaniyaan kalam 
 Just as the word khurd became synonymous with small or small, similarly the word kalan became synonymous with big or huge
 kalam kaa prayog lagbhag usee arth main hota tha jaise bharat ke liye prachinkaal main brihattar bharat shabd kaa prayog hota tha jisamen burma se lekar iran tak kaa samoochaa bhushetra aata tha
 However, a word like Hindustan Kalan is not found in any travelogue
 greater britain kii baat chalati thi to uske upniveshon kaa sandarbh nihit hota tha
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Kalan is also important in the context of rural populations
 kalam multah farsi kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab hota he varisht, bada, deergh yaa vishaal
 However, its etymology is unknown
 kuch sandarbhon main ise semetic bhashaa parivaar kaa bataaya jaataa he or ise ishwar kii mahanata se joda jaataa he
 This is fine on the basis of Kalan's economy, but it is not confirmed by any Semitic metal
 kalam shabd kaa prayog sirf sthanon kaa rutaba bataane ke liye hi nahin hota tha balki vyaktiyon ke naam bhi hote the jaise mirza kalam yaa amir kalam al bukhari jiskaa matlab bukhaara kaa mahaan amir hota he
 Obviously, the word Kalan means great here

 Many such rural settlements number in the thousands
 isi tarah kisi gaanv ke vishisht darje ko dekhte hue uske saath jaagir shabd laga diya jaataa tha
 This means that from the annual revenue collection, the part of that village will not go into the government treasury or it will get partial exemption
 mughalon ke daur main prabhavi vyaktiyon ko athwa puraskaar swaroop saamaanya varg ke logo ko bhi gaanv jaagir main diye jate the
 But to distinguish it from other villages of the same name, the newly created vassals used to add jagirs to them like Hinautia and Hinautia Jagir
 uttar bharat, pakistan or afghanistan main kai aise gaanv, shahar or mohalle hai jo ek jagah shuru hue or phir falkar unke do hisse ho gaye - ek mukhya yaa bada hissaa or ek chota hissaa
 In this case, "kalan" came to be called behind the name of the big part and "khurd" behind the small part

 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire

 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization

 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations

 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people

 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions

 That society was divided into three classes / states

 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority

 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable

 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is

 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative

 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi

 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote

 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages

 This is how the revolution started

 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge

 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror

 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished

 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution

 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history

 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i

 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries

 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the

 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation

 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself

 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself

 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha

 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
