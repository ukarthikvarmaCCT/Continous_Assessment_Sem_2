 Of course God i pray for your family, who has created you and those who were before you, be no stranger, you become a sparring who made a land for you and a roof to the sky and rained water from the sky
 Make hawk fruits for your food, do not make anyone a god, even though you know well, and if you people are so ignorant of this act that we have taken away Lying in A
 PS If you are truthful you create a chapter that except Bring Khuhda Also call them your helpers too

 Of course he is very sorry and when you told Moses, o Moses, we will not believe you till we see God clearly
 You were electrocuted by that and you continued to squirm, then after you died, we raised the district so that you would thank you and we overshadowed you and brought down your mind and salvation
 And eat the spicy and nutritious rosaries that you have given them, and those people did not spoil us any more, but they took a beating on their lives and when we told you to go to this village and eat in it wherever you want and eat at the door While doing and saying Hitta Bakshish to the tongue, we will give you this credit and we will increase the righteousness of those who do good, then the body changed what was said to them Then canceled starting another thing to say we had looked prank on them Because of their malfeasance, the sky rose, and when Moses asked for water for his demise, we said, hit your stick on the stone, twelve glasses came out of it and all the people knew their ghat well and we gave the general permission
 That you should eat and drink from the God given life, and then do not get into trouble in the country
 When you told Moses, o Moses, you will not be able to eat from us, you pray for us from your family
 That things grow out of the ground like greens, greens and cucumber and wheat or produce lentils and onions instead
 Do you want to change something that is better in every way than adna cheese, then get off in a city, then your All that you have asked for is present and they were beaten by the Russians and Mohtaji, and those people turned their back towards God, All this happened due to the fact that they denied the signs of God and undeservedly martyred the Prophets and because of that they used to dislike and sobriety, of course Muslims and Jews and Nusranis and Lamazhabas who are God and Rozah At last, Iman will be brought and if he keeps on doing good work, then for his sake, his soul and soul are with his God and neither will anyone be afraid of him nor will he be heartbroken and When we took you away from you and we hanged your head with a turf and said that you should keep holding on to what we have given to you and remember what is in it so that you become a spartan then after that you go again
 If God had not given you the blessings and grace, you would have incurred a heavy loss and by your demise you know the condition of those people who have passed their limits on the day of Shambe
 We told them that you become a monkey were Rainde PS We have this Wakhye For the people who had been in front of them and who were to come after them, they had done wonders for the sake of the abstinence, and when Moses told his people that God commanded you to ask a man to sing what he started saying
 You plead with us, Moses said, i ask for shelter from God that i should be goth, pray for your God to tell us how the cow should be
 Moses said of course God Has Frmata that he is much older Neither cow or heifer rather the average graduate from them, The person who ordered you to play the music, he started saying that you pray to your God to tell us what its color is
 Moses said, Of course, God proves that the cow is very dark, it is very happy to see him
 When we are done, then you say that you pray to your God that you should tell us how much it is and if the cow mixes in the cows and God wants it, then we will definitely find out
 Moses said Uhda sure Frmata that it is not the cows not so Sdhai that land Jothe not cultivate Sichen well healed that there are no blur of color, he said now the exact statement, Pity those people did that cow Halal, although they did not expect them to do so and when a person was killed and there was a split in you, they started telling each other what you were hiding
 We said that take a piece of that cow and kill it, so God makes the dead alive and shows you the traces of his nature so that you understand then after that your The stones were hardened as if they were of stone or even more powerful because the hawks in the stones are such that the canals are released from them and the hawks are such that they crack and water comes out of them and the hawk The stones are such that they fall from the fear of God and they are not guilty of what you are doing, do you have the greed that they will believe you, however they There was a gang of people that used to narrate the story of God and after understanding it well He used to turn around even though he knew well and when we meet people who believe then they say that we have believed and when they have betrayed them, they say that whatever God has i have revealed to you what you will tell so that you can bring honor to your God tomorrow, do you not understand that much, but do those people not know what those people hide Or reveal that God knows everything and some of them are illiterate that they do not understand the books of God other than what they mean, and they do the right things, i like the people who write the book with their own hands, then they are from God so that they can get a little price from it, i regret that their hands have written and then they regret that such earnings Do and say that even after a few days of counting, we will not touch fire, tell these people if you have taken any contract from God, then somehow he is against his property
 Do not do or understand, i add bogey to God
 Yes, those who have achieved evil and their sins have surrounded it from all around, the same people are shocked and they will always be there and those who are honest and have done good deeds
 The same people know that they will always live in paradise, and when we took Ahad and scale from the created Israel, it is better not to pray to anyone except God and the parents and the warlords and the jatim Get along well with people and people and talk well with people Doing and reciting equal prayers and giving zakat, then some of you went back apart from the men and you are the only people who have turned away from the land and when we had prayed to you not to live in harmony and not to spoil our people
 You had denied it and you also testify about it, then you are the same people who kill each other and become unarmed and forcefully support each other from their own groups
 You make the city bad, if the same people come to you as prisoners, then they redeem them, though their removal was forbidden to you, then do you believe in hawks and deny the hawk in you? Those who do this should be punished for nothing but a life-long ruse, and be returned to a hard day on the Day of Judgment and whatever you do, you will be disgusted with it
 It is not these people who buy the life of the world instead of last Not only will they be tested in their wonders, nor will they be given any help and it is a matter of fact that we have given the book to Moses and after that many prophets should take their steps and accept Jesus' son Jesus And provided the light and helped them through Pakistan's spirit, have you become so disgraceful that when a prophet has a hook against you, your wishes and blessings i brought you to the air, then you stubbornly defied the hawk prophets and killed the hawk, and started saying that our hearts are covered with guilt, but because of their kufr, God has cursed them
 And when they have a book from God, which also satisfies them
 Take steps and give merry and light to Mary, son of Mary, and help them through Pakistan spirit Jibreel, have you become so disgraceful that when a prophet came to you with a dictate against your wishes, Nisfani, you swagger When you sat down, you defied the hawk prophets and killed the hawk, and started saying that we have a grudge against our hearts but because of their kufr God has cursed them, very few people believe and when they have a book with God, who also adores them

 The Students of SRCC proudly call themselves srites
 Prominent srites include: Vajjika is the language of the region of North Bihar where Lord Mahavira and Buddha had their birthplace and karmabhoomi and was the first republican kingdom of Vajjinga
 at: vajjika kii pracheenta evam garima vaishali ganatantr ke saath judi hui he or shaayad iskaa patan bhi vaishali ke patan ke saath hi saath hi gaya
 This language has survived only in the folk lore, not in the form of written literature
 yaa aisa bhi sambhav he ki iskaa likhit sahitya vinasht ho gaya ho, jaisaa praakrit apbhransh ke bahuterey granthon ke saath hua
 The philosophy of the form of Vajjika can be seen from buddhist-jain literature to saints
 is bhashaa ke swatantra astitv kii ore sanket karanevaale rahul sankrutyaayan the, jinhone apane lekh "maatrubhaashaon kii samasya" main bhojpuri, maithili, magahi or angika ke saath-saath vajjika ko hindi ke antargat janapadiya bhashaa ke rup main sweekrut kiya 
 Grierson sometimes called it "western Maithili", sometimes "maithil Bhojpuri"
 grearsan ne sthool drushti se vajjika ke kriyaapadon main "chha" dekhakar ise maithili samaj liya
 But there is a difference in this verb of Vajjika and Maithili; Like - Avi rahal, good abichhi and where this verb is used in past and present tense in Maithili there only in present day in Vajjika
 phir, kriyaapadon kaa chayukt rup se bhinn rup dekhakar unhone bhojpuri maan liya
 But where did they know that the Bhojpuri language has the plural sense chihra or the suffix ni, nah, but in vajjika the word "ni" is used instead of ni and the other two signs are not found at all
 phir ve aage likhte hai - "maine seven grammers ov di bihari langwageej, bhaag do main ise bhojpuri kaa ek bhed bataaya tha, kintu vartmaan surveykshan main ise maithili kii vibhaasha isliye bataa rahaa hoon ki jis kshetra main vah boli jaati he vah aitihaasik drushti se pracheen mithila rajya ke antargat he
 " dow jayakaanth mishra or dow udaynarayan tiwari ne kramash: maithili or bhojpuri main chaar-chaar roopon ko sweekaar kiya he- atihrasv, hrasv, atideergh, deergh; jaise ghor, ghora, ghorava or ghorua
 But both hyperthermia and long-form are not found in Vajjika
 is prakaar is bhashaa kii prakruti parvarti bhashaaon ke saath kuch mail khate hue bhi ekadam bhinn he
 While acknowledging the independent existence and power of this language, Jagdishchandra Mathur and Ganesh Chaubey have even said that Tharu language is also Vajjika
 dow siyaaraam tiwari ke anusaar vajjika kshetra ke uttar main nepal, dakshin main ganga nadi, pashchim main saaran or champaran ke bhaag or purv main darbhanga jila he
 In this language some compositions of Gayaadhar, Haldar Das, Mangniram etc
 have been received, from where the literature of Vajjika language starts

 They were residents of Vaishali and went to Tibet for the promotion of Buddhism

 vah vijay kii bahan shiksha ko bandi bana letaa he or uski saare aam bikwaali karata he

 aisa karke vah apane parivaar ke waapas kareeb aa jaataa he jisane use lala ke saath haath milaane par rishta tod liya tha

 At the time when the prince was planning to buy land on the outskirts of Vienna for his Belvedere project, the area was completely undeveloped - an ideal place to build a landscaped garden and summer palace
 haalanki, ek maah pehle rajkumaar ne shahi grand marshall count henrik franj mansfield, pondi ke rajkumaar kaa apana adhigrahan kiya tha, pados ke bhukhndon ko kharida tha or apni jameen par ek udyaan mahal banane ke liye hildebrant ko adhikrut kiya tha
 In order to purchase the plot, Prince Eugene was forced to take a large loan against his Stadpalais on bail, Stadpalais was still in the process of construction

 While the upper Belvedere was transformed into a picture gallery, in the late eighteenth century the lower Belvedere mainly helped members of the palace's family escape Napoleon
 Most notably these included Mary Antoinette and Louis xvi's only surviving offspring, Princess Marie Therese Charlotte and Archduke Ferdinand
 Marie Thérèse Charlotte lived in Teh Palace in 1799 at the time of her marriage to Prince Louise Antoine, Duke of Angoleme

 After the Habsburg monarchy ceded Tyrol to Bavaria at the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, a new palace was to be discovered for the royal collection from the Ambras palace near Innsbruck
 sabase pehle, sangrah ko francisi sainikon dwaara lut liye jane se bachaane ke liye ise petrovradin le jaaya gaya tha
 In 1811, Emperor Francis i ruled that it should be installed in the lower Belvedere, which was actually too small for this collection
 is prakaar belvadar ke is hisse ko bhi ek sangrahalay ke kaam main le liya gaya or isane vienna kii congress ke samay tak kaaphi sankhya main paryatakon ko apni ore aakarshith karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Under the directorship of the Inspector of the Imperial Court Library, Moritz, Count of daitrichschen-proskau-leslie, a collection of archaeological objects from Egypt and antiquities, was added to the lower Belvedere collection after 1833 with the Ambras collection
 
 1844 main roman milastons ko, jise us samay tak thesius mandir ke tahkhaanon main sangrahit kiya gaya tha, inhen privi garden main ek khuli hawa ke sthaan par sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 The young Carl Gable's watercooler bears testimony to the beginning of the lower Belvedere as a museum, similar to Joseph Bergemann's explanatory guidelines for the collection dating back to 1846
 yah sthiti 1888-89 main ringstrese main navnirmit kunsthistorisches sangrahalay main sthanantaran tak lagbhag aparivartit rahi
 After the transfer of the royal collection both the Belvedere palaces were closed as public museums for at least some time

 Template: Imperial and Royal residences ganit main samaan agyaat raashi vaale raikhik samikarnon ke samucchy ko raikhik samikarnon kaa nikaay kaha jaataa he
 for example, teen char raashiyon x, y, z main teen samikarnon kaa ek nikaay he
 Putting numerical values in place of the variables of a linear body satisfies all those equations simultaneously, that set of numbers is called the 'solution of the equation body'
 upar die gayi samikarnon ke nikaay kaa hal yah he: Because these values of x, y, and z satisfy the above three equations
 "nikaay" is baat kaa sanket karata he ki sabhi samikarnon ko ek saath vichaar karnaa he, alag-alag nahin
 Solving the body of linear equations is one of the oldest works of mathematics
 bahut se kshetron kii samasyaon ko hal karte samay raikhik sameekaran nikaay se saamana hota he
 Such as numerical signal processing, linear optimization
 araikhik ganitiya samasyaon ke rekhikaran se bhi raikhik sameekaran nikaay praapt hota he
 To solve these, the Gauss deletion method can be solved efficiently by Cholesky decomposition or LU decomposition

 This matrix is called multiplication
 isi prakaar agyaat raashiyon ko ek vector matrix ke rup main liya jaataa he tathaa sameekaran main aaye sabhi char-viheen padon ko bhi vector matrix b ke rup main liya jaataa he
 But while solving equations etc
, all equations need not be written with unknown amounts
 vastav main sari ganitiya sankriyaayein a or b par hi kii jaatin he
 Therefore, it is more appropriate to write the amplified coefficient matrix by working together and working with them
 pravardhit gunank avyuuh neeche likhaa he: In 1750, Kramer suggested a direct method for solving a body of linear equations
 yah gunank matrix ke vyutkraman par aadhaarit he
 Let n be the solution of a linear equation body with unknown quantities
 matrix rup main likhane par yah sameekaran nikaay is prakaar he: According to Kramer's rule, the value of xi { \ displaystyle x_ {i}} will be derived from the following formula: jahaan a i { \ displaystyle A_{i}} vah matrix he jo a { \ displaystyle A} ke i'wein kollam ke sthaan b { \ displaystyle b} ke avyavon ko rakhane se praapt hoti he

 unani vichaarak arestu ko raajnneeti vigyaan kaa pitamah kaha jaataa he
 Plato's idealism and Aristotle's rationalism are included in Greek thought
 raajnneetishastra yaa raajnneeti vigyaan atyant pracheen vishay he
 Initially it was not accepted as an independent subject
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan nitishastra, darshanashastra, itihaas, evam vidhishastra aadi kii avadharanaon ke aadhaar par hi karne kii parampara thi
 In modern times, it was not only accepted as an independent subject, but also developed well in the context of social sciences
 raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan aaj ke sandarbh main pehle kii apeksha ek ore jahaan atyadhik mahatvapurn he vahiin duusari ore vah atyant jatil bhi he
 The importance of political science is revealed by the fact that today the study of political process is necessary to understand both national and international politics
 prakriya ke adhyayan se hi vaastavik raajnneeti evam unke bheetar avasthit tathyon kaa gyaan sambhav he
 The complexity of political science is linked to their overlapping form and the nature and nature they generate
 aaj raajnneeti vigyaan ’raajnneetik’ va gaiyr raajnneetik donon prakaar ke tatwon se sambandhit he
 Political elements directly govern the political process and from this point of view, under political science, the study of state government, government institutions, electoral system and political behavior is done
 gaiyr raajnneetik tatv apratyaksh rup se raajnneetik prakriya ko chalaane main yogadan dete hai or is kaaran raajnneeti kii sahi samaj inako samanvit karke hi praapt kii ja sakati he
 For this purpose, in political studies, adequate importance is given to the supporting elements like society, economy, religion, culture, geography, science and technology, psychology and history
 unani vichaarkon ke samay se lekar aadhunik kaal tak ke vibhinn chintakon, siddhanthavettaon or vishleshkon ke yogadanon se raajnneeti vigyaan ke rup, adhyayan saamagree evam uski paramparaaye samay-samay par parivartit hoti rahi hai
 Accordingly, this subject has been continuously developing
 is vikascram main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke sambandh main do pramukh drushtikonon kaa udai hua he : paramparaagat drushtikon evam aadhunik drushtikon
 The traditional or traditional approach introduces state-precedence while the modern approach is process-dominant
 isa purv chhathi sadi se 20veen sadi main lagbhag dwitiya mahayuddh se purv tak jis raajnneetik drushtikon kaa prachlan rahaa he, use adhyayan suvidha kii drushti se 'paramparaagat raajnneetik drushtikon' kaha jaataa he
 It is also called idealistic or classical approach
 paramparaagat raajnneetik siddhant ke nirmaan va vikaas main anek raajnneetik vichaarkon kaa yogadan rahaa he yatha- plato, arestu, siciro, sant agastin, equinas, lock, ruso, montescue, kant, hegal, green aadi
 Even in the modern era, many scholars are considered supporters of the traditional view, such as Leo Strauss, Eric Vogolin, Ocott, Hannah Arent, etc
 pracheen yunaan va rome main raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye darshanashastra, nitishastra, tarkshastra, itihaas va vidhi kii avadharanaon ko aadhaar banaaya gaya tha kintu madhyakaal main mukhyatah isai dharamshastreey drushtikon ko raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The Renaissance movement in the 16th century gave rise to intellectual political consciousness as well as the concept of nation-state
 18 veen sadi kii audyogic kranti ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke vikaas ko nai gati pradaan kii
 The glorious revolution of England, the democratic revolutions of France and America developed the traditional political theory as 'liberal democratic political theory'
 paramparaagat raajnneetik drushtikon ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye mukhyatah darshanik, taarkik naitik, aitihaasik va vidhik paddatiyon ko apanaaya he
 Since the 19th century it has placed special emphasis on legal, constitutional, institutional, descriptive and comparative methods
 20veen sadi ke prarambh se hi paramparaagat drushtikon ne raajnneetik siddhanth ke nirmaan ke liye ek nai drushti apanaai jo ateet kii tulana main adhik yathartwaadee thi
 In traditional political science, the practice outside the government and its statutory organs emphasized the study of socio-political facts affecting the policies and decisions of the government
 raajnneetik dal evamdababasamoohon ke saath-saath aupchaarik sanghathanon ke adhyayan par bal diya
 It also emphasized the study of social, economic conditions and movements which are clearly outside the formal organization of the government but affect its policies and programs
 ’raajnneeti’ kaa paryaayavachi angreji shabd 'politics' unani bhashaa ke 'polis' shabd se bana he jiskaa arth 'nagar’ athwa ’rajya’ he
 In ancient Greece, each city was organized as an independent state, and the term politics reflected the learning of the governance related to those city states
 dhire-dhire nagar rajyon kaa sthaan rashtriya rajyon ne le liya atah raajnneeti bhi rajya ke vistrut rup se sambandhit vidya ho gai
 In the modern era, when the world is leaning towards scientific and systematic study of every subject, the study of subjects related to the state is called political science or political science
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke vidwaanon ne raajnneeti vigyaan kii bhinn-bhinn paribhaashae di hai
 These definitions can be interpreted under the following headings: - raajnneeti vigyaan rajya kaa adhyayan he- anek raajnneetishastriyon kii manyata he ki pracheen kaal se hi raajnneeti vigyaan rajya naamak sanstha ke adhyayan kaa vishay he
 Scholars believe that from ancient times to modern times, the state has been the 'central element' of political science
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan main rajya kaa hi adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 According to the famous political scientist Blunshli, political science is the science which is related to the state and it tries to understand what is the basic element of the state, what is its essential form, what are its various forms of expression and its development
 How did it happen
 ’ german lekhak garis kaa kathan he ki raajnneeti shaastra main, shakti kii sanstha ke rup main, rajya ke samast sambandhon, uski utpatti, uske moort rup, uske prayojan, uske naitik mahatv, uski aarthik samasyaon, uske astitv kii avasthaaon uske vittiya pahalu, uddheshy aadi par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Dr
 Garner, "political science begins and ends with the state
" ’’ doctor jakaaria kaa kathan he ki ’’raajnneeti shaastra vyavasthit rup main un aadharbhoot siddhanton kaa nirupan karata he jinke anusaar samshti rup main rajya kaa sanghathan hota he or prabhusatta kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 ' uparyukt sabhi paribhaashaon se spasht he ki raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kendriya vishay rajya he
 The reason for this is the belief that since the time of Plato and Aristotle, the existence of the state is for the achievement of some sacred goals
 raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar kaa adhyayan he - kuch raajnneetishastriyon kii raay main raajnneeti vigyaan main rajya kaa nahin apitu sarkaar kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 They believe that the state is a special organization of human beings and its functional expression is through the government
 unka tark he ki rajya ek amoort sanrachana he jabaki sarkaar ek moort evam pratyaksh sanstha he or sarkaar hi samprabhutaa kaa prayog karti he
 Government is the device of the state by which its purpose and purpose are converted into action
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan main sarkaar kaa hi adhyayan hona chaiye
 According to Seele, "political science researches the elements of governance in the same way that property science deals with property, biology of life, arithmetic numbers and geometry of space and length
" ’’ leacock ne is sandarbh main sankshipt evam sargarbhit paribhaasha di he- ‘‘raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar se sambandhit shaastra he
 '' raajnneeti vigyaan rajya evam sarkaar donon kaa adhyayan he- paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke kuch vidwaanon kii manyata he ki keval rajya yaa keval sarkaar kii drushti se di gai paribhaashae apurna hai
 In fact, the state and the government have a close relationship and in the absence of any one of them, the other cannot be studied
 yadi rajya amoort sanrachana he to sarkaar ise moort va bhautik rup pradaan karti he tathaa isi prakaar yadi rajya prabhusatta ko dhaaran karne vaala he to sarkaar us prabhusatta kaa upbhog karti he
 Hence, both of these should be studied under political science
 paul janet ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan saamaajik vigyaanon kaa vah ang he jisamen rajya ke aadhaar tathaa sarkaar ke siddhanton par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Dimock, political science is related to the state and its means to the government
 ’’ gilakraist ne sankshipt paribhaasha dete huye kaha he ki ’’raajnneeti vigyaan rajya va sarkaar kii saamaanya samasyaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 '' raajnneeti vigyaan maanav tatv ke sandarbh main adhyayan he- kuch raajnneetishastri uparokt paribhaashaon ko purna nahin maanate kyonki in paribhaashaon main maanav tatv kii upeksha kii gai he
 They believe that the study of the state or government is aimless and insignificant without human beings, because they have been created for the benefit of human beings, so the study of human elements is mandatory
 professor laski kii anusaar ‘‘raajnneeti shaastra ke adhyayan kaa sambandh sangathit rajyon se sambandhit manushyon ke jivan se he
 Expressing the importance of the human element in the context of political science, in the Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Herman Heller even went on to say that "the all-round nature of political science is determined by its fundamental human beliefs
" ’’ vastutah iskaa arth yah he ki raajnneeti vigyaan ek aisa saamaajik vigyaan he jiske antargat is tathy kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he ki kisi sangathit raajnneetik samaaj main swayan manushya kii sthiti kya he
 Political science studies the policies of the government towards various communities and sections of the society along with the study of the rights and freedoms of the individual
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan kii paribhaasha ham aise shaastra ke rup main kar sakate he jiskaa sambandh uske rajya naamak sanghathan se hota he or jiske antargat swabhaavatah sarkaar kaa bhi vistrut adhyayan sammilit hota hai sankshep main raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat rajya, sarkaar tathaa anya sambandhit sanghathanon va sansthaaon kaa, maanav ke raajnneetik jivan ke sandarbh main adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Traditional definitions related to political science indicate the following trends: jis prakaar raajnneeti vigyaan kii paribhaasha vibhinn vichaarkon ne vibhinn prakaar se kii he, usee prakaar uske kshetra ko bhinn-bhinn lekhakon ne vibhinn shabdon main vyakt kiya he
 For example, according to the French thinker Blünschli, "political science deals with the bases of the state
 It studies its essential nature, its diverse forms, its expression and its development
" ’’ dow garnor ke anusaar ’’isaki moulik samasyaon main saadharantah pratham rajya kii utpatti or uski prakruti kaa anusandhan, dwitiya raajnneetik sansthaaon kii pragati, uske itihaas tathaa unke swaroopon kaa adhyayan, tathaa tritiy, jahaan tak sambhav ho, iske aadhaar par rajnatik or vikaas ke niyamon kaa nirdhaaran karnaa sammilit he
 Gatell has written a detailed description of the field of political science, that "historically, political science studies the origins of the state, the development of political institutions and the principles of the past
 


 vartmaan kaa adhyayan karne main yah vidyaman raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa vichaardhaaraon kaa varnan, unki tulana tathaa vargeekaran karne kaa praytn karata he
 For the purpose of making political institutions and activities more advanced on the basis of changing circumstances and moral norms, political science also looks forward to the future and also considers what the state should be like
 ’’ From the above definitions, in the field of political science, three ideologies emerge
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kshetra nirdhaaran karne hetu sanyukt raashtra sangh kii unesco dwaara sitambar 1948 main vishwa ke pramukh raajnneetishastriyon kaa sammelan ayojit kiya gaya jisamen paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke kshetra ke antargat nimnlikhit adhyayan vishay shaamil kiye jane kaa nirnay kiya gaya- Principles of Politics - Study of political theories and ideas of past and present
 raajnneetik sansthaayen - samvidhan, rashtriya sarkaar, pradeshik va sthaneey shashan kaa saral va tulanaatmak adhyayan
 Political Parties, Groups and Lokmat - a study of the political behavior of political parties and pressure groups, the process of participation of citizens in public opinion and governance
 anterrashtriya sambandh- anterrashtriya raajnneeti, anterrashtriya vidhi, anterrashtriya sanghathan tathaa anterrashtriya prashasan kaa adhyayan
 Traditional political science is based on philosophy and imagination
 paramparawaadi vichaarak adhikanshtah darshan se prabhavit rahe hai
 These thinkers have paid attention to the values of human life
 inke chintan kii pranali nigamanaatmak he
 Plato has a special significance in traditional political science
 plato ke atirikt roman vichaarak siciro or madhyayug main sant augustin ke chintan main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kii spasht jhalak milti hai
 There are a large number of strong supporters of traditional political science in the modern era
 ruso, kant, hegal, green, bosanke, laski, okshot evam leyostros kii rachanaaon main plato ke vichaaron kii spasht jhalak dikhaai detii he
 In the modern period, there has been severe criticism of traditional political science study material and state related beliefs
 aalochakon ke anusaar rajya va raajnneetik sansthaaon kii paridhi se pare bhi kuch prakriyaayein evam ek parivesh dekhne ko miltaa he jiske adhyayan kii upeksha raajnneeti vigyaan kii garima va upyogita ke liye anarthakaari he
 Defenders of this view believe that human behavior is the source of inspiration and study of all social sciences and political science is generally the study of the political aspect of human behavior
 dwitiya mahayuddh se purv katipay raajnneetik vichaarak raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main manushya kii raajnneetik prakriyaaon evam gatividhiyon ko pramukh sthaan diye jane ke prati aagrahashil rahe
 Balter Wagehot, Woodrow Wilson, Lord Bryce, etc
 emphasized realistic studies of politics
 graham vaalas, arthur bentle, ketalin or lasvail ne maanav evam uske vyavhaar ke adhyayan par bal diya
 Charles Marriam emphasized the development and use of scientific techniques and methods for the study of political science at the 1925 Conference of the American Political Science Association
 1930 main lasvail ne apni pustak ‘psico-pathology and politics’ main raajnneetik ghatnaon evam kriyaaon kii vyakhya ke liye frid ke manovigyaan ko aadhaar banaaya
 Before the Second World War, the University of Chicago in the United States had become the domain of behavioral political science
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan se aadhunik raajnneeti vigyaan tak kii vikaas prakriya main dwitiya mahayuddh kii ghatana kaa vishesh mahatv he jiske baad kii duniya purv kii duniya se raajnneetik sanrachana, audyogic vikaas, vaigyanik va takneekee uplabdhiyon tathaa sainya kshamta kii drushti se atyadhik bhinn thi
 This serious change took place globally, replacing the traditional concepts of human society and culture, giving rise to new concepts
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat is vaataavaran main charles marium ke apni rachana ’new aspect of politics’main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan hetu naveen evam vaigyanik takneekon ke prayog kaa purna samarthan kiya
 In the above background, in the 1960s, political scientists at the University of Chicago in the United States tried to free political science from the philosophical system and make its study more scientific
 raajnneeti vigyaan ko saamaajik vigyaan maanate huye iske adhyayan ko purna banane hetu samajashaastra, manovigyaan, arthshaastra, maanavshaastra jaise samaaj vigyaanon kii vaigyanik paddatiyon ko apnaanaa uchit samajha
 Among these scientists, David Easton, Caitlin, Lasvale, etc
 are prominent
 raajnneeti vigyaan kii aadhunik avadharanaon kii drushti se george ketalin, david easton, hairald lasvail va kaplan vishesh ullekhneey he
 These scholars have emphasized the real and practical contexts of politics in their political science statements, considering it to be a study of power, influence, political justification and power
 aadhunik drushtikon ke samarthak raajnneeti shastriyon dwaara raajnneeti vigyaan ke bare main jo vichaar prastut kiye hai unako nimnlikhit binduon ke antargat spasht kiya ja saktaa he- Political science is the study of human actions - According to the modern approach of political science, political science studies the political behavior and actions of human beings
 maanav vyavhaar ko gaiyr raajnneetik-kaarak bhi prabhavit karte he
 All these factors are studied in political science
 e
 hard evam es
 hantigton kaa kathan he ’’raajnneetik vyavahaarwad shashan ko maanav or uske samudaayon ke kaaryon kii ek prakriya ke rup main sweekaarta he
 Hasjar and Stevenson hold the view that "political science in its field of study is primarily concerned with the mutual and collective interaction of individuals and the power relations between states and states
" raajnneeti vigyaan shakti kaa adhyayan he- ketalin va lasvail is vichaar ke samarthak he
 The mainstay of both is psychology
 ketalin ne 1927-28 main rajya ke sthaan par manushya ke raajnneetik kriya kalap ke adhyayan par bal dete huye raajnneeti ko prabhutv evam niyantran ke liye kiye jane vaala sangharsh bataaya he
 According to him, the main source of conflict has been the desire of human beings that other people believe in its existence
 1962 main apnipustak systematic politics main ketalin ne likhaa he- niyantran bhaavana ke kaaran jo kaary kiye jate he tathaa niyantran kii bhaavana par aadhaarit sambandhon kii ichchhaaon ke kaaran jis dhaanche va ichchhaaon kaa nirmaan hota he, raajnneeti shaastra kaa sambandh un sabase he
 Another powerful thinker Laswell believes that every person tries to make an impact for the attainment of certain values and valuable persons in the society, and the spirit of power lies in the influence
 atah lasvail ke anusaar 'raajnneeti shaastra kaa abhisht vah raajnneeti he jo batalaaye ki koun, kya, kab or kaise praapt karata he
 According to him, political activity starts from the situation in which the doer tries to achieve different values and power is the necessary condition
 raajnneeti vigyaan raaj-vyavasthaaon kaa adhyayan he- is drushtikon ke samarthak david easton, amand, aar
 kegan aadi he
 This approach defines political science as a sociological approach
 inaki manyata he ki sampoorn samaaj swayan main ek vyavastha he or raaj vyavastha is sampoorn samaaj vyavastha kii ek upvyavastha he tathaa vah uske ek abhinn bhaag ke rup main hoti he
 There are many functional structures in the state system such as constitution, organs of government, political parties, pressure groups, public opinion and election and human behavior is an integral part of this system
 sankshep main in vidwaanon kii manyata he ki raajnneeti vigyaan sampoorn samaaj vyavastha ke ang ke rup main raaj-vyavastha kii in sanrachanaon kii parsparik kriyaaon evam sambandhon tathaa maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Political science places more emphasis on the following facts under the study of polity - the study of the political process as part of the overall social order, the structure of the system and the inter-relationship of groups
 raajnneeti vigyaan nirnay prakriya kaa adhyayan he- is drushtikon ke samarthak raajnneetishastri yah maanate he ki raajnneeti vigyaan sarkaar kaa adhyayan karte huye samaaj yaa rajya main vidyaman paristhitiyon ke sandarbh main sarkaar yaa shaastra ke niti sambandhi nirnay lene kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 For this reason, political science is a science that studies the policy process and policy making of a government, especially in the context of the factors affecting both of them, this view holds that in the context of human nature, policy making by the government -the process must be studied
 vaastavik raajnneetik jivan main shashan ke naam par nirnay lene kaa kaary swayan vyakti karte hai or isaliye nirnay nirmaan prakriya par nirnayakartaaon ke vyaktitv, abhiruchi samskruti, dharm, raajnneetik vichaardhaara, maansik str nirnay lene kii shakti aadi tatwon kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Hence it can be said that according to the modern view, political science studies the social political life of man
 iske antargat raajnneetik prakriyaaon ke saath saath raajnneetik sanghathanon kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 According to Pinock and Smith what is and should be and how to get as much coordination between these two as possible, we call the systematic study of government and political process political science
 aadhunik yug main raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kshetra atyadhik viksit he
 The ubiquity of politics in terms of power and influence has brought it everywhere and not only socially but also almost all aspects of personal life are under the political system
 raajnneeti kii sarvavyaapaktaa ne jahaan ek taraf raajnneetik vyakhyaaon kii lokdharmita siddh kii he vahiin usne raajnneetik kya he, is sambandh main aspashtataa va bhram bhi paidaa kiya hai
 Despite this, the field of political science can be understood well in state and non-state contexts
 rajyapradhan sandarbh main rajya kii avadharanaon- samaajwaad, loktantr ityadi, sarkaar yaa sanghathan samvidhan varnitav vaastavik vyavhaar sambandhi, sarkari pad va sansthaaon ke parsparik sambandh, nirvachan, vyavasthapika va nyaaypalika ke sanghathanaatmak va prayogtmak paksh tathaa rajya kii vyakhya se sambandhit raajnneetik vichaardhaara va avadharanae, utpatti ke, rajya kriyasheeltaa ke siddhanth, rajya-parak vichaardhaaraen swatantraaa, samanta, adhikaar ityadi
 In the non-state context, the procedural reality of politics, different approaches to the political system, non-state organizations such as political parties, pressures and interest groups, non-state processes and their expansion, international political realities and complexities are covered
 pratinidhitiv ke sidwanton va vidhiyon ko bhi isi sandarbh main samajha ja saktaa he
 There are some basic assumptions of the modern approach to the field of political science, such as the adoption of a realistic approach in determining the field of study, the subject matter of political science should be understood under an inter-disciplinary approach, the scientific method and approaches in the study of political science Be used
 aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan ke kshentra ko nimna binduon ke antargat spasht kiya ja saktaa he- Study of political behavior of human- Modern approach emphasizes the study of political behavior of human
 yadhyapi par maanav vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne balki gaiyr-raajnneetik tatwon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he uski manyata he ki maanav vyavhaar ko yatharth rup main samajhane ke liye un sabhi gaiyr raajnneetik bhaawanaaon, manyataon evam shaktiyon ke adhyayan ko sammilit kiya jaye jo maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar ko prabhavit karte he
 Study of various concepts - Modern political science mainly studies power, influence, power, control, decision process etc
 is drushtikon ke anusaar ye aisi avadharanaai he jinaki prishthbhumi main hi raajnneetik sansthaae kaary karti he
 Political scientists study political institutions in the context of these concepts
 isi kaaran is prakaar ke adhyayan ko sattaaon kaa anaupchaarik adhyayan kaha gaya he
 Study of Political Science Problems and Conflicts - Modern political scientists such as Professors Dyck and Peter Odgaard cover political science in the field of study of public problems and conflicts
 unke mat main mulyon evam sadhano kii simitta ke kaaran unke vitaran kii samasya paidaa hone se tanaav va raajnneeti kaa prarambh ho jaataa he
 Apart from political parties, it spreads to various individuals and groups
 professor daayak ne raajnneeti ko saarvajanik samasyaon par paraspar virdohi ichchhaaon vaale paatro ke sangharsh kii raajnneeti kaha he
 Peter Odiegard believes that there should be no control of externalities other than politics in this struggle
 saarvajanik sahmati va saamaanya abhimath kaa adhyayan - kuch vidwaanon ke mat main raajnneeti vigyaan saarvajanik samasyaon par sahmati va saamaanya abhimath kaa adhyayan he
 In his view, the struggle is not only for the struggle but to influence the general consensus and general opinion
 isiliye edward weinfield ne kaha he ki ‘kisi masale ko sanghariumay banane athwa sulajhane vaali gatividhiyon sabhi raajnneeti kaa ang he
 '' uparokt vishleshan se spasht he ki aadhunik drushtikon ke viddhanon main raajnneeti vigyaan ke kshetra ke sambandh main kuch matbhed hone ke baavjood kuch aadharbhoot baton par sahmati he, jaise sabhi kii manyata he ki raajnneeti vigyaan kaa adhyayan kshetra yathartwaadee ho, iske adhyayan main antar-anushaasanamak drushtikon va vaigyanik paddati kaa prayog hona chahie
 However, it is true that the claim of scientific authenticity and certainty of modern political scientists in political science has not yet been fulfilled
 isi kaaran pinok evam smith ne aadhunik drushtikon main kuch sanshodhan ko sweekaar karte hue raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main vyaavhaarik raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke saath hi raajnneetik sansthaaon ke sanghathanaatmak evam moolyaatmak adhyayan ko uchit sthaan dene kii baat kahi he According to Aristotle, man is a social animal

 Due to the close proximity of political science and other social sciences, there has been a tradition of inter-disciplinary study in the study of political science since ancient times

 Today, the opening of new branches of political science, such as political economics, political ethics, political history, political sociology, political psychology, and political geography, is a symbol of the fact that political science cannot operate without establishing relations with other social sciences

 lorents ne apane siddhant dwaara yah dikhaaya ki prakaash kii varnakram rekha ko chumbakeey kshetra kii lambdisha main dekhne par teen ghatak rekhaayen drushtigochar honi chahie In the Zeman effect when only three component lines are seen at the above displacement, it is called Prakrit Zeman effect and the sample of those component lines is called Prakrit Trika or Lorents Trika
 parantu jab ek varnakram rekha kai adhik ghatak rekhaon main vibhajit ho jaati he, tab use aprakrut zemaan prabhaav kehete hai, kyonki uski vyakhya chir pratishthit siddhant ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati
 The Prakrit Zeman triad is special form and is represented by the spectral lines of the unit range, while the Lande coefficient of the initial and final energy state is equal to one
 saadhaaran lorents trik jasta or cadmium ke varnakramon main dekhe gaye tathaa unke aavritivisthaapan qdh or kt kii maap se e / m kaa pariman uparyukt sutara dwaara nikaala gaya, jo runagra kirnon dwaara nikaale hue e / m ke baraabar paaya gaya
 This result is the observed direction of rotation of circular polarity in unity and longitudinal view, evidence that radiation in the atomic spectrum emits by moving negative electric charge
 preston ne adhik vikshepan or vibhedan-kshamta vaale upkarnon ke prayog dwaara yah sthapit kiya ki usee varnakram rekhaon kii kisi vishisht shrenee kaa zemin-ghatak-rekhaon kaa namoona ek hi prakaar kaa hota he or us shrenee kaa lakshan hota he
 Thus the Zeman effect became the typical means of spectral analysis
 san 1907 main ruunge ne yah dikhaaya ki aprakrut zemaan namoonon kii ghatak rekhaon kaa visthaapan, prakrut trik rekhaon ke visthaapan gunanfal ke rup main prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the p and s components will have displacement and Lorent units
 ke liye yah visthaapan lorents ikaiyaan hoga
 The Zeeman effect is seen only when the external magnet field is weaker than the internal field generated by the electron's ground and orbit motions; But when the external field is stronger than these internal regions, then the Zeeman effect becomes the western-back effect
 yah prabhaav san 1912 main pashchan or back ne dekha or yah paaya ki bahut adhik teevr chumbak kshetra main prakrut zemaan ghatak namoona prakrut zemaan ghatak namoona prakrut zemaan trik main badal jaataa he
 That is why the zeman effect is the main tool for spectral analysis and to detect the electron formation of atoms and ions

 Salim Singh, who used to be a minister of Jaisalmer, used to behave quite vigorously in the village, due to which all the villagers got upset and left the village overnight and went away with curse and this is why it is also called cursed village

 Kuldhara village, 18 km away from the Jaisalmer city of Rajasthan, 500 years ago, 600 houses and 85 villages of Paliwal Brahmino's kingdom was a state that cannot be imagined, there is no water in the desert desert and Paliwal Brahmino
 He performed a miracle that was far beyond the human mind, he did not use the available water on the ground, nor did it store the rain water but the desert He discovered a particle of water in the soil and built his village above the surface of the gypsum, at that time he discovered the land of the gypsum so that the rain water does not soak the ground, and for the sound the village made such a sound that the enemy would come from far away
 She used to come inside the village 4 times before that

 But the Paliwal Brahmins cursed that this Kuldhara will always remain deserted, no one will be able to come again to this land, aaj bhi jaisalmer main jo taapmaana rahata he garmi ho yaa sardi,kuldhara gaav main aate hi taapmaana main 4 degree kii badhotaree ho jaati he

 kuch abhilekh in nivaasiyon ke jati or gotra kaa bhi ullekh karte hai
 Other castes mentioned in the inscription are - Harjal, Harjalu, Harjaluni, Mugdal, Jisutia, Loharthi, Lahthi, Lakhar, Saharan, Jag, Kalsar and Mahajalar

 Diwan was so mad after the girl that he wanted to find her in some way
 usne iske liye brahmanon par dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya
 The extent of this happened when the diwan, sent under the charge of power, sent a message to the girl's house that if she did not find the girl till the next Purnamasi, she would attack the village and pick up the girl
 gaanvvaalon ke liye yah mushkil kii ghadi thi
 They either had to save the village or their daughter
 is vishay par nirnay lene ke liye sabhi 84 gaanv vaale ek mandir par ikattha ho gaye or panchayaton ne faisla kiya ki kuch bhi ho jaae apni ladki us dewan ko nahin denge
 What was it then, the villagers decided to vacate the village and overnight, all 84 villages disappeared from their eyes
 jate-jate unhone shraap diya ki aaj ke baad in gharon main koi nahin bas paaegaa
 Even today the condition is the same as it was that night when people left it
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yahaan pani kii samasya ke kaaran log gaanv chhodkar nahin gaye balki jaisalmer rajya ke mantri saleem singh ke atyaachaar ke kaaran gaye the
 According to the legends, there used to be a large number of people, including a head, a beautiful daughter of the chief, who came out of Kuldhara village and reached the state of Jaisalmer
 jab iskaa pataa saleem singh ko chalaa to vah us sundar kanya par rup mohit ho gaya is kaaran usne gaanv waalon par dabaav banane laga
 Salim Singh wanted him to marry the daughter of the chief but the villagers did not want the name of the Brahmin society to be shortened
 is kaaran gaanv ke mukhiya ne ek raat sabha bulaai or sabhi ne faisla liya ki ham log raaton raat yah gaanv chhodkar chale jaaenge ,anyathaa yah gaanv kii kanya se shaadi kar degaa
 Then one night all the villagers left the whole village and went to another village
 logon kaa kahana he ki ye gaanv vaale jate -jate yah shraap bhi dekar gaye the ki yahan phir koi nahin bas paayegaa isliye vartmaan main yah rajasthan ke jaisalmer kaa gaanv ek shaapit gaanv kehalaata he
 Earlier, it was not allowed to visit this village, because this village is called Bhootiya Gaon, according to people, ghosts live here
 lekin abhi rajasthan sarkaar ne yah daawa kiya he ki yahan koi bhoot nahin rahete he isliye sabhi ke liye khol diya he or paryaton sthal kaa darja diya gaya he
 Because of this, thousands of people come to visit here
 yahan sthaneey log hi nahin apitu desh evam videsh se bhi aate he
