 albanian greece, dakshini italy ke purvi tat or sicily main bhi boli jaati he

 It is practiced as two dialects, Northern and Southern

 Very few words seem to have come from the ancient Greek language, but some words from medieval and modern Greek have wandered into this language
 jaise "lipset" shabd serbian bhashaa se albenian main aayaa, kintu usase pehle srbija ne ise greek se liya tha
 Many words are also derived from Slavic languages
 clasiki yug main pracheen greek kaa prabhaav albenia tak nahin pahunch paaya, jabaki laathini prabhaav bahut pehle se hi vahaan tak pahunch chukaa tha
 In Albanian Ankavali, the words "katre" for four and "quid" for cent are definitely Latin
 jabaki "pes" or dahet mul bhartiya-europea-parivaar ke hai
 Similarly the Latin "amicus" remains "meek" in Albanian
 shaktishaalee roman samrajya ke prabhutvkaal main albenian naagarik shabdaawalee par yathanusaar prabal laathini prabhaav bhi padaa, kintu gramin janata ne apni bhashaa ko aaj tak sarvada "shuddh" rakhaa he
 Its pronunciation and grammar are intact in their fundamental form even today
 yah bhashaa jis parvatiy pradesh main boli jaati he, vah apiras ke uttar main, mantinigro ke dakshin main or adriatik sagar ke purvasth he
 When and how it came into the region is still uncertain
 is bhashaa ke 15veen shatabdi ke hi uplabdh sahitya ko sabase pracheen kaha jaataa he, kintu anya adhikansh pracheen sahitya 16veen or 17veen shatabdi kaa hi miltaa he
 The language in which modern Albanian literature is written is not much different from the present language and the present language is often the unchanged form of the ancient dialects

 After Pakistan's independence, it was important in the responsibilities of Pakistan's first Constituent Assembly which was elected in December 1945 that the constitution of the newly independent state of Pakistan be made
 vidhansabha ne sarvasammati se 12 march san 1949 ko uddeshy sankalp paarit kiya, jiske aadarshon par nae samvidhan kii sthapana kii jaani thi
 The House was dissolved in October 1954, before the Assembly could make a new constitution according to the resolution

 According to this constitution, a parliamentary system was established in the country and two houses of Shura were also constituted
 1973 tak pakistan kii sansad ek sadaneey thi
 When Pakistan broke up after the Bangladesh independence war in 1971, one of the reasons for its breakdown in the Pakistani political community was that it was understood that governments did not pay heed to small states
 atah 1970 kii antarim vidhanmandal ne 1973 kaa samvidhan gathan kiya jise 12 april 1973 ko paarit kiya gaya or 14 agast 1973 ko islamic ganraajya pakistan main puri tarah se lagu kar diya gaya jiske anusaar pakistan main dwisadaneey sansadeey pranali sthapit kii gai
 And, for the first time, the Constitution of 1973 established a High Court, that is, the Senate so that all small states get representation like big states

 sampadan karen Shri Namdev ji is a famous saint of India
 vishwa bhar main unki pahchaan "sant shiromani" ke rup main jaani jaati he
 During his time, the Nath and Mahanubhav sects were promoted in Maharashtra
 r Saint Shiromani Sri Namdevji was born at sunrise on "kartik Shukla Ekadashi Samvat 1327, Sunday" on October 26, 1270, in "pandharpur", Marathwada, Maharashtra
 maharashtra ke satara jile main krishna nadi ke kinare basaa "narsi bamani gaanv, jila parabhani unka paitruk gaanv he
" sant shiromani shri namdev ji kaa janm "shimpi", jise rajasthan main "chhipa" bhi kehete he, parivaar main hua tha
 His father's name was Damasheth and mother's name was Gonai
 inkaa parivaar bhagwaan vitthal kaa param bhakt tha
 Namdevji was married to Kalyan resident Rajai and had four sons and daughters-in-law namely "narayana - Ladabai", "vitthal - Godabai", "mahadev - Yesabai", and "govind - Sakrabai" and a daughter named Limbabai
 shri namdev ji kii badi bahan kaa naam aaubai tha
 One of his grandchildren was named Mukund and his maid was "sant Janabai", who lived at the house of Damasheth even before the birth of Sant Namdevji
 sant shiromani shri namdevji ke nanaaji kaa naam gomaji or naniji kaa naam umabai tha
 Saint Namdevji accepted Visoba Khecher as Guru
 visoba khechar kaa janm sthaan paithan tha, jo pangarpur se pachaas kos dur "ondhya nagnath" naamak pracheen shiv kshetra main hai
 In this temple, he taught Saint Shiromani Shri Namdevji and made him his disciple
 sant namdev, sant gyaneshwar ke samakaleen the or umr main unase 5 saal bade the
 Sant Namdev, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Nivrithinath, Sant Sopanadev along with his sister Bahub Muktabai and other contemporary saints traveled all over Maharashtra with North India and composed "abhang" and taught Janata Janardhana the lesson of Samata and Prabhu-bhakti
 sant gyaneshwar ke paralokagaman ke baad duusare saathi santon ke saath inhone puure bharat kaa bhraman kiya
 He wrote compositions in Marathi as well as Hindi
 inhone atharah varsho tak punjab main bhagavannam kaa prachaar kiya
 Some of his compositions are still found in the Sikh religious book "guru Granth Sahib"
 isamen sant namdevji ke 61pad sangrahit hai
 Even today his composed abhangas are sung with devotion and love all over Maharashtra
 ye samvath 1407 main samadhi main leen ho gaye
 During the time of Sant Namdevji, Nath and Mahanubhav sects were promoted in Maharashtra

 Apart from these, the worship of "vithoba" of Pandharpur was also prevalent in Maharashtra
 sant namdevji pangarpur main vaari pratha shuru karwaane ke janak hai
 Under this practice, even today, the general public used to do Ashari and Kartiki Ekadashi every year as "vari" of Pandharpur for their darshans, such wari is called "varkari"
 vitalopasna kaa yah "panth" "warkari" sampradaay kehalaata he
 Shri Namdev is considered the chief saint of this sect
 warkari sant namdev ke samay ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 The reason for the differences is that there have been five saints named Namdev in Maharashtra and they all have done a little "abhang" and composition
 aavate kii "sakal santagatha" main namdev ke naam par 2500 abhang milte hai
 Of the nearly 600 abhangas, there is only the imprint of Namdev or "nama" and in the remaining "vishnudasanama"
 namdev ji kaa janm 26 oktober 1270, ravivaar main pratham sanvatsar, samvath 1327, karthik shukla ekadshi ko pangarpur main hua tha
 Namdevji was born in Pandharpur near Dama Sheth "shimpi", a native of a village called Narsi Brahmani, also known as "chhipa" in Rajasthan

 Those who saw God in the idol of Namdev Pandharpur's "vitthal" started to experience Khecher everywhere after coming in contact with him
 unako premabhakti main gyaan kaa samavesh ho gaya
 Dr
 Mohan Singh calls "namdev" a disciple of Ramanand
 parantu maharashtra main inaki bahumanya guru parampara is prakaar he -gyaneshwar ji or namdev ji ne uttar bharat kii saath-saath yatra kii thi

 Like GRP, it is a specific medium to reach a target audience, measured by advertising as the sum of ratings

 If a TV ad airs 5 times it reaches 50% of the total audience and only 60% of the targeted viewers, it will have 250 grps - ie GRP = frequency x reach - in this case TRP 60% of 250 grps
 Will = 150 TRP - This is the target rating point, which is 60% of the total rating
 ye do metrics mahatvapurn ghatak hai jo ek vishesh vigyaapan kaa vipanan prabhaavashiltaa ko nirdhaarit karte hai

 yah channel kii aavritiyon ko padhata he, jo baad main, channel ke naamon main dicode kiya jaataa he or yah agency rashtriya data taiyaar karata he jo in namoonay gharon ke reeding par aadhaarit he
 But there is a flaw in this technique, as cable operators often change the frequencies of different channels before sending signals to homes
 ek channel ko agar ek nishchit aavruti ke anusaar padhaa gaya to yah gumraah kar sakati he yadi puri bharat main ek hi down linking aavruti kyon na ho
 The second technology is more reliable and relatively new in India

 Where appropriate type of water is available in the required quantity, the water required by machines is easily supplied
 taaja jal nagarpalikaon ke jalaashyon se mil jaataa he, kintu is jal ke jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye prayukt chlorin gas ke avshesh ko pehle alag kar liya jaataa he, kyonki yah gas jalashay ke jeevon ko haani pahunchaati he
 If sea water is necessary for the reservoir, then take water from a place in the sea where there is no dirt coming from the rivers, or falling otherwise
 aise sthanon par bhi tufaanon ke kaaran jal upyog ke ayogy thahar saktaa he, isaliye anek jagahon par aisa prabandh rahata he ki hauj main ek baar bharaa hua jal pun: sanchaarit hota rahata he or maarg main uske chaanane or upyukt banane kii kriyaayein sampann ho jaati hai
 For this purpose, water from the livestock goes through a filter and enters a tank at the bottom
