 The movement for the creation of the Jan Lokpal Bill began in its all-india form on 5 April 2011 with a hunger strike by social activist Anna Hazare and his comrades at Jantar Mantar, including Magsaysay Award winner Arvind Kejriwal, India's first woman Administrative officer Kiran Bedi, famous folkloric lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev, founder of Patanjali Yogpeeth were included
 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of the Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand
 kintu manmohan singh ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen sarkaar ne iske prati nakaaratmak ravaiya dikhaaya or isaki upeksha kii
 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected
 kintu is anshan ke andolan kaa rup lene par bharat sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main ek samiti banaakar sambhavit khatre ko taala or 16 agast tak sansad main lokapal vidheyak paas karaane kii baat sweekaar kar lee
 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 The government stuck many obstacles in its path and arrested Anna Hazare and his associates on 16 August
 kintu isse andolan pure desh main bhadak uthaa
 a large number of dharnas, demonstrations and fasts were organized continuously for the next 12 hearts across the country
 antat sansad dwaara anna kii teen sharton par sahamati kaa prastaav paas karne ke baad 28 agast ko anna ne apana anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna Hazare started a fast unto death on 5 April 2011 in protest against government inaction demanding the creation of a strong Lokpal Bill
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unki is muhim main arvind kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, baba ramdev evam anya anek prasiddh samajasevi shaamil the
 The government continued to neglect it
 is anshan ko bharat evam sheeghra hi vishwa ke sanchaar madhyamon main vistrut rup se prakashit or prasaarit kiya jane laga
 This ongoing effort against corruption soon got widespread public support
 bharat ke praayah sabhi shaharon main yuva sadakon par utar aae evam iske samarthan main pradarshan kiya tathaa parche baante
 Concerned over the spread of Anna Hazare's fast as a nationwide mass movement, the government immediately announced a committee to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill
 usne 16 agast se pehle sansad main ek majboot lokapal vidheyak paas karaane par bhi sahmati prakat kar di
 In this way, this fast came to an end and the mass movement that flourished against corruption ended with the hope of building a strong Lokpal
 kintu sarkari manshaa sandigdh thi isliye anna hajaare ne saath hi ghoshnaa kii ki yadi aagaamee 15 agast tak apekshit lokapal vidheyak nirmit nahin hua to ve 16 agast se punah anshan par jaayenge
 The government announced the creation of a 10-member Lokpal draft construction committee, in accordance with the terms of the cessation of Anna Hazare's fast in April
 isamen sarkaar ke 5 evam naagarik samaaj ke 5 pratinidhi rakhe gaye
 Anna Hazare accepted a minister to be the chairman of the committee, not opposing the logic of compulsion of the constitutional provisions of the government
 kintu kapil sibbal ke netritv vaali is samiti ke mantriyon ne apni manamaani kii
 There was opposition between the civil society representatives and the government over the issue of bringing the Prime Minister and judges under the Lokpal
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bhavishya main kaanoon banane ke liye naagarik samaaj kii raay nahin lee jaaegi
 Finally, the ministers refused to accept all the important suggestions of the Jan Lokpal presented by Anna Hazare
 dikhaave ke liye jan lokapal ke ve sabhi bindu maan liye gaye jo sarkari mantriyon or saansadon, evam nyayadhishon ko lokapal kii pahunch se baahar rakhte the
 Finally disappointed with the attitude of government ministers, Anna Hazare's colleagues drafted the Jan Lokpal draft separately
 or is tarah samiti ne do masaude kaa nirmaan kiya jise kendriya mantrimandal ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 There too, the draft of the ministers was fully presented but the summary of the Jan Lokpal was kept
 or apeksha ke anuroop mantrimandal ne mantriyon ke masaude ko apanaakar sansad main pesh karne ke liye sahmati de di
 On 4 August 2011, the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament
 sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 But all former Prime Ministers were placed under its purview
 iske anusaar lokapal ek samiti hogi jiske adhyaksh vartmaan yaa sevanivrutt nyaayadhish honge
 It will have eight members, of which four will be law-abiding and experienced people
 isamen jaanch kii samay seemaa saat saal rakhi gai thi
 India's 65th Independence Day celebrations were held in the shadow of Anna Hazare's announcement of the end of the April fast that if the government did not pass the Lokpal Bill by August 15, they would go on a fast
 15 agast se kai din purv hi yah spasht ho chukaa tha ki 16 agast se ghoshit anshan jarur hoga
 The government started every effort to stop it
 dilli police ne 1 agast tak jantar mantar par anshan kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare suggested four other places and asked for permission to fast there, but that too was not given
 antat 13 agast ko anna hajaare ne ghoshnaa kii ki yadi unhen anshan kii ijaajat nahin di gai to ve jail baro andolan shuru karenge
 He also announced to abandon water
 dilli police ne jepi park main anshan karne kii anumati 22 pratibandhon ke saath di

 inamen pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya 5000 tak simit rakhane, anshan 3 din tak hi karne, anshan sthal par laudspikar kaa prayog na karne, tent na lagane aadi kii sharten shaamil thim
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of the 65th Independence Day celebrations of India, expressed his desire to end corruption on the one hand, but at the same time termed any demonstration for him as unconstitutional
 anna hajaare sara din rajghat par chintan karte rahe or shaam ko anshan ke jari rakhane kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said, "we will go to JP Park for a fast in the morning
 We have come to know that there is Section 144 there but if we refuse to go there, then we will sit in the same place where we have to go
 prashasan unhen jahaan bhi le jaae unka anshan vahiin hoga, "ham jail main anshan par baithenge, vahaan le gaye or agar phir chhod diya to waapas jepi park par aakar baith jaayenge

 The police told the people present there that they were taking Anna to the fast
 unhone jivan anmol aspataal ke paas media or anna samarthakon ko aage badhane se roak diya
 Shortly after being arrested and taken to the Civil Lines Police Mess in Delhi, he started his fast there and refused to take water
 dilli kii ek vishesh adaalat main aage andolan na karne or apane samarthakon ko andolan karne ke liye na kehane jaisi sharton vaale nijee muchalaka na dene ke baad adaalat ne anna hazareor unke sahyogiyon ko saat dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya

 The issue of corruption was discussed in the Lok Sabha

 But we have three main demands

 All three are for the poor
 in muddon par satta paksh or vipaksh main jab tak sahmati nahin banati he tab tak unka anshan jari rahegaa
 Responding to the Prime Minister and the entire Parliament expressing concern over his health, Anna Hazare said that "we thank him for this
" lekin mere swasthya kii chintaa aaj unhen hui
 He is worried about Anna's health, where was he for 10 days
 darasal, chintaa un logon ko he jo yahaan aae hue hai
 Those in air condition are not worried about Anna's health
 "anna ne vilasarav ko die gaye patr main pradhanmantri ko likhaa ki- "hamaare man main hamaari sansad ke prati apaar sammaan he, hamaari sansad hamaare janatantr kaa pavitra mandir he
 i am not sitting on hunger for any of my selfishness, just as you are working for the good of the country, in the same way, i also keep thinking about the people of the country
 mere paas kisi prakaar kii koi satta nahin he
 i am a very normal person and have a feeling of doing something for the society and the poor people

 We are against corruption

 If during my movement some words have been uttered by me or any of my companions that have hurt you or any other person, i express my heartfelt gratitude to all of us
 kisi ko aahat karnaa hamaara maqasad nahin he
 Lokayuktas should also be created through this law in every state, Citizens Charter should be made for public problems in every department, which should be acted upon by the concerned officer if they do not agree, and thirdly, all employees from the top to the bottom of the central government and all the employees of the state Be brought under its purview
 kya in teen baton par sansad main prastaav laayaa ja saktaa he? mujhe ummid hi nahin yaqiin he ki hamaare sabhi saansad desh kii janata ko bhrashtachar ke rose-rose ke zillat se nijaat dilaane ke liye shuru main raji ho jaaenge
 meri antaratma kahati he ki in baton par agar sansad main sahmati hoti he to main apana anshan tod don
 " janalokapal bill kii baaqi baaten, jaise chayan prakriya aadi bhi bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye atyant mahatvapurn hai
 i will be sitting in Ramlila Maidan with my people till all the other issues are decided in Parliament because this is the voice of the people
 mere saath desh bhar main itane log is ummid se jude hai ki unhen bhrashtachar se nijaat milegi
 For this, it is necessary that the law should be passed for the formation of Lokayukta in the states as well

 Irony, inequality, violence, murder, exploitation, greed, lust, jealousy, capitalism, genocide, war were not just words for him - all of them theatrical symbol Usman composed so differently in his plays that he was surprised to see it happens

After so many years of Bharata Muni's 'natyashastra', can violence also be an untouchable reference in the new theater to express the reality of modern life? Is our cinema completely free from scenes of violence? Do we not see many explicit and hidden forms of violence in real life orgy on the stage of today's society? Are we not able to see the selfishness of the contemporary lifestyle, obstructionist, cut-throat competition, leg-slapping, petty competition, etc

 yah udhaaharan ek paddati par chalata he: koi ek chiz kii ichha rakhata he, use aprapya paata he or apane asangati ko us vastu kii aalochana kar ke kam karata he
 John Alster named this pattern "optimizer preferential construction"
 asangati kaa ek mahatvapurn kaaran he ek vichaar jo swa-avadharana ke moulik tatwon ke saath sangharsh karata he, jaise "main ek acha vyakti hum" yaa "maine sahi nirnay liya
 "an anxiety that arises from the possibility of a bad decision being taken may result in rationalization, the tendency to make additional reasons or to justify the support of one's choice
" ek vyakti jisane abhi-abhi ek nai car par bahut sara paisa kharch kiya he use aisa lagata he ki kisi anya kii puraani car ke mukaable uski nai car ke kharaab ho jane kii kaaphi kam sambhaavna he
 This belief may or may not be true, but it will reduce the inconsistency and make the person feel good
 Inconsistency leads to confirmation bias, refusal of evidence to be proved and other important defense systems

 With no way of reaching them, she speculates that the grapes may not be edible
 The incompatibility of wanting something unattainable vs
 not getting it can be reduced by judiciously deciding that grapes are flawed
 sangyanatmak asangati ke purv adhyayan main sarvaadhik prasiddh maamle ko lion fasetinjar or wain profesi fells naamak pustak ke anya logon dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya
 These writers infiltrated a group hoping that the destruction of this earth was imminent at a certain date
 jab vah bhavishyavaanee vifal ho gai, to yah aandolan bikharane ke bajaae or viksit hua, jab sadasyon main apni kattarvadita ko sabit karne kii hode lag gai jiske liye unhone dharmantariton ko kaam par lagaaya 
 Another example of cognitive dissonance is the Ben Franklin effect
 Franklin won a political opponent by demanding a favor, and he describes it as: meraa laksh uski chatukaarita purna sammaan karke uski krupa paanaa nahin hai, lekin kuch samay baad, maine yah doosraa tarika apanaaya
 yah sunakar ki unke pustkaalay main kuch bahut hi durlabh or vilakshan pustak thi, maine usko ek note likhaa, jisamen maine us pustak ko praapt karne kii ichha zaahir kii or yah aagrah kiya ki ve is pustak ko kuch dinon ke liye mujhe de kar mujhapar yah upkaar karen
 unhone us pustak ko turant bheja or maine ek saptaah main ek or note ke saath use waapas kar diya, jisamen maine unke dwaara kiye gaye upkaar ke prati apni bhaavana ko prakat kiya
 The next time we met in the house, he spoke to me and that too with much civility; And even then, he showed readiness to assist me on all occasions and our friendship continued till his death
 This is another example of the truth of an old adage that i read, which goes like this, "the person who did you good once would be ready to do it the second time, rather than the one you adored yourself
" Ho 
" franklin kii dharna aage chal kar ben franklin prabhaav ke rup main jaani jaati he
 After lending the book to Franklin, his rival had to sort out the inconsistency of his attitude towards Franklin, to which he had just done a favor
 unhone apane is upkaar ko swayan se yah kah kar uchit tehraaya ki vah vastav main franklin ko pasand karte hai or parinamswaroop tab se unase ruukhepan se pesh aane ke bajaay izzat se vyavhaar karte hai
 Smoking is often regarded as an example of cognitive dissonance because it is widely accepted that cigarettes can cause lung cancer, yet almost everyone wishes to live a longer and healthier life
 siddhant ke sandarbh main, ek lanbaa jivan jeene kii ichha aisi kisi gatividhi ke saath asangat he jiske dwaara jivan ke chote hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna hoti he
 The stress generated by these conflicting views can be reduced by quitting smoking, denying evidence of lung cancer, or justifying your smoking habit
 udhaaharan ke liye, dhumrapaan karne vaale apane vyavhaar ko yah kah kar yuktisangat tehra sakate hai ki dhumrapaan karne vaale keval chand log hi biimaar hote hai, yaa ki yah atyadhik dhumrapaan karne waalon ko hi hota he yaa yadi unki mrityu dhumrapan se nahin hoti to kisi chiz se hogi
 jabaki rasinic lat, maujuuda dhumrapaan karne waalon ke liye sangyanatmak asangati ke alaava kaam kar sakati he, dhumrapaan karne vaale nae vyakti sangyanatmak asangati saral lakshanon ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 This case of cognitive dissonance can be interpreted in terms of a threat to co-concept
 yah soch ki "main apane fefdon ke cancer ke jokhim main vruddhi kar rahaa hum", is "aatm-sambandhi vishwaas ke saath asangat he ki "main ek smart, yuktiyukt vyakti hum jo hameshaa sahi nirnay karata he
 "because often making excuses is easier than changing behavior, theories of dissonance lead to the conclusion that humans are rational but not always rational beings
 sangyanatmak asangati par kiye gaye adhikansh anusandhan chaar pramukh mandandon kaa rup le lete hai
 The important research generated by the theory is concerned with the consequences of openness of information, which are inconsistent with prior beliefs, what happens when the person begins to act in ways that are inconsistent with the prior view, what happens when the person makes the decision and With the effect of expending efforts
 asangati us samay utpann hoti he jab logon kaa saamana aisi jaankareeyon ke saath hota he jo unke vishwaas ke saath paraspar-virdohi hote hai
 If changing your perception does not reduce dissonance, then this inconsistency results in a rejection or neutralization of a misconception or information, taking support from people who share that belief and persuading others to reconcile Let's try
 sangyanatmak asangati ke siddhant kaa ek praarambhik sanskaran leone fasetinjar ke 1956 kii kitaab wain profesi fells main prakashit kiya gaya
 The book details the growing faith inside that sometimes simulates the prophetic failure of a cult
 sabhi vishwaas karne vaale ek purv-nirdhaarit sthaan or samay par mili, yah maanate hue ki keval akele ve hi prithvi ke vinaash se batch jayega
 nirdhaarit samay aayaa or bina kisi ghatana ke ghatit hue guzar gaya
 They faced an acute cognitive dissonance: have they suffered any deception? Did they donate their worldly possessions in vain? Most members chose to believe in some lesser anomaly: the aliens had given Earth a second chance, and this group was now empowered to spread the message: Earth-corruption would have to be stopped
 This group dramatically increased conversions despite the failure of the prophecy
 fasetinjar or carlsmith ke clasik 1959 ke prayog main, chaatro ko ek ghante kaa samay kathin or ubaau kaary karke bitaane ke liye kaha gaya 
 yah kaary ek majboot, nakaaratmak ravaiya utpann karne ke uddeshy se dizin kiya gaya tha
 Once those children completed this task, the experimenters urged some of them to do a simple task
 unhen duusare subject se baat karne ko kaha gaya or unhen yah vishvas dilaane ko kaha gaya ki unke dwaara kiye gaye kaary dilachasp or manohak the
 Some participants were paid $ 20 for this grace, another group was asked $ 1, and a control group was asked not to accept the grace
 adhyayan ke ant main jab unase ubaau kaary kaa dar-nirdhaaran karne ko kaha gaya, 20 dollar samooh or niyantran samoohon ke mukaable 1 dollar samooh ne uskaa adhik sakaaratmak rup se dar-nirdhaaran kiya
 This was explained by Festinger and Karlsmith as evidence for cognitive dissonance
 shodhakartaaon ne yah siddhant diya ki log paraspar virdohi anubhuti ke bich asangati anubhav karte he, "maine kisi se kaha ki kaary rochak tha" or "maine vastav main use ubaau paaya
 "upon being paid only $ 1, the student held their stance which they were forced to express, as they had no other justification
 haalanki, 20 dollar vaale samooh ke paas ek unke vyavhaar ke liye ek spasht bahya auchity tha or is prakaar unhen kam asangati kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In later experiments, an alternative method of incompatibility inducing became common
 is shodh main, shodhakartaaon ne vipareet-vyavhaar niabandh-lekhan kaa prayog kiya, jisamen logon ko alag-alag raashi kaa bhugtan kiya gaya aise niabandh likhane ke liye jinamein unhen unke swayan ke vichaaron ke vipareet raay vyakt karnaa tha
 People who have been paid only a small amount have less justification for their incompatibility and experience more dissonance
 prerit-anupaalan pratimaan kaa ek prakaar nishiddh khilonaa pratimaan he
 An experiment by Karlsmith and Aronson in 1963 tested self-justification in children
 is prayog main, bacchon ko ek kamare main kai kism ke khilaunon ke saath chhod diya gaya, jisamen ek bahut hi vaanchhneeya khilonaa shaamil the
 Upon leaving the room, the experimenters told half the children that a severe punishment would be inflicted on playing with a particular toy and the other half told that a minor punishment would be given
 All children in the study avoided playing with that toy
 baad main, jab bacchon ko kaha gaya ki ve azaadi ke saath apni pasand kii sabhi khilaunon ke saath khel sakate hai, maamuli sajaa vaale samooh ke bacchon kii, sazaa hataa liye jane par bhi, us khilone se kam khilne kii sambhaavna thi
 Children who were threatened with minor punishment had to explain themselves why they did not play with toys
 sazaa kaa str apane aap main itnaa adhik nahin tha, isliye apane asangati ko kam karne ke liye, un bacchon ko khud ko yah samajhaana padaa ki vah khilonaa khele jane laayak nahin tha
 In another type of experiment conducted by Jack Brehm, 225 female students determined the rate of a series of common instruments and were then allowed to choose one of two devices that they would use as a gift
 Could take it home
 dar nidharn ke duusare daur ke kram main yah dekha gaya ki pratibhaagiyon ne un upkarnon ke dar ko badha diya he jinhen unhone chunaa he or un itamon ke dar ko kam kar diya he jise unhone asweekaar kar diya he
 This can be explained as cognitive dissonance
 jab ek kathin nirnay lenaa padataa he, tab asweekaar vastu ke pahalu hi khud ko pasand aate hai or yah vishistataaen kuch or chunane ke saath asangat hoti hai
 In other words, this feeling, "I chose X", is inconsistent with the feeling that, "Y has some things i like
" " haalia anusandhanon ne isi prakaar ke parinaam chaar-varshiya-bachche or kalgidaar bandar main paae hai
 Disorganization occurs when a person voluntarily engages in an unpleasant activity in order to achieve some desired goal
 asangati ko, lakshya kii vaanchhneeyata atishyokti dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Aronson and Mills had individuals undergo "a severe or mild initiation" to become a member of the group
 In critical-initiation condition, individuals are engaged in a shameful activity
 samooh niklaa bahut hi sust or ubaau ho
 gambhir-diksha adhik saumy diksha haalat main vyaktiyon kii tulana main dilachasp ke rup main samooh kaa moolyankan haalat main vyaktiyon
 The above criteria continue to be used in research useful to all
 haath dhone kii ek sthiti se ganda kaaran dikhaaya gaya he ko samaapt karne ke baad disisnal matbhed, shaayad kyonki aksar matbhed dwaara ghrinaa naitik 
 Daryl was an early critic of cognitive dissonance theory
 He proposed experimental alternative descriptions of the results of self-perception as a more economical theory
 As per Part time, people do not feel much about their behavior, whether they are in conflict alone
 kaarylay fasetinjar or carlsmith adhyayan yaa unke vyavhaar se unke nazariye infring ke rup main prerit anupaalan pratimaan main logon vyakhya kii
 is prakaar, jab poocha, "kya aap kaary dilachasp mila?" ve faisla kiya he ki ve yah dilachasp he ki ve kya kisi ko bataaya kyonki paaya hoga
 kaarylay kaa suzav diya he ki logon ko $ 20 kaa bhugtan kiya tha ek pramukh vyavhaar ke liye unke protsaahan, bahari or sambhaavna the paaya gaya he ki ve vastav main samaapan ke bajaay, ke liye anubhav dilachasp kaam tha kah rahi paise ke rup main unke kaaran ke liye yah dilachasp he
 In many situations, experimental theory and Festinger's theory of incompatibility is similar to prediction, but only the principle of incompatibility is the presence of araussal stress or unpleasant prediction
 Laboratory experiments have verified the presence of differences in arussal conditions
 This provides support for the theory of cognitive dissonance and makes it likely that self-perception can account for all laboratory findings
 1969 main, iliyat aronson avadharana swayan ise riformulated jodne buniyadi siddhant ke dwaara
 is nai vyakhya ke anusaar, sangyanatmak asangati nahin uthta kyonki log paraspar virdohi kaaganishan ke bich matbhed kaa anubhav
 iske bajaay, yah tab hota he jab logon ko apane swayan ke saamaanya rup se sakaaratmak drushtikon ke saath paraspar virdohi ke rup main unke kaaryon ko dekhte hai
 Thus, the origins of the paradigm about the paradigm and the use of the compliance-karlsmith study inspired, Aronson said, that the difference was between cognition, "I was a cognition an honest person" and "I, lied about finding interesting work for someone
" "
 Other psychologists maintain that the cognitive concept of maintaining stability is a self-image, but rather the way in which the public for personal self-defense
 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan, kupar or phegio ki besuraapan tark tha aversive parinaam he, bajaay visangati ke kaaran hota
 is vyakhya ke anusaar karne ke liye, yah tathy he ki jhooth bol rahi he galat or hanikaarak, bich koganishans visangati kya nahin he banaata he logon ko bura lagata he
 Subsequent research, however, found that people experience differences even when they feel they have done nothing wrong
 udhaaharan ke liye or unke chaatro aronson dikhaaya he ki logon ke anubhav bhi matbhed ke apane parinaamon ko jab bayaan kar rahe hai phydemand - ke rup main manaane kii jab ve yon sakriy chaatro kaa upyog kar kaa upyog karne ke condom, jab ve khud nahin kar rahe hai, condom Chen and colleagues' paradigm choice is criticism-free and suggested that the choice, rank "disharmony study method" rank is invalid
 unka tark he ki anusandhan dizin dharna par nirbhar karata he ki, agar doosraa surveykshan main vishay daron alag vikalp he, to he isliye badal vikalpon kii ore vishay ke drushtikon
 ve bataate hai ki vahaan anya kaarnon se ek alag ranking main mil saktaa he doosraa surveykshan shaayad vishyon bade paimaane par vikalpon ke bich udasin the
 However, some follow-up research has provided contradictory evidence to this account
 sangyaan ke tantrika network model ne sangyanatmak asangati or drushtikon par kiye gaye anubhavjanya anusandhan ko drushtikon nirmaan or parivartan kii vyakhya ke ek model main ekikrut karne ke liye aavashyak dhaancha pradaan kiya he
 Various neural network models have been developed to predict how cognitive dissonance affects an individual's attitude and behavior
 inamen shaamil hai: Using the fmri, van Veen and colleagues investigated the neural basis of cognitive dissonance in a modified version of the classic induced compliance paradigm
 While staying in the scanner, participants "argued" that the uncomfortable MRI environment was nonetheless a pleasant experience
 shodhakartaaon ne buniyadi prerit anupaalan nishkarshon ko doharaaya; ek prayogtmak samooh main pratibhaagiyon ne ek niyantran samooh scinar ke pratibhaagiyon kii tulana main jinhen sirf apane tark ke liye bhugtan kiya gaya zyada anand liya
 Importantly, responding from the counter-stance made the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insular cortex active; In addition, the extent to which these areas became active predicted the extent of change of attitude of individual participants
 Van Veen and his colleagues argue that these findings support Festinger's original anomaly theory and the "conflict theory" of advance cingulate functionality

 chamunda mata parvati kaa hi ek rup he
 There is a legend behind the mother's name Chamunda
 durga saptshati main mata ke naam kii utpatti katha varnit he
 Thousands of years ago, there was the rule of two demons named Shumbha and Nishumbha on the earth
 unke dwaara dharti va swarg par kaaphi atyaachaar kiya gaya
 As a result, the gods and humans worshiped Goddess Durga and Goddess Durga gave them a boon that she would definitely protect them from these two demons
 iske pashchaat devi durga ne koshiki naam se avatar grahan kiya
 The messengers of Shumbha and Nishumbha saw Mata Koshiki and said to both of them, Maharaj is the king of all the three lokas
 aapke yahaan par sabhi amuly ratna sushobhit he
 Indra's Eiravat elephant is also with you
 is kaaran aapke paas aisi divya or aakarshak nari bhi honi chahie jo ki teenon lokon main sarvasundar he
 Hearing this, Shumbha and Nishumbha sent one of their messengers to Goddess Koshiki and asked that angel to go to that beautiful place and say that Shumbha and Nishumbha are the kings of the three lokas and they both want to make you their queen
 yah sun doot mata koshiki ke paas gaya or dono daityo dwaara kahe gayi vachan mata ko suna diye
 Mother said that i believe that both Shumbha and Nishumbha are great forces
 parantu main ek pran le chunki hum ki jo vyakti mujhe yuddh main haraa degaa main usee se vivaah karuungi
 All these things the angel told Shumbha and Nishumbh
 to vah dono koshiki ke vachan sun kar us par krodhit ho gayi or kaha us nari kaa yah dussaahas ki vah hamen yuddh ke liye lalakaare
 Then he sent two asuras named Chand and Mund and said that take his hair and bring it to us
 chand or mund devi koshiki ke paas gayi or use apane saath chalane ke liye kaha
 When the goddess refused, he attacked the goddess
 tab devi ne apana kaali rup dhaaran kar liya or asuro ko yamalok pahunchaa diya
 The mother's name became Chamunda due to killing both of them

 Both Chhattisgarhi and Awadhi were born in the ninth-tenth century from Ardhamagadhi's womb about 1080 years ago

 That is why language and literature flourish simultaneously
 parantu ham dekhte he ki chhattisgadhi likhit sahitya ke vikaas ateet main spasht rup main nahin hui he
 Many writers believe that the reason is that in the past, the writers here made Sanskrit the medium of writing and remained a bit indifferent to Chhattisgarhi
 isiilie chhattisgadhi bhashaa main jo sahitya rachaa gaya, vah kareeb ek hazaar saal se hua he
 Many writers have divided this one thousand years in this way: yah vibhaajan kisi pravriti kii saapekshik adhikta ko dekhakar kiya gaya he
 Another noteworthy fact is that in other Aryan languages, even in Chhattisgarhi, only the poetic works have been done till the medieval period

 The kidneys participate in homeostasis of the entire body by controlling acid-base balance, electrolyte concentration, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure
 gurde in homeostatic kaaryon ko swatantra rup se va anya angon, vishishtatah antahsravi tantra ke angon, ke saath milakar, donon hi prakaar se purna karte hai
 The fulfillment of these endocrine functions requires synergy between various endocrine hormones, including renin, angiotensis II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and articular natriuretic peptide, etc
 gurde ke kaaryon main se anek kaary nefron main hone vaale parishodhan, punarvasoshana or srav kii apekshaakrit saral karypranaliyon ke dwaara purna kiye jate hai
 Refining, which occurs in the renal corpuscle, is a process by which cells and large proteins are filtered from the blood and an ultrafiltrate is formed, which will eventually form urine

 When osmolality increases, this gland secretes the antidiuretic hormone ADH, resulting in water reabsorption by the kidneys and increased urine concentration
 ye donon kaarak ek saath kaary karke plasma kii parasaraniyata ko punah saamaanya staron par laate hai
 ADH attaches to the main cells located in the collecting duct, which transports aquaporin to the marrow, so that water can normally release the impermeable marrow, and it can be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa reacta, which increases the amount of plasma in the body
 is
 aisi do pranaliyaan hai, jo atiparasarniya majja kaa nirmaan karti hai or is prakaar sharir main plasma kii maatra ko badhaati hai: uria punarchakran tathaa ‘ekal prabhaav 
' Urea is usually excreted from the kidneys as a waste material
 haalanki, jab plasma rakt-maatra kam hoti he or adiech choda jaataa he, to isse khulne vaale equaporins bhi uria ke prati bhedya hote hai
 This allows urea to form a hyperosmotic solution that 'attracts' water by leaving a hyper collecting tube and entering the medulla
 iske baad uria nefron main punah pravesh kar saktaa he or is aadhaar par ise punah utsarjit yaa punarchakrit kiya ja saktaa he ki adiech abhi bhi upasthit he yaa nahin
 The 'single effect' describes the fact that the thick ascending limb of the Loops of Henley is not permeable by water, but is permeable by earth

 Long-term blood pressure control is mainly dependent on the kidneys
 mukhyatah aisa koshiketar drav upkhand ke anurakshan ke madhyam se hota he, jiskaa aakar plasma sodium sandrata par nirbhar karata he
 However, the kidneys cannot directly estimate blood pressure, but changes in the delivery of sodium and chloride to the distal parts of the nephron alter the secretion of the renal fermentin used by the kidney
 jab koshiketar drav upkhand vistaarit ho or raktchaap ucch ho, to in yanon kii supurdagee bad jaati he or renin kaa srav ghat jaataa he
 Similarly, when the extracellular fluid subdivision is compressed and blood pressure is low, the delivery of sodium and chloride decreases and the renin secretion increases in response
 renin un rasinic sandeshvaahakon kii shrinkhalaa kaa pehla sadsy he, jo milakar renin-angiotencin tantra kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Changes in renin eventually alter the output of this mechanism, mainly angiotensin II and aldosteron
 prayek hormone anek karypranaliyon ke madhyam se kaary karata he, lekin donon hi gurde dwaara kiye jane vaale sodium chloride ke avasorana ko badhaate hai, jisase koshiketar drav upkhand kaa vistaar hota he or raktchaap badhata he
 When renin levels are increased, the concentration of angiotensin II and aldosterone increases, resulting in increased reabsorption of sodium chloride, expansion of extracellular fluid subdivision, and increased blood pressure
 iske vipareet, jab renin ke str nimna hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron ke str ghat jate hai, jisase koshiketar drav upkhand kaa sankuchan hota he or raktchaap main kami aati he
 The kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, calcitriol, and renin
 arethropitin ko vrikkeey pravaah main hypoxia kii pratikriya ke rup main choda jaataa he
 It catalyzes erythropoiesis in the bone marrow
 calcetriol, vitamin di kaa utprerit rup, calcium ke antra avasorana tathaa phosphate ke vrikkeey punarvasoshana ko protsaahit karata he
 Renin, which is part of the renin – angiotensin – aldosteron mechanism, is an enzyme involved in the control of aldosteron levels
 stanpayi jeevon main gurde kaa vikaas madhyavarti mesoderm se hota he
 The development of the kidney, also known as nephrogenesis, passes through three successive stages, each of which is marked by the development of a more advanced pair of kidneys: pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros

 In most vertebrate organisms, mesonephros is transformed into an adult kidney, although it is often associated with more advanced metanephroses; In amniote only the mesonephros is restricted to the embryo
 machhlee or ubhaycharon ke gurde vishisht rup se sankare, lambey ang hote hai, jo dhad kaa ek bahut bada bhaag gher lete hai
 The collecting tubes of each flock of nephrons are emptied into an archinephric tube, which resembles the habitat defenses of amniote organisms
 haalanki, yah sthiti sadaiv hi saral nahin hoti; upasthissom machhliyon main or kuch ubhaycharon main, emniot jeevon main pai jane vaali mutrvahini ke samaan, ek choti nalika hoti he, jo gurde ke pichley bhaagon ko rikt karti he or mutrashay yaa mori par archinephric nalika se jud jaati he
 In fact, in many adult cartilage fishes, the anterior part of the kidney may be deformed or stop functioning altogether
 sarvaadhik aadim kasheruki jeevon, hegfish or lampre main, gurde kii sanrachana asaadhaaran rup se saral hoti he: yah nefron kii ek pankti se milakar banati he, jinamein se prayek sidhe archinephric nalika main rikt hota he
 Invertebrates may have excretory organs that are sometimes referred to as "kidneys", but, even in amphioxus, they never resemble the kidneys of vertebrates and more accurately Other names, such as nephridia, are used for them
 sarisrupon ke gurde anek khandon se bane hote hai, jo ki mote taur par ek rekhiy pattern main vyavasthit hote hai
 There is a single branch of the ureter in the center of each segment, in which the collecting duct is empty
 sarisrupon main usee aakaar ke anya amniot jeevon kii tulana main apekshaakrit kam nefron hote hai, sambhawatah isaliye kyonki unamem chayapachay kii dar nimna hoti he
 Birds have relatively large, long kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct segments
 ye khand anek chote, aniyamit rup se vyavasthit khandon se milakar bane hote hai, jinamein se prayek mutrvahini kii ek shakha par kendrit hota he
 The glomeruli of birds are small in size, but the number of nephrons in them is nearly double that of mammals
 maanav gurda stanpayi jeevon kaa ek bahut vishisht udhaaharan he
 Typical features of the mammalian kidney, compared to other vertebrate organisms, include the presence of the renal pelvis and renal pyramids, and the presence of a clearly identifiable bark and marrow
 baad vaala lakshan lups of henle ke bade aakaar kii upasthiti ke kaaran hota he; pakshiyon main ye bahut chote hote hai or anya kasheruki jeevon main vastutah ye nahin paye jate

 baapu asaramji ke adhivaktaa ne daawa kiya he ki peedit ladki us samay naaballig nahin thi jis samay usne manai gaanv, jodhpur main asaramji baapu par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha 
 He gave examples of several cases of High Court and Supreme Court saying that life insurance is a legal document which is sufficient evidence in any age related dispute in law
 ladki kii maan ne jo jivan beemaa kharidi thi usamen ladki kii janm dinaank 1 / 7 / 1994 ullekith he or is janm dinaank ke mutabik ladki ne jis samay kaa aarope lagaaya he us samay wo naaballig nahin thi balki 19 saal se zyada kii ho chuki thi
 So on what basis was the act imposed on Sant Asaramji Bapu? adhivaktaa sajjanraj surana ne yah bhi kaha ki ladki kii umr sambandhi alag-alag dastavejon main antar hone ke baavjood abhiyojan paksh ne isaki parvaah nahin kii or kisi adhikrut adhikari se un dastavejon main jo umr sambandhi antar aa rahaa tha, uski jaanch nahin karwaai
 Bapu Asaramji of Manai Farm House was not a trustee 

 bachaav paksh adhivaktaa ne aage bahes jari rakhte hue kaha ki agar baapu aashaaraamji jodhpur manai farm house ke trustee the, to abhiyojan paksh ne is sambandh main koi saboot pesh kyon nahin kii? agar koi vishwaas yogya hoti to register hoti, koi vyakti aakar usko sabit karata, parantu kaa koi documentt pesh nahin hua
 Therefore, the allegations made about being trustees have zero value
