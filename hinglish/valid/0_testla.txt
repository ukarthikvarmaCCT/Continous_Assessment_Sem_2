 Self has been used to guide sentient beings
 " The scripture Ratnagotra department associated with this, states that the teachings of the Tathagatagarbha are intended to win over sentient beings and to end "self-association" - one of the five deficiencies of non-buddhist teaching
 Yoru Wang in the Lankavatara Sutra also finds the use of a similar language, then writes: "seeing that this reference is necessary
 ye hamen is nishkarsh par pahunchane se rokegaa ki tathagatagarbha ke vichaar se ye sirf ek parloukik kalpana bhar thi
 "however, some people have objected to this conclusion associated with the Mahaparinirvana Sutra and claimed that the Buddha proclaimed that he was himself, emphasizing his own reality in these lines: 'kai kaarnon or paristhitiyon ke chalate maine bhi ye shiksha di ki swayan hi swayan se pare he
 While it is actually myself, i have taught that there is no self but there is nothing wrong with it
 buddha-dhaatu sravayan rahit he
 When the Tathagata teach that there is no self, they do this because of eternity
 tathagat swayan hai or wo swayan nahin hone kii shiksha dete hai kyonki unhone samprabhutaa kii prapti kar lee he
 ' nirvana sutara main buddha ne kaha he ki ab vah ab tak gopneey rakhe gaye siddhanton kii shiksha denge or gaiyr-swayan par unki pehle di gai shiksha auchity ke aadhaar par hi thi
 Dr
 Kosho Yamamoto writes: 'vah kehete hai ki gaiyr-swayan jo unhone pehle sikhaaya tha wo kuch or nahin balki us paripekshya main auchity bhar he
 

he also told that now he is ready to talk about confidential knowledge
 vyakti sire se ulat vichaaron kaa bhi paalan karata he
 So now he will talk about the positive qualities of nirvana, which is nothing but eternal, joy and pure
 ' According to some scholars, the language used in the Sutras of Tathagatagarbha nature emphasizes Buddhist teaching from dependent origins in positive language, so that people do not turn away from Buddhism and do not understand this teaching as Nihilism
 
 For example, in some sutras full knowledge of non-self is called the true self; The ultimate goal of this path is again explained in a very positive language that has been used in the philosophy of India, but now it has been made part of the new Buddhist vocabulary to explain the person who taught the Buddhist path Successfully completed
 dow yamamoto bataate hai ki nirvana kaa 'sakaaratmak' chithran asal main ek ucch koti ke nirvana se judaa hua he - jise 'mahanirvana' kehete hai
 Talking about the text 'bodhisattva the great divine king' of the Nirvana Sutra, Yamamoto himself resorts to the scripture: 'what is Nirvana? 


 It is like this that a hungry person gets that peace and happiness as if some food has gone in his stomach
 ' Yamamoto continues the quote, adding his own commentary as well: "lekin, aise nirvana ko "mahanirvana" nahin kaha ja saktaa"
 or wo "maha swayan", "maha harsh" or "maha shuddhta" par bhi chintan karte hai jo sabhi sanathan kii tarah hi maha nirvana ke chaar gun hai
 ' kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar, "swayan" kii yahaan or sambandhit sutron main vyakhya asal main paryaapt swayan kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karti he
 Indeed, it is an expression of emptiness in a positive language and indicative of the attainment of enlightenment through Buddhist practices
 is drushtikon main 'tathagatagarbha' / buddha kii shiksha kaa dhyey mukti-shastravaadi he na ki saidhantik
 However, this interpretation is controversial
 sabhi vidwaanon kaa yah mat nahin he
 Writing on the diverse knowledge of the Tathagatarbha doctrine in the Nirvana Sutra and related scriptures, Dr
 Jamie Hubbard says how some scholars find inclination towards the nature of ultimate elementalism and monotheism in the Tathagagarbha
 Dr
 Hubbard's comments: 'matsumoto ki behad sakaaratmak bhashaa or tathagatagarbha shaastra main gyaan ke prerak tareeke main kai samanthaayen hai
 At the same time he showed sufficient monotheism in the Atman / Brahmin tradition
 Apparently, Matsumoto only mentioned this similarity, it is not
 udhaaharan ke liye, takasaki jikido jo tathagatagarbha parampara ke prakand vidwaan maane jate hai, unhone tathagatagarbha or mahayan ke siddhaton main advaitvaad ko dekha


obermiller ne apane anuwaad main advait param siddhant kii dharna ko tathagatagarbha parampara se jodakar dekha or unhone ratnagotra par tippanee kii, jiskaa unhone bade hi sateek tareeke se "buddha advaitvaad kii niyam pustika" ke taur par namakaran kiya
 

lamotte and Frauwolner contrasted the Tathagatagarbha doctrine with the Madhyamika and they associated it with the monotheism of the Atman / Brahman, while some such as Ngao, Seafort Royg and Johnston only voiced their doubts and said that it was at the time of the Vedas
 Corresponds to the later monotheism
 ek or mat jiskaa pratinidhitiv yamaguchi susumu or unke chaatr ogava ichijo karte hai, unhone tathagatagarbha ko vaidic vichaaron ke bina hi samajhane main safalataa pai or unhone use riktata or kaarantv kii buddha parampara main hi paaya jo kisi bhi tarah ke advaitvaad ko sire se nakaarte hai
 Obviously, the questions related to the monotheism or eternal nature of the Tathagatagarbha and Buddhist tradition are complex
 dow habird in shabdon ke saath tathagatagarbha ke siddhanton par apane shodh kaa saar rakhte hai: 'knowledge of the Tathagatagarbha has always been a matter of debate, because he has a very positive positive approach to truth and knowledge, not a description of reality in a negative context, that is, not in terms of what it is lacking or vacancy, but as positive description ' paul williams ke anusaar, atman / brahman vichaar ke advaitvaad main ekarupata samajhaaii ja sakati he
 When Nirvana Sutras put forth their teachings to conquer non-buddhist monks: is samay buddha dharm par hindu prabhaav ke bare main bada rochak lagata he
 But it is very easy to just talk about the effects
 

 ye kehete hue mahaparinirvana sutara khud hi ek prakaar se hindu prabhaav kii baat maanata he, jab wo buddha ko 'swayan' kaa istemaal karte hue gaiyr-buddha saadhuon ko jeetne kii baat karata he
 Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that the outstanding self-brahmin of Advaita Vedanta influenced Buddhism at this time
 ye kahin bhi spasht nahin he ki swayan jiskaa mahaparinirvana sutara main arth he swayanrahit kii kahin bhi advait brahman se tulana kii ja sakati he or vaise bhi ye tathagatagarbha sutara goud pad, jise hindu advait mat kaa sansthaapak kaha jaataa he, usase bhi purana he
 The sutra also says that the nature of the Buddha is truly voiceless, but on the basis of interaction it is called itself
 isi sutara ke duusare khand main, yah kaha gaya he ki teen tareeke hai, jinase vyakti kuch "paa" saktaa he; purv main paanaa, vartmaan main paanaa or bhavishya main paanaa
 usamen kaha gaya he ki "sabhi main buddha kii prakruti he" kaa aashay he ki sabhi bhavishya main ja kar buddha ban jaaenge

 haalanki, dojan ne saaf kaha he ki buddha kii prakruti kuch sandarbhon main vartmaan main bhi maujuud he yahaan tak ki gaiyr-buddha main bhi: asal main vaastaviktaa ko vartmaan se tulana karnaa ise buddha prakruti se joda gaya, jisamen ghaas, ped, man or sharir sabhi ko shaamil kiya gaya
 To dozan is to see anything or see the nature of Buddha
 jabaki chinul kaa mat he ki ye sharir main soonghney or dekhne kii kshamta kii tarah vidyaman he
 The important Lankavatara Sutra states that all actions are due to the nature of Buddha, the destiny of every karma is the cause and root
 jaisaa ki upar sujhaayaa gaya he japani jine guru dojan ne buddha prakruti kii bilkul alag vyakhya kii he, jisamen 'sampurna swaroop' ko buddha prakruti ke taur par dekha jaataa he or kuch bhi isse alag nahin
 buddha kii prakruti sirf 'buddha hone kii kshamta' bhar nahin he, balki sansar kii har vastu kii prakruti yahi he
 All things are seen as Buddha nature in their impermanence and they are not proof of 'ability' for any Buddha nature
 dow masao abe is samaj par likhte hai: '


 In Dozen's understanding, Buddha nature is not a proof of any ability, it is not a seed that every sensitive person has
 Rather every sensitive person, or say everything, living or dead, is actually Buddha nature
 ye koi kshamta nahin he jo bhavishya main rup dikhaaegi, har vastu kii mul prakruti yahi he
 Dozen thus encompassed almost everything, extending the scope of the idea of buddha nature and 'sentient beings', all those things which are alive, which have intelligence and which are Buddha nature itself
 dow masao abeiski vyakhya karte hai: '


 Dozen has not only expanded the scope of the meaning of Buddha nature, but has also given greater scope to sensitive people
 " busho " main, "sampurna vyaktitv hi buddha kii prakruti he
 "immediately after saying this, he says," i consider the whole person's unit of 'sentient beings' inseparable "


 that is, the Dozen has expanded the scope of Xuzhou, which is traditionally meant only for living or sentient beings Used to now include dead and insensitive objects
 duusare shabdon main, unhone mrit vastuon main jivan dekar asamvedansheel vastuon main bhavanaaen dekar or ant main sabhi main buddha or buddha prakruti dene kii baat kahi he
 '
 jain dharm main iskaa arth he karm ke aakhri bandhan khol dena
 jab ek prabud maanav jaise ki ek arihant yaa tirthankar apane shesh adhatiya karmon / aghaty karm ko nasht kar dete hai is tarah apane sansaarik astitv ko samaapt karte hai, tab is avasthaa ko nirvana kaha jaataa he
 Technically, the renunciation of the body of an Arihant or the death of their body is called nirvana, because they have ended their existence in the world and attained liberation
 moksh yani, mukti ke baad nirvana kii prapti hoti he
 After the attainment of nirvana, an Arihant becomes perfect, a liberated person
 jain dharm main nirvana kaa arth he: Those who believe in Jainism celebrate Diwali as the 24th Tirthankara Mahavir Bhagwan's Nirvana Kalyanak Day
 nirvana diwas ko jainagam main 'nirvana kalyanak diwas ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to the Shvetambara belief, Kalpasutra contains detailed information on Mahavira's nirvana
 shwetambar manyata anusaar uttaradhyaan sutara main bataaya gaya he ki kis tarah gautam ne kasee ko, jo parshv ke shishy the, nirvana kaa arth samajhaayaa

 tomars yaa tanvar uttar pashchim bharat kaa ek rajput vansh tha
 Tomaro believes that she is Chandravanshi
 inhone vartmaan dilli kii sthapana dihilika kenam se kii thi
 From the Puranas, it appears that initially the Tomars were inhabited in some northern region near the Himalayas
 kintu 10veen shatabdi tak ye karnal tak pahunch chuke the
 He also ruled in Thaneshwar
 us samay uttar bharat main kanyakubj ke rajput rajwansh kaa samrajya tha
 As their feudal lords, the Tanvaras started moving towards the south
 dilli main unke adhikaar kaa samay anishchit he
 But in the 10th and 11th centuries of Vikram, we find mention of the struggle of the Chauhans and Tomars of the century
 tomaresh rudra chouhan raja chandan ke haathon maaraa gaya
 Tantrapal Tomar Chauhan was defeated by the orator
 vaakpati ke putr singhraj ne tomaresh salvan kaa vadh kiya
 But Chauhan Singhraj was also killed after some time
 bahut sambhav he ki singhraj kii mrityu main tomaron kaa kuch haath rahaa ho
 Tomar appears to have become the lord of Delhi at this time
 tanvar rajput ke 12 gaanv dilli fahtepur ke aas paas he gazanvi vansh ke aarambhik akramanon ke samay dilli-thaneshwar kaa tomars vansh paryaapt samunnat avasthaa main tha
 Tomaraj also tried to save Thaneshwar from Mahmud, though he did not succeed
 san 1038 itho mahmud ke putr masood ne haansi par adhikaar kar liya
 Masood's son Mazdud subdued Thaneshwar
 dilli par akraman kii taiyaari hone lagi
 It seemed that the Muslims would not take rest without abolishing the Delhi state
 kintu tomaron ne saahas se kaam liya
 Tomaraj Mahipal did not accept only the fortifications of Hansi and Thaneshwar; His gallant corps also hoisted his victory over Kangde for some time
 lahore bhi tanwaron ke haathon se bhagyavshaat hi batch gaya
 This victory of the Tomars led to envy only
 tomaron par idhar udhar se akraman hone lage
 The towers answered them as soon as possible
 sanwat 1189 main rachit shridhar kavi ke parsvanathacharit se prathit hota he ki us samay tomaron kii rajdhani dilli samrudh nagari thi or tanvarraj anangpal apane shaury aadi gunon ke kaaran sarvatra vikhyath tha

 shaayad isi raja ke samay tanwaron ne apni niti badali
 In 1208 Bisaldev III defeated the Tomars and captured Delhi
 iske baad tanvar chouhanon ke saamanton ke rup main dilli main rajya karte rahe
 After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan, Delhi was ruled by Muslims
 firozshah tughlaq ke samay gwalior par tanwaron kii ek duusari shakha ne adhikaar kiya
 It ruled here for about 150 years
 tanvarraj ramsah maharana pratap ke paksh main ladata hua apane do putron sahit haldighati ke prasiddh yuddh main kaam aayaa
 The towers of Gwalior have done enough work to preserve art, literature and culture

 The history of Bank of America dates back to 1904, when Amadio Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco to provide banking services to migrants whom other banks did not serve
 emadio ke pita ko 10 dollar karj kii raashi jutaney ke prayaas main goli maar di gayi thi
 He was then raised by the Fava / Stangellini family
 1906 main jab san francisco kaa bhayankar bukamp aayaa, jiyaanini bank ke bhawan se samast jamaa raashi baahar nikaal laane or ise aag se bachaane main safal rahe
 chunki san francisco ke bank dahakate avasheshon main badalakar rah gayi the or ve apane walts ko bhi nahin khol paye the, jabaki jiyaanini ne is vinashlila ke kuch hi dinon ke andar bachi hui raashi kaa upyog karte hue isse udhaar dena shuru kar diya

 compton prabhaav ucch aavriti ke vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kii padaarth ke saath vah ant:kriya he jisamen mukt electranon se prakeern hokar photaan kii urja main hraas ho jaataa he or unke tarang aayam main vruddhi ho jaati he
 The wavelength of the scattering radiation depends only on the angle of scattering
 compton prabhaav ke spashtikaran ke liye 1923 i
 main kaanpton or debaai ne swatantra rup se yah dharna apanaai ki kisi disha main chalate hue photaan main jo urja / samveg hota he unka kul Or may give only a small portion
 isse prakeern photaan kii urja, jisamen plank sthiraank he or vikiran kii aavriti he, apati photaan kii urja se kam hoti he or photaan se sambandhit tarangaayam bad jaataa he
 This is clearly contrary to the wave theory of photon-electron-collision-pattern radiation
 san 1924 i
 main bor, creckers or slator ne ek duusare praturup kaa suzav rakhaa jo tarangvaad par aadhaarit tha
 In this model, the laws of energy stability and momentum are applied only to the statistical mean of multiple collisions, rather than to any solitary interaction of radiation and electrons
 atev apati vikiran tamson ke tarangavaadi praturup ke anuroop satat prakeern hota he, par saath main kabhi-kabhi ek pratikshep electron bhi prakirnak se nikalataa he
 This model was successful in explaining the increase in wavelength due to the vibrational result, but ultimately became invalid on the basis of some experimental results, and only the photon – electron – collision-model of validation, computation, and debi was found
 kaanpton-debaai-praturup ke anusaar pratikshipt electron or prakeern vikiran kaa utpaadan saath hi saath hona aavashyak he
 According to quantum mechanics in this simultaneity, the time uncertainty is about 10–21 seconds and in the latest experiments, the time constant has reached close enough to this limit
 kaanpton-debaai ke photaan praturup main urja or samveg kii sthirataa kaa upyog karke pratikshipt electron or prakeern photaan kii dishaao main ek yatharth sambandh miltaa he
 This relationship is satisfactorily confirmed by modern experiments
 dirack kii kwantum yantriki ke siddhanton ke anusaar vidyucchumbakeey kshetra or ek electron ke bich ant: kriya kaa spashtikaran purnat: bhinn rup se kiya gaya he
 In this model, in addition to the initial and final positions of the interaction, there is also a medium state, in which only the momentum remains constant, not energy
 is ant:sth sthiti main ek electron ek photaan ko utshaarit kar saktaa he yaa ek photaan kaa avasorana kar saktaa he
 Thus, there is a possibility of two options in the Kapton result: in donon vikalpon kaa vichaar karke electron ke vidyucchumbakeey vikiran ke prakirnan kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he or usase jo nishkarsh nikle hai ve aadhunik prayogon dwaara urja ke paryaapt vistaar ke liye siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 The conclusions of compton-debai are particular forms of this general conclusion
 yadi prakeern padaarth main ham electron kii purnataya swadhin or sthir maane or yadi apati photaan kii urja ho or prakeern photaan kii urja ho, to urja sthirataa or samveg sthirataa ke niyamon kaa upyog karke hamen nimnlikhit sameekaran milte hai : Where h⁄mec ko electron kaa compton tarangadairghy kehete hai; iskaa maan 2

 prayek laghu-film kii kathavstu aam taur par jeri ko pakadaney ke liye tom ke asankhya prayaason or parinamswaroop hui hathapayee or tabaahi par aadhaarit he
 Because Tom seldom attempts to eat Jerry, and since some of the cartoon shorts seem to pair really well with each other, it's still unclear why Tom, Jerry's So much follows
 prastut kuch kaarnon main saamaanya chaalaaki / chuhon ke prati bair, apane maalik ke aadeshaanusaar duty, tom ko saunpe gaye kaaryon ko jeri dwaara bigaadane kii koshish, jeri dwaara tom ke maalik kaa bhojan kha janaa, jisaki nigaraanee kaa jimmaa tom ko saunpa gaya he, badale kii bhaavana, jeri dwaara tom ke anya sambhavit shikaron ko khaae jane se bachaana, duusari billi se pratispardhaa or tom dwaara chaalaak mohini billiyon ko bahakaane kii koshishon ko naakaam karnaa, jo anya kaarnon ke alaava jeri ghrinaa yaa irshyaavash karata he
 Tom rarely succeeds in capturing Jerry because of Jerry's cunning, clever abilities and luck

 There are many such illustrations in cartoons, where they express genuine friendship and concern for each other's well being
 laghu-film ke kuch ank theatre anemation main izad kiye gaye kuch zordaar parihaason ke liye mashhoor hai: jeri kaa tom ke do tukade kar dena, uskaa sir khidki yaa daravaaje main band kar dena, tom dwaara kulhadi, pistaul, visphotakon, fandon or zehar se jeri kii hatya kii koshish karnaa, vaifal aayran main tom kii poonch thunsna, use refrigerator main dhakelnaa, uski poonch ko bijli ke socket main lagaana, use sonta, chadi yaa bada hathoda lekar jor se maarthe hue, ek ped athwa ek bijli ke khambhe se use zamin par giraanaa, uske pairon main maachis kii tilia chipka kar unhen jalaana aadi
 Despite the popularity, Tom and Jerry have often been criticized as overly violent
 :42 :134 lagaataar hinsa kii ghatnaon ke baavjood, mul cartoonon ke kisi bhi drishy main koon athwa jamaa hua koon nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 However, in a very rare instance, when Tom cuts to pieces in the opening nomenclature of Tom and Jerry: The Movie, the blood can be clearly seen

 The cartoon is also notable for its dependence on the unchanged form, such as darkening the characters after the explosion and the use of heavy and large shadows

 Although many of the supporting and minor characters interact, Tom and Jerry rarely do so
 Tom, famously, sings the song while courting the cat; For example, in the 1946 short-film Solid Serenade, Tom Lewis sings Jordan's "is You Or Is You Ain't My Baby" song

 As stated above, Butch, a black badge in the street, also wants to catch Jerry and eat

 However, almost all of the digits in which he appears have been enmity with Tom due to his toadal

 Producer Fred Quimby, who runs the MGM animation studio, immediately dropped Hanna and Barbara from other one-shot cartoons he was working on and created a series based on cat and mouse

 In the early 1940s, Tom's outline included many details — feathers, multiple wrinkles on the face, multiple eyebrows — that were more streamlined by the late 1940s and looked like a real cat
 Started giving; In addition to the introduction of his quadrupeds, Tom grew and eventually became nearly two-legged

 Since the original short films by Tom and Jerry were rarely seen by the Ditch / Cinder crew, the resulting films were against the trend and in many ways considered absurd
 kirdaaron ke haav-bhav praayah tej gati se pradarshit kiye gaye, jiske kaaran unki chaal bahut hi dhundhale dikhaai di
 As a result, the animation of the characters felt baffling and sick
 The soundtrack consisted of sparse music, blank sound effects and dialogue, which were mostly whispered and echoes were used instead of speaking

 Tom's fans criticized Ditch's cartoons, with Jerry never intimidating Tom

 Tom's new boss, a burly white man, was shown to be more brutal in punishing Tom's mistakes than Mammy Shoes, such as beating Tom repeatedly and hitting him with a stick, piercing his face with a grill, and Forcing Tom to drink carbonated drinks

 Jones had trouble adapting his style of Tom and Jerry humor, and in many cartoons, postures, personalities, and style were preferred over the plot
 The characters' formats were slightly altered: Tom was given slightly thicker Boris Carlaaf-like eyebrows, less intricate looks, sharp ears and furry cheeks, while Jerry had big eyes and ears, a light brown color, and a cute, fat boar like Howe

 saanchaa:bangla patrika Once the Maharaj of Hastinapur was doing penance on the banks of the Ganges
 unke rup-soundarya se mohit ho kar ganga jaangh par baith gayi
 Ganga said, "O Rajan! i am the daughter of the sage Ganga and have come to marry you
 " is par maharaj prateep bole, "gange! tum meri dahini jaangh par baithi ho
 The wife should be vamangi, right thigh is the symbol of the son, so i accept you as my daughter-in-law
 " yah sun kar ganga vahaan se chali gayi
 Now Maharaja Pratip started doing intense penance to get a son
 unke tap ke falswaroop unhen putr kii prapti hui jiskaa naam unhone shantanu rakhaa
 When Shantanu was young, Maharaja Pratipa went to heaven, ordering him to marry Ganga
 pita ke aadesh kaa paalan karne ke liye shantanu ne ganga ke paas jaakar unase vivaah karne ke liye nivedan kiya
 Ganga said, "rajan! i can marry you, but you have to promise that you will not interfere in any of my work
" " shantanu ne ganga ke kahe anusaar vachan de kar unase vivaah kar liya
 Maharaj Shantanu had eight sons from the Ganga's womb, out of which seven were taken away by Ganga into the Ganges river and due to his promise, Maharaj Shantanu could not speak anything
 jab ganga kaa aathvaan putr hua or vah use bhi nadi main bahaane ke liye le jane lagi to raja shantanu se rahaa na gaya or ve bole, "gange! tumne mere saat putron ko nadi main baha diya kintu apni pratigya ke anusaar maine kuch na kaha
 Now you are going to shed this eighth son of mine too
 main tumse prarthana karata hoon ki krupa karke ise nadi main mat bahaao
 On hearing this, Ganga said, "rajan! You have broken your vow so i can no longer be with you
 " itnaa kah kar ganga apane putr ke saath antardhyaan ho gayi
 After that Maharaj Shantanu spent thirty-six years wearing a Brahmacharya fast
 phir ek din unhone ganga ke kinare ja kar ganga se kaha, "gange! aaj meri ichha us balak ko dekhne kii ho rahi he jise tum apane saath le gai thim
 "ganga appeared as a beautiful woman with that child and said," Rajan! This is your son and its name is Devavrata, take it
 yah parakramee hone ke saath vidwaan bhi hoga
 In astrology it will be similar to Parashurama
 " maharaj shantanu apane putr devvrat ko paakar atyant prasann huye or use apane saath hastinapur laakar yuvaraj ghoshit kar diya
 One day Maharaj Shantanu was roaming on the banks of Yamuna that he saw a beautiful girl riding a boat in the river
 uske ang ang se sugandh nikal rahi thi
 Maharaj asked the girl, "oh God! Who are you?" The girl told, "maharaj! My name is Satyavati and i am a Nishad girl
 " maharaj uske rup yauvan par riz kar tatkaal uske pita ke paas pahunche or satyavati ke saath apane vivaah kaa prastaav kiya
 On this Dhinwar said, "rajan! i have no objection to my daughter marrying you, but you must make the son born of my daughter's womb the heir to your kingdom
" 
 "on hearing these words of Nishad, Maharaj Shantanu returned quietly to Hastinapur
 satyavati ke viyog main maharaj shantanu vyakul rahane lage
 His body became weaker day by day
 maharaj kii is dasha ko dekh kar devvrat ko badi chintaa hui
 When he came to know the reason of this type of father's condition by the ministers, he immediately went to Nishad's house with all the ministers and he said to Nishad, "O Nishad! You are happily married your daughter Satyavati to my father Shantanu
 Please do it
 main aapako vachan detaa hoon ki aapaki putree ke garbh se jo balak janm legaa vahi rajya kaa uttaradhikari hoga
 In the long run, if any of my children do not take away the rights of your daughter's children, i pledge that i will remain unmarried for a lifetime
 " unki is pratigya ko sun kar nishad ne haath jod kar kaha, "he devvrat! aapaki yah pratigya abhootpurv he
 "having said this, Nishad immediately sent his daughter Satyavati along with Devavrata and his ministers to Hastinapur
 devvrat ne apni mata satyavati ko laakar apane pita shantanu ko saunp diya
 The father was pleased and said to the son, "watts! You have pledged paternity, such a promise that no one has done till date and will not do in future
" main tuje vardaan detaa hoon ki teri mrityu teri ichha se hi hogi
 Because of your vows, you will be called Bhishma and your pledge will always be known as Bhishma pledge
 " There is no other hero like him in this world
