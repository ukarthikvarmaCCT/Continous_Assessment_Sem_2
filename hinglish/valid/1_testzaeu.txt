 lev trotsaki rus ke marxvaadi krantikari tathaa siddhantkaar, soviet rajaneta tathaa laal sena ke sansthaapak va pratham netaa the
 Trotsky commanded the Red Army, which was victorious in the fierce civil war that followed the Russian Revolution
 ek siddhantkaar ke rup main sthaayee kranti ke siddhanth ke jariye unhone marxvaadi vimarsh main yogadan kiya
 At the same time Trotsky also proposed a rule that the level of development of capitalism is not the same everywhere, which results in the simultaneous occurrence of two phases of social and historical development in backward countries
 beesvin sadi ke pehle dashak main marxvaadiyon ke bich chal rahe bahes-mubahise ke bich trotski kii is saidhantik uplabdhi ne rus jaise audyogic rup se pichde desh main kranti karne ke tark ko majbootee pradaan kii
 After Lenin's death, Trotsky opposed the principle of establishing socialism in a country promoted by Stalin, but he continued to fall alone in the struggle within the party
 pehle unhen party se nikaala gaya, or phir soviet rajya ke viruddh shadyantra karne ke aarope main desh-nikaala de diya gaya
 During the expulsion, Trotsky strongly criticized the Soviet Union being formed under Stalin, calling it a bureaucrat, autocratic and state capitalist state
 soviet sikret police se bachane ke liye sari duniya main bhatakate hue trotski ne 'permanent revolution', 'revolution bitrede' or teen khandon main 'da history of russian revolution' jaise clasik granth kii rachana kii
 In order to bring his dream of world revolution on earth, he also founded the Fourth Communist International, which did not get any special success
 nishkasana ke dauraan hi mexico main stallin ke ek agent ke haathon unhen jaan se haath dhonaa padaa
 Trotsky's followers have formed small communist parties in many countries of the world
 soviet style ke communism ke vikalp ke rup main unke vichaaron ko trotscvaad kii sangya mil chuki he
 Trotsky's real name was Lev Davidovich Bronstein
 bahut kam umr main hi ve marxvad ke prati aakarshith hue or bhumigat raajnneeti karte hue 'trotski' kaa gupt naam apana liya
 His life can be divided into three parts
 pehla hissaa vah he jab roosi marxvad ke ek swatantra hastakshar kii tarah ve krantikari andolan main bhaag lete hue pehle lenin ke najadik aaye or phir unka saath dene se inkaar kar diya
 The second part began from 1917 until 1923 when he pioneered the Soviet Revolution by joining shoulder to shoulder with Lenin
 iske baad unke jivan kaa teesraa daur shuru hua jab unhone kranti ke laabhon kii raksha karne ke liye stalinavaad ke kilaaf abhiyaan chhedaa
 Among Bolshevik leaders, Trotsky was the only one who was not seen as his follower despite being Lenin's main partner
 1903 main roosi saamaajik janavaadee majdoor party jab bolshevikon or menshavikon main vibhajit hui, to trotski ne lenin kaa saath nahin diya
 In the beginning, he condemned Bolshevism by saying that it was not a proletariat but a formula of dictatorship over the proletariat
 us samay unhen shaq tha ki lenin robsprre jaise shadyantrkaari netaa hai jinke kaaran rus kaa samaajawaadee andolan pathbhrasht ho jayega
 At the time, Trotsky was of the view that the goal of socialism cannot be achieved by commanding revolution in the hands of a disciplined party of professional revolutionaries doing secret political work
 ve ek adhik loktantric or khule charitra kii party banane ke paksh main the
 In 1905 he emerged as the Soviet leader of St
 Petersburg
 rus kii is pehali soviet ne 1905 kii kranti main pramukh bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya tha, or trotski ise pramanik loktantr kaa namoona maanate the
 After the revolution failed, the Tsarshi arrested him and sent him to Siberia
 trotski vahaan se bhaag nikle or aglaa dashak unhone europe main bitaayaa
 During this period he remained with the Mensheviks organizationally
 1917 main ve rus laute tab farvari kranti ke kaaran zaarshahi kaa patan ho chukaa tha
 Now he joined the Bolsheviks because he felt that there was a lot of similarity between his and Lenin's ideas
 swayan lenin trotski kii raajnneetik or saidhantik kshamtaaon ke prashansak the
 Trotsky grew in stature in the Bolshevik party
 unhone videshi maamalon ke kamisar ke taur par germanon ke saath shanti- vaarta main bhaag liya
 Trotsky, as a military commissar, played a major role in the formation of the Red Army and led him brilliantly in the Civil War
 in safaltaaon ke kaaran trotski ko lenin ke sambhavit uttaradhikariyon main ek ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Like Lenin, Trotsky had deep faith in the creative abilities of the Russian proletariat
 is vishwaas ke aadhaar main vishwa-poonjeewaad ke adhyayan se nikali unki ek vishesh tarah kii saidhantik samaj thi
 Trotsky was of the view that in order to get rid of its backwardness, no country needs to go through the steps that developed countries have gone through
 in deshon main pichhadepan ke saath-saath agadepan ke lakshan bhi ubharate hai
 Analyzing on the basis of this theory, Trotsky showed that much of Russia is backward and underdeveloped, but it has also been infiltrated by Western influences
 kai jagahon par aarthik utpaadan or sambandhon ke viksit taur-tareeke apanaae jane lage hai
 These moments of industrial development have created a considerable proletariat and a westernized intellectual elite in urban centers
 parinamswaroop raajnneetik pratirodh or sakriyata ke radical rup prachlit ho gayi hai
 Since industrialization is imposed from above, the local capitalist class is weak, but the proletariat is strong
 poonjeewaadi varg loktantric kranti karne se darataa he or apni aakshamata ke kaaran apana aitihaasik daayitv nahin nibhaa paa rahaa he, isliye yah jimmedaari sarvhaara varg ke kandhon par aa gayi he
 Taking the peasants under his leadership, the working class will have to move towards socialism by eradicating feudalism and all its remnants
 trotski ne apane siddhant ko sthaayee kranti qaraar diya
 In 1850, Marx used this position while addressing the General Council of the Communist League
 trotski ke mutabik praaq-poonjeewaadi maansikta vaale kisaan is krantikari prakriya main mazdooron kaa saath bahut dur tak nahin de paayenge
 Their interest will remain till they get the ownership of the land
 kisaanon ke saath banaaya gaya jo morcha kranti ke liye rasta saaf karata he, vahi samaajwaad kii rachana main baadhak sabit hoga
 Therefore, in one country, especially in Russia, the construction of socialism cannot be successful until the revolution takes place in other countries as well
 isliye rus kii kranti ko vishwa-kranti, khaas kar viksit deshon main kranti ke shuruaati charan ke taur par hi dekha janaa chahie
 Interestingly, there seems to be a lot of similarity between these things of Trotsky and many theories propounded by Lenin after World War I
 kuch trotskivaadiyon ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya he ki 1917 kii kranti main lenin dwaara trotski ke hi siddhanton kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 It is another matter that Trotsky himself never said this after accepting Lenin's leadership in 1917
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad stallin ne ek desh main samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii shodhpatr taiyaar kii
 Theorists like Bukharin were also with Stalin in this matter
 par trotski ne chetavanee di ki is siddhanth par amal karne ke nattejey rus ke liye vinaashkari niklenge
 He said that the time has not come for the collectivization of farming
 trotski lenin dwaara sthapit komintern ko soviet videsh niti ke aujaar main simit kar dene ke bhi viruddh the
 He argued that the Soviet Union must follow the path of industrialization and modernization, but these achievements cannot be considered synonymous with socialism
 samaajwaad kaa matlab he, shram kii unchi utpaadakta, uske parinamswaroop behatar jivan-str or apane poonjeewaad ke sarvaadhik viksit roopon jaisaa samaaj
 This can only happen when the proletariat has the reins of the world economy
 trotski kaa kahana tha ki stallin ke tahat jo soviet vyavastha he, use keval sankramanakalin samajha janaa chahie
 At present, it cannot be guaranteed that it will develop into socialism or it will degenerate into some version of capitalism
 trotski maanate the ki rus kii naukarshahi ek naye varg kii shakl leti ja rahi he
 Even though Soviet society has not reached the state of state capitalism, but its condition is like a lesser state of workers
 trotski ke vichaaron kii vishesh baat yah thi ki unamem marxvad ko har samasya kii achook aushadhi ke rup main dekhne kii pravritiyon kaa virodh nihit tha
 Similarly, he was also against pushing various fields of art-literature and knowledge in a particular direction in the name of Marxism
 apane in radical vichaaron ke baavjood ve party kaa bahumat apane paksh main nahin kar sake
 Within the party, he was seen as a leader who could provide charismatic leadership in case of a crisis, but was not interested in dealing with the everyday ups and downs within the party, and his intellectual brilliance i like to be alone
 jab trotski kii ummiido ke mutabik europe main kranti nahin hui, to unhone vishwa-kranti kaa lakshya chhod kar keval ek desh main samaajwaad kaa nirmaan karne main lag jane kii stalineey pariyojna ko iskaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 Trotsky has never believed that the leninist-bolshevik idea of party and politics is at the root of the Stalinist mistakes, which has led to a single state-run state becoming its captive society
 darasal, trotski ne jivan ke tisare daur main nishkasana bhogate hue bhi 1903 se 1914 ke bich kii gayi lenin or bolshevikwaad kii apni kathor aalochanaon ko kabhi nahin doharaaya
 Ram Manohar Lohia started the movement of English hato-hindi Lao in the sixties in independent India
 is aandolan kii gananaa ab tak ke kuch ine gine andolanon main kii ja sakati he
 Lohia believed that democracy is not possible without the lingua franca
 1957 se chhedi gayi is muhim main 1962-63 main jansangh bhi shaamil ho gaya
 But due to the demise of Lohia ji, anti-hindi movement in the south, political cravings of politicians, this movement could not succeed
 samaajawaadee raajnneeti ke purodha dow raamamanohar lohia ke bhashaa sambandhi samast chintan or andolan kaa lakshya bhartiya saarvajanik jivan se angareji ke varchasv ko hataanaa tha
 Lohia had no objection with the mere English language
 angareji ke vipul sahitya ke bhi vah virdohi nahin the, balki vichaar or shodh kii bhashaa ke rup main vah angareji kaa sammaan karte the
 Ram Manohar Lohia did the most work in the promotion of Hindi after Mahatma Gandhi
 ve sagun samaajwaad ke pakshdhar the
 He said in the Lok Sabha: 1950 main jab bhartiya samvidhan lagu hua tab usamen bhi yah vyavastha di gai thi ki 1965 tak suvidha ke hisaab se angreji kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he lekin uske baad hindi ko rajbhasha kaa darja diya jayega
 Before the constitutional deadline was met, Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia converted the English Hatao Movement into an active movement in 1957
 ve puure bharat main is andolan kaa prachaar karne lage
 The Jana Sangh also became actively involved in this movement in 1962–63
 lekin is dauraan dakshin bharat ke rajyon andolan kaa virodh hone laga
 The DMK party under the leadership of Annadurai in Tamil Nadu intensified the anti-hindi movement
 iske baad kuch shaharon main andolan kaa hinsak rup bhi dekhne ko mila
 In many places, English signboards written above the shops were broken

 The ruling rulers introduced the issue of Hindi as an imperialist language and fought the dispute between Hindi and other Indian languages, calling it a threat to national unity and integrity
 ise desh jodak bhashaa nahin, desh todak bhashaa bana diya
 Lohia denied that in the freedom movement, Hindi has worked as a language connecting the country
 desh main ekta sthapit kii he, aage bhi is bhashaa main sambhaavna he
 At the same time, he also said that if Hindi does not want to be the language of government, administration, court-court then it should be replaced by any other Indian language
 jaruri ho to hindi ko bhi shaamil kar liya jaae
 But the dominance of English should not be replaced by the mother tongue of India
 lohia jab 'angareji hataane' kii baat karte hai, to uskaa matlab 'hindi laana' nahin he
 Rather, Lohia has a special understanding behind the slogan of removing English
 lohia bhartiya janata par thopi gai angareji ke sthaan par bhartiya bhashaaon ko pratishtha dilaane ke pakshdhar the
 On 19 September 1962 in Hyderabad, Lohia said, unke liye swabhaasha raajnneeti kaa mudda nahin balki apane swabhimaan kaa prashn or lakhon–karodon ko hin granthi se ubarkar aatmavishvaas se bhar dene kaa swapn tha– During the anti-hindi agitations of the south, Lohia was agitating against English in the whole of South India and in favor of Hindi and other Indian languages
 hindi ke prati jhukaav kii vajah se durbhaagya se dakshin bharat ke kuch logon ko lohia uttar or brahman samskruti ke pratinidhi ke rup main dikhaai dete the
 In South India, the slogan of 'english Hatao' meant 'lao Hindi'
 is vajah se lohia ko dakshin bharat main sabhaayen karne main kai baar kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 During the meetings in Madras and Coimbatore in 1961, stones were thrown at him
 aisi ghatnaon ke bich haidarabad lohia or socialist party kii gatividhiyon kaa centre bana rahaa
 Many important meetings of the 'english Hatao' movement took place in Hyderabad

 Nehru amended the Constitution in 1963 and gave English along with Hindi the status of co-official language of India indefinitely

 a torch or bearing is used to handle the parts of a rotating machine
 yah ek aisi yantric yukti he jo mashin ke do yaa adhik bhaagon ke bich kam se kam gharshan ke saath saapeksh gati kii suvidha pradaan karti he
 The part of the spindle or spindle which is placed on the bearing is called a journal
 jarnal, dharuk ke bheetar gumti rahati he or is prakaar ek to dharuk dhuree kaa bhaar or duusare usapar daale hue balon ko sahan karti he tathaa dhuri ko bina kisi rukaawat ke ghoomane kaa avasar detii he
 The simple torrent is similar to a tube in which the axle is inserted
 parantu tej chalanevaali dhuriyon ke liye, yaa jahaan gharshan ke kaaran dharuk tapakar kharaab ho saktaa ho, dharuk ke do paaton main banaaya jaataa he jo vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 The torrent of a machine is the part on which the load is kept at all times when the machine is running and due to rotation of the axle, the torrent keeps weeping something
 yadi dharuk ko thik prakaar se na banaaya jaae to bahut jald usko badalanaa padataa he
 Therefore, keeping all the things in mind, the Dharuk has to be made in such a way that at least the worn and worn parts can be replaced with convenience
 dharuk ke do bhaag hote hai, ek bandhani kehalaata he, jo mashin main ksaa jaataa he or is bandhani ke bheetar dharuk ko jamaaya jaataa he, jo pital "gan" dhaatu, yaa kaanse kaa hota he
 Other similar metals are also used in making this part
 isi bhaag ke bheetar dhuree gumti he
 It has been said above that either the torrent is made in one part like a tube, or it is made in two parts in such a way that the two parts become like a tube
 dhuree dharuk ke do paaton pa1 tathaa pa2 ke bich main he
 The lower portion of the torrent is placed in a semicircular space of p 2 bandhani
 is paat ko ghoomane se rokane ke liye prakshep rakhaa jaataa he
 Putting the spindle in this vessel, the plate p 2 is applied over it and tightened by the tip of the cap
 topi t ke upree bhaag main ek chhed chha banaaya jaataa he, jisase tel yaa snehak diya jaataa he
 The oil or lubricant moves through the hole in the grooves inside the axle and when the spindle rotates, the lubricant creates a membrane between the spindle and the torrent, which causes the spindle to rotate only on this membrane of the lubricant
 isliye dharuk kaa ghisaav bahut kam hota he or vah bhi dhuree ke puri raftaar pakadaney se pehle tathaa iske rukne ke samay hi haata he
 If the lubricant is given at the right time, then the dharuk lasts for many days
 aadhunik aakalp ke dharuk duusare dhang se banaae jate hai
 In factories, where the long axles have many torches, it is taken into account by the assumption that the axle alignment can be corrected in the vertical and horizontal direction by the administrative screws
 tej or baari dhuriyon ke dharak ke neeche ke bhaag main tel yaa snehak kaa ek aagaar rahata he
 Some torches have oil-filled palms at the bottom
 ye talp dhuree or dharuk ke bich main rahete hai or talp se ek batti chhed main se hoti hui tel ke kuen main chali jaati he
 Through this light, the oil gets oil all the time
 dharuk ke bich tel bhejne kii do reetiyaan hai, gurutv se yaa dabaav se
 The location of the maximum nipid of the membrane that this oil makes when moving inside the spindle is dependent on the speed of the spindle, the load and the direction of its rotation
 yadi kshaitij dhuree par, jo vamavart disha main gum rahi he bhaar daalaa jaae to mahattam daab kaa centre bich kii khadi rekha ke dahini ore 10 degree se 45 degree tak ke kone par milegaa or yah kone bhaar tathaa gati ke maan par aadhrut hoga
 Due to low speed and high load, the center of maximum pressure will be almost at the bottom of the torrent
 nunatam daab kaa kshetrafal, is dhuree ke liye upree bhaag main khadi rekha ke dahini or hoga
 If the direction of rotation of the axis is changed, the maximum and minimum pressure points will be to the left of the center line standing at the same angle
 jin dharukon main tel aakarshan se jaataa he unke liye tel ko nunatam daab ke sthaan par bheetar janaa chahie
 If there is a load on the main bearings, the oil from the upper part of the holders also works
 jahaan dabaav se tel diya he vahaan tel ke mahattam nipid ke sthaan ke paas se bheetar bhejnaa thik hoga
 This location should be in the same direction as the axis is rotating
 chote dharukon ko chhodkar anya sab dharukon main khaanche banaae jate hai, jisase tel sab sthanon par ek samaan fail jaataa he
 These grooves are not made at the places where the oil is niped, because the grooves at these places will give the oil an opportunity to move to places of low friction and the oil membrane will not be properly formed
 mukhya bering yaa jarnal main khaanche nahin banaae jate, balki dharukon main hi banaae jate hai, parantu tel ke bheetar aane ke sthaan se dhuree ke ghoomane kii disha kii ore janevaala khaanchaa adhik laabhadaayak he
 The friction coefficient, thr, of a given torrent is dependent on the characteristics of the oil
 dharuk kii dhaatu kaa prabhaav gharshan gunank ke upar avashya hota he, yah dhuree ke chalane or tel kii jhilli banane tathaa dhuree ke rukne yaa phir snehak ke gunon par nirbhar hota he
 Suppose a fine oil membrane is formed then the coefficient of conflict is based on oil, heat, speed and load
 gharshan gunank 0
005 yaa 0
002 achche snehak ke liye or 0
05 yaa isse adhik kharaab snehak ke liye hota he
 Without oil holders are also used in places where it is necessary to ensure that the oil spills do not spoil the goods produced by the machine, such as textile making machines
 yadi in mashiinon main telvaale dharuk hon to kapade par tel jarur giregaa, jisase kapadaa kharaab ho jayega
 Hence, these torrents are of different types
 ek dharuk main tel main bhigi hui lakdi lagaai jaati he, duusare main pital ke bhaag main graphit laga diya jaataa he, jiske kaaran gharshan bahut kam ho jaataa he
 Similar and other dharuks are also made, which do not require oil
 kuch aakalpan karanevaalon kaa vichaar he ki dhuree kii shakti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jarnal kaa vyas kam se kam rakhana chahie, jiske kaaran kam se kam ghisaav ho
 It is also said that if the speed of the spindle is to be kept high then the load on it should also be less
 parantu aadhunik aakalpan karanevaalon main yah sthir kiya he ki yadi dharuk kaa aakalpan thik prakaar se kiya jaae, to gati ke saath saath isapar bhaar bhi zyada daalaa ja saktaa he
 There will be no harm from this
 yah bhi siddh kar diya he ki dharuk kii lambaai kam karne se adhik laabh hota he, visheshkar zyada gati kii dhuree ke liye yah bahut jaruri he
 Less long torrents will not tilt
 iske kaaran dharuk ke bheetar nipid har sthaan par baraabar hoga
 Therefore, by keeping the length of the blade less than its diameter, the speed of the axle can also be increased and the load on the axis can also be increased
 iskaa dhyaan rahe ki yadi dharukon kii lambaai adhik kam ho gai to iske bheetar kaa nipid bad jayega, jiske kaaran dhuree main jakad paidaa ho sakati he or agar lambaai adhik ho gai to dharuk main jhukaav paidaa ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the ratio of length and diameter of the blade should be kept in such a way that neither there is fear of bending nor can it be curved
 isi kaaran yah anupaat pani ke jahaaj kii dhuree ke liye 1 : 1
5, sthapit injanon ke liye 1
2 : 2
5, saral baari dhuree ke liye 2 : 3 or 3 : 4 rakhaa jaataa he
 There are many types of Dharuk
 inamen har ek kaa upyog alag alag he : Rivet Dharuk is made for the vertical axis
 isamen "va" ek bandhani he, jisko mashin main ksaa jaataa he
 This bandhani has a brass torch, in which the axles are attached
 dhuree kaa puraa bhaar dharuk ke aadhaar par rahata he
 It is made semicircular and in this part there is oil or lubricant
 ek pariksha ke fal se yah pataa chalaa he ki yadi is dharuk ke aadhaar main ek khaanchaa banaakar usamen tel bhar diya jaae to dhuree ke chalane par yah tel upar kii ore jaataa he or dhuree ke baraabar se hota hua baahar nikal jaataa he
 If this exhaled oil is sent back in, then this oil can be used again and again and there will never be any oil inside the torrent
 is prakaar kii dhuree par bhaar adhik hone se kilak par adhik daab ho jaaegi, jiske kaaran dharuk vifal ho saktaa he
 Therefore, no more than 15 kg per square centimeter of pressure is applied on this type of torrent
 isse adhik daab hone par galpatt dharuk kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This type of holders are used in places where there is more load on the axle
 is dharuk kaa pital do bhaagon main hota he, jinamein dhuree ke padon ke anusaar khaanche bane hote hai
 In these grooves the positions of the spindle are seated and this joint is removed in the limb ligament
 is prakaar har ek pad alag alag kaam karata he or dhuree kaa bhaar in padon main bant jaataa he
 These holders are kept cool by water
 yadi yah dharuk thik prakaar thande rakhe jaaen or inamen thik samay par tel bhi diya jaataa rahe to yah adhik chaal or daab sahan kar sakate hai or adhik dinon tak chal sakate hai
 In the torrents described so far, the axis of the spindle rotates at the bottom of the torch and due to the serpentine friction, the metals of both are weakened
 isi gharshan ko kam karne ke liye ghoomanevaale talon ke bich belan yaa goliyon ko baitha diya jaataa he
 Thus, both the floors rotate on the cylinders and the cylinder friction works in place of the serpentine friction, due to which the heating and wear is greatly reduced, but when these holders are worn, they cannot be arranged like other holders, but rather They have to change
 ye dharuk bahut majboot hote hai or kam gharshan ke kaaran inase adhik gati bhi praapt hoti he
 Goli Gharuk is also made like this
 isaki goliyaan donon baajuon ke bich rahati hai
 The only difference is that in Goli Dharuk the load is on the points and the cylinder is on the weight lines in Dharuk
 isliye bhaar itnaa adhik nahin hona chahie ki baajuon par khaanche yaa gadhe pad jaaen
 The cylinder and pellet and arm are all made of hardened steel
 ek dharuk ke samast belanon athwa goliyon kaa pariman ek samaan hona aavashyak he nahin to bade pariman kii goli par adhik bhaar hoga or dharuk vifal ho jayega
 From the above mentioned things, it will be known that oil is an essential thing for a Dharuk to function properly
 jarnal or dharuk ke bich yah tel halaki jhilli bana letaa he, jiske kaaran donon dhaatuen ek duusare se nahin mil paatin or jarnal isi jhilli par ghumta rahata he
 If for some reason the oil in the Dharuk gets reduced, then it breaks the oil membrane and the metal of the journal starts to rub with the metal of the Dharuk, which causes the Dharuk and the journal to overheat
 is taapan se donon dhaatuen fail jaati hai or dharuk jarnal ko jakad letaa he
 The journal of the machine is the part which costs more than the torrent and protects it from spoilage
 isi ko bachaane ke liye dharuk ke pital main khaanche banaakar unamem shwet dhaatu bhar di jaati he
 When, for some reason, the torch begins to heat up, then the metal melts and runs between the journal and the torrent and the entire axis stops
 isliye jarnal ke bina kam ushma or gharshan se ghoomane ke liye do baton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he : If there is friction in the torrent, then some of the power of the shaft is lost in the torrent and the amount of useful work is reduced somewhat

 The rules of cricket in the main format apply
 lekin, ek divasiy antarrashtriya match main prayek team keval simit sankhya ke overon ke liye ballebaaji karti he
 In the early days of ODI cricket, the number of overs per team was usually 60, but now it has been uniformly limited to 50 overs
 saadhaaran bhashaa main khel is prakaar he: In the event of a decrease in the number of overs, for example due to inclement weather, the number of overs may be reduced
 yadi kisi kaaran se duusari pari main ballebaaji karne vaali vaali team dwaara khele jane vaale overon kii sankhya pehali pari main ballebaaji karne vaali team se alag ho to dakworth-louis vidhi dwaara parinaam nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he

 Traditionally, the fielding ban was applied for the first 15 overs of each innings
 30 july 2005 se shuru hone vaali 10 maah kii pareekshan avadhi main isisi ne ekadivasiy shrinkhalaaon ke nae niyamon ke rup main powerple niyam kii shuruyaat kii
 Under the Powerplay rule, the fielding ban applies for the first 10 overs and in two parts of five overs
 oktober 2008 se ballebaaji karne vaali team yah faisla karti he ki shesh bache hue do hisson main koi ek powerple kab shuru ho, tathaa kshetrarakshan karne vaali team yah nirdhaarit karti he ki doosraa powerple kab shuru ho
 During the first powerplay, no more than two players can be parked outside the radius of 30 yards
 It is also necessary in the first 10 overs that at least two fielders are in close positions to catch catches
 powerple ke sambandh main isisi ne yah ghoshnaa kii he ki 1 oktober 2007 se kshetrarakshan karne vaali team kaa captain paanch-paanch overon ke do powerple ke dauraan 3 khilaadiyon ko 30 gaj ke daayre ke baahar rakhane kaa vikalp chun saktaa he
 This rule was implemented in the match played between Sri Lanka and England at Dambulla Stadium on 1 October 2007
 srilanka 119 ranon se yah match jeeta
 Currently during the second and third powerplays, 3 players stand outside the 30-yard radius and are selected by a powerplay batting team
 pareekshan niyamon main ek pratisthaapan niyam bhi tha, jiske anusaar match kii kisi bhi sthiti main ek sthanapann khilaadi ko shaamil karne kii anumati thi
 Prior to the toss, the teams nominated their replacement player, known as the Supersub
 supersab ballebaaji, gendbaazim kshetrarakshan yaa wicket keeping kar saktaa tha; pratisthapit khilaadi khel main aage bhaag nahin le saktaa tha
 In the six months since it was implemented, it became largely clear that the supersub was more beneficial to the team that won the toss, creating an imbalance in the game
 2005 main is niyam ko khatm karne ke liye kai antarrashtriya captainon ne "jentalman samjhauta" kiya
 They continued to nominate Supersub as required, but were not fielded

 ibne saood dorahٔ misr ke avasar par shah faruq ke sathanjad kaa saudi parivaar unnisvin sadi ke shuru main dweep namaae arab ke bahut bade hisse par kabiz ho gaya tha lekin misri shaasha mohammad ali pasha ne aal saood in sarkaar ko 1818 i
 main samaapt kar diya tha
 The Saudi family continued to be troubled for almost 80 years thereafter, even in the early 20th century another strong man was born in this family named Abdul Aziz Ibne Saud who is commonly known as Sultan Ibne Saud
 ibne saood unnisvin sadi ke ant main apane pita ke saath arab ke ek tateey shahar kuwait main jala ni jivan guzaar rahe the
 He was a very brave man and lived in tune to somehow start a lost government of his climate

 After that he also won the rest of Najd
 1913 i
 main ibne saood ne khadi faras ke tateey praant lahsaay par jo osman turkon dwaara prabhaav tha, kabja kar liya
 After this, World War i broke out in Europe, during which Ibne Saud established friendly relations with Britain but did not take any action against the Turks
 yuddh ke ant ke baad sharif hossain ne khalipha banane kii ghoshnaa kar di to ibne saood ne hajaaz par bharpoor hamalة kar diya or chaar maheene ke bheetar puure hajaaz par kabja kar liya or 8 janvari 1926 i

 The first country that accepted Ibne Saud's kingship was Russia
 rus ne 11 farvari 1926 i
 ko hajaaz or najad par saudi sarkaar ko sweekaar kiya lekin britain ne der se kaam liya or anubandh jada ke baad sweekaar kiya
 Thus, one hundred years after its fall, the Saudi kingdom once again emerged with full force and became the greatest power of Arabia
 moothmar islamic After occupying the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, Ibne Saud did not seek to become a caliph but to manage the Hajjas and solve modern-day problems, he included Muslim leaders from all over the world between 13 and 19 May 1926
 Muttamar Islami Maangi in which thirteen Islamic countries participated
 moothmar main islamic hind ke ek pratinidhimandal ne bhi bhaag liya, jiskaa sabase pramukh vyakti moulana mohammad ali johar the
 Although this mootamar could not succeed in its objective but the alliance is a milestone in the movement of Islam

 Tanazih 8 Yemen 1930 main ibne saood ne seer or najran ke sthanon ko saudi rajya main shaamil kiya
 Since both these areas were located on the border of Yemen and they also claimed Yemen, Saudi Arabia had an encounter with Yemen
 saudi arab kii sena ne jo yaman kii senaaon kii tulana main adhik sangathit or dharmik bhaavana se samarpit thim, yaman ko haraaya or 1934 i

 Earlier, the Saudi army also tried to include Jordan in its power, but due to pressure from the British, they could not succeed in their objective
 Had Ibne Saud succeeded in the Jordan and Yemen expedition, the entire island would have come under Namay Arab but at that time the Ibne Saud government was the largest Arab government in Asia by area and the whole island except Yemen, Oman and some coastal areas Saudi Balahasti was established on Namay Arab

 Ibne Saud could not abolish the emperor, but he used to do all the work in consultation with a parliament of scholars and he tried his best to implement the Islamic rule in the country
 He stopped buying and selling liquor in the whole country which had become prevalent in Hajaz etc
 during the Turks
 ibne saood jab tak jivit rahe anya saamaajik buraaiyon ko bhi failane kaa mauka na diya
 Established a Fiqh College on the lines of Jamia Jazhar in 1948 for the development of Dini Talim

 Another act of Ibne Saud is the establishment of peace and peace in the country
 Even historians have written that only two men in history succeeded in establishing the right peace of life in one Arab, one Hazrat Omar Raziallahu and the other Ibne Saudus opposite Hazrat Ali In Ibne Abi Talib Raziallahu 35 Hijri, Muslims presented the post of Khilafat to Islam in front of Hazrat Ali Alaihissalam

 The throne was abdicated in 1924 AD after defeating Najad's commander Abdul Aziz Ibne Saud
 1924 i
 se 1931 tak cyprus main nirvasit he
 But All Saud was not a successful king, so All Saud proved to be a successful king - since most of the Arab region is made up of desert and barren mountainous areas, so the sources of income are less, so Sultan Ibne Saud could not give more development to the country in economic and educational terms
 In his Akhir reign, leaking kerosene wells came out in Arabia, this time the country's body was overturned and the government started earning crores of rupees annually

 gunasutra yaa chromosome sabhi vanaspatiyon va praaniyon kii koshikaon main paye jane vaale tantu rupi pind hote hai, jo ki sabhi anuvaanshik gunon ko nirdhaarit va sanchaarit karte hai
 The number of chromosomes in each species remains fixed
 maanav koshika main gunasutron kii sankhya 46 hoti he jo 23 ke jode main hote he
 Of these, 22 chromosomes are identical in male and female and homologous to their pairs
 inhen sammilit rup se samajaat gunasutra kehete he
 The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are not the same between men and women, which are called heterogeneous chromosomes
 gunasutra kii sanrachana main do padaarth visheshat: sanmilit rahete hai- DNA is the only genetic material
 di e na e anu kii sanrachana main chaar carbonic samaakshar sammilit hote hai : do purine, do pirimidine, ek chini-dioxyribose or phosforic amla 
 Purine contains adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine has thymine and cytosine
 di en e ke ek anu main do sutara hote hai, jo ek duusare ke chaaron or sarpil rup main valayit hote he
 Each DNA formula consists of one or more of the four organic cells in this sequence - thymine, cytosine, adenine, and guanine, and they are interconnected in a particular way
 in chaar samaakshaaron or unase sambandhit sharkara or phophoric amla anu kaa ek ekak tetraneucliotid hota he or kai sahastra tetraneucliotidon kaa ek di en e anu banataa he
 The reason for the variation of DNA of different beings is the difference in the sequence of cells
 di en e or aisa hi ek doosraa newcliik amla aar en e carbonic samaakshar kii upasthiti ke kaaran parabangnee ko adhikansh 2,600 angstrom ke kshetra main antarleen karte hai
 On this basis, a quantitative quantitative arrival of DNA is made
 praaniyon main do vishesh prakaar ke centresutra paae jate hai
 One is found in some dipterra insecta in the nuclei of the ovarian ligaments
 ye gunasutra usee jati ke saadhaaran gunasutron kii apeksha kai sau gune lambey or chaude hote hai
 For this reason, they are called Mahagunasutra
 inaki sanrachana saadhaaran samasutran or ardhasuthran centresutron se kuch bhinn dikhaai padati he
 Here, instead of one chromosome, a transverse line consists of granules that have more ability to stain
 gunasutra ke ek chor se duusare tak bahut si aisi anuprastha pankti kii sab kanikas ek samaan hoti hai or anya panktiyon kii kanikaon main visheshtaayen or vibhinnataayen hoti he
 As these chromosomes are very long, it is believed that they are completely desensitized and perhaps there is some elongation of the protein
 adhik chaude hone ke kaaran yah he ki ek gunasutra apane samaan ek duusare cendrak-tra kaa sanshleshan karata he
 At the time of samasutraana in ordinary state, these two sutras separate from each other, but in the Mahagunasutra it does not
 donon sutara ek duusare se jude hi rah jate hai
 The number of the Mahagunasutra is half that of the ordinary chromosome, as each sutra is paired with another sutra like it
 is ghatana ko daihik yugman kehete hai
 Another odd chromosome is also found in animals
 isak lampbrush gunasutra kehete hai
 These chromosomes are found in the nuclei of the eggs of animals that have high amounts of eggs, such as fish, amphibians, eggs, birds etc
 gunasutra saadhaaran diplotine-dyakinisis gunasutron ke samaan do do yugmit sutron ke bane hote hai
 Both paired sutras are connected to each other in some places and are far away from each other in other places
 in jodon ko kiesma samajha jaataa he
 On each sutra, which is called chromonima, there are granules of different lamination in place, which are called chromimiers
 prayek chromomier se ek jodi yaa adhik parshvapash jude hue hote he
 The lateral side is also made of a formula similar to chromonema, but the ribonucleo-protein corpuscles are gathered around it, making these formulas appear thick
 chromomier bhi chromonima se santat hote hai
 The nuclei are produced on a particular chromosome
 adhikansh jantuon kii prayek koshika main gunasutron ke do ekatm kulak hote hai
 a clan remains in the mature larynx
 aise praani or koshikaaye dwiganit kahi jaati hai, parantu kuch praaniyon, visheshat: paudhon, main do se adhik kulak gunasutron ke hote hai yah bahugunit kahe jate hai
 If the centrosome of a diploid animal is doubled, so that each of the sutras in its cells is like four, then such a creature is called an autopolyploid
 yadi kisi dwiguneet sankar ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to aise praani ko allopoliploid kehete hai
 If a diploid animal, whose centrosomes are K1a1b1b1c1c1, etc
, is hybridized to another animal, whose chromosomes are K2a2b2b2c2c2, etc
, then its offspring will have chromosome A1a2b1b2c1c2 etc
 k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ityadi ek duusare se bhinn honge or inamen saadhaarant: yugman nahin hoga
 If the chromosomes of this creature are doubled, then in their cells A1a1a2a2; b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2; C1 c1 c2 c2, etc
 will have chromosomes
 yah allopoliploid kaha jayega
 Polyploids may also have more than four kulaks
 yah spasht he ki autopoliploid main zaigotin avasthaa main chatu:sanyojak utpann ho jaayange, kyonki prayek prakaar ke chaar chaar gunasutra upasthit hai or chaar sutron ke yugman se ek chatu:sanyojak banataa he
 At the time of cell division each pole will not get equal number of chromosomes
 praaia: aisa hota he ki ek chatu:sanyojak ke tuutane se kisi dhruv par teen sutara pahunche or uske sanmukh dhruv par ek hi sutara pahunche
 The offspring cells formed at the end of cell division will either have more chromosomes or fewer, and such imbalance results in the cell's death
 isi kaaran autotetraploid bahut kam urvar hote hai
 Autotetraploid plants are much larger than ordinary diploid plants and their seeds are also very large, so that they can prove more beneficial for the householder even when fertility is low
 thandhak pahunchaakar, yaa kuch alkelidon ke prabhaav se, paudhe atopoliplide banaae ja sakate hai
 The conditions are opposite in allotetraploids
 yadi donon aadim matapita ke sutara ek duusare se purna rup se vibhinn hon to allopoliplide kriyaatmak rup se dwiguneet he or purna rup se urvar hoga
 For example, if the formulas in a hybrid are completely different from those of K1a2, B1b2, C1c2, then such a hybrid will be sterile, but this state will be changed by doubling its chromosomes
 aisi koshikaon main k1 k1 k2 k2, kha1 kha1 kha2 kha2, ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2 ityadi sutara honge or jin shakhaon main aisi koshikaaye hongi unpar phool lagenge, kyonki aisi koshikaon main miotic vibhaajan safal hoga, k1 k1 se yugmit hoga, kha1 kha1 se ityadi
 The dhatura stramonium has 12 pairs of chromosomes in the diploid state and becomes bivalent at the time of meiosis
 iske autopoliploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra hote he or ardhasuthran ke samay 12 chatu:sanyojak banate hai
 Similarly, the plant diploid from Primula sinensis has 12 pairs of chromosomes and the autotetraploid has 48 formulas and at the time of meiosis it has 9 to 11 quadruple connectives and 2 to 6 are divalent
 solemon likopersicon ke dwiguneet main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or uske autotetraploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra
 These are all plants
 kripis rubra aura kripis foetida main 5 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 Their formulas do not differ much from each other and in hybrids resulting from their hybridization, 5 bisects are formed at the time of meiosis
 iske allopoliploid main 20 ken drakasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran main 0 se 5 chatu:sanyojak banate hai or 0 se 10 dwisanyojak
 It is clear that allotetraploids will not be very fertile
 primmula floribanda or primmula resticileta donon main hi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare ke praaia: samaan hote hai
 The hybrids that they make from their hybridization are known as primateza kivensis
 isamen bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 At the time of meiosis, the coupling is successful and 9 bisectors are formed
 sutron ke dvigun hone se jo allopoliplide banataa he usamen 9 chatushk sutara hote hai or aise paudhe main 12 se 18 tak dwisanyojak banate hai or 0 se 3 tak chatu:sanyojak
 It is clear that the number of quadrilateral is very small and sometimes not a single quadrant is formed
 muuli or karamkalla main se prayek main 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 The hybrid Raphanus brassicae resulting from their hybridization also has 9 pair of chromosomes; But in meiosis, a single bisector is not formed, because the coupling action is not successful and all the formulas remain unpaired, making 12 unicellular
 iske sutara dvigun se utpann elotetraploid main 12 jodi sutara hote hai or ardhasuthran main 12 sanyojak banate hai, chatu:sanyojak ek bhi nahin
 The result is that raphanus-brassica-allatetraploid is very fertile, although raphanus-brassica-diploid is sterile
 jantuon main poliploidi bahut kam pai jaati he par yah anishekajanit jantuon main bahudhaa pai jaati he
 Many new species in plants may have arisen due to polyploidy
 iskaa pramaan isse miltaa he ki angiousparmon kii lagbhag aadhi jatiyaan aisi he jinke paripakv yugmakon ke gunasutron kii sankhya kisi sambandhit jati ke yugmakeey gunasutra kii sankhya kii guneet he
 There are many varieties of wheat
 in jatiyon kii mul yugmakeey cendraksutra sankhya 7 he
 The number of chromosomes is found to be 14, 21,42 and 49 multiplied by 7 among the wheat species
 isi bhanti tambaakoo kii bhinn bhinn jatiyon main gunasutron kii sankhya 12 athwa 12 kii guneet 24 hoti he
 Many polyploids have been formed by use in plants, which have two clusters of unitary formulas

 There is no doubt that cytoplasm functions under the control of the nucleus

 Space vector modulation) is an algorithm for pulse with modulation
 iskaa upyog prayavarti dhara banane main hota he jo mukhyatah teen feji motaron ko parivarti chaal se ghumaane ke kaam aata he
 Space vector modulation can be done in many ways and these different types of space vector modulation have different properties
 paashv chitra main dikhaaye gayi inwarter ke swichon ko band-chaalu karne ke kuch moolbhoot niyam hai
 For example, at any point of time both switches in one column should not be turned on if we assume that both switches of the same column will be in mutually complementary state, ie when a + is turned on then A− is closed and when a - Will turn on when a + is off
