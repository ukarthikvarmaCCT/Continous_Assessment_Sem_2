 In some recent movements, it has also been proposed to call this incident in the name of Jungle Mahal Freedom Movement instead of Chuad Rebellion
 chuad athwa chuhaad kaa shabdic arth luteraa athwa utpaati hota he
 When the first collection of goods was started in 1765 AD by the East India Company in the Junglemahal district of Chotanagpur, Bengal, then the British, in this scandalous manner, the activities of water, forest, land grab by the Kudmi community in 1769 AD The first opposition under the leadership of Raghunath Mahato was carried out and the bugle of revolution was blown against the British rulers

 After the victory of the Buxar War in 1764, the morale of the British increased

 On August 12, 1765, the British got the Diwali of Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Chotanagpur from Shah Alam II
 uske baad angarejon ne kisaanon se lagaan vasuulana shuru kar diya
 In 1766, the British pressurized the landlords for revenue, but the landlords did not accept their subordination
 nateeja yah hua ki kisaan angareji julm ke shikaar hone lage
 The situation began to become uncontrolled, then there was a situation of agitation
 angarejon ne chuad kii jameen chin kar jameendaaron ke haathon bechnaa shuru kar diya
 They started being tortured physically

 Thus there was dissatisfaction among the local Chuad people over their natural rights to land and when they rebelled, they also got the leadership of the landlords who were evicted

 From here they started gorilla attacks

 saamaajik vipanan Social marketing considers the consumers' wants of a company, the needs of the company, and the long-term interests of society
 saamaajik vipanan avadharana, sanghathan ke kaary jaruraton kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye hai
 One of the goals is to uphold the interests of the market or to enhance the well-being of the consumer and that of society in a way that will be more effectively and efficiently than competitors to deliver the desired satisfaction
 isliye, bazaar kii jaruraton ko santusht karne kaa prayaas he or ek puure ke rup main upabhoktaaon or samaaj kii bhalaai ke sangrakshan or badhaane ke tareekon main he ki apane lakshya bazaar ke liye karnaa chahie
 This proximity is linked with the principles of corporate social responsibility and for sustainable development
 uddeshy 1 "social responsibility is also a business decision maker 


 implies that the task that is to be taken to protect and to enhance the interests of society
 2 "vyapaar main madad karne ke liye jimmedaari he xxrep 4 
 yah uchit khapat mulyon ko badhaava dene ke liye vyapaar kaa kartavya he
 3 "business leaders are mandating to take a leadership role in the advancement of our society to a new level of ethical conduct
 itihaas The concept of social marketing emerged in 1972 since then to promote a more socially responsible moral and ethical model of marketing, to counter the consumerism way of thinking
 yah harvard bijness rivyuu jarnal main "bazaar ke liye kya matlab he upabhoktavaad" philip kotler ne ek lekh main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Social and social concerns existed until then, but it was not that they became explicitly included in the marketing literature
 kotlar vipanan avadharana or iske praudyogikiyon ke liye ek adhik spasht saamaajik unmukhikaran apanaakar swabhaav or antat sanshodhit kiya janaa hi unka tark tha, or saamaajik vipanan saamaajik vipanan kii us avadhi avadharana donon main pesh kiya
 Kotler's novelty to the marketing concept was the idea of "long-run consumer welfare", emphasizing that short-term desires could not support the long-term interests of the consumer or good for society as a whole
 saamaajik vipanan or saamaajik vipanan Social marketing should not be confused with social marketing
 saamaajik vipanan avadharana vanijyik vipanan ranneetiyon main saamaajik jimmedaari ke muddon ko ekikrut karne main satat vipanan ke ek agradoot the
 In contrast, social marketing uses commercial marketing principles, tools and techniques for social issues
 saamaajik vipanan ek "kendrit graahak" drushtikon lagu hota he or virdohi dhumrapaan-abhiyaan yaa gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke liye kosh jutaney jaise saamaajik lakshyon kii khoj main vanijyik vipanak dwaara istemaal avadharanaon or upkarnon kaa upyog karata he
 We social marketing can be defined as "marketing with a social dimension or marketing that includes non-economic criteria" as stated above
 saamaajik vipanan "samaaj ke dirghakaalik hiton ke liye chintaa"
 It is about "direct benefit to the organization and secondary benefit to the community"
 yah tatkaal upabhokta kii santushti or lambii avadhi ke upabhokta laabh ke bich ek fark padataa he
 Accordingly, Andreas Kaplan defines social management as "management that takes into account the overall welfare of society in addition to the mere profitability idea
" "saamaajik vipanan kotlar or zaltman ke saath, 1971 main shuru hua ki ek anushaasan he
 It is defined as an "adaptation of commercial marketing techniques to programs designed to affect the voluntary behavior of the target audience to improve their personal well-being of society and of which they are a part" 
 saamaajik vipanan adhik se adhik saamaajik bhalaai ke liye lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye, or adhik paramparaagat vyavsaayik takanic or ranneeti, bikri par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Not for profit campaigns for their organizations as for example fund raising, qualification goods being encouraged or non smoking campaigns as well as promoting the society discourages the use of demerit goods or Seat belts can promote the use of either
 saamaajik vipanan kii ek or visheshta he, ki unki bhalaai main sudhaar karne ke liye vyaktiyon ke vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne kii yojana banaai he
 It seems that sponsorship or online marketing is also included and usually planned or implemented by governmental and non-governmental organizations, including "more than just advertising in print media, radio or TV"
 saamaajik vipanan se saamaajik bhinnta ki ek spasht udhaaharan he gaiyr dhumrapaan par ek vipanan abhiyaan he
 a focused smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the same campaign can be an example of social marketing, the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well being of society
 saamaajik vipanan main branding One who is striving throughout the time for the betterment of corporations
 ve ke nirmaan main madad or unke brands chhaviyon kii marammat karne ke liye korporate saamaajik vipanan kaarykram ke roopon ke sabhi prakaar ke liye badal rahe hai
 Corporate social marketing, or CSM, typically refers to marketing efforts that have at least one social-related purpose, such as the founder of a charity, among its goals
 vishisht udhaaharan utpaada se sambandhit ek charity ke liye antim bikri utpaada kaa ek nishchit pratishat reeha, yaa is tarah ke olympic khelon ke rup main acchhee tarah se kiya ja rahaa saamaajik protsaahit karte hai ki ghatnaon ko pryojit kar rahe hai
 Corporate social marketing benefits a company in many ways, but its main goals are to improve the public company's image
 jivan ko yaa dusron ko, paryaavaran yaa anya yogya kaarnon main sudhaar karne ke liye patibaddh lagata he ki ek company nahin he jo ek se ek behatar prakaash main dekha jaataa he, or adhik se adhik vyapaar ki se laabh hone kii ummid kar rahe hai
 Therefore, it may be because CSM programs are becoming extremely popular that leaders believe that it should be seen as a socially responsible company, a good business
 bhale hi haalanki, pichley anusandhan siesam brands equity main sudhaar or bazaar main hissedari badhaane main kargar ho saktaa he, in prayaason kii prabhaavashiltaa ke liye koi seemaa nahin he
 An example of that is how corporate is perceived to adversely affect social purchase intentions if the consumer initiative is to be sacrificed in order for the company to be socially responsible
 siesam kaarykram kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he, nigam kii manshaa ke upabhoktaaon ke liye ke rup main spasht nahin ho saktaa
 This benefits if the corporation is not clear or conflicts with what consumers already believe about a specific firm or industry

 shabd "gout " kaa prayog sarvapratham randolfus of bowking ke dwaara lagbhag 1200 isvin main kiya gaya tha

 The Greek physician Hippocrates, commenting on this in his aphorisms in about 400 BCE, described it as a disease not appearing in eunuchs and pre-menopausal women

 Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra
 These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed 


 some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and venery

 The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health
 About two o'clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep
 The pain is like that of a dislocation, and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them
 Then follows chills and shivers, and a little fever 


 The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected, and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint, and being worse as the fit comes on

 Acid is a chemical compound which dissolves in water to give hydrogen ions
 iskaa ph maan 7
0 se kam hota he
 According to the modern definition given by Johannes Nicholas Bronstedt and Martin Laurie, acid is the chemical compound that provides hydrogen ions to the repulsive compound
 jaise- asitic amla or salphurik amla 
 amla, thos, drav yaa gas, kisi bhi bhautik avasthaa main paae ja sakate hai
 They can live in pure form or in slurry form
 jis padaarth yaa yogic main amla ke gun paae jate hai ve kehalaate hai
 Acidity or acidity is a disease caused by excess of hydrochloric acid in the human bowel
 amla un padaarthon ko kehete hai jo pani main ghulne par khattey swaad ke hote hai, haldi se bani roli ko pilaa kar dete hai,tathaa inkaa jaleey vilyan nile litmus paper ko laal karata he
 Most metals react with hydrogen to produce gas, and neutralize the base
 mote hisaab se ksharak un padaarthon ko kehete hai jinka vilyan chikna-chikna sa lagata he, swaad kadva hota he, haldi ko laal kar dete hai or amlon ko udasin karte hai
 To neutralize means to make a substance which has neither the properties of acid nor of base
 lavaazie ne oxygen ke gunon kaa adhyayan karte samay dekha ki carbon, gandhak or phosphorus sadrush tatv jab oxygen main jalte hai tab unase bane oxide jal ke saath milakar amla banaate hai
 They reached the result that there is oxygen in acids and oxygen is the cause of acidic acid
 isi kaaran is gas kaa naam "oxygen" padaa, jiskaa arth hota he "amla banaanevaala padaarth" tathaa isi kaaran german bhashaa main oxygen ko "sir staf" arthath amla padaarth kehete hai
 Lavaziye divided acids into two classes, inorganic acids and organic acids
 peeche dekha gaya ki kuch tatwon ke oxide pani main ghulkar amla nahin balki kshar banaate hai or kuch amlon main oxygen bilkul nahin hota
 Bertile invented hydrocyanic acid in 1787, Davy invented hydrochloric acid in 1810–11 and hydriodic acid in 1813
 inamen se kisi main oxygen nahin he
 It has been observed later that the substances which are completely dry do not have any acidic reaction
 tab logon ne amlon ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya, ek hydro-amla or doosraa oxy-amla
 Back in 1815, Dewey suggested that the acidicity of acids is not due to oxygen, but due to hydrogen
 duulang ne san 1815 main oxylik amla kaa adhyayan kiya or is parinaam par pahunche ki oxynwaale or bina oxynwaale amlon main koi bhed nahin he
 Acids do not have any properties that we can call specific characteristics of acids
 saadhaaran gun upar bataae ja chuke hai
 In acid and metal reactions, one, or more, hydrogen atoms of an acid molecule are displaced by metals, metal oxides, hydroxides or carbonates
 aise bhi kuch amla hai jo khattey hone ke badale mithe hote hai
 One such acid is amido-phosphoric acid
 kuch aise bhi amla hai jo ksharhar nahin hote
 There are also some alkalis whose hydrogen is displaced by metals
 fitkaree amla nahin he
 There is also no hydrogen to be displaced

 Methane is not an acid, but its hydrogen is displaced by zinc and thus zinc is dimethyl which is not a salt

 If we want to define acids on the basis of ion theory, then we can say that hydrogen ions are essential in acids
 silavian ne san 1659 main pehle pahal amlon or ksharakon main vibhed kiya tha
 In 1774, Rul gave the name base, which combines with acids to form salts
 aajkal ksharak un oxygen vaale padaarthon ko kehete hai jo amlon ke poorak hote hai
 Alkali metals, alkali metals and other metal oxides and all those things are alkalis which combine with acids to form salts
 aarambh main ksharak keval un dhaatuon athwa dhaatuon ke oxidon ke liye vyavahrat hota tha jo lavenon ke "base" yaa aadhaar the
 The bases of salts are essential components
 ksharak vastav main ve padaarth hai jo amla ke saath milakar lavan or jal banaate hai
 For example, zinc oxide combines with sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and water
 daahak soda salfurik amla ke saath milakar sodium sulphate or jal banaata he
 Oxides of metals are generally base
 par iske apwaad bhi hai
 The bases contain metal oxides and hydroxides, but for convenience some groups of elements are also formed which combine with acids to form salts without water
 aise ksharakon main ammonia, hydraxylemin or phosphin hai
 Fluid dissolves ammonia but gives no color with phenolphthalein
 at: kahan tak yah ksharak kaha ja saktaa he, yah baat sandigdh he
 Although the definition of the base above is very unsatisfactory, it has not given a good definition
 ksharak or kshar paryaayavachi jaabd nahin hai
 All bases are bases but not all bases are bases
 kshar-dhaatuon ke oxide, jaise sodium oxide, jal main ghulkar hydraksaide banaate hai
 They are strongly basic
 kshareey mrudadhatuon ke oxide, jaise kellisyam oxide, jal main alp viley or alp kshareey hote hai
 Oxides of other metals do not dissolve in water and their hydroxides are made indirectly
 dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide ksharak hote hai
 Alkali metal oxides dissolve quickly in water
 kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main kam viley hote hai or kuch dhaatuon ke oxide jal main tanik bhi viley nahin hai
 Some nonmetal hydrides, such as hydrides of nitrogen and phosphorus are also consumed

 The account of Arthur's story is primarily composed of folklore and literary inventions, and there are controversies and differences among modern historians regarding their historical existence
 arthur kii viral aitihaasik prishthbhumi vibhinn sroton se batori gayi he, jisamen annales cambriye, historia britonam or gildas kaa lekhan bhi shaamil he

 Although in some Welsh and Breton stories and poems prior to this work, Arthur was a great warrior or magical figure of folklore, defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies, many times he appeared to be associated with another world of Welsh, a country of fairies
 is
 jeffri historia kaa kitna ansh pehle ke sroton se apanaaya gaya he or kitna jeffri ne khud avishkaar kiya he, yah agyaat he
 Although the text of the themes, events, and characters of the Arthurian legend differ widely, and there is no single authentic version, Geoffrey's version of events often contains early points of later stories
 jeffri ne varnan kiya he ki arthur britain ke raja the jinhone saxons ko haraaya tha or britain, ireland, island, norway or galle main ek samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 In fact, many elements and events are an integral part of the Arthurian story in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the magician Merlin, the famous sword, Arthur's birth in Tintagel, his decisive war against Mordred in Kamlan, and his in Avalon The last day is included

 raja arthur kii dantakatha kii aitihaasikta ke aadhaar ko lekar vidwaanon dwaara lambe samay se bahes hoti rahi he
 Those who hold a view, citing Historia Britannum and Annals Cambie, consider Arthur a genuine historical figure, a romano-british leader who fought against the invading anglo-saxons sometime in the late 5th or early 6th century
 did
 historia britainum 9veen shatabdi main mili latin aitihaasik pandulipiyon main baad main paaya gaya ek sankalan he, jo ek welsh maulavee nennius ke yahaan mila jisamen baarah ladaaiyon kii suchi he jo arthur ne ladi thim
 These ended with Mons Badonicus War or Mount Baden where he is said to have killed 960 people alone
 However, recent studies have raised questions about the historia Britannum's credibility as a source of history for the period
 anya paath 10 veen sadi kaa annals kambriye he, jisamen arthur ke aitihaasik astitv ke maamle kaa samarthan kiya gaya he, jisamen mount bedan kii ladaai kii kadi arthur se bhi judi he
 The battle date in the Annals is 516–518 and also mentions the Camlan battle in which both Arthur and Medrut were killed, the battle dates being 537–539
 in vivaranon ko aksar historia ' vrittant mana jaataa he or is baat kii pushti kii jaati he ki arthur ne vastav main mount bedan ke saath yuddh kiya tha
 However, by identifying the problems, this source is supported by the account of Historia Britannum
 naveenatam shodh se pataa chalaa he ki annals kambriye ek itivrutt ke aadhaar par 8 veen sadi ke ant main velsshuru hua tha
 In addition, the complex text of Annals Cambriae's history has no definite impediment to the fact that Arthurian history has been added to it earlier
 is baat kii adhik sambhaavna he ki 10 veen sadi main kuch bindu par joda gaya he or ve annals ke kisi purvavarti set main astitv main nahin the
 "mount Baden's entry is probably derived from Historia Britannum
 is kshetra main vishwast karne vaale aarmabhik sabooton ke abhaav main haal ke kai itihaaskaaron ne arthur ke uttar roman britain vaale vivaran ko nikaal diya he
 In the view of the historian Thomas charles-edwards, "at this stage of inquiry one can only say that there can be a historical Arthur
 Historians cannot say anything about him yet
" This modern admission of ignorance is a relatively recent trend; The earlier generations of historians had little doubt
 itihaaskaar jon morris ne up-roman britain or ireland ke itihaas da age of arthur main arthur ke tathakthith rajya ko apane itihaas ke aayojan kaa mukhya siddhant banaaya
 phir bhi unhen aitihaasik arthur ke bare main kehane ko bahut kam mila
 Other thought groups emerged as a partial reaction to such theories that argued that Arthur had no historical existence
 morris ke age of arthur ne puratatvavid noel myress ko nirikshan karne ke liye prerit kiya "itihaas or puraana kii seemaa rekha main koi aisa vyaktitv nahin he jisane itihaaskaar kaa itnaa adhik samay barbaad kiya ho

 Historian David Dumlisse wrote "I think we will sort out their plot very soon
 They have their place in our history book and a smoke group 'does not arise without fire'," believes it
 

 is maamle kaa tathy yah he ki arthur ke bare main koi aitihaasik saboot nahin he, ham unhen apane itihaas se, in sabase upar, apni pustakon ke ansh se khaarij kar sakate hai
 " kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki arthur multah lokkathaon ke ek kaalpanik nayak the - yaa yahaan tak ki ek arddh-vismrit kelt devtaa the - jinhen sudur ateet main sabhi kaaryon kaa vaastavik shrey diya jaataa tha
 His figure is compared with that of Kent's totem horse-gods, Hangest and Horus, which later became associated with historicity
 bede ne in mahaan vyaktiyon ko 5 veen sadi ke purvi britain ke anglo-saxon vijay kaa shrey diya he
 It is also not certain whether Arthur was considered a king in earlier texts
 Neither in Historia nor in Annales is he considered a "ruler": predecessors have instead called him the leader and soldier of war
 uttar-roman avadhi ke aitihaasik dastavej kam hai isliye arthur ke aitihaasik astitv ke prashn ke ek nishchit uttar kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Since the 12th century the places and places have been marked as Arthurian, but with archeological belief only the names have been revealed, which are found in secure references through inscriptions
 tathakthith arthur pathar 1998 main cornaval ke tintgel kile ke khandhar main paaya gaya jisamen 6 veen shatabdi ke sandarbhon ko surakshit paaya gaya, jisane ek sankshipt halchal paidaa kii lekin vah apraasangik sabit hua
 Other records of Arthur's evidence, including the Glastonbury Cross, have been described as forgery
 haalanki kai aitihaasik aankadon ko arthur ke liye aadhaar ke rup main prastaavit kiya gaya he, koi thos saboot inke abhinirdharanmen nahin ubhar paaya he
 The original Welsh name Arthur remains a subject of debate
 kuch kaa suzav he ki yah latin parivaar ke naam artorius se vyutpann hua he jo aspasht ke liye prayukt hota he, jise etimalji ne amaanya siddh karne kaa praytn kiya yaa itrusken mul kaa he)

 An alternative theory connects Arthur to Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation Boötes Circle, near the Great Bear called Ursa Major or the Great Bear
 naam kaa arth "bhaaluu ke sangrakshak" he
 In classical Latin the word Arcturus may have evolved from the ancient Latin Arturus and when it came to Welsh it would have become Artur
 On the basis of its brightness and its position in the sky, people will be revered as "guardians of bears" and being the leaders of other stars in the constellation
 It is important to note that it does not appear that Arcturus would have been used as a personal or divine name by the Romans
 The exact significance of such etymology is unclear
 yah aksar grahan kiya jaataa rahaa he ki ek Artorius se vyutpatti kaa matlab hoga ki arthur kii kinvadantiyon kaa vaastavik aitihaasik aadhaar tha lekin haal ke adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki yah dharna thik se sthapit nahin he
 In contrast, the derivation of an Arthur name from Arcturus indicates that the basis of Arthur's legends is non-historical
 arthur ke parichit saahitiyik vyaktitv ke nirmaataa monmouth ke jeffri the, unka chhadam aitihaasik historia rejum britaniye 1130 dashak main likhaa gaya tha
 Textual sources regarding Arthur were generally written before Geoffrey's Historia and those that were written after him and could not escape his influence

 In them there have been some attempts to define Arthur's nature and character as a whole rather than as a text or text / story in the pre-gulfridian tradition
 a recent academic survey by Thomas Green attempts to do this, identifying three key aspects of Arthur's portrayal based on this preceding material
 pehla yah he ki ve ek adwitiya yoddha the, jo britain par hamalaa karne vaale sabhi kshason se bachaate the or sabhi aantarik tathaa bahari khataron se raksha karte the
 Some of them were threats from humans such as the Saxons, from which they fought in Historia Britonum but most were supernatural including giant cat-demons, destructive divine pigs, dragons, dogheads, demons, and witches
 doosraa yah he ki purv galfridian arthur lokkathaon or sthaneey jaadui aashcharya-kahaniyon kaa charitra tha, jo alokik nayakon ke dal kaa mukhiya tha, jo jangalon or bhudrishy main rahata tha
 The third and final aspect is that Arthur had a close relationship with the Welsh spiritual world Annavan in early Welsh
 ek taraf ve duusari duniya ke bhawanon par khajaane kii khoj main hamale karte the or unke kaidiyon ko mukt kar dete the
 But on the other hand is the corpus of the oldest sources, including the pagan god, his wife and his possessions, which are apparently originally from another world

 In one stanza, the bravery of a warrior is praised by a man who killed 300 enemies, but in spite of that he also said that "he was not Arthur", it is said that his feats cannot be compared to Arthur's valor
 Can
 y Gododdin is known only from a 13th-century manuscript that makes it impossible to determine whether the text is original or has been published later, but John Koch believes the text to be of a 7th century date
 Or an earlier version could not prove this; It is often suggested to have dates from the 9th - or 10th century
 talsin ko kai kavitaaon kii rachana kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jiske baar main kaha jaataa he ki vah 6 veen shatabdi kaa ek kavi tha, jisane arthur kaa bhi ullekh kiya he, haalanki in sabaki sambhavit taarikh 8 veen or 12 veen shatabdiyon ke bich kii he
 They include "qadir Tearon", with reference to "arthur the Blessed", "preiedeau Annavan", which mentions an expedition to Arthur's other world, and "mervat Vathar Penn" which refers to Arthur's valor and Arthur and Uther
 There is a discussion of the father-son relationship that dates back to Geoffrey of Monmouth

 The Welsh prose saga Kalhwch & Olwen which is included in the modern Mbinogi collection has a very long list of Arthur's people with names of over 200 of them, though Si and Bedvar have again taken the central position
 yah kahani puure rup main arthur kii un kahaniyon kii he jisamen ve mukhyamantri yasabadadden kii beti olven ko paane ke liye asambhav kaaryon kii ek shrunkhlaa ko jeetne main, apane rishtedaar kalhavach kii madad karte hai, jisamen ek vishalkay ardh-alokik boar twarch twarch kaa shikaar shaamil he

 Later Triad manuscripts are partly taken from Geoffrey's Monmouth and later from continental traditions but which appear to have no such influence in the early years and are generally agreed to be the former Welsh tradition

 Arthur appears in a few other Latin texts, in addition to these pre-galfridian Welsh poems and stories, and the Historia Britonum and Annals Cumbrié

 According to the Life of Saint Gildas, written by Karadok of Lancarfan in the early 12th century, Arthur is said to have killed Gildas' brother Heil and rescued his wife Gwenhwifer from Glastonbury
 Written around 1100, some saints before the Life of St
 Kadok or Life of Lancarfan patronized a man who killed three of Arthur's soldiers, and Arthur demanded a herd of cattle in the form of his men in exchange for his men
 was
 kadok ne maang ke anuroop diya lekin jab arthur unhen le jane ke liye pashuon ke paas jaataa he, ve fern ke bandalon main badal jate hai
 Similar incidents are described in Carnoung, Padorn, and Ufflum, possibly medieval biographies written around the 12th century

 Important as Arthur's references are William's De Gestis Regam Angalorum of Malmesbury and Herman's De Mirachulis Sanctae Marre Laudensis, which together provide some evidence for the first time, providing the first definitive proof to believe that Arthur actually died Were not and in some places he returns, a subject that is frequently revisited in Gulfridian folklore Security has

 They include Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and Arthur's conception in which Uther Merlin magically recognizes his enemy Gorlois, sleeps with Gorlois' wife Igerna on Tintagel and conceives Arthur

 He then defeated the Picts and Scots of the Island and Orkney Islands before forming the Arthurian Empire through his campaigns of the island
 After twelve years of peace, Arthur came out once again to expand his empire and took control of Norway, Denmark and the French

 Geoffrey certainly seems to have used Arthur's list of twelve battles against the Saxons, in the 9th-century Historia Britonum, as well as the Kamalanan War of Annals Cambriae and the opinion that Arthur still remains Are alive arthur kaa vyaktigat str puure britain ke raja ke rup main bhi purv-galfridian parampara se liya hua he, jo kalhavch and olven, treeds or cents livs main paaya jaataa he
 Geoffrey eventually takes the names of many from Arthur's possessions, including family close, pre-gulfridian Welsh tradition attendants, including the names of Keus, Beduerus, Guenhuer, Uther, and possibly Kaliburnus, later Excalibur
 Banana which has follow-up Arthurian stories

 "therefore, for example, the Welsh Medrut is mischievously moderated by Geoffrey, but in the Welsh sources there is no indication of such a negative character until the 16th century

 "an antagonist from this point of view, Geoffrey Ashe, admits that Geoffrey's narrative is partially different from the source of the works of a 5th-century British king named Riotamus, the same character being the real Arthur, though historians and sulticists conclude Ashe's findings

 Thus for example about 60 manuscripts are included in the Welsh-language version of the Historia, first produced in the 13th century; The old belief that these earlier versions of Welsh are actually derived from Geoffrey's Historia, which was long advanced by scholars associated with ancient architecture, such as the late 18th century Lewis Morris, was abandoned by academic circles

 The popularity of Geoffrey's Historia and its other derivative works is generally agreed to be an important factor in explaining a significant number of new Arthurian works in continental Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France
 yah nahin tha, tathaapi "matter of britain" ke viksit hone par keval arthurian prabhaav tha
 "before Geoffrey's creation became widely known, there is clear evidence that the continent had knowledge of the Arthur and Arthurian stories, as well as the use of Celtic names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia in Arthurian Romance
 Perhaps the most significant effect of the new Arthurian story from Arthur's point of view is his extremely fluency in which the king himself plays
 is 12 veen sadi or baad ke arthurian sahitya kaa kendra lenslot, guenevere, perswal, galaahad, guin!, tristian or isolde kii tulana main swayan arthur kam hi rah gayi the
 While Arthur was at the very center of pre-galfridian literature and Geoffrey's own hysteria, he is increasingly sidelined in romance
 unke charitra ko bhi kaaphi badla gaya
 He is a great and staunch warrior, both of the early material and Geoffrey, who laughably murders witches and giants and takes the lead in all military campaigns, while in continental romance he is lazy and "nothing Doers ", whose" inaction and silent acceptance indirectly caused a central flaw in their ideal society

 Charatin wrote five Arthurian romances whose creation begins in AD 1170 and ends in AD 1190
 Erek and Eniday and Cliges are tales of Arthur's civilized love with Arthur pleading in the background, in which he is away from the heroic world of Wells and Gulfridian Arthur, while Yvonne and Gwen in The Night of the Lion Wales! Supernatural shows courage and Arthur is sidelined and weak
 haalanki, arthurian dantakatha ke vikaas ke liye sabase mahatvapurn lenslot, da nite of da cart hai, jisamen lenslot or unka vyabhichaari sambandh arthur kii rani ke saath he, aavarti vishay ko vistaar dene or lokapriy karne ke liye arthur ke kulata ke pati kii bhoomika or parasival, da story of da gril jisamen ek pavitra kanghee or fisher king se parichit karaayaa gaya he or usamen phir yah dekha gaya he ki arthur ko kahani main bahut kam bhoomika mili he
 Chretien thus played an "important role in both the expansion of the Arthurian narrative and the establishment of the ideal form for the spread of that narrative" and then laid the foundation for Arthur's portrayal in the context of his created world

 Even Chretienne's work appears in Welsh Arthurian literature, with the result that the romance began to replace the active Arthur literary tradition in Arthur Welsh
 Particularly important in this development are three Welsh Arthurian romances, which are quite close to Chretien, though: Owen, r The Lady of the Fountain from Chretien's Yvain, Geraint and Enid, and Erevac of Percival

 It is also mentioned by Mordred through an adulterous relationship between Arthur and his sister, and by establishing the role of Camelot, it is first mentioned in Chretien's demise in Lancelot in Arthur's primary court

 Similarly, Arthur is hardly an important character in these French prose romances compared to the younger character; He is the only important character in the Vulgate and Steyr de Merlin and Mort Artu himself

 The story that Mallory founded was originally titled The Whole Book of King Arthur and of His Noble Nights of the Round Table — the various previous editions of romance, particularly the Vulgate Cycle, and seems to be aimed at Arthurian stories
 Creating an extensive and authentic collection

 Interest in King Arthur declined at the end of the Middle Ages
 Although the English version of Mallory's Great French Romance was popular, there was an increase in attacks on the truth of the historical structure of the Arthurian Romance — the time of Geoffrey of Monmouth — and as such The validity of the case of the whole of Britain was an attack

 In the socially connected renaissance associated with the end of the medieval period, Arthur's character was conspired to steal, and legends about some of his powers were also stolen to fascinate the audience, which resulted in Mallory's Le Morte d'arthur in 1634
 Last seen in printing, which came after about 200 years

 Tennyson's work inspired a large number of followers, creating widespread interest in Arthur's stories, and bringing the character and Mallory's stories to a wider audience
 The truth is that Mallory's great compilation of Arthur's stories was first published in 1862 shortly after the arrival of the Idols with modernization and then six editions and five contestants before the end of the century
 "romance ke arthur" ke prati yah ruchi or unase sambaddh kahaniyaan puri 19 veen sadi main or 20 veen sadi main bhi barkaraar raheen or wiliam morris jaise kaviyon or pre-raphellite chitrakaaron ko prabhavit kiya jinamein, edward bern-jones bhi shaamil hai
 Even the humorous tale Tom Thumb, the primary manifestation of Arthur's legend in the 18th century, was rewritten after the publication of Idols
 jabaki tom ne apane chote aakaar ko banaae rakhaa or hasya kii raahat vaala charitra barkaraar rakhaa, uski kahani main ab madhyayugin arthurian romance se adhik tatwon ko shaamil kiya he or arthurako or adhik gambhirtha se or aitihaasik drushti se in nae sanskarnon main liya gaya he
 The revived Arthurian romance also proved to be influential in the United States, as did Sidney Lanier's book The Boys King Arthur and reached a wider audience and became the inspiration for the creation of Mark Twin's satirical a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court
 Although "arthur of Romance" has sometimes been at the center of these new Arthurian creations, on other occasions they revert to their medieval status and are either marginalized or even completely forgotten, Wagner's Arthurian Later in the opera provided a notable example

 Arthur's romance tradition is particularly clear, and according to critics, he has been subsumed by Robert Bresone in Lancelot du Lac, Eric Rohmer's Percival le Galloise and possibly John Barman in the fantasy film Excalibur; This is the main source of the Arthurian comic Monty Python and the Holy Grail

 However, the spread of Arthur has gone beyond such Arthurian efforts of contemporary culture, with the name Arthurian being regularly associated with objects, buildings and places
