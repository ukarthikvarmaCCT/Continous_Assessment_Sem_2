 In British culture, most traditional units start with a large number of counties which contain small divisions
 Within those entities are the large and small cities or towns, which may or may not be the county seat
 Some of the world's larger cities culturally, if not officially, span into multiple counties and those crossing state or provincial boundaries culturally are quite common as well, but are rarely incorporated within the same municipal government
 Many sister cities share a water boundary which quite often serves as a border of both cities and counties
 For example, Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts appear to the casual traveler as one large city, while locally they each are quite culturally different and occupy different counties

 High blood pressure is a risk factor for cognitive impairment, dementia, and complex kidney disease
 anya jatiltaaon main shaamil hai: Primary hypertension, the most common form of hypertension, accounts for 90–95% of all cases of hypertension
 lagbhag sabhi samakaleen samaajon main, umr badhane ke saath raktchaap badhata he tathaa baad ke jivan main ucch raktchaap se grast hone kaa khatra kaaphi bad jaataa he
 a complex combination of genes and environmental factors leads to hypertension

 Several environmental factors affect blood pressure
 jivan style se sambandhit kuch kaarak hai jo raktchaap kam karte hai jinamein aahaar main namak kii maatra kam karnaa, fal or kam vasa vaale utpaadon ko aahaar main badhanaa shaamil hai
 Exercise, weight loss and low alcohol consumption also help in lowering blood pressure
 anya karkon jaise tanaav, caffeine kii khapat, or vitamin di kii kami kii sambhavit bhoomika, kam spasht he
 Insulin resistance, which is common in obesity and a component of syndrome X, is also believed to contribute to hypertension
 haal ke adhyayanon se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki praarambhik jivan kii ghatnaayen aavashyak ucch-raktchaap ke liye jokhim kaarak hoti hai
 However, the mechanisms linking these risks to the problem of hypertension in adults are unclear
 dwitiyak ucch raktchaap kisi pahachaane ja sakane vaale kaaran kaa parinaam he
 Kidney disease is the most common among the secondary causes of hypertension
 ucch raktchaap, antahsravi sthitiyon jaise kushing syndrome, hyperthyradism, hypothyradism, echromigeli, con syndrome yaa hikereldostronism tathaa hyperparathyrirodism yaa fiochromocytoma ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, aortic shrinkage, excessive licorice consumption and some prescription drugs, herbal remedies, and illicit drugs
 sthapit moolbhoot ucch raktchaap vaale zyaadaatar logon main, cardiyak output saamaanya rahete huye rakt pravaah kaa badha hua pratirodh ucch dabaav ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 There is evidence that some young people with pre-hypertension or "borderline hypertension" have higher cardiac output, higher heart rate, and general peripheral resistance
 is sthiti ko hyperkainetic simavarti ucch raktchaap kaha jaataa he
 Typical symptoms of established hypertension develop in these individuals later in life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance increases as they age
 yah vivaad kaa vishay he ki yah pattern un sabhi logon par lagu hota he nahin jinamein antat ucch raktchaap kaa vikaas ho jaataa he
 The increased peripheral resistance in established hypertension is mainly due to the structural narrowing of the small arteries and arteries
 keshikaon kii sankhya yaa ghanatv main kami bhi paridhiy pratirodh main yogadan kar sakati he
 High blood pressure is also associated with a lack of flexibility in peripheral nerves, which can increase the return of blood to the heart, increase cardiac preload, and eventually lead to diastolic abnormality
 rakt vahikaaon kaa sakriy sankuchan sthapit moolbhoot ucch raktchaap main bhoomika nibhaataa he yaa nahin yah spasht nahin he
 The pulse pressure is often increased in the elderly with hypertension
 is sthiti main aisa systolic dabaav ho saktaa he jo ki asaamaanya rup se ucch ho, lekin diastolic dabaav saamaanya yaa kam ho saktaa he
 This condition is called isolated systolic blood pressure
 bujurg logon main ucch raktchaap yaa pruthak systolic ucch raktchaap ke saath ucch naadee dabaav ko badi huyi dhamneey kathorta dwaara samajha ja saktaa he jo aam taur par umr badhane ke saath juda hua he or ucch raktchaap ke dwaara or bighad saktaa he
 Several mechanisms have been proposed to increase the resistance seen within the arterial system in hypertension
 adhikansh sakshya in kaarnon main se ek yaa donon kii ore ishaara karte hai: These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and it is likely that both are responsible to some extent in most cases of basic hypertension
 yah bhi sujhaayaa gaya he ki endothelial asamaanyata or sanvahani sujan bhi bade huye paridhiy pratirodh or ucch raktchaap main sanvahani kshati ke liye yogadan kar sakate hai
 Hypertension is diagnosed when the patient is suffering from persistent hypertension

 For the primary prevention of hypertension, the 2004 guidelines of the British High Blood Pressure Society propose the following lifestyles that conform to the guidelines outlined by the US National High BP Education Program in 2002: prabhavi jivan style sanshodhan bhi raktchaap ko utana hi kam kar sakati he jitani ki koi raktchaparodhi dawa
 Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications may also produce better results
 ucch raktchaap ke liye ilaaj kaa pehla prakaar anumodith bachaav jivan style parivartanon ke samaan hi hai tathaa inamen aahaar sambandhi parivartan, shaareerik vyaayaam tathaa vazan main kameen shaamil hai
 These changes have shown to significantly reduce hypertension in people suffering from hypertension

 PH or ph is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution
 ise draveebhoot hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi ke sah-laghuganak ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 The activity coefficients of hydrogen ions cannot be measured experimentally, so they are based on theoretical calculations
 ph scale, koi sunishchit scale nahin he; iskaa sambandh maanak vilyan ke ek set ke saath hota he jiske ph kaa akalan antarrashtriya sanvida ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The concept of ph was first introduced in 1909 by the Danish chemist Sören Peder Lauritz Sørensen of the Carlsberg Laboratory
 yah abhi bhi agyaat he ki p kii sateek paribhaasha kya he
 Some references suggest that p signifies "power" and others refer to it as the German word "potenz", and still others refer to it as "potential"
 jens norbi ne 2000 main ek patr prakashit kiya jisamen usne tark diya ki p, ek sthiraank he or "rinatmak laghuganak" kaa pratik he; jiskaa prayog anya kaaryon main bhi kiya jaataa he
 h is a symbol of hydrogen
 sorensen ne suvidha ke liye "PH" sanket kaa suzav diya jo "power of hydrogen" kaa pratik he jisamen solution, p main hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ke sah-laghuganak kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Although this definition has been superseded
 yadi ek electrode ko gyaat hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ke solution ke saath anshakit kiya jaataa he to p ko mapa ja saktaa he
 Pure water is considered neutral

 Solutions with a ph less than 7 are called acidic and solutions with a ph greater than 7 are called alkaline or alkaline
 chikitsa shaastra, jeev vigyaan, rasayan shaastra, khaadya vigyaan, paryaavaran vigyaan, samudr vigyaan or kai anya anuprayogon main ph ke maapan kaa bahut mahatv he
 ph is defined as the decimal logarithm subtraction of the activity of hydrogen ion in an aqueous solution
 isaki laghuganakeey prakruti kii visheshta ke kaaran, ph, ek ayamarahit quantity he
 Where a h is the activity of hydrogen ions
 is paribhaasha kaa kaaran yah he ki a H, kisi ekal aayan kaa ek gun he jise keval ek aayan-chaynaatmak electrode kii sahaayta se prayogtmak rup se mapa ja saktaa he jo nernst sameekaran ke anusaar hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke saath pratikriya karata he
 The ph is usually measured with the help of a composite glass electrode that measures the potential difference or electromotive force, E, between an electrode sensitive to the activity of hydrogen ion and a reference electrode such as a calomel electrode or a silver chloride electrode
 is
 sanyukt glass electrode adarshatah nernst sameekaran kaa anusaran karata he: Where e is a measured potential and e 0 is the standard electrode potential ie the standard state electrode potential with activity also being one
 R, gas sthiraank he; T, kelvin taapmaana he; F, farade sthiraank he or n, hastantarit electrons kii sankhya kaa ek udhaaharan he
 The electrode potential, E, is proportional to the logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion
 yah paribhaasha apane aap main puri tarah se avyaavhaarik he kyonki hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi, sandratha or gatividhi gunank kaa gunanfal hota he
 The coefficient of activity of a single-ion of a hydrogen ion is a quantity that cannot be measured experimentally
 is kathinaayee se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye, electrode ko gyaat gatividhi ke solution ke sambandh main anshakit kar diya jaataa he
 The operational definition of ph is officially defined by the international standard ISO 31-8 as follows: For solution X, the galvanic cell's electromotive force, EX is measured | kcl kaa sandrit solution || solution x | H2 | Pt or tab ek galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e s ko bhi mapa jaataa he jo gyaat maanak ph ke solution s ke dwaara agyaat ph ke solution X, ph kii pratisthapana dwaara uparyukt se bhinn hota he
 Then x has a ph of solution x ke ph or maanak solution ke ph ke bich kaa antar keval do maape gaye potential ke bich ke antar par nirbhar karata he
 Thus, ph is obtained from a potential measured with an electrode calibrated against one or more ph standards; a ph meter setting is adjusted such that the reading of the meter of the standard solution is equal to the ph value
 maanak solution s ke ek range ke ph maanon ko, aage kii vistrut jaankaree ke saath, IUPAC kii anushansa main darshaya gaya he
 Standard solutions are often described as standard buffer solutions
 vyavhaar main, vaastavik electrode main nernst ke niyam kii adarshata se chote-chote vichlan ke liye anumati dene ke liye do yaa do se adhik maanak bafer kaa prayog karnaa behatar hota he
 Note that since temperature is found in the defining equations, the ph of the solution is temperature-based
 bahut kam ph maanon, jaise kuch bahut amleey khadaan ke jalon ke maapan ke liye vishesh prakriyaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such cases the calibration of the electrode can be done with a concentrated sulfuric acid standard solution whose ph values can be calculated using Pitzer parameters to calculate activity coefficients
 ph, ek amlata ke function kaa udhaaharan he
 The concentration of hydrogen ion can be measured in aqueous solvents, but this results in a different acidity function because the standard state of aqueous solvent is different from the standard state of water
 superacids, ajaleey amlon kaa ek varg he jiske liye hamet amlata ke function, h 0 ko viksit kiya gaya he
 This was Sorensen's original definition superseded in favor of ph
 haalanki, hydrogen yanon kii sandratha ko pratyaksh rup se maapna sambhav he, yadi hydrogen ke aayan kii sandratha ke sandarbh main electrode ko anshakit kiya jaataa he
 One way to do this, which has been used on a large scale, is to measure the solution of known concentrations of a strong acid with a solution of known concentrations of strong alkali in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte
 chunki acid or kshar kii sandratha gyaat hoti he isliye hydrogen yanon kii sandratha kii gananaa karnaa aasaan hota he taaki maape gaye potential ko sandratha ke saath sah-sambhddha kiya ja sake
 anshaakan kaa kaary praayah gran plot kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa he
 The calibration generates a slope factor, f and a value for the standard electrode potential, e 0, to form the Nernst equation
 main e ke praayogic maapan se hydrogen aayan sandratha ko praapt karne ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 The slope factor is usually slightly less than one
 0
95 se kam kaa ek slop factor yah darshata he ki electrode sahi dhang se kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during titration
 chunki yah sthir hota he isliye iske maan ko maanak sthiti ko paribhaashit karke ek main sthapit kiya ja saktaa he jo becoground electrolite yukt solution hota he
 Thus, the activity resulting from the use of this process is equated to the numerical value of the concentrations
 p or ph ke bich kaa antar bahut kam hota he
 It has been said that ph = p + 0
04
 Unfortunately, it is very common to use the noun "ph" for both types of measurements
 poh ko kabhi-kabhi kshariyata yaa hydroxide yanon, OH− kii sandratha ke ek maap ke rup main prayukt hota he
 poh cannot be measured independently but is derived from ph
 jal main hydroxide yanon kii sandratha, Is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions where KW is the constant of self-ionization of water
 nimna sah-laghuganak ko liya jaataa he So, at room temperature poh ≈ 14 - ph
 However, in other circumstances such as measurement of soil alkalinity, this relationship is not fully valid
 shuddh jal lagbhag 7 ph hota he; sateek maan, taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 When an acid is dissolved in water, the ph will be less than 7 and when an alkali or an alkali solution is made in water, the ph will be greater than 7
 The ph of a solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at 1 mol dm − 3 concentration is 0
 1 mol dm−3 sandratha par sodium hydroxide jaise kisi strong kshar ke solution kaa ph, 14 hota he
 Thus, the measured ph values will mostly be within 0 to 14
