 There should be proper arrangements for their appropriate departments for inversion, other Physiotherapy-procedures and phototherapy
 isse antarang vibhaag se rogi ko sheeghra neerog karke mukt kiya ja sakegaa or vahaan visham rogiyon kii chikitsa ke liye adhik sthaan or samay uplabdh hoga
 Emergency Section - An essential part of the outdoor department is the Emergency Department
 isamen ahernish 24 ghante kaam karne ke liye karmchariyon kii niyukti honi chahie
 Resident surgeons, nurses, orderly, child servants, scavengers, etc
 should be appointed in such a number that their services can be available to the patient round the clock
 is vibhaag main sankshobh kii chikitsa vishesh rup se kerani hogi
 For this reason, this department should be equipped with all necessary equipments and medicines for this treatment
 isaki tatparta tathaa dakshata par hi rogi kaa jivan nirbhar rahata he
 Therefore, the employees here should be proficient in their work, and all kinds of arrangements should be very good here
 glucose, plasma, rakt, taapachikitsa ke yantra, uttejk aushadhiyaan, injection aadi paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hone chahie
 There should also be a X-A plant, so that fracture, bone and rheumatic deformities can be determined by looking at the condition of the lungs or the condition of the heart
 yantron tathaa vastron aadi ke visankraman ke liye bhi purna prabandh hona aavashyak he
 If this department is under any educational institution, then it is necessary to have a lecture or demonstration room, which is large enough that all the students can sit there together
 shikshakon ke vishram ke nimitt tathaa shikshasaamagree rakhane or raatri main kaam karanevaale karmchaariyon ke liye bhi alag kamare hon
 There should be toilet in the entire department to be treated by levitation method
 aise shaujasthanon kaa karmchaariyon tathaa rogiyon ke liye pruthak pruthak hona aavashyak he
 While organizing this department, it is necessary to take full care of the work done there, the number of workers, the number of medical patients in each subdivision, their physical requirements and the permissible extension to be done in the future
 pratidin kaa anubhav he ki jis bhawan kaa aaj nirmaan kiya jaataa he vah thode hi samay main karyaadhiky ke kaaran aparyaapt ho jaataa he
 It is advisable to consider it in advance
 upar jo kuch kaha gaya he usase spasht he ki bahirang vibhaag main bahut adhik vyay karnaa padataa he
 In modern times, the principle of medicine is that no matter how much one dies, he should not be deprived of the best medical events and medicines due to his poverty
 is uddeshy kii purti ke liye kitne dhan kii aavashyaktaa he iskaa sahaj hi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he
 With the help of government, patriotism and well-to-do individuals, this objective should not be impossible
 antarang vibhaag main visham rogon tathaa rogi kii avasthaa ko dekhakar chikitsa karne kaa prabandh hota he
 According to the requirements of the province, city or region and the financial assistance available there, small or big departments are created
 thode rogiyon se lekar sahasr rogiyon ko rakhane tak ke antarang vibhaag banaae jate hai
 It all depends on sufficient funds and achievement of employees
 bahut baar dhan uplabdh hone par bhi upyukt karmchaaree nahin milte
 There is such a shortage of doctors in our country and Uttar Pradesh that so many hospitals are lying vacant
 iskaa kaaran he madhyam shrenee ke pariwaron kii upachaar vyavastha main aruchi
 For some social reasons, therapies are not seen very well; This is absolutely confusing
 janata kii aisi dharanaon main tanik bhi auchity nahin he
 After being admitted to the intimate department, the specialist makes full investigation of the patient's arrangements with the help of his assistants and the medical laboratory, X-ray department etc
 is kaaran in vibhaagon ko naveenatam upkarnon se susajjit rakhana aavashyak he
 Its importance is particularly high for the surgical department where the skill of employees and mutual support among them is essential for success
 kaksh-bal-sevak se lekar visheshgy sarjan tak sabake sahyog kii aavashyaktaa he
 All a single weapon can fail due to the inadvertence of only one nurse
 eks-re tathaa uttam aaparishan theatre is vibhaag ke atyant aavashyak ang hai
 Better treatment is the key to the success of the entire organization; This leads to the name or infamy of the hospital
 aspataal tathaa aadhunik chikitsapaddati kaa vishesh mahatvashaalee ang upachaarikas hai
 For this reason, it has been planned by the government to prepare best educated doctors
 aadhunik aspataalon kaa nirmaan ejineering kii ek vishesh kala ban gai he
 For the construction of hospitals, the medical department of the state has created model maps, taking into account the special needs and facilities of the hospital
 sab prakaar ke chote-bade aspataalon ke liye upyukt nakshe taiyaar kar die gaye hai jinke anusaar apekshit vistaar ke aspataal banaae ja sakate hai
 Before constructing a hospital, it is well understood that a hospital is a spending institution, not a money maker
 aadhunik aspataal banane ke liye aarambh main hi ek badi dhanrashi kii aavashyaktaa padati hai; use niyamit rup se chalaane kaa kharch usase bhi bada prashn he
 It is a mistake to build a hospital without managing it
 dhan kii kami ke kaaran aage chalakar bahut kathinaayee hoti he or aspataal kaa nimnlikhit uddeshy puraa nahin ho saktaa: Natvahan kamay states, heaven heaven napurnabhavam
 kaamaye du:khatptanam praninamarthinationam
 
 hamaara desh ati vistrut tathaa uski jansankhya atyadhik he
 Similarly, the medical questions here are equally detailed and complex
 phir janata kii nirdhantaa tathaa shiksha kii kami is prashn ko or bhi jatil kar detii he
 For this reason, committees have been appointed several times by the government to study the requirements of medical management
 bhor cameti ne jo siforishein kii hai aanake anusar prayek 10 se 12 sahasr jansankhya ke liye 75 rogiyon ko rakhane yogya ek aisa aspataal hona chahie jisamen chah doctor or chah upachaarikas tathaa anya karmchaaree niyukt hon
 This will be called the primary organ
 aise 20 praathmik angon par ek madhyamik ang bhi aavashyak he
 The hospital here has a provision of keeping 1,000 intimate patients
 yahan prayek chikitsashakha ke visheshgy niyukt hon tathaa paricharikas or anya karmchaaree bhi hon
 X-ray, Rajyakshma, surgery, medicine, vascular, obstetric, orthopedic etc
 all departments should be different
 madhyamik ang se pare ore usase bada, kendriya yaa jile kaa vibhaag yaa ang ho, jahaan un sab prakaar kii chikitsaaon kaa prabandh ho, jinka prabandh madhyamik ag ke aspataal main na ho
 This is also the place for the largest operator
 is aayojan kaa samast anumit vyay bharat sarkaar kii sampurna aay se bhi adhik he
 Because of this the scheme has not been implemented yet
 aajkal jansankhya or usee ke anusaar rogiyon kii sankhya main vruddhi hone se vishesh prakaar ke aspataalon kaa nirmaan aavashyak ho gaya he
 The first requirement is to set up a separate hospital for spontaneous diseases, where only sixteen patients are kept
 isi prakaar rajakshma ke rogiyon ke liye pruthak aspataal aavashyak he
 Separate hospitals are necessary in big cities for mental diseases, astigmatics, pediatric, gynecological, obstetric, disability etc
 chote nagaron main ek hi aspataal main kam se kam bhinn-bhinn apekshit vibhaag bananaa aavashyak he
 These hospitals also have to be constructed in different ways according to their needs and in the same way employees are appointed there
 in sab prakaar ke aspataalon ke maanchitr tathaa vahaan kii samast aavashyaktaaon kii suchi sarkaar ne taiyaar kar di he, jinke anusaar sab prakaar ke aspataal banaae ja sakate hai
 In big cities, where there is always a shortage of hospitals, after being freed from the extreme condition, a separate department - hospital - is necessary for weak health-oriented people and patients with very timely treatment
 isse aspataalon kii bahut kuch kathinaayee kam ho jaati he or ugravastha ke rogiyon ko rakhane ke liye sthaan sugamawa se mil jaataa he
 Nowadays social service has become a part of medicine and the importance of social service is increasing day by day in the hospital and medicine
 aushadhopchaar ke atirikt rogi kii maansik, kautumbik tathaa saamaajik paristhitiyon kaa adhyayan karnaa or rogi kii tajjanya kathinaaiyon ko dur karnaa samajasevi kaa kaam he
 What are the difficulties that his family is facing in his illness during his illness and what difficulties will he face after the patient is freed from the disease or from the hospital, what will be the effect on the patient, etc
 All these things are subjects of study and treatment of philanthropists
 yadi rogamukt hone ke pashchaat vah vyakti arthsankat ke kaaran kutumbpaalan main asamarth rahaa, to vah pun: rogagrast ho saktaa he
 It is the duty of a social worker to manage how his family's economic problems are solved in the time of disease
 is prakaar kii prayek samasya samajasevi ko hal kerani padati he
 With this, the importance of social service in medicine can be understood
 ugr rog kii avasthaa main upachaarak yaa upachaarika kii jitani aavashyaktaa he, rogamukti ke pashchaat us vyakti ke swasthya kii raksha tathaa jivan ko upyogi banane main samajasevi kii bhi utani hi aashyakataa he
 The main purpose of hospitals in the institutions of medical education is the medical education and investigation of students
 is kaaran aise chikitsaalayon ke nirmaan ke siddhant kuch bhinn hote hai
 There are different departments for the education of each subject
 inamen vidhyaarthiyon kii sankhya ke anusaar rogiyon ko rakhane ke liye samuchit sthaan rakhana padataa he, jisamen aavashyak shayyaayein rakhi ja saken
 Also, so much space has to be left between the beds so that the teacher and his students can stand near the patient and examine him and the teacher can demonstrate and discuss the symptoms of the patient
 is kaaran aise aspataalon ke liye adhik sthaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti hai
 Then, each department has to be fully equipped with modern instruments, equipments etc
 ve shiksha ke liye aavashyak hai
 Therefore, the construction and organization of such hospitals cost much more than ordinary hospitals
 shikshakon ore karmchaariyon kii niyukti bhi keval shreshthatam vidwaanon main se, jo apane vishay ke maanya vyakti hon, kii jaati he
 Therefore, the Indian Medical Council has prepared the complete details of the construction, decoration and staff of such institutions in order to increase the daily expenditure of such hospitals
 yahi council desh bhar kii shikshasansthaaon kaa niyantran karti he
 Council does not give recognition to the institution which does not reach the criteria set by it and the students there are deprived of their right to sit in higher examinations
 shiksha ke str ko ucchtam banane main is council ne stuty kaam kiya he
 In such hospitals, the special question is of sufficient space
 kamaron kaa aakaar or sankhya donon ko hi adhik rakhana padataa he
 Then, after taking into account the requirement of each department, number of students and teachers, etc
, the plan of the hospital has to be prepared

 Christian socialism is a form of religious socialism based on the teachings of Jesus Christ
 samaajwaadiyon kaa uddeshy he nijee sampatti par niyantran or atmabhivyakti ke avasaron main vruddhi
 But what should be its means, what is the goal of a socialist system, violently or non-socially, the process of social change and its logic - on these and other related questions, the general objectives of socialist ideologies can be distinguished by some basic principles of Christianity

 The group extended eastward to Chatian, along with the currents of the Antarctic Pole, about 28 mya ago, presumably by descendants of modern penguins
 While the two generations diverged in the meantime, the current diversity is as a result of pilosin radiation, which spanned 4–2 Mya

 is adhinium ko multah agast 1935 main paarit kiya gaya tha or ise us samay ke adhiniyamit sansad kaa sabase lanbaa adhinium kaha jaataa tha
 Because of its length, the Government of India Act 1935 was divided into two separate Acts in response: bhartiya raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik itihaas par sahitya main sandarbh ko aamtaur par bharat sarkaar 1935 adhinium ko sankshipt rup mana jaataa he, bajaay adhinium ke paath ke rup main mul rup se adhiniyamit karne ke liye The most important aspects of the Act were: haalanki, swaittata kii degree prantiy str kii shuruuaat mahatvapurn simaaon ke adheen tha: prantiy governor mahatvapurn arakshit shaktiyon ko barkaraar rakhaa or british adhikariyon ne bhi ek jimmedaar sarkaar ko nilambit adhikaar banaae rakhaa
 The demand for parts of the Act was to establish the Union of India but never came into operation due to opposition from the rulers of the princely states
 jab adhinium ke tahat pehla chunaav kaa aayojan hua tab adhinium kaa shesh bhaag 1937 main lagu hua
 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the Indian people have consistently demanded a greater role in the government of their country

 While the Act was a reflection of the demand of Indians to play a larger role in government, it was also a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in India's system
 dvishasan ke saath prayog asantoshjanak sabit hua
 a particular disappointment for Indian leaders was that in areas where they gained only nominal control, the "main authority" was in the hands of the British bureaucracy
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon kii samiksha kaa iraadaa kiya gaya tha or un rajasi rajyon jo ise sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar the
 However, a split between the Congress and the Muslim representatives proved to be the main factor to prevent the settlement as the system had significant knowledge of the Sangh's functioning

 is white paper ke aadhaar par, bharat sarkaar ke bill kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Committee level and later bigotry was pacified, "security" strengthened and indirect elections for the Central Legislative Assembly were re-organized
 bill ko vidhivat agast 1935 main kanoon main paarit kiya gaya
 One consequence of this process is that, although the Government of India Act of 1935 should have gone a little further to meet Indian demands, both the expansion of the bill and the lack of Indian participation in its draft material meant that India The act proved to be radical for a significant element in Britain, while having the act with the best blunt response
 yadhyapi prastaavna ko shaamil karne ke liye british sansad ke adhiniyamon ke liye yah asaamaanya ho gai, bharat sarkaar ke adhinium 1935 se ek kii kami 1919 ke adhinium ke saath virodhabhas ho gai, jiske chalate bhartiya raajnneetik vikaas ke liye usase sambandhit us adhinium kaa uddeshy ke vyapak darshan ko sthapit kiya
 On 20 August 1917, the Preamble of the 1919 Act is quoted based on the statement of Edwin Montagu, Minister of India for the House of Commons, which promises: 


british samrajya ke ek abhinn hissaa ke rup main bharat main jimmedaar sarkaar kii pragatisheel prastuti ke liye ek darshan ke saath swayan-shaasi sanstha kaa dhire-dhaare vikaas he
 Indian demands with existing Dominions such as Canada and Australia now had to achieve constitutional parity in British India, which meant complete autonomy in the British Commonwealth
 british raajnneetik cirkil main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke kaaran shaq kiya ki bhartiya is aadhaar par unke desh ko chalaane main sakasham the or paryaapt "suraksha" ke saath, shaayad, kramik sanvaidhanik vikaas kii ek lambii avadhi ke baad ek uddeshy ke rup main dominian sthiti ko dekha
 This tension between them and the vision within the Indian and the British resulted in the clumsy agreement of the 1935 Act which had no preamble of its own, but the preamble of the 1919 Act replaced it, yet repealed the remnants of that act
 saamaanya rup se ise british se adhik mishrit sandeshon ke rup main bharat main dekha gaya, jo ki apane taraf se nirutsahi ravaiya ko sujhaati thi or bhartiya ichchhaaon ko santusht karne kii disha main "nunatam aavashyak" ke nikrushtatam drushtikon kaa suzav detii thi
 Unlike most modern constitutions, but common with Commonwealth constitutional law of the time, the Act did not incorporate the "bill of rights" within the new system that was intended to be established
 haalanki, bharat sangh ke prastaavit maamle main vahaan adhikaron ke ek set ko shaamil karne main kuch jatiltaayen thim, jaisaa ki nai ikai main nammaatr prabhutv rajasi rajyon shaamil the
 However a different view was considered by some and the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report incorporated the bill's authority
 1947 main, adhinium main ek apekshaakrit kuch sanshodhano se bharat or pakistan ke antarim karyanvan samvidhan banaaya gaya
 The Act was not only extremely elaborate, but it was surrounded with a 'security standard', designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it was needed to maintain British responsibilities and interests

 However, doing so without any precise reason would have eroded their credibility with groups of India whose aim was to achieve the Act
 kuch visham vichaar: "in the federal government

 It would be of great interest to see the development of the creation of a highly specialized government; Certainly, if it operates successfully, the most credit will go to the political ability of Indian leaders who have faced more serious difficulties than colonial politicians who developed a system of self-government that is now Dominion level

 vahaan koi vaastavik satta ko centre main sammanit main nahin kiya gaya
 (report of Bulabhai Desai in the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Indian Constitutional Reform on 4 February 1935
 haalanki, udaaravaadi or congress main bhi tatv kunkunepan ke saath ise jane ke liye taiyaar the: "linlithgow asked Sapru whether he thought the scheme of Act 1935 was a satisfactory option
 sapru ne kaha ki unhen adhinium ko teji se lagu karnaa chahie or sangheey yojana usamen sannihit he
 This was not an ideal, but it is the only one at this stage
 


 kuch dinon ke baad sapru, vysarai se milane birla aayaa tha
 He thought that the Congress was moving towards the Sangh's acceptance
 birla ne kaha ki kendra ke liye raksha or videshi maamle ke aarakshan ke dwaara gandhi isse zyada chintit nahin the lekin rajyon ke pratinidhiyon ko chunane ke tareeke par dhyaan de rahe the
 Birla wanted the Viceroy to help Gandhi in choosing certain kings towards the democratic election of the delegates
 


 Then Birla said that this is the only chance of agreement between the government and Congress and discussion between Gandhi and Viceroy is the best hope
 " The British government sent Lord Linlithgow as the new Viceroy to bring the Act into effect
 linlithgo kaaphi budhimaan, behad mehnatee, eemaandaar, gambhir or is adhinium ko safal banane ke liye drudh sankalp tha, haalanki vah bhi niras, aavegahin, vidhi sammat tha or apane tatkaal cirkil ke baahar logon ke saath "sharton ko lagu karnaa" bahut mushkil mahasoos kiya
 In 1937, after a great deal of confrontation, provincial autonomy was introduced
 us bindu se 1939 main yuddh kii ghoshnaa tak, linlithgo ne lagaataar sangh kii shuruuaat karne ke liye raajaaon se sammilat hone kaa bharsak prayaas kiya
 In this he received very little support from the domestic government and the kings eventually rejected the Federation en masse
 sitambar 1939 main, linlithgo ne saamaanya rup se ghoshnaa kii ki bharat yuddh main germany ke saath gaya tha
 Although Linlithgow's behavior was constitutionally correct, it was quite offensive to Indian views
 iske chalate congress ke prantiy mantralayon ke saadhe istife kii ore agrasar hua jo bhartiya ekta ko kamjor kar diya
 From 1939, Linlithgow focused on supporting the war effort

 They are based on a Walt Disney theme park ride of the same name and follow Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann

 pehali film kii anpekshit safalataa ke baad, walt dijani pikchars ne batalaaya ki ek rachana tray par kaam chal rahaa tha
 Sea Robbers: Corpse Treasure was released in 2006 after three years
 isaki uttar katha bahut safal sabit hui, iske premier ke din isane duniya bhar main record tode
 ant main ise duniya bhar main box offis par kul $1,066,179,725 hasil hue, yah chauthi or sabase tej film bani jo is raashi tak pahunchi

 So far, the film has grossed over $ 2
68 billion worldwide
 sitambar 2008 main, dep ne chauthi film ke liye anubandh kiya, samundar ke lutere: ek anjaan safar 20 may 2011 ko release kii gai
 During the early 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio thought of writing a film based on Pirates of the Caribbean ride
 dijani ne je volport se sawari par aadhaarit ek script likhavai, jo nirmaataa jeri brukhimar ne asweekaar kar di, unhen laga ki yah "ek sateek samudri daaku film he"
 unki samudri dakaiti ke bare main jaankaree kii vajah se, stuart bieti ko march 2002 main script ke punarlekhan ke liye laayaa gaya, or usee maheene baad main iliyat va rozio ko laayaa gaya
 Elliot and Rozio were inspired by the early description of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride and decided to give the film a supernatural edge
 jaise hi bajet upar gaya, maaikel isionar or robert igar ne film ko radd karne kii dhamkee di, haalanki brukhimar ne avadharana kala or anemeshan dikhaa kar unka man badal diya
 In May 2002, Gore Verbinski signed on to direct Seaside Robbers: The Curse of Black Pearl, and the following month Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush signed on to act
 verbinski aadhunik praudyogiki ke upyog ke vichaar se aakarshith hue, jo us style ko punerjeevit karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha jo hollywood ke sunahare yug ke baad gaayab ho gai thi or unhen sawari se judi apni bachapan kii yaadon kaa samaran hua, unhen laga ki yah film iske "daraavne or hasyamay" swar ko shradhanjali dene kaa ek avasar tha
 Depp was attracted to the story because he found it bizarre: Instead of trying to find the treasure, the Black Pearl crew was trying to return it to remove his curse; And the traditional rebellion had already taken place
 verbinski ne rash ko barbosa kii bhoomika ke liye sampark kiya, kyonki vah jaanate the kii vah ise jatilta ke prayaas se nahin balki saral khalnaayaki se nibhaayenge jo kahani ke swar ke anukool hoga
 orlando bloom ne rash, jinke saath vah ned keli par kaam kar rahe the, ke suzav dene ke baad script padhi
 keira nitaly, verbinski ke liye ek aashcharya ke rup main ain: unhone bend it like bekaham main unka pradarshan nahin dekha tha or unke audishan se prabhavit hue
 tom wilkinson ke saath swaan rajyapal kaa abhinay karne ke liye baatcheet hui, lekin yah bhoomika jonathan price ko mil gai, jinhen dep apana adarsh maanate the
 The shooting of The Curse of the Black Pearl began on 9 October 2002 and was completed by March 2003
 isaki relies se pehle, kai logon kaa anumaan tha ki film purnatah asafal ho jaaegi, kyonki samudri daaku style kai saalon se safal nahin hui thi, yah film ek theme park sawari par aadhaarit thi or johny dep ne shaayad hi kabhi badi film banaai thi
 But The Curse of the Black Pearl was successful both critically and commercially
 film kaa pradarshan dekhakar, abhinayta varg or karmidal ne do or uttar kathaon, jo aage-peeche banaai jane vaali thi, ke liye sin kiya, yah dijani kii taraf se ek hi abhinayta varg or karmidal ke saath kaam karne kaa ek kriyaatmak nirnay tha
 Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio knew that with an ensemble actor class they were not free to create completely different positions and actors, as happened with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and therefore The Curse of The Black Pearl had to make the first of the composition triad according to prior activity
 They wanted to find out what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of the first film and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as a plot device
 He decided to introduce Davy Jones, The Flying Dutchman and The Kraken, a devotha which is mentioned only twice in the first film
 unhone aitihaasik east india trading company kii bhi shuruyaat kii, jo unke liye samudri daakuon dwaara pratinidhitiv vyaktigat swatantraaa ke vishyon ke poorak kaa pratinidhitiv karti thi
 The filming of the north stories began on 28 February 2005, at 8:30 am, the dead treasure was completed on 1 March 2006, and the last watch on 10 January 2007
 Currently a third north story, The Pirates of the Seas: An Unknown Journey Is Becoming
 , Which is scheduled to return to old actor class members, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush
 chauthi kisht main keira nitaly or orlando bloom sahit kai anya abhinayta varg sadsy dikhaai nahin denge
 film kaa kaary 14 june 2010 ko shuru hoga
 To be freed from the curse that came after stealing Aztec gold, the Black Pearl crew representing Hector Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the Governor of the Royal Port

 Lord Cutler Beckett, a powerful and ruthless East India Trading Company agent, arrests Will and Elizabeth, because they helped Jack Sparrow escape in the previous film
 bekket haalanki kshamaadaan dene kaa prastaav rakhata he yadi vil turnar spairo or uske compass ko khojane ke liye sahamat ho to
 usee samay, spairo swayan ko khalanaayak davy jones ke ek puraane qarz se mukt karne kii koshish karata tha
 Lord Cutler Beckett gains more power than Davy Jones, and with the help of Jones' ship, The Flying Dutchman now executes the plan to end the robbery forever
 east india trading company ke khilaaf khadey hone ke liye vil, elizabeth, barbosa or blike parl kaa dal jaik spairo ko davy jones ke lakar se bachaane ke liye jaataa he, kyonki vah nau samudri daaku saradaaron main se ek tha, jisaki madad se ek pracheen devi ko bulaayaa ja saktaa tha
 Writer Tim Powers reports that Disney has bought the film rights to the 1988 pirate novel "on Stranger Tides", which will loosely be based on the fourth film
 The author of Pirates, Terry Rozio, stated that he would use some elements from that novel, but the film would not be based on it
 film main, captain jaik spairo or captain hectares barbosa fountain of youth dhundne ke liye ek saahasik kaary par jate hai
 Actors from previous films, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, have signed on to change their roles, respectively, after wanting to return as their characters

 Basically, this idea expresses the advanced stage of socialism
 jahaan samaajwaad main kartavya or adhikaar ke vitaran ko 'harek se apni kshamtanusaar, harek ko karyaanusaar' ke sutara se niyamit kiya jaataa he, vahiin samyawad main 'harek se kshamtanusaar, harek ko aavashyaktaanusaar' siddhant kaa lagu kiya jaataa he
 Communism prohibits personal property
 pratham vishwayuddh, samaajawaadee andolan ke liye ek mahatvapurn ghatana thi
 While on the one hand the socialist movement and their international organization almost disintegrated at the beginning of it, on the other hand, there was a Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the foundation of the first successful socialist state in the world, which had a profound impact on the socialist movements of the world
 
 pratham mahayuddh ke purv samaajawaadee dalon kaa mat tha ki poonjivadi vyavastha hi yudhon ke liye uttaradaayi he or yadi vishwayuddh aarambh hua to prayek samaajawaadee dal kaa kartavya hona chahie ki vah apni poonjeewaadi sarkaar kii yudhniti kaa virodh kare or grihayuddh dwaara samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye prayatnsheel ho
 But as soon as the war started, except for the socialist parties of Russia and Italy, the majority of all the parties supported the policy of their governments
 samaajwaadiyon ke keval ek naganya alpamat ne hi yuddh kaa virodh kiya or aage chalakar inamen se kuch vladimir lenin or uske samyavaadee antarrashtriya sanghathan ke samarthak bane
 But due to the conflicting tactics of the socialist movements of different countries, their unity came to an end
 bolshevik dal rus ke kai samaajawaadee dalon main se ek tha
 It was successful under the special circumstances of 1917
 roosi samaajwaad kii parshwabhoomi anya europea samaajawaadon kii sthiti se bhinn thi
 The Russian Empire was lagging behind the leading countries of Europe in industry trade, so the majority of the working class could not be more influential here
 yahan loktantratmak shashan or vyaktigat swadhinataon kaa bhi abhaav tha
 The Russian intelligentsia and the middle class were keen on them, but due to jargon repression, the constitutional path of their attainment was blocked

 Among those thinkers are Hergen, Lavrov, Charnyshevsky and Bakunin
 inase prabhavit hokar anek buddhijivi kranti kii ore agrasar hue
 In this way the foundation of Narodnik mass movement was laid and Narodanya Volya organization was formed
 san 1901 main iskaa naam saamaajik krantikari party rakhaa gaya
 By the time of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, it was the largest socialist party in Russia, but its area of influence was mostly rural people
 iske vam paksh ne bolshevik kranti kaa samarthan kiya
 The second socialist ideology, which included the Bolshevik Party, is also known as the Russian Social People's Labor Party
 iskaa prabhaav mukhyat: naagarik majdoor varg main tha
 Industries in Russia were few, but large in scale and hired more workers than expected
 at: in mazdooron main raajnneetik chetana or sanghathan adhik tha
 In the absence of democracy, it was difficult for the workers to struggle, so the working class came under revolutionary influence and due to the conditions like Germany, most of the labor leaders here were also influenced by Marxist and Germany's Social Democratic Party
 san 1890 ke lagbhag excrod or plekhanov ne petersvarg main pratham majdoor samooh sthapit kiye jo aage chalakar 1898 main roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke aadhaar bane
 The leader of the Russian Social Democratic Democratic Labor Party was a staunch Marxist, so he rejected recapitalism and developed Marxism and applied it to Russian conditions
 mazdooron kii rahan sahan ke str main unnati hui thi, is satya ko na maananaa kathin tha, parantu plekhanov ne siddh kiya ki nai mashiinon ke prayog or mazdooree main apekshaya vruddhi na hone ke kaaran poonjeewaadi shoshan kii dar badhati ja rahi he
 Bukharin argued that imperialist countries were able to keep their working class satisfied by exploiting the colonies
 tratski aadi ne kaha ki poonjeewaadi kaa sankat sarvyaapee ho gaya he or is sthiti main yah sambhav he ki kranti pashchim europe ke agrani deshon main na hokar apekshaakrit pichde deshon main, jahaan samrajyavaadee kadi sabase kamjor he, vahaan ho
 Some thinkers first showed Russia the location of the socialist revolution
 tratski or lenin kaa mat tha ki samaajawaadee kranti usee samay safal ho sakati he jab vah kai deshon main ek saath faile, sthaayee kranti ke bina keval ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana kathin he
 Later Lenin and Stalin amended this principle to create Soviet power on the basis of unilateral socialism
 nikolai lenin ne uparyukt vichaaron kaa samanvay karke bolshevik dal kaa sanghathan or oktober kranti kaa netritv kiya
 At the London Conference of 1903, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party articulated its socialist ideal, but within this class party two ideologies emerged and later they formed two parties
 is conference main utpaadan ke sadhano ke rashtriyakaran, jameendaari unmoolan, upniveshon kaa aatmanirmaan kaa adhikaar, dhyey kii prapti kaa krantikari maarg or kranti ke baad sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee-is niti ko sweekaar kiya gaya, parantu dal ke sanghathan ke sambandh main netaaon main matbhed ho gaya
 The question was whether the membership of the party should be limited only to the workers or every person accepting the ideals should be its officer and should the Central Committee have the right to dissolve the branches of the party and appoint new branches in their place? Lenin was in favor of a well-organized party with military discipline and had a majority in the conference, hence the name of this section was Bolshevik and the second section was called Menshevik
 aage chalakar in dalon ke bich or bhi matbhed upasthit hue
 The Menshevik Party first wanted to end the capitalist democratic revolution of the end of Tsarism and in this revolution, it wanted to cooperate with the left side of the capitalist parties, but after the revolution of 1905, Lenin and his companions came to the conclusion that due to fear of socialist revolution, capitalism Has become reactionary, therefore it is also unable to lead the capitalist democratic revolution
 isliye is kranti kaa netritv bhi keval sarvhaara varg hi kar saktaa he or is kranti ko sarvhaara kranti ke saath milakar jaarshahi ke baad ekadam samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav he
 Lenin was in favor of dividing feudal land among the peasants to get the support of the peasants in the revolution, the Mensheviks wanted to socialize it immediately
 bolshevik dal ne pratham mahayuddh kaa virodh kiya or samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye grihayuddh kaa naaraa diya
 The war-torn public, and especially the Russian troops, welcomed this policy, but the Mensheviks did not oppose the war and continued the war by joining the government after the February March revolution
 san 1917 kii oktober kranti main lenin ke vichaaron or bolshevik sanghathan kii vijay hui
 After the Paris Commune of 1871, in 1917, the first permanent socialist state - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was established
 is rajya main utpaadan ke sadhano-udyog dhandhe, vyapaar, vinimay, bhoomi aadi-kaa rashtriyakaran kiya gaya or shoshak varg kii aarthik tathaa raajnneetik shakti kaa ant kar diya gaya
 Within the country, initially the representatives of peasants, laborers and soldiers were ruled by mixed Soviets, but according to the constitution of 1936, a bicameral parliament was established
 iske upree sadan kaa chunaav soviet desh ke vibhinn ganraajyon dwaara hota he tathaa nimna sadan ke sadsy kshetreey nirvachan kshetron dwaara chune jate hai
 But Soviet countries are one-party states, the state power is in the hands of communist party
 kisi duusare dal ko raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar nahin
 After the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party named itself the Communist Party and in 1919 published a second Communist Manifesto, on the basis of which a new international movement - Communist International - was established and with its help started the propagation of communism in various countries
 lenin ke vichaaron ko samyawad kii sangya di jaati he, parantu lenin ke baad joseph stallin maotsethung nikita chrishchov tathaa vibhinn deshon ke samyavaadee netaaon ne in vichaaron kii vyakhya or unka vikaas kiya he
 All these ideas fall under the category of communism
 stallin ke vichaaron main uskaa upniveshon ko aatmanirnay kaa adhikaar, niojit arthvyavastha arthath panchavarshiya aadi yojanaayen tathaa samuhik or rajkeey swaamitv main kheti mukhya hai
 The impact of socialism increased in the world between the Second World War and after the success of Soviet forces and other international conditions
 yuddh kaa ant hone tak na keval purvi europe soviet prabhavakshetra ban gaya, varan san 1948 i
 tak inamen se adhikansh deshon main samyavaadee rajya sthapit ho gaye
 In Asia too, communism was successful in a large country like China and under the influence of Soviet and People's Republic of China, the rule of North Asia and North Vietnam came under communist influence
 samyawad kaa asar sabhi deshon main badha
 Countries such as France, Italy and Hindustia have powerful communist parties
 parantu samyawad ke prasar ne us andolan ke saamne kai saidhantik or vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyaan upasthit kii hai- Communist Yugoslavia's ruler Josip Brozovit Tito and his other communist allies were the first to challenge the Soviet leadership
 yugoslavia bahut kuch apane prayatnon se swatantra hua tha at: uske andar swabhimaan kii bhaavana thi
 He was also not surrounded by Soviet influence like other communist countries of East Europe
 yugoslav paksh kaa kahana tha ki soviet sarkaar unki audyogic unnati main baadhak he tathaa unki swatantraaa ko simit karti he
 His stanzas later proved to be true, but at that time Titoism was called the pivot of recidivism, Trotskyism or imperialism
 siddhant ke str par titowad ne rashtriya samyavad, shakti ke vikendrikaran, kisaanon dwaara bhoomi kaa nijee swaamitv, rajya or naukarshahi ke sthaan main udyogon par mazdooron kaa niyantran tathaa samyavaadee dal or desh ke andar apekshaakrit adhik swadhinata par jor diya
 Tito's ideas have had an impact on other communist countries in Eastern Europe
 samyavaadee deshon ke bich samanta kii maang ko sweekaar karke khrushchov ne titowad ko anshat: sweekaar kiya, parantu saath hi usne lenin stallinavaad main bhi kai mahatvapurn sanshodhan kiye hai
 Lenin thought that until the end of imperialism, there would be war in the world, but according to Khrushkov, at this time the powers of progress are so strong that world war can be stopped and peaceful coexistence between capitalist and socialist systems is possible
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki in paristhitiyon main samaajwaad kii sthapana kaa keval krantikari maarg hi nahin he, varan vibhinn deshon main alag alag samyavaadee dalon dwaara vikasvaadi or shantimay tareekon se bhi uski sthapana sambhav he
 In the other countries of the world, the above thought change has had a profound effect on communist ideology
 tito ke vidroh ke baad purv europe ke anya samyavaadee deshon ne bhi soviet prabhaav se swatantra hone kaa praytn kiya he
 The Russian communists reject Khrushchev's amendments and the military conflict between the Soviet and China is not only getting worse
 sansar ke lagbhag sabhi samyavaadee dal soviet or chini vichaardhaaraon ke aadhaar par vibhakt hote ja rahe hai kuch vichaarak rashtriya samyavaadee dalon kii saidhantik or sanghathanaatmak swatantraaa par bhi jor dete hai
 Thus the unity and internationalism of communist ideas and movement is declining
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad samyawad kii hi nahin loktantratmak samaajwaad kii bhi pragati hui he
 In the midst of the two great wars Britain had twice as many working governments
 pratham mahayuddh ke baad germany or austria main samaajawaadee shashan sthapit hue; france or spain aadi deshon main samaajawaadee dalon kii shakti badi
 But soon their response also started
 san 1922 main benito musolini ne italy main phacist shashan sthapit kiya
 Fascism is an enemy of labor and socialist movements and a supporter of war and imperialism
 vah poonjeewaadi vyavastha kaa ant nahin karata
 The basic principles of Nazism are similar to fascism
 is vichaardhaara kaa prachaarak adolf hitler tha
 After the economic crisis of 1929, Natsi rule was established in Germany in 1932 and later the influence of this ideology spread to the countries of Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and France
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke bich fasivadi vichaaron kaa hraas tathaa samaajawaadee vichaaron or andolanon kii pragati hui he
 In addition to the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, for some time in Western Europe, several countries formed joint regimes in collaboration with socialist and communist parties
 europe ke kuch anya deshon jaise tathaa austrailia or newjiland aadi deshon main samay samay par samaajawaadee sarkarein banati rahi hai
 In this period, countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have also established socialist rule
 inamen china, burma, hind asia, singapore, ghana or cuba mukhya hai

 Phenol is virtually the name of a class of organic compounds whose first member is 'phenol' or carbolic acid
 benzene cendrak kaa ek yaa ek se adhik hydrogen jab hydroxil samooh se visthapit hota he, tab usase jo utpaada praapt hote hai use phenol kehete hai
 If there is only one hydroxyl in the nucleus, it is called monohy- dric phenol, two hydroxyls, it is dihydric phenol and three hydroxyls, it is called trihydric phenol
 monohidrik phenol koyale or kaath ke shushk aswan se banate hai
 By this method, the carbolic acid of trade is obtained
 carbolak amla kaa avishkaar pehle-pehle ruunge dwaara 1834 i
 main hua tha
 In 1840, Loren discovered its presence in Alaktare
 iskaa phenol naam xeraar dwaara 1843 i
 main diya gaya tha
 In 1867, phenol benzene was first prepared by Wurtus and Keucule
 phenol taiyaar karne kii anek vidhiyaan maaloom hai, par aaj phenol kaa vyapaarik nirmaan alakatre yaa benzene se hota he
 The fraction from the Prabhaji distillation of Alaktare is 170 ° c to 230 ° C
 But distilled is called middle oil or carbolic oil
 saamaanya phenol isi main napathlin ke saath mila hua rahata he
 Treated with dilute solution of caustic base, the phenol dissolves in the solution and the naphthalene remains insoluble
 vilyan ke gandhakaml yaa carbon dioxide dwaara vighatit karne se phenol avakshipt hokar jal se pruthak ho jaataa he
 Pure carbolic acid is white, crystalline, informative, solid, but by being stored in air, it absorbs water to form a liquid, whose color first turns black behind pink
 iske crystal 430 degree sein
