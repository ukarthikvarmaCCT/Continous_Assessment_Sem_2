 veg adhik hone se, ghoomanevaale chaalkon par apkentre bal bahut adhik ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran armechar par unki vyavastha bhang ho ja sakati he
 Hence, they are placed in the pillars on the armature
 armechar chaalkon ko dhaaran karne ke saath hi unako ghumata bhi he, jiske liye uskaa shaft yantric urja kaa sambharan karanevaale yantra ke shaft se yugmit hota he
 This device can be a water turbine, or a steam turbine or engine
 kisi bhi rup main uplabdh yantric urja ko armechar kaa shaft ghumaane ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus various types of instruments are used to drive the generator
 inhen pradhan chaalak kehete hai
 Various types of engines, such as steam engines, diesel engines, petrol engines, gas turbines, etc
 machines, are used as prime drivers and their mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy by generation 
 armechar chumbakeey padaarth kaa bana hota he, jisase chumbakeey kshetra ke abhivah kaa vaahak ho sake
 Generally, it is made of a special type of steel, which is called armature steel
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karne ke liye bhi vidyut kaa hi prayog vyaavhaarik rup main kiya jaataa he, kyonki isse sthaayee chumbak kii apeksha kahin adhik tivrata kaa chumbakeey kshetra utpann kiya ja saktaa he or kshetradhara kaa vicharan kar sugamawa se kshetra kaa vicharan kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus the voltage generated can be easily controlled
 chumbakeey kshetra utpann karne ke liye kshetra chumbak hote hai, jinpar kshetrakundali vartit hoti he
 The magnetic field is produced by the flow of current in these coils
 ekasam kshetra ke liye kshetra chumbakon kaa aakaar kuch golai liye hota he or unke bich main armechar ghumta he
 The air gap between the armature and the field magnets must be minimal, so that most of the armature of the field current can cut off the conductors and maximize the voltage generated in the armature
 kshetra kundali main dhara pravaah ko uttejan kehete hai
 This stimulation can be done by connecting to an external source, or a part of the current generated in the same generator itself can also be used for stimulation
 bahari strot se uttejit kiye janevaale janitr ko bahya uttejit janitr kaha jaataa he or swayan usee janitr main janit dhara kaa bhaag upyog karanevaale janitr ko swat:uttejit janitr kaha jaataa he
 The systems of automatic stimulation also vary according to the combination of field coil and armature
 yadi kshetra kundali armechar se shrenee main sanyojit hon, to use shrenee janitr kaha jaataa he
 If both have lateral connections, it is called a shunt generator
 yadi kshetra kundali ke kuch vart armechar se shrenee main or kuch usase parshv sambandhit hon, to aise janitr ko sanyukt janitr kehete hai
 These different methods of stimulation provide different symptoms
 bahya uttejit janitr main kshetradhara armechar dhara athwa bhardhaara par nirbhar nahin karti
 Hence the voltage generated in it is independent of load variance
 yadi kshetradhara ko ek samaan rakhaa jaae or janitr main janit voltata bhi ek samaan rahegi
 The shunt generator also has almost the same characteristics and the effect of load variance is not much on the voltage generated
 shrenee janitr main, bhardhaara hi armechar or kshetra kundaliyon main pravaahit hoti he
 Hence, this field depends on the stream load and thus the generated voltage increases with increasing load
 sanyukt janitr main shant evam shrenee janitron ke bich ke lakshan hote hai
 By arranging the shunt and range curves of the field horoscope, any characteristics between them can be obtained
 vyavhaar main sanyukt janitron kaa hi adhik prayog hota he
 The voltage generated in a conductor moving at the same velocity in the magnetic field depends on the speed of cutting the magnetic flow of the conductor
 yah gati, vastut:, kisi kshan bhi chaalak ke chumbakeey abhivah ke saapeksh sthit par nirbhar karti he
 When the driver is moving at the same speed, he will be perpendicular to the transport twice in one round and in this case he will cut the maximum load, and when he does not cut any transport, will be parallel to it twice
 is prakaar ek chakkar main do baar usamen janit voltata shunya or adhiktam ke bich vicharan karegi, jaisi chitra 3
 main dikhaaya gaya he
 This type of variance is called recursive variance
 armechar chaalkon main bhi isi prakaar kii prayavarti voltata janit hoti he or use disht rup dene ke liye dikparivartak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The transformer is mounted on the shaft of the armature
 usamen bahut se tamrakhand hote hai, jo ek duusare se vidyutruddh hote hai
 The interconnections of the armature are connected to these segments
 dikparivartak se sansparsh karanevaale do burush hote hai, jo armechar main janit voltata dwaara pravaahit honevaali dhara ko bahari paripath se sanyojit karte hai
 The armature drivers are connected to the transformer in such a way that the current collected by the two bursts is in the same direction
 is prakaar ek burush dhanatmak dhara ikatthi karata he or doosraa rinatmak
 On this basis, Burushas are also called positive and negative
 vastut:, burush vidyutdhara ke terminal hai, jo bhaar ko janitr se sambhddha karte hai
 These are attributed to the Burushholder and their position on the diabolical can be administered by the Burush holder
 suheldev superfast express anand vihaar terminal railway stesan se gajipur city uttari railway se judi ek superfast train he jo ki bharat main gajipur shahar or anand vihaar terminal ke bich chalati he
 It is currently operated with four days on a week basis with 22419 / 22420 train numbers
 
 The train is named after Suheldev, a fictional king of Shravasti

 ek brahman kumaar ghar se nikal karke tapasya karne ke liye chal detaa he
 One day a bird made her sit on the fly
 beeth uske upar gira to usne use dekha to chida bhasma ho kar neeche gir gaya
 He thought, now the matter is made, austerity has brought color
 vahaan se usne nishchay kar liya ki ab siddhi mil gai
 He went to a colony and going to a house he used the voice of 'narayan Hari' for alms
 ek maan ne andar se awaz di - thahrie maharaj! abhi aa rahi hoon
 Stopped for a while, then sounded - 'bhikshan Dehi
 ’ maan ne awaz di, maharaj! thahrie - main abhi aa rahi hoon
 Stopped for a while, then made a sound
 devi ne phir awaz di, bhagwan! main aapse nivedan kar rahi hoon, thahrie! main abhi aa rahi hoon
 He was addicted to his penance
 vah kehane laga tumhen pataa nahin, main koun hoon, meri avhelnaa kar rahi he tu? andar se vah devi boli, mujhe pataa he lekin aap yah na samajhnaa ki main vah chida hoon jisko aap dekhenge or vah jal jayega
 i am not that irritated, remember, stand there, i am coming now
 ab uskaa tapasya kaa nasha utar gaya
 He came to mind that how he came to know sitting at home that i had become irritated in the forest
 thodi der baad vah bhiksha lekar ai
 The Brahmin asked - Goddess! We need alms later, first tell us how you came to know that i consumed the bird
 usne kaha, mere paas itnaa samay nahin he ki aapako bataaun
 Take your begging and if you want to know about it, then go to some city, there live a Vaishya there, he will tell you
 vahaan se vah sudarshan naam kaa brahman chalaa
 In the city he went to the Vaishya, he was engaged in his business
 usne dekha or kaha aaie! pandit ji! baith jaaie! vah baith gaya
 After a while the Brahmin started saying, i want to ask you something
 vaisya ne kaha, ji haan - aapako us stri ne mere paas bheja he kyonki aapane dekhakar chida jala diya he
 Now i do not have time, if necessary, then you go away from here
 amuk nagar main ek vyaadh rahata he, vah aapako sari baat samajha degaa
 If you want to understand from me, you will have to wait till evening
 brahman ko to jaldi thi, vah kahata he acha! main usee ke yahan chalaa jaataa hoon
 When he went to the hunter, he was selling meat by chopping it
 vyaadh bolaa - aaie pandit ji! baithiye! aapako sethji ne bheja he
 Never mind, please
 abhi main apana kaam kar rahaa hoon, baad main aapse baat karunga
 The Brahmin was very surprised
 ab baith gaya vahiin, sochane laga ab kahin nahin janaa, yaheen nirnay ho jayega
 When evening was over, the hunter closed his shop, took Panditji and walked towards his house
 brahman vyaadh se poochne laga ki aap kis dev kii upasna karte hai jo aapako itnaa bodh he
 He said, "come on, i am showing you that god
" pandit ji badi utsukata ke saath uske ghar pahunche to dekha vyaadh ke vruddh mata or pita ek panlag par baithe hue the
 The hunter bowed to him as soon as he left
 unke charan dhoe, unki seva kii or bhojan karaayaa
 When the priest started saying something, the hunter said - you sit, first i should worship my gods, then i will talk to you
 pehle matrudevo bhav phir pitru devo bhav or acharya devo bhav tab atithi devo bhav, aapkaa to chauthaa nambar he bhagwan! ab vah brahman vichaar karne laga ki yah to shaastra kaa gyaata he
 When the Brahmin asked why did you do such a bad deed by being such a big philosopher, he said - God! Karma is not inferior

 Eric Erickson was an American development psychologist and psychoanalyst who was born in Germany
 ve apane manosamaajik vikaas siddhanth ke liye jane jate hai
 Was born on 15 June 1902 and was a german-american development psychologist and psychoanalyst known for his theory on the psychosocial development of humans
 unhone vaakyansh pahchaan ke sankat ko naam dene ke liye sabase prasiddh saktaa he
 His son, Kai
 T
 Erickson, a noted American sociologist
 haalanki arikson bhi ek snaatak kii degree kami rah gai thi, vah is tarah ke harvard or yel ke rup main pramukh sansthaanon main professor ke rup main kaary kiya
 The General Psychology Survey Review, published in 2002, ranked Ericsson as the 12th most cited psychiatrist of the 20th century
 arikson kii maa karla ebreehmsan, copenhegan, denmark main ek pramukh yahudee parivaar se aayaa he
 She was married to Jewish stockbroker Valdemar Isidore Salomonsen, but was estranged from her for several months in the time Eric had imagined
 little sivaay iske ki vah denmark ke ek naastik vyakti tha erik ke jaivik pita ke bare main janaa jaataa he
 Upon the discovery of her pregnancy, Carla fled to Frankfurt, Germany, where Eric was born on June 15, 1902 and was given the surname Salomonsen
 pahchaan ke vikaas ke liye apane swayan ke jivan main ke rup main acchhee tarah se apane siddhant main arikson kii sabase badi chintaaon main se ek rahaa he lagata he
 As an older adult, he wrote about his teenage "identity confusion" in his European days
 "meri pahchaan bhram," unhone likhaa tha par samay par tha, "neurosis or kishor maansikta ke bich kii seemaa rekha
 "erickson's daughter writes that her father's" true psycho identity "was not established until she replaced her stepfather's surname with the name of" his own invention
 " prayek charan ke anukool parinaam kabhi kabhi "gun," arikson ke kaam ke sandarbh main prayukt shabd ke rup main janaa jaataa he ke rup main yah chikitsa ke liye lagu kiya jaataa he, jiskaa arth he 'shakti
 "ericsson's research suggests that each person must learn how to hold both extremes of each specific life-stage challenge under stress with each other, not dismissing one end of stress or the other
 keval jab ek jivan-charan chunauti main donon charam simaaon ko samajha or sweekaar kiye jate hai donon ke rup main aavashyak or upyogi he, kar sakate hai ki manch kii sataha ke liye ishtatam punya
 Thus, both 'faith' and 'wrong belief' must be understood and realistic 'hope' must be accepted in order to emerge as a viable solution in the first stage
 isi tarah, 'eemaandaaree' or 'niraashaa' donon ko samajha or karrwai 'gyaan' aakhri charan main ek vyavhaarya samaadhaan ke rup main ubharne ke liye aadesh main gale laga liya, kiya janaa chahie
 Ericsson life stage virtues, in the order of the eight stages in which they can be achieved, are: 1) aashaa, buniyadi trust banaam buniyadi avishvaas-is charan main bachapan kii avadhi, umr ke 0-1 varsh he, jo jivan kaa sabase moulik charan main he shaamil hai
 Whether the child develops basic belief or mistrust basic is not only a matter of nutrition
 yah bahuaiami he or majboot saamaajik ghatak hai
 2) Will, 1–3 years shame-cover around autonomy vs
 childhood
 swaittata banaam shame kii baat he or shaq kii avadharana kaa parichay
 The child begins to discover the beginning of his or her freedom, and should facilitate the child's sense of the parent doing the basic work "all himself / herself
" " 3) Purpose, initiative vs
 crime-preschool / 3-6 years
 bachche kii kshamta he yaa is tarah use yaa khud poshaak ke rup main apane dam par baaten karte hai, he naa? agar "doshi" apane yaa apane vikalp banane ke bare main, bachche ko acchhee tarah se kaary nahin karenge
 4) Efficiency, industry vs
 inferiority-school age / 6–11 years
 bal swayan ke laayak dusron kii tulana main
 Children may recognize major disparities in personal abilities relative to other children
 5) fidelity, pahchaan banaam bhoomika bhram kishor / 12-18 saal
 Raised a question of its own
 main koun hoon, main kaise main feet ho? kahan main jivan main ja rahaa hoon? arikson kaa maananaa he ki agar mata pita bachche kaa pataa lagane ke liye anumati dete hai, ve unki khud kii pahchaan samaapt hoga
 6) Love, intimacy vs
 isolation - this is the first stage of adult development
 is vikaas aamtaur par yuva vayaskta, jo 18 35
 dating karne kii umr ke bich he ke dauraan hota he, vivaah, parivaar or dosti ko apane jivan main charan ke dauraan mahatvapurn hai
 By successfully forming love relationships with other people, individuals are able to experience love and intimacy
 jo log asafal sthaayee sambandhon se alag-thalag mahasoos karte hai or akele may ke liye farm
 7) Care occurs between age 35–64 in the second stage of adulthood vs
 stagnation-adulthood
 is samay ke dauraan logon ko saamaanya rup se unke jivan main based hai or jaanate hai ki kya unke liye mahatvapurn he kar rahe hai
 8) Wisdom, ego integrity vs
 frustration - affects the age group of 65 and up in this phase
 is samay ke dauraan ek vyakti ko apane jivan main antim adhyay tak pahunch gaya he or sevanivritti ke kareeb pahunch rahaa he yaa pehle se hi jagah le lee he
 Deforestation means burning or cutting trees in areas of forests for several reasons; Trees and charcoal derived from them can be sold as a commodity and used by humans, while cleared land can be used as pasture or human habitat
 pedon ko is prakaar se kaatane or unhen punah na lagane ke parinaam swarup awaas ko kshati pahunchi he, jaev vividhta ko nuksaan pahunchaa he or vaataavaran main shushkta bad gayi he
 Also, the areas from which trees are removed often turn into wastelands

 In many countries deforestation is sustained, resulting in processes such as deletion, climate change, desertification and displacement of indigenous people
 saadhaaran shabdon main, vanonmulan isliye hoti he kyon ki van bhoomi aarthik rup se vyavhaarya nahin he
 Along with increasing the amount of land for farming, wood is used by more than 200 million people all over the world
 ek anuvanshik sansaadhan ke rup main wanon kii anumaanit mulya kii pushti kisi bhi aarthik adhyayan ke dwaara nahin kii gayi he
 As a result, the owners of forest land suffer from not cleaning the forests and this affects the welfare of the whole society

 As a result of which some countries have a lot of forest, the developing countries feel that some countries in the developed world, such as the United States, cut their forests centuries ago and have benefited a lot from it and have equal opportunities for developing countries
 It would be wrong to refute
 yani garib log apane sangrakshan kii laagat kaa bhi vahan nahin kar sakate hai, jabaki amiron ne is samasya ko paidaa kiya
 Apart from a general agreement that deforestation increases the economic value of land, there is no agreement as to what causes deforestation
 kuch kshetron main lakdi ke liye vanonmulan iskaa sidhaa strot ho saktaa he or kuch kshetron main yah apratyaksh strot ho saktaa he jaise jo kisaan jangalon kii safai ke liye janaa chaahate hai, unke liye sadak hetu vanonmulan: visheshgy is baat se sahamat nahin hai ki lakdi ke liye pedon kaa kaata janaa vishwastareey vanonmulan main mahatvapurn yogadan detaa he
 And some believe that cutting wood contributes to the reduction of deforestation as wood reserves in developing countries have far more than natural sources
 isi prakaar vahaan par is baat par sahamati nahin he ki garibi vanonmulan main mahatvapurn he
 Some argue that poor people prefer cutting wood because they have no other option
 anya logon kaa maananaa he ki garib logon ke paas jangalon kii safai ke liye aavashyak padaarth or shram ke liye keemat chukaane kii kshamta nahin hoti he
 Population growth promotes deforestation, such claims are weak and based on erroneous data, with population growth primarily increasing deforestation occurring in only 8 percent of cases

 According to the UK environmentalist Norman Myers, 5 percent of deforestation is caused by animal grazing, 19 percent is due to deforestation, 22 percent is due to plantation for growing palm oil and 54 percent is caused by plantation
 Slash and burn type farming
 vanonmulan kii dar ke aankade praapt karnaa, agar naammumkin nahin to bahut mushkil he
eggeo aankde bade paimaane par alag alag deshon ke van nibhaagon kii reporton par aadhaarit hote hai
 The World Bank estimates that 80 percent of deforestation in Bolivia and 42 percent of cases in Colombia are illegal, while illegal harvesting in Peru amounts to 80 percent of all actions
 ushnkaribandheey deshon ke liye, vanonmulan kaa anumaan bahut anishchit he: upgrah chitron ke anusaar katibandhon main vanonmulan kii dar sabase adhik uddhrut dar se 23 pratishat kam he
 And the absolute rates of deforestation can be up to + / - 50% for abstinence

 The UNFAO has the best long-term data on deforestation available and based on these data, global forest cover has remained almost constant since the middle of the twentieth century
 ) or sabase lambe uplabdh aankadon ke aadhaar par vaishvik jangal cover 1954 se bad gaya he
 The rate of deforestation is also decreasing
 har sadi main wanon kii safai kii dar main kami aati ja rahi he
 The rate of deforestation globally decreased during the 1980s, decreased sharply in 1990
 It decreased even more from 2000 to 2005
 Based on these trends, it is expected that anti-global deforestation efforts Global forest cover will increase by 10 percent by 2050 - equal to the size of India's area, along with reducing deforestation in the next half century
 vikasshil ushnkaribandheey rashtron main vanonmulan ki daren ucchtam hai, yadhyapi 
1990 main lagbhag 8
6 million hectare vaarshik ushn katibandheey vanonmulan kii dar ke saath vishwa str par ushnkaribandheey wanon kii kshati kii dar bhi kam ho rahi he, jabaki pichhali sadi main 9
2 million hectare kii kshati bhi hui he
 The utility of FAO data is disputed by some environmental groups
 ye sawaal praathmik rup se uthaaye jate hai, kyon kii aankde wanon ke prakaar ke bich vibhedan nahin karte hai
 The fear is that deforestation will increase in highly diverse habitats, such as tropical rainforests, which are experiencing major reductions in the types of less biodiverse arid, open forests
 is kami ke kaaran yah sambhav he ki vanonmulan ke kai nakaaratmak prabhaav jaise awaas main kami, vanonmulan main kami ke baavjood bad rahe hai
 Some environmentalists predict that if the world-class supreme importance is not taken for the protection of old forests, by 2030 only 10 percent of it will remain
 And the remaining 10 percent will also be on the verge of ending
 80 pratishat khatm ho chukaa hoga
 And with that, hundreds of thousands of species will also be extinct, whose compensation will be impossible
 pichley 30 saalon ke dauraan vanonmulan main kami aane ke baavjood vanan kii kataai ek gambhir vishwastareey paryaavarni samasya bani hui he or kai kshetron main yah ek saamaajik or aarthik samasya bani hui he
 13 million hectares are lost every year, of which 6 million hectares are forests that have not been extensively damaged by humans
 iske parinaam swarup vanya jivan ke liye awaas main kami aati he or saath hi in wanon ke dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi paristhitik tantra sevaao main bhi kami aati he
 The decline in the rate of deforestation does not compensate for the loss already caused by deforestation
 vishwa str par vanonmulan 1800 ke madhya main teji se badi, or 1947 tak paripakv ushnkaribandheey van kaa mul 15 million se 16 million varg kilometre kaa lagbhag aadha yani 7
5 se 8 million varg kilometre kshetra saafe kiya ja chukaa tha
 The rate of deforestation varies widely by region
 kuch kshetron main vaishvik kami ke baavjood, vishesh rup se vikaas sheel ushn katibandheey rashtron main, vanonmulan kii dar bad rahi he
 For example, Nigeria lost 81% of its old forests in just 15 years
 puraa africa vishwa se doguni dar par vanonmulan se peedit he
 The effects of deforestation are most pronounced in tropical rainforests
 brazil apane mata atlantika wanon kaa 90-95 pratishat kho chukaa he
 Two-thirds of the lowland tropical forests in Central America have been converted into pastures since 1950
 rondonia ke brazili rajya kaa aadha 243,000 kimi 2 haal hi ke varshon main vanonmulan se prabhavit hua he
 And tropical countries including Mexico, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka, Laos, Nigeria, Congo, Liberia, Guinea, Ghana and Côte d'ivoire have lost large areas of their rain forests
 Is, because these rates vary across regions, and the global reduction in deforestation rates does not necessarily imply that negation of deforestation Effect also decreases
 siberia ke bade kshetron ko soviet sangh ke patan ke baad se sinchaa gaya he
 In the last two decades, Afghanistan has lost more than 70 percent of its forests throughout the country

 Tropical deforestation is responsible for 20 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions
 jalwaayu parivartan par intergarvamental panel ke anusaar, mukhya rup se ushn katibandheey kshetron main, vanonmulan kul anthrotpogenic carbon dioxide utsarjan ke ek tihaai ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Trees and other plants remove carbon from the atmosphere as carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis
 or saamaanya shwasan kii prakriya ke dauraan ise phir se vayumandal main chhod dete hai
 Only during active growth can a tree or forest remove carbon for a year or longer period
 apghaton yaa lakdi ke jalane se yah sanchit carbon vayumandal main laut jaataa he
 In order for the forest to take carbon, the wood should be converted into long-lived products and trees should be grown again
 vanonmulan ke kaaran carbon mitti main mukt hokar sanchit ho jaati he
 Forests are carbon reserves and may either decrease or the source may depend on atmospheric conditions

 Common people believe that world rain forests play a major role in the amount of oxygen in the world, although scientists have now accepted that rain forests contribute very little pure oxygen to the atmosphere
 or vanonmulan kaa vayumandal main oxigen ke str par koi prabhaav nahin padataa he
 However, incineration and burning of forests to clear the land produces several tons of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming
 van vaayu main se carbon dioxide or pradooshkon ko nishkarshith karne main samarth hote hai
 And thus contribute to maintaining the stability of the biosphere
 jal chakra bhi vanonmulan se prabhavit hota he
 Trees absorb groundwater through their roots and release them into the atmosphere
 jab jangal kaa ek hissaa nikaal diya jaataa he to ped is pani ko vashpikrut nahin karte or iske parinaam swarup vaataavaran shushk ho jaataa he
 Deforestation reduces the amount of water in the soil, the amount of ground water and the amount of moisture in the atmosphere
 vanonmulan mitti kii sansanjan kshamta main kami laati he jisase apradan, baadh or bhuskhalan nishchit ho jate hai van kuch sthanon main equyfaire ke punraveshan ko badhaava dete hai, haalaanki, adhikansh sthanon main van hi equyfaire main kami kaa mukhya strot hai
 Reduction in forests covers the ability of shrinkage and land scape to maintain evaporation of precipitation

 This rapid flow of surface water can be the cause of flash floods and thus increase the chances of flooding in forested areas

 The most interesting question related to an internal informant is why and under what circumstances people stop illegal work immediately and otherwise report it by rejecting such behavior

 yah sambhav he ki kai log pratishodh lene kii bhaavana se hi nahin balki bahari or kaam par rishton ko khone kii vajah se darkar bhi mukhabiri se dur rahete hai
 Because most cases are of low grade and usually receive little or no media attention and the informant's important job is to report abuse, which is a kind of danger and usually one of glory and fame
 The perception of demand is very low

 hastlekhvigyaan ke antargat hastlekh kaa vaigyanik pareekshan aata he, jiskaa mukhya uddeshy yah nishchit karnaa hota he ki koi lekh vyaktivishesh kaa likhaa hua he yaa nahin
 Writing is an acquired asset, which human beings derive from practice
 lekhak kii manovriti tathaa uski mansapeshiyon ke sahyog ke anusaar uske lekh main visheshtaayen utpann ho jaati hai
 Due to these characteristics, each person's article is different from the other person's article
 jis prakaar ham kisi manushya kii pahchaan uske saamaanya tathaa vishisht lakshanon ko dekhakar kar sakate hai usee prakaar kisi lekh ke saamaanya tathaa vishisht lakshanon kii tulana karke ham use pahchaan sakate hai
 Human color, form, height, etc

 are characteristic
 isi prakaar lekh kii gati, uske pravaah kii abadhata, uskaa jhukaav, kaushal tathaa hashia, panktiyon kii sighai aadi uske saamaanya lakshan hai or aksharon ke vibhinn aakaar vishisht hai
 By matching these two types of characteristics of the two articles, the expert comes to the conclusion that the person writing them is the same person or not
 vishisht lakshan, jinako ham vyaktigat visheshtaayen bhi kah sakate hai, do prakaar ke hote hai - pratyaksh tathaa apratyakh
 Direct attributes are manifest features that are uniquely different from normal writing systems, such that some people make characters specific to a specific shape by not making them common
 'apratyaksh visheshta' vyaktivishesh ke lekh main pun: pun: milanevaali us visheshta ko kahenge jisaki ore saamanyatya dhyaan nahin jaataa he
 Because they often do not have the attention of the writer who spoils their article in order to hide it, nor is the attention of the scammer who wants to copy another's article, so they become of special importance in identifying the article
 is
 hastlekhvigyaan ke antargat lekhan saamagree tathaa prakshipt, arthath baad main badaye gaye, lekhon kaa pareekshan bhi aata he, kyonki inase bhi lekh sambandhi prashnon ko hal karne main sahaayta milti he
 Nowadays, this controversy often arises in court about whose person is written
 aisi tathaa anya tatsadrush paristhitiyon main hastlekh visheshgy kii vishesh aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Generally, no other person's opinion is admissible in the court
 kintu aisi paristhiti main hastlekh visheshgy kii raay bharat sakshya adhinium kii dhara 45 ke adheen grahya hoti he or uskaa vishesh mahatv bhi hota he
 Under the said section, opinion of those persons who are familiar with the article of that person can also be sought and call themselves competent to identify it
 hastlekh visheshgy pehle bhi hote the, visheshtya videshon main
 He often gave his opinion by looking at the structure of the letters, which had no scientific basis and there was ample opportunity for error

 ise "avogadro kii pariklpana" evam "avogadro kaa siddhanth" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 In 1811, Avogadro presented this hypothesis, which is as follows - san 1811 i
 main italy ke rasayanajna aavogadro ne anu or parmaanu main bhed spasht karte hue bataaya ki parmaanu kisi tatv kaa vah sookshmatam kan he jo rasinic kriya main bhaag letaa he or iskaa swatantra astitv ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 a molecule is the smallest particle of matter that has all the properties of the substance and its independent existence is possible
 aavogadro ne hi sarvapratham kaha ki gaison main keval anuon kaa swatantra astitv sambhav he na ki parmaanuon kaa, isiilie gas ke aaytan ko usamen upasthit anuon se vyakt karnaa chahie
 On this basis Avogadro has expressed the following relationship: prarambh main is sambandh ko aavogadro kii pariklpana kaha gaya tha lekin baad main jab prayogon dwaara iskaa pareekshan kiya gaya to ise aavogadro kaa siddhant kaha jane laga
 And now it is called 'law of Avogadro'
 parmaanu siddhant ke sanshodhan main tathaa gelusa ke niyam kii vyakhya karne main is niyam kaa uyapyog hua he
 This rule is used in deriving atomicity of elemental gases, in determining the molecular weight, in relation to the mass volume of gases, and in the analysis of gases
 aavogadro kii sankhya-kisi bhi gas ke ek gram anu bhaar main anuon kii sankhya samaan hoti he
 This number is called Avogadro's number
 vibhinn vidhiyon se iskaa maan 6
02x1023 nishchit kiya gaya he
 Avogadro's number is one of the five world constants
 ise roman akshar en se nirupit karte hai
 The same volume of hydrogen and nitrogen will have the same number of molecules if they are kept at the same temperature and pressure and are behaving like ideal gas
 vyavhaar main vaastavik gaison ke liye yah niyam purnat: satya nahin he balki "lagbhag satya" he
 Where: avogadro ke niyam kaa sabase mahatvapurn nishkarsh yah he ki adarsh gas niyatank kaa maan sabhi gaison ke liye samaan hota he
 Ie kaa maan sabhi gaison ke liye samaan he, chaahe unke anon kaa aakaar athwa dravyaman kuch bhi ho
 here: kisi adarsh gas kaa ek mol maanak taap va daab par 22
4 litre sthaan gherta he
 This volume is often called the molar volume of an ideal gas
