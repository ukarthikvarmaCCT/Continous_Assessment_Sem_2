 hakhaamani vansh yaa ajamidh samrajya pracheen iran kaa ek shaasha vansh tha
 It was the first ruling dynasty in the known history of ancient Iran to have acquired sovereignty over almost the whole of present-day Iran and moreover, during its peak it ran from Greece in the west to the Indus River in the east and from the Caspian Sea in the north to the south
 Had spread to the Arabian Sea
 itnaa bada samrajya iske baad bas saasaani shaasha hi sthapit kar paae the
 The decline of this dynasty occurred in AD 330 BC after the invasion of Alexander, after which Greek dominion was established over its territories

 Its area was around modern Haryana
 isaki rajdhani sambhawatah hastinapur yaa indraprastha thi
 The extent of the expansion of the kingdom of Kuru must have been a matter of discovery for Indians, but in world history, Kuru was the Chakravarti king who gave new dimensions to the largest empire of the ancient world, while transferring the Med empire in Iran from his own maternal grandfather Astyagus
 The empire was renamed Ajmeedh Achaemenid_empire empire

 When Kuru became hereditary king of Anshan in 559 BCE, he refused to accept the Mead dominance and revolted against the Mead empire
 usne isapurv 549 main maid raja astyagas kii rajdhani hamaadaan par adhikaar kar liya
 He declared himself the King of Paras and made the Mead Empire his ally

 usne pashchim kii disha main ledia par adhikaar kar liya
 There he also looted the wealth of the famous Croesus for his treasures
 iske alaava asia miner ke ilaakon par or babylonia par bhi usne adhikaar kar liya
 Kurosh gave religious freedom to the Jews
 lekin kuru kii mrityu uske jivan itani garimamayi nahin rahi
 In the latter part of his life, when he returned from the western side of the Caspian Sea and set out for a victory expedition, he was defeated and killed by the queen of Messagete there
 lekin us samay tak kurosh ne ek vishaal samrajya khadaa kar diya tha
 From the Greek cities to the Caspian Sea in the Middle East and along the coast of Turkey, hardly anyone in the world has stood up to that time

 An inscription found near Bisitun in western Iran states that a Magi named Gaumata revolted
 usne apane ko kambojia kaa chota bhai bataakar farsi janata par pade karon ke khilaaf logon ko bhadakaayaa tha
 It was true that during the time of Kurosh and Kambojia, the Iranian people had fought a lot of battles and the expenditure came from taxes imposed on the people
 par iske kuch hi dinon baat daara ne gaumata ko maar diya or shah ban baitha
 He later inscribed the events of those days in Bisitun

 With this intention, he launched an attack on the coastal regions of Anatolia

 Now Alexander entered Turkey directly
 isapurv san 330 main usne daara tritiy ko ek yuddh main haraa diya
 But the kingdom of Dara had become very large by that time and Alexander's victory with a defeat cannot be assured
 par sikandar ne daara ko teen alag alag yudhon main haraaya
 Dara fled the battlefield and the Yavans took control of the Persian army
 iske baad sikandar ne daara ko pakadaney kii koshish kii par iskaa use sidhaa phayda nahin mila
 a few days later Alexander's body was found by Alexander
 daara ko uske hi aadamiyon ne maar diya tha
 With this the Hakhamani empire collapsed

 jeevashmiki yaa jeevashm vigyaan yaa palantology, bhoumiki kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh bhoumikeey yugon ke un praaniyon or padpon ke avasheshon se he jo ab bhuparpati ke shailon main hi paae jate hai
 Tweb Hoeffel and Auck, giving a definition of fossilism, wrote: Paleontology is the science that explains the life of past geological ages revealed by the primitive plants and the putrid remains of animals
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki jeevashm vigyaan adikalin jeevajantuon kaa, une ashmibhoot avasheshon ke aadhaar par adhyayan karata he
 The word fossil itself indicates that there is a study of Jiva + Ashram
 angreji kaa Palaentology shabd bhi Palaios = pracheen + Onto = jeev ke adhyayan kaa nirdesh karata he
 The study of paleontology is a new branch of biology and it has developed over the last 200 years
 vigyaan kii is shakha ke vikaas ke bahut pehle se adimanav kii jaankaree main yah tha ki kuch prakaar ke shailon main ek vicitra prakaar ke avshesh paae jate hai jo samudri jeevon ke anuroop hote hai
 In the absence of knowledge, he first considered these relics as not having biological origin, but the contents of the humor of nature, which became due to some power inside the earth
 parantu shanai:-shanai: gyaan kii vruddhi ke saath saath manushya ko is disha main bhi apane vichaaron ko badalanaa padaa or usne yah pataa laga liya ki shailon main paae janevaale avasheshon ke praani kisi na kisi samay main jeevat jeev the or vah sthaan jahaan par ham aaj in jeevashmon ko pate hai bhoumikeey yugon main samudr ke garbh main tha
 By 1820, only 127 herbaceous flora and 2,100 animals were detected, which by 1840 had increased to 2,050 and 24,300 respectively

 It is not possible under human capacity that all the world's sources of fossils are discovered

 Third, the geographical shape of the world as it is seen today, was not there in those days

 Therefore, the knowledge that we may or may have gained from their vulgar samples is different, or will be
 ant main yah kabhi sambhav nahin he ki jitne bhi jeevajantu itihaas ke us andhkaar yug main upasthit the, un sabakaa ashmikaran ho hi gaya ho
 There are some conditions of vulgarization, due to which the dead bodies of the fauna are vulgarized
 sabhi jeevon kaa ashmikaran na to aavyashyak hi he, na hi sambhav he
 For this reason too, it is difficult to write a series history of the life of the primitive creatures
 ab tak jitne bhi jeevashmiya pramaan hamen praapt ho chuke hai, unke aadhaar par jeevon ke kramik vikaas par acha khaasaa prakaash padataa he
 The study of fossils gives us an idea of the organisms which are now either extinct, or their present form has changed enough
 jeevashm pracheen jeevon ke ve avshesh hai, jo shilakhandon yaa anya sthanon par pathar jaise ho gaye hai
 Some such remains of creatures have also been found, which are in their original form rather than preserved
 himsagariya kshetron main praapt maimathon tathaa anya jantuon ke mrit sharir rus tathaa england or america ke sangrahalayon main surakshit hai
 Fossils also resemble, in modular form, the shape of modern organisms
 jeevashm keval avsaadee shilakhandon main hi mila karte hai
 After the death of many types of animals, the depression that accumulates on their dead bodies after death, they become fossils only over time
 kuch jeevashm to itane purna hai ki unki anvikshikeey pariksha karne par jeevon kii koshika tak kii rachanaayen spasht dikh padati hai
 It is not necessary to get obscene evidence of the living as its living body
 unke shavon main sadandh, oxikaran, hinsak jeevon dwaara vikrut kar dene, sheet, varsha, dhoop aadi ke kaaran vikaar utpann ho jaataa he
 Some animals, whose bodies are made up of inorganic materials such as calcium carbonate, silica, etc
, have relatively little effect on the disorder
 aise jeevon ke jeevashm bahut kam sankhya main uplabdh hai
 Even those that are available are incomplete to compare with modern living organisms
 jeevon kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi he ki ek prakaar ke jeevashm kuch vishesh prakaar ke shilakhandon main hi milte hai
 From these rocks, knowledge of the environment of the entire life of fossils is obtained
 jeevashmon se yah bhi maaloom hota he ki jeev kaise sthaan par rahaa karata tha or kya khaataa-peetaa tha
 They also throw light on the then geographical conditions

 Generally, the hard parts of the body of the animals - bones, teeth, shell etc
 - are restored

 Over time, they become so rigid that if the upper shell is broken, then an image-like replica goes inside

 These footprints do not only know the composition and shape of the soles of the feet of the animals, but also the direction of their movement

 Therefore, it is difficult to determine their antiquity with mineral-rich rocks

 Some fossils have been referred to as instructional fossils on the basis that they prove that certain animals or vegetation originated or may have occurred only in geological times
 aadim parivesh -jeevon ke jivan ke liye, chaahe ve vanaspatiyaan ho, chaahe jaanavar, vishesh prakaar ke bhugolic vaataavaran hi upyukt hote hai
 In other words, we can say that animals of a particular kind survive in a particular environment
 jeevashmon se pataa chalata he ki tatkaaleen jeev jantuon ke jeevanyaapan ke liye kis prakaar kaa bhugolic vaataavaran tha
 Fossils also give a glimpse of how these animals died or at what place at which stage
 iske saath hi pracheen bhoomi, sagar, jalashay aadi kii seemaa tathaa vistaar, jantuon or pakshiyon ke parvrajan aadi par bhi jeevashm prachur prakaash daalate hai
 The result of the study of these fossils is that the composition of ancient geographical maps can be simple and accessible

 Ancient Ecology - Living beings need a wide variety of environments to survive
 kuch jeev anya jeevon ke sharir ke upar yaa bheetar rahakar jeevanyaapan karte hai; inhen paraseete yaa parashrayi kehete hai
 Some organisms spend their lives in close contact with or engaging with other organisms

 Similarly, solutions to many other problems related to growth have been fossilized
 jeevashm vigyaan kai shakhaon main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 From the convenience point of view, it has now become a rule that when we use the word 'fossilology', we only mean the study of fossils of invertebrates
 jeevashmiki kii jis shakha ke antargat kasheruk jeevashmon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he use kasheruki jeevashm vigyaan kehete hai
 Plant fossils are studied under a different branch called phytosemiology
 aadhunik samay main jeevashmiki kii kuch anya pramukh shakhaon kaa bhi vikaas hua he, jinke adhyayan kaa kshetra kramash: ati laghu jeev or jeevashm maanav hai
 The field of paleontology is very wide and its limits cannot be determined definitively
 yadi saidhantik drushti se dekha jaae, to jeevashmiki kaa abhyuday prithvi par jeev ke pradurbhaav ke saath saath prarambh ho jaataa he, parantu bhoumikeey aadhaar par keval itnaa hi kaha saktaa he ki prithvi par sampurna jeev ke itihaas ke aadhe, yaa usase bhi kam ke, jeevon ke abhilekh hamen milte hai
 The beginning of fossil scientific investigations can be done from the oldest attainable fossils whose biological properties can be described on biological basis
 jeevashmiki kaa bhoumiki, visheshkar starit-shail-bhoumiki, se ati ghanishtha sambandh he
 Remnants of past living creatures are found in layered rocks
 in shailon ke nirmaan ke vishay main or unka anukram sthapit karne main unamem paae janevaale jeevashm bahut sahaayak siddh hue hai
 Actually layered-shell-geology without fossils is, in a way, practical paleontology
 jeevashmiki kaa jaiviki ke saath ghanishtha sambandh he
 Current biology and plants are studied under biology, while in biology, organisms and plants of geological ages that once lived and are now available only as fossils are studied
 lekin jeevashmiki ko jaiviki kii ek shakha nahin mana ja saktaa he, kyonki jeevashmiki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah kaa dhang jaiviki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah ke dhang se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Determining where fossilology can be separated from biology is often impossible
 parantu mote taur se jeevashm kaa ant or jaiviki kaa prarambh atyant-nutan yug or aadhunik yug ke sandhisthan se le sakate hai
 In this way, there are many and different types of fauna remains found between the indeterminate and suspicious pre-cambrian prehistoric animals and plants and between the present and certain types of organisms and plants, which throw light on the organism
 bhuparpati ke avsaadee shailon main milanevaale ye jeevashm hi, jeevashmiki ke adhyayan ke aadhaar hai
 Biologists are very interested in paleontology because it is closely related to a subject like biology
 praaniyon or padpon kii jatiyon kaa itihaas athwa jativrutt, starit shailon ke anukramit staron se praapt kiye jeevashmon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par adhik vishwaspurvak anurekhit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, due to incomplete record of organisms, the tracing of their genealogies is highly hindered, as only a few of the animals and plants found in the geological ages and most of them in incomplete condition are found reflected in these rocks
 abhilekh kii is apurnataa ke baavjood anek jeevavarg main, jab unka anurekhan shailon ke ek str se duusare str main kiya jaataa he tab, shanai: shanai: parivartan hone lagate hai
 When the patterns of fossils are collected from different indexed levels, the two distinctly visible species are directly related to the interstitial fossils and the fossils of intermediate levels ranging from the lowest found species to the highest
 Changes in the life of animals can be seen
 jeevashmon se jativrutt kaa pataa lagane ke liye, stareey reeti ke atirikt sharir tathaa vyativrutt kii tulanaatmak ritiyon kaa bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence, fossilism confirms the notion that biology developed as a result of changes occurring gradually
 is baat ke bataane kaa bhi pramaan he ki jeev vikaas niyatvikasiya tha
 This is to say that the biologic changes in the class of certain organisms occurred in a certain direction till ages and apart from this, the associated classes which are of the same ancestral origin, without being influenced by each other and external conditions, are similar in their evolution
 Stages or similar states, indicating that the direction of development in the various classes of organisms, By Vj is determined by paternal qualities
 jivit padpon or praaniyon kaa eckoshika andey se le karke antim dasha tak vikaas kii sampurna avasthaaon kaa anurekhan karnaa, bhraumiki or jeevaritti ke antargat aata he
 The evolution of the species of plants and animals of a class is almost the same, at least in its early stages, and the entire embryos within a class have so much homogeneity in one state until another that they cannot be separated
 is tathy ne un aakaaron main atyadhik bandhutav pragat kiya he, jo praudhavastha main ek duusare se atyadhik bhinn hote hai
 The reality of this is seen in vertebrates, whose embryos can be separated from each other with great difficulty in the initial stages and which very slowly bear the characteristic figures of their class or body
 in bhruneey anveshanon ke parinaamon kaa jeevashmiki ke saath vishesh sambandh he
 There are many fossils in the information that show signs of embryonic, or at least, fleshy, or adolescent, compared to modern organisms related to themselves
 isprakaar ke aadim awa bhruneey prakaaron ke udhaaharan kasherukon main vishesh karke dekhne ko milte hai, kyonki inamen kankal jivan ke ati praarambhik kaal hi main ashmibhoot ho jate hai
 Therefore, the late stages of modern organisms can be directly compared with adult fossils
 jeevashmon ko nishchit naam dena jeevashm vigyaani ke liye isliye mahatv kaa he ki jeevashmon main vah adhik yatharth vibhed kar sake
 The nomenclature of fossils is generally based on the same principles on which creatures
 pranijagat anek sanghon main vibhakt he or prayek sangh anek virgon, ganon, kulon, vanshon or jatiyon main vibhakt he
 There are many types of fossils
 yadi anveshak kisi jati ke jeevashm ke ek praturup ke aadhaar par us sampurna jati kaa varnan karata he, to vah jeevashm praturup us jati kaa naam praroop kehalaata he
 If the investigator takes the help of other fossil specimens to determine the name of one, these additional specimens are called paratypes
 yadi anveshak bina namprarup kaa nishchay kiye hi kai anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in jeevashm namoonon ko sahpraroop kehete hai
 If the fossil form of a caste is chosen after the initial description of that caste, then the fossil type is called the lectotype
 jis prakaar ek jati ke varnan ke liye jeevashm namoonay hote hai usee prakaar ek vansh ke varnan ke liye praroop jati athwa samajini jeevashm hote hai
 If an investigator describes a new lineage based on a particular race, then that caste becomes a genholotype for that lineage
 yadi anveshak nae vansh ke varnan main aisi jatiyon kii suchi de detaa he jinako vah yah samajhataa he ki ve nae vansh ke antargat aate hai, to in sab jatiyon ko jenocentip kehete hai
 Many of the genosyntypes can be sorted later by the ADI investigator or later by another investigator
 bhoumikeey kaal paanch brihat bhaagon main banta hua he
 These are respectively inamen orkiyozoik mahakalp sabase pracheen he
 The division of these five mahakalpas of the geological period is mainly based on the fossils of animals and plants found in these mahakalpas
 inamen se orkiyozoik mahakalp jeevashoonya tha
 There were no animals and plants of any kind in this great cycle
 at: is kaal ke shailon main hamako kisi bhi prakaar ke jeevashm nahin milte hai
 In Pragjivik Mahakalpa, very simple organisms like protozoa came into existence
 parantu in saadhaaran jeevon main kisi bhi prakaar ke kade bhaag ke abhaav ke kaaran ve shailon main parirakshit na ho sake
 Therefore, fossils are not found even in the rocks of Pragjivan Mahakalpa
 anya teenon mahakalp, arthath purajivi mahakalp madhyajivi mahakalp or nutanjivi mahakalp jeevashmamay hai
 All the divisions from small to large that come under these great concepts are based solely on the fossils of the organisms found in that period
 at: ham dekhte hai ki starit shailavigyaani kaa kaam bina jeevashm vigyaan kii sahaayta ke nahin chal saktaa
 This is why paleontology is called the backbone of layered rock science
 mote taur par jeevashm vigyaan ke adhaar par nimnlikhi chaar mukhya praani tathaa padap jaateey mahakalp sthapit kiye ja sakate hai : Former archaeological Mahakalpa - This includes Cambrian, Ordovision and Silurian kalpa
 uttar purajivi mahakalp - iske antargat deoni, carboni or parmian kalp aaten hai
 Intermediate survival nutanjeev mahakalp - abhinav kaal bhi iske antargat he
 Representative fossils of almost all major invertebrates are found in the Cambrian strata, and some of them, such as the trilobite, were more developed than they were in the Adicambrian period
 at: yah dhaaran ki cambrian staron main paae janevaale sab virgon ke purvaj cambrian purv kaal main paae jate the, bilkul uchit he, yadhyapi unke avshesh cambrian purv shailon main nahin milte
 It is conceivable that all kinds of beings lived in the pre-cambrian seas, but they were all Komalangi ancestors, who have not left any signs of their existence
 chunki sab prakaar ke praani pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh rup se paudhon par nirbhar rahete hai or paudhon main hi keval acarbonic khaadya padaarth ke paripachan kii shakti hoti he, at: yah bhi dharna uchit prathit hoti he ki cambrian purv kaal main paudhe astitv main the
 But it is surprising that the remains of plants have not been found in the levels of the archaeological Mahakalpa
 purvapurajivi mahakalp ke pranijagat ke mukhya lakshanon kaa sankshipt varnan is prakaar he : This was the era of Matsya and Parnaung similar plant plants, called Teridosperms
 inke saath goniotites, spiriferid bahupad or ryugos pravaal paae jate the
 The intergalactic Mahakalpa is called the kalpa of reptiles and ammonities
 inke saath belemnoities brackeopoda main rinkonilids or pravaalon kii bhi pradhanta thi
 This kalpa was the period of mammals, birds, foraminifers and angiosperms
 praani or padpon ke aadhaar par ham nutanjeev mahakalp ko aadhunik samay se pruthak nahin rakh sakate
 After the sequence of complete rocks was well established and the fossils found in them were identified, it was found that there was gradual progress in the development of organisms
 ati saadhaaran prakaar ke jeev sabase pehle prakat hue, jo sabase pracheen avsaadee shailon main paae jate hai or inke uparaant jatiltar jeev kramash: taruntar shailon main aate gaye
 Thus representatives of entire invertebrate associations, which are preserved in fossil form, are found in Cambrian rocks, but the organisms found under each association were often similar in their composition and showed very little change
 aakaareeya aadhaar par ham unhen alpaviksit vansh kah sakate hai, parantu baad ke yugon main paae janevaale sanghon me se prayek sangh main milanevaale jeevon kii rachana adhik bhinn thi or is tathy kii pushti kisi seemaa tak vanshon kii sankhya main vruddhi se ho jaati he
 The vertebrates are the Cyclosotomata class, considered primitive classes based on composition, which first emerged and were followed by fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, respectively, and these classes appeared in the same order as expected from their creation

 The study of the development of the horse is a good example for rendering biologic theory
 vah sampurna saamagree jis par ghode ke vikaas kaa itihaas aadhaarit he, uttari america ke tritiyak shailon se praapt kii gai he
 The main directions of its development are: aakaar main vruddhi, gati main vruddhi, sir or greeva main vruddhi
 The oldest fossil of the horse is the Eohypus, which has been found in the lower Eocene rocks and was in shape from cat to fox
 madhya iosin kaa ghoda orohipus ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo aakaar main iohipus se kuch hi bada tha
 Answer: The horse of the Eocene is called Ephippus, the subject of which is not fully known
 mesohipus ke naam se prachlit ghoda, nimnatar or madhya oligosin shailon main miltaa he
 It was equal to, or somewhat smaller than, a lamb in size
 myohipus, jo uttar oligosin or nimnatar myosin yug main paaya jaataa tha, bhed se kuch hi bade aakaar kaa tha
 Parahippus was very abundant in the lower Myocene age
 madhya myosin kaa ghoda, mericups kehalaata tha
 Which was similar to Parahippus itself
 plyosin yug kaa ghoda, plyohipus aakaar main gadhe ke baraabar tha, par tritiyak yug main milanevaala ghada vartmaan kaal main paae janevaale ghode ke baraabar tha
 Thus we see that the size of the horse increased gradually
 isi prakaar ghode kii bahu or padon kii aantarik rachana main parivartan se uski gati main vruddhi hui
 The main symptom of this change was the degeneration of the lateral parts and the expansion and enlargement of the central or axial part, so that it could bear the burden with firmness while running
 isi prakaar kalai ke bich kii haddi ko chhodkar anya sabakaa hraas ho gaya, jisase kalai drudh ho gai
 Similarly, the third finger grew, other nearby fingers disappeared and only that remains in the end

 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj

 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation
 gandhi par giraftaar kiya gaya 10 march, 1922, ko rajdroh ke liye gandhi ji par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya jisamen unhen chah saal kaid kii sajaa sunaakar gel bhed diya gaya

 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore

 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the
 At that time the entry of Harijans into the major temples of the country was completely restricted

 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933
 mandir ke trustiyon ko is baat kii taakid kii gayi ki naye varsh kaa pratham diwas arthath 1 janvari 1934 ko antim nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa or is tithi par unke str se koi nishchay na hone kii sthiti me mahatma gandhi tathaa shri kelppan dwaara aandolankariyon ke paksh main aamaran anshan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words
 gandhi ji raaj ke liye kisi party kaa netritv karte hue prachaar dwaara koi aisa lakshya siddh nahin karnaa chaahate the jise raaj ke saath asthaayee taur par rajnatik vyavastha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya jaae
 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence

 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border
 gandhi ji ke duusare number par baithe jawaharlal nehru kii party ke kuch sadasyon tathaa kuch anya rajnatik bhartiya dalon ne aalochana kii jo angrejon ke paksh tathaa vipaksh donon main hi vishwaas rakhte the
 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence
 gandhi ji or congress kaaryakaarani samiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko angrejon dwaara mubani main 9 agast 1942 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment
 raaj unhen jail main dam todate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate the jisase desh kaa krodh bad jaae
 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge
 These communities included the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha

 He tried to learn by experimenting on his own mistakes and on his own to achieve this goal
 unhone apni aatmakatha ko satya ke prayog kaa naam diya
 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya

 Non-violence, non-violence and non-violence has a long history in Indian religious thought and has many concepts in its Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian communities

 One eye for another will make the whole world blind
 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists
" naamak pustak se uddhran liye gaye hai
 The war of science leads a person to dictatorship, pure and simple

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice

 This was due to his heir apparent curiosity in which his enthusiastic friend Sheikh Mehtab also contributed

 Before coming to London to study, Gandhiji had made a promise to his mother Putlibai and his uncle Bechariji Swamy that he would abstain from eating meat, drinking alcohol and from concussion
 unhone apane vaayade rakhane ke liye upwas kiye or aisa karne se saboot kuch aisa mila jo bhojan karne se nahin mil saktaa tha, unhone apane jivan paryant darshan ke liye aadhaar jo praapt kar liya tha
 As Gandhi became an adult he became completely vegetarian
 unhone da moral basis of vegeterionism tathaa is vishay par bahut si lekh bhi likhen hai jinamein se kuch landan vegeterian sosayadi ke prakaashan da vegeterian main prakashit bhi hue hai
 Gandhi himself was inspired by many great personalities during this period and became a friend of Dr
 Josiah Oldfield, the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society
 henry stephen salt|henry stephen salt kii kritiyon ko padhne or prashansha karne ke baad yuva mohandas gandhi shaakaahaari prachaarak se mili or unke saath patrachaar kiya
 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 His success in total control celibacy without first ladder to re commitment, almost failed

 However, one day his uncle came to give Gandhi ji some time relief, he reached the bedroom for rest where his physical desires were awakened and he loved his wife and shortly after the servant left, the news came that Gandhi His father has just died
 Gandhiji felt a tremendous crime and he could never forgive himself for this
 This incident in m had a significant impact on Gandhi and he turned to celibacy at the age of 36, while he was married
 yah nirnay brahmacharya ke darshan se puri tarah prabhavit tha aadhyatmik or vyavhaarik shuddhta bade paimaane par brahmacharya or vairagyavaad se juda hota he

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 saadhaaran hindu kii tarah ve saare dharmon ko samaan rup se maanate the, or isliye unhone dharm-parivartan ke saare tarkon evam prayaason ko asweekrut kiya
 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe
 These debates reflect philosophical differences between the two
 ye donon hi us samay ke prasiddh bhartiya chintak the
 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart
 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition
 main aisa kuch nahin kar rahaa hoon
 


 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage
 likhane kii pravriti gandhiji main aarambh se hi thi
 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik
 chaahe vah tippaniyon ke rup main ho yaa patron ke rup main
 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well
 unke mahatvapurn lekhan kaary ko nimna binduon ke antargat dekha ja saktaa he: Gandhiji was a successful writer
 kai dashakon tak ve anek patron kaa sampadan kar chuke the jisame harijan, indian opinian, yang india aadi sammilit hai
 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
 Gandhiji usually wrote in Gujarati, but translated or got his books translated into Hindi and English as well
 hind swaraj naamak alpakaay granthratna gandhiji ne england se lautate samay kildonon casil naamak jahaaj par gujarati main likhaa tha or unke dakshin africa pahunchne par indian opinian main prakashit hua tha
 The first twelve chapters in the December 11, 1909 issue and the remaining in the December 18, 1909 issue
 pustak rup main iskaa prakaashan pehali baar janvari 1910 main hua tha or bharat main bombay sarkaar dwaara 24 march 1910 ko iske prachaar par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Gandhiji responded to this action of the Bombay Government by publishing an English translation of it
 is pustak ke parishisht-1 main pustak main pratipaadit vishay ke adhik adhyayan ke liye 20 pustakon kii suchi bhi di gayi he jisase gandhiji ke tatkaaleen adhyayan ke vistaar kii ek jhalak bhi milti he
 'history of South Africa's Satyagraha' originally started writing 'south African Satyagrahana History' in Gujarati on 26 November 1923 while he was in Yerwada Jail
 5 farvari 1924 ko reeha hone ke samay tak unhone pratham 30 adhyay likh daale the
 This history was published as an article in the 'navajivan' from 13 April 1924 to 22 November 1925
 pustak ke rup main iske do khand kramshah 1924 or 1925 main chape
 The first edition of the English translation by Valji Desai was published by S
 Ganesan Madras in 1928 and the second and third editions by Navjivan Prakashan Mandir, Ahmedabad in 1950 and 1961, with the required modifications
 aatmakatha ke mul gujarati adhyay dharawahik rup se 'navajivan' ke ankon main prakashit hue the
 It began with the publication of 'preamble' in the issue of 29 November 1925 and its completion from the last chapter titled 'purnahuti' in the 3 February 1929 issue
 gujarati adhyyon ke prakaashan ke saath hi hindi navajivan main unka hindi anuwaad or yang india main unka angreji anuwaad bhi diya jaataa rahaa
 Accordingly, the translation of 'preamble' was published in the 3 December 1925 issue of 'hindi Navajivan'
 hindi anuwaad main aatmakatha kaa pehla khand pustak ke rup main pehali baar sasta sahitya mandal, dilli se san 1928 main prakashit hua tha
 Navjivan Trust, the proprietor of Gandhiji's works, published his Hindi translation on his behalf in 1957
 shrimadbhagavadgita se gandhi ji kaa hardik lagaav praayah aaajeevan rahaa
 His contemplation and writing on the Gita also continued for a long time
 sampoorn gita kaa gujarati anuwaad, prastaavna sahit, unhone june 1929 main puraa kiya tha or 12 march 1930 ko navajivan prakaashan mandir, ahmedabad se 'anasakti yoga' naam se uskaa pustakaakaar prakaashan hua tha
 Its translation into Hindi, Bangla and Marathi was also instant
 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha
 Since the translation of each verse of the Gita was not easily comprehensible to the general readers, Gandhi ji wrote the expressions of each chapter of the Gita in a comprehensible way for the general readers
 yarvada central jail main 1930 or 1932 main prayek saptaah patr ke rup main ye bhav bhi narayandas gandhi ko bheje jate rahe taaki unhen ashram kii prarthana sabhaaon main padhe jaayen
 These were later published in book form named 'geeta-bodh'
 inke atirikt bhi unhone gita par prarthana sabhaaon main anek pravachan diye the
 Gandhiji's association with the Gita was such that despite his very busy life he prepared a syllabus for each verse of the Gita specifying the meaning of the verse as well as his place of use
 in samast samagriyon kaa ekatra prakaashan hi 'gita mata' ke naam se hua he
 The decision of the publication of a Granthamala by the Government of India for the publication of the complete and written literature of Gandhiji has undoubtedly been a historic step in the publishing world
 is granthmala kaa uddeshy gandhi ji ne din-prati-din or varsh-prati-varsh jo kuch kaha or likhaa us sabko ekatra karnaa tha
 Under this decision, the entire Gandhi Vaamya was published with the help of many learned scholars
 yah prakaashan teen bhashaaon main hua
 It has been published for the first time in 100 volumes in English and 98 volumes in revised form
 hindi main 97 khandon main tathaa gujarati main 70 khandon main yah prakashkeey mahakumbh sampann hua he
 Two additional features are also included in the entire Gandhi speech

 In addition to this, the collection of selected pieces from Gandhiji's entire literature and small booklets focusing on different topics have also been published under different names
 inamen do sanchayan ati prasiddh tathaa atyupayogi rahe hai or in donon kaa prakaashan bhi gandhi ji ke jivan-kaal main hi ho gaya tha: Gandhiji has also interpreted John Ruskin's Unto This Last in Gujarati

 In 2000, a revised version of Gandhiji's entire work came under controversy as Gandhiji's followers accused the government of including changes for political purposes

 Due to this reason there was a dispute in India at the time of publication of the book, and the Legislative Assembly of Gandhi's home state of Gujarat prohibited the sale of this book through a resolution
 leliveld ke mutabik, unki pustak ke aadhaar par gandhi kii samalangi yaa dwillingi hone ke lagaae ja rahe aankalan galat hai
 He said, "this book does not say that Gandhi was gay or bisexual

 In Harijan on 6 October 1946, he wrote about the partition of India to create Pakistan: jaisaa kii muslim lig dwaara prastut kiya gaya gaiyr-islamic he or main ise paapyukt kehane se nahi hichakoongislam maanav jati ke bhaichaare or ekta ke liye khadaa he, na ki maanav parivaar ke eky kaa avrodh karne ke liye
is vajah se jo yah chaahate hai ki bharat do yuddh ke samoohon main badal jaae ve bharat or islam donon ke dushman hai
 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he

 Muhammad Ali Jinnah and contemporary Pakistanis condemned Gandhi for undermining Muslim political rights

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct
 jo log hinsa ke jariye aazaadee hasil karnaa chaahate the gandhi unki aalochana ke kaaran bhi thodaa sa rajnatik aag kii lapet main bhi aa gayi bhagat singh, sukhdev, udam singh, raajaguru kii faansee ke kilaaf unka inkaar kuch dalon main unki ninda kaa kaaran bani
 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi
 or agar die gaye peeda ko ve swechhapurvak sah len to vah unhen andruni shakti or anand pradaan karegaa or hitler kii suvichaarit hinsa bhi yahudiyon kii ek saadhaaran nar sanhaar ke rup main nishkarshith ho tathaa yah uske atyaacharon kii ghoshnaa ke khilaaf pehla jawaab hogi
 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 ek atyaachaari ke haath main apni zaati ko dekar kiya
 Those who fear God are not afraid of the terror of death
 gandhi kii in vaktavyon ke kaaran kaafii aalochana huyi jinka jawaab unhone "yahudiyon par prashn" lekh main diya saath main unke mitron ne yahudiyon ko kiye gaye mere apil kii aalochana main samachar patr ki do kartane bhejin do aalochanaayen yah sanket karti hai ki maine jo yahudiyon ke khilaaf hue anyaay kaa upaay bataaya, vah bilkul nayaa nahin he
 


 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time

 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion

 The novel is one of Dikkens' best-known works and has been the subject of numerous film and television adaptations

 The book also highlights the cruel behavior of many of London's abandoned babies, which has raised international concern, sometimes referred to as "the Great London Way Crisis"
 dikkence ke yug main landan main anathon ke liye yah ek adbhut number tha
 The subtitle of the book, The Parish Boy's Progress, refers to Bunyan's The Pilgrims Progress and the prevalently ridiculous series of "A Rex's Progress" and "A Harlot's Progress" written by William Hogarth in the 18th century

 oliver twist ek anaam shahar kii ek kaaryshaala main garibi or durbhagyapurna jivan main paidaa hua he
 
 Oliver, orphaned almost since birth due to the mother's death at childbirth and the unexplained absence of his father, has been sparingly provided for under the terms of the Poverty Law and has spent the first eight years of his life as a woman named Mrs Mann
 Care spent in the baby farm
 garib kanoon ke khilaaf anya bal aparaadhiyon ke saath, oliver kam khaanaa or kuch aaraam ke saath paala gaya he
 Around the ninth birthday, Mr
 Bumble, a settlement worker, took Oliver from the baby farm and hired him to choose Occam in the same main workshop where his mother worked before his death
 oliver, jo bahut kam bhojan ke saath kathin parishram karata tha, kaaryshaala main chah maheenon ke liye hi rahaa jab tak hatashapurna bhukhe ladakon ne dher sara khaanaa praapt karne kaa yah nishchay nahin kiya ki haare hue ko dalia ke ek anya bhaag ke maangana chahie
 yah kaary karne ke liye oliver ko chunaa gaya jo bhojan ke agle prahar main katoraa lekar kapata hua aage aayaa or usne apana prasiddh: anurodh vyakt kiya ki "mahoday, kripaya mujhe or adhik chahie 
" This resulted in a huge uproar
 kaaryshaala prashasan board ke parishkrut sajjanon ne, ek parakramee raja ke liye feet bhojan khate hue, peshkash kii ki ve aise kisi bhi vyakti ko paanch pound denge jo ladke ko prashikshu ke rup main lene ke icchhuk he
 a brutal chimney sweep almost got Oliver, but when Oliver pleaded not to be sent with "that terrible man", a kind old magistrate refused to sign the contract
 Later, Mr
 Sowerberry, the surety employed by the township, took Oliver into his service
 usne oliver ko behatar tareeke se rakhaa or ladke ke udhaas chehre kii vajah se vah use bacchon kii antyeshti par ek ronewaale ke rup main upyog karata tha
 However, Mr
 Sowerberry was unhappy with his marriage and Oliver was disliked by his wife, mainly because she began to like her husband — and so she lost half her stomach and lost some opportunities to abuse him
 ve noah clepole, ek bevakoof lekin badmaash saathi prashikshu jo oliver ke nihshabd sanvardhan se irshyaa karata tha or charlote, sourberi kii daasi, jo noah se pyaar karti thi, ke haathon bhi pidaa grast the
 One day in an attempt to seduce Oliver, Noah insults his dead mother by calling them "regular right-down beds
" Oliver had an unexpected passion and attacked him, even defeating the very big boys
 Mrs
 Sowerberry favors Noa and helps her subdue Oliver, punches and beats Oliver, and later forces her husband and Mr
 Bumble to beat Oliver again, which results in the fight
 Format was sent
 jab oliver ko raat ke liye uske kamare main bheja jaataa he, to usne kuch aisa kiya jaisaa usne apane ladakpan main kabhi nahin kiya tha vah tut gaya or rone laga
 us raat akele main oliver ne antat bhaagane kaa faisla kiya
 He wandered aimlessly until a milestone turned his wandering feet to London
 apni landan yatra ke dauraan, oliver kii mulaakaat jaik dokins se hui jise saamanytah "artphul doser" upnaam se janaa jaataa he, haalanki oliver kii maasoom prakruti ne use yah pahchaanane se bachaa liya ki ho saktaa he ladkaa beyimaan he
 Dodger provided Oliver with a free meal and told him the address of a gentleman in London who would "give him room to live without anything and never ask for change"
 Grateful for unexpected help Oliver followed Dodger to visit the "old gentleman "'s residence
 isi bich oliver kii mulaakaat fegin naam ke ek kukhyat yahudee apradhi se ho jaati he jiske bare main artphul doser ne bataaya tha
 After being seduced, Oliver briefly stayed on Saffron Hill with the gang of Oliver Feagin and his pickpockets, but was unaware of their criminal occupations
 usko lagata tha ki ve purse or rumal banaate hai
 Later, Oliver goes out to make a handkerchief with the Artful Dodger and a guy named Charlie Bates of a humorous nature because there was no income
 oliver ko bahut der se is baat kaa pataa chalata he ki unka vaastavik mishan jeb kaatna he
 Dodger and Charlie steal the handkerchief of an elderly gentleman named Mr
 Brownlow and immediately run away
 shri brownlo ko jab pataa chalaa ki uskaa roomaal laapata he to usne oliver ko dekha or uskaa peechha kiya
 The others also joined in chasing him and Oliver was caught and taken to the magistrate
 maje kii baat thi ki shri brownlo kaa ladke ke bare main doosraa vichaar tha vah vishwaas karne ke liye anicchhuk tha ki vah ek jebkatra he
 To the judge's apparent dismay, a bookstall holder who saw Dodger commit the crime rescued Oliver, who by now had been really ill and fainted in court
 shri brownlo apni naukaraani shrimati bedwin ke saath oliver ko ghar le gaye or uski seva kii
 Oliver lived with Mr
 Brownlow and recovered rapidly and blossomed with undue kindness
 Although his enjoyment was interrupted when Feagin feared that Oliver might be "peachy" on his criminal gang, he decided that Oliver should be brought back to his whereabouts
 When Mr
 Brownlow sent Oliver out to pay for some books, a young girl named Nancy of the gang whom Oliver had met earlier, implicated her with the help of her abusive boyfriend, a brutal robber named Bill Sykes, and Oliver Quickly returns to Feagin's den
 choron ne usase paanch pound kaa note le liya jo use shri brownlo ne saunpa tha or uske nae kapade kii pattee rakh lee
 oliver niraash hokar bhaaga or police kii sahaayta ke liye kol karne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin berahami se doser, charlie or fegin dwaara waapas khinch liya gaya
 However, Nancy had sympathy for Oliver and saved him from the beating of Feagin and Sykes
 oliver ko nae sire se aparaadh ke jivan main aakarshith karne ke prayaas main fegin ne use chori main bhaag lene ke liye majaboor kiya
 Nancy reluctantly began to assist him in recruiting him, but she was also giving him the assurance that if she could, she would help him
 Threatening to kill if he did not cooperate, Sykes sent Oliver through a small window and ordered him to unlock the front door
 However, the robbery goes wrong and Oliver is shot
 cics dwaara chhod die jane ke baad ghayal oliver kii dekhbhaal unhi logon ne kii jinke yahaan vah chori karne aayaa tha: roj meli, uski sangrakshak shrimati meli or harry meli 
 oliver kii begunaahi kaa yakeen hone par roj ne uski dekhbhaal kii jisase vah waapas swasth ho jaye
 Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Monks discovers Fagin and conspires with Oliver to destroy his reputation
 Monks blames Fagin for the failure to criminalize Oliver, and the two form a plan together to make sure he doesn't know anything about his past
 monks jahiraa taur par kuch tareeke se oliver se sambandhit he, haalanki iskaa baad tak ullekh nahin he
 In Oliver's hometown, Mr
 Bumble marries Ms
 Corne, the workshop's rich matron, only to save herself from frequent arguments with his grieving wife
 After a similar debate, Mr
 Bumble went to a pub one day where he met Monks, who informed him of a boy named Oliver Twist
 baad main donon ne ek locket or anguthi vaapis laane kii vyavastha kii jo oliver kii maa kaa tha or unhen paas kii ek nadi main oochaal diya
 monks ne ise oliver ko nasht karne ke liye plot ke hisse ke rup main fegin se joda, parantu ve is baat se anjaan the ki nancy ne unki baatcheet sun lee he or vah oliver ko suchit karne ke liye nikal chuki he
 At this time Nancy was ashamed of her role in Oliver's kidnapping, and fearing for the boy's safety, she went out to warn Rose Miley and Mr
 Brownlow
 She learns that Monks and Feagin are planning again to control the boy and hold some secret meetings on a topic related to Oliver's well being
 ek raat nancy ne ek baithak main bhaag lene kii koshish kii lekin cics ne use anumati nahin di kyonki usne use nahin bataaya ki vastav main vah kaha ja rahi he
 Feagin realizes that Nancy has been something and tries to find out what his secret is
 is bich noah clepole pratibhu shri sourberi ke saath nikal gaye, usase paise chori kiye or landan chale gaye
 Charlotte was with him, they are now in a relationship
 "morris boltor" naam kaa upyog kar ve suraksha ke liye fegin ke giroh se jud gaye
 During a Noa stay with Feagin, the Artful Dodger was caught stealing a box of silver snuff, he was sent to Australia if found guilty
 baad main, fegin noah ko nancy ko "chakma" dene or uske rahasy kii khoj karne ke liye bhejtaa he: vah roj or shri brownlo ke saath chupake se baithak karti thi jisase fegin or monks se oliver ko bachaane ke liye charchaa kar sake
 fegin ne gusse main is baat kii jaankaree cics ko de di, usne kahani ko is tarah mode diya ki aisa prathit ho maano vaastaviktaa main nancy ne suchit kiya tha 
 nancy ko ek gaddaar samajhakar cics ne use gusse main maar daalaa or vah galati se khud bhi us samay mar gaya jab vah naaraaz bheed se bhagkar ek chat ko paar kar rahaa tha
 Monks is forced by Mr
 Brownlow to reveal his secret: his real name is Edward Layford and he is Oliver's paternal brother and although he is legitimate but is the result of an unpleasant marriage
 oliver kii maa, agnes, unke pita kaa sachcha pyaar tha
 Mr
 Brownlow had a picture of him and began questioning him when he saw a marked resemblance between Oliver and his face
 Monks spent years searching for his father's child - not to befriend him but to destroy him
 Brownlow asks Oliver to give half of his paternal money to Monks because he wants to give him a second chance; And Oliver who was prone to a second chance gladly followed this up
 monks phir america chalaa gaya jahaan usne apane paise vyarth vyay kar die, vah phir se aparaadh karne laga or ant main jail main mar gaya
 Feagin was arrested and hanged; In an emotional scene, Oliver goes to Newgate Bandraagha to meet the old astray on the eve of the execution
 ek acchhee khabar thi ki roj meli oliver kii maa agnes kii lambey samay se khoyi bahan nikalati he isliye vah oliver kii mausi he
 She marries her longtime beloved Harry and Oliver lives happily with his savior, Mr
 Brownlow
 noah ek vaitanaik arddh peshewar police kaa mubir ban jaataa he
 Bumbles lose their jobs so that punishment can be distributed with generous hands at the end
 Apparently, he has shown that Bill Sykes was sent to death by a mob for his brutal acts and sent Fagin into the condemnation room to lurk and be sentenced to death by the process there
 Neither character received redemption; Sykes tries to flee from his crime and the bewildered Feagin refuses to see or pray to the rabbi on the last night of his life, instead asking Oliver to help him escape
 iske vipareet nancy, khud apane hi jivan kii keemat par praayshchitt karti he or ek dharmik mudra main mar jaati he
 Nancy is also one of the few characters in Oliver Twist to exhibit ambivalence
 haalanki vah purna rup se ek apradhi he, jise bachapan se fegin dwaara prashikshit or shiksha di gayi he, oliver ke apharan main apni bhoomika ke pashchaatap ke liye vah kaaphi samanubhuti rakhti he, or praayshchit karne ke liye kadam uthaane ke prayaas karti he
 One of Feagin's victims, she is corrupt but not yet morally dead, she voices the horrors of the man's small criminal empire
 vah oliver ko samaan bhagya se bachaana chaahati he, usee samay vah gaddaar banane ke vichaar se peeche hat jaati he, vishesh rup se bill cics ke liye jise vah pyaar karti he
 When she was later criticized for giving her a "stolen, slut whore on the streets", such an irresponsible change of her character, Dikkens described her change of heart as "the last of the water beneath a dry well-weeded source Appropriate drop "
