4 In medicine, compliant patients describe the stage when they need to seek medical advice

 Non-compliance is a major barrier to effective delivery of health care
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan kaa anumaan yah sanket detaa he ki viksit deshon main rahane vaale gambhir rogon se peedit lagbhag 50 % rogi in upachaar anushansaaon kaa anusaran karte hai
 In particular, the lowering of diabetes rates to follow treatment for asthma and hypertension are thought to burden those circumstances to a large extent human and economic contribution
 anupaalan daron ko chikitsa sahitya main atianumanit kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki aksar aupchaarik naidanik pareekshan setting main anupaalan ucch ho jaataa he, lekin "vaastavik" setting main vah gir jaataa he
 Major barriers to compliance include the complexity of modern drug abstinence, poor "health literacy", and reduced mental perception of the benefits of treatment, side effects not discussed, drug prescription costs, and nontoxic communication or between patient and healthcare provider
 Lack of trust included
 anupaalan main sudhaar ke prayaas dawa packaging ko saral banane, prabhavi dawa anusmarak pradaan karne, rogi shiksha main sudhaar karne or dawaaon kii sankhya kii seemaa nirdhaarit karne kii ore lakshyikrut he
 More than half of the patients do not follow treatment regimens directed to them
 abhi haal tak, ise "gaiyr-anupaalan" kaha jaataa tha, jiskaa kabhi kabhi yah arth nikaala jaataa he ki upachaar ke liye die gaye nirdeshon kaa tarkahin vyavhaar ke kaaran nahin paalan kiya jaataa tha yaa unki jaanboojhkar andekhi kii jaati thi
 Today, healthcare professionals mostly use the terms "adherence" or "harmony" rather than "compliance" as a precaution, as these terms more accurately describe a variety of reasons for patients who don't follow treatment instructions
 Or partially believe
 haalanki, variya shabdaawalee ab bhi bahes kaa mudda bana hua he
 In some cases, cohesion is used specifically to refer to patients who follow treatment abstinence, which is created in collaboration with both the physician and the patient, so that it is avoided by the physician-prescribed treatment abstinence Only to be separated from obeying

 Compliance rates during closely monitored studies are generally higher than real-world situations

 The biggest obstacle to non-adherence to a prescription is its cost
 1010 vayaskon par 2001 main ek america me kiye gaye ek rashtravyapee surveykshan main paaya gaya ki 22% log uske mulya ke kaaran parchaa nahin bharna chaahate hai, jo ki parchaa nahin bhare jane ke 20-30% sampurna dar ke baraabar he
 After initiation, rarely have patients completed the guided treatment regimen and rarely completed the course of treatment
 laagat or upchar ke nirdeshon kii kam samaj upachaar puraa na kar paane kii pramukh baadhaaen hai
 As mentioned earlier, the World Health Organization estimates that only 50% of people complete long-term treatment prescribed for chronic diseases that put the patient's health at risk
 kai prakaar ke packaging tareekon main rogi kii madad karne ke liye nirdhaarit upachaar ko puraa karne ke liye kaha jaataa he

 british ekadhidaruk ko united kingdom samet kul 15 rashtramandal pradeshon, mukutiyaa nirbhartaaon or samudrapar pradeshon ke rajmukuton sattadharak ekarajeey samprabhu hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 The current ruling ruler is Queen Elizabeth II from 6 February 1952 when she succeeded the throne from her father George Sageham
 samprabhu or uske tatkaal parivaar ke sadsy desh ke vibhinn aadhikarik, aupchaarik or pratinidhi kaaryon kaa nirvaah karte hai
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but due to centuries-old common law, sovereigns are obliged to exercise most of their powers only in accordance with the specifications of Parliament and Government
 is kaaran se, ise vaastavik taur par ek sansadeey samrajyata maani jaataa he
 Being a parliamentary ruler, most of the powers of the ruler are limited to impartial and non-political functions
 samraat, shaasha or rashtrapramukh hone ke naate unke adhiktar sanvaidhanik shashan tathaa rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay ve sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai
 Traditionally, the ruler is the suzerain of the armed Baal of Britain
 haalaanki, samprabhu ke samast kaary-adhikaron kaa abhyay shaasha ke raaj-parmadhikaar dwaara hota he
 Around the year 1000, several small early medieval states had developed in the states of England and Scotland
 is kshetra main angl-sackson logon kaa varchasv england par norman vijay ke dauraan 1066 main samaapt ho gaya, jab antim angl-sackson raja harold dwitiya kii mritu ho gayi thi or angrezi satta vijai sena ke netaa, wiliam da conkarar or unke vanshajon ke haathon main chali gayi
 In the 13th century England absorbed the princely state of Wales and the process of gradual disarmament of the sovereign by Magna Carta began
 1603 main scotland ke raja james chaturth, angreji singhaasana par james pratham ke naam se virajman hokar jo donon rajyon ko ek vyaktigat sangh kii sthiti main laa khadaa kiya
 From 1649 to 1660 there was a transient republican period known as the English Commonwealth, which came into existence after the war of three states, but after 1660 the monarchy was restored
 1707 main parvartit act of setlement, 1701, jo aaj bhi parvartit he, catholic vyaktiyon tathaa catholic vyakti sang vivaahit vyaktiyon ko angrazi rajasatta par kaabiz hone se nishkarshith karata he
 In 1707, the merger of the British and Scottish empires led to the incorporation of the Great Britain monarchy, and the British and Scottish crowns were merged with it and a joint "british Ecclesiology" was established
 irish rajshahi ne 1801 main great britain rajshahi ke saath jud kar great britain or ireland kii united kingdom kii sthapana kii
 The British Erat was the nominal head of the vast British Empire, which at the time of its vast expansion in 1921, ruled over a quarter of the venom
 1922 main ireland kaa paanch-chhyai hissaa irish mukt rajya ke naam se, sangh se bahaar nikal gaya
 The Balfour Declaration, 1926, recognized the transformation of British Dominions from the colonial post into separate, self-governing, universal countries within the Commonwealth
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad british samrajya simatata gaya, or british samrajya ke adhiktar purv upnivesh va pradesh swatantra ho gaye
 Those countries which consider the former colony, the British ruler as their ruler, are called British Commonwealth divisions or Commonwealth territories
 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is referred to as the British ruler, but in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 britain kii rajatantric vyavastha main, raja / rani ko rashtrapramukh kaa darj diya gaya he
 In the British political system, which has been progressively developing and changing over a period of thousands of years, the traditional and real powers of the ruler have been fluctuating
 british rajnatik sankalpana main, britain ke samprabhu ko rajmukut ke maanvi avatar ke rup main mana jaataa he, arthath ve sampoorn rajya va puri shasampranali ke samast shasnadhikaar ke antyant strot hai, or britain par shashan karne kaa adhikaar antytah british samprabhu ke paas hi he
 Therefore, all government officials and employees, including judges, mps and all ministers, are sovereign employers and providers of authority
 tathaa nishtha kii shapath maharani ke prati lee jaati he
 And it is mandatory to obtain royal assent to all the Parliamentary Acts to be legal
 tathaa united kingdom kaa raashtragan god seve da queen he
 Apart from this, the image of the ruler is inscribed on all postage stamps, coins and currency notes
 baharhaal, shashan-prakriya, niti-nirdhaaran va prashasnic nirnay lene main, adhirat kaa vaastavik yogadan nunatam tathaa nammaatr kaa chhot he, kyonki vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhiyon or roodhiyon ke kaaran shaasha ke adhiktar adhirati shaktiyaan adhirat se mukut ke mantriyon or adhikariyon yaa anya sansthaanon ke paas pratyyojit kar di gayi hai
 Therefore, most of the works done by the rulers in the name of Rajmukut, whether done by the ruler himself, such as the Queen's address or the state inauguration of Parliament, the decisions of Surrey work are taken elsewhere: vidhayik kaary maharani sasansaad dwaara, sansad, house of lords or house of comons kii salaah or sweekruti dwaara kiya jaataa he, vahin, kaaryakari shaktiya maharani ke naam par unki mahima kii sarkaar dwaara abhyayit kiye jate hai
 In which, the Prime Minister and other ministers of the Crown and the Council of Ministers are represented, which is, in effect, a committee of the Queen's Royal Council
 tathaa shaasha kii nyaay karne or dand dene kii shaktiyaan nyaaypalika par nihit kii gayin hai, jo sanvaidhanik taur par, sarkaar se swatantra he
 The Church of England, which is headed by the Queen, has its own administrative system
 iske alaava bhi shaasha ke anya kaaryon ko vibhinn samitiyon va nikaayon ko saunpe gaye hai
 When necessary, the superintendent has the responsibility to appoint a prime minister to head his government
 alikhit samvidhan kii aitihaasik parampara ke anusaar aam taur par pradhan mantri house of comons main bahumat praapt dal ke net hote hai
 The Prime Minister takes up his assignment after a personal meeting with the ruler, in which the appointment is passed immediately, without further formalities, with a tradition of "kissing hands"
 trishanku sabha kii sthiti main, adhirat ke paar apane vivek ke upyog kar, apane icchaanusaar sarkaar ke pratinidhi kaa chunaav karne ke adhik avasar hota he, haalaanki aise sthiti main bhi reetinusaar sadan ke sabase bade dal ke netaa ko hi chunaa jaataa he
 From 1945 till date, only two such situations had occurred
 pehali baar faivari 1974 ke aam chunaav ke baad, or 2010 ke aam chunaav ke baad, jab conzarvative party or libral-democratic party ne gathbandhan banaaya tha
 Traditionally, the authority to convene and dissolve the session of Parliament was at the discretion of the ruler, and the ruler voluntarily called and dissolved the assembly
 atah dharnatmak rup se aaj bhi sansad bulaane va bhang karne ke adhikaar kaa abhyay shaasha hi karte hai
 The fixed-term Appropriations Act passed in 2011 put an end to the right to dissolve Parliament
 haalaanki satrantan karne kaa adhikaar shaasha ke paas abhi bhi he
 If a minority government demands dissolution of Parliament and declaration of new elections, the ruler is completely free to reject such demand
 dharnatmat rup se shaasha swechha se pradhanmantri ko kabhi bhi padochit kar sakate hai, parantu varttman sthiti main pradhanmantri ko stifa, mrityu yaa chunavi haar kii sthiti main hi pad se nishkashit kiya jaataa he
 The last ruler to expel the Prime Minister during his tenure was William IV, who evacuated Lord Melbourne in 1834
 samprabhu, sthapit carch of england ke sarvocch prashaasak hai
 All the bishops and archbishops of the church are appointed by the ruler, on the advice of the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri, carch ayog dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye pratyaashiyon kii ek suchi main se niyukta ko chunate hai
 Rajmukut plays a minor role in English Girja
 carch ke varishthatam padri, cantarbari ke archbishap, is carch tathaa vishwa bhar ke angalikai sampradaay ke aadhyatmik netaa ke rup main dekhe jate hai
 And the Adhirat also takes the oath of patronage of the Church of Scotland, and is also responsible for appointing the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church, otherwise, he has no meaningful role in Girja's work, nor does he have any authority over it 
 visthapit carch of wales tathaa carch of ireland main samprabhu kaa koi aupchaarik bhoomika nahin he
 By the colonial expansion of Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries, Britain occupied many other regions of the world
 jinamein se adhiktar deshon ne madhya 20veen sadi tak britain se swatantraaa hasil kar lee
 Although all those countries rejected the suzerainty of the government of the United Kingdom, many of them recognized the British ruler as their suzerainty
 aise dehon rashtramandal pradesh yaa rashtramandal prajabhumi kaha jaataa he
 At present, the United Kingdom is not only the United Kingdom, but in addition there are a total of 15 other nations
 haalanki in rashtron main bhi unhen lagbhag saamaan pad va adhikaar praapt he jaisaa kii britain main, parantu un deshon main, unka koi vaastavik raajnneetik yaa paaramparik karttavya nahin he, shaasha ke lagbhag saare karttavya unke pratnidhi ke rup main us desh ke maharajyapal puraa karte hai
 The Government of Britain has no role or interference in the work of the governments of the Commonwealth territories
 britain ke alaava rashtramandal aayam main: antigua or barbuda, australia, bahama, barbados, belize, grenada, jamaica, canada, newjiland, papua new gini, solomon dweep, saint loosia, saint kits or nevis, saint vincent or grenadins or tuvaalu jaise desh shaamil hai
 Formerly all the nations of the Commonwealth of Nations used to be part of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1950 India declared itself a republic after independence, and also abolished the sovereignty of the British monarchy as its head of state
 parantu bharat ne rashtramandal kii sadsyta barqaraar raakhi
 Since then, in Commonwealth countries, the British sovereign is also given the position of "head of the Commonwealth", which is the nominal head of the organization of the Commonwealth
 is pad kaa koi rajnatik arth nahin he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 singhasana par uttaradhikaar, vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhion dwaara anushaasit he, jinamein bill of ritis, 1689, act of setlement, 1701 or act of union, 1707 shaamil hai
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Regency Acts in 1937 and 1953, the emperor has not achieved 18 years of power, either physically or mentally incapacitated, to be carried out as regent
 ginni ke pati yaa patni,: viklaangata nimnlikhit vyaktiyon ke kam se kam teen kii pushti kerani hogi lord chancelar, house of comons ke spikar, bhagwaan ucch vakil, or scrol ke rakshak
 To complete the Regency, it also required a declaration of the same three persons
 jab aavashyak ho regency, uttaradhikaar kii uchit line ke baad regent ban jaataa he; sansadeey matdaan yaa kuch or ilaaj kii jarurat he
 Regent, is of British citizenship, and resident in Britain
 in niyamon ke anusaar, keval regent bhavishya tha jorge chaturth, jo rajya karata rahaa jab unke pita jorge III pagal ho gaya tha 
 However, the Regency Act in 1953 states that if the Regency is needed, the heir to the Queen, Prince Philip, Duke Regent of Edinburgh
 regency rani kii aavashyaktaa hogi, to regent board kii line main agle ho jayega 
 During temporary physical disability or absence from the state, the guineas could delegate their actions to the advisory state, spouse or at best four on the line of succession
 rajya kii aavashyaktaaon ke salaahkaar regent ke rup main vahi kar rahe hai
 Currently, councilors from five states: sansad, samprabhu ke adhikansh sarkari kharchon ke liye raashi sansadeey anudaan tathaa saarvajanik dhan dwaara pradaan karata he, jise "naagarik suchi" kehete hai
 And an annual grant is also allocated for maintenance of royal residences and official visits to the queen
 karmchaariyon kii laagat, rajya kaa daura, aupchaarik patibaddhtaon or aadhikarik manoranjan sahit zyaadaatar kharchon ke liye dhan kii poorti naagarik suchi dwaara hi ho jaati he
 This amount is set by Parliament for a term of 10 years
 varsh 1760 tak shaasha kii vittiya aavashyaktaayen, vanshanugat rajasav, mukutiy sampadaaon ke laabh, dwaara puri hoti thi
 In 1760, King George III agreed to abandon his hereditary Rajavan for the civil list, which lasted until 2012
 varttman samay main mukutiyaa esteton se ai mudra kii maatra civil list yaa adhirat ko pradaan kiye jane vaale anya anudaanon se bhi adhik he
 Thus between 2007-08 Crown Estates increased the treasury by £ 200 million, while 40 million pounds were paid by Parliament
 atah 7
3 arab pound kii sampada ke saath mukutiy sampadaayen britain ke sabase badi zameendaaron main se ek he, yah sari sampatti nyaas ke antargat raakhi gayi hai or samprabhu swechha se inkaa sauda nahin kar sakate hai
 Since 2012, the parliamentary grant and the civil list have been merged and replaced with a narrow sovereign grant
 mukutiy sampada kii tarah hi lankaster kii dachi kii bhoomi va sampattiyaan bhi shahi nyaas ke antargat raakhi gayi he
 All this is part of the royal allowance
 is dachi dwaara utpann rajasav ko shaasha ke "nijee kharchon" ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he, jo naagarik suchi dwaara vahan nahi kiye jate hai
 Similarly, the Duchy of Cornwall is an area, allotted for the personal expenses of the ruler's eldest son in trust
 samprabhu, mulya vardhit kar jaise apratyaksh karon ke paatr he, or 1993 se iskar tathaa puunji laabh kar ke bhi
 In this context, citizen list and parliamentary grant are not considered income, as they are given for official functions
 rani kii kul sampatti ke anumaan kaa, is baat ke aadhaar par kii, anumaan lagane main keval vyaktigat sampatti ko gina jaa rahaa he yaa shaasha ke dwaara nyaas main yojit sampatti ko bhi liya jaa rahaa he, ke aadhaar par kaaphi fark pad saktaa he
 For example, the royal collection is not the personal property of the Adhirat, but is disciplined by the "crown Collection Trust", a charity
 forbs patrika kii 2008 ke anumaan main rani kii nijee sampatti ko $ 650 million bataaya gaya tha, parantu iske koi aadhikarik aankade uplabdh nahin hai
 In 1993 Lord Chamberlain stated that the £ 100 million estimate of the Queen's personal wealth was "grossly exaggerated", announced in the press
 " The official residence in London is Buckingham Palace, which in addition to being an official residence, is also the main site of most state and royal ceremonies
 iske atirikt ek or shahi nivas he, windsar kasal, jo vishwa kaa vrihattam adhyasit mahal he, jise mukhyatah saptahik chhuttiyon, easter, ityadi jaise maukon par upyog kiya jaataa he
 The sovereign official residence of the sovereign in Scotland is the Holyrood Palace, which is located in Edinburgh
 ise samprabhu dwaara, apni scotland yatra par upyog kiya jaataa he
 Traditionally, sovereigns reside at Holyroodhouse for at least one week in a year
 aitihaasik taur par angl samprabhu kaa mukhya nivas westminster kaa mahal tathaa tower of london hua karata tha, jab tak henry ashtam ne whiteul ke mahal ko dabil kar liya
 In 1698, the Whitehall Palace was destroyed by a fierce fire, after which the royal family shifted to St
 James Palace
 haalaanki 1837 main samprabhu ke mukhya nivas ke rup main buckingham palace ne saint james palace kii jagah le lee, parantu aaj bhi saint james palace ko varisht mahal hone kaa darj praapt he, or aaj bhi vah reetispad awaas he
 The palace is still the meeting place of the succession council and is also used by other members of the royal family
 anya shahi nivaason main, clarence house or kencington palace shaamil hai
 These palaces belong to the Rajmukut, and are placed by the crown for future rulers
 samprabhu, swechha se in mehalon kaa sauda nahin kar sakate hai
 In addition, the Sandringham Palace of Norfolk and the Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire are personal properties of the Queen

 Surrounding the armor is a garter with the goal of the garter's valor written on it: "honi soit qui mal y pense"
 scotland main shaasha bhinn prakaar kaa kulank kaa upyog karte hai, usamen, pratham or chaturth khand scotland ko pradarshit karte hai, tathaa dwitiya main england or tritiy khand main ireland pradarshit hota he
 It displays two goals, below is a short section of the Scottish Inhabitant "in Defens God me Defend", "in Defens", and the Thistle order motto "nemo me impune lacessit"; As a supporter, a lion and a unicorn support two long swords, including armor, bearing the flag of England and Scotland
 shaasha kaa aadhikarik dhvaj shahi maanak he, jisame shahi kulank ko pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 This standard is displayed on the building, vessel, aircraft, or vehicle hosting the sovereign, to warn people of the sovereign's presence
 shahi maanak ko kabhi bhi ardhdand par kabhi nahin fahraaya jaataa he, kyonki aisa kabhi bhi nahin hota he kii shaasha anupasthit ho, kyonki jaise hi ek shaasha kii mrityu hoti he, vaise hi yuvaraj shaasha ban jate hai
 When the ruler is not present in his palace, the British flag is hoisted at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and Sandringham House, and the Royal Standards of Scotland are hoisted at the Palaces, Hawleyrood Palace and Ballmoral Palace in Scotland

 In communication between parties, These are the karmas which provide knowledge and experience, give advice and orders and ask questions
 This karma can take many forms, among the many forms of different manners of communication, that form is group no
 Depending on the capability of transmission, communication, elements and forms together create messages that are sent to the destination
 The target itself, the other person or person, can be another entity

 Language is an organized system of intervertebrate signs such as speech sounds, character gaps, or written symbols that transmit thoughts or expressions
 If a language calls a conversation through signs, speech, sound, expressions or written signs, what animals Can communication be known as a language? Animals have no written form of language, but use language for conversation
