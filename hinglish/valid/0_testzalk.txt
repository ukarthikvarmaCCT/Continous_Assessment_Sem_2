 Ander's role in the original Star Wars trilogy was particularly highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade, in which he shared his experience of the director of the battle to develop the techniques of the laser sword fighting of the films
 san 1971 main, universal studios ne do filmon ke anubandh ke antargat american graphity or star wars filmein banane ke liye apni sahmati jataai, haalanki apni aarambhik manchi avadharana ke liye star wars ko baad main khaarij kar diya gaya
 American Graffiti was ready in 1973, and a few months later Lucas wrote a short summary titled "the General of the Wheels", featuring apprentice C
J
 Thorpe's "jedi Bendu" as space commando - The training given by the legendary Mess Vindy is discussed
 is baat se hataash hokar ki unki kahani itani kathin he ki samajhaana mushkil he, lucas ne 13-prishthon kaa star wars ke naam se ek chota lekh likhaa, jo akira kuroskha ke da hiden fortress kaa hi halkaa-phulka rimek tha
 By 1974, he developed the draft into a rough format in a short article scripting, introducing several new elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a young boy named Anikin Starkiller as the vanguard
 duusare masaude ke liye, lucas ne anek prakaar ke sarleekaran kiye or luk ke rup main ladke ko pesh bhi kiya
 Anakin becomes Luke's father as a wise Jedi Knight
 ek alokik shakti ke rup main bal ko bhi pesh kiya
 In the next draft, the father's character was removed and renamed as Ben Kenobi, and in 1976 a fourth draft was prepared for Principal Photography
 film kaa namakaran adventures of luk star killer rakhaa gaya jo jarnal of wheels, saaga i da star wars se liya gaya
 During production, Lucas renamed Luke as Skywalker and changed the title of the film to Only The Star Wars and finally Only Star Wars
 is padaav par lucas ne yah ummid hi nahin kii thi ki film ek series kaa hissaa ban jaayegi
 patakatha ke chauthe masaude main kuch sookshm parivartan kiye gaye jis kaaran yah or bhi adhik apane aap main puri tarah paripurna santoshjanak film rahi, jiskaa ant deth star ke dhwans ke jariye puure samrajya ke apane aap hi vidhwans ho jane ke saath hota he
 However, Lucas envisioned the film as a series of audacious adventures
 Later, he realized that this would not actually be the first film of the sequel, but the second trilogy in the narrative
 ise vistaarit rup se splinter of da minds ai ke 1994 main punahprakashan ke avasar par jorge lucas kii prastaavna main charchaa kii gai he
 i had started writing Star Wars that soon i realized that it is impossible to spin this story in a single film
 jaise hi saaga or jedy jaise bahaduron kii gaatha saamne ai maine dekha ki is gaatha ko puri tarah bayaan karne ke liye kam se kam nau filmon kii zarurat padegi- teen trayee- or mujhe yah bhi ahsaas hua ki pichhali kahani se rasta banaate hue kahani ke baad tak pahunchane ke liye maine kahani ke bich se hi setting kii shuruyaat kii thi
 In the second draft, the answer about the "princess of Ondoss" was a complex problem that could not be formed; And by the time the third draft was drafted a few months later, Lucas had negotiated a contract under which the right to produce two parts of the episode was obtained
 jald hi lucas kii mulaakaat lekhak ailen dean foster ke saath hui, usne unke saath uttar bhaag kii shesh do kadiyon par upanyaas likhane kaa qaraar kiya
 It was intended that if Star Wars was successful, Lucas would be able to write scripts based on those novels
 tabatak usne bhi kaaphi vyapak rup se faili hui kahani kii pichhali kadi ko apni lekhan prakriya main sahaayta ke liye viksit kar liya tha
 When Star Wars proved successful, Lucas decided to use the film to produce a longer serial, although at one point he had decided to completely depart from the series
 jo bhi ho, lucas ek swatantra film nirmaan centre bananaa chahta tha - jo ski walker ranch ho saktaa tha- or unhen series ko vittaposhan karne vaale agent ke rup main istemaal karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Alan Dean Foster had begun writing the first of the novel, but Lucas decided to abandon the plan to adopt Foster's writing work; The following year the book was published as Splinter of the Mind's Eye
 pehle pahal aarambh main lucas ne james bond filmon kii shrunkhlaa kii hi tarah nirdhaarit shrunkhlaa kii sankhya ke bina hi filmon kii series kii purv kalpana kii
 In an interview with Rolling Stone in August 1977, he stated that he wanted each of his friends to take turns to direct films and give the series an innovative economy
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kahani kii pichhali kadi jahaan daarth vadeyr bure paksh main badal jaataa he, ljuk'sa ke pita kii hatya kar detaa he or ben kenavi ken saath ek jwalamukhi par sangharsh rat rahata he or isi bich gangey ganraajya kaa patan ho jaataa he- yah sab milakar ek utkrisht uttar katha kii sanrachana karenge
 Later that year, Lucas contracted science fiction writer Ley Brackett to write Star Wars II
 navambar 1977 ke ant tak unhone ek kahani sammelan kaa aayojan kiya, jisamen lucas ne da empire strix back naam se ek hastlikhit sankshipt rachana prastut kii
 The composition was very consistent with the film's finale except for the incident when Darth Vader does not reveal that he is Luke's father
 pehle masaude main jahaan se bracket likhnaa aarambh karegaa, luk kaa pita luk ko nirdesh dene ke liye prakat hota he
 Brackett made his first draft in early 1978; Lucas said that he was disappointed by this, but before he discussed it with her, she died of cancer
 koi lekhak uplabdh nahin hone ke kaaran, lucas ko doosraa praaroop swatah likhnaa padaa
 isi praaroop main lucas ke pehali baar filmon kii shrunkhlaa kii sankhya ke liye "episod" shabd kaa vyavhaar kiya, jisaki suchi main empire strix back episod II tha
 As Michael Kaminski has expressed his disappointment with the first draft, while arguing about The Secret History of Star Wars, perhaps Lucas had to consider turning the story in another direction
 He gave the plot a new twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father
 lucas ke anusaar, unhen is praaroop ko likhane main kaaphi majaa aayaa, kyonki yah pehali film ke saalon sangharsh ke lekhan ke thik vipareet tha or unhone sheeghra hi april 1978 tak do or praaroop likh daale
 He leads the script to the final extent of darkness when he is imprisoned by Han Solo Karbonnite and left in a prison like prison
 kahani kaa yah nayaa padaav jisamen daarth vadeyr ljuk ke pita ke rup main rahasyodghatit hota he, series par apana prabal prabhaav daalata he
 Michael Cumminski argues in his book that it does not appear that perhaps this point of the plot has been considered so seriously or even imaginaryly conceptualized before 1978, and that is why the first film was a sequel to an alternate story
 While Vader is separated from Luke's father, there is no reference to this plot point before 1978
 empire strix back ke duusare or tisare praaroop ke likhane ke baad jisamen is vindu ko shaamil kar liya gaya he, lucas ne pichhali kahani kii nai kadi jisaki usne rachana kii he uski dubaara samikshaayen kii; anakin skywanker ben kenobi kaa meghavi chaatr tha; uske ek luk naam kaa ek baccha tha lekin samraat palpatin ke prabhaav main aakar vah andhere kii paksh kii ore mud gaya tha 
 anakin ben kenobi ke saath jwalamukhi ke kshetra main ladata rahaa or aahat bhi ho gaya tha, lekin tab vah daarth vadeyr ke rup main punerjeevit ho gaya
 Meanwhile, Kenobi hides Luke at a fictional house called Tatooine until the Republic becomes an empire and Vader discovers the Jedi Knights
 pichhali kahani kii is nai kadi ke sthaan par, lucas ne faisla kiya ki shrunkhlaa trayee hogi, jisame empire strix back ko episod II agle praaroop main episod v main badal diya jayega
 laurence kasdan, jinhonen abhi-abhi reders of da lost arq likhnaa samaapt hi kiya tha, unhen agle praaroop ke lekhan ke liye anubandhit kar liya gaya or nirdeshak irven karshanar se unhen atirikt sahyog bhi mila
 Kasdan, Karshanar and producer Gary Kurtz felt that the film had become a very serious and adult film, helped by the new dark black story outline, and the series was developed from the light-hearted original storyline of the first story
 1981 main jab unhone episod VI likhnaa aarambh kiya, ab kaaphi kuch badal chukaa tha
 Building Empire Strikes Back was stressful and costly, and Lucas' personal life was also shattered
 kaaphi klaant hokar or ab aage star wars films nahin banane kii chaah rakhte hue, may 1983 main time magazine ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main usne pratigya kii ki series ke saath ab uskaa kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 Lucas's 1981 primary format featured Darth Vader competing for his authority over Luke - and in the second screenplay, "modified Primary Format", Vader became a sympathetic character
 laurence kasdan ko ek baar phir daayitv saupa gaya or in antim praroopon main, vadeyr kaa mukhauta utaar diya gaya
 This change in character will provide a sudden jump in the storyline of "tragedy of Darth Vader" which is embedded in earlier parts
 lambe 1987 main vivaah-viched ke niptaan main saubhaahgya ke lambe samay ko kho dene ke baad, lucas ko star wars main phir se laut aane kii koi ichha hi nahin rah gai or gaiyr aadhikarik taur par ritern of da jedy ke samay tak uttarbhag trayee ko radd kar diya
 However, the former part which had developed a lot, captivated his mind
 dark horse ke hasya-vyangy kii dhara or timothy zaan ke upanyaason kii trayee ke star wars ke ek baar phir se lokapriy ho jane ke baad, lucas ne dekha ki abhi bhi iske badi sankhya main darshak hai
 His children were now slowly growing up, and after the explosion of CGI technology, they were now thinking about returning and directing
 1993 tak variety ke saath anya sutron ke hawaale se isaki ghoshnaa kar di gai, ki ve purvabhag kaa nirmaan karenge
 He began to outline the story, now hinting that the series would be tragic due to Anakin Skywalker's passing the ordeal toward evil
 lucas ne kuch kahani main kuch badlaav laana bhi shuru kar diya taaki purvabhag kaa moulik ke saath saapeksh sambandh barkaraar rahe
 At first these episodes from the previous part of the previous story were considered as "filling the empty space" of history, so that parallel or tangential existence would remain, but now they saw that they would now start a new long story
 Which will begin with Anakin's childhood and end in death
 film kii series ko ek "aakhyaan" main roopantarit kar dene kii ore badhata hua antim charan tha
 In 1994, Lucas began writing the first screenplay titled Episode I: The Beginning
 is film kii release ke saath hi saath, lucas ne yah ghoshnaa kii ki vah agali do kaa bhi nirdesan karegaa or usne episod II par usee samay kaam karnaa shuru bhi kar diya
 The first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired a writer Jonathan Hales from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles to scrape the format
 film ke sheershak ke bare main anishchayta kii sthiti main, lucas ne majaak se hi sahi film ko "jaar jars great adventures" kah daalaa
 Written by The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas initially decided that Lando Kalrissian was a rodent and came from a planet with clones that led to "clone Wars" which is mentioned by Kenobi in a New Hope ; Later he introduced an alternate concept of the entire army of clones who came from the planet that attacked the republic and the Jedi Rann were repelled by the bankers
 pichhali katha ke ye aadharbhoot tatv episod II ke kathanak kii aadharshilata bane, jisamen atirikt nai gupt suchanaaen jod di gai ki sampoorn ghatnakram palpatin kii vyaktigat chal yojana thi
 Even before the release of Attack of the Clones, Lucas began working on Episode III, with specific notions to the cast of the hypothesis that the film would begin with a film collection of the Seven Clones War
 jaisaa ki unhone kahani kii ruparekha kii usee greeshm main samikshaayen kii, haalanki ve kehete hai ki unhone kathanak main amul parivartan kar suvyavasthit kar liya he
 Michael Cumminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, testifies that Anakin's fallout on the dark side forced Lucas to make a radical change in the story, the first opening scene involving Palpatine being kidnapped and Dooku as Anakin
 Killing was the first scene in the latter turning to the dark side
 san 2003 main mukhya chhayankan ke puraa ho jane ke baad, lucas ne uske puri tarah se andhere jagat kii ore mudane ko phir se likhakar anakin ke charitra main or bhi kai bade parivartan kiye; ab vah prathamtah padmi ko maut se bachaane kii talash kii ore mudega, na ki pichley sanskaran kii tarah jisamen kai kaarnon main se ek yah bhi shaamil tha, ki use vastav main use yah vishwash tha ki jedy bure the or ganraajya par kabza karne kii sajeesh rach rahe the
 This original rewrite was completed through both editing and key footage, and now the newly revised scenes were filmed during the rapid filming of 2004
 lucas series ke liye jo kuch bhi tathy pesh karte the vah aksar atishyoktipurna ho jaaya karata tha; jiskaa adhikansh uttar-1978 kii avadhi se pratifalit hua tha jab series ek mahatvapurn ghatana main badal gai thi
 Michael Kaminski elaborated that these exaggerations are both a measure of publicity and security
 kaminsaki ne tark sangat vyakhya dete hue kaha ki chunki varshon se shrunkhlaa kii kahani main amul parivartan ho gaya he
 Therefore, Lucas intended to change the original story in a retrospective manner as the audience would only see the fact from their own perspective
 san 2005 ke ek showest ke sammelan main, lucas ne nai takanic kaa pradarshan kiya or kaha ki nae 3-D ke praaroop main chah filmon ke prasaaran kii unki yojana he; jisaki shuruyaat 2007 main a new hope se hui
 However, around January 2007, Lucasfilm stated in starwars
com that "there is no definite plan and date to broadcast the Star Wars saga in 3-D"
 At a July 2007 festival in Europe, Rick Macklem confirmed that Lucasfilm "plans to convert all six films to 3-D", but that they are "waiting for companies to appear Are developing technology to reduce the level of cost so that it becomes meaningful for everyone
 In July 2008, Geoffrey Katzenberg, Chief Executive Officer of dreamworks Animation Ulasa that George Lucas is to redo 3-D all six films
 lucas ne ateet main yah sanket diya he ki vah bhavishya main chah star wars kii filmon ke nirnaayak sanskaran aagaamee peedi ke home-video praaroop par prasaarit karenge
 is bare main vichaar-vimarsh hote rahe ki is maukey kaa upyog antimprasaran se pehle kisi prakaar ke antim samaayojan, parivartan, parivardhan or / athwa film main kisi prakaar kaa vyavkalan karne ke liye karenge
 da phantum menos ke parivartit clip main revange of da sith kii DVD release ke ek vaishishty ko samyojit kiya gaya jisamen mul kathputli ko hataakar computerkrut yoda ko pradarshit kiya gaya; anemeshan ke nirdeshak rob colman ne kaha ki kilp ko keval yoda ke parikshan ke padakshep ke liye revange of da sith ke kaarykram se pehle srijan kiya gaya tha
 Lucasfilm's vice president of marketing, Jim Vord, announced that Lucasfilm wants to work on films even more, adding that "as technology progresses and we find a high-quality, sophisticated platform that customers can easily consume If we can do it, the situation will be even better, but still a lot will be left to do

 Ludwig Wittgenstein was the philosopher of Austria
 unhone tarkshastra, ganit kaa darshan, man kaa darshan, evam bhashaa ke darshan par mukhyatah kaary kiya
 He is counted among the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century
 unke jite ji ek hi pustak prakashit ho pai - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 Philosophical Investigations became quite popular in later published books
 vitgenshtin cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke professor rahe hai
 Wittgenstein's father Karl was a Jew who later adopted the Protestant religion
 vitganstin kaa sabase bada yogadan bhashaa ko darshanik paripekshya main rakhane kaa he
 When anyone mentions philosophy in linguistics today, Wittgenstein's name is automatically remembered
 vitganstin ke lekhan se kaaphi tark-vitark upja he, yahan tak ki kai baar vitganstin ke kaam ko darshanavipareet bhi kaha gaya he, kintu aisa kahana isaliye galat hoga ki vitganstin se pehle bhi tarkshastriyon ne bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan par jor daalaa tha
 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"
