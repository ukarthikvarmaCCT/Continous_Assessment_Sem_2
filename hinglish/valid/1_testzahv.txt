 Chhatrasal was a majestic warrior of the Middle Ages in India who established his kingdom in Bundelkhand by fighting the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb and attained the title of 'maharaja'
 bundelkhand main kai pratapi shaasha hue hai
 Chhatrasal, the son of Champatray, who laid the foundation of the Bundela kingdom, was a great knight and majestic king
 chhatrasaal kaa jivan mughalon kii satta ke khilaaf sangharsh or bundelkhand kii swatantraaa sthapit karne ke liye jujhate hue niklaa
 Maharaja Chhatrasal continued to fight the invasions till the end of his life
 bundelkhand keshari ke naam se vikhyath maharaja chhatrasaal ke bare main ye panktiyaan bahut prabhaavshaalee he: At the same time when Champatrai was facing life and death struggle in the land, the eldest Shukla 3 Samvat 1707 was born in the peacock hills of Vindhya forests near Kakar Kachnae village under the present Lighora development block of Tikamgarh district
 
 apane parakramee pita chanpatrai kii mrityu ke samay ve maatr 12 varsh ke hi the
 Born in the lap of the forest land, grew up in the shadow of the forest deities, the origin of this hero from Vanraj took place between cannon, sword and blood flow
 paanch varsh main hi inhen yuddh kaushal kii shiksha hetu apane mamaa sahebsingh dhandher ke paas delvaara bhej diya gaya tha
 Shortly after the death of his parents, he moved to Devgarh with his elder brother Angad Rai
 baad main apane pita ke vachan ko puraa karne ke liye chhatrasaal ne panvar vansh kii kanya devkuri se vivaah kiya
 Who has snatched his traditional manor as soon as he opened his eyes due to powerful enemies, due to the betrayal of close relatives whose brave parents have committed suicide, who has no military force or money, such a 12-13 year old child Can you imagine the mood? But he had the rite of Bundeli valor, the indomitable courage of brave mother-measure and the deep confidence of 'veer Vasundhara'
 isliye vah tutaa nahin, duba nahin, aatmghaat nahin kiya varan ek rasta nikaala
 He went with his brother to his father's friend Raja Jaisingh, enlisted in the army and started taking modern military training
 raja jaisingh to dilli sultanate ke liye kaary kar rahe the atah aunrgazeb ne jab unhen dakshin vijay kaa kaary saunpa to chhatrasaal ko isi yuddh main apni bahaduree dikhaane kaa pehla avasar mila
 Chhatrasal showed extraordinary bravery in the battle of Bijapur in May 1665 and Chhatrasal gave his life in defeating the Gonda king of Devgarh
 is seemaa tak ki yadi unka ghoda, jise baad main ‘bhalebhai’ ke naam se vibhooshit kiya gayounki raksha na karata to chhatrasaal shaayad jivit na bachate par itane par bhi jab vijayshri kaa sehara unke sir par na baandh mughal bhai-bhatijevad main bant gaya to chhatrasaal kaa swabhimaan aahat hua or unhone mughalon kii badaniyati samaj dilli sultanate kii sena chhod di
 These days, Chhatrapati's star was shining in the sky of nationalism

 Chhatrasal returned to her motherland in 1670 with the mantra of Swaraj from Shivaji, but the conditions of the then Bundel land were very poor
 adhikash riyasatdar mughalon ke manasabadaar the, chhatrasaal ke bhai-bandhu bhi dilli se bhidane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Wealth was nothing in their hands
 datia naresh shubhakaran ne chhatrasaal kaa sammaan to kiya par badshaah se bair na karne kii hi salaah di
 Orchhesh Sujan Singh did the abhishek but stayed away from the struggle
 chhatrasaal ke bade bhai ratanshah ne saath dena sweekaar nahin kiya tab chhatrasaal ne raajaaon ke bajaay janonmukhi hokar apana kaary prarambh kiya
 It is said that his childhood friend Mahabali Teli returned his heritage as a small patrimonial property, from which Chhatrasal prepared a small army of 5 cavalry and 25 infantry in the auspicious moment of Jyeshtha Sudi Panchami Sunday, 1728 A

 chhatrasaal apane rankaushal va chhapamar yuddh niti ke bal par mughalon ke chakke chhudaata rahaa
 Chhatrasal knew that the Mughals were perfect in deceptive siege
 unke pita chanpatrai mughalon se dhokhaa kha chuke the
 Chhatrasal fought with the Mughal army at many places including Etawah, Khimlasa, Gadhakota, Dhamauni, Ramgarh, Kanjia, Madiyado, Rahli, Rangiri, Shahgarh, Vansakala
 chhatrasaal kii shakti badhati gayi
 Chhatrasal recovered the punishment from the captive Mughal chiefs and released them
 bundelkhand se mughalon kaa ecchhatra shashan chhatrasaal ne samaapt kar diya

 There is a Samadhi site of Prannath in Panna which is a pilgrimage site of the followers

 Legend has it that as far as the footsteps of Chhatrasal's horse's footsteps were concerned, he became rich and rich
 chhatrasaal ke vishaal rajya ke vistaar ke bare main yah panktiyaan gaurav ke saath dohraayi jaati he- 'it yamuna ut narmada it chambal ut tose chhatrasaal son laran kii rahi na kahuhaus
 Chhatrasal was a great knight, organizer, skilled and majestic king of his time
 chhatrasaal ko apane jivan kii sandhya main bhi akramanon se jujhna pada
 In 1729, during the reign of Emperor Muhammad Shah, Subedar Bangas of Prayag invaded Chhatrasal
 uski ichha erch, konch, seveda, sopri, jalon par adhikaar kar lene kii thi
 The kings of Datia and Sehuda did not cooperate in fighting Chhatrasal with the Mughals
 unka putr hridayshah bhi udasin hokar apni jaagir main baitha rahaa
 Then Chhatrasal sent a message to Bajirao Peshwa - bajirao sena sahit sahaayta ke liye pahunchaa or usne bangas ko 30 march 1729 ko parajeet kar diya
 Bangas lost and returned

 In the realm of the family, fathers or other men have authority over women and children

 Religion, society and orthodox traditions make patriarchy more powerful
 sadiyon se mahilaayein pitrusatta ke kaaran utpeedit ho rahi hai
 There are different types of families but patriarchy is prevalent in all types of families
 parivaar main vayaskon ke yonik sambandhon ko ek saamaajik rup se sweekaar kar liya jaataa he

 Types of families: Single family and joint family Single family is a family consisting mostly of only three or four people, parents and their children
 yah vivaahit jodon par kendrit hota he
 Nowadays a single parent is also considered a single family
 avadhi ekal parivaar yah shabd sab se pehali baar 20 veen sadi main dikhaai diya
 Joint families have been around for centuries
 kai vyakti apane jivan main do ekal pariwaron kaa hissaa hote hai, ek ekal parivaar jisame wo paidaa hote hai or doosraa wo jisame shaadi karke apana ghar basaate hai
 With the advent of early industrialization and early capitalism, the single family became an economically viable social entity

2 Joint families are those in which communal use of resources is made, such as a married couple when their parents and sometimes siblings Live together bharat main sanyukt parivaar ek parampara he
 There are still joint families in many parts of the country
 bade bade shaharon ko chhod ke saare gaanvon main or saare chote shaharon main sanyukt parivaar hi maujuud he
 Such families are headed by a patriarch
 wo purush sabhi nirnay karata he
 Family income is under their control
 kulapati kii dharmapatni paariwarik nirnay lene main sakasham hoti he
 Due to urbanization and economic development, the number of joint families in India is decreasing
 kabhi kabhi ek hi kutumb main kai pidiyon ke log ek saath rahete paye jate hai
 In some societies, joint families are considered better than single families because these families have a greater sense of unity, as well as better dissemination of cultural norms and values
 sanyukt pariwaron main parivaar ke sambandhon ko vaivaahik sambandhon kii tulana main adhik mahatv diya jaataa hai
 a joint family is usually led by a patriarch
 is vyavastha ko pitrusatta kehete hai
 In such houses the male is predominant, he nurtures the family
 sanyukt pariwaron ke mukaable main ekal pariwaron main pittrusatta kii abhivyaktti jode kam paae jate hai

 According to the purpose stated in the law, when a Muslim divorced woman cannot support herself after the period of Iddat, the court may order her relatives to support her who are the heirs of her property according to Muslim law
