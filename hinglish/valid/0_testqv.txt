 anek varshon tak in rekhaon kaa kaaran gyaat nahin kiya ja sakaa, kyonki unke tarangadairdhya kisi bhi gyaat tatv kii varnakram rekhaon ke tarang-dairghy ke sadrush nahin the
 Hence, the Jyotishis imagined that a new element called 'coronium' is present in Suryakirit
 parantu shanai:-shanai: naveen tatwon kii aavart sarini ke rikt sthaan purna kiye jane lage or yah nishchaypurvak siddh ho gaya he ki coronium koi naveen tatv nahin he, varan koi gyaat tatv hi he jisaki rekhaon ke tarangadaidhyon main kirit kii prastut bhautik avasthaa itnaa parivartan kar detii he ki unka pahchaanana saral nahin
 In 1940, Adlen resolved this question completely
 saidhantik gananaa ke aadhaar par unhone yah siddh kar diya ki kirit ke varnakram kii pramukh rekhaon main se anek rekhaayen loh, nikal or calosium ke atyant ynit parmaanon dwaara utpann hoti hai
 For example, the neutral atom of iron contains 26 electrons and radiates atoms of the green line in the spectrum of Kirit, whose 13 electrons have been ionized
 kirit ke varnakram main upasthit rekhaon kii tivrata main kalankachakr ke saath parivartan hota rahata hai or adhiktam kalank par ve sabase adhik teevr hoti hai
 Similarly, if the intensity of the radiated lines is compared with the various segments of the Sun, then it can be said with certainty that all the lines are the most fierce near the stigmas
 roberts ne suryabimb ke poorviy or pashchimi koron par kirit kii dipti kaa dainik adhyayan kiya, jiske aadhaar par unhone yah siddh kiya ki kirit kii akruti bahut kuch sthaayee he or uske aksheeya ghurnan kaa aavartankaal 26 din he, jo prakashmandal ke ghurnan ke aavartankaal ke lagbhag he
 They were also able to prove that the radiant sections of the crown are centralized over the stigmas
 kalank or kirit ke deeptiman pradeshon kaa yah sambandh mahatvapurn he
 The presence of iron atoms in the kirite, which have 13 electrons ionized, indicates that the heat must be greater than 1 million degrees in the kirite
 is kathan kaa samarthan anek prakaar ke avlokan karte hai, jinamein se surya se aanevaale radio vikiran kii tivrata kaa adhyayan pramukh he
 Kirit, solar flame and the atmosphere being at a higher temperature than the lighthouse present a very odd situation
 yah adhik taap prakashmandal se tapasanvaahan ke kaaran nahin ho saktaa, kyonki ushma ucch taap se nimna taap kii ore gaman karti hai
 The cause of this extreme temperature of Kirit has not yet been conclusively known
 anek jyotishiyon ne samay samay par is vishay par anek prakaar ke vichaar prakat kiye hai, jinamein se mukhya nimnlikhit hai
 Menzle imagined that due to some difference in the Sun, vortices are formed in which the substance of the lower levels of the higher temperature of the Sun reaches its surface and to prevent the loss of heat arising due to expansion at every moment
 The whirlpool material keeps reheating
 yah padaarth vaatimandal main upar uthta rahata he or kuch samay ke pashchaat vah apni ushnata ko kirit main milakar uskaa taap bada detaa hai
 Unsold has proven that in a level near the lighthouse whose temperature ranges from 10,000 degrees to 20,000 degrees, the speed of matter is disturbed and this area of convection arises due to the ionization of hydrogen
 adhikansh jyotirvid is mat se sahamat hai ki yah pradesh shookikaaon evam kanikaon se sambandhit vikshubdh gati kaa udgam he
 According to Tomas and Hautgast, currents of hot gas from inside the Sun enter the Kirit with a velocity greater than the speed of sound and heat it to the observed temperature
 shwarschild ne bhi isi prakaar ke vichaar prakat kiye hai, parantu unka mat he ki ushn gas kii in dhaaraon kaa veg dhwani kii gati se kam hota hai
 It is not impossible that such effects have a very important part in determining the symptoms of kyrit
 olgaven ne yah siddh kiya he ki jab vidyuchhanchari padaarth chumbakeey kshetra main gatiman hota he to vidyucchumbakeey tarangen utpann hoti hai
 The motion of matter existing in the magnetic field of the Sun and stigmas is capable of generating such waves
 olgaven or walen kaa mat he ki jyon-jyon ye tarangen kirit main aage badhati hai unki urja k hraas hota jaataa he or yah urja kirit ko abhisht taap tak tapt karne main samarth hoti hai
 Now-a-days these ideas are being tested in detail and it is anticipated that this type of process may have a hand in the temperature of Kirit
 parantu samprati nishchayatmak rup se yah kahana ki drav-chumbakeey tarangen kirit ko abhisht taap tak tapt kar sakati hai athwa nahin, asambhav he
 Thus, excessive temperature of Kirit is still a mystery

 Types of organic compounds and their composition

 This list includes amino acids, sugars and fatty acids - followed by a more complex compound, followed by more complex - pigment vitamins and coenzymes, and ends up giant molecules of proteins and nucleic acids
 chayapachay maarg
 Apparently, most notable advances in biochemistry associated with the interpretation of the biosynthetic pathways of natural simple compounds, ie compounds from animal dioxide and carbon dioxide from components of animal food

 There is another problem, which engaged biochemistry - the manifestation mechanism of the functioning of specialized cells

 The gene - able to replicate a specific segment of the molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid and is capable of synthesizing 


 hanuman prasad poddar kaa naam gita press sthapit karne ke liye bharat va vishwa main prasiddh he
 Geeta Press is located in Gorakhpur city of Uttar Pradesh
 unako pyaar se bhai ji kahkar bhi bulaate hai
 Today, the name of Geeta Press Gorakhpur is not unknown to any Indian
 sanathan hindu samskruti main aasthaa rakhane vaala duniya main shaayad hi koi aisa parivaar hoga jo gita press gorakhpur ke naam se parichit nahin hoga
 From the Ramayana, Gita, Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads in this country and in every corner of the world, the only credit for delivering the stories of the sages and sages of ancient India is to Bhaiji Ji Hanuman Prasad Poddar, the founder of Gita Press Gorakhpur
 prachaar-prasar se dur rahakar ek akinchan sevak or nishkaam karmyogi kii tarah bhayeeji ne hindu samskruti kii manyataon ko ghar-ghar tak pahunchaane main jo yogadan diya he, itihaas main uski misaal milanaa hi mushkil he
 According to the Indian calendar, he was born on the day of Pradosh of Ashwin Krishna in the year 1949 of Vikram Samvat
 is varsh yah tithi shanivaar, 6 oktober ko he
 In Ratangarh, Rajasthan, Lala was a devotee of Bhimraj Agarwal and his wife Rikhibai Hanuman, so he named his son Hanuman Prasad
 do varsh kii aayu main hi inaki mata kaa swargvaas ho jane par inkaa paalan-poshan daadi maan ne kiya
 Amidst the religious rites of grandmother, the child Hanuman got to read and listen to the stories of the Gita, Ramayana Vedas, Upanishads and Puranas from childhood
 in sanskaron kaa balak par gaharaa asar padaa
 In his childhood he was taught the lesson of Hanuman Kavach
 nimbark sampradaay ke sant brajadas ji ne balak ko diksha di
 At that time the country was held in chains of slavery
 inke pita apane kaarobaar kaa vajah se kalakatta main the or ye apane dadaji ke saath assam main
 In Calcutta, he came in contact with the revolutionaries of the freedom movement Arvind Ghosh, Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das, Pt Jhabarmal Sharma and jumped into the freedom movement
 iske baad lokmaanya tilak or gopalkrishna gokhale jab kalakatta aae to bhai ji unke sampark main aae iske baad unki mulaakaat gandhiji se hui
 Bhai Ji was very impressed with the 'swatantra Samar Granth of 1857' written by Veer Savarkar and in 1938 he came to Mumbai to meet Veer Savarkar
 1906 main unhone kapadon main gaay kii charbi ke prayog kiye jane ke khilaaf andolan chalaaya or videshi vastuon or videshi kapadon ke bahishkaar ke liye sangharsh ched diya
 He started using Khadi and indigenous items in his youth
 vikram samvath 1971 main jab mahaamanaa pan
 madan mohan malviya banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana ke liye dhan sangrah karne ke uddeshy se kalakatta aae to bhayeeji ne kai logon se milakar is kaary ke liye daan-raashi dilwaai
 In a case of working with the freedom movement and revolutionaries in Calcutta, the then British government arrested several prominent traders including Hanuman Prasad Poddar and sent them to jail on charges of treason
 in logon ne british sarkaar ke hathiyaaron ke ek jakhire ko lootakar use chhipaane main madad kii thi
 In jail, Bhaiji started worshiping Hanuman ji
 baad main unhen alipur jail main nazarband kar diya gaya
 During the detention, Bhaiji used his time well and there he used to start his daily routine at three in the morning and spend the whole time meditating on God
 baad main unhen najarband rakhte hue punjab kii shimalpal jail main bhej diya gaya
 There, a homeopathic doctor used to come to jail to check the health of the prisoners, Bhai ji learned the nuances of homeopathy from this doctor and after studying the books of homeopathy started treating the patients on their own
 baad main ve jamanalaal bajaj kii prerana se mumbai chale aae
 Here he came in close contact with personalities like Veer Savarkar, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahadev Desai and Krishnadas Jaju
 mumbai main unhone agarwal navayuvakon ko sangathit kar marwari khaadi prachaar mandal kii sthapana kii
 After this, he came in the satsang of the famous music composer Vishnu Digambar and music flowed in his heart
 phir unhone bhakthi geet likhe jo `patr-pushp' ke naam se prakashit hue
 In Mumbai, he was very impressed with the Gita recitation of his cousin Jayadayal Goenka
 unke gita ke prati prem or logon kii gita ko lekar jigyaasa ko dekhte hue bhai ji ne is baat kaa pran kiya ki ve shrimad bhagavadgita ko kam se kam mulya par logon ko uplabdh karaayenge
 He then wrote a commentary on the Gita and printed it in the commercial press of Calcutta
 pehle hi sanskaran kii paanch hajaar pratiyaan bik gai
 But Bhaiji was sad that there were many mistakes in this book
 iske baad unhone iskaa sanshodhit sanskaran nikaala magar isamen bhi galtiyaan doharaa gai thi
 This hurt Bhai ji's mind and he decided that unless he had his own press, this work would not proceed
 bas yahi ek chota sa sankalp gita press gorakhpur kii sthapana kaa aadhaar bana
 His brother Goenka ji's business was in Bankura at that time and he used to stay outside often in the discourse on Gita
 tab samasya yah thi ki press kahan lagaai jaae
 His friend Ghanshyam Das used to do business in Jalan Gorakhpur
 unhone press gorakhpur main hi lagaae jane or is kaary main bharpoor sahyog dene kaa aashwaasan diya
 After this, Geeta Press was established on 29 April 1923
 == kalyaan kaa armbh samvath 1983 vikrami main marwari agarwal mahasabha kaa vaarshik adhiveshan dilli main hua
 Its Chairman was Seth Jamnalal Bajaj and the Chairman was Shri Atmaram Khemka
 Initially, Khemkaji refused to be the head of the Swatantra for some reasons, later he agreed to the insistence of Seth Jayadayal Goindka
 adhiveshan jaldi prarambh honevaala tha prashn udha swaagat bhaashan likhane kaa | khemka ji shastrajna tathaa vidwaan the, par unhen hindi likhane kaa abhyaas nahin tha
 He requested Shri Goindka to get the speech prepared
 shri goyandaka ji ne poddar ji ko dilli jaakar bhaashan taiyaar karne kaa aadesh diya
 Poddar went to Delhi and in 24 hours wrote and printed an extremely abstract speech
 log usamen vyakt vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue | adhiveshan main bhaag lene ke liye seth ghanashyam das birla bhi aaye the
 Although he did not have complete consensus with Podar ji, however, he liked the speech
 duusare din apni pratikraya vyakt karte hue unhone poddar ji se kaha -- bheji tumlogon ke kya vichaar hai kaise hai kahantak thik hai isaki aalochana hamen nahin kerani | par inkaa prachaar tumlogon dwaara samaaj main ho rahaa he janata ise dur tak maanati bhi he
 If you had, you would get more success
 You take out a letter of your thoughts
 Poddarji said - the matter is fine but i have no experience in this regard
 Birla Ji urged and said try
 At that time the matter ended here
 Ghanshyam Das ji had said one thing as a consultation
 But this became the reason for the birth of Kalyan monthly
 After the session ended, all the people went to their respective places
 Poddar ji proceeded towards Bombay
 In those days, to go from Delhi to Bombay, one had to go to Ahmedabad via Rewari and from there change the car to Bombay
 Poddar went to Rewari from Delhi
 There was a half-hour route from Rewari to Bhiwani
 Poddar ji came to Bhiwani on those days from Churu and went there to meet Seth Jayadayal Goindkaji one day
 Seth ji had to go to Bankura and Poddar ji was in Bombay
 Both came together from Bhiwani to Rewari
 On the way, he discusses the suggestion given by Ghanshyam Das Seth ji liked the idea that along with Seth ji, he had Lachhiram Murodiya
 He also agreed
 He took a promise from Poddar ji that he would give two hours of time each day for editing
 Poddar talked about his inexperience, but Murodiyaji silenced him
 Now the question of name came
 "kalyan" came out of Poddar's mouth
 Seth ji and Murodia ji liked this name
 This is the case of Chaitra Shukla 9th Samvat 1983 on the day of Shri Rama Navami
 With this it was decided that welfare should be started with Akshaya Tritiya
 | Seth ji and Murodia ji liked this name

 Shravan Krishna 11 Samvat 1983 Vikrami "got the first issue of Kalyan
 Publisher was Satsang Bhawan Nemani Badi Bombay
 Thus, the first issue of Kalyan was very much liked by everyone
 Initially it had 1600 customers, all were made and not made
 Kalyan For Gandhi, Poddarji asked for blessings
 Gandhiji advised him not to print advertisements and book reviews
 Poddar ji accepted it and gave it his life for life
 Be | today also run ads for welfare | 12 basic points of wellness and second year of the first issue Bgvnnamank special derives from Bombay | since been taken over by the Gita Press Gorakhpur publication in | the sake come Gorakhpur Poddar g Bombay | bhayeeji ne kalyaan ko ek adarsh or ruchikar patrika kaa rup dene ke liye tab desh bhar ke mahatmaon dharmik vishyon main dakhal rakhane vaale lekhakon or santon aadi ko patr likhakar iske liye vividh vishyon par lekh aamantrit kiye
 Along with this, he got the best artists to make attractive pictures of deities and published them in Kalyan
 bhai ji is kaary main itane tallin ho gaye ki ve apana puraa samay iske liye dene lage
 From editing the content of Kalyan to finalizing the look and feel of Bhaiji too
 iske liye ve pratidin atharah ghante dete the
 Instead of recognizing Kalyan as a magazine of Hinduism alone, he published the articles of scholars of all religions, Jain sages, Ramanuja, Nimbark, Madhva, etc
 in it
 bhayeeji ne apane jivan kaal main gita press gorakhpur main paune chha: sau se zyada pustaken prakashit kii
 Along with this, he also took care that these books should be available to the readers only at cost price
 kalyaan ko or bhi rochak va gyanavardhak banane ke liye samay-samay par iske alag-alag vishyon par visheshank prakashit kiye gaye
 Bhai ji, during his lifetime, kept away from propagating such works which can only be imagined
 1936 main gorakhpur main bhayankar baadh aagai thi
 When Jawaharlal Nehru came to Gorakhpur for inspection of the flood-affected area, no person provided him a car under the pressure of the then British Government, because the British Collector had given a bully to all the people that whatever Nehru ji Car will give his name written in the list of rebels
 lekin bhai ji ne apni car nehru ji ko de di
 In 1938, when there was a severe famine in Rajasthan, Bhai ji reached the famine affected area and he made fodder for the famine victims as well as cattle
 badrinaath, jagannathpuri, rameswaram, dwarka, kaaldi shrirangam aadi sthanon par veda-bhawan tathaa vidyalayon kii sthapana main bhayeeji ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 During his lifetime, Bhai Ji created more than 25 thousand pages of literature
 filmon kaa samaaj par kaisaa dushprinaam aane vaala he in baton kii chetavanee bhai ji ne apni pustak `cinema manoranjan yaa vinaash' main dedi thi
 In the name of dowry, Bhai Ji had expressed his serious thoughts on this evil by writing a motivational book like 'dowry in marriage'
 mahilaon kii shiksha ke pakshdhar bhai ji ne `nari shiksha' ke naam se or shiksha-padhdati main sudhaar ke liye vartmaan shiksha ke naam se ek pustak likhi
 Bhai ji also contributed a lot in the cow protection movement
 san 1966 ke viraat goraksha aandolan me mahatma ramachandra vir dwaara kiye gayi 166 din ke anshan kaa inhone pura samarthan kiya
 There are many miraculous and inspiring events related to Bhai ji's life
 lekin unke jivan kii sabase mahatvapurn baat yahi he ki ek sampann parivaar se sambandh rakhane or apane jivan kaal main kai mahatvapurn logon se jude hone or unki nikatataa praapt karne ke baavjood bhai ji ko abhimaan chhu tak nahin gaya tha
 He kept thinking for the common man for a lifetime
 is desh main sanathan dharm or dharmik sahitya ke prachaar or prasar main unka yogadan ullekhneey he
 He did not take a portion of the income generated from the publication of books from Geeta Press Gorakhpur and made a written document that no member of his family would be a shareholder in its income
 angrejon ke jamaane main gorakhpur main unki dharm va sahitya seva tathaa unki lokapriyata ko dekhte hue tatkaaleen angrej colector pedley ne unhen `raay sahab' kii oopaadhi se alankrita karne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, lekin bhai ji ne vinamratapurvak is prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 After this, British Commissioner Hobart proposed to confer the title of 'rai Bahadur' but Bhai ji did not accept this proposal either
 desh kii swadhinata ke baad dow, sampoornanand, kanhaiyalaal munshi or anya logon ke paraamarsh se tatkaaleen kendriya grih mantri govind vallabh pant ne bhai ji ko `bharat ratna' kii oopaadhi se alankrita karne kaa prastaav rakhaa lekin bhai ji ne isamen bhi koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 On 22 March 1971, Bhai Ji renounced this mortal body and left behind him a center known as 'geeta Press Gorakhpur', which is playing a leading role in spreading our culture across the world

 kangaroo dekhbhaal{ / 0 } ek takanic he jo khaas karke navjaat - aamtaur par aparipakv - shishuon ke liye he
 In this technique, the infant is kept - skin-to-skin, organ-to-organ - with an adult
 apripakt shishuon ke liye kangaroo dekhbhaal prati din kuch ghanton ke liye pratibandhit kiya ja saktaa he
 But when they become medically stable, then the time of this technique can be extended
 kuch mata-pita apane bacchon ko, prati din, kai ghanton ke liye apane haathon main rakh sakate hai
 Kangaroo care, a name given to marsupials who hold their young near a limb
 shuru main, yah takanic un aparipakv, pre-turm shishu ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha, jo un kshetron main janme liye the, jahaan incubetter anuplabdh nahin the yaa jahaan incubetter avishwasaneey the

 yah shaareerik or manovaigyanik aantarikta or sambandh sunishchit karata he
 The kangaroo provides ready access to nutrition
 mata-pita ke sharir kaa taapmaana navjaat shishu kaa taapmaana ko - incubetter se adhik aasaani se - sthir rakhane main madad karata he
 And gives immediate access to breastfeeding

 prakriyaaon se kaaphi alag he
 These two are not mutually exclusive
 yah anumaan he ki, aaj, 200 se adhik navjaat gahan care unit kangaroo dekhbhaal kaa prayog kar rahe hai
 a new survey has found that, 82 percent of neonatal intensive care units in the US today are using kangaroo care combined
 vishwa ke sabhi kshetron main, samay se pehle or kam vajan ke shishuon ke liye swasthya dekhbhaal or takneekee sahaytaupalabdh nahin he
 In 1978, the rising cause of death and illness, Instuto Materno Infantil necu of Bogota, Colombia
 Dr
 Edgar Ray Sanabria, presented a technique
 is takanic se, dekh-rekh karne waalon kii kami or vidhi sansadhano kii kami dur kiya jaataa he
 He suggested that mothers keep skin-to-skin contact with their underweight babies
 By this, they help to keep them warm and especially to breastfeed
 is takanic, incubetter or dekhbhaal karne waalon ko mukt kar diya
 Another feature of kangaroo care is that, despite being a pre-natal infant, she was quickly discharged from the hospital by being placed in a kangaroo establishment
 kangaroo dekhbaal se pre-machur sishu or kam vajan ke naye janme sishu ke uttarjivita daron main safal or sudhaar sabit kiya he
 This technique also reduces nosocomial infection, severe disease and respiratory tract disease
 
 yah anany stan aahaar ko lambii avadhi ke liye badhaaya he
 And improved maternal satisfaction and confidence
 mul rup se bacchon jo kangaroo dekhbhaal ke liye paatr hai, wo pre-turm shishu he jis ke vajan 1500 gram se kam vajan hai or jo swatantra rup se saans le sakate hai
 Cardiopulmonary monitoring of oximetry, supplementary oxygen or nasal ventilation, intravenous transfusion and monitor monitoring - kangaroo care is not prohibited in all of these cases
 vastav main, jo bacchon ko kangaroo dekhbhaal kiya jaataa hai, ve mand spandan or apnia se kam peedit hote hai or unke oxigen kii jarurat bhi sthirikaran rahata he
 During the early 1990s, this technology was developed in North America by NECU
 In pre-term infants and, some premature, full-term children were used for the latter
 viksit deshon main anusandhan kiya gaya he, lekin vahaan kangaroo dekhbhaal upyog karne main vilamban or ek antaraal he; kyon ki vahaan incubetaron or praudyogiki aasaani se mil jaataa he
 Typically, kangaroo care involves the child wearing only a diaper and is tied in the head-up position, with a strip of cloth, to the mother's bare chest
 bachche ke sir or gardan ko is tarah taana jaataa he, ki usko shwasarodh na ho
 The mother wears a shirt or hospital gown - open to the front
 kapadaa bachche ke nitamb ke neeche se is tarah bandha jaataa he ki akunchan mode hameshaa rahe
 The cloth is tied tight in such a way that the mother's breathing and chest motion encourage the child to breathe
 maan kii chaati se judaa jane se bachche ko ek ucch carbon dioxide vaataavaran miltaa he, jo use bhi saans lene ko uttejit karata he
 Father can also use skin-to-skin contact method
 janm ke baad, pehle 2 ghante ke bheetar, kangaroo dekhbhaal shuruyaat karne se stanpan kii avadhi ke liye sabase prabhavi safal samay he
 Many advocates of natural birth encourage immediate skin-to-skin contact between mother and child after birth, with minimal disruption
 bacchon ko garm or shushk rakhaa janaa chahie
 This method can be used continuously for a few hours or every day
 dhire dhire, yah samay badaaya ja saktaa he - khaas karke un shishuon ke saath jin ko gambheer swasthya samasyaon he
 It can be started after birth or within hours, days, or weeks
 kangaroo dekhbhaal ke samarthakon, twachaa se twachaa rakhane kii vidhi, chah saptaah ke liye protsaahit karte hai; taaki stanpan main donon bachche or maan kaa sthapana ho jaay
 or janm prakriya se swasthya laabh ho jaay
 Whereas, kangaroo care is similar to tachnik, a second tachnik - baby-wearing; But there are some differences between the two
 kangaroo dekhbhaal khaas karke pre-machur bacchon ke saath kiya jaataa he
 In this, simple tools are used and some medical care is also available
 baby-wearing tachnik alag alag prakaar ke latakan ke saath kiya ja saktaa he or saamanytah, navjaat shishuon or vaahak ke saath ek jaise vakaalat kiya jaataa he
 Kangaroo care is beneficial for parents; Because, it promotes relationships and attachment, improves parental confidence, leads to increased success in breastfeeding and milk production
 kangaroo dekhbhaal sabase adhik laabh un pre-turm or kam janm-vajan ke shishuon main detaa he; jo dar taapmaana or shwasan dar, dil normalized pradaan karte he, janm se laabh badha vajan adhik he, kam nokosomial sankraman or kam shwasan path rog ghatana ke
 iske alaava, adhyayan kaa suzav he ki jin aparipakv shishuon main kangaroo dekhbhaal kiya gaya tha; un main sangyanatmak vikaas sudhaar, vikaas kam tanaav kaa str, kam dard pratikriyaaon or motor vikaas par sakaaratmak prabhaav hota he
 By kangaroo care, helps improve sleep patterns of infants; And can be a good intervention for colic
 aspataal se jaldi chuttee milanaa, ek nateeja ho saktaa he
 Finally, kangaroo care helps promote continued breastfeeding; And enhances baby-mother relationship
 kangaroo dekhbhaal ke vajah se, maan- shishu ko aspataal main kam rahanaa padataa he
 With this, there is less need for expensive health techniques
 mata pita bhagidaari or shiksha ke avasaron main vruddhi hoti he
 And there is better use of health money
 kul milakar, kangaroo dekhbhaal ke vajah se vikasshil deshon main, rugnataa or mrityu sankya kam karne main madad karata
 prasav ke baad anuvarthi yatraaon ke dauraan shiksha ke liye avasar pradaan karata he
 And this reduces hospital-related costs

 The process of establishing a widow's labor and gurukula was started
 In 1915, a new world history was created by Pt
 Harinarayan Sharma by including 4000 Muslims and Christian people in the Aryasamaj
 He strongly opposed the dirty politics of untouchability and casteism prevalent in Hindu society and encouraged widow marriage
 In 1916, the Vishwadharma Sabha was organized in Vedratna Vidyalaya Gurukul to end the protest against the conversion and social reform movement
 In 1938, he raised the Congress Jatha against the Hyderabad Nizam
 In the movement against Simon Commission in 1929, Chandrasekhar Azad decided to kill the Saunders after meeting the revolutionaries at the Vedratna Vidyalaya Gurukul to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai due to lathicharge done by the British police officer Saunders in the movement against Simon Commission
 Revenge of Lalalajpat Rai's death by killing Was taken Aryavart was republished in 1941 by Darbhanga Maharaja Sir Kameshwar Singh due to the busyness of Pandit Harinarayan Sharma elsewhere

 These are basic and functional components of heredity
 yah unani bhashaa ke shabd jinas se bana he
 DNA on chromosome The superfine compositions made by it that carry genetic traits and transfer from one generation to another, are called genes
 jin anuvaanshikta kii moolbhoot shaareerik ikai he
 That is, we have information about our genetic characteristics like how our hair color will be, what will be the color of the eyes or what diseases we may have
 or yah jaankaree, koshikaon ke kendra main maujuud jis tatv main rahati he use diaine kehete hai
 When there is a permanent change in the DNA of a gene, it is called mutation
 yah koshikaon ke vibhaajan ke samay kisi dosha ke kaaran paidaa ho saktaa he yaa phir parabangnee vikiran kii vajah se yaa rasinic tatv yaa virus se bhi ho saktaa he
 Changes in nature may or may not result in molecular DNA mutations that result in changes in the presence or function of an outgoing organism
 jivan kii ikai koshika he or koshikaon kaa samucchy jivit shariri yaa praani kaha jaataa he
 Imagine, how would it have been if there were creatures of the same size in this world, had the same season, and if there had been only one in the night or day
 ek hi prakaar kaa bhojan, ek hi prakaar kaa kaary, ek hi prakaar ke parivesh kaa nivas ub utpann kar detaa he isiilie ham usamen kinchit parivartan karte rahete hai
 Nature also changes from boredom to boredom
 jantujgat kii vividhta par ham drushtipaat karen to paayenge ki, udhaaharan ke liye, billi jati ke jantuon main hi kitna bhed he : billi, sher, chita, singh, sabhi isi varg ke jantu hai
 Similarly, many breeds are seen in dogs native, hunter, bulldog, shaggy, etc
 is vividhta ke mul kaaran kaa gyaan sabhi ko nahin hota or sabase badi baat to yah he ki kautuhalvash bhi koi is bhed ko jaananaa nahi chahta
 This diversity seems so simple and common to us that our attention never goes to it
 kintu, yadi ham is vaividhya ke kaaran kii mimasaa karen to sachmuch hamen chakit ho janaa padegaa
 The root cause of this variation is mutation
 utparivartan kii paribhaasha anek prakaar se di gai he, kintu sabhi kaa nishkarsh yahi he ki yah ek prakaar kaa anuvanshik parivartan he
 Students of cytology know that chromosomes are found in a fixed number in the nucleus of cells
 in sutron par nishchit duriyon or sthanon par matar kii faliyon kii bhanti jeens lipte rahete hai
 Biochemically, genes are nucleic acids
 inaki ek ullekhneey visheshta yah he ki ye, koshika vibhaajan ke samay, swat: atmpratikrut ho jate hai
 a study of the Watson – Crick models of deoxyribonucleic acid revealed that the exact structure of the original structure is produced when the double Kundalini of D-N-A is copied
 is prakriya main birle hi antar padataa he
 But the mistake comes from everyone - nature is not untouched by this
 pratilipikaran ke samay, kabhi kabhi, newcliotidon ke sangyojan main dosha utpann ho jaataa he
 This defect occurs accidentally; It has been given the noun of mutation
 goldsmit ne utparivartan kii paribhaasha dete hue batalaaya he ki utparivartan vah saadhan he, jiske dwaara nae anuvanshik tip utpann hote hai
 According to Drjansky and his colleagues, mutation is a misguided point originating new varieties or breeds
 udvikas ke anek pramaanon main utparivartan ko bhi ek pramaan mana jaataa he
 In this connection, the name of the Dutch botanist, Hygo Devijr, is taken respectfully
 inhone inothera lamakiena naamak ek paudhe par kai prakaar ke prayog kiye the
 Every year there were several types of species in this plant, which they classified into five groups and based on the results of their experiments, made the following conclusions- 1
 naveen spishiz kii utpatti kramik na hokar taatkaalik ek-ba-ek hoti he; 2
 Initially, these species are stable like their parents
 3
 ek hi samay main saamaanya taur par ek saath ek jaise bahut se spishiz utpann hote hai
 4
 Mutations have no definite direction, they can develop in any form
 5
 utparivartan bich bich main kai baar ho saktaa he
 Similar experiments were conducted by two American biologists named Beedil and Tatum on a mold called Neurospora
 unhone is rog ke bijaanu ko eks athwa ultrawilet kirnon dwaara abhikarmit karke unke badhane kii gati kii jaanch kii
 They found that in the culture medium such spores were not able to grow, so they added some aminoacids
 iske falswaroop ve hi paudhe pun: vruddhi ko praapt hone lage
 Therefore, he was of the opinion that due to radiation, the normal production capacity of spores is affected and this defect is still present in the next generations
 isi prakaar ke aakasmik anuvanshik parivartanon ko utparivartan kaha jaataa he
 All kinds, shapes, chemical structures, diseases, etc
 properties of living beings can be mutated
 isi aadhaar par utparivartanon kii kai kotiyaan bana lee gai hai, jaise jin utparivartan, gunasutra utparivartan aadi
 Mutation is called instantaneous or accidental genetic mutation
 yah parivartan doshayukt hi ho, yah koi aavashyak nahin he
 Not all mutations are contaminated or harmful
 inase laabh bhi hota he or is prakritik dosha kaa laabh uthaaya bhi jaataa rahaa he
 We will revisit this in-place
 utparivartan kii ghatnaayen viral athwa yada-kada hoti hai
 Studies have been made by studies of the clan fly called Drosophila that this type of mutation is reflected in a very negligible form in any one of several million normal species
 aaltenvarg ne res ke ghodon kii aadhunik teevr gati kaa kaaran kramik aropit utparivartan batalaaya he
 This or such change can always be said to be beneficial
 bahut se udaahranon main, is utparivartan ke kaaran ghodon kii gati main nunata bhi aa sakati he
 Hence the conclusion is that mutation is "arbitrary change"
 yahan darwin kaa "prakritik varan kaa siddhant" athwa "yogyatam kaa jivan" lagu hota he, jiske anusaar is aakasmik parivartan ko sah sakanevaale jeev jivit rah pate hai, anyathaa nirbalon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 This mutation is attributed to the results of the experiments that Mandel conducted on pea beans
 utparivartan kab hoga, yah koi nishchit rup se nahin kah saktaa
 Mutation may occur at any stage or stage of growth after cytosis
 yadi utparivartan kisi ek hi bijaanu yaa yugmak main hota he to bhavi santati main se keval ek main yah parilakshith hoga
 Half of the mutated generations will have the symptoms of mutation present and the remaining half will be unaffected by them
 utparivartan ke lakshanon se yukt santatiyon kii bhavi pidiyon main bhi ve hi lakshan dikhalaai dete rahenge
 It is a difficult task to identify a mutation in cells
 kai baar to aisa bhi hota he ki vah sarvatha adrishy ho jaataa he or usapar kisi bhi drushti bhi nahin ja paati
 But mutations in germ cells are important demographically
 utparivartan kyon hote hai, iskaa santoshjanak utar jeev vaigyanikon ke paas uplabdh nahin he
 Yes, these people have devised some methods by which mutations can be done in an artificial or superimposed manner
 aropit utparivartan sarvada bahari kaarnon se hi ho saktaa he, jinhen ham neeche di gai kotiyon main vargeekrut kar sakate hai:-- 1
 If the temperature is increased up to the endpoint in temperature-generating cells, the speed of mutation will increase
 2
 rasayan-sarson ke tel kaa dhuaan, farmaldihide peroysaide, nitras amla aadi kaa prayog karne par utparivartan dar main vruddhi ho sakati he
 3
 The use of radiation-excitation, gamma, beta, ultraviolet rays etc
 also increases the mutation rate
 swargeey professor ech
je
mular ne is kaarak par anek adbhut anusandhan kiye hai
 4
 Mutation rate can be increased by an extraordinary change in the atmosphere
 jin-vinimay ke samay kuch durghatnaayen ho sakati hai
 We can divide these accidents into three groups: - inamen se pratham do prakaar ke parivartan gambhir maane gaye hai, jinase koshika kii mrityu tak ho sakati he
 The third type of change is not so serious
 anuvanshiki vaigyanikon ne utparivartan ke nimnlikhit bhed batalaaye hai:-- 1
 gene or point mutation 2
 aropit utparivartan a mutation is defined as saying that mutation is the name of a dynamic chemical change in the genetic material of a species
 ye parivartan gunasutron kii sanrachana tathaa sankhya main utpann hote hai
 Therefore, the change in molecular structure of a gene from this point of view is called "gene mutation"
 kintu, jab is prakaar ke parivartan gunasutra ke kisi binduvishesh yaa khandwishesh main dikhalaai denge to unhen "bindu utparivartan" kahenge
 In fact, there is no special distinction between these two types of changes, so these two terms are mentioned in synonymous forms
 utparivartan taatkaalik hote hai, at: inhen "taatkaalik utparivartan" bhi kehete hai
 The point mutations are very subtle and do not affect the entire organism
 at: utparivartan shabd kaa prayog saadharantaya bindu utparivartan ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 When there is a gene mutation in the reproductive cell of a human, it is transferred to its zygote and thus reaches a new generation produced by these cobies
 asankhya baar koshika-vibhaajanon ke falswaroop utparivartan jin bhi apni pratilipiyaan utpann karte karte kisi lakshan yaa gun vishesh ke liye prabhavi ban jaataa he
 Effective mutations can be readily detected in chromosomes or genes located in their carrier cells
 kintu aise utparivartan supt utparivartanon kii tulana main kam hi drushtigochar hote hai
 But as far as mutations in humans are concerned, such mutations have been shown to be mostly effective
 lingasahalagn utparivartan vishamayugmi naron main hi adhiktar dikhalai dete hai kyonki inamen lingasahalagn prabhavi jin paae jate hai
 Therefore, latent mutations of male parents are visible only in the second generation male offspring
 manushya ke adhikansh lingasahalagn utparivartan prasupt maane gaye hai
 In bisexual plants are often visible
 aprabhavi utparivartan yadi janankoshikaon main utpann hote hai to bhavi santatiyaan avashya hi vishamyugmaji hongi
 Once ineffective ineffective mutations occur, they are not visible for many generations
 kintu yahi utparivartan yadi lingasahalagn hote hai, to agali peedi main hi prabhavi ho jate hai
 Mortal mutations are considered mostly ineffective or dormant
 pranaghatak utparivartan yadi janankoshika main hi jate hai, to bhavi santati vishamayugmi hogi
 If such mutations occur in egg laying animals, then about 1 in heterozygous parents
 4 andon se bachche hi nahin utpann honge
 About the same number of offspring will die at birth or soon after taking birth, under various conditions of illusory growth
 ghaatak utparivartanee alingsutron main aam taur par dikhalaai dete hai or ye kisi ye gunasutra main ho sakate hai
 If there are lethal genes in the chromosomes of the henchman hen, then the skeleton of such an offspring would be ugly or zigzag and she would have died before birth
 kintu vishamayugmi bhrunon se bachche utpann hote hai or jivit bhi rahete hai, bhale hi unke asthipanjar tede medhe hon
 The creeper fowl of such children is called, because the legs and the waist of these chickens are bitten
 viral udaahranon main pratilomit utparivartan bhi ho jate hai
 Sometimes the mutated gene remains present for several generations and is spread among thousands of members of the same clan
 kintu, jab sahasaa kisi sadsy kii janankoshika main koi jin saamaanya aprabhavi yugmavikalpi ko utparivartit kar detaa he to aisi sthiti main ek or utparivartan ho jaataa he
 This type of regeneration has been termed the inverse mutation
 isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki utparivartan kii rogi dasha pun: saamaanya kii ore parivartit ho sakati he
 There are also some mutated conditions in bacteria in which they lose the ability to make vitamins
 kintu kuch kaal baad ve pun: vitamin utpann karne lagate hai
 Their return to normal state is called retardant mutation
 kayik utparivartan saadharantaya sharir ke utakon main hi drushtigochar hote hai
 Somatic mutations do not have long-term effects
 bhrounik avasthaa kii praathmik dashaon main honevaale utparivartanon ke kaaran sharir main chakatte ban jate hai
 Scientists believe that cancer is also a type of somatic mutation
 drosophila makkhi kii aankhe saamanyatya laal hoti hai, kintu shwet dhabbe yaa ek aankh main puri tarah kii safedi bhi dikhalaai pad sakati he
 Such flies are called mosaics
 is prakaar ke utparivartanon ke anek udhaaharan die ja sakate hai
 Scientists have found through experiments that there are three types of ambient effects on mutations, by temperature, by certain chemicals and by irradiation
 tapakram- utparivartan par tapakram kaa kya prabhaav padataa he, isapar adhiktar prayog kadli makkhi, drosophila, ko hi lekar kiye gaye hai
 In a similar experiment, when the sex-linked ineffective lethal genes were studied, it was found that 14 ° Cg
 But 0
087 percent, 22 degree centigrade
 But 0
188 percent and 28 degree centigrade
 But 0
325 percent of lethal genes were generated
 isse ek baat yah spasht hoti he ki tapakram main yadi 10 degree kii bhi vruddhi ho jaati he to utparivartan kii dar main dooni athwa tiguni vruddhi ho jaati he
 In this context, it is also interesting to note that mutation can be effected not only by an increase in temperature, but also by extreme depletion
 drosophila milenogaster ke teen dinon ke dimbhon ko -6 degree taap par rakhane par dekha gaya ki 25 se 40 minute ke bheetar inke eks tathaa dwitiya gunasutron main ghaatak utparivartan kii dar tinguni ho gai
 Astu, it is strange that extreme increase in cold and heat has almost the same effect
 aisa kyon hota he, is par abhi adhik prakaash nahin padaa he
 The fruits of chemical effects on mutation have been studied in many ways
 rasinic abhikarmo dwaara utparivartan dar main vruddhi kaa prayaas anek vidhiyon dwaara kiya gaya he
 In this context, recent experiments by Overbash and Rabson have shown that mustard smoke is a highly effective mutant medium
 vayask drosophila main uchit maatra main die gaye dhuen ke prabhaav ko dekhne par gyaat hua ki isse utparivartan dar main 10 pratishat se bhi adhik kii vruddhi ho jaati he
 In addition to mustard smoke, several paraxides, paralene, permengate, urethane, caffeine, etc
 have also been proven to increase the mutation rate

 The second deficiency was also found in them that their effect is visible only in particular stages of formulation or in particular directions of change
 isi prakaar kuch rasayan keval nar ko har prabhavit kar pate hai, maadaa ko nahin
 The reason for this has been stated that until a chemical penetrates inside the nucleus of the cell, its effect will be doubtful; Secondly, if the cytoplasm of the external chemical is neutralized, it will not have any effect

 The importance of mutations can have the following aspects: udvikasiya mahatv - aarambh main hi hamane dekha he ki sristi ke jeevajgat main vividhta drushtigochar hoti he
 The evolutionary theory holds that all of this visible molecule is made great

 Traditionally inspired by great mercy, the Bodhichitta-born, one who attains enlightenment with an innate desire for the benefit of all sentient beings, is considered a Bodhisattva
 tibeti buddha dharm ke anusaar, bodhisattva maanav dwaara jivan main praapt karne yogya chaar utkrishth avasthaaon main se ek he
 The use of the term Bodhisattva evolved over time
 pracheen bhartiya buddha dharm ke anusaar, udhaaharan ke liye gautam buddha ke purv jivan ko vishisht rup se pradarshit karne ke liye kaam main liya jaataa tha
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva

 This identity is named Bodhi
 kaha jaataa he ki buddha shakyamuni keval ek buddha hai - unke pehle bahut saare the or bhavishya main or honge
 He said that anyone can become a Buddha if he attains the Bodhisattva by following the ten Paramitas in full and attains the ten forces or lands after the Bodhisattva

 The term "web 2
0" is commonly used for web programs / applications that facilitate sharing of interactive functional information, sharing of information, designing with a user in mind, and connecting to the World Wide Web
 Web 2
0 ke udaahranon main web aadhaarit community / samudaay, host sarvice, web program, soshal netwarking site, video shering site, wiki, blog, tathaa maishap va phoxonomi shaamil hai
 a Web 2
0 site allows its users to view or exchange website content with other users while non-interactive web sites allow users to view any information as much as the information is made available for them to view
 2004 main o reli media Web 2
0 sammelan hone ke kaaran yah shabd tim o reli se judaa hua he
 Although the term refers to a new version of the World Wide Web, it does not refer to updating any technical features, but reflects changes in the way an end user / user and software developer uses the web
 
 kya Web 2
0 pehali web praudyogikiyon se gunatmak rup se alag he - yah chunauti world wide web ke avishkaarak tim berners lee dwaara di gayi he jo ki is shabd ko"shadjaal kaa ek hissaa" maanate hai - kyonki unke anusaar web pehle se hi in sab visheshtaon ko pradarshit karata he
 The term "web 2
0" was coined in 1999
 darsi dinuchi apane lekh "khandit bhavishya" main likhti hai: The term by him is mainly used for web design and creative works
 unka tark he ki duniya bhar main faile portable web ke liye taiyaar upkarnon kii vajah se web kaa vikhandan ho rahaa he
 His article primarily aimed at designers to remind them to create code for a growing variety of hardware
 is prakaar unke dwaara prayukt yah shabd sanket to karata he - lekin vartmaan main prayukt hone vaale shabd se sidhe taur par sambandhit nahin he
 The term was not in use until 2003
 in lekhakon ne is shabd se judi huyi avadharanaon par dhyaan kendrit kiya, jaisaa ki scot dietjan kehete hai, "web ek vishwavyaapee, maanakon par aadhaarit akhand manch he"
 In 2004, the term grew in popularity, when o'reilly Media and Media Live hosted the first Web 2
0 conference
 In their inaugural address, John Battle and Tim o'reilly highlighted their definition of "web as a platform" of how software programs / applications are being built on the web rather than on the desktop
 unhonen tark diya ki is pravaas / badlaav kaa ek anoothaa pahalu yah he ki "graahak aap ke liye aapke vyavsaay kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai"
 unhone daleel di ki upyogkarta dwaara nirmit saamagree kaa prayog upyogita badhaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 o'reilly and others compared Web 2
0 to the so-called "web 1
0"
 He linked Web 1
0 to the business model of Netscape and the online Encyclopaedia Britannica
 for example, netscape ne "web ek manch" ko puraane software ke rup main nirupit kiya he : unka pramukh utpaada web brouzar, ek desktop program tha or unki ranneeti brouzar ke bazaar main apane prabhutv kaa prayog karke oonchi keemton vaale sarwar utpaadon ke bazaar par kaabiz hone kii thi
 Controlling the performance standards of content and programs in a browser gave Netscape the market place Microsoft had redeemed in the PC market
 As Netscape promoted the use of webtops instead of desktops, as did the design of a horseless automobile, it was popularized by information providers purchasing Netscape servers, which would update information and use applets in webtops
 Planned to make
 sankshep main, netscape ne software banane, vibhinn avasaron par ise apadet karne tathaa ise antim upyogkarta tak pahunchaane par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 In contrast, o'reilly cites the example of Google, a company that does not focus on software production such as browsers, but instead focuses on providing data-based services
 yahan data kaa abhipraay beshak un link se he jo web pej lekhak citon main banaate hai
 Google through its "page rank algorithm" uses this user-generated content to facilitate search on the web
 software, jise ek nishchit samay par release / zaari kiya jaataa he, ke vipareet google jaisi seva ek prakriya ke madhyam se lagaataar apadet hoti rahati he jise "the perpetual beta" kehete hai
 One such difference can be seen between the online encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia: While Britannica relies on experts for its articles and releases them from time to time for publication, Wikipedia is constantly and quickly making anonymous content available to anonymous users
 Unwavering believes
 vikipedia visheshgyata par aadhaarit nahin he balki mukt stroton se software ko is ukti ko charitaarth karte hue grahan karata he - "zyaada logon dwaara dekhne par ek samasya aasaani se sulajh sakati he" or yah apane lekhon kaa nirantar nirmaan tathaa unhen apadet karata rahata he
 The o'reilly Web 2
0 conference has been held every year since 2004, attracting entrepreneurs, large companies and technology journalists
 aam janata kii bhashaa main, shabd Web 2

 Since that time, Web 2

 Web 2
0 websiten upyogkartaaon ko jaankaree praapt karne ke alaava or bahut kuch karne kii anumati detii hai
 They can allow users to run software entirely through a browser, in addition to providing "network one platform" computing built by the interactive features of "web 1
0"
 upyogkarta ek Web 2
0 site par data ke maalik ho sakate hai tathaa data par niyantran kar sakate hai
 These sites may have a "design created by participation" mechanism that encourages the user to increase the usability of the program they are using
 bhagidaari ke liye manch ke rup main web kii avadharana main aisi kai visheshtaayen hai
 Bert Decrem, founder and former CEO of Flock, calls Web 2
0 a "web partnership" and considers Web 1
0 - the source of web information
 samooh ke un sadasyon ko, jo laabh baantne ke liye koi yogadan nahin dete, nikaalane kii sambhaavna kaa koi praavdhaan nahin hone se is sambhaavna ko bal miltaa he ki tarksangat log bhi apane yogadan ko rokane ko praathamikta denge or dusron ke yogadan kaa muft main faaydaa uthaane kaa mazaa lenge
 is rokane ke liye website ke prabandhan dwaara radical trustki aavashyaktaa he
 According to Best, the features of Web 2
0 are: deep user experience, user involvement, dynamic content, metadata, web standards and scalability
 Collective intelligence can also be seen as essential properties of Web 2
0 through additional features such as openness, independence, and user participation
