 shyaam sundar das jivan ke antim kshan tak sahitya-seva main sakriy rahe
 Just before and after independence, the entire generation of Hindi grew only by sitting on Babuji's shoulders
 samay-samay par vibhinn vishyon par sammelnon main diye jane vaale unke vaktavyon kii sankhya anginat he
 Looking at all this thinking, it becomes clear how they wanted to pursue Hindi literature by connecting it with many subjects
 aaj bhi babuji kii bahut badi dein he paathya-saamagree kii pramanik rachana tathaa adhyayan ke kshetra kaa vivek
 His every minute effort to bring fresh material to the students resulted in his becoming a collector
 aalochana kii jaati he ki isi kaaran unke lekhan main gahraayi or moulikta kaa abhaav hota gaya
 But it remains to be seen that his syncretic intelligence was engrossed in the material collection of many knowledge fields
 yahan tak ki vyaavhaarik-aalochana main bhi babuji ne saamanjasywad kaa saundarya sthapit kiya
 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism
 is tarah hindi main vyaavhaarik-aalochana kaa aarmabhik maarg bhi unhone taiyaar kiya
 His efficient leadership later proved to be a boon for the Hindi-speaking region
 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays
 unhone bahut se achoote vishyon par bhi lekhnee chalaai kaviyon kii khoj tathaa itihaas sambandhi nibandhon main unki pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director
 unhone anek moulik granthon kii rachana kii
 Edited many texts
 kaashi nagari-prachaarini sabha kii sthapana main unka pramukh haath tha
 He made Hindi a place in the higher classes of the university with his efforts
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main aane se purv unhone 1900 main hindi sahitya kii samruddhi ke liye nyaayalayon main hindi ke pravesh kaa andolan chalaaya
 Till 1900, Shyamsunder Das edited the Saraswati magazine

 1907 main unhone hindi arya bhashaa pustkaalay kii sthapana kii, pracheen mahatvapurn granthon kaa sampaadan kiya or shiksha str ke anuroop paathya pustakon kaa nirmaan kaary bhi aarambh kiya
 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony
 shyaam sundar das se pehle hindi or nagari lipi ke liye vishesh rup se sankatpurna samay tha
 Pratap Narayan Mishra had established meetings for the promotion of Hindi in many places
 aisi hi ek sabha 1884 main ‘hindi uddharini pratinidhi madhya bharat sabha’ ke naam se prayag main pratishthit kii gayi
 Bharatendu Harishchandra also ventured several times for Nagari's entry into government offices, but he could not succeed
 iske baavjood praytn baraabar chalata rahaa
 Due to the court language being Urdu, the number of newly educated Urdu readers was more, due to which the work of publishing Hindi books could not proceed
 is sahitya-sankat ke atirikt nagari kaa pravesh sarkari dacrataron main na hone se nagari jaanane vaali janata ke saamne ghor sankat tha
 In the same period, Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha was established in 1893 from the industry of some enthusiastic students, among whom Babu Shyam Sundar Das was the chief
 yahan bhi ramchandra shukla kaa kathan yaad rakhana chahie ki, ‘sach puuchhie to is sabha kii sari samruddhi or kirti babu shyaam sundar das ke tyaag or satat parishram kaa fal he
 They continued to do it from the beginning till the end and kept it ready in many big industries
 iske pratham sabhapati bhaaratendu ke fufere bhai radhakrishna das hue
 The Nagari Prachar movement created new enthusiasm among Hindi-lovers and many people became devoted to the growth of literature

 Communication is the process of sending information to the sender of the receiver, in which a medium is used to convey the information so that both the sender and the recipient can understand the information conveyed
 It is a process by which animals can exchange information through different mediums
 There is a demand of communication that all parties can understand the common language which has been exchanged, Mediums are dialect, song and sometimes tone of voice and non-verbal, physical mediums such as physical gestures, gestures, even language, touch, eye contact or writing are the definitions of communication - an action by which meaning In an effort to create a common understanding of representation and communication, this process requires a repertoire of number skills, inter-personal and inter-personal processing, Un observing, speaking, questioning, sanchaar kai staron par, kai alag alag tareekon se hota he or adhiktam praaniyon ke liye, saath hi kuch mashiinon ke liye bhi 
yadi samast nahin to adhiktam adhyayan ke kshetra sanchaar karne ke liye dhyaan ke ek hisse ko samarpit karte hai, isliye jab sanchaar ke bare main baat kii jaae to yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki sanchaar ke kis pahalu ke bare main baat ho rahi he
 Definitions of communication range wide, some recognize that animals can communicate with each other and humans, and some are limited and include only humans within the parameters of human symbolic interaction

 a typical example is called the speech act
 In the presence of communication noise on this transmission channel, source realization and decoding can be faulty and thus The type of speech act can be desired with the expected result
 The problem with this code writer - transmission - receipt - encroachment sample is that it appears that both the code writer and the scribe have some tool that works as a code book
 And this code book is definitely like AX if not AX
 haalaan ki code kitaab jaisaa is model main kuch vivakshit he, veh darasal he nahin or is kaaranvash sankalpanaatmak baadhaaen aati hain Principles of co-regulation Communication is described as a constructive and dynamic continuous response, as a discrete exchange of information in the rung

 Most human languages use sounds or expressions to help with communication with those around them
 There are thousands of human languages and they have many similarities, although these similarities also differ

 The origin of the word in the language of Pandurang is like διά as in the sense of flowing like a word) necessarily does not indicate that as humans have begun to use the word, the confusion between the prefix διά and δι-
 Due to this, it is understood that communication takes place only between two parties

 Human communication has necessarily been considered as a highly developed form of animal communication
 The study of animal communication which is called zoogeology or zoosemiotics 'it says, apart from human communication), ethics is a huge contribution in the development of social biology and animal understanding, it is quite clear why That humans are capable of interacting with animals, especially dolphins and other animals used in the circus, but these animals learn to learn special methods of communication
 Understanding animal communication and the animal state is a rapidly evolving field and the 21st century
 There have been revolutions in different areas of the world, such as personal symbolic names, animal feelings, animal civilization and learning and behavior which were considered long learned

 Fungi communicate for their growth and development, such as the formation of mycelia and excrete progeny
 In addition, fungi communicate with a variety of bacteria with their own and related species, and with non-fungal bacteria, especially extracellular organisms
 , Eucaryotes, Semio-chemicals used with plants and insects are of biotic origin and fungal organisms are specifically processed
 While the same chemical application does not provoke the fungal bacteria to process without being part of the biotic message, this means that the fungal bacteria have the ability to distinguish the molecules of a species from the biotic message

com / watch?v=-p7kthrgoeg dashakumarcharit, dandi dwaara pranit sanskrit gadhykavy he
 It is named "daskumarcharit" due to the characterization of Das Kumaras in it
 dandi dwaara rachit "avantisundari katha" naamak gadhykavy kii khoj se dashakumarcharit kii samasya or bhi jatil ban gai he
 These options are present whether Dashakumarcharit and Avantisundari Katha's author Dandi are the same or different; And if the authors of these two are considered to be the same sentence, then are these two prose complement each other or are two independent prose
 kuch vidvan is paksh main hai ki avantisundari katha hi mul dashakumarcharit kaa khoyaa hua bhaag he or donon milakar ek hi gadhykavy hai
 The second class of scholars do not agree with this idea at all
 dashakumarcharit ke hastlikhit tathaa prakashit sanskarnon main praaia: teen bhaag hai- Out of these, only the middle part of the book, which is divided into eight incantations, is considered to be the original work of Dandi, but because it contains an incomparable story of Rajavahana and stories of seven friends, it is incompatible
 shesh bhaag arthath purvapithika or uttarpithika anya lekhakon kii rachanaayen hai jo kalantar main mul granth ke aadi or ant main kramash: jod di gai he
 Scholars believe that Dandi must have composed the complete text first, but later that part was destroyed due to reason
 dandi ke mul granth ke aath uchhvaason main keval aath kumaron kii katha aati he
 But by combining the story of the two kumaras given in the foreground, the number of ten kumaras is completed
 isi prakaar mul granth ke aathven uchhvas main varnit apurna vishrut charit ko uttarpithika main puraa kiya gaya he
 Bhoja in his Saraswati Kantabharana has quoted the praise verse of the forehead
 at: yah bhaag gyarahavin shatabdi ri
 purv hi jud chukaa hoga
 There are several versions of the Uttarapeethika - one of Chakrapani, another of Narayana, and some parts of Padmanabha
 kyonki mukhya katha main ullikhit baton se purvapithika evam uttarpithika main kari sthanon par virodh paaya he at: purvapithika tathaa uttarpithika ko pashchaadvarti siddh karnaa sugam he
 For example, in the main part, Arthapal and Pramati are the sons of Kampal whose mother's names are Kantimati and Taravali respectively, but in the pre-pedestal, Arthapal is the son of Taravali and Pramati is the minister named Sumati
 isi prakaar mukhya bhaag main vishrut ke pitamah kaa naam sindhudutt he parantu purvapithika main unka naam padmodbhav he
 In the main part, the prince gets entry into the harem with the help of the princess's anuj but with the help of a cooperative scholar in the antechamber
 isi prakaar granth main anek virodh evam vipratipattiyaan vidhman hai
 The first exorcism of the original Dasakumarcharit begins by presenting the main hero prince Rajavahana as a prisoner
 baad main champa ke abhiyaan main rajvahan ko uske bhuule bhatke sabhi saathi mil jate hai jo shesh saat uchchhavaason main apni-apni romaanchakaari evam kutuhljanak ghatnaon ko rajvahan se kehete hai
 In the second high story comes the story of the gift Varma, which is very detailed and humorous
 marichi naam ke rishi tathaa vaastu-paal naam ke shreshthi kaa pravanchanaa bahut rochak he
 Nayak's experience in the theater and burglary in homes are comical incidents
 tritiy uchhvas se lekar shashth uchhvas tak kramash: uphaar verma, arthpal, pramati tathaa mitragupta kii kathaayen hai
 The third exorcism has the legend of the gift Varma
 usne rajypahari ke man par adhikaar karke apni adbhut soundarya dene kii shakti ke vishay main sujhaayaa
 Thus, he was killed on the pretext of beauty and recovered his father's lost kingdom
 chaturth uchhavas main batalaaya gaya he ki arthpal ne apane pita ke khoe mantripad tathaa manikarnika naamak rajkumaari ko praapt kiya
 The fifth occupies the princess of Pramati Shravasti in exile
 yuvaraj kii yatra ke varnan main graamy tathaa naagarik jivan kaa anek prakaar kaa ullekh praapt hota he
 The pageant reclamation describes the attainment of the princess of Khun country by Mitragupta
 isamen dandi ne samudr par kiye gayi saahason kaa varnan kiya he
 There is a story of Mantragupta in the seventh exile
 is uchhvas kii yah visheshta ullekhneey he ki isamen kathavaktaa kaa oshth uski preyasi dwaara kaate jane ke kaaran oshth se uccharyman pavarg ke varnon kaa prayog nahin hua he
 The eighth exile describes Vishruta's adventures, which brings the Prince of Vidarbha to his lost kingdom
 isamen raajnneetishastra par parishkrut vyang he
 The strong rendering of joy and easy living is based on flawed
 ekaek prarambh ke samaan yahan kriti ekaek samaapt ho jaati he
 Dashakumarcharit has a unique place in Sanskrit literature
 vastut: yah sanskrit gadhykavy aadhunik upanyaason ke bahut nikat he
 It presents an all-round realistic picture of the society then
 dashakumarcharit dhoortta se purna kavy kaha jaataa he
 Dutikrida, denting, cunning, slyness, trickery, violence, murder, forgery, kidnapping and illicit love are all found in one or all of these stories
 lekhak kaa samaaj ke prati vyavhaar ativ sopalambh he
 Brahmins, monks, kings, princesses and pious sadhus have been ridiculed
 devataaon ko bhi nahin choda gaya
 But its purpose is not to support immorality
 logon kii mithyaa manyataon kaa vishleshan karke samaaj ke sammukh prastut karnaa hi inkaa mukhya uddeshy he
 The main storyline is meticulously threaded with inverted stories
 katha kaa pravaah jo aadi se ant tak abadhgati se chalata he, rochak evam kutuhalavardhak he
 Among the available ancient Sanskrit prose, Dandakumarcharita is the only prose written in a simple and natural prose style
 dandi kaa charitra-chithran bahut prabhaavshaalee he
 He has exhibited life-portraits of Marichi Rishi, Ganika Kammanjari, and Dhatri Shringalika and officer Kantak of soldiers
 kavi dwaara prastut manoranjan sthitiyon main hasya evam vyangy abhivyaapt hai
 Undoubtedly, Dandi has authority over language, but he does not exaggerately describe things and by subtly displaying the maturity of his poetry, he impresses on the reader's heart
 sanskrit aalochak unke utkrisht shabd soundarya kii saraahna karte hai
 This famous utterance is popular among scholars, 'dandin: Padalityam' and its Dandi officer
 anupras ke lalit prayog se dandi manoranjak dhwani prabhaav utpann karte hai
 They use long spells but do not allow ambiguity of meaning in a person
 unke varnan prabhaavshaalee evam hridaygrahi hote hai parantu ve pathak ke hriday ko aakarshith kiye rakhte hai kyonki unke alankaaron ke prayog evam varnaneey vishay main ek kalatmak santulan rahata he
 Examples of Dandi's Padlatyya include athwa Examples of this type are often found in orientalism and prove the dictum of 'dandin: Padalityam'
 dandi kaa padlaalitya gaurav kaa vishay he
 His language possesses tenderness, sophistication, elegance, prasad and melody
 dashakumarcharit padhane par pathak ko yah anubhuti hoti he ki vah kuch saras rachana kaa rasaswad kar rahaa he
 The sensations of life come before the eyes and he feels the poet as a strange friend
 dandi ke gagadhy main na to subandhu ke tulya 'pratyakshrashlesh' kii yojana he or na baan ke sadrush 'sarasasyarvarnapad' kii kritrimata
 It has fluent language of daily behavior
 chote-chote pad or vaakya navashishuon ke samaan krida karte hue drushtigochar hote hai or ve sahasaa hriday ko aakrisht kar lete hai
 The Manish style used in fiction and novels reflects this
 bhashaa kii sarasata, madhurata or sahaj sundarata neeras main bhi sarasata kaa abhas kar detii he
 In the description of Raja Rajhans and his wife Basumati, Padalithaya and Madhurya are visible: sharleen hewood ek australian mahila cricket team kii purv mahila cricket khilaadi he, jo australia ke liye 1980 ke dashak main ek divasiy antarrashtriya match or test cricket match khelaa karti thi

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga Vamana was the fifth incarnation of Vishnu and the first incarnation of Treta Yuga

 They are also known as Upendra in South India

 According to the Bhagavata story, Vishnu took this incarnation to restore Indra's authority in Devaloka
 devloak asur raja bali ne hadap liya tha
 Bali was the son of Virochan and grandson of Prahlada and was known as a compassionate demon king
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki apni tapasya tathaa taaqat ke madhyam se bali ne trilok par aadhipaty hasil kar liya tha
 Vamana, under the guise of a dwarf Brahmin, went to Bali and urged him to give three steps worth of land for his stay
 unke haath main ek lakdi kaa chaataa tha
 Despite the warnings of Guru Shukracharya, Bali promised Vaman
 vaaman ne apana aakaar itnaa badha liya ki pehle hi kadam main puraa bhuulok naap liya
 In the second step, Devalok measured
 iske pashchaat brahma ne apane kamandal ke jal se vaaman ke paanv dhoye
 Ganges originated from this water
 tisare kadam ke liye koi bhoomi bachi hi nahin
 Convinced of the promise, Vamana then presented his head to take the third step
 vaaman bali kii vachanabaddhata se ati prasann huye
 As Bali's grandfather Prahlada was a great devotee of Vishnu, Vamana decided to give Bali to the Hades and put his third step in Bali's head, which resulted in Bali reaching the Hades
 ek or katha ke anusaar vaaman ne bali ke sir par apana pair rakhkar unako amartv pradaan kar diya
 Vishnu appeared in his great form and conferred the title of Mahabali to the king because Bali had proved himself to be the Mahatma due to his piety and commitment
 vishnu ne mahabali ko aadhyatmik akaash jane kii anumati de di jahaan unka apane sadguni dada prahlada tathaa anya divine atmaaon se milanaa hua
 Vishnu, as Vamnavatar, taught Bali that nothing arises in life through arrogance and arrogance, and that wealth is fleeting

 shwa vilopan vah pratikriya he jisamen hindi, kashmiri, punjabi, gujarati, marathi, bengali, maithili or bahut-si anya aadhunik hind-arya bhashaaon main sahi uccharan ke liye unki lipiyon ke vyanjanon main nihit shwa kii dhwani ko tyaagna anivaary he
 This deletion is very important for the mother tongue of those languages to be understood and the tone of the speaker is right
 is shwa vilopan ke bina vaachak yaa to spasht gair-maatrubhaashi lagata he yaa phir use samajhane main hi kathinaayee ho sakati he
 Schwag deletions are a challenge for computer-readers and learners of languages because scripts in these languages often do not explain where to place and discard shwah
 aadhunik hindi ko likhane ke liye devanagari lipi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen aupchaarik rup se har vyanjan ke ant main agar halant na laga ho to 'a' ki dhwani jodi jaati he
 But for correct pronunciation of Hindi, the 'schwa elimination rule' of Hindi says that this shwa is often removed at the end of words and under certain circumstances
 ise kabhi-kabhi is prakaar se likhaa jaataa he: 'a -> ø | swar vyanjan _vyanjan swar'
 This means that according to the script, if a vowel is followed by a consonant followed by a vowel and is followed by a vowel that also has a vowel behind it, the middle vowel is discarded
 masalan 'ajgar' shabd ko dekha jaae to yah 'a+j+a+g+a+r+a' he lekin shabd ke ant vaala 'a' or 'a+j' or 'g+a' ke bich kaa 'a' donon hataa die jate hai, jis se 'ajgar' shabd kaa saadhaaran bolchaal main sahi hindi uccharan 'ajgar' he
 This is often evident in transliterating English
 'patna' shahar ko dekha jaae to lipi ke anusaar yah 'p+a+t+a+n+aa' he, jo angreji main 'patanā' likhaa jayega 
 But the Schwah deletion rule removes the middle Schwah, so in fact the correct pronunciation is 'p + a + t + n + aa', ie 'pat
nā'
 usee tarah 'uttar pradesh' ko agar aupchaarik lipi ke anusaar dekha jaae to yah 'uttara pradesha' hona chahie, lekin shwa vilopan kii vajah se yah 'uttar pradesh' ban jaataa he
 Note that due to the Schwah deletion, the pronunciation of certain syllable groups changes according to the situation in their word
 'saral' kaa uccharan 's+a+r+a+l' he jisamen ant kaa shwa villopit he
 But in 'sarla' the 'A' of the middle 'R' is removed as per rules, ie 'S + a + a + L'
 usee tarah 'paalak' or 'palki' main bich ke 'l' kaa shwa pehle to rakhaa jaataa he lekin dusre shabd se hataa diya jaataa he
 In the same way, the correct pronunciation of 'beats' in 'dil ki dhadkan' is 'dhadakne', ie the air of 'e' was removed
 lekin 'dil dhadkane laga' main 'dhadkane' kaa sahi uccharan 'dhadakne' he, yani is dafaa 'd' kaa shwa rakhaa gaya lekin 'k' kaa shwa hataaya gaya
 Mother tongues in Hindi pronounce these words comfortably without thinking, but this makes it difficult for non-female speakers and computers
 aksar unke galat uccharan se unki boli 'ajeeb' or 'sunne vaale ke liye samajhanen main kathin' lagati he

 It is the discipline that studies the initiation, transformation and physical and chemical properties of the actions that can be observed and incorporated in the sky
 beesvin shatabdi ke dauraan, vyavsaayik khagol shaastra ko awalokik khagol shaastra tathaa kaalpanik khagol tathaa bhautik shaastra main baantne kii koshish kii gai he
 There are very few astronomers who do both because different fields require different proficiency, but most professional astronomers find themselves on one of the two sides
 khagoliki brahmad main avasthit akashiya pindon kaa prakaash, udbhav, sanrachana or unke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan khagoliki kaa vishay he
 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges
 akaash ganga kaa vyas lagbhag ek lakh prakashavarsh he
 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system
 sthaneey nakshatra pranali akaash ganga ke antargat prati second 200 mile kii gati se chal rahi he or sampurna akaash ganga duurastha bahya jyortimalaon ke antargat prati second 100 mile kii gati se vibhinn dishaao main gum rahi he
 The Moon is a satellite of the Earth on which human steps have reached
 is brahmad main sabase vismayakari drishy he- akaash ganga kaa drishy
 Every person can see them with naked eyes in the open sky of night
 dekhne main yah halke safed dhuen jaisi dikhaai detii he, jisamen asankhya taron kaa bahulya he
 This sky Ganga is crooked
 iskaa pravaah uttar se dakshin kii ore he
 But just before dawn, it flows from northeast to west and south
 dekhne main akaash ganga ke taare paraspar sambhddha se lagate hai, par yah drushti bhram he
 The distance between wires adjacent to each other can be billions of miles
 jab sate hue taron kaa yah haal he to dur dur sthit taron ke bich kii duuri aisi gananaatit he jise kah paanaa mushkil he
 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything
 isiilie prakashavarsh kii ikai kaa vaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he
 Suppose there is nothing very far after any other constellations of the universe, etc
, but this thing cannot be final
 yadi uske baad kuch he to turant yah prashn saamne aa jaataa he ki vah kuch kahan tak he or uske baad kya he? isiilie hamane is brahmad ko anadi or anant mana
 Apart from this, it is not possible to express the vastness, generality of the universe in other words
 antariksh main kuch sthanon par doordarshee se gol guchchhe dikhaai dete hai
 These are called star clusters or gluteular stars ie Tara Clusters
 isamen bahut se taare hote hai jo bich main ghaney rahete hai or kinare biral hote hai
 Looking at the sky from the telescope, some spots are visible somewhere
 ye badal ke samaan bade safed dhabbe se dikhaai dete hai
 These spots are called nebula
 is brahmad main asankhya niharikas hai
 Only a few of them can be seen
 is aparimit brahmad kaa ati kshudra ansh ham dekh pate hai
 Due to modern discoveries, as the capacity of binoculars increases, the range of this visible region of the universe increases
 parantu vartmaan paridrishy main brahmad kii puri thaah maanav kshamta se bahut dur he
 The modern era of astrophysics began with the German physicist Kirchak
 surya ke vaataavaran main sodium, louh, magnesium, calcium tathaa anek anya tatwon kaa unhone pataa lagaaya 
 In our country, the late Professor Meghnad Saha has done important work in the study of physical elements of the Sun and stars
 unhone varnakramon ke adhyayan se khagoleey pindon ke vaataavaran main atyant mahatvapurn khojein kii hai
 Nowadays, two eminent scientists of our country, Dr
 S
 Chandrasekhar and Dr
 Jayant Vishnu Narlikar are also involved in solving the mysteries of the universe
 bahut pehle koparnicus, tiko brahe or mukhyat: capler ne khagol vidya main mahatvaparnu kaary kiya tha
 The three laws that Kepler has proposed in relation to the motion of planets remain the cornerstone of astrophysics
 khagol vidya main newton kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn rahaa he
 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars
