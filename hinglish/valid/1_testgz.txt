 Currently no effective medicine has been prepared for this disease
 vartmaan chikitsa evam upachaar abhi is rog or iske dushprabhav ke bare main koi thos parinaam nahin de paae hai
 Cerebral palsy can be seen divided into three parts
 spastic cerebral palsy sabase aam he
 This happens in about 70 to 80 percent of cases
 phir bhi elahabaad ke ek dow jitendra kumaar jain evam unki team ne oesassies naamak ek therapy se purvottar bharat ke ek bachche par prayog pehali baar kiya
 According to him, this will not only enable children to stand on their own feet, but will also be able to run
 etoxic cerebral palsy kii samasya lagbhag das pratishat logon main dekhne main aati he
 About 2
5 million children in India are victims of this problem
 is sthiti main vyakti ko likhane, tankan main samasya hoti he
 Apart from this, a person has a lot of difficulty in balancing while walking in this disease
 saath hi kisi vyakti kii drishy or shravan shakti par bhi iskaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the problem of ethoid, the person has difficulty in standing upright and sitting
 saath hi rogi kisi cheez ko sahi tareeke se pakad nahin paata
 For example, he is unable to use toothbrushes, pencils properly
 is rog kaa ilaaj bhautik chikitsa se purna rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 In today's government hospitals, children are not treated as cerebral palsy merge treatment
 kuch khoj se gyaat hua bharat main cerebral palsy rog se kareeb pachis lakh bachche grasht he
 With the use of physiotherapy treatment and botox injection, about fifteen lakh full healthy and five lakhs can be treated highly
 lekin mahage injekson evam sarkari aspataalo main pathbhrasht physiotherapysto kii vajah se ye bachche maut ke muh main samaa jate he
 Families are given incorrect information related to the merge and treatment
 bhautik chikitsak maheene do mahine main parijan ko physiotherapist bana ke baccho ko chikitsa se dur kar diya jaataa he
 Instead of regular treatment, one day is given at intervals of one day, and one day in a week and full physiotherapy treatment is advised to the family
 physiotherapi upachaar polio evam cerebral palsy marz se grasht baccho ko purn milane kii byavastha ho jaye to baccho ko viklaangata se mukti dilaayi ja sakati he
 It is shocking to the inner soul that people connected with the medical profession have made medicine only a means to earn money
 maanavtaa, chikitsa dharm manvi, sanskrit is sammanit peshey se vilupt hota ja rahaan hai
 The people of the idealistic educated society are insensitive to the life-threatening actions of the physician in the doctor money and the excessive inhuman work of the doctors who ignore the pain of the pain
 jo din ba din atyadhik path bhrasht evam maanavtaa se bihin hota ja rahaa aaj kaa chikitsa samaaj apratyaksh kitne maashum logo ke hatya jaise sagin aparaadh salya chikitsa ke naam karata he
 In the coming time, senior doctors of the medical society have not given due attention to the evils of the rising medical money, then every dispensary of the country will be called after the slaughter
 jo maanavtaa sanskrit chikitsak or ardashavaadi shikshit samaaj ke chehre pe badnumaan daag ke rup main ankit hoga
 This doctor will be extremely hurt for family members Tino

 Where defense lawyer Sajjan Raj Surana has been making new revelations one after the other
 adhivaktaa sajjanraj surana ne ladki kii umr va janmatithi ke sambandh main bataaya ki anusandhan adhikari dwaara peedita ke maatr janm praaanpatr ke aadhaar par secondary ajukeshan board kii ankatalika record par lee gai he, parantu anusandhan adhikari dwaara secondary ageucation board main aavedan patr ko record par nahin liya tathaa abhiyojan paksh yah bhi sabit nahin kar paaya ki ankatalika main jo janmatithi kaa ankan he vah kis dastavej ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 Fake certificate of school made after the incident adhivaktaa sajjanraj surana ne antim bahes ko aage badhaate hue kaha ki abhiyojan ne sant asaramji baapu ke khilaaf farji tareeke se gavaah or sakshya banaae he, unhone kaha ki uttarapradesh sthit shahjahanpur ke praathmik skool ke principal arvind vaajapeyi ne court main mithyaa gavaahi di thi ki vah ] tak skool kaa principal tha
 Whereas in reality he retired a year ago
 adhivaktaa surana ne kaha ki tathakthith ghatana ke baad peedita abhibhavak ne shadyantr ke tahat ladki kaa schuli sthanantaran pramaan patr banaaya or court main pesh kar diya, iske vipareet beemaa policy ke dastavej kii taraf nyaayalay kaa dhyaan kendrit karte hue vakil ne bataaya ki is policy ke dastavej main ankit janmatithi ke aadhaar par ghatana ke din peedita balig thi
 Birth date deficiencies revealed in court 


 bachaav paksh dwaara rakhe gayi tarkon ke samarthan main sarvocch nyaayalay va ucch nyaayalay ke drushtaant bhi padhakar sunaaye gaye
 Also, the deficiencies of the contradictory statements of the prosecution witnesses were revealed before the court
 baapu asaramji ke adhivaktaa ne daawa kiya he ki peedit ladki us samay naaballig nahin thi jis samay usne manai gaanv, jodhpur main asaramji baapu par chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha 
 He gave examples of several cases of High Court and Supreme Court saying that life insurance is a legal document which is sufficient evidence in any age related dispute in law
 ladki kii maan ne jo jivan beemaa kharidi thi usamen ladki kii janm dinaank 1 / 7 / 1994 ullekith he or is janm dinaank ke mutabik ladki ne jis samay kaa aarope lagaaya he us samay wo naaballig nahin thi balki 19 saal se zyada kii ho chuki thi
 So on what basis was the act imposed on Sant Asaramji Bapu? adhivaktaa sajjanraj surana ne yah bhi kaha ki ladki kii umr sambandhi alag-alag dastavejon main antar hone ke baavjood abhiyojan paksh ne isaki parvaah nahin kii or kisi adhikrut adhikari se un dastavejon main jo umr sambandhi antar aa rahaa tha, uski jaanch nahin karwaai
 Bapu Asaramji of Manai Farm House was not a trustee 

 bachaav paksh adhivaktaa ne aage bahes jari rakhte hue kaha ki agar baapu aashaaraamji jodhpur manai farm house ke trustee the, to abhiyojan paksh ne is sambandh main koi saboot pesh kyon nahin kii? agar koi vishwaas yogya hoti to register hoti, koi vyakti aakar usko sabit karata, parantu kaa koi documentt pesh nahin hua
 Therefore, the allegations made about being trustees have zero value
 adhivaktaa sajjanraj surana ne pehle bhi nyaayalay main saboot sahit kai khulaase kiye hai 1- 5 days after the FIR was conducted
 wo bhi jodhpur kii ghatana bataakar, dilli main raatri 2:45 baje FIR kiya
 2- Several pages of the register were torn in a suspicious manner
 3- FIR do din baad nyaayalay main pesh kii gai
 4- Different age of girl found in different certificate
 5- FIR likhte samay kii gai video recording gaayab kar di gai
 6- The difference between the carbon copy of FIR and FIR was found
 7- medical main nahin mila ek kharonch kaa bhi nishaan, medical main bhi clinit mil chuki he
 8- According to Subramaniam Swamy ji - call details showed that at the time when the incident was being told, she was talking to her friend and was talking to the boy through the message all night
 9 - ladki kii maan dilli main hi giraftaar karwaanaa chaahati thi
 10- The incident which has been told by the girl and her parents to tell the shadow of the ghost, is imagined and made false
 aapako bataa den ki adhivaktaa # surana ne or bhi kai # khulaase kiye he jisase saaf pataa chalata he ki # baapu # aashaaraamji ko # shadyantra ke tahat # fansaaya # gaya he
 Surana has not disclosed the case only in the court
 It is not the case that veteran jurist Dr
 Subramaniam Swamy has come to the court before and made sensational revelations and told that Bapu Asharamji has been sent to jail in a planned conspiracy
 dow
 subramanyam swami to grahamantri rajnath ko bhi bataa chuke he ki baapu aashaaraamji ko jail main rakhane kaa phaltu Asaram is currently lodged in a jail in Jodhpur and is trying for bail
 unhone apni jamaanat ke liye ram jethmalani ko apana vakil niyukt kiya
 It was argued by Jethmalani in the Rajasthan High Court that the girl accused was adult and mentally deranged and her client was implicated under a conspiracy
 tivi channel par yah samachar dekhte hi shahjahanpur main rah rahi peedit balika ne aahat hokar apane baap se kaha ki vah ab jeena nahin chaahati
 The victim's father said that Asaram will be punished by the court but the lawyer who falsely accuses his daughter will be punished in the court of God
 baharhaal, adaalat ne aagaamee 1 oktober 2013 tak kaa vakt jethmalani ko saboot jutaney ke liye diya
 During the hearing in the court of Judge Nirmaljit Kaur on 1 October 2013, the prosecution alleged that Asaram was suffering from a disease called child sexual abuse
 gavaahon kii gavaahi adhuri he is mudde ko dekhte hue jaj ne asaram kii jamaanat yachika khaarij kar di
 The charges have reached his son Narayan Sai
 vah abhi tak faraar he or police ke haath nahin aa rahaa
 Given these circumstances, the court has decided to keep him in judicial custody
 filhal asaram nyaayik hiraasat main rahenge
 Kripal Singh, one of the witnesses of Asaram's case caught on charges of misdemeanor, died on Saturday night
 unhen shuukravaar raat ghar lautate samay agyaat bike savaar badmaashon ne goli maari thi
 After his condition worsened, he was referred to Mission Hospital in Bareilly late on Friday, where he died
 yon shoshan ke maamle main jodhpur jail main band asaram ko 25 april 2018 buudhvaar ko jodhpur kii vishesh adaalat ne aaropee maanate hue daashi qaraar diya gaya
 After this decision, the security of Jodhpur has been tightened

romaniat main bahudhaa kuch nishchit saamaanya lakshan ubhaynishth hote the: naitik vyagrata, sahaj bodh or vyaktivaadita ke mulyon par aasthaa or yah purvadharna ki swaabhaavik jagat acchhee kaa strot he or maanav samaaj buraai kaa
 Romanticism became popular in the fields of American politics, philosophicalism, and the arts
 is aandolan ne america ke krantikari josh or un sabhi logon ko aakarshith kiya joki shuruuaati kathor dharmik parampara vyavastha se mukt hone ko aatur the
 Romantic rejected rationalism and religious intellectualism
 isane kelvinavaad ke virodhiyon ko aakarshith kiya, jisame yah vishvas sammilit tha ki brahmand or iske antargat sabhi ghatnaayen, ishwar ki shakti par adhrith hai
 This romantic movement gave rise to the New England superlative which demonstrated the relationship between God and the universe as less restrictive
 is nae dharm ne vyakti ke ishwar ke saath sambandh ko adhik nijee rup main prastut kiya
 Both Supremacism and Romanticism similarly attracted Americans
 ek naitik darshanashastra ke rup main, shreshthatawad na to vyavasthit he or na hi taarkik
 isane tark se adhik mahatv bhaawanaaon ko diya or vyaktigat abhivyakti ko kanoonee or rudigat avarodhon se upar rakhaa
 isane un logon ko aakarshith kiya jo apane dharmanishth purakhon ke kathor ishwar se ghrinaa karte the or unhen bhi aakarshith kiya nav england advaitvaad ke nishprabh ishwar se ghrinaa karte the

 They used to discuss cultural rejuvenation and opposition to materialism of American society
 ve "paramatma" kii shreshth main vishvas rakhte the or maanate the ki vah achchhai ke liye ek sarvavyaapak shakti he jisane sabhi ko janm diya he or sansar kii sabhi vasteen uskaa hi ek bhaag hai
 American independence welcomed individuals and opposed the bonds of neo-conservatism and religious traditions
 america main romani aandolan ne ek nayi saahitiyik vidha kaa rachana kar di jo aadhunik lekhakon ko bhi prabhavit kar rahi he
 Novels, short stories and poems take the place of sermons and proclamations that were associated with early literary theories of America
 romani sahitya nijee v gambhir tha or aisi bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karata tha jinhen kabhi nav pracheenwaad main nahin dekha gaya tha
 America's preeminence with freedom became a great source of inspiration for libertarian writers because they were happy with the display of free expression and emotion without being the object of controversy and laughter
 vah apane charitron ke manovaigyanik vikaas par adhik prayaas karte the
 The heroes and heroines displayed extreme enthusiasm and sensitivity
 svachhndtavaad vaad ke dauraan anek yuddh hue
 saat varshiya yuddh ke saath saath french or bhartiya yuddh or phir american kranti or uske fouran baad hui francisi kranti 
 All these wars and the political and social upheaval going on with them, serve as the backdrop of Romanticism
 yuddh ke dauraan utpann kathor bhaawanaaon ne kala or sahitya, jaisi pehle kabhi nahin dekhi gayi, ke pravaah ke liye utprerak kaa kaary kiya
 This writing was actually so different that it started its new romantic era
 romani yug kii rachanaayen sahitya kaa ek vishaal evam anoothaa sangrah he
 However, in all these compositions, three things are common - love of nature, sense of nationalism and sense of special attraction
 These simple characteristics can be seen by adding that these compositions have been written in times of political turmoil
 udhaaharan ke liye, romani sahitya main rashtrawaad is tathy ko ingit karata he ki us samay ke lekhak apane desh, deshavaasiyon or unke dhyey par abhimaan karte the
 It was a way of fighting those writers themselves
 iske alaava, romani yug kaa lekhan uske pehle kiye gaye lekhan se bahut alag he, jisamen unhone "jan-saadhaaran" kii baaten kii hai
 The goal of the Romani writers was that literature and art should be for everyone, not for the common man, but only for the rich and special people
 romani yug ke pehle kaa adhikansh sahitya or uski style sirf dhani ucch-varg par kendrit thi
 Romantic writers had a hand in changing this - and perhaps because they were trying to connect with the common people
 yuddh or rajnatik bechaini ke samay main ye lekhak apane samakaksh janon se judane kii koshish kar rahe the or ye unase upar ke str ke logon ke vipareet tha jo ki ladaai ko badhaava dete the
 During the Romani period, we can see an increase in women writers
 yah bhi is tathy ki pushti karata he ki yah samay yuddh se bharpoor tha
 The women stayed at their homes, they had no other way to express their feelings, fight for the cause and join their partners
 mairi fowret or unke jaisi mahila romani lekhikaayen aisi bhaawanaaon se prabhavit hai jo kabhi-kabhi swayan yuddh kaa sandarbh ban jaati hai, udhaaharan ke liye fowret kii "waar in da air "
 The society that was so covered with time warfare, that society and every aspect of that time, even every form of art, will not be affected by it, this thinking is unfair
 ham sahitya ke kisi bhi ansh ko uthaa kar dekh len, un par yuddh or saamaajik uthaa-puthal kaa prabhaav spasht varnit he
 Under the leadership of a new generation of French schools, European paintings showed an asymmetry between Swanchal sensibility and neo-ancientism, as the education of the neo-ancientists was taking place in a training school

 in Norway Dahl and Hans Güde, accompanied by Francisco Goya in Spain, and Theodore Géricault in France, Eugène Delacroix, Theodore Casserou and others; American visual arts also had a counterpoint to Romanticism, particularly in the seamless elevation of the American panoramic view found in the Hudson River School paintings

 From the earliest times of the movement, when his focus was on the development of the national language and lingua franca, the importance of local customs and traditions, the movements that would again map Europe and lead the self-determination of nationality; Nationality, its role, expression and meaning became the major carriers of Romanticism
 shuruuaati romani rashtrawaad kaa ruso ne atyadhik samarthan kiya or johan gotfrid von harder ke sujhaavon dwaara, jinhone 1784 main yah tark diya ki bhugol vyakti kii prakritik arthvyavastha kii rachana karata he or unke samaaj v rivaajon ko ek aakaar pradaan karata he
 People who speak the same language are connected to each other through many invisible bonds of nature, long before any human art developed; They begin to understand each other and make themselves even more clearly understandable; They exist only in living together and they are complete ones which cannot be separated


 only when each person is left to himself and he will make himself based on his unique talents and only then , When each person develops himself on the basis of the same common characteristics - then and only then, will the manifestation of Godhood in its true sense as it should be
 rashtrawaad ke drushtikon ne loksahitya ke sankalan ko bros grim jaise logon dwaara protsaahit kiya, puraane mahakavyon kaa rashtriya ke rup main punah prachlan, aise nae mahakavyon kii rachana jo puraani style ke hon, jaise ki kailvaala, joki finland kii kathaon or lok sahitya se sankalit tha, yaa osian, jisame ki un pracheen jadon kii khoj kii gayi he jin par daawey kiye gaye hai
 The idea that fairy tales remain in the same form for thousands of years until they are corrupted by an external literary source is not special among the Romani nationalists, but they are easily reconciled with this idea
 Used to make that such stories express the fundamental nature of the people
 udahaaran ke liye, bros grim ne apane dwaara sankalit kai kathaon ko asweekrut kar diya kyunki vah charles parault kii kahaniyon ke saamaan thim, ji unke anusaar yah pradarshit karata tha ki yah kathaayen purna rup se german nahin hai; unke sankalan main sleeping beauty kaa sthaan bana rahaa kyunki brinhildr kii kahani ne unhen is baat ke liye sahamat kar liya ki nidramagn rajkumaari kaa charitra pramanik rup se german he
 Independenceism played an important role in the national awakening of many people of central Europe who did not have their own national state, and not only in Poland, which had recently lost its independence when the Russian army led by Nicholas i k revolutionaries were abolished

 Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and military struggle for freedom also became the prevalent style of art of this period

 He started his journey working as a model
 mumbai main aane ke baad saleem kai vigyapanon main dikhaai diye
 While doing advertisements, his interest in films started growing and after this he got an opportunity to work as an actor in two films of y-films, which is a part of Yash Raj Films
 saaqib kaa janm dilli main 8 april 1988 ko hua tha
 His father runs ten restaurants, which are spread all over Delhi
 inaki ek bahan, huma kureshi or do bhai, naeem kureshi or haseen kureshi hai
 While finishing his college, Saqib also helped his father run his restaurant
 lekin unhen bhojanalay chalaane main koi bhi ruchi nahin tha
 At that time he started his journey as a model
 inke pita chaahate the ki ve dilli main hi rah kar vyavsaay prabandhan main snatakottar kii oopaadhi praapt karen, lekin ve mumbai chale gaye
 Saqib started his journey playing cricket from Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir, and started moving as a model after coming to Mumbai
 isi dauraan unhen tivi vigyaapan milane lage
 During this time, he started getting interested in acting in films
 inke kareebi dost varun bahal ne yash raaj films main audishan ke liye madad kiya
 He was called eight months after that
 inhen vaai-films ke ek hasya-prem kahani mujhase friendship karoge main mukhya kirdaar ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 In 2010, a friend reported that Yash Raj Films was auditioning for new faces
 saleem ne bhi usamen audishan diya
 But after about eight to nine months, he came to know that he had been selected
 unhen mujhase friendship karoge film main mukhya kirdaar ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 The film is a Facebook-based love story, in which a love story begins with mistaken identity
 is film main ye college main padhane vaale ek ladke, vishaal bhatta kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai, jo apane doston ke saath kaaphi mazaaq karte rahata he
 There is a village in Kramulu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India

 Template: Marxism In Marxist thought, communist society or communist system is a type of society and economic system that emerged from technological advances in productive forces representing the ultimate goal of the political ideology of communism, it is believed to be self-evident 
 ek samyavaadee samaaj kii visheshta yah hai ki usamen upbhog kii chizon kii mukt abhigamyata ke saath, utpaadan ke sadhano kaa aam swaamitv hota he or vah samaaj vargaheen va rajyaheen hota he, jisamen shram ke shoshan kaa ant anternihit ho
 The term "communist society" should be contrasted with the Western concept of "communist state", as the latter refers to a state ruled by a party claiming some form of marxism-leninism
 anya vyaktiyon ke liye harbart spencer dekhen
 Herbert Spencer was an English philosopher, zoologist, sociologist and famous traditional liberal political theorist of the Victorian period
 spencer ne bhautik vishwa, jaivik sajivon, maanav man, tathaa maanviya samskruti va samaajon kii kramik vikaas ke rup main utpatti kii ek sarv-samaveshak avadharana viksit kii
 ek bahushrut vyakti ke rup main, unhone vishyon kii ek vyapak shrenee main apana yogadan diya, jinamein nitishasre, dharm, manviki, arthshaasre, rajnatik siddhant, darshanashasre, jeev-vigyaan, samajashasre va manovigyaan shaamil hai
 During his lifetime he gained immense dominance, especially among the English-speaking academic community
 In 1902, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature
 In fact, in the United Kingdom and the United States "there was a time when Spencer's disciples could not even compare him to Aristotle!" ve "sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita " kii avadharana prastut karne ke liye sabase zyada jane jate hai, jo ki unhone charles darwin kii on da origin of spisis padhane ke baad principles of biology main prastut kii thi
 This terminology strongly suggests natural selection, but even when Spencer expanded origins into the fields of sociology and ethics, he also used Lemarkism
 wiliam jorge spencer ke putr harbart spencer kaa janm 27 april 1820 ko darbi, england main hua tha
 Spencer's father was a religious dissenter, whose leanings varied from Methodism to Quakerism, and it appeared that he transmitted all forms of power to his son
 ve johaan henrich pastalozi kii vikasparak shiksha vidhiyon ke anusaar sthapit ek vidhyalay chalaaya karte the or darbi philasofical socity ke sachiv ke rup main bhi kaary kiya karte the, jo ki san 1790 ke dashak main arasmus darwin, charles ke dada, dwaara sthapit ek vaigyanik sanstha thi
 Spencer received experimental science education from his father, while members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-darwinian concepts of biological-origin, notably Erasmus Darwin and jean-baptiste Lamarck
 His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer, pastor of the Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed his limited formal education by teaching Spencer some mathematics and physics, and a little Latin, which enabled him to translate simple texts
 Granted Thomas Spencer also left an impression on his nephew of his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political outlook
 Otherwise, Spencer was an educator who gained most of his knowledge from micro-focused studies and conversations with his friends and colleagues
 ek kishor or yuva purush donon ke rup main, spencer ne kisi bhi bauddhik yaa vyavsaayik kshetra main sthir hone main kathinaayee mahasoos kii
 san 1830 ke dashak ke dauraan rail parivahan ke kshetra main aae oochaal ke dauraan unhone ek civil ejeeniyar ke rup main kaary kiya or saath hi apana adhikansh samay prantiya patrikaon ke likhane main bhi lagaaya, jo ki apane dharm main gaiyr-anusaarak va apni raajnneeti main prajatantravaadi thim
 From 1848 to 1853, he served as assistant-editor of the free-trade magazine The Economist, during which he published his first book, Social Statistics, which predicted that humanity would eventually find the necessities of social life According to it will be completely adopted and consequently the concept of the state will be destroyed
 iske prakaashak, jon chapman, ne unhen apni sangoshtee se milwaaya, jisamen jon stuart mil, heriet martineau, jorge henry levis or mairi en ivance, jinke saath unka sankshipt romani judaav rahaa, sahit rajdhani ke anek pramukh prajatantravaadi va pragatisheel vichaarak shaamil hua karte the
 Spencer himself introduced biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who later became known as 'darwin's Bulldog' and remained his friend for a lifetime
 However, his friendship with Evans and Lewis led him to John Stuart Mill's a System of Logic and Auguste Comte's positivism and this led him on the path of his career
 He completely disagreed with Comte
 ivance or levis se unki mitra kaa pehla pratifal spencer kii agali pustak, san 1855 main prakashit principles of psychology, thi, jisamen manovigyaan ke liye ek shaareerik aadhaar kii khoj kii gai thi
 This book was based on these basic beliefs that the human mind works according to natural laws and that these could be discovered within the framework of general biology
 isane na keval vyakti ke sandarbh main, balki prajatiyon va nasl ke sandarbh main bhi, ek vikasparak drushtikon ko apnaane kii anumati di

 Spencer argued that both of these theories were partial descriptions of truth: repetitive associations of ideas involved the creation of specific fibers in brain tissue, and that they be passed from one generation to the other through the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession
 could
 unka vinamratapurvak maananaa tha ki psychology maanav-man ke liye vahi kaary karegi, jo izac newton ne padaarth ke liye kiya tha
 However, the book was not initially successful, and the final 251 copies of its first edition were not sold until June 1861
 manovigyaan main spencer kii ruchi prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ko sthapit karne kii ek adhik buniyadi chintaa se vyutpann thi
 Like others of his generation, including members of Chapman's seminar, he was obsessed with the idea of demonstrating that everything in the universe — including human culture, language, and impermanence — was interpreted by the laws of universal validity
 Could be done
 yah us samay ke anek dharamshasreiyon ke drushtikon ke vipareet tha, jinhone is baat par jor diya ki rachana ke kuch bhaag, vishishtatah maanav aatma, vaigyanik anusandhan ke kshetra se baahar the
 Comte's System de Philosophy was written with the goal of demonstrating the universality of positive natural law, and Spencer had to follow Comte to accomplish his goal
 haalanki, spencer comte ke is vishwaas se sahamat nahin the ki saarvbhaumik anuprayog kaa ek niyam dhund paanaa sambhav tha, jise unhone pragatisheel vikaas main dhundha or utpatti kaa siddhant kaha
 In 1858, Spencer created an outline, which later became the system of artificial philosophy
 This huge work, with only a small number of compositions in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the theory of origins applied to biology, psychology, sociology, and impermanence
 spencer kaa vichaar tha ki das khandon kii is rachana ko purna hone main bees varsh lagenge; ant main unhen isse duguna samay laga or isane unke lambey jivan kii lagbhag puri avadhi le lee
 Despite Spencer's early struggle to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become one of the most famous philosophers of his time
 unke jivan-kaal ke dauraan unki rachanaaon ko vyapak taur par padhaa gaya or san 1869 tak ve apana jivan-yaapan puri tarah pustakon se hone vaale laabh or victorian patrikaon main unke niyamit yogadan, jinhen esez ke teen khandon ke rup main sangrahit kiya gaya, se hone vaali aay ke dwaara kar paane main sakasham ho chuke the
 His works were translated into German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and many other languages, and he was awarded honors and awards throughout Europe and North America

 Members included physicist-philosopher John Tyndall and Darwin's cousin, banker and biologist Sir John Lubbock
 iske alaava kuch ullekhneey anuchar bhi the, jaise westominster ke dean, udaaravaadi padri arthur stanley; or charles darwin va harman won helmholtz jaise mehmaanon ko samay-samay par aamantrit kiya jaataa tha
 Through such contacts, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to create an effective audience for his approach
 In spite of his increasing wealth and fame, he never owned his own house
 spencer ke jivan ke antim dashak badhate mohabhang or akelepan se bhare hue the
 He never married and after 1855, he became an incessant diseased and constantly complained of pain and diseases, which was not diagnosed by any doctor

 In his last years his political views became conservative
 haalanki soshal statics ek aise multah prajatantravaadi kii rachana thi, jo mahilaon ko matdaan kaa adhikaar diye jane main tathaa samantshahi kii shakti ko todane ke liye bhoomi ke rashtriyakaran main vishwaas rakhata tha, lekin san 1880 ke dashak tak aate-aate ve mahila matadhikaar ke kattar virdohi ban chuke the or unhone liberty and property difens lig ke bhu-swaamiyon ke saath milakar ek saajha kaarykram main uske khilaaf yogadan kiya, jise ve wiliam ewart gladstone ke netritv main tatwon kaa 'samaajwaad' kii ore jhukaav maanate the-mukhyatah swayan gladstone kii raay ke khilaaf
 spencer ke is kaal ke rajnatik vichaar da main varses da state main vyakt kiye gaye the, jo ki unki sarvshereshth rachana ban chuki he
 An exception to Spencer's growing conservative tendency was that for a lifetime he remained a staunch opponent of militarism and imperialism
 His criticism of the Boer War was particularly damaging and contributed to his diminishing popularity in Britain
 spencer ne aadhunik paper clip ke ek purvavarti kaa avishkaar bhi kiya, haalanki yah aadhunik cotter pin kii tarah adhik dikhaai detaa tha
 This "binding pin" was distributed by Ackerman & Company
 After Appendix i of his autobiography) Spencer displays a picture of this pin as well as a published description of its experiments
 san 1902 main, apni mrityu se kuch samay purv, spencer ko sahitya ke nobel puraskaar ke liye namit kiya gaya
 unhone aaajeevan lekhan-kaary jari rakhaa, apane jivan ke antim varshon main aksar shrutlekh ke dwaara, jab tak ki 83 varsh kii aayu main ve aswasthta se parrast nahin ho gaye
 His dead body is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London, facing the grave of Karl Marx

 The basis for Spencer's attraction to many people of his generation was that he seemed to present a pre-constructed system of belief that could replace traditional religious beliefs at a time when Orthodox opinion In front of the advancement of modern science, they were shattered
 spencer kii darshanik pranali yah darshaati hui prathit hoti thi ki unnat vaigyanik avadharanaon, jaise ushmagatiki ke pratham niyam or jaivik utpatti, ke aadhaar par maanavtaa kii antim purnataa par vishwaas kar paanaa sambhav tha
 In short, Spencer's philosophical approach consisted of a combination of deism and positivism
 ek ore, unhone apane pita tathaa darbi philasofical socity ke anya sadasyon se va jorge combay kii atyadhik lokapriy da constitution of main jaisi pustakon se atharahavin sadi ke devvaad kaa kuch ansh grahan kiya tha
 In this, the universe was considered a cosmic harmony and the laws of nature were 'mercifully kind'
 is prakaar prakritik niyam susanchalit brahmad kii pratimaayein thim, jinhen srishtikarta dwaara maanviya prasannataa ko prachaarit karne ke uddeshy se nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Although Spencer renounced his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' concept of divinity, he nevertheless firmly held the concept at an almost subconscious level
 haalanki ve pratyakshvaad ko jitna shrey dete, ve usase bahut adhik grahan kar chuke the, vishesh rup se vaigyanik gyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon ke ekikaran ke rup main ek darshanik pranali ke iske nirmaan main
 ve apane is aagrah main bhi pratyakshvaad kaa paalan kar rahe the ki tathyon kaa hi vaastavik gyaan praapt kar paanaa sambhav he or isaliye antim satya ke swaroop ke bare main anumaan lagaana vyarth tha
 This tension between positivism and the rest of their Devism remained throughout the system of artificial philosophy
 vaigyanik satya ke ekikaran ke lakshya main spencer ne comte kaa anusaran kiya; isi arth main unka darshanashasre 'kritrim' hone par kendrit tha
 Like Comte, he was also committed to the universality of natural law, according to which the laws of nature apply as much to the biological field, without exception, as much as to the inert field and to the human mind
 As much as the rest of the universe
 Thus, the first purpose of artificial philosophy was to demonstrate that as natural laws, there is no exception to be able to discover scientific exploration of all the facts of the universe
 jeev-vigyaan, manovigyaan or samajashasre par spencer dwaara likhe gaye sabhi granthon kaa uddeshy in vishisht kshetron main prakritik niyamon ke astitv ko pradarshit karnaa hi tha
 Even in his writings on morality, he held the view that it was possible to find the 'rules' of impermanence, which, despite having normative content, whose state was only the laws of nature, is a concept whose origin Can be seen in Coombe's Constitution of Man
 kritrim darshanashasre kaa doosraa uddeshy yah darshana tha ki yahi niyam anwarat rup se vikaas kii ore le jate hai
 Unlike Comte, who emphasized only the unity of scientific method, Spencer attempted to unify scientific knowledge by decomposing all natural laws into one basic law, the law of origin
 is sandarbh main, unhone edinburgh ke prakaashak robert chembers dwaara unki anaam rachana vestiges of natural history of kriyeshan main prastaavit kiye gaye pratimaan kaa paalan kiya
 Although often dismissed as an ineffective precursor of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was actually a program for the integration of science, with the aim of demonstrating that Laplace's origins in the Solar System Both the nebula concept and Lemark's theory of species conversion exemplify 'an amazing generalization of progressive development' It was a battle
 chembers chapman kii sangoshtee se jude hue the or unka kaary kritrim darshanashasre ke liye ek anbhigyaat sancha bana
 The clearest expression of Spencer's evolutionary approach was first articulated in his essay, 'progress: Its Law and Cause', which was published in 1857 in Chapman's Westminster Review and later the basis of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy
 Made up
 In it, he explained the theory of evolution, combining information from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'the Theory of Life' —which itself was derived from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturephilosophy — and generalizing von Baer's law of embryonic development i went
 spencer ne yah vichaar vyakt kiya ki brahmad kii sabhi sanrachanaayen ek saral, samaan, samarupata se ek jatil, bhinn, vividhta main viksit hote hai or vibhinn bhaagon ke bade ekikaran kii prakriya bhi iske saath hi chalati rahati he
 Spencer believed that this evolutionary process could be seen working across the universe
 yah ek saarvbhaumik niyam tha, jo ki taron or akashgangaon par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna ki jaivik praaniyon par or maanviya saamaajik vyavastha par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna kii maanav-man par
 yah keval apni vyapak saamanyata ke dwaara hi vaigyanik niyamon se bhinn tha or is siddhant ke udhaaharan ke rup main vishesh vigyaan ke niyam pradarshit kiye ja sakate the
 This attempt to explain the development of complexity was completely different from the one found in Darwin's Origin of Species published two years later
 aksar kaaphi, galat tareeke se, yah mana jaataa he ki spencer ne prakritik chayan par darwin dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko keval hathiyaa liya or samanyikrut kar diya
 lekin, bhale hi darwin ke kaary ko padhane ke baad unhone darwin kii avadharana ke liye apni swayan kii shabdaawalee ke rup main vaakyansh 'sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita ' ko prastut kiya or aksar galat tareeke se unhen ek aisa vichaarak maan liya jaataa he, jisane darvinian siddhant ko samaaj par keval lagu kiya, lekin phir bhi unhone apane sampurna maujuuda tantra main prakritik chayan ko anichhaa se hi shaamil kiya tha
 His primary method of species conversion was the Lamarckist experiment-succession, which posited that organs develop or perish through organ use or application, and that these resulting changes can be transmitted to future generations as well
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii yah kaary-vidhi 'ucchtar' kramik vikaas kii vyakhya karne ke liye bhi aavashyak thi, visheshtah maanavtaa ke saamaajik vikaas ke liye
 iske alaava, darwin ke vipareet, unka maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii ek disha or ek antim-bindu tha, jo ki samatulyata kii prapti kii antim avasthaa he
 He attempted to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology
 unhone pratipaadit kiya ki samaaj nimnatar se ucchtar roopon main parivartan kaa parinaam he, thik vaise hi jaise yah kaha jaataa he ki jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ke anusaar jivan ke nimnatam rup uchachat roopon main viksit hote hai
 Spencer claimed that the human mind had evolved gradually from the simple automatic reactions of lower animals to the process of reasoning in thoughtful humans
 spencer ke anusaar gyaan ke do prakaar the: vyakti dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan tathaa prajati dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan
 antargyaan, yaa achetan rup se siikhaa gaya gyaan, prajati kaa vanshaagat anubhav tha
 Spencer studied the original positivist sociology of Auguste Comte with great enthusiasm
 vigyaan ke ek darshanik, comte ne saamaajik-saanskrithik kramik vikaas kaa ek siddhant pratipaadit kiya tha, jiske anusaar samaaj kaa vikaas teen charnon ke ek saamaanya niyam ke dwaara hota he
 However, writing after various changes in biology, Spencer attempted to reconstruct social science in the context of evolutionary biology, rejecting the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism
 mote taur par spencer ke samajashasre kaa varnan saamaajik taur par darvinvaadee ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he 
 Spencer argued that the development of society is an example of the gradual development from simple, equal, homogeneity to complex, different, diversity
 unhone samaaj ke do prakaaron, aatankwaadi tathaa audyogic, kaa ek siddhant viksit kiya, jo ki kramik vikasvaadi pragati ke anuroop tha
 The militant society, whose structure consisted of hierarchical and obedient relations, was simple and uniform; Industrial society, which was based on voluntary, contractually accepted social obligations, was complex and varied
 samaaj, jise spencer ne ek 'saamaajik praani' mana tha, kramik vikaas ke saarvbhaumik niyam ke anusaar saraltar avasthaa se adhik jatil avasthaa main kramik rup se viksit hua
 Furthermore, industrial society was a direct descendant of the ideal society developed in social statistics, although Spencer no longer explicitly expressed whether society would result in anarchism, or whether it would have informed a continued role of the state
 Is, however, a role that would have been limited to the enforcement of contracts and the minimum functions of external security
 haalanki spencer ne praarambhik samajashasre main kuch moolyawaan yogadan diye, jo ki sanrachanaatmak vyaavhaarikta par unke prabhaav se kam nahin the, lekin saamaajik vigyaan ke kshetra main lemarkwaadi yaa darvinian vichaaron ko prastut karne kaa unka prayaas vifal rahaa
 yahaan tak ki kuch logon ne to ise sakriy rup se khatarnaak bhi mana
 us samay ke vyakhyavaadi, jaise wilhem dilthi, prakritik vigyaanon or maanviya vigyaanon ke bich vibhed ke pravartak bane
 san 1890 ke dashak main, emil darkhim ne aupchaarik academik samajashasre kii sthapana kii, jisamen vyaavhaarik saamaajik anusandhan par dridhtaapurvak bal diya gaya tha
 At the turn of the twentieth century, the first generation of German sociologists, most notably Max Weber, introduced heterodox indirectism
 jaisaa ki spencer kii pehali pustak main purvanumaan kiya gaya he, 'adarsh samaaj main adarsh manushya' kaa nirmaan kramik vikaas kii prakriya kaa antim bindu hoga, jisamen manushya saamaajik jivan ko puri tarah apana chuke honge
 is prakriya ke sandarbh main spencer kii shuruaati or baad vaali avadharanaon ke bich mukhya antar inamen shaamil kramik vikaas kaa samay-maap tha
 The psychological - and hence also moral - structure that has been inherited by our ancestors to the present generation, and which we will pass on to our future generations, was in the process of progressively adopting the needs of residence in society
 udhaaharan ke liye, aakraamakata uttarjivita se judaa ek antargyaan tha, jo jivan kii praathmik sthitiyon ko aavashyak tha, lekin unnat samaajon main ise apnaanaa anaavashyak ho gaya
 chunki maanviya antargyaan kaa mastishk ke utakon ke reshon main vishisht sthaan tha, atah vah prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke adheen tha, taaki kramik parivartan bhavi pidiyon main sthanantarit kiye ja saken
 anek pidiyon ke bitne ke saath hi, kramik vikaas kii prakriya yah sunishchit karegi ki manushya kam aakraamak or vriddhishil rup se parahitvaadi bane, jiske parinamswaroop antat ek sampurna samaaj kaa nirmaan hoga, jisamen koi bhi vyakti kisi anya vyakti ko dukh nahin pahunchayegaa
 However, in order to build a complete person through gradual development, it was necessary that present and future generations experience the 'natural' consequences of their behavior
 Only in this way will individuals get the necessary motivation to do the work of self-improvement and thus provide an advanced moral formation to their heirs
 Therefore, anything that creates a disruption between the 'natural' relationship of behavior and its consequences must be stopped and this includes the exercise of the state's deterrent power to eradicate poverty, provide public education, or mandate compulsory vaccination
 haalanki, dharmarth daan ko protsaahit kiya janaa tha, lekin use bhi is vichaar ke dwaara simit kiya janaa tha ki manushyon ko dukh aksar unke kaaryon ke parinamswaroop hi praapt hote hai
 Hence, excessive altruism directed towards the 'unqualified poor' of individuals would break the link between behavior and consequences, which Spencer believed to be the basic requirement to ensure that the gradual development of humanity continues at a higher level of development
 spencer ne antim mulya kaa ek upyogvaadi maanak apanaaya-sarvaadhik sankhya kii sarvaadhik prasannataa-or unke anusaar kramik vikaas kii prakriya kaa charambindu upyogita kaa mahattam moolyankan hoga
 adarsh samaaj main rahane vaale vyakti na keval paryaaywad ke abhyaas se anand praapt karenge, balki ve dusron ko dukh pahunchane se bachane kaa bhi prayaas karenge
 ve sahaj rup se dusron ke adhikaron kaa sammaan bhi karenge, jiske parinamswaroop nyaay ke siddhant kaa vaishvik str par paalan kiya jayega-prayek vyakti ke paas swatantraaa kii vah adhiktam maatra hogi, jo dusron ko praapt swatantraaa kii samaan maatra ke saath susangat ho
 'swatantraaa' se aashay avapeedan kii anupasthiti se tha or yah nijee sampatti ke adhikaar se gaharaai se judi hui thi
 Spencer called this law of conduct 'ultimate ethics', which provided a scientifically grounded system of ethics that would replace the supernatural-based ethics systems of the past
 However, he recognized that the moral formation we inherited does not yet allow us to deal in full conformity with the laws of ultimate ethics and that is why we need a rule of 'relative ethics' In which the distortive factors of our present imperfection have also been considered
 sangieshasre par spencer kaa vishisht drushtikon bhi unke nitishasre se judaa hua tha
 Spencer thought that the origins of music can be traced to the eloquent oratory
 vaktaa pratyayakari prabhaav daalate hai, na keval unke shabdon kii tarkshiltaa ke dwaara, balki unke lahaze or swaraghaat ke dwaara bhi-jaisaa ki spencer ne ise vyakt kiya, unke swar ke sangitamay gun "buddhi ke vaakyon par bhaawanaaon kii tippanee" ke rup main kaary karte hai
 Music, considered to be an advanced development of his characteristic of oratory, contributes to the education and development of ethics of the species
 "hamaare bheetar dhun or lay se prabhavit hone kii jo vicitra kshamta he, main shaayad ye donon baaten nihit hai ki un ativ prasantaaon kaa ahsaas kar paanaa hamaare swabhaav kii sambhaavnaaon ke bheetar he, tathaa yah ki kisi na kisi tareeke se ve unki prastuti se sambandhit hai
 If so, the power and meaning of music become perceptible; But otherwise they are a mystery
 " In Spencer's final years his initial optimism appeared to be eroding and was replaced by a pessimism about the future of humans
 iske baavjood, unhone apana adhiktam prayaas apane tarkon kaa samarthan karne or gaiyr-hastkshep ke unke mahatvapurn siddhant kii galat-vyakhya ko rokane hetu samarpit kar diya
 Spencer's reputation among the Victorians is largely attributed to his agnosticism

 Spencer argued that whether we start with religious belief or with science, eventually we have to accept some essential, but literally unthinkable assumptions
 chaahe ham kisi nirmaataa ke prati chintit hon yaa us adhbstar ke prati, jo tathyon ke hamaare anubhav ke neeche sthit he, ham isaki sankalpana kaa koi khaakaa nahin khinch sakate
 spencer kaa nishkarsh tha ki isiliye, dharm or vigyaan is param satya ko sweekaar karte hai ki maanviya samaj keval 'saapeksh' gyaan ko samaj paane main hi sakasham he
 This is because, due to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to gain knowledge of the facts, not the reality below the facts
 Therefore, both science and religion should accept that 'of all the facts, it is most certain that the power we see in the universe, and is completely inaccessible

 According to a review of the JSTOR English-language database, the terminology "social Darwinism" was first used in an English-language academic journal in a book review of 1895 by Frank Tossig, a Harvard economist
 The data of JSTOR suggest that this term was used only 21 times before 1931

 Spencer's ideas became very effective in China and Japan, a big reason being that he attracted the reformers' desire to establish a powerful nation-state that could compete with Western powers
 His ideas were introduced by the Chinese scholar Yen Fu, who felt his writing was a recipe for the reform of the Qing state

 Spencer also had a great influence on literature and oratory
 In his 1852 essay, "the Philosophy of Style", a growing trend of the formist type of writing was discovered

 spencer ne tark diya ki lekhak kaa adarsh "vichaaron ko is prakaar prastut karnaa he, taaki pathak unhen nunatam sambhav maansik prayaas ke dwaara samaj sake
" He argued that by making the meaning as accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the highest possible communicative efficiency
 According to Spencer, this can be done by placing all the clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence, so that by the time the reader reaches the subject, they have already had all the information necessary to fully understand its significance
 Although the overall impact of "genre philosophy" on the field of oratory was not as widespread as his contributions to other fields, Spencer's tone lent effective support to the metaphorical approaches to oratory

 Hg Wells used Spencer's ideas as the subject of his short novel, The Time Machine, and was applied to explain the gradual evolution of humans as two species
 Perhaps the best example of Spencer's ideas and influence of writing is that his reach was so diverse

 Can any of you give your head? On hearing this, all the Sikhs present there were surprised and silence came

 Gurudev took him to a tent built nearby

 Nobody could understand anything
 tabhi tamboo se guru gobind singh kesaria bana pahane paanch sikh naujavaanon ke saath baahar aae
 The five young men were the ones whose heads Gobind Singh had taken to the tent to cut off their heads
 gurudev or paanchon noujvaan manch par aae, gurudev takht par baith gaye
 Where did the five youths take us to the tent to cut our heads, but that was our test
 tab gurudev ne vahaan upasthit sikhon se kaha aaj se ye paanchon mere panj pyaare hai
 In this way Sikhism got Panjpyaare
