 Human health depends on the natural and unnatural state of the elements from which the human body is made
 in tatwon ko unani chikitsak umoor mukabwema, yaa ajazaai mukavvema, kehete hai
 Man's existence depends on these elements
 jab tak ye tatv apni prakritik avasthaa main rahete hai, tab tak maanav sharir apana kaary niyamit rup se karata he
 This is called health

 The Greeks divided all the composition of the body into two major parts, the liquid and the non-volatile, the non-volatile constituent is not the substance
 yah dravyabhoot ghatakon ke aashray se rahanevaala unka gundharm he
 Leaving these, the liquid components remain only four, of which the basic components of the liquid liquid components are also eliminated
 ise chhod dene par keval teen dravyabhoot ghatak, akhlaat, aaza or arvaah rah jate he
 The Greeks divided all the constitutive elements of the body into three classes from the point of view: shaikhurrais ne unani vaidyak ke samast pratipaadya vishyon or unke ang pratyangon kaa apane suprasidv granth, al kanoon ke praarabhik adhyyon main vishad vivaran diya hai
 It has also been told in this book, which subjects Hakim needs to know how much and in which subjects direct, experience and testing are required
 shaikh mahoday kulliyaat kanoon kii duusari fasal maujaat tib main fermaaten hai : Since the Unani Vedic scriptures represent the human body with a view to health and unhealth, and knowledge of everything is acquired at the same time, provided that the cause of that object is, it is necessary that in Unani Vedic scripture, health And for unhealthy, their reasons should be known
 chunki swasthya tathaa unke nidaan kaaran kabhi vyakti evam prakat hote hai or kabhi avyakt evam aprakat, jo gyanedriyon se gyaat nahin kiye ja sakate pratyut unke gyaan ke liye updrav evam lakshan ke pathpradarshan kii apeksha hua karti hai, isaliye yah bhi anivaary ho gaya ki unani vaidyak shaastra main swastheavastha evam aswastheavastha main hone vaale un updravon evam lakshanon kaa ullekh kiya jaay jinase ham swasthya evam aswasthya arthath rog ke pahchaanane main samarth ho jaate hai
 In à¤‰loom Hakikia it is said that knowledge of an object is gained due to its diagnostic reasons

 There are four distinctions of Asbag in the Greek texts

 sannikrusht or viprakrusht 
 Adjacent diagnostics are limbal, ooze and air, and specific diagnoses are quadriceps and quadriplegia
 asabaab faelia ve kaaran hai, jo maanav sharir ke bheetar parirvatan karte hen, yaa unki raksha karaten hai
 Asabab Suriya has three strains: 1
 Nature, 2
 Force and 3
 Organization
 prakruti, bal or sanghathan ke yathavat rahane se bahya swasthya paaya jaataa hai
 Deformation of any one of these three causes diseases
 asbab tamaamia sharir kriyaayein hai
 The following subjects are described in the Sutra Unani Vaidyakas: superlative nature, dosha, abhinavarava, samyamravaivya, prana and ooze, force, health and unhealthy and meditative conditions, malaise, or physical condition and underwritten diagnosis due to food, drink, air , Water, country and place, resources, erections, occupation, nature, female and mental work, non-function, various air sex, other body parts The subject matter, health protection, method of food and drink for prevention of each disease, estimation of Chesta unconscious, benefit from medicines, handicrafts and surgery
 inamen kuch to aise hai jinhen hakim ko bina tark ke maan lenaa chahie or kuch aise hai jinhen tark or yukti se sidv karnaa hota hai
 In Vaidya Shastra some subjects have been adopted from other scriptures, it is compulsory for Vaidya to accept the nature of such subjects without reason and logic
 ang pratyang or unke karm to gyanendriyon or shavchchanden evam shalyakarm se gyaat kiye jaate hai
 Sheikh says, the subjects which are necessary to know and prove in a doctor with logic and logic, are the diseases, their diagnosis, causes and their symptoms and this is how to cure the disease and how health protection can be done
 
 ye vishay aise hen ki unamem se jinka astiv spasht evam nishchit na ho, unako samay or pramaan- varnanasah tark evam yukti - se vistaarpurvak siddh karnaa aavashyak hai
 From the description of Sheikh, where we get a brief knowledge of all the representations and theories of the Greek scientist, there is also a knowledge of the subject that these ancient scholars had the tools available in that early and simple era for direct knowledge
 These industries have not taken up any matter in getting their work done with all their strength and strength
 kapitay sidvanto kaa badalanaa or vibhinn anveshak kaa vibhinn kaal main vibhinn nishkarsh par pahunchnaa, ek abaadh niyam hai
 This has always been the case with Western scientific disciplines
 jo baat ek samay akatya satya samajhi jaati thi, vah nae sadhano, upkarnon or khojon se anek baar asaty pramanit hui hai
 Even after the direct knowledge, it is possible to forget from those who perform the geoscopy, so even ancient scholars cannot escape from this rule
 apni samarthy ke anusaar prakruti ke niyamon kaa adhyayan evam nirikshan unhonen kiya
 After direct experimentation or experience, some conclusions were established, some of them proved to be false by previous experiments and experiences
 isse ham un pracheen vidwaanon ko dosha nahin de sakaten
 According to Shaikhurais, disease is done by retaliation for retribution

 Shri Arvind made an important contribution to the thinking of Indian education
 unhone sarvapratham ghoshnaa kii ki maanav sansaarik jivan main bhi daivi shakti praapt kar saktaa he
 He believed that human beings can transform their psyche into 'very psyche' and 'very human' while living a physical life and serving other human beings
 shiksha dwaara yah sambhav he
 In today's circumstances, when we are following the materialistic civilization by forgetting our ancient civilization, culture and tradition, the education philosophy of Arvind instructs us in the right direction

 In the words of Shri VR Taneja- rashtriya aandolan main lage hue vidhyaarthiyon ko shaikshik suvidhaayen pradaan karne hetu kalakatta main ek rashtriya mahavidhyalay sthapit kiya gaya

 In 1908, Shri Arvind was arrested and kept in jail for participating in the national movement

 Earlier, when he was in Baroda in 1907, a famous yogi Vishnu Bhaskar came in contact with Lele and started practicing yoga
 jail se mukt hokar ve 4 april 1910 ko pandicherry chale gayi or unhone apana jivan anant satya kii khoj main laga diya
 Through continuous practice, he developed his spiritual philosophical ideology
 shri aravind ke darshan kaa lakshya "udaatt satya kaa gyaan" he jo "samgr jivan-drushti" dwaara praapt hota he
 The overall life-vision develops when a person is absorbed or unified in the Brahman
 ishwar ke prati purna samarpan dwaara maanav `ati maanav' ban jaataa he arthath vah sat, raj va tam kii pravriti se upar uthakar gyani ban jaataa he
 In a superhuman condition, a person considers all beings as his own
 jab vyakti shaareerik, maansik tathaa atmik drushti se ekaakaar ho jaataa he to usamen daivi shakti kaa pradurbhaav hota he
 Arvind has given more emphasis on yoga practice for a holistic view of life
 yoga dwaara maansik shanti evam santosh praapt hota he
 In the view of Arvind, yoga does not mean abandoning life, but faithfully facing the problems and challenges of life, believing in divine power
 aravind kii drushti main yoga kathin asana va pranayam kaa abhyaas karnaa bhi nahin he balki ishwar ke prati nishkaam bhav se aatm samarpan karnaa tathaa maansik shiksha dwaara swayan ko daivi swaroop main parinit karnaa he
 Arvind has clarified the notion of the brain, saying that the mind-level of the brain is the mind, mind, intellect and intuition, which develop gradually
 arntagyaan main vyakti ko agyaan se sandesh praapt hote hai jo brahm gyaan ke armbh kii parichaayak he
 Arvind has given special importance to Arntigyan
 arntagyaan dwaara hi maanavtaa pragati kii vartmaan dasha ko pahaunchi he
 Therefore, Arvind insists that the teacher should not suppress the talent of his disciple by routine work
 vartmaan shiksha paddati se aravind kaa asantosh isi kaaran tha ki unamem vidhyaarthiyon kii pratibha ke vikaas kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa
 The teacher should adopt a liberal approach towards the development of the talent of the students from a psychological point of view
 aravind kii mastishk kii dharna kii parinti `atimanas' kii kalpana va uske astitv main he
 Superman is a higher level of consciousness and a form of divine self-power
 atimanas kii sthiti tak shanai: shanai: pahunchnaa hi shiksha kaa lakshya hona chahie
 According to Arvind, there are three characteristics of Indian talent - enlightenment, prolificness and intelligence
 aravind ne deshavaasiyon main inhen pracheen aadhyatmik shaktiyon ke vikaas karne kaa sandesh dekar bhartiya punarjagran karnaa chaha he
 In the words of Arvind- is prakaar shri aravind ke darshan kii charam parinti unke shaikshik darshan main hoti he
 Every philosopher is ultimately an academician because education is the dynamic side of philosophy
 jaisaa ki abhi ham dekh chuke hai - aravind ke darshan kii charam parinti unke shiksha-darshan main hui he
 He was dissatisfied with the current system of education
 unka kahana tha- This knowledge is only the beginning of new research and future activities
 ve aaj kii shiksha-paddati main bhartiya pratibha kii teen visheshtaon-aadhyatmikta, sarjanaatmakataa tathaa budhimatta- kaa hraas evam patan dekhte the
 He considered the cause of this downfall as sick spirituality
 aravind kii shiksha paddati kii sankalpana- aravind is prakaar kii shikshapaddati chaahate the jo vidhyaarthee ke gyaan-kshetra kaa vistaar kare, jo vidhyaarthiyon kii smriti, nirnayan shakti evam sarjanaatmak kshamta kaa vikaas kare tathaa jiskaa madhyam maatrubhaasha ho
 Shri Arvind was of national views, so he wanted to mold the education system according to Indian tradition
 unhone shiksha dwaara punarjagran kaa sandesh diya tha
 This renaissance should be oriented towards three directions: - pracheen aadhyatm-gyaan kii purnsthapana; Use of this spiritual knowledge in philosophy, literature, art, science and critical knowledge; And vartmaan samasyaon kaa bhartiya aatm-gyaan kii drushti se samaadhaan kii khoj tathaa aadhyatm pradhan samaaj kii sthapana
 According to Shri Arvind "the main goal of education is to be helpful in the all round development of the developing soul and to enable it to be used for higher ideals
 " arvind ke vichaar mahatma gandhi dwaara pratipaadit shiksha ke lakshyon ke samaan hai
 Arvind believed that the aim of education is to awaken a person's belief that he is capable of mental and spiritual vision and that he is coming into a state of supernaturalism
 shiksha dwaara vyakti kii anternihit bauddhik evam naitik kshamtaaon kaa sarvocch vikaas hona chahie
 Arvind believed that human beings are aligned with divine power and the goal of education is to develop this consciousness power
 isiilie ve mastishk ko 'chhathi gyanendriya' maanate the
 The purpose of education should be to teach these six senses to use them properly
 unhone kaha tha ki-"mastishk kaa ucchtam seemaa tak purna prashikshan hona chahie anyathaa balak apurna tathaa ekangi rah jaayegaa
 Therefore, the goal of education is to use superman for the integrated development of human personality
 " Regarding the course of education, Arvind wanted that instead of imparting superficial knowledge of many subjects, students should be studied only in a few selected subjects
 ve bhartiya itihaas evam samskruti ko paathyakram kaa abhinn ang maanate the kyonki unka vichaar tha ki prayek balak main itihaas bodh hota he jo parikthaon, khel va khilaunon ke madhyam se prakat hota he
 Therefore, children should develop interest towards the literature and history of their country
 aravind ke anusaar prayek vyakti main jigyaasa, khoj, vishleshan va sanshleshan karne kii pravriti hoti he
 Therefore, he used to place science in the curriculum
 vigyaan dwaara maanav prakritik vaataavaran ko samajhataa he tathaa usamen vastunisht buddhi ke vikaas hetu anushaasan aata he
 Due to giving primacy to the brain, Arvind also wanted to include the subject of psychology in the curriculum so that a 'holistic life-vision' could be developed
 isi uddeshy se ve paathyakram main darshan evam tarkshastra ko bhi sthaan dete the
 Arvind wanted to develop the child's intellectual development as well as his moral and religious development
 unki dharna thi- "maanav kii maansik pravriti naitik pravriti par aadhaarit he
 Intellectual education, devoid of moral and emotional progress, is harmful to humans
 " naitik shiksha hetu aravind guru kii pracheen bhartiya parampara ke pakshdhar the jisamen guru, shishy kaa mitra, path pradarshak tathaa sahaayak ho saktaa tha
 It is only through discipline that students can build good habits
 naitik "sansuchan vidhi" dwaara di jaani chahie jisamen guru vyaktigat adarsh jivan evam pracheen mahapurushon ke udhaaharan dwaara vidhyaarthiyon ko naitik vikaas hetu utprerit kare
 According to Arvind, teaching is a science through which changes in the behavior of students are inevitable
 unke shabdon main- "vaastavik shikshan kaa pratham siddhanth he ki kuch bhi padhaanaa sambhav nahin arthath baahar se shikshaarthi ke mastishk par koi cheez na thopi jaye
 The learning process should give proper direction to the brain activity of the learner
 " prayek vidhyaarthee ko vyaktigat abhivritti evam yogyata ke anukool shiksha deni chahie
 Students should get opportunities for development according to their tendency ie "swadharma"
 aravind 'maanas' arthath mastishk ko chhathi gyanendriya maanate the jiske vikaas par ve adhik bal dete the
 The developed psyche produces a 'subtle vision' from which an impartial attitude develops
 yoga dwaara 'chitt shuddhi' shikshan kaa lakshya hona chahie
 According to Arvind, the same teacher can do effective teaching which will develop the student through the above method
 shikshit vidhyaarthiyon ko gyanendriyon tathaa mastishk ke sahi upyog dwaara unki paryvekshan, avdhaan, nirnay tathaa samaran shakti kaa vikaas karne main sahaayta kare
 Teaching children to develop insights by developing reasoning power
 aravind shikshak kaa mahatv prakat karte hue kehete the ki- Ashok Panagariya was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2014 for his outstanding contribution in the field of medicine
