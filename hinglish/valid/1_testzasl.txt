 There is hardly any family in the world who believes in Sanatan Hindu culture, who will not be familiar with the name of Gita Press Gorakhpur
 is desh main or duniya ke har kone main ramayana, gita, veda, puraana or upanishad se lekar pracheen bharat ke rishiyon -muniyon kii kathaon ko pahunchaane kaa ek maatr shrey gita press gorakhpur ke sansthaapak bhayeeji hanuman prasad poddar ko he

 kalakatta main ye swatantraaa andolan ke krantikariyon arvind ghosh, deshbandhu chitaranjan das, pan jhabarmal sharma ke sampark main aae or azaadi andolan main kud pade
 After this, when Lokmanya Tilak and Gopalakrishna Gokhale came to Calcutta, Bhai ji came in contact with them, after which he met Gandhiji
 vir savkarkar dwaara likhe gaye '1857 kaa swatantry samar granth' se bhai ji bahut prabhavit hue or 1938 main ve vir saavarkar se milane ke liye mumbai chale aae
 In 1906, he agitated against the use of cow fat in clothes and waged a struggle to boycott foreign goods and foreign clothes
 yuvavastha main hi unhone khaadi or swadeshi vastuon kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar diya
 When Vikram Samvat came to Calcutta in 1971 to collect funds for the establishment of Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Banaras Hindu University, Bhaiji met many people and donated money for this work
 kalakatta main aazaadee andolan or krantikariyon ke saath kaam karne ke ek maamle main tatkaaleen british sarkaar ne hanuman prasad poddar sahit kai pramukh vyapaariyon ko rajdroh ke aarope main giraftaar kar jail bhej diya

 Later he moved to Mumbai under the inspiration of Jamnalal Bajaj
 yahan ve vir saavarkar, netaji subhash chandra bose, mahadev desai or krishnadas jaju jaisi vibhootiyon ke nikat sampark main aae
 In Mumbai, he organized the Agrawal youth and established the Marwari Khadi Prachar Mandal

 Then he wrote devotional songs which were published under the name of 'patra-pushp'
 mumbai main ve apane mausere bhai jaidayal goyanka ji ke gita paath se bahut prabhavit the
 Seeing his love for the Gita and the curiosity about the Gita of the people, Bhai Ji pledged that he would make Srimad Bhagavadgita available to the people at a minimum price
 phir unhone gita par ek tikaa likhi or use kalakatta ke vanik press main chhapavai
 The first edition sold five thousand copies
 lekin bhayeeji ko is baat kaa du:kha tha ki is pustak main dheron galtiyaan thi
 After this, he removed the revised version but mistakes were also repeated in it
 is baat se bhai ji ke man ko gahari thes lagi or unhone tay kiya ki jab tak apana khud kaa press nahin hoga, yah kaary aage nahin badhegaa
 Only this small resolution became the basis for the establishment of Geeta Press Gorakhpur
 unke bhai goyanka ji vyapaar tab bankuda main tha or ve gita par pravachan ke silsile main praaia: baahar hi rahaa karte the
 The problem then was where to put the press
 unke mitra ghanashyam das jalaan gorakhpur main hi vyapaar karte the
 He assured to press the press in Gorakhpur itself and give full cooperation in this work
 iske baad 29 april 1923 i0 ko gita press kii sthapana hui

 Seth Ghanshyam Das Birla also came to attend the convention
 unka yadhyapi podaar ji se purna mataiky nahin tha tathaapi vah bhaashan unhen pasand aayaa
 Expressing his response the other day, he said to Poddar ji - what are the views of people sent to you, how are we saying we are not critical of this criticism? But they are being propagated by you in the society, people believe it even to a long distance

 Seeing his religion and literature service and his popularity in Gorakhpur in the British era, the then British Collector Peddle proposed to confer him with the title of 'rai Saheb', but Bhai Ji politely declined the offer
 iske baad angrej kamishnar hobert ne `raay bahadur' kii oopaadhi dene kaa prastaav rakhaa lekin bhai ji ne is prastaav ko bhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 After the independence of the country, in consultation with Dr

 Gaurav lives in Delhi and is a big fan of Aryan Khanna
 gaurav vahaan par ek pratiyogita jeet jaataa he or vah aryan ko apana adarsh maanate rahata he
 He then goes to show her his won trophy on her birthday
 vah dilli se mumbai bina rail tikat ke safar karata he
 On Aryan's birthday, Gaurav tries to go to her house, but his guards do not let him in
 uske saath main kaam karne vaala cid kapur apane saathi abhinayta aryan kaa aalochana karte rahata he
 This makes Gaurav angry
 vah cid ko dhamkee de detaa he
 Sid puts a video of the incident on the Internet
 iske baad aryan bhi us video ko dekhtaa he
 Aryan sends his car to bring Gaurav
 lekin vahaan cid ke suraksha guard aa jate hai or gaurav vahaan se bhaag jaataa he
 But they catch him and take him to the police station
 aryan vahaan aata he or kahata he ki gaurav uskaa fain nahin he
 With this, he tells Gaurav that he should never do this now and return to his home
 gaurav apane ghar chalaa jaataa he uske baad vah aryan ke saare tasveeron ko jala detaa he
 He then thinks of taking revenge on her
 ek saal baad landan main gaurav ek sangrahalay main aryan ke naam ko kharaab karne ke liye use tabah kar detaa he
 The police arrest the real Aryan but he also gets bail
 aryan dabrovanik ravaanaa ho jaataa he
 He does not know that Gaurav is also in Dubrovnik
 gaurav apane aap ko ek kalakaar ke rup main dikhaata he or vahaan ek kaarykram main chale jaataa he
 Here Aryan speaks to his workers to look outside and later realizes that Gaurav is part of his production team
 vah puri imaarat talash letaa he, lekin tab tak gaurav vahaan se bhaag nikalataa he
 Later, when Aryan looks in the mirror, it is written in it that Gaurav has created Aryan
 aryan apane agle kaarykram ke liye ek arbapati ke shaadi main jaataa he
 There too, Gaurav takes his form like Aryan and starts dancing there with the daughter of that billionaire
 usee dauraan vah maarane lagata he
 This leaves the real Aryan out in a billionaire rage
 iskaa video puure jagah fail jaataa he or uske sabhi prashansak usase duuri banane lagate hai
 Aryan then comes to know that Gaurav is following her
 vah sabhi ko bataa detaa he ki koi uske jaisaa dikh kar logon ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa he
 After returning to India, Gaurav becomes Aryan back and destroys Aryan's house by winning his prize room
 kuch hi samay baad aryan vahaan aa jaataa he or gaurav vahaan se bhaag jaataa he
 Aryan learns from Gaurav's relatives that he can join a competition
 aryan ek yojana banaata he or gaurav jis ladki se pyaar karte rahata he, usase aryan apane aap ko gaurav bataa kar apane pyaar kaa izhaar kar detaa he
 This incident provokes pride and Aryan sees her
 gaurav vahaan se bhaagane lagata he or aryan uskaa peechha karne lagata he
 After that the fight between the two begins
 aryan use kahata he ki vah aryan banane ke jagah gaurav bane
 After this Gaurav says that he said everything but has not apologized yet
 iske baad vah pahaad se girte rahata he ki aryan use pakad letaa he
 Gaurav then replies that he will never understand her
 iske saath hi vah apana haath chhudaa letaa he
 He falls down smiling and dies
 vah marane ke baad bhi muskuraate rahata he
 After this, Aryan's name gets removed from all controversies
 lekin har baar uske agle janmdin main jab bhi vah bheed ko dekhtaa he to use gaurav dikhaai detaa he
 Production of the film began in 2014
 lekin uske baad happy new year ke nirmaan ke kaaran se taal diya gaya

 As part of the Kepler mission, the Kepler space telescope explores Earth-like planets and the possibilities of their solar system
 kepler doordarshee ne ek chakree dwiadhari tarak vyavastha kii khoj kii he
 Under this, two stars are orbiting each other and a satellite is revolving around these two

 This planet has been found in the residential area
 kepler mishan ke antargat yah pehla grah he jo apane surya ke awasaiya kshetra main paaya gaya he
 Some of the salient features of the Kepler 22b planet are as follows- pali sahitya main mukhyat: buddha dharm ke sansthaapak bhagavan buddha ke upadeshon kaa sangrah he
 But some part of it was organized or written in Buddha's lifetime, it is difficult to say
 yadhyapi tripitak main hi kuch aise ullekh milte hai jinase buddha ke jeevankaal main hi dharm ke kuch prakarnon ke vyavasthit paath kiye jane kaa pataa chalata he
 For example, there is a description in Udaan that once God himself asked a monk named Sina, how did you understand religion? In response, the monk heard 16 octaves in full voice
 isaki bhagwaan ne prashansa bhi kii
 Vinayapitaka etc
 texts use adjectives such as Bahushruta, Dharmadhar, Vinayadhar, Matrikadhar and Panchannayik, Bhanak, Sutantik, which clearly shows that the tradition of Parana, holding of the teachings of the Buddha, had been in existence since his lifetime
 is parampara ke aadhaar par buddha ke upadeshon ko suvyavasthit saahitiyik rup dene ke liye teen baar sangeetiyaan kii jane ke ullekh chullavagg, dipavansh, mahavansh aadi granthon main milte hai
 The first association took place in the Rajgriha only four months after Buddha-nirvana in which 500 monks participated, due to which he is also famous as Panchashatika
 isaki adhyakshata mahakashyap ne kii or unhone buddha ke saakshaat shishy bhikshu upali se vinay sambandhi tathaa sthavir anand se sutt sambandhi prashn puch-poochkar anya bhikshuon ke anumodan se ukt vishyon kaa sangrah kiya
 The second such type of music took place in Vaishali 100 years after Buddha Nirvana, in which 700 monks joined and that is why she became known as Saptashtika
 isamen vaishali ke bhikshuon ke aacharan main anek dosha dikhaakar unhen vinay ke viruddh tehraaya gaya or anumaanath: vinayapitak main vishesh vyavastha laai gai
 According to Buddhaghosha, by the same association, the Buddha's words were classified into Tripitaka, five bodies, nine limbs and eighty-four thousand religious bodies
 teesri sangeeti buddhanirvana ke 226 varsh pashchaat samrat ashok ke rajyakaal main patliputra main hui
 It was presided over by Moggaliputta Tiss
 yah sammelan nau maas tak chalaa or usamen buddhavachanon ko antim swaroop diya gaya
 In the meantime, Moggaliputta Tissas composed the Kathavatyu in which 18 misconceptions were dispensed with by Buddhist faiths
 is rachana ko bhi abhidhammpitak main sammilit kar liya gaya
 This music is not mentioned in Chullavagga nor in the literature of the Tibetan or Chinese Mahayana sect
 ashok ke bhabru ke lekh, jisamen saat prakarnon ke naam bhi uddhrut hai, usamen, athwa anya dharmalipiyon main aisi kisi sangeeti kaa kahin koi ullekh nahin kiya gaya
 For this reason, scholars such as Keith, Vallesar, etc
 have doubts about its historicity
 kintu riodevids, winternitz tathaa giger aadi vidwaanon ne isaki aitihaasikta sweekaar kii he
 The music, about which the ancient mentions and modern scholars are unanimous about the historicity, is the second musical of Vaishali
 in sangitiyon tathaa anya prayatnon ke falswaroop pali tripitak kaa jo swaroop praapt hua evam jis rup main vah hamen aaj uplabdh he, vah nimna prakaar he : The original Pali literature is divided into three parts, called Pitaka - "vinayapitaka", "sutpitaka" and "abhidhammapitaka"
 inamen se prayek pitak ke bheetar apane apane vishay se sambandh rakhanevaali anek choti badi rachanaaon kaa samavesh he
 These three pitas of Pali compile the thoughts and teachings of Lord Buddha in the pre-sixth century AD in a special style
 teenon pitakon main paraspar taratamya he
 The theme of the theme is Sutpitaka, in which a simple, interesting narrative style is adopted to make the teachings of God heartening to the audience
 yahan vastu ko sankshep main kehane kaa praytn nahin kiya gaya
 The aim is to make new things adaptable to the general audience and that is why the main part of the sermon has been repeated again and again
 prasangvash in sutton main tatkaaleen dharmik, saamaajik evam raajnneetik paristhitiyon kaa chithran bhi aa gaya he jo pracheen itihaas kii drushti se bada mahatvapurn he
 For example, the Buddhist contemporaries of the contemporary religions like Mankhaligosal, Pakudhikayan, Ajit Kes Kambali, Sanjay Balattiputt Niganthanatattu, etc
 and Buddhism of the religious sects promoted by them are found in Buddhist view in the Samphal Sutt, Brahmjala Sutta and Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Dighi Nikaya
 And at the same time, the rendering of Buddhist beliefs on those subjects is also found
 saamaajik chithran suttapitak main bikharaa padaa he, tathaapi khuddak nikaay ke antargat jaatakon main isaki prachur saamagree uplabdh he
 In the Sutas, the kings of the 16 districts of Magadha, Videha, Kosala, Kashi, etc
 of Buddha period are filled with mention of their interrelations and fighting and fights
 sutton ke upadeshon main jis buddha aachaar ke sanket paae jate hai, unheen kii bhikshuon ke yogya sadachaar ke niyamon ke rup main vidhi-nishedh-pranali se vyavastha vinay pitak main bhi kii gai he
 Likewise, the seeds of metaphysics embedded in sutas have been theoretically rendered in philosophical terms and interpreted in Abhidhamma Pitaka
 is paraspar aanushanbikta ke kaaran bauddhadharm kaa puraa sangopang evam suvyavasthit parigyaan bina tripitak ke avlokan ke nahin ho saktaa
 This Pali is based on the teachings of Lord Buddha himself from the point of view of Tripitaka
 uplabdh granth rachana kii drushti se i
 purv tritiy shatabdi se pashchaat kaa siddh nahin hota
 According to the Buddhist tradition, during the time of Ashoka emperor, his son Mahendra himself became a Buddhist monk and took this literature to Lanka and there he got the written form during the reign of King Battagamani in the first century AD which we find today
 tathaapi usamen aisi koi baat hamen nahin milti jo bich kii do teen shatabdiyon ke kaal main lanka kii paristhitiyon ke prabhaav ke kaaran usamen ai kahin ja sake
 The subject of the Vinayapitaka, according to his name, is to present the rules of virtuous morality of monks
 iske teen avaantar vibhaag hai - suttavibhang, khandhak or parivaar
 Suttavibhang again has two subdivisions - Mahavagga and Chullavagga
 is prakaar apane in upavibhaagon kii apeksha vinayapitak paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Sutapitaka is the most important part of Tripitaka in terms of its subject, detail and composition
 isamen aise sutton kaa sangrah kiya gaya he jo paramparanusaar yaa to swayan bhagwaan buddha ke kahe hue hai yaa unke saakshaat shishy dwaara updisht hai or jinka anumodan swayan bhagwaan buddha ne kiya he
 The Sanskrit formulation of Sutta is done
 kintu prastut sutton main sutara ke ve lakshan drushtigochar nahin hote jo sanskrit kii pracheen sutararachanaon, jaise vaidic sahitya ke shrout sutara, gruhm evam dharmasutra aadi main paae jate hai
 The special feature of the sutra is to convey more and more meanings in shortest words
 usamen punarukti kaa sarvatha abhaav avidhyman he
 But here, in contrast to the brief style, the style of elaborate lectures and repeated repetitions of key points has been adopted
 is kaaran sutt kaa sutara roopaantar uchit prathit nahin hota
 By considering, it is inferred that the meaning of the Sutta is originally from Sukta
 vedon ke ek ek prakaran ko bhi sookt hi kaha gaya he
 It is perfectly appropriate to call the rendering of one thing as Sukta
 suttapitak ke paanch bhaag hai jinhen nikaay kaha gaya hai - dighanikaay, majjhimanikaay, sanyuktanikaay, anguttaranikaay or khuddakanikaay
 The longevity is divided into three classes
 pratham silkkhandhavagg main 13 sutt hai, duusare mahavagg main 10 tathaa tisare patikavagg main 11
 Thus there are 34 suttas in longevity
 ye sutt anya nikaayon main sangruhit sutton kii apeksha vistaar main adhik lambey he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 Majjhimnikaya has 152 spans of moderate expansion divided into 15 sections - inamen se 14wein varg vibhang main 12 sutt hai or shesh sab main das-das
 There is a collection of all types of sutas in the Samyutanikayaya and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 isamen kul 56 sutt yaa sanyutt hai jo in paanch virgon main vibhajit hai - Anganwasa body has its own specialty
 isamen sutton kaa sangrah ek vyavastha ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 In the beginning there are such Sutras in which Buddha is a collection of precepts related to a numerical substance of God, followed by Sutras concerning two substances and then three, four etc
 isi kram se is nikaay ke bheetar ekakanipat, dukanipat evam tik, chatuvak, panchak, chakk, sattak, atthak, navak, dasak or ekadask in naamon ke gyaarah nipaton kaa sankalan he
 These drops are divided into reclasses, which are numbered 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 and 3
 is prakaar 11 nipaton main kul virgon kii sankhya 169 he
 There are many sutas within each class whose number is at least 7 and maximum 262 in one class
 is prakaar angutar nikaay se sutton kii sankhya 2308 he
 The Kundak body consists of 15 compositions, completely independent in terms of subject and composition, whose names are - pali tripitak ke tisare bhaag abhidhammpitak main bhagwaan buddha ke darshanatmak vichaaron kaa vishleshan or vargeekaran kiya gaya he tathaa tathvik drushti se unki suchiyaan or paribhaashaayen upasthit kii gai hai
 This Pitaka consists of the following seven texts - dhammsangani uski matika ke anusaar do bhaagon main vibhakt he
 The first part has 22 topics, in each of which three subjects are discussed
 duusare vibhaag main 100 duk hai or prayek duk main vidhaan ore nishedh rup se do do vishyon kaa prarupan kiya gaya he
 These shops are divided into 12 classes, namely - is prakaar dhammsangani ke tikon or dukon kii sankhya 122 he
 The first of these is the skilled, unskilled and uneducated theologian, which is the most important and its theme has been depicted in Chittupapad form Nyakshap and Atthadhar in these four scandals
 vibhang kii vishaywastu 18 vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 There are 216 q & A's within 23 chapters in Kathavatthu which contradict the doctrines of the opposing sects
 puggalpannati main 10 adhyay hai jinamein kramash: ek ek prakaar ke, do do prakaar ke aadi badhate kram main dasven adhyay main 10, 10 prakaar ke pudgalon arthath vyaktiyon kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 Individuals have been divided by separation, Samyak Sambuddha, each Buddha, Shayakshi, Ashakshiya, Arya, Anarya etc
 dhatukatha kii rachana kaa muladhar vibhang he, kyonki usee ke pratham teen arthath skandh, aaytan or dhaatu vibhangon kaa hi yahan adhik sookshm vivechan kiya gaya he
 For this reason, the second name of this book is also found in khamb-ayatan-dhatukatha
 granth main inhen teen kaa sambandh dharmon ke saath baitaakar bataaya gaya he
 According to Matik, these religions number 125 which are as follows - inkaa paraspar sambadh prashnottar kii style se 14 adhyyon main kiya gaya he
 Relation of religions in Yamak is explained in a contradictory style with particular subjects, and because of this couple's questionable manner, the Yamak name of this composition is meaningful
 jaise kya sabhi kushaldharm kushalmul hai? kya sabhi kushalmul kushaldharm hai? ityadi
 By this method, an attempt has been made to give a definite explanation of the terminology used in Abhidhammapitaka in Yamak
 yah rachana in 10 yamakon main vibhakt he - The basic ideology of Buddhist metaphysics has been discussed in great detail in a special style in the Puttana
 granth ke mukhya chaar bhaag hai - The relation of the 22 stanzas and the 24 suffixes of the 100 dukas referred to in Dhammasarini in these four parts is explained by the following six pieces: tik pak duk pak shop pik-dik pak-pik-dik pak and shops P
 in chah patthanon kaa purvawat chaar vibhaagon main prarupan hone se sampurna granth 24 patthanon main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The compilation of the above mentioned Tripitaka literature is often done in BC
 The third century was completed, but the creation of Pali literature continued even after that
 yadhyapi yah anupali sahitya vishay kii drushti se praaia: purnat: tripitak ke antargat gyaan kaa hi anukaran karata he, tathaapi apan swaroop evam style main samay kii gati ke anusaar usamen vikaas dikhaai detaa he
 BC Around the first century, a book called Nettpikaran was written in which the subject of Abhidhammapitaka has been discussed with some more precision
 isamen 16 haar, 5 nay or 18 mul padon ke dwaara buddha darshan kii paribhaashaon ko samajhane kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 The name of its doer is Kachchan
 isi prakaar kii ek duusari rachana isi kaal ke lagbhag kii petkopadesh he jisamen nettiprakaran kii hi vishaywastu ko kuch duusari reeti se upasthit kiya gaya he, jisamen pradhanta un chaar arya satyon kii he jo buddha ke upadeshon ke muladhar hai
 Often, the third composition of this period is milind-panho, which has its specialty in Pali literature and is also very important from historical point of view
 isamen sakal ke naresh milind or bhikshu nagsen se bich hua vaartalap varnit he
 Milind is considered to be a variation of the name of that Yavan Naresh Minadar, who b
c
 In the middle of the second century, India invaded and established its kingdom in the state of Punjab
 prastut granth ke anusaar yah raja bada vidvan or darshanik vishyon main ruchi rakhanevaala tha
 He posed many philosophical questions to the monk Nagasena, to which Nagsen has cleverly answered by affirming his beautiful illustrations
 granth main saat adhyay hai - Of these, the first three chapters are considered to be the original parts of the book
 shesh chaar adhyay peeche jode gaye prathit hote hai
 There are several reasons for this - one is the information about the restart of the book in the third chapter; Secondly, the incarnation of Buddhaghosha is usually taken from only three chapters and thirdly the Chinese translation of this book was done around 400 AD, only these three chapters are found in it
 yah rachana style main badi rochak tathaa buddha siddhant ke gyaan ke liye apane dhang kii adwitiya he
 After these compositions, the era of storytelling begins
 shrut paramparanusaar jab mahendra or sanghmitra dwaara pali tripitak lanka main pahunchaa or bauddhadharm kaa prachar badha, un mul granthon par sinhalai bhashaa main tikaa rup atthakathaayen likhi gai
 These fables are no longer available
 anumaanath: iskaa kaaran un atthakathaon kii rachana ho jane se kramash: un mul atthakathaon kaa adhyayan adhyaapan chhot janaa hi he
 The name of Acharya Buddhaghosha, the author of these new Pali chronicles, is very famous in Pali literature
 unhone jin sinhalai atthakathaon kaa ullekh kiya he tathaa jinke avataran apni atthakathaon main liye hai, unamem mukhya hai- The last four chronicles appear as special lectures on bodies or any of their subjects
 in mul atthakathaon ke abhaav main yah kahana to kathin he ki kitne ansh main buddhaghosh ne unka anukaran kiya or kitna moulik rup se kiya, tathaapi unki rachanaaon ko dekhne se spasht prathit hota he ki unhone mul atthakathaon ko apane tripitak ke vishaal gyaan dwaara bahut hi pallavit kiya hoga
 His chronicles are found on most parts of Vinayapitaka, Sutpitaka and Abhidhammapitaka, numbering 16
 in atthakathaon ke atirikt buddhaghosh kii ek vishisht rachana he visuddhimagg, jise buddha darshan kaa gyaanakosh kaha ja saktaa he
 According to Buddhaghosa himself in the eight stories, he has filled the essence of these four bodies in Visuddhimagga, Digha, Majjhim, Samyutta and Angusad
 shrut paramparanusaar unhone visuddhimagg ko apni atthakathaon se purv unki rachana ko apni yogyata siddh karne ke liye hi likhaa tha
 There are a total of 23 passages in this book
 pratham do parichchhedon kaa vishay he "samadhi" or shesh parichchhedon main "pragna" kaa vyaakhyaan kiya gaya he
 After Buddhaghosha, the tradition of storytelling was reaffirmed by his two contemporary scholars, Buddhadutt and Dhammapala
 buddhadutt ne buddhaghosh krit samantapasadika naamak vinayapitak kii atthkatha kaa saar apni uttaravinishchay or vinayavinishchay naamak do padyatmak rachanaaon main upasthit kiya tathaa buddhaghosh kii abhidhamm kii atthakathaon ke aadhaar par abhidhammavatar naamak gadhy-padya-mishrit granth kii rachana kii
 The originality in this is that where Buddhaghosha has discussed religions through the five wings of Rupa, Vedanadi, Buddhadatta has adopted this four types of classification as Chittar, Chetasik, Rupa and nirvana
he has kept this isi vargeekaran ko unhone apni rooparoop vibhaag naamak rachana main rakhaa he
 Another creation of Buddhadutt is Madhurutha Vilasini, a story of Buddhavans
 dhammpal ne saat atthakathaayen likhi he
 Buddhaghosha did not write anecdotes on the texts named Uddan, Itishutakat, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Theragatha, Therigatha and Chariapitaka under Khuddakanikaya, on which Dhammapala has written a story called Paramatthadipani
 isi prakaar nettiprakaran par atthasanvaneena or usee par linatthavannana naamak tikaa, visuddhimagg par paramatthamanjusha, buddhaghosh kii chaar nikaayon kii atthakathaon par leenatthapakasini naamak tikaa, jatakatthakatha kii tikaa tathaa buddhadutt krit madhuratthvilasini kii tikaa likhi
 The most famous of these works is his commentary
 shesh rachanaaon main koi vaishishty nahin he
 Although the above is not after the creation of Tripitaka and his stories
 yadhyapi ukt tripitak va unki atthakathaon kii rachana ke pashchaat buddhavachan ke sambandh main adhik kuch kahana shesh nahin rahaa, tathaapi is atthkatha naamak tikaa sahitya kii rachana buddhaghosh yug main baraabar hoti rahi
 Some of these compositions are as follows: anandakrit abhidhamm mul tikaa, chulldhammpal krit 'sachch sankshep', upsen krit saddhammppajotik mahanam krit sadshammppakasini, kassap krit mahvichedni or vimatichhedni, vajrabuddhi krit sammtavpasadika kii tikaa, kshem krit khemppkaran, aniruddh krit abhidhammaththsangaho paramatthavinishchay or namrupapariched, dharmashri krit khuddakasikkha or mahaswami krit mulsikkha
 From 12th century onwards, the creation of commentaries started in Magadhi language itself
 is kaary kii suvyavastha ke liye lanka naresh parakrambahu pratham ke kaal main sinhalai sthavir mahakssap dwaara ek sangeeti kii gai, jiske falswaroop samantapasadika aadi atthakathaon par deepani, manjusa, pakasini aadi naamon se aath tikaayen likhi gayi, jinamein se ab keval vinayapitak kii samantapasadika atthkatha par likhi gai saratthdipani tikaa maatr milti he
 Three other commentaries of its subject Sariputta are also found
 sumangala, saddhammajotipal, dhammakirti, buddharavikhat or meghankar - in sabhi ne bhinn-bhinn atthakathaon par tikaayen likhi he
 In these, ten commentary texts like the original Sikha Tika of Wachissar Ther alone are found
 13veen shatee main sthavir videh, buddhapriy or dharmakirti dwaara samantakutavannana aadi anek granthon kii rachana hui
 Four poetic texts are famous among the works of the 14th century - baad kii teen rachanaaon ke kartaaon ke naam agyaat hai
 After the 14th century, the field of Pali-literature-creation rose from Lanka and reached Brahmadesh
 yahan ke sahityakaron ne abhidhamm ko vishesh rup se adhyayan kaa vishay banaaya
 Some compositions of the 15th century are 16veen shatee main saddhammalankar ne patthan prakaran par patthandipani naamak tikaa likhi tathaa mahanam se anandakrit abhidhamm-mul-tikaa par madhusaaraty dipani naamak anutika likhi
 In the 17th century, Tripitakalankar composed the three texts on the eightyasalini, Visastivanna, the commentary on the Sariputitika Vinayasagraha called Vinayalankara and Yasavaddhanavatthu
 trilokguru ne chaar granth rache- The other two compositions of this Shati are the Dhatukthayajana by Saradassi and Abhidhammatthaganthipada by Mahakasap
 18veen shatee kii gnanamivanshnamak brahmdes ke sangharaaj kii teen rachanaayen prasiddh hai- Some of the creations of the 19th century Brahmadesh- Nalatdhatu Vans, Sandes Katha Boundedism, decision etc
 is shatee ke chhakesadhatuvans, gandhavans or sasanavans naamak rachanaaon kaa parichay vans sahitya ke antargat diya gaya he
 Other notable works of this century are the monk Ledisdav's Abhidhammamsarah's Paratthadipani Tika and the Pali essay on Yamak which he wrote to address some of Mrs Raise Davids's doubts
 pali-sahitya-rachana kii avichhinn dhara ke pramanswaroop 20veen shatee kii do rachanaaon kaa ullekh karnaa anuchit na hoga
 These are Visuddhimagdipika composed by Bhandat Dharmanand Kosambi and Navneet Tika of Abhidhammatthasangra in India
 is parichay ke aadhaar se kaha ja saktaa he ki paalisahitya-nirmaan kii dhara dhai hajaar varsh ke pashchaat bhi abhi tak vicchhinn nahin hui
 At the time when Tripitaka was being composed in Sri Lanka, historical interest in some of the writers was aroused at the same time, resulting in the creation of Deepavansha
 in granthon main lanka kaa itihaas, pracheenatam kaal se lekar raja mahasen ke rajyakaal tak, varnan kiya gaya he
 This work has been used by Buddhaghosha abundantly in his books and has also given its revision in some places
 is prakaar dipawans kaa rachanakaal i
 chauthi paanchavin shatee ke bich siddh hota he
 Along with the kings of Sinhala, the details of the life of Buddha, the tradition of his disciples and all the three musicians etc
 have been exaggerated
 anumaanath: iske vishay kaa aadhaar uparyukt sinhalai atthakathaayen rahi hai
 This composition is poly-prose-mixed, the style is very relaxed, the repetitions are also many and the composition is not free from defects of language, verses etc
 ye lakshan uski pracheenta ke dyotak hai or is baat ke pramaan hai ki usamen vishaywastu anek sroton se sankalit kii gai he tathaa usamen sampadakeey vyavastha laane kaa koi vishesh praytn nahin kiya gaya
 But historically in Lanka, it has a great respect from the beginning
 kaha jaataa he ki i
 5veen shatee main hi sinhal raja dhatusen ne ek varshikotsav ke avasar par rashtriya gaurav ke saath iskaa paath karaayaa
 Deepavans is naturally the oldest work in Indian historical works
 dipavansh kii rachana se kuch kaal pashchaat mahanam ke dwaara mahavansh kii rachana hui
 Its base is also the Sinhala story and the deep dynasty
 yahan vishay kaa pratipaadan dipavansh kii apeksha adhik vishad or vyavasthit he
 Language is also more refined and the style reminds us of the method of epics somewhere
 mahavansh kaa mul bhaag 37 parichchhedon kaa he or vah dipavansh ke samaan mahasen ke shasankaal par samaapt hota he
 The earliest passages, which mention the religious conditions of the country before the arrival of Buddhism in Lanka, are historically significant
 udaahranarth, pandaskamay naresh kaa rajyakaal mahendra dwaara lanka main bauddhadharm ke pravesh se 60 varsh purv tak rahaa kaha gaya he
 This king ruled for 70 years and established the city of Anuradhapura only in the 10th year of the state
 isse aage is rachana main samay-samay par parivardhan kiya gaya he
 From the 50th saga of the 37th passage to the 79th passage, the composition is Sthir Dharmakirti and gives the lineage of 78 kings from the time of Mahasena to Parakramabahu I
 mahavansh kaa yah tathaa isse aage ke pariched chulvansh kehalaata he
 The Buddhist monk, the author of 11 passages from Chulvansh 80 to 90, described the next 23 kings who came to Parakramabahu IV
 91 se 100 tak ke 10 pariched sumangala ther dwaara rache gaye or unamem bhuvnekbahu tritiy se lekar kirtishree rajsingh ke kaal tak ke 24 raajaaon kaa varnan kiya
 The propagation of Christianity in Lanka is also reported here
 aglaa 101vaan pariched sumangalacharya tathaa devarakshit dwaara rachaa gaya
 Thereafter, there is also information about the state going into the hands of the British
 mahavansh kaa antim parivadharn bhikshu pragyanand nayak dwaara 1936 main prakashit hua or isamen 1815 se 1935 i
 tak kaa lanka kaa itihaas samavisht kiya gaya he
 Thus the composition of the Mahavansha has the hand of six authors by whom the history of Lanka from Lord Buddha to about two and a half thousand years has been inscribed unceasingly
 yah granth is baat kaa bhi pratik he ki ukt deergh kaal tak lanka main pali bhashaa ko kis prakaar jivit rakhaa gaya or usamen saahitiyik rachana kii dhara ko kabhi sookhne nahin diya gaya
 Deep Vansh and Mahavansha creations awakened intense historical instincts
 parinamat: anek anya vansh naamak granth rache gaye
 Historical facts are often taken from both the above mentioned texts, but the tradition of the various themes which have been collected in them is important
 inamen vishay ko mahatv dene ke liye bahut kuch atishyoktiyon or kalpanaaon kaa bhi aashray liya gaya he, jiske kaaran kahin kahin itihasajna ko udvaig yaa ashraddha utpann hone lagati he
 The main compositions of this type are - ukt granthon main adhikansh bhaag pracheen tripitak, unki atthakathaon tathaa mahavansh ke antargat vaarta kii sakshep yaa vistaar se punrariti maatr he
 But still they have some originality of their own subject, on the basis of which we get some history of the above mentioned subjects from the Buddha period till now
 yah pali sahitya kii apni visheshta he jo sanskrit praakrit main nahin pai jaati
 Classical texts have also been composed in Pali from time to time
 vyakaran ke kshetra main kacchan or moggallan krit, vyakaran evam unki tikaayen prasiddh hai
 In 1154 AD, there is a grammar of Pali language based on the grammar of Kachchan, Saddaniti, monk of Brahmadesh
 iske teen bhaag hai- padmala, dhatumala or suttamala
 Based on this, there is a rhymed metallist called Dhatvarthadeepani, a Jinratna monk pali vyakaran vishyak anya kuch rachanaayen hai- saddhammaguru krit saddabutti, mangalakrut gandhatthee or samner dhammadassi krit vachhvachak, arievansh krit gandhabharan, brahmadesh ke narsh kychha kii putree krit vibhaktyarthprakaran, jambudhvaj krit sanvaneenanay-dipana or niruttisangah, raajaguru krit karkpupfamanjari 
 The "abhidhanappadipika" and "ekkkara Kosh" of the Pali are well-known books
 pali chand:shaastra par bhi anek rachanaayen hai, jaise vrittoday, chandovichiti or kavibharprakaran aadi
 Among them, the most famous is the Thar Sangharvikrita
 isapar vachanatvajotika naamak tikaa bhi likhi gai
 The only work on these poetic poems is the same composition - Subodhalankar

 An alternative view offered by Lee Armey on his television series Mail Call contradicts this by stating that the vehicle was designed for specific tasks and was never referred to as "general purposes" and There is absolutely no chance that the average Jeep-driver GI would have been familiar with this name

 Only two companies, American Bantam Car Company and willys-overland, responded to this request

 After rejecting an initial request from Bantam, Probst accepted the job after being called back by the military and initially went to work on 17 July 1940, working without pay
 probst ne do dinon main baintum prototip ke liye yojanaayen taiyaar kar lee or agle din vaahan kii kul laagat kaa anumaan laga liya
 On July 22, Bantam's bid was submitted with a full blueprint, with the majority of the vehicle to be manufactured from existing off-the-shelf automotive parts, and the traditional four-wheeler slick train components to be supplied by Spicer
 hast nirmit prototip kaa kaam butler, pencilvenia main puraa kiya gaya or 21 sitambar 1940 ko sena dwaara pareekshan ke liye ise camp holabrd, marilland tak drive kiya gaya

 As a result, the Ford's "pygmy" and Willys's "quad" prototype were very similar to the Bantam BRC prototype, and Spicer also supplied components of the four-wheeler driver train very similar to all three manufacturers

 Operant conditioning is sensitive to behavior, or controlled by its consequences, which is a learning process
 udharan ke liye ek bachche ko garm stove chhu se bachane ke liye yaa andar candi paane ke liye ek box kholane ko jaanane ke liye siikhaa sakate hai | iske vipareet, shastreey condishning ek sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak parinaam sanket karne ke liye ek prerana kaa kaaran banataa he ; jiske parinamswaroop vyavhaar parinaam kaa utpaadan nahin karata
 For example, rallying a child with the sight of a colored wrapper or a child's trembling with the sound of a door slam, which the angry parent signals
 kabhi kabhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai ko seekhney condishning bhi kehete he, pehle bade paimaane par ghar kaa bana paheli bakse se bhaagane kii koshish kar billiyon ke vyavhaar ko manaaya jo edward el thorandic dwaara adhyayan kiya gaya
 a cat can escape from the box by a simple reaction such as pulling a rope or pushing a pole, but cats take a long time to get out when first constrained
 
 With repeated tests ineffective reactions occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more often, so cats escaped more and more rapidly
 thorandic santoshjanak parinaam ke dwaara peechha vyavhaar doharaaya ho jate hai or apriy parinaamon kaa utpaadan he ki un doharaaya ja kii sambhaavna kam hoti he ki jo rajyon prabhaav ke apane kanoon main yah nishkarsh samanyikrut

 Human is now like the process studied by Thorndick called conditioning, through which many appear to learn simple behavior
 ve pratikul prabhaav kaa utpaadan jab ve nahin he, yaa ki jab pratikriyaaon ve ek safal parinaam ke liye netritv jab barkaraar rakhaa he or khaarij kar rahe hai, he
 This is usually without being planned by any "teacher", but conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years
 skinner ko praayah condishning ke janak ke rup main janaa jaataa he According to Skinner's proactive adaptation theory, the consequences of behavior affect the probability of action
 ek vyavhaar jiske pashchaat ek sukhadaayak uddipak judaa hua ho, uske baar-baar hone kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, lekin yadi doosraa vyavhaar kisi dandatmak uddipak se judaa ho to uske hone kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 For example, if a child reacts to a behavior by a grin, the child is more likely to react to that behavior
 lekin agar aise vyavhaar ke liye gusse kii pratikriya di jaae to us vyavhaar ke dubaara pradarshit karne kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 For example, according to Skinner, a child may develop embarrassing behavior based on the experiences present in his environment
 If the environment is reestablished, the child may become socially efficient

 Template: Corporate Finance a credit rating agency is a company that determines the creditworthiness of institutions that issue certain types of debt and the debt instruments themselves
 kuch maamalon main, antarnihit rin kii suvidhaon ko bhi shrenee di jaati he
 In most cases, the issuers of securities are companies, specific target entities, state and local governments, non-profit entities or national governments that issue securities such as debt, etc
, which can be traded in secondary markets
 is
 kisi rin kaa nirgaman karne vaali sanstha hetu saakh yogyata ke nirdhaaran ke dauraan us sanstha kii rin paatrata par dhyaan diya jaataa he or isse nirgamit, vishesh pratibhuti, par lagaayi gayi byaaj dar bhi prabhavit hoti he
 Since the 2007 / 2009 economic crisis, the credibility of such ratings has been widely questioned
 2003 main security va exange kamishan ne congress ko ek report jamaa kii jisame credit reating agenciyon kii pratispardhaa virdohi kaary pranali or byaaj sambandhi vivaadon se yukt muddon ke liye ek jaanch baitaane kii yojana ke bare main vistaarpurvak bataaya gaya tha
 For more information, see Bond Credit Rating nigamon kii credit reating kaa nirdhaaran karne vaali agenciyon main nimnlikhit sammilit hai: Credit ratings are used by investors, loan issuing institutions, investment banks, brokers, traders and the government
 credit reating sansthaaen niveshkon ke liye nivesh vikalpon ke kshetra ko vistrut kar detii hai or saapeksh rin jokhim ko maapne kaa saral or swatantra tarika detii hai; isse aam taur par bazaar kii kushalta bad jaati he or udhaar lene waalon or udhaar dene waalon donon ke hi liye laagat ghat jaati he
 As a result, the total supply of risk capital increases in the economy, which leads to powerful growth
 yah puunji bazaar ko us shrenee ke udhaar lene waalon ke liye bhi khol detii he jo aisa na hone par kul milakar puunji bazaar se baahar ho jate: jaise, choti sarkarein, haal main shuru hui companiyaan, aspataal or vishvavidhyalay ityadi
 Issuers rely on these credit ratings as an independent certification of their creditworthiness and the resulting value of the equipment they issue
 adhiktar maamalon main, ek khaas band ke jari hone par uske safal hone ke liye uske paas ek pratishthit siaare dwaara kam se kam ek reating kaa hona zaruri he band market association dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan yah kehete hai ki kai sansthagat niveshak ab is baat ko prathimakata dete hai ki kisi bhi rin nirgaman ke liye kam se kam teen reating avashya hon
 Issuers also use credit ratings for certain planned finance transactions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek bahut hi ucch credit reating vaali company joki ek jokhim purna pariyojna ko shuru karne kii ichha rakhti he, vah kuch sampatti ke saath ek vaidhanik rup se alag sanstha kaa nirmaan kar sakati he jo anusandhan kaary kaa sanchaalan karegi or uske liye uttaradaayi hogi
 This "institution with specific goals" will then issue its own debt security, taking on itself all the possible risks arising from it for funding the research work
 vishisht lakshya vaali sanstha kii reating sambhawatah bahut kam hogi or jarikarta ko jari kiye gaye band par adhik dar se pratilabh kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 However, this risk will not reduce the overall credit rating of the parent company as the SPE will be statutorily a separate entity
 iske vipareet, nimna credit reating vaali ek company acchhee sharton par udhaar paa sakati he, basharte vah ek espei bana le or apni mahatvapurn sampatiyon ko us adhinsth company ko hastantarit kar ke sangrakshit rin pratibhutiyaan jari kare
 Thus, even if his venture fails, the source will be available to the lenders as SPE
 This will also reduce the interest rate that SPE will have to pay as the outstanding loan
 ek hi jarikarta ke paas bhinn prakaar ke baandon ke liye bhinn credit reating ho sakati he
 This variation is due to the structure of the bond, such as how it is protected and the extent to which it is subordinate to other debt
 kai badi siaare sansthaaen "credit reating adwiseri services" kii suvidha detii hai, joki ek jarikarta ko aavashyak rup se is bare main salaah detii he ki vah apane band ke prastaav kii ruparekha kisi rakhe or espei sansthaaon ko yah salaah detii hai ki vah kis prakaar rin ke ek nishchit ansh ke liye aavashyak credit reating ko praapt karen
 This naturally triggers a potential conflict of interest because if the issuer agrees to follow the cra's advice regarding the design of the bond, it will be obliged to give the issuer the required rating
 kuch siaare un rin prastaavon ko reating dene se inkaar karke is sangharsh se batch jaati hai, jinke liye unase salaah kii suvidha bhi lee gayi ho
 Controllers use credit ratings as well as permit ratings for regulatory purposes
 udahaaran ke liye, banking niyantrankarta, jab unhen apni shuddh arakshit puunji kii gananaa kerani hoti he tab banking paryvekshan ke sambandh main besel cameti ke besel II samjhauton ke tahat bainkon ko kuch nishchit manyata praapt siaare, yaa "eksternal credit reating institutions"kehete hai) kii credit reating ke prayog kii anumati de saktaa he
 In the United States, The Securities and Exchange Commission allows investment banks and broker-traders to use the credit rating of "nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations" for similar purposes
 iske peeche vichaar yah he ki yadi vittiya santhaan kaa adhiktam nivesh atyadhik nakadi or atyant "surakshit" pratibhutiyon ke rup main he to bank or anya vittiya sansthaanon ko bank ke adhikaran ke virodh main apane sansthaanon kii raksha karne ke liye utani hi arakshit puunji rakhane kii aavashyaktaa na pade
 CRA ratings are also used for other business purposes
 udahaaran ke liye, yues esaisi, kuch nishchit band jarikartaaon ko band ke jarikaran ke dauraan ek laghukrit vivaran prapatr ke prayog kii anumati detaa he, basharte jarikarta purana ho, usne pehle bhi band jari kiye hon or yadi uski credit reating ek nishchit seemaa ke upar ho
 According to SEC rules it is also necessary that capital market funds are devoid of insurance) only those securities having a very high NRSRO rating
 isi prakaar, beemaa niyantrak beemaa companiyon dwaara rakhi gayi arakshit nidhi kii kaarysadhakata ke nirdhaaran ke liye credit reating kaa prayog karte hai
 Under the rules of both Basel II and SEC, the rating of any CRA cannot be used for regulatory purposes
 Rather, many types of investigative processes exist in this regard
 udahaaran ke liye, besel II nirdesh, nishchit maapdandon kaa ullekh karata hai, jin par bank niyantrakon ko kisi vishesh siaare dwaara pradutt reating ke prayog ko anumati dete samay dhyaan dena chahie
 These include "fairness," "freedom," "transparency," and others
 tab hi se kai adhikaar kshetron ke banking niyantrak is vishay par apane swayan ke charchaa patr jari karne lage hai jiske dwaara ve is tathy ko or spasht rup se samajha rahe hai ki vyavhaar main in sharton kaa prayog kis prakaar hoga
 In the United States, the recognition of NRSRO since 1975 is accepted by a "no action letter" sent by an SEC employee
 is paddati kaa anusaran karte hue, yadi ek siaare niamak uddeshyon ke liye kisi vishesh siaare kii reating kaa prayog karne kaa icchhuk he to, esaisi ke karmchaaree yah tay karne ke liye bazaar kaa shodh karenge ki us siaare kii reating kaa prayog vyapak str par hota he yaa nahin or uski reating "vishwasaneey va pramanik" he yaa nahin
 If SEC employees decide that this is the case, they will send a letter to the CRA indicating that if a governing entity is confident of the cra's rating, the SEC employee is permitted to take any action against that entity Will not give ye "no ection" patr saarvajanik kiye ja sakate hai or vah sanstha jisane vastav main iske liye anurodh kiya tha, uske atirikt anya niamak sansthaaen bhi in par vishwaas kar sakati hai
 The SEC had decided to state more clearly the parameters used during this evaluation and in March 2005 it published a proposed regulation for the same
 29 sitambar 2006 ko, america ke raashtrapati jorge dablyoo
 bush ne "credit reating riform act 2006" ke kaanoon par hastakshar bhi kiye
 According to this law, the US Security and Exchange Commission is obliged to clarify how the recognition of NRSRO is accepted, it cancels the "no action letter" and makes the recognition of NRSRO a commission decision by the employee
 Of the decision taken by it) and obliges the NRSRO to be registered by SEC and also controlled by it
 es and pi ne is aadhaar par is adhinium kaa virodh kiya ki yah vaani kii swatantraaa ke kaanoon kaa ek avaidhanik ulanghan he
 In the summer of 2007, the SEC issued regulations for the implementation of the Act, according to which rating agencies are obliged to formulate policies to prevent misuse of non-public information, disclosure of conflict of interest and sanctions against "misconduct"
 puunji nirmaan main siaare kii bhoomika ko dekhete hue, kuch sarkaron ne kai prakaar kii niamak raahaton or protsaahanon ke saath apana gharelu reating agency vyapaar chaalu karne kaa prayaas kiya
 However, it can also be counterproductive if it slows down the market mechanism by which agencies compete, by helping less capable agencies and punishing agencies that provide the means for higher quality ideas
 credit reating agenciyaan niojit vittiya lenden main bhi pramukh bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Unlike the issuance of a "specific" loan or bond, where the borrower proposes to offer a fixed return on the loan, the planned financial transaction is either a series of loans with different characteristics or a number of smaller loans of the same type
 Which have been compiled together as a series of "bundles"
 a credit rating often determines the interest rate or the value associated with a particular fraction, depending on the quality of the loan or the quality of the assets that fall under that group
 niojit vitt vyavastha main sanlagn companiyaan praayah alag-alag anshon kii sanrachana ke nirdhaaran ke liye credit reating agenciyon se salaah leti hai, jisase ki prayek ko icchit reating mil jaye
 udahaaran ke liye, ek farm rin pratibhutiyon ko jari kar kaaphi maatra main puunji udhaar lene kii ichha rakh sakati he
 However, this capital is so large that the return that investors would demand for its single issue, which would be prohibitive
 iske badale main, yah teen alag band ko jari karne kaa nishchay karata he, jinaki teen bhinn credit reating hongi- e, bibibi or bibi 
 form yah aashaa karti he ki vah e-reating vaale band par jis prabhavi byaaj kaa bhugtan karti he, vah usase kaaphi kam hoga jiskaa bhugtan ise bibi-reating vaale band ke liye karnaa hoga, lekin yah bhi ki samgr rup se, ise ugaahi gayi kul puunji ke liye jis raashi kaa bhugtan karnaa aavashyak he vah us raashi se kam hi hogi jiskaa bhugtan ise ek hi band ke madhyam se ugaahi gayi puunji ke liye karnaa padataa
 is prakaar ke lenden kii yojana banane ke baad, form kisi reating agency se yah salaah le sakati he ki prayek ansh ko kis prakaar vinyasit kiya jaye - duusare shabdon main, prayek ansh main rin kii suraksha ke liye kis prakaar kii sampatti kaa prayog kiya jaye- jisase ki vah ansh jari hone par icchit reating praapt kar sake
 It was criticized for having huge deficits in the parallel debt liability market, despite these being given top ratings by CRA entities
 For example, the losses on parallel debt obligations, valued at $ 340
7 million issued by Credit Suisse Group, reached approximately $ 125 million, while they were rated AAA or AAA by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Group
 reating agenciyon ne yah pratikriya di ki unki salaah main maatr ek "samay vishesh" kaa vishleshan hota he or vah ki ve bilkul spasht karte hai ki ve kabhi bhi kisi ansh ke liye kisi vishesh reating ke sambandh main na to koi vaada karte hai or na hi koi jimmedaari lete hai tathaa yah bhi kehete hai ki ve is baat ko bhi spasht kar dete hai ki kisi vishesh ansh se sambandhit jokhim karkon ke sambandh main paristhitiyon main koi bhi badlaav unke vishleshan kii manyata ko radd kar degaa or iske falswarup ek nayi credit reating praapt hogi
 In addition, some cras do not rate the issuance of bonds for which they have given such advice
 maamle ko or bhi jatil banaate hue, visheshkar niojit vitt lenden ke sambandh main, reating agenciyaan yah kahati hai ki unke dwaara di gayi reating, is sambhaavna par die gaye vichaar hote hai ki ek rin pratibhuti ek nishchit avadhi ke dauraan asafal ho jaaegi or ye us pratibhuti kii sthirataa par die gaye vichaar nahin hote tathaa us pratibhuti par nivesh karne yaa na karne ke sambandh main to ve bilkul bhi nirdesh nahin dete
 beete hue samay main, sarvaadhik ucch reating vaali pratibhutiyon ke pramukh lakshan kam asthirataa or ucch taralata hoti thi - duusare shabdon main, ucch reating vaale band ke mulya main dainik rup se bahut adhik parivartan nahin hota tha or ansi pratibhutiyon ke vikreta ko aasaani se kharidaar mil jate the
 However, in planned transactions in which hundreds and thousands of securities of the same type are taken together, the probability of concentrating the same type of risk also increases and it is likely that a small chance of a default occurred accidentally
 a change can also have a huge impact on that group of securities
 iskaa arth yah he ki haalanki ek reating agency apane is vichaar ke sandarbh main sahi ho sakati he ki kisi niojit utpaada main akaran kii sambhaavna bahut hi kam hoti he, us utpaada ke jokhim ke sambandh main bazaar ke rukh main chota sa bhi parivartan us utpaada ke bazaar bhav par isaki tulana main kahin adhik prabhaav daal saktaa he, iske parinaam swarup prakat rup se AAA yaa Aaa reating vaali ek pratibhuti bhi kisi akaran kii anupasthiti main bhi mulya ke maamle main dher ho sakati he
 This possibility raises a number of important regulatory issues because the use of ratings in securities and banking regulations suggests that higher ratings are associated with lower volatility and more liquidity
 credit reating agenciyon ko nimna aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa: As part of the sarbanes-oxley Act 2002, Congress passed the U
S
 Commanded the SEC to produce a report, titled Report on the Role and Function of Credit Rating Agencies in the Operation of the Securities Markets, which will detail how credit ratings are used in US regulation
 And what policy issues does this experiment raise
 kuch had tak is report ke parinaam ke rup main, june 2003 main, esaisi ne ek "concept release" jari kiya jiskaa naam reating agencis and da yuj of credit retings under da federal sicurities lau tha, joki is report main uthaaye gaye kai muddon par saarvajanik tipanni chaahati thi
 Public comments on the release of this concept were also published on the SEC website
 disambar 2004 main, da international argenisations of sicurities kamishans ne siaare sansthaaon ke liye ek aachaar samhita prakashit kii, yah anya muddon ke saath, siaare ke saamne aane vaale hit sangharshon ke nidaan ke liye banaayin gayi thi

 -- mahatma gandhi, satya ke prayog, aatmakatha The main three elements in India's ancient education system can be considered - yahi gurukul shiksha-pranali kaa mul rup he
 In the dark India of the 19th century, sage Dayanand's country was very extensive among the nobles who awakened the light of awakening
 ve yug-pravartak rishi the, jinhone shiksha, raajnneeti, samaaj-sanghathan aadi sab kshetron main nae vichaaron kaa sandesh diya
 Rishi Dayanand experienced many defects in the education system prevalent in his time and presented the ancient Arya education system
 rishi ne use 'gurukul shiksha-pranali' kaa naam diya
 There were mainly two systems of education prevalent in India during his time - one was started by the British rulers of India and the other was prevalent in the Pandit congregation according to the old tradition
 sarkaar dwaara prachlit pranali bharat ke rashtriya tathaa dharmik aadarshon kepratikul thi
 In it, the language, religion, civilization, literature and culture of India were completely ignored
 pandit mandali kii shiksha-paddati samay kii aavashyaktaaon ko purna nahin karti thi usamen vartmaan yug ke gyaan-vigyaanon ko koi sthaan praapt nahin hi tha vah paakhandon kaa poshan karti thi
 The ideals that are required for character building, celibacy, renunciation, asceticism, etc
 were not important in both systems
 rishi dayanand ne anubhav kiya ki bharat main pracheen gurukul pranali kaa punaruddhar kar in dosha ko dur kiya janaa chahie
 He presented the ideals and principles of education in the third community of 'satyarth Prakash' - Undoubtedly, the thoughts of Rishi Dayanand were very revolutionary ideas in the field of education
 rishi dayanand ke ek pramukh shishy mahatma munshi ram ne san 1897 main unhone gurukul ko prarambh karne kii aavashyaktaa ke nimnlikhit kaaran bataae - In the 19th century, two types of education were prevalent in India
 pehali paddati british sarkaar dwaara apane shashan kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye viksit kii gai sarkari skulon or vishvavidhyalayon kii pranali thi or duusari sanskrit, vyakaran, darshan aadi bhartiya vaanmay kii vibhinn vidyaon ko pracheen paramparaagat vidhi se adhyayan karne kii paathshaala paddati
 There were some serious flaws in both methods
 pehali paddati main paurasty gyanvigyaan kii ghor apeksha thi or yah sarvatha arashtriya thi
 Lord Macaulay, who was an ardent proponent of this and enforced it by his well-known memorial in 1835, believed that 'the importance of books lying in one of the almari of a good European library was equal to the entire literature of India and Arabia'
 at: sarkari shiksha paddati main bhartiya vaanmay kii ghor upeksha karte hue angreji tathaa paashchaatya sahitya or gyaan vigyaan ke adhyayan par bal diya gaya
 The main objective of this education system was, in Macaulay's words, 'to create a group of Indians who are Indian in color and blood, but English in terms of interest, temper and pickle'
 isliye yah shikshapaddati bharat ke rashtriya or dharmik aadarshon ke pratikul thi
 The second education system was the school system practiced in Panditamandali
 isamen yadhyapi bhartiya vaanmay kaa adhyayan karaayaa jaataa tha, tathaapi usamen naveen tathaa vartmaan samay ke liye aavashyak gyaan vigyaan kii ghor upeksha thi
 At that time the great need of the country was to develop a national education system in harmony with the excellent elements of both education systems while coordinating the puerile and western knowledge science
 is mahatvapurn kaary kaa sampann karne main gurukul kongdi ne bada sahyog diya
 Mahatma Munshiram, the founder of the Gurukul, was greatly influenced by the educational ideas propounded in the famous book 'satyarth Prakash' by Maharishi Dayanand, the originator of the Aryasamaj, who had extraordinary significance in the Indian cultural renaissance of the last century
 unhone 1897 main apane patr 'saddharm prachaarak' dwaara gurukul shiksha pranali ke punarudwar kaa prabal andolan aarambh kiya
 On 30 October 1898, he laid out a detailed plan for it

 Under the circumstances, he completed this daunting task in eight months with his relentless industry and unwavering loyalty
 16 may 1900 ko punjab ke gujaranvaala sthaan par ek vaidic paathshaala ke saath gurukul kii sthapana kar di gai
 But Mahatma Munshiram did not find this place suitable
 ve shukla yajurveda ke ek mantra 'uphvare girinan sangame c nadinaan
 According to Dhia Wipro Ajayat 'they wanted a place near river and mountain
 isi samay nazibabad ke dharmanishth rais munshi amansingh ji ne is kaary ke liye mahatma munshiram ji ko 1,200 bighas kaa apana kangri gram daan diya
 The Kangri land surrounded by densely forested forests on the banks of the Ganges in the Himalayas was ideal for Gurukuls
 at: yahan ghaney jangal saaf kar kuch chappar banaae gaye or holi ke din somvaar, 4 march 1902 ko gurukul gujaranvaala se kangri laayaa gaya
 The Gurukul was started in some thatched huts with 34 students
 punjab kii arya janata ke udaar daan or sahyog se iskaa vikaas teevr gati se hone laga
 Its college department started in 1907 AD
 1912 i
 main gurukul kangri se shiksha samaapt kar nikalne vaale snaatakon kaa pehla dikshant samaaroh hua
 At this time, the British government considered it a seditious institution for a long time, being completely independent from the influence of the government
 1917 i
 main vysarai lard chemzaford ke gurukul aagaman ke baad is andeh kaa nivaaran hua
 In 1921, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha decided to build Vedas, Ayurveda, Agriculture and Ordinary Colleges to expand it
 1923 i
 main mahavidhyalay kii shiksha or pariksha vishyak vyavastha ke liye ek shikshapatal banaaya gaya
 Taking inspiration from it in different parts of the country, many gurukuls following its ideals and curriculum were established

 The extraordinary Ganges floods caused severe damage to the buildings on the Ganges

 In 1935 AD, a separate Vidyasabha was organized to manage it under Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Punjab
 gurukul shiksha paddati kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai- vidhyaarthiyon kaa guruon ke sampark main, unke kul yaa parivaar kaa ang banakar rahanaa, bahmacharyapurvak saral evam tapasyamay jivan bitaana, charitranirmaan or shaareerik vikaas par bauddhik evam maansik vikaas kii bhanti puraa dhyaan dena, shiksha main sanskrit ko anivaary bananaa, vaidic vaanmay ke adhyayan par bal dena, shiksha kaa madhyak maatrubhaasha hindi ko bananaa, sanskrit, darshan, veda aadi pracheen vishyon ke adhyayan ke saath aadhunik paashchaatya gyaan vigyaan or angreji kii padhai tathaa rashtriyata kii bhaavana
 Nowadays these characteristics have become universally accepted, but at the beginning of this century all these ideas were completely revolutionary, new and original
 gurukul shiksha kii katipay visheshtaayen nimnlikhit he: From the very beginning, all subjects were taught in Hindi through Hindi medium
 vigyaan, ganit, paashchaatya darshan aadi vishay bhi hindi main hi padhaaye jate the
 When the college department opened in 1907, Hindi was also kept as a medium
