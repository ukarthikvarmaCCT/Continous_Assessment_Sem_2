 vah apana khajaana ek gupha main chhupaae rahete hai
 That magical cave opened and closed only after a specific word was uttered
 vah log 'khul ja simsim' or band ho ja simsim kehete the

 Qasim Ali asks Baba emphatically about this
 ali baba use us thili ke bare main bataa detaa he
 Qasim goes to the cave and takes a donkey with him
 taaki jitna ho sake utana sona ek baar main le aa sake
 He enters that cave with that magical word
 jaise hi vah us khajaana ko dekhtaa he, vah bahut utsahit ho jaataa he
 He forgets the word to get out in this excitement
 jab vah chor vahaan waapas aate hai, to use dekh kar use maar dete hai
 He throws his corpse out of the cave and shows everyone what the result of coming inside is
 jab uskaa bhai bahut der tak nahin aata to ali baba use khojane ke liye gupha ke paas jaataa he, jahaan use uski laash dikhti he
 Ali Baba with the help of Morgana thinks of bringing Qasim's corpse home and wants to show Qasim's death a natural death

 So that another thief sees the mark and kills everyone
 lekin us chor ko morgiana dekh leti he
 She puts that kind of mark in everyone's house
 un choron kaa makasad vifal ho jaataa he
 The next day he again goes to Baba Mustafa and lays a stone
 lekin agle din bhi morgiana ise vifal kar detii he
 Therefore the thief is killed due to his failure
 ab choro kaa sardaar aakaar ali baba ke ghar ko acchhee tarah se dekhtaa he yaad kar letaa he
 His chieftain comes as an oil merchant with his fellow thieves
 jise upachaar kii aavashyaktaa bataa kar uske ghar ruk jaataa he
 He brings with him a large pot of 38 oil
 jisamen 37 chor chupe hote hai
 He thinks that when Ali Baba falls asleep, everyone will kill him together
 lekin phir morgiana ko yah baat pataa chal jaati he or vah 37 choron ko maar detii he
 When the leader of those thieves comes to know about this, he runs away
 agle subah morgiana is bare main ali baba ko bataati he
 Ali Baba frees him from his slavery
 ali baba se iskaa badla lene ke liye un choron kaa sardaar ab ek vyapaaree ban jaataa he or ali baba ke bete ke saath mitrataa kar letaa he
 He calls her to eat dinner at Ali Baba's house
 iske baad vah chor ko morgiana pahchaan jaati he
 She keeps dancing there during that time
 vah achaanak us vyapaaree ko maar detii he
 This makes Ali Baba angry at him first
 phir jab use sachai pataa chalati he to vah apane bete ki shaadi morgiana ke saath kara detaa he
 After this, only Ali Baba knows the secret of that cave and how to use it

 Rawls Hall is a Victorian Hall at Whitecross Street, Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales, now a public library
 queen victoria ke swarna jayanti samaaroh main bhavishya ke lard langatok jon rolls ne is imaarat ko shahar ko daan kar diya tha
 The building is a Grade II listed building in the United Kingdom since October 8, 2005 and is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail
 egge pavel dwaara 1887–8 main haul kaa nirmaan 8000 pound kii keemat main jcobiyan style main karavaaya gaya tha
 The building was built to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria
 imaarat ke nirmaan main puraane laal balua pathar or forest of dean ke chaukor pattharon kaa prayog hua tha
 The Rawls family of Handre was at that time a substantial landowner and patron of the city and attended the opening of the building on 24 May 1888
 imaarat kaa dizin egge pavel, jo monmouth ke meyar champni pavel ke jyeshtha putr the, dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 The hall was given in 1888 to commemorate the Queen's birth anniversary
 varsh 1889 main imaarat main ek nayaa organ, jo wiliam sweetland dwaara dizin kiya gaya tha, joda gaya
 Many different types of paintings were also installed inside the hall in the coming years
 sitambar 1890 main ek safal lalit kala or audyogic pradarshnee ko bhawan main yojit kiya gaya tha, jiskaa soochiptr monmouth sangrahalay main abhi bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Between 1897 and 1903, Hall was used for several plays staged by actor, director and director Ben Greet
 1963 main ek organ tuner ne haul ke organ kaa nirikshan karke use bekaar ghoshit kar diya tha
 The water affected the sounding boards and the equipment was slowly falling to pieces
 yah khabar sthaneey samachar patr main bhi chhapi thi, lekin organ kam se kam teen varshon ke liye apni jagah par bana rahaa jab haul ek nrity haul ke rup main istemaal kiya gaya tha or baad main ek nite club ke rup main
 In 1992, the building was used to build the city's public library, formerly located in the Shire Hall

 The library still houses its original patrons, with photographs of the full-length John Rolls, the first Baron Langatok, his wife Lady Langatok, and his son John Rolls, the second Baron Langatok, part of the main decoration on one wall
 haalanki tal mauzek jo rolls or monmouth pratikon ko ek saath judaa hua dikhaata tha, ab duusari diwaar par pradarshit he
 The word 'nigam' is often used in theology for the union of traders
 nigam shabd nagar kaa dyotak tha, kintu kuch sthalon par yah spasht he ki nigam ek vishesh prakaar kaa nagar tha jiskaa sambandh vyapaariyon se tha
 In the larger context, the corporation comes in the sense of the settlement of the merchants who carry out the transaction - the corporate corporations used to do only this work and the non-institutional corporations used to do other things in addition
 nigam kaa upyog vyapaariyon ke samooh or sangh ke liye bhi hua he
 Some of the currencies towards the end of the fourth century, derived from Vaishali, belong to the corporation of superiority, sarthava and kulikas
 aisi mudraayen bhita se bhi praapt hui hai
 In Amravati's article 'dhanankatakas Nigamas', the corporation is used not as a city but as a consortium of traders
 nigam shabd kaa yah upyog isa purv teesri shatabdi kii ek mudra main bhi miltaa he jisamen 'shaahijitiye nigamash' lekh utkeern he
 Many words have been used in the memories for the union of traders and artisans - category, poog, gana, vrat, sangha and nigam
 ye shabd samuhik sanghathanon ke liye bina kisi antar ke saadhaaran shabdon ke rup main bhi prayukt hue hai, kintu kaal or sthaan ke bhed ke saath hi inke vishisht sankuchit arth bhi dekhne ko milte hai
 Various traditions are found in their use in memory commentaries and essay texts too
 kintu phir bhi itnaa kaha ja saktaa he ki inamen se shrenee shabd aarthik sanghathanon kaa dyotak saadhaaran shabd hote hue bhi vishesh rup se udyogon ke liye tha arthath yah ek hi udyog athwa shilp ke kaarigaron kaa sanghathan tha
 The organization of traders was often called a corporation
 brihadaaranyak upanishad main vaishyon ko 'ganashah' kaha gaya he; ve sahakaarita ke dwaara hi dhanoparjan kar sakate hai, vaiyaktik parishram se nahin; samuhik sanghathan unke liye swaabhaavik he
 In the Vedic period we find the words Gana, Vrat, Ganapati and Shrestha which were related with economic organizations in the later period
 inase samuhik sansthaaon ke vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa kaa sanket hota he
 The era of Buddha was characterized by the increasing importance of collective organizations in all fields
 aarthik jivan main bhi yah parampara dikhalaai padati he
 Evidence of the evolving form of categories is reflected in three trends during this period - hereditary occupation, localization of industries and the position of head in the name of jathak or chief
 kintu shreniyon ke samvidhan or kaarividhi kaa gyaan hamen smritiyon se hi hota he
 Probably these rules could not get a stable form during the period of Dharmasutras
 smritiyon main in niyamon kaa mahatv kramash: badhata gaya
 All the members generally had equal share, rights and responsibilities in any work done in a collective property in the category of property, loss or profit arising from it, their share and responsibility also according to the work done by the members in the organization of artisans
 Used to be determined
 shreniyon ke apane samvidhan or kaary ko sucharu rup main karne ke liye nishchit niyam the
 It was the duty of the king to follow and preserve these rules
 sangh kii sabha main yadi koi sadsy uchit kaa virodh kare, nirarthak baat kahe athwa kisi vaktaa ko bolne kaa avasar na de us samay use dandit karne kaa niyam tha
 There were 2, 3 or 5 functionaries to manage the class work
 in sanghathanon ko apane sadasyon par vyapak adhikaar praapt the
 The categories also served as the courts to decide the quarrels between the members
 shreniyon ko apane kaary main puri swatantraaa thi
 The king intervened at that stage when he saw the possibility of the category being somehow devalued
 shreniyon kii sainik shakti bhi naganya nahin thi
 a clear proof of the stability of the categories and their prestige in the society is that in order to make a virtuous act permanent, people deposited a certain amount of money with the categories, which the category managed as an interest
 shreniyon ke is prakaar bank kaa kaary karne kaa pramaan anek pracheen abhilekhon se miltaa he jinamein sabase pracheen nasik or junnar ke hai
 From a record of Mandsor, it is known that the members of the category were skilled in many other functions besides their private industry
 pracheen kaal main in sanghathanon kaa prasar or prachlan bahut adhik tha
 The number of organized trades and crafts as a category is given in the Jataka and Jain texts 'question Grammar' and 'jambudweepprajnipti', 18
 mahavastu main bhi aisi anek shreniyon ke naam ginaae gaye hai
 Records also support such a situation
 vibhinn vyavsaayon ke kitne adhik log shreniyon ke sadsy hote the iskaa kuch abhas nasik se mili 120 i
 ke ek abhilekh se hota he jo govardhan main hi tantuyon kii do shreniyon kaa ullekh karata he
 Changes in the status of categories are seen in the pre-medieval period
 unka sanghathan shithil ho chalaa tha, sadasyon par unka niyantran prabhaavapurn nahin rahaa jisase raja ko unke kaaryon main praaia: hastkshep karnaa padataa tha
 The power of the head of the category was increasing
 shreniyon ke dwaara bainkon kaa kaary kiye jane ke bhi is kaal main kam udhaaharan milte hai
 Only a few categories were later reduced to caste or sub-caste due to the weakening of the influence and control of the organization
 kai jataka kathaon main anek vyapaariyon ke dwaara samudrayatra athwa sthalayatra ke samay ek hokar kaary karne kaa ullekh aata he
 There is also discussion of Setti which was probably recognized in the court as a representative of the traders
 'divyavdaan' or 'dashakumarcharit' se vyapaariyon ke sangh kii kaarividhi or unke adhikaar or prabhaav kaa kuch ullekh miltaa he
 What is stated above in relation to the constitution and rules of the categories is also specified in the memoirs for the associations of traders
 kabhi kabhi vishisht saamagree athwa vyapaarik kaary vishesh ke vyapaariyon kaa pruthak sangh bhi hota tha
 It is known from the postures of Vaishali that there was a united union of the superioris, the Sartavahs and also the Kulikas, whose branches were spread in many cities of northern India
 shakhaon se jo patr bheje jate the unpar sammilit sangh ke saath hi shakha ke pramukh athwa kaaryvahak adhikari kii bhi mudra lagati thi
 The traders association was organized and effective even in the pre-medieval period compared to the categories
 dakshin bharat ke abhilekhon se anek shaktishaalee vyapaarik sanghon ke kaaryon kaa vivaran praapt hota he
 Their membership and scope were wide

 is samay tak desh main rogon ke sambandh main anusandhan kaary kaa aayojan karne ke liy kendriya sanstha kii aavashyaktaa prathit hone lagi thi
 As a result, in 1911, the Indian Research Fund Association was formed
 pratham vishwayuddh ke dinon main is sanstha kaa kaam praaia: ruk gaya
 In the second war, there was a shortage of more investigators and the work of the institution almost stopped
 san 1940 main bhor cameti ne chikitsa sambandhi anveshan desh bhar main karaane par bahut jor diya
 After the country became independent in August 1947, the Government of India fully understood the importance of medical research and began to pay attention to its progress and the Indian Research Association was revived as the Indian Council of Medical Research in 1948 and The task of arranging every kind of medical research in the country was handed over to him

 Another committee was formed for the investigation of malaria and filarima, which was named Malaria and Anthropoid Disease Sub Committee

 Although the investigators do their work enthusiastically, economic difficulties create obstacles in their path
 jab tak anusandhankartaaon ko aarthik chintaaon se mukt nahin kiya jaataa, ve svachhand ekaagratha se apana kaam nahin kar sakate
 Taking this fact into heart, the government has proposed a similar pay scale for investigators as university teachers

 In conclusion, it is necessary to say that it is necessary to revisit the research related to medical research in our country and take them on new avenues and in our country only by research on the proper use of the immense mental strength and warehousing available

 gopinath munde khud ek kaddavar or taqatvar netaa the, pramod mahajan kaa karishma yaa kahie naam kaa unako sahaara tha
 After all, in the Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party, everything is known as Munde
 pramod mahajan kii hatya ke baad maharashtra main bhartiya janata party ke paas gopinath munde chhod doosraa koi bada netaa nahin bachaa tha
 In such a situation, Gopinath Munde got an open ground, but his shield was broken
 munde pichhadi jati se hai or obisi main unka kaaphi vajan hai
 Munde set out to find his way in national politics
 munde rashtriya upaadhyaksh bane lekin unki jaden maharashtra main hi raheen
 The BJP with Munde's base is not with the BJP
 munde ko aam kaaryakartaaon main kaaphi samarthan tha, jisaki kaat kisi ke paas nahin thi
 He himself went to the Lok Sabha, Pramod Mahajan's daughter got a ticket, so even Munde had to chew gram
 bhartiya janata party shivasena gathbandhan ke shilpkaar ke taur par gopinath munde-pramod mahajan ko janaa jaataa hai or isi baat kaa phayda uthaakar munde phir party par dabaav banaate rahe
 Gopinath Munde was made the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha
 munde aaj bhi maharashtra bhartiya janata party ke ecchhatra netaa hai
 But Munde's dominance in Maharashtra cannot be underestimated
 apane karibiyon ko tikat dilwane kii galati munde ne jarur kii, lekin iskaa ye matlab nahin hai ki munde ke peeche janaadhar nahin hai
 Gopinath Munde is the last link after LK Advani, who retained the Shiv Sena and BJP alliance
 rajya main bahujan samaaj kaa doosraa bada netaa bhartiya janata party ke paas nahin hai
 No leader has such charisma to win elections on his own
 jepisi ke gathan kii maang ko lekar vipaksh ke hangaame ke kaaran pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne loksabhaa main bayaan de kar jepisi ke gathan kii prakriya shuru karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Gopinath Munde of Bharatiya Janata Party has been made a member from Lok Sabha in JPC
 loksabhaa main bhartiya janata party ke upanetaa gopinath munde ko sansad kii lok lekha samiti kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya he
 Munde, who was recently appointed as the deputy leader after Sushma Swaraj was made the Leader of the Opposition, will continue in the post till 30 April 2010
 bhartiya janata party rashtriya adhyaksh ne bayaan diya tha ki unki shivasena pramukh bal thakare se sidhe baat nahin ho paati
 Shiv Sena was very angry with this statement
 yahaan tak ki bhartiya janata party shivasena main daraar kii atakalein bhi lagaai jane lagi
 The relationship between the Bharatiya Janata party-shiv Sena alliance still remains in a state of disarray
 bhartiya janata party netaa gopinath munde ne shivasena pramukh bal thakare or sanjay raut se mulaakaat kii
 After the meeting, Gopinath Munde claimed that he had a strong relationship with the Shiv Sena
 isi vajah se shanivaar ko matoshri main bhartiya janata party netaaon kii bal thakare ke saath baithak hui
 After which Bharatiya Janata Party leader Munde exuded confidence that Shiv Sena has no estrangement with him
 bhartiya janata party ke varisht netaa gopinath munde ne maharashtrarajya main congress-ensipi gathbandhan ko haraane ke liye maharashtra navnirmaan sena ko saath lene kaa prastaav kiya
 Shiv Sena sources said Thackeray is aware that Munde played an important role in finalizing the Shiv shakti-bhimashakti alliance with the aim of removing the congress-ncp alliance from power
 bhartiya janata party-shivasena or arpiai kii sampann raily kii ranneeti taiyaar karne vaali baithak main munde mukhar the
 He was also instrumental in bringing Ramdas Athawale with Yuti
 maharashtra kii raajnneeti kii drushti se bhim or shiv shakti kii ekta mahatvapurn maani ja rahi he, khaas taur par rashtriya str par chal rahi uthapatak kii prishthbhumi or congress kii maujuuda sthiti main bhartiya janata party-shivasena ke liye aaj kii raily myne rakhti he
 Shiv Sena has felt the most relief from Gopinath Munde's announcement of staying in the Bharatiya Janata Party
 agar gopinath munde bhartiya janata party ko ram-ram kar dete to shivasena ko bhi jhatka lagata
 To balance the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Gopinath Munde has been the chief among the craftsmen of the Shiv sena-bhim Shakti equation
 is sameekaran kaa mumbai ke biemasi ellection ke alaava agar kahin sabase zyada asarkaarak parinaam mil saktaa he to wo keval vidarbha or marathavada hi he
 The Marathwada whose politics Munde has reached in the politics of the Center, in that Marathwada, about 25 percent of the population of Maharashtra lives
 isamen se takreeban 15 fisadi aabaadi dalit or anusuchit jati ke logon kii he
 This is the largest laboratory for the Shiv shakti-bhimashakti equation
 yahi vajah he ki gopinath munde ne ramdaas athawale kii takat ko apane saath milaane ke liye mehnat kii or usamen safal bhi hue
 In such a situation, if Munde left the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Shiv shakti-bhimashakti equation was feared to be ineffective in Marathwada
 jaankaar logon kaa maananaa he ki shivasena ke saath milakar munde ne shivshakti-bhimshakti kaa sameekaran banane ke liye mehnat hi is uddeshy se kii thi ki is baar marathavada kii zyada se zyada siten jitkar wo maharashtra bhartiya janata party main apane virodhiyon kaa munh band kar saken
 This time, Munde was activated and Ramdas brought Athawale
 varna maharashtra bhartiya janata party main prabhavi ek tabaka to aisa he jo shivasena se gathbandhan khatm kar maharashtra navnirmaan sena se gathbandhan ko praathamikta detaa he
 Munde had overcome his intention

 Rahul Gandhi's statement was shameless

 Making an uproar on this issue, Munde said that under the Workmen Compensation Act, these workers are entitled to get Rs 13 lakh
 isse ghoshit 25 lakh rupee muaavje kaa sarokaar nahin he
 They should be given separately
 iskaa arth yahi hua ki sarkaar unhen 25 lakh nahin, 12 lakh hi degi
 Munde also wanted to know from the government whether the insurance premium of the ATS officers has been paid by the government? On July 8, 2005, the government had ordered a group of ATS police officers to insure, but their premiums have not been paid, as a result, the martyred policemen have been denied insurance claims
 munde ne is baat par bhi kadi aapatti kii ki police adhikari media ko vah sari jaankaree dete hai jo sadan main bataai nahin jaati

 Bharatiya Janata Party leader Gopinath Munde said that the budget was like a fast track rail which moved forward without stopping at the stations of the poor
 bhartiya janata party netaa gopinath munde ne rail bajet 2012 kii aalochana karte kaha ki sarkaar ne badi chaalaaki se anexchar kii aad main byora chipaaya
 Where the common man was expecting relief, the Railway Minister gave the people another gift of inflation
 rail yatri ko kuch nahin mila
 Cleverly increased rail fares
 mumbai ko kuch nahin mila
 Gopinath Munde, Deputy Leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Lok Sabha, said that the railway minister had very cleverly killed the fare so that the common man would never be able to overcome it
 bajet main saamaajik or aarthik rup se pichde rajyon ko puri tarah se nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 He said that millions of passengers travel by rail every day in Mumbai but the railway minister has ignored them directly

 During the zero hour in the Lok Sabha, senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Gopinath Munde said that the drought situation in Maharashtra is very bad
 do darjan se zyada jilon main pine kaa pani tak nahin he
 The situation is worst in the eight districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada
 teen maah main sau se zyada kisaan khudakushi kar chuke hai, lekin centre kii ore se ab tak sookhaa prabhavit jilon main koi raahat kaary shuru nahin kiye gaye hai
 He said that only a dozen districts have been declared drought-hit by the Maharashtra government, while this number is more than two dozen
 centre sarkaar ko raajnneeti se upar uthakar sookhaa prabhavit jilon kaa surveykshan karakar raahat kaary shuru karne chahie
 Arrangements should be made to provide fodder, drinking water and food grains in drought affected areas
 sthiti kii bhayavahata kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisaan or kaamgaar apane jaanwaron ko katlgahon ke hawaale kar karnataka palaayan kar rahe hai
 As a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee probing India's biggest scam, he raised the voice of Hindi with great vigor and has proved with his aggressive attitude that most people of the country can understand Hindi easily
 tu ji aavanton ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye bani sanyukt sansadeey samiti ke sadsy munde ne is maamle se jude sabhi dastavej hindi main uplabdh karne kii maang kii
 He said that all the members of the committee should be provided documents in Hindi at the right time so that they can prepare to test the witnesses
 Raising the voice of Hindi, Munde also said that if he was not provided papers in Hindi, then he would not attend the committee meeting
 hindi ke paksh main aakraamak tewaron se gopinath munde ne ek bahut badi baat kah di
 Munde has said the same thing, Hindi speaking society spread all over the world for a long time
 jise karporate jagat to samaj chukaa he lekin satta pratish non main baithe log or bhashaai aadhuniktaa ke kathith moh ke shikaar log nahin samajhnaa chaahate
 The meaning of this matter of Munde is very clear
 iskaa matlab ye he ki desh ke ek bade tabake ke liye – jisamen ahindi bhashi log bhi shaamil he or saikadon saansad bhi – hindi likhnaa, padhnaa or bolnaa angreji kii tulana main zyada aasaan he
 The boycott of the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee for Hindi was not done by any Hindi-speaking person but a MP from Maharashtra, but surprisingly, this matter of Munde did not appeal to any Hindi newspaper, perhaps that is why someone from Hindi Even the newspaper did not give it a place
 hindi ke akhabaaron ke liye bhale hi ye khabar na ho lekin hindi se anuraag rakhane vaale logon ke liye ye bahut badi khabar he
 So to curse Hindi, those who do evil of Raj Akre should pat Munde's back with more power so that more people can muster up the courage to speak the truth in favor of Hindi

 unhone kaha, 'varsh 1974 jaise halaat paidaa kar die gaye hai
 'munde said,' At that time there was a problem of unemployment and poverty
 sarkaar in paristhitiyon par niyantran nahin kar pai or usne varsh 1975 main desh par apatkaal thope diya
 He said, 'A similar situation has arisen even today
 sarkaar mahangaai, bhrashtachar, naksalwad tathaa aatankwaad ko kaabo nahin kar paa rahi he
 On the second day of the executive meeting, the BJP also passed a political resolution alleging that the policies of the United Progressive Alliance government have been paralyzed
 prastaav main kaha gaya he, 'yadi aam aadmi mahasoos karata he ki uske saath dhokhaa hua he, kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai, audyogic utpaadan kam ho rahaa he, berogari bad rahi he, bhrashtachar jari he, samprag ke kushasan ke kaaran anischitata tathaa niraashaa bad rahi he to yah bhartiya janata party kii jimmedaari he ki vah logon kii in chintaaon ko dur kare or party aisa karti rahegi
