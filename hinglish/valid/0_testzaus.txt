 In mathematics, the Cauchy sequence is a sequence named in honor of Augustine Louis Cauchy, whose components form a sequential process in a random closed square of each other

 Similarly, the Cauchy sequence of rational and complex numbers can be defined

 There can be dramatic differences between individuals in terms of value judgments, even when judgments of facts are indisputable
 "is the glass half empty or half full?" The situation is the most common example of this concept
 acchhee yaa buree ke rup main is tarah kii paristhiyon ke moolyankan kii shrenee kaa varnan kramshah vyakti ke ashavad yaa nirashavad ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 Throughout history, pessimistic tendencies have influenced all main areas of thinking
 darshanik nirashavad is vichaar ke samaan he, lekin iske samroop nahin he ki jivan kaa ek nakaaratmak mulya hota he, yaa yah ki ye duniya itani adhik buree he, jitani ki sambhawatah yah ho sakati he
 Many philosophers have also found that pessimism is not a tendency, as is usually indicated by the term
 iske bajaay yah ek akatya darshanashasre he jo pratyaksh rup se pragati kii avadharana or ashavad ke vishwaas-aadhaarit daavon ko chunauti detaa he
 Arthur Schopenhauer's pessimism is based on the belief that desire is above logic as the main motivation in human thought and behavior
 shophenhover ne maanviya abhiprerana ke vaastavik sroton ke rup main bhukh, kamvasana, bacchon kii dekhbhaal karne kii aavashyaktaa or sharan-sthal va vyaktigat suraksha jaise abhiprerakon kaa ullekh kiya
 In comparison to these factors, logic is only a top-down appearance for human thought; These are the clothes that our naked desires cover when we go out in society

 Assuming the life of humans as similar to the lives of other animals, he saw the reproduction cycle as virtually a cyclical process, which continues fruitlessly and indefinitely, as long as possible to make a gradual life possible
 The necessary resources do not become too limited, in which case it is exhausted by extinction
 shophenhover ke nirashavad kaa ek mukhya ang is baat kaa purvanumaan karnaa he ki nirarthak rup se jivan ke chakra ko jari rakhaa jaae yaa vilupti kaa saamana kiya jaae
 In addition, Schopenhauer believes that sorrow is rooted in the desire for desire: because these selfish desires create a constant conflict in the world
 jaivik jivan kaa kaary sabhi ke viruddh sabhi kaa yuddh he
 Logic only serves to increase our sorrows by making us realize that if we had been given the right to choose, we would not have chosen what we have received, but ultimately it would save us from suffering or curb it

 But against the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibniz that this is the best of all possible worlds, we may even oppose seriously and honestly the proof that it is the worst of all possible worlds
 For possible means not what we may picture in our imagination, but what can actually exist and last
 Now this world is arranged as it had to be if it were to be capable of continuing with great difficulty to exist; if it were a little worse, it would be no longer capable of continuing to exist
 Consequently, since a worse world could not continue to exist, it is absolutely impossible; and so this world itself is the worst of all possible worlds
 – Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol
 II, Ch
 46
 He claimed that even a slight deterioration in the circumstances, such as a small change in the orbit of the planet, or the use of any part of an animal by its animal will result in destruction
 This world is necessarily bad and "it should not be so"
 Thus throughout, for the continuance of the whole as well as for that of every individual being, the conditions are sparingly and scantily given, and nothing beyond these
 Therefore the individual life is a ceaseless struggle for existence itself, while at every step it is threatened with destruction
 Just because this threat is so often carried out, provision had to be made, by the incredibly great surplus of seed, that the destruction of individuals should not bring about that of the races, since about these alone is nature seriously concerned
 Consequently, the world is as bad as it can possibly be, if it is to exist at all

 The Battle of the Trench, also called the Battle of the Confederates, was a 30-day siege of Yathrib by Arab and Jewish tribes
 sangheey senaaon kii takat chah sau ghodon or kuch uunton ke saath lagbhag 10,000 purushon kaa anumaan he, jabaki medinan rakshakon kii sankhya 3,000 thi
 The predominantly large-scale defenders of Medina, mainly Muslims led by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug a moat at the suggestion of Salman Persian, which, combined with the natural fortifications of Medina, rendered the Union cavalry useless, on the one hand
 From two sides
 ek baar main kai hamale karne kii ummid karte hue, sanghon ne muslim-sambhddha medinan yahudiyon, banu kuraija ko dakshin se shahar par hamalaa karne ke liye raji kiya
 However, Muhammad's diplomacy put an end to the negotiations, and broke the union against him
 suvyavasthit rakshakon, sangheey manobal ke doobane, or kharaab mausam kii sthiti ne gheraabandi ko samaapt kar diya
 The siege was a "battle of victory", in which Muslims strategically conquered their opponents while suffering from very few casualties
 musalamaanon ko haraane ke prayaas vifal rahe, or islam is kshetra main prabhaavshaalee ho gaya
 As a result, the Muslim army surrounded the territory of the Banu Quraija tribe, leading to their surrender and enslavement or execution
 haar se makka ne apana vyapaar kho diya or unki pratishtha bahut adhik ho gai
 The battle is named after the "khai" or Khandak, which was opened by Muslims in preparation for the war
 shabd khandak farsi shabd kandak kaa arab rup he 
 Salman Persian Persian advised Muhammad to dig a moat around the city
 yuddh ko kanfederates kii ladaai bhi kaha jaataa he 
 The Quran uses the term unions in Sur al-ahzab to denote the union of non-believers and Jews against Islam
 makka se nishkasana ke baad, musalamaanon ne 624 main or udhud kii ladaai main 625 main badr kii ladaai main makka kurash se ladaa
 Although the Muslims neither won nor were defeated in the Battle of Uhud, military strength was gradually increasing
 april 626 main mohammad ne duusari baar badr main 1,000 kii kuraishi sena se milane ke liye 300 purushon or 10 ghodon kii ek sena uthaai
 Although no fighting took place, the coastal tribes were influenced by Muslim power
 mohammad ne muslim vistaar ke khilaaf kai gathjod todane ke liye simit safalataa ke saath bhi koshish kii
 Nevertheless, he was unable to stop Mecca
 jaisaa ki unhone badr or uhood kii ladaai main kiya tha, muslim sena ne phir se apane virodhiyon ke khilaaf samrik tareekon kaa istemaal kiya 
 In this battle he dug a moat to render the enemy cavalry ineffective
 is ladaai kaa kaaran madina ko hamale se bachaane ke liye tha, banu nazir or banu kayanuka janajatiyon ne banu kayanuka par akraman or banu nadir par akraman ke dauraan madina se unhen nishkasit karne ke liye badla lene ke liye kuraishi ke saath gathbandhan banaaya tha
 Muslim scholar Ibn Kathir states: "the reason for the Confederates was that a group of leaders of the Banu Nadir, who were expelled by the Messenger of Allah from al-madina to Khyber, including Sallam bin Abu al-hukkayq, Sallam bin Mishkam and Qinanah bin ar-rabi 'went to Mecca where he met the leaders of the Quraysh and incited them to wage war against the Prophet " 627 ke aarambh main, banu nadir makka ke kuraishi se mulaakaat kii
 Huayy ibn Akhtab, along with other leaders of Khaybar, took the oath of allegiance with Safwan ibn Umayya in Mecca
 kanfederat senaaon kaa bada hissaa makka ke kurash dwaara ikattha kiya gaya tha, jiskaa netritv abu sufaan ne kiya tha, jinhone 4,000 foot sainik, 300 ghudsavaar or uunton par 1000-1,500 purushon ko maidan main rakhaa tha
 Banu Nadir debuted Najad's nomination
 nadir ne unhen apni fasal kaa aadha bhugtan karke banu ghatfan ko bhartee karaayaa
 This contingent, the second largest, increased the strength to about 2,000 men and 300 cavalry, led by Unina bin Hasan Fazari
 bani asad bhi tuleha asadi ke netritv main shaamil hone ke liye sahamat hue
 From Banu Sulayam, Nadir secured 700 people, although this force probably had grown so large that some of its leaders were sympathetic to Islam
 mohammad ke saath samjhauta karne vaale bani amir ne shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya
 Other tribes included Banu Mura, with 400 people led by Hars ibn Auf Muri and Banu Shuja, with 700 people led by Sufyan ibn Abd Shams
 kul milakar, sangheey senaaon kii takat, haalanki vidwaanon dwaara sahamat nahin he, anumaan he ki lagbhag 10,000 purush or chah sau ghudsavaar shaamil hai
 In January 627, the army, led by Abu Sufyan, marched on Medina
 yojana ke anusaar senaaon ne madina, dakshin se makka or purv ke anya logon kii ore badhanaa shuru kiya
 At the same time the mounted attackers from Banu Khuja left to warn Medina of the army
 banu khuja ke purush chaar dinon main mohammad pahunche, unhen ek saptaah main aane vaali sangheey senaaon kii chetavanee di
 Muhammad gathered the Medinians to discuss the best strategy to overcome the enemy
 khule main dushman se mulaakaat, or shahar ke andar unke liye intjaar kar rahaa tha donon suzav die gaye the
 Eventually, the Muslims at large opted to engage in defensive fighting by digging deeper trenches to act as a barrier along the northern front
 salmaan farsi dwaara rakshaatmak khai kii ranneeti pesh kii gai thi
 Every able Muslim in Medina, including Muhammad, contributed to digging a huge ditch in six days
 khai ko keval uttari taraf khod diya gaya tha, kyonki baaki madina chattani pahaado or pedo se ghira hua tha, jo badi senaaon ke prati abhedya the
 The ditch was excavated in chillies together with a famine
 mahilaayein or bachche aantarik shahar main chale gaye the
 The Medinians harvested all their crops early, so federal armies would have to rely on their own food reserves
 mohammad ne saalaa ke pahari ilaake main apane sainya mukhyalay kii sthapana kii or sena vahaan thi; yadi dushman khai paar kar jaataa he to yah sthiti musalamaanon ko laabh pradaan karegi
 The last army to defend the city from the invasion consisted of 3,000 men, and at the age of 14 encompassed all the inhabitants of Medina, except Banu Quraiza
 madina kii gheraabandi janvari 627 main shuru hui or 27 dinon tak chali
 Since the siege was uncommon in the Arab war, unions were not prepared to deal with the trenches opened by the Muslims
 sanghon ne ek maarg ko majaboor karne kii ummid main ghudsavaaron ke saath hamalaa karne kii koshish kii, lekin medinan itane crossing ko rokane, kathor rup se funs gaye the
 The two armies gathered on either side of the trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and poetry, supported with arrows fired from a comfortable distance
 rodinson ke anusaar, hamalaavaron main se teen or rakshakon main se paanch mrit the
 On the other hand, the crop was collected and the siege had some trouble finding food for their horses, which left no use for them in the attack
 kuraishi ke diggajon ne dedlock ke saath adheeratha main vruddhi kii
 Ikrima ibn Abi Jahan, a group of militants led by 'amr ibn' Abd Wud, attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to influence a crossing, a marsh-occupied area near the hill of Sala
 amrit ne musalamaanon ko ek dwandv ko chunauti di
 In response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent to fight by Muhammad
 jaise hi ali amrit ebn abd vud se ladane ke liye gaye the, mohammad ali ke bare main kaha, "vah sabhi vishwaason kaa avatar he jo sabhi avishvaas ke avatar ke saath muthbhed main ja rahaa he
 " donon yoddha dhul main kho gaye kyonki dwandv gahan ho gaya
 Eventually, the soldiers heard screams that indicated a decisive surge, but it was unclear which of the two was successful
 dhul se naaraa, 'allaah akbar' he, ali kii jeet kii pushti kii
 The unions were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion
 ali ne apane siddhanton ke anusaar, amrit ke ghuspaith ko peeche hatane kii ijaajat di; ali ne kabhi bhaagane vaale dushman kaa peechha nahin kiya
 The Confederate army made several other attempts to cross the ditch during the night but failed repeatedly
 yadhyapi sanghavaasi khai kii puri lambaai par apane paidal sena ko tainaat kar sakate the, lekin ve musalamaanon ko kareebi timahi main shaamil karne ke icchhuk nahin the kyonki purv main baad main haath se haath se ladane ke liye behatar mana jaataa tha
 As the Muslim army dug well behind the embankment made of earth, which was taken from the ditch and prepared to bombard the attackers with stones and arrows, any attack killed a large number
 kanfederates ne tab kai baar hamalon kaa prayaas kiya, vishesh rup se banu kuraija ko dakshin se muslimon par hamalaa karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 From the Confederates, Huayy ibn Akhtab, Khybian, leader of the exiled tribe Banu Nadir, returned to Medina seeking his support against the Muslims
 ab tak banu kuraija ne tatasth rahane ke liye apni puri koshish kii thi, or kanfederates main shaamil hone ke bare main bahut sankoch kar rahe the kyonki unhone pehle mohammad ke saath samjhauta kiya tha
 When Akhtab approached him, his leader refused to admit him
 antatt antat pravesh karne or unhen manaane main kaamyaab rahe ki muslim nishchit rup se abhibhoot honge
 The sight of the huge Confederate armies, as far as the eye could see, marched Kuraya Rai to the side of the Confederacy, climbing the land with soldiers and horses
 mohammad ke saath samjhaute ke kuraijah ke anumaanit tyaag ke samachar baahar nikle, or umr ne turant mohammad ko suchit kiya
 Such suspicion was reinforced by the movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza
 mohammad apane aacharan ke bare main chintit ho gaye, or kuraija ne gambhir sambhavit khatre ko mahasoos kiya
 Because of his agreement with the Quraiza, he did not bother to make defensive preparations along the Muslim frontier with the tribe
 kuraija main hathiyaar bhi tha: 1,500 talavaarein, 2,000 lens, kavach ke 300 suut, or 500 dhaal
 Muhammad sent three prominent Muslims to bring details of recent developments
 unhone purushon ko salaah di ki ve apane nishkarshon ko khuleam ghoshit karen, kya unhen banu kuraija ko vafaadaar hone chahie, taaki muslim senaniyon ke manobal ko badhaayaa ja sake
 However, he cautioned against spreading news of a possible breach of agreement on the part of the Qurayza, so as to avoid any terror in the Muslim ranks
 netaaon ne paaya ki samjhaute ko vastav main tyaag diya gaya tha or mohammad ke haathon banu nadir or banu kayanuka ke bhagya kii yaad dilaakar unhen kuraiza ko waapas laane ke liye vyarth sabit karne kii koshish kii gai thi
 The leaders' conclusion Muhammad was indicated in a metaphor: "adal and Qarah"
 kyonki adal or karah ke logon ne musalamaanon ko dhokhaa diya tha or unhen upyukt kshan main maar daalaa tha, isliye maududi kaa maananaa he ki roopak kaa arth he ki kuraija aisa hi karne vaala tha
 Muhammad attempted to hide his knowledge of the activities of Banu Quraija; However, rumors soon spread of a massive attack on the city of Medina from the side of the Quraysh, severely degrading the Medinense
 musalamaanon ne khud ko din main badi kathinaaiyon main paaya
 Food was running low, and the nights were cold
 neend kii kami ne maamalon ko or bhi kharaab kar diya
 So tense was that, for the first time, daily daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community
 keval raat main, jab andhere ke kaaran hamale band ho gaye, to kya ve apni niyamit puja phir se shuru kar sakate the
 According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became critical and fear was everywhere
 quran surah al-ahzab kii sthiti kaa varnan karata he: Soon after hearing rumors about Quraiza, Muhammad sent 100 people to the interior for his protection
 baad main unhone shahar kii raksha ke liye 300 ghudsavaar bheja
 The loud voices, in which the army prayed every night, caused the confusion of a large force
 sankat ne mohammad ko dikhaaya ki unke kai purush apane dhiraj kii seemaa tak pahunch gaye hai
 He sent word to Ghatafan, tried to pay for his deviation and gave him the third part of the Medina date crop when he withdrew
 haalanki ghatfan ne aadha maang kii, phir bhi ve un sharton par mohammad ke saath baatcheet karne par sahamat hue
 He consulted the leaders of Medin, before Muhammad began the order to draw up the agreement
 unhone samjhaute kii sharton ko teji se khaarij kar diya, madina kaa virodh is tarah ke apmaan ke str tak kabhi nahin dub gaya tha
 The conversation was broken
 jabaki ghatfan waapas nahin gaye the, unhone madina ke saath vaarta main pravesh karke swayan samjhauta kiya tha, or kanfedersi ke aantarik vighatan main vruddhi hui thi
 At that point, Muhammad received a visit from an Arab leader, Nuaym ibn Mas'ud, who was honored by the entire Confederacy, but who was unknown to him, secretly converted to Islam
 mohammad ne unhen sanghon ke bich vivaad paidaa karke gheraabandi samaapt karne ke liye kaha
 Nuaym then came up with a skilled stratagem
 vah pehle banu kuraija gaye or unhen baaki kanfedersi ke iraadon ke bare main chetavanee di
 If the siege fails, he said, the Confederate would not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad
 is prakaar kuraija ko sangh ke netaaon ko sahyog ke badale main bandhak ke rup main maangana chahie
 This advice touched on the fears that Quraiza had already experienced
 aglaa nuam kancedaret netaa ke abu sufaan ke paas gaya, unhen chetavanee di ki kuraija mohammad ko dosha pahunchaa tha
 He said that the purpose of the tribe is to ask the hostages for the hostages, apparently in return for cooperation, but actually to hand over to Muhammad
 is prakaar sanghatan ko ek vyakti ko bandhak ke rup main nahin dena chahie
 Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Union
 nuem kii chaturaai kaa kar gai
 After consultation, the union leaders sent Ikrima to Quraiza, signaling a united invasion of Medina
 haalanki, kuraija ne bandhakon ko guarantee ke rup main maang kii ki sangheeyta unhen registani nahin karegi
 The Confederacy, considering that the Quraysh could give Muhammad hostage, refused
 partiyon ke bich baar-baar sandesh bheje jate the, lekin prayek apni ziddee sthiti main yojit hota tha
 Abu Sufyan summoned Huayy ibn Akhtab, informing him of the reaction of Quraiza
 huyayi ko waapas le liya gaya, or abu sufaan ne unhen "gaddaar" ke rup main branded kiya
 Fearing for his life, Huayi fled to the strongholds of Quraiza

 Astronomy The study of the light, origin, structure and behavior of celestial bodies located in the universe is a matter of astronomy
 ab tak brahmad ke jitne bhaag kaa pataa chalaa he usamen lagbhag 19 arab akaash gangaaon ke hone kaa anumaan he or prayek akaash ganga main lagbhag 10 arab taare hai
 The diameter of Akash Ganga is about one lakh light years
 hamaari prithvi par aadim jeev 2 arab saal pehle paidaa hua or aadmi kaa dharti par avatan 10-20 lakh saal pehle hua
 According to scientists, the universe originated from the explosion of a superpower
 surya ek ausat tara he jiske nau mukhya grah hai, unamem se prithvi bhi ek he
 Every star in this universe is like the Sun
 bahut-se taare to aise hai jinke saamne apana surya anu ke baraabar bhi nahin thahartaa he
 Just as there are planets of the Sun and we all call them together in the name of Solar family, similarly each star has its own family
 bahut se log samajhate hai ki surya sthir he, lekin sampurna saura parivaar bhi sthaneey nakshatra pranali ke antargat prati second 13 mile kii gati se gum rahaa he
 The local constellation system is moving at a speed of 200 miles per second under Akash Ganga and the entire Akash Ganga is moving in different directions at a speed of 100 miles per second under remote external Jyotimalas

 When this is the condition of contiguous stars, then the distance between the wires located far away is such a calculation that it is difficult to say
 isi kaaran se taaraon ke bich tathaa anya lambii dooriyaan prakashavarsh main maapi jaati hai
 a light year is the distance that the distance light travels in a year at a speed of one lakh twenty six thousand thousand miles per second
 udhaaharan ke liye surya or prithvi ke bich kii duuri sava nau karod mile he, prakaash yah duuri sava aath minute main tay karata he
 Thus, the distance of the Sun from Earth was a quarter to eight light minutes
 jin taron se prakaash aath hajaar varshon main aata he, unki duuri hamane paune santalis padam mile aanki he
 But the stars are so far away that it takes millions, crores, billions of years for light to come from them
 is sthiti main hamen in duriyon ko milon main vyakt karnaa sambhav nahin hoga or na kuch samaj main hi aayega
 That's why scientists have used the unit of light year
 maan lijie, brahmad ke kisi or nakshatron aadi ke baad bahut dur dur tak kuch nahin he, lekin yah baat antim nahin ho sakati he
 If there is something after that, immediately the question arises as to how far it is and what is after it? That is why we considered this universe eternal and infinite

 Thus Hubble's observations revealed that the sky Ganges is going away from us
 habal ne yah bhi bataaya ki unki prithvi se dur hatane kii gati, prithvi se unki duuri ke anupaat main he
 Astronomers have observed the extinction of the galaxy from the telescope of a 200-inch diameter lens located at Mount Polomer Observatory

 If observers are sent to other sky Ganges, they will also find that they are the focal point of this universe, the rest of the sky Ganges are running away from us
 ab jo sahi chitra hamaare saamne aata he, vah yah he ki brahmad kaa samaan gati se vistaar ho rahaa he

 According to Newton, the transpiration force between the two bodies has an immediate effect on each other, but Einstein proved that the speed of reciprocal transpiration power cannot be as fast as the speed of light
 aakhir yahan par ainstin ne newton ke patr ko galat pramanit kiya
 People liked Einstein's theory

 According to this belief, the universe has originated from the explosion of a Mahapind and that is why the Ganges of the sky is running away from us

 Therefore, it means to say that at some time there must have been a Mahapind and due to its explosion, the Akash Ganges are running away from us

 Data from Aviation News, Aviation Week, Air International saamaanya lakshan Display asr-shasr In finance, the capital asset pricing model is used to determine the desired return rate theoretically appropriate for a capital asset when this asset is to be added to an already well-managed portfolio, and while that asset is Bad risks are known

 empirical testing main yah sanskaran adhik drudh tha tathaa siepiem kii vaishvik sweekruti main iskaa prabhavi yogadan rahaa
 Despite the advent of many modern methods of pricing and portfolio selection and arbitrage empirical flaws, CAPM is still more prevalent due to its generality and usefulness in a wide variety of circumstances
 siepiem kisi akeli parisampatti athwa parisampattiyon ke samooh kii keemat nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek model he
 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he
 Note 1: The expected market returns are often estimated by taking a geometric average of the value of historical returns in a market-portfolio
 note 2: jokhim kii gananaa hetu prayukt 'jokhim mukt pratifal dar' praayah etihasik daron kaa arithmetic ausat hota he naa ki vartmaan dar

 This is important for investors who do not have an advanced-diversified portfolio

 bazaar jokhim kaa anumaan pratibhuti bazaar rekha kii dhalaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph

 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc

 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio
 siepiem dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht sampatti ke tulanaatmak jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski apekshit vaapasi arthath samaayojan dar, kitni honi chahie
 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate
 yah prachlit anaupchaarik dharna, ki adhik jokhim lene vaale niveshak adhik pratifal kii ichha rakhte hai, ke anuroop hi he
 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements
 kisi bhi portpholio main maujuud jokhim pramukhtah do prakaar ke jokhimon kaa yoga hota he - vyavasthaatmak jokhim, jise bazaar jokhim yaa ashaakhneey jokhim bhi kaha jaataa he, tathaa avyavashthaatmak jokhim jise shaakhneey jokhim kaha jaataa he
 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context — ie its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness — as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance ie less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risky and risk free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios on the effective range: some cash with a higher return - is more efficient - rather than just a portfolio with lower returns at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is the market portfolio
 sabhi niveshkon: The bi-beta model distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta
 siepiem tathaa dwi-beta model main antar yah he ki siepiem model kii manyata he ki urdhvagami or adhigami beta ek hi hai jabaki dwi-beta model esa nahin maanata
 AC validation is rarely correct, so a bi-beta model is considered more appropriate

 Both protons and neutrons are called nucleons
 nabhik kaa vyas se ke daayre main hota he
 Almost all the mass of an atom is due to the nucleus, the contribution of electron is almost negligible
 saamanytah nabhik kii pahchaan parmaanu sankhya Z, neutron sankhya n or dravyaman sankhya a se hoti he jahaan a = z + N
 The diameter of the nucleus is of the grade of "fermi"
 inke alaava nabhik ke kai gun hote hai jaise aakaar, akruti, bandhan urja, koniya samveg or arddh-aayu ityadi
 The distribution of protons in the nucleus determines the average diameter of the nucleus, which is in the range 1−10 to 10−15 m
 nabhik kaa vyas parmaanu ke vyas 10−10 meter kii apeksha bahut kam hota he, isliye parmaanu ke bheetar nabhik bahut hi kam aaytan gherta he

 kriya ke vyapaar kaa samay suchit karne vaale kriya rup ko 'kaal' kehete hai
 There are three major distinctions of Kaal in Hindi - present tense, past tense and future tense
 vartmaan kaal The action form of tense, which indicates that the work is still present, is called present tense
 iske teen bhed hote hai- The form of the ordinary present-day process, which is not yet aware of the completion or incompleteness of the work, is called the normal present tense
 jaise- Ram goes home
 main pustak padhata hoon
 He plays the ball
 apurna vartmaankaal ke jis kriya rup dwaara yah bodh hota he ki kaary isi samay kiya ja rahaa he yaa kaary lagaataar ho rahaa he, use apurna vartmaan kaal kehete hai
 like- shyaam gend khel rahaa he
 i am eating food
 vah ghar ja rahaa he
 The verb form of the complete present tense realizes that the work has just been completed
 use purna vartmaan kaal kehete hai
 like- mohan ne kitaab padhi he
 i have eaten fruit
 usne gend kheli he
 past tense kaal ke jis kriya rup dwaara kaary ke ateet main hone kaa bodh hota he, use bhootkaal kehete hai
 The past also has three distinctions - saamaanya bhootkaal ke jis kriya rup dwaara ateet main kaary kii purnataa yaa apurnataa kaa bodh na ho, use saamaanya bhootkaal kehete hai
 like- mohan ghar gaya
 i saw the ship
 usne roti khai
 The verb form of imperfect past, which realizes that the work was not completed in the past, but continued regularly, is called imperfect past
 jaise- Mohan was walking in the ground
 main saal main ek baar ghar jaataa tha
 He was playing hockey
 purna bhootkaal ke jis kriya rup dwaara yah bodh hota he ki kaary ek nishchit samay se pehle hi puraa ho chukaa tha, use purna bhoot kehete hai
 like- padma ne nrity kiya tha
 i watched the cinema
 vah dilli gaya tha
 Future tense kaal ke jis kriya rup dwaara yah bodh hota he ki kaary aage aane vaale samay main hoga, use bhavishyat kaal kehete hai
 like- gyanu dilli jaayegaa
 Meenu will bring mango
 raju der tak padhegaa
