 Vali or Bali is a character in the Ramayana
 vah sugriv kaa bada bhai tha
 He was the king of Kishkindha and is said to be the son of Indra
 vishnu ke avatar ram ne uskaa vadh kiya
 Although Vali has been described from chapters 5 to 26 out of the 67 chapters of the book Kishkindhandak in the Ramayana, Vali has had a major role in the Ramayana, especially his slaughter
 wali ke janm ko lekar ek rochak prasang maujuud he
 It is said that Vali was the son of Indra and Arun
 indra devataaon ke raja the or arun suryadev ke sarathi
 It is believed that Surya comes in the morning in the chariot of seven white horses, which is run by Arun
 ek baar kii baat he ki kisi rishi ne surya ko yah shaap de diya ki vah prithvi ke upar prakaashmaan nahin honge
 Because the sun stopped the chariot after this, so Arun had no work
 arun kii pehle se hi swarg lok main jaakar apsaraon kaa divya nrity dekhne kii ichha rahi thi
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, she dressed as a young lady and reached heaven to watch the dance of the Apsaras
 indra, jo ki is nrity kaa anand le rahe the, ne arun rupi yuvati ko dekha or usapar mohit ho gayi
 The two met and Arun eventually gave birth to Vali
 wali kaa paalan-poshan gautam rishi kii patni ahilya ne kiya
 Monkey king wali kaa vivaah vanar vaidyaraj sushen kii putree tara ke saath sampann hua tha
 According to a legend, during the Samudra Manthan, one of the fourteen monies were nymphs
 unheen apsaraon main se ek tara thi
 Both Vali and Sushen were helping the deities in the manthan
 jab unhone tara ko dekha to donon main use patni banane kii hode lagi
 Vali stood on the right side of Tara and Sushen on his left
 tab vishnu ne faisalaa sunaaya ki vivaah ke samay kanya ke dahini taraf uskaa hone vaala pati tathaa baayin taraf kanyadan karne vaala pita hota he
 Hence Vali Tara's husband and Sushen were declared her father
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki wali ko uske pita indra se ek swarna haar praapt hua jisko brahma ne mantrayukt karke yah vardaan diya tha ki isko pahanakar vah jab bhi ranbhumi main apane dushman kaa saamana karegaa to uske dushman kii aadhi shakti ksheen ho jaayegi or wali ko praapt ho jaayegi
 For this reason Vali was almost invincible
 ramayana main aisa prasang aata he ki ek baar jab wali sandhyavandan ke liye ja rahaa tha to akaash se naarad muni ja rahe the
 When Vali greeted him, Narada told that he was going to Lanka where Lankapati Ravana organized a feast to commemorate the defeat of Devraj Indra
 chanchal swabhaav ke naarad – jinhen sarvagyaan he – ne wali se chutki lene kii koshish kii or kaha ki ab to puure brahmand main keval ravan kaa hi aadhipaty he or saare praani, yahan tak ki devatagan bhi use hi sheesh navate hai
 Vali said that Ravana has used his boon and his army to suppress those who are weak but i am not among them and you should make this point clear to Ravana
 sarvagyani naarad ne yahi baat ravan ko ja kar bataai jise sunakar ravan krodhit ho gaya
 He gave orders to prepare his army
 naarad ne usase bhi chutki lete huye kaha ki ek vanar ke liye yadi aap puri sena lekar jaayenge to aapke sammaan ke liye yah uchit nahin hoga
 Ravana immediately agreed and sat in his Pushpak plane and reached near Vali
 wali us samay sandhyavandan kar rahaa tha
 Seeing the golden radiance of Vali, Ravana got scared and tried to attack Vali from behind
 wali apni puja archana main tallin tha lekin phir bhi usne use apni punch se pakadakar or uskaa sir apane bagal main dabaakar puure vishwa main ghumaya
 He did this so that the creatures of the whole world see Ravana in this helpless state and his fear is removed from his mind
 iske pashchaat ravan ne apni paraajay sweekaar kii or wali kii ore maitri kaa haath badhaayaa jise wali ne sweekaar kar liya
 The demon named Maya had two sons - Mayavi and Dundubhi
 dundubhi mahish rupi asur tha
 The great Dundubhi was so enthralled by the mountain that he challenged Sagar Raj for a duel war
 haalaanki sagar raaj uskaa dambh vahiin khatm kar sakate the lekin unhone kaha ki aise vir se vah dwandv karne main asamarth hai tathaa dundubhi ko giriyon ke raja himavan ke paas jane ko kaha
 When Dundubhi went to Himwan, Himwan also refused to fight with him and suggested to challenge Indra's son Vali who was the king of Kishkindha
 dundubhi tab kiskindha ke dwaar main gaya or wali ko dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 Madamasta Wali first tried to convince Dumbubhi, but when he did not agree, Vali agreed to the duel and beat Dundubhi very easily and killed her
 iske pashchaat wali ne dundubhi ke nirjeev sharir ko uchhaalkar ek hi jatke main ek yojan dur phenk diya
 Droplets of blood dripping from the body fell into the hermitage of Maharishi Matang, which was located in Rishimuk mountain
 krodhit matang ne wali ko shaap de daalaa ki yadi wali kabhi bhi unke ashram ke ek yojan ke daayre main aayaa to vah mrityu ko praapt hoga
 It is also mentioned in the Kishkindha Kanda of Ramayana that the daily used to go to the west coast and north to south coasts from the east coast to offer water to the sun
 raste main ai pahaado kii chotiyon ko vah aise upar phenkata tha or punah pakad letaa tha maano vah koi gend hon
 Even after this, when he returned after sun worshiping, he did not get tired
 wali ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki yadi koi use dwandv ke liye lalakaare to vah turant taiyaar ho jaataa tha
 Dundubhi's elder brother Mayavi had a great old enmity with a woman
 mayavi ek raat kiskindha aayaa or wali ko dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 Despite the refusal of women and well-wishers, Vali ran after that demon
 saath main sugriv bhi uske saath tha
 Rushing into the elusive land, he entered a tomb
 wali bhi uske peeche-peeche gaya
 Before leaving, he ordered Sugriva to guard Sugriva by standing at the mouth of the tomb until he came back after killing the elusive
 ek varsh se adhik interval ke pashchaat kandara ke muhane se rakt bahata hua baahar aayaa
 Sugriva listened to the asura of the demon, but not the brother
 yah samajhakar ki uskaa agraj ran main maaraa gaya, sugriv ne us kandara ke munh ko ek shila se band kar diya or waapas kiskindha aa gaya jahaan usne yah samachar sabko sunaaya
 The ministers, after consulting him, crowned Sugriva
 kuch samay pashchaat wali prakat hua or apane anuj ko raja dekh bahut kupit hua
 Sugriva tried his best to convince him, but Vali did not listen to him and grabbed Sugriva's kingdom and wife Ruma and expelled him
 dar ke kaaran sugriv ne rishyamook parvat main sharan lee jahaan shaap ke kaaran wali nahin ja saktaa tha
 This is where Sugriva met Rama due to Hanuman
 ram ke yah aashwaasan dene par ki ram swayan wali kaa vadh karenge, sugriv ne wali ko lalakaara
 Vali came out hearing the challenge
 donon main ghamaasan yuddh hua, parantu kyonki dono bhaaiyon kii mukh tathaa deh rachana samaan thi, isliye ram ne asamanjas ke kaaran apana baan nahin chalaaya
 Eventually Vali defeated Sugriva and drove him away
 sugriv niraash hokar phir ram ke paas aa gaya
 Rama this time asked Lakshmana to put a garland around Sugriva's neck so that he would not make any mistake in recognizing Sugriva during the duel and asked Sugriva to challenge Vali again
 hataash sugriv phir se kiskindha ke dwaar kii ore wali ko lalkaarane ke liye chal padaa
 When Vali again heard Sugriva's shout, he could not bear the brunt of his anger
 tara ko shaayad is baat kaa bodh ho gaya tha ki sugriv ko ram kaa sangrakshan hasil he kyonki akele to sugriv wali ko dobaaraa lalkaarane kii himmat kadaapi nahin karata
 So Tara tried to warn the Vali due to fear of something untoward
 usne yahan tak kaha ki sugriv ko kiskindha kaa yuvaraj ghoshit kar wali uske saath sandhi kar le
 But Vali reprimanded her with the suspicion that Tara was taking an unfair side of Sugriva
 kintu usne tara ko yah aashwaasan diya ki vah sugriv kaa vadh nahin karegaa or sirf use acha sabak sikhaayegaa
 The duel started again between the two brothers, but this time Rama did not make any mistake in recognizing the two brothers and he fired an arrow with a tree
 baan ne wali ke hriday ko bedh daalaa or vah dharashaayi hokar zamin par gir gaya
 The mortal who fell on earth posed many questions to Rama, whose essence is as follows: - ramayana main valmiki ne in prashnon ke jawaab dene kii yathasambhav cheshtaa kii he, parantu koi thos jawaab ke abhaav main ramayana par tippanee karne waalon ne apane-apane andaaz main is prakaran ko uchit sabit karne kii koshish kii he
 According to Kritivasi Ramayana, the Bengali version of the Ramayana, Tara curses Rama that in the next life he will be killed in the same way at the hands of Rama Vali, because perhaps the author of this Ramayana found the whole episode to be irrational and thus resolved the episode

 thomas elva edison mahaan amareeki avishkaarak evam vyavsaayee the
 Edison developed a number of devices including phonographs and electric bulbs that have drastically changed people's lives around the world
 "menlo park ke jaadugar" ke naam se prakhyat, baari maatra main utpaadan ke siddhanth evam vishaal team ko lagaakar anveshan-kaary ko aajamaane vaale ve pehle anusandhankarta the
 That's why Edison is credited with establishing the first industrial laboratory
 america main akele 1093 patent karaane vaale edison vishwa ke sabase mahaan avishkaarakon main gine jate hai
 The great inventor Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, Ohio
 bachapan se hi edison ne kushaagratha, jigyaasu vritti or adhyavsaay kaa parichay diya
 Mother taught at home for six years, her education in public school was only three months
 to bhi edison ne hum, siar, bartan, tathaa giban ke mahaan granthon evam dictionari ov sciensez kaa adhyayan 10wein janmdin tak purna kar liya tha
 At the age of 12, Edison started selling the fruits and newspapers, helping the family with one dollar a day
 ve rail main patr chhapate or vaigyanik prayog karte
 By the age of 20, mastering telegraphy, Edison worked as a wire worker
 jivicoparjan se bache samay ko edison prayog or pareekshan main lagaate the
 In 1869 AD, Edison patented his first invention, the "electoral Voter"
 naukari chhodkar prayogshaala main avishkaar karne kaa nishchay kar nirdhan edison ne adamya aatmavishvaas kaa parichay diya
 Between 1870–76 AD, Edison made several inventions
 ek hi taar par chaar, chah, sandesh alag alag bhejne kii vidhi khoji, stock exange ke liye taar chhapane kii swachaalit mashin ko sudhara, tathaa bel telephone yantra kaa vikaas kiya
 He published an exploratory article on the "ethereal force" in "scientific American" in 1875 AD; Patented the phonograph machine in 1878 AD, which got its present form after several improvements in 2010 AD

 agle das varsho main edison ne prakaash, ushma or shakti ke liye vidyut ke utpaadan or tritari vitaran pranali ke sadhano or vidhiyon par prayog kiye; bhoomi ke neeche kebul ke liye vidyut ke taar ko rabad or kapade main lapetane kii paddati dhundhi; dianemo or motor main sudhaar kiye; yatriyon or maal dhone ke liye vidyut railgadee tathaa chalate jahaaj se sandesh bhejne or praapt karne kii vidhi kaa avishkaar kiya
 Edison also designed an alkali accumulator battery; Used to deepen iron ore by magnetic method, patented the movie camera in 1891 AD and invented the Kinatoscope to display these images
 pratham vishwayuddh main edison ne jalsena salaahkaar board kaa adhyaksh banakar 40 yudhopayogi avishkaar kiye
 The Panama Pacific Exhibition honored Edison Day on October 21, 1915, the highest of inventions for world welfare
 1927 i

 In numerical analysis, the Newton method is an iterative method of deriving the root of a function with a real value, by which it is progressively derived from the approximate value of the original to obtain a more accurate root
 isko 'newton-repson vidhi' bhi kehete hai
 The description of this method for functions with a variable is as follows: mana vaastavik x ke liye falan ƒ or iskaa avkalaj ƒ ', diya hua he
 This method starts by taking the first approximation of the origin x0 to find the origin of the function f
 ab nimnlikhit sutara se mul kaa adhik yatharth maan x1 nikaala jaataa he: This process is repeated again and again until sufficiently accurate values of the original are attained
 is vidhi ko jyamitiya rup se nimnlikhit chalit-chitra dwaara samajha ja saktaa he: Newton's method is a very powerful technique
 isaki abhisarita dwighati hoti he
 But there are some problems of this method also
 is vidhi kii karypranali samajhane ke liye is udhaaharan kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 Let be a positive root of the equation cos ⁡ = x 3 { \ displaystyle \ cos = x ^ {3}}
 ab is sameekaran kaa rup is prakaar badalte hai: Since cos ⁡ ⩽ 1 { \ displaystyle \ cos \ leqslant 1} for all values of x and x3> 1 for x> 1, the origin of this equation will be between 0 and 1
 mana mul x 0 = 0, 5 { \ displaystyle x_{0}=0,5} he
 The first 7 digits of this root are equal to the first 7 digits of the original root
 yadi isse adhik yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa nahin he to mul kaa yahi maan lekar gananaa kaary samaapt kar sakate hai

di belapur · khargar · maansarovar · khandeshwar · panvel Dom Vasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer, one of the most successful explorers of the European search era and a commander of ships traveling directly from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope, the southern corner of Africa
 vah jahaaz dwaara teen baar bharat aayaa
 His exact date of birth is unknown but it is said that he was a warrior in Sine, Portugal in the 1490s
 vasco ko bharat kaa anveshak ke alaave arab sagar kaa mahatvapurn nausenanee or isai dharm ke rakshak ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 The sequence of events written during his first and subsequent visits is considered an important document of the life of sixteenth-century Africa and Kerala
 vasco da gamma kaa janm anumaanatah 1460 main yaa 1469 main scince, portugal ke dakshin-pashchimi tat ke nikat hua tha
 His house was located near the church of Nossa Senhora Das Salas
 tatkaaleen scince jo ab alentejo tat ke kuch bandargahon main se ek he, tab kuch safed puti, laal chat vaali machuaaron kii jhonpadiyon kaa samooh bhar tha
 Vasco da Gama's father, Estevao de Gama, was a knight in 1460 of the Duke of Visayu, Dom Fernando
 dom fernando ne scince kaa nagar-rajyapal niyukt kiya hua tha
 They then levied taxes from some soap plants in Sines
 estevaao da gamma kaa vivaah donna isabel sodre se hua tha
 Initial information about Vasco da Gama's family is not known
 portugali itihaaskaar texiera da aragaao bataate hai, ki evora shahar main vasco da gamma kii shiksha hui, jahaan unhone shaayad ganit evam nauvahan kaa gyaan arjeet kiya hoga
 It is also known that Gama also had knowledge of astronomy, which he might have derived from astronomer Abraham Zacuto
 1492 main portugal ke raja jon dwitiya ne gamma ko setubal bandargah, lisbon ke dakshin main bheja
 They were to capture French ships from there
 yah kaary vasco ne kaushal evam tatparta ke saath purna kiya
 In the early fifteenth century, the sons of King John of the western Spanish state of Portugal were growing up and by that time the entire Middle East including Jerusalem was occupied by Muslim rulers
 purv se aane vaale resham, masaalon or aabhushanon par arab or anya muslim vyapaariyon kaa kabja tha - jo manachaahe daamon par ise europe main bechate the
 In the summer of 1412, John's three sons - Edward, Peter, and Henry - thought that they should be entrusted with something more exciting and challenging than the boring work of a prince and a knight
 unhone apane pita se ye kaha
 One of John's servants had just returned from Suuta with money in exchange for Muslim prisoners
 pichley saat sau saalon main islam ke shashan main aane ke baad agar suta ko portugali akraman se parrast kiya jaay to yah nishchit rup se ek chunaiti bharaa kaam hota
 Suuta was not only a busy port market, but Morocco at that time was in chaos for the last 30 years
 kaaphi naa-nukur karne or rani philipa ke aagrah ke baad jon ne akraman kii ek yojana taiyaar kii
 Attacking Suta, putting on masks preparing to attack Holland
 july 1415 main suta ko fatah kar liya gaya
 Henry, Edward and Peter all served as fighters in this war
 lekin aarthik rup se kuch khaas hasil nahin hua - musalamaanon ne suta ke badale tanjyar se vyapaar karnaa chaalu kiya or suta ke pattan khaali rahe
 Many misconceptions were prevalent in Europe at that time
 unamem se ek ye thi ki afriqa main, kahin andar dakshin main, ek sone kii nadi bahati he
 But reaching there means defeating the Muslim Arabs and the barbarians present in the Sahara Desert
 henry ke vichaar main ye karnaa sambhav or jaruri tha - akhirakar saat sau saal pehle uttari africa par isaiyon kaa kabja tha
 He requested his father to plan an attack on Tangier, but John did not find it possible
 tengier dur tha or adhik surakshit
 Henry's brother Edward was crowned in 1433 after Jan's death
 kaaphi anurodh ke baad henry ko tensioyar par akraman kii anumati mil gai
 But despite the naval forces not arriving on time, Henry reached Tangier in 1437 with an army of 7000 remaining
 jaisaa ki pratyaashit tha - use haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 His generals talked of handing over the price of withdrawal to Sutka in Moroccan hands
 henry ko ye manjuur nahin tha - wo apane bhai ferdinand ko bandhak ke rup main rakh aayaa
 Ferdinand died in prison
 isi bich istambul par osmani turkon kaa adhikaar may 1453 main ho gaya
 The Turks were Sunni Muslims and thus the way of Europe's former trade went completely into Muslim hands
 venice or istambul ke bazaaron main chizon ke bhav badhane lage
 After this, the Spanish and Purtagali rulers woke up to the desire of oceanic knowledge of the previous routes
 terahavin sadi main marco polo mongolon ke samrajya hote hue china tak pahunch gaya tha
 After returning, he told his prison partner that Hindustan was in the east
 san 1419 main venice ke nicolo da konti ne arabi or farsi sikhi or apane ko muslim vyapaaree bhesh main chipa kar bharat kii khoj main nikal padaa
 He traveled east for 25 years, reached India and gave many important discoveries - including the unexpected occurrence of large ships from China at India's ports
 san 1471 main antat tengier par portugali adhikaar ho gaya lekin henry san 1474 main mar gaya
 Now King John of Portugal sent Diego Cao to travel on the African shores
 keo ne 1482 main congou kii safal yatra kii or vahaan ek shila sthapit kii
 When he returned in 1484, he was very welcomed and was given the title of Noble
 ek baar punah apane lakshya kii khoj main nikle diego ne san 1486 main diego ne namibia tak kii yatra kii - yah africa ke dakshini bindu se sirf 800 kilometre uttar main tha
 However, on his way back, he goes to find Prester John in the Congo and then he is not found
 europe main prachlit bhrantiyon main se ek ye bhi thi ki purv main kahin ek prester jon naam kaa raja rahata he jo isai he or apaar sapatti kaa maalik he
 The Purtagalis believed that this king is the king of India
 iskaa pataa lagane ke liye portugaliyon ke raja jon ne do guptcharon ko purv kii jamini yatra par bheja
 But after reaching Jerusalem, he came to know that it was not possible to proceed without learning Arabic - he returned
 iske baad may 1487 main pero da kowilha or aphonso da peva ko gupt yatra par bheja
 They reached Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt
 unamem se pero adan, laal sagar hote hue kalikat pahunch gaya
 He inspected the trade and routes and returned to Cairo
 vahaan use do portugali yahudiyon se mulaakaat hui jo raja jon ne bheja tha
 Information was exchanged and Kovilha headed south to Ethiopia
 vahaan se wo lautnaa chahta tha lekin uske vishwa-gyaan ko dekhakar raja sikandar ne apana salaahkaar niyukt kiya or baad main portugal bhejne kaa vaada kiya
 But he died early and his son did not fulfill his wish
 kowilha vahiin par bas gaya
 a Portuguese mission in 1526 later found that Kovilha was healthy, successful, and healthy in Ethiopia - he married there and died at the age of 74
 san 1487 ke agast maheene main hi portugali raja ne bartolomayo dias naam ke navik ko africa kaa chakkar lagane ke liye bheja
 He was the first European sailor to sail across the coast of southern Africa - Uttamasha
 lekin bhayankar samudri tufaan se parrast hokar waapas laut gaya
 But it could prove from its west to east that Africa has a southern corner and the world does not end here
 isi bich raja manuel ne bharat ke liye ek chaar naukaaon vaale dal kaa vichaar rakhaa
 Gama was chosen as the captain of this team
 kai log isse chakit the - kyonki aasapaas kii ladaayeeyon ke alaave gamma ko kisi bade saamudrik chunauti kaa anubhav nahin tha
 But disciplined and trusted by the king, he was appointed
 8 july, 1497 ke din chaar jahaaz lisbon se chal pade or uski pehali bharat yatra aarambh hui
 Other important names in this fleet of about 170 people were Martim Afonso and Fernao Martins
 aphonso congou main rahaa tha or africa boliyon ko jaanata tha jabaki farnaao morocco ke karawas main rahane ke kaaran arabi sajhata tha
 Ten to twelve convicts were also placed in this fleet by the king, who were given the task of carrying out information and investigative work at dangerous sites
 pratyaashit rup se jahaaj par koi mahila savaar nahin thi
 a week after the move, on July 15, they reached the Canaries, and then the ship broke apart due to the haze
 kep varde main unki mulaakaat honi tay thi lekin paolo da gamma ko koi or jahaaj vahaan najar nahin aayaa
 However the berries and storage ships came within a few hours
 gamma kaa jahaaj agle chaar dinon tak nahin mila
 After meeting, he stayed there for a week and then left on 3 August
 abhi tak ke sabhi portugali yatraaon main navikon ke jahaaj africa ke tat ke nikach se gujarey the - bartelomayo dias ke bhi
 But a stormy wind, which flows across the open Atlantic, pushes the sailors rapidly to the periphery - which Vasco da Gama listened to
 uske apane navikon ko purv kii ore mud kar africa ke tire chalane kii bajaay khule samudr main dakshin kii ore chalane ko kaha
 After walking in the open sea for several days and seeing no land or hope, on 1 November he came close to the ground
 ye uttamasha se koi 150 kilometre pehle rahaa hoga
 a wave of happiness rang among the people
 jahaaj kii marammati or apane nakshe dekhne ke baad logon ne vishram kiya
 The accountant on the ship wrote that the skin of the people is brown, they eat the flesh of seals, whales or deer and herbs of the vegetation
 ve chamade ke vastra pahante hai or unke saath kute hameshaa chalate hai
 From there he left on 16 November
 bartelemeo dias ke die nakshe se tat rekha bulkul mail nahin kha rahi thi, lekin be chalate rahe or 22 navambar ko uttamasha antareep pahunche
 He had received news of the skirmishes with the local people by Dias there, but there was a clash with them as well
 jahaajon kaa marammat ke baad 7 disambar ko wo vahaan se chale
 On 16 December he reached the mouth of the river from which the sailors of Bertelomeau Dias forced him to return
 unako vahaan dias dwaara sthapit cross dikhaa
 No one had reached the subsequent routes till date - so the pre-made maps became useless and they had to make new maps
 tat ke sahare ve uttar chale
 As it was around Christmas, The Gamma crew named a beach they passed through, "natal"
 iskaa portugali main arth he "christmas" or us sthaan kaa yah naam aaj tak istemaal main he 
 By January, they had reached present-day Mozambique, a coastal region in East Africa that the Arabs had controlled as part of the Indian Ocean trade network
 unka peechha ek krodhit bheed ne kiya jinhen ye pataa chal gaya kii ve log musalmaan nahin hai or ve vahaan se kenya kii ore chal pade
 He was also opposed in Mombasa, Kenya
 pahunchne ke baad use bataaya gaya ki mombasa shahar main kai isai rahete hai
 After keeping the ship off the coast, some sailors visited the city where they met white Christians
 baad main pataa chalaa ki mozambik se khabar milane ke baad vahaan ke sultan ne unhen fansaane ke liye ek yojana taiyaar kar rakhi thi
 Gama escaped from there - but he needed sailors or directors knowledgeable of directions to reach India
 usne ek choti naav par aa rahe chaar logon ko pakad liya
 An old Muslim businessman told that Indian sailors live on the nearby coast of Malindi
 koi chaara na dekh vasco malindi pahunchaa
 He felt that he was a Christian - he was considering the pronunciation of Krishna as Christ
 malindi main, da gamma ne ek bhartiya maardarshak ko kaam par rakhaa, jisane aage ke maarg par portugaliyon kii aguwai kii or unhen 20 may, 1498 ke din kalikat, kerala le aayaa, jo bharat ke dakshin pashchimi tat par sthit he
 The king there invited him to come to the port of Calicut, but there were so many obstacles in the path of Gama that he thought that these too would be enemies
 lekin wo milane ke liye vali se mila or phir sangeet ke saath kalikat main zamorin ne gamma kaa swaagat kiya
 Before coming to the court there, he found a temple where inside he found a statue of a goddess
 purtagaliyon ko laga ki ye mariyam kii murti he or use bharosa ho gaya ki zamorin ek isai shaasha he
 That idol was probably that of Maryamma Devi, whom he thought was Mary's mother Mary
 vruttkaar jo gamma ke saath us dal main shamul tha jinako jamorin ne swaagat kiya tha, likhaa - "is desh ke log bhure hai, chote kad ke or pehle dekhne se irshyaalu or matlabi lagate hai
 Men do not wear anything above the waist
 kuch bal bade rakhte hai jabaki kai sar mundava lete hai
 Women generally do not look beautiful
 " fernao martins ne zamorin se mulaakaat main gamma kaa arabi anuwaad kiya
 Muslim advisers in the court caused him many hurdles to talk of business
 unhone gamma ke laae uphaar kii khilli udayi or use raja se milaane main deree kii
 Apart from this, he did not even have a proper gift for the king
 aise kaarnon se use zamorin se ladaai ho gai
 Zamorin's Muslim ministers demanded trade taxes from him
 zamorin ne uske dwaara aagrah kiye gaye stambh ko bhi khadaa karwaane se manaa kar diya
 Reconciliation and then the fight continued
 raja ke muslim mantriyon ne uske dal se kai logon ko agava kar liya
 But the customers on board his ship captured Gama
 ant main use jane kii anumati mili or agast ke ant main wo ravaanaa hua - raja ne usko malayalam main likhaa prashasti patr bhi diya jisamen portugal ke raja jon ke naam sandesh tha ki vosco yahan aayaa tha
 But the very next day some 70 Arabic ships were seen coming there for the attack
 iske jawaab main usne goli-baari kii
 Returned to Portugal in September 1498 with some Indian hostages
 janvari main wo swahili tat par dubaara pahunchaa
 Some 500 days had passed on the ship - people were tired and sick
 pashchim africa tat par ghar se koi 2 saptaah kii duuri par rahane ke samay uskaa bhai -or dal ke teen jahaajon main se ek kaa captain, polo da gamma - biimaar pad gaya or maaraa gaya
 He ordered the remaining ships to return to Lisbon and, after burying the brother, returned to Lisbon with his crew
 vahaan uskaa bhayankar swaagat hua
 Gama came back and narrated his account to King Manuel
 apane purvagrahon ke vipareet use bharat ke isai alag lage or ve portugal ko pahchaan na sake - jisase use achraj hua
 The presence of Muslims in India also caused him a dilemma
 africa main har jagah muslim shashan or arab sagar main muslim vyapaariyon kii taadaad ko dekhakar usko apane "isai kartavya" kii yaad ai or usne do saalon ke andar do or mishan bheje
 The time of January 1500 AD was a very mascot, but there was a delay of 2 months in sending the mission
 march 1500 main pedro alvarez kaabral kii aguai main 13 jahaaj lisbon se chale
 His goal was to urge the Zamorin to drive away Muslim traders, besides establishing trade bases in Africa and India
 lekin kai jahaaj uttamasha antareep par pahunchne ke gamma ke bataae dakshin-pashchim or phir purv jane ke choti raste par jane ke kram main kho gaye
 Kabral reached Calicut - The new Jamorin accepted the trade of European ships and assured security
 lekin us saal ke liye arab vyapaaree pattan main pahunch chuke the
 Kebral caught the Arab ship - saying it was a violation of the trade treaty with Jamorin
 iske jawaab main unhone portugali factory ke sabhi 70 logon ko maar diya
 But Kabral's visit was not a complete failure - he approached the kings of Sofala and Kilwa
 wo bharat main kunoor bhi gaya or kuch jahaaj jo 'kho gaye the" - dakshin america pahunch gaye the
 Before the burial could return, Manuel i set out with 4 ships led by Hoao the Nova
 kabral ke chode ek sandesh ko africa ke tat par ek puraane juute main tanga paaya or kalikat pahunchaa
 On reaching there, he attacked many Muslim ships
 kunoor main ek factory lagaar waapas portugal laut gaya
 Thus, the ships of Portugal, for the next 20 years, took hostility from the rulers of Calicut
 san 1502 main vasco ko dubaara bheja gaya
 His next visit was in 1502, when he came to know that the people of Calicut had killed all the Portuguese left behind
 apni yatra ke maarg main padane vaale sabhi bhartiya or arab jahazo ko usne dhwast kar diya or kalikat par niyantran karne ke liye aage bad chalaa or usne bahut si daulat par adhikaar kar liya
 This pleased the king of Portugal very much
 wo cochin, kunnur or goa bhi gaya
 To the south of Cochin he came to know Christians living for centuries
 gamma ne kuch portugaliyon ko vahiin chhod diya or us nagar ke shaasha ne use bhi apana sab kuch vahiin chhod kar chale jane ke liye kaha, par vah vahaan se batch niklaa
 His second visit was very successful for the mission of the Portuguese monarch as he fought fiercely against Arab merchants - forcing the Jamorin into trade and locating Christians living in India
 san 1524 main vah apni antim bharat yatra par niklaa
 At that time, Portugal came to India as the Viceroy of the colony, but he died some time after reaching there
 portugali rajkumaar or anveshak henry ke baad vaasto da gamma sabase mahatvapurn saamudrik khojakartaaon main tha
 Even after crossing the three continents and two oceans, the battle and success of the king shows his determination to fight the Arab merchants and the African kingdoms in the Arabian Sea and then bring the Portuguese message to India and protect it
 vasco ko waapas pahunchne ke baad portugal main ek safal sainik kii tarah nawaja gaya
 His long journey against his contemporary Columbus did not even revolt and remained exhausted even after he was exhausted
 vasco da gamma ke bharat pahunchne par arab or moore vyapaariyon ke masaale ke vyapaar ko bahut dhakka laga
 Vasco da Gama not only took a dangerous and hard-earned journey to grab this trade, but also fought many wars
 apane behatar banduukon kii madad se wo adhikansh ladaayeeyon main safal rahaa
 This caused the eden-hormuz-calicut water-trade route to be broken or weakened
 uski safalataa ko dekhte hue portugal ke raja manuel ne bharat or purv ke kai mishan chalaae
 Albuquerque, sent from Portugal prior to his treasury, destroyed Arab trade and maritime forces and property in the Arabian Sea, and the explorers reached Malaysia and then China
 solahavin sadi ke at tak arabi bhashaa kii jagah tuuti-phooti portugali vyapaar kii bhashaa ban gai
 At this time Portugal became a maritime power
 bharat main jahaan wo ek baar pahunchaa tha uskaa naam uske sammaan main vasco-di-gamma rakhaa gaya he
 a pit of the moon and several roads in Portugal are named after Vasco

 Palauli is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under the state of Uttarakhand in Bhanoli tehsil of India
 ganit main samishra sankhyaayein vaastavik sankhyaon kaa vistaar he
 Adding an imaginary part to a real number makes a complex number
 samishra sankhya ke kaalpanik bhaag ke saath i judaa hota he jo nimnlikhit sambandh ko santusht karti he: Any complex number can be expressed as a + bi, in which both a and b are real numbers
 a + bi main a ko vaastavik bhaag tathaa b ko kaalpanik bhaag kehete hai
 Example: 3 + 4i is a complex number
 samishra sankhya ko a + bi ke rup main darshane ko samishra sankhya kaa kartiya swaroop kehete he
 The complex number z = x + iy can also be represented as polar coordinates
 dhruviya nirdeshaank r = |z| ≥ 0, ko samishra sankhya kaa nirpeksh maan yaa mapank kehete hai
 Similarly, φ = arg is called the angle of z
 konank φ = konank mukhya maan ke bich main chaiye to us rinatmak maan main 2π jodakar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 The following forms are called polar forms: ise cis φ se bhi nirupit karte hai jo cos φ + i sin φ kaa sankshipt rup he
 You can also write it using Euler's formula in the following way: is swaroop ko ixponancial rup' kehete hai
 In electronics, the angular representation of a complex number for a phasor is often used
 jisamen a aayam evam θ kala he
 Keep in mind that j is used instead of i in electronics and electrical engineering because electric current is represented by i
 The absolute value of a complex number z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{i \ phi }} is defined as | z | = r { \ displaystyle |z|=r} 
 Algebraically, if z = x + y i { \ displaystyle z=x+yi}, then | z | = x 2 + y 2 
 { \ displaystyle |z|={ \ sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}
} The absolute value has three important properties: for all complex numbers z and w
 These imply that | 1 | = 1 { \ displaystyle |1|=1} and | z / w | = | z | / | w | { \ displaystyle |z / w|=|z| / |w|} 
 By defining the distance function d = | z − w | { \ displaystyle d=|z-w|}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a metric space and we can therefore talk about limits and continuity
 The complex conjugate of the complex number z = x + yi { \ displaystyle z = x + yi} is defined to be x - yi { \ displaystyle x-yi}, written as z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}} } or z ∗ { \ displaystyle z ^ {*} \ ,}
 As seen in the figure, z ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ bar {z}}} is the "reflection" of z about the real axis, and so both z + z ̄ { \ displaystyle z + { \ bar {z xxrep 4 } and z ⋅ z ̄ { \ displaystyle z \ cdot { \ bar {z}}} are real numbers
 Many identities relate complex numbers and their conjugates: c + d i ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle c+d \ , \ mathrm {i} eq 0} Yoga: ghataana: Multiplication: bhaag: The n { \ displaystyle n} power of z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ { \ mathrm {i} \ varphi}} is derived as yaa kartiya rup z = a + b i { \ displaystyle z=a+b \ mathrm {i} } ke liye The general formula for a complex exponent on a complex basis is: yahan ln ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ ln} samishra gaghuganak kaa mukhya maan liya jaayegaa
 a lot of caution is required here; See - nimnlikhit sutara samishra sankhya z = r e i φ { \ displaystyle z=re^{ \ mathrm {i} \ phi }} kaa n { \ displaystyle n} vaan mul nikaalane ke liye prayukt hota he: Where the value of k { \ displaystyle k} is 0, 1,


, n - 1 { \ displaystyle 0,1, \ ldots, n-1}
 is prakaar kisi sankhya ke n { \ displaystyle n} wein mulon kii kul sankhya n { \ displaystyle n} hoti he
 The prime value of the natural logarithm of the complex number z = rei φ { \ displaystyle z = re ^ {i \ phi}} will be: antim vaala sutara kisi samishra sankhya kaa vyutkram nikaalane ke liye bahut upyogi he, yadi vah sankhya kartiya rup main di gayi he
