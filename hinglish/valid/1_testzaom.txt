 In the 18th century, a very great monk, Shri Gauri Shankar Ji Maharaj, along with his group, did a parikrama of Narmada Mayya
 He was a great devotee of Shiva, he did austerity of Maa Narmada and prayed to him to see Bholenath
 When his 12 difficult revolutions were completed, So Mother Narmada Ji appeared to her in a happy manner and said that Bholenath is present in his group as a youth named Keshav
 Disturbed to see Lord Shiva, when he returned to Gauri Shankar Ji Maharaj, he really saw the appearance of Lord Shiva in that boy
 When he could not believe his eyes, Bholenath told him that if he could not believe his eyes, then try and touch me
 Dadaji Maharaj always kept a stick with him and used to smoke fumigation wherever he was seated
 Thousands of people used to come everyday to see Dadambar Maharaj as Digambar
 Dadaji had a very unique way of doing public welfare, he used to abuse and beat the devotees
 People of all kinds come from the rich to the rich and the poorest of the poor for their blessings
 Grandpa performed many miracles, such as giving children to those who do not have children, Healing the sick and resurrecting the dead
 The Samadhi of these great saints, who is called as Dadaji Dhuni Wale, is in Khandwa, where there is a constant burning of Dhuni, which is called Dhuni Maiya and devotees come from far and wide to take the offerings of Dadaji's mausoleum and Dhuni Maiya

 That vacuum tube is called x ray tube or 'x-ray tube' which produces x ray
 eksre nalikaaon kaa vikaas crooks kii nalika se hua jisase sarvaprathamexre khoja gaya tha
 x rays obtained from these tubes have many uses, such as radiography, CAT scanners, airport baggage scanners, X-ray crystallography etc
 vibhav ke kaaran electron ko urja e×v praapt hoti, jahaan = electron kaa aavesh, tathaa vibhav
 If such total energy is transferred to the molecules of the cube and this energy changes to x-ray, then the frequency of the emitted x-ray will be obtained by the following equation: e × v = plank kaa sthiraank x aavriti 
 
 
 The equation has been proved in many experiments
 plank ke sthiraank kaa maan 6
62×10-27 arg-second he
 For electromagnetic waves, frequency and wavelength have the following relationship: targadairghy × aavriti = vidyuttarang kaa veg = 2
99×108 me
 prati senkad If the voltage is known in volts, the wavelength of the x-ray produced can be easily extracted in Angastrum units by the following equation: tarangadairghy = 12403 / volt 
 
 
 The wavelength of the x-ray obtained according to the equation is based only on the assumption that the entire portion of the energy received by the electron in reaching from the negative to the positive is converted into electromagnetic waves giving the same quantum of radiation according to the equation
 kintu sab electranon ke liye yah thik nahin he
 There is a very high probability of the electron's energy being partially or completely destroyed before electromagnetic radiation is produced
 iske anek kaaran hote hai
 The electrons move within the bottom of that metal when it is first hit by the metal atoms of the metal
 in parmaanuon se electranon kii gati main pratirodh hota he, kyonki ve parmaanu bhi anya electranon se pariveshtit hote hai
 Each metal has metallic electrons due to which the metals are electronegative
 dhanagar main pravesh karte samay runagra se aanevaale electranon tathaa dhanagar ke aantar electranon main anek sanghaat hote hai or prayek sanghaat main bahya electranon kii urja kam hoti jaati he
 Therefore, when the electromagnetic waves are generated from external electrons, the energy of these electrons is not uniform
 vibhavantar se mahatam urja hongi, kintu is mahattam urja ke electron–arthath ve jinase ek bhi sanghaat nahin hua hai atyant alp hote hai; adhiktar electranon kii urja isse kam hoti he
 Therefore, the x-ray produced is not monotonic; We get a different spectrum of X-rays
 shwet prakaash kaa varnakram jis prakaar kaa hota he, usee prakaar kaa avichhinn varnakram eksre kaa bhi hota he; at: eksre ke avichhinn varnakram ko 'shwet vikiran' bhi kehete hai
 The types of devices that Rantzen invented with the help of X-rays were used for some years in the beginning
 inamen thodaa bahut sudhaar hua or shorer, heading, zeegabhra ityadi vaigyanikon ne aisi eksre nalikaaon kii upgna kii, jinke dhanagar saralata se badale ja sakate hai kintu in sab vaayu-visarjan-nalikaaon main ek vishesh dosha yah tha ki inamen vidyuddhara kaa tathaa vibhav kaa swatantraapurvak parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 This defect was removed in Coolidge's X-ray tube
 1913 main kulij ne vibhinn tatwon par electranon kaa utpaadan karke eksre nalika banaayi jo 'kulij nalika' ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Coolidge used thermal ions in exchange for electrification in the air to obtain electrons
 dhaatu ke tantu main vidyut dhara pravaahit karne se tantu garam ho jaataa he or dhara adhik badhaane se usase prakaash kaa utsarjan hone lagata he main hota he)
 Along with the light, electrons also come out of this fiber and if a strip of metal is placed near the heated fiber in a vacuum to give it electrical current, then the current will appear in the photometer
 kintu is reeti se electron praapt karne ke liye ati ucch nirvaat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Coolidge took a huge bulb of glass and placed a piece of high melting point in its center and completely vacuumed the entire bulb by setting up enough circles of tinted fiber to orient it
 yadi tantu ke is sarpil main paryaapt vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaae to tantu tapt ho jaataa he tathaa usase electron praapt hote hai
 Appropriate energy can be given to these electrons by increasing the potential
 atyucch nirvaat hone ke kaaran vaayu ke parmaanuon ke sanghaat nahin hote, at: electron sampurna urja ke saath dhaatu se sanghaat karte hai or eksre kaa utpaadan hota he
 The main feature of Coolidge's x-ray tube is that the intensity and hardness of the x-ray produced can be changed at will
 vibhav ko sthir rakhkar tantu main yadi adhik vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaae to tantu kaa taap badhane ke kaaran richardsan ke sameekaran ke anusaar electranon kii sankhya bhi badhati he, at: sthir rakhkar yadi vibhav badhaayaa jaae, to sameekaran ke anusaar nunatam tarangadairghy kam ho jayega or utpann eksre kii kathorta adhik ho jaaegi
 Based on this Coolidge tube, but many types of X-ray tubes with the necessary transformations carry the required alternating current from a catabolic transformer and the required reversible high potential from a high transformer
 kulij nalika swayan rujukari he
 In the X-ray tube, only less than two percent of the energy contained in the electrons is converted into X-ray and the remaining 98 percent is spent in generating heat
 lakshya kaa, arthath us dhaatu ke tukade kaa jisapar alpavadhi main electranon ke asankhya sanghaat hote hai, taap itnaa adhik ho jaataa he ki uske gal jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 a continuous flow of water is conducted to keep the target cool
 lakshya main utpann hui ushma ko is prakaar baraabar hataate rahane se eksre nalika se adhik samay tak kaary lene main koi kathinaayee nahin hoti
 The study of X-rays was very important from the point of view of physics, but gradually X-rays were used, as mentioned above, in medicine and industry
 in sab kaaryo ke liye adhik teevr tathaa kathor eksre ke utpaadan kii aavashyaktaa badhati gai
 To solve this problem, many scientists working in the field of X-rays have used different types of tubes and devices
 tivrata badhaane ke liye electranon kii sankhya main vruddhi hona aavashyak he
 Increasing the electronegative in the fiber certainly increases the number of electrons, but increasing the temperature of the fiber leads to the evaporation of its metal and it is likely to erode and break down
 saath hi, electranon ke sanghaton se lakshya main jo ushma utpann hoti he vah badhati jaati he, isse lakshya ke galane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Different efforts were made to overcome both these difficulties and some of them were also successful
 oxide villepit tantuon se nimna taap par adhik electron dhara praapt ho sakati he; phir, paryaapt lambaai kaa tantusrpil lekar isht dhara praapt ho sakati he
 X-ray tubes typically use 10 to 150 milliampere electrons; In current times, 1 umpire or more electron current can be easily obtained from proper fibers and accessories
 is teevr electron dhara se lakshya main jo prachand ushma utpann hoti he usko kam karne ke liye philips, general electric, machalet ityadi eksre upkarnon ke nirmaataaon ne sthir lakshya ke sthaan par ghurnan karanevaale mandalak kaa aayojan kiya he
 The electrons are not in the same place due to rotation, and the heat is spent by the radiation before the place where the heat is generated is reintegrated
 ghurnit lakshya kii eksre nalikaaon main se jo eksre praapt hota he uski tivrata sthir lakshya se utpann eksre kii tivrata kii apeksha anek guni adhik hoti he, arthath photo khinchne main prakashdarshan ke samay main bahut bachat hoti he
 There is another way to increase the intensity and hardness of X-ray
 nalika kaa vidyudvibhav badhaane se bhi tivrata tathaa kathorta donon hi badhati he
 According to the equation, increasing the potential decreases the minimum wavelength, and increasing the voltage sufficiently can produce x-rays of gamma rays similar to wavelengths in laboratories
 vibhav badhaane se eksre kii tivrata bhi badhati hai; tivrata vidyuddhibhav ke ghan kii samaanupati hoti he
 Although simple high voltage transformers were available, there were many difficulties in obtaining sufficiently high voltage for x-ray production
 general electric, machalet ityadi nirmaataaon ne anek anusandhanon ke pashchaat ek karod anusandhanon ke pashchaat ek karod volt tak tak ke vibhaag dwaara eksre utpann karanevaale upkarnon kaa nirmaan kiya he
 More progress has been made by Illinois professor Karst using betatrine
 betatron se 40 karod volt tak ke vibhav dwaara eksre kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 These x-rays produced by the volatile potential are extremely fast and penetrating
 atyant tivratavaale eksre utpann karne ke liye anya sadhano kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, jinamein ullol-janitr vishesh ullekhneey he

 BDA kaa vishwaas he ki vishesh hardware tatva kii licencing ke dwaara vah praadhikaar ke bina bade paimaane par BD-ROM kaa utpaadan kiye jane kii sambhaavna ko dur kar sakegi
 The BD-ROM specification defines four profiles of Blu-ray Disc players, including an audio-only player profile that does not require video decoding or BD-J
 The three profiles of video-based players require full implementation of the BD-J, with varying levels of hardware support

 The biggest difference between Bonus View and bd-live is that a Blu-ray Disc player in bd-live requires an Internet connection to access Internet-based content

 Note that some bonus view players may have an Ethernet port, but they are used for firmware updates and not for Internet-based content
 Also, Profile 2

 The non-cooperation movement started by Mahatma Gandhi gave rise to new enthusiasm among many youth and he gave his support to him, but Pullin still kept his ideals and his path

 Mani was the founder of a religion of Iranian origin that established Mani religion
 yah dharm kisi jamaane main madhya asia, iran or anya kshetron main bahut failaa hua tha lekin samay ke saath-saath puri tarah khatm ho gaya
 Mani was born in the Asuristan region under Parthia and died in the city of gund-e-shapoor of the Sasani Empire
 usne syrian bhashaa main chah pramukh dharmik rachanaayen likhi or ek shapurgan naamak kriti iran ke shah, shapur pratham, ko samarpit karte hue madhya farsi main likhi
 At that time, the Sasani Empire was very wide and included many parts of India, Central Asia and Middle East
 is se ek hi samrajya main buddha dharm, parsi dharm or isai dharm ke anuyaayi aa gaye the
 Mani stated that he is a God-sent messiah and included elements of these three religions in his new religion

 But later when Bahram became the first emperor, he was deeply influenced by Kartir, a great guru of Zoroastrianism, and imprisoned Mani in imprisonment, where he died
 lekin maani dharm phir bhi chalata rahaa
 None of his books have survived, but many of his excerpts are still available

 unki gananaa samaajwaad evam sahakaarita aandolan ke sansthaapakon main kii jaati he
 Before saying anything about the father of cooperative Robert Owen, we have to remember that he was not a fundamental thinker of the theory of cooperatives
 usase pehle bhi aarthik sansadhano ke vikendrikaran ke paksh main anek arthshaastri apana paksh rakh chuke the
 Even the word of companionship, synonymous with cooperative, had already emerged
 kintu isse rabart oven kaa yogadan kam nahin ho jaataa
 uski mahatta is baat main he ki usne sahakaar ko vyaavhaarikta ke dharaatal par saakaar karne kii koshish apni puri eemaandaaree or samathrya ke saath kii
 Always worked devotedly for his thoughts
 haalanki use antat asafalataa hi hasil hui; magar tab tak duniya sahakaar ke samathrya se puri tarah parichit ho chuki thi
 Oven was born on 14, May 1771, in Newtown, a simple town in Centralvale
 saat bhai-bahanon main se ek oven ke pita saadhaaran vyapaaree the
 His shop was for the sale of iron tools
 While the mother belonged to a thriving farming family
 oven kaa bachapan ghaney abhaavon ke bich beetaa

 kaam kii talash main vah apane sabase bade bhai wiliam ke saath landan chalaa gaya
 He got his first job as a tailor in Lancashire
 kuch varshon tak oven vahaan par kaam sikhta rahaa
 Owen spent nine years ahead of him working
 Gradually he accumulated some money and some dreams too
 is bich mahattvakankshaayen jo paristhitivash kuch samay ke liye dab gai thim, ve phir se sir uthaane lageen
 The steam engine was invented only a few years before that, because of the steam powered looms revolutionized the textile industry
 isi kaaran manchester ke kapadaa udyog kaa un dinon bada naam tha
 In the last months of 1790, Owen borrowed a hundred pounds from his elder brother William
 apni mahattvakankshaon kaa khubasurat sapana man main sajaae ek din vah manchester pahunch gaya
 With his modest capital, he started a small factory to weave a thread shoe together with Joan
 jone usase pehle maikenic kaa kaam karata tha
 Given the work, the capital of a hundred pounds was very less
 badi companiyon ke saath kathin spardhaa main oven kii mil tik nahin pai
 In the meantime, there were problems with the partnership with Joan
 isliye maatra teen maheene ke antaraal main jone ke saath apane saajhedaari todakar oven ne apane alag kaarkaane kii neenv rakhi
 Owen was struggling to keep him running when he was reported to be vacant as manager in a large factory in Manchester
 usne apni mil kaa laalach chhod diya or us naukari par ja laga
 At that time he was only twenty-one years old
 vah ek prakaar se satat sangharsh evam safalataa kii shuruyaat thi
 He was hardworking and diligent
 chah maheene ke alp samay main hi vah mil maalik ke dilo-dimag par apni kaaryastylee kaa sikaa jamaane main safal ho gaya
 Five hundred laborers worked in that factory at that time
 oven ke liye yah badi uplabdhi thi, kintu uski safaltaaon kaa sahi myne main to yah prarambh hi tha
 Own night-hard work, talent and dedication, Owen brought the factory to Britain's best in just a few years
 oven udhyamshiltaa kaa anumaan maatra ek udhaaharan se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki usne apane kaarkaane ke liye america dwipon se rooyee kaa aayaat kiya
 It was the first cotton import from the southern states
 yahi nahin oven ne rooyee katai ke kaary main bhi ullekhneey dakshata praapt kii
 Undeniably his factory was one of the best spinning factories in the then Britain; Whose success can be attributed to anyone, it was only Owen
 ikis varsh kaa tarun oven 1795 main menchester ke ek ore badi kapadaa mil kalrton twist company kaa prabandhak or hissedaar ban chukaa tha; jisase uskaa naam vahaan ke sarvaadhik safal udhyamiyon main gina jane laga
 At the same time Owen had to move to New Lanark from his factory work, which was a very suitable place for the textile industry due to its geographical location
 tab tak vah ek sudarshan yuvak ban chukaa tha
 In fact, Owen was told that David Dale, a famous New York textile businessman, wanted to deal with his textile mills
 david del kii khyaati doordarshee evam kaamyaab udhyamiyon main hoti thi
 Owen's fame had reached him
 uski bejod pratibha or laganshiltaa se del chamatkrit the
 Upon arriving in New Lenark, there was another pleasant twist in Owen's life
 david del kii ek beti thiμkarolina del
 yuva oven uske pyaar main pad gaya
 Carolina also could not escape her attraction
 david del ne oven ke haathon na keval kapadaa milon ke ek hisse kaa sauda kiya, balki apni kanya kaa vivaah bhi uske saath kar diya
 It was the event of September 1799, which brought Owen to many achievements simultaneously
 vivaah ke pashchaat oven vahiin apana ghar banaakar rahane laga
 The factory in New Lenark was started in 1784 by Dale and Richard Arcaride
 factory us samay new lenark kii sabase badi kapadaa milon main se ek thi; jise chalaane ke liye jal-shakti kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 More than two thousand employees worked in it; Of which about five hundred were children of poor families
 bacchon main bhi adhikansh kii aayu paanch se chah varsh ke bich thi
 The same situation was prevalent in most textile mills in those days
 david del yadhyapi balshramikon kaa puraa dhyaan rakhte the, lekin koi kargar vyavastha na hone ke kaaran mazdooron, visheshkar balshramikon kii dasha shochaneey bani hui thi
 Most of the workers belonged to extremely poor, uneducated families
 ashiksha, kuntha or hataasha ke kaaran chori, jua, sharaab or nashakhori jaisi anek kureetiyaan unke jivan main pravesh kar chuki thim
 In the name of household, they all had a room, small and dirty, in which clean air was impossible
 bacchon kii padhai kii vyavastha to dur bimaaron ke ilaaj ke liye bhi koi intjaam nahin tha
 By that time, Owen had attained great prosperity and prosperity
 vivaah ke pashchaat uske aatmavishvaas main vruddhi bhi khub hui
 But Owen's ambitions were yet to end
 uske bhavishya kii ruparekha isi aatmavishvaas ke aadhaar par tay honi thi, kyonki yah uskaa aatmavishvaas hi tha jisane use kathor faisle lene kii prerana di, jisase vah aaajeevan apane vichaaron evam uddeshyon ke liye sangharshrat rah sakaa
 Owen corrected criticisms of his government and industrialists for his revolutionary decisions
 His partners left him and left
 karodo rupee kii sampatti jo usne kathin parishram se arjeet kii thi, dhire-dhire uski kalyankari yojanaon kii bhant chadh gai
 But it is not new for the great men to walk separately in history, to do new work, to set new standards for the coming generations
 itihaas kaa darbar aisi hi chunautiyon ko paar karne vaale mahapurushon ko sahejane main garvanubhuti karata he
 Owen Cora was not a businessman
 uske paas khubasurat or samvedansheel maanas bhi tha, jo dusron ko ksht main dekhte hi vichlit ho uthta tha
 He himself came from a poor family
 is kaaran garibi kii vivashtaaon or kashton se vah bhalee-bhaanti parichit tha
 In those days, where there was an abundance of big factories in New Lenark, there were also many small settlements of poor laborers around it
 vahaan kaa jivan naarkeey tha
 Owen felt that the expected increase in productivity would not be possible without improving the living and conditions of the artisans and laborers
 isliye usne apane jivan ke agle das varsh mazdooron kii haalat sudhaarney ke naam kar die
 He saved the laborers' settlements
 un bastiyon main swayan ja-jaakar mazdooron kii gandi aadaton ko chhudaane kaa prayaas kiya
 By reducing the working hours of the child laborers, arranged their education and entertainment
 mahila mazdooron ke liye alag vishramghar or prasuti-kendron kii vyavastha kii
 On one hand, the life of the laborers was improved by these efforts, yet the views of those workers who viewed industrialization with suspicion also changed
 nai vyavastha ke prati unka aakrosh kam hone laga
 As a result production increased, Owen also benefited
 dhyatavya he ki oven dwaara apane karmchaariyon ke kalyaan ke liye jitne bhi kadam uthaae gaye unke peeche uski vishuddh vyavsaayik drushti thi
 Like a skilled entrepreneur, he was adept at turning situations in his favor
 karl macrs ke sahyogi or macrsvaadi vichaarak fradrik anglas ne apane charchit lekh—socialism: Utopian and Scientific main spasht rup se ullekh kiya he ki— This is what Owen thought
 tulanaatmak rup main usne apane karmchaariyon ko behatar vaataavaran uplabdh karaane ke prayaas to kiye, magar ve unke vyaktitv evam buddhi ke chahumunkhi vikaas se kaaphi dur the
 They were allowed to use their discretion limited to very few, specific contexts
 oven par sudhaarwadiyon kaa prabhaav padaa tha
 He was an honored member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester
 scottish navajagaran andolan se prabhavit oven kaa maananaa tha ki manushya kaa vyaktitv uske vaataavaran se prabhavit evam vinirmit hota he
 Hence, personality can be refined by improving the environment
 ‘shiksha naitik jagat se sampark karaane vaala ingine he
 He was a supporter of this dictation of a historian, underlining the importance of education
 vyaktitv nirmaan ke liye shiksha kii anivaaryta darshaate hue usne kaha tha ki— In those days most of the factory owners used to pay their laborers on the basis of commodity exchange rather than cash wages
 tadnusaar mazdooron ko token de die jate the; jinaki kaarkaana maalikon ke samooh se baahar koi keemat na thi
 In exchange for those tokens, laborers could buy essential goods from the designated shops
 mazdooron kii vivashtaa kaa laabh uthaane ke liye un dukaanon par bhi unka khulaa shoshan hota tha
 The goods found there were cheap and expensive compared to the market
 us kuriti ke viruddh aawaaj uthne lagi to, british sansad ne gaiyrkanoonee qaraar dete hue usapar roak laga di thi
 Owing to the problem of laborers, Owen started a consumer center where good quality goods could be obtained by paying just above the cost price
 usne mazdooron ke charitrik vikaas ke liye bhi aavashyak kadam uthaae
 Knowing that laborers spend a large part of their earnings on alcohol and other intoxicants, Owen puts their sales under tight control
 yahi nahin oven ne apane kamgaaron ko upabhokta bhandaron se thok kharid ke liye bhi protsaahit kiya; jisase ve adhik bachat kar saken
 bachat par jor dete hue usne mazdooron ko kathin samay ke liye apni aay kaa ek hissaa anivaary rup se bachaane ke liye kaha
 balshramikon ke liye usne behatar paristhitiyon kaa srijan kiya
 Ensured their working hours and opened schools for compulsory education
 Owen's consumer stores had substantial success
 usee ne aage chalakar sahakaari kshetra ke upabhokta andolan ko prerit kiya
 However, cooperative consumer-led consumer centers were successfully launched almost four decades after the Rochelle Pioneers established the first consumer center in the Todlane area of london
 un dinon mil mazdooron ko pratidin kam se kam gyaarah ghante lagaataar kaary karnaa padataa tha
 Owen cut it to an hour per day
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main yah kadam sahaspurn hone ke saath-saath chamatkaarik bhi tha
 His move was strongly opposed by other industrialists
 puunjipatiyon dwaara poshit samachaarpatr-patrikaon main oven ke is kadam kii aalochana karne vaale lekh chaape gaye
 Owen prohibited the work of children younger than ten years in his mill without being afraid of it
 mil-mazdooron ke liye kalyaan suvidhaon kaa vistaar karte hue usne unhen kaarkaane main hi awaas suvidhaayen pradaan kin
 Also established hospitals, restrooms and recreation houses
 un dinon kaam ke dauraan hui galatiyon kaa khamiyaja mazdooron ko hi bhugatna padataa tha, jisase unke vetan kaa bada hissaa nuksaan kii bharpai main hi nikal jaataa tha
 Owen ended the tradition of fines, which were strongly opposed by other industrialists
 magar oven apane nirnay par atal rahaa
 Owen's most important contribution was to manage children's education
 usne shishu paathshaalaon kii sthapana kii or sahakaar kaa janmdata hone ke saath-saath vah shishu shiksha kaarykram kaa prarvattak bana
 He launched a revolution, making education compulsory for five-year-old children
 yah sab oven ne keval apni aantarik prerana ke aadhaar par shuru kiya tha; jiskaa majdoorvarg kii ore joardaar swaagat kiya gaya
 It is worth noting that Owen was spending a lot of money on the construction of housing settlements for the workers, construction of hospitals, restrooms, recreation houses and baby schools
 majdoor kalyaan kaaryakramon par usase pehle itnaa bada nivesh kisi ne nahin kiya tha
 So initially people thought Owen's behavior was madness
 virdohi oven kaa majaak udaate, apane purvaagrah se bhare mastishk main uske ek din diwalia hone ke mansoobey sajaate
 kintu samay ke saath-saath logon ko sab samaj main aane laga
 Despite spending millions of pounds in labor welfare programs, Owen's factories were continuously generating profits, rather their profits were steadily increasing
 saath hi uski lokapriyata or prasiddhi main bhi nirantar ijapha ho rahaa tha
 Some of Owen's plans proved too expensive
 jisase uske hissedaaron ne virodh karnaa prarambh kar diya
 The partners wanted to run the factory in a normal way
 unase tang aakar oven ne ek nai company kii shuruyaat kii, jisamen usne vyavastha kii thi ki munaafe kaa beesvaan hissaa tayshuda lokahitaishi kaaryakramon par kharch kiya jayega
 jeremi bantham, wiliam ellen nai company main oven ke saajhedaar bane
 Owing to such thinkers, Owen's public programs were sure to get public acclaim
 is bich main oven vaicharik rup main bhi paripakv hua tha
 He was already influenced by Bentham's ideas
 apane vichaaron ko abhivyakti dete hue usne ek lanbaa lekh New View of Society, Or, Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character, and the Application of the Principle to Practice likhaa
 Owen's socialist views were very clear in that article written in several installments
 samaajwaad ke prati oven kii aasthaa aage bhi badhati hi gai
 Bentham was a supporter of the free market system
 uskaa maananaa tha ki mazdooron ko yah adhikaar ho ki ve apane liye apane pasandida vyapaaree yaa utpaadak ko chun saken
 usapar kisi pratyaksh athwa paroksh dabaav nahin hona chahie
 By then Owen's fame had grown
 saath main sthaneey prashasan par uskaa prabhaav bhi
 sudhaar kaaryakramon kaa udyogpatiyon kii ore se nirantar hote virodh se bhi vah vichlit nahin hua
 On the contrary, it intensified its efforts to make legal arrangements for the protection of labor rights
 balshramikon ke kaary-ghanton ko ghataane ke liye bhi oven ne bharpoor prayaas kiye
 But the only failures in this work were his hands; Because by then the industrialists and their supporting officials, who were in favor of maintaining the status quo, had become strong opponents of Owen
 tab tak oven kii khyaati britain kii simaaon ko langhakar baahar ja chuki thi
 Countries wishing for labor welfare wanted to implement the public welfare programs of Owen
 rus, halend, prasha ke tatkaaleen shaskaon ne oven ke paraamarsh ke anusaar majdoor sudhaar-kaarykram shuru kar die the
 Owen's reform programs were heavily supported by the working class
 uske kaarkaanon kaa munafa ascharyajanak rup se badha tha
 Another industrialist who was describing Owen's reform programs as his suicidal move, Owen stopped speaking by earning sixty thousand pounds in a single year
 usne dikhaa diya ki dhanarjan ke liye shoshan, beyimaani athwa galakat pratiyogita hi aavashyak nahin he
 If forward-looking work is done, it is possible to achieve the goal of progress through cooperation and mutual sympathy
 oven dharm ke naam par thopi ja rahi jad manyataon se bhi kshubdh tha
 He believed that the excessive interference of religion in life prevents man from making a logical decision that the pathetic condition of the working class is due to the stereotypes which he has brought up in the name of religion
 isliye apane lekhon main usne dharmik manyataon kii jamkar aalochana kii thi
 As a result, infinitely other influential people began to mobilize against the clergy and religion
 apane kalyaan kaaryakramon ke kaaran vah puunjipati varg ko pehle hi naaraaz kar chukaa tha
 So selfish entrepreneurs and religious contractors started a campaign against Owen
 prakarantar main isse oven kii pratishtha ko dhakka laga
 The oven was truly a great dreamer
 ek behatar duniya kaa sapana uski ankhon main sadaiv jhilamilaataa rahata tha
 In the early years of his life, his faith in religion had ended
 uskaa maananaa tha ki swarg jaisi sthitiyaan dharti se pare sambhav hi nahin he
 If big people use a little renunciation and foresight, then this earth can be made like heaven
 uske soch kaa aadhaar yah tha ki manushya apana vyaktitv swayan nahin, apitu swayan ke liye banaata he yani uski uplabdhiyon evam vyaktitv ke nirmaan main kisi na kisi prakaar dusron kaa bhi yogadan hota he
 Therefore, it is the duty of human beings to cooperate fully with the rest of the people so that maximum people can benefit
 swapndrushtaa hone ke saath vah sankalpavaan bhi tha
 He acted on his plans regardless of his criticism
 majdoor kalyaan ke kaaryakramon ke atirikt usne bacchon ke liye shiksha ko anivaary ghoshit kar bal shiksha sansthaanon kaa aadi pravatrthak hone kaa shrey liya
 He did many other experiments for the betterment of society; Which took valuable time as well as capital
 haalanki virodhiyon ke kaaran oven ko yadhyapi apekshit safalataa nahin mil saki, magar asafal rahakar bhi usne un raaston kaa anveshan kiya jis par bhavishya kii anek vikasgaathaayen likhi jaani thiμor aage jinka anusaran puri duniya ko karnaa tha
 The economic depression took place in 1815
 It became difficult for Owen to pursue reform programs
 isliye usko apane kaarykram kuch dinon ke liye sthagit karne pade
 tab tak oven ke vyavastha kii khaamiyon se parichit ho chukaa tha
 He felt that capitalist system and exploitation are two sides of the same coin
 poonjivadi vyavastha ke paravaan chadhane ke liye jaruri he ki samaaj me asantosh or dishaheenata ho
 Hunger, unemployment, poverty and illiteracy that make the common man helpless, help a successful industrialist build a palace of profit
 janata kii agyanta or digabhramata poonjeevaad ke vistaar ke liye utprerak ban jaati hai
 Seeing the socio-economic disparity of his time, he was getting bored and frustrated with the system responsible for him
 use vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki behatar kal ke liye vyavastha main amul parivartan atyaavashyak he
 Because the present system is promoting centralization of capital and exorbitant exploitation
 oven kii manahosthiti usee ke in shabdon se sahaj ujagar ho jaati he- These were the thoughts of a struggling, dreamy, diligent and visionary entrepreneur who had proved his entrepreneurial spirit in India and abroad
 vah bhi apane adwitiya sudhaar-kaaryakramon ke chalate, jisamen usne apane dhan or sansadhano kaa vyay kiya tha
 It is clear that Owen had all the flaws in the capitalist system
 usko vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki jis pragatigami samaaj kaa bimb uski ankhon main he, vah poonjivadi vyavastha ke dwaara athwa uske samarthan se sambhav hi nahin he
 a system that rests on self-exploitation and abnormality cannot be a carrier of socialism based on exploitation-free and equality
 He believed that a human is affected by his environment, so a change in his personality is possible with the change of environment
 haalanki uske vichaaron main kahin-kahin antarvirodh bhi dekhne ko milte hai
 Criticizing capital-driven supremacism, the French scholar Furrier stated that - vyapaarik mandi ke daur se guzarate hue oven dwaara 1816 main kii gai tippanee uski poonjivadi manovriti kaa pratik he
 He said that- ‘hamaara sarvottam graahak yuddh, ab samaapt ho chukaa he
 ' oven ko tatkaaleen factory system se ghrinaa thi
 He believed that this production system gave rise to social irresponsibility, destructive competition and heartless individualism
 uskaa vichaar tha ki saamaajik tanaav kaa ek kaaran maanviya shram or mashiinon kii avaanchit, aniyantrit spardhaa bhi he
 The solution to this is that human beings get organized and take production of machines and do production work
 isliye usne apane shramikon jivan-str main sudhaar laane ke liye kai kadam uthaae
 Not only this, while acknowledging the importance of high quality, he started giving special benefits and incentives to those employees who were skilled in making goods of better quality
 uske kaarkaane main prayek mashin ke baraabar main vibhinn rangon ke ghanaakaar tukade rakh die jate the
 The quality of the material made from the color of the cube was determined
 isse karigar ko apane kaam ke str kaa pataa hota tha
 Incentives were paid on the same basis
 spasht he ki us samay oven ke kaarkaanon main kaary kaa str or uski paristhitiyaan duusare kaarkaanon ke apeksha behatar, lagbhag adarsh avasthaa main thim
 Owen's influence on New Lenore was decreasing
 uske hissedaar bhi chhodkar ja chuke the
 But Owen's faith in morality and symbiosis did not diminish
 uski nigaah ab europe se baahar ke deshon par lagi thi
 Meanwhile, Owen's fame reached America and Owen received an invitation from America to go to New Harmony
 oven ne new lenark chhodane kaa faisla kar liya
 This decision was also due to the indifference of the British to new experiments
 yun to sahjivan par aadhaarit bastiyaan basaane ke liye scotland, ireland aadi praanton se bhi prastaav aae the
 But Owen did not see any difference in the conditions there
 1824 main oven atlantic mahaasaagar paar karke hormani ;tauvadaladdh pahunchaa vahaan uskaa joardaar swaagat kiya gaya
 In 1825 he bought several acres of land at a place called New Harmony, Indiana for thirty thousand pounds to carry on the experiments of New Lanark
 jahaan usne new lenark ke prayogon ko aage badhaane ke dhyey se ek nai basti kii sthapana kii
 Within a few months the fame of New Harmony spread worldwide
 vahaan mili safalataa se utsahit hokar oven ne oribiston ;vtpaipejavadaddh naamak sthaan par waisi hi ek or basti kii aadharshila rakhi
 Encouraged by the initial successes, Owen also settled in some other places
 Their names are Queen Wood; Funmad Lawyer, Rallatine; Tansanjpadam etc
 ve sabhi bastiyaan sahjivan ke siddhant ke aadhaar par basaai gai thim
 Owing to these settlements as before, Owen's dream was to exploit and establish a class-free society
 vah aise samaaj kii kalpana karata tha jahaan sabhi parsparikta par aadhaarit jivan-yaapan karen
 a colony should have 300 to 2000 members, who have arable land ranging from one thousand acres to 1500 acres
 basti ke sadasyon ke awaas ko chhodkar rasoighar, bhojanalay, sabha bhawan, skool, pustkaalay, aataa chakki, kaarkaane aadi samuhik haa or inke liye ek samachatubhuj ke aakaar kii vishaal imaarat ho
 Owen thought that such a system would reduce the value of money in life - which is the main reason for the habit of collection in humans
 san 1825 se 1829 tak oven ke siddhant ke aadhaar par basaai gai kul solah bastiyon main new haaramani sabase pehali or prasiddh thi
 But due to regional conditions problems started running the settlements
 darasal new haaramani jaise chote se praant main ek saath anek virgon ke log rahete the
 They all had different problems
 isliye new haaramani kaa prayog adhik lanbaa na khinch sakaa
 Owen's experiments in the US first met when one of his American partners parted ways with Owen
 ullekhneey he ki in sabhi kaaryon main oven kii dher sari puunji lagi thi; jisase uskaa vyavsaay buree tarah prabhavit hua tha
 Three-fourths of its total capital had already been spent in the settlement of New Harmony
 oven kaa maananaa tha ki sahjivan par aadhaarit vyavastha kii safalataa uske prayasaan kii vyapaktaa main hi sambhav he
 Any person has limitations, so for the success of such efforts, other people of the society also have to come forward
 sarkaar bhi to sabase adhik jimmedaari he hi
 Thinking the same, he also sought help from the government
 maamla sansad-patal par bhi rakhaa gaya
 But the proposal was rejected, considering it impractical
 oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyon kii khaasiyat thi ki vahaan kaa jivan samuhik evam sahyog par aadhaarit tha
 The entire colony was like a large family; Whose members' joys and sorrows were shared
 mahattvakankshaon main barabari thi
 Even collectivism had an influence on their dreams and resolutions
 oven kii spasht dharna thi ki aadarshonmukhi samaaj main saamaajik sambandhon kaa aadhaar laabh ke sthaan par seva hona chahie
 There should be transparency and co-operation in the work business, only then is it possible to get rid of exploitation
 oven un bastiyon ko sahjivan ke adarsh ke rup main sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 Owen's group of pro-socialists can easily see the glimpses of symbiosis in the anthem
 yah geet oven dwaara sthapit bastiyon main bade hi manoyog se gaaya jaataa tha-‘bhaaiyo utho! athulaneey prem se sarabor or paramasatya se abhasith din ke darshan karo
 Look up, humanity is eager to enjoy and bless community life in place of competition
 ab nyaay kii jeet hogi
 The suppression of the powerful will end, the bliss of universal bliss
 ’1 For twenty years he continued to work for the success of the collective life
 magar dhire-dhire asafalataa saaf najar aane lagi, kaaran ki in bastiyon main basane pahunche logon main adhikansh log aise the jinhen oven ke siddhanton main koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 Many criminals were of a mental attitude to him and the search for a safe haven took him to those settlements
 naakaara or kaamchor kism ke logon ko sir chhipaane ke liye oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyaan bahut anukool thim
 The second problem was that of dedicated workers there
 un bastiyon ke kushal sanchaalan ke liye jis prakaar ke swayan sevakon kii aavashyaktaa thi, unka vahaan saraasar abhaav the
 However, some of the people who came to the settlements had arrived there, truly devoted to Owen's ideas
 magar adhikansh keval shaukia, vakt bitaane ke liye vahaan chale aate the
 Some members of the New Harmony came out of the democratic tradition and wanted to open up the system
 unhen oven kaa ekadhikaar sweekaar nahin tha
 It is noteworthy that Owen's position in those settlements was similar to that of the head of the family
 parinaam yah hua ki oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyon main samasyaayein aane lageen
 In the words of John Curl ‘basti kaa gathan uske sadasyon ke utaavlepan ke saath hua tha
 Due to this, he had already announced his downfall
 shaayad unka aapas main milanaa hi durbhagyapurna tha
 In fact, the group formed on the basis of cooperatives was far from its spirit
 nau sau se adhik logon ke us samooh kaa sabase bada durbhaagya to yahi tha ki sahjivan kii shuruyaat karne se ve ek-duusare ko jaanate tak nahin the
 They included a wide variety of people from different places, different professions, surroundings, including working families, middle class intellectuals, and nomadic intellectuals who call themselves progressive
 samuhik bastiyon kaa gathan baari anubhavheenata kaa shikaar tha
 The result of which was seen in the form of fighting and quarreling
 People belonging to different backgrounds, castes had fought amongst themselves and fueled a feeling of disharmony in others, which was impossible to diagnose
 unke aapasi manmutav itane bad chuke the ki ant main jab samuhik bastiyon kaa prayog asafal hone kii ghoshnaa hui or log waapas lautne lage, to bhi unke parsparik jhagade lambey samay tak chalate rahe
 antat jameen kaa bantwaaraa kar, new haaramani ke nivasee anek sahakaar bastiyon, pariwaron main bant gaye
 ' new haaramani kaa prayog asafal hone ke pashchaat oven ne mexico main nae sire se phir koshish kii
 Due to the high poverty ratio there, he had high chances of success
 lekin aashaa ke vipareet mexico main uskaa saamana paramparawaadi carch se hua, jiskaa vahaan kii garib janata par atyadhik prabhaav tha
 The result was that Owen was boiling from America
 san 1828 main vah waapas england ke liye ravaanaa ho gaya
 But by then the circumstances of England had also changed
 samaajawaadee vichaardhaara teji se apni pakad bana rahi thi
 Intellectuals such as William Thomson were inventing new interpretations of democratic socialism
 sahakaarita par nae prayogon kaa silsilaa prarambh ho chukaa tha
 Workers' organizations were being formed
 samaajawaadee vichaadhara ko aadhaar maanakar nae-nae ubhare chartist andolankaaree sangharsh ke raste satta kii seedhiyaan chadhane kaa man bana chuke the
 He made three big strikes one after the other and made the government difficult
 jisase unhen lag rahaa tha ki ve sheeghra hi satta par savaar hokar bahut aasaani se badlaav ke lakshya ko praapt kar sakenge
 The settlements settled by Owen continued to expire
 dhyatavya he ki oven dwaara aadarshonmukhi samaaj kii yah sankalpana nai yaa anokhi nahin thi
 Nor was he the only intellectual-thinker who dreamed like that
 balki is tarah kii aadarshonmukhi samaaj kii sankalpana usase kareeb saadhe baaise sau varsh pehle plato bhi kar chukaa tha
 John Calvin, Thomas Moore, Rousseau, etc
 also made some similar sage concepts regarding ideal society
 oven yadi apane purvavarti vichaarkon se hatakar or badhkar tha to is kaaran ki vah kora siddhantkaar nahin tha, balki vichaaron ko moort rup dene vaala sachcha evam sankalpadharmee insaan tha
 In this way he was also fundamental in some cases
 usne na keval vargaheen or samanta par aadhaarit samaaj kaa sapana dekha, saath hi apane lakshya kii prapti ke liye usne anek safal prayog bhi kiye the
 It is a different thing that the success he got in the reform programs started decreasing later
 kyonki jis samaaj kaa sapana oven kii ankhon main bastaa tha, tatkaaleen paristhitiyaan uske vipareet thim
 Despite this, it is difficult to ignore Owen's successes
 oven poonjivadi arthvyavastha kaa virdohi tha
 Owen's experiment was ridiculed
 use ardhvikshipt or sanakee kahkar uphaas kaa paatr banaaya gaya
 Owen, however, is considered a supporter of socialism
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki samaajawaadee ;vabapansapereddh shabd kaa pehla prayog usee ne kiya tha
 But Marxist thinkers view Owen's campaign with suspicion
 swayan fradrik anglas ne oven kii niyat par andeh karte hue use ek tarah se chhadam samaajawaadee sweekaar kiya he
 According to the Angles- pramaan ke liye anglas ne ek oven kii ek ukti kaa ullekh apane lekh main kiya he, jisase oven kaa dambh jhalkata he
 Owen wisely, it was said that he had given some facilities to the laborers, while introducing professional skills
 use badale main jo prapti hui, vah kiye gaye kharch se kai guna thi
 Taking this example from Owen's literature, Fredrik Angles explains that- rangay apparau pet main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he
