 Chanderi Fort is located Ashok Nagar district near Guna in Madhya Pradesh
 aaj chanderi yahan kii kasheedakaari ke kaam va saadiyon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 The tomb of famous musician Baiju Bawra, Kata Pahar and collective self-immolation performed by Rajput women are the main attractions here
 babar ke dwaara kiye gaye akraman se yah kila lagbhag tabah ho gaya tha
 It is said that this fort was of great importance to Babur, so he asked this fort from the then Rajput king of Chanderi
 In return, he also offered to give the king any of the many forts he had won
 But the king did not agree to give the fort of Chanderi
 tab babar ne kila yuddh se jeetne kii chetavanee di
 chanderi kaa kila aasapaas kii pahadiyon se ghira hua tha isliye raja aashwast v nishcint tha
 The army of the baber had elephant cannons and heavy weapons which it was difficult to take them across the hills and after coming down from the hills, the king of Chanderi would face the army
 It is said that Babur was determined and he did the unbelievable task of cutting the hill with his army in one night
 His army cut a hill from top to bottom in a single night and made a rift through which his entire army and equipment reached right in front of the fort
 subah raja apane kile ke saamne puri sena ko dekh bhuchakka rah gaya
 But the Rajput king decided to face the huge army of baber with his few hundred soldiers without any fear and after leaving his Rajputs for the last time, he went on a suicide battle
 yuddh main swaabhaavik taur pe samast rajput sena kaa khaatmaa ho gaya
 Then the secure Rajputs in the fort decided to kill themselves instead of being insulted by the invading army, built a huge pyre and all the women put on the decoration of the honeycomb and surrendered themselves to that pyre
 When the baber reached his army inside the fort, nothing came to his hand
 rajputon kaa shaury or rajputniyon ke johar ke is avishwasaneey krity vah itnaa bokhalayaa kii usne khud ke liye itane mahatvapurn kile kaa sampurna vidhwans karvaa diya tathaa kabhi us kaa upyog nahin kiya
 Even today, this path is visible from the bastions of the broken fort which Gauri had built in one night by cutting the hill and it is known as "kata Pahar" or "kati Ghati"
 baad ke ek raja ne us jagah par ek pathar kaa darwaja lagavaaya
 daravaaje ke upar aaj bhi babar kii sena dwaara chalaayi gai chheniyon ke nishaan dekhe ja sakate hai

 Narsi Mehta was the best of Gujarati devotional literature
 unke krititv or vyaktitv kii mahatta ke anuroop sahitya ke itihasgranthon main "narsingh-mira-yug" naam se ek swatantra kavykaal kaa nirdhaaran kiya gaya he jisaki mukhya visheshta bhavapravan krishnabhakti se anuprerit padon kaa nirmaan he
 Narsi occupies almost the same place as Surdas in Hindi in Gujarati literature as Padpanrata
 vaishnav jan to taine kahie je peed paraai jaane re' pankti se aarambh honevaala suvikhyath pad narsi mehta kaa hi he
 Narsi, by compiling the essence of Vaishnavism in it, has introduced his insight and innate humanism
 narsi kii is udaar vaishnav bhakthi kaa prabhaav gujarat main aaj tak lakshith hota he
 In Pushtimarga, Narsi is considered "brides" but Narsi does not seem to be associated with any sect
 unki bhakthi bhagavatashrith thi
 Krishna's Raslila was a special favorite of Narsi as compared to the other Leelas, and he described himself participating in Raas by becoming "divitio" or Deepwakah in a situation of emotional identification
 ve gujarat ke sarvaadhik lokapri vaishnav kavi hai tathaa lokkalpana main unke jivan se sambhddha kinvadantiyon evam chamatkaarik ghatnaon ke prati sahaj vishwasabhaavna milti he
 Historically, the determination of Narsee Mehta's life has been a problem

 According to him, due to the influence of Chaitanya, the time of Narsi Mehta cannot be considered before 1500-1580 AD

 After his expulsion, since childhood, Narsi had to lead a miserable life
 ek katha ke anusaar ve aath varsh tak gunge rahe or kisi krishnabhakt sadhu kii krupa se unhen vaani kaa vardaan praapt hua
 He had an addiction with a monk
 udhyamaheenata ke kaaran unhen bhabhi kii katuktiyaan sahani padatin or antat: grihatyag bhi karnaa padaa
 After marriage, two children named Kunwar Bai and Shamaldas were born to wife Manikbai
 krishnabhakt hone se purv unke shaiva hone ke pramaan milte hai
 It is said that it was due to the blessings of Mahadev "gopinath" that he saw Krishna Lila who turned his life in a completely new direction
 grihasth jivan main chamatkaarik rup se apane aradhy kii ore se sahaayta praapt hone ke anek varnan unki aatmcharitaparak kai rachanaaon main uplabdh hote hai
 Similarly, God helped Narasila many times
 inamen "hundi", "jhaari", "mameru" or "haar" kaa prasang sarvapramukh he
 The "dheed" episode also holds a significant importance in the biography of Narsi, as a result of which she was socially boycotted
 ve stri or shudra ko bhakthi kaa adhikari samajhate the jiske kaaran samast nagar jati unase kshubdh ho gai thi
 Narsi did not let her intuition get frustrated with external influences
 yah unke vyaktitv kii sabase badi visheshta he
 You did not pay any attention to the housework
 sara samay krishna bhakthi main hi lage rahete
 Your brother gave your marriage to Manekbai so that you could take care of the house, but even with marriage, Narasimha did not care
 narsingh mehta kii bhabhi aap ko bahut bhala bura kahati thi
 One day, fed up with the words of sister-in-law, you went to the forest and worshiped in the temple of Shiva for 7 days without eating
 bhagwaan shiv ek sadhu ke rup main pragat hue
 At the request of Narasimhaji, Lord Shiva took you to show Ras Leela in Vrindavan
 aap raas lila dekhte hue itane kho gaye kii mashaal se apana haath jala bethe
 Lord Krishna raised his hand as before with his touch and blessed Narasimha Ji
 ghar aakar aap ne bhabhi kaa dhanyavad kiya
 Once Narasimha and his brother were passing through a forest while going on pilgrimage
 donon bahut thak chuke the or bhukh bhi bahut lagi thi
 a village appeared at some distance
 us gaanv ke kuch log in donon ke paas aaye or kaha kii agar aap kahen to ham aap ke liye khaanaa le aate hai, par lekin ham shudra jaati ke hai
 Narasimha Ji told them that all are children of God, you are the people of Hari, i have no problem in eating your food
 narsingh ne khushi se bhojan khaaya lekin unke bhai ne bhojan khaane se inkaar car diya
 Before walking, when Narasimha woke up to thank the villagers, he could not see the village anywhere

 Once some sadhus going to Dwarka came to Narasimha ji and gave them five hundred rupees and said that you are very famous person, you should write a bill of five hundred rupees in your name and we will go to Dwarka and take the bill
 pehle to narsingh ji ne manaa karte hue kaha kii main to garib aadmi hoon, mere pahchaan kaa koi seth nahin jo tumhe dwarka main hundi de degaa, par jab sadhu nahin maane to unhon ne kaagaj laa kar paanch sau rupaye kii hundi dwarka main dene ke liye likh di or dene vaale kaa naam saanwal shah likh diya
 On reaching Dwarka city, the saints searched everywhere but Samwal Shah was not found anywhere
 sab kehane lage kii ab yah hundi tum narsila se hi lenaa
 On the other hand, Narasimha ji started bringing in the goods of those five hundred rupees
 jab sara bhandara ho gaaya to ant main ek vruddh sant bhojan ke liye aae
 Narasimha ji's wife made all the utensils which were empty and four loaves of flour which were left and fed them to that old saint
 jaise hi us sant ne roti khai vaise hi udhar dwarka main bhagwaan ne saanwal shah ke rup main pragat ho kar santon ko hundi de di
 Acharya ji also gives evidence of this in the small aarti of Anandev
 jaise Roti Char Bharaja Ghali, Narasila's Hundi Jhali
 saanwal shah ek seth kaa bhesh banaakar santon ke saamne aae
 And in the Bharu Chowk gave sands of money to the saints

 Narasimha was very poor, he said that daughter, i have nothing to give in marriage
 main aa jaaoongaa lekin bhagwaan kaa naam hi loonga
 When Narasimha ji arrived at Dhyoti's wedding, a woman asked him that his daughter's maternal uncle and maternal grandfather had come, what he had given in the wedding
 aage se samadhani ne majaak main kah diya kii do bhaathe diye hai
 Hearing this, Narasimha became ashamed and remembering God and asked him to save his honor
 tabhi bhagwaan bail gadee lad kar saamaan kii laae
 God brought red suit, chunari, all the wedding brocade, jewel, pearl, diamond, horse, palanquin and many other gifts for the girl
 narsingh ji ne khushi khushi bhaat diya
 Then both the brothers broke down in smoke and everyone was surprised to see that both the brothers were full of gold and silver

 All the works of Narsi can be placed mainly in two classes in terms of subject and object
 pratham varg main "samaldasano vivaah" tathaa "haarmala" kii gananaa kii jaaegi
 In these, the poet has described a supernatural event in his life

 The term financial administration is used in a broader sense
 isamen ve sab prakriyaayen sammilit kii jaati hai jo ki nimna kaaryon ko sampann karne main utpann hoti haih Without finance, the government cannot be fully successful in its objective
 prashasan ke liye vitt kii itani adhik mahatta hone ke kaaran vitt ke prashasan kaa adhyayan bhi atyant mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 The government which creates a satisfactory system of financial administration goes a long way in managing its tasks efficiently

 a carpet or rug is a heavy laying on whose upper surface, usually small but very dense fibers of wool stand

 Silk is also used occasionally instead of wool, but such carpets are very expensive and less durable
 kapaas ke soot ke bhi kaaleen banate hai, kintu unka utana aadar nahin hota
 Yarn and jute are used for carpet backs
 oon ke tantu main lachak kaa amuly gun hone se yah tantu kalinon ke mukhaprishth ke liye vishesh upyogi hota he
 As a result, even after wearing a shoe, it remains on the carpet for a long time
 taane ke liye kapaas kii door kaa hi upyog kiya jaataa he, parantu bane ke liye soot athwa patson kaa
 The use of jute makes the carpet heavy and stiff, which is its essential and admirable quality
 achche kalinon main soot kii door ke saath patson kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Wool is dyed before weaving the carpet
 iske liye oon kii lachchhiyon ko baans ke dandon main latakaakar oon ko rang ke garam ghol main daal diya jaataa he or rang chadh jane par unhen nikaal liya jaataa he
 Modern dyeing is done by machine

 The dyeing of wool yarn used in carpet is satisfactory only when the color penetrates an equal amount within each fiber
 iskaa anumaan tantu ke bahari rang se sadaiv nahin ho paata or acchhee rangaai ke liye kuch dhaagon kii gucchhi katkar dekh lee jaati he

 taane ke aadhe taar aage peeche hataae ja sakate hai or unke bich bana daalaa jaataa he
 In this way, the carpet weaving is done on the same principle as that of cloth, but once the weft is inserted, a piece of wool is tied on the strands of the warp
 tukdaa katkar bandhna or lambey dhaage kaa ek sira baandhakar kaatna, donon prathaen prachlit hai
 The tied piece is about two inches long and is stuck in a side by side strand

 There may be a slight change in the method of putting the weft, which causes some change in the properties of the carpet
 aajkal saadhaarant: kaaleen bahut chaude bune jate hai
 Therefore, while weaving them, many artisans sit in front of the stalls and each one sets a wool loop about two feet in width
 karigar apane saamne aalekhan rakhe rahete hai or usee ke anusaar rangon kaa chunaav karte hai
 It is clear from the way of the trap that wool flakes do not rise from the surface of the carpet at right angles, some slopes remain

 Only threads of the same color are made which appear on the surface of the carpet
 in kaarnon se paanch se adhik rangon kaa upyog ek hi kaaleen main kathin ho jaataa he
 Frequent perforated plies are used to pour the same type of balloons, such as when making balloons in a cotton cloth
 oon kaa sira kataa na rahane ke kaaran ye kaaleen bahut achche nahin lagate
 Most of the woolen yarn is buried between the weaves
 is prakaar bhaar badhaane ke atirikt vah kisi kaam nahin aata or kaaleen kaa mulya bekaar bad jaataa he
 The circulation of these carpets has reduced very much now
 wilton kaaleen kii praarambhik bunaavat waisi hi hoti he jaisi brusselles kaaleen kii, parantu bunate samay oon ke fandon ke bich dhaatu kaa taar daal diya jaataa he jiskaa sira chipta or dhardaar hota he
 When this wire is pulled, the snares of wool are cut and the surface becomes as velvety as a hand-woven carpet
 makhmali prishth dekhne main sundar or sparsh karne main bahut komal hota he
 The machine itself keeps on pulling the wire
 wilton kaaleen main oonee makhmali prishth ke guchchhe brusselles kaaleen ke dohare dhaage kii apeksha adhik dridhtaa se bunai main phase rahete hai
 These carpets are often woven thicker than Brussels and do not attempt to lift weights
 komalta or kaarigari ke kaaran mulya adhik hone par bhi ye kaaleen pasand kiye jate hai
 Due to high consumption of cheap carpets, cheap woolen wilts started being made, which used cheap woolen yarn
 ekarange wilton sabase saste padate hai or un logon ko, jo ekaranga kaaleen pasand karte hai, ye kaaleen bahut achche lagate hai
 There is inconvenience in making the wide Wilton carpet
 isliye fande banane or unako kaatane main dhaatu ke taar kii jagah dhaatu ke ankushon kaa upyog hone laga he
 Although these carpets are the latest in machine-made carpets, they are very close to the inland carpets in texture
 samanta is baat main he ki ye oon ke dhaagon ke gucchhon se bane hote hai, yadhyapi guchchhe mashin dwaara daale jate hai or unamem gaanthen nahin padi rahati
 The specialty of Exminster carpet is that the flakes are inserted in vertical rows between the stems
 ye daalane se pehle yaa baad main kaate jate hai or bane se bunaavat main kase rahete hai
 Each bunch appears on the surface of the carpet and is part of the plot
 gucchhon kaa koi bhi bhaag brusselles or wilton kalinon kii tarah chipa nahin rahata or is prakaar vyarth nahin jaataa
 At least part of the loop is suppressed by weft

 The texture of this carpet costs less and the accessories are also less
 bunaavat vishesh saghan sundar jaan padati he or aise kalinon ke banane main asankhya aalekhnon or rangon ke samavesh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Like other carpets, they also have many combinations, but the texture is not distinct

 The texture of Exminster carpets is shown in Figure 8
 alag-alag companiyon ke kalinon main thodaa bahut bhed hote hue bhi saadharantaya dohare linen kaa yaa sooti taana, sooti bharaaoo bana or patson kaa doharaa bana prayukt kiya jaataa he

 iske atirikt kaaleen banane kii mashin, kaaleen kii banaavat or dhaagon ko rangne kii vidhi main dinondin unnati ho rahi he
 This is the goal of preparing more and more goods in the stipulated time and with minimum labor

 Currently, these carpets are sold in large quantities in the US market
 gucchhit kalinon kii mashiinon kii maal taiyaar karne kii kshamta bahut adhik hoti he or mashin lagane kaa praarambhik kharch adhik hote hue bhi saste kaaleen taiyaar hote hai
 The face and back of these carpets are not made together
 mukhaprishth ke fande yaa to silaai dwaara pehle se bani hui peeth par taak die jate hai yaa guchchhe rasinic lep dwaara peeth ke kapade par chipka die jate hai
 In the second method, after some heating process, the adhesive becomes firm and the flakes are firmly attached to the back
 oon ke fandon ke donon ore ek-ek peeth chipkaakar or fandon ko bichobich katkar ek hi samay main do kaaleen bhi taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 There is a lot of progress in tufted carpets in all directions even after the carpet is made, or after the carpet is painted, or the printing is done
 upar kai virgo ke kalinon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 If there is any single word about the carpet of any class, which leads to the knowledge of its entire quality, defect, category and value, then it is the quality of the carpet
 quality pradhanat: kaaleen ke mukhaprishth par oonee gucchhon ke ghaneypan par nirbhar rahati he
 Thus high quality, middle quality, low quality are common terms in the carpet trade
 ghaney bune hue kaaleen ke liye saadharantaya badhiya or lambii oon kaa patala dhaag aavashyak hota he
 a high-grade warp is required with the addition of a large quantity of precious wool
 badhiya patale dhaage ke upyog or gaanthon ke paas-paas hone se kaaleen taiyaar hone main samay adhik lagata he
 Thus, high quality carpet is worth more
 kaaleen kii quality ek varg inch main gaanthon kii sankhya se pradarshit kii jaati he
 However, this practice is not satisfactory until it is also decided whether the knots are inserted with a single thread or by a double or triple thread
 udhaahrant:, tihare dhaage se bana kaaleen dohare dhaage se bane kaaleen kii apeksha, prati varg inch kam gaanthon kaa hone par bhi, ghanaa ho saktaa he

 Bruce Lee's name in Cantonese was Lee Jun Fan
 At birth, the English name "bruce" is estimated to be given by Dr
 Marie Glover, a doctor attending the hospital
 Although Mrs
 Lee did not initially plan an English name for the child, she considered it appropriate and Dr
 Glover agreed to the combination

 Bruce Lee also had three other Chinese names: Li yuan-xin, Li Yuen Kam
 The name Jun Fan is originally written in Chinese as 震 藩, although it is similar to Jun उनके, part of his grandfather's name, which in Chinese tradition was considered similar to the ban
 isliye, bruce lee kaa naam badal kar 震 kar diya gaya, jiskaa 振 ke saath samroop uccharan or vastutah samaan arth tha
 It is also to be noted that Bruce Lee was given a female surname Sai Phung, which, in keeping with a Chinese tradition, was traditionally used throughout his early childhood to hide a child from evil spirits

bruce lee ne wing chun main prashikshan 13 varsh kii umr main 1954 kii garmiyon ke dauraan prasiddh wing chun grandmaster yip maan ke adheen shuru kiya
 After a year of training Wing Chun, some other students of Yip Man refused to take training with Lee, due to his lineage, as the Chinese were privy to the teaching of martial arts techniques, especially to foreigners
 He then began training privately with Yip Mann outside the school, along with his Wing Chun friends William Chyung and Wong Shun Leung

 Lee emphasized what he called "the style of the uncircumcised"
 isamen aupchaarik drushtikon se chhutkaaraa paanaa shaamil tha, jo lee ke daawey ke anusaar paramparaagat style kaa dyotak tha
 Since Lee realized that the system, which he now calls Jun Fan Gung Fu, was too restrictive, it developed into a philosophy and he called martial arts Jeet Kune Do or Way of the Intercepting Fist
 Which he later regrets, as Jeet Kune Do articulates some of the specific criteria that styles suggest, while his martial arts consider the parameters and seams Was living out of s

 Felis caracal The caracal is a fiercely territorial medium-sized cat ranging over Western Asia and Africa
 The word caracal comes from the Turkish word "karakulak", meaning "black ear"
 In North India and Pakistan, the caracal is locally known as syahgosh or shyahgosh, which is a Persian-derived term meaning black ears
 Although it has traditionally had the alternative names Persian Lynx, Egyptian Lynx and African Lynx, it is no longer considered to be an actual lynx
 Instead, it is now believed to be closely related to the African golden cat and the Serval
 The caracal is classified as a small cat, yet is amongst the heaviest of all small cats, as well as the quickest, being nearly as fast as the serval
 The caracal is a slender, yet muscular, cat, with long legs and a short tail
 Males typically weigh 13 to 18 kg, while females weigh about 11 kg
 The caracal resembles a Eurasian Lynx, and for a long time it was considered a close relative of the lynxes
 It has a tail nearly a third of its body length, and both sexes look the same
 The caracal is 65 to 90 cm in length, with a 30 cm tail
 Compared to lynxes, it has longer legs, shorter fur, and a slimmer appearance
 The colour of the fur varies between wine-red, grey, or sand-coloured
 Melanistic caracals also occur
 Young caracals bear reddish spots on the underside; adults do not have markings except for black spots above the eyes and small white patches around the eyes and nose
 Underparts of chin and body are white, and a narrow black line runs from the corner of the eye to the nose
 The pupils of a caracal's eyes contract to form circles rather than the slits found in most small cats
 The most conspicuous feature of the caracal is elongated, tufted black ears, which also explain the origin of its name, karakulak, Turkish for "black ear"
 a juvenile has black on the outside of the ears, which disappears as it becomes an adult
 Its ears, which it uses to locate prey, are controlled by 20 different muscles
 The feet of a caracal have numerous stiff hairs growing between the pads
 These probably help the animal walk on soft sand
 The jaw is short and equipped with powerful teeth
 About 92 percent of caracals lack the second upper premolar teeth
 The caracal is distributed over Africa and the Middle East
 Its chief habitat is dry steppes and semideserts, but it also inhabits woodlands, savannah, and scrub forest
 They generally prefer open country, so long as there is sufficient cover, in the form of bushes and rocks, from which to ambush prey
 Its life expectancy in the wild is 12 years, and 17 years in captivity
 The caracal may survive without drinking for a long period — the water demand is satisfied with the body fluids of its prey
 Since it is also surprisingly easy to tame, it has been used as a hunting cat in Iran and India
 Adult caracals dwell either alone or, less usually, in pairs
 Females inhabit relatively small home ranges, varying from 5 to 57 square kilometers, depending on the local availability of prey
 While the females actively defend their territory against other females, the males roam over much larger areas of 19 to 220 square kilometers with considerable overlap
 Like other cats, caracals scent mark their territory
 They leave their faeces in visible locations, and also mark territory by spraying urine onto bushes or logs, or raking it into the ground with their hind feet
 Caracals hunt by stalking their prey, approaching within about 5 meters before suddenly sprinting and leaping
 They kill smaller prey with a bite to the nape of the neck, and larger animals by biting the throat and then raking with their claws
 Caracals sometimes cover their larger prey if they cannot consume the whole carcass in a single meal, and return to it later
 Some have even been observed to hide carcasses in trees
 It is best known for its spectacular skill at hunting birds, able to snatch a bird in flight, sometimes more than one at a time
 It can jump and climb exceptionally well, which enables it to catch hyraxes better than probably any other carnivore
 If no cover is available in which to conceal itself, a caracal may flatten itself against the ground and remain motionless, allowing its coat colour to act as camouflage
 Caracals produce the usual range of sounds for cats, including growling, hissing, purring, and calling
 Unusually, they also make a barking sound, which is possibly used as a warning
 Mating may occur at any time of year; however, it is more likely to occur when prey is plentiful, which stimulates estrous in females
 The estrous cycle lasts two weeks, and is marked by the female spraying urine containing chemical cues advertising her receptivity to neighbouring males
 The female typically mates with several males over the course of a number of days
 In some areas, males have been observed to fight aggressively for access to females and remain with her for several days to guard against rivals; in others, they appear to be less protective
 Copulation lasts anything from 90 seconds to ten minutes
 Gestation last 68–81 days, and litter size ranges from one to six kittens
 For litters born in their natural environment, the maximum number of kittens is three; however, larger litters are more likely to occur in captivity where nutrition needs are adequately met
 Before birth, the female prepares a den in a cave or other sheltered area, sometimes using the abandoned burrows of other animals
 At birth, the kittens are blind and helpless, weigh 198 se 250 gram, and have yellow to reddish brown fur with black markings
 The eyes open at around ten days, and the deciduous teeth have fully developed by fifty days
 The canines are the first permanent teeth to appear, at around four or five months, with the others following over the next six months
 Kittens are able to leave the birthing den at around one month old, and at about this time the mother will begin regularly moving them to new locations
 Kittens are weaned at about ten weeks, but may stay with their mother for up to one year, when they start to reach sexual maturity
 Life expectancy in the wild is twelve years, and seventeen years in captivity
 Caracals are often viewed as vermin by farmers in Africa as they may prey on domesticated livestock such as poultry and young sheep and goats
 Caracals are rarely seen in the wild despite their relative abundance, as they hide extremely well
 Game drives in countries such as Kenya and Botswana widely encounter other animals, but a sighting of a caracal is extremely rare
 Because it is so easily tamed, the caracal is sometimes kept as a pet and can adapt to living with humans
 The caracal has been hybridized with the domestic cat at the Moscow Zoo
