What are those lies? Let's see !! praveen togadia vishwa hindu parishad ke adhyaksh unki beti kaa vivaah muslim se hua he --- ye ekadam galat or jhooth he
 Togadia has been a Kaiser Specialist

 He has retired without wearing ocher clothes and never goes to his home even in Ahmedabad

 Bal Thackeray's son-in-law is Muslim - Bal Thackeray has no daughter

So be careful! urmila matondkar bhagavat ji kii bhatiji he or muslam se nikaah kii -- jabaki iske pita kaa naam shivendra sih or maa kaa naam ruksana sultan he ab ye kahaan se kis angel se bhatiji ho gai ??

 When she was three months pregnant, she again sat for the diploma examination, but the second time she failed
 She moved to Nov Sed where her daughter was born in January 1902
 The fate of the girl is unknown: either she must have died from a severe starvation or she may have been given for adoption
 sawaal yah he ki anstain ke kaam main meric kaa yogadan tha yaa nahi or vishesh rup se annus mirabilis kagajaat ke liye, kuch bahes kaa vishay rahaa he
 According to a consensus among professional historians of physics, he had no contribution
 Some academics say that she was an assistant fellow in the field of science and she must have helped Aistain in the field of research
 meric kaa anstain ke kaam main yogadan, vishesh rup se 1905 ke kagajaat main yogadan zyaadaatar nimna saboot par aadhaarit he: Anstain's friends and colleagues, who had been engaged in countless discussions of his ideas with him, never mentioned Merrick's involvement in Anstain's work

 In September, Einstein went to Novi Sed to meet Merrick's parents, and on the same day he was leaving for Vienna
 After that, Anstain went to visit his relatives in Germany, while Merrick returned to Zurich
 After Christmas, Fritz Heber, who helped find accommodation for Einstein's imminent move, moved to Berlin in April 1914

 The ancient Mahendranath temple of Lord Shiva, located in the famous Mehendar village of Siswan block, about 35 km from Siwan district of Bihar state, was built in the seventeenth century by Nepal King Mahendravir Vikram Sahadeva and named it Mahendranath
 aisi manyata he ki menhadaar ke shivlinga par jalabhishek karne par ni:santanon ko santan va charm rogiyon ko charm rog rog se nijaat mil jaati he 
 It is believed that all the wishes are fulfilled by doing Jalabhishek at this ancient pagoda at the ancient pagoda of Baba Mahendranath temple, which is of historical and mythological importance
 ni:santanon ko santan tathaa charmarogiyon ko bhi uski beemaari se nijaat mil jaati he 
 It is said that the king of Nepal Mahendraveer Vikram Sahadeva had become leprosy about 500 years ago
 vah apane kushtarog kaa ilaaj karaane varanasi ja rahe the or apni varanasi yatra ke dauraan ghaney jangal main vishram karne hetu ek pipal ke vriksh ke niche ruke
 Hands were looking for water to wash their mouth before resting
 kaaphi talashne ke baad unhen ek chote gadde main pani mila
 The king was forced to wash his hands jaise hi gadde kaa pani kushtarog se grasit haath par padaa, haath kaa ghaav va kushtarog gaayab ho gaya 
 After that the king took a bath with the same water and his leprosy ended
 vishram karte hue raja vahi so gaye or unhen swapn me bhagwaan shiv aaye or vahaan hone ke sanket die
 Then to find the king Shivling, he dug the soil at that place and he found Shivling at that place

 In 1894, Sir William Ramjem proved by examining the gas from a mineral called cleavite that this gas is also found on earth
 cliwite ko tanu salphurik amla ke saath garam karne or peeche queewite ko nirvaat main garam karne se is gas ko praapt kiya tha
 Such gas contained 20 percent nitrogen

 He was the pioneer of economic principles related to village development
 unhone gandhivaad par aadhaarit aarthik siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 JC Kumarappa is considered the first guru of Gandhian economics in India
 apane jeevankaal main kumarappa ne gandhivaadi arthshaastra se jude vishyon par na keval vishad lekhan kiya balki ek purnakalik kaaryakarta ke rup main bharat ke duurastha sthanon main anek aarthik surveykshan karke gramin arthvyavastha ke kayakalp ke liye sarthak kaaryniti kaa pratipaadan bhi kiya
 Kumarappa's economics was based on the principle of giving economic autonomy and opportunities for all-round development to every person of independent India
 bharat kii gramin arthvyavastha or iske prakritik swaroop ko unnat karne ke himachati kumarappa aise birle arthshaastri the jo paryaavaran sangrakshan ko audyogic-vanijyik unnati se kahin adhik laabhprad maanate the
 Even his own colleagues in the Congress Party did not fully agree with Gandhi's economic philosophy
 isiilie swatantra bharat kii aarthik nitiyon or gandhivaadi aarthik nitiyon ke bich koi samanta nahin rahi
 As a result, independent India soon forgot Kumarappa in the race for the sampling of western economy
 kumarappa kaa janm tamilnadu ke thanjavur shahar main 4 janvari 1892 main ek isai parivaar main hua tha
 The childhood name was Joseph Chelladurai Cornelius
 unka unhone madras se apni schuli shiksha puri karne ke baad landan jaakar lekha-vidhi main prashikshan praapt kiya or phir vahiin landan main accountint ke rup main kuch varshon tak kaam bhi kiya

 Was
 is adhyayan ke dauraan hi kumarappa ne paaya ki bharat kii dayaneey aarthik sthiti kaa mukhya kaaran british aupniveshik shashan kii aniatik or shoshak nitiyaan hai
 Meanwhile, he decided to add his original family name Kumarappa with his name
 swatantraaa andolan se jude logon main bhi angrezon dwaara bharat ke aarthik shoshan ko lekar baicheni thi
 At the center of this uneasiness was the public debt that the British Empire inflicted on it, in the name of governing India, and wanted to overthrow the colonial Indians
 congress ke 1922 ke gaya adhiveshan or iske baad 1929 ke lahore adhiveshan main is vishay par charchaa bhi hui thi
 Meanwhile, after returning to India from America in 1929, Kumarappa visited the Sabarmati Ashram to meet Gandhi in the context of publishing his article on Indian economic exploitation
 gandhi ne apane patr yang india main is lekh ko prakashit karne main ruchi bhi dikhaayi or kumarappa se gujarat ke gramin kshetron main aarthik surveykshan karne kaa aagrah kiya
 At Gandhi's behest, Kumarappa went to survey at Matar Taluka in Kheda district of Gujarat
 gujarat kaa yah ilaaka pichley kai saalon se kam varsha ke kaaran bheeshan jal sankat se guzar rahaa tha lekin iske baavjood rajasav vasuuli ke liye sarkari amala behad sakhti dikhaa rahaa tha
 Kumarappa, through an economic survey of the residents of 45 villages of Matar Taluka, demonstrated for the first time the statistical correlation between the rate of revenue collection and the agro-based economy
 isi dauraan yang india main kumarappa ke lekh ‘saarvajanik vitt or hamaari nirdhantaa’ kaa silsilewar prakaashan bhi shuru ho gaya
 Also, the Economic Survey of Matar Taluka was being published
 in prakashnon ke bich gandhi ne namak satyagrah ke liye dandi yatra bhi shuru kar di
 When the British administration arrested Gandhi for participating in the Salt Satyagraha, the responsibility of operating Young India fell on Kumarappa
 is patr main lekhan ke kaaran kumarappa ko bhi giraftaar karke dedh saal ke liye jail bhej diya gaya
 Kumarappa was released after the gandhi-irwin Pact in 1931 and was made the chairman of the committee set up at the Lahore Congress session to properly examine the financial dealings between the British government and India
 is congress adhiveshan ke baad gandhi golmez sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye england chale gayi
 In Gandhi's absence, Kumarappa again took up the responsibility of editing Young India and due to his aggressive writing, the British government arrested him again and sent him to Zell for two and a half years
 1933 main xel se chhootane ke baad kumarappa ne bihar main vinaashkari bhucamp ke raahat-kaary ke paise ke len-dein kaa kaam dekha
 Like a very honest and devoted volunteer, Kumarappa also refused to pay for his arrival and return to Gandhi, who was part of this relief work
 gandhi ne 1934 main wardha ashram main kumarappa ke netritv main akhil bhartiya gram udyog sangh kii sthapana kii jisamen gramin arthvyavastha ke anukool utpaadon ke nirmaan, sangrakshan evam prasar kaa abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 Kumarappa was well aware of the contribution of the rural economic condition to the strengthening of the Indian economy and hence he took full time to make this Village Industry Association effective
 akhil bhartiya gram udyog sangh main apane is anubhav ke aadhaar par san 1936 main kumarappa ne 'gram andolan kyon?' sheershak se ek pustak prakashit kii jo gaanvon kii aarthik unnati par kendrit gandhivaadi arthshaastra ke siddhanton ke ghoshnaa patr ke samaan he
 During 1939-40, Kumarappa conducted comprehensive economic surveys in Madhya Pradesh and North West Frontier Province
 1942 main jab british sarkaar dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa adhiktar karch bharat par daalana chaahati thi to kumarappa ne iske virodh main ek lekh ‘stone for bread’ likhaa or jiske prakaashan ke baad unhen ek baar phir xel bhej diya gaya
 Kumarappa, using his zeal stay well, wrote two books titled 'practice and Percepts of Jesus' and 'economy of Parmanance'

 As the Sun moves due to the annual motion of the Earth, it moves in front of this star, continuous measurement of the intensity of the radio wave coming from the star is made
 yah tivrata kirit kii drishy seemaa tak taare ke pahunchne se pehle hi kam hone lagati he
 It has been observed that in fact, the intensity of radio waves starts attenuating from 20 times the radius of the Sun
 yaheen nahin, kabhi-kabhi kirit padaarth lakhon kilometre dur tak aa jaataa hai or kabhi-kabhi to vah prithvi tak pahunchakar bheeshan chumbakeey vikshobh or deeptiman dhruvaprabha utpann kar detaa he

 This leads to the conclusion that the shape of the Kirit is dependent on the magnetic field of the Sun
 kiriti varncrampatt main satat vikiran ankit hota he, jisamen kuch deeptiman rekhaayen sthit hoti hai
 The reason for these lines could not be known for many years, because their wavelengths did not correspond to the wavelengths of the spectral lines of any known element
 at: jyatishiyon ne yah kalpana kii ki suryakirit main 'coronium' naamak ek naveen tatv upasthit he
 But shani-saini: The spaces of the periodic table of new elements started to be filled and it has been conclusively proven that coronium is not a new element, but only a known element whose physical state of the kirite is presented in the wavelengths of the lines It changes that it is not easy to identify them
 san 1940 main adlen ne is prashn kaa purna rup se samaadhaan kiya
 On the basis of theoretical calculations, he proved that many of the major lines of Kirit's spectrum are produced by extremely ionized atoms of iron, nickel and calcium
 udaahranarth, loh ke udasin parmaanu main 26 electran hote hai or kirit ke varnakram kar harith rekha kaa ve parmaanu vikiran karte hai, jinke 13 electran ynit ho chuke hai

 This observation supports several types of observations, among which the study of the intensity of radio radiation coming from the Sun is prominent
 kirit, saura jwaala or varnmandal kaa prakashmandal kii apeksha adhik taap par hona atyant visham paristhiti upasthit karata hai
 This high temperature cannot be caused by heat convection from the atmosphere, because the heat travels from high temperature to low temperature
 kirit ke is atyadhik taap kaa kaaran abhi tak nishchayatmak rup se gyaat nahin ho sakaa hai
 Many astrologers have expressed many views on this subject from time to time, the main of which are the following
 menzal ne yah kalpana kii ki surya ke antar main kisi kaaran aise bhavar utpann hote hai jinamein surya ke ucch tapawale nimna staron kaa padaarth vistaran karata hua uske prishth tak aa pahunchataa he or prayek kshan vistaran ke kaaran utpann honevaale taap ke hraas ko rokane ke liye bhanvar ke padaarth kaa pun: taapan hota rahata hai
 This substance keeps rising up in the atmosphere and after some time, he mixes his heat in the kirt and gives it a great heat

 Most astrologers agree with the view that this region is the origin of disturbed motion related to snakes and corpuscles
 thomas or houtgast ke matanusaar surya ke andar se ushn gas kii dharaayen dhwani kii gati se bhi adhik veg ke saath kirit main pravesh karti hai or prekshit taap tak usko tapt karti hai
 Schwarschild has also expressed similar views, but he believes that the velocity of these currents of hot gas is less than the speed of sound
 yah asambhav nahin ki is prakaar ke prabhaavon kaa kirit ke lakshanon kaa nirdhaaran karne main atyant mahatvapurn bhaag ho
 Olfwen has proved that electromagnetic waves are produced when electromagnetic material is moving in a magnetic field
 surya ke evam kalankon ke chumbakeey kshetra main vidyaman padaarth kii gati aisi tarangen utpann karne main samarth he
 Olufven and Wallen hold that as these waves move in the kirits their energy decreases and this energy is able to heat the kirits to the desired temperature
 aajkal in vichaaron kaa vistrut pareekshan ho rahaa he or aisa anumaan he ki is prakaar kii prakriya kaa kirit kii tapochchata main haath ho saktaa he
 But it is impossible to say definitively whether fluid-magnetic waves can heat the kirit to the desired temperature

 These rites had a profound effect on the child
 bachapan main hi inhen hanuman kavach kaa paath sikhaaya gaya
 Saint Brajdas Ji of Nimbarka sect initiated the child
 us samay desh gulaami kii zanjeeron main jakadaaa hua tha
 His father was in Calcutta because of his business and in Assam with his grandfather
 kalakatta main ye swatantraaa andolan ke krantikariyon arvind ghosh, deshbandhu chitaranjan das, pan jhabarmal sharma ke sampark main aae or azaadi andolan main kud pade
 After this, when Lokmanya Tilak and Gopalakrishna Gokhale came to Calcutta, Bhai ji came in contact with them, after which he met Gandhiji
 vir savkarkar dwaara likhe gaye '1857 kaa swatantry samar granth' se bhai ji bahut prabhavit hue or 1938 main ve vir saavarkar se milane ke liye mumbai chale aae
 In 1906, he agitated against the use of cow fat in clothes and waged a struggle to boycott foreign goods and foreign clothes
 yuvavastha main hi unhone khaadi or swadeshi vastuon kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar diya
 When Vikram Samvat came to Calcutta in 1971 to collect funds for the establishment of Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya Banaras Hindu University, Bhaiji met many people and donated money for this work
 kalakatta main aazaadee andolan or krantikariyon ke saath kaam karne ke ek maamle main tatkaaleen british sarkaar ne hanuman prasad poddar sahit kai pramukh vyapaariyon ko rajdroh ke aarope main giraftaar kar jail bhej diya
 These people had helped in looting a cache of British government weapons

 He was later placed under house arrest in Alipur Jail
 nazarbandi ke dauraan bhayeeji ne samay kaa bharpoor sadupyog kiya vahaan ve apni dincharya subah teen baje shuru karte the or puraa samay paramatma kaa dhyaan karne main hi bitaate the

 Later he moved to Mumbai under the inspiration of Jamnalal Bajaj
 yahan ve vir saavarkar, netaji subhash chandra bose, mahadev desai or krishnadas jaju jaisi vibhootiyon ke nikat sampark main aae
 In Mumbai, he organized the Agrawal youth and established the Marwari Khadi Prachar Mandal
 iske baad ve prasikad sangitacharya vishnu digambar ke satsang main aae or unke hriday main sangeet kaa jharnaa bah niklaa
 Then he wrote devotional songs which were published under the name of 'patra-pushp'
 mumbai main ve apane mausere bhai jaidayal goyanka ji ke gita paath se bahut prabhavit the
 Seeing his love for the Gita and the curiosity about the Gita of the people, Bhai Ji pledged that he would make Srimad Bhagavadgita available to the people at a minimum price
 phir unhone gita par ek tikaa likhi or use kalakatta ke vanik press main chhapavai
 The first edition sold five thousand copies
 lekin bhayeeji ko is baat kaa du:kha tha ki is pustak main dheron galtiyaan thi
 After this, he removed the revised version but mistakes were also repeated in it
 is baat se bhai ji ke man ko gahari thes lagi or unhone tay kiya ki jab tak apana khud kaa press nahin hoga, yah kaary aage nahin badhegaa
 Only this small resolution became the basis for the establishment of Geeta Press Gorakhpur
 unke bhai goyanka ji vyapaar tab bankuda main tha or ve gita par pravachan ke silsile main praaia: baahar hi rahaa karte the
 The problem then was where to put the press
 unke mitra ghanashyam das jalaan gorakhpur main hi vyapaar karte the
 He assured to press the press in Gorakhpur itself and give full cooperation in this work
 iske baad 29 april 1923 i0 ko gita press kii sthapana hui

 People were very impressed with the views expressed in it
 Seth Ghanshyam Das Birla also came to attend the convention
 unka yadhyapi podaar ji se purna mataiky nahin tha tathaapi vah bhaashan unhen pasand aayaa
 Expressing his reaction the other day, he said to Poddar ji - what are the views of people sent to you, how are we saying that we are not critical of this criticism? But they are being propagated in the society by you people, even people believe it far

 Welfare was discussed during the conversation
 Shri Krishna Das ji said - Bhai ji letter must come out
 Poddar ji also spoke of lack of experience in front of him
 Shri Krishna Das Ji spoke of giving support
 Poddar ji was condescending
 Then Shri Krishnadas Ji said to Poddar Ji - God saved you from earthquake in Assam
 God wants you to do something big
 Poddar ji became silent before this argument
 Now "kalyan" was registered and the material was collected and given to the press

 Special issues were published from time to time to make welfare more interesting and informative

 ve aaajeevan aam aadmi ke liye sochate rahe
 His contribution in the promotion and propagation of Sanatan Dharma and religious literature in this country is remarkable
 gita press gorakhpur se pustakon ke prakaashan se hone vaali aamadani main se unhone ek hissaa bhi nahin liya or is baat kaa likhit dastavej banaaya ki unke parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy isaki aamadani main hissedaar nahin rahegaa
 In view of his religion and literature service and his popularity in Gorakhpur in the British era, the then British Collector Peddle proposed to confer him with the title of 'rai Saheb', but Bhai Ji politely declined the offer
 iske baad angrej kamishnar hobert ne `raay bahadur' kii oopaadhi dene kaa prastaav rakhaa lekin bhai ji ne is prastaav ko bhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 After the independence of the country, in consultation with Dr

 Has been world famous
 Due to the excellent system of Vedic studies, mathematics, science, astronomy, Ayurveda, philosophy, astrology, pulse science, literature, grammar, archery fencing, marksmanship, sports training, oratorical leadership training etc
, people from abroad and abroad used to come here and get education
 Many famous doctors, engineers, professors, directors, speakers, lawyers, judges, ministers, The creator of the ideal personality of the Chief Minister, this Gurukul has been famous for the primary to post-graduate level rites with a state-of-the-art education medical hostel facility
 Freedom Movement and Social reformit has been a well-known center of movement
 In the southern part of this Gurukul, having a wide all-round boundary wall in an area of about four acres, there was hostel building, Yagyashala in the Middle East, Drug making center and kitchen in the Far East, Ayurvedic Hospital located in the Midwest, Administrative and Educational buildings in the Northwest and Playground in the middle
 This Gurukula has been world famous for the high level education system and the entire education system from primary level to postgraduate level
 The subjects of the entire education system at Vedratna Vidyalaya Gurukul were - Theology, Jurisprudence Yogistics, Linguistics Naturalism, Sociology, Mathematics, Military Science, Vocational Education, Leadership Training
 In the year 1926, the Higher Education Department of Vedratna Vidyalaya Gurukul at Mustafapur was shifted to Deoghar, Where it is famous by the name of "gurukul Mahavidyalaya Baidyanathdham, Deoghar", spread over about eighty acres of Bhuklhand
 With the inspiration and active support of Pandit Hari Narayan Sharma, "gurukul Kangri Vishwa Vidyalaya" was established in Haridwar in 1902 AD by his supreme aide Arya Samaji Mitra Swami Shraddhanand and "banaras Hindu Vishwa Vidyalaya" by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya in 1916
 Was established
 In collaboration with Lala Hansraj, Gurudutt Vidyarthi, Lala Lajpat Rai, he actively supported the establishment of the first DAV School and DAV College in Lahore in 1886 AD
 The death of Pandit Harinarayan Sharma, the founder secretary of this Gurukul in 1962 AD, His educationist son Pandit Ved Vrat Sharma's migration with Prithviraj Kapoor to Mumbai and his death in 1966 and working elsewhere of grandson Braj Ballabh Sharma and government neglect caused high level education here
 The college is currently functioning in its southern part
 Grandson of Pandit Harinarayan Sharma, Krishna Ballabh Sharma 'yogiraj', the efforts for the renovation and development of Gurukul are continuing

 Pandit Harinarayan Sharma used to run a branch of Gurukul in Sadakat Ashram Patna and Aryasamaj Temple patna-ranchi for effective personality leadership training course
 Gurukul Kangri University was established in 1902 by his friend Swami Shraddhanand with the active support of Pandit Harinarayan Sharma and his fellow friend Lalalajpat Rai
 Subsequently, the Hindu Mahasabha was established in 1909 AD
 Postgraduate level education was started in 1916 in Vedratna Vidyalaya Gurukul
 It was here that in the year 1916 AD, Pand Harinarayan Sharma started publishing monthly magazines 'divya Rashmi' and 'shakdwantriya Brahmin Bandhu' and the famous newspaper "aryavarta" and started producing Ayurvedic medicine under the name "divya Ayurveda"
 "all India Brahmin Association" was formed for the unity of the entire intellectual class
 In 1916, he built a two-storey paved building in 6000 square feet in front of his ancestral house in Punpun and in Mustafapur, and started the Ayurvedic Hospital and Ayurveda Education Center there
 Banaras Hindu University was established in 1916 by his colleague Pt

 The gene is the fundamental physiological unit of heredity
 yani isi main hamaari anuvaanshik visheshtaon kii jaankaree hoti he jaise hamaare baalo kaa rang kaisaa hoga, ankhon kaa rang kya hoga yaa hamen koun si bimaariyaan ho sakati hai
 And this information, the element present in the center of cells, is called DNA
 jab kisi jin ke diaine main koi sthai parivartan hota he to use utparivartan kaha jaataa he
 It can be caused by a defect at the time of cell division, or due to ultraviolet radiation or even from a chemical element or virus
 prakruti ke parivartan main anvik diene muteshan ho saktaa he yaa nahin kar sakate maapne main parivartan ke parinamswaroop ek jaavak jeev kii upasthiti yaa kaary he
 The unit of life is a cell and a set of cells is called living body or animal
 kalpana kiijie, is sristi main yadi ek hi aakaar ke jeev hote, ek hi ritu hoti or raat athwa din main se koi ek hi rahaa karata to kaisaa lagata
 The same type of food, the same kind of work, dwelling in the same kind of environment produces boredom, that's why we keep making some changes in it
 prakruti bhi ekresata se uubakar parivartan karti rahati he
 If we look at the diversity of animals, we will find that, for example, there is a difference between the animals of the cat species: cats, lions, cheetahs, lions are all animals of this class
 isi prakaar, kutton main deshi, shikari, bulldog, jhabara, aadi kai nasl dikhalaai dete hai
 Not everyone knows the root cause of this diversity and the biggest thing is that out of curiosity nobody wants to know this distinction
 hamen yah vaividhya itnaa sahaj or saamaanya prathit hota he ki hamaara dhyaan is ore kabhi nahin jaataa
 But, if we critique the reason for this diversity, then we will really be surprised
 is vaividhya kaa mul kaaran utparivartan he
 The definition of mutation has been given in many ways, but the conclusion of all is that it is a type of genetic change
 koshikavigyaan ke vidhyaarthee yah jaanate hai ki koshikaon ke cendrak main gunasutra ek niyat yugmasankhya main paae jate hai
 At these distances, jeans are wrapped like pea beans at certain distances and places
 jivaracinic drushti se jeens newcliik amla hote hai
 a notable feature of these is that they self-replicate at the time of cell division
 dioxiribonucleic acid ke watsan-crik madelon kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki jab jab di-en-e-kii duhari kundalini pratilipit hoti he tab tab mul sanrachana kii hoobahoo anukriti taiyaar hoti jaati he
 This process rarely makes any difference
 kintu bhul to sabhi se hoti he--prakruti bhi isse achhuti nahin he
 At the time of replication, sometimes, defects occur in combination with nucleotides
 yah dosha durghatanavash hi hota he; isi ko utparivartan kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 Goldsmith defined the mutation as saying that mutation is the means by which new genetic types are generated
 dojanski or unke sahyogiyon ke matanusaar utparivartan naveen kismon yaa naslon kii utpatti karanevaale pathbhrasht bindu he
 In many evidences of evolution, mutation is also considered a proof
 is sambandh main holland ke vanaspatishastri, hyago devijr kaa naam sanmanpurvak liya jaataa he
 He did a variety of experiments on a plant called Einothera Lamakiana
 is paudhe main prativarsh kai prakaar ke spishiz hote jate the, jinhen unhone paanch samoohon main vargeekrut kiya or apane prayogon ke parinaamon ke aadhaar par nimnlikhit nishkarsh nikaale-- 1
 The origin of new species is instantaneous one by one; 2
 aarambh main ye spishiz apane mata pita kii hi bhanti sthir hote hai
 3
 Normally a number of similar species are produced simultaneously
 4
 utparivartanon kii koi nishchit disha nahin hoti, ve kisi bhi rup main viksit ho sakate hai
 5
 Mutations can occur multiple times in between
 isi prakaar ke prayog bidil evam tatum naamak do american jeev vaigyanikon ne neurospora naamak fafundi par kiye the
 He tested the spore of this disease by producing x or ultraviolet rays and increasing its speed
 unhone paaya ki culture medium main is prakaar ke abhikarmit bijaanu bad nahin paa rahe hai, at: unhone kuch aminoacidon ko mila diya
 As a result, those plants started to regain growth
 at: unka mat tha ki vikiran ke kaaran bijaanuon kii saamaanya utpaadan kshamta par aghat pahunchataa he or yah dosha agali pidiyon main bhi vartmaan rahata he
 Similar accidental genetic mutations are called mutations
 sajiv praaniyon ke sabhi prakaar ke aakaar, akruti, rasinic sanrachana, rog aadi gunon kaa utparivartan ho saktaa he
 On this basis, several categories of mutations have been made, such as gene mutation, chromosomal mutation etc
 utparivartan ko taatkaalik athwa aakasmik anuvanshik parivartan kaha gaya he
 This change must be flawed, it is not necessary
 sabhi utparivartan dooshit yaa hanikaarak nahin hote
 They also benefit from this and this natural defect has also been taken advantage of
 is par ham yathasthaan pun: vichaar karenge
 Incidences of mutation are rare or rare
 drosophila naamak kadli makkhi ke adhyayanon dwaara gyaat hua he ki is prakaar kaa utparivartan kai lakh saamaanya spishiz main se kisi ek main bahut hi naganya rup main parilakshith hota he
 Altenberg has attributed the gradual alleged mutation to the modern high speed of race horses
 yah yaa aisa parivartan sadaa laabhprad hi ho, aisa nahin kah sakate
 In many instances, this mutation can also cause a decrease in the speed of horses
 at: nishkarsh yahi nikalataa he ki utparivartan "manamaana parivartan" hota he
 Here Darwin's "principle of natural selection" or "life of the fittest" applies, according to which organisms that can withstand this sudden change are able to survive, otherwise the dead will die
 mandell ne matar kii faliyon par jo prayog kiye the, unke parinaamon kaa kaaran yahi utparivartan batalaaya jaataa he
 No one can say for sure when the mutation will happen
 koshikavibhaajan ke uparaant vardhan kii kisi bhi avasthaa yaa charan main utparivartan kii ghatana ghat sakati he
 If the mutation occurs in a single spore or gamete, it will be reflected in only one of the progeny
 utparivartit peedi main se aadhi santati main utparivartan ke lakshan vartmaan honge or shesh aadha inase aprabhavit rahegaa
 In future generations of offspring with mutation symptoms, they will continue to show the same symptoms
 kaay koshikaon main utparivartan ho jane par use pahchaan paanaa dushkar kaary hota he
 Many times it happens that it becomes completely invisible and no vision can be reached on it
 kintu janan koshikaon main hue utparivartan janankikeey drushti se mahatvapurn hote hai
 a satisfactory explanation of why mutations occur is not available with biologists
 haan, in logon ne kuch aisi vidhiyaan nikaali hai, jinke dwaara kritrim yaa aropit dhang se utparivartan kiye ja sakate hai
 The alleged mutation can always be caused by external factors, which we can classify in the following categories: - 1
 tapakram-janankoshikaon main sahanbindu tak tapakram main vruddhi kar di jaae to utparivartan kii gati bad jaaegi
 2
 Mutation rate can be increased by using chemical-mustard oil smoke, formaldehyde peroxide, nitrous acid etc
 3
 vikiran-ekskiran, gamma, beta, ultrawilet kirnon aadi ke prayog se bhi utparivartan dar main vruddhi ho jaati he
 The late Professor HJ Muller has done many amazing research on this factor
 4
 vayumandal main asaadhaaran rup se parivartan karke utparivartan dar main vruddhi badhai ja sakati he Some accidents can occur during gene exchange
 in durghatnaon ko ham teen samoohon main vibhajit kar sakate hai:-- Of these, the first two types of changes are thought to be serious, which can lead to cell death
 tisare prakaar kaa parivartan itnaa gambhir nahin hota
 Genetic scientists have given the following differences of mutation: - 1
 jin yaa bindu utparivartan 2
 alleged mutation utparivartan kii paribhaasha karte hue batalaaya gaya he ki utparivartan kisi spishiz ke anuvanshik padaarth main utpann gatisheel rasinic parivartan kaa naam he
 These changes occur in the structure and number of chromosomes
 at: is drushti se kisi jin kii aanvik sanrachana parivartan ko "jin utparivartan" kahenge
 However, when such changes are reflected in a particular or a fragment of a chromosome, they will be called "point mutations"
 vastut: in donon prakaar ke parivartanon main koi vishesh bhed nahin hota, at: in donon padon kaa paryaay, roopon main ullekh kiya gaya he
 Mutations are instantaneous, so they are also called "instantaneous mutations"
 bindu utparitarvan ati sookshm hote hai or unka prabhaav sampurna jeev parivartan par nahin padataa
 Hence the term mutation is generally used for point mutation only
 kisi manushya kii janan koshika main jin utparivartan hone par yah uske yugmanaj main sthanantarit ho jaataa he or is prakaar in cobikaon dwaara utpann nai peedi tak pahunch jaataa he
 As a result of numerous cell-divisions, mutation genes also become effective for a particular trait or trait, producing their own copies
 prabhavi utparitarwanon ko unki vaahak koshikaon main sthit gunasutron yaa jeenon main saraltapurvak dhunda ja saktaa he
 But such mutations are less visible than latent mutations
 parantu jahaan tak manushya main hue utparivartanon kaa prashn he, aise utparivartan adhiktar prabhavi ho batalaaye gaye hai
 Gender-associated mutations are more common in heterozygous males because they contain dominant sex-linked genes
 at: nar janakon ke prasupt utparivartan dwitiya peedi kii nar santanon main hi dikhalaai dete hai
 Most of the sex-linked mutations of humans have been considered latent
 ubhayyalingashrayi padpon main bahudhaa drushtigochar hote hai
 If ineffective mutations occur in the gonads, then future offspring will be heterozygous
 alingsutri aprabhavi utparivartan ek baar jab utpann ho jate hai, to kai pidiyon tak dikhalaai hi nahin dete
 But if these mutations are sex-linked, they become effective in the next generation itself
 pranaghatak utparivartanon ko adhiktar aprabhavi yaa prasupt mana jaataa he
 If the fatal mutations enter the gonads, then the future progeny will be heterozygous
 yadi aise utparivartan anda denevaale jantuon main ho jaaen to vishamyugmaji janakon ke lagbhag 1
 Only 4 eggs will not produce children
 lagbhag itani hi santatiyaan bhrounik parivardhan kii vividh dashaon main, janm ke samay athwa janm lene ke tatkaal baad mar jaayengi
 Malignant mutations are commonly visible in the alingosomes and can occur in any of these chromosomes
 samayugmaji murgi ke bhrun ke gunasutron main yadi ghaatak jin hon to aisi santati kaa kankal kurup yaa tedha medhaa hoga or vah janm ke purv hi mar gai hogi
 But children are born from heterozygous fractions and live, even if their asperities are crooked
 aise bacchon kii kreeper foul kehete hai, kyonki murgi ke in bacchon ke pair or qamar thingne hote hai
 In rare instances, inverted mutations also occur
 kabhi-kabhi utparivartit jin anek pidiyon tak vartmaan rah jaataa or ek hi kul ke sahasron sadasyon main failaa hota he
 However, when a gene in a member's gonad suddenly mutates to a normal ineffective allelic, another mutation occurs in such a situation
 is prakaar ke punarutparivartan ko pratilom utparivartan kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 This leads to the conclusion that the patient condition of the mutation may change back to normal
 bacteria main kuch utparivartit dashaayen aisi bhi hoti hai jinamein ve vitamin banane kii kshamta kho baithte he
 But after some time they start producing vitamins again
 unke saamaanya avasthaa main pun: laut aane ko purvakaari utparivartan kehete hai
 Body mutations are usually only visible in body tissues
 kayik utparivartanon kaa prabhaav dirghakaalik nahin hota
 Rashes occur in the body due to mutations occurring in the primary stages of the debilitated state
 vaigyanikon kaa mat he ki cancer bhi ek prakaar kaa kayik utparivartan hi he
 The eyes of a Drosophila fly are usually red, but white spots or complete whitening may appear in one eye
 aisi mackhiyon ko mojeyk kaha jaataa he
 Several examples of such mutations can be given
 vaigyanikon ne prayogon dwaara pataa lagaaya he ki utparivartanon par parivesh kaa prabhaav teen prakaar se padataa he, tapakram dwaara, katipay rasayanon dwaara or kirann dwaara
 Temperature: The effect of temperature on mutation, most experiments have been done on the fly fly, Drosophila
 ek aise hi prayog main jab lingasahalagn aprabhavi ghaatak jeenon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya to pataa chalaa ki 14 degree sein
grey

087 pratishat, 22 degree sein
grey
 par 0
188 pratishat or 28 degree sein
grey
 par 0
325 pratishat ghaatak jin utpann hue
 One thing is clear from this that if the temperature increases even by 10 degrees, the rate of mutation doubles or triples
 is prasang main ek manoranjak baat yah bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki tapakram main vruddhi dwaara hi nahin, apitu atishay nunata dwaara bhi utparivartan prabhaav pad saktaa he
 Keeping the eggs of the Drosophila millenogaster for three days at -6 degrees heat, it was observed that within 25 to 40 minutes the rate of lethal mutations in their x and II chromosomes tripled
 astu, yah vicitra baat he ki sheet tathaa taap main atishay vruddhi kaa lagbhag ek samaan hi prabhaav padataa he
 There is not much light on why this happens
 utparivartan par rasinic prabhaav ke falon kaa adhyayan anek prakaar se kiya gaya he
 Several methods have been attempted to increase the mutation rate by chemical reagents
 is prasang main overbash or rabasan dwaara abhi haal main hi kiye gaye prayogon dwaara gyaat hua he ki sarson kaa dhuaan atyadhik prabhavakaari utparivartak madhyam he
 On observing the effect of smoke given in appropriate amounts in adult Drosophila, it was found that this increases the mutation rate by more than 10 percent
 sarson ke dhuen ke atirikt anek parakiden, farmelene, parmenganet, urithane, caffeine aadi bhi utparivartan dar main vruddhi karne vaale pramanit hue hai
 Apart from mustard and peroxides, the effects of other chemicals were relatively rare
 duusari kami inamen yah bhi pai gai ki inkaa prabhaav sutrovibhaajan ke vishesh charnon main yaa parivartan kii vishesh dishaao main hi drushtigochar hota he
 Similarly, some chemicals affect only the male and not the female
 iskaa kaaran yah batalaaya gaya he ki jab tak koi rasayan koshika ke cendrak aavaran kii bhedakar bheetar tak nahin pahunch jaataa, tab tak uskaa prabhaav sandigdh hi hoga; duusare, bahari rasayan kii koshikadravya hi yadi nishprabhavit kar degaa, to uskaa prabhaav to hoga hi nahin
 Irradiation or radiation - on the possibility of mutation by H

 Muller did some experiments in 1927
 unhone drosophila par eks-kirnon kaa prakshepan karke anek prakaar ke utparivartan utpann karne main safalataa praapt kii
 Since then till now, CLB method is also known to study the effects of irradiation on maize, barley, cotton, chuhia etc

 Ultraviolet light - Altenvarg has conducted experiments on the mutagenic effects of ultraviolet lightings on Drosophila
 unhone vayask mackhiyon ke sthaan par unke andon par kirann kiya
 These rays can have an impact not only on higher animals and humans but only on very soft animals and reproductive cells

 If there is a single breakdown of chromosomes as a result of ionizing radiation, microscopic study of tissues will be necessary
 kintu, jab doharaa bhang hota he or vah bhi ek hi gunasutra main, jab unase hinata or pratilomon utpann hoga
 If the same double breakdown occurs in the non-homologous chromosomes, then transfer will occur

 There is no systematic explanation of the diversity of fauna, however, a summary of what has been heard so far in this regard is as follows- jeevotpatti kii aadim avasthaaon main prithvi kaa vaataavaran anishchit or bhugolic parivesh aaj jaisaa nahin tha
 Physically and chemically, the erstwhile Earth was passing through a special transition period

 Changes in chromosomes resulted in diversity in species, not only in animals
 yah vividhta aaj tak vartmaan he or ab isamen parivartan kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 The reason is that today's natural environment has become sufficiently corrupted and through various technical and scientific inventions, humans are making nature their cherry
 yahi kaaran he ki ab utparivartan ke liye kritrim sadhano kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
