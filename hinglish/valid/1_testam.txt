in dabaavon ke bich baba ne sarkaar se vaada kiya kiya ki vah shanivaar ko apana andolan samaapt kar degen
 The minister was enraptured, he thought, yes he did
 lekin sarkaar kii khushi kafoor ho gai, jab baba apane vaadon se mukar gaye
 Later the government realized that Baba had made him travel in the winds, but by then it was too late
 ramlila maidan main 50 hajaar ke lagbhag log jamaa ho chuke the, ye sankhya agle din ravivaar ko ikaiththa hone vaale logon se lagbhag aadhi thi
 Then the government gave shape to Plan B
 chidambaram ne suraksha balon ko aadesh de diya
 But on the contrary, like Mahatma Gandhi, Baba Ramdev surrendered, he adopted Shivaji's way to escape
 unke samarthakon ne bhi yahi kiya or 40 log ghayal ho gaye
 This was the second biggest mistake by the government
 baba desh ke hero ban chuke the
 The government should not panic
 civil sosayadi ke sadasyon ne doordarshita dikhaate hue sadhvi ritbhanra ke manch baithe jane ke baad apane aapako baba ramdev ke andolan se thodaa dur rakhaa
 Satyagraha of Ramdev was different from the fast of Anna Hazare
 yah koi swaabhaavik pratikriya ke rup main saamne nahin aayaa tha, balki isaki ruparekha pehle se taiyaar kii ja chuki thi
 There was a 'no end' list of Baba's demands
 
 
 jo gambhir muddon se ittar bhi thi
 Baba's promise to Khilafi and distance from civil society also drove the wind's stance away from Baba
 lekin kai ghotaalon se ghiri sarkaar lagaataar khatarnaak munhane par baithi najar aati he or vah tabhi karrwai karti he jab uski jaan par ban aae
 Baba's attempt to escape from there was also indecent
 in sirdard kaamon ke kaaran sarkaar kaa sir bahut lambey samay tak dukhata rahegaa
 And because of this, BJP has also got another chance to shine its politics
 2ji or rashtramandal khel ghotaalon ke baad se hi sarkaar puri tarah sarkaar chalaane main naakaam dikhti najar aa rahi he
 After the failure of the Baba case, the government is losing control of itself
 in sab ke bich congress party khud sarkaar se gambhir sawaal puch rahi he
 The figures are still with the UPA government and there does not appear to be any threat to it
 lekin badalte ghatnakramon ke kaaran manmohan singh apane pradhanmantri pad se thode dur hote dikh rahe hai

 However, the government's stand on voting is still not clear
 somvaar ko epadiai ke mudde par sansad main jari gatirodh samaapt karne ke liye sarvadaleey baithak bulaai gai he
 The main opposition party BJP has said that even after the all-party meeting, there will be no change in its stand and it is adamant on discussing under the provision of voting
 sansadeey kaary mantri kamalnath ne sansad bhawan parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘bahubrands khudara kshetra main epadiai par charchaa karaane par sarkaar kaa ruukh khulaa hua he
 Our main concern is that Parliament should be allowed to function

 privesi ko moulik adhikaar nahin bataane ke baad ab centre ne supreme court main you-turn liya he
 The Center said that some aspects of privacy can be protected under fundamental rights
 atorni general ke ke venugopal ne gopneeyata maamla main centre kii ore se bahes karte hue kaha ki gopneeyata ke kuch pahaluon ko moulik adhikaron ke tahat sangrakshit kiya gaya he jabaki anya keval aam kanoon kaa hissaa hai
 The Center has so far consistently debated the existence of privacy as a fundamental right and stated that on the grounds of violation of 'right to privacy' under Article 21, the validity of 'aadhaar' cannot be challenged
 isse pehle jo karrwai din-bhar chalati rahi usamen privesi ke adhikaar maamle bahes ke dauraan aaj supreme court main atorni general keke venugopal ne kaha he ki privesi ko moulik adhikaar kaa darja praapt nahin he
 On behalf of the Center, Venugopal has said in the court, 'right under life is the privacy which comes under article 21
 lekin privesi ko moulik adhikaar kaa darja praapt nahin he
 In the case of Right to Privacy, senior lawyer Kapil Sibal and Attorney General KK Venugopal have stated their views
 aapako bataa den ki yah bahes aadhaar ke maamle par he
 a petition was filed for this, stating that the scheme to be added from Aadhaar violates the right of privacy
 keke venugopal ne supreme court main kaha ki rhite of life ke kai pahalu hai jinamein khaanaa, rahanaa or rojgaar kaa adhikaar shaamil he, lekin ye sab moulik adhikar ke antargat nahin aate hai
 What the petitioner has to say: Last Wednesday, Gopal Subramaniam told the Supreme Court that independence, which is the basic principle of democracy, cannot run without privacy
 purv solisitor general soli psorabji bhi privesi ke maamle ko saport karte hue supreme main pesh hue
 He said the constitution does not explicitly authorize it, yet it should be understood in the same way as the Freedom of Press is understood
 kapil sibbal:technology rajya ko aakraamak or vyapak hone kii anumati detaa he
 It has the ability to empower and disarm
 1954 or 1962 main supreme court ne 20 veen sadi main uthne vaale mudde par vichaar nahin kiya
 Today there is no need to enter someone's house to know what is happening inside the house
 yah milon dur baithe hi kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In this era of technology, the right to privacy cannot be absolute
 court ko ek santulan bananaa hoga or rajya or vyaktiyon or gaiyr-rajya dalon or vyaktiyon ke bich sanchaar kii raksha karne ke liye ek vidhi hona chahie
 Privacy is related to one's physical existence, thoughts and inter-personal relationships
 jab rajya data acces karata he, to ise kanoon dwaara sweekrut kiya janaa chahie or yah ek vaid uddeshy ke liye hona chahie
 There should be a data protection law in this country
 atorni general ke ke venugopal:jivan ke adhikaar ek purv-maujuuda adhikaar he, jaisaa ki anuchhed 21 - 'jivan yaa nijee swatantraaa se vanchit' ke shabdon se samajha ja saktaa he
 The concept of the lack of right to life through the procedure established by law is framed in Article 21
 hamen yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye 20 saal se adhik samay laga ki anuchhed 21 ke tahat bani prakriya nishpaksh he, wo bhi sanyukt rajya america se mul 'uchit prakriya' avadharana ko aayaat karne ke baad

 Nitish has attacked the Rajasthan government
 unhone kaha- rajasthan sarkaar nahin chaahati he ki vahaan sharaab kii bikri main giravat aae
 This is the reason why the state government has manipulated many places from the list of national highways and state highways
 bataa den ki pichley dinon supreme court ne rashtriya rajmarg or rajya rajmarg ke donon taraf 500 meter kii duuri tak sabhi sharaab kii dukaanon ko band karne kaa nirdesh jari kiya he

 The government excluded many places from the list of National Highways and State Highways
 taaki vahaan aasaani se sharaab kii bikri kii ja sake
 Nitish Kumar expressed displeasure over this decision of the Rajasthan government
 nitish nerajasthan sarkaarake is faisle kii aalochana kii
 He accused the Raje government that the government took this decision due to the decline in liquor sales
 gauratlab he ki nitish kumaar ne bihar main sharabbandi lagu karne ke baad desh ke kai rajyon kaa bhraman karte hue vahaan bhi sharabbandi lagu karne kii muhim chalaai somvaar ko nitish kumaar ne yah bhi elaan kiya ki bihar main ab vah jaldi dahej pratha or bal vivaah ke mudde par vyapak jan jaagran kaarykram kii shuruyaat karenge
 Deeming dowry and child marriage as a curse for society, Nitish said that the way in which women are harassed or killed for dowry in the country is a matter of concern

 Surabhi Gunjan Dave from Jamnagar, Gujarat
 gunjan ek teacher adeucator hai
 When Gunjan Dave's name was nominated for Hot Seat, she became emotional
 sho ke hosbomitabh bachchanane gunjan dave ko chup karaayaa or unhen aansu ponchney ke liye apane haath se tishu paper die
 When Dr
 Gunjan Dave fell silent, Big b gave himself glasses
 big bi ke is andaaj ko logon ne khub pasand kiya or sho main lagaataar taaliyon kii gadgadaahat goonjati rahi
 Dr
 Gunjan Dave has secured 9 degrees
 unhone sho main bataaya ki unhen abhi ek or degree chahie
 Hearing this, Amitabh Bachchan was shocked and said that we have not got a single degree
 amitabh bachchan ke is jawaab ke baad sho main sabhi thahaake markar hansane lage to gunjan dave ne jawaab diya, aapse to log degree lene main zyada gauravanvit mahasoos karte hai
 Amitabh asks why do women wear High Heels? Amitabh Bachchan asks everyone including the contestants of the show, why do women wear High Heels? The list of Amitabh Bachchan's fans is very long
 kai baar darshak bhi amitabh ke sawaalon kaa jawaab aise dete hai ki vah apni hansi nahin roak pate
 The answer to this question was also found to be similar
 amitabh ne jaise hi darshakon se poocha ki mahilaayein High Heels kyon pahenti hai? achaanak kisi ne puch liya, jaya ji nahin pahenti hai? iske baad sho kaa maahaul ekadam halkaa ho gaya or sabhi log thahaake markar hansane lage
 Amitabh also answered the question lightly
 amitabh ne kaha ki vah High Heels nahin seedhi pahenti hai
 Amitabh Bachchan keeps interacting with the audience in the middle of the show
 is dauraan hi unhone darshakon se ye sawaal puche the
 In response, the audience asked the opposite question to Amitabh
 in sawaalon ke badale sawaal poochne par big bi bhi hansane lage or unhone sabake sawaalon se khub chutki bhi lee

 The system is receiving 8,000 phone calls daily

 Munda says, 'I don't mind that so many complaints are coming

 'this system allows people to send their complaints in many ways, including phone calls, faxes, e-mails, and even micro-blogging sites such as Facebook or Twitter

 janata dal you ke modi mantrimandal main shaamil nahin hone kaa asar bihar kii raajnneeti par pad rahaa he
 After breaking away from the Grand Alliance, the way Chief Minister Nitish Kumar wrested power at the hands of the RJD and Congress has given him a chance to celebrate
 nitish kumaar ne jab bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai to mana gaya ki nitish kumaar kaa vahi rutaba abhi kaayam he, jo 4 saal pehle bijepi se alag hone ke samay tha
 However, the expansion of the Ismodi cabinet broke this confusion among his opponents
 janata dal you kaa maananaa he ki iskaa koi asar nahin pad rahaa he or aane vaale dinon main virodhiyon ko phir munh kii khaani pad sakati he
 At the same time, the opposition believes that this will have a profound impact on the politics of Bihar
 iskaa taaja udhaaharan congress he
 Till now, the breakdown in the Congress Legislature Party was believed to be certain
 isi khatre ko dekhte hue congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bihar ke congress ke netaaon ko bulaakar samajhaayaa-bujhaayaa or chetavanee bhi di
 Despite this, it did not show much effect on the Congress mlas
 kyonki unhen janata dal you main apana bhavishya surakshit dikhaai detaa rahaa he, jabaki argedy ke saath khadey hone kaa matlab wo jaanate hai
 The Congress mlas are in tension after the Janata dal-u is not given much priority in this expansion of the Union Cabinet
 jo kadam apane aap aage bad rahe the, wo philhal thithak gaye hai
 According to reports, 14 Congress mlas were to join the Janata dal-u
 do tihaai ke liye 18 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 Congress has a total of 27 mlas
 media kii khabaron ke mutabik janata dal you ke do mantriyon ke kendriya mantrimandal main shaamil hone kii charchaa thi, jabaki is tarah kaa koi prastaav bhi nahin tha
 On the other hand, there was no discussion about the two mps from Bihar, Ashwani Choubey and RK Singh who became ministers
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi apane ghatak dalon ko majboot na karke apane dal ko majboot karne main lagi he
 This is the reason for the concern of Congress mlas

 'anti romeo squad' ji haa yah vah naam tha jiske aage-peeche 2017 vidhansabha chunaav ke taane-bane bune gaye 
 After the huge victory in the 2017 elections, the 'anti Romeo Squad' also made the Yogi government its biggest trump card
 lekin ek saal hote-hote anti romeo squad kaa namonishaan sarkari uplabdhiyon se gaayab he
 In the list of achievements of the Yogi government, the work and figures of the anti-romeo squad were not found, whereas the figures of the encounter squad have been replaced
 ladakiyon-mahilaon se chhedhkhani rokane ke liye bani thibataa den ki yogi ke satta sambhalate hi soobe main bijepi ne anti romeo squad banane ke vaade par amal kiya tha
 The BJP had said in the resolution letter to create an anti-romeo squad to stop molesting women
 police ne manchalon ko pakadaney or ladakiyon ke saath chhedhkhani ko rokane ke liye park, bheed-bhaad vaali jagah or skool-college ke baahar ye abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 Today one year of Yogi Sarkar's political journey has been completed
 sarkaar ne apni uplabdhiyon ke aankade pesh kiye hai
 But there is no discussion of anti-romeo squad
 ek saal baad ab sarkaar kaa daawa he ki anti romeo squad ke liye kendriyakrut yojana yani centrulij aplicoshan lagaaya jayega
 Encounter figures in place of Anti Romeo Squad, it is worth mentioning that when the government was formed in March 2017, Yogi Adityanath's government gave its go ahead to strengthen the anti Romeo squad and prevent the molestation of women in public places
 
 ek saal hote hote anti romeo squad ke aankade kam hote gaye jabaki encounter ke aankadon ne sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon main jagah le lee he
 Anti Romeo Squad Last year, the government announced the formation of an anti-romeo squad under the leadership of a sub-inspector in every police station, initially this squads were also seen in plain uniforms outside the squares and girls' school colleges, but day by week And as the months passed, the anti-romeo squad also lost its firepower
 vajah police bal kii baari kami rahi
 Under this anti Romeo squad, a team with 4 constables has been formed under a sub inspector in every police station, who used to keep an eye in plain uniform outside the girls' school college of every police station area, but after initial action, its unit is now visible
 Does not give
 kaagajon main jinda he anti romeo squadkagajon main aaj bhi anti romeo squad jinda he or lagbhag sabhi thanon main isaki ikai bani hui he
 But the reality today is that it has no sign in many police stations
 vajah he police bal kii baari kami
 However the police administration has been successful in stopping Moral policing in the name of anti Romeo squad
 lekin ab collejon ke baahar yah squad dikhaai nahin dete naa hi log isaki charchaa karte dikhte hai
 In the beginning, the Anti Romeo Squad was strictly dealt with by manipulations and molesters, many people were also caught in public
 haalanki moral pulising kii bhi kai ghatnaayen saamne ai thim lekin dhire dhire anti romeo squad sirf naam kaa rah gaya or iske log duusare police balon or thanon main tainaat hote gaye
 The anti-romeo squad figures have not been revealed for the last several months, but the government claims that the anti-romeo squad is doing well and will soon make many more changes
 anti romeo dal ne kaam karnaa shuru kiya to police kii karypranali par sawaal bhi uthe
 Perhaps this is the reason why later activity of such squads was less visible
 lekin yogi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon main iskaa zikr tak nahin he

 It is interesting to know that if the Reserve Bank cut interest rates in the election year, then the party in power won that year
 rigerv bank ne guuruuvaar ko is vitt varsh kii pehali maudrik niti samiksha main repo rate main chauthai fisadi kii katautee kii he
 This is a big relief for the middle class as houses, vehicles and industrial loans will become cheaper
 saal 2019 main rigerv bank byaaj daron main do baar katautee kar chukaa he
 This was the first review meeting of the financial year 2019-20 before the Lok Sabha elections and now there is no change in this till the elections are held
 yah katautee modi sarkaar ke liye bhi ek badi raahat he
 The decision of the Reserve Bank does not come under the purview of the Election Code of Conduct, so the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Review Committee (MPC) could take a comfortable decision in this regard
 rigerv bank ek vitt varsh main chah baar april, june, agast, oktober, disambar or farvari main apni maudrik niti kii samiksha karata he
 However, everyone is waiting for the April review, because this only determines a kind of stance for the entire financial year
 vaise to rigerv bank ke byaaj daron main maamuli katautee kaa janata ko bahut phayda nahin hota, kyonki bank iskaa phayda graahakon tak pahunchane se hichakate hai
 But looking at the results of the last three Lok Sabha elections, there seems to be a special trend

 In fact, some names are strongly disliked by girls
 britain main kiye gaye ek naye surveykshan se yah baat saamne ai he ki mahilaon ko ‘beb’, ‘sweetchiks’, ‘snukems’ or ‘maffin’ jaise naam itane zyada bure lagate hai ki vah inase nafrat karti hai
 Although the names of women who are fondly called by their love always seem bad, it is not so, they find the names like 'guardius', 'beautiful' and 'lovely' well
 kuch aise naam hai jinka americakaran kar diya gaya he jaise ‘baby girl’ or ‘baby doll’, inhen bhi kuch khaas pasand nahin kiya jaataa
 Similarly, names like 'pudding' and 'pumpkin' do not like women
 cytapiadatakam dwaara karaae gaye is adhyayan ke anusaar britain main paanch main se sirf ek vyakti apane saathi ko uske puure naam se pukaarata he
 Many people believed that he called his partner in the name of love when no one else was around
 kuch purush apane saathi ko ‘misses’ athwa ‘wif’ kahkar bulaate hai, jabaki har chah main se ek vyakti ne yah mana ki vah apane saathi ko ‘bos’ kehete hai
 Talking about India, if such a study is done here also, the number of women who get irritated when called by names like 'munni', 'baby', 'pappi', 'tito', 'kukku' and Guddi 'will not be reduced

 Gurus and teachers are being remembered across the country on the occasion of Teachers' Day on 5 September
 dilli samet kai jagahon par shikshakon ko sammanit kiya ja rahaa he, soshal media par apane skool or college ke shikshakon ko yaad karte hue post likhi ja rahi hai, kaiyon main apane shikshak kii tasviir ko saajha bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 But in the midst of all this, there are many people who are using this special day to draw attention to the plight of teachers
 hindi akhbaar dainik jaagran main chhapi khabar ke anusaar uttarakhand ke almoda main tristareey vyavastha lagu nahin hone kii maang ko lekar vahaan ke shikshakon ne shikshak diwas kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 At the same time, according to the BBC report, about four lakh employed teachers in Patna are celebrating Teacher's Day on Teachers' Day on the complaint of not getting salary for months
 angreji akhbaar indian express ne apane sampadakeey main ek sanvida shikshak kaa raashtrapati ke naam patr chapa he jisamen lekhak ne un halaat kaa zikr kiya he jiske tahat ek shikshak banane kaa sapana lekar chalaa vyakti mahaz 'aid hoque' banakar rah jaataa he
 In the festive atmosphere of Teacher's Day, such things can certainly spoil the taste, but even for one day, the teachers and gurus turn away from the current situation
 vaise isi din ke liye hindi ke diggaj vyangyakaar harishankar parasaai ne ek niabandh likhaa tha jiskaa sheershak tha 'shikshak sammaan se inkaar karen
 
 ' is lekh main parasaai likhte hai ki kis tarah 5 sitambar ke maukey par alag alag sansthaaen or club aadi ritred shikshakon ko dhund dhundhakar sammanit karte hai
 In an edited part of this essay, he writes, 'the fashion of honoring teachers has begun in the country on 5 September
 raashtrapati shikshakon ko sammanit karte hai to yah bhi sochate hai ki yah kaarykram acha rahegaa
 Will be printed in newspapers
 log janenge ki ham guru kii mahima jaanate hai or uskaa sammaan bhi karte hai
 If you understand that if the dacoits continue to surrender in the same manner and such dignified films continue to be made, then later, the birthday of the robber Emperor Mansingh will be celebrated as Dasyu Day
 maansingh apane kshetra main radhakrishnan se kam yogya or sammanit nahin tha
 Then there will be an 'adulteration day', 'black marketing day', 'smuggling day', 'bribery day'
 shikshak diwas to isliye jabardastee chal rahaa he kyonki dow radhakrishnan raashtrapati rahe
 Teacher's day would not have been celebrated if he had been merely a great teacher
 ' tippaniyan Keeping another hand on the problems of the teachers, Parsai writes in another part of this essay, 'september 5 is the humiliation day of teachers
 jhooth he, paakhand he
 Poor teacher is ridiculed
 prahasan he
 Will not pay salary properly
 subhite nahin denge
 We will make owls with respect
 is desh ke shikshakon ko paanch sitambar ko sammaan karwaane se inkaar kar dena chahie
 If people call, then teacher should not make us respect ourselves
 aap jabardastee karenge to ham police main report kar denge
 ' dilachasp baat yah he ki parasaai dwaara kaaphi pehle likhaa ja chukaa yah lekh vartmaan daur main kaaphi praasangik he
 There are many problems related to teachers in the development of the country
 aage ummid hi kii ja sakati he ki ane vaale samay main parasaai kaa likhaa yah niabandh apraasangik hota chalaa jaae, tab tak jhootha hi sahi 'happy teachers de'
 
 
 According to the news published in the Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran, teachers have boycotted Teacher's Day in Uttarakhand's Almora demanding the implementation of a three-tier system
 vahiin bibisi kii report ke mutabik patna main kareeb chaar lakh niojit shikshak maheenon-maheenon se vetan na milane kii shikaayat ko lekar shikshak diwas ke din 'shikshak apmaan diwas' manaa rahe hai
 The English newspaper Indian Express has printed a letter to the President of a contract teacher in its editorial, in which the author has mentioned the circumstances under which a person who dreams of becoming a teacher becomes merely 'ad hoc'
 shikshak diwas ke utsavi maahaul main is tarah kii baaten yakeenan swaad bigaad sakati hai lekin ek din ke liye shikshakon or guruon kii maujuuda halaat se munh pher lene se bhi 
 However, on this day, Hindi satirist Harishankar Parsai wrote an essay titled 'teachers Refuse Honor'
 
 In this article, Parsai writes how on the occasion of September 5, different institutions and clubs etc
 find and honor retired teachers
 is niabandh ke ek sampadit hisse main vah likhte hai 'desh main paanch sitambar ko shikshakon ko sammanit karne kaa fishan chal padaa he
 If the President honors teachers, he also thinks that this program will be good
 akhabaaron main chhapega
 People will know that we know the glory of the Guru and also respect him
 aap samaj lijie ki agar daakuon kaa isi tarah shaan se aatmasamarpan hota rahaa or aisi hi garimapurna filmein banati raheen to aage chalakar daaku samraat maansingh kaa janmdiwas dasyu diwas ke rup main manaaya jayega
 Mansingh was no less qualified and respected than Radhakrishnan in his field
 phir ek 'milavati diwas' hoga, 'kalabazari diwas', 'taskari diwas', 'ghoosekhor diwas' hoga
 Teacher's Day is going on because Dr
 Radhakrishnan was the President
 agar vah sirf mahaan adhyaaapak maatr rahe hote to shikshak diwas nahin manaaya jaataa
 Comments shikshakon kii samasyaon par maano haath rakhte hue isi niabandh ke ek or hisse main parasaai likhte hai 'paanch sitambar shikshakon kaa apmaan diwas he
 Lies, hypocrisy
 garib adhyaaapak kaa uphaas he
 Is a farce
 vetan thik nahin denge
 We will not give good news
 sammaan karke ullu banaaenge
 Teachers of this country should refuse to be honored on 5 September
 log bulaaen to shikshak kah den hamen apana sammaan nahin karwaanaa
 If you force, we will report to the police
 ' Interestingly, this article, written long ago by Parsai, is very relevant in the present era
 desh ke vikaas main shikshakon se judi kai samasyaayein jyon kii tyon hai
 It can only be hoped that this essay written by Parsai will become irrelevant in the coming times, till then falsely 'happy Teachers' Day'

 The Mahila Suraksha Dal project of the Arvind Kejriwal government, which sought votes on the issue of women's safety in the Delhi Assembly elections, is now seen to be in a shambles
 dilli ke liye kejariwal sarkaar ne tisare bajet main mahila suraksha force ke liye kisi tarah ke fund kaa prastaav nahin diya he
 In response to the question, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that the Women's Protection Force and its functioning fall under the Delhi Police
 isaki vajah se project puraa nahin ho paaya
 The police of Delhi is under the Central Government
 sisodiya ne kaha ki jahaan tak bason main mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye marshalon kii tainaati kaa maamla he
 For this, Home Guards have been deployed in Marshall buses
 saath hipayalat projectake tahat kai ilaakon main mohalla rakshak dal bhi tainaat kiye gaye hai
 They admit that the Women's Protection Force case did not go ahead
 sisodiya ke mutabik maamla dilli main kanoon vyavastha or police se juda he
 Being a union territory of Delhi, it does not have the rights to form such a force
 haalanki sarkaar is maamle ko lekar police ke saath baatcheet karne kii bhi baat kar rahi he
 Not only this, no proposal has been kept in the budget for CCTV camera project
 vahiin is bajet main dilli mahila ayog ke bajet ko teen guna badhaayaa gaya he
 Sisodia mentioned that CCTV cameras are being installed
 saath hi project par kaam chal rahaa he
 But the biggest question in this whole debate is whether the Kejriwal government is reversing its promise on creating a women security force
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii mahatvakankshi yojana neshnal health protection skim yani ayushmaan bharat ko buudhvaar shaam ko kendriya cabinet ne manjuuri de di
 The scheme was announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in this year's General Budget
 is yojana ko modicare bhi kaha jaataa he
 The cabinet has also agreed to continue the National Health Mission
 yah yojana 31 march 2020 tak chalegi or centre sarkaar iske liye 85,217 karod rupee kharch karegi
 The cabinet meeting also approved amendments to the Surrogacy (regulation) Bill
 yah bill sarogesi ko niyantrit karne ke makasad se laayaa gaya he
 Talking about Ayushman Bharat, there is also a proposal to create an authority to monitor this scheme
 centre sarkaar is skim kaa 60 fisadi or rajya sarkaar 40 fisadi kharch vahan karegi
 What is special in Ayushman India? Under this scheme every family will get health insurance up to Rs 5 lakh
 isamen parivaar ke sadasyon kii sankhya par koi roak nahin he
 The decision of which families will come under this scheme will be based on the economic basis
 is yojana ke daayre main aane vaale pariwaron ko sarkari or chune hue privet aspataalon main ilaaj kii suvidha milegi
 Families who come under this scheme will be able to get treatment facilities anywhere across the country
 kya he ayushmaan bharat yojanabata den ki vitt mantri arun jetali ne is saal pesh kiye gaye bajet main duniya kii sabase badi swasthya yojana 'ayushmaan bharat' kaa elaan karte hue kaha tha ki iske tahat kareeb 10 karod pariwaron ko salanaa 5 lakh rupee kaa medical cover bhi diya jayega
 Also, 40% of the country's population i
e
 50 crore people will get the benefit of this scheme
 isamen nijee kshetra kii companiyaan bhi bhaag le sakengi
 Jaitley had said during the budget speech that India will be made a healthy India, for this 1 all over the country
 5 lakh swasthya centre khole jaaenge
 The benefit of opening these health centers will be immediate to the common people, as they will not have to go far for treatment of common diseases and will be able to get treatment from these centers nearby
 saath hi aarogy se judi suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa karai jaaengi
 The benefit of initial treatment will be given to the common people
 Insurance of Rs 5 lakh will be given when the patient is admitted to the hospital in case of major or serious illness, but the health centers will get immediate benefit to all types of sick people, big and small
 ab tak desh main ek swasthya centre se duusare swasthya centre ke bich kaaphi duuri hoti thi, lekin dedh lakh nae swasthya kendron ke aa jane kii surat main biimaar logon ke liye ghar ke kareeb hi ilaaj karana sulabh ho jayega
 Especially for people living in remote and rural areas
 unki mahange nijee hospital par nirbharta kam hogi
 If new doctors and new health centers come from new colleges, then doctors will also be needed
 aise main sarkaar ne desh main doctoron kii kami ko dur karne kii badi yojana banaai he or iske liye puure desh main 24 jila hospitalon ko apgrade karte hue medical college main tabdeel kar diya jayega
 Along with treatment in these medical colleges, new doctors will also be prepared
 aaj kii taarikh main bharat main doctor or marij ke bich baari antar dikhataa he or yah anupaat he 1:1700 kaa he, jabaki vishwa swasthya sanghathan (WHO) ke anusaar 400 marijon par ek doctor hone chahie
 Under the new scheme, every 3 parliamentary constituencies or at least one medical college will be opened in a state
 philhal desh main nijee or sarkari donon medical collejon se har saal 67 hajaar embibies or 31 hajaar post graduate doctor paas hokar nikalate hai
 In such a situation, with the opening of many new medical colleges, the shortage of doctors will be removed and enough doctors will be able to treat people
 eemarai samooh ke udyogpati es ke todi sahit chah logon ko aspataal main aag lagane ke baad dam ghutane se 89 logon kii maut ke maamle main giraftaar karne ke saath hi aspataal kaa license radd kar diya gaya
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banarti said, 'my announcement that the culprits will be arrested, six people including SK Todi have been arrested
 ’unhone kaha, ‘kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Those responsible for so many deaths will be dealt with seriously
 ’unhone kaha ki damakal seva adhikari or police gat sitambar main eemarai aspataal prashasan ko uske tahkhaane ke bare main chetavanee di thi
 He said, 'AMRI had given the promise but did not fulfill it
 ’ mukhyamantri ne kaha ki rashtriya aapadaa karrwai bal kaa dal aspataal ke tahkhaane ko vikiran li ke liye jaanch kii
 Along with this, forensic experts will also investigate this

 The matter is May 31
 rahul gandhi party ke apane sahyogiyon ke saath purvi bharat ke kuch rajyon ke daure kii yojana bana rahe the
 At the same time he came to notice that elections in Kerala and Assam are to be held by May next year
 ye ve rajya hai jahaan congress satta main he
 He asked the leaders present in the room to chalk out a strategy for these two states and other states where elections are to be held
 16 april ko apni 56 dinon kii chhuttiyon se laute rahul ko dedh maheenaa ho chukaa tha
 In these six weeks, Rahul emerged as the most vocal opponent of the Narendra Modi government inside and outside Parliament
 haalanki unhone net nutrality se lekar madhyam varg kii awaas chintaaon or daliton ke adhikaron tak kai tarah ke mudde uthaae, lekin unke hamalon kii disha mukchay rup se kisaanon kii chintaaon par modi kii kathith upeksha ke chaaron ore gumti rahi he
 In these weeks of action, some of Rahul's attempts to surround the government have had the opposite effect
 jaise unke apane sansadeey kshetra amethi main food park kaa mudda
 But it cannot be denied that slowly, from the 'congress side', a wind has been gaining momentum and Congress leaders are excited to see that the party has acquired the role of the main opposition party, that status Which was handed over to parties like the Trinamool Congress in the first six months of the NDA government
 congress ke communication cell ke prabharee randeep singh surajevaala kehete hai, "aaj narendra modi ko chunauti dene vaale sirf rahul gandhi hai
 "there is no denying this in the party
 lekin unka sawaal yah he ki jab rahul congress kaa chunavi bhagya palatney ke liye ranneeti taiyaar karenge, vah pal kitni 'jaldi' aayega
 Party stalwarts like Kamal Nath believe that Rahul is currently doing his homework
 ve kehete hai, "aane vaale maheenon main ham kuch faisle dekhenge
 "but his critics have heard it all before
 jaisaa ki party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, "karnataka cabinet main pherbadal saal bhar se adhik samay se lataka padaa he, rahul chah maah se kehete aa rahe hai ki unhen assam main kuch sudharatmak karrwai karne kii jarurat he
 In Kerala, the Congress is divided between the Chief Minister and the State Congress President
 jamini str par koi rajnatik karrwai najar nahin aati he
 "yet even these leaders do not deny that the words and freshness of Rahul's footsteps have helped draw attention to the party
 is shor-gul ko paidaa karne ke liye do stareey ranneeti ko kaam main laayaa gaya he
 In the 45-day tour of seven states since his return, the media has started paying attention to the Congress with Rahul's forced attacks and his footsteps, while the 20-member social media team is quietly supporting his rhetoric
 19 may tak congress kaa fasebuk pej 'angesement' ke maamle main bijepi se behatar pradarshan kar chukaa he (dekhen graphic)
 While the Congress is far behind the huge followers of BJP and Modi on Twitter, on youtube (in which media briefings and videos of speeches of various leaders are being put on a regular basis) till May 25, it is bjp's 2
 32 karod darshakon ke mukaable 1
 With 89 million viewers, the ruling party is giving a tough fight
 party ke soshal media dal ke pramukh deependra hooda kehete hai, "fasebuk ke 'likes' or twitor par folbers nakli yaa kharide hue ho sakate hai
 But the engagement rate of youtube videos and the videos being watched is real
 " twitor apnaane vaale shuruaati logon main se shaamil or is madhyam par apane aap main hasti tiruanantpuram ke saansad shashi tharur kehete hai ki media or soshal media sirf jamini vaastaviktaaon ko pratibimbit karata he
 Overall, everything is going well

 They feel that the Congress leadership has taken little action in regaining the electoral ground
 ab se ek varsh ke bheetar chah rajyon—bihar, assam, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, kerala or puducheri main chunaav hone hai
 Assembly elections are due in Punjab in 2017
 lekin rajya ikaayiyon main asantosh, gathbandhan taiyaar karne ke maamle main najar aane laayak chunavi ganit kaa abhaav or rajya ke sabhi maamalon par alaakaman kii or vishesh rup se rahul kii chuppi, in rajyon main congress samarthakon ke bich aam charchaa kaa vishay hai
 In Bihar, for example, the party seems to have decided to form an alliance with the Janata Parivar, which itself is in a wavering condition
 haalanki rajya netritv ke ek dhade ne iskaa virodh kiya he
 Even Rahul initially wanted to contest the October election alone, but sources say he has now softened up to the idea of joining hands with Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav
 tark yah diya gaya haih yah vah keemat he jo modi kaa rath rokane ke liye congress ko chukaani hogi
 The setback in Bihar after the defeat in Delhi will surely end Modi's glare and the Congress will benefit the most in future, which is the most viable all-india alternative
 samasya yah he ki isse har koi sahamat nahin hai
 Many believe that the Congress will continue to be a weak partner in the Bihar coalition and, as a Lok Sabha MP says, "will end up under the umbrella of the RJD and JD (U)"
 sutron kaa maananaa he ki party ke saamne assam main dobaaraa satta main lautne kii sambhaavna bahut damdaar he—jahaan teji se ubharne ke baad bijepi bangladesh ke saath bhoomi adla-badali samjhauta or bade baandh kii pariyojnaon par palati maarane ke kaaran raste se bhatak chuki he
 The party is also expected to win in Punjab, where a strong anti-incumbency against the ruling Badal family is being felt
 in donon rajyon main—ek saal se adhik samay se punjab main or teen saal se assam main—congress gutiy jhagadon kii vajah se surkhiyon main zyada rahati he
 Despite this, senior party leaders allege that the party high command has not made any effort to resolve the conflict
 purv kendriya mantri manish tiwari kehete hai, "bheed jutanaa or chunavi ganit, donon kaa alag-alag tantra he
 The two are often not helpful to each other
 jahaan endie ke khilaaf rajnatik lamabandi jari rakhi jaani chahie, vahiin jahaan tak chunavi ganit kaa sawaal he, jab tak vishwasaneey rashtriya or rajya str ke netaa aage nahin laae jate hai, tab tak koshishon kii safalataa bahut alag dhang kii rah sakati he
 "there is a slight dissatisfaction in the states where elections are to be held, there is also a problem of lack of reliable leaders, which the leaders of these states also accept
 congress ke ek rajyasabha saansad kehete hai, "koi anya vipakshi dal aisa nahin he, jiskaa puure assam main prabhaav ho
 In such a situation, if the high command ends the anti-incumbency against Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and tackles infighting, the Congress can easily come back
 " 2011 main gogoi ke bete or loksabhaa saansad gaurav assam kii raajnneeti main achaanak aae the, or uske baad se party main avyavashtha ke liye rajya ke kai netaa gaurav ko doshi tehraate aae hai
 Junior Gogoi is widely held responsible for a public dispute with his father's former trusted partner Hemant Biswa Sarma
 hemanth ne 2013 main cabinet se istipha de diya tha
 The major concern for the state Congress leaders is that since then the Chief Minister has repeatedly failed to win the election
 ek mantri kehete hai, "ham loksabhaa chunaav main buree tarah haare or is varsh farvari main nagar nigam ke chunaavon main bijepi ne hamase behatar pradarshan kiya he
 We have to bring back Hemant, who won Assam not only in 2011, but also Manipur in 2012 and Mizoram in 2013
 "gogoi or unke bete ko ab bhi rahul kaa samarthan hasil he
 Elegant and outspoken Gaurav has impressed the Congress leaders of Delhi to the extent that many consider him the most popular youth leader of Assam

 The story is no different in Punjab as well, even as rebel-turned-former chief minister Amarinder Singh is hinting at a late reconciliation
 is baat kii sambhaavna nahin he ki rahul pradesh party adhyaksh pratap singh bajva ko barkhaast kar denge or prabhaar die jane kii amarinder kii maang maan lenge
 It is likely that when the elections are held in 2017, the MP from Amritsar will be comforted as an election campaign in-charge

 "what is happening on the organizational front may not be visible from day one," he says, but Rahul is regularly taking feedback on electoral strategy, alliances and other issues
 " camel nath kii tarah ve bhi nishcint hai ki jaruri nirnay 'sahi samay par' le liye jaaenge
 Right now, Rahul is said to be waiting for the party's organizational elections to be completed by July
 unke sahyogi kehete hai ki tab tak rahul 15 rajyon kaa apana daura bhi puraa kar lenge or party ke liye vyapak tasviir kaa andaaj laga chuke honge
 If sources are to be believed, it will be a big decision at the top level in Delhi before the state level decision
 congress main charchaa he ki rahul khud party main sheersh sthaan par jane ke liye chunavi rasta apnaanaa chaahate hai
 If this is true, it is likely to happen by the end of next month — and it is likely to be the most comfortable power transfer in the party in the past 50 years, as there is no possibility of any candidate opposing him

 ''aatankiyon par karrwai karne par behaal hogi sahaytaunhone kaha ki is samay america pakistan ke saath sahyog karne ko praathamikta detaa he or ise lekar ashanvit bhi he
 Meanwhile, Defense Minister Jim Mattis said that if Pakistan takes action against terrorist organizations, the US will restore the prevented security assistance
 aatankwaad par karrwai main pakistan sarkaar or sena main tanaav badhalmerica ke ek sheersh adhikari ne kaha ki pakistan main sarkaar or sena ke bich tanaav he
 Because of this, the US is unable to negotiate concrete with Pakistan to combat terrorism
 pakistan main sarkaar or sena ke bich tanaav ke chalate aatankiyon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin ho rahi he
 The official said that the US would continue to partner with both the Government of Pakistan and the military leadership

 input- aaraje alok Delhi Women's Commission has rescued 3 innocent girls from the clutches of a fraudulent company in the name of placements
 ayog ke mutabik placement company aksar jharkhand se kam umr kii ladakiyon ko dilli main naukari ke liye lekar aate hai
 But the complaint received from 6 families revealed that the girls were kept in a room and were beaten up
 'ajtak' se exclusive baatcheet main ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne bataaya ki dilli mahila ayog ko parivaar ne 181 par kol kar jaankaree di ki inke bete or betiyon ko jharkhand seek placement company uthakarle gai he
 For 3 years, the placement company did not let the children talk to the family living in Jharkhand
 swati maliwal ke mutabik shikaayat ke baad dilli mahila ayog ne ek jaal bichaaya jiske tahat maanav taskar ko akshardham ke paas bulaakar dabocha or police ko saunp diya
 Although a woman running this business has been arrested but her son is out of the hold
 philhal 3 ladakiyon ko kaid se chhudaa liya gaya he lekin 3 ladkiyaan ab bhi gaayab hai
 Swati Maliwal further states that the girls are very young, so they are appearing in the Child Welfare Committee
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki maanav taskari karne vaale shaks ne in parivaar ke logon ke ghar jaakar khuli dhamkee di he
 The man has threatened to rape and murder the family members
 dilli mahila ayog kaa kahana he ki puure maamle mendiseepi ko notice jarikar rahe hai
 In this, the police are asking questions that why human traffickers have not been arrested so far? At the same time, the police is demanding from the Commission that by adding all the clauses in the FIR, the name of that man smuggler should also be included, and this family of Jharkhand should be given protection
 ayog kii chif swati maliwal ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet main daawa kiya ki dilli main bahut sari aisi placement companiyaan hai jo bina kisi niyam ko maanate hue dhadlle se chal rahi hai
 These companies are getting girls from 8, 9, 12 and 13 years old working in Delhi from other states
 halaat yah hai ki in bacchon ko apane parivaar se baatcheet nahi karne di ja rahi he
 How the children are tortured, the matter is under investigation
 peedit pita ne bhi apana dard jaahir karte hue bataaya ki unka parivaar garib he is naate apni beti ko shahar main rupye kamaane ke liye bhej diya tha
 But according to the victim's father, for 3 years neither salary nor girl has been talked to
 pita kaa kahana he ki unke parivaar ko dhamkee di ja rahi he ki agar ladki ko jharkhand lekar gaye to hatya kar denge
 a woman from the victim's family said that the placement company was greedy for money
 bacchon kii selary maangane par company ke log manaa kar dete the
 Neither phone number was given and no phone conversation is conducted
 teen baar parivaar ke log bacchiyon se milane aaye lekin unhen rupye nahi die gaye to bina tikat ke train se jharkhand lautnaa padaa
 The woman further stated that she has seen with her own eyes that the girl who does not work is beaten a lot by closing the room, intensifying the sound of TV
 peedit parivaar kii mahila ne ek hairaan karne vaala khulaasa kiya
 The woman said that a girl had come from Jharkhand, her health suddenly worsened and her leg was swollen
 jab ladki kii haalat gambhir ho gai tab uskidavaai karaane kisi aspataal lege the
 Then one day her family was called and told that the girl ran away with a boy and later the girl's body was found
 mahila kaa aarope he ki use dhamkee dekar kaha ja rahaa he ki agar dilli main najar ai to balaatkaar or murder kar denge
 Delhi Women's Commission will demand from the government that strict laws should be made for placement companies and strict action should be taken on the companies which are doing wrong work
 saath hi ayog un logon ke khilaaf bhi karrwai kii maang kar rahaa he jo in bacchon ko apni kothiyon main rakhte hai or inke saath galat vyavhaar karte hai
