 saanchaa:neucleic amla Samhita literally means collection
 at: vidhiniyamon kaa lipibaddh rup hi, saamaanya arthon main, vidhisanhita kehalaata he
 This has been considered to be a very high level in the development of laws because a written collection of laws is possible only when the form of those rules has been fixed and has become universally accepted
 saamaajik vikascram main saamaajik sambandhon kaa niyaman kramash: daivi aadesh, lokareeti dwaara hona mana gaya he
 Therefore, it is clear that these three levels must have been crossed before the laws are codified
 vidhiniyamon ko lipibaddh karne kii aavashyaktaa kadachit tab padi hogi jab ek vyapak kshetra kii sthaneey lokaritiyon main ekarupata laana jaruri ho gaya hoga
 In order that knowledge of duty should be available to all, this desire must also have been the motivator of codification
 samhitakaran kaa uddeshy roodhi ke sthaan par lipibaddh vidhi niyam ko hi lokvyavahaar kaa aadhaar bananaa hota he
 But it is clear from the form of early legislations available to us that those codes are collections of erstwhile folklore
 or yah bhi ki vidhiniyamon ko lipibaddh karne ke baad bhi lokaritiyon se purna mukti uplabdh nahin ho saki, kyonki un sangruhit vidhiniyamon ko vyavhaar main lokareeti ke hi anusaar laayaa ja saktaa he
 The history of legislatures is available to us from two to two and a half thousand years before Christ

 In the modern sense, the term legislative can be given to the same legislature which encompasses the entire Act and does not require any other basis for the enactment of those Acts
 saamaanya sanvidhi or vidhisanhita main antar ke teen aadhaar he
 The general act may relate to the entirety of a subject while the legislative legislatures have all the current legislations stored in one place
 vidhisanhita main niyamon kaa sangrah subodhta kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, vargeekrut ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Along with the simplicity of the language, care is also taken in the law collection so that even if the form of the rules is not exhausted from the elaborate faults, multi-fault defects cannot come in it

 vidhisanhita ke itihaas main "roman tvilv tabills" kaa mahatv akshunn he
 Firstly because it is an example of the classical form of legalism and secondly because its developed form is circulated in almost all the nations of Europe in the form of objective codes

 This defect was corrected by Justinian and the entire code was scientifically divided into four parts - Institutes Digest, Codex and Novels respectively

 For example, in the 13th century, Spanish language known as Alphonso Code had the same meaning in Spanish language

 After the creation of the "code Civil" in France in the early 19th century and other codes relating to penalties, crime, trade, etc
, these new codes became the guiding point for other future legislatures, as the more developed legislation of the French codes was more suited to modern conditions
 And their division and language was more simple and understandable
 yahan yah ullekhneey he ki japan, swetzland tathaa turki ne apni vidhisanhitaon kii prerana france se na lekar germany kii vidhisanhita "gasetj vush" se lee
 The law of England is called the "common law" system unlike the Roman law, that is, the principles contained in the judgments of judges are laws

 In the 19th century, Jeremy Bentham overemphasized the need for codification of the law
 us andolan kaa fal swayan apane desh main prakat hone ke pehle bharat main prakat hua or uski safalataa spasht hone ke baad england main bhi vah prayaas aarambh hua
 Although there is still no legal practice and the common law is still applicable in some areas, yet in a much wider area, the method passed by the law is now available in a written form
 america main bhi saamaanya vidhivyavastha he
 In the 19th century there too, Edward Livingston and David Dudley Field emphasized the need for codification of law
 rajya ke vidhinirmaataa ang ke purna viksit hone ke baad bhavi vidhirachana to spashtatya lipibaddh hi hoti he kintu saamaanya vidhiniyamon ko bhi vyavasthit rup main lipibaddh karne kaa prayaas 1923 main american laa instichut" kii sthapana kar prarambh kiya gaya
 In China too, statutes were often written in writing from the very beginning

 However, the code now available is known as "code of Ting" - 600 AD
 praaia: vahi samhita "maanchu code" ke naam se 17veen shatabdi main prachlit thi
 It has also been translated into English
 vartmaan china kii vidhivyavastha kaa purna parichay abhi nahin mil sakaa he
 The word Code gives no indication of the source of the statutes stored therein
 bharat main vidhiniyamon ke aise sangrah ko samhita ke atirikt "smriti" ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The word "memory" also clarifies the source of the statutes

 But this stream is unidirectional
 yadi pattica ko runagra kii apeksha dhan vibhav par rakhaa jaay to, jaisaa upar likhaa ja chukaa he, electron dhara pravaahit ho jaati he
 But if the voltage is applied in the other direction, that is, if the plate is at the negative potential rather than the minus, then the electron current will not flow at all, because electrons will not come out of the plate without heating the plate
 is kaaran nalee main electron dhara keval ek hi disha main pravaahit kii ja sakati he
 If the source of the alternating current is diverted across a series of bipolar and electrical loads, such as a resistor, through a series connection, the current will flow only in one direction and no current will flow in half the cycle of the alternator

 At first the filler current rises slowly, then some quickly and finally settles, which is called saturated current
 yah santrupti antaran aavesh ke kaaran ho jaati he, jo bhatke hue electranon ke kaaran runagra ke nikat prakat ho jaataa he
 The filler current in bipolar can be represented by the following equation: isamen Ip = dwidhruvi main pattic dhara; k = the constant that depends on the geometry of the tube; v = dwidhruvi kii pattic voltata As mentioned above, in bipolar the current flows in only one direction
 is kaaran is nalee kaa upyog prayavarti dhara ke rujukaran main kiya jaataa he
 In this, the alternating current is converted into direct current
 isko 'ardh tarang rujukaran' kehete hai
 Those dipoles, which are used in the desorption of high voltage reversal current, are called cannatrans
 gasayukt dwidhruvi kaa upyog shaktishaalee dhara ke rujukaran main kiya jaataa he, udhaahrant: sanchayak badariyon ko aaveshtit karne main tungar rujukari ek gasayukt rujukari he
 Leiben made an important discovery in Germany and Lee the Forest in America
 unhone dwidhruvi ke donon dhruvon ke madhya ek atirikt dhruv laga diya or yah paaya ki is prakaar kii nalee, jise tridhruvi kehete hai, bahut hi laabhakaari he
 In the absence of this third pole, as stated earlier, the thermogenic current in the tube flows only when the material is at a voltage potential rather than a positive minus
 isko pattic dhara kehete hai
 This increases along with the band voltage until the transfer charge appears
 uske prakat ho jane par yah sthir ho jaati he, arthath pattic dhara pattic voltata ke badhane par nahin badhati
 When the third pole is placed between the two poles of the tube, it starts controlling this transfer charge
 is kaaran grid ko antaran-aavesh-niyantrak kah sakate hai
 If the grid potential is less than the negative potential, the grid throws the electrons backwards and the filler current decreases
 yadi grid vibhav runagra vibhav se adhik rahata he to pattic dhara bad jaati he
 Then, another advantageous feature is the change in grid current with grid current or grid voltage
 grid dhara athwa grid voltata main thodaa hi parivartan pattic dhara main paryaapt parivartan laa saktaa he
 This device is used in amplifiers
 pattic dhara teen swantatra charon par nirbhar rahati he
 They are the band voltage, grid voltage, and voltage used to heat the negative
 jab ushma voltata ko itnaa adhik badha diya jaataa he ki paryaapt utsarjan hone lage, to dhara keval antaran aavesh ke niyantrit hoti he
 Then the band voltage is the function of only two independent variables
 ve hai plate voltata or grid voltata
 This function cannot be represented by a curve in a plane
 yah tri-ymik sataha main hi pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Although special information can be obtained from this type of curve, there is a lot of inconvenience to display it
 is kaaran isko teen prakaar kii vakr rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he jinhen sthir lakshanik kehete hai
 A) are jaisaa bataaya ja chukaa he, tridhruvi kaa mukhya upyog pravardhakon main hota he
 It is also used in the forms of dolka, rujukari, introductory and sculpture
 ucch aavriti-pravardhan-kriya main tridhruvi ke prayog se yah haani hoti he ki pattic or grid ke bich ke madhyadhruvi dharitra ke kaaran donon ke paripath yugmit ho jate hai
 Because of this the function of the triploid at high frequency becomes unstable
 is yugman ke kaaran valve dolan utpann karne lagata he, jisase besuri dhwani aane lagati hai
 This disruptive fraction is overcome by placing another grid in the quadrilateral between the positive and the grid
 is grid ko dhan vibhav par rakhte hai
 This voltage is less than the potential of the plate
 is grid kii upasthiti main dhanagar paripath tathaa grid paripath yugmit nahin hote or dolan nahin utpann hota
 This grid is called the cover grid
 aavaran grid kii upasthiti se ek or laabh hota he
 Cationic electrons are less conscious in controlling drift than triploids, because the casing grid is more effective than the positive ones due to the nearness of the negative
 isse pravardhan bad jaataa he
 In quadrilaterals, control grids and arrays are set up in the same way as trident
 isliye donon hi naliyon main grid-pattic chaalakata praaia: samaan hoti hai parantu chaturdhruvi main pattic pratirodh rtridhruvi kii apeksha paryaapt adhik hota he
 The reason for this, as noted above, is the minimal effect of the filler current on the band voltage
 chaturdhruvi ke upyog main ek dosha he
 This is secondary emission of plaque
 pattic se jab atyant vegagami tapayanic electron takaraate hai to pattic se gaun utsarjan hone lagata he
 Due to the emission of secondary electrons from the fillet and being attracted towards the mantle, there is a spasm in the affluent morphology
 is anthan ke kaaran nalee main vikruti tathaa asthirataa aa jaati he
 To overcome this, a third grid is placed between the casing grid and the positive
 is grid ko damankaaree grid kehete hai tathaa is nalee ko, jisamen paanch dhrav hote hai, panchadhruvi kehete hai
 The oppressive grid is often interrelated with the debt
 iskaa kaary gaun utsarjan electron ko dabaanaa he
 The presence of a repressive grid on the main electron current has no specific effect
 yah keval gaun utsarjan kaa avrodh karata he
 Panchpolar is mostly used in high frequency irradiated amplification
 is nalee ne praaia: radio-aavriti-vibhav-pravardhak main chaturdhruvi ke upyog ko visthapit kar diya he
 The reason for this is that the use of Panchdhruvi leads to high potential amplification at medium-plate-potential
 panchadhruvi tathaa chaturdhruvi main kabhi-kabhi niyantrak grid ko ek vishesh abhipraay se ek samaan nahin banaate
 Grids at both ends reduce the spacing of the wires
 is prakaar kii nalee bahut si naliyon ke samaantar samooh ke rup main kaary karti he or in naliyon ke bhinn bhinn pravardhan-gunankhand hote hai
 As soon as the grids convert the voltage to negative, the high amplitude-section portions of the grid are cut off and do not carry the electron current, but have no effect on the other parts
 yadi grid rinatmak he to is bhaag se bhi ilekatron dhara bah sakati he
 Therefore, the electron current is usually constant and the amplification multiplication section changes
 is prakaar kii nalee ko char-pra-nalee kehete hai
 It is mostly used in the circuits of a self-propelled announcer
 chaturdhruvi tathaa panchadhruvi banane ke uparaant yah bodh hua ki aavaran grid tathaa pattic ke bich ke antaran aavesh kaa upyog gaun utsarjan ke baadhak ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 This is why the transfer charge is used in the pulp tube
 helical niyantrak grid tathaa aavaran grid ke taratv ko samaan rakhaa jaataa he or unke taron ko is prakaar lagaaya jaataa he ki un electranon ko ek belanaakaar sataha main ekatra kar den jo pattic tathaa aavaran grid ke bich main hon
 For this reason, this cylindrical surface is at the potential of the minuscule and throws back the electrons emitted from the fillet
 is prakaar yah gaun utsarjan ko rokane main safal hoti he
 Occasionally some special capacitance tubes attach oppressive grids to one side, but the cylindrical surface created by the charge charge is particularly effective in preventing secondary emission
 punjashkti nalee kaa pattic lakshanik main yah visheshta he ki vah adhik tikshnata se mudati he
 For this reason Punjashakti Hose is better than a Panchdhruvi
 vakrarekha kaa mode bahut hi tikshn hai or iske pashchaat vah praaia: sidhi he
 The horizontal portion of the curvilinear is accompanied by a substantial portion of the change in fillet voltage
 is kaaran is nalee kaa upyog karne se adhik shakti milti he
 Due to this special way of wiring, the casing-grid-stream is less than the filler current in panchpulvi
 dwidhruvi, tridhruvi, chaturdhruvi tathaa panchadhruvi ke vibhinn mail jab ekahi kaksh main banaae jate hai to unhen bahu-ikai-nalee kehete hai
 The characteristics of such polypolar or polycystic tubes are not very different from those that have been studied
 tathaapi aisi bhi bahudhruvi naliyaan hai jinamein keval ek hi runagra tathaa keval ek hi dhanagar rahata he, parantu grid teen se adhik rahete hai
 There are two control grids in such tubes and the control of the filtered current is done by the combination of both the voltages
 duusare gridon kaa kaary yaa to aavaran kaa hota he yaa pattic se gaun utsarjan ko dabaane kaa hota he, jaisaa chaturdhruvi tathaa panchadhruvi main hota he
 Sometimes the work of a grid, which rests on the money potential, is in the form of a supporting plate
 is pattic kii dhara kisi ek niyantrak grid kii voltata par nirbhar rahati he
 If there are two control grids in this type of tube and the voltages of both are changed, then the change of the filler current is proportional to the common factor of the change of voltage of both the grids
 is gunankriya ne is prakaar kii naliyon ko un paripathon main upyogi bana diya he jahaan vishesh prakaar ke murchak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The main use of multipolar electron tubes is in frequency conversion, that is, to change the voltage of one frequency to the voltage of another frequency
 iskaa udhaaharan ek panchagrid mishrak he
 In addition, multipolar tubes are being used, in particular, in automatic conduction control and oscillator, in which the voltage across one controller grid is controlled by the voltage in the other controller grid

 Aapitus is the third largest satellite of Saturn, the sixth planet in our solar system
 aapitas saura mandal ke saare upgrahon main se gyarahavaan sab se bada upgrah he
 It was discovered in 1671 by Italian astronomer Giovanni Cassini
 aapitas is baat ke liye mashhoor he ke uske ek bhaag kaa rang kaafii halkaa he or dusre bhaag kaa rang bahut hi gadha he
 Just in the center line of this satellite, a raised rock is seen which runs for half of this moon
 aapitas kaa ghanatv kaafii kam he or vaigyanik anumaan lagate hai ke isamen sirf 20% pathar he or baaqi sab pani kii barf he
 Aapitus is spelled "iapetus" in English
 aapitas pracheen unani dharmik kathaon kaa ek paatr tha
 The diameter of Aapitus is approximately 1,490 km
 tulana ke liye prithvi ke chandramaa kaa vyas lagbhag 3,470 kimi he, yani aapitas se lagbhag dhai guna
 Its shape is like a spherical pitch and is slightly thicker at the equator
 isi vajah se kuch khagolashastri iske aakaar ko akhrot jaisaa bataate hai
 It was only in the 17th century that Giovanni Cassini had correctly guessed that Aapitus has a blond and a black one
 aapitas ke gadhe rang vaale kshetra ko ab "kisini rajio" ke naam se bulaayaa jaataa he
 It is believed that the substances that give this area a thick color, they fell on this satellite through comets or any other external objects
 mana jaataa he ke in padaarthon main carbon ke kuch rasayan or hadrogen cynide maujuud hai
 Apart from the two colors, the middle rock of Aapitus is also a mystery
 yah 1,300 kimi lambi, ausatan 20 kimi chaudee or ausatan 13 kimi oonchi he
 Some parts of it rise 20 km above the surrounding plains
 yah chattan sirf gadhe rang vaale kisini rajio kshetra main milti he
 There are three ideas of how this rock formed, but none of them could explain why it is only in the thick colored part - saal 2001 se ab tak 13 maichon kii 7 siries hui hai
 Bangladesh has not won any series in that
 saal 1990 se ab tak 28 maichon kii 17 siries hui hai
 In that, Bangladesh has won 2 series and 0 ICC tournaments

 According to Siddhantbheda, four philosophies are famous in the Buddhist tradition
 inamen vaibhashik or sautrantik mat hinayan parampara main hai
 This is Southern Buddhism
 iskaa prachaar bhi lanka main he
 Yogachara and secondary schools are in the Mahayana tradition
 yah uttari baudhdhamat he
 These four philosophies emerged in the early words of Christ
 isi samay vaidic parampara main shaddarshanon kaa udai hua
 Thus, the emergence of philosophy cults in Indian tradition has taken place almost simultaneously and they have developed through mutual opposition
 pashchimi darshanon kii bhanti ye darshan purvapar kram main udit nahin hue hai
 Vasubandhu, Kumarlat Maitreya and Nagarjuna were the main teachers of these philosophies
 vaibhashik mat bahya vastuon kii satta tathaa swalakshanon ke rup main unka pratyaksh maanata he
 Hence it is called external positivism or "totalitarianism"
 saitrantik mat ke anusaar padaarthon kaa pratyaksh nahin, anumaan hota he
 Hence it is called externalism
 yogachaar mat ke anusaar bahya padaarthon kii satta nahin
 What we see is just science
 yogachaar mat vigyaanavaad kehalaata he
 According to secondary opinion, science is also not true
 sab kuch shunya he
 Zero means selfless, unformed, or indescribable
 shoonyavad kaa yah shunya vedant ke brahm ke bahut nikat aa jaataa he
 Buddhist philosophy was in the form of ethics in its early period just like Jain philosophy
 baad main buddha ke upadeshon ke aadhaar par vibhinn vidwaanon ne ise aadhyatmik rup dekar ek shashakt darshanikashaastra banaaya
 Four of the Aryasatyas, the first of the sermons given by the Buddha in Sarnath, are as follows: - 'dukkasamudayanadhomaragashtwar Aryabuddhayabhimatani Tattva'
 ’ arthath - Among these four elements, the Ashtanga Marg has special significance in the remedies of dawadashanidan and grief-prevention under the sorrow of these four elements
 iske atirikt panchasheel tathaa dwadash aaytan, jinase samyak karm karnaa chahie- bhi aachaar kii drushti se mahneey hai
 In fact, a comprehensive interpretation of the four Aryan truths is Buddhist philosophy
 buddha darshan kaa praarambhik shrenee vibhaag, satta ke mahatvapurn prashn ko lekar kiya gaya, jo ki chaar prasthaan ke rup main is prakaar janaa jaataa he- They consider the meaning to be enlightened ie perceptible
 ye bahyarth ko anumey maanate hai
 Although both accept the power of the outer world, the distinction of vision is absolute for one and mind is relative for the other, ie permissible power
 sautrantik mat main satta kii sthiti bahya se antermukhi he
 According to him, intelligence is with the shape, that is, in the intellect itself, externalities come
 chitt arthath aalayavigyaan main anant vigyaanon kaa udai hota rahata he
 By the power of a fleeting mind child, knowledge of all things happens
 vastutah ye bahya satta kaa sarvatha niraakaran karte hai
 Like the secondary opinion, there are two types of power considered in them - vyaavhaarik main punasch pariklpit or paratantra do rup grahya hai
 Here the mind has a tendency and retirement
 sabhi vastuain chitt kaa hi vikalp he
 This is known as hydrology
 yah aalayavigyaan kshanik vigyaanon kii santati maatr he
 Here both the external and internal entities are merged into zero, which is indescribable
 ye keval gyaan ko hi apane main sthit maanate hai or do prakaar kaa satya sweekaar karte hai- Out of these four sects of Buddhists, the first two are related to Hinayana and the last two are related to Mahayana
 hinayani sampradaay yathartwaadee tathaa sarvastivaadee he, jabaki mahayani sampradaayon main se yogaachari vichaar ko hi param tatva tathaa param rup main sweekaar karte hai
 Secondary philosophy is a prohibitive and critical method
 yahi kaaran he ki madhyamik shoonyavad ko 'sarvavainashikwaad' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 There are many other branches of Hinayana and Mahayana, which are not famous - baudhon ke anusaar vastu kaa nirantar parivartan hota rahata he or koi bhi padaarth ek kshan se adhik sthaayee nahin rahata he
 No human being can be the same in any two moments, therefore the soul is also transitory and this principle is called transientism

 Similarly, earthly matter is transitory, but there is a feeling of unity in them
 is prakaar yah siddhanth ‘nitywad’ or ‘abhaavvaad’ ke bich kaa madhyam maarg he
 'pratyatasamutpad' refers to the origin of a work based on the origin of another object or a cause on receipt of one thing
 prathithyasamutpaada saapeksh bhi he or nirpeksh bhi
 In relative terms it is the world and in absolute terms it is nirvana
 yah kshanikwaad kii bhanti shashwatvaad or uchchhedwad ke madhya kaa maarg he; isiilie ise madhyammarg kaha jaataa he or isko maanane vaale madhyamik

 hindu shastron kii drushti se "ahimsa" kaa arth he sarvada tathaa sarvada zeeshan sab praaniyon ke saath droh kaa abhaav

 yadi unke dwaara kisi prakaar kii hinsavriti kaa udai hota he to ve sadhana kii siddhi main upadey tathaa upkaar nahin maane jate
 The glory and superiority of "truth" has been propounded everywhere, but if the struggle of truth with non-violence occurs, then the truth is considered to be truth rather than truth
 koi vastu jaisi dekhi gai ho tathaa jaisi anumit ho uskaa usee rup main vachan ke dwaara prakat karnaa tathaa man ke dwaara sankalp karnaa "satya" kehalaata he, parantu yah vaani bhi sab bhuton ke upkaar ke liye pravrutt hoti he, bhuton ke upaghaat ke liye nahin
 Thus, the test of truth is non-violence

 jain dharm main sab jeevon ke prati sanyampurna vyavhaar ahimsa he
 Ahimsa literally means not to commit violence
 iske paribhaashik arth vidhyatmak or nishedhaatmak donon hai
 Not to have a sentimental tendency, not to kill, or to resist mere tendency is prohibitive nonviolence; Self-righteousness, self-righteousness, self-education, spiritual service, preaching, knowledge discussion, etc
 are methodical non-violence
 sanyamee ke dwaara bhi ashakya koti kaa pranavadh ho jaataa he, vah bhi nishedhaatmak ahimsa hinsa nahin he
 Prohibitive nonviolence consists only of violence, methodological nonviolence has active activation
 yah sthool drushti kaa nirnay he
 Upon reaching deep, the facts are something else
 nishedh main pravriti or pravriti main nishedh hota hi he
 Prohibition of non-violence in prohibitive non-violence and violence in non-violent non-violence
 hinsa na karanevaala yadi aantarik pravritiyon ko shuddh na kare to vah ahimsa na hogi

 Without this, there can be no tendency or non-violence, it is a matter of certainty
 vyavhaar main nishedhaatmak ahimsa ko niskriy ahimsa or vidhyatmak ahimsa ko sakriy ahimsa kaha jaataa he
 In the Jain text Acharangasutra, the time of which is probably the third to the fourth century BC
 Is, the preaching of non-violence is given this way: This is what the past, future and present means say - do not kill any living creature, any animal, any thing that has a soul, nor behave inappropriately, neither Do not insult, do not suffer or persecute
 prithvi, jal, agni, vaayu or vanaspati, ye sab alag jeev hai
 There are different creatures holding different personalities in each and every earth
 uparyukt sthavar jeevon ke uparaant nnas praani hai, jinamein chalane phirane kaa samarthy hota he

 sankshep main ragadwesh kaa apradurbhaav ahimsa or unka pradurbhaav hinsa he
 There is no national violence even if the death of uncultured category is achieved by the rage-less tendency, it is there, even if there is no calamity
 jo ragadwesh kii pravriti karata he vah apni aatma kaa hi ghaat karata he, phir chaahe duusare jeevon kaa ghaat kare yaa na kare
 Violence is also not to be avoided and violence is also to be turned into violence
 isliye jahaan ragadwesh kii pravriti he vahaan nirantar pranavadh hota he
 Violence only leads to bondage with sin
 is drushti se hinsa kaa koi prakaar nahin hota
 But the reasons for violence are many, so its types also become many in terms of reason

 is mohavilay ke taratamya par uske do rup nishchit kiye gaye hai : ahimsa mahavrath, ahimsa anuvrat
 There is a difference in quantity, not formatism
 muni kii ahimsa purna he, is dasha main shravak kii ahimsa apurna
 Like a sage, a listener cannot remain free from all forms of violence
 muni kii apeksha shravak kii ahimsa kaa pariman bahut kam he
 For example, the non-violence of the sage is 20 Biswa, and the non-violence of a disciple is one and a half Biswa
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki shravak 19 jeevon kii hinsa ko chhod saktaa he, vaadar sthavar jeevon kii hinsa ko nahin
 This reduces the magnitude of his non-violence - ten Biswa
 isamen bhi shravak unniis jeevon kii hinsa kaa sankalpapurvak tyaag karata he, aarambhja hinsa kaa nahin
 Therefore, its quantity remains half that, ie five biswas
 sankalpapurvak hinsa bhi unheen unniis jeevon kii tyaagi jaati he jo nirparaadh hai
 Sapradha nnas cannot free a listener from the violence of creatures
 isse vah ahimsa dhai biswa rah jaati he
 The innocent also abandons the audacious violence of nineteen creatures
 saapeksh hinsa to usase ho jaati he
 In this way, the magnitude of the anvisa of the listener remains one and a half biswa
 is pracheen gaatha main ise sankshep main is prakaar kaha he : Jeeva Suhumathula, Sankappa, Arambhabhave Duviha
 savaraah niravarahaa, savikkha chaiv niravikkha
 
 sookshm jeevahinsa, sthool jeevahinsa, sankalp hinsa, aarambh hinsa, sapraadh hinsa, nirparaadh hinsa, saapeksh hinsa, nirpeksh hinsa
 There are eight types of violence
 shravak inamen se chaar prakaar kii, hinsa kaa tyaag karata he
 Hence the non-violence of the listener is incomplete
 isi prakaar buddha or isai dharmon main bhi ahimsa kii badi mahima he
 Jain and Buddhist religions culminated the tradition that was started by the Upanishadic mystics against the Vedic violent sacrifices
 jain ahimsa saidhantik drushti se saare dharmon kii apeksha asaadhaaran thi

 usee kaa yah parinaam tha ki rakt or lut ke naam par daud padanevaali madhya asia kii vikaraal jatiyaan prem or dayaa kii murti ban gayi
 Christians were also particularly attracted to non-violence due to the influence of Buddhism; The self-sacrifice of Jesus was an example of love and non-violence
 unhone apane hatyaron tak kii sadgati ke liye bhagwaan se prarthana kii or apane anuyaayiyon se spasht kaha he ki yadi koi gaal par prahaar kare to duusare ko bhi prahaar sweekaar karne ke liye aage kar do

 ye panchatattvon- agin, vaayu, aadi tathaa megh, vidyut, surya aadi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In all the Vedas and Brahmana texts, the name of the Rigveda or its Samhita is first counted
 phir anek vishyon kii vyapak charchaa karne ke kaaran is samhita kaa varnyavishayparak mahatva bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The Samhita of the Rigveda is a collection of the Ritchas
 riksanhita kaa vibhaajan do prakaar se kiya jaataa he- ashtak-kram or mandal-kram
 The entire Samhita is divided into eight octaves under the octave and each octave has eight chapters
 adhyay virgon main vibhajit hai or varg ke antargat richaayen hai
 The total number of chapters is 64 and the number of sections is 2006
 mandal-kram main sampoorn samhita main das mandal hai
 There are many verses in each circle, many verses in each verse, and many mantras in each verse
 tadnusaar rugveda-samhita main 10 mandal, 85 anuwak, 1028 sookt or 10552 mantra he
 In this way a beautiful and certain system of division of the mantra-samhita of the Rigveda is obtained
 rugveda-samhita ke mantradrashtaa rishiyon par yadi dhyaan diya jaae, to ham pate hai ki duusare se saatven mandal ke antargat samavisht mantra kisi ek rishi ke dwaara hi saakshaatkaar kiye gayi he
 That is why these divisions are called lineages
 in mandalon ko duusare mandalon kii tulana main pracheen mana jaataa he
 Although many scholars disagree with this view
 aathven mandal main kanv, bhrigu aadi kuch pariwaron ke mantra sankalit hai
 In the first and tenth circles, the sukta-numbers are the same
 donon main 191 sookt hi hai
 The notable feature of both these circles is that it has compiled mantras interviewed by many sages
 pehle or dasven mandal main vibhinn vishyon ke sookt hai
 Often scholars consider both these circles to be relatively ancient
 navaan mandal bhi kuch vishesh mahatva liye hue he
 In it all the mantras of Soma Devta have been compiled
 isiilie iskaa doosraa prachlit naam he- pavamaan mandal
 For the sake of convenience, the details of the mandalas, suktakas and sages of the Rigveda Code are given in the following table
 in mantron ke drashtaa-rishiyon main gritsamad, vishwamitra, vamdev, atri, bharadwaj, vasishtha, bhrigu or angira pramukh hai
 Many Vedic women have also been the watchers of mantras
 pramukh rishikaaon ke rup main vaak ambhrini, surya, savitri, sarparaji, yami, vaivaswathi, urvashi, lopamudra, ghosha aadi ke naam ullekhneey he
 a total of 20 verses are used in the Rigveda Samhita
 inamen bhi pramukh chand saat hai
 These are inamen bhi in chaar chhandon ke mantron kii sankhya is samhita main sabase adhik paari jaati he- trishtup, gayatri, jagati or anushtup
 The Rig Veda details the social, political, economic system and institutions of the then society
 isamen unke darshanik, aadhyatmik kalatmak tathaa vaigyanik vichaaron kaa samavesh bhi he
 Gods and gods and goddesses had an important place in the life of Vedic sages
 rugveda kaa prayek mantra kisi na kisi devtaa se sambaddh he
 In reality, deity means subject matter
 tabhi chura or ookhal jaisi vasteen bhi devtaa he
 Axis and agriculture are also deities
 rugveda kii samhita main devstuti kii pradhanta he
 Eulogy, Indra, Marut, Usha, Som, Ashivanou, etc
 are offered hymns in many hymns of various gods
 sabase adhik sookt indra devtaa kii stuti main kahe gayi hai or uske baad sankhya kii drushti se agni ke sookhton kaa sthaan he
 Therefore Indra and Agin appear to be the presiding deities of the Vedic Aryans
 kuch sookhton main mithravaruna, indravayu, dhavapruthivi jaise yugal devataaon kii stutiyaan hai
 Many deities like Aditya, Marut, Rudra, Vishwadeva etc
 are also praiseworthy in mantras
 deviyon main ushaa or aditi kaa sthaan agraganya he
 Apart from devotions in Rikasamhita, there are also other topics on the topic, such as 'aksushakaat' depicting the plight of the gambler, 'jnanasukta', which proclaims the importance of speech and knowledge, 'yamaayami-', presenting the dialogue of Yama and Yami
 Dialogues', 'pururava urvashi-dialogues', etc
, highlighting the conversation between Pururava and Urvashi
 vishay kii gambheertha ko darshane vaale sookhton main darshanik sookhton ko gina ja saktaa he, jaise purushasukt, hiranyagarbhasukt, nasadysookt aadi
 In this, there is an esoteric philosophical discussion about creation and origin
