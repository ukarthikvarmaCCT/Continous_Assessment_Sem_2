 The Sise-chamber method was modernized by the development of the gay-lupac Pillar in 1827 AD and the Globar Pillar in 1859 AD
 yahan nitrogen ke oxide, gandhak dwizarkik tathaa vaayu ko kaksh main pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 Such a gas mixture is injected into the 25-foot-high Glover column from below
 is stambh main upar se ge-lusac stambh kaa gandhakaml tathaa nitrosil gandhakaml kaa mishran tapakataa he
 The gas mixture enters the sis chamber after exiting the column
 saadharantaya sis kaksh teen rahete hai
 Here steam also enters the chamber
 gas mishran or bhaap ke bich kriya hokar, gandhakaml banakar, kaksh ke pende main ikattha hota he
 The residual gases now enter the gay-lussac column
 inamen pradhanthya nitrogen ke oxide rahete hai
 The gay-lussac column is filled with pieces of coke or stone
 usamen upar se gandhakaml tapakataa he or rukaawat ke kaaran dhire-dhire girakar, nitrogen ke oxidon ko avashoshit kar, nitrosil gandhakaml banataa he or glover stambh main prayukt hota he
 In this way, the loss of nitrogen oxides is saved

 Another method of manufacturing sulfur acid is the contact method
 is vidhi se praapt amla adhik shuddh or sandra hota he
 It was developed by a scientist named Nitz in 1889–90 AD
 germany kii badishche anilin and soda fabric company ne is vidhi se sarvapratham amla taiyaar kiya, at: ise badishche vidhi, athwa badishche prakram bhi kehete hai
 Most of the world's sulfuricides are manufactured nowadays by contact method
 isse kisi bhi sandran kaa amla praapt ho saktaa he
 In this method, sulfur is obtained by burning sulfur, or by acquiring pyrites
 ise vaayu ke saath milakar utprerak par le laayaa jaataa he, jahaan gandhak dwizarkik vaayu ke oxigen se sanyukt hokar gandhak trioxide banataa he
 "oleum" is obtained by absorbing sulfur trioxide into the concentrated sulfur
 olium kii jal ke saath kriya se vaanchit sandratha ke amla ko praapt kiya jaataa he
 First microdivided platinum was used as a catalyst
 yah bahut mahanga padataa tha
 When vanadium pentoxide is used in place of platinum, it is much cheaper than platinum
 utprerak kii kriyasheeltaa kam na ho jaae, iske liye aavashyak he ki sulfur dioxide arsenic, raakh tathaa dhul kanon se bilkul mukt ho
 Hence, the sulfur is arranged for filtering the bifurcation and it is passed through such substances in which arsenic is completely released
 yadi gas ko shuddh na kar liya jaae, to utprerak kii kaaryashiltaa jald nasht ho sakati he
 The gases that enter the catalytic chamber contain sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen
 urdhwadhar paatro main utprerak rakhaa rahata he
 The gas released there is absorbed into the concentrated sulfuric acid
 isse olium praapt hota he
 Up to 40 percent more sulfur in the oleum can be absorbed in addition to 100 per cent of sulfur
 aavashyak maatra main pani daalkar, isse vaanchit sandratha kaa amla praapt kar sakate hai
 Several acid manufacturing plants have been made by contact method, which can give more pure and less expensive acid

 Ghatotkacha was the son of Bhima and Hidimba and was very powerful
 vah mahabharat ke pramukh paatro main se ek tha
 After the burning of Laksha Griha, Pandavas along with their mother went inside Kamyak forest after leaving Laksha Griha via the tunnel
 kai kos chalane ke kaaran bhimsen ko chhod kar shesh log thakaan se behaal ho gayi or ek vat vriksh ke neeche let gayi
 Mother Kunti was distraught with thirst, so Bhimsen went in search of a reservoir or lake
 ek jalashay drushtigat hone par unhone pehle swayan jal piya or mata tathaa bhaaiyon ko jal pilaane ke liye laut kar unke paas aaye
 They were all immersed in deep sleep due to fatigue, so Bhima started guarding them there

 "after saying this, Bhimsen started fighting with him, beating the rhythm
 kunti tathaa anya pandav kii bhi neend khul gai
 Seeing Bhima fighting with a demon there and seeing a beautiful girl standing, Kunti asked, "daughter! Who are you?" Hidimba shared everything with them
 arjuna ne hidimb ko maarane ke liye apana dhanush uthaa liya kintu bhim ne unhen baan chhodane se manaa karte huye kaha, "anuj! tum baan mat chodo, yah meraa shikaar he or mere hi haathon maregaa
 "having said this, Bhima grabbed Hidimb with both hands and swung it several times in the air and hit the ground with such intensity that his life and body flew away
 hidimb ke baad bhim kamyak van kaa raja bana tathaa bhim ne 20 sam kamyak van par raaj kiya
 When Hidimba died, they began preparing for departure from there, upon which Hidimba fell at Kunti's feet and prayed, "O mother! i have accepted your son Bhima as her husband
 aap log mujhe krupa karke sweekaar kar lijiye
 If you do not accept me, then i will give up my life at this moment
 " hidimba ke hriday main bhim ke prati prabal prem kii bhaavana dekh kar yudhisthir bole, "hidimbe! main tumhen apane bhai ko saunpta hoon kintu yah keval din main tumhaare saath rahaa karegaa or raatri ko ham logon ke saath rahaa karegaa
 "hidimba agreed to this and started living happily with Bhimsen
 ek varsh vyateet hone par hidimba kaa putr utpann hua
 She was named Ghatotkacha because of her lack of hair on her head
 vah atyant mayavi niklaa or janm lete hi bada ho gaya
 Hidimba took his son to the Pandavas and said, "this is your brother's son, so he will be in service of you
" " itnaa kah kar hidimba vahaan se chali gai
 Ghatotkacha bowed with reverence at the feet of the Pandavas and Mother Kunti and said, "now tell me my worthy service
 ? uski baat sun kar kunti boli, "tu mere vansh kaa sabase bada pautra he
 Your service will definitely be taken when the time comes
 " is par ghatotkach ne kaha, "aap log jab bhi mujhe samaran karenge, main aap logon kii seva main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, Ghatotkacha went towards the present Uttarakhand

 saath hi ve bharat ke pehle vaigyanik shodhakartta the
 He was the first scientist from India to receive an American patent
 unhen radio vigyaan kaa pita mana jaataa he
 He also wrote science stories and is considered the father of Bengali science fiction
 british bharat ke bengal praant main janme basu ne saint zavier mahavidhyalay, kalakatta se snaatak kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 He then went to London for medical education, but due to health problems he had to leave this education in the middle and return to India
 inhone phir presidency mahavidhyalay main bhautikee ke praadhyaapak kaa pad sambhala or jatigat bhedbhaav kaa saamana karte hue bhi bahut se mahatvapurn vaigyanik prayog kiye
 He made extraordinary progress in sending wireless signals and first started using semiconductors to capture radio messages
 lekin apni khojon se vyavsaayik laabh uthaane kii jagah inhone inhen saarvajanik rup se prakashit kar diya taaki anya shodhakartta inpar aage kaam kar saken
 After this, he made many discoveries in botany
 inhone ek yantra crescograph kaa avishkaar kiya or isse vibhinn uttejkon ke prati paudhon kii pratikriya kaa adhyayan kiya
 In this way, they proved that there is a lot of similarity between flora and animal tissues
 ye patent prakriya ke bahut viruddh the or mitron ke kehane par hi inhone ek patent ke liye aavedan kiya
 In recent years, their contributions to modern science are again being recognized
 basu kaa janm 30 navambar 1858 ko bengal main dhaka jile ke faridpur ke memansingh main hua tha
 His father Lord Chandra Basu was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj and was a sub-magistrate or Assistant Commissioner in Faridpur, Bardhaman and elsewhere
 inkaa parivaar raarikhal gaanv, bikrampur se aayaa tha, jo aajkal bangladesh ke munshiganj jile main he
 By the age of eleven, he was educated in a school in the village
 basu kii shiksha ek bangla vidhyalay main prarambh hui
 His father believed that his mother tongue should be well versed before learning English
 vikrampur main 1915 main ek sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue basu ne kaha- "us samay par bacchon ko angreji vidyalayon main bhejnaa haisiyat kii nishaani mana jaataa tha
 In the Bengali school i was sent to, i used to sit on my right side, the son of my father's Muslim attendant and on my left the son of a fisherman
 ye hi mere khel ke saathi bhi the
 i listened to their stories of birds, animals and aquatic animals
 shaayad inhen kahaniyon ne mere mastishk main prakruti kii sanrachana par anusandhan karne kii gahari ruchi jagaai
 "after schooling, he moved to Calcutta and joined St
 Xavier's School
 jagadish chandra bose kii jeev vigyaan main bahut ruchi thi or 22 varsh kii aayu main chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai karne ke liye landan chale gaye
 But due to poor health, he gave up the idea of becoming a doctor and went to Christ's College, Cambridge, and there, a famous professor of physics, Father Lafont, inspired Bose to study physics
 varsh 1885 main ye swadesh laute tathaa bhautikee ke sahaayak praadhyaapak ke rup main presidency college main padhaane lage
 Here he stayed until 1915
 us samay bhartiya shikshakon ko angrej shikshakon kii tulana main ek tihaai vetan diya jaataa tha
 This was opposed by Jagdish Chandra Bose and continued to work for three years without pay, due to which his condition deteriorated and he was severely indebted
 is karj ko chukaane ke liye unhen apni pushtaini jameen bhi bechni padi
 Jagdish Chandra Bose won the fourth year and was given full salary
 bose ek achche shikshak bhi the, jo kaksha main padhaane ke liye bade paimaane par vaigyanik pradarshnon kaa upyog karte the
 Some students of Bose like Satendra Nath Bose later became famous physicists
 british saidhantik bhautik vigyaani james clerk maxwell ne ganitiya rup se vividh tarang dairdhya kii vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi, par unki bhavishyavaanee ke satyaapan se pehle 1879 main nidhan unka ho gaya
 British physicist Oliver Lodge demonstrated the existence of Maxwell waves by transmitting them with stars in 1887–88
 german bhautikashastri henrik hertz ne 1888 main mukt antariksh main vidyut chumbakeey tarangon ke astitv ko prayog karke dikhaaya
 Subsequently, Lodge continued Hertz's work and gave a memorable lecture in June 1894 and published it in book form
 loj ke kaam ne bharat ke bose sahit vibhinn deshon ke vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya
 The first notable aspect of Bose's microwave research was that he brought the wavelength to the millimeter level
 ve prakaash ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye lambii tarang dairdhya kii prakaash tarangon ke nuksaan ko samaj gaye
 In 1893, Nikola Tesla performed the first public radio communications
 ek saal baad, kolkata main navambar 1894 ke ek saarvajanik pradarshan dauraan, bose ne ek millimetre range microwave tarang kaa upyog barood duuri par prajvalit karne or ghanti bajaane main kiya
 Lieutenant Governor Sir William mckenzie witnessed Bose's performance at the Calcutta Town Hall
 bose ne ek bengali niabandh, 'adrishy alok' main likhaa tha, "adrishy prakaash aasaani se eent kii deevaaron, bhawanon aadi ke bheetar se ja sakati he, isliye taar kii bina prakaash ke madhyam se sandesh sanchaarit ho saktaa he
 "popov did one such experiment in Russia
 bose k "dabl apvartak crystal dwaara bijli kii kirnon ke dhruvikaran par" pehla vaigyanik lekh, loj lekh ke ek saal ke bheetar, may 1895 main bengal kii aciatic socity ko bheja gaya tha
 His second article was sent to Lord Royal in London in October 1895 by Lord Rayleigh
 disambar 1895 main, landan patrika electrician ne bose kaa lekh "ek nae electro-polariscope par" prakashit kiya
 At that time the term 'coherer' coined by Lodge in the English-speaking world was used for Hertz's wave receiver or detector
 electrician ne tatkaal bose ke 'kohirar' par tippanee kii
 
 The commentary quoted from the English magazine Electrician is: bose "apane kohirar" ko behtar karne kii yojana banaai lekin yah patent ke bare main kabhi nahin sochaa
 Bose conducted his experiments at a time when radio was developing as a contact medium
 radio microwave optics par bose ne jo kaam kiya tha wo radio communication se judaa hua nahin tha, lekin unke dwaara kiye hue sudhaar evam unke dwaara is vishay main likhe hue tathyon ne duusare radio avishkaarakon ko zarur prabhavit kiya tha
 In the late 1894 era, Guglielmo Marconi was working on a radio system that was being designed specifically for wireless telegraphy
 1896 ke aarambh tak yah pranali physics dwaara bataaye gaye range se zyaada duri main radio signlles transmit kar rahi thi
 Jagadish Chandra Bose was the first scientist to find out what the semiconductor junction was used to detect radio waves and discovered many microwave components in this method
 iske baad agle 50 saal tak millimetre lambaai kii electromagnetic tarango par koi shodh kaary nahin hua tha
 In 1897, Bose described his research on millimeter waves at the Royal Institution in London
 unhone apane shodh main vevagids, horn antena, daai -electric lens ,alag alag posraiser or semiconductor jinaki frequency 60 ghz tak thi -- unka istemaal kiya tha
 All these devices are still present at Bose Institute, Kolkata
 ek 1
3 mm multibeam resiver jo kii erizona ke NRAO 12 meter telescope main hai, acharya bose 1897 main likhe hue research paper ke siddhanto par banaaya gaya hai
 Sir Neville Mott received the Nobel Prize in 1977 for his research work in Solid State Electronics
 unhone yah kaha tha kii acharya jagadish chandra bose apane samay se 60 saal aage the
 In fact, it was Bose who predicted the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors
 biophysics ke kshetra main unka sabase bada yogadan yah tha kii unhone apan dikhaaya kii paudho main uttejnaa kaa sanchaar vaidyuthik madhyam se hota hai naa kii chemical madhyam se
 These claims were later proven to be true through scientific proyogo
 acharya bose ne sabase pehle microwave ke vanaspati ke tishyu par hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 He studied the effect of changing weather on plants
 iske saath saath unhone rasinic inhibitors kaa paudhon par asar or badalte hue taapmaana se hone vaale paudhon par asar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 By analyzing changes in cell membrane potential under different conditions, they came to the conclusion that plants are sensitive "they can feel pain, feel affection, etc
"
 bose ne alag alag dhaatu or paudhon ke tishyu par fatig rispance kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya tha
 He stimulated different metals by mixing electrical, mechanical, chemical and thermal methods and noted the similarities of the cell and metal reaction
 bose ke prayogo ne simulated koshikao or dhaatu main chakree fatig pratikriya dikhaai thi
 Along with this, special cyclic fatigues and recovery responses were also studied for different stimuli in living cells and metals
 acharya bose ne badalte hue electrical stimuli ke saath paudhon badalte hue electrical pratikriya kaa ek graph banaaya, or yah bhi dikhaaya kii jab paudhon ko zehar yaa anaesthetic di jaati hai tab unki pratikriya kaam hone lagati hai or aage chalakar shunaya ho jaati hai
 But the zinc metal did not show this reaction when it was treated with oxalic acid
 1917 main jagadish chandra bose ko "nite" kii oopaadhi pradaan kii gai tathaa sheeghra hi bhautik tathaa jeev vigyaan ke liye royal sosayadi landan ke faillo chun liye gaye
 Bose had done all his research without any good equipment and laboratory, so Jagdish Chandra Bose was thinking of making a good laboratory
 "bose institute" isi soch kaa parinaam he joki vigyaan main shodhakarya ke liye raashtra kaa ek prasiddh kendra he

 Where there is a ritual of Dwarachar before the main rites at the traditional wedding ceremonies at the family level, if it is possible to make the atmosphere of the halls appropriate for the rites, then the cases of reception and clothing and flowers can be completed at that time also
 Sit on the pedestal and greet the bride
 phir kanya ko bulaakar paraspar vastra or pushpopahar sampann karaaye jaaen
 Traditional greetings, etc
 can also be given on the same occasion

 The seventh phase of this rite is Laja Home or Bhawren, or Phere
 praayshchit aahuti ke baad lajahome or yagyagni kii parikrama kamila-jula kram chalata he
 For Lajahome, the girl's brother stands behind with a ball in a plate
 ek mutti khil apni bahin ko de
 The girl hands him over to the groom
 var use aahuti mantra ke saath havan kar de
 Thus, it should be done three times
 kanya teenon baar bhai ke dwaara diye hue khil kaapane pati ko de, vah teenon baar havan main aparn kar de
 In Lajahome, the sister gets a meal from her brother's house, she hands it over to her husband
 kahati he beshak mere vyaktigat upyog ke liepita ke ghar se mujhe kuch mila he, par use main chhipaakar alag se nahin rakhti,aapako saunpti hoon
 No one should feel alienation or a sense of concealment, so the way the husband earns something, he hands it over to the wife, in the same way the wife also hands over her achievements to the husband
 pati sochataa he, ham log haath-pair se jo kamaayenge, usee se apana kaam chalaayenge,kisi ke udaartaapurvak diye hue anudaan ko bina shram kiye khaakar kyon hamkisi ke rini bane
 Therefore the husband does not keep that laja for his dinner, but gives home in the yajna
 jan kalyaan ke liye us padaarth ko vayubhoot banakarsansar ke vayumandal main bikher detaa he
 In this action, the great human ideal is embedded here that the goods of free will either not be accepted or if it is found then it should be spent in the public interest
 log apni-apni nij kii paseene kii kamai par hi guzar-basar karen
 The deceased had the same idealism after the banquet that the boys did not take the money received in succession by the father in his work, but spent it in the maintenance of social service Brahmins or in other virtues
 yahi dahej kesambandh main bhi thik he
 The father's home was generously received, so his feelings are heartbreaking, but you too must have some feelings
 muft kaa maal khate hue kisi kamau manushya kaa gairat aana swaabhaavik he
 It is right for him to think that the money without hard work, given even by the generous spirit of charity, will not digest it, so it is appropriate to sacrifice the gift in the work of Jan Mangal, Paramarthyagya
 isi uddeshyse patni ke bhai ke dwaara diye gayi laja ko vah yajna kaary main laga detaahai
 This is the right use of dowry, it is also a practice that a lot of charity is done on behalf of the bride on the occasion of marriage
 acha ho jo kuch mili, vah sabko hidaan kar de
 Not only at the time of marriage, but also on other occasions, if anyone ever gets the same hard work gift from someone, then there should be a policy regarding that we will not become indebted to the hereafter by eating free goods, but by applying such grant in charity, that generous tradition Do not stop in yourself and will further increase public welfare
 kahan bhartiya samskruti kii udaar bhaavana or kahan aaj ke dhan lolupon dvarakanya paksh kii aanten noch daalane vaali dahej kii pashachik maangen, donon menjameen-aasmaan kaa antar he
 One who should be grateful to his heart, soul piece to the bride and groom of the bride's side towards him and think how to express his reverence and goodwill in return for this supernatural gift
 yah na hokar ulte jab kanya paksh ko dabaa hua samaj kar use tarah-tarah sesatane or chusane kii yojana banaai jaati he, to yahi samajhnaa chahie ki bhartiyaparamparaayen bilkul ulti ho gayin
 Unrighteousness in place of religion, the kingdom of insecurity prevailed in the place of divinity
 lajahome vatarmaan kaal kii kshudra manyataon ko dhikkaarta he or dahej kesambandh main sahi drushtikon apnaane kii prerana detaa he
 Orbiting the husband and wife of Agni

 In the first four ceremonies, the girl was ahead and the groom was behind
 chaar parikrama ho jane par ladakaaage ho jaae or ladki peeche
 Parikrama mantra should be uttered at the time of circumambulation, and after completion of the parikrama, each person should worship with the bride-groom Gayatri Mantra, this means - the family will lead the girl in family functions, her counseling will be valued, and she will follow, Because the woman has more experience of those works
 baahar ke kaaryon main varanetritv karata he or nari uskaa anusaran karti he, kyonki vyavsayikkshetron main var kaa anubhav adhik hota he
 In which, the direction of which is less, in another, be careful to increase its information and make it equitable
 bhaavana kshetra main nari aage he, karmkshetra main purush
 Both sides are important in their respective positions
 kul milakar nari kaa vacharsv, pad, gaurav evam vajan bada baithta he
 Therefore, he is given the opportunity to do four rounds and the male has three rounds
 gaurav ke chunaav ke 4 vot kanya ko or 3 vot var ko milte hai
 Therefore, the male has always got the first place
 seetaram, radheshyaam, lakshminarayan,umamahesh aadi yugmon main pehle nari kaa naam he, peeche nar kaa
 The mixed order of Laja Home and Parikrama goes on
 shilarohan ke baad var-vadhookhde-khadey gayatri mantra se ek aahuti samarpit karen
 Now do the ritual with mantra
 vadhoo aage, var peeche chalem
 Upon completion of a circumambulation, make a sacrifice of Paralajahome
 aahuti karke duusari parikrama pehle kii tarah mantrabolate hue karen
 Similarly, do Lajahom's second sacrifice and do the third round and the third round should do the fourth round
 iske baad gayatri mantra kiahuti dete hue teen parikramaayen var ko aage karke parikrama mantra bolte huekarai jaaen
 Realize with a sacrifice that the sacrificial energy is being intensified in the sacrificial energy and conscience outside

 The English language is written in Roman script

 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the Norman Conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, for which Norman vocabulary and spelling rules were heavily used
 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language
 angreji bhashaa kaa kaam chalau gyaan anek kshetron, jaise kii chikitsa or computer, ke liye ek aavashyaktaa ban chukaa he; parinamswaroop ek arab se zyada log kam se kam buniyadi str kii angreji bol lete hai

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands
 in jarmenic janajatiyon main se ek thi engles, jo sambhawatah angton se aaye the
 Bead has written that his entire country, except his old land, had come to Britain

 Anglo Saxons began invading Denmark and Jutland in 449 AD, before their arrival the locals of England spoke Brythonic, a Celtic language
 haalaanki boli main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn parivartan 1066 ke norman akraman ke pashchaat hi aaye, parantu bhashaa ne apane naam ko banaaye rakhaa or norman akraman purv kii boli ko ab puraani angreji kaha jaataa he
 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain
 inamen se ek boli, let west sexn, antat apana varchasv sthapit karne main safal hui
 mul puraani angrezi bhashaa phir akraman kii do laharon se prabhavit hui
 pehla jarmenic parivaar ke uttari jarmenic shakha ke bhashaa bolne waalon dwaara tha; unhone 8 veen or 9 veen sadi main british dwipon ke kuch hisson ko jitkar upnivesh bana diya
 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world
 paanchavin or chhathi sadi main britain ke dwipon par uttar kii ore se angel or sexn qabeelon ne hamalaa kiya tha or unhone keltic bhashaayen bolne vaale sthaneey logon ko scotland, ireland or wales kii ore dhakel diya tha
 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date

 In 1066, the Duke of Normandy invaded England and conquered the anglo-saxon tribes here

 This period of English continued from 1100 to 1500 and this period of English expansion is called medieval English

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 paaramparik prakaaron ke uccharan, vyakaran or shabd bhandar angreji kii anya kismon se bhinn, kabhi kabhaar baari maatra main, hai
 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker

 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups

 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface

 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main

 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English

 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English

 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Some of the best temples in Central India are said to have been built by a fictional prince, Janakacharya, who had to spend twenty years in the act of atoning bravery

 Call it the decency of unknown makers, or the historical Tamisra, but without doubt the temple architecture, which is unique examples of Lingaraj, Mukteshwar, Brahmeshwar, Rameshwar, Parameshwara, Uttreshwar, Ishwareshwar, Bharateshwar, Lakshmaneshwar etc

 The impact of the Muslim invasion on architecture did not affect India anywhere else, because the civilization with which the Muslim civilization collided, no one was as opposed to it as the Indian civilization
 chir pratishthit bhartiya saamaajik or dharmik pravritiyon kii tulana main muslim sabhyataa bilkul nai to thi hi, uske moulik siddhaat bhi bhinn the
 The struggle of the two was the struggle of realism with idealism, the dream of reality and the latent of the expressed, the proof of which is evident in the distinction between mosque and temple

 The walls of the Majid are often engraved with plain or sacred rectangles, depicting human figures in them is prohibited; While sculpture and anthropomorphism in the walls of the temples reached the highest peak, Likhai was not named
 pattharon ke sahal rangon main hi is chithran dwaara mandiron kii sajivta ai; jabaki masjidon main rangabirange pattharon, sangmarmar or chitra vicitra plasters ke dwaara deevaaren mukhar kii gai
 Proven to build heavy structures of the same kind on the principle of gravitation, Indian artisans have been on the same rut since ages, outlaw talent, new theories, new methods and new directions brought by the winners from other countries and thrived

 The era of architecture also changed in the country from north to south as Muslim dominance grew
 muslim vaastu ke teen kramik charan spasht hai
 The first phase, which lasted for a very short period, was of the "elimination" inspired by Vijayadarp and bigotry, about which Hasan Nizami writes that after winning each fort the custom of tramping it under the feet of giant elephants to its pillar and foundation
 Was

 The second phase was followed by a purpose and partial demolition, in which buildings were demolished so that finished goods could be available for the mosques and mausoleums of the conquerors
 badi-badi dharane or stambh apane sthaan se hataakar nai jagah le jane ke liye bhi haathiyon kaa hi prayog hua
 It was during this period that special damage was done to the temples, which became the mine of finished goods for the construction of new capitals of the conquered provinces, and Hindu architecture from North India was often destroyed

 In terms of styles, there can be three classes of Muslim architecture
 pehali dilli style, athwa shahanshahi style he, jise praaia: "pathan vaastu" kehete hai 
 This class includes Qutub Minar of Delhi, Sultan Garhi, Altamash's Tomb, Alai Darwaza, Nizamuddin, gayasuddin Tughlaq and Ferozeshah Tughlaq's Tomb, Kotla Ferozeshah, Mubarakshah's Tomb, Sher Shah's Mosque, Sher Shah's Mosque Sahasram's Tomb and Ajmer's Embroidery
 The day's huts are notable

 These include the Punjab style; Such as the mausoleums of Shraqne Alam and Shahayusuf Gardiji, Tabriji, Bahá'u'lláhc of Multan; Bengal style: such as Adina Mosque of Pandua, Fatekhan's Tomb of Gaur, Kadam Rasool, Tantimara Mosque; Gujarat style: such as the Jama Masjids of Khamba, Ahmedabad, Bharoch and Chamane, Nagina Masjid Tomb; Jaunpur style: such as Atala Mosque, Lal Darwaza Mosque, Jama Masjid; Malwa style: like Madhu's Jahan Mahal, Hoshang's Tomb, Jama Masjid, Hindola Mahal, Dhar's Lat Masjid, Chanderi's Badal Mahal Gate, Kushak Mahal, Shehzadi's Rauja; Southern style: like Jama Masjid and Haft Gumbaz of Gulberg, Madarsa of Bidar, Charminar of Hyderabad, etc 
; Bijapur Khandesh style, such as Golgumbaj of Bijapur, Rauja Ibrahim and Jama Masjid, Tomb of Farooqi dynasty of Thalner Khandesh; And Kashmir style: such as the Jama Masjid in Srinagar, the tomb of Shah Hamdan, etc

 Outstanding specimens of Indian art are also found outside India in Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, Syam, Java, Bali, Hindchina and Cambodia
 nepal ke shambhunath, bodhanath, mamnath mandir, lanka main anuradhapur kaa stupa or lankatilak mandir, barma ke buddha math or pagoda, cambodia main ankor ke mandir, syam main bainkak ke mandir, java main pranbanaam kaa bihar, kalasana mandir or borobandar stupa aadi hindu or buddha vaastu ke vyapak prasar ke pramaan hai
 Some evidence of the entry of Indian culture into Java is found in the 4th century AD

 Government efforts led to grand buildings like Raj Bhavan, Secretariat Building, Parliament House in New Delhi, which have a pleasant mix of Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim art with Western art
 mandir vaastu bhi, jo keval vyaktigat prayaas se apana astitv banaae rahaa, kuch kuch isi disha main jhukaa
 The practice of the Ashoka period inscriptions on the emulation of Muslim architecture re-established and writings began to find place in the temples, outside, with statues and paintings

 Atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of a modern framework for atomic orbital models, in this case the suboptimal behavior of electrons

 is arth main, electronon nimnlikhit gun hote hai : Wave-like properties: 1
 Electrons do not revolve around the nucleus in the sense of a planet orbiting the sun, but instead exist as standing waves
 sambhav sabase kam urja ek electron le ja sakate hai isliye ek taar par ek lahar kii moulik aavriti ke anuroop he

 Particle-like properties: 1
 There is always an integer number of electrons orbiting the nucleus
 2

 For example, if a photon strikes electrons, only one electron changes in response to the photon
 3

 Each wave state has a single discrete spin
 It can depend on its superposition

 Also, atomic orbits are not closely similar to the elliptical path of a planet in ordinary atoms

 Atomic orbitals actually describe the shape of this "atmosphere" when only one electron is present in an atom

 Alternatively, atomic orbitals are functions that depend on the coordination of an electron but wave functions that all electrons in an atom or molecule are simultaneously used as starting points to make estimates dependent on coordinates See for are

 Thomson's discovery of the electron in 1897, along with JJ, makes it clear that atoms were not the formation of the smallest blocks of nature, but composite particles
 kai pariksha parmaanuon ke bheetar nai khoj kii sanrachana kii kalpana kaise parmaanu ghatak bhaagon ek duusare ke saath baatcheet ho sakati he
 Thomson speculates that many electrons revolve in orbit-like rings within a positively charged jelly-like substance, and between the discovery of the electron and 1909, this "plum pudding model" is the most widely accepted of the atomic structure Was the description
 fouran thomson kii khoj ke baad, hantaaro nagaoka electronic sanrachana ke liye ek alag model kii bhavishyavaanee kii
 Unlike the plum pudding model, the positive charge in Nagaoka's "saturnian model" was centered in a central core, pulling electrons in circular orbits reminiscent of Saturn's rings

 Nevertheless, the Saturnian model turned out to have more in common with any modern theory than its contemporaries

 n = 1 is the lowest energy possible in an orbital atom
 kii n en prayek kramik ucch mulya urja ke ek ucch str kii he, lekin antar ke rup main n bad jaati he ghat jaati he
 For high n, the energy level becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom

 When the increase in energy of l = 2 orbital becomes so large as the energy of the S-orbital in the next higher shell as pushing the energy of the orbital upwards; When l = 3 energy is pushed two steps higher in the shell

 yadi gaadi halaki he or inamen gharshan nahin hota
 So its speed will be faster
 is gaadi ke is prakaar chalane kaa kaaran yahan kaha jaataa he ki yah gas chhed se baahar nikalati he to baahar kii hawa se takaraati he or isi kaaran gaadi aage bad jaati he, parantu vastusthiti yah nahin he
 If it is run at a place without air, then its speed will be more rapid
 isliye yah keval pratikriya hi he isko chalaati he
 In this way, this power is obtained due to the pressure of the retreating tube
 jahaan adhik chaal kii aavashyaktaa hui vahaan kshippranodan kaa upyog kiya gaya
 In fact, the practice of tricyclic will be successful only where more speed is required
 yudhkaal main samay kii bachat ke liye kship hawaii jahaaj kii unnati hui or udanevaale bamgolon main iskaa upyog hua
 The friction in ground machines is high
 or ve teevr gati se nahin chalaai ja saktin
 Therefore, trituration was not beneficial in them
 kshippranodan kii vaastavik unnati hawaii tathaa pani ke jahaajon main hui
 The light engines and rapid movement of such airplanes have reduced the time so much that it can be reached from one corner of the world to another in a very short time
 kshippranodan ke liye sabhi prakaar ke injanon ke nimitt ek hi niyam hai
 All the engines pull the outside air in themselves and the air and fuel are mixed inside it, where both are burnt
 is failaav ke kaaran mashin ko dhakka lagata he
 At the time of burning, fuel and air dissipate more and when the machine is running, the air mixture becomes more
 hawa tathaa inrdhan ke jalane se jo gas taiyaar hoti he usko adhik gati di jaati he
 The gas can gain more speed at the same time it is given the opportunity to spread properly
 parantu is failaav main gas kii daab ghat jaaygi, kyonki gas ko usee hawa main chhodana he jahaan se hawa ko eendhan ke saath milaane ke liye bheetar khinchaa gaya tha
 Therefore, full power will not be obtained by decreasing the pressure
 jab tak gas ke peeche puri daab nahin hogi, pranodan samarth na hoga
 Therefore, a compressive machine is arranged to get full pressure behind the gas
 is sampidak ko chalaane ke liye gas tarabine lagaaya jaataa he
 The compressor pulls the air out and throws it with full force towards the turbine
 tarabine tathaa sampidak ke bich eendhan ko isi hawa main mila diya jaataa he or is mishran ko jalane kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 By its burning, the volume and temperature increase at the same pressure
 yah shakti itani hoti he ki isse tarabine bhi chalaaya ja sake or kship ke liye bhi isamen puri gatij urja rah jaae
 The compressor pulls air to the combustion chamber, where the fuel is pre-ignited and this gas goes to the turbine at higher temperatures
 tarabine is gas se chalata he or yah tarabine sampidak ko bhi chalaata he
 This gas comes out of the turbine and exits at high pressure, spreading like a spur
 chalane ke samay yah tarabine duusare injanon se kam eendhan letaa he, parantu gati bad jane par yah sab injanon se kam eendhan letaa he
 Reaching a height, it consumes even less fuel
 is tarabine se chalanevaale hawaii jahaaj kii gati aavashyaktaanusaar nahin hoti
 For saving time and long journeys it is necessary that the weight of the airplane is reduced and the speed is high
 yadi hawaii jahaaj main keval kshippranodan hi ho, jisamen tarabine kaa upyog na ho to aisa ho saktaa he
 Many machines are not required in its machine
 is mashin ke keval teen bhaag he
 The first part is the front which has valves for air and the fuel hose through which the fuel is thrown from the pump
 in kapaaton ke samay par khulne se hawa bheetar jaati he
 These valves are closed when fuel and air burns to become gas
 eendhan ke jalane par dhadaaka hota he or gas baahar kii ore bhaagti he
 The second part is of the combustion chamber and the third part is of the drain behind the engine, the length of which is kept according to the power of the engine
 jab isko chalaanaa hota he to isamen sabase pehle eendhan chhidaka jaataa he or aag laga di jaati he
 At this time air valves open and the air comes in and mixes with the fuel
 milawat thik prakaar se kii jaati he
 The mixture of fuel and air burns in about 2 milliseconds and its temperature is 250 C
 And the pressure increases by 100 percent
 ab yah gas naalee kii ore jaati he to naalee main jane se pehle yah failati he
 When it goes into the drain, its temperature is 9000 c due to the diameter of the drain
 And the pressure decreases to 95 percent
 kothri se baahar nikalne tak kaa samay 8 milisecond ho saktaa he
 Thus the explosion caused by the mixture of fuel and air occurs quickly after each other
 isi dhadaake ke bal par or gas ke teevr gati se baahar nikalne ke kaaran pranodan ke liye mashin milti he
 The fuel is first burnt with electricity, but when the machine is running, the combustion chamber is so hot that the fuel burns on its own
 eendhan kii naalee kii lambaai itani rakhi jaati he ki hawa ke kapaat khulne se pehle hi jali hui gas baahar nikal jaae
 This type of machine was used in bombing you and is now used in airplanes, but it requires long space to run and must be high speed while running
 pehle yah vichaar tha ki piston ingine ke sthaan par kshippranodan kaa vyavhaar karne par bahut zyada kal purajon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi, parantu aisa nahin hua
 With the use of tarnishing, it was discovered that only fuel pumps have to be made very carefully and it is absolutely necessary to keep the fuel and air under control
 maan len gas nikalne kaa pariman m prati second he or isaki gati ga he
 The power running the machine was increased
 yadi gas ke baahar nikalne ke sthaan kaa kshetrafal ksha he to is sthaan par do daaben hongi, ek to baahar nikalanevaali gas kii daab jo ni1 he or duusari is sthaan par hawa kii daab, jo, maan len, ni2 he
 These two pressures will be against each other
 isliye is sthaan par daab hogi ksha jo m x ga ke saath kaam karegi
 Therefore the full power of propulsion will be = xx + q
 yadi gas baahar nikalanevaali chhed ko aisa banaaya jaae ki gas falkar daab ni2 tak aa jaae to ni1= ni2, isliye shakti =m x ga
 This is called Samirikana of Pranodaya
 pranodan kaa karyanupaat nimnaankit sameekaran se dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Where c is the speed of speed and the speed of running of machine
 yah karyanupaat mahattam hoga yadi ga=r, arthath mashin kii chaal yadi kship kii chaal ke baraabar ho

 Rakshabandhan is a Hindu and Jain festival celebrated annually on the full moon day of the month of Shravan
 shravan main manaaye jane ke kaaran ise shrawani yaa saluno bhi kehete hai
 Rakhi or Rakshasutra has the most importance in Rakshabandhan
 raakhi kachche soot jaise sasti vastu se lekar rangeen kalave, reshmi dhaage, tathaa sone yaa chaandi jaisi manhagi vastu tak kii ho sakati he
 Rakhi is usually tied only by brothers, but respect is also tied by Brahmins, Gurus and younger girls in the family
 kabhi-kabhi saarvajanik rup se kisi netaa yaa pratishthit vyakti ko bhi raakhi baandhi jaati he
 Now the tradition of tying rakhi to trees has also started for conservation of nature
 hindustan main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke purush sadsy paraspar bhaichaare ke liye ek duusare ko bhagava rang kii raakhi bandhate hai
 The Karmakandi Pandit or Acharya chants a sloka in Sanskrit while tying Rakshasutra in all the religious rituals of Hinduism, in which the relation of Rakshabandhan is clearly visible to King Bali
 bhavishyapurana ke anusaar indrani dwaara nirmit rakshasutra ko devguru brihaspati ne indra ke haathon baandhte hue nimnlikhit swastivachan kiya - The Hindi sense of this verse is - "I bind you with the same thread that the great powerful Danavendra king Bali was tied
 he rakshe ! tum adig rahanaa " Retired from bathing in the morning, girls and women decorate a plate of worship
 thali main raakhi ke saath roli yaa haldi, chaaval, deepak, mithai or kuch paise bhi hote hai
 Boys and men get ready and sit in worship or any appropriate place to get the vaccine done

 But there is a description in the Bhavishya Purana that when the war started between Devas and Demons, demons started dominating
 bhagwaan indra ghabara kar brihaspati ke paas gayi
 Indrani, Indra's wife, was listening to everyone sitting there
 unhone resham kaa dhaagaa mantron kii shakti se pavitra karke apane pati ke haath par band diya
 Incidentally, it was the day of Shravan Purnima
 logon kaa vishwaas he ki indra is ladaai main isi dhaage kii mantra shakti se hi vijayi hue the
 From the same day on the day of Shravan Purnima, the practice of tying this thread is going on
 yah dhaagaa dhan, shakti, harsh or vijay dene main puri tarah samarth mana jaataa he
 In the Skandha Purana, Padmapuran and Srimad Bhagwat, the story of Rakshabandhan is found in the story called Vamnavatar
 katha kuch is prakaar he-danvendra raja bali ne jab 100 yajna purna kar swarg kaa rajya chhinane kaa praytn kiya to indra aadi devataaon ne bhagwaan vishnu se prarthana kii
 Then Lord Vamana took incarnation as a Brahmin and came to seek alms from King Bali
 guru ke manaa karne par bhi bali ne teen pag bhoomi daan kar di
 God measured the entire sky in three steps and sent King Bali to the abyss, measuring the earth
 is prakaar bhagwaan vishnu dwaara bali raja ke abhimaan ko chakanachur kar dene ke kaaran yah tyohaar balev naam se bhi prasiddh he
 It is said that once Bali went into the abyss, Bali sacrificed his devotion to God in front of him day and night
 bhagwaan ke ghar na lautne se pareshaan lakshmi ji ko naarad ji ne ek upaay bataaya
 Following that remedy, Lakshmi went to King Bali and tied her Rakshabandhan and made her her brother and brought her husband Lord Bali with her

 Another famous story is associated with Rakhi
 kehete hai, mewar kii rani karmavati ko bahadurshah dwaara mewar par hamalaa karne kii purv soochna mili
 The queen was unable to fight, so she sent a rakhi to Mughal emperor Humayun and asked for protection
 humayun ne musalmaan hote hue bhi raakhi kii laaj rakhi or mewar pahunch kar bahadurshah ke viruddh mewar kii ore se ladate hue karmavati va uske rajya kii raksha kii
 In another context, Sikandar's wife tied her husband's Hindu enemy ancestor to Rakhi and made her her brother-in-law and vowed not to kill Sikandar during the war
 puruvas ne yuddh ke dauraan haath main bandhi raakhi or apni bahan ko diye hue vachan kaa sammaan karte hue sikandar ko jivan-daan diya
 It is also mentioned in Mahabharata that when Jyestha Pandava Yudhishthira asked Lord Krishna how i can overcome all the troubles, Lord Krishna advised to celebrate Rakhi festival to protect him and his army
 unka kahana tha ki raakhi ke is reshmi dhaage main vah shakti he jisase aap har aapatti se mukti paa sakate hai
 At this time, there are many references of tying rakhi to Krishna by Draupadi and Abhimanyu by Kunti
 mahabharat main hi rakshabandhan se sambandhit krishna or draupadi kaa ek or vrittant bhi miltaa he
 When Krishna killed Shishupala with the Sudarshan Chakra, his index finger got hurt

 It is said that the spirit of mutual protection and cooperation started from here on the festival of Rakshabandhan
 anek saahitiyik granth aise hai jinamein rakshabandhan ke parv kaa vistrut varnan miltaa he
 The most important of these is the historical drama Raksha Bandhan of Harikrishna Lover, which has been published in the 18th edition in 1991
