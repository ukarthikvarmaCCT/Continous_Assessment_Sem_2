 The practice of exercising restraint and discretion goes on
 mandir, upashray, sthand tathaa samavasharan parisar main adhiktam samay tak rahanaa jaruri mana jaataa he
 By the way, Paryushan is not a festival of joy and joy like Deepawali and Christmas
 phir bhi unka prabhaav puure samaaj main dikhaai detaa he
 Thousands like fasting, Bela, Tela, Eighty, Masakhaman, without eating anything, without drinking anything, thousands of people doing nirjala penance get appreciation
 bharat ke alaava britain, america, canada, australia, japan, germany va anya anek deshon main bhi paryushan parv dhoomdhaam se manaae jate hai
 But the program of forgiveness or forgiveness on Paryushan festival is such that it gives a lot of inspiration to the non-public
 ise samuhik rup se vishwa-maitri diwas ke rup main manaaya ja saktaa he
 It is celebrated at the conclusion of Paryushan
 ganesh chaturthi yaa rishi panchami ko sanvatsari parv manaaya jaataa he
 On that day, people fast and criticize their sins and vow to avoid them in the future
 iske saath hi ve churaasi lakh yoniyon main vicharan kar rahe, samast jeevon se kshamaa maangate hue yah suchit karte hai ki unka kisi se koi bair nahin he
 Indirectly they pledge that they will not interfere in the environment
 man, vachan or kaaya se jaanate yaa ajaante ve kisi bhi hinsa kii gatividhi main bhaag na to swayan lenge, na dusron ko lene ko kahenge or na lene waalon kaa anumodan karenge
 In order to assure that they have no hatred of anyone, they also declare that they have forgiven all the creatures of the world and that those creatures need not fear the apologist
 khamemi savve jeeva, savve jeeva khamantu me
 Mittime sway bhuyes vairn mamjhan kanai
 yah vaakya paramparaagat jarur he, magar vishesh aashay rakhata he
 According to this, forgiveness is more important than apologizing
 kshamaa dene se aap anya samast jeevon ko abhaydaan dete hai or unki raksha karne kaa sankalp lete hai
 Then you will follow restraint and wisdom, feel spiritual peace and have a friendly attitude towards all beings and matter
 aatma tabhi shuddh rah sakati he jab vah apane sebaahar hastkshep na kare or bahari tatv se vichlit na ho
 Forgiveness is its core
 hindu dharm main ekadshi kaa vrath mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 Every year there are 24 Ekadashis
 jab adhikmas yaa malmaas aata he tab inaki sankhya badhkar 26 ho jaati he
 According to the legend prevailing about Jaya Ekadashi, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira pleads to Lord Krishna who should worship Magh Shukla Ekadashi, and what is the significance of this Ekadashi
 shri krishna kehete hai magh shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko "jaya ekadshi" kehete hai
 This Ekadashi is very virtuous, by observing this Ekadashi fast, one gets rid of the vagina of ghosts, ghosts, vampires such as the evil vagina

 The celebration was going on in Nandan Forest
 is utsav main sabhi devtaa, siddh sant or divya purush vartmaan the
 At that time Gandharvas were singing and Gandharva girls were performing dances
 sabha main malyawaan naamak ek gandharva or pushpavati naamak gandharva kanya kaa nrity chal rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, as soon as Pushyavati looked at Mallywan, she became fascinated by him
 pushyavati sabha kii maryaada ko bhuulakar aisa nrity karne lagi ki malyawaan uski ore aakarshith ho
 Malyavan Gandharva lost his mind on seeing the confession of the girl and lost the dignity of singing, leaving Sur Tal with her
 indra ko pushpavati or malyawaan ke amaryadit krity par krodh ho aayaa or unhone donon ko shraap de diya ki aap swarg se vanchit ho jaaen or prithvi par nivas karen
 May both of you have a very vampire vagina in the world of death
 is shraap se tatkaal donon pishaach ban gayi or himalay parvat par ek vriksh par donon kaa nivas ban gaya
 Here they had to suffer a lot in the vampire vagina
 ek baar magh shukla paksh kii ekadshi ke din dono atyant du:khee the us din ve keval falahar rahe
 At night, both of them were feeling very cold, so both of them sat awake throughout the night
 thandh ke kaaran donon kii mrityu ho gayi or anjaane main jaya ekadshi kaa vrath ho jane se donon ko pishaach yoni se mukti bhi mil gayi
 Now Mallyavan and Pushpavati became even prettier and found a place in heaven
 devraj ne jab donon ko dekha to chakit rah gayi or pishaach yoni se mukti kisi mili yah poocha
 Mallyavan said that this is the effect of Jaya Ekadashi of Lord Vishnu
 ham is ekadshi ke prabhaav se pishaach yoni se mukt hue hai
 Indra was very pleased with this and said that you are a devotee of Jagadishwar, hence you are respectable to me from now on, you should enjoy a paradise in heaven
 katha sunkaar shri krishna ne yah bataaya ki jaya ekadshi ke din jagapati jagdishwar bhagwaan vishnu hi sarvatha poojaneey hai
 Devotees who keep this fast on this Ekadashi should eat it at a time from Dashami
 is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki aahaar satvik ho
 On Ekadashi, meditate on Lord Vishnu and resolve and then worship Vishnu with incense, lamp, sandalwood, fruit, sesame, and panchamrit
 puure din vrath rakhen sambhav ho to raatri main bhi vrath rakhkar jaagran karen
 If fasting is not possible at night, you can do falahar
 dwadashi ke din brahmanon ko bhojan karwaakar unhen janeu supaari dekar vidaa karen phir bhojan karen
 In this way, by fasting with neem fidelity, the person is freed from the vampire vagina

 Typical or pure Hindi was not practiced
 yah lagbhag 18ve shatabdi ke armbh kaa samay tha jab kuch hindi gadhyakaron ne theth hindi main likhnaa shuru kiya
 This typical Hindi was called Khari Hindi or Khadi Hindi dialect
 khadi boli se taatpary khadi boli hindi se he jise bhartiya samvidhan ne rajbhasha ke rup main sweekrut kiya he
 From the point of view of linguistics, it has the distinction of being the basic foundation of ideal Hindi, Urdu and Hindustani
 khadi boli pashchim ruhelkhand, ganga ke uttari doaab tathaa ambala jile kii upbhasha he jo gramin janata ke dwaara maatrubhaasha ke rup main boli jaati he

 yah parinishthit pashchimi hindi kaa ek rup he
 'khadi Boli' is a form of present-day Hindi in which the current Hindi language was created by multiplying Sanskrit words and the current Urdu language was created by multiplying the words of Persian and Arabic
 duusare shabdon main, vah boli jisapar braj yaa avadhi aadi kii chhap na ho, thenth hindin
 Khadi Boli is the former form of today's national language Hindi
 yah parinishthit pashchimi hindi kaa ek rup he
 Its history has been going on for centuries
 jis samay musalmaan is desh main aakar bas gaye, us samay unhen yahan kii koi ek bhashaa grahan karne kii aavashyaktaa hui
 They had settled mostly in Delhi and its eastern provinces and could not adopt the Brajbhasha and Awadhi languages, due to their misery, so they accepted the dialect of Meerut and its surroundings and named it Khadi Boli
 isi khadi boli main ve dhire dhire farsi or arabi shabd milaate gaye jisase ant main vartmaan urdu bhashaa kii sristi hui
 Vikrami In the 14th century, Amir Khusro first started using this provincial dialect and wrote a lot of poetry in it, which being simple and succulent soon became prevalent
 bahut dinon tak musalmaan hi is boli kaa bolchaal or sahitya main vyavhaar karte rahe, par peeche hinduon main bhi iskaa prachaar hone laga
 In the 15th and 16th centuries, some Hindi poets also started using it somewhere in their poetry, but their number was often not the same
 adhikansh kavita baraabar avadhi or vrajabhasha main hi hoti rahi
 In the 18th century Hindus also began to treat it in literature, but not in poetry, only in prose; And since then, the present Hindi prose was born, whose Acharya Munshi Sadasukhlal, Lallu Ji Lal and Sadal Mishra are considered
 jis prakaar musalamaanon ne isamen farsi tathaa arabi aadi ke shabd bharkar vartmaan urdu bhashaa banaai, usee prakaar hinduon ne bhi usamen sanskrit ke shabdon kii adhikta karke vartmaan hindi prastut kii
 Here some people have started doing poetry in Sanskritpurchur current Hindi too and for the work of poetry, they call it Khadi Boli
 vartmaan hindi kaa ek rup jisamen sanskrit ke shabdon kii bahulata karke vartmaan hindi bhashaa kii or farsi tathaa arabi ke shabdon kii adhikta karke vartmaan urdu bhashaa kii sristi kii gai he
 In the literary context, modern Hindi literature is designated as Khadi Boli literature to segregate literature in the dialects of Braj, Awadhi etc
 yah bharatvarsh kii sarvaadhik prachlit, saral tathaa bodhgamy bhashaa he
 Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana are Hindi speaking states
 parantu inke atirikt sudur dakshin ke kuch sthanon ko chhodkar iskaa prachaar newnaadhik samast desh main he
 Khadi dialect has been designated by many names such as -hindai, Hindavi, Dakkhini, Dakhni or Dakni, Rekha, Hindostani, Hindustani etc
 dow grearsan ne ise varnacular hindustani tathaa dow suniti kumaar chatarji ne ise janapadiya hindustani kaa naam diya he
 Dr
 Chatterjee designates the literary form of Khadi Boli as Sadhu Hindi or Nagari Hindi
 parantu dow grearsan ne ise hai hindi kaa abhidhaan pradaan kiya he
 Different scholars have interpreted this differently
 in vidwaanon ke maton kii nimnaankit shreniyan he- Since ancient times, the land between the Himalayas and the Vindhya Mountains is known as Aryavarta
 isi ke bich ke pradesh ko madhya pradesh kaha jaataa he jo bhartiya samskruti tathaa sabhyataa kaa centrebindu he
 Sanskrit, Pali and Shaurseni Prakrit were the languages of this Madhya Pradesh in different eras
 kalkram se shauraseni praakrit ke pashchaat is pradesh main shauraseni apbhransh kaa prachaar hua
 This story has been converted into Shauraseni Apabhransh language, probably as a standing dialect
 is prakaar khadi boli kii utpatti shauraseni apbhransh se maani jaati he, yadhyapi is apbhransh kaa vikaas sahityak rup main nahin paaya jaataa
 The tradition of apabhramsa poems from the time of Bhoja and Hammirdev is reflected in the ancient form of the dialect standing within it
 iske uparaant bhaktikaal ke aarambh main nirgun dhara ke sant kavi khadi boli kaa vyavhaar apni sadhukkadi bhashaa main kiya karte the
 Some scholars are of the opinion that the standing dialect was brought into existence by Muslims and its original form is Urdu, from which the language of modern Hindi was created and extracted from Arabic Persian words
 suprasiddh bhashashasthri, dow grearsan ke matanusaar khadi boli angrejon kii dein he
 The demolition of the Mughal Empire helped in the promotion of the standing bid
 jis prakaar ujadati hui dilli ko chhodkar mir, insha aadi urdu ke anek shaayar purab kii ore aane lage usee prakaar dilli ke aasapaas ke hindu vyapaaree jeevika ke liye lakhanu, faijabad, prayag, kaashi, patna, aadi poorabi shaharon main failane lage
 Along with them, their colloquial language was also spoken
 is prakaar bade shaharon ke bazaar kii bhashaa bhi khadi boli ho gai
 This Khadi dialect was a real and natural language, not the urdu-e-muallah of the clerics and the Munshi
 19veen shatabdi ke purvardh ke sambandh main ve likhte hai ki yah samay hindi bhashaa ke janm kaa samay tha jiskaa avishkaar angrejon ne kiya tha or iskaa saahitiyik gadhy ke rup main sarvapratham prayog gilakraist kii ajna se lallu ji laal ne apane premsagar main kiya
 Lalluji Lal and Pt
 Sadal Mishra may be considered as the masters of the standing bidder or the progressor of it, but to call them the originators of the standing bid is true and not substantiated by the facts
 khadi boli kii pracheen parampara ke sambandh main dhyanpurvak vichaar karne par is kathan kii ayatharthata swayamev siddh ho jaati he
 Must have been helped in its spread by the Muslims
 urdu koi swatantra bhashaa nahin balki khadi boli kii hi ek style maatr he jisamen farsi or arabi ke shabdon kii adhikta pai jaati he tathaa jo farsi lipi main likhi jaati he
 This is clearly proved by focusing on the history of Urdu literature
 anek musalmaan kaviyon ne farsi mishrit khadi boli main, jise ve 'rekhta' kehete the, kavita kii he
 This tradition continued till Bahadur Shah, the last emperor of Delhi in the 18th-19th century and Wajidali Shah, the last Nawab of Lucknow
 saadhaarant: lallu ji laal, sadal mishra, inshwalla khan tathaa munshi sadasukhlal khadi boli gadhy ke pratishthapak kahe jate hai parantu inamen se kisi ko bhi isaki parampara ko pratishthit karne kaa saubhaahgya praapt nahin he
 The reputation of the modern Khadi Boli prose tradition is attributed to Bharatendu Babu Harishchandra and King Shivprasad Starshind who enforced a simple unanimous prose style through their works
 kalantar main logon ne bhaaratendu kii style adhik apanaai
 In fact, modern Hindi literature is the literature of the Khadi dialect for which Devanagari script is commonly treated and in which the words and motifs of Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit etc
 are present in the shadow of many languages and genologies prevalent in the country

 vishyaki gaharaai main jaakar dekhen to yah tyohaar krishi evam fasal se sambandhit devataaonko samarpit he

 If seen in both the forms, then it comes out that boiling well and offering prasad to the Sun God
 pongal kaa mahatv isliye bhi he kyonki yah tamil maheene kii pehali taarikh ko armbh hota he
 The importance of this festival can also be gauged from the fact that it lasts for four days

 It starts in January
 pehali pongal ko bhogi pongal kehete hai jo devraj indra kaa samarpit hai

 Friedrich Engels named the socio-economic-political theory propounded by Karl Marx as scientific socialism
 marks ne yadhyapi kabhi bhi vaigyanik samaajwaad shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya kintu unhone utopian samaajwaad kii aalochana kii
 Marx is considered the pioneer of scientific socialism
 marks german desh ke ek rajya kaa rahanevaala tha or germany 1871 i
 ke purv raajnneetik rup se kai rajyon main vibhajit, tathaa aarthik drushti se pichhadaa hua tha
 Hence, the promotion of socialist ideas was delayed here
 yadhyapi johaan fikhte ke vichaaron main samaajwaad kii jhalak he, parantu germany kaa sarvapratham or pramukh samaajawaadee vichaarak karl marks hi mana jaataa he
 Marx's ideas are influenced by Hegel's idealism, Forvac's materialism, Britain's classical economics, and France's revolutionary politics
 marks ne apane purvagami or samakaleen samaajawaadee vichaaron kaa samanvay kiya he
 His integral friends and cooperative Angels have also given socialist views, but they mostly explain Marx's principles, hence his writings are considered part of Marxism
 marks ke darshan ko dwandvatmak bhautikwaad kaha jaataa he
 For Marx, the idea of reality is not merely a physical truth; Thought itself is a developed form of matter
 uskaa bhautikwaad, vikasvan he parantu yah vikaas dwandvatmak prakaar se hota he
 Thus Marx is opposed to Hegel's ideology but accepts his dialectical system
 marks ke vichaaron kii duusari visheshta uskaa aitihaasik bhautikwaad he
 Some authors also call it an economical interpretation of history
 marks ne siddh kiya ki saamaajik parivartanon kaa aadhaar utpaadan ke saadhan or usase prabhavit utpaadan sambandhon main parivartan hai
 Man always advances in the means of production according to his talent, but a situation comes when the production relations are also affected due to this and the struggle between the owners of the means of production - the exploiters - and the exploited class using these means
 It starts swami puraani avasthaa ko kaayam rakhkar shoshan kaa kram jari rakhana chahta he, parantu shoshit varg kaa or samaaj kaa hit nae utpaadan sambandh sthapit kar nae utpaadan ke sadhano kaa prayog karne main hota he
 Thus, the class struggle between the exploiters and the exploited takes the form of revolution and through it a new society is born
 isi prakriya dwaara samaaj adikalin kabyli samyawad, pracheen gulaami, madhyakaalin samantvaad or aadhunik poonjeewaad, in avasthaaon se gujara he
 The history so far is the history of class struggle, even today there is this struggle between the capitalist and the proletariat, which will end with the establishment of socialism by the proletarian revolution
 bhavi samyavaadee avasthaa is samaajawaadee samaaj kaa hi ek shreshth rup hogi
 Marx has done a deep and detailed analysis of capitalist society
 uski pramukh pustak kaa naam das poonji he
 In this regard, his Argh and additional Argh theories are main
 uskaa kahana he ki poonjeewaadi samaaj kii visheshta adhikanshat: panyon kii paidaavaar he, poonjipati adhiktar chijen bechney ke liye banaata he, apane prayog maatr ke liye nahin
 Merchandise is bought and sold on the basis of its earnings
 parantu poonjeewaadi samaaj main majdoor kii shramashakti bhi panya ban jaati he or vah bhi apane argh ke aadhaar par bechi jaati he
 The basis of the Argh of everything is the socially necessary labor used in it, whose criterion is time
 majdoor apni shramashakti dwaara poonjipati ke liye bahut samathrya paidaa karata he, parantu uski shramashakti kaa argh bahut kam hota he
 The difference between these two is extra Argh and this additional Argh which is the basis of labor, is the basis of capitalist profits, interest, commission etc
 saransh yah ki poonji kaa strot shramshoshan he
 This idea of marx encourages class struggle
 poonjeewaad kii visheshta he ki isamen spardhaa hoti he or bada poonjipati chote poonjipati ko parrast kar uskaa naash kar detaa he tathaa uski poonji kaa swayan adhikari ho jaataa he
 He also re-appropriates his capital and his profits in the order of production
 is prakaar poonji or paidaavaar donon kii vruddhi hoti he
 But because wages do not increase in proportion to this, the working class is unable to buy this yield, and because of this the capitalist system is prone to economic crises from time to time in which excess yield and unemployment and starvation are found together
 is avasthaa main poonjeewaadi samaaj utpaadanshaktiyon kaa purna rup se prayog karne main asamarth hota he
 Hence, class struggle increases between the capitalist and the proletariat and in the end the society has no other option but to establish the proletarian revolution and socialism
 saamaajik paimaane par utpaadan parantu uske upar vyaktigat swaamitv, marks ke anusaar yah poonjeewaadi vyavastha kii asangati he jise saamaajik swaamitv kii sthapana kar samaajwaad dur karata he
 Regarding the state, Marx's belief was that it is the instrument of rule or oppression of the exploiting class

 matsay paalan prarambh karne se purv yah atyadhik aavashyak he ki machhlee kaa beej daalane ke liye talab purna rup se upyukt ho
 Excessive aquatic plants in the pond are harmful for good fish yield
 yah paudhe pani kaa bahut bada bhaag ghere rahete hai jisamen machhlee ke ghoomane-phirane main asuvidha hoti he
 At the same time, they also create a barrier to the rays of the sun reaching inside the water
 parinamswaroop machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan utpann hona ruuk jaataa he or prakritik bhojan ke abhaav main machhlee kii vruddhi par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Apart from this, these plants increase their potency by polluting the chemical substances found in the soil and the nutritional value of water is reduced
 machhlee pakadaney ke liye yadi jaal chalaaya jaay tab bhi yah paudhe rukawat daalate hai
 Generally, there are three types of aquatic plants in ponds - one with water surface such as hyacinth, lemna etc
, second root-like lotus etc
 and third water-immersed like hydrilla, najaj etc
 yadi talab main jaleey paudhon kii maatra kam ho to inhen jaal chalaakar yaa shramik lagaakar jad se ukhadkar nikaala ja saktaa he
 In case of excess aquatic vegetation, use of chemicals such as 2-4 d sodium salts, teficide, hexamar and Fernaxan in 8-10 kg per hectare water field, water hyacinth, lotus etc
 are destroyed
 rasayanon ke prayog ke samay vishesh jaankaree matsay vibhaag ke karyaalayon se praapt kii jaani chahie
 Some submerged plants are the favorite food of grass carp fish, so they can be prevented by grasping grapes in the pond
 upyukt yahi he ki anaavashyak paudhon kaa unmoolan maanav-shakti se hi sunishchit kiya jaay
 In the old ponds many unnecessary animals like turtles, frogs, crabs and fishes like Sindhri, Puthiya, Chelwa etc
 and eater fishes are found for example Pichin, Tangen, Saul, Girai, Singhi, Mangur etc
 which are available to feed the food available in the pond
 Receive as food
 maansaahaari machhliyaan carp machhliyon ke bacchon ko kha jaati he jisase matsay paalan par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Therefore, their cleanliness is absolutely necessary
 avaanchhneeya machhliyon kaa nishkasana baar-baar jaal chalaakar yaa pani nikaal kar athwa mahua kii khali ke prayog dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Mahu cake should be used in a pond with a depth of one meter of water in one hectare area at the rate of 25 quintals
 iske parinaam swaroop 6-8 ghanton main sari machhliyaan mar kar upar aa jaati hai jinhen jaal chalaakar ekatra karke bazaar main bechaa ja saktaa he
 Use of Mahu's cake has double effect for the pond
 vish ke alaava 15-20 din baad yah khaad kaa bhi kaary karti he jisase machhlee ke prakritik bhojan kaa utpaadan hota he
 Light alkaline watering is beneficial for fisheries
 pani amleey athwa adhik kshareey nahin hona chahie
 Lime increases the alkalinity of water or balances the acidicity and alkalinity of water
 iske atirikt chuunaa machhliyon ko vibhinn paropjiviyon ke prabhaav se mukt rakhata he or talab kaa pani upyukt banaata he
 250 kg of lime in one hectare pond should be used one month before fish seed accumulation
 talab kii taiyaari main gobar kii khaad kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This produces natural fish food
 gobar kii khaad, matsay beej sanchay se 15-20 din purv saamaanthya 10-20 ton prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kii jaani chahie
 If the mahua cake has been poured in the preparation of the pond for the removal of undesirable fish, then there is no need to put the first installment of cow dung
 saamanyat: rasinic khaadon main uria 200 kilogram, singil super phosphate 250 ki0gra0 va murat of potash 40 ki0gra0 arthath kul mishran 490 ki0gra0 prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kiya janaa chahie
 In this way, a mixture of chemical fertilizer of 49 kg per hectare per month should be put in the pond after 15 days of use of cow dung
 yadi talab ke pani kaa rang gaharaa haraa yaa gaharaa nila ho jaye to urvarkon kaa prayog tab tak band kar dena chahie jab tak pani kaa rang uchit avasthaa main na aa jaye
 Accumulation of pure seeds of such good fish species in the pond should be ensured that, while staying in the same aquatic environment, do not harm each other and consume the food available on different surfaces of the pond and grow rapidly
 bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu evam nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp evam kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan vishesh laabhakaari hota he
 Pure seed of the best fish species is a basic requirement of fisheries

 Special emphasis is being given to privatization of fish seed production with the objective of making Uttar Pradesh self-sufficient in the field of fish seed production and up to Rs 8
00 lakh for setting up a mini fish seed hatchery with a capacity of 10 million in the private sector
 Facility of loan and 10 percent government grant is permissible
 matsay paalak nijee kshetron main sthapit chote aakaar kii hechariyon se bhi shuddh beej praapt kar sakate hai
 Such fish species should be reared in the pond, which will grow rapidly by using the food available on each surface without harming each other by living together in an environment so that maximum fish production from a confined water area To be sure bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu, nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp va kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan kaaphi laabhakaari hota he
 Before storing fish seed in the pond, it is worth noting that preparations have been completed and organic production has been done
 machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan jise planctan kehete hai paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hona chahie
 The availability of one milliliter of plant in 50 liters of water in the pond indicates that fish seed can be stored
 ek he0 jal kshetra main 50 mi0me0 aakaar se kam kaa 10,000 matsay beej tathaa 50 mi0me0 se adhik aakaar kii 5000 angulikaayen sanchit kii jaani chahie
 If six types of domestic and foreign carp fishes are being mixed, then the ratio of katla 20 percent silver carp 10 percent, rohu 30 percent, grass carp 10 percent, nan 15 percent and common carp 15 percent is appropriate
 yadi silver carp va grass carp machhliyon kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he or 4 prakaar kii machhliyaan paali ja rahi hai to sanchay anupaat katala 40 pratishat, rohu 30 pratishat, nain 15 pratishat va kaaman carp 15 pratishat hona laabhakaari hota he
 If only Indian major carp fishes are being reared then the ratio of katla 40 percent, rohu 30 percent, nan 30 percent should be
 kaaman carp machhlee kaa beej march, april va may main tathaa anya carp machhliyon kaa beej july, agast, sitambar main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For high yields of fish, it is absolutely necessary to have suitable soil and water in the pond
 aisi mitti jisamen sand 40 pratishat tak, silt 30 pratishat tathaa clay 30 pratishat ho evam pi-ech 6
5 se 7

 When the percentage of sand in the soil is high, there is a problem of water in the pond
 adhik kshareey mrudaa bhi matsay paalan hetu upyukt nahin hoti he
 The soil of the pond should contain 50 mg of nitrogen and 6 mg of phosphorus per 100 grams of soil and one percent organic carbon
 yadi uplabdh nitrogen, phosphorus evam argenic carbon saamaanya se kam he to nirdhaarit matraaon main jaivik va rasaynic urvarkon kaa prayog karte hue talab ko matsay paalan hetu upyukt banaaya ja saktaa he
 The color of the water of the pond is light brown because the natural food plantation of fish is available in this type of water

 vaise to umr main tukojirao holkar ahilyabai se bade the, parantu tukoji unhen apni mata ke samaan hi maanate the or rajya kaa kaam puri lagan ore sachai ke saath karte the
 Ahilyabai had so much love and trust in her that she too considered him like a son

 mahabharat hinduon kaa ek pramukh kavy granth he, jo smriti ke itihaas varg main aata he
 Sometimes it is simply called "india"
 yah kavyagranth bharat kaa anupam dharmik, puranic, aitihaasik or darshanik granth hai
 It is the world's longest literary text and epic, one of the main texts of Hinduism
 is granth ko hindu dharm main pancham veda mana jaataa he
 Although it is considered to be one of the most unique works of literature, even today, this book is an exemplary source for every Indian
 yah kriti pracheen bharat ke itihaas kii ek gaatha he
 In this, the most sacred book of Hinduism is contained in the Bhagavad Gita
 puure mahabharat main lagbhag 1,10,000 shloke hai, jo unani kaavyon elliod or odissi se pariman main das guna adhik hai
 According to Hindu beliefs, mythological references and the Mahabharata itself, the creator of this poem is considered to be Vedavas ji
 is kavy ke rachayita vedavyas ji ne apane is anupam kavy main vedon, vedangon or upanishdon ke guhyatam rahasyon kaa nirupan kiya hai
 Apart from this, justice, education, medicine, astrology, warfare, yogashastra, economics, architecture, craftsmanship, kamshastra, astronomy and theology are also described in detail in this poem
 vedavyas ji ko mahabharat puraa rachane main 3 varsh lag gayi the, iskaa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki us samay lekhan lipi kala kaa itnaa vikaas nahi hua tha, us kaal main rishiyon dwaara vaidic granthon ko peedi dar peedi paramparaagat maukhik rup se yaad karke surakshit rakhaa jaataa tha
 Sanskrit was the language of the sages at that time and Brahmi was the language of common language
 is prakaar rishiyon dwaara sampoorn vaidic sahitya maukhik rup se yaad kar peedi dar peedi sahastron varshon tak yaad rakhaa gaya
 Then gradually, with the fall of the Vedic era due to the influence of time, the style of memorizing the Vedic literature of the sages disappeared, since then the practice of writing Vedic literature on manuscripts became safe
 yah sarvamaanya he ki mahabharat kaa aadhunik rup kai avasthaaon se guzar kar bana he
 Four early stages of its creation have been identified by scholars
 ye avasthaaen sambhavit rachana kaal kram main nimna likhit hai: Saraswati River dwarka Devi Saraswati Chav Tato Jayamudirayet
 
 The Mahabharata is a story of a war between two families of the Kauravas and the Pandavas of the Chandravanshi
 100 kaurav bhaaiyon or paanch pandav bhaaiyon ke bich bhoomi ke liye jo sangharsh chalaa usase antat: mahabharat yuddh kaa srijan hua
 Several different dates have been set by Indian and Western scholars of this war
 mukhya ullekh :mahabharat kii vistrut katha According to the Puranas, Brahma was born from Atri, Atri to the Moon, Moon to Mercury and Mercury to ila-nandan Pururava
 unase aayu, aayu se raja nahush or nahush se yayati utpann hue
 Purified by Yayati
 puru ke vansh main bharat or bharat ke kul main raja kuru hue
 Shantanu happened in the lineage of Kuru
 shantanu se ganganandan bhishma utpann hue
 From Shantanu, Chitrangad and Vichitravirya were born from Satyavati's womb
 chitrangad naam vaale gandharv ke dwaara maare gayi or raja vichitraveery rajyakshma se grast ho swargavaasi ho gayi
 Then by the order of Satyavati, Vyasji produced Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika and Pandu from the womb of Ambalika by Neog
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari dwaara sau putron ko janm diya, jinamein duryodhana sabase bada tha or pandu ke yudhistor, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was made king in his place
 ek baar van main akhet khelte hue pandu ke baan se ek maithunarat mrigarupadhari rishi kii mrityu ho gayi
 Cursed by that sage, "now whenever you are maltreated, you will die", Pandu becomes very sad and abandons all lusts including his queens and makes Dhritarashtra in Hastinapur to live in the forest
 raja pandu ke kehane par kunti ne durvasa rishi ke diye mantra se dharm ko aamantrit kar unase yudhisthir or kaalaantar main vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna ko utpann kiya
 Madri gave birth to that mantra from Kunti and gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva from Ashwankumar
 ek din raja pandu maadri ke saath van main sarita ke tat par bhraman karte hue pandu ke man chanchal ho jane se maithun main pravruth huye jisase shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons
 kunti ne vivaah se pehle surya ke ansh se karn ko janm diya or loklaj ke bhay se karn ko ganga nadi main baha diya
 Adhiratha, the charioteer of Dhritarashtra, saved him and followed him
 karn kii ruchi yudhkala main thi atah dronacharya ke manaa karne par usne parashuram se shiksha praapt kii
 Duryodhana tried to kill the Pandavas many times in his childhood due to Shakuni's treachery and even in his youth, when Yudhishthira was made the crown prince, he tried to send the Pandavas to Lakshagraha, the home of Laksha, and burn them with fire, but the aid of Vidur
 Due to this, they got out of that burning house
 pandav vahaan se ekachakra nagari gayi or muni kaa vesh banaakar ek brahman ke ghar main nivas karne lage
 Then at the behest of Vyas ji, he went to Panchal kingdom where Draupadi was going to be a swayamvara
 vahaan ek ke baad ek sabhi raajaaon evam rajkumaron ne machhlee par nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi
 After this, Arjuna, seeing the reflection in Telapatra, penetrated Matsya with a single arrow and Draupadi went ahead and put a garland on Arjun's neck
 mata kunti ke vachananusaar paanchon pandavon ne draupadi ko patnirup main praapt kiya
 At the time of Draupadi's swayamvara, along with Duryodhana, Drupada, Dhritadumayan and many others had suspected that they were only five Brahmin Pandavas
 atah unki pariksha karne ke liye drupad ne unhen apane rajaprasaad main bulaayaa
 In Rajprasad, Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna showed the first treasury but the Pandavas did not show any interest in Ratnabhushans and ratna-manikya etc
 kept there
 kintu jab ve shastraagaar main gayi to vahaan rakhe astr-shastron main un sabhi ne bahut adhik ruchi dikhaayi or apni pasand ke shastron ko apane paas rakh liya
 Their activity convinced Drupada that they are Pandavas as Brahmins
 draupadi swayamvar se purv vidura ko chhodkar sabhi pandavon ko mrit samajhane lage or is kaaran dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya
 In order to avoid the crisis of civil war, Yudhishthira accepted Khandav forest as half the state in the ruins given by Dhritarashtra
 vahaan arjuna ne shrikrishna ke saath milakar samast devataaon ko yuddh main parrast karte hue khandvavan ko jala diya or indra ke dwaara kii hui vrishti kaa apane baanon ke chhatrakaar band se nivaaran karke agni dev ko trupt kiya
 As a result, Arjuna received the divine Gandiva bow and the best chariot from Agnidev and Shri Krishna received the Sudarshan Chakra
 indra apane putr arjuna kii veerta dekhakar atiprasann hue
 He removed the forests of Khandavaprastha
 uske uparaant pandavon ne shrikrishna ke saath may daanav kii sahaayta se us shahar kaa soundaryikaran kiya
 The city became like a second heaven
 indra ke kehane par dev shilpi vishwakarma or may daanav ne milakar khandav van ko indrapuri jitne bhavy nagar main nirmit kar diya, jise indraprastha naam diya gaya
 The Pandavas, while conquering all directions, performed a Rajsuya yagna, complete with abundant gold
 unka vaibhav duryodhana ke liye asay ho gaya atah shakuni, karn or duryodhana aadi ne yudhisthir ke saath jue main pravrutt hokar uske bhaaiyo, draupadi or unke rajya ko kapat dyut ke dwaara hanste-hanste jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But Gandhari came and stopped this from happening
 dhritarashtra ne ek baar phir duryodhana kii prerana se unhen se jua khilne kii ajna di
 It was decided that whichever side would lose in a single stake, they would wear deer for twelve years and remain in exile for one year
 us ek varsh main bhi yadi unhen pahchaan liya gaya to phir se baarah varsh kaa vanvaas bhogana hoga
 Thus Yudhishthira, after being defeated in gambling, went to the forest with his brothers
 vahaan barahawaan varsh bitne par ek varsh ke agyatavaas ke liye ve viraat nagar main gayi
 When the Kauravas started carrying Virat's cows, they were defeated by Arjuna
 us samay kauravon ne pandavon ko pahchaan liya tha parantu unka kaa agyatavaas tab tak puraa ho chukaa tha
 But even after completing 12 years of known and one-year exile, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 bhishma ne das dinon tak yuddh karke pandavon kii adhikansh sena ko apane baanon se maar giraaya
 Bhishma's death was subject to his will
 shrikrishna ke suzav par pandavon ne bhishma se hi unki mrityu kaa upaay poocha
 Bhishma said that the Pandavas fought the battle in front of Shikhandi
 bhishma use kanya hi maanate the or use saamne paakar wo shastr nahin chalaane vaale the
 And Shikhandi also had to avenge the humiliation of his previous birth and for that he took a boon from Shiva that Bhishma's death would be the reason
 10ve din ke yuddh main arjuna ne shikhandi ko aage apane rath par bithaaya or shikhandi ko saamne dekh kar bhishma ne apana dhanush tyaag diya or arjuna ne apni banvrishti se unhen baanon ki shayya par sula diya
 Then Acharya Drona assumed the charge of generalship
 phir se donon paksho main bada bhayankar yuddh hua
 Virat and Drupada etc
 were drowned in the sea by King Dronopi
 lekin jab pandavo ne chhal se dron ko yah vishwaas dilaa diya ki ashwatthama maaraa gaya
 So Acharya Drona was disappointed and gave up his weapon and left his body after taking yoga samadhi
 aise samay main dhridhyumna ne yoga samadhi liye dron kaa mastak talwaar se kaat kar bhoomi par gira diya
 After Drona slaughter, Karna became the captain of the Kaurava army
 karn or arjuna main bhanti-bhanti ke astr-shastron se yukt mahabhayanak yuddh hua, jo devasur-sangram ko bhi maat karne vaala tha
 In the battle of Karna and Arjuna, Karna killed many heroes of the enemy side with his arrows
 yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya
 Due to the curse of Guru Parshuram, he finds himself unable to use the divine weapons and comes down to remove the wheel of the chariot
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna ko uske dwaara kiye abhimanyu vadh, kuru sabha main draupadi ko veshya or uski karn vadh karne kii pratigya yaad dilaakar use maarane ko kehete he, tab arjuna ne ek divine astr se karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 Subsequently, King Shalya became the commander of the Kaurava army, but he could last only half a day in the war
 dopaher hote-hote raja yudhisthir ne unhen maar diya
 Duryodhana's entire army was killed, and in the end he had a miserable battle with Bhimsen
 bhim ne chhal se uski jaangh par prahaar karke use maar daalaa
 To take revenge of this, Ashwatthama put an Akshauhini army of Pandavas, the five sons of Draupadi, her Panchaldeshi brothers and Dhritadhyumna to sleep forever
 tab arjuna ne ashwatthama ko parrast karke uske mastak kii mani nikaal lee
 Ashwatthama then used Brahmastra on Uttara's womb
 uskaa garbh uske astr se praaia dagdh ho gaya tha, kintu bhagwaan shrikrishna ne usko pun: jivan-daan diya
 The same womb of Uttara later became known as King Parikshit
 is yuddh ke ant main kritavarma, kripacharya tathaa ashwatthama teen kauravapakshiya or paanch pandav, saatyaki tathaa shrikrishna ye saat pandavapakshiya vir jivit bache
 Yudhishthira then came to the throne
 brahmanon or gandhari ke shaap ke kaaran yadavakul kaa sanhaar ho gaya
 Balbhadra left his body with yoga and went into the ocean as Sheshnag
 bhagwaan krishna ke sabhi praputra ek din mahamuniyon kii shakti dekhne ke liye ek ko stri banaakar muniyon ke paas gaye or poocha ki he munishreshth! yah mahila garbh se he, hamen bataaen ki iske garbh se kiskaa janm hoga? muniyon ko gyaat hua ki yah balak unase krida karte hue ek purush ko mahila bana unke paas laae hai
 The sages cursed Krishna's great-grandchildren that a pestle will lick from this human's womb, which will end your dynasty
 krishna ke prapautron nen us moosal ko pathar par ragad kar chura bana nadi main baha diya tathaa uske nok ko phenk diya
 All of Krishna's great-grandchildren died from the leaves of the tree produced from that powder
 yah dekh shrikrishna bhi ek ped ke neeche dhyaan lagaakar beth gayi
 a hunter named 'zara' placed the tip of the pestle on the tip of his arrow and struck the arrow with the footstool of Lord Krishna as an antelope
 us baan dwaara krishna ke pair kaa chumban unke paramdhaam gaman kaa kaaran bana
 The Lord departed Goloka with his entire body
 iske baad samudr ne dwarkapuri ko apane jal main dubaa diya
 Subsequently, upon hearing the news of the destruction of the Yadavas from the mouth of Arjuna returning from Dwarka, Yudhishthira, considering the impermanence of the world, placed Parikshit on the Rajasana and took Draupadi and the brothers along the path of Mahaprasthana towards the Himalayas
 us mahapath main yudhisthir ko chhod sabhi ek-ek karke gir pade
 In the end, Yudhishthira climbed on Indra's chariot and went to heaven with his brothers
