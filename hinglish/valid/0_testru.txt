 hindi sahitya main reetikaal ko uttar madhyakaal, reetikavy, kalakaal, shringaarkaal, alankritkaal aadi naamon se janaa jaataa he 
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has fixed its time as 1700–1900
 reetikaal ke vishay main aksar yah aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki yah keval darbari kavy, saamanti kavy yaa phir nayak - nayika ke shariri prem, unke haav - bhav, nakh - sikh varnan tak simat kar rah gaya, kintu in baton ke alaava bhi reetikaal kii kuch apni visheshtaayen hai jo ise hindi sahitya ke anya kaalon se bhinn or vishesh banaati he 
 This era emerged in response to the devotion of the devotees, the rapid response to the above worldliness
 iskaa prabhaav reetikalin sahitya par yah hua ki ishwar kaa saamaanya nayak nayika ke rup main chithran hone laga 
 Reetikal itself has been a period in which poems filled with rituals, ethics, valor, adornment, depictions of nature, humor and humor were written
 jahaan ek taraf ‘ram chandrika' jaisaa prabandh kavy likhaa gaya to ‘bihari satsai' jaisaa muktak kavy, jahaan ek taraf lakshan granth likhe ja rahe the vahiin duusari taraf swachhandatavaadi prem kavy, jahaan ek taraf ‘shivaraj bhushan', ‘chhatrasaal dashak' jaise vir kavy likhe ja rahe the to duusari ore ‘khatmal baisi' jaise hasya kavy 
 While on one side the poems of "ahead of Sukavi Reejhi hai to Kavitai, neither Radhika Kanhai's Sumiran Bahan Hai hai" were being written, on the other hand "people are like lazy kavitta banawat, mohi to more kavita banawat"
 ‘nahush' naatak bhi isi kaal main likhaa gaya 
 Literature presents the true reality of society
 reetikalin adhiktar kavi darbari kavi the isliye unhone ucch varg, dhani vyaktiyon, raja maharaajaaon kii manovritiyon ko bakhubi chitrit kiya he 
 The hero, the heroine's love, beauty, howl finds a mixture of psychologicalism, which later became the center of cinematography and beyond, person-centered literature and psychological prose and poetry
 reetikaal kii andriyata, kalpana, bauddhikta kii parinti or swachhandatavaadi prem kavy kaa hi badhaav ‘chhayavaadi' kavy he 
 The poetic tradition of Reetikal, the construction of the characteristic text, later led to the rise of Hindi criticism
 bimb vidhaan, pratikon, udaahranon main ucch koti kii kushalta milti he, jab naye kavi bimbon, pratikon main nayepan kii baat karte hai to unpar bhi reetikaal ke chamatkaar, naye prayogon kii jhalak milti he 
 Which Bihari writes on one side - it aavati chali jati ut, chali chhasatak haath
 Climbed Hidoren, stayed with Usansanu
 
 So he writes on the other side - jap maala chhaapain tilak sarai na eku kaamu
 Mana kanchai nachhai bratha sanchai ranchai ramu
 
 Thus, looking at only one side, the literary work of Reetikal cannot be completely dismissed
