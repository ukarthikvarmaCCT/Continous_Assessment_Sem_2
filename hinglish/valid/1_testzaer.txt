 The periodic motion of these instruments is of very regular order
 inke saath anek daantedaar pahiyon kaa sambandh hota he
 When one oscillation of the oscillation system is complete, one or more teeth of these wheels blow
 is prakaar ye pahie dolanon kii gananaa karte hai
 These wheels are attached to the needles of the clock, which rotate on the dial and tell the time with the help of the time division marked on the dial
 ankaprishth ghanton, minuton or secondon main vibhakt rahata he
 The desired energy is obtained by the armament or load to keep the oscillator and calculator systems running continuously

 isi prakaar dolanvistaar yadi 3 inch se adhik badhaayaa jaay, to pratyak 0
1 inch vruddhi hone par ghadi ke samay main 1 second kaa antar aa jaataa he
 It is clear that due to changes in the length of oscillator due to change in temperature, there is often an error in the clock time

 In this way, this system calculates the oscillation, keeps the oscillation regular and controls the oscillation amplitude

 This system can be done in many ways, the following main being: isamen ek lungar a hota he jo centre k ke chaaron ore dolan karata he
 a oscillator from a hangs downwards
 dolak ke ardhadolan ke pashchaat pahiyaa pa kaa ek daant da lungar ke donon siron par lage paleton main se ek ko paar karata hota he
 In this way, he gives a slight push to the palette, which lifts the palette up and the other palette falls on his bottom wheel and gives him a slight shock in the back

 a small wheel rotated with a large wheel, which rotated another large wheel
 yah bada pahiyaa ek palaayan tantra se sambandhit tha, jo bhaar ke patan kii gati ko niyantrit karata tha
 The escape wheel was rotated at regular speed with the help of a oscillator
 dolak ke dahini ore se bain ore dolan ke saath palaayanchakr k ek daant aage badhata tha
 One of these wheels was attached to the hour, the second to the minute and the third to the second with the needle
 ye suiyaan ek ankaprishth par gumti thim
 The small wheel had six teeth and was related to the minute needle
 bade pahae main 72 daante the
 The hour hand was related to it
 is prakar jab chota pahiyaa 12 chakkar puraa karata tha tab bada pahiyaa ek chakkar ghumta tha
 In modern clocks, a small spring is used in place of weights and drums
 kamaani kas di jaati he
 The energy required to move the wheels is obtained by the gradual opening of this spring
 choti ghadiyon main dolak ke sthaan par santulanchakr laga hota he, jo daayen baayein ghurnan karata he
 To control this rotation, a cap is attached
 jab santulanchakr ek disha main gum jaataa he to keshakamani main anthan utpann ho jaati he, jo use pun: vipareet disha main waapas laakar ghurnan kii kriya karaati he
 To keep the clock moving continuously, Faulad's arch is again tightly wrapped after a fixed period, for which there is a key
 ghantadhvani utpann karanevaali ghadiyon tathaa nishchit samay par ghanti kii ghanghanaahat utpann karanevaali sachetak ghadiyon, athwa timopis, main ghantadhvani utpann karne kii pruthak vyavastha hoti he
 There is a bell inside the clock, on which the sound is produced when a hammer is hurt
 yah hathaudaa ek bhaar yaa kamaani se judaa rahata he, jo ise nishchit avadhi par chalaati he
 These watches are different from normal mechanical clocks only in that electric power is used to re-wrap their arches
 vidyut dwaara lapetane kii yah kriya yaa to lolak ke prayek dolan par, yaa nishchit avadhiyon ke antar par, hoti rahati he
 Smaller clocks can be run with the help of electrical batteries, and larger clocks are connected to the electric mains
 saral dhara main ta yah kaary kathin nahin hota, kintu prayavarti dhara jahaan hoti he vahaan vibhavaparivartak, yaa transfarmar, yaa telecron kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 By this, the alternating current is converted into direct current

 The sophisticated and exquisite forms of electric watches are clocks driven by the vibrations of pressure-electromagnets
 inamen sphatik ke manibh ko prayavarti dhara dwaara dolit karaayaa jaataa he or inhi dolanon ke dwaara ghadi chalati he
 In 1948, the Bureau of Standards of the United States of America, announced the design of atomic clocks
 ye ghadiyaan bhi daab-vidyut-manibhayukt saamaanya vidyut ghadiyon kii bhanti hoti hai
 The only difference is that their controlling frequency is provided by the self-oscillating-frequency of excited molecules or atoms instead of the alternating current
 ye aavritiyaan praaia: 1010 chakra prati second kii koti kii hoti hai
 Such atomic clocks are highly sensitive and accurate and do not get errors even up to 0
01 seconds in a year
 parmanviya ghadiyon main vaanchit anuspandan aavriti praapt karne ke liye abhi tak teen upayon par vichaar kiya gaya he: By the superstructure of the original state of the atomic cesium

 The oscillation of the crystal is just a few kilo-cycles
 use kisi aavritivardhak shrunkhlaa dwaara badhaakar atyant ucch aavritiwale sanketon main parivartit kar liya jaataa he
 This frequency is usually of the same order as the controlling frequency

 She was like a ray of light in the darkness, which the darkness repeatedly tried to bear

 Tukojirao Holkar was a confidant among Malharrao's siblings
 malharav ne unhen bhi sadaa apane saath main rakhaa tha or rajkaaj ke liye taiyaar kar liya tha
 Ahilyabai made him his commander and entrusted him with the task of recovering Chauth
 vaise to umr main tukojirao holkar ahilyabai se bade the, parantu tukoji unhen apni mata ke samaan hi maanate the or rajya kaa kaam puri lagan ore sachai ke saath karte the
 Ahilyabai had so much love and trust in her that she too considered him like a son
 rajya ke kaagazon main jahaan kahin unka ullekh aata he vahaan tathaa muharon main bhi 'khandoji sut tukoji holkar' is prakaar kaha gaya he
 The burden of state concern and disconnection of people dear to it
 is saare shok-bhaar ko ahilyabai kaa sharir adhik nahin sambhaal sakaa
 And on August 13, 1795, his life ended
 ahilyabai ke nidhan ke baad tukoji indaur kii gaddi par baitha
