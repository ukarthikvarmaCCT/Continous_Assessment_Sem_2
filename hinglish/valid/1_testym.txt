 This party works on the principle of liberalism and is commonly known as a center party in Canadian political circles

 The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history, holding power for almost 69 years in the 20th century — more than any other party in a developed country — and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's "natural governing party" 
 The party's signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, restoring balanced budgets in the 1990s, and making same-sex marriage legal nationwide
 During the beginning of the 21st century, the party lost a significant amount of support, to the benefit of both the Conservatives and the NDP
 In the 2011 federal election, the Liberals had the worst showing in its history, capturing only 19 percent of the popular vote and 34 seats—becoming the third-place party in the House of Commons for the first time
 In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau returned to prominence with its best showing since the 2000 election, winning 39
5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, thus regaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons
 The principles of this party, as the name suggests, are based on liberalism about which various liberal thinkers have written from time to time
 yah saamaajik udaarvaad ke liye vyaktigat swatantraaa, himmedaari, nyaaypurna samaajik vyavastha, raajnneetik va dharmik swatantraaa, rashtriya ekta, sambhaavnaaon va sansadhano main barabari, saanskrithik bahultawad, bahubhashi samaaj kaa samarthan karti he

 kaa paris commune ek krantikari andolan tha jiskaa pramukh mahatv france ke saamanshahi aadhipaty se paris ke sarvhaara varg dwaara apane ko swatantra karne ke prayatnon main he
 From the time of the commune of 1793 AD, revolutionary power was being nurtured in the proletariat of Paris, which at the time made fruitless efforts to use it
 2 sitambar san 1870 ko tritiy nepolian kii haar ke falswaroop utpann honevaali raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne paris or samantshahi france ke bich ke sangharsh or badha die
 On 4 September, the National Security Government was established with the declaration of the Republic, and only two weeks later the German army besieged Paris so that Paris was accepted by the Republic
 parantu maas par maas bitne par bhi jab gheraa na hataa tab bhukh or sheet se vyakul paris kii janata ne paris ke ekadhinaayakatv main levi aan maas kii charchaa prarambh kar di
 In September itself, the demand for the establishment of autonomous commune was sent to the new government
 idhar yuddh kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye nae sainya jatthon kaa sanghathan, shramikvarg ke logon kii bhartee tathaa unhen apane afasaron ko namjad karne ke adhikaar kii prapti ke falswaroop bhi paris ke sarvhaara varg kii shaktiyaan bad gai thim
 In February, 1871, these proletarian forces together formed a loose union and a central committee of national patrons based on three representatives from each of the 20 Arndismas
 28 janvari ko german sena tathaa rashtriya suraksha sarkaar ke bich kinchit kaal ke liye us uddeshy se yuddh sthagit karne kii sandhi hui ki france ko rashtriya sansad ke nirvachan kaa avasar praapt ho sake jo shantisthapana yaa yuddh ke chalate rahane par apana nirnay de
 But this parliament, representing the sentiments of feudal France, further enraged the proletariat
 usne mahange daamon main keval yudhsamapti ko hi nahin sweekaar kiya varan france kii rajdhani varasai main sthanantarit kar paris vaasiyon ko apamaanit bhi kiya or kuch aise prastaav paas kiye jo paris vaasiyon ke hiton ke liye ghaatak the
 In order to reduce the military powers of the National Guardian Committee with the intention of hurting the Autonomous Governance movement of Percis, the government's abortive attempt to gain control over its cannons on March 18, gave the fight between the two forms a revolutionary movement in which the government The military rejected the attack on the national patrons
 falat: sarkari paksh ke anek netaa maae gaye or shesh ne warsai main bhagkar sharan lee
 Thus, without any special struggle, the city came under the suzerainty of the National Guardian Committee, which immediately established an interim government and on March 26 arranged for the election of the representatives of the Paris Commune
 90 pratinidhiyon ke nirvachan ke liye lagbhag do lakh vyaktiyon ne matdaan kiya
 The National Conservative Committee retired from political work as it had finished its work as an interim government and thus finally the city of Paris was able to exercise its own governance in its own interest
 18 march kii kranti keval rashtriya suraksha sarkaar or usee sansad ke hi nahin varan kendrikaran kii us sampurna vyavastha ke viruddh thi jiske kaaran na keval sthaneey prabandh kendriya satta dwaara niyantrit tha, varan praanton dwaara aropit pratikriyaavaadi sarkaar ne paris tathaa anya bade nagaron kaa saamaajik or raajnneetik vikaas avaruddh kar rakhaa tha
 According to the revolutionaries, there was only one remedy to all this: minimizing the functions of the central authority so that local organizations could get the most possible powers not only for their management but also for the overall organization and development of their society; In other words, the conversion of France's autonomous communes into a union
 19 april ko prakashit paris commune ke ghoshnaptr ke anusaar commune ke adhikaar the-bajet paas karnaa; kar nishchit karnaa; sthaneey vyavsaay kaa nirdesan; police, shiksha evam nyaayalayon kaa sanghathan; commune kii sampatti kaa prabandh; sabhi adhikariyon kaa nirvachan, unpar niyantran tathaa unhen padchyut karnaa; vaiyaktik swatantraaa kii sthaayee suraksha; naagarik suraksha kaa sanghathan aadi
 From this point of view, this charter declares socialism which is the real basis of the entire movement
 commune siddhant purna se paris, liyon tathaa ek yaa do anya bade nagaron ke hiton kii drushti se pratipaadit kiya gaya tha or isliye france ke adhiktar bhaag main yah lagu nahin ho saktaa tha
 The idea behind this was that farmers of villages and residents of small towns are not yet qualified enough to make their own local arrangements
 isliye unhen vitt, police, shiksha tathaa samaanya saamaajik vikaas kaa uttardaayitv turant nahin saunpa ja saktaa
 It is clear from this that the dominance of Paris over France must have been the objective of at least a part of the revolutionaries; In the second commune theory, there was a contradiction from the beginning
 is siddhant ne paris tathaa anaru pragatisheel nagaron ko apragatik praanton ke niyantran se mukt kar unke liye sthaneey swaittashasan ghoshit kiya tha, parantu praant is siddhant ko, jaisaa swayan siddhant kii prastaavna main varnit he, sweekaar karne ke yogya pragatisheel na the
 As a result, he had to accept the subjection of Paris to join this movement
 dasure shabdon main, commune siddhant kii sthapana ke liye yah anivaary tha ki use pehle nasht kar diya jaae
 Jakoben appears once again in the disguise of independence and local autonomy is imposed by a central authority and the foundation of an independent union is laid on the basis of the force derived from the capital
 shashanprabandh ke liye commune kii parishad ne apane ko das aayogon main vibhakt kiya tha
 They were commissions - finance, war, public safety, foreign relations, education, justice, labor and regulation, food, public service, and general executive
 prarambh se hi commune ne samaajawaadee siddhant apnaane kii ghoshnaa kii thi; parantu vyavhaar rup main jis sarkaar kii praaia: sabhi shaktiyaan apane shatru ko nasht karne main hi pramukh rup se vyay hui hon uske liye, do maas kii choti avadhi main krantikari aarthik sanghathan kar paanaa asambhav tha
 The commune theoretically accepted local autonomy, but in practice its tendency was to impose the government of Paris on all France
 udaahranarth, april main paris commune ne swatantraaa ko francisi ganatantr kaa pratham siddhant maanakar or yah sweekaar kar ki dharmik maton kaa bajet is siddhant ke pratikul he kyonki vah nagarikon ko us dharmik vishwaas ke prachaar ke liye aarthik sahaayta dene ke liye baadhya karata he jo unka nahin he, tathaa yah vichaar kar ki pope swatantraaa ke adarsh ke viruddh rajtantr dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon main sahaayak hua he, yah ajyapti jari kii ki carch rajya se alag kar diya jaae or dharmik mathon kii sampatti raashtra kii sampatti ghoshit kar di jaae
 Therefore, although the Council of Commune of Paris accepted in principle only the interests of the Parisians, it issued a decree that applied to the Pope of all France in the name of independence
 commune ke alp jivan tathaa prashaskeey evam aarthik sudhaaron ko kaaryrup main parinat karne kii uski asafalataa kaa pramukh kaaran tha aise netaaon kii kami jo vibhinn tatwon ke paraspar sambhddha evam srujanaatmak kaaryakramon ko nirdhaarit kar saken
 In a short period of time, the inefficiency of the practical administration was revealed
 18 march kii kranti ke thik 64 din baad varasai ke sainya jatthe perasi main ghus pade
 On 22 October, after the fierce war, the Parliament of the commune was destroyed
 phir bhi 18 march kii is kranti ko tatkaaleen samaajawaadee sanghathanon ne samaajawaadee adarsh ke liye gai sarvhaara varg kii kranti ke rup main sweekaar kiya or is prakaar commune siddhant samaajawaadee darshan kaa ek ang ban gaya
 There is no doubt that the commune doctrine gave considerable amount in the promotion of class struggle and socialist ideology
 jis tatparta, veerta or balidaan kii bhaavana se paris commune ne videshi vijetaon or unase mili french deshadrohiyon se paris kii sadakon par 'bairicade' banaakar inch-inch jameen ke liye loha liya tha, vah swadeshraksha sambandhi yudhon main amar ho gaya he
 He established the first rule of proletarians in Paris, almost half a century before the Soviet state revolution
 par iskaa mulya use rakt se chukaana padaa
 If the anarchist thinker Bakounin found signs of his stateless federalism in the commune movement, then Pris Kropatkin called the revolution of 1871 a mass revolution and Marx chose it as the subject of one of his important texts for the expression of his communist ideas and the Russian leader, Lenin , Trotsky etc

 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini

 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed

 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom

 Scenic objects of Sarnath include Chaturmukh Singh pillar of Ashoka, ancient temple of Lord Buddha, Dhamek Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa, etc

 Madhvacharya was one of the most important philosophers of the time of the Bhakti movement in India
 ve purnaprajna va aanandathirth ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He was the originator of elementalism which is known as dualism
 dwaitvaad, veydant kii teen pramukh darshanon main ek he
 Madhvacharya is considered the third incarnation of Vayu
 madhwacharya kai arthon main apane samay ke agradoot the, ve kai baar prachlit ritiyon ke viruddh chale gayi hai
 He presented the dvaita philosophy
 inhone dwait darshan ke brahmasutra par bhashya likhaa or apane vedant ke vyaakhyaan kii taarkik pushti ke liye ek swatantra granth 'anuvyaakhyaan' bhi likhaa
 Commentaries on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads, the treatise on the Mahabharathataparyanryanay and the Shrimad Bhagwatpuran are his other treatises, explaining the meaning of the Mahabharata
 rugveda ke pehle chalis sookhton par bhi ek tikaa likhi or anek swatantra prakarnon main apane mat kaa pratipaadan kiya
 It seems that they are more dependent on the Puranas than the departed to support their views

 Traditional descriptions of Madhvacharya's biography and works are found in the texts Narayan Panditacharya, Sumadhvavijaya and Manimanjari
 parantu ye granth acharya ke prati lekhak ke shraddhalu hone ke kaaran atiranjana, chamatkaar or avishwasaneey ghatnaon se purna hai
 Therefore, on the basis of these, no precise details can be presented regarding Madhavacharya's life
 shri madhwacharya ne prasthaantrayee granthon se apane dwaitvaad siddhant kaa vikaas kiya
 It is also called 'sadvaishnav', because it is different from Sri Ramanujacharya's Sri Vaishnavism
 shri madhwacharya ne `'panch bhed' kaa adhyayan kiya jo `atyant bhed darshanam ́ bhi kaha jaataa he
 He has five characteristics: `atyant bhed darshanam ́ kaa vargeekaran padaarth rup main is prakaar bhi kiya gaya he : An independent is one who is completely independent
 jo bhagwaan yaa sanathan satya he
 But Jeevatma and Jagat are dependent on God
 isaliye bhagwaan unka niyantran karte hai
 God is independent
 isliye unka vargeekaran asambhav he
 Dependent elements are divided into positive and negative forms
 sakaaratmak ko bhi chetan or achetan main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Before defining the unconscious element, Madhvacharya talks about the independent and dependent who are eternally free from the world
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar `vishnu` swatantra hai jo viveki or sansar ke niyanta hai
 Her Shakti is Lakshmi who is eternally free
 kai vyuhon evam avtaron ke roopon main ham vishnu ko paa sakate hai 
 Similarly, the very dependent Lakshmi is also the power of Vishnu and can take many forms only for the physical body
 vah dukh-dard se pare hai
 His sons are Brahma and Vayu
 `prakruti ́ shabd pra = pare + kriti = sristi kaa sangam he
 Madhvacharya considered creation and Brahma separate
 unke anusaar vishnu bhautik sansar ke kaaran karta hai
 God empowers nature by Lakshmi and transforms her into a visible world

 Three powers emerge from the three aspects of nature: Lakshmi, Bhu and Durga
 avidya bhi prakruti kaa hi ek rup he jo paramatma ko jeevatma se chhipaati he
 Madhvacharya ji believes that the earth made of nature is not Maya, but is a separate truth from God
 yah doodh main chhipi dahi ke samaan parivartan nahin he, na hi paramatma kaa rup he
 Therefore, it is special dualism
 madhwacharya ji ne ramanujacharya kaa atmaaon kaa vargeekaran ko sweekaar kiya
 like :-- madhwacharya ne inke saath or do varg joda jo moksh ke yogya he or jo moksh ke yogya nahin he : According to this classification, the individual soul has a separate existence

 Which civilization dates back to 12th century BC
 Prior to the invasion of Greece by the Dorian Greeks and the adjacent islands, the seaside lands of Greece, its Mycenae central provinces and the historical Triad, it was developed and spread by archaeologists to name it 'aegean civilization'
 puratathvik anusandhanon or khudaayiyon se kriit, mikini or laghuesia ke traay nagar main jin khandhiron ke darshan hue hai ve misri, sumeri or saindhav sabhyataa ke samakaleen maane jate hai
 The civilization there was like that of those civilizations, Bronze Age, the predecessor of Iron Age
 in sabhi sthanon main prasaadon or bhawanon ke khandhar mili hai
 The oldest center of the Christian civilization and the capital of that state was Knossus, located on the northern coast of that island in the south of Greece
 knosus ke rajmahal ke bhagnavshesh se pragat he ki usamen samruddhi kaa nivas tha or usamen bhavy bhittichitron se alankrita bade bade haal or upree manjilon main jane ke liye chakkardaar sopanmarg the

 The beginning of the Aegean civilization BC It was probably some time before the start of the third millennium and its end was BC
 Around the middle of the second millennium

 Their Egyptians like Kativasan and the rest of the nakedness of the birds have estimated that they probably settled in the island of Crete from Egypt
 chitraksharon main likhe bhrant misri navik ke vrittant se bhi is anumaan kii aanshik pushti hoti he
 Those ancient inhabitants of Crete do not reflect any blood relations with the European white castes of the north
 pehle ijiaayiyon ne shuddh dhaatu, taanbe, aadi kaa upyog kiya, phir mishrit dhaatu kaanse kaa, jo taanbe or tin ke mishran se banataa tha
 This tin used to go from India where Bengal became famous by its Sanskrit name 'bang'
 vahiin se yah mishrit kaansa babul or misr bhi gaya tha
 The script was also used in the Aegean civilization, but like the Indian Sendhava script, it has not yet been read
 vah pard lee jaae to us sabhyataa kaa or bhi gaharaa rahasy khule
 The credit for the publication of this civilization goes to the fathers of archaeological science, Schliemann and Sir Arthur Evans

 Metals were used in abundance in the ancient and middle Minoi era
 kaanse or taanbe kii hi kataaren or talavaarein banati thim
 Life was of a high standard and metals were being used instead of clay to make utensils
 sone or chaandi ke bartan bhi khudaayiyon main mili hai
 Earthen utensils were made, but their physique was mostly made in imitation of metal utensils

 The last phase of the ancient Minoi era is characterized by stone corrugated objects

 Mainly marble or lime clay has been used in their construction

 The capital of the Minoi kings was in Knoosus, situated on the northern coast of Crete

 The palaces of Phaistas and Agia Triada are also believed to have been built by the kings of Knoosus

 The royal palace of Knossus has been built over neolithic ruins

 The vastness of the western entrance there and the galleries of Phaistas, which are made of stone, present an ideal in the progress of architecture in that ancient period
 knosus ke uttari or fistas ke dakshini rajmahal praaia: ek hi samay bane the
 On the southern coast of Crete are the ruins of the palaces of Phaistas and they also contain the ruins of the Rajprasad of the Agia Triada, though they were in the post-mino-era era

 The ruins as they are presented today with the efforts of archaeologists reveal that these palaces had extraordinarily large halls, curved steps, long chambers descending, and buildings enclosed by the outskirts — and then away, the Kriti civilization
 The civil expansion of the area went as far as the mountains of the west
 pradhan rajaprasaad apni ucchstareey jeevansuvidhaon ke saath atyant aadhunik lagata he

 Where the palaces of Asurabanipal are deserted and seem to be cold and inconvenient to winter, the Minoi Rajprasad is warm and comfortable and their painted walls seem to have filled their life with waves
 unke bhittichitron se pragat he ki knosus ke mehalon ke bheetar raja kaa darbar bharaa rahata tha or usamen nar or nari parichaarkon kii sankhya badi thi

 Both men and women used to participate in social life with equal rights and it appears that the dominance of women was more in the life of the palace and society
 isamen andeh nahin ki us pracheen jagat main kriit kii sabhyataa ne jitne adhikaar nari ko die, purush kaa samavarti jo sthaan use diya vah tab ke jivan main kahin or sambhav na tha
 In the frescoes, the skin of the woman is painted white and the blood of the man is painted, often according to the Egyptian tradition
 darbari dadhi munch mudaakar chehre saaf rakhte the or kesh lambey, jinhen ve naariyon kii hi bhanti veniyon main sajaa lete the
 Many times, it becomes difficult to identify girls among boys watching bulls and if their skin was not clear with the stereotypical colors, then the philosophy of both would be very similar

 The women kept their necks and arms covered, covered with necklaces, tightened the robes and lowered their skirts to the bottom of the gorge

 The appearance of men was different from them, very ordinary

 The men of Knossus also wore high sandals or boots in the legs, like the trenches of the bygone era

 As a result, when the invaders came from outside, the popular Minoan citizens could not answer their injuries successfully and had to surrender
 parantu vijetaon ko yah niskriy aatmasamarpan sweekaar na tha or unhone use nasht karke hi dam liya
 It is difficult to say who these invaders were
