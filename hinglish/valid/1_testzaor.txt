 In recent trials, single doses of rifampicin reduced the rate of leprosy development by 57% after two years of exposure to the disease; During this period, 265 treatments with rifampicin prevented a case of leprosy

 Attempts to address the permanent obstacles in the path of eradicating the disease include improving identity, educating patients and people about its causes, and the disease, whose patients have historically been "unclean" or "cursed by God" Assumed to have been excluded, it involves fighting social taboo

 Where taboos are strong, patients in those areas may be forced to hide their position, so that discrimination can be avoided
 Due to lack of awareness about Hansen's disease, people can believe that the disease is highly contagious and incurable
