 His reasoning was that the Indian forces occupying Kashmir were representing the British state and hence they could not fight it
 haalanki baad main pakistan ne senaayen bhej di par tab tak bharat kareeb kareeb do tihaayi kashmir par kabja kar chukaa tha This war was within the boundaries of the pre-jammu and Kashmir princely state, the Indian Army paramilitary force and the armies of the former Jammu and Kashmir princely state and the Pakistan Army paramilitary force and the tribal fighters of the North West Frontier State of Pakistan who called themselves as the Army of Azad Kashmir

 The tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir were busy in looting after the initial successes, and they proceeded to delay attacking the easily occupied new territories, and the Indian army was flown in as soon as the Maharaja agreed to merge with India
 With the help, he gave a chance to reach the soldiers
 1947 ke ant tak kashmir main kabja karne ke pakistani abhiyaan kii hawa nikal gayi

 vahaan pahunch kar unhone riyasat kii sena ko majboot kiya or srinagar ke chaaro ore rk suraksha gheraa banaaya or aaazaad kashmir sena ko haraa diya
 This security circle also included the rear-circling of the opponents by armored vehicles of the Indian Army

 He repulsed a counter-attack done on Tithwal
 poonch ghati main poonch main fasee bhartiya tukdi gheraabandi todakar kuch samay ke liye bahari duniya se waapas jud gayi
 For a long time, the contingent of the princely Kashmir state was still successful in protecting Skardu from Gilgit Scout, so the Pakistani army was not able to move towards Leh
 agast main chitral kii sena ne mata-ul-mulk ke netrutv main scardu par hamalaa kar diya or topakhane kii madad se scardu par kabja kar liya
 This led to Gilgit Scout going further towards Ladakh

 During this time the siege on Poonch continued
 ab bhartiya sena sabhi kshetron par pakistani sena or usase samarthit aaazaad kashmir sena par baari hone lagi thi
 Poonch was liberated from a year-long siege and the Indian army liberated Kargil by chasing him down after finally defeating him by the Gilgit Scout, who had been achieving good success so far, but the Indian Army was forced to attack further
 There could have been a problem of supply of logistics, so they had to stop the Pakistan Army was not expecting the tank to take the Zojila Pass with the help of tanks
 And have uprooted their feet immediately

 The use of armored vehicles and light tanks was very important in the two phases of this war, they were used in very small numbers in both
 ye charan the These incidents suggest that the attack of armored vehicles in unlikely places puts mental pressure on the enemy
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki hamalaavaron ne tagerodhi hathiyaaro kaa prayog nahin kiya shaayad unhone aavashyak na jaanakar unhe peeche hi chhod diya

 From the Household Cyclopedia of 1881 yah prakriya vasant ritu yaa garmiyon main sabase achche dhang se ho paati he, jab jameen sukhi hoti he
 The main drain should be made in each part of the area where a cross cut or open drain was formerly required; Their average depth should be four feet
 isse ye ghodon yaa maweshiyon dwaara ronde jane se hone vaali kshati se puri tarah se surakshit ho jaati hai or choti naaliyon se itani duuri par hone se unke liye baariki se pani saafe karti hai
 In every case, if possible, pipe turf is more preferable to the main drains
 agar acchhee kathor mitti ho to pipe turf kii ek pankti, yadi retili ho to pipe turf kii dohari pankti dena chahie
 If pipe turf is not easily found, a good wedge drain is a better option if the subsoil is strong, hard soil; But the subsoil is only marginally such that the Thorn drain, which has joints below it, will still prove to be better; And if the subsoil is very sandy, then it is useless to attempt to make drains below the surface in the field by any method other than pipes
 yahaan is baat kaa kaa ullekh karnaa aavashyak he ki lambaai or bahaav kii dhaal tathaa isamen pravaahit hone vaale pani kii maatra ke anusaar mukhya naalee kaa aakaar nirdhaarit kiya janaa chahie
 Although it is always safe to have large drains and large numbers, this is rarely done due to cost

 If the field has already been leveled then under no circumstances should they become hollow

 If the mounds are more than fifteen feet wide, no matter how wide or irregular, always follow the lines of the old beds as the best direction of the drain; And where a large number of mounds are assembled, a depth of twenty to twenty-four inches will be sufficient for pipe drains and twenty-four to thirty inches for wedge drains
 choti tathaa mukhya naaliyon ko aapas main jodne ke dauraan vishesh saavdhaanee barti jaani chahie, jisase pani ko mukhya naaliyon se ek badhamukt tathaa acchhee dhaal mil sake
 When the drains are finished, the dunes are broken by the plow and a second attempt may be made, where formerly they were extremely high, but it would be better not to over-level the dunes so that they Being able to live a little in its old state, where the drains are at the lowest level of the ground, the surface water collects up to the top of the drains and drowns in them freely
 Sector flows

 It is clear from the above method of drainage that the expenditure will vary according to the number of main drains in the field, the distance between small drains and the distance to be fixed on the field
 sataha se neeche naalee banane ke bahut adhik laabh hai, isse naa keval salanaa atyadhik maatra main pani kii surang banane kii laagat, cross kating ityadi kii bachat hoti he, balki bhoomi ko bhi suvidhanusaar garmiyon or sardiyon main jota or boyaa ja saktaa he, jo ki iske bina kaaphi avyavhaarya he; chhedon dwaara boi jane vaali fasalon kii prayek kism jaisi ki beans, aalu, shalgam ityadi kii safaltaapurvak kheti kii ja sakati he or hari tathaa safed fasalon kii prayek kism ke geele or apriy mausamon main kharaab hone kii kam sambhaavna he
 Wherever a water source of water appears from a particular place, the safest and effective way to get rid of this problem is to dig pits below the surface in which the falling water can be collected and in which the shower or water source To contain the amount of water released from it
 nikalne vaale pani kii maatra nirdhaarit karne, aavashyak staron ko note karne or muhane yaa pani dhone vaale maarg ko saafe karne ke baad us pramukh muhane ke bilkul paas nikasi shuru karen or tab tak kaam karen jab tak ki bauchhaar ke muhane tak na pahunch jaae, jisase shaayad apekshit vastu praapt hogi
 But if it is not completely exhausted, put as many branches in the main drain as necessary to stop the water in the middle and thus hardly feel frustrated

 Quickly filling the pits along with digging is very important because, if left open for a long time, not only will the surrounding soil fall into it but also its edges can become damaged or irregular, which will later be completely cured
 Can not be done
 Straw or soil containing soil should be applied over the material to avoid surface soil erosion and more attention needs to be paid to where wood is used for filler, otherwise the proposed improvements can be easily frustrating

 Wood producing trees have been planted since ancient times for decoration, educational or scientific purposes
 pracheen sahitya main vriksharopan or vrikshon kii dekhbhaal kii paryaapt charchaa hai
 Vedic culture is basically ashram culture and India is a hot country, hence the importance of tree plantation has been recognized since time immemorial and planting trees along roadsides is considered to be a formidable task
 paashchaatya jagat main sadakon kaa itihaas jab se aarambh hota he, uske shatabdiyon pehle se bhartiya yatriyon ko chaaya denevaali, shobhavali vrikshavliyon ke liye prasiddh thim
 The importance of plantation was less than that of a well, baoli, or inn by the side of roads
 vriksh sadak ke kinare praaia: donon ore, samanaantar evam lagaataar, panktiyon main, gole se kaaphi dur lagaae jate hai
 Often a single row is placed on both sides, but if there is a very wide strip on the side of the road, then two rows can also be placed there
 vrikshon ke bich aade-bende kam se kam chalis chalis foot kaa antar hona chahie, taaki vrikshon kii swasth vruddhi sambhav ho or unka purna vikaas hone par ek kii pattiyaan duusare se na chhu jaaen
 For some huge banyan trees, this difference may have to be kept even higher
 prayek dasha main sadak ke donon ore itani duuri honi chahie ki yadi ikharaa yaanpath ho to das-baarah foot or duhara yaanpath ho, to bees-choubees foot jagah sadak par bilkul khuli rah sake
 In this context, along with choosing suitable trees for local soil, it is also required that the trees should be low-enclosed
 sadak ke kinare kii bhusampatti kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana padataa he, jaise vishesh upjau bhoomi ho to aise ped lagane chahie ki unki chaaya se fasal ko vishesh haani na pahunche

 The work of making the basa is completed before the rain
 khudi hui mitti main aas paas uplabdh panttiyon evam gobar aadi kii khaad milakar, phir thale main is prakaar bhar di jaati he ki gaddha bhumital se lagbhag ek baalist nicha rahe
 Leave it to sit in the rain
 paudh kisi suvidhajanak sthaan par kyaariyon main hi taiyaar kii jaati he
 Here plants grow under the supervision of trained and experienced gardeners
 kyaariyaan aisi jagah banani chahie jahaan pani sadaa mil sake or pashuon se unki raksha kii ja sake
 It is also necessary to protect the plants from the harsh sunlight
 paudhe praaia: varsha main, yaa uske baad hi, lagaae jate hai, jab gadde geele hon or paudhe lagane ke liye thik hon
 Approximately six inches square and 12 inches deep pit is dug in the middle of the basin, selecting a plant with healthy and normal flooding
 phir usamen roj pani diya jaataa he, jabatak ki paudha jad na pakad le
 Gradually, some or all of its leaves fall off and new ones start coming out
 yadi danthal haraa he or usamen ankur nikal rahe hai, to paudha jivit samajhnaa chahie

 thaalon ke chaaron ore mitti, eent yaa lakdi ke ghere bana die jate hai, taaki jaanavar paudhe na char jaaen
 Depending on the plant and soil type, irrigation and weeding are required for about three to five years
 bade ho jane par paudhon par number daal die jate he
 a list of all the trees is made, which can be amended if any change is needed in future
 sadak ke kinare bahudhaa lagaae jane vaale ped aam, imali, jamun, bargad, pipal, neem, bakaayan, ashok, shisham, sagaun, mahua, nariyal or khajur aadi hai
 It is not good to plant prickly trees like acacia, because their dry thorns fall down and pedestrian and all the passengers suffer
 vrikshon kaa chunaav bahudhaa mitti kii drushti se kiya jaataa he
 Many types of diseases also occur in plants, in such a condition, treatment should be done soon
 kabhi kabhi pattiyon main neeche kii aare chote chote safed andey jaise athwa tahaniyon main fafoond jaisi lagi dikhaai detii hai
 They should be destroyed immediately and sprinkled with a mixture of lime water and blue light solution, or tobacco water, on the plants
 yadi turant is par dhyaan na diya gaya, to yah beemaari anya paudhon tak fail sakati he
 Sometimes germs are present in the soil or manure filled in the basins and spread from there to trees and sometimes from the adjacent vegetation
 maarg-vrikshpaalan kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he kaat chhant yaa shaakh taraashi
 If there are too many twigs or branches in the plant, then its flood stops
 shakhaon ke failaav se sadak ke upar yanon ke abaadh avaagaman main kathinaayee hoti he
 Therefore, with a sharp knife, scissors, or ax, all such unnecessary branches and twigs should be cut which seems clumsy, or obstruct the traffic

 If thin and bent stems cannot be replaced, they should be tied in a platter with a wooden stick, so that they gradually become straight
 yah sab kaam suvyavasthit dhang se, saavdhaanee purvak, kisi anbhavi vyakti kii dekh rekh main, upyukt mausam main kiya jaay, to atyant chittkarshak maarg taiyaar hota he
 The cost of plantation and rearing of trees varies according to local conditions
 yah mazdooree kii daron, pani kii uplabdhi, mitti kii kism or vriksh kii jati par bahut ansh tak nirbhar hota he
 If the expenditure on the way of tree farming is not recovered in the form of wood and fruits, then it is not wasted
