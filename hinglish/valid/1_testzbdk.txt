 It was common that Browning's grandmother was a Jamaican-born mulattu woman who inherited a plantation in St

 Thus Robert was raised in a house full of literary resources

 In 1845 Browning met Elizabeth Barrett, who lived as a semi-valid child in her father's house in Wimpole Street
 samay ke saath donon ke bich gahan prem ho gaya
 On 12 September 1846 they married in secret and ran away from home

 Since marriage, the young Browning couple have lived in Italy, first in Pisa and then in the same year at Casa Giddy, Florence in their new apartment
 
 unka iklauta putr, robert vieadman barat browning 1849 main paidaa hua
 He nicknamed him "panini" or "pan"
 It was only in these years that Browning had a profound influence on Italy's art and civilization and he learned a lot here
 In later years, he did not get tired saying that "italy was my university"
 Browning had also bought a house in the village of Asolo in the Veneto area near Venice, but ironically he died the day he received permission from the city council to purchase it
 unki patni kaa dehavsaan 1861 main hua
 Browning's poems knew the connoisseurs of literature from the very beginning, but as a commoner, he was able to become famous only in his middle years
 The poems Browning wrote in Florence were eventually published as a two-volume collection called Man and Woman
 Browning is known today as the author of these books, but when he appeared in 1865, his name was not even affected

 antat is sangrah ne browning ko vah khyaati dilaai jisaki talash unhen pichley chalis varshon se thi or jiske ve yogya the
 Robert Browning and Elizabeth kept their love and marriage secret
 Elizabeth, who was six years older and weaker than Browning, found it hard to believe that the beautiful and enthusiastic Browning really loved him as much as he says
 unhone apni kavita sonates from da porchugiz main apana yahi andeh vyakt kiya he
 He completed this poem in the next two years
 Eventually love overcame all doubts and troubles, and Browning and Elizabeth got married in St
 Marilbon Parish Church

 Their relationship as a husband and wife was satisfactory

 The work done in Browning's later years is being reviewed again
 apni kaavyatmak gunvattta or manovaigyanik antardrushti ke liye ye kaary pathakon main atyant lokapriy hai
 After a series of lengthy poems in the early 1870s, in which Fifine at the Fair and Red Cotton night-cap Country were most praised, Browning again began to write short poems
 In Pechiarotto and How He Worked in Distemper, Browning has a scathing attack against his critics, especially Poet Laureate Alfred Austin
 kuch reporton ke anusaar, browning kaa ladi eshbarton ke saath romance chalaa, parantu unhone doosraa vivaah nahin kiya
 In 1878, he returned to Italy for the first time in seventeen years after Elizabeth's death and thereafter came to Italy on several occasions
 unke kaam kii saraahna ke liye 1881 main browning socity kii sthapana kii gayi
 In 1887, Browning presented Parleinges with Certain People of Importance in Their Day, an important work of his later years
 is kaary main antat browning khud apni awaz main kuch bhulaae ja chuke kaviyon, darshanik itihaaskaaron or kalakaaron se samvaad karte hai
 Once again, the Victorian public became convinced by his reading
 iske baad browning phir se choti kavitaayen likhane lagen jo unke antim volum asolando main prakashit hui
 He died in Venice on 12 December 1889 at his son's home in c'argenico
 usee din asolando prakashit ho kar ai thi
 He is buried at Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey, where Alfred Tennison's tomb is also adjacent to him
 aaj browning kii khyaati mukhyatah unke naatakeey ekalapon kii vajah se he, jisamen shabd na keval paridrishy kaa varnan karte hai, balki vaktaa ke charitra ko bhi prakat karte hai
 These dramatic monologues of Browning are different from soliloquies
 inamen vaktaa pratyaksh rup se apana paksh nahin rakhata apitu paroksh rup main bina is prati prayaas kiye jo vah prakat kar jaataa he, vahi uskaa vaastavik dhyey hota he
 Through this, he justifies his activities in front of the veiled examiner contained in the poem
 apane paksh ko pratyaksh shabdon main kahe bina vah pathak ko apana paksh samajhan ko baadhya kar detaa he
 Browning introduces the most inane and psychopathic criminals in his poetry, which aims to create sympathy for the characters in the reader's mind
 Although those characters are not worthy of it, it is written to provoke the reader so that he is compelled to be considered innocent despite not wanting a killer and psychopath
 One of his more sensational monologues was Porphyria's Lover
 'maay last dches ' browning ke bahucharchit ekalapon main se ek he
 In this, the main character, Duke, is decent and noble, and his dialogues are also suited to an elite person
 parantu ek prabud va sachet pathak ko yah tathy spasht ho jaataa he ki is upree sabhyataa va sambhraant shabdon ke paroksh main ek veikshipt dimag kaam kar rahaa he
 Soon the reader learns that the Duchess was not murdered because of infidelity, nor because she was happy with the small incidents and in the end neither did she take proper gratitude for the position Could not reveal The Duke's arrogant and inhuman mind could not even accept that he had to ask his wife to behave like a duchess
 use yah bhi apni juthi shaan ke vipareet lagata tha
 Due to this pride, the Duchess became an artistic part of Duke's collection of paintings and mannequins
 In another monologue, Fra Lippo Lippy, Browning uses an uninteresting and immoral character and challenges readers to find out the characteristics of the character that even the judges of that time would be hard to find
 Ring and the Book is an epic Browning
 isamen ek hatya ke cese ke charitron dwaara bole gaye 12 rikt vars ekalapon ke madhyam se ve ishvar ke maanav ke prati prem kii vivechna karte hai
 These monologues greatly influenced many later poets, among whom T
S
 Elliot and Ezra Pound are prominent
 ejra pound to browning kii sordelo naamak kavita, jo teharaveen shatabdi ke ek asafal va niraash kavi kii vikrut maansikta kaa varnan he, ke vishay main apni kavita cantos main yahan tak kah daalaa ki browning ke is sangrah se itane prabhavit hai ki isse dur rahanaa kathin ho rahaa he
 It is worth noting that Browning's style which Victorian readers considered modern and experimental is actually influenced by the style of seventeenth-century poet John Dunn
 dan kavita ke aakasmik prarambh, aam bol chaal ke shabdon ke prayog or aniyamit lay taal ke liye prasiddh the
 Browning was a descending admirer of Percy Shelley, and so he abstained from the false conceit, sarcasm and inappropriate word-of-war used by self-centered poets of the seventeenth century
 He has modern sensibilities and is in that innocent statement of one of his characters' God in heaven; All is well on earth " ke viruddh uthne vaale prashnon se bhalee bhaanti avgat hai
 Browning supports this statement because he believes that that almighty God, despite living in that transcendent paradise, is not far from worldly processes and has abundant opportunities and reasons for joy in life

 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the Norman Conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, for which Norman vocabulary and spelling rules were heavily used
 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language
 angreji bhashaa kaa kaam chalau gyaan anek kshetron, jaise kii chikitsa or computer, ke liye ek aavashyaktaa ban chukaa he; parinamswaroop ek arab se zyada log kam se kam buniyadi str kii angreji bol lete hai 
 yah sanyukt rashtraki chah aadhikarik bhashaaon main se bhi ek he
 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands
 in jarmenic janajatiyon main se ek thi engles, jo sambhawatah angton se aaye the
 Bead has written that his entire country, except his old land, had come to Britain

 Anglo Saxons began invading Denmark and Jutland in 449 AD, before their arrival the locals of England spoke Brythonic, a Celtic language

 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain

 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world

 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date

 In 1066, the Duke of Normandy invaded England and conquered the anglo-saxon tribes here

 This period of English continued from 1100 to 1500 and this period of English expansion is called medieval English

 Chaucer's poetry in English literature is said to be an important example of this language

 With the increasing influence of America in world politics, literature, business etc

 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots

 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge

 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English

 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker

 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable

 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "point of view" and a rising voice means "point of view"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he

, many animal names and many common Activities jarmenic shabd angreji ke latin shabdon se zyada chote hote hai or saamaanya bolchaal main inkaa upyog zyada aam he
 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface

 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English

 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 Several grades of alloys, such as aluminum and super alloys that are hardened by precipitation, are tempered to precipitation of intermittent particles, making the metal much stronger
 tempring ke liye padaarth ko iske nimna jatil taapmaana se kam taap par niyantrit rup se punah garm kiya jaataa he
 The brittle martensite becomes more rigid and flexible after tempering
 carbon parmaanuon ko jab teji se thanda kiya jaataa he, ve ostentine main funs jate hai, aamtaur par tel yaa pani ke saath martensit banaate hai
 The martensite becomes stronger after tempering because when it is reheated, its microstructure is rearranged and the carbon atoms diffuse out of the distorted karya-centered-tetragonal structure), due to diffusion of carbon
 Subsequently, the resulting structure is almost pure ferrit, consisting of a work-centered structure
 dhaatu vigyaan main, hameshaa majbootee or lacheelepan par bal diya jaataa he
 This delicate balance highlights the many nuances inherent in the process of tempering

 260–370 ° c Tempering is sometimes not done in the k range, this helps to reduce the brittleness caused by tempering

 ye punjab se hai
 a command or 'injunction' is an order which the court shall, under its parity rights, to do something in the name of a party or corporation, to do any work, to stop it from doing any work or to continue to do such work Issues that he is obliged to do or not to do
 nyaayalay kaa yah aadesh vyakti par vyaktigat rup se lagu hota he is aadesh kaa ulanghan nyaayalay kii manahani mana jaataa he
 If a person defames in this manner, then there is a system of confiscating his property
 bhartiya vidhaan ke antargat jin maamalon main vyakti ko sajaa dena yaa sampatti jabt karnaa prabhavakaari na ho, un maamalon main civil procidyur code aadesh 21 niyam 32 ke anusaar nyaayalay decri paanevaale vaa kisi anya kisi vyakti ko nirdhaarit kaam sampadan karne kaa aadesh de saktaa he
 In this situation, the entire expenditure of performing the said work will have to be borne by the person who was originally ordered to complete the said work
 samadesh sweekaaratmak bhi ho sakati he or nishedhaatmak bhi
 By the admissible or injunctive orders, the defendant is ordered to do something which he is legally bound to do
 nishedhaatmak vaa nirodhak samadesh ke dwaara prativaadee ko kisi kaam ko karne se yaa kisi sthiti ko banaaye rakhane se nivrutt hone kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 The division of the command into an acceptable or injunctive form depends on the nature of the work in relation to which a judicial instruction is issued
 samadesh ke pun: do vibhaag kiye gaye hai- antarvarti or sthaayee
 This method is divided keeping in mind two things - one is the duration of the order and secondly, at what stage of the judicial process the order is issued
 mote taur par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki antarvarti aadesh vah he jo maamle kii sunwaayee puri hone tak ke liye prabhavakaari hota he
 The permanent injunction is issued after the completion of the case
 sthaayee samadesh jari karne kaa arth he prativaadee ko sadaa ke liye kisi aise adhikaar se vanchit kar dena yaa koi aisa kaam karne se roak dena jo vaadi ke adhikaron ke virodh main ho
 In case of great need, a unilateral command can also be issued only on the application of the plaintiff without taking the statement of the defendant
 kintu is dhang se jari kii gai ekapaksheeya samadesh tab tak asthaayee hi rahegi jab tak ki prativaadee soochnanusaar apana bayaan dene ke liye prastut nahin ho jaataa
 Most of the judicial remedies which are presently in Indian courts, if not all of them, were taken from the English judicial system
 19veen shatabdi ke madhya main ukt nyaayapaddati se sambandhit do tarah ke nyaayalay or doosraa samya nyaayalay samya nyaayalay ko hi chanceri kaa nyaayalay bhi kaha jaataa tha
 The Courts of General Legislature were the general courts of the state
 in nyaayalayon main nyaayavyavastha desh ke pracheen ritirivaajon par aadhaarit hoti thi
 Only those ancient customs were called general justice
 saamaanya yaa samta ke nyaayalay main rahati thi
 It can be said broadly that the flaws in the general justice were clear in the judicial system based on the principle of equity
 saamaanya nyaay ke anusaar sabhi prakaar kii kshatiyon kii purti dravya dwaara kar di jaati thi
 Let a have an acre of land which is mixed with the land of 'B' and 'A' contracts with 'B' to the effect that he will give it to 'B' after six months from the date of the agreement
 Will sell and transfer
 tab is pratham qaraar ke ek maheene ke baad 'k' yadi vah bhoomi ek tritiy vyakti 'ga' ke haath bech detaa he to is sthiti main saamaanya kanoon qaraar todane se hui kshati kii purti ke liye keval dravya die jane kaa aadesh de saktaa tha
 On the other hand, in such a situation, the court of equity could not only stop 'A' by issuing the order that he should not sell the land to 'C' but could also make specific instructions that the said land at the appropriate time
 But 'b' should be sold and transferred
 isse spasht ho jaataa he ki saamaanya vidhaan ke is dhang ke dosha ko dur karne kii kitni aavashyaktaa thi
 At the same time, it also shows the extent of jurisdiction of equality justice
 jin sthitiyon main aarthik pratifal samaan rup se upyogi he, un sthitiyon main samta ke antargat vishesh upachaaron kaa prayog nahin kiya jayega
 But if there is a violation of the trust or other such right and the general legislation does not recognize the breach of the said right, then in that case there is a system of special remedies under Samay
 yah siddhant tathaa isse sambandhit upasiddhant samadesh sambandhi kanoon ke kshetra main sarvatra paae jaayenge
 The system of issuing orders, along with many other remedies, has also been brought from England to India through various edicts of the High Courts of India

 Some of the process related matters have been discussed in the Civil Procedure Code of India
 yadi prativaadee vaadi ke sampatti sambandhi adhikaron kaa hanan karata he yaa vaadi ko sampatti ke upbhog se vanchitakarta he yaa is dhang kaa kaam karne kii dhamkee detaa he to nyaayalay neeche likhi sthitiyon main prativaadee ke naam sthaayee samadesh jari kar saktaa he- yadi prativaadee vaadi ke liye sampatti kaa nyaasi ho yaa jab yah jaanane kaa koi saadhan na ho ki prativaadee dwaara vaadi ke sampatti sambandhi adhikaron kaa hanan kiye jane se vastut: kitni kshati hui he, yaa jahaan kshati is dhang kii ho ki uski dravya dwaara pootin se paryaapt avamukti sambhav na ho sake, yaa jahaan is baat kii sambhaavna ho ki kshati kii dravya dwaara purti saadhy nahin he, yaa jahaan nyaayik prakriya ke vistaar ko rokane ke liye samadesh jari karnaa aavashyak ho gaya ho
 The MLA cannot stop any person from making orders to the organization, the command cannot interfere in the relevant work to be done by any department of the government, the command cannot interfere in the state related functions of any foreign government, in matters of crime
 Hearing also cannot be stopped by the command nor can anyone be prevented from breaking such agreement by the command For which he is not particularly committed to subsistence
 yadi praarthi apni anumati se yaa apane kisi vyavhaar se apane aap ko samadesh kaa anadhikari bana detaa he, us sthiti main us vyakti ke paksh main samadesh jari nahin kii jaaegi
 Normally, a government department cannot be prevented from performing its duties, but this does not mean that Indian courts cannot prevent the government or any department of the government from doing or continuing to do illegal work
 kabhi kabhi kisi qaraar ke nirvaah ke liye samadesh aavashyak ho jaati he
 But in such a situation it is necessary that a particular subsistence of that agreement is possible
 vyaktigat seva ke qaraar main isse kuch kathinaayee paidaa ho gai he
 In general, personal services agreements are not typically forcibly implemented

 ant main san 1561 i

 Then Rupmati became Adam Khan's prisoner
 uske rup or sangeet se mugdh aadam khan ne jab rupamati ko apni preyasi bananaa chaha tab rupamati ne vish khaakar bajbahadur ke naam par jaan de di or apni premakahani ko amar kar diya
 Many songs and verses composed by Roopmati have been popular in the masses since then and have been sung as folk songs in many parts of Malwa till now
