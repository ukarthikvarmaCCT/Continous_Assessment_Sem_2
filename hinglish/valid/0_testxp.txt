 Indian percussion, two drums of leather pakhaawaj, mrudang, khol, dholak, nagaada, bongo Tabla is a rhythm used in Indian music which is very popular mainly in South Asian countries
 yah lakdi ke do urdhvamukhi, belanaakaar, chamada madhe munh vaale hisson ke rup main hota he, jinhen rakh kar bajaaye jane kii parampara ke anusaar "daayan" or "bayen" kehete hai
 This rhythm is very important in Hindustani classical music and has been used almost inevitably in classical and sub-classical singing since the eighteenth century
 iske atirikt sugam sangeet or hindi cinema main bhi iskaa prayog pramukhataa se hua he
 This Baja is practiced in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka
 pehle yah gayan-vaadan-nrity ityadi main taal dene ke liye sahyogi vaadya ke rup main hi bajaay jaataa tha, parantu baad main kai tabalaa vaadakon ne ise ekal vaadan kaa madhyam banaaya or kaaphi prasiddhi bhi arjeet kii
 The origin of the name Tabla is traced to the word "tabl" of arabic-persian origin
 haalaanki, is vaadya kii vaastavik utpatti vivaadit he - jahaan kuch vidvan ise ek pracheen bhartiya parampara main hi urdhvak aalingyak vaadyon kaa viksit rup maanate hai vahiin kuch isaki utpatti baad main pakhaawaj se nirmit maanate hai or kuch log isaki utpatti kaa sthaan pachhimi asia bhi bataate hai
 The history of the tabla is accurately known and there are many subscriptions about its origin
 isaki utpatti ke sambandh main varnit vichaaron ko do samoohon main baanta ja saktaa he: During colonial rule, the hypothesis was very forcefully introduced that the tabla originated from a couple drums plying with Muslim armies; The origin of this establishment is based on the Arabic word "tabl" which means "drum"
 babar dwaara sena ke saath aise drum lekar chalane ko udhaaharan ke rup main prastut kiya jaataa he, haalaanki turk senaaon ke saath chalane vaale ye vaadyayantra table se koi samanta nahin rakhte balki "nakkaara" se samanta rakhte hai
 According to the second establishment, in the time of Alauddin Khilji, Amir Khusrau is said to have cut the "awaaz Baja" into a tabla
 haalaanki, yah bhi sambhav nahin lagata kyonki us samay ke koi bhi chitra is tarah ke kisi vaadya yantra kaa nirupan nahin karte
 Muslim historians have also not mentioned any such instrument in their descriptions
 udhaaharan ke liye, abul faiji ne in-e-akabari main tatkaaleen vaadyayantron kii lambii suchi ginai he, lekin isamen table kaa zikr nahin he
 Another third opinion is that Amir Khusro, a disciple of Delhi-based noted singer Sadrang and son of the famous Pakhawaj player Rahman Khan, invented tabla in 1738 AD from Pakhawaj
 isse pehle khyaal gayan main bhi pakhaawaj se sangat kii jaati thi
 This theory has potential because the miniature artifacts of the time have evidence of a musical instrument similar to the tabla
 haalaanki, isse yah prathit hota he kii is vaadyayantra kii utpatti bhartiya upmahadeep ke muslim samudaayon main dilli ke aasapaas hui na ki yah arab deshon se aaayaatit vaadyayantra he
 Musicologists such as Neil Sorrel and Pandit Ram Narayan do not see much truth in the legend of the pakhawaj cutting and making tabla
 bhartiya utpatti ke siddhant ko maanane vaale table kaa mul bharat main maanate hai or yah kehete hai ki muslim kaal main isane maatr arabi naam grahan kar liya
 Bharata Muni, the pioneer of Indian Natyashastra, is said to describe the up-temporal musical instruments
 aise hi, haath main lekar bajaaye jane vaale "pushkar" naamak talwadyon se table kii utpatti bataayi jaati he
 Evidence of the "pushkar" instrument is found in the sixth-seventh century temple engravings, especially in the Mukteshwar and Bhubaneswar temples
 in kalakritiyon main vadak kalakaar do yaa teen alag-alag rakhe talwadyon ko saamne rakh kar baithe dikhaae gaye hai or unke haathon or ungliyon ke nirupan se ve inhen bajaate hue prathit hote hai
 However, these representations do not show that these instruments are made from the same material and are as tanned as modern times
 tabalaa aaj jin padaarthon se or jis rup main banaaya jaataa he, aise vaadyayantron ke nirmaan ke likhit pramaan sanskrit granthon main uplabdh hai
 "tabla" - the oldest information related to the construction of instruments is found in Sanskrit Natya Shastra
 in talwadyon ko bajaane se sambandhit vivaran bhi naatyashaastra main milti he
 At the same time, the South Indian treatise, for example, Shilappadikaram, whose composition is believed to be of the first century AD, gives details of about thirty tala vadis, some of which are tightened by ropes and others, but does not contain an instrument called "tabla"
 is
 taal or talwadyon kaa varnan vaidic sahitya se hi milanaa shuru ho jaataa he
 With two or three limbs, hanging with cords, the hand-played instrument "pushkar" has evidence of being in the fifth century which were counted in other rhythms with mridang, however, they were not called tabla
 used to go
 paanchavin sadi se purv kii ajanta gufaaon ke bhitti-chitra jameen par rakh kar bajaaye jane vaale urdhvamukhi drumon kaa nirupan karte hai
 a similar representation of artists playing the rhythm of the sit is found in the stone sculptures of Ellora, and also from other places
 pehali sadi ke chini-tibeti yatriyon dwaara bhi bharat main chote aakaar ke urdhvamukhi drumon kaa prachlan hone kaa vivaran praapt hota he 
 Jain and Buddhist texts such as Samvayasutra, Lalitvistara and Sutralankara etc
 also find details of this rhythm called Pushkar
 kai hindu or jain mandir, jaise kii rajasthan ke jaipur sthit eklingaji mandir, table jaise aakaar ke vaadya bajaate hue vyakti kaa prastar murtiyon main nirupan karte hai
 In the south, there is evidence of small rhythms like IS even during the time of Yadav rule when Sarangadeva was composing the music Ratnakar
 haalia bimbashastreey daawey jinamein table ko 1799 ke aasapaas kaa mana gaya he ab mahatvaheen ho chuki hai or bhaaje gufaaon se praapt chitra pracheen bharat main is tarah ke vaadya kaa prayog pramanit karte hai
 Evidence of upward-facing instruments on the ground has been obtained from several Hindu temples dating back to around 500 BCE
 dakshin bharat main istarah ke vaadyon ke maujuud hone ke pramaan ke rup main hoyasaleshwar mandir, karnatakam kaa udhaaharan liya ja saktaa he jisamen ek nakkashi main nrity samaaroh main ek stri table jaise vaadya bajaati dikhaai gayi he
 The tabla differs from the mridang and pakhavaj on the basis of the art of playing
 isamen haath kii ungaliyon kii kalatmak gati kaa mahatv adhik he
 At the same time, pakhawaj and mridang are played at the speed of the claw as they are hit horizontally and thus complexity in their speech is not as much as in the tabla
 atah dhvanishastreey or vaadan kala aadhaarit adhyayanon main table kii samanta teenon vaadyon ke saath sthapit kii ja sakati he; pakhaawaj kii tarah kaa "daayan", nakkaare kii tarah aakaar vaala "bayen", dholak kii tarah gamak vaala prayog, teenon praapt hote hai
 The "tabla" has two parts, that is, it consists of two drums whose size and shape are somewhat different from each other
 takneekee taur par, ek sidhe haath vaale vadak dwaara, daahine haath se bajaay jane vaala ang hi tabalaa kehalaata he
 In common language, it is called right or right
 yah lagbhag 15 centimetre vyas vaala or 25 centimetre oonchaai vaala hota he
 The left side is also called Dagga, Duggi or Dhama according to the region
 puraane praapt chitron main daahine or baayen ang kaa aakaar lagbhag samaan paaya gaya he or kabhi kabhi baayen kaa aakar chota bhi
 However, now the size of the left is much larger than that of the tabla
 dahinaa yaa tabalaa bahudhaa lakdi kaa bana hota he jabaki bayen mitti kaa bhi hota he athwa donon hi pital yaa phool ke bhi bane ho sakate hai
 The left is a wide-mouthed, leather-plated drum with a size of about 20 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height
 daahine main doriyon ke bich lakdi ke chote aade belan belan lage hote hai, jinpar hathaudi se chot kar doriyon ke kasaav ko badla ja saktaa he
 This action is called melody
 gayan-vaadan ke dauraan raag ke mukhya swar "sa" ke saath table kii dhwani kii tikshnata kaa milan kiya jaataa he, jise table ko "shadj" par milaanaa kehete hai
 As with the sitar, as the string is instrumental and of high sharpness, the tabla is also mixed on the "fifth"
 baayen ko saamanytah, table kii tulana main nichle swaron "mandra pancham" par sur main rakhaa jaataa he
 Artists can also make slight changes to the left notes by applying pressure on the back of their palm
 in donon angon ke aakaar main vishmata ke kaaran tikhe or chanchal bol - ta, tin, naa ityadi daahine par bajaaye jate hai or baayen kaa aakaar bada hone ke kaaran gambhir aawaaj vaale naad dhe, dhig ityadi baayen par bajte hai
 That's why "left" is used as a "base drum"
 tabalon ke chamada madhe mukh par bhi teen hisse hote hai: The part that forms a black rash in the middle of each part of the tabla is called "ink"
 yah mukhya rup se chaaval yaa gehun ke mand main kai prakaar kii chije mila kar banaaya gaya ek lep hota he jo suukh kar kadaa ho jane ke baad table ke chamade kii swaabhaavik dhawani kaa parishkar karke ise ek khanakdaar awaz pradaan karata he
 Proper use of ink during the tabla manufacturing process is a skill and the quality of this instrument is largely dependent on the efficiency of ink implantation
 kuch vadak, duggi par siyaahi ke bajaay, goondhe gaye aate ko chipka kar sukha lete hai, haalaanki yah prakriya har baar kerani padati he or tabalaa vaadan ke baad ise khurch kar hataa diya jaataa he
 In Punjab it is still in vogue and such "left" is called "dhama"
 table ke bolon ko "shabd", "akshar" yaa "varna" bhi kehete hai
 These lyrics have not been traditionally written but have been taught in oral form in the guru-shishya tradition

 Phosphate minerals are a large and diverse group of minerals
 kintu inamen se kuch khanij varg hi adhik paae jate hai
 Some mineral phosphates are given below: prithvi kii sataha main 0
11% phosphate tatv vidyaman he
 It is in the form of compounds of many metals or elements
 praaia: 150 se adhik aise khanij gyaat hai jinamein ek pratishat yaa adhik phosphorus pentaxide ke rup main vartmaan he
 But most of the phosphorus of the Earth's surface belongs to the same mineral lineage, which belongs to the apatite group
 is samooh kaa rasinic sutara he
 Compounds of this type of metals and phosphorus are often called mineral phosphate
 in khanij phospheton ko shail phosphate athwa phospheti shail ke naam se bhi saamaanya rup main abhihit kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes it is called phosphorite rather than apatite or shell phosphate
 vastav main ye teenon namakaran ek hi khanij ke liye prayukt hote hai, jo chooney kii chattaanon ke saath calosium phosphate kii grathiyon ke atyant thos padaarth ke rup main prithvi kii sataha par yaa neeche paae jate hai
 It was previously believed that the amount of phosphate present in it remains as trichellium phosphate, but by early studies it has been proven that the phyto-rock formations are predominantly present in all types of phosphate rocks
 mitti main paae janevaale phospheton ke strot ye hi shail phosphate hai
 In addition, they are also found in the ocean floor
 aisa vishwaas he ki samudr ke jal se hi sansar ke bade se bade phosphate bhandaron kii utpatti hui he, kyonki ye bhandar pratyaksh avakshepan athwa chidiyon kii beet, yaa samudr main rahanevaale praaniyon dwaara sangruhit phosphorus ke parinamswaroop bane hai
 Five varieties of apatite are known that result from the substitution of some fluoride, chloride, hydroxide, carbonate, or sulfate in place of phosphate
 inke naam hai floor, chlor, hydroxi, carbonate tathaa sulphato-epetic
 Due to the presence of fluorine, the spherical rocks are extremely insoluble in water and that is why they are coming from ages
 kuch mitti main titanium, aluminium tathaa louh phosphate bhi paae jate hai, jo jal main aviley hai
 Magnesium, manganese, strontium, lead, sodium, uranium, cerium and other elements along with calcium in apatite can give rise to Nana Prakr's compounds by substitution
 yahi nahi, phosphate kaa bhi pratisthaapan vanedet, arsenet, silicket, sulphate, carbonate or akselette dwaara ho saktaa he
 Appetite can be found in nature in six ways: iske atirikt pracheen, asthiyon ke aagaar or phospheti louh-ayask athwa kshareey dhaatumal bhi mahatvapurn strot hai
 These mineral phosphates are found more in the following countries in chronological order: sanyukt rajya america,, uttari africa, soviet sangh, prashanth mahaasaagar tathaa hind mahaasaagar ke dweep tathaa austrailia, japan, newjiland, belgium, france or england
 The estimated worldwide quantity of phosphatic rock and apatite will be 96,38,11,29,000 tonnes, of which India has only 1,01,28,000 tonnes
 spasht he ki bharat jaise vishaal desh ke liye yah maatra paryaapt nahin, kintu phir bhi is desh kii krishi kii unnati ke liye itani hi maatra mahatvapurn he
 So far, phosphate is excavated at only two places in India
 trichanapalli ke aasapaas jo phosphate granthiyaan hai unamem 20-30% phosphorus-pentoxide vartmaan he or anumaanit sangrah 20 lakh ton hoga jab ki bihar main singhbhumi ke paas paae janevaale sangrah main 15-20% hi phosphorus pentoxide he or anumaanit sangrah 7 lakh ton hoga
 Sodium, magnesium, and carbonate are present in the bones, in addition to tricalcium phosphate
 kachi asthiyon main 2-4% nitrogen, tathaa 22-25% phosphorus pentaxide hota he
 The achievement of phosphates in the bones can be increased by boiling them
 bharat main sabhi uplabdh sroton se prativarsh 4-5 lakh ton kachi asthiyaan pashuon se praapt kii ja sakati hai, kintu prativarsh 1 1 / 2 lakh ton se adhik kaa ekatrikaran nahin ho paata
 In India in the year 1957, 30-35 thousand tons of bone powder was put in the fields as manure
 dhaatumal kaa nirmaan ispaat udyogon main upjaat ke rup main hota he
 Iron ores have little phosphorus present as impurities
 inkaa nishkasana ispaat kii koti unnat karne ke liye aavashyak hota he
 If more than 2% of phosphorus remains in steel, it becomes fissile, so in 1877, Tomas and Gilchrist combined a new method of steel making in which iron impurities — calcium, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus — into lime-converter By heating, these impurities were removed as a lime complex
 yahi dhaatumal ke naam se vikhyath he
 It has phosphorus pentoxide current ranging from 7-8% to 17-20%
 is prakaar se lakhon ton dhaatumal germany, england tathaa france main taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 It is designated as Tomas Phosphate, Cinder, Phosphate, Gandhavihin Phosphate or sometimes Iron Phosphate
 krishakon ke liye yah sasta evam upyogi phosphate urvarak he
 With the advancement of steel industry in India, there is also a possibility of increase in the production of clinker

 Mineral phosphates are most commonly used in the manufacture of phosphate fertilizers
 phospheti chattan ko churna karke salphurik amla se abhikrut karne par superphosphate banataa he
 This substance is highly used as fertilizer
 saadhaaran phospheti chattan ke churna main 30-40% phosphorus pentoxide, 3-4% fluorine tathaa bhinn matraaon main chuunaa rahata he
 Due to the presence of fluorine, phosphate of rocks is not available to the plants
 amlon kii abhikriya se inke phospheton ko uplabdh banaaya jaataa he
 In these acids, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid are used predominantly
 bharatvarsh main san 1957 main kareeb 1 1 / 1 lakh ton superphosphate kaa vitaran hua
 Phosphoric acid is also obtained from phosphatic rocks, which works to make tri-phosphate of low-grade phosphatic rocks
 aise phospheton main phosphorus kii maatra adhik hone ke kaaran kisaanon ko kam maatra main urvarak daalana padataa he
 For the suitability of phosphate fertilizers, it is necessary that their phosphorus is in soluble state
 phospheti chattan ko churna karke kheton main phosphorus urvarak ke rup main kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 If this powder is left in the soil with organic materials, then plants may get more phosphorus
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki carbonic padaartho se carbon diaksaide banataa he, jo pani main ghulkar avilesh phosphate ko viley banaata he
 Alkaline clinker phosphate is also made available in this way
 iske churna ko daalane se ghaason evam jadonvaali fasalon ko vishesh laabh pahunchataa he
 Phosphate fertilizers are highly needed in acidic soils
 compost banane main bhi churna phospheti chattaanon kaa upyog hota he
 Powder phosphatic rock in the US and clinker in England have been used successfully as fertilizers
 is prakaar ke phospheti urvarkon ke upyog se annotpaadan main vruddhi hoti he

 iske turant baad, unke bete ne lottery tikat kharida or 21,00,000 rupee jite
 After getting seduced by her aunt and embarrassed by inequality, Ganga reached Poonam's house and demanded her son back
 punam bheekh maangti he lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 Sharad leaves the boy with Ganga and comes home
 baad main, jab vijay kisi daure se lautataa he, to usne paaya ki sharad or punam ne apane bangale ko khaali kar diya he or ek chote se ghar main sthanantarit ho gaye hai or apane bachche ke nuksaan par dukhi hai
 Vijay comes to the house of Ganga, who now lives a better life with lottery money
 vah gussa hota he or uskaa parityag kar detaa he or apane bacchon ko uske saath chhod detaa he
 He goes straight to Sharad's residence and apologizes for his wife's mistakes
 is bich, aparaadh bodh main ganga apane ko maarane kii koshish karti he or behosh ho jaati he
 Sharad and Poonam arrive at the house and soon bring them back to consciousness
 vijay apni galati ko samajhataa he or uski maafee sweekaar karata he or phir ve sabhi ek saath khushi se rahete hai
