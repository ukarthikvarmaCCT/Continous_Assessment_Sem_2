1 main he
 Then verse 5
2 explains this
 sarveshwaravaadi kutchyna stotra kahata he ki hamaari aatma brahman he or yah param satya yaa ishwar sabhi praaniyon ke bheetar maujuud he

2 main vishnu or shiv kii tulana gun kii sankalpana se kii gai he
 It states that the qualities, psyche and innate tendencies described in the text occur in all beings

 uskaa wo bhaag jo rajas he, he pavitra gyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon, brahma he
 The part of it that is Sattva is Vishnu, the students of sacred knowledge

 The Bhagavata Purana states that after this he created a variety of dazzling creatures by combining nature and man
 bhagwat puraana maaya ke srijan ko bhi brahma kaa kaam bataata he
 He created it only for creation
 maaya se sab kuch achchhai or buraai, padaarth or aadhyatm, aarambh or ant se rang gaya

 vaishnavi andolan ne prantiy sahitya ko bal diya
 Shankar Dev kept this movement alive in his long life-journey with lyrical poetry, drama and songs
 asamiya ke shisht or likhit sahitya kaa itihaas paanch kaalon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he: Hem Saraswati and Harivar Vip can be considered as the earliest poets of Assamese based on the latest available material
 hem saraswati kaa "prahlaadacharitra" asamiya kaa pratham likhit granth mana jaataa he
 Both these poets were dependents of Kamatur's ruler Rare Narayan
 ek tisare prasiddh kavi kabiratn saraswati bhi the, jinhone "jaydrathvadh" likhaa
 But the most famous poet of the Vaishnavite period was Madhava Kandali, who composed his compositions under the shelter of King Mahamanya
 madhav kandali ke ramayana ke anuwaad ne vishesh khyaati praapt kii
 Converting Sanskrit vocabulary into Assamese was a special art of the poet
 is kaal kii anya footkar rachanaaon main kuch geetikavy ullekhneey hai
 In these compositions, the people of the time were particularly rewarded
 tantra mantra, manasapuja aadi ke vidhaan is varg kii kritiyon main adhik charchit hue hai
 Some deities associated with Vishnu were given importance in earlier compositions of this period
 parantu aage chalakar vishnu kii puja kii vishesh rup se pratishtha hui
 In this change of position, the sum of the great Assamese poet and religious reformer Shankardev AD was more than enough
 shankardev kii adhikansh rachanaayen bhagwatpurana par aadhaarit hai or unke mat ko bhagwati dharm kaha jaataa he
 Shankardev is credited for adapting Assamese life and culture in its specific form
 isliye kuch sameekshak unke vyaktitv ko keval kavi ke rup main hi simit nahin karnaa chaahate
 They basically consider him as a religious reformer
 shankardev kii bhakthi ke pramukh aashray the shrikrishna
 He has about 30 compositions, of which "kirthanghosh" is his masterpiece
 asamiya sahitya ke prasiddh natyarup "ankiya naatak" ke prarambhkarta bhi shankardev hi hai
 His plays offer an equal mix of prose and verse

 The phrase "ankiya Nataka" is called "vargit", whose language is mainly Brajbuli

 Among other writers of this era, Anant Kandali, Sridhar Kandali and Bhattadev are particularly notable

 After the Ahom kings were established in Assam, the inspiring trend of literature composed in their shelter became secular rather than religious
 raajaaon kaa yashvarnan is kaal ke kaviyon kaa ek pramukh kartavya ho gaya
 As such, the tradition of historiography was already prevalent among the Ahom kings
 kaviyon kii yashvarnan kii pravriti ko ashrayadata raajaaon ne is ore mode diya
 First the Ahom language history texts were translated into Assamese and then basically the Buranjis started being created
 "buranji" mulat: ek ti shabd he, jiskaa arth he "agyaat kathaon kaa bhandar"
 a considerable systematic history of the medieval era of Assam is available through these Buranjis
 buranji sahitya ke antargat kamrup buranji, kachaari buranji, ahom buranji, jayantiya bunraji, beliar buranji ke naam apekshaakrit adhik prasiddh hai
 Apart from these Buranji texts, extensive dynasties of dynasties also occurred during this period

 Books on art and dance were also written

 In this period, two Assamese poems were written based on the plots of two Hindi Sufi poetry
 par mulat: yah yug gadhy ke vikaas kaa he
 Like the literature of many other provincial languages, the beginning of the modern period is associated with English rule in Assamese
 1826 i
 assam main angreji shashan ke prarambh kii tithi he
 In this era, the suppression of indigenous sentiments and social inequality mainly inspired the writers
 idhar 1838 i
 se hi videshi mishnariyon ne bhi apana kaary prarambh kiya or janata main dharmprachaar kaa madhyam asamiya ko hi banaaya
 As a result, in the development of Assamese language, printing and publication in a systematic manner operated by these missionaries also helped at one level

 Some westerns were also adopted through Adarsh bungalow

 Among other authors, the names of Hemachandra Barua, Gunabhiram Barua and Satyanash Boda are notable

 These authors were Chandrakumar Aggarwal, Lakshminath Bezbarua and Hemchandra Goswami

 By gradually making this magazine a center, a literary community arose, later called the Jonaki Group

 Lakshminath Bezbarua was a versatile genius among these writers of the early 20th century
 unka "asamiya saahityer chaaneki" naamak sankalan vishesh prasiddh he
 In Assamese literature, he introduced a common form between the story and the fine essay
 bejbarua kii hasyaras kii rachanaaon ko kaaphi lokapriyata mili
 That is why he was given the title of "rasraj"
 is yug main anya kaviyon main kamalakant bhattacharya, raghunatha choudhary, nalinibala devi, ambikagiri raichaudhuri, phukan aadi kaa krititv mahatvapurn mana jaataa he

 Among the prose authors who produced literature parallel to the Jonaki community, the names of Venudhar Rajkhowa and Sharachandra Goswami are particularly notable
 sharachchandra goswami kii pratibha vaise to bahumukhi thi, par unki khyaati pramukhat: kahaniyon ko lekar he
 In the field of story, Lakshmidhar Sharma, Bina Barua, Krishna Bhuyan etc
 made some experiments of new ideas related to love
 lakshminath phukan apni hasyaras kii kahaniyon ke liye smaraneey hai
 Apart from Kathasahthya, the work of Atulchandra Hazarika and Jyotiprasad Agarwal is more important in the field of drama
 samiksha tathaa shodh kii drushti se ambikanath bara, vanikant kakati, kaliram medhi, viranchi barua tathaa dimbeshwar niyog kaa krititv ullekhneey he
 In the modern period of Assamese literature, the medium of journal magazines also became quite popular
 inamen se "arunoday", "jonaki", "boli", "aavahan", "jayanti", tathaa "pachhova" ne vibhinn kshetron main kaaphi upyogi kaary kiya he
 a new type of literature has been created, mainly by making "ramdhenu" the center
 is yug main paashchaatya prabhaav adhik swasth tathaa santulit rup main aae hai
 Elliot and his associate English poets have primarily inspired new Assamese writers
 keval kavita main hi nahin, kathasahitya tathaa naatak main bhi in nae prayogon kii pravriti dekhi ja sakati he
 New problems have been raised by both sociological and psychological problems
 unke shilp sambandhi prayog bhi kam mahatvapurn nahin hai
 The literature-interest-richness of ancient Assam can be traced back to the then copper plates
 isi prakaar vahaan ke pustakotpaadan ke sambandh main bhi ek pracheen ullekh miltaa he, jiske anusaar kumaar bhaskaravarman ne apane mitra kannaujasamrat harshavardhan ko sundar lipi main likhi hui anek pustakan bhent kii thim
 One of these books was probably a compilation of proverbs and idioms prevalent in the then Assam
 bahut pracheen kaal se hi assam main sangitpriyata kii parampara chalati aa rahi he
 As a result of this, there are virtually many folk songs presented by unwritten and unknown writers in modern Assam, which have been preserved from oral tradition from one generation to the next
 ye logageet dharmik avasaron, achaaron tathaa rituon ke paritarwanon se sambhddha hai
 In some folklore, stories of prince heroes are also found
 shisht sahitya ke udbhav ke purv is kaal main darshanik dak kaa mahatv asaadhaaran he
 His statements have been called Vedavakya
 dakvachanon kii yah parampara bengal tathaa bihar tak milti he
 Almost every family of Assam used to have a handwritten compilation of these postalogies till some time back
 assam ke pracheen naam "kamrup" se prakat hota he ki vahaan bahut pracheen kaal se tantra mantra kii parampara rahi he
 There are many types of mantras related to these Guhyachars, which give some introduction to the initial stage of language and literature
 "charyaapad" ke lekhak sidhon main se kai kaa kamrup se ghanisht sambandh bataaya jaataa he, jo is pradesh kii tantric parampara ko dekhte hue kaaphi swaabhaavik jaan padataa he
 Thus oral literature from the time of Chariyapada to the 13th century is either of popular folk songs and folk songs or of proverbs and mantras
