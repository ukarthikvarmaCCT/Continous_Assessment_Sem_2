 It originated in Vikram Samvat 1817
 iskaa pravartan muni bheekhan ne kiya tha jo kaalaantar main acharya bhikshu kahalaaye
 He was originally a member of the Sthanwakasi Sangh and a disciple of Acharya Raghunathji
 acharya sant bheekhan ji ne jab aatmakalyaan kii bhaavana se prerit hokar shithilataa kaa bahishkaar kiya tha, tab unke saamne nayaa sangh sthapit karne kii baat nahin thi
 But the basic elements of Jainism were to be propagated and overcome the dysfunction in the Sage Sangh
 us dhyey me ve kashton kii parvaah na karte hue apane maarg par adig rahe
 He had never even thought about naming the organization, yet the name of the organization became Terapanth
 iskaa kaaran nimnokt ghatana he
 Once in Jodhpur, 13 disciples who followed the principles of Acharya monk were sitting in a shop and helping out
 udhar se vahaan ke tatkaaleen dewan fatehsingh ji sindhi gujarey to dekha, shravak yahan samayik kyon kar rahe hai
 He asked the reason for this
 uttar main shravakon ne bataaya shriman hamaare sant bheekhan ji ne staandon ko chhod diya he
 They say, except for one house, it is not appropriate for the sadhus to make a place in the village
 ham bhi unke vichaaron se sahamat hai
 That is why we are doing here
 dewan ji ke aagrah par unhone sara vivaran sunaaya, us samay vahaan ek sevak jati kaa kavi khadaa sari ghatana sun rahaa tha
 He immediately took into consideration the number of 13 and said a couplet- bas yahi ghatana terapanth ke naam kaa kaaran bani
 When Swamiji came to know that our name has changed to Terapanti, he immediately left the seat and saluted the Lord, meaning the word - o Lord this is your creed
 hamane tera arthath tumhaara panth sweekaar kiya he
 Therefore, your script is there
 acharya sant bheekhan ji ne sarvapratham sadhu sanstha ko sangathit karne ke liye ek maryadapatr likhaa
 In it, he wrote that - sabhi sadhu-sadhviyaan ek hi acharya kii ajna main rahen
 The present Acharya should elect the future Acharya
 koi bhi sadhu anushaasan kaa bhang na kare
 Immediately be expelled from the union for breach of discipline
 koi bhi sadhu alag shishy na banaae
 Only the Acharya has the right to initiate
 acharya jahaan kahe, vahaan muni vihaar vaa chaturmaas kare
 Do not do as you wish
 acharya ke prati nishthabhaav rakhe, aadi
 On the basis of these dignities, for 250 years today, the Terapanth Shraman Sangh, while maintaining its organization, is playing an important part in the public welfare trends under the leadership of its eleventh Acharya Shri Mahashramanji

 saanskrithik maanavshaastra athwa saanskrithik nritatv vigyaan maanav or uske kaaryon kaa adhyayan he
 There are two major parts of anthropology- manushya kaa pranishastreey adhyayan, uskaa udbhav evam vikaas, maanav-sharir-rachana, prajnan shaastra evam prajati ityadi shaareerik maanav shaastra ke antargat hai
 Man is a social animal and lives in groups
 vishwa ke samast jeevadhariyon main keval vahi samskruti kaa nirmaataa he
 The root cause of this feature is language
 bhashaa ke hi madhyam se ek peedi kii sanchit anubhuti bhavishya kii pidiyon ko milti he
 Every generation's culture develops
 samskruti parisar kaa vah bhaag he jiskaa nirmaan maanav swayan karata he
 E
 B
 According to Tiler, culture is the name of a set that contains knowledge, belief, art, policy, law, customs and other such abilities and habits that humans consider as members of society
 saanskrithik maanavshastri un tareekon kaa adhyayan karata he jisase maanav apni prakritik evam saamaajik sthiti kaa saamana karata he, rasm rivaajon ko sikhta or unhen ek pusht se agali pusht ko pradaan karata he
 Different cultures have many means to achieve the same goal
 paariwarik sambandhon kaa sanghathan, machhlee pakadaney ke fande tathaa jagat ke nirmaan ke siddhant prayek samaaj main alag-alag he
 Nevertheless, life in every society is well planned
 aantarik vikaas yaa bahya sampark ke kaaran parampara ke sthir rup bhi badalte hai
 a person born in a particular society accepts, practices and influences the customs which are his cultural heritage
 saanskrithik maanav shaastra ke antargat aise saare vishay aate hai
 The field of cultural anthropology is very wide
 anya vishay maanav kaaryaklap ke ek bhaag kaa adhyayan karte hai
 In general, anthropologists study castes that are beyond the Western cultural stream
 ve prayek jati ke rasm-rivaajon ke samooh ko ek samshti ke rup main adhyayan karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 If they focus their studies on only one side of the culture, then their main objective is to analyze the relationship between that side and other sides of the culture
 puri samskruti par vichaar karne ke liye ve us samaaj ke logon kaa takneekee gyaan, aarthik jivan, saamaajik or raajnneetik sansthaayen, dharm, bhashaa, lokvarta evam kala kaa adhyayan karte hai
 They discuss these parties separately but also see how they work in different ways in which the members of that society are organized from their premises
 is rup main saanskrithik maanavshastri arthshaastri, raajnneeti-vigyaan-shastri, samajashastri dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyeta, kala yaa sahitya ke marmagyon se bhinn hai
 The word culture is used in many ways
 maanavshaastra main iskaa prayog ek vishisht arth main hota he
 This is its fundamental principle
 samskruti ke gun nimnlikhit hai- Human does not take birth with culture but has the ability to take culture
 vah use sikhta he
 This process is called Sanskritisation
 samskruti kaa udbhav maanav jivan ke praani shastreey, parisareey manovaigyanik or aitihaasik angon se hota he
 These elements have valuable value in its formulation and development
 samskruti kii sanrachana ke vishisht bhaag hai
 The smallest part is called cultural element
 kai tatwon ko milakar ek tatv samooh hota he
 There are many cultural elements in a culture
 iske atirikt kai samskritiyon main ek yaa adhik prerak siddhant hote hai jo unhen vishistataa pradaan karte hai
 Culture is divided into many departments, such as material culture, social institutions, religion and faith, art and folklore, language, etc
 samskruti parivartansheel he
 There is change in every part of the culture, in some in intensity, in some in slow motion
 bahya prabhaav bhi bina soche-samajhe grahan nahin kiye jate
 There is less opposition in some, more in some
 samskruti main vibhinnataayen hoti hai jo kabhi-kabhi ek hi samaaj ke vyaktiyon ke vyavhaar main pradarshit hoti hai
 The smaller the unit, the less difference will be in the ethics of its members
 samskruti ke swaroop, prakriyaaon or gathan main ek niyambaddhata hoti he jisase uskaa vaigyanik vishleshan sambhav hota he
 Through culture, a human is organized from his entire campus and he gets the means of creative expression
 saanskrithik maanav shaastra vartmaan kaal kii samskritiyon kaa hi keval adhyayan nahin karata
 How many esoteric mysteries of human development lie in the womb of prehistory
 pragaitihaasik puratatvvetta prithvi ke neeche se khudaai karke pracheen samskritiyon kii chaanbin karte hai
 On the basis of this, they determine the hierarchical nature of human development
 khudaai se bhautik samskruti kii bahut-si chijen uplabdh hoti hai
 With the help of conjecture and imagination, we prepare the outline of living, ethics, social organization, religious belief etc
 of the members of that culture
 atev pragaitihaas saanskrithik maanav shaastra kaa abhinn ang he
 Culture has been created through language itself
 sristi ke aarambh se hi manushya ne anek tarah se apni ichchhaaon or aavashyaktaaon ko vyakt karne kaa prayaas kiya
 First, the gestures and signs worked
 baad main usee ne bhashaa kaa rup grahan kar liya
 In every language, all the beliefs of its speakers, clear and vague thoughts, intellectual and emotional actions are devoid of
 aadim samaaj ke sabhi saanskrithik tatv uski bhashaa ke bhandar main surakshit rahete hai
 The rites of society are displayed in proverbs, puzzles, folklore, folklore, prayer mantras, etc
 samaaj kii antarmukhi vritiyon se parichay praapt karne ke liye bhashaa kaa gyaan atyaavashyak he
 Relationship terminology refers to family and other relationships in society
 samskruti par bahya prabhaavon ke kaaran jo parivartan hota he vah bhi bhashaa main pratibimbit hota he
 When new ideas and new things start coming in practice, then new words also accompany them
 is prakaar samskruti or bhashaa donon kaa samaan rup se vikaas hota he
 There is an infinite amount of research into the diversity and complexity of languages in Adi cultures
 jis tarah bhashaa ke swaroop kaa vishleshan karne se ham saanskrithik rahasyon ko sulajhaa sakate hai usee prakaar samskritiyon ke sanrachanaatmak tatwon or prakriyaaon ke gyaan se hamen bhashaa shaastra kii kuch samasyaon par vyapak prakaash mil saktaa he
 Cultural anthropology covers the study of social, economic and political life, religion, language, art, etc
 tiler ne samskruti ke sambodh ke sahare adhyayan kiya par unke samakaleen moragan ne samaaj ke prasang main apana kaam kiya
 Durkheim reinforced the classical tradition of society
 is prakaar nritatv main donon paramparaayen samanaantar dhaaraon kii tarah chalati aa rahi hai
 American anthropologists are born of cultural ideology
 angrej vidwaan durkaeem isi parampara ke poshak hai
 In American scholars, the perception of culture is much broader than the perception of society
 is prakaar saamaajik maanav shaastra unki drushti se saanskrithik nritatv kaa ek ang he
 Some scholars will not agree with this notion
 unke anusaar saanskrithik or saamaajik maanav shaastra ke drushtikon, vichaardhaara or tareeke bhinn-bhinn hai
 The field of social anthropology is human culture and society
 yah santhabaddh saamaajik vyavhaaron kaa adhyayan karata he, jaise parivaar, naatedari, vyavastha, raajnneetik sanghathan, vidhi, dharmik mat ityadi
 In this institution, mutual relations are also studied
 aisa adhyayan samakaleen samaajon main yaa aitihaasik samaajon main kiya jaataa he
 Social anthropologists generally work in primitive cultures
 iskaa yah arth nahin ki aadim samaaj dusron se hey he
 In a primitive society, which are small and simple in terms of population, area, external connectivity etc
 and are technically backward
 aadim jatiyon par vishesh dhyaan dene ke kai kaaran hai
 Some anthropologists used to study primitive castes in order to trace the development of culture
 aisa samajha jaataa tha ki un samaajon main aisi hi sansthaayen pai jaati hai jo duusare samaajon main pracheen kaal main pai jaati thim
 After the prevalence of functionalist ideology, there was a need to study society as a whole
 iske liye aadim samaaj atyant upyukt the kyonki unamem ekarupata thi or purna samshti ke rup main unhen dekha ja saktaa tha
 Then it was easy to study cultures other than ourselves
 unke vivechan main nirpekshata aasaani se barti ja sakati thi
 Many examples of social polymorphism can be found in primitive societies
 un par aadhaarit jo sambodh banenge ve adhik drudh or vyapak honge
 Primitive societies are changing rapidly
 lupt hone ke purv unka adhyayan aavashyak he
 The most important part of social anthropology is the social organization in which the deliberations of those institutions determine the place of man and woman in the society and give direction to their personal relationships
 mote taur par aisi sansthaayen do prakaar kii hoti hai jo rishte se utpann hoti hai or jo vyaktiyon ke swatantra sampark se utpann hoti hai
 Family and gotra come in kinship institutions
 duusare prakaar kii sansthaaon main santhabaddh maitri, gupt samitiyaan, aayu samooh aate hai
 Groups based on social status also come under this
 saamaajik sanghathan kuch aadharbhoot karkon par bana hota he, jaise aayu, yon, bhed, rishtedaari, sthaan, saamaajik sthiti, raajnneetik sthiti, vyavsaay, aichhik samitiyaan, jaduvarg kii prakriyaayein or taatamawaad 
 The human relations and efforts that are organized to fulfill the requirements of daily life with minimum labor have been termed as economic anthropology
 bhojan praapt karne or utpann karne ke anek tareeke vibhinn jatiyon main prachlit hai
 Four main levels are found on the basis of them - collection-hunting-level, animal husbandry level, agricultural level and craft-industry-level
 aadim samaajon main aarthik sambandh saamaajik paramparaon main bandhe rahete hai
 It is also difficult to distinguish between factors of production
 aadim jagat kii arthvyavastha main uphaar or vyapaar vinimay kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Personal and collective relationships are strengthened by gifts
 vyapaar or vinimay main utpaadan ke vitaran kaa mahatv adhik hota he
 Many primitive societies are currencyless
 arthshaastreey maane main bazaar kaa bhi abhaav he
 Nevertheless, their economic organization is running smoothly
 arthvyavastha bhautik samskruti evam logon kii takneekee kshamta par nirbhar hoti he
 The study of hunting, fishing methods, farming methods and industries is also under this study
 pehle ke maanav shastri is prakaar ke adhyayan main adhik ruchi rakhte the or unke prayaason ke falswaroop videshon ke sangrahalay aadim bhautik samskruti kii vastuon se bhare pade hai
 Humans have always had a desire to know invisible and unknown powers
 unke vishay main bhinn-bhinn kalpanaayen or vishwaas prachlit hai
 When we do not understand any reason for any event, then we take it as a goddess incident and get satisfaction
 dharm or jaadu inhen adrishy or agyaat vyaktiyon ko apane paksh main prabhavit karne ke liye banaae gaye hai
 While studying the organization, achievements and progress of any society, it is necessary to get acquainted with the religious background
 dharm hamamen suraksha kii bhaavana jagaata he
 Followers of a religion are bound in a firm thread of unity
 dharm kii chhap hamen kisi bhi samaaj ke samast kriyakalapon par milti he
 Art, literature, music, dance etc
 were initially inspired by religious sentiment
 unka adhyayan bhi saanskrithik maanav shaastra ke antargat aata he
 There is a big difference among anthropologists regarding the origin and development of culture
 unnisvin shatabdi main darwin ke udvikas ke siddhant se anek adhyeta prabhavit hue
 In the cultural field too, scholars like Tiler, Morgan etc
 recognized it
 is siddhant ke sahare maanav samskruti ke vikaas ko acchhee tarah samajha ja saktaa tha
 Accordingly, three levels of development were determined
 nimnatam str jungleepan, madhya str ko barbarta or ucchtam str ko sabhyataa kii sangya di gai
 The reason for cultural similarities in different parts of the world was explained by the tendency to think in a way and to build similar institutions in the same environment
 prasarwaad ke siddhant ne is manyata ko thukraa diya
 According to this, culture originated in some places and spread from there
 prasarwaad ke kuch pandit mishra ko samskruti kaa udgam sthal maanate the
 The spreaders believe that the invented power of man is very limited and the eclipse power is infinite
 vienna ke nritatvavettaon ne isi aadhaar par sansar ke pramukh samskruti vruton sambandhi manyataayen sthapit kii hai
 There is no doubt that cultures change by invention and spread
 anya samskritiyon ke tatv kai kaarnon se grahan kiye jate hai
 Some are adopted due to pressure, some for innovation, some for convenience and some for profit
 kuch naveen tatv pratishtha badhaane ke liye apanaae jate hai
 Barnett offers a new discussion of culture change
 ve utprekshan ko samskruti-parivartan kaa aadhaar maanate hai
 Inspirations arise from human desires
 yadhyapi ve samskruti parivartan ke kaaran hote hai, phir bhi ve swayan saanskrithik paristhitiyon or karkon se achoote nahin rahete
 a state of dissatisfaction is essential for the success of catalysis

 gorakhnath ke anuyaayi pramukh rup se hathyog kii sadhana karte the
 He is also called Nath Yogi
 shaiva dhara ke atirikt baudhon ne bhi hathyog kii paddati apanaayi thi
 People's belief about Hatha Yoga is that the word 'hatha' is used in the sense 'prachanda' or 'bal' with the suffix + Hatha
 hathen yaa hathaat kriya-visheshan ke rup main prayukt karne par iskaa arth balpurvak yaa prachandta purvak, achaanak yaa duraagrahpurvak arth main liya jaataa he
 'hatha Vidya' is accepted in the feminine sense of the science of 'forceful meditation'
 is prakaar saamanytah log hathyog ko ek aise yoga ke rup main jaanate hai jisamen hath purvak kuch shaareerik evam maansik kriyaayein kii jaatin hai
 For this reason, the hexa activities of body refinement which are different from the processes of normal body refinement are considered as Hatha Yoga
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 Shatkarma is only a means of purification of the body

 Broadly, Hatha Yoga or Pranayama is done in three parts - is prakaar sapreyas praanon ko apane niyantran se gati dena hathyog he
 This hatha yoga forms the foundation for the accomplishment of Raja Yoga
 bina hathyog kii sadhana ke rajyog kii prapti bada kathin kaary he
 Therefore, if the practice of Hatha Yoga is proven, it is easy to move towards Raja Yoga

 The path of worship is also the transformation of Raja Yoga, which has been described in the Ishwar Pranidhan Sutra with the word 'ishwar Pranidhan'
 vartmaan samay main prachlit shakt, shaiva, vaishnav aadi sampradaay ishwar pranidhan naam ke yoga se gruhit hote hai
 The commentator of this Patanjal Yoga Sutra, Shri Ved Vyas Ji has tried to explain it in the following way- bhoj ne bhojavritti main isaki vyakhya nimnlikhit prakaar se kii he- That is, Godless element without Kaleshadi has been said in the scriptures by many names, so it cannot be given a single noun
 isliye vyas bhashya main kaha gaya haih- Therefore, by creating the names of Shiva, Vishnu, Mahashakti etc
 and the Puranadi texts with their names, the trend of Tattadbhavana bhavati-bhakti Yoga has been done by Maharishi Vyasa
 jeev ishwar kaa hi ansh he tathaa ansh main kaleshaadi ke rahane par yoga kii sthiti nahin ban sakati he
 For this it is necessary to remove the tribulation
 karmo ke anuroop vyakti sharir grahan kar bhaavana bhashit hota he
 These feelings are of sattvic, rajasic and tamasic type
 in alag-alag swaroopon kii bhaawanaaon ke saamanjasy hetu yogon ke prakaar bhi pruthak-pruthak ho jate hai
 Mental emotion is the root for making actions, actions and actions
 karm kaa swaroop ek dikhaai dene par bhi maansik bhaavana main antar hone ke kaaran unke swaroop tathaa parinaamon main bhi antar aa jaataa he
 This fact has been stated in the Maitrayasupanishad as follows - arthath manushya kaa man hi bandhan evam moksh dono kaa hi kaaran banataa he
 Being enamored in subjects leads to bondage and salvation if not enamored in subjects
 shrimadbhagwat gita main bhi paanchave adhyay ke gyarahawein tathaa atharahawein adhyay ke pandrahaven sutara main ukt tathy ko nimnlikhit prakaar se spasht kiya gaya he- That is, the Karmayogi only by sensory, mind, intellect and body also abandon attachment and perform actions for purification of conscience
 manushya man, vaani or sharir se shastranukool athwa vipareet jo kuch bhi karm karata he unke ye paanchon kaaran hai
 In this way, the practice of generating karma and controlling the mind is the soul, and the skill of controlling the soul by gaining control over the mind is hatha yoga
 hathyog ‘‘shaareerik or maansik shuddhi tathaa santulan praapt karne kaa saadhan he‘‘
 According to Agama, Nigam, Upanishads and other texts related to yoga science, the word hatha is formed by the combination of two mantras
 iskaa aashay manushya sharir main sthit pranavahi naadiyon ida evam pingala ke sambandh se liya jaataa he
 In the flow of Eda and Pingala, the mind remains calm
 atah man ko antahmukhi karne hetu praan ko sam arthath na to ida or na hi pingala main pravaahit hone dena he, balki in donon ke madhya sthit naadee jise sushumna kehete hai praanon kaa pravaah hone par man shant evam swaniyantran main ho jaataa he
 Hatha Yoga in the above context refers to the sum by which the balance between these two powers can be established
 ida nadee hamaare sharir kii ek pramukh pranic vahika he
 It symbolizes the passive aspect of Prana which is expressed and felt in the form of Manashakti or Chittashakti
 pingala kaa sambandh or shakti, tejasvi shakti yaa sakriyata se he jo shaareerik aayam main pranashakti ke rup main abhivyakt or anubhoot hoti he
 In this way, Hatha Yoga is related to the pranic flow of the body

 For this reason Hatha Yoga is also called 'pranayoga' in the Vedas
