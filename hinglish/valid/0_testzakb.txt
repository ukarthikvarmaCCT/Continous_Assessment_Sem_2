 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics

 The number of chromosomes in each cell is constant and fixed
 koshika kaa vibhaajan do mukhya prakaar kaa hota he : sutri vibhaajan, jisamen vibhaajan ke pashchaat bhi varnakotpadakon kii sankhya vahi rahati hai or ardhasutri vibhaajan, jisamen varnakotpadakon kii sankhya aadhi ho jaati he
 Every attribute of any plant or other organism is due to genes
 ye apni ruparekha peedi dar peedi banaae rakhte hai
 The pair of each gene is also on the semicircular, which is called allyl of each other
 jin ardhasuthran ke samay alag alag ho jate hai or ye swatantra rup se hote hai
 If allele genes show two properties, such as tall or dwarf plants, colored and white flowers, etc
, one is dominant in the pair gene and the other is ineffective

 aajkal ke vaigyanikon kaa mat he ki prakruti main naanaa vidhiyon se jin pranali ekaek badal sakati he
 This is called mutation
 aise anek utparivartan hote rahete hai, par jo janankriya main khare utren or vaataavaran main jam saken, ve rah jate hai
 This is how new plants are produced

 These are called multiplicities
 bahugunitata dwaara bhi nae jeevon kii utpatti kaa vikaas hota he
 The study of the environment, relationship or shelter of organisms or plants is called ecology
 paudhe samaaj main rahete hai
 They change the environment and the environment changes the structure of their society
 yah kram baar baar chalata rahata he
 This is called indexing
 ek sthiti aisi aati he jab vaataavaran or paudhon ke samaaj ek prakaar se gatik samya main aa jate hai
 Plants of changing sequestration call society as sequential and dynamic equilibrium is called extreme state
 kisi bhi jalwaayu main ek nishchit prakaar kaa gatik samya hota he
 Apart from this, if some other type of stable society is formed, then it is considered to be a level lower than that, not an extreme state
 aisi paristhiti ko vaigyanik monoclymex vichaar maanate hai or jalwaayu ko shreshthatam kaaran maanate hai
 The opposite is the polyclimax ideology, in which any factor, not only climate, can be predominant
 paudhon ke vaataavaran ke vichaar se teen mukhya chijen jalwaayu, jeevajantu tathaa mitti hai
 Nowadays ecosystem ideology and new ideas are becoming more accepted
 ghaas ke maidan, nadi, talab yaa samudr, jangal ityadi echosystem ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Plants in ecology with the idea of water jalodabhid, jo jal main ugte hai, Aphrodisiacs, which are on earth and where even equal amounts of water are found, and jirophite, jo sookhe registan main ugte hai, kehete hai
 The morphology of these plants is adapted to live in a particular environment, such as hydropower plants have airborne tissue that can also respire and float in water
 jangal ke bare main adhyayan, yaa silviculture, bhi paristhitiki kaa hi ek bhaag samajha ja saktaa he
 That part of ecology that is for the benefit of man is called applied ecology
 jo paudhe baaluu main ugte hai, unhen samodbhid kehete hai
 Similarly, the plants grown on stone are known as Shallabhid and acidophilites growing on acid soil
 jo paudhe namakvaale daldal main ugte hai, unhen lavanamridodbhid kehete hai, jaise sundarbans ke garaan, jo teevr suryaprakash main ugte hai unhen atpodbhid or jo chhaanh main ugte hai, unhen samophita kehete hai
 Under this, how every function is done in the body of plants is studied
 jeevadravya kolaidi prakruti kaa hota he or yah jal main bikharaa rahata he
 According to the physical laws, water or salts enter the walls of the articular cells of the root follicles from the soil and enter the vascular canal growing through the flow of concentration
 yahan se yah jal ityadi kis prakaar upar kii ore chadhenge isapar vaigyanikon main sahmati nahin thi, par ab yah mana jaataa he ki ye keshikeey reeti se keshika nalee dwaara jad se unche tane ke bhaag main pahunch jate hai
 The water of the body of the plants comes in contact with the atmosphere through the pores of the leaf
 yahan bhi jal ke kan vaayu main nikal jate hai, yadi vaayu main jal kaa sandran kam he
 Just as the water of a wet cloth evaporates out of the air, it is also a physical work
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki paudhon ko har kaary ke liye urja kahan se milti he tathaa urja kaise ek prakaar se duusare prakaar main badal jaati he
 In a nutshell, it can be said that the light on the disinfectant makes the glucose and oxygen by holding carbon dioxide and water by capturing the energy of light

 Therefore the calculation of the history of the company begins from the date of founding of the following companies: In 1812, the City Bank of New York; In 1870, Bank Handlovi; Smith Barney in 1873, Banamex in 1873; Salomon Brothers in 1910

 In September 1992, Travelers Insurance, which faced bad real estate investment and sustained significant losses following Andrew Storm, formed a strategic alliance with Parimerica in December 1993 under which it was integrated into a single company

 Finally, in November 1997, the Travelers Group decided to buy Salomon Brothers for $ 9 billion, a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank
 
 solomon bros ne smith barne ko nai pratibhuti ikai main avashoshit kar liya jiskaa naam solomon smith barne rakhaa gaya tha; ek saal baad, is prabhag ne citicorp ke purv pratibhuti prachaalanon ko bhi shaamil kiya
 The name Salomon Smith Byrne was eventually dropped in October 2003 due to a series of financial scandals that tarnished the bank's reputation

 The remaining provision of the glass-steagall Act - which was enacted after the Great Depression - prohibited banks from merging with insurance underwriters and meant that Citigroup had time between two and five years to recover any Disinvestment of prohibited property
 However, Weil said at the time of the merger that he believed "that the legislation will change after that time 


 We have discussed enough to gain the confidence that this will not become a problem"
 Indeed, the passage of the gramm-leach-bliele Act in November 1999 confirmed the views of Reid and Weil, which opened the way for the financial services organization to offer a mix of commercial banking, investment banking, insurance risk marking and brokerage

 "associates were widely criticized for their predatory lending method, and Citi eventually paid $ 240 million to customers who were victims of predatory methods such as" flipping "mortgages," packing "mortgages with alternative credit insurance, and misleading marketing practices
 Upon agreeing to this, the matter was settled with the Federal Trade Commission
 company ne 2002 main apane travelers property and cajmulti beemaa jokhim ankan vyapaar ko punargathit kiya
 This restructuring was driven by the insurance unit's pull on Citigroup's share prices as travelers' earnings were more seasonal and sensitive to major disasters, especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City
 This type of insurance was also difficult to sell directly to the customer as most industrial customers had the habit of purchasing insurance through a broker

 As the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis weighed heavily in the form of a collateralized debt obligation, coupled with poor risk management, led Citigroup to trouble
 The company used a detailed risk mathematical model that focused on mortgages from particular geographic areas, but never included prospects such as a national housing slump or the possibility that millstone mortgage holders would miss out on their mortgages

 Even after the securities and brokerage firm, Bear Stearns, went into serious trouble in the summer of 2007, Citigroup considered the likelihood of problems with its CDO so small that they excluded it from its risk analysis
 With the crisis worsening, Citigroup announced on 7 January 2008 that it was considering retrenching once again from 5 percent to 10 percent of its total workforce, which was 327,000

 On 16 January 2009, Citigroup announced its intention to reorganize itself into two operating units: Citicorp for its retail and investment banking and Citi Holding for brokerage and asset management
 For now Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company, but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to "take advantage of value-enhancing opportunities and combination opportunities as they emerge", and eventually spin-off or a merger involving one of the operating units was not ruled out
 On February 27, 2009, Citigroup announced that 36% of the company's equity would be taken by the United States government by converting $ 25 billion of emergency aid into common shares
