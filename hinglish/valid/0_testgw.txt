 Chach was the ruler of a Brahmin dynasty that ruled Sindh in the middle of the seventh century
 vah ek bhootpurv mantri or raja raay saahsee kaa pramukh salaahkaara tha
 After the death of the king, his widow became queen by marrying the queen
 usne apane samrajya ko sindh tak failaayaa
 The story of bold and successful attempts to unite the small 2 states, tribes and other independent factions of the Indus Valley into its empire is written in Chachnama
 chach ek brahman tha jo raay rajvansh ke sindh ke raja raay saheeras ke kaarykaal main prabhavi padon tak pahunchaa
 His father's name was Shilaise and brother's name Chander and before becoming king he had been the most influential chief minister of King Daring of Sindh
 kehete hai ki raja saahsee kii mrityu ke baad use vidhwaa rani se prem ho gaya or unase shaadi kar ke raja ban gaya
 He was opposed by Raja Daring's brother and contemporary King Rana Maharath of Chittaun and claimed his empire in Sindh
 haalanki baad main chach ne 660 isvi main unhen yuddh main parrast kar diya
 According to Chachanama, when Rana Maharath found that his army could not do much in front of Chach's army, he challenged Chach for a duel battle
 maharath apane kshatriya hone, yudhkala main nipun hone va chach ke ek saamaanya brahman mantri hone kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahate the
 He knew that Chach as a Brahmin would not be proficient in warfare and would be defeated by him
 chach is prastaav ke peeche kii manshaa ko samaj chukaa tha lekin vah is prastaav ko thukraa bhi nahin saktaa tha
 In doing so, he would be considered weak and his ability to govern would also be questioned
 usne rana ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya
 Chach knew that to win this duel war he would have to use all kinds of diplomatic and mental powers because he could not defeat Rana on the strength of physical ability and warfare
 isaliye usne ek chaalaaki bharaa daanv khelte hue rana kaa prastaav swikar kar liya or yah shart rakkhi kii ek brahman hone ne naate vah ghode par baithkar yuddh nahin kar saktaa he or vah paidal hi yuddh karegaa
 Rana immediately accepted this proposal as he felt that due to being experienced and more powerful, he would immediately defeat him in a face-to-face battle
 donon ghodon par se utar gayi lekin chach ne apane sahaayak sainik ko ghode ke saath apane peeche aane ko kaha
 As soon as he got close, Chach rode on the horse and attacked the Rana standing fast
 usne rana kaa sir apni talwaar se ek jatke main kaat diya or rana kii mrityu ke baad uski sena bhi haar gai
 Chach authorized his brother Chander to help in the rule of his empire

 This behavior of Chuch from the brave castes of Sindh proved ultimately fatal for India
 brahmanabad se usne turan va kandahar hote hue armanbela nagar kii simaaon par sthit saasanid par hamalaa kiya
 Chach ruled for forty years, but where he grew the kingdom, he also made him weak with some of his works
 uski mrityu ke baad uske bhai chander ne 8 varshon tak shashan kiya jiske baad chach ke jyeshtha putr raja daahir ne shashan sambhala
 According to Chachnama, Chach did misbehavior with Jats and Lohanas

 They had to wear black and red northerners, silk clothes were forbidden for them
 unhen ghode par bina jin ke chadhana or nange sir, nange pair ghoomana padataa tha
 They were ordered to keep dogs with them on exit and by cutting and supplying wood for the royal kitchen
 yah sab lohana ke liye behad asammanjanak baaten thi jisane unamem rajya ke prati asantosh bhar diya
 Chach was expected to revolt for power from Jato, so he enlisted in the army to keep them away from power, but did not give important posts related to advisors because he was afraid that these Jats would overturn the Kshatriya coup

 Fatigue is the degradation of production speed by doing a work continuously
 thakaan ko saadharantaya sabhi log jaanate hai, phir bhi iske swaroop ko pahchaanana bahut kathin he
 The scientific definition of fatigue is given by Gilbraith

 thakaa hua vyakti aise kaary karne lagata he jo vah saamaanya sthiti main nahin karata he
 In this regard, researchers have based on their findings that industrial fatigue affects the production and society along with the adjustment of the employee
 florence naamak vidwaan ne thakaan ke adhyayan ko nimna teen bhaagon main baanta he- The nature of fatigue can be understood as follows- jin kaaryon ke sampadan hetu maansik shaktiyon kaa upyog hota he, un kaaryon ko lagaataar karte rahane se aisi avasthaa aati he
 When the mental powers begin to decline, the production of work starts decreasing and in the end there is an anorexia towards work
 isi avasthaa ko thakaan kaha jaataa he
 Mental energy is expended in mental tasks
 isse vyakti or adhik kaary nahin kar paata he
 The work capacity of each person also varies due to individual differences
 jin vyaktiyon main ucch prerana, kaam karne kipratigya or uddeshy ko praapt karne kii prabal ichha jin vyaktiyon main hoti he, unhen jaldi hi thakaan kaa anubhav nahin hota
 Similarly, the feeling of fatigue is less in some unusual circumstances

 Fatigue is a serious problem in the industry
 isse udyog ke anek paksh prabhavit hote ho
 The main aspects of these are - lack of production, wastage of material, possibility of accidents
 thakaan karmchaaree kii ek shaareerik evam maansik avasthaa hoti he
 There is loss of work forces
 is avasthaa ko utpann karne vaale kuch tatva, dashaaen evam paristhitiyaan hoti hai, jinhen 'thakaan kaa kaaran' mana jaataa he
 These reasons are: udyog main jin kaarnon se thakaan utpann hoti he yadi unheen kaarnon kaa niraakaran kiya jaae to karmchaaree thakaan se batch saktaa he
 This is the best solution
 thakaan dur karne ke upaay sankshep main nimna prakaar hai- Fatigue remedies can be implemented only when appropriate methods are used to measure fatigue

 in pareekshanon main ‘hast-shakti maapan yantra’, ‘paara-shakti maapan yantra’, ‘jal-shakti maapan yantra’ aadi pramukh hai
 Through this, the pulse speed, amount and speed of oxygen and various skin sensations are measured during fatigue

 It also measures the body's state of vibration and restlessness
 in pareekshanon dwaara rakt sanchaar, mel-mutr, laar aadi kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 Through them all mental reactions are studied

 They are most commonly used in industrial conditions

 They can be made suitable by means of caution

 The most common way of doing this is to take a working heart out of the body of a dead person who wanted to donate his heart and put it in the body of the patient, in this process, the patient's heart is removed in the normal process or It is left to support the donor, this is what we call the heterotopic process, the most controversial solution to overcome this complex disease of human
 The survival period after the operation is now an average of 15 years

 Once the donor heart inspection is passed, the patient is taken to the operating room and is given anesthetic medication
 He is taken in an orthotopic or heterotopic procedure, depending on the condition of the donor and the patient

 jab nayaa dil chaalu hota he tab marij ko cardeopulmonary bypass se chhudaaya jaataa he or sine ko band kiya jaataa he
 In the heterotopic procedure, the patient's heart is not removed until the donor's heart is transplanted
 The position of the new heart is such that the blood vessels of the heart and the blood vessels of the two hearts can be connected so that an effective connected heart can be formed
 This procedure gives the patient's heart a chance to be cured and if the donor's heart fails due to rejection then it is removed
 Give the patient's heart a chance to work
 Heterotopic procedure is done only when The donor's heart is not so strong that he can work himself
 Once the patient is discharged from the hospital, then he has to come to the hospital again and again for regular treatment

 Since the Vagus nerve breaks during operation, the new heart beats about 100 times in a minute until the nerve is connected

 Subsequent surgical complications include infection, sepsis, organ rejection, as well as side-effects of immunosuppressive medication
 Since the transplanted heart originates from an organism, there may be an attempt to reject it for the recipient's immune system

 Computing means a feed aggregator, called a feed reader, news reader, or aggregator, is a desktop or web application that compiles syndicated drafts, such as news headlines, blogs, podcasts, and blogs, all in one place, on the Internet
 Displays it
 chunki is saamagree main badlaav yaa adhyatan hota rahata hai atah sankalak yani agrigater ko lagaatar masaude kii kshamal feed par nazar rakhni padati he
 In this article the word compiler is used for aggregator, but keep in mind that it is not a standard term
 jis sindicated masaude ko sankalak grahan karata he vah saamanytah aresas yaa anya kisi kshamal praaroop jaise ardf yaa atom main muhaiyaa karaayaa jaataa he
 The compiler saves the time and labor spent on locating new content on websites, and in a way makes it a personal newspaper for the reader to present
 ek baar kisi feed ko sabsakraib karne yaa niyamit pathak ban jane par sankalak prayogkarta kii icchaanusaar tay antaraal par nai saamagree kaa pataa lagaakar us tak saamagree pahunchaa detaa he
 This technique is called bridge technology
 yah email yaa instent miseging jaise sadhano main prayukt push taknalaji se thik ulat yukti he
 Also, with push technology, the compiler can easily unsubscribe from any feed as compared to the subscribers of the content, ie it can refuse to be a reader
 zyaadaatar sankalak prayokta ko uske yaa anya pathakon dwaara padhe ja rahe feed kii suchi opiemail praaroop main niryaat va aayaat karne kii suvidha bhi dete hai
 In many portal web sites, compilation is available on the website itself, such as My Yahoo or i Google
 yah suvidha aadhunik web brouzaron va email kaaryakramon par bhi uplabdh he
 The compiler encapsulates the draft and serves it on a single browser or desktop application
 in anuprayogon ko aresas reader, feed reader, feed agrigater, news reader yaa search agrigater bhi kaha jaataa he
 Compilers that have the capability of podcasting can also automatically download or download media files such as MP3 recording
 kuch maamalon main to ye in filon ko computer se jude ypod jaise portable media playeron main sidhe lod bhi kar saktaa he
 Recently some new compilers, also being called "RSS Narrator", have also come in the field which not only compile feed drafts but also allow them to listen as audio recording without being connected to internet
 jaal aadhaarit sankalak aise anuprayog hai jo duurastha sarwar par sthit hote hai or jinka google reader yaa blogalins jaise jaal anuprayogon ke sahare prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since these applications are used through the Internet, the user can read their subscribed feeds wherever Internet connectivity is available
 aadhunik sankalak ajaiks jaisi takneekon kaa prayog karte hai or anekon vijet ke rup main bhi uplabdh hai
 In addition to individual compilers, there are community compilers that usually compile feeds from a small community
 udhaaharan ke liye lekh ke ant main diye sankalkon kii suchi kaa prishth dekhen
 Client or desktop applications are often installed on most computers
 inkaa graphical yuzar interphes adhiktar outluk jaise lokapriy email clyant jaisaa hi hota he jinamein zyaadaatar teen panelon main masauda dikhaaya jaataa, bain ore sabsakribd feedon kii suchi, jinako samooh, foulder yaa varg rup main baanta ja saktaa ho or daayen panel main pravishti kaa masauda
 In many applications, information about new entries can be obtained in the form of ticker tape or news ticker or alert
 kai programing bhashaaon main aisi librori muhaiyaa karai jaati hai jinka anuprayog banane vaale yaa jalsthal maalik upyog kar feed pard sakate hai yaa vibhinn praaroop main unka pradarshan yaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Examples: In sepan, etc
 media sankalak, jinhen podcast kii lokapriyata ke kaaran podcachar bhi pukaara jaataa he, aisi feed ke sankalak hote hai jinamein masauda mukhyatah audio yaa video ho
 These are added to the feed as ye jaal yaa desktop aadhaarit anuprayog ho sakate hai
 They can download and play media or synchronize with an external media player like ipod
 sankalkon ke saath saamagree kii atishyata ek moolbhoot samasya he, khaas taur par yadi prayokta anekon feed kaa pathak ho
 Compilers deal with this problem differently
 prayokta ko feed ke vargeekaran kii suvidha ke alaava ve pravishtiyon ke saath sanlagn tag va kiward kaa laabh uthaate hai
 Apart from this, the way is to present the sorted content according to the interest of the user using attention profile

 Reading the monoire chart upwards on both ends, the name of "ferdinand Monoyer" can be seen
 unhone monorer chart kaa avishkaar kiya, jiskaa prayog drishy tikshnata kaa pareekshan karne ke liye kiya gaya
 He put his name in the chart; To read vertically from bottom to top from each side of the chart, one can read their name

 " karad bharat ke maharashtra rajya ke satara jile kii ek taluka he
 The city is located 45 km southeast of Satara Nagar at the confluence of Krishna River and Koyna River
 
 Karad is also known as Yashwant Nagari
 yahaan par adhiktar muslim dharm ke log rahete he saath hi bahut sankhya main masjid bhi bane hue hai
 Karad is located at a distance of about 240 kilometers from Pune

, dhari tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke nainital jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Pattipadu has a village in Krishna district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 hindu dharm main sadgruhasth kii, parivaar nirmaan kii jimmedaari uthaane ke yogya shaareerik, maansik paripakvata aa jane par yuvak-yuvatiyon kaa vivaah sanskaar karaayaa jaataa he
 According to Indian culture, marriage is not just a physical or social contract, here the couple has also been given the form of a superior spiritual practice
 isliye kaha gaya he 'dhanyo grihasthashrama'
 The Sadgrihasth is the only person who helps the society in favorable arrangements and development, and also works to create the best new generation
 vahiin apane sansadhano se brahmacharya, vanprastha evam sanyas ashramon ke saadhakon ko vaanchit sahyog dete rahete hai
 To make such a place of abode, it is necessary to re-establish the marriage as a best practice by freeing it from stereotypes and evils
 yug nirmaan ke antargat vivaah sanskaar ke paariwarik evam samuhik prayog safal or upyogi siddh hue hai
 Marriage is the sacred bond of two souls
 do praani apane alag-alag astitvon ko samaapt kar ek sammilit ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai
 In both men and women, God has given some characteristics and some imperfections
 vivaah sammilan se ek-duusare kii apurnataaon kii apni visheshtaon se purna karte hai, isse samgr vyaktitv kaa nirmaan hota he
 Hence, marriage has generally been considered a necessity of human life
 ek-duusare ko apni yogyataon or bhaawanaaon kaa laabh pahunchaate hue gaadi main lage hue do pahiyon kii tarah pragati-path par agrasar hote janaa vivaah kaa uddeshy he
 Lust has a very insignificant and secondary place in the couple's life, primarily to create that great power arising from the union of two souls, which can prove to be helpful in the development of both the temporal and spiritual life
 aaj vivaah vaasana-pradhan banate chale ja rahe hai
 The attraction of color, appearance and dress is being given priority in the choice of husband and wife, this trend is very unfortunate
 yadi log isi tarah sochate rahe, to daampaty-jivan sharir pradhan rahane se ek prakaar ke vaid-vyabhichaar kaa hi rup dhaaran kar legaa
 a situation like westernization will also come in India
 shaareerik aaksharn kii newnaadhikta kaa avasar saamne aane par vivaah jaldi-jaldi tuutate-banate rahenge
 Now the practice of choosing a wife after taking into account her physical attraction has gone on; in a few days its reaction will also be seen in the election of husband
 tab asundar patiyon ko koi patani pasand na karegi or unhen daampaty sukh se vanchit hi rahanaa padegaa
 This increasing trend should be stopped in time and neglecting the physical attraction should allow virtues and goodwill to remain the basis of marriage as before
 sharir kaa nahin aatma kaa soundayr dekha jaae or saathi main jo kami he, use prem, sahishnutaa, atmiyata evam vishwaas kii chaaya main jitna sambhav ho sake, sudhaarna chahie, jo sudhaar na ho sake, use bina asantosh laaye sahan karnaa chahie
 The success of married life depends on this custom
 atev pati-patani ko ek-duusare se aaksharn laabh milane kii baat na sochakar ek-duusare ke prati aatm-samparn karne or sammilit shakti utpann karne, uske jivan vikaas kii sambhaavnaayen utpann karne kii baat sochni chahie
 Till the time of election, the partner is not allowed to like
 jo kuch dekhnaa, foondnaa, parakhnaa ho, vah kaary vivaah se purv hi samaapt kar lenaa chahie
 When married, then there is no scope to say that a mistake has been made, so the partner should be ignored
 jis prakaar ke bhi gun-dosha yukt saathi ke saath vivaah bandhan main bandhen, use apni ore se karttavyapaalan samajhakar puraa karnaa hi ek maatr maarg rah jaataa he
 The marriage ceremony is conducted for this only
 samaaj ke sambhrant vyaktiyon kii, gurujanon kii, kutumbi-sambandhiyon kii, devataaon kii upasthiti isiilie is dharmanushthan ke avasar par aavashyak maani jaati he ki donon main se koi is kattarvy-bandhan kii upeksha kare, to use roke or pratadit karen
 Husbands and husbands declare their determination, pledge-confinement in front of these elite persons
 yah pratigya samaaroh hi vivaah sanskaar he
 On this occasion, the feelings of both of them should be deeply ingrained in their minds that they end the power of separate people and develop in the intimacy of integration
 koi kisi par na to hukumat jamaayegaa or na apane adheen-vashwarti rakhkar apane laabh yaa ahankaar kii purti karnaa chahega
 But he will do that which facilitates the partner
 donon apni ichha aavashkata ko gaun or saathi kii aavashyaktaa ko mukhya maanakar seva or sahaayta kaa bhav rakhenge, udaartaa evam sahishnutaa baratenge, tabhi gruhasthi kaa rath thik tarah aage badhegaa
 Both of them should take this fact well and take the vow of adopting this ritual for life, for this purpose, this virtue is organized
 is baat ko donon bhalee prakaar samaj len or sachche man se sweekaar kar len, to hi vivaah-bandhan main bandhen
 Before starting the marriage ceremony or by laying it on the marriage altar, both of them should explain this fact well and ask for their consent
 yadi donon in aadarshon ko apanaaye rahane kii hardik sahmati-sweekruti den, to hi vivaah sanskaar aage badhaayaa jaae
 In marriage ceremony, all arrangements related to Dev Pujan, Yajna etc
 should be made in advance
 samuhik vivaah ho, to prayek jode ke hisaab se prayek vedi par aavashyak saamagree rahani chahie, camercand thik se hote chalem, iske liye prayek vedi par ek-ek jaankaar vyakti bhi niyukt karnaa chahie
 If there is only one marriage, then the teacher can take care of himself
 saamaanya vyavastha ke saath jin vastuon kii jarurat vishesh camercand main padati he, un par prarambh main drushti daal leni chahie
 Here are the formulas
 var satkar ke liye saamagree ke saath ek thali rahe, taaki haath, pair dhone kii kriya main jal faile nahin
 After Madhuparka Pan, wash hands and remove it
 yagyopavit ke liye pilaa ranga hua yagyopavit ek joda rakhaa jaae
 For the marriage announcement, complete information about the bride and groom should be noted in advance
 vastropahaar tathaa pushpopahar ke vastra evam malas taiyaar rahen
 Place turmeric to yellow the hands in the candle, the dough is made for guptdan
 granthibandhan ke liye haldi, pushp, akshat, durva or dravya hon
 For rock climbing, a piece of stone or flat stone should be placed
 havan saamagree ke atirikt laja rakhni chahie
 For the post of the bride and groom to be kept for the ablution or a plate
 pehle se vaataavaran aisa bananaa chahie ki sanskaar ke samay var or kanya paksh ke adhik se adhik parijan, snehi upasthit rahen
 By the coincidence of all, there is constructive cooperation in the purpose of the work
 iske liye vyaktigat or samuhik donon hi dhang se aagrah kiye ja sakate hai
 Thread ceremony is done before marriage
 avivaahiton ko ek yagyopavit tathaa vivaahiton ko joda pehanaane kaa niyam he
 If the Yajnopavit has not been done, if the new Yajnopavit has been done, then the ritual of wearing a pair in place of one should be done
 acha ho ki jis shubh din ko vivaah-sanskaar hona he, us din praatavkaal yagyopavit dhaaran kaa kram vyavasthit dhang se kara diya jaae
 It is strange to wear a Yajnopavit after removing the clothes etc
 of the bride dressed for the marriage ceremony
 isliye usko pehle hi puraa kar liya jaae
 If that is not possible, then the Yagyopaveet is put on reception
 use vastron par hi pahana dena chahie, jo sanskaar ke baad andar kar liya jaataa he
 Where there is a ritual of Dwarachar before the main rites at the traditional wedding ceremonies at the family level, if it is possible to make the atmosphere of the halls appropriate for the rites, then the cases of reception and clothing and flowers can be completed at that time also
 Sit on the pedestal and greet the bride
 phir kanya ko bulaakar paraspar vastra or pushpopahar sampann karaaye jaaen
 Traditional greetings, etc
 can also be given on the same occasion
 iske camercand kaa sanket aage kiya gaya he
 At the time of marriage ceremonies performed at the family level, many times, the bride and groom side request for some secular rituals
 yadi aisa aagrah he, to pehle se note kar lenaa-samaj lenaa chahie
 At the family level, urges for Varechha, Tilak, Haridra Lapan and Dwarpujan etc
 arise in marriage cases
 unhen sankshep main diya ja rahaa he, taaki samyaanusaar unka niwarh kiya ja sake
 a brief constitution of 'tilak' before marriage is as follows- var purvabhimukh tathaa tilak karne vaale pashchimabhimukh baithkar nimnakruty sampann karen- mangalacharan, shatkarm, tilak, kalava, kalashpujan, guruvandana, gauri-ganesh pujan, sarvadev namaskara, swastivachan aadi iske baad kanyadata var kaa yathochit swaagat-satkar karen
