 For a book titled History of Malayalam Literature see History of Malayalam Literature: Parameswaram Nair
 malayalam bhashaa athwa uske sahitya kii utpatti ke sambandh main sahi or vishwasaneey pramaan praapt nahin hai
 Nevertheless, the antiquity of Malayalam literature has been considered to be around a thousand years
 bhashaa ke sambandh main ham keval is nishkarsh par hi pahunch sake hai ki yah bhashaa sanskritj nahin he - yah dravid parivaar kii hi sadasya he
 But it is still debatable whether it is a branch of Tamil, or a language that exists apart from other southern languages, developed from the original Dravidian language
 arthath samasya yahi he ki tamil or malayalam kaa rishta maan-beti kaa he yaa bahan-bahan kaa
 The task of finding the solution to this puzzle by research is the work of language scientists and they are the only ones who can solve this problem
 jo bhi ho, is baat main andeh nahin he ki malayalam kaa sahitya keval usee samay pallavit hone laga tha jabaki tamil kaa sahitya fal phool chukaa tha
 Like Sanskrit literature, we can also call Tamil literature as the source of Malayalam thirst quenching
 san 3100 isapurv se lekar 100 isapurv tak yah pracheen tamil kaa ek sthaneey rup thi
 Sanskrit was influenced by it from the first century BC
 teesri sadi se lekar pandrahavin sadi ke madhya tak malayalam kaa madhyakaal mana jaataa he
 Jains also influenced the language in this period
 aadhunik kaal main san 1795 main parivartan aayaa jab is rajya par angreji shashan purnroopen sthapit ho gaya
 The history of Malayalam literature is alive with songs
 inamen bhakthi, viraras or hasyaras ke geeton ke saath saath praudh kavy bhi vidyaman hai
 The place of "ramcharitam" is the most important among these adult works
 isaki bhashaa tamil ke itane nikat he ki chand tamil vidvan ise tamil kii rachana samaj baithe, parantu aaj yah nihsandeh siddh ho chukaa he ki ramcharitam malayalam kavy he or uskaa rachayita bhi keralavasi he
 Its theme is the story of the Ramayana of Lanka
 kerala ke chiraman naamak kavi ne isaki rachana kii he
 Researchers believe that Ramacharitam's creation dates back to the 13th century
 pehali se aathvin sadi isvi tak kii avadhi main cher rajya main, jo aage chalakar kerala bana, anek suprasiddh tamil rachanaaon kaa janm hua he
 We can take the example of high quality poems like "chilappatikaram" etc
 parantu ramcharitam ko is koti main, arthath keralavasi dwaara rachit tamil rachanaaon main ginana bhraamak hoga
 Ramacharitam was composed at a time when the spread of Sanskrit was frozen in Kerala and a mixed language called Manipravalam was developing
 ramcharitam main sanskrit ke tatsam evam tadbhav shabdon kaa prayog prachur maatra main miltaa he
 But there is a slight change in their forms due to the writing by the Dravidian letters
 saatvin sadi isvi se lekar aage kuch samay tak kerala ke saanskrithik kshetra main aryvanshaj namputiriyon kaa kaaphi prabhaav rahaa
 Most researchers are of the opinion that they had come to Kerala long ago
 inhen ke prabhaav se kerala main manipravalam naamak mishra bhashaa kaa vikaas hua
 Manipraval literature was highly confirmed between the 10th and 15th centuries AD
 isi manipraval ke madhyam se sanskrit ke anek kavyarupon kaa sankraman malayalam main hua
 We can take the example of champu poetry, message poetry etc
 "unniyai charitam", unnichirutevicharitam" or unniati "charitam" pracheen manipraval champu hai
 The creation period of Uniyacchi Charitam is the first half of the 14th century
 unniaticharitam 1350 i ke asapas likhaa gaya or uskaa rachayita he damodar chaakyar
 The author of Uniyacchi Charitam is considered a poet named Tevan Chirikuman
 unnichirutevi charitamko inhen kaa samakaleen mana jaataa he
 But there is no information in relation to which poet it is composed
 jaisaa inke naamon se vidit hota he, inaki vishaywastu kuch vikhyath sundariyon kii prashasti he
 "ushnunilisandesam" and "kokasandesam" are important in message verses
 aisa mana jaataa he ki donon kaa rachanakaal 14veen shatabdi he
 Nothing is known about the poets who composed them
 10veen or 15veen sadiyon ke bich kuch laghu manipraval kritiyon kii bhi rachana hui
 Most of these are compositions of Shringaras associated with some luxury beauties
 ilychchi, cheriucchi, uttarachandrika, kaunottara, mallinilav, marlekha ityadi nayikaon kaa varnan inamen sammilit he, "vaishiktantrm" ek vaishyaputree ko die gaye kuldharmopadesh kaa sangrah he; iskaa rachanakaal sambhavat: 11veen shatabdi he
 Bhaktipradhan compositions are also found in Maniprawal literature
 anantpurvarnanam, shrikrishnastavam, dashavatharcharitam ityadi inke udhaaharan hai
 "chandrotsavam is the creation of an unknown poet of the 15th century
 "medinivennilav" naamak ganika dwaara manaae gaye chandrotsav kaa varnan isaki vishaywastu he
 The spread of Manipraval literature inspired the creation of a scripture detailing the grammar rules and literary features of that language
 is granth kaa naam he "leelatikam"
 It can be inferred that "lilatilakam" is written in the 14th century
 yadi ek taraf manipraval sahitya kaa vikaas hota gaya to duusari taraf "pattu" naamak kavyashakha kii bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 As mentioned above, this branch has many folk songs related to religious and farming and other professions
 toram pattu, sarpam pattu, ayyapp, pattu ityadi kaa sambandh aachaar maryaadaaon or dharmik vishyon se he
 Krishippattu, Aarurpattu, Vallappattu etc
 fall into the second category
 in geeton ke mul ghatak hai--swar, taal or lay
 Adult songs are different from folk songs
 uparilikhit "ramcharitam" hi is vibhaag main sarvapratham ullekhneey he
 The definition given for adult pattu poetry in Lilatilakam fits well in this
 baad main likhe gaye "niranam" geeton main prayukt shabd keval dravid aksharon ke bane hue nahin hai
 There are a lot of Sanskrit terms in them, which shows that by this time adequate Sanskrit letters had been promoted
 is mat ko manyata mili he ki niranam geet 14veen sadi ke uttarardh or 15veen sadi ke purvardh ke bich likhe gaye hai
 There is no difference of more than one or one and a half centuries in the times of songs of Ramacharitam and Niranam
 phir bhi in donon ke bich kaa bhashaa sambandhi antar atyadhik spasht he
 This presupposes that although Manipraval had developed during the time of Ramacharitam, only poetry written by Tamil letters was deliberately used in this poem
 niranam kavi teen hai--madhav panikkar, shankar panikkar or ram panikkar
 Bhagavad Gita, translated by Madhav Panikkar, made the language proud - it is the first and foremost among the lyrical works composed in the regional languages of India
 isamen saat sau shlokon kaa bhashaantaran 328 geeton main hua he
 In the translation of the meaning and significance of the Gita, even the slightest has not been omitted
 shankar panikkar kii rachana "bharatmala" naamak gaankavy he
 Ram Panikkar made a brief translation of Ramayana, Bharat and Bhagavata
 yah kathan galat nahin hoga ki malayalam ko apane paanv par khadey hone kaa bal pradaan karanevaale isi kavi ko bhashaa kaa pita mana ja saktaa he--yadhyapi itihaaskaaron kii drushti main tunchatt eshuttachdan is oopaadhi ke adhikari hai; mere vichaar main kannation ke naam se vikhyath is ram kavi ko uparyukt padavi pradaan karne main eshuttachhan ko harsh hi hoga, kyonki eshuttachhan ke acharyapad ke bhi ve paatr hai
 All the above poems are retellings of mythology
 parantu pandrahavin shatabdi main aavirbhoot "krishnagatha" keval puraana kaa punrakhyaan maatr nahin he
 In this, the narrative of Krishnagatha described in the Dasam wing of the Bhagavata has been proved that the form of Sanskrit epics has appeared in the Manjari verse - one of the culminating types of dravidic verses
 at: krishnagatha ko malayalam kaa sarvapratham swatantra mahakavy maan sakate hai
 Renowned Krishnagatakar, as the poet of the seasons, interviewed the new beauty trappings by the Prakritavarnas
 sureeli ganvidha, lalit or komal padaavalee, chiranutan kalpanaayen--inke kaaran krishnagatha ek sammohankaree rachana ban gai he
 See - Tunchatu Ramanujan Ashutachchan pattu shakha kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn vibhaag "kilippattu" he
 Tunchatta considers Ashutachchan to be the founder of this genre
 isamen "kili" arthath tote kii jabaani kathakhyaan hota he, isliye ise kilippattu kehete hai
 The era of Ashutachchan is the first half of the 16th century
 is jamaane main kerala ek prakaar kii raajnneetik, saamaajik or saanskrithik shithilataa kaa anubhav kar rahaa tha
 Even today, as the divine man incarnated for the resurrection of Kerala from this degeneration, the people of Kerala still believe in ecstasy
 unhone bhakthi ke udbodhan se janata ko prabud kiya
 There are Tarak ashtutchanas from the direction of Kerala in Bhaswar Nabhomandal from devout poets like Namdev, Kabir, Chaitanya, Surdas, Tulsidas, Manikkavachkar, Kampar etc
 un sabaki bhanti eshuttachan bhi janata ko jaagrath evam udbuddha karne main safal hue
 Through short translations of these three in Ramayana, Bharat and Bhagavata, Eshutachchan found direct entry into the hearts of all Keralites
 kerali ko ek nutan garima, gambhirtha, shaleenta or swaavlamban praapt hua
 In this sense, Eshutachchan is considered the father of Malayalam literature
 ve hi aise kavi hai jo jhopadiyon or mehalon main samaan rup se samaadrut hai
 The second Bhaktipradhan ganakavya in the Pattu department is the "gyanappana" of "puntanam"
 puntanam ke anya stotra bhi lalit, komal or bhakthisudha se otprot he
 Other notable compositions of this department are some folklore and some lyrical poetry known as "vatakkan Pattu" and "tekkan Patt"
 jaisaa naamon se vidit hota he, ye geet kramash: uttar or dakshin kerala kii virgathaayen hai
 The language of the northern songs is similar to modern Malayalam, but the language in the southern songs is more familiar to Tamil than Tamil
 16 veen or 18 veen sadiyon bich rache gaye dakshini geeton main tamil kaa prabhaav sambhavat: dakshin kerala ke tamil pradeshon ke saath nikat sampark ko hi suchit karata he, na ki bhashaa ke swatantra vikaas ke abhaav ko
 The poets of the south were bilingual scholars
 manipraval andolan ke antargat champu kaavyon kaa doosraa charan 15veen shatabdi main pun: darshneey he
 Although more than three hundred Champu poems have been composed in this period, only the Ramayana of Punampamputiri and the linguistic etc
 of Mashamangalam Narayanan Namputiri are worthy of special attention
 punam kaa kaal 15veen shatabdi ke purvardh main athwa 16veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main hona chahie
 The period of Naishchad Champakaar is mid-16th century
 yadhyapi vikascram ke anusaar uttam manipraval main malayalam kii hi pramukhataa honi chahie thi, phir bhi in champuon main sanskritpradhan bhashaa hi apanaai gai he
 a situation arose that knowledge of Sanskrit became compulsory for most champs to understand
 is kaaran manipraval sahitya saamaanya janata se dur hota gaya
 Attakkatha is a literary department associated with choreography
 is kalaroop kaa naam "kathakali" he
 Aattakkatha is a prolific literary branch of Malayalam
 aaj kathakali ko atanrarashtriya sammaan praapt he
 Its basic literature has contributed a great deal in giving this status to this color
 17 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main koshikkot ke manaved raja ne "krishngiti" naamak sanskrit kavy kii rachana kii
 Based on this, the dance called "krishnanattam" also emerged
 isamen shrikrishna kii katha kaa aath dinon main abhinay karne kii yojana banaai gai
 Another dance form called "ramanattam" was also invented by Krishnattam
 is kala-rup ke aadharbhoot sahitya main ramakatha ko aath raat main khilne yogya khandon main vibhakt kiya gaya
 Its author is the king of Kottarakkara
 inke jivakaal ke sambandh main do mat hai
 Some consider them from the seventeenth century, others from the 15–16th century
 ramnattam main aaj kii kathakali kaa pragrup darshneey hai
 The Raja of Kottayam, whose life is considered to be the last phase of the 17th century, developed the modern form of Kathakali by revising and finishing Ramanattam
 inaki rachanaayen chaar hai--sabhi mahabharat ke upakhyanon par aadhaarit hai
 Kings like Karthik Tirunal, Ashwati Tirunal etc
 also have "nalacharitam" by Unnayi Warrier, the best work in the autobiographies
 nalcharitam chaar raaton main abhinaeya he
 Some scholars consider Unnayi Warrier to be the last of the 16th century and the first foot of the 17th century, and the second of the 17th and 18th centuries
 is pratibhavan kavi ne aattakkathaon ke liye ek amodh path kaa udghaatan kiya
 This poet is captivated by the utopian stanza-style, unpredictable Kalpavanavibhava and serious life-philosophy
 "girijakalyanm" naamak geet prabandh ko bhi kuch vidvan unnayi variyar rachit maanate hai
 It is composed in the style applied in the verses of Kilippattu
 18veen sadi ke ooshaakaal main ek mahaan tej:punj kaa udai hua--tullal-sahitya ke upgyaata kunchan nampyar kaa
 It is possible that colors like Tulla have been there before
 parantu isamen andeh nahin ki isi pratibhashali kavi ne tullal ko ek andolan ke rup main viksit kiya
 In a way, Tullal can be called a dancer
 tullal geet iskaa aadharaswaroop sahitya he
 Nampyar has taken the anecdotes of the Puranas as a story for the Tullal songs
 phir bhi varnanon main aanevaala vaataavaran puranic na hokar kerala ke samasamyik janajivan se mail khaanevaala he
 Nampyar has created a bitter satire on the personal and social perversions of the then life through mythological chronicles
 inke is parihaas kii tej dhar kaa lakshya samajasharir ke vranon kii cheer faad karnaa tha
 The highly accomplished Kavyaloka of the Satire genre is visible in Tullal literature
 is vishay main koi bhi inke samaksh nahin aata, na inke pehle, na baad main
 If the gags are to be successful, then subtle, ruthless and comprehensive understanding is expected
 yah siddhi prachur maatra main hone ke kaaran nampyar kaa hasya adarsh he
 His humor and poignancy does not stoke the flame of rancor, but only the feeling of heartfelt sympathy and human love springs
 pattu shakha kii ek anya mahatvapurn rachana 18veen sadi ke purvardh ke kavi rampurm variyar kaa "kuchelvruttam" vanchippattu he
 Initially, there was not much progress of prose literature in Malayalam
 10veen yaa 11veen shatabdi main likhit "bhashakautalium" kutiattam ke abhinay ke liye digdarshan denevaali "attaprakaaram" naamak granthparampara, 14veen shatabdi kaa "dootvakyam" gadhy, usee shatabdi kaa "brahmadpuranam" gadhy, "ambarishcharitam", "devibhagwatam" ityadi gadhy--in sabhi ko gadhy sahitya ke liye pracheen kaal kii dein maan sakate hai
 The Christian evangelists have written some prose texts in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries
 inamen "sankshep vedartham" "vedatarkam" ityadi sammilit hai
 "presentappukam" is the first travel literature
 kunchan nampyar ke baad kuch samay tak kii avadhi malayalam ke liye andhakaarmay he
 For about half a century, no light emerged during this period
 baad main swati thirunal ke yug kaa suprabhat hua
 Iyyimman Tampi Kilimanoor Koyittampuran, etc
 The authors of the autobiography found the support of Swatirirunal
 swati thirunal swayan kavi the or unhone hindi main bhi geet likhe the
 After this, the modern era of Malayalam literature begins with the period of Kerala Varma Koyittapuran
 sahityasaarvbhaum kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit is pratibhashali lekhak ke netritv main sahitya main ek navajagaran aa gaya
 Sandesh Kavya, titled "mayurasandesam", a translation of the play "shakuntalam" and a novel called Akbar are the main ones in his works
 unke shakuntal anuwaad ke saath malayalam main sanskrit naatakon ke anuwaadon kii baadh si ai
 Chattukkutty Mannatiyar, Kunjikkuttan Tampuran, Kottartattil Shankhani etc
 confirmed this branch
 samskruti naatakon kii hi tarah ke swatantra malayalam naatak bhi likhe gaye
 Bhagyeneya Rajaraja Varma of Kerala Varma also translated the texts of Kalidas etc
 inhen rajraj verma ne malayalam ko "keralapaninium" naamak vyakaran granth or "vruttmanjari" naamak chandashastra granth pradaan kiya tha
 Like his mother, he was also an inspiration and guide for everyone
 is jamaane main dwitiyakshar praapt ke pakshapatiyon or virodhiyon main jo ghor vivaad chhid gaya tha uske pravartak kramash: ye maatul bhaaginey the
 In this controversy, the first echoes of the call of "form of sentiment" of romanticism are heard
 isi avadhi main sanskrit ke mahakavyon ke anukaranon ke rup ke malayalam mahakavyon kii rachana hui thi
 Krishnagatha was followed by an epic - "srikrishnacharitam" - in Manipraval
 is mahakavy ke baad anukaranaatmak mahakavyon ke yug kaa aarambh hone tak kam se kam ek shatabdi beeti hogi
 "ramachandravilasam" of Akkatta Padmanabha Kurup, "rugmangadacharitam" and "vijayodayam" of Pantalam Kerala Varma, "umakarelam" of Ullur, "chitrayogam" of Vallattol, "keshaviam" of KC Keshava Pilla, Kittunallur Kochunshmani Kannu "pandavodayam", "raghuvirvijayam" and "raghavabhyudayam" of Vattakkumkur Rajaraja Varma, "sriyeshuvijayam" of Kattakkayam Cheriyan Mappila, etc
 of Malayalam Epic
 ye 1902 evam 1917 ke bich likhe gaye the
 The rise of novels in prose-literature also took place in the Kerala Varma era in the nineteenth century
 pratham upanyaas appu netuncati likhit "kudalata" he
 In a couple of years, Chantu Menon published Indulekha
 chantu menon ne "sharada" naamak upanyaas kaa pratham bhaag likhaa--or duusare bhaag kii rachana karne ke pehle hi swarg sidhaar gaye
 Indulekha and Sharda are still in the first category of Malayalam social novels
 saamaajik upanyaaskaaron main chantu menon kii pratibha adwitiya he
 The author of the three historical novels "martand Verma" "dharmaraja" and "ramaraja Bahadur" c v v Raman Pilla are particularly famous in the field of historical novels
 unke saamaajik "premamritam" kaa mahatv itnaa adhik nahin he
 It seems that the purpose of his life was to increase the dignity of Malayalam through historical novels
 kerala verma ke samasamyik kaviyon main bahut se rasik kavi the
 Poets like Pottottam Namputiri, Venmani father and son, Kotunallur Kunnykkuttan Tampuran, Kochurin Tampuran etc
 gave birth to a new poetic form
 ye sabhi saral bhashaa ke prayog main tatpar the
 This trend evolved into the "pachcha Malayalam" movement
 kunjikkuttan tampuran, kundur narayan menan ityadi is prakaar ke bhashaprayog main nipun the
 But sorry that the "pachcha Malayalam" movement ended prematurely
 phir bhi venmani aadi kaviyon dwaara apanaai gai kavyastylee or drushtikon ne aage ke kaviyon par apana prabhaav daalaa he
 The adornment trend of the Manipraval period found a new entry into his poetry

 hyperthyroidism yaa atigalagranthita vah shabd he jiskaa prayog galagranthi ke bheetar ke atisakriy utakon ke liye kiya jaataa he jisaki vajah se galagranthi hormone kaa aavashyaktaa se adhik utpaadan hone lagata he
 In this way, hyperthyroidism is a cause of thyrotoxicosis, ie the clinical condition of increased thyroid hormone in the blood
 yah gaur karne laayak baat he ki atigalagranthita or thyrotoxicosis samanarthak nahin hai
 For example, thyrotoxicosis may be due to ingestion of its exogenous thyroid hormone or inflammation of the thyroid gland, due to which it begins to secrete its thyroid hormone stores
 The thyroid hormone is important at the cellular level, affecting almost every type of tissue in the body
 jab avatu granthi bahut adhik maatra main hormone banane lagata he to sharir, urja kaa upyog maatra se adhik karne lagata he
 This is called hyper thyroidism or hyperactivity of the intact girth
 yah beemaari kisi bhi aayu vaale vyaktiyon ko ho sakati he tathaapi mahila main purush ke anupaat main yah beemaari paanch se aath guna adhik he
 The thyroid gland is a small gland in the middle of a butterfly-shaped lower neck
 iskaa mul kaam hota he ki sharir ke upaapachay ko niyantrit kare
 To control metabolism, the thyroid makes hormones that tell the body's cells how much energy is to be used
 yadi avatugranthi sahi tareeke se kaam kare to santoshjanak dar par sharir ke upaapachay ke kaary ke liye aavashyak hormone kii sahi maatra bani rahegi
 As the hormone continues to be used, the thyroid continues to replace it
 avatugranthi, rakt kii dhara main hormone kii maatra ko pituitary granthi ko sanchalit karke niyantrit karata he
 When the pituitary gland, located in the middle of the skull under the brain, detects that the thyroid hormone is deficient or in excess, it adjusts its hormones and tells the thyroid what to do
 thyroid hormone sharir main sabhi prakriyaaon kii gati ke ek niyantrak ke rup main kaam karata he
 This speed is called metabolism
 yadi bahut zyada thyroid hormone ho, to sharir ke har kaary main teji aane lagati he
 It is therefore not surprising that some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness, irritability, increased sweating, heart palpitations, trembling of hands, anxiety, sleepiness, thinning of skin, delicate hair, especially the upper arms and Weakness in the muscles of the thighs are included
 aant kii gadabadi bahut lagaataar hoti rah sakati he, lekin dast yaa diaria asaamaanya he

 avatugranthi jivan bhar rahata he
 With its careful management, people suffering from thyroid gland can live their life in a healthy and normal manner
 atigalagranthita ke kai kaaran hote hai
 Mostly, the entire gland over-produces thyroid hormone
 ise grevs rog kaha jaataa he
 Generally, in rare cases, a single gland is responsible for excess hormone secretion, which is called the "hot" gland
 thyroditis bhi atigalagranthita paidaa kar sakati he
 In many clinical conditions, excess thyroid hormone is produced by the functioning thyroid tissue
 manushyon main iske pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai: High blood levels of thyroid hormones can occur for many other reasons: rakt main shlashmik granthi dwaara utpaadit thyroid-uttejan hormone )) ke str ko maapna vishisht rup se sandigdh atigalagranthita kaa praarambhik pareekshan he
 a low level of TSH typically indicates that the mucosa is obstructed or "directed" by the brain to cut stimulation of the thyroid gland, leading to increased levels of T4 and / or T3 in the blood
 It seems to happen
 kabhi-kabhaar hi, ek nimna ti shlashmik kii praathmik vifaltaa, yaa anya beemaari ke kaaran shlashmik ke asthaayee avarodhan ko ingit karata he or isliye T4 or T3 kii jaanch tab bhi naidanik rup se upyogi he
 Measuring specific anti-thyroid-peroxidases such as anti-tsh-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease or per-thyroid-peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also contribute to the diagnosis
 rakt pareekshanon se atigalagranthita ke nidaan kii pushti hoti he, jo thyroid uttejan hormone str main kami or T4 tathaa T3 staron main vruddhi darshata he
 TSH is a hormone made by the mucous gland in the brain, which tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make
 jab thyroid hormone bahut adhik hota he, tab ti kam ho jaataa he
 Both radioactive iodine ingestion tests and thyroid scans characterize the cause of hyperthyroidism or enable radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism
 thyroid granthi dwaara avashoshit iodine kii maatra ko maapne ke liye udgrahan pareekshan ke dauraan khaali pet radiodharmee iodine injection kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa munh ke dwaara sharir main daalaa jaataa he
 People suffering from hyperthyroidism consume too much iodine
 udgrahan pareekshan ke silsile main vishisht rup se sanchalit thyroid scan chhaviyaan prastut karata he, jisase granthi kii ati-kriyasheeltaa kii drishy jaanch ho paati he
 Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test for characterization of this disease resulting from hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis
 yah pareekshan pranali main vishisht rup se ek duusare se jude do pareekshan shaamil hai: ek iodine udgrahan pareekshan or ek gamma camere ke saath ek scan 
 udgrahan pareekshan main radiodharmee iodine kii ek khuraaq, vishisht rup se iodine-123 yaa 123I, ko prabhaav main laana shaamil he, jo thyroid rog ke naidanik adhyayan ke liye iodine kaa sabase upyukt samasthanik he
 I-123 is almost the ideal isotopic of iodine to produce images of thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer mutation
 aamtaur par, sodium iodide yukt ek goli munh se nigal lee jaati he, jisamen iodine-123 kii choti maatra hoti he, jo sambhawatah namak ke ek dane se bhi kam hoti he

 thyroid granthi main avashoshit nahin ho sakane vaale atirikt radioiodine ko sharir mutr dwaara baahar nikaal detaa he
 Some patients may experience mild allergic reaction to clinical radioiodine and may be given antihistamines
 rogi aamtaur par 24 ghante baad radioiodine "udgrahan" kaa str waapas praapt kar letaa he, ise gale main bandhi ek dhaatu shalaka se jude upkaran se mapa jaataa he, jo thyroid se radiodharmita utsarjan ko maapta he
 This test takes 4 minutes, as long as the leverage by machine software is stored
 vishisht rup se, ek scan bhi kiya jaataa he, jahaan gamma camera se visham thyroid granthi kii chhaviyaan lee jaati hai; radiologist uskaa adhyayan karata he or chhaviyon kii jaanch karne ke baad udgrahan % kaa ullekh karte hue ek report taiyaar karata he or apni tippanee detaa he
 Hyperthyroid patients typically "ingest" a higher-than-normal level of radioiodine

 See the complete table of common range limits of thyroid function in the thyroid gland article
 hyperthirodism ke kaaran nimnlikhit hai- Large and commonly accepted modalities for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in humans include the initial temporary use of suppressive thyrostatics treatment and possibly later permanent surgery or radioisotopic therapy
 sakriy thyroid kaary ke tahat sabhi raste kaaran ho sakate hai, jinhen aasaani se levothairoxin anupuran se sambhala ja saktaa he
 Thyrosthetics drugs inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole and methimazole and propylthurasil
 Thyrostatics is believed to inhibit the iodization of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and thereby inhibit the formation of tetra-iodothyronine
 thyroid granthi ke baahar bhi propylathuresil kaam karata he, sakriy rup T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko roktaa he
 Since thyroid tissue usually contains a large accumulation of thyroid hormones, it takes several weeks for thyrostatics to take effect and the dose often needs to be titrated over a period of months, as well as regular doctor care
 And blood tests have to be done to check the results
 praarambhik upachaar main praayah ek bahut hi ucch khuraaq kii jarurat hoti he, lekin agar lagaataar ek ucch khuraaq kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahe to rogiyon main avatu-alpakriyata ke lakshan viksit ho sakate hai
 This titer of dose is difficult to perform correctly, and is why the "barrier and substitution" method is sometimes adopted
 baadha va pratisthaapan upachaar main thyroid hormone ko puri tarah se band karne ke liye paryaapt maatra main thyrostetics liye jate hai, marij kaa ilaaj is tarah kiya jaataa he jaise ki use puri avatu-alpakriyata he
 Many of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, tremors, and anxiety, are mediated by an increase in beta adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces
 vishisht rup se ucch rakt chaap ke ilaaj main istemaal kiye jane vaale beta blowers is prakaar kii dawa he jo is prabhaav ko pratisantulit kar detii he, dhakdhaki ke samvedan se judi teevr dhadkan ko kam karti he or kampan tathaa vyagrata main kami laati he
 Thus, patients suffering from hyperthyroidism can often get immediate temporary relief, as long as the radioiodine test described above characterizes the hyperthyroidism and then more permanent treatment can begin
 dhyaan den ki ye dawaaen atigalagranthita yaa ilaaj nahin karaane kii vajah se iske dirghakaalik prabhaavon kaa koi ilaaj nahin karatin, balki ye keval sthiti ke lakshanon kaa ilaaj karti hai yaa unhen kam karti he
 Some minimal effects on thyroid hormone production, however, also come from propranolol — which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, which is determined by the different isopropyl substances of propranolol
 el-propranolol beta-avarodhan kaa kaaran he, isliye kampan, dhakdhaki, vyagrata or garmi asahansheeltaa jaise atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon kaa upachaar karata he
 D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thus providing some, albeit minimal, effects by blocking the conversion of T4 into T3
 anya beta blowers kaa istemaal keval atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon ke ilaaj ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Propranolol in the US and metoprolol in the UK are often used to enhance the treatment of hyperthyroid patients
 aakraamak radio samasthanik chikitsa ke kam upyog ke liye samay se pehle surgery ek vikalp he, lekin aise maamalon main tab bhi isaki jarurat padati he, jinamein thyroid granthi badi ho gayi ho or gardan kii banaavat par dabaav kaa kaaran ho, yaa atigalagranthita kaa aadharbhoot kaaran multah cancer-sambandhi ho
 Surgery is not widely used, as the most common forms of hyperthyroidism are most effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and as the removal of the parathyroid glands and cutting of the recurrent laryngeal nerve makes it difficult to swallow and cause a large Surgery may even lead to generalized staphylococcal infections
 kuch grevs rog ke marij, tathaapi, is yaa us kaaran se dawaaon ko bardaasht kar sakate hai, ve rogi jinhen iodine se allergy he, yaa jo rogi radioiodine se inkaar karte hai, ve shalya chikitsa kaa vikalp chun sakate hai
 In addition, some surgeons believe that radioiodine treatment is unsafe for patients with abnormally large glands, or whose eyes are out of the cotter; There are fears that too high a dose of radioiodine 131 may increase the patient's symptoms
 iodine-131 radio samasthanik chikitsa main, ati sakriy thyroid granthi ke kaary ko sakhti ke saath rokane yaa ekadam se nasht karne ke liye ek baar ke liye radiodharmee iodine-131 munh ke jariye diya jaataa he 
 apadan kaarak upachaar ke liye is radiodharmee iodine ke samasthanik kaa prayog naidanik radioiodine kii tulana main adhik shaktishaalee hota he, jiskaa jaivik arddh jivan 8-13 ghante hota he
 Iodine-131, which also eliminates beta particles that are far more harmful to tissues in a limited area, has a half-life of about 8 days
 jin rogiyon par pehali khuraaq kaa asar nahin hota, kabhi-kabhi unhen radio iodine kii atirikt, badi khuraaq di jaati he
 In this treatment, iodine-131 is taken up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, making the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive
 chunki thyroid koshikaon dwaara iodine ko badi saralata se uthaa liya jaataa he or ati-sakriy thyroid koshikaon dwaara or bhi adhik saralata se uthaaya jaataa he, so vinaash sthaneey str par hota he or is chikitsa ke vyapak dushprabhav nahin hote hai
 Radioiodine ablation has been in use for 50 years and the only major reason for not using it is pregnancy and breastfeeding
 Once the thyroid gland is made dormant, replacement hormone therapy can be easily given through the mouth daily to meet the body's requirement of thyroid hormone
 haalanki, ek visham adhyayan kii tippanee he ki atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine ilaaj ke baad cancer kii ghatnaon main vruddhi dekhi gayi
 The major benefit of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it has a much higher success rate than drug therapy
 radioiodine kii khuraaq ke chayan or ilaaj kiye ja rahe rog par nirbhar, atigalagranthita ke nishchit samaadhaan kii safalataa dar 75-100% par bhinn ho sakati he
 One major potential side effect of radioiodine in Graves' patients is the development of subcutaneous hyperactivity, which requires daily thyroid hormone treatment
 kabhi-kabhi, kuch rogiyon ko ek se adhik radiodharmee upachaar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, yah rog ke prakaar, thyroid ke aakaar or di gayi praarambhik prashasit khuraaq par nirbhar he
 Many patients are saddened at first that they have to take thyroid hormone pill throughout their life
 Nevertheless, thyroid hormones are safe, cheap, and easy to swallow; And hormones are similar to the thyroid and are usually made by the thyroid itself; Generally, this therapy is extremely safe and very tolerable for most patients
 radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke parinamswaroop thyroid utak ke vinaash se, aksar kai dinon se lekar saptahon tak kii ek chalyman avadhi aati he jab radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad atigalagranthita ke lakshan vastav main or bighad sakate hai
 This is usually due to the release of thyroid hormone into the blood after radioactive iodine-generated destruction of thyroid cells containing thyroid hormones
 kuch rogiyon main, beta blowers jaise aushadhi upachaar is avadhi main upyogi ho sakate hai
 Many patients are able to tolerate the first few weeks without any problems
 aamtaur par ek choti si goli ke rup main die jane vaale radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad adhikansh rogiyon ne kisi bhi kathinaayee kaa anubhav nahin kiya
 Occasionally, a few days later, neck tenderness or throat inflammation may appear if a mild inflammation develops in the thyroid and is causing discomfort in the neck or throat area
 yah aamtaur par asthaayee hota he or yah bukhaar aadi ke saath sambhddha nahin he
 Women who breastfeed after radioactive iodine treatment should stop breastfeeding for at least one week, and possibly longer, because some amount of radioactive iodine is found in breast milk even after several weeks of radioactive iodine treatment

 The use of large doses of radioiodine reduces the incidence of treatment failure, mostly as a result of high response rates to treatment, resulting in higher rates of thyroid dysfunction, which have to be treated throughout the life of the hormone

 In veterinary medicine, hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine conditions affecting older domesticated cats

 The most common manifesting symptoms are: rapid weight loss, rapid heartbeat rate, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperpigmentation and increased food intake, and increased urine output
 Other symptoms include hyperactivity, potential aggression, heart murmur, gallop rhythm, frayed form and large and thick nails
 Approximately 70% of afflicted cats have enlarged thyroid glands

 Radioiodine treatments and surgery often correct hyperthyroidism

 However, radioiodine treatment for cats is not available in all areas
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is ilaaj ke liye parmaanu radiodharmee visheshgyata or suvidhaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki radiodharmee upachaar ke baad anek dinon tak jaanwaron ke mutr, pasinaa, laar or mel radiodharmee rahete hai, so aam taur par kul teen saptaah ke liye unhen antarang rogi kii tarah aspataal main rakhana jaruri hota he or uski suvidhaon kii jarurat hoti he

 in deshon main in granthon ko prakritik niyam dene vaala granth mana jaataa tha or raajaaon se apeksha kii jaati thi ki ve inke anusaar aacharan karenge
 These texts were copied, translated, and incorporated into local laws
 'bible in india' naamak granth mem lui jacoliot likhte hai: Newly researched scholars have given enough thought to the period and prophet of Manusmriti
 kisi kaa mat he ki "maanav" charan main prokt hone ke kaaran is smriti kaa naam manusmriti padaa
 Some say that before Manusmriti, there was a 'manav Dharmasutra', by whose shelter someone created an original Manusmriti which later became acclaimed and became prevalent in the present form
 manusmriti ke anek mat yaa vaakya jo nirukt, mahabharat aadi pracheen granthon main nahin milte hai, unke hetu par vichaar karne par bhi kai uttar pratibhasith hote hai
 Schooler, Pandurang Vaman Kane, etc
, have given sufficient discussion of many such facts
 yah anumaan bahut kuch tarksangat prathit hota he ki manu ke naam se dharamshastreey vishay parak vaakya samaaj main prachlit the, jinka nirdesh mahabharat aadi main he tathaa jin vachanon kaa aashray lekar vartmaan manusanhita banaai gai, saath hi prasiddhi ke liye bhrigu naamak pracheen rishi kaa naam uske saath jod diya gaya
 Even before Manu was a theologian, it has been known only by the words "ete" of Manu
 kautilya ne "maanvaah" kaa ullekh kiya he
 According to scholars, even though the antiquity of the Manu tradition, the present Manusmriti cannot be ancient from the fourth century BCE, it is known from the instructions of the castes of Yavan, Shaka, Kamboj, China etc
 yah bhi nishchit he ki smriti kaa vartmaan rup dwitiya shatee isa purv tak drudh ho gaya tha or is kaal ke baad isamen koi sanskaar nahin kiya gaya
 Manusmriti is the encyclopedia of the Indian Code of Ethics, Manusmriti has twelve chapters and two thousand five hundred verses, which mention the origins of creation, rituals, daily and moral karma, ashram dharma, vardharma, rajdharma and atonement etc

 manusmriti main vyaktigat chittashuddhi se lekar puri samaaj vyavastha tak kai aisi sundar baaten hai jo aaj bhi hamaara maargdarshan kar sakati hai
 The first injury to caste and varna system based on birth has been done in Manusmriti itself
 sabake liye shiksha or sabase shiksha grahan karne kii baat bhi isamen he 
 There are also things like worshiping women, ie giving them maximum respect, never giving them mourning, always keeping them happy and giving them special rights to property
 raja se kaha gaya he ki vah praja se jabardastee kuch na karaae 
 It was also said that subjects should always feel fearless

 Many interpretations are prevalent on Manu- manu ke anek tikaakaron ke naam gyaat hai, jinaki tikaayen ab lupt ho gai hai, yatha- asahaay, bhartruyagy, yajva, upaadhyaay ruju, vishnuswami, udaikar, bhaaruchi yaa bhaguri, bhojdev dharnidhar aadi
 After the Vedas in India, 'manusmriti' is the most recognized and practiced
 isamen chaaron varnon, chaaron ashramon, solah sanskaron tathaa sristi utpatti ke atirikt rajya kii vyavastha, raja ke kartavya, bhaanti-bhaanti ke vivaadon, sena kaa prabandh aadi un sabhi vishyon par paraamarsh diya gaya he jo ki maanav maatr ke jivan main ghatit hone sambhav hai yah sab dharm-vyavastha veda par aadhaarit he
 The history-mythology about the life of Manu Maharaj and his creation is not clear
 tathaapi sabhi ek swar se sweekaar karte hai ki manu adipurush the or unka yah shaastra adishastra he
 Because all beliefs of Manu, along with being true, are devoid of country, time and caste restrictions

 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki ham ek aadhunik, audyogikrut arth vyavastha vaale bharat kaa tab tak nirmaan nahin kar paayenge jab tak hamaare lakshya tej or samaveshi vikaas ke na hon
 Our industries, workers and government have to work in a harmonious environment and with a sense of participation and only by doing so will we be able to achieve the goal of fast and inclusive economic growth
 isi baat main is bhartiya shram sammelan kaa mahatv nihit he
 We all know that the previous conventions of this conference have helped in creating a sense of encouragement and participation in labor welfare
 sammelan ke is 44wein adhiveshan jo vichaar-vimarsh hoga, uske bare main ni:andeh is adhiveshan ke shandaar ricardon par aap amal karenge
 We all should be proud that our national leadership has always attached great importance to the welfare of the workers of the country and to promoting healthy industrial relations among them
 1942 se pehle bhartiya shram sammelan kaa pehla adhiveshan hua tha us samay ise tripaksheeya rashtriya shram sammelan kaha jaataa tha
 Since then the Conference has held 43 meetings and discusses current topics such as industrial relations, labor welfare and related issues
 pradhanmantri ke rup main maine sabase pehle 2005 main iske 40wein adhiveshan main bhaag liya tha
 At that time, i said that the UPA government has been committed to ensure the welfare of all workers, especially the workers in the unorganized sector
 tab se sachmuch hi hamaari sarkaar ne hamaari is patibaddhta ko amal main laane ke liye kadi mehnat kii he or pichley saadhe saat varshon main ham aisa karte rahe hai
 The National Health Insurance Scheme, which is currently benefiting from this program of more than 2
5 crore unorganized sector BPL workers and their families, has expanded the scope of work and includes construction workers, hawkers, Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Beedi workers and domestic workers have been included as beneficiaries of the guarantee scheme

 Beneficiaries of ESIC services have increased by increasing the basic facilities on a large scale and modernizing the information technology by increasing facilities for treatment of special diseases

 Our government has also taken many new measures in the social sector, which are showing good results

 According to the Indian Human Development Report 2011, the number of child workers between the ages of 6 to 14 decreased by 2 percent in 2010 compared to 1994
 1994 main yah 6

 Due to the Right to Education Act 2009 which provides for compulsory education of children up to 14 years of age, child labor practice is expected to be completely eradicated
 main samajhataa hum ki is sammelan ke vichaarneey vishyon main rojgaar or rojgaar paatrata shaamil he
 i would like to emphasize that our government is committed to creating a system of economic management that will create more employment opportunities
 lekin rojgaar ke avasar tabhi aa sakate hai jab arth vyavastha kaa vistaar ho rahaa ho or paryaapt vistaar ho rahaa ho
 During the last few years we have been successful in accelerating the rate of growth
 Our ambition is that the workers and industry owners of the country work together so that at least 9 percent rate of growth can be achieved
 aisi vikaas dar ke saath ham ummid kar sakate hai ki desh garibi, agyaan or rogon se mukti paa sakegaa jo ab bhi karodon logon ko apane changul main jakade hue hai
 i hope you will discuss these issues
 main samajhataa hum ki is sammelan ke agenda main ek vishay ke rup main rojgaar or rojgaar paatrata bhi shaamil he
 This is an area that i consider very important
 hamen bahut badi sankhya main un yuvakon ko rojgaar ke avasar prastut karne kii jarurat he jo har saal kaarybal main shaamil ho jate he
 Employment of youth is one of the top priority agenda of our government
 aisa tabhi ho saktaa he jab ham apane yuva varg ko un kaushalon se las karen jinaki teji se bad rahi arthvyavastha main maang hoti he
 The rapid growth of the Indian economy since 2004 has exposed the shortcomings of the skill development process
 aaj kaushal kii uplabdhta sambhavat: vah mahatvapurn baadha he jo audyogic vikaas main aade aa rahi he
 In view of this problem, we have started a skill development mission under which the availability of a large number of formally trained workers will be increased through public private partnership
 iske liye ham ek rashtriya vyavsaayik yogyata vikaas or dizin kii prakriya chalaa rahe he taaki pratyaayan tathaa sambhddha karne ke maanakon kaa paalan ho sake
 The labor market information system is also being streamlined
 pahunch ke daayre or adhigamyata badhaane ke liye kaushal vikaas main shaamil vibhinn mantralay or vibhaag aapas main samanvay sthapit kar rahe hai
 The Ministry of Labor and Employment, under the leadership of my friend Kharge, has taken the initiative to set up 1500 new industrial training institutes and 5000 skill development centers across the country in the coming three years
 desh ke charampanth prabhavit jilo main prashikshan avasanrachana vistrut karne ke liye vishesh dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 However the process of expanding skill development infrastructure is progressing slower than i thought
 hamen yadi is badi chunauti se nipatna he to nijee kshetra ko apane prayaason main or adhik sakriyata se kaam karnaa hoga
 Poor students should have a financially competent position to learn the skills and not employ them without properly understanding it
 is prakaar ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye upyukt vittiya sahaayta sunishchit karaane ke liye udyog or sarkaar ko saath milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 Our government is fully committed to the enforcement of these laws for strengthening labor laws and safeguarding the welfare of our working class

 After the amendment of this Act in 1987, the need to amend the Factory Act was felt in view of many changes
 isamen bhopal traasadee se upji chintaaon khaastaur par audyogic aapadaaon main kami laane, audyogic shramikon or anya prabhavit vyaktiyon ke punarvaas or muaavze se sambandhit chintaaen shaamil hai
 This act is also being amended for confirmation of some drafts of the International Labor Organization
 kai baar yah vichaar jaahir kiya jaataa he ki bhartiya shram nitiyaan sangathit kshetra main rojgaar vistaar ke viruddh anaavashyak rup se maujuuda karyrat shramikon ke hiton kaa sangrakshan karti hai
 However in recent years, this ideology is getting clouded as more and more state governments are adopting a flexible approach to the renovation and reorganization of the labor sector
 hamaari sarkaar hamaare shramikon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye patibaddh he, hamen samay-samay par yah bhi dhyaan dete rahanaa chahie ki kya hamaare niamak dhaanche kaa kuch hissaa shram kalyaan main yogadan die bagaiyr bevajaah rojgaar, udhyam or udyog main baadha daal rahaa
 Before concluding my address, i would like to mention two important issues which according to me is very important
 mahilaayein hamaare desh kaa vah hissaa hai jinka thik prakaar se upyog nahin hua he
 The female labor force participation rate in our country is quite slow and has been almost the same in the last few decades
 adhik mahilaon ko kaary bal main laane ke liye yah jaruri he ki ham unki baadhaon ko samajhe jo unhen parivaar or kaam ke daayitv ke bich santulan sthapit karne main pesh aati he
 Although the provision for the establishment of crèches has been included in our regulations including MNREGA, but clearly this is not enough
 hamen ansh-kaaleen kaam ke liye bhi praavdhaan karne kii zaroorat he jiske lakshan purnakalik rojgaar ke samaan ho
 For this, if a change in the law is needed, then we have to be ready for it and to make it a reality, work should be started on its roadmap
 anya mudda jise main uthaanaa chaahunga vah he kaam ke silsile main ek sthaan par duusare sthaan par jane vaale shramik
 Our system is not currently strong enough to ensure the welfare and betterment of such workers
 is silsile main hamen apane gyaan, vivek or anubhav ke saath ise majboot karne kii zaroorat he
 In this context, Aadhaar number can prove to be an important system for the portability of migrant workers' rights
 meri utkar aashaa he ki is sammelan main aapaki charchaaen laabhprad or sarthak hongi
 My best wishes for your outstanding work in carrying forward the work taken in the last session of the Indian Labor Conference

 Mewar was the ruler of the Shishodia dynasty of Rajasthan
 tara hindu mahakavy ramayana main vanararaj wali kii patni he
 Tara's intelligence, direct-mindedness, courage and devotion to her husband have been praised in all mythological texts
 tara ko hindu dharm ne panchakanyaon main se ek mana he
 In the mythological texts, it is said about Panchkanya: - ahilya draupadi kunti tara mandodari tathaa
 Panchakanya Smritiyan Mahapakahak Nashak haalanki tara ko mukhya bhoomika main valmiki ramayana main keval teen hi jagah darshaya gaya he, lekin uske charitra ne ramayana katha ko samajhanevaalon ke man main ek amit chhap chhod di he
 The three places where Tara's character is in the lead role are as follows: - kuch granthon ke anusaar vah devataaon ke guru brihaspati kii pautri thi
 According to a legend, during the Samudra Manthan, one of the fourteen monies were nymphs
 unheen apsaraon main se ek tara thi
 Both Vali and Sushen were helping the deities in the manthan
 jab unhone tara ko dekha to donon main use patni banane kii hode lagi
 Vali stood on Tara's right side and Sushen on his left
 tab vishnu ne faisalaa sunaaya ki vivaah ke samay kanya ke dahini taraf uskaa hone vaala pati tathaa baayin taraf kanyadan karne vaala pita hota he
 So Vali Tara's husband and Sushen were declared her father
 ram ke yah aashwaasan dene par ki ram swayan wali kaa vadh karenge, sugriv ne wali ko lalakaara
 Vali came out hearing the challenge
 donon main ghamaasan yuddh hua, parantu kyonki dono bhaaiyon kii mukh tathaa deh rachana samaan thi, isliye ram ne asamanjas ke kaaran apana baan nahin chalaaya
 Finally Vali defeated Sugriva and drove him away
 sugriv niraash hokar phir ram ke paas aa gaya
 Rama this time asked Lakshmana to put a garland around Sugriva's neck so that he would not make any mistake in recognizing Sugriva during the duel and asked Sugriva to challenge Vali again
 sugriv ne kiskindha ja kar wali ko phir se dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 When Vali again heard Sugriva's shout, he could not bear the brunt of his anger
 tara ko shaayad is baat kaa bodh ho gaya tha ki sugriv ko ram kaa sangrakshan hasil he kyonki akele to sugriv wali ko dobaaraa lalkaarane kii himmat kadaapi nahin karata
 So Tara tried to warn the Vali due to fear of something untoward
 usne yahan tak kaha ki sugriv ko kiskindha kaa rajkumaar ghoshit kar wali uske saath sandhi kar le
 But Vali reprimanded her with the suspicion that Tara was taking an unfair side of Sugriva
 kintu usne tara ko yah aashwaasan diya ki vah sugriv kaa vadh nahin karegaa or sirf use acha sabak sikhayega
 It is believed that the arrow that Rama shot at the Vali was a simple arrow, that is, there were many weapons in Rama's quiver that could have destroyed the entire civilization in a moment, like Brahmastra etc
 lekin maryaada purushottam ram — jo ki vishnu kaa avatar the or sarvagyaata the — ne ek saadhaaran sa hi tir isliye chalaaya kyonki wali kii turant mrityu na ho or marane se pehle use apane prashnon kaa uttar bhalee bhaanti praapt ho jaye taaki vah shanti se praan tyaag sake or marane se pehle vah swajanon se bhalee bhaanti mil sake
 Hearing the news of Vali being hurt, Tara along with her son Angad ran towards the battlefield
 raste main use ran se bhaagate hue vanar mili jinhone use salaah di ki angad ko lekar waapas kiskindha jaakar angad kaa rajbhishek kar de or ram ke prakope se batch jaye
 But Tara carried that group of monkeys with her and proceeded towards the mortal
 vahaan ja kar wali ke samaksh tara kaa vilaap ati mahatvapurn he kyonki manushya ke alaava koi or praani apane swajan ke marane par itnaa vilaap nahin karata he
 First, Tara engages the dying person, then after that she tells Sugriva and Rama the perfect khuti
 hanuman madhyasthata karte hue tara ko dhants bandhaate hai or use darshan shaastra samajhaate hai
 It is a unique reference that Tara resolved to give up her life in Vali's funeral pyre
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki sati pratha hamaare samaaj main pracheen kaal se chali aa rahi he
 In this context, it would be appropriate to say that no ordinary woman can say the words she uttered during her mourning
 usko raajnneeti tathaa kootneeti kaa acha gyaan tha or isi vajah se vaanron ke kehane ke baavjood usne angad kaa rajbhishek na kara kar sugriv ko hi raja manonit kiya
 As no one could face his son, he accepted Sugriva as his lord
 wali ke vadh ke pashchaat tara ne yahi uchit samajha ki sugriv ko swami sweekaar kare kyonki usne angad ke hiton kii raksha bhi to kerani thi
 When Sugriva got engrossed in Rajollas and forgot the promise of Rama to find Sita, Rama sent Lakshmana to remind him of his promise
 lakshmana vaise bhi kaafii gussell the
 He almost invaded Kishkindha's capital, Pampapur
 sugriv ko apni galati kaa ahsaas ho gaya lekin lakshmana kaa saamana karne kii uski himmat na hui
 He urges Tara to calm Laxman
 tara ranivas se madonmatta nikali or lakshmana ko shant kiya
 He gave the example of Maharishi Vishwamitra that even such Mahatmas were helpless in front of sensual pleasures, then what is the status of Sugriva and also that he is not a man but a monkey
 tara ne yah bhi varnan kiya ki sugriv ne chaaron dishaao main sena ekatrit karne ke liye doot bhej diye hai
 In the Valmiki Ramayana and adaptations of other languages, it is mentioned that Lakshman, after listening to the arguments of Madanamatta Tara with half-baked nayanas, became a little silent and after that he went back after assuring Sugriva's arrival and finding Sita from him
 ramayana ke kuch kshetreey roopantaranon main yah bhi darshaya gaya he ki jis samay lakshmana ne kiskindha kii rajdhani ke rajmahal ke garbhaagrih main krodhit hokar pravesh kiya tha us samay sugriv ke saath madiraa-paan karne vaali uski pratham patni rumaa nahin apitu tara thi or bhoga vilaas main vah donon tallin the
 It is appropriate to remind here that while befriending Rama, Sugriva regretted the loss of his wife Ruma by more than the loss of his kingdom
 lekin tara jaisi sahabhaagini paakar sugriv apni preeya patni rumaa ko bhi bhul gaya
 It is mentioned in many adaptations of Ramayana that when Vali passed a long time while fighting with Mayavi and Sugriva closed a door by placing a stone in the mouth of Kandra and returned to Kishkindha and informed the ministers that If Vali is killed at the hands of Mayavi, the ministers have chosen Sugriva to be the king of Kishkindha, and Tara, apparently widowed, is younger than her husband
 His wife was accepted
 is pratha ko na to valmiki ramayana main or na hi uske kshetreey roopantaranon main paap kaa darja diya gaya he
 But when Vali comes back to Kishkindha after killing Mayavi and expels Sugriva due to anger and usurps his wife Ruma, during sugriva-rama meeting in Kishkindhand, Rama calls it a gross sin
 wali ke vadh ke baad bhi tara punah sugriv kii patni ban gai
 Perhaps the practice of multi-wife and multi-husband practice has been acceptable in the society of that period
