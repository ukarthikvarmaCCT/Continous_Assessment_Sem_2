 freedrik wiliam agast frobel germany ke prasiddh shikshashasthri the
 He was a disciple of Pastelology
 unhone kindergarton kii sankalpana di
 He developed educational toys known as 'frobel gifts'
 shiksha jagat main frobel kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 By comparing the child to the plant, Froebel spoke of the child's self-development as the first to speak out against the inhuman behavior of elementary schools and to propose a new teaching method
 usne aatmakriya swatantrata, saamaajikta tathaa khel ke madhyam se skulon kii neerasata ko samaapt kiya
 Froebel was the first person in the world to put forth a practical plan for the education of young children
 usne shikshakon ke liye kaha ki ve balak kii aantarik shaktiyon ke vikaas main kisi prakaar kaa hastkshep na karen, balki prem evam sahanubhuti purvak vyavhaar karte hue baalkon ko puri swatantrata den
 Frobel will always be remembered for bringing about this kind of change in the field of education
 frobel kaa janm germany ke oberways baak naamak ek chote se gaanv main hua tha
 His mother died in childhood and his father remarried and took no interest in Froebel's upbringing
 jab frobel ko apane pita tathaa vimaata se koi pyaar na mila to vah dukhi hokar jangalon main ghoomane laga
 This created a fondness for nature in his heart
 jab frobel 10 varsh kaa hua to uske mamaa ne uski dayaneey sthiti dekhakar use vidhyalay main bheja, parantu uskaa padhai main man nahin laga
 At the age of 15, his maternal uncle sent him to a ban keeper to earn a living, he did not feel like there too
 lekin yahan par frobel ne prakruti kaa acha adhyayan kiya or is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki prakruti ke niyamon main ekta he
 At the age of 18, Froebel was sent to the University of Jena, but due to his wealth he had to leave that university as well
 iske baad usne francfort main grounar dwaara sanchalit ek skool main shikshan kaary kiya
 From his experiences, Frobel came to the conclusion that children should be given an opportunity for creative and practical expression
 san 1808 main vah pastalaji dwaara sthapit skool ‘varadan’ gaya, jahaan usne adhyayan-adhyaapan kaa kaary kiya
 In 1816, Frobel opened a school in Keelhau, but had to be closed due to economic difficulties
 san 1826 main frobel ne apni prasiddh pustak ‘manushya kii shiksha’ prakashit kii, tathaa apane vichaaron ko kriyanvit karne ke liye ‘kinder garton’ naam se blaken varg main ek skool kholaa jisko usne balak udyaan banaaya or khilaunon upkarnon aadi ke dwaara baalkon ko shiksha pradaan karnaa armbh kiya
 This school was a surprise success, as a result Kinder Garten schools were opened in different places
 san 1851 main sarkaar ne frobel ko krantikari maanakar sabhi kinder garton skulon ko band kar diya
 Frobel suffered so much that he died in 1853
 chote baalkon ko shiksha dene ke liye nai shikshan vidhi kaa pratipaadan sarvapratham frobel ne kiya
 Frobel believed that children have different virtues
 hamen un sadgunon kaa vikaas karnaa chahie taaki vah charitravaan banakar raashtra ke kaaryon main safaltaapurvak bhaag le sake
 Froebel believed that just as the entire tree is hidden in a seed, similarly a complete person is hidden in every child, that is, the child has the possibility of his former development
 isliye shiksha kaa yah daayitv he ki balak ko aisa swaabhaavik vaataavaran pradaan kare, jisase balak apni aantarik shaktiyon kaa purna vikaas swayan kar sake
 Frobel says that just as a suitable environment, a seed grows into a tree, similarly, if a suitable environment is found, the child also becomes a complete person
 frobel ne balak ko paudha, skool ko baag tathaa shikshak ko mali kii sangya dete hue kaha he ki vidhyalay ek baag he, jisamen balak rupi paudha shikshak hvapi mali kii dekharekh main apane aantarik niyamon ke anusaar swaabhaavik rup se viksit hota rahata he
 Like a gardener, the teacher's job is to provide a favorable environment, so that the child can develop naturally
 frobel kaa vichaar he ki sansar kii samast vastuon main vibhinnata hote hue bhi ekta nihit he
 All these things are going towards that unity, developing according to their internal rules
 at: shiksha dwaara vyakti ko is yogya banaaya jaay ki vah is vibhinnata main ekta kaa darshan kar sake
 Fröbel also thinks that without any interference in the education of the child, full opportunities should be given for his natural development, so that he can recognize himself, nature and divine power
 sankshep main frobel ke anusaar shiksha ke nimnlikhit uddeshy hone chaiye- Frobel has stated some principles of curriculum construction, such as- upuryukt siddhanton ko dhyaan main rakhkar frobel ne paathyakram main prakruti adhyayan, dharmik nirdesan, hast vyavsaay, ganit, bhashaa, evam kala aadi vishyon ko pramukh rup se rakhaa
 He stressed that there should be a relation of unity in all the subjects of the syllabus
 kyonki yadi paathyakram ke vishyon main ekta kaa sambandh nahin hoga, to shiksha ke uddeshy ko praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Frobel based his teaching method on the following principles - frobel balak ko vyaktitv kaa vikaas karnaa chaahate the, isliye unhone aatm kriya ke siddhanth par bal diya
 Frobel by self-action was the action that a child learns by doing it in a free, independent environment of himself and his nature
 frobel ne bataaya ki aatmakriya dwaara balak paristhitiyon par vijay praapt karata he or vaataavaran ko apane anukool banaata he
 Therefore, the education of the child should be allowed to be learned through self-action
 frobel pehla shikshashasthri tha, jisane khel dwaara shiksha dene kii baat kahi
 The reason for this is that he said that the child is more interested in sports
 frobel ke anusaar balak kii aatm kriya khel dwaara viksit hoti he
 Therefore, the child should be taught through sports, so that the personality of the child can develop naturally
 frobel ke anusaar swatantra rup se kaary karne se balak kaa vikaas hota he or hastkshep karne yaa baadha daalane se uskaa vikaas avaruddha ho jaataa he
 Therefore, he emphasized that the teacher should not interfere in the learning of the child, rather he should only act as an active inspector
 vyakti ek saamaajik praani he
 There is no existence of a person apart from society
 isliye use isliye frobel ne samuhik khelon evam samuhik kaaryon par bal diya, jisase baalkon main khelte–khelte paraspar prem, sahanubhuti, samuhik sahyog aadi saamaajik gunon kaa kis saralata purvak ho sake
 Frobel opposed oppressive discipline and said that self-discipline or self-discipline is the best discipline
 isliye baalkon ko aatm kriya karne kii purna swatantrata milani chahie, jisase balak main swayan hi anushaasan main rahane kii aadat pad jaay
 According to Froebel, the child should be treated with love and sympathy and should be given full opportunity to introspect
 frobel ke anusaar shikshak ko ek nirdeshak, mitra evam path pradarshak hona chahie
 He has compared the teacher to the gardener who helps in the growth of garden plants
 jis tarah shikshak ke nirdesan main balak kaa vikaas hota he
 Fröbel's view is that the teacher should not interfere in the child's work, but only to observe the child's actions and provide the appropriate environment for his / her development

 gufa kii sikh, jise plato kii gupha or gufa kii roopak katha bhi kaha jaataa he, ek siddhant darshane vaali roopak katha he jise unani darshanik plato ne apane prasiddh republic naamak granth main 'hamaare prakritik gyaan or agyaan' par prakaash daalane ke liye sammilit kiya tha
 The story is written as a conversation between Plato's friend Socrates and Plato's brother Glaucon
 is katha main sucraat kahata he ki kuch aise logon kii kalpana karo jo jivan-bhar ek andheri gufa kii kisi diwaar se zanjiron ke saath bandhe hai
 a fire is burning behind them and they can only see the light of the fire on their front wall
 ab yah samajho kii us aag ke saamne se kuch chizein nikalati hai jinaki parchhaaiyaan us diwaar par padati hai
 For those prisoners, only these shadows are reality and they live as the truth of the world
 plato ne kaha ki vastav main manushyon ke liye duniya kuch aisi hi he or darshanik vah log hai jo us gupha kii qaid se mukt hokar parchaiyon ke peeche kii sachai dekh pate hai
 Socrates described a situation in which the facts that people perceive as true reality are really just illusions
 usne gloucon se kaha ki vah ek gupha kii kalpana kare jisamen kuch bandi bachapan se qaid hai or unke puure sharir or sar gupha kii ek diwaar se kuch aise jakade hue hai ki ve bina sar hilaae keval apane aage kii diwaar hi dekh sakate hai
 There is a huge fire burning behind them, in front of which there is a place to move
 isapar kuch anya log apane siron par alag-alag akritiyon vaali vastuen lekar aag ke aage chalate hai
 The captives see the shadow of these things and see nothing but life
 unhen yah parchhaaiyaan hi asli chizein lagati hai
 The echoing sound of the people walking in the cave also makes them feel the true sounds of these shadows
 un bandiyon ke liye vahi vyakti samajhadaar or prashansaneey he jo yah bataa sake kii agali aane vaali parchaai kaunsi hogi
 Now Socrates said that imagine opening the chains of such a prisoner and allowing him to roam and see the real things
 yah aadmi un chizon ko pahchaan nahin paaegaa or abhi bhi yahi maanegaa ki parchhaaiyaan hi vaastaviktaa he or in chizon se adhik asli hai
 Socrates said, "now think ahead that the man should be forced to see the fire: will he not turn his back towards his familiar shadows? If someone drags him out of the cave, will he drag him But wrath will not come? If he is taken out in the sunlight, will he not provoke the shadows to be true and these new scenes untrue? " But after some time he will become free to see and see that there are shadows from the sun and slowly he will understand that he and his companions have always seen shadows which are illuminated by light
 sucraat ne ab gloucon se is mukt aadmi kii manodasha ke bare main sochane ko kaha
 "when he thinks of his old house and the definition of intelligence in that society, will he not consider himself happy and his situation pathetic? And the rewards, honors and rewards given for predicting the shadows that society brings Would he not think of praise as useless? And if he goes back there, then he will not be despised in the eyes of the society due to the habit of blind people? Gay, look, it went up and lost its sight, so it is pointless to even try to go up? If he somehow catches a man who is trying to free them up, kill him
 Don't you? " Unknown to the world behind them, this prisoner will corrupt the vision of the free man and will fear everything that he does not already know
 unhen yah mukt vyakti murkh or aksham lagegaa kyonki vah kuch der ke liye andheron main lautne ke baad thik se parchhaaiyaan nahin dekh paaegaa

 Hardy moved to London in 1862, having trained as an architect in Dorchester; There he enrolled as a student at King's College, London
 unhone royal institute of british architects or architechtural association se puraskaar jite
 Hardy never felt familiar in London

 In 1870, Hardy, who was on an architectural mission to renovate St
 Juliet's Parish Church in Cornwall, met and fell in love with Emma Lavinia Gifford, in 1874 he married her
 haalanki vah baad main patni se alag ho gaye par 1912 main uski maut se unhen gaharaa sadma pahunchaa
 After his death, Hardy went to Cornwall to visit the places associated with his love affair, Poems 1912–13 bears the impression of his death
 1914 main, hardi ne apane se 39 saal choti, apni sachiv florence emily dagadel se shaadi kar lee
 Still he did not rise from the death of his first wife and kept trying to forget his sorrow with poetry

 His funeral on 16 January took place in Westminster Abbey, which turned out to be a controversial occasion as Hardy, his family and friends wanted him to be buried in the grave of his first wife Emma in Stinsford
 However, his executioner, Sir Sydney Carlyle Cockerel, insisted that he be buried at Abbey's famous Poets Corner
 An agreement was reached and his heart was buried with Emma in Stinsford, and at the Abyss Poyts Corner
 hardi ke mrityu ke fouran baad, unki sampatti ke nishpadakon ne unke patron or notebooks ko jala diya

 In 1910, Hardy was awarded the Order of Merit
 dorchester main bochhampton or maiks get main hardi ke makaan rashtriya trust ke swaamitv main hai
 Hardy began literary service by writing poems, but he destroyed the primary works
 1870 se 1898 tak unhone kathasahitya ko samrudh kiya
 They did not see any justice or order in the operation of life and the world, according to them, a blind power used to conduct the activities of this world
 is andhi shakti ko ve 'immenent vil' kehete the - aisi chaalkalakti jo jivan or sansar main nihit he
 In his narrative Hardy intensified his attack on the world trade
 pehle upanyaason main yah apekshaakrit halkaa he
 His first available work was published in 1879, 'desperate Remedies', the second in 1872, 'under the Greenwood Tree' and in 1873 the third 'A Pair of Blue Eyes'
 agali rachana 'for fram di maiding croud' adhik praudh kriti he or iske prakaashan ke baad unki khyaati badi
 By gaining confidence, Hardy intensified his shock at the pace of the world
 is kaal kii rachanaaon main sarvshereshth hai - 'di woodlanders', 'di ritern ov di netive', 'di trumpet major' or 'di meyar ov wasterbrij'
 This was followed by two more novels in which Hardy sinks in utter despair
 aalochakon ke praharon se ghabaraakar hardi ne upanyaas likhnaa chhodkar kavita likhnaa shuru kiya
 For twenty years he wrote poetry and opened new doors of fame for himself
 kavita main bhi hardi apane vichaardarshan ko vyakt karte rahe, kintu kavitaaon main vyakt aghaton se pathak or aalochak us had tak marmaahat na hue
 Hardy said that 'if Galileo had written in the poem that the earth had turned, he might not have suffered so much
 ' kavita ko ek baar pun: apanaakar hardi apane saahitiyik jivan ke pratham prem kii ore mude the
 Meanwhile, he wrote his most important work 'the Dinasts'
 yah teen bhaagon main prakashit hui
 This composition is epic as drama
 ise bhautik rangamanch par nahin khelaa ja saktaa
 Its acting is possible only on the stage of imagination
 kathavstu napolian ke abhiyaan se sambandhit he
 This globalist was also a victim of cruel destiny
 jivan kii shakti kalchakra ko ghumaati rahati he or sadaachari tathaa duraachaari sabhi usamen pisate rahete hai
 Hardy's views are expressed very clearly in this composition
 hardi kaa parivaar angarezi carch ko maanata tha lekin kattar anuyaayi nahin tha
 He was baptized at the age of five weeks and attended church, where his father and uncle contributed to music
 phir bhi vah england kii sthaneey carch ke skool main nahin gaye, unhen teen mile dur shri last ke skool main bheja gaya
 As a young man, his friendship was Henry R
 Basto who also worked as an architect student and was preparing for adult baptism at the Baptist Church
 hardi ne dharm parivartan par vichaar to kiya par phir parivartit na hone kaa faisla kiya
 Basto left for Australia, the correspondence between them continued for a long time, but Hardy eventually grew tired of this exchange and the correspondence ceased
 iske saath hi baptist ke saath hardi kaa sambandh samaapt ho gaya
 Hardy's idea of luck in life was reflected in a philosophical conflict with God
 haalanki hardi kaa vishwaas barkaraar rahaa kintu jivan kii vidambnaaon or sangharshon ke kaaran unhone parameshwar ke bare main paaramparik isai drushtikon par sawaal uthaae: There is a mixed form of agnosticism, theism and spiritualism in Hardy's religious life
 ek baar, jab ek padri ne patr dwaara pidaa kii yatnaa ko pyaar karne vaale parameshwar kii neki ke saath milaane ko kaha, hardi ne jawaab diya, Nevertheless, Hardy often thought and wrote about the supernatural forces governing the universe, doing so in an absolute sense of pleasure rather than any conviction
 iske alaava, hardi ke lekhan se kuch had tak bhuton or atmaaon ke prati unke aakarshan kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 Despite these sentiments, Hardy remained emotionally connected to Christian worship and church rituals, especially those practiced in rural communities, had a very constructive impact on him in the early years of life and saw a plethora of biblical references in many of Hardy's novels May go
 jon hiks ke yahaan shikshuta ke dauraan hardi ke doston main shaamil the horess mal or kavi wiliam barns, dono hi padri the
 Moll had been a close friend of Hardy's life and introduced him to new scientific discoveries such as Gideon Mantel, who doubted the literal interpretation of the Bible
 Moll gave Hardy a copy of Mantel's book The Wonders of Geology in 1858, with Adelene Buckland's idea that Mantel's geological description and the "cliffhanger" section of a Pair of Blue Eyes have "irrefutable similarities"
 yah suzav bhi diya gaya he ki e peyar of blue aaiz main henri nite kaa paatr horess mal par aadhaarit tha
 No publisher agreed to publish Hardy's first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady, completed in 1867, and Hardy destroyed the manuscript, so only parts of the novel are available
 unke guru or dost, victorian upanyaaskaar or kavi jorge meredith ne unhen dobaaraa prayaas karne ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Desperate Remedies and Under the Greenwood Tree were published anonymously
 hardi ke apni pehali patni ke saath pranay sambandhon par aadhaarit upanyaas e peyar of blue aaiz 1873 main unke apane naam se prakashit hua
 The emergence of the term "cliffhanger" is thought to be a serial adaptation of the story in which one hero, Henry Knight, is actually left hanging from a cliff
 hardi ne kaha ki unhone pehali baar vesex ko apane agle upanyaas faar from da maiding croud main pesh kiya

 This spread a sense of unity in Germany
 yahi kaaran tha ki german-rajyon ne vienna congress ke samaksh unhen ek sutara main sangathit karne kii peshkash kii, par us par koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 According to the new system of German-states organized by the Congress of Vienna, they were organized as loose union and its president was made to Austria

 To overcome this obstacle, the German states combined to form the octroi union

 The decision of this association was unanimous

 Similarly, the German patriots, under the leadership of Prasha, decided to carry out the task of unification of Germany

 He wanted to strengthen Prasha from the military point of view and establish his supremacy in the politics of Europe
 vah austria ko german sangh se nikaal baahar kar prasha ke netritv main germany kaa ekikaran karnaa chahta tha
 He did not believe in meetings and speeches
 vah sena or shastr dwaara desh kii samasyaon kaa suljhaana chahta tha
 He did not hesitate to do any illegal act
 prasha kii sainik shakti main vruddhi kar tathaa kootneeti kaa sahaara lekar usne german rajyon ke ekikaran ke kaary ko puraa kiya
 To accomplish this task he fought three major wars
 in sabhi yudhon main safal hokar usne german-rajyon ke ekikaran ke kaary ko puraa kiya
 This changed the nature of European history itself
 sarvapratham bismark ne apni shakti kaa prahaar denmark ke rajya par kiya
 Two territories existed between Germany and Denmark, named Schleswig and Holstein
 ye donon pradesh sadiyon se denmark ke adhikaar main the, par iske bhaag nahin the
 Holstein's population was German, while Schleswig had half Germans and half Danes
 19veen sadi main anya deshen kii tarah denmark main bhi rashtriyata kii lahar faili, jisase prabhavit hokar den deshbhakton ne desh ke ekikaran kaa praytn kiya
 They wanted the power to be strengthened by incorporating the two states into Denmark
 falswaroop 1863 i
 main denmark ke shaasha chrishchiyan dasham ne ukt pradeshan ko apane rajya main shaamil karne kii ghoshnaa kar di
 His work was against the London Agreement concluded in 1852 AD, which is why the German states opposed it
 unhone yah maang kii ki in pradeshan ko denmark ke adhikaar se mukt kiya jaae
 Prasha also opposed this policy of Denmark
 bismark ne sochaa ki denmark ke khilaaf yuddh karne kaa yah anukool avasar he
 He was keen to establish the authority of administration over these regions
 is kaary ko vah akele na kar austria ke sahyog se puraa karnaa chahta tha, taaki prasha ke khilaaf koi vipareet pratikriya na ho
 Austria also thought it appropriate to support Prasha in this task
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki yadi prasha is maamle main akele hastkshep karata to germany main austria kaa prabhaav kam ho jaataa
 In addition, he wanted to fully comply with the London Agreement of 1852 AD
 is prakaar prasha or austria donon ne sammilit rup se denmark ke khilaaf sainik kaarywahi karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Consequently, in 1864, they invaded Denmark
 denmark parajeet ho gaya or usne akramanakariyon ke saath ek samjhauta kiya
 Accordingly, he was denied the rights of Schleswig and Hallsteel as well as Lionborg
 is samjhaute ke anusaar shlesvig or hallstin ke pradesh to denmark se le liye gaye, par is lut ke maal ke bantwaare ke sambandh main prasha or austria main matbhed ho gaya
 a lot of bitterness arose between the two over this question
 austria apni aantarik sthiti ke kaaran yuddh karne ke paksh main nahin tha jabaki prasha is prasang ke madhyam se austria ko german rajya sangh main kamjor karnaa chahta tha
 The two finally reached an agreement on 14 August 1865 at a place called Gestin, known as 'gestin-samjhauta'
 yah samjhauta is prakaar tha- The deal was Bismarck's diplomatic victory
 vah ise ek asthaayee samjhauta maanata tha, jisaki avhelnaa kabhi bhi kii ja sakati thi
 Hence it was natural to react against it later
 vastav main bismark kii ichha austria ko yuddh main parrast kar use german sangh se bahishkrut karnaa tha
 He started preparing in this direction, but the task was not easy, because Austria was an important state of Europe, and invading it could affect international relations
 atah austria ke khilaaf sainik kaarywahi karne ke purv bismark anya rajyon kii manshaa jaan lenaa chahta tha
 Thus before the war he considered it necessary to understand the possible reaction of other states by diplomatic moves
 greatbritain ke is yuddh main hastkshep karne kii sambhaavna na thi, kyonki vah ekaakipan kii niti par chal rahaa tha
 Russia was a friend of Bismarck
 usne france ko laalach dekar yuddh main tatasth rahane kaa aashwaasan praapt kar liya
 Napoleon III thought it neutral in the national interest
 usne yah sochaa ki austria or prasha ke yudhon se unki shakti ksheen hogi or us sthiti se france ko vikaas karne kaa avasar praapt hoga
 In 1866, a treaty was signed between Prasha and Italy, according to which Italy assured to support Prasha in the war
 iske badale bismark ne yuddh main safal hone ke pashchaat italy ko venesia dene kaa vachan diya
 Austria became worried after receiving the information of this treaty
 ab austria or prasha kii sainik taiyaariyaan teevr gati se chalane lageen
 Thus a situation of war was created between Prasha and Austria
 ab yuddh ke liye keval avasar dhundhane kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Finding out the reasons for the war in the Schleswig and Holstein Agreement was not a difficult task
 1866 i
 main prasha ko yah avasar praapt hua or usne austria ke khilaaf yuddh ghoshit kar diya
 Italy was supporting Prasha
 yah yuddh cedova ke maidan main donon ke bich saat saptaah tak chalaa, jisamen austria parajeet hua
 The war was concluded by the Treaty of Prague, whose terms were as follows - is yuddh ke falswaroop german-rajyon se austria kaa varchasv samaapt ho gaya
 Now the effect of the administration was established there
 is yuddh ke baad prasha ko anek naveen pradesh mili, jiske kaaran ab vah europe kaa shaktishaalee rajya mana jane laga
 Now Bismarck also became an important figure in Europe
 prasha kii is safalataa ne paroksh rup se france kii bhavi paraajay kaa sanket diya
 Thus, Prasha had many benefits from this war
 hanover, heskesal, naso or frencfort prasha ke rajya main shaamil kar liye gayi
 After this, he tried to reorganize the German-states under his leadership
 kintu dakshin-rajyon ke virodh ke kaaran aisa karnaa sambhav nahin hua
 In such a situation, it was considered appropriate that the organization of the remaining German-states, except the four South German states, be formed under the leadership of Prasha

 Epilepsy can occur to any person of any age
 bacchon main mirgee se sambandhit kuch mudde hai jo unke bachapan ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Some types of epilepsy cease after childhood
 lagbhag 70% bachche jinako bachapan main mirgee thi, bade hone par isse chhutkaaraa paa jate hai
 There are also some epileptic seizures such as febrile seizures that occur only once in childhood and never later
 manushya kii samast gatividhiyaan mastishk ke dwaara niyantrit evam sanchalit hoti he
 Electric waves flow between the brain and body cells
 isi ke kaaran ham vibhinn kaary kar pate hai
 Brain cells act like electrical switches, which automatically conduct electric currents as needed

 Due to this disturbance, a person's contact with the environment around him breaks down, changes are seen in his body and consciousness, such as - fainting or jerking, changes in his behavior and activities or any part of the body
 Like in the mouth or fingers, etc
 yon to mirgee jivan ke kisi bhi kaal main ho sakati he, parantu yah beemaari adhiktar logon main bachapan athwa kishoravastha main pehali baar shuru hoti he
 Because this stage of life is very important for the overall development of the child, it is important that its identification and prevention measures be taken immediately
 samuchit upachaar ke abhaav main mirgee kaa rog bacchon main kai tarah kii samasyaon ko janm de saktaa he jaise-shaikshanik, bhavatmak evam vyavhaaraatmak pareshaaniyaan
 a common misconception about epilepsy is that the patient always experiences fainting tremors and stretches
 bacchon main pai jane vaali mirgee kai prakaar kii ho sakati he, janhen praayah pahachaanaa nahin jaataa he
 There are several reasons to identify problems, such as: kuch udhaaharan : ek bachche main do maheene kii aayu main ek taraf ke haanth-paanv main kuch kshanon ke liye khinchaav aata tha
 Since it lived for a very short period of time and ended up by the time the mother took the child in her lap, they kept thinking the child was afraid for some reason
 par vahi baccha aath maheene kii umr tak gardan bhi nahin sambhaal paaya to use chikitsak ke paas le jaaya gaya or chikitsak ne mirgee pahchaan kar uski dawa shuru kii
 Therefore, we can see how in the absence of information, the development of the child was affected due to not being able to start treatment for epilepsy in time
 ek doosraa udhaaharan, ek aath saal ke bachche kaa he, jo kuch samay pehle tak padhai ityadi main bahut hoshiyaar tha
 For a few days, it was seen that he would be cut off from his environment for a few moments as if in the middle of the talk without stopping for a reason and then after some time he started talking from where he had stopped
 is dauraan uski aankhe ekatak rahati thim or munh khulaa rahata tha
 He used to have such seizures many times a day
 padhai main uski kamajori ko bachche kaa dhyaan nahin dena samajha gaya or bachche ko aksar daant-fatkaar padati rahi
 This trend lasted until her mother saw the program on Doordarshan about the symptoms of epilepsy
 ilaaj karwaane se ab yahi baccha pehle kii tarah phir padhai main dhyaan laga paa rahaa he
 These two examples make it clear that parents need the right information to identify epileptic seizures
 saamanytah bacchon main mirgee ke daure nimnlikhit prakaar ke hote hai: It can also be called 'big epilepsy'
 isamen baccha eka-ek behosh ho jaataa he or shuru main sharir kii tamaam mansapeshiyaan akad jaati hai jiske chalate uske munh se cheekh jaisi aawaaj nikalati he, kabhi-kabhi jeebh cat jaati he, peshaab aa jaataa he or baccha jameen par gir jaataa he
 After this, epileptic tremors or stretches occur in the whole body, and foam comes out of the mouth
 yah daura aam taur se ek-do minute tak rahata he phir bachche ko thodi der tak behoshee si chai rahati he, yaa vah so jaataa he use is dauraan thakaan lagati he sir yaa sharir main dard hota he or kamajori lagati he
 During this type of epilepsy, the child's eyesight becomes fixed in a few seconds, as if something is lost
 saath main ankhon kii palken teji se jhapakane lagati hai, putaliyaan ek taraf uth jaati he or munh kii taraf dekhne se lagata he jaise vah kuch chaba rahaa he
 If there is something in the child's hand, it may fall
 us dauraan bachche se kuch poochne par vah uskaa jawaab nahin de saktaa he, par daura khatm hote hi vah ekadam saamaanya ho jaataa he
 Often these seizures can occur several times a day
 yah jaruri he ki jin bachein ko aisa hota he unhen unke mata-pita dhyanpurvak nirikshan karen or jitani baar bhi aise daure aate hon uskaa niyamit ricard rakh doctor ko batalaayen
 During this period, the muscles stretch suddenly for a few moments
 yah khinchaav halkaa bhi ho saktaa he or jor se bhi ho saktaa he
 It can be confined in one part of the body or it can be so strong that the child suddenly falls from a jerk
 yah aamtaur se subah main sokar uthne ke baad hota he or chijen haathon se chhot kar jaise tooth brush aadi girane lagate hai
 The child falls due to a sudden decrease in the tone of the muscle
 kuch secondon se ek minute ke andar hi vah phir saamaanya ho kar chalane-phirane lagata he
 If a child suffers from such seizures too much, it is necessary that the child be put on something to keep his head safe
 aksar aise dauron ko shaareerik kamajori kaa ek lakshan maan kar dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he
 During this, tremors occur in any part of the body such as finger, thumb or any other part
 baccha jagaa rahata he or use iskaa ehsaas bhi rahata he, par chaah kar bhi vah ise roak nahin saktaa
 If it remains for long, it can spread to other parts of the body and also take the form of epilepsy
 ek anya tarah kii saral aamshik mirgee main jatke nahin lagegein or baahar se dekhne vaale ko jaldi se pataa bhi nahin chal paata he, par baccha yadi vyakt karne laayak umr kaa ho to vah shikaayat kar saktaa he ki jaise vah kuch aisa dekh yaa sun paa rahaa he jo dusron ko dikhaai yaa sunai na detaa ho
 He may also suddenly feel scared, angry or happy without any reason
 kabhi-kabhi koi baccha ajeeb si mahak kii shikaayat kar saktaa he to dusron ko pet main ajeeb sa mahasoos ho saktaa he, ulti karne jaisaa lag saktaa he
 The child may look a bit discrete and may want to sleep after a while
 use dore ke dauraan jo ho rahaa he uski yaaddaasht nahin rahati he
 Often these visits are not taken care of as child bullying
 teen maheene se teen varsh ke bacchon main yah aksar dekhne ko miltaa he
 Often, if the child is seated during this time, his head will be tilted forward, and both the hands will go out as if he is saluting
 yadi soya he to ghutane achaanak upar kii taraf mud jate hai haath or sir aage kii taraf jhuk jate hai
 Often such seizures recur frequently at certain intervals
 or yah jaruri ho jaataa he ki chikitsak kii salaah turant lee jaye
 It is important to consult a competent doctor whenever the guardian has any doubt
 kai baar chikitsakon ke liye bhi nishchit kar paanaa sambhav nahin hota kyonki ve bachche ko har samay nahin dekh pate hai
 So if you feel that the above mentioned symptoms are appearing again and again in the child, then you should note it in detail and tell your doctor
 yah baat isliye bhi jaruri he ki mirgee ke alag-alag prakaar kii alag-alag dawa hoti he, or chikitsak mirgee kaa prakaar usee samay jaan jaayegaa jab aap uski sahi jaankaree denge

 O! say can you see by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there; O! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,what is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,as it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,in full glory reflected now shines in the stream:’tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it waveo’er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, a home and a country, should leave us no more? Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution
no refuge could save the hireling and slave from the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall standbetween their loved home and the war’s desolation
blest with vict’ry and peace, may the Heav’n rescued landpraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,and this be our motto: “in God is our trust;”and the star-spangled banner in triumph shall waveo’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Oh, tell me, you can see in the light of dawn, how proud we were to welcome the last glow at sunset, whose wide strips and bright stars we saw at the top of the ramparts, at the time of the dangerous battle, How bravely did he wave? And through the red glow of the rocket, the bombardment in the air testifies that our flag was still there; Oh, tell me if the sitar-equipped flag still waved Has it been on the land of free people and the homes of brave people? tat par gahare kohre main chupe hue dhang se,jahaan dushmano kii ahamkaari fuj bhay maun main jhuk gayi he,qu'est-ce que cette brise intermittente, le long du versant,nous dévoile et nous cache ?À présent elle capture l'éclat du premier rayon de soleil,nous le renvoie dans toute sa gloire, maintenant elle brille dans le ventc'est la bannière étoilée ! Oh puisse-t-elle longtemps flottersur la terre de la Liberté et la patrie des braves
 And where is the band that swears while boasting Que les foudres de la guerre et la désolation des combatsne nous laisseraient ni terre ni patrie! Leur sang a purifié la terre qu'ils ont foulée
 Any asylum mercenaries and their slaves Cannot save from the terror of despair and despair of the grave, and the star-studded flag will be waved in triumph over the land of independent people and the homes of valiant people
 Oh ! Qu'il en soit toujours ainsi, que les hommes libres protègentleur patrie chérie des désolations de la guerre !vijay or shanti ke saath dhanya, que la patrie protégée par le cielusa shakti kaa gungan karen jisane hamen ek raashtra banaaya or sangrakshit kiya
 And we must win when our campaign is just, and it is our goal: "we believe in God"
