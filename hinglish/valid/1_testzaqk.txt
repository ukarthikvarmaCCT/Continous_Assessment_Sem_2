 Private end consumers of products and services cannot charge VAT on purchases, but the industry purchases goods and services that they purchase to provide further supply or service, which will be sold directly or indirectly to the end user, VAT Can be charged is tarah, aapurti kii aarthik shrinkhalaa main prayek str par lagaaya gaya kul kar, mulya kaa ek nirantar ansh he jo ek vyavsaay dwaara apane utpaadon main joda jaataa he or kar sangrah kii laagat kaa adhikansh, rajya ke bajaay kaarobaar dwaara vahan kiya jaataa he
 VAT was invented because too much sales taxes and charges encouraged fraud and smuggling

 Value added tax avoids the stale effect of sales tax by taxing the value added at every stage of production
 paaramparik bikri kar kii bajaay mulya yojit karadhaan ko duniya bhar main pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 In principle, value-added taxes apply to all commercial activities that involve the production and distribution of goods and the provision of services
 ek vyavsaay ke prayek lenden main maal main jude mulya par waite kaa moolyankan or ekathran kiya jaataa he
 Under this concept, the government is taxed on the gross margin of each transaction
 bharat jaise kai vikasshil deshon main, bikri kar / waite ek mahatvapurn rajasav strot hai chunki ucch berojgaare or nune prati vyakti aay, anya aay sroton ko aparyaapt bana detii he
 However, this is opposed by many sub-national governments as it reduces the total revenue collection they collect as well as some loss of autonomy
 bikri kar aamtaur par upabhoktaaon ko keval antim bikri par lagaae jate hai: pratipurti kii vajah se, waite kaa antim keemton par vaisaa hi samgr aarthik prabhaav padataa he
 The main difference is just the additional accounting that needs to be done by those who fall in the middle of the supply chain, not taking into account this lack of VAT, on each member of the production chain, their position in this chain of customers and customers
 Giving and eliminating attempts to check and certify their status is balanced by the use of the same tax
 jab waite pranali main kuch chhot ho to, yadi koi ho, jaisaa kii newjiland main GST ke saath, waite kaa bhugtan karnaa or bhi aasaan ho jaataa he
 a common economic consideration is that if sales tax exceeds 10%, then people become largely involved in tax evasion activities
 duusari ore, kul waite dar, abhinav sangrah pranali ke kaaran vyapak chori ke bina 10% se adhik ho sakati he
 However, because of the special arrangement of its collections, VAT quite easily becomes the target of specific frauds such as carousel fraud which can be very costly for states in terms of tax revenue reduction
 waite lagu karne ke liye maanak tarika yah siddhant he ki ek vyapaar utpaada kii keemat se purv main chukaaye gaye sabhi kar ko ghataate hue kuch pratishat kaa adhikaar rakhata he
 If the VAT rate is 10%, an orange juice manufacturer will deduct 10% of the £ 5 per gallon price from the tax previously paid by the orange farmer
 is udhaaharan main, santare kaa ras nirmaataa £0

 Each business has a strong incentive for suppliers to pay their taxes, leading to a higher VAT rate than a retail sales tax, with less tax evasion
 is saral siddhant ke peeche iske karyanvayan main bhinnataayen hai, jaisaa ki agle bhaag main charchaa kii gai he By the method of collection, VAT can be accounting based or invoice based
 sangrah kii chaalaan vidhi ke tahat, prayek vikreta apane utpaada par waite dar lagaataa he or kharidaar ko ek vishesh bijak detaa he jo lagaae gaye kar kii raashi ko ingit karata he
 Buyers who are subject to VAT on their sales use these invoices to obtain a credit towards their liability for VAT
 paarit bijak or praapt bijak par dikhaae gaye kar ke antar ko tab sarkaar ko diya jaataa he 
 In the account-based method, no such special invoice is used
 iske bajaay, kar kii gananaa yojit mulya par kii jaati he, jise rajasav or sweekaarya kharid ke bich ek antar ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 The invoice method is used in most countries today, the only exception being Japan where accounting is used
 sangrah ke samay dwaara, waite yaa to prodbhavan yaa nakad aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Cash based accounting is a very simple form of accounting
 jab vastu yaa seva kii bikri ke liye ek bhugtan praapt hota he, ek sanchay banataa he or rajasav ko nidhiyon kii prapti kii tithi main darj kiya jaataa he - isse koi fark nahin padataa ki bikri kab kii gai
 Checks are written when money is available to bill and the expense is recorded on the date of the check - regardless of when the expense was incurred
 praathmik dhyaan, bank main nakadi kii raashi par kendrit hota he or madhyamik dhyaan yah sunishchit karne main ki sabhi bilon kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya he
 There is not much effort in comparing revenue with the time period when they were earned, or in matching the expenses to the period when they were incurred
 prodbhavan aadhaarit lekhankan, rajasav kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya or kharchon kaa milan us avadhi se karata he jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Although it is more complex than cash-based accounting, it provides more information about your business
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako, praptiyon ko trek karne main sakasham karata he or dey 
 The accrual basis helps you match revenue to the expenditure incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports
 kisi bhi vastu ke nirmaan or bikri par gaur karen, jise ham is maamle main ek vijet kahenge
 With a 10% sales tax: atah upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne is raashi ko ekatra kar liya
 The retailer has not lost anything directly to the tax and the retailers have to do additional paperwork so that the sales tax collected by them is properly passed on to the government
 aapurtikarta or nirmaataaon par sahi praaanpatr kii aapurti karne kaa prashasnic boj rahata he or yah jaanch karnaa ki unke graahak upabhokta nahin hai
 With 10% VAT: yani upabhokta ne shunya kar yojana kii tulana main, 10% atirikt bhugtan kiya or sarkaar ne yah rakam karadhaan main ekatra kii
 The business lost nothing directly to the tax

 Note that in each case the VAT paid is equal to 10% of the profit or value added
 bikri kar vyavastha kii tulana main waite pranali kaa laabh yah he ki udyog, khapat ko, yah pramanit karte hue ki yah ek upabhokta nahin he, chipa nahin sakate 
 In the above example, we assumed that the same number of widgets were manufactured and sold before and after the introduction of the tax
 yah vaastavik jivan main sach nahin he
 The fundamentals of supply and demand suggest that any tax increases the transaction price for anyone, whether a buyer or seller
 An increase in price either shifts the demand curve left, or the supply curve shifts upward
 Both are functionally equal
 natijatan, kharide gaye saamaan kii maatra ghat jaati he or / yaa jis keemat ise bechaa jaataa he vah bad jaati he
 The above example does not include this variation of supply and demand, for simplicity and because these effects are different for each type of commodity
 uparokt udhaaharan maanata he ki kar gaiyr virupanyogy he
 Like all other taxes, a VAT, without it, deflects it
 kyonki kisi ke liye keemat bad jaati he, maal kii maatra ghat jaati he
 Accordingly, some people are made worse by more where the government gets better than tax income
 yani, aapurti or maang parivartan ke kaaran tex main hone vaale phaayde kii tulana main kahin zyada haani hoti he
 This is known as deadweight loss
 arthvyavastha dwaara kho di gai aay, sarkaar kii aay se adhik hoti he; kar aksham he
 The entire amount of government income may not be a deadweight drag, if tax revenues are used for profitable spending or have positive externality - in other words, governments can do much more than simply consume tax income
 
 jabaki virupan hote hai, waite jaise upbhog kar, aksar behatar maane jate hai kyonki ve protsaahan ko nivesh ke liye viroopit karte hai, anya prakaar ke adhikansh karadhaan kii tulana main bachat or kaary kam hota he - duusare shabdon main, ek waite utpaadan ke bajaay khapat ko hatotsahit karata he

 Defendants claim that the removal of taxation through income is an arbitrary standard and that value-added tax is actually a proportional tax and that high-income people pay more at the same rate at which they consume more
 donon hi maapan, waite ko ek pragatisheel iskar banane ke bajaay adhik pratigaami banaate hai
 The effective regressive quality of a VAT system can also increase because different classes of goods are taxed at different rates
 isliye waite adhikansh rup se ek flats kar he or vyavhaar main pratigaami ho saktaa he
 Revenue from a value-added tax is often lower than expected because they are difficult and expensive to manage and collect
 kai deshon main, jahaan vyaktigat aay kar or companiyon ke laabh kar kaa sangrah aitihaasik rup se kamjor rahaa he, vahaan waite sangrah anya karon ke mukaable adhik safal rahaa he
 VAT has become more important in many jurisdictions as tariff levels have fallen worldwide due to trade liberalization and essentially VAT has replaced lost tariff revenue

 VAT is more avoidable in some industries, particularly where cash transactions prevail and VAT may be criticized for promoting it
 sarkaar ke drushtikon se, tathaapi, waite, behatar ho saktaa he kyonki yah kam se kam kuch mulya yojan ko pakad saktaa he
 For example, a carpenter may provide services for cash to a homeowner who usually cannot claim an input VAT back
 isliye grihaswami ko kam laagat lagegi or badhai anya karon se batch saktaa he 
 The government will, however, still receive VAT for many other inputs that have been sold to the carpenter and the carpenter will be unable to reclaim VAT on these inputs

 Because exports are generally zero-rated, this is often where VAT fraud occurs

 The first companies, called 'missing traders' go bankrupt without paying

 This type of fraud originated in Benelux countries in the 1970s

 XX Member countries of the European Union are required to join

 The key issue of EU VAT asks where supply and consumption take place, thus determining which member countries will collect VAT and how much the VAT rate will be levied
 prayek sadsy desh ke rashtriya waite kanoon ko, EU waite kanoon ke praavdhaanon kaa paalan karnaa chahie jo directive 2006 / 112 / EC main varnit hai
 It explains the basic framework of a Directive EU VAT, but allows Member States little flexibility in the implementation of VAT legislation
 udhaaharan ke liye, europea sangh ke bhinn sadsy deshon main, waite kii bhinn daron kii anumati di gai he
 But according to Directive 2006 / 112 the standard rate of VAT in member countries should be at least 15% and one or two reduced rates should not be less than 5%
 kuch sadsy deshon main, kuch nishchit aapurtiyon par 0% waite dar he - in sadsy deshon ne ise, EU acesan treety ke ke hisse ke rup main sweekaar kiya hoga 
 The current maximum rate in practice in the European Union is 25%, although member countries are free to set higher interest rates
 waite jise ek vyavsaay dwaara lagaaya jaataa he or iske graahakon dwaara diya jaataa he, use "output waite" kehete hai 
 The VAT paid by one business to other businesses on the supplies received is called "input VAT"
 aam taur par ek udyog us seemaa tak input waite ko waapas vasuul saktaa he jitna iske kar yogya output par input waite manaa ja saktaa he 
 Input VAT is charged by setting it opposite to the output VAT which requires the business to be in the Government account, or, if there is an excess, claiming a repayment from the Government
 waite directive ke anusaar kuch vastuon or sevaaon ko waite se mukt hona chahie or kuch anya vastuon or sevaaon ko waite se mukt hona chahie lekin un aapurtiyon par waite kaa vikalp ek europea sangh ke sadsy desh ke adheen ho 
 The input VAT that is chargeable to free supply is not receivable, although a business can increase its prices so that the customer can effectively bear the cost of 'sticking' VAT

 The OECD responds by citing Chanchal Kumar Sharma as approving why implementing a federal VAT in India has proved difficult
 kitaab main likhaa he: "although the implementation of a broad-based federal VAT system has been regarded as the most desirable consumption tax for India since the early 1990s, such reforms will involve serious problems for the finances of regional governments
 In addition, the introduction of VAT in India in the context of the current economic reforms will prove to be the inverse dimension for India's federal system
 Has paved the way for decentralization of responsibilities, which in turn call for greater decentralization of revenue-raising power, to maintain financial accountability
 duusari ore, waite lagu karne se rajyon ko rajasav ghaataa hoga or adhik kendrikaran ke saath unki swaittata main kami hogi" Chanchal Kumar Sharma insists: "political compulsions prompted the government to present an inconsistent model of VAT" 'the Indian VAT system is incomplete' to the extent that it 'goes against the core principles of VAT'
 India seems to have a 'worthless VAT', because the reasons for which VAT receives educational support have been disregarded in the Indian style of VAT, namely: removing distortion in the movement of goods in the States; Uniformity in tax structure
 Chanchal Kumar Sharma categorically states, "local or state level taxes, such as octroi, entry tax, lease tax, labor contract tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax have not been integrated into the new governance regime which provides the basic elements of VAT Goes against that according to which there should be uniformity in the tax structure

 These stories address topics such as sensitive dilemmas in the lives of Indian or Indian migrants, such as marital difficulties, abortions, and disconnection between first- and second-generation United States immigrants
 lahidi ne baad main likhaa, "jab maine pehali baar lekhan shuru kiya tab mujhe yah gyaat nahin tha ki meraa vishay bhartiya-america anubhav tha
 What attracted me to this craft was my desire to bring the two worlds within me to the same page, which i neither have the courage nor the maturity to do in real life

 New York Times book review editor, Dwight Garner, said, "it's hard to remember when was the last time a really serious, well-written narrative - especially a book of stories - went straight to No

 " Lahiri also had a special relationship with The New Yorker magazine in which she published several short stories, most of which were fictional and some non-fiction, including The Clove Way Home; Cooking Lessons, this story was about the importance of food in the relationship between Lahiri and her mother

 Unaccompanied Earth is far from the original nature of the former because Lahiri's characters enter a new phase of development
 ye kahaniyaan duusari or teesri pidiyon kaa bhagya talashti he
 As later generations began to assimilate American culture on a growing scale and comfortably build their perspective outside their country of origin, Lahiri's stories shifted to the individual needs of those leagues

 mudrarakshas sanskrit kaa aitihaasik naatak he jiske rachayita vishakhdutt hai
 It was composed in the fourth century
 isamen chanakya or chandragupta maury sambandhi khyath vrutt ke aadhaar par chanakya kii raajnneetik safaltaaon kaa apurv vishleshan miltaa he
 This work has been composed in a different way from the earlier sanskrit-natya tradition - the author has emphasized the real marking of life-struggle in place of sentimentality, imagination etc
 is mahatvapurn naatak ko hindi main sarvapratham anudit karne kaa shrey bhaaratendu harishchandra ko he
 Thus, after him some other authors also translated this work, but the fame which was received by Bharatendu Harishchandra's translation could not be found by anyone else
 isamen itihaas or raajnneeti kaa sundar samanvay prastut kiya gaya he
 It mentions the destruction of the Nandavas, the ascension of Chandragupta, the active opposition of the demon, the political awareness of Chanakya, and finally the acceptance of Chandragupta's dominion by the demon
 isamen sahitya or raajnneeti ke tattvon kaa manikanchan yoga miltaa he, jiskaa kaaran sambhavtah yah he ki vishakhdutt kaa janm rajkul main hua tha
 He was the grandson of Samanta Bateshwaradatta and son of Maharaj Prithu
 ‘mudrarakshas’ kii kuch pratiyon ke anusaar ve maharaj bhaskaradatt ke putr the
 There are sharp differences about the composition of this play, most scholars consider it to be the creation of the fourth-fifth century, but some consider it to be a work of the seventh-eighth century
 sanskrit kii bhanti hindi main bhi ‘mudrarakshas’ ke kathanak ko lokapriyata praapt hui he, jiskaa shrey bharatendu harishchandr ko he
 The decision of Visakhadatta or Visakhadeva has not been made yet
 vaise, ve bhaas, kalidas, harsh or bhawabhooti ke parvarti naatakkaar the or prastut naatak kii rachana anumaanatah chhathi se naveen shatabdi ke madhya hui thi
 Being the grandson of Samanta Vatesvaradatta and the son of Maharaja Prithu or Bhaskaradatta, he had a direct connection with politics, consequently 'mudrarakshas' being a political drama is not an accidental coincidence, but the writer's interest in it is also rewarded
 vishakhdutt kii do anya rachanaaon- devi chandraguptam, tathaa raghavanand naatakam - kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he, kintu unki prasiddhi kaa muladhar ‘mudrarakshas’ hi he
 'devi Chandraguptaam' is mentioned by ramchandra-gunachandra in 'natyadarpan', Bhoj in 'shringarprakash' and Abhinavagupta in 'natakashastra'
 yah naatak dhruvadevi or chandragupta dwitiya ke aitihaasik vrutt par aadhaarit he, kintu abhi iske kuch ansh hi praapt hue hai
 'raghavanand Natakam' may have been composed with the character of Rama, but it has also received one or two sprinkles
 ‘mudrarakshas’ kii rachana purvavarti sanskrit-natyaparampara se sarvatha bhinn rup main hui he
 By the way, Visakhadatta was well-known in Indian Natyashastra and for this reason he has had amazing success in maintaining the unity of 'work' in 'mudrarakshas', though this achievement may have been relevant given the prevalence of event-less
 kintu purvavarti lekhakon dwaara nirdhaarit pratimaanon kaa yathavat anukaran bhi unhen abhisht nahin tha
 That is why, through the shelter of sentimentality, imagination, etc
, the plot has a realistic portrayal of the success-failure in extra-life struggle
 unhone kathanak ko shuddh aitihaasik prishthbhumi pradaan kii he, svachhndatavaadi tatwon par unka bal nahin rahaa he
 The aristocratic approach is not only visible in story-combination and character-plotting, but also their conspicuous and powerful designation is the result of this trend
 is sandarbh main yah bhi ullekhneey he ki jis prakaar mallinath kii vyakhyaaon ke abhaav main kalidas ke krititv kaa anushilan apurna hoga, usee prakaar ‘mudrarakshas’ par dhundhiraj kii tikaa bhi prasiddh he
 The story of 'mudrarakshas' is famous
 is naatak ke namakaran kaa aadhaar yah ghatana he - apni mudra ko apane hi viruddh prayukt hote hue dekhakar rakshas kaa stabdh athwa vivash ho janaa
 In this, the story of Chanakya thwarting the political moves of the demon after the ascension of Chandragupta is expressed in seven figures smoothly
 naatakkaar ne chanakya auki rakshas kii yojana-pratiyojnaon ko purna raajnneetik vaidagdhya ke saath upasthaapit kiya he
 He has given appropriate attention to the naturalness, curiosity and interestingness in organizing the play event
 tatkaaleen raajnneetigyon dwaara rajtantr ke sanchaalan ke liye kis prakaar ke upayon kaa aashray liya jaataa tha, iskaa naatak main rochak vivaran miltaa he
 The promptness of Chanakya's assistants to carry out the tasks assigned to them without worrying about interest or disinterest or free will is an excellent example of work related unity
 ghatnaon kii dharawahikta is naatak kaa prashansaneey gun he, kyonki shadyantr-pratishadyantron kii yojana main kahin bhi vyaghaat lakshith nahin hota
 Though its plot is complicated by Chanakya's description of devious tricks, the playwright has achieved amazing success in keeping it up-to-date
 isamen karyavasthaon, arth-prakrutiyon sandhiyon or vrittiyon kaa naatayashastravihit prayog hua he
 The play has been considered by the Indian masters to be five stages of story-development - beginning, effort, attainment, destiny, flourishing
 naatak kaa armbh ruchir or suniyojit hona chahie, kyonki naatak kii parvarti ghatnaon kii safalataa isi par nirbhar karti he
 In 'mudrarakshas', the story of the mentor giving Chanakya the monster's posture will come under 'prarabh'
 ‘praytn’ avasthaa ke antargat in ghatnaon kaa samavesh kiya ja saktaa he - chanakya dwaara rakshas or malyketu main vigrah karaane kii cheshtaa, shakatdas ko suuli dene kaa mithyaa aayojan, siddharthak dwaara rakshas kaa vishwaasapaatr banakar use dhokhaa dena aadi
 The playwright has described the rise of the demon by the events of Chandragupta and Chanakya's pseudo-opposition, the plan of invasion of Kusumpur by the demon, for the plan of 'attainment', but also the plans of diplomatist Chanakya
 chanakya dwaara rakshas or malyketu main vigrah kara dene or rakshas kii yojanaon ko vifal kar dene kii ghatnaayen ‘niyatapti’ ke antargat aati he
 The sixth-seventh numerals mention the acceptance of Chandragupta's amatya-post by him, presenting the background of the demon's self-surrender for the accomplishment of 'falagam'
 ukt avasthaaon kaa nirupan naatakaar ne jitani or swatchta se kiya he, vah prashansaneey he
 For the proper development of the plot, the Indian masters have also prescribed five semantics like functions - seed, point, flag, light, work
 inamen se 'pataakaa’ ke antargat mukhya praasangik katha ko prastut kiya jaataa he or ‘prakari’ se abhipraay gaun praasangik kathaon ke samavesh se he
 However, balanced development of relevant stories and official narrative is essential for the overall development of the plot
 ‘mudrarakshas’ main chanakya dwaara rakshas ko apane paksh main milaane kaa nishchay kathavstu kii ’beej’ he
 Whose expression is expressed in the statement of Chanakya in the first issue: "what does the killing of Nandas do until the demon is caught and what is Chandragupta getting from the kingdom? xxrep 4 
 It is not good for us to remain innocent in his capture
" 
 ’’ chanakya aadi kaa malyketu ke ashram main chale janaa bijnyas’ athwa beej kaa armbh he
 These events can be counted under 'bindu' - giving the demon pose to Chanakya by the master, writing letters to Shaktadas, and allowing Chanakya to make Chandandas a prisoner
 naatak kii fal-siddhi main siddharthak or bhagurayan dwaara kiye gaye prayant ‘pataakaa’ ke antargat ganya hai
 'prakari' has been organized at the end of the third and the fourth digits of the 'mudrarakshas' - the example of this reaching information in Chanakya and Chandragupta to false discord and demon
 rakshas dwaara chandragupta kaa mantritv sweekaar karke aatmasamarpan kar dena ‘kaary’ namni arth-prakruti haih avasthaaon ke antargat isi ko falaagam kii sangya di jaati he
 Bhartendu Harishchandra had also paid attention to the translation of Sanskrit-plays in addition to the original plays of 'satya Harishchandra', 'shri Chandravali', 'bharat Plight', 'niladevi' etc
 ‘mudrarakshas’ kaa anuwaad unhone 1878 i0 main kiya tha
 Prior to this, he was titled 'vidyasundar' of the Bengali version of the Sanskrit work 'chaurapanchashika', 'the hypocrisy of Prabodh Chandrodaya' of Krishna Mishra with the title 'hypocrisy' and 'karpoor-manjari' of Rajashekhar's Prakrit-work 'sattak' Had translated the title
 in anuwaadon main unhone bhavanuaad kii paddhit apanaai he, faltah inhen naatayaroopaantar kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 He has often presented the play's preface, Bharatavakya etc
 in original form
 isi prakaar shabdanuwaad kii pravriti kaa aashray na lekar charitra-vyanjana main paryaapt swatantra drushtikon rakhaa gaya he
 This is the reason that in Mudrarakshas, the basic thinking and language flow can often be targeted instead of the dryness of translation

 The distribution of salinity in the open oceans - The maximum amount of salinity in nonlinear areas is found to be 36 per thousand
 High salinity is found in this area due to high temperature, prevailing hot and dry winds, lack of rainfall and low supply of clean water
 Salinity decreases both from the nonlinear regions and towards the equator and poles
 But the amount of salinity is less in polar regions than in equatorial regions
 The reason for this is that the supply of melted water in polar regions is more and evaporation is less
 In equatorial regions, both clean water supply and evaporation are high
 Local variation in salinity distribution is also found in the coastal region of the ocean
 For example, salinity is found to be low due to the supply of clean water on the mouths of rivers like Amaze, Congo, Niger and Sindh

 There is no definite trend in the distribution of salinity towards depth
 Nevertheless, some trends of change emerge with the depth of salinity
 In the polar regions the salinity on the surface decreases and increases towards depth
 The salinity remains low on the surface due to the supply of fresh melt water

 This has been confirmed by an Italian and American researcher quoting documents from the religious ceremony of naming the infant by a church pastor from Florence
 newland kaa vishwaas he ki monaalisa ne apane pet main pal rahe bachche kii smriti va anusansha se apana chitra banwaaya tha
 His statement is that because of the thrill of new life coming into the world and the happiness that pulverizes motherhood, it is this unique and wonderful smile on his face

 In 1550, a photograph of Lisa Silkardini, the wife of a silk merchant, was named Mona Lisa by the famous biographer, George Vasari, a resident of Italy of renaissance carpet artists
 italvi main mona shabd madam ke liye prayukt hota he
 However, the woman depicted in this artwork has also been known by her other nickname Laziocande until centuries later
 us samay kii adhiktar kala-kritiyon kii bhaanti is chitra main bhi kalakaar ke hastakshar, tithi va poj dene vaali mahila kaa naam mudrit nahin he
 According to Pallanati, the houses of Leonardo's father Sir Pierre and Francisco were not far apart, but the two families had close relations
 us samay lija kii aayu 24 varsh thi
 While Monalisa's mysterious smile has remained a mystery for centuries, German art historian Ms
 Maik bogt-lairesen has claimed that the woman seen in the photograph is Ishabella, wife of Duque of Arango Prefecture, Italy
 sushri mike ke anusaar ishabela kii muskaan main dukh he kyonki liyanardo ke painting banane se kuch samay pehle hi uski maan kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Ishakella's drunken husband would often beat and beat her after getting drunk
 apni prakashit pustak ‘hu ij monaalisa ’ insearch main anekon samantaanen ginvaayi hai
 The book further states that Leonardo, who was a royal artist in the court of Duque, was very close to Isabella
 kareeb 8 varsh purv japan main daanton ke ek doctor ne yah kah kar sabko hairat main daal diya tha ki monaalisa kii rahasyamayi muskaan kaa raaj uske upree jabade main aage ke do daanton kaa tutaa hona he or isi kaaran uske upree hoth ek taraf kuch dabaa hua-sa dikhaai de rahaa he, isi kaaran uskaa ek upree hoth ek taraf se kuch dabaa hua sa dikhaai de rahaa he
 This is why Monalisa and the mysterious smile appear in the unknown when it is not really a smile but an attempt to push the lips from the tongue with its broken teeth so that the lips do not look pressed
 yah doctor pichley kai varshon se monaalisa par shodh kar rahe the
 In December 1986, Ms
 Lillian Swadze, a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories in the US, created a world-wide buzz on the basis of her research, saying that Leonardo Vinci's famous artwork Monalisa is not a mysterious woman but her own self-portrait of a painter
 art and entics naamak patrika main prakashit lekh main sushri lilian ne daawa kiya ki 1518 main laal chaak se bane linordovinci kaa aatmachitra va monaalisa ke chitra ko jab usne paas-paas rakhaa to yah dekhakar dang rah gai ki liyanardo tathaa monaalisa ke chehre, ankhen, gaal, naak va baalo main adbhat samanta he
 With the help of a computer, she was completely transformed into Leonardo when she was seen wearing Leonardo's hair, beard, and hair on top of Monalisa's face
 iske vipareet liyanardo ke chehre se yadi dadhi, bal, munch, bhave aadi hataa di jaye to liyanardo monaalisa main badal jate he
 Sword ji states that Leonardo has portrayed himself as Monalisa
 unhone iske peeche ek kalakaar kaa samalangik hona pramukh kaaran bataaya he
 There is a strong possibility that Vinci is gay and is interested in adapting bisexual themes into the artwork and due to this trend he portrayed himself as a woman and named her Monalisa

 But don't tighten the wires so much that they break
