 aseergarh madhyapradesh ke burhanpur jile main sthit ek gaanv he
 The historical fort of Asirgarh is very famous
 aseergarh qila burhanpur se lagbhag 20 kilometre kii duuri par uttar disha main satapura pahadiyon ke shikhar par samudr sataha se 250 foot kii oonchaai par sthit he
 Even today, this fort is singing the glory of its glorious past with a free speech
 isaki tatkaaleen aparajeyata swayan siddh hoti he
 It is counted among the few famous world-famous fortresses, which were considered rare and invincible
 itihaaskaaron ne iskaa 'bab-e-dakkhan' or 'kalod-e-dakkhan' ke naam se ullekh kiya he, kyonki is qile par vijay praapt karne ke pashchaat dakshin kaa dwaar khul jaataa tha, or vijeta kaa sampoorn khandesh kshetra par adhipaty sthapit ho jaataa tha
 When and who founded this fort cannot be said with confidence
 itihaaskaar spasht evam sahi raay rakhane main vivash rahe hai
 Some historians relate this fort to the place of worship of Ashwatthama, son of the heroic warrior guru Dronacharya of Mahabharata, his saga of immortality
 burhanpur ke 'gupteshwar mahadev mandir' ke sameep se ek sundar surang he, jo aseergarh tak lambii he
 It is said that on the festival day, Ashwatthama comes to bathe in the Tapti River, and later returns to his place after worshiping 'gupteshwar'
 kuch itihaaskaar ise ramayana kaal kaa bataate hai
 According to the famous historian 'mohammad Qasim', it was constructed by a person named 'asha Ahir'
 aashaa ahir ke paas hazaron kii sankhya main pashu the
 Such a safe place was needed for their safety
 kehete hai, vah is sthaan par pandrahavin shatabdi main aayaa tha or is sthaan par it mitti, chuunaa or pattharon kii diwaar banaakar rahane laga
 In this way, this fort became famous as Asirgarh in the name of Asha Ahir
 aseergarh kuch samay ke liye chouhan vansh ke raajaaon ke aadhipaty main bhi rahaa tha, jiskaa ullekh raajapootaana ke itihaaskaaron ne sandarbh main kiya hai
 After some time the fame of the Asirgarh Fort spread far and wide
 firozshah tululaq ke ek sipaahi malik khaan ke putr naseer khaan faaruqi ko aseergarh kii prasiddhi ne prabhavit kiya
 He came to Burhanpur
 usne aashaa ahir se bhent kar nivedan kiya ki "mere bhai or balkana ke zamidaar mujhe pareshaan karte rahete hai, evam meri jaan ke dushman bane hue hai
 Therefore, you help me and allow my family members to stay in this safe place, then it will be kind
 "asha Ahir was a generous person, believing Nasir Khan's word and ordered him to stay in the fort
 naseer khaan ne pehle to kuch doliyon main mahilaon or bacchon ko bhijwaya or kuch main hathiyaaron se susajjit sipaahi yoddhaon ko bheja
 Asha Ahir and her sons came to welcome
 jaise hi doliyon ne qile main pravesh kiya, doliyon main se nikalakar ekadam aashaa ahir or uske putron par hamalaa kiya gaya or unhen maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 In this way, Nasir Khan Farooqi got authority on this fort
 adilshaah faaruqi ke dehanth ke baad aseergarh kaa qila bahadurshah ke adhikaar main aa gaya tha
 He was not a far-sighted king
 usne apni or qile kii suraksha ke liye koi vyavastha nahin kii thi samraat akbar aseergarh kii prasiddhi sunakar is kile par apana adhipaty sthapit karne ke liye vyakul ho rahaa tha
 He migrated south
 jaise hi bahadurshah faaruqi ko is baat kii soochna mili, usne apni suraksha ke liye qile main aisi shaktishaalee vyavastha kii, ki das varshon tak qila ghira rahane par bhi baahar se kisi vastu kii aavashyaktaa nahin padi
 Emperor Akbar started attacking Asirgarh, and closed all the routes of the fort
 vah qile par raat-din topon se golabari karne laga tha
 Thus the order of war continued continuously, but Akbar had to face failure every time
 usne apane paramarshdaataaon se vichaar-vimarsh kiya, tab yah nishchit hua ki bahadurshah se baatcheet kii jaae
 Message sent by messenger
 saath hi yah vishwaas bhi dilaayaa gaya ki bahadurshah par kisi bhi prakaar kii aanch nahin aegi
 Bahadur Shah believed Emperor Akbar
 vah usase bhent karne ke liye qile ke baahar aayaa
 Bahadur Shah Farooqi greeted and then the conversation started
 baatcheet chal hi rahi thi ki ek sipaahi ne peeche se bahadurshah par hamalaa kar diya or use jakhmi kar bandi bana liya
 He told Akbar "this is your betrayal of me"
 is par akbar ne kaha ki "raajnneeti main sab kuch jaij he
 "then Akbar filled the fort with the gold, silver, diamonds, pearls of the fortress and soldiers with political tricks and tricks
 in lobhiyon ne qile kaa dwaar khol diya
 Akbar's army entered the fort
 bahadurshah kii sena akbar kii sena ke saamne na tik saki
 In this way, on 17 January 1601 AD, Akbar conquered the fort of Asirgarh and hoisted the flag of Mughal rule on the fort
 akbar kii sena ne bahadurshah ke putron ko bandi bana liya
 Akbar sent Bahadur Shah Farooqui to the fort of Gwalior and his sons to keep it in other forts
 jis prakaar faaruqi badshaah ne is qile ko raajnneetik chaalon se, dhoortta se praapt kiya tha, thik usee prakaar yah qila bhi unke haathon se jaataa rahaa tha
 Thus after the Mughal suzerainty was established over Asirgarh and Burhanpur, the Farooqi dynasty collapsed
 prasiddh itihaaskaar farishta likhata he ki, "akbar jaise samraat badshaah ko bhi aseergarh qile ko hasil karne ke liye 'sone kii chaabi' kaa upyog karnaa pada tha"
 After the reign of Akbar, this fort remained in the possession of the Marathas from 1760 AD to 1819 AD
 maraathon ke patan ke pashchaat yah qila angrezon ke aadhipaty main aa gaya
 The English Army resided here since 1904 AD
 aseergarh kaa qila teen vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 The upper part is called Asirgarh, the middle part is Kamargarh and the lower part is called Malayagarh
 is qile tak pahunchne ke liye do raste banaaye gayi hai
 One is in the east direction, which is a simple terraced path, and the other is in the north direction, which is extremely difficult and painful
 yah maarg vaahanon ke liye he
 Walls have been built on both sides of the roadway to protect the vehicle
 yah maarg ek badi khai ke paas samaapt ho jaataa he
 There is a big gate, which is famous as 'madar Darwaza'
 neeche se qile kii oonchaai dekhakar himmat baith jaati he ki, itani oonchaai par chadhnaa kathin hoga, parantu qile ko dekhne kii ichha, sharir ko sfoort karti he evam ek nai shakti or utsaah bhar detii hai
 As we go uphill, the natural beauty of the surrounding attracts the heart
 in sundar drishyon main qile par chadhne vaala vyakti itnaa magn ho jaataa he, ki use is baat kaa ahsaas tak nahin hota he, ki vah kitni oonchaai par pahunch gaya he
 Humans are surprised to see the maze-filled path of the fort
 qile ke is vicitra rang ko dekhte hue jab aage jaaen, to qile kaa pehla dwaar nazar aata he
 Some far east direction from this door, hidden in the long grass, two different sources of water named ganga-yamuna, whose water is very clean and sweet, no one knows where the water comes from
 pani main bani seedhiyaan spasht nazar aati hai, or aage tak rasta bhi nazar aata he
 Fear is felt when you move forward
 aisa lagata he ki yahan koi gupt maarg qile ke kisi na kisi bhaag tak avashya jaataa hoga
 In front of this door is a black rock, on which four inscriptions of Akbar, Daniyal, Aurangzeb and Shah Jahan are installed in Persian language
 in shilalekhon par qile ke qiledaron par vijay praapt karne waalon or soobedaaron ke naam ke saath anya varnan ankit he
 It is known from the inscription of Shahjahan that, during his tenure, some buildings were built here
 is chattan ke paas jo daravaaza he, use rajagopaldaas ne, jo qile kaa soobedaar tha, banwaaya tha
 Standing from here, beautiful views of the surroundings attract the heart
 qile kii deevaaron par or darwaazon par thode-thode antar se choti topein sthapit kii gai thim
 As soon as entering the top of the fort, there is a huge ground on the front, on which the grass appears to have grown
 kisi samay yahan kheti kii jaati thi, parantu ab yah vishaal maidan yun hi viraan padaa he
 Moving forward, the two towers of the mosque of Asirgarh are clearly visible
 yahi aseergarh kii 'jama masjid' he
 This mosque is built entirely of black stone
 yah bhavy masjid faaruqi shashan kaal kii nirmaan kala kaa utkrisht namoona he evam yaadgaar he
 This mosque was built 5 years before the Jama Masjid in Burhanpur
 is masjid kii lambaai 935 foot or chaudai 40 foot he
 Its roof is based on 50 pillars
 isaki 13 mehraaben or 4 dalan hai
 Its arched doors are also of stone
 yahan lagbhag 1200 aadmi ek saath aasaani se namaaz padh sakate hai
 In front of the mosque is a large terrace, on which three sides of the stone verandah have been made
 masjid ke madhyabhaag kii mehrab ke upree bhaag par arabi bhashaa kaa ek shilaalekh he, jisamen faaruqi vansh ke sulatanon kaa vansh evam masjid kaa nirmaan varsh 992 hijri ankit he
 The arches at the northern corner have a Sanskrit inscription similar to the inscription of Jama Masjid of Burhanpur
 isse masjid kaa nirmaan varsh aadi gyaat hota he
 On the front pillar, an inscription was inscribed by the emperor Akbar in Persian, which describes the victory over Asirgarh
 is shilaalekh ko us samay ke prasiddh lekhaakaar 'mohammad maasoom' ne pathar par taraasha tha
 There is a square stone platform in the central part of the mosque, with a large iron screw on it
 bataaya jaataa he ki is lohe ke darvaaze ke neeche ek gupt rasta he, jo qile ke baahar jaataa he
 This path is so wide that the horse can easily pass through it
 iske bare main yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki, yah bhumigat gupt rasta burhanpur tak jaataa tha
 The British discovered this path, but were unsuccessful
 masjid ke dalan se lage hue ek jaise do minaaren hai, jo lagbhag 80 foot unche hai
 To reach the top of these towers, a curved path is made of stairs
 masjid ke pravesh dwaar ke bai taraf ek kuna he, jiskaa pani, meetha, thanda evam svachh he
 It has an iron chain
 neeche utarane par abhas hota he ki, yahan vishaal tal ghar he
 Departing from the mosque, in the eastern northern part of the fort there is an ancient temple on the front side
 yah mandir mahabharat kaaleen ashwatthama kaa puja sthal bataaya jaataa he
 Nandi sits outside the temple, and has Shivling and idols in front of him
 is mandir main bhi ek gupt rasta bataaya jaataa he, jo qile ke baahar pehle darvaaze se kuch dur ganga-yamuna main aakar samaapt ho jaataa he
 It is possible that this secret passage has been made to enter the enemy's fortress and to attack him from behind by deception
 nirantar prakritik ghatnaon ke ghatit hote rahane ke uparaant bhi yah mandir ab tak vidyaman he
 In fact, this fort is a wonderful act of surprise for the work done by humans, which is its own example
 aseergarh ke neeche lagbhag ek hazaar kii aabaadi vaala gram he, jo aseergarh ke naam se prasiddh he
 Badanagar was inhabited here in the sixteenth century, and it was famous only for the tenancy of grapes, whose grapes were sold far and wide till 1870 AD

 Dalit literature refers to the literary movement keeping the writing on Dalit life and its problems at the center, which can be traced to the Dalit Panther

 There were long debates about the concept of Dalit literature
 In Dalit literature, the question was dominated by who can write Dalit literature, ie will self-realization be authentic or will sympathy also get place
 pramukh dalit sahityakaron ne kaha chunki savarnon ne daliton kii peeda ko bhoga nahin, isliye ve dalit sahitya nahin likh sakate
 haalanki yah mat zyada dinon tak tikaa nahin, lekin aarambh main bahes kaa mudda bana rahaa
 This question was raised more in Hindi than Marathi
 Finally, there was a view that Dalit literature is a literary movement that emerged in the decade of Assi and Nabi, in which the creators born in the Dalit society predominantly took part and struggled to get it a separate stream
 haalanki sahitya main dalit varg kii upasthiti buddha kaal se mukherit rahi he kintu ek lakshith maanavadhikaar andolan ke rup main dalit sahitya mukhyatah beesvin sadi kii dein he

 Official website maanav jivan main ahimsa evam shaakaahaar kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Ahimsa is an Anuvrat dharma for a listener, while on the other side it is Mahavrata for sages
 manushya dainik jivan charya main sookshm hinsa kaa bhagidaar ho hi jaataa he lekin sadhu kii charya ahimsaatmak he
 The purity of complete conduct is found only in Jain Acharyas, Munis and some Shravaks, whose actions and words are one
 yadi hamen charitrik vikaas karnaa he to nishchit rup se, man vachan kaay se ekarupata lani hogi
 Ahimsanuvrat: Acharya Samantabhadra Swami has written about Ahimsanuvrat in Ratnakaranandaka Shravakachara that neither intentionally committing, nor condoning / endorsing violence intentionally, by word and action is the practice of non-violence
 ang chhedan, bandhan, peedan, adhik bhaar ladanaa tathaa aahaar ko rokna ye paanch ahimsanuvrat ke atichaar hai
 Ahimsa is the pillar of Jainism
 jain dharm main praani maatr ke kalyaan kii bhaavana nihit he
 In Jainism, apart from humans, animals, birds, insects and insects, earth, water, fire, air and vegetation are also considered creatures
 jain dharm ke anusaar in jeevon ko na maarna hi ahimsa he
 Jain philosophers have called that action violence that occurs pramadically or painfully
 hinsa do prakaar kii hoti he : bhav hinsa or dravya hinsa
 The emotion is related to violence
 dravya hinsa bhav hinsa se utpann hoti he or bhav hinsa ko utpann bhi karti he
 There is a person who only commits slaughter; The second slays with emotion; And the third person slays without emotion, so there is an inequality in these three violence
 da
 mohan laal mehta ne likhaa he ki hinsa ahimsa ke nimna chaar rup banate hai: 1
 jo hinsa bhavarup bhi he or dravyarup bhi, aisi hinsa ko ham purna hinsa kahenge
 2
 Violence that is only emotional, such violence is incomplete in part
 ise apurna ahimsa bhi kah sakate hai
 3
 Violence that is only physical, such violence can be called incomplete non-violence or incomplete violence
 isamen keval pranavadh hota he
 4
 Where neither violence nor violence is material violence, the name of such a situation is complete non-violence
 isamen na pramatt pravriti hoti he na praan vadh
 Food and drink have a huge impact on our lives and behavior
 manushya swaabhaavik rup se ek shaakaahaari praani he lekin aadhunik jivan style ne use sarvhaari bana diya he
 Therefore, there is a need for self-reflection and self-evaluation
 This will automatically solve many problems
 at: ham andhi pratispardhaatmak daud main naa bhaagen balki swavivek purvak kaary karen
 It has also been said that as you eat food, so will the mind
 ahimsa ko aacharniya kaha gaya he kyonki sansar ke sabhi praani jeena chaahate hai, koi bhi praani maranaa nahin chahta
 Just as everyone loves happiness and sorrow is not loved, so no one should commit violence
 sabhi dharmon main ahimsa kaa mahatv bataaya gaya he lekin phir bhi saare vishwa main dharm ke naam par hi danga, fasaad or hinsak gatividhiyaan hoti hai
 The main reason behind this is religious bigotry, religious hysteria, tolerance and lack of brotherhood
 at: dharmik sahishnutaa evam vaartalap ke dwaara shanti or sadbhaav kaa vaataavaran banane kaa prayaas karnaa chaiye
 From the point of view of Jainism, violence is a problem that arises from a problem and also produces a problem
 jabaki ahimsa na to kashay kaa kaaran he na kashay kaa kaary
 Therefore, non-violence is conductable
 jain dharm ke siddhant : anekantwaad tathaa syadawaad hamen sarv dharm sambhaav kii sikh dete hai baheen bhagwaan mahavir kaa siddhant “jio or jeene do” sab jeevon ke kalyaan kii raah dikhaata he
 This is the principle of "mutual philosophers Jeevanam", benefiting all the living beings, inspiring them to live life while doing good work
 ant main kahana chahta hum ki aaj vishwa ko bhagwaan mahavir ke siddhanton ko apnaane kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki vishwa kalyaan ke liye, vishwa shanti ke liye ahimsa hi ek maatr samaadhaan he
 Hail to Ahimsa Paramo Dharma manushya ko jivan main jaagruk rahete huye satviktaa purna aacharan karnaa chaiye
 Apart from this, complete vegetarianism should be followed in food
 is tarah se jivan main shreshthata tathaa sampannataa aayegi
 Nature will be protected
 yah sabhi jeevon ke hit main he isamen kisi kaa bhi ahit nahin he isiliye yah ek aadhunik shreshth jivan style he
 By adopting it, human can prove his superiority

 modular ganit purnaakon ke ganit kii ek pranali he jisamen kisi purnank par pahunchne ke baad ginati 1 se shuru ho jaati he
 It is sometimes called clockwise mathematics
 is kshetra main swiss ganitagya islar ne bahut ullekhneey kaary kiya
 After this, Carl Friedrich Gauss extended it further
 modulo ganit kaa ek chota sa upyog ghadiyaan ke samay main hota he
 It is 8 o'clock in the morning; 7 hours from now, it should be 8 + 7 = 15, which we call 3
 
 That is, both 15 and 3 are the same for Modulo 12
 do purna sankhyaon a or b ko mapank n ke prati samshesh kehete hai, jab n se a - b vibhajya he
 It is written as follows: n ko samsheshtha kaa mapank kehete hai
 for example kyonki 38 − 14 = 24, jo 12 kaa gunaj he
 The same rule for negative integers is- samsheshtha ke gundharm samikarnon ke gundharmon ke samaan hai
 If a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b and c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} d, then a + c ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b + d and ac ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} bd
 yadi x kaa ek bahupadiy falan f hai, jisen x ke gunak purnank hai or a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b, to f ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } f, parantu yadi ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } ac, to yah aavashyak nahin he ki b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } c, udaahranarth 1 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 6, parantu 1 or 3 samshesh nahin hai ke prati
 The only fruit that can be deduced from ab ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} ac is that one of the great advantages of this notation method of equilibrium is that it beautifully delineates the many fruits of number theory
 can go
 sampurna or laghukrit avasheshon kaa samucchy - samsheshtha sambandh tulyata sambandh he
 This means that the following relationship is true: a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } a ; a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} b means b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} a
 a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } b, b ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } c kaa arth a ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } c he
 Therefore, the equilibrium relationship divides the set of integers into squares of incompleteness such that every two integer measure of a square is contiguous to m and the two integer measure of different fractions is not balanced to m
 yadi m virgon main se prayek varg se ek ek purnank liya jaae, to mapank m ke prati sampurna avasheshon kaa ek ek samucchy praapt hoga
 Thus -3, 3, 2, 12, 14, 20, -6 is a set of complete residues per modulus 7
 mapank m ke prati saralatam avasheshi kaa samucchy 0, 1, 2, 3


 m-1 he or nirpeksh laghutam sampurna avasheshon kaa amucchy nimnaankit he : 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 2, xxrep 6 
 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} / 2, when m is odd tathaa 0, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 1, ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } 2, xxrep 4 
 ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv } / 2, jab m sam he Similarly, if a set of prime integers is taken against m, they can be divided into such squares of f equivalence that every 2 numbers in a given square will be equal to the modulus m and any 2 numbers of the different fractions to the modulus m
 Are not balanced
 pehle kii bhanti yadi prayek varg se ek sankhya lee jaae, to mapank m ke prati laghukrit avasheshon kaa ek samucchy praapt hota he
 a set of this type for m = 12 is 1, 5, 7, 11
 yah smaraneey he ki yadi mapank m ke sampurna avasheshon ke samucchy avyavon ko m ke saapeksh kisi abhajya sankhya r se gun kiya jaae, to mapank m ke prati sampurna avasheshon kaa ek doosraa samucchy praapt hota he
 Similarly if all components of the set of residuals reduced to modulus m are multiplied by a prime number m relative to m, a second class of residuals reduced to modulus m will be obtained
 isse nimnaankit islar pherma prameya praapt he : rf ≡ { \ displaystyle \ equiv} 1, if = 1 vir kunwar singh vishvavidhyalay aara, bihar main sthit ek vishvavidhyalay he

 Traditions are practiced because of their lack of political difficulties
 isi kaaran unhen samvidhan kaa poorak mana jaataa he
 In Britain we can see their most developed and influential form
 inke do prakaar hai:- Parliamentary and presidential types of government sansadeey shashan ke samarthan main tark 1
 raashtrapatiya shashan main raashtrapati vaastavik kaary palika hota he jo janata dwaara nishchit samay ke liye chunaa jaataa he vah vidhayika ke prati uttaradaayi bhi nehi hota he uske mantri bhi vidhayika ke sadsy nahin hote he tathaa usee ke prati uttatdai honge na ki vidhayika ke prati vahi sansadeey shashan main shakti mantri parishad ke paas hoti he jo vidhayika ke prati uttaradaayi hoti he 2
 Parliamentary rule is more useful in view of India's diversity, in which people of all sections of the country can be taken to the Council of Ministers
 3
 is shashan main sangharsh hone kii sambhaavna kam rahati he kyoki mantri vidhayika ke sadsy bhi hote he 4 In a diverse country like India, it is almost impossible to elect a president universally

 Mohan Awasthi started composing songs when he was a high school student
 1950 se hi ‘saraswati’ jaisi patrikaon main unki kavitaaon kaa prakaashan hone laga tha
 The title of Dr
 Awasthi's songs is 'man itself' - if the virtue is contained within the sinner, then it will also become the campaign of my poetry
 rahe bhoomi par yaa ki swarg main meri kavita meri kavita kaa sheershak insaan banegaa
 Dr
 Mohan Awasthi's songs contain all the sensations, pains and visions of human life - talk to me, do you not face the death that has not yet appeared in joy, in mourning, in raga, in misogyny, man's work was never done
 
 ‘anugit’ vidh ke to da0 avasthi pravartak hi hai
 He enforced this law on 29 April 1973 through a copy published in the daily 'deshoot', Allahabad, which got a reputation as a voyager from the Anguja printed in 'dharmyug'

 Dr
 Awasthi's volume - Poetry 'abhishapt Maharthi' and long poems - Raise your lost anthem, today, science, don't tell me the songs of heaven today, i am very famous

 The truth of society and life has descended in his satirical compositions - when the pebble in the court made a terra, put a rupee here, it is mine
 barandon ne, kamaron ne, aa-aa ke gheraa, mujhe haq do meraa, mujhe haq do meraa
 Looted eight-ten-and-twenty rupees there only, where i felt a rush
 
 a mosquito comes to mosquito for death, Shalabh jawala mala comes in goldfish

 Dr
 Awasthi advocates not for 'art for art' but for 'art for life'
 unhone paryaapt balopayogi sahitya likhaa he
 In the song 'chabidar Toys', he has said that all the creatures of the world are the key toys of that supreme being - elephant horses, camels, birds or antelope, all creatures are key toys of that God
 chandaa suraj khet sunahare uske do gubaare hai, parameshwar ke khel niraale kitne pyaare-pyaare hai
 Dr
