 According to the statement of Megadugal Mahasya, just as physical science has its own methods of thinking and special methods, in the same way, it has its own methods and methods of thinking about consciousness
 atev chetana ke vishay main bhautik vigyaan kii vidhiyon se na to sochaa ja saktaa he or na uske pradutt iske kaam main aa sakate hai
 Then physics itself has not been able to publish a definite opinion about the nature of its final units which are the basis of that science
 padaarth, shakti, gati aadi ke vishay main abhi tak kaamchalaoo jaankaree ho saki he
 The final decision has not been taken yet about his appearance
 atev chetana ke vishay main antim nirnay kii aashaa kar lenaa yuktisangat nahin he
 Explaining consciousness through unconscious elements, that is, adding a work-cause relationship to it, is downright indiscriminate
 chetana ko jin manovaigyanikon ne jad padaarth kii kriyaaon ke parinaam ke rup main samajhane kii cheshtaa kii he arthath jinhone ise shaareerik kriyaaon, snaayuon ke spandan aadi kaa parinaam mana he, unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 He has eliminated the presence of consciousness
 pavalaaf or watasan mahoday ke chintan kaa yahi parinaam hua he
 According to his statement, thinking about mind or consciousness in psychology is futile
 manovigyaan kaa vishay manushya kaa drishyman vyavhaar hi hona chahie
 Psychologists have different opinions about the relationship in the body of consciousness
 kuch ke anusaar manushya ke brihat mastishk main honevaali kriyaaon, arthath kuch naadiyon ke spandan kaa parinaam hi chetana he
 It is not an independent element in itself
 dusron ke anusaar chetana swayan tatv he or uskaa sharir se aapasi sambandh he, arthath chetana main honevaali kriyaayein sharir ko prabhavit karti hai
 Sometimes the body is not affected by the actions of consciousness and sometimes the actions of the body do not affect consciousness
 ek mat ke anusaar sharir chetana ke kaary karne kaa yantra maatr hai, jise vah kabhi upyog main laati he or kabhi nahin laati
 But if the device deteriorates, or breaks down, then consciousness becomes crippled for its work
 kuch gambhir manovaigyanik vichaarkon dwaara vigyaan kii vartmaan pragati kii avasthaa main uparyukt mat hi sarvottam mana gaya he
 Three levels of consciousness are considered: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 chetan str par ve sabhi baaten rahati hai jinke dwaara ham sochate samajhate or kaary karte hai
 Man's ego remains in consciousness and here is the organization of thoughts
 avchetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jinka gyaan hamen tatkshan nahin rahata, parantu samay par yaad kii ja sakati hai
 In the unconscious level, there are things which we have forgotten and which we do not remember even after our hard work and through special process which are reminded
 jo anubhutiyaan ek baar chetana main rahati hai, ve hi kabhi avchetan or achetan man main chali jaati hai
 These sensations are not completely passive, but continue to affect humans inadvertently
 chetana saamaajik vaataavaran ke sampark se viksit hoti he
 Man gets morality, justification and tact from the influence of environment
 ise chetana kaa vikaas kaha jaataa he
 At the height of development, consciousness realizes freedom
 vah saamaajik baton ko prabhavit kar sakati he or unase prabhavit hoti he, parantu is prabhaav se apane aapako alag bhi kar sakati he
 This kind of feeling of consciousness is addressed with the words pure Chaitanya or Pramata, Atma etc
 isaki charchaa chalrs yung, spengl, wiliam brown aadi vidwaanon ne kii he
 It has been considered outside the boundary of the country

 At the same time Philip waged war against Bezantium, leaving Alexander in charge of the kingdom
 philip kii anupasthiti ke dauraan, thresian maidi ne macidonia ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Alexander immediately launched a campaign against him and drove him out of his territory

 While still occupied in Thrace, Philip ordered Alexander to set up an army for an expedition into southern Greece
 kahin anya greek rajya isamen hastkshep na karen, sikandar ne aisa dikhaaya ki vah eliaria par hamalaa karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Illyrias invaded Macedonia, which Alexander drove back

 Philip then returned to Ilesia, from where he sent a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, which were both rejected
 philip ne dakshin kii ore kooch kii, jahaan uske virodhiyon ne use cheronia, boesia ke paas roak liya
 For the Battle of Charonia, Philip ordered the right line and Alexander with a group of Philip's trusted generals to take over the left line
 pracheen sroton ke anusaar, donon paksh main kuch samay ke liye bhanyakar ladaai hui
 Philip deliberately ordered his troops to retreat, so that the Athenian soldiers could chase and break away from their security line, and they could penetrate it
 sikandar ne sabase pehle thiban ki suraksha panktiyon ko todaa, uske peeche philip ke generalon the, dushman ke saamanjasy ko nuksaan pahunchane ke baad, philip ne apane sainikon ko aage badhane kaa aadesh diya or unhen jaldi gherne kaa aadesh diya

 antat: ve haar gaye
 After the victory in Charonia, Philip and Alexander proceeded unopposed to the Peloponnese where they were welcomed by all the cities; However, when they reached Sparta, they were rejected there, but Philip did not resort to war

 jab philip pela waapas laut aayaa, to use apane senapati atlus kii bhatiji cleopetra iridiis se pyaar ho gaya or usase vivaah kar liya
 This marriage led to Alexander's claim as heir, as the son born to Cleopatra Irides would have been a complete Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half Macedonian

 haalanki, aisa prathit hota he ki philip ne kabhi bhi apane raajnneetijna or sainya prashikshit bete ko asweekaar nahin karnaa chahta tha
 Accordingly, Alexander returns to Macedonia after six months due to the efforts of Demratus, a family friend
 agle varsh main, pixodaras, kaaria ke farsi governor ne apni sabase badi beti ko sikandar ke sautele bhai, philip arhidiyas se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Olympius and many of Alexander's friends suggest that Philip intended to make Erhidius his successor
 sikandar ne pixelrus ko ek doot thisslus ko bhej yah batalaai ki use apni beti kaa haath avaidh bete ko dene ke bajaay sikandar ko dena chaiye
 When Philip heard of this, he stopped the offer negotiations and shouted out to Alexander that he wanted to marry Kyu Pixodarus' daughter, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him
 philip ne sikandar ke chaar mitron harpalus, narkus, tolmi or arygiyas ko nirvasit kar diya, or korinthiens ko thisslus ko zanjeeron main laane ke liye bhej diya
 In the summer of 336 BCE, Philip is assassinated by his bodyguard captain, Posnis, while attending the marriage of his daughter Cleopatra in Ayge
 jab posnis bhaagane kaa prayaas kiya, to sikandar ke do saathi, perdicus or leonatas ne uskaa peechha kar use maar daalaa
 At the same time, at the age of 20, Alexander was declared king by the nobles and the army
 singhaasana sambhalate hi sikandar apane pratidwandviyon ko khatm karne laga
 He started by killing his cousin, the former Amintus Fourth
 usne lancastis kshetra ke do macedonian rajkumaron ko bhi maar diya, halanki tisare, alexander lancastis ko chhod diya
 Olympus burned Cleopatra Iridis and Europa, Philip's daughter, alive
 jab alexander ko is bare main pataa chalaa, to vah krodhit hua
 Alexander also ordered the assassination of Atalus, Cleopatra's uncle and advance commander of the Army of Asia campaign
 atlus us samay athens main apane dosharahit hone kii sambhaavna ke bare main demothens se baatcheet karne gaya tha
 Atalus had insulted Alexander several times, and after Cleopatra's murder, Alexander considered it too dangerous to leave him alive
 sikandar ne arhidiyas ko chhod diya, joki sambhawatah olympiyas dwaara jehar dene ke parinamswaroop, maansik rup se viklang ho chukaa tha
 The news of Philip's death led to rebellions in several states, including Thebes, Athens, Thistle and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon
 jab vidroh kii khabar sikandar tak pahunchi, to usne turant us par dhyaan diya
 Instead of using diplomacy, Alexander marched south towards Thistley, forming a 3,000 Macedonian cavalry
 usne paaya kii thisli kii sena, olympius parvat or osa parvat ke bich ke raste par kabja kiye hue he, usne apni sena ko osa parvat par chadhane kaa aadesh diya
 The next day, when the Thistlean army awoke, Alexander found himself standing behind him with his army, and they immediately surrendered
 sikandar ne unki ghudsavaar sena ko apni main mila kar dakshin main pelloponis kii ore kooch karne laga
 Alexander halted at Thermopile, where he was chosen as the leader of the Amphictyonic League, then proceeded south from there to Corinth
 athens ne shanti ke liye guhaar lagaai, jise sikandar ne maan liya or vidrohiyon ko maaf kar diya
 The famous meeting between Alexander and Diogenes Diogenes the Scenic took place in Corinth
 jab sikandar ne diogens se poocha ki vah unke liye kya kar saktaa he, to darshanik ne ghrinaapurvak se sikandar ko ek taraf khadaa hone ke liye kaha, kyonki vah surya ke prakaash ko avaruddh kar rahaa tha
 Alexander was amused by this spot-on answer, and he said, "if i hadn't been Alexander, i wanted to be Diogenes"
 corinth main, jaise philip ko faras ke khilaaf aane vaale yuddh ke liye commander niyukt kiya gaya tha vaise hi sikandar ko hegaman kaa sheershak diya gaya
 Here he also received news of the Thracian rebellion
 asia ko paar karne se pehle, sikandar apni uttari simaaon ko surakshit karnaa chahta tha
 In the spring of 335 BC, he set out to suppress several rebellions
 ampipolis se shuru hokar, vah "swatantra thresian" ke desh main purv kii ore yatra karata rahaa; or hemas parvat par, macedonian sena ne thresian senaaon ko oonchaaiyon par bhi hamalaa kar parajeet kiya
 Further troops entered the country of Tribali and defeated their forces near the river Laijinus

 Crossing the river at night itself, he surprised them and forced his army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish
 sikandar tak jab yah samachar pahunchi ki celsius, eliaria kaa raja or tyualanti ke raja gluaaki uske khilaaf khule main vidroh karne lage the
 He turned to Illyria in the west, after Alexander defeated them one by one, forcing both rulers to flee with his Saina
 in jeeton ke saath hi, usne apni uttari seemaa ko surakshit kar liya tha
 While Alexander was on his north expedition, he was informed of the rebellion of Thebes and the Athenian once again and Alexander immediately marched south
 jabaki anya shahar sikandar se takaraane main jhijak rahe the, thibs ne ladaai karne kaa faisla kiya
 Thebes' resistance was ineffective, and Alexander overtook them and annexed the city and divided the region among other Bootian cities
 thibs ke ant ne athens ko chup kar diya or asthaayee taur par hi sahi, saare yunaan par shanti aa gai
 Alexander then left his Asian campaign, leaving Antipiter as regent
 spitameness kii mrityu or roksena ke saath uski nai shaadi ke baad, sikandar ne bhartiya upmahadweep ki ore apana dhyaan le gaya
 He invited all the chiefs of Gandhara, and asked them to take his jurisdiction under Alexander

 Ambi went to him with all his army, assuring Alexander of friendship and giving him valuable gifts
 sikandar ne na keval use uskaa pad or uphaaron ko lautaa diya, balki usne ambhi ko "farsi vastra, sone or chaandi ke gahane, 30 ghode or 1,000 sone kii pratibhaaen" uphaar swaroop de diya
 Alexander divided his army, and Ambi helped Hephaestion and Pedricus to build the bridge over the Indus River, as well as supplying food to his soldiers
 usne sikandar or uski puri sena kaa uski rajdhani takshashila shahar main dosti kaa sabase bada pradarshan karte hue sabase udaar aatithy ke saath swaagat kiya
 As Alexander advanced, Taxila took part in the Battle of the Jhelum River, with the help of an army of 5,000 of his men
 is yuddh main vijay ke baad, sikandar ne ambhi ko puruvas se baatcheet ke liye bheja, jisamen poras kaa sara rajya sikadanr ke adheen karne jaisi sharten peshkash kii gai, chunki aambhi or poras puraane dushman the usne sabhi sharten thukraa di or ambhi badi mushkil se apni zindagi bachaa vahaan se bhaag paaya
 However, the two rivals were then reconciled by Alexander to personal mediation; And Takshashila, due to the contribution of equipment and forces to the fleet on the Jhelum, Ambi was assigned the entire area between the Jhelum River and the Indus; He gained more power after the death of Machatus' son Philip; After Alexander's death and subsequent partition of the provinces in Triparadisus in 321 BCE, he was allowed to retain his authority
 327 / 326 isa purv kii sardeeyon main, sikandar ne kunar ghaatiyon kii aspisioi, guruis ghati ke gurani, or swat or buner ghaatiyon ke asenki jaise kshetreey kabilon ke khilaaf ek abhiyaan chalaaya
 a fierce battle ensues with Espacioi in which Alexander's shoulder is wounded by a spear, but eventually Espacioi is defeated
 sikandar ne phir assakenoi kaa saamana kiya, jisane massaga, ora or arons ke gadhon se ladaayeeyaan ladi
 The fort of Massaga was won only after a bloody battle, in which Alexander's ankle was severely injured
 curtius ke anusaar, "na keval alexander ne massaga kii puri aabaadi ko maar daalaa, balki uske sabhi imaaraton ko malbe main badal diya
 "A similar massacre was also carried out in Ora
 massaga or ora ke baad, kai assensian arons ke kile main bhaag gaye
 Alexander followed them and after four days of bloody fighting captured this strategic hill-fort
 arons ke baad, 326 isa purv main sikandar ne sindhu ko paar kiya or raja poras ke khilaaf ek mahayuddh jeeta, jiskaa jhelum or chenab nadi ke bich vaale kshetra par shashan tha, jo ab punjab kaa kshetra kehalaata hai
 Alexander was greatly impressed by Porus's bravery, and made him one of his allies
 usne poras ko apana upapati niyukt kar diya, or uske kshetra ke saath, uske apane jite dakshin-purv main vyas nadi tak ke kshetra ko jod diya
 Choosing the local vice president helped these countries in administration so far away from Greece

 The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed in recent decades
 multah, eks-re naliyon se utsarjit hone vaale vidyut chumbakeey vikiran kaa tarangadairghy radiodharmee nabhik se utsarjit vikiran ke tarangadairghy se lanbaa tha
 The ancient literature established a distinction between x and gamma radiation based on wavelengths where radiation, defined as gamma rays, was smaller than a unilateral wavelength, such as 10–11 m

 jahaan tak eks-re kaa sawaal he, yah avashoshit maatra ke baraabar hota he
 Medical X-rays are an important source of man-made radiation exposure, with a magnitude of 58% in the United States in 1987, but since most radiation exposures are natural, the magnitude of medical X-rays is higher than the total US radiation exposure
 It is only 10 percent

 Therefore, a thin metallic sheet, often an aluminum sheet or sheet, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed on the window of the X-ray tube, which filters the low-energy components in the spectrum
 ise beam kaa sakhtikaran kehete hai
 Both of these processes of producing X-rays are very inefficient, their output capacity is only around one percent and, therefore, the electric power that can be entered as input, to produce a usable current of X-rays a high percentage of k is released as waste heat

 This is because bones have a higher electron density than soft tissues
 bvfget X-rays are detected based on various methods
 sabase adhik aam taur par jane jane vaale tareeke - photographic plate, casette main photographic film or durlabh prithvi screen hai
 They are all classified as "image receptors" regardless of the elements involved in the image

 In more recent years, computerized and digital radiography is being used in place of photographic film in medical and dental applications, although film technology is still widely used in industrial radiography processes
 Photographic plates are mostly a matter of history, and the "intensifying screen" that replaces them is also becoming dull in history

 Initially, the most common detection methods were based on ionization of gases, such as in the Geiger – Müller counter: a sealed volume, typically a cylinder, with a gas, cylindrical cathode in a mica, polymer or thin metallic window, and a wire is anode; High voltage is passed between the cathode and the anode
 jab ek eks-re photon silinder main pravesh karti he, to yah gaiyr kaa ynikaran karti he or yanon va electronon kaa nirmaan karti he
 In this process, electrons move rapidly towards the anode, leading to further ionization along their trajectory

 Scientists investigating cathode rays, ie energetic electrons, produced in tubes for the first time around 1875 saw X-rays emanating from experimental immersion tubes called the Crux tube
 crukes naliyaan, kuch kilovolt or 100 kevi ke bich kahin bhi ek ucch disi voltage dwaara nalee main avshisht hawa ke ynikaran ke dwaara mukt electronon kaa nirmaan karti thim
 These voltages greatly accelerated the movement of electrons coming from the cathode at high velocities, creating X-rays when they hit the glass wall or anode of the tube

 Although Puluyi studied with Röntgen at the University of Strasbourg from the years 1873 to 1875, his biographer Guida claims that his subsequent research was done independently
 april 1887 main, nicola testla ne ucch voltage or khud dizin kii gai naliyon ke saath-saath crukes naliyon kaa upyog karke eks-re kii jaanch kerani shuru kii
 His technical publications indicate that he had invented and developed a special single electrode X-ray tube that was different from other X-ray tubes with no target electrode

 By 1892, Tesla conducted many such experiments, but did not classify these emissions, which were later known as X-rays
 testla ne is ghatana ko "adrishy" prakaar kii vikiran urja ke rup main samanyikrut kiya
 Tesla, in his 1897 X-ray lecture in front of the New York Academy of Sciences, described the facts of his methods concerning various experiments

 His letter to The Physical Review, dated January 6, 1893, was duly published and published in San Francisco Examiner, an article entitled Without Lenses or Light, Photographs Taken with Plate and Object in Darkness
 henrich hertz kaa philip lenard naamak ek chaatr yah dekhnaa chahta tha ki cathod kirane, hawa main crukes nalee se hokar guzar sakati hai yaa nahin
 He built a crux tube at the end of which was a "window" made of thin aluminum with its front side facing the cathode so that the cathode rays could hit it
 unhone dekha ki usamen se kuch niklaa jiske photographic platon ke prati anaavruth kii vajah se pratidipti utpann hui
 He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various substances
 It has been reported that at least some of these "lenard rays" were actually X-rays
 harman won helmholtz ne eks-re ke ganitiya samikarnon ko sutarabaddh kiya
 He conceived a scattering theory before Röntgen's discovery and announcement
 ise prakaash ke vidyut chumbakeey siddhant ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 However, he did not work with real X-rays
 8 navambar 1895 ko lenard or crukes naliyon ke saath prayog karte samay german bhautikee professor wilhem rontagan kaa saamana eks-re se hua or unhone in par adhyayan karnaa shuru kar diya
 He produced an initial report titled "on a New Kind of Ray: a Preliminary Communication" and on 28 December 1895 he submitted the report to the Journal of the physical-medical Society of Würzburg
 eks-re par likhaa gaya yah pehla shodh-patr tha
 Röntgen referred to the radiation as "X" to inform that it was an unknown type of radiation
 yah naam isse jud gaya, haalanki unke kai sahyogiyon ne un kirnon kaa namakaran rontagan kirnon ke rup main karne kaa suzav diya tha
 They are still referred to by similar names in many languages, including German
 rontagan ko apni khoj ke liye bhautikee main pratham nobel puraskaar praapt hua
 There are considerable differences in the details of his discovery as Röntgen burned his lab notes at the time of his death, but this may have been the concoction of his biographers: Röntgen, a crux tube and a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide
 With cathode rays attached to it, which they wrapped in a black curboard so that the visible light emitted from the tube interfered Do not
 He saw a misty green glow emanating from the screen at about 1 meter distance
 He felt that some invisible rays from the tube were passing through the cardboard, which caused the curtain to glow
 unhone paaya ki ve unki mej par rakhi kitabon or kaagajon se hokar bhi guzar sakati thi
 Röntgen immediately began systematically investigating these unknown rays

 Traditions in Indian popular cinema are made up of 6 major influences
 pehla; pracheen bhartiya mahakavyon mahabharat or ramayana ne bhartiya cinema ke vichaar or kalpana par gaharaa prabhaav choda he visheshkar kathanak par
 Examples of this effect are the accompanying story, the back story and the technique of story within the story
 In the plot of popular Indian films, the story often spreads to sub-narratives, the plot can be seen in the 1993 film Khalnayak Aur Gardish
 doosraa : pracheen sanskrit naatak, apni shailibaddh swarup or pradarshan par mahatv ke saath sangeet, nrity or bhav bhangima milakar " jeevant kalatmak ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan nrity or anukaran / swang naatakeey anubhav kaa centre hai"
 Sanskrit plays are also known as Natya
 natya shabd kii utpatti "nrit" shabd mul se hui he jisase sanskrit naatak ke bhavy nrity naatak charitra kaa pataa chalata he jis parampara kaa paalan aaj bhi hindi cinema main ho rahaa he abhinay kii raas vidhi jisaki utpatti pracheen sanskrit naatak ke kaal main hui thi, ek mul gun he jo jo bharitay cinema ko pashchimi cinema se bhinn karata he
 In the Raas Vidhi, the actor exhibits a "sense of empathy" that the viewer feels is in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become the "living awakening avatar" of his character
 " abhinay kii raas paddati lokapriy hindi film abhinayta jaise amitabh bachchan or shahrukh khan or desh bhar main priy film jaise rang de basanti, or antarashtriya str par saraahi gayi satyajit re ke filmo bhi dikhataa he
 Third: The traditional folk Indian theater, which became popular after the fall of Sanskrit drama in the 10th century
 in kshetreey prathaon main bengal kii jatra, uttar pradesh kii ram lila, karnataka kaa yakshagan, andhra pradesh kaa chindu naatakam, or tamilnadu kaa terukkutu he
 Fourth: Parsi theater, which presents realism and fantasy, music and dance, plot and performance, ground dialogue and a mastery of stage performances, all of them together in a dramatic address by Atinatak
 parsi naatakon main bhonda hasya, madhur gane or sangeet, sansanikhej or chakachaundh stage kala hoti he
 "all these effects are evident in the masala films made by filmmakers like Manmohan Desai in the 1970s and 1980s
 iskaa udahaaran hai kuli or haal hi main samikshakon dwaara prashansit rang de basanti 
 Fifth: Hollywood in the 1920s to 1950s when musical films were popular there, though Indian filmmakers differed from their Hollywood counterparts in many ways
 udahaaran ke liye hollywood kii sangitamay film kaa plat adhiktar manoranjan kii duniya main hi hota tha jabaki bhartiya filmkaar lokapriy filmo main fantasy ke tatwon ko badhaate hue geet-sangeet or nrity ko kai paristhitiyon main abhivyakti kaa ek prakritik madhyam kii tarah istemaal karte the
 Mythology, history, fairy tale etc
 along with song and dance is an Indian tradition
 iske atirikt "jahaan hollywood ke filmkaar apni filmo ko nirmit swarup ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai taaki yathartwaadee kathanak puri tarah se pradhan rahe, bhartiya filmkaar is tathy ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karte kii screen par dikhaaya gaya drishy ek kriti, ek maaya, ek kalpana he
 But he mixed his work with people's daily life in interesting and complex ways
 " ek or prabhaav pashchimi mujeec video hai jinka 1990 ke baad se kaaphi prabhaav padaa he jise nrity kram, camera angel, gati or sangeet meme bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 An early example of this is Mani Ratnam's' Bombay
 lokapriy bhartiya cinema kii tarah bhartiya samaantar cinema par bhi bhartiya theatre or bhartiya sahitya kaa prabhaav padaa he lekin antarrashtriya prerana ke rup main us par european cinema khaas taur par italian navayathartwaad or french kaavyatmak yathartwaad) kaa hollywood ke mukaable zyaada asar padaa he
 Satyajit Ray has called the Italian film filmmaker Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and French filmmaker John Raynor's The River, an inspiration for his debut film Pather Panchali
 re ne apane aap ko european cinema or bengali sahitya ke alaava bhartiya theatre kii parampara khaas taur par shastreey sanskrit naatak kii raas paddati kaa bhi karzdaar mana he
 In Raas, the characters not only feel emotion but also depict the audience in an artistic form and this is the double depiction seen in the Apu trilogy
 
 bimal roy kii do bigha zamin bhi de sika kii bisical thivs se prerit thi or isane bhartiya nayi lahar kaa maarg prashast kiya jo french nayi lahar or japani nayi lahar kaa samakaleen tha
 Some Indian films of the 1930s are known as "multilingual"
 in filmo ko milti julati lekin asmaan roopaantar main vibhinn bhashaaon main shoot kiya gaya tha

 Filmmakers often choose to shoot at a film location, as they believe that greater realism can be achieved in a "real" space than in a studio, but location shooting often depends on the film's budget
 The cost is higher than studio shooting

 According to him, like the three directions, time is also a dimension and in physics it should be seen as four dimensions simultaneously
 unhone kaha ki vastav main brahmand kii sabhi chizein is chaar-aiami dik-kaal main rahati hai
 He also said that sometimes situations arise when different objects experience different experiences in all these dimensions
 dik or kaal kaa sambadh hamaare nity vyavhaar main itnaa adhik aata he ki inke vishay main kuch adhuri si kintu drudh dharanaayen hamaare man main bachapan se hi hona swaabhaavik he
 Poets have narrated serious, vast and beautiful fantasies of problems and periods
 darshan main or paashchaatya manovigyaan main bhi inke vishay main puraatan kaal se soch vichaar hota aa rahaa he
 In Kanad's Vaishika philosophy, the concepts of sky, trouble and time are explained and their properties are also described
 indriyajanya anubhavon se jo gyaan miltaa he usamen dik or kaal kaa sambandh avashya hi hota he
 If the reality of this knowledge is understood, then problems and times cannot be separated from reality
 prayek darshanik sampradaay ne vastaviktaa, dik or kaal, inke paraspar sambandhon kii apni apni dharanaayen di hai, jinamein aikamaty nahin he
 Problems and periods are also related indirectly in mathematics
 at: pratishthit bhautikee kaa vikaas inhen dharanaon par nirbhar rahaa
 When some of the experimental fruits of physics appeared to be inconsistent with these assumptions, then these ideas began to deviate, and Relativism established a new form of problem and time, which has been proved and consequently unanimous by many experiments
 dik tathaa kaal kaa yah nayaa swaroop keval bhinn hi nahin varan samajhane main bhi atyant kathin he, kyonki iske pratipaadan main vishisht ganit kaa upyog aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, where problem and time relationship comes, it will be easier to clarify first from macro point of view, then from micro point of view and finally from physics point of view
 indriyajanya anubhavon se jo dik ke gunon kaa pratyay aata he, usase dik ke vibhinn prakaar maane ja sakate hai
 Perceptions are formed on the intelligence of experiences, and perceptions are formed
 is prakaar swanubhav se dik kii jo dharna banati he use "swa-dik' athwa "vyaktigat dik' kaha jaataa he
 In sensory experiences, many experiences are the same for all individuals, and the phenomenon that such experiences meet is called "real"
 vastav ghatnaon ke samudaayon se "vaastaviktaa' kii dharna banati he
 The senses give experiences of sight, touch, sound, taste and smell, but these experiences are always worthy of faith, it is not so
 prakashkeey sambhram to suprasiddh hai hi
 Even tactile behavior seems to be frequent, as the lair between two teeth is shorter than the tongue
 praaia: aisa hi prakaar sab tarah ke indriyajanya anubhavon kaa hota he
 Therefore, the perception of personal problems from these imperfect experiences is illusory
 maapndand tathaa anya uchit yantron kii sahaayta se indriyon kii maryaadit graahakta badhaai ja sakati he or is prakaar anek ghatnaon kaa bhramanirasan ho saktaa he
 The perception of a problem by measuring in experiments is called a "physical problem"
 maapan ke liye maapndand kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 There are four types of problems related to problems and by considering these four types practical problems of problems are formed
 kisi vastu ke sthal kaa nirdesh jab vahaan kahkar kiya jaataa he, tab dik ke ek swaroop kii kalpana aati he or iskaa arth yah bhi mana jaataa he ki dik kaa astitv swatantra he
 The direction of the site of an object is shown in the "relative position" of the problem when it is "relative" to the other object
 dik kaa teesraa swaroop vastuon ke "aakaar' se miltaa he, jisase dik kii vibhajyata kii bhi kalpana kii ja sakati he
 Looking up at the sky shows the fourth form of the "vastness" of the problem
 in chaar prakaar ke swaroopon se hi praaia: dik ke sambadh main vyaavhaarik dharanaayen banati hai or dik ke gun bhi suchit hote hai
 If the sensory experiences gained from the events are discussed, they have two types
 ghatnaon ke sthanbhed se dik kii kalpana hoti he or unke kram-bhed se kaal kii kalpana hoti he
 Thus problems and periods enter our ideology suspiciously
 dik jaisaa hi kaal bhi vyaktigat hota he or prayek vyakti kii kalganana swatantra tathaa swecch hoti he
 Not only this, there is also a change in the calculation of this self-time and it depends on the health, condition, etc
 conditions of the person, for example, if a person is engrossed in any work, then the time is cut fast
 at: vyaktigat athwa swa-kaal vishwaas yogya nahin rahata
 The period measured by a natural event - day and night - will not be personal and will be the same for all people
 at: aise kaal ko saarvajanik kaal kaha jaataa he
 There are macro divisions of day and night
 inke chote vibhaag kiye jaaen to vyavhaar main kaalamaapan ke liye ve adhik upyukt hote hai
 Hence Prahar, Ghatika, Pal Vipal or Hour, Minute, Second etc
 departments were done
 saamanyat: kaal kaa maapan ghadi se hota he
 Like problems, four forms of time also appear in practice
 kisi ghatana athwa anubhav se "kab?' prashn upasthit hota he or iskaa dik vishyak "kahan' se samya he
 From this imagination, the existence of Kaal is considered independent
 kisi ghatana ke kaal ke saapeksh duusari ghatana kaa varnan karte samay kaal kaa saapeksh swaroop dikhaai detaa he
 The form of time that appears between the two events is similar to the size of the problem
 vaise hi kaal ke anadi, anant ityadi visheshnon se kaal kii vishalata dikhaai dati he
 If we consider the four forms of problems and times, or qualities, then our perceptions about them are called "self" or "personal" or "psychological" problems and periods
 dik tathaa kaal kii dharanaon ko nishchit rup dene ke liye unka maapan karne ke saadhan aavashyak hote hai
 Penalties, tools and instruments of hard materials are used to measure problems
 in upkarnon se lambaai, kone, kshetrafal, aaytan ityadi vastuon ke gunon ke maapan hote he
 The assumptions of the time point, line, plane, etc
 of these measurements are made
 jab anek punraritiyon se ye dharanaayen drudh ho jaati hai, tab bindu, rekha, samtal ityadi kaa sthaan moulik hota he or bhautik vastuen in dharanaon se dur ho jaati hai
 Now the similarity of these assumptions and the fundamental assumptions of Euclide geometry will be clear
 drudh vastuon ko samavisht karke dik ke, athwa vastuon ke, maapan se dik kii jo dharna hoti he use jyamitiya athwa eucalidia dik kaha jaataa he
 It is clear that the properties that are perceived by this notion of problem depend only on the definitions, axioms and imaginations of Euclidean geometry
 dik kii hamaari vyaavhaarik dharna or maapan se nishchit kii hui yah jyamitiya dharna, kramash: hamaari sthool drushti or sookshm drushti ke swaroop hai
 Although this notion of fixed problems on Euclide geometry may seem natural, it needs to be analyzed
 eucalidia jyamiti main kuch paribhaashaayen tathaa kuch swayansiddh tathy die hue hai or inkaa taarkik drushti se vikaas kiya gaya he
 These assumptions are only imaginary and independent
 thodaa hi vichaar karne par yah spasht hoga ki eucalidia jyamiti kaa vyavhaar kii vastuon se koi bhi vaastavik sambandh nahin he
 While developing their original fantasies, they had a mutually rational relationship and created an "imaginary" mathematics, which was the basic objective of this geometry
 is uddeshy main yah jyamiti atyant hi safal rahi
 To make this geometry even more "practical", the definition of "ideal object" is that the difference of its two points remains the same under any circumstance
 maapan dand athwa anya aujaaron kaa upyog isi visheshta par nirbhar karata he
 In fact, by incorporating this "ideal hard object", the form of Euclidean geometry changes and we can now understand it as a department of physics
 kintu vyavhaar main eucalidia jyamiti kaa yah parivartan is drushti se nahin dekha jaataa
 When measuring, the principles of Euclidean geometry for measuring practical objects appear to be accurate
 isliye eucalidia jyamiti ko "vaastavik' samajha jane laga
 From the point of view of practical experience and Euclidean geometry, Newton certainly introduced his problems and conceptions of time and the development of iconic physics often depended on these concepts until the beginning of the present century
 newton ne dik ko swatantra satta samajhakar uske gun bhi die
 According to Newton, the properties of a problem are the same in all directions and at all points, that is, the problem is equidistant, equal and similar
 at: padaarthon ke gun dik main sabhi sthanon par samaan hi hote hai
 The problem is infinite and in Newton's problem is uninterrupted by length, time and speed
 kaal ke vishay main bhi newton ne apni dharna di he or yah dharna bhi us samay ke bhautikee ke vikaas ke anusaar hi thi
 According to Newton, Kaal is also an independent entity
 kaal kaa vishesh gun yah he ki vah samaan gati se satat or sarvatra "bahata' he or kisi bhi paristhiti kaa uske upar koi bhi parinaam nahin hota
 Time is also infinite
 saransh main, newton ke anusaar dik tathaa kaal donon hi swatantra or nirpeksh sattayen hoti hai
 The mechanics of Newton etc
 depended on these assumptions
 yantriki main gati or twaran, in donon ke liye dik or kaal ko nishchit rup dena aavashyak tha or us samay to in dharanaon main koi bhi truti dikhaai nahin detii thi
 Likewise, Newton had such an influence in physics that it was not possible to show doubt on these assumptions
 bolai, lobaatchevsky, riman ityadi ganitagyon ne yah siddh kiya ki eucalidia jyamiti ke kuch swayantathyon main uchit parivartan karne par aeuclidia jyamitiyon kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 Although many theories of euclideal geometries differ from theories of euclideal geometry, they are not disqualified
 visheshat: riman ke aeuclidia jyamiti se yah spasht hua ki eucalidia jyamiti hi keval moulik nahin he
 Although euclideal geometries are difficult to visualize, their results are extremely interesting and appropriate due to the logic
 inamen teen se adhik vimitiyon ke dik kii jo kalpana hoti he, us dik kii vakrata kii kalpana vishesh rup se upyukt hui
