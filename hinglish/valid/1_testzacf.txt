 Nietzsche has played an important role in the development of psychoanalyticism, existentialism and perceptive thinking

 However, his works were also misused by Nazi and fascist politicians

 Nietzsche also supported Ritschl at the University of Leipzig
 24 varsh kii hi avasthaa main nitshe besl vishvavidhyalay main bhashaa-vigyaan ke praadhyaapak pad par niyukt hua
 Nietzsche also had a fascination for military life

 The first time being injured in an accident and the second time being unwell
 lipazig ke vidhyaarthee jivan main hi vah prasiddh sangatijna vegener ke ghanishtha sampark main aa chukaa tha or, saath hi shopenhavar kii pustak ""sankalp evam vichaar ke rup main vishwa"" se apni darshan sambandhi dharanaon ke liye bal praapt kar chukaa tha
 The relationship between Nietzsche and Wegener is considered as an important formula for understanding Nietzsche's personality
 1879 i

 After that, for about ten years he wandered from place to place in search of health; But in the meantime he composed great books for which he is famous
 1889 main use pakshaaghaat kaa daura hua or maansik rup se vah sadaa ke liye veikshipt ho gaya
 By the time of Nietzsche's death, his compositions had gained fame
 atimanav kii avadharana nitshe ke darshan kaa kendriya chintan he
 Nietzsche's thinking is a very broad and rich but somewhat complicated response to the ideological and cultural reality of his time
 vah aise darshan kii sristi karnaa chahta he jo sabhi mulyon kaa punarmulyikaran kar sake
 He criticizes various aspects of European culture
 alochana sookshm tathaa manavaigyanik he or usamen moulik ekta he
 But in the analysis of the questions that have been raised, there is the revolutionary impatience and the confidence of a prophet in the solution
 mul vichaaron kii vibhinn pustakon main punrariti hui he, haalanki yah punrariti thakaavat nahin utpann karti
 Most of his books are written in formulas, if the effectiveness of euphemisms is increased, the ambiguity of ideas also increases and Nietzsche seems to refute his own

 Protestant backgrounds and early introduction to ancient Greek literature gave him anti-rites of these thought traditions, but Kant's epistemology, Schopenhauer's contemplation, Romanticism pervaded in German literature and art, comparative ethics and self-developmentalism served as a philosophical ground for him

 According to Nietzsche, these rules are also not universal, they themselves are restricted by our interests, values and resolutions
 'ham satya ko hi kyon jaananaa chaahate hai', ""kyon nahin asaty, anishchita yaa agyaan ko jaananaa chaahate?"" nitshe kaa uttar he- anischitata main hamen jeene kii sambhaavna nahin prathit haati

 But life means assimilation, expansion and determination of power "
 at: "shakti kaa sankalp" hi saarvbhaum satya he, yahi hamaare gyaan ke rup ko nirmit karata he
 The very concept of determination of power inspires the creation of superman, which is the basis of Nietzsche's thinking
 naitik yaa aniatik kya he, iskaa koi vastunishth maandand nahin ho saktaa
 Moral is what results from the predominance of the determination of power, immorality is the manifest form of weakness
 vyaktiyon main "shakti ke sankalp" kii "maatra main bhinnata ke kaaran samaaj kii ruparekha pyramid kii bhanti hoti he
 Nietzsche considers the upper classes as rulers and the lower ones as slaves
 donon virgon kii sweekrut mulya-sanrani bhinn bhinn prakaar kii hoti he
 The life-values of upper class persons are the result of their personality ability and the spontaneous life they generate, but the values of lower class are the result of reaction to upper class
 isai mat tathaa janawaad se sambandhit mulyon ko nitshe nimna varg ke mulya maanata he
 These values are the result of mental glands of weak personality
 inamen shreshth vyaktiyon ko bhi neeche ghaseetne kii kucheshtaa he
 For progress, Nietzsche considers it necessary to establish a high class value tradition
 hindu varna-vyavastha bhi kabhi kabhi use apane adarsh ke anukool prathit hoti he, evam isi aadhaar par vah manusmriti ko bible se shreshth granth maanata he
 The development of human personality will reveal the capabilities of humans, this principle is the soul of Nietzsche's philosophy
 maanav saadhan he prithvi par atimanav ke avataran kaa, parantu yah avataran vikaswad ke anusaar na hokar maanav ke sacruy evam saavdhaan prayatnon kaa parinaam hoga
 Spontaneous living and voluntarily adopted discipline for him is the criterion of Nietzsche's ideal man
 vyakti ko roodhiyon kaa nahin shreshth purushon kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 "" God has died "" is the famous statement of Nietzsche, but by this utterance he intends to direct the end of eternalism in values and the prevailing infidelity in the human mind
 saath hi vah yah bhi spasht karnaa chahta he ki shreshth purush hi ab maanav kii sabase badi aashaa he
 Nietzsche's works had a wide impact on the philosophical world
 uski pustak "zarathustra kii vaani" vishwa kii shreshthatam saahitiyik kritiyon main gini jaati he
 In the same way, the "tradition of values" before virtue and sin presents a new twist in philosophy

 The early mosques were very simple and included simple storied buildings with no towers or dome required
 islam main masjid ke liye keval sthaan vishesh hoti he magar iske vaastushilp par kadagan nahin
 Initially the mosque was constructed from the roof of pillars and addresses of the stems of Nabvi dates
 kaaba pattharon se bani ek chaukor imaarat thi jiske aasapaas khule parisar main puja hoti thi
 But over time, Muslims went to study resources and built mosques according to their needs and the culture of the region
 masjidon main mahange kaam or buland minar or gumbad baad main bananaa shuru hue
 The reason for the tower was that the mosque was visible from a distance, the azan di sound came on it and there was a glimpse of the culture and art of the area
 gumbad se masjid vaktaa ke bhaashan or prarthana kii awaz ek gunj or saundarya ke saath puri masjid main faili thi

 During the fighting, Stauffenberg was with 10 tanks and troops in front of the armored division
 is prabhag ne, 8 april ko 21 bakhtarband prabhag ke saath mejona ke paas rakshaatmak sthiti akhriyaar kii
 As he was moving from one troop to another while giving instructions, his vehicle was shot down by British fighter bombers on 7 April 1943, in which he was seriously injured
 unhone munich main ek aspataal main teen maheene bitaye, jahaan unka ilaaj ferdinand sourbrukh dwaara kiya gaya
 Stauffenberg had to lose the left eye, right hand, and two fingers of the left hand
 He would jokingly tell his friends that even when he had all the fingers, he still did not know what to do with all these fingers
 apni choton ke liye, stoffenberg ko 14 april ko swarna main wund baij se sammanit kiya gaya or 8 may ko unke saahas ke liye swarna main german cross diya gaya
 For rehabilitation, Stauffenberg was sent to his home, Schloss Lautlingen at the time, which was the Stauffenberg Palace in southern Germany
 prarambh main, ve is baat se niraash hue ki ve khud ek takhtapalat karne kii sthiti main nahin hai
 But from early September of 1943, after recovering from his wounds, he was stationed by conspirators and was met by Henning von Treskov, a staff officer for the headquarters of Ersatzheer, which was located at Bendlästraस्ट्राe in Berlin 
 vahaan, stoffenberg kaa ek varisht tha general fredrick olbrisht jo pratirodh aandolan kaa ek patibaddh sadsy tha
 Ersatzheer had a unique opportunity to launch a coup, as one of his tasks was to organize Operation Valkyrie
 yah ek apaat upaay tha jo unhen us halaat main rike kaa niyantran hasil karne detaa jab aantarik gadabadi ucch sainya shashan tak sanchaar ko avaruddh kar de
 The irony was that Hitler had agreed to the Valkyrie plan, which was now secretly converted to aim to wipe out the rest of his regime after his death
 ek vistrut sainya yojana ko na sirf berlin par kabja karne ke liye viksit kiya gaya, balki 1943 main navambar ke ant main excel von dame bushe dwaara purv prashia main hitler kii aatmghaatee hatya ke baad sainya baalo dwaara vibhinn german mukhyalayon par kabja karne ke liye bhi banaaya gaya
 Stauffenberg planned to personally deliver these written orders by Won Dame Bushe to Major Kun when he reached Wolfshanz near Rastenburg in East Prussia
 However, after the meeting with Hitler was canceled, von Dame Busche left Wolfshanz for the Eastern Front and could not be attempted
 kun ne in gupt dastavejon ko OKW sthit ek nigaraanee tower ke neeche chupaaya tha, jo volfshans se zyada dur nahin tha
 After the 20 July conspiracy, Kun became the Soviet Union's prisoner of war
 vah farvari 1945 main dastavejon ko chhipaane ke sthaan par soviet sangh ko le gaya
 In 1989, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev delivered the documents to the then German Chancellor Dr
 Helmut Kohl
 in dastavejon ne jinhen 1943 main stoffenberg or unke saathi adhikariyon dwaara berlin main prastut kiya gaya, pratirodh samooh kii adarshavaadi prerana kaa khulaasa kiya
 This was suspected and the subject of discussion for years in Germany after the war
 kuch logon kaa maananaa tha ki sajeeshkarta hitler ko isliye samaapt karnaa chaahate the taaki ve yuddh ko samaapt kar saken or peshewar adhikariyon ke rup main apane visheshadhikaar ke nuksaan ko bachaa saken
 On 6 June 1944, the Allies arrived in France on Independence Day
 adhikansh anya german peshewar sainya adhikariyon kii tarah stoffenberg ko bhi bilkul koi shaq nahin tha ki yuddh haara ja chukaa he
 Only an immediate ceasefire can save unnecessary bloodshed and more damage to Germany, its people and other European countries
 haalanki, 1943 ke ant main, unhone kuch maange rakhi jo unke vichaar se germany dwaara tatkaal shanti par sahamat hone ke liye mitra rashtron dwaara anupaalan aavashyak he
 These demands included that Germany would retain its eastern borders of 1914 including the Polish territories of Wilkopolska and Poznaान
 Other demands included the Raik's capture of Austria and Sudetanland's territorial gains and the autonomy of alsace-lorraine and the expansion of the current warring borders of Germany in the south by occupying Terrol as far as Bolzano and Meran
 Non-territorial demands included the denial of occupation of any part of Germany by the Allies, as well as the refusal to hand over war criminals who would be dealt with in that country
 in prastaavon ko keval pashchimi mitra rashtron ke liye nirdeshit kiya gaya tha - stoffenberg chaahate the ki germany keval pashchimi, dakshini or purvi morchon se peeche hate, jabaki purv kii ore unhone pradeshik laabh ke liye german sainik kabje ko jari rakhane kii maang kii
 From early September 1943 until 20 July 1944, von Stauffenberg was the main driving force behind the plot to wipe out Hitler and take control of Germany
 apane sankalp, sanghathanaatmak kshamta or kattarpanthi drushtikon se unhone us niskriyata ko samaapt kar diya jo is andeh or charchaa se panpi thi ki kya hitler ke vyavhaar ne sainya usulon ko aprachlit kar diya he
 With the help of his friend Henning von Treskov, he united the conspirators and put them into action
 stoffenberg ko pataa tha ki german kanoon ke tahat, ve ek ucch rajdroh kar rahe the
 He openly told the conspirator Axel von Dame Bushe in late 1943, "ich betreibe mit allen mir zur Verfügung stehenden Mitteln den Hochverrat 


"
 He justified himself by citing his authority under natural law from Bushe to save the lives of millions from Hitler's criminal aggression
 jab shadyantrkaari general helmuth steeff ne salzaburg ke paas cleshim mahal main 7 july 1944 ko ghoshnaa kii ki ve hitler kii htya karne main asamarth hai to stoffenberg ne berlin main sajeesh rachate hue hitler ko vyaktigat rup se maarane kaa faisla kiya
 By then, Stauffenberg had great doubts about the possibility of success
 tresco ne unhen safalataa naa milane kii sthiti main bhi aage badhane ke liye aashwast kiya or kaha, "htya kaa prayaas kiya hi janaa chahie
 agar yah vifal bhi hota he, tab bhi hamen berlin main karrwai kerani chahie", kyonki yahi ek tarika jisase ham duniya ko bataa sakate hai ki hitler kaa shashan or germany ek nahin he or samaan bhi nahin hai or yah ki saare german vaasiyon ne sarkaar kaa samarthan nahin kiya tha
 According to the original plan, Stauffenberg was to stay at the Bendelstraसेe offices in Berlin, so that he could regularly call the unit in Europe and convince them to arrest the leaders of Nazi organizations such as Sicherheitdinst and the Gestapo
 Unfortunately, when General Helmuth Steph, who was the Chief of Operations in the Army High Command and who had regular access to Hitler, pulled out of his former commitment to kill Hitler, Stauffenberg was forced to assume two important roles
 : Killing Hitler away from Berlin and preparing military machinery during office hours on the same day
 Apart from Steph, he was the only conspirator who regularly met Hitler until mid-1944, as well as the only officer with the resolve and ability to persuade German military leaders after Hitler's death 
 is aavashyaktaa ke kaaran ek safal takhtapalat kaa avasar kam tha
 When Göring and Himmler were together after several unsuccessful attempts by Stauffenberg to meet Hitler, Stauffenberg proceeded to Wolfshanze on 20 July 1944 to carry out his plot
 Stauffenberg entered the briefing room carrying a briefcase containing two small bombs
 milane ke sthaan ko apratyaashit rup se bhumigat foorarbunkar se badal kar spir ke lakdi ke barrack / jhopadi main kar diya gaya
 He left the room to prepare the first bomb with special customized pliers, a task that became difficult for him as he had no right hand and lost three fingers of his left hand
 ek guard ne dastak di or daravaaza kholaa or unase jaldi chalane ko kaha kyonki baithak shuru hone vaali thi,
 natijatan, stoffenberg keval ek bam taiyaar karne main sakasham ho sake
 unhone doosraa bam apane shivi sahyogi, warner won heften ke saath chhod diya or brifing kamare main laut aae, jahaan unhone us ataichi ko mej ke neeche rakh diya, hitler ke jitna paas ho saktaa tha utana
 kuch minute baad, unhone maafi maangi or kamare se baahar nikal gaye
 After exiting, the briefcase was removed by Colonel Heinz Brandt
 jab visphot ne jhopadi ko udaaya, to stoffenberg ko vishwaas ho gaya ki kamare main koi nahin bachaa hoga
 haalanki chaar log maare gaye or lagbhag sabhi ghayal hue, hitler khud baari, thos ok mej dwaara visphot ke prabhaav se batch gaye or keval thodaa ghayal hue
 Stauffenberg and Haften soon left and arrived at a nearby airport
 berlin waapas aane ke baad, stoffenberg ne turant hi apane doston ko naaji netaaon ke khilaaf sainya takhtapalat karne kaa doosraa charan aarambh karne ko prerit kiya
 When Joseph Gobels announced by radio that Hitler had survived, and later, Hitler himself personally gave a speech on the radio, the conspirators realized that the coup had failed
 unhen unke bendelerstraase karyaalayon main khoj nikaala gaya or thodi der chali goli-bari ke baad, jiske dauraan stoffenberg ke kandhe main goli lag gai, unhen pakad liya gaya
 In a futile attempt to save his life, the General Conservator Frederick Fromm, co-conspirator at Bendlerblack, commander-in-chief of the Replacement Army, charged the other conspirators in an urgent court martial and beheaded the ringleaders
 Stauffenberg and fellow officers Colonel General Olbrisht, Lieutenant von Heften and Oberst Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim were shot just before 1:00 that night by a temporary firing team by burning the truck's headlights in a courtyard in Bendlerblack
 maare jane waalon main stoffenberg pankti main teesraa tha, jiske baad leftinent won heften the
 However, when Stauffenberg's turn came, Lieutenant von Heften himself got in between Stauffenberg and Goli and was killed by Stauffenberg's bullets
 jab unki baari ai, to stoffenberg ne apane aakhri shabdon ko kaha, "es lebe Unser Deutschland heiliges!" dusron kaa kahana he ki aakhri shabd the: "es lebe das geheime Deutschland!" from ne aadesh diya ki maare gaye adhikariyon ko ko berlin ke shonatorg jile main mathous qabristaan main sainik sammaan ke saath tatkaal dafan kiya jaae
 agle din, tathaapi, stoffenberg ke sharir ko SS dwaara khod kar nikaala gaya, unke padak chin liye gaye or unka dah sanskaar kar diya gaya
 Another main figure in this plot is Stauffenberg's elder brother Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg
 On 10 August 1944, Berthold was tried in a special "janata Court" before Judge President Roland Frasler
 is adaalat ko hitler dwaara raajnneetik aparaadhon ke liye sthapit kiya gaya tha
 Berthold was one of the eight conspirators who were strangled to death later that day in Plotzency Prison, Berlin
 More than two hundred people were charged with pretense and killed
 hitler ne 20 july kii sajeesh ko ek bahaane ke rup main prayog kiya or aise kisi bhi shaks kaa safaya karvaa diya jisase use virodh kaa bhay tha
 The traditional salute was replaced with the Nazi Sig Hel
 is safaaye main antat 20,000 ko maar diya gaya yaa kansantreshan shiviron main bhej diya gaya
 The fact that Klaus Philippe Maria Justinian Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg was a soldier and German nationalist cannot be denied
 yah tathy bhi vivaadit nahin he ki vah ek aitihaasik kuleen parivaar se the, jiske ve ek sadsy the
 He was a decorated military and military leader, a nobleman by birth and revealing Christianity
 At one point he did not believe in the direction of the National Socialist regime, although he was initially supportive and preferred Hitler's "appointment" as Chancellor
 unhone poland par akraman or yahudee prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye atyaacharon unhen yaa dusron par pravrutt kaa samarthan kiya
 Professor Richard J
 Evans, Regius Professor of History at the University of Cambridge, has written three books on the Third Rike and includes many such aspects
 unhone ek lekh likhaa jo aalekh mul rup se syu dauyashaland zatung main 23 janvari 2009 main prakashit kiya gaya tha, jiskaa sheershak tha whai did stoffenberg plant da bam?, or kaha ki kya isliye kyonki hitler yuddh main haar rahaa tha? yaa phir yahudiyon kii samuhik hatya kaa ek ant karne ke liye tha
 Or is it to save Germany's honor? Whatever his motives, he was not a model for future generations
 " shaayad usamen bhi apane vanshanugat badppan kii raksha karne or use sthapit karne kii koshish kii ichha thi? yah tathy ki vah dwaara ek hero or satta main sarkaar dwaara ek gaddaar mana jaataa tha, dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 uske desh ke logon dwaara hitler ko "baari samarthan, sahansheeltaa, yaa chup maun sweekruti" jise baari dabaaya gaya or lagaataar prachaar par bhi dhyaan diya janaa chahie

 unhone bhi ek lekh likhaa jo syudadauyashe zatung main 30 janvari 2010 ko prakashit hua, unka vichaar tha ki evan kii raay haalanki sahmati he, vah aitihaasik lekhan ke apane adhikansh main sahi hai, unhone kai panktiyon or samay or pahaluon ke bich main kuch galat prastut kiya he, vah ivance par likhte hai, "apane tark ke samasyagrast path main vah do jaal bunate hai: 1
 stoffenberg ke "naitik prerana" par sawaal, 2
 role model ke rup main stoffenberg kii upyuktata
" unhone aage likhaa he, "to agar, praarambhik nishpakshta ke saath ivance jo likhte hai, stoffenberg main ek majboot naitik prerana thi - chaahe vah uske abhijaat sammaan se ubhari ho, catholic siddhant yaa romantic kavita se - to isse bhi unke rashtriya samaajwaad ko kam kar ke aanka gaya jise stoffenberg ne galat rup main 'aadhyatmik naveekaran' ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 Was Klaus eventually a hero or a traitor? Today, there is a memorial to this event
 1980 main german sarkaar ne asafal naaji-virdohi pratirodh aandolan kaa ek smarak bendlerblock main banaaya, jiske shesh main vartmaan main german raksha mantralay he bendlerstraase kaa naam badal kar stoffenbergstrose kiya gaya or ab bendlerblo main german pratirodh kaa smarak sthit he, jisamen hitler yug ke dauraan uske virodh main shaamil 5000 se adhik vibhinn tasviren or dastavejon kii pradarshnee he
 The courtyard where the officers were shot on 21 July 1944 is now a memorial site, a plaque commemorating the events and a statue of a young man resembling Count von Stauffenberg
 stoffenberg ne mumberg main 26 sitambar 1933 main nina fran von lerchenfield se vivaah kiya
 They had five children: Berthold, Hymeran; franz-ludwig, Valerie and Konstanz, who was born Frankfurt on the Order years after Stauffenberg's death
 berthold, himran, franj-ludwig or vaileri, jinhen unke pita ke krityon ke bare main nahin bataaya gaya tha, unhen yuddh ke shesh samay ek paalak ghar main rakhaa gaya or majabuuran unka kulanaam badal diya gaya, kyonki stoffenberg ab nishedh mana jaataa tha
 Nina died on 2 April 2006 at Kirchlauter, near Bamberg, at the age of 92 and was buried on 8 April
 berthold yuddh pashchaat ke boondesvar main pashchim germany main general bana or franz ludwig, german or europea sansad, donon kaa ek sadsy bana
 In 2008, Konstanz von Schulthes Raschberg wrote a best-selling book on his mother, Nina Schenk graffin von Stauffenberg
 apane mrit pati ke varnan main nina won stoffenberg kahati hai: He would let things happen and then he made up his mind


 one of his characteristics was that he really liked being a satrapist

 bahari rup main dekhne par naak va mukh ek sampoorn ang ke rup main hi dikhaai dete hai, unke alag−alag hisse dikhaai nahin dete
 But in fact these organs are divided into many parts
 haalanki nitalacavity marottege or netleceptor dekhne main to alag−alag dikhaai dete hai parantu peeche jaakar gale kii andar aapas main ek cavity main mil jate hai jise 'oropheringells' kehete hai
 The posterior part of the nose above the oropharyngeals is called the 'lezoferringles'
 tonsil kii samasya kaa kaaran kisi bhi prakaar kaa sankraman yaa infections ho saktaa he jo hamaare sharir main mukh va naak se pravesh kar rahaa ho
 These pollution or infection can cause problems immediately when air contaminated with any type of viral or bacterial pollutants enters the body through the breath
 aise sthaan jahaan ke vaataavaran main badboo, sillen tathaa anya kisi rasinic tatv kaa samavesh ho aise sthanon main vaayu ke dwaara nirantar jahrile tatwon ke sampark main aane ke kaaran tonsil rog kii samasya khadi ho sakati he
 More cases of this disease are seen in children because their immunity is less
 aisa nahin ki badi umr ke log isse grasit nahin ho sakate unamem bhi yah samasya dekhi ja sakati he
 Tonsillitis is a dangerous condition of the disease because the body reacts due to antibodies
 is avasthaa main jaise hi antigen hamaare sharir main pravesh karata he vaise hi tonsil tishyu usase ladanaa shuru kar dete hai isse jo antigen banataa he vah sharir ke anya bhaagon main upasthit protein ke saath pratikriya karke vahaan bhi isi prakaar ke antibadis bana detaa he
 These antibodies have a direct effect on the heart valves and pose a risk of heart valve deterioration
 tonsil to zyaadaatar bacchon ko hota he parantu iskaa dil par padane vaala dushprabhav kisi bhi umr main pad saktaa he
 Inadequate treatment of throat infections in childhood is also a cause of heart diseases in our country
 iske atirikt tonsil se bairaphengills epashish, neutrapheringles epashish jaisi bimaariyaan bhi ho sakati hai
 This problem arising due to disturbances in the mechanical structure of the body due to toxic elements can be identified by looking at some initial symptoms like- Frequent sore throat, sore throat, pain, recurrent fever etc
 yadi aise hi lakshan rogi ko baar−baar ho rahe hon
 For example, five or six times a year, he should have a tonsil operation done
 lager aaparishan main do se teen ghante kaa samay lagata he or bilkul cheer−faad nahin hoti
 To avoid tonsils, it is important that children are given a balanced diet so that their body's immunity is strong
 sabase jaruri to yah he ki tonsil ke lakshan dikhte hi turant doctor se sampark karen
 The course of medicine given by the doctor should be completed
 aksar log thodaa sa aaraam milte hi dawaai band kar dete hai parantu aisa karnaa rog ko or adhik ugr bana detaa he
 During this disease, the patient has difficulty in swallowing food and water
 aise main bahut se log kam khate hai, yah thik nahin he
 Continue to serve soft or liquid foods to meet the needs of the patient's body
 isse sharir kii rog pratirohak kshamta bani rahati he
 Kalibanga is an ancient and historical site in Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan
 yahaan hadappa sabhyataa ke bahut dilachasp or mahatvapurn avshesh mili hai
 Kali Banga was a small town
 yahaan ek durg mila he
 From the remains of 26 feet high Western Thedi by Ukhn at Kalibanga place in Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan, it is known that the Harappan civilization flourished on the banks of river Saraswati here about 4500 years ago
 kalibanga hanumangarh zile main pilibanga ke nikat sthit he
 This place was situated on the banks of the ancient river Saraswati
 yah nadi ab ghagghar nadi ke rup main he
 Sutlej used to be contained in northern Rajasthan
 suratgarh ke nikat nauhar-bhaadaraa kshetra main saraswati va drushadwati kaa sangam sthal tha
 Due to its vastness, the Indus River itself took the form of a sea in the rain, which is clear from its nomenclature
 hamaare desh bharat main "sindhu sabhyataa" kaa mulat: udbhav vikaas evam prasar "saptsindhav" pradesh main hua tathaa saraswati upatyaka kaa usamen vishisht yogadan he
 The Saraswati Upatyaka was the holy region of "brahmavart" situated between Saraswati and Drishadvati which according to Manu was "devised"
 dhanadhanya se paripurna is kshetra main vaidic richaon kaa udbodhan bhi hua
 Saraswati was good in rivers and entered the sea from Giri
 rugveda main kaha gaya he-"ekachatat saraswati nadi naam shuchiryatu
 Girbhya: Asamudrat
 
 "sutlej used to be contained in Saraswati in northern Rajasthan
 si
epa
 olden ne aitihaasik or bhugolic tathyon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki ghagghar nadi ke ghat par rugveda main bahane vaali nadi saraswati 'drushadwati' thi
 Then the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers did not flow in their present rivers and flowed into the rivers of Ghaggar and Hakra
 mahabharat kaal tak saraswati lupt ho chuki thi or 13 veen shatee tak satluj, vyas main mil gai thi
 Saraswati dried up in the sandy part due to reduced water content
 olden mahoday ke anusaar satluj or yamuna ke bich kai choti-badi nadiyaan nikalati hai
 Among them were Chautang, Markanda, Saraswati etc
 ye nadiyaan aaj bhi varsha ritu main pravaahit hoti hai
 These rivers near Rajasthan take the form of a large river Ghaggar
 aage chalakar yah nadi pakistan main hakaraa, vaahid, naaraa naamon se jaani jaati he
 These rivers are dry today - but their route can be seen from Rajasthan to Karachi and east to the Gulf of Kutch
 vakankar mahashay ke anusaar saraswati nadi ke tat par 200 se adhik nagar based the, jo harappakalin hai
 For this reason, it should be called 'saraswati river civilization' in place of 'sindhughati civilization'
 mulat: ghagghar-hakaraa hi pracheen saraswati nadi thi jo satluj or yamuna ke sanyukt gujarat tak bahati thi jiskaa paat brahmaputra nadi se badhkar 8 kimi tha
 According to Vakankar, the Saraswati river met Luni via Nagaur, Lunasar, Osian, Didwana, 2 lakh 50 thousand years ago, from where it used to fall in the Kandh of Kannada near Lothal in the Rann of Kutch in the east, but 40,000 years
 Earlier the first earthquake occurred due to which the Saraswati river route was changed, through the Ghaggar river route, and Hanumangarh and Bahawalpur area of suratgarh parallel to the Indus river
 Shree used to meet the sea in the Kutch plain
 mahabharat kaal main kaurav-pandav yuddh isi ke tat par ladaa gaya
 At the same time, after the extinction of Saraswati, Yamuna started meeting in the Ganges

 main rakhaldas banji evam dayaram saahani ke netritv main muan jo dado evam hadappa ke utpann dwaara hadappa yaa sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke avshesh mili the jinase 4500 varsh purv kii pracheen sabhyataa kaa pataa chalaa tha
 Later about 100 centers of this civilization were found out of which Kalibanga region of Rajasthan is very important
 muan jo dado va hadappa ke baad hadappa samskruti kaa kalibanga teesraa bada nagar siddh hua he
 The following remains have been found as sources by excavation of a mound whose characteristics make clear their contribution in the development of Indian civilization - kalibanga main utkhann se praapt avasheshon main taanbe se nirmit auzaar, hathiyaar va murtiyan mili hai, jo yah prakat karti he ki maanav prastar yug se tamrayug main pravesh kar chukaa tha
 It was because of the copper black bangles found in it that it was called Kalibanga
 dhyatavya he ki punjabi main 'vanga' kaa arth chudi hota he, isliye kaali vanga arthath kaali chudiyaan
 Kalibanga has found seals made on the soil of the Indus Valley Civilization, which have pictures of Taurus and other animals and articles inscribed in the Hridhava script, which are yet to be read
 vah lipi daayen se baayein likhi jaati thi
 Milli are similar to Mohenjodo and Harappa
 pashuon main bail, bandar va pakshiyon kii murtiyan mili hai jo pashu-paalan, va krishi main bail kaa upyog kiya janaa prakat karata he
 Humans had learned to use weighing weights made of stone
 mitti ke vibhinn prakaar ke chote-bade bartan bhi praapt hue hai jin par chitrankan bhi kiya hua he
 It shows that 'charu' was being used to make utensils and through painting it expresses artistic tendency
 anek prakaar ke sree va purushon dwaara prayukt hone vaale kaanch, sip, shankh, ghonghon aadi se nirmit aabhushan bhi milen hai jaise kangan, chudiyaan aadi
 Like Kalyan and Harappan, houses like Moan which are built of sun-baked bricks, gates, wide roads, wells, drains etc
 are built according to the earlier plan, which is based on the town planning, cleaning, drinking water system etc
 Let's light up

 Inscribed lines have also been obtained from the plow obtained from Kalibanga which proves that the human here also used to do agricultural work
 isaki pushti bail va anya paaltu pashuon kii murtiyon se bhi hoti hai
 The bones of bull and reindeer have also been found
 baiylgaadee ke khilone bhi mili hai
 Metal and clay toys have also been obtained from the Muen, which are like Dara and Harappa, which show the fascination for children's entertainment
 muan jo dado va hadappa kii bhanti kalibanga se matrudevi kii murti nahin mili he
 In its place, the rectangular circular and oval Agnaveedis and the bones of the bull, Barsinghe reveal that the human here also offered animal sacrifices in the yagna
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke anya kendro se bhinn kalibanga main ek vishaal durg ke avshesh bhi mili hai jo yahan ke maanav dwaara apanaae gaye surakshatmak upayon kaa pramaan he
 Kalibanga and Indus Valley have their own special place as sources of the above mentioned remains
 kuch puratatvetta to saraswati tat par based hone ke kaaran kalibanga sabhyataa ko 'saraswati ghati sabhyataa' kahana adhik upyukt samajhate hai kyonki yahan kaa maanav pragaitihaasik kaal main hadappa sabhyataa se bhi kai drushti se unnat tha
 Knowledge of farming, making fortification, protection, sacrifice etc
 are indicative of this advanced condition
 vastut: kalibanga kaa pragaitihaasik sabhyataa evam samskruti ke vikaas main yathesht yogadan rahaa he
