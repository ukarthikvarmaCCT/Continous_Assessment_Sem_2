 unhone apane patiyon ko rishi gautam kaa apkaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Those Brahmins worshiped Lord Shree Ganeshji for this

 On hearing this, Ganeshji persuaded him to ask for such a bridesmaid
 kintu ve apane aagrah par atal rahe
 Eventually Ganeshji was forced to obey him
 apane bhakton kaa man rakhane ke liye ve ek durbal gaay kaa rup dhaaran karke rishi gautam ke khet main jaakar rahane lage
 Seeing the cow grazing the crop, the sage took a straw in his hand with great softness and grabbed it to grab it
 un trinon kaa sparsh hote hi vah gaay vahiin marakar gir padi
 Now there was a big cry
 saare brahman ekatra ho go-hatyara kahkar rishi gautam kii bhartsana karne lage
 Rishi Gautam was very surprised and saddened by this incident
 ab un saare brahmanon ne kaha ki tumhen yah ashram chhodkar anyatra kahin dur chale janaa chahie
 Staying close to the cow-killer will also cause us sin
 vivash hokar rishi gautam apni patni ahilya ke saath vahaan se ek kos dur jaakar rahane lage
 But those Brahmins made their stay there too difficult
 ve kehane lage- 'go-hatya ke kaaran tumhen ab veda-paath or yagyadi ke kaary karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin rah gaya
 'sage Gautama prayed to the Brahmins that you guys should give me some measure of my atonement and salvation

 Then return and fast here for a month

 According to the Brahmins, Maharishi Gautama, after completing all those tasks, became fully engrossed with his wife and started worshiping Lord Shiva
 isse prasann ho bhagwaan shiv ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha
 Maharishi Gautam said to him- 'lord, i want you to free me from the sin of cow-slaughter
 ' bhagavan shiv ne kaha- 'gautam ! tum sarvatha nishpaap ho
 The crime of cow slaughtering was done fraudulently on you
 chal purvak aisa karwaane vaale tumhaare ashram ke brahmanon ko main dand dena chahta hoon

 The title of "vikramaditya" was received by many other later kings in Indian history, notably the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II and the emperor Hemachandra Vikramaditya
 raja vikramaditya naam, 'vikram' or 'aditya' ke samaas se bana he jiskaa arth 'parakram kaa surya' yaa 'surya ke samaan parakramee' he
 He is also known as Vikram or Vikramark
 hindu shishuon main 'vikram' namakaran ke badhate prachlan kaa shrey aanshik rup se vikramaditya kii lokapriyata or unke jivan ke bare main lokapriy lok kathaon kii do shrinkhalaaon ko diya ja saktaa he
 Anushruta Vikramaditya is a popular personality in both Sanskrit and regional languages of India
 unka naam badi aasaani se aisi kisi ghatana yaa smarak ke saath jod diya jaataa he, jinke aitihaasik vivaran agyaat hon, haalanki unke ird-gird kahaniyon kaa puraa chakra phala-phula he
 The two most popular Sanskrit series are the Vetal Panchvinsati or Betal Pachisi and the throne
 in donon ke sanskrit or kshetreey bhashaaon main kai roopantaran milte hai
 In the vampire tales, Betal recounts twenty-five stories, in which the king seeks to imprison Betal and he confuses the king with confusing tales, ending them with a question to the king
 vastutah pehle ek sadhu, raja se vinati karte hai ki ve vetaal se bina koi shabd bole use unke paas le aaen, nahin to vetaal ud kar waapas apni jagah chalaa jayega
 raja keval us sthiti main hi chup rah sakate the, jab ve uttar na jaanate hon, anyathaa raja kaa sir fat jaataa
 durbhagyavash, raja ko pataa chalata he ki ve uske saare sawaalon kaa jawaab jaanate hai; isiilie vikramaditya ko uljhan main daalane vaale antim sawaal tak, vetaal ko pakadaney or phir uske chhot jane kaa silsilaa choubees baar chalata he
 a conversion of these stories can be seen in katha-saritsagar
 singhaasana ke qisse, vikramaditya ke us singhaasana se jude hue hai jo kho gaya tha or kai sadiyon baad dhar ke parmaar raja bhoj dwaara baraamad kiya gaya tha
 King Bhoj himself was also very famous and this series of stories is about his efforts to ascend the throne
 is singhaasana main 32 putaliyaan lagi hui thim, jo bol sakati thim or raja ko chunauti detii hai ki raja keval us sthiti main hi singhaasana par baith sakate hai, yadi ve unke dwaara sunai jane vaali kahani main vikramaditya kii tarah udaar hai
 This brings up 32 attempts of Vikramaditya and Bhoj accepts his inferiority every time
 ant main putaliyaan unki vinamrata se prasann hokar unhen singhaasana par baithne detii hai
 Vikramaditya's story related to Shani is often presented in the Yakshagana of Karnataka state
 kahani ke anusaar, vikram navaratri kaa parv bade dhooma-dham se manaa rahe the or pratidin ek grah par vaad-vivaad chal rahaa tha
 The last day's debate was about Saturn
 brahman ne shani kii shaktiyon sahit unki mahanata or prithvi par dharm ko banaae rakhane main unki bhoomika kii vyakhya kii
 In the ceremony, the Brahmin also said that according to Vikram's birth chart, Saturn's entry into his twelfth house is considered to be the worst
 lekin vikram santusht nahin the; unhone shani ko mahaj lokkantak ke rup main dekha, jinhone unke pita, guru ko ksht diya tha
 Hence Vikram said that he is not ready to consider Shani worthy of worship
 vikram ko apni shaktiyon par, vishesh rup se apane devi maa kaa krupa paatr hone par bahut garv tha
 When he declined the worship of Shani in front of the assembly of Navratri celebrations, the Lord Shani became angry
 unhone vikram ko chunauti di ki ve vikram ko apni puja karne ke liye baadhya kar denge
 As Shani fell into the sky, Vikram said that it was his good luck and he had his blessings to face any challenge
 vikram ne nishkarsh nikaala ki sambhawatah brahman ne unki kundali ke bare main jo bataaya tha vah sach ho; lekin ve shani kii mahanata ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 Vikram assuredly said that "whatever is to happen, it will happen and what is not to happen will not happen" and he says that he accepts Saturn's challenge
 ek din ek ghode bechney vaala unke mahal main aayaa or kaha ki vikram ke rajya main uskaa ghoda kharidne vaala koi nahin he
 The horse had amazing characteristics - which reached the sky in one leap, and the earth in another
 is prakaar koi bhi dharti par ud yaa sawari kar saktaa he
 Vikram could not believe him, that is why he said that before paying the price of the horse, he would try to ride
 The seller agreed to this and Vikram sat on the horse and ran the horse
 According to the seller, the horse took them to the sky
 duusari chalaang main ghode ko dharti par aana chahie tha, lekin usne aisa nahin kiya
 Instead he drove Vikram some distance and threw him into the forest
 vikram ghayal ho gaye or vaapasi kaa rasta dhundhane kaa prayaas kiya
 He said that all this is his destiny, nothing can be more than this; They failed to recognize Saturn as a horse seller
 jab ve jangal main rasta dhudhane kii koshish kar rahe the, daakuon ke ek samooh ne un par hamalaa kiya
 They looted all his jewels and beat him up a lot
 Even then Vikram was distracted by the condition and started saying that the bandits have taken only his crown, not his head
 chalate-chalate ve pani ke liye ek nadi ke kinare pahunche
 The slippery ground took them into the water and the strong current dragged them far away
 kisi tarah dhire-dhire vikram ek nagar pahunche or bhukhe hi ek ped ke neeche baith gaye
 Just in front of the tree under which Vikram was sitting, there was a stingy shopkeeper's shop
 jis din se vikram us ped ke neeche baithe, us din se dukaan main bikri bahut bad gai
 Out of greed, the shopkeeper thought that having this person outside the shop earned so much money and decided to invite Vikram to the house and provide food
 bikri main lambey samay tak vruddhi kii aashaa main, usne apni putree ko vikram ke saath shaadi karne ke liye kaha
 bhojan ke baad jab vikram kamare main so rahe the, tab putree ne kamare main pravesh kiya
 She started waiting for Vikram to wake up near the bed
 dhire- dhire use bhi neend aane lagi
 He took off his ornaments and hung them on a nail with a picture of a duck
 vah so gai
 Upon waking, Vikram saw Chitra's duck swallowing his jewels
 jab ve apane dwaara dekhe gaye drishy ko yaad kar hi rahe the ki dukandaar kii putree jag gai or dekhati he ki uske gahane gaayab hai
 He calls his father and says that he is a thief
 vikram ko vahaan ke raja ke paas le jaaya gaya
 The king decided to cut Vikram's arms and legs and leave him in the desert
 When Vikram was unable to walk in the desert and was soaked in blood, a woman returning to her in-laws house in Ujjain saw and recognized him
 usne unki haalat ke bare main poochtacha kii or bataaya ki ujjainvasi unki ghudsawaari ke baad gaayab ho jane se kaaphi chintit hai
 She requests her in-laws to give them a place in their house and they keep them in her house
 uske parivaar vaale shramik varg ke the; vikram unase kuch kaam maangate hai
 They say that they will monitor the fields and hank so that the bulls rotate, separating the grains
 They do not want to be guests forever
 ek shaam jab vikram kaam kar rahe the, hawa se mombatti bujh jaati he
 They sing a lamp raga and light a candle
 isse saare nagar kii mombatiyaan jal uthati hai - nagar kii rajkumaari ne pratigya ki thi ki ve aise vyakti se vivaah karengi jo deepak raag gaakar mombatti jala sakegaa
 She is surprised to see the disabled man as the source of music, but still decides to marry her
 raja jab vikram ko dekhte hai to yaad karke aag-babula ho jate hai ki pehle un par chori kaa aarope tha or ab vah unki beti se vivaah ke prayaas main he
 He takes out his sword to cut Vikram's head
 us samay vikram anubhav karte hai ki unke saath yah sab shani kii shaktiyon ke kaaran ho rahaa he
 He prays to Shani before his death
 ve apni galatiyon ko sweekaar karte hai or sahmati jataate hai ki unamem apni haisiyat kii vajah se kaafii ghamand tha
 Shani appears and returns them to her jewels, hands, feet and everything
 vikram shani se anurodh karte hai ki jaisi pidaa unhone sahi he, waisi pidaa saamaanya jan ko naa den
 They say that even a strong person like him may suffer, but normal people will not be able to bear it
 shani unki baat se sahamat hote hue kehete hai ki ve aisa katai nahin karenge
 The king recognizes his emperor, surrenders to him and agrees to marry his daughter to him
 usee samay, dukandaar daud kar mahal pahunchataa he or kahata he ki batakh ne apane munh se gahane waapas ugal die hai
 He also hands over his daughter to the king
 vikram ujjain laut aate hai or shani ke aashirwad se mahaan samraat ke rup main jivan vyateet karte hai
 According to Indian tradition, Dhanvantari, Kshapanak, Amarasingh, Shank, Khatkarpara, Kalidas, Vetalbhatta, Varruchi and Varahamihira were part of the court of Vikramaditya in Ujjain
 kehete hai ki raja ke paas "navratna" kahalaane vaale nau aise vidwaan the
 Kalidas was a famous Sanskrit poet
 varahamihir us yug ke pramukh jyotishi the, jinhone vikramaditya kii bete kii maut kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi

 EQUALS page 7 by Chloe Challender and Amy North Issue 15 November December 2005 articles available to subscribers In the medical industry, the nebulizer is a device used to deliver the drug as a splash into the lungs
 nebuliser kaa upyog aamtaur par sistic fibrosis, asthma, siopidi or anya saans ke rogon ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Flammable smoking equipment or cannabis joints), a vaporizer, dry powder inhaler, or a pressurized measured inhaler can also be used to inhale the drug
 aajkal jvalansheel dhumrapaan upkarnon or veporiser kaa upyog dawa ko saans ke zariye andar lene ke liye nahin kiya jaataa he, kyonki aadhunik inheler or nebuliser adhik prabhavi hai
 The general technical principle for all nebulizers is the same, according to which oxygen, compressed air, or ultrasonic power is used to mix the solution of the drug into small aerosol droplets to inhale this solution directly from the mouth of the device
 
 The definition of an aerosol is "a mixture of gas and particle" and the best example of an aerosol found naturally is "mist"
 When nebulizers are used for inhalation therapy to deliver the drug directly to the lungs, it is important to note that the inhaled micro-droplets penetrate the narrow branches of the lower airways, if they are only 1 to 5 in diameter
 It is only up to the micrometer
 anyathaa inhen mukh guha ke dwaara hi avashoshit kar liya jayega, jiskaa prabhaav kam hota he
 Unfortunately not all currently available nebulizers are able to deliver aerosols in small droplets, thus they do not have sufficient efficiency to deliver the drug to the lungs
 sabase adhik istemaal kiye jane vaale nebuliser jet nebuliser hai, jinhen "automiters" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The jet nebulizer is attached to a compressor with the help of a tube, causing the compressed air or oxygen to flow rapidly through a liquid drug and transform it into an aerosol, which is now inhaled by the patient
 Is taken within
 aajkal chikitsak jet nebuliser ke bajaay apane rogiyon ke liye ek dabaavayukt maapi hui khuraaq ke inheler ) ko praathamikta dete hai, jet nebuliser adhik dhwani paidaa karata he or apane adhik vajan ke kaaran kam portable he
 However, jet nebulizer is commonly used in hospital for patients who are unable to use the inhaler, such as in severe cases of respiratory diseases and in severe cases of asthma
 The main advantage of Jet Nebulizer is that it costs less to operate
 agar kisi rogi ko ek pmdi ke upyog karke pratidin dawa ko inhele karne kii zarurat he to yah zyada mahangaa padataa he
 Today many manufacturers have been able to reduce the weight of the jet nebulizer to 635 grams and hence it has started to be labeled as a portable device
 sabhi pratispardhi inhalers or nebulisers kii tulana main, aaj bhi shor or baari vajan jet nebuliser kii sabase badi kami he
 The ultrasonic wave nebulizer was invented in 1964 as a new more portable nebulizer
 ek ultrasonic taran nebuliser main takanic yah he ki isamen ek electronic sandamitra hota he jo ucch aavruti kii ultrasonic tarangen utpann karata he, jiske kaaran ek pizoilactric element main yantric kampan hone lagata he
 This vibrating element remains in contact with a liquid reservoir and its high frequency vibration is sufficient to form a mist of vapor
 chanki ye baari vaayu compressor ke bajaay ultrasonic kampan se arosol kaa nirmaan karte hai, inkaa vajan 170 gram ke aasapaas hota he
 Another advantage is that ultrasonic vibration produces no sound at all
 in adhik aadhunik prakaar ke nebulisers ke udhaaharan hai: omron NE-U17 or neurar nebuliser IH30
 Another significant upgrade to the nebulizer market occurred around 2005, when ultrasonic vibrating mesh technology) was created
 is takanic main ek 1000-7000 leisure drill chhidron se yukt ek mesh / jhilli ek taral bhandar ke sheersh par compit hoti he or isse bahut choti boonden dhundh ke rup main chhidron se baahar nikalati hai
 This technique is more effective than vibrating a piezoelectric element under a liquid repository and also reduces healing time
 ultrasonic tarang nebuliser main ek samasya yah paayi gayi ki isamen taral bahut adhik vyarth hota he or chikitsakeey taral naa chaahate hue bhi garm ho jaataa he, yah samasya bhi kampan mesh nebuliser ke saath hal ho gayi he
 a partial list of available VMT nebulizers includes: Pari Efflow, Respironics i-neb, Omron Microarray, Bueller Nebulizer IH50 and arogene Aeronab
 chunki puraane modells kii tulana main ultrasonic VMT nebulisers kaa mulya adhik he, adhikansh nirmaataa "puraane jamaane" ke jet nebuliser bhi bechate hai
 The most recent innovation in nebulizer technology is a human-powered nebulizer developed by Lars E
 Olson, a doctor at Market University
 medical company bohringer ingelhem ne bhi 1997 main respimet soft mist inheler naamak ek nae upkaran kaa avishkaar kiya
 This new technology provides the user with a measured dose, as the liquid base of the inhaler is rotated in a counterclockwise direction at 180 degrees by hand, creating a tension in the spring around the elastic fluid vessel
 jab upyogkarta inheler ke aadhaar ko actevet karata he, spring se urja nikalati he or pratyasth taral ke paatr par dabaav daalati he, jisase taral spray ke rup main 2 nozals se baahar nikalataa he, is prakaar se ek soft mist kaa nirmaan hota he, jise inhele kiya jaataa he
 The device has no gas propellant and does not require any battery / power to operate
 The micro-droplet size in this sputter was disappointingly measured at 5
8 micrometers, the effective ability of the inhaled drug to reach the lungs
 Indicates some problem
 baad ke pareekshanon main yah siddh ho gaya ki maamla yah nahin tha
 In fact, the efficiency of the soft mist inhaler is higher than that of a conventional pmdi, due to the very low velocity of the sputter
 2000 main, nebuliser kii paribhaasha ko spasht / vistaarit karne ke liye europea shwasan socity ) ke liye kuch tark prastut kiye gaye, kyonki nae soft mist inheler ko takneekee shabdon main "ek haath se chalaaye jane vaale nebuliser" or "ek haath se chalaaye jane vaale pmdi" donon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 The first "powered" or pressurized inhaler was invented in France in 1858 by sales-girones
 yah upkaran taral dawa ko chote kanon main badalane ke liye dabaav kaa upyog karata tha
 The pump handle is operated like a bicycle pump
 jab pump ko upar khinchaa jaataa he, yah bhandar se taral ko khinch letaa he or upyogkarta ke haath se bal lagaaye jane par taral par ek atomiser ke madhyam se bal lagata he, jisase upyogkarta ke munh ke paas inhele karne ke liye spray kiya ja saktaa he
 The first steam-powered nebulizer was invented in Germany in 1864
 is inheler ko "seagal ke steam spray inheler" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo taral dawa ko atomise karne ke liye venchuri ke siddhant kaa upyog karata tha or yah nebuliser chikitsa kii bilkul praarambhik shuruyaat thi
 The importance of droplet size was not yet understood, so the efficacy of this first device was not understood for many medical compounds
 seagal ke steam spray main spirit kaa ek burner hota he, jo bhandar main upasthit pani ko garm kar use bhaap main badal detaa he, yah bhaap sheersh par bahati he or chikitsakeey vilyan main nilambit tub main se hokar nikalati he
 The steam flowing in this passage draws the medicine into the vapor and the patient inhales the sprayed vapor from a mouth made of glass
 pehle electronic nebuliser kaa avishkaar 1930 main kiya gaya or yah neumostate kehalaata he
 In this device, the therapeutic liquid is converted into aerosols with the help of electric compressors
 mahange electronic nebuliser ke ek vikalp ke rup main, haalanki 1930 main kai logon ne adhik saadhaaran or haath se chalaaye jane vaale nebuliser kaa upyog karnaa jari rakhaa, jise park-davis glaceptic ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 a competitive technique against nebulizers was introduced in 1956 by Riker Laboratories, as a pressurized measured dose inhaler, with its first two products being mediheler-iso and mediheeler-ap
 In these devices, the drug is cooled and delivered in a fixed dosage form through some special measuring valves, which are drawn by a gas propellant technique
 1964 main ek nae prakaar ke electronic nebuliser ko ek "ultrasonic tarang nebuliser" ke rup main shuru kiya gaya
 Today, nebulizer technology is not only used for medical purposes
 udhaaharan ke liye ultrasonic tarang nebuliser kaa upyog nami utpann karne vaale upkaran main bhi kiya jaataa he, jiskaa uddeshy hota he imaaraton main shushk vaayu ko nam banane ke liye jal arosol kaa spray karnaa
 In relation to electronic cigarettes, some previously designed models have an ultrasonic wave nebulizer with a vaporizer in combination
 haalanki vartmaan main electronic cigarette kaa sabase zyada bechaa jane vaala prakaar, ultrasonic tarang nebuliser ke chunaav kii sambhaavna ko kam karata he, chunki ise is prakaar ke upkaran ke liye paryaapt prabhavi nahin paaya gaya
 Electric vaporizers are now used instead of electronic cigarettes, either in direct contact with the absorbent material in the "inertial atomizer", or in combination with the nebulizer technology associated with the "spraying jet atomizer" is 
 nebuliser apni dawa ko taral vilyan ke rup main lete hai, jise aksar upyog ke samay upkaran main daalaa jaataa he
 Corticosteroid and bronchodilators such as salbutamol USAN) are often used and sometimes used in combination with ipratropium
 in dawaaon ko khaane ke bajaay inhele kiye jane kaa kaaran yah he ki inhele karne par ye sidhe shwasan maarg par apana kaam karti hai, jisase dawa apana kaam teji se karne lagati he or iske parshv prabhaav bhi kaam ho jate hai, iske bajaayaa khaane par inke parshv prabhaav zyada hote hai
 The drug, usually changed to aerosol, is inhaled through a tube-like mouth, similar to an inhaler
 haalanki, upkaran ke mukh kii jagah kabhi kabhi mask kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, yah kuch vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa nishchetak inhele karne ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he, isse chote bacchon main or bado main inheler kaa upyog karnaa adhik aasaan ho jaataa he, haalanki agar rogi sidhe upkaran ke mukh se dawa ko inhele kar saktaa he to mask ke bajaay sidhe mukh se hi inhele karnaa chahie, kyonki mask kaa upyog karne se fefdon tak kam dawa pahunch paati he, chunki yah naak main bhi fail jaati he
 After the use of corticosteroids, it is theoretically possible to have a yeast infection in the patient's mouth or a voice sore, although in practice such conditions rarely occur
 in pratikul prabhaavon se bachane ke liye, kuch chikitsakon suzav dete hai ki jo rogi nebuliser kaa upyog karte hai unhen acchhee tarah se kulla karnaa chahie
 haalanki, yah bronkodailator ke liye sach nahin he, phir bhi rogi kulla karnaa chaahate hai kyonki shwasan maarg ko failaane vaali dawaaon kaa swaad apriy hota he
 Instead of using a nebulizer to deliver therapeutic liquid into the lungs in the form of aerosol drops, an inhaler or vaporizer may also be used
