 It is due to brain development that man developed language, as a result of which he can store knowledge

 Naturalism is a philosophical ideology that considers matter to be the basis and reality and the world, creatures and human beings are all created from it
 is vichaardhaara ke pramukh pravartak ke rup main saamanytah ruso kaa hi naam liya jaataa he
 Although Russo strongly raised the slogan of naturalism, he was also influenced by ideological philosophers like Plato
 uske vichaar platon se prabhavit the
 So the nature of Rousseau's naturalism seems to be built on the background of idealistic objectives
 brubekar kaa aisa vichaar he ki ruso ek romantic prakrutivaadee tha
 We cannot call Russians naturalists on the basis of the interests and qualifications of the child, away from bondage, system of education at the natural site, etc
 kyonki yadi maatr balak kii swaabhaavik ruchi par bal dene tathaa prakruti se prem ke bal par yadi ruso ko prakrutivaadee kaha ja saktaa he to hamen plato ko bhi isi shrenee main sammilit karnaa hoga
 Philosophers like Rusk, Donald Butler, etc
 believe that Herbert Spencer is indeed a naturalist
 bekan evam camenius bhi prakrutivaadee vichaardhaara se jude prathit hote hai
 However, Spencer and the Russians can only be credited for bringing naturalism to its peak
 ruson ke sambandh main aashcharya vyakt karte hue rabart harbart ne likhaa he ki ruso jaise patit vyakti kaa itnaa prabhaav aashcharya janak he
 Since the Russians were also a part of the corrupt society, it was bound to be a moral fall
 atah ruso ne tatkaaleen samaaj ke vishay main saarvbhaumik kathan kah daalaa, - ‘manushya kii santhaayen virdohi tatwon evam bhuulon kaa pind he
 And by working against the rules established by the society, the right work will be possible
 ’ ruson ne ‘prakruti kii ore lauto’ kaa jo naaraa diya usase yahi sanket nikalataa he ki vah chaatro ko dooshit samaaj se dur gaanv kii prakritik chhatra chaaya main le janaa chahta tha
 In fact, this 'debate' took place as a result of the 'revolution' taking place in the social, economic, religious and educational fields of 18th century Europe
 yah kranti vishesh rup se tatkaaleen roodhiwaadita evam andh vishwaason se grasit dharmik sansthaaon ke viruddh hui thi
 Mechanical naturalism gave rise to behavioral psychology according to which every human being is born with some spontaneous actions
 jab ye sahaj kriyaayein bahya paryaavaran ke sampark main aati hai to sambaddh sahaj kriyaaon kaa nirmaan hota he ye sambaddh sahaj kriya manushya ko vibhinn kaary main sahaayta pradaan karti hai
 Therefore mechanistic naturalists believe that the aim of education is to generate appropriate and useful related spontaneous actions in humans
 jeev vigyaan ke siddhanton main vishwaas rakhane vaale prakrutivaadiyon ke anusaar shiksha kaa charam lakshya sukh evam anand kii prapti karana he kintu macdugal mahoday ne yah siddh kiya tha ki ham mul pravritiyon ke kaaran kaary karte hai, sukh dukh to pratifal hai
 Therefore, the aim of education is to transform and refine the basic trends, so that a new harmony can be created by redirection and integration of the student's tendencies so that he can conduct in a manner which is compatible with social and moral values
 jeevigyaanvaadiyon ke anusaar prayek praani main jeene kii ichha hoti he
 And to protect his life he always has to struggle with his environment
 darwin ne is sambandh main do siddhanth diye hai - jivan ke sangharsh tathaa samarth kaa astitv
 Therefore, Darwin wants to make man powerful and powerful, so that he can achieve success in the life struggle
 kintu lamark ke anusaar vaataavaran ke anuroop parivartan sheeltaa ke gunon keeshiksha dena hi uchit uddeshy he
 People like Bernard Shaw want to accelerate the evolutionary pace of nature
 isliye saamaajik athwa jaateey viraasat ke rup main praapt samskruti ko ek peedi se duusari peedi tak pahunchaana tathaa unka sangrakshan karnaa shiksha kaa uddeshy nirdhaarit kiya he
 According to the principle of happiness and sorrow, a man does things that are pleasurable and tries to avoid those who give grief
 yah baat sahi nahin he kyonki manushya kabhi kabhi kartavya ke liye praan bhi de detaa he
 In this regard, T

 The idea of the nun sir seems more expedient
 yadhyapi nan mahoday adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke adhik samarthak hai kintu shiksha ke uddeshy ke sambandh main unhone jeev vaigyanik evam prakrutivaadee drushtikon se vichaar kiya he
 According to him, the main objective of education is to develop the human personality independently
 nan ke anusaar vaiyaktikta se taatpary aatmanubhuti or aatm prakaashan he
 Thus, the aim of education is to help in the free and inhibited development of the innate powers inherent in the individual
 is sambandh main do vichaar vyakt kiya jaataa he
 The proponents of the first idea are Woodsworth, according to which the child comes from heaven in luminous form, but by coming here he loses his glory, because he is an ignorant child
 isliye uske vartmaan sukhon se yukt shiksha kaa prabandh hona chahie
 The second idea is that of people like Jeremiah etc
 who consider the child to be the cause of sin and only by keeping him in strict discipline, ending his natural instincts is the method of education and aiming to be God-oriented
 kintu is vichaar ko adhik mahatv nahin diya ja saktaa he kyonki yah vichaar pashavik prathit hota he
 According to this ideology, the education of a child should be dependent on his nature, at whose core lies primitive emotion, fundamental desires and natural attitudes
 vaastavik shiksha to vah he jo balak kii ruchi, yogyata evam jhukaav ke anuroop ho
 Discipline and bonding should be of little name to the child
 prakrutivaadee balak ko vastutah nirmanonmukh maanav maanate hai na ki use maanav kaa ek laghu rup
 His nature continues to evolve
 isliye sabhi ko in uddeshyon kii purti kii ore hi vishesh dhyaan dena chaiye
 The narrative of the naturalist curriculum comes from Spencer's book
 unke paathyakram kii visheshta yah he ki sampoorn paathyakram kaa aadhaar vigyaan mana gaya he
 According to Spencer, it is possible to live a holistic life only through science
 samgr jivan ke uddeshy kii purti ke liye spencer ne nimnlikhit paathyakram prastut kiya he
 Teachers used to be active in the ancient learning method
 baalkon kaa sthaan gaun tha kintu balak kii kriyasheeltaa par adhik bal prakrutivaadiyon ne diya
 They oppose the method of rote and passive practice and emphasize the use of methods based on the principles of 'learning by doing' and 'learning by experience'
 iske atirikt prakrutivaadee vichaardhaara ne project methd, scout, aandolan, skool union, balak club ityadi ko janm diya
 Naturalists pay special importance to the following principles of teaching method: prakrutivaadee shiksha main shikshak ko gaun sthaan praapt he
 Naturalist thinkers consider nature to be the real teacher
 unke vichaar se balak ko samaaj se dur rakhkar prakritik vaataavaran main shiksha praapt karne kaa avasar dena chahie
 According to the Russians, the influence of society's misgivings on the teacher is so much that even if he tries to make his children virtuous, he cannot make them virtuous because he himself is not virtuous
 isliye ruson balak kii aarmabhik shiksha main shikshak ko koi sthaan nahin dena chaahate
 Other naturalists do not accept the excesses of Rousseau
 ve baalkon kii shiksha main shikshak kii bhoomika maatr sahaayak evam path pradarshak ke rup main maanate hai
 Therefore teacher should have knowledge of psychology
 balak kii manokamanaayen, aavashyaktaaen ruchiyaan tathaa unke maansik vikaas kaa use parigyaan hona chahie
 It is necessary for the teacher to know the self-spontaneous actions of the child
 kyonki chaatr in swatah shaktiyon dwaara apni shiksha swayan karata he, shikshak to keval uchit paristhitiyon kaa sangyojan maatr karata he
 If the learning result is pleasant, then the child enjoys learning
 tathaa ukt shaikshik anubhav kii baar baar aavriti karata he
 The teacher is expected to create a customized environment for the child
 ruso ke anusaar skool swayan ek vishesh prakaar kaa samaaj he
 By this society, children are made worthy of future society
 isi samaaj dwaara vah swanushasan kii bhaavana sikhta he
 Prepares itself to lead and fulfill naturalistic objectives
 is prakaar ke schuli samaaj kaa bandhan kathor nahin hota
 Although Russo imagines a student and a teacher in the school
 saamanytah prakrutivaadee kisi prakaar se aupchaarik shiksha kaa virodh karte hai, isiilie isamen vidhyalay ko koi mahatvapurn sthaan na dekar baalkon ko dooshit vaataavaran se dur or prakritik vaataavaran ke bich rahakar shiksha praapt karne ko kaha gaya he
 It is because of these ideas that naturalist thinkers do not want schools to have institutions with artificial rigid and firm bonds
 prakrutivaadiyon ke anusaar skool main paathyakram evam sahagaami kriyaaon ityadi se sambandhit vishyon kii vyavastha main baalkon kaa bhi pratinidhitiv aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, they should be given the freedom to arrange their own programs for excursion, traveling, sports, scouting, social service etc
 shikshakon ko keval path pradarshak kii bhoomika kaa nirvahan karnaa chahie
 Naturalist thinkers do not value discipline in education
 ve ‘kaaran evam parinaam’ ke niyam main vishwaas karte hai
 According to him, every person who performs karma, he surely suffers the result
 ye parinaam sukhkar evam dukhakar donon hi hote hai
 On this basis, two bye-laws of discipline appear - ruso ke siddhanth ke anusaar balak ke bure kaaryon kaa dand prakruti avashya detii he
 Therefore, he should not be allowed to be disciplined by natural punishment by giving any kind of punishment, while according to the principle of Spencer, the child wants to repeat the pleasurable works again and again
 kyonki usase use sukh kii anubhuti hoti he jabaki vah dukhad kaaryon ko chhod detaa he, kyonki usase use ksht hota he
 In this way, the child starts behaving in a disciplined manner and a sense of self-discipline starts developing in him
 kuch prakrutivaadee vichaarak shiksha vyavastha main anushaasan kii sthapana hetu kisi bhi prakaar ke ‘damanaatmak siddhanth’ kaa virodh karte hai
 He believes that teachers especially have an impact on children
 isliye baalkon main anushaasan kii bhaavana viksit karne hetu ‘prabhavatmak siddhanth kaa sahaara lenaa chahie, jabaki anek prakrutivaadee vichaarak yah maanate hai ki anushaasan kii sthapana prakritik niyamon ke anusaar ho to zyada acha hota he
 On this basis, it can be said that the naturalists lay special emphasis on 'free radical theory' for the development of self-governance among children

 sankramak rog, rog jo kisi naa kisi rogajanit karko jaise protozoa, kavak, jeevanu, virus ityadi ke kaaran hote he
 Infectious diseases have the ability to spread from one body to another
 malaria, typhoid, chechak, influenza ityadi sankramak rogon ke udhaaharan hai
 The World Health Organization has stated that infectious diseases are spreading faster than ever before and that it has become more difficult to treat them
 apni vaarshik vishwa swasthya report 2008 main raashtra sangh agency ne kaha he ki 1970 ke dashak se har saal ek yaa zyada nae rogon kaa pataa chal rahaa he, jo abhootpurv he
 The agency has said that efforts to control well-known diseases such as tuberculosis are also getting limited, as they are developing into more potent and resistant varieties of medicines
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne kaha he ki sankramak rogon ke prasar kaa kaaran pichley 50 varshon main antarrashtriya hawaii yatayaat main vruddhi he
 It has confirmed the spread of over 1,100 different diseases in the last 5 years alone
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne apane 193 sadasyon ko bimariyon ke failane ke bare main jaankaree dene or tike viksit karne main madad dene ke liye vishaanuon ke namoonon kaa aadan-pradaan karne main ek-duusare ke saath zyada sahyog karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Premature combating of diseases through vaccines and keeping them under control is a commendable progress achieved by humans in treating diseases
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan dwaara prakashit ek report ke anusaar abhi bhi vishwa main har saal lakhon bachche sankramak rogon ke shikaar ho rahe hai, lekin un main se bees lakh ko tikon ke jariye bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 We should first know what vaccine is

 In the year 1796, a British doctor was successful in treating smallpox by introducing a disease like cow pox in the human body such as the chicken pox
 is tarah maanav ne chechak ke tike kaa avishkaar kiya
 In 1980, the World Medical Organization announced the end of smallpox, which was the first disease to be eradicated through immunity
 us ke baad maanav ne lambe arase ke prayaason se anek rogon, jaise chechak, plig, kaali khaansee, rohinee, hanustambh, khasre or pagal kute ke rog ke tikon kaa utpaadan karne kii kshamta hasil kii
 Vaccination is given great importance in different countries because of the special role of vaccines in combating infectious diseases
 china main bhi yah kaary bahut pehle shuru ho gaya tha
 Vaccination is being given more and more importance in China, making rapid social and economic development and the work of vaccinating children has special importance
 china main rog pratirakshan kshamta badhaane kaa kaam yojananusaar kiya jaataa he
 In China, all children under seven years of age are vaccinated against diseases like polio, measles, jaundice, tuberculosis, whooping cough and Rohini
 iskaa mukhya kharch sarkaar uthaati he
 Children's parents spend very little on this
 1970 ke dashak se china main yah kaam shuru hone ke baad se baari pragati hui he
 Due to this, the immunization capacity of Chinese children was greatly improved
 chini ballrog visheshgy doctor hu yamei ke anusaar varsh 2003 main jab china sars se grast hua, tab bhi china main koi bhi baccha is rog kaa shikaar nahin bana
 Experts believe that the measles vaccine given to Chinese children gave them the power to combat SARS
 isiilie bahut kam chini bachche 2003 main sars ke shikaar hue
 No child died due to SARS
 pataa chalaa he ki 15 saal pehle hi china ne apane 15 pratishat bacchon ko tikaa lagane kaa lakshya puraa kar liya tha
 The United Nations Children's Fund, the World Medical Organization and the Chinese Ministry of Health jointly investigated this work and gave it a high evaluation
 tikon se china main khasre aadi sankramak rogon main bahut kami ai he
 For example, in the 1960s, the death rate from this fell from 2000 per lakh to 10
 china varsh 1960 main chechak kaa khaatmaa kar chukaa tha or varsh 2000 main usne polio kaa naash karne ke yuddh main vijay pai
 In addition to the five essential vaccines prescribed by the Chinese government, the Chinese people also have the facility to get their children vaccinated in hospitals for flu and jaundice, at their own expense
 bacchon ke alaava praudh log bhi vibhinn mausamon main utpann hone vaale sankramak rogon kii rokthaam ke liye aspataal main aavashyak tike lagava sakate hai
 It is also discussed here that dogs in China are more than enough, so people need to be vaccinated against the disease of mad dogs
 naye sankramak rogon kaa muqabla karne ke liye ab chini visheshgy naye tikon kaa anusandhan kar rahe hai
 Dr
 Ho Shung, expert of the Chinese Disease Prevention Society, says that Chinese experts are engaged in the invention of many new vaccines
 tikon ke jariye aids, cancer or kuch puraane gambhir rogon kaa muqabla karne kii bhi badi sambhaavna he
 Therefore, efforts being made in this context will not be meaningless

 It has seen three great narratives and some of the most heroic works of valor still sung by local singers
 chittod ke durg ko 2013 main unesco vishwa viraasat sthal ghoshit kiya gaya
 According to historians, this fort was built by the Mauryan dynasty king Chitrangad Maurya in the seventh century and built it in the name of Chitrakuta
 mewar ke pracheen sikkon par ek taraf chitrakoot naam ankit miltaa he
 Later it came to be called Chittor
 san 738 raja bappa rawal ne raajaputaane par rajya karne vaale mauryvansh ke antim shaasha manmori ko haraakar yah kila apane adhikaar main kar liya
 Then the Paramara king Munj of Malwa snatched it from the Guhilvans and merged it with his kingdom
 is prakaar 9 veen -10 veen shatabdi main is par parmaron kaa aadhipaty rahaa
 In 1133, Solanki king Jai Singh of Gujarat defeated Yashovarman and took away Malwa from the Paramaras, due to which the fort of Chittorgarh also came under the authority of the Solankis
 tadnantar jaisingh ke uttaradhikari kumarpal ke bhattije ajaypal ko parrast kar mewar ke raja samant singh ne san 1174 ke aasapaas punah guhilavanshiyon kaa aadhipaty sthapit kar diya
 After the fall of Nagda from 1213 to 1252, Jaitra Singh ruled here making it the capital
 san 1303 main yahan ke rawal ratnasingh kii alaudin khilji se ladaai hui
 The battle became famous as the first Shaka of Chittor
 is ladaai main allaudin khilji kii vijay hui or usne apane putr khijr khan ko yah rajya saunp diya khijr khan ne vaapasi par chittod kaa rajkaaj kanhadev ke bhai maldev ko saunp diya
 It is a little difficult to say for sure about time
 ek kinvadanmat ke anusaar pandavon ke duusare bhai bhim ne ise kareeb 5000 varsh purv banwaaya tha
 The prevailing story in this regard is that once Bhima goes out in search of property, he meets a yogi Nirbhayanath and a Yeti Kukadeswar on the way
 bhim ne yogi se paras pathar maanga, jise yogi is shart par dene ko raji hua ki vah is pahari sthaan par raaton-raat ek durg kaa nirmaan karvaa de
 Bhima had almost finished this task with the help of his Shaurya and Devarup brothers, with only a little work remaining in the southern part
 yogi ke ruday main kapat ne sthaan le liya or usne yeti se murge kii aawaaj main bang dene ko kaha, jisase bhim savera samajhakar nirmaan kaary band kar de or use paras pathar nahin dena pade
 Bhima got angry on hearing the hen's bang and he gave a kick to the ground with anger, which made a big pit there, which people also know as the addiction pool
 vah sthaan jahaan bhim ke ghutane ne vishram kiya, bhim-ghodi kehalaata he
 The pond on which Yeti tied the rooster is called Kukdeshwar

 With his efforts, the glory of Chittor was restored
 or road rajya dwaara stapit kiya san 1538 main chittod par gujarat ke bahadurshah ne akraman kar diya
 This war is known as the Second Shaka of Mewar
 san 1567 main mewar kaa teesraa shaakaa hua, jisamen akbar ne chittod par chadhaai kar di thi
 All this Muslim invasion is one of the main reasons for the cultural destruction of Chittorgarh
 tisare shaake ke baad hi san 1559 main maharana udaisingh ne mewar kii rajdhani chittod se hataakar aravali ke madhya pichhola jhil ke paas sthapit kar di, jo aaj udaipur ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The fort of Chittorgarh always has a special significance in Rajputana
 ise mewar ke guhilavanshiyon kii pehali rajdhani ke rup main sammaan praapt he, jise unhone mauryvansh ke antim shaasha manmoni ko haraakar apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 This fort is built in length from north to south on the hill of Aravali, in which a tank, pond, temple, palace etc
 have all been built from time to time under a definite construction plan due to the level land in the middle
 kuch jalashay to aise hai jo nirantar jalaapurti ke saadhan ke rup main kaam aate rahe hai
 There is a saying prevalent in relation to this fort, which explains the importance of this fort
 vastav main is durg kaa nirmaan abhi bhi hamen vismay va romaanch se bhar detaa he
 But from a strategic point of view it shows that due to its geographical reasons it was not suitable for fortification like fortifications like Ranthambore and Kubhalgarh
 ni:andeh kila sudrudh tha
 On the edge of the hill was a row of rocks standing on top of which a high and strong type was built
 saath hi saath durg main pravesh karne ke liye lagaataar saat daravaaje kuch interval par banaae gayi the
 For all these reasons, it was very difficult for the enemies to enter the fort
 parantu yah vistrut maidan ke bich ek lambi pahari par bana he jo anya parvat shreniyon se pruthak ho gaya he
 Therefore, it was easily prevented by the enemies by encircling it and transporting the logistics used in the fort
 is durg kaa jab-jab gheraa daalaa gaya tab-tab garh main bhojan-saamagree vidyaman rahane tak hi garh surakshit rahaa
 The Rajputs were forced to open the fort's gate for war as soon as the food items were exhausted
 lekin praayah shatruon kii badi sena hone kii sthiti main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 Thus we see that the selection of Chittorgarh as the capital was not justified from the point of view of strategy and it was for this reason that Maharana Udai Singh made Udaipur his capital, which was much safer due to being surrounded by mountains all around

 About a quarter of a mile away comes the river Gambhiri, on which Alauddin Khilji's Shahzade Khizr Khan has a strong stone bridge built in 1303
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yah pul rana hammir singh jo rana lakshmana singh ke putr arisingh ne, jo allaudin ke saath ladaai main maaraa gaya tha, ne banwaaya tha, lekin zyaadaatar vidwaan isse sahamat nahin hai, kyonki is pul ke nirmaan main kai hindu or jain mandiron ko giraakar uske pattharon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Also its construction style is also Muslim

 The sixth façade is semicircular from the west bank of the river

 There is a district court in the town, from which the ascent of the fort begins
 durg ke antim pravesh tak kul saat daravaaje banaaye gayi hai
 There are several buildings from the entry way to the inner campus, which are briefly mentioned as follows- yah durg kaa pratham pravesh dwaar he
 It is said that once a river of blood flowed in a fierce war, a scramble came here
 isi kaaran is dwaar ko paden pole kaha jaataa he
 When Chitrakoot became subjugated, the valiant warrior Gadiloharo took a pledge till Chitrakoot became independent till then: - 1
 is durg par nahin chadhege 2
 Will not stay home 3
pine ke liye pani kaa rassa nahin rakhenge , Will eat it in the clay pot

 One night during the battle of this third month, when Jamal was repairing a broken wall, at that time one of his legs became useless with Akbar's bullet

 Because there is a temple of Lord Hanuman nearby

 This is the fifth gate of the fort and it is called Jodala Pol because it is near the sixth gate
 durg ke is chathe dwaar ke paas hi ek chota sa lakshmana ji kaa mandir he jiske kaaran iskaa naam lakshmana pole he
 Proceeding from Laxman Pol, a west facing entrance is found, through which one can enter the fort

 zahir ud-din mohammad babar jo babar ke naam se prasiddh hua, ek mughal shaasha tha, jinka mul madhya asia tha
 He was the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India
 wo taimur langs ke parpote tha, or vishwaas rakhte tha ki changez khan unke vansh ke purvaj tha
 Babur is believed to be the creator of the verse style called Mubaiyan
 babar kaa janm fargana ghati ke andithan naamak shahar main hua tha jo ab uzbekistan main he
 He was the eldest son of his father Omar Sheikh Mirza, the ruler of the Fargana Valley, whom he described as a man of a stout body, muscular face and round beard, and mother Kutlugh Nigar Khanam
 haalaanki babar kaa mul mongolia ke berlas kabeeley se sambandhit tha par us kabeeley ke logon par farsi tathaa turk janajivan kaa bahut asar rahaa tha, ve islam main parivartit hue tathaa unhone turkestan ko apana vasasthaan banaaya
 Babur's mother tongue was Chagtai language, but he was also proficient in Persian, which was the common language of the place at that time
 usne chagatai main babarnama ke naam se apni jeevani likhi
 Despite being of Mongol caste, his people and followers were Turks and Persians
 uski sena main turk, farsi, pashto ke alaava berlas tathaa madhya asian kabeeley ke log bhi the
 It is said that Babur was very strong and powerful
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki sirf vyaayaam ke liye wo do logon ko apane dono kandhon par ladakar unnayan dhaal par daud letaa tha
 According to folklore, Babur swam across all the rivers that came in his way
 usne ganga ko do baar tair kar paar kiya
 Babur's cousin Mirza Muhammad Haider wrote that at that time, when the Chagatai people were rude and un-cultured, they found it difficult to pronounce Zahir-ud-din Muhammad
 is kaaran unhone iskaa naam babar rakh diya
 When he became the Mughal ruler of India, he named his full name Zahiruddin Mohammad Babur
 babar mughal kaal kaa mahaan shaasha tha
 In 1494, at the age of 12, he was appointed as the ruler of the Fargana Valley
 uske chaachaaon ne is sthiti kaa faaydaa uthaaya or babar ko gaddi se hataa diya
 For many years he spent his life in exile when he was accompanied by some peasants and his relatives
 1496 main usne uzbek shahar samarkand par akraman kiya or 7 maheenon ke baad use jeet bhi liya
 Meanwhile, when he was attacking Samarkand, one of his military leaders captured Fargana
 jab babar isapar waapas adhikaar karne fargana aa rahaa tha to uski sena ne samarkand main uskaa saath chhod diya jiske falswaroop samarkand or fargana donon uske haathon se chale gaye
 In 1501, he regained Samarkand, but was soon defeated by Uzbek Khan Muhammad Shaibani, and thus Samarkand, which was the great wish of his life, withdrew from his hands
 fargana se apane chand vafaadaar sainikon ke saath bhaagane ke baad agle teen saalon tak usne apni sena banane par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 In this order he recruited a large number of Tajik provinces in his army
 san 1504 main hindookush kii barfili chotiyon ko paar karke usne kabul par apana niyantran sthapit kiya
 With the advent of the new empire, he dreamed of opening the stars of his destiny
 kuch dinon ke baad usne heraat ke ek taimurvanshi hossain baikarah, jo ki uskaa dur kaa rishtedaar bhi tha, ke saath mohammad shaibani ke viruddh sahyog kii sandhi kii
 But this did not happen due to Hussain's death in 1506 and he established his control over Herat
 par do maheenon ke bheetar hi, sadhano ke abhaav main use heraat chhodana padaa
 In his biography he describes Herat as "a city full of intellectuals"
 vahaan par use yuigur kavi mir ali shah navai kii rachanaaon ke bare main pataa chalaa jo chaagatai bhashaa ko sahitya kii bhashaa banane ke paksh main the
 Perhaps Babar would have got inspiration to write his biography in Chagatai language
 kabul lautne ke do saal ke bheetar hi ek or sargana ne uske kilaaf vidroh kiya or use kabul se bhaagna padaa
 Soon he regained control of Kabul
 idhar san 1510 main faras ke shah ismail pratham, jo safivi vansh kaa shaasha tha, ne mohammad shaibani ko haraakar uski hatya kar daali
 Seeing this situation, Babur re-established control over Herat
 iske baad usne shah ismail pratham ke saath madhya asia par milakar adhipaty jamaane ke liye ek samjhauta kiya
 In return for Shah Ismail's help, he accepted the superiority of the Safavis and considered himself and his followers under the sovereignty of the Safavis
 iske uttar main shah ismail ne babar ko uski bahan khanazada se milaayaa jise shaibani, jise shah ismail ne haal hi main haraa kar maar daalaa tha, ne kaid main rakhaa hua tha or usase vivaah karne kii balaat koshish kar rahaa tha
 The Shah gave full support to Babur for ash-o-aram and military interests, which Babar himself adapted to the Shia tradition
 usne shiya musalamaanon ke anuroop vastra pahananaa aarambh kiya
 During the reign of Shah Isma'il, Persia became a stronghold of Shia Muslims and considered himself a descendant of the seventh Shia Imam Musa al-qazim
 vahaan sikke shah ke naam main dhalate the tathaa maszid main khutabe shah ke naam se padhe jate the haalaanki kabul main sikke or khutabe babar ke naam se hi the
 Babur Samarkand ruled as an associate of Shah Ismail
 shah kii madad se babar ne bukhaara par chadhaai kii
 Babur, being a Timurvanshi, was seen by the people as a savior of the Uzbek and the villagers in the village vacated to congratulate him
 iske baad faras ke shah kii madad ko anaavashyak samajhakar usne shah kii sahaayta leni band kar di
 In October 1511 he marched on Samarkand and once again subjugated it
 vahaan bhi uskaa swaagat hua or ek baar phir gaanv ke gaanv usko badhai dene ke liye khaali ho gaye
 There he looked completely different in Shia clothes among Sunni Muslims
 haalaanki uskaa shiya huliya sirf shah ismail ke prati samyata ko darshane ke liye thi, usne apana shiya swaroop banaae rakhaa
 Although he did not massacre the Sunnis to appease the Shah of Persia, he did not give up his faith in the Shia, which caused widespread disbelief in the public
 iske falswaroop, 8 maheenon ke baad, uzbekon ne samarkand par phir se adhikaar kar liya
 After the fall of the Khilji dynasty on the Delhi Sultanate, there was a state of anarchy
 temurlang ke akraman ke baad saiyyadon ne sthiti kaa faaydaa uthaakar dilli kii satta par adhipaty kaayam kar liya
 This dynasty was founded by Khizr Khan after Timur Lang was made the ruler of Punjab
 baad main lodi rajvansh ke afagaanon ne saiyyadon ko haraa kar satta hathiyaa lee thi
 Babur felt that the Sultanate of Delhi should be ruled by the Timurvans again
 ek taimurvanshi hone ke kaaran wo dilli sultanate par kabza karnaa chahta tha
 He made Sultan Ibrahim Lodi aware of his wish
 ibrahim lodi ke jabaab nahin aane par usne chote-chote akraman karne aarambh kar die
 First he captured Kandahar
 idhar shah ismail ko turkon ke haathon baari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After this war, both Shah Ismail and Babur realized the military importance of landmines and started using it in their army
 iske baad usne ibrahim lodi par akraman kiya
 This battle fought in Panipat is known as the First Battle of Panipat
 yah yuddh babarnama ke anusaar 21 april 1526 ko ladaa gaya tha
 Babur's army in this was very small in front of Ibrahim Lodi's army
 par sena main sanghathan ke abhaav main ibrahim lodi yah yuddh babar se haar gaya
 After this Babur came to power in Delhi and laid the foundation of Mughal dynasty in 1526
 rana sanga ke netritv main rajput kaaphi sangathit tathaa shaktishaalee ho chuke the
 The Rajputs had liberated a large area and wanted to seize power in Delhi
 babar kii sena rajputon kii aadhi bhi nahin thi
 On 17 March 1527, the Battle of Khanwa was fought between the Rajputs and Babur's army
 rajputon kaa jeetna nishchit lag rahaa tha
 But during the war, the Tomars left Rana Sanga and joined Babur
 iske baad rana sanga ghayal avasthaa me unke saathiyo ne yuddh se baahar kar diya or ek aasaan-si lag rahi jeet uske haathon se nikal gai
 a year later, Rana Sanga died due to poisoning by a minister on 30 January 1528 and Babur's greatest fear was averted from his forehead
 iske baad babar dilli kii gaddi kaa avivaadit adhikari ban gaya
 In the coming days, the Mughal dynasty ruled the power of India for 300 years
 babar ke dwaara mughalavansh kii neenv rakhane ke baad mughalon ne bharat kii samskruti par apana amit chhap chodi
 The Battle of Khanwa was fought on 17 March 1527 between Rana Sanga, the ruler of Mewar and Babur
 is main ibrahim lodi ke bhai mehmood lodi ne rana kaa saath diya diya tha isamen rana sanga kii haar hui thi or babar kii vijay hui thi
 This is why Babar decided to stay in India, for the first time in this war, Babur gave the slogan of Dharma war Jihad, after this war Babur took the title of Ghazi i

 The ruler of Calicut and even the kings of Burma, ruling in Pegu and Tanasserim, offered him gifts
 yah jaankaree nunise ke lekhan se praapt hui thi
 The Persian Ambassador Abdul Razzaq, who visited southern India in 1443, wrote that in total Dev Raya II extended the Vijayanagara Empire from Orissa to Malabar and Ceylon to Gulbarg, as well as captured several ports of South India
 iske baad bhi bahamani samrajya ke saath muddon ko abhi tak suljhaayaa nahin ja sakaa tha or dev raaya dwitiya ke puure shasankaal ke dauraan ye donon samrajya ek duusare ke shatru hi bane rahe

 1443 main kalikat kii yatra ke dauraan unke bhai dwaara unki hatya kaa prayaas kiya gaya jo vifal ho gaya
 The king was injured and it appears that Sultan Alauddin must have been aware of this conspiracy as he immediately took advantage of this opportunity and demanded a big offering to Dev Raya II
 Dev Raya refused to give and marched on Raichur, Bankapur and Bijapur
 When it seemed that the victory of Dev Raya was difficult, the Sultan's forces pushed the forces of Vijayanagar into the fort of Mudgal and Dev Raya had to pay to establish peace

 vidhik pratyakshvaad vidhi evam vidhishastra ke darshan se sambandhit ek vichaardhaara he
 It was developed mostly by the thinkers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, among whom Jeremy Bentham and John Austin are prominent
 kintu vidhik pratyakshvaad ke itihaas main sabase ullekhneey naam ech el e heart kaa he jinaki 'da cocept of lau' naamak pustak ne is vishay main gaharaai se vichaar karne ko majaboor kar diya
 In recent years, Ronald Dorkin has raised serious questions on some central ideas of legal positivism
 vidhik pratyakshvaad ko saar rup main kahana kathin he kintu praayah mana jaataa he ki vidhik pratyakshvaad kaa kendriya vichaar yah he: Analytical thinking was mainly initiated by Bentham towards the end of the eighteenth century, which was later developed by Austin
 ise pramanvadi vichaardhaara bhi kaha jaataa he
 Samand calls it systematic jurisprudence and CK Allen normative doctrine
 is vichaardhaara kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki jis prakaar bhautik-vigyaan vishleshan ke bal par aage badhata he thik usee prakaar yah kisi cheez ko bina vishleshan ke yathaavat sweekaar nahin kar leti
 Like the natural ideology, it does not consider the method to be divine or divine or received, rather it originates from the sovereign state
 yah vichaardhaara vidhik niyamon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Therefore, it is different from historical or sociological ideology
 yah vichaardhaara naagarik vidhi tathaa anya vidhiyon ke parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan vishleshnatmak dhang se karnaa chaahati he tathaa vidhi ko praapt nahin apitu nirmit maanati he
 This ideology has no meaning in what is the origin of the method's historical progress
 julius stone ne thik hi kaha he ‘‘isaki pramukh dilchaspee vidhik bhavarthon ke vishleshan or vidhik tark vaakyon ke taarkik antah sambandhon ke bare main khojbin karnaa he
 Samand has expressed the purpose of this ideology in these words- munro smith ke anusaar yah vichaardhaara rajya kii sachetan muhar vidhi ke liye aavashyak maanati he
 In this sense method is the expression of conscious and fixed human desire
 pramanwad ek vaigyanik drushtikon pradaan karata he jisase anubhav se pare pariklpanaaon ko asweekaar kar aankadon dwaara prastut anubhav tak hi simit rahaa ja sake
 This approach is limited to the analysis of the given facts and does not go away from the phenomena of cognition
 ateet tathaa bhavishya kii pariklpanaaon se dur rahakar ‘vidhi jaisi he’ ke tathyaatmak adhyayan ke kaaran ise pramanvadi drushtikon naam diya gaya he
 Being mainly prevalent in England and associated with Austin, it is also called English or Austenian school
 ise vidhi ko samprabhu kaa samadesh maanane or use maane jane kii baadhyataa ke kaaran aagyaatmak siddhanth bhi kaha jaataa he
 Hart considers it to be "the command, discipline and the Triveni of Samprabhu"
 is vichaardhaara main manushya dwaara vidhi ke nirmaanatmak tatwon par vishesh bal diya jaataa he
 At the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, this ideology was born for the following reasons
 1
 atharahavin shatabdi prakritik vidhi vichaarkon kii thi jisamen vidhik darshan par niti, vivek tathaa nyaay ke siddhanth haaavee the
 This was the era of 'method as it should be'
 parantu yah bahut samay tak sangat nahin rahaa
 Bentham distanced himself from this type of ideology and emphasized on explanatory jurisprudence i
e
 'law which is'
 taatpary he ki vishleshnatmak vichaardhaara kaa janm prakritik vidhi vichaardhaara ke virodh swaroop hua
 2
 The progress made in physics in the early nineteenth century certainly had an impact on the principles of legal science as well
 vidhi ke adhyayan ke liye sakshya, tark, pareekshan tathaa die gayi tathyon ke vishleshan ke tareekon ko apanaaya gaya
 Scientific, systematic empirical or empirical method was adopted to study the method
 3
 aisa prathit hota he ki vishleshanvaadi vichaardhaara ke dwaara england main saamanton tathaa pope aadi par samprabhu shaasha kii shreshthata siddh kii gai
 With this ideology, spiritual interference in the field of law decreased
 vidhik pramanwad ko rajya samprabhu ke rup main tathaa vidhi ko samprabhu ke samadesh ke rup main or vidhi ke anupaalan main anushaasti ke tatv kii vyakhya ke kaaran vidhi kaa aagyaatmak siddhanth bhi kaha gaya he
 Legalism has been used in various ways
 aadhunik vishleshnatmak pramanvadi vichaarak pro echele heart ne swayan iskaa prayog paanch arthon main sweekaar kiya he
 In explaining the actual background of the experiment conducted in these five sense, Hart makes it clear that the principles from Bentham and Austin follow but do not follow the other principles
 isi tarah kelson ne, or main vyakt siddhanton ko mana he parantu or main diye gayi siddhanton ko nahin
 According to Hart, none of the theories described in Bentham, Austin, and Kelsen have been accepted
 phir bhi yah siddhanth pratyakshtah bina paryaapt kaarnon ke vishleshnatmak vidhishastriyon ke saath aksar jod diya jaataa he

 Along with food and life, the problem of heating has also entangled the brain of humans since the heating and ventilation ages
 sheet pradeshon main to iskaa mahatv he hi, anek ushn pradeshon main bhi sheetkaal main taapan anivaary ho jaataa he
 But like food, man did not have to look outside, because this body itself is the source of heat and if the necessary measures are taken to preserve the heat emanating from the body then the heating problem of man is solved

 This heat loss is prevented by some clothes

 As a result, the body suffers, its temperature rises and disturbances occur
 yadi kapade bahut kam pahane jaaen to jitani ooshmaa utpann hoti he, usase adhik kii honi hoti he, falat: sharir thandha hota jaataa he or ksht hota he
 In fact, in any case, the human body is not required to provide external heat, but in many circumstances it is necessary to keep only those rooms which are the habitat of the human, so that the loss of physical heat is as much as the body produces

 In many methods of heating, four processes are followed by each other
 pehali he urjavimochan, jo pray: bhatthi, agnidhan yaa boyler main hota he
 At the time of fuel burning, the chemical energy contained in it is freed and converted into heat, by which any effluent, such as air, steam or water is heated
 duusari prakriya main, ooshmaa liye hue pravaahee padaarth chalakar us sthaan par pahunchataa he, jahaan ooshmaa mukt hoti he
 In the third process, the heat is released from the flow material and reaches the outer floor of the room air or an appliance, such as heat radiator or thermoacoustic etc
 chauthi prakriya ooshmaa vitaran kii hoti he, jisase vah reeti se kamare main sab jagah fail jaae
 Central heating is the production of heat at a central location, in large buildings, or in many buildings, to all places as needed

 In heat-air heating, heat reaches the designated place by convection

 Although it is not an efficacious effect such as heating, or evaporation, it is a good method to cool the room coldly
 Some hot air conditioning plants can also provide cold air in summer

 The practical form of vapor heating was discovered by James Watt in 1784 AD

 Boilers, taps and radiators are the main parts of this method
 nal vyavastha, vikirak or mazdooree aadi kii laagat adhik hone se yah paddati ushn vaayu paddati kii apeksha mahangi padati he, kintu usase adhik vishwasaneey bhi he
 By placing the radiator at the places where the heat is highest, the heat distribution is relatively similar with this method

 This low temperature is not pleasant
 yadi farsh ke paas kaa taap badhaane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he to upar kii ore cameraa itnaa garm ho jaataa he ki sukh nahin miltaa
 To avoid such heat, radiation heat is resorted to
 kamare kii kisi diwaar main vikirak na lagaakar jal ke nalon kii kundali yaa nal paryaapt lambaai main farsh main hi dabaa die jate hai
 Hot water flows inside them causes the floor to heat up and radiate heat
 vikiran ooshman se ooshmaa bich kii vaayu kii vishesh garm karke sidhe vyakti ke sharir par padati hai, jo adhik priy hota he or kamare ke bheetar tapantar adhik nahin hota
 a similar effect can be produced by blowing warm air into the drains inside the floor
 garm jal yaa garam vaayu ke nal farsh ke bajaay deevaaron yaa chhaton main bhi lagaae jate hai
 This system is similar to the Hipocast built by the Romans for central heating in ancient times
 iske liye vishesh vikirak kamare main upyukt sthaan yaa sthanon par rakh die jate hai
 There are some radiations in which gas burns and a fan keeps circulating hot air
 kuch main dhaatu hi gas se garm ho jaati he or ooshmaa vikirit karti he
 There are also some in which the water becomes steam after heating and heat is radiated from the coil of the steam filled tubes
 bijli kaa heater bhi vikirak he, jo bahudhaa upyog main aata he
 In this, the wire coil of the electrostatic is heated by the electric power and the heat is radiated

 Therefore, radiated heat is obtained from them in very large quantities

 haan, inamen yah dosha avashya he ki nikatavarti sthaan adhik garm ho jaataa he, jabaki usee kamare main doorvarti sheethal hi bana rahata he
 Coal, coke, oil or gas are often used as fuel for heat generation

 Electricity is often used for local heating, where some space has to be heated quickly
 sanyukt rajya america main, jahaan prakritik gas milti he, vahaan se vah nalon dwaara saikadon mile dur tak le jaai jaati he or taapan tathaa udyog ke kaam aati he
 Where there are more hot water fountains, the hot water is transported far away by unburned tubes
 iceland main soton kaa garam pani 40 mile dur tak taapan ke kaam aata he
 Taking dirty air from a place and transporting clean air there is called ventilation
 sanvathan sambandhi vichaaron main sthaan sthaan par bahut vividhta pai jaati he
 In any country, the entry of open air, even if the temperature drops, is considered essential for health and happiness
 On the contrary, special care is taken in Germany that the air should not pass through the room in winter
 phir bhi vahaan iskaa koi dushprabhav drushtigochar nahin hota
 During World War II, the experience gained from the anti-gas chambers is that the area of the floor on which the heat wall radiated from the body is the test of comfort, not the fraction of carbon dioxide mixed in the air
 prakritik sanvathan bheetar or baahar ke taap ke antar tathaa vaayu kii disha or gati ke adheen he

 In such a situation, artificial ventilation is managed completely by not relying on natural ventilation
