 tendoodhaar, sanrgarh mandal main bharat ke chhattisgarh rajya ke antargat raigarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The term Vakataka is used to refer to a dynasty of ancient India that ruled from the middle of the third century to the sixth century
 us vansh ko is naam se kyon sambandhit kiya gaya, is prashn kaa sahi uttar dena kathin he
 There has been some place in Central India named Syatma Vakat, where the ruling dynasty called Vakataka
 atev pratham raja ko ajanta lekh main "vaakatak vanshaketu:" kaha gaya he
 The rule of this dynasty was elaborated on the greater terrain of Madhya Pradesh and ancient Berar, whose first ruler Vindhyashakti gets its name in Vayu Purana and Ajantlekh
 sambhavat: vindhyas parvatiy bhaag par shashan karne ke kaaran pratham raja 'vindhyashakti' kii padavi se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 It is difficult to present the authentic chronicle of this king, because no record or coin of Vindhyashakti was available yet
 teesri sadi ke madhya main satvaahan rajya kii avnati ho jane se vindhyashakti ko avasar mil gaya to bhi uskaa yash sthaayee na rah sakaa
 His son i Pravarsen immortalized the dynasty's reputation
 abhilekhon ke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki pratham pravarasen ne dakshin main rajyavistaar ke upalaksh main chaar ashwamedh kiye or samrat kii padavi dhaaran kii
 In the absence of a powerful king contemporary to Pravarsen, the Vakataka kingdom expanded into Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Bharat
 baghelkhand ke adhinsth shaasha vyaghraraj kaa ullekh samudragupta ke stambhalekh main bhi aayaa he
 Probably, Pravarsen had captured East India, Malwa, Gujarat, Kathiawad in the first phase of the fourth century but there is no strong evidence to confirm this
 yah to nishchit he ki pravarasen kaa prabhaav dakshin main tak fail gaya tha
 But on what part he continued to rule directly, it is not clear
 yah kahana sarvatha uchit hoga ki vaakatak rajya ko samrajya ke rup main parinat karnaa usee kaa kaary tha
 The first pravarasena has confirmed this with Vedic yajnas
 chauthi sadi ke madhya main uskaa pautra pratham rudrasen rajya kaa uttaradhikari hua, kyonki pravarasen kaa jyeshtha putr gotmiputra pehle hi mar chukaa tha
 The history of Maharaja Rudrasen I, the third ruler of the Vakataka dynasty, is considered very controversial
 prarambh main vah aapattiyon tathaa nirbalata ke kaaran apni sthiti ko sabal na bana sakaa
 Some scholars believe that his ancestral kingdom wanted to divide and rule, but no account is attainable except for the patriarchal service
 vaakatak rajya ke dakshin-pashchim bhaag main sarvasen ne apana prabhutv sthapit kar liya tha jahaan uske vanshaj paanchavi sadi tak rajya karte rahe
 In this context, it is reasonable to assume that his maternal grandfather Bharasiva Maharaj Bhavnag helped Rudrasen i in the asymmetrical situation, as a result of which Rudrasen could consolidate his power
 is vaakatak raja ke vinaash ke sambandh main kuch logon kii asaty dhaaran bani hui he ki guptavansh ke utthan se rudrasen pratham nasht ho gaya
 The Gupta emperor Samudragupta killed the Vakataka king Rudrasen i in the battle of Kaushambi
 His son Prithivishan i conquered Kuntal and strengthened the Vakataka dynasty in South India
 uske mahatvapurn sthaan ke kaaran hi gupt samrat dwitiya chandragupta ko apni putree kaa vivaah yuvaraj rudrasen se karnaa padaa tha
 Due to this marital relationship, the Gupta influence became excessive in South India
 falat: dwitiya rudrasen ne singhasanarudh hone par apane shvasur kaa kathiyawad vijay ke abhiyaan main saath diya tha
 Due to the premature death of the second Rudrasen, his wife Prabhavati Gupta began to rule as a guardian of unsupervised sons
 vaakatak shashan kaa shubhachintak banakar dwitiya chandragupta ne sakriy sahyog bhi diya
 Cooperative employees were appointed from Pataliputra
 yahi kaaran tha ki prabhavati gupta ke punatamrapatr main guptavanshavali hi ullikhit hui he
 Later on, the crown prince Damodarsen II ascended the throne in the name of Pravarsen, but the articles of this dynasty state that no battle campaign could take place from Pravarsen till the Second Earth
 paanchavi sadi ke ant main rajasatta venimshakha ke shaasha harishen ke haath main gai, jise ajanta lekh main kuntal, avanti, laat, koshal, kaling tathaa andhra deshon kaa vijeta kaha gaya he use uttaradhikariyon kii nirbalata ke kaaran vaakatak vansh vinasht ho gaya
 It is known from the study of records that the state of Vakataka in South India has been magnificent, strong and proud
 saanskrithik utthan main bhi is vansh ne haath bataya tha
 In the Prakrit poems "setubandh" and "harivijay Kavya" are considered as the works of Pravarsena II and Sarvasen respectively
 vaise praakrit kavy tathaa subhashit ko "vaidarbhi style" kaa naam diya gaya he
 Vakataknaresh was a follower of Vedic religion, hence the description of many yagyas are found in the articles
 kala ke kshetra main bhi iskaa kaary prashansaneey rahaa he
 Ajanta's painting received greater impetus in the Vakataka era, which is considered to be a unique mural in the world
 naachna kaa mandir bhi isi yug main nirmit hua or usee vaastukala kaa anukaran kar udaygiri, devgarh evam ajanta main guhanirmaan hua tha
 The practice of all subjects shows that the Vakataka king showed special affection in cultural upliftment than in the state
 yahi is vash kii visheshta he

 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis

 According to the will of the Guru, Ramanuja was pledged to do three special works - writing the commentary of Brahmasutra, Vishnu Sahasranama and Divya Prabandham
 unhone grihasth ashram tyaag kar shrirangam ke yatiraj naamak sanyasi se sanyas kii diksha lee
 Ramanuja moved from Srirangam in Mysore to a place called Shaligram
 ramanuj ne us kshetra main baarah varsh tak vaishnav dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 After that he traveled all over India for the promotion of Vaishnavism
 1137 isvi san main 120 varsh kii aayu paakar ve brahmaleen hue
 Although he composed many books, but his two original books written on the commentary of Brahmasutra became the most popular - Shribhayasam and Vedanta Sangram
 ramanujacharya ke darshan main satta yaa paramsat ke sambandh main teen str maane gayi hai - brahm arthath ishwar, chit arthath aatm tatv or achit arthath prakruti tatv
 In fact, this mind is not separate from Brahman or God, ie Atman and Atitva, which is the nature of Brahma or God, but they are uniquely two forms of Brahma and are based on Brahma or God
 vastut: yahi ramanujacharya kaa vishishtadvait kaa siddhanth he
 Just as the body and soul are not separate and the body works for the fulfillment of the purpose of self, similarly there is no existence of mind and immaterial element apart from Brahma or God
 ve brahm yaa ishwar kaa sharir hai tathaa brahm yaa ishwar unki aatma sadrishy hai
 According to Ramanuja, devotion does not mean worship or kirtan-bhajan but to meditate or pray to God
 saamaajik pariprekshya se ramanujacharya ne bhakthi ko jati evam varg se pruthak tathaa sabhi ke liye sambhav mana he

 The following page exists in the name of Mission Impossible: samudr manthan ek prasiddh hindu dharmpuranic katha he
 This story comes in the Bhagavata Purana, Mahabharata and Vishnu Purana
 shri shukdev ji bole, "he rajan! raja bali ke rajya main daitya, asur tathaa daanav ati prabal ho uthe the
 He had the power of Shukracharya
 isi bich durvasa rishi ke shaap se devraj indra shaktiheen ho gayi the
 The kingdom of the demon king Bali was on all three worlds
 indra sahit devatagan usase bhaybheet rahete the
 Only Baikunthanath Vishnu could tell the solution of this situation, so all the gods along with Brahma reached Lord Narayana
 unki stuti karke unhone bhagwaan vishnu ko apni vipadaa sunai
 Then God said in sweet voice that this is a time of crisis for you
 daityon, asuron evam daanvon kaa abhyutthan ho rahaa he or tum logon kii avnati ho rahi he
 But the crisis period should be spent in a friendly manner
 tum daityon se mitrataa kar lo or ksheer sagar ko math kar usamen se amrit nikaal kar paan kar lo
 With the help of the demons, this work will be done smoothly
 is kaary ke liye unki har shart maan lo or ant main apana kaam nikaal lo
 By drinking nectar you will become immortal and you will have the ability to kill the demons
 "bhagwaan ke aadeshaanusaar indra ne samudr manthan se amrit nikalne kii baat bali ko bataaya
 The demon king Bali compromised with Devraj Indra and got ready for churning the sea
 mandarachal parvat ko mathni tathaa vasuki naag ko neti banaaya gaya
 The leader emerged from Vasuki's eye
 swayan bhagwaan shri vishnu kacchap avatar lekar mandarachal parvat ko apane peeth par rakhkar uskaa aadhaar ban gayi
 Lord Narayana exerted power demonically in the demons and devoutly in the gods
 vasuki naag ko bhi gahan nidra de kar uske ksht ko har liya
 The god began to hold Vasuki Nag on his face
 is par ulti buddhi vaale daitya, asur, daanavaadi ne sochaa ki vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney main avashya kuch na kuch laabh hoga
 He told the gods that we are not inferior in power to anyone, we will take the place of mouth
 tab devataaon ne vasuki naag ke punch kii ore kaa sthaan le liya
 "the sea churning began and the Mandarachal mountain began to roam on the broad back of the Lord Kachhapa
 he rajan! samudr manthan se sabase pehle jal kaa halaahal vish niklaa
 All the gods and demons started burning with the flame of that poison and their ears began to fade
 is par sabhi ne milakar bhagwaan shankar kii prarthana kii
 On his prayer, Mahadev ji kept the poison on his palm and drank it but did not let it come down from the gorge
 us kalkut vish ke prabhaav se shiv ji kaa kanth nila pad gaya
 That is why Mahadev ji is called Neelkanth
 unki hatheli se thodaa sa vish prithvi par tapak gaya tha jise saanp, bichchhu aadi vifaille jantuon ne grahan kar liya
 "after consuming the poison by Lord Shankar, the ocean churning started again
 doosraa ratna kamdhenu gaay nikali jise rishiyon ne rakh liya
 Then a high horse came out which was kept by Daityaraja Bali
 uske baad airavat hathi niklaa jise devraj indra ne grahan kiya
 After Airavat, Lord Vishnu kept it out of the sea of kaustubhamani
 phir kalpavriksha niklaa or rambha naamak apsara nikali
 These two were kept in heaven
 aage phir samudr ko mathne se lakshmi ji nikaleen
 Laxmi ji got married to Lord Vishnu himself
 uske baad kanya ke rup main vaaruni prakat hai jise daityon ne grahan kiya
 Then after one moon, Parijat tree and conch came out and in the end Dhanvantari Vaidya appeared after taking the nectar
 "dhanvantari ke haath se amrit ko daityon ne chin liya or uske liye aapas main hi ladane lage
 The gods did not have the power to curse Durvasa so that they could fight the demons and take that nectar, so they stood frustrated and watched them fight among themselves
 devataaon kii niraashaa ko dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu tatkaal mohini rup dhaaran kar aapas main ladate daityon ke paas ja pahunche
 Seeing that Vishwamohini form, what is the matter of the demons and the Gods, the Brahmins, the devouring Kamdev himself, Lord Shankar too were fascinated and looked at him again and again
 jab daityon ne us navyauvana sundari ko apni ore aate huye dekha tab ve apana sara jhagada bhul kar usee sundari kii ore kamaskt hokar ekatak dekhne lage
 The monster said, "oh beautiful! Who are you? Looks like we are being sarcastic on us only to settle our dispute
 aao shubhage! tumhaara swaagat he
 Make us beautiful and make this nectar with lotus
 " is par vishwamohini rupi vishnu ne kaha, "he devataaon or daanvon! aap donon hi maharishi kashyap ji ke putr hone ke kaaran bhai-bhai ho phir bhi paraspar ladate ho
 i am an arbitrary woman
 budhimaan log aisi stri par kabhi vishwaas nahin karte, phir tum log kaise mujh par vishwaas kar rahe ho? acha yahi he ki swayan sab mil kar amritpan kar lo
 " vishwamohini ke aise niti kushal vachan sun kar un kamandh daityo, daanvon or asuron ko us par or bhi vishwaas ho gaya
 He said, "beautiful! We have full faith in you
 tum jis prakaar baantogi ham usee prakaar amritpan kar lenge
 Take this event and distribute nectar among all of us
 " vishwamohini ne amrit ghat lekar devataaon or daityon ko alag-alag panktiyo main baithne ke liye kaha
 After that, the demons plastered with their sarcasm and began to make nectar to the gods
 daitya unke kataaksh se aise madahosh huye ki amrit pinaa hi bhul gayi
 God considered this trick as a monster named Rahu
 vah devtaa kaa rup bana kar devataaon main jaakar baith gaya or praapt amrit ko mukh main daal liya
 When the nectar reached its gorge, the moon and the sun called out and said that it is Rahu monster
 yah sunakar bhagwaan vishnu ne tatkaal apane sudarshan chakra se uskaa sir gardan se alag kar diya
 Due to the effect of nectar, his head and torso became two planets named Rahu and Ketu and were established in space
 ve hi bair bhav ke kaaran surya or chandramaa kaa grahan karaate hai
 In this way, Lord Vishnu was omitted from there by giving nectar to the gods
 unke lop hote hi daityon kii madhoshi samaapt ho gai
 They became very angry and started attacking the gods
 bhayankar devasur sangram armbh ho gaya jisamen devraj indra ne daityaraj baali ko parrast kar apana indralok waapas le liya

 There are some special properties of the Samhita Kendra, for example, if a force is applied on an object whose action goes through the Samhita Kendra of that object, then there will be only transfer speed in that object

 In other words, relative to the Samhita-center, the weighted average of the positions of all Samhita is zero

 Code center depends only on the position-vector and mass of the particles in the body

 Sometimes it is mistakenly called the center of gravity when the gravitational field is uniform
 kisi vastu kaa rekhganitiya kendra, dravyaman kendra tathaa gurutv kendra alag-alag ho sakate hai
 The momentum-central instruction system is the direction system in which the mass center of the body is constant

 a mass-centroid coordinate system is a system where the center of mass is not only constant but is located at the base point of the coordinate body

 That is, the position of the code-center of an object or body of objects can be derived from the following formula- jahaan r k { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {r} _{k}} k-wein kan kaa sthiti-sadish he or m k { \ displaystyle m_{k}} k-wein kan kaa dravyaman he
 But if the distribution of codes contained in the object is continuous, then the above formula takes the following form: jahaan: If the object or body is situated in a place whose gravity is the same at all points, then the center of gravity and samhita-center will be on the same point

 Mohammad Rafi was born on 24 December 1924 near Kotla Sultan Singh, Amritsar
 aarambhik balykaal main hi inkaa parivaar lahore se amritsar aa gaya
 His family had nothing to do with music
 jab rafi chote the tab inke bade bhai kii nai dukaan thi, rafi kaa kaaphi vakt vahiin par gujarata tha
 It is said that when Rafi was seven years old, he followed a fakir passing through his elder brother's shop who used to sing from there
 uski aawaaj rafi ko pasand ai or rafi uski nakal kiya karte the
 People also liked his voice after seeing avalata in his copy
 log nai dukaan main unke gane kii prashansha karne lage
 But Rafi got nothing but local fame from this
 inke bade bhai mohammad hamid ne inke sangeet ke prati inaki ruchi ko dekha or unhen ustad abdul vaahid khan ke paas sangeet shiksha lene ko kaha
 Once Akashwani came to Lahore to perform his famous singer-actor Kundan Lal Sehgal
 isko sunne hetu mohammad rafi or unke bade bhai bhi gaye the
 Sehgal refused to sing due to the power failure
 rafi ke bade bhai ne aayojakon se nivedan kiya kii bheed kii vyagrata ko shant karne ke liye mohammad rafi ko gane kaa mauka diya jaay
 He got permission and this was Mohammad Rafi's first public performance at the age of 13
 prekshkon main shyaam sundar, jo us samay ke prasiddh sangeetkaar the, ne bhi unako suna or kaaphi prabhavit hue
 He invited Mohammad Rafi to sing for himself
 mohammad rafi kaa pratham geet ek punjabi film gul baloch ke liye tha jise unhone shyaam sundar ke nirdesan main 1944 main gaaya
 In 1946, Mohammad Rafi decided to come to Bombay
 unhen sangeetkaar naushaad ne pehle aap naam kii film main gane kaa mauka diya
 Rafi got fame in the Hindi world for the first time with the song Tera Toy Broken by Naushad
 iske baad shahid, mela tathaa dulaari main bhi rafi ne gane gaae jo bahut prasiddh hue
 In 1951, when Naushad was composing songs for the film Baiju Bawra, he thought of losing his favorite singer Talat Mehmood
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone ek baar talat mahmud ko dhumrapaan karte dekhakar apana man badal liya or rafi se gane ko kaha
 Baiju Bawra's songs established Rafi as a mainstream singer
 iske baad naushaad ne rafi ko apane nirdesan main kai geet gane ko die
 Around this time, the composer duo shankar-jaikishan liked his voice and also started singing songs from Rafi
 shankar jaykishan us samay raaj kapur ke pasandida sangeetkaar the, par raaj kapur apane liye sirf mukesh kii aawaaj pasand karte the
 Later, when the demand for Shankar Jaikishan's songs increased, he used Rafi Sahab almost everywhere
 yahan tak kii kai baar raaj kapur ke liye rafee sahab ne gaaya
 Soon, music composer Sachin Dev Burman and notably OP Nayyar got very pleased with Rafi's voice and started singing Rafi
 o pi naiyyar kaa naam isamen smaraneey rahegaa kyonki unhone apane niraale andaaj main rafi-aashaa kii jodi kaa kaaphi prayog kiya or unki khanakati dhune aaj bhi us jamaane ke anya sangeetkaaron se alag prathit hoti hai
 Rafi gained a lot of fame with the songs sung under his direction and then became the first choice of composers like Ravi, Madan Mohan, Ghulam Haider, Jaydev, Salil Chaudhary, etc
 dilip kumaar, bharat bhushan tathaa devanand jaise kalakaaron ke liye gane ke baad unke gaanon par abhinay karne waalo kalakaaron kii suchi badhati gai
 For artists like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Joy Mukherjee, Vishwajeet, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra etc
 Rafi's voice started echoing in the background
 shammi kapur to rafi kii aawaaj se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone apane har gane main rafi kaa istemaal kiya
 While OP Nayyar gave music for him, Shankar Jaikishan sometimes voiced his voice
 chaahe koi mujhe junglee kahe, ehsaan tera hoga mujhapar, ye chand sa roshan cheharaa, divaana hua badal shammi kapur ke upar filmaae gaye lokapriy gaanon main shaamil hai
 Gradually, his fame grew so much that actors started urging him to sing the song
 rajendra kumaar, dilip kumaar or dharmendra to maanate hi nahin the ki koi or gayak unke liye gaae
 
 1950 ke dashak main shankar jaykishan, naushaad tathaa sachindev burman ne rafi se us samay ke bahut lokapriy geet gavaaye
 This trend continued into the 1960s
 sangeetkaar ravi ne mohammad rafi kaa istemaal 1960 ke dashak main kiya
 In 1960, Rafi received his first Filmfare Award for the title song of the movie Chaudhvi Ka Chand
 iske baad gharaana, kaajal, do badan tathaa neelkamal jaisi filmo main in dono kii jodi ne kai yaadgaar nagamen die
 In 1961 Rafi got his second Filmfare Award for Sasural's song Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko
 sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant pyarelal ne apana aagaaz hi rafi ke swar se kiya or 1963 main film parasmani ke liye bahut sundar geet banaae
 Be safe in these and it is remarkable when remembered
 1965 main hi lakshmi-pyaare ke sangeet nirdesan main film dosti ke liye gaae geet chaahunga mai tuje sanjh savere ke liye rafi ko teesraa filmphere puraskaar mila
 In 1965, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India
 1965 main sangeetkaar jodi kalyanji-aanandji dwaara film jab jab phool khile ke liye sangitabaddh geet paradesiyon se naa akhiyaan milaanaa lokapriyata ke sheersh par pahunch gaya tha
 In 1966, the film Sooraj's song Baharon Phool Barsao became very famous and for this he received the fourth Filmfare Award
 iskaa sangeet shankar jaykishan ne diya tha
 In 1968, he received the Pachwaan Filmfare Award for Tujhko Sithakar in the film Brahmachari's song Dil Ke Jharokhe, directed by Shankar Jaikishan
 1960 ke dashak main apane kariyar ke sheersh par pahunchane ke baad dashak kaa ant unke liye sukhad nahin rahaa
 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman= avarohan ==1960 ke dashak main apane kariyar ke sheersh par pahunchane ke baad dashak kaa ant unke liye sukhad nahin rahaa
 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman se gane record karwaane ko kaha
 At that time Rafi went for Hajj
 panchamada ko apane priy gayak kishor kumaar se gavaane kaa mauka mila or unhone rup tera mastaana tathaa mere sapanom kii rani gane kishor da kii aawaaj main record karavaaya
 Both these songs became very popular and actor Rajesh Khanna of this song became very popular among the directors and public
 saath hi gayak kishor kumaar bhi janata tathaa sangeet nirdeshkon kii pehali pasand ban gaye
 After this the expiration of Rafi's singer life began
 hanlanki iske baad bhi unhone kai hit gane diye, jaise ye duniya ye mehfil, ye jo chilman he, tum jo mil gaye ho
 In 1977, he received the sixth and final Filmfare Award of his life for the song Kya Hua Tera Vaada of the film Hum Kisi Sekhon Nahi
 mohammad rafi ek bahut hi samarpit muslim, vyasano se dur rahane vaale tathaa sharmile swabhaav ke aadmi the
 During the time of independence, he preferred to stay in India during Partition
 unhone begum viqalis se shaadi kii or unki saat santan huin-chaar bete tathaa teen betiyaan
 Mohammed Rafi is also known for his greatness
 wo bahut hansmukh or dariyadil the tathaa hameshaa sabaki madad ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 He sang many film songs without taking any money or with very little money
 apane shuruaati dinon main sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant-pyarelal ke liye unhone bahut kam paison main gaaya tha
 His dispute with Lata Mangeshkar over the royalty of the songs is also indicative of his generosity
 us samay lataji kaa kahana tha ki gane gane ke baad bhi un gaanon se hone vaali aamadani kaa ek ansh gayakon tathaa gayikaon ko milanaa chahie
 Rafi saheb was against this and said that once the songs have been recorded and the singer-singers have been paid their fees, they should not expect any more money
 is baat ko lekar dono mahaan kalakaaron ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 Lata refused to sing on the set with Rafi and for years no duet song came out
 baad main abhinetri naragis ke kehane par hi dono ne saath gaanaa chaalu kiya or jewel thief film main dil pukaare gaanaa gaaya
 He died due to cardiac arrest on 31 July 1980
 rafi ne apane jivan main kul kitne gane gaae is par kuch vivaad he
 In the 1970s, the Guinness Book of World Records wrote that Lata Mangeshkar was responsible for recording the most songs, recording a total of 25,000 songs
 rafi ne iskaa khandan karte hue gineez book ko ek chitthee likhi
 Subsequent editions featured the claims of the two singers simultaneously and credited Muhammad Rafi for recording 28,000 songs between 1944 and 1980
 iske baad hui khoj main vishwaas nerurkar ne paaya ki lata ne vastav main 1989 tak keval 5,044 gane gaae the
 Other researchers have also accepted this fact as true
 iske atirikt raju bharatan ne paaya ki 1948 or 1987 ke bich keval 35,000 hindi gane ricard hue
 It is difficult to believe that Rafi sang 28,000 songs, but some sources still cite this number
 is shodh ke baad 1992 main gineez book ne gayan kaa uparokt ricard book se nikaal diya
