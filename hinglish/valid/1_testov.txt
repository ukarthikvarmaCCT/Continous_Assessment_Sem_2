 Tribes with a long history of trade with Europeans exhibit a high rate of European admixture, reflecting years of interracial marriage between European men and Native American women

 Although some commentators have reported high rates of mismatch between Native American and African Americans in recent years, genetic genealogical experts found that its frequency has decreased

 This clearly means that a very high percentage of people may have a very low percentage of paternity, but it is also suggested that earlier estimates of modulation have been very high
 Since some genetic tests only evaluate direct male or female ancestors, it is possible that a person may not discover Native American ancestry through their other ancestors
 Of an individual's 64 4X great-grandfathers, direct testing provides DNA evidence of only 2

 Although they are found more among Native Americans, they are also found in people from other parts of the world
 anuvanshiki vigyaani bhi kehete hai ki: All Native Americans have been tested, especially for large numbers of deaths from diseases such as smallpox, and it is unlikely that Native Americans are the only genetic markers to be identified

 To achieve certainty, some tribes have begun to require genealogical DNA testing, but this is usually related to proving paternity or direct ancestry from a certified member

 The Cherokee tribes required that genealogical ancestry be recorded from an Native American listed in the ancient 1906 Dawes Rolls
 The rules of recognition of members related to the ancestry of more than one clan are also equally diverse and complex

 They are listed as a proportion of the inhabitants, citing Hawaiian Native or Pacific island lineages, based on 2006 estimates: chaynit adivasee samoohan dwaara: 2000 The genetic history of Native Americans focuses primarily on human Y-chromosomal DNA haplosomes and human mitochondria DNA haplosomes

 Neither of these is recombined, and thus Y-DNA and mtdna are mutated in each generation only by coincident mutation and there is no intermingling of the parent's genetic material
 Autosomal "atdna" markers are also used, but they differ from mtdna or Y-DNA in that they characteristically overlap each other

 The genetic pattern indicates that indigenous Americans have experienced two different genetic links; First with the first arrival of people on the American continent and the second time with the European colonization of the American continent
 The first of these is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages, zygosity mutations and haplotypes present in current indigenous Amerindian mass communities

 The micro-satellite diversity and distribution of the Y-lineage assigned to South America suggests that some distinct Amerindians have remained isolated since the region's early colonization

 prishth 1396 Guru Amar Das was a great preacher of the Sikh Panth
 jinhone guru nanak ji maharaj ke jivan darshan ko va unke dwaara sthapit dharmik vicharadhara ko aage badhaaya
 ÷ The third Nanak 'guru Amar Das Ji was born on Vaisakh Sudi 14th, Samvat 1536 in Basarke Gillan, situated in Amritsar
 unke pita tej bhaan bhalla ji evam mata bakht cor ji ek sanatani hindu the or har varsh ganga ji ke darshan ke liye haridwar jaaya karte the
 Guru Amar Das Ji was married to Mata Mansa Devi Ji
 unki chaar santaanen thi
 In which there were two daughters - Bibi Dani ji and Bibi Bhani ji
 bibi bhaani ji kaa vivaah guru ramdaas sahib ji se hua tha
 He had two sons - Mohan ji and Mohari ji
 ek baar guru amardaas sahib ji ne bibi amaro ji se guru nanak sahib ke shabad sune
 He was so impressed by this that Guru went to Khadur Sahib to meet Angad Sahib
 guru angaddev sahib ji kii shiksha ke prabhaav main aakar guru amar das sahib ne unhen apana guru bana liya or wo khadur sahib main hi rahane lage
 He would wake up early in the morning and fetch water from the Beas river for the bath of Guru Angad Dev Ji
 or guru ke lungar liye jangal se lakadiyaan kaat kar laate
 Guru Angad Sahib established Guru Amardas Sahib as 'third Nanak' in March 1552 at the age of 73
 guru amardaas sahib ji kii bhakthi evam seva guru angad sahib ji kii shiksha kaa parinaam tha
 Guru Sahib made Goindwal the center of his work in a new place
 yahi baad main ek bade shahar ke rup main prasiddh hua
 Here he composed Sangat and spread Sikh ideology in a very planned manner
 unhone yahaan sikh sangat ko prachaar ke liye susangathit kiya
 Established 22 religious centers - 4 Manjis' to spread the idea
 har ek kendra yaa manji par ek prachaarak prabharee ko niyukt kiya
 In which a living Sikh preached religion according to his obligations
 guru amardaas ji ne swayan evam sikh prachaarkon ko bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon main bhejkar sikh panth kaa prachaar kiya
 He established the practice of 'guru ka langar' and made it mandatory for every devotee to first 'pagat then Sangat'
 ek baar akbar guru sahib ko dekhne aaye to unhen bhi mote anaaj se bana lungar chak kar hi phir guru sahib kaa saakshaatkaar karne kaa mauka mila
 Guru Amardas ji strongly opposed Satipratha
 unhone vidhwaa vivaah ko badhaava diya or mahilaon ko pardaa pratha tyaagane ke liye kaha
 He presented socially relevant life philosophy to the society for birth, death and marriage celebrations
 is prakaar unhone saamaajik dharaatal par ek rashtravaadi va aadhyatmik aandolan ko ukera
 In front of this ideology, there was a jihadi philosophy of Muslim radicals
 unhen in tatwon se virodh bhi jhelana padaa
 He structured three types of social and cultural union for Sangat
 ye teen samaaroh the-diwaali, vaisaakhi evam maaghi
 Guru Amardas Sahib ji constructed the Bauli at Goindwal Sahib which had 84 steps and made Goindwal Sahib a Sikh pilgrimage center for the first time in Sikh history
 unhone guru nanak sahib evam guru angad sahib ji ke shabdon ko surakshit rup main sangrakshit kiya
 He composed 869 words
 unki baani main anand sahib jaisi rachana bhi he
 Guru Arjan Dev Sahib inscribed all these words in Guru Granth Sahib
 guru sahib ne apane kisi bhi putra ko sikh guru banane ke liye yogya nahin samajha, isliye unhone apane damaad guru ramdaas sahib ko gurupad pradaan kiya
 This was an experiment righteous judgment
 bibi bhaani ji evam guru ramdaas sahib main sikh siddhanton ko samajhane evam seva kii sachhee shraddha thi or wo iske purnatah kaabil the
 This practice suggests that Gurupada can be given to anyone
 guru amardaas sahib ko dehanth 95 varsh kii aayu main bhadon sudi 14 samvat 1631 ko guru ramdaas sahib ji ko gurupad saunpane ke pashchaat guindwal sahib, jo ki amritsar ke nikat he, main hua tha
 The field in which a person works or works in different periods of life is called his livelihood or 'career' or career
 aajeevika praaia: aise kaaryon ko kehete hai jisase jivicoparjan hota he
 Teachers, doctors, engineers, managers, lawyers, workers, artists, etc
 are some livelihoods
 hamamen se prayek ko kisi na kisi str par apana jeevanyaapan karne ke liye jivicoparjan kaa saadhan chunanaa padataa he
 The business sector provides countless opportunities for self-employment and paid employment
 aaj swarozgaar, berogari dur karne kaa ek ati uttam vikalp he jisase desh kii unnati bhi hoti he
 Working for oneself is a challenge and a joy in itself
 jeevika kaa shabdic arth he : ek aisa vyavsaay, jiske dwaara jivan main aage badhane evam unnati ke avasaron kaa laabh uthaaya ja sake
 It is not intended to be a mere selection of employment / livelihood
 iskaa taatpary un vibhinn padon se hai, jo kriyasheel jivan main koi vyakti praapt kar saktaa he
 In the broad sense, sustenance is an important aspect of a person's life structure
 udhaaharan ke liye aapako karyaalay sahaayak kaa pad miltaa he
 You can become an office superintendent later and may reach the office of office manager
 vyavsaay kaa arth he kisi vyakti dwaara jivan main unnati karnaa visheshtya us vyakti se sambandhit vyavsaay ke sambandh main
 Business is generally a long-term work done by a person who does his job / livelihood while maintaining his position while in service

 For example, a lawyer in his personal business conducts different legal businesses of many different firms
 alag-alag kshetron main alag-alag vyavaay jo aap karte hai
 It can be called the way of your business and it also affects your day to day routine
 vyavsaay se hi kisi kii sthiti kaa pataa bhi chalata he ki jo us vyakti ne apni yogyata tathaa kshamta viksit kii he
 The choice of livelihood is an important aspect of life
 apni yogyata ke anusaar ek vishesh vyavsaay kaa chunaav jo ham apane bhavishya ke liye karte hai, uskaa aaj ke pratiyogi jivan main bahut mahatv he
 The attitude you choose is the foundation of your future
 pehle, log apni shiksha puri karte the, phir apni jeevika kaa nirnay karte the
 But today's generation takes steps towards building their future before completing their school education
 jeevika kaa chunaav kisi vyakti kii jivan style ko anya kisi ghatana kii tulana main sabase adhik prabhavit karata he
 Functions affect many forms of our lives
 hamaare jivan main mulyon, drushtikon evam hamaari pravritiyon ko jivan kii ore prabhavit karata he
 In the world of this fierce competition, right choice related to livelihood is very important
 isiilie ek aisi prakriya kii aavashyaktaa he, jo kisi vyakti ko vibhinn jivan vrittiyon se avgat karaae
 In this process, a person gets to know his abilities and abilities, which are an important part of life related decision
 chunauti pratiyogita aaj ke samaaj ke mukhya ang he, isliye jeevika kii yojana bananaa hi keval yah bataata he ki hamen jivan main kya karnaa he or ham kya karnaa chaahate he? naa ki baar-baar or jaldi-jaldi apane vyavsaay athwa kaary ko uddeshyheen tareeke se badalanaa
 What do we currently have! We know this only by choosing our livelihood
 ham sabhi kii kuch aakankshaayen hoti he or ham sabhi bhavishya main sthirataa chaahate hai
 Hence the choice of career serves as a key
 koi vyakti apane bare main uchit vishleshan karke uchit nirnay le saktaa he
 The selection of career starts mainly on completion of high school or intern
 uske pashchaat snaatak kii padhai vyakti ko acchhee tathaa sulabh jeevika chunane main sahaayak hoti he
 The choice of livelihood plays an important role in making the future smooth for us
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi vyakti banker bananaa chahta he to vah ‘‘indian cast and work accountant’’ charted accountint, master of bijness euministration ;vittaddh kaa course karnaa chahega
 Livelihood selection is a task that keeps us motivated to study and progress throughout our lives, and our interests and needs keep us moving towards change as we do
 jab koi vyakti kisi vyavsaay main laga hota he to ham kehete hai ki vah rojgaar main he
 Every person's business is associated with some economic activity
 har vyakti apane bhavishya ke nirmaan ke liye kisi na kisi rojgaar main laganaa chahta he arthath apni aajeevika kamaane ke liye kisi na kisi aarthik kriya main lag jaataa he
 To make a living, one has to choose from the following options: # job # self-employment naukari kaa arth he kisi duusare kii mazdooree athwa vetan ke badale main kaary karnaa
 If someone is appointed to the post of office assistant, he will do the work that his supervisor assigns to him
 apane kaary ke badale main pratimaas use vetan milegaa
 This type of employment is based on the contract between the employer and the employee
 karmchaaree apane maalik ke liye kaary karata he
 He does the work that his boss gives him to do
 iske badale main use uskaa pratifal miltaa he
 During his tenure, he works under the supervision and control of the owner
 duusari ore swarozgaar kaa arth he apni jeevika kamaane ke liye swayan kisi aarthik kriya ko karnaa
 Let's first briefly learn about the various job opportunities

 But one can do any work at his place of work / job and earn his livelihood
 aap ek dawaaiyon kii dukaan chalaa sakate hai yaa phir ek darji kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 If a person performs an economic activity and manages it on his own, it is called self-employment
 har ilaake main aap chote-chote store, marammat karne vaali dukaane athwa seva pradaan karne vaali ikaiyaan dekhte hai
 Only one person owns and manages these establishments
 kabhi-kabhi ek yaa do vyaktiyon ko vah apane sahaayak ke rup main rakh letaa he
 Grocery stores, stationery shops, book shops, drug houses, tailor shops, barber shops, telephone booths, beauty parlors, electrical, bicycle etc
 repair shops are examples of self-employment based actions
 in bhandaron athwa dukaanon ke swami prabandhk kray-vikray kriyaaon athwa seva kaaryon se aay arjeet karte hai jo unki jeevika kaa saadhan he
 If their income is less than the expenditure, then they lose, which they have to bear
 jab aap swarozgaar kii yojana banaaen to aap iske liye nimnlikhit avasaron ko dhyaan main rakh sakate hai : Self-employment is often considered better than pay for the following reasons: genetic elgorithm ek search takanic he jiskaa upyog ishtatameekaran tathaa khojane kii samasyaon ke liye sateek yaa sannikat hal praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This algorithm is one of many developmental algorithms
 vikasaatmak kalanvidhiyaan, vikaswad tathaa usase sambandhit avadharanaon takneekon ke anusaran par aadhaarit hai
 The implementation of a genetic algorithm is performed in a computer simulation, in which a population of an abstract representation or a chromosome of what is called a candidate's solution for optimizing a problem) develops a better solution
 paramparaagat rup se, samaadhaan ko 0 or 1 kii shrinkhalaa ke rup main dwiadhari main vyakt kiya jaataa he, lekin anya encoding bhi sambhav he
 Development usually begins with randomly generated individuals and occurs in generations
 prayek peedhee main, prayek vyakti kii fitness kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he, vartmaan aabaadi se stocastic rup se kai vyaktiyon kaa chayan kiya jaataa he or nayi aabaadi ke nirmaan ke liye unamem sanshodhan kiya jaataa he 
 The new population is then used in the next step of the algorithm
 saamanytah, elgorithm tab khatm hota he jab yaa to pidhiyon kii adhiktam sankhya utpann ho chuki ho yaa aabaadi ke liye ek santoshjanak fitness kaa str praapt kiya ja chukaa ho
 If the algorithm is terminated by the maximum number of generations, a satisfactory solution may or may not be achieved
 anuvanshik elgorithm jaev soochna, filogenetics, computesnal vigyaan, abhiyantriki, arthshaastra, rasayan vigyaan, vinirmaan, ganit, bhautikee or anya kshetron main anuprayog praapt karata he
 a typical genetic algorithm is required: samaadhaan kaa ek maanak pratinidhitiv bit kii ek ere he
 Arrays of other types and structures can be used in essentially the same way
 mukhya gun jo in anuvanshik pratinidhitivon ko suvidhajanak banaata he, vah yah he ki unke bhaag unke nishchit aakaar ke kaaran aasaani se sanrekhit ho jate hai, jo saadhaaran crosover kriyavidhi ko aasaan banaata he
 The variable length representation can also be used, but in this case the crossover implementation becomes more complex
 vriksh ke prakaar ke pratinidhitiv anuvanshik programing main prakat hote hai or pratinidhitiv se praapt graph vikasvaadi programing main prakat hote hai
 The fitness function is defined on the genetic representation and measures the quality of the solution represented
 fitness function hameshaa samasya par nirbhar karata he
 For example, in the knapsack problem one wants to maximize the total value of an object that can be placed in a knapsack of a certain capacity
 ek samaadhaan kii abhivyakti bits kii ek ere ho sakati he, jahaan prayek bit ek bhinn object ko abhivyakt karata he or bit kaa maan abhivyakt karata he ki object nepsek main he yaa nahin
 Not every such expression is valid, because the size of the object exceeds the capacity of the knapsack is unity
 samaadhaan kii fitness nepsek main sabhi objects ke maan ke yoga ke baraabar he yadi abhivyakti maanya he yaa anyathaa 0 he
 In some problems, it is either difficult or impossible to define an expression of fitness; In these cases, interactive genetic algorithms are used
 ek baar jab ham anuvanshik abhivyakti or fitness function ko paribhaashit kar lete hai, GA samaadhaan kii aabaadi ko shuru karne ke liye aage badhata he, phir utparivartan, crosover, utkraman or chayan operataron ke madhyam se isamen sudhaar karata he
 Initially several individual solutions are randomly generated to form an initial population
 aabaadi kaa aakaar samasya kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he, lekin isamen praroopik rup se kai sankadon hajaaron sambhav samaadhaan hote hai
 Traditionally, populations are generated randomly and cover the full range of possible solutions
 Sometimes, solutions can be "started" in areas where optimal solutions are likely to be found
 prayek agali peedhee ke dauraan, ek nayi peedhee ke prajnan ke liye maujuuda aabaadi ke ek anupaat kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 Individual solutions are selected through a fitness-based process, where typically more fit solutions are more likely to be selected
 vishisht chayan vidhiyaan prayek samaadhaan ki fitness ko nirdhaarit karti hai or sarvottam samaadhaan ke chunaav ko praathamikta detii hai
 Other methods determine only a random sample of the population, as this process may take too long
 adhikansh function stocastic hote hai or unhen is prakaar se dizin kiya jaataa he ki kam feet samaadhaan ke ek chote anupaat kaa chayan kiya jaye
 yah bure samaadhaan par samay purv abhisaran ko rokte hue, aabaadi kii vividhta ko bada banane main madad karata he
 Popular and well-selected methods include Roulette Wheel Selection and Tournament Selection
 anuvaanshik oparator ke madhyam se chayan kiye gaye samaadhaan kii duusari peedhee kii aabaadi ko utpann karne kaa aglaa charan he: crossover bhi kehalaata he) or / yaa utparivartan 
 For each new solution to be generated, a pair of "parent" solutions is selected, so as to breed from the pool previously selected
 Using the above method of cross-over and mutation, a new solution is produced by producing a "child or child" solution, which typically has many of the characteristics of its "parent"
 prayek bachche ke liye nae janak kaa chayan kiya jaataa he or yah prakriya tab tak jari rahati he jab tak upyukt aakaar ke samaadhaan kii ek nayi aabaadi utpann nahin ho jaati he
 Although breeding methods that are based on the use of two parents are "more inspired by biology", recent research suggests that using more than two "parents" to breed a good quality chromosome Is better for in prakriyaaon ke parinamswaroop antat gunasutron kii agali peedhee kii aabaadi utpann hoti he jo praarambhik peedhee se alag hoti he
 Typically this process will increase the average fitness for the population, since only the best organisms are selected for reproduction from the first generation, with a small proportion of less fit solutions taken, the reasons for the above
 Huh

 The general conditions for termination are: anuvanshik elgoritham ke madhyam se samaadhaan kii peedhee ke bare main kai saamaanya prekshan hai: Very expensive fitness function evaluations are often required to find solutions to complex high dimensional, multimodal problems

 Typical optimization method cannot deal with this type of problem
 is maamle main, sambhavatya yah jaruri ho saktaa he ki ek sateek moolyankan ko chhod diya jaye or ek aise sanniktan fitness kaa prayog kiya jaye jo sanganana kii drushti se prabhavi he
 It appears that the blending of adjacent samples may be one of the most promising approaches that deliberately uses EA to solve complex real-life problems

 This problem can be alleviated by the use of a different fitness function, by increasing the rate of mutation, or by using selective techniques that maintain a diverse population of solutions, although the No Free Lunch Theorem proves that There is no general solution to the problem

 Diversity is important in genetic algorithms because the crossing over of a homogeneous population does not provide new solutions
 vikaas ranneetiyon or vikaas programing main, utparivartan par adhik nirbharta ke kaaran vividhta jaruri nahin he
 Several methods have been proposed as a remedy for this, such as increasing genetic diversity in some way and preventing early convergence, either by increasing the probability of mutation when the quality of the solution drops, or ever Ever through completely new, randomly generated elements in the gene pool
 Implemented development strategies and developmental programming with a so-called "coma strategy"
 Can be, in which parents are not maintained and the choice of new parents are made only child
 yah gatisheel samasyaon par adhik prabhavi ho saktaa he
 In these cases, a random search can find a solution as quickly as a GA
 However, if the situation is such that the success / failure test is repeated giving different results, then the ratio of success and failure provides an appropriate fitness measure
 kuch log yah tark dete hai ki krosover sabase adhik mahatvapurn he, jabaki utparivartan keval yah sunishchit karne ke liye aavashyak he ki sambhavi samaadhaan khoye nahin hai
 Others argue that only crossover in very flat populations leads to innovations that originated from mutations, and in a non-flat population, crossover is almost always equivalent to a very large mutation

 The same is certainly true for development strategies and development programming
 vaikalpik or poorak elgoritham main shaamil hai vikaas kii ranneetiyaan, vikaas kii programing, simulated aneling, gousi anukulan or swarm hoshiyaari, or purnank raikhik programing par aadhaarit vidhiyaan 
 The question of which problem is suitable for genetic algorithms is open and controversial

 This theory is also not devoid of support although it is based on theoretical and experimental results
 The basic algorithm performs crossover and mutation at the bit level

 Crossovers and mutations are performed with reference to the data element boundary
 adhikansh data prakaar ke liye, vishisht vibhedan operataron ko dizin kiya ja saktaa he
 Different chromosomal data types work better or worse for different specific problem domains
 jab purnank ke bit shrinkhalaa nirupan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, grey koding ko aksar kaam main liya jaataa he
 In this way, small changes in the integer can be affected by mutations or cross-over shortly

 Other approaches include using arrays of real-value numbers rather than using bit series to express chromosomes
 Theoretically, the smaller the character, the better the performance, but ironically, good results have been obtained using chromosomes of the real value
