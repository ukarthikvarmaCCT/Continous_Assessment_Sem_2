 Ismail al-faruqi and Taha Jabir Alalwani are of the view that any revival of Muslim civilization must begin with the Quran; However, the biggest obstacle on this passage is the centuries-old legacy of "tafsir and other classical disciplines that prevent the" universal, epistemological, and systematic conception "of the Quranic message

 It is generally accepted that there are around 750 verses in the Quran dealing with natural phenomena

 quran kaa sandesh vibhinn saahitiyik sanrachanaon or upkarnon ke saath vyakt kiya gaya he
 In native Arabic, the surya and verses employ phonetic and thematic structures that aid the audience's efforts to recall the message of the text
 muslim jor den ki quran kii saamagree or style anuchit he
 The language of the Quran is described as "poetry prose" because it is part of both poetry and prose; However, this description runs the risk of failing to convey the rhythmic quality of the Quranic language, which is more poetic in some parts and more prose-like in others
 quran, jabaki puure quran main paaya gaya tha, pehle ke kai makka suras main vishisht he, jisamen apekshaakrit kam chand gayan ke shabdon ko pramukhataa main phenk dete hai
 The effectiveness of such a form is evident for example in Sura 81, and there is no doubt that these passages influenced the audience's conscience
 chhandon ke ek set se duusare signal main aksar kavita kaa parivartan charchaa ke vishay main ek badlaav hota he
 Later sections also preserve this form but the style is more expository

 Michael Bells, citing Brown's work, accepts Brown's observation that the seemingly disintegration of Quranic literary expression - its scattered or fragmented mode of sale phrase - is in fact a literary device capable of giving deep impact
 As if the intensity of the prophetic message was breaking the vehicle of human language in which it was being conveyed
 bechnaa quran kii adhik charchaa kii punrariti ko bhi sambodhit karata he, ise ek saahitiyik upkaran ke rup main bhi dekhtaa he

 stephen wild ke anusaar, quran sancharit hone vaale shabdon ko samajhane, vargeekrut karne, vyakhya karne or nyaaysangat karke is metatextility ko darshata he
 Self-referentiality is evident in those paragraphs where the Quran refers to itself as revealing itself in a self-sufficient way, as news, as a norm
 ek dhanya yaad he jise hamane neeche bhej diya he, to kya aap ab ise asweekaar kar rahe hai? "), yaa" kahen "tag kii lagaataar upasthiti main, jab mohammad ko bolne kaa aadesh diya jaataa he

 Main article: Tafsir quran ne quran ke chhandon ke arthon ko samajhane, unke aayaat ko spasht karne or unke mahatv ko jaanane ke uddeshy se tippanee or vyakhya kaa ek vishaal nikaay udaaya he
 Tafsir is one of the earliest educational activities of Muslims
 quran ke anusaar, mohammad pehla vyakti tha jisane praarambhik musalamaanon ke liye chhandon ke arthon kaa varnan kiya tha
 Other early bodies included some of Muhammad's companions, such as 'ali ibn Abi Talib,' Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar and Ubayy ibn Kab
 un dinon main akjejesis kavita ke saahitiyik pahaluon, iske prakaashan kii prishthbhumi or kabhi-kabhi, duusare kii madad se ek kavita kii vyakhya ke spashtikaran tak hi simit tha
 If the poem was about a historical event, some traditions of Muhammad were sometimes described to illustrate its meaning
 chunki quran shastreey arabi main boli jaati he, baad main kai islam main parivartit nahin hote the, ve hameshaa kuranik arabi ko nahin samajhate the, unhone un musalamaanon ko nahin pakadaa jo musalamaanon ke arabi main dharapravaah the or ve sulajhane se chintit the quran main vishyon ke spasht sangharsh
 Commentators who commented in Arabic explained the signs, and perhaps most importantly explained that the Quranic verses were revealed in Muhammad's prophetic career, which was appropriate for the earliest Muslim community, and which was later revealed Was done, canceling or "abrogating" Nasakh) earlier text
 haalanki, anya vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main koi nirasan nahin hua he
 The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has published a ten-volume Urdu commentary on the Quran, titled Tafsir e Kabir
 gudh vyakhya yaa sufi vyakhya quran ke aantarik arthon kaa anaavaran karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Sufism transcends the explicit point of the verses and instead relates Quranic verses to the inner or esoteric and spiritual dimensions of consciousness and existence
 sands ke anusaar, gudh vyakhyaayein ghoshnaatmak se adhik suchak hai, ve spashtikaran ke bajaay sanket hai
 They indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of each author

 Quran 7: 143 says: jab musa us vakt aayaa jab hamane niyukt kiya, or uske allaah ne usase baat kii, to usne kaha, 'he mere allaah, mujhe apane aap ko dikhaao! mujhe tumhe dekhne do!' usne kaha, 'tum mujhe nahin dekhoge, lekin us pahaad ko dekho, agar yah drudh rahata he to aap mujhe dekhenge
 'when his lord revealed himself on the mountain, he spoiled it
 musa behosh ho gaya
 When he recovered, he said, 'hail! i repent to you! I'm the first to believe it! 7: 143 main musa, prem main rahane waalon kaa maarg aata he, vah ek drushti maangata he lekin uski ichha se inkaar kiya jaataa he, use pahaad ke alaava anya dekhne ke liye ajna di jaati he, jabaki parvat dekhne main sakasham hota he parameshwar

 sufi ke drushtikon se, bhagwaan hameshaa priy or raste main rahane vaale kii ichha or pidaa sachai ko saakaar karne kaa kaaran banati he
 Muhammad Husayn Tababatei states that according to popular explanations among later passages, tawil means that a verse has been instructed
 tawal ke virodh main, prakaashan kaa arth, shabdon ke spasht arth ke anusaar spasht he, jaisaa ki unhen bataaya gaya tha
 But this explanation has become so widespread that, at present, it has become the primary meaning of tawil, which originally meant "to return" or "return place"
 tabatai ke vichaar main, jise taivil yaa quran kii harmenutic vyakhya kaha jaataa he, ko shabdon ke sanket ke saath chintit nahin he
 Rather, it deals with some truths and realities that are beyond the comprehension of the common part of men; Yet it is from these truths and realities that the doctrine of doctrine and the practical prohibition of the Quran continue
 vyakhya kavita kaa arth nahin he balki yah us arth ke madhyam se pargaman ke ek vishesh prakaar main paardarshee he
 There is a spiritual reality — which is the main purpose of obeying a law, or the basic purpose of describing a divine attribute — and then there is a real significance that a Quranic story refers to
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar, jo mohammad or imam jaise gyaan main dridhtaa se nihit hai, quran ke rahasyon ko jaanate hai
 According to Tabatai, the statement "no one knows its interpretation except God" remains valid without any adversary or qualification clause
 isliye, jahaan tak is kavita kaa sawaal he, quran kii vyakhya kaa gyaan bhagwaan ke liye arakshit he
 But Tabatabaei uses other verses and concludes that those who are purified by God know to some extent the interpretation of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, sweekaarya or asweekaarya gudh vyakhyaayein hai
 Acceptable ta'wil refers to the meaning of a poem beyond its literal meaning; Rather the underlying meaning, which is ultimately known only to God and cannot be directly understood through human thought alone
 prashn main chand yahaan aane, jane, baithne, santushti, krodh or dukh ke maanviya gunon ko sanderbhit karte hai, jinhen spasht rup se bhagwaan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he 
 The unacceptable ta'wil is one where the apparent meaning of a poem "transfers" to a different meaning through a proof; This method is not without obvious discrepancies
 yadhyapi yah asweekaarya ta'vil ne kaaphi sweekruti praapt kii he, yah galat he or kuranik chhandon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The correct interpretation is that reality refers to a poem
 yah sabhi chhandon main paaya jaataa he, nirnaayak or aspasht ek jaise; yah shabd kaa arth nahin he; yah ek tathy he ki shabdon ke liye bahut shandaar he
 God has prepared them with words to bring a little to their minds; In this respect they are like stories that are used to create a picture in the mind, and thus help the listener to clearly understand the intended idea

 salaphis or jahiri ke vipareet, shiya or sufis ke saath-saath kuch anya muslim darshanikon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa arth shabdic pahalu tak hi simit nahin he
 For him, it is an essential idea that the Quran also has internal aspects
 henry corbin ek haddees kaa varnan karata he jo mohammad waapas jaataa he: The Quran has external presence and a hidden depth, an extraordinary meaning and an esoteric meaning
 badale main yah gudh arth ek gudh arth chhupaata he 
 So this goes for seven esoteric meanings
 is vichaar ke anusaar, yah bhi spasht ho gaya he ki quran kaa aantarik arth apane bahari arth ko khatm yaa amaanya nahin karata he
 Instead, it is like the soul, which gives life to the body

 ek gudh slant ke saath tippaneekaron kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa antim arth keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In contrast, Quranic literalism, followed by Salafis and Zahris, is the belief that the Quran should be taken only in its explicit meaning
 punarmoolyankan kuch purv musalamaanon kii harmeniuteel style kaa naam he jo isai dharm main parivartit ho gaye hai
 His style or repetition is ad hoc and non-systematic and geared towards apologizing

 chalane vaale prakaar ke saath mudrit pehla purna quran venice main 1537 / 1538 main paginino paganini or elesendro paganini dwaara turk bazaar ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 Two further editions include those published by the clergy Abraham Hinkelmann in Hamburg in 1694, and the Italian priest Padua in Ludovico Marakki in 1698 with Latin translations and commentaries
 is avadhi ke dauraan quran kii mudrit pratiyaan muslim kanoonee vidwaanon se majboot virodh ke saath mulaakaat kii : arabi main kuch bhi print karnaa 1483 or 1726 ke bich turk samrajya main pratibandhit tha -shuruyaat main, mrityu ke dand par bhi
 In 1726 the Ottoman ban on printing in Arabic script was lifted for non-religious texts at the request of Ibrahim Mutérica, who printed his first book in 1729
 bahut kam kitaaben, or koi dharmik granth mudrit nahin kiya gaya tha ek or shatabdi ke liye turk samrajya main
 In 1786, Catherine the Great of Russia sponsored a printing press for "tatar and Turkish orthography" in St
 Petersburg, with a mullah Usman Ismail responsible for Arabic-type production
 1787 main is press ke saath ek quran mudrit kiya gaya tha, 1790 or 1793 main saint petersburg main or 1 99 3 main kazan main punarnirmit kiya gaya tha 
 The first edition printed in Iran appeared in Tehran, a translation in Turkish was printed in Cairo in 1842, and the first officially accepted Ottoman version was finally printed in Constantinople between 1875 and 1877 as a two-volume set, first
 During the constitutional era
 gustav flugel 1834 main quran ke ek sanskaran prakashit main lipzig he, jo ek sadi ke kareeb ke liye aadhikarik bane rahe, jab tak kairo ke al ajahar vishvavidhyalay quran ke ek sanskaran prakashit 1924 main is sanskaran ek lambey taiyaari ke parinaam ke rup main yah kuran manakikrut tha orthography or baad ke sanskarnon kaa aadhaar bana hua he
 Quranic statements on the creation of the universe and the earth, origins of human life, biology, earth science and so on have been criticized by developing theories such as foreclosure, unscientific, and scientific theories that are likely to be contradicted
 kai vidwaanon ne kaha he ki khud ko spasht pustak kehane ke baavjood spashtataa kii kami he
 See also: Biblical descriptions and Quran and Torat quran purv pustakon ) ke saath sambandhon ke bare main acchhee tarah se bolta he or unki samaantaaon ko unke adwitiya utpatti ke gun detaa he or kahata he ki un sabhi ko ek allaah ne prakat kiya he
 The language of the Quran was similar to the Syriac language
 quran yahudee or isai pavitra kitabon or bhakthi sahitya main sunai gai kai logon or ghatnaon kii kahaniyon ko yaad karata he, haalanki yah kai vivaranon main bhinn he
 Adam, Idris, Noah, Eber, Saleh, Abraham, Lot, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Shoaib, David, Solomon, Elijah, Elisha, Yunus, Aaron, Moses, Zacharias, John Jesus, mention of Rasool in the Quran And has been performed as a prophet
 vastav main, quran main kisi anya vyakti kii tulana main musa kaa adhik ullekh kiya gaya he
 Jesus is more frequently mentioned in the Quran than Muhammad, while Mary is mentioned in the Quran and not in the Gospel
 bahaai or drus jaise kuch gaiyr-muslim samooh quran ko pavitra maanate hai
 Unitarian Universalists also draw inspiration from the Quran
 diateceron, james kii protevangelin, infansi gospel of thomas, gospel of sudo maitheus jaisi kitabon ke saransh kuran se samanthaayen rakhte hai
 One scholar has suggested that diatesiron as a gospel harmony may have given rise to the notion that the Christian gospel is a text
 quran ke avataran ke baad, or islam ke saamaanya udai, arabi varnmaala teji se ek kala rup main viksit hua
 According to Wadad Kadi, Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago, and Mustassir Mir, Professor of Islamic Studies at Youngstown State University: mukhya kshetron jisamen quran ne arabi sahitya par dhyaan dene yogya prabhaav daalaa, ve dictionari or theme hai; anya kshetra quran ke saahitiyik pahaluon se vishesh rup se shapath, roopak, ruparekha or pratikon se sambandhit hai
 As far as the novel is concerned, one can say that Quranic words, idioms and expressions, especially "weighted" and formulaic phrases, appear in practically all genres of literature and in such abundance That it is impossible to compile his complete record
 quran ne na keval apane sandesh ko vyakt karne ke liye ek puri tarah se nai bhashaai corpus banaaya he, balki yah puraane arthon ke saath puraani, purv islamic shabdon ko bhi sampann karata he or yah un arthon se he jo bhashaa main or baad main sahitya main jaden lete hai 


 Allah has sent man to this earth as his caliph
 bhejne se purv usne har vyakti ko thik thik samajha diya tha ki ve thode samay ke liye dharti par ja rahe hai, uske baad unhen uske paas laut kar aana he
 Where he will get good or bad revenge for his actions which he did on earth
 Man has freedom to work on this earth
 dharti ke sadhano ko upyog karne kii chhot he
 There is no restriction or reward on doing good and bad work
 kintu is swatantraaa ke saath ishwar ne dharti par based manushyon ko thik us rup main jivan guzaarane ke liye ishwariya adeshon ke pahunchane kaa prabandh kiya or dharti ke har bhaag main usne apane doot bheje, jinhone manushyon tak ishwar kaa sandesh bheja
 The number of such messengers is said to be around 1,84,000
 is silsile kii antim kadi hazarat mohammad the
 No messenger will come after you, but Hazrat Jesus will spend the rest of his life on this earth again
 ishwar kii antim kitaab aapke haath main he koi or ishwariya kitaab ab nahin aegi
 His message was one, his mission was one, to teach human beings to live according to the divine command, for thousands of years of constant prophets, whether they had descended into any part of the earth
 hazaron varshon kaa samay bitne ke kaaran ishwariya adeshon main manushya apane vichaar, apni suvidha jod kar nayaa dharm bana lete or mul dharm ko vikrut kar ek aadambar khadaa kar dete or kai baar to ishwariya adeshon ke viparit kaary karte
 Because every effective person wanted to see everyone bow down before his power
 akhir antim nabi hazarat mohammad koran ke saath is dharti par aae or koran ishwar ke is chalange ke saath aayaa ki isaki raksha swayan ishwar karegaa
 a long time of 1500 years suggests that even after all the efforts of the Quranic opponents, not a single word of the Quran has been changed
 yah kitaab apane mul swaroop main pralay tak rahegi
 Along with this, the challenge of the Quran is still in place that those who do not consider it to be a divine book, they should show a complete book like this and not just a small part of it
 koran ke is rup ko jaanane ke baad yah jaan lijie ki yah kitaab rup main hazarat mohammad ko nahin di gai ki ise padhakar logon ko suna den or chhap kar har ghar main rakh den
 Rather, from time to time for 23 years, this book has emerged as per requirement and you have made the society on earth according to his orders at the will of God, as God had ordered
 pashchimi vichaarak ech
ji
wales ke anusaar is dharti par pravachan to bahut die gaye kintu un pravachanon ke aadhaar par ek samaaj kii rachana pehali baar hazarat mohammad ne karke dikhaai
 It would be interesting to know here that Wales is not an Islam lover but anti-islam and his books have been published in opposition to Islam
 vaigyanik tathy jo ab tak hamen gyaat hai, koran main chupe hai or aise saikadon sthaan he jahaan lagata he ki manushya gyaan abhi us haqiqat tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Again and again the Quran gives you a feast to ponder
 zamin or aasmaan ke rahasyon ko jaanane kaa aamantran detaa hai
 a confusion ensues
 kuran ke daawey ke anusaar vah puri dharti ke manushyon ke liye or shesh samay ke liye he, kintu uske sambodhit us samay ke arab nazar aate hai
 It seems cursory that the Qur'an was only for the Arabs of that time, but whenever you reach a place when it seems that this thing is only for a particular time and country, then stop there
 Think or note it and consider it later, you will feel that every time a human being is one of every age and every terrain, and the same thing applies to them as the people of that time
 Used to apply to Arabs
 musalamaanon ke liye koran ke sambandh main badi badi kitaaben likhi gai hai or likhi ja sakati hai
 The purpose here is to give a brief introduction of the Qur'an and clarify what is right on its Ummah
 hazarat ali se rivaayat kii gai ek haddees he
 Hazrat Haris states that when i entered the mosque, i saw some people quarreling in some problems
 main hazarat ali ke paas gaya or unhen is baat kii soochna di
 Hazrat Ali ordered - Did these things happen? i said yes
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- yaad rakho maine rasul allaah se suna he
 You ordered - Beware, a big head will be raised near me, i have requested - what will be the means of getting rid of this situation? The Book of Allah
 koran kaa sara nichod is ek haddees main aa jaataa he
 The last book of Allah on the Qur'an is in line with his fame
 yah atyant aasaan he or yah bahut kathin bhi he
 Easy when it is read to remember
 yadi aap kii niyat main khot nahin he or koran se hidaayat chaahate hai to allaah ne is kitaab ko aasaan bana diya he
 This is the easiest book in the world to understand and remember
 khud koran me he 'or hamane koran ko samajhane ke liye aasaan kar diya he, to koi he ki soche or samajhe?' On the other hand, from the point of view of telescopes, it is the world's hardest book, even after spending entire life it is not possible to measure its depth
 is drushti se dekha jaae to yah ek samudr he
 Houses have passed and the miracle of the Quran still prevails
 or sadiyaan biit jaaengi kintu koran kaa chamatkaar kabhi samaapt nahin hoga
 The only easy way to get instruction is to pay attention to the persistent verses and believe in the verses that this too is from Allah
 duniya nirantar pragati kar rahi he, maanav gyaan nirantar bad rahaa he, jo koran main kal mutshabihaat tha aaj vah spasht ho chukaa he, or kal uske kuch ore bhaag spasht honge
 Similarly, two different methods have to be adopted for learning
 adeshon ke lihaaz se koran main vichaar karne vaale ko peeche kii ore yatra kerani hogi
 The meaning of the Qur'an's order was seen by theologians, scholars (tabatabai, Tabai'in)
 ) or sahaba ne iskaa kya arth liya
 Even to give himself to the steps of Hazrat Muhammad, what was the order of the Quran itself? duusari ore gyanvigyaan ke lihaaz se aage or nirantar aage vichaar karnaa hoga
 Go beyond it not just with time
 manushya ke gyaan kii sataha nirantar oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 The Quran has the highest level of science, considering that new inventions, discoveries and scientific facts can be worked on
 muajaza us chamatkaar ko kehete hai jo kisi nabi yaa rasul ke haath par ho or maanav shakti se pare ho, jis par maanav budhdi hairaan ho jaae
 In the same way, there are many more
 har yug main jab bhi koi rasul ishwariya adeshon ko maanav tak pahunchataa, tab use allaah kii ore se chamatkaar die jate the
 Hazrat Musa was granted as many miracles
 hazarat isa ko murdon ko jivit karnaa, bimaaron ko thik karne kaa muajaza diya gaya
 The real opportunity of any prophet is that which he presents with a claim
 hazarat mohammad ke haath par saikadon maajaze varnit hai, kintu jo daawey ke saath pesh kiya gaya or jo aaj bhi chamatkaar ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh maujuud he, vah he koran jiskaa yah chelenz duniya ke samaksh anuttarit he ki iske ek bhaag jaisaa hi bana kar dikhaa diya jaae
 This claim was made at many places in the Quran
 The Qur'an will be completely safe, the claim has passed 1500 years and the Qur'an is safe, completely safe
 yah siddh ho chukaa he, jo ek chamatkaar he
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran vigyaan kii kasuti par khara utraa he, or uske vaigyanik varnanon ke aage vaigyanik natmastak hai
 This is also a miracle
 1500 varsh purv arab ke registan main ek anpadh vyakti ne aisi kitaab prastut kii jo beesvin sadi ke saare sadhano ke saamne apni satyata zaahir kar rahi he
 If any other book has done this work other than the Quran, the world would like to know its name
 koran kaa yah chamatkaarik rup aaj hamaare liye he or ho saktaa he aage aane vaale samay ke liye uskaa koi or chamatkaarik rup saamne aae
 When the Quran was incarnated, its main miracle in that era was not its scientific basis
 us yug main koran kaa chamatkaar tha uski bhashaa, sahitya, vagmita, jisane apane samay ke arabon ke bhashaa gyaan ko jhakzor diya tha
 It would be appropriate to clarify here that the Arabs of that time were so proud of their language knowledge that they called the people of the rest of the world Ajami
 koran kii style ke kaaran arab ke bhashaa gyaniyon ne apane ghutane tech die
 The Quran is a book based on which a revolution was brought
 registan ke aise anpadh logon ko jinka vishwa ke nakshe main us samay koi mahatv nahin tha
 Due to the teachings of the Quran, the training of his presenter brought him to the great powers of that time and a Quranic society was created in just 23 years which the world can never answer
 aaj bhi duniya maanati he ki koran or hazarat mohammad ne ek adarsh samaaj kii rachana kii
 From this point of view, if you study the Qur'an, then you have to walk with it
 uski shiksha par amal karen
 Not only in private life but in social, political and legal areas, then all those characters mentioned in the Quran will be seen alive
 ve sari kathinaayee or ve sari pareshaani saamne ajaaengi
 If the gang rises for this work with body, mind, money, then the instruction of the Quran will guide it at every turn
 koran allaah kii rassi he
 There is a hadith described by Hazrat Zaid bin Araqam in the Tirmizi which states that the Qur'an is the rope of Allah which stretches from the ground to the Assaman
 yah shabd huzur ke he jinhe hazarat zayd ne varnit kiya he
 In the same way, there are many more
 tabraani main varnit ek or haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki ek din huzur masjid main tasharif laae to dekha kuch log ek kone main baithe koran pard rahe hai or ek duusare ko samajha rahe hai
 Seeing this, a wave of happiness ran over your face
 aap sahaba ke us gut ke paas pahunche or un se kaha- kya tum maanate ho ki allaah ke atirikt koi anya mabood nahin he, main allaah kaa rasul hun or koran allaah kii kitaab he? sahaba ne kaha, yaa rasul allaah ham gavaahi dete hai ki allaah ke atirikt koi mabood nahin, aap allaah ke rasul hai or koran allaah kii kitaab he
 Then you said, rejoice that the Quran is the rope of Allah with one end in his hand and the other in your hand
 The Qur'an is also the rope of Allah in the sense that it binds the Muslims together
 unamem vichaaron kii ekta, mat bhinnata ke samay allaah ke adeshon se nirnay or jivan ke liye ek adarsh namoona prastut karata he
 In the same way, there are many more
 khud koran main he ki allaah kii rassi ko majbuti se pakad lo
 There is no conflict between any faction of Muslims on the basis of the Quran
 koran kaa haq koran ke har musalmaan par paanch haq hai, jo use apni shakti or samarthy ke anusaar purna karnaa chahie
 To understand the Quran, it is important to know the background of its incarnation
 yah is tarah kii kitaab nahin he ki ise puraa likh kar pigambar ko dekar kah diya gaya ho ki jaao isaki ore logon ko bulaao
 Rather, on the occasion of the Quran, which was started by Arab Muhammad in Arabia, the Qur'an was descended according to necessity
 aarambh se jaise hi koran kaa kuch bhaag avatarit hota aap use likhva dete or yah bhi bataa dete ki yah kiske saath padhaa jayega
 In order of incarnation, scholars have divided the Quran into two parts
 ek makki bhaag, doosraa madani bhaag
 Initially, there were minor appearances in maize
 unki bhashaa shreshth, prabhavi or arabon kii pasand ke anusaar shreshth saahitiyik darje vaali thi
 His words used to fall in the heart
 uske daivie sangeet se kaan usko sunne main lag jate or uske daivie prakaash se log aakarshith ho jate yaa ghabara jate
 It described the laws of creation on which human wonder is still astonishing after centuries, but all examples were local for this
 unheen ke itihaas, unhi kaa maahaul
 This went on for five years
 iske baad makke kii rajnatik tathaa aarthik satta par qabze vaale logon ne apane liye is khatre ko bhaanp kaa zulm va jyaadati kaa vah tandav kiya ki musalamaanon kii jo thodi sankhya thi usamen bhi kai logon ko gharbaar chhod kar habsha janaa padaa
 The prophet himself had to be imprisoned with all the family members in a valley and eventually left Mecca and went to Medina
 musalamaanon par yah bada sakht samay tha or allaah ne is samay jo koran nazil kiya usamen talwaar kii kaat or baadh kii tezi thi
 Which shook the entire area
 musalamaanon ke liye tasalli or is kathin samay main kii jane vaali prarthanaaain hai jo is aath varsh ke koran kaa mukhya bhaag raheen
 It is clear from this violent episode that the influence of human creativity and emotions was in the composition of this book
 makki daur ke teraa varsh baad madeene main musalamaanon ko ek kendra praapt ho gaya
 Where all the believers gathered and the incarnation of the third round began
 yahan musalamaanon kaa do nae prakaar ke logon se parichay hua
 The first Jews who had been inhabited here for centuries and according to their religious faith were waiting for the last prophet
 kintu antim nabi ko unhone apane atirikt duusari qaom main dekha to utpaat machaa diya
 During this period in the Quran, strict comments were made in the Quran on the book Ahle
 isi yug main kutachariyon kaa ek gut musalamaanon main paidaa ho gaya jo musalmaan hone kaa naatak karte or virodhiyon se mili rahat It was here that the Muslims got the permission for the armed struggle and they had to constantly face the attacks of the Meccans
 duusari ore ek islamic rajya kii sthapana ke saath puure samaaj kii rachana ke liye ishwariya niyam avatarit hue
 War, peace, justice, social customs and food, God's command of all are characteristic of the Qur'an of this era
 jinke aadhaar par samaajik barabari kaa ek adarsh rajya allaah ke rasul ne khadaa kar diya
 On the basis of this, even today, the order of Hazrat Muhammad is considered to be the first among the world heroes
 unhone jivan ke har kshaitra main zabaani nirdesh nahin die, balki us par amal karke dikhaaya
 Due to this background, the same thing has to be repeated many times in the Quran
 akeshwarwad, dharmik aadesh, swarg, narak, sabar , dharm parayanata ke vishay hai jo baar baar dohraye gaye
 The Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years the pursuit of this civilization on the whole world cannot be rescued
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 a few years ago, a group of Arabs collected verses from the Qur'an relating to the scriptures and translated them into English, Prof
 Presented to Dr
 Keith Moore, Professor of Embryology and Head of the University of Toronto
 is samay vishwa main bhrun shaastra ke sarvocch gyaata maane jate hai
 They were asked to present their views on the verses related to embryology in the Quran
 unhone unka adhyayan karne ke pashchaat kaha ki bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main koran main varnan thik aadhunik khojon ke anuroop hai
 Regarding some verses, he said that he cannot call it wrong or right because he himself is unaware of it
 isamen sabase pehle nazil kii gai koran kii vah aayat bhi shaamil thi jiskaa anuwaad he
 Take the name of your family and study, who created it
 jisane insaan ko khun kii footki se banaaya
 In this, a word has been used in Arabic language, it has one meaning of blood foot and the other means like leech
 dow
 moore ko us samay tak yah gyaat nahin tha ki kya mata ke garbh main aarambh main bhrun kii surat jonk kii tarah hoti he
 He conducted his experiments on this and after study said that initially in the mother's womb, the fetus is in the shape of leech
 dow kith moore ne bhrun shaastra ke sambandh main 80 prashnon ke uttar die jo koran or haddees main varnit hai
 In the same way, there are many more
 unhi ke shabdon main, yadi 30 varsh purv mujhase yah prashn puche jate to main inamen aadhe bhi uttar nahin de paata
 Because till then science had not made so much progress in this area
 In 1981, at the Saudi Medical Conference, Dr
 Moore announced that he had come to believe that Hazrat Muhammad was a prophet of God by looking at the verses of the Qur'an's embryology
 kyon ki sadiyon purv jab vigyaan khud bhrun avasthaa main ho itani sateek baaten keval ishwar hi kah saktaa he
 Dr
 Moore has included everything in the 1982 edition of his book which is available in many languages and is taught to first-year medical students
 is kitaab ko kisi ek vyakti dwaara chikitsa shaastra ke kshaitra main likhi kitaab kaa award bhi mil chukaa he
 There are hundreds of examples that you will read continuously in this commentary of the Quran
 mat bhinnata ek etraz kiya jaataa he ki jab koran itani sidhd kitaab he to uski tikaa main hazarat mohammad se ab tak vidwaanon main mat bhinnata kyon he
 Suffice it to say here that Prophet Muhammad promoted healthy discrimination among his followers, but you did not like bigotry and factionalism on the basis of differences
 sehatmand matbhinnata samaaj kii pragati main sadaiv sahaayak hoti he or gutbandi sadaiv nuqasaan pahunchaati he
 Therefore, the differences of Islamic scholars have also helped to work in the Qur'an hadith and in the creation of an ideal society, but the damage has been caused by factionalism by developing this differences in a radical way
 shabdic vahya koran hazarat mohammad par avatarit hua vah ishwariya shabdon main tha
 It is literal, not as meaning
 yah baat isliye spashth karnaa padi ki isai shikshan sansthaaon main yah shiksha di jaati he ki vahya ishwariya shabdon main nahin hoti balki nabi ke hriday par uskaa arth aata he jo vah apane shabdon main varnit kar detaa he
 This belief is important for Christians because they could tell the truth about the changes they made in the Bible
 puraa isai or yahudi vishwa sadiyon se yah prayaas kar rahaa he ki kisi prakaar yah sidhd kar de ki koran hazarat mohammad ke shabd hai or unki rachana he
 Many books have been written about this and efforts have been made to prove it in many ways but none have been able to achieve this success so far
 doordarshan yaa televijan ek aisi doorsanchaar pranali he jiske dwaara chalchitr va dhwani ko do sthanon ke bich prasaarit va praapt kiya ja sake
 The term is also used for Doordarshan sets, Doordarshan programs and broadcasts
 doordarshan kaa angreji shabd 'television' latin tathaa unani shabdon se banaaya gaya he jiskaa arth hota he dur drushti 
 Doordarshan sets have been available since the late 1930s and soon became common in homes and institutions as a source of news and entertainment
 1970 ke dashak se visiar tepe or iske vaad visidi va dividi jaise ankiy pranaaliyon ke dwaara ricard kiye kaarykram va cinema dekhnaa bhi sambhav ho gaya
 Doordarshan broadcasting in India began on 15 September 1959 when the Doordarshan Kendra was opened in Delhi as a pilot project and the government Doordarshan channel called Doordarshan was laid
 doordarshan main upgrah takanic kaa prayog 1975-1976 main prarambh hua
 The main divisions of Doordarshan are shown in the following figure

 yadi iskaa ilaaj na kiya gaya to, is beemaari ke parinamswaroop dard, daanton kii haani, sankraman or charam sthitiyon main mrityu tak ho sakati he
 Currently, dental caries remains the most common disease throughout the world
 danta-kshay ke adhyayan ko kshay-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 The presentation of caries may vary; However, risk factors and stages of development are similar
 prarambh main yah ek chote khadiamay kshetra ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he, jo antat ek bade chhidr ke rup main viksit ho jaataa he
 Occasionally, caries can be seen directly, although other methods of detection, such as radiographs, are used for less visible parts of the teeth and to assess the extent of damage
 dant-kshay amla-utpann karne vaale ek vishisht prakaar ke jeevanuon ke kaaran hota he, jo ki kinvan-yogya carbohydrates, jaise sukroj, fructose or glucose kii upasthiti main daanton ko kshati pahunchaate hai
 The mineral content of teeth is sensitive to the increase in acidity caused by lactic acid
 vishisht rup se, ek daant main daant va laar ke bich akhnijikaran or punarkhnijikaran kii ek satat prakriya chalati rahati he
 When the ph on the tooth surface drops below 5
5, demineralization begins to occur more rapidly than remineralization 
 iske parinamswaroop daant kaa ksharan hota he
 Depending on the extent of tooth erosion, various treatments can be performed to bring the tooth back to the proper shape, function and beauty, but no known method is available to recover a large amount of tooth structure, although the stem -sell related research points to one such method
 iske bajaay, danta swasthya sanghathan danta kshay se bachaav ke liye niyamit maukhik swatchta or aahaar main parivartan jaise nivarak or roganirodhak upayon kaa samarthan karte hai
 Dental caries can be classified on the basis of location, etiology, rate of growth, and hard tissue affected
 in vargikarnon kaa prayog danta-kshay ke kisi vishisht maamle kaa vivaran dene ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, taaki anya logon ko sthiti kii jaankaree adhik achookta ke saath di ja sake or saath hi daant ke ksharan kii gambhirtha kii ore suchit bhi kiya ja sake
 There are generally two types of damage when classified on the basis of condition: smooth surface damage and pits and cracks
 The location, growth, and range of damage on smooth surfaces is different from damage in pits and crevices
 ji
 ve
 blake ne ek vargeekaran pranali viksit kii, jiskaa prayog vyapak paimaane par kiya jaataa he or jo daant main ho rahe kshay kii sthiti par aadhaarit he
 In the original classification, dental caries were grouped into five groups, denoted by the word "range" and a Roman numeral
 gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaale kshay ko shrenee i ke rup main suchit kiya jaataa he; chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati ko aage shrenee II, shrenee III, shrenee IV va shrenee v main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 a category VI was also added to Blake's classification of dental caries and also represents damage on smooth surfaces
 gadde va daraaren daant par sthit sanrachanaatmak chihn hai, jahaan se dantabalk bheetar kii ore mudata he
 The cracks are formed during the development of the grooves, but the enamel at that location is not fully connected
 iske parinamswaroop, dantabalk kii sataha kii sanrachana par ek gaharaa rekhiy gaddha ban jaataa he, jo danta-kshay ko viksit hone va panpane ke liye ek sthaan pradaan karata he
 The cracks are mostly located on the occlusal surface of the posterior teeth and on the palatal surface of the anterior teeth located on the lath
 gadde chote, sui kii nok ke aakaar ke chhidr hote hai, jo adhikanshtah khaanchon ke chor yaa anuprastha bhaag par paae jate hai
 Typically, cupola pits are found on the outer surfaces of molars
 sabhi prakaar ke gaddhon va daraaron ke liye atyadhik gaharaai tak muda hua dantabalk in satahon par maukhik swasthya kaa dhyaan rakh paanaa kathin bana detaa he, jiske kaaran in kshetron main danta-kshati viksit hona adhik aam he
 The occlusal layer of teeth constitutes 12
5% of the total tooth layer, but more than 50% of the total dental damage is found on them
 kul danta-kshayon kaa 90% bacchon ke daanton ke gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaali kshatiyaan hoti hai
 It can sometimes be difficult to identify erosion in pits and crevices
 jaise-jaise ksharan main vruddhi hoti jaati he, daant kii sataha ke sabase paas sthit dantabalk kaa kshay kramshah gaharaai main failane lagata he
 Once this caries reaches the dentin of the dentin and enamel, the erosion spreads laterally
 dant-utak ke bheetar, yah ksharan ek tribhuj pattern kaa paalan karata he, jisaki disha daant ke goode kii ore hoti he
 This pattern of corrosion is uniquely described by two triangles whose bases are connected to each other on the DEJ
 chikani sataha par hone vaale ksharan ke vipareet aadhaar-se-aadhaar kaa yah pattern ek gadde va daraar ke ksharan kaa vishisht pattern he
 There are three types of erosion that occur on a smooth surface
 samipsth ksharan, jise antahsamipsth ksharan bhi kaha jaataa he, samipsth daanton ke bich kii chikani sataha par hota he
 Basic caries occurs on the root surfaces of teeth
 chikani sataha par hone vaala tisare prakaar kaa ksharan daant kii kisi bhi anya chikani sataha par hota he
 Proximal caries are the most difficult to identify
 aksar is prakaar ke ksharan kii pahchaan keval dekhakar yaa danta anveshak ke dwaara maanviya rup se nahin kii ja sakati
 samipsth ksharan do daanton ke sampark-sthal ke thik neeche grav rup se nirmit hota he
 As a result, a radiograph is required to identify proximal caries at an early stage
 blake kii vargeekaran pranali main, pichley daanton par utpann samipsth ksharan shrenee II ke ksharan kehalaate hai
 Proximal caries on the front teeth, if not involving the rodent end, is placed in category III and if the rodent end is involved, it is placed in category IV
 mul ksharan, jinka varnan kabhi-kabhi chikani-sataha vaale ksharan ke ek prakaar ke rup main kiya jaataa he, ksharan kaa teesraa sabase aam prakaar hai or ye saamanytah tab utpann hote hai, jab mul satahen masoodon main ghataav ke kaaran ujagar ho gayi hon
 yadi masoode swasth hon, to mul ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin hoti kyonki jeevanvik plak mul satahon tak nahin pahunch saktaa
 dantabalk kii tulana main mul satahen akhanijeekaran prakriya ke prati adhik asurakshit hoti hai kyonki dant-mul 6
7 piech par akhanijeekrut hona prarambh karata he, jo ki dantabalk ke najuk piech se ucch he
 Despite this, it is easier to prevent the development of root caries than enamel erosion because reabsorption of fluoride is greater in the original than enamel
 antahsamipsth satahon kii tulana main, jiheey satahon kii tulana main jihviy satahon par mul ksharan hone kii sambhaavna sabase zyada hoti he
 The jaw teeth on the jaw are the most common place of original caries, followed by the jaw on the jaw, the forearm on the jaw, the posterior position on the jaw and the teeth on the jaw
 daanton kii chikani satahon par chot lag janaa bhi sambhav he
 Since they occur in all areas of the smooth surface except for interconnected areas, it is easy to identify this type of corrosion and is associated with food that encourages plaque and caries formation
 blake ke vargeekaran ke antargat, ananmukheey athwa jiheey satahon ke paas sthit masoodon par hone vaale ksharan ko shrenee v ke rup main chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Category VI is reserved for the ends of the posterior teeth and the rodent ends of the anterior teeth
 purv varnit do shreniyon ke alaava, ksharangrast chot ko ek daant kii kisi vishisht sataha par unki sthiti ke dwaara bhi varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 The erosion that occurs on the surface of the teeth closest to the cheeks or lips is called "caries erosion" and the surface erosion on the side of the tongue is called gingival erosion
 ananmukh ksharan ko aage kapol or oshthak kaha jaataa he
 Obstructive caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the posterior teeth
 krintak ksharan agrastha daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paaya jaataa he
 Erosions can also be described as "moderate" or "remote"
 madhyam ksharan daanton par kisi aise sthaan se sambandhit hote hai, jo chehre kii madhya-rekha ke nikat ho, jo ki ankhon ke bich se neeche naak kii ore or madhya krintakon ke sampark ke bich kii urdhv dhuree par sthit hoti he
 The position of the teeth distal to the midline is described as distal
 kuch udaahranon main, kshayon kaa varnan kisi anya prakaar se bhi kiya jaataa he, jo iske kaaran kii ore suchit karata ho
 "baby bottle erosion", "early childhood caries" or "baby bottle tooth erosion" is a pattern found in young children with temporary teeth
 isamen jabadon ke agr-bhaag par sthit daanton par sabase zyada prabhaav padane kii sambhaavna hoti he, lekin sabhi daant prabhavit ho sakate hai
 This type of caries gets its name based on the fact that this caries usually occurs as a result of allowing infants to sleep with the sweet liquids stored in their bottles, or to feed infants several times a day
 ksharan kaa ek anya pattern “atyadhik failanevaala ksharan " he, jo anek daanton kii kai satahon par hone vaale unnat yaa atyadhik ksharan ko suchit karata he
 Excessive spreading erosion can be seen in people suffering from dry mouth disease, disregard for mouth health, use of stimulants and / or consuming sugar too much
 yadi atyadhik failanevaala ksharan sir va gardan par purvavarti vikiran ke kaaran ho, to iskaa varnan vikiran-prabhavit ksharan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 These problems can occur due to autoimmune of the original and when new teeth are growing, reconstruction of the entire tooth or later for unknown reasons
 dow miller ne 1887 main kaha ki "danta-ksharan ek rasinic-paraseete prakriya he, jisamen do charan hote hai-dantabalk kaa akhatikaran, jiske parinamswaroop purna vinaash hota he, tathaa praathmik charan ke rup main dant-utak kaa akhatikaran, jiske baad mulaayam ho chukaa avshisht kaa vilyan hota he
 "in his hypothesis, Dr
 Miller assigned the necessary roles to three factors: ksharanon kii pragati kii dar va pichley itihaas kii ore suchit karne ke liye un par asthaayee vivaran lagu kiye ja sakate hai
 "acute" refers to a rapidly developing condition, while "long-term" describes a condition that has taken too long to develop, including thousands of bars of food and breakfast, of which Many cause some acid demineralization, which is not re-mineralized, eventually resulting in pores
 fluoride upachaar daant ke dantabalk punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Recurring caries, also known as secondary caries, are caries that occur at a location that has a long history of erosion
 aksar yah bharaai or anya danta prayaavartanon par paaya jaataa he
 Early erosion, on the other hand, is used to describe a decay at a place that has not experienced any decay before
 roka gaya ksharan kisi aise daant par ek chot kaa varnan karata he, jo pehle akhanijeekrut ho gaya ho, lekin jise koi chhidr utapann hone se pehle hi punarkhanijeekrut kar liya gaya ho
 Using fluoride treatment can be helpful in recalibration
 prabhavit hone vaale utakon ke aadhaar par, ksharanon kaa varnan dantabalk, dant-utak yaa dant-mul rakhane vaale ksharanon ke rup main kiya janaa sambhav he
 At the beginning of its development, caries is only possible to affect enamel
 ek baar jab kshay kaa vistaar dant-utak kii gahari parat tak pahunch jaataa he, to “dant-utak ksharan” shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since cementum is a hard tissue covering the roots of teeth, it is generally not affected by caries until the roots of the tooth are exposed in the mouth
 Although the term "dental caries" can be used to describe caries at the roots of teeth, in very rare situations this erosion only affects the tooth root
 jadon main dant-utak kii ek badi parat ke upar cementem kii ek bahut patali parat hoti he or is prakaar dant-mul ko prabhavit karne vaale adhikansh ksharan dant-utak ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 It is possible that a person experiencing erosion may not be aware of it
 ek nae ksharangrast ghaav kaa sabase pehla sanket daant kii sataha par ek khadiamay safed dhabbe ke rup main miltaa he, jo is baat kii ore suchit karata he ki us kshetra main dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran ho rahaa he
 This is called initial decay
 jab ghaav kaa akhanijeekaran jari rahata he, to yah bhure rang main badal saktaa he, lekin antat yah ek kotkh main badal jayega
 chhidr kaa nirmaan hone se pehle, yah prakriya prativerti hoti he, lekin ek baar chhidr kaa nirmaan ho jane par, daant kii nasht ho chuki sanrachana ko punarutpann nahin kiya ja saktaa
 koi aisa ghaav jo bhure rang or chamkila kaa dikhaai detaa ho, yah darshata he ki kisi samay danta ksharan maujuud the, lekin akhanijeekaran kii prakriya ruk gai he or keval ek daag rah gaya he
 a brownish stain that appears to be dull is probably a sign of active corrosion
 jab dantabalk or dant-utak nasht ho jate hai, to yah chhidr lakshaneey ho jaataa he
 The affected areas of the tooth change their color and feel soft on touching
 ek baar jab kshay dantabalk se hokar guzar jaataa he, to daanton kii nalikaayen, jinamein daant kii nason tak jane kaa maarg hota he, ujagar ho jaati hai, jisase daant main dard hone lagata he
 This pain may increase further when exposed to hot, cold or sweet food and drinks
 danta-kshay ke kaaran saanson main badboo or vikrut swaad jaisi samasyaayein bhi ho sakati hai
 In highly developed conditions, tooth infection can also spread to the surrounding soft tissue
 guhamay vivar dhanasrata or ludbig kaa kanthshul jaisi jatiltaaon se jivan ke liye khatra bhi utpann ho saktaa he
 Four main parameters are required for the formation of an erosion: the tooth surface; Caries-causing bacteria; Fermentable carbohydrates; and time
 The caries process has no inevitable consequence and different individuals are sensitive to different categories based on the size of their teeth, oral health habits, and their salivary resistance
 danta ksharan daant kii kisi bhi aisi sataha par ho saktaa he, jo ki munh ke chhidr main ujagar ho rahi ho, lekin yah asthi ke bheetar bachaa lee gai sanrachana par nahin ho saktaa
 There are some specific diseases and deformities affecting the teeth, due to which the risk of erosion can increase in a person
 amelogenesis imperfecta, jo 718 main se 1 or 14,000 main se ek vyakti ke bich hota he, ek aisa rog he, jisamen dantabalk yaa to puri tarah nirmit hi nahin hota yaa aparyaapt maatra main nirmit hota he or daanton se gir saktaa he
 In both cases, the risk of tooth decay may increase because enamel is not able to protect the tooth
 adhikansh vyaktiyon main, danta ksharan kaa praathmik kaaran daanton ko prabhavit karanevaali vikrutiyaan yaa bimaariyaan nahin hotin
 daant ke dantabalk kaa chhiyanbe pratishat bhaag khanijon se milakar bana hota he
 These minerals, especially hydroxyapatite, will become soluble when exposed to acidic environments
 Demineralization of enamel begins at a ph of 5
5
 dantabalk kii tulana main dant-utak va dant-mul main ksharan kaa khatra adhik hota he kyonki unamem khanij kii maatra kam hoti he
 Thus, caries can develop quickly when the root surfaces of a tooth are encountered with gums or other diseases associated with the gums
 haalanki, ek swasth maukhik vaataavaran main bhi daant main danta-ksharan hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 The structure of teeth can affect the likelihood of caries formation
 jahaan daanton ke gahare khaanche adhik sankhya main tathaa atiranjit hote hai, vahaan gaddhon va daraaron ke vikaas kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 Also, if food particles are buried between the teeth, the chances of corrosion increase
 hamaare munh main anek prakaar ke maukhik jeevanu paye jate hai, lekin aisa mana jaataa he ki un jeevanuon kii keval kuch vishisht prajatiyaan hi dant-kshay ke liye uttaradaayi hoti hai, jinamein strepstococas mutans or lactobacili shaamil hai
 Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus, Nocardia spp
 And Streptococcus mutans have a close association with dental caries, especially dental caries
 daaton or masoodon ke aas-paas jeevanu ek chipchipe, malai-jaise rang ke padaarth main jamaa ho jate hai, jise plak kaha jaataa he, jo ek jaev-aavaran ke rup main kaary karata he
 Plaque aggregation at some specific locations is more common than at other locations
 daaton ke bich sampark bindu kii hi tarah charvnak or agracharvanak daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paae jane vaale khaanche bhi sookshmdarsheey avarodhan pradaan karte hai
 Plaque may also collect on the gums
 kisi vyakti ke munh main upasthit jeevanu glucose, fructose or sabase aam taur par sukroj ko kinvan naamak ek glicolitic prakriya ke dwaara lactic amla aadi jaise amlon main parivartit kar dete hai
 If these acids are left in contact with the tooth, they can cause demineralization, which is the process of dissolution of minerals
 haalanki yah prakriya gatij hoti he kyonki yadi laar yaa mouthwash ke dwaara is amla ko niskriy kar diya jaae, to punarkhanijeekaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish can be helpful in remineralization
 yadi akhanijeekaran lambey samay tak jari rahata he, to itani badi maatra main khanij-saamagree kii haani ho sakati he ki shesh rah gaya narm jaev padaarth vighatit ho jaataa he, jisase ek kotor yaa chhidr ban jaataa he
 The effect exerted by such sugars on the development of dental caries is called caries
 yadhyapi sharkara ek baddh glucose va fructose ikai hoti he, lekin vastav main yah glucose or fructose kii samaan maatra ke mishran kii tulana main adhik ksharankari hoti he
 This is because bacteria derive energy from the bond between the glucose and fructose subunits
 enzim dextransukraanez dwaara sukroj ko dexran policecride naamak ek atyadhik chipchipe padaarth main roopantarit karke es
 mutans daant par sthiti jaev-parat se chipka rahata he
 The potential for caries development is also affected by the frequency at which teeth are exposed to caries environments
 bhojan athwa naashte ke baad, munh main upasthit jeevanu sharkara kaa chayapachay karte hai, jiske parinamswaroop piech ko ghataane vaale ek amleey-upotpaada kaa nirmaan hota he
 Over time, ph returns to normal due to the salivary resistance and the dissolved mineral content of the tooth surface
 amleey vaataavaran ke saath hone vaale prayek sampark ke dauraan, daanton kii sataha par upasthit gaiyr-jaivik padaarth kaa kuch bhaag vighatit ho jaataa he or yah do ghanton tak vighatit bana rah saktaa he
 Since there is a risk of tooth erosion during these acidic periods, the development of dental caries is highly dependent on the frequency of acidic contact
 yadi bhojan main upyukt carbohydrate kii paryaapt maatra ho, to yah ksharan prakriya munh main daant ke ugane ke kuch hi dinon ke bheetar prarambh ho sakati he
 Evidence suggests that fluoride treatments slow down this process
 samipsth ksharan ko kisi sthaayee daant ke dantabalk se hokar guzarane main ausatan chaar varshon kaa samay lagata he
 Since the enamel covering the original surface is not as durable as the enamel covering the original head, the original erosion generally increases faster than caries on other surfaces
 mul ksharan par hone vaala yah vikaas or khanijeekaran kii haani dantabalk par hone vaale ksharan kii tulana main 2
5 guna adhik tej hoti he
 In very severe cases, in which oral health is very poor and the amount of fermentable carbohydrate in the food is high, erosion can occur within a few months of tooth eruption due to erosion
 udaahranarth, yadi bachche lagaataar shishu botalon se sharkarayukta peya kaa seven karte hon, to aisa ho saktaa he
 There is a correlation between a decrease in saliva and an increase in corrosion because the immunity of saliva is not present to balance the acidic environment created by certain foods
 As a result, the medical conditions that reduce the amount of saliva produced by the salivary glands, especially the jaw subsystem and the parotid gland, are likely to cause extensive dental caries
 iske udaahranon main szograine syndrome, diabetes melitas, diabetes insipids tathaa sarcidosis shaamil hai
 Antihistamines and antidepressants can also block salivary flow
 utprerak, sarvaadhik kukhyat rup se methilamphetamine, bhi laar ke pravaah ko bahut adhik avaruddh kar dete hai
 The tendency of bad oral health is found in those who abuse the catalysts
 bhaang ke paudhe main paaya jane vaala sakriy rasinic padaarth, tetrahydrokaenabinol, bhi laar ke pravaah ko lagbhag puri tarah roak detaa he or is sthiti ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main “coton mouth " kehete hai
 Together with the excessive intake of sugary drinks and unrefined foods, it greatly increases the extent of caries in the users of cannabis
 iske atirikt, sanyukt rajya america main sabase aamtaur par di jane vaali dawaaon main se tirasth pratishat main inke gyaat dushprabhavon kii suchi main munh ke sookhne kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Radiation treatment of the head and neck can also affect cells located in the salivary gland, increasing the likelihood of caries formation
 tambaakoo kaa prayog kii ksharan ke nirmaan ke jokhim ko badha saktaa he
 Some brands of smokeless tobacco have high sugar levels, increasing the chance of caries
 tambaakoo kaa prayog daanton se sambandhit un bimariyon ke liye ek mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak hota he, jo masoode ko peeche dhakel detii hai
 When the gingiva is attached to the teeth, the root surface becomes more visible in the mouth
 yadi aisa hota he, to mul ksharan ek chintajanak baat hoti he kyonki daanton ko dhankane vaale dant-mul ko amlon dwaara dantabalk kii tulana main adhik saralata ke saath akhanijeekrut kar diya jaataa he
 Currently, there is not enough evidence to support an informal relationship between smoking and spinal caries, but these evidence do point to an association between smoking and root-surface caries
 antargarbhashayi or navjaat shishuon main sise kaa sampark danta kshay ko protsaahit karata he
 In addition to lead, electric charge and all molecules with the same ionic radius of divalent calcium, such as cadmium, mimic calcium ions, and therefore contact with them increases tooth decay
 dantabalk atyadhik khanijeekrut akoshikeey utak hota he or ksharan jeevanuon dwaara prarambh kii jane vaali ek rasinic prakriya ke dwaara ise haani pahunchaate hai
 When these bacteria start consuming sugars and use it for their own energy, then they produce lactic acid
 is prakriya ke prabhaavon main dantabalk main upasthit kanon kaa akhanijeekaran shaamil he, jo ki samay ke bitne ke saath-saath amlon ke kaaran hota he or tab tak jari rahata he, jab tak ki jeevanu shaareerik rup se dant-utak ko bhed na len
 dantabalk kii chaden, jo ki dantabalk kii sanrachana kii moolbhoot ikaiyaan hoti hai, daant kii sataha se dant-utak tak lambavat sthit hoti hai
 Since demineralization of enamel through erosion usually occurs in the direction of enamel rods, different triangular patterns and smooth-surfaced caries develop between the pits and pores in enamel that two areas of tooth enamel rods The situation varies
 jab dantabalk apane khanijon ko kho detaa he or danta ksharan kaa vikaas hone lagata he, to dantabalk main anek spasht kshetra viksit ho jate hai, jinhen ek prakaash sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dekha ja saktaa he
 From the deepest layer of enamel to the enamel surface, the areas identified are: translucent area, black area, body of wound, and surface area
 parbhasi kshetra ksharan kaa pehla drishy sanket hota he or yah khanijon kii ek se do pratishat haani hone par banataa he
 There is little remineralization of enamel in the black zone, which provides an example of how the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes
 sarvaadhik akhanijeekaran va vinaash kaa kshetra swatah ghaav kaa mukhya bhaag hi hota he
 The surface area remains relatively mineral-rich and remains present until the tooth structure changes to a pore
 dantabalk ke vipareet, dant-utak danta kshay kii pragati ke prati pratikriya detaa he
 After the creation of the tooth, the aminoblasts that produce enamel are destroyed when the enamel is completed and therefore they cannot be reconstructed after enamel is destroyed
 On the other hand, dentin is produced by the odontoblast throughout its lifespan, which lies between the pulp and dentin
 chunki, odontoblast upasthit hote hai, atah ek utprerak, jaise ksharan, ek jaivik pratikriya ko prarambh kar saktaa he
 These safety procedures include the formation of whiteboard and tertiary dentin
 sabase gahari parat se dantabalk tak sthit dant-utak main, ksharan dwaara prabhavit hone vaale kshetra parbhasi kshetra, vinaash kaa kshetra tathaa jeevanivik chhedan kaa kshetra hai
 The translucent zone represents a moving list of damage processes and is located where the initial demineralization begins
 jeevanvik chhedan tathaa vinaash ke kshetra akramanakari jeevanuon tathaa antat dant-utak ke vighatan ke kshetra hai
 The structure of dentin is an arrangement of microscopic currents, called dentinal tubules, that protrude from the pulp part toward the outer dentin or enamel border
 dant-utak nalikaaon kaa vyas goode ke paas adhik or dant-utak va dantabalk ke sangyojan-sthaan par sabase kam hota he
 The damage process continues throughout the dentin tubules, which are responsible for the triangular pattern resulting from the development of caries deep into the tooth
 nalikaayen ksharanon ko bhi tezi se viksit hone kaa mauka detii hai
 In response, the fluid present in the tubes brings immunoglobulin from our immune system to fight this bacterial infection
 isi samay, aas-paas kii nalikaaon ke khanijeekaran main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he
 This results in the formation of tubules, an attempt to reduce the rate of bacterial progression
 iske atirikt, jab jeevanuon kaa amla hydroxipetic kanon kaa akhanijeekaran karata he, to calcium va phosphorus chode jate hai, jisase adhik sankhya main kanon ke avakshepan kaa mauka miltaa he, jo dant-utak nalikaaon main gahare tak samaa jate hai
 These particles form a barrier and slow the expansion of corrosion
 in rakshaatmak pratikriyaaon ke baad, dant-utak ko shwetapatli mana jaataa he
 It is believed that due to the fluids present inside the tubules of dentin, the pain receptors located inside the tooth pulp become active
 chunki shwetapatli dant-utak aise dravon ke pravaah ko roktaa he, atah sambhav he ki jis dard ne jeevanuon ke akraman kii chetavanee di hoti, vah pehle pahal utpann hi na ho
 As a result, dental caries may continue to progress for a long time without any sensitivity to the tooth, which can lead to great loss of tooth structure
 danta kshay kii pratikriyaswaroop, goode kii disha main or adhik dant-utak kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 This new dentin is referred to as tertiary dentin
 tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan aage bad rahe jeevanuon se goode kii yathasambhav raksha karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 When more tertiary dentin is produced, the size of the pulp decreases
 is prakaar ke dant-utak ko mul odontoblast kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti ke anusaar up-vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 If odontoblasts survive for so long that they can respond to dental caries, the dentin produced in this condition is called "reactive" dentin
 yadi odontoblast nasht ho jate hai, to is sthiti main utpann dant-utak ko “sudhaarak " dant-utak kehete hai
 In the case of rectal dentin, other tissues are required to play the role of destroyed odontoblasts
 aisa mana jaataa he ki vikaas kaarak, visheshtah tijief-beta, goode ke fibroblast or messentimal utakon ke dwaara sudhaarak dant-utak kaa nirmaan prarambh karte hai
 Corrective dentin is developed at an average rate of 1
5 μm / day, but can be increased to 3
5 μm / day
 parinamit dant-utak main aniyamit aakaar vaali dant-utak nalikaayen hoti hai or sambhav he ki ve pehle se maujuud dant-utak nalikaaon ke saath panktibaddh na hon
 yah dant-utak nalikaaon ke bheetar aage bad paane kii danta kshay kii kshamta ko gata detaa he
 The primary diagnosis involves inspecting all visible surfaces of the tooth with the help of a good source of light, dental mirror and investigator
 danta radiograph danta ksharan, visheshtah daanton ke bich sthit ksharan, ko kisi anya prakaar se darshneey hone se purv hi dikhaa saktaa he
 Large dental caries can often be seen with the naked eye, but small lesions can be difficult to detect
 danta-chikitsakon dwaara, vishisht rup se gaddhon va chhidron ke ksharan kaa pataa lagane ke liye, radiograph ke saath hi drishy or sparsh-dwaara nirikshan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Initial, infiltration erosion is often identified by blowing air across the suspect area, which removes moisture and alters the optical characteristics of unmetabolized enamel
 kuch danta anusandhankartaaon ne ksharan kii khoj karne ke liye danta anveshakon kaa prayog na karne kii chetavanee di he
 In situations where a small part of the tooth has started demineralization but has not yet produced a perforation, the pressure from the dental investigator may cause the perforation to form
 chunki, chhidr ke nirmaan se purv kshati kii prakriya ko rokkar lautaaya ja saktaa he, atah fluoride ke saath ksharan ko rokna va daant kii sataha ko punarkhanijeekrut karnaa sambhav ho saktaa he
 When a hole is present, restoration will be required to replace the lost tooth structure
 anek baar, gaddhon va chhidron ke ksharanon kii pahchaan karnaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Bacteria can penetrate enamel to reach dentin, but then the outer surface can be regenerated, especially if fluoride is present
 ye ksharan, jinhen kabhi-kabhi “chhipe hue ksharan ” kaha jaataa he, iske baavjood bhi eks-re radiograph dwaara dekhe ja sakenge, lekin daant kaa drishy pareekshan yah darshayega ki dantabalk avikal he athwa nunatam chhidrit he
 The damaged tooth structure is not completely reconstructed, although remineralization of very small damaged wounds may be possible if hygiene is maintained at its optimum level
 chote ghaavon ke liye, kabhi-kabhi samayik fluoride kaa prayog punarkhanijeekaran ko protsaahit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 For larger wounds, the progression of dental caries can be prevented by treatment
 upachaar kaa lakshya daant kii sanrachana ko banaae rakhana or daant ke or adhik vinaash ko rokna hota he
 Generally, early treatment is less painful and less expensive than late treatment
 asamvedak —sthaneey, nitras oxide "), athwa anya anushansit dawaaen— upachaar ke dauraan yaa iske baad dard ko kam karne athwa upachaar ke dauraan bechaini se raahat dene ke liye aavashyak ho sakati hai
 a dental handpiece is used to remove large parts of the damaged substance from the teeth
 ek chammach ek danta upkaran hota he, jiskaa prayog saavdhaneepurvak ksharan ko nikaalane ke liye kiya jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he, jab dant-utak main ho rahaa ksharan goode ke paas tak pahunch jaae
 ek baar ksharan ko hataa diye jane par, daant kii kho chuki sanrachana ko kisi prakaar kii danta punarsthapana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki daant ko punah isaki kaaryaatmakataa va suruchipurna sthiti par waapas laayaa ja sake
 Restorative materials include dental amalgam, composite resin, ceramic and gold
 mishrit raal va chini-mitti ko is prakaar banaaya ja saktaa he ki ve mariz ke daanton ke prakritik rang ke samaan dikhaai den or isaliye jab soundarya ek chintaa kaa vishay ho, to aksar inkaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Mixed restorations are not as strong as dental amalgam or gold; Some dentists consider swarna to be the only recommended restore for the rear teeth, which have too much chewing force
 jab ksharan bahut adhik vyapak ho, to yah sambhav he ki daant kii sanrachana main paryaapt rup se itnaa sthaan na ho ki punarsthapanaatmak padaarth ko daant ke bheetar rakhaa ja sake
 Hence a vertex may be required

 a dometer or galvanometer is a type of ammeter
 yah kisi paripath main dhara kii upasthiti kaa pataa karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Often ampere, volt or ohm marks are not placed on it
 Current senstivity-cs-nab \ ksi unit of current senstivity is Radian / Ampiar There can be many types of photometer sparshajya dharamapi sabase saral or upyogi chalchumbak dharamapi he
 There is a circular coil of insulating copper wire on the vertical structure of an non-magnetic material
 kundali main praaia: 552 chakkar hote hai, jisamen 2, 50 or 500 chakkaron ke baad sanyojak pench lage rahete hai
 With their help, you can work with fewer or more rounds as needed
 vrittakar kundali ko urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore ghumaya ja saktaa he
 a magnetic needle rests on the vertical rivet at the center of the coil and a long indicator of aluminum perpendicular to the needle, which rotates along the needle on a horizontal circular scale and deflects the magnetic needle
 yah scale chaar chaturthaanshon main vibhajit rahata he or prayek chaturthaansh main 0 degree se 90 degree tak ke chihn hote hai
 When the magnetic needle is in the magnetic meridian, the indicator remains at zero degree
 dhara naapane ke purv dharamapi ke aadhaar ko kshaitij kar lete hai or kundali ke samtal ko ghumaakar chumbakeey yamyottar main le aate hai
 In this case, the magnetic needle boxes are positioned in a depressed position at the center of the coil and also see that both ends of the indicator are located at 0 ° - 0 °
 Now connect the two connective screws of the dielectric to the circuit
 In which the current flows
 urdhwadhar kundali main dhara ke pravaahit hote hi, ek chumbakeey kshetra utpann ho jaataa he, jo parthiv kshaitij chumbakeey kshetra se samakon banaata he
 Due to both of those magnetic fields, two opposing forces on the magnetic needle work
 sooyee vikshepit hokar aisi dasha main ruk jaati he jahaan donon balyugmon kaa ghurna baraabar hota he
 If the needle deflection is Q, the current value is determined by the following formula: arthath dharamapi main bahanevaali dhara vikshep kone ke sparshajya ke samaanupati hoti he
 The change of constant dielectric is called multiplier
 parivartan gunak ampiore main napa jaati he
 This is equivalent to an electric current that can produce a 45 degree deflection in the needle of a dielectric
 is prakaar kaa saral sparshajya dharamapi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi or yatharth nahin hota
 Particularly due to the current, the intensity of the magnetic field is not the same at both poles of the magnetic needle
 is kaaran dharaman main truti ho jaati he, kyonki sutara isi par nirbhar he ki donon dhruvon par chumbakeey kshetra ek sa ho
 Therefore, based on this principle, a second thermometer was called, Helmholts galvanometer
 is dharamapi main yah truti nahin hoti or yah saral sparshajya dharamapi se adhik sookshmagrahi hota he
 It consists of circular coils on two vertical structures of non-magnetic material
 unke kendron ke bich kii duuri unke ardhavyas ke baraabar hoti he
 The magnetic needle box is placed exactly on the horizontal axis of both the coils
 donon kundaliyon ke taar is prakaar jod die jate hai ki jab unamem dhara pravaahit ho tab donon se utpann chumbakeey kshetra ek hi disha main hon
 In this case, the magnetic field produced by the ground near the magnetic needle becomes more intense and it can also be proved that the intensity of this field remains the same at both ends of the needle
 is parivartan ke falswaroop yah dharamapi adhik sookshmagrahi or yatharth ho jaataa he
 Before measuring the current, it is necessary to horizontal the plane of the needle box and the vertical coils in the magnetic meridian
 is samanjan ke baad jab dharamapi kii kundaliyon main dhara pravaahit kii jaati he or chumbakeey sooyee main kone kaa vikshep hota he, tab dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : g is called the change multiplier of Helmholt's photometer
 yah dharamapi bhi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi nahin hota
 a new theory is used to make more sensitive perforators
 vah yah he ki yadi parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav chumbakeey sooyee par kam kar diya jaae, to kisi bhi dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee main pehle se adhik vikshep hoga, arthath yantra adhik sookshmagrahi ho jayega
 This is called the principle of inertial pairing
 yadi do lagbhag baraabar chumbakeey ghurna vaale chumbakon ko ek drudh chad se aisa joda jaae ki ve ek duusare ke samaantar hon or unke vipareet dhruv paas paas hon, to unhen asthaitik yugma kehete hai
 In this pair, opposite poles of both magnets are close by, hence the effect of earth magnetic field has little effect on this pair
 taar kii kundali yaa kundaliyaan ek chumbak yaa donon chumbak ke chaaron ore is prakaar lapeti jaati hai ki unamem dhara bahane par chumbakon par ek hi disha main balyugma lage
 In this case if there is also a low current in the coil, there is more deflection in the magnetic pair
 is prakaar ke dharamapi ati sookshmagrahi hote hai
 If this magnetic pair is hung by a spindleless pendant and a small mirror is attached to this pendant, a very small deflection can be measured by the light beam
 prakaash kii kirane lamp se chalakar dharamapi ke darpan se paravartit hokar ek lens dwaara scale par focus main aati hai
 When there is a deflection in the magnetic pair due to current flow and the mirror rotates by angle Q, the reflected light rays rotate at angle 2Q and transfer to the lightpoint on the scale
 is vidhi se sooyee kaa ati sookshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he or iske falswaroop is dharamapi se ati sookshm dhara naapi ja sakati he
 The inertial magnetic pair has been used in many different types of currents
 kelvin dharamapi, pashen dharamapi or broka dharamapi inke kuch udhaaharan hai
 a current of 10-12 amperes can be measured from these currents
 jalchumbak dharamapi, vishesh kar asthaitik dharamapi, atyam sookshmagrahi hote hai, parantu inkaa prayog asuvidhajanak hota he
 They are also temporary
 yahi kaaran he ki ve bahut kam prayukt hote hai
 Most chalkandi dharampati is used, as they are permanent, simple and convenient in addition to being sufficiently sensitive

 The Chitpavans were Brahmins here, Narhari Bhave
 Mathematics lover and scientist
 He was interested in chemistry
 un dinon rangon ko baahar se aayaat karnaa padataa tha
 Narahari Bhave kept searching for colors night and day
 He was just a tune to make India self-sufficient in this matter
 unki mata rukmini bai vidhushi mahila thim
 Liberal-minded, all eight Yam were immersed in devotion
 It also affected their daily work
 man kahin ore rama hota to kabhi sabji main namak kam pad jaataa, kabhi zyada
 kabhi daal ke baghaar main hing daalana bhul jaatin to kabhi baghaar die bina hi daal paros di jaati
 puraa ghar bhakthi ras se sarabor rahata tha
 Therefore, no attention was paid to these small things
 usee satvik vaataavaran main 11 sitambar 1895 ko vinoba kaa janm hua
 His childhood name was Vinayak
 Mother used to call him affectionately as Vinya
 Apart from Vinoba, Rukmini Bai had two more sons: Valkoba and Shivaji
 Valkoba smaller than Vinayak
 Shivaji is the youngest
 The name Vinoba was given by Gandhiji
 maharashtra main naam ke peeche ‘ba’ lagane kaa jo chalan he, uske anusaar
 tucoba, vithoba or vinoba
 Vinayak's mother's nature was also found
 unka man bhi hameshaa aadhyatm chintan main leen rahata
 na unhen khaane-pine kii sud rahati thi
 Neither taste had a special identity
 maa jaisaa paros deteen, chupchaap kha lete
 rukmini bai kaa galaa bada hi madhur tha
 She would drown in listening to the hymn
 When she used to sing, she started to flow in full devotion in the whole environment
 They used to sing sweetly in the chants of Ramayana
 It seems like mother Sharda is lukewarm
 vinoba ko aadhyatm ke sanskaar dene, unhen bhakthi-vedant kii ore le jane main, bachapan main unke man main sanyas or vairaygy kii prerana jagaane main unki maa rukmini bai kaa bada yogadan tha
 The child Vinayak received the rites of both parents
 ganit kii sujh-boojh or tark-samathrya, vigyaan ke prati gahan anuraag, parampara ke prati vaigyanik drushtikon or tamaam tarah ke purvagrahon se alag hatakar sochane kii kala unhen pita kii ore se praapt hui
 While deep affection for religion and culture found by the mother, a sense of welfare of the living beings
 Positive attitude towards life, art of all religion, coexistence and respect
 Later Vinoba was considered as the spiritual heir of Gandhiji
 aaj bhi kuch log yahi kehete hai
 But this is a one-sided and one-sided analysis of Vinoba's character
 ve gandhi ji ke ‘aadhyatmik uttaradhikari’ se bahut aage, swatantra soch ke swami the
 The main thing is that Gandhi's brilliant halo could not be evaluated independently of his personality
 mahatma gandhi raajnneetik jeev the
 His spiritual consciousness was limited to the morning-evening aarti and worship
 jabaki unki dharmik-chetana unke raajnneetik kaaryakramon ke anukool or samanvyatmak thi
 There was no room for criticism and criticism
 dharm-darshan ke maamle main yun to vinoba bhi samarpan or sweekaarya-bhav rakhte the
 But whenever he got the opportunity, he explained the scriptures out of the box
 chaahe vah ‘gita pravachan’ hon yaa sant tukaraam ke abhangon par likhi gai pustak ‘santaprasad’
 isse usamen paryaapt moulikta or sahajata he
 This work could do only that which is free from anyone's intellectual halo
 ek baat yah bhi mahatma gandhi ke sanndhyi main aane se pehle hi vinoba aadhyatmik oonchai praapt kar chuke the
 Even after coming to the ashram, he used to take regular time for study and meditation
 vinoba se pehali hi mulaakaat main prabhavit hone par gandhi ji ne sahaj-man se kaha tha— Philosophy was his favorite subject
 ashram main daakhil hone ke kuch mahinon ke bheetar hi darshanashastra kii aage kii padhai ke liye unhone ek varsh kaa adhyayan avkaash liya tha
 Vinoba had two younger brothers like this, but Vinayak got the most of his mother
 bhaavnaatmak str par vinoba bhi khud ko apane pita kii apeksha maa ke adhik kareeb pate the
 The same situation was with Rukmini Bai, 'vinya' was the closest to his heart among the three sons
 ve bhajan-pujan ko samarpit rahati
 maa ke sanskaron kaa prabhaav
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon ke prati udaseenta or tyaag kii bhaavana kishoravastha main hi vinoba ke charitra kaa hissaa ban chuki thi
 The homeless corner would have made them more relaxed
 Silence would have made his conscience vocal
 He lived in the house, in the family among all, but such that even while living with everyone as if separate from him, clean and absolute
 Otherwise, to the mother, in her company
 'vinya' was much closer to his heart, his spiritual mind-building
 man ko koi uljhan ho to vahi sulajhane main madad karata
 koi aadhyatmik samasya ho to bhi vinya hi kaam aata
 yahaan tak ki yadi pati narhari bhaave bhi kuch kahen to usamen vinya kaa nirnay hi mahatvapurn hota tha
 It is not that Vinya was completely free or out of control
 parivaar kii aachaar samhita vinoba par bhi puri tarah lagu hoti thi
 Rather an incident of Vinoba's childhood
 rukmini bai ne bacchon ke liye ek niyam banaaya hua tha ki bhojan tulsi ke paughe ko pani dene ke baad hi milegaa
 vinya baahar se khelkar ghar pahunchate, bhukh se aakul-vyakul
 maa ke paas pahunchate hi kehete: Rukmini used to study the book 'das Bodh' of Samarth Guru Ramdas daily before sleeping
 Only then did she go to the bed
 It was only natural for the child to have this effect
 ve use sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev or shankaracharya kii kathaayen sunaatin
 ramayana, mahabharat kii kahaniyaan, upanishdon ke tatv gyaan ke bare main samajhaatin
 sanyas unki bhaawanaaon par savaar rahata
 lekin duniya se bhaagane ke bajaay logon se judane par ve jor deteen
 sansar se bhaagane ke bajaay usko badalane kaa aagrah karatin
 aksar kahatee—‘vinya, grihasthashram kaa bhalee-bhaanti paalan karne se pitaron ko mukti milti he
 'but on Vinya, the ghost of Guru Ramdas, Saint Dnyaneshwar and Shankaracharya used to ride
 All these Mahatmas boycotted their parents and family at a very young age for their spiritual fulfillment
 ve kehete— If there was another mother, she would have been shaken
 From the point of view, the sky would have lifted up on the head
 Because the general trend of people has become that renunciation, renunciation is a good thing, a matter of greatness, but only when renunciation and recluse are in the other's house
 Everyone wants to live a simple worldly life in their home
 magar rukmini bai to jaise kisi or hi mitti kii bani thim
 She lovingly explains to the son- betaa maa ke kahe ko aatmsaat karne kaa prayaas kar hi rahaa hota ki ve aage jod deteen- Vinoba was very intelligent in childhood
 Mathematics was his favorite subject
 kavita or aadhyatm chetana ke sanskaar maa se mili
 From them, the feeling of seeing both Root and Chetan with equal vision awakened
 Mother was very educated
 par unhone kii vinya ko aparigrah, astey ke bare main apane aacharan se bataaya
 While living in the world, taught him to be detached
 The mother's only effect was that Vinya would compose poetry and would burn them
 When everything in the world is temporary and fleeting, if nothing goes together then why should you be fascinated with your creation
 His mother would see all this, think, but say nothing
 As if she is preparing Vinya for the biggest sacrifice
 Vinoba's mathematical proficiency and his arguments were not hampered by his spiritual belief
 yadi kabhi donon ke bich spardhaa hoti bhi to jeet aadhyatmik vishwaas kii hi hoti
 aaj ve ghatnaayen maa-bete ke aapasi sneh-anuraag or vishwaas kaa aitihaasik dastavej hai
 Rukmini Bai used to donate one lakh grains of rice every month
 ek lakh kii ginati karnaa bhi aasaan na tha, so ve puure maheene ek-ek chaaval ginati rahati
 narhari bhaave patni ko chaaval ginate main shram karte dekh muskaraate
 kam umr main hi aankh kamjor pad jane se dar sataane lagata
 unki ganit buddhi kuch or hi kahati
 so ek din unhone rukmini bai ko tok hi diya—‘is tarah ek-ek chaaval ginaney main samay jaaya karne kii jarurat hi kya he
 Take a loaf of rice
 Count them Then take out the weight of one lakh rice from it and weigh it
 If there is no shortage, then put a few fists from above
 It was argued
 loukik samajhadaari bhi isi main thi ki jab bhi sambhav ho, duusare jaruri kaaryon ke liye samay kii bachat kii jaae
 rukmini bai ko pati kaa tark samaj to aata
 par man na maanata
 ek din unhone apni duvidha vinya ke saamne prakat karne ke baad poocha— The son heard everything, thought
 bolaa, ‘maa, pita ji ke tark main dam he
 This is what mathematics says
 kintu daan ke liye chaaval ginana sirf ginati karnaa nahin he
 While counting, we not only take the name of God with every rice, but our mind is also attached to it
 ’ ishwar ke naam par daan ke liye chaaval ginana bhi ek sadhana he, rukmini bai ne aisa pehle kahaan sochaa tha
 Rukmini Bai, who is fully immersed in Adhyatmarasas, liked the things of 'vinya'
 He used to be proud of his son
 He did not stop counting the rice even further
 Nor did his mind ever awaken to futility
 aisi hi ek or ghatana he
 Which shows how Vinoba Corey discovered metaphysics in mathematical calculations
 ghatana us samay kii he jab ve gandhi ji ke ashram main pravesh kar chuke the tathaa unke rachanaatmak kaaryon main bad-chadhakar hissaa le rahe the
 Prayer meetings take place in the ashram in the morning and evening
 The ashram dwellers who attend them are regularly counted
 This responsibility was a worker
 prasang yah he ki ek din prarthana sabha ke baad jab us kaaryakarta ne prarthana main upasthit hue aagantukon kii sankhya bataai to vinoba jhat se pratwaad karte hue bole— The worker believed in his count, so he too stood firm
 karm man vishwaas rakhane vaale vinoba aamtaur par bahes main padane se bachate the
 But on that day too, they were adamant
 ashram main vivaadon kaa niptaan baapu kii adaalat main hota tha
 Gandhiji believed in his worker
 magar jaanate the ki vinoba yun hi bahes main nahin padane vaale
 vaastaviktaa jaanane ke liye unhone vinoba kii ore dekha
 tab vinoba ne kaha—‘prarthana main sammilit shraddhaluon kii sankhya jitani inhone bataai usase ek kam hi thi
 ' 'how?' 'because a man's full attention was focused on counting the gentlemen present there
 ’ gandhiji vinoba kaa tark samaj gaye
 What is the need of accounts and appearances in the work of prayer
 Further, the work of counting the people who came to the prayer meeting was stopped
 yuvavastha ke praarambhik daur main hi vinoba aajanm brahmacharee rahane kii thaan chuke the
 The same great men were his ideals who had asceticism in childhood to seek truth
 or jab sanyas dhaaran kar brahmacharee bananaa he, grihasth jivan se naata hi todna he to kyon na man ko usee ke anuroop taiyaar kiya jaae
 kyon ulajhaa jaae sambandhon kii mithi door, sansaarik pralobhanon main
 brahmacharya kii to pehali shart yahi he ki man ko bhatakane se roka jaae
 vaasanaon par niyantran rahe
 Someone had told Kishore Vinayak that Brahmachari should not attend any wedding feast
 ve aise kaaryakramon main jane se aksar bachate bhi the
 Father Narhari Bhave was there, if anyone else had known, the younger brother would have gone
 Vinoba's body was weak
 bachapan se hi koi na koi vyaadhi lagi rahati
 magar man-mastishk puri tarah chaitanya
 maano sharir kii sari shaktiyaan simatakar dimag main samaa gai haa
 smriti vilakshan thi
 Kishore Vinayak had well memorized hundreds of verses of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev along with the Vedas, Upanishads
 gita unhen bachapan se hi kanthsth thi
 Later on, forty thousand verses were also well rumored in his mind
 vinayak kii badi bahan kaa vivaah tay hua to maano pariksha kii ghadi bhi kareeb aa gai
 He decided that he would stay away from the feast on the occasion of marriage
 No one should interrupt, so they announced to keep fast that day
 bahan ke vivaah main bhai upwas rakhe, yah bhi uchit na tha
 Father got angry on hearing this
 magar maa ne baat sambhaal lee
 He persuaded the son to eat simple 'dal-bhat'
 yahi nahin apane haathon se alag pakaakar bhi diya
 Married to grandeur
 vinayak ne khushi-khushi usamen hissaa liya
 But i had to live only for my mother with specially made pulses
 maa-bete kaa yah prem aage bhi bana rahaa
 Later, when he left home to retire, he carried a red-edged dhoti of mother and a statue from their worship house
 murti to unhone duusare ko bhent kar di thi
 But the mother's dhoti would carry with her wherever she went
 While sleeping, keeping the headrest
 Like walking around with mother's blessings
 Even the ascetic could not escape the memory of his mother
 maa ke sanskaar hi vinoba kii aadhyatmik chetana kii neenv bane
 His biography developed on him
 aage chalakar unhone rachanaatmakataa or aadhyatm ke kshetra main jo khyaati arjeet kii uske mul main bhi maa kii hi preranaayen thim
 Rukmini Bai was less educated
 sanskrit samaj nahin aati thim
 But the mind was that there was a longing for Gita and knowledge
 One day the mother put her difficulty before the son- vinoba dharmik sanskaron main paakhand ke virdohi the
 At the time of his mother's death, Vinoba had differences with his father and brothers
 vinoba brahmanon ke haath se paramparaagat tareeke se dah-sanskaar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 But in front of the family's insistence, they did not do one
 Vinoba too stood firm on his principles
 nateeja yah ki jis maa ko ve sabase adhik chaahate the, jo unki aadhyatmik guru thim, unke antim sanskaar se ve dur hi rahe
 He bid farewell to the mother with silent eyes
 aage chalakar 29 oktober 1947 ko vinoba ke pita kaa nidhan hua to unhone vedon ke nirdesh ki ‘mitti par mitti kaa hi adhikaar he’ kaa paalan karte hue unki deh ko agni-samarpit karne ke bajaay, mitti main dabaane jor diya
 By then Vinoba saints had become Vinoba
 gandhi ji kaa unhen aashirwad tha
 So this time they did it
 maa kii gita main aasthaa thi
 She was entrusted with the task of translating Geeta into Marathi to Vinoba
 vinoba us kaary main manoyog se lage the
 Finally the translation work is complete
 pustak kaa naam rakhaa gaya- gitai
 gita+ai = gitai
 maharashtra main ‘ai’ kaa abhipraay ‘maa ke prati’ se he; yani maa kii smriti uske neh se judi-rachi gita
 putr kii kriti ko dekhne ke liye to rukmini bai jivit nahin thim
 But Geetai, associated with his memory and desire, started getting mired in the grief of mothers and sisters from house to house in Maharashtra
 unki aadhyatm chetana kaa aabhushan ban gai
 When Gandhiji listened, he praised the translation work
 jo mahilaayein sanskrit nahin jaanati thim, jinhen apni bhashaa kaa bhi aadha-adhuraa gyaan tha, unke liye sahaj-saral bhashaa main rachi gai ‘gitai’, gita kii aadhyatmikta main doobane ke liye vardaan ban gai
 Vinoba's rites received from his mother in his childhood continued to get thicker in his youth
 yuvavastha kii ore badhate hue vinoba na to sant gyaneshwar ko bhula paae the, na tukaraam ko
 That was his ideal
 sant tukaraam ke abhang to ve bade hi manoyog se gaate
 unka apane aradhy se ladanaa-jhagadna, naaraaz hokar gaali dena, ruuthana-manaanaa unhen bahut acha lagata
 sant ramdaas kaa jivan bhi unhen prerana detaa
 ve na shankaracharya ko vismrit kar paae the, na unke sanyas ko
 Darshan was his favorite subject
 himalay jab se hosh sambhala tha, tabhi se unki sapanom main aata tha or ve kalpana main swayan ko satya kii khoj main gahan kandaraon main tap-sadhana karte hue pate
 vahaan kii nirjan, varf se dhaki deergh-gahan kandaraon main unhen paramasatya kii khoj main leen ho jane ke liye uksaatin
 In 1915 he passed the High School examination
 ab aage kya padhaa jaae
 vaigyanik pravriti ke pita or aadhyatm main dubi rahane vaali maa kaa vaicharik dwandv vahaan bhi alag-alag dhaaraon main prakat hua
 Father said - 'read French
' Mother said - 'brahmin's son should not read Sanskrit, how is it possible!' Vinoba kept the mind of both of them
 inter main french ko chunaa
 He continued to study Sanskrit at a personal level
 un dinon french gyaan-vigyaan ke kshetra main ho rahi kranti kii bhashaa thi
 All the transformative literature was being created in it
 duusari ore baroda kaa pustkaalay durlabh pustakon, pandulipiyon ke khajaane ke liye puure desh main prasiddh tha
 Vinoba made that library his second destination
 vidhyalay se jaise hi chuttee milti, ve pustkaalay main jaakar adhyayan main dub jate
 francisi sahitya ne vinoba kaa parichay pashchimi deshon main ho rahi vaicharik kranti se karaayaa
 sanskrit ke gyaan ne unhen vedon or upanishdon main gaharaai se paithne kii yogyata di
 If the level of knowledge increased, then his ardor also increased
 But the attraction of the Himalayas from the mind, the practice of renunciation, did not go away
 un dinon inter kii pariksha ke liye mumbai janaa padataa tha
 Vinoba also boarded a train going to Mumbai on 25 March 1916 as per schedule
 At that time, his mind was turbulent
 puraa vishwaas tha ki hiskool kii tarah inter kii pariksha bhi paas kar hi lenge
 magar uske baad kya? kya yahi unke jivan kaa lakshya he? vinoba ko lag rahaa tha ki apane jivan main ve jo chaahate hai, vah aupchaarik adhyayan dwaara sambhav nahin
 The certificates of the school and the degrees of the college are not his intention
 railgadee apni gati se bhaag rahi thi
 Vinoba's mind was running faster than him
 After all, victory was of the mind
 jaise hi gaadi surat pahunchi, vinoba usase neeche utar aae
 The car moved forward but Vinoba's mind went on pulling to the other side
 duusare platform par purv kii ore jane vaali railgadee maujuud thi
 Vinoba felt that the Himalayas were once again inviting him
 grihasth jivan yaa sanyas
 man main kuch der tak sangharsh chalaa
 uhapoh se guzarate hue unhone unhone nirnay liya or usee gaadi main savaar ho gaye
 The Saints set out on their favorite journey
 Unaware of the fact that this time also the journey for which they have set out, is not their real journey, but only a halt
 jivan se palaayan unki niyati nahin
 He has to emerge as a hope for the lives of millions and millions of Indians
 brahm kii khoj, satya kii khoj, sanyas lene kii saadh main vinoba bhatak rahe the
 He left home with the same goal
 himalay kii ore yatra jari thi
 Kashi came to a halt in the middle
 mithkon ke anusaar bhagwaan shankar kii nagari
 hajaaron varshon tak dharm-darshan kaa centre rahi kaashi
 sadhu-santon or vichaarkon kaa kumbh
 jigyaasuon or gyaan-pipaasuon ko apni ore aakarshith karne vaali pavitra dharmasthali
 shankaracharya tak khud ko kaashi-yatra ke pralobhan se nahin roak paae the
 At the Ganga Ghat in Kashi, where new ideas flourish, Vittanda was also composed countless times
 usee ganga tat par vinoba bhatak rahe the
 Looking for a destination for yourself
 In search of a Guru who can show them the way forward
 jis lakshya ke liye unhone ghar choda tha, us lakshya tak pahunchane kaa maarg bataa sake
 While wandering, they reached a place where some truth-seekers were discussing
 vishay tha advait or dwait main koun sahi
 prashn kaaphi purana tha
 About twelve hundred years ago, there was a decisive debate on this
 shankaracharya or mandan mishra ke bich
 us aitihaasik bahes main dwaitvaadi mandan mishra or unki patni ko shankaracharya ne parajeet kiya tha
 The same subject was again caught between those truth-seekers
 yaa kaho ki vakt kaatane ke liye donon paksh apane-apane tarkon ke saath vitanda rach rahe the
 And then, leading the debate to a conclusion, it was suddenly announced that the monotheist had won
 vinoba chanke
 unki hansi chhot gai— On the one hand Vinoba was wandering on the ghats, in the streets of Kashi, seeking solace, in the practice of renunciation
 vahiin duusari ore ek or jigyaasu bharat ko jaanane, uske hridaypradesh kii dhadakanon ko pahchaanane, usase atmiyata bharaa rishta kaayam karne ke liye bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua hua tha
 He returned from South Africa a few months ago after gaining immense fame
 aage uski yojana bhartiya raajnneeti main dakhal dene kii thi
 The name of that seeker was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
 At the behest of his political mentor, Govind Ballabh Pant, he set out on a year-long tour of India for the purpose of knowing the soul of India
 aage chalakar bhartiya raajnneeti par chaa jane, karodon bharatiyon ke dil kii dhadkan, bhartiya swadhinata andolan kaa pramukh sutaradhar, ahimsak senaanee ban jane vaale gandhi un dinon aprasiddh hi the
 The title of 'mahatma' was also far from them
 sirf dakshin africa main chhede gaye andolan kii puunji hi unke saath thi
 Because of that he was known all over India
 un dinon unka padaav bhi kaashi hi tha
 It was as if time was playing its magic game to introduce two great souls
 kaashi main mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya dwaara sthapit hindu vishvavidhyalay main ek bada jalsa ho rahaa tha
 On February 4, 1916, raje-maharaja, Nabav, Samant were all present in the procession
 sammelan kii chata dekhte hi banati thi
 Gandhi gave a historic speech at that conference
 vah kaha jisaki us samay koi ummid nahin kar saktaa tha
 In time, Gandhi ji openly criticized the king and feudal lords, who were well-to-do by the British themselves, whose donations were run by Kashi University and other institutions, and said that Gandhiji should use his wealth for the nation building
 
 usko garibon ke kalyaan main lagaaein
 unhone awahn kiya ki ve vyapak lokhit main apane saare aabhushan daan kar den
 She had a revolutionary appeal
 sabha main khalabali much gai
 But Gandhi's smile remained the same
 agle din us sammelan kii khabaron se akhbaar range pade the
 Vinoba learned about Gandhiji only through the newspaper
 And they felt that the goal they had left home in search of was fulfilled
 vinoba kori shanti kii talash main hi ghar se nahin nikle the
 Neither were they unfamiliar with the situation in the country and the inhuman atrocities being committed by the British
 magar koi raah mil hi nahin rahi thi
 After reading the speech, he felt that this person has peace as well as revolution
 He wrote a letter to Gandhiji from there
 Answer came
 gandhi ji ke aamantran ke saath
 vinoba to uski pratiksha kar hi rahe the
 He immediately left for the Cochrab Ashram in Ahmedabad, where Gandhiji had his ashram
 7 june 1916 ko vinoba kii gandhi se pehali bhent hui
 After that Vinoba remained as Gandhiji
 gandhi ji ne bhi vinoba kii pratibha ko pahchaan liya tha
 So his comment after the first meeting was that most people come here to get something, this is the first person who came to give something
 ’ kaaphi din baad apni pehali bhent ko yaad karte hue vinoba ne kaha tha— The meeting between Gandhi and Vinoba was revolutionary
 gandhi ji ko jaise hi pataa chalaa ki vinoba apane mata-pita ko bina bataae aae hai, unhone vahiin se vinoba ke pita ke naam ek patr likhaa ki vinoba unke saath surakshit hai
 After that their relationship continued to deepen
 vinoba ne khud ko gandhi ji ke ashram ke liye samarpit kar diya
 From studies, teaching, spinning, farming work to community life, he was ahead in every activity of the ashram
 Gandhiji's statement that this young man has come to take nothing from the ashram residents but to give it was becoming true
 umr se ekadam yuva vinoba unhen anushaasan or kartavyaparayanata kaa paath to padhaa hi rahe the
 Gandhiji's influence was growing rapidly
 utani hi teji se bad rahi ashram main aane vaale kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya
 kocharab ashram chota padane laga to ahmedabad main sabarmati ke kinare nae ashram kaa kaam teji se hone laga
 lekin aazaadee ke ahimsak sainik taiyaar karne kaa kaam akele sabarmati ashram se bhi sambhav bhi na tha
 Gandhi also wanted the same ashram in Wardha
 vahaan par aise anushaasit kaaryakarta kii aavashyaktaa thi, jo ashram ko gandhi ji ke aadarshon ke anuroop chalaa sake
 iske liye vinoba sarvatha anukool paatr the or gandhi ji ke vishwasaneey bhi
 8 april 1923 ko vinoba wardha ke liye prasthaan kar gaye
 There he started editing the 'maharashtra Dharma' monthly
 marathi main prakashit hone vaali is patrika main vinoba ne niyamit rup se upanishdon or maharashtra ke santon par likhnaa aarambh kar diya, jinke kaaran desh main bhakthi andolan kii shuruyaat hui thi
 The magazine gained unexpected popularity, shortly after that it had to be weekly, Vinoba was still known as Gandhiji's disciple and satyagrahi
 patrika ke madhyam se janata unki aadhyatmik paith ko jaanane lagi thi
 At the time of World War II, the United Kingdom was being forced into a war by the United Kingdom against which a personal satyagraha was started on 17 October 1940 and Vinoba was made the first Satyagrahi by Gandhiji
 apana satyagrah shuru karne se pehle apane vichaar spasht karte hue vinoba ne ek vaktavy jari kiya tha
 It said that aage unhone itnaa or kaha - In his speeches Vinoba used to tell the people that through negative programs neither peace can be established nor war can be ended
 yuddh rugn maansikta kaa nateeja he or iske liye rachanaatmak kaaryakramon kii jarurat hoti he
 Not only the people of Europe, but the entire human race should take the responsibility
 sitambar,1951 main ke
pi
mashruvala kii pustak gandhi or marks prakashit hui or vinoba ne isaki bhoomika likhi
 In this, Vinoba showed great respect for Marx
 karl marks ko unhone vichaarak mana tha
 a thinker who had genuine sympathy for the poor
 vaise to marks ki soch main vinoba ko khot dikhi thi or lakshya par pahunchane ke tareeke ko lekar marks se unhone apana matbhed vyakt kiya
 Vinoba believed that communists arose because of the rich people
 vinoba kaa viswas tha ki har baat main barabari kaa siddhant lagu hona chahie
 He had said: Police action cannot be helpful to end the terror of communists
 isko jad se samaapt kiya jaae
 No matter how confused they may be, Vinoba did not consider the Communists to be destroyers and by arguing with them and expressing active sympathy for their aims, Vinoba wanted them on the right path
 bisiyon bhashaaon ke gyaata vinoba ji devanagari ko vishwa lipi ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate the
 For India, he favored developing Devanagari as a contact script
 ve kehete the ki main nahin kahata ki nagari hi chale, balki main chahta hum ki nagari bhi chale
 Inspired by his ideas, Nagari script Sangam has been established which works to use and spread Devanagari within India and outside India
 vistrut jaankaree ke liye nagari evam bhartiya bhashaayen padhen
 Vinobaji was always a social and creative activist
 swatantrata ke purv gandhiji ke rachaanatmak kaaryon main sakriy rup se yogadan dete rahe
 His health started deteriorating due to work, he was advised by a doctor to go to a hill station
 at: 1937 i0 main vinoba bhaave pawanaar ashram main gayi
 Since then, this has been the central place to start his creative work throughout his life
 rachaanatmak kaaryon ke atiritk ve mahaan swatantraaa senaanee bhi the
 He was imprisoned in the Nagpur Flag Satyagraha
 1937 main gandhiji jab landan kii golmes conference se khaali haath lote to jalgaanv main vinoba bhaave ne ek sabha main angrejon kii aalochana kii to unhen bandi banaakar chah maah kii sajaa di gayi
 After being freed from prison, Gandhiji made him the first Satyagrahi
 17 oktober 1940 ko vinoba bhavaji ne satyagrah kiya or ve bandi banaaye gayi tathaa unhen 3 varsh ke liye sashram karawas kaa dand mila
 Gandhiji consulted Vinobaji in 1942 before leaving India
 companiyon kaa parisamapan ek aisi kaarywahi he jisase company kaa vaidhanik astitv samaapt ho jaataa he
