 In linguistics, the study of sign processes, or expression and communication, signs and symbols is called signology
 ise aam taur par nimnlikhit teen shakhaon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he: Semiotics is often seen with important anthropological dimensions; For example, Umberto Eco proposes that every cultural phenomenon can be studied as communication
 tathaapi, kuch lakshanshasthri vigyaan ke taarkik ayaamon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 They also investigate fields related to natural science — such as how organisms can predict and adapt to their symbolic karma status in the world
 In general, semiotic theories take signs or signaling systems as their objective of study: the communication of information in living beings is covered in biosemiotics or zoologics
 vaakya-vigyaan lakshaniki kii shakha he, jo sanketon or pratikon kii aupchaarik visheshtaon ke saath sambandh rakhti he
 Actually, syntax "deals with the rules that govern how words are combined to form phrases and sentences
" Charles Morris states that semantics is concerned with the relation of signs to their instructions and the relationships they can or do represent with objects; And utilitarianism deals with the biotic aspects of semiotics, that is, all psychological, biological or social phenomena that occur in the action of signs
 shabd, jise angrezi main semeiotics likhaa jaataa he, pehali baar henry stabs dwaara sanketon ke pratipaadan se sambandhit chikitsa vigyaan kii shakha ko nirupit karne ke sunishchit arth main prayukt hua tha
 John Locke used the words semeiotike and semeiotics in book 4, chapter 21 of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding
 isamen ve bataate hai ki kaise vigyaan ko teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: Locke then elaborates on this third category of nature, naming it Σημειωτικη and explaining it as the "principle of signs" in the following words: unnisvin sadi main, charles sanders piers ne paribhaashit kiya, jise unhone "semiotic" kaha jo "sanketon kaa ardh-aavashyak, yaa aupchaarik siddhant he", jiskaa saar he "


 dwaara prayukt sabhi sanketon ke varna kya hone chahie, jise buddhi anubhav dwaara seekhney main sakasham hai" or jo sanket or sanket prakriya ke anusaar darshanik tark kaa anusaran karata he
 Charles Morris followed Pierce in using the term "semiotic" and expanded it from human communication to animal learning and use of signs
 tathaapi ferdinand de loshuar ne lakshan-vigyaan ke andar atyadhik mahatvapurn kshetra par gaur karte hue use saamaajik vigyaan se sambandhit paaya: Symptoms classify signals and signaling systems according to their mode of communication
 This process of meaningfulness relies on the use of codes used by humans to form words that may be individual vowels or letters, bodily actions to denote by their organisms or emotions, or commonly worn clothing
 kisi vastu ke sandarbh ke liye shabd gadhane hetu, samudaay dwaara apni bhashaa main ek saamaanya arth ko sweekrut karnaa hoga
 lekin vah shabd keval bhashaa kii vyakaranik sanrachana or kuta ke antargat arth ko sanchaarit kar sakegaa 
 kuta samskruti ke mulyon kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karte hai or jivan ke har pahalu ko arth ke nae rang jodne main sakasham hai
 To clarify the relationship between symptomatology and communication studies, communication is defined as the process of transferring data from source to recipient
 isliye, sampreshan ke vichaarak kuta, madhyam or sandarbh ke aadhaar par aaveshtit jaiviki, manovigyaan or yantriki ko spasht karne ke liye modelon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Both subjects also believe that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the recipient has to decode the data, ie being able to interpret the data by identifying it as the main one
 iskaa matlab he ki lakshanikta or sampreshan ke bich anivarytah paraspar vyapan he
 In fact, many concepts are shared, although the emphasis is different in each area
 messejas and minings: en introdection tu semiotics, marcel danesi sujhata he ki lakshanshastriyon kii praathamiktaayen, mahatv kaa adhyayan pehle or sampreshan baad main rahi hai
 Extremist vision was introduced by jean-jacques Nataíz, who considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to the application of semiotics as a musicologist
 lakshanikta bhashaa-vigyaan se is arth main alag he ki vah sanket kii paribhaasha ko samanyikrut karata he taaki sanketon ko kisi bhi madhyam main yaa samvedi reeti main sammilit kiya ja sake
 is prakaar yah sanket pranaaliyon or sanket sambandhon kii vyapaktaa ko badhaata he or bhashaa kii paribhaasha ko uskaa sarvaadhik vistrut alankaarik yaa lakshanik arth pradaan karata he
 Pierce's definition for the term "semiotic" as a study of the essential characteristics of signs, includes the effect of distinguishing it from linguistics as a study of contingent features acquired by the world's languages in the course of human development
 sambhawatah lakshan-vigyaan or bhashaa ke darshan ke bich bhed karnaa adhik kathin he
 In a sense, it is actually more of a difference between traditions than a difference of subjects
 vibhinn lekhakon ne khud ko "bhashaa kaa darshanik" yaa "lakshanshasthri" naam diya he
 This difference does not correspond to the separation of analytical and continental philosophy
 nazadik se dekhne par, vishyon ke sambandh main kuch matbhed paaya ja saktaa he
 Philosophy of language tends to pay more attention to natural languages or languages in general, while semiotics is more concerned with non-linguistic significance
 bhashaa ke darshan kaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke saath bhi ek majboot rishta he, jabaki sanketikta katipay manviki or saanskrithik nrivigyaan ke nikat he
 Semiosis or semeiosis is a process that derives meaning from any organism's apprehension about the world through signs
 sanketon kaa mahatv or sarthakata ko darshan or manovigyaan ke samast itihaas main manyata mili he
 Both Plato and Aristotle explore the relationship between signs and the relationship of the world, and Augustine considers the nature of the sign within the traditional system
 in siddhanton kaa pashchimi darshan par sthai prabhaav padaa, visheshkar shaikshik darshan ke madhyam se
 haal hi main, ambarto iko ne apane semiotics and filosphi of language main tark diya he ki lakshanik siddhant adhikansh, sambhawatah sabhi pramukh vichaarkon ke kaaryon main nihit he
 Early thinkers in this field include Charles W
 Morris Max Black considers Bertrand Russell's work preliminary
 lakshanikta ke anuprayogon main shaamil hai: Semiotics is only slowly establishing itself as an honorable subject
 kuch deshon main, uski bhoomika keval saahitiyik aalochana or drishy or shravy madhyamon tak hi simit he, lekin yah sankeern sankendran saamaajik or raajnneetik balon ke vyapak saamaanya adhyayan tak vistrut ho saktaa he ki kaise aadhunik samskruti ke antargat sakriy sthiti ko aakaar diya ja saktaa he
 In the current era of mass communication, issues of technology determinism assume new importance in the selection of media and the design of communication strategies
 arth ke vibhinn str or kabhi-kabhi chhipe prayojanon ko prakat karne ke liye lakshanik tareekon ke upyog ne kuch ko marxvaadi, nashwadi aadi ke rup main vishay ke tatwon ko naarkeey rup dene ko uksaaya he 
 Research has been published in dedicated journals such as Sign System Studies, founded by Juri Lotman and published by Tartu University Press; Semiotica, founded by Thomas A
 Sebeok and published by Mouton de Gruyter; Zeitschrift fur Semiotic; European Journal of Semiotics; Versus and others; Accepted articles in magazines of the American Journal of Semiotics and other subjects, especially magazines oriented towards philosophy and cultural criticism
 lakshanikta ne kai up-kshetron ko utpann kiye hai, jinamein nimnlikhit shaamil hai, par ye itane tak hi simit nahin he: Pictorial semiotics is intimately associated with art history and theory
 tathaapi, yah donon se kam se kam ek moulik tareeke se aage bad gai he
 While the history of art has limited its visual analysis to the small number of paintings that qualify as "artistic creations", pictorial semiotics has generally focused on the characterization of the paintings
 kala ke is paaramparik itihaas or siddhant se-or saath hi, lakshanik vishleshan kii anya pramukh dhaaraon se hatakar-sachitr lakshanikta ke liye vistrut vividhta kii sambhaavnaaon ko mauqaa miltaa he
 Some influences have been derived from event-action analysis, cognitive psychology, structural and cognitive linguistics and visual anthropology / sociology
 lakshanik siddhant ko varnit karne ke liye aahaar ek manapsand paaramparik vishay rahaa he, kyonki vah atyant sulabh he or ausat vyakti ke jivan se aasaani se joda ja saktaa he
 Semiotics is the study of signaling processes when it operates individually or in groups and how these signaling processes provide insight into circulating and understanding meaning
 aahaar ko isliye lakshanik kaha he kyonki taiyaar ho jane par uskaa arth badal jaataa he
 The comparison of the diet eaten by a wild animal to that of a corpse to represent a cultural dish clearly changes meaning when compared to a diet prepared by humans in the kitchen
 khaadya padaarth ko kuch saamaajik sanket-paddatiyon kaa pratik bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 "if food is treated as a gesture, the message it encodes will be found in the pattern of expressive social relationships
 The different hierarchies of message hierarchy, inclusion and exclusion, boundaries and boundaries transcend -day is about "
 aahaar is baat kaa lihaaj kiye bina hi lakshanik he ki use kaise taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Whether food is prepared with full precision in a good dining restaurant, or picked up from a pile of garbage, broken, swallowed, or eaten by a wild animal can still always be interpreted on this basis How a particular diet was prepared and in what context it was served
 vartmaan anusandhan ne paaya ki, jaise-jaise shakhaaen viksit hoti hai or adhik antarrashtriya ho jaati hai, unke pratik-chihn adhik pratikatmak or kam pratishthit ho jate hai
 The prestige and symbolism of a sign depends on cultural conventions and are related to each other on that basis
 yadi saanskrithik pratha kaa sanket par atyadhik prabhaav he, to sanket adhik pratikatmak mulya hasil karte hai

 namakan prakriya : The scientific study of the traditional faith is a brief introduction to new discoveries on the sweet relation of human life and religion
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki paraprakritik vishwaas kaa logon ke jivan main lambe samay se mahatva rahaa he, shaaman yaa ojha ke punahnirmit itihaas ke aadhaar par yah avadhi 65000 varsh hogi
 Along with the development of civilization, the traditional belief took the form of religion, and influenced literature, art and society
 anumaan he ki puure vishwa main lagbhag 1 xxrep 4 0 dharm hai, or prayek dharm main anekon alokik tatv 
 Scientists think that, most of the deities are confined to small communities, but some deities must have started to develop in large religions from about 12000 years ago and spread in the world
 pichley kuch dashakon main, paraprakritik vishwaas ke jaivik or saanskrithik udvikas par nai khojon main vaigyanikon ne spasht kiya ki unka aashay kisi alokik tatv kii bhautik satta se nahin tha, unhone paaya ki devi-devataaon main vishwaas samooh ke sadasyon main sahyog, maansik swasthya tathaa sneh kii bhaavana ke vikaas main sahaayak he
 Discoveries in literature and art show that they also have a deep penetration of the traditional faith, and a unique inclusion of supernatural elements, such as a Russell's teapot, flying saucer, spider-man, etc
 devi-devataaon main vishwaas par hue in adhyayanon ke chaar mukhya pahalu gramin parivesh, maansik swasthya, sahyog, or sneh kii bhaavana hai
 Countless articles related to the traditional belief fall into this aspect and reflect the lifestyle of local groups
 aise parichay vishwa, tathaa kshetreey, jaise pashchim himalay, str par, vistrut rup main uplabdh hai
 In these, a rural deity is said to have supernatural, jurist, physician, Mahavira, prophet, etc
 inkaa vistrut varnan bhi he, jaise bharat main, himachal pradesh ke kinnaur jile ke lok devtaa, or unase sambandhit, geet, kathaayen, lokoktiyaan, natya, bhashaa, tathaa paramparaayen, or inke abhipraay
 In another endeavor, the deity of Kinnaur is the main part of Aranyak sheep and goat farming, the main lifestyle there
 in sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, ek itihaaskaar kii raay he ki sthaneey vikaas ke kaaryakramon main, lok chetana kii nirnay lene main bhoomika ho
 Under the second aspect are the studies in which traditional belief, diversity of supernatural elements, and changes in them were linked to mental health
 ashis nandi ke lekh main bharat ke taintis karod devi-devtaa jo chote-chote samoohon kii jivan shaileyon ke pratibimb hai, jinamein is badlaav ke sakshya in devi-devataaon ke bahari pratikon or paramparaon, tathaa jan maanas kii gaharaai main dekhe gaye
 Taking another reference, Sudhir Kakad did not decide the role of supernatural elements in mental health, in a country like India, by bringing spirituality gurus engaged in exorcism and the message of liberation, according to the ideology of psychoanalysis
 Also studied accurately
 man kii anya vichaardhaaraon, manochikitsa tathaa nrivigyaan, main hue adhyayan maansik swasthya main alokik tatwon kii sakaaratmak bhoomika ke pakshdhar hai
 The third aspect is in the context of discoveries in social biology and evolutionary psychology on traditional beliefs and local traditions
 madhav gadgil or unke saathiyon dwaara dev van kii pratha or iskaa jaivik smapda ke sangrakshan main yogadan kaa adhyayan, jaivik or saanskrithik, donon pakshon ko jodta he
 Complex and costly rituals involving supernatural elements were found useful in the development of cooperation in scientific discoveries
 jaigalatas or uske saathiyon ne, hinduon ke thapusam tyohaar main jatil or manhage anushthan karne vaale kwadi ke bhakton kii tulana saadhaaran bhakton se kii, kavadiyon main sahyog kii bhaavana zyada thi
 Their development is possible by group selection, not an individual, the whole group will spread or become extinct
 
 Small groups of people in the world, in which the image of the deity is in the person's mind as the supreme knowledgeable, punisher, and mortuary, is helpful in mutual cooperation
 sankshep main, in khojon kaa mukhya bindu, paraprakritik vishwaas or samaaj main aapasi mail-jol he
 The fourth aspect focuses on studies in which the discovery of traditional beliefs and mutual affection between people
 manovigyaan or isse jude duusare vishyon ke sanyukt prayaas se, man tathaa vyavhaar par dev aasthaa kaa prabhaav jaanane ke liye ye nae prayog hue
 The mainstay of many of these discoveries is to link John Bowlby's theory of affection with faith to supernatural elements
 sneh siddhanth ke chaar sangyanatmak yaa aatanrik praaroop hai, bachche kaa maan, yaa bhakt kaa devtaa, se nikat sambandh, isse bichhudane par virah vednaa, iske sahare parisar kii khoj, tathaa, bahari bhay se isamen aasraa lenaa
 These internal forms, psychologists, formed the basis of experiments to understand the devotee's love for his imperial deity, which yielded positive results

 This increases the brightness of the star
 yah nova visphot kitni tezi se chal rahaa he iskaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya jaataa he ki taare kii yah barhi hui chamak kis gati se kam hoti he
 This brightness is measured in astronomical magnitudes, which is a contrast measurement: the lower the magnitude of an object, the more illuminated the object is
 agar nova dhimi gati se chal rahaa he to us taare ke magnitude main 2 ankon kaa antar padane main 80 din se bhi adhik sakate hai or agar tezi se chal rahaa he to 25 dinon ke andar bhi aisa ho saktaa he

 The collective designation refers to the current project by the Indian government to nominate a representative example of its historic railways to UNESCO as a World Heritage Site
 The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was recognized in 1999, while the Nilgiri Mountain Railway was added as an extension to the site in 2005
 They were recognized for being outstanding examples of bold, ingenious engineering solutions for the problem of establishing an effective rail link through a rugged, mountainous terrain
 Both the kalka-shimla Railway and the Matheran Hill Railway are on the tentative nomination list for that site

 gardez Garadez is a city in eastern Afghanistan
 yah pakatiya praant kii rajdhani bhi he or pakistan kii seemaa ke nazadik he
 The population of the city of Gardez was estimated to be around 70,000 in 2008, most of which were Pashto-speaking Pathans
 yah shahar ek badi vaadi main sthit he jiske uttar, purv or pashchim main hindu kush ke parvat hai
 The city is at an altitude of 2,300 meters and is near the famous Tora Bora area with caves and tunnels
 shahar se ruud-e-gardez nikalati he jo aab-e-istadaa naamak jhil main jaakar khatm ho jaati he
 Garadez is located at the crossroads of roads leading from Ghazni to Pakistan and Kabul
 is vajah se yah purvi afghanistan main vyapaar kaa centre rahaa he or isane bahut se aakraamakon ke hamale sahe hai
 More than two thousand years ago, stone posts built by Alexander the Great to guard the surrounding hills are still slowly breaking
 gardez ke bich main oonchaai par bala hisar qila he, jiskaa matlab 'oonchaai kaa qila' hota he
 In the middle of Garadez is Bala Hisar Fort and the city is divided into four parts: creole bhashaa yaa sirf creole aisi sthai bhashaa ko kehete hai jo do yaa do se adhik bhashaaon ke mishran se paidaa hui ho
 For this reason they are sometimes referred to as slang languages, although they are different from the dialects made from a common mixture because creole speakers adopt them as their mother tongue and have characteristics of natural languages
 
 yah pigin se alag hoti hai kyonki pigin boliyaan kai bhashaa-samudaayon ke ek saath sampark hone par bhashaa-mishran se apsi talmail main prayog hone lagati hai unhen koi bhi samudaay apni maatrubhaasha ke liye prayog nahin karata
 The words of Creole languages come from their mother tongues, often with one or two main words, most of French and Bhojpuri words in Maurice spoken in Mauritius
 dekha gaya he ki bahut se shabdon ke uccharan va arth mul bhashaaon se badal jate hai
 Similarly, there are often many innovations in the grammar of Creole languages which are different from Janani languages
