 2625 BCE represents the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2625 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2625 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate hai
 The probability of occurrence of an event is called probability or probability
 sankhyikee, ganit, vigyaan, darshanashastra aadi kshetron main iskaa bahutayat se prayog hota he
 Probability is generally related to an event that is more likely to occur than not
 is arth main yah shakya se bhinn he
 The event is possible when there is no resistance to its occurrence
 'rvadhya mata' kaa hona na to shakya he or na sambhavya hi
 The 'golden Mountain' is not possible, but it is possible
 vaigyanik arth main sambhavyata kaa sambandh us ghatana se he jo na to nishchit he or na asambhav
 If the symbol of definite knowledge is to be considered as 'one' and 'zero' for lack of definite knowledge, then the place of probability can be determined between these '0' and '1'
 sambhavyata ke aadhaar hote hai
 Zevons considers the basis of probability subjective
 unhone vishwaas ko sambhavyata kaa aadhaar mana he
 This view is said to be faulty, because probability is related to quantity and it is not possible to express confidence in quantity
 vishwaas ko sambhavyata kaa aadhaar maananaa isliye bhi uchit nahin janchataa kyonki sambhavyata kii gananaa hoti he or yah gananaa vishwaas ke saath sambhav nahin he
 That is because the belief in something is never experienced and sometimes the trust of two people becomes different on one experience
 sambhavyata kaa sambandh aagaman se he
 Arrival is based on inspection and testing
 at: sambhavyata ko purna rup se aatmagat kahana uchit nahin, kyonki nirikshan or pareekshan vishaygat he
 Due to these above errors, some thinkers have certified the possibility as thematic
 sambhavyata anubhav par nirbhar karti he
 Experience is thematic
 anubhav ke aadhaar par hi ghatana ke hone yaa na hone main hamaara vishwaas hota he
 This belief is subjective
 at: nishkarsh yah nikalataa he ki sambhavyata kaa aadhaar anubhav or vishwaas donon hi hai
 Probability is calculated by mathematics
 ghatnaayen vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai
 Therefore, the method of calculating their probability is also different
 saral ghatana kii sambhaavna nikaalane ke liye ghatana ghatit hone kii sambhaavna kii sankhya main ghatana ke hone kii sambhaavna ko sampurna sankhya se bhaag dete hai
 This time the rule is to know the possibility of the king of black betel by pulling in 52 cards of cards
 at: kaala paan kaa badshaah nikalne kii sambhaavna 1 / 52 he
 Two events that do not happen together have to add their different probability to calculate the probability of an event occurring
 taash kii 52 pattiyon main gulam or badshaah kisi ek ke nikalne kii sambhaavna he : Similarly, the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously by multiplying their different probabilities together
 indradhanush tathaa varsha, in donon swatantra ghatnaon ke saath saath ghatit hone kii sambhaavna hogi : The same rule is also applicable with the subordinate events
 ekatrit kiye hue pramaan kii satyata kii sambhaavna ko jaanane ke liye 1 main se uski asambhaavnaaon ke gunanfal ko gata dete hai
 The probability of an event told by other witnesses to be true can be deduced as: When a testimony is 5 / 6 the probability of being true will be unlikely to be true
 phir duusari gavaahi main satya hone kii sambhaavna jab 2 / 3 he to usamen asambhaavna hogi By subtracting the product of these two different possibilities, the answer will be - is prakaar gavaahon dwaara bataai hui ghatana ke satya hone kii sambhaavna 17 / 18 hogi
 Thus the quantity of probability is calculated on the basis of number
 at: sankhya kii gananaa purna rup se nahin hone par sambhavyata kii maatra nishchit nahin kii ja sakati
 The conclusion that is obtained after calculating the probability is true only for the average
 duusare shabdon main yah kahen ki sambhavyata ausat ke liye satya hoti he

 professor vishwamitra ne ek sanghathan banaaya he jo purushon ko shaadi na karne ke liye prerit karata he kyonki unke mutabik mahila jivan ko narak banaati he
 Dushyant Kumar is also a member of that organization
 dushyant ke mata-pita mahilaon ke bare main dushyant ke vichaaron ke kaaran bahut pareshaan hai
 Once Dushyant has to be Manali for business purpose
 vishwamitra use ladakiyon se dur rakhane ke liye ek vyaakhyaan detaa he kyonki vahaan pyaar main padane kaa bada mauka he
 So Dushyant is celebrated with all the advice in mind
 lekin, vahaan vah sabhi dekhbhaal ke baavjood shakuntla urf shaku se pyaar karne lagata he
 Shaku also falls in love with Dushyant
 dushyant bombai jane se pehle shaku se vaada karata he ki vah phir se aayega or usase shaadi karegaa

 At first, Vishwamitra protests but eventually he agrees to keep Shaku with him for a few days
 ab vah bhi shaku ke saath pyaar main padataa he or mahilaon ke bare main apane sabhi vichaar bhul jaataa he
 He closes his organization
 vah shaku ko manaane kii koshish karata he ki vah use pyaar karata he
 On the other hand, when Dushyant and Shaku find out that they are both in Bombay, he becomes overjoyed

 use us tarah shaku ke bare main nahin sochna chahie
 Eventually Vishwa agrees after a long drama played by Dushyant and marries his old lover

 - anuvanshiki or rog main bahudhaa koi na koi sambandh rahata he
 Many diseases are caused by contaminated environment and conditions, but there are many diseases due to which there is a defect due to birth from parents
 e rog anuvanshik rog kehalaate hai
 There are some diseases that arise as a result of both genetics and environmental influences
 jeevon main nar ke shukranu tathaa stri kii andkoshika ke sanyog se santan kii utpatti hoti he
 Both the sperm and scrotum contain nucleus
 in cendrakasutron main sthit jin ke swabhavanusaar santan ke maansik tathaa shaareerik gun or dosha nishchit hote hai
 Because of one or a few genes being defective, only those defects occur in the child
 kuch dosha main se koi rog utpann nahin hota, keval santan kaa shaareerik sanghathan aisa hota he ki usamen vishesh prakaar ke rog sheeghra utpann hote hai
 Therefore, to know for sure whether the cause of the disease is heredity or adverse environment is not always feasible
 anuvanshik rogon kii sahi gananaa main anya kathinaaiyaan bhi hai
 For example; Many congenital diseases appear only when they are old
 duusari ore, kuch anuvanshik doshayukt bachche janm lete hi mar jate hai
 The disease is manifested in each generation due to their effect on the presence of antitussive pathogenic genes, but diseases caused by the degraded gene occur spontaneously in any offspring of the offspring, as evident by Mendel's hereditary rules
 kuch rog ladakiyon se kahin adhik sankhya main ladakon main paae jate hai
 Many examples of genetic diseases can be given
 inamen se kuch nimnlikhit hai : Cataract, hyperpigmentation, glaucoma, long-sightedness, etc
, occur due to defect of anticonvulsant gene
 tirohit jin ke kaaran vivarnataa, astigmatism, keratoconus, ityadi rog utpann hote hai
 Sexually transmitted genital diseases, which are more prevalent in men, are diseases like blindness, night blindness, night blindness etc
 inamen ek sau se adhik anuvanshik rogon kii gananaa kii gai he
 Among these are psoriasis, ichthiasis, keratosis, etc
 adhikangulata, yuktangulata, kai prakaar kabonapan, asthiyon kaa uchit reeti se na viksit hona, janm se hi nitambasthi kaa ukhda rahanaa ityadi Haemophilia, special types of anemia etc
 madhumeh, gathiya, chehre kaa vikrut tathaa bhayaavah ho janaa ityadi
 Heredity, epilepsy, hypnosis may also be the cause of heredity
 vividh rog, jaise bahraapan, goongaapan, kataa hont, videern taalu aadi bhi anuvanshikta se prabhavit hote hai
 Apart from this, heredity causes inclination towards diseases like esophagus, high blood pressure, cancer etc

 In linguistics, 'syllable' or syllable is an organized unit of sounds
 kisi bhi shabd ko anshon main todakar bolaa ja saktaa he or shabdaansh shabd ke vah ansh hote hai jinhen or zyaada chota nahin banaaya ja saktaa varanaa shabd kii dhvaniyaan badal jaati hai
 For example, the word 'suddenly' has three syllables - 'A', 'cha' and 'naq'
 yadi ruk-ruk kar 'a-chaa-nak' bolaa jaye to shabd ke teenon shabdaansh khandit rup se dekhe ja sakate hai lekin shabd kaa uccharan sunne main sahi prathit hota he
 If 'nak' is broken further, the sounds of the word become wrong - 'a-cha-na-k'
 This word is also not called 'a-chan-k' because it also makes the pronunciation wrong
 kuch chote shabdon main ek hi shabdaansh hota he, jaise 'main', 'kaan', 'haath', 'chal' or 'ja'
 kuch shabdon main do shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'chalakar', khaanaa, rumal or sabzi 
 Some have three or more syllables, such as 'important' and 'international'
 akshar shabd kaa arth he - 'jo na ghat sake, na nasht ho sake'
 It was earlier used for 'speech' or 'speech' and for syllable

 'intaraashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan, jise adhiktar ISO kaha jaataa he, vibhinn rashtron ke maanak sanghathanon ke pratinidhiyon se gathit ek anterrashtriya maanak-vinyas sanstha he
 It was established on February 23, 1947, to declare worldwide industrial and commercial standards
 iskaa mukhyalay geneva, switzraland main sthit he
 Although ISO calls itself an NGO, its ability to set standards, which often become law, either by agreements, or national values; This makes it more powerful than ngos
 vaise vyavhaar main yah ek sankaay yaa alpakaaleen sanghathan jaise karyrat he, jisaki sarkaron se majboot kaniyaan hai
 
 is sanghathan kaa logo yaa chihn do aadhikarik bhashaaon main he amareeki angreji evam french
 It also contains ISO characters, which it is often known as, which is its abbreviation
 balki yah sankshipti unani / greek shabd ἴσος se bana he, jiskaa arth he baraabar
 Assuming that the organization will have a different concatenation in different languages, it decided to run an all-encompassing universal name ISO
 yah swayan main is sanghathan kaa uddeshy siddh karata he
 The main products of ISO are international standards
 ISO dwaara hi prakashit hai : takneekee report, takneekee vishesheekaran, saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran, takneekee shuddhipatr, evam and pathpradarshak
 The international standard is interpreted as the ISO xxrep 5 n heading, where xxrep 5 n is the standard number, xxrep 4 y is the year of publication, and the heading indicates the subject
 If the standard is the result of the work of the Joint Technical Committee JTC1, then the IEC is also included
 ASTM International ke sahyog se viksit maanakon main ASTM ko bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 The use of dates and iss is incompatible for incomplete or unpublished standards, and in some circumstances the title of a published work may also be omitted
 takneekee report jari hoti he, jab koi takneekee samiti yaa up-samiti ne saamanyatya prakashit anterrashtriya maanak se bhinn prakaar kaa koi aankana sangrahit kiya ho, jaise ki sandarbh yaa vyakhyaayein
 Their naming conventions are similar to the standards, only TR is applied instead of IS, before the report name
 udhaahrantah The technical specialization can be composed when "the subject concerned is still in development, or for some other reason there is a possibility of consent to publish an international standard in the future"
 saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran koi "madhyavarti vishesheekaran ho sakate hai, jo ki purna anterrashtriya maanak ke vikaas se purv hi prakashit hua ho", yaa, IEC main 'dwicihn' prakaashan, jo ki kisi bahari sanghathan ke sahyog se prakashit hua ho " donon ke hi namakaran takneekee report kii bhaanti hi kiya jaataa he
 For example ISO kabhi kabhi takneekee / paribhaashik shuddhipatr bhi jari karata he
 These are amendments to the current standards, which are made for petty technical / technical errors, usability improvements, or limited applicability
 praayah inhen is aashaa ke saath jari kiya jaat he ki prabhavit maanak yato uddhrut yaa waapas liya jayega, apane agle anusoochna panravlokan tak
 ISO guides are quasi-standard, with subjects related to international standardization
 in kaa namakaran "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : sheershak" main hota he, udhaahrantah ISO documents are copyright protected, and ISO values most copies
 vaise adhiktar ke mulya keval electronic roopakar main hi liye jate hai
 Although useful, but using these documents, it is worth noting that they are also likely to change in abundance, before it becomes a standard
 ISO evam iske aadhikarik sanyukt rajya pratinidhi evam anterrashtriya vidyutatakneekee ayog dwaara kuch maanak ni:shulk uplabdh karaae jate hai
 ISO has 157 national members, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO kii teen sadsyta shreniyan hai: Participating members are called "P" or p members, while the compliant members are called "O" or o members
 is tathy ne, ki kai iso-srujit maanak sarvgat, sarvyaapee hai; kai maukon par, "ISO" kaa saamaanya prayog prerit kiya he, us utpaada ko varnit karne hetu, jo ki maanakon ko maanata he
 There are many examples of this: maanakeekaran ke kshetron main, prachur aachhadan ke parinaamon se, evam soochna praudyogiki se sambandhit karyon se, nibatane hetu; ISO evam IEC yaa anterrashtriya vidyutatakneekee ayog se ek sanyukt takneekee samiti gathit kijise ISO / IEC JTC1 ke nam se janaa jaataa he
 This AC is the first committee, and is the same till date

 kallekhi ek vishesh prakaar kii ghadi hoti he jise 'stop vaach' ke rup main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 But originally, Kalik was a device in which there was a time to 'write' on paper or lace
 aarmabhik kallekhi hi ve yantra the jo vastav main 'lekhan' karte the
 The modern chronograph is a special type of watch that can be used in a work like a 'stopwatch'
 jyotish ke kaamon main prayukt kiye janevaale kalalikh adhiktar nimnlikhit siddhanth par bane rahete hai : ek belanaakaar dhol par kaagaj lapet diya jaataa he
 The drum is rotated with the same speed so that it makes one or two rounds per minute
 ek lekhnee is kaagaj ke upar is prakaar lagi rahati he ki dhol ke ghoomane se vah kaagaj par rekha khinchati jaati he
 The stylus also diverts from one side to another by screw
 isliye kaagaj par khinchi rekha sarpilaakaar hoti he
 The pen is connected to an electromagnet
 is vidyucchumbak main ghadi dwaara prati second ek vidyut dhara kshan bhar ke liye aati rahati he jisase lekhnee prati second kshar bhar ke liye ek ore khinch jaati he
 Therefore, every second mark is drawn in a line drawn on paper
 jab kisi vishesh ghatana ke ghatane par batan dabaane se vah lekhnee hatakar us ghatana ke samay ko bhi ankit kar detii he
 Measuring the distance between signs can indicate the time of the event to be a hundredth of a second
 kabhi-kabhi kaagaj chadhe belanaakaar dhol kii jagah kaagaj ke feete kii reel kaa prayog karte hai
 The ribbon is carried from the bottom of the stylus to the ribbon
 isamen suvidha yah hoti he ki yantra chota hota he, kintu asuvidha yah he ki feete par ke samay ke lekhe ko surakshit rakhana or baad main prayog karnaa kathin hota he
 Sometimes two stationers are used instead of one, one to mark the second and the other the time of the event
 isamen dosha yah hota he ki prayek lekhnee ke kinare hatane se bhinn samay lag saktaa he or is kaaran naape hue samay main thodi truti pad sakati he
 If the time of events received by different instruments is to be found, more than two authors can also be used
 prayek lekhnee kaa vidyut chumbak ek bhinn yantra dwaara chaalit hota he
 Later, so-called timelines have been made in which signs of minutes, seconds and hundredths of seconds are printed on the paper by a spinning circle in which the type of the raid is printed
 chhapane vaala chakra ek niyantrak dwaara samaan veg se ghumta he or ghadi dwaara is veg par niyantran rakhaa jaataa he
 To mark the time of the event, there is a small hammer which is quickly removed by hitting the paper upon pressing the button
 isse vah ank, jo us kshan hathaudi ke sammukh rahata he, kaagaj par chap jaataa he
 Thus the time of occurrence is known without any measurement, but it takes some time to mark the stylus or hammer marks and there is a possibility of some error in the measurement
 at: bahut sookshm naapon ke liye aise kalalikh banaae gaye hai jinamein vidyut sphuling dwaara ghatnakram ankit kiya jaataa he
 Two curtains are placed to measure the velocity of the gun or gunshot
 goli ke ek parde se duusare parde tak pahunchne ke samay ko naap kar goli kii gati nimnlikhit sutara se jaani ja sakati he : There is no difficulty in measuring the distance between the curtains, but the measurement of time should be very subtle
 yadi gati 2,000 foot prati second ho to 100 foot duuri paar karne main goli ko kul 1 / 20 second lagata he
 Different types of curtains are used
 ek prakaar kaa pardaa do vidyut chaalak patron ke bich pruthakkari rakhkar banaaya jaataa he
 When the bullet pierces the curtain, both the driver curtains are approached by the bullet and at that moment the electromagnet goes on
 ye parde baar-baar prayukt kiye ja sakate hai, par inamen asuvidha yah rahati he ki parde main ghusane se goli kii gati main antar pad jaataa he
 In the second type of curtains, electromagnetic induction is used
 parde ke sthaan par bijli ke taar ke vrutt lage rahete hai
 a bullet is a magnetized bullet rather than an ordinary bullet
 jab yah goli taar ke vrutt main se hokar jaati he to taar main vidyut utpann hoti he jisase sanket mil jaataa he
 Light-electrical curtains are also used
 telephoto lens dwaara goli kaa chitra ek prakaash vaidyut cell par daalate hai
 When the shot continues from the front of the lens, the light in the cell also decreases as the light decreases
 or saath hi vidyut dhara bhi
 The signal can be sent by this sudden rising current
 goli kaa veg naapane ke liye kaagaj lapete dhol kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Simple: The drum sounds 60 revolutions per second
 goli parde ko jab paar karti he tab us samay ke sanket dwaara utpann sphulling kaagaj ko ankit kar detaa he
 In another type of soot, instead of putting ordinary paper on the drum, we apply photography paper
 dhol andhere bakse main ghumta he or saath hi dhire-dhire ek kinare hatataa jaataa he
 The reflected light reflection from the mirror of the oscillating photometer goes through a hole and draws a line on the photo paper
 jab parde se sanket aata he to dharamapi kaa darpan gum jaataa he or paravartit prakashakiran chhidr kii sidh main nahin rahati
 Due to the absence of light, the line seems cut off at that place
 ek duusare dharamapi dwaara prati 1 / 1000 second ek chihn is rekha par banataa jaataa he; isse naapane main suvidha hoti he
 In the Second World War, circuits of radio valvo were also used to measure time
 in yantron main teen bhaag hote hai
 The first part has a oscillator from which electric pulsing is sent per 1 / 1,00,000th second
 duusare bhaag main yantra ko chalaane or band karne kaa prabandh rahata he
 When the signal comes from the first screen, the device automatically starts running and automatically stops when the signal comes from the second screen
 tisare bhaag main vidyutspandon ko ginaney kaa prabandh rahata he
 Their count shows how much time elapsed between the two signals

 It lacks the depth of feeling due to absence of touching elements of the poetry of poetry
 The play of core words of alliteration, Yamak or Upma, metaphor, etc
, becomes important
 shabdon yaa arthon ko lekar khilwaad yaa vyaayaam hi yahan adhiktar abhipret he
 On these grounds, two distinctions of this poetic genre are considered - Vocabulary and Arthashachar

 However, Roshan finally feels relaxed in this place and wholeheartedly embraces the sense of community present here
 vah ramlila main apni daadi kaa saath detaa he, mamdu kii mithai kii dukaan par khadaa rahata he, bacchon ke saath kheltaa he or dhire dhire is sthaan kii samskruti main dub jaataa he
 Roshan also slowly comes into contact with some limited realities
 jab annapurna behosh ho jaati he or ve use jaldi se aspataal le jane kii koshish karte hai, us samay vah paata he ki sadak par trephic jam he, kyonki ek gaay vahaan bachhda de rahi hoti he, jise pavitra samaaroh maan kar log us gaay ke chaaron ore ikatthe ho jate hai; use baad main or bhi hairaani hoti he jab uski behosh daadi ko khinch kar log gaay kaa aashirwad dilaane ke liye le jate hai; or vah bhounchakka rah jaataa he jab sthaneey police logon ke is vyavhaar ko protsaahit karti he

 Inference is the definition of philosophy and logic
 bhartiya darshan main gyanprapti ke sadhano kaa naam pramaan hai
 Estimates are also a proof
 charvak darshan ko chhodkar praaia: sabhi darshan anumaan ko gyanprapti kaa ek saadhan maanate hai
 The knowledge gained through inference is named permissibility
 pratyaksh dwaara jis vastu ke astitv kaa gyaan nahin ho rahaa hai uskaa gyaan kisi aisi vastu ke pratyaksh gyaan ke aadhaar par, jo us apratyaksh vastu ke astitv kaa sanket is gyaan par pahunchne kii prakriya kaa naam anumaan he
 The simplest example of this process is as follows - seeing smoke rising across a mountain, the knowledge of the existence of fire there is permissible and the name of the process through which this knowledge originates
 yahan pratyaksh kaa vishay nahin he, keval dhuen kaa pratyaksh gyaan hota he
 But in the past with fire and smoke in many places, along with having direct knowledge, there has been a perception in the mind that wherever there is smoke, there is also fire
 ab jab ham keval dhuen kaa pratyaksh anubhav karte hai or hamako yah samaran hota he ki jahaan-jahaan dhuaan he vahaan-vahaan aag hoti he, to ham sochate hai ki ab hamako jahaan dhuaan dikhaai de rahaa hai vahaan aag avashya hogi: atev parvat ke us paar jahaan hamen is samay dhuen kaa pratyaksh gyaan ho rahaa he avashya hi aag vartmaan hogi
 The terms of the main organs of this type of process are: paashchaatya tarkshastra main anumaan kaa arth bhartiya tarkshastra main prayukt arth se kuch bhinn or vistrut hai
 The process of determining what sentences can be true on the basis of the truth of a single sentence or more than one sentence there is a presumption and the construction of the general statements based on the experience of special circumstances is also a guess
 is
 anumaan do prakaar kaa hota hai-- swaarth anumaan or pararth anumaan Self-esteem is a mental process in which the determination of the prevalence in your mind on the basis of repeated direct experience and then on the basis of impartial knowledge has emerged the permissibility of the existence of the practicable in your mind as it is
 But the permission of fire on the mountain is shown in knowledge
 yah samast prakriya apane ko samajhane ke liye apane hi man kii he
 But when we have to make sure of the existence of the practicable in favor of another person, then we reveal our occult in five organs, which are called components
 ve paanch avyav ye hai: Promise - means the statement of what you want to prove
 udhaaharan : parvat ke us paar aag he
 For - Why is such a presumption made, that is, to explain the presence of gender on the side
 udhaaharan : kayonki vahaan par dhuaan he
 Examples - Explain the use of parables by opposition and opposition, for example: Where there is smoke, there is fire, like in the stove and where there is no fire, there is no smoke, like in the pond
 
 upanay - yah batalaana ki yahan par paksh main aisa hi ling upasthit he jo saadhy ke astitv kaa sanket karata he
 Example: Smoke is also present here
 nigaman - yah siddh hua ki parvat ke us paar aag he
 In India, this altruism is used in philosophical and all other debates and debates
 yah yunaan desh main bhi prachlit tha or euklid ne jyamiti likhane main iskaa bhalee bhanti prayog kiya tha
 Aristotle also knew this
 bharat ke darshanikon or arestu ne bhi paanch avyavon ke sthaan par keval teen ko hi aavashyak samajha kyonki pratham or pancham avyav praaia: ek hi hai
 Upanayya is a mental activity that arises on its own in the mind when it comes to the front with prevalence and discrimination
 yadi samnevaala bahut mandabuddhi na ho, balki budhimaan ho, to keval pratigya or hetu in do avyavon ke kathan maatr kii aavashyaktaa he
 Therefore, the use of only two ingredients is found in the texts of Vedanta and Navya Nyaya
 bhartiya anumaan main aagaman or nigaman dono hi ansh he
 The knowledge of the existence of a practicable in a special situation on the basis of general prevalence is incorporation and the establishment of the scope is the arrival on the basis of direct experience of special circumstances
 purv prakriya ko paashchaatya deshon main didction or uttar prakriya ko induction kehete he
 Aristotle etc
 Western logicians thought a lot about incorporation and modern rationalists meditated on arrival
 bharat main vyapti kii sthapanaayen teen yaa teenon main se kisi ek prakaar ke pratyaksh gyaan ke aadhaar par hoti thim
 They are: kevalanvay, jab ling or saadhy kaa saahchary maatr anubhav main aata he, jab unka sah-abhaav na dekha ja saktaa ho
 The only difference when practicable and co-absence of sex and gender comes to experience, not companionship
 anvayavyatirek- jab ling or saadhy kaa sashastitv or sambhaav donon hi anubhav main aate hon
 John Stuart Mill, an Anglo-logician, gave a detailed description of the five processes of arrival in his texts
