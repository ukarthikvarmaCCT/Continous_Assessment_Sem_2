saamaanya hone ke in prayaason ke baavjood, UI ko spasht rup se pratispardhi companiyon ke bich vibhajit kiya gaya: jaise crystal yaa safaire Nokia the, quartz Ericsson tha
 DFRD was abandoned by Symbian in late 2002, part of an active withdrawal from UI development in favor of 'headless' distribution
 Nokia ko parl de diya gaya, UIQ praudyogiki AB ke rup main quartz ke vikaas ko vistaar diya gaya or japani companiyon ke saath kaam ko shighratham MOAP ke maanak tak sameta gaya
 First came in 2003
 It is an important Symbian release that appeared with all contemporary consumer interfaces including UIQ, such as Series 80, Series 90, Series 60, as well as many FOMA phones in Japan
 It also added Edge support and ipv6
 Java samarthan ko pjava or javapona se ek Java ME aadhaarit maanak main badla gaya
 In 2003, one million Symbian phones were imported in Q1 and it increased in late 2003 at the rate of one lakh per month

x ke saath adhik se adhik pasch sangatta or aanshik rup se communicator 9500 or uske purvavarti communicator 9210 ke bich sangatta hasil karne ke liye apanaaya gaya
 In 2004, Psion sold its stake in Symbian
 In the same year, the first mobile phone worm to use Symbian OS, Cabir, was developed, which uses Bluetooth to spread itself to nearby phones
 cabir or simbian OS khatra dekhen
 One of the many advantages of commercially shipping it for the first time in 2004 would have been the choice of two different colonels
 However, the EKA2 kernel version was not shipped until Symbian OS 8
1b
 These kernels behave more or less equally on behalf of the user, but they are intrinsically very different
 puraane upkaran chaalkon ke saath sangatta banaaye rakhane ke liye kuch nirmaataaon ne EKA1 ko chunaa, jabaki EKA2 ek real-time karnal tha
 In 2003 production of 8
0b was discontinued
 CDMA, 3G, do-tarafa data strimming, DVB-H or sadish graphicon or sidhe screen adhigam vaale opengl ES ko samarthan dene ke liye nae API ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 An improved version of 8

 In 2005, the first and perhaps most famous smartphone featuring the Symbian OS 8

 Released in early 2005
 It includes many new security-related features, such as the platform security module that facilitates mandatory code signing
 nae ARM EABI binary model kaa arth he ki vikasakartaaon ko ritul karne kii jarurat hogi or suraksha badlaav kaa matlab he ki unhen punaukutit karnaa ho saktaa he

 For example, file writing is a user-provided capability while accessing multimedia device drivers requires the approval of the phone manufacturer
 anuprayogon par hastakshar karne ke liye vikasakarta ke liye ek TC trustcentre ACS prakaashak ID praaanpatr kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 The Symbian Foundation was announced in June 2008, which came into existence in 2009
 iskaa uddeshy tha sampoorn simbian plateform ke liye strot ko prakashit karnaa jo OSI- or FSF dwaara anumodith eclips public license ke tahat ho
 simbian plateform ke anaavaran ne simbian OS ke swasampurna utpaada ko anuchit samajha
 The 100 millionth smartphone running the OS was shipped on 16 November 2006
 yatha 21 july 2009, simbian OS ko chalaane vaale 250 million upkarnon ko bheja gaya
 Symbian OS has been the victim of various viruses, of which Cabir was the most talked about
 Usually they spread from one phone to another via Bluetooth
 ab tak, kisi ne bhi simbian OS main kisi khami kaa laabh nahin liya he - iske bajaay, sabhi ne upyogkarta se poocha ki kya ve software sthapit karnaa chahenge, jiske saath unhone kuch chetavanee di ki is par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 However, with the idea that average mobile phone users should not worry about security, Symbian OS 9
x adopted a Unix-style capability model
 Theoretically installed software is not harmful without a digital signature - thus it can be tracked
 vanijyik vikasakarta jo laagat vahan kar sakate hai ve apane software ko Symbian Signed kaarykram ke madhyam se hastakshrit kara sakate hai
 Developers also have the option to self-sign their programs
 lekin, uplabdh suvidhaon main bluetooth, irda, GSM cellid, dhwani samvaad, GPS or kuch anya kaa abhigam shaamil nahin he
 Some operators have opted to deactivate all certificates other than the Symbian signed certificate
 kuch anya pratikul kaarykram neeche soochibaddh hai, lekin un sabhi ko chalane ke liye abhi bhi upyogkarta ke input kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 S60 v3 and v5 devices can be hacked to remove the platform security included in OS 9
1 onwards, thus allowing users to install "unsigned" files and access previously locked system files is
 yah oparating system ke kaary karne kii paddati ko badalane kii anumati detaa he or chhipe anuprayog aadi ko dekhne yogya banaata he or chunki ab oparating system fil khul chuki hai to virus ke mandaraate khatre ko bhi badha detaa he
 The native language of Symbian is c ++, although it is not a standard implementation
 simbian OS par aadhaarit kai plateform hai jinhone simbian OS upkarnon ko lakshya banane vaale anuprayog vikasakartaaon ke liye SDK uplabdh karaayaa - inamen se pramukh S60 or UIQ he
 Individual phone products, or families, often had an SDK or SDK extension that was also downloadable from the manufacturer's website
 simbian plateform main ekikrut vibhinn UI plateformon ke saath, 2010 ke baad se nirmaataaon ke SDK ke bich kam vividhta honi chahie
 The SDK includes documentation, requires header files and library files to build Symbian OS software, and a Windows-based emulator
 As of Symbian OS version 8, the SDK also includes a version of the GCC compiler, which is needed to build software to work on the device
 simbian OS 9 or simbian plateform ek nae ABI kaa upyog karte hai or inhen ek bhinn sankalak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he - GCC ke ek nae sanskaran sahit, apane pasand ke sankalak uplabdh hai 
 Unfortunately, Symbian c ++ programming has a deep learning curve, as Symbian requires the use of specialized technologies such as descriptors and a cleaning stack
 It can also make relatively simple programs difficult to implement in other environments
 iske alaava, yah sandigdh he ki simbian kii takneekein, jaise smriti prabandhan pratimaan, vastav main phydemand hote hai
 It is possible that these technologies, which were developed for more restrictive mobile hardware in the 1990s, simply caused unnecessary complexity in the source code as programmers needed to focus on low-level routines rather than application-specific features
 Was required
 haalanki or adhik ucch stareey or aadhunik programing pratimaan kii disha main kadam badhanaa mushkil lagata he
 Symbian c ++ programming is commonly done from the IDE
 simbian OS ke pichley sanskarnon ke liye, vanijyik IDE kodewarier ko simbian OS ke liye pasand kiya gaya
 kodewarier upkarnon ko 2006 ke dauraan Carbide
c++ se badal diya gaya, Nokia dwaara viksit ek eclips aadhaarit IDE
 Carbide
c++ ko chaar alag-alag sanskarnon main pesh kiya jaataa he: express, develper, profeshnal or OEM, badhati kshamta kram main
 purna visheshtaon vaale software ko express sanskaran dwaara banaaya or jari kiya ja saktaa he, jo muft he
 Features like UI design, crash debugging, etc
 are available in other paid versions
 Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 or 2005 bhi Carbide
vs plagain ke madhyam se samarthit hai
 The flavor of Symbian's c ++ is very special
 haalanki, simbian upkarnon ko Python, Java ME, Flash Lite, Ruby, 
NET, Web Runtime Widgets or Standard c / C++ ke prayog se programit kiya ja saktaa he
 
 Visual Basic vikasakarta, S60 3 sanskaran or UIQ 3 upkarnon ke liye anuprayog viksit karne ke liye NS Basic kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Visual Basic, VB
NET and c # development for Symbian was possible in the past by appforge Crossfire, a plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio
 13 march 2007 ko appforge kaa sanchaalan band ho gaya; Oracle ne bauddhik sampada kharid lee, lekin ghoshit kiya ki purv appforge utpaadon ko bechney yaa unhen samarthan pradaan karne kii unki koi yojana nahin he
 Net60, a 
NET Compact Framework for Symbian, developed by redfivelabs, was sold as a commercial product
 Net60, VB
NET and c # source code are compiled into an intermediate language that is implemented within the Symbian OS using a just-in-time compiler
 simbian OS ke liye borland IDE kaa ek sanskaran bhi he
 Development of Symbian OS is also possible on Linux and Mac OS X, using tools and technologies developed by the community, partially enabled by Symbian releasing source code for critical devices
 ek plagain jo simbian OS anuprayogon ko Mac OS x ke liye Apple ke Xcode IDE main vikaas karne kii anumati detaa he, uplabdh he
 Once developed, Symbian applications need to find a way to customers' mobile phones
 ve SIS fil main pek kiya jaataa he jise PC conect, bluetooth ke madhyam se over-da-air sthapit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa ek memory card par bhi
 ek vikalp he kisi phone nirmaataa ke saath bhagidaari karnaa or software ko phone par hi shaamil karvaa dena
 SIS fil maarg, simbian OS 9
x ke liye adhik mushkil he, kyonki koi bhi anuprayog jisamen nunatam se pare kshamtaaon kaa hona vaanchit he use Symbian Signed kaarykram ke madhyam se hastakshrit hona aavashyak he
 But it has different breaks, which are Symbian OS 9
x
 Allows to install unsigned programs with any capabilities in
 Symbian Signed pranali kaa parichay, jisamen anuprayog vikasakarta ko smartphone kii adhik aakarshak suvidhaon kaa upyog karne ke liye kuch bhugtan karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ise mukt strot pariyojnaon, swatantra vikasakartaaon or chote str ke shuruyaat karne waalon ke liye adhikadhik alokapriy plateform bana rahaa he
 This situation was further aggravated by fragmentation of the user interface system, meaning that developers needed to create and monitor multiple incompatible versions of their software if they wanted to target multiple devices that would have built-in similar Symbian
 Uses the OS version
 simbian OS ke liye Java ME anuprayog ko maanak takanic or upkaran kaa upyog karke viksit kiya ja rahaa he jaise Sun Java Wireless Toolkit unhen JAR filon ke rup main pack kiya jaataa he 
 CLDC or CDC, donon anuprayogon ko netbeans ke saath banaaya ja saktaa he
 Other tools include superwaba, which can be used to build Symbian 7
0 and 7
0s programs using Java
 Nokia S60i phone, jab S60 ke liye pithan dubhashiya sthapit ho to pithan script bhi chalaa saktaa he, jisamen hoga vishesh nirmit API jo bluetooth samarthan kii anumati detaa he
 It also has an interactive console that allows the user to write Python scripts directly from the phone

 It takes about two to three percent transaction fee to pay with a common debit / credit card, but bitcoin has nothing like this
 iske lenden main koi atirikt shulk nahin lagata he, is vajah se bhi yah lokapriy hota ja rahaa he
 Also it is safe and fast which is encouraging people to accept bitcoins

 As miners join our network, the way to find empty blocks for mining them will become even more difficult
 mining kaa kaam vahi log karte hai jo jinke paas ke paas vishesh gananaa vaale computer or gananaa karne kii uchit kshamta ho aisa nahin hone par mineras keval electricity hi kharch karegaa or apana samay barbaad karegaa
 The main objective of mining bitcoins is to secure the bitcoin node and keep the network away from tampering

 Gemology, or crystal science, is the study of the shape, properties and structure of crystals or crystals
 'crystal' greek bhashaa ke shabd crustalos se vyutpann he
 Crustalos originally means "snow", but the term later came to be used for rock crystals, a colorless translucent variety of quartz
 iske vishay main pracheen kaal main logon kii dharna thi ki yah atyadhik thand ke kaaran pani ke jamane se banataa he
 Shanai: Shanai: The word "crystal" came to be used for any mineral, which by nature is surrounded by simple faces
 yah shabd anguthi main jade janevaale ratnon tathaa anya aabhushanon ke liye prayukt nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki unamem jo suvyavasthit samtal falak dikhaai dete hai ve prakritik reeti se nahin bane hai, varan kritrim hai

 sachche crystal ke falak prakritik crystalan ke falswaroop banate hai, crystalan kriya chaahe bhupatal main hui ho yaa prayogshaala main
 In the second stage, matter and atmosphere are prepared by humans for the Kistalan, but the actual creation of the crystal and its specific facets develop without human intervention
 ye falak ek vishesh aantarik parmaanu sanrachana ke falswaroop nirmit hote hai
 The physical properties of crystals depend on this structure
 kaanch ke bane ek kritrim ratna main niyamit aantarik sanrachana nahin hoti he, at: bahya rup main crystal ke samaan hote hue bhi uski gananaa crystal main nahin kii jaati
 Thus, the true identity of a crystal is by the regular configuration of the atoms of its molecules

 Most minerals, which are formed under suitable conditions, are crystals
 kuch aise padaarth hai, jinhen ham taral crystal kehete hai
 Although there is evidence of regular atomic configuration, they are not true solids

 The more slowly the crystallization, the larger the crystals become

 Most of these well-developed crystal shapes, which are associated with internal molecular structure, are found
 inamen hira, laal, neelam, pann, pukhraj, amithist aadi ratna khanij vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 These crystalline minerals, which do not appear to have crystal figures, are grinded to extract thin fragments and tested by polarization microscope

 These crystals were considered to be definitely fluid in ancient times
 par ye madhyarupiy avasthaa main thos hi he
 The fluid nature seen in them, or the lack of firmness, is due to the weakness of the forces of the crystal, which are not powerful enough to maintain a certain geometric shape
 crystalki ko sabase pehali mahatvapurn dein denmarkwasi chikitsak nicholas stanon kii he
 In 1669, you told that some angles of a crystal are always equal, no matter how different the shape and size of the faces

 aapke kaary ke falswaroop antarafalak kone kii sthirataa kaa niyam, jisaki neenv 100 varsh purv stanon dwaara rakhi ja chuki thi, purna rup se sthapit ho gaya
 Although crystallologists were already hypothesizing about the possible internal structure of the crystal, a systematic description of this was first made by Abi Oui in 1784 AD
 crystal kii akruti se sambhddha vidalan kii satahon kaa nirikshan karte samay aapane yah vichaar sthapit kiya ki ek crystal sab se choti sambhav anu ekak kii punrariti se bana he
 The shape of this basic unit was assumed to correspond to the symmetry of that crystal
 isi ekak ke aadhaar par bhinn bhinn swabhaav ke crystalon kii rachana ho sakati thi, yadi chayan kii pragati ke saath saath kuch panktiyaan niyamit rup se chhod di jaatin
 Thus a heterogeneous dodecahedron can be formed from the unit of the cube if the "cube" at the edges is omitted when selecting the cube sample
 yahi ikai ek ashtafalak bana sakati he, yadi konon par se ghanakon kaa chayan chhod diya jaay
 On the basis of the relation of the complete crystal and its fundamental unit, Oui established the rule of "rational exponents", which is the most important law of crystals
 aui kii is khoj kii mahatta kaa anumaan isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhen crystalki kaa janmdata kaha jaataa he
 In 1830, based on Oui's rule of "rational exponents", Hazel discovered that 32 types of symmetries are possible in solid bodies with flat faces
 aapkaa kaary dirghakaal tak anjaane main hi padaa rahaa
 Independently, Gadolin Fon Lang also came to the same conclusion that Hazel had reached, and he fully established this fact in 1870 AD
 aui kii khoj ke pashchaat crystal kii aantarik sanrachana ke kaary main pragati hoti rahi or yah maan liya gaya ki brihat crystal kii sanrachana crystal kii aanvik ikai yaa bahuanvik ikaayiyon ke crystal dwaara ghire sthaan kii punrariti ke falswaroop hoti he
 The names of Seabar, Dena, Brewster, Delafoss etc
 are notable in this region

 Over the years many mathematicians and crystallologists have been searching for the different configurations by which crystals from different communities are made up of their unit cells

 They believed that 15 different configurations are possible

 Braves provided strong evidence for Frankenheim's stereoscopes and also showed that two of those 15 configurations are exactly the same
 usne in 14 trivimzalkon ko, jo crystal sanrachana kii neenv hai, saat samudaayon main vibhakt kar diya 
 Brevais also suggested that the geometric arrangement of atoms around the gravitational center of each molecule is the same
 duusare shabdon main, breves ke trivimzalak main prayek bindu kaa paryaavaran prayek duusare bindu ke paryaavaran ke samaan he or yah samaan rup se hi abhivinyast he
 The above point represents the center of gravity of the molecules
 yahi siddhant viner ne bhi swatantra rup se sthapit kiya
 Under the regularity of the arrangement of identical atoms, each such atom comes around which other atoms are arranged in the same manner
 usee varsh jordan ne crystalon kaa sandarbh na dekar, keval ganit ke aadhaar par yah pataa lagaaya ki tathakthith sarvatha sambhaagon kii niyamit aavriti kitne prakaar se sambhav he
 By following Weiner's theory and applying Jordan's method to crystals, Sohnke discovered that 65 points can be arranged in specific ways in the recess, while requiring only the same environment and not the same orientation, as in Bravis' stereoscope
 
 in 65 bindusamudaayon se aisi sanrachanaatmak vyavastha praapt hui jisase keval vibhinn samudaayon ke purnafalkeey varg kii hi nahin, jaisaa ki brevais trivimzalak main bhi thi, varan usase bhi neeche ke bahut se virgon kii samamiti praapt hui
 By incorporating reflection and inversion functions in the stereoscopic, Fedoroff, Schoenfleis, and Barlow studied 195 structural atomology systems independently and in various ways

 Now it became possible to understand the symmetry of the lower series

 Although the geometrical theory of crystal structure was successfully established at the end of the last century, crystal specialists were unaware of the size, measurement, and nature of the fundamental unit of the crystal
 ikaayiyon ko ab tak aui kaa ghan samaantarfalak, yaa fedoroff kaa samaatanr falak, samajha jaataa tha
 In the idea of pope and hair these multifaceted units are derived from condensed sets of elastic, but incompressible and deformable spheres

 Schibold devised a method in which the entire crystal is rotated in a main mantle and monochromatic radiation is applied to it

 By this method the dimensions of the unit cell of the crystal can be precisely measured
 is ghurnan vidhi main wisenvarg ne or sudhaar kiya
 The crystal is oscillated within a small angle range and the cylindrical camera rotates along the crystal in such a way that it stays with it at the time of exposure
 eks kiran vishleshan dwaara gyaat kii gai ikai koshika kii vimayein praaia: sabhi khanijon main crystal konemapi dwaara jane hue akshanupaat se mail khaati hai
 By x-ray analysis, we can fully know the structure of the crystal

 The crystal is surrounded by surfaces from all four sides

 Plaque is generally flat and smooth
 falak ek hi praroop yaa bhinn bhinn praroop ke ho sakate hai
 If all the panels are of the same type and are developed equally, then their geometric shapes are the same
 lekin inhen ek kism ke falkon kii akruti bhinn ho jaati he, yadi ve duusari kism ke falkon ke sangyojan main praapt hote hai
 All panels of the same type are members of a crystal form
 yah rup un falkon kaa jod he jinaki upasthiti us sthiti main crystal samamiti ke liye aavashyak hoti he jab ki unamem se koi ek upasthit ho
 The number of these faces depends on the crystal symmetry
 do sanlagn ko milaanevaali rekha ko crystal kaa kor kehete hai
 The corner where three or more faces meet is called Conia, which many authors call a cube angle
 bahufalak ke samaan crystal main bhi falak sankhya or konia kii sankhya kaa jod kor kii sankhya or do ke jod ke baraabar ho jaataa he
 The angle between the interface elements drawn on two faces in a crystal is called the angle of the interface
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhane kii he ki yah kone falkon ke bich ke vaastavik kone kaa poorak he
 This particular type of interface angle corresponds to the method of measuring angles
 yah ek ore ganitiya pariklan or duusari ore crystal ke falkon ke trivim nirupan or tadnantar goleey trikonmiti dwaara pariklan ke bhi anukool he
 To measure the interface angle of relatively large crystals, a contact crystal angiometer, made by Karangyo in 1870 AD, is used
 crystal main bahut se falak is prakaar vyavasthit ho sakate hai ki unki sataha, jahaan par ki sanlagn jode milte hai, samaantar hon
 The community of such faces is called Mandal
 vah kaalpanik rekha, jo crystal ke centre se hokar guzarati he tathaa jo koron ke samaantar hoti he, mandal aksh kehalaati he or vah samtal, jisamen mandal ke sabhi falkon ke abhilamb padate hai, mandaltal kehalaata he
 Plaques can be of one or several forms
 crystal ko kaagaj par pradarshit karne ke bahut se tareeke hai
 a straightforward and simple method is to draw a similar map of the crystal cores, as they appear from a point at a finite distance just above them
 do samaan drishy bhi pradarshit kiye ja sakate hai, pehla jaisaa ki saamne se dikhaai de or doosraa jaisaa ki dayee ore se dikhaai de
 These three views represent the foundation configuration of engineering, front hoisting and side hoisting respectively
 nirupan kii yah vidhi lambkoniya prakshep kehalaati he
 In gradient interpolation, the crystal is projected over a vertical plane
 isamen crystal ek aise bindu se dekha jaataa he, jo sabase upar ke falak, yaa konia, kii sataha se anant duuri par 9degree 28" tathaa dai ore 18degree 26" par hota he
 The faces of the crystals are arranged according to the symmetry determined schemes
 kuch aadhaar chinhon, kaa jinhen samamiti ke mul avyav kehete hai, adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 These components are as follows: yadi crystal main ek samamiti samtal upasthit he, to vah crystal ko do samroop tathaa baraabar bhaagon main is prakaar vibhajit karata he ki ek hissaa duusare kaa pratibimb hota he
 If the crystal has a symmetric axis, by rotating the crystal on that axis, the whole specified form of the crystal appears more than once, two, three, four times in a whole circle
 is drushti se samamiti aksh ko dvikoniya, trikoniya, chatushkoniya, yaa shatkoniya samamiti aksh kehete hai
 The crystals have to rotate 180 °, 120 °, 90 ° and 60 ° respectively for the above symmetry axes
 shatkoniya samamiti aksh se adhik kii aksheeya samamiti crystalon main sambhav nahin he
 And neither axonal axial symmetry is possible
 yadi crystal main samamiti centre upasthit he, to crystal ke ek bhaag main vidyaman ek konia, ek kor yaa ek falak kii sangat konia, kor yaa falak crystal ke vipareet bhaag main bhi vidyaman hota he
 In order to know the symmetry components and their properties in a crystal, the crystal is imagined free from irregularities resulting from uneven growth of homogeneous faces, as is usually the case in nature
 keval jyamitiya samamiti kii dasha main samamiti centre yaa ek samtal ke vipareet pashrv main vidyaman konia, kor yaa falak, samaan duuri par sthit hone chahie
 In this, the opposite faces are also of the same shape and form
 crystal sanrachanaatmak samamiti main antarafalak kone kii samamiti hi nishchayatmak avyav he, falkon kaa vistaar or akruti prakritik virupan ke kaaran mahatv nahin rakhte hai
 The reason for the deformation in the crystal is the purity of the solvents or the adversity in the growth speed, heat, or compression of the crystal
 yahi tathy crystal ke vishesh rup ko nishchit karte hai
 The particular form of the crystal is the result of the sum of the symptoms present and the relative expansion of the faces of each form
 crystal main vidyaman pradhan falak samashtiyon, athwa crystal main ek yaa do dishaao main adhik vikaas ke kaaran bananevaale prijmiya or sapaat roopon ke liye prayukt shabdon, ke saath ""vishesh rup"" shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Ancient workers made the rule of symmetry by thoroughly studying the characteristics of symmetry of the crystal
 yah sutara yaa niyam is prakaar he : ek crystal ke falak samamiti ke nishchit avyav ke anusaar sthit hote hai
 The position of the faces remains fixed for that crystal and on this depends its external appearance and physical properties
 pehle kaaryakartaaon ne bhi yah gyaat kiya tha ki ek padaarth ke crystal chaahe kitna hi vibhinn rup dikhalaayen, par unke sangat antarfalak kone kii sthirataa kaa mul sutara he
 Crystalline axes are imaginary lines that pass through the center of the crystal
 crystal ke falkon kii sthiti batalaane ke liye in kalpit rekhaon kaa upyog sandarbh akshon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Generally these axes are main symmetry axes, or parallel to some cores
 crystal ke swabhaav ke aadhaar par teen samamiti samatalon par abhilamb hote hai yaa crystal kii kuch yaa chaar aise aksh maan liye ja sakate hai
 It is not necessary that the axes are equal to each other, or bend equally to each other
 in akshon kii aapekshik lambaaiyon ko hi 'aksheeya anupaat' kehete hai
 They are mostly written by x, y, z
 inamen se y ko hi ikai maanane kii pratha he
 The relative distances at which the crystalline axes of the crystal pane intersect are called the intersecting proportions
 vah falak, jo akshon ko is prakaar katata he ki un duriyon kaa anupaat kramik akshon kii ikaayiyon ke anupaat ke samaan hota he, ekak falak, yaa paramitary samtal kehalaata he
 In order to determine the unit pane, only the most commonly found pane is chosen
 kisi bhi falak kaa aakaar, yaa pravanta unke ikai antarkhandon dwaara batalaai ja sakati he
 If a panel intersects a, b, c on the three axes x, y, z, then their relation can be represented by ax, by, cz according to Vice's method
 vaais kii parameter vidhi ke sthaan par ghaataank vidhi, jise sabase pehle miller ne lokapriy banaaya, adhik prachlit he
 If the inverse or exponent of this method is in fraction, it is used to multiply and convert them into whole numbers
 at: yadi ek falak, x aksh ko ekak duuri se dugane sthaan par or y ko tiguni duuri par, katata he tathaa z ke samaantar he, to iskaa vaais chihn 2 x, 3 y, ¥ z hoga
 Their derivatives will be 1 / 2, 1 / 3 1 / 4
 6 se guna karne par yah 3, 2, 0 ho jayega
 Hence the millerchir of this panel will be written 3, 2, 0 and it will be read three, two, zero

 In the middle brackets, it denotes the entire form of the {3 2 0} pane and in larger brackets it denotes a circle
 crystalki kii sabhi vidhiyon, goniometary pathan, trivimiya prakshep tathaa ganitiya pariklan ke liye milan chihn mahatvapurn he
 It has been known from experience that normally only those panels in a crystal have axial integuments, which are minor, or infinite, of the unit
 isi prakaar miller ghaataank saral parimey sankhya yaa shunya hote hai
 This is called the rational exponential rule
 isamen aise ghaataank jaise 20

 To explain different types of crystals, different positions of crystalline axes are imagined to be convenient
 inkaa chah crystal samudaayon main vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 The interpretation of each community depends on the form of the axes
 in chah samudaayon main se paanch main akshon kii sankhya teen teen hai tathaa chathe main upyog ke vichaar se teen kii apeksha chaar aksh adhik suvidhajanak gyaat hue hai
 The diversity of communities depends on the same or uneven bending of the axes and the intersecting proportions being the same or unequal on the different axes of the unit pane
 teenon akshon ko is prakaar abhivinyast kiya jaataa he ki tathakthith l aksh udagr rahata he, r prekshak ke samantaravaale udagr samtal main sthit rahata he or teesraa ya aksh prekshak ke sanmukh rahata he
 The upper, right and front ends of L, r and z respectively are called money and their opposite ends are called debt
 yadi kisi falak dwaara kisi aksh kaa rinbhaag ant:khandit hota he, tab usase sambandhit milatar ghaataank ke upar rin kaa chihr bana diya jaataa he
 In Trinitaksha community, all the three axes, circles are of uneven lengths and are inclined at each other, making oblique angles
 eknataksh samudaay main ya, r, l asmaan hai
 y and l make oblique angles to each other, but r lies perpendicular to the plane in which y and l are
 vishamalambaaksh samudaay main ya, r l asmaan hai, lekin ek duusare par samaan rup se jhuke hue hai
 The hexagonal community consists of three equal horizontal axes Y1, Y2, Y3, which intersect each other at an angle of Rs 60 and the fourth axis l is uneven and perpendicular to the plane of the first three axes
 chatushkoniya samudaay main do samaan kshaitij aksh ya1 or ya2 ek duusare par samakon banaate hai or udagr aksh l asmaan he
 The three axes of the Trismalambaksha community are similar and form a right angle to each other
 ya1, ya2 kshaitij hai or ya3 udagr he
 Such forms are found in different crystals of the same community, which appear to be identical from the point of view of the crystalline axis, but differ on the number of their faces and the symmetry of symmetric elements
 vastav main inamen se kuch purna yaa purnafalkeey rup hai, jinamein us samudaay kii purna samamiti ke liye aavashyak sabhi samtal vidyaman rahete hai
 Some of these forms are partial, such as semicircular and quadrangular figures
 ardhafalakeey akritiyon main usee samudaay kii purnafalkeey akritiyon ke aadhe falak or chaturthanshfalakeey akritiyon main ek chauthai falak vidyaman rahete hai
 Apart from this, there is also another partial form, which is called the Ardhakriti form
 isamen ek purnafalkeey crystal ke aadhe falak crystal ke keval ek hi ore kendrit hote hai, yaa ban jate hai, shesh aadha bhaag yaa to anupasthit rahata he, yaa vahaan par duusare rup kaa aadha bhaag nirupati rahata he
 Associated with any community, these forms are of lower grade symmetry than the full-fledged form of that community
 at: kisi bhi samudaay ke crystal bhinn bhinn samamiti virgon ke antargat aate hai
 Symmetry classes are named based on the most common form of that class
 samamiti ke sabhi sambhavya sanmilan par saidhantik rup se vichaar kar, samamiti ke 32 varg nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai
 Generally only 11 of these are found in minerals, the other 13 are rare in minerals and artificial crystals and the other 6 are found only in artificial crystals
 shesh do or abhi bhi anirupit hai
 The forms are given certain general names based on the positions of the faces associated with the crystalline axes
 pinecoid main unke rachak falak keval ek hi crystalia aksh ko katate hai tathaa donon ke samaatanr hote hai
 The panels of the prism are parallel to the vertical axis and intersect the other two axes
 dom ke falak udagr aksh or ek pashrv aksh ko katate hai tathaa duusare parshv aksh ke samaatanr hote hai
 The panes of the pyramid intersect all axes
 crystal prakruti main saamanyat: nahin dikhaai padate hai or na prayogshaala main hi unka bananaa saral he
 Mostly they are found in aggregates, which are homogeneous, or heterogeneous, in which the sum of different crystals varies
 samaangi samucchy main bahudhaa crystalon kaa samaantar vikaas dikhalaai padataa he, jaise fitkaree, tanba, hematite or him main
 Sometimes the separation is partial, as in the Yamal crystals
 bahuteron main to samaantaran bilkul hi nahin dikhaai detaa
 In these, the crystalline units are disordered and thus form an "irregular set"
 isi prakaar "vishmangi samucchy" main bhi lagbhag purna samaantaran ho saktaa he jhrjaisa samakritik vruddhi ment yaa aanshik samaantaran ho saktaa he, yaa samaantaran kaa purna abhaav ho saktaa he
 Yamal crystals have two or more crystals connected together in such a way that a part is made up of the reflection of the enclosed part
 aisa prathit hota he ki yamal crystal kaa ek bhaag apni moulik sthiti se aksh ke upar 180rou ghumaya gaya he
 The above-mentioned reflection plane is equally related to both parts of the Yamal crystal, but this plane is not the symmetric plane of either of those two parts
 yahi kalpit samtal yamal samtal or aksh yamal aksh kehalaata he
 These two form right angles at each other
 vah samtal jahaan par do sanlagn bhaag aapas main mili rahete hai sanmilan tal kehalaata he
 In most cases, it is Yamal level
 sansparsh yamalon main ek spasht sanmilan tal hota he, jaise orthoklez spinel or caceterite main
 But no such level is seen in the intrusive Yamal, such as storolite, fluorite and pyrite
 pichley udhaaharan main crystal paraspar antarvenshi hote hai
 Recurring Yamals are formed from three or more crystals
 isi ke antargat aate hai, bahusanshleshi yamal tathaa chakree yugma
 In multispectral Yamal, successive concordance planes are parallel, as in albite, and cyclic pairs do not have parallel surfaces, as in rutile
 chakree yamal ke dwaara nichi shrenee kii samamiti ke crystal kabhi kabhi apekshaakrit unchi shrenee kii samamiti ke crystalon kaa anukaran karte hai
 The reason for the polymerization in crystals is the lack of complete separation of molecules, which is due to the lack of proper time for the molecules in the process of crystallization
 chakree yamalon main yamalan crystalon kii ucch samamiti praapt karne kaa asafal prayaas hi prathit hota he
 The internal molecular arrangement of a crystal depends not only on its external appearance but also on its physical properties
 inamen se kuch gun to crystal kii pratirohak shakti se gyaat hote hai, jab use todaa, khurcha yaa jhukaaya jaataa he
 Other properties of crystals are related to light and heat, and to magnets and electrodes
 gailena, pirit, kailcite tathaa anya bahut se khanijon ke crystal nishchit samtal satahon par se, jo crystal ke sambhavya falak yaa falkon ke samaantar hoti hai, tuutate hai
 This property is called Vidalan
 isse gyaat hota he ki sasanjak bal kuch dishaao main anya dishaao kii apeksha durbal hai
 Crystals that do not have a cleavage surface are fractured
 yah vibhang shankhabh hota he, arthath sataha tuutane par chikani tathaa natodar hoti hai, yaa assam ho sakati he
 Crystals are mostly brittle, meaning they can be broken into small pieces easily, or their powder can be made easily
 crystalia akruti kii dhaatuon main se kuch, jaise sona, chaandi, tanba, aghatvadhry hai, arthath hathode se petakar inaki chadar taiyaar kii ja sakati he
 Some are perforated, ie can be cut into thin sheets, while others are tensile, ie their strings can be pulled
 kuch crystal, jaise chlorite, namya hote he, jabaki anya, jaise abhrak, pratyasth hote hai
 The resistance that a crystal exhibits in the scraper is called its hardness
 bhinn bhinn kathorta ke das prakaar ke crystalon se ek maapak taiyaar kiya gaya he, jisaki sahaayta se crystal kii kathorta kii sankhya batalaai jaati he
 To know the hardness of the crystal on this scale, it is seen that which of the ten scraps the crystal
 sabase komaltam crystal talk kaa tathaa sabase kathor heere kaa he
 The scale has approximately equal intervals up to 9
 hira, jisaki is paimaane par apekshaakrit kathorta 10 he, nirpeksh maap ke hisaab se 42
4 he
 Hence there is a relatively large gap between 9 and 10
 kuch crystalon main dishaao ke saath saath kathorta badalati rahati he
 This is due to the difference in internal molecule
 yah badi rochak baat he ki graphite kii, jiskaa rasinic sanghatan heere ke samaan he, kathorta do se bhi kam he
 a particular type of internal molecular arrangement of crystals is manifested in depositional shapes
 nikshaaran akritiyaan crystal ke falkon par kisi uchit vilaayak kii kriya ke falswaroop nirmit hoti hai
 The symmetry of these shapes corresponds to the molecular structure below
 ye akritiyaan chote-chote gadadhon yaa avanaman ke rup main hoti hai tathaa nishchit jyamitiya akruti kii hoti hai or dhalwaan samatalon se ghiri rahati hai
 Some properties of crystals depend on light
 crystal kii chamak uski sataha se paravartit prakaash kii maatra or gun par hi nirbhar he
 The brightest visible light from the opaque crystals of a metallic compound is called radiant
 yadi yah apekshaakrit kam chamakdaar hai, to ise dhatmik kehete hai
 According to these, for the translucent and non-metallic crystals, the terms Hirakasam and Kachabha are used respectively
 anya saamaanya chamak reshmi, rezini, motiyaa, chikani, yaa dhyutiheen kehalaati he
 The crystal is not always the same in different inverting samples
 ek dhaatu crystal main, jiskaa rang gaharaa hota he, uske kas kaa adhyayan karnaa laabhakaari hota he
 The color of the powder can be seen by rubbing the crystals on the surface of an unbleached sugar clay
 prakaash kii sanchaar karne kii kshamta ke aadhaar par crystal paardarshak, alpapaardarshak tathaa apaardarshak hota he
 Some crystals exhibit polymorphism, ie different colors in different conditions
 aisa bhinn bhinn crystalia dishaao main sanchaarit prakaash ke varanatmak avasorana ke kaaran hota he
 Light gets refracted from the air medium to an opaque crystal, that is, it changes its direction in proportion to the damping velocity
 vaayu tathaa crystal main prakaash ke veg kii nishpatti ko hi crystal kaa apvartanaank kehete hai
 Crystals of gemstone minerals are so much brighter and more attractive due to their higher refractive index
 heere kii chamak uske ucch apvartanaank 2
419, ke hi kaaran he, jabaki fluorite kii kachabh chamak uske nimna apvartanaank, 1
434, kii dyotak he
 The refractive index of water is 1
33 and the refractive index of crown glass is 1
53
 trisamalambaaksh samudaay ke prayek crystal kaa apvartanaank sabhi dishaao main samaan hota he
 Thus, such crystals are isosceles
 anya samudaayon ke crystal vishamdaishik hote hai
 When a ray of light enters an anisotropic crystal it splits into two rays and thus bi-refraction occurs
 donon kirane bhinn bhinn veg se chalati hai tathaa apni yatra kii bhinn bhinn dishaao main bhi ye badalati rahati hai
 Crystals of tetragonal and hexagonal communities do not undergo refraction in one direction, ie in the direction of the vertical crystalline axis
 prakashkeey drushti se aise crystalon ko ekakshiya kaha jaataa he
 There is no refraction in two directions in Vishalambaksha, Ekantaksha and Trinataksha crystals
 at: aise crystalon ko prakaashat: dwi-aksheeya kehete hai
 These two directions, called optical axes, do not match the crystal structural axes, but they lie in a plane with maximum and minimum velocity directions
 adhiktam or nunatam vegavaali dishaao main se ek prakaashiya aksh ke laghukon ko tathaa duusari brihadkon ko ardhit karti he
 Some crystals are inherently fluorescent
 ye pisane par, khurachne par, yaa malane par, yaa laal taap se neeche tak garam karne par andhere main prakaash phekate hai
 These crystals, which begin to glow in darkness upon invagination in invisible radiation, such as ultraviolet light or x rays, or cathode rays, are called fluorescent
 yadi vikiran kaa strot hataane ke baad bhi crystal main chamak bani rahati he, to use sfurdipt crystal kehete hai
 Some crystals, which have higher atomic weight elements, are radioactive
 inkaa badi teji se tathaa ek samgati se vighatan hota rahata he
 Elements, such as radium, uranium, thorium, decompose to refract into helium and lead and emit energy in the form of radiation, which can be conveniently detected by an instrument called the Geiger counter
 vah taap jisapar bhinn bhinn crystal pighalate hai, vistrut seemaa main vichrata hai
 Some crystals are fusible in a flame of flame and some do not melt in it
 aapekshik galaniyata chah khanijon kii galaniyata-maapak ke aadhaar par nishchit kii ja sakati he
 The liquids of these minerals range from 525 ° c to 1,400 ° C, while the heat of a good blow flame goes up to 1,500 ° C
 kuch crystalon main taap parivartan karne par unke vibhinn bhaagon main ek hi saath dhan or rin vidyut utpann ho jaati he
 Even under the influence of compression, money and debt are produced in different layers of the crystal
 inamen se pratham ghatana ko tapavidyut tathaa duusari ghatana ko dabavidyut kehete hai
 It is very interesting that this phenomenon is found only in crystals that fall into symmetry classes that do not have symmetry centers
 quatrge or tourmaileen iske saamaanya udhaaharan he
 In modern times, pressurized crystals are used in radio and acoustics
 ve crystal, jinamein loha hota he, saamanyat: chumbakeey hote hai, kuch bina lohe vaale crystal bhi alp yaa mand chumbakeey hote hai
 Of these, only magnetite and pirotite are attracted by a simple placenta or penal magnet
 inke atirikt bahut se aise crystal hai, jo vidyut chumbak dwaara aakarshith kiye jate hai
 Apart from these, there are many, which are attracted in different order by electromagnet, thus it becomes easy to separate them from each other
 jab ek rasinic padaarth crystal kaa rup dhaaran karata he, tab parmaanu, jisase anu banate hai, tathaa anu ek nishchit praturup main vyavasthit rahete hai
 The crystal structure is usually the identity of the compound

29611 The supernatural joy found in the recitation of audible poetry or the philosophy of listening and visual poetry and listening to poetry is called rasa in poetry
 ras se jis bhav kii anubhuti hoti he vah ras kaa sthaayee bhav hota he
 Rasa, verses and ornamentation - are essential components of poetic composition
 ras kaa shabdic arth he - nichod
 The joy of poetry is the juice of poetry

 Ras is the power of conscience, due to which the senses perform their work, the mind imagines, the memory of the dream remains
 ras anand rup he or yahi anand vishaal kaa, viraat kaa anubhav bhi he
 This same pleasure is the transcendence of all other experiences

 ras nau hai - Vatsalya Ras is considered to be the tenth and Bhakti is also considered to be the eleventh juice
 vatsal tathaa bhakthi inke sthaayee bhav hai
 Bhakti Rasa is considered to be the 11th Rasa
 This rasa has been established in the scripture "bhakti Rasa- Pahla Rasa or Eleventh Rasa" written by Vivek Sahni
 
 In the Natyasastra, Bharata Muni, while explaining Rasa, has said - arthath vibhaav, anubhav, vyabhichaari bhav ke sanyog se ras kii nishpatti hoti he
 It is said in the well-known literature mirror that when the permanent sense of the heart attains a combination of affect, feeling and communicable feeling, it disappears in the form of rasa
 reetikaal ke pramukh kavi dev ne ras kii paribhaasha in shabdon main kii he : Thus there are four parts of rasa - Permanent feeling, Vibhava, Anubhav and communicative feeling
 bhav kaa arth he:-hona In the conscience of the heart, the psyche which is always present in the form of lust or sanskar and which no opponent or antagonist can suppress, is called permanent emotion
 ye maanav man main beej rup main, chirkaal tak achanchal hokar nivas karte hai
 These represent the sacrament or spirit
 ye sabhi manushyon main usee prakaar chhipe rahete hai jaise mitti main gandh avichhinn rup main samaai rahati he
 They are so capable that they merge with other emotions
 inaki sankhya 11 he - rati, haas, shok, utsaah, krodh, bhay, jugupsa, vismay, nirved, vatsaltaur ishwar vishyak prem
 Vibhava means reason
 ye sthaayee bhaavon kaa vibhaavan / udbodhan karte hai, unhen aswaad yogya banaate hai
 These are considered fundamental in the origin of juice
 vibhaav ke do bhed hai: The main emotion or object due to which the emotion originates is called poetic reception
 alamban ke antargat aate hai vishay or aashray
 The character towards which a character's feelings are awakened is the subject
 sahitya shaastra main is vishay ko alamban vibhaav athwa 'alamban' kehete hai
 The character in which the emotions are awakened is called the shelter
 sthaayee bhav ko jaagrath rakhane main sahaayak kaaran uddipan vibhaav kehalaate hai
 As an example, the enemy standing standing in front of the zeal of Veer Ras is enthusiasm
 shatru ke saath sena, yuddh ke baaje or shatru kii darpoktiyaan, garjana-tarjana, shastr sanchaalan aadi uddipan vibhaav hai
 There are two types of stimulus effects: arthath alamban kii uktiyaan or cheshthaayen That is, objects related to the environment
 prakritik drishyon kii gananaa bhi inhen ke anrtgat hoti hai
 The gestures of shelter that illuminate or convey permanent expressions like Rati, Haas, Mourning etc
 are called Anubhav
 ye cheshtaaen bhav-jagriti ke uparaant aashray main utpann hoti hai isliye inhen anubhav kehete hai, arthath jo bhaavon kaa anugaman kare vah anubhav kehalaata he
 Anubhav has two distinctions - the intended and the unwilling
 alamban evam uddipan ke madhyam se apane-apane kaarnon dwaara utpann, bhaavon ko baahar prakashit karne vaali saamaanya lok main jo kaary cheshtaaen hoti hai, ve hi kavy naatak aadi main nibaddh anubhav kehalaati hai
 For example, filling the sighs by the Viraha-distraught hero, watching with tears, sweat, thrill, affection in the spirit of union, handling of arms when awakened, harsh speech, red eyes, etc
 will be called Anubhav
 saadhaaran anubhav : arthath ke chaar bhed hai

 Satvik
 aashray kii sharir sambandhi cheshtaaen angik yaa kayik anubhav he
 Earthly deflection, sarcasm etc
 are the rhetorical rhetorical experiences when the Rati Bhava is awake
 aropit yaa kritrim vesh-rachana aharya anubhav he
 But, in the wake of permanent feeling, natural, unnatural, ayatnaj, angvikar are called satvik experiences
 iske liye aashray ko koi bahya cheshtaa nahin kerani padati
 Hence they are called Ayatnaj
 ye swat: pradurbhoot hote hai or inhen roka nahin ja saktaa
 Satvik Anubhav: meaning there are eight distinctions - pillar, Sveda, thrill, Swarbhang, Vepathu, Vaivarnya, Tear and Pralaya
 jo bhav keval thodi der ke liye sthaayee bhav ko pusht karne ke nimitt sahaayak rup main aate hai or turant lupt ho jate hai, ve sanchari bhav hai
 The word sanchari means, to walk together, that is, to be transitive, communicable emotions are transmitted with a permanent emotion, they are capable enough that they can move in harmony with each permanent emotion
 isliye inhen vyabhichaari bhav bhi kaha jaataa he
 The number of communicable or adulterous expressions is considered 33 - Nirveda, guilt, doubt, Asuya, item, labor, laziness, lowliness, anxiety, fascination, memory, dhriti, vriada, chatliya, joy, impulse, inertia, pride, grief, sadness , Sleep, aphasma, dream, prabodh, amarsha, avhitha, raging, mati, disease, hysteria, death, tragedy and disarray
 bharatmuni ne kavy ke aavashyak tatv ke rup main ras kii pratishtha karte hue shringaar, hasya, raudra, karun, vir, adbhut, bibhats tathaa bhayanak naam se uske aath bhedon kaa spasht ullekh kiya he tathaa katipay panktiyon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon kii kalpana he ki unhone shant naamak nawein ras ko bhi sweekruti di he
 Navaras is the noun of these nine juices
 vibhavanubhav-sancharibhav ke sanyog se in rason kii nishpatti hoti he
 The permanence of each juice is different
 usee kii vibhavadi sanyog se paripurna honevaali nirvighn-pratiti-grahya avasthaa ras kehalaati he
 Sringar's permanent rite, humor humor, raudra's wrath, Karun's grief, valor's excitement, wonder of wonder, jugupsa of beauty, fear of terrible and permanent sham of calm or nirvade
 bharat ne aath rason ke devtaa kramash: vishnu, pramath, rudra, yamraj, indra, brahma, mahakaal tathaa kaldev ko mana he
 Narayana, the god of quiet juice, and his character Kundetu are said to be
 pratham aath rason ke kramash: shyaam, sit, rakt, kapot, gaur, pit, nil tathaa krishna varna maane gaye hai
 Bharata has considered the origin of humor, compassion, wonderful and terrible rasa in the first eight rasas, considering Shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatsa as the principal
 shringaar kii anukriti se hasya, raudra tathaa vir karm ke parinamswaroop karun tathaa adbhut evam vibhats darshan se bhayanak utpann hota he
 Anukriti means Abhinavagupta's words, so the feel of any juice can be productive of humor
 vikrut veshalankaradi bhi hasyotpadak hote hai
 The work of Rādra is destruction, hence the doer of Karun and the performer of heroic work are often seen doing unpardonable actions, so it seems natural to originate from him
 isi prakaar bibhatsadarshan se bhayanak kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 Smashanadi's philosophy alone is frightening
 tathaapi yah utpatti siddhant atyantik nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki parapaksh kaa raudra yaa vir ras swapaksh ke liye bhayanak kii sristi bhi kar saktaa he or bibhatsadarshan se shant kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation in detail with the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 Raso's king Shringar Ras is considered vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished
 Huh
 "kavyprakash" kaa virahahetuk nayaa he or shaapahetuk bhed pravaas ke hi antargat gruhit ho saktaa he, "sahityadarpan" main karun vipralambh kii kalpana kii gai he
 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha
 "alankarikoustubh" main sheeghra nasht honevaale tathaa shobhit na honevaale raag ko "haridr" naam se chauthaa bataaya he, jise unka tikaakar "shyamaraag" bhi kahata he
 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilasha, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of himself and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the epithet, the greatness
 And with a slight change in Saraswati Kantharan and poetry, Chakshupriti, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between adornment and humor and Karun Rasa was calculated before Rudra
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit
 bibhats bharat tathaa dhananjay ke anusaar shuddh, kshobhan tathaa udayegi naam se teen prakaar kaa hota he
 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Quiet ragas-malice is both inclusiveness and metaphysics, in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible
 isi prakaar "anmarsh" ko vir kaa sthaayee maananaa bhi uchit nahin, kyonki amarsh ninda, apmaan yaa akshepadi ke kaaran chitt ke abhinivesh yaa swabhimanavbodh ke rup main prakat hota he, kintu viraras ke dayavir, daanveer, tathaa dharmaveer naamak bhedon main is prakaar kii bhaavana nahin rahati

 rameshwaram keval dharmik mahatv kaa tirth hi nahin, prakritik saundarya kii drushti se bhi darshneey he
 a train from Madras delivers passengers to Rameshwaram in about twenty two hours
 raste main pamban stesan par gaadi badalani padati he

 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is the extract of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of three qualities — trio called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world
 gita press gorakhpur jaisi dharmik sahitya kii pustakon ko kaaphi kam mulya par uplabdh karaane vaale prakaashan ne bhi kai aakaar main arth or bhashya ke saath shrimadbhagavadgita ke prakaashan dwaara ise aam janata tak pahunchane main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
