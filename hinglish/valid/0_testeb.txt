 To do so, he had planned to throw a bomb in Delhi Central Assembly
 bhagat singh chaahate the ki isamen koi khun kharaba na ho or angrejon tak unki 'awaz' bhi pahunche
 Although initially not everyone in his party thought so, in the end, the names of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt were unanimously chosen

 Mahatma Gandhi spoke to the Viceroy on 17 February 1931 to pardon the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, then on 18 February 1931, on behalf of the general public, also filed an appeal before the Viceroy for forgiveness with various arguments
 yah sab kuch bhagat singh kii ichha ke khilaaf ho rahaa tha kyon ki bhagat singh nahin chaahate the ki unki sajaa maaf kii jaae

 Fearing this, the British threw half of their dead bodies into the Sutlej River and ran away

 And Bhagat Singh became immortal forever

 His thoughts are reflected from his letters and articles written during his jail time
 unhone bhartiya samaaj main lipi, jati or dharm ke kaaran aayi duriyon par dukh vyakt kiya tha
 He also thought of the attack of an Indian on the weaker section of society in the same manner as the atrocities committed by an Englishman
 bhagat singh ko hindi, urdu, punjabi tathaa angreji ke alaava bangla bhi aati thi jo unhone batukeshwar dutt se sikhi thi
 He believed that his martyrdom would cause the Indian public to become more agitated and this could hardly happen with his life

 In a letter sent to his brother Kulatar on March 3, before hanging, Bhagat Singh wrote - unhen yah fikr he hardam, nayi tarz-e-zafaa kya he? hamen yah shauk he dekhen, sitam kii intahaa kya he? Why should you be upset with the poison, what should be done of the wheel

 macrophesso, tii limphocites, bi limphocites or fibroblast ve koshikaayen hai jo milakar grenuloma banaate hai jabaki limphosite, sankramit macrophesso ke chaaron ore hoti hai
 Granulomas inhibit the proliferation of mycobacteria and provide a local environment for the interplay of cells of the immune system
 jeevanu, grenuloma ke andar niskriy ho jate hai, jiske parinamswaroop avyakt sankraman hota he
 The development of abnormal cell death at the center of the tubercle is another feature of granuloma
 nagn ankhon se dekhne par, yah naram, safed paneer kii banaavat jaisaa hota he or casius necrosis kaha jaataa he
 If TB bacteria enter the bloodstream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and form multiple centers of infection, all of which appear as small, white tubercles in the tissues
 yah tibi rog kaa ek gambhir rup he jo chote bacchon or echivi peedit logon main sabase adhik aam he, ise milliyari tapedic kaha jaataa he
 People suffering from this TB have a high mortality rate despite treatment

 Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis
 prabhavit utak kaa sthaan chakatte or khaali jagah le leti he jo casial necrotic saamagree se bhari hoti he
 During active disease, some of these empty airways are connected to the bronchi and this material can come out in the form of phlegm
 inamen jivit bacteria hote hai, isaliye sankraman fail saktaa he
 Treatment with appropriate antibiotics can kill bacteria and make treatment possible
 thik ho jane par, prabhavit kshetra antat utakon dwaara pratisthapit ho jate hai
 Active tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose only on the basis of signs and symptoms, similarly diagnosing disease in people with weak immunity is difficult
 halanki tibi kaa nidaan un logon main kiya janaa chaiye jinamein fefdon ke rog ke chihn he yaa do se adhik saptaah se swaabhaavik lakshan hai
 Chest X-rays and several sputum cultures for acid fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation

 Blood tests performed to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended

 Those who are already immune may receive a false positive test result

 The prevention and control of tuberculosis is mainly dependent on vaccination of newborns and appropriate treatment of active cases
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke sanshodhit upachaar pathya ke madhyam se kuch safalataa hasil hui he or maamalon kii sankhya main thodi si kami aayi he
 The only available vaccine in 2011 is Bacillus calmette-guérin, which is effective in childhood disease and provides inconsistent protection against lung TB

 However, the immunity provided by it begins to decline after ten years

 Because of the tuberculin skin test being falsely positive, the use of the vaccine is argued against and, therefore, is of no use in screening

 The World Health Organization declared TB a "global health emergency" in 1993, and in 2006 the Stop TB Partnership developed a global plan to prevent tuberculosis that aims to save 14 million lives between its beginnings to 2015

 The tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is being used primarily in public health programs
 tibi ke upachaar main antibiotic dawaaon kaa upyog karke bacteria ko maaraa jaataa he
 Effective TB treatment is difficult due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacteria cell wall, which inhibits the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective
 do sabase adhik istemaal kii jane vaali antibiotic dawaayein isoniyazid or riffampisin hai or upachaar, lambey samay kaa ho saktaa he jisame kai mahine lag sakate hai
 An antibiotic is commonly used in the treatment of latent TB, while a combination of several antibiotics is used in active TB disease to reduce the risk of bacteria developing antibiotic resistance
 avyakt sankramanon se peedit logon ko baad main jivan main sakriy tibi rog ke viksit hone se bachaav ke liye bhi upachaar diya jaataa he
 Direct treatment, ie a healthcare provider, takes care that people take their medicines

 The evidence in support of this case is weak when compared to this practice and people taking the medicines on their own independently
 lekin upachaar ke mahatv ko, logon ko yaad dilaane ke tareeke prabhavi dikhaai dete hai
 In 2010, a suggested six-month treatment of newly started pulmonary tuberculosis used a combination of antibiotics like rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isonizid in the subsequent four months
 
 jin maamalon main isoniyazid ke liye ucch pratirodh hota he, unamem baad ke chaar maahon main athembuttol joda ja saktaa he
 If tuberculosis occurs again, before determining treatment it should be tested to determine which antibiotic it is sensitive to
 yadi ek se adhik dawa pratirodhi tibi kaa pataa chalaa he to 18 se 24 maheenon ke liye kam se kam chaar prabhavi antibiotic dawaaon ke saath upachaar kii sifarish kii jaati he
 Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a stress resistant to TB

 Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is long and requires more expensive drugs
 emdiar tibi ko sarvaadhik prabhavi, pehali pankti kii tibi dawaaon riffampisin or isoniyazid ke prati pratirodhi ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Largely drug resistant TB is also resistant to three or six classes of second-line drugs

 Progression to TB disease manifested by TB infection occurs when bacilli overcomes the defense of the immune system and begins to increase numbers

 However, in most cases, a latent infection has no obvious symptoms

 The risk of reactivation increases with immune deficiency, such as in HIV infection

 Studies using M
 Tepadik's DNA finger printing show that re-infection in recurrent TB contributes more adequately to earlier thinking, estimating it to be reactivated in common areas of TB
 Contributes to more than 50% of cases

 parantu ek american professor ke prayaas se unhen thodaa samay mila
 All the scholars were surprised to hear his views in that council
 phir to america main unka atyadhik swaagat hua
 There became a large community of his devotees
 teen varsh ve america main rahe or vahaan ke logon ko bhartiya tatvagyan kii adbhut jyoti pradaan kii
 Given his oratory style and knowledge of the media there Saiclonik Hindu named him
 "aadhyatm-vidya or bhartiya darshan ke bina vishwa anaath ho jaayegaa" yah swami vivekananda kaa drudh vishwaas tha
 In the US, he established several branches of the Ramakrishna Mission
 anek amareeki vidwaanon ne unka shishyatv grahan kiya
 They always address themselves as servants of poor
 bharat ke gaurav ko desh-deshaantaron main ujjwal karne kaa unhone sadaa praytn kiya
 The work that Swami Vivekananda did in the brief lifetime of thirty nine years will continue to guide the generations for many centuries to come
 tees varsh kii aayu main swami vivekananda ne chicago, america ke vishwa dharm sammelan main hindu dharm kaa pratinidhitiv kiya or use saarvbhaumik pahchaan dilvaayi
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur once said- "if you want to know India, read Vivekananda
 unamem aap sab kuch sakaaratmak hi paayenge, nakaaratmak kuch bhi nahin
 " romaa rolland ne unke bare main kaha tha-"unke dwitiya hone kii kalpana karnaa bhi asambhav he, ve jahaan bhi gayi, sarvapratham hi rahe
 Everyone used to show their leader in them
 ve ishwar ke pratinidhi the or sab par prabhutv praapt kar lenaa hi unki vishistataa thi
 Once in the Himalayas, an unknown traveler stopped looking at them and shouted, "shiva!" This happened as if that person's adorable god had written his name on his forehead
 " He was not only a saint, but also a great patriot, speaker, thinker, writer and human lover
 america se lautakar unhone deshavaasiyon kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha tha-"nayaa bharat nikal pade mochi kii dukaan se, bhadbhoonje ke bhaad se, kaarkaane se, haat se, bazaar se; nikal padey jhaadiyon, jangalon, pahaado, parvaton se
 "and the public answered Swamiji's call
 vah garv ke saath nikal padi
 The public support that Gandhiji got in the freedom struggle was the result of Vivekananda's call
 is prakaar ve bhartiya swatantrata sangram ke bhi ek pramukh prerana ke strot bane
 He believed that the holy year of India is the holy land of religion and philosophy
 yaheen bade-bade mahatmaon va rishiyon kaa janm hua, yahi sanyas evam tyaag kii bhoomi he tathaa yaheen-keval yaheen-adikaal se lekar aaj tak manushya ke liye jivan ke sarvocch adarsh evam mukti kaa dwaar khulaa hua he
 His statement - "'get up, wake up, wake yourself up and wake others up
" apane nar-janm ko safal karo or tab tak nahin ruko jab tak lakshya praapt na ho jaye
 " unnisvin sadi ke aakhri varshon main vivekananda lagbhag sashastr yaa hinsak kranti ke jariye bhi desh ko aaazaad karnaa chaahate the
 But he soon became convinced that the circumstances were not yet ripe for those intentions
 iske baad hi vivekananda ne ‘ekala chalo‘ kii niti kaa paalan karte hue ek parivrajak ke rup main bharat or duniya ko khangaal daalaa
 He said that i want many young ascetics who can spread to the villages of India and spend their time in the service of countrymen
 unka yah sapana puraa nahin hua
 Vivekananda was strongly opposed to priesthood, religious fanaticism, dogma and orthodoxy
 unhone dharm ko manushya kii seva ke kendra main rakhkar hi aadhyatmik chintan kiya tha
 Their Hindu religion was not strange, ludicrous and pneumatic
 unhone yah vidrohi bayaan diya tha ki is desh ke taintis karod bhukhe, daridr or kuposhan ke shikaar logon ko devi devataaon kii tarah mandiron main sthapit kar diya jaye or mandiron se devi devataaon kii murtiyon ko hataa diya jaye
 This classic call of theirs raises a big question mark at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century
 unke is aahvaan ko sunakar puure purohit varg kii ghigghi bandh gai thi
 Today, if any other sage, can the government machinery also not afford to remove the idol of any illegal temple
 vivekananda ke jivan kii antarlay yahi thi ki ve is baat se aashwast the ki dharti kii god main yadi aisa koi desh he jisane manushya kii har tarah kii behatari ke liye eemaandaar koshishen kii hai, to vah bharat hi he
 He also ridiculed priesthood, Brahminism, religious rituals and stereotypes and waged a war against such inconsistencies in almost invasive language
 unki drushti main hindu dharm ke sarvshereshth chintakon ke vichaaron kaa nichod puri duniya ke liye ab bhi irshyaa kaa vishay he
 Swamiji had indicated that there is material prosperity abroad and that India needs it too, but we should not be a petitioner
 hamaare paas usase zyada bahut kuch he jo ham pashchim ko de sakate hai or pashchim ko uski besakhta jarurat he
 This was not a boast or boast of Swami Vivekananda for the heritage of his country
 yah ek vedanti sadhu kii bhartiya sabhyataa or samskruti kii tatasth, vastuparak or moolyagat aalochana thi
 The history of the twentieth century later stamped the same
 vivekanand ojasvi or sargarbhit vyakhyanon kii prasiddhi vishwa bhar main he
 On the last day of life, he explained Shukla Yajurveda and said- "want one more Vivekananda, to understand what this Vivekananda has done till now
 " unke shishyon ke anusaar jivan ke antim din 4 july 1902 ko bhi unhone apni dhyaan karne kii dincharya ko nahin badla or praat: do teen ghante dhyaan kiya or dhyanavastha main hi apane brahmarandhra ko bhedakar mahasamadhi le lee
 He was cremated on the pyre of Chandan on the banks of the Ganges in Belur
 isi ganga tat ke duusari ore unke guru ramakrishna paramhans kaa solah varsh purv antim sanskaar hua tha
 His disciples and followers built a temple there in his memory and established more than 130 centers for propagating the messages of Vivekananda and his Guru Ramakrishna all over the world
 swami vivekananda maikale dwaara pratipaadit or us samay prachlit agreji shiksha vyavastha ke virdohi the, kyonki is shiksha kaa uddeshy sirf baabuon kii sankhya badhanaa tha
 He wanted an education that could lead to all-round development of the child
 balak kii shiksha kaa uddeshy usko aatmanirbhar banaakar apane pairon par khadaa karnaa he
 Swami Vivekananda has termed the prevailing education as 'prohibitive education' and said that you consider a person who has passed some examinations and who can give good speeches, but the reality is that education is a struggle for the masses
 For those who do not build character, who do not develop the spirit of social service and who cannot cultivate courage like a lion, such a shi What are the benefits of Rsha? atah swamiji saiddhanthik shiksha ke paksh main nahin the, ve vyaavhaarik shiksha ko vyakti ke liye upyogi maanate the
 The education of a person prepares him for the future, so it is necessary to have those elements in education, which are important for his future
 swami vivekananda ke shabdon main, Swami Ji wants to prepare for both secular and otherworldly life through education
 loukik drushti se shiksha ke sambandh main unhone kaha he ki 'hamen aisi shiksha chahie, jisase charitra kaa gathan ho, man kaa bal bade, buddhi kaa vikaas ho or vyakti swazlambi bane
 He has said 'from a worldly point of view that' education is an expression of the inherent perfection of man
 ' Following are the basic principles of Swami Vivekananda's education philosophy - 1
 shiksha aisi ho jisase balak kaa shaareerik, maansik evam atmik vikaas ho sake
 2
 Education should be in such a way that the child's character is built, the mind is developed, the intellect is developed and the child becomes self-reliant
 3
 balak evam balikaon donon ko samaan shiksha deni chahie
 4
 Religious education should be imparted through conduct and rituals rather than books
 5
 paathyakram main loukik evam parloukik donon prakaar ke vishyon ko sthaan dena chahie
 6
 Education can be obtained in Guru Griha
 7
 shikshak evam chaatr kaa sambandh adhik se adhik nikat kaa hona chahie
 8
 Publicity and propagation of education should be known to the general public
 9
 desh kii aarthik pragati ke liye takneekee shiksha kii vyavastha kii jaay
 10
 Human and national education should start from the family

 His poetry written in Persian is very famous in Iran and Afghanistan, where he is called iqbal-e-lahore
 inhone islam ke dharmik or rajnatik darshan par kaafii likhaa he
 Iqbal became the father of Pakistan because he was "the first person to appeal for the creation of a state consisting of Punjab, North West Frontier Province, Sindh and Balochistan", in his presidential address to the 21st session of the Indian Muslim League
 Which was held on 29 December 1930 in Allahabad
 bharat ke vibhaajan or pakistan kii sthapana kaa vichaar sabase pehle iqbaal ne hi uthaaya tha
 In 1930, under his leadership, the Muslim League first demanded the partition of India
 iske baad inhone jinna ko bhi muslim lig main shaamil hone ke liye prerit kiya or unke saath pakistan kii sthapana ke liye kaam kiya
 He is considered as the national minister in Pakistan
 inhen allamaa iqbaal, muffakir-e-pakistan, shaayar-e-mashriq or hakim-ul-ummat bhi kaha jaataa he
 Excerpt from a speech about Jinnah in 1938 pakistan banane main agrani hone ke sambandh main jinna par ikbaal kaa prabhaav behad "mahatvapurn", "shaktishaalee" or yahaan tak ki "nirvivaad" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he

 Madhvacharya is considered the third incarnation of Vayu
 madhwacharya kai arthon main apane samay ke agradoot the, ve kai baar prachlit ritiyon ke viruddh chale gayi hai
 He presented the dvaita philosophy
 inhone dwait darshan ke brahmasutra par bhashya likhaa or apane vedant ke vyaakhyaan kii taarkik pushti ke liye ek swatantra granth 'anuvyaakhyaan' bhi likhaa
 Commentaries on the Srimad Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads, the treatise on the Mahabharathataparyanryanay and the Shrimad Bhagwatpuran are his other treatises, explaining the meaning of the Mahabharata

 Traditional descriptions of Madhvacharya's biography and works are found in the texts Narayan Panditacharya, Sumadhvavijaya and Manimanjari
 parantu ye granth acharya ke prati lekhak ke shraddhalu hone ke kaaran atiranjana, chamatkaar or avishwasaneey ghatnaon se purna hai
 Therefore, on the basis of these, no precise details can be presented regarding Madhavacharya's life
 shri madhwacharya ne prasthaantrayee granthon se apane dwaitvaad siddhant kaa vikaas kiya
 It is also called 'sadvaishnav', because it is different from Sri Ramanujacharya's Sri Vaishnavism
 shri madhwacharya ne `'panch bhed' kaa adhyayan kiya jo `atyant bhed darshanam ́ bhi kaha jaataa he
 He has five characteristics: `atyant bhed darshanam ́ kaa vargeekaran padaarth rup main is prakaar bhi kiya gaya he : An independent is one who is completely independent
 jo bhagwaan yaa sanathan satya he
 But Jeevatma and Jagat are dependent on God
 isaliye bhagwaan unka niyantran karte hai
 God is independent
 isliye unka vargeekaran asambhav he
 Dependent elements are divided into positive and negative forms
 sakaaratmak ko bhi chetan or achetan main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Before defining the unconscious element, Madhvacharya talks about the independent and dependent who are eternally free from the world
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar `vishnu` swatantra hai jo viveki or sansar ke niyanta hai
 Her Shakti is Lakshmi who is eternally free
 kai vyuhon evam avtaron ke roopon main ham vishnu ko paa sakate hai 
 Similarly, the very dependent Lakshmi is also the power of Vishnu and can take many forms only for the physical body
 vah dukh-dard se pare hai
 His sons are Brahma and Vayu
 `prakruti ́ shabd pra = pare + kriti = sristi kaa sangam he
 Madhvacharya considered creation and Brahma separate

 Human use resources have been classified into four main categories; Archaeological significance or cultural resource sites, high-use recreational areas or shoreline access points, important protected management areas or resource sources
 Some examples include airports, diving sites, popular beach sites, ports, natural protected areas, or marine sanctuaries

 Exploring the scope of an oil leak also involves confirming that the hydrocarbon collected during the ongoing oil leak is derived from an active leak or from another source
 Sophisticated analytical chemistry focused on the characteristics of the oil source can be obtained based on the complex mixture of substances present
 mote taur par, ye anek hydrocarbon honge jinamein se sarvaadhik upyogi poliaromatic hydrocarbon hai
 In addition, both hydrocyclic hydrocarbons of oxygen and nitrogen, such as the parent of carboxyl and alkyl homologs, quinoline and pyridine, are available in many crude oils

 Fundamentally, the Chancellor was a Roman judge who had a system of sitting behind a curtain in the courts

 The post of Chancellor in England was established during the time of Edward the Confessor
 edward pehla angrej raja tha jisane rajpatron par hastakshar karne ke bajaay unpar rajmudra ankit karne kii narman pratha apanaai
 Initially in England, the Chancellor was a religious official who on the one hand performed religious work as a Rajpurohit, on the other hand was the king's secretary and patron of the Rajmudra in the state territory
 raajpurohit ke rup main vah raja ke 'nyaayachaar kaa sangrakshak' tha, sachiv ke rup main use rajkeey kaaryon main raja kaa vishwaas praapt tha tathaa rajmudra ke sangrakshak ke rup main vah rajagna kii abhivyakti ke liye aavashyak tha
 But primarily he was the chairman of Chancery, a department of the secretariat
 henry dwitiya ke rajya kaal main chancelar nyaayik kaary bhi karne laga
 The main reason for the increase of his judicial work was that all the requests addressed to the king reached the king through him
 in nivedanpatron kii sankhya itani badhane lagi ki edward pratham ne ek ajyapti dwaara chancelar ko un par nirnay dene kaa adhikaar saunpa
 During the reign of Edward III, the Chancellor acquired considerable rights for these judicial functions
 san 1474 i
 main uske ye adhikaar yahan tak bad gaye ki apane nirnay vah privi council ko na bhej kar, swayan nyaayik ajyaptiyaan jari karne laga
 In the first half of the 19th century, the Chancellor, respectively, entrusted the task of passing judgment on fundamental lawsuits to the Chancery judges under him, and when the Court of Appeal was established in Chancery in 1851, he himself heard the appeal against the decision of the Primary Courts
 There was a difference of opinion between the judges of the Court of Appeal in Chancery
 aadhunik kaal main chancelar ucch nyaayalay ke chanceri vibhaag kaa ek sadsy he tathaa apane nyaayik adhikaar privi kauncil kii nyaayik samiti tathaa house of lards main prayukt karata he

 He is also a visitor to some universities as a representative of the king

 Thus Lord Chancellor is a vivid example against the principle of division of power with his legislative, judicial and administrative rights
 pad kii ucchata main cantarbari ke arqbishap ke baad hi uskaa sthaan he

 dunedin international airport momona main taieri plance par shahar se dakshin pashchim disha main 30 kimi kii duuri par sthit he
 The airport operates only one terminal and 1,900-meter-long runway and is the third busiest airport on the South Island after Christchurch and Queenstown
 iskaa istemaal praathmik rup se gharelu udaanon ke liye kiya jaataa he or iske saath hi saath oakland, christchurch, wellington, rotorua or palmerston north se or tak niyamit udaanen bhari jaati hai or queenstown, vanaka or fiordland se or tak mausami udaanen bhari jaati hai lekin yahaan saal bhar brisben se aane or vahaan jane ke liye antarrashtriya udaanen or sidney or melborn se aane or vahaan jane ke liye mausami antarrashtriya udaanen bhi bhari jaati hai
 In recent years, fewer international flights operating directly to the airport can be attributed to the impending decline in international passengers
 unnisvin sadi ke antim daur main or beesvin sadi ke aarambhik daur main port chalgers or portobelo ke bich ghat seva kaa sanchaalan kiya jaataa tha
 Occasional ships and boats are ferried there to revive them, and to investigate the operating system to restore one of its original ghats and re-use it for this route

 According to modern scholars, the unbroken flow of Sanskrit language has been flowing for five thousand years
 bharat main yah aryabhasha kaa sarvaadhik mahatvashaalee, vyapak or sampann swaroop he
 Through this, India's finest manisha, talent, invaluable contemplation, contemplation, prudence, creative, creative and ideological wisdom have been expressed
 aaj bhi sabhi kshetron main is bhashaa ke dwaara granthanirmaan kii ksheen dhara avichhinn rup se vah rahi he
 Even today, this language is spoken only in a very limited area
 isamen vyaakhyaan hote hai or bharat ke vibhinn pradeshik bhashabhashi panditjan iskaa paraspar vaartalap main prayog karte hai
 It is still used in the ceremonial works of Hindus
 isi kaaran greek or latin aadi pracheen mrit bhashaaon se sanskrit kii sthiti bhinn he
 It is immortal, not dead
 bharat main sanskrit bhashaa kaa prayog band hona ek achambhe kii baat he, kuch log kehete hai ki sanskrit ke kathin hone ke kaaran ise hataa diya gaya
 But the world's most difficult language is Chinese, then why did they not stop using Chinese
 sanskrit kaa hamaare samaaj se lupt ho kar hindi evam anya bhashaaon main badalanaa bada hi azeeb he
 It seems that Hindi and other languages have been created by distorting Sanskrit, when someone tried to finish Sanskrit language, different languages were created from it in different places
 or esa karne kii ek hi vajah ho sakati he, kyonki hamaare saare veda evam pracheen granth jo ki gyaan evam rahasy sa bharpoorn hai wo sab sanskrit main hai
 Those who tried to destroy the Sanskrit language did not want that everyone could acquire the knowledge of Vedas and Puranas written in Sanskrit and reveal the secrets
 riksanhita kii bhashaa ko sanskrit kaa aadyatam uplabdh rup kaha ja saktaa he
 It is also believed that the language of the first and tenth divisions of Rakshanita is ancient
 kuch vidvan pracheen vaidic bhashaa ko parvarti panineey sanskrit se bhinn maanate hai
 But this aspect is confusing
 vaidic bhashaa abhraant rup se sanskrit bhashaa kaa aadya uplabdh rup he
 The Sanskrit language of which Panini has written grammar has two parts - acharya patanjali ke "vyakaran mahabhashya" naamak prasiddh shabdanushasan ke aarambh main bhi vaidic bhashaa or loukik bhashaa ke shabdon kaa ullekh hua he
 "sanskrit name Dainvi Vaganvakhyata Maharsibhi:" The sentence which has been called Devbhasha or 'sanskrit' was probably expressed in two names, levels and forms of "chhandobhasha" and "lokbhasha" by the time of Yask, Panini, Katyayana and Patanjali
 bahut se vidwaanon kaa mat he ki bhashaa ke liye "sanskrit" shabd kaa prayog sarvaprath valmiki ramayana ke sundarkand main hanuman dwaara visheshanroop main kiya gaya he
 According to the legend of the Indian tradition, the Sanskrit language was previously inalienable, that is, its nature and response was not analyzed properly
 devon dwaara prarthana karne par devraj indra ne prakruti, pratyay aadi ke vishleshan vivechan kaa upayatmak vidhaan prastut kiya
 Due to this "sanskar" legislation, India's oldest Aryabhasa was named "sanskrit"
 riksanhitakalin "sadhubhasha" tathaa 'brahman', 'aaranyak' or 'dashopanishad' naamak granthon kii saahitiyik "vaidic bhashaa" kaa ananthar viksit swaroop hi "loukik sanskrit" yaa "panineey sanskrit" kahalaaya
 The same language is known by the names "sanskrit", "sanskrit language" or "literary Sanskrit"
 vikaas kii drushti se "sanskrit" kaa arth he - sans se bani 
 From the point of view of spirituality and communal development, "sanskrit" means - Krit or self which came from the early people to meditate on themselves and communally
 kuch log sanskrit ko ek sanskaar bhi maanate hai
 From the point of view of the country, all the forms of Sanskrit are based on the original, medieval and Aryavartiya divisions in the earlier period
 paninisutron main "vibhaasha" yaa "udicham" shabdon se in vibhaashaon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Apart from these, "oriental" etc
 dialects were also spoken in some areas
 kintu panini ne niyamit vyakaran ke dwaara bhashaa ko ek parishkrut evam sarvagy prayog main aane yogya rup pradan kiya
 Gradually, the usage and development of the Pannisamnt language became almost permanent
 patanjali ke samay tak aryaavart ke shisht janon main sanskrit praaia: bolchaal kii bhashaa ban gai
 "gadarshatpratyakkalakavanaddakshinen Himwantamuttareen wariyatramtasminnaryavarte aryanivase xxrep 5 
 " As mentioned, Sanskrit soon became the cultural, ideological and scholastic language of the biotic and scholarly class of the whole of India
 sanskrit bhashaa ke vikasstaron kii drushti se anek vidwaanon ne anek rup se iskaa aitihaasi kalvibhaajan kiya he
 For general convenience, the following valid division is being given - adikaal Medieval period parvartikal In this era, the creation of texts of poetry, drama, literature, tantra, craftsmanship, etc
, as well as explanatory works of original texts, were important creations
 bhashya, tikaa, vivaran, vyaakhyaan aadi ke rup main jin sahasron granthon kaa nirmaan hua unamem anek bhashya or tikaaon kii pratishtha, manyata or prasiddhi mulgranthon se bhi kahin-kahin adhik hui
 The earliest available grammar of this language is Ashtadhyayi of Panini in view of authenticity
 kam se kam 600 i
 pus
 kaa yah granth aaj bhi samast vishwa main athulaneey vyakaran he
 The philosophers of the world and mainly the United States consider Ashtadhyayi to be the best book in the world even today in terms of organizational linguistics
 "broomfield" ne apane "language" tathaa anya kritiyon main is tathy kii pusht sthapana kii he
 Before Panini, the Sanskrit language was certainly the behavior language of well-meaning and Vedic people
 asanskrit janon main bhi bahut si boliyaan us samay prachlit rahi hongi
 But this opinion is not accepted by modern linguists
 ve kehete hai ki sanskrit kabhi bhi vyavahaarabhasha nahin thi
 The languages of the people can be called the then Prakrit
 devbhasha tatvat: kritrim yaa sanskaar dwaara nirmit brahmanpanditon kii bhashaa thi, lokbhasha nahin
 But this opinion is not acceptable
 panini se lekar patanjali tak sabhi ne sanskrit kaa lok kii bhashaa kaha he, loukik bhashaa bataaya he
 Hundreds of other evidences prove that "sanskrit" was the lingua franca and practice language in Vedic and post-vedic pre-colonial times
 yah avashya rahaa hoga ki desh, kaal or samaaj ke sandarbh main uski apni seemaa rahi hogi
 Later it became the literary and cultural language of the read society
 tadnantar yah samast bharat main sabhi panditon kii, chaahe ve arya rahen hon yaa aryetar jati ke - sabhi kii, sarvamaanya saanskrithik bhashaa ho gai or asethuhimachal iskaa prasar, samaadar or prachaar rahaa evam aaj bhi bana hua he
 Sanskrit was introduced to missionaries and other students from Europe and Western countries from the first half of the seventeenth century
 dhire-dhire pashchim main hi nahin, samast vishwa main sanskrit kaa prachaar hua
 Many scholars of German, English, French, American and European countries have made the study of Sanskrit especially in modern scholars
 aadhunik vidwaanon or anushilkon ke mat se vishwa kii purabhaashaon main sanskrit sarvaadhik vyavasthit, vaigyanik or sampann bhashaa he
 Today, it is not only an Indian language, but also a world language
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki bhumandal ke praytn-bhashaa-saahitiyon main kadachit sanskrit kaa vaanmay sarvaadhik vishaal, vyapak, chaturmukhi or sampann he
 Sanskrit language and literature are being studied today in almost all developed and almost all developing countries of the world
 bataaya ja chukaa he ki is bhashaa kaa parichay hone se hi arya jati, uski samskruti, jivan or tathakthith mul aadya aryabhasha se sambhddha vishyon ke adhyayan kaa pashchimi vidwaanon ko thos aadhaar praapt hua
 On the basis of ancient Greek, Latin, Avasta and Rixanskrit etc
, the sound, grammar and form of the original Arya language could be envisaged, in which the contribution of Rixanskrit is of the highest importance
 greek, latin pratnagathic aadi bhashaaon ke saath sanskrit kaa paariwarik or nikat sambandh he
 But Sanskrit is most closely associated with indo-iranian-language languages
 bharat kii sabhi aadya, madhyakaalin evam aadhunik aryabhashaon ke vikaas main mulat: rugveda-evam taduttarkalin sanskrit kaa aadhaarik evam aupaadanik yogadan rahaa he
 Modern linguists believe that since the Rig Veda period, spoken and natural Prakrit languages must have been prevalent in the masses
 unheen se pali, praakrit, apbhransh tathaa taduttarkalin aryabhashaon kaa vikaas hua
 But Sanskrit language has contributed most and universally in this development
 yaheen par yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki sanskrit bhashaa ne bharat ke vibhinn pradeshon or anchalon kii aryetar bhashaaon ko bhi kaaphi prabhavit kiya tathaa swayan unase prabhavit hui; un bhashaaon or unke bhaashankartaaon kii samskruti or sahitya ko to prabhavit kiya hi, unki bhashaaon shabdkosh unak dhvanimala or lipikla ko bhi apane yogadan se labhanvit kiya
 There were two ancient scripts of India - Brahmi and Kharoshthi
 inamen brahmi ko sanskrit ne mukhyat: apanaaya
 From the point of view of language, the sound of Sanskrit is sufficiently rich
 swaron kii drushti se yadhyapi greek, latin aadi kaa vishisht sthaan he, tathaapi apane kshetra ke vichaar se sanskrit kii swarmala paryaapt or bhashanuroop he
 The cuisine is very rich
 sahasron varshon tak bhartiya aaryon ke aadyashutisahitya kaa adhyanadhyaapan guru shishyon dwaara maukhik parampara ke rup main pravartmaan rahaa kyonki kadachit us yug main, lipikla kaa udbhav or vikaas nahin ho paaya tha
 Probably some time before or after Panini, the script was used in India and mainly "brahmi" was made the vehicle of Sanskrit
 isi brahmi ne arya or aryatar adhikansh lipiyon kii varnmala or varnakram ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 If the Sanskrit language and Brahmi script have sufficient influence on the medieval maternal Indian Dravidian languages and also the alphabet of Tamil, Telugu etc
 dhvanimala or dhwanikram kii drushti se paninikaal se prachlit sanskrit varnmaala aaj bhi kadachit vishwa kii sarvaadhik vaigyanik evam shastreey varnmaala he
 Along with the Sanskrit language, it has been propagated all over the world today as a direct or Roman nonchalant in the whole world
 aitihaasik bhashavigyaan kii drushti se sanskrit bhashaa aryabhasha parivaar ke antargat rakhi gai he
 Aryajati came from outside India or had its residence here - due to unnecessary consideration, it is not being done here
 par aadhunik bhashavigyaan ke panditon kii manyata ke anusaar bharat europea bhashabhashiyon kii jo naanaa pracheen bhashaayen, thi, ve vastut: ek mulbhasha kii deshkalanusaari vibhinn shakhaayen thi
 All of them are called the primary language of origin or native language
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat main-veeraa-mulnivasasthaan ke vaasi susangathit aaryon ko hi "viros" yaa viras kehete the
 The various ancient linguists who referred to the aforementioned ancient Aryabhasa group of languages by the word Viros have been called Viras
 arthath samast bhashaayen paariwarik drushti se aryapariwaar kii bhashaayen hai
 Sanskrit is the second highest among them
 ukt parivaar kii "kentum" or "shatam" do pramukh shakhaayen hai
 The first includes Greek, Latin etc
 sanskrit kaa sthaan "shatam" ke antargat bharat-irani shakha main mana gaya he
 Who is ancient, oldest and oldest in the Aryan family, it is not completely certain
 phir bhi aadhunik adhikansh bhashavid greek, latin aadi ko aadya aryabhasha kii jyeshtha santati or sanskrit ko unki choti bahin maanate hai
 Not only this, the oldest avasta of indo-iranian branch is also considered ancient from Sanskrit
 parantu anek bhartiya vidvan samajhate hai ki "jind-avastaa" kii avastaa kaa swaroop rikbhasha kii apeksha navy he
 Whatever it is, it is so certain that Rakshamita is the oldest in memory from residual memory in the text and hence that language is also the oldest in its achievement
 uski vaidic samhitaon kii badi visheshta yah he ki hajaaron varshon tak jab lipi kala kaa bhi pradurbhaav nahin tha, vaidic samhitaayein maukhik or shrutiparampara dwaara gurushishyon ke samaaj main akhand rup se pravahamaan thim
 The accuracy of pronunciation was preserved so much that the sound and volume, not only, there was no recitation in Vedic mantras from thousands of years ago
 udaatt anudattadi swaron kaa uccharan shuddh rup main purnat: avikrut rahaa
 Modern linguists believe that in terms of vowels, the languages of the "kentum" class of Greek, Latin etc
 are also much richer and closer to the original or primitive Aryan language
 unamem ukt bhashaa kii swarasampatti adhik surakshit hai
 In Sanskrit, consonants are more secure
 bhashaa ke sanghatnatmak athwa roopaatmak vichaar kii drushti se sanskrit bhashaa ko vibhaktipradhan athwa "shlishtbhaasha" kaha jaataa he
 Tattvachintamani is a famous book of Navyanya composed by Gangesh Upadhyay
 tatvachintamani ke pashchaat jitne nyayagranth likhe gaye ve sab navyanyay ke naam se prakhyat hai
 He has composed this book in the interpretation of only one sutra of Gautama 'prakritikopaman Shabdha: Certification'
 yah nyaay granth chaar khandon main vibhajit he - pratyakshkhand, anumaankhand, upmankhand or shabdakhand
 It does not contain 16 elements as in the preceding Nyayikayas
 isamen unhone avachhedya-avachchhedak, nirupya-nirupak, anuyogi-pratiyogi aadi paribhaashik shabdon kaa prayog kar ek nai swatantra lekhan style ko janm diya jiskaa anusaran parvarti anek darshanikon ne kiya he
 The number of commentaries written on Tattvakintamani, with as much detail, has not been written on any other book
 pehle isaki tikaa pakshdhar mishra ne kii; tadnantar unke shishy rudradutt ne ek apni tikaa taiyaar kii
