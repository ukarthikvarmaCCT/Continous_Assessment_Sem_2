 In 1961, Broccoli again partnered with Harry Saltzman and bought the film rights to all Bond novels from Fleming
 However, many Hollywood film studios did not want to invest in the film, as they found it "too British" or "overly erotic"
 The producers needed US $ 1 million for the conversion of Thunderball or Dr
 No, and in July 1961 the deal was signed with United Artists

 The producers turned to Sean Connery, who eventually played Bond in five consecutive films
 According to one story, Connery was suggested by Polish director Ben Fyz, a friend of Saltzmann's

 Connery stated that "after all, that character is not really me"
 Ian Fleming told his research assistant after watching a preview screening of the first film Dr
 No, "horrible
 Absolutely terrible
" Dr
 No received mixed reviews, some quite unfavorable, and even faced the Vatican rebuke
 Fleming consequently befriended Connery so much that he could establish a Scottish ancestry for Bond in later novels

 The use of a dangerous laser, invented only a few years ago and not widely known by the public, was a cutting-edge display of real technology and perhaps the most memorable line of Bond films found in this film: bond: kya aap mujhase baat karne kii ummid karte hai?goldfinger: nahin, mistar bond, main aapse marane kii ummid karata hum!

 Connery was eager to start working, but in a pre-production interview he admitted that "my only complaint about the Bond films is that they don't put any emphasis on you as an actor
 What you need is Anatomy like a rugby player so that you can do 18 weeks of training in swimming, punches and lovemaking


 i want to see someone else become a bond
 "template: James Bond Timeline Connery later stated that Thunderball was his personal favorite performance as Bond
 Thunderball was the most successful Bond film to date by gross box office, grossing around $ US1 billion
 It also inspired other detective films of the 1960s, including the "harry Palmer" trilogy starring Michael Caine, the "derek Flint" series with James Cowburn, the Matt Helm series with Dean Martin

 The title was taken from a pseudo-haiku written by Fleming in the book "you Only Live Twice / Once When You're Born / And Once When You Look Death in the Face
" And the martial arts and ninja scene were brand new at the time
 yu onli liv twis aisi pehali james bond film thi jisamen se fleming kii strot saamagree ke kathanak aadhaar ko baahar nikaal diya gaya tha, haalanki film kaa sheershak vahi rakhaa gaya
 Based on the film's screenplay entirely in Japan, the use of Blofeld as the main villain, and a Bond girl named Kisii Suzuki - the page script, screenplay and presentation were entirely the product of the screenwriter, and they took it to pre-marked locations Filmed, such as Ninja Fort and Volcanic Mountain
 This became common during the Roger Moore period, but only in this Connery film, in such a fundamental way, as the series went beyond Fleming, who died about three years before the release of Only Only Live Twice Had finished yu onli liv twis ke baad or postaron par "shaun conary, james bond hai" prachaarit karne ke baavjood, conary ne ghoshnaa kii ki yah unki aakhri bond film he

 In Fleming's novel, Bond attempts to avenge his wife's murder in You Only Live Twice at Her Majesty's Secret Service
 lekin chunki baad vaali film kaa filmakan pehle hua tha, blofeld ko diamonds aar forever kahani main rakhaa gaya taaki bond ko blofeld ko fatkaarane kaa avasar mil sake

 moore ne koshish kii ki ve shaun conary yaa da saint main simon templer kii apni bhoomika kii nakal naa karen or unhone bond ko adhik prasannchit or vinodi rup main abhinit kiya
 In contrast to the manner in which Lezenbai was introduced, Moore's first two films actually take away the common motifs of the Bond films and give him cigars instead of cigarettes and he drinks bourbon instead of martini
 ek sameekshak ne kaha, "roger moore main shaun conary kii zaraa si bhi gambhirtha nahin he

 universal pikchars ke pratidwandvi jesan bourn frenchais kii safalataa se utsahit hokar MGM or EON ne "bond ko apane mul rup main waapas laane" kaa faisla kiya jiske tahat uske un murkhataa purna yantron or apraasangik kaalpanik tatwon ko hataaya janaa tay hua jo shrunkhlaa ko paribhaashit karne lage the or ek adhik sakht, gahare or adhik vaastavik bond ko pesh karne kaa nishchay kiya gaya jo uske kisi purv filmi avatar ke bajaay ian fleming ke mul upanyaas ke bond ke saath mail khaataa ho
 Thus, Casino Royale, Bond's 21st film, was the first film to be a film adaptation of Fleming's novel since 1974's The Man with the Golden Gun
 is frenchise ko ek punarrachana hona tha, jisamen ek nai samay rekha or kathanaatmak dhaanche ko sthapit kiya janaa tha jo kisi pichhali film kaa hissaa nahin hoti

 As was the case with the introduction of new bonds in the past, the film provided an opportunity to remove the construction detail and revert to the original elements
 agast 2005 tak, atakalein puure jor par thi ki 37 varshiya danniel craig par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he, haalanki bhoomika ke liye puure paatr chayan ko vastav main sitambar ke pehle tak nahin kiya gaya tha
 Then, on 14 October 2005, EON Productions and Sony Pictures Entertainment publicly confirmed at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig, one of the stars of Steven Spielberg's Munich, would soon be the sixth actor to play James Bond
 is nirnay ke baad mahatvapurn vivaad uthe, chunki is baat par andeh tha ki nirmaataaon ne sahi chunaav kiya he
 During the entire production period internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond
com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest
 purv ke abhinaytaon ke vipareet craig ko virodhiyon dwaara, bond kii us lambi, khubasurat or karishmai chhavi main feet nahin paaya gaya, jiske darshak aadi ho chuke the
 The Daily Mirror published a front page news critique of Craig titled My Name Is Bland - James Bland
 However, reviews for Casino Royale were favorable and the film became the highest-grossing Bond film after Moon Raycar
 roger abert ne tippanee kii ki, "bond ke rup main danniel craig shandaar rahe: duble, adhik alpbhaashi, kam kamandh, sharir or aatma main chot khaane main sakasham, chede jane par parvaah naa karne vaala
" As Casino Royale reached its final stages of construction, producer Michael G

 Its production will begin in late 2011 with Daniel Craig returning as James Bond
 Bond 23 will be directed by Sam Mendes and the screenplay has been written by Bond veterans, Neil Purvis and Robert Wade as well as John Logan
 sikret sarvice' The late 1980s saw the end of the Dalton era as well as the era of a common creative team that worked on Bond films from the beginning in 1962, including Albert Broccoli as producer, who died in the first Broznan
 The film took place shortly after its release

 All films directed by either Terence Young, Guy Hamilton, Louis Gilbert, or John Glenn, except Lezenbai's On Her Majesty's Secret Service
 After Timothy Dalton's last film, none of them worked on Bond's film

 However, the screenplay of four of the six films from 1995 to 2008 was produced by Neil Purvis, who collaborated with Robert Wade four times, and David Arnold composed the score in five of the six films
 broznan kaal kii shuruyaat se hi aisa hua ki great britain ke baahar ke nirdeshkon kaa istemaal kiya gaya, lekin ve sabhi rashtramandal deshon se the, sirf 2008 main kwantum of soles pehali bond film thi jiskaa nirdesan ek gaiyr united kingdom yaa rashtramandal ke nirdeshak ne kiya, german-swiss mark forster ne

 Early Bond films included Fleming's stories, but later - especially Roger Moore Walli - only used character names or place names
 jabaki da spai hu lavd me ke sheershak ko fleming ke upanyaas ke sheershak se liya gaya he or a vyuu tu a kil or kwantum of soles kaa sheershak unki laghu katha ke naam par rakhaa gaya he, in filmon main lekhak kii kisi bhi mul saamagree kaa upyog nahin kiya gaya 
 The last film before Casino Royale, titled Fleming's novel, was Moonrecker, after which the series used the title of short stories until 1987's The Living Daylights
 haalanki, "risiko" kahani kii saamagree ko for yor aaiz onli main istemaal kiya gaya, "da property of a ladi" ko octopussi main shaamil kiya gaya or "da hildebrands reyrity" ke tatwon ko pehali mul sheershak vaali film license tu kil main prayog kiya gaya
 Although already adapted as a film, the unused plot tips of the novel Live and Let Die have been used in both For Your Eyes Only and License to Kill, and likewise, Die Another Day incorporates the plot elements of the Moonraker novel has been done
 aakhri dalton film or sabhi chaar broznan filmon ke mul sheershak the, jabaki abhi bhi fleming kii chaar sheershak the jinka ioen shrunkhlaa main prayog kiya janaa tha
 However, License to Kill and The World Is Not Enough are phrases from Ian Fleming's novel and goldeneye was also Fleming's property name in Jamaica and the name of a campaign he planned during World War II
 aisi filmein jinke sheershak fleming se nahin liye gaye hai ve hai ioen shrunkhlaa se tumoro nevar dies or daai andar de or gaiyr ioen film nevar se nevar agen 
 As of 2008, the remaining four short story titles still to be used are Risico, The Hilderbrand Rarity, The Property of a Lady, and 007 in New York
 Prior to the announcement of the title of the 22nd Bond film, media reports such as Variety and the entertainment industry's other publications were speculating that Risico and The Property of a Lady were being considered, but that film's name was eventually quantum Off Solace; The title The Property of a Lady was apparently understood to be Timothy Dalton's third Bond film
 ioen kii sabhi bond filmon main anoothaa gan bairal drishy shaamil hota he, jise graphic kalakaar mauris binder dwaara nirmit kiya gaya
 When Bond walks onscreen, he is seen by the audience through a gunshot which is chased by an unknown assailant
 bond ghumta he or sidhe bandook / darshak kii taraf goli martha he, jiske baad hatyare ke rakt ko bairal / parade se neeche choote dikhaaya jaataa he
 Along with this scene plays the opening music of the "james Bond Theme", composed by Monty Norman, accompanied by composers and instrumentalists John Barry and Burt Rhodes
 After the death of Maurice Binder in 1991, Daniel Klineeman was responsible for the gun barrel scene until Casino Royale
 dizin grih MK12 ne kwantum of soles ke graphics kaa dishanirdesan kiya
 There are many different forms of this scene that relate to Bond's costume, posture, gunshot, blood color, the speed with which blood falls, etc
 aarmabhik drishyon main bond ko suut or taai main dikhaaya gaya he, jiske baad roger moore ne 1977 kii film da spai hu lavd me ke liye nae abhimukhataa anupaat ke saath apane drishy ko filmaaya jiske baad se bond ko dinar jacket or bo taai pahane hue darshaya gaya he
 However, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace show Daniel Craig wearing an open-neck shirt and business suit, respectively
 piers broznan filmon ke saath shuruyaat karte hue, gan bairal ko CGI dwaara prastut kiya gaya jisase uske andar ke pratibimb ko hilne kii anumati mili
 The scene was traditionally placed at the beginning of each film until Casino Royale, while in Casino Royale, the scene is presented after the Cold Open and is included in the plot; In Quantum of Solace it occurs at the end of the film and incorporates the title of the film in its design
 royaal is frenchiz kaa navinikaran he, jiske saath ek nai samay rekha or varnan shuru kiya gaya; or is shrunkhlaa kii kai paramparaon ko yaa to chhod diya gaya yaa nae tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 The main title comes after the gun barrel scene in Dr
 No, but all subsequent films feature pre-title scenes or "teasers" before titles that are partially related to the film's screenplay, fully Or is not related at all
 The gun barrel scene since Thunderball follows unhindered in the pre-title scene where the opening scene can be seen through the gun barrel
 purv-sheershak drishy laghu filmein hai jo bhaavnaatmak mood ko tay karti hai or aane vaale ection ke prati jigyaasa ko badhaati hai
 When they are not related to the main story, Bond is usually shown in the order of completion of a mission, or undergoing an extraordinary rescue
 In three teasers, the film's villains are shown committing their crimes in Bond's absence
 With the introduction of The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977, teasers not only emphasized the action sequences but also introduced death-defying stunt scenes, a practice that went as far as Casino Royale
 The sequence of The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: being more than 14 minutes, it is three times as long as the others
 isi tarah, kwantum of soles is frenchiz kii pehali film he jisaki shuruyaat pichhali kist kisino royaal kii samaapti se sidhe shuru hoti he
 The main title scenes include visual elements that reflect each film's theme and often depict nude and erotic women with moving images that usually reflect the film's general theme; For example, Thunderball depicts deep diving in the ocean and is associated with the opening scene; The initial sequence of Casino Royale, appropriately, depicts a casino design
 mauris binder, teraa bond filmon ke sheershak diziner hai
 Typically a contemporary artist sings in this scene and an instrumental version of the main track is included in the film as a melody, which repeats in different moods
 sheershak geet film ke naam se hameshaa mail nahin khaataa he
 The Spy Who Loved Me features Carly Simon singing "nobody Does It Better"; Octopussy's song, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, does not refer to the title at all
 Jack White has been quoted as saying about the film related to him "it's hard to get the title into a song!" Although the word "solace" has been used once in the second line of the song
 jon bairi ne jin gyaarah filmon ke liye sangeet rachana kii thi unamem se das filmon ke sheershak geet ke liye sangeet bhi diya
 The core of the Bond films is the agent's personality, interest, and skill that has been developed and interpreted by the various actors who played Fleming's James Bond character
 dow no ke nirdeshak, terrence yang ne pehali film ke nirmaan ke dauraan conary ko poshaak pahanane or chalane kaa prashikshan dekar bond kii chhavi ko nirdhaarit kiya
 Much of the charm of this film is Bond's charming character
 vyaktitv main, bond kathor, krur, alag or ghamandi he - jo bolta kam or kaam karne main zyada vishwaas rakhata he
 This is similar to the earlier Fleming novels, while later novels have a more evocative amount of insight into Bond which is rarely seen in films
 shaareerik rup se, bond pusht, sundar or twarit kriya karne vaala he
 On aesthetic grounds, he enjoys delicious cuisine, good wine and plenty of beautiful women
 swaroop main, vah stylish or achche kapade pahanane vaala he
 There is a simple variation in themes between the actors, attributed to the scriptwriters for how they write for the actors
 moore kaa bond thodaa namr he or apane purvavartiyon yaa uttaradhikariyon kii tulana main thodaa adhik romantic he
 Craig's Bond is slightly more melancholy and introverted, while Dalton's Bond is particularly devious and grumpy, while also possessing Moore's romantic qualities
 haalanki, sabhi bond aamtaur par vishesh paristhitiyon main chaturaai purna ek pankti vaale samvaad bolte hai
 Bond's skill as a lover is well established in the films
 is shrunkhlaa main kai jagahon par dwiarthi samvaad hai jo bond ke ling kii kshamta or lambaai ko sanderbhit karte hai or kamottejak baaten, khaskar jab vah bond kanya kii bahon main hota he
 He often "took the opportunity"
 Her sexual prowess often made her enemies her ally, as in the case of Pucci Gaylor
 kuch mahilaayein khud ko bond ke aakarshan se bachane main safal raheen lekin kul milakar pachaas se adhik mahilaon ne ab tak bond ke saath yon sambandh sthapit kiya, jo ek mahila se lekar chaar mahila prati film tak rahaa
 With the exception of Daniel Craig's first two films, each Bond film had a sequence in which Bond makes contact with Miss Moneypenny, a personal assistant to M, Bond's senior
 louis maxwell ne conary, moore or lezenbai ke saath miss manipeni kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa
 He was followed by Caroline Bliss and Samantha Bond, with Dalton and Broznan respectively
 teenon ne yakeenan manipeni ke vyaktitv ko vibhinn aayam die, jaisaa un chah abhinaytaon ne kiya jinhone bond kii bhoomika nibhaai
 is puri film shrunkhlaa main chalane vaala ek satat majaak bond ke liye manipeni kaa ekatarfa prem or bond kii uske saath upree ishkabaaji he
 She also flirts with him and sometimes gets angry with him in hopes of a marriage proposal and a wedding ring
 daai andar de main ek fantasy drishy hi ioen shrunkhlaa kaa ekmaatr avasar tha jisamen manipeni ko bond ke saath vastav main ek premamay aalingan main dikhaaya gaya he
 The character is removed in the reboot film Casino Royale, the first Bond film in which Moneypenny does not appear nor does the character appear in Quantum of Solace
 haalanki, kisino royaal main manipeni ke bare main apratyaksh sandarbh istemaal kiya jaataa he, us drishy ke dauraan jab bond kii mulaaqaat wesper lind ke saath hoti he 
 Setting in Dr
 No, hoisting Bond's cap on the coat rack in M's office in many films signaled the start of a new exciting case
 is theme ke vibhinn rup hai
 At Goldfinger, when Bond leaves the office, Moneypenny takes the hat from him and bounces it himself, hoping to stop Bond
 thanderbal main uskaa dhyaan toss karne ke bich main bhang ho jaataa he jab manipeni bolti he ki vah vilamb se pahunch rahaa he
 When Bond gets married at On Her Majesty's Secret Service, he throws his hat, which Monepeni catches up with
 a vyuu tu kil main bond ke paas manipeni kii ekadam nayi topi he or vah use bas phenkane hi jaataa he ki ruk jaataa he
 And in Moonraker when Bond is in Venice, he hoists his gondolier cap into an empty gondola
 is paramparaagat kram ko yu onli liv twis main yahaan tak ki neeche baithi pandubbi main ek wardroom hatterac par le jaaya jaataa he, jahaan em, manipeni or bond sabhi nau sena kii uniform main hai
 Bond was initially called to meet M, who is the head of the uk's secret intelligence service, who comes to take over his office
 kai filmon main, bond ek gupt mukhyalay yaa karyaalay ke baahar par apane kaarybhaar grahan karata he
 Bond enters and finds m disturbed by the new threat to global peace
 aamtaur par em apane sabase achche agent par vishwaas jataate hai lekin bond ke jokhim bhare tareekon ko badalane kii zarurat ko mahasoos karte hai or unke avivekpurna kathan ke liye aksar upadesh dete hai
 In the film, Universal Exports is used as a cover name for the British Secret Service
 ise filmon main kai tareekon se kai baar chitrit kiya gaya he jaise dow no main ek diarection sin, from rashia wyeth lav main sankshipt rup "univeex", on har majesties sicret sarvice main ek brass nem plate, for yor ij onli main bond ke helicopter, da living dellites main sanket ke saath ek imaarat, da world iz note inf main ek pahchaan patr, casino royaal main ek foulder or kwantum of soles main ek bijness card
 bond ne bhi yu onli liv twis, octopusi, license tu kil, da world iz note inf or daay ender de main apana parichay ek universal export karmchaaree ke rup main pesh kiya he
 The character of m does not appear in For Your Eyes Only, as Bernard Lee, who recently played m for a long time, died
 is film main bond, em ke chif of staff, bill tannar or raksha mantri fredrick grey se jaankaree paata he
 With the introduction of the Broznan series, m is a woman portrayed by Judy Dench, a Shakespearian actress known for her authority roles

 After receiving his assignment, Bond was often sent to the q branch for technical information in which he was assigned special equipment to use in his mission
 multah, upanyaason main, upkaran apekshaakrit mahatvaheen the
 Bond's first film, Dr
 No
 However, the film version of From Russia with Love adopted a higher profile and was always used, except for On Her Majesty's Secret Service and For Your Eyes Only, in which Bond is given some gadgets
 
 dow no
 main kyuu shakha kaa pramukh armorer he, major boothroid, jo bond ko nai bandook walther pipike par nirdesh detaa he
 Beginning in From Russia with Love, the information included various gadgets and technology and Bootheroid became known as Q, beginning with Goldfinger

 At times on the battlefield, q is shown with Bond in the background, with him carrying a portable workshop and his staff
 ye kaaryshaalaayein ek asaamaanya sthanon main sthapit hai jaise da spi hu lavd me main misr kii ek kabr main or munarekar main dakshin america ke math main
 octopussi or license tu kil main, do avasaron par bond ke mishan main kyuu ek sakriy bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Q's role in the 2006 reboot with Casino Royal and later in Quantum of Solace is removed like Moneypenny, and although Bond was acquiring equipment for the mission, no technical details were shown on screen 
 prayogshaala main kai satat majaak darshaae jate hai
 Goldfinger depicts Q's woes as equipment is frequently lost or destroyed by Bond
 Another was also how Bond deviates so easily into experimentation when q tries to forget the details about the use of the devices through quick-talk that needed to come to Bond's memory
 ek or majaak yah he ki bond naveenatam upkarnon ke pratikriya se khush hai or quartermaschar kii krodhit pratikriya he

 Where Bond was most sent to carry out his fascinating works are foreign destinations
 kabhi-kabhi unhen yudhgrast yaa udhaas sthanon main bheja gaya, lekin kuch bindu par unke khalanaayak nasao, jamaica, yaa greece, yaa videshaj sthanon main beja jaataa tha jaise istambul, thailand, bharat, yaa japan
 kuch sthaan jaike san monic or isthamas kaalpanik hai
 On average, one of his films features three foreign countries
 samgr rup se, bond ke romaanch ke liye kareeb 60 desh saath hi bahya sthanon kaa bhraman hua he
 Once in the area, Bond often meets with a local associate upon arrival

 aise charitra mahilaayein bhi ho sakati hai, usamen se kuch mahila bond se aakarshith hai
 There is some repetition of allies through an era, such as the GB chief of the Friends of the West , General Gogol, and Sir Frederick Gray, the Minister of Defense
 kam se kam aadhe filmon ke purv main piars broznan ne felics litre ko james bond ke team main pravesh karavaaya
 litre in filmon main bhi ek choti bhoomika nibhaataa he jaise ki vah fleming upanyaas main nibhaataa he
 Notably, he appears in four of Connery's six EON films, Roger's Moore's only seven of the films, Timothy Dolton's films in both, and Pierce Broznan's four films
 But his return to the films of Daniel Craig
 saath hi lezenbai ke ekmaatr bond kii film main bhi unki upasthiti nahin he
 He appears in both Connery's non-eon films Never Say Never Again and Clarence Leiter in the initial non-eon television Casino Royal
 ioen shrunkhlaa main, 1973 or 1987 ke bich or 1989 or 2006 ke bich litre kaa filmon main koi bhoomika nahin he
 In the novel, Leiter is bitten by a shark and he loses his right hand and left half leg early in the series
 anya upanyaason main jahaan bhi vah prakat hota he usamen vah ek lakdi kaa pair or ek lohe ke hook lagaaya hota he
 After the shark incident, he is taken out of the CIA by a pensioner and works at the Pincherton Detective Agency as reserved in the ninth book Thunderball until being called back to the CIA
 license tu kil tak is ghatana ko film main sthagit kiya gaya he, uske baad litre ko casino royal ke saath matadhikaar ke riboot tak kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 Jack Lord played the role of Leiter in Bond's first film, but was absent in Goldfinger, in which Leiter was played by Ses Leander, an actor who looked much older than Lord
 Since then, Leiter has been cast by various actors, with only David Hudison playing the role more than once before Quentum of Solace
 hadison ke donon pradarshan ek shrunkhlaa main nahin hui he, 1973 ke liv and let daai main pehla pradarshan he jabaki doosraa 1989 main license tu kil main he
 For the first time, Leiter was played by a three-time african-american actor in the non-eon film, played by Bernie Casey in Never Again Never Again, while played by Geoffrey Wright in Casino Royal and Quentum of Solace

 timothy dalton kii film main uski upasthiti se kwantem of soles ke pehle aath ioen shrunkhlaa main litre kii upasthit ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Apart from the Dalton film The Living Daylight and the Quantum of Solace, no other short title appeared in the film, and appeared in none of Fleming's short stories
 bond ke khalanaayak adhiktar ghamand se bhare mahakhlanaayak hote hai jo duniya par apana prabhutv kaayam karne kii yojana vaale kuch udyogpati yaa pagal vaigyanik hote hai
 They are often charismatic and intelligent, but at the same time arrogant, overconfident and invite reprimand
 aksar, bond kaa unke saath ek praarambhik yuddh hota he jo ki maukhik yaa kuch sthanon main yaa casino game main hota he
 Bond's victory arouses hatred for 007 in the Mahakhalayanakas
 aksar, bond besharmi se dur karne kii koshash karata he or mahakhlanaayak ke malkin ke saath chhedhkhani karata he, taaki use bachaane or apane dushman par apane purush shreshthata ko maanya karne donon kii koshish karata he
 Ernst Strawrow Blofeld, a worldwide criminal organization Spectre that appears in six of the franchise's films and has been Bond's chief-enemy
 is avasar par, bond ke khalanaayak jameen se jude charitra hai jaise ek dawa / hathiyaar taskar yaa anya aparaadhiyon ko paise aapurtikarta ke rup main he
 For example, both of Timothy Dolton's Bond films do not have a specific Bond Mahakhalnayak
 mishan ke kisi bindu par, bond kii mulaaqaat mukhya bond kanya se hoti he, ek charitra jo bond kii premika hoti he yaa uski mukhya yon vastu hoti he
 There is always a Bond girl at the center of the plot and often one or two others who collide with her, whether they help her or not
 ve bond dwaara bachaai gai peedit ho sakati hai athwa sahyogi, agent, khalanayika, yaa gurga ho sakati hai
 Many of these investigate the matter with Bond as Honey Rider is a passive participant in such missions
 adhik aam taur par, bond kanyaon kaa kathanak ko aage le jane main mahatv ek film se duusari film main bhinn hota he
 Five of the Bond girls are "bad" girls, who usually become "good" by Bond's influence
 
 kuch maamalon main, bond kuch mahilaon ko paksh badalane ke liye prerit karata he or vifal rahata he
 In The World Is Not Enough, the villain is a woman who fails to captivate Bond to join his side
 fleming kii do bond kanyaayein - gaala brands or vivianne mishael- keval upanyaas main dikhaai detii hai
 They are replaced by separate Bond girls in their respective films and together most or all of the original plot of the book is new

 Acharya Abhinavagupta mentions Lollat in "abhinavabharati" as Acharya, a recognized commentator on Bharatamuni's Natyasutra
 bharat ke rasaparak siddhant kii vyakhya karanevaale sarvapratham vidvan lollat hi hai
 His independent opinion in relation to Rasnipatti is well known in literature
 ye mimasak or abhidhaavaadi the
 In his opinion, every meaning of the word is counteracted by affection, just as the same arrow pierces the body and penetrates the body and drinks the souls

 According to his statement, meaning is not the end of the community, but the meaning of the meaning of the word in poetry is proper and full, and not monotonous
 koi bhi varnan saras bhale hi ho, kintu yadi vah prakrut ras ke saath saamanjasy nahin rakhata to iskaa vistaar nahin karnaa chahie
 In epics, the registration of Yamak and Chitrakavya signifies the pride of the poet, it is not a manifestation of the main rasa of poetry

 Imperialism is the view that an ambitious nation exerts control over the natural and human resources of other countries in order to increase its power and pride

 Under imperialist policy, a nation-state goes outside its borders and interferes with other countries and states

 Lenin wrote in his 1916 book "the Final Phase of Imperialism Capitalism" that imperialism is a fixed economic state that arises during the peak development of capitalism
 jin rashtron main poonjeevaad kaa charamavikas nahin hua vahaan samrajyavad ko hi lenin ne samaajawaadee kranti kii purvavela mana he
 According to Charles A
 Baird, "imperialism is the desire and policy of civilized nations to rule over weak and backward people
" " In the 15th-16th century, the era of colonial empires came as a result of geographical exploration
 is samrajyavaadee yug ko do bhaagon main baant kar adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he- purana samrajyavad or naveen samrajyavad
 The beginning of old imperialism can be traced back to around the 15th century when Spain and Portugal made a move to the region
 samrajyavad kaa yah daur 18veen shatabdi ke ant tak chalaa
 Spain and Portugal discovered all the countries and established their trading posts there
 dhire-dhire france or england ne bhi is disha main kadam badhaayaa
 The colonial empire of England became established throughout the world
 19veen shatabdi main is samrajyavad ne naveen rup dharna kiya
 After 1890 CE, imperialist sentiment emerged in a new form in the countries of Europe
 yah nav samrajyavad pehle ke upniveshwaad se aarthik or raajnneetik drushti se bhinn tha
 The old imperialism was commercialist, be it India or China or Southeast Asia
 europea vyapaaree sthaneey saudagaron se unka maal kharidte the
 European nations were not hungry for state or land, except for the protection of offices and trading centers at some places to protect the routes
 nav samrajyavad ke daur main ab suniyojit dhang se europea desh pichde ilaakon main pravesh kar un par prabhutv jamaane lage
 In these areas, he invested capital, started farming on a large scale, established minerals and other industries, developed means of communication and transportation and also intervened in cultural life
 apane prashasit ilaaka kii paramparaagat arthvyavastha or utpaadan arthvyavastha ko vinasht karke bahusankhyak sthaneey logon kii videshi maalikon par ashrith bana diya
 Colonialism and imperialism appear to have a distinct difference
 upniveshwaad, samrajyavad se adhik jatil he kyonki yah upniveshwaad ke adheen rah rahe mul nivaasiyon ke jivan par gaharaa tathaa vyapak prabhaav daalata he
 It includes the social, economic, political and cultural control of the people of the colonial power on the one hand, the people of the colonies on the one hand and the system of political rule on the imperial states on the other
 is tarah samrajyavad main mul rup se rajnatik niyantran kii vyavastha he vahiin upniveshwaad aupniveshik rajya ke logo dwaara vijit logon ke jivan tathaa samskruti par apana prabhutv sthapit karne kii vyavastha he
 While the use of military power and war is often fixed for the spread of imperialism, the use of power is not mandatory in colonialism

 africa ke pashchimi tat se dakshin atlantic ko paar karke jamaica yaa barbados pahunch kar daason ke badale shira praapt kiya jaataa tha or yah shira ant main new england pahunchaaya jaataa tha
 Another notable example of the trade triangle is that goods manufactured in Bristol or Liverpool were taken to Africa where slaves were exchanged
 in daason ke badale main virginia se tambaakoo praapt kar ise england le jaakar mahadwipiya bazaaron main bechaa jaataa tha
 It is estimated that 85 to 90 thousand Africans were sold annually across the Atlantic under the slave trade in the 18th century

 During the 18th century, the slave trade contributed significantly to the rapid commercial growth rate of France, Britain, and the United States, causing the governments of European countries to be reluctant to abolish the slave trade

 The following arguments can be presented in opposition to independent trade- samrajyavad apane paramparaagat swaroop main to ab lagbhag samaapt ho chukaa he parantu yah apane ek aadhunik parivesh main athwa paridhaan ke saath abhi bhi jivit he
 Traditional imperialist states, especially the western developed states and the United States, are still working to run the policies of new countries as they wish, through their policies
 shastr daud ko badhaava dekar, shastr aapurti ke dwaara videshi sahaayta ke madhyam se, vishwa aarthik sansthaaon par apane niyantran dwaara, paroksh yuddh niti, antarrashtriya sammelnon main kootneeti dwaara tathaa kai prakaar ke anya dabaav sadhano dwaara, maanav adhikaron ke raksha ke naam par, parmaanu nirastrikaran ke naam par, udaarikaran or vaishvikaran ke naam par, kam shaktishaalee yaa phir vikasshil deshon par apana prabhutv tathaa dabadabaa banaaye rakhane kii niti kaa anusaran kar rahe hai
 This is called neo-imperialism
 yah samrajyavad kaa aadhunik swaroop he
 The end of this form is now the main objective of foreign policies of developing countries
 margentho ke anusaar, jis prakaar vishesh paristhitiyon main teen prakaar ke samrajyavad hai tathaa apane lakshya ke anusaar bhi teen prakaar ke samrajyavad hote hai, usee prakaar samrajyavaadee nitiyon ke sadhano main bhi teen prakaar kii vibhinnataayen sthapit kerani chahie
 These tools are mainly called military, economic and cultural imperialism
 vastav main to sainik samrajyavad sainik vijay lakshith karata he, aarthik samrajyavad anya logon kaa aarthik shoshan tathaa saanskrithik samrajyavad ek prakaar kii samskruti kaa duusari samskruti dwaara hataaya janaa lakshith karata he parantu ye sab sadaa ek hi samrajyavad lakshya ke saadhan ke rup main kaam karte he
 Military imperialism is the most obvious, ancient and oppressive method of empire building
 sainik samrajyavad pratyaksh sainik akraman ke dwaara apane lakshya ko praapt karne kaa praytn karti he
 Hitler, Mussolini, Napoleon, Louis Fourteenth and many other rulers used this means of military victory in the modern era
 ek samrajyavaadee raashtra ke drushtikon se is paddati kaa laabh yah he ki sainik vijay ke falswaroop jo naye shakti sambandh sthapit hote hai, unhen parajeet raashtra dwaara bhadakaate hue anya yuddh dwaara hi badla ja saktaa he or is yuddh main safalataa kii sambhaavna praayah us parajeet raashtra kii utani nahin hoti, jitani samrajyavaadee raashtra kii hoti he
 Generally, war has a great importance in this kind of empire building
 sikandar, nepolian evam hitler sabhi ne samrajya nirmaan main yuddh kaa sahaara liya
 It is fitting that where war creates empire, defeat in war also leads to disintegration of empire, just as Nazi Germany started war for its imperialist goals but in the process lost its power and He even became a victim of other imperialist powers himself
 kamjor tathaa nirdhan rashtron par samrajya sthapit karne ke liye shreshth aarthik shakti kaa prayog karnaa, samrajyavad kaa sabase tarksangat saadhan he
 In Margentho's words, "economic imperialism is less ruthless and less effective than the military system in general and is the production of the modern age of gaining power as a rational means
" " aarthik samrajyavad kii niti kii aam visheshtaayen duusare rashtron par aarthik niyantran praapt karnaa he
 By economic means, imperial power controls the finances of other nations, resulting in control of policies
 udhaaharan ke liye madhya amareeki ganatantr sabhi prabhusatta sampann rajya hai parantu bahut seemaa tak unka aarthik jivan sanyukt rajya america se aayaat par nirbhar hota he
 This makes it possible for the United States to control these countries
 ye raashtra koi bhi aisi niti, chaahe gharelu niti ho yaa videsh niti, lambe samay tak lagu nahin rakh sakate, jis par sanyukt rajya america ko aapatti ho
 The economic empire is in line with today's mechanical and capitalist expansion era
 iskaa aadhunik vilakshan udhaaharan "dollar samrajyavad" he
 "oil diplomacy" is also a form of economic imperialism
 videshi nivesh, aarthik sahaayta, rin, bahurashtriya nigam, vyapaar tathaa takneekee ekadhikaar or duusare aise sadhano dwaara dhani tathaa shaktishaalee raashtra asia, africa tathaa latinap america, jinhen aam bhashaa main “teesraa vishwa” kaha jaataa he, ke nirdhan rashtron par aarthik samrajyavad hi lagu kar rahe hai
 These nations, which are providing economic aid and loans to underdeveloped nations, have their real objective behind them, to control their economy and consequently control their internal and foreign policies
 aviksit raashtra raajnneetik rup main swatantra or kanoonee taur par purna prabhusatt sampann rajya hai parantu aarthik rup main ye rajya aaj bhi dhani viksit rajyon par, jo paramparaagat samrajyavaadee shaktiyaan thim, nirbhar karte hai
 In this politically independent and economic form, dependence is called neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism
 aarthik samrajyavad nav-samrajyavad kaa mukhya upkaran he
 Military imperialism reverses power relations by military conquest and economic imperialism achieves this through economic control
 saanskrithik samrajyavad, yathapurv sthiti ko badalane kaa praytn karata he tathaa shakti sambandhon ko maanav ke mastishk par niyantran ke dwaara ulatney kaa praytn karata he
 Its aim is to control the minds of the people of other nations by the superiority of its culture, ideology and lifestyle of imperial power
 saanskrithik samrajyavad, samrajyavaadee shakti kii samskruti tathaa vichaardhaara kii shreshthata kaa pratipaadan tathaa prachaar dwaara dusron ko prabhavit karke, rajya kii shakti ko manovaigyanik saadhan dwaara vistrut karne kaa ek vilakshan tathaa sookshm saadhan he
 Neither military power nor economic pressure is used in this instrument of imperialism, but it is the most effective and permanent successful means of achieving the goals of imperialism
 saanskrithik niyantran samaaj ke us varg par hota he, jo us desh kaa shashan evam niti-nirmaataa netritv varg hota he
 Cultural imperialism generally comes as an aid to military or economic imperialism
 iskaa ek pramukh aadhunik udhaaharan he, jiskaa prayog dwitiya vishwayuddh ke purv austria main kiya gaya, jabaki vahaan najivadi sarkaar ne german phujon ko desh par kabja karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The Fifth Line of Nazis also achieved considerable success in France and Norway as many influential citizens within and outside the government became traitors
 ve naaji darshan or uske anterrashtriya lakshyon ke anuyaayi ho gayi
 Margentho considered the spread of communist ideology in various countries of the world after 1917 as an expression of cultural imperialism
 sanyukt rajya america jab asia or africa ke deshon main apane sahitya kaa vishaal maatra main prachaar karata he, to uskaa mukhya lakshya saanskrithik samrajyavad kaa prasar hota he
 Cultural imperialism was adopted only to enhance colonial policies
 iskaa uddeshy duusare deshon kii janata ke aatm sammaan ko nasht karnaa tathaa hameshaa ke liye unamem gulaami kii bhaavana ko bharna he

 Therefore, by his far-sighted thinking, he made an unusual attempt to tie the country together by making a detailed plan

 saarvajanin hit or mahaan dhyey kii purti main prajatantr yaa lokshikshan anivaary he, par paryaapt nahin aisa unka spasht mat tha
 Teachers, scholars and defenders of the country - should be disinterested, clever and courageous

 In reality
 1
 jis prakaar sabhi parvaton par mani nahin milti, sabhi haathiyon ke mastak main moti utpann nahin hota, sabhi wanon main chandan kaa vriksh nahin hota, usee prakaar sajjan purush sabhi jagahon par nahin milte hai
 2
 Lying, rash, daring, deception, foolish act, greed, profanity and cruelty - these are the natural faults of women
 chanakya uparyukt dosha ko striyon kaa swaabhaavik gun maanate hai
 However, these defects cannot be rightly said in the educated women of the present era
 3
 bhojan ke liye achche padaarthon kaa uplabdh hona, unhen pachaane kii shakti kaa hona, sundar stri ke saath sansarg ke liye kaamashkti kaa hona, prachur dhan ke saath-saath dhan dene kii ichha hona
 Human beings get all these pleasures with great difficulty
 4
 chanakya kehete hai ki jis vyakti kaa putr uske niyantran main rahata he, jisaki patni ajna ke anusaar aacharan karti he or jo vyakti apane kamaaye dhan se puri tarah santusht rahata he
 For such a person, this world is like heaven
 5
 chanakya kaa maananaa he ki vahi gruhasthi sukhi he, jisaki santan unki ajna kaa paalan karti he
 It is also the duty of the father to take good care of his sons
 isi prakaar aise vyakti ko mitra nahin kaha ja saktaa he, jis par vishwaas nahin kiya ja sake or aisi patni vyarth he jisase kisi prakaar kaa sukh praapt na ho
 6
 It is good to abandon the friend who talks smooth in front of you and spoils your work behind your back
 chanakya kehete hai ki vah us barttan ke samaan he, jiske upar ke hisse main doodh laga he parantu andar vish bharaa hua hota he
 7
 Chanakya says that a person who is not a good friend should not believe in it, but at the same time one should not have full faith in the relation of a good friend, because if he gets angry, he can reveal all your differences
 at: saavdhaanee atyant aavashyak he
 8
 Chanakya believes that a person should never open his mind
 use jo bhi kaary karnaa he, use apane man main rakhe or puri tanmayata ke saath samay aane par use puraa karnaa chahie
 9
 Chanakya says that like foolishness, youth is also painful because in youth, one can do any foolish act in the impulse of sex
 parantu inase bhi adhik kshtdaayak he dusron par ashrith rahanaa
 10
 Chanakya says that as children are taught in childhood, they develop in the same way
 isliye mata-pita kaa kartavya he ki ve unhen aise maarg par chalaaen, jisase unamem uttam charitra kaa vikaas ho kyonki guni vyaktiyon se hi kul kii shobhaa badhati he

 Those parents are like enemies to their children, who did not provide good education to the children
 kyonki anpadh balak kaa vidwaanon ke samooh main usee prakaar apmaan hota he jaise hanson ke jhund main bagule kii sthiti hoti he
 a person without education is like an animal without tail, so it is the duty of parents to give such education to children so that they can beautify the society
 12
 chanakya kehete hai ki adhik laad pyaar karne se bacchon main anek dosha utpann ho jate hai
 So if they do something wrong then it is not appropriate to ignore and be pampered
 bachche ko daantna bhi aavashyak he
 13
 Explaining the importance of education and study, Chanakya says that man is born very fortunate, so we should use more and more of our time in the study of Vedadi scriptures and good works like charity
 14
 jis prakaar patni ke viyog kaa dukh, apane bhai-bandhuon se praapt apmaan kaa dukh asahneeya hota he, usee prakaar karj se dabaa vyakti bhi har samay dukhi rahata he
 The servant who is in the service of the evil king also remains unhappy
 nirdhantaa kaa abhishaap bhi manushya kabhi nahin bhula paata
 With this, the soul of a person keeps on burning inside
 15
 chanakya ke anusaar nadi ke kinare sthit vrikshon kaa jivan anishchit hota he, kyonki nadiyaan baadh ke samay apane kinare ke pedo ko ujaad detii hai
 Similarly, a woman living in other homes can also go on the path of collapse at some time
 isi tarah jis raja ke paas acchhee salaah dene vaale mantri nahin hote, vah bhi bahut samay tak surakshit nahin rah saktaa
 There should be no doubt in this
 16
 chanakya kehete hai ki jis tarah veshya dhan ke samaapt hone par purush se munh mode leti he
 Similarly, when the king becomes powerless, the subjects leave him
 isi prakaar vrikshon par rahane vaale pakshi bhi tabhi tak kisi vriksh par baseraa rakhte hai, jab tak vahaan se unhen fal praapt hote rahete hai
 When the guest is fully welcomed, he also leaves the house
 17
 bure charitra vaale, akaaran dusron ko haani pahunchaane vaale tathaa ashuddh sthaan par rahane vaale vyakti ke saath jo purush mitrataa karata he, vah sheeghra hi nasht ho jaataa he

 ve kehete hai ki manushya kii bhalaai isi main he ki vah jitani jaldi ho sake, dusht vyakti kaa saath chhod de
 18
 Chanakya says that it is better to do friendship only with people who are equal

 Since it was often the practice of staying barefoot, people had to face many difficulties in reaching their residence

 ek vyakti unase nivedan karte hue bolaa, ‘aapke paas pahunchane main ham logon ko bahut ksht hua
 You should ask Maharaj to arrange the land covered with leather
 isse logon ko aaraam hoga
 After listening to him, Chanakya said with a smile, "sir, laying the leather here will not solve the problem
" contile va patharile path to is vishwa main anginat hai
 In such a situation, it is impossible to lay leather all over the world
 haa, yadi aap log chamade dwaara apane pairon ko surakshit kar len to avashya hi patharile path va contili jhaadiyon ke prakope se batch sakate hai
 'that person bowed his head and said,' Yes guruji, i will do the same now
 ’ After this Chanakya said, 'look, there is a deep essence behind this thing of mine
 dusron ko sudhaarney ke bajaay khud ko sudhaaro
 With this you will definitely get victory in your work
 duniya ko naseehat dene vaala kuch nahin kar paata jabaki uskaa swayan paalan karne vaala kamyaabi kii bulandiyon tak pahunch jaataa he

 rajdoot chanakya ke vyavhaar se prasann hua
 In the evening when he started asking about 'amatya Niwas' in the Rajmahal complex
 raaj prahari ne bataaya- acharya chanakya to nagar ke baahar rahete hai
 The Ambassador thought that perhaps the General Minister would have a beautiful palace built on the lake outside the city
 rajdoot nagar ke baahar pahuncha
 Asked a citizen where to live Chanakya
 ek kutiyaa kii ore ishaara karte hue naagarik ne kaha-dekhie, vah saamne mahaamantri kii kutiyaa he
 The ambassador was surprised
 usne kutiyaa main pahunchakar chanakya ke paanv chhue or shikaayat kii-aap jaisaa chatur mahaamantri ek kutiyaa main rahata he

 It was here that his first work, Childhood, was produced in 1852, which was published in a letter titled "tie Contemporari" under the name of LT

 The education system of this school was very progressive

 The school was a big success mainly due to Tolstoy's leadership power and heartfelt passion towards him

 In 1862, Tolstoy was married to a high-ranking elite woman named Safia Berhus
 unke vaivaahik jivan kaa purvaash to bada sukhad rahaa par uttaransh katutapurna beetaa
 In Tolstoy's married life, the ideal of a housewife was completely similar to that of an Indian housewife: but the views of the then Russian elite society were quite different
 1863 se 1869 tak tollstoy kaa samay "waar and pis" kii rachana main evam 1873 se 76 tak kaa samay "anna karenina" kii rachana main beetaa
 Both these compositions greatly elevated Tolstoy's literary fame

 The period from 1875 to 1879 was very disappointing for him - he had lost his faith in God and had taken off on committing suicide

 In 1878–79, he composed his controversial work called "confession"

 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"

 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia
 apni patni ko maatr utana ansh lene kii unhone anumati di jitna parivaar ke bhar poshan ke liye anivaary tha
 He gave all the proceeds of his novel called 'resurgence' to the Russian pacifist caste Dukhbor people to abandon Russia and settle in Canada

 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body

 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life
 niruddeshy, vichaarheen ore aatmakendrit jivan ko ve ek prakaar kaa paap maanate the; yahan tak ki sambhog ko ve keval santanotpatti ke uddeshy se hi vihit maanate the
 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 Volcanic experts have described many types of volcanic eruptions
 inkaa namakaran praayah prasiddh jwalamukhiyon ke naam par kiya gaya he jisamen usee prakaar kaa vyavhaar dekhne ko mila tha
 Several types of volcanic eruptions — during which lava, tephra, and mixed gases are expelled from volcanic vents or fissures — have been distinguished by volcanologists
 inhen aksar prasiddh jwalamukhi ke naam par rakhaa jaataa he jahaan us prakaar kaa vyavhaar dekha gaya he
 Some may exhibit only one particular type of eruption during a period of volcanic activity, while others may display all types of complete sequences in an eruptive chain
 teen alag-alag prakaar ke visphot hote hai
 The best observed is magmatic eruption, which involves decompression of the gas within the magma that drives it forward
 Phreatomagmatic visphot ek or prakaar kaa jwalamukheey visphot he, jo megma ke bheetar gas ke sampeedan se prerit he, prakriya ke pratyaksh vipareet megmatic gatividhi ko shakti detaa he
 The third explosive type is fire blast, which is driven by the overheating of steam through contact with magma; These explosive types often exhibit no magmatic release , due to the current rock grains

 The weakest are the Hawaiian and submarine, then the Strombolians, followed by the Vulcanians and the Suresians
 majboot visphotak prakaar pellen visphot hote hai, iske baad plinian visphot hote hai; sabase majboot visphoton ko "ultra-plinian" kaha jaataa he
 Subglacial and phreatic eruptions are defined by their explosive mechanisms, and vary in strength
 visphotak takat kaa ek mahatvapurn upaay jwalamukheey visphotak suchakank he, jo 0 se 8 tak ke aayam paimaane kaa kram hota he jo praayah visphotak prakaaron se sambandhit hota he
 The volcanic eruption index scales from 0 to 8 to measure the strength of the explosive

 Hawaiian eruption is a type of volcanic eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcano with which this explosive name is a type hallmark
 hawaiyan visphot jwalamukheey ghatnaon ke sabase shant prakaar hai, jo kam gasiy saamagree vaale bahut taral padaarth besalt-prakaar vaale lava, ke prabhaavshaalee visphot se visheshit he
 The amount of material ejected from the Hawaiian eruption is less than half that of other volcanic types
 lava kii sthir maatra kaa utpaadan vyapak dhaal vaale va bade jwalamukhi parvat kaa nirmaan karata he
 Explosives do not remain centered on the main peak, as with other volcanic types, and often from fissure vents around the summit and out of the center
 hawaiyan visphot aksar fisher vent ke saath, ek pankti ke rup main shuru hote hai, jise praayah aag ke parde ke naam se jaanate hai
 ye lava kuch vents,chhidron, par kendrit hona shuru ho jate hai
 Mouth gates meanwhile, often take the form of large lava fountains, which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more

 If explosive rates are high enough, they can also create splatter-fed lava flows
 hawaiyan visphot aksar bahut lambey samay tak rahete hai; kilaua kaa ek sinder shanku puu'oo, 1983 se lagaataar visphot kar rahaa he
 Another Hawaiian volcanic feature is the formation of active lava lakes, currently there are only 6 such lakes in the world, and Kupianaha vent of Kilauea is one of them

 The King Hastinapur Shantanu and Rani Satyavati had two sons named Chitrangad and Vichitravirya
 shantanu kaa swargvaas chitrangad or vichitraveery ke balykaal main hi ho gaya tha isaliye unka paalan poshan bhishma ne kiya
 Bhishma installed Chitrangad on the throne as he grew up, but in a short period, Chitrangad was killed while fighting with Gandharvas
 is par bhishma ne unke anuj vichitraveery ko rajya saunp diya
 Now Bhishma was worried about the marriage of Vichitravirya
 unheen dinon kashiraj kii teen kanyaon, amba, ambika or ambalika kaa swayamvar hone vaala tha
 Going to his swayamvara, Bhishma alone defeated all the kings who came there and after killing all the three girls brought them to Hastinapur
 badi kanya amba ne bhishma ko bataaya ki vah apana tan-man raaj shalve ko arpit kar chuki he
 On hearing this, Bhishma sent him to King Shalva and got Ambika and Ambalika married to Vichitravirya
 raja shalve ne amba ko grahan nahin kiya atah vah hastinapur laut kar aa gai or bhishma se boli, "he arya! aap mujhe har kar laaye hai atev aap mujhase vivaah karen
 "but Bhishma did not accept his request because of his promise
 amba rusht ho kar parashuram ke paas gai or unase apni vyathaa suna kar sahaayta maangi
 Parshuram said to Amba, "oh God! Don't worry, i will get you married with Bhishma
 " parashuram ne bhishma ko bulaava bheja kintu bhishma unke paas nahin gayi
 Angry at this, Parashurama reached Bhishma and a terrible war broke out between the two heroes

 After all, the Gods intervened and ended this war

 Vichitravirya indulged in indulgence with both her queens, but she had no children with both queens and died of tuberculosis
 ab kul naash hone ke bhay se mata satyavati ne ek din bhishma se kaha, "putr! is vansh ko nasht hone se bachaane ke liye meri ajna he ki tum in donon raniyon se putr utpann karo
 "hearing Mata, Bhishma said," Mother! i cannot break my vows under any circumstances
 " Mother Satyavati felt very sad to hear this

 As soon as he remembered, Ved Vyas appeared there
 satyavati unhen dekh kar boleen, "he putr! tumhaare sabhi bhai nihsantaan hi swargavaasi ho gayi
 Therefore, to save my descendants from perishing, i command you to produce children from their wives
 " vedavyas unki ajna maan kar bole, "mata! aap un donon raniyon se kah dijiye ki ve ek varsh tak niyam vrath kaa paalan karte rahen tabhi unako garbh dhaaran hoga
 "after a year had passed, Ved Vyasa first went to the great queen Ambika
 ambika ne unke tej se dar kar apane netra band kar liye
 Returning to Ved Vyas, he said to Mata, "mata Ambika will have a great son, but he will be blind due to the defect of closing the eyes
 " satyavati ko yah sun kar atyant dukh hua or unhone vedavyas ko choti rani ambalika ke paas bheja
 Ambalika was pale in fear upon seeing Ved Vyasa
 uske kaksh se lautne par vedavyas ne satyavati se kaha, "mata! ambalika ke garbh se pandu rog se grasit putr hoga
 "this made Mata Satyavati even more sad and she ordered the elder queen Ambika to go to Ved Vyasa again
 is baar badi rani ne swayan na ja kar apni daasi ko vedavyas ke paas bhej diya
 Maid pleasantly got Ved Vyas
 is baar vedavyas ne mata satyavati ke paas aa kar kaha, "maate! is daasi ke garbh se veda-veydant main paarangat atyant nitivaan putr utpann hoga
 "saying this, Ved Vyas went to penance

 No definitive classification of emotions exists, although several classifications have been proposed
 inamen se kuch vargeekaran hai: The related difference between emotion and the consequences of emotion is the main behavioral and emotional expression
 apni bhaavnaatmak sthiti ke parinamswaroop aksar log kai tarah kii abhivyaktiyaan karte hai, jaise ronaa, ladanaa yaa ghrinaa karnaa
 yadi koi bina koi sambandhit abhivyakti ke bhaavana prakat kare to ham maan sakate hai kii bhaawanaaon ke liye abhivyakti kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Neuroscientific research suggests that there is a "magic quarter second" during which the thought can be known before an emotional response is formed
 us pal main, vyakti bhaavana ko niyantrit kar saktaa he
 The James – Lang theory states that experiences of bodily changes result in large-scale emotion sensations
 bhaawanaaon ke prati kriyaatmak drushtikon, se pataa chalata he ki bhavanaaen kisi vishesh kriya ke falswaroop ek vishay ke rup main surakshit rakhane ke liye ubhari hai
 There are some basic and complex categories, where some basic emotions can be converted into somewhat complex emotions
 In a situation, complex emotions can arise due to cultural conditions or alliances associated with basic emotions
 vaikalpik rup se, mul rangon ke mishran ke anuroop,mul bhavanaaen maanav kii bhaawanaaon ke anubhav se mil kar bhaawanaaon kaa purna indradhanush bana sakati hai
 For example a mixture of mutual anger and hatred can lead to contempt
 robert plutchik ne ek triayami "sarkamplex model" prastaavit kiya he jo bhaawanaaon ke bich sambandhon ko darshata he
 This model is similar to a colored circle
 lambavat maap tivrata ko darshaate hai or sarkal bhaawanaaon ke bich samanta kii degree bataata he
 They arranged the eight primary emotions into pairs of four opposite emotions
 kuch log meta imoshans ke astitv ke bare main bhi tark dete hai jo bhaawanaaon ke bare main bhavanaaen hai
 Another meaning of specific emotions is related to their timing
 kuch bhavanaaen kuch second kii hoti hai, jabaki kuch kai saalon tak rah sakati hai 
 baad vaali ko ek lambi avadhi kii pravriti ke rup main mana ja saktaa he jisame ek uchit bhaavana kii bajaay keval kisi ke prati lagaav kii bhaavana he 
 bhaavnaatmak ghatnaon or bhaavnaatmak swabhaavon ke bich antar he
 Temperament is also comparable on the basis of character traits in which one's disposition usually varies according to the experience of particular emotions for different objects
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek chidchida vyakti aam taur par dusron kii bajaay jaldi athwa tezi se chidh jaataa he
 Finally, some researchers classify emotions into a general category of 'affective state', where affect / aroused situations also include emotion-related events such as happiness and pain, emotional conditions, mood, mood, and symptoms

 Researchers concluded that when experiencing hatred, a specific figure forms in people's brains
 saanchaa:emotion Theories related to emotions carry the ideas of ancient Greece to Plato and Aristotle
 hamen rene descartes, barook spinoja or david hum jaise darshanikon ke kaam ke rup main parishkrut siddhant bhi milte hai
 Later theories related to emotions have resulted from advances in research
 zyaadaatar siddhant alag nahin hai or kai shodhakartaaon ne apane kaam main vibhinn drushtikon shaamil kiye hai
 According to the somatic theory of emotions, the body reacts directly to emotions rather than to essential judgments
 is tarah ke siddhanton kaa pehla aadhunik sanskaran 1880 main wiliam james ne prastut kiya
 The theory lost support in the 20th century, but recently it has gained popularity again as a result of neurological evidence from researchers such as John Cachioppo, Antonio Damasio, Joseph E
 Leidu and Robert E
 Zajonc
 wiliam james ne ek lekh 'whot iz en imoshan?', ke dwaara yah tark diya ki zyaadaatar bhaavnaatmak anubhav shaareerik badlaavon ke kaaran hote hai
 Around this time Danish psychologist Karl Lang also introduced a similar theory, so it is known as the James – Lang theory
 is siddhant or iske tathyon ke anusaar, paristhiti ke badalane se shaareerik badlaav hota he
 As James puts it, "the concept of physical change is emotion"
 James claims that "we feel sad because we cry, angry during a fight, afraid to tremble, and it may happen that, in an apology, we do not cry during anger or fear
" Fight or shiver is siddhant ko prayogon dwaara sabit kiya gaya he, jisame sharir kii sthitiyon main badlaav laa kar vaanchit bhaavana praapt kii jaati he
 This type of experiment has also been used in medicine
 james-lang's theory is often misunderstood because it is contradictory
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki bhavanaaen, bhaavana sambandhit kriyaaon ko badhaava detii hai : jaise "main ro rahaa hoon kyonki main udhaas hoon", yaa "main bhaaga kyonki main dar gaya"
 iske vipareet, james-laing kaa siddhant jor detaa he ki ham pehle sthiti ke anusaar pratikriya karte hai or iske baad ham apni kriyaaon ko bhaavnaatmak pratikriya se jodate hai
 In this way, emotions explain and organize our own actions
 james-laing ke siddhant ko ab zyaadaatar chaatro dwaara nakaar diya gaya he
 According to the following statement by Tim Dalgleish: The james-lang theory has remained influential
 Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity
 Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james-lang view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion
" a problem with james-lang's theory is that it focuses on the consequences of action, not on the physical effects of emotional experiences
 
 mastishk sanrachana kii tantrikaon kii masping se mili jaankaree se, maanav bhaawanaaon kii neurobiological vyakhya yah he ki bhaavana ek priy yaa apriy sthiti he jostandhari ke mastishk main paidaa hoti he
 If it is compared to reptiles, the development of emotions will be similar to the transformation of normal bone animals into mammals, in which the neurochemical fluctuates according to the level of brain activity, which causes the body to move, mood swings
 And is reflected in the postures
 udhaaharan ke liye, pyaar kii bhaavana ko standhari ke mastishk ke peleocircuit kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he, jisase dekhbhaal, bhojan karaane or sondarya jaisi bhaawanaaon kaa bodh hota he
 Paleosurkits are a means of displaying bodily emotions by nerves that were formed millions of years before the cortical nerve was formed
 isamen pehle se bane hue raste yaa mastishk ke agle hisse, brain stem tathaa meru rajoumein tantrika koshikaon kaa jaal hota he
 They originated even before the ancestors of mammals to control actions, almost around the time of jawless fish
 mana jaataa he ki, standhari ke mastishk ke viksit hone se pehle, jaanwaron kii zindagi, swachaalit, sachet or nappi tuli thi
 The body of reptiles responds to sensory signals of vision, voice, touch, chemistry, gravity, with predetermined body movements and postures
 raat main sakriy hone vaale stanadhariyon ke aagaman ke saath, lagbhag 180 million varsh pehle, gandh ne ek prabhavi tantrika ke rup main drushti kaa sthaan le liya or soonghney vaali tantrika ke madhyam se pratikriya karne ke or raste bane, jo ki mana jaataa he ki aage chal kar stanadhariyon kii bhaawanaaon or bhaavnaatmak yaaddaasht ke rup main viksit hue
 jurassic kaal main, stanadhariyon ne sarisrupon kii tulana main apni soonghney kii kshamta kaa safaltaapurvak upyog kiya - isiilie stanadhariyon ke mastishk kighran tantrika kaa bhaag sarisrupon kii tulana main bada hota he
 These odors slowly became the blueprint of nerves, which later formed the structure of our brain
 mana jaataa he ki bhavanaaen mastishk ke us kshetra kii kaaryashiltaa se sambandhit he jo hamen nirdesh detaa he, hamaare vyavhaar ko prerit karata he or hamaare ird gird hone vaali ghatnaon ke mahatva kii vyakhya karata he
 Important discoveries by Broca, Papez, and mclean suggest that emotions are associated with a group of structures in the middle of the brain called the limbic system, including the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures
 haal hi main hue anusandhanon se pataa chalaa he ki isamen se kuch limbik sanrachanaayen, dusron ke vipareet, bhaawanaaon se us tarah se sidhi nahin judi hai jabaki kuch gaiyr limbik sanrachanaayen adhik mahatv kii pai gayin hai
