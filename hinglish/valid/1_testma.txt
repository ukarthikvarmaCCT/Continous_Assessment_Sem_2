 The credit for initiating the academic study of public administration goes to Woodrow Wilson, who in his article 'the Study of Administration' published in 1887, stressed the need to develop the scientific basis of this scripture
 is lekh main raajnneeti tathaa prashasan ke bich spasht bhinnata dikhaai gai or ghoshit kiya gaya ki prashasan kii raajnneeti se dur rahanaa chahie
 This is called the so-called 'politics-administration-dichotomy'
 lok prashasan kaa itihaas nimnlikhit 5 charnon main vibhajya he- Public administration as a subject was born in 1887
 america ke princeton uniwarsity main raajnneetishastra ke tatkaaleen praadhyaapak woodro wilson ko is shaastra kaa janak mana jaataa he
 In his article 'study of Administration' published in 1887, he described politics and administration separately, saying - "the construction of a constitution is simple but it is very difficult to run it
 " unhone is ‘chalaane’ ke kshetra ke adhyayan par bal diya jo spashtatah ‘prashasan’ hi he
 He made a distinction between politics and administration
 san 1887 main wilson ke lekh ke prakaashan ke saath vastav main ek aise nae yug kaa janm hua jisamen dhire-dhire lok-prashasan adhyayan ke ek nae kshetra ke rup main viksit hua
 It is worth mentioning here that special attention was given to the study of public administration in the United States as compared to other countries
 vahaan prashasan ek vigyaan ke rup main viksit hua he jiske adhyayan ke liye log prabandh vidyalayon main pravesh lete hai
 Another important proponent of this subject is Frank Goodnau, who in his book 'politics and Administration', published in 1900, presented the argument that politics and administration are different because where politics represents the will of the state, administration is concerned with this desire or Is from the implementation of state policies
 vastav main yah vah samay tha jab america main sarkari kshetra main shithilataa or bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha or falswaroop sarkaar-sudhaar ke aandolan chal rahe the
 In this reform-aspirated environment, the teaching and teaching of public administration started in many schools
 1914 main america raajnneeti vigyaan sangh ne apni ek report main kaha ki sarkaar main kaam karne ke liye kushal vyaktiyon kii purti karnaa raajnneetishastra ke adhyayan kaa ek lakshya he
 As a result, public administration became a major part of political science and its study-teacher received huge encouragement
 san 1926 main el
di
 hnite kii pustak 'lok-prashasan ke adhyayan kii bhoomika' prakashit hui
 It was the first textbook of public administration expressing confidence in the separation of political-administration and the author expressed his belief that efficiency and economy are the main goals of public administration
 hnite kii pustak ke anek sanskaran prakashit ho chuke hai or vah aaj bhi prachlan main hi nahin he, balki ise lok prashasan kii mahatvapurn kriti mana jaataa he
 This first phase of the development of public administration has two main characteristics - the rise of public administration and the belief in the separation of political and administration
 lok-prashasan ke itihaas main dwitiya charan kaa prarambh ham dablyoo
 epa
 vilobi kii pustak ‘lok-prashasan ke siddhant’ se maan sakate hai
 Willoughby propounded that there are many principles in public administration that public administration can be improved by implementing them
 vastav main yah kehane main koi atishyokti nahin hogi ki hnite or vilobi ke donon pravartak granthon ne lok-prashasan sambandhi pathyapustakon ke pranayan or use adhyayan kii paddati kaa nirdhaaran kiya
 The form of both these books is technical in which all the common problems of those types have been studied, which can be contained in the word 'posadcarb'
 in pustakon main prashaskeey adhyayan ke vishisht kshetra main uthne vaali vishay-vastu sambandhi samasyaon kaa varnan nahin miltaa he
 Both these promotive texts are based on the belief that public administration should be separate and independent from politics and that its principles can be broadly identified and defined easily
 vilobi kii uparokt pustak ke baad anek vidwaanon ne lok-prashasan par pustaken likhni shuru kin, jinamein kuch ullekhneey naam hai- meri parker folate, henry feol, moonay, raili aadi
 In 1937, Luther Gulick and Urvik together edited an important book on public administration called 'essay on Administration Science'
 dwitiya charan ke in sabhi vidwaanon kii yah manyata rahi ki prashasan main siddhanth hone ke kaaran yah ek vigyaan he or isiilie iske aage 'lok' shabd lagaana uchit nahin he
 The principles apply everywhere, whether it is 'public-sector' or 'private-sector'
 dwitiya charan kii pramukhataa visheshta yahi rahi ki ab is baat par bal diya gaya ki prashasan ke kuch siddhanth he
 This emerged the theoretical form of the subject
 yah sthiti kisi bhi vishay ko samrudh karne ke liye aavashyak maani jaati he
 Now the era of challenging the principles in administration has begun
 san 1938 se 1947 tak kaa charan lok-prashasan ke kshetra main dhwanskaari adhik rahaa
 In 1938, Chester Bernard's book, 'the Work of the Executive' was published in which no theory of administration was described
 san 1946 main harbart ne apane ek lekh main lok-prashasan ke tathakthith siddhanton ko nakaarte hue inhen ‘kivdantiyon’ kii sangya di
 In 1947, Robert Dahal, in one of his articles, tried to prove that public administration is not a science and it has to face three main obstacles in the pursuit of theory - tritiy charan kii pradhanta yahi rahi ki lok-prashasan kaa adhyayan chunautiyon or aalochanaon kaa shikaar bana, jisase is vishay kii nai sambhaavnaayen ujagar hui
 This phase was a revolutionary or 'period of crisis' in the sense that all the achievements of which the public administration was singing were rendered useless
 herbert simon ne jo yuktisangat aalochana kii uske falswaroop ‘siddhantavaadi’ vichaardhaara avishwasaneey prathit hone lagi
 Many doubts arose regarding the nature of public administration, it became a matter of controversy
 isliye 1948 se 1970 ke charan ko lok-prashasan ke ‘swaroop kii sankatavastha’ kaha gaya he
 In this era, public administration broadly adopted two routes - jo vidwaan raajnneetishastra ke antargat aae unka tark tha ki lok-prashasan raajnneeti se niklaa he or uskaa ang he
 Political science was also undergoing some changes at this time and public administration was not being given due importance in it
 swaabhaavik tha ki is sthiti main lok-prashasan sautelepan or akelepan kaa anubhav karne laga
 The alternative to public administration was discovered - 'administrative science'
 lok-prashasan, vyapaar prabandh aadi ne milakar prashasnic vigyaan kii neenv daali
 It has been argued that administration is administration, whether it is in the private sector or in the public sector
 1956 main ‘admistrative scince quarterli’ naamak patrika kaa prakaashan prarambh hua
 In fact, it was very surprising that his 'personal nature' of public administration was hurt
 chaturth charan kii aalochanaayen, pratyaalochanaon or chunautiyon ne kul milakar lok-prashasan kaa bhala kiya
 The study of public administration became well-known, new approaches developed and as a result public publication proceeded on the path of all-round progress
 arthshaastra, samajashaastra, maanavshaastra, manovigyaan aadi vibhinn shastron ke vidwaan or adhyeta lok-prashasan main ruchi lene lage
 From the beginning, the scholar of political science was interested in the study of hilok-administration
 in vibhinn adhyayanon or prayatnon ke falswaroop lok-prashasan ‘antarvishayi’ ban gaya or aaj yah tathy he ki samajashastron main yadi koi vishay sabase adhik ‘antarvishayi’ he to vah lok-prashasan hi he
 This led to the development of scientific form of public administration
 itnaa hi nahin isse lok-prashasan ke kshetra kaa vistaar hota gaya or tulanaatmak lok-prashasan tathaa vikaas prashasan kaa pradurbhaav hua
 Inadequacy of the traditional approach, new tools of research and new social context, international dependency etc
 gave rise to comparative public administration and carried it forward
 lok-prashasan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan ke parinaamon or pravidhiyon kaa samgr lok-prashasan ke swaroop par gambhir prabhaav padaa
 It is encouraging and delightful that today western countries are not only studied in public administration, but also communist countries and countries of Africa and Asia have come under its purview
 lok-prakaashan ek samskruti vishesh ke ghere se nikal kar anya samskritiyon kii ore bhi unmukh hua he jisane ise adhik laabh pahunchaaya he or lok-prashasan ke kshitij kaa vistaar kiya he
 The new public administration has emphasized on this important thing that public administration should be directly connected to the society
 naveen lok-prashasan vishuddh rup se ek america dharna he
 In a country like India, the notion of new public publication or spread of ideas has not been widely spread
 tunded laga maason, paudi tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he

 His idea was that the sharing of power between the executive and the administration could not reconcile the governance

 When he became President, he undoubtedly implemented his ideas and made it a powerful focal point of President's rule

 He believed that satvik works will always triumph and that the representatives of truth should not compromise with untruths, indiscretions and hypocrisy
 apane shasankaal ke aarmabhik varshon main hi usne sampoorn janata kaa dhyaan aakarshith kar liya
 He inspired a sense of dedication, sacrifice and morality throughout national life
 lekin swayan kii satviktaa evam uddeshyon ke prati usamen itnaa garv kar gaya ki vah sochane laga ki jo uskaa virodh karte the ve ishwar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 He lacked Lincoln's humility
 apane chunaav abhiyaan main usne purv ke anudaaravaadi vichaaron ko tyagkar pragativaad kaa naaraa diya tha

 vah adarshavaadi tha
 When he was elected President for the second time, he was deeply concerned that in view of the tense world situation, America could not be placed on the foot of neutrality
 wilson shaanti kaa samarthak tha
 He was well aware that the war of war would have a huge impact on the ideology, philosophy and literature of the Americans from the American state in the world war
 wilson ne america prastaavon ko shaanti ke liye prastut kiya jinhen europea shaktiyon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The US declared neutrality

 "america could not remain untouched by the Great War, yet in 1914 no American knew that they would have to engage in war
 jab germany kii you-boton ne aniyantrit yuddh shuru kar diya to germany ke viruddh antim shaktishaalee tatasth desh america bhi yuddh main pravisht ho gaya
 Wilson sent his famous message to the Congress on 2 April 1917, in which he advised his country to enter the war and protect the world democratic powers
 ukt sandesh main usne kaha, ”jin siddhanton ko ham hriday se chaahate hai, unki raksharth ham avashya ladege
 We will protect democracy

 Today is the fortunate day of America, when our citizens will spend their blood and their power to protect the principles on which America was born, on the basis of which America got happiness and prosperity and that priceless peace
 Which he has been observing in terms of great importance
 “ Peaceful Wilson was constrained

 a part of the speech of 17 January 1917 expresses his sensitive thoughts towards the whole of humanity - "peace without victory of any party, principle of self-judgment for each caste, collective, freedom, limitation of arms and weapons, engaging System of collective protection to eradicate treaties and prevent invasion

 At that time in Europe, there was a feeling that Wilson is the only person who has risen above the rage and hatred of various nations and is the protector of humanity
 atah jab yah darshanik raja apane siddhanton kii pustika haath main lekar sainik-shakti se las, sandhi kii sharten nirdhaarit karne aayaa to europe kii janata ne uske sammaan main hriday khol diya
 It received unprecedented reception in all countries

 wilson is sammelan main shaanti kaa deep banakar aayaa tha
 He did not want the Paris Conference to become a stronghold of vested interests like the Vienna Congress of 1815
 parantu vah andaaj nahin laga paaya tha ki vijeta rashtron main swaarth kii gandh rahati he or yadi vah anya tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhata to vah us jaal yaa dhokhe se batch jaataa jisamen vah swayan apane adarshavaad ke kaaran buree tarah ulajh gaya
 His sacred objectives were consumed in front of the conquering nations
 wilson ne apane vichaaron ko prasiddh 14 sutron ke rup main prastut kiya
 The first of its 14 sources was that peace agreements would be made publicly, there would be no secret agreement
 in siddhanton kii mitrarashtron ke raajnneetigyon ne bhi saraahna kii thi
 Apart from the above principles, what else did they have to solve post-war problems? And the defeated nations also agreed to these principles but nothing could be done in front of the ideals and principles in the power-loving nations
 is sammelan main bhi rashtravaadi vichaaron, vyaktigat swaarthon kaa bolbalaa rahaa, jinka vienna congress main praadhanya rahaa tha
 Both Clemensi of France and Lloyd of England succeeded in imposing their dogma on Wilson
 aar0bi0 mobaat ne ‘european diplomasi’ main likhaa he ki ”klemenso praatavkaal yah vaakya duharaaya karata tha- main rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa samarthan karuunga
 "but when Orlando of Italy was asked what is your opinion about the League of Nations, he replied that" We would undoubtedly welcome the establishment of the League of Nations, but the question of Fume should be fixed
 “ wilson sampoorn sammelan main akelaa pad gaya tha
 After the Vienna Congress, there was no such global conference in Europe on such a large scale
 princeton main raajnneeti-darshan kaa yah bhootpurv professor ek pratibhashali vaktaa tathaa adarshavaadi vichaarak tha
 He was a man of strong beliefs with a high degree of political foresight, but not so much diplomatic competence as to prepare other representatives for lenient dealings with defeated nations
 stennard baker ke shabdon main ”jis kisi ne bhi usko kaam karte dekha, uski kabhi himmat nahin hui ki vah wilson ke samaksh athwa uski peeth peeche ninda karne kaa saahas karata
 "wilson believed that mankind could be protected only by the establishment of the League of Nations, so he wanted to make it an indispensable part of all peace
 kintu vah maansik drushti se loyad jorge tathaa klemenso ke samaan kushagra nahin tha or apane purv-nirdhaarit vichaaron par vishesh rup se bharosa rakhata tha, atah vah kootneeti ke kshetra main or raajnneetik saudebaaji ke nausikhia siddh hua
 Other countries took full advantage of his idealism and excessive enthusiasm to establish a League of Nations
 anya desh rashtrasang ke nirmaan kii baat maan len, iske liye wilson sab kuch tyaagane ke liye taiyaar tha, yahaan tak ki rashtrasang ke liye vah apane 14 sutron ke anek siddhanton kii avhelnaa karne ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 According to Paul Birdsall's statement, he was successful in getting most of his sayings in the name of the League from Britain, France and Japan on all other questions besides the problem of compensation
 chini janata dwaara baas hua shantung kaa pradesh wilson ke aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth ke aadhaar par china ko milanaa chaiye tha, kintu wilson ne rashtrasang kii sthapana ke liye anya mahashaktiyon kaa sahyog praapt karne kii ichha se ise japan ko dene kaa nirnay kiya
 This decision was a rebuff by Wilson himself
 phir bhi, paris-sammelan main yadi parajiton ke saath thodi narmi barti gai to vah wilson ke kaaran hi
 There was no doubt that if Wilson had not been at the conference, Lloyd George and Clemenso would have known what to do
 wilson hi unki aseem aakankshaon par ankush lagaataa rahaa
 If Wilson had not been there, France would have died by erasing Germany's nomination
 wilson ke do uddeshy the
 First just agreement according to which the boundaries of nations are determined on the principle of self-decision so that mutual peace can be established
 dwitiya, rashtrasang kii sthapana
 In the first objective, he did not succeed because the peace that was done was imposing peace and not on the basis of self-judgment or peace of negotiation
 parantu use duusare uddeshy main safalataa praapt hui
 The idea of a League of Nations was not original and many people contributed to clarify this idea in many countries, but the League of Nations that was finally founded was Wilson's creation and the temple of his ideals
 kuch vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki wilson ne swayan paris main aakar ek baari bhul kii
 If he had stayed in Washington and ordered the American delegates, it would have been more likely that his influence would have been more widespread, but Wilson was most concerned with the League of Nations and his desire was to make the legislation of the world institution his own
 vastav main yah bahut durbhagyapurna rahaa ki jahaan sammelan main uski upasthiti swayan sammelan ke liye hitkar na rahi, vahaan apane desh se dur hokar vah america janata se bhi sampark sthapit na rakh sakaa jiskaa dushprinaam yah hua ki uske dwaara poshit rashtrasang ko uske swayan ke desh ne hi asweekaar kar diya
 The US Senate did not accept Wilson's offer of membership of the League of Nations

 It was a sad defeat of a great prophet of humanity
 woodro wilson kaa maananaa tha ki lok prashasan ko raajnneeti se pruthak hona chahie
 He is generally remembered for underlining divisions in administration and politics
 wilson ke anusaar kisi samvidhan kii rachana to aasaan he kintu usko kriyanvit karnaa kathin he
 He laid special emphasis on the study of the field of implementation
 apane nibandh study of administration main wilson ne raajnneeti or prashasan ke antarasambandhon par charchaa karte hue likhaa tha ki, prashasan raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ke baahar he
 Administrative problems are not political problems
 yadhyapi raajnneeti, prashasan ke kaary va swaroop nirdhaarit kar sakati he phir bhi usko yah adhikaar nahin diya janaa chahie ki vah prashasnic pakshon ke bare main her-pher kar sake
 Woodrow Wilson was instrumental in establishing the administration as a subject, making the administration independent of politics

 Life of Religion and Culture- Vanaprastha Sanskar is the soul of Indian religion and culture
 jivan ko thik tarah jeene kii samasya usee se hal ho jaati he
 The rituals of youth are suppressed and repented by this practice
 jis desh, dharm jati tathaa samaaj main utpann hue hai, unki seva karne kaa, rin mukt hone kaa avasar bhi isi sthiti main miltaa he
 Therefore, the male and female, whose condition is suitable for this, should take Vanaprastha
 ek pratigya bandhan main bandh jane par vyakti apane jeevankram ko tadnurup dhaalane main adhik safal hota he, bina sanskaar karaaye manobhumi par waisi chhap gaharaai tak nahin padati
 Therefore, the steps are sometimes moving forward, sometimes moving backward
 vivaah na hone tak premi kaa sahcharatv sandigdh rahata he, par jab vivaah ho gaya ho, to sab kuch sthaayee evam suniyojit ho jaataa he
 Without the sacrament, the storm of charitable feelings can sometimes be relaxed or even ended, but if duly cremated, both the impulse and the local people will continue to motivate them to adopt the prescribed activity, so those who have the convenience according to the scriptures, they will be duly cremated
 Get it done

 The foundation of the Umairids Empire was established by Prince Babur of the Timurid dynasty around the early 1500s, when he captured Doab and controlled the fertile region of Sindh and the lower valley of the Indus River by the eastern region of Khorasan
 1526 main, babar ne dilli ke sultaanon main aakhri sultan, ibrahim shah lodi, ko panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya

 maheshwar sutara ko sanskrit vyakaran kaa aadhaar mana jaataa he
 In order to refine and regularize the present form of Sanskrit language, Panini incorporated various components and components of the language such as phonetics, name, designation, verb, prefix, prefix, sentence, gender, etc
 and their interrelations in the Ashtadhyayi
 is
 ashtaadhi main 32 paad hai jo aath adhyyon me samaan rup se vibhakt hai In this important book of grammar, Panini has given a comprehensive and thorough discussion of the huge collection of the divisive-dominated Sanskrit language in about 4000 sutras, which are divided into eight chapters
 tatkaaleen samaaj me lekhan saamagree kii dushprapyata ko dhyaan main rakhte hue panini ne vyakaran ko smritigamya banane ke liye sutara style kii sahaayta lee he
 Again, Panini has used many tools from his predecessor grammar as well as himself, to make the discussion very brief, of which the Shivasutra or Maheshwar Sutras are the most important
 maheshwar sutron kii utpatti bhagwaan nataraj ke dwaara kiye gayi tandav nrity se maani gayi he
 That is to say, "on the expiration of the dance, Nataraj played the damper nine times for the attainment and fulfillment of the wishes of the Sanakadi sages
 is prakaar chaudaa shivasutron kaa ye jaal prakat huyi
 " damru ke chaudaa baar bajaane se chaudaa sutron ke rup main dhvaniyaan nikali, inhen dhvaniyon se vyakaran kaa prakaatya hua
 That is why Lord Nataraja, the originator of grammar formulas, is considered
 prasiddhi he ki maharishi panini ne in sutron ko devadhidev shiv ke aashirwad se praapt kiya jo ki panineey sanskrit vyakaran kaa aadhaar bana
 The total number of Maheshwar Sutras is 14 which are as follows: 1

 Light uparyuktt 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke varnon ko ek vishisht prakaar se sanyojit kiya gaya he
 As a result, whenever Pāिini needs to use any particular group of characters in the interpretation of words or rules, they take those letters from the Maheshwar Sutras in an abbreviated form
 maheshwar sutron ko isi kaaran ‘pratyaahaar vidhayak’ sutara bhi kehete hai
 His method of making pratihar and his multiple uses in Sanskrit grammar is further shown
 in 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke samast varnon ko samavesh kiya gaya he
 In the first 4 sutras, vowel characters and remaining 10 sutra consonant characters are counted
 sankshep main swar varnon ko ach evam vyanjan varnon ko hal kaha jaataa he
 Good and light are also pratyahar
 pratyaahaar kaa arth hota he – sankshipt kathan
 Panini has instructed the method of making pratyahara by the 'adirantyen Saheta' sutra, the 71st formula of the first foot of the first chapter of Ashtadhyayi
 adirantyen saheta : aadi varna antim it varna ke saath milakar pratyaahaar banaata he jo aadi varna evam itsanjyak antim varna ke purv aae hue varnon kaa samshti rup main bodh karaata he
 Example: Ach = Aa Pratihar is made by using the initial letter 'A' of the first Maheshwar Sutra 'aiun' with the last letter 'A' of the fourth sutra 'aiuch'
 yah ach pratyaahaar apane aadi akshar ‘a’ se lekar itsanjyak ch ke purv aane vaale ou paryant sabhi aksharon kaa bodh karaata he
 Hence, ach = a i u ri e i o ou
 Similarly, the attainment of light pratyahar is achieved by mixing the initial letter of the 5th sutra hayavart with the last letter of the 14th sutra hal
 faltah, In all the above 14 sutras, Panini has given the last letter as it
 it sangya hone se in antim varnon kaa upyog pratyaahaar banane ke liye keval anubandh hetu kiya jaataa he, lekin vyakaraniya prakriya me inaki gananaa nahi kii jaati he arthath inkaa prayog nahi hota he

 sankhyikeey yantriki main kanon ke vishisht varnan ko kan sankhyikee kehete hai
 Three types of statistics are mainly used in physics
 chirsammat sankhyikee, bose-oinstin or fermi-dirack sankhyikee
 Current Statistics, bose-oinstin or fermi-dirack sankhyikee prakaar ko sammilit rup main kwantum sankhyikee bhi kehete hai, kyonki inamen ham kwantum siddhant ke ddhara jatil samudaayon ke gundharmo kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Prior to the invention of quantum statistics, this work was taken from the statistic itself and it also got enough success
 parantu kalantar main prakaash-vidyut prabhaav nune taap par vishesh ooshmaa, kaali vastu kaa vikiran vishyak kuch aise avishkaar hue jinako chirsantam bhautikee bhalee prakaar se samajha nahi saki
 Thus quantum theory was born
 kwantum sankhyikee kaa avishkaar bharat ke suprasiddh vaigyanik es

 bose ne san 1924 main kiya jab unhone pehali baar plank kaa vikiran niyam sankhyikee dhang se nikaala
 Einstein originally propagated the principle called bose-einstein Statistics by spreading this rule to the gaseous community
 fermi or dirack ne san 1924 main swatantra rup se fermi -dirack sankhyikee kii neenv, daali, jo pauli ke apvarjan siddhant par aadhaarit thi
 In a community of similar particles it is in principle impossible to differentiate between particles, so the wavelength of the community must be symmetric or asymmetric in the coordinates of any two particles
 isse vinimay kriya jaise bahut se prabhaav hote hai, jo katipay dhaatuon main louh chumbakatch tathaa pratilohachubakatv ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Different particles can be divided into two categories so that the community of similar particles of one type will be according to the bose-einstein-statistic and the behavior of similar particles of the other type will be based on the fermi-dirac-statistic
 ve sab parmanviya nabhik jinaki sanhatisankhya yugma hoti he, bose-oinstin-sankhyikee main sammilit hai ke-mesaan ) aadi, tathaa jinaki sanhatisankhya visham hoti he, ve sab fermi-dirack-sankhyikee ke anusaar vyavhaar karte he 
 The fermi-dirac, bose-einstein and Maxwell statistics have the same behavior in the marginal condition
 akriy samaan kanon ke samudaay ke gun adarsh gas ke gunon se kitne bhinn hote hai, We get this estimate from p = nh3 / g
 is sutara main m kan kii sanhati, n ek ghan sam main kanon kii sankhya, h plank niyatank, k boltzman niyatank, t samudaay param taap or g ko ham bhargunak kehete hai jiskaa mulya electron ke liye do or mesaan ke liye teen he
 If the value of p is less than one, the behavior of the gas is similar to that of an ideal gas
 bose gas ke liye p kaa adhiktam maan 2
612 he or aisa gas ko purnataya apkrisht kaha jaataa he
 It is related to the bose-isteine condensation process, which occurs at 2

 is param taap se nimna taap par is drav ke kuch gun bade adbhut he, jaise atitaralata 
 He3, which complies with the fermi-dirac-statistic, remains a fluid up to zero ultimate temperature, like He4, and does not make up to 0
08 absolute temperature
 in do dravon ko kwantum drav kehete he
 In the fermi-dirac statistic, when p is much larger than one, the gas is said to be completely unrefined
 dhaatuon main chaalan electron apkrisht gas banaata he
 The electrical and thermal properties of metals can be explained well by this method
 upar likhen sutara se yah spasht he ki koi gas saadhaaran taap par mexwal sankhyikee ke anusaar vyavhaar karti he, parantu jyon-jyon uskaa taap kam hota jaataa he or uskaa daab badhati jaati he, p kaa mulya badhata jaataa he or gas kwantum ho jaataa he
 The density of a particular class of stars, called white dwarf stars, is very high
 aise taron ke dravya kaa vyavhaar purnataya fermi-dirack-sankhyikee ke anusaar he
 Previously Bose and Fermi statistics were used only to study the properties of gases whose particles have no attractive power and whose particle has zero value
 parantu baad main kwantum sankhyikee kii sahaayta se un gaison kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jane laga jinke kanon main kuch aakarshan shakti hoti he or jinke kan kathor gole kii bhanti he
 Today, we have more knowledge than ever about the properties of metals at low temperatures by quantum statistics; For example, concerning superconductivity
