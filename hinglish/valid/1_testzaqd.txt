 Yashpal's name is prominent among the writers of modern Hindi literature
 ye ek saath hi krantikari evam lekhak donon roopon main jane jate he
 After Premchand, he is named among the well-known progressive storytellers of Hindi
 apane vidhyaarthee jivan se hi yashpal krantikari aandolan se jude, iske parinamswarup lambi faraari or jail main vyateet karnaa padaa
 After this, he made literature his life, the work which he had done through gun, now he started the work of public awareness through bulletin
 yashpal ko sahitya evam shiksha ke kshetra main bharat sarkaar dwaara san 1970 main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Yashpal was born in an ordinary Khatri family on 3 December 1903 in Ferozepur Cantonment, Punjab
 unki maan shrimati premdevi vahaan anathalay ke ek skool main adhyapika thim
 Yashpal's father Harilal was an ordinary businessman
 unka paitruk gaanv ranghad tha, jahaan kabhi unke purvaj hamirpur se aakar bas gaye the
 Father had a small shop and it was because of his business that people used to call him 'lala'
 bich-bich main ve ghode par saamaan ladakar pheri ke liye aas-paas ke gaanvon main bhi jate the
 He used to raise a small amount of money he had collected from his business, without any strong written and educated hand, borrowed on interest
 apane parivaar ke prati unka dhyaan nahin tha
 That is why Yashpal's mother, with her two sons - Yashpal and Dharmapala - was much more aware of her children's education while teaching in a school of Arya Samaj in Ferozepur Cantonment
 yashpal ke vikaas main garibi ke prati tikhi ghrinaa arya samaaj or swadhinata andolan ke prati upje aakarshan ke mul main unki maan or is parivesh kii ek nirnaayak bhoomika rahi he
 Poverty suffered in Yashpal's creative development had a distinctive role in his childhood
 apane bachapan main yashpal ne angrezon ke aatank or vicitra vyavhaar kii anek kahaniyaan suni thim
 No Indian could pass an umbrella in front of the British to avoid rain or sunlight
 bade shaharon or pahaado par mukhya sadaken unheen ke liye thim, hindustani in sadakon ke neeche bani kachi sadak par chalate the
 Yashpal heard these things only in his senses, not seen, because by then the sparks of the revolutionary movement, which had denied the sovereignty of the British, were bursting in place
 lekin phir bhi apane bachapan main yashpal ne jo bhi kuch dekha, vah angrezon ke prati ghrinaa bhar dene ko kaafii tha
 He writes, "I have seen the British taking salute from all the common people on the road
 hindustaniyon ko unke saamne gidgidaate dekha he, isse apana apmaan anumaan kiya he or uske prati virodh anubhav kiya
 

 ' angrezon or prakarantar se british samrajyavad ke viruddh apni ghrinaa ke sandarbh main yashpal apane bachapan kii do ghatnaon kaa ullekh vishesh rup se karte hai
 The first of these incidents is of four-five years of age
 tab unke ek sambandhi yuktpraant ke kisi qasbe main kapaas otane ke kaarakaane main manager the
 There were two to four bungalows of the British working near the factory station
 aas-paas hi in logon kaa khub aatank tha
 Chickens were raised in one of these bungalows, which roamed on the nearby road
 ek shaam yashpal un murgiyon se chhedhkhani karne lage
 Mem Sahiba, who lives in Bengali, reprimanded children for this act
 shaayad ‘gadhaa’ yaa ‘ullu’ jaisi koi gaali bhi di
 Yashpal, a child of four or five years, also responded to his abuses with abuse
 jab us stri ne unhen maarane kii dhamkee di, to unhone bhi use vaise hi dhamkaate hue jawaab diya or phir bhagkar kaarakaane main chhip gaye
 But the incident could not be taken lightly
 isaki shikaayat unke sambandhi se kii gai
 He complained to Yashpal's mother, and amidst many apprehension and terror, he also told about the crisis that could befall the people of the whole factory
 phir iske parinaam kaa ullekh karte hue yashpal likhte hai, ‘meri maan ne ek chadi lekar mujhe koob peeta main zamin par lot-pot gaya parantu pitayee jari rahi
 It is not difficult to imagine how my feelings towards the British must have arisen as a result of this incident
 


’ The second incident is a little later
 tab yashpal kii maan yuktpraant main hi nainital zile main tirai ke qasbe kashipur main arya kanya paathshaala main mukhyadhyapika thim
 Relatively far away from the city, the relative had got a lot of accommodation due to his work and Yashpal's mother also lived there
 ghar ke paas hi ‘dron sagar’ naamak ek talab tha
 The women of the house often went for a walk there in the afternoon
 ek din ve striyaan vahaan naha rahi thim ki uske duusari ore do angrez shaayad faujee gore, achaanak dikhaai die
 Seeing them, women started screaming in fear and clinging to each other in self-defense, in fear, they took off their clothes and started running away
 yashpal bhi unke saath bhaage
 Nothing special happened but the scene of running away from the British in such a manner was permanently stung in their memory
 

‘angrez se vah bhay aisa hi tha jaise bakriyon ke jhund ko baagh dekh lene se bhay lagata hoga arthath angrez kuch bhi kar saktaa tha
 There was no other way than to cry and scream with fear from him
 

’ The Arya Samaj and the Congress were the stops which Yashpal eventually came to the revolutionary organization
 unki maan unhen swami dayanand ke aadarshon kaa ek tejasvi prachaarak bananaa chaahati thim
 For this purpose, he got his initial education in Gurukul Kangri
 arya samaji daman ke viruddh ugr pratikriya ke beej unke man kii dharti par yaheen pade
 It was here that he got an opportunity to closely observe the revivalist tendencies
 apni nirdhantaa kaa kachot-bharaa anubhav bhi unhen yaheen hua
 Even in his childhood, he does not think of himself as responsible for the crime of being poor
 inhen sanskaron ke kaaran ve garib ke apmaan ke prati kabhi udasin nahin ho sake
 Congress was Yashpal's second stage
 apane daur ke anek duusare logon kii tarah ve bhi congress ke madhyam se hi raajnneeti main aae
 From the political point of view Firozpur Cantt was a peaceful place
 chhavnee se teen mile dur shahar ke lacture or jalse hote rahete the
 Even khadi used to be propagated
 1921 main, asahyog andolan ke samay yashpal atharah varsh ke navayuvak the—desh-seva or rashtrabhakti ke utsaah se bharpoor, videshi kapadon kii holi ke saath ve congress ke prachaar-abhiyaan main bhi bhaag lete the
 Khaddar kurta-pajama and Gandhi used to wear hats made from household slugs
 isi khaddar kaa ek kot bhi unhone banwaaya tha
 Tired of getting muddy again and again, they had him red colored
 is kaal main apane bhaashanon main, british samrajyavad virdohi aankadon ke strot ke rup main, ve desh-darshan naamak jis pustak kaa ullekh karte hai vah sambhawatah 1904 main prakashit sakhaaraam ganesh deuskar kii bangla pustak desherkatha he, bhartiya jan-maanas par jisaki chhap vyapak pratikriya or lokapriyata ke kaaran british sarkaar ne jis par pabandi laga di thi
 The cause of Yashpal's immediate disenchantment with Mahatma Gandhi and Gandhism may have been announced on 12 February 22, after the chaura-chauri scandal by Mahatma Gandhi, but it had begun earlier
 yashpal or unke krantikari saathiyon kaa sashastr kranti kaa jo agenda tha, gandhi kaa ahimsa kaa siddhant uske virodh main jaataa tha
 He found the mixing of religion and politics by Mahatma Gandhi to be fundamentally wrong
 metric ke baad lahore aane par yashpal neshnal college main bhagatsingh, sukhdev or bhagwaticharan bohara ke sampark main aae
 His extensive and active participation in the activities of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha was in fact an inevitable result of his disenchantment with Gandhi and Gandhism
 noujvaan bharat sabha ke mukhya sutradhaar bhagwaticharan or bhagat singh the
 While commenting on the possible goals, Yashpal writes, 'the program of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha is to inspire the public by criticizing the compromise policy of the Gandhian Congress and to point out a fundamental difference between the revolutionaries and Mahatma Gandhi and the Gandhians in the masses
 Will be useful lala lajpatraay kii hinduvadi nitiyon se ghor virodh ke baavjood unpar hue lathi charge ke kaaran, jisase hi antat unki mrityu hui, bhagatsingh or unke saathiyon ne sanders kii hatya kii
 He saw this incident as a national insult whose resistance needed to be forgotten
 bhagatsingh dwaara asembli main bam-cond isi soch kii ek taarkik parinti thi, lekin bhagatsingh, sukhdev or raajaguru kii phaansi ke virodh main mahatma gandhi ne janata kii ore se vyapak dabaav ke baavjood, koi aupchaarik apil tak jari nahin kii
 In the memoirs of his revolutionary life, which Yashpal wrote in an overview, he evaluated that movement and his colleagues in his vision
 taarkikta, vaastaviktaa or vishwasaneeyata par unhone hameshaa jor diya he
 It is possible that many may disagree with that assessment or Yashpal is accused of distorting the facts
 aaj bhi kuch log aise hai, jo yashpal ko bahut acha krantikari nahin maanate
 In the context of his revolutionary life, he carries the character of his characterization as completely true and perhaps that is why he considers my constant and frequent return to Yashpal as something like a 'sand idol'
 ‘kranti’ ko bhi ve bam-pistaulavaali raajnneeti kranti tak hi simit karke dekhte hai
 The political revolution was a part of the revolutionary change in the social system for Yashpal
 samrajyavad ko ve ek shoshankari vyavastha ke rup main dekhte the, jo bhagatsingh ke shabdon main, ‘manushya ke haathon manushya ke or raashtra ke haathon raashtra ke shoshan kaa charam rup he’

 jagmohan or chamanlal, sanskaran ’19, pri
321) is vyavastha ke aadhaar stambh-jagiradaari or zameendaari vyavastha bhi usee tarah unke virodh ke mukhya agenda ke antargat aate the
 In the form of independence in the country and like many, they too were not satisfied
 swadhinata se adhik ve ise satta kaa hastantaran maanate the
 And it was almost like Premchand had once expressed his apprehension as sitting on the throne to Govind instead of John
 krantikari rashtra bhakthi or balidaan kii bhaavana se prerit-sanchalit yuvak the
 He always attested this by sacrificing the occasion
 lekin yashpal apane saathiyon ko irshyaa-dwesh, spardhaa-aakankshawale saadhaaran manushyon ke rup main dekhe jane par bal dete hai
 In his memoirs, Rajendra Yadav today declares the ideal - 'he is not a deity' - he begins in Hindi with exactly these memoirs of Yashpal
 ye krantikari saamaanya manushyon se kuch alag, visisth or apane lakshyon ke liye ekantik rup se samarpit hone par bhi saamaanya maanviya anubhutiyon se achoote nahin the
 Could have happened
 sharathchandra ne patheradavi main krantikariyon kaa jo adarsh rup prastut kiya, yashpal use avastavik maanate the, jisase rashtrabhakti kii prerana milti ho, use krantikari andolan or us jivan ko vaastaviktaa kaa ek pratinidhi or pramanik chitra nahin mana ja saktaa
 Subodhchandra Sen sees the disintegration of Savyasachi as a metaphor for the exodus of future magnate Subhash Chandra Bose on the electric storm waterfall night at Gupta Pathredawi, while Yashpal sees the real life of Sabyasachi's superhuman activities and life spent in lair-ruins And not considered authentic
 krantikari jivan ke apane lambey anubhavon ko hi ve apni is aalochana ke mukhya aadhaar ke rup main istemaal karte hai
 2, after his release from prison on March 38, when Yashpal started publishing and editing Viplav in November the same year, he defined his work as 'bullet Bulletin'
 jis ahimsak or samtamulak samaaj kaa nirmaan ve raajnneetik krantikari ke madhyam se karnaa chaahate the, usee adhure kaam ko aage badhaane ke liye unhone lekhan ko apana aadhaar banaaya
 Literature written at the center of the socio-political problems of its time is often always called as ideological
 nand dulaare vaajapeyi kaa premchand ke viruddh bada aarope yahi tha
 Yashpal answered almost the same as Premchand to the charge of propaganda
 apane pehle upanyaas dada commered kii bhoomika main unhone likhaa, ‘kala ke premiyon ko ek shikaayat mere prati he ki kala ko gaun or prachaar ko pramukh sthaan detaa hoon
 i do not have to appeal against this decision given to me
 santosh he apana abhipraay spasht kar paata hum


 apane lekhkeey sarokaaron par or vistaar se tippanee karte hue baad main unhone likhaa, ‘manushya ke purna vikaas or mukti ke liye sangharsh karnaa hi lekhak kii sarthakata he
 When the author shows contradiction in the old system and ideas for the liberation of man through his art and puts forth new ideals, then he is accused of being idealless and materialistic
 aaj ke lekhak kii jaden vaastaviktaa main hai, isliye vah bhautikwaadi to he hi parantu vah adarshaheen bhi nahin he
 His inspiration is more real
 aaj kaa lekhak jab apni kala dwaara nae aadarshon kaa samarthan karata he to us par prachaarak hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya jaataa he
 The writer always creates sympathy or opposition to an idea or ideal through his art
 sahitya vichaarpurn hoga
 The major genre of Yashpal's writing is novel, but he started his writing with stories
 unki kahaniyaan apane samay kii raajnneeti se us rup main aakraant nahin hai, jaise unke upanyaas
 In the era of the new story, against the artificial division of the body and mind of the woman, the image of an entire woman, which was emphasized, begins with Yashpal
 aaj kii kahani ke soch kii jo disha he, usamen yashpal kii kitni hi kahaniyaan bataur khaad istemaal hui he
 Their significance is unambiguous in terms of the possibilities of the present and the future story-scenario
 unke kahani-sangrahon main pinjre kii udaan, gyandaan, bhasmavrutt chinagaari, phulon kaa kurta, dharmayuddh, tumne kyon kaha tha main sundar hoon or uttami kii maan pramukh hai
 The map of what Yashpal had come from active politics to literature to create a world was very clear from the beginning
 unhone kisi yutapia kii jagah vyavastha kii vaastavik uplabdhiyon ko hi apana aadhaar banaaya tha
 In Yashpal's ideological journey, this sutra appears active from beginning to end, that the broad cooperation and active participation of the people are the main factors in the formation and development of a nation
 yashpal har jagah janata ke vyapak hiton ke samarthak or sangrakshak lekhak hai
 When Yashpal defines his journalism and writing as 'bulletin instead of bullet', in a way, he is commenting on his creative concerns
 aise durdharsh lekhak ke pratinidhi rachanakarm kaa yah sanchayan use sampoornataa main jaanane-samajhane ke liye prerit karegaa, aisa hamaara vishwaas he

 He got married to Iravati, the daughter of Uttar Naresh and four sons were born to that noble wife
 acharya krip ko guru bana kar unhone jahnavi ke tat par teen ashwamegh yajna kiye
 In those sacrifices, eternal money was donated to Brahmins and they left for Digvijay
 unheen dinon dharm ne bail kaa rup bana kar gaurupini prithvi se saraswati tat par bhent kiya
 Gaurupini was tearing through the eyes of the earth and it seemed to be Shrihin
 dharm ne prithvi se poocha - "he devi! tumhaara mukh malin kyon ho rahaa he? kis baat kii tumhen chintaa he? kahin tum meri chintaa to nahin kar rahi ho ki ab meraa keval ek pair hi rah gaya he yaa phir tumhen is baat kii chintaa he ki ab tum par shudra rajya karenge?" Prithvi said - "O religion! You, despite being omniscient, ask me the reason for my grief! Truth, purity, forgiveness, mercy, contentment, renunciation, sham, dum, tenacity, simplicity, ability, scriptural consideration, overhead, learning, knowledge Contains qualities like quietness, valor, sharpness, opulence, force, memory, talent, skill, freedom, boldness, tenderness, patience, courage, modesty, humility, good luck, enthusiasm, seriousness, fame, faithfulness, stability, pride, egolessness etc

 Among the feet of Lord Krishna, which Lakshmi ji serves, are the symbols of lotus, vajra, ankush, flag etc
 and those steps used to fall on me, which i was fortunate to have
 ab meraa saubhaahgya samaapt ho gaya he
 " jab dharm or prithvi ye baaten kar hi rahe the ki mukutadhaari shudra ke rup main kaliyug vahaan aayaa or un donon ko maarane laga
 King Parikshit was passing by while doing Digvijay
 unhone mukutadhaari shudra ko haath main danda liye ek gaay or ek bail ko buree tarah peetate dekha
 The bull was very beautiful, it was white and had only one leg
 gaay bhi kamdhenu ke samaan sundar thi
 Both were shivering in fear
 maharaj parakshit apane dhanushwan ko chadhaakar megh ke samaan gambheer vaani main lalakaare - "re dusht! paapi! naradham! tu koun he? in nirih gaay tathaa bail kyon sata rahaa he? tu mahaan apradhi he
 The only punishment for your crime is your slaughter
 " unke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug bhay se kaanpane laga
 The Maharaj asked the bull that, o ox, your three legs are broken
 tum bail ho yaa koi devtaa ho
 Hey Dhenuputra! You tell me your own account fearlessly
 he gaumata! ab tum bhaymukt ho jaao
 i punish the wicked
 kis dusht ne mere rajya main ghor paap kar ke pandavon kii pavitra kirti main yah kalank lagaaya he? chaahe vah paapi saakshaat devtaa hi kyon na ho main uske bhi haath kaat doongaa
 Then Dharma said - "O Maharaj! You are born in the clan of the Pandavas, the supreme devotees of Lord Krishna, so these words are worthy of you
 he rajan! ham yah nahin jaanate ki sansar ke jeevon ko koun klesh detaa he
 It has been described in many ways in the scriptures as well
 jo dwait ko nahin maanata vah dukh kaa kaaran apane aap ko hi sweekaar karata hai
 One considers destiny as the cause of sorrow and one considers karma as the cause of sorrow
 katipay vidwaan swabhaav ko or katipay ishwar ko bhi dukh kaa kaaran maanate hai
 So, o Rajan! Now you decide who is the cause of the misery
 " On hearing the words of the bull, the Emperor Parikshit said - "O Taurus! You are definitely a religion in the form of a bull and this cow god is Prithvi Mata
 aap dharm ke marm ko bhalee-bhanti jaanate hai
 You can not cheat anyone, that is why you are not giving the name of the person who is suffering
 he dharm! satyuga main aapke tap, pavitrataa, dayaa or satya chaar charan the
 Three stages remain in the Treta, only two remain in the copper age, and now due to this evil Kali Yuga, only one stage is left for you
 yah adharmarupi kaliyug apane asaty se us charan ko bhi nasht karne kaa praytn kar rahaa he
 The evil sinful Shudra kings will enjoy this beautiful land due to Lord Srikrishna Chandra's own movement, that is why this mother is also sad
 " Saying so, King Parikshit took out his sharp-edged sword to kill that sinful Shudra royalty Kali Yuga
 kaliyug ne bhaybheet hokar apane rajasi vesh ko utaar kar raja parakshit ke charnon main gir gaya or traahi-traahi kehane laga
 King Parikshit was a great refugee Vatsal, he did not think it appropriate to kill the Kaliyuga who came in the shelter and said to the Kaliyuga - "O Kaliyuga! You have come to my shelter, so i gave you my life
 kintu adharm, paap, jhooth, chori, kapat, daridrata aadi anek updravon kaa mul kaaran keval tu hi he
 Therefore, leave my kingdom immediately and do not come back again
 " Hearing these words of King Parikshit, Kali Yuga said in a Katar voice - "O Rajan! Your kingdom is on the whole earth, there is no place outside my kingdom where i can reside
 he bhupati! aap bade dayaalu hai, aapane mujhe sharan diya he
 Now you have to manage some kind of my residence with mercy
 " When Kali Yuga said this, King Parikshit got into thinking
 phir vichaar kar ke unhone kaha - "he kaliyug! dyut, madhpan, parastrigaman or hinsa in chaar sthanon main asaty, mad, kaam or krodh kaa nivas hota he
 i allow you to live in these four places
 " is par kaliyug bolaa - "he uttaranandan! ye chaar sthaan mere nivas ke liye aparyaapt hai
 Please give me some other place of mercy
 " kaliyug ke is prakaar maangane par raja parakshit ne use paanchava sthaan 'swarna' diya
 Kali Yuga went away from there after meeting these places, but after going some distance, he came back in an invisible form and resided in the golden crown of King Parikshit
 iske baad parikshit shikaar ke liye bahut bhatke or bhukh or pyaas ke maare unka bura haal tha 
 Losing weary in the evening, he reached the ashram of Shamik Rishi and at that time the sage was absorbed in the Brahmin Samaghi
 
 Parikshit said that we are thirsty we need water, there is no one here, are you listening, we are talking about the king, we are thirsty, we need water, you do not hear whether the sage was a Brahmin in the tomb at that time
 - Three times asked for water but the sage's house was not broken
 
 Kaliyuga sitting in Rajmukut got inspired by his true wisdom and decided to punish the sage
 parantu raja ke achche sanskaro ke kaaran unhonen apane-aap ko us paap se roak liya 
 In a fit of rage, he put the dead snake around the sage

 The second sage Kumaro went and narrated the whole ritual

 saanchaa:copied to Wikibooks Dog training is the process of training a dog in which they are taught to take certain actions by reacting to certain commands, which the dog is trained to understand
 yah ek saamaanya shabd he jo apane aap main is baat kaa varnan nahin karata ki kute ko kya or kaise sikhaaya jaataa he
 Dog training has many methods and objectives, ranging from basic obedience training to specialized areas like law enforcement, military, search and rescue, hunting, working with livestock, helping people with disabilities, recreation, dog sports and people and Asset protection included
 jhund main rahane vaale pashu ke rup main, junglee kutton main prakritik sahaj gyaan hota he jo unke saathi kutton ke sahyog main madad karata he
 Many domestic dogs are so trained through instinct or breeding that they understand and respond to the signals given by the human controller properly
 adhikansh kute, chaahe unka antim unnat prashikshan yaa vaanchit uddeshy kuch bhi ho, un logon ke saath rahete hai jo chaahate hai ki ve is tareeke se vyavhaar karen ki unka aasapaas rahanaa unhen acha lage, unhen surakshit rakhen or anya logon or paaltu jaanwaron se unhen suraksha pradaan karen
 kute apane boote par buniyadi aagyaakaarita ko nahin samaj sakate hai; iske liye unhen prashikshit kiya janaa chahie
 The most difficult part of training is to interact with the dog in a human way that the dog can understand
 However, the principle implicit in this type of communication is very simple: it can be easily done by rewarding for the desired behavior and ignoring or modifying the unwanted behavior
 mul paaltu aagyaakaarita prashikshan main aamtaur par chah vyavhaar shaamil hote hai: "reform" should never include harmful physical force or violence
 The use of force during training is controversial and should not be taken lightly, because even if it ends up in practice at the end, when it is applied incorrectly with some dogs, it causes drive damage, stress and It can even cause rage in some cases

 The prenatal period has recently been identified as the developmental period of the puppies
 yah sochaa jaataa he ki "kuch stanadhariyon main garbh main hone vaali ghatnaon ke dwaara vyavhaaraatmak vikaas par dirghakaalik prabhaav utpann kiye ja sakate hai"
pichley adhyayanon main is avadhi ke astitv kii andekhi kii gayi, chunki pille ke vyavhaar kaa prekshan nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 With the development of the ultrasound machine, now a puppy can be observed even when the mother is in the fourth week of pregnancy
 yah paaya gaya ki bhrun sparsh ke liye or / yaa maa ke pet ke baahar se die jane dabaav ke liye pratikriya karte hai
 In addition, it has been theorized that since puppies have a well-developed tactile sense at birth, tactile sensations must have developed well before birth
 Studies found that "when a pregnant animal is affectionately cherished, its baby is such that it can be easily controlled by love", according to Fox, this allows them to develop a sense of comfort, emotional attachment and socialization
 it happens
 anya adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki jo pille garbh ke dauraan bahari sanket praapt karte hai unamem aise pillon kii tulana main sparsh ke liye adhik sahansheeltaa hoti he, jinhone is prakaar ke sanket praapt nahin kiye the
 It can be said in principle in such a way that lovingly loving mother's stomach promotes positive, beneficial socialization with people in puppies
 pille ke jivan ke pehle do hafton ke dauraan, jise neonetal avadhi ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, pille saadhaaran samuhik gatividhiyon ko sikh sakate hai
 However, the events of the initial experience are unlikely to go into the later period
 adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki neonetal avadhi main anubhav ke dwaara kuch nahin siikhaa jaataa he
 It has been theorized that this is due to the fact that the puppy's brain, sensory and motive organs have not yet developed
 isaki samvednaa or seekhney kii simit kshamta ke aadhaar par ek pille ke manovigyaan ko, sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak arth main prabhavit karnaa mushkil hoga
 The next period of development is known as the socialization period
 yah avadhi 3 saptaah kii aayu ke aasapaas shuru hoti he or lagbhag 12 saptaah kii aayu ke aas paas khatm hoti he
 The main aspect of this period is social sports
 saamaajik khoj, chanchaltapurna ladaai or khel yukt yon vyavhaar, iske jivan ke dauraan saamaajik sambandhon ke vikaas ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he
 Puppies' interaction with their mothers and with other puppies has a direct impact on new patterns of behavior
 is avadhi ke dauraan pille, anya pillon ke saath or logon ke saath saamaajik sambandhon kaa vikaas karte hai
 However, there is a point at which puppies may develop fear for strangers
 3 se 5 saptaah kii aayu main pille sakriy rup se ajanabiyon ko aakarshith karte hai
 Shortly thereafter, they start avoiding strangers and gradually the isolation increases when they reach the age of 12 to 14 weeks
 jahaan ek ore ajanabiyon ke liye yah prakritik dar jigyaasu pille ko hameshaa shikariyon se dur rakhata he, vahiin duusari ore yah logon ke saath saamaanya sambandhon main baadhak ban saktaa he
 During this period, there develops a frightening response to sudden sounds or movements
 isse pille ko khatarnaak or surakshit yaa tuchh ghatnaon ke bich kaa antar samajhane main madad milti he
 During the period of socialization, it develops an attachment to certain specific places
 yah tab dikhaai detaa he jab pille kii jagah badal dene par usamen bahut ashaanti yaa hadabdaahat paidaa ho jaati he
 This is known as localization

 Dogs that are human controlled and lovingly cherished during the first eight weeks of life can usually be easily trained and quickly prepared to live in human habitat
 adarsh rup main, pillon ko 8 se 10 saptaah kii aayu ke bich unke sthaayee gharon main rakhaa janaa chahie
 kuch sthanon main pillon ko 8 saptaah kii umr se pehle unki maa se dur le janaa kanoon ke khilaaf he
 Initially puppies are more afraid of new things during the 10 to 12 week period, so it is more difficult to adapt to a new home
 pille adeshon or gatividhiyon ko 8 saptaah kii aayu se siikhnaa shuru kar sakate hai; kshamta, ekaagratha or shaareerik samanvay isaki kuch simaaen hai

 Professional "dog trainers" train the dog to be its guardian
 sabase zyada prabhavi hone ke liye, abhibhavak ko kute ko sikhaai jane vaali takneekon kaa upyog karnaa chahie or un par jor dena chahie
 ve abhibhavak or kute jo ek saath aisi kakshaon main shaamil hote hai, ve ek duusare ke bare main zyada sikh pate hai, unhen yah jaanane kaa mauka miltaa he ki ek prashikshak ke maargdarshan main kaise ek saath kaam kiya jaye
 prashikshan tab zyada prabhavi hota he jab log prashikshan ke dauraan kute ko prashikshit karte hai, yah cmand, vidhiyon or pravartan ko sunishchit karata he
 These classes also help socialize dogs for other dogs and people
 prashikshan kakshaen kai kenles, pet stores or swatantra prashikshakon ke dwaara uplabdh karaayi jaati hai
 Group classes are not available until the puppy vaccination is completed at 3–4 months of age; However, some instructors offer puppy socialization classes in which puppies can be registered immediately after being placed in their permanent home, when the risk of disease is minimal and puppies have been given initial immunization
 In most cases, basic training classes only accept puppies who are at least 3 to 6 months of age, although you are advised to start training immediately as soon as the puppy arrives at your home
 Puppies can also be individually trained by trainers, after the age of 8 weeks, the trainer himself comes to the dog's house to train it
 ek pille ko anushaasan, nirantarata or apane maalik ke dhairya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Puppy training phase is very important to make a dog healthy and happy and at the same time it also makes the home environment safe and happy
 kutton abhivyaktipurna hote hai ve kaat kar, ugr hokar or baichaiyn hokar apni jaruraton ko bataa sakate hai
 Changing your behavior can be important in changing a puppy's behavior
 ghar prashikshan pillon ke liye ek mahatvapurn mudda he
 Different methods of home training work, although the key must be stable
 With regularly enforced rules, small box, crate, or paper training can be successful
 mudra kii madad se karavaaya gaya relexeshan ) ek niyantrak or pille ke bich sambandh sthapit karne kii ek prabhavi takanic ho sakati he
 The controller does not place the puppy below 4–6 months of age and holds the dog in such a position that only a minimum of sufficient force is applied to maintain its position
 Once the puppy ceases to struggle and relays, the controller rubs the puppy's neck and back
 mularoop se, kute kaa prashikshan sanchaar se sambandhit he
 From a human point of view, the controller talks to the dog and tells him which behaviors are right and desirable, or under which circumstances they should be preferred and which behaviors are not desirable
 ek niyantrak ko kute kii baat ko samajhnaa aana chahie
 kutta is baat kaa sanket de saktaa he kii vah anishchit he, uljhan main he, khush he, uttejit he yaa aisa hi kuch mahasoos kar rahaa he
 The dog's training should focus on its emotional state, as a dog who is stressed or distracted will not be able to learn effectively
 seekhney ke siddhant ke anusaar aise chaar mahatvapurn sandesh hai jo ek niyantrak kute ko de saktaa he
 Continuous use of words or signs for these messages quickly leads the dog to understand them
 yah dhyaan dena mahatvapurn he ki kute kaa puraskaar or puraskaar marker samaan nahin hai
 The prize marker is a sign that tells the dog that he has received the prize
 uski prashansa karnaa, uske saath khelnaa, yaa aisa kuch bhi puraskaar ho saktaa he jise kute ko puraskrit maltos or latcos sharkara ke hi prakaar hai, atev ye bhi shuddh carbohydrate hai
 Glycogen is diluted
 Not awarding after the prize marker kills the value of the prize marker and makes training more difficult
 in chaaron sanketon kaa arth kute ko punrariti ke madhyam se sikhaaya jaataa he, jisase vah clasical condishning ke saath ek sambandh bana letaa he or sajaa marker ko sajaa ke saath jod kar dekhne lagata he
 These messages can be stated verbally or as untold signals
 yantric clickers kaa upyog aksar ek puraskaar marker ke rup main kiya jaataa he, iske liye in shabdon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he "haa!" yaa "acha!"
 shabd "nahin" ek aam sazaa marker he
 "oh, is that so!" Is a common NRM
 ek ke ji es aamtaur par doharaaya jane vaala shabdaansh he Hand gestures and body language also play an important role in teaching dogs
 kuch sutron kaa tark he ki manushya kii aawaaj sabase prabhavi marker he
 Dogs cannot easily understand commands
 ek cmand jo ghar ke andar kaam kar saktaa he ho saktaa he vahi cmand ghar ke baahar yaa kisi bhinn sthiti main uske liye uljhan bharaa ho
har nayi sthiti main cmand ko phir se sikhaane kii zarurat hoti he
 This is sometimes called "cross-referencing", that is, a dog has to understand what he needs to learn for different contexts
 adhikansh prashikshan kutton ke vyavhaar ke liye parinaamon ko sthapit karne ke aas paas ghoomte hai
 Operant conditioning defines the following four types of outcomes
 adhikansh prashikshakon kaa daawa he ki ve "sakaaratmak prashikshan vidhiyon" kaa upyog karte hai
 Generally, this means using reward-based training to enhance good behavior rather than using corporal punishment to reduce bad behavior
 sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran aisa kuch bhi ho saktaa he jisase kutta puraskrit mahasoos kare- vishesh bhojan, ek tag khilone ke saath khilne kaa mauqaa, anya kutton ke saath saamaajik sampark, yaa uske maalik kaa uski ore dhyaan
 kute ko jitna zyada puraskrit kiya jayega, vah vishesh rup se sudrudh ho jayega, adhik sudrudheekaran praapt karne ke liye vah zyada taiyaari karegaa, yaa behatar kaam karegaa
 sirf kute kii uplabdhi ko lekar khush hona unke liye puraskaar hi he
 For example, some dog trainers recommend behavior that you particularly favor
 Maybe your dog or puppy likes to eat liver cheese as a reward
 haalanki, is baat kaa hameshaa dhyaan rakhen ki ek sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran ke rup main aap use jo khilaa rahen hai, vah swasthkar ho or aapke kute yaa pille ke samgr swasthya ko koi kshati na pahunchaae
 Some trainers fulfill the puppy's desire for a particular toy for their training, so that the toy becomes a stronger positive reinforcement factor for good behavior
 This process is called "creating a desire to hunt" and is commonly used in identifying narcotics and dogs working in the police service
 iskaa lakshya hota he ek aisa kutta bananaa jo apane vishesh khilone ke puraskaar ko paane kii aashaa main, lambe samay tak swatantra rup se kaam karegaa
 of traditional forms of punishment has been minimized by modern dog trainers
 ek kute ko aamtaur par is prakaar kii sajaa keval tabhi di jaati he jab kutta maalik kii baat ko bilkul bhi nahin maan rahaa he or maalik ko kisi gambhir sthiti main kute kii suraksha kii zarurat he
 Punishment is effectively combined with teaching the dog the desired behavior, but it is not the only solution, as it will instill a sense of fear in the dog and he is not ready to cooperate if he is not taught the desired behavior
 Will happen
 sajaa kaa upyog keval tabhi kiya janaa chahie jab yah kute ke vyaktitv, aayu anubhav or shaareerik or bhaavnaatmak sthiti ke anusaar upyukt ho
 kuch kutton ke saath agar kathor aawaaj main baat kii jaye to ve dar jate hai yaa chintit ho jate hai
 Some other dogs do not pay attention to such verbal reprimand
 kuch kute pani se darane lagate hai, jab unamem sudhaar karne ke liye un par pani chhidka jaataa he
 Many dog owners teach their dogs tricks
 gardan main baandhne kii chok zanjeer : gardan main baandhne kii zanjeer dhaatu kii kadiyon se bani hoti he, jiske ek sire par ek bada gol challa hota he
 This chain is taken out of one of these rings and worn with the dog's head
 jab kutta avaanchhneeya vyavhaar karata he to is zanjeer ko kas diya jaataa he
 It is used primarily in traditional dog training
 prong zanjeer Collar): prong zanjeer dhaatu kii kadiyon se bani hoti he jinhen aapas main lambe, aamtaur par bhunte, daanton ke madhyam se feet kiya jaataa he, in daanton ke sire andar kii ore kute kii gardan kii taraf hote hai

 He composed the Shahnama which later became the national epic of Persia
 isamen unhone saatvin sadi main faras par arabi fatah ke pehle ke iran ke bare main likhaa he
 Firdausi was born in 920 AD in a town called Tus in Khorasan
 asadi naamak kavi ne use shiksha di or kavita kii ore prerit kiya
 He gave him a treatise on the mythological kings of Iran, on the basis of which Firdausi composed the Shahnama
 isamen 60,000 sher hai
 He was busy with this great work for 35 years and completed it on 25 February 1010 AD
 is samay vah 85 varsh kaa ho chukaa tha
 He dedicated this poem to Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi who conquered Khorasan in 999 AD
 use keval 20 hajaar dirham pradaan kiye gaye
 Firdausi's body was set on fire
 vah apane desh se hiraat kii ore bhaaga kintu bhaagane se purv ek kavita shahname main jod gaya, jisamen sultan mahmud kii ghor ninda kii gai he
 In the Shahnama, Firdausi praised the legendary emperor of Iran, whose exploits he was greatly influenced by, the elder
 uski kavita se pracheen iran ke prati uskaa prem evam arabon ke prati ghrinaa kaa puraa abhas miltaa he
 In order to possibly satisfy the staunch Muslims, he later wrote Yusuf Zulikha, a masnavi dedicated to the Bavid ruler Bahauddaula and his son Sultanuddaula
 taduparant vah apni mathrubhumi toos laut aayaa or vahiin uski mrityu hui 
 His grave is in the sights of Iran
 kaha jaataa he, jab uskaa janaaza paas ke ek gaanv ke phatak se nikal rahaa tha, ek kaaravaan sultan mahmud ke bheje hue 60,000 dinar lekar pahunchaa jinaki kavi ko aashaa thi
 Firdausi's daughter put all the money in charity
 shahnamaa kii badi hi sundar sachitr hastlipiyaan sansar ke bade bade sangrahalayon main surakshit hai
 Its editions were published from Calcutta in 1878 AD from Paris in 1878 and Lyden from 1877-1885 AD
 taduparant bharat or iran se anek sanskaran prakashit hue
 Its translations have been published in many languages of the world
 kaha jaataa he ki mahmud gazanvi ne firdausi ko yah vachan diya tha ki vah 'shahnamaa' ke har shabd ke liye ek dinar degaa
 After years of hard work, when the 'shahnama' was ready and Firdausi took him to the court of Mahmud Ghaznabi, the emperor paid him a dirham, not a dinar for every word
 kaha jaataa he is par naaraaz hokar firdausi laut gaya or usne ek dirham bhi nahin liya
 This promise was something like that a penny should be given to a poet by paying a rupee per word
 firdausi ne gusse main aakar mahmud gazanabi ke khilaaf kuch panktiyaan likhi
 Those lines were so influential that they spread throughout the empire
 kuch saal baad mahmud gazanvi se uske vishwaasapaatr mantriyon ne nivedan kiya ki firdausi ko usee dar par bhugtan kar diya jaye jo tay kii gayi thi
 When asked about the reason of the emperor, the Prime Minister said that in every corner of the empire we go, we get to hear the lines that Firdausi has written against you and we just bow down in shame
 use nirdhaarit dar par paisa de diya jaayegaa to hamen bada naitik bal milegaa
 The Emperor gave the order
 dinaaron se bhari gaadi jab firdausi ke ghar pahunchi to ghar ke andar se firdausi kaa janaaza nikal rahaa tha
 Firdausi was dead after spending his entire life in poverty, poverty and failure
 kehete hai ki firdausi kii ekmaatr santan uski ladki ne bhi yah dhan lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 In this way the emperor remained a debtor of the poet and still is today
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj firdausi kaa shahnamaa jitna prasiddh he utani hi yaa usase zyada prasiddh ve panktiyaan he jo firdausi ne mahmud gazanabi kii aalochana karte hue likhi thim
 Firdausi's 'shahnama' is not only the history of Iran but the identity of Iranian identity
 usamen pracheen iran kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan he
 Emperors have a history
 pracheen farsi granthon ko nayaa rup dekar unako shaamil kiya gaya he
 a wonderful effect has arisen from the blending of myth and history
 prem, vidroh, veerta, dushtataa, maanviyata, yuddh, saahas ke aise utkrisht udhaaharan hai jinhone 'shahnamaa' ko irani sahitya kii amar kriti bana diya he
 No other book has appeared in Iranian literature as often as 'shahnama' has been printed
 firdausi ne rustam or soharaab jaise paatr nirmit kiye hai jo maanav-smriti kaa hissaa ban chuke hai
 There is a beautiful garden around the tomb of Firdausi, as Iranians have done with their great poets
 idhar-udhar unki pratimaayein lagi hai
 Special episodes of his poetry are engraved on marble

 sikh dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Yashodharman was the Maharaja of Malwa in the early period of the sixth century
 chhathi shatee i0 ke dwitiya charan main malwa praant ke sthaneey shaasha ke rup se aage badhkar yashodharman puure uttari bharat par chaa gaya
 He rose at a rapid pace like a meteor and he disappeared from history without leaving a clear impact
 yashodharman kii utpatti or praarambhik itihaas ke vishay main kuch nahin gyaat he
 In one of his inscriptions he is said to be of Aulikar dynasty
 is vansh ke log paanchavin shatabdi ke madhya main gupt samrajya ke samant ke rup main malwa par shashan kar rahe the
 But after that, there is no information of this dynasty for almost a hundred years
 gupton kii shakti ksheen ho chali thi
 The political situation of Malwa was unstable due to the invasions of the Vakatakas and Hunas
 aise main yashodharman jaise mahatvakankshi or yogya vyakti ke liye apana prabhaav badhanaa saral tha
 Our knowledge of Yashodharman is limited to his two records from Mandsaur
 ek abhilekh main kaha gaya he ki uskaa prabhutv lauhitya se mahendra parvat tak or himalay se pashchimi sagar tak failaa tha
 This description is of the traditional Digvijay
 in prashastiyon main atishyokti kaa ansh avashya hoga kintu is prakaar ke daawey nitant niraadhaar nahin kahe ja sakate
 It is also said in the inscription that their authority was also over the territories which were not in the possession of Gupta kings and Hunas
 uske praantpal abhayadutt ke adhikaar main vindhyas or paariatr ke bich kaa pradesh tha jo arab sagar tak failaa tha
 There is no mention of which dynasties he defeated in connection with the conquest of this vast empire
 abhilekh main uske dwaara parajeet shatruon main keval mihirkul kaa ho naam diya gaya he
 Mihirkul was also defeated by the Gupta King Baladitya
 is ghatana ke saath yashodharman ke krityon ko kalkram main rakhana kathin he
 The victory of Yashodharman and Baladitya is the same event, or Yashodharman as the feudatory of Baladitya later defeated Mihirkul and later established his independent power, or Mihirkul was defeated in two places - Yashodharman in the west and Baladitya in the east or He was defeated first by Yashodharman and then by Baladitya etc
 It is not possible to tell any definite possibility
 yuvan chwad ke anusaar baladitya ke haathon parajeet hone par bhi mihirkul ne apana sir jhukaana nahin sweekaar kiya or kashmir main jaakar apana adhikaar sthapit kiya
 If we see the similarity of Mihirkul's description in Mandsor inscription, it can be said that Mihikul's second defeat was at the hands of Yashodharman
 shaktishaalee hunon or gupton ko parajeet karnaa yashodharman kii pramukh uplabdhiyaan thi
 His flourishing period was after 528 AD
 kintu uski vijay sthaayee nahin rah sakin
 In 543 AD, we find no influence of Yashodharman's dominance
 phir bhi uskaa yah mahatv avashya tha ki usne apane udhaaharan se anya saamanton ko utsahit kiya jinaki badhati shakti or tajjanit sangharsh ke falswaroop gupt samrajya chhin bhinn ho gaya
 The second name of Yashodharman was Vishnuvardhana
 usne rajadhirajaprameshwar or samrajt kii oopaadhi dhaaran kii thi
 He was a devotee of Shiva
 abhilekh main uske achche shashan or uske sadgunon ke kai ullekh hai
 He has been compared to Manu, Bharata, Alark and Mandhata
 ki apane samay main hi use vishesh gaurav praapt hua tha
