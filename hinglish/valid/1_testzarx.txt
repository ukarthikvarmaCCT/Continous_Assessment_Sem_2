 Lack of pre-existing belief is accepted, the feeling of experience behind it has not yet arrived; What is not at the beginning and the end is the same in the present "the way dreams and maya are seen, as Gandharvanagar looks, similarly the pandits have seen this world in Vedanta
 ' Gaudapada's argument has two parts - jaagran or swapn main kai moulik bhed hai-- Shvetashvatar Upanishad "has three elements

 With all surgeries there are some risks that must be evaluated before performing the procedures
 However, the risks are different depending on the condition of the appendix

 Various complications showed no significant difference
 According to this study, beginning antibiotic therapy and delaying appendicectomy from the middle of the night to the next day does not significantly increase the risk of pimples or other complications
 This finding is simply for the convenience of surgeons and staff involved, but the fact is that there are other studies that have shown that surgery is taking place during the night, when people may be more tired and there are fewer staff available

 gulia ek jat gotra he
 Guliya originates from the ancient Kulya caste
 yah puraana ke kulya ke vansh jaise hai
 The Markandaya Purana mentions it with the Matasyaas of Central India
 bhimsingh daahiya bataate hai matsay puraana kulia naam ke logon ko zikr karte hai
 Dahiya says that now coming to the interstate region, it is seen that the descendants of some castes are still known as Galat
 mandator or gulia vansh aisa mana jaataa he ki yah greek ke galatens lekhakon se sambandhit he jo itihaasik rup se europe ke log hai
 This is a doubt whose discovery is indispensable
 bhimsingh daahiya varadak ke lekhan ke bare main likhte hai ki kareeb 129 main baramaaregaa dwaara bhagwaan budhd ke stupa ke sthapana ke samay sambandh rakhti he, yah skion ke kama gulia ko bhi yaad dilaati he
 According to Bird Dahiya, during the reign of Prithviraj Chauhan, Rohtak area of badli village was ruled by King Badra Sun
 kuch samay baad do vyakti saiyad sarkaar, nasir hossain masahaade or ataulla masahade kabul se baldi bhira saiyad ke nerttva main haaryana ko nasht karne aaye or badra sen ko markar naye shashan praapt kiye
 In 1192, in the Battle of Tarai, Mohammad Ghori defeated Prithviraj and won the war
 us yudhd ke dauraan saat brahmin sainik vahaan se bhagkar dakshin baldi ke mandir main sharan liya
 He was the son of Uday Chand of Indragad
 unka naam ousar, rahal, asal, mahal or chahal tha
 They considered the wine to be water and drank it and destroyed the purity of Brahmin
 vahiin se ve apane paas vaale ghade par dhaagaa bandhna shuru kiya
 Since then these Brahmin people came to be known as Gulia, who later started living near Buldi
 unka praarambhik itihaas is tarah bahut hi avishwasaneey or jatil rah rahaa he
 Ram Swaroop writes in June that the Baran of Gulia clan has written something incredible about the origin of this clan
 aisa lagata he ki vah ek lambey samay ke baad ghatana ne likhaa he jab tathyon bhul gaya tha
 But there is another story that is authentic
 donon sanskarnon neeche die gaye hai
 During the rule of a village of Charan, Prithvi Raj Chauhan, Badli, Rohtak, according to King Badra Sen was ruled by two Sayyid chieftains, Nasir Hussain Mashade and Ata-ullah Mashade from Kabul, came to Badli under the leadership of Bir Syed Hussain
 To destroy Haryana and he became the ruler after the planned assassination of Roras and Kalals as Badra Sen Way Tillers
 1192 main mohammad gori traori or prithvi raaj kii ladaai main vijayi maaraa gaya tha
 Seven Brahmin soldiers fled from the area and hid in a pond three miles south of Badli

 Their names were Ausar, Dausar, Rahal, Ashal, Mahal and Chahal etc
 They understood liquor as water and drank it
 brahman ke rup main unki pavitrataa is prakaar pradooshit ho gaya tha
 They put their sacred thread round one
 isliye ve gulia jat kaha jaataa tha or ve mohammadans ke kiraayedaaron ke rup main badali main bas gaye
 But the story is not possible on the field
 sabase pehle 1192 se pehle, prithvi raaj mohammadans ke samay kabhi nahin vahaan shashan kiya
 Secondly, when they ran away from the battlefield, they could directly run to the Indergraha

 Fourth, alcohol should not be mistaken for water so easily

 According to the Charan of the Gulia clan, Prithvi Raj Chauhan, Badli, Rohtak during the rule of a village, King Badra Sen was ruled by two Saiyad chiefs, Nasir Hussain Mashade and Ata-ullah Mashade, who came from Kabul for Badli under Bir Syed Hussain

 The Murtia road established in the temple of Badarsain dates to the time of King Mahalasi

 There was a Muslim attack on the road, which benefited the Guliya people

 He was the son of Udaya Chand Brahmin of Irgraha

 His piety as a Brahmin was thus polluted

 They were therefore called Gulia Jats and settled in Badli as Muslim tenants

 a tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a large low pressure center and heavy thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain

 They are produced by different heating systems than other cyclone thunderstorms such as nor'easter, European thunderstorms and polar lows, leading to the classification of their "hot center" thunderstorm system
 Tropical cyclones begin in the calm tropics at a distance of 10 degrees from the equator

 Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditions
 They also carry heat and energy from the tropics and transport them to temperate latitudes, making them an important part of the world's atmospheric circulation system

 a strong tropical cyclone will harbor an area of sinking air at the center of circulation
 yadi yah kshetra kaaphi majboot he, to yah ek bade "netra" main viksit ho saktaa hai netra ke andar kaa mausam aam taur par shant or badalon se rahit hota he, yadhyapi samudr atyant hinsak ho saktaa he
 The eye is normally round in shape and is between 3 km and 370 km in diameter

 The eyewall is a circle of strong thunderstorms around the eye; This is the place where the strongest winds are found, where the clouds reach the highest and the intensity is heaviest
 hawa se sabase baari kshati vahaan hoti he jahaan ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat kaa yaaol jameen par se gujarata he
 Eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in intense tropical cyclones
 jab chakravaat tivrata ke shikhar tak pahunch jate hai unamem aamtaur par ek iwal or adhiktam hawa kii trigya hoti he jo ek bahut chote aakaar main simat jaati he, jo lagbhag 10 kilometre se 25 kilometre tak hoti he
 The outer rainband can form an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly move inward and snatch the required moisture and angular momentum from the inner eyewall
 jab aantarik iwal kamazor pad jaataa he, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhi kamazor pad jaataa he bahari iwal aantarik iwal ko chakra ke ant main puri tarah se pratisthapit kar detaa he
 Thunderstorms can be of the same intensity as they were before, or may be even more intense after the eyewall replacement cycle is complete
 tufaan phir se teevr ho saktaa he kyonki vah agle yaaol pratisthaapan ke liye phir se ek nai bahari ring kaa nirmaan karata he
 The size of a tropical cyclone is determined by measuring the distance from its center to its outermost closed balance line, also known as ROCI
 yadi trigya aksharekha se do degree kam yaa 222 kilometre he, tab chakravaat "bahut chota" yaa ek "bouna" hota he
 a radius between 3 and 6 degrees of latitude or 333 kilometers to 670 kilometers is considered "average size"
 "bahut bade" ushnkaribandheey chakravaat 8 degree se bhi adhik yaa 888 kilometre kii ek trigya liye hue hote he
 The use of this measure has virtually determined that tropical cyclones of the Northwest Pacific Ocean are, on average, the largest on Earth and Atlantic tropical cyclones are about half their size
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat aakaar nirdhaaran kii anya vidhiyon main shaamil he aandhi ke bal vaali hawaaon ke trigya ko maapna or uski sambandhi vortisiti kshetra trigya ko maapna ek centre aandhi bal ke daayre main shaamil maapne hawaaon or maapne iske daayre main jo apane rishtedaar se −1 kshetra ke liye kam ho jaati he vorticity −5 1 × 10
 The primary energy source of a tropical cyclone is the heat of condensation emitted from condensed water vapor at extremely high altitudes, where solar heat is the initial source of evaporation
 isliye, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko ek vishaal urdhwadhar taap engine ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he jo prithvi ke gurutvkarshan or ghurnan jaise bhautik yantriki balon dwaara sanchalit hota he
 In another form, tropical cyclones can be seen as a special type of mesoscale convective complex, which continues to form over a vast source of relative moisture and heat
 jabaki ek praarambhik garm kor pranali, jaise ek sangathit toofaan sankul ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke gathan ke liye aavashyak he, vayumandaleey dabaav ko kam karne ke liye urja ke pravaah kii jarurat hoti he

 This positive response continues until conditions are favorable for tropical cyclone development
 aise kaarak jaise vaayu raashi ke vitaran main santulan kaa nirantar abhaav, chakravaat ke liye samarthan urja pradaan karegaa
 The rotation of the Earth induces the rotation of this system and this effect is known as the Coriolis effect, which gives it the characteristics of a cyclone and affects the direction of the storm
 jo tathy ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ko anya mausami ghatnaon se mukhya rup se pruthak karata he vah ek preran bal ke rup main gahan sanvahan
 kyonki sanvahan, ushnkaribandheey jalwaayu main majboot hota he, yah ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke praarambhik domen ko paribhaashit karata he
 In contrast, mid-latitude cyclones draw most of their energy from pre-existing horizontal temperatures

 When a tropical cyclone passes over land, its heat source is cut off from it and it loses its strength
 samudr ke upar se ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke guzarane se samudr kii upree parat kaaphi thandi ho jaati he, jo baad main chakravaat ke vikaas ko prabhavit kar sakati hai
 This cooling occurs mainly due to the rise of cold water from the depths of the ocean due to wind

 It is a negative reinvestment process that weakens the storm over the ocean due to its own effect
 varsha ke jal se atirikt thandapan ho saktaa he kii dar se urja jari karata he, jo 1 PW ke baraabar he
 This energy discharge rate is 70 times the world's energy consumption and gives 200 times the worldwide electric potential or is equivalent to the detonation of a 10 megaton nuclear bomb per minute
 haalanki badalon kaa gaman spasht rup se kendra kii ore hota he, ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton main ek upree str par bhi badalon kaa pravaah viksit hota he
 This storm is generated at high altitude through the engine's "chimney" that the air expels through and through its moisture

 The clouds are quite thin and the sun can be seen through it
 ye ucch sirus badal, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke ek praarambhik sanket ho sakate hai
 When the windstorm moves away from the eye of the storm, the tornado is reduced, then the outflow from a tropical cyclone will induce anti-cyclone motion

 In most situations, the minimum water temperature is 26
5 ° C
 Needs are down to a depth of at least 50 m॰, this water temperature is sufficient to cause the atmosphere to cause overflowing thunderstorms and to maintain convection
 Another aspect is the rapid cooling with height, which allows a release of tropical forces that condensate heat
 High humidity is needed to center the troposphere, in particular, in the low, when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere, to adapt to disturbances and conditions are developed

 By most names, the hurricane activity band forms a worldwide tropical cyclone: the Intertropical Front, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or the monsoon trough
 Another important source of atmospheric instability is the tropical wave that is found, which causes about 85% of the intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, and most become tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific basin

 The tropical system, while generally located at the equator of the 20th parallel ward, is steered to the westward high pressure zone of the continental side of the subtropical ridge, mainly an east-west side of the continent's oceans
 Waves in the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast of the Pacific Oceans, trade winds preceding the Pacific Pacific wind waves moving westward to the west for another name - tropical westward pointing towards the Central Coast and Caribbean Sea, North America and finally Africa To get wet out of There are many traders for these tropical cyclones within the area of these waves

 Storms moving towards Asia via the Pacific Ocean, for example, will divert offshore to the north, northeast of Japan and then, if the typhoon Siberia encounters blowing winds around a low pressure system over China
 Many tropical cyclones are subtly forced from cyclone to northeast, which in this manner move from northeast to west to east to the subtropical ridge
 a tropical example of a cyclone in recurve was a trajectory IOK storm in 2006, which looked similar

 When two cyclones approach each other, their centers will start orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems
 The two vortices will be attracted to each other and eventually spiral and merge at the center point
 When the two vortices are of uneven size, the interaction with the larger vortex will dominate and the smaller vortex will orbit around it
 This phenomenon is called the Fujiwara effect, followed by Sakuhe Fujiwara ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke liye kai alag-alag tareekon ke madhyam se ushnkaribandheey visheshtaayen hai sangharsh kar sakate hai
 One such method is if it runs on land, thus the deprived water needs to warm it to power itself, quickly losing strength
 The fastest strong hurricanes lose their strength very soon after landfall and become developed in S

 Hurricanes have many fatalities in mountainous areas, as do the storms leading to torrential rains, and the deadly floods of mudslide, similar to those that occurred in 1998 with the Mitch storm
 Additionally, overhead dissipation can also occur if a storm remains in the same area of the ocean for long, mixing 60 meters of water

 1960s and 1970s United States government attempts to weaken through project stormfury by choosing to sow storms with silver yodid
 It was thought that seeding rhombuses would cause cold freeze in the outer water, causing the internal eyewall to collapse and thus reducing winds

 Other approaches have suggested the time is under towing by tropical cyclones, including water cooling under icebergs
 In the tropical oceans, in addition to cyclone along with other ideas, evaporation prevents substances that cover a range of ocean or destroy nuclear weapons
 Project Cirrus Cyclone also involves throwing on a dry ice
 All of these approaches: One drawback above many sufferers is that tropical tropical cyclones are practical enough to do any technique to remain too large and small to weaken

 Intensive tropical cyclones pose a particular challenge, as they are a dangerous marine and weather station event, being relatively infrequent, are rarely available at the site of the storm itself
 Surface observations are generally available only if the storm is on an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship passing by

 In real-time measurements in place, reconnaissance flights in cyclones can be taken by sending specially equipped
 In the Atlantic Basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters
 The aircraft are used WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Oryons, both four-engine turboprop aircraft cargo
 These planes fly directly in the cyclone and carry direct and remote sensing measurements
 Cyclone Dropsonde also launched GPS inside the aircraft
 These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure and level of flight and especially winds between the ocean surface
 a new era in hurricanes began observing when the remotely controlled aircraft Erosonde, a small drone, was sent through the Ophelia storm as it passed the 2005 Hurricane Noise during the tropical weather of eastern Virginia
 One such mission was also successfully completed in the western Pacific Ocean

 The forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate predictions, depend on the position and strength of high and low pressure areas to determine the cause of the track, and how those areas predict how a tropical system will change during life
 Depth wind or average, mean flow through the deep layer troposphere, is considered the best tool in determining motion track and direction
 If the storms are significantly sheared, the use of wind measurements at a lower wind speed, altitude will yield better predictions
 The tropical storm economy also considers smoothing out the shorter than the period Wobbles as this trajectory allows them to determine a longer and more accurate trajectory

 However, scientists are not as efficient at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones
 The lack of improvement in intensity forecasts is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and the factors that influence their development have an incomplete understanding

 Tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups, based on intensity: tropical depressions, tropical storms and a third group of more intense storms, whose name depends on the region
 For example, if a tropical storm in the northwest Pacific reaches the Beaufort power on the winds scale, the storm is referred to as a typhoon, if a tropical storm is in the Atlantic or in the nearby benchmark basin in the northeast Pacific, This is the one called storm
 Neither "hurricane" nor "typhoon" is performed in either the thunderstorm southern hemisphere or the Indian Ocean

 Additionally, as indicated in the table below, each basin terminology uses a different system, making it difficult to compare between different basins
 In the Pacific Ocean, storms across the Pacific Northwest date from the Pacific Northwest, sometimes becoming the central line in the Central Line; On rare occasions, the reverse will occur
 It should be greater than even with sustained winds that said typhoon 67 meters per second or 150 mph by the combined typhoon called Super Typhoon

 At this point, the characteristic cyclone begins to develop, although an eye is not usually present

 a typhoon or hurricane is a system for resisting hurricanes or a system with sustained winds at least 33 m per second or 74 mph
 To make a cyclone of this intensity the development of an eye goes in relation to the center of circulation

 The eyeball is about the surrounding eyewall, an area about 16 kilometers to 80 kilometers wide which has a strong storm and the winds circulate around the storm
 Tropical cyclones in strong maximum sustained winds have been estimated at about 85 m per second or 195 mph

 The record on the most intense hurricane was the typhoon tip ocean in 1979, from which the constant wind speed reached a maximum maximum pressure of 870 mbar and 25

 The tip, however, does not hold only for a record of sustained strong winds in the cyclone
 The storm currently shares this record with the Atlantic at Keith and North Pacific in Keith and Alan Keith
 Camille's land strike was the only hurricane in fact, while doing that, with intensity at 165 knots or 190 mph sustained winds and 183 knots or 210 mph gusts, the strongest tropical cyclone on landfall record
 Typhoon Nancy recorded in 1961 the wind speed was 185 knots or 215 mph, but recent research suggests that 1940s to 1940s have also been high for wind speeds and the highest speed winds on record are now storms

 Likewise, 205 knots or 235 mph were recorded in the gust due to a thunderstorm by Guam Paca at a surface level

 Proxy research based on paleotempestological records has shown that major hurricanes of activity along the Gulf Coast of Mexico have varied over the millennia over the timescales
 Some of the major Hurricanes 3000–1400 BC Hit the Gulf Coast during and again during the most recent millennium
 It was a period of silence in 1400 BC by a hyperactive period
 And were separated during a rise of 3-5 times by 1000 AD, when the Gulf Coast was frequently hit by catastrophic Hurricanes and their landfall prospects

 The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's geo-fluid dynamics laboratory performs simulation over time to determine if there is a statistical power trend or frequency in tropical cyclones

 Apart from tropical cyclones, there are two other classes of cyclones within the cyclone type spectrum
 is prakaar ke chakravaat ko atiriktaushnkaribandheey chakravaat or uposhnkaribandheey chakravaat ke rup main janaa jaataa he or inke gathan or kshay ke madhyam se ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko ye janm de sakate hai
 An extratropical cyclone is a type of storm that receives energy from a horizontal temperature abnormality, which is typical in high expanses
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat atiriktaushnkaribandheey ban sakate hai, kyonki yadi isaki urja strot, sanghanan dwaara jari garmi se vaayu khandon ke bich taapmaana main bhinnata paidaa karti he to yah upar kii ore vistaar karti he; iske alaava atiriktaushnkaribandheey chakravaat ushnkaribandheey tufaan main bhi tabadil ho sakate hai or uske baad ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ban jate hai, haalanki aisa aksar nahin hota
 From space, extratropical storms have a characteristic "coma-shaped" cloud pattern
 atiriktaushnkaribandheey chakravaat bhi khatarnaak ho sakate hai jab tej hawaaon or ucch laharon ke kaaran unamem kam dabaav kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some features of an extratropical cyclone
 ve bumadhya rekha se 50° tak oonchai kii ek vistrut katibandh ko paidaa kar sakati hai
 Although subtropical storms rarely have stormy winds, they can be tropical in nature if they are heated
 prakriya kii drushti se, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko apane atiriktaushnkaribandheey parivartan ke dauraan aam taur par uposhnkaribandheey banane par vichaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 In popular culture, tropical cyclones appear in a variety of media including film, book, television, music, and electronic games
 media main ushnkaribandheey chakravaat puri tarah se kalpana par aadhaarit ho sakate hai, yaa vaastavik ghatnaon par aadhaarit ho sakate hai
 For example, George Rippey Stewart's Storm, a best-seller publication in 1941, is believed to have influenced meteorologists by naming the name of Pacific Tropical Cyclones

 In addition, Fantasy Storm, has been featured in parts of the series' narratives such as The Simpson, Invasion, Family Guy, Seinfeld, Dawson Creek, and CSI Miami
 The 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow features several tropical cyclones, as well as a "storm-like" non-tropical Arctic storm

 ) According to mythology, there was a king named Sudhanwa in ancient times
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi ek baar parashar muni ko uski naav par baith kar yamuna paar karnaa padaa
 Parashar Muni Satyavati became enamored of beauty and said, "devi! i want to cum with you
 " satyavati ne kaha, "muniver! aap brahmagyani hai or main nishad kanya
 We do not have sex
 " tab parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " itnaa kah kar unhone apane yogabal se chaaron ore ghaney kuhare kaa jaal rach diya or satyavati ke saath bhoga kiya
 After that, while blessing him, he said, the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrant
 " When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas

 purv main hua tha
 Vedanta Darshan, the founder of monotheism, was the son of Vedavyasa sage Parashar
 patni aaruni se utpann inke putr the mahaan bal yogi shukdev
 The Shrimad Bhagwat Gita is a part of the world's largest epic 'mahabharata'
 ramnagar ke kile main or vyas nagar main vedavyas kaa mandir he jahow magh main prayek somvaar mela lagata he
 The famous festival of Guru Purnima is celebrated to commemorate the birth anniversary of Vyas ji
 puraanon tathaa mahabharat ke rachayita maharishi kaa mandir vyasapuri main vidyaman he jo kaashi se paanch mile kii duuri par sthit he
 In the Ramnagar fort of Maharaja Kashi Naresh, there is a statue of Vyeshwar in the western part, which is known by the common people as Chhota Ved Vyas
 vastav main vedavyas kii yah sab se pracheen murti he
 Visvesvara expelled Vyasji from Kashi due to Vyasji cursing Kashi
 tab vyasaji lolark mandir ke aagney kone main gangaji ke purvi tat par sthit hue
 The mention of this incident in Kashi section is as follows- lolarkadan agnidigbhage, swarghuni purvarodhsi
 Situ Hydyapya Pashchets: Kashiprasad Rajikam
 
 Skanda Purana, Kashi Block 96 / 201 vyasaji ne puraanon tathaa mahabharat kii rachana karne ke pashchaat brahmasutron kii rachana bhi yahan kii thi
 Like Valmiki, Vyas is also a derivative of Sanskrit poets
 mahabharat main upakhyanon kaa anusaran kar anek sanskrit kaviyon ne kavy, naatak aadi kii sristi kii he
 In relation to the Mahabharata itself, Vyasji's statement is more accurate - what is in this text is elsewhere, but what is not in it is nowhere else
 kalapi main yamuna ke kisi dweep main inkaa janm hua tha
 Vyasji was called Krishna Dwaipayana because his color was black
 ve paidaa hote hi maan kii ajna se tapasya karne chale gayi the or kah gayi the ki jab bhi tum samaran karogi, main aa jaaoongaa
 He was not only the father of Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidur, but he also supported the Pandavas in the form of a shadow in times of calamity
 unhone teen varshon ke athak parishram se mahabharat granth kii rachana kii thi- Tribhirvarshe: Sadotthayi Krishnadvaipayanomuni:
 mahabharatamakhyaanan kritvaadi mudtamam
 
 adiparv - When he saw the deterioration of religion, he made Vyasa, the department of Veda, and called Ved Vyas
 vedon kaa vibhaag kar unhone apane shishy sumantu, jaimini, pel or vaishampayan tathaa putr shukdev ko unka adhyayan karaayaa tathaa mahabharat kaa upadesh diya
 Because of your supernatural talent, you are considered an incarnation of God
 sanskrit sahitya main valmiki ke baad vyas hi sarvshereshth kavi hue hai
 His poetry is known by the name of 'arsha Kavya'
 vyas ji kaa uddeshy mahabharat likh kar yuddh kaa varnan karnaa nahin, balki is bhautik jivan kii ni:sarataa ko dikhaanaa he
 His statement is that even if a man gets to know the Vedang and the Upanishads, he can never be learned because this Mahabharata is simultaneously economics, theology and kamshastra

 Later, when Aryan looks in the mirror, it is written in it that Gaurav has created Aryan
 aryan apane agle kaarykram ke liye ek arbapati ke shaadi main jaataa he
 There too, Gaurav takes his form like Aryan and starts dancing there with the daughter of that billionaire

 aryan ek yojana banaata he or gaurav jis ladki se pyaar karte rahata he, usase aryan apane aap ko gaurav bataa kar apane pyaar kaa izhaar kar detaa he
 This incident provokes pride and Aryan sees her
 gaurav vahaan se bhaagane lagata he or aryan uskaa peechha karne lagata he
 After that the fight between the two begins
 aryan use kahata he ki vah aryan banane ke jagah gaurav bane
 After this Gaurav says that he said everything but has not apologized yet
 iske baad vah pahaad se girte rahata he ki aryan use pakad letaa he
 Gaurav then replies that he will never understand her
 iske saath hi vah apana haath chhudaa letaa he
 He falls down smiling and dies
