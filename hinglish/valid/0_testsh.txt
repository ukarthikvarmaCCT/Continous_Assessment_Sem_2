 Annie Besant's supporters now swear
 ve sitambar tak intjaar karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 They pressurized Annie Besant to seek permission to establish the Homerul Group
 jamanadas dwarkadas, shankaralal baker or indulal yajyanik ne bombay main ek akhbaar ‘yang india’ kaa prachlan shuru kiya or angreji tathaa kshetray bhashaa main parache nikaalane ke liye desh ke kone-kone se chandaa ikattha karne lage
 Annie Besant waited until September
 congress puri tarah niskriy thi
 He also announced the establishment of the Home Rule League and appointed his supporter George Arundel as the Organization Secretary
 tilak or ani bessent ne apni-apni lig ke liye kaaryakshetron kaa bantwaaraa bhi kar diya, jisase kahin koi gadbady na ho
 Tilak's league was the responsibility of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Berar
 desh ke baaki hisse ani bessent kii lig ke jimme thi
 These two did not merge
 kaaran tha ani bessent ke kuch samarthak tilak ko pasand nahin karte the tathaa tilak ke kuch samarthak ani bessent ko, lekin un donon ke bich kisi prakaar kaa jhagada nahin tha
 Tilak visited Maharashtra
 homerul aandolan kaa khub prachaar kiya
 Explained to the public why it is needed, what are its objectives
 unheen ke shabdon main, ‘‘bharat us bete kii tarah he, jo jawan ho chukaa he
 The time is right for the father or foster to give his rightful rights to this son
 bhartiya janata ko ab haq lenaa hi hoga
 They have every right to it
 ’’ tilak ne kshetray bhashaa main shiksha or bhashaai rajyon kii maang ko ‘swaraj’ kii maang se jod diya
 He said, "the demand for the formation of provinces on the basis of Marathi, Telugu, Kannada and other languages means that the medium of instruction should be the regional language
 kya angrej apane yahan logo ko francisi kii shiksha dete he
 Do Germans teach their people in English or do Turks teach in French
 ’’ 1915 main bombay ke prantiya sammelan me tilak ne gokhale ke nidhan par shok prastaav rakhaa
 Bb As soon as Alur stood up to support it, Tilak said, "speak in Kannada to assert the right to Kannada language
 ’’ isse pataa chalata he ki tilak kshetray marathi sankeernata nahin thi
 Tilak was not a casteist in the cases of untouchables and non-brahmins
 maharashtra ke gaiyr brahmanon ne ek-ek baar sarkaar ko alag se gyaapan bheja ki ucch virgon kii maangon se unka koi sambandh nahin he
 So many people opposed it
 lekin tilak ne in virodh karanevaalo ko samajhaayaa, aap log dhairya se kaam lijie
 If we can convince them that we are with them and there is no difference between their demands and our demands, then i am sure that their movement to eradicate inequality will join our struggle
 ”he explained to non-brahmins that quarrel There is no distinction between Brahmins and non-brahmins between educated and uneducated
 brahman or gaiyr-brahmanon kii tulana main zyada shikshit he
 Therefore, the government advocating for non-brahmins is also forced to recruit Brahmins in government jobs
 sarkaar brahmanon ke prati apane nirankush ravaiye ke baavjood, unhen prashasan main jagah de rahi he kyonki vah maanati he ki padhe likhe log hi prashasan chalaa sakate he
 In a conference organized to eradicate untouchability, Tilak had said, "if God also tolerates untouchability, then i will not believe in God
 ’’ Tilak's speeches made at that time do not reflect religious appeal from anywhere
 homerul kii maang puri tarah dharmanirpekshata par aadhaarit thi
 Tilak said that the reason for opposition from the British is not that he is a follower of any other religion, we oppose them because they are not doing any work in the interest of the Indian public
 tilak ke shabdon main, ‘‘angrej ho yaa musalmaan yadi vah is desh kii janata ke hit ke liye kaam karata he, to vah hamaare liye paraayaa nahin he
 This transgression has no relation with religion or occupation
 yah sidhe-sidhe hiton se jud prashn he
 Tilak intensified his campaign by bringing out six Marathi and two English pamphlets
 in parcho kii 47 hajaar parchiyaan bechi gayi
 Later these leaflets were printed in Gujarati and Kannada languages
 lig kii chah shakhaayen banaai gai
 One each in Central Maharashtra, Bombay City, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh and two in Berar
 homerul aandolan ne jaise-jaise jor pakadana shuru kiya sarkaar ne damanaatmak kaarywahi tej kar di
 The government chose a special day to attack this movement
 23 july 1916 tilak kaa 60 wa janmdin tha
 a large gathering was organized and Tilak was presented a bag of one lakh rupees
 sarkaar ne is avasar par unhen doosraa inaam diya
 He was given a show cause notice
 jisamen likhaa tha ki aapaki gatividhiyon ke chalate aap par pratibandh kyon na laga diya jaae
 He was asked to fill a bond of sixty thousand rupees
 tilak ke liye shaayad sabase mahatvapurn uphaar tha
 He said, "now the Homerul movement will spread like fire in the forest
 sarkari daman vidroh kii aag ko or bhadakayegaa
 '' tilak kii ore se mohammad ali jinna ke netritv main vakeelon kii ek puri team ne mukaddama ladaa
 Tilak lost the case in the magistrate's court but in November he was declared innocent by the High Court
 is jeet kii sabhi ore saraahna hui
 Gandhi wrote in the 'young-india' newspaper, "this is a great victory for freedom of expression
 homerul aandolan ke liye ek bahut badi safalataa he
 "tilak took advantage of this opportunity and said in his public speeches that the government had given permission to express the demand for Homerul or self-government
" tilak or unke sahyogiyon ne prachaar kaary tej kar diya or april 1917 tak unhonen 14 hajaar sadsy bana liye
 The League of Anne Besant also started functioning from September 1916 but their organization was very loose
 koi bhi teen vyakti milakar kahin bhi shakha khol sakate the jabaki tilak kii lig kaa sanghathan bahut majboot tha, sabhi chah shakhaon ke kaam tathaa kaary lenaa nirdhaarit the
 Annie Besant had two hundred branches of the league
 bahut shakhaayen kasbe or nagaron main thim, baaki gaanvon main, ek shakha ke tahat kuchhek gaanv aate the
 Although the Executive Council was elected, the entire work was handled by Annie Besant and her colleagues Arudel, CD Ramaswamy Iyer and BP Wadia
 sadasyon ko nirdesh dene kaa koi sangathit tarika nahin tha
 Either instructions were given to the members individually or by reading Arudel's articles in New India, people knew what to do
 ani bessent kii lig tilak kii lig kii tulana main sadsy banane main peeche rahe
 As of March 1917, the number of members of his league was only 7000
 jawahar laal nehru, bi
chakravarti tathaa je
 banerjee bhi isse shaamil ho gaye
 At present it is difficult to estimate the strength of the League by counting the branches, some of them quite active and some inactive, as they were mostly limited to the activities of the Theosophical Society
 bataur udhaaharan, madras nagar main shakhaon kii sankhya sabase zyada thi, lekin bombay, uttar pradesh ke nagaron or gujarat ke gramin ilaakon kii shakhaayen kaaphi sakriy thi
 Although their number was quite small
 in sari gatividhiyon kaa ek maatra lakshya homerul kii maang ke liye bade paimaane par aandolan chhedana tha
 For this, it was very important to give political education and spark political debate
 arudel ne ‘newindia’ ke madhyam se apane samarthako ko raajnneetik bahes chhedane, rashtriya raajnneeti ke bare main jaankaree dene vaale pustakaalayon kii sthapana, chaatro ko raajnneetik shiksha dene ke liye kakshaon kaa aayojan, doston ke bich ‘homerul’ ke samarthan main tark dene tathaa unhone aandolan main bhagidaari banane ke liye kaary karne ko kaha
 Many branches implemented these
 raajnneetik bahes chalaane par visheshrup se dhyaan diya
 How fast the promotion of Homerule can be gauged from the fact that by September 1916, three lakh leaflets printed from the propaganda fund had been distributed
 yah prachaar fund kuch maheene pehle hi sthapit kiya tha
 In these cases, there was a crude letter from the then government and arguments were made in support of Swaraj
 ani bessent kii lig kii sthapana ke baad in parcho ko phir chapa gaya
 They were also published in many regional languages
 saath-saath jansabhaon kaa aayojan or bhaashanon kaa kram bhi jari rahaa
 Whenever nationwide resistance was called upon for any issue, all the branches of the League supported it
 navambar 1916 main, jab ani bessent par baraar va madhya praant main jane par pratibandh lagaaya gaya, to arudel kii apil par lig kii tamaam shakhaon ne virodh baithken yojit kii or vysarai tathaa grih sachiv ko virodh prastaav bheje
 Similarly, in 1917, when Tilak was banned from going to Punjab and Delhi, protest meetings were held all over the country
 lig kii tamaam shakhaon ne iskaa datakar virodh kiya
 Enraged by the inaction of Grace, many moderate Kan Gracie also joined the Homeroom movement
 gokhale kii ‘sarven t of india sosayadi’ ko lig kaa sadsy banane kii ijaajat nahin thi, lekin unhaan ne janata ke bich bhaashan dekar or parache baan takar ‘homerul aandolan’ kaa samarthan kiya
 Many moderate nationalists in Uttar Pradesh visited the village of Gao, along with Homerule League workers, in preparation for the Congress conference
 inaki zyaadaatar baithak sthaneey adaalaton ke pustakaalayon main hoti, jahaan chaatra, vyavsaayee tathaa anya pesho se jude hue log ikattha hote
 And if the meeting was held on a market day, the farmers who came from the villages would have attended it
 in baithkon main hindustan kii garibi or behaali kaa mudda uthaaya jaataa
 a reminder of the richness of the past and the freedom movement of You Rope was highlighted, it was appealed to take inspiration from it
 in baithkon main hindi bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 The moderates' support of the Home Rule League was not surprising as the League was implementing the political propaganda and academic programs of the moderates
 1916 main congress kaa lakhanu adhiveshan homerul lig ke sadasyon ke liye apni takat dikhaane kaa acha mauka tha
 Tilak's supporters have created a tradition on which the Congress has lived for many years
 unke samarthako ne lakhanu pahunchne ke liye ek train arakshit kii jise kuch logon ne ‘kagrence special’ kaa naam diya, to kuch ne ‘homerul special’ kaha
 Arudel had asked every member of the league to make every effort to become a member of the Lucknow session
 lakhanu congress adhiveshan main tilak ko punah congress main shaamil kar liya gaya
 President Ambika Charan Mazumdar said- isi adhiveshan main mahatvapurn ‘kaan gres lig’ samjhauta hua, jo ‘‘lakhanu pact’’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Annie Besant and Tilak played an important role in this agreement
 madanamohan malviya samet kai varisht netaa iske bilkul khilaaf the
 He alleged that this agreement gives much importance to the Muslim League
 tilak ne is aarope par kaha, ‘‘kuch mahanubhaavon kaa yah aarope he ki hindu apane musalmaan bhaiyon ko zyada tavajjo de rahe hai
 i say that if the right to self-government is given only to the Muslim community, then i would have no objection, if the ambassadors get this right, i do not care, Hindustan should give this right to any community, we have no objection
 meraa yah bayaan samu chi bhartiya rashtriya bhaavana kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Whenever you are fighting a third party, the most important is mutual unity, ethnic unity, religious unity and unity of different political ideologies
 ’’ Tilak was considered a very orthodox Hindu
 vah bhartiya praachya vidya ke prakand vidwaan the
 When he made such a statement, no one dared to oppose anyone else
 haalaanki musalamaanon ke liye alag nirvachan kshetron ke siththant ko swikaarna, vivaadaaspad tha
 But it was accepted that these minorities should not feel that the majority wants to dominate them
 lakhanu adhiveshan main sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kii maang phir uthaai
 Members believed that this demand would be helpful in achieving the goal of Swarajya
 haalanki is maang main ve sari chijen shaamil nahin thi, jaisaa ki homerul lig ke sadsy chaahate the, lekin unhonen is par koi vivaad khadaa nahin kiya
 In any case, he wanted to maintain unity in the Congress
 tilak ne ek or prastaav rakhaa ki congress adhiveshan ke nirnyon tathaa kaaryakramon ko asaliroop dene ke liye ek kaaryakarini kaa gathan kiya jaae
 But this proposal could not be accepted due to opposition from moderates
 vastav main tilak chaahate the ki congress akarmanya na rahe, thodaa or kaam karen
 Tilak's proposal could not be accepted, but four years later, in 1920, when Mahatma Gandhi revised the Congress's constitution and gave it a new look - a form that was necessary to keep a movement going for a long time - he also got Tilak's It was considered necessary to accept this proposal
 congress adhiveshan kii samaapti ke turant baad usee pandal main donon homerul ligon kii baithak hui
 In which about one thousand delegates participated
 congress lig samjhaute kii saraahna kii gai or tilak tathaa ani bessent ne baithak ko sambodhit kiya
 While returning from Lucknow, these two leaders visited many areas of North, Central and Eastern India
 homerul aandolan ke badhate prabhaav ko dekhakar sarkaar kaa chintit hona swaabhaavik tha
 The Madras government became more rigid
 usne chaatro ke raajnneetik baithkon main bhaag lene par pratibandh laga diya
 It was opposed in the whole state
 tilak ne kaha, ‘‘sarkaar ko maaloom he ki desh prem kii bhaavana chaatro ko zyada uttejit karti he
 Anyway, any country can progress only with the strength of the youth
 madras sarkaar ne june 1917 main ani bessent, george arudel tathaa ve
pi
 wadiya ko giraftar kar liya
 There were nationwide protests against it
 sar subrahmanyam ayyar ne sarkari oopaadhi asweekaar kar di
 All moderate leaders like Madan Mohan Malaviya, Surendranath Banerjee and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who were not yet in the league, joined it and raised their voice against the arrest of Annie Besant and other leaders? On 26 July 1917, Tilak said in a meeting to Congress that if the government does not immediately release these people, then a peaceful non-cooperation movement should be launched
 is prastaav ko sabhi prantiya congress samitiyon ke paas manjuuri ke liye bheja gaya
 The Congress committees of Berar and Madras were in favor of immediate action on this, but the other committees were in favor of waiting a little before taking any decision
 gandhiji ke kehane par shankaralal baikar or jamanadas dwarkaprasad ne aise ek hajaar logon ke dastakhat ikatthe kiye jo sarkari adeshon kii avhelnaa karke juluus kii shakl main jaakar ani bessent se milanaa chaahate the
 These people started signing farmers and laborers in support of Swaraj

 There was an unexpected increase in the number of members of the Home Rule League
 is prakaar sarkari daman ne aandolan ko or badhaava diya, aandolankariyon ko or jujharu banaaya
 Montague writes in his diary, "shiva cut his wife into 52 pieces, the same happened to him when the Indian government arrested Annie Besant
" ’’ After these events, the Government of England changed its policies
 ab uskaa ruukh samjhautavaadi ho gaya
 The new Home Secretary Montague made a historic announcement in the House of Commons, "it is the policy of British rule to make the Indian public a partner in the administration of India and the gradual development of various institutions for self-government so that anyone associated with the British Empire in India a responsible government can be established
 ’’ yah bayaan marle ke bayaan se ekadam vipareet tha
 While keeping constitutional reforms in Parliament in 1909, Marley had clearly stated that the aim of these reforms is not to establish self-rule in the country
 mantague kii ghoshnaa kaa sabase bada phayda yah hua ki ab homerul yaa swaraj kii maang ko deshadrohi nahin kaha ja saktaa tha
 But it also did not mean that the British rule was going to accept the demand of Swaraj
 mantague kii ghoshnaa main yah baat bhi thi ki swashaasan kii sthapana tabhi hogi, jab uskaa uchit samay aayega or samay aayaa he yaa nahin iskaa faisla hukumat karegi
 This was enough for the British rule
 isse saaf jaahir tha ki vah bharatiyon ke haath nikat bhavishya main satta saunpane nahin ja rahi thi
 Currently Annie Besant was released in September 1917 due to the announcement of Montague
 is samay ani bessent kii lokapriyata charam seemaa par thi
 In December 1917, at the annual session of the Congress, he was elected president on the proposal of Tilak
 lekin 1918 main anek kaarnon se homerul kamjor pad gaya, 1917 main baari safalataa milane ke baavjood yah aandolan mritpraaya ho gaya
 Moderates had joined the movement, agitated by the arrest of Annie Besant, became inactive after his release
 sarkaar ne sudhaaron kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 These leaders felt that there is no need for this movement
 iske alaava kanoon nishedh aandolan chalaane kii charchaa se bhi ve naaraaz the
 Hence, he had to stop attending congress meetings from September 1918 onwards
 1918 main sudhaar yojanaon kii ghoshnaa se rashtravyapee kheme main ek or daraar pad gai
 Some people were in favor of accepting it as-is and some wanted to reject it completely
 kuch logon kaa maananaa tha ki isamen kai kamiyaan to hai par isamen aajmaana chahie
 Annie Besant herself was in a dilemma on the issue of these reforms and the peaceful non-cooperation movement
 kabhi to vah ise galat kahati or kabhi apane samarthakon ke dabaav ke kaaran thik kahati
 Initially Annie Besant with Tilak said that the Indian public should not accept these reform schemes, it is an insult to him, but later he appealed to accept it
 tilak kaaphi samay tak apane nirnay par adig rahe
 But due to the changed policies of Annie Besant and the moderation of the moderates, he was unable to pull the movement carriage and went to England towards the end of the year, opposing reforms on his own
 vahaan unhone indian anarest ke lekhak chirao par manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kar rakhaa tha
 He stayed in England for several months as a result of the trial of this case
 ani bessent ek shashakt netritv dene main asamarth thi or tilak videsh main the
 As a result, the Home Rule Movement became devoid of leadership
 homerul kii sabase badi uplabdhi yah rahi ki isane bhavi rashtriya aandolan ke liye jujharu yoddha taiyaar kiye
 Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, these militant movements moved forward with the torch of independence
 homerul aandolan ne, uttarapradesh, gujarat, sindh, madras, madhyaprant tathaa baraar jaise anek nae kshetron ko rashtriya aandolan main shaamil kiya
 Thus the Homerul movement did not go in vain
 uskaa bhartiya swatantrata sangram par gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 This movement awakened the sleeping Indians and instilled complete awakening among them

 mansabhakshan kaa swabhaav unke daanton tathaa shaareerik rachana ke kramik vikaas se prakat hota he
 Meat eating is the specialty of animals of this caste, but there were no teeth to cut meat in these early cravings
 inke daanton kii panktiyaan pratham premoller or antim molr ko chhodkar iske cheer faad karanevaale daanton kaa vikaas ho gaya he or ve anya kravyadanton tathaa iske purvaj kitahari praaniyon ke isi prakaar ke daanton ke sadrush tathaa saral nahin rah gaye hai
 Often full grown

 The architecture of these ancient carnivorous carnivores was basically similar to that of ancient insectivores

 According to both of them they originated from the animals of the Maisidi Vyaghra family and from the animals of the dog family

 These small carnivorous creatures lived in small bushes or forests

 Among them were some carnivores, some omnivores and some insectivores
 sada galaa maance khaanevaale in kravyadanton main se kuch kaa mastishk bahut hi chote aakaar kaa tha or unki samajhadaari bhi nimnatam avasthaa main thi
 Lack of understanding may be one of the reasons for this category being quickly destroyed

 They are also referred to as Masonicidi, the second caste of Kravadantas
 is jati ke kravyadanton main bade aakaar main viksit hone kaa bhi abhas prathit hota he
 Now the specialty is seen in the composition of their teeth
 inke daant cheerfaad ke upyukt nahin hote the, parantu inke dadh ke daanton main ek vishesh prakaar ke kund dikhaai padate hai, jinaki sahaayta se is upvarg ke praani apane shikaar tathaa unki haddiyon ko bahut saralata se todate or chabate the
 Their feet were like wolves, with fingers far apart and nails clipped
 inamen aajkal ke lakadabagghon kii bhanti panje nahin the, varan chote-chote khur the
 The importance of these cations of the Masonicidi subclass is due to their specific size
 mongolia kaa antim acreodi kravyadanton main sabase dderghaayu tha
 Its skull was more than three feet long
 kravyadanton kii teesri jati he
 His specialty is tearing teeth

 His anatomy was particularly favorable for this work

 The only difference between the crystals of these two branches was that the first molar of the upper part of the first class and the second molar tooth of the lower part were now completely cut
 isi prakaar duusari shrenee ke kravyadanton main upree bhaag ke duusare molr or nichle jabade main tisare molr kaatane ke kaam aane lage the
 In the Paleocene era, the development of cravings of this caste reached its culmination, but only after that their decline started at a rapid pace
 is jati ke praaniyon ke jivit rahane ke chihn hamen eosin yug main bhi milte hai
 The cravings of this caste lived on the prey of the ancient ancient Shaf class or hoofed creatures

 Among them, the composition of life was of high order, but they were also of small size and were of the same carnivorous nature and size as their ancestors

 All the things that can be fed to cattle such as cow, bull, buffalo, goat, horse etc
 are called fodder or 'cattle feed' or 'animal feed'
 pashu ko 24 ghanton main khilaayaa jane vaala aahaar jisamen uski aavashyaktaaon kii purti hetu bhojya tatv maujuud hon, pashu aahaar kehete hai
 a diet in which all the essential nutrients of the animal are available in the appropriate proportion and quantity is called a balanced diet

 The amount of food in animals depends on its productivity and state of reproduction

 a mixture of pulses and non-pulses fodder may be given in coarse fodder
 dalhani chaare kii maatra aahaar main badhaane se kaaphi had tak dane kii maatra ko kam kiya jaasakata he
 Although the amount of food of the animal is determined according to its body's requirement and function and based on the nutrients found in the available food items, but to save the cattle from the difficulty of the calculation work, the thumb rule Adoption is more convenient
 iske anusaar ham mote taur par vyask dudharu pashu ke aahaar ko teen virgon main baant sakate hai
 This is the amount of food that an animal is given to keep its body healthy
 ise pashu apane sharir ke taapmaana ko uchit seemaa main banaae rakhane, sharir kii aavashyak kriyaayen jaise pachan kriya, parivahan, shwasan, utsarjan, chayapachay aadi ke liye kaam main laata he

25 kilo tathaa sankar gaay, shuddh nasl kii deshi gaay yaa bhens ke liye isaki maatra 2
0 kilo rakhi jaati he
 To feed the animal by this method, it is necessary to mix the grain in the right proportion by mixing the appropriate ingredients
 iske liye pashupaalak swayan nimnlikhit ghatakon ko die hue anupaat main milakar santoshajanak pashu dana bana sakate hai
 Production food is the amount of animal food that is given to the animal for its milk production in addition to the food that is given for sustenance

5 kilo doodh ke utpaadan ke liye jivan nirvaah aahaar ke atiri 1 kilo dana dena chahie jabaki sankar / deshi dudharu gaayon / bhainson ke liye yah maatra prati 2 kilo doodh ke liye di jaati he
 If green fodder is available in sufficient quantity then every 10 kg of good quality green fodder can be reduced by 1 kg of grain

 The animal must be fed clean water at least thrice a day for milk production and sustenance
 pashu kii garbhavastha main use 5wein maheene se atiri aahaar diya jaataa he kyonki is avadhi ke baad garbh main pal rahe bachche kii vruddhi bahut teji ke saath hone lagati he

 isamen sthaneey gaayon ke liye 1
25 kilo tathaa sankar nasl kii gaayon va bhainson ke liye 1
75 kilo atirikt dana diya janaa chahie
 More milking animals should increase the amount of grain they want from the 8th month of pregnancy or 6 weeks before calving for complete development of their milk glands
 is ke liye jebu nasl ke pashuon main 3 kilo tathaa sankar gaayon va bhainson main 4-5 kilo dane kii maatra pashu kii nirvaah aavashyaktaa ke atiri diya janaa chahie
 This allows the animal to produce maximum milk at the next point of its ability

 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai

 unhone saptarshi taramandal main ek badalon se yukt yaa dhundhale kshetra kaa bhi ullekh kiya tha, jo kisi bhi taare ke saath nahin judaa tha
 Unlike the galaxies, the first real nebula was mentioned by the Persian astronomer Abd al-rahman al-sufi in his "situated Star Book"
 unhone andromeeda gallexi ke sthaan par "ek chota badal" dekha tha
 He characterized the Omricran Velorum constellation Punj as a "nebulous star" or obscure star and other obscure objects in Bruchi's cluster

 In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae
 Throughout the century, the number continued to increase, with the compilation of a list of 20 released in 1746 by Jean Philippe de Chasaux
 Nicolas Louis de Lacale listed 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope in 1751–53
 Most of which were previously unknown

 In early 1864, William Huggins investigated the spectra or range of about 70 nebulae
 They found that about a third of them had a wide range of gas inclusions
 baaki main ek satat vistrut shrenee dikhaai di or inhen sitaron kaa ek samooh mana gaya
 In 1912, a third category was added when Vesto Slifer demonstrated that the nebulae around the Meropee star resembled the Pleiades open starfish
 is prakaar niharika taron ke prativimvit prakaash dwaara chamakta he
 Slifer and Edwin Hubble continued to collect a wide range of these from several diffused nebulae and discovered that 29 of these showed emission spectra and 33 had continuous spectra of starlight
 1922 main habal ne ghoshnaa kii ki lagbhag sabhi niharikaayen sitaron se judy hai or unki roshni taron ke prakaash se aati he
 They also discovered that nebulae in the emission spectrum are almost always warmer than B1 or more, whereas nebulae with continuous spectra appear with relatively cold stars

 Dark or dark nebulae are the same as diffuse nebulae, but they cannot be seen by the light emitted or reflected by them
 Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of distant stars or emission nebulae
 haalanki ye niharikaayen prakaash tarangon par alag-alag dikhaai detii hai, par ve sabhi infrared yaa avarakt taragon par utsarjan ke ujjwal strot hai
 This emission mainly comes from the dust inside the nebulae

 These nebulae are emitting nebulae with blurred emission, similar to those of emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 takneekee taur par, yah HII kshetra hai kyonki adhiktar hydrogen ynit hoga
 However, planetary nebulae are more dense and more solid than emission nebulae found in star-forming regions

 PH or ph is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution
 ise draveebhoot hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi ke sah-laghuganak ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 The activity coefficients of hydrogen ions cannot be measured experimentally, so they are based on theoretical calculations
 ph scale, koi sunishchit scale nahin he; iskaa sambandh maanak vilyan ke ek set ke saath hota he jiske ph kaa akalan antarrashtriya sanvida ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The concept of ph was first introduced in 1909 by the Danish chemist Sören Peder Lauritz Sørensen of the Carlsberg Laboratory
 yah abhi bhi agyaat he ki p kii sateek paribhaasha kya he
 Some references suggest that p signifies "power" and others refer to it as the German word "potenz", and still others refer to it as "potential"
 jens norbi ne 2000 main ek patr prakashit kiya jisamen usne tark diya ki p, ek sthiraank he or "rinatmak laghuganak" kaa pratik he; jiskaa prayog anya kaaryon main bhi kiya jaataa he
 h is a symbol of hydrogen
 sorensen ne suvidha ke liye "PH" sanket kaa suzav diya jo "power of hydrogen" kaa pratik he jisamen solution, p main hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ke sah-laghuganak kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Although this definition has been superseded
 yadi ek electrode ko gyaat hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ke solution ke saath anshakit kiya jaataa he to p ko mapa ja saktaa he
 Pure water is considered neutral

 Solutions with a ph less than 7 are called acidic and solutions with a ph greater than 7 are called alkaline or alkaline
 chikitsa shaastra, jeev vigyaan, rasayan shaastra, khaadya vigyaan, paryaavaran vigyaan, samudr vigyaan or kai anya anuprayogon main ph ke maapan kaa bahut mahatv he
 ph is defined as the decimal logarithm subtraction of the activity of hydrogen ion in an aqueous solution
 isaki laghuganakeey prakruti kii visheshta ke kaaran, ph, ek ayamarahit quantity he
 Where a h is the activity of hydrogen ions
 is paribhaasha kaa kaaran yah he ki a H, kisi ekal aayan kaa ek gun he jise keval ek aayan-chaynaatmak electrode kii sahaayta se prayogtmak rup se mapa ja saktaa he jo nernst sameekaran ke anusaar hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke saath pratikriya karata he
 The ph is usually measured with the help of a composite glass electrode that measures the potential difference or electromotive force, E, between an electrode sensitive to the activity of hydrogen ion and a reference electrode such as a calomel electrode or a silver chloride electrode
 is
 sanyukt glass electrode adarshatah nernst sameekaran kaa anusaran karata he: Where e is a measured potential and e 0 is the standard electrode potential ie the standard state electrode potential with activity also being one
 R, gas sthiraank he; T, kelvin taapmaana he; F, farade sthiraank he or n, hastantarit electrons kii sankhya kaa ek udhaaharan he
 The electrode potential, E, is proportional to the logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion
 yah paribhaasha apane aap main puri tarah se avyaavhaarik he kyonki hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi, sandratha or gatividhi gunank kaa gunanfal hota he
 The coefficient of activity of a single-ion of a hydrogen ion is a quantity that cannot be measured experimentally
 is kathinaayee se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye, electrode ko gyaat gatividhi ke solution ke sambandh main anshakit kar diya jaataa he
 The operational definition of ph is officially defined by the International Standard ISO 31-8 as follows: For solution X, the galvanic cell's electromotive force, EX is measured | kcl kaa sandrit solution || solution x | H2 | Pt or tab ek galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e s ko bhi mapa jaataa he jo gyaat maanak ph ke solution s ke dwaara agyaat ph ke solution X, ph kii pratisthapana dwaara uparyukt se bhinn hota he
 Then x has a ph of solution x ke ph or maanak solution ke ph ke bich kaa antar keval do maape gaye potential ke bich ke antar par nirbhar karata he
 Thus, ph is obtained from a potential measured with an electrode calibrated against one or more ph standards; a ph meter setting is adjusted such that the reading of the meter of the standard solution is equal to the ph value
 maanak solution s ke ek range ke ph maanon ko, aage kii vistrut jaankaree ke saath, IUPAC kii anushansa main darshaya gaya he
 Standard solutions are often described as standard buffer solutions
 vyavhaar main, vaastavik electrode main nernst ke niyam kii adarshata se chote-chote vichlan ke liye anumati dene ke liye do yaa do se adhik maanak bafer kaa prayog karnaa behatar hota he
 Note that since temperature is found in the defining equations, the ph of the solution is temperature-based
 bahut kam ph maanon, jaise kuch bahut amleey khadaan ke jalon ke maapan ke liye vishesh prakriyaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such cases the calibration of the electrode can be done with a concentrated sulfuric acid standard solution whose ph values can be calculated using Pitzer parameters to calculate activity coefficients
 ph, ek amlata ke function kaa udhaaharan he
 The concentration of hydrogen ion can be measured in aqueous solvents, but this results in a different acidity function because the standard state of aqueous solvent is different from the standard state of water
 superacids, ajaleey amlon kaa ek varg he jiske liye hamet amlata ke function, h 0 ko viksit kiya gaya he
 This was Sorensen's original definition superseded in favor of ph
 haalanki, hydrogen yanon kii sandratha ko pratyaksh rup se maapna sambhav he, yadi hydrogen ke aayan kii sandratha ke sandarbh main electrode ko anshakit kiya jaataa he
 One way to do this, which has been used on a large scale, is to measure the solution of known concentrations of a strong acid with a solution of known concentrations of strong alkali in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte
 chunki acid or kshar kii sandratha gyaat hoti he isliye hydrogen yanon kii sandratha kii gananaa karnaa aasaan hota he taaki maape gaye potential ko sandratha ke saath sah-sambhddha kiya ja sake
 anshaakan kaa kaary praayah gran plot kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa he
 The calibration generates a slope factor, f and a value for the standard electrode potential, e 0, to form the Nernst equation
 main e ke praayogic maapan se hydrogen aayan sandratha ko praapt karne ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 The slope factor is usually slightly less than one
 0
95 se kam kaa ek slop factor yah darshata he ki electrode sahi dhang se kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during titration
 chunki yah sthir hota he isliye iske maan ko maanak sthiti ko paribhaashit karke ek main sthapit kiya ja saktaa he jo becoground electrolite yukt solution hota he
 Thus, the activity resulting from the use of this process is equated to the numerical value of the concentrations
 p or ph ke bich kaa antar bahut kam hota he
 It has been said that ph = p + 0
04
 Unfortunately, it is very common to use the noun "ph" for both types of measurements
 poh ko kabhi-kabhi kshariyata yaa hydroxide yanon, OH− kii sandratha ke ek maap ke rup main prayukt hota he
 poh cannot be measured independently but is derived from ph
 jal main hydroxide yanon kii sandratha, Is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions where KW is the constant of self-ionization of water
 nimna sah-laghuganak ko liya jaataa he So, at room temperature poh ≈ 14 - ph
 However, in other circumstances such as measurement of soil alkalinity, this relationship is not fully valid
 shuddh jal lagbhag 7 ph hota he; sateek maan, taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 When an acid is dissolved in water, the ph will be less than 7 and when an alkali or an alkali solution is made in water, the ph will be greater than 7
 The ph of a solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at 1 mol dm − 3 concentration is 0
 1 mol dm−3 sandratha par sodium hydroxide jaise kisi strong kshar ke solution kaa ph, 14 hota he
 Thus, the measured ph values will mostly be within 0 to 14
 Since ph is a logarithmic scale, a ph unit difference is equal to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration
 chunki glass electrode, gatividhi kii pratikriya karata he isliye electrode ko kisi aise madhyam main anshakit kiya janaa chahie jo kisi jaanch kiye ja rahe madhyam ke samaan hota he
 For example, if one wants to measure the ph of a sample of seawater, the electrode must be calibrated in a solution that has a chemical composition similar to that of seawater, which is detailed below
 ek ph indicater kaa prayog karke ph ke ek lagbhag maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 a ph indicator is a substrate that changes the color surrounding a particular ph value
 yah ek wyk acid yaa wyk base he or rang parivartan yaa to 1 ph ikai ke aas-paas amla pruthakkaran sthiraank main yaa pk a maan main, donon main se kisi ek taraf hota he
 For example, naturally occurring litmus turns red in acidic solution and blue in alkaline solution
 universal indicater main indicatoron kaa ek mishran is prakaar se hota he ki lagbhag ph 2 se ph 10 tak ek satat rang parivartan hota rahata he
 a universal indicator letter is a general letter that includes a universal indicator
 jis solution kaa ph, 7 hota he use neutral kaha jaataa he arthath yah na to acidic he or na hi basic 
 jal, ek swa-ynikaran prakriya ke adheen he
 The value of the dissociation constant, KW, is about 10−14, so the neutral solution of the salt contains both hydrogen ion concentrations and hydroxide ion concentrations of about 10−7 mol dm − 3
 taapmaana main vruddhi hone par shuddh jal kaa ph ghatane lagata he
 For example, the ph of pure water at 50 ° c is 6
55
 dhyaan den, haalanki, hawa ke sampark main aane vaala jal thodaa-thodaa acidic hota he
 The reason for this is that water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which then slowly transforms into carbonic acid, which liberates the hydrogen ion and separates it: ek strong acid ke maamle main, sampurna pruthakkaran hota he isliye ph saadharantah acid sandratha ke laghuganak ke ghataav ke baraabar hota he
 For example, a 0
01 molar solution of hydrochloric acid has a ph, −log i
e
 ph = 2
 ek wyk acid ke solution ke ph kii gananaa, ICE teble ke madhyam se kii ja sakati he
 For acids with a value greater than 2 pk a, jahaan c0, acid kii sandratha he
 This is equivalent to Burrows' week acid ph equation ek adhik saamaanya vidhi is prakaar he

 From the first equation duusare sameekaran main is abhivyakti ke pratisthaapan se praapt hota he This explains the quadratic equation in hydrogen ion concentration
 is sameekaran ke solution se or isse ph bhi praapt hota he
 This method can also be used for polyprotic acids
 udhaaharan ke liye, dyprotic acid oxalik acid ke liye, oksalet aayan ke liye A2− likhaa jaataa he, Where β1 and β2 are cumulative protonation constants
 pehle sameekaran se duusare sameekaran main pratisthapit karne kii isi prakriya ke baad, main ek ghan sameekaran praapt hota he
 In general, the degree of the equation is one more than the number of ionizable protons

 The kellag-brienne Agreement was an international agreement to settle mutual disputes peacefully, which was signed in Paris on 27 August 1928 by representatives of 15 countries
 is samjhaute ke purv, antarrashtriya vidhi main, yuddh vidhanat: grahya saadhan tha, jiske dwaara raashtra apane vaastavik yaa kaalpanik adhikaron kii raksha karte the
 An attempt to limit this right was made by the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, and the Bryan Treaties of 1914
 1924 main sweekrut jineva protocal ke duusare anuchhed main yah kiya gaya ki un avasthaaon ko chhodkar jo usamen pariganit thim, kisi bhi avasthaa main yuddh kaa aashray na liya jaae
 In September 1927, the League of Nations gathering, at its eighth meeting, accepted Poland's proposal that: sabhi abhidhaavnatmak yudhon kaa nishedh hona chahie
 All kinds of disputes, which arise between countries, should be resolved by peaceful measures
 farvari, san 1928 main chhathi pan-american kanference ne ek prastaav karte hue ghoshit kiya ki prathamakraman manushya maatr ke prati ek aparaadh he, prayek prathamakraman pratishiddh or is kaaran nishiddh he
 These ideas and efforts were given the form of the kellag-briani Pact
 professor shatwel ke suzav par france ke videsh- sachiv briyaan ne america ke sachiv kelaag ke bich is sambandh main patrachaar aarambh kiya or is patrachaar ke falswaroop yah sandhipatr sweekaar kiya gaya
 For this reason, it is called the kellag-brians or Paris Agreement
 is samjhaute main ek prakkathan tathaa do mukhya anuchhed hai
 In this it is announced- ucch sanvidit paksh, apane apane deshavaasiyon kii ore se gambhirthapurvak ghoshit karte hai ki ve antarrashtriya vivaadon ko sulajhane main, yuddh kaa aashray lenaa tiraskrit samajhate hai or ek duusare se sambandhit vishyon main rashtriya niti ke saadhan ke rup main uskaa parityag karte hai
 Highly disposed parties agree that the resolution of all disputes or disputes, whether of any kind or for any reason, which arise between them, should be settled only by peaceful means
 is prakaar kaha jaataa he ki yah samjhauta yuddh kaa tyaag karne kii ek saarvajanik sandhi he
 Later, this treaty became merely a verbal declaration
 isapar hastakshar karanevaale deshon ne sheeghra iskaa ulanghan kiya
 In 1929, Russia wielded massive force against China, in 1931–32 Japan against Manchuria, and in 1931 Peru against Colombia, although they did not formally declare war
 san 1935 main italy ne abisinia ke viruddh, 1937 main japan ne china ke viruddh or 1939 main rus ne finland ke viruddh spasht rup se yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii
 Thus, although this agreement began to be violated soon, it cannot be said that its legal significance has declined

he, rashtron ke rashtramandal ke un 16 saarvbhaumik rashtron ko kaha jaataa he, jinpar ek hi shaasha, maharani elizabeth dwi kaa raaj he
 All these countries share the same state, ruler, royal family and succession order
 is vyavastha kii shuruyaat 1931 kii westminster kii sanvidhi ke saath hui thi, jiske dwaara britain ke tatkaaleen dominian, australia, canada, newzealand, irish mukt rajya or newfoundland ko british rashtramandal ke baraabar ke sadsy hone ke saath hi purna yaa purnatmat vaidhik swatantraaa pradaan kii gayi thi
 Since the Second World War, all countries of the British Empire, extended around the world, were granted independence as a Dominion
 jiname se kuch rajyon ne purnatah swadhin hone ke baavjood rajtantr ke prati apni vafadaari ko barqaraar rakhaa, jabaki kuch rajyon ne british rajtantr ko nammaatr pramukh maanane se inkaar kar swayan ko ganatantric rajya ghoshit kar diya
 Today, there are a total of 16 states in the world outside which identify themselves as a homeland of Queen Elizabeth II
 angrezi bhashaa main british samprabhu ke adheen in rajyon ko aam taur par riyalm ke naam se janaa jaataa he, joki francisi shabd royum se liya gaya he, realm yani ek aisa rajya, kshetra yaa pradesh, jisapar ek raja / rani raaj karti he
 It is necessary to know here that "realm" is not a legal or legal term in the official terminology of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or any Commonwealth Territory, that is, there is no legal definition of "realm"
 atah aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he kii british samprabhu ke adheen aanevaale in rajyon ko kisi vishesh naam se sambodhit kiya jaae, naahin "realm" shabd, ek rajya ke kisi vishesh darje ko paribhaashit karata he
 However, since the 1950s, the term "realm" has been used in authoritative documents to distinguish states under the British sovereign's rule from other member states of the Commonwealth, even the Queen Elizabeth's coronation This word was also used in the declaration of
 in rajyon ko realm isiilie kaha jaataa he, kyonki ek hi shaasha kii adheen hone ke baavjood ye saare rajya, purnatah saarvbhaumik hai, or ek-dusre se purnah swatantra hai, atah yah 16 desh, ek rajnatik ikai kaa hissaa nahin he, balki 16 alag-alag rajya hai
 Because realm is not a legal word, therefore no official translation of it is also present
 atah in pradeshon kaa bodh karne hetu, kisi raja ke adheen bhoomi kaa bodh karaane vaale kisi bhi shabd kaa upyog kiya jaasakata he
 Ordinarily, words like prajbhoomi, pradesh, and paribhumi are used, besides these, the terms mandal and rajbhumi can also be used
 vartmaan sthitinusaar, varsh 1992 se, vishwa main kul 16 rashtramandal prajabhumiyaan hai, jinka kul kshetrafal 1,87,00,000 varg kilometre he, or aabaadi 14,30,00,000 he
 Of which 6 are the most populated countries: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Jamaica
 rajmukut athwa da crown kii vyavastha ek vishesh raajnneetik sankalpana he, jisaki britain tathaa anya rashtramandal pradeshon ke vidhishastra tathaa rajatantric vyavastha main atimahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This thinking was developed during the feudalistic period in the Kingdom of England to address literal crowns and national estates by dividing them from the sovereign and his / her personal property
 is soch ke anusaar rajmukut ko prashasan ke samast angon tathaa har aayam main rajya tathaa shashan ke pratik ke rup main dekha jaataa he, tathaa british samprabhu ko rajmukut ke satat avatar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, in Britain and the Commonwealth territories, this terminology is also used as an epithet for governance or government, or it may be said directly that this is another way of addressing the monarchy itself
 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he
 Therefore, in this context the word should not be confused with the actual crown of any royal dress
 ek santhaan ke rup main, rajmukut, britain kii raajnneetikvyavastha kaa sabase purana kaaryshil santhaan he
 The concept of Rajmukut in each Commonwealth region is the same, but divided legal concepts
 atah rashtramandaleey vidhi main, ek adhikarashetra ko dusre se alag karne ke liye nyaayik dastavezon main, " par adhikaar dhari mukut


" udhaaharan: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom


" yaa '"la Couronne du chef du Québec" iske alaava The Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, ityadi, or kyonki, canda or australia sangheey raashtra hai, atah prayek canadian praant or australian rajya "par adhikaar dhari rajmukut" bhi hai
 The rights of the crown are exercised either by the superintendent himself or by his representative, on the advice of the ministers or officials concerned
 rashtramandal pradeshon ke bich kaa sambandh is prakaar kaa he kii uttaradhikaar ko anushaasit karne vaale kisi bhi bidhan kaa saare deshon kii ekamat sweekruti aavashyak he
 This obligation was imposed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931
 singhasana par uttaradhikaar, vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhion dwaara anushaasit he, jinamein bill of ritis, 1689, act of setlement, 1701 or act of union, 1707 shaamil hai
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 uttaradhikaar sambandhit niyam keval sansadeey adhinium dwaara parivartit kiye ja sakate hai, singhasana kaa koi uttaradhikari, swechha se apana uttaradhikaar tyaag nahin kar saktaa he
 After sitting on the throne, a person rules till his death
 itihaas main ekmaatr swachhik padatyag, 1936 main edward ashtum ne kiya tha, jise sansad ke vishesh adhinium dwaara vaid qaraara gaya tha
 The last time a ruler was involuntarily expelled was James VII and II in 1688 who were expelled at the time of the Glorious Revolution
 act of setlement, 1701, uttaradhikaar ko sofia of hanover, james pratham kii ek potee, ke vaidhik protestant vanshajon tak simit karata he
 Therefore, no Catholic member of the royal family can ever authorize the throne
 ek shaasi shaasha ke nidhan par swayamev hi, rajpth, uske asann vaaris ke paas chalaa jaataa he, atah saidhantik rup se, singhasana ek kshan ke liye bhi khali nahin rahata he
 And the succession is publicly declared by the succession council
 atah angreji parampara ke anusaar shaasha ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid hone ke liye rajbhishek hona aavashyak nahin he
 So the coronation is usually a few months after the succession
 nae shaasha ke rajbhishek kii parampara westminster aibe main cantarbari ke archbishap dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 atah uttaradhikari ke ling tathaa dharm kaa uttaradhikaar par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he
 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories
 1701 ke act of setlement ke vidhaanon ke anusaar, james pratham kii potee, hanover kii electress, sofia, ke "vaid" protostant vanshaj hi singhasana ko uttaradhikrut karne ke liye sakasham hai
 That is, only legitimate children of the royal family's dynasty hold succession over Singhasan, and none of the illegitimate children, and their descendants, have any right over Singhasan
 is sandarbh main, royal marejez act, 1772 ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar shahi parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko vivaah karne hetu samprabhu kii sweekruti lenaa aavashyak he, or samprabhu ke sweekruti ke bina kiye gaye kisi bhi vivaah ko "avaidh" qaraar diya jayega, tathaa vah vyakti or uske santan singhasana par adhikaar se vanchit ho jaayenge
 Some changes were made to the provisions of this Act by the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act
 is adhinium ke anusaar, uttaradhikaar kram ke pehle chah sadasyon ko vivaah karne hetu samprabhi kii ijazat lenaa aavashyak he, anyathaa us vyakti tathaa us vivaah se hue saare santan or unke vanshajon ko uttaradhikaar kram se vanchit maan liya jayega
 But any such marriage cannot be declared illegal in any way
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 baharhaal, aam taur par un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 The royal family, based on this criteria, included Adhirat, his / her companions, the widow / widower of the former sovereign, the offspring of the eldest son of the prince of Wales, and the siblings or widows of the sons of the former ruler and grandson of his male line
 Will be vibhinn rashtramandal pradeshon ke sandarbh main, isi vishesh samooh ke liye bhinn shabdaawalee kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke taur par, australia main is samooh ko australian rajpariwaar or canda main canadian rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he
 By the colonial expansion of Britain during the 18th and 19th centuries, Britain occupied many other regions of the world
 jinamein se adhiktar deshon ne madhya 20veen sadi tak britain se swatantraaa hasil kar lee
 Although all those countries rejected the suzerainty of the government of the United Kingdom, many of them recognized the British ruler as their suzerainty
 in deshon ko rashtramandal pradesh yaa rashtramandal prajabhumi kaha jaataa he
 At present, the United Kingdom is not only the United Kingdom, but in addition there are a total of 15 other nations
 haalanki in rashtron main bhi unhen lagbhag saamaan pad va adhikaar praapt he jaisaa kii britain main, parantu un deshon main, unka koi vaastavik raajnneetik yaa paaramparik karttavya nahin he, shaasha ke lagbhag saare karttavya unke pratnidhi ke rup main us desh ke maharajyapal puraa karte hai
 The Government of Britain has no role or interference in the work of the governments of the Commonwealth territories
 britain ke alaava rashtramandal prajabhumi main: antigua or barbuda, australia, bahama, barbados, belize, grenada, jamaica, canada, newjiland, papua new gini, solomon dweep, saint loosia, saint kits or nevis, saint vincent or grenadins or tuvaalu jaise desh shaamil hai
 Formerly all the nations of the Commonwealth of Nations used to be part of the Commonwealth of Nations, but in 1950 India declared itself a republic after independence, and also abolished the sovereignty of the British monarchy as its head of state
 parantu bharat ne rashtramandal kii sadsyta barqaraar raakhi
 Since then, in Commonwealth countries, the British sovereign is also given the position of "head of the Commonwealth", which is the nominal head of the organization of the Commonwealth
 is pad kaa koi rajnatik arth nahin he
 Balaram Ji Das Tandon was the Governor of Chhattisgarh in present-day India
 guru ghasidas gram girudpuri tahsil balaudabazar jila raipur main pita mahangudas ji evam mata amarautin ke yahan avatarit huye the guruuji satnam satnam dharm jise aam bol chaal main satnami dharm ke pravartak kaha jaataa he, guruuji bhandarpuri ko apana dharmik sthal ke rup main sant samaaj ko pramanit satya ke shakti ke saath diye vahaan guruuji ke vanshaj aaj bhi nivasarat he
 He gave a message of human-human equality by ending socio-economic disparity, exploitation and caste discrimination of his time
 san 1672 main vartmaan haryana ke narnaul naamak sthaan par saadh birabhan or jogidaas naamak do bhaaiyon ne satnami saadh mat kaa prachaar kiya tha
 Followers of the Satnami Sadhism believed in the principle of not bowing down to any human
 ve sammaan karte the lekin kisi ke saamne jhuk kar nahin
 Once a farmer did not bow down to the prince of the then Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, he considered it his insult and attacked him with sticks, in response to which Satnami Sadh also beat him with sticks
 yah vivaad yaheen khatm na hokar tool pakadtey gaya or dhire dhire mughal badshaah aurangzeb tak pahunch gaya ki satnamiyon ne baghawat kar di he
 It was here that the historic war of Aurangzev and Satnamis took place
 jiskaa netritv satnami saadh birabhan or saadh jogidaas ne kiya tha
 The war lasted for several days in which the imperial army was going on beating the unarmed Satnami group
 shahi fouj main ye baat bhi fail gai ki satnami samooh koi jaadu tona karke shahi fouj ko haraa rahe hai
 For this, Aurangzeb also got his soldiers to write talism written verses of Quran, but in spite of this there was no difference
 lekin unhen ye pataa nahin tha ki satnami saadhon ke paas aadhyatmik shakti ke kaaran yah sthiti thi
 Since the time of Satnami Sadhas' tenacity was over and they attained Veeragati by surrendering to the Guru
 jin logon kaa tap puraa nahin hua tha ve apni jaan bachaa kar alag alag dishaao main bhaag nikle the
 In which there was also a family of Ghasidas who had reached the present Chhattisgarh along the banks of the Mahanadi
 jahaan par sant ghasidas ji kaa janm hua auki vahaan par unhone satnam panth kaa prachaar tathaa prasar kiya
 Guru Ghasidas was born in 1756 in Girodpuri in Raipur district into a poor and ordinary family
 unhone hindu dharm kii kuritiyon par kutharaghaat kiya

 Well-designed diversions are necessary to change the direction or slope of roads, especially on roads which are likely to drive fast
 mulat: mode do prakaar ke hote hai: kshaitij mode tathaa urdhwadhar mode
 It is impossible for a speeding vehicle on a main road to make a complete change in horizontal direction, unless it stops at all

 The design of horizontal turns is dependent on the speed for which the road is made and the type of surface it is built on

 The width of the sphere at the bend should also be increased, as shown in the table above
 sabhi mode adhiktam vyavhaarya trigya vaale hone chahie
 Whenever a vehicle moving fast on the straight section of the road enters the turn, the passengers feel some discomfort due to the sudden action of the centrifugal force
 sankrami mond dwaara sidhe bhaag or vruteey mode ke bich saral parivartan sunishchit ho jaataa he, jisase sadak ke prayoktaaon ko disha parivartan main asuvidha kii anubhuti nahin hoti
 The normal form of contagious turn in roads is spiral
 sadak kii lambaai main jahaan kahin bhi dhaal badalati he, dhaalon ke kataan par upyukt urdhwadhar mode dekar golai kar deni chahie
 In these modes, the gradient changes easily, so that the passengers in the fast moving train do not feel discomfort and the road continues to be visible
 urdhwadhar modon ke aakalpan main kalpit chaal, aage kitni dur tak dikhaai dena aavashyak he or kataan par kii dhaal, in teen baton par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Standing turns are often parabolic in shape
 jab dhaalon ke kataan par chotii banati he, tab mode uttal or jab kataan par ghati banati he, tab ve avatal hote hai
