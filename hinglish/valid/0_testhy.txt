 Rivers and mountains, plants and animals, mata amritanandmayi devi ek hindu aadhyatmik netri va guru hai, jinhen unke anuyaayi sant ke rup main sammaan dete hai or "ammaa ", "ammachi" yaa "maa" ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 He is widely respected for his humanitarian activities
 kabhi-kabhi unki ore "prem se gale lagane vaali sant" ke naam se bhi sanket kiya jaataa he
 According to Swami Amritasvarupanand Puri, the vice-president of Mata Amritanandamayi Math, “it is as natural for Amma to overcome the grief of others as it is to wipe the tears of her eyes
 dusron kii khushi main hi ammaa kii khushi he
 Amma considers her safety only while protecting others
 dusron ke vishram main hi ammaa kaa vishram he
 This is Amma's dream
 or yahi vah sapana he jiske liye maa ne apana jivan maanavtaa ke jaagran ke prati samarpit kar diya he
 " mata amritanandmayi devi kaa janm paryakadvu ke chote se gaanv alppad panchayat, jila kolum, kerala main 1953 main sudhamani idmannel ke rup main hua tha
 At the age of 9, she stopped going to school and she took full time to look after her younger siblings and do domestic work
 in kaaryon ke ek hisse ke rup main sudhamani idmannel apane parivaar kii gaayon or bakriyon ke liye apane padosiyon se bachaa hua bhojan ekatra karti thim
 Amma says that in those days she was going through extreme poverty due to extreme poverty and suffering of other people
 ve apane ghar se in logon ke liye vastra or khaanaa laati thim
 His family, which was not rich, used to scold and punish him for this
 ammaa kabhi kabhi achaanak hi logon ko dukh se raahat pahunchane ke liye unhen gale se laga leti thim
 While at that time a 14-year-old girl was not allowed to touch anyone, especially men
 lekin apane mata-pita se vipareet pratikriyaayein milane ke baavjood bhi ammaa aisa hi karti raheen
 Talking about embracing others, Amma said, "I do not see whether she is a woman or a man
 i do not see anyone as different from myself
 i have a constant love stream flowing towards all the creations of the world
" yah meraa janmajaat swabhaav he
 a physician's duty is to treat patients
 "isi prakaar meraa kartavya un logon ko santvanaa dena he jo ksht main hai
 " unke mata-pita dwaara unke vivaah ke anekon prayaason ke baavjood bhi ammaa ne sabhi nivedakon ko asweekaar kar diya
 In 1981, when a number of inquisitive travelers came and lived in Amma's property to become disciples of her parents, a world-class organization, Mata Amritanandamayi Math was established
 ammaa is math kii adhyaksh thim
 Today Mata Amritanandamayi Math is engaged in many spiritual and charitable activities
 1987 main, apane shraddhaluon ke anurodh par, ammaa vishwa ke sabhi deshon main kaarykram yojit karne lageen
 tab se ve prativarsh aisa karti hai
 Countries where Amma's events have been held include: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Dubai, England, Finland, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritius, Reunion, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States

 sanskrit main darshan kaa arth hota he 'dekhnaa'
 hindu paaramparik pratha main yah pavitra vyakti yaa vastu ko dekhne kii ore sanket karata he
 Ideally, it resembles the vision of a holy person or object in the image of a god in a temple
 kisi devtaa kii chhavi dekhne main darshannkarta apni ankhon ke madhyam se us devtaa kii shaktiyon ko grahan karte hai
 Therefore, in philosophy, the viewer has the ability to provide good luck, well-being and divine influence
 ammaa ke anuyaayi is shabd kaa prayog vishisht rup se prempurvak aalingan kiye jane ke behad mangapurn sanskaar ke liye karte hai
 Amma has been giving darshan in this way since her teens
 yah pratha kis prakaar shuru hui is sambandh main ammaa bataati hai ki, "log yahaan aakar apni samasyaon ke bare main bataaya karte the
 They used to cry and i used to wipe their tears
 jab ve rote-rote meri god main gir jaaya karte the, to mai unhen gale se laga leti thi
 Then the next person also expected me to behave like this
 

or is tarah se yah rivaaz ban gaya
 "amma's organization, Mata Amritanandamayi Math, claims that Amma has embraced more than 29 million people of this world with her neck
 · When in 2002, he was asked what he thought was his hug to help the sick of the world
 Amma said, "I don't say that i can solve their problems 100 percent
 Trying to change this world is the same as straightening the crooked tail of a dog
 But people are born from society is
 isliye logon ko prabhavit karne ke dwaara, aap is samaaj main parivartan laa sakate hai or iske dwaara is sansar main parivartan laayaa ja saktaa he
 You can make changes, but you cannot change it completely
 The war going on in each person's brain is responsible for the actual wars
 isliye yadi aap logon ko sparsh kar sakate hai, to ap is vishwa ko bhi sparsh kar sakate hai
 " ammaa kaa yah darshan hi unke jivan kaa centre he kyonki 1970 ke uttarardh se vah lagbhag pratidin hi logon se milti hai
 Along with this, the number of people coming to get Amma's blessing is increasing continuously, sometimes it happens that she keeps on giving darshan continuously for 20 hours
 2004 kii ek pustak from ammaa'za heart, main ankit samvaad main ammaa kahati hai; "jab tak mere ye haath zaraa bhi hill paane or mere paas aane vaale logon tak pahunch paane main samarth rahenge or jab tak mujhamen rote hue vyakti ke kandhe par apana haath rakhane or par prem se haath pherane tathaa unke aansu ponchney kii shakti rahegi, tab tak yah ammaa darshan detii rahegi
 is nashwar sansar kaa ant hone tak, logon par prem se haath pherana, unhen santvanaa dena or unke aansu ponchna, yahi ammaa kii ichha he
 " pustak da timeles path, main ammaa ke ek varisht shishy, swami ramakrishnananda puri likhte hai: "ammaa dwaara man main baithaaya gaya paath thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa ki hamaare vedon main diya gaya he or unke baad ke paaramparik dharmik granthon main sankshep main doharaaya gaya he jaise bhagavad gita

 in teenon kii sahaayta se hi pakshi unchaaiyon tak pahunch saktaa he
 "she sees various prayers and spiritual conventions of all religions as diverse methods for the sole purpose of purification of the brain
 iske saath hi ammaa dhyaan, karm yoga par aadhaarit kriyaaon, paroapkaar or karunaa, dhairya, dayaa, aatm niyantran jaise divine gunon ke vikaas ke mahatv par bhi bal detii hai, ammaa kahati hai ki in gunon kaa abhyaas hamaare mashtishk ko parishkrut karata he, ise antim satya ko aatmsaat karne ke yogya banaata he: antim satya yah he ki hamaara astitv is sharir or mashtishk kii seemaa main simit nahin hai apitu yah ek aanandamay chetana he jo is brahmand ke advait adhbstar ke rup main kaary karti he
 This idea is called Amma Jivanmukti
 ammaa kahati hai, "jeevanmukti koi aisi avasthaa nahin he jise mrityu ke baad praapt kiya jaye or naa hi aapako iskaa anubhav yaa prapti kisi duusare sansar main hogi
 yah purna chetana or samavritti kii ek avasthaa he jiskaa anubhav is jivit sharir ko dhaaran kiye hue hi isi sansar main abhi hi kiya ja saktaa he
 After experiencing this highest truth by integrating with one's self, such a blissful self does not need to be born again
 She integrates with infinite consciousness
 " Amma's worldwide charitable mission includes 100,000 homes for the homeless, 3 orphanage shelters, and relief-and-rehabilitation, free medical care, widows and disabled persons faced with disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
 Pensions, environmental protection groups, renovation of slums, care centers for the aged and free clothing and food for the poor, etc

 jab 2004 main unase yah poocha gaya ki unke dharmarth mishan kaa vikaas kaisaa chal rahaa he to ammaa ne kaha, "jahaan tak gatividhiyon kii baat he yah kisi yojana par aadhaarit nahin hai

' The spirit of this mantra has been made the medium of karma
 " Most of the work is done by volunteers as a spiritual practice
 "yah ammaa kii ichha he ki unke sabhi bachche is vishwa main prem or shanti ke prasar ke liye apana jivan samarpit kar den
 ammaa kahati hai "garibon tathaa peediton ke liye sachhee karunaa hi ishwar ke prati sachcha prem or bhakthi he
 "" My children feed them who are hungry, help the poor, comfort the miserable, bring relief to the afflicted and are generous to all
 " Amma is also very famous for her devotional music

 He has composed dozens of hymns and molded them according to traditional ragas
 bhakthi geeton ko aadhyatmik abhyaas ke rup main gaaye jane ke sambandh main ammaa kahati hai, "yadi bhajanon ko ekaagratha ke saath gaya jaye to yah gayak, shrota or prakruti ke liye laabhprad hota he
 Later when the audience contemplates the hymn, they try to conform to the recited texts in the hymns
 " ammaa kahati hai ki aaj ke sansar main, praayah logon ke liye dhyaan ke dauraan ekagra hona kathin ho jaataa he, lekin bhakthi gayan ke dwaara yah ekaagratha saralata se praapt kii ja sakati he

 The discovery, which is very similar to these early fossil marks, has its origins in the present-day giant size single-organism Protista organism Gromia sphaerica, doubting their interpretation as evidence of early animal development
 lambey arase pehle se spanj ko anya praarambhik jantuon se bhinn mana jaataa tha
 As noted above, the complex organization found in most other associations is not found in them, their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into separate tissues
 spanj tane rahit hote hai or aam taur par inke chhidron ke madhyam se jal khinch kar bhojan praapt karte hai
 Archaeocyatha, which have a fused skeleton, may represent a sponge or a different association
 haalaanki, 2008 main 21 vanshon main 150 jeenon kaa ek faillo jinomik adhyayan bataata he ki yah tinophora yaa comb jelly he jo kam se kam un 21 sanghon main jantuo kaa aadhaar banaati he
 The authors believe that sponges — or at least the sponges they have discovered — are not so primitive, but can instead be simplified secondary
 anya sangho main, tinophora or nideria, jinamein samudri anemon, coral or jelifish shaamil hai, trigyat samamit hote hai, inamen ek hi chhidr se yukt pachan kaksh hota he, jo mukh or guda donon kaa kaam karata he
 Both have distinctly differentiated tissues, but are not organized into organs
 inamen keval do mukhya janan str hote hai, bahya tvak str or antah tvak str, jinke bich main keval koshikaayen bikhri hoti hai
 That is why these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
 chote placosoa samaan hai, lekin un main ek sthaayee pachan kaksh nahin hota he
 The remaining animals form a federal group called the bilateria
 adhiktam bhaag ke liye, ve dwiparshv samamit hote hai or aksar ek vishishtikrut sir hota he jo khaadya angon or samvedi angon se yukt hota he
 The body is tripleblastic, that is, all three reproductive layers are fully developed and tissues form differentiated organs
 pachan kaksh main do chhidr hote hai, ek mukh or ek guda, saath hi ek aantarik deh guha bhi hoti he jo ceylom yaa abhaasi deh guha bhi kehalaati he
 There are exceptions to each of these traits, however - adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and have very simplified physiological structures in typical parasitic animals

 Deuterostomes differ in many ways from other bilateria, protostomes
 donon hi maamalon main ek puraa pachan path paaya jaataa he
 However, in the protostome, the initial pore develops in the mouth and the anus develops separately
 duterostome main yah ulat he
 In most protostomes, cells normally fill in the inner part of the gastrula and form the middle reproductive level, this is called Schizosillus development, but in the deuterostome it is formed by the intracellular level of innervation, known as entrosylic pouching
 duterostome main adhar ke bajaay prishthiya tantrika rajju hota he or unke bhrun main bhinn prakaar kaa vidalan hota he
 All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are distinctly federal levels
 duterostome ke pramukh sangh hai, ekainodermanta or cordeta
 The former is radially symmetric and is particularly marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers

 Although they are not currently found predominantly, significant fossil evidence relates to them
 chetognetha yaa tir krimi bhi duterostome ho sakate hai, lekin adhik haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan protostome ke saath inke saannnidhya ko darshaate hai
 Ecdysozoa are protostomes, which have been named on the basis of a characteristic characteristic of growth by moulting or release

 It is generally considered convergent evolution, as there are many morphological and genetic differences between the two associations

 Theoretically it is possible that the two singletons are identical if all the 23 chromosomes of both mother and father gametes match exactly from one birth to the next
 While this is statistically impossible to do under natural conditions, someday a controlled contact may be possible

 Due to the widespread use of fertility drugs, which some people call an "epidemic of multiple births", is spreading
 2001 main, america main pehali baar, judawaan bacchon kii janm dar sabhi janmon se 3% adhik ho gai
 Nevertheless, the worldwide birth rate of monozygotic twins remains 1 in 333
 nigeria ke savana kshetra main rahane vaali 5750 hausa mahilaon par hue adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki vahaan prayek 1000 janmon main 40 judawaan or 2 triplate the

 The incidence of multiple births was associated with maternal age but was not related to climate or the spread of malaria
 ekayugmanaj bacchon ke rogpravanta kaarak agyaat hai
 There is a slight chance of dizygotic twin pregnancies when the following factors are present in a woman: kuch prajnan upachaar ke daur se guzarane vaali mahilaon main dviyugmanaj ekaadhik janmon kii adhik sambhaavna ho sakati he
 This can depend on what type of fertility treatment has been done

 Some other treatments, such as clomid medication, can cause a woman to lay multiple eggs, increasing the likelihood of multiple babies being born
 hes main 15 saal tak saamaanya prasav se janme 8220 judawaan bacchon par hue ek german adhyayan ke anusaar ausat prasav samay interval 13

 The delivery interval between twins was measured as follows: adhyayan main kaha gaya ki "ek se dusre judawaan ke prasav samay interval main vruddi kaa hona" jatiltaaon ke badhane se judaa paaya gaya tha or suzav diya ki interval kam rakhaa jaae, haalanki yah ullekhneey he ki adhyayan ne jatiltaaon ke kaarnon kii jaanch nahin kii thi or dai ke anubhav kaa str, mahilaon kii janm dene kii ichha, yaa duusare judawaan ko janm dene kii 'prabandhan ranneeti" jaise karkon par niyantran nahin kiya tha
 Researchers suspect that 1 in 8 pregnancies begin as multiple, but only one fetus completes the term, as others pass away early in pregnancy and are not seen or recorded
 shuruuaati prasuti ultrasonography pareekshanon se kabhi kabhi ek "atirikt" bhrun kaa pataa chalata he, jo viksit hone main vifal rahata he or iske bajaae vikhandit or lupt ho jaataa he
 This is known as Vanishing Twin Syndrome
 sanyukt judawaan ekayugmanaj judawaan hote hai jinke sharir garbhavastha ke dauraan ek duusare ke saath jud jate hai
 This is where the single zygote of the MZ twins completely fails to separate and the zygotic division begins 12 days after fertilization

 a chimera is an ordinary person or animal in which some organs, by exception, are actually from its twin or mother
 ek chimera yaa to ekayugmanaj judawaan bhrun se paidaa hota he, yaa dviyugmanaj bhrunon se, jisame sharir ke vibhinn bhaagon se gunasutra tulana dwaara pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 Cells derived from each embryo can vary from one part of the body to another, and this often leads to an increase in the characteristics of skin color in human chimeras
 chimera intersex arthath purush judawaan or mahila judawaan kii koshikaon se nirmit ho saktaa he
 In addition, in some cases the individual or chimera may have two sets of DNA
 kabhi kabhi ek judawaan bhrun puri tarah se viksit hone main vifal hota he or apane jivit judawaan ke liye samasyaayein paidaa karnaa jari rakhata he
 One fetus behaves like a parasite to another
 kabhi kabhi paraseete judawaan duusare kaa lagbhag aprabhedya hissaa ban jaataa he or kabhi kabhi iske saath chikitsa dwaara nipta jaataa he
 Parasites are a very rare type of twins in which only one viable twin is endangered when another zygote becomes a cancer factor or molar
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ekayugmanaj kaa koshika vibhaajan aniyantrit rup se jari rahata he, jo ek vyavhaarya bhrun se bad kar ek cancer vruddhi kaa rup le letaa he
 Typically, this occurs when a twin has triploidy or has a full parenchymal umbilical cord elevated, resulting in a small embryo or no fetus and a carcinogenic, much larger fetal-like structure that resembles grape bunches
 
 kabhi kabhi, ek aurat ko garbhavastha ke dauraan garbhpaat hojaataa he, phir bhi garbhavastha jari rahati he; ek judawaan kaa garbhpaat ho gaya tha, lekin doosraa apni avadhi puri karne main sakasham rata he
 This phenomenon is similar to Vanishing twin syndrome, but usually occurs after Vanishing twin syndrome
 aamtaur par judawaan bacchon kaa janm ke samay vazan kam hota he or samay se purv prasav kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he jaisaa ki aam taur par adhiktar ekaadhik prasavon main hota he
 Twins on average are relatively small in singleton throughout their lifetime
 ekayugmanaj judawaan bacchon main, jo ek naal se jude hote hai, twin-tu-tvi
 is avasthaa kaa arth he ki ek judawaan se khun duusare judawaan ko bant jaataa he
 One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and anemic and the other recipient twin is large and polycythemic
 is haalat se donon judwa bacchon kaa jivan khatre main pad jaataa hai
 The study of twins is used to determine how much genetics or environmental influences are attributable to a particular trait
 ye adhyayan ekayugmanaj or dviyugmanaj judawaan bacchon kii chikitsiya, anuvaanshik yaa manovaigyanik visheshtaon kii tulana karke yah prayaas karte hai ki jin abhivyaktiyon yaa paryaavarniya prabhaav se anuvanshiki prabhaav ko alag kar saken
 ve judawaan jo jivan kii shuruyaat main alag kar die gaye hai or alag gharon main paley hai, ko visheshkar is prakaar ke adhyayanon ke liye chunaa jaataa he, jinhen maanav swabhaav ke anveshan main vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he
 However, the usefulness and accuracy of the study of these twins has been questioned and remains controversial
 judwaaon se sambandhit shreshth adhyayan ab aanvik anuvanshik adhyayan ke saath padhe jate hai jo vyaktigat jeenon kii pahchaan karte hai
 In rare cases, eggs are fertilized at different times due to sex between two or more times, between twins, twins either in the same menstrual cycle or, more rarely, after pregnancy
 Occurs in phase
 As a result, a woman becomes more likely to have fraternal twins from different fathers
 This phenomenon is known as hetropaiternal superfiction
 1992 ke ek adhyayan kaa anumaan he ki dviyugmanaj judawaan bacchon main hetropaternal superficndation kii aavruti, jinke abhibhavak pitrutv mukaddamon main shaamil the, lagbhag 2
4% thi, adhik jaankaree ke liye, neeche sandarbh anubhag dekhen
 Dizygotic twins arising from pairs of different races may sometimes be mixed twins, which exhibit different ethnic and racial characteristics

 Heterotopic pregnancy is a very rare type of diploid twin in which one twin is normally implanted in the uterus and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an ectopic pregnancy
 asthanik garbhadhaaran kaa avashya hi nidaan kiya janaa chahie kyonki ve maa ke liye jaanaleva ho sakate hai
 However, in most cases, intrauterine pregnancy can be avoided
 atyant durlabh maamalon main, ekayugmanaj judawaan bacchon main, judwa bachche vipareet lingon ke saath paidaa hote hai
 The likelihood of this is so low that multiple babies born with different sexes have been accepted worldwide for medical research on the solid basis that multiple children in the uterus are not monozygous
 jab ekayugmanaj judawaan alag lingon ke saath paidaa hote hai to aisa gunasutra janm dosha ke kaaran hota he
 In this case, although the twins come from the same egg, it is incorrect to call them genetically identical, since they have different karyotypes
 ekayugmanaj alag alag jeenon ke sakriy hone ke kaaran alag alag tareekon se viksit ho sakate hai
 "semi-identical twins" are more unusual
 ye "aadhe-samaan judawaan" bacchon kii pariklpana tab hoti he jab ek anishechit anda do samaan ova main vibhakt ho jaataa he tathaa ye ova nishechan ke anukool hote hai
 Both cloned ova are fertilized by different spermatozoa and these eggs organize into chimeric blastomers and undergo another cell duplication
 yadi yah blostomer ek judawaan ghatana ke rup main badal jaae, to do bhrun banenge, jinamein se prayek kaa alag paitruk jin or samaan matra jin hoga
 As a result, twins will be born with identical genes from the mother's side but with different genes from the father's side
 prayek bhrun kii koshikaayen kisi bhi shukranu se jin grahan karengi, jiske parinamswaroop chimera bachche honge
 Until recently it was recorded in Western medicine, there was speculation about this variety
 jaanwaron kii kai prajatiyon main judawaan bachche aam hai jaise billi, bhed, nevale tathaa hiran
 maweshiyon main judawaan bachche hone kii sambhaavna 1-4% he or judwaaon kii vishmataaon main sudhaar ke liye shodh jari hai, jo breader ke liye adhik laabhadaayak ho sakate hai yadi jatiltaaon se bachaa ja sake yaa unka sahi dhang se prabandhan kiya ja sake

 Ankit Fadia is a personal advisor to computer security
 ve reliance ke saath sanyukt rup se vibhinn companiyon ke liye computer suraksha par jaankaree ke liye ek kaarykram chalaate hai
 There is also a lot of controversy about them
 ankit kii vidyalayan shiksha army public skool se hui
 He started a website called "hacking Truths", which he claimed to be the "second best hacking site in the world that the FBI also believed"
 unka daawa he ki jab ve 14 varsh ke the, unhon ek bhartiya patrika kii website ke mukhya prishth ko tresh kiya tha
 He then sent an e-mail editor acknowledging the hack and suggested measures to prevent hacking
 15 varsh kii aayu main inaki pustak athical hekking ne inhen sabase kam aayu kaa lekhak banaaya, jise bhartiya macmillan ne prakashit kiya
 Fadia denied that many publications had given false information that they were associated with the FBI or CIA

 Fadia studied at Stanford University before graduating
 zad di nait britain kii wendi mcoliphe ke anusaar, bhale hi faadia kii hekking truths website ko "duniya ke duusare sabase achche hekking site" ke rup main efabiai ne manyata di ho, par hekking citon ne ise koi sthaan nahin diya he
 In 2000, Chennai Online reported that Fadia's advisory services customers include the world's largest technology and financial services companies
 kai anya vishwasaneey sroton se is baat kii pushti hoti he ki vaaki faadia ke graahakon kii suchi main bade-bade swatantra suraksha salaahkaar companiya sammilit he
 The same article also mentions Fadia's involvement in exposing a message from the al Qaeda operative, but neither this claim is confirmed by any other source nor by any of Fadia's published works of cryptography
 Or a topic like cryptoanalysis
 april 2000 main rediff
com ne ankit faadia kaa ek saakshaatkaar prakashit kiya
 In his interview, Fadia denied the charge of tampering with the Indian government's website on an anti-indian crew of a group of Pakistani hackers
 faadia ne yah bhi daawa kiya tha ki unhone ek america jasusi sanstha ko pakistani haikar ke hamale ke prati sachet kiya tha
 However, he never took the name of the organization due to security reasons

in, if they wanted, making the website vulnerable to this attack Stop it
 eisi kaa kahana tha ki yadi ve sibiisi website ko hekking karne main safal ho jate hai to faadia ko swayan ek haikar kahana band kar dena chahie
 AIC fulfilled its promise and within two days it tampered with the CBEC website
 ek duusare kharaab kar die gaye website main eisi ne bhartiya media dwaara ankit faadia ke bare main kiye gaye daawey ko "bakawaas" qaraar diya

 The article warned Fadia to uphold morality by teaching young people the tricks of printing American currency on offset lithographic equipment and information about easy-to-download tools to create fake emails and disrupt computers
 
 faadia kaa daawa he ki "computer suraksha course main unki pustak puure dakshin-purv asia main padhai ja rahi he"
 In the year 2005, Fadia has stated that he is writing a thrill to make a film on the lines of Dan Brown's Digital Fortas

 Gadwal is a city in Mahbubnagar district
 Krishna Reddy Bungalow Maharani Adhilaxmi Devamma gharti par kii vaayu jaise-jaise 10 se 15 kilometre tak upar uthati he, vaise-vaise uskaa taap kramash: kam hota jaataa he
 This is the general rule, but it is often seen that there are some levels of air in the atmosphere in which the temperature rises instead of decreasing due to altitude
 taap ke aise staron ko taap kaa utkraman yaa keval utkraman kehete hai
 The rate of decrease of heat due to elevation is called the decay
 oonchaai ke kaaran jab taap kam hone ke sthaan par badhata he, tab kshaydar rinatmak hoti he
 In meteorological essays, such levels of air are also known as reversal, which, while being positive, are lower than the upper and lower airplanes
 utkraman kii maap str kii motaai, tapavriddhi kii dar or str ke taap kii samast vruddhi se kii jaati he
 The overall increase of heat is called the magnitude of reversal
 yadi taap kii vruddhi badi tivrata se ho to use tikshn utkraman or tikshn tathaa vrihat utkraman or tikshn tathaa vrihad donon ho to use prabal utkraman kehete hai
 The lower part of the atmosphere from 10 to 15 km 0, where the precipitation is normally positive, is called the troposphere
 kshobhamandal main utkraman bahut rahata he
 Generally, reversal is always present in some areas of lower elevation
 kshobhamandal ke upar ke bhaag ko samtapmandal kehete hai
 The temperature here is generally stable, or rises very slowly in height
 adhik unche talon par yah adhikta se badhata he
 Permanent reversals of different sharpness occur from 16 to 50 km 0
 prithvi hi sataha par jo utkraman hota he use bhu-utkraman kehete hai
 The reversal is called high reversal in which heat loss is normal in the air below the level
 megh ke rup, aakaar, avakshepan or drishyata ke adhyayan main utkraman kaa mahatvapurn yoga he
 The vertical speed of air, especially its mixture depends on the rate of precipitation
 jab vaayu upar uthati he, tab prasar ke kaaran usamen sheetaltaa utpann hoti he
 If this coldness is greater than the decay, then the ascending air is laterally, the air becomes colder and heavier and has a force, which makes it come to precession
 utkraman ke kaaran urdhv gati par pratirodh hota he ore vaayu kaa upar uthanaa ruk jaataa he
 Reversal actually acts as a lid
 yadi utkraman adhik prakhar he to megh, dharti kii tapt vaayu, dhul or dhuaan utkraman se upar nahin uthte or megh aise taap par nahin pahunchataa jahaan pani kii buund banakar varsha ke rup main neeche gir sake
 Even in the absence of cloud, due to dust and smoke, the air under reversal becomes so cold that it causes cloud or fog
 utkraman vastut: neeche kii ardra vaayu or upar kii anardra vaayu kii seemaa ban jaataa he
 The second effect of reversal has a daily change in temperature
 din main vaayu tapt ho jaati he
 This happens through contact with the earth's surface
 saura vikiran kaa vaayu ke taap par sidhe koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 He warms the ground
 dharaatal hi saura vikiran ko avashoshit karata he or ussen tapt ho jaataa he
 Heated surface heats air by convection and compaction
 sanvahan utkraman se upar nahin jaataa
 Reversal is the upper limit of convection
 yadi utkraman oonchaai par he to vaayu kaa str motaa hoga or adhik vaayu ke garam hone ke kaaran taap kii vruddhi kam hogi
 Due to the cooling of the air by the contact of the cold floor, landslides occur
 bhutkraman ko ratryutkraman, yaa vikiran utkraman bhi, kehete hai
 The surface gets frosty due to radiation on a clean night
 yah akaash main surya nahin he, to prithvi se upar kii or vikeern ooshmaa, vaayu se praapt ooshmaa se adhik hoti he
 This increases the thickness of the reversal and reduces the volume
 yadi utkraman ke neeche kii vaayu osank tak thandhi ho jaae, to usne kuhara banataa he
 If the wind moves strongly, the erosion can be completely lost by the triturated mixture
 isse rudvoshm kshaydar kii sthapana ho jaati he or utkraman kaa upree bhaag tikshn ho jaataa he
 In this case, if condensation occurs, the fog or stratumme goes upwards, which is called the high fog or stratumme
 bhutkraman ke parinaam par sthalakriti kaa bahut prabhaav padataa he
 If the plot is spherical or mountainous, the cold air formed on the higher plot makes the downward, downward, larger and thicker reversal
 unche bhaag par aisa bahut alp, yaa bilkul nahin hota
 Due to the heat below, there is no day-to-day incineration, because air is heated by the radiation of the house and the area above the air is heated by convection and condensation
 jode ki dinon main madhya akshansh par raat kii thandak itani ho jaati he ki din main vaayu ko itnaa garm nahin kar saktaa or usase bhutkraman din din badhata jaataa he
 In such a situation there is a mist of night and day
 aisa kuhara california or madhya europe kii ghaatiyon main dekha jaataa he
 Moving towards North Dhuv, there is absolutely no sun in winter and the earth remains cold for a long time
 isse utkraman kaa pariman bahut bad jaataa he or vah bahut motaa or vistrut ho jaataa he
 Such reversal is called north polar reversal
 kuch kshetron ke 68 pratishat bhaagon main utkraman hota he or uski motaai paryaapt, ausatan 1720 meter tak, kii hoti he
 a strong mixture of fast moving air also causes reversal
 prakshubdh mishran se stari kapaasi, medh banate hai
 In such a situation, the sky can remain cloudy for many days, but it does not rain and even if it is, very little or only drizzle
 vaayu ke str ke neeche khask aane ko avsaad kehete hai, jab vaayu ek saath neeche utarati hai, tab dabaav kii vruddhi hoti he, jisase vaayu ke str kaa sampeden hota he
 The heat of compression is higher for the upper part than the lower, which reduces the temperature of the heat
 jisase upree bhaag or gir jaataa he
 The compression may be so high that the temperature of the lower part becomes higher
 isse utkraman utpann hota he
 Some special conditions cause depression in the anticyclone
 pratichakravaat ke kshetra hai sheetkaal main mahadweep ke uttari kshetra or saare varsh uposhna katibandheey kshetra
 Depression reversal occurs in these areas
 mahadwipiya pratichakravaat ke utkraman gumbad ke kaaar ke hote hai
 Such reversals occur only occasionally in tropical regions
 aise utkraman kaa naam pehle vyapaarik vaayu utkraman rakhaa gaya tha, par peeche dekha gaya ki inkaa vyapaarik vaayu se koi sambandh nahin hai
 When cold and warm air coexist, the cold air spreads like an air
 isse daanon prakaar kii hawaaon ke bich dhaal seemaa banati he
 It is called Frat
 aise frantwale kshetra main bhi utkraman hota he
 The difference between other reversals is that the front reversal is sloping where other reversals are horizontal
 frant utkraman kii ardrata sadhrantaya unchi hoti he or iske upar neeche donon ore megh rah sakate hai
 Front reversal adds great importance to the formation of cyclones
 anek mausami ghataon ke ghatit hone kii vyakhya utkraman se saralata se ho jaati he
 Vaijayantikosha is a lexicon of Sanskrit

 yadhyapi is kosh main aadhunik koshon kii tarah kathorta se varnanukram-niyam kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya he
 Not only this, under the alphabet, only the first letter is formed, the order of the second and third letters is not considered

 According to the Constitution of the United States of America, the President of that country, the co-operative president and all other state officials will be able to be removed from their posts only when the charge of treason, bribe and any other special misconduct is proved by impeachment
 
 Impeachment in different states of America has different form and basis

 Chak Udayar is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under Uttarakhand state of India in Bhanoli tehsil
 dantchikitsa ke kshetra main vishwa bhar main anekon oopaadhiyaan pradaan kii jaatin hai, jaise Tengri was the main deity of the religion of the ancient Turks and the Mongol people
 inaki manyata shiyongnu or shiyanbei jaise bahut si mongol or turki samudaayon main thi or inke naam par un logon ke dharm ko tengri dharm bulaayaa jaataa he
 The earliest Khaganat of the Turkish people, named Goekturk Khaganat, also named him their national deity, and his khaganas also cited the reason for his enthronement as 'tengri's will'
 tengri ko 'akaash kaa devtaa' yaa 'nile akaash kaa pita' kaha jaataa tha
 Mongol rulers often spoke of the desire of 'eternal blue sky' behind their rule
 pracheen mongolon or turkon kaa maananaa tha ki tengri manushyon ko shakti-daan karte the jise unki bhashaa main 'qut' kaha jaataa tha
 Note the pronunciation of the dotted 'q' in the word 'qut' as it is slightly different from the pointless 'k'

 Vessels sail in lakes, seas and rivers
 inhen anek prakaar se upyog main laayaa jaataa he; jaise - logon ko laane-lejaane ke liye, saamaan dhone ke liye, machhlee pakadney ke liye, manoranjan ke liye, taton kii dekharekh evam suraksha ke liye tathaa yuddh ke liye
 Large boats which have been used since ancient times for the movement of sea and travel to distant countries, are called ships
 pehle jahaaj apekshaakrit chote hote the tathaa lakdi ke banate the
 In the modern period of technological and scientific progress, very large, mainly iron-made and engine-driven ships are made
 jis jahaaj se jo bhi kaam liya jaataa he
 Accordingly, it is designed and constructed
 at: kaary ke anusaar jahaajon ko teen virgon main baantate hai : They also have several subclasses, which are further described in chronological order below
 is varg main duubate hue jahaajon ko nikaalanevaale pot samudri taar bichaane tathaa unki marammat karanevaale, tatavarti yatropayogi chote jahaaj, bhojan saamagree le janevaale, matsay naukaaye or ghat-yaan-naukaaye aadi mukhya hai
 The structure of each ship is designed in such a way that its engines, propellants or paddle wheels, assistive devices and punches, etc
, bear the distortions and stresses caused by them, especially due to sea waves
 jahaajon ke chalate samay jab saamne kii hawa kaa mukaabila karnaa hota he
 At that time, if long waves equal to the width of the ship begin to rise, then a single large wave of plum can lift the ship in the balance in the middle
 tab jahaaj ke aage or peeche k sire thik usee prakar se latakate rahenge jaise ki kisi ladi hui shateer ko bich main se sahaara dekar uthaa liya ho
 This condition of the ship is called convexity
 kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki jahaaj kaa aage or peeche kaa sira to laharon par tik jaataa he or bich kaa sthaan khaali ho jaataa he, thik vaisaa hi jaise koi ladi hui shateer donon siron par tiki ho
 In this situation, the stresses on the structure of the ship are called concave
 kabhi kabhi in donon paristhitiyon kaa mishran bhi ho jaataa he, jisamen padanevaale pratibal kartan kehalaate hai
 When the wind moves diagonally, sometimes there are torsional forces in the structure of the ship
 jab bagali hawa chalati he tab parshviya vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai
 Apart from this, excessive pressure of sea water on the submerged part also shows a tendency to stick to the structure
 sabase adhik tathaa vikat prakaar kii vikrutiyaan to aage or peeche ke siron par us samay paidaa hoti hai jab jahaaj main maal ke visham ladaan or laharon ke prabhaav tathaa pani ke utplavak bal ke kaaran jagah jagah par naman ghurna paidaa hone lagate hai
 When calculating the deformations caused by the waves, it is assumed that the length of each wave is equal to the width of the ship and their height is about one-third of the length
 jahaaj ke dhaanche kii abhiklpana karte samay uske prayek avyav kii rachana aisi karte hai ki usapar jo bhi pratibal pade, sab main samavibhajit hokar is prakaar se samast dhaanche main fail jaae ki prayek avyav par aanevaale jhatkon ko avyav milakar sah len
 The bottom of the ship is the basic element at the bottom, by which the entire structure is erected
 ise lohe yaa dhale ispaat dwaara teen prakaar se banaaya jaataa he- ikhari moti chhadon, chapati pattiyon athwa platon dwaara
 Mariya is made in more than one and different sizes
 inamen se jo pramukh hota he vah jahaaj ke pende kii madhya rekha par khadaa lagayaa jaataa he
 All together support the whole body
 pathan ke aage ke sire malljod dwaara
 The component that is lifted up and made of cast steel is called Dumbal
 isi main khaanche banaakar bichwala mariya or bahari khol ke plate baitaakar jad die jate hai
 The erected steel component at the back side is added in this way is called Dumbal pillar or Kudas
 radar ko sahaara dene ke liye or yadi ek yaa teen pranoditr yukt jahaaj hon to madhyavarti pranoditr ke ghoomane ke liye bhi isi main jagah banaai jaati he
 The entire structure of the ship is composed
 panjar ke samast ang angel, aayran or pattiyon dwaara hi banaae jate hai
 These registers are double, one inner and the other outer
 jin sthanon par jahaaj kaa nichalaa farsh tikta he, ve bahari or bhitari panjaron ke bich main khadey lagaae jate hai inhen mariya athwa florce bhi kehete hai
 Due to these, the penda becomes very firm
 jahaaj kii donon bagaliyon ke panjaron ko dridhtaa pradaan karne ke liye, unke bich main lamb pattiyaan tathaa aadi sthunaayen laga di jaati hai
 Perpendicular straps are inlayed by rivets with angle plates from the sides of the ship
 sampurna jahaaj kaa panjar kai khandon main banaakar prayek panjar ke upree sire par bhi ek ek dharan laga di jaati he, jo upree deck ke plate ko sahaara detii he
 In ships having more than one deck, one section each is fitted to handle each deck
 upree deck sadaiv ispaat kii platon kaa banaaya jaataa he or usapar lakdi ke takhte baitha die jate hai
 The lower decks are made of wooden planks
 kuch jahaajon main neeche ke deck bhi ispaat kii platon se banaate hai
 It all depends on usage
 jahaaj ke panjar kii aadi dharanon ke bich, unhen sahaara dene ke liye ek ek khambha bhi ispaat kaa laga diya jaataa he
 Ships that have more width have a pillar attached to either side of the middle pillar
 malwahak jahaajon ke godaamon main adhik khuli jagah kii aavashyaktaa padaa karti he
 Hence, other types of tips are employed by not placing pillars in them
 nital patticas- They are protruding out of the outer shell of the ship and are fitted with the purpose of blocking the ambush of the ship
 inke kaaran jahaaj ke khol kii lunthangati main kaaphi avrodh hota he, jisase lunthangati bilkul to nahin rukne paati, parantu kaaphi kam ho jaati he
 Throughout the length of the ship, the steel plates are made of rock-cut rooms, made of steel plates, made of brackets, ranging in height from the bottom of the bottom to the surface of the seawater
 ye kamare bade upyogi hote hai, kyonki jab ki durghatanavash jahaaj ke aavaran main kahin chhed ho jaataa hai, tab samudri pani keval uske nikatavarti kamare main hi bharkar rah jaataa he or shesh jahaaj surakshit rahata he
 Many times water is deliberately filled in a suitable room to balance the balance of goods loaded in the direction of the length of the ship
 kai puraane prakaar ke jahaajon main to ye kamare is prakaar ke bane hote the ki ek se duusare main jane ke liye unki chat main bane chhed main chadhakar duusare ke chhed main utarana hota tha
 Modern ships have doors installed in their walls
 ye chhed or daravaaje rabar kii pattiyaan tathaa clamp lagaakar bilkul jalaabhedya bana die jate hai
 Merchant ships have at most three decks
 ek dekwale jahaaj kii oonchaai pathan se deck tathaa 15 foot, do deck vaale jahaaj kii oonchaai pathan se upree deck tak 24 foot or tan dekwale kii 35 foot ke lagbhag rahati he
 But the overall height of large seaports and cargo ships exceeds this
 jahaajon kaa bahari aavaran - yah ispaat kii chaadaron kaa bana hota he or uski motaai, jahaaj ke pariman, usamen bhare janevaale maal tathaa jis bhaag main vah jadaa jaataa he vahaan ke pani ke dabaav ke anupaat se nishchit kii jaati he
 The bottom of the ship's bottom and the sidewall, also known as the perge, are thickest
 mandaan tathaa kudas kii nikatavarti platen bhi kaaphi moti hoti hai
 Their maximum thickness is one inch
 aavaran platon kii motaai inch ke 20wein bhaag main naapane kii pratha he
 The center of the ship has the maximum width at the bottom, which is called the "joist"
 iske upar kii taraf chaudaai kramash: kam hoti jaati he, jise jahaaj ke madhya bhaag kaa bhitari jhukaav kehete hai
 It is measured on the same side from the top deck
 aage tathaa peeche ke siron ke nikat, neeche kii ore, jahaaj kii chaudaai kramash: kam hoti jaati he, jisase vahaan ke pariched kii akruti v aakaar kii ho jaati he
 The increasing width above this bottom is called divergence of the ship
 inamen unka mukhya dhaanchaa, doharaa panjar or lamb pattiyaan aadi madhya deck tak hi samaapt ho jaati hai
 The superstructure of the vihara deck and the yacht deck is put on the upper and open deck as the upper structure
 bade yatri jahaaj maal jahaajon kii apeksha adhik baari hone ke saath hi samudr kii sataha se adhik unche bhi tairte rahaa karte hai
 Therefore, they have to be made more firm and careful, so that sea water cannot enter into them even in case of an accident
 tarpedo naukaaon tathaa yupoton ke panjaron kii banaavat to usee dhang kii hoti he jaisi yatri jahaajon kii lekin unhen itnaa drudh banaaya jaataa he ki ve bade bade injanon kii chaal, topon ke daage jane, athwa jahaaj kii chaal ko barambar aage peeche karke paitara badalte samay honevaale companon ke prabhaav kii sah saken
 Their pathanas are made of flat plates and the front ends are folded by putting them in the bowls of mandan and hoe
 phir unhen mall jod dwaara pakkaa bhi kar diya jaataa he
 By tightening the outer and inner cladding plates together with the puncture, the cores of the outer casing plates downward at the same time as the root
 hathiyaaron ke godaamon main ingine or yantron kii oonchaai kii sataha tak suraksha ke liye ispaat kaa motaa kavach plate laga diya jaataa he

 Shivdan Singh Chauhan is known as the first Marxist critic of Hindi literature
 lekhak hone ke saath-saath ve sakriy raajnneetik kaaryakarta bhi the
 Shivdan Singh Chauhan was born on 15 March 1918 in the 'bamani' village of Agra district in Uttar Pradesh
 bachapan main unhen pita tathaa ghar ke bade log 'saudaan' naam se pukaarte the
 His father's name was Thakur Jalim Singh Chauhan, who was a police officer
 naam ke vipareet praayah ve sajjan swabhaav ke vyakti the; haalaanki aparaadhiyon ke prati kathorta apnaane main bhi kami nahin rakhte the
 From childhood, Shivdan Singh Chauhan kept watching this double nature with fear and surprise and it had a great impact on his personality building
 ucch shiksha ke liye unhen elahabaad bheja gaya jahaan ve marxvad se atyadhik prabhavit hokar elahabaad ke agrani vampanthi raajnneetik kaaryakarta ban gayi
 He also became a member of the Communist Party of India in January 1936
 unke pita kii ichha unhen barrister yaa ai
si
es afasar banane kii thi, lekin shivdaan singh ke ativaadee utsaah evam soch kaa alam yah tha ki 1937 main dikshant samaaroh ke avasar par hi bi0e0 kii degree faad kar phenk di
 The literary life of Shivdan Singh Chauhan begins in 1938 AD
 pragatisheel andolan kaa unpar prarambh se hi gaharaa asar tha
 His first book, 'bloody Spain', was published in 1938 AD
 tab se 1960 isvi tak ve puri tatparta evam gambhirtha se saahityalochan main lage rahe
 After this, he was often cut off from literature
 yadhyapi unki pustaken 1978 tak prakashit huin, parantu ve sahitya se sidhe sampark kii pustaken nahin thi
 Shivdan Singh Chauhan was also the initial editor of a well-known literary magazine like Criticism
 shivdaan singh chouhan ke rachanaatmak tathaa vaicharik str kaa vikaas dhire-dhire hua
 Initially, he came across as an enthusiastic Marxist and often dismissed the entire Hindi literature as reactionary
 is aarambhik utsaah kii kai baaten baad main unhen swayan kaaphi galat lagane lagi, jiskaa unhone parishkar karne kaa praytn bhi kiya; lekin kai manyataayen aaajeevan rah gayin
 Chauhan's main objective was to examine the entire literature from a progressive point of view; But he lacked the requisite patience and balanced vision for this
 haalanki isi kii apeksha ve hameshaa duusare aalochakon-sahityakaron se karte rahe or iske liye unhen bura bhala bhi kehete rahe
 He even considered Ramvilas Sharma's criticism-vision and work absolutely insignificant and without considering a single sentence of deliberation, thought of considering his 'tulsidas', 'bharatendu-sahitya' and 'adi Kavya' as progressive according to his time
 Satirized unke anusaar to sharma ji bhi vaise hi aalochakon main the jo samarthy ke abhaav main yen-ken-prakaren har hatkande ko apanaakar apana uddhaar karnaa chaahate hai
 Despite creating so much worthwhile, due to such extreme views and thoughtless comments, Chauhan had become neglected and irrelevant during his middle life and almost all his books had also become unavailable and any new publication from his lifetime Editions not released
 chouhan ji kii mukhya manyataon main se ek yah thi ki hindi sahitya kaa itihaas vastutah khadi boli hindi kaa hi itihaas hona chahie
 In the prevailing form, which is called the modern period of Hindi literature, it was the history of entire Hindi literature for Chauhan Ji
 aadhunik kaal se pehle sahaj swaabhaavik rup se hindi janapad main brajabhasha evam avadhi aadi boliyon main rachana hone tathaa aadhunik kaal main khadi boli ko maanak bhashaa ke rup main sthapit karne ke liye spashtatya prabal praytn ke saare pramaan sahaj hi uplabdh rahane ke baavjood chouhan ji ne apane hi dhang se tark dete hue praayah anya samast vidwaanon dwaara aadhunik kaal se pehle brajabhasha aadi ko hindi sahitya maanane tathaa aadhunik kaal main khadiboli ke sahitya ko hindi sahitya maanakar brajabhasha aadi ko chhod dene ko ataarkik maanate hue 1954 main prakashit apni pustak 'hindi sahitya ke assi varsh' main spasht rup se hindi sahitya ke puure itihaas ko 80 varshon kaa hi mana
 According to him Hindi literature started in 1873 AD
 shivdaan singh chouhan kii aalochana mukhyatah tippanee parak he
 They do not fall into the analysis of the creation of any genre and directly accuse their belief
 kisi ghatana ke sandarbh main vah dharna kaise uchit he yaa anuchit iskaa koi sanket us vivechan se nahin mil paata he
 He calls Chhayavadi poetry to be compatible with the consciousness of the era and praises it very much and states that Chhayavadi poetry is "a poem that runs away from life, devoid of a clear vision, primarily sentimental, its poets' subconscious and unorganized, It was personal and antisocial
 or is abuddhivaadee kavita


" The biggest and astonishing thing is that these absurdism etc
 are not seen in Panth's poetical poems
 unka kahana he ki "pant ji ke sambandh main yah baat ullekhneey he ki ve prarambh se hi pragati ke samarthak rahe hai, jivan-sangharsh se bhaagane kii pravriti un par adhikaar na kar saki
 " kisi ek kavita ke bhi marm-udghaatan karne jaisaa ek vaakya bhi unhone nahin likhaa he; bas tippaniyan karte gayi hai
 In the context of 'ram's Shaktipooja', he writes two sentences like this: "an epic of such a small size-type could have created Nirala's talent
 'ram kii shakti-puja' beej rup main ek mahakavy hi he, kyonki itane sankshep main, or ramakatha ke ek prasang ko lekar hi unhone maanav hriday kii vibhinn sthitiyon or bhaawanaaon kaa sampurna chithran-sa kar diya he
 "the commentary on 'tulsidas' is even more visual-" After 'anamika', this extraordinary ability to create poetry in 'tulsidas' has developed even more
 " Commenting on the play 'skandagupta Vikramaditya' even in prose genres, he writes - "'skanda Gupta Vikramaditya' depicts the valor of the great-grandson of Emperor Chandragupta II of the Gupta dynasty whose memory of every Indian is still proudly elevated get UPS
 hunon se yuddh karte hue skandagupt khet rahe or unke saath hi gupt vansh kaa samrajya bhi nasht ho gaya
 According to Prasad ji, Skandagupta was the only Vikramaditya whose reign was the poet Kalidasa
 skandagupt kaa charitra-chithran adarsh hua he
 The character of Vijaya and Devasena has also become very beautiful
 prasad ke naatakon main 'skandagupt' sambhavat: sabase shreshth he
 " unki aalochana drushti evam style kaa pratinidhi udhaaharan 'premachand or gorki : tulanaatmak adhyayan kii samasya' sheershak aalekh ko mana ja saktaa he
 Ramvilas Sharma called Gorky backward from his era and Premchand with his era in relativity to the then conditions
 dhyatavya he ki yah baat bhoomika main kahi gayi thi
 The overall literary significance of Gorky or Tolastoy was not said to be smaller than that of Premchand
 parantu chouhan ji ne is baat par kaaphi hangaamaa machaaya he
 Without practically discussing any work of Gorky or Premchand, he has proved all the literature of Premchand quite small, quoting Hansraj Rahbar
 unhen gorki se tulana ke laayak tak nahin mana he
 Rather, he is considered quite insignificant compared to Rabindranath and Sharatchandra
 isi dhun main unhone shakespeare, dante, gete or baljak sabko premachand se har tarah se banson unchaa kalakaar mana he
 His understanding of Hindi literature and his inferiority complex were sitting at home as proof that he considers comparing Nirala to TS Eliot or Ezra Pound as unrestrained as comparing Subhadra Kumari Chauhan to Mykowski
 shukla ji ke saath hi hajariprasad dvivedi kii samaj par bhi unhone behichak prashn chinh lagaaya he
 The same Hazari Prasad Dwivedi was speaking about Rabindranath being the best storyteller in northern India in his life time and also by writing a book on him and Chauhan's 'unique' understanding of Premchand and Nirala is also superior Was not even considered worthy of comparison with the author
 jis ramachandra shukla main unhen kamiyon kaa bhandar dikhataa he unke 'hindi sahitya kaa itihaas' ko aaj bhi dekhne par or chouhan ji ke itihaas se tulana karne par donon kii vivechan style main akaash-pataal kaa antar ek saamaanya pathak kii najar se bhi chhipata nahin he
 In the context of Agnayya, his comment is- "agnayya and critics of his ideology are presenting slavery or sickening psychosis in Hindi
 " yah baat ve agyeya ke kisi nibandh yaa unki kavita ke vishleshan ke kram main nahin kehete hai, balki sidhe tippanee karte hai
 With such comments, his long articles were prepared and books came out
 aisi tippaniyon ke bal par unhone ramachandra shukla ko ukhaadne or ramvilas sharma ko pachhaadne kii koshish kii or parinaam yah hua ki sahitya ke pathak samudaay tathaa vidwadvarg donon ke bich aise apraasangik se ho gayi ki unke nidhan ke baad kai logon ke man main vah ati upeksha bhi sahanubhuti jagaane lagi
 Despite all the above things, the contribution of Shivdan Singh Chauhan is important
 shukla ji ke sandarbh main unhone swayan kaha tha ki "praasangikta se adhik shukla ji kaa aitihaasik mahatva he
 "this statement of Chauhan ji, rather than Shukla ji, completely stands up on Chauhan ji himself
 unhone us yug main pragativaadee drushtikon se sambandhit anek nibandhon kii rachana kii jab usase sambaddh bahut si saamagree bhi uplabdh nahin thi
 "it was from these essays that Marxist criticism began in Hindi - without the legacy of Marxist thought and without suitable supporting material from outside
 marks ke 'communist ghoshnaptr' ke alaava unke anya granth bhi sulabh na the, phir unke sahitya-vishyak footkal vichaaron kii to baat hi kya
 Somehow, a copy of Christopher Kadwell's 'illusion and Reality' was made available with difficulty
 chouhan ji kii kul jamaa poonji yahi rahi hogi
 "despite this, he developed literature-thinking in Marxist contexts exclusively
 yah unka aitihaasik mahatva he
