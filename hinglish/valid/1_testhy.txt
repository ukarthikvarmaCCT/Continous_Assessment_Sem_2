 "there is one Truth that shines through all of creation
 Rivers and mountains, plants and animals, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi is a Hindu spiritual leader and guru whom her followers revere as a saint and is also known by the name of "amma", "ammachi" or "mother"
 unki maanavtaavaadi gatividhiyon ke liye unhen vyapak str par sammaan praapt he
 Sometimes they are also referred to as "lovingly embracing saints"
 mata amritanandmayi math ke upaadhyaksh swami amruthasvarupanand puri ke anusaar, "ammaa ke liye dusron ke dukh ko dur karnaa utana hi swaabhaavik he jaise ki apni ankhon ke aansu pochhna
 Amma is happy in the happiness of others
 dusron kii suraksha main hi ammaa apni suraksha maanati hai
 Amma's rest is in the rest of others
 yahi ammaa kaa sapana he
 And this is the dream for which the mother has dedicated her life towards the awakening of humanity
 " Mata Amritanandamayi Devi was born in 1953 as Sudhamani Idamannel in Alappadh Panchayat, District Kollam, Kerala, a small village in Prateekavu
 9 varsh kii aayu main unka vidhyalay janaa band ho gaya tha or ve puure samay apane chote bhai-bahanon kii dekhbhaal or gharelu kaam karne lageen
 As a part of these tasks, Sudhamani Idmannel used to collect the leftover food from his neighbors for his family's cows and goats
 ammaa bataati hai ki un dinon ve atyadhik nirdhantaa or anya logon ke kashton ke kaaran atyadhik dukh se guzar rahi thim
 She brought clothes and food for these people from her home
 unka parivaar, joki dhanwaan nahin tha, iske liye unhen daantata tha or dandit karata tha
 Amma sometimes suddenly hugged people to give them relief from grief
 jabaki us samay ek 14 varsh kii kanya ko kisi ko bhi sparsh karne kii ajna nahin di jaati thi, khaas taur par purushon ko sparsh karne kii
 But Amma continued to do the same despite receiving adverse reactions from her parents
 dusron ko gale lagane kii baat par ammaa ne kaha, "mai yah nahin dekhati ki vah ek stri he yaa purush
 mai kisi ko bhi swayan se bhinn rup main nahin dekhati
 mujhase sansar kii sabhi rachanaaon kii ore ek nirantar prem dhara bahati he
 This is my innate nature
 ek chikitsak kaa kartavya rogiyon kaa upachaar karnaa hota he
 "similarly my duty is to comfort those who are in trouble
 " Amma rejected all the requesters despite her parents' many attempts to marry her
 1981 main, jab anekon jigyaasu paryakadvu main aakar ammaa ke shishy banane ke liye unke mata-pita kii sampatti main rahane lage to, ek vishwastareey sanghathan, mata amritanandmayi math kii sthapana kii gayi
 Amma was the president of this monastery
 aaj mata amritanandmayi math anekon aadhyatmik or dharmarth gatividhiyon main sanlagn he
 In 1987, at the request of her devotees, Amma started organizing programs in all the countries of the world
 Since then she does so every year
 ve desh jahaan ammaa ke kaarykram yojit ho chuke hai uname nimna desh shaamil hai: australia, austria, brazil, canada, chile, dubai, england, finland, frans, germany, holand, ireland, italy, japan, kenya, kuwait, malaysia, morishas, reunion, rashia, singapore, spain, srilanka, sweden, switzarland or sanyukt rajya america
 ve prativarsh bharat main vaarshik bhraman bhi karti hai
 In Sanskrit, philosophy means 'to see'
 In Hindu traditional practice, it refers to seeing a holy person or object
 adarsh rup main yah kisi mandir main ek ishwar kii chhavi main us pavitra vyakti yaa vastu ke darshan ke sadrush hota he
 In viewing the image of a deity, the spectators acquire the powers of that deity through their eyes
 atah darshan main, darshannkarta ko saubhaahgya, kalyaan or ishwariya prabhaav pradaan karne kii kshamta hoti he
 The followers of Amma use this word for a very demanding ritual of loving embrace
 ammaa apni kishoravastha se hi is tarah se darshan de rahi hai
 In relation to how this practice started, Amma says, "people used to come here and tell about their problems
 ve rote the or main unke aansu poncha karti thi
 When they used to cry in my lap, i hugged them
 phir aglaa vyakti bhi mujhase aise hi vyavhaar kii ummid rakhata tha
 

and in this way it became custom
 " ammaa kaa sanghathan, mata amritanandmayi math yah daawa karata he ki ammaa ne is duniya ke 29 million se bhi adhik logon ko apane gale se lagaaya he
 · jab san 2002 main unase yah poocha gaya ki unhen kya lagata he unka aalingan kis had tak duniya ke bimaaron kii sahaayta karata he? ammaa ne kaha, "main yah nahin kahati ki main inaki samasyaon kaa 100 pratishat samaadhaan kar sakati hum
 is sansar ko parivartit karne kaa prayaas karnaa thik vaisaa hi he jaise kute kii tedi poonch ko sidhaa karnaa
 lekin logon se hi samaaj kaa janm hota he
 Therefore, by influencing people, you can bring change in this society and through this change can be brought in this world
 aap parivartan laa sakate hai, par ise puri tarah parivartit nahin kar sakate
 prayek vyakti ke mashtishk main chalane vaala yuddh hi vaastavik yudhon ke liye uttaradaayi he
 So if you can touch people, you can also touch this world
 " This philosophy of Amma is the center of her life as she meets people almost daily since the late 1970s
 iske saath hi ammaa kaa aashirwad paane ke liye aane vaale logon kii sankhya main nirantar vruddhi ho rahi he, kabhi-kabhi to aisa bhi hota he ki vah lagaataar 20 ghanton tak darshan detii rahati hai
 In a 2004 book From Amma's Heart, Amma says in the inscribed dialogue; "as long as my hands will be able to move even a little and reach the people who come to me, and as long as i have the power to put my hand on the shoulder of a crying person and to turn my hands with love and wipe my tears, then Till this time Amma darshan
 Till the end of this mortal world, loving people turn their hands, comfort them and wipe their tears, this is Amma's wish
 " In the book The Timeless Path, Swami Ramakrishnananda Puri, a senior disciple of Amma, writes: "the recitation of Amma in mind is exactly the same as that given in our Vedas and repeated briefly in traditional religious texts after him
 Is like Bhagavad Gita
 " Amma herself says, "karma, knowledge and devotion are all three essentials
 yadi bhakthi or karm ek pakshi ke do pankh hai to gyaan uskaa ant sira he
 Only with the help of these three can the bird reach the heights
 " vah sabhi dharmon kii vibhinn prarthanaaon or aadhyatmik paripaatiyon ko mashtishk ke nirmaleekaran ke ekmaatr uddeshy ke liye vividh paddatiyon ke rup main dekhati hai
 Along with this, Amma also emphasizes the importance of meditation, altruism and the development of divine qualities like compassion, patience, kindness, self control, based on meditation, Karma Yoga, Amma says that practicing these qualities refines our brain, This makes it capable of assimilating the ultimate truth: the ultimate truth is that our existence is not confined within the confines of this body and brain but it is a blissful consciousness that It acts as the Advaita substratum of the universe
 is vichaar ko hi ammaa jeevanmukti kahati hai
 Amma says, "jeevan Mukti is not a state to be attained after death and you will not experience or attain it in any other world
 It is a state of complete consciousness and samvadhi which is experienced by this living body The same can be done in this world right now
 apane swa ke saath ekikrut hokar is ucchtam satya kaa anubhav karne ke baad, aisi aanandamay aatm ko punah janm lene kii aavashyaktaa nahi hoti
 vah anant chetana ke saath ekikrut ho jaati he
 " ammaa ke vishwavyaapee dharmarth mishan main beghar logon ke liye 100,000 ghar, 3 anaath ashram banane kaa kaarykram or 2004 main bhartiya sagar main tsunami jaisi aapadaaon se saamana hone kii avasthaa main raahat-or-punarvaas, muft chikitsakeey dekhbhaal, vidhwaaon or asamarth vyaktiyon ke liye pension, paryaavarniya suraksha samooh, malin bastiyon kaa navinikaran, vridhon ke liye dekhbhaal centre or garibon ke liye muft vastra or bhojan aadi kaarykram sammilit hai

 yah sabhi sanghathan sanyukt rup se ambracing da world ke rup main jane jate hai
 When asked in 2004 how the development of his charitable mission was going, Amma said, "as far as activities are concerned, it is not based on any plan
 sab kuch sahaj rup se hota he
 Seeing the plight of poor and distressed people, one task became the medium of another
 Amma meets every person, she sees their problems directly and tries to overcome their sufferings
 lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu, yah sanathan dharman ke pramukh mantron main se ek he, jiskaa arth hota he, 'is sansar ke sabhi praani prasann or shantipurna rahen

 " "mere bachche unhen bhojan karaate hai jo bhukhe hai, garibon kii sahaayta karte hai, dukhi logon ko santvanaa dete hai, peediton ko raahat pahunchaate hai or sabhi ke prati daansheel hai
 " ammaa apane bhakthi sangeet ke liye bhi bahut prasiddh hai
 More than 100 recordings of the hymns sung by him are available in more than 20 languages
 unhone dariinon bhajanon kii rachana kii he or unhen paaramparik raagon ke anusaar dhaala he
 Regarding singing of devotional songs as a spiritual practice, Amma says, "if the hymns are taken with concentration, it is beneficial to the singer, listener and nature
" baad main jab shrota bhajan par vichaar karte hai to ve bhajanon main uccharit paathon ke anuroop rahane kaa prayaas karte hai
 "amma says that in today's world, it often becomes difficult for people to concentrate during meditation, but this concentration can be easily achieved through devotional singing

 Animals have many special qualities that differentiate them from other living things
 jantu eukeriotic or bahu koshikeey hote hai,, jo unhen jeevanu va adhikansh protista se alag karte hai
 They are heterotrophic, usually digesting food in an inner chamber, which makes them distinct from plants and algae, they can also be differentiated from plants, algae and fungi because they lack a hard cell wall
 All animals are moving, even if they are in a particular phase of life
 adhiktam jantuon main, bhrun ek blastula avasthaa se hokar gujarata he, yah jantuon kaa ek vibhedak gun he

 The selective pressure exerted on one another has led to an evolutionary race between prey and predator, resulting in many anti-predator adaptations
 zyaadaatar jantu apratyaksh rup se surya ke prakaash se hi urja praapt karte hai
 Plants use this energy to convert sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya carbon dioxide or jal ke saath shuru hoti he, isamen surya ke prakaash kii urja ko rasinic urja main badal diya jaataa he, jo glucose ke bandhon main sanchit ho jaati he, is prakriya ke dauraan oxigen bhi mukt hoti he

 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa
 Likely earthworms would have been large and complex
 iske alaava lagbhag 1 billian varsh purv tonian yug kii shuruyaat main, stromatolait main kami aayi
 The diversity that currently informs the arrival of animals grazing as stromatolites increased diversity, shortly after the end of the Ordovician and Permian, causing large numbers of grazing marine animals to become extinct in their populations
 Shortly after the recovery, their number decreased

 However, a Fellow genomic study of 150 genes in 21 species in 2008 suggests that it is Tinophora or comb jelly that forms the basis of animals in at least 21 of those associations
 lekhak vishwaas rakhte hai ki spanj yaa kam se kam ve spanj jo unhone khoje hai- itane aadim nahin hai, lekin iske bajaay dwitiyak rup se sarlikrut kiye ja sakate hai
 In other phyla, Tinophora and Nideria, including sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric, having a digestive chamber with a single pore, which serves both the mouth and the anus
 donon main spasht vibhedit utak hote hai, lekin ye angon main sangathit nahin hote hai
 There are only two main germ levels, ectoderm and endoderm, between which only the cells are scattered
 isi liye in jantuon ko kabhi kabhi diploblactic kaha jaataa he
 Small placozoa are similar, but do not have a permanent digestive chamber

 Krishna Reddy Bungalow Maharani Adhilaxmi Devamma As the wind on the house rises from 10 to 15 kilometers, its temperature gradually decreases
 yah saamaanya niyam he, par bahudhaa dekha jaataa he ki vayumandal main vaayu ke kuch aise str paae jate hai, jinamein oonchaai ke kaaran taap kam hone ke sthaan par badhata he
 Such levels of heat are called heat reversal or simply reversal
 oonchaai ke kaaran taap ke kam hone kii dar ko kshaydar kehete he
 When the temperature rises instead of decreasing due to elevation, the decay is negative
 mausam vigyaan sambandhi nibandhon main vaayu ke aise staron ko bhi utkraman kehete hai, jinke kshaydar dhanatmak hone par bhi upar or neeche ke vayustaron se kam ho
 The reversal is measured by the thickness of the level, the rate of rise, and the overall increase of the level's temperature
 taap kii samast vruddhi ko utkraman kaa pariman kehete hai
 If there is a rapid rise of heat, it is called acute reversal and sharp and large reversal and both sharp and large, then it is called strong reversal
 vayumandal ke 10 se lekar 15 kimi0 tak se neeche ke bhaag ko, jahaan kshaydar saamaanya ghanaatmak hoti he, kshobhamandal kehete hai
 In the troposphere there is a lot of reversal
 samaanyatya kam oonchaai ke kuch kshetron main utkraman praaia: sadaa hi upasthit rahata he
 The upper part of the troposphere is called stratosphere
 yahan kaa taap saamanyat: sthaayee rahata hai, athwa oonchaai main bahut hi dhire dhire badhata he
 It grows more and more at higher levels
 16 se lekar 50 kimi0 tak ke bich vibhinn teekshantaa ke sthai utkraman hote hai
 The reversal that occurs on the surface of the earth itself is called land reversal
 us utkraman ko ucch utkraman kehete hai jisamen str ke neeche kii vaayu main taap kii kami saamaanya hoti he
 Evolution is an important addition to the study of the form, shape, precipitation, and visibility of clouds
 kshaydar par hi vaayu kii urdhv gati, visheshat: uskaa mishran nirbhar karata he
 When air rises, coldness arises due to diffusion
 yadi yah sheetaltaa kshaydar se adhik he to arohi vaayu parshvavarti he vaayu se thandhi or baari ho jaati he or usapar bal padataa he, jisase vah purvavastha main aa jaae
 Due to reversal, there is resistance at upward motion and the air stops rising
 utkraman vastut: dhakkan kaa kaam karata he
 If the reversal is more intense then the cloud, the hot air of the earth, dust and smoke do not rise above the reversal and the cloud does not reach such a temperature where a drop of water can fall in the form of rain
 megh ke abhaav main bhi dhul or dhuen ke kaaran utkraman ke neeche kii vaayu itani thandi ho jaati he ki usase megh yaa kuhara banataa he
 The reversal actually becomes the boundary of the humid air below and the humid air above
 utkraman kaa doosraa prabhaav taap ke dainik parivartan par padataa he
 Air gets hot during the day
 aisa dharti kii sataha ke sampark se hota he
 Solar radiation has no direct effect on air temperature
 vah dharaatal ko tapt kar detaa he
 The ground itself absorbs solar radiation and gets heated
 tapt dharaatal sanvahan or sannayan dwaara vaayu ko garm karata he
 Convection does not go above reversal
 utkraman hi sanvahan kii upree seemaa he
 If the reversal is high, then the air level will be thicker and the increase in heat will be less as more air is heated
 sheethal tal ke sansparsh se vaayu ke thandi hone se bhutkraman hota he
 Landslide is also called nighttime reversal, or radiation reversal
 svachh raatri main vikiran se dharaatal thandha ho jaataa he
 If it is not the sun in the sky, the heat above and above the earth is higher than the heat obtained from the air
 isse utkraman kii motaai bad jaati he or pariman main kami aa jaati he
 If the air below the reversal becomes cold to the dew point, it forms a fog
 yadi pawan tej chalata he, tase prakshushm mishran se bhutkraman bilkul lupt ho ja saktaa hai
 This causes the formation of rheumatoid arthritis and the upper part of the reversal becomes sharp

 Topography has a great impact on the result of landslides
 yadi bhukhand golakaar yaa pahaad he, to ucch bhukhand par bani thandi vaayu neeche kii ore badhati hui, nichi bhoomi ke upar vrihat or adhik motaa utkraman banaati he
 On the higher side it is very rare, or not at all
 neeche kii garmi ke kaaran din main bhutkraman nahin hota, kyonki gharti ke vikiran se vaayu garm ho jaati he or vaayu ke upar kaa kshetra sanvahan or sannayan se garm ho jaataa he
 In couple of days, at mid latitude, the coolness of the night becomes so much that it cannot heat the air so much during the day and due to this the landslide increases day by day
 aisi dasha main vahaan raat or din kuhara chaaya rahata he
 Such fog is seen in the valleys of California and Central Europe
 uttar dhuv kii ore badhane par jaade main dhoop bilkul nahin hoti or dharti bahut samay tak thandi rahati he
 This greatly increases the magnitude of reversal and makes it very thick and broad
 aise utkraman ko uttar dhruviya utkraman kehete hai
 Reversal occurs in 68 percent of some areas and has a substantial thickness, up to 1720 meters on average
 tej chalati hui vaayu ke prakshubdh mishran se bhi utkraman hota he
 The stratified capsules are formed by mixing with a strong mixture
 aise megh se kai dinon tak akaash meghachndit rah saktaa he, par usase varsha nahin hoti or yadi hoti bhi he to bahut hi kam yaa keval boonda baandi
 Depletion below the level of air is called depression, when the air comes down simultaneously, the pressure increases, causing the compression of the air level
 sampeden kii ooshmaa upree bhaag ke liye nichle bhaag se adhik hoti he, isse taap kii kshaydar kam ho jaati he
 Causing the upper part to fall further
 sampeden itnaa ho saktaa he ki nichle bhaag kaa taap ucchtar ho jaae
 This causes reversal

 The areas of cyclone are the northern regions of the continent in winter and the subtropical regions all year round
 inhen kshetron main avsaad utkraman hota he
 The continental anticyclone reversal consists of the KAR of the dome
 aise utkraman ushn katibandheey kshetron main kabhi kabhi hi hote hai
 Such reversal was previously called commercial air reversal, but it is seen backwards that they have no relation to commercial air
 jab thandi or ushn vaayu saath saath rahati he, tab thandi vaayu sphan si failati he
 This creates a gradient boundary between the two types of winds
 ise frat kehete hai
 Reversal also occurs in such frontier areas
 anya utkramanon se isamen bhed yah he ki jahaan anya utkraman kshaitij hote hai vahaan frant utkraman dhalaanvaala hota he
 The humidity of front reversal is generally high and above this, there can be cloud on both sides
 frant utkraman chakravaat ke nirmaan main bade mahatv kaa yoga detaa he
 The occurrence of several seasonal decreases is easily explained by reversal

 jab kisi bade adhikari yaa prashaasak par vidhanmandal ke samaksh aparaadh kaa doshaaropan hota he to ise mahabhiyog kaha jaataa he
 This process was born in England by the trusting authority of the State Council Curia Regis
 samyoparant jab curia yaa parliment kaa house of lards tathaa house o kaamans, in do bhaagon main vibhaajan hua to yah abhiyogadhikaar house ov lards ko praapt hua
 But since the form of prosecution of judges and ministers has been determined in other ways, the use of impeachment is abolished
 england main kuch mahabhiyog itane mahatvapurn hue hai ki ve swayan itihaas ban gaye
 For example, the impeachment of Warren Hastings and Lord Melville in the 16th century is a constant memory
 sanyukt raashtra america ke samvidhan ke anusaar us desh ke raashtrapati, sahakaari raashtrapati tathaa anya sab rajya padaadhikari apane pad se tabhi hataae ja sakenge jab unpar rajdroh, ghoose tathaa anya kisi prakaar ke vishesh duraachaaran kaa aarope mahabhiyog dwaara siddh ho jaae 
 
 america ke vibhinn rajyon main mahabhiyog kaa swaroop or aadhaar bhinn bhinn rup main hai
 Each state has made different rules regarding impeachment for its employees, but in nine states, no specific reasons have been given for conducting impeachment, ie, impeachment can be done on any basis
 neuyark rajya main 1613 i main vahaan ke governor wiliam suljar par mahabhiyog chalaakar unhen padchyut kiya gaya tha or aashcharya kii baat yah he ki abhiyog ke kaaran shri suljar ke governor pad grahan karne ke purv kaal se sambandhit the
 There is another valid difference in impeachment action in England and America

 Antioxidants themselves are oxidized to these free radicals, which helps to break the chain reaction

 Numerous degrees are awarded around the world in the field of dentistry, such as tengri pracheen turk logon or mongol logon ke dharm ke mukhya devtaa the
 They were recognized in many Mongol and Turkish communities such as Shionganu and Xianbei and the religion of those people is called Tengri religion
 turki logon kii sabase pehali kagaanath ne, jiskaa naam goekaturk kagaanath tha, bhi inhen apana rashtriya devtaa tehraaya tha or uske kagaan bhi apni gaddi par virajman hone kaa kaaran 'tengri kii ichha' bataate the
 Tengri was called the 'god of the sky' or 'father of the blue sky'
 aksar mongol shaasha apane raaj ke peeche 'sanathan nile akaash kii ichha' hone kii baat kiya karte the
 The ancient Mongols and Turks believed that the Tengri donated power to humans, which was called 'kut' in their language
 'qut' shabd main bindu-vaale 'qa' ke uccharan par dhyaan den kyonki yah bindu-rahit 'k' se zaraa alag he 
 The names of many Turkish and Mongol celebrities were based on the word 'qut', such as 'qutlugh', 'tengrikut' and 'qutlamish'
 haalaanki tengri dharm ko turki or mongol kshetron main islam or buddha dharm aane se lupt ho gaya, lekin uske chihn abhi bhi is kshetra main faile hue hai - September 17 is the 260th day of the year
 jalayaan yaa pani kaa jahaaj, pani par tairte hue gati karne main sakasham ek bahut bada dibba hota he
 a ship is different from a boat in that it is much larger than a boat
 jalayaan jhiilon, samudron evam nadiyon main chalate hai
 They are used in many ways; Such as - to bring people, to carry goods, to catch fish, for recreation, to maintain and protect the beaches and for war
 jahaaj samudr ke avaagaman tathaa dur deshon kii yatra ke liye jin brihad naukaaon kaa upyog prachinkaal se hota aayaa he unhen jahaaj kehete he
 Earlier ships were relatively small and made of wood
 pravidhik tathaa vaigyanik unnati ke aadhunik kaal main bahut bade, mukhyat: lohe se bane tathaa injanon se chalanevaale jahaaj banate hai
 The ship from which whatever work is taken
 usee ke anusaar uski abhiklpana or nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, according to work, the ships are divided into three classes: inke bhi kai upvarg hote hai, jinka neeche krmanusaar aage varnan kiya gaya he- In this class, vessels for sinking ships, laying and repairing sea wire, small onboard, small ships, food vessels, fishing boats and ferries, etc
 are the main ones
 prayek jahaaj ke dhaanche kii abhiklpana is prakaar se kii jaati he ki uske injanon, pranoditron athwa pedal wheelon, sahaayak yantron tathaa panchon aadi ke chalane ke kaaran or visheshkar samudri laharon ke kaaran jo vikrutiyaan tathaa pratibal paden, unhen vah sah le
 When the ships are moving, when the front air has to compete
 us samay yadi jahaaj kii chaudaai ke baraabar lambii lehren uthne lagati hai, to kai ber koi ek hi badi lahar bich main jahaaj ko adhar main uthaa le sakati he
 Then the front and back ends of the ship will hang with the same type as if a laden beam is lifted from the middle
 jahaaj kaa is dasha ko uttalan kehete hai
 Sometimes it happens that the front and back end of the ship gets stuck on the waves and the middle space becomes empty, just as a laden beam rests on both the ends
 is paristhiti main jahaaj ke dhaanche par padanevaale pratibalon ko avatalan kehete he
 Sometimes there is a mixture of these two situations, in which the stress is called shearing
 jab hawa tirchhi chalati he tab kabhi kabhi jahaaj ke dhaanche main marod pratibal padate hai
 Lateral deformations occur when sideways air moves
 iske atirikt pani main duube rahanevaale bhaag par samudri pani kaa bhi atyadhik daab padakar dhaanche ko chipkaane kii pravriti dikhaata he
 Most and severe types of deformations occur at the front and rear ends when the vessel is produced due to the uneven loading of goods and the impact of waves and buoyant force of water
 laharon dwaara padanevaali vikrutiyon kii gananaa karte samay maan liya jaataa he ki prayek lahar kii lambaai jahaaj kii chaudaai ke baraabar or unki oonchaai lambaai ke wein bhaag ke urabar he
 While designing the structure of a ship, each of its components is designed such that whatever stress is placed on it, is divided into all and spread across the structure in such a way that the components on each component bear the shock
 jahaaj kaa pathan sabase neeche rahanevaala buniyadi avyav he, jiske sahare samast dhaanchaa khadaa kiya jaataa he
 It is made by iron or cast steel in three ways - single thick rods, flat strips or plates
 mariya ek se adhik tathaa vibhinn aakaar ke banaae jate hai
 The major of these is standing on the center line of the ship's bottom
 sab milakar samast pende ko sahaara dete hai
 The front end of the Pathan by Mallajod
 upar ko uthaa hua jo avyav dhale hue ispaat kaa banaakar joda jaataa he vah dumbal kehalaata he
 In this, the middle maria and the outer shell are made by sitting on a plate and roots are made
 peeche kii taraf dhale ispaat kaa jo khadaa avyav isi prakaar joda jaataa he vah dumbal stambh yaa kudas kehalaata he
 In order to support the rudder and if there are ships with one or three propellants, the intermediate propellant is made to rotate in the same place
 jahaaj ke samast dhaanche kii rachana panjaranuma hoti he
 All parts of the pan are made by angle, iron and bandages
 ye panjar dohare hote hai, ek bhitari or doosraa bahari
 The places where the lower floor of the ship rests are placed between the outer and inner sides, also known as maria or floors
 inke kaaran penda bahut hi drudh ho jaataa he
 To provide stability to the sides of the two sides of the ship, vertical strips and horizontal strings are placed between them
 lamb pattiyaan jahaaj ke panjar se angal platon ke saath reveton dwaara jad di jaati hai
 The entire ship's scaffold is made in several sections and a dhramana is attached to the upper end of each side, which supports the plate of the upper deck
 jin jahaajon main ek se adhik deck hote hai, unamem prayek deck ko sanbhaalane ke liye prayek khand main ek ek sthuna lagaai jaati he
 The upper deck is always made of steel plates and wooden planks are placed on it
 neeche ke deck lakdi ke takhton se hi banaae jate hai
 In some ships the bottom decks are also made of steel plates
 yah sab upyog par nirbhar karata he
 a pillar is also made of steel to support them, in the midst of the clutches of the ship's sides
 jin jahaajon kii chaudaai adhik hoti he unke madhya khambhe ke donon ore ek khambha or laga diya jaataa he
 Cargo warehouses require more open space
 at: unamem khambhe na lagaakar anya prakaar kii yuktiyon se kaam liya jaataa he
 Nital plaques ye jahaaj ke bahari aavaran se baahar kii ore nikali rahati hai tathaa jahaaj kii lunthangati ko avarodhit karne ke uddeshy se lagaayi jaatin hai
 Due to these, there is a lot of obstruction in the deceleration of the ship's shell, due to which the plunger does not stop at all, but it is reduced considerably
 jahaaj ke pende par puri lambaai bhar main, ispaat ke platon ko brakaton dwaara jadkar, unase bheetein banaakar jalaabhedya kamare bana die jate hai, jinaki oonchaai dotale pende se lekar samudri pani kii sataha tak hoti he
 These rooms are very useful, because when accidentally a hole is made in the ship's casing, the sea water is filled only in the adjacent room and the rest of the ship is safe
 kai baar jahaaj kii lambaai kii disha main laden hue maal kaa santulan thik karne ke liye kisi upyukt kamare main jaan boojhkar bhi pani bhar diya jaataa he
 In many old types of ships, these rooms were made in such a way that to get from one to the other, they had to climb into the hole made in their roof and get into the hole of the other
 aadhunik jahaajon main unki deevaaron main hi daravaaje laga die jate hai
 These holes and doors are made absolutely elastic by applying rubber straps and clamps
 vyapaaree jahaajon main adhik se adhik teen deck hote hai
 The height of a decked ship is approximately 24 feet from the height of the deck and 15 feet, the height of the two-deck ship is 24 feet from the plateau to the upper deck and 35 feet for the tan deck
 lekin bade samudri poton or maal jahaajon kii samgr oonchaai isse adhik ho jaati he
 Outer cover of ships - It is made of sheets of steel and its thickness is determined by the ratio of the volume of the ship, the cargo to be filled in it and the water pressure of the part in which it is fastened
 jahaaj ke pende or adwal se neeche ke plate, jinhen peraj bhi kehete hai sabase mote rakhe jate hai
 The adjacent plates of Mandan and Kudas are also quite thick
 inaki adhik se adhik motaai ek inch hoti he
 It is customary to measure the thickness of the cover plates to the 20th of an inch
 jahaaj ke madhya bhaag main neeche kii taraf sabase adhik chaudaai rahati he, jise "dharan naap" kehete hai
 The width of the top side of it decreases gradually, which is called the inner inclination of the middle part of the ship
 ise upar ke deck se ek hi taraf ko napa jaataa he
 Near the front and rear ends, downwards, the width of the ship decreases gradually, making the shape of the passage there to be V-shaped
 is neeche se upar badhati chaudaai ko jahaaj kaa apsaran kehete hai
 In this, their main structure, double sides and long strips etc
 are finished till the middle deck
 vihaar deck tathaa nauka deck kii adhirachana upree dhaanche ke rup main uparale or khule deck par kar di jaati he
 Large passenger ships, while being heavier than cargo ships, floated higher than the sea surface
 at: unhen adhik drudh tathaa saavdhaanee se bananaa padataa he, jisase koi durghatana ho jane par bhi samudri pani unamem pravesh na kar sake
 The registers of torpedo boats and warships have the same design as those of passenger ships, but are made so firm that they move when moving engines, firing cannons, or moving the ship repeatedly
 To withstand the effect of vibrations occurring
 inaki pathan chapate platon se banaakar uske aage peeche ke siron ko mandaan or kudaal kii jhiriyon main daalkar mode diya jaataa he
 Then they are also confirmed by mall joints
 bahari or bhitari pathan platon ko panjar ke saath takkari jod dwaara kasakar, neeche kii taraf bahari aavaran platon kii koron ko pathan ke saath hi jad dete hai
 In the arms godowns, a thick steel armor plate is fitted for protection to the height of the engine and equipment
 sabase aage kii potbhit tathaa dumbal ke bich kuch khaali jagah chhod di jaati he, jise takkar pitabhit kehete hai

 shivdaan singh chouhan hindi sahitya ke pratham marxvaadi aalochak ke rup main khyath hai
 Along with being a writer, he was also an active political activist
 shivdaan singh chouhan kaa janm uttar pradesh ke agra jile ke 'bamaani' gaanv main 15 march 1918 ko hua tha
 As a child, he was called as 'saudan' by his father and elders
 unke pita kaa naam thakur jaalim singh chouhan tha, jo ki police afasar the
 Unlike the name, he was often a gentleman; However, he was also not lacking in adopting strictness towards criminals
 bachapan se hi unke is dohare swabhaav ko shivdaan singh chouhan bhay evam aashcharya se dekhte rahe or iskaa unke vyaktitv nirmaan par kaaphi asar padaa
 He was sent to Allahabad for higher education where he became highly influenced by Marxism and became a leading leftist political activist of Allahabad
 janvari 1936 main hi ve bhartiya communist party ke sadsy bhi ban gaye the
 His father's desire was to make him a barrister or an ICS officer, but Shivdan Singh's extreme enthusiasm and thinking was such that on the occasion of the convocation ceremony in 1937 he threw away his BA degree
 shivdaan singh chouhan kaa lekhkeey jivan 1938 isvi se aarambh hota he
 The progressive movement had a profound impact on him from the beginning
 1938 isvi main unki pehali pustak 'raktranjit spain' kaa prakaashan hua
 From then until 1960, he engaged in literature with full readiness and seriousness
 iske baad ve sahitya se praayah katate gayi
 Although his books were published by 1978, they were not books of direct contact with literature
 aalochana jaisi suprasiddh saahitiyik patrika ke aarambhik sampadak bhi shivdaan singh chouhan hi the
 The creative and ideological level of Shivdan Singh Chauhan developed gradually
 aarambh main ve atiutsaahi marxvaadi ke rup main saamne aaye or praayah sampoorn hindi sahitya ko pratikriyaavaadi kararkar khaarij kar diya
 Many of the things of this initial enthusiasm were later found to be quite wrong, which he also tried to refine; But many beliefs remain lifelong
 chouhan ji kaa mukhya uddeshy pragativaadee drushtikon se sampurna sahitya ko jaanchane-parakhane kaa tha; parantu iske liye apekshit dhairya tathaa santulit drushti kaa unamem nitant abhaav rahaa
 However, he always kept expecting other critics and litterateurs to do the same and for this he also called them bad
 yahan tak ki ramvilas sharma kii aalochana-drushti tathaa kaary ko unhone bilkul naganya mana tathaa vivechan ke ek vaakya ke bina hi unke 'tulsidas', 'bhaaratendu-sahitya' tathaa 'aadi kavy' ko apane samay ke anusaar pragatisheel maanane ke vichaar par karaara vyangy kiya
 According to him, Sharma ji was also among the critics who want to save himself by adopting every tactic in the absence of power
 bahut-kuch sarthak rachane ke baavjood aise ativaadee vichaaron tathaa vivechan rahit tippaniyon ke kaaran hi chouhan ji apane madhya jeevankaal main hi upekshit evam apraasangik se ho gayi the or unki praayah sari pustaken bhi anuplabdh ho gayi thim or unke jivan-paryant kisi prakaashan se naye sanskaran nahin nikle
 One of the main beliefs of Chauhan was that the history of Hindi literature should be the history of Hindi
 prachlit rup main jise hindi sahitya kaa aadhunik kaal kehete hai vahi chouhan ji ke liye sampoorn hindi sahitya kaa itihaas tha
 Even before the modern era, naturally, in the Hindi district, Brajbhasha and Awadhi etc
, despite the fact that all the evidences are available in the dialect of Brajbhasha and Awadhi etc
 and clearly the effort to establish the standing dialect as the standard language in the modern era is readily available
 Reasoning in its own way, almost all other scholars consider Brajbhasha etc
 as Hindi literature before modern times and modern In his book, 'eighty Years of Hindi Literature', published in 1954, considering the literature of Khadiboli as the Hindi literature, it was considered irrational to consider the entire history of Hindi literature as 80 years
 unke anusaar hindi sahitya kaa aarambh 1873 i0 main hua
 Criticism of Shivdan Singh Chauhan is mainly commentary
 ve kisi vidha kii rachana ke vivechan-vishleshan main na padakar sidhe apni dharna ko aropit karte jate hai
 No indication of how that perception is justified or inappropriate in the context of an event is found
 chhayavaadi kavita ko kahin ve yug kii chetana ke anukool kehete hai or uski baari prashansa karte hai or kahin kehete hai ki chhayavaadi kavita "jivan se bhaag nikalne vaali kavita, spasht drushtikon se rahit, mukhyatah bhavnapradhan thi, uske kaviyon kii antarvritiyaan avchetan evam asangathit, vaiyaktik evam asaamaajik thi
 And this puritanical poem 


 " sabase badi or ascharyajanak baat yah he ki ye abuddhivaad aadi durgun unhen pant ji kii chhayavaadi kavitaaon main nahin dikhte hai
 He says that "in relation to Pant ji, it is remarkable that he has been a supporter of progress from the beginning, the tendency to run away from life-struggle could not take possession of him
 " He has not written even a single sentence like the opening of any poem; Just kept commenting
 'ram kii shaktipuja' ke sandarbh main ve do vaakya is prakaar likhte hai- "itane chote aakaar-prakaar kaa mahakavy niraala ji kii pratibha hi rach sakati thi
 'shakti-worship of Rama' is an epic in seed form, because so subtly, and with an episode of Ramkatha, he has made a complete depiction of the various conditions and emotions of the human heart
 " 'tulsidas' par tippanee or bhi drushtavy he- " 'anamika' ke baad 'tulsidas' main prabandh-kavy rachane kii is asaadhaaran samarthy kaa or bhi vikaas hua he
 " gadhy vidhaon main bhi 'skandagupt vikramaditya' naatak par tippanee karte hue ve likhte hai- " 'skanda gupt vikramaditya' main gupt vansh ke samraat chandragupta dwitiya ke praputra ke us shaury kaa chithran he jisaki smriti se prayek bharatvasi kaa mastak aaj bhi garv se unchaa uth jaataa he
 Skandagupta kept the field while fighting with the Huns and with him the empire of Gupta dynasty was also destroyed
 prasad ji ke anusaar skandagupt hi vah vikramaditya the jinke raaj kavi kalidas the
 The characterization of Skandagupta is ideal
 vijaya or devsena kaa charitra bhi atyant sundar ban padaa he
 'skandagupta' is perhaps the best among Prasad's plays
 " a representative example of his critique of vision and style can be considered in the article titled 'premchand and Gorky: Problems of Comparative Studies'
 ramvilas sharma ne tatkaaleen paristhitiyon kii saapekshata main gorki ko apane yug se pichhadaa tathaa premachand ko yug ke saath kaha tha
 It is important that this was said in the role
 gorki yaa tolastoy ke samgr saahitiyik mahatva ko premachand se chota nahin kaha gaya tha
 But Chauhan ji has created a lot of uproar on this matter
 gorki yaa premchand kii kisi rachana kii vyavhaarik taur par charchaa ke bina hi unhone hansraj rahabar ke hawaale se premachand ke saare sahitya ko kaaphi chota siddh kar diya he
 He is not even considered worthy of comparison with Gorky
 balki rabindranath or sharatchandra kii tulana main bhi unhen kaaphi mahatvaheen mana gaya he
 In the same tune, he has considered Shakespeare, Dante, Goethe and Balzac all to be a superior artist in every way from Premchand
 hindi sahitya ke prati unamem kitni samaj or kisi hin bhaavana ghar jamaaye baithi thi iskaa pramaan is rup main miltaa he ki ve niraala kii tulana tii es aliot yaa ezara pound se karnaa utana hi anargal maanate hai jitna ki subhadra kumari chouhan kii tulana maaychovsky se
 Along with Shukla ji, he has also put unflinching question mark on the understanding of Hazariprasad Dwivedi
 vahi hajaari prasad dvivedi rabindranath ke saannnidhya main rahakar tathaa un par pustak likhakar bhi premachand ko apane jivan kaal main hi uttari bharat main sarvshereshth kathakaar ban chuke hone kii baat kah rahe the or chouhan ji kii 'vishisht' samaj premachand tathaa niraala ko bhi kisi shreshth lekhak se tulana ke laayak tak nahin maan rahi thi
 The Ramchandra Shukla, in which he sees a repository of shortcomings, on seeing his 'history of Hindi literature' even today and comparing it with the history of Chauhan ji, the difference in the style of thinking both of them does not hide even from the eyes of an ordinary reader
 is
 agyeya ke sandarbh main unki tippanee he- "agyeya or unki vichaardhaara ke aalochak hindi main foohad athwa kutsit manovaigyaniktaa kaa pratipaadan kar rahe hai
 "he does not say this in the order of any essay of the agnostic or analysis of his poem, but directly remarks
 aisi tippaniyon se unke lambey-lambey aalekh taiyaar hote gayi or pustaken nikalati gayin
 On the basis of such comments, he tried to overthrow Ramchandra Shukla and beat Ramvilas Sharma and as a result, readers of literature became so irrelevant among both the community and the scholar that after his demise he suffered extreme neglect in many minds
 Even aroused sympathy
 ukt sari baton ke baavjood shivdaan singh chouhan kaa avdaan mahatvapurn he
 In the context of Shukla ji, he himself said that "shukla ji has more historical importance than relevance
 " chouhan ji kii yah baat shukla ji ke bajaay swayan chouhan ji par hi puri tarah se khari utarati he
 He composed many essays related to the progressive approach in that era when there was not much material related to it
 "inhen nibandhon se hindi main marxvaadi aalochana kii shuruyaat hui-- bina kisi marxvaadi chintan kii viraasat ke or baahar se praapt upyukt sahaayak saamagree ke
 Apart from Marx's 'communist Manifesto', his other books were not accessible, then what about his literary ideas
 le-dekar badi mushkil se christopher kadwell kii 'ilugen and reality' kii prati kisi kisi ne uplabdh kar lee thi
 It would have been Chauhan's total accumulated capital
 " iske baavjood unhone sahitya-chintan ko marxvaadi sandarbhon main khaastaur se viksit kiya

 mandal str par matsay vibhaag kii prayogshaalaon dwaara matsay paalkon ke talabon kii mitti pani kii ni:shulk jaanch kii jaati he tathaa vaigyanik vidhi se matsay paalan karne ke liye takneekee salaah di jaati he
 Presently, 12 laboratories of Fisheries Department are functioning
 kendriya prayogshaala matsay nideshaalay, 7 faijabad road, lakhanu main sthit he
 Remaining 11 laboratories are working in Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Azamgarh, Mirzapur, Allahabad, Jhansi, Agra, Bareilly, Meerut divisions under Deputy Director Matsya and Gujratal fishery sector in Jaunpur district
 matsay paalan prarambh karne se purv yah atyadhik aavashyak he ki machhlee kaa beej daalane ke liye talab purna rup se upyukt ho
 Excessive aquatic plants in the pond are harmful for good fish yield
 yah paudhe pani kaa bahut bada bhaag ghere rahete hai jisamen machhlee ke ghoomane-phirane main asuvidha hoti he
 At the same time, they also create a barrier to the rays of the sun reaching inside the water
 parinamswaroop machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan utpann hona ruuk jaataa he or prakritik bhojan ke abhaav main machhlee kii vruddhi par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Apart from this, these plants increase their potency by polluting the chemical substances found in the soil and the nutritional value of water is reduced
 machhlee pakadaney ke liye yadi jaal chalaaya jaay tab bhi yah paudhe rukawat daalate hai
 Generally, there are three types of aquatic plants in ponds - one with water surface such as hyacinth, lemna etc
, second root-like lotus etc
 and third water-immersed like hydrilla, najaj etc
 yadi talab main jaleey paudhon kii maatra kam ho to inhen jaal chalaakar yaa shramik lagaakar jad se ukhadkar nikaala ja saktaa he
 In case of excess aquatic vegetation, use of chemicals such as 2-4 d sodium salts, teficide, hexamar and Fernaxan in 8-10 kg per hectare of water area, water hyacinth, lotus etc
 are destroyed
 rasayanon ke prayog ke samay vishesh jaankaree matsay vibhaag ke karyaalayon se praapt kii jaani chahie
 Some submerged plants are the favorite food of grass carp fish, so they can be prevented by grasping grapes in the pond
 upyukt yahi he ki anaavashyak paudhon kaa unmoolan maanav-shakti se hi sunishchit kiya jaay
 In the old ponds many unnecessary animals like turtles, frogs, crabs and fishes like Sindhri, Puthiya, Chelwa etc
 and eater fishes are found for example Pichin, Tangen, Saul, Girai, Singhi, Mangur etc
 which are available to feed the food available in the pond
 Receive as food
 maansaahaari machhliyaan carp machhliyon ke bacchon ko kha jaati he jisase matsay paalan par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Therefore, their cleanliness is absolutely necessary
 avaanchhneeya machhliyon kaa nishkasana baar-baar jaal chalaakar yaa pani nikaal kar athwa mahua kii khali ke prayog dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Mahu cake should be used in a pond with a depth of one meter of water in one hectare area at the rate of 25 quintals
 iske parinaam swaroop 6-8 ghanton main sari machhliyaan mar kar upar aa jaati hai jinhen jaal chalaakar ekatra karke bazaar main bechaa ja saktaa he
 Use of Mahu cake has dual effect for the pond
 vish ke alaava 15-20 din baad yah khaad kaa bhi kaary karti he jisase machhlee ke prakritik bhojan kaa utpaadan hota he
 Light alkaline water is beneficial for fisheries
 pani amleey athwa adhik kshareey nahin hona chahie
 Lime increases the alkalinity of water or balances the acidicity and alkalinity of water
 iske atirikt chuunaa machhliyon ko vibhinn paropjiviyon ke prabhaav se mukt rakhata he or talab kaa pani upyukt banaata he
 250 kg of lime in one hectare pond should be used one month before fish seed accumulation
 talab kii taiyaari main gobar kii khaad kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This produces natural fish food
 gobar kii khaad, matsay beej sanchay se 15-20 din purv saamaanthya 10-20 ton prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kii jaani chahie
 If the mahua cake has been poured in the preparation of the pond for the removal of undesirable fish, then there is no need to put the first installment of cow dung
 saamanyat: rasinic khaadon main uria 200 kilogram, singil super phosphate 250 ki0gra0 va murat of potash 40 ki0gra0 arthath kul mishran 490 ki0gra0 prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kiya janaa chahie
 In this way, a mixture of chemical fertilizer of 49 kg per hectare per month should be put in the pond after 15 days of use of cow dung
 yadi talab ke pani kaa rang gaharaa haraa yaa gaharaa nila ho jaye to urvarkon kaa prayog tab tak band kar dena chahie jab tak pani kaa rang uchit avasthaa main na aa jaye
 Accumulation of pure seeds of such good fish species in the pond should be ensured that, while staying in the same aquatic environment, do not harm each other and consume the food available on different surfaces of the pond and grow rapidly
 bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu evam nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp evam kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan vishesh laabhakaari hota he
 Pure seed of the best fish species is a basic requirement of fisheries
 uttar pradesh matsay vikaas nigam kii hechariyon tathaa matsay vibhaag ke prakshetron par utpaadit beej kii aapurti matsay paalkon ko oxygen packing main talab tak nirdhaarit sarkari daron par kii jaati he
 Special emphasis is being given on the privatization of fish seed production with the objective of making Uttar Pradesh self-sufficient in the field of fish seed production and up to Rs 8
00 lakh for setting up a mini fish seed hatchery with a capacity of 10 million in the private sector
 Facility of loan and 10 percent government grant is permissible
 matsay paalak nijee kshetron main sthapit chote aakaar kii hechariyon se bhi shuddh beej praapt kar sakate hai
 Such fish species should be reared in the pond, which will grow rapidly by using the food available on each surface without harming each other by living together in an environment so that maximum fish production from a confined water area To be sure bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu, nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp va kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan kaaphi laabhakaari hota he
 Before storing fish seed in the pond, it is worth noting that preparations have been completed and organic production has been done
 machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan jise planctan kehete hai paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hona chahie
 The availability of one milliliter of plant in 50 liters of water in the pond indicates that fish seed can be stored
 ek he0 jal kshetra main 50 mi0me0 aakaar se kam kaa 10,000 matsay beej tathaa 50 mi0me0 se adhik aakaar kii 5000 angulikaayen sanchit kii jaani chahie
 If six types of domestic and foreign carp fishes are being mixed, then the ratio of katla 20 percent silver carp 10 percent, rohu 30 percent, grass carp 10 percent, nan 15 percent and common carp 15 percent is appropriate
 yadi silver carp va grass carp machhliyon kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he or 4 prakaar kii machhliyaan paali ja rahi hai to sanchay anupaat katala 40 pratishat, rohu 30 pratishat, nain 15 pratishat va kaaman carp 15 pratishat hona laabhakaari hota he
 If only Indian major carp fishes are being reared then the ratio of katla 40 percent, rohu 30 percent, nan 30 percent should be
 kaaman carp machhlee kaa beej march, april va may main tathaa anya carp machhliyon kaa beej july, agast, sitambar main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For high yields of fish, it is absolutely necessary to have suitable soil and water in the pond
 aisi mitti jisamen sand 40 pratishat tak, silt 30 pratishat tathaa clay 30 pratishat ho evam pi-ech 6
5 se 7
5 ho, matsay paalan hetu talab nirmaan ke liye upyukt hoti he
 When the percentage of sand in the soil is high, there is a problem of water in the pond
 adhik kshareey mrudaa bhi matsay paalan hetu upyukt nahin hoti he
 The soil of the pond should contain 50 mg of nitrogen and 6 mg of phosphorus per 100 grams of soil and one percent organic carbon
 yadi uplabdh nitrogen, phosphorus evam argenic carbon saamaanya se kam he to nirdhaarit matraaon main jaivik va rasaynic urvarkon kaa prayog karte hue talab ko matsay paalan hetu upyukt banaaya ja saktaa he
 The color of the water of the pond is light brown because the natural food plantation of fish is available in this type of water
 pani halkaa kshareey hona upyukt hota he
 PH of water 7
5 to 8
5 dissolved oxygen 5 mg per liter, independent carbon dioxide 0 to 0
5 mg per liter, total alkalinity 150–250 mg per liter, chlorides 30–50 mg per liter and total hardness 100–180 mg per liter Should be up to matsay paalkon ke talabon kii mitti-pani kaa ni:shulk pareekshan matsay vibhaag kii prayogshaalaon dwaara kiya jaataa he tathaa vaigyanik vidhi se matsay paal karne hetu takneekee salaah di jaati he
