 ise draveebhoot hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi ke sah-laghuganak ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 The activity coefficients of hydrogen ions cannot be measured experimentally, so they are based on theoretical calculations
 ph scale, koi sunishchit scale nahin he; iskaa sambandh maanak vilyan ke ek set ke saath hota he jiske ph kaa akalan antarrashtriya sanvida ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The concept of ph was first introduced in 1909 by the Danish chemist Sören Peder Lauritz Sørensen of the Carlsberg Laboratory
 yah abhi bhi agyaat he ki p kii sateek paribhaasha kya he
 Some references suggest that p signifies "power" and others refer to it as the German word "potenz", and still others refer to it as "potential"
 jens norbi ne 2000 main ek patr prakashit kiya jisamen usne tark diya ki p, ek sthiraank he or "rinatmak laghuganak" kaa pratik he; jiskaa prayog anya kaaryon main bhi kiya jaataa he
 h is a symbol of hydrogen
 sorensen ne suvidha ke liye "PH" sanket kaa suzav diya jo "power of hydrogen" kaa pratik he jisamen solution, p main hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ke sah-laghuganak kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Although this definition has been superseded

 chikitsa shaastra, jeev vigyaan, rasayan shaastra, khaadya vigyaan, paryaavaran vigyaan, samudr vigyaan or kai anya anuprayogon main ph ke maapan kaa bahut mahatv he
 ph is defined as the decimal logarithm subtraction of the activity of hydrogen ion in an aqueous solution
 isaki laghuganakeey prakruti kii visheshta ke kaaran, ph, ek ayamarahit quantity he
 Where a h is the activity of hydrogen ions
 is paribhaasha kaa kaaran yah he ki a H, kisi ekal aayan kaa ek gun he jise keval ek aayan-chaynaatmak electrode kii sahaayta se prayogtmak rup se mapa ja saktaa he jo nernst sameekaran ke anusaar hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke saath pratikriya karata he
 The ph is usually measured with the help of a composite glass electrode that measures the potential difference or electromotive force, E, between an electrode sensitive to the activity of hydrogen ion and a reference electrode such as a calomel electrode or a silver chloride electrode
 is
 sanyukt glass electrode adarshatah nernst sameekaran kaa anusaran karata he: Where e is a measured potential and e 0 is the standard electrode potential ie the standard state electrode potential with activity also being one
 R, gas sthiraank he; T, kelvin taapmaana he; F, farade sthiraank he or n, hastantarit electrons kii sankhya kaa ek udhaaharan he
 The electrode potential, E, is proportional to the logarithm of the activity of the hydrogen ion
 yah paribhaasha apane aap main puri tarah se avyaavhaarik he kyonki hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi, sandratha or gatividhi gunank kaa gunanfal hota he
 The coefficient of activity of a single-ion of a hydrogen ion is a quantity that cannot be measured experimentally
 is kathinaayee se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye, electrode ko gyaat gatividhi ke solution ke sambandh main anshakit kar diya jaataa he
 The operational definition of ph is officially defined by the International Standard ISO 31-8 as follows: For solution X, the galvanic cell's electromotive force, EX is measured | kcl kaa sandrit solution || solution x | H2 | Pt or tab ek galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e s ko bhi mapa jaataa he jo gyaat maanak ph ke solution s ke dwaara agyaat ph ke solution X, ph kii pratisthapana dwaara uparyukt se bhinn hota he
 Then x has a ph of solution x ke ph or maanak solution ke ph ke bich kaa antar keval do maape gaye potential ke bich ke antar par nirbhar karata he
 Thus, ph is obtained from a potential measured with an electrode calibrated against one or more ph standards; a ph meter setting is adjusted such that the reading of the meter of the standard solution is equal to the ph value
 maanak solution s ke ek range ke ph maanon ko, aage kii vistrut jaankaree ke saath, IUPAC kii anushansa main darshaya gaya he

 In such cases the calibration of the electrode can be done with a concentrated sulfuric acid standard solution whose ph values can be calculated using Pitzer parameters to calculate activity coefficients
 ph, ek amlata ke function kaa udhaaharan he
 The concentration of hydrogen ion can be measured in aqueous solvents, but this results in a different acidity function because the standard state of aqueous solvent is different from the standard state of water
 superacids, ajaleey amlon kaa ek varg he jiske liye hamet amlata ke function, h 0 ko viksit kiya gaya he
 This was Sorensen's original definition superseded in favor of ph
 haalanki, hydrogen yanon kii sandratha ko pratyaksh rup se maapna sambhav he, yadi hydrogen ke aayan kii sandratha ke sandarbh main electrode ko anshakit kiya jaataa he
 One way to do this, which has been used on a large scale, is to measure the solution of known concentrations of a strong acid with a solution of known concentrations of strong alkali in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte
 chunki acid or kshar kii sandratha gyaat hoti he isliye hydrogen yanon kii sandratha kii gananaa karnaa aasaan hota he taaki maape gaye potential ko sandratha ke saath sah-sambhddha kiya ja sake
 anshaakan kaa kaary praayah gran plot kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa he
 The calibration generates a slope factor, f and a value for the standard electrode potential, e 0, to form the Nernst equation
 main e ke praayogic maapan se hydrogen aayan sandratha ko praapt karne ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 The slope factor is usually slightly less than one
 0
95 se kam kaa ek slop factor yah darshata he ki electrode sahi dhang se kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 The presence of background electrolyte ensures that the hydrogen ion activity coefficient is effectively constant during titration
 chunki yah sthir hota he isliye iske maan ko maanak sthiti ko paribhaashit karke ek main sthapit kiya ja saktaa he jo becoground electrolite yukt solution hota he
 Thus, the activity resulting from the use of this process is equated to the numerical value of the concentrations
 p or ph ke bich kaa antar bahut kam hota he
 It has been said that ph = p + 0

 Unfortunately, it is very common to use the noun "ph" for both types of measurements
 poh ko kabhi-kabhi kshariyata yaa hydroxide yanon, OH− kii sandratha ke ek maap ke rup main prayukt hota he
 poh cannot be measured independently but is derived from ph
 jal main hydroxide yanon kii sandratha, Is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions where KW is the constant of self-ionization of water
 nimna sah-laghuganak ko liya jaataa he So, at room temperature poh ≈ 14 - ph
 However, in other circumstances such as measurement of soil alkalinity, this relationship is not fully valid
 shuddh jal lagbhag 7 ph hota he; sateek maan, taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 When an acid is dissolved in water, the ph will be less than 7 and when an alkali or an alkali solution is made in water, the ph will be greater than 7
 The ph of a solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at 1 mol dm − 3 concentration is 0
 1 mol dm−3 sandratha par sodium hydroxide jaise kisi strong kshar ke solution kaa ph, 14 hota he
 Thus, the measured ph values will mostly be within 0 to 14
 Since ph is a logarithmic scale, a ph unit difference is equal to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration
 chunki glass electrode, gatividhi kii pratikriya karata he isliye electrode ko kisi aise madhyam main anshakit kiya janaa chahie jo kisi jaanch kiye ja rahe madhyam ke samaan hota he
 For example, if one wants to measure the ph of a sample of seawater, the electrode must be calibrated in a solution that has a chemical composition similar to that of seawater, which is detailed below

 For example, the ph of pure water at 50 ° c is 6
55
 dhyaan den, haalanki, hawa ke sampark main aane vaala jal thodaa-thodaa acidic hota he
 The reason for this is that water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which then slowly transforms into carbonic acid, which liberates the hydrogen ion and separates it: ek strong acid ke maamle main, sampurna pruthakkaran hota he isliye ph saadharantah acid sandratha ke laghuganak ke ghataav ke baraabar hota he
 For example, a 0

 Dandi has considered the "apabhransh" language as the dialect of Abhiradi
 nagar apbhransh ke hi parvarti rup se, jise maakobi jaise vidvan gurjar apbhransh yaa shwetambar apbhransh kahana adhik thik samajhate hai, gujarati-rajasthani kaa vikaas hua he
 Gujarati was originally a division of Rajasthani, which was undivided until the sixteenth century, but later became an independent language for cultural, provincial and literary reasons
 pashchimi rajasthani yaa marwari jahaan gujarati or sindhi ke adhik nikat he vahaan purvi rajasthani brajabhasha se paryaapt rup main prabhavit he
 Nevertheless, there are clear distinguishing elements even in eastern Rajasthani, who refuse to consider it as the division of Hindi
 rajasthani bhashaa kii bhashashastreey sthiti rihaari tathaa pahari kii tarah un bhashaaon main he, jinhen hindi kii vibhaasha nahin mana ja saktaa, kintu hindi ke saanskrithik tathaa saahitiyik itihaas ke saath iskaa gathbandhan itnaa drudh ho gaya he ki saahitiyik drushti se rajasthani bhashaa kii swatantra satta na rah pai or yah uski vibhashasi ban gai
 There is enough ancient literature available in Rajasthani
 jain yeti ramsingh tathaa hemachandracharya ke dohe rajasthani gujarati ke apbhransh kaaleen rup kaa parichay dete hai
 Even after this, many prose works are available in Old Western Rajasthani in addition to Fagu, Raas and Churchery poems of Jain poets
 prasiddh gujarati kavy padmanabhakavikrut "kanhdadeprabandh" vastut: puraani pashchimi rajasthani yaa marwari kii hi kriti he
 Similarly, the language of most of the verses of "prakritpaangalam" indicates the language-nature of eastern Rajasthani
 yadi rajasthani kii in saahitiyik kritiyon ko alag rakh diya jaae to hindi or gujarati ke saahitiyik itihaas ko madhyayug se hi shuru karnaa padegaa

 Tessittori was presented in the "indian Ancient", which is still the only authentic book of Rajasthani philology
 hindi main dow chaturjyaan kii ""rajasthani bhashaa"" ke atirikt rajasthani bhashaa ke vishay main koi pramanik bhashashastreey kriti uplabdh nahin he
 Although there are two or three books, their approach is introductory or literary, not pure philological
 grearsan kii linguistic survey main rajasthani boliyon kaa vistrut parichay avashya miltaa he
 The medieval literature of western Rajasthani is rich
 rajdhani kii hi ek kritrim saahitiyik style dingal he, jisamen paryaapt chaaran-sahitya uplabdh he
 Folk poems like "dhola Ma Degree Ra Doha" and ornate poetic works like "beli Crison Rukmani Ri" have contributed to the Rajasthani Srivriddhi
 bhashaagat vikendrikaran kii niti ne rajasthani bhashabhashi janata main bhi bhashaa sambandhi chetana paidaa kar di he or idhar rajasthani main aadhunik saahitiyik rachanaayen hone lagi he
 Rajasthani is written in Nagari script
 iske atirikt yahan ke puraane logon main ab bhi ek bhinn lipi prachlit he, jise "banyaan vati" kaha jaataa he
 Quantities are often not given in this script
 rajasthani baniye aaj bhi bahikhaaton main is lipi kaa prayog karte hai
 The literary form of Rajasthani language is Dingle and Dingle literature is a rich literature
 Dingle literature has many texts
 It was developed from 7-8th century
 dow grearsan ne rajasthani kii paanch boliyaan maani hai- Western Rajasthani, uttar purvi rajasthani, Middle Eastern Rajasthani, dakshin-purvi rajasthani, Southern Rajasthani
 grearsan ne bhili or khandeshi ko swatantra bhashaa varg main mana he, kintu dow chaturjya inhen "rajasthani varg" ke hi antargat rakhana chahenge, jo adhik samichin jaan padataa he
 The grammar composition of Bhuli dialects and Khaneshi dialects of Dungarpur, Banswara, Pratapgarh and nearby areas is not particularly different from Rajasthani
 vastut: ye rajasthani ke ve rup hai jo kramash: gujarati or marathi tatwon se mishrit hai
 The Rajasthani category also includes the Gujari dialect of the frontier states of Pakistan and Kashmir and the Saurashtra dialect of Tamil-nad, which seems to be associated with East Rajasthani
 dow chaturjya ne grearsan ke rajasthani ke paanch boli-bhedon ko nahin mana he
 They consider it right to call Marwadi and Poghadi Hadauti as "rajasthani"
 unke anusaar rajasthani ke dohi varg he :- Western Rajasthani, purvi rajasthani 
 They are in favor of considering Mevati, Malvi and Nimari as divisions of Western Hindi, although they do not give a final decision in this regard
 rajasthani bhashaa kii saamaanya visheshtaayen nimna hai- In Rajasthani, three distinct sounds are "n", "e" and "l"
 rajasthani tadbhav shabdon main mul sanskrit "a" dhwani kai sthanon par "i" tathaa "i" "u" ke rup main parivartit hoti dekhi jaati hai-"minak", haran, k"maar 
 In Mewadi and Malvi, the pronunciation of "ch, Chh, J, Jha" is found like Bhili and Marathi like "ts, S, Dj, Z" respectively
 sanskrit hindi padaadi "sa-dhwani" purvi rajasthani main to surakshit he, kintu mewari-maalavi-marwari main aghosh "hth" ho jaati he

 The strong pulling words of Rajasthani, like Hindi, are not Okrant but Okarta: - Horse, Ra

 pashchimi rajasthani main sambandh kaarak ke parasarg "ro-raa-ri" hai, kintu purvi rajasthani main ye hindi kii tarah "ko-kaa-kii" hai
 In jaipuri-hadauti, the use of the "nai" parasite is also found in the form of conscious action and sampradaya, in addition to the passive subject, "chora nai chori mari"; "mhu Chhora Nai Marcianu"; "yo Ladoo Chhora Nai De Do"
 rajasthani main uttam purush ke shrotri-saapeksh "aapaan-aapan" ore shrotri nirpeksh "mahe-mhen-me" duhare rup paae jate hai
 Like Hindi, the present-day verb forms of Rajasthani are pure forms, rather than the auxiliary verb, and the developed form
 "muun jaaon chhun" 
 Forms of the auxiliary verb are "hoon-yea-ho-hai" and "tho-thi-tha" in western Rajasthani, but "chhun-chhan-chho-chha" and "chho-chhi-chha" in eastern Rajasthani
 rajasthani main teen prakaar ke bhavishyatkalik rup paae jate hai :-jaavago, jasi, jaavalo
 Among them, the second form is the development of the future three forms of Sanskrit - "jasi", Jasyu
 rajasthani kii anya padrachanaatmak visheshta purvakalik kriya ke liye "-r" pratyay kaa prayog he : -"uu-pard-r roti khaasi" 
 Prominent among the syntactic features of Rajasthani is the use of sampradaya karaka with the verb of the proper verb, while in Hindi the use of "karana or apadan" is seen here 1 "ya baat unnai kaha do"
 purvi rajasthani main hindi ke hi prabhaav se sampradaangat prayogke atirikt vikalp se kaaran-apadangat prayog bhi sunai padataa he-"yaa baat uun suun kah do"

 The first task the new company received was to design a car for the people from the German government, a German: Volkswagen

 Porsche authorized a Zuffenhausen-based company, Reutter Karosserie, which had previously collaborated with the firm on the Volkswagen Beetle prototype to produce the 356 steel body

 Porsche's signature design included, from the outset, an air-cooled rear-engine configuration feature, which was rare for other car manufacturers, but produced automobiles that were very well balanced

 911 has become Porsche's most well-known and iconic model - successful at race-tracks, rallies and in terms of road car sales
 Compared to any other model, the Porsche brand is defined by the 911

 In 1972, the company's legal form was changed from the Kommanditgesellschaft, or Limited Partnership, to the Aktiengesellschaft or Public Limited Company, as Ferry Porsche and his sister, Louise Peach, felt that there was good interaction between members of their generation Can not sit with It led to the establishment of an executive board, whose members were from outside the Porsche family, and a supervisory board consisting mostly of family members
 With this change, no family member was in the company's operating charge

 bahut se vidyut yaa electronic ghatakon yaa avyavon ko jodakar vidyut paripath banate hai
 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series

 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary

 Bezung steel is a steel that is not rusty with atmospheres and organic and inorganic acids
 saadhaaran ispaat kii apeksha ye adhik taap bhi sah sakate hai
 These properties in steel arise from the addition of chromium
 isamen 15-20% chromium, 8-10% nickel tathaa saadhaaran steel hota he
 Chromium deactivates the outer surface of the steel
 pratirodhi shakti kii vruddhi ke liye isamen nikal bhi milaayaa jaataa he
 Partial or complete manganese is also used in place of nickel
 aklush ispaat ke nirmaan main lohe main kabhi-kabhi tamra, cobalt, titanium, niobium, tentalium, colombium, gandhak or nitrogen bhi milaayaa jaataa he
 With the help of these, intact steel of various chemical, mechanical and physical properties can be made

 In each of these ways, steel is divided into three classes
 carbon ke anusaar vargeekaran karne par ispaat nune, madhyam or ucch carbonavaale ispaat kehalaate hai
 Even in terms of structure, steel is divided into three classes: feritic ispaat, jo kade kiye hi nahin ja sakate
 Of these, chromium is between 15 percent and 30 percent and the amount of carbon is very less
 martensettic ispaat, jo tapt karke pani main bujhane par kade ho jate hai
 These contain 10 percent to 18 percent chromium and 0
08 percent to 1
10 percent carbon
 astanitic ispaat, jo bina bujhaae hi kadaa kiya ja saktaa he
 It contains 16 percent to 26 percent chromium and 6 percent to 22 percent
 paralatic ispaat kathor kiya ja saktaa he or aisa karne par uski sanrachana martensettic ke samaan ho jaati he
 Decay-resistance strength in chromium steel arises due to the formation of a thin permanent layer of ironchromium oxide on the outer plane
 yah patali parat apane neeche sthit ispaat ke kshay ko rokatii he
 If this layer is destroyed by chemical action or rub, then another such fold is formed immediately
 ucch taap par bhi yah tah dridhtaa se chipki rah jaati he or oxikaran ko rokatii he
 The minimum amount of chromium to make iron inert is 12 percent

 ve roj shaam ko prarthana kiya karte the
 On the evening of 30 January 1948, as he was going for evening prayers, a man named Nathuram Godse touched his feet first and then fired three bullets at him from the front with a Barreta pistol
 us samay gandhi apane anucharon se ghire hue the
 In this case, eight people including Nathuram Godse were accused in the conspiracy to murder
 in aath logon main se teen aropiyon shankar kistaiya, digambar badge, vir saavarkar, main se digambar badge ko sarkari gavaah banane ke kaaran bari kar diya gaya
 Shankar Kistaiya was forgiven on appeal to the High Court
 vir saavarkar ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin milane kii vajah se adaalat ne jurm se mukt kar diya
 Later on the death of Savarkar, the Government of India issued a postage stamp in his honor

 Prayers were held at Birla Bhavan at five in the evening, but Gandhiji was busy in a meeting with Sardar Patel
 tabhi sava paanch baje unhen yaad aayaa ki prarthana ke liye der ho rahi he
 The evening of 30 January 1948, when Bapu placed his hands on the shoulders of Aura and Manu moved towards the stage that Nathuram Godse came before him
 usne haath jodakar kaha - "namaste baapu!" gandhi ke saath chal rahi manu ne kaha - "bhaiya! saamne se hat jaao, baapu ko jane do
 Bapu is already late
 " lekin godse ne manu ko dhakka de diya or apane haathon main chupa rakhi choti bareta pistal se gandhi ke seene par ek ke baad ek teen goliyaan daag deen
 Two bullets escaped through Bapu's body, while one bullet stuck in his body
 78 saal ke mahatma gandhi kii hatya ho chuki thi
 Gandhi's body was covered in Birla House
 lekin jab unke sabase chote bete devdas gandhi vahaan pahunche to unhone baapu ke sharir se kapadaa hataa diya taaki duniya shaanti or ahimsa ke pujari ke saath hui hinsa ko dekh sake
 According to the statement given by Nathuram Godse in the court, the pistol with which Gandhi was targeted was purchased from a refugee in Delhi
 gandhi kii hatya karne ke maamle main mukhya abhiyukt nathuram godse sahit kul aath vyaktiyon ko aaropee banaakar mukadmaa chalaaya gaya tha
 Their names are as follows: birla bhawan main prarthana sabha ke dauraan gandhi par 10 din pehle bhi hamalaa hua tha
 a Punjabi refugee named Madanlal Pahwa had thrown a bomb targeting Gandhi but narrowly escaped
 bam saamne kii diwaar par fata jisase diwaar tut gayi
 Gandhi would never have thought that someone wanted to kill him
 gandhi ne dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan shuru kiya tha jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 50 karod rupee kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and violence would spread on the border
 gandhi kii jid ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne is rakam kaa bhugtan kar diya lekin hindu sanghathanon ko laga ki gandhi ji musalamaanon ko khush karne ke liye chaal chal rahe hai
 The incident of the bomb blast was linked to this decision of Gandhi
 nathuram isse pehle bhi baapu ke hatya kii teen baar koshish kar chukaa tha, lekin asafal hone par vah apane dost narayan apte ke saath waapas bombay chalaa gaya
 Together they along with Dattatreya Parchure and Gangadhar Dandavate bought a pistol named Barreta
 asalhe ke saath ye donon 29 janvari 1948 ko waapas dilli pahunche or dilli stesan ke ritearing room nambar 6 main tehre
 It was only five months after the country was liberated that the news of differences between Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel started coming in the media
 gandhi aisi khabaren saamne aane se behad dukhi the or ve iskaa jawaab dena chaahate the
 He even wanted him to ask Sardar Patel to resign so that Nehru would see the entire functioning of the government
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 On 30 January 1948, he called Patel for talks at four o'clock in the evening and after the prayer was over, asked him to discuss the issue
 lekin niyati ko yah manjuur nahin tha
 Patel along with his daughter Maniben reached Gandhi on time
 patel ke saath meeting ke baad prarthana ke liye jate samay gandhi godse kii goliyon kaa shikaar ho gayi
 Gandhi used to say that his life is in the hands of God and if he were to die then no one could save him
 unhone ek baar kaha tha-"jo azaadi ke bajaay suraksha chaahate hai unhen jeene kaa koi haq nahin he
 "though a watchman used to live at the gate of Birla Bhavan
 tatkaaleen grih mantri sardaar patel ne ehtiyaat ke taur par birla house par ek head consteble or chaar constablon kii tainaati ke aadesh diye the
 At the time of Gandhi's prayer, police used to be stationed in plain clothes in Birla Bhawan to keep an eye on every suspect
 haalanki police ne sochaa ki ehtiyaat ke taur par yadi prarthana sabha main hissaa lene ke liye aane vaale logon kii talaashi lekar unhen birla bhawan ke parisar main ghusane kii ijaajat di jaye to behatar rahegaa
 But Gandhiji did not like this idea of the police
 police ke diaiji level ke ek afasar ne bhi gandhi se is bare main baat kii or kaha ki unki jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he lekin gandhi nahin maane
 According to the FIR filed by Nandlal Mehta after Bapu's murder, the last word that came out of his mouth was 'hey Ram'
 lekin swatantrata senaanee or gandhi ke nijee sachiv ke taur par kaam kar chuke ve0 kalyanm kaa daawa he ki yah baat sach nahin he
 At the time of that incident, Kalyanam standing right behind Gandhi said that there was no question of any word coming out of Gandhi's mouth after being shot

html Artism An approach to art based on the 'art for art' recognition, which led to widespread debate in Europe during the 19th century
 kalawaad ko sahitya evam kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ke vilom ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This theory was formulated by Victor Couze in 1818
 iske anusaar kala kaa uddeshy kisi naitik yaa dharmik uddeshy kii prapti nahin balki swany apane purnataa kii talash he
 Art is the carrier of aesthetics, so it should not be judged as a test of utility
 samaaj, niti, dharm, darshan aadi ke niyamon kaa paalan kala kii svachhand tathaa swatah sfoort abhivyakti main baadhak hote hai
 According to Artists, artists are extraterrestrial beings, art objects of art and artistic pleasure are supernatural tasteful and social
 iske vipareet upyogetavaadi kala ko na keval samaaj kii manovritiyaan parivartit karke vaanchit disha kii ore agresharit karne kaa shashakt saadhan maanate hai, apitu use siddhant prachaar kaa sarvottam madhyam bhi bataate hai
 Utilitarians have accused the artisans of being narrow and subjective, saying they are mounted on a pneumatic horse
 kalavaadiyon ne upyogetavaadiyon par sthool saamaajikta kaa agrahi hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya or kaha, unhone hamen swarg dene kaa vachan diya tha, lekin diya he ruganalay
 There is also a third class of thinkers who consider the coordination of the individualism of artism and the socialism of utilitarianism beneficial
 kalavaadi drushtikon kii pratyakshapratyaksh satta europe main plato tathaa arestu se lekar aaj tak kisi na kisi rup main lagaataar milti he
 Plato, in his treatise 'republic', has given a system of nationalizing poets and artists; Because, in his view, the immense influence of imaginative artists and poets was undesirable ethically and socially
 arestu ne yadhyapi apane guru plato kii naitik evam saamaajik dharna kaa khule rup main khandan nahin kiya he, saath hi kala main naitik tatv tathaa upadeshaatmakataa bhi unhen amaanya nahin kiya he, to bhi prasiddh kalasmeekshak bujar ke matanusaar arastu ne hi pehle pahal kalashaastra ne nitishastra ko pruthak kiya or bataaya ki parishkrut anandanubhuti hi kavyakala athwa kala kaa charam lakshya hota he
 The famous thinker of Rome, Cicer, has determined decency and sublime to be the chief productions of art
 longinus ne apni kriti 'periipsus' main kala ko na keval shiksha or manoranjan se bhinn evam shreshth mana he balki use samprerana ke ucch dharaatal par pratishthit karke, uske swatantra moolyankan kaa paraamarsh bhi diya he
 According to Longinus, the main elements of poetry and art are sublime and sublimation of emotion is their main result which is directly related to the person as well as the society
 at: apane vaktavy or pratipaadan main longinus nishchit hi madhyamargi hai
 Dionysis and Demetrius Prabhriti Many other Roman thinkers have laid special emphasis on the stylistic aspect of poetry and art
 europe kii shastreey yaa clasical kala kaa pallavan adhikanshat: isai dharm athwa 'carch' ke sarankshan main hua
 Therefore, between the seventh and the 15th century CE, the Roman art that developed from Egypt to Russia, with Rome as the center, was ethically-religious-values-coordinated as a church dependent, so it was necessary to be objective and didactic and that is why There was only secondary accessory in it
 to bhi aisa nahin he ki ukt kaal kii kala main kalpana tathaa bhaawanaaon ke liye koi chhot thi hi nahin
 In contrast, religiously artists used to create high quality art without any external control or compulsion
 talsty kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal virdohi the
 Their lack of faith towards religion gives rise to artistic ideas and art is neither pleasurable nor beauty
 ve naitikta ke prati atyagrahi the or gandhi ji kii tarahat unka drushtikon sudhaarwadi tha
 Reformism is essentially utilitarianism
 at: talsty ke liye kala nishchit hi ek gaun saadhan maatr rahaa
 The great poet of Italy, Aligiari Dante, again reputed the sublime qualities and grand style in the field of art
 dante kaa prabhaav kuch hi din rahaa
 After this, the classical vision gradually came to be covered with romantic view
 falat: is samay kala sambandhi mulyon main baari parivartan hua
 The 17th century can be said to be quite important from the point of view of art
 iske dauraan france main navyashastravaad kaa udai hua
 But this too was no more than a newer version of medieval thought
 renesaan ke baad europe main madhyakaalin naitik mulyon kaa vighatan hona shuru hua jisase paramparawaadi tathaa swatantramulak vichaaron ke bich asthirataa kaa vaataavaran hi utpann nahin hua balki paraspar takaraav bhi hone laga
 The reason for this was the lack of a strong philosophy at this time
 san 1866 i
 ke lagbhag vividh saahitiyik evam kalasambandhi vaadon ke pravartan main agrahi desh france main 'l aart por l aart' sutarakathan saamne aayaa jiskaa angreji anuwaad 'art for arts sek' he or hindi main jise 'kala kala ke liye' vaakyansh se janaa jaataa he
 It is from here that the artistic ideology can be seen as a direct beginning
 amareeki chitrakaar james abot mecnil hvisler, jo aaajeevan france or england main karyrat rahaa, kalawaad kaa prabal samarthak bana
 It was that Ruskin, a noted English critic at the Grosswainer painting exhibition in 1877 AD, sharply criticized the Whistler's paintings, saying that the Whistler poured colorful cups on the faces of the audience through his paintings
 raskni ke is kathan par adaalat main mukadmaa shuru ho gaya jisamen hvisler ko antat: kshatipurti ke rup main ek fading mila
 Even then, there was debate between Ruskin and Hwisler about the purpose of art
 ruskin kala ko naitikta se alag-thalag bilkul swantatra evam swat:purna maanata tha
 Inspired by this, Hwisler, with all his power, enforced the 'kala Kala K' vote which reached the limits of extremism
 breadle, clive bel, roger faai tathaa george inness ityadi pramukh samalochak kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal poshak the
 Bradley explicitly declared in his treatise 'poetry for Poetry's Sec' that morality is the only external aspect of poetry
 at: kavita kii shreshthata ke liye use anivaary maananaa ekadam besujh hai
 Clive Bell considered the motif in the context of modern painting and in 1914 introduced the theory of 'significant Farm' which was revised by Roger Fi in 1920
 kroche ke abhivyanjanawad se kalawaad ko ek suspasht darshanik aadhaar praapt ho gaya
 On the basis of Kant's founding 'beauty has no external existence', Croche in his treatise called 'la Spirito' has given the power of 'inner wisdom' for aesthetics and states that both aesthetics and beauty are subtle mental pursuits
 
 saath hi varnyavastu tathaa abhivyanjana ke bich tathvik ekta hoti he
 Therefore, it is misleading to look at artisanal and objective aspects
 kroche ke anusaar kala mulat: ek aadhyatmik kriya he, isliye uski drushti main abhivyanjana ke atirikt kala ko koi anya uddeshy athwa prayojan nahin hota
 Not only this, Croche also considered art to be free from moral and academic limitations
 dekha jaae to kroche ke siddhant dwaara ek prakaar se upyogetavaadi manyata kaa khandan ho jaataa he, lekin ukt siddhant kala ke amoort vyapaar par hi lagu hota he, moort par nahin
 Kroche's art theory is not essentially anti-social because even if it is tangible, he does not consider art as social
 friid ke 'swapnavaad' se bhi kalavaadi drushti ko kaaphi bal mila
 In his book 'principles of Literary Criticism', IA Richard's, while denouncing the artistic vision on theoretical grounds, gave great importance to the remittance in poetry process and said that the power of poetry is not different from the rest of the world nor does the feeling of poetry The rest is different from the experience of the world
 is prakaar richards ne kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ko pun: pratishtha kii
 The rise of Marxism led to a rapid disintegration of artistic beliefs
 marks ne apane arthshaastra main kala ke prati upyogetavaadi drushtikon apanaaya or kaha ki kala janata ke liye, mukhyat: sainikon or shramikon ke liye hi he
 Stalin considered art and literature in Russia and Mao in China as the main means of propagating politics, and placed a curse on him with power
 maao ne 'prablems ov art and litarechar' sheershak apane paripatr main marks kii uparyukt sthapanaaon ke prati aasthaa vyakt kii he
 Marxist critic Codwell has also termed the artistic ideology as the result of a sickening attitude created by a purely bourgeois view
 marxvaadi kheme main tratski hi ek aisa vyakti he ja kala ke kshetra main raajnneetik party ke hastekshap ko anuchit maanata he
 In his treatise titled 'literature and Revolution', he has clearly stated, there is no need to order the party in the field of art
 yah thik he ki party ke kartavyon main kala kii raksha or uski sahaayta karnaa bhi he, lekin nettrutv us kshetra main aparoksh rup se hi ho saktaa he
 IP here With the study of physiology and psychology presented by scholars like Pavlov, it has finally been decided that art is as useful for the individual and society as other general physical material
 bhartiya sahitya main bhi alankaar, reeti, vakrokti aadi se sambandhit anek aise sampradaay rahe hai jinaki drushti main kalapaksh adhik mahatvapurn tha
 In the modern literature of Hindi, Premchand, Dinkar etc
 were utilitarian, then Prasad adopted a blissful vision which is much closer to artism
 agyeya, mahadevi verma aadi kalavaadi hai to acharya ramchandra shukla, dow hajariprasad dvivedi, doramvilas sharma aadi aalochakon kii drushti vishuddh upyogetavaadi he
 Dr

 One day the owner of the garden was sitting and listening to the story and taking Dora

 The king asked the queen, what kind of dora is tied? The queen said that this was the same Dora whom she had once broken by throwing

 He neither wrote abundantly nor did his literary efforts in poetry, drama or other fields have any special significance today, apart from essays and certain critical works, yet the influence of his serious personality was most small and large at that time
 The writers fell on him
