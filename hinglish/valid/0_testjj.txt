 Modern ECG monitors provide diverse filters for signal processing
 sabase aam samaayojan monitor mod or naidanik mod hai
 In monitor mode, the low frequency filter is adjusted to either 0
5 Hz or 1 Hz and the high frequency filter is adjusted to 40 Hz
 yah kritak niyamit hriday taal ke nirikshan ko simit karata he
 The high-pass filter helps to reduce the unstable baseline and the low-pass filter helps to reduce the noise with a power line of 50 or 60 Hz
 In the diagnostic mode, the high pass filter is adjusted to 0
05 Hz, which allows the accurate ST segment to be recorded
 nimna-paas filter ko 40, 100, yaa 150 hertz par samyojit kiya jaataa he
 As a result, the monitor mode performance of the ECG is more filtered than the diagnostic mode, because its passband is more thin

 16 disambar ko hi pakistani sena ne sarender kiya tha
 Retired Colonel Bibi Vats, who played a role in the Kargil War, gave 10 major reasons for India's victory and Pakistan's defeat
 1
 us vakt bharat kii leadership indira gandhi ke netritv main strang thi, jabaki pakistan main sainik taanashaah yahaya khan behatar faisle lene main utana sakasham nahin tha
 2
 Cohesion in political diplomacy, bureaucracy and military was better, whereas in Pakistan there was disintegration due to military rule
 3
 bharat ne yuddh se pehle rus ke saath samjhauta kiya tha, international level par bangladesh kii rifuji samasya ko joardaar dhang se uthaaya tha
 Pakistan was forgetful that the US and China would help it
 4
 pakistan kii madad ke liye america ne sevanth flit bede ko hind mahaasaagar main diego garsia tak bhej diya tha, lekin bharat ne rus se jo samjhauta kiya tha, uski vajah se bharat kii madad ke liye rus ne apni newclear sab marin bhej di
 This was in favor of India
 5
 bharat ne east pakistan main teji se war kar teen din main hi air force or neval wing ko tabah kar diya
 Due to this, paratroopers easily landed in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, which General AAK Niazi found after 48 hours
 6
 pakistan main disijan teking power sirf hair level par centrulij thi
 Because of this, it took time for any decision to come down
 is vajah se pakistan teji se koi stritji nahin bana paaya
 In India, Chief of the Army Staff Manekshaw gave the power to take decisions to both core commanders
 bhartiya sena teji se nirnay lekar hamale kar saki

 West Pakistan started 'crack Down' in East Pakistan

 Pakistan could not find out India's strategy till the end
 usne sochaa tha ki bharat kii sena east pakistan main nadiyon ko paar kar dhaka tak nahin pahunch paaegi or vah border par hi uljhe rahenge
 This proved to be his mistake
 bhartiya sena ne paratrupers kii madad se dhaka ko hi gher liya
 At the same time, with the help of Mukti Vahini, the Indian Army penetrated through the border of East Pakistan
 9
 pakistan main army, navy or airforce main koardination nahin tha
 This is the reason that the three could not act jointly, while the Indian Army was working in unison under the leadership of Field Marshal Manekshaw

 east pakistan main mukti vahini ke rup main jo sena gathit hui, vah pakistan kii sena se ladi or bhartiya sena ko rasta bataaya

 Psychiatrists are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain and psychiatric treatment is required for their treatment
 manovigyaan main hamaare liye asaamaanya or anuchit vyavhaaron ko manovikar kaha jaataa he
 They grow slowly
 manovikaron ke bahut se kaarak hai, jinamein anuvaanshikta, kamjor vyaktitv, sahansheeltaa kaa abhaav, baalyavastha ke anubhav, tanaavpurn paristhitiyaan or inkaa saamana karne kii asamarthy sammilit hai
 The situations that a person finds difficult to solve and cope with are called 'stress factors'
 tanaav kisi vyakti par aisi aavashyaktaaon va maangon ko thope detaa he jise puraa karnaa vah ati dubhar or mushkil samajhataa he
 Persistent failure to meet these demands creates mental tension in the person
 aaj ke samay main tanaav logon ke liye bahut hi saamaanya anubhav ban chukaa he, jo ki adhisankhya daihik or manovaigyanik pratikriyaaon dwaara vyakt hota he
 The traditional definition of stress focuses on the somatic response
 hens style ne 'tanaav' shabd ko khoja or isaki paribhaasha sharir kii kisi bhi aavashyaktaa ke aadhaar par anishchit pratikriya ke rup main kii
 The definition of Hans Shale's base is somatic and gives greater importance to the actions of hormones, which are secreted by the adrenals and other glands
 style ne do prakaar ke tanaavon kii sankalpana kii- The new approach to stress focuses on the role of assessment and interpretation of the situation in relation to the adjustment resources available to the individual

 a problem-focused policy uses a person's intellectual solutions to find solutions to stressful situations and often leads to an effective solution
 manobhaav kendrit niti dwaara tanaavpurn sthitiyon kaa saamana karte samay vyakti bhaavnaatmak vyavhaar ko pradarshit karata he jaise chillaanaa
 Although, if a person is unable to cope with stress, then he / she tends to resist-oriented diplomacy, different behaviors can arise if these are adopted repeatedly

 Clinical and Statistical Manual on Psychiatry) has been published by the American Psychiatric Association, which mentions a wide variety of mental disorders
 manovigyaan kii jo shakha vikaron kaa samaadhaan khojati he use asaamaanya manovigyaan kaha jaataa he
 You might be surprised to know that children can also become psychotic

 Some of these careful-absence hyperactive disorders are found in which the child is not careful or focused or he behaves very agile
 or swalin vikaar jisamen baccha antarmukhi ho jaataa he, bilkul nahin muskuraataa or der se bhashaa sikhta he
 If a person feels scared, scared or anxious without any specific reason, then it can be said that the person is suffering from anxiety disorder
 vyagrata vikaar ke vibhinn prakaar hote hai jisamen chintaa kii bhaavana vibhinn roopon main dikhaai detii he
 Some of these disorders are caused by extreme and unconditional fear of something and obsessive-compulsive disorder where a person keeps thinking the same thing again and again and repeating their actions
 ve vyakti jo manodasha vikaar ke anubhavon se grasit hote hai unke manobhaav dirghakaal tak pratibandhit ho jate hai, ve vyakti kisi ek manobhaav par sthir ho jate hai, yaa in bhaavon kii shreniyon main adal-badal karte rahete hai
 For example, whether a person remains depressed for a few days or remains depressed on one day and remains happy the next day, his behavior has nothing to do with the situation
 is tarah vyakti ke vyavhaarik lakshanon par ashrith manodasha vikaar do prakaar ke hote hai - Depression is a mental state that is characterized by sadness, lack of interest and lack of pleasure in daily activities, restless sleep and loss of sleep, less hunger, no weight loss, or more hunger and weight gain, laziness, feeling guilty , Shows disqualification, helplessness, despair, Shani in establishing concentration and signs of negative ideology towards herself and others
 yadi kisi vyakti ko is tarah ke bhav nunatam do saptaah tak rahen to use avsaadagrast kaha ja saktaa he or us ke upachaar ke liye use sheeghra naidanik chikitsa pradaan karwaanaa aavashyak he
 In today's time, some diseases have become very common such as low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes etc
 vaise to ye sab shaareerik bimaariyaan hai parantu ye manavaigyanik kaarnon jaise tanaav va chintaa se utpann hoti hai
 So psychosomatic disorders are psychological problems that exhibit physical symptoms, but are psychological due to this
 vahiin manodaihik kii avadharana main man kaa arth maanas he or daihik kaa arth sharir he
 Conversely, somatic disorders are disorders whose symptoms are physical but their biological causes are not revealed
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi koi vyakti petdard kii shikaayat kar rahaa he parantu tab bhi jab uske us khaas ang arthath pet main kisi tarah kii koi samasya nahin hoti
 After a traumatic event, a person is unable to recognize his / her past existence, past events and the people around them
 naidanik manovigyaan main is tarah kii samasyaon ko vighatnsheel vikaar kaha jaataa he, jisamen kisi vyakti kaa vyaktitv samajadhut va samaaj se pruthak ho jaataa he
 Disruptive amnesia is a class of disruptive psychosis in which a person is usually unable to recall important personal information after a stressful event
 vighatan kii sthiti main vyakti apane naye astitv ko mahasoos karata he
 The second category is disruptive identity disorder in which a person loses his memory, while he starts imagining a new existence
 anya varg vyaktitwalope vikaar he, jisamen vyakti achaanak badlaav yaa bhinn prakaar se vicitra mahasoos karata he
 a person feels as if he has abandoned his body or his movements suddenly become mechanical or dreamlike
 haalanki vighatan manovikar kii sab se gambheer sthiti tab utpann ho ti he jab koi ekaadhik vyaktitv manovikar va vighatan astitv manovikar se grast ho
 In this situation diverse personalities appear at different times in the same person
 aapane sadak par kabhi kisi vyakti ko gande kapadon main, kooday ke aasapaas pade asvachh bhojan ko khate yaa phir ajeeb tareeke se baatcheet yaa vyavhaar karte hue dekha hoga
 They have a weak orientation in terms of person, place and time

 peshwa madhavrao pratham maratha samrajya ke chauthe purnadhikaar praapt peshwa the
 He is recognized as the greatest Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, who, despite being a minor, was able to recover the lost power and prestige of the Marathas in the Third War of Panipat due to his amazing foresight and organization-ability
 11 varshon kii apni alpakaaleen shasnavadhi main bhi aarambhik 2 varsh grihakalah main tathaa antim varsh kshay rog kii pidaa main guzar jane ke baavjood unhone na keval uttam shashan-prabandh sthapit kiya, balki apni doordarshita se yogya saradaaron ko ekajute kar tathaa naanaa fadanvis evam mahadji scindia donon kaa sahyog lekar maratha samrajya ko bhi sarvocch vistaar tak pahunchaa diya
 Madhavrao was born on 16 February 1745 AD as the first child of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao and his wife 'gopikabai'
 unka ek chota bhai bhi tha narayanrav
 On 9 December 1753, 'madhavrao' was married to a girl named 'ramabai'
 'peshwa balaji bajirao' ne apni mrityu ke purv hi yah nirnay kar diya tha ki unke baad alpavayask hone ke baavjood unka bada putr 'madhavrao' hi peshwa kii gaddi par baithegaa tathaa uske vayask hone tak uskaa chachaa raghunatharav peshwa kii ore se rajkaaj sanbhaalega
 According to this decision Madhavrao was taken to Satara to meet Chhatrapati after the completion of Shraddhakarya after the death of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao
 vahiin 20 july 1761 ko chhatrapati ke dwaara madhavrao ko 'peshwa-pad' ke vastra pradaan kiye gayi
 After his return from Satara, Raghoba took over the reins of governance as the protector of the young Peshwa
 sakhaaraam baapu dewan niyukt kiye gayi
 Peshwa's mother, Gopikabai, had also seen and experienced a lot of Peshwai's various tasks and woes since the time of the great Peshwa Bajirao
 unhen raaghobaa dwaara sara adhikaar apane haath main le liya janaa acha nahin laga tathaa unhen peshwa ke bhavishya kii chintaa hone lagi
 He started opposing Raghoba's monopoly
 is prakaar puna ke darbar main grih kalah aarambh hua
 The warlords had two sides
 ek gopikabai kaa samarthak tha or doosraa raaghobaa kaa
 Prominent among Gopikabai's supporters were Baburao Fadnavis, Trimbakrao Pethe, Anandrao Raste, Tatya Ghodpade, Gopal Rao Patwardhan, Bhawanrao Pratinidhi etc
 raghunatharav ke samarthakon main pramukh the sakhaaraam baapu, chinto vitthal rairikar, mahipatrav chitanis, krishnarav parasnis, aabaa purandare, vitthal shivdev vinchurkar, naroshankar raajbahadur aadi
 The natural sympathy of the general public, including many prominent people, was towards the child Peshwa and so when Raghoba and Sakharam Bapu felt that their opposition was increasing, they resigned from their posts with the aim of forcing the child Peshwa and Gopikabai
 Started threatening to give
 unka maananaa tha ki unke bina rajkaarya sambhav hi nahin ho paaegaa or tab majabuuran gopikabai ko jhukna padegaa
 But Gopikabai, while introducing the cleverness, talked about appointing Baburao Fadnavis and Trimbakrao Pethe at their places keeping them both apart
 isse raaghobaa atyant cruddh hokar nizaam ko peshwa ke viruddh bhadakaane laga
 With this, he started collecting his own army
 alpavayask hone ke baavjood madhavrao main swaabhaavik doordarshita thi or ve vivek sampann the
 He tried to convince and appease Raghoba and also agreed that he would work according to his advice in future
 parantu, raaghobaa swayan peshwa pad par asin hona chahta tha isliye usne anuchit maangen rakhin
 In this context, Govind Sakharam Sardesai wrote that: apane manonukool peshwa dwaara maang puri na kiye jane par raaghobaa ne apni nijee sena tathaa nizaam kii sahaayta lekar yuddh ched diya
 On November 7, 1762, a battle took place on the banks of the Ghod River, 30 miles southeast of Pune, but the decision was not made
 peshwa vahaan se sena hataakar bhima nadi ke kinare aalegaanv chale gayi
 Raghoba, chasing with the Nizam's army, reached there and suddenly attacked Peshwa on 12 November, for which the Peshwa was not ready
 parinamswaroop unki ghor paraajay hui
 For the best purpose of not allowing this civil war to go on for a long time, the Peshwa himself surrendered by going to the camp of Raghoba
 raaghobaa ne upar se yah dikhaaya ki use pad yaa satta kaa moh nahin he, parantu gupt rup se peshwa tathaa unki mata ko ek prakaar se najarband kar diya
 a guard of two thousand soldiers was appointed to keep a close watch on the Peshwa
 isi prakaar gopikabai ko bhi shanivarwara main hi kadi suraksha main rakhaa gaya
 To strengthen his position, Raghoba removed all the experienced and reliable Peshwa employees and reinstated his people
 raaghobaa kii pratihinsa se bachane ke liye anek pramukh sardaar nizaam ke yahan chale gayi
 In Pune, the dissatisfaction with Raghoba continued to grow
 nizaam ne apane bhai salavatajang ko padchyut kar apane samay ke chatur kootneetijna vitthal sundar ko apana dewan banaaya tha
 When Vitthal Sundar saw that the Maratha kingdom had been weakened due to the defeat of Panipat and subsequent house arrest, he suggested the Nizam to invade Pune
 nizaam ne peshwa ko likhaa ki bhima nadi ke purv kaa sara praant tathaa pehle usase liye gayi uske sabhi kile usko saunp diye jaaen
 The Maratha chieftains whose fiefs have been taken away should be returned
 uske dwaara niyukt vyakti ko dewan banaaya jaae tathaa peshwa darbar kaa sara rajkaaj uski salaah se kiya jaae
 Talking of such audacious and degrading steps taken by the Nizam, a wave of awareness ran across all the Maratha chieftains and everyone united in this nation-crisis
 sakhaaraam baapu tathaa anya saradaaron ne bhi raaghobaa ke atyaacharon se trast hokar hyderabad gayi hue samast anbhavi puraane saradaaron ko samajha-bujhaakar waapas bula liya
 Peshwa Madhavrao, who is still under house arrest, at the time, forgetting his insults, gave full insight to his prudence and foresight and agreed to face the Nizam
 ek vishaal sena lekar nizaam pune kii ore badha tathaa malharav holkar evam damaji gaekwad jaise senanayakon ke saath maratha sena bhi taiyaar hui
 However, this army could not be so powerful that it could face the Nizam's army in the open field
 atah ek ore nizaam pune kii ore bad rahaa tha to duusari ore peshwa raaghobaa ke saath aurangabad kii ore bad rahe the
 Both of them committed terrible looting in both the territories
 pune ke pramukh logon ke saath vahaan kii janata ko bhi bhaagna padaa
 The Nizam's army looted Pune
 pune kii kuch pramukh hastiyon ne jisamen naanaa fadanvis bhi the, lohgarh ke kile main sharan lee
 Gopikabai also had to elope with Narayanrao and took refuge in Sinhagad
 dhire-dhire nizaam ke sabhi maratha sardaar usase dur hone lage tathaa peshwa kii shakti prabal hone lagi
 There was a fierce battle between the two armies at the place called Rakshabhuvan and the Nizam was badly defeated
 uske dewan vitthal sundar bhi is yuddh main maare gayi
 The treaty was signed on 25 September 1763 AD and all the territories that Raghoba had given to the Nizam selfishly, were surrendered by the Nizam to the Peshwa
 is sandhi ko aurangabad kii sandhi kaha jaataa he
 Madhavrao's foresight and might were fully introduced in this war and his reputation among the Maratha chieftains greatly increased
 panipat kii paraajay ke kaaran maraathon kii khoyi hui pratishtha kuch had tak is vijay se punah praapt ho gayi
 Home discord lasting for two years ended in a way and the Peshwa became full power and took over the administration
 samast shasnadhikaar apane haath main lekar peshwa ne yogya saradaaron ko punah upyukt padon par behaal kiya
 Bhawanrao was re-elected
 balaji janardan bhanu ko fadanvis pad par niyukt kiya gaya tathaa peshwa ne sabhi saradaaron se uttam sambandh bana liye
 He also made Mahadji Shinde his ally
 is samay maratha rajya ke rangamanch par nayi umr kii teen vibhootiyon kaa udai hua
 In this context, Sardesai wrote that: panipat main maraathon kii paraajay ke baad mysore main haidadli ko apana prabhaav-vistaar karne kii swaabhaavik chhot mil gayi thi
 He was also not satisfied with establishing power over Mysore and Karnataka and dreamed of being the ruler of a vast empire
 usne ek badi sena ekatrit kar maraathon ke rajya par akraman aarambh kiya
 Peshwa Madhavrao himself led the Maratha army and repulsed Hyder Ali three times
 1770 se 1772 ke july tak chale tisare akraman main aarambhik 6 maheene tak swayan peshwa abhiyaan main upasthit rahe parantu baad main aswasth ho jane ke kaaran trimbakrav pethe ko senanayake banaakar swayan pune waapas aa gayi
 Hyder Ali was defeated in the Battle of Moti Talab on 7 March 1771
 peshwa kii ichha haidadli ko gaddi se hataakar purv hindu raja ko rajya saunpane kii thi, parantu raaghobaa ne peshwa ke adhikaar main kami rakhane ke uddeshy se aisa na hone diya : After conquering the battle of 'rakshasabhuvan', Raghoba was silent after Madhavrao took over all the power in his hand but was constantly looking for an opportunity for rebellion
 peshwa banane kii apni mahatvakanksha ko vah dabaa nahin paaya tathaa nagpur ke bhonsle kii sahaayta se usne madhavrao ke viruddh vidroh kar diya
 In front of the Peshwa, now there is no way left except the attack on Raghoba
 antat raaghobaa ko parrast kar madhavrao ne shanivarwara main hi unhen band kar diya taaki vah punah utpaat na khadaa kar sake
 The Maratha kingdom in northern India was often destroyed as a result of the defeat at Panipat
 dilli, agra, doaab, bundelkhand, malwa aadi sthanon ke chote-chote shaasha maratha satta kaa puri tarah se ant karne ke praytn main lage hue the
 Madhavrao Peshwa made a strong effort to regain power over his lost state of North India
 1761 isvi main jaipur ke raja madhav singh ko malhaar raav holkar ke dwaara parrast karvaa kar rajputon par maraathon kii dhak punah jamaayi gayi
 The Peshwa also sent two generals named Visaji Krishna along with Tukojirao Holkar and Ramchandra Ganesh to North India under the main heroism of Mahadji Shinde
 mahadji scindia kii sooyeeboojh tathaa prabal parakram ke kaaran jat tathaa ruhelon kaa daman hua, farrukhabad ke nawab bangash tathaa bundelkhand ke shaasha to parrast hue hi, mahadji ne angrejon ke sangrakshan main elahabaad main apane durdin kaat rahe mughal badshaah shahalam ko bhi mukt kara liya tathaa dilli le jaakar unhen punah singhasanacin karvaa diya
 Delhi was again dominated by the Maratha power and with this Mahashji's Yashosuriya also dived into the sky
 badshaah shahalam ne mahadji ko anek oopaadhiyon ke atirikt vakil e mutalak kii oopaadhi bhi pradaan kii jiskaa adhikaar badshaah se kuch hi kam hota tha
 Thus the Maratha empire reached its highest expansion due to Peshwa Madhavrao's prudent vision and organization capacity
 apane alpakaaleen shashan main bhi bade-bade kaary karne vaale peshwa madhavrao ke antim 2 varsh bade kashtpurna beete
 He had developed a tuberculosis disease, due to which he used to stay on the bed while suffering from pain
 kabhi-kabhi pidaa itani teevr ho jaati thi ki ve apane sevakon se apana ant kar dene ko kehane lagate the
 But despite suffering so much, his understanding was not dimmed and he remained concerned for the bright future of the Maratha kingdom till the last moment
 unhone raaghobaa ko bhi mukt karke apane paas bula kar apane chote bhai narayanrav ko unhen saunpte hue unki raksha karne kaa vachan dene ko kaha
 Raghoba vowed that they would always help and protect them
