 byran nelson tathaa woods donon ke yug main, "mekking da cat" ko ek pe chack praapt karne ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya
 However, in Nelson's day, only players who came in the first 20 in a competition won a paycheck, while in Woods's day, only those players who reached the lowest score within 36 holes won a paycheck
 kai golf vishleshkon kaa tark he ki woods vastav main nelson ke lagaataar cat chinh se aage nahi gaye, tark diye ja rahe hai ki toornament kii 31 pratiyogitaaon main jinamein woods ne muqabla kiya wo "no-cat" pratiyogitaayen thi, matlab puri pratiyogita ke dauraan, unke 36 holon tak ke score kii parvaah kiye bina, maidan main saare khilaadiyon ko muqabla ke liye adhipatrit kiya gaya
 These analysts argue that the final number of continuous cuts made by Woods will be 111 and Nelson's 113
 haalanki, jinamein nelson ne khelaa uname se kam se kam das toornamenton main aadhunik samay ke kats nahi the; jo ki, in pratiyogitaaon main sabhi khilaadiyon ko pichle 36 holon se muqabla karne kii guarantee di gayi thi
 For example, The Masters, a 36-hole cut that did not begin until 1957, was the PGA Championship match that was played until 1958, and it is unclear whether the three other contests in which Nelson competed were in Nelson Whether or not he did 36-holes
 Therefore, these analysts remove the "36-hole cut no" contests from both cut line measurements, and are scored at 103 by Nelson and 111 by Woods
 toornamenton main jiname nelson ne muqabla kiya or jisame 36-hole ke kats nahin the, keval sheersh 20 khilaadiyon ko ek pechack praapt hua jabaki in pratiyogitaaon main sabhi khilaadiyon ko pichle 36 holon se muqabla karne kii guarantee di gayi thi
 Therefore, in these no-cut competitions, Nelson is still placed in the top 20, so the 113 cuts made by Nelson reflect its 113 top finishes
 woods ne lagaataar 21 baar sheersh 20 me jagah praapt kii tathaa, jin 31 no-cat pratiyogitaaon main ve khele, usamen se unhone 10 jiti or keval 5 baar sheersh 10 ke rup main samaapt kiya
 Woods himself, along with others, argues that the two lines cannot be compared, as the variation of tournament structures in the two eras is great for making any meaningful comparisons
 1970 or 1976 ke bich jaik niklos dwaara banaaya gaya 105 lagaataar kats cat rekhaon par ek adhik upyukt tulana he, jo 1976 ke world open ke saath samaapt hua

 Therefore, the government released him

 1938 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan haripura main hona tay hua
 Prior to this session, Gandhi chose Subhash for the post of Congress President
 yah congress kaa 51 vaan adhiveshan tha
 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili
 He announced that now that India has a golden opportunity, it should intensify its campaign for liberation
 8 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh ke prati party kaa rukh tay karne ke liye subhash ko vishesh aamantrit ke rup main congress kaary samiti main bulaayaa gaya
 He also reiterated with his opinion that if the Congress cannot do this work, the forward block will start a war against the British Raj on its own
 agle hi varsh july main kalakatta sthit halwat stambh jo bharat kii gulaami kaa pratik tha subhash kii youth brigade ne ratorat vah stambh mitti main mila diya
 Subhash's volunteers uprooted each brick of his foundation
 yah ek pratikatmak shuruyaat thi
 Through this, Subhash had given the message that as he has mixed this column in the dust, in the same way, he will also play brick by brick of the British Empire
 iske parinamswaroop angrej sarkaar ne subhash sahit forward block ke sabhi mukhya netaaon ko kaid kar liya
 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police
 sharadbabu ke bade bete shishir ne unhe apni gaadi se kolkata se dur gomoh tak pahunchaaya
 They reached Peshawar after catching a frontier mail from Gomoh railway station
 peshawar main unhen forward block ke ek sahakaari, miyaan akbar shah mili
 Mian Akbar Shah met him with Bhagatram Talwar of Kirti Kisan Party
 bhagatraam talwaar ke saath subhash peshawar se afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ore nikal pade
 In this journey, Pathan and Subhash named Bhagatram Talwar Rahmat Khan became his deaf and dumb deaf
 pahadiyon main paidal chalate hue unhone yah safar puraa kiya
 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him
 aakhir main arlando mazonta naamak italian vyakti banakar subhash kabul se nikalakar rus kii rajdhani masco hote hue germany kii rajdhani berlin pahunche
 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay kinhin bhi do deshon kii nausenaon kii pandubbiyon ke dwaara nagarikon kii yah ekmaatr adla-badali hui thi
 This Japanese submarine brought them to Padang Port in Indonesia
 purvi asia pahunchakar subhash ne sarvapratham vayovruddh krantikari rasbihari bose se bhartiya swatantrata parishad kaa netritv sanbhaala
 Rasbihari voluntarily handed over the leadership of the Freedom Council to Subhash in Singapore's Edward Park
 japan ke pradhanmantri general hideki tojo ne netaji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar unhen sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan
 21 oktober 1943 ke din netaji ne singapore main arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind kii sthapana kii
 He himself became the President, Prime Minister and War Minister of this government
 is sarkaar ko kul nau deshon ne manyata di
 Netaji also became the chief commander of the Azad Hind Fauj
 azaad hind fouj main japani sena ne angrejon kii fouj se pakade hue bhartiya yudhbandiyon ko bhartee kiya tha
 The Rani Regiment of Jhansi was also formed for women in Azad Hind Fauj
 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 Japanese general Shodei, Pilate, and some others aboard the plane were killed
 netaji gambheer rup se jal gayi the
 He was rushed to Taihoku military hospital where he succumbed
 karnal habiburrahman ke anusaar unka antim sanskaar taihoku main hi kar diya gaya
 In mid-september, their bones were collected and placed in the Rankoji temple of Tokyo, the capital of Japan
 bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar se praapt dastauez ke anusaar netaji kii mrityu 18 agast 1945 ko taihoku ke sainik aspataal main raatri 21
00 baje hui thi
 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country
 faijabad ke gumnami baba se lekar chhattisgarh rajya main jila raigarh tak main netaji ke hone ko lekar kai daawey pesh kiye gayi lekin in sabhi kii pramanikta sandigdh he
 In Chhattisgarh, the case of Subhash Chandra Bose went to the state government
 parantu rajya sarkaar ne ise hastkshep ke yogya na maanate hue maamle kii file hi band kar di
 The Calcutta High Court has ordered the formation of a special bench to hear the demand to make the intelligence documents related to the mystery of Netaji's disappearance public
 yah yachika sarkari sanghathan indiaj smil dwaara daayar kii gayi he
 Many others including the Union of India, National Advisory Council, RAW, Intelligence Department, Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Defense Secretary, Home Department and the Government of West Bengal have been made defendants in this petition
 hiroshima or nagasaki ke vidhwans ke baad saare sandarbh hi badal gayi
 After surrender, Japan kept groaning under America's feet for four-five years
 yahi kaaran tha ki netaji or aaazaad hind sena kaa romaharshak itihaas tokio ke abhilekhaagaar main varshon tak padaa dhul khaataa rahaa
 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity
 angrejon ke dwaara kiye gayi vidhivat dushprachaar tathaa tatkaaleen pramukh raajnneetik dalon dwaara subhash ke virodh ke baavjood saare desh ko jhakzor denevaale us mukademe ke baad matayen apane beton ko ‘subhash’ kaa naam dene main garv kaa anubhav karne lageen
 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this
 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country
 jahaan swatantrata se purv videshi shaasha netaji kii samarthy se ghabaraate rahe, to swatantrata ke uparant deshi sattadhish janamanas par unke vyaktitv or kartrutv ke amit prabhaav se ghabaraate rahe
 Swatantraveer Savarkar organized a conference of revolutionaries after independence and placed Netaji's oil painting on the seat of the Speaker
 yah ek krantivir dwaara duusare kranti vir ko di gayi abhootpurv salaami thi
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha
 This book became very famous
 unki aatmakatha yadhyapi apurna hi rahi, lekin use purna karne kii unki abhilaashaa rahi thi, jiskaa pataa mul pandulipi ke pratham prishth par banaayi gayi yojana se spasht roopen chalata he
 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke sankalan evam prakaashan kaary se aarambh se hi sugat bose bhi jude hue the or antim do khandon kaa prakaashan dow0 shishir kumaar bose ke dukhad nidhan ke kaaran mukhyatah sugat bose ke hi sampadan main hua
 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that like Mahatma Gandhi, in the context of Netaji too, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed
 china va bharat vishwa ke do bade vikasshil desh hai
 Both have done many things for the peace and development of the world
 china or uske sab se bade padosi desh bharat ke bich lambii seemaa rekha he
 For a long time, the Chinese government has been giving great importance to the development of its relations with India
 is varsh kii pehali april ko china va bharat ke rajanyik sambandhon kii sthapana kii 55veen varshganth he
 The next year after the establishment of new China in 1949, India established diplomatic relations with China
 is tarah bharat china lok ganraajya ko manyata dene vaala pratham garasmajwaadee desh bana
 In the last 55 years after the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India, china-india relations have gone through many stages
 unka vikaas aam taur par sakriy va sthir rahaa, lekin, bich main mithe va kadavi smritiyaan bhi raheen
 In these 55 years, there were many diversions in the relations between the two countries
 aaj ke is kaarykram main ham china va bharat ke raajnneetik sambandhon kaa simhavlokan karenge
 Professor Ma Ja Li is the head of the South Asia Research Center of the Modern International Relations Research Institute of China
 ve tees varshon se china va bharat ke raajnneetik sambandhon ke anusandhan main lage hai
 Mr
 Ma Ja Lee has divided the last 55 years of india-china relations into five parts
 un ke anusaar, 1950 ke dashak main china va bharat ke sambandh itihaas ke sab se achche kaal main the
 The top leaders of both countries then made several visits to each other and there was a lot of movement among their people
 donon deshon ke bich tab ghanishtha raajnneetik sambandh the
 However, in the 1960s, relations between China and India entered into a cold period
 is ke baavjood donon ke maitreepurn sambandh kai hajaar varsh puraane hai
 Therefore, this winter was like a short wave in a historic long river
 70 ke dashak ke madhya tak ve sheet kaal se nikal kar phir ek baar ghanishtha hue
 As china-india relations progressed, the ambassadorial efforts of the governments of the two countries once again restored ambassador-level diplomatic relations between the two
 1980 ke dashak se 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak china va bharat ke sambandhon main garmaahat aa chuki thi
 However, in the year 1998, with the release of five missiles in the relations between the two countries, the coldness once again came
 par yah turant donon sarkaron kii koshish se varsh 1999 main bhartiya videshmantri kii china yatra ke baad samaapt ho gaya
 Now china-india relations are getting closer step by step
 idhar ke varshon main china-bharat sambandhon main nirantar sudhaar ho rahaa he
 There has been increased movement between senior officials from China and India
 bharat sthit bhootpurv chini rajdoot chyo kong ne kaha, ab china-bharat sambandh ek naye kaal main pravesh kar chuke hai
 In the years that followed, there was increased movement between the leaders of China and India
 varsh 2001 main purv chini netaa lee fung ne bharat kii yatra kii
 In 2002, former Chinese Prime Minister Xu Rong Ji visited India
 is ke baad, varsh 2003 main bhartiya pradhanmantri vaajapei ne china kii yatra kii
 He signed the Declaration of Principle of china-india Relations and Declaring Cooperation with Chinese Prime Minister One Cha Pao
 is ghoshnaptr ne jaahir kiya ki china va bharat ke dwipaksheeya sambandh apekshaakrit paripakv kaal main pravesh kar chuke hai
 This Declaration also clarified both important bilateral problems and regional issues on both sides
 ise bhavi dwipaksheeya sambandhon ke vikaas kaa nirdesan karne vaala mile ke pathar kii haisiyat vaala dastavej bhi mana gaya
 The relations between China and India are growing further on the old foundation
 videsh niti par china va bharat bahudhruviya duniya kii sthapana karne kaa paksh lete hai, prabhutvvaadi va bal kii raajnneeti kaa virodh karte hai or kisi ek shaktishaalee desh ke vishwa kii police banane kaa virodh karte hai
 How to deal with the current disputes in international relations and how to treat them between countries, these two problems stand before different countries
 china va bharat maanate hai ki unke dwaara pravartit kiye gayi shantipurna sashastitv ke paanch siddhant sanyukt raashtra ke charter ke un lakshyon tathaa siddhanton ko pratibimbit karte hai, jinka duniya ke vibhinn deshon dwaara paalan kiya janaa chahie
 Five principles of peaceful coexistence i
e
 Panchsheel were introduced by China, India and Myanmar in the month of June 1954
 panchasheel china va bharat dwaara duniya kii shanti va suraksha main kiya gaya ek mahatvapurn yogadan he, or aaj tak donon deshon kii janata kii jabaan par he
 The main theme of these principles established in relation to the relations of the countries - respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, do not attack each other, do not interfere in each other's internal affairs and equality and mutual Peaceful coexistence should be maintained on the basis of profit
 ye siddhant vishwa ke anek deshon dwaara sweekaar kar liye gayi hai or dwipaksheeya sambandhon par hue antarrashtriya sammelnon va dastavejon main darj kiye gayi hai
 In the discussion of Panchsheel's history, former Chinese Ambassador to India Mr
 Chen Ray Shan said, Before the Second World War, very few countries in Asia and Africa had attained independence
 lekin, dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad, upniveshvaadi vyavastha bhang honi shuru hui
 India and Myanmar gained independence and later China too
 asia main sab se pehle swatantraaa praapt karne vaale desh hone ke naate, unhen deshon kii prabhusatta va pradeshik akhandla kaa kaayam rahanaa bada aavashyak laga or unhen vibhinn deshon ke sambandhon kaa nirdesan karne ke siddhant kii zarurat padi
 Therefore, the leaders of these three countries together called for Panchsheel
 panchasheel ne antarrashtriya sambandhon kii saidhantik va yatharth kaaryvaayiyon main rachanaatmak yogadan kiya
 Former Indian President Narayanan discussed the importance of Panchsheel in this way
 panchasheel kaa aaj bhi baari mahatv he
 It has been the guiding standard for settling relations between countries for a long time
 ek shantipurna duniya kii sthapana karne ke liye panchasheel kaa karyavyan karnaa atyant mahatvapurn he
 It is clear from the history and international reality that Panchsheel's vitality is very strong
 use vyapak janata dwaara sweekaar kiya ja chukaa he
 Countries adopting different social systems accept the ideology of Panchsheel
 logon ne maan liya he ki panchasheel shanti va sahyog ke liye laabhadaayak he or antarrashtriya kanoonon va maapdandon se purna rup se mail khaataa hai
 Changes are happening in today's world
 panchasheel kaa prachaar-prasar aaj kii kuch samasyaon ke hal ke liye bahut laabhadaayak he
 Therefore, Panchsheel is still the basis of a peaceful world order
 us kaa aaj bhi baari arth va mahatv he or bhavishya main bhi rahegaa
 Searching for peace and development is the same desire of the people of the present world
 panchasheel kii shanti va vikaas kii vichaardhaara ne antarrashtriya sambandhon ke swasth vikaas ko aage badhaayaa he or bhavishya main bhi vah ek shantipurna, sthir, nyaaypurna va uchit nayi antarrashtriya vyavastha kii sthapana main ahm bhoomika adaa karegi
 In order to further develop the relationship between the two countries, former Indian President Narayanan in 2000, during a state visit to China, suggested the convening of a forum of eminent personalities from India and China in talks with former Chinese President Chiang Jin Min
 did
 is prastaav par shri chyang ja min ne sakaaratmak pratikriya di
 Both governments confirmed the establishment of this forum
 manch ke pramukh sadsy, donon deshon ke raajnneetik, aarthik, saamaajik, vaigyanik va takanic tathaa saanskrithik aadi kshetron ke jane maane vyakti hai
 a member of the forum, Mr
 Chyeo Kang explained the main objective of the forum in this way, the main objective of this forum is to submit suggestions for the development of bilateral relations by eminent persons from different regions of both countries and to advise the government
 yah donon deshon ke bich gaiyrsarkari awajahi kii ek gatividhiyon main se ek bhi he
 It has been held four times from September 2001 to the end of 2004
 iske anek sujhaavon ko donon deshon kii sarkaron ne sweekrut kiya he
 This forum will continue to contribute in the form of a government consulting institution
 haalanki idhar china va bharat ke sambandhon main baari sudhaar hua he, to bhi donon ke sambandhon main kuch ansulajhi samasyaayein rahi hai
 The biggest problems between China and India are the border dispute and Tibet
 china sarkaar hameshaa se tibet kii samasya ko bada mahatv detii ai he
 In 2003, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China and issued a joint manifesto with Chinese Prime Minister One Cha Pao
 ghoshnaptr main bharat ne aupchaarik rup se kaha ki bharat tibet ko china kaa ek bhaag maanata he
 In this way, the Government of India, for the first time, openly highlighted its stand on the problem of Tibet through a formal document, which received praise from the Chinese government
 is ke alaava, china va bharat ke bich seemaa samasya bhi lambe arase se ansulajhi rahi he
 To solve this problem, China and India held talks in several phases from December 1981 and achieved some progress among them
 varsh 2003 main purv bhartiya pradhanmantri shri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne china kii safal yatra kii
 China and India signed the Memorandum of Understanding and Principle of china-india Relations
 china va uske padosi deshon ke rajanyik sambandhon ke itihaas main aise gyaapan kam hi jari hue hai
 In this memorandum signed by the Prime Ministers of the two countries, both countries adopted more bold policies, including appointing special representatives to negotiate the border problem and find a political solution to the border problem
 china or bharat ke is ghoshnaptr main yah bhi spasht kiya gaya he ki tibet swytt pradesh china kaa ek abhinn or akhand bhaag he
 Consultation is going on at the level of special representatives of China and India to solve the border problem
 varsh 2004 main china or bharat ne seemaa samasya par yah vishesh pratinidhi vaarta vyavastha sthapit kii
 Former Chinese Ambassador to India Chyo Kang said, "we should depart from a forward-looking stance towards the problem left behind by history
" china sarkaar ne seemaa samasya ke hal kii sakriy rukh apanaai he
 China hopes that the appropriate and justifiable methods accepted by both should be discovered through friendly dialogue, in accordance with the spirit of mutual goodwill and trust
 vishwaas he ki jab donon paksh aapasi vishwaas, sulah va riyaayat dene kii abhilaashaa se prasthaan karenge to china-bharat seemaa samasya ke hal ke tareekon kii khoj kar hi lee jaaegi
 At this time, China and India are engaged in their peaceful development
 21veen shatabdi ke china va bharat pratidwandi hai or mitra bhi
 There is widespread agreement in both on international affairs
 aankade bataate hai ki sanyukt raashtra sangh main vibhinn sawaalon par hue matdaan main adhikansh samay, bharat or china kaa paksh samaan rahaa
 Now both countries have the same goal of economic development and improving the standard of living of the people

 They are used in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and also in some parts of Central and East Asia
 is parivaar kii kisi lekhan pranali ko brahmi-aadhaarit lipi yaa bhartiya lipi kaha ja saktaa he

 Brahmi-based scripts stem from the Brahmi script
 isa purv teesri sadi main ashok ke rajyakaal main brahmi kaa prayog kaa sakshya miltaa he, unhone is lipi kaa istemaal samraji shilalekhon ke liye kiya tha
 But in addition to this, recently, a few inscribed inscriptions written in Sinhala Brahmi on pottery dating to the sixth century BCE have been found at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka
 isa purv chauthi yaa paanchavi sadi ke tamil brahmi ke namoonay bhi bhattiprolu va anyatra mili hai
 The Gupta script came from northern Brahmi during the Gupta dynasty and was the mother of many handwriting in the medieval period, among them Siddham, Sharda and Nagari
 siddham lipi buddha dharm ke liye kaafii mahatvapurn thi kyonki kai sutara isi main likhe gaye the or aaj bhi japan main siddham sulekh kii kala kaayam he
 The script and other scripts were produced from Southern Brahmi and then many scripts were made in Southeast Asia
 teesri sadi main bhattiprolu buddha dharm kaa ek bada kendra tha, yaheen se buddha dharm purvi asia main failaa
 The modern Telugu script is derived from the Bhattiprolu script or 'kannada-telugu script', it is also called 'ancient Kannada script' because of its similarity to Kannada
 shuruyaat main kuch chote badlaav hue, usase jo lipi bani use ab tamil brahmi kehete hai, isamen kuch anya bhartiya lipiyon ke mukaable kahin kam akshar hai kyonki isamen alag se mahapraan yaa saghosh vyanjan nahin hai
 Later, the impact of the text led to the emergence of Vettuthu which resembles the modern Malayalam script
 19veen or 20veen sadi main or bhi badlaav hue taaki chapai or tankan ke liye suvidha ho or is prakaar samakaleen lipi saamne ai
 Gerry Ledyard envisages that the Hangul script, which is used to write Korean, actually stems from the Mongol Fagsapa script, which originated from the Brahmi family through Tibetan
 kuch visheshtaayen, jo sambhawatah har lipi main na ho, is prakaar hai: Below are the tables for comparison of several major Indian scripts
 ekal swar har stambh main baayein taraf pradarshit hai or us lipi ke "k" vyanjan main maatra ke taur par dayee taraf hai
 Assamese brahmi se upji lipiyaan
 The remains of the oldest known writings date back to the 3rd century BC, by which time many regional editions of the Brahmi script had already been made
 brahmi lipi kii banaavat paanchavi sadi isvin ke baad se or adhik vividh hoti gai or madhya yug main isane lagaataar kai nai lipiyon ko janm diya
 The main division of ancient times was between northern and southern Brahmi

 It is being held in Bangladesh, and started on 6 January 2018
 north zone maujuuda champion hai Any work which has the structure of rules and which is done to get pleasure or sometimes to provide education, is called sports or sports
 khel kii sabase pehali visheshta he ki khel aamod-pramod he
 The game is fun
 koi bhi aisa kaaryaklap jisase bacchon ko anand miltaa he, khel he
 Game is the natural action of the child
 bhinn-bhinn aayu varg ke bachche vibhinn prakaar ke khel khelte he ye vibhinn prakaar ke khel bacchon ke sampurna vikaas main sahaayak hote hai
 The types of games include exploratory, structural, fantasy and rules games
 khelon main saanskrithik vibhinnataayen bhi dekhi jaati hai
 Sports promote children's physical, cognitive, emotional, social and moral development, but parents' negative attitudes towards and play are severely affected
 atah yah anivaary hai ki shikshak or mata-pita khel ke mahatv ko samajhen
 The common belief about the game is that it is the opposite of work
 khel ek aisi sthiti he jisamen log koi upyogi yaa vishisht kaam nahin kar rahe hote hai
 There is also a thinking about the game that it is enjoyable, free and effortless
 yah drushtikon chote bachche ke vikaas main khel ke mahatv ko nakaarta he
 Over the years, many psychological theorists have begun to emphasize the importance of sports in the development of a child
 inhone khel ke anek pakshon par bal diya he or bataaya he ki khel kaise manovaigyanik prakriyaaon ko prabhavit karata he
 In the eyes of psychologists, sports is a way of freeing and rejuvenating from the past
 yah khoj, pahal or swatantraaa he
 Sports fulfill man's psychological needs
 tathaa vah manushya ko saamaajik kaushalon ke vikaas kaa bhi avasar detaa he
 According to Piaget, games also play a big role in the development of children's mental abilities
 pehle charan main baccha vastuon ke saath samvedan praapt karne va kaary sanchaalan karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In the second stage, the child starts using objects as a symbol to form imaginations
 antim charan main kaalpanik bhoomikaaon ke khelon kii tulana main baccha niyambaddh khel main sanlagn rahata he
 Games help in developing logical ability and school related skills
 vaigotski uske vichaaron se prerit shodhakartta yah nahin maanate ki khelon main umr ke saath sahaj parivartan ho jaataa he
 They consider guidance from adults and social contexts as important for this
 unke anusaar bacchon ke khel ke str ko vayask badha sakate hai
 According to Vygotsky - Games with complex roles give children a better and safer opportunity to organize their behavior than they do in real situations
 is tarah khel bachche ke liye nikat vikaas kaa kshetra banaate he
 Children's concentration, memory, etc
 work at a higher level during the game than in the school situation
 khel main bachche kii nai vikasman dakshataayen pehle ubhar kar aati hai
 In sports plays, the child works according to his inner thoughts and is not bound by what he sees as tangible
 yaheen se usamen amoort chintan va vichaar karne kii taiyaari hone lagati he
 It is also a preparation for writing because the word in writing is not like an object, it symbolizes its idea
 jitani umr tak khel main jatil or vistrut bhoomikaaon va bhashaa kaa prayog hota he vah bachche ke vikaas ke liye ek pramukh gatividhi bana rahata he
 This condition may be less in children up to 10–11 years old
 dhire-dhire iskaa mahatv kam hone lagata he
 Teachers can make the game more prosperous by giving them enough time and resources to play, suggesting topics, resolving conflicts
 arikson or anna frid ke anusaar khel apurna rah gayi ichchhaaon kaa sthanapann or ateet kii ghaatak ghatnaon se mukti or punerjeevan kaa ek rasta he
 The psychoanalytic method emphasizes the socially emotional aspects of sport
 khel ke dwaara baccha mata-pita ke saath apane maansik dvandvon or vivekahin, bhayon kaa samaadhaan karata he
 a child overcomes the fear of darkness by playing demon-monster, a child punishes his doll for a perceived violation of a rule in the same way as a parent punishes him
 arikson kii drushti main priskool charan ke dauraan khel ek bachche ke liye khoj, pahal or swatantraaa kaa rasta he
 Psychologically, sports are a way of guiding aggression through medium in a depressive experience
 yah ateet ke liye ek pratikriya or ateet kii ghatnaon kii ore lautne kii prakriya kaa ek tantra bhi he
 Partell and other theorists view sports as a form of social exchange that enhances and mirrors the child's developing ability to engage in collaborative tasks with classmates
 khel ke aarambhik charnon main sahpaathiyon ke saath aadan-pradaan lagbhag nahin yaa bahut thodaa hota he or us samay saamaajik kaushalon ke prayog main asamarthta bhi dikhti he
 The ability to see from one side to another, co-ordination in different roles, conversations about the game's content and ability to resolve disputes seems to be developing
 khel main kalpit or naatakeey sthitiyaan saamanytah saamaajik aadan-pradaan kii adhik paripakv vidhiyaan maani jaati hai
 Some researchers have also looked at sports from a social point of view
 dhakka-mukki ke antargat sab tarah ke kushti or 'pakado to jane' koti ke khel shaamil kiye ja sakate hai
 Like social games, push-free games also have roles
 bachche jigyaasu prakruti ke hote hai
 While playing, children get an opportunity to touch objects, observe them carefully and investigate the surrounding environment and this gives them answers to many questions arising in their mind
 khel kriyaaon ke madhyam se ve aam ghatnaon ke ghatit hone ke kaaran bhi samajhane lagate hai
 We help children learn by giving them opportunities to play at will
 khel bacchon ko khoj karne or uske dwaara swayan seekhney kaa avasar praapt hota he
 Search means finding out about events and objects themselves
 khel main balika ko apni ruchi ke anusaar kriyaayein chunane kii swatantraaa hoti he is kaaran vah aise khel chunati he jo uske liye na to bahut saral hon na hi bahut kathin parantu chunauteepurn hon
 Thus she learns the things she is prepared to learn
 is prakaar seekhney kii prakriya boj na banakar aanandadaayak ho jaati he
 At the same time, children learn through activity in play
 aisa karne se sankalpanaaon ko adhik acchhee tarah samajha ja saktaa he
 If children are told about a concept only verbally and are not given the opportunity to do it themselves, then they will not understand it so well
 yah tathy ki 'bachche kuch karne se hi sikhte he' kaa arth yah nahin he ki paalankarta kii usamen koi bhoomika hi nahin he
 The need for a follower first is to help the children to explain their discovery
 dwitiya, paalankarta bachche kii khoj ko vistrut kar sakati he
 Children learn new when they are allowed to play with the game material and encouraged to do something themselves
 ant main, paalankarta ko sadaiv is baat kii pratiksha nahin kerani chahie ki bachche swayan kuch bhi karen
 He should organize such situations for children through which children can learn new
 jab paalankarta aisa kar rahi ho to use bacchon kii ruchi or sangyanatmak vikaas ke str ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 In this way, the follower can help the children to learn about colors, shapes, numbers, seasons, different types of sparrows and plants etc
 through the game
 khel dwaara bachche choti, lambii or thigani, halaki or baari jaisi sankalpanaaon se bhi parichit hote hai
 Just as the follower has to organize activities for cognitive development, in order to encourage development in other areas, the follower should also organize activities according to development
 khel main bachche kalpana dwaara alag-alag bhoomikaaye nibhaate hai
 In doing so, his intelligence and behavior are according to the person he is playing
 is kaaran ve un vyaktiyon ke vichaar or bhaawanaaon ko bhi pradarshit karte hai
 Drama is an integral part of children's play
 khel main balika vaastaviktaa se cat or bahut kuch srujanaatmak karti he
 a broken plate becomes the table for a three-year-old girl and a spacecraft for a ten-year-old boy
 maachis ke dibbon kii pankti railgadee ban jaati he or is railgadee se khelte hue bachche jangal se guzarane nadi paar karne or dakaiton se ladane kaa naatak karte hai
 You will be surprised to see that the rail is running on the road and not on the track
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki khel yatharth hi darshaae
 The game develops imaginations and helps children cope with daily situations
 shaareerik or kriyaatmak kaushalon kaa vikaas abhyaas karne par nirbhar karata he
 Play is an action that provides children with ample practice opportunities
 ek maan jab chaar maheene ke shishu ke aage ek jhunjhuna rakh detii he
 The baby's attention is drawn towards Jhunjuna and he tries to reach it by turning from his back on his stomach
 yah karne ke liye mansapeshiyon kaa samanvay jaruri he
 In an effort to reach the tingling again and again, the baby gets an opportunity to eat mud and slowly he does it easily
 bachche jab eenton kii ek pankti par chalane kii koshish karte hai, diwaar phandate hai, seedhi chadhate hai, jhulon main latakate hai, daudane ke khel khelte hai, cycle kii sawari karte hai to unki bahut mansapeshiyon kaa samanvay badhata he
 In sports, small muscles of children develop by digging pits in the ground, making flower necklaces, drawing and coloring them
 bachche khel-khel main bolnaa sikh jate hai
 It is clear that to know the language, it is necessary for them to be able to hear and speak the language
 paalankarta ke saath vinodshil kriyaaon main bacchee ko bhashaa sunne ke bahut avasar milte hai jo use bolne ke liye prerit karte hai
 When the girl is about nine months old, she makes many voices like "ga ga ga", "bay bay bay", "ma ma ma", "mam mam"
 inamen se kuch vayaskon kii bhashaa kii shuruuaat hai
 During this interaction, the girl learns to speak between different sounds
 yah kshamta use baad main ‘‘abba‘‘ or ‘‘ammaa‘‘ jaise shabdon main bhed karne madad karti he or vah unhen alag-alag shabdon ke rup main pahchaan paati he
 Children also begin to understand various shapes such as square, round, straight and curved lines which later help them to identify different letters
 khelte hue bachche yah dekhte hai ki kaala or laal vrutt yaa chota or bada vrutt sabhi golakaar hai
 This will help them understand that the letter 'A' remains 'A' whether it is at the beginning or the end of the word
 khel main vah pehle or baad, baayein or daayen, upar or neeche jaisi sankalpanaaon kaa arth sikhti he jo ki likhnaa or padhanaa seekhney ke liye ati aavashyak hai
 You have noticed that games are helpful in functional development which is necessary for learning to write
 ham jaanate hai ki bachche sahajata se vahi sikhte hai jinamein unki ruchi hoti he
 This is also true for learning to write and read
 kahaniyaan sunne se bacchon main swayan unhen padhane ke liye ichha jaagrit hogi or vah padhane or likhane ke liye prerit honge
 If the girl does not know how to write and the follower pressures her to write, then possibly the process of learning to write should be made into a game in which the girl puts small stones on the 'A' written on the ground, walks on the outline or ' If 'A' is written by adding the letters of the letter 'A', then it will gradually become familiar with the outline of 'A'
 is prakaar use anand bhi aayega or vah bina dabaav ke likhnaa sikh jaaegi
 The girl begins to recognize the mother during these interactions when the mother bathes, dresses, sleeps, and takes care of all her other needs
 uskaa maan se lagaav bhi badhata he
 This is the baby's first social connection, which also has a profound effect on her future relationships
 jivan ke praarambhik varshon main bacchee apane haath-pairon se tathaa aasapaas kii vastuon se khelti he
 This lets the baby know that his body is different from the surrounding objects
 aisa anubhavon ke dwaara uski apane bare main dharna viksit hoti he
 She begins to understand that mother will come to her when she cries, when she laughed, mother will also laugh and pick her up in her lap
 jaise-jaise balika badi hoti he vah anya bacchon ke saath khelti he
 Playing with them learns to share things, follow rules, wait for their turn
 is prakaar vah anya logon ke drushtikon ko dhyaan main rakhana or unako mahatv dena bhi sikhti he
 Children often imitate adults while playing
 is prakaar se upyukt vyavhaar or un bhoomikaaon ko sikhte hai jo ki unhen bade hokar nibhaani hongi
 They get information about different kinds of functions, festivals, perceptions in playing interaction
 khel kriyaayein bacchon ko harsh ullas, krodh, bhay or dukh vyakt karne kaa avasar pradaan karti hai
 In the game, you have the freedom to do anything you want, provided that it does not harm anyone
 khel un bhaawanaaon or sanvegon ko vyakt karne kaa mauka detaa he jo anya sthitiyon main abhivyakt nahin kiye ja sakate
 For example, while playing the role of the father in the game, the girl can ask the other child to follow his orders
 aisa vah anya sthitiyon main shaayad na kar sake
 She can shout loudly while playing a fight scene, banging things around which she is not usually allowed
 khel dwaara avyakt bhavanaayen ubhar kar saamne aati hai
 That is why sports are treatment or therapy for children who do not show normal emotional response according to the situation
 khel bacchon ke vikaas main madad karke unhen bhavishya kii bhoomikaaon ke liye taiyaar karte hai
 The concepts learned in sports help in reading and writing skills and ability to participate in group sports and later in school adjustment
 atah khel aupchaarik shiksha kii taiyaari main sahaayak hota he
 The game also nurtures the mindset of asking questions and exploring
 jaise-jaise bachche nai chijen sikhte hai or unamem nipunata praapt karte hai vah apane bare main aashwast hote hai
 This growing self-confidence prepares them to accept challenges

 prakaash jha ne jab ajay devgan or kaajol ko lekar film:dil kya kare banaai, tabhi se unako apni film ke liye ek sthaayee nayak mila
 Gangajal and his experiences of kidnapping were very good with Ajay Devgan and perhaps that is why he is also an important part of the politics film
 film ke saath diggaj nirdeshak ke rup main prakaash jha kaa naam judaa hona hi badi baat nahin balki film kii puri charitra-suchi par drushtipaat karnaa film ke bare main anumaan lagane ke liye aavashyak he
