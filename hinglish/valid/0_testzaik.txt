 "although pop music is often considered more inclined towards the singles charts, chart music has not only contained pop music but has also always contained songs from various sources, including classical, jazz, rock and new songs, while one The appearance and development of pop music as a genre has usually been isolated

 However from the late 1950s, pop became known as a particular type of non-classical music, usually as songs sung by artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Abba, etc
 "grove Music Online It is also written that "in the early 1960s, the term pop music was literally compared to the beat music of England, whereas in America it was equated with 'rock and roll'

 From about 1967 onwards, the term became increasingly used instead of rock music; With this division, both words started gaining general importance
 While rock began to aspire to the authenticity and scope of popular music, pop was more commercial, accessible and contemporary

 According to Grove Music Online, "the pop genre derived from the West spread across the world, creating a commonality in global commercial music culture, whether they merged with local genres or created a distinctly different identity
 Some non-westerners like Japan The flourishing pop music industry dedicated to Western style flourished in countries, and it has been in large numbers for many years everywhere except America

 aapekshikta siddhantvishisht aapekshikta kaa parichay Specific relativity theory or specific theory of relativity Albert Einstein, in his paper on electrostatics in moving objects, gave a physical theory of measurement in the inertial directive system proposed in 1905
 galileo gallily ne abhigruhit kiya tha ki sabhi samaan gatiyaan saapekshik hai or yahan kuch bhi nirpeksh nahin he tathaa kuch bhi viraam avasthaa main bhi nahin he, jise ab galileo kaa aapekshikta siddhant kaha jaataa he
 Einstein extended this theory, according to which the velocity of light is absolute and fixed, a phenomenon that was recently visible in michelson-morley's experiment
 unhone ek abhigruhit yah bhi diya ki yah sabhi bhautik niyam, yantriki va sthiravaidyutiki ke sabhi niyamon, wo jo bhi hon, samaan rahete hai
 There are a large number of results of this theory that have been observed experimentally, such as time dilation, length contraction, and symmetry
 is siddhant ne nishchar samay interval jaisi avadharana ko badalakar nishchar dik-kaal interval jaisi nai avadharana ko janm diya he
 This theory gave the revolutionary mass-energy relation e = mc2, where c is the velocity of light in vacuum, this formula is a joint derivative of other physical laws, including the two postulates of this theory
 aapekshikta siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyan newtoneey bhautikee ke parinaam ko sahaj hi ullekith karte hai, visheshtah jab prekshaniy vastu kaa veg, prakaash ke veg kii tulana main naganya ho
 According to specific relativity theory, the velocity of light c is not merely the velocity of a hypothesis, such as the velocity of electromagnetic radiation, but is a fundamental characteristic of the integration of macromolecules and time as a period of time
 is siddhant kaa ek parinaam yah bhi he ki aisi koi bhi vastu athwa kan jiskaa viraam dravyaman shunya nahin he kisi bhi paristhiti main prakaash ke veg tak twarit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The reason for calling this theory specific is that this principle applies only to inertial reference systems
 iske kuch varshon pashchaat saamaanya aapekshikta naamak vyapak siddhant diya gaya, jo vyapak nirdeshaankon par kaary karata he or isse gurutvkarshan samajhane main bhi sahaayta milti he
 —albert Einstein: Autobiographical Comments ainstin ne do moolbhoot prastaav die jo sabase adhik sahi prathit hote hai, jo tatkaaleen yantriki or vidyutgatiki ke niyamon kii paripurna vaidhata kii andekhi karke die gayi
 This motion depended on the velocity of light and was independent of the physical rules and inertial reference system
 unhone 1905 main apni pratham prastuti main in abhigrihiton kaa ullekh kiya The derivation of specific relativism depends not only on the above two identities but also on the various implicit hypotheses including the isotropy and symmetry of the macro, freedom of rod measurement and clocks from the history of our past
 vishisht aapekshikta par 1905 main ainstin kii mul prastuti ke anusaar, vibhinn parivarti vyutpan vidhiyon dwaara praapt vibhinn abhigruhit die ja chuke hai
 According to the specific relativity principle, no directional system is absolute
 prithvi par sthir nirdesh tantra jadtviya nirdesh tantra nahin he kyonki yah prithvi kii ghurnan gati ke saath yah bhi ghurnan karata he
 The inertial motion mechanism is also inertial at a fixed velocity relative to an inertial direction system
 atah nirpeksh jadtviya nirdesh tantra kii pariklpana niraadhaar he
 Suppose the directive system s has the time coordinates and the directive system s ′ has coordinates
 tab lorenj roopantaran ke anusaar in nirdeshaankon ko nimna sambandhon dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he : Where lorenj gunak he or c nirvaat main prakaash kaa veg he or nirdesh tantra S′ kaa veg v x-aksh ke samaantar he
 The y and z coordinates are not affected; Only the x and t coordinates move
 yahan x-aksh main kuch vishesh nahin he, sthaanantaran y athwa z akshon par bhi lagu ho saktaa he, athwa kisi bhi disha main jo disha gati kii disha ke samaantar or lambavat ho
 a zodiac sign that remains undervalued in Lorenz transformation is called Lorenz Neischer
 bhinn nirdeshaankon main lorenj roopantaran or iske vyutkram likhane par, jahaan ek ek ghatana ke nirdeshaank or hai tathaa duusari ghatana ke nirdeshaank or tab unke antaraal nimna tarah se paribhaashit kiye jate hai : So we can write vishisht aapekshikta ke parinaam lorenj samikarnon se vyutpann kiye ja sakate hai
 These transformations and specific relativities also give different results from the notable results when the relative velocity values are equal to the velocity of light
 prakaash kaa veg maanav nirmit kisi bhi samagam se bahut adhik he jo vishisht aapekshikta dwaara kuch prabhaav praapt kiye gayi
 Examples such as symmetry, time dilation, length contraction have been proved experimentally
 do bhinn ghatnaayen jo ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra main samakshanik hai, ho saktaa he duusare jadtviya nirdesh tantra main sthit prekshak ke liye samakshanik nahin hai 
 First equation of Lorenz transformation in different coordinates yahan yah spasht he ki jo ek nirdesh tantra s main samakshanik hai, aavashyak nahin kii anya nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi samakshanik hon 
 If these events are isotropic in the directive system S, then they will be congruent in the other directive system s ′
 ek prekshak se duusare prekshak tak kinhin do ghatanon ke madhya samay nishchar nahin he, balki prekshkon kii gati par nirbhar karata he Suppose a clock instruction is at rest in mechanism S
 is ghadi ke do bhinn tik-tik ko Δx = 0 dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The time between these two ticks is measured in both systems, for this the first equation is given as follows: isse pradarshit hota he ki do tik ke madhya kaa samyaantar nirdesh tantra jisamen ghadi viraam avasthaa main thi kii tulana main nirdesh tantra jisamen ghadi gatisheel thi main adhik tha
 With the help of time extension, we can understand many physical hypotheses such as the rate of loss of muons generated by the cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere
 ek prekshak dwaara kisi vastu kii vimaa kaa maapan anya prekshak dwaara prekshit maapan se bhinn ho sakati he
 Similarly, in the considered linear pause, the instruction system s is aligned towards the x-axis
 is tantra main rekhak kii lambaai Δx likhi jaati he
 The measurement of the length of the line in the s 'reference system in which the clock is moving where x ′ is measured at the ends of the rod is paralleled in the S' mechanism

 If according to the observer in the instruction mechanism S, an object is moving with velocity u towards the x axis, then the motion object observed by the observer located in the direction mechanism s ′ which is moving along the x-axis and v velocity relative to the instruction mechanism s The velocity u 'is where: anya nirdesh tantra main prekshit : It is worth noting here that objects which are moving with the velocity of light in the instruction system S, then that object will also be moving with the velocity of light in the direction system s ′

 ek baccha jo train ke andar baitha he ne ek gend purv disha kii or train ke saapeksh veg u se phenkaa
 In orthodox physics, the velocity of the ball of the observer placed at rest on the tracks will observe u = u ′ + v in the east direction, while the specific relativity is not true; Rather, the velocity of the ball is given in the east direction by the second equation: u = /

 anya aapekshik prabhaavon ke vipareet, yah prabhaav ati nimna vegon par bhi sarthak he, jaisaa gatisheel kanon ke prachakran main dekha ja saktaa he
 As the speed of an object approaches the velocity of light in the observer's perspective, its relative mass also increases, making it more difficult to accelerate, all of which appears to be from the observer's directive system
 viraam avasthaa main kisi vastu kii urja kaa maan mc2 hota he jahaan m vastu kaa dravyaman he
 By the law of energy conservation, in any action, the decrease in mass should be equal to the increase in its kinetic energy after the action
 isi prakaar, kisi vastu kaa dravyaman ko isaki gatij urja ko isamen lekar badhaaya ja saktaa he
 In addition, Einstein also wrote at least four papers, making self-empirical arguments for equivalence - referring to the above-derived Lorenz transformations and explaining specific relativities
 dravyaman-urja samatulyata vishisht aapekshikta kaa ek parinaam he
 In renewable mechanics, where energy and momentum are different physical quantities, they form a quadrature direction in specific relativity and relate the time component to the macro component
 viraam avasthaa main sthit ek vastu, urja dravyaman chatursadish hota he : iskaa samay ghatak urja he or anya teen samshti ghatak hai jo shunya hai
 The energy-momentum quadrature will change when the direction mechanism changes with the Lorenz transform with a low velocity v in the x-axis direction
 saveg kaa maan urja va veg ke gunanfal ko c2 se vibhajit karne par praapt maan ke saamaan hoga
 For example, the new mass of an object, which is proportional to the momentum and velocity for low velocities, will be equal to e / c2

 He further hypothesized that the energy and frequency of the light would be transformed by the same Doppler displacement component, which he had already proved true by the Maxwell equations, the subject of the first paper published in 1905 by Einstein, "whether the inertia of a body depends on that energy Does? "was

 According to other authors, this statement was quite inconclusive as it was based on some underlying assumptions
 ainstin ne sweekaar kiya ki vishisht aapekshikta par unke 1907 ke aalekh main uski vyutpati par vivaad hue
 There he realized that it is problematic to rely on the Maxwell equations for approximate energy-mass reasoning

 For the emission of electromagnetic waves, the movement of a charged particle is sufficient and it is definitely work, hence it is the emission of energy

 It can also be easily thought that the traveler may be able to reach only a few solar systems that are located 20–40 light years from Earth
 lekin yah ek galat parinaam he
 Because the hypothetical spacecraft can travel hundreds of light years during the active 40 years of a pilot according to the hypothesis of time-span
 yadi ek aisa antarikshayan bananaa sambhav ho paaya jiskaa twaran 1g ho, to ek varsh se bhi kam samay main prithvi se lagbhag prakaash ke veg ke saamaan veg se gatisheel prekshit hoga
 Due to the expansion of time, his life extension will increase with the instruction system located on the earth, but the clock traveling with him will not change

 The 5 year excursion journey observed by the traveler will be equivalent to 61⁄2 years of Earth and 6 light years will decide

 For this expansion reason, a muon that is moving at almost the same velocity as the light c is c × pause is observed far beyond the half-age distance

 If event a occurs before event b in this reference system, then event a will occur before event b in all reference systems
 yah dravya ke liye sambhav he ki vah ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par gati kare, atah yahan ek kaarantv sambandh sthapit ho jaataa he
 The gap AC in the picture is macro-homogeneous, meaning that here an instruction mechanism is such that events a and c occur at the same time, only the macro is different
 yahan par aise nirdesh tantra bhi praapt kar sakate hai jinamein A, c se pehle ghatit hoti he or nidesh tantra jinamein C, a se pehle ghatit hoti he
 If it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship that certain events would occur between a and C, then the paradox of causality would be the result
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi a kaaran tha or c prabhaav he to kuch nirdesh tantra aise bhi hai jinamein prabhaav kaaran se pehle ghatit hua
 Although this is not contradictory in itself, it can be demonstrated that the speed of light can transmit itself to the ghost of its own instruction system at a faster rate
 kaaranta virodhabhash kaa signal bhejkar nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he yadi or keval yadi purv main koi signal nahin mila tha
 Therefore, if the causality is preserved, then no information or matter can move faster than the velocity of light as a result of specific relativity
 tathaapi, kuch vasteen prakaash ke veg se bhi teji se gati karti hai jaise : sthaan jahaan bijli kii chamak ke kaaran kirane badal ke nichle hisse se takaraati he to us samay yah kiran prakaash ke veg se bhi adhik gati se duuri tay kar sakati he jab yah shighrata se mudati he
 Without taking into account the causality, there are many more powerful reasons here
 The speed of light is prohibited by specific relativity
 udhaaharan ke liye ek niyat bal aseemit samay ke liye ek vastu par lagu kiya jaye to nimna vyanjak kaa bina seemaa ke samakalan karne par f = dp / dt saralata se samveg praapt kiya jaataa he lekin yah keval isliye kyonki p = m γ v { \ displaystyle p=m \ gamma v \ ,} anant kii or agrasar hota he jaise-jaise v { \ displaystyle \ ,v}, c kii agrasar hota he
 For an observer who is not quick, this is exemplified although the inertia of the object increases, so a small acceleration is produced under the influence of the same force

 Theoretical and experimental surangan studies propounded by Günter Nimtz and Petrissa Eckley incorrectly claimed that under special circumstances the signal could move at a speed greater than the velocity of light

 According to Nimtz and Eckley, this over-illumination process violates only Einstein causality and specific relativity but not primitive causality: hyper-fluorescent communication is not the result of any kind of time travel

 The 4-dimensional Minkovsky ensemble is used in specific relativities; - This is an example of a time period
 minkovesaki dik-kaal maanak trivim eucalidia samshti ke bahut samaan prathit hoti he, lekin samay ke saath isamen kranthik parivartan aa jaataa he
 The differential line in the three-dimensional space is defined as ds jahaan dx = trivim samshti main avakal alpaansh hai
 In Minkowski's geometry, the derivative coordinate x0 over time is over-dimension, so the distance differential is jahaan dx = chaturvim dik-kaal main avakal alpaansh he
 This suggests a deeper theoretical insight: the special relativity is comparable to the normal rotational symmetry over time, corresponding to the rotational symmetry in the Euclidean complex
 eucalidian samshti kii tarah eucalidian doorik kaa bhi upyog hota he atah dik-kaal minkovesaki doorik ko upyog karata he
 Originally specific relativity is seen as the "dormancy of the downtime" when it is seen in "some inertial instruction system"
 vishisht aapekshikta kii sabhi samikarnon va prabhaavon ko minkosaki dik-kaal kii ghurnan samamiti se vyutpan kiya ja saktaa he
 The actual form of the above "ds" depends on the distance and the choice of x0 coordinates
 samay nirdeshaank ko samshti nirdeshaank ke sadrush banane ke liye, ise kaalpanik kii tarah upyog kiya jaataa he : x0 = ict 
 According to Missner, Thorne, and Wheeler, a deeper understanding of both specific and general relativities is ultimately derived from Minkowski's distance study and that the impermeable Euclidean distance time coordinates take x0 = ct instead of ict
 kuch lekhak x0 = t kaa upyog karte hai jahaan c ke gunak ko anyatra samahit kar lete hai; udahaaran ke liye, samshti nirdeshaankon ko c se vibhajit kiya jaataa he athwa c±2 ke gunak ko doorik pradeesh main prayukt karte hai

 When we increase it in three squares, this amount is exemplified in the quadrilateral cone: atah This null duality-cone represents a point in the macro as one-dimensional
 yah jab ham taron kaa adhyayan karte hai or kehete hai ki "is taare se aaptit prakaash jo main ab dekh rahaa hoon vah amuk varsh purana he", ham is bindu ko vimaa ke rup main dekhte hai : ek ashakt geodesic he

 In the cone - "t" field means receiving information from the point and sending the point information to the + "t" area of the cone

 Equations of specific relativity can be written in express variable form
 kisi ghatana kii dik-kaal main sthiti pratiparivarti chatursadish dwaara di jaati he jiske ghatak nimna hai : We define x0 = ct so that the dimensions of the time coordinates are the same as the distance, as are the other dimensions; Hence, time and time are equally related, the vertices are used for the reflex index, not for their power and the footprints are variable indices that range from zero to three, such that the quadrature of the scalar region लिखा is written: jadtviya nirdesh tantron main nirdeshaank roopantaran lorenj roopantaran λ dwaara die jate hai
 For a particular state of motion when it is in the direction of the x-axis: jo x va ct nirdeshaankon ke madhya abhivardhan matrix he, jahaan μ' panktiyon ko tathaa ν sthambh kaa suchak he or It can be interpolated for velocity in any direction and can also include forward rotation, see the topic of Lorenz transformation for more information

 He is also famous by the name of Purna Pragya and Anandatirtha
 ve tatvvaad ke pravartak the jise dwaitvaad ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Dualism is one of the three major philosophies of Vedanta
 madhwacharya ko vaayu kaa tritiy avatar mana jaataa he 
 Madhavacharya was the pioneer of his time in many ways, he has gone against the prevalent practices many times
 unhone dwait darshan kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He wrote a commentary on the Brahmasutra of Dvaita philosophy and also wrote an independent text 'anuvayakhyana' for logical confirmation of the lecture of his Vedanta
 shrimadbhagavadgita or upanishdon par tikaayen, mahabharat ke taatpary kii vyakhya karanevaala granth mahabharatatatparynirnay tathaa shrimadbhagwatpurana par tikaa ye inke anya granth he

 He was well-versed in the Vedas and Vedangas and retired at a young age
 puja, dhyaan, adhyayan or shastracharcha main inhone sanyas le liya
 He received his education from Acharya, a follower of Shankara Matha, Achutpreksh, and after making a discussion with the Guru, he formed his own separate opinion, which is called "dvaita darshan"
 inke anusaar vishnu hi paramatma hai
 Like Ramanuja, he supported Sri Vishnu's practice of amalgamating his limbs with signs of armaments, conch, chakra, mace and padma
 desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main inhone apane anuyaayi banaae
 Established the temple of Krishna in Udupi, which became a pilgrimage center for all his followers

 But these texts are full of exaggeration, miracles and incredible incidents due to the author's reverence for Acharya
 at: inke aadhaar par koi yathatathy vivaran madhwacharya ke jivan ke sambandh main nahin upasthit kiya ja saktaa
 Shri Madhvacharya developed his dualism theory from the departed scriptural texts
 yah `sadvaishnav ́ bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki yah shri ramanujacharya ke shri vaishnavatv se alag he
 Mr
 Madhwacharya studied the 'panch Bhide', which is also called the 'extreme Bhed Darshanam'
 uski paanch visheshtayen hai : Classification of the 'utmost bhed darshanam' in substance form has also been done in this way: swatantra vah he jo purna roopen swatantra he
 Which is God or eternal truth
 lekin jeevatma or jagat bhagwaan par ashrith hai
 That's why God controls them
 paramatma swatantra hai
 Therefore their classification is impossible
 ashrith tatva sakaaratmak evam nakaaratmak rup main vibhajit kiye jate hai
 Positives can also be classified into conscious and unconscious
 achetan tatva ko paribhaashit karne ke pehle madhwacharya swatantra or ashrith ke bare main bataate hai jo sansar se nity mukt hai
 According to this ideology, 'vishnu' is independent who is the prudent and the controller of the world
 unki shakti lakshmi hai jo nity mukt hai
 We can find Vishnu in many forms of arithmetic and avatars
 usee prakaar atyant ashrith lakshmi bhi vishnu kii shakti hai or nity bhautik sharir liye hi kai rup dhaaran kar sakati hai
 He is beyond suffering
 unke putr brahma or vaayu hai
 The word 'prakriti' means p = beyond + Kriti = the confluence of the universe
 madhwacharya ne sristi or brahm ko alag mana he
 According to him Vishnu is the doer of the material world
 bhagwaan prakruti ko lakshmi dwaara shashakt banaate hai or use drishy jagat main parivartit karte hai
 Nature is the physical cause of physical objects, bodies and organs
 prakruti ke teen pahaluon se teen shaktiyaan aavirbhoot hai : lakshmi, bhu or durga
 Avidya is also a form of nature that hides the divine from the soul
 madhwacharya ji kaa vishwaas he ki prakruti se bani dharti maaya nahin, balki paramatma se pruthak satya he
 It is not the same change as the curd hidden in milk, nor the form of God
 isliye yah avishesh dwaitvaad hi he
 Madhvacharya accepted Ramanujacharya's classification of souls
 jaise :-- Madhvacharya added two more classes with him which is worthy of salvation and which is not worthy of salvation: is vargeekaran ke anusaar jeevatma kaa ek alag astitv he
 Thus one soul is different from another soul
 iskaa arthatma anek hai
 The Jeevatma is dependent on the divine instructions from God and being different from nature
 unke pichley janmon ke aadhaar par paramatma unhen prerit karte hai
 According to the previous deeds, the living beings suffer, due to which their soul becomes pure and freed from life and death and experiences the joy which is the spontaneity of the soul
 anandanubhuti main jeevatma bhinn hoti he
 But there is no disharmony in them and they become holy and attain Parabrahma
 lekin ve paramatma ke baraabar nahin ho saktin
 They become worthy of serving God
 navdha bhakthi maarg se aatma paramatma kii krupa se mukti praapt kar leti he

 The Lahore Preamble was an official political concept proposed by the All India Muslim League in 1940, which was passed during the three-day Lahore session of the Muslim League from 22 to 24 March 1940

 Subsequently, this concept was changed to demand a separate independent autonomous country called Pakistan for the "muslims of India"

 The first general elections were held in 1936 / 1937 in the first phase of the process of handing over power to the public by the British Raj in the subcontinent, the Muslim League had to be defeated badly and its claim that it was severely demoralized by the Muslims of the subcontinent
 The only representative is the House

 The Congress had a clear majority in Madras, U

 The Muslim League could not gain power in any of the 11 provinces of India
 in paristhitiyon main muslim lig aisa lagata tha, upmahadweep ke raajnneetik dhara se alag hoti ja rahi he
 During this period, the Congress, which for the first time had drunk too much of power, took such measures that fear and threats started taking birth in the hearts of the Muslims
 jaise congress ne hindi ko rashtrabhasha ghoshit kar diya, gaao kshay par pabandi laga di or congress ke tirange ko rashtriya dhvaj kaa darja diya
 With the Muslim League losing power in this case, there was a feeling under its leadership that the Muslim League was deprived of power on the grounds that it called itself the House of Representatives of Muslims
 yahi prarambh bindu tha muslim lig ke netritv main do alag rashtron kii bhaavana jaagrukta ki
 At the same time, the discussion between the British Raj and the Congress on the issue of full transfer of power in return for World War II support broke out and when the Congress split from power, some doors were opened for the Muslim League

 4 days before the meeting, the Din Party of Allama Eastern in Lahore broke a ban and held a military parade, which the police opened fire to prevent

 Due to this incident, there was tremendous tension in Lahore and in Punjab, the Muslim League's ally, the Uniunsat Party was in power and there was a danger that the shin carrier workers of Deen should not allow this meeting of the Muslim League or there is an uproar on this occasion 
 sanyog hi gambhirtha ke maddenjar mohammad ali jinna ne udghaatan satr ko sambodhit kiya jisamen unhone pehali baar kaha ki bharat main samasya sampradayik raarna tarah kaa nahin he balki ben international he yani yah do deshon kii samasya he
 He said that the difference between Hindus and Muslims is so big and clear that their alliance under a central government will be full of dangers
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main ek hi rasta he ki unhen alag mamalakatein hoon
 On the same day, on 23 March, the then Chief Minister of Bengal, Maulvi Kripa Haq, gave a resolution in Lahore, stating that no constitutional scheme would be feasible nor would Muslims have until the geographical units met each other
 Separate singing areas should not be limited
 sankalp main kaha gaya tha ki in kshetron main jahaan musalamaanon kii sankhyatmak bahumat he jaise ki bharat ke uttar pashchimi or purvottar kshetra, unhen sangyojan unhen mukt mamalakatein sthapit kii jaaen jinamein shaamil ikaayiyon ko swaittata or samprabhutaa ucch mil
 The resolution offered by Maulvi Inam-ul was supported by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyalsam, Punjab, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, Sardar Aurangzeb Sindh from the border, Abdullah Haroon from Sindh and Qazi Isa from Balochistan
 sankalp 23 march ko samaapan satr main paarit kiya gaya
 In April 1941, at the conference of the Muslim League in Madras, the resolution Lahore was included in the party's constitution and it was on this basis that the Pakistan movement started
 lekin phir bhi in kshetron kii spasht pahchaan nahin kii gai thi, jinamein shaamil alag muslim rajyon kii maang kiya ja rahaa tha
 For the first time, areas for Pakistan's demand were identified on 7 April 1946 in a three-day conference in Delhi attended by Muslim Legion members of the Central and Provincial Legislative Assemblies
 is sammelan main britain se aane vaale cabinet mishan ke pratinidhimandal ke saamne muslim lig kii maang pesh karne ke liye ek prastaav paarit kiya gaya tha jiskaa masauda muslim lig kii kaaryakarini ke do sadasyon choudhary riek lsamaan or hasan isohani ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The areas to be included in Pakistan were clearly identified in this Karadad
 purvottar main bengal or assam or uttar pashchim main punjab, seemaa, sindh or baluchistan
 Surprisingly, there was no mention of Kashmir in this resolution although there was a Muslim dominated area in the North West and annexed to Punjab
 yah baat behad mahatvapurn he ki dilli kanvension is sankalp main do rajyon kaa ullekh bilkul hataa diya gaya tha jo sankalp lahore main bahut spasht rup se tha uski jagah pakistan kii ekmaatr rajya kii maang kii gai thi
 Perhaps few people know that the original draft of Sankalp Lahore was prepared by Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the then UNIANSUT Chief Minister of Punjab
 uninst party us jamaane main muslim lig main ekikrut ho gai thi or sir sikandar hayaat khan punjab muslim lig ke adhyaksh the
 In the original draft resolution, the head Sikandar Hayat Khan proposed almost a central government on the basis of a central government in the subcontinent, but when the draft was considered in the Muslim League Subject Committee, quaid-e-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah himself mentioned the only central government in this draft
 chopped off
 sir sikandar hayaat khan is baat par sakht naaraaz the or unhone 11 march san 1941 ko punjab vidhansabha main saaf-saaf kaha tha ki unka pakistan kaa najariya jinna sahab ke siddhant mukhya rup se alag he
 He said that he was strongly opposed to the distribution on the basis of Hindu Raj on the one hand and Muslim Raj on the other hand in India and he would fight against their destructive distribution in such a manner
 magar aisa nahin hua
 Sir Sikander Hayat Khan died the second year in 1942, at the age of 50, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah got freedom from Hisar in Punjab due to intense opposition

 lekin jab pakistan kii samvidhan sabha samvidhan set karegi to vah is samasya ke antim madhyasth hogi or yah do alag rajyon ke gathan ke faisle kaa puraa adhikaar hoga
 But the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan did not consider the establishment of two independent and autonomous states of Muslims in the subcontinent neither in quaid-e-azam life nor when the country's first constitution was passed in 1956

 Electricity is associated with many well-known phenomena such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction, and electric current

 Electricity has many effects such as magnetic fields, heat, chemical effects, etc
 jab vidyut or chumbakatv kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya jaataa he to ise vidyut chumbakatv kehete hai
 Electricity can be defined in many ways, but in simple words, the normal state generated as a result of the presence and flow of electric charge is called electricity which has the ability to carry out many tasks
 vidyut chal athwa achal electron yaa proton se sambaddh ek bhautik ghatana he
 The energy generated by the flow of electric charges in a conductor is called electricity

 The modern word 'electron' is used in Greek for ambar
 'electricity' shabd kaa upyog san 1650 main walter sharlton ne kiya
 At the same time Robert Biel discovered that charged objects also attract light objects to zero, that is, it is not necessary to be an air medium for the effect of electricity
 san 1729 main steefan grey ne apane prayogon ke aadhaar par kaha ki yah aakarshan shakti kisi vastu ke ek bhaag se duusare bhaag ko sanchaarit kii ja sakati he
 Desaguliers called such objects as 'drivers'
 sabhi prakaar kii dhaatuen is shrenee main aati hai
 The objects in which this power cannot be transmitted are called insulators
 is shrenee main ambar, mom, sukhi hawa, sookhaa kaanch, rabar, lakh ityadi hai
 Due to rubbing of objects, there are two types of electricity, positive and negative

 At about this time efforts were also being made to get adequate amount of electricity and various types of electrical devices were invented
 wilia vatsan kaa vichaar tha ki vidyut ek prakaar kaa pratyasth taral hoti he jo prayek vastu main vidyaman hoti he
 It is in ordinary quantity in chargeless objects, hence it cannot be inspected
 watasan ke taral siddhant ke anusaar vidyut ek vastu se duusari vastu main chali jaati he
 American scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin extended this theory by supporting it
 franklin ne kaha ki vidyut na to utpann kii ja sakati he, na nasht hi
 Franklin tried to study the Leiden jar to explain its action
 par franklin kaa sabase prasiddh evam mahatvapurn vah prayog tha, sisamen unhone siddh kiya ki meghon se meghgarjan ke samay vidyut tathaa saadhaaran vidyut ke gun samaan hai
 He also said that electric particles exert force on each other
 franklin ke pashchaat apinus ne in vichaaron ko liya tathaa iskaa abhas diya ki do vastuon kaa bal unke bich kii duuri badhaane par ghat jaataa he
 This theory was expanded by Jajeff Priestley and Henry Cavendish
 phir kulom ne khoj kii ki do aaveshon ke bich kaa bal, unke bich kii duuri ke varg ke vyutakramanupati tathaa aaveshon ke gunanfal ke samaanupati hota he
 This basic law of electricity is still called 'balonium of Coulom'
 san 1837 main maaikel farade ne kinhin do aaweshit vastuon ke bich ke vidyut bal par madhyam ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa pataa lagaaya ki yadi madhyam hawa ke sthaan par koi or vidyutarodhi ho to vidyut bal ghat jaataa he, vidyut rodhi ke is gun ko unhone 'vishisht parvaidyutta' athwa paraavidhyut kaha
 He demonstrated, by his famous use of icebergs, that if a charged conductor is brought into a vessel, an internal charge is induced on the inside of the vessel and a homogeneous charge on the outside
 farade ne paraavidhyut kaa gahan adhyayan kiya tathaa unke vibhinn prabhaavon ko samajhane ke liye vidyut bal rekhaon kaa vichaar upasthit kiya tathaa aaweshit vastuon ke bich ke khaali sthaan ko 'kshetra' kaha
 Gauss advanced Faraday's field theory with the help of mathematics

 In 1780, Italy's Lugi Galvani made several experiments of electric current over the paddock
 san 1800 main volta ne tanu amla athwa lavan vilyan se bhigi hui do asmaan dhaatuon main vidyut prabhaav paae tathaa unase vidyut dhara praapt kii
 To multiply this electric current, he made a bridge called joints of many dissimilar metals called voltaic masses
 volta dwaara in prayogon ke anusaar vidyuddhara praapt karne ke liye 'voltiy cell' kii rachana hui
 In the same year in England, Nicholson and Carlyle discovered that if an electric current were to flow in water, the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen
 aise apghaton ko vaidyut apghaton kehete hai

 Decades after Davis developed his theory, many studies of geomorphology attempted to fit his ideas into this mold for landscape development on a large scale, and are often referred to today as "davisian"
 davis ke vichaaron ko kaaphi had tak aaj paar kar liya gaya he, mukhya rup se unamem purvanumaan kshamta or gunatmak prakruti kii kami kii vajah se, lekin ve is vishay ke itihaas main ek atyant mahatvapurn vyakti bane hue hai
 In the 1920s, Walter Pank developed an alternative model to Davis's model, assuming that topographic evolution could be better defined as a balance between continuous processes of uplift and denudation, not Davis's single uplift
 As decay occurring after

 Particular important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include: aadhunik bhu-akruti vigyaan, paraspar sambandhit prakriyaaon ke maatraatmak vishleshan par kendrit he
 Modern advances in geochemistry, especially cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry and fission track dating, have enabled us to first measure the rates at which geomorphic processes occur on a geologically relevant timeline

 The nature of the processes investigated by a geologist is strongly dependent on the landscape or topography involved in the investigation, and the interest of the time and length line
 haalanki, nimnlikhit gaiyr-vistrut suchi inamen se kuch ke saath jude bhudrishy tatwon kii ek jhalak pradaan karti he
 The primary surface processes responsible for most topographic forms include wind, wave, chemical dissolution, mass destruction, groundwater activity, surface water flow, ice action, tectonics, and volcanoes
 anya adhik gambhir bhu-akritik prakriyaaon main shaamil ho saktaa he perigleshial prakriyaayein, namak kii madhyasthata vaali kriya, yaa parloukik prabhaav
 Rivers and streams are not only carriers of water but also sediment
 pani, jab sataha par pravaahman rahata he, to vah talachhaton kaa istemaal karne main sakasham hota he or inhen neeche kii taraf baha le jaataa he, yaa to tal bhaar athwa prasupt bhaar ke rup main yaa phir vighatit bhaar ke rup main
 The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and the discharge of the river
 nadiyaan nae chattaanon kaa apradan karne or nae talachat banane main bhi sakasham hai, apane tal dwaara or aasapaas pahari dhalaanon ke saath yugman dwaara
 is tarah, nadiyon ko gaiyr-himandeey vaataavaran main bade paimaane ke bhudrishy ke liye aadhaar str kii sthapana karne ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Rivers are important sources of exposure to various landscape elements
 jab nadiyaan sthalakritiyon se hote hue pravaahit hoti hai, ve aam taur par aakaar main badi ho jaati hai or anya nadiyon ke saath mil jaati hai
 The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system and is often dendritic, but may also assume other forms depending on the underlying geology and local topography

 Although water and large flows use more material than air in most environments, aeration processes are important in dry environments, deserts
 mitti, regolyth or pathar, gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke antargat rengte hue, ludhakte hue, behate hue, girte hue nichi kii taraf jate hai
 Such massive breakdowns occur on terrestrial and slopes and have been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Eeapetus
 pahaad ke dhalaanon par chal rahi prakriyaayein dhalaan ke sataha kii sansthiti ko badal sakati hai, jo badale main un prakriyaaon kii daron ko parivartit kar sakati he
 Slopes that deepen to a delicate state are able to quickly release large amounts of material, making the sloping process an important element of landscape in tectonically active areas
 prithvi par, jaivik prakriyaayein jaise ki khudaai yaa tree thro kuch dhalaani prakriyaaon kii daron ko nirdhaarit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Glaciers, which are geographically limited, are effective factors for landscape change
 ghati main neeche kii taraf dhire-dhire jate barf kii gatividhi neeche kii chattan kaa gharshan karti he or use ukhaad detii he
 Friction produces fine sediment, called glacial flour
 himand ke samaapt ho jane ke baad uske dwaara parivahan kiye gaye malbe ko moren kaha jaataa he
 Glacial erosion is attributed to U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys formed by the river
 himand kii prakriya jis tarah se anya bhudrishy tatwon ke saath sampark karti he, vishesh rup se dhalaani or nadi kii prakriyaaon ke saath, vah plio-plistosin bhudrishy vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he or uske talachat kai oonchi pahari ke vaataavaran main milte hai
 Environments that have been snow-capped relatively recently but are no longer can still show higher landscape change rates than landscapes that have never been snow-capped
 gaiyr-himand bhu-akritik prakriyaayein jinhen tis par bhi purv himachhadan dwaara anukulit kiya gaya he unhen parahimanad prakriyaayein kaha jaataa he
 This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by the formation or melting of ice or frost

 radha krishna ek hindu devtaa hai
 Krishna is often referred to as God herself in Gaudiya Vaishnava theology and Radha is a young woman, a gopi who is Krishna's supreme lover
 krishna ke saath, radha ko sarvocch devi sweekaar kiya jaataa he or yah kaha jaataa he ki vah apane prem se krishna ko niyantrit karti hai
 It is believed that Krishna fascinates the world, but Radha "fascinates him as well
 isliye ve sabhi kii sarvocch devi hai
 Radha Krishna "
 haalanki bhagwaan ke aise rup kii puja karne ke kaaphi aarambhik sandarbh maujuud hai, par jab san barahavin shatabdi main jayadev goswami ne prasiddh geet govind likhaa, to divya krishna or unki bhakt radha ke bich ke aadhyatmik prem sambandh ke vishay ko sampoorn bharatvarsh main puja jane laga
 It is believed that Krishna has left the cycle of Raas dance to find Radha
 chaitanya sampradaay kaa maananaa he ki radha ke naam or pahchaan ko bhagwat puraana main is ghatana kaa varnan karne vaale chand main gupt bhi rakhaa gaya he or ujagar bhi kiya gaya he
 It is also believed that Radha is not just a shepherd's daughter, but is the origin of all the gopis or those divine personalities who participate in the Raas dance

 vrindavan main krishna ko kabhi-kabhi baayen taraf khadi radha ke saath chitrit kiya jaataa he, jinaki chaati par lakshmi virajman hai
 The common etymology of Shakti and Shaktimaan, that is, God and Male doctrine in God, means that Shakti and Shaktimaan are one
 har devtaa kaa apana saathi, 'ardhangini' yaa shakti hoti he or us shakti ke bina unhen kabhi-kabhi aprihaary shakti ke bina mana jaataa he
 It is not uncommon in Hinduism that when the worship of God is done by worshiping a pair rather than a single personality, such is the worship of Radha Krishna
 vah parampara jisamen krishna kii puja swayan bhagwaan ke rup main kii jaati he, jo purush hai, us parampara main shaamil he unki radha kaa sandarbh or gungan, jinhen sarvocch ke rup main puja jaataa he
 The idea is accepted that the confluence of Radha and Krishna may indicate the confluence of Shaktimaan with Shakti, and the idea exists well outside orthodox Vaishnavism or Krishnaism
 vaishnav drushtikon se divine stri urja, urja ke ek divya strot ko pratibimbit karti he, ishwar yaa shaktimaan 
 "sita ram se sambandhit hai, lakshmi narayan kii sahachari hai; radha ke krishna hai
 "since Krishna is considered the source of all forms of God, Sri Radha, his companion, is the original source of all powers or the feminine form of divine energy
 parampara ke anusaar, aradhana ko samajhane ke liye vibhinn vyakhyaaon main ek nizwaadee samaan mul he

8
100, after which he describes the role of Radha in the ancient times of Vrindavan

 The religious usage of the word can be traced back to the earliest times, two thousand years before the Nimbarka or Chaitanya Sampradaya, in a phrase that is often quoted in the tradition: "verily, God is Rasa" from the Brahma Sutra
 This line expresses the idea that God is the one who enjoys supreme rasa or spiritual zeal, emotion
 hindu dharm kii nimnlikhit paramparaon main radha krishna kii puja kii jaati he: King Garib Nivaz ruled from 1709 to 1748 and took initiation into the Vaishnava branch of the Chaitanya tradition, which worships Krishna as the supreme God, God Himself

 In Vedic and mythological literature, Radha and other forms of this metal> Radha also means 'perfection', 'success' and 'wealth'
 Indra, the god of success, was referred to as Radhaspati
 bhagya ke devtaa ke rup main mahavishnu ke sandarbh main or jayadev dwaara jai jayadev hare ke rup main swatantra rup se prayukt - vijayi hari or radhaspati, sabhi ko kai jagahon par dekha gaya he

 Nappinai is considered to be the source of the concept of Radha in Prakrit and Sanskrit literature, although his character relationship with Krishna differs
 ek anushthan nrity main jise kurawai kehete hai, krishna apni patni nappinai ke saath nrity karte hai
 "it is a complex relationship, because the devotee is 'same yet different' from God and therefore there is a pain of rebellion in the joy of union

 Gaudiya Vaishnavas, as the name suggests, usually denote the region of Bengal
 aarambhik bangla sahitya main is chithran kaa or radha or krishna kii samaj ke vikaas kaa kaa vishad varnan miltaa he
 However, it is believed that the source of her heroine in Jayadeva Goswami's poem Geet Govinda remains a puzzle in Sanskrit literature
 saath hi gita govind se pehle kii kritiyon ke bare main bhi likhit sandarbh bhalee prakaar maujuud hai jo kareeb ginati main bees hai
 Radha's personality is one of the most esoteric characters in Sanskrit literature; He is described only in a few selected verses in Prakrit or Sanskrit poetry, in some inscriptions and some works of grammar, poetry and drama
 Jaidev referred to him and composed an excellent poem full of passionate devotion in the twelfth century and a huge movement started in this poem, especially in Bengal
 baru chandidas ek kavi hai jo aarmabhik madhya bengal ke ek aitihaasik vyaktitv ke rup main ullekhneey hai; unki kavita shrikrishnakirthan kaa kaal abhi bhi anuttarit he, haalanki yah kriti bangla sahitya or dharm main "gopika radha ke liye bhagwaan krishna ke prem" kii lokapriy katha ke chithran kaa ek sabase mahatvapurn praarambhik sakshya he

 The Nimbarka sect worships Bal Krishna, whether alone or with his companion Radha, as the Rudra sect does and its earliest period is at least twelfth century
 According to Nimbark, Radha was a perpetual companion of Vishnu and Krishna, and so is the opinion, though not an explicit statement, that she became the wife of her lover Krishna
 yah dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki nimbark is sahitya ke prakalpit aniatik nihitarth se radha ko bachaate hai or unhen vah garima pradaan karte hai jo unhen kahin or nahin mili
 The Nimbarka Sampradaya, founded by Nimbarka, is one of the four real Vaishnava traditions
 13veen sadi or 14veen sadi main mathura or vrundavan ke vinaash ke kaaran sakshya ke abhaav kaa matlab he ki sahi tithi or is parampara kaa mul rahasy main duba he or jaanch kii zarurat he
 Satyanand Joseph, Prof
 Rasik Bihari Joshi, Prof
 MM Nimbarka is considered by scholars like Agrawal etc
 to be the same period in which Shankaracharya was born and he was the first Acharya to worship Radha with Krishna in the Sakhi Bhava worship system
 apane vedant kamdhenu dashashloki main, yah spasht kaha gaya he: - Anghe tu vamara vurasanujam muda virajamanam anusarasubhagam

 Verses 6
 The left part of the body of God the Father is Shrimati Radha, who is sitting with joy and is as beautiful as God herself; In whose service there are thousands of gopis: We meditate on that supreme goddess, who is the fulfillment of all desires
 is vishay ko jayadev goswami or us samay ke anya kaviyon dwaara apanaaya gaya jinhone us anternihit sundarata or anand ko dekha jisase is darshan kaa nirmaan hua tha
 The importance of Radha in this community is not less than the importance of Shri Krishna
 nimbark ke is sampradaay main donon hi sanyukt rup se aradhana kii vastu hai
 Nimbarka, under the name vedanta-parijat-saurabh, is also one of the first commentators of the Brahma Sutra
 13veen or 14veen sadi main nimbark sampradaay ke baad ke aacharyon ne is divine jodi par adhik saahitiyik rachanaaen kii
 Jayadev's elder brother, Swami Shri Shree Bhatt, composed a double century for the Dhrupada style of musical performance similar to Jayadeva, but unlike Jayadev, who wrote his composition in Sanskrit, Swami Shreebhatt's compositions are in Vraj language, Which is a local form of Hindi which was understood by all the inhabitants of Vraj
 vastav main is parampara ke aacharyon ne vraj bhashaa main likhaa or aadhunik samay main is bhashaa ke alp prasar ke kaaran, bahut kam shodh kiya gaya he, haalanki ye acharya, vrindavan ke chah goswamiyon se kai sadi pehle hue the
 In any case, the only object of worship in the Nimbarka sect is the combined divine couple Radha Krishna
 15veen sadi ke jagadguru swami shri harivyas devacharya dwaara likhit mahavani ke anusaar Radhamakrishnwaroopam vai, Krishnam radhaswarupinam; Kalatmanam Nikunjastham Gururupam Sada bhaje i constantly praise Radha who is none other than Krishna and Sri Krishna, Radha, whose yoga is represented by Kamabijas and who always resides in Goloka Vrindavan
 radha krishna ke darshan main nimbark sampradaay ke yogadan ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa he, kyonki yah darshan or dharamshastra isi se aarambh hua tha
 Radha Krishna Dev's place in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya is special because Swaminarayan himself referred to Radha Krishna himself in Shikshapatri which he wrote
 iske alaava, unhone khud mandiron ke nirmaan kaa aadesh diya jisamen radha krishna ko devataaon ke rup main sthapit kiya gaya he
 Swaminarayan stated "krishna manifests in many forms
 jab ve radha ke saath hote hai, to unhen radha-krishna naam ke antargat sarvocch ishwar mana jaataa he; rukmani ke saath lakshmi-narayan janaa jaataa he
 "the first temple in this community was constructed in Ahmedabad in 1822 AD, in the central chamber of which the forms of Narayana, Arjuna and Krishna are installed
 haul ke baayen taraf ke mandir main radha krishna kii murtiyon he
 According to the philosophy of this tradition, Krishna had many female companions, the gopis, but among them Radha was considered the best devotee
 jo krishna ke kareeb aane kii chaah rakhte hai unhen radha jaisi bhakthi ke gun viksit karnaa chahie
 According to this theory, the sect has set aside Goloka as a supreme heaven or abode, as Krishna is believed to have enjoyed it with his gopis, who according to the Swaminarayan sect are the Gwalinas with whom Krishna danced; Krishna's relationship with him symbolizes the redemptive relationship of God and devotee
 chaitanya se bhi pehle pushtimaarg ke sansthaapak, vallabhacharya radha kii puja karte the, jahaan kuch sampradaayon ke anusaar, bhakton kii pahchaan radha kii saheliyon ke rup main hoti he jinhen radhakrishna ke liye antarang vyavastha karne ke liye visheshadhikaar praapt hota he
 a prominent poet of this tradition, Dhruvadas, also known as Radha Vallabhi, was noted for being primarily associated with the personal relationship of Radha and Krishna
 apni kavita churaasi pad main or apane anuyaayiyon kii tippaniyon main, jor diya jaataa he anant lila ke nirantar manan ke adwitiya laabh par
 Radhavallabhi, along with her Vaishnava co-religionists, has immense reverence for the Bhagavata Purana, but some intimacy that is outside the purview of relationships with Radha and the Gopis is not included in the philosophy of this sect
 rishte kii mithaas par bal diya gaya he, yaa ras par
 There was a golden age in the opinion of some Hindu scholars and pioneers of Hinduism when Hindus and Muslims created a common culture mainly due to the preservation of translation from Sanskrit and Sanskrit to Persian by some Muslim rulers, while the Muslim name there Wale was a poet who wrote about Krishna and Radha
 vrindavan or mathura ko radha-krishna kii puja kaa centre mana jaataa he
 The most important temples of Vrindavan are shri radha raas bihari asht sakhi mandir vrundavan main, bhagwaan krishna kaa "lila sthaan", par yah mandir he jahaan krishna ke un bhakton ke liye janaa aavashyak he jo 84 kosh vraj parikrama yatra ko puraa karte hai
 This temple is centuries old and is the first Indian temple dedicated to this divine couple and their Ashta Sakhis - eight "friends" of Radha who were intimately involved in her love leela with Krishna
 in asht sakhiyon kii charchaa veda puraanon or shrimad bhagwat ke pracheen granthon main varnit hai
 This temple is called - Sri Radha Ras Bihari Ashta Sakhi Temple and is the place of the divine Ras Leela of Lord Krishna and Radharani
 yah shri banke bihari mandir ke nikat sthit he
 Legend has it that Sri Radha Ras Bihari Ashta Sakhi Temple is one of the two places in Mathura, Vrindavan where Lord Krishna joins Ras Leela with his beloved Radha and his friends

 The reason for this difference is not entirely clear
 yah yaa to behatar vaayu pravaah, ke kaaran ho saktaa he yaa upree fefdon ke bheetar kharaab lymph pravaah ke kaaran ho saktaa he
 In 15–20% of active cases, the infection spreads outside the respiratory organs, causing other types of TB

 The likelihood of spread from one person to another depends on a number of factors including the exit of infectious droplets by the carrier, the effectiveness of air circulation, the duration of the infectious stay, the severity of the M
 tuberculosis effect, the level of resistance in the uninfected person and others
 Is included

 His description is very similar to the Vedic deity Varuna
 agni ko ishvarputra samaan or atyant pavitra mana jaataa he
 It is through this that Ahura Mazda is worshiped
 parsi mandiron ko aatish beharam kaha jaataa he
 Spenta Amesha is their seven angels
 verigod According to Parsi belief, Ahura Mazda's enemy is the evil Angira Manu
 ek jamaane main parsi dharm iran kaa rajdharm hua karata tha
 He took refuge in India
 tabase aaj tak parsiyon ne bharat ke udai main bahut bada yogadan diya he
 When ancient Persia was a vast empire stretching from Eastern Europe to Central Asia, the Prophet Zarathustra laid the foundation of Zoroastrianism, conveying a theism
 zarathustra va unke anuyaayiyon ke bare main vistrut itihaas gyaat nahin he
 The reason is that first Alexander's forces and later Arab invaders destroyed almost all the religious and cultural literature of ancient Persia
 aaj ham is itihaas ke bare main jo kuch bhi jaanate hai, vah iran ke pahaado main utkeern shila lekhon tathaa vaachik parampara kii badaulat he
 By the seventh century AD, the Persian Empire had lost its archaic splendor and power
 jab arabon ne is par nirnaayak vijay praapt kar lee to apane dharm kii raksha hetu anek jarathosti dharmavalambee samudr ke raste bhaag nikle or unhone bharat ke pashchimi tat par sharan lee
 Here they were called 'parsis'
 aaj vishvabhar main maatr sava se dedh lakh ke bich jarathosti hai
 More than half of these are in India
 faras ke shahenshaah vishtasp ke shasankaal main pangbar zarathustra ne dur-dur tak bhraman kar apana sandesh diya
 According to him God is only one
 is ishwar ko zarathustra ne 'ahura majadaa' kaha arthath 'mahaan jivan daata'
 Ahura Mazda is not a person, but is a sattva, a force, an energy
 zarathustra ke darshananusaar vishwa main do aadya atmaaon ke bich nirantar sangharsh jari he
 One of them is the soul of Ahura Mazda, 'spenta Menu'
 duusari he dusht aatma 'angharaa manu'
 To destroy this evil spirit, Ahura Mazda created this material world with his seven works namely sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals, humans and fire
 ve jaanate the ki apni vidhwanskaari prakruti tathaa agyaan ke chalate angharaa manu is vishwa par hamalaa karegaa or isamen avyavashtha, asaty, dukh, krurta, rugnataa evam mrityu kaa pravesh kara degaa
 Man, the masterpiece of Ahura Mazda, has a central role in this struggle
 use swechha se is sangharsh main buree aatma se loha lenaa he
 In this war, his weapons will be goodness, truth, strength, devotion, ideal and immortality
 in siddhanton par amal kar maanav antat vishwa kii tamaam buraai ko samaapt kar degaa
 Some more scientific interpreters interpret religion's 'spenta menu' differently
 iske anusaar 'spenta manu' koi aatma nahin, balki sanvriddhishil, pragatisheel man athwa maansikta he
 That is, it is a quality of Ahura Mazda, the quality that creates and enhances the universe
 ishwar ne spenta manu kaa srijan isiilie kiya tha ki ek aanandadaayak vishwa kaa nirmaan kiya ja sake
 The progressive mindset divides human beings into two classes on earth
 sadaachari, jo vishwa kaa sanvardhan karte hai tathaa duraachaari, jo isaki pragati ko rokte hai
 Zarathustra wants that every person should be like God, adopt life-giving energy and be the carrier of creation, enrichment and progress
 paigambar zarathustra ke upadeshon ke anusaar vishwa ek naitik vyavastha he
 This system has not only to maintain itself, but also to develop and enhance itself
 jarathosti dharm main jadta kii anumati nahin he
 Evil forces hamper the process of development, but man is not to be distracted by it
 use sadachaar ke path kar kaayam rahete hue sadaa vikaas kii disha main badhate rahanaa he
 Each moment of life has a definite purpose
 yah koi anayas shuru hokar anayas hi samaapt ho jane vaali cheez nahin he
 Everything is according to God's plan
 sarvocch achchhai hi hamaare jivan kaa uddeshy hona chahie
 Man has to live with goodness, through goodness, for goodness
 'humat', 'huukt' tathaa 'huvarshat' jarathosti jivan paddati ke aadhaar stambh hai
 Zoroastrianism prohibits monasticism, celibacy, fasting, self-suppression etc
 aisa mana gaya he ki inase manushya kamjor hota he or buraai se ladane kii uski takat kam ho jaati he
 Pessimism and depression have been given the status of sin
 zarathustra chaahate hai ki maanav is vishwa kaa puraa anand uthaae, khush rahe
 Whatever he does, just be sure of one thing and that never deviate from the path of virtue
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon se sampann jivan kii manaahi nahin he, lekin yah bhi kaha gaya he ki samaaj se tum jitna lete ho, usase adhik use do
 To get something by killing or exploiting someone is a misdemeanor
 jo hamase kam sampann hai, unki sadaiv madad karnaa chahie
 In Zarathosti religion, death is considered a temporary victory of evil
 iske baad mritak kii aatma kaa insaaf hoga
 If she is virtuous, then she will be inhabited by joy and light, and if misdemeanor, she will go into the depths of darkness and despair, but this state of vicious soul is also temporary
 aakhir jarathosti dharm vishwa kaa antim uddeshy achchhai kii jeet ko maanata he, buraai kii sajaa ko nahin
 Hence it is believed that eventually many liberators will come and complete the victory of good over evil
 tab ahura majadaa aseem prakaash ke rup main sarvasamarthyavan honge
 Then the spirits will have the final say
 iske baad bhautik sharir kaa punarotthana hoga tathaa uskaa apni aatma ke saath punarmilan hoga
 Time will cease to exist and the seven works of Ahura Mazda will come together in eternal blessedness and attain blissful, eternal existence

 hindi aalochana kii shuruyaat 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main bharatendu yug se hi maani jaati he
 'criticism' literally means 'to look well'
 'aalochana' shabd 'luch' dhaatu se bana he
 'luch' means 'to see'
 samiksha or samalochna shabdon kaa bhi yahi arth he
 'criticism' is treated as a synonym for the term 'criticism' in English
 sanskrit main prachlit 'tikaa-vyakhya' or 'kavy-siddhantanirupan' ke liye bhi aalochana shabd kaa prayog kar liya jaataa he kintu acharya ramachandra shukla kaa spasht mat he ki aadhunik aalochana, sanskrit ke kavy-siddhantanirupan se swatantra chiz he
 The task of criticism is to examine a literary work thoroughly and determine its form, population and economy
 doctor shyamsundar das ne aalochana kii paribhaasha in shabdon main di he: That is, the duty of criticism is a literary interpretation of a literary work
 sahityakar jivan or anbhuv ke jin tatwon ke sanshleshan se sahitya rachana karata he, aalochana unheen tatwon kaa vishleshan karti he

 aalochana aitihaasik, saamaajik, raajnneetik paristhitiyon or shistayon kaa bhi akalan karti he or sahitya par unke padane vaale prabhaavon kii vivechna karti he
 Condemning or criticizing a work based on personal interest is not a religion of criticism
 kriti kii vyakhya or vishleshan ke liye aalochana main paddati or pranali kaa mahatva hota he
 While criticizing, the critic can avoid his personal rage, disinterest, disinterest, only when he follows the method, he can only do justice to literature by being objective

 The types of criticism develop according to the beliefs and practices that are accepted when criticizing
 saamanyat: samiksha ke chaar prakaaron ko sweekaar kiya gaya he:- Theories of literature are considered in theoretical criticism
 isamen pracheen shastreey kaavyagon - ras, alankaar aadi or sahitya kii aadhunik manyataon tathaa niyamon kii mukhya rup se vivchena kii jaati he
 In theoretical criticism the point of consideration is whether the criterion of literature is classical or historical
 maandand kaa shastreey rup, sthir or aparivartansheel hota he kintu mandandon ko aitihaasik shrenee maananaper unka swaroop parivartansheel or vikasaatmak hota he
 Both types of theoretical criticisms are available
 kintu ab usee saiddhanthik aalochana kaa mahatva adhik he jo sahitya ke tatwon or niyamon kii aitihaasik prakriya main vikasman maanati he
 When literature is decided on the basis of certain principles, it is called judgmental criticism
 ise ek prakaar kii naitik aalochana bhi mana jaataa he
 Its main nature is to pass judgment on literary works like a judge
 aisi aalochana praaia: hi siddhanth kaa yantric dhang se upyog karti he
 Therefore, the importance of decisive criticism decreases
 yadhyapi mulya yaa shreshth sahitya or nikrusht sahitya kaa bodh paidaa karnaa aalochana ke pradhan dharmon main se ek he lekin vah siddhanton ke yantric upyog se nahin sabhanv he
 In the 'hindi Sahitya Kosh', the subject of decisive criticism is told: is prakaar aalochana main nirnay vivaad kaa bindu utana nahin he jitna nirnay ke liye apanaaya gaya tarika
 Like, there is value judgment in Ramchandra Shukla's criticism, but his method is creative, not mechanical
 nirnayaatmak aalochana main mulya or tarika, donon kii main lacheelaapan nahin hota
 In this critique, the effect of poetry on critic Cayman makes him busy with the stylish designation
 isamen vayactik ruchi hi mukhya he
 Effective Criticism is not an object of shock
