 vishwamitra shabd vishwa or mitra se bana he jiskaa arth he- sabake saath maitri athwa prem
 One day King Vishwamitra went to the ashram of Vashistha Rishi with his army
 vishwamitra ji unhen pranaam karke vahiin baith gayi
 Vashishtha paid proper respect to Vishwamitra ji and requested him to stay in the ashram for a few days and receive hospitality
 is par yah vichaar karke ki mere saath vishaal sena he or sena sahit meraa aatithy karne main vashishtha ji ko ksht hoga, vishwamitra ji ne namratapurvak apane jane kii anumati maangi kintu vashishtha ji ke atyadhik anurodh karne par thode dinon ke liye unka aatithy sweekaar kar liya
 Vashistha called upon Nandini Gau and arranged for Vishwamitra and his army six types of dishes and all kinds of amenities
 vashishtha ji ke aatithy se vishwamitra or unke saath aaye sabhi log bahut prasann huye
 Seeing the miracle of Nandini Gau, Vishwamitra asked that cow from Vashistha ji but Vashistha said Rajan! This cow is my life and i cannot give it to anyone at any cost
 vashishtha ji ke is prakaar kehane par vishwamitra ne balaat us gau ko pakad lene kaa aadesh de diya or uske sainik us gau ko dande se maar maar kar haankane lage
 Nandini Gau got angry and freed her bond from those soldiers and came to Vashistha and started mourning
 vashishtha ji bole ki he nandini! yah raja meraa atithi he isaliye main isko shaap bhi nahin de saktaa or iske paas vishaal sena hone ke kaaran isse yuddh main bhi vijay praapt nahin kar saktaa
 i feel compelled to unke in vachanon ko sun kar nandini ne kaha ki he brahmarshi! aap mujhe ajna dijiye, main ek kshan main is kshatriya raja ko uski vishaal senasahit nasht kar duungi
 Seeing no other solution, Vashistha gave permission to Nandini
 ajna pate hi nandini ne yogabal se atyant parakramee maarak shastrastron se yukt parakramee yoddhaon ko utpann kiya jinhone sheeghra hi shatru sena ko gaajar muuli kii bhanti kaatna armbh kar diya
 Seeing the destruction of his army, Vishwamitra's hundred sons became very angry and ran to kill Vashistha
 vashishtha ji ne unamem se ek putr ko chhod kar shesh sabhi ko bhasma kar diya
 Vishwamitra was deeply saddened by the destruction of his army and sons
 apane bache huye putr ko raaj singhaasana saunp kar ve tapasya karne ke liye himalay kii kandaraon main chale gayi
 Vishwamitra ji pleased Mahadev ji by doing austerity and received from him the boon of knowledge of complete archery with divine powers
 is prakaar sampoorn dhanurvidya kaa gyaan praapt karke vishwamitra badla lene ke liye vashishtha ji ke ashram main pahunche
 After challenging him, Vishwamitra fired fire
 vashishtha ji ne bhi apana dhanush sambhaal liya or bole ki main tere saamne khadaa hoon, tu mujh par waar kar
 Enraged, Vishwamitra left firearms, varunastra, rudrastra, indrastra and pashupatastra together one after the other, which was destroyed by Vashistha with his deadly weapons
 is par vishwamitra ne or bhi adhik krodhit hokar manvaastra, mohanastra, gandharvastra, junbhanastra, daranastra, vajra, brahmpash, kalpash, varunapash, pinaak dhanush, dandastra, pashachastra, kronchastra, dharmachakr, kalchakra, vishnuchakr, vivyastra, manthanastra, kankal, moosal, vidyadhar, kalastra aadi sabhi astron kaa prayog kar daalaa
 Vashistha destroyed them all and left the cosmic weapon on them
 brahmand astr ke bhayankar jyoti or gaganabhedi naad se sara sansar pidaa se tadapane laga
 All sages and sages started praying to him that you have defeated Vishwamitra
 ab aap brahmand astr se utpann hui jwaala ko shant karen
 Moved by this prayer, he called back the cosmic weapon and calmed it with mantras
 is prakaar vichaar karke ve apni patnisahit dakshin disha kii or chal diye
 He did penance and renounced food and started living only on fruits
 unki tapasya se prasann hokar brahma ji ne unhen rajarshi kaa pad pradaan kiya
 Even after receiving this post, thinking that Brahma Ji gave me the post of Rajarshi only, not of maharishi-devarshi etc
, he was sad
 ve vichaar karne lage ki meri tapasya ab bhi apurna he
 i should do severe penance once again
 " Meanwhile, there was a king named Trishanku in the Ikshvaku dynasty
 trishanku sasharir swarg janaa chaahate the atah iske liye unhone vashishtha ji anurodh kiya kintu vashishtha ji ne is kaary ke liye apni asamarthta jataai
 Trishanku also prayed the same to the sons of Vashistha, who was doing severe penance in the southern province
 vashishtha ji ke putron ne kaha ki jis kaam ko hamaare pita nahin kar sake tu use ham se karana chahta he
 It seems that you have come here to insult our father
 unke is prakaar kehane se trishanku ne krodhit hokar vashishtha ji ke putron ko apshabd kahe
 Vashishtha's sons were angry and cursed Hungku to become a chandala
 shaap ke kaaran trishanku chandal ban gayi tathaa unke mantri tathaa darbari unka saath chhodkar chale gayi
 Yet he did not abandon his desire to go to heaven heavenly
 ve vishwamitra ke paas jaakar bole apni ichha ko purna karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Vishwamitra said you have come to my shelter
 main tumhaari ichha avashya purna karunga
 Having said this, Vishwamitra called all four of his sons who had received him in the southern province while doing penance with his wife and asked them to collect the contents of the yajna
 phir unhone apane shishyon ko bulaakar ajna di ki vashishtha ke putron sahit van main rahane vaale sab rishi-muniyon ko yajna main sammilit hone ke liye nimantran de aao
 All the sages and sages accepted his invitation, but the sons of Vashistha rejected the invitation, saying that we cannot accept the part of the yagna in which the yajman chandala and the priest kshatriya
 yah sunakar vishwamitra ji ne cruddh hokar unhen kalpash main bandh kar yamalok jane or saat sau varshon tak chandal yoni main vicharan karne kaa shaap de diya or yajna kii taiyaari main lag gayi
 Due to Vishwamitra's curse, Vasishtha's son went to Yamlok
 vashishtha ji ke putron ke parinaam se bhaybheet sabhi rishi muniyon ne yajna main vishwamitra kaa saath diya
 At the end of the yagna, Vishwamitra called all the gods to take their yagna portion after taking the name, but no god came to participate
 is par cruddh hokar vishwamitra ne ardhya haath main lekar kaha ki he trishanku! main tuje apni tapasya ke bal se swarg bhejtaa hoon
 After saying this, Vishwamitra sprinkled water in the sky while reading the mantra, and the king ascended into the sky with hung body and reached heaven
 trishanku ko swarg main aayaa dekh indra ne krodh se kaha ki re murkh! tuje tere guru ne shaap diya he isaliye tu swarg main rahane yogya nahin he
 As soon as Indra said this, hung heads fell on the earth and prayed to Vishwamitra for his protection
 vishwamitra ne unhen vahiin thaharne kaa aadesh diya or ve adhar main hi sir ke bal latak gayi
 After imagining the suffering of Trishanku, Vishwamitra created heaven with the power of his penance at the same place and made a new star and a saptarshi mandala in the south direction
 iske baad unhone naye indra kii sristi karne kaa vichaar kiya jisase indra sahit sabhi devtaa bhaybheet hokar vishwamitra se anunay vinay karne lage
 He said that we had returned the hungus only because they could not live in heaven due to the curse of the Guru
 indra kii baat sun kar vishwamitra ji bole ki maine ise swarg bhejne kaa vachan diya he isaliye mere dwaara banaaya gaya yah swarg mandal hameshaa rahegaa or trishanku sadaa is nakshatra mandal main amar hokar rajya karegaa
 Satisfied with this, the gods of Indra went back to their respective places
 devataaon ke chale jane ke baad vishwamitra bhi brahman kaa pad praapt karne ke liye purv disha main jaakar kathor tapasya karne lage
 न There were many types of obstacles present to break this austerity, but they removed them all without getting angry
 tapasya kii avadhi samaapt hone par jab ve ann grahan karne ke liye baithe, tabhi brahman bhikshuk ke rup main aakar indra ne bhojan kii yachana kii
 Vishwamitra gave the entire meal to the petitioner and remained selfless
 indra ko bhojan dene ke pashchaat vishwamitra ke man main vichaar aayaa ki sambhavat: abhi mere bhojan grahan karne kaa samay nahin aayaa he isiliye yaachak ke rup main yah wipro upasthit ho gaya,mujhe abhi or tapasya karnaa chaiye
 Therefore, he remained silent and absorbed in long-term penance
 is baar unhone pranayam se shwaas roak kar mahadarun tap kiya
 The deities affected by this tenacity requested Brahma that God! Vishwamitra's penance has now reached a climax
 ab ve krodh or moh kii simaaon ko paar kar gayi hai
 Now the whole world has been illuminated by their glory
 surya or chandramaa kaa tej bhi inke tej ke saamne feekaa pad gaya he
 Therefore, if you are happy, fulfill their desire
 devataaon ke in vachanon ko sunakar brahma ji unhen brahman kii oopaadhi pradaan kii kintu vishwamitra ne kaha ki he bhagwan! jab aapane mujhe yah vardaan diya he to mujhe onkaar, shatkaar tathaa chaaron veda bhi pradaan kijiye
 God i will consider my penance to be successful only when Vashistha ji considers me a Brahmin and a Brahmarshi
 vishwamitra kii baat sun kar sab devataaon ne vashishtha ji kaa paas jaakar unhen sara vrittant sunaaya
 After listening to the story of his penance, Vashistha reached Vishwamitra and with his heart he said that Vishwamitra! You are truly Brahmarshi
 main aaj se aapako brahman sweekaar karata hoon

 Waves are of two main types: tarkdwar yaa logic get vah yukti he jiskaa output uske input par upasthit vartmaan sanketon yaa purv sanketon kaa koi logical falan ho

 Algorithms that can be described by boolean logic can also be given to form those algorithms from these physical gates
 jis prakaar ek darwaja do avasthaaon - 'khulaa yaa band' main ho saktaa he, usee tarah logic get kaa output bhi 'hai yaa lo' ho saktaa he
 Logic can be as simple as gate, end and or, and as complex as a computer

 The logic family built using bipolar transistors is called resistor-transistor logic

 But due to its high impedance state, these devices are used to send data from various devices on the data bus
 jo yukti bas ko data bhej rahi hoti he, usko chhodkar us bas se judi anya sabhi yuktiyon ko 'hai impidence state' main kar diya jaataa he
 Thus, these other devices are also different from being connected to the bus in a way because 'high impedance' exists between the bus and its output
 tarksangat dwaar do prakaar ke hote hai - sangyojan tark tathaa anukramik tark
 The output of a combinational logic depends only on the current state of its inputs and not on their earlier state or stages
 duusare shabdon main kah sakate hai ki inamen smriti nahin hoti
 Some examples of this are - binary adapter, encoder, decoder etc
 logic dwaaron kaa upyog ankada-bhandaran ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Latch circuit or 'flip-flop' is used for this
 jab kai flip-flop ko samaantar main jod dete hai to isamen bahu-bit data store kiya ja saktaa he
 This is called a register
 flip-flopon se yukt pranali main ek prakaar kii 'smriti' maujuud he
 That is why computer memory is made from them

 Any other logic gate can be used using only NOR or only NAND
 isaliye in logic dwaaron ko 'universal logic get' kehete hai
 It is not possible to create any logic function as desired using only AND, or only OR, or only NOT gates
 isaliye AND, OR or NOT get 'universal logic get' nahin hai
 In order to take birth of a child, the man who is supported other than the woman is called the father
 If we look at it scientifically, the man whose birth is born in the womb of a woman is called the father
 The sex of the father depends on the type of semen

 The Raman effect is also important for understanding the internal structure of chemical compounds

 On the occasion of National Science Day, programs promoting science activities are organized in different regions of India
 60 se zyada vibhinn dravon par prayog dohraane ke baad yah sunishchit ho gaya ki sabhi drav raman spectrum darshaate hai
 Changing the fluid only changes the color of the spectral line transmitted from it
 abhi tak ke prayogon main sirf dekhakar prabhaav kii pushti kii ja rahi thi
 But Raman knew that unless the wavelengths of Raman-lines and their relative intensity were measured, neither the effect could be satisfactorily explained nor recognized in the scientific world
 iske liye unhone ek quartj spectrograph kaa upyog kiya, jiske parimanatmak parinaam march 31, 1928 ke indian jarnal of physics main prakashit hue
 This is a wonderful effect, only a decade after its discovery the internal structure of 2000 chemical compounds was determined

 According to Raman effect, the nature and nature of light changes when it passes through a transparent medium
 yah madhyam thos, drav or gasiy, kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 This phenomenon occurs when the molecules of the medium scatter particles of light energy
 yah usee tarah hota he jaise kairam board par striker gotiyon ko chhitara detaa he
 The intrinsic molecule structure of the medium can be detected by minimal changes in the photon's energy or the nature of light

 1987 se bharat main yah din rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The Raman effect can be appropriately interpreted only on the basis of quantum theory, where a monochromatic light beam is seen as the flow of particles containing energy

 ek ore saidhantik bhautikee kii drushti se is prabhaav ne kwantum bhautikee ko sudrudh aadhaar pradaan karne kaa kaary kiya to vahiin duusari ore praayogic bhautikavidon ko crystalon or anuon kii sanrachanaon ke adhyayan ke liye ek atyant daksh, saral takanic pradaan kii
 Then gradually physicists started losing interest in this new technique
 par tab tak rasayanagyon ke bich ek vishleshnatak aujaar ke rup main yah takanic lokapriy hone lagi thi
 Every substance has its own specific spectrum as a tool of chemists
 atah padaarth ko nasht kiye bina mishranon kaa bhi rasinic vishleshan is takanic dwaara kiya ja saktaa tha or padaarth carbonic ho yaa acarbonic uske hastakshar raman spectrum main pahachaane ja sakate the
 Also the presence of their relative magnitude could be estimated by comparing the intensity of the spectral lines
 yah ek vyapak takanic thi or iskaa upyog dravon ke atirikt gaison or thoson ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 But after World War II, due to the developments in sensitive detectors and electronics, scientists began to find infrared spectrometry simpler than Raman spectrometry and the trend towards applications of Raman effect decreased somewhat
 kintu lesar kii khoj ke baad 1960 se raman prabhaav phir se vaigyanik anveshakon main lokapriy ho gaya
 The most difficult problem in detecting the Raman effect was that the Raman lines were very weak, so a very strong light source was required for their detection
 lesar ne na keval aisa atyant teevr prakaash strot pradaan kiya varan prakirnit prakaash main aise nae prabhaav pravartit kiye jinhone raman spectrummiti main nae aayam jod die
 As a result, many variations of Raman spectroscopy developed
 inamen jin mul sankalpanaaon kaa upyog kiya gaya he unamem sugrahita vruddhi ke liye prishthvardhit raman, sthanik vibhedan main sudhaar ke liye raman microscopy or atyant vishisht soochna prapti ke liye rejonence raman mukhya hai
 Many different Raman spectrum techniques have been developed with the integration of these concepts
 furier roopantaran takneekon or dota prabandhan ke liye computaron kaa anuprayog jud jane ke baad 1980 ke dashak ke uttarardh se vyavsaayik raman spectrummapi uplabdh ho gaye or ab koi bhi kshetra raman prabhaav ke anuprayogon se achoota nahin rahaa he
 The Raman effect provides the most effective technique wherever a particle-specific particle can be identified and quickly extracted without damaging the sample
 abhinav raman spectrummiti ke kuch anuprayog neeche die gaye hai : The applications of Raman effect have been increasing with time and this shows the importance of the legacy of Raman effect in the 21st century

 jeev yaa aatma kaa mul swabhaan shuddh, buddha, sachchidanandmay he, keval pudgal yaa karm ke aavaran se uskaa mul swarup aachhadit ho jaataa he
 At the time when this plant load is removed, the soul attains the higher state of God
 jain mat 'syadwad' ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 Syadvad means polytheism, that is, relative acceptance of different religions, such as continualism and impermanence, resemblance and disharmony, sattva and asattva, eligibility and indescribability in the same substance
 is mat ke anusaar akaash se lekar deepak paryant samast padaarth nityatv or anityatv aadi ubhay dharm yukt he
 There are 24 Tirthankaras considered in Jainism
 tirthankar dharm tirth kaa pravartan karte he
 There are 24 Tirthankaras of this period - rishabhdev, arishtanemi aadi tirthankarasn kaa ullekh rigvedadi main bahulata se miltaa he, jisase yah swatah siddh hota he ki vedon kii rachana ke pehle jain-dharm kaa astitv bharat main tha
 Vishnu Purana mentions Sri Rishabhdev, Manusmriti's first Jin Skandpuran, Lingapuran, etc
, the twenty-second Tirthankara Arishtanemi
 diksha murti-sahasranam, vaishampayan sahasranam mahimna stotra main bhagwaan jineshwar va arhant kah ke stuti kii gai he
 In Yoga Vashishta, Shriram wishes for peace like the 'jin' God
 isi tarah rudrayamalatantr main bhavani ko jineshvari, jinamata, jinendra kahkar sambodhan kiya he
 In Nagar Purana, the fruit of giving food to a Jain sage in Kali-yuga is said to be equivalent to feeding ten Brahmins in Kritayuga

 The birth of Mahavira is dated to 599 years before Christ
 shesh ke vishay main anek prakaar kii aloqik or prakrutiviruddh kathaayen hai
 The story of Rishabhdev has appeared in many Puranas etc
 and they are counted in 24 incarnations of Hindus
 mahabharat anushaasan parv, mahabharat shantiparv, skandh puraana, prabhas puraana, lankavatar aadi anek grantho main arishtanemi kaa ullekh he
 In Jainism, non-violence is considered to be the ultimate religion
 sab jeev jeena chaahate hai, maranaa koi nahin chahta, atev is dharm main pranivadh ke tyaag kaa sarvapratham upadesh he
 It is not only the killing of the souls, but also the untruthful speech which hurts others, is also described as a part of violence
 mahavir ne apane bhikshuon ko upadesh dete hue kaha he ki unhen bolte-chaalate, uthte-baithte, sote or khate-pite sadaa ytnsheel rahanaa chahie
 Attachment is a violence in the works of rituals, so conquering the disorders, suppressing the senses and narrowing all your instincts is called true non-violence in Jainism
 prithvi, jal, agni, vaayu or vanaspati main bhi jivan he, atev prithvi aadi akendriya jeevon kii hinsa kaa bhi is dharm main nishedh he
 The second important principle of Jainism is karma
 mahavir ne baar baar kaha he ki jo jaisaa acha, bura karm karata he uskaa fal avashya hi bhogana padataa he tathaa manushya chaahe jo praapt kar saktaa he, chaahe jo ban saktaa he, isaliye apane bhagya kaa vidhaataa vah swayan he
 In Jainism, God is not considered to be the doer of the world, through austerities etc
, the Supreme state of self-development has been described as God
 yahan nity, ek athwa mukt ishwar ko athwa avatharavaad ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 With the destruction of these eight deeds of knowledge, sight-seeing, altariness, infatuation, age, name and gotra, when the creature is freed from the bondage of karma, then he becomes God and due to being freed from raga-malice, that creation Does not fall into the greatness of jaindharm main jeev, pudgal, dharm, adharm, akaash or kaal naam ke chha: dravya maane gaye hai
 These matter are found in Lokakash, there is only sky in Alokakash
 jeev, ajeev, asrav, bandha sanvar, nirjara or moksh ye saat tatv he
 Adoration of these elements leads to attunement
 samyagdarshan ke baad samyaggyaan or phir vrath, tap, sanyam aadi ke paalan karne se samyakcharitra utpann hota he
 These three gems have been described as the path of salvation
 ratnatray kii purnataa praapt kar lene par moksh kii prapti hoti he
 On salvation, the organism is freed from the bondage of all actions, and due to the upward movement, it is situated on the siddhashila in the front of the world
 use anant darshan, anant gyaan, anant sukh or anant veery kii prapti hoti he or vah antkaal tak vahaan nivas karata he, vahaan se lautakar nahin aata
 Anekantavada is the third main principle of Jainism
 ise ahimsa kaa hi vyapak rup samajhnaa chahie
 The subject of misunderstanding of the rage, of the rites, to understand the vision of another properly, is the name of pluralism
 isse manushya satya ke nikat pahunch saktaa he
 According to this theory, no belief or principle can be said to be completely true
 prayek mat apni apni paristhitayon or samasyaon ko lekar udbhoot hua he, atev prayek mat main apni apni visheshtaayen hai
 The polytheist proceeds by coordinating them all
 aage chalakar jab is siddhant ko taarkik rup diya gaya to yah syadwad naam se kaha jane laga tathaa, syat asti', 'syat naasti', syat asti naasti', 'syat avaktavy,' 'syat asti avaktavy', 'syat naasti avaktavy' or 'syat asti naasti avaktavy', in saat bhaagon ke kaaran saptabhangi naam se prasiddh hua
 Jainism emphasizes self-purification
 aatmshuddhi praapt karne ke liye jain dharm main deh-daman or kshtshishnutaa ko mukhya mana gaya he
 The ascetic Mahavir used to roam in a naked state due to being silent and impassive
 yah bahya tap bhi antarang shuddhi ke liye hi kiya jaataa tha
 It is said in ancient Jain sources that even if someone remains in a naked state or fasts for a month, but if he has maya in his mind, he is not going to get perfection
 jain aachaar-vichaar ke paalan karne ko 'shuron kaa maarg' kaha gaya he
 Just as chewing iron gram, eating sand of grass, crossing the sea with arms and walking on the edge of a sword is difficult, the conduct of the discourse is also said to be incurable
 buddha dharm kii bhanti jain dharm main bhi jatibhed ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 The ancient Jain texts state that the true Brahmin is the one who has conquered raga, malice and fear and who has control over his senses
 jain dharm main apane apane karmon ke anusaar hi brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra kii kalpana kii gai he, kisi jati vishesh main utpann hone se nahin
 Mahavira had initiated many mlechha, thieves, bandits, fishermen, prostitutes and Chandalputras into Jainism
 is prakaar ke anek kathanak jain granthon main paae jate hai
 All the Tirthankars of Jainism took place in the Kshatriya clan
 isse maaloom hota he ki purvakaal main jain dharm kshatriyon kaa dharm tha, lekin aajkal adhikansh vaisya log hi iske anuyaayi hai
 By the way, how many Jains do farming business in South India like Setwal etc
 panchamon main brahman, kshatriya or vaisya in teenon varnon ke dhandhe karanevaale log paae jate hai
 Except for the followers of the Jinsen Math, the followers of any monastery are not called ivs
 chaturth log saadharantaya kheti or jameendaari karte hai
 In Satara and Bijapur districts, many followers of Jainism practice julaha, chhupi, tailor, goldsmith and kasare etc
 jain granthon main saat tattvon kaa varnan miltaa hai
 These are jain dharm main shravak or muni donon ke liye paanch vrath bataae gaye he
 The great men who follow the Tirthankaras are called Mahavrata - muni in vraton kaa sookshm rup se paalan karte he, vahi shravak sthool rup se karte he
 According to Jain texts, Jiva and Ajiva are the two main substances
 asrav, bandh, sanvar, nirjara, moksh, punya, paap ajeev dravya ke bhed hai
 According to Jainism, folk is made up of 6 liquids
 yah 6 dravya shaashvat hai arthath inako banaaya yaa mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 This is Jiva, Pudgal, Dharma, Unrighteousness, Akash and Kaal
 yah ratnatray aatma ko chhodkar anya kisi dravya main nahin rahata
 There are eight parts of Samyaktva - Disarmament, Discontinuity, Nirvikikitsattva, Amodrishtitva, Upabhumna / Upaguhana, Situation, Influence, Vatsalya

 ahimsa or jeev dayaa par bahut jor diya jaataa he
 All Jains are vegetarian
 anekaantwaad kaa arth he- ek hi vastu main paraspar virdohi anek dharm yugalon kaa sweekaar
 Syadvad means the rendering of many religions that are objectified by different expectations
 jain dharm kaa param pavitra or anadi moolmantra he- That is to say hello to the Arihants, hello to the Siddhas, hello to the Acharyas, hello to the Upadhyas, hello to all the Sadhus
 ye panch parameshthi hai
 Just as Kaal is divided in Manvantar kalpa etc
 in Hindus, similarly Kaal in Jain is of two types - Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 avasarpini kaal main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan,aayu,bal ityadi ghatata he jabaki utsarpini main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan or aayu, bal ityadi badhata he in donon kaa kaalmaan das krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he arthath ek samaychakra bees krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he
 Each Tirthankara, 12 Chakravarti, 9 Baldev, 9 Narayana and 9 Pratinarayana are born in each Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 inhen tristh shlakapurush kaha jaataa he
 The 24 Tirthankaras counted above belong to the present Avasarpini
 prayek utsirpini yaa avasarpini main nae nae jeev tirthankar hua karte hai
 With the teachings of these Tirthankaras, Ganadhar people make twins
 ye hi dwadashang jain dharm ke mul granth maane jate he
 How ancient Jainism is, cannot be said exactly
 jain grantho ke anusaar jain dharm anadikaal se he
 Mahavir Swami or Vardhaman attained nirvana 527 years before Christ
 isi samay se peeche kuch log visheshkar european vidvan jain dharm kaa prachlit hona maanate hai
 The Jains have divided their texts into Agam, Purana etc
 pro jecobi aadi ke aadhunik anveshanon ke anusaar yah siddh kiya gaya he kii jain dharm buddha dharm se pehle kaa he
 The antiquity of Jainism is also found from the inscriptions of Udayagiri, Junagadh etc
 hindu granth, skanda puraana ke anusaar: "rishabhdev nabhiraj ke putr the, rishabh ke putr bharat the, or inke hi naam par is desh kaa naam "bharatvarsh" padaa"| In Indian astrology, the style of the Greeks propagated three hundred years behind the Vikram Samvat
 par jainon ke mul granth angon main yavan jyotish kaa kuch bhi abhas nahin he
 Just as the Ved Samhita of the Brahmins has a five-year age and constellations are counted from the Kritika, similarly the Jana texts are also in the scriptures
 isse unki pracheenta siddh hoti he
 After Lord Mahavira, there have been many sages and acharyas in this tradition, the main of which are- tirthankar mahavir ke samay tak avichhin rahi jain parampara isa kii teesri sadi main do bhaagon main vibhakt ho gayi : digambar or shwetambar
 Muni Pramanasagar ji has written in detail on this division of Jains in his work 'jainism and Philosophy' that Acharya Bhadrabahu knew on the strength of his knowledge that a severe famine of 12 years is going to happen in North India, so he gave all the sadhus Instructed that to avoid this terrible famine, one should travel to South India
 acharya bhadrabahu ke saath hajaaron jain muni dakshin kii ore vartmaan ke tamilnadu or karnataka kii ore prasthaan kar gaye or apni sadhana main lage rahe
 But some Jain monks stayed in North India itself
 akaal ke kaaran yahan ruke hue saadhuon kaa nirvaah aagmanuroop nahin ho paa rahaa tha isliye unhone apni kai kriyaayein shithil kar leen, jaise kati vastra dhaaran karnaa, 7 gharon se bhiksha grahan karnaa, 14 upkaran saath main rakhana aadi
 After 12 years, the sadhus who returned from the south saw all this and they explained to the sadhus residing here that you once again adopted the tradition of Tirthankara Mahavir, but the sadhus did not agree and then Digambara and Shvetambara became two sects in Jainism
 digambar sadhu vastra nahin pahante he, nagn rahete hai or sadhviyaan shwet vastra dhaaran karti hai
 In Digambar Matha, the idols of the Tirthakaras are made completely naked and they are not adorned
 digambar samudaay teen bhaagon vibhakt hai
 Shwetambars and Sadhvis and Saints wear white robes, idols of Tirthakaras are made and decorated with metal eyes, coils on the idol
 shwetambar bhi do bhaag me vibhakt he: Sthanavasi also has two parts: - digambar aacharyon dwaara samast jain aagam grantho ko chaar bhaago main baanta gaya he - Elementary Sutra - Granth accepted by all Jains pramukh jain granth hai :- Kalpasutra jain dharm ke pramukh tyohaar is prakaar hai

 There was a wonderful confluence of valor and scholarship
 unke shasr gyaan or shasr gyaan kii koi seemaa nahin thi
 He used to spend his time in the study of scriptures often from the reigns and for this purpose he built a huge library in a part of the palace
 ve ek din ek dharmik granth pard rahe the to unhen ek jagah raja bali kaa prasang mila
 When he read the entire episode of Raja Bali, it came to know that King Bali was very strong and strong in word
 ve itane parakramee or mahaan raja the ki indra unki shakti se dar gaye
 The gods prayed to Lord Vishnu that if they do some measure of sacrifice, then Vishnu took the form of Vamana
 vaaman rup dharkar unase sab kuch daan main praapt kar liya or unhen pataal lok jane ko vivash kar diya
 When Vikram read his story, he thought that he should definitely visit such a big donor
 unhone vichaar kiya ki bhagwaan vishnu kii aradhana karke unhen prasann kiya jaae tathaa unase daityaraj bali se milane kaa maarg poocha jaae
 As soon as such thoughts came to mind, he separated himself from the Raj-pat and moh-maya and left the royalty and handed over the Rajbhar to the forest
 jangal main unhone ghor tapasya shuru kii or bhagwaan vishnu kii stuti karne lage
 His penance was very long
 shuru main ve keval ek samay kaa bhojan karte the
 After a few days they gave up that too and started eating fruits and tubers etc
 kuch dinon baad sab kuch tyaag diya or keval pani pikar tapasya karte rahe
 Due to such austerity, he became very weak and even getting up and sitting was very difficult
 dhire-dhire unke tapasya sthal ke paas or bhi bahut saare tapasvi aa gaye
 Some stood on one leg and started doing austerities, while some lifted one hand, some fell on the thorns and became engrossed in austerities, some got stuck in the sand till the neck
 chaaron ore sirf ishwar ke naam kii charchaa hone lagi or pavitra vaataavaran taiyaar ho gaya
 After some time Vikram also stopped taking water and started doing severe austerities
 ab unka sharir or bhi kamazor ho gaya or sirf haddiyon kaa dhaanchaa na aane laga
 Someone would have felt pity, but King Vikramaditya had no concern
 vishnu kii aradhana karte-karte yadi unke praan nikal jate to sidhe swarg jate or yadi vishnu ke darshan ho jate to daityaraj bali se milane kaa maarg prashast hota
 He was diligently seeking his desired purpose
 jivan or sharir kaa unhen koi moh nahin rahaa
 King Vikramaditya's hulia had become such that no one could see and say that he was the greatest and the best
 raja ke sameep hi tapasya karne vaale ek yogi ne unase poocha ki ve itani ghor tapasya kyon kar rahe hai
 Vikram's reply was- "for liberation from Ihloka and reform of the hereafter
" " tapasvi ne unhen kaha ki tapasya raajaaon kaa kaam nahin he
 The king is born by God to the kingdom and that is his karma
 agar vah raaj-kaaj se munh modta he to apane karm se munh modta he
 It is said in the scriptures that a man should not turn away from his karma
 vikram ne bade hi gambhir swar main usase kaha ki karm karte hue bhi dharm se kabhi munh nahin modana chahie
 When he asked him if the scriptures had asked him to turn away from religion in any situation, the ascetic became completely silent
 unke tarkpurna uttar ne use aage kuch poochne laayak nahin choda
 The king continued his penance
 atyadhik nirbalata ke kaaran ek din raja behosh ho gaye or kaaphi der ke baad hosh main aae
 The ascetic once again came to him and asked him to give up his penance
 usne kaha ki chunki raja grihasth hai, isliye tapasviyon kii bhanti unhen tap nahin karnaa chahie
 The householder should do penance by staying within a limit
 jab usne raja ko baar-baar grihasth dharm kii yaad dilaai or grihasth karm ke liye prerit kiya to raja ne kaha ki ve man kii shaanti ke liye tapasya kar rahe hai
 The ascetic did not say anything and he started doing penance again
 kamazori to thi hi- ek baar phir ve achet ho gaye
 When he came to his senses after several hours, he found that his head is in the lap of Lord Vishnu
 unhen bhagwaan vishnu ko dekhakar pataa chal gaya ki tapasya se rokane vaala tapasvi or koi nahin swayan bhagwaan vishnu the
 Vikram got up and prostrated him, then God asked why he is doing such austere penance
 vikram ne kaha ki unhen raja bali se bhent kaa rasta pataa karnaa he
 Lord Vishnu gave him a conch and said that there is a way to go to Hades in the middle of the sea
 is shankh ko samudr tat par phunkane ke baad unhen samudr dev ke darshan honge or vahi unhen raja bali tak pahunchne kaa maarg batalaayenge
 Vishnu disappeared by giving a conch
 vishnu ke darshan ke baad vikram ne phir se tapasya ke pehle vaala swasthya praapt kar liya or waisi hi aseem shakti praapt kar lee
 Taking the conch, they came near the sea and started blowing the conch with full power
 samudr dev upasthit hue or samudr kaa pani do bhaagon main vibhakt ho gaya
 The land route was now visible in the middle of the sea
 us maarg par raja aage badhate rahe
 After a lot of walking, he reached Hades
 jab ve raja bali ke mahal ke dwaar par pahunche to dwarapaalon ne unase aane kaa prayojan poocha
 Vikram tells him that the king has come to the mortuary to see Bali
 ek sainik unka sandesh lekar gaya or kaaphi der baad unase aakar bolaa ki raja bali abhi unase nahin mil sakate hai
 He repeatedly requested to meet the king but King Bali was not ready
 raja ne khinn or hataash hokar apni talwaar se apana sar kaat liya
 When the guards sent this news to King Bali, they brought Amrit to life and made Vikram alive
 jivit hote hi vikram ne phir raja bali ke darshan kii ichha jataai
 This time the sentinel returned with the message that Raja Bali would meet him on the day of Maha Shivaratri
 vikram ko laga ki bali ne sirfe taalane ke liye yah sandesh bhijwaya he
 His heart hurt and he then cut his neck with a sword
 prahariyon main khalabali sach gai or unhone raja bali tak vikram ke balidaan kii khabar pahunchaai
 King Bali understood that the person was determined and not to be presented
 unhone phir naukaron dwaara amrit bhijwaya or unke liye sandesh bhijwaya ki bhent karne ko ve raji hai
 The servants sprinkled nectar and brought them to life and asked them to walk in the palace with sacrifice
 jab ve raja bali se mili to raja bali ne unase itnaa ksht uthaakar aane kaa kaaran poocha
 Vikram said that a lot has been described about him in religious texts and his charity and sacrifice are discussed everywhere, so he was eager to meet them
 raja bali unase bahut prasann hue tathaa vikram ko ek laal moonga uphaar main diya or bole ki vah moonga maangane par har vastu de saktaa he
 Even impossible tasks can be possible on the strength of coral
 vikram raja bali se vidaa lekar prasann chitt hokar mrityulok kii ore laut chale
 Outside the entrance of Hades, again the same infinite depth sea was flowing
 unhone bhagwaan vishnu kaa diya hua shankh phunkaa to samudr phir se do bhaagon main bant gaya or uske bichon-bich vahi bhoomivaala maarg prakat ho gaya
 By walking on that land route, they reached the beach
 vah maarg gaayab ho gaya tathaa samudr phir purvavat hokar bahane laga
 They started towards their kingdom
 raste main unhen ek sree vilaap karti mili
 His hair was shattered and there was deep sadness on his face
 paas aane par pataa chalaa ki uske pati kii mrityu ho gai he or ab vah bilkul besahaara he
 Vikram's heart was troubled to see her sorrow and they comforted him
 bali vaale muunge se uske liye jivan daan maanga
 He had to say that the dead husband of that widow got up and sat down as if awakened from deep sleep
 sree ke anand kii seemaa nahin rahi

 haalanki, byaaj dar vinimay ke vipareet, mudra vinimay main mooldhan kaa vinimay shaamil ho saktaa he
 There are three different ways to exchange debt through currency exchange: sabase saral mudra vinimay sanrachana keval mooldhan kaa pratipaksh ke saath, is samay sweekrut dar par, bhavishya main kisi nishchit samay main vinimay karnaa he
 Such an agreement carries out a work equivalent to a futures contract or futures contract
 ek pratipaksh praapt karne kii laagat kaa pataa lagaana, evam unke saath samjhauta karnaa, laghu avadhi ke agaau vinimay daron ko nishchit karne kii ek vidhi ke rup main vaikalpik vyutpannon kii tulana main vinimay ko adhik mahangaa bana detaa he
 However, for more long-term futures, typically up to 10 years, where derivatives options are however broad for long-term futures, typically up to 10 years where the difference in buy-sell rates is higher for alternative derivatives While widespread, only principal currency exchanges are often used as an economical way of setting forward rates
 mudra vinimay ke is rup ko epa-eks -vinimay ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Another currency exchange structure is to mix the above principal debt with the interest rate exchange
 aise vinimay main, byaaj ke nakad pravaah kaa pratipaksh ko bhugtan karne ke purv unamem se kharch kii katautee nahin kii jaati he kyonki vibhinn mudraon main un par adhikaar rakhaa jaataa he
 Since each party successfully borrows on behalf of the other party, such exchange is also called back-to-back lending
 yahaan sabase ant main, lekin nishchit rup se kam mahatvapurn nahin, samaan aakaar evam avadhi vaale rin ke liye keval byaaj bhugtan nakad pravaah kaa vinimay karnaa he
 Again, since it is a currency exchange, the cash flows exchanged are in different denominations and hence expenses are not deducted from them
 aise hi ek vinimay kaa udhaaharan niyat-dar vaale america dollar ke byaaj ke bhugtan kaa euro main asthaayee-dar vaale byaaj bhugtan ke saath vinimay karnaa he
 This type of exchange is also known as cross-currency interest rate exchange, or cross-currency exchange
 mudra vinimay ke do mukhya upyog hai: For example, a company based in the US requiring a Swiss franc loan and a company based in Switzerland requiring a loan of the same current value in US dollars , both companies adopting either of the following rates of exchange rates May reduce your risk of fluctuations: mul rup se mudra vinimay kii kalpana 1970 main united kingdom main videshi mudra niyantranon se bachane ke liye kii gai thi
 At that time, UK companies had to pay a premium to take a US dollar loan
 isse bachane ke liye, britain kii companiyon ne sterling chaahane vaali sanyukt rajya america kii companiyon ke saath aage-peeche rin samjhaute kiye
 jabaki mudra vinimay par is tarah ke pratibandh durlabh ho chuke hai, tulanaatmak laabh ke kaaran aage-peeche rin se abhi bhi bachat uplabdh hai
 Cross-currency interest rate exchange was done in 1981 by Bank World to exchange Swiss cash and Swiss currency and German mark
 is saude par solomons bros ne 210 million dollars kii anumaanit raashi evam das varshon se adhik kii avadhi ke liye samjhauta kiya
 During the 2008 global financial crisis, the currency exchange transaction structure was used by the United States Federal Accumulation System to establish a central bank liquidity exchange
 inamen, ek viksit yaa sthir rup se ubhartee arthvyavastha ke fedral rigerv or kendriya bank vartmaan prachlit bazaar maujuuda vinimay dar par gharelu mudraon kaa vinimay karne ke liye taiyaar hote hai evam samaan mudra vinimay dar par bhavishya kii ek niyat tithi par vinimay ko waapas karne ke liye sahamat ho jate hai
 The purpose of the central bank liquidity exchange is to "provide liquidity to American dollars to foreign markets"
 jabaki kendriya bank taralata vinimay or mudra vinimay sanrachanaatmak rup se samaan hai, mudra vinimay tulanaatmak laabh se prerit vanijyik lenden he, jabaki kendriya bank taralata vinimay videshi bazaaron main amareeki dollaron ke apati rin hai or vartmaan main yah gyaat nahin he ki dirghakaalin rup main ve dollar yaa sanyukt rakya america ke liye laabhprad honge yaa nahin
 The Chinese Democratic Republic has multi-year currency exchange agreements for renminbi with Argentina, Belarus, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea that function in the same way as the central bank liquidity exchange

 Through the Inter-caste Marriage Development Institute and its journalism, i worked to eliminate the first growing ethnicity and communality in India
 Even after keeping some people of Indian ideology, people have kept ethnicity and touched-up in their cinemas, even today, the shadow of touch-touching is visible everywhere
 Today, even inter-caste marriages are not held respectfully in India
 Inter-caste marriages today are also subjected to unjust atrocities
 They work for the upliftment and the upliftment of wool
 Untouchability has been abolished from India as per the Indian Constitution Code 17, but even today we have ethnicity like Vile overlaps Gujrana of things

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european
 hind europea parivaar kii kai shakhaayen hai
 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches
 sanskrit isi varg main aati he
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans
 ek vichaardhaara ke mutabik aaryon kii janmabhumi madhya asia main thi, shaayad dakshini rus yaa caspian sagar ke aas-paas
 From there his clan reached many countries of the world
 hind-arya kabeelon kaa bhartiya upmahadweep main pravaas dhire-dhire or shantipurvak hua tha or british itihaaskaaron kii "koon-kharabe" vaali baton kaa koi pramaan nahin he
 At that time, the indus-valley civilization was destroyed either by earthquakes or by changes in the current of indus-saraswati rivers and due to drought
 ye vichaardhaara aajkal duniya ke adhiktam bhashavid or itihaaskaar maanate hai
 The "kurgan tomb-mounds" of Central Asia are believed to have been created by the ancient Aryans
 ek duusari vichaardhaara ke anusaar pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bharat hi he or yaheen se arya kabeeley europe or baaki asia main pravaas kiye
 This view is considered by many Indians and Hindutva-plaintiffs, but in the rest of the world, this view is not valued
 adhiktar bhashavidon ke anusaar "aadim-hind-europea" bhashaa ke punarnirmit shabd yahi ishaara karte hai ki pracheen arya janmasthan ek vishaal, shitoshna ghaas kaa charaagaah tha
 By the way, there are no similar words found in Greek, Latin, German and other indo-european languages for the words of Indian climate and animals, such as peacock, cock, tiger, elephant, mango, banana, peepal, banyan, neem, hot Mausam, ganda, buffalo, rice, etc
