 is kaary samooh ne vinirdesh ke pehle public varking draft ko 22 janvari 2008 main prakashit kiya tha
 The specification work is an ongoing task and is expected to remain so for many years, although parts of HTML5 are expected to be finished before the entire specification reaches the final recommended level and in browsers They can be implemented
 W3C samay saarini ke anusaar, yah anumaan he ki achtmal5 W3C anushansa tak 2010 tak pahunch jaayegaa
 However, the first public working draft was able to arrive 8 months after its expected date and the last call and candidate recommendation was expected to reach 2008, but as of July 2010, HTML5, W3C still has working draft levels
 But only
 achtmal5, oktober 2009 se WHATWG main antim kol str par he
 The editor of the HTML5 specification Ian Hixon hopes that these specifications will reach Candidate Recommendation Level during 2012
 The following criteria are required for these specifications to become W3C recommendations - "two 100% complete and fully interconnected implementations"
 In an interview with techpublic, Hixon speculates that this will likely happen in the year 2022 or later
 However, many parts of the specification are static and can be implemented in products: Some sections are already relatively stable and there are implementations that are already quite close to completion, and those features can be used today

 He had the power of Shukracharya
 isi bich durvasa rishi ke shaap se devraj indra shaktiheen ho gayi the
 The kingdom of the demon king Bali was on all three worlds
 indra sahit devatagan usase bhaybheet rahete the
 Only Baikunthanath Vishnu could tell the solution of this situation, so all the gods along with Brahma reached Lord Narayana
 unki stuti karke unhone bhagwaan vishnu ko apni vipadaa sunai
 Then God said in sweet voice that this is a time of crisis for you
 daityon, asuron evam daanvon kaa abhyutthan ho rahaa he or tum logon kii avnati ho rahi he
 But the crisis period should be spent in a friendly manner
 tum daityon se mitrataa kar lo or ksheer sagar ko math kar usamen se amrit nikaal kar paan kar lo
 With the help of the demons, this work will be done smoothly
 is kaary ke liye unki har shart maan lo or ant main apana kaam nikaal lo
 By drinking nectar you will become immortal and you will have the ability to kill the demons

 The demon king Bali compromised with Devraj Indra and got ready for churning the sea
 mandarachal parvat ko mathni tathaa vasuki naag ko neti banaaya gaya
 The leader emerged from Vasuki's eye
 swayan bhagwaan shri vishnu kacchap avatar lekar mandarachal parvat ko apane peeth par rakhkar uskaa aadhaar ban gayi
 Lord Narayana exerted power demonically in the demons and devoutly in the gods
 vasuki naag ko bhi gahan nidra de kar uske ksht ko har liya
 The god began to hold Vasuki Nag on his face
 is par ulti buddhi vaale daitya, asur, daanavaadi ne sochaa ki vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney main avashya kuch na kuch laabh hoga
 He told the gods that we are not inferior in power to anyone, we will take the place of mouth
 tab devataaon ne vasuki naag ke punch kii ore kaa sthaan le liya
 "the sea churning began and the Mandarachal mountain began to roam on the broad back of the Lord Kachhapa
 he rajan! samudr manthan se sabase pehle jal kaa halaahal vish niklaa
 All the gods and demons started burning with the flame of that poison and their ears began to fade
 is par sabhi ne milakar bhagwaan shankar kii prarthana kii
 On his prayer, Mahadev ji kept the poison on his palm and drank it but did not let it come down from the gorge
 us kalkut vish ke prabhaav se shiv ji kaa kanth nila pad gaya
 That is why Mahadev ji is called Neelkanth
 unki hatheli se thodaa sa vish prithvi par tapak gaya tha jise saanp, bichchhu aadi vifaille jantuon ne grahan kar liya
 "after consuming the poison by Lord Shankar, the ocean churning started again
 doosraa ratna kamdhenu gaay nikali jise rishiyon ne rakh liya
 Then a high horse came out which was kept by Daityaraja Bali
 uske baad airavat hathi niklaa jise devraj indra ne grahan kiya
 After Airavat, Lord Vishnu kept it out of the sea of kaustubhamani

 Then after one moon, Parijat tree and conch came out and in the end Dhanvantari Vaidya appeared after taking the nectar
 "dhanvantari ke haath se amrit ko daityon ne chin liya or uske liye aapas main hi ladane lage
 The gods did not have the power to curse Durvasa so that they could fight the demons and take that nectar, so they stood frustrated and watched them fight among themselves
 devataaon kii niraashaa ko dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu tatkaal mohini rup dhaaran kar aapas main ladate daityon ke paas ja pahunche
 Seeing that Vishwamohini form, what is the matter of the demons and the Gods, the Brahmins, the devouring Kamdev himself, Lord Shankar too were fascinated and looked at him again and again
 jab daityon ne us navyauvana sundari ko apni ore aate huye dekha tab ve apana sara jhagada bhul kar usee sundari kii ore kamaskt hokar ekatak dekhne lage
 The monster said, "oh beautiful! Who are you? Looks like we are being sarcastic on us only to settle our dispute
 aao shubhage! tumhaara swaagat he
 Make us beautiful and make this nectar with lotus
 " is par vishwamohini rupi vishnu ne kaha, "he devataaon or daanvon! aap donon hi maharishi kashyap ji ke putr hone ke kaaran bhai-bhai ho phir bhi paraspar ladate ho
 i am an arbitrary woman
 budhimaan log aisi stri par kabhi vishwaas nahin karte, phir tum log kaise mujh par vishwaas kar rahe ho? acha yahi he ki swayan sab mil kar amritpan kar lo
 " vishwamohini ke aise niti kushal vachan sun kar un kamandh daityo, daanvon or asuron ko us par or bhi vishwaas ho gaya
 He said, "beautiful! We have full faith in you
 tum jis prakaar baantogi ham usee prakaar amritpan kar lenge
 Take this event and distribute nectar among all of us
 " vishwamohini ne amrit ghat lekar devataaon or daityon ko alag-alag panktiyo main baithne ke liye kaha
 After that, the demons plastered with their sarcasm and began to make nectar to the gods
 daitya unke kataaksh se aise madahosh huye ki amrit pinaa hi bhul gayi
 God considered this trick as a monster named Rahu
 vah devtaa kaa rup bana kar devataaon main jaakar baith gaya or praapt amrit ko mukh main daal liya
 When the nectar reached its gorge, the moon and the sun called out and said that it is Rahu monster
 yah sunakar bhagwaan vishnu ne tatkaal apane sudarshan chakra se uskaa sir gardan se alag kar diya
 Due to the effect of nectar, his head and torso became two planets named Rahu and Ketu and were established in space
 ve hi bair bhav ke kaaran surya or chandramaa kaa grahan karaate hai
 In this way, Lord Vishnu was omitted from there by giving nectar to the gods
 unke lop hote hi daityon kii madhoshi samaapt ho gai
 They became very angry and started attacking the gods

 The following methods are mainly used in microcosm: atisookshm rasayan main sarvapratham aaytanon ke maapan par aadhaarit vidhiyon kaa hi upyog hua
 All devices used in these operations, such as test tubes, beakers, pipettes and burettes, are made from hair tubes only and can be easily measured with volumes from 10-4 to 18-8 liters
 in vidhiyon kaa sarvapratham upyog jivan rasayan main hua
 For example, often all the methods of measuring the microscopic volume of blood of diseased children, separating the protein and boiling it and separating the inorganic elements, have to be done to a minimum extent

 The colors of planets and stars have different types of colors, so the rays emanating from them also have different effects

 In this way, there is a difference of about 23 degrees between the Western calculation system and the Indian calculation system

 The scholars of Falit believe that this does not make any difference in the result, because scholars of different countries have studied the effects of planets and stars with their own calculation system for this learning

 Is derived from astrology or astrology, ie "study")
 It is the set of systems, practices and opinions through which the personality, matters related to man's life and other worldly subjects are understood and interpreted based on the comparative position of celestial bodies and other related details and organized information in this context
 Is done
 jyotish jaananevaale kojyotishi yaa ek bhavishyavaktaa kaha jaataa he
 'third millennium BC 
 From its earliest recorded writings to date, many practices and applications based on the principles of astrology have been executed
 samskruti, shuruuaati khagol vigyaan or anya vidyaon ko aakaar dene main isane mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 Astrology and astronomy were often considered indistinguishable before the modern era
 bhavishya ke bare main jaananaa or divine gyaan kii prapti, khagoleey avlokan ke praathmik prerakon main se ek hai
 Since the end of the Renaissance to the end of the 18th century, astronomy began to slowly disintegrate
 faltah, khagol vigyaan ne khagoleey vastuon ke vaigyanik adhyayan or ek aise siddhant ke rup main apni ek pahchaan banaai jiskaa uski jyotishiya samaj se kuch lenaa dena nahin tha
 Astrologers believe that the movement and position of celestial bodies either directly affect the Earth or is somehow related to human scale or events experienced by humans
 aadhunik jyotishiyon dwaara jyotish ko ek pratikatmak bhashaa, ek kala ke rup main yaa bhavishyakathan, ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, jabaki bahut se vaigyanikon ne ise ek chhadam vigyaan yaa andhvishwaas kaa naam diya he
 Despite the difference in definitions, a general notion of astrology is that celestial bodies can help in understanding the events of the past and the present and the prophecy from their hierarchy
 ek matdaan main, 31% amirikiyon ne jyotish par apana vishwaas prakat kiya or ek anya adhyayan ke anusaar, 39% ne use vaigyanik mana he
 On the basis of astrology, the Shubhashubh fruit is specifically told about the position of the Grahanakshatras
 iske liye hamen sutron se ganit dwaara grah tathaa taron kii sthiti gyaat kerani padati he, athwa panchangon, yaa navik panchagon, se use gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The position of planets and constellations is variable every moment, so the impact of planets and constellations also have different types of events on every moment
 vaastavik grahasthiti gyaat karne ke liye ganit jyotish hi hamaara sahaayak he
 This results in a scientific basis for astrology
 kundali vah chakra he, jiske dwaara kisi isht kaal main raashichakr kii sthiti kaa gyaan hota he
 The zodiac is associated with the revolution cycle, whose position is not the same in different countries due to the difference in latitudes
 atev raashichakr kii sthiti jaanane ke liye sthaneey samay tathaa apane sthaan main honevaale raashiyon ke udai kii sthiti kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Our watches refer to the time of a certain post-sun sun
 isse saraniyon kii, jo panchagon main di rahati hai, sahaayta se hamen sthaneey spashtkaal gyaat karnaa hota he
 Local clarification is called ishtakal
 ishtkaal main jo raashi purv kshitij main hoti he use lagn kehete hai
 The lagna is known by the knowledge of the immediate clear sun and by the knowledge of the rise of local zodiac signs
 is prakaar raashichakr kii sthiti gyaat ho jaati he
 Lagna is also taken up in the Indian system
 paashchaatya pranali main lagn sayan liya jaataa he
 In addition, they also know the zodiacal meridians
 bhartiya pranali main lagn jis raashi main hota he use upar kii ore likhakar shesh raashiyon ko vamavart se likh dete hai
 The lagna is imagined as the first house and then the zodiac as the second house etc
 1 The number of expressions is known by the position in their horoscope
 raashiyon kaa ankon dwaara tathaa grahon ko unke aadyaksharon se vyakt kar dete hai
 The zodiac of this type is called horoscope
 bhartiya paddati main jo saat grah maane jate hai, ve hai surya, chandra, mangal aadi
 Apart from this, there are also two Tamo planets, which are called Rahu and Ketu
 rahu ko sadaa krantivrutt tathaa chandrakaksha ke arohpaat par tathaa ketu kaa avarohpaat par sthit maanate hai
 According to the sentiment, or with which the lord is situated, their fruit changes
 swabhaavat: tamograh hone ke kaaran inkaa fal ashubh hota he
 In Western system Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces have the following signs respectively
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The following signs for the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Guru, Saturn, Varuni, Varuna, and Yama respectively: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 And are used for the sun and the moon
 bhaavon kii sthiti ankon se vyakt kii jaati he
 By writing a clear lagna as the prepoint, from there, we write expressions in three parts equal to the quadrant
 grah jin raashiyon main ho un raashiyon main likh dete hai
 This is how a horoscope is called, which in English is called a horoscope
 europe main, bhartiya saat grahon ke atirikt, vaaruni, varun tathaa yama ke prabhaav kaa bhi adhyayan karte hai
 One has to study the nature of zodiac signs to know the fruit
 kundali ke vibhinn bhaavon se hamaare jivan se sambandh rakhanevaali vibhinn baton kaa pataa chalata he, jaise pratham bhav se sharir sambandhi, duusare bhav se dhan sambandhi aadi
 The lord of whatever zodiac sign is the lord of that house
 ek grah rashichkr par vibhinn prakaar se kirane phenkata he
 Therefore, the sight of the planet in the horoscope is also considered more or less complete
 grah jis grah sthaan par atyadhik prabhaav rakhata he use ucch tathaa usase saatven bhav ko uskaa neech kehete hai
 The planets are sometimes not visible to us from the Sun; Then they are called established
 isi prakaar vibhinn sthitiyon main grahon ke prabhaav ke anusaar unhen bal, yuva tathaa vruddh kehete he
 Other planets of the planets are friends or enemies due to their similarity or opposition to nature
 atev falit ke liye grahon ke balaabal ko janaa jaataa he
 The planet which is young, situated in its place or high and has a Yut or vision from its friends, has a lot of influence
 isi prakaar vah bhav jo apane swami se yut athwa drusht ho or jisamen shubh grah hon, purna fal detaa he
 In this way, the strength of planets, their position and other planets are also considered
 iske saath paristhitiyon tathaa manushya kii dasha kaa bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 For all these reasons, it is very difficult to tell the result
 jo log ganit jyotish ke gyaan ke bina fal bataate hai, ve thik nahin bataa sakate
 Since most astrologers are found to be like this, some people are beginning to doubt the scientificness of this science
 hamaare jivan ke upar sabase adhik surya tathaa chandramaa kaa prabhaav padataa he, atev paashchaatya deshon main suryasthit raashi tathaa chandrasthit raashi ko vishesh mahatv dete hai
 The Sun is reflective of the stable tendencies of the heart and the Moon's perceptual movements
 atev bharat main chandrakundali ko mahatv diya jaataa he
 Even in Western countries, people are promoting this ideology
 chunki surya athwa chandra ek raashi main bahut samay tak rahete hai, at: inaki kundaliyon se vibhinn vyaktiyon par honevaale prabhaav kaa thik adhyayan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The apparent lagna changes quickly, so the ascendant is considered to be the actual horoscope of the person
 sookshm fal ke liye hora, dreshkan, navansh kundaliyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The time and duration of giving special results of planets is also fixed
 chandranakshetra kaa vyateet tathaa sampurna bhogyakaal gyaat hone se grahadasha gyaat ho jaati he
 The planets exert their auspicious effects especially in their condition
 kisi grah kii dasha main anya grah bhi apana prabhaav dikhalaate hai
 This is called the inlet of those planets
 isi prakaar grahon kii antar, pratyantar dashaayen bhi hoti he
 From the mutual positions of the planets, a yoga is formed which has special fruit
 vah fal kis samay praapt hoga, iskaa nirnay grahon kii dasha se hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Vinshottari Mahadasha is mainly used in the Indian system
 iske anusaar prayek manushya kii aayu 120 varsh kii maanakar grahon kaa prabhaav bataaya jaataa he
 There are many branches of astrology
 paashchaatya jyotish main inaki sankhya chah he: In Indian astrology, only the Jataka and Samhita are the two main branches
 paashchaatya jyotish kii, tathaa shakhaon kaa jataka main tathaa shesh teen kaa samhita jyotish main antarbhaav ho jaataa he
 Rahu and Ketu are not real houses, they have been observed as Shadow
 grahon ki aapasi mitrataa-shatruta is prakaar he
 If 360 ° is divided by 12, then a sum is 30 °
 yadi 360° ko 27 se vibhajit kiya jaae to ek nakshatra 13°20' kaa hota he, arthath ek raashi me sava-do nakshatra hote he
 Since ancient times, deep belief in astrology was prevalent, which is also contained in the essence of Hermetic Maxim's words "as above, as below"
 tiko brahe ne jyotish par apane adhyayan main ek samaan saransh diya he: "saspisiando despisiyo", upar dekhakar bhi main niche dekhtaa hoon"
 haalanki, yah siddhant jiske anusaar swarg main ghatit ghatnaon kaa pratibimb prithvi par bhi awalokit hota he, duniya bhar main bahut si jyotish paramparaon kaa hissaa he, pashchim main aitihaasik rup se jyotish ke peeche kaam karne vaali kriyavali par jyotishiyon ke bich bahes hoti ai he
 There is also a dispute on whether the celestial bodies are just signs or are they foreshadowing events, or whether they actually conduct real events with some kind of power or mechanism
 bhale hi khagoleey yantriki or sthaliy gatiki ke bich sambandh sabase pehle isaac newton ke gurutvkarshan ke saarvbhaumik siddhant kii khoj se saamne aayaa, lekin khagoleey pindon kaa gurutvkarshan hi unke jyotish prabhaav ko janm detaa he yah baat kisi vaigyanik anusandhan dwaara nahin kahi gai, na hi kisi jyotish ne iskaa samarthan kiya
 Most astrological traditions are based on the relative position and motion of real or approximate celestial bodies, or on the astronomical patterns taken or included in an event at a time and place

 Astrology's claim to predict future trends and events is based on two main methods, in Western astrology: astrological transit and astrological transits
 Astrological transit is interpreted based on the motion of the planets because of space and horoscope
 Their speed is important when passing through

 sanshaivadiyon ke anusaar pashchimi jyotishiyon kaa ye tarika pramaan yogya anumaan lagane se bachaata he or unhen mahatvapurn se swecchit or asambandhit ghatnaon kaa abhipraay apane suvidhanusaar bataane kaa samarthy detaa he
 In the past, astrology often relied on close observation of celestial bodies and their movement

 The reasons are some common features

 vishuon ke purv nirnay ke kaaran, sadiyon baad, pashchimi jyotish ke baarah raashi chinhon kaa unke moulik nakshatron kii tarah akaash ke samaan bhaag se sambandh nahin rahaa

 Other differences between the two civilizations include the use of 27 nakshatras or lunar buildings that have been in use in India since the Vedic period and the system of planetary periods known as dasha

 Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces)
 The Western and Vedic zodiac signs have the same origin in the tradition of Kundalini astrology, so the two are similar to each other in many ways
