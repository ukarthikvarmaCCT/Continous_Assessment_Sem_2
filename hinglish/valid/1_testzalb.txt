 The following words can be used to describe a cancer
 cancer ke 100 se adhik prakaar hai
 The type of cancer is usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancer begins, but they are also known as the type of cells from which they are made
 
 Bladder cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer leukemia cancer cancer karkat ko koshika ke prakaar ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he jo gaanth se samanta rakhti he, isiilie, utak ko gaanth se utpann mana ja saktaa he
 These are tissue science and place respectively

 For example, liver cancer is called hepatocarcinoma; Cancer of fat cells is called liposarcoma
 aam canceron ke liye, ang ke angreji naam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma of the breast or memory ductal carcinoma
 yahan par visheshan dakatal kaa upyog sookshmdarshi main dikhaayi dene vaale us karkat ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he, jo saamaanya stan kii vahiniyon se samanta rakhti hai
 The term duct has been used to refer to the cancer of the breast vessels seen in a microscope

 For example, a benign knot of the smooth muscle of the uterus is called a leiomyoma
 
durbhaagya se, kuch tarah ke canceron ke liye bhi -oma pratyay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jaise melanoma or seminoma
 Broadly, the symptoms of cancer can be divided into three groups: yadhyapi viksit ho chuke karkat main dard ho saktaa he, aksar yah praarambhik lakshan nahin hota he
 Each of the symptoms in the above list can be caused by a variety of conditions
 Cuttack can be a common or unusual cause for each item

 Anything that replicates may possibly suffer from errors
 If error correction and prevention is not done properly, errors will persist and can also be transferred to daughter cells
 aam taur par, sharir kai vidhiyon ke madhyam se karkat ke khilaaf bachane kii koshish karata he, jaise: apoptosis, sahaayak anu, sambhavtah jeernata aadi
 However these error correction methods often fail in small ways, especially in environments where errors are more likely to occur and increase
 udhaaharan ke liye, aise vaataaran main vighatnkaaree tatv shaamil ho sakate hai jo carcinogen kehalaate hai
 Or periodic injury, or environments in which cells have not developed for their survival, such as hypoxia
 is prakaar se karkat ek pragatisheel rog he or ye pragatisheel trutiyaan dhire dhire koshika main sanchit hoti rahati hai jab tak jantu main upasthit koshika apane kaaryon ke vipareet kaary nahin karne lagati
 Errors that cause constriction are often self-amplifying, eventually increasing at an exponential rate
 udhaaharan ke liye: Thus, the sputum often explodes as a chain reaction due to some errors, these errors combined make more serious errors
 aisi trutiyaan jo adhik trutiyaan utpann karti hai, ve prabhavi rup se karkat kaa mul kaaran hai or saath hi, ye is baat kaa kaaran bhi hai ki karkat kaa upachaar bahut mushkil he: chaahe karkat kii 10,000,000,000 koshikaon main se sab ko maar dene ke baad, unamem se keval 10 koshikaayen apni pratikruti kar sakati hai yaa truti utpann karne vaale sanketon ko anya koshikaon ko bhej sakati hai to prakriya phir se shuru ho jaati he
 This rebellion-like scenario is the survival of the undesirable, where evolutionary forces themselves work against the design and system of the body

 Research about the causes of cancer often falls into the following categories: karkat rog janan kaa kaaran he DNA utparivartan jo koshika vruddhi or metastasis ko prabhavit karata he
 The substances that cause DNA mutation are called mutagens and those mutations that cause cancer are called carcinogens
 kai vishesh prakaar ke padaarth vishisht prakaar ke vikshepse jude hue hai
 Tobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer, and is the cause of 90% of lung cancers
 lambe samay tak esbestus fibre ke sampark main rahane se mizothelioma ho saktaa he
 Many mutagens are also carcinogens, but some carcinogens are not mutagens
 alcohol ek rasinic carcinogen kaa udhaaharan he jo utparivartajan nahin he
 Such chemicals promote cancer by stimulating the rate of cell division
 pratikruti kii tej dar anzimon kii marammat ke liye kam samay detii he jisase DNA pratikruti ke dauraan kshatigrast DNA kii marammat ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mil pataa he, jiske kaaran ek utparivartan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he

 Non-ionizing frequency radiations emanating from mobile phones and other sources have also been considered to cause cancer, but there is little evidence of such a relationship
 phir bhi kuch visheshgy ehtiyaati siddhant ke aadhaar par lambe samay tak ansi chizon ke sampark main rahane se bachane kii salaah dete hai
 Some cancer can be caused by infection with the pathogen
 kai cancer ek virus ke sankraman ke kaaran hote hai; yah vishesh rup se jantuon jaise pakshiyon main dekha jaataa he, lekin manushyon main bhi aisa hota he, puri duniya main 15% maanav cancer ke liye virus hi jimmedaar hai

47% of hepatitis b patients annually and 1
4% of hepatitis c patients per year
 liver serosis, chaahe chronic viral hepatitis sankraman ke kaaran ho yaa sharaab pine ke kaaran, yah yakrut cancer ke vikaas se sambandhit hota he or serosis or viral hepatitis kaa sangyojan yakrut cancer vikaas ke ucchtam jokhim kaa kaaran he
 Due to the transmission of viral hepatitis worldwide and the heavy burden of disease, liver cancer is one of the most common and most fatal cancers

 Famous examples are: garbhadhaaran ke saath or keval ek seemaant rup main kuch ang daataaon ke saath is rog kaa sancharan kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he, anyathaa cancer samanyatya ek sankramak rog nahin he
 The main reason for this is tissue tissue graft rejection due to major tissue homology complex incompatibility or incompatibility
 In humans and other vertebrates, the immune system uses MHC antigens to differentiate between "self" and "non-self" cells, as these antigens are different in each individual
 jab gaiyr swa pratijanon kaa saamana hota he, to pratiraksha tantra upyukt koshika ke khilaaf pratikriya karata he

 In general, oncogenes are silent, for example due to DNA methylation
 is methilikaran main kshati onkosin kii vipathi abhivyakti ko prerit karti he, jo cancer rogajanan kaa kaaran he
 Known systems of over-genetic transformation include DNA methylation and methylation or acetylation of linked histone proteins at specific positions on the chromosomal DNA
 chikitsa ke varg jo HDAC sandamak or DNA mithail transfarej sandamak ke rup main jane jate hai, ve cancer koshika main adhi-anuvaanshik sanketan ko punah niyamit kar sakate hai
 Oncogenes promote cell growth in many ways
 kai hormone bana sakate hai, yah koshikaon ke bich ek rasinic sandeshvahak hota he jo samasutri vibhaajan ko prerit karata he, jiskaa prabhaav grahi utak yaa koshika ke sanket pargaman par nirbhar karata he
 In other words, when a hormone receptor is stimulated on a recipient cell, the signal is transported from the cell surface to the nucleus of the cell, affecting some changes in gene transcription regulation at the central level
 kuch onkosin khud sanket pargaman tantra kaa bhaag hote hai, yaa koshikaon or utakon main sanket grahi kaa ek bhaag hote hai, is prakaar se aise hormonon kii samvedansheeltaa ko niyantrit karte hai
 Oncogenes often produce mitosis, or engage in the transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which makes proteins and enzymes, these proteins and enzymes are responsible for the production of products and biochemicals with which cells interact and which Cells use
 aadya-onchogin main utparivartan, jo saamanyatya onchogin ke sthir samakaksh hai, unki abhivyakti or kriya ko sanshodhit kar sakate hai or utpaada protein kii kriya yaa maatra ko badhaate hai
 When this happens, proto-oncogenes become oncogenes and this infection disturbs the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, allowing uncontrolled cell growth
 chaahe sambhav bhi ho jaye to bhi jinom main se aadya-onkosin ko hataa kar cancer ki sambhaavna ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki ve jeev kii vruddhi, marammat or samasthaapan ke liye jatil hote hai
 This only happens when they mutate and the signs of growth become excessive
 cancer anusandhan main paribhaashit kiye jane vaale pehle onkoseenon main se ek he raas onkosin
aadya-onkosin ke raas parivaar main utparivartan bahut aam hai, ye sabhi maanav ganthon ke 20% se 30% main paae jate hai
 Ras was originally identified in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome, and researchers were surprised to find that it not only had this gene presence in the human genome, but was also linked to a catalytic control element that induced cancer in cell line culture

 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaala jin prachurodabhavan virdohi sanketon or proteinon ke liye anukoden karata he, jo samasutri vibhaajan or koshika vruddhi kaa shaman kar dete hai
 In general, knot suppressor genes are transcription factors that are activated by cellular stress or DNA damage
 aksar DNA kshati ke kaaran mukt-utplavi anuvanshik padaarth kii upasthiti or saath hi anya lakshan dekhe ja sakate hai, jo aise anzimon or maarg ko prerit karte hai jo gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke sakriyan ke liye uttaradaayi he
 The function of such genes is to control the progression of the cell cycle for DNA repair, which prevents the mutation from being transferred to the daughter cell
 p53 protein, jo sabase zyada adhyayan kiye gaye gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon main se ek he, ek pratilekhan kaarak he jo hypoxia or parabangnee vikiran kshati sahit kai koshikeey tanavkaariyon ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 The knotting function of its knot has not been well understood, except for about half of all cancers involved in the p53 conversion
 spasht rup se p53 ke do kaary hai: ek pratilekhan kaarak ke rup main ek nabhikeey bhoomika or doosraa koshika chakra, koshika vibhaajan or apopatosis viniman main koshika dravyi bhoomika
 According to the Warburg hypothesis, glycolysis is the preferred use of energy for the growth of cancer
 p53 shwasan se glycolitic path ko sthanantaran kaa niyaman karata he
 However, a mutation can itself damage the knotting gene by "closing it" or the signaling pathway that activates it, the invariable consequence of which DNA repair is disrupted or inhibited
 : Accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage definitely causes cancer
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon ke utparivartan jo janan str koshikaon main utpann hote hai, ve santati main sthanantarit ho jate hai or agali pidhiyon main cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaa dete hai
 Members of these families have increased such incidence and this has decreased the latency of multiple tumors
 gaanth ke prakaar gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale utparivartan ke prayek prakaar ke liye praroopik hote hai, kuch utparivartan vishesh prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai, jabaki anya utparivartan anya prakaar ke cancer kaa kaaran hai
 The type of inheritance of a mutant tumor sedative is that an effective member inherits a defective copy from one parent and the normal copy from another parent
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vyakti jo ek utparivarti p53 elil ko vanshaagat rup se praapt karata he vah melanoma or agnashyi cancer viksit kar saktaa he jo lee-frameni syndrome kehalaata he
 Other hereditary knot suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations related to retino blastoma and APC gene mutations associated with adenopolyposis large intestine cancer
 Adenopolyposis large intestine cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in the large intestine in childhood, which is relatively Produce cancer of the large intestine at an early age
 ant main, BRCA1 or BRCA2 main vanshaagat utparivartan stan cancer kii praarambhik shuruyaat kaa kaaran banate hai
 In 1971, it was proposed that the development of cancer depends on at least two mutation events
 nudsan kii do chot kii pariklpana ke anusaar ek gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin main ek vanshaagat janan str utparivartan cancer ko keval tabhi utpann karegaa jab jeev ke jivan main baad main koi anya utparivartan ghatit hota he, yah us gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ke anya elil ko niskriy kar degaa
 Typically, oncogenes are effective, as they involve the action-of-gain mutation, while mutated tumor sedatives are ineffective, as they involve the action-of-loss mutation
 har koshika main samaan jin kii do pratilipiyaan hoti hai, inamen se prayek pratilipi abhibhavak se praapt kii jaati he or adhikansh maamalon ke antargat ek vishesh proto-onkosin kii keval ek pratilipi main kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan, us jin ko ek vaastavik onkosin banane ke liye paryaapt hota he
 On the other hand, the function-of-loss mutation needs to occur in both copies of the knot suppressor gene to make the gene completely dysfunctional
 haalanki, aise maamle hai jinamein gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii ek utparivartit pratilipi anya junglee-prakaar pratilipi ko kriyaaheen bana detii he
 This phenomenon is called dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations
 nudsan ke do chot ke modal ko haal hi main kai jaanchakartaaon dwaara chunauti di gai he
 Deactivation of one allele of some genes that suppress the knot is sufficient to produce a tumor
 yah ghatana agunit aparyaaptta kehalaati he or ise kai prayogtmak drushtikonon ke dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya he
 The onset of a knot resulting from haploid insufficiency is usually late, when it is compared to a two-injury process
 aksar, bahul anuvanshik parivartan jinka parinaam cancer hota he, unhen sanchit hone main kai saal lag sakate hai
 During this time, the biological behavior of pre-malignancy cells gradually changes from normal cell to cancer cell
 sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se purv durdam utak main vibhedak gun dekhe ja sakate hai
 Differential features include increased number of dividing cells, variation in nucleus size and shape, differentiation in cell size and shape, decrease in the properties of specialized cells and loss of normal tissue organization
 Dyspepsia is an unusual type of extra-cell proliferative building that is reflected by normal tissue system and loss of cell structure in pre-malignant cells
 ye praarambhik arbudeey parivartan ativardhan se vibhedit kiye jane chahiyein, jo ek bahari uddipan ke kaaran koshika vibhaajan main ek utparivarti vruddhi he, jaise hormoni asantulan yaa puraani jalan
 The most severe cases of malignancy are called "in situ carcinoma"
 latin main, "swasthani " shabd kaa arth he "sthaan main", isliye carcinoma swasthani shabd kaa arth he koshikaon kii aniyantrit vruddhi jo apane mul sthaan par hi bani rahati he or jisane anya utakon par koi akraman nahin darshaya he
 Nevertheless, carcinoma in situ can develop into an aggressive malignancy and is usually removed by surgery if possible
 jis tarah se jaanwaron kii aabaadi main vikaas hota he, thik usee tarah koshikaon kii aniyantrit aabaadi main bhi vikaas hota he
 This undesirable process is called somatic development and in this way cancer arises and becomes more painful
 koshikeey upaapachay main adhikansh parivartan jo koshika main aniyamit tareeke se vibhaajan kaa kaaran hai, ve koshika mrityu kaa kaaran hote hai
 However once the cancer starts, the cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: some cells with new genetic changes that multiply continuously to promote their life and reproduction and develop quickly
 The knot becomes dominant, as cells with less adapted genetic changes are out of competition
 isi prakaar se MRSA jaise rogajanak pratijaivik-pratirodhi ban jate hai or yahi kaaran he ki fasalon ke blit or keet kitnashak pratirodhi ban jate hai
 Due to this development, cancer recurrence consists of cells that acquire resistance to cancer drugs
