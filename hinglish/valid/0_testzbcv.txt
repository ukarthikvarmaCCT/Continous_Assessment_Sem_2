 The Green Revolution started in India from 1966-67
 harith kranti prarambh karne kaa shrey nobel puraskaar vijeta professor naraman borlog ko jaataa hai
 Green revolution is intended to increase crop production in irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural areas of the country by using high yielding hybrids and dwarf seeds
 harith kranti bhartiya krishi main lagu kii gai us vikaas vidhi kaa parinaam he, jo 1960 ke dashak main parmparik krishi ko aadhunik takniki dwaara pratisthapit kiye jane ke rup main saamne ai
 Because this technology came suddenly in the agricultural sector, it developed rapidly and in a short time it produced so many amazing results that the planners, agricultural experts and politicians of the country called this unexpected progress as 'green Revolution'

 The achievements of the Green Revolution can be seen as technical and institutional changes in agriculture and improvement in production as follows - Technological and institutional improvements in agriculture Use of chemical fertilizers naveen krishi niti ke parinamswaroop rasinic urvarkon ke upbhog kii maatra main teji se vruddhi hui he
 The use of chemical fertilizers was two kilograms per hectare in 1960–1961, which has increased to 128
6 kg per hectare in 2008–2009
 isi prakaar, 1960-1961 main desh main rasinic khaadon kii kul khapat 2
92 lakh ton thi, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 249

 Increase in use of improved seeds desh main adhik upaj dene vaale unnatsheel bijon kaa prayog badha he tathaa bijon kii nai nai kismon kii khoj kii gai he
 So far, the high yielding program has been implemented on crops like wheat, paddy, millet, maize and sorghum, but wheat has been the most successful
 varsh 2008-2009 main 1,00,000 quintal prajnak beej tathaa 9
69 lakh quintal aadhaar bijon kaa utpaadan hua tathaa 190 lakh pramanit beej vitarit kiye gayi
 Development of irrigation facilities nai vikaas vidhi ke antargat desh main sinchai suvidhaon kaa teji ke saath vistaar kiya gaya he
 The total irrigation potential in the country was 223 lakh hectares in 1951, which increased to 1,073 lakh hectares in 2008-2009
 desh main varsh 1951 main kul sanchit kshetra 210 lakh hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 673 lakh hectares ho gaya
 Plant protection naveen krishi vikaas vidhi ke antargat paudh sangrakshan par bhi dhyaan diya ja rahaa he

 In other words, achieving maximum output from a unit area of land without destroying the fertility power of the land is called multi-crop program
 1966-1967 main 36 lakh hectares bhoomi main bahufasali kaarykram lagu kiya gaya
 At present, this program is applicable on 71 percent of the total accumulated land of India
 aadhunik krishi yantron kaa prayog Modern agricultural equipment, such as tractors, threshers, harvesters, bulldozers and diesel and electric pumpsets, have contributed significantly to the new agricultural development method and green revolution
 is prakaar krishi main pashuon tathaa maanav shakti kaa pratisthaapan sanchaalan shakti dwaara kiya gaya he, jisase krishi kshetra ke upyog evam utpaadakta main vruddhi hui he
 Establishment of Agricultural Service Centers krishakon main vyavsaayik saahas kii kshamta ko viksit karne ke uddeshy se desh main krishi seva kendra sthapit karne kii yojana lagu kii gai he
 Under this scheme, people are first given technical training, then they are asked to set up service centers
 iske liye unhen rashtriyakrut bainkon se sahaayta dilaai jaati he

 For this, the corporation distributes tractors, pumpsets and other machinery on the basis of fare purchase method
 vibhinn nigamon kii sthapana The progress of Green Revolution mainly depends on the high yielding varieties and the improved seeds
 iske liye desh main 400 krishi farm sthapit kiye gayi hai
 The National Seeds Corporation has been established in 1963
 1963 main rashtriya sahakaari vikaas nigam kii sthapana kii gai, jiskaa mukhya uddeshy krishi upaj kaa vipanan, prasanskaran evam bhandaran karnaa he
 National Seed Project was also started with the help of World Bank, under which many seed corporations have been formed

 bhoomi sangrakshan Under the Land Conservation Program, arable land is made arable by preventing erosion and leveling the rugged land
 yah kaarykram uttar pradesh, rajasthan, gujarat tathaa madhya pradesh main teji se lagu he
 Agricultural Education and Research sarkaar kii krishi niti ke antargat krishi shiksha kaa vistaar karne ke liye pantnagar main pehla krishi vishvavidhyalay sthapit kiya gaya he
 Today, there are 4 agricultural universities, 39 state agricultural universities and one central university in Imphal for higher education in agriculture and allied fields
 krishi anusandhan hetu 'bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad' he, jiske antargat 53 kendriya santhaan, 32 rashtriya anusandhan kendra, 12 pariyojna nidashal 64 akhil bhartiya samanvay anusandhan pariyojnayen he
 Apart from this, there are 527 agricultural science centers in the country, which are doing the work of teaching and training
 krishi shiksha evam prashikshan kii gunvattta banaaye rakhane ke liye vibhinn sansthaaon ke computarikaran or internet kii suvidha pradaan kii gai he
 Improvement in agricultural production, increase in production and productivity harith kranti athwa bhartiya krishi main lagu kii gai nai vikaas vidhi kaa sabase bada laabh yah hua ki desh main fasalon ke kshetrafal main vruddhi, krishi utpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi ho gai
 There was an unprecedented increase in production of wheat, millet, paddy, maize and sorghum in particular
 jiske parinaam swaroop khadyannon main bharat aatmanirbhar-sa ho gaya
 The total production of food grains in the country in 1951-1952 was 5
09 million tonnes, which increased to 238 million tonnes respectively in 2008-2009
 isi tarah prati hectares utpaadakta main bhi paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 Production of food grains was 522 kg / ha in 1950–1951, which increased to 1,893 kg / ha in 2008–2009
 haan, bharat main khadyann utpaadanon main kuch ucchavachan bhi hua he, jo bure mausam aadi ke kaaran rahaa jo yah siddh karata he ki desh main krishi utpaadan abhi bhi mausam par nirbhar karata he
 Changes in the traditional form of agriculture harith kranti ke falswaroop kheti ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan hua he or kheti vyavsaayik drushti se kii jane lagi he
 Whereas earlier it was used only to fill the stomach
 desh main ganna, kapaas, patson tathaa tilhanon ke utpaadan main vruddhi hui he
 Cotton production was 5
6 million bales in 1960–1961, which increased to 27 million bales in 2008–2009
 isi tarah tilhanon kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 7 million ton tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 28
2 million ton ho gaya
 Similarly, production of commercial crops like jute, sugarcane, potato and groundnut has also increased
 vartmaan samay main desh main baagbani fasalon, falon, subjiyon tathaa phulon kii kheti ko bhi badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 Increase in agricultural savings unnatsheel bijon, rasinic khaadon, uttam sinchai tathaa mashiinon ke prayog se utpaadan badha he
 Due to which farmers have increased significantly in the amount of savings
 jisko desh ke vikaas ke kaam main laayaa ja sakaa he
 Strengthening forward and backward relationships naveen praudyogiki tathaa krishi ke aadhunikaran ne krishi tathaa udyog ke paraspar sambandh ko or bhi majboot bana diya he
 Traditionally, though the forward link between agriculture and industry was already strong, because many inputs are made available to industries by the agricultural sector
 parantu in donon main pratigaami sambandh bahut hi kamazor tha, kyonki udyog nirmit vastuon kaa krishi main bahut hi kam upyog hota tha
 But as a result of modernization of agriculture, there has been a huge increase in the demand for industrial manufactured inputs in agriculture, such as agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, etc
, due to which the retrograde relationship of agriculture has also been strengthened
 anya shabdon main krishi evam audyogic kshetra ke sambandhon main adhik majbootee ai he
 It is thus clear that there has been a substantial improvement in agricultural inputs and production in the country as a result of the Green Revolution
 iske falswaroop krishak, sarkaar tathaa janata sabhi main yah vishwaas jaagrath ho gaya he ki bharat krishi padaarthon ke utpaadan ke kshetra main aatmanirbhar hi nahin ho saktaa, balki niryaat bhi kar saktaa he
 Analysis desh main yojana kaal main krishi ke kshetra main paryaapt vikaas hua he
 The total agricultural area has increased, the nature of the crop has changed, the irrigated area has increased, the use of chemical fertilizers has increased and modern agricultural machines have started being used
 in sab baton ke hote huye bhi abhi tak desh main krishi kaa vikaas uchit str tak nahin pahunch paaya he, kyonki yahan prati hectares krishi utpaadan anya viksit deshon kii tulana main kam he
 It now studies importing many agricultural products
 kyonki unka utpaadan maang kii tulana main kam he
 a large part of the agricultural sector is still unirrigated
 krishi main yantrikaran kaa str abhi bhi kam he, jisase utpaadan laagat adhik aati he
 Farmers do not get sufficient departmental facilities, which hinders agricultural development
 atah is baat kii aavashyaktaa he ki krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudhaaron ko adhik kargar dhang se lagu kar krishi kshetra kaa or adhik vikaas kiya jaye
 Expansion of green revolution kendriya bajet 2010-2011 main krishi kshetra ke vikaas ke liye banaai gayi kaary yojana ke pehle ghatak main gram sabhaaon tathaa kisaan pariwaron ke sakriy sahyog se desh ke purvi kshetra bihar, chhattisgarh, purvi uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal tathaa urisa main harith kranti ke vistaar ke liye 400 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Drawbacks and problems desh main harith kranti ke falswaroop kuch fasalon ke utpaadan main paryaapt vruddhi hui he, khadyanno ke aayaat main kami ai he, krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan aayaa he, phir bhi is kaarykram main kuch kamiyaan parilakshith hoti hai
 The major shortcomings and problems of the Green Revolution can be presented as follows: prabhaav - harith kranti kaa prabhaav kuch vishesh fasalon tak hi simit rahaa, jaise- gehun, jowar, bajra
 There has been no impact on other crops
 yahan tak ki chaaval bhi isse bahut hi kam prabhavit hua he
 Business crops are also unaffected by this
 poonjivadi krishi ko badhaava - adhik upjau kism ke beej ek puunji-gahan kaarykram hai, jisamen urvarkon, sinchai, krishi yantron aadi aagton par baari maatra main nivesh karnaa padataa he
 Investing heavily is beyond the capacity of small and medium-sized farmers
 is tarah, harith kranti se laabh unheen kisaanon ko ho rahaa he, jinke paas nijee pumping set, tractor, nalakup tathaa anya krishi yantra hai
 This facility is available only to big farmers of the country
 saamaanya kisaan in suvidhaon se vanchit hai
 The need for institutional reforms is not emphasized - the need for institutional reforms has been completely ignored in the new development method
 sansthagat parivartano ke antargat sabase mahatvapurn ghatak bhu-dhaaran kii vyavastha he
 It is only with this technology that maximum output can be achieved by technological changes
 desh main bhoomi sudhaar kaarykram safal nahin rahe hai tathaa lakhon krishakon ko aaj bhi bhu-dhaaran kii nischitata nahin pradaan kii ja saki he
 The problem of labor displacement - Due to agricultural mechanization used under the Green Revolution, labor displacement has got a boost
 gramin jansankhya kaa rojgaar kii talash main shaharon kii ore palaayan karne kaa yah bhi ek kaaran he
 Increasing income inequality - Technological changes in agriculture have the opposite effect on income distribution in rural areas

 Regional imbalance - The impact of Green Revolution is limited to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu
 iskaa prabhaav sampoorn desh par naa fail paane ke kaaran desh kaa santulit rup se vikaas nahin ho paaya
 In this way, the Green Revolution has been a limited success
 harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye suzav Promoting Institutional Changes - Land reform programs must be implemented effectively and comprehensively for the success of the Green Revolution
 bataaidaron ko swaamitv kaa adhikaar dilaayaa janaa chahie
 The excess land obtained from the demarcation should be distributed among the landless cultivators
 chakbandi kaa prabhavi banaakar joton ke vibhaajan par prabhavi roak lagaayi jaani chahie
 Facility of agricultural finance - While increasing the facilities of agricultural finance, small farmers should be provided with a credit facility at concessional rate so that they can purchase necessary advanced seeds, chemical fertilizers and agricultural implements
 rojgaar ke avasaron main vruddhi - shram pradhan takneekon ko apanaaya janaa chahie tathaa gramin kshetron main bekaari kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye kutir evam gram udyogon kaa teji se vistaar kiya janaa chahie
 Development of means of irrigation - Adequate development of irrigation facilities should be done in the country, so that farmers can take full advantage of high yielding varieties
 is sandarbh main laghu sinchai pariyojnaon ke vistaar par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 Expansion of other structural reforms - Other structural facilities, including electricity, transport, necessary for the development of agriculture should be developed
 tabhi harith kranti anya fasalon tathaa kshetron tak fail sakegi
 Spread of Green Revolution to other crops - For the success of Green Revolution, it is necessary that it should be extended to the cultivation of rice and other crops
 chaaval ke saath daalen, kapaas, ganna, tilhan, jute aadi vyapaarik fasalon ke sambandh main bhi utpaadan vruddhi santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 Therefore, these crops should also be included in the area of green revolution
 chote khet or chote kisaanon ko sambaddh karnaa - chote kheton tathaa chote kisaanon ko bhi harith kranti se sambaddh karnaa chahie
 For this, it is necessary that land reform programs should be implemented quickly and effectively, small farmers should be provided credit facilities at moderate terms and rates for purchasing essential seeds, fertilizers etc
, simple agriculture
 In addition to the facilities given in connection with the purchase of equipment, hire large farm machinery such as tractors, harvesters etc
 on behalf of the government
 Should be taken, farmers with very small holdings should be motivated to adopt cooperative farming
 samanvit farm niti - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye samanvit farm niti apanaayi jaani chahie, taaki farm takniki va aagton ke mulyon ke sambandh main ek uchit niti apanaai ja sake tathaa krishakon ko unntshil beej, khaad, kitnashak tathaa krishi yantra evam upkaran uchit mulya par samay par uplabdh ho saken
 Apart from this, the government should make arrangements for the sale of all agricultural produce and should also guarantee to buy agricultural products at a reasonable price

 is niti main sarkaar ne 2020 tak krishi ke kshetra main prativarsh 4 pratishat vruddhi kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 The new agricultural policy has been described as 'indradhanush Revolution', in which all the revolutions are directly or indirectly in the agricultural sector of the country, like 'green Revolution', 'white Revolution', 'yellow Revolution', 'blue Revolution' ',' Red Revolution ',' Golden Revolution ',' Brown Revolution ',' Brown Revolution ',' Silver Revolution 'and' Food Chain Revolution 'will have to be taken together, this is called the' Rainbow Revolution ' Security has

 An exception is a situation where a new result is found in place of a general assumption or estimate
 Such a situation is considered an exception

 Example 1- If people of Hindu religion go to the temple then it is normal, but if a person of other religion goes to the temple then it will be an exception because it is beyond expectations
 udhaaharan 2 - kisi sundar mahila ke dwaara uksaane par bhi yadi koi purush uski or aakarshith nahi hota to vah purush sabhi purushon main apwaad hoga
 The exception is therefore a breaking of normal expectations and dispositions

 The Green Revolution started in India from 1966-67
 harith kranti prarambh karne kaa shrey nobel puraskaar vijeta professor naraman borlog ko jaataa hai
 Green revolution is intended to increase crop production in irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural areas of the country by using high yielding hybrids and dwarf seeds
 harith kranti bhartiya krishi main lagu kii gai us vikaas vidhi kaa parinaam he, jo 1960 ke dashak main parmparik krishi ko aadhunik takniki dwaara pratisthapit kiye jane ke rup main saamne ai
 Because this technology came suddenly in the agricultural sector, it developed rapidly and in a short time it produced so many amazing results that the planners, agricultural experts and politicians of the country called this unexpected progress as 'green Revolution'
 harith kranti kii sangya isaliye bhi di gai, kyonki iske falswaroop bhartiya krishi nirvaah str se upar uthakar aadhiky str par aa chuki thi
 Achievements harith kranti ke falswaroop desh ke krishi kshetra main mahatvapurn pragati hui
 Agricultural production in the country has increased as a result of qualitative improvement in agricultural inputs
 khadyannon main aatmanirbharta ai he
 Commercial agriculture has received a boost

 Agricultural surpluses have increased
 harith kranti ke falswaroop gehun, ganna, makka tathaa bajra aadi fasalon ke prati hectares utpaadan evam kul utpaadakta main kaafii vruddhi hui he
 The achievements of the Green Revolution can be seen as technical and institutional changes in agriculture and improvement in production as follows - Technological and institutional improvements in agriculture Use of chemical fertilizers naveen krishi niti ke parinamswaroop rasinic urvarkon ke upbhog kii maatra main teji se vruddhi hui he
 The use of chemical fertilizers was two kilograms per hectare in 1960–1961, which has increased to 128
6 kg per hectare in 2008–2009
 isi prakaar, 1960-1961 main desh main rasinic khaadon kii kul khapat 2
92 lakh ton thi, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 249
09 lakh ton ho gai
 Increase in use of improved seeds desh main adhik upaj dene vaale unnatsheel bijon kaa prayog badha he tathaa bijon kii nai nai kismon kii khoj kii gai he
 So far, the high yielding program has been implemented on crops like wheat, paddy, millet, maize and sorghum, but wheat has been the most successful
 varsh 2008-2009 main 1,00,000 quintal prajnak beej tathaa 9
69 lakh quintal aadhaar bijon kaa utpaadan hua tathaa 190 lakh pramanit beej vitarit kiye gayi
 Development of irrigation facilities nai vikaas vidhi ke antargat desh main sinchai suvidhaon kaa teji ke saath vistaar kiya gaya he
 The total irrigation potential in the country was 223 lakh hectares in 1951, which increased to 1,073 lakh hectares in 2008-2009
 desh main varsh 1951 main kul sanchit kshetra 210 lakh hectares tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 673 lakh hectares ho gaya
 Plant protection naveen krishi vikaas vidhi ke antargat paudh sangrakshan par bhi dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Under this, sprinkling of medicine is done to destroy the weeds and pests and to control the locust team
 vartmaan main samekit krishi prabandh ke antargat paristhitiki anukool krimi niyantran kaarykram lagu kiya gaya he
 Multiple program bahufasali kaarykram kaa uddeshy ek hi bhoomi par varsh main ek se adhik fasal ugaakar utpaadan ko badhanaa he
 In other words, achieving maximum output from a unit area of land without destroying the fertility power of the land is called multi-crop program
 1966-1967 main 36 lakh hectares bhoomi main bahufasali kaarykram lagu kiya gaya
 At present, this program is applicable on 71 percent of the total accumulated land of India
 aadhunik krishi yantron kaa prayog Modern agricultural equipment, such as tractors, threshers, harvesters, bulldozers and diesel and electric pumpsets, have contributed significantly to the new agricultural development method and green revolution
 is prakaar krishi main pashuon tathaa maanav shakti kaa pratisthaapan sanchaalan shakti dwaara kiya gaya he, jisase krishi kshetra ke upyog evam utpaadakta main vruddhi hui he
 Establishment of Agricultural Service Centers krishakon main vyavsaayik saahas kii kshamta ko viksit karne ke uddeshy se desh main krishi seva kendra sthapit karne kii yojana lagu kii gai he
 Under this scheme, people are first given technical training, then they are asked to set up service centers
 iske liye unhen rashtriyakrut bainkon se sahaayta dilaai jaati he
 a total of 1,314 agricultural service centers have been established in the country so far
 krishi udyog nigam Agricultural industry corporations have been set up in 17 states under the government policy
 in nigamon kaa kaary krishi upkarnon va mashinari kii purti tathaa upaj prasanskaran evam bhandaran ko protsaahan dena he
 For this, the corporation distributes tractors, pumpsets and other machinery on the basis of fare purchase method
 vibhinn nigamon kii sthapana The progress of Green Revolution mainly depends on the high yielding varieties and the improved seeds
 iske liye desh main 400 krishi farm sthapit kiye gayi hai
 The National Seeds Corporation has been established in 1963
 1963 main rashtriya sahakaari vikaas nigam kii sthapana kii gai, jiskaa mukhya uddeshy krishi upaj kaa vipanan, prasanskaran evam bhandaran karnaa he
 National Seed Project was also started with the help of World Bank, under which many seed corporations have been formed
 bhartiya rashtriya krishi sahakaarita vipanan sangh ek sheersh vipanan sanghathan he, jo prabandhan, vipanan evam krishi sambandhit chuninda vastuon ke aayaat niryaat kaa kaary karata he
 In addition, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development has been established for the purpose of agricultural finance
 krishi ke liye khaadya nigam evam urvarak saakh garanti nigam, gramin vidyutikaran nigam aadi bhi sthapit kiye gaye hai
 Soil testing mrudaa pareekshan kaarykram ke antargat vibhinn kshetron kii mitti kaa pareekshan sarkari prayogshaalaon main kiya jaataa he
 Its purpose is to find out the fertility of the land and to advise farmers to use chemical fertilizers and good seeds
 vartmaan samay main in sarkari prayoshaalaon main prativarsh saat lakh namoonon kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 Some moving laboratories have also been set up, which go from village to village and advise the farmers by testing the soil on the spot
 bhoomi sangrakshan Under the Land Conservation Program, arable land is made arable by preventing erosion and leveling the rugged land
 yah kaarykram uttar pradesh, rajasthan, gujarat tathaa madhya pradesh main teji se lagu he
 Agricultural Education and Research sarkaar kii krishi niti ke antargat krishi shiksha kaa vistaar karne ke liye pantnagar main pehla krishi vishvavidhyalay sthapit kiya gaya he
 Today, there are 4 agricultural universities, 39 state agricultural universities and one central university in Imphal for higher education in agriculture and allied fields
 krishi anusandhan hetu 'bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad' he, jiske antargat 53 kendriya santhaan, 32 rashtriya anusandhan kendra, 12 pariyojna nidashal 64 akhil bhartiya samanvay anusandhan pariyojnayen he
 Apart from this, there are 527 agricultural science centers in the country, which are doing the work of teaching and training
 krishi shiksha evam prashikshan kii gunvattta banaaye rakhane ke liye vibhinn sansthaaon ke computarikaran or internet kii suvidha pradaan kii gai he
 Improvement in agricultural production, increase in production and productivity harith kranti athwa bhartiya krishi main lagu kii gai nai vikaas vidhi kaa sabase bada laabh yah hua ki desh main fasalon ke kshetrafal main vruddhi, krishi utpaadan tathaa utpaadakta main vruddhi ho gai
 There was an unprecedented increase in production of wheat, millet, paddy, maize and sorghum in particular
 jiske parinaam swaroop khadyannon main bharat aatmanirbhar-sa ho gaya
 The total production of food grains in the country in 1951-1952 was 5
09 million tonnes, which increased to 238 million tonnes respectively in 2008-2009
 isi tarah prati hectares utpaadakta main bhi paryaapt sudhaar hua he
 Production of food grains was 522 kg / ha in 1950–1951, which increased to 1,893 kg / ha in 2008–2009
 haan, bharat main khadyann utpaadanon main kuch ucchavachan bhi hua he, jo bure mausam aadi ke kaaran rahaa jo yah siddh karata he ki desh main krishi utpaadan abhi bhi mausam par nirbhar karata he
 Changes in the traditional form of agriculture harith kranti ke falswaroop kheti ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan hua he or kheti vyavsaayik drushti se kii jane lagi he
 Whereas earlier it was used only to fill the stomach
 desh main ganna, kapaas, patson tathaa tilhanon ke utpaadan main vruddhi hui he
 Cotton production was 5
6 million bales in 1960–1961, which increased to 27 million bales in 2008–2009
 isi tarah tilhanon kaa utpaadan 1960-1961 main 7 million ton tha, jo badhkar 2008-2009 main 28
2 million ton ho gaya
 Similarly, production of commercial crops like jute, sugarcane, potato and groundnut has also increased
 vartmaan samay main desh main baagbani fasalon, falon, subjiyon tathaa phulon kii kheti ko bhi badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 Increase in agricultural savings unnatsheel bijon, rasinic khaadon, uttam sinchai tathaa mashiinon ke prayog se utpaadan badha he
 Due to which farmers have increased significantly in the amount of savings
 jisko desh ke vikaas ke kaam main laayaa ja sakaa he
 Strengthening forward and backward relationships naveen praudyogiki tathaa krishi ke aadhunikaran ne krishi tathaa udyog ke paraspar sambandh ko or bhi majboot bana diya he
 Traditionally, though the forward link between agriculture and industry was already strong, because many inputs are made available to industries by the agricultural sector
 parantu in donon main pratigaami sambandh bahut hi kamazor tha, kyonki udyog nirmit vastuon kaa krishi main bahut hi kam upyog hota tha
 But as a result of modernization of agriculture, there has been a huge increase in the demand for industrial manufactured inputs in agriculture, such as agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, etc
, due to which the retrograde relationship of agriculture has also been strengthened
 anya shabdon main krishi evam audyogic kshetra ke sambandhon main adhik majbootee ai he
 It is thus clear that there has been a substantial improvement in agricultural inputs and production in the country as a result of the Green Revolution
 iske falswaroop krishak, sarkaar tathaa janata sabhi main yah vishwaas jaagrath ho gaya he ki bharat krishi padaarthon ke utpaadan ke kshetra main aatmanirbhar hi nahin ho saktaa, balki niryaat bhi kar saktaa he
 Analysis desh main yojana kaal main krishi ke kshetra main paryaapt vikaas hua he
 The total agricultural area has increased, the nature of the crop has changed, the irrigated area has increased, the use of chemical fertilizers has increased and modern agricultural machines have started being used
 in sab baton ke hote huye bhi abhi tak desh main krishi kaa vikaas uchit str tak nahin pahunch paaya he, kyonki yahan prati hectares krishi utpaadan anya viksit deshon kii tulana main kam he
 It now studies importing many agricultural products
 kyonki unka utpaadan maang kii tulana main kam he
 a large part of the agricultural sector is still unirrigated
 krishi main yantrikaran kaa str abhi bhi kam he, jisase utpaadan laagat adhik aati he
 Farmers do not get sufficient departmental facilities, which hinders agricultural development
 atah is baat kii aavashyaktaa he ki krishi main takniki evam sansthagat sudhaaron ko adhik kargar dhang se lagu kar krishi kshetra kaa or adhik vikaas kiya jaye
 Expansion of green revolution kendriya bajet 2010-2011 main krishi kshetra ke vikaas ke liye banaai gayi kaary yojana ke pehle ghatak main gram sabhaaon tathaa kisaan pariwaron ke sakriy sahyog se desh ke purvi kshetra bihar, chhattisgarh, purvi uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal tathaa urisa main harith kranti ke vistaar ke liye 400 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Drawbacks and problems desh main harith kranti ke falswaroop kuch fasalon ke utpaadan main paryaapt vruddhi hui he, khadyanno ke aayaat main kami ai he, krishi ke paramparaagat swaroop main parivartan aayaa he, phir bhi is kaarykram main kuch kamiyaan parilakshith hoti hai
 The major shortcomings and problems of the Green Revolution can be presented as follows: prabhaav - harith kranti kaa prabhaav kuch vishesh fasalon tak hi simit rahaa, jaise- gehun, jowar, bajra
 There has been no impact on other crops
 yahan tak ki chaaval bhi isse bahut hi kam prabhavit hua he
 Business crops are also unaffected by this
 poonjivadi krishi ko badhaava - adhik upjau kism ke beej ek puunji-gahan kaarykram hai, jisamen urvarkon, sinchai, krishi yantron aadi aagton par baari maatra main nivesh karnaa padataa he
 Investing heavily is beyond the capacity of small and medium-sized farmers
 is tarah, harith kranti se laabh unheen kisaanon ko ho rahaa he, jinke paas nijee pumping set, tractor, nalakup tathaa anya krishi yantra hai
 This facility is available only to big farmers of the country
 saamaanya kisaan in suvidhaon se vanchit hai
 The need for institutional reforms is not emphasized - the need for institutional reforms has been completely ignored in the new development method
 sansthagat parivartano ke antargat sabase mahatvapurn ghatak bhu-dhaaran kii vyavastha he
 It is only with this technology that maximum output can be achieved by technological changes
 desh main bhoomi sudhaar kaarykram safal nahin rahe hai tathaa lakhon krishakon ko aaj bhi bhu-dhaaran kii nischitata nahin pradaan kii ja saki he
 The problem of labor displacement - Due to agricultural mechanization used under the Green Revolution, labor displacement has got a boost
 gramin jansankhya kaa rojgaar kii talash main shaharon kii ore palaayan karne kaa yah bhi ek kaaran he
 Increasing income inequality - Technological changes in agriculture have the opposite effect on income distribution in rural areas

 raav ke anusaar, "yah baat ab sarvavidit he ki tathakthith harith kranti, jisane desh me khadyannon kaa utpaadan badhaane me sahaayta di he, ke saath gramin aay me asamanta badi he, bahut se chote kisaanon ko apane kaashtakaari adhikaar chhodane pade hai or gramin kshetron me saamaajik or aarthik tanaav bade hai
 " aavashyak suvidhaon kaa abhaav - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye aavashyak suvidhaon yatha- sinchai vyavastha, krishi saakh, aarthik jot tathaa saste aagton aadi ke abhaav main krishi-vikaas ke kshetra main vaanchit safalataa nahin praapt ho paa rahi he
 Regional imbalance - The impact of Green Revolution is limited to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu
 iskaa prabhaav sampoorn desh par naa fail paane ke kaaran desh kaa santulit rup se vikaas nahin ho paaya
 In this way, the Green Revolution has been a limited success
 harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye suzav Promoting Institutional Changes - Land reform programs must be implemented effectively and comprehensively for the success of the Green Revolution
 bataaidaron ko swaamitv kaa adhikaar dilaayaa janaa chahie
 The excess land obtained from the demarcation should be distributed among the landless cultivators
 chakbandi kaa prabhavi banaakar joton ke vibhaajan par prabhavi roak lagaayi jaani chahie
 Facility of agricultural finance - While increasing the facilities of agricultural finance, small farmers should be provided with a credit facility at concessional rate so that they can purchase necessary advanced seeds, chemical fertilizers and agricultural implements
 rojgaar ke avasaron main vruddhi - shram pradhan takneekon ko apanaaya janaa chahie tathaa gramin kshetron main bekaari kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye kutir evam gram udyogon kaa teji se vistaar kiya janaa chahie
 Development of means of irrigation - Adequate development of irrigation facilities should be done in the country, so that farmers can take full advantage of high yielding varieties
 is sandarbh main laghu sinchai pariyojnaon ke vistaar par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 Expansion of other structural reforms - Other structural facilities, including electricity, transport, necessary for the development of agriculture should be developed
 tabhi harith kranti anya fasalon tathaa kshetron tak fail sakegi
 Spread of Green Revolution to other crops - For the success of Green Revolution, it is necessary that it should be extended to the cultivation of rice and other crops
 chaaval ke saath daalen, kapaas, ganna, tilhan, jute aadi vyapaarik fasalon ke sambandh main bhi utpaadan vruddhi santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 Therefore, these crops should also be included in the area of green revolution
 chote khet or chote kisaanon ko sambaddh karnaa - chote kheton tathaa chote kisaanon ko bhi harith kranti se sambaddh karnaa chahie
 For this, it is necessary that land reform programs should be implemented quickly and effectively, small farmers should be provided credit facilities at moderate terms and rates for purchasing essential seeds, fertilizers etc
, simple agriculture
 In addition to the facilities given in connection with the purchase of equipment, hire large farm machinery such as tractors, harvesters etc
 on behalf of the government
 Should be taken, farmers with very small holdings should be motivated to adopt cooperative farming
 samanvit farm niti - harith kranti kii safalataa ke liye samanvit farm niti apanaayi jaani chahie, taaki farm takniki va aagton ke mulyon ke sambandh main ek uchit niti apanaai ja sake tathaa krishakon ko unntshil beej, khaad, kitnashak tathaa krishi yantra evam upkaran uchit mulya par samay par uplabdh ho saken
 Apart from this, the government should make arrangements for the sale of all agricultural produce and should also guarantee to buy agricultural products at a reasonable price
 nayi rashtriya krishi niti The Central Government announced the 'new National Agricultural Policy' on 28 July 2000
 is niti main sarkaar ne 2020 tak krishi ke kshetra main prativarsh 4 pratishat vruddhi kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 The new agricultural policy has been described as 'indradhanush Revolution', in which all the revolutions are directly or indirectly in the agricultural sector of the country, like 'green Revolution', 'white Revolution', 'yellow Revolution', 'blue Revolution' ',' Red Revolution ',' Golden Revolution ',' Brown Revolution ',' Brown Revolution ',' Silver Revolution 'and' Food Chain Revolution 'will have to be taken together, this is called the' Rainbow Revolution ' Security has
