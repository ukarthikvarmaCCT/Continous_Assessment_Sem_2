 He also researched hydrogen cyanide and carbon-mono-oxide and stated that they inhibit respiration
 unhone kii jeevarsayan kriyaaon ke liye sahaayak upaghatak nicotinomide or dihydroginej anzim aadi kaa bahut adhyayan kiya
 He also proved that there is a direct correlation between the ph and oxygen consumption of a cancer cell

 Brief Description by Dean Burke - This lecture was given by Otto Warburg at the 1966 annual session of the Nobel Prize winners in Lindau, Germany
 unhen 1931 main koshikeey-shwasan main oxigen-parivahan anzim kii khoj ke liye medisin main nobel puraskaar diya gaya tha or 1944 main bhi hydrogen-parivahan anzimes ke liye sakriy tatwon kii khoj ke liye bhi nobel puraskaar diya jane vaala tha, parantu aisa kaha jaataa he ki oto yahudee mul ke naagarik the isliye adolf hitler nahin chaahate the ki unhen nabell puraskaar diya jaye

 There are main and secondary or secondary causes of any disease
 udhaaharan ke taur par plig kaa mukhya kaaran plig kaa keetanu he, jabaki dwitiyak kaaran gandagi, chuuhe or pissu hai
 The main reason is that it is present in every patient suffering from that disease
 isi tarah cancer ke bhi anginat dwitiyak kaaran ho sakate hai
 But the main cause of cancer is the normal cellular respiration by oxygen being disrupted and converted to fermentation of sugars
 sharir kii sabhi koshikaayen oxigen dwaara shwasan karke urja praapt karti hai, jabaki cancer koshika sharkara ko khamir karke urja praapt karti he
 All normal cells are actually airborne and cancer cells are partial non-living organisms that carry on life by fermenting glucose like low-level unicellular organisms
 bhautik or rasayanashastra kii drushti se saamaanya or cancer koshika main yah antar mahatvapurn he
 Cancer research was being done at the Dehlem Institute right from the beginning
 yahan oxigen-parivahan anzim hydrogen-parivahan anzimes kii khoj hui or unki rasaynic sanrachana kaa baariki se adhyayan kiya gaya
 If it is true that the main cause of cancer is normal oxygenation by oxygen inhibiting and converting to fermentation, then without exception all cancer cells will respire by yeast and normal cells will never respire by yeast
 do america vaigyanikon melmagraine or flenegan ne saral prayog se yah siddh kiya tha
 They released spores of tetanus into the blood of mice, which sprout and break up in the absence of oxygen and give rise to germs that spread tetanus
 unhone paaya ki chuuhe swasth the or unamem titains rog ke koi lakshan dikhaai nahin de gahe the, kyonki unke sharir main kahin bhi aisa sthaan nahin tha jahaan paryaapt oxigen vidyaman nahin ho
 But when the spores of tetanus were released into the blood of cancer-infected mice, the mice became infected with tetanus disease, because the amount of oxygen inside the cancerous knots in their body was so low that the spores of the tetanus sprouted and the germs of the tetanus came out
 And the mice became infected with tetanus disease
 in prayogon se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki cancer koshikaaye aanshik avayujeevi or saamaanya koshikaaye vayujeevi hoti hai
 We try to understand a different kind of experiment here that shows quantitative relationships between cancer malignancy and cancer growth
 herold moris, neshnal cancer institute, bethesda ne apane prayogon main jab alag-alag sakriyata vaale liver cansarkaarak tatv jab chuhon ke rakt main chode to dekha ki chuhon main jo cancer kii ganthen hui unki vruddhi-dar bhi alag-alag thi
 It means to say that while the lumps of a rat doubled in three days, it took 30 days for the other mice to double
 neshnal cancer institute ke hi dean bark or mark woods 3 ne alag-alag hepetomaz main khamirikaran kii dar or hepetoma ke badhane kii dar ko ek graph dwaara pradarshit kiya
 They found that there is a direct quantitative correlation between yeast and growth rate
 unhone dekha ki jaise jaise hepetoma kii vruddhi-dar badhati he, khamirikaran bhi usee anupaat main yaa or teji se badhata he
 Dean Burke and Mark Woods have lowered the rate of fermentation in the zero-point region of their graphs that it is not possible to measure by conventional methods, while the minimum growth rate of the knot in the same region can be easily measured
 lekin jab unhone sharkara ke khamirikaran ko naapane ke zyada samvedansheel tareeke viksit kiye to siddh ho gaya ki bahut dhire-dhire badhane vaale cancer bhi sharkara ko khamir karte hai
 Now it has been proved that consuming sugar by fermenting sugar is a special feature of the cancer cell, so let us try to understand how a normal cell turns into a non-living organism ie it becomes a cancer cell
 
 iske liye ham dehlem institute ke gahen, gayasler or lorenj dwaara kiye gayi prayogon ko samajhane kaa ytn karte hai
 When the rat embryonic cells were kept in a suitable medium where oxygen levels were also sufficient, they continued to perform pneumatic respiration in the presence of oxygen, dividing, and fermentation
 lekin jab oxigen kaa str itnaa kam kar diya ki koshikaon kii viviya shwasan-kriya aanshik rup se baadhit hone lagi to 48 ghante main do koshikeey vibhaajan ke baad ve khamir karne vaali cancer-koshikaon main roopaantarit ho gai
 And she started breathing anaerobically
 phir hamane vibhajit ho rahi bhrun-koshikaon main oxigen kaa dabaav or khamirikaran ko naapane kaa yantra viksit kiya, jo sanlagn chitra main spasht dikhaaya gaya he
 In this system, we saw that the cells got transformed into cancer cells after reducing the pneumatic respiration by 35 percent
 yadi sharir main oxigen kaa dabaav itnaa kam ho jaye ki vibhajit ho rahi koshikaon kii viviya shwasan-kriya 35 pratishat baadhit ho jaye to cancer ho jaataa he
 This proved that when the pneumatic respiration in the body is partially obstructed, cancer cells start to form and begin to respire through fermentation
 hamaari prithvi ke vikaas ke praarambhik daur main vaataavaran oxigen rahit tha or jivan ke naam par sirf avibhedit ek-kosiya khamir dwaara shwasan karne vaale jeev hi vidyaman the
 Then billions of years later, when oxygen arrived in our atmosphere, these indistinguishable unicellular organisms began to differentiate, pneumatic respiration, and thus the growth of flora and fauna on Earth began
 lekin yah avibhedan ham aaj bhi cancer koshikaon main dekh rahe hai
 We also see that cancer often develops even when there is not enough oxygen in the atmosphere, because either the dividing cells are not getting enough oxygen or the cells do not have the active elements that catalyze respiratory-enzymes
 Huh
 lekin jo bhi sthiti ho cancer main hameshaa oxigen-shwasan baadhit hota he, khamirikaran hota he or koshikaayen avibhedit hone lagati hai
 Cancer cells have the ability to divide unnecessarily uncontrollably, and all the functions necessary for life are lost
 arthath jab shwasan baadhit hota he, cancer janm letaa he, tab jivan kaa astitv to rahata he, par vah vibhajit ho rahi dishaheen koshikaon ke samooh ke sivaa kuch nahin hota he
 Now the question is why does oxygen penetrate and why does lack of oxygen discriminate? Or why respiration pierces and fermentation discriminates
 jabaki shwasan-kriya or khamirikaran donon hi koshika vibhaajan karne main sakasham hai or yadi khamirikaran main bhedan kii kshamta bhi hoti to shaayad is prithvi par cancer kaa astitv hi nahin hota
 In this way, there are many questions whose explanation may possibly give biochemistry
 shwasan-kriya or khamirikaran donon main hi phosphate urja prayukt hoti he lekin donon main phosforilation kaa tarika alag-alag hota he
 In the context of cancer, pneumatic phosphorylation is capable of penetrating, but yeast phosphorylation does not have this capability
 shwasan or khamirikaran ke chayapachay-path se spasht he ki piruvik acid banane tak donon ke chayapachay-path main koi fark nahin he
 But after this, the action path of both of them is different
 khamirikaran main piruvik acid ek hi rasaynic kriya main diahydro-nicotinomide dwaara apaghatit hokar lactic-acid banataa he
 Whereas in pneumatic respiration, pyruvic acid undergoes many complex chemical reactions in the presence of oxygen to form water and carbon dioxide
 mukhya bindu • It is easier to inhibit respiration than fermentation because respiration is a more complex process
 • shwasan-kriya baadhit hone par koshikaaye badi saralata se khamirikaran karne lagati hai kyonki donon kriyaaon main ek hi utprerak nicotinomide kaary karata he
 • When normal respiration in the cell is interrupted and fermentation takes place, glucose decomposition occurs and the cell dies due to lack of energy
 glucose ke apghaton kaa matlab he khamirikaran dwaara mrityu or avayaviya shwasan kaa matlab he khamirikaran dwaara jivan
 • Cancer occurs only because respiration gives cells the ability to penetrate, not fermentation
 ant main main yahi kahana chahta hoon ki ab cancer koi rahasyamay rog nahin rah gaya he or iskaa pramukh kaaran sabake saamne spasht he
 We should work towards prevention from cancer
 aakhir kab tak chemotherapy or radiotherapy se jude laalchee bahurashtriya santhaan cancer par hui shodh kaa laabh aam logon tak nahin pahunchne denge or unhen bhramit karte rahenge
 Probably till then crores of people in this world will keep dying from this disease
 warburg kaa vyaakhyaan bahut hi rochak tha
 It was such a revolutionary event in the world of science that he first exposed the importance of oxygen in respiration to the world

 Otto several times and expressed his desire to meet him, but Otto did not respond

 According to the famous twentieth century British mathematician and philosopher Bertend Russell, "mathematics can be defined as a subject in which we do not know what we are saying, nor do we know what we are saying
" Whether it is true or not
 ’’ Mathematics is not only a compilation of some abstract concepts and rules, but is also the foundation of daily life
