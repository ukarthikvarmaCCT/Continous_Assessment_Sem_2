 However, the issue between the two countries has not become an issue till now due to coordination between China and North Korea at the government level

 Fatima Jinnah madar-e miltat i
e
 mother of the public, in the life of Qaydeh Azam, madar-e miltat lived effectively for 19 years i
e
 from 1929 to 1948 and death remained the same time after Friday
 hamaare visheshgy itihaas ausajya ne maadar millat ko kaayade ajam ke ghar kii dekhbhaal karne vaali bahan ko lekar bahut buland sthaan diya he lekin unhone sthapana pakistan or khaskar 1965 ke baad ke raajnneetik nakshe par jo ascharyajanak prabhaav chode hai unki taraf adhik dhyaan nahin
 It is a worthwhile thing that in the life of quaid-e-azam, Mater Millat his Hummer uh should live effectively for 19 years i
e
 from 1929 to 1948 and death remained the same time after Friday i
e
 from 1946 to 1967 but in this second phase his own Individuals emerged in such a way and their thoughts and roles came out in such a way that they were able to play the life of quaid-e-azam to save the democratic and transparent political values
 Credit can be given that had forgotten ruler
 is silsile main maadar millat ne jin aara jataai unase samakaleen raajnneetishastra or maamalon par unki zahani pakad naa yogya vishwaas had tak or majboot najar aati he
 In response to the criticism of Job Khan on the occasion of the Presidential election of 1965, Mather Milat himself said that Job can be an expert in military affairs, but political understanding and i have got quaid-e-azam directly and this is an area in which Amar absolutely no longitude is
 1965 ke baad utpann hone vaali ghatnaon madarmalat ke is bayaan kii pushti karne ke liye kaaphi hai
 Some of the dangers identified repeatedly by Mather Miltat, for example, are: madarmalat ne noi anya rashtriya or antarrashtriya maamalon ke barse main sahebaan satta or janata koane vaale khataron se aagaah karne vaale jo vivaran die vah unki dur ras nigahon or raajnneetik doordarshee kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 If we would have listened to Ni Maadar Milat's vision and organized to avoid the dangers that were clearly watching, we would not have been in the grip of radical political, economic and social outlays that would make our nation night and The day is facing up and it seems certain that the Dalkhrash incident site of East Pakistan would not have been developing
 maadar millat raajnneetik jivan chaahe unhone jis andaaz se raat or din bitaye or raashtra or musalamaanon ke liye jo balidaan karen unke andar nishchay ek adarsh bhoomika ke puure karkon hai
 Five of these factors are particularly notable: First: she was an ideal Garillo woman
 vyarth kharachi se puraa parhez or saral lekin aavashyak asishon or suvidhaon se bharpoor ghar 'kaayade ajam ke liye bhojan or aaraam kaa ek pranali alaav kaat' saitiya chahal pahal or malakatyon ke bheed ke ba vajood par aaraam maahaul 'kaayade ajam apni gir mayon ke ant main jab ghar lautate to apane swaagat ke liye ek khandaan or shaadaan bahan ko maujuud pate
 This was the satisfying and peaceful Indigenous atmosphere in which, despite his illness, quaid-e-azam was able to achieve the full success and movement of Pakistan with a needle
 do: maadar millat jivan se ek mahatvapurn sabak yah miltaa he ki mahilaon ko pro feshnal shiksha aa rasta honachahe taaki vah aarthik rup se aatmanirbhar hai or rashtriya aay main bhi vruddhi kar saken
 Mather Millat received a crush on the dentist and spent many years working on it and giving free treatment to the poor during this period
 swayamsevak: madarmalat apane jivan kaa lagbhag hissaa beshumaar saamaajik or rafahi santhaan sir sati keval or unki pragati or vikaas main daame, orame 'sakhane madad kii lekar kashmiri apravasiyon ke liye sevaaon naa yogya fra mosh hai
 Fourth: The most important achievement of Madar Miltat is to make Pakistan walk on the path of democracy
 She participated in the 1965 presidential election by refreshing memories of the movement Pakistan's public substance and the feelings of a juggling and passion between East and West Pakistan
 Made aware haalanki unhen dhaandhlee se haraaya gaya lekin iskaa nateeja kuch saalon ke andar ayyub khan kii sainya shaasha ke ant ke rup main niklaa
 The message for the women of Pakistan in the political struggle is that it should not be related to political science
 apane bheetar raajnneetik chetana paidaa karnaa chahie or chunaav main bharpoor bhaag lekar mahab desh or eemaandaar logon ko safal bananaa chahie
 V: Despite walking in the corridors of power in high circles, Madre lived according to Iranian Islamic shayar and protected himself from all kinds of scams
 vah kaayade ajam kii tarah behad atmabhimaan or par pratishtha thi vah ekta islamic ke prashansak thim or unki baari dast khawayash thi ki yuva chaatr ke liye kuran majid kii shiksha ko aavashyak bataaya he
 It is the duty of women and especially girls to study the hyatt and services of the dear sister of quaid-e-azam and inculcate within them at least the qualities mentioned above
 inhen visheshtaon kii badaulat mahilaon raashtra vikaas or nirmaan main bharpoor andaaz main yogadan kar sakati hai
 Madre Irani a study of some new Afroz views: Madre Milat's Hyatt and Services shows that Pakistan had a clear idea about the construction and development and development policies of society
 jaisaa ki pehle bhi kaha gaya he unhen keval ek gharelu mahila samajhnaa sahi nahin hoga
 She lived for 19 years after the death of quaid-e-azam and offered her prayers with Tawatur about the political, economic, social and educational problems of the country
 punjab vishvavidhyalay anusandhan socity of pakistan ne do sau se adhik takarirathpi hai or iske alaava aantarik or bahari maamalon par unke naye afaroz tippanee anya pustakon rasyle main baghre pade hai
 quaid-e-azam was not present to guide these thoughts and statements
 maadar millat apane liye pustaken biniya or adhyayan kii behad shaukeen thim or vibhinn maamalon main swatantra dhang se sochati thim
 No analytics writing has been seen yet about his thoughts and opinions
 yahan namoonay ke rup main unke chaar bayanon darj kiye jate hai jo samasyaon kii fikri pakad kaa pataa chalata he: Islamic teachings: At this time the world is going through a strange phase and it is difficult to say what will be the result of the struggle
 At this time, the biggest problem that has been a pain for the whole world is that how did noi become a human being and established equality and equality 





 kashmir: tab pakistan ko vibhinn muddon kaa saamana he or yah siddh amar he ki inamen kashmir sabase mahatvapurn he
 From the point of view, Kashmir holds the life and soul of Pakistan
 aarthik lihaaz se kashmir hamaari marafi samay strot he
 Pakistan's big rivers would pass through the border of the same state and enter Pakistan and give it to our well-being, without it Pakistan's time would be in danger
 agar khuda na kare ham kashmir se vanchit hone par prakruti kii di gai nemat pad kaa bada hissaa hamase chhin jayega
 Kashmir is the main point of our trouble
 agar dushman kashmir sundarat ghati or pahaado main morcha banane kaa mauka mil jaae to phir yah atal amar he ki hamaare maamalon main hastkshep or custom chalaane kii koshish karegaa
 So in order to make ourselves a strong and truly powerful nation, it is very important that Pakistan should not be caught in the grip of such enemy activities
 In this context, our first duty of Kashmir becomes
 aantarik sthirataa: aaj sthiti kya he? aantarik rup se ham uddeshy prakriya ke gathbandhan se vanchit hai bahari taur par hamen vah sammaan or aadar nahin jiske ham yogya hai
 You wonder nafs and think on who is his responsibility, certainly you do not present the hurdles that were presented before the freedom compared to the two great powerful, because it is because you have failed to produce the leadership that has so far Support of ideas and equality from Delhi? What is the reason that you have understood the meaning of freedom as comfort and ease rather than hard work and struggle? Is it because of your Enemies are given the opportunity he was creating chaos Sfon of retrievable in disguise friends Krenaor Pakistan came into existence Smjrjh you Bhkaaajn these ideas
 ye aise prashn hai jinka uttar khud aap ko dena chahie
 Nowadays big things are happening here on foreign policy and foreign affairs, but i am of the opinion that the truth is very little interference in these things
 sabase swaagat he ki ham sthiti ko sadhaarein, agrahako mat ko raajnneetik or aarthik sthirataa praapt ho jaae to use videsh bhi sammaan naseeb hoti he
 His foreign policy may or may not be liked by anyone but is seen with respect
 ;loktantr: hamaare raste main aantarik or bahari samasyaon aade hui hai
 We have gone through different issues
 We have had troubled moments, but our faith has not been lost and we have not been disappointed
 aaj das saal baad hamen is baat kaa surveykshan karnaa chahie ki ham saarvajanik aamangon paane main kitni safal hue
 Pakistan was not set up to be a hunting ground for some people like Jah, where they kept getting fat by pulling on the tears, sweat and blood of millions of people
 pakistan saamaajik nyaay, samanta, asut, samuhik bhalaai, shanti or anand kii prapti ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Today we are thrown away for this purpose
 aapako pataa hona chahie ki yah chupa hua haath kiskaa he jisane saarvajanik jivan main zehar ghol diya he nijee hiton or satta ke liye shadyantra or moltol ke rujhaan bad rahe hai
 Efforts are being made to deprive the people of the use of Jamvari rights
 aapako samvidhan kii raksha or gaiyr loktantr rujhaan ko rokane ke liye ekajute hona chahie, jaldi chunaav kii maang hi is sthiti kaa ekmaatr samaadhaan he
 i appeal to the Pakistanis to stand firm against the people who spread pollination in the country and continue to move towards democracy

 There is also a lot of controversy about them
 ankit kii vidyalayan shiksha army public skool se hui
 He started a website called "hacking Truths", which he claimed to be the "second best hacking site in the world that the FBI also believed"
 unka daawa he ki jab ve 14 varsh ke the, unhon ek bhartiya patrika kii website ke mukhya prishth ko tresh kiya tha
 He then sent an e-mail editor acknowledging the hack and suggested measures to prevent hacking
 15 varsh kii aayu main inaki pustak athical hekking ne inhen sabase kam aayu kaa lekhak banaaya, jise bhartiya macmillan ne prakashit kiya
 Fadia denied that many publications had given false information that they were associated with the FBI or CIA

 Fadia studied at Stanford University before graduating
 zad di nait britain kii wendi mcoliphe ke anusaar, bhale hi faadia kii hekking truths website ko "duniya ke duusare sabase achche hekking site" ke rup main efabiai ne manyata di ho, par hekking citon ne ise koi sthaan nahin diya he

 In Corinth, Philip founded the "hellenic Alliance", which included most of the Greek city-states except Sparta
 philip ko is lig ke naam par hegon naam diya gaya, or usne farsi samrajya par hamalaa karne kii apni yojana kii ghoshnaa kii
 When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Iridis, the niece of his commander Atalus
 is vivaah se sikandar kii uttaradhikari ke rup main daavedaari sakant main aa gai, kyonki cleopetra iridis se utpann betaa puri tarah se macedonion uttaradhikari hota, jabaki sikandar keval aadha macedonion tha
 During the wedding feast, the drunken Atlas publicly prayed to the gods that a legitimate heir would now be born in the Macedonia
 sikandar apni maa ke saath mecedon se bhaag kar, use apane mamaa, epirus ke raja alexander pratham ke paas dodona main chhod diya
 And himself went to Illyria, where he sought protection from the Illyrian king
 kuch saal purv sikandar se ladaai main parajeet hone ke baavjood usne sikandar kaa atithi ke taur par swaagat kiya
 However, it appears that Philip never wanted to reject his politician and military-trained son
 tadanusaar, sikandar ek pariwarik dost, dameratus ke prayaason ke kaaran chah maheene ke baad macedoniyaan waapas laut aata hai
 In the following year, Pixodaras, the Persian governor of Caria proposed marriage to his eldest daughter, Alexander's half-brother, Philippe Erhidius
 olympius or sikandar ke kai doston ne suzav diya ki philip ne arhidiyas ko apana uttaradhikari banane kaa iraadaa kiya he
 Alexander sent an angel to Thessalyus to tell Thessalus that he should give his daughter's hand to Alexander instead of giving it to the illegitimate son
 jab philip ne is bare main suna to usne prastaav vaarta ko roak diya or sikandar ko chillaate hue kaha ki vah cu pixodaras kii beti se shaadi karnaa chahta he, usne samajhaayaa ki vah uske liye behatar dulhan chahta tha
 Philip deported four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Narcus, Ptolemy, and Arizius, and sent the Corinthians to bring Thessalus into chains
 336 isa purv kii garmiyon main, eige main apni beti cleopetra ke vivaah main bhaag lete hue philip ko uske angrakshakon ke captain, posnis dwaara hatya kar di gai
 When Posnis attempted to escape, Alexander's two companions, Perdicus and Leonatus, followed and killed him
 usee samay, 20 varsh kii umr main sikandar ko raison or sena dwaara raja ghoshit kar diya gaya
 As soon as he took the throne, Alexander started destroying his rivals
 jisaki shuruyaat usne apane chachere bhai, purv amintas chauthe kii hatya karavaake kii
 He also killed two Macedonian princes of the Lancastes region, though leaving a third, Alexander Lancastes
 olympius ne cleopetra iridiis or europa ko, joki philip kii beti thi, jinda jala diya
 When Alexander came to know about this, he was outraged
 sikandar ne atlus kii hatya kaa bhi aadesh diya, joki cleopetra ke chachaa or asia abhiyaan kii sena kaa agrim senapati tha
 Atalus had gone to Athens at that time to talk to Demothanes about the possibility of his loss
 atlus ne sikandar kaa kai baar ghor apmaan kar chukaa tha, or cleopetra kii hatya ke baad, sikandar use jivit chhodane ke liye bahut khatarnaak maanata tha
 Alexander left Erhidius, who was mentally handicapped, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias
 philip kii mrityu kii khabar se kai rajyon main vidroh hone laga, jinamein thibs, athens, thisli or macedon ke uttar main thresian janajati shaamil the
 When news of the rebellion reached Alexander, he immediately noticed it
 kootneeti kaa istemaal karne ki bajaay, sikandar 3,000 macedonian ghudsavaar sena kaa gathan kar, thisli kii taraf dakshin main kooch karne laga
 He found that Thistley's army, occupying the path between Mount Olympus and Mount Osa, ordered his army to climb Mount Osa
 duusare din jab thislian sena jaagi, to paaya ki sikandar apni sena ke saath unke peeche khadaa tha, or unhone turant aatmasamarpan kar diya
 Alexander joined his cavalry and started marching south towards the Peloponnese
 sikandar thermopyle main rukaa, jahaan use amfictionik lig ke netaa ke rup main chunaa gaya, phir vah waha se dakshin kii ore corinth ki ore nikal gaya
 Athens pleaded for peace, which Alexander accepted and pardoned the rebels
 sikandar or diojanij diogens da sinik ke bich prasiddh mulaakaat corinth main rahane ke dauraan hui thi
 When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for them, the philosopher disgustingly asked Alexander to stand aside, as he was blocking the sunlight
 is hajir jawaab se alexander ko khush hua, or usne kaha kii "agar main sikandar nahin hota, to main diogens bananaa chahta"
 In Corinth, Alexander was given the title of hegemon as Philip was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia
 yahan use thresian vidroh kii khabar bhi praapt hui
 Before crossing Asia, Alexander wanted to secure his northern borders
 335 isa purv ke vasant main, vah kai vidrohon dabaane ke liye chal padaa
 Starting from Ampolis, he traveled eastward into the country of "independent Thracians"; And on Mount Hemus, the Macedonian army also defeated and defeated the Thracian armies at the heights
 aage sena tribali desh main ghus gaye or unhone unki sena ko laijinas nadi ke paas haraaya
 Alexander made a three-day journey to the Danube, and encountered the Gatte tribe on the opposite bank on the way
 raat ko hi nadi paar karte hue, usne unhen aashcharyachakit kar diya or pehali ghudsavaar jhadap ke baad unki sena ko peeche hatane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 It was up to Alexander when the news reached that the king of Celsius, Illyria, and Gluaki, the king of Tualanti, were rebelling against him in the open
 vah pashchim main ilariria ki ore rukh kiya, sikandar ne ek ke baad ek dono ko haraane ke baad, dono shaskaon ko apni saina ke saath bhaagane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 With these victories, he had secured his northern border
 jab sikandar apane uttar ke abhiyaan main tha, use thibs or athenian ke ek baar phir se vidroh ki jaankaree mili or sikandar turant dakshin kii ore chal padaa
 While others were hesitating to collide with Alexander, Thebes decided to fight
 thibs kaa pratirodh aprabhavi tha, or sikandar ne unhain pachhad shahar ko kabje main le liya or or is kshetra ko anya bootian shaharon ke bich main baant diya
 The end of Thebes silenced Athens and temporarily brought peace to all of Greece
 tab sikandar antipeter ko raaj-pratinidhi ke rup main chhod, apane asian abhiyaan nikal gaya
 After Spitomenes' death and his new marriage to Roxena, Alexander moved his attention to the Indian subcontinent
 usne gandhar ke sabhi pramukhon ko aamantrit kar, unhen apane adhikaar kshetra sikandar ke adheen karne ke liye kaha
 Ambhi, the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus River to the Jhelum River, accepted it, but the chieftains of some hilly regions, including the Ashwanyas and Ashwakyanas of the Kamboj region, refused to oblige
 aambhi ne sikandar ko dosti kaa yakeen dilaane or unhen moolyawaan uphaaron dene, uske sabhi sena ke saad khud uske paas gaya
 Alexander not only returned him his rank and gifts, but he gifted Ambi "persian clothes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 gold talents"
 sikandar ne apni sena baant di, or ambi ne sindhu nadi par pul ke nirmaan karne main hipastian or pedricus kii madad kii, saath hi uske sainikon ko bhojan kii aapurti karata rahaa
 He welcomed Alexander and his entire army with the most generous hospitality in his capital, Taxila city, in the greatest display of friendship
 sikandar ke aage badhane par, takshashila ne uski 5,000 logon kii ek sena kii madad ke saath, jhelum nadi kii ladaai main hissaa bhi liya
 After victory in this war, Alexander sent Ambi to negotiate with the Purvas, offering conditions like subduing the whole kingdom of Porus to Sikandar, since Ambi and Porus were old enemies, he rejected all the terms and Ambi with great difficulty
 Saved his life and escaped from there
 haalanki iske baad, donon pratidwandviyon ko sikandar ne vyaktigat madhyasthata se mail milaap kara diya; or takshashila ko, jhelum par bede ke liye upkaran or sanybal ke yogadan ke kaaran, aambhi ko jhelum nadi or sindhu ke bich kaa puraa kshetra saunpa diya gaya; machaatas ke bete philip kii mrityu ke baad use or shakti mil gai; sikandar kii maut ke baad or 321 isa purv triparadisus main praanton ke vibhaajan baad ke bhi use apane adhikaar ko barkaraar rakhane kii anumati di gai
 In the winters of 327 / 326 BC, Alexander led an expedition against regional tribes such as the Espacioi of the Kunar valleys, the Guaranis of the Gurus valley, and the Asenaki of the Swat and Buner valleys
 aspisioi ke saath ek bhayankar ladaai shuru hui jisamen sikandar kaa kandhaa ek bhaalaa se ghayal ho gaya, lekin aakhirkaar aspisioi haar gaya
 Alexander then faced Assakenoi, who fought the strongholds of Massaga, Ora, and Aaron
 massaga kaa kila ek khooni ladaai ke baad hi jeeta ja sakaa, isamen sikandar kaa takhnaa gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaya tha
 According to Curtius, "not only did Alexander kill the entire population of Massaga, but turned all his buildings into rubble
 " isi prakaar kaa narsanhaar ora main bhi kiya gaya
 After Massaga and Ora, many Ascensians fled to the fortress of Arones
 sikandar ne unka peechha kiya or chaar dinon kii khooni ladaai ke baad is ranneetik pahari-kile par kabja kar liya
 After the Arones, Alexander crossed the Indus in 326 BCE and won a great war against King Porus, who ruled the region between the Jhelum and the Chenab River, which is now the territory of Punjab
 sikandar, poras kii bahaduree se kaaphi prabhavit hue, or use apana ek sahyogi bana liya
 He appointed Porus as his vice-chancellor, and annexed the territory to his own conquest southeast to the Beas River

 Conflict resolution refers to the method or process of ending a conflict peacefully
 yathartwaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti rajyon ke madhya shakti hetu sangharsh he
 Other scholars also believe that international politics is a form of processes taking place under different states
 parantu sabhi rajyon ke rashtriya hit samaan nahin hote atah rajyon ke madhya sangharsh anivaary ban jaataa he
 The nature, subject area and capacity of conflicts may vary
 shaayad isi kaaran sangharshon ke samaadhaan ke bare main jaanane se purv sangharshon ke swaroop va prakaar ke bare main sankshipt jaankaree bhi ati aavashyak ho jaati he
 In general conflicts can be divided into two parts - non-violent and violent
 dekhne se yah prathit hota he ki is vargeekaran ke aadhaar par sangharshon ke swaroop ko samajhnaa bahut aasaan he
 But due to the origin of the most modern weapons of military means in today's context, it is not so easy to find out whether such a struggle is violent or non-violent
 kai baar hinsaatmak pravritiyon kaa dikhaava maatr karke raashtra apane hiton kii purti kar lete hai
 Therefore, detailed knowledge of their interests becomes essential for information about the conflict
 isiilie kai lekhak vishleshnatmak drushti se sangharshon ko nimnlikhit do pramukh shreniyon main baant dete hai - In the period of change of international politics, power remains divided and instability persists
 aise main rajyon ke paas keval simit vikalp hi rah jate hai
 Therefore, in the event of your struggles, only tries to achieve the purpose of balance
 un sangharshon ko santulit-uddeshyon hetu sangharsh kehete hai
 The following types of conflicts can be included in this category - shityudh kaal main sangharsh purv soviet sangh evam america ke madhya sangharshatmak dwandv kaa paryaayavachi ban gaya tha
 The conflict between the two had become based on arms race, development of military capability, establishment of military bases, control over raw materials, constant search for allies, etc
 iske parinamswaroop donon hi manovaigyanik rup se ek duusare par varchasv sthapit karne kii hode main lage rahete the
 In this type of struggle, the state, along with expanding its power, became engrossed in organizing the group and making it more competitive
 is prakaar se vishwa purna rup se vaicharik rup main do guton main bant gaya
 This type of struggle can be called a 'struggle for domination'
 is prakaar ke sangharsh hetu lambi duuri kii yojanaayen banani padati hai tathaa yah nirantar chalati rahati hai
 Apart from this, the possibility of total war between the two also prevails in this situation
 sangharshon ko prarambh karnaa to aasaan hota he, lekin unako lambe samay tak jari rakhana ati kathin hota he
 Therefore, every nation wants to avoid conflicts
 parantu ek baar sangharsh prarambh hone par chaar vikalpon ke madhyam se hi unase bachaa ja saktaa he- The second situation is the best, but this is possible only when both rivals want to compromise and have the same views in terms of their minimum achievement
 anirnayatak sthiti jab aati he jab donon pratibhaagi adiyal ho va laabh-haani anishchit ho
 These types of conflicts break up without any appearances
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main sangharsh kii sthiti rajyon dwaara unke samaadhaan ke vibhinn sadhano va takneekon ke khojane par bal detii he
 But the search for these tools and their success depends on the objectives of the struggle, the nature and the interests of the opposing parties

 In September 2007, the first metro line from Sikanderpur to National Highway 8 was proposed
 haryana shahari vikaas praadhikaran ne 2008 main 99 saal ke patte ke saath bilt-oparate-transfar aadhaar par metro line banane ke liye prastaav aamantrit kiye
 However, real estate developer DLF wanted metro connectivity to its cyber city
 july 2008 main ek nai nivida jari kii gai, jisamen dlef-lephes concortium ekmaatr bolidaata ke rup main upasthit the
 The project was initially conceived as a collaborative venture between DLF and Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services, but DLF pulled out of the project due to some financial problems, and ILFS became the sole owner of the metro system

 Rapid Metro did not even get the 20 acres of land it was supposed to give to the state government for the first phase of construction
 rapid metro duniya kii pehali puri tarah se nijee rup se vitt poshit metro pranali he
 The project was implemented as a public-private partnership
 pariyojna kii puri laagat nijee party dwaara lee gai thi or haryana sarkaar ne keval lij hold ke aadhaar par bhoomi pradaan kii thi
 The same private organization was also entrusted with the maintenance and operation of the metro at its own cost

 In July 2009, a contract worth Rs 9 billion was awarded for the project on the condition of completion in 30 months time
 is pariyojna kii neenv 11 agast 2009 ko rakhi gai
 The estimated cost of the project as of October 2012 was Rs 10
88 billion
 mul rup se ise 2012 main kholane kii yojana banaai gai thi, lekin ise 14 november 2012 ko janata ke liye kholaa gaya
 The line was constructed by Rapid Metro Gurgaon Limited, and is also operated by him
 oktober 2012 main jis din pratham charan ke phej 2 or phej 3 steshnon ke bich pareekshan ran yojit kiye gaye the, usee din haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ne pariyojna ke charan 2 kii aadharshila rakhi thi
 On 11 June 2013, ILFS Engineering and Construction Company Limited informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that it was awarded a contract of Rs 266
5 crore to construct elevated viaducts for the second phase of the project
 company ne yah bhi kaha ki pariyojna 24 maheene ke bheetar puri kii jaaegi
 The company was also subsequently awarded a contract of Rs 84
3 crore for the construction of all 5 elevated stations in the second phase, whose completion period was specified as 24 months only

 windos vista microsoft ke oparating system kii shrinkhalaa kii sabase nai kadi he or sambhawatah windos 95 ke pashchaat sabase krantikari bhi
 Although the Vista operating system has gained more popularity due to its three-dimensional graphics format and various desktop animations, it is in fact considered to be the most secure operating system ever released by Microsoft
 sanchaar or netwarking ke lihaaj se bhi yah apane se pichley aaparating system kii tulana main zyada kshamtawan he
 Hindi support for Vista is also fully available and through the Hindi Language Interface Pack, Windows Vista can be fully painted in Hindi
 computer upyogkartaaon ke man main jigyaasa he ki kya sachmuch unhen microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya nayaa oparating system windos vista apnaane kii jarurat he
 Does Microsoft's previous operating systems Windows XP Windows 2003 and Windows 2000 have such features that it is not possible to ignore
 microsoft kaa daawa he ki vista pichley windos kii tulana main adhik sakasham, saral, tej, sudarshan or surakshit he
 Vista opens and closes faster than previous operating systems
 start ap or shat down prakriyaayein paanch se das second main puri ho jaati hai
 Although Vista's relatively better hardware also contributes to this, special efforts have been made in the code of the operating system itself
 vista kii teji kaa kaaran uski memri ke prabandhan kii nai takanic bhi he jo adhik istemaal kiye jane vaale anuprayogon ko pehle se hi loding ke liye taiyaar rakhti he
 This is called 'memory fetch'
 vista main die gaye ready boost feechar ne bhi isaki gati badhaane main yogadan diya he
 Until now, pagefiles were used as virtual memory to meet additional memory requirements in Windows
 inhen computer kii hard discs par rakhaa jaataa tha
 But Vista has a provision of using a USB drive that works at a much faster speed than a hard disk
 microsoft ne apane nae aaparating system main hybrid hard drive saport bhi pradaan kiya he jiske tahat flash drive or paaramparik hard drive donon ko sanyukt rup se istemaal kar computer kii gati badha jaati he
 One of the first things to get noticed in Windows Vista is its beautiful vocal and graphic effects called Windows Aero
 haalaanki maikintosh computer par is tarah ke sudarshan graphics pehle se hi maujuud hai lekin windos plateform par ye pehali baar 'vista' ke madhyam se hi saamne aae hai
 On computers with Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions that have a good graphics adapter, Aero's stunning graphics effects can be enjoyed
 is mukhaawaran ne windos kaa kalevar hi badal diya he or use pehle kii tulana main behad aakarshak, vividhtapurna or shaleen bana diya he
 Aero's high quality graphics and visual effects enhance the beauty of a Windows computer but it does not impair the functionality or speed of the computer

 aam taur par microsoft ke aaparating systamon ko lekar computer upyogkartaaon main yah dharna rahi he ki ve apane pratidwandvi oparating systamon kii tulana main kam surakshit hai or virus, hekking, spa ware aadi kii chapet main apekshaakrit adhik aasaani se aa jate hai
 Microsoft has paid special attention to this in Vista
 haalaanki vista kii mul 'karnel' to nae sire se nahin likhi he lekin uski suraksha ko is baar bahut majboot bana diya gaya he
 First of all, now not all parts of this operating system run in kernel mode, but only a select few of them run
 vista main zyaadaatar driver or software yujar mod main chalate hai or karnel mod main kisi bhi na cheez ko install karnaa aasaan nahin rah gaya he
 This requires security certificate and administrator level rights
 or administrator str ke visheshadhikaar praapt karnaa, visheshkar daftaron main, ab bahut mushkil hoga
 Windows Vista has limited common user rights
 aisa bhi nahin he ki aap bataur saamaanya upyogkarta ke apane computer main ko software instaal hi na kar paaen
 To do this, they get the necessary rights temporarily
 microsoft ne vista aaparating system install karne ke lihaaj se computaron kii do shreniyan banaai hai- vista capable pisi or vista premium ready 
 All such computers are Windows Vista enabled with at least 800 mhz processor and 512 MB system memory available
 is tarah ke procesar to ab durlabh se ho gaye hai kyonki bazaar main 2 gigahatrj se kam ke procesar shaayad hi koi kharid rahaa ho
 If you have bought your computer in the last two years, then its processor will have at least this much capacity
 rahi system memri kii baat to ho saktaa he ki aapke paaramparik computer main 128 embi yaa 256 embi memri lagi ho
 In such a situation, you may have to upgrade your RAM by spending seven to eight hundred rupees
 windos vista sakasham computer ke liye kam se kam diarect eks 9 ko samarthan dene vaala graphics card hona chahie jisamen dabludidm driver samarthan uplabdh ho

 Mobile 8 newton ke gati niyam teen bhautik niyam hai jo chirsmmat yantriki ke aadhaar hai
 These rules describe the relationship between the force exerted on an object and the speed of that object
 inhen teen sadiyon main anek prakaar se vyakt kiya gaya he
 Newton's three laws of motion, traditionally, are summarized as follows: sabase pehle newton ne inhe apane granth philasphi nechuralis principia mathematica main sankalit kiya tha
 Newton used them to explain the problems related to the motion of physical objects in many places
 apane granth ke tritiy bhaag main newton ne darshaya ki gati ke ye teenon niyam or unke saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa niyam sammilit rup se kepler ke akashiya pindon kii gati se sambandhit niyam kii vyakhya karne main samarth hai
 Newton's law of motion is applied only to those objects which we can consider as a particle
 matlab ki un vastuon kii gati ko napate samay unke aakar ko nazarandaz kiya jaataa he
 These rules are applied by considering the objects of those objects centered in a single point
 aisa tab kiya jaataa he jab vishleshan main dooriyaan vastuyon kii tulana main kaaphi bade hote he
 Therefore, the planets can be measured as a particle and their orbital speed can be measured
 apane mul rup main in gati ke niyamo ko drudh or virupanshil pindon par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1750, Leonard Euler expanded Newton's speed rules and created Euler's speed rules that could also be applied to rigid and deformable bodies
 yadi ek vastu ko asatat kanon kaa ek sangyojan mana jaye, jiname alag-alag kar ke newton ke gati niyam lagaaye ja sakate he, to ular ke gati niyam ko newton ke gati niyam se viyuttpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Newton's laws of motion also apply in some direction systems, called inertial direction systems
 kai lekhako kaa maananaa he ki pratham niyam jadtviya nirdesh tantra ko paribhaashit karata he or dwitiya niyam sirf unhi nirdesh tantron se main maanya he isi kaaran se pehle niyam ko dusre niyam kaa ek vishesh rup nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But some consider the first rule to be the result of the second
 nirdesh tantron kii spasht avadharana newton ke marane ke kaaphi samay pashchaat viksit hui
 Newtonian mechanics has now been replaced by Einstein's theory of special relativity, but it is still used for objects at a speed less than the speed of light
 newton ke mul shabdon main Hindi translation "prayek vastu apane sthiravastha athwa ekasmaan vegavastha me tab tak rahati he jab tak use kisi bahya kaarak dwaara avasthaa main badlaav ke liye prerit nahin kiya jaataa
 " duusare shabdon main, jo vastu viraam avasthaa main he vah viraam avasthaa main hi rahegi tathaa jo vastu gatiman hai vah gatiman hi rahegi jab tak ki us par bhi koi bahari bal naa lagaaya jaae
 Newton's first law defines inertia, a natural property of matter that opposes changes in momentum
 isliye pratham niyam ko jadtv kaa niyam bhi kehete he
 This rule also indirectly defines the inertial reference system and force
 iske kaaran newton dwaara is niyam ko pratham rakhaa gaya
 Simple authentication of this rule is difficult because the bodies feel the effects of friction and gravity
 asal main newton se pehle galileo ne is prekshan kaa varnan kiya
 Newton expressed it in other words
 newton ke mul shabdo main : Translation in hindi " kisi vastu ke samveg me aayaa badlaav us vastu par aropit dhakke ke samaanupati hota he tathaa samaan disha main ghatit hota he
 "the following points can be arranged by Newton's law: jahaan f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} bal, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} samveg or t { \ displaystyle t} samay hai
 According to this equation, when there is no external force on a body, the momentum of the body remains constant
 jab pind kaa dravyaman sthir hota he, to sameekaran zyaada saral rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Where m { \ displaystyle m} is mass and a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} is acceleration
 yani kisi pind kaa twaran aropit bal ke anukramanupati he
 The impulse relates to the Second Rule
 aaveg kaa matlab he samveg main parivartan
 meaning: jahaan i aaveg he
 Very important in the analysis of impulse collisions
 mana ki kisi pind kaa dravyaman m he
 Applying a rule force f to this for ान्तt time period, the velocity changes to ∆v
 tab newton- Therefore, the impulse given to a body is similar to the change in momentum produced in the body
 at: aaveg kaa maatrak vahi hota he jo samveg kaa he
 The third law means that there is another force corresponding to a force that is equal and opposite to it
 newton ne is niyam ko istemaal karke samveg sangrakshan ke niyam kaa varnan kiya, lekin asal main samveg sangrakshan ek adhik moolbhoot siddhant he
 There are many examples in which momentum is preserved but the third rule is not valid

 The ascetic Mahavir used to roam in a naked state due to being silent and impassive

 ye panch parameshthi hai
 Just as Kaal is divided in Manvantar kalpa etc
 in Hindus, similarly Kaal in Jain is of two types - Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 avasarpini kaal main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan,aayu,bal ityadi ghatata he jabaki utsarpini main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan or aayu, bal ityadi badhata he in donon kaa kaalmaan das krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he arthath ek samaychakra bees krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he

 The Jains have divided their texts into Agam, Purana etc
 pro jecobi aadi ke aadhunik anveshanon ke anusaar yah siddh kiya gaya he kii jain dharm buddha dharm se pehle kaa he
 The antiquity of Jainism is also found from the inscriptions of Udayagiri, Junagadh etc
 hindu granth, skanda puraana ke anusaar: "rishabhdev nabhiraj ke putr the, rishabh ke putr bharat the, or inke hi naam par is desh kaa naam "bharatvarsh" padaa"| In Indian astrology, the style of the Greeks propagated three hundred years behind the Vikram Samvat

 Just as the Ved Samhita of the Brahmins has a five-year age and constellations are counted from the Kritika, similarly the Jana texts are also in the scriptures
 isse unki pracheenta siddh hoti he
 After Lord Mahavira, there have been many sages and acharyas in this tradition, the main of which are- tirthankar mahavir ke samay tak avichhin rahi jain parampara isa kii teesri sadi main do bhaagon main vibhakt ho gayi : digambar or shwetambar
 Muni Pramanasagar ji has written in detail on this division of Jains in his work 'jainism and Philosophy' that Acharya Bhadrabahu knew on the strength of his knowledge that a severe famine of 12 years is going to happen in North India, so he gave all the sadhus Instructed that to avoid this terrible famine, one should travel to South India
 acharya bhadrabahu ke saath hajaaron jain muni dakshin kii ore vartmaan ke tamilnadu or karnataka kii ore prasthaan kar gaye or apni sadhana main lage rahe
 But some Jain monks stayed in North India itself
 akaal ke kaaran yahan ruke hue saadhuon kaa nirvaah aagmanuroop nahin ho paa rahaa tha isliye unhone apni kai kriyaayein shithil kar leen, jaise kati vastra dhaaran karnaa, 7 gharon se bhiksha grahan karnaa, 14 upkaran saath main rakhana aadi
 After 12 years, the sadhus who returned from the south saw all this and they explained to the sadhus residing here that you once again adopted the tradition of Tirthankara Mahavir, but the sadhus did not agree and then Digambara and Shvetambara became two sects in Jainism
 digambar sadhu vastra nahin pahante he, nagn rahete hai or sadhviyaan shwet vastra dhaaran karti hai
 In Digambar Matha, the idols of the Tirthakaras are made completely naked and they are not adorned
 digambar samudaay teen bhaagon vibhakt hai
 Shwetambars and Sadhvis and Saints wear white robes, idols of Tirthakaras are made and decorated with metal eyes, coils on the idol
 shwetambar bhi do bhaag me vibhakt he: Sthanavasi also has two parts: - digambar aacharyon dwaara samast jain aagam grantho ko chaar bhaago main baanta gaya he - Elementary Sutra - Granth accepted by all Jains pramukh jain granth hai :- Kalpasutra jain dharm ke pramukh tyohaar is prakaar hai

 The stalk of each single flower is called a pedicle
 ek phool ki ek unnati kaa hissaa nahin he to ek ekaant phool kaha jaataa he or iske tana bhi karne ke liye ek danthal ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 a flower can be sent as any flower in a inflorescence
 unnati, saral yaa jatil ho saktaa he
 The inflorescence can be of several types, including a single, mixed, amble, spike or racem
 pushpakram main kaise phool danthal par vyavasthit kar rahe hai sahit kai alag visheshtaon dwaara bataae gaye, phulon ke khilne kram or phulon kii kaise vibhinn samoohon ke bheetar ise samoohikrut kar rahe hai
 These terms are general representations as can a combination of plant types in nature
 ibratiet pushpakram:koi sahapatr pushpakram main nahin hai
 Bratiate inflorescence: very specialized, sometimes divided to or shorter scales, in the covalent inflorescence
 patteydaar pushpakram :haalanki aksar aakaar main kam, sahapatr naa vishisht hai or shabd phool stem pushpakram ke bajaay aam taur par lagu kiya jaataa he taaki sanyantr, ke theth pattiyon kii tarah dekho
 Despite their 'normal' appearance, these leaves are, in fact, considered coterminous, so this use is technically correct, so that 'leafy inflorescence' is superior
 patteydaar sahapatr sahit pushpakram :bratiet or patteydaar pushpakram ke bich madhyavarti
 Many cohorts exist and they have to be strictly attached to the stem, so as in the family Asteraceae, cohorts can be collectively called a membrane
 yadi unnati kii ek duusari ikai ko danthal sahapatr aage, ve ek involucel kaha ja saktaa he
 Terminal flower plant organs can develop according to two different insurance schemes, namely monopodial or racemose and sympodial or samos
 saral unnati 1-private part uncertain or racemose resim, racimos unnati kaa mukhya prakaar he
 a spike is not a pedicle is a type of Rasim with flowers
 ek rasimos samay flats main sabase upar yaa apane bahari tandi jo uttarottar bhitari logon kii tulana ab kar rahe hai kaaran uttal he ek shakha, anishchit unnati he
 There is a flower head or capitulum in which the single sessile flowers share a very contracted succule bearing on an enlarged stem

 ganit main sam aisi sankhyaon ko kaha jaataa he jo 2 dwaara purnatah vibhajya hon, jaise ki 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ityadi
 Another way of saying this is that all even numbers are multiples of 2
 is se vipareet visham ank aise ankon ko kaha jaataa he, jo 2 dwaara vibhajya nahin hote, jaise 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, aadi
 Although the concept of even-odd was originally applied to digits, in modern mathematics it is also applied to other things
 kisi chiz kii ganitiya samta uskaa vah lakshan hoti he jo yah batalaaye ki vah sam he yaa visham
 If a number is even, its last digit is also the same and similarly the last digit of an odd number can also be odd

 Management development is the process by which managers learn their managerial skills and make them more advanced
 kisi bhi sanghathan kii safalataa main uske prabandhak atyant hi mahatvapurn hote hai
 Without an adequate number of competent managers, no organization can expect to take the place of specialty, notwithstanding other valuable resources such as capital, technology and others
 prayek sanghathan main ye prabandhak hi hote hai jo ki sansadhano evam kriyakalapon kaa niyojan sanghathan, nirdesan evam niyantran karte he
 From time to time, due to recognition of the importance of development of management talents, these days most organizations have started giving more attention to management development
 kushal prabandhak hi sanghathanon ko samyaanukool nishchit gati pradaan kar sakate hai
 In the coming times, while the business environment will become more dynamic and complex, the importance of managers will also increase progressively

 The difference of electric potentials of any two points is called voltage or voltage
 duusare shabdon main, ikai dhanavesh ko ek bindu se duusare bindu tak le jane main kiye gaye kaary ko un do binduon ke bich kaa vibhavaantar kehete hai
 The potential is measured by a voltmeter
 voltata, kisi sthitik vidyut kshetra ke dwaara, vidyut dhara ke dwaara, kisi samay ke saath parivartansheel chumbakeey kshetra ke kaaran yaa inamen se kisi do yaa adhik ke kaaran paidaa hota he
 Voltage unit voltage ise v se vyakt karte he
 v = w / q i
e
 w = work, q = charge chunki jab ham kisi bindu aavesh ko kisi duusare aavesh ke vaidyut kshetra main ek sthaan b se duusare sthaan a tak le jate he
 So we have to work against electrical force
 yahi kaary un donon sthanon ke bich vaidhut vibhavantar he
 Simar is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Chaukhutia tehsil
 nyaay darshan bharat ke chah vaidic darshanon main ek darshan he
 Its promoter is the sage Akshpad Gautama, whose Nyasutra is the most ancient and famous text of this philosophy
 jin sadhano se hamen gyey tattvon kaa gyaan praapt ho jaataa he, unheen sadhano ko ‘nyaay’ kii sangya di gai he
 Devraj defines 'justice' as saying- duusare shabdon main, jisaki sahaayta se kisi siddhanth par pahunchaa ja sake, use nyaay kehete hai
 It is justice to reach a decision based on the evidence
 yah mukhya rup se tarkshastra or gyanamimasaa he
 It is also referred to as Logic, Prostitution, Heterology, Philosophy and Inquisition
 vatsyayan ne pramanarthparikshann nyaayah kaa pareekshan hi nyaay he
 ) From this point of view, when a person establishes a theory in a subject, then the help of justice is required there
 isaliye nyaay-darshan vichaarsheel maanav samaaj kii moulik aavashyaktaa or udbhaavna he
 Without him, no man can refine and maintain his ideas and principles, nor can he protect his theory from the theoretical blows of the opponent
 nyaayashastra ucchkoti ke sanskrit sahitya kaa praveshdwar he
 It is difficult to understand any high Sanskrit literature without its preliminary knowledge, whether it is grammar, poetry, ornament, Ayurveda, scripture or philosophy
 darshan sahitya main to uske bina ek pag bhi chalanaa asambhav he
 Jurisprudence is literally a scripture that makes the intellect excellent, sharp and vivid
 parantu nyaayashastra jitna aavashyak or upyogi he utana hi kathin bhi, visheshtah navyanyay to maano durbodhata ko ekatra karke hi bana he
 Just like the Vaiseshika philosophy, justice is also shown in the judiciary by the knowledge of substances, the accomplishment of disarm
 nyaayadarshan main 16 padaarth maane gayi hai- The history of jurisprudence clearly begins with Gautama's 'nyasutra'
 pracheen granthon main is nyaayashastra ke katipay siddhanton kii charchaa to aaj bhi vishad rup se uplabdh he; parantu us pracheen tarkshastra kaa samyak evam sarvangpurn swaroop kya or kaisaa tha, iskaa sahi gyaan kisi ko nahin he
 It is mentioned in the cases of 'buddhist philosophy' that Buddhists used to represent their views against theistic principles
 isi kaa pratishedh karne hetu nyaayadarshan kii sanrachana hui
 The Buddha's time is believed to be in the sixth century BC
 yahi vah samay tha jab gautam ne nyaayashastra kii rachana kii
 One of the names of the judiciary is logic
 pracheen granth shastron main kinhin-kinhin sthanon main gautam tathaa kahin-kahin akshapaad ko nyaayadarshan kaa rachayita kaha gaya he
 It is mentioned in pages 11-20 under the role of the logic of Acharya Visvesvara
 umesh mishra dwaara rachit 'bhartiya darshan' main kaha gaya he ki tarkshastra baudhon ke pehle bhi tha or vah bada vyapak tha
 It has different ancient names
 yatha - anvikshiki, hetushastra, hetuvidya, tarkshastra, tarkvidya, vadavidya, pramanshastra, vakovakya, takki, vimansi aadi
 It is very difficult to decide when the judicial structure was formed
 kaaran ki vidwaanon ne i
pus
 chhathvin shatabdi se lekar isa purv paanchavi shatabdi ke bich apni manyatayen prastut kii hai; parantu sabake apane-apane paksh tarkyukt hai
 No definite decision can be reached from it
 nyaayashastra ke samgr vichaar do dhaaraon main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai - prameyapradhan or pramanpradhan
 The ideas of scholarly works from Gautama to the east of Gangesopadhyay are theorem and the ideas of Gangesopadhyay's Tattvacinthamani and subsequent scholarly works based on it are proof
 prameyapradhan vichaar vaale granthsamooh ko 'pracheen nyaay' tathaa pramanpradhan vichaarwaale granthsamooh ko 'navy nyaay' kaha jaataa he
 The language of ancient justice is simple and material interpretation, and the language of new justice is complex and substance interpretation is subtle
 nyayasutra ke pashchaat kaa jo sahitya uplabdh he, un sabamein vatsyayankrut ‘nyaaybhashya’ kaa pratham sthaan mana jaataa he
 a commentary on the judiciary, called 'judicial', has been written by 'udyotkar', in which the most usefulness of knowing the true nature of the theorems of jurisprudence exists
 inkaa kaal bhi isa kii paanchavin-chhathin shatabdi ke aasapaas hi he
 Even after the publication of the commentary called 'judicial' by Udyotkar did not stop the Buddhist shock on jurisprudence, due to which the eminent commentator Vachaspati Mishra had to write a commentary on the judiciary, which is a very important commentary known as 'judicialism'
 
 vidwaanon ne vachaspati mishra kaa samay isa kii naveen shatabdi maani he
 He purified and scripted this jurisprudence
 isi shuddhta ke kaaran hi aaj yah lekha-jokha uplabdh he ki nyaayadarshan main 5 adhyay tathaa 10 aahnik hai, 84 prakaran evam 528 sutara hai, 196 pad evam 8385 akshar hai
 In Indian philosophy, evidence is called that which helps in knowledge of truth, that is, the means or process by which there is a real knowledge of something else
 pramaan nyaay kaa mukhya vishay he
 The name 'prama' is of true knowledge
 yatharth gyaan kaa jo karan ho arthath jiske dwaara yatharth gyaan ho, use pramaan kehete hai
 These are the four proofs - direct, inference, subhuman and word - in the judiciary
 isamen aitihya, arthapatti, sambhav or abhaav ke pramantv kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 There are two distinctions of direct evidence - external and internal
 ghran, rasna, chakshu tvak or shroatra, in indriyon ko, sharir ke baahar upree bhaag main rahane ke kaaran tathaa bahari vishyon kaa graahak hone ke kaaran "bahya pratyaksh pramaan" or man ko sharir ke bheetar aatma ke saath rahane tathaa bhitari padaarth aatma evam athmiya gunon kaa graha hone ke kaaran "aantar pratyaksh pramaan" kaha jaataa he
 The direct words give sense to the three senses, sensory knowledge and their subject
 ye teen prakaar ke bodh nimnlikhit vyutpattiyon se kramash: utpann hote hai : With the number of direct evidence being six, the number of tajjanya knowledge is six and they are treated with names like idriadvaraka, such as ghrnaj, rasana, chakshu, tvach, shravan and manas, each of these direct knowledge has two distinctions
 - Alternative and optional
 nirviklpak- is pratyaksh main vastu ke swaroop maatr kaa bhaan hota he, uski vishaybhoot, main paraspar sambandh kaa maan nahin hota; atev is pratyaksh kii vishyata visheshantaa visheshyata or sansargata se vilakshan hoti he or vah vilakshan vishyata hi is pratyaksh kaa lakshan he
 It is imperceptible, ie it is not visible
 "saviklpak pratyaksh" ke kaaran rup main iskaa anumaan hota he
 Optional - This is a direct specific recipient
 isaki vishyata visheshantaa-prakaarta, visheshyata or sansargata ke bhed se teen prakaar kii hoti he
 It arises from "nirvikalak" and is directly attuned to the mind
 iske pratyaksh ko "anuvyavsaay" shabd se vyavahrut kiya jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of each of the alternative choices, the cosmic and the supernatural
 loukik - pratyaksh vartmaan or samipsth vastu kaa hi graahak hota he
 He is born from the cosmic contiguity of the senses with the object; They are six times in a row - coincidence, joint isom, joint isom, equal, isom, isom and is special
 inamen sanyog se dravya kaa, sanyuktasmavaay se dravya ke gun, karm or saamaanya kaa, sanyuktasmawet samavaay se gun or karm ke saamaanya kaa, samavaay se shabd kaa, samavet samavaay se shabd ke saamaanya kaa or visheshantaa se samavaay tathaa abhaav kaa pratyaksh hota he
 Supernatural - The supernatural also takes on direct distant and indistinct matter
 uskaa janm vishay ke saath indriya ke alokik sannikarsh se sampann hota he
 The supernatural approximations are three - generalism, knowledge and yoga
 saamanyalakshan - gyatsaamaanya yaa saamanyagyan ko saamanyalakshansannikarsh kaha jaataa he
 This makes it visible to all common types of proximal, remote, existing and non-existent
 yah pratyaksh usee dasha main hota he, jab saamaanya ke kisi aashray ke loukik pratyaksh kii saamagree sannihit rahati he
 Due to the glory of this contiguity, the knowledge of the prevalence of all the waves in all the dhooms is attained only by the associative knowledge of one single wave in a single dhoom and despite the determination of the prevalence of the wave in the adjacent dhoom, there would be suspicion of adultery in the non-destructive dhoom
 is
 gyanalakshan - tattad vishay kaa gyaan hi tattad vishay ke saath indriya kaa "gyanalakshan" sannikarsh kaha jaataa he
 With this contingency, the subject of knowledge is directly visible, not its shelter
 isi ke prabhaav se ek padaarth main anya padaarth ke dharm kaa bhramaatmak pratyaksh hota he
 Yogaj - a specific religion arises in the soul of man through yoga practice
 is dharm ko hi vishay ke saath indriya kaa yogaj sannikarsh kaha jaataa he
 This increases the power of the senses, as a result of which the senses are able to direct even remote and non-matter
 uske prabhaav se hi yogi ko sarvegyata kii prapti hoti he
 Continuous Direct - In this context, it is worth noting that in addition to the above mentioned personal directions, there is also a continuous, which is unborn and imperishable
 vah pratyaksh samgr sansar ko vishay karata he or upadanpratyaksh ke rup main sabhi kaaryon kaa kaaran hota he
 He remains united in the only God
 anumaan pramaan se un sabhi padaarthon kaa gyaan kiya jaataa he jo indriya dwaara gyaat hone kii yogyata rakhte hue bhi duurastha yaa avidhyman hone ke kaaran indriya se gyaat nahin hete athwa jisamen indriya se gyaat hone kii yogyata hi nahin hoti
 It has two distinctions - self-prediction and anticipation
 jis anumaan se apane sanshay kaa niraakaran yaa apane aap ko saadhy kaa nishchay hota he, use "swaarthanumaan" tathaa jis anumaan se anya vyakti - jigyaasu, prativaadee yaa madhyasth - ke sanshay kaa niraakaran yaa saadhy kaa nishchay hota he, use "pararthanumaan" kaha jaataa he
 The conclusion of the "self-prediction" is gained by knowing the prevalence of the objective in its own effort rather than the other man's word, and the "prediction" is derived from the word of the other man, ie, by the use of quasi-judicial justice
 is
 isiilie gangashopadhyaay ne tatvachintamani ke avyavprakaran main spasht kaha he- Justice - Its definition is given in the beginning
 nyaayashastra main iske paanch avyav maane gaye hai - pratigya, hetu, udhaaharan, upanay or giman
 The sentence with which the party has knowledge of the relationship with the practicable is called "pledge", the sentence which is aware of the meaning of the substantive in the subject, "for", the sentence from which the prevalence of the substantive is to be given as "example", the sentence from which In relation to the explanation for the argument in favor, it should be annihilated in relation to the meaning of the object in favor of "upay" and the sentence for which, showing the unobjectionable and unattractive
 Is called "incorporation"
 unke udhaaharan kram main is prakaar hai : Vatsyayan has called this Panchavayavakya sentence "ultimate justice"
 hetu, vyaptigyaan yaa vyapti gyanasahakrut man ko anumaan kah jaataa he
 Of these, the third party is very less famous but the first two sides are more famous
 udaynacharya tathaa unke anuyaayi "hetu" ko or gangashopadhyaay tathaa unke anuyaayi vyaptigyaan ko anumaan kehete hai
 In justice philosophy, three distinctions of presumption are given - antecedent, Seshavat and generalist
 vatsyayan ne in anumaanon kii nimnlikhit rup se do prakaar kii vyakhyaayein kii hai : 1
 Ante = = two objects together in a shelter, such as - Dhoom seen directly in the kitchen, and the estimate of the other being with the east, the estimate of the mountain movement in the atmosphere 2
 sheshwat = prasakt kaa pratishedh or anyatra prasakti ke abhaav se jaise- bhavatmak hone ke kaaran dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya shesh bachnewale padaarth kaa anumaan
 Prohibition of inflexion in karma and absence of affective word in the absence of affections of the word caste in particular and samayva, being in the normal, special and samyavah, being congregated in a mass in general and admiration
 Estimation of the word's inflexion in the remaining escapes attribute
 3
 saamanyatodrusht = jin do padaarthon main vyapyavyapak bhav sambandh jaise- ichha aadi gun or aatma kaa paraspar sambandh pratyaksh vidit na ho, kintu pratyaksh vidit sambandh jab pratyakshvidit nahin he, kintu saamaanya rup se vaale padaarthon kaa saamaanya saadrishy ho, unamem gun or dravya kaa sambandh pratyakshvidit he, ichha ek duusare kaa anumaan aadi main gun kaa evam aatma main dravyatv rup se anya dravya kaa saadrishy hone ke kaaran ichha aadi gunon se unke aashray rup main aatmaswaroop dravya kaa anumaan
 In the above three estimates, there are three distinctions of each - "kevalavayati", "kevalavityareki" and Anavayavittireki
 in bhedon kaa aadhaar raghunatha shiromani ne saadhy ko, udayanacharya ne vyaptigraahak sahachaar ko or gangashopadhyaay ne vyapti ko mana he
 Raghunath implies that the proviso that does not have an opposition is estimated to be a "justly committed" conjecture, such as the conjecture of universal religions such as speech, knowledge, etc
; And the proviso that is not evident is called the "only individual" estimate, such as the estimate of the separation of the earth from the smell; And the approximation of the proviso, which has both the opposite and the opposition, is called the "anvayavityereki" conjecture, such as the conjecture of the revolution
 udaynacharya kaa aashay yah he ki "anvayasahachaar" = hetu main saadhy kaa sahachaar or "vyatireksahachaar" = saadhyabhaav main hetvbhaav kaa sahachaar, in donon sahachaaron se anvayavyapti kaa hi gyaan hota he or usee se anumiti hoti he, at: jis anumiti ke utpaadak vyaptigyaan kaa udai keval anvayasahachaar ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "kevalanwai" anumaan, evam jis anumiti ke utpaadak vyaptigyaan kaa janm keval vyatireksahachaar se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "keval vyatireki" tathaa jis anumiti ke utpaadak vyaptigyaan kaa udai anvayasahachaar or vyatirek sahachaar donon ke gyaan se hota he us anumiti kaa kaaran "anvayavyatireki" anumaan kaha jaataa he
 Gangeshopadhyay implies that permission does not originate only from inquisitorial knowledge, but also from heteronomy, so the permission of the permission which is born only by inquisition is "only", and the permission of which permissibility is born only of intertextuality
 The reason for the permission is due to knowledge "only" and the permission of birth is both unknown and perverse
 The reason for this permission is due to the knowledge of occupants is called "anvayavitireki" inference
 jis padaarth main saadhy kii vyapti or pakshadharmata ke gyaan se anumiti kii utpatti hoti he use "hetu" yaa ling kaha jaataa he
 He has two distinctions - "saddhetu" and Hetabhasa
 saddhetu main nimnlikhit paanch rup avashya hone chahie : Here, the completion of the above five forms is necessary only for the Siddhetu of the Enlightenment
 kevalanwai saddhetu ke liye "vipakshsatv" se atirikt chaar roopon se hi sampann hona apekshit hota he
 The fallacy - the knowledge of which is allowed by the restriction of the consequent philosophy or dogmatism - is called "hetbash" - in the sense of causal defect and the causes in which these faults occur - "in the sense of evil" - "hetbash" is
 hetugat dosha ke paanch bhed maane jate hai
 From the following table it can be understood who those distinctions are, what is committed by them, and what are the names of the evil men with them? anumiti ke kaaran - ling - hetu kaa trividh paraamarsh anumiti kaa kaaran hota he
 "knowledge of relation for favor" is called first gender counseling - such as "mountain fumigation" This kind of knowledge of the relation of Dhoom in the mountain
 "hetu main saadhy kii vyapti kaa gyaan" dwitiya ling paraamarsh kaha jaataa he - jaise dhooma main, vahrivyapti kaa "dhoomo vahri vyapya:" is prakaar kaa gyaan
 The knowledge of the relation of the subject in favor is called "third or extreme gender counseling" - such as the knowledge of the relation of the "dhoomya Vyaprayya Dhoomu" of the relation of Dhoomya Vyapya in the mountain
 pakshata - "pakshata" bhi anumiti kaa ek kaaran he
 This is considered to be the reason for permission to prevent the origin of permission in the event that the provable is decided in favor
 chir pracheen naiyayikon ne "sadhysanshay" ko, udaynacharya ne "anumiti vishyak ichha" ko, pakshdhar mishra ne anumitijanak ichha ke rup main "anumaata kii anumiti - ichha" ko tathaa uske abhaav main "ishwar kii ichha" ko or gangashopadhyaay ne "sishadhyishavirahavishishtsiddhyabhaav" ko "pakshata" mana he
 The intention of Gangesopadhyay is that permission is not generated at the same time when there is a proven accomplishment on the side and there is no desire to know that goal by inference; But if there is a desire to know the meaning by inference, permission also arises in the case of provability in favor
 uske liye sadhysanshay yaa anumitata kii niyat apeksha nahin hoti
 Restrictions - This is also the reason for permission
 ise nimnlikhit talika ke anusaar chaar rup main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Permission is prohibited by these four decisions; Therefore, the absence of these four determinations leads to permission in the form of "restriction"
 vyapti - vyapti gyaan ko dwitiya lingaparamarsh ke rup main anumiti kaa kaaran kaha gaya he
 In the interpretation of this coverage, the Nyayikas have displayed great effort; Because this is the cornerstone of the proof of inference
 vyapti mukhya rup se do prakaar kii maani gai he - "anvayavyapti" or "vyatirekvyapti"
 The extent to which the body - the comprehensiveness for the purpose - is penetrated is called the Siddhantabhaita Anvayyapati - such as "for the universal comprehension
 or jis vyapti ke sharir main - hetvbhaav main saadhyabhavvyaapakatv- kaa pravesh ho use "vyatirekvyapti" kaha jaataa hai - saadhyabhavvyapakabhav pratiyogitv"
 Exploitation means that for the sake of being in the shelter of such a cause, which is not lacking in any shelter
 or vyatirekvyapti kaa taatpary yah he ki saadhyabhaav ke aashrayon main hetvbhaav kaa hona
 For example, due to absence of any shelter in the comet, it is widespread in the sky and there is a spurt in the shelter of that planet; Similarly, there is a lack of dhoom in the shelters of Vahnibhava; Hence, both the "anvay" and "vyatarek" of Vahni remain in Dhoom
 vyaptigyaan ke upaay - vyatigyaan ke teen sadhak maane jate hai- "vyabhichaar kaa agyaan," "hetu main sadhyasahachaar yaa saadhyabhaav main hetvabhavsahachaar" kaa gyaan or "tark"
 The first two of these are universal means of philosophy; But logic is not always expected
 jaisaa ki vishwanath ne apane bhashaa pariched naamak granth ke gun prakaran main kaha he : Logic - Gautam has said the characteristics of logic: 
 Subsequent Navya Nyayikas have characterized the argument as follows: "the dietary accusation of the wider than the dietary charge of the practitioner" is "logic"
 is tark kaa vipareet anumaan main arthath vyapak u apadya ke abhaav se vyapya u aapadak ke abhaav ke anumaan main paryavasann hona isaki shuddhta kaa nikash mana jaataa he
 Whenever the suspicion of practicable adultery starts to ban the prevalence of knowledge, that doubt is nullified by logic and paves the path of prevalence
 jaise-pakgrihagat dhooma main pagrihagat vahri ke sahachaar kaa gyaan hone par bhi jab parvatiy dhooma main vahrivyabhichaar kii shankaa hoti he, use dur karne ke liye "tark" kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Eg - "in any Dhoom, when the adultery is committed, it will not be the cause of the Dhoom and it is not possible that the Dahiri should not be considered as the cause of Dhoom; because in that case the fixed tendency of man in the eclipse of Dhoom for editing Dhoom
 Will be omitted "
 is tark ke falswaroop yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki "dhooma vahri se utpann hota he at: usamen vahrivyabhichaar kaa abhaav he" or is nishkarsh ke nishpann hote hi parvatiy dhooma main vahrivyabhichaar kii shankaa nivrutt ho jane se dhooma main vahrivyapti kaa gyaan nirbaadh rup se sampann ho jaataa he
 The example of the above argumentative formula depicts the soul of logic, interdependence, chakraka, non-existence of the logic and the different hindrances of the four, each illustrating these five distinctions
 oopaadhi - jo padaarth ke sab aashrayon main rahata ho par hetu ke sab aashrayon main na rahata ho, "oopaadhi" kaha jaataa he
 There are three distinctions of the title - broad of pure practicable, broad of unambiguous provable and broad of mean provable
 oopaadhi kaa gyaan vyaptigyaan kaa sidhaa virdohi nahin hota he
 That is, the adulteration of a broad degree practicable in the forwards causes him to experience practicable adultery, and that presumptive adultery of the practicum leads to an explicit restriction of prevalence
 ek padaarth main anya padaarth ke saadrishygyan "upmaan" pramaan kaha jaataa he
 This gives the knowledge of the power relation of a particular word in the meaning
 uski prakriya is prakaar he
 When an Aranya resident tells a villager that there is an animal named Gaavya like your cow in the Aranya, when you go to the Aranya, then the animal whom you see as your cow, should consider it as a village, accordingly when the villager will ever find the Aranya Goes and sees an animal similar to his cow there, he remembers the Aranavasi and he consequently decides the power connection of the song in that animal
 Is
 is prakaar gavay main gosaadrishy kaa darshan upmankraman, aranyavasi ke dwaara updisht arth kaa samaran uskaa vyapaar tathaa gavay main gavay shabd kii shakti kaa nishchay upamiti naamak fal kaha jaataa he
 Udayanacharya has said the same thing in advance
 vishwanath nyaayapanchanan kii agrim karikaon main yah vishay or bhi vishad he : See also - proof jisamen padaarth ke shakti yaa lakshan sambandh ke gyaan se padaarth kaa samaran hokar padaarth kaa anubhav hota he, use "shabd pramaan" kaha jaataa he
 The word Ghat and Ganga are proof in the meaning of Ghat and Gangatiar in the form of Ghat and the meaning of Gangatiar with the knowledge of Ghatpartha in the word Ghata, the experience of Ghata with the knowledge of Ghatapartha and the experience of Ghatatiar in Ganga word
 
 amuk shabd amuk arth kaa bodhak ho, athwa amuk arth amuk shabd se bodhit ho, is prakaar ke anadi ishwar-sanket ko shakti kaha jaataa he
 Just as King Bhagiratha created milk from the curse of Kapil Muni and for the salvation of his ancestral essence, the waterflood that was introduced to the earth, the infinite sign of the Ganges in that deluge is the power of the word Ganga in that sense

 Such as the coincident relationship of the word waterflow with the arrow
 jab kisi shabd se shakti dwaara vaktaa ke abhimath arth kii pratiti nahin ho paati us shabd se lakshan dwaara us arth kii pratiti sampann ho jaati he
 According to jurisprudence, the strength and characteristics of meaning are dependent on pure words of Sanskrit language, words of other languages are considered abusive or abusive in terms of jurisprudence
 apbhransh shabd se arth kii pratiti hoti he jab usamen arth kii paribhaasha kii gai hoti he yaa usamen arth kaa shaktibhram hota he
 Apart from power and character, no semantic relation to the name vyjana is valid in jurisprudence
 jis arth ke avabodh ke liye aise tisare sambandh kii aavashyaktaa samajhi jaati he, uskaa bodh kahin lakshana se, kahin gyaan lakshan sannikarsh ke dwaara man se or kahin anumaan se hi sampann ho jaataa he
 The word proof has two distinctions - cosmic and Vedic
