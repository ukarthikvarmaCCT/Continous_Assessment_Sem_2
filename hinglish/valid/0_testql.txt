 The functions and services of the bank can be divided into four categories: raashi jamaa karne main bank praaia: teen prakaar ke lekhe kholte hai : chal lekhe, sthir lekhe, bachat lekhe
 Bank deposits have to be paid at any time on the demand of the depositor
 at: ise bank kii 'maang dendaree' bhi kehete hai
 Fixed accounts are credited for a fixed period which cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the period
 yadi koi jamakarta sthir lekhe main jamaa apni raashi ko avadhi purna hone se purv nikaalnaa chaahe to use raashi par byaaj nahin miltaa
 This type of deposit is called 'call liability'
 tisare prakaar kii jamaa bachat lekhe main kii jaati he
 No amount can be deposited beyond the limit prescribed in Savings Account is prakaar ke lekhe kam ywaale logon kii bachat ko protsaahan dene ke liye khole jate hai
 Sometimes special types of accounts are also opened for special works
 udaahranarth, vivaah ke liye dhanrashi sangrah ke hetu vivaah lekha, shiksha ke liye raashi sangrah karne ke hetu shiksha lekha aadi
 Loans and advances are given by the bank in several forms: bank apane graahakon or anya vishwasaneey vyaktiyon tathaa sansthaaon ko keval vyavsaay evam utpaadan sambandhi kaaryon ke liye rin dete hai
 While giving loan, banks open an article in the name of the borrower and deposit the loan amount in it, due to which the borrower keeps writing the amount from time to time by writing the check as per the requirement
 isse bank ko sakal rinrashi ek saath hi rinayachak ko de dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti jisase bank kaa hanibhay kam ho jaataa he
 Loans are sanctioned against personal credit and security of goods
 adhivikarsh dwaara rin dene se bank apane jamakarta ko uske chal tathaa bachat lekhon main jamaa raashi se adhik raashi nikaalane kaa adhikaar de detaa he
 But before obtaining such a right, the customer has to enter into a definite agreement with his bank on the amount of overdraft, its duration, rate of interest, etc
 bank vyavsaayik maal kii jamaanat par tathaa pranapatron or saakhapatron kii saakh par bhi rin dete hai
 Loans are given against the security of goods by keeping them in their godowns or by locking themselves in merchants' warehouses
 par is prakaar rin dene se pehle bank maal ke vaastavik mulya par chhot laga lete hai
 Loans can also be obtained from the bank through deduction of bills
 koi bhi malvikreta apane kharidaar ke naam vinimay bill likhakar usapar uski sweekruti praapt karke kisi bank se us sweekrut bill kii katautee kara letaa he
 On deducting, the bank deducts its commission and pays the balance of the bill to the bill holder and then at the end of the bill period, it gets the full amount from the acceptor of the bill
 is prakaar diya gaya rin praaia: alpakaaleen hota he
 The bank also performs agency work for its customers
 agency sambandhi kriyaayein is prakaar hai : graahakon ke liye bilon, chekon tathaa pranapatron kii raashi vasuul tathaa unki ore se chukaaye janevaale bilon, chekon tath pranapatron kaa bhugtan karnaa, kisi vyakti athwa sanstha ko niyamit rup se ek nishchit raashi bhugtana, beemaa companiyon ko pravyaji kii raashi chukaana, sarkaar kaa graahakon kii ore se iskar chukaana tathaa unki ore se malgujari chukaane kii vyavastha karnaa, company ke anshon par labhaansh tathaa rinpatron par byaaj vasuul karnaa or sarkari sicuritiyon kaa kray-vikray karnaa tathaa unke salaahkaar or pratinidhi kii haisiyat se kaam karnaa
 In banking practice, the relationship between bank and customer can often be expressed in three ways: jab bank main graahak kii raashi jamaa ho, jiskaa bhugtan bank ko graahak ke maangane par karnaa pade to bank graahak kaa dendar ore graahak bank kaa lender hota he
 But sometimes this relationship also turns the opposite
 jab graahak bank se rin le athwa apane lekhe main jamaa raashi se adhik raashi nikaale to bank graahak kaa lender or graahak uskaa dendar ban jaataa he
 In normal practice, the debtor is required to return the amount paid after the expiry of the loan, irrespective of whether the demand is from the creditor or not
 par bank ek aisa dendar hota he jo apane paas jamaa kii hui raashi ko graahak ke maangane par hi lautaata he, anyathaa nahin
 But if the customer is the debtor of the bank, then he has to pay the loan on the demand of the bank after the end of the period and not even after it is asked
 bank dwaara jamaa rup main liye hue rinon ke saath anya saamaanya rinon kii bhanti 'kaal maryaada niyam' lagu nahin hota
 The amount can remain in the customer's account for how long
 bank ek hi graahak ke vibhinn lekhon ko ekatra maanakar apana rin vasuul kar saktaa he par graahak bank main apane vibhinn lekhon ko ekatra maanakar raashi bhugtan karne ke liye bank ko vivash nahin kar saktaa
 The bank receives a title lien from the customer on the amount or securities in the normal transaction
 bank ko graahak kii un sicuritiyon par, raashi par tathaa vastuon par grahanadhikaar praapt hota he jo uske paas kisi vishisht uddeshy ke hetu na ai hon varan banking lenden ke saamaanya kram main praapt hui hon
 The bank can recover its loan if the customer does not repay the loan by selling the goods under the lien
 jis samay bank apane graahak ke aadesh se uske lekhe par sicuritiyon kaa kray vikray karata he, uske lekhe par iskar, bhoomikar, beemaa kii prakhyaji kaa, chanda aadi kii raashi kaa bhugtan karata he to us sthiti main bank graahak ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaam karata he
 As long as the customer's heritage remains with the bank, the bank is called the customer's trustee and the customer's bank's candidate
 pratyaashee ke rup main kaam karte hue bank ko apane pratyaashee ke dwaara jamaa kii hui vastuon ko badi saavdhaanee or suraksha ke saath rakhana aavashyak hota he
 Banks charge some fees from customers for this service
 bank mulat: saakh kaa lenden karte hai-saakh par janata se unki atirek bachat raashi jamaa lete or us jamaa raashi ko anya rinyaachakon ko rin rup main udhaar dete hai
 Thus, in the course of transaction of funds, banks create credit and are called creators of credit
 saakh kii srujankriya main jamaa, katautee tathaa nirgaman ye teen kaary sannihit hote hai
 When a bank approves a loan to a person or an institution, it usually does not provide the loan amount in cash at the same time, but opens and deposits the loan account of the person asking for the loan and the borrower is empowered to make the check as per his requirement
 Continue to withdraw money by writing
 is prakaar ek ore rin sweekrut kiya jaataa he to duusari ore usee rin kii raashi se jamaa bana lee jaati he
 Thus, debt gives rise to deposits
 jab bank apni jamaa raashi main se graahakon ko rin detaa he to us samay jamaa rin kii janmdatri hoti he or jab bank rin sweekrut karne main jamaa kaa nirmaan karte hai, to us samay rin jamaa ke janmdata ban jate hai
 The third method of credit creation is through banknote issuance
 par yah adhikaar keval desh ke kendriya bank ko hi mila hota he
 Each bank is independent in its credit creation policy, even if it has to keep its own credit-building capacity, the cash fund held by central banks, the fund of banks deposited with central banks, metallurgical funds deposited with banks, credit of credit petitioners and The general economic and political situation of the country has to be taken care of
 janata se dhan raashi jamaa karaane main bank do prakaar kaa daayitv apane upar letaa he- maang dendaree, kaal dendaree
 Demand dues are to be paid by the bank at any time on the statutory demand of the depositors and the term dues are usually paid at the end of the specified period
 aisi sthiti main bank apane paas jamaa kul raashi ko rin yaachakon ko udhaar nahin de saktaa kyonki use yah bhay rahata he ki na maaloom kab jamakarta maang karke apni raashi lene aa jaae
 Therefore, before lending, the bank keeps some cash in the fund with it, so that it can meet the demand of the depositors from time to time
 yah raashi bank kaa nakad kosh kehalaata he
 Some banks also keep cash funds with them and deposit them with the central bank so that they can meet the demand of the depositors by giving the amount from there
 nakad kosh bank kii saakh banaae rakhane main sahaayak hota he
 Cash fund is said to be the 'first line of defense' of the bank
 kisi bhi samay nakad kosh kii raashi nimna paristhitiyon par nirbhar hoti he : Statutory decisions, average deposits of depositors, banking habits and tendencies of the people, general nature of customers, local customs and circumstances, arrangement of Mundramandi business conditions or facilities of clearing house in the country
 ukt paristhitiyon ke atirikt nakad kosh kii maatra bank adhikariyon ke purv anubhav, unki doordarshita tathaa us desh kii vyapaarik sthiti par nirbhar hoti he
 The bank receives the interest it receives from the depositors by lending them to others
 is byaaj kii raashi main se kuch bhaag vah jamakartaon ko unki jamaa raashi par byaaj swaroop dekar shesh raashi vah apane paas bachaa letaa he
 The bank is required to carefully appropriate the remaining amount by keeping some part of its gross deposits as cash funds
 bank kii viniyog niti bhinn bhinn deshon main, bhinn bhinn avasaron par or vibhinn bainkon ke saath bhinn bhinn hoti he
 It is necessary for each bank to consider several factors while setting its investment policy
 bank kii raashi kaa viniyog is prakaar ho ki aavashyaktaa hone par use rokad raashi main badalawaaya ja sake, viniojit mooldhan surakshit rahe, viniogon se santoshjanak aay bhi mili, dhanrashi kaa viniyog kisi ek hi udyog vyapaar main na kiya jaae, bank kii raashi kisi vyaktivishesh ko hi rin ke rup main na di jaae, jamaanton kaa bhalee bhanti nirikshan kar liya jaae, jamaanat, jisapar raashi viniojit kii ja rahi he, taral, surakshit or laabhprad ho or yadi kabhi kisi jamaanat main mulya kaa hraas hone lage to rini se turant anya jamaanat lekar us hraas kaa puraa kiya ja sake
 Normally, banks appropriate their funds in two ways: by purchasing items like geodesy, furniture etc
 for conducting business
 isse bank ko koi aay nahin milti
 By giving short term loans, cutting bills and buying and selling securities
 inase bank ko aay hoti or laabh miltaa he
 To make a profit, banks appropriate their funds by giving short-term loans, purchasing and cutting bills, purchasing appropriations and other securities, or accepting loans and advances
 bank dwaara maanya jamaantein achal sampati se sambhddha athwa vaiyaktik ho sakati hai
 The collateral security may be in the form of a charter in respect of goods or goods in addition to the personal credit of the person taking the loan
 isamen saamanyat: teen adhikaar hote hai- swatv grahanadhikaar, praadhi or bandhak
 Under the lien, the bank reserves the right to retain the security held by the borrower if the borrower does not pay the loan
 bank ko is jamaanat ko bechney kaa adhikaar nahin hota or yadi vah aisa karnaa hi chaahe to use nyaayalay se tatsambandhi ajna praapt karnaa aavashyak hota he

 All of Western Europe was religious in the early 16th century - all were Christians; All were members of the Roman Catholic Church; He believed in his traditional education and accepted his rule in religious matters, namely the rule of the Pope of Rome
 europea dharmasudhar athwa riformation 16veen shatabdi ke us mahaan andolan ko kehete hai jiske falswaroop paashchaatya isaayiyon kii yah ekta chhin-bhinn hui or protestant dharm kaa udai hua
 Reformist movements continued from time to time in the history of the church, but they did not challenge the religious principles of the church or its rulers, according to their instructions, to eliminate moral evils and promote religious education as their objective
 16veen shatabdi main jo sudhaar kaa andolan pravartit hua vah sheeghra hi carch kii paramparaagat shiksha or uske shaskaon ke adhikaar, donon kaa virodh karne laga
 As a result of the Reformation movement, Catholicism as well as Luther sect, Calvin sect, Anglican sect and Presbyterian sect became prevalent in Europe
 dharmasudhar kaa yah naveen swaroop samajhane ke liye europe kii tatkaaleen paristhiti par vichaar karnaa atyant aavashyak he
 The sense of reverence that Christians have had for centuries for the Catholic Church promoted by Christ had been reduced for several reasons
 14veen shatabdi main ek francisi pope kaa chunaav hua tha, jo jivan bhar france main hi rahe
 As a result, for 40 years later two pope existed, one in France and one in Rome, dividing the entire Catholic world into two parts
 aathvin shatabdi main frank jati ke katholic raja ne italy par akraman karne vaali lonward sena ko haraakar italy kaa madhya bhaag pope ke adhikaar main de diya or is prakaar roman katholic carch ke parmadhikari dharmaguru ke atirikt ek saadhaaran shaasha bhi ban gaye
 For this reason, the kings of Germany and France instinctively tried to interfere in the affairs of the Church and especially in the election of the Pope
 14veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main yah chunaav italy ke abhijaat varg kii pratiyogita kaa maidan ban gaya tha jisase vyakti kii yogyata par kam, uske vansh par adhik dhyaan diya jane laga
 As a result, at that time, extremely inept pope was elected and morality and religion began to be neglected in the court of Rome
 at: rome ke carch ke prati shraddha kaa ghat janaa nitant swaabhaavik tha
 Another reason for dissatisfaction was that the institutions of the entire church were taxed according to their property and the representatives of Rome always wandered and collected this money
 carch ke kendriya sanghathan kii is durdasha ke atirikt vibhinn dharmapraanton kii paristhiti bhi santoshjanak nahin thi
 At this time, all of Western Europe was divided into about seven hundred religions
 unke shaasha bishap kehalaate the
 These bishops were feudatories who were often elected by the king from among the aristocracy, were members of the court, and were often the political rulers of their region in Germany
 at: bahut se bishap raajnneeti main adhik, dharm main kam ruchi lete the or apane dharmpradesh kaa dharmik prashasan vishvavidhyalay ke ucch adhikaar praapt purohiton ke haath main chhod dete the
 Most of the ordinary priestly settlers in the villages were semi-educated
 pravachan dene main asamarth the or praaia: garib bhi the
 This pathetic condition of ordinary priests was the biggest weakness of the 16th century European Catholic Church
 bhraman karanevaale francisco aadi dharmasandhiyon ke atirikt jansadharan ko dharmik shiksha denevaala koi nahin tha
 Due to this, superstition was spread everywhere and rituals were given unnecessary and unbalanced importance
 13veen shatabdi main katholic dharmavigyaan ne arestu kii isai vyakhya tathaa scholastic philosophy ke sahare dharmasiddhanton kaa yuktiyukt pratipaadan kiya tha kintu 15veen shatabdi main dharm kii moolbhoot samasyaon par se dhyaan or chintan hat gaya tha
 In universities, piety had begun to give greater importance to their differences in the subject of secondary questions, which led to the devotion of Catholic theology so much that some believers became convinced that theology was an impediment to spiritual practice
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki carch ke sabhi kshetron main sudhaar kii apeksha thi or dharmasudhar kaa andolan anivaary ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, Angrez Wickliffe and later Bohimiya's Huss Jo started teaching that the organization of the church, its rites, etc
 are all inventions of humans; The Bible is sufficient for Christians
 us samay bhi un vichaaron ko adhik safalataa nahin mili kintu unka luther par prabhaav spasht hi he
 In Spain, Arbishop Simnes of Toledo introduced the Reforms movement within the discipline of the Church, which completely changed the atmosphere there, but there was no significant change in the Church's situation in Western Europe
 jab luther ne rome ke viruddh aawaaj uthaai unako ek or kaaran se apurv safalataa mili
 Along with the popularity of ancient Greek and Latin literature everywhere in Europe at that time, a new cultural movement started called Renaissance or Renaissance
 iske falswaroop logon main vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa bhav utpann hua
 Since the invention of printing, printed copies of the Bible were becoming more easily accessible from this time onwards, encouraging people to think about religion on their own and also the tendency to interpret the Bible as their own
 europea dharmasudhar kaa aitihaasik vikaas is prakaar he : iskaa aarambh 1517 i
 main luther ke vidroh se hua tha
 The circumstances under which he had started his movement and how he had started a new religion by opposing the traditional doctrines of the Church are described elsewhere in the encyclopedia
 us samay samast germany lagbhag chaar sau swatantraroop rajyon main vibhakt tha
 Most of their rulers protected Luther in opposition to the Catholic emperor Charles and merged his subjects into the Church of Luther
 sheeghra hi scandinavia ke samast isai bhi lutheran dharm main sammilit hue
 In Switzerland, the two leaders of the Reformation were the most prominent - the Gingli in Zurich and the Calvin in Geneva, both of whom later became followers of the same Calvinist church
 yah sampradaay holland, scotland tathaa france ke kuch bhaagon main bhi fail gaya
 In Scotland, it is named Presbyterian Religion
 In France, Luther first influenced but later most of the Protestant religious, called Eugenie, became followers of Calvin
 unka sanghathan ek raajnneetik dal ke rup main se bahut samay tak sakriy rahaa 
 The King of England had opposed Luther from the beginning
 unhone ek granth bhi likhaa tha jisamen unhone dharm ke maamalon main pope ke ishwardutt adhikaar kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Although Henry tried to stop propagating Protestant doctrines throughout his kingdom, he separated the Church of England from Rome in 1531 AD for personal reasons, thus the Anglican community was started
 henry ke uttaradhikariyon ke samay main us carch par protestant vichaardhaara kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa jisase aajkal vah protestant dharm kii teen pramukh shakhaon main se ek mana jaataa he kintu vastav main anglican samudaay kii utpatti, vikaas or prachaar kaa apana alag itihaas he 
 Apart from these three sects, the religion reform movement led to the emergence of many more Protestant religions which are unnecessary to mention here
 apekshaakrit adhik mahatv rakhanevaale sampradaayon kaa kinchit vivaran kosh main anyatra diya gaya he 
 It is clear from this overview that the reform movement, promoted by Luther, took various forms and shook all of Europe
 pranrabh main carch kaa sudhaar is andolan kaa uddeshy tha kintu vah sheeghra hi carch kii paramparaagat shiksha tathaa carch kii sanghathanaatmak ekta par prahaar karne laga
 The result of this is that the unity of the Christians of Europe has been severed for centuries
 shashan kii drushti se purna rup se swatantra sampradaayon kaa udbhav hua, jo ek hi isa or bible ko maanate hue bhi anek moolbhoot dharm siddhanton ke vishay main bhinn bhinn maton kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 From the political point of view, the result of the reform was very widespread
 europe kii uttaramadhyakaalin paristhiti aisi thi ki shaskaon ne bhi anivaary rup se is dharmik andolan main sakriy bhaag liya he
 They agreed to wage war with the aim of incorporating or retaining their subjects in their own religion
 is prakaar europe ke itihaas main dharm ke naam par anek yudhon kii charchaa he, jaise, germany main 30 varshiya yuddh france main yugano yuddh or holland main samrat charles pancham ke viruddh safal swatantraaa sangram
 It has been mentioned above that reform movements have been in place in the Catholic Church from time to time, but the Catholic Church was particularly inspired by the 16th century rebellious reform
 is shatabdi main pope ke rup main pratibhashali vyaktiyon kaa chunaav hua jinhone carch ke shashan main phir aadhyatm ko praathamikta dilaa di he jisase samast katholic sansar main pope kaa pad pun: purnroopen sammanit ho sakaa
 The feudalism of the bishops was abolished and the appointment of four more saintly persons led to the emergence of the ancient ideal of the bishop, who is the spiritual leader and spiritual shepherd of his subjects
 trent naamak nagar main carch kii 19veen vishwasabha kaa aayojan hua jisamen carch ke nae sanghathan ke atirikt vishesh rup main saadhaaran purohiton ke shikshan kaa prabandh kiya gaya
 Therefore, all the categories of the Church were reformed and religious education could be properly promoted among the masses
 is kaary main dharmasandhiyon ne duusare purohiton kaa haath bantaya he
 In the 16th century, many religious associations like the Jesuits were established and reforms were done in the ancient religions so that they could serve the religion according to the needs of all time
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki dharm sudhaar kaa sambhavat: sabase gaharaa evam hitkari prabhaav puraane kathilak carch par hi padaa
 Seeing the wide spread and deep impact of the reform of European religion, a question arises in our mind that what is the secret of this unprecedented success
 is safalataa ke anek kaarnon kii kalpana kii gai he : The pathetic condition of the Catholic Church in the early 15th century and the inaction of its masters, the aid of politicians eager to seize the property of the Church, the movement of personal freedom due to the Renaissance, new features of propaganda from the invention of printing
 yah sab aalochay andolan ke liye sahaayak siddh hua kintu isaki safalataa kaa rahasy anyatra dhoondhna chahie
 The promoters of Dharmasudhara were inspired by the sattvic and religious sentiments and were able to inculcate the ardent desire for religious renaissance among their talented colleagues
 inke vichaar main us navajagaran kaa ekmaatr upaay yah prathit hota tha ki manushya apane punya karmon par bharosa na rakhkar isa ke prati aatmasamarpan kare or bible main surakshit isa ke susamachar par vishwaas kare
 They made the Bible the basis of their movement, they have succeeded by the power contained in the Bible
 aajkal isai sansar main 16veen shatabdi kii ghatnaon par tatasth drushti se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Kathilak acknowledges the creative achievements of European Reformation and Protestants are beginning to understand that no matter how necessary it was to resist the then evils of the Church, Christianity has been greatly damaged by the disintegration of its unity
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke baad isai ekta ke andolan ko atyadhik mahatv diya jane laga he or dharmasudhar ke dushprinaam ko dur karne kii abhilaashaa badhati ja rahi he
 Former reformers of Martin Luther raised their voice against the immorality, corruption, luxury, and exploitation of the Church and the papacy from the fourteenth century onwards and they set the background for religious reform

 jo upkaran adhimishran ko anjaam detaa he modulator kehalaata he or jo upkaran vipareet kriya karata he demodulator kehalaata he
 The device that can do both types of tasks is called a modem
 ankiy adhimishran kaa uddeshy ankiy bit stream ko ek anuroop pasband channel main sthaanantaran karnaa he, udhaahranswaroop; saarvajanik switchd telephone network,, yaa ek simit radio frequency band par sthaanantaran karnaa he
 The purpose of analog modulation is to transfer an analog baseband signal, for example to transfer an audio signal or TV signal to an analog passband channel, another example is to limit the radio frequency band or cable TV network channel
 anuroop or ankiy adhimishran frequency divijan multiplexing, ko aasaan banaata he, jabaki isi ke saath kai lo-paas soochna sanket kaa sthaanantaran ek saajhe bhautik madhyam se alag pasband channelon kaa upyog kar ke jariye hota he
 Digital baseband modulation systems, also called line coding, also aim to transfer a baseband channel over a digital bit stream via a serial bus or wire-connected local area network such as a non-filter-copper wire
 pulse adhimishran pranali kaa uddeshy ek nairoband anuroop sanket ko sthaanantarit karnaa he, udhaahranswarup phone kol kaa wideband besaband channel par aana, yaa kuch yojanaon main beet stream kaa ek duusare ankiy transmishan system main aana
 In analog modulation, the modulation on the analog information signal is continuous
 saamaanya anuroop adhimishran takanic nimna prakaar ke hote hai : In digital modulation, the analog carrier signal is modulated by a digital bit flow
 ankiy adhimishran paddati main ankiy se anuroop roopantaran ho saktaa he or demodyulation yaa ditection main anuroop se ankiy main roopantaran ho saktaa he
 Changes in the carrier signal are chosen from a finite number of m option symbols
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan : ek telephone line ko shravan yogya dhwani ko sthanantarit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye ek tone ko len, yah ankiy bits nahin he
 This is why computers can connect to the telephone via modems, which represent digital bits by tones, called symbols
 agar vahaan chaar vikalp ke pratik hai, pehla pratik bit seqvence 00 kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, isi tarah doosraa 01 ko, teesraa 10 or chauthaa 11
 agar kisi modem main 1000 tone prati second vaala sangeet bajataa he, to iskaa pratik dar 1000 pratik / prati second, yaa bod hoga
 chunki is udhaaharan main harek tone do ankiy bits vaala ek massej kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, isliye bit dar pratik dar kaa duguna yani 2000 bits prati second hota he
 According to one definition of a digital signal, the modulated signal is a digital signal, but in another definition, modulation is also called the conversion from digital to analog
 zyaadaatar pathyapustakon main ankiy adhimishran skim ko ankiy transmishan ke rup main, data transmishan kaa hi paryaay maan liya gaya he, bahut kam pathyapustakon main ise anuroop transmishan kaha gaya he
 The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are as follows: QAM main, ek infez sanket or ek kshetrakalan charan aayam ek parimit sankhya main abhivyakt hoti he
 This can be seen as a two-channel system, with each channel using ASK
 parinamswaroop sanket PSK or ASK donon ke sammishran ke baraabar hota he
 In each of the above methods, each phase, frequency or amplitude is dictated by an amazing double beats pattern
 aamtaur par, harek charan frequency yaa aayam kii saamaan sankhya ke beats kaa kutalekhan karti he
 The symbol included in this number of bits is represented by a particular phase
 yadi varnmaala main m = 2 n { \ displaystyle M=2^{N}} vaikalpik pratik ke rup main shaamil he to harek pratik n bits ke sandesh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If the symbol rate f s { \ displaystyle f_ {S}} is the symbol per second, the data rate is n f s { \ displaystyle Nf_ {S}} beats per second
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek varnmaala jisame 16 vaikalpik pratik hai, harek pratik 4 bits kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Therefore the data rate will be four times the baud rate
 PSK, ASK yaa QAM, jahaan adhimishrit sanket kii carrier frequency sthir he vahaan adhimishran varnmaala aksar aasaani se raashi rekhachitr kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, harek sanket ke liye aayam ke i sanket ko x-axis or q sanket ko y-axis dwaara darshata he
 PSK and ASK using the principle of QAM, but sometimes FSK are also frequently generated and detected
 i or q sanket ko jatil-maan sanket i +jq main joda ja saktaa he
 Consequently the actual value known as the equivalent low-pass signal or the equivalent baseband signal is the complex signal physical value representing the complex value
 modulator dwaara data sanchaarit ke liye upyogi nimnlikhit saamaanya kadam hai : The de-modulator usually performs the following on behalf of the receiver: sabhi ankiy sanchaar vyavastha main yah aam he ki modulator or di-modulator donon kaa dizin ek hi saath kiya janaa chahie
 ankiy adhimishran yojanaayen sambhav hai kyonki preshak-praapak donon pakshon ko pehle se jaankaree honi chahie ki kis tarah data kaa kutalekhan kiya jaae or sanchaar vyavastha kaa kaise pratinidhitiv kiya jaae
 sabhi ankiy sanchaar pranaaliyon main, preshak ke aaparivartak or praapak ke di-modulator donon ko is tarah banaaya jaay ki apane kaam ke alaava ek-duusare kaa bhi kaam kar saken
 In the incompatible modulation method, a receiver does not need the reference clock signal that occurs in the same phase with the sender carrier wave
 In such a case, the modulation moves asynchronously in the signal
 iskaa vipareet anukool adhimishran he
 The most common digital modulation techniques are as follows: MSK or GMSK satat charan adhimishran ke vishesh maamlen hai
 Indeed, the MSK of the subcumbus of CPM is a special case, which is also known as a symbolic-time period of continuous phase frequency-shift keying, which is a rectangular frequency pulse
 OFDM frequency divijan multiplexing par aadhaarit he, lekin iskaa upyog ek ankiy adhimishran yojana ke taur par kiya jaataa he
 The bit stream is divided into several parallel data strings and each stream is transferred to its subcarrier using the traditional digital modulation scheme
 OFDM sanket ek adhimishrit sab-carrier kaa sankshipt rup he
 OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multidimensional technique, as it transfers a bit stream to a communication channel using a sequence of so-called ofdms
 OFDM kaa vistaar chanelle acces paddati se orthogonal frequency divijan multiple acces or MC-CDMA skim se multi-eusar channel main kiya ja saktaa he, taaki bahut saare upyog kartaaon ko vibhinn sab-carrier yaa kai upyog kartaaon ko code dekar ek hi madhyam kaa upyog karne kii anumati den saken
 The two types of RF power amplifier, the switching expander, are low-cost and use less battery power than the liner amplifier with the same output power
 baharhaal, ve keval apekshaakrit sthir aayam adhimishran sanket jaise ki koniya adhimishran or CDMA ke saath kaam karata he, lekin QAM or OFDM ke saath nahin
 haalanki swichan vistaarak ek saamaanya QAM samooh ke liye bhi puri tarah se anupyukt he, baavjood iske aksar QAM adhimishran siddhant kaa istemaal swichan vistaarakon ko in FM or anya weveform ke saath chalane main kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi QAM di-modulation kaa istemaal in swimming vistaarakon dwaara sanket praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term baseband modulation is synonymous with line code or symbol
 ye ankiy beet stream kaa anuroop besaband main sthanantaran karne kii paddati he, jiskaa istemaal ek pulse train, jo ki asatat sankhya vaala sanket level he, kaa prayog pratyaksh rup se modulatting ke jariye cabel main voltage or curent main kiya jaataa he
 Common examples are Unipolar, non-return-to-zero, Manchester and Alternate Mark Inverson coding
 pulse adhimishran yojana kaa uddeshy ek nairoband anuroop sanket kaa sthaanantaran anuroop besaband main do str ke sanket ke rup main adhimishran ke jariye pulse wave main karnaa he
 Some pulse modulation scheme narrowband analog signal to a numerical signal a fixed bit rate; Which can be transferred as an embedded numeric sender method, for example some line codes, allowing transfer
 aupchaarik myne main ye adhimishran yojana ke tahat nahin aate, kyonki ye chanelle kutalekhan yojana nahin hai, lekin inhen strot kutalekhan yojana kii tarah liya janaa chahie or kuch maamalon main anuroop se ankiy roopantaran takanic ke rup main

 Belief in Islamic theology refers to a believer's belief in the spiritual aspects of Islamic theology
 isaki sabase saral paribhaasha vishwaas ke chah lekhon main vishwaas he, jise "arkan al-imaan" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It means faith in the six themes of Islam's faith
 imaan shabd quran or haddees-e-jibril donon main chitrit kiya gaya he
 According to the Quran, Imaan must be accompanied by religious deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into heaven
 jibril kii haddees main, islamic dharm ke ayaamon kaa nirmaan yah teen karte hai "islam" "ihasaan" or "imaan"
 Within and outside Islam, religion is discussed for faith and purpose, and the relative importance of both cannot be forgotten
 kai vidwaanon kaa tark he ki ek hi strot or jagah se vishwaas or hetu donon utpann hote hai isliye donon ko saamanjasypurna hona chahie
 In Arabic, Iman, the pronunciation means "faith"
 yah kriya sangya he, آمن, matlab kisi chiz main vishvas rakhana
 In the Hadith, Muhammad Sahib defined as "the meaning of Iman - wisdom in the heart, voice on the tongue, and activity in the hands and feet"
 vishwaas ek bharosa he sachai par jo vaastavik he
 When people believe, they attach themselves to that truth
 sachai jaananaa hi kaaphi nahin he, dil use maananaa bhi chahie, jeebh dwaara vyakt kii jaani chahie jo buddhi kii abhivyakti he or ant main unke aatmavishvaas ko pratibimbit karne ke liye us kaa amal karnaa bhi zaruri he
 Hamiduddin Farahi, in his tafsir, explaining the meaning of Iman, wrote: vishwaas aam taur par vishwaas ke chah lekhon kaa upyog karke ullikhit he: The first of these is mentioned by the Qur'an and the first five by Muhammad, while a doctrine of belief in Allah - the good and the bad of God-ordered destiny - refers to all six in the following way in the Hadith of Gabriel: mohammad se bhi ek or samaan varnan he: "ibn Abbas narrated that Malak Jibril once asked the Prophet:" Tell me what is Iman? "the Prophet replied:" Iman is to believe in Allah, on the Day of Judgment, on His Malaika, books and prophets, And to believe in life after death, and to believe in heaven and hell, and on the establishment of the Mizan which is to weigh our karma, and believe in destiny, on its good and evil
 jibril ne phir un se poocha: "yadi main yah sab karata hum to main imaan ke saath rahoonga?" paigambar ne kaha: " jab aapane yah sab kiya he, to aap imaan main honge
 " yah bhi mana jaataa he ki aavashyak imaan main pehle 3 chize hoti hai 
 In the Quran, one of the 10 virtues is Imaan which one gets due to becoming the recipient of Allah's mercy and reward
 quran kahata he ki vishwaas allaah ke samaran ke saath bad saktaa he
 The Quran also says that in this world there should be nothing but faith that is dear to Momin
 mohammad ne kaha he ki; usne vishwaas kii mithaas praapt kii jo allaah ko ishwar islam ko dharm or mohammad ko paigambar ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 He also said that no one can be a true believer until he loves the Prophet more than his children, parents and relatives
 ek or udhaaharan main, unhone tippanee kii he ki yah allaah or mohammad ke saath prem karne ke baad hi ek vyakti vishwaas ke asli swaad se avgat ho saktaa he
 Amin Ahsan Islahi, one of the Quran's emissaries, has clarified the nature meaning of this love: 

prem keval kisi kii patni, bacchon or anya rishtedaaron ke liye swaabhaavik rup se bhavuk pyaar kaa sanket nahin detaa he, balki yah kuch drushtikon or buddhi or siddhanton ke aadhaar par prem ko bhi sanderbhit karata he
 It is because of this love that a person, in every sphere of life, gives priority to this attitude and principle
 agar vyakti apanai patni, bacchon or rishtedaaron kii maang is drushtikon kii maangon se juujhati he, to vah bina kisi hichkhichahat ke is kaa paalan karata he, isi imaani prem ke kaaran uski patni or bacchon kii ichchhaaon or unke parivaar or kabeeley kii maangon ko kam kar detaa he
 Both Islahi and Maududi have speculated that the Quran's comparison of a good word and a bad word in chapter 14 is actually a comparison of faith and unbelief
 is prakaar, quran prabhavi rup se ek ped par vishwaas kii tulana kar rahaa he jisaki jaden mitti main gahari hai or akaash kii vishalata main shakhaaen faili hui hai
 There is also the subject of a prayer made by Iman Muhammad to Allah: he allaah! maine apane aap ko thukraayaa he or khud ko aap ke hawaale saunp diya he, or main ne aapaki badhaai pahchaan kar pehle aapke sharan main aagaya hoon, aap se bhaag kar kahin bhi sharan milane vaala nahin he
 If you are with anyone then prabhu! maine aapaki pustak main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane prakat kiya he or paigambar main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane paigambaron ke rup main bheja he
 Imam al-behiqi has compiled in his book Shu'ab al-iman that there are 77 branches of faith
 isamen, vah imaan ke aavashyak gunon ko samajhaate huve kurani aaayaaton or nabi kii hadison kaa ullekh kiya he, jo vishvas ko darshaate hai
 The following hadith is based on Muhammad Sahib: abu huraira ne suna he ki paigambar ne kaha tha: "imaan main 70 se adhik shakhaaen hai
 The most excellent of these branches is to read "la Ilaha Ilallah", and the shortest branch is to remove the obstacle read in the way
 or haya imaan kii ek mahatvapurn shakha he
 " islam main, yah aavashyak he ki vishwaas or karmon ke bich sadbhaav or samanvay maujuud ho
 Farahi has explained this aspect in his tafsir in the following way: vishwaas ke baad quran main dharmik karmon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he 


 vishwaas ke maamle main, isaki vyakhya kii aavashyaktaa spasht he: vishwaas kii jagah dil or buddhi he
 In matters of intelligence and heart, not only can a person deceive others but sometimes he himself can be deceived
 vah khud ko ek mumin maanata he jabaki vastav main vah nahin he
 For this reason, it requires two evidences: a person's words and a person's deeds
 chunki shabd asaty ho sakate hai, isliye ek vyakti jo keval shabdon ke madhyam se vishwaas kaa daawa karata he use muman ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he or ise aavashyak samajha jaataa tha ki ek vyakti ke karm bhi uske vishwaas kii gavaahi den
 Thus the Quran said: o you believe with the tongue! Trust through your actions
 islam main tark or vishwaas ke bich sambandh sadiyon se faili ek jatil bahes he
 Ismail Raji al-farooqi explains on this subject: gaiyr-musalmaan islam ke siddhanton kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 However, they should be aware that Islam does not offer its doctrines specifically to those who believe or want to believe
 islam is ko tarksangat rup se, tarksangat rup se pesh karata karata he
 It introduces us to the necessary grounds with logical and consistent arguments
 vyaktigat swaad, yaa vyaktiparak anubhav ke saapeksh aadhaar par asahmat hona hamaare liye vaid nahin he

 His mother died in childhood
 iske kaaran unako ghar main ghor upeksha jhelni padi
 Leaving home at an early age, when he came to Allahabad, he studied English in Shahjahanpur up to intermediate only, and his knowledge of the intellect and intellectuals of the writer was terrorized
 adarsh or yatharthwaad ke us daur main inaki rachanaaon ne donon ke seemaanton ko is prakaar udghaatit kiya ki unke bare main tarah-tarah kii kivdantiyaan failane lagi
 He was a famous Hindi writer, writer and poet
 bhubaneshwar sahitya jagat kaa aisa naam he, jisane apane chote se jivan kaal main li se alag kism kaa sahitya srijan kiya
 Bhubaneswar carved out the irony of the middle class as a symbol of harsh truth
 unhen aadhunik ekankiyon ke janak hone kaa gaurav bhi hasil he
 In many genres such as Ekanki, Kahaani, Kavita, Samiksha, Bhubaneswar gave new creations to literature
 ek aisa sahityakar jisane apni rachanaaon se aadhunik samvednaaon kii nai paripati viksit kii
 Writers like Premchand considered him the creator of the future
 isaki ek khaas vajah yah thi ki bhubaneshwar apane rachanakaal se bahut aage kii soch ke rachanaakaar the
 There is a sense of artlessness in his compositions, but strangely, they seem more relevant to the future than to the past
 ‘kaaravaan’ kii bhoomika main swayan bhubaneshwar ne likhaa he ki ‘vivek or tark teesri shrenee ke kalakaaron ke chor darvaaze hai”
 He believes this to be clearly visible in his works as well
 insaan ko vastu main badalte jane kii jo tasviir unhone ukeri, wo aaj ke samay main or bhi adhik praasangik ho jaati he
 The literature practice of Bhubaneswar was multidimensional
 kahani, kavita, ekanki or samiksha sab main unki lekhnee ek nae kalevar kaa ehsaas dilaati he
 Bhubaneshwar's specialty is to look at even the smallest incident in a new, but most proximate view of reality
 'hans’ main 1933 main bhubaneshwar kaa pehla ekanki ‘shyama: ek vaivaahik vidmbana’ prakashit hua tha
 The Ekanki collection 'caravan', published in 1935, distinguished him as an integrator
 bhubaneshwar dwaara likhit naatak ‘tambe kaa keedaa’ ko vishwa kii kisi bhi bhashaa main bhi likhe gayi pehle asangat naatak kaa sammaan praapt he

 But people forgot to recognize his work
 shaayad yahi kaaran tha, ki is anokhe rachanaakaar ko puraa jivan sangharsho or vivaadon main gujaarna padaa
 Premchand urged him to join Hans permanently
 parantu anjaane kaarnon se ye samvaad puraa naa ho sakaa
 Although his compositions continued to be published in Hans
 lekin agar wo hans ke saath jud jate to unka rachana sansar kahin adhik vistrut rup main hamaare saamne hota
 There was no one to save his last-time compositions, as a result of which the original literature of Hindi and English written on the back of rough papers was completely lost in the darkness
 bhubaneshwar kii uplabdh sabhi rachanaaon ko aaj punah logon tak panhuchane kii aavashyaktaa he

 They were stored and published in 1956 AD by naming them 'caravan'
