 The practice of burying the dead body was prevalent among the Vishnois
 vishnoi sampradaay murti puja main vishwaas maheen karata he
 Hence, there is no idol in Jambhoji's temple and companions
 kuch sthanon par is sampradaay ke sadsy jambhoji kii vastuon kii puja karte hai

 isamen is sampradaay ke bane hue niyamon ke paalan karne par jor diya jaataa tha
 Decisions taken on the occasion of various fairs show that it was compulsory for all to follow the decisions and order of this panchayat and the person who violated it was excommunicated from Vishnoi society

 In 1907, Bikaner ordered the butchers not to pass through any Vishnoi village with goats
 bikaner rajya ke shaskaon ne samay – samay par vishnoi mandiron ko bhumidaan die gaye hai
 Such evidence has been received that Sujan Singh gave 3000 bighas of land to Mukam Temple and 1000 bighas to Janglu Temple
 bikaner ne sanwat 1877 va 1887 main ek aadesh jari kiya tha, jiske anusaar thapanon se bina gunaah ke kuch bhi na lene kaa nirdesh diya tha
 In this way, the ruler of Jodhpur state also gave many concessions in respect of land and rent to the Vishnois

 Relaxed black deer in protected area Black deer resting in protected area, this is not the first time in Rajasthan that hunting of chinkara has come into the limelight

 He has also been sentenced to five years in the case by the lower court

 is maamle main saf ali khan, sonaali bendre or tabboo par bhi aarope tay ho chuke hai
 Actually, Chinkara is not only the state animal of Rajasthan, but like the tiger under Wildlife Protection Act, schedule 1 is wildlife and there is a provision of jail for seven years for hunting it
 phir bhi inaki sankhya main tej giravat dekhi ja rahi he
 There were 37,758 chinkaras in the state in the year 2009 which reduced to 34,970 in the year 2010
 pashchimi rajasthan main bhi inaki taadaad ghat rahi he
 There were 3,076 chinkaras in the Thar Desert in the year 2009 which came down to 2,743 the following year
 saaf jaahir he ki bade paimaane par chinkaara kaa shikaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Rajpal Singh, a member of the Rajasthan Wildlife and Environment Committee, says local residents living in the Thar Desert have been complaining about Chinkara hunting but the administration is not taking the issue seriously
 chintaa kii baat yah he ki is avaidh kaary main sena kaa naam bhi saamne aayaa he
 a person from the Bishnoi community wandering fearlessly near a Chinkarabishnoi community, the local people, especially the Bishnois from western Rajasthan, treat Chinkara as a family member and love him dearly
 bishnoiyon ke gaanvon main hiran or chinkaara parivaar ke bacchon kii bhaanti paale jate hai
 Even Bishnois' devotion to wildlife and environment is unique
 chinkaara shikaar maamle main bhi salmaan khan ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchane main bishnoi samaaj kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 This cult of dying for environmental protection has set an example which is recorded in golden letters on the pages of history
 san 1730 main jodhpur ke paas khejadli gaanv main raja kii sena se khejadi ke pedo kii raksha karte bishnoi samaaj ke 363 stri-purushon ko pedo ke saath hi kaat daalaa tha
 In this incident, 363 Bishnois from 83 villages, led by a woman Amrita Devi, clung to it to save them from cutting down trees
 inamen bachche, buudhe, jawan, mahilaayein sabhi shaamil the
 For Bishnois, protecting the environment and wildlife is their principle of life

 The government has declared Chinkara a state animal, but it does not appear to make any special efforts to protect it
 yahaan tak ki gramin jab apni ankhon ke saamne iskaa shikaar hota dekhte hai or shikaayat karte hai tab bhi sarkari amala uske prati gambhirtha nahin dikhaata he
 Women of Bishnoi community tied to the door of environmental love worshiped trees thar main rahane vaale gramin visheshkar bishnoi panth aaj bhi pedo or vanyajeevon kii raksha ke prati gramin sankalp nahin bhuulaa he
 These people still do not miss even giving their lives to protect them
 haalanki ye baat kehane kii he parantu ab aisa kuch nahin rahaa he
 Nearly a decade ago, a Bishnoi-born youth, Nihalchand, fought his life in an attempt to protect wildlife
 baad main is ghatana par ‘willing tu secrifis’ film bhi banaai gai
 The film was also awarded at the Film Festival held in the Slovak Republic
 rajasthan main ek kahawat prachlit he- ‘sar saathe runkh rahe to bhi sasto jaan’, yani sir katwa kar bhi vrikshon kii raksha ho sake, to ise phaayde kaa sauda hi samajhie
 On the day of Bhadwa Sudi Dashami, dated 1787, in the village of Khejdli in Jodhpur on Tuesday, the saga of sacrificing hundreds of Vishnoi people to protect the trees of Khejdi is a vivid example of this
 is ‘chipko andolan’ main striyaan haraval main thim
 Later, in Uttaranchal, the 'chipko expedition' of forest protection, instigated by Sundarlal Bahuguna, was carried out by ordinary housewives
 aaj jis tarah suniyojit tareeke se jangalon ko ujaadne kaa abhiyaan khud sarkaron tak kii ore se chalaaya ja rahaa he, waisi sthiti main wanon ko bachaane ke liye ‘chipko abhiyaan’ jaisi saamaajik patibaddhta kii jarurat he
 The story of the sacrifice of Khejdali is exciting and inspiring
 jodhpur kile ke nirmaan main kaam aane vaali lakadiyon kii aapurti ke liye vahaan khejadi ke vrikshon kii kataai kaa nirnay liya gaya
 On this, the people of Khejdali village decided to protect the forest even at the cost of their lives
 churaasi gaanvon ko is faisle kii soochna de di gai
 Hundreds of people gathered in the village of Khedjali and clung to the trees to prevent them from cutting
 lekin shashan ne isaki parvaah nahin kii or jab barbartapurvak pedo ko kaata jane laga un par chipke hue logon ke sharir ke tukade-tukade hokar girane lage
 When one person is cut, another person immediately sticks to the same tree
 is balidaan main amritadevi or unki do putriyaan haraval main raheen
 Among the men, Anandoji was the first to sacrifice and later Vrito Baniyal, Chavoji, Udoji, Kanhoji, Kisanoji, Dayaram etc
 Men and women like Dami, Chami etc
 laid down their lives
 kul mila kar teen sau tirasth stri-purushon ne apni jaan de di
 When the Maharaja of Jodhpur came to know about this incident, he stopped the cutting of trees and ordered not to cut trees there in future
 khejadli ke in veeron kii smriti main yahaan har varsh bhadva sudi dashami ko mela lagata he, jisamen hajaaron kii sankhya main log ikatthe hote hai
 The poet Gokuji, describing this incident, has written in Khejdali's Sakhi - 'udo saar samahi aayo, head entrusted Runkha sattai / head assigned ar not kampa, be afraid of death
 ’ van kii raksharth swechha se praan dene kii aisi anek ghatnaayen hai, jinhen ‘khejadli ke khadaane’ se janaa jaataa he
 Even before the unceremonious sacrifice of Khejdali, many men and women of the desert of Rajasthan volunteered their lives to protect the forests
 itihaas ke pannon main dafan ho chuke ye stri-purush jambhoji ke anuyaayi the
 Jambhoji promoted Vishnoi religion to the Kartik Vadi Ashtami of Samvat 1542 and preached to his followers in 'sabad Vani' to protect the forests
 jambhoji ke bhakt kavi oodoji nain ne vishnoi dharm ke anuyaayiyon ke liye untiis niyamon main vrikshon kii raksha par jor dete hue likhaa- ‘karai runkh pratipaal khejadaa rakhat rakhaavai
 The poet Vilhoji, in 'batis Aakhri', prohibited the cutting of trees by saying 'ash Daya Ghat Mahi, tree not wound'
 jambhoji ke anuyaayiyon ne apane gaanvon ke chaaron ore oran main ped lagaae or unki raksha kii
 The spirit of sacrifice or sacrifice is still alive to protect the forest and wildlife in Vishnoi society
 khejadli main pedo kii raksha ke liye atmotsarg kaa aisa samuhik svaichhik anushthan vishwa bhar main anoothaa or adwitiya he
 Inspired by the glorious legacy of this sacrifice, every Rajasthani should be determined to conserve and promote forests
 anusuchit janajatiyon kaa bhi janmajaat judaav jal, jangal, jameen se rahaa he
 Therefore, society should be made the 'keeper' of forest wealth
 bharat kii do lakh taees hajaar panchayaton ko van rakshan samskruti kaa samvahak banaaya jaae
 a 'smriti Van' should be established in every Panchayat headquarters
 har shikshan santhaan, sarkari daftar ke praangan main vriksharopan kaarykram chalaaya jaae
 Let each city be a green city
 jahaan bhi vrikshon kii kataai karke audyogic ikaayiyon, khanij utkhanan or sadak vistaar kii ikaayiyon kii sthapana kii jaati he, vahaan pehle se chaar guna vrikshon ko lagane ke baad hi utpaadan shuru karne kii ijaajat di jaae
 Desert cannot be lush with paperwork only by governmental efforts
 svaichhik saamaajik sansthaaon ke sahyog, aam jan main uttaradayitv kii bhaavana kaa vikaas or sarkari yojanaon ke yathasambhav sahi kriyanvayan se hi is uddeshy kii purti kii ja sakati he
 Plantation, conservation, promotion should be the campaign of the people, only then the greenery of forest expansion can be found in the desert of Rajasthan
 saghan van hi meghon ko aamantrit kar barsaat ke liye prerit karata he
 If there is no forest, no rain, no rain, then there is no swollen earth

 malala yusufazai mingora, jo swat kaa mukhya shahar he, main rahati he
 Mingora was captured by the Taliban from March 2009 to May 2009, until the Pakistani Army launched a campaign to gain control of the area
 sangharsh ke dauraan, 11 saal kii umr main hi malala ne diary likhni shuru kar di thi
 Malala first appeared in the world in 2009, writing a diary for BBC Urdu under the pseudonym "gul Corn"
 jisamen usne swat main taliban ke kukrityon kaa varnan kiya tha or apane dard ko diary main bayaan kiya
 Malala, fond of writing a diary, wrote in her diary, 'today was the last day of school, so we decided to play a little longer on the field
 meraa maananaa he ki ek din skool khulegaa lekin jate samay maine skool kii imaarat ko is tarah dekha jaise main yahaan phir kabhi nahin aauungi
 ' malala ne blog or media main taliban kii jyadatiyon ke bare main jab se likhnaa shuru kiya tab se use kai baar dhamkiyaan milin
 At the age of 11, Malala worked to bring painful stories related to the fanatical decrees of the Taliban in front of people
 malala un peedit ladakiyon main se he jo taliban ke farmaan ke kaaran lambey samay tak skool jane se vanchit raheen
 Three years ago, the Taliban banned girls from going to school in the Swat Valley
 ladakiyon ko tivi kaarykram dekhne kii bhi manaahi thi
 ता The Taliban were in possession of the Swat Valley and there was a ban on many things from the school
 malala bhi isaki shikaar hui
 But through his diary, Malala not only made the people of the region aware but also took a stand against the Taliban
 taliban ne varsh 2007 main swat ko apane kabje main le liya tha
 And kept in constant possession

 During that time the school of two hundred girls was demolished by the Taliban
 varsh 2009 main taliban ne saaf kaha tha ki 15 janvari ke baad ek bhi ladki skool nahin jaaegi
 If anyone refuses to obey this edict, she will be responsible for her own death

 Champu is a distinction of audio poetry, that is, mixed poetry of prose-verse is called Champu
 gadhy tathaa padya mishrit kavy ko "champu" kehete hai
 This mode of poetry has not been mentioned by the ancient masters of literature - Bhamah, Dandi, Vamana etc
 yon gadhy padyamay style kaa prayog vaidic sahitya, buddha jataka, jatakamala aadi ati pracheen sahitya main bhi miltaa he
 The beginning of the Champukavya tradition is derived from the Atharva Veda
 champoo naam ke prakrut kavy kii rachana dasvin shatee ke pehle nahin hui
 'nalchampu', composed by Trivikram Bhatt, which is an early tenth century work, is a famous example of Champu
 iske atirikt somdev suri dwaara rachit yashatilak, bhojraj krit champoo ramayana, kavi karnapuri krit anandavrindavan, gopal champoo, nilkantha champoo or champoo bharat dasvin se satrahavin shatee tak ke udhaaharan hai
 This poetic form could not become more popular nor did it get special recognition in poetry
 hindi main yashodhara ko champoo-kavy kaha jaataa he, kyonki usamen gadhy-padya donon kaa prayog hua he
 The proper division of this mixture of prose and verse seems to be that the description of affective subjects should be presented by verse and descriptive subjects should be presented by prose
 parantu champurchayitaaon ne is manovaigyanik vaishishty par vishesh dhyaan na dekar donon ke sanmishran main apni swatantra ichha tathaa vaiyaktik abhiruchi ko hi mahatv diya he
 The mixture of prose-poetry is ancient in Sanskrit literature, but the poetic style, the possessive noun of "champu", cannot be considered as ancient as the compositional mixture of prose-verse
 gadhy-padya kii mishrit rachana krishna yajurvedic samhitaon main uplabdh hoti he
 Pali natives also have the achievement of the storyline in prose and the original formulaic allusions in verse
 parantu kavyatatv se virahit hone ke kaaran inhen ham "champu" kaa drushtaant kisi prakaar nahin maan sakate
 The Prayagprashasti of Samudragupta composed by Harishan and the Buddhist poet Ayanshur Praneeth Jatakamala can be considered primitive forms of Champu, as in the first, the Digvijay of Samudragupta and 34 Jatakas in the second are described in elaborate prose verse taking shelter of pure poetic style
 prathit hota he ki champu gadhykavy kaa hi ek paribrihit rup he or isiliye gadhykavy ke suvarnyug ke ananthar navam shatee ke aasapaas is kavyarup kaa udai hua
 The first paradigm of Champu poetry is the Nalchampu of Trivikram Bhatt in which the characteristic of Champu springs up
 dakshin ke rashtrakutvanshi raja krishna ke pautra, raja jagatug or lakshmi ke putr, indraraj ke aashray main rahakar trivikram ne is ruchir champu kii rachana kii thi
 The coronation of Indraj was in the year 972 and due to his dependence, the poet also has the same time as the first half of the tenth century
 is champu ke saat uchhvaason main nal tathaa damayanti kii vikhyath pranaykatha kaa bada hi chamatkaari varnan kiya gaya he
 In poetry, the Prasad of Shubhasa Sambhava Shlasa is targeted everywhere
 jain kavi somprabhasuri kaa "yashastilak champu" dasham shatee ke madhyakaal kii kriti he 
 The philosopher Rashtrakutnaresh was the synagogue of the son of Krishna's feudatory Chalukya Arikeshri
 is champu main jain puraanon main prakhyat raja yashodhar kaa charitra vistaar ke saath varnit he
 In the last three abuses of Champu by presenting a detailed account of the principles of Jainism, the poet has sufficiently propagated these principles
 granth main us yug ke naanavidh dharmik, aarthik tathaa saamaajik vishyon kaa vivaran somprabhasuri kii vyapak tathaa bahumukhi vandushi kaa parichaayak he
 Many talented poets have demonstrated their talent by reciting the charitas of Rama and Krishna
 aise champu kaavyon main bhojraj kaa ramayana champu, anantbhatta kaa "bharat champu", shesh shrikrishna kaa "parijataharan champu" kaaphi prasiddh hai
 Bhojraj had composed the Ramayana Champu till the Kishkindha scandal, which was completed by Lakshman Bhatt, "yudh Kand" and Venkatraj composed the "uttara Kanda"
 jain kaviyon ke samaan chaitanya mataavlambee vaishnav kaviyon na apane siddhanton ke pasar ke liye is lalit kavyamadhyam ko badi safalataa se apanaaya
 The theme of Lord Sri Krishna's Lalaam Leelas is such a beautiful occasion when these poets presented the offerings of their extraordinary talent to the devout readers through their champu poems
 kavi karnpur kaa anandavrindavan champu, tathaa jeev goswami kaa gopalchampu saras kavy kii drushti se nitant safal kavy hai
 The first of these poems gives a detailed and vivid description of Krishna's balalilas, the second verse is a poignant description of Krishna's entire character
 "virmitroday" ke prakhyat rachayita mitra mishra kaa "aanandakand champu" krishnaparak champuon main ek ruchir shrunkhlaa jodta he
 In South India too, Champukyas were not less popular
 nilkanth dikshit kaa "nilkanthavijay champu" samudrmanthan ke vishay main he 
 Sri Vaishnava Venkatadhwari's "vishvagunadarsha Champu" is unique from other champs in that it has inaugurated the defects and virtues in many of India's numerous pilgrimages, religions and scribes together
 yah vishesh lokapriy kavy he
 The "chitrachampu" of Vanishvara Vidyalankar is a composition of a typical Pandit poet of Bengal in which Bhakti's attainment by Bhakti is indicated through a succinct narrative in Rupakshali
 is prakaar sanskrit sahitya main bhaavon ke prakaton ke nimitt anek shatabdiyon tak lokapriy madhyam hone par bhi uttar bhartiya bhashasahitya main champu kavy drudhmul na ho sakaa
 Generally, in the literature of Dravidi language, especially in Kerala and Andhra literature, Champu poetry is popular even today, which attracts the attention of poets towards the practice

 chuunaa calsiumyukt ek acarbonic padaarth he jisamen carbonate, oxide, or hydraksaide pramukh hai
 But, rightly, calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide is considered as lime
 chuunaa ek khanij bhi he
 Lime is the oldest material used for plowing in home construction, but now it has been replaced by Portland Cement
 chooney kaa nimnlikhit do pramukh bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : The quantity of calcium in this lime and the insoluble substance in acid is about six percent
 calosium 71
43 pratishat ore oxijan 28
57 pratishat rahete hai
 This lime is made by burning limestone, chalk or oyster
 yah pani se jamata nahin he
 The lime thus presented is white, amorphous
 pani main bujhaae jane par footataa nahin, keval phulataa ore chur chur ho jaataa tathaa saath hi paryaapt maatra main ushma detaa he
 Such extinguished lime is called aqueous or extinguished lime
 chooney ko bujhane kii ek reeti yah he ki ek naand main ek foot oonchaai tak chuunaa bharkar usamen teen foot tak pani bhar dete hai
 Leave it like this for 24 hours or more, that is, until it is completely extinguished
 bujh jane ke baad ise prativarg inch 12 chhidravali chalani se chaan lenaa chahie
 The carbon dioxide of the air in pure lime mortar combines to form calcium carbonate, which hardens and hardens
 moti diwaar banane main iskaa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki aantarik bhagavale chooney ko calosium carbonate main parivartit hone ke liye carbon dioxide paryaapt maatra main praapt nahin hota
 For this reason, such slurry does not connect bricks properly
 bhitari deevaaron par patala plasters karne or patali deevaaron kii judai ke liye hi yah upyukt hota he
 By adding granulated sand to the lime, its additive properties are increased
 isse vaayu ke pravesh ke liye paryaapt rikt sthaan praapt hota he
 Cement and lime mortar are also used
 chooney se sankochan or daraaren kam hoti or chaar bhaag cement main ek bhaag chuunaa milaane se bina dridhtaa kam kiye vyavhaaryata bad jaati he
 Instead of 1 part cement, 3 parts sand in slurry, it is better to have 1 part cement 1 part lime 6 parts sand
 chooney main surkhi milaane or chakki main pisane ke isaki jaldridhtaa bad jaati he
 Such lime is found mostly in Dehradun in Uttarakhand and Satna in Madhya Pradesh
 yah chuunaa badi maatra main kankad yaa mitti yukt chuunaapatthar kaa jalaakar banaaya jaataa he
 The lime that settles under water in 7 to 30 days is called lime
 pani main jamane ke samay ke aadhaar par ise mand jal, madhyam jal or uttam jal chuunaa kehete hai
 Lime can hold 5 to 30 percent soil and the amount depends on the freezing
 chooney main mitti kii maatra kii vruddhi se bujhane kii kriya mand hoti he or jal dridhtaa gun badhata he
 Water lime contains silica, alumina, and iron oxide as impurities that, combined with lime, form compounds that harden and harden underwater
 jal chooney ko upyog main laane se thik pehle bujhaana chahie, taiyaar hone ke turant baad hi nahin
 Such lime is used under water and in places where firmness is necessary
 jalaakar chuunaa banane ke liye aavashyak kankad uttar bharat ke maidani bhaagon main sataha se kuch foot neeche paae jate hai
 In Maharashtra, there is a temple of Ghrishneshwar Mahadev, 11 km from Daulatabad, near Aurangabad
 yah baarah jyotirlingon main se ek he
 Some people also call it as Ghushmeshwar
 buddha bhikshuon dwaara nirmit ellora kii prasiddh guphaayen is mandir ke sameep hi sthit hai
 This temple was built by Goddess Ahilyabai Holkar
 shahar se dur sthit yah mandir saadagi se paripurna he
 This is the last Jyotirlinga in Dwadash Jyotirlingas

 It is located near Verulgaon, twelve miles away from Daulatabad in the state of Maharashtra
 dakshin desh ke devgiri parvat ke nikat sukarma naamak brahman apni pati parayan patni sudesh ke saath rahata tha
 Both of them were devotees of Shiva but worried about not having children
 patni ke aagrah par uske patni kii bahan ghusma ke saath vivha kiya jo param shiv bhakt thi
 By Shiva's grace he received a son's wealth
 isse sudesh car ishya hone lagi or usne avasar paa kar sout ke bete kii hatya kar di
 By the grace of Lord Shiva, the child rose up and on the request of Ghushma, gave him the boon to live there forever and started living there and the name of that pond, also known as Ghushmeshwar, has since become Shivalaya
 is jyotirling ke vishay main puraanon main yah katha varnit he- dakshin desh main devgiriparvat ke nikat sudharma naamak ek atyant tejasvi taponisht brahman rahata tha
 His wife's name was Sudeha
 The two had a lot of mutual love
 kisi prakaar kaa koi ksht unhen nahin tha
 But he had no child
 jyotish-gananaa se pataa chalaa ki sudeha ke garbh se santanotpatti ho hi nahin sakati
 Sudeha was very keen on children
 usne sudharma se apni choti bahan se doosraa vivaah karne kaa aagrah kiya
 At first Sudharma did not think about this
 lekin ant main unhen patni kii jid ke aage jhukna hi padaa
 They could not defer his request
 ve apni patni kii choti bahan ghushma ko byaah kar ghar le aae
 Ghushma was a very gracious and virtuous woman
 vah bhagavan shiv kii anany bhaktha thi
 She used to worship him with true devotion of heart by making one hundred and one earth shivling every day
 bhagwaan shivaji kii krupa se thode hi din baad uske garbh se atyant sundar or swasth balak ne janm liya
 The birth of the child did not cross the pleasure of both Sudeha and Ghushma
 donon ke din bade aaraam se biit rahe the
 But do not know how soon after a few days a misconception was born in Sudeha's mind
 vah sochane lagi, meraa to is ghar main kuch he nahin
 Everything belongs to Ghushma
 ab tak sudharma ke man kaa kuvichaar rupi ankur ek vishaal vriksh kaa rup le chukaa tha
 Finally one day he killed Ghushma's young son while sleeping at night
 uske shav ko le jaakar usne usee talab main phenk diya jisamen ghushma pratidin parthiv shivlingon ko phenkaa karti thi He also took possession of my husband
 santan bhi usee kii he
 This idea gradually grew in his mind
 idhar ghushma kaa vah balak bhi bada ho rahaa tha
 Gradually he became young
 uskaa vivaah bhi ho gaya
 Everyone came to know about this in the morning
 puure ghar main kuharaam much gaya
 Both Sudharma and his daughter-in-law beat their heads and wept bitterly
 lekin ghushma nity kii bhanti bhagavan shiv kii aradhana main tallin rahi
 As if nothing has happened
 puja samaapt karne ke baad vah parthiv shivlingon ko talab main chhodane ke liye chal padi
 When she started returning from the pond, her beloved Lal was seen coming out of the pond
 vah sadaa kii bhanti aakar ghushma ke charnon par gir padaa
 As if you are walking around from somewhere
 isi samay bhagavan shiv bhi vahaan prakat hokar ghushma se var maangane ko kehane lage
 He was extremely enraged by Sudeha's heavy-handed actions
 apane trishul dwaara uskaa galaa kaatane ko udyat dikhalaai de rahe the
