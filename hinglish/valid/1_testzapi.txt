apane purv arthshaastron kii rachana kii baat swayan kautilya ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 In his 'arthashastra' he has mentioned Acharya Vrihaspati, Bharadwaja, Shukracharya, Parashar, Pishun, Vishalaksha etc
 in many references
 kautilya ke purv anek aacharyon ke granthon kaa namakaran dandniti ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It seems that Kautilya's earlier scriptures were called Dandaniti and were similar to Arthashastra
 parantu jaisaa ki anek vidwaanon ne sweekaar kiya he ki dandniti or arthshaastra donon samroop nahin hai
 U
 N
 According to Ghoshal's statement, Arthashastra is a more comprehensive scripture, whereas Dandaniti is only its branch
 kautilya ke paashchaat likhe gayi shaastra 'nitishastra' ke naam se vikhyath hue, jaise kaamandak nitisar
 By the way, many scholars have considered economics more comprehensive than ethics
 parantu, adhikansh vidwaanon kii raay main nitishastra or arthshaastra donon samroop hai tathaa donon ke vishay kshetra bhi ek hi hai
 Kamandaka himself has considered ethics and economics to be identical
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht he ki kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or uske baad bhi 'arthshaastra' jaise shastron kii rachana kii gayi
 In this regard, there are a large number of scholars who believe that Kautilya was not the creator of 'arthashastra'
 aise vidwaanon main paashchaatya vidwaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 Stan, Jolly, Winterneese and Keith are exponents of this type of thought

 bhandarkar ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he
 Bhandarkar has said that Patanjali did not mention Kautilya in the Mahabhashya
 'arthshaastra' ke rachayita ke rup main kautilya ko nahin manyata denevaalon ne apane mat ke samarthan main nimnlikhit tark prastut kiye hai— It is clearly written at the end of the book- saath hi yah bhi likhaa gaya he: This incident is discussed in Vishnu Purana as follows: ‘nitisar’ ke karta kaamandak ne bhi ghatana kii pushti karte hue likhaa he: It is clear from these quotes that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were the same person
 ‘arthshaastra’ main hi dwitiya adhikaran ke dasham adhyay ke ant main pustak ke rachayita kaa naam ‘kautilya’ bataaya gaya he: By writing 'kautilyan Kritam Shastra' at the beginning of the book and 'iti Kautiliyearthastra' at the end of each chapter, the author has made his' Kautilya name more famous
 jahaan-jahaan anya aacharyon ke mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he, ant main ‘iti kautilya’ arthath kautilya kaa mat he-is tarah kahkar kautilya naam ke liye apana adhik pakshpaat pradarshit kiya he
 But it is absolutely undisputed that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were integral persons
 uttarkalin dandi kavi ne ise acharya vishnugupt naam se yadi kaha he, to banbhatta ne ise hi kautilya naam se pukaara he
 The statement of both is that this Acharya composed 'dandaniti' or 'arthashastra'
 panchatantra main isi acharya kaa naam chanakya diya gaya he, jo arthshaastra kaa rachayita he
 In the poet visakhadatta-praneeth well-known drama Mudrarakshas, chanakya is sometimes referred to as Kautilya and sometimes Vishnugupta
 ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana ‘shashan-vidhi’ ke rup main pratham maury samraat chandragupta ke liye kii gai
 Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the period of its creation as the period of the emperor Chandragupta

 As stated above, its main subject is governance-law or governance-science: "kautilyan Narendrathe's rule of law: Krita"
 ’’ in shabdon se spasht he ki acharya ne isaki rachana raajnneeti-shaastra tathaa visheshtya shashan-prabandh kii vidhi ke rup main kii
 Seeing the table of contents of economics, it is well proved that it is a mistake to call it the book of economics nowadays
 pratham adhikaran ke prarambh main hi swayan acharya ne ise 'dandniti' naam se suchit kiya he
 Shukracharya has described Dandaniti as such an important discipline that it has assumed the presence of all other disciplines - because according to the dictation of 'shastren Rakshe Deshe Shastraschhinta Pravartate', there can be concern or practice of other scriptures in the country, well protected and protected by weapons
 is
 at: dandniti ko anya sab vidyaon kii aadharbhoot vidya ke rup main sweekaar karnaa aavashyak he or vahi dandniti arthshaastra he
 The term 'dialogue' has been used for what is now called economics, although the term is not entirely indicative of economics
 kautilya ne vaarta ke teen ang kahe hai - krishi, vaanijya tathaa pashu-paalan, jinase praaia: vritti yaa jeevika kaa uparjan kiya jaataa tha
 The scholars of Manu, Yajnavalkya etc
 have also accepted the dialogue of these three parts
 peeche shukracharya ne is vaarta main kuseed ko bhi vritti ke saadhan-rup main sammilit kar diya he
 But economics has been described by all the scholars as politics, politics or governance
 at: ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko raajnneeti kii pustak samajhnaa hi thik hoga na ki sampattishastra kii pustak
 By the way, in some cases, the relevant topics of wealth creation, wealth and wealth exchange, wealth division etc
 have also been discussed
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran kaa praarambhik vachan is sambandh main adhik prakaash daalane vaala he: That is, this one economics has been created by taking the summary of all the economics which the ancient masters have written to win the earth and show the ways of rearing
 yah uddhran arthshaastra ke vishay ko jahaan spasht karata he, vahaan is satya ko bhi prakashit karata he ki ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ se purv anek aacharyon ne arthshaastra kii rachanaaen kin, jinka uddeshy prithvi-vijay tathaa uske paalan ke upayon kaa pratipaadan karnaa tha
 Some names of those Acharyas and their sects have been directed in 'kautilya Arthashastra', although their works are not available even today
 ye naam nimnlikhit he: In the tenants of these ten sects of economics, almost everything is known in relation to everyone, but very little introduction is found about Vishalaksha
 in naamon se yah to atyant spasht he ki arthshaastra nitishastra ke prati anek mahaan vichaarkon tathaa darshanikon kaa dhyaan gaya or is vishay par ek ujjwal sahitya kaa nirmaan hua
 Today that literature is lost
 anek videshi akramanon tathaa rajyakrantiyon ke kaaran is sahitya kaa naam-maatr shesh rah gaya he, parantu jitna bhi sahitya avshisht he vah ek vistrut arthshaastreey parampara kaa sanket karata he
 In this Arthashastra, such a system of governance has been enacted in which the king or ruler rules for the welfare of the subjects
 raja swechhachari hokar shashan nahin kar saktaa
 He has to rule over the subjects only after getting the help of the Council of Ministers
 rajya-purohit raja par ankush ke samaan he, jo dharm-maarg se chyut hone par raja kaa niyantran kar saktaa he or use kartavya-paalan ke liye vivash kar saktaa he
 Kautilya, which is the form of an all-round nation, is clear from the following word of 'arthashastra' - arthath-praja ke sukh main raja kaa sukh he, prajake hit main uskaa hit he
 The king has nothing but his own love, the beloved of the people is his favorite
 400 ri0 san ke lagbhag kaamandak ne kautilya ke arthshaastra ke aadhaar par kaamandakeey nitisar naamak 20 sargon main vibhakt kavyarup ek arthshaastra likhaa tha
 It also considers the principles of ethics and foreign policy
 somdev suri kaa nitivakyamrita, hemachandra kaa laghu arthniti, bhoj kaa yuktikalpataru, shukr kaa shukraniti aadi kuch duusare suprasiddh arthshaastra hai, jinako nitishastra ke vyaavhaarik paksh kii vyakhya karne vaale granthon ke antargat bhi gina ja saktaa he

 If seen broadly, it has been accepted for a long time that the development of a healthy national financial system is an important goal and catalyst towards achieving the macro goal of national economic development
 However, after the Second World War, efforts by national organizers and experts to develop financial services for the majority of the population of their countries have failed, for a brief description of the reasons, Edams, Graham and von Pischke in their best analysis 'undermining Rural Development with Cheap Credit'

 An analysis of 28 studies related to informal lending rates has proved that 76% of moneylenders' lending rates exceeded 10% per month, including 22% crossing 100% per month

 Theoretically, the scope of micro-finance may include efforts to provide greater amounts of financial services to poor people at the moment or to benefit from the benefits that they receive, or to improve their quality
 
 Poor people, for example, borrow from informal moneylenders and save on informal collectors

 Several important debates have arisen around micro-finance
 vyashti-vitt ke vyavsaayee or dani, aksar yah daleel pesh karte hai ki laghu-rin, utpaadak prayojanon ke liye, jaise laghu-udhyam shuru karne athwa uske vistaar tak simit kiya janaa chahie
 In response to this, private sector advocates argue that it is impossible to ban due to the existence of money and that under no circumstances should the rich people decide how the poor should spend their money
 sambhavat: soodiori ke bare main paramparaagat pashchimi vichaardhaara se prabhavit hokar, paaramparik sahuukaar kii bhoomika kii, khaas kar aadhunik vyashti-vitt ke praarambhik daur main, kadi aalochana kii gai
 As more and more poor people started getting loans from micro-lending institutions, it became clear that the services of moneylenders were proving valuable
 udhaarkarta, twarit rin sanvitaran, gopneeyata or lacheele chukauti kaarykram jaisi sevaaon ke liye behad zyaada byaaj dar dene ke liye taiyaar the
 They have never felt that getting a lower rate of interest as adequate compensation is greater than the cost of attending training courses or monthly collateral contributions in terms of attending meetings, qualifying for disbursement
 jab ve duusare kaarnon ke liye aksar udhaar liya karte the, tab unako aisa bahaanaa karne par majaboor karnaa bhi aruchikar laga ki ve kaarobaar shuru karne ke liye udhaar le rahe hai
 Because of the greater emphasis on the overall financial system in the recent past, moneylenders will gain more legitimacy to argue in favor of regulation and to strive to increase competition among poor people to increase the options available to them

 In the case of interdependent lending, the outstanding debt amounted to 0
9% after 30 days, while 0
3% debt write-offs were done
 Since the lower the loan volume, the lower the operating margin, many micro-finance institutions believe that lending to men is more risky

 The constraints or challenges in building a strong commercial micro-finance industry are as follows: • daniyon kii anupyukt sahaayta raashi • Poor supervision of micro-finance institutions accepting regulation and deposits • gini-chuni vyashti-vitt sansthaaen, jo bachat, preshan athwa beemaa sambandhi zaruuratein puri karen • Limited management capacity of micro-finance institutions • sansthagat adakshataayen • The need for greater dissemination and adoption of rural, agricultural oriented micro-finance practices

 Because all the value is accumulated before the need, this money management strategy is called 'saving up'
 aksar logon ke paas zarurat ke mauqon par paise nahin hote hai, isliye ve udhaar lete hai
 a poor family can borrow from their relatives to buy land, from a money lender to buy rice, or from a micro-finance institution to buy a sewing machine
 chunki kharch uthaane ke baad ye rin bachat main se chukaane padate hai isliye rudarford ise ‘neeche kii bachat’ kehete hai
 Rutherford believes that only half the problem has been averted with micro-loans, and this part is of little importance

 a parallel example of this can be seen in the West, in which funds for family business mostly come from savings and especially at the outset

 At the end of education, Akbar got Rahim married to his daughter's daughter Mahabano
 iske baad rahim ne gujarat, kumbhalaner, udaipur aadi yudhon main vijay praapt kii
 On this, Akbar honored Rahim with the highest title of his time, 'mirarj'

 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
