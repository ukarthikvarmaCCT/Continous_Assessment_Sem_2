 Its story revolves around Poonam, who is stuck in a dilemma as to how she will be able to take care of her parents after marriage, because after marriage she has to leave her parents and stay in the husband's house Will have to
 punam kaa iklauta bhai hi rahata he, wo bhi america main hi bas chukaa he, or use apane mata-pita kii chintaa bhi nahin rahati he
 Poonam's marriage is decided by Gautam, a greedy and only self-obsessed boy
 uske liye shaadi kaa koi mahatv nahin he, bas wo shaadi keval dahej ke liye karnaa chahta he
 On the wedding day, Poonam comes to know about the reality of Gautam and his family and she refuses to marry
 usee din uski shaadi akaash se ho jaati he, jo shaadi ke kaam karata he
 Akash marries Poonam without telling her family, and due to this a problem also starts
 akaash ke parivaar vaale punam ko apni bahu sweekaar nahin karte hai
 Poonam is given 6 months time by Akash's family, in which she must win the hearts of all, if she cannot win, she will have to leave the house
 vahiin akaash ko punam ke mata-pita kii pareshaani dikhti he or unki madad karne ke liye wo unhen apane ghar le jaataa he
 Both families fall under the same roof
 bundelkhand ke dushyant kumaar-virendra khare 'akelaa' Shayari is not the one who can sew paper
 shaayari wo he jo ehsaas kii narmo-najuk ungaliyon se dil kii gaharaai main lafzon kii tis uker de or aise shaayar ko uski kitaaben nahin balki wo sher zindaa rakhte hai jo logon kii jubaan kii kushbu ban kar zahano-dil par zarur naksh ho gayi hai
 This is the reason that their lions can be heard by anyone anywhere
 ‘akelaa’ ji ne gazalen, geet, muktak, chand, dohe or azaad nazmen, har vidha main apni salaahiyat ke johar dikhaae hai
 First of all, i make them go through the Ghazals
 ghazal ek aisi vidha he jisamen shaayar apane dil kii baat apni shaayari kii zabaan main kam se kam lafzon main jitne prabhaavshaalee tareeqe se kah letaa he utanaashaayari kii kisi or vidha main mumkin nahin
 That is, if there are seven lions in a ghazal, then it has seven different moods, seven different emotions and on that too the efforts of the poet is to try to get to the bottom of every fun and to connect Samayin with each of his fun
 Try your best
 ek jamaane main ghazal farsi waalon kii miraas maani jaati thi jiskaa maqaan baadshahon or nawabon ke darbar hua karte the
 Whose total was Sarmaya Husno-ishq and delicate mood
 farsi se urdu tak is ghazal ko aane main jin jin raaston se guzaranaa padaa thik vahi raste hindi ghazal ko urdu ghazal se rasta tay karke apane maqaam tak aane main darpesh aaye
 Every good thing is nobody's inheritance
 aakhir ghazal kii itani acchhee vidha ko baadshahon or nawabon ke mahal kahan tak band pate
 When this mode of Ghazal came out of the streets of Delhi, it adopted its common tongue of the people there
 ab aise khaas mode kaa bayaan karnaa yahan bahut zaruri he ki kya wo tamaam shaayar jo farsi se hat kar ghazal kah rahe the un sabhi ke naamon se ham vaaqif he? nahin, unamem se aaj jo naam baaqi hai ye sirf un shaayaron ke naam baaqi hai jinhone besamajhe-buujhe shaayari nahin kii thi, balki ye wo log hai jo farsi se, farsi ghazal ke labo-lahaze, uske auzaan or uski tamaam nazaaqaton se vaaqif the or aise logon ne jab farsi se hat kar us daur kii avam kii lashkari zabaan urdu main shaayari kii to wo farsi ghazal kaa puraa rang urdu ghazal main bharne main kaamyaab hue or jab farsi daan tabaqe ne us urdu ghazal ko suna or padhaa to use kahana padaa ki haan vaaqai ye ghazal he
 Only the words have changed, the soul of Ghazal has not changed
 jab tak urdu ghazal ne apane aap ko farsi ghazal kii kasuti par nahin rakhaa tab tak urdu ke ye do do misare ghazal ke maqaam tak nahin pahunche
 This thing is understandable that if the poet of any language writes Doha or any Savaiya, then he will have to make the scale of Doha or Savaiya of Hindi genre
 uski naap-taul bhi usee paimaane par hogi or agar aisa nahin he to kisi ko haragiz ye haq hasil nahin ki wo apane hisaab se koi bhi paimaana muqarrar kar le or use doha yaa savaiya kaa naam de de
 The reason why the Persian people rejected the Urdu ghazal at that time was the only reason for it and even today those who do not consider Hindi ghazal as ghazal
 hindi ke zyaadaatar gajalkaar jo urdu kii auzaane-shaayari se vaaqif nahin hai unhone jab ghazal likhi to wo ghazal kii kasuti par khari nahin utari or use ghazal nahin sweekaara gaya
 But there also came some people who were aware of the tongue of ghalibo-mir, who had greed in their souls, who were aware of the journey of ghazals ranging from Amir Khusro to Bashir Badr and at the same time they had authority over Hindi language
 aise kuch logon ne jab yahi do do misaron vaali hindi shaayari kii to urdu vaale bhi chaunk gaye or unhone kaha ki ye to ghazal he
 This is how Hindi ghazal started; Like Persian to Urdu - this diversion from Urdu to Hindi ghazal was very important because the people of the present day language are not possible to understand the complete Urdu
 zarurat khud apane raste bana leti he or is raste ke khubasurat mode par jo chand log khadey hai, jinaki shaayari ke aadhaar par aane vaale saahitiyik naslein hindi ghazal kaa apana paimaana banaaengi unamem ek naam virendra khare ‘akelaa’ kaa bhi he
 Now look at Urdu ghazal addicts, lonely 'alone' in the Hindi ghazal of Saheb - kahan khush dekh paati he kisi ko bhi kabhi duniyaasukun main dekhakar hamako na kar le khudakushi duniyajo paisa ho, to sab apane na ho to sab paraaye hanzara si umr main hi maine yaaro dekh lee duniya • * * * * * * *ye ghaaton par ghaaten dekho / qismat kii saugaaten dekho dharti ko jananath kar denge / makkaaron kii baaten dekho The beautiful point of Urdu to Hindi ghazal at which 'lonely' stands, is the only thing to keep his name alive for centuries, but there is another one present with this gift that he is so close to all the conditions of his times
 Seeing as if today's era is staring at them and they are standing eye to eye
 ‘akelaa’ sahab shaayari ke saath takallufaat nahin baratate balki har wo sachhee baat jere-kalam le aate hai jo aaj ke samaaj kii sahi manzarkashi kar sake
 See some examples- rishte aate kahan hai uske lieladka acha he par kamata nahin• * * * * * ja gavaahon pe kuch kharch kar or bedaag ho ja bariek kathari mayssar he bas wo hi chadar he wo hi dari • * * * * * are chuuhe tu daawey lakh kar lekin yahi sach he gale main billiyon ke ghantiyaan pahana nahin saktaa• * * * * * * *janata kii taqalifein sunne kaa ye dhang niraala he dekho baithe hai sahab ji rooyee thunse kaan main • * * * * * * *in tamaam sharon main aaj sheron main aaj kii kadavi sachchaiyon ko belaag tareeqe se kaha gaya he
 Virendra Khare 'lonely' ghazals, apart from these enlarged ones, have many other aspects that touch the heart, sometimes moisten the eyes, sometimes bring smiles to the lips, sometimes the brain shrugs, sometimes by patting them on the back Encourages ye ek mufatsar sa firruf tha ‘akelaa’ kii gazalon kaa
 'akela' has not only tried ghazals, but has also tried various genres of Hindi shayari of the current era and has shown in every field of Jauhar literature of his pen like a fun player
 yun lagata he jaise alfaaz, ahsaas, shaur or inke saath lafzon ke khel par ‘akelaa’ ji ko puri tarah dastaras hasil he
 Whatever genre he touched, he took it to paia-e-takmil
 ‘akelaa' ke geet or azaad nazmen is baat kii pukhta gavaah hai
 In the lyrics of 'akela' and in the free nazams, there is an ace of truth which is sometimes sharp and sometimes soft on the situation and society
 yahi vajah he ki har shaks unhen padhakar sochane par majaboor ho jaataa he shaayad isi liye aaj ‘akelaa’ ke geet or kavitaayen hazaron dilon kii dhadkan ban gayi hai
 See an example from the song and Azad Nazam - Bhishma Pitamah makes regular vows Bhangadharmaraj often appears to renounce the evil policy of unrighteousness; hamaare paathyakram main / shaamil he / ek bahut chota sa paath komalta par / or chalati he / ek puri kitaab / nishthurataa sikhaane vaali / It is clear from these examples that 'akela' enjoys the ghazals like songs and the land of Azad nazams
 asl baat ye he jaisaa ki iqbaal ne kaha he-“dil se jo baat nikalati he asar rakhti he
 "'alone' is a true man
 He thinks, speaks and writes anything with full truth and truth leaves an impact
" ab ye sachai chaahe ek garib aadmi kii rozi roti jutaney ke liye dar dar bhatakane kii ho, chaahe rajanetaaon ke pakhandon ke khilaaf ho yaa phir maujuuda chaupat vyavastha ko badalane kii koshishon kii shakl main ho
 However, the truth only leaves its light and the presence of this truth has given the poetry of 'lonely' a shining that draws people to themselves
 rajanetaaon ke tathakthith badppan kii ye sachai kya khub he-“aatmakathy unche hai boni kerani he / aise main kuch haalat kahan sudharani he
 In giving the dietary phase to the Lord / Say, how is Ahilya Tarni? chalani main jal bharne kaa prahasan jari / ye dukhade pratibandhit honge to kaise
 This statement of truth is also not less - two money two to four proved to be unfortunate on the nine sixty-nine who have chosen the foreword is from new, old disciplines
 ‘akelaa’ kii rachanaaon kii maqbooliyat kaa raaj ek or bhi he or wo ye he ki unki rachanaaon ko na to aajkal ke kavy manchon kii foohadataa kaa rog lag paaya he or na tathakthith shuddh saahitiyik kheme kii ati bauddhikta hi un par haaavee ho paayi he
 He has saved the poem from being a rare species of creature by presenting it in its natural form
 aap sabhi jaanate hai ki aajkal hindi kavita ek aise durdasha ke daur se guzar rahi he jaise koi shahzaadi kisi jangal main apana rasta bhatak gai ho
 On one hand, it is the poetry of the stage which has nothing to do with literature
 jo bhadde chutkulon or starhin rachanaaon ke zariye public ko bevakoof bana kar paisa batorne kii hode main juty he jaisaa ki khud ‘akelaa’ ne kaha he-“ betuke bhadde latife, karnpriy tukbandiyaan / manchvaalon kii nazar main shaayari itani hi thi
 "and on the other hand, in the name of pure literature, there are compositions of those creators, which in solving our problems may be left alone or whose words can be understood by all but sweat to make meaning
 aise main ‘akelaa’ ne jis sadhe hue zahan ke saath janata kii baat janata kii zabaan main puri kaavyatmakataa kaa nirvaah karte hue jis tareeqe se kalamband kii he, vahi unki khaasiyat ban gayi
 And this is the reason why the poetry of 'akela' is gaining the same popularity in literary seminars and forums
 jahaan kahin bhi manch par ‘akelaa’ jate hai to bas chaa jate hai or is baat ko sabit kar dete hai ki acchhee shaayari bhi manch par suni jaati he
 It is a different matter that they are less visible on the forums
 darasal manchon kaa apana ek system he- ‘give in tech’ kaa system ki agar kisi kavi ko manchon tak janaa he to pehle use koi manch daalana hoga, phir wo jin kaviyon ko bulaaegaa, badale main wo kavi use bula lenge or jo pement wo unhen degaa vahi pement use bulaakar lautaa diya jaayegaa
 It is not advisable in the 'lonely' to hold the ear with such a hand
 ‘akelaa’ kii azaad nazmen bhi bahut acchhee hai azaad nazmen likhnaa bada mushkil fan he
 It is further said that nowadays people have accepted this as a shortcut and a large crowd of free verse writers has gathered
 inamen kuch to wo hai jo chhandabaddh likhane main naakaami ke baad chand mukt par utar aaye or kuch wo hai jinhen kavi ban kar buddhijivi kahalaane kaa shauq chadha to is vidha kaa sahaara le liya or samajha chalo acha he ki isamen na rules hai na regaullation, free style game he
 But it is not so
 chand mukt rachanaayen vahi behatar likh saktaa he jise chhandabaddh rachanaaon par ubur hasil ho
 Just like a good driver who knows how to drive efficiently on a full road and follows all the rules of traffic, if he ever needs to drive on fields, barns, footpaths, hills, then better driving fun
 Trying on, the car will run in such a way that the car does not have a plight, do not break hands and feet in the accident and the right safe floor can also be reached
 ‘akelaa’ shaayari ke traffic ke puure rule se vaaqif hai
 Seeing the red, green, yellow light of his pen car runs the same way, his hands do not get carried away in the forests and regas
 in par bashir badr kaa ye sher puri tarah khara utarataa he ki-“ ham bhi dariyaa hai hamen apana hunar maaloom he jis taraf bhi chal padenge rasta ho jaayegaa
 " bhai virendra khare ne jab apana tabllus ‘akelaa’ rakhaa hoga tab na jane kya khyaal inke zahan main rahaa hoga
 Even if this journey of his had started alone, but today people have not let this 'lonely' be alone but a crowd is with him
 ‘akelaa’ ke liye ye kahana haq-ba-jaanib hoga ki-“ main akelaa hi chalaa tha jaanibe-manzil magarlog saath aate gayi or kaaravaan banataa gaya
 "my prayers are that Allah Virendra Khare should give more trouble to the pen of 'lonely' and become such rich of the pen so that it will be remembered for centuries
 'ana' qaasamihindi ghazal or geet ke kshetra main yuva kavi virendra khare ‘akelaa’ kaa naam bahut janaa pahachaanaa he
 In Bundelkhand, the lonely 'dushyant Kumar' alone has carried forward Dushyant Kumar's ghazal tradition by saying Hindi ghazals that are able to affirm the sufferings and pains of the common people, as per his original image, as well as the traditional Hindi song genre
 It has also done a commendable job of giving a new omnibus form to the world in terms of story and craft
 ‘akelaa’ kii yah duusari kriti unki saahitiyik pratishtha ko or pukhtagi degi, aisa meraa vishwaas he

 The transaction process is "offline" when the cardholder chooses "credit"
 bikri ke samay, koi vyapaaree anugna praapt karne ke liye card ko sansaadhit kar saktaa he yaa nahin bhi kar saktaa he
 a license is a guarantee through which the merchant will be paid the amount
 In a normal credit card transaction, the amount is not withdrawn from the cardholder's account until the merchant has settled all the transactions on his or her credit card, after which the cardholder's checking account is asked for payment against the purchase amount

 Debit cards do not usually have such features and therefore a very small amount is set by merchants as a fee to accept debit cards, no matter the transaction amount
 For very small amounts, it is far cheaper for merchants to accept debit cards than credit cards

 In the US, Eftpos is a worldwide debit
 ek hi interbank network he jo atm network ke saath POS sanchalit network ko bhi sanchalit karata he
 Most interbank networks, such as Pulse, NYCE, MAC, Tyme, SHAZAM, STAR, etc
 are regional and not interconnected; However, most ATM / POS networks have agreements to accept each other's cards
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ek network dwaara jari card vishisht taur par kahin bhi kaam karata he, ve bhugtan ke liye ATM / POS cardon ko sweekaar karte hai

 However, since credit costs are higher for merchants, many terminals have made it more difficult to obtain credit functions in PIN accepting merchant locations

 An additional problem with the use of debit cards in the US is their voluntary use in gas pumps
 graahak debit card par eendhan khareednaa chaah saktaa he, lekin pump computer nahin jaanata he ki graahak ko kitna eendhan chahie
 The pump is activated when the customer presents his card on the card reader and inserts a PIN
 isi bindu par pump eendhan daalata he, haalanki bikri kaa lenden puraa nahin hota he
 There is no way to know how much fuel was sold at the pump, nor how much money is available in the customer's debit account
 kisi saamaanya bikr lenden main, koshish yahi kii jaati he ki aapke khate main jitna he usase kahin adhik paise kharch kar die jaaen, iskaa nateeja yah hoga ki "no cell" alert vyapaaree ko de diya jayega or tab bikri nahin hoti he
 At the volunteer fuel pump, the fuel reaches the customer's tank already, then the bank is able to know the total cost of the sale
 yahaan is samasya ke kai samaadhaan hai, jaise ki jab khate main 10 dollar se kam rakam he to 1 dollar kii purv anujyapti nakaar diya jaataa he, lekin phir bhi ek khaas rakam ke lenden kii anumati milti he, lekin bikri ke evaj main lenden se pehle vyapaarik maal kaa vitaran kar dena debit card pranali ke liye vipatti he
 Sometimes the commission is so high that the gas station sometimes gets lost when someone pays for the gas with credit
 1980 ke dashak main jab pump main bhugtan kii shuruuaat hui tab bahut saare gas steshnon ne nakad bhugtan ke liye chhot dene kii prastaav diya tha
 Most of them stopped doing so as the rebate did not significantly increase their cash sales

 It is used by some banks to withdraw their fsas, msas as well as hsas
 isamen visa yaa mastercard logo hota he, lekin iskaa upyog debit card kii tarah nahin kiya ja saktaa, keval credit card kii tarah kiya ja saktaa he or har vyapaaree jo debit or credit card sweekaar karata he, ise sweekaar nahin karata he, par keval unheen ke dwaara sweekaar kiya jaataa he jo ennee debit card sweekaar karte hai

 a small but growing business segment of debit cards in the US is associated with accessing tax-support cost accounts such as flexible spending accounts, health reimbursement accounts and health saving accounts
 inamen se zyaadaatar debit card chikitsa vyay ke liye hai, haalanki kuch ashriton kii dekhbhaal or parivahan kharch ke liye jari kiye jate hai
 Traditionally, fsas are only used to claim reimbursement after loss and often pay out-of-pocket expenses, often when the amount is deducted from an employee's salary check
 is dohari giravat se bachane ke liye sateek or lekha-pareekshan yogya kar vivarani ke liye prativedan ke jariye chikitsa ke liye fsas or hras internal revenue sarvice dwaara anumodith akelaa tarika he
 The details of the debit card say, for medical use only, are invalid for various reasons: the merchant and the issuing bank have no way other than to decide as soon as possible whether the entire purchase is eligible for the customer's tax benefit type ; No way for customers to know as soon as possible; Often he makes a mixed purchase with need and convenience and can easily make mistakes; The additional contractual clause between the customer and the issuing banks would alter the payment processing standards, creating additional confusion
 yogya kharidadari ke liye card kaa vishesh istemaal graahakon ke liye suvidhajanak ho saktaa he, lekin vastav main card kaa istemaal kaise ho, isse kuch lenadena nahin
 If the bank rejects the transaction due to the drug store not being recognized, it would be damaging and confusing for the cardholders
 sanyukt rajya america main sabhi chikitsa seva yaa aapurti bhandar sateek soochna uplabdh karaane samarth nahin hote hai, isliye debit card jari karanevaale sabhi lenden ko maanya kar sakate hai, agar khaarij ho gaya yaa kagaji karrwai niyamon ko santusht karne main paryaapt nahin paaya gaya to carddharakon ko prapatr manuali bhej diya ja saktaa he

 isi avasar par yojit ek sammaan samaaroh main panini anand ne unase khaas baatcheet kii
 Here are some major excerpts of this conversation
 jivan ke 75 basant paar karke aaj kaisaa anubhav kar rahe hai? It is a very beautiful feeling but there is also the misery of not having many people
 khaaskar un logon ke bichhudane kaa, jinase sikhkar or jinke sanidhya se hi aaj is mukaam tak pahunchaa hoon
 You have a huge contribution in the field of music
 aaj is avasthaa tak aakar aap ko kya lagata he, jivan main sangeet yatra kahan tak pahaunchi he? Many a times it happens that i start searching for singing vocals, i am searching to find a note from somewhere
 On that day people say that you have seen God today
 yah kah paanaa bahut kathin he ki kitni saansen leni hai, kitne kaarykram karne hai
 i do not believe that i have any contribution in the field of music
 main kahan gaata hoon
 i have done nothing
 main to keval madhyam maatr hoon
 All is the grace of God and my brother and love of people
 kai baar aisa hota he ki gaate-gaate swaron ko khojane lagata hoon, dhundne lagata hoon ki kahin se koi sur mil jaae
 us din log kehete hai ki aapane to aaj ishwar ke darshan kara die or jis din mujhe lagata he ki maine bahut acha gaaya, koi puch baithta he, pandit ji, aaj kya ho gaya tha
 But yes, i believe that every artist, who was born and made a place in this country, has a big contribution to music
 ye yogadan to log hi sahi-sahi bataa sakate hai
 The artist does not know his contribution
 aaj shastreey sangeet ko lekar kai tarah ke prayog ho rahe hai
 Many artists are releasing their albums
 ise kis rup main dekha jaae? From my point of view it is not the subject of any big debate
 nae kalakaaron ne apane str par mehnat karke apni jagah banaai he or aaj ek badi sankhya aise kalakaaron ko sun rahi he
 Many artists have increased the spread of classical music through their work and people around the world are listening to them, this is a positive sign
