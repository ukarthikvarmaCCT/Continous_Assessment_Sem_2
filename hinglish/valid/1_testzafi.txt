 The Maheshwar Sutra is considered to be the basis of Sanskrit grammar
 panini ne sanskrit bhashaa ke tatkaaleen swaroop ko parishkrut evam niyamit karne ke uddeshy se bhashaa ke vibhinn avyavon evam ghatakon yatha dhwani-vibhaag, naam, pad, aakhyaat, kriya, upsarg, avyay, vaakya, ling ityadi tathaa unke antarsambandhon kaa samavesh ashtaadhi main kiya he
 Ashtadhyayi has 32 footers which are equally divided into eight chapters
 vyakaran ke is mahneey granth me panini ne vibhakti-pradhan sanskrit bhashaa ke vishaal kalevar kaa samgr evam sampoorn vivechan lagbhag 4000 sutron main kiya he, jo aath adhyyon main vibhajit hai
 Keeping in mind the misbehavior of writing material in the society then, Panini has taken the help of sutra style to make the grammar memorable
 punah, vivechan ko atishay sankshipt banane hetu panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se praapt upkarnon ke saath-saath swayan bhi anek upkarnon kaa prayog kiya he jiname shivasutra yaa maheshwar sutara sabase mahatvapurn hai
 The origin of the Maheshwar Sutras is attributed to the Tandava dance performed by Lord Nataraja
 arthath:-"nrity ke avsaan par nataraj ne sanakaadi rishiyon kii siddhi or kaamana kaa uddhaar ke liye navpanch baar damru bajaayaa
 In this way, this web of fourteen Shivasutras appeared
 " Playing the fourteen times of Damru produced sounds in the form of fourteen sutras, the grammar was revealed by these sounds
 isaliye vyakaran sutron ke aadi-pravartak bhagwaan nataraj ko mana jaataa he
 Fame is that Maharishi Panini received these sutras with the blessings of Devadhidev Shiva which formed the basis of Paninian Sanskrit grammar

 The 14 sutras mentioned above combine the characters of the Sanskrit language in a specific way
 faltah, panini ko shabdon ke nirvachan yaa niyamon me jab bhi kinhi vishesh varna samoohon ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ve un varnon ko maheshwar sutron se pratyaahaar banaakar sankshep me grahan karte hai
 Maheshwar Sutras are also called ‘pratyahar mlas’ Sutras for this reason
 pratyaahaar banane kii vidhi tathaa sanskrit vyakaran me unke bahuvidh prayogon ko aage darshaya gaya he
 In these 14 sutras all the characters of Sanskrit language have been included
 pratham 4 sutron main swar varnon tathaa shesh 10 sutara vyanjan varnon kii gananaa kii gayi he
 In short, vowels are called good and consonant letters are called hal
 ach evam hal bhi pratyaahaar hai
 Pratyahara means short statement
 ashtaadhi ke pratham adhyay ke pratham paad ke 71wein sutara ‘adirantyen saheta’ sutara dwaara pratyaahaar banane kii vidhi kaa panini ne nirdesh kiya he
 Adirantyen Saheta: The Adi Varna creates a pratyahar with the last Varna Varna, which gives a comprehensive understanding of the Adi Varna and the pre-conscious Varna Varna
 udhaaharan: ach = pratham maheshwar sutara ‘aiun’ ke aadi varna ‘a’ ko chaturth sutara ‘aiuch’ ke antim varna ‘ch’ se yoga karaane par ach pratyaahaar banataa he
 This good pratyahar makes sense of all the letters from its initial letter 'A' to the one who comes before it
 atah, Ach = ae u ॠ ॡ a a o o
 isi tarah hal pratyaahaar kii siddhi 5wein sutara haywarat ke aadi akshar ha ko antim 14 wein sutara hal ke antim akshar l ke saath milaane se hoti he
 As a result, uparyukt sabhi 14 sutron main antim varna ko panini ne it kii sangya di he
 Since it is a noun, these last characters are used only for contract to make pratyahar, but they are not counted in the grammatical process i

 But if it is to keep the height limited, then it becomes compulsory to shield both
 aisi chhaton ke liye kainchiyan lagaai jaati hai
 Small pallet canes are made of wood and the larger ones are of iron, or mixed with wood and iron
 lakdi dabaav ke avyavon ke liye or loha tanaav ke avyavon ke liye vishesh upyukt hota he
 In iron scissors, one or more angles, tees, channels or eye sections are used for pressure components
 tanaav ke avyavon main inke atirikt pattee yaa chaden bhi lagaai ja sakati hai
 The expansion of these components is kept somewhat larger than required, so that there is scope for holes in the rivets
 kainchiyon kii banaavat paat ke anusaar hi hoti he
 Their main parts are three: yathasambhav bhaar jodon ke upar hi aane diya jaataa he, taaki avyavon main sidhaa dabaav yaa tanaav hi pade, aadaa nahin
 If there is a load in between the joints, then those components have to be kept very thick for crosswise stress
 kanchi kaa sabase sada udhaaharan yugmit kadiyaan hai
 If the bridge is slightly higher, the bottom ends of these links have a greater tendency to spread outward

 yadi yah taan bilkul neeche na lagaakar kuch oonchaai par, kadiyon ke lagbhag aadhe par, lagaai jaae, to collar kehalaati he
 The height of the room under the collar scissors is slightly more and wood is also saved, but it requires great care in its use due to the salting of the main links and the piling on the walls

 This type of scissors is called male thanma scissors

 More pouches have many pauses and stitches as required
 inaki anek akritiyaan hai, jo 'phinc' kanchi, 'hov' kanchi, 'praat' kanchi, 'warren' kanchi aadi ke naam se vikhyath hai
 If both the main links of the scissors are uneven, one side of the shield is absolutely vertical, then it is called aristocratic scissors
 aisi kaichiyan praaia: kaarkaanon main, yaa bade bade shedon main, lagati hai or khadi dhaal kii ore sheesha yaa plastic lagaaya jaataa he, taaki andar prakaash pahunch sake
 This steep gradient is usually kept towards the north, so that the light reaches inside but not the sun
 in kainchiyon ko isiliye utari prakaash kanchi bhi kehete hai
 The principle of scissors is that the frame be divided into triangles as much as possible because the length of the sides of the triangle does not change if its shape does not change, while the shape of the quadrilateral or the longer sides, while the length of the arms remain unchanged, is affected by the stress on its angle
 And consequently, the shape changes, such that a rectangle can become a parallelogram and square rhombus
 jis maadaa-thambha-kanchi main ek chaturbhuj hota he, vah apurna kanchi he
 Likewise, paired links and collar scissors are also incomplete

 kisi bhugolic kshetra yaa jan samooh par satta yaa prabhutv ke sampoorn niyantran par anany adhikaar ko samprabhutaa kaha jaataa he
 The sovereign is the highest lawmaker and controller, that is, sovereignty is the supreme power of the state
 europe main aadhunik rajya ke udai ke parinamswaroop satrahavin sadi main 'samprabhutaa' kii avadharana kaa janm hua
 In European Europe, the power in European kingdoms and empires was divided between the king, the pope and the feudal lords
 pandrahavin or solahavin sadi main samantvaad ke tirohit hone or udhar protestant mat ke ubhaar ke kaaran catholic carch kii manyata main hraas hone se samprabhu rajyon ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Sovereignty means 'total and unlimited power'
 lekin iske nihitarth itane sahaj nahin hai
 Just by this meaning it is not known what is involved in the structure of this entire power
 Does it mean any supreme statutory authority or is it related to a political power that cannot be challenged? samprabhutaa ke arth sambandhi isi tarah ke vivaadon ke kaaran unnisvin sadi se hi ise do bhaagon main baant kar samajha jaataa rahaa he : vidhik samprabhutaa or raajnneetik samprabhutaa
 This concept is also practically accepted as internal sovereignty and external sovereignty
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik sanskaran kaa matlab he rajya ke bheetar hone vaale satta ke bantwaare main yani raajnneetik pranali ke bheetar sarvocch satta kaa mukaam
 External version refers to the ability of the state to remain active as an independent and autonomous entity under the international system
 samprabhutaa kii avadharana aadhunik raashtra or rashtrawaad ke aadhaar main bhi nihit he
 Without the mixed influence of ideas of national independence, self-rule and sovereignty, one cannot imagine the process of de-colonization under which new nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America grew up largely after World War II
 Was created vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke bich antar kaa ek bauddhik itihaas he jise samajhane ke liye jyaan bodaan or thomas hobbs ke tatsambandhit matbhedon par nazar daalani hogi
 Bodan, in his work The Six Books of Commonwealth, argues in favor of a sovereign who makes laws himself, but places himself above those laws
 is vichaar ke mutabik kanoon kaa arth he logon ko samprabhu ke aadesh par chalaanaa
 This does not mean that Boda wanted to advocate an autocratic ruler here
 unki manyata thi ki kanoon banane or unka anupaalan karaane vaala samprabhu shaasha ek ucchtar kanoon ke adheen rahegaa
 That is, the seal of divine law will be necessary on the authority of the temporal ruler
 bodaan ke is vichaar ke vipareet hobbs apni rachana levaythan main samprabhutaa ke vichaar kii vyakhya praadhikaar ke sandarbh main na karke satta ke sandarbh main karte hai
 Prior to Hobbes, St
 Augustine stressed the need for a sovereign who would control the moral evils inherent in humanity
 isi tark kaa or vikaas karte hue hobbs ne samprabhutaa ko damankaaree satta par ekadhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit karte hue sifaarish kii ki yah takat akele shaasha ke haath main honi chahie
 Although Hobbes preferred uninterrupted monarchy, he was also willing to believe that it could be in the hands of a small faction of rulers or a democratic assembly
 bodaan or hobbs ke bich kii yah bahes bataati he ki vidhik samprabhutaa rajya ke kanoon ko sarvopari maanane par tiki hui he
 In contrast, political sovereignty is linked to the actual distribution of power
 is fark ke baavjood yah bhi maananaa padegaa ki samprabhutaa kii vyaavhaarik dharna main vidhik pahalu bhi hote hai or raajnneetik bhi
 The sovereignty of modern states is also dependent on the supremacy of the law and on the power system that complies with the law, which has a repressive machinery
 koi bhi kanoon mahaz naitik baadhyataaon ke dam par lagu nahin hota
 It cannot be sustained without a system of punishment, police, jails and courts
 vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa kaa yah sameekaran donon taraf se kargar hota dikhaai detaa he
 If the law requires a system of power for its compliance, then the power requires the recommendation of the law for its legitimacy
 shashan ko kanoonsammat or samvidhansammat hona padataa he, tabhi uski vaidhata kaayam rah paati he
 Only dictatorial governments work on the basis of political sovereignty
 agar sarkaar loktantric he to uski damankaaree mashinari ko kanoon kii simaaon main rah kar adaalaton ke sammukh javabdeh rahanaa padataa he
 The question of the internal nature of sovereignty has been much debated in the realm of political theory
 akhir sarvocch or aseemit satta kaa mukaam kya hona chahie? kya use kisi ek shaasha ke haath main rakhaa janaa shreyaskar hoga yaa uskaa centre kisi pratinidhitvamoolak sanstha main nihit hona behatar hoga? satrahavin sadi main frans ke samraat lui chaudaaven ne darp se kaha tha ki main hi rajya hoon
 The rationale behind giving sovereignty in the hands of a person is that in that case sovereignty will be guaranteed to be inseparable
 uski abhivyakti ek hi awaz main hogi or usamen koi doosraa praadhikaar hastkshep nahin kar paayegaa
 Effective interference in this totalitarian notion of sovereignty was done in the eighteenth century when jean-jacques Rousseau introduced the concept of popular sovereignty
 ruso ne rajshahi kii hukumat ko kaarij karte hue apni rachana soshal kantrect main likhaa : ‘manushya swatantra paidaa hota he, par har jagah vah zanjiron main jakadaaa hua he
 In fact, the social contract gives a new form to modern political philosophy
 unka saamaajik samjhauta hobbs or lock ke saamaajik samjhaute se alag he
 Philosophers prior to Rousseau believed that humans are different from other beings because of their intellectual abilities, while Rousseau believes that humans are different because of their ability to make moral choices
 agar use yah chunaav karne kii azaadi na di jaae to vah das se adhik kuch nahin rah jayega
 Since society is full of various freedoms, and man cannot return to the early world of his natural freedom, Rousseau suggests that he should exchange that freedom with civil liberties
 iske liye manushya ko ek-duusare se mil kar sanghathan bananaa hoga, saamaajik astitv rachana hoga jiske tahat sabhi log apane adhikaar tyaag denge or badale main naagarik ke rup main adhikaar praapt karenge, ek samprabhu ke sadsy ke rup main rahenge
 That is, a constitution will have to be made, under which every person will be subject and also a participating citizen
 keval isi tarah swatantraaa kii guarantee kii ja sakegi
 This was the concept of democracy, but the Russo did not agree with democracy or law-making run by the representatives of the people
 pracheen yunaan ke pratyaksh loktantr kii tarah ruso chaahate the ki sabhi naagarik ek saarvajanik sthaan par jamaa ho kar vidhi nirmaan karen
 To save the minority from being subject to the decision taken by the majority, Rousseau favored a consensus which formulated his most well-known principle 'public will' to make it effective
 ‘jan-ichha’ ke aadhaar par rache gayi kanoon ke paalan kaa matlab tha swayan apni ichha kaa paalan karnaa
 The principle of 'public will' introduced by Russo later became the basis of modern democratic theory
 ruso ne aise nagarikon ke sahaj samudaay kalpana kii thi jo oonch- neech ke sambandhon se pare samanta or ekta ke vaahak honge, isliye unhen vishwaas tha ki unke bich main ‘jan-ichha’ uplabdh karnaa aasaan hoga
 But Rousseau could never answer the question of how the 'journal-will' would come out of the wishes expressed in the general assembly of citizens
 isliye ant main ve yah kehete hue nazar aaye ki agar ‘jan- ichha’ nahin uplabdh ho paa rahi he to bahumat kii ichha ko hi uskaa paryaay maan liya janaa chahie
 The principle of sovereignty has also been taken up by the advocates of liberal-democratic thought
 unka kahana he ki bahultavaadi or loktantric shashan ke sandarbh main samprabhutaa kii dharna anaavashyak he
 These people consider the idea of sovereignty as suffering from its totalitarian past and therefore undesirable
 unka kahana he ki loktantric sarkarein damankaaree mashinari dwaara thope jane vaale kathith rup se vidhisammat shashan dwaara nahin chalatin
 They rule through an equation of control and balance and a network based on it
 darasal, sanghatmak charitra vaale aadhunik rajyon main aantarik samprabhutaa kaa centre tay karnaa bahut mushkil he
 In federal states such as the United States, Canada, Australia and India, the government is divided into two levels and each level has its own autonomous powers
 is prakaar ke rajyon main samprabhutaa centre or paridhi ke bich saajhedaari ke rup main ubhartee he
 In such a situation, if there is an undivided sovereign then it is the constitution which makes the center also sovereign and the states as well
 bahya samprabhutaa antarrashtriya vyavastha main kisi rajya kii haisiyat kii dyotak he
 There are also situations that the internal sovereignty of a state continues to be disputed, but its external sovereignty is respected in the international arena
 vaise bhi loktantron ke yug main aantarik samprabhutaa ke masale ab itane zyaada ahm nahin maane jate, par bahya samprabhutaa kaa prashn pehle se kahin zyaada mahatvapurn ho chukaa he
 There are many international disputes in which the claim of sovereignty of one country is seen as a challenge to its sovereignty from another country
 philistiniyon dwaara apane samprabhu raashtra ke liye chalaaya jane vaala andolan isroyal ko apni samprabhutaa ke kshay kaa kaarak lagata he

 The temperature drops and falls a lot
 dopaher main aksar 30 °centegrade se zyaada garmi hoti he jabaki praatkaal main shunaya ke aasapaas ja saktaa he
 It is common to fog in the morning

 Wheat and fruit cultivation goes on in Asir and this has expanded due to good irrigation in modern times
 aseer praant 6 zilon main banta hua he: The people of Asir province are descendants of tribes settled in this area from ancient times
 inamen 'aseer' yaa 'asaryah' naamak qabeelian parisangh shaamil he jinke naam par puure kshetra kaa naam padaa he
 Apart from these, Qathan, Bariq / Bareg, Bal-garn, Shaharan, Bani city, Rizal Alma, Rizal al-hazr, bal-asmar, bal-ahmar and other tribes also settle here
 yahan ke log aapas main arabi bhashaa kii kuch pracheen upbhashaayen bolte hai
 The people of Asir are divided into three factions according to their habitat: the 'sarat' clan of the higher plateau, the Tihamah clan and the Badiyah clan settled in the eastern desert region
 bahut se bade qabeelon main saraat, tihamah or badiyah shakhaayen hoti hai
 The manner of settlers in the hill areas resembles those of the Najd region
 aseer kii aabo-hawa or samskruti padosi yaman jaisi he
 Tribal customs are strictly followed in the society here, although the religious tradition here is not considered as strict as the Najd area
 yaman kii tarah yahan bhi baari barish hoti he isliye is ilaake ke ghar va anya nirmaan yaman kii tarah dikhte hai
 This region is also different from the rest of Saudi Arabia because the mineral of oil has not been extracted, which has not modernized the city-settlements here as seen in other parts of Saudi Arabia

 ek kaalpanik sankhya ek sankhya he jise vaastavik sankhya ko kaalpanik ikai i { \ displaystyle i} guna ke rup main likhaa jaataa he, jo iske gundharm i 2 = − 1 { \ displaystyle i^{2}=-1} dwaara paribhaashit kiya he
 The square of an imaginary number is zero or negative
 udhaaharan ke liye 5 i { \ displaystyle 5i} ek kaalpanik sankhya he jiskaa varg − 25 { \ displaystyle -25} he
 Adding the imaginary number bi { \ displaystyle bi} to a real number a { \ displaystyle a} gives the complex number a + bi { \ displaystyle a + bi}, where a { \ displaystyle a} and b { \ displaystyle b} } Are the real part and the imaginary part respectively of the complex number
 atah kaalpanik sankhya us sammishra sankhya ko bhi kaha ja saktaa he jiskaa vaastavik bhaag shunya he
 However, the Greek mathematician and engineer Hero of Alexandria was the first to achieve this number
 kaalpanik sankhyaon ko vyapak rup se sweekruti oiler or gaus ke kaary ke mili
 Geometric significance was first described by Casper Vessel by the plane points of complex numbers
 jyamitiya rup se, kaalpanik sankhyaayein sammishra tal kii urdhv aksh par rakhi jaati hai
 The importance of imaginary numbers begins with the creation of unrealistic numbers from complex numbers which are essential materials for scientific and related fields such as signal processing, control theory, electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, cartography and pulsing analysis

 Engineering produces physical goods and services; Develops and controls industrial processes
 iske liye vah takneekee maanakon kaa prayog karte hue vidhiyaan, dizin or vinirdesh pradaan karti he
 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ingénierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'
 nikat bhootkaal main abhiyantriki shabd kaa jo arth kosh main miltaa tha vah sankshep main is prakaar bataaya ja saktaa he ki But this limited definition could no longer run
 abhiyantriki shabd kaa arth ab ek ore nabhikeey abhiyantriki ke ucch vaigyanik or pravidhik kshetra se lekar maanviya gunon se sambandhit vishyon, jaise shramik niyantran prabandheey kaaryakshmata, samay or gati kaa adhyayan ityadi, anek praayogic vigyaanon ke vistrut kshetra ko ghere hue he
 Thus it would be more appropriate to define engineering as "it is the science and art of efficient use of natural means for the physical service of man"

 The uninterrupted inspection of both experimental and natural phenomena and the careful use of the fruits of this type of inspection on engineering problems in such a way that the minimum expenditure of time and money gives maximum service to the society is the major method of engineering
 shuddh vaigyanik abhiyantriki kii ulajhanon ko sulajhane kii reeti vaigyanik chaahe khoj paae hon yaa na paae hon, abhiyantaa ko to apana kaary puraa karnaa hi hoga
 In such a situation, the engineer resorts to experimental analysis to some extent and finds a solution that can work in a way that, while properly managing the defense, can make his daily problems solvable
 jais-jaise sambandhit vaigyanik ansh kaa uskaa gyaan achook hota jaataa he, vah raksha ke prabandh main kami karke vyay bhi gata saktaa he
 The intellectual and functional consideration of the problems has also enabled the engineer to enter into those fields which are believed to be concerned with scientist, doctor, economist, manager, humanistic science and art from the beginning
 vishwa kaa itihaas abhiyantriki ke romance kii kahani se bharaa padaa he
 In India and abroad, visionary and determined people have done important tasks by staking everything in accordance with their dreams
 prayek abhiyantric abhiyaan main tatsambandhi vishesh samasyaayen rahati hai or inako hal karne main choti-badi donon prakaar kii pratibhaaon ko avasar miltaa he
 Engineering is an applied science
 ejiniyari main karypranali kaa mahatv pehle se he kintu ab yah or bhi adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 As a result, 'systems engineering', 'knowledge engineering' etc
 have been born
 mote taur par kisi bhi ejeeniyar ko do baaten samajni hotin hai - Keeping in mind the 'requirements' and restrictions, the engineer prepares specifications, drawings, quality control to manufacture the required goods or services
 praayah ejeeniyar ke paas ek se adhik hal hote hai
 He considers diverse options
 vah vikalpon ko takneekee, aarthik tathaa suraksha kii drushti se moolyankan karata he or jo sarvaadhik upyukt parinaam detaa he use chun liya jaataa he
 Engineer work is very challenging
 galat hal kaa parinaam bahut mahangaa yaa bahut khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why often an engineer tests and analyzes a solution before implementing it
 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem

 On both sides of the stairway in the east direction are frightening and powerful statues of Gajardulas

 In other developed temples of Orissa, Natamandap and Bhogamandir were also built on the same axis, which made the building taller

 madhyahn rekha se prarambh hokar ye purv kii ore jaati he: Pandit Banarsidas Chaturvedi was a famous Hindi writer and journalist
 ve rajyasabha ke saansad bhi rahe
 In his editorship, a Hindi monthly called 'vishal Bharat' came out from Kolkata in Hindi
 pan banarsidas chaturvedi jaise sudhi chintak ne hi saakshaatkaar kii vidha ko pushpit evam pallavit karne ke liye sarvapratham sarthak kadam badhaayaa tha
 He was awarded the Padma Bhushan for his literary services
 ve apane samay kaa agraganya sampadak the tathaa apni vishisht or swatantra vritti ke liye jane jate hai
 There was no one in the entire Hindi literature as a reward for the memory of martyrs like him and for opposing cinematography
 unki smriti main banarsidas chaturvedi sammaan diya jaataa he
 It is said that he used to ask himself the same questions before joining any new social, cultural, literary or national campaign, joining hands in a new work or trending in a new work that he was asked about the country, society, its languages and literature, especially Will Hindi be good or will there be a reputation for higher values in any area of human life? san 1892 i main 24 disambar ko uttar pradesh ke firozabad main janme chaturvedi ji 1913 main inter kii pariksha paas karne ke baad paas hi sthit farrukhabad ke government hiskool main tees rupee masik vetan par adhyaaapak niyukt ho gaye
 But just a few months later, his mentor, Pandit Lakshmidhar Vajpayee, ordered him to leave his teaching and move to Agra and take over 'aryamitra'
 lakshmidhar ji un dinon agra se aryamitra nikaalte the
 In fact, Vajpayee was about to become the editor of his monthly 'navajivan' at the invitation of Dwarikaprasad Sevak and wanted to hand over 'aryamitra' to an editor who could live up to his confidence
 chaturvedi ji lakshmidhar vaajapeyi kii ajna shirodharya bhi kar lee thi, lekin isi bich unhen indaur ke us daily college main niyukti kaa aadesh mil gaya
 Chaturvedi ji was first in Indore Accompanied by Sampurnanand, who was a teacher in the same college, then Hindi Sahitya Sammelan was organized there, then the connection and contact of Mahatma Gandhi who came to preside over it gave new dimensions to his constantly restless service and creativity
 mahatma gandhi ne 1921 main gujarat viapeeth kii sthapana kii to unke aadesh par chaturvedi ji apni sevaayen arpit karne vahaan chale gaye
 Earlier, Gandhiji had collected the views of many mystics from across the country in the context of his campaign to make Chaturvedi as a national language, which was published as a booklet
 chaturvedi ji ne farrukhabad main apane adhyaapan kaal main hi totaaraam sanadhy ke liye unke sansmaranon kii pustak 'phiji dweep main mere 21 varsh' likh daali thi or tabhi 'aryamitra', 'bharat sudasha pravartak', 'navajivan' or 'maryaada' aadi us samay ke kai mahatvapurn patr-patrikaon main unke lekh aadi chhapane lage the
 The memoirs of 'my 21 Years in Fiji Island' were a very condescending depiction of the tragedy of migrant indentured laborers of India working under extremely harsh conditions on that island
 baad main chaturvedi ji ne sief andrus kii madhyam se in mazdooron kii durdasha kaa ant sunishchit karne ke liye bahuvidh praytn kiye
 According to Kaka Kalelkar, Chaturvedi's request to honor foreign mystics and human servants like Andrews in those days of nationalism was highly appreciated
 andrus ke nimantran par ve kuch dinon tak rabindranath thakur ke shanti niketan main bhi rahe the
 He called Andrews 'deenbandhu' and has also written a book in English on his personality and work with another author, whose role is written by Mahatma Gandhi
 lekin shikshan kaa kaam unhen is arth main katai raas nahin aa rahaa tha ki usamen tehraav bahut tha jabaki unki rachanaatmak pravriti ko har kadam par ek nai manzil kii talash rahati thi
 Finally one day he decided to take a leave from Gujarat Vidyapith and become a full-time journalist
 kolkata se prakashit masik ‘vishaal bharat’ ne unke sampadan main apana swarnakaal dekha
 At that time, only Birla will be a Hindi writer who has not aspired to see his works published in Vishal Bharat
 chaturvedi ji ke priy angrezi patr ‘modern rivyuu’ ke maalik or pratishthit patrkaar ramanand chattopadhyaay hi ‘vishaal bharat’ ke bhi maalik the
 He was convinced of Chaturvedi ji's editing skills and scholarship, and Chaturvedi ji also respected him a lot, but on occasions of editorial disagreement, what should be considered by Chaturvedi ji
 aise kai avasar charchit bhi hue
 Chaturvedi Ji considered Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi as the biggest inspiration in his journalistic life after Mahatma Gandhi, whose biography he has also written
 1930 main unhone orchha naresh veerasingh ju dev ke prastaav par tikamgarh jaakar ‘madhukar’ naam ke patr kaa sampadan kiya
 Naresh assured him of his uninterrupted and uninterrupted editorial rights but later found that Chaturvedi ji did not allow even 'courtiers' in the tune of making 'madhukar' the bearer of national consciousness and the pioneer of cultural revolution
 So he stopped publishing
 bharat ke swatantra hone ke pashchaat chaturvedi ji baarah varsh tak rajyasabha ke manonith sadsy rahe or 1973 main unhen padmabhushan se sammanit kiya gaya
 Before departing from this world on May 2, 1985, he wrote in his account 'literature and Life', 'sketch', 'memoirs', 'satyanarayana Kaviratna', 'bharatbhakta Andrews', 'keshav Chandra Sen', 'pravasi Bharatvasi', Compositions like 'indians in Fiji', 'fiji problems', 'our adorable' and 'sethubandha'
 unhone kai videshyatraaen kin or desh-videsh main anek saamaajik, saanskrithik va saahitiyik sansthaaon or pratibhaaon ke pushpan-pallavan main bhi vishisht yoga diya
 Popular author of the Indian Revolutionary Movement, Sudhir Vidyarthi, says that he got involved in the mission of protecting the revolutionaries only after being inspired by the 'freedom Struggle Warrant' of Agra's 'yuvak' monthly edited by Chaturvedi in 1972

 In nature, it is found exclusively in animals

 1% to 2% of muscle tissue is made up of collagen and 6% of the weight of strong, condyle muscles
 gelatin, jiskaa khaadya or udyog main prayog kiya jaataa he, colejan se vyutpann he
 Scientists could not understand the molecular and packing structures of collagen for decades; In the mid-1930s the first evidence was presented that they have a regular structure at the molecular level
 us samay se kai pramukh vidwaan, jinamein shaamil hai nobel puraskaar vijeta crik, poling, rich, yonath, broadski, burman or ramchandran jinhone colejan ekalak kii rachana par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Several competing models, however, led to the three-spiral "madras" model, behaving correctly in relation to the composition of each peptide chain, which provided an almost perfect molecular quaternary structure, although this model still required some refinement
 Were
 The packing structure of collagen was not defined to the same extent outside fibrous collagen types, although it has long been known to be hexagonal or semi-hexagonal
 Similar to its monolithic structure, several conflicting models specified that the panning arrangement of collagen molecules is either 'sheet-like' or microfibrillar
 recentlyhas confirmed that the microfibrillar structure described by Fraser, Miller, Wes was closest to the observed structure, although it greatly simplified the topological progression of adjacent collagen molecules and hence the discrete D-periodic quaternary arrangement, so to say, simply So: Could not predict the structure of the microcosm correctly
 tropocolejan yaa "colejan anu", tantu jaise bade colejan samucchy kii up-ikai he
 It is made up of three polypeptide fibers, approximately 300 nm and long and 1
5 nm in diameter, each consisting of a left-handed spiral structure
 These three left-handed spirals are twisted together into a right-handed coiled coil, a triple helix or "super helix", an associative quaternary structure strengthened by multiple hydrogen bonds
 tip i colejan ke saath or sabhi colejan nahin to, sambhawatah sabhi tantumay colejan, prayek tripal-heliks daaen haath ke super-super-coil main sambhddha hota he, jise colejan sookshmatantu ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Each microfibrils converge with their nearest microfibrils to the extent that they appear to be individually unstable although within the collagen fibers they are well organized, similar to crystals
 colejan kii ek suspasht visheshta he in colejan up-ikaayiyon kii teen shrinkhalaaon main prayek main amino acid kii niyamit vyavastha
 The sequence often follows the pattern of gly-pro-y or gly-x-hyp, where x and y may be any other various amino acid residues
 proline yaa hydroxiproline kul anukram kaa 1 / 6 gathit karte hai
 With glycine being 1 / 3 of the sequence, this means that approximately half of the collagen sequence is not glycine, proline, or hydroxyproline, a fact often not noted due to the abnormal GXY disposition of collagen alpha-peptides
 Such regular repeats and high glycine content are found only in some other fibrous proteins, such as silky fibrin
 75–80% of the silk is -gly-ala-gly-ala with 10% serine and elastin, which is rich in glycine, proline, and alanine, whose lateral group is the small inactive methyl group
 aise ucch glysine or niyamit doharaav, apane anukram ke bahut hi kam virgon ke sivaay, golakaar protein main kabhi nahin paae gaye
 Chemically-reactive lateral groups have not been required in structural proteins, since they have been in enzymes and transport proteins, however collagen is not just a structural protein
 koshika finotip, koshika aasanjan, utak viniman or buniyadi dhaanche ke nirdhaaran main uski mahatvapurn bhoomika ke kaaran, uske kai gaiyr proline samrudh kshetron ke kai virgon main koshika yaa matrix sahyog / viniman bhoomikaayen maujuud rahati he
 The relatively high content of proline and hydroxyproline, along with their geometrically carboxyl and amino groups, including rich amounts of glycine, are factors of the nature of spontaneous left-handed helix formation by individual polypeptide strands without intra-chain hydrogen bonds
 kyonki glysine bina parshv-shrinkhalaa ke choti emino acid he, yah tantumay sanrachanaatmak protein main ek adwitiya bhoomika nibhaati he
 In collagen, Gly is required in every third location, because the combination of the triple helix places this residue in the interior of the helix, where there is no room for a large lateral group other than the single hydrogen atom of glycine

 unhone mukhyadhara ke mahatvapurn raajnneetik dalon kii jati vyavastha ke unmoolan ke prati unki kathith udaseenta kii katu aalochana kii
 Ambedkar also criticized the Indian National Congress and its leader Mahatma Gandhi, accusing them of presenting the untouchable community as an object of compassion
 ambedkar british shashan kii vifaltaaon se bhi asantusht the, unhone achhut samudaay ke liye ek aisi alag raajnneetik pahchaan kii vakaalat kii jisame congress or british donon kii hi koi dakhal naa ho
 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya
 In 1942, Ambedkar rejected this agreement, 'state of Myanority' has also expressed Poona Pact's displeasure in this book

 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims

 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa

 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
