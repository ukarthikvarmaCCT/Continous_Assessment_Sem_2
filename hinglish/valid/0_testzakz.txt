 By this method, the female yucca ensures the production of flower seeds, because its eggs eat these seeds

 iskaa naam tulyakalika motor yaa sincronas motor is kaaran he kyonki iske roter kii ghurnan gati thik-thik utani hi hoti he jitani stater main nirmit ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii gati hoti he
 This motor is often not used to rotate a load, but is used to improve the power coefficient
 vishesh sthitiyon main iskaa upyog lod chalaane main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Synchronous speed, jahaan: The main parts of a synchronous motor are the stator and rotor
 isaki stater bhi preran motor ke samaan hi hoti he jis par teen-feji vinding kii gayi hoti he
 The magnetic field is generated either by a permanent magnet on the rotor or by giving DC to the electromagnets built on the rotor
 baahar se is disi ko roter par laane ke liye slip ring kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In large motors, a DC generator is placed on the same shaft
 isse praapt disi ko roter par bane vidyutchumbakon ko diya jaataa he
 Depending on the design, the rotor is of two types - tulykaalik motor ko 'over-iksite' karke chalaane par iske dwaara lee gayi dhara iske voltage se agragami hoti he
 On this basis, it can be used to increase the power coefficient
 isaki sabase acchhee baat yah he ki yadi lod kaa shakti-gunank parivartit ho rahaa ho to is motor kii field-viding kii dhara ko parivartit karke iske dwaara lee jane vaali dhara kaa shakti-gunank bhi is prakaar parivartit kiya ja saktaa he ki lod tathaa yah tulykaalik motor kaa sammilit shakti-gunank 1 ho jaay

 vaayu main mila jalawaashp sheethal padaarthon ke sampark main aane se sanghanan ke kaaran osank tak pahunchataa he
 When the temperature of the air falls below the dew point, then the water vapor starts falling on the surface in the form of water droplets or hail
 isi ko varsha kehete hai
 At any place, the amount of water received from the rainbows and snowflakes at a given time is called the measurement of rainfall there
 garmi ke kaaran utpann jalawaashp upar akaash main jaakar failata he evam thanda hota he
 Therefore, as the air rises, its ability to hold water vapor decreases
 yahan tak ki adhik upar uthne se vaayu kaa taap us ank tak pahunch jaataa he, jahaan vaayu jalawaashp dhaaran kar sakati he
 At even lower temperatures, the water vapor gets converted into watercourses
 isi se badalon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Then clouds rain down on the surface due to water
 jalakan banane ke uparaant bhi yadi vaayu kaa taap kam hote hote himank se bhi kam ho jaataa he, to jalakan himakanon kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai jisase himavarsha hoti he
 Two things are necessary for rain: varsha teen prakaar kii hoti he : The type of rainfall occurs in most equatorial regions, usually per day
 bumadhyarekha par adhik garmi padane se samudron se prachur maatra main jalawaashp banakar vaayu main mila karata he; garmi or vaashp ke kaaran ardra vaayu halki hokar upar uthati he or iskaa sthaan grahan karne ke liye anya hawaayen aati rahati hai
 The air cools up and spreads
 vaashp kii maatra adhik hone se osank tak pahunchane ke liye taap ko kam girnaa padataa he
 Hence, the vapor quickly takes the form of water and there is pouring rain usually after two o'clock every day
 is varsha ko sanvahneey varsha kehete hai
 When winds are blocked in the path of steam-laden winds, these winds have to rise, due to the effect of frozen snow on the mountains and as the air is cooled by the spread of air, the air vapor comes in the form of droplets on the ground
 ye hawaayen parvat ke duusari ore maidan main utarate hi garam ho jaati hai or aasapaas ke vaataavaran ko bhi garam kar detii he
 Similar rainfall occurs in most parts of the world
 monsooni pradeshon main bhi isi prakaar kii varsha hoti he
 This rain is called mountain rain
 is prakaar kii varsha garam or sheethal vayurasiyon ke aapas main milane se hoti he, kyonki halki garam vaayu upar uthati he tathaa baari sheethal vaayu neeche baithti he
 Therefore, the air rising up becomes cold and starts raining
 is prakaar varsha praaia: shitoshna katibandh main hua karti he
 An instrument is used to measure how much rainfall has occurred in a place, which is called a rainbow
 ise ek nishchit samay main tathaa nishchit sthaan par varsha main rakhkar pani ke barasane kii maatra ko maap liya jaataa he
 There are many types of rain gauge
 varsha adhiktar inch yaa centimetre main maapi jaati he
 a rain gauge is a hollow cylinder inside which a bottle is kept and a funnel rests on it
 varsha kaa pani keep dwaara bottle main bhar jaataa he tathaa baad main pani ko maapak dwaara maap liya jaataa he
 Keep this device in an open position, so that there is no obstruction in falling in the funnel of rain water

 Mangal Pandey is a soldier of Indian origin in the East India Company's army
 anglo-afgaan yudhon main ladate samay, vah apane british commanding afasar wiliam gordon ke jivan ko bachaata he
 Gordon is indebted to Pandey and a strong friendship develops between them, moving up from rank and race

 There is a spark of attraction between him and Pandey and a contact follows
 gordon or pandey kii dosti ko ek nai rifl kii shuruyaat ke baad chunauti di gai he: enfield raifald bandook afvaahen sipaahi ke bich failati hai, jo rifl ke liye powder or gend ko rakhe kaagazi kaartoos, suar vasa yaa gomance ke tonele ke saath yaa to geele hote hai
 The process of loading the rifle requires the soldier to cut down on the cartridge, and the soldiers believe that it will cause them to consume pork or beef - a disgusting act for Muslim and Hindu soldiers for religious reasons
 gordon is daawey kii jaanch karte hai, or unke varishton ne pandey or uske logon ko aashwaasan dene ke liye kaha he ki kaartoos pashu dooshit se mukt hai
 Demonstrating his faith in Gordon, Pandey cuts the cartridge, but the truth is discovered soon afterwards

 It turns out right, and Pandey married Heera in his prison cell when scenes of a nationwide revolt against British rule were shown
 iske parinamswaroop, gordon ko british raaj ke viruddh vidroh main shaamil hone ke rup main soochibaddh kiya gaya he

 In this context, the generalization of a learning instrument, after the experience of a set of learned data, to perform a new and unachievable example or task is called normalization

 Some device learning systems attempt to eliminate the need for human intuition in data analysis
 duusari pranaliyaan maanav or yantra ke bich ek sahyogi drushtikon apanaate hai
 However, human intuition cannot be completely lost because the designer of the system needs to specify how the data will be represented and what mechanisms will be used to discover the characterization of the data

 Compared to parliamentary debate, policy debate is more reliant on research evidence and involves a wider field of reasonable argument, which includes counter-planning, critical theory, and the theoretical standards of activity itself -dispute
 While the oratory is important and reflected in the "speaker's point" given to each disputant, the decision of each round is usually based on who "won" the argument based on the evidence and argument presented
 In addition, in certain areas of activity, disputants may increase "speed", to bring as much evidence and information as possible and respond to the other party
 People read at a rapid pace in an attempt to "mute" the opponent
 prabhaav main, vivadakarta kai vishyon par faili hui itani jaankaree prastut karata he, ki pratidwandvi ke paas sab kaa jawaab dene kaa samay nahin rahata or unhen kuch tarkon ko andekha karnaa padataa he jis par phir mul team dhyaan kendrit karti he
 Policy debate is practiced mostly in the United States, although it has also been tried in Europe and Japan and has certainly influenced other forms of debate
 iske vikaas ko kuch log ek adhik gudh style kii disha main hue vikaas ke rup main dekhte hai
 Classical debate is a relatively new debate format, first created and used primarily in the state of Minnesota
 ise, niti vaad-vivaad ke ek vikalp ke rup main gathit kiya gaya tha
 Some adjudicators and coaches felt that the development of policy debate has made it a very special form of debate, where the pace of speaking goes beyond comprehension and focuses on real-world arguments, focusing on "strategic" arguments
 Less emphasis is put on it which is often almost absurd
 niti ke samaan hi ek sanrachana ke saath, shastreey vaad-vivaad, tark or vaastavik duniya kii charchaa par jor detaa he
 For this reason, it is often nicknamed "light policy"
 niti ke vipareet, jahaan prayek samarthak ek nai yojana kaa prastaav rakhata he, shastreey vaad-vivaad saral he: ek prastaav ko satr kii shuruyaat main chunaa jaataa he, jiskaa samarthakon dwaara samarthan or vipakshiyon dwaara virodh kiya jaataa he
 The emphasis on depth, rather than the spread provided by the restriction, gives rise to interesting rounds that often result in logic and which would otherwise remain weak in other formats
 achintit vaad-vivaad ek style he jisamen koi agrim taiyaari nahin hoti he or pratham or dwitiya vaktaa vaali do timen hoti hai
 While most adjudicators allow the disputants to cite current events and various figures, the only research that is allowed is one or more articles that are given to the disputant with the offer a little before the debate
 yah, pratham samarthak vaktaa ke rachanaatmak bhaashan se shuru hota he, jiske baad vipakshi bolta he; phir kramshah samarthak or vipakshi kaa doosraa daur shuru hota he
 Each of these speeches is six minutes long and is followed by two minutes of cross-examination
 iske baad phir kramshah samarthak or vipakshi pratham vaktaa khandan hota he or ek vipakshi or samarthak dwitiya vaktaa khandan hota he
 These speeches are four minutes long
 khandan ke dauraan koi nayaa bindu vaad-vivaad main laayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 This style of debate focuses on the main three controversies, although a team may use two or four
 samarthak paksh ko jeetne ke liye, sabhi vipakshi tarkon ko parajeet karne or samarthak tarkon ko banaae rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most of the information presented in a debate must be tied up or "sign posted" to support one of these arguments
 achintit vaad-vivaad kaaphi kuch niti vaad-vivaad ke samaan he; ek mukhya antar, haalanki yah he ki achintit vaad-vivaad prastaav ke karyanvayan par kam jor detaa he
 The lincoln-douglas Debate, a form of high school debate primarily in the United States named after the 1858 lincoln-douglas Debate, is a one-on-one program that The focus is on applying philosophical principles primarily to real-world issues

 This proposal, which changes every two months, raises the question of whether a particular policy or action conforms to a specific value
 haalanki, yah, niti vaad-vivaad ke ek vikalp ke rup main sthapit he, niti vaad-vivaad main janmi kuch takneekon ko apnaane kaa ek majboot aandolan maujuud rahaa he 
 Schemes, counter-schemes, critical theories, post-modern theories and critiques about this activity and theoretical basis itself, if not universally, have reached more than casual experimentation
 paaramparik LD vaad-vivaad, niti vaad-vivaad kii "shabdaawalee" se mukt rahane kaa prayaas karata he
 lincoln-douglas speech can range from a conversational speed to over 300 wpm
 is takanic ko gati ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The emphasis on carded evidence is increasing, though still less than in policy debate
 in pravritiyon ne un vivadakartaaon, nirnaayakon or prashikshakon ke bich is gatividhi ke bheetar ek gambhir daraar ko paidaa kar diya he, jo in parivartanon kii mukhaalafat yaa inhen sweekaar karte hai or ve jo iskaa joardaar virodh karte hai
 Policy and lincoln-douglas debate tournaments are often held concurrently at the same school
 karl poper vaad-vivaad, jise prasiddh darshanik ke naam par rakhaa gaya he, purvi europea or madhya-asian ucch vidyalayon main vyapak rup se istemaal kiya jane vaala vaad-vivaad praaroop he
 Originally, the Karl Popper debate, created by the Open Society Institute as a more flexible party debate format, has become quite popular as the first format that many high school students learn
 yah sangat or aksar gahare vibhaajankaree prastaav par kendrit hota he, jo bhinn drushtikon ke liye aalochanatmak vichaar kaushal ke vikaas or sahansheeltaa par bal detaa he

 The number of heartbeats occurring in each unit of time is called the heart rate - expressed as beats per minute - which varies according to the body's need to absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide
 Like exercise or at bedtime
 Measurement of heart rate is done by physicians for diagnosis and monitoring of diseases
 It is also used by individuals, such as athletes, who are interested in monitoring their heart rate to get the maximum benefit from their practice
 The interval from r wave to r wave is the reverse of the heart rate

 Resting heart rate is the heart rate measured when a person is at rest - when he is lying in an awake state and has not done physical exertion before
 Adults have an ideal heart rate of 60–80 beats per minute in resting condition, reduced tremor at less than 60 beats per minute, and cardiac arrest at rates greater than 100 beats per minute
 It should be kept in mind that the heart rate of athletes is often less than 60 per minute at rest
 Cyclist Lance Armstrong had a resting heart rate of 32 per minute, and it is not uncommon for people who exercise regularly to be under 50 per minute
 Other cyclists like Miguel Indurain and Alberto Contador have a resting heart rate of between 20 and 30, and American Marathon candidate Ryan Hall's heart rate was 29

 Heart rate is the maximum safe heart rate for a person
 The most accurate way to measure heart rate is through a heart pressure test
 In such examination, the person is monitored with EKG along with exercising
 At the time of examination, the intensity of the workout is periodically increased and kept until the EKG begins to undergo some specific changes related to heart function and at this point the person is asked to stop
 
 Such examination is usually of 10 to 20 minutes

 Different formulas are used to estimate individual maximum heart rates, based on age, but maximum heart rates vary greatly between different individuals
 Maximum heart rates are also 160 in the only elite sports team like Olympic sailors of 20 years
 Can be up to 220 This variation is as large as 60 to 90 years of age, which is as much as the linear equation given below, and points to the skin variation in these average figures
 adarsh vyatikram ke sanket ke bina paaya jane vaala sabase aam sutara he: This source is credited to various sources, but it is widely believed that it was developed in 1970 by Dr
 William Haskell and Dr
 Samuel Fox
 Inquiries into the history of this formula reveal that it was not developed from original research, but rather the result of observations based on information from published research or about 11 references from unpublished scientific collections
 This formula began to be used extensively after Polar Electro used its heart rate monitors, which Dr
 Haskell "laughed off," saying that it was "the ultimate guide to the training of people at any time

9 - —and a nonlinear equation— Heart rate was very similar to - = 191
5
 The confidence interval of this linear equation was ± 5–8 beats per minute and the more agile range of the nonlinear equation was ± 2–5 beats per minute
 a third nonlinear equation was also developed — heart-rate = 163 + -

 Next, note that the actual maximum heart rates of individuals of the same age, same practice, same game, same team can vary by 60 fpm - this range is extremely large and some people say that, "heart rate is probably the lowest volatile figure when comparing athletes

 or striyon ke liye - The target heart rate, or training heart rate, is the range of expected heart rate achieved during aerobic exercise that helps a person's heart and lungs gain maximum benefit from exercise
 This category varies according to the person's physical condition, gender, and past practice
 Below are two ways to calculate the target heart rate
 In each of these ways, there is an element called "intensity" that is expressed as a percentage
 The heart rate can be calculated as a range of 65% –85% intensity
 However, for these calculations to be meaningful, it is necessary to know the exact heart rate

85) + 70 = 163 dhadkan prati minute One method used as an alternative to the Karvonen method is the Zoladz method, in which exercise fields are obtained by subtracting the values from the heart rate
 180 ke hriday darmax vaale kisi vyakti kaa udhaaharan: kshetra 1 : 180 − 50 ± 5 → 125 – 135 dhadakanen prati minuteshetra 4 : 180 − 20 ± 5 → 155 – 165 dhadakanen prati minute Heart rate stores are a term used for the difference between a person's measured or estimated maximum heart rate and resting heart rate 
 Some methods of measuring exercise intensity measure the percentage of heart rate stores
 Also, as a person increases his cardiovascular fitness, his heart rate declines and thus the heart rate reserves increase
 Heart rate is equal to the percentage of VO2 stores

 a gradual decrease in heart rate after exercise can be a sign of heart disorder
 If the heart rate falls below 12 beats per minute after stopping exercise, this may indicate a greater risk of heart attack

 The standard textbooks of physiology and pharmacology state that the rate of heart rate can be easily calculated from the ECG in the following way: hriday dar=1500 / aaraar antaraal mimi main, hriday dar=60 / aaraar antaraal secondon main, yaa hriday dar=300 / do aar laharon ke bich sthit bade chaukoron kii sankhya

 An Australian international study of patients with cardiovascular disease has shown that heart rate is a specific indicator of the risk of heart attack
 In this study published in Lancet, 11,000 people in 33 countries were studied who were being treated for heart problems
 Patients whose heart rate was more than 70 per minute were found to have more heart attacks, hospital admissions and surgery
 Ben Friedman, a professor of cardiology at the University of Sydney and Kanchard Hospital in Sydney, said, "if your heartbeat is high, you are more likely to have a heart attack and see a 46 percent increase in the number of hospitalizations for traumatic or fatal heart attacks

 In every case, the authors are actually pointing to an instant heart rate, which is the number of heart beats when RR intervals remain constant
 But since the above formula is almost always said, the students calculate the rate of beating in this way without looking at the ECG further

 ve bengali kavi the
 a collection of Muktak poems called Aryasaptashati is considered to be the work of Govardhan
 jayadev ke gitgovind main govardhanacharya ko rassiddh kavi kaha gaya he
 Jayadeva has become a well-known devout poet of Bengal during the time of Ballansen's son Lakshmanasena

 Govardhanacharya's name is also counted among those five gems

 The period of Lakshmanasena is considered to be the latter half of the twelfth century and it is also the period of Govardhan

 It should have 700 Aryas stored but the number of Aryans has reached 760 in different versions

 This collection was very popular in the medieval era and many out of date compositions were written with the shadow of his Aryans
 bihari kavi kii "satsai" is sangrah se bahut prabhavit he
 It is mentioned in Aryasaptashati that this attempt was made to inculcate the stream of Shringararas which was available only in Prakrit
 yahan sanket haal kii "gathasptshati" kii ore he
 Haal has composed adornments in Prakrit saga
 govardhan ne inhi gaathaon ko apni aryaaon kaa adarsh banaaya
 Prakrit's saga is closer to the Sanskrit Aryanchands, so Govardhan chose Aryachanda to create
 keval chand main hi nahin apitu bhavchitran main bhi govardhan haal kaa bahudhaa anukaran karte hai
 But it should not be understood from this that Aryasaptashati is just a Sanskrit translation of Gathasaptashati
 jab bhi govardhan kisi gaatha ke bhav ko vyakt karnaa chaahate hai, ve usamen apni moulik pratibha ke pradarshan se nahin chookte
 Therefore, despite being grossly affected by Aryasapsati Gathasaptashati, it is quite malic in itself

 In his compositions, the boisterous form of dressing has come open
 kahin-kahin to nagn chithran apni nagnata ke kaaran rasabhas utpann kar dete hai
 At one place, Govardhan has also spoken of kissing the dead body in love
