 The central religious book of Islam, "al-qur'an", was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad from 610 to 632, which was written for the first time after the death of Hazrat
 Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just Prophet
 Rasool refers to Allah, And consider him the best of all prophets

 At the age of 40, Muhammad received the first oral revelation of the Quran in a cave called Hira

 Muslims believe that Muhammad was asked by Allah to preach monotheism and print idolatry, which was practiced in eastern Arabia, at the persecution of newly converted Muslims in Mecca and the invitation of the Medina delegation, Muhammad and His followers migrated to Madina in 622 AD, this incident is called Hijrat
 Hizrat, the turning point of the life of Hazrat Muhammad, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar of Hijri

 Qur'an's 2: 101, 2: 143, 2: 151, 3:32, 3:81, 3: 144, 3: 164, 4: 79-80, 5:15, 5:41, 7: 157, 8: In verses 01, 9: 3, 33:40, 48:29, and 66:09, Muhammad is called by various names, including bearers of good news, cautioners, and "who invite people to a just God Are, included
 The Quran states that Allah had sent Muhammad as "rahmat ul lil Alameen" for truth and love for the world
 allaah kuran ke surah al-ambia 21:107 main kahata hai :to be according to kanjul iman Muhammad is mentioned in the Qur'an as "pressured", "negotiator", "god messenger", "god servant", "proclaimer", "witness", "eloquent", "warner" "reminding" " Callers are called with names like "god," "stunning", and "kanti Giver"
 quran main mohammad sa0 ko "ahamed" ke naam se bhi sambhodith kiya he | saarvbhaumik bhaichaare kaa niyam or maanav-samanta kaa siddhanth, jiskaa elaan aapane kiya, vah us mahaan yogadan kaa parichaayak he jo hazarat mohammad ne maanavtaa ke saamaajik utthan ke liye diya
 The Quran also classifies some religious issues regarding Muhammad
 The most important of them is the command to follow the teachings of Muhammad, the Quran repeatedly commands people to "follow Allah and His Prophet"
 The name Muhammad appears four times in the Quran

 It is said that Bibi Amina and Muhammad visited Madina to visit the tomb of Hazrat Abdullah
 While returning to Mecca, Amina died due to weakness and illness, Abwa Salt became a deserted place
 After the death of his parents, Muhammad was in the care of his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, but when he was eight years old, his grandfather also died
 After this he was in the care of his uncle Abu Talib
 Muhammad Sahana being orphaned at a young age is seen as a divine plan, under which he can develop the qualities of "self-reliance, reflection and perseverance", and become the founder of a great religion
 Many Islamic scholars believe that the orphanage of Muhammad had made him dependent on Allah, making it difficult for him to have a proper beginning

 After the death of his first wife Khadija Bint Khuvayalad, he proceeded to marry the wives below, and most of them were widows
 Muhammad's life has traditionally been depicted as belonging to two ages: the former Hijrat a town in the western city, from 570 to 622, and at Madina in Himachal Pradesh, from 622 to 632 until his death

783 Neemkathana Assembly constituency is a Vidhan Sabha constituency located in Sikar district in Rajasthan
 yah kshetra sikar lok sabha nirvachan kshetra ke antargat aata he
 There was a complete solar eclipse here on 24 October 1995, on which scientists from many countries researched, the literacy here is around 80%
 The city is the second largest city in Rajasthan after Udaipur in terms of revenue income
 Neemkathana plays an important role in the mining sector Plays Ganeshwar of Neemkathana has been an important part of the copper culture here, it has the most pilgrimage place in Rajasthan
 Ganeshwar Tapkeshwar Baleshwar Thanagaji Kunda Kuyan Adharshila Bageshwar Gaikala Kalera is the main area
 It is surrounded by the hills of Aravalli
 Neemkathana derives its name from the Nimbarka sect living here

 ped-paudhon yaa vanaspatilok kaa arth he, kisi kshetra kaa vanaspati jivan yaa bhoomi par maujuud ped-paudhe or iskaa sambandh kisi vishisht jati, jivan ke choop, rachana, sthanik prasar, yaa anya vanaspatik yaa bhugolic gunon se nahin he
 This word is much larger than the word Flora which is especially related to the caste structure
 shaayad sabase kareebi paryaay vanaspati samaaj he, lekin ped-paudhe shabd sthanik paimaanon kii vistrut shrenee se sambadh rakh saktaa he, jinamein samast vishwa kii vanaspati-sampada samavisht he
 Ancient redwood forests, coastal evergreen forests, moss-growing mosses, desert soil layers, roadside grasses, wheat fields, orchards, orchards — all these are included in the definition of trees
 ped-paudhe biosphere ke mahatvapurn kaaryon main har sambhav sthanik paimaanon par sahaayak hote hai
 First, trees and plants control the flow of many biogeochemicals, especially the cycles of water, carbon, and nitrogen — they also have enormous importance in local and world energy balance
 aise chakra na keval vanaspati ke vaishvik, balki jalwaayu ke bhi swaroopon ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai
 Secondly, trees also strongly affect soil properties, including soil volume, chemicality, and texture, which in turn affect various vegetation properties, including productivity and composition
 tisare, ped-paudhe is grah par maujuud jantuon kii vishaal sarani ke liye vanyajiwan awaas or urja ke strot kaa kaam karte hai
 Perhaps the most important, but often overlooked, factor is that the global flora is a major source of oxygen in the environment, which facilitates the emergence and maintenance of oxygen-dependent metabolic systems
 ]] Most of the work on classification of vegetation has been done by European and North American ecologists and their methods are also radically different
 uttar america main vanaspati ke prakaar nimna maapdandon ke sanyukt rup par aadhaarit hai – jalwaayu ke pratimaan, paudhon ke awaas, phenology or / yaa vikaas ke prakaar or pradhan jati
 vartmaan yues maanak main vargeekaran padanukramit he or non florischik maapdandon ko upree maapdandon main keval nichle do staron main hi samavisht karata he
 In Europe, taxonomy often relies mostly and sometimes entirely on floristic structure, without explicitly speaking about climate, phenology, or patterns of development
 yah akasar sankethik yaa naidanik jati par jor detaa he jo ek prakaar ko duusare se alag karti he
 In the FGDC standard, the hierarchy levels, from the simplest to the most specific, are - mechanisms, classes, subclasses, groups, designs, matches, and relationships
 The lowest level, or relation, is most correctly defined and incorporates the names of one to three major castes of one type
 udhaaharan ke liye, varg ke str par kisi vanaspati prakaar kii paribhaasha, "van, canopi cover> 60% " ho saktaa he, banaavat ke str par, "jaade kii varsha, chaude pattey vaala, sadabahaar, sclerophillas, closed canopi van"; mail ke str par, "arboots menijee van"; or sambandh ke str par, "'arboots menjisi -lithocarpus denciflora van ", kaha jaataa he, jo california or origan, uese main paae jane vaale pacific madrone-tanok van hai
 In practice, levels of match and / or kinship are most commonly used, particularly in vegetative mapping, just as Latin binomials are most commonly used when discussing topics of race in taxonomy and general conversation
 austrailia main victoria main vanaspati ko paristhitivaigyanik vanaspati varg ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Like all biological systems, vegetative society is topical and spatially moving
 ye har sambhav paimaanon par badalte rahete hai
 Mobility in vegetation is mainly defined as caste composition and / or vegetation composition
 samayik rup se, anek prakaar kii prakriyaayein yaa ghatnaayen parivartan laa sakati hai kintu saralata ke liye unhen achaanak yaa dhimi shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Sudden changes are commonly called disturbances - these include events like wildfires, strong winds, landslides, floods, avalanches
 inke kaaran saadharantah samudaay ke baahar hote hai—ye prakritik prakriyaayein hoti hai jo samudaay kii prakritik prakriyaaon se swatantra hoti hai
 Such events can bring changes in vegetation composition and caste structure for a very fast and long time period and can affect vast area
 aise bahut kam paritantr hai jinamein niyamit rup se or baar-baar kisi tarah ke updrav nahin hote or ye har dirghakaalik gatisheel tantra kaa hissaa hote hai
 Fire and wind infestations are particularly common in many plant types around the world
 aag khaas taur par prabal hoti he kyonki yah na keval jivit ped-podhon balki bijon, bijaanuon or jivit meristemon, jo agali peedi kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, ko bhi nasht kar sakati he or jeev-jantuon, mitti ke gunon or anya paritantreey tatwon va prakriyaaon ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 
 dhimi gati se samayik parivartan sarvyaapee hota he –isamen paritantreey aavartan kaa kshetra nihit hota he
 a combination of rotational composition and classification is a relatively slow change that arises over time due to modifications brought by vegetation itself to various variable components of the environment such as light, water, and nutrition levels
 ye sanshodhan kisi bhi kshetra main badhane, bachane or prajnan main sarvaadhik yogya jati ko badal dete hai, jisase flora main parivartan hote hai
 These fluoristic changes cause cognitive changes that occur naturally even in the absence of caste changes in plant growth, causing slow and predictable changes in vegetation
 aavartan main kisi bhi samay updrav dwaara rukawat ho sakati he jisase tantra waapas apni purv dasha main laut jaataa he yaa or kisi maarg par chal padataa he
 This can cause recurring processes to reach or not reach a stable, final state
 iske alaava, aisi dashaon ke gunon kii bhavishyavaanee, bhale vah na ghate, hameshaa sambhav nahin he
 In short, vegetation communities depend on many variables that together determine the limits of possibilities for future conditions
 vanaspati vaigyanik sthanon or samay ke vibhinn paimaanon par vanaspati main dekhe jane vaale prakaaron or prakriyaaon ke kaarnon kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Questions regarding the relative roles of climate, soil, topography and history on the characteristics of vegetation, including composition and composition of castes, are of particular interest and importance
 aise prashn akasar bade paimaane par hote hai or isaliye kisi jod-tod ke prayog dwaara aasaani se arthpurna tareeke se hal nahin kiye ja sakate
 isiliye vnaspatishaastra, peleovanaspatishaastra, paristhitishastra, mrudavigyaan aadi kii jaankaree ke sahyog se avlokaneey adhyayan vanaspati vigyaan main bahut aam hai
 Botany originated in the 18th century, or in some cases earlier, the work of botanists and / or naturalists
 inamen se anek khoj ke yug main khoj kii yatra par nikle vishwa yatri the or unka kaary vanaspatishaastra or bhugol kaa sanshleshit sanyog tha jise aajkal ham vanaspatik biogiography kehete hai
 At that time there was little information about floristic or vegetation types around the world and little was known about whom they depended, so much of the work was limited to collecting, classifying and naming plant specimens
 19veen shatabdi tak bahut kam saidhantik kaary hua
 Alexander von Humboldt, who was among the earliest working naturalists, collected 60,000 botanical specimens during his five-year trip to South and Central America from 1799 to 1804
 Humboldt was one of the first scientists to document the relationship between climate and vegetation patterns in his monumental life-long work, "vise to the Equinational Regions of the New World" - which he wrote in collaboration with fellow botanist Amy Bopland 
 Humboldt described the vegetation in a physiognomic manner in addition to Texanami
 unke kaary ne paryaavaran-vanaspati ke sambandhon par gahan kaary kii shuruuaat kii jo aaj tak chaalu he
 
 aaj kal hone vaale naspati adhyayan kaa prarambh 19veen sadi ke ant main europe or rus main, visheshkar ek pole, jojeff packjoski or ek roosi, liyonti remenski ke dwaara hua
 Together they were far ahead of their time and they introduced or described almost all the important topics of today, long before the West
 in vishyon main vanaspati samudaay vishleshan, yaa phitososhiolaji, gradiant vishleshan, aavartan or vanaspati ekophizialaji or functional ikalaji par lekh shaamil the
 Most of the world, especially the English-speaking world, did not know much of their work until the 20th century through language and / or political factors
 united stats main henry cols or fredrick klements ne 20veen sadi ke shuru main vanaspati aavartan ke vichaaron kaa vikaas kiya
 Clement is now famous for describing the botanical community as an invalid superorganism
 usne tark pesh kiya kijaise kisi vyakti main sabhi avyav tantra milakar kaam karke sharir ke acchhee tarah se kaam karne main madad karte hai or jo vyakti ke vayask hone ke saath milakar viksit hote hai, usee tarah vanaspati samudaay main bhi har jati atyant kade samanvay or talmail ke saath viksit hoti he or paraspar sahyog karti he or vanaspati samudaay ko ek paribhaashit or purvaniyat ant sthiti kii ore dhakelti he
 Although Clements did much work on North American flora, his devotion to superorganism has shaken his reputation, as his work has not been supported by many researchers
 klements ke pratikul, anek paristhiti vaigyanikon ne darshaya he ki vaiyaktik pariklpana, jo kahati he ki vanaspati samudaay paryaavaran ke prati pratikriya kar rahi jatiyon ke ek samooh kaa kul jamaa he, sahi he or samay or sthaan main ek saath ghatati he
 Remensky presented the idea in Russia, and in 1926 Henry Gliasson developed it in a paper in the United States
 klementsian ke vichaaron kaa itnaa adhik prabhaav tha ki gliyasana ke vichaaron ko kai saalon tak asweekaar kiya gaya
 But in the 1950s and 60s, Robert Whitaker's series of well-crafted studies offered compelling evidence for Gliasson's arguments
 One of the most qualified American botanical scientists, Whitaker Gradient was a developer and supporter of Anne lysis in which pluralities of individual species are measured in front of measurable environmental transformers
 teen atyant bhinn monten paritantron ke adhyayanon main, whitaker ne dikhaaya ki jatiyaan mukhyatah paryaavaran ke sammukh pratikriya karti hai or anya saath main maujuud jatiyon se uskaa koi samanvay nahin hota
 anya kaary visheshkar peliobaatani par kiya gaya kaary bade samayik or sthanik paimaanon par is vichaar ko samarthan detaa he
 Since the 1960s, much of the research on flora has focused on topics of functional ecology
 kaaryaatmak dhaanche main, vargikaraniya vanaspatishaastra kaa kam mahatv hota he or sari khojbin jatiyon ke akritik, sharir-rachana or sharirkriyaatmak vargeekaran par kendrit rahati he or iskaa uddeshy yah bhavishyavaanee karnaa hota he ki vishisht samooh vibhinn paryaavarniya parivartakon ke prati kaise bartaav karenge
 is tarah ke drushtikon kaa aadhaar yah dharna he ki kendrabhimukh vikaas or anukulit vikiran ke kaaran visheshkar filogenetic vargeekaran ke ucch staron or bade sthanik paimaanon par akasar filogenetic apeksha or paryaavarniya anukulan ke bich majboot sambandh nahin hota he
 Functional classification began in the 1930s with the division into plant groups based on the location of Ranchier's epicycle meristems
 iske baad anya vargeekaran jaise macarthar kaa - aar prati ke – chuninda jati or grime dwaara prastaavit si-es-aar yojana, jisamen jatiyon ko teen main se ek yaa adhik ranneetiyon ke anusaar, prayek kaa paksh ek chuninda dabaav dwaara lekar-pratispardhi, dabaav ko sahane vaale or rudrals main baanta gaya he
 Functional classification is important in the composition of plant – environment interactions, which have been the main theme in botany ecology over the past 30 years
 aajkal vishwa jalwaayu badlaav, visheshkar taapmaana, varsha or updrav main parivartanon kii pratikriya main sthaneey, kshetreey or vaishvik vanaspati parivartanon kii rachana par bahut jor diya ja rahaa he
 The examples of functional taxonomy given above, which divide all vegetation species into very small groups, are less likely to affect the various constructive objectives that lie ahead
 yah aam taur par mana jaataa he ki saral, sarv-uddeshyak vargikarnon ke sthaan par adhik vistrut or kaaryaatmak vargeekaran aa jaaenge
 iske liye sharir kriya vigyaan, sharir rachanavigyaan or vikasiya jeev vigyaan kii ab se behatar samaj kii jarurat hogi
 aisa adhik jatiyon ke liye jaruri hoga bhale hi adhikansh vanaspati jatiyon main se mukhya jati ko hi liya jaay

 On 15 April 2010, online multiplayer and its down loadable components for the original x box were discontinued
 duum 3 ko varsh 2145 main set kiya gaya he
 Most of the game's story and dialogue were produced by author Matthew J
 Done by Costello
 game kii prishthkatha ke anusaar, union arospes corporation ) sabase badi maujuuda korporate ikai he or isane mangal par shodh suvidha kii sthapana kii he
 On this basis, the UAC is capable of research in many scientific fields, including advanced weapons development, biological research, space exploration and teleportation
 mangal par suvidha sthiti ke kaaran, euasi kanoonee or naitik simaaon ke baahar apni gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan kar sakati he
 As the player progresses in the game, he learns that the staff at the base are unstable
 badi maatra main ghatnaayen is asthirataa ke kaaran hai jaise awaajen sunai dena, aspasht drishyon kaa dikhaai dena or paagalpan or vyamoh ke badhate maamle, jinke kaaran aksar suvidha ke mashinari se ghaatak durghatnaayen ho jaati hai
 Rumors about the nature of experiments in uac's Delta Lab division are particularly prevalent among Aadhaar employees
 duum 3 main paanch mukhya paatr hai
 The player has to play the role of an anonymous Space Marine Corporal who has just arrived at the uac's Mars base
 khiladi kaa gaiyr-kamishan adhikari prabharee master sarjent thomas keli he, jise nil rose kii aawaaj di gayi he, jo game ke pehle aadhe bhaag main khiladi ke radio par khiladi ko uske uddeshy bataata he or salaah detaa he
 The story features Doctor Malcolm Betruger in an anti-humanitarian role, the lead scientist of uac's mysterious Delta Lab division, who works in collaboration with the forces of Hell to oppose humanity
 betrugar kii demen jaisi aawaaj, philip el
 clark ke dwaara di gayi he, jo game ke aage badhane ke saath saath baar khiladi par taana kasati rahati he
 The last two lead characters are Elliott Swann and Jack Campbell

 He is supported almost all of the time by Campbell, another space marine who serves as Swan's bodyguard and has a BFG 9000 weapon
 campbell ko endi chenle kii aawaaj di gayi he
 Swann and Campbell are often a few steps ahead of the player in the game, but they cannot be reached and interacted with until the end of the game
 game main kuch chote paatr bhi shaamil kiye gaye hai jo kahani kaa vivaran dete hai or vishesh sthanon par khiladi kii sahaayta karte hai
 Players encounter multiple scientists engaged in various research and development programs and construction work through the UAC, as well as fellow Marines and security guards
 asainik kaaryon main vyast naagarik karmchaaree or rakrakhaav ke kaaryon main vyast karmchaaree bhi dikhaayi dete hai
 The story of Doom 3 includes dialogues and cut scenes coming to the game, as well as e-mail, audio logs and video files throughout the game
 game kii shuruyaat main iliyat swaan or jaik campbell mangal shahar main pahunchate hai, mukhya rup se ve euasi ke mangal base par pahunchate hai, iske liye prithvi ke parivahan saadhan kaa upyog karte hai, khilaadi kaa anaam marine thik unki peeche ja rahaa he
 Swan and Campbell call a conference meeting with Melkom Betruger as the first part of the investigation into complaints and incidents about the facility, while the Marine operates as ordered by Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly
 keli marine ko delta leb ke ek vaigyanik ko khojane ke nirdesh detaa he jo gaayab ho gaya he
 The Marine finds the scientist at a nearby decommissioned communications facility, where he is desperately trying to send a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger's teleportation experiment
 haalanki, jab vah sthiti ke bare main marine ko spasht karne kii koshish karata he, ek or tele portesan pareekshan kiya jaataa he or niyantran kho diya jaataa he, jis bindu par puraa mangal base aprakritik jhatkon se hill rahaa he, base ke adhikansh karmchaaree zombis main badal jate hai, kyonki nark ke bal teleporter ke portal ke madhyam se akraman karte hai
 Now to stop the attack of the base's changed zombies and the Hell's Demons attack, the Marine returns to Mars City, where Kelly orders the Marines from the remote to form links with the other Marines, saying that at the main communications facility Calls to get a transmission card to call
 jaise jaise marine base main hokar aage badhati he, use pataa chalata he ki swaan or campbell zindaa hai, ve bhi sanchaar suvidha kii ore ja rahe hai taaki mangal kii sthiti ke anusaar kisi sandesh ko bhejne se roka ja sake
 Marine squads are attacked by daemons, killed, and although the marines obtain transmission cards, it is too late to prevent devices from being destroyed by the Campbells in the communications facility
 Kelly, however, instructs the Marines to have a backup system, ordering the Marines to either obey Kelly's orders or use Swan's reasoning for keeping Mars separate
 Accept Assuming not understand the true nature of, till the invasion, so there's no threat to Earth
 sancharan bheja gaya he yaa nahin is aadhaar par, marine ko keli yaa swaan ke dwaara delta leb jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 En route to Delta Lab, the Marine meets Betruger, who is now apparently subdued in cooperation with Hell to invade Earth
 agar marine prithvi par sankat kaa kol nahin bhejti, betrugar khud aisa karata or sambhavatya jahaazon kii sahaayta se damens ko prithvi par laayaa jaataa
 iske baad betrugar base kii punah chakreekaran suvidha main vifailli gaison kaa upyog karte hue marine ko maarane kaa asafal prayaas karata he
 Arriving at Delta Lab, Paramarin learns the details hidden in teleportation experiments, as well as archaeological excavations in the surface of Mars, Betruger's growing passion for tests and expeditions to obtain samples from hell
 khudaai main mangal par ek pracheen sabhyataa ke khandhar milte hai or isse ek avshesh banataa he jise sol kyub ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to a scientist found alive in the Marine Lab, the Soul Cube is a weapon created by ancient civilization to protect against the forces of Hell
 vaigyanik yah bhi bataata he ki akraman tab shuru hua jab betrugar ne game kii shuruyaat main portal main sol kyub liya or ise nark main jamaa kar diya
 The Marine captures Betruger through the lab, but is pulled into the main teleportation portal after Betruger is trapped in a trap
 portal marine ko sidhe nark main le jaataa he, jahaan vah sol kyub ke liye damens kii badi sankhya ke madhyam se ladata he or apane demonic abhibhavak ko haraa detaa he
 The Marine is then able to resume teleportation equipment left by research expeditions in Hell and return to Delta Lab
 betrugar, haalanki, marine ko bataata he ki yadhyapi mukhya euasi teleporter nasht ho chukaa he, nark mangal par ek nark kaa dwaar khol rahaa he, jo kai million damens ko mangal par laane main sakasham he
 Subsequently, in Delta Labs, the Marine encounters an injured swan
 swaan marine ko suchit karata he ki keli puure samay se nark ke saath kaam kar rahaa he or use damens ke dwaara roopantarit kar diya gaya he
 After telling the Marine that Campbell is behind Kelly, Swann gives the Marine his PDA, which informs him of the position of Hell's Gate below the surface of Mars and assures him that he alone can find a way out of the base
 Will try haalanki, jab marine base ke kendriya computer processing sector main campbell ke saath pakad main aa jaataa he, campbell buree tarah se ghayal ho jaataa he or marane se pehle keval itnaa hi kah paata he ki keli campbell kaa bienji 9000 hathiyaar le ja chukaa he
 After this, Kelly Damon's voice taunts the Marine
 ant main marine se kendriya computer kor main keli kaa saamana ho jaataa he, jo keli ko ek siburnetic maanav bataata he jise tanks jaise aadhaar par grapht kiya gaya he
 The Marine succeeds in killing Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 under the surface of the Marine and into the depths before heading to Site 3, the same archaeological dig where the Soul Cube was
 praathmik khudaai kii sait par, marine nark kaa dwaar khoj letaa he, jisaki raksha nark ke shaktishaalee yoddha, siberdeman ke dwaara kii ja rahi he
 Using the Soul Cube, the Marine defeats the Cyberdemon in battle, and the Soul Cube then seals Hell's gate
 antim cat drishy main dikhaaya jaataa he ki bal narsanhaar kii khoj main prithvi se base par pahunch rahe hai
 They find the Marine alive, but they find out that Swan is dead
 ve, haalanki, betrugar kaa pataa nahin laga pate, jise antim drishy main nark main dikhaaya jaataa he, jisane ek dregon jaise demen kaa avatar le liya he
 In June 2000, id Software game engine designer John Kermack revealed an internal company plan that announced a remake of Doom using next-generation technology
 is yojana se yah baat saamne ai ki duum kii rimeking par idi software main vivaad bad rahaa he
 Two owners of id software, Kevin Cloud and Adrian Kermake, were always opposed to remaking Doom, believing that id is often returning to similar formulas and properties

 ID Software began development of Doom 3 in late 2000, just after its completion Quake III: Team Arena
 In 2001, it was presented to the public at the Macworld Conference & Expo in Tokyo and later performed at E3 2002, where a 15-minute game demo was shown

 Early in the development of Doom 3 ', Trent Ranger of the band Nine Inch Nails, a fan of Doom Games, composed the music and sound effects for Doom 3
 haalanki, "samay, dhan or bure prabandhan ke kaaran", trent reconar ke kisi bhi dhwani prabhaav yaa sangeet ko antim utpaada nahin banaaya gaya
 Finally, former Nine Inch Nails drummer, Chris Vrenna, composed and performed the game's theme song

 2002 ke ant main, atiai technologys ke do karmchaariyon ne duum 3 ke ek dawalpment sanskaran ko internet par li kar diya
 a year later, a new trailer was released on E3 2003, and shortly thereafter, the id Software's website was updated for the upcoming project of Doom 3, although it was also announced that Doom 3 was in the 2003 holiday season Will not be ready for jon keramek ke anusaar, vikaas main ummid se zyada samay laga; mul rup se, game ko 2003 kii christmas par release karne kii yojana banaayi gayi thi
 Doom 3 attained Gold status on 14 July 2004, and a Make OS x release was confirmed the very next day
 duum 3 ko sanyukt rajya america main 3 agast 2004 ko release kiya gaya or shesh duniya main ise 13 agast ko release kiya gaya
 Due to high demand, the game was made available at select outlets at midnight on the day of release
 iske atirikt, timothy beset ke dwaara 4 oktober 2004 ko ek linaks sanskaran release kiya gaya
 The Make OS x version was released on March 14, 2005, and on February 20, 2006, Perch 1

 ant main, sanshodhit exbox roopantaranko 3 april 2005 ko release kiya gaya
 a week before the game's release, it became known that an agreement had been reached by ID Software and Creative Labs to incorporate EAX audio technology into Doom 3, heavily influenced by a software patent from another company
 is patent main aisi takanic ke saath deal kiya gaya tha jo chaaya pradarshit karne ke liye thim or inhen keramek kaa reverse kaha jaataa tha, jinka vikaas swatantra rup se jon keramek or creative leb ke programmers donon ke dwaara kiya gaya
 ID Software was to be placed under legal obligation to use the technology in the completed game, so to end the issue, ID Software agreed to license Creative Lab Technologies in exchange for compensation
 jon keramek ke anusaar, ai di software main pramukh graphics ingine develper, duum 3 kii takanic ko teen praathmik visheshtaon ke dwaara samarthan praapt hua: ekikrut prakaash or chhayakaran, jatil anemeshan or aisi patakatha jo puri tarah se dynamik par-picksal prakaash or stencil chaaya ke saath vaastaviktaa ko darshaati he or jeeyuai kii sataha jisamen game ke liye atirikt antarkriyasheeltaa shaamil he
 The advanced key to the ID Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is integrated lighting and shading

 To increase interactivity with the game world, ID Software has designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers
 ek saamaanya "upyog kunjee" kaa kaa prayog karne ke bajaay in computers ko operate karne ke liye, crosshere screen par mouse ke cursar kii tarah kaam karata he or khiladi ko game kii duniya main computer kaa upyog karne main madad karata he
 This allows the in-game computer terminal to perform more than one function, operating the security door code, activating the machinery, unlocking the weapon locker or toggling the light, according to Doom 3 manual, GUI designer Patric Duffy Wrote more than 500,000 lines of script code and created more than 25,000 image files to create graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout Doom 3
 Other important features of the game engine are general mapping and highlighting of the text in a specular form, real handling of object physics, dynamic, realistic sound tracks and multi-channel sound
 The Doom 3 on the x Box supports 480p wide screen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5
1 surround sound
 3 april 2005 ko, ai di software ne windos par duum 3 ke liye ek vistaar release kiya
 The expansion, called Resurrection of Evil, was developed by Nerve Software, a company that is also a partner of ID Software in many other projects, such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein and x Box Conversion of Doom
 Once again published by Activision, a Linux version was released on 24 May 2005 and an x box version was released on 5 October 2005
 is vistaar kii visheshta thi ek baarah staron kaa ekal khiladi abhiyaan, jise mul kahani rekha ke do varsh baad set kiya gaya or teen nae hathiyaar bhi isamen shaamil the, jinamein se ek game main bhautikee kii disha main he
 Several new enemy characters were also added
 multiplayer game ko badhaava diya gaya, adhikarik rup se khiladi seemaa ko aath tak badha diya gaya or game main nae mode jode gaye jaise jhande par kabja karnaa
 The reception of 'resurrection of Evil' was not as positive as that of Doom 3, but it nonetheless received favorable reviews from industry critics
 Best Graphics Doom 3 was a complex and commercial success for ID Software; By early 2007, more than 3
5 million copies of Doom 3 had been sold, making it the most successful ID software project to date

 Doom 3 'graphics and presentation quality were highly praised; Game Spot described the game's environment as "suitably lively, densely atmospheric, and surprisingly expensive", while PC Gamer UK described the graphics and non-player characters' modeling and animation as too "fluid"
 ijien ke den adams ne note kiya ki game kii pregentation main game kaa bahut ucch anupaat shaamil he, unhone kaha ki "vaataavaran ke bina, duum 3 ek saadhaaran shooter he, jo '90 ke dashak' ke saamaan he
 "in addition, many reviewers have praised id software for making the game so good at low graphics levels
 kai samikshakon ne game ke parisar or setting kii bhi prashansa kii he; game spot ke greg kasvin ne varnit kiya "jo ahsaas duum 3 main he, vah puri tarah se vaastavik duniya main he" jabaki ijien ne note kiya ki "euaisi base main bhi bahut hi yathartwaadee bhaavana he, jo vaastaviktaa kaa ahsaas karaati he
 Notably, Eurogamer stated that the game's opening sequence "fits on excellent ideas" defining the half-life of Valve Software
 kai samikshakon ne kaha ki duum 3 "ran and gan" game style ke saamaan he jo apane purvavartiyon ke saath safal tha or is avyav ke liye game kii vaikalpik rup se prashansa or aalochana kii gayi
 Over time, there were several complex reviews of synchronization in the game
 iske alaava, game kii kritrim hoshiyaari ko vishesh rup se chunauteepurn nahin mana gaya, gamespot main note kiya gaya ki "shatru usee prakaar ke anumaanit pratirupon kaa anusaran karata he jise pichley duum games se yaad kiya ja saktaa he" jabaki gamespai ne kaha ki jis tarah se shatru khiladi par hamalaa karte hai, vah "vicitra" he; samikshakon ke anusaar khiladi yah mahasoos karte hai ki ek hathiyaar ko uthaane se kai prakaar ke zombis andhere main chupe hue kakshon se bahar nikal aate hai
 In addition, many reviewers said that the game's way of conveying the story is "ineffective", complicating it for a player character's lack of recognition
 ant main, game ke multiplayer main navinikaran kii kami he, kyonki isaki khiladi seemaa kam he or game ke mods kii sankhya bhi kam he, yah tathy vishesh rup se ai di software ke influential quek III arina ke vipareet sahi he
 The x Box version of Doom 3 received the same level of support, scoring 88 percent on Metacritic and 87

 The Latin word originated from the name Latium district

 Latina script is Roman script
 asal main roman lipi lathina ke liye hi bani he, yani ki lathina kii apni lipi he
 That is why each of its letters almost always gives the same pronunciation
 ati-pracheen roman lipi ye thi The flat line above the vowel meant that the vowel was long, but it was not considered necessary to write it
 baad main unani bhashaa ke udhaar ke shabd laane ke liye unani lipi se ye akshar liye gayi : K, y ), z 
 v began to be used for the consonant ua and u for vowel u
 iske bhi kuch baad j or w jude

 object oriented programing main vanshanukram, pehle se paribhaashit virgon ke prayog dwaara nae class taiyaar karne kaa ek tareeqa he 
 vanshanukram ko maujuuda code main thode yaa bina sanshodhan ke punah prayog ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 New classes, known as sub-classes, inherit the properties and behavior of pre-existing classes, which are specified as super-classes
 sab or super-class kaa vanshanukram rishta padanukram ko janm detaa he
 The concept of inheritance was invented in 1967 for Simula
 vanshanukram ko bahurupata ke saath bhramit nahin kiya janaa chahie, jise saamanytah object-oriented programing main policorphism kaha jaataa he
 There is a relationship between inheritance implementations, while a subtype is a relationship between polymorphism types
 kuch main, lekin sabhi OOP bhashaaon main nahin, uddeshy mail khate hai kyonki up-prakaar ghoshit karne kaa ekmaatr tarika, ek nae varg ko paribhaashit karnaa he jo kisi anya ke karyanvayan ko viraasat main paata he
 The behavioral subtype is never necessary for inheritance
 class ko praapt karnaa puri tarah sambhav he, jiskaa object galat vyavhaar karegaa jab uskaa istemaal aise sandarbh main ho, jahaan janak varg pratyaashit ho; liscove pratisthaapan siddhant dekhen
 Complex inheritance, or inheritance used in an insufficiently mature design, can cause a yo-yo problem
 vanshanukram kaa upyog kai laabh pradaan karata he
 Sometimes the difference in these pulse is desirable, because they are not necessarily clear from the context
 kai object-oriented programing bhashaaen ek varg yaa object ko kisi pahalu ke karyanvayan-aam taur par vyavhaar- ko pratisthapit karne kii anumati dete hai, jo use viraasat main mila he
 This process is commonly called overriding
 adhibhavi ek jatilta pravesh karaata he: vyavhaar kaa koun-sa sanskaran nihit varg prayog kaa aagrah karata he-vah jo apane hi varg kaa hissaa he, yaa vah jo janak varg se he? programing bhashaaon ke bich uttar bhinn hota he or kuch bhashaaen use yah suchit karne kii kshamta pradaan karte hai ki kisi vishisht vyavhaar ko adhirohit or vyavahrut nahin kiya jaae
 Reusing code already in another class has been one of the initial purposes of using inheritance
 is abhyaas ko aam taur par vanshanukram karyanvayan kaha jaataa he
 In most areas, support for class inheritance has been lacking for the sole purpose of reusing code
 praathmik chintaa yah he ki karyanvayan vanshanukram bahurupi pratisthaapan-kshamta kaa koi aashwaasan pradaan nahin karti-varg kaa punah upyog zaruri nahin ki nihit varg ke udhaaharan se pratisthapit ho
 ek vaikalpik takanic, pratyaayojan ke liye or programing prayaas kii aavashyaktaa he, lekin pratisthaapan-kshamta ke mudde kaa parihaar ho jaataa he
 In c + +, private inheritance can be used as implementation inheritance without replacement-capacity
 jahaan public vanshanukram pratinidhitiv karata he rishta "he" kaa or pratyaayojan pratinidhitiv karata he rishta "maujuud he" kaa, to nijee vanshanukram par rishte "ke karyanvayan ke sandarbh main" vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The object-oriented Software Construction, Second Edition, written by Bertrand Meyer, the creator of the object-oriented programming language Eiffel, lists 12 different uses of inheritance, where most involve some amount of inheritance implementation
 bahurupataaon ke kai prakaar maujuud hai 
 udhaaharan ke liye, - Templates, - Member / operator overload, - Decomposition and - Subtype polymorphism
 jab koi object orientation ke saath bahurupata kii baat karata he, to taatpary aksar up-prakaar bahurupata se he
 The subtype polymorphism theoretically means that there can be many types of objects
 jaise Class B: public a {}; b object keval b object nahin hai, ve a object bhi hai
 This has been achieved through inheritance
 ab aap bhi kar sakate hai, Class C: public {}; or up-prakaar bahurupata kii vajah se c object, a object bhi hai
 Now the situation is that both c and b objects are also a objects, because both of them can also be assigned variables of type A
 up-prakaar bahurupata yahi nishpadit karata he
 But it would be completely pointless if b and c objects are the same
 The good thing is that they do not have to be so, because their behavior can be differentiated due to overriding
 atah up-prakaar bahurupata ke peeche pramukh bhashaa tantra vanshanukram he 
 adhibhavi kii bhoomika he up-prakaar object dwaara ek aam super-prakaar saajha karne ko anumat karnaa, taaki unka vyavhaar alag ho
 When inheritance is widely used when designing programs, the constraints imposed by it should also be taken into consideration
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek varg vyakti par vichaar karen jisamen vyakti kaa naam, pataa, phone number, umr, ling or jati shaamil ho
 ham vyakti ke chaatr naamak upvarg ko paribhaashit kar sakate hai jisamen vyakti ke grad-point ausat or lee gai kakshaen shaamil hai or karmchaaree naamak vyakti ke ek anya upvarg main vyakti kaa kaary-sheershak, niojak, tathaa vetan shaamil hai
 When defining this hereditary hierarchy, we have already defined some restrictions, not all of which are desirable: samgr punah prayog siddhant vanshanukram ke liye ek vikalp he
 This technique supports polymorphism and reuse of code, separating behaviors from the primary class hierarchy and incorporating the specific behavior classes expected by a business sector class
 yah drushtikon karyavadhi main vyavhaar parivartanon ko anumat karte hue, varg padanukram ke sthitik swabhaav kaa parihaar karata he or apane purvaj virgon ke vyavhaaron tak pratibandhit karne ke bajaay, ekal varg ko vyavhaar kii bafe style lagu karne kii anumati detaa he
 Inheritance-based designs are sometimes used instead of roles
 ek bhoomika, maan len ek vyakti dwaara chaatr kii bhoomika, maujuud object ke saath jude lakshanon ko paribhaashit karata he, kyonki object, kisi anya object ke saath kuch rishte main bhaag letaa rahaa hota he 
 kuch object-oriented dizine pranaliyaan, vastuon ke adhik sthir pahaluon se bhoomikaaon ke is prayog main antar nahin dekhti
 is prakaar model bhoomikaaon main vanshanukram ke upyog kii pravriti maujuud he, kah sakate hai ki ek vyakti ke chaatr kii bhoomika ko vyakti ke up-varg ke swaroop main gadha ja saktaa he
 However, neither hereditary hierarchies nor types of objects can change over time
 isliye, bhoomikaaon ko up-virgon ke rup main gadhane se, srijan par bhoomikaaon ke niyat hone kaa kaaran ban sakati he, maan len ki ek vyakti paristhitiyon ke badalane par, aasaani se karmchaaree ko chaatr ke rup main apni bhoomika nahin badal saktaa he
 From a modeling point of view, often such restrictions are not desirable, as it imposes artificial restrictions on future expansion of the object system, which can make it difficult to implement future changes, as the current design will need to be updated
 Inheritance can often be better used with a generalization mindset in such a way that common aspects of the example presentation class are made super-class factors; Suppose there exists a common super-class 'legal-entity' for both the individual and company classes, for all the common aspects of both
 bhoomika-aadhaarit dizine or vanshanukram-aadhaarit dizine ke bich pahalu kii sthirataa ke aadhaar par antar kiya ja saktaa he
 Role-based design is used when it is conceivable that the same object participates in different roles at different times, and inheritance-based design is used when general aspects of multiple classes are super- Class factors should be created and they do not change with time
 bhoomikaaon or super-class ke algaav kaa ek parinaam yah he ki isse object pranali ke sankalan samay or karyavadhi ke pahaluon ko spasht rup se alag kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way heredity is explicitly compile-time construction
 vanshanukram karyavadhi main kai vastuon kii sanrachana ko prabhavit karata he, lekin sanrachana ke vibhinn prakaar, jinka istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, sankalan-samay main pehle hi nirdhaarit ho chukaa hota he
 To model the example of an individual as an employee by this method, modeling ensures that only such operations or data are present in an individual class, regardless of where they are used, each individual instance Are common for isse vyakti varg main naukari karne vaale sadsy kaa upyog roka jayega, kyonki har vyakti ke paas naukari nahin ho sakati he, yaa kam se kam yah gyaat nahin hoga ki vyakti varg kaa istemaal keval model naukari karne vaale vyakti udaahranon ke liye hi kiya ja rahaa he
 Object-oriented design, instead, will consider all individuals as "employees" in some sub-set of objects
 Job information will only be associated with objects with an employee role
 Object-oriented design will also model "job" as a role, since the job can be restricted in time and is therefore not a permanent basis for modeling a class
 susangat sthir avadharana yaa to "kaarysthal" he yaa bas "kaam", jo ki avadharana ke aashay par nirbhar karata he
 Thus, from an object-oriented design point of view, there can be one "person" class and one "workplace" class, which are linked to many "in-the-works" in such a way that an example of the individual, the role of the employee Is in, when he does a job, where one job is the role of his workplace in the position in which that employee works
 dhyaan den ki is drushtikon se, sabhi varg jo is dizine prakriya se nirmit hai, ek hi domen ke hisse hai, arthath ve ek hi shabdaawalee ke prayog dwaara vishay ko spasht rup se paribhaashit karte hai
 Sometimes this does not prove true for other methods
 visheshtah bhoomikaaon or virgon ke bich antar ko samajhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he yadi koi sandarbhik paardarshita grahan kar len, chunki bhoomikaayen sandarbhon ke prakaar hai or varg sanderbhit vastuon ke prakaar hai

 Every crime and every criminal should be studied
 isiilie aaj prayek aparaadh tathaa prayek apradhi vyaktigat adhyayan, vyaktigat nidaan tathaa vyaktigat chikitsa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 Psychology considers crime to be the result of man's mental complications
 jis vyakti kaa balykaal prem ore protsaahan ke vaataavaran main nahin bitta uske man main unek prakaar kii hinata kii maansik granthiyaan ban jaati hai
 In these glands, a lot of his mental strength is stored in his mind
 dow alfred edler kaa kathan he ki jis vyakti ke man main hinata kii maansik granthiyaan rahati hai vah anivaary rup se anek prakaar ke aparaadh karata he
 He commits this crime so that he can prove himself stronger than others
 hinata kii granthi tis vyakti main man main rahati he vah sadaa bhitari maansik asantosh kii sthiti main rahata he
 He keeps himself engaged in such works all the time so that everyone will look at him and praise him
 hinata kii maansik granthi manushya ko aise kaamon main lagaati he jinke karne se manushya ko anek prakaar kii ninda sunani padati he
 This person always wants to keep himself the subject of discussion
 yadi uske bhale kaamon ke liye charchaa nahin hui to bure kaamon ke liye hi ho
 His mental gland does not let him remain calm
 vah use sadaa vishesh kaam karne ke liye prerana detii rahati he
 If such a person is punished, it does not improve him, but it makes his mental gland even more complicated
 aise apradhi ke upachaar ke liye maansik chikitsak kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Modern psychology has told us that tightening of the punishments is not enough to reduce crime in society
 iske liye samaaj main sushiksha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 When a person's instinct becomes dominant from childhood, then later he gets published in special kinds of works
 ye kaary samaaj ke liye hitkar hote hen athwa samajavirohi hote he
 The anti-social work is the proper approach to the person
 jis balak ko bade laad pyaar se rakhaa jaataa he or use sabhi prakaar ke kaamon ko karne ke liye chhot de di jaati he, usamen dusron ke sukh ke liye apane sukh ko tyaagane kii kshamta kii nahin aati
 The social feelings of such a person remain undeveloped
 jivan suswatv kaa nirmaan nahin hota
 Due to this, he can neither think good or bad from a social point of view, nor is he able to stop himself from doing evil deeds
 balak ke mata-pita or aasapaas kaa vaatavaran tathaa paathshaalas isamen mahatv kaa kaam karti hai
 One of the objectives of proper education is that the child should have the ability to control himself
 jis vyakti main aatmaniyantran kii sthiti jitani adhik rahati he vah aparaadh utana hi kam karata he
 Many people in society commit unfavorable crimes at their discretion
 iskaa kaaran kya he? aadhunik manovigyaan kii khojon ke anusaar aise logon kaa balykaal thik se vyateet nahin hua hota
 These people were proficient in intellect right from birth, so they could know many types of thoughts
 parantu unke man main bachapan main hi aise sthaayee bhav nahin bane jisase ve swayan ko anuchit kaary karne se roak saken
 Till these permanent expressions become a part of human nature, they do not give the ability to stop human from misconduct
 aise vidvan log aparaadh karte hai or unke liye swayan ko koste bhi hai
 This increases their mental confusion
 kabhi kabhi ve apane anuchit kaaryon kii naitikta siddh karne main apni vidwata kaa upyog kar daalate hai
 Their reforms cannot be done by ordinary criminal law
 ve inase bachane ke anek upaay rach lete hai
 In order to improve such people, it is necessary that education should not lead to livelihood or to achieve practicality, but to the overall development of human personality ie intellectual and emotional development
 jab manushya dusron ke hit main apana hit dekhne lagata he or is sujh ke anusaar aacharan karne kii kshamta praapt kar letaa he tabhi vah samaaj kaa suyogy naagarik hota he
 When such a person does something, it is only for the benefit of the society
 aparaadh ek prakaar kii saamaajik vishmata he
 This is the result of individual mental asymmetry
 is prakaar kii vishmata kaa prarambh balya kaal main hi ho jaataa he
 In order to improve it, one has to make habit in the beginning to experience happiness in the happiness of others
 vah aise kaam kare jisase sabhi kaa hit ho or sab uski prashansa karen
 According to Hindu theology, it is generally an offense to conduct against the rules of theology, social rules and politics

 ganit main riman pariklpana, ek nishkarsh he jiske prakaar riman zeeta samaaroh keval nakaaratmak sam sankhya or jatil sankhya jiskaa asli bhaag 1 / 2 hone par shunya hota he
 Bernhard Reiman introduced this hypothesis, which is why he has been named
 yahi naam is tarah ke parimit kshetron se adhik gatt ke liye riman pariklpana ke rup main kuch nikat se sambandhit anuroop ke liye prayog kiy jaataa he
 The Reiman hypothesis describes the distribution of even numbers
 upyukt samaanyikaran ke saath kuch ganitagyon kaa maananaa he ki yah ganit ke sabase mahatvapurn ansulajhe hue vivaad kaa vishay he
 The Reiman hypothesis, along with Goldbyach's conjecture, is part of the eighth problem in David Hilbert's list of 23 unsolved problems
 yah clay ganit samsthaan ke millenium prez problems main ek he
 The Reiman zeta function ζ is a function that when given any complex number other than 1, its value remains complex
 iske nakaartmak sam skhyo par shunya raht he
 Mane s = -2, -4, -6, रहने = 0 only when habituated
 inhe tuch shunya kehete hai
 Also the values for which ζ = 0 are called non-zero
 riman pariklpana in gaiyr tuch shunyon ke sthanon ke saath sambdhit he
 He says that: Reiman is 1 / 2 of the non-zero part of every non-zero zero of the zeta ceremony
 agar yah pariklpana sahi nikali to,saare gaiyr tuch shunya vikat lain par rahete hai jo jatil sankhyaon se bharaa he jo 1 / 2+ i t ke prakaar rahata he
 a lot of non-technical books have been written about it
 debrishair,rokhmor,du sautoi aadi is prakaar ke kitabe he
 The Reiman zeta function is defined for complex s with more than 1 real part from exactly convergent infinite series
 leonard ular se pataa chalaa he ki is shrinkhalaa ular utpaada ke baraabar hoti he
 Where the infinite product is spread over all prime numbers p, and then the convergence of the Euler product for complex s with a real part greater than 1 shows that ζ is any zero in this region, like any of the factors is null
 riman pariklpana is shrinkhalaa or ular utpaada ke abhisaran ke kshetra ke baahar shunya par charchaa he
 This Dirchlet can be done by expressing it in this type of case as an ETA function
 agar s kaa asli bhaag ek se adhik he, to jita samaaroh ko santusht karata he
 The zeta function, as well, taking the limit, can be increased for these values by giving a fixed value for all values along the positive real part except for a simple pole at s = 1
 riman pariklpana ke vyaavhaarik upyog karata he kai riman pariklpana ke tahat sach main janaa jaataa he, or kuch he jo riman pariklpana ke baraabar dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Reiman's explicit formula for even numbers less than the given number with reference to a sum at the zero of the Reiman zeta function states that the zeros of the oscillations of even numbers around their expected position are controlled by the real parts of the zeta
 Function
 vishesh rup se sam sankhya prameya main truti avadhi baariki se shunya kii sthiti se sambandhit he: udhaaharan ke liye, shunya kii asli bhaagon kii β sankhya ki truti he shunya kiya jaataa he
 Vaughan's coach proved that the Reiman hypothesis forces the "best possible" error of the prime number theorem
 coach ke parinaam, shoenfeld ke kaaran kaa ek sateek sanskaran kaa kahana he ki riman pariklpana kaa taatpary Where π is the prime count function, and log is the natural logarithm of x
 shoenfeld bhi riman pariklpana kaa taatpary is tarah diya
 Where ψ is the second act of Chebyshev
 riman parinkalpana,sam sankhyon ke ginati samaaroh ke alaava kai anya ganit kaaryon ke vikaas par majboot seemaa kaa taatpary detii he
 The Mobius ceremony is an example of this
 us sameekaran ke bayaan he kii: Is valid for every s with more than 1 / 2 real part, where the sum at convergence on the right hand side is equal to the Reiman hypothesis
 sam sankhya prameya hame bataate hai kii, ek sam sankhya se uske baad ke sam sankhya kaa antar laag rahata he
 However, in some contexts it may be more than this
 krimar ne sabit kiya ki, riman pariklpana maanate hue, har khai he
 This is a case in which even the best that can be proved using the Riemann hypothesis is far weaker than what seems true
 sankhyatmak saboot krimar ke anumaan kaa samarthan karata he
 There are many uses of the generalized hypothesis
 riman zeeta samaaroh bahut sari chize aasaani se dirichlet el series ke saath jud sakate hai
 The method which completes the Reiman hypothesis, the Reiman zeta function, can also be adopted to achieve the derivative functions
 samanikrut riman pariklpana kii yah ek vishist or prashamshneey baat he
 Many conclusions made in this way have been made later without the hypothesis of the common sense hypothesis

 beemaa us saadhan ko kehete hai jiske dwaara kuch shulk dekar haani kaa jokhim duusare paksh par daalaa ja saktaa he
 The party whose risk is put on the insured is called 'insured'
 bimaakar aamtaur par ek company hoti he jo bimaakrit ke haani yaa kshati ko baantne ko taiyaar rahati he or aisa karne main vah samarth hoti he
 Insurance is a type of contract
 do yaa adhik vyaktiyon main aisa samjhauta jo kanoonee rup se lagu kiya ja sake, anubandh kehalaata he
 The insurance contract broadly means that the insured provides a certain sum of money to the insured person in the event of the event described in the insurance document
 beemaa karaanevaala jo samayik pravyaji beemaa karanevaale ko detaa rahata he, vahi is anubandh kaa pratideya he
 The word 'insurance' comes from Persian whose meaning is 'to take responsibility'
 dow raghuveer ne iskaa anuwaad kiya he - 'agop'
 His English synonym is "insurance"
 beemaa vastav main bimakarta or bimaakrit ke bich anubandh he jisamen bimakarta bimaakrit se ek nishchit rakam ke badale kisi nishchit ghatana ke ghatit hone par ek nishchit rakam detaa he yaa phir bimaakrit kii jokhim se hone vaale vaastavik haani kii kshatipurti karata he
 Thinking about the basis of insurance suggests that insurance is a form of cooperation in which all insured people, who may be at risk, pay premiums, while only a few of them, who actually bear the loss, Compensation is given
 vastav main jokhim kii sambhaavna waalon kii sankhya adhik hoti he lekin kisi nishchit avadhi main unamem se keval kuch ko hi nuksaan hota he
 The insurer works to distribute the losses of the insured parties to the remaining insured parties
 jua khilne yaa baaji lagane main bhi do vyakti yahi samjhauta karte hai ki amuk ghatana ghatit hone par doosraa vyakti amuk dhanrashi adaa karegaa
 But it cannot be called insurance because the person who holds the stake has no independent interest in the occurrence or absence of that event
 astu, beemaa anubandh ke liye saamaanya anubandh ke tatwon ke saath-saath bimaahit kaa astitv aavashyak he
 For example, no stranger can get insurance of A's life because b has no free interest in living or not
 lekin yadi kha k kii patni ho to k ke jivit rahane main kha kaa hit nihit hone se kha dwaara k ke jivan kaa beemaa karnaa niyamaanukool hoga
 The meaning of insurance interest is broad
 pati patni ke jivit rahane main ek duusare kaa hit to spasht hi he
 Mahajan's interest in the life of the borrower is equally valid
 isi prakaar sampatti beemaa ke liye bimaahit us sampatti ke swami ko to he hi
 This interest also becomes available to the person to whom any property is available under a contract
 yahi nahin, sampatti par kabja maatr hone se, bhale hi vah kabja gaiyrkanoonee ho, bimaahit uplabdh ho jaataa he
 For example, if a bankruptcy has any property in its possession, even if it is automatically unlawful because after the insolvency, all the assets are entitled to the officer's handholding - but also to the bankruptcy to insure that property
 The officer is presumed
 kisi anubandh dwaara beemaa hit utpann hone kaa aadhaar uttardaayitv athwa hit donon ho sakate hai
 For example, when a person rents a house, he has no responsibility to protect the house but since that contract provides security to the tenant, then the tenant is insured for the security of that house
 Interest becomes available beemaa anubandh ke liye beemaa hit kii aavashyaktaa ukt anubandh kii vaidhata aankane ke liye to he hi, kshatipurti ke niyamon kaa paalan karne ke liye bhi yah aavashyak he
 In this regard, there is some difference between English law and Indian law
 angreji vidhi ke anusaar agopya hit kaa vastut: astitv aavashyak he
 But this is not the case in Indian law
 bhartiya anubandh vidhi kii dhara 30 ke anusaar chunki jua yaa shart baaji aadi ke samjhaute avaidh qaraar die gaye hai isliye bimaahit kaa astitv vastut: na bhi ho kintu use uplabdh karne kii uchit aadhaar par aashaa ho to bhi vah beemaa anubandh kii vaidhata ke liye paryaapt he
 The second major basis of an insurance contract is goodwill and honesty
 at: yah aavashyak he ki donon paksh beemaa vishyak sabhi tathy pragat kar den
 The meaning of disclosing is that nothing will be hidden on purpose
 yadi koi saar tathy pragat na kiya gaya ho to doosraa paksh ukt anubandh se mukti praapt kar saktaa he
 In this regard also there is some difference between English and Indian law rules
 bhartiya beemaa vidhi kii dhara 45 ke anusaar jivan beemaa main anjaane main, jaanboojhkar tathaa beyimaani kii ichha se yadi koi galatabayani ho jaae to vah kshamya maani gai he
 But according to the common law, inadvertently any misstatement affects that contract
 beemaa ke anubandh do prakaar kii shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 Contracts in which liability for compensation and those in which there is no question of compensation but a contract to pay a certain amount
 kshatipurti vishyak beemaa saamudriya bhi ho saktaa he or gairsamudriya bhi
 The first example is the insurance of similar protection sent by sea to foreign countries and the second example is fire insurance or motor insurance
 kshatipurti ke anubandh main keval kshati kii purti kii jaati he
 Even if the insurance of the same item is in more than one place, only the compensation amount is available to the insurer
 haan, ve beemaa companiyaan aapas main adaayagi kii dhanrashi kaa bhaag nishchit kar leti hai
 Hence, this principle of compensation contract does not apply to life insurance and accident insurance
 at: jivan beemaa tathaa durghatana beemaa kitni bhi dhanrashi ke liye kiya gaya he, beemaa karaanevaale ko athwa uske manonith vyakti ko vah puri rakam uplabdh hoti he
 As has been said, fire insurance is a contract for compensation, ie the amount inscribed on the insured will definitely be received, but not to the extent that compensation can be recovered
 agni beemaa anubandh yadhyapi kisi na kisi sampatti ke sambandh main hi hota he, phir bhi vah vyaktigat anubandh hi he arthath ukt sampatti ke swami athwa us sampatti main beemaa hit rakhanevaale vyakti ko us anubandh dwaara kshatipurti se aashwast kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, if the insured has no right of ownership or any other kind in which property provides him an insurance interest, he cannot avail the contract even after the insurance is done
 sampatti kaa swaamitv badalane par yadhyapi beemaa hit hastantarit ho jaataa he kintu beemaa anubandh angreji kanoon ke anusaar swat: hastantarit nahin hota
 If the intention is to transfer the property as well as the contractual benefit thereof, the permission of the insurer is still necessary
 bhartiya vidhi main aisa nahin he
 According to Sections 49 and 133 of the Fixed Assets Transfer Method, in the absence of any contrary contract, the property recipient may seek the benefit of the insurance contract for compensation
 ek hi vastu main ek se adhik logon ko kuch kuch adhikaar uplabdh ho sakate hai evam unke vibhinn prakaar ke beemaa hit ho sakate hai
 Therefore, all of them can get multiple insurance on the property of that one depending on their interests
 agni beemaa anubandh par kshatipurti kaa daawa karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki kshati kaa nikat kaaran agni hi ho or agni kaa arth he ki chinagaari nikali ho 
 Burning of an object due to excessive pressure of an object is not considered as fire
 bijli girane se honevli haani par "chinagaari lagane" kii anivaaryta kaa niyam lagu nahin hota
 Damage caused by an explosion is not called loss from fire, even if the explosion was caused by fire
 iskaa aadhaar yah he ki haani kaa nikat kaaran agni hi hona chahie
 Similarly, in the event of fire, any loss incurred by acts done by a third party is also not included in the fire loss
 lekin agni athwa jalhani kii seemaa kaa nirdhaaran agni bujhane ke turant baad hi nahin kiya jaataa varan us samay kiya jaataa he jab ukt beemaa sampatti beemaa karaanevaale ko saunpi jaati he
 There are three types of fire insurance contracts: moolyankit beemaa anubandh main yadi sampatti purna nasht ho jaae to beemaa patr par likhit dhanrashi beemaa karanevaale ko anivaary rup se deni padati he
 If the entire property is destroyed in the valuation insurance contract, the said property is evaluated at that time
 sampurna tathaa anishchit agni beemaa anubandh main vastuon kii suchi nahin di jaati varan agni se hanibhay kaa beemaa saamaanya rup main kiya jaataa he
 The amount in the prescribed fire insurance relationship is written on the prescribed insurance letter
 ausat agni beemaa anubandh main anupatik kshatipurti kii jaati he : agni beemaa anubandh main punasthaapan, ausat tathaa bhaagadari siddhant lagu hote hai
 Life insurance also began with maritime insurance often because the owners of ships going on business voyages were concerned about managing against the possibility of ship damage, while the lives of the captains of those ships were equally valuable
 saath hi jab kaarigaron ke sanghon kii sthapana hone lagi or janm mrityu ke lekhe rahane ke saath saath aayu seemaa ke ausat nikaalane ke niyamon kii sthapana kii ja saki to jivan beemaa anubandh kaa bhi kaaphi prasar ho sakaa
 But the terms of insurance papers were quite difficult at that time
 amareeki grihayuddh ke purv ke jivan beemaa anubandh kii sharton ke anusaar beemaa patr kaa kaai arpan mulya nahin hota tha
 No debt could be paid on insurance
 beemaa pravyaji adaa karne ke liye atirikt samay nahin miltaa tha tathaa aatmahatya, dwandvayuddh athwa samudrayatra karne par beemaa avaidh qaraar de diya jaataa tha
 Life insurance is a contract between two persons - the insurer and the insurer - according to which the insurer undertakes to receive a fixed sum of money for a fixed period for timely payments and the insurer takes a fixed amount at a fixed time in lieu of those scheduled payments
 Pledges to pay anya prakaar ke beemaa anubandhon or jivan beemaa anubandh kaa antar yahi he ki yah keval maanav jivan se sambandhit he or beemaa anubandh kaa prakaar athwa rup kuch bhi ho usamen mul shart yahi hoti he ki anubandh ke chaalu rahane ke kaal main yadi beemaa karaanevaale kii mrityu ho jaaegi to beemaa karanevaala bimaptr par likhit dhanrashi adaa karegaa
 The cause of death can only terminate this contract in two conditions
 ek, yadi beemaa karaane vaale ke hi kisi gaiyrkanoonee krity dwaara uski mrityu hui ho
 Two, if the insured died due to such reasons, which have since been included in the insurance document
 is vishay par angreji vidhi or bhartiya vidhi main kuch antar he
 Attempting to commit suicide in India is a crime, but suicide is not a crime, so a similar insurance contract can be terminated on suicide, whose condition is written in the memorandum
 angreji vidhi main aatmahatya kaa vishay pehali shrenee main aata he
 The money received in life insurance is considered a debt on the insured
 isliye sampatti-hastantaran-vidhi kii dhara teen ke antargat yah "sampatti" kii shrenee main aa jaataa he tathaa ukt vidhi kii dhara 130 ke anusaar iskaa hastantaran kiya ja saktaa tha
 Now, the arrangement of transfer of life insurance funds has been made in section 38 and 39 of the Insurance Law
 ukt dhanrashi kaa hastantaran abhihastankan dwaara bhi kiya saktaa he or namakan dwaara bhi 
 In an assignment, the insured transfers his rights and interests arising from that insurance contract to another
 namakan kaa arth keval yah he ki beemaa karaanevaale kii mrityu par yadi namankit vyakti jivit ho to bime kii dhanrashi use uplabdh ho jaae
 Nomination is subject to change without notice
 yadi namankit vyakti kii mrityu pehle ho jaae to beemaa karaanevaale ko hi dhanrashi paane kaa adhikaar pun: praapt ho jaataa he
 This is not the case in assignments
 yadi ek baar beemaa anubandh ke adhikaar abhihastankit kar die gaye to uski purv anumati ke bina doosraa abhihastankan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If the insured dies before the insured dies, those rights do not get returned to the insured but become available to the heirs of that deceased person
 anubandh ke antargat do prakaar kii paristhitiyaan aa sakati hai- The life of individuals is surrounded by a variety of uncertainties and risks
 use kuch sampatti se sambandhit jokhimein he to kabhi jivan ko jokhim he at: vah in jokhimon ke prati kai se suraksha praapt kare isi vichaar ne beemaa ko ek aavashyaktaa bana diya he
 If the insurance is said to be directly or indirectly the basis of the current industrial development, there will be no exaggeration
 manushya jivan ko tanaav mukt karne hetu beemaa ek mahati aavashyaktaa ban gaya he
 The need for insurance can be estimated based on the following points: sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath-saath beemaa kaa mahatv bhi badhata ja rahaa he, kyonki jokhimon, durghatnaon va anischitataaon, main vruddhi hoti ja rahi he aaj ham aise kisi de sha kii kalpana nahin kar sakate jo beemaa kaa laabh nahin uthaa rahaa ho
 Today, insurance has made its debut in every sphere of social and business world from its initial form and is gaining popularity on the basis of its utility
 beemaa kii upyogita se prabhavit hokar britain ke pradhanmantri sar vinston churchill ne kaha tha “yadi meraa vash chale to main dwaar-dwaar par yah ankit kara duun ki beemaa karaao
 " beemaa sampoorn maanavjaati evam isse sambandhit sabhi virgon ko saamaajik evam aarthik rup se laabh pahunchaata he
 In a nutshell one can say that in the modern era, the importance of insurance is doubling day and night
 beemaa ke mahatv athwa laabhon ko nimnaankit vargeekaran dwaara samajha ja saktaa he
 Insurance can lead to lower benefits at the individual level
