5 to 5
0 μm

 The likelihood of spread from one person to another depends on a number of factors including the exit of infectious droplets by the carrier, the effectiveness of air circulation, the duration of the infectious stay, the severity of the M
 tuberculosis effect, the level of resistance in the uninfected person and others
 Is included

 Treating a disease by inserting a gene into cells and tissues is gene therapy, such as substituting a malignant mutant allele that causes it to cure a hereditary disease
 Although this is controversial, but gene therapy can change a person's gene equation and function to make the desired changes in the direction of the desired goal and the human genetic development can be done

 Scientists took a logical step by trying to get the genes directly into human cells
 It was focused primarily on diseases that result from disturbances of a single gene, such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia, or anemia, although it is more difficult than modifying normal bacteria, primarily
 This is because taking large parts of DNA and putting them in the right place in relatively large human genome is quite a problem

 Therefore, the changes caused by the therapy will be genetic and will be passed on to future generations
 These innovative approaches should, theoretically, be highly effective in countering genetic disorders and hereditary diseases

 This process should be done in such a way that the gene that allows the virus to enter the host's genome remains intact
 This is misleading and requires significant research and understanding of the virus's genes to be detected

 When a retrovirus infects a feeding cell, it releases its RNA into the cell of the host along with some other enzymes, these enzymes are - reverse transcriptase and integrase
 The retrovirus must be present before it can be added to the genetic material of the feeding cell
 Let's make a copy of DNA from your RNA molecule that can add to the genetic material of the food cell
 The process of making a copy of DNA from an RNA molecule is called reverse transcription

 When this DNA copy is made and is freely found in the nucleus of the food cell, it is necessary that it becomes included in the genome of the food cell
 This means that it enters the cell's large DNA molecule
 This process is done by another enzyme found in the virus called integrase
 ab virus kii anuvanshik saamagree ke anusaar kaha ja saktaa he ki bhojandai koshika ab ek nae jin ko dhaaran karne ke liye sanshodhit kar di gayi he
 If this host cell subsequently divides, then all new cells in its lineage will carry the new gene, sometimes the genes of retroviruses do not express their information immediately

 If the genetic material enters between one of the original genes of the food cell, then this gene will be disrupted
 If this is the gene that controls cell division, then cell division can be uncontrolled due to its inhibition
 To resolve this problem recently zinc finger nuclei began to be used or specified at specific locations of the chromosome to bind using certain sequences, such as the beta globin locus control region, to specific chromosomal sites of integration

 So far, four children in France and one in the UK have developed blood cancer due to intrauterine mutagenesis by retroviral carriers, except one of which has responded well to conventional leukemia therapy per conventional adenocine diaminase enzyme deficiency

 The genetic material of the adenovirus is not included in the genetic material of the host
 The DNA molecule is left free in the nucleus of the host cell, and the transcription or transcription of the instructions associated with this additional DNA molecule takes place in the same way as any other gene
 So much so that these additional genes do not diploid at the time of cell division and therefore in the responsible cell There is no additional gene
 Consequently, treatment with adenoviruses will require that the growing cell population be re-managed even if the host's lack of involvement in the cell's genome will prevent the cancer from those seen in SCID tests

 But recombinant aavs that do not contain any virus gene but only therapeutic genes are not integrated into the genome
 Instead, the recombinant viral genome at its ends, through the ITR arm combination, creates circular structures of the episome, which are considered to be the primary cause of long-term gene expression
 eevi ke prayog main kuch kamiyaan bhi hai, jisamen shaamil he ye ki ye diene kii bahut thodi maatr rakhata he or ise utpann karnaa kaaphi kathin he
 Nevertheless, this type of virus is used because it is non-pathogenic

 However, clinical trials have also been initiated where AAV carriers are used to deliver genes to the brain
 yah sambhav he kyonki eevi virus aisi koshikaon ko sankramit kar sakate hai jo ki vibhajit nahin ho rahi, jaise ki aise neurons jinamein unke jinom ek lambey samay ke liye vyakt hote hai The virus carriers described above have a natural host cell population that they can most efficiently infect

 For the purposes of gene therapy, it may be desired that a gene therapy carrier increase the range of receptive cells
 To eliminate this, several carriers have been developed, including endogenous virus envelope proteins or envelope proteins of other viruses
 , Or are replaced by chimeric proteins
 aise kayimera main virus ke protein kaa wo hissaa hota he jo vyrion main shaamil hone ke liye zaruri he or saath hi wo anukram bhi jo vishesh bhojandaayee koshika ke protein ke saath kriya karne ke liye zaruri he
 Viruses in which such invagination proteins are conditioned are called pseudo virus viruses
 For example, the most well known retro virus which is considered to be effective for gene therapy testing is the lenti virus simian immune deficiency virus which is blistering
 In the envelope of the envelope protein called g protein derived from the oral virus or vesicular stomatitis virus
 is vaahak ko ve es ve ji chhadam lentiveyras ke naam se janaa jaataa he or ye lagbhag sabhi koshikaon ko sankramit karata he
 Its properties are characteristic of VSVG proteins, so that these carriers are covered

 This development will allow the carriers to administer relatively small amounts of order
 The ability to transform unwanted cells will be limited and many concerns of the medical community will be resolved
 Much of the effort made to infect all cells involves the use of kymeric envelope proteins with antibody fractions

 Non-viral rather than viral has its advantages, of which two main advantages are that they are simple to produce and have low immunity to the ability of the host to generate immunity
 Due to its low level, he felt bad; Whereas the recent development in carrier technology has produced such molecules and techniques of this method, which are equally effective as a virus

 This success, however, was no different from other methods, which led to research for improved methods such as electroporation, sonoporation and 'gene gun' to provide naked DNA with the help of 'gene gun'

 There are several ways by which this is done
 One way is to use the specific sensitizer for the target gene to inhibit the transcription of the defective gene
 The second is that of small particles of RNA called SIRNA
 Using the signal to the cell to divide the specific sequence of the MRNA transcript of the defective gene so that the conversion of the defective MRMA is inhibited
 And thus, the gene expression of may be interrupted throughout the country

 xxrep 4 = Lipoplexes and polyplexes koshika main nae diene ke vitaran main sudhaar karne ke liye, diene ko kisi nuksaan se bachaaya janaa chahie or koshika main uski pravishti suvidhajanak honi chahie
isi ke liye nae anu lypoplaxes or poliplaxes banaaye jate hai, inamen ye kshamta hoti he ki parasankraman kii prakriya ke dauraan di en e ko avaanchhneeya kshay se surakshit rakhen
 Plasmid DNA micelles or a liposome can reside in an organized structure-like lipid coating
 jab yah sangathit sanrachana diene ke saath mishrit hokar lyposom kahi jaati he
 There are three types of lipids, negative, neutral, or cationic
 Initially, negative and neutral lipids were used to manufacture lipoplexes for synthesized carriers
 lekin baad main, in tathyon ke baavjood ki unke saath bahut hi kam vishaiylaapan judaa hua he, vah shaareerik dravon ke anukool hai or unhen utak vishesh ke anusaar dhalane kii sambhaavna he; kyonki wo jatil hai or bahut zyada samay lete he, atah lypoplaxes ke nirmaan ke liye dhyaan unpar se hataakar dhanayanit roopon par lagaaya gaya
 Cationic lipids were previously used to condense a negative DNA molecule due to their positive charge, so that their DNA would take the form of a capsule to become a liposome
 It was later found that cationic lipids significantly impede the stability of lipoplexes
 iske alaava apane aavesh ke kaaran dhanayanit lipid koshika jhilli ke saath kriya kar lete hai, vyapak rup se man jaataa tha ki endocytosis koshika dwaara lyposom lene kaa mukhya maarg he
 Endocytosis results in the formation of endosomes, but if the gene cannot be released into the cytoplasm by breaking the endo-soma membrane, they will be sent to lysosomes where all DNA will be destroyed before they can complete their function
 Cationic lipids by themselves can condense the capsules Rupee DNA into liposomes, but their trans-infection effectiveness is very low
 Because of their ability in terms of Indosomiy release is very low
 baharhaal, lypoplaxes banane ke liye jab sahaayak lipid jode gaye, to kahin adhik parasankraman prabhaavashiltaa dekhi gayi
 Later it was discovered that some lipids have the ability to expand the membrane of the endosome so that DNA can escape from the endosome, so those lipids are called fusogenic lipids
 haalanki dhanayanit lyposom ko vyapak rup se jin vitaran vaahaq yaa jin delivery vactor ke ek vikalp ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he, unamem maatr par aadhaarit vishaaktata bhi paayi gayi, jisaki vajah se unka chikitsiya prayog simit ho gaya
 The most common use of lipoplexes is the transfer of the gene cell into cancer cells, where the supplied gene activates the tumor suppressing control genes in the cell and decreases the activation of oncogenes
 haal ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he lypoplaxes shwasan upakalaa koshikaonko parasankramit karne main upyogi he, atah unka prayog putiy yaa sistic fibrosis jaise anuvanshik shwasan rogon kii chikitsa main ho saktaa he
 a complex mixture of polymers with DNA is called polyplexes
 zyaadaatar poliplaxes dhanayanit polimaron se milakar banate hai or unka utpaadan ynic antahkriya ke falswaroop hota he
 a major difference in the way polyplexes and lipoplexes function is that polyplexes cannot release their DNA load into the cytoplasm, so co-transfection with indoleptic agents such as adeno virus is required
 baharhaal, hameshaa baat yahi nahin hoti, polimur jaise ki poliethilemin ke paas endosom nasht karne ke apane tareeke hote he, jaise ki kitosana or trimathilkitosana main
 Due to the drawbacks found in every method of gene transfer, some hybrid methods have also been developed that combine two or more methods
 virosom iskaa ek udhaaharan hai, joki lyposom ko akriy echivi yaa influenza virus ke saath jodate hai
 In this manner, gene transfer in respiratory epithelial cells has been observed to be much more effective than the virus or just liposome method
 anya tareekon main anya viral vaahakon ko dhanayanit lipidon yaa sankarit virus ke saath mishrit kiya jaataa he
 a dendrimer is a polychromatic long molecule or macro molecule that is spherical in shape
 kan kii sataha kai myanon main kriyasheel banaayi ja sakati he or iske parinamswaroop bane fal ke kai gun uski sataha ke aadhaar par tay kiye jate hai
 In particular, it is possible to make a cationic dendrimer, ie, with cationic charge on its surface
 When in the presence of a genetic material such as DNA or RNA, the requirement for the perfection of the charge causes the nucleic acid to form a temporary association with the cationic dendrimer
 dendrimer neucleic amla sanshleshan ke apane gantavy tak pahunchne par use endocytosis ke madhyam se koshika ke andar le liya jaataa he
 Cationic lipids have been the minimum criteria for transfection transfection in recent years
 in pratiyogi abhikarmakon kii simaaon main shaamil hai-kai tarah ke koshika prakaaron ko para sankramit karne kii yogyata kii kami, majboot hamale karne kii kshamta kii kami, pashu namoonon ke prati asangati or vishaylaapan
 dendrimer majboot sah-sanyoji nirmaan or anu sanrachana par charam niyantran or isliye bade aakaar pradaan karte he
 Their simultaneous use gives a strong advantage over existing methods
 dendrimer kaa utpaadan aitihaasik rup se ek dhimi or mahangi prakriya he jisamen kai mand abhikriyaayein or ek aisi baadha he jisane unka vyavsaayik vikaas ko kaaphi gata diya he
 Dendritic Nanotechnologies, a Michigan-based company, developed a method of making dendrimers based on kinetic or kinetic-based chemistry, a method that not only reduced the cost of the process by a magnitude of three, but also the time to complete the reaction that was above one month Was reduced for several days
