 Proponents of democratic globalization are sometimes called pro-globalism
 They believe that the first phase of globalization was market-oriented, constructive world-class political institutions that represent the wishes of global citizens should be followed
 The difference of other globalists is that they do not define this ideology as modern, but they will leave it for free election of these citizens through a democratic process

 Currently, critics of economic globalization see two aspects of this, one is the unforeseen damage seen in the biosphere and the other the perceived human costs, such as poverty, inequality, adulteration of races, increase in injustice, erosion of traditional culture

 nitishastra jise vyavahaardarshan, nitidarshan, nitivigyaan or achaarshastra bhi kehete hai, darshan kii ek shakha hai
 Although the definition and field of ethics have been subject to differences in each age, it can be widely said that ethics discusses general principles on the basis of which human actions and objectives can be evaluated
 adhiktar lekhak or vichaarak is baat se bhi sahamat hai ki achaarshastra kaa sambandh mukhyat: manandadon or mulyon se he, na ki vastusthitiyon ke adhyayan yaa khoj se or in mandandon kaa prayog na keval vyaktigat jivan ke vishleshan main kiya janaa chahie varan saamaajik jivan ke vishleshan main bhi
 By defining concepts such as good and bad, right and wrong, virtue and blame, justice and crime, ethics attempts to address questions of human morality
 bauddhik samiksha ke kshetra ke rup main, vah naitik darshan, varnatmak nitishastra, or mulya siddhant ke kshetron se bhi sambandhit hai
 Three major areas of practice in ethics are recognized: isame vakilo ore apane pakshakaar ko jo bhi salaah di jaati he usee ke hisaab se pakshakaar kaam karata he 
 Rushworth Keyder states that "definitions of" ethics "have generally included phrases such as 'science of ideal human character' or 'science of moral duty'
 " richard wiliam paul or linda elder kii paribhaasha ke anusaar, nitishastra "ek sankalpanaaon or siddhanton kaa samucchy hai, jo, kaunsa vyavhaar samvedan-samarth jeevon kii madad karata hai yaa unhen nuqasaan pahunchataa hai, ye nirdhaarit karne main hamaara maargdarshan karata hai"
 The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy states that the term ethics "is commonly used interchangeably with 'morality' 'and is sometimes more narrowly used to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group or individual"
 paul or elder kehete hai ki zyaadaatar log samjik prathaon, dharmik aasthaaon or vidhi inke anusaar vyavhaar karne or nitishastra ke madhya bhramit ho jate hai or nitishastra ko akeli sankalpana nahin maanate
 The term "ethics" has many meanings
 iskaa sandarbh darshanik nitishastra yaa naitik darshan se ho saktaa hai
 The behavior of man is studied in many scriptures from many perspectives
 maanavvyavahaar, prakruti ke vyapaaron kii bhaanti, kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa ke rup main hota he or uskaa karanmulak adhyayan evam vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 This is what psychology does
 kintu prakritik vyapaaron ko ham acha yaa bura kahkar visheshit nahin karte
 When we get wet due to sudden rain on the way, we do not say bad words to the clouds
 iske vipareet saathi manushyon ke karmon par ham baraabar bhale-bure kaa nirnay dete hai
 Thus the universal human tendency to pass judgment is the mother of ethics
 achaarshastra main ham vyavasthit rup se chintan karte hue yah jaanane kaa praytn karte hai ki hamaare achchhai-buraai ke nirnyon kaa buddhigrahya aadhaar kya he
 It is said that ethics is a regulatory or ideal science, while psychology is a theoretical science
 nishchay hi shastron ke is vargeekaran main kuch tathy he, par vah bhraamak bhi ho saktaa he
 The above classification may give rise to the notion that the work of ethics is not the exploration and inauguration of the rules of ethical behavior, but rather artificially inflating such rules on human society
 kintu yah dharna galat he
 The moral laws that ethics explores are inherent in the basic consciousness of man himself
 avashya hi yah chetana vibhinn samaajon tathaa yugon main vibhinn rup dhaaran karti dikhaai detii he
 The main reason for this diversity is the complexity of human nature and the diversity of human credit
 vibhinn deshkalon ke vichaarak apane samaajon ke prachlit vidhinishedhon main nihit naitik paimaanon kaa hi anveshan karte hai
 In our own era, due to the incorporation of many new old cultures, it may be possible for thinkers to rise above countless stereotypes and ambiguous beliefs, leading to the inauguration of virtually universal moral principles
 meta-nitishastra yah poochta hai ki ham isse kaise samajhate hai, iske bare main kaise jaanate hai or iskaa kya arth nikaalte hai, jab ham 'kya sahi hai' or 'kya galat hai' kii baat karte hai
 This is a positive squeeze of the problems going on in the mind
 mandandak nitishastra nitishastreey kriya kaa adhyayan hai
 It is that branch of ethics that examines a set of questions that originate when thinking how one should work ethically
 mandandak nitishastra meta-nitishastra se alag hai, kyonki yah kaaryon ke sahi yaa galat hone ke maanakon kaa parikshan karata hai, jabaki meta-nitishastra naitik bhashaa ke arth or naitik tathyon ke tatvamimasaa kaa adhyayan karata hai
 Critical ethics is also different from descriptive ethics, because there are empirical investigations into the moral beliefs of the posthumous people
 anya shabdon main, varnatmak nitishastra kaa sambandh yah nirdhaarit karne se hai ki kis anupaat ke log maanate hai ki hatya sadaiv galat hai, jabaki mandandak nitishastra kaa sambandh is baat se hai ki kya yah manyata rakhni galat hai
 Therefore, sometimes normative ethics is called normative rather than descriptive
 haalanki, meta-nitishastreey drushti ke kuch sanskarnon main jinhen naitik yatharthwaad kaha jaataa hai, naitik tathy ek hi vaqt par, donon varnatmak or nirdeshaatmak hote hai
 Traditional, normative ethics was the study of what makes an action what is right or wrong
 ye siddhanth mushkil naitik nirnyon kaa samaadhaan karne hetu vyapak naitik siddhanth pradaan karte hai
 Utilitarianism has always been a dominant view of humans
 yah vichaardhaara manushya ke aacharan ke us paksh ko parilakshith karti he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki == moral philosophy == manav jeevan me naitik sidhanton ko hi naitik darshan kehte hain raajnneetik nitishastra raajnneetik karrwai or raajnneetik agenton ke bare main naitik naitik nirnay lene kii pratha he
 Descriptive ethics is less inclined to the philosophical end of the screen because its purpose is to obtain specific information about how people live and to draw general conclusions based on vision patterns
 nitishastra kaa mul prashn kya he, is sambandh main do mahatvaparn mat paae jate hai
 According to one wish, the main problem of ethics is to tell what is the ultimate credit of human life
 param shrey kaa bodh ho jane par ham shubh karm unhen kahenge jo us shrey kii ore le janevaale hai; vipareet karmon ko ashubh kaha jayega
 According to the second wish, the main task of ethics is to clarify the notion of auspicious or religious
 duusare shabdon main, nitishastra kaa kaary us niyam yaa niyamsamooh kaa swaroop spasht karnaa he jis yaa jinke anusaar anushthit karm shubh athwa dharmik hote hai
 A
 Two intentions give rise to ideologies of two different categories
 param shrey kii kalpana anek prakaar se kii gai he; in kalpanaaon athwa siddhanton kaa varnan ham aage karenge
 Here we will discuss briefly how the rules of morality - if there are such rules - can be of any kind
 niyam yaa kanoon kii dharna yaa to rajya ke dandvidhaan se aati he yaa bhautik vigyaanon se, jahaan prakruti ke niyamon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 State laws are created by the modifiable will of one type of ruler
 ve kabhi-kabhi kuch virgon ke hit ke liye banaae jate hai, unhen todaa bhi ja saktaa he or unke paalan se bhi kuch logon ko haani ho sakati he
 In contrast, the laws of nature are indivisible
 rajya ke niyam badale ja sakate hai, kintu prakruti ke niyam aparivartaneey hai
 The rules of policy or virtue are considered immutable, welfare for the follower and unenforceable
 in drushtiyon se nitishastra ke niyam swasthyavigyaan ke niyamon ke purnataya samaan hote hai
 It seems that man or human nature is spread under the control of two different categories of rules
 ek ore to manushya un kanoonon kaa vashwarti he jinka udghaatan yaa nirupan bhautik vigyaan, rasayanashastra, pranishastra, manovigyaan aadi tathyanveshi shastron main hota he or duusari ore swasthyavigyaan, tarkshastra aadi aadarshanveshi vigyaanon ke niyamon kaa, jinase vah baadhya to nahin hota, par jinka paalan uske sukh tathaa unnati ke liye aavashyak he
 The rules of ethics are of this second category
 nitishastra kii pramukh samasyaayein nimnlikhit he- We can divide the problems of ethics into three classes: param shrey ke bare main purv or pashchim main anek kalpanaayen kii gai hai
 Almost all philosophies in India believe that happiness is the ultimate goal of life, but most of them have a concept of happiness completely different from so-called euphemism
 is duusare yaa prachlit arth main ham keval charvak darshan ko saukhyavaadee kah sakate hai
 There is no systematic description of Charvak's moral intentions, but it is understood that in his euphemism, gross sensual pleasure is given importance
 bharat ke duusare darshan jis atyantik sukh ko jivan kaa lakshya kehete hai use apvarg, mukti yaa moksh athwa nirvana se samikrut kiya gaya he
 In the Nyaya and Samkhya Darshans, the category of exclusion or liberation is envisaged, it cannot be said to be an emotional pleasures but the liberation of the Upanishads and Vedanta can be said to be inward
 vedant kii mukti tathaa baudhon kaa nirvana, donon hi us sthiti ke dyotak hai jab vyakti kii aatma sukh du:kha aadi dwandvon se pare ho jaati he
 This condition can also come in lifetime; The pragya situated in the Bhagavad Gita is said to be a life-free one
 paashchaatya darshanon main param shrey ke sambandh main anek matvaad paae jate hai : There is also different scholasticism regarding what is the source or source of knowledge of our ultimate credit or good and inauspicious
 adhikansh pratyayvaadiyon ke mat main bhalaai-buraai ko bodh buddhi dwaara hota he
 This is the view of Hegel, Bradley etc
 and Kant's intent is also not opposed to it
 kaant maanate hai ki antat: hamaari krityabuddhi hi naitik aadarshon kaa strot he
 According to empiricists experience is the source of knowledge of our auspicious inauspiciousness
 yah mat naitik saapekshyatawad ko janm detaa he
 The third opinion is pratibhānavāda or up jhhvhjj)
 is mat ke anusaar hamaare bheetar ek aisi shakti he jo saakshaat dhang se shubh ashubh ko pahchaan yaa jaan leti he
 There are many forms of reflection
 shaiftsbari or hachesan naamak british darshanikon kaa vichaar tha ki rup ras aadi ko grahan karanevaali indriyon kii hi bhaanti hamaare bheetar ek naitik indriya bhi hoti he jo sidhe bhalaai buraai ko dekh leti he
 In the opinion of a thinker named Bishop Butler, we have a motivating instinct called Sadasadbuddhi which shows us the path of justification while resolving the duality between selfishness and altruism
 hamaare aacharan kii anek prerak vrittiyaan hai; ek vritti atmprem he, duusari par-hit-aakanksha 
 The place of Sadasadabuddhi is above these two, he is decisively distinguished above these two
 german vichaarak kaant kii gananaa pratibhanvaadiyon main bhi kii jaati he
 a common feature of conservative moral principles is that they do not consider it necessary to focus on the consequences of an action in order to decide the good of evil
 koi karm isliye shubh yaa ashubh nahin ban jaataa ki uske parinaam ek yaa duusari koti ke hai
 Or the preconception of all the results of a task is as difficult as it is to control them
 karm kii achchhai buraai uski prerana se nirdhaarit hoti he
 The karma that has an auspicious motivation at its core is satta karma, karma born in inauspicious inspiration is asatta karma or sin
 kaante kaa kathan he ki shubh sankalpabuddhi ek aisi cheez he jo swayan shreyrup he, jiskaa shreyatv nirpeksh evam nishchit he; shesh sab vastuon kaa shreyatv saapeksh hota he
 Only auspicious willpower is illuminated by its own form of light
 naitik shubh-ashubh ke gyaan kaa strot kya he, is sambandh main bhartiya vichaarkon ne bhi kai mat prakat kiye hai
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, the ethos inspired by Shruti is religion and the deeds prohibited by Shruti or Veda are in adharma 
 is prakaar dharm evam adharm shrutiyon ke vidhi-nishedh-mulak hai
 Along with the teaching of Nishkam Karmayoga in the Bhagavad Gita, it has been said that the scripture is the proof for the knowledge of duty and duty
 shaastra ke antargat shruti tathaa smriti donon kaa pariganan hota he
 Different duties have been directed for each varna and ashram of Hinduism; a detailed discussion of these duties is found in the Dharmasutras and the Memoirs
 is koti ke kartavyon ke atirikt saamaanya dharm athwa saarvbhaum dharmaniyamon ke bodh ke liye ko bhi pramaan mana gaya he
 The ethos of gentlemen has been accepted as a pioneer
 naitik aacharan kii anivaaryta ke aadhaar bhi anek roopon main kalpit hue hai
 Religion has been the most important regulator of morality in the history of man
 hamen naitik niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie, kyonki vaisaa ishwar yaa dharmavyavastha ko isht he
 The second regulatory power of ethics is the state
 logon ko aniatik kaaryon se virat karne main rajagna ek mahatvapurn hetu hoti he
 Similarly, fear of society also gives power to moral rules
 kaant ke anusaar hamen swayan dharm ke liye dharm karnaa chahie; kartavyapaalan swayan apane main isht yaa saadhy vastu he
 Those thinkers who preserve duty and duty with the expectation of supreme sacrifice can say that the motivation of moral conduct is basically the motivation for self-promotion
 ham shubh karm karte hai, kyonki vaisaa karne se ham apane param shrey kii ore pragati karte hai
 An important problem of ethics is whether man is free to act? When we call a person good for any of his or her actions, then we clearly consider him responsible for that work, which means that there is a hidden belief that that person was free not to do the work under consideration
 kaant kehete hai : chunki mujhe karnaa chahie, isliye main kar saktaa hoon
 This means that a system of moral living and moral evaluation is not possible without respecting the freedom of the subject
 ham prakruti ke vyapaaron ko bhala bura nahin kehete, keval manushya ke karmon par hi vaisaa nirnay dete hai; isse jaan padataa he ki prakritik tathaa maanviya vyapaaron main kuch antar he
 This difference is due to human freedom
 kisi kriya ke anushthan ko ichha kaa vishay banane na banane main manushya kii sankalpabuddhi swatantra he
 The above opinion is not acceptable to the determinants of determinism
 bhautik vigyaan batalaata he ki vishvabrahmad main sarvatra kaary-kaaran-niyam kaa akhand shashan he
 Each present event is determined by the past
 sampurna vishwa ek brihat kaary-kaaran-parampara he
 All types of events are subject to unbroken rules
 aisi dasha main yah kaise mana ja saktaa he ki manushya sankalp vikalp tathaa vyapaar akaaran evam niyamaheen hote hai? manushya ke kriyakalapon ko vishwa ke ghatnasmooh main apvaadrup nahin mana ja saktaa
 If on many occasions we cannot make a successful prediction regarding human trades, then the reason for this is incomplete knowledge of the regulatory rules of those trades, not the rulelessness of those trades
 nirdharanwad ke siddhant ko bhautik shastron se bal mila he; use prakrutijagat kii yantravaadi vyakhya se bhi avlamb miltaa he
 But this does not mean that determinism is a physical theory
 kaha gaya he ki spinoja tathaa hegel ke darshanon main vyakti kii swatantraaa ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 In Sankhya philosophy, Purush is considered to be nirgun and passive

 a very small businessman can keep accounts in the brain by recourse to memorisation, another can provide written form on paper

 As the size of the business grew and the nature of the business became increasingly complex accounting began to take shape

 The size of modern business has grown so much that hundreds, thousands and thousands of business transactions take place in it

 Therefore, systematic records of these transactions are kept and their systematic knowledge and experimentation is called accounting
 lekhashastra ke vyaavhaarik rup ko lekhankan kah sakate hai
 According to the Bulletin, the accounting terminology of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, "accounting for behaviors and events that are at least partly financial in nature, effectively writing, classifying and summarizing money as a currency and the consequences thereof
" Is the art of explaining
 ’’ According to this definition accounting is an art, not a science
 is kala kaa upyog vittiya prakruti ke mudra main maapneey vyavhaaron or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan, vargeekaran, sankshepan or nirvachan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Smith and Ashburn have presented the above definition with some improvement
 unke anusaar ‘lekhankan mukhyatah vittiya prakruti ke vyavsaayik lendenon or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan tathaa vargeekaran kaa vigyaan he or un lendeene or ghatnaon kaa mahatvapurn saransh banane, vishleshan tathaa vyakhya karne or parinaamon ko un vyaktiyon ko sampreshit karne kii kala he, jinhen nirnay lene hai
 According to this definition, accounting is both science and art
 kintu yah ek purna nishchit vigyaan na hokar lagbhag purna vigyaan he
 The American Accounting Principles Board has defined accounting as a service action
 uske anusaar, ‘lekhankan ek seva kriya he
 Its function is to give consequential information of financial nature mainly about financial units which is useful in making economic decisions by rational selection in alternative behavioral actions
 ’ Based on the above considerations, accounting can be called the art of writing, presenting, interpreting and informing the transactions of the financial nature of the business in a definite, structured and well planned manner
 sarvapratham praarambhik lekhankan ke record pracheen babylon, asyria or sumeria ke khandhar main paae gaye, jo 7000 varshon se bhi pehle kii taarikh ke hai
 The people of the time relied on ancient accounting methods to record the growth of crops and cattle
 kyonki krishi or pashu paalan ke liye prakritik ritu hoti he, atah agar fasalon kii paidaavaar ho chuki ho yaa pashuon ne nae bachche paidaa kiye hon to hisaab-kitaab kar adhishesh ko nirdhaarit karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Based on the above definitions of accounting, the following characteristics are clear - lekhankan ek kala or vigyaan donon he
 In the form of art, it helps to know the financial result
 isamen abhilikhit tathaa vargeekrut len-denon or ghatnaon kaa saransh taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 They are analyzed and interpreted
 vittiya samankon kaa vishleshan evam nirvachan lekhankan kii kala hi he jiske liye vishesh gyaan, anubhav or yogyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Similarly, conveying the meaning of financial data to the internal and external aspects of a business and its changes in such a way that they can take wise decisions in relation to business, is the art of accounting
 vigyaan ke rup main yah ek vyavasthit gyaan shakha he
 It has definite rules for recording, categorizing and summarizing transactions and events
 in nishchit niyamon ke kaaran hi lekhon kaa krambaddh va vyavasthit rup se abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 But it is not a 'completely definite' science, but an 'almost perfect science'
 lekhankan main mudra main maapan yogya vittiya prakruti kii ghatnaon or vyavhaaron kaa hi lekha kiya jaataa he
 Practices that are not financial in nature are not accounted for in books
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek sanstha ke paas samarpit va vishwasaneey karmchaariyon kii ek toli ho jo vyavsaay ke liye bahut upyogi he, kaa lekha vyavsaay kii pustakon main nahin kiya jaayegaa kyonki yah vittiya prakruti kii nahin he tathaa ise mudra main abhivyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Accounting is a service function according to the board's definition of accounting principles
 iskaa uddeshy vyavsaayik kriyaaon ke bare main parimanatmak vittiya suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 The final product of accounting, ie the financial statement, is useful to those who make decisions about alternative functions
 lekhankan swayan kisi dhan kaa srijan nahin karata he, yadhyapi yah iske upyogkartaaon ko upyogi soochna uplabdh karaata he jo inhen dhan ke srijan evam rakh rakhaav main sahaayak hota he
 The main objectives of accounting are as follows - prayek vyavsaayik len-dein ko pustakon main krambaddh tareeke se likhnaa va uchit hisaab rakhana lekhankan kaa pratham uddeshy he
 In the absence of accounting, there would be a lot of burden on human memory which in most cases would have been impossible to bear
 vidhivat abhilekhan se bhul va chal-kapaton ko dur karne main sahaayta milti he
 Accounting protects against improper and undesirable use of business assets
 aisa lekhankan dwaara prabandh ko nimna suchanaaen pradaan karne ke kaaran sambhav hota he - The above information helps the business owner to know that the funds of the business are not unnecessarily idle
 lekhankan avadhi ke ant main vyavsaay sanchaalan ke falswaroop utpann shuddh laabh athwa haani kaa nirdhaaran lekhankan kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 There is a difference between net profit or loss and some proceeds of certain duration and some expenses
 yadi aagmon kii raashi adhik he to shuddh laabh hoga tathaa vipareet paristhiti main shuddh haani
 It is an indicator of managerial skills and business progress
 yahi anshadhariyon main labhaansh vitaran kaa aadhaar hota he
 The information provided by the profit and loss account is not sufficient
 vyavsaayee apni vittiya sthiti bhi jaananaa chahta he
 This is accomplished by letter
 chittha ek vishesh tithi ko vyavsaay kii sampattiyon evam dayitvon kaa vivaran he
 It acts as a barometer in knowing the financial health of the business
 vivekpurna nirnay lene ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon evam sanstha main hit rakhane vaale vibhinn pakshakaron ko vaanchit soochna uplabdh karana, lekhankan kaa uddeshy he
 The American Accounting Association has also given special emphasis to this point while defining accounting
 unke anusaar, The first task of accounting is to systematically and methodically accounting all business deals and events in the journal
 yahaan yah dhyaan rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki lekhankan main unheen saudon evam ghatnaon kaa lekha kiya jaataa hai jo vittiya swabhaav kii hai tathaa jinhen mudra ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 After accounting for monetary transactions, they are classified according to their nature into separate groups on the basis of equality so that separate information can be available for different items separately
 udhaahrantaya samast bikri ke saudo ko, jo bhinn bhinn sthanon par likhe gayi hai, ek hi sthaan par ekatrit karnaa, taaki kul bikri kii raashi gyaat ho sake
 This is done by opening accounts in the ledger
 lekhankan kaa mukhya uddeshy nirnay lene waalon ke liye mahatvapurn soochna pradaan karnaa he
 For this work, at the end of the year, after finding the balances of all the accounts, a list is made from them and two details - profit and loss account and letter are prepared from that list
 in vivaranon se vyavsaay kii laabhadaayakta, vittiya sthiti, bhugtan kshamta aadi ke sambandh main mahatvapurn suchanaaen uplabdh ho jaati he
 In this way all the information of the year is summarized and merges into two details which shows the final results of the business
 lekhankan na keval lekha karne, vargeekaran karne evam sankshipteekaran karne kaa hi kaary karti he balki un aankadon kaa nirvachan karke nishkarsh evam upyogi suchnaaain bhi pradaan karti he
 For example, what was the rate of repatriation in the organization? How much did advertising impact sales growth? Information such as the status of liquidity and payment capacity are available
 lekhon ke vishleshan evam nirvachan se praapt soochnaaon kaa unke prayogkartaaon jaise viniojakon, lendaaron, sarkaar, swaamiyon aadi tathaa vyavsaay main hit rakhane vaale anya vyaktiyon ko sanvahan kiya jaataa he taaki ve vyavsaay kii vittiya sthiti ke sambandh main apni raay bana saken tathaa bhavi yojana ke sambandh main nirnay le sake
 The last task of accounting is to make such arrangements so that various statutory requirements can be met
 anek aise kanoon hai jinaki purti karnaa ek vyavsaayee ke dwaara anivaary he jaise iskar kii ritern prastut karnaa, bikrikar kii ritern prastut karnaa, sebi ke dwaara banaaye gayi niyamon kii paalna karnaa aadi
 Accounting helps in this task
 aadhunik vyapaarik kriyaaon ke safal sanchaalan ke liye lekhankan ko ek aavashyaktaa samajha jaataa he
 Why accounting is necessary can be explained by the following arguments - lekhankan kii anek pranaliyaan hai jinamein se nimnlikhit ullekhneey hai- 1

 Different accounts are formed for all these, which are called 'nominal' accounts
 vyaktigat athwa vaastavik khaaton kii tarah inkaa koi moort aadhaar nahin hota
 For example, accounts of salary, wages, commission, interest etc
 are nominal accounts
 prayek lenden ke do paksh hote hai
 Debtor or debit side and rich or credit side
 is kaaran uskaa lekha likhane ke liye prayek khate ke do bhaag hote hai
 The left hand side is the 'indebted side' and the right hand side is the 'rich side'
 khaaton ko debit yaa credit karnaa - jab kisi len-dein main koi khaataa ‘len’ paksh hota he arthath usko laabh praapt hota he tab us khato ko debit kiya jaataa he
 Debit means that the debtor part of the account will have a transaction account
 isi prakaar jab koi khaataa lenden main dein paksh hota he arthath uske dwaara kuch laabh kisi ko hota he, tab us khate ko credit kiya jaataa he
 That is, the transaction will be accounted for in the credit portion of that account
 prayek lenden main is tarah ek khaataa tathaa doosraa khaataa credit kiya jaataa he
 The debit account has accounts on the debit side and the credit account on the credit side
 credit tathaa debit lekha dohare lekhe kii pranali ke anusaar prayek lenden ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Example: If we have bought goods worth Rs
 100 from Mohan, then there are two accounts in it - one of the goods and the other of Mohan
 ek lekha paane vaale khate arthath maal khate main kiya jayega or doosraa dene vaale khate arthath mohan ke khate main kiya jayega
 For this reason, this system has been called the system of double accounts
 prayek lenden main do lekhe ek debit or ek credit hota he

 Mohammad Rafi was born on 24 December 1924 near Kotla Sultan Singh, Amritsar
 aarambhik balykaal main hi inkaa parivaar lahore se amritsar aa gaya
 His family had nothing to do with music
 jab rafi chote the tab inke bade bhai kii nai dukaan thi, rafi kaa kaaphi vakt vahiin par gujarata tha
 It is said that when Rafi was seven years old, he followed a fakir passing through his elder brother's shop who used to sing from there
 uski aawaaj rafi ko pasand ai or rafi uski nakal kiya karte the
 People also liked his voice after seeing avalata in his copy
 log nai dukaan main unke gane kii prashansha karne lage
 But Rafi got nothing but local fame from this
 inke bade bhai mohammad hamid ne inke sangeet ke prati inaki ruchi ko dekha or unhen ustad abdul vaahid khan ke paas sangeet shiksha lene ko kaha
 Once Akashwani came to Lahore to perform his famous singer-actor Kundan Lal Sehgal
 isko sunne hetu mohammad rafi or unke bade bhai bhi gaye the
 Sehgal refused to sing due to the power failure
 rafi ke bade bhai ne aayojakon se nivedan kiya kii bheed kii vyagrata ko shant karne ke liye mohammad rafi ko gane kaa mauka diya jaay
 He got permission and this was Mohammad Rafi's first public performance at the age of 13
 prekshkon main shyaam sundar, jo us samay ke prasiddh sangeetkaar the, ne bhi unako suna or kaaphi prabhavit hue
 He invited Mohammad Rafi to sing for himself
 mohammad rafi kaa pratham geet ek punjabi film gul baloch ke liye tha jise unhone shyaam sundar ke nirdesan main 1944 main gaaya
 In 1946, Mohammad Rafi decided to come to Bombay
 unhen sangeetkaar naushaad ne pehle aap naam kii film main gane kaa mauka diya
 Rafi got fame in the Hindi world for the first time with the song Tera Toy Broken by Naushad
 iske baad shahid, mela tathaa dulaari main bhi rafi ne gane gaae jo bahut prasiddh hue
 In 1951, when Naushad was composing songs for the film Baiju Bawra, he thought of losing his favorite singer Talat Mehmood
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone ek baar talat mahmud ko dhumrapaan karte dekhakar apana man badal liya or rafi se gane ko kaha
 Baiju Bawra's songs established Rafi as a mainstream singer
 iske baad naushaad ne rafi ko apane nirdesan main kai geet gane ko die
 Around this time, the composer duo shankar-jaikishan liked his voice and also started singing songs from Rafi
 shankar jaykishan us samay raaj kapur ke pasandida sangeetkaar the, par raaj kapur apane liye sirf mukesh kii aawaaj pasand karte the
 Later, when the demand for Shankar Jaikishan's songs increased, he used Rafi Sahab almost everywhere
 yahan tak kii kai baar raaj kapur ke liye rafee sahab ne gaaya
 Soon, music composer Sachin Dev Burman and notably OP Nayyar got very pleased with Rafi's voice and started singing Rafi
 o pi naiyyar kaa naam isamen smaraneey rahegaa kyonki unhone apane niraale andaaj main rafi-aashaa kii jodi kaa kaaphi prayog kiya or unki khanakati dhune aaj bhi us jamaane ke anya sangeetkaaron se alag prathit hoti hai
 Rafi gained a lot of fame with the songs sung under his direction and then became the first choice of composers like Ravi, Madan Mohan, Ghulam Haider, Jaydev, Salil Chaudhary, etc
 dilip kumaar, bharat bhushan tathaa devanand jaise kalakaaron ke liye gane ke baad unke gaanon par abhinay karne waalo kalakaaron kii suchi badhati gai
 For artists like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Joy Mukherjee, Vishwajeet, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra etc
 Rafi's voice started echoing in the background
 shammi kapur to rafi kii aawaaj se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone apane har gane main rafi kaa istemaal kiya
 While OP Nayyar gave music for him, Shankar Jaikishan sometimes voiced his voice
 chaahe koi mujhe junglee kahe, ehsaan tera hoga mujhapar, ye chand sa roshan cheharaa, divaana hua badal shammi kapur ke upar filmaae gaye lokapriy gaanon main shaamil hai
 Gradually, his fame grew so much that actors started urging him to sing the song
 rajendra kumaar, dilip kumaar or dharmendra to maanate hi nahin the ki koi or gayak unke liye gaae
 
 1950 ke dashak main shankar jaykishan, naushaad tathaa sachindev burman ne rafi se us samay ke bahut lokapriy geet gavaaye
 This trend continued into the 1960s
 sangeetkaar ravi ne mohammad rafi kaa istemaal 1960 ke dashak main kiya
 In 1960, Rafi received his first Filmfare Award for the title song of the movie Chaudhvi Ka Chand
 iske baad gharaana, kaajal, do badan tathaa neelkamal jaisi filmo main in dono kii jodi ne kai yaadgaar nagamen die
 In 1961 Rafi got his second Filmfare Award for Sasural's song Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko
 sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant pyarelal ne apana aagaaz hi rafi ke swar se kiya or 1963 main film parasmani ke liye bahut sundar geet banaae
 Be safe in these and it is remarkable when remembered
 1965 main hi lakshmi-pyaare ke sangeet nirdesan main film dosti ke liye gaae geet chaahunga mai tuje sanjh savere ke liye rafi ko teesraa filmphere puraskaar mila
 In 1965, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India

 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman se gane record karwaane ko kaha
 At that time Rafi went for Hajj
 panchamada ko apane priy gayak kishor kumaar se gavaane kaa mauka mila or unhone rup tera mastaana tathaa mere sapanom kii rani gane kishor da kii aawaaj main record karavaaya
 Both these songs became very popular and actor Rajesh Khanna of this song became very popular among the directors and public
 saath hi gayak kishor kumaar bhi janata tathaa sangeet nirdeshkon kii pehali pasand ban gaye
 After this the expiration of Rafi's singer life began
 hanlanki iske baad bhi unhone kai hit gane diye, jaise ye duniya ye mehfil, ye jo chilman he, tum jo mil gaye ho
 In 1977, he received the sixth and final Filmfare Award of his life for the song Kya Hua Tera Vaada of the film Hum Kisi Sekhon Nahi

 During the time of independence, he preferred to stay in India during Partition

 Mohammed Rafi is also known for his greatness
 wo bahut hansmukh or dariyadil the tathaa hameshaa sabaki madad ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 He sang many film songs without taking any money or with very little money
 apane shuruaati dinon main sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant-pyarelal ke liye unhone bahut kam paison main gaaya tha
 His dispute with Lata Mangeshkar over the royalty of the songs is also indicative of his generosity
 us samay lataji kaa kahana tha ki gane gane ke baad bhi un gaanon se hone vaali aamadani kaa ek ansh gayakon tathaa gayikaon ko milanaa chahie
 Rafi saheb was against this and said that once the songs have been recorded and the singer-singers have been paid their fees, they should not expect any more money
 is baat ko lekar dono mahaan kalakaaron ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 Lata refused to sing on the set with Rafi and for years no duet song came out
 baad main abhinetri naragis ke kehane par hi dono ne saath gaanaa chaalu kiya or jewel thief film main dil pukaare gaanaa gaaya
 He died due to cardiac arrest on 31 July 1980
 rafi ne apane jivan main kul kitne gane gaae is par kuch vivaad he
 In the 1970s, the Guinness Book of World Records wrote that Lata Mangeshkar was responsible for recording the most songs, recording a total of 25,000 songs
 rafi ne iskaa khandan karte hue gineez book ko ek chitthee likhi
 Subsequent editions featured the claims of the two singers simultaneously and credited Muhammad Rafi for recording 28,000 songs between 1944 and 1980
 iske baad hui khoj main vishwaas nerurkar ne paaya ki lata ne vastav main 1989 tak keval 5,044 gane gaae the
 Other researchers have also accepted this fact as true
 iske atirikt raju bharatan ne paaya ki 1948 or 1987 ke bich keval 35,000 hindi gane ricard hue
 It is difficult to believe that Rafi sang 28,000 songs, but some sources still cite this number

 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java , only one and a half eighty-one verses of the song are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems

 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically
 jaise newton ke pehle bhi gurutvkarshan kaa bal kaary karata tha kintu newton ne uganukool shabdaawalee dekar ise vishwa ko "gurutvkarshan ke niyam" ke ghoshit siddhanton se avgat karaayaa, jo newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 
 Shreemadbhagvatgeeta ka bhashya sambhavatah sanskrit ke vyakaranacharya paanini krit astadhayi se prerit hai parantu vibhinah purva ke paandulipi ke samuchit adhyan dwara vishesh arth nikala ja sakta hai
 Sampoorna Bhagwat Geeta PDF in Hindi and Sanskrit rogi kii seva-shushrusha ko paricharya yaa nursing kehete hai
 The word nurse in English means 'nutrition'
 nurse vah stri hoti he jo shishu kaa poshan karti he; maan bhi ek prakaar se nurse he, vah purush bhi nurse he jo shishuon kii athwa rogi kii dekhbhaal karata he
 Activism is reflected by the word care
 yah upkaar kaa kaam he or aise vyakti ke liye kiya jaataa he jo swayan use apane liye nahin kar saktaa
 Thus care is a profession, but it requires characterful women who are firm in the divine rules and who are firm on the principles of truth and do whatever is appropriate, no matter what the situation, regardless of the outcome
 
 paricharya kaa itihaas vedon ke pracheen kaal se aarambh hota he, jab rugan vyakti kii dekhbhaal tathaa shushrusha kaa kaary samaaj main bade aadar kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha

 Proficient in laying and cleaning, should be prompt, patient, skilled and obedient in the care of the afflicted
 yashasvi unani chikitsak hippocraties, jise aushadhashastra kaa pita mana jaataa he, rogi kii thik prakaar se dekhbhaal kii mahatta jaanata tha or vah yah bhi bhalee bhanti jaanata tha ki acchhee paricharya kaise kii jaani chahie
