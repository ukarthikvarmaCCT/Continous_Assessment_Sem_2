 a republic or republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter", not a private institution or property of rulers

 As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word "republic" as part of their official name - not all these republics by the meaning of elected governments, nor "republic" in the names of all nations with elected governments
 The term is used
 bhale rajyapramukh aksar yah daawa karte hai ki ve "shasiton kii sahmati" se hi shashan karte hai, nagarikon ko apane swayan ke netaaon ko chunane kii vaastavik kshamta ko uplabdh karaane ke asli uddeshy ke badale kuch deshon main chunaav "sho" ke uddeshy se adhik paaya gaya he

 Dictatorships, such as Hitler's Nazism, Mussolini's Fascism, Pakistan and many other countries have republican dictatorships, China, Communist dictatorships in the Soviet Union, etc
 are republics, because their head of state is or was a common man
 lekin in rajyon main loktantrik chunaav nahin hote, janata or vipaksh ko dabaaya jaataa he or janata kii ichha se shashan nahin chalata
 Some such countries are: har loktantr kaa ganraajya hona aavashyak nahin he
 Constitutional monarchies, where the head of state is a hereditary monarch, but the real regime runs a parliament elected by the Janta, fall into this category
 aise kuch desh hai : In ancient times, there have been two types of states
 ek rajadheen or duusare ganadhin
 Rajadhin was also called monolithic
 jahaan gana yaa anek vyaktiyon kaa shashan hota tha, ve hi ganadhin rajya kehalaate the
 In this particular sense Panini's explanation is clear and sure
 unhone gana ko sangh kaa paryaay kaha he 
 It is known from literature that there were many republics during the period of Panini and Buddha
 tirhut se lekar kapilwastu tak ganraajyon kaa ek chota sa guchha ganga se tarai tak failaa hua tha
 The Buddha was born in the Shakyaganas
 lichchhaviyon kaa ganraajya inamen sabase shaktishaalee tha, uski rajdhani vaishali thi
 But the largest expansion of republics in India was in the Wahik region
 uttar pashchim ke in ganraajyon ko panini ne aayudhjivi sangh kaha he
 They are also known as the Negotiable Association of Economics
 ye log shantical main vaarta yaa krishi aadi par nirbhar rahete the kintu yudhkaal main apane samvidhan ke anusaar yoddha banakar sangram karte the
 Their political composition was very firm and relatively developed
 inamen kshudrak or maalav do ganraajyon kaa vishesh ullekh aata he
 He fought fiercely with Yavana Akranta Alexander
 vah malwon ke baan se to ghayal bhi ho gaya tha
 For the combined army of these two, Panini mentions the noun Kodudrakamalvi in the Ganpath
 punjab ke uttarpashchim or uttarpurv main bhi anek chote mote ganraajya the, unka ek shrunkhala trigart ke pahari pradesh main vistaarit hua tha jinhen parvatiy sangh kehete the
 The second series was that of the Mahabhalashali castes who settled in the Girigahvars on both banks of the Indus River, which in ancient times were called the Graminik Sangh
 ve hi vartmaan ke kabyli hai

 The body is mortal, the soul is immortal, this immortality is associated with salvation, and to attain this salvation, it is also necessary to make effort for the meaning and work
 is prakaar bhartiya samskruti main dharm or moksh aadhyatmik sandesh evam arth or kaam kii bhautik anivaaryta paraspar sambaddh he
 This syncretism of spirituality and materiality reflects the specific concept of Indian culture, which was created by Indian mystics to make this folk and the hereafter happy
 sukhi maanav-jivan ke liye aisi chintaa vishwa kii anya samskritiyaan nahin karatin
 Through the complete genres of literature, music and art, this spiritual and physical co-ordination of Indian culture can be easily understood

 sangeet ke saat swar or nrity ke trital sampoorn bharat main samaan rup se prachlit hai
 India is a continent of many religions, sects, beliefs and different beliefs and beliefs, however its cultural set and the nature of unity in diversity has been a matter of astonishment for other countries of the world

 It embodies the definitive paradigms of human behavior acquired and conveyed by symbols
 samskruti kaa aprihaary abhyantar kalkram main pradurbhoot evam sanchit paramparaagat vichaaron or tatsambaddha mulyon dwaara nirmit hota he
 One side of it relates to the determination of human behavior and the other side to the authenticity and justification of certain lawful practices
 prayek samskruti main chayankshmata evam varanaatmakataa ke saamaanya siddhanton kaa sannivesh hota he, jinke madhyam se saanskriti aadhey ke naanaa rup kshetron main maanavvyavahaar ke pratimaan samanyikaran dwaara avakaraneey hote hai

 As a result, civilization overtakes culture in development

 There are three types of crimes against human beings in society, namely, towards life, towards the body, or to freedom
 manushya ke jivan ke prati kiye janevaale aparaadh chaar prakaar ke hote hai - narhatya, aatmahatya, bhrunahatya or shishuhatya
 The slaughter of another human by another human is called homicide
 pracheen kaal main narhatya ke sabhi maamalon main ek sa dand diya jaataa tha
 But with the birth of higher emotions and the development of the theory of criminal psychology in the modern period, there is a difference in the criminal system of the perpetrators of murder
 aadhunik dharanaon ke anusaar narhatya yaa to vaid hoti he yaa avaidh 
 Legitimate homicide is either excusable or justified
 bina kisi aparadhaatmak iraade ke durghatana yaa durbhagyavash ; athwa In case of insanity or intoxication by a child or a person with imbalanced mind; Or mritak ke hitarth kiye gaye sadbhavnapurna kaary dwaara honevaali narhatyaayein kshamya hoti hai
 Male slaughter is justified under the following conditions - kshamya or nyyochit narhatyaon ke maamalon main dand nahin diya jaataa or isiilie aisi hatyaayein vaid kehalaati hai
 Prosecutive homicide either falls under the category of murder or does not fall under the category of murder
 yadi koi vyakti jaan se maar daalane ke iraade se athwa aisi shaareerik chot pahunchaane ke iraade se jisase mrityu sambhav ho athwa yah jaanate hue ki uske aise kaary se mrityu kii sambhaavna ho sakati he, mrityu kaa kaaran banataa he to aisa vyakti abhiyojya narhatya kaa aparaadh karata he 
 It is necessary for the prosecution of any one of the above three elements to commit murder
 is prakaar yadi nishchit iraade or jaankaree se kisi kii hatya ho jaati he to yah abhiyojya narhatya hogi
 But if death happens without any such intention or knowledge, then it will not be a prosecution
 durbhaavna athwa bura iraadaa iske liye aavashyak nahin he
 For example, if one intends to kill or with the knowledge that death is possible from his work, he puts thin wood and grass on top of a pit and, considering it to be a solid ground, goes over it, falls and dies
 Ta a is the culprit of this murder
 pun:, a jaanata he ki ja jhaadi ke peeche he, va yah neen jaanata
 Motives b to shoot at the bush with the intention of killing Aj
 va goli chalaa detaa he or ja maaraa jaataa he
 It can be innocent here and there, but a prosecutor commits murder
 isi prakaar a fakhta kaa shikaar kar usko churaane ke uddeshy se goli chalaata he jisase jhaadi ke peeche khadey ba kii mrityu ho jaati he
 a did not know that b was standing there
 yahan yadhyapi a ek avaidh kaary kar rahaa tha lekin vah abhiyojya narhatya kaa apradhi nahin he kyonki uskaa iraadaa jaan lene kaa nahin tha or na vah jaanata tha ki uske is kaary se kisi kii mrityu ho sakati he
 From this illustration it is established that if a criminal commits a crime, he causes someone to die when he did not have such intention nor did he know that such an act could lead to death, then such a person should only Punishment will be given for the same offense, not for accidental killing
 abhiyojya narhatya kaa astitv kisi vishesh aparaadh ke rup main nahin he
 It is used in its original sense and that is why the Indian Penal Code does not have a penal law for it
 yah do prakaar kaa hota he
 That is, prosecutorial homicide which falls in the category of murder and prosecutable homicide which does not fall in the category of murder
 angreji vidhi ke antargat duusare ko maanavwadh kehete hai
 Prosecutive homicide is considered murder if the act that led to the death- praan lene ke iraade se kiya jaataa he ; athwa If the act is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury that the offender knows that the person who will be hurt is likely to die; Or yadi vah kaary kisi vyakti ko shaareerik chot pahunchaane ke iraade se kiya jaataa he or is prakar pahunchaai janevaali chot swaabhaavik rup se mrityu kaa kaaran banane ke liye paryaapt he ; athwa If the person doing that work knows that his work is so dangerous that in every case it has full chances of death or he inflicts a physical injury which is likely to cause death and raises the risk of taking life without any reason
 k does such an act or causes such injury
 udhaahranswaroop a akaaran manushyon kii ek bheed par bhari hui bandook chalaata he or unamem ek vyakti ko jaan se maar detaa he
 In such a case, a is guilty of murder, though he may not have had any predetermined plan to kill a particular person
 vah isliye hatya kaa apradhi kaha jayega kyonki uskaa kaary asann rup se itnaa khatarnaak he ki isse prayek dasha main mrityu hogi 
 a crime will not fall under the category of murder unless it falls under the definition of prosecutorial homicide because the definition of self-murder indicates conditions in which the prosecutorial homicide cannot fall under the category of homicide
 udhaahranswaroop jab vah dhara 300 ke paanch apwaadon main se kisi ek ke antargat aa jaati he
 There was a time when it was understood that the difference between prosecutorial homicide and murder is only five exceptions to section 300
 lekin ab yah nishchit ho chukaa he ki donon main antar he yadhyapi unamem koi amul antar nahin he
 To know is common in both
 jis kaary se mrityu hoti he vah apradhi kaa kaary he or donon sthitiyon main aparaadhik iraadaa athwa jaankaree anivaary he
 The real difference is in the relativity of intention or information
 abhiyojya narhatya kii apeksha hatya main ghaatak prahaar karne kaa iraadaa athwa jaankaree adhik rahati he
 In all cases of killing, these two crimes are neither outsiders nor extender
 saamanyat: jab iraadaa praan lene kaa hota he to kiya gaya aparaadh hatya he, yadi vah dhara 300 ke paanch apwaadon main kisi ke antargat nahin aata
 If a knows that B's spleen is enlarged and with the knowledge of the fact that a punches him powerfully in the area of his spleen and b dies, it is a crime murder, not a prosecution, because a had special knowledge
 pun:, yadi shaareerik chot se mrityu sambhavit he to yah abhiyojya narhatya he
 Whereas if there is an intention to inflict bodily injury which is normally enough to kill, it will be murder
 duusare shabdon main, yadi kiye gaye kaary kaa parinaam samast sambhavit dashaon main mrityu he to yah hatya he jab ki yadi mrityu hone kii sambhaavna maatr he to aparaadh abhiyojya narhatya he
 The definition of homicide, which does not fall under the category of murder, or English law, is neither defined nor required
 iske antargat do prakaar ke aparaadh aate hai : Those who are subject to prosecutorial homicide but not within the definition of murder; And ve jo dhara 300 ke paanch apwaadon ke antargat aate hai
 We will first illustrate the first type of cases
 yadi koi kaary shaareerik chot pahunchaane ke iraade se kiya jaataa he jisase mrityu hone kii sambhaavna he to yah maanavwadh he
 For example, a slaps his wife with full power
 falswaroop vahi gir padati he or mar jaati he
 There is no evidence that she was ill
 aisi dasha main a maanavwadh kaa apradhi he
 If there is a lack of intention to die and the result of the investigation is that the work was done with the knowledge that there was a possibility of death from it, then it is a homicide
 udhaahranswaroop jab luutane ke aparaadh main aasaani paidaa karne ke liye kisi ko datura khilaa diya jaataa he jisase uski mrityu ho jaati he to yah aparaadh maanavwadh he
 Sometimes it becomes difficult to ascertain when a person kills someone he considers dead in order to hide the mark of his crime
 udhaahranswaroop a, ba ko jaan se maarane ke iraade se uske sir par teen prahaar karata he
 As a result, b falls unconscious even though he is not dead
 a usko mrit samajhakar aparaadh ke saare pramaan nasht karne ke liye us jhopadi main aag laga detaa he jisamen ba padaa he
 Doctor's evidence is that death is caused by burns, not by strikes
 bombai ucch nyaayalay ne "samrat banaam khand' main bahumat se yah nirnay diya tha ki a hatya karne ke praytn kaa apradhi he, hatya kaa nahin
 Disagreeing judge Mr
 Parson determined him to be the perpetrator of the murder on the grounds that both the act of striking and burning the hut were so closely related to each other that they were part of the same process - killing the deceased
 hamaare desh ke anek ucch nyaayalayon ne nyaayadhish shri parson ke is mat kaa samarthan kiya he or jisko privi concil ne "meri banaam maharani' 1
