 Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray may have a bad reputation

 Significantly, at the first joint rally of the Shiv sena-bjp on Friday, Uddhav Thackeray spoke abusive words to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 is bhaashan kii jaanch ke baad mumbai city colector ne apni prathmik jaanch me ise aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan mana or police ko maamle kii jaanch kar karwai karne ko kaha he
 However, Shiv Sena says that they have not received any notice in this matter yet
 vahiin emenes ke adhyaksh raaj thakare par pehle hi nasik main bhadakaau bhaashan dene kaa maamla darj ho chukaa he
 In this connection, he met the Election Commission with some more problems but after meeting, he made fun of the whole process
 raaj bhale hi majaak me kah rahe hon kii wo sarkaar ke laadle hai isiliye unpar barbar cese darj hote hai par is baar donon hi thakare bhaiyon par galat bayani ke liye maamle darj hue hai
 However, the election campaign is just beginning, if the Thackeray brothers do not control their tongue, then they will continue to have less Election Commission and more rounds of courts with the voters

 birla ne daawa kiya ki in i-commers companiyon main nivesh karne waalon par ek na ek din nivesh par mil rahe ritern ko badhaane kaa dabaav banegaa kyonki vah bhi ek str tak hi bazaar main capital pravaah kar sakate hai
 In an interview to an English business newspaper, Birla said, 'I wonder how e-commerce can be run in this way

 One day the financial investor of these businesses will also need a return

 Pollution is becoming a common problem in Delhi, the country's capital
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki rajya kii sarkaar yaa agenciyaan pradooshan kii alag-alag vajahon se nipatane ke liye koi thos plan banane main asamarth nazar aa rahi hai
 Meanwhile, just before the winter season, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has sought the support of neighboring states to tackle pollution
 dilli main pradooshan badhane ke peeche kai gharelu vajahen pramukh hai
 Despite this, for the past several years, the government and all agencies focus more on emergency steps rather than dealing with the problem of pollution completely
 aapako bataate hai ki abtak uparajyapal daphtar, sarkaar or agenciyon ne pradooshan se nipatane ke liye kin-kin taiyaariyon ko anjaam diya:-13 agast ko pradooshan kii samasya par uparajyapal dilli ke paryaavaran mantri imran hossain, dilli nagar nigam or anya adhikariyon ke saath baithak kii thi
 The Deputy Governor has given the DPCC a deadline till 30 September 2018 to convert industrial areas into PNG
 haalanki vaahanon ke pradooshan yaa khule main kooda jalaane par koi charchaa hui yaa nahin isaki jaankaree uparajyapal daphtar kii taraf se saajha nahin hui
 Kejriwal government has tried formulas like Odd during his rule
 china kii tarj par foging mashin kaa bhi test bhi sarkaar kar chuki he
 Also, preparations are on to bring electronic buses, but by when will these buses come, this is a big question
 -khule main kooda jalaane se rokane, nirmaandhin imaaraton ke aasapaas pradooshan ko rokane or sadakon-pedo par jami dhul ko hataane kii ahm zimmedaari agenciyon kii hoti he
 Information about what the plans and preparations of the agencies are also not revealed
 filhal mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit kar dilli ke padosi rajyon kii sarkaar se saath dene kii apil kii he
 He said that the Delhi government and the people of Delhi are trying to tackle pollution
 dilli main pradooshan kii samasya gharelu nahin he or yah samasya sirf padosi rajyon kii aapasi sahyog se dur ho sakati he
 Aaj Tak interacted with environmental expert Vimalendu Jha on pollution coming from neighboring states in Delhi
 unhone bataaya ki paraali jalaane kii vajah se sirf 20 se 25 dinon tak pradooshan badhata he
 The government of the neighboring states of Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will have to come together to deal with the problem of stubble
 kisaanon ko paraali na jalaane ke liye fund bhi diya jaataa he, lekin kya sabhi rajyon ke mantrigan ek kamare main baithkar charchaa karte hai? haalanki asal samaadhaan dhundne kii bajaay sirf raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Question -1 from Delhi government and agencies
 vaahanon kaa pradooshan ko kam karne ke liye kya koi khaas kadam uthaaya gaya?2
 Was any plan made to control dust pollution in Delhi? 3
 dilli main kooday jalane se 20% pradooshan failata he, isse nipatane kii kya taiyaari hui?4
 According to a report, there is a shortage of 9 lakh trees in Delhi
 is kami ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar kya kar rahi he?paryaavaran jaankaar vimalendu jha kaa kahana he ki samasya kii jaankaree hone ke baavjood sarkaar or agenciyaan pradooshan ke liye gambhir nahin he
 Vimalendu Jha said that for the last several years, the government's own report shows that the reason for pollution is with us
 vaahanon se 30% se 40% pradooshan hota he, lagbhag 20% se 30% pradooshan hawa main dhul kii maatra badhane se hota he
 Apart from this, pollution is spread due to burning of garbage in open and thermal factories
 paryaavaran jaankaron ke mutabik pradooshan badhane ke peeche dilli kii gharelu samasyaayein hai, jisase nipatane ke liye sarkaar or agenciyon ne thos kadam nahin uthaaen hai
 From 2015 to 2018, Delhi has no concrete plan to tackle pollution
 jaankaron kaa sawaal he ki kya sarkaar ne pichley 36 maheene main koi aisa kadam uthaaya he jisase 2018 kii sardiyon main bhayaavah pradooshan se bachaa ja sake

 The formation of a Shiv Sena government after the announcement of Congress support after the NCP is almost certain
 aise main kumaar vishwaas (kumar Vishvas) ne apane andaaj main media ko sawaalon ke ghere main lete hue bijepi (BJP) par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Kumar Vishwas wrote on his Twitter account that on several previous occasions in the states of Haryana, Bihar, Kashmir, Karnataka, etc
, the discussion and chakravarti anchors of the channels, calling the opportunistic and unethical alliances made by each party a "master-stroke"
 How cute it is to listen to the "discourse on morality" on the pretext of Maharashtra
 pichley anek avasaron par haryana, bihar, kashmir, karnataka aadi pradeshon main, prayek dal dwaara kiye gaye mauqaaprast va aniatik gathbandhanon ko “master-stroke” bataate aa rahe channelon ke charchaa-chakravarti ankaron ke munh se maharashtra ke bahaane “naitikta par pravachan” sunanaa kitna kute lag rahaa he xxrep 16 ? gaur ho ki jin pradeshon kaa zikr kumaar vishwaas ne apane twit main kiya he un sabhi rajyon main bijepi kisi na kisi dal ke saath satta main he yaa phir satta menrah chuki he
 During the recent assembly elections in Haryana, BJP formed an alliance with Dushyant Chautala's party Jananayak Janata Party
 iske alaava bihar main bijepi jediu ke saath satta main he to kashmir main bijepi ne kabhi pidipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai thi vahiin baat karankarnataka kii to, aapako bataa den kikaphi uthapatak ke baad bijepi satta par kabiz hone main kaamyaab ho pai thi
 In such a situation, the direction of Kumar Vishwas can be estimated
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav me bijepi ko 105, shivasena ko 56, ensipi ko 54 or congress ko 44 siten mili hai
 The BJP and Shiv Sena together crossed the 145 mark
 lekin shivasena ne 50-50 formule kii maang rakh di jiske mutabik dhai-dhai saal sarkaar chalaane kaa model tha
 Shiv Sena says that the agreement with BJP was done on this formula but BJP claims that no such agreement was reached

 Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a subsidiary organization of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has written a letter to PM Modi demanding ban on Chinese social media apps like Tick Talk and removal from all mobile phones
 manch ne jaish-e-mohammad ke pramukh masood ajahar ko global tebrist ghoshit karne main madad na karne vaale china ko 'dushman desh' bataate hue kaha he ki bharat main sabhi chini companiyon or chini ap par tatkaal ankush lagaaya jaae
 This statement of Swadeshi Jagran Manch came four days after the martyrdom of 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir
 iconomic times ke anusaar piem modi ko likhe apane letters main sanghathan ne kaha he ki yah sabhi bharatiyon kaa daayitv he ki kisi aise desh yaa vyakti ko hone vaale aarthik phaaydon ko roke jo pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se aatankwaadiyon kaa samarthan karata ho
 Swadeshi Jagran Manch said in its statement, 'at such a time, we believe that the government stops the way of Chinese companies, who are using India for their benefit
 jaisaa ki aksar kaha jaataa he ki data ab nayaa tel he, isliye hamen chini companiyon ko is baat kii ijaajat nahin deni chahie ki ve bina kisi rokatoke yaa nigaraanee ke bhartiya yujar hasil kar saken
 'it is worth noting that the Government of India has also recently proposed to bring such a policy, so that intermediary apps that make content sharing easier on social media platforms can be made more accountable
 isse china ke kai soshal media ap par asar hoga jo desh ke kishoron main kaaphi lokapriy hai
 One such app popular among teenagers, Tik Tok (tik Tok) has about 200 million users in India, while its total users in the whole world are 500 million
 pichley kuch varshon main desh main chini soshal media or i-commers companiyon kaa vistaar teji se hua he or jaankaar ise rashtriya suraksha ke lihaaj se uchit nahin maanate
 Apps like Tic Toc and Halo are said to be able to promote child pornography and anti-national activities
 swadeshi jaagran manch ne apane letters main likhaa he, 'hamen yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki aise chini companiyon kii vajah se bhartiya starop ko nuksaan na ho
 Chinese companies have a lot of cash and because of this they can damage the system of Indian startups
 yahi nahin, ve hamaari data prabhusatta or hamaari rashtriya suraksha ko bhi khatra pahunchaa sakate hai
 The organization said that the Indian government would also have to curb the business of Chinese telecom companies in the country
 iske mutabik, chini companiyon ne bharat main kai mahatvapurn or sanvadensheel 4ji contract hasil kar liye hai or ab 5ji sector main bhi jagah banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This will increase the security risk manifold

 (input ieenes se) Prime Minister Narendra Modi ended his first visit to Bhutan today after taking office, which was described as extremely successful
 unhone bhutan tathaa anya padosi deshon ko sandesh diya ki majboot or samrudh bharat unke hit main he
 The two-day visit of this small country was taken by the Prime Minister of India with the aim of strengthening the relationship between the two countries which includes security interests and cooperation in many fields
 udhar, bhutan ne apane kshetra kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf nahin hone dene kaa vaayada kiya
 This assurance was given against the backdrop of the militants of the Northeast taking refuge in this country

 Modi later tweeted that the yatra will remain on his memory
 unhone dilli vaapasi par apane twit main likhaa, 'bhutan kii yah yatra meri yaadon main bani rahegi
 It has been a very satisfying and positive journey
 ' Earlier addressing the joint session of the National Assembly of Bhutan, Modi said that a strong Bhutan would benefit India in the same way that a strong and prosperous India would be beneficial for the countries of the region, especially the SAARC countries
 unhone kaha, 'bharat kii khushhaali mahatvapurn he kyonki yah chote deshon kii madad kar saktaa he or ek achche padosi kaa apana daayitv nibhaa saktaa he
 But if India will be weak and remain entangled in its problems, how can it help others

 Pakistan head of terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) Hafiz Mohammad Saeed died in an explosion while planting a roadside bomb plant
 ghatana pakistan ke pashchimottar kabyli ilaake kii he
 According to reports, Saeed and two of his accomplices were planting bombs in the Tura Dara area of tirah Valley in Khyber tribal area on Friday when it exploded
 suraksha balon kaa daawa he ki visphot main ek vyakti maaraa gaya jo pakistan aies kaa pramukh tha
 However, the terrorist organization IS has not confirmed this
 saidtaharik-e-taliban pakistan(titipi) ke paanch pramukh cmanderon main se ek tha, jinhone pratibandhit sanghathan se pichley saal aktubar main alag hone kaa elaan kiya tha
 The faction, led by former TTP spokesperson Shaheedullah Shahid, joined the IS
 aies ke sheersh netritv ne pichley saal ek sandesh jari kar said kopakistan ke liye aiesapramukh ghoshit kiya tha
 On one side, Team India kept slipping, and in such a situation, the words of former England captain Nasir Hussain were also slipped
 team india kii karaab filding dekhte dekhte us vakt camentry kar rahe nasir ne bhartiya filder ko ‘gadhaa’ kah daalaa
 Read Tim Bresnan said, Team India will beat India 5-0 in odis, seeing the ball slipped from the hands of Indian fielders, Nasir Hussain's tongue also slipped
 bhartiya fielding kii khastahal dekh nasir aise bahake kii unhone bhartiya fielderon ko aisa kah daalaa jise bayaan karne main hamen bhi jhijak hogi
 Nasir made this commentary when the fifth over of England's innings was going on
 usase pehle vaale over main parthiv ke haath se kaich phisal gaya tha
 Read: The only Twenty20 from England also lost after listening to Nasir from Team Indiagore, it seemed that he was talking about the players who always look dull on the field
 aise hi ek fielder rohit sharma he jo aksar camentator ke nishane par rahete hai
 In such a situation, know which player Nasser was pointing to, after listening to his commentary, many eyebrows have certainly been raised in India
 nasir ne jo kaha use ek comenttor kii maryaada main to nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But the English media once compared the poor performance of Indian players on this tour and called them a dog
 yani ab ham itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki bhartiya khilaadiyon kii izzat unke apane haathon main he
 Jaitley had said that Modi is willing to talk to everyone to get this historic indirect tax law passed
 vitt mantri ne kaha tha ki unhone is mudde par lagbhag sabhi congress netaaon se baat kii he
 He had said, "we have absolutely no hesitation at the level of the Prime Minister
" naa pehle kabhi thi or naa ab he
 He (PM Modi) is keen to talk to everyone
 ’’ congress ne sansad ke pichley satr main jiesti samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko is maang ke chalate paarit nahin hone diya tha ki isamen ek rajasav-nirpeksh dar kaa ullekh ho jo 18 pratishat se adhik nahin ho
 The opposition party is also opposed to giving states the right to levy an additional tax of one percent above the GST rate on the supply of goods
 sadan main bolne kaa paryaapt samay na die jane ko mudda banaakar 18 july ko rajyasabha se istipha dene vaali bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii rashtriya adhyaksh apni ranneeti ko nayaa rup dene kii taiyaari kar chuki thim
 Five days later, on 23 July, Mayawati called a meeting of all senior leaders, including the party's National and State Working Committee members, at the bsp's central office at Gurdwara Rakabganj Road in New Delhi
 isamen uttar pradesh ke netaaon ko do hafte ke bheetar party ke vot bank or jamini kaaryakartaaon ke bich jaakar bhavishya main kisi prakaar ke gathbandhan ke bare main raay lene kaa jimmaa bhi saunpa gaya
 Two weeks later, on May 10, at the bsp's state office in Lucknow's Mall Avenue, when party officials and senior leaders gathered, Mayawati asked all the leaders one by one about the alliance and ways to strengthen the party
 - Almost all the answers were against the alliance
 iske baad mayawati ne gathbandhan or patna main 27 april ko yojit hone vaali rashtriya janata dal (rajd) netaa lalu yadav kii mahareli par chuppi saadh lee
 a tweet handle of young leaders close to a senior party leader who supported the BSP a day before the rally, the party's bigwigs swung into action after tweeting a poster featuring mayawati-akhilesh
 aanan-fanan main twitor account se na keval poster hataaya gaya balki yah account bhi band kar diya gaya
 After this, the speculation of Mayawati not attending Lalu Yadav rally intensified
 raily ke thik 72 ghante pehle mayawati ne lakhanu ke apane awaas se patna kii raily main shaamil na hone kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Mayawati said, "the BSP will share a platform with any regional or national level party only when it is decided which of the parties with secular alliances will contest the seats
 gathbandhan kaa bananaa yaa bigadsa puri tarah se siton ke bantwaare par nirbhar karata he
 "in the guise of seat sharing, Mayawati has tried to make the BSP stand out from the opposing opposition parties as part of a well thought out strategy
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main bhim army ke badhate prabhaav or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii dalit matadaataaon ko lubhaane kii nirantar koshishon ke bich mayawati gathbandhan kii baat karke apane kor matadaataaon ke bich rakshaatmak hone kaa sandesh nahin dena chaahatin
 Mayawati's strategy is to aggressively "cash" the anti-incumbency in favor of the BSP, not to talk of an alliance
 vipakshi ekta par grahasadan main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke bhaashan ke virodh main 24 july ko vipakshi ekta kii ek misaal dekhne ko mili
 Opposition parties boycotting the assembly ran a parallel house in the Central Hall of the Vidhan Bhavan
 vidhansabha main basapa vidhayak dal ke netaa lalji verma sadan ke adhyaksh bane to netaa sadan kii jimmedaari congress vidhanmandal dal ke netaa ajay kumaar singh urf lallu ne nibhaai
 SP leader Ramgovind Chaudhary was present as the Leader of the Opposition
 is pratikatmak sadan main jis tarah se sapa, basapa, congress, rashtriya lokdal ke sadsy maujuud rahe, usne pradesh main vipakshi ekta ke paravaan chadhgaye kaa sanket nja kiya
 Just a month after this, the manner in which Mayawati has consistently beaten the seat-sharing condition with the alliance, she has made a dent in the opposition unity in Uttar Pradesh
 sapa ke mukhya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kehete hai ''basapa se gathbandhan ko lekar sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne kabhi koi sambhaavna prakat nahin kii
 SP will contest all the 80 seats in the state in the next Lok Sabha elections
 " udhar congress ke varisht netaaon ne bhi apane sheersh netritv ko upi main kisi prakaar kaa gathbandhan na karne kaa suzav diya he
 State Congress President Raj Babbar says, "the alliance with SP in UP was only till the assembly elections
 bhavishya main duusare dalon se gathjod par koi vichaar nahin ho rahaa he
 "lalu Yadav's proposal to send Mayawati to the Rajya Sabha with the support of the RJD is also negative in the attitude of the top BSP leaders
 party ke ek varisht netaa or vidhayak bataate hai, ''bahan ji kaa rajyasabha yaa loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 She wants to focus only on the party till the next election
 " jaahir he ki rajyasabha se istipha dene ke baad mayawati apane kor matadaataaon ke bich vaisaa hi mahaul bananaa chaahati hai jaisaa 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main satta paane se pehle tha
 BSP, which has lost alliances in the last three elections, will also try its hand in Uttar Pradesh's civic elections this time
 2000 ke baad duusari baar basapa nikaay chunaav main apane simbel par ladegi
 The BSP will fight the elections not with any alliance but alone
 is chunaav ke bahaane basapa ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apane matadaataaon kii nabj tatolane kii ranneeti taiyaar kii he
 The party has started preparations on a war footing for a strong performance in these elections to be held after two months
 lakhanu main basapa jiladhyaksh ech
 K
 gautam bataate hai, ''ward or nagar cametiyon kaa gathan lagbhag puraa ho chukaa he
 The party will declare its candidate as soon as the list of reservations in the wards is final
 " nikaay chunaav ke liye basapa ne khaas ranneeti taiyaar kii he
 After the assembly elections, Mayawati has renewed the organization from the bsp's zone to the district
 jonal koordinator kaa pad samaapt karte hue jone incharge tainaat kiye hai
 Two districts have been made in-charge in each district
 mayawati ne jone incharge kii nigaraanee main hi nikaay chunaav ladgaye kii taiyaari kii he
 In the formation of ward committees under the supervision of mlas and former assembly candidates, the BSP has paid attention to its grassroots activists who have been devoted to the party from the beginning
 lakhanu main ek ward cameti ke adhyaksh bataate hai, ''prayek ward main basapa ke un puraane kaaryakartaaon se sampark saadhaa ja rahaa he jo kinhin kaarnon se yaa to sakriy nahin hai yaa phir duusari partiyon main chale gaye hai
 The grassroot cadre is being activated by giving such people an important role in civic elections
 " basapa har ward main aise prabhaavshaalee logon kii suchi taiyaar kara rahi he jo party kii vichaardhaara se ittefaq to rakhte hi hai, saath main nikaay chunaav ko bhi prabhavit kar sakate hai
 The names of such people will be sent to the top BSP functionaries through the Zone Incharge
 inhen main se kai ko nikaay chunaav main ummidavaar banane ke saath hi loksabhaa chunaav main bhi jimmedaari saunpi jaaegi
 Preparation to look ahead of the sp-congress Professor of Sociology Department at Banaras Hindu University (BHU)
 ajit kumaar kehete hai, ''mayawati kaa rajyasabha se istipha swatahsfoort faisla nahin tha
 a far-reaching strategy was hidden behind it
 istife ke kuch hi dinon main puure pradesh ko reliyon ke jariye mathne kaa kaarykram ghoshit karnaa yah sabit karata he
 "actually the way the old bsp's old warlords are leaving the party one by one after the assembly elections, there is a dilemma among the party's Dalit voters
 isi se nibatane ke liye mayawati 18 sitambar se 18 may ke bich puure pradesh main nau badi reliyaan karke khiskate dalit vot bank ko waapas laane kii bharsak koshish karengi
 Through rallies, Mayawati will also try to show herself ahead of other opposition parties by presenting herself as Dalit, Adivasi, Backward, Muslim friendly
 sapa kaa sheersh netritv philhal mayawati se duuri bana kar chalanaa chaah rahaa he
 "if Mayawati is talking about seat sharing before the alliance, she should not have announced rallies across the state," says an SP member of the Legislative Council
 " mayawati par dabaav banane ke liye hi sapa ne kabhi basapa ke sabase kaddavar netaaon kii jamaat main rahe indrajit saroj ko party main shaamil karne kaa taana-bana buna he
 Apart from Saroj, who is out of the BSP after making serious financial allegations against Mayawati, Nasimuddin Siddiqui, the bsp's Muslim face, is also in the process of riding a bicycle
 vidhaan parishad main sapa ke varisht netaa ahamed hasan ke jariye nasimuddin siddiki kii sapa rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav se bhi mulaakaat ho chuki he
 In these circumstances, Mayawati wants to first assess the party's strength in Uttar Pradesh through the bsp's proposed rallies
 iske baad hi ve bhavishya kii ranneeti kaa taana-bana bunengi
 At the moment, his path is only for Ekla Chalo
