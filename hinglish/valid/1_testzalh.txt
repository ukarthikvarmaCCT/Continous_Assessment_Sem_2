 Dushyant kumar-virendra Khare of Bundelkhand 'alone' shaayari wo nahin jo kaagaz kaa seenaa siyaah kar de
 Shayari is one who engraves a twinge of words in the depths of the heart with the tender and delicate fingers of the realization, and such a poet keeps the lion alive, not his books, which have become a mark on people's hearts by smelling people's tongues
 
 yahi vajah he ki unke sher kahin bhi kisi kii bhi zubaani sunne ko mil jate hai
 'akela' Ji has shown ghazals, songs, muktak, chhand, couplets and azad nazme, the jauhars of his advice in every genre
 sabase pehle main unki ghazal kaa firruf karaata hoon
 Ghazal is a genre in which the poet says his heart in the words of his poetry in at least as many words as effectively as Uthanasayari is not possible in any other genre
 yani ek ghazal main agar saat sher hai to usamen alag alag saat mazamoon hai, saat alag alag bhavanaayen hai or us par bhi shaayar kii koshish ye he ki har mazamoon kii tah tak utarane kii koshish kare or apane har mazamoon ke saath samayin ko jodne kii puri koshish kare
 Once upon a time, Ghazals were considered the inheritance of the Persian people, whose houses were the court of emperors and Nawabs
 jiskaa kul saramaaya husno-ishq or najuk mizaaji hi hua karata tha
 The paths through which this ghazal had to come from Persian to Urdu, the same way, the Hindi ghazal had to take the path from Urdu ghazal to reach its place
 har acchhee chiz kisi kii miraas nahin hoti
 After all, how far could the palaces of emperors and Nawabs be able to tie such a good genre of Ghazal
 ghazal kii ye vidha jab aivaanon se nikal kar dilli kii sadakon par aayi to isane vahaan ke logon kii apni aam zabaan ko apanaaya
 Now it is very important to narrate such a special twist here, are we aware of the names of all the poets who were saying Ghazals from Persian? No, the names that are left of them today are not only the names of those poets who did not have a unique shayari, but they are those who speak from the Persian, the accents of the Persian ghazal, its tools and all its designs
 And when such people moved away from Persian and wrote poetry in Urdu, then they managed to fill the full color of Persian ghazal in Urdu ghazal and when the Persian right He had said he had heard of Urdu Ghazal and it read that yes sure it Ghazal
 sirf lafz badale hai ghazal kii aatma nahin badali
 Until the Urdu ghazal did not put itself to the test of Persian ghazal, these two miracles of Urdu did not reach the place of Ghazal
 ye baat bilkul samaj main aane vaali he ki agar kisi bhi zabaan kaa shaayar doha yaa koi savaiya likhe to use paimaana hindi vidha ke dohe yaa savaiye ko hi bananaa padegaa
 Its weight will also be on the same scale, and if it is not so, then no one has the right to decide any scale according to his own name and give him the name of Doha or Savaiya
 farsi daan logon ne us daur main urdu ghazal ko jo nakaara tha, uski asl vajah yahi thi or aaj bhi jo log hindi ghazal ko ghazal nahin maanate uski bhi asl vajah yahi he
 Most of the Ghazals of Hindi who are not aware of Urdu poetry, when they wrote Ghazals, did not stand the test of Ghazal and it was not accepted as Ghazal
 lekin kuch log aise bhi aaye jo galibo-mir kii zabaan se vaaqif the, ghazal jinaki aatma main saraayat thi, jo amir khusro se lekar bashir badr tak ke ghazal ke safar se vaaqif the or iske saath hi hindi bhashaa par bhi unka adhikaar tha
 When some such people did the same Hindi shayari with two misses, the Urdu people were also shocked and they said that it is ghazal
 aise shuru hui hindi ghazal; farsi se urdu kii tarah-urdu se hindi ghazal kaa ye mode bahut zaruri tha kyonki aaj kii avami zabaan waalon ko kaalis urdu samaj main aana mumkin nahin
 Necessity makes its own way and few people who are standing at the beautiful point of this path, whose literary breeds based on Shayari will make their own scale of Hindi Ghazal, one of the names is Virendra Khare 'akela'
 ab zaraa dekhen urdu ghazal ke nashebo-faraaz ‘akelaa’ sahab kii hindi ghazal main - Where is anyone able to see the happiness, never seeing anyone in the world, i do not commit suicide, if there is money, if it is not my own, then i have seen the world at the same age at the age of • • * * * * * * * On these powers Look for ambitions / Seek gifts of luck urdu se hindi ghazal ke jis khubasurat mode par ‘akelaa’ khadey hai sirf yahi baat unke naam ko sadiyon zindaa rakhane ke liye kaafii he, magar inke is basff ke saath ek or jo sifat maujuud he ki wo apane daur ke tamaam halaat ko itane qareeb se dekh rahe hai jaise aaj kaa yug unhen ghur rahaa ho or wo khadey use aankh dikhaa rahe hon
 The 'lonely' Sahib does not bother with Shayari, but rather brings all the truth to the truth which can take the right care of today's society
 kuch udhaaharan dekhen- Where the relationship comes, it is good for him, but he does not earn • * * * * * Go spend some money on the witnesses and become immaculate; But it is true that cats cannot wear bells around the neck • * * * * * * * This way of listening to the problems of the public is infrequent
 Today the bitter truths in lions today Micro frank stated manner
 in izaaphy khusoosiyaat ke alaava bhi virendra khare 'akelaa' kii gazalon main kai or aise pahalu hai jo dil ko tatolte hai, kabhi aankhon ko nam karte hai, kabhi labon par muskaan laate hai, kabhi dimaag ko jhizodate hai to kabhi peeth par thapakiyaan dekar hausala bandhaate hai
 This was a much-talked about ghazal of 'lonely'
 ‘akelaa’ ne sirf gazalen hi nahin kahin balki maujuuda daur kii hindi shaayari kii tamaam vidhaon par taba aazamaai kii he or ek maje hue khilaadi kii tarah apane kalam ke johar sahitya ke har maidan main dikhaae hai
 It seems like 'alaaz' is completely unstoppable on the game of Alphas, Realization, Shaur and with them
 unhone jis vidha ko bhi chuaa use paaya-e-takameel tak pahunchaaya
 The lyrics of 'akela' and Azad Nazz are a strong witness to this fact
 ‘akelaa' ke geeton or azaad nazmon main sachai kaa ek aisa aks dekhne ko miltaa he jo halaat or samaaj par kabhi tikhe or kabhi narm tanz se poor hota he
 This is the reason why every person is compelled to read them and perhaps think that today the songs and poems of 'akela' have become the heartbeat of thousands
 geet or azaad nazm se ek udhaaharan dekhen-bhishma pitamah nity pratigyaayen karte hai bhangdharmraj aksar dikhaai dete adharm ke sangvidura niti ko tyaag sadaa chalate aniti kii chaalkarna mahaadaani hadapaa karte auron kaa maal Our course / includes / a very short lesson on softness / and runs / a whole book / ruthlessness / in udaahranon se spasht he ki ‘akelaa’ ko gazalon kii tarah geeton or azaad nazmon kii zamin par bhi malka hasil he
 The only thing is, as Iqbal has said - "whatever comes out of the heart has an effect
" ” ‘akelaa’ ek sachcha aadmi he wo kuch bhi sochataa, bolta or likhata puri sachai ke saath he or sach baat apana ek asar chhodti he
 Now this truth, whether it is for the poor man to wander from rate to rate to earn a living, whether it is against the hypocrites of politicians or in the form of attempts to change the existing roundabout system
 baharhaal sachai apni roshni chhod kar hi jaati he or isi sachai kii maujuudagi ne ‘akelaa’ kii shaayari ko ek aisi jagamagaahat di he jo logon ko barabas apni ore khinchati he
 What is the truth of the so-called nobility of politicians - "autobiography is high and has to be sown / In such a situation where something has to improve
 prabhu ko he parhez charan-raj dene main / kahiye phir kis tarah ahilya tarani he
 The skit of filling water in the sieve continues / How will these sufferings be restricted? sachai kaa ye bayaan bhi kam nahin he-do dhan do ko chaar siddh karte rah gaye abhaagesat pe nau unahattar jinane baanchaa wo hai agevidya nai, puraani vidyaon se he kuch hat ke The secret of 'lonely' compositions is another and that is that neither his works have got the disease of the stupidity of the poetic forums of today nor the extreme intellectualism of the so-called pure literary group has been able to dominate them
 
 unhone kavita ko uske swaabhaavik rup main prastut karke use durlabh prajati kaa jeev hone se bachaa liya he
 You all know that nowadays Hindi poetry is going through such a plight as if a princess has lost her way in a forest
 ek taraf to manch kii wo shaayari he jise sahitya se kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 Who is trying to fool the public by making lewd jokes and levelless compositions, as the lonely 'lone' has said- "shayari was so much in the eyes of absurdly lewd, Karnapriya rhymes / stage-goers
" ” or duusari taraf shuddh sahitya ke naam par un rachanakaaron kii rachanaayen hai jinhen hal karne main hamaari dictionariyaan hi ochhi pad jaayen yaa jinke shabd to sab samaj main aayen magar arth nikaalane main pasinaa maar jaye
 In such a situation, the way in which the lonely person has kept the poetic words alive, while performing the whole poetic language in the public's tongue, has become his specialty
 or yahi kaaran he ki ‘akelaa’ kii shaayari ko saahitiyik goshtiyon or manchon par ek jaisi maqbooliyat hasil ho rahi he
 Wherever you go 'alone' on the stage, you are simply overwhelmed and prove that good poetry is also heard on stage
 ye alag baat he ki wo manchon par kam dikhaai dete hai
 Actually, forums have their own system - the system of 'give in take' that if a poet has to go to the forums, first he has to put a stage, then the poets whom he will call, in return the poets will call him and the payment will be The same payment will be given to them and they will be called and returned
 itnaa haath ghuma kar kaan pakadaney kii ‘akelaa’ main salaahiyat hi nahin
 The 'azad Nazas' of 'akela' are also very good
 ye or baat ki aajkal logon ne ise shortkat maan liya he or azaad kavita karne waalon kii ek badi bheed jamaa ho gayi he
 Some of them are those who came down on free verse after their failure in writing the poem, and some are those who are fond of being called intellectuals by being poets, then resorted to this mode and let us understand that there are neither rules nor regulation, Is a free style game
 par aisa nahin he
 One can write only the free compositions better than the one who can get Uber on the compositions
 thik usee tarah jaise ek acha driver jo bhare road par kushalta purvak gaadi chalaanaa jaanata ho or traffic ke tamaam niyamon kaa paalan karata ho, agar use kabhi kheton, khalihaanon, pagarhndiyon, pahadiyon par gaadi daudana pad jaye to behatar tareeke se apane driving ke fan ko aazamaate hue is tarah gaadi daudaayegaa ki gaadi kii durdasha na ho, durghatana main haath-pair na tooten or sahi salaamat manzil ko bhi pahunchaa ja sake
 'akela' is familiar with the entire rule of Shayari's traffic
 inke kalam kii gaadi laal, hari, pili batti dekhakar jis tarah chalati he usee tarah jangalon or regazaron main bhi inke haath bahakate nahin
 On this, this lion of Basheer Badr is completely satisfied that- “we are also excellent, we know our skills, whichever way we will walk, the way will be done
 ” When brother Virendra Khare would have kept his 'lonely' alone, then he would not have thought about it
 bhale hi unka ye safar kabhi akele hi shuru hua ho lekin aaj logon ne is ‘akelaa’ ko akelaa nahin rahane diya balki ek bheed uske saath he
 For 'lonely', it would be right to say that - "I had gone alone, the wild mangoers came together and became caravans
 ”meri dua he ki allaah virendra khare ‘akelaa’ ke kalam ko or bhi taqaviyat ata kare or ye kalam ke aise dhani bane ki sadiyon inhen yaad rakhaa jaye
 In the field of 'ana' Qasmihindi Ghazal and song, the name of young poet Virendra Khare 'akela' is very well known
 bundelkhand main duusare dushyant kumaar kahe jane vaale ‘akelaa’ ne apni mul chhavi ke anuroop aam logon ke dukh-dardon ko samarth vaani dene vaali hindi gazalen kah kar dushyant kumaar kii ghazal parampara ko to aage badhaayaa hi he saath hi unhone parmparik hindi geet vidha ko kathy or shilp kii drushti se ek naveen sarvagrahi rup pradaan karne kaa saraahneey kaary bhi kiya he
 This second work of 'akela' will further cement his literary reputation, i believe so

 His view is called moral rationalism
 sucraat kii bhanti usne bhi gyaan ko hi sadgun mana evam darshan ko buddhisangat jivan kaa sarvshereshth pathpradarshak bataaya
 Like many other thinkers of that time, he too seemed to be in a degenerate society of his time and he understood the function of philosophy to make possible the moral upliftment of the society and bring it to the level of true freedom

 The server is often running for some time without interruptions and availability but must be of a high quality that can make the dependability and stability of the hardware extremely important
 Although servers can be made up of useful parts of the computer but mission- Critical servers use specific hardware with a very low failure rate to increase uptime

purchasing
 kaaryaatmak rup se, ise electronic check kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki paise bank khate se yaa to sidhe nikaale ja sakate hai yaa shesh raashi card ke zarie bhi nikaali ja sakati he
 In some cases, the card is designed specifically for the Internet only in such a way that there is no physical card
 debit card kaa upyog kuch deshon main vyapak ho chukaa he or isane check kii jagah le lee he or kuch maamalon main badi maatra main nakadi kaa lenden bhi hota he
 Like credit cards, debit cards are also used for purchases via telephone and Internet, but credit card amounts are transferred from the carrier's bank account rather than being paid by the carrier in a later manner
 debit card kii sahaayta se aap turant nakadi nikaal sakate hai, kyonki yah atm card or check guarantee card kii tarah prayukt hota he
 Where customers can withdraw cash along with purchases, the merchant can offer its customers "cashback" / "cash out" facilities
 "credit yaa debit?" debit card kaa upyog karte samay yah sawaal aksar sanyukt rajya america main suna jaataa he
 In the US, whatever credit or debit you choose at the time of sale, the money always comes from the cardholder's checking account
 vaise bahusankhyak US upabhoktaaon ko in donon main koi fark najar nahin aata he
 Since the money will always come from the cardholder's checking account, there will be a difference between "credit" and "debit" at the time of sale
 jab carddharak "credit" chunata he to lenden kii prakriya "ofline" hoti he
 At the time of sale, a merchant may or may not process the card to obtain a license
 anugna ek aisi guarantee he, jiske jariye vyapaaree ko raashi kaa bhugtan ho jayega
 ek saamaanya credit card lenden main, raashi tab tak carddharak ke khate se nahin nikaali jaati he jab tak ki vyapaaree uske credit card ke sabhi lenden kaa nipat nahin letaa he, iske baad carddharak ke checking khate se kharidari kii raashi ke evaj main bhugtan maanga jaataa he
 The amount of time it takes to send the charged amount to the cardholder's account depends on the merchant
 carddharak jab "debit" kaa chunaav karata he to lenden kii prakriya "online" hoti he
 At the time of sale, the cardholder authenticates the purchase with his "PIN", the amount is checked and when approved, immediately transfers the money from the cardholder's checking account to the merchant's account 
 zyaadaatar US upabhokta credit banaam debit ke prati udasin rahete hai, jabaki inamen mahatvapurn antar hota he or un sabko is bare main pataa hona chahie
 The most important thing is that under any circumstances, the process of transaction in the form of credit can be disputed, whether it is debit card or credit
 The kind of disputes over a debit card can lead to similar disputes over the credit card: the charge remains in the account in the same way until the dispute is resolved in favor of the cardholder
 debit carddharak ke liye iske myne yah he ki tab tak vah rakam se dur rahata he jab tak ki uske paksh main vivaad sulajh nahin jaataa he or use vah rakam phir se adaa kar di jaati

 Sufi Islam briefly includes Imam Hasan al-basri, a Muslim cleric, Sufi
 pracheen muslim saadhakon main hasan al basri sarvaadhik lokapriy hai
 Like Indian sages, he gave more importance to sannyas in his life and less of mysticism like other Sufi saints

 hasan vastav main dhani the or heere-jawaharaat kaa vyavsaay karne vaale johari the
 But leaving him, he chose a difficult life for himself
 unhone chauthe khalipha hazrat ali se sanyas kii diksha lee thi
 He was extremely renunciate and Bhagavatrami
 lekin iske saath vah bahut achche kanoon daan or kavi bhi the
 His voice had a great impact on the people
 attaar ne unke bare main likhaa he ki vah bilkul ekant main rahete the or kisi se bhi unki koi chaah nahin thi
 Nobody had ever seen him laughing
 unke shishyon main sufi bhi the or kattar musalmaan bhi
 He considered the Supreme God to be the best, yet he said that through self-purification he can be found
 unka kahana tha ki sansaarik bandhanon ke mayajaal ko kaatane par hi manushya paramatma ko paane kii aashaa rakh saktaa he
 God who has renounced all desires and turned away from this fleeting world, will receive Himself
 basri kehete the ki paap karm main rat rahane vaale ko paramatma dand detaa he, isliye apane gunahon ke liye pashchaatap karo
 He had made a mistake in his childhood
 use vah bhul na jaaen or phir us karm ko dobaaraa na kar baithen, is baat ko baraabar samaran rakhane ke liye vah jab bhi nayaa vastra dhaaran karte the, to us samay use us vastra par likhakar rakhte or likhane ke samay aisa krandan karte ki behosh ho jate
 Hasan al-basri has said many times that do not spoil that other world by getting trapped in the temptations of this world
 unke mat se budhimaan vahi he jo koi bhi aisa kaam nahin karata jisase us sansar ko paane main baadha ho
 He said that true disinterest is what God is for

 Do not remain in solitude with any woman 3
 On someone's words Do not give ear hasan ne baar-baar duharaaya he ki nashwar jagat kii vastuon ke moh ko tyaago, kyonki bina unase chhutkaaraa paae duusare sansar ko paanaa sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 In fact, in his later Sufi means, the predominance of the mystic tendency is seen, not that of Hassan
 lekin fariduddin attaar ne hasan basri ke ek pravachan kaa uddhran diya he jisamen kaha gaya he- jab swarg main vaas karne vaale pehali baar apni ankhen kholte hai to saat lakh saalon tak bhavavishtavastha main rahete hai, kyonki apni param vibhuti ke saath paramatma apane ko unke saamne prakat karte hai
 In this way, the talk of reaching God, being interviewed, is also found in Hassan's discourses
 hasan basri kehete the ki anasakti kaa ek bindu sahastron saalon kii namaaz or rojaa se shreshth he
 He who has recognized God has established love for them and he who has recognized the world has enmity with God
 manushya kii apeksha bakrii jaisaa jeev bhi saavdhaan rahata he jo charvaahe kaa shabd sunakar charna chhodkar maidan se uski ore daud aati he
 But even after listening to the call of God, man does not go towards them and does not get rid of his enjoyment of happiness
