 While sitting on the throne of Muhammad Tughlaq, the Delhi Sultanate was divided into a total of 23 provinces, the main ones of which were Delhi, Devgiri, Lahore, Multan, Sarmuti, Gujarat, Awadh, Kannauj, Lakhnauti, Bihar, Malwa, Jajnagar, Dvarasamudra etc
 kashmir evam baluchistan bhi dilli sultanate main shaamil the

 parantu isaki krur niti ke kaaran rajya main vidroh armbh ho gaya
 As a result, a new independent state was established in the south and these regions were separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal bhi swatantra ho gaya
 After the ascension, Muhammad Tughlaq tried to make some new plans and implement them
 jaise - Through his first plan, Muhammad Tughlaq increased the tax in the fertile region of Doab, but in the same year there was a severe famine in Doab, which affected the yield
 tululaq ke adhikariyon dwaara jabaran kar vasuulne se us kshetra main vidroh ho gaya, jisase tululaq kii yah yojana asafal rahi

 Muhammad bin Tughlaq provided loans to farmers at very low interest
 tululaq ne apni duusari yojana ke antargat rajdhani ko dilli se devgiri sthaanantarit kiya
 Devagiri was also called "kuvvatul Islam"
 sultan qutubuddin mubarak kilji ne devgiri kaa naam 'qutubabad' rakhaa tha or mohammad bin tululaq ne iskaa naam badalakar daulatabad kar diya
 The Sultan was most criticized for this plan
 mohammad tululaq dwaara rajdhani parivartan ke kaarnon par itihaaskaaron main bada vivaad he, phir bhi nishkarshtah kaha ja saktaa he ki, devgiri kaa dilli sultanate ke madhya sthit hona, mongol akramanakariyon ke bhay se surakshit rahanaa, dakshin-bharat kii sampannataa kii ore khinchaav aadi aise kaaran the, jinke kaaran sultan ne rajdhani parivartit karne kii baat sochi

 sankethik mudra ke antargat sultan ne sambhawatah pital or tamba dhaatuon ke sikke chalaaye, jiskaa mulya chaandi ke rupee taka ke baraabar hota tha
 Due to lack of state control over coinage, many fake mints were made

 His entire army wandered in the wild paths, according to Ibn Battuta, ultimately only ten officers could survive and return
 is prakaar mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi asafal rahi
 Probably between 1328-29 AD, the Mongol invader Tarmasharin Chagtai invaded India with a large army and trampled the territories from Multan, Lahore to Delhi
 aisa mana jaataa he ki, sultan mohammad tululaq ne mongol netaa ko ghoose dekar waapas kar diya tha ye bhi smbhv he ki mongol netaa ne sultan ko dilli sltant ko khud hi ythasthiti kamazor karne va isi tarah mongol shasn ke liye zmin tyaar karne ke liye ghoose di
 Whatever happened between them, the Sultan was subjected to criticism due to this compromise policy towards the Mongol leader
 ye sahi he ki iske baad phir kabhi mohammad tululaq ke samay main bharat par mongol akraman nahin hua or ye bhi ki apni mahattvakankshi asafal yojanaon ke kaaran mohammad tululaq ko ‘asafalataaon kaa badshaah’ kaha jaataa he

 Gravity is the tendency of a material to be attracted towards one another
 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 German astronomer Kepler gave three laws by studying the motion of planets
 kepler kaa pratham niyam: -sabhi grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar kakshaon me chakkar lagate hai tathaa surya un kakshaon ke focus par hota he
 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time
 arthath prayek grah kii kshetreey chaal niyat rahati he
 That is, when the planet is away from the Sun, its speed decreases
 tritiy niyam : - prayek grah kaa surya kaa parikraman kaal kaa varg uski deergh vrittakar kaksha kii ardh-deergh aksh kii tritiy ghaat ke samaanupati hota he
 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground
 par jab akaash main samaan takat chaaron ore se lage, to koi kaise gire? arthath akaash main grah niravlamb rahete hai kyonki vividh grahon kii gurutv shaktiyaan santulan banaae rakhti hai

 For example, Jain thinkers, while acknowledging the independent existence of organisms, defined the organism in these words as "chetnlakshano Jeeva:"
 parantu aatma yaa jeev kii satta sweekaar karanevaale sab vyakti ek mat ke nahin
 They can be broadly divided into two classes

 real and earth Shri Adi has also believed in the existence of soul in movable roots
 at: unhen sarvatmavaadi vichaar kaa samarthak kaha ja saktaa he
 In fact, in trees, planets, subconscious, even unconscious things, people who believe in the power of soul or organism are still found in many countries, such as the cow of the world, which are often not only of spirits, especially of their dead ancestors, but of such souls
 They also worship people whom they do not understand as related to any particular body or object or to the deity of natural substances or arrogant deities

 It includes all the leela-places of Lord Krishna like Mathura, Vrindavan, Govardhan, Gokul, Mahaban, Valdev, Nandgaon, Varsana, Deeg and Kamban etc
 ukt braj kii seemaa ko churaasi kos mana gaya he
 Devoted poets and interlocutors of Surdas and other Vrajbhasha called Braj the ghetto in the adjacent forest area of mathura on the emulation of the Bhagavata Purana, and have given it a different meaning from 'mathura', 'madhupuri' or 'madhuvan'
 braj kshetra main aane vaale pramukh nagar ye hai- mathura, jalesar, bharatpur, agra, hathras, dhaulpur, aligarh, itawa, mainpuri, eta, kasganj, or firozabad
 The word Braj is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'vraj', meaning mobility
 jahaan gaay charati hai or vicharan karti hai vah sthaan bhi braj kaha gaya he
 The author of Amarkosh has given three meanings of Braj - Gotha, Marg and Vrind
 sanskrit ke vraj shabd se hi hindi kaa braj shabd bana he
 In the Vedic codes and the ancient Sanskrit scriptures of Ramayana, Mahabharata etc
, the word Braj is also used in the sense of Goshala, Go-sthan, Gochar Bhumi

 The place of grazing of cows in the Yajurveda is called Braj and Goshala is called Gostha

 In Skandpuran, Maharishi Shandilya uttered the meaning of the word Braj and said it to be the form of a broad Brahman
 atah yah shabd braj kii aadhyatmikta se sambadhit he
 In Vedas to Puranas, Braj has been described as related to cows
 chaahe vah gaayon ko baandhne kaa bada ho, chaahe goshaala ho, chaahe gochar bhoomi ho or chaahe gop-basti ho
 In the Bhagavatakar's view, Gostha, Gokul and Braj are synonyms

 At that time, his foster Nandadi Gop Gana used to roam around Mathura with his gokul in the wide expanses to facilitate his protection and conservation of land
 shrikrishna ke kaaran un gop-gopiyon, gaayon or gochar-bhoomiyon kaa mahatv bad gaya tha
 From the mythological period to the emergence of the Vaishnava cults, as Krishnopasana expanded, so did the glory of the above mentioned traditions of Sri Krishna and his Leela places
 is kaal main yahaan go-paalan kii prachurtaa thi, jiske kaaran vrajakhandon kii bhi prachurtaa ho gai thi
 That is why Mathura, the birthplace of Shri Krishna and the entire region around Mathura connected with his pastimes, was called Braj or Brajmandal
 is prakaar braj shabd kaa kaal-krmanusaar arth vikaas hua he
 During the Vedas and the ramayana-mahabharata, where it was used for small places like 'gostha' - 'go-sthan'
 vahaan puranic kaal main 'gop-basti' jaise kuch bade sthaan ke liye kiya jane laga
 Till that time, the word was regional rather than stately

 It is one of the six Vedangas of Hinduism - its meaning: interpretation, etymological interpretation

 Small formulas have been given in Nirukta to make meaning of words
 iske saath hi isamen kathin evam kam prayukt vaidic shabdon kaa sankalan bhi he
 Traditionally, the ancient grammarian Yask of Sanskrit is considered the father of it
 vaidic shabdon ke duruh arth ko spasht karnaa hi nirukt kaa prayojan he
 In the Rigvedabhasya role, Sayan has said that Arthavabodhe absolutistly Padajatam Yatraoktam Tanniruktam means that where the collection of posts is done freely in terms of information of meaning, it is free

 Knowledge of the inaccessible meaning of Bheda Veda is not possible without the knowledge of Nirukta
 kashikavriti ke anusaar nirukt paanch prakaar kaa hota he— varnagam varnaviparyay, varnadhikaar, naash or dhaatu ke kisi ek arth ko sidb karnaa
 In this treatise Yask has mentioned the views and opinions of Shaktayan, Gargya, Shakpuni Muni's word-etymology and has given his views on it
 vartmaan uplabdh nirukt, nighantu kii vyakhya he or vah yask rachit he
 Yasak's contribution is so great that he is also called Niruktakar or Nirukrita and Niruktavat
 yask ne apane nirukt main purvavarti niruktkaar ke rup main aupmanyav, autumbarayan, vashryamani; gargy, agrayan, shakpuni, aurnanabh, tetiki, gaalav, sthaulashthivi, kaunshtuki or katthakya ke naam uddhrut kiye hai

 Such an esoteric idea on the word scripture is not seen anywhere else in ancient times
 shabdashastra par anek mat prachlit the iskaa pataa yask ke nirukt se lagata he
 Some people were of the opinion that all words are metallic and metals are mere verbs in which different words are formed by adding suffixes etc
 is mat ke virodhiyon kaa kahana tha ki kuch shabd dhaaturup kriyaapadon se banate he par sab nahin, kyonki yadi 'ashan' se ashv mana jaay to pratruek chalane yaa aage badhanevaala padaarth ashv kehalaayegaa
 Yask has denied this opposing view
 yask muni ne iske uttar main kaha he ki jab ek kriya se ek padaarth kaa naam pad jaataa he tab vahi kriya karanevaale or padaarth ko vah naam nahin diya jaataa
 Another opposition of the other side was that if the names are given in this way, then any substance has as many properties as it should have
 yask isapar kehete he ki ek padaarth kisi ek gun yaa karm se ek naam ko dhaaran karata he

 maharishi aurobindo ne bhi vedon ko samajhane main nirukt kii mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa zikr kiya he
 To understand the language of Vedic Sanskrit, grammar is also read and Ashtadhyayi is considered to be its greatest text
 nirukt main shabdon ke mul kaa varnan he, yani kis bhaavana ke kaaran ghode ko ashv kaha jaataa he iskaa varnan he
 Whereas the grammar describes the feeling emanating from the original words of Ashvaruddha
 nirukt main chunki mulon kaa varnan he, atah jin shabdon kaa varnan he vah chote hai, jabaki vyakaran main lambe shabdon or vaakyon kaa bhi varnan he, kyonki vyakaran sandhi-samaas-alankaar aadi kaa vivechan karata he

 1995 ke baad se, chithran kaa kaam chitrakaar or lekhak anupam sinha ne sambhaal liya
 Whatever Nagraj is today, it is because of these Indian comic industry stalwarts Pratap Malik and Anupam Sinha
 nagaraj kaa charitra puranic ichhadhari naag, aitihaasik vishaiylla maanav se prerit mana jaataa he
 Her stories have a rich blend of mythology, fantasy, magic and science fiction
 nagaraj ke kai prashansakon kaa yah maananaa he ki samay ke saath nagaraj comics ne apana hi ek sarp puraana viksit kiya he jo janata ke bich sanpon ke bare main prachlit lokapriy bhartiya manyataon ke liye adwitiya he
 Nagaraja was originally conceived as an enemy of international terrorism
 dilachasp baat yah he ki apane pehle ank main nagaraj ko dusht vaigyanik profesar naagamani dwaara ek antarrashtriya aatankwaadi hathiyaar ke rup main pravartit kiya gaya tha
 Nagaraja was entrusted with the task of stealing the idol of the goddess from a temple protected by tribal devotees, snakes and the mysterious old monk named Gorakhnath Baba, over 300 years old, in this first mission
 nagaraj apane kaary main safal rahaa, lekin gorakhnath or unke rahasyamay kaale nevale shikangi se muqaabale main parrast ho gaya
 Gorakhnath read his mind and discovers that Professor Nagamani has implanted a mind-control device in the form of a capsule in his head to keep Nagaraja under his control 
 gorakhnath ne shalya-chikitsa kii or nagaraj ke sir se capsule ko hataa diya, jisase nagaraj profesar naagamani ke niyantran se mukt ho gaya
 After this Nagraj became a disciple of Baba Gorakhnath and he vowed to eliminate crime and terrorism from the earth
 Since then Nagraj has visited the world thrice and defeated many villains and terrorists
 samprati nagaraj ek kaalpanik shahar mahanagar main apane hi gopneey swaamitv vaale tii
ve
 channel ke karmchaaree raaj ke rup main jivan yaapan kar rahaa he
 In ancient times, when the gods roamed the earth without any restrictions, there existed an empire called Takshaknagar, which was ruled by King Taksharaj and Queen Lalita
 shaasha danpati ko koi chintaa nahin thi sivaay ek ke; unki koi santan nahin thi
 The absence of a prince or princess made the sole Nagpash his potential heir
 Nagpash was the identical younger brother of the emperor, who began to live a grand life without knowing that he was the only possible heir to the throne
 jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya, rani apane bachche ke abhaav main udhaas rahane lagi
 raja ko rani ke avsaad kaa kaaran samaj main aa gaya or ve bhi pareshaan rahane lage
 pati-patni ashish ke liye apane paariwarik devtaa dev kaaljayi kii puja karte the
 Dev Kalajayi also knew the reason for his grief, so one day he blessed him to have great children
 unka aashirwad safal hua or jald hi rani garbhvatee ho gai or puure rajya main kushi kii lahar daud gai sivaay nagapasha ke
 The birth of this child meant losing the throne to him, so he decided to kill the child before it was born
 ek din jab rani dev kaaljayi kii puja ke liye ja rahi thi, to nagapasha ne devtaa ke bhoga kii dhaki hui thali main, prasad ko mare hue nevale se badal diya
 Nagadevata felt angry and made the queen unconscious with her venomous breath
 raja ne devtaa se kshamaa yachana kii or apni patni ko thik karne kii prarthana kii lekin devtaa ne aisa karne se inkaar kar diya, jiske baad hataash raaj ne aatmahatya karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Unable to withstand the death of the devotee, Dev Kalajayi told him a way to save the life of the queen
 He gave the gem to the king and asked him to react with the queen's medicine
 Mani will reverse all the poison from the queen's body towards the child's body, but due to the ill effects of the poison, the queen will lose her fertility
 saare rajya main matam chaa gaya or raja bhi dukhi ho gaye
 Nagpash was very happy that he has survived as the heir alone
 jab baccha paidaa hua to sabko laga ki vah mara hua he kyonki uskaa sara sharir nila tha or usamen jivan ke koi lakshan dikhaai nahin die
 According to the practice of the Hindus, the newborn was thrown into the river
 nagapasha kushi se jhum uthaa or sidhe nashe main dhut dev kaaljayi ke paas gaya or unase yah kehete hue shahi khajaane ko saunpane ke liye kaha ki vah singhaasana kaa ekmaatr uttaradhikari he isliye shahi khajaane par uskaa adhikaar he
 Dev Kalajayi refused and told him that the "real heir" of the throne was alive and that the treasury would be handed over to him when the time came
 Enraged, Nagpash raised his sword against the deity but fell away with the mere stroke of a giant snake's tail
 Nagpash fell on two bowls, one containing a highly poisonous toxin, which destroyed his face and merged into his blood and the other contained nectar, which made him immortal
 donon ke ek saath prabhaav ne nagapasha ko ek amar vishaiylla aadmi bana diya
 At that time Nagpash could not bear the change of his body and fainted
 jab raja ko dev kaaljayi ne in ghatnaon ke bare main soochna di to unhen pataa chalaa ki unka betaa mara nahin he or unhen apane jivan ke prati sambhavit khataron kaa bhi ehsaas hua
 Therefore, he ordered his loyal astrologer Vedacharya, a great scholar of Tilism, to preserve the treasure in a Tilism that only his son could break
 Vedacharya prepared Tilism with the help of Dev Kalajayi to ensure that no one of the king's sons, except Amar Nagpash, would be able to break that tilism
 When Nagpash regained consciousness, he realized that he had lost the treasure
 gusse main aakar usne raja or rani kii hatya kar di
 In a life-less condition, the infant got trapped in bushes flowing in the river
 vahaan par vah lambey samay tak padaa rahaa
 Meanwhile, the serpent god Dev Kalajayi Chirayu appeared in the dreams of the wishful serpent ruler King Maniraj and his wife Manika Rani, who were living in a human view hiding in an island in the Indian Ocean called Ojhal Nagadweep
 unhone shishu kaa sthaan bataaya or unase uskaa ilaaj karne ke liye kaha
 unhone kahe anusaar kiya tathaa shishu ko found nikaala or unhen yah bhi pataa chalaa ki vah dweep ke mahaan sarp mahatma kaldoot se bhi zyaada vishaiylla he, jo yah sanket detaa he ki uske paas bhagwaan kaa divya vish he
 Initially Raj Vaidya was unsure whether he would be able to treat the infant or not, but Dev Kalajayi himself had asked the king for treatment, so he was convinced that his treatment would be successful
 According to the rules, no one was allowed to bring any outsider to the island, so the king decided to keep his presence a secret
 kai saal biit gaye or ilaaj kaa parinaam nazar aane laga, haalanki abhi bhi usamen koi jivan-kriya nahin thi, par shishu kaa rang dhire-dhire hare main badalane laga
 raja ne yah samachar rani ko diya or unhone bachche ko god lene kaa nirnay liya kyonki unki apni koi santan nahin thi
 His decision was overheard by the evil Tantric Visandhara who wanted to become the ruler of the island, but was afraid of the Mahatma tenant
 usne gupt kshetra par hamalaa kiya jahaan shishu ko rakhaa gaya tha or usko saath lekar bhaag gaya, lekin ishwar ke prakope se dar kar us shishu ko na maarane kaa faisalaa liya or use nadi kii unheen jhaadiyon main waapas rakh diya jahaan par vah mila tha
 Her plan failed as the queen soon conceived and gave birth to a daughter, named Viserpi
 vishandhar ko kabhi pataa nahin chalaa ki jis shishu ko usne bhatakane ke liye chhod diya tha use hosh aa gaya, pehle uskaa cheharaa or phir uskaa sharir saamaanya maanvon jaisaa bana or usne ronaa shuru kiya
 a priest from a nearby temple saw him and presented him to Professor Nagamani, who was wandering in the nearby forest in search of snakes
 agyaat kaarnon se purohit ne ek juthi kahani sunai ki shishu ek aisi mahila kaa he jiskaa balaatkaar hua tha or jo sarp devtaa kii bhakthin thi or shishu ko ichhadhari naag banane kaa aashirwad praapt he or unhone naagamani se anurodh kiya ki ve uskaa paalan-poshan kuch is tarah kare ki vah apni maa kaa badla le sake
 Nagmani realized that the priests were lying but took the infant with him
 shishu ke rakt pareekshan se pataa chalaa ki uski shwet rakt koshikaon main koon kii jagah sookshm saanp hai
 The child had extraordinary curative powers and was highly toxic
 usne shishu kaa paalan-poshan kiya jo aage chalakar nagaraj bana
 Nagaraja was presented to the world as a creation of Nagmani Professor
 use vishisht hatyara mashin banaaya ja rahaa tha or uski mul yojana thi nagaraj ko duniya bhar ke khalnaayakon or aatankwaadi guton ke bich sabase adhik boli lagane vaale ko kiraye par dena
 Professor Nagmani used it for his other pilot projects and leasing it for international terrorism
 naagamani ne hameshaa daawa kiya ki nagaraj ko saanp ke vish ke ansh dekar, uskaa koon zehar banaate hue uski shaktiyon ko viksit kiya gaya he
 He claimed that his venom is the result of snake bites of 1000 different species and that his powers developed from treatment with the ashes of the dead willful serpent
 vastav main tathy yah tha ki nagaraj kisi bhi saanp kii prajati se zyaada zaharila tha, kyonki uskaa vish alokik tha
 Based largely on the sizing Hindu myth, Nagaraja was empowered by the subtle snakes in his blood cells and was subjected to venomous breath poisoning and biting, immediate healing powers, and ropes, parachutes or protruding from his wrist
 And according to his imagination, there are innumerable supernatural powers like snakes taking different shapes
 mana jaataa he ki agar vah kisi ko kaate yaa koi use kaate, to uske vish main potashium synide se bhi tikshn, kisi bhi jivit praani ke sharir ko galane kii shakti maujuud he
 For his first mission, he was sold for a million and the aim was to acquire an ancient statue
 nagaraj safal hota he, lekin phir sadhu "baba gorakhnath" use naakaam karte hai, jo uske man ko "profesar naagamani" ke niyantran se mukt karte hai
 Waking up in a new world of peace of Gorakhnath, Nagaraj vows to eliminate terrorism from the world and moves towards achieving his goal
 praarambhik ankon main nagaraj kii shaktiyaan bhi simit thim, kabhi-kabhi shaktishaalee maanav virodhiyon se bhi vah haar jaataa tha or asthai rup se behosh ho jaataa tha, uski taaqat bhi kaaphi had tak maanvon jaisi thi jaise vah kisi car uthaane vaale ko dekhakar apane virdohi kii shakti se achambhit ho jaataa tha
 Years later, Nagraj became so powerful that he not only held the falling cars alone but also threw things into outer space with ease
 yah ullekhneey he or shaayad vidambnaapurna bhi ki nagaraj ko ab ek puranic-jaadui praani ke rup main badal diya gaya he jise apane dushman ke rup main vilakshan jeevon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, jisamen jaadu-tona or samay or antariksh yatra ke tatv bhi jude hai
 Many see this as the reason for the continued, overwhelming popularity of Nagraj Comics
 haalanki, shuddhivaadiyon kaa ab bhi daawa he ki ve or adhik yathartwaadee or adhik vyaavhaarik kahaniyon ko pasand karte hai jinase nagaraj kii shuruuaat hui thi
 Nagraj is arguably the most powerful superhero of the royal world and the most powerful wishful serpent of his time
 Again and again, he has shown the ability to challenge Sheshnag, Vasukdev, the great serpent deities and defeated serpents like Kaladoot, Triphaana, Mahavayal and Sheetnag Kumar, who are counted among the most powerful serpents of their species
 apane praarambhik ankon main nagaraj ek ghumkkad tha, jo ek himaskhalan kii bhaanti maanav jati ke dushmano ke liye tabaahi machaa detaa tha
 Since there was no need for a disguised personality, Nagaraj did not have one, but he hid himself in an overcoat and often with a hat to hide his identity
 apni asli pahchaan chhipaane ke liye jis poshaak kaa vah istemaal karata tha, uske prashansakon dwaara use hi chhadam bhes kaa naam diya gaya kyonki aksar kisi ko pataa nahin chalata tha ki uske samaksh khadey rahane vaale vyakti swayan nagaraj he
 Nagraj has adopted the same pseudo-personality in his latest global terrorism series
 apaat sthiti main pahachaane jane kaa bhay na hone ke kaaran kai baar nagaraj saarvajanik taur par apni topi or overkot fouran utaar detaa he
 Her previous pseudo-personality was Raj, a clumsy liaison officer in the fictional company Bharti Communications presented in the story
 vah apane raaj kii gupt pahchaan main, sanpon se darane kaa dikhaava karata he
 He wears glasses and a typical business suit and is a very timid and simple man
 yah superman / clark kent ke charitra se bahut hi miltaa-julata kirdaar he, jisaki veshbhusha, bal suljhaana or khud ko chhipaane ke liye chashmon kaa istemaal bhi usee ke samaan he
 Although the initial pseudo personality was based on Fatam, this pseudo personality is based on Superman
 haal hi main "nagaraj ke baad" shrinkhalaa main apni asli pahchaan ujagar karne ke liye majaboor hone ke kaaran, nagaraj ko paristhitiyon kii vajah se apane chhadam vyaktitv ko dubaara badalanaa padaa
 ab maujuuda kathanak ke anusaar vah nai suraksha agency "sneke aaez" ke prabandhak ke rup main kaam karata he
 His new name is Nagraj Singh
 It is owned by Ms
 Saudangi who lives in her body and is a willful serpent

 There was never a chance to show on screen
 The reason is very clear, due to the poor quality of the special effects, Raj himself was not satisfied with the quality of the episodes of the comics serial

 Other less significant laws are the mathematical consequences of the above conservation laws for derivative physical quantities: Chemical laws are those laws of nature relevant to chemistry
 The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary chemical reaction
 Modern physics shows that it is actually energy that is conserved, and that energy and mass are related; a concept which becomes important in nuclear chemistry
 Conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics
 Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass
 Joseph Proust's law of definite composition says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important
 Dalton's law of multiple proportions says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers ; although in many systems the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction
 More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and transformations
 Thermodynamics Quantum mechanics It is thought that the successful integration of Einstein's field equations with the uncertainty principle and Schrödinger equation, something no one has achieved so far with a testable theory, will lead to a theory of quantum gravity, the most basic physical law sought after today

 have devoted their whole life to the study and research of ancient Sanskrit literature of India

 Mostly Christian missionary class and 3

 The people of the first class saw Indian literature in a fair and scientific way through linguistics and considered philosophical ideas inspiring
 This class mainly included August Schlegel, Friedrich Schelgal, Franz Baap, Rudolk Roth Hermann Brorvos Theodor Benfe etc

 But non-british writers made various meanings either from the Christian missionary spirit or from the lack of Vedadi chivalric knowledge or because of the ambivalence of relating Sanskrit to European languages
 ye sabhi britain kii tarah pakshpaati nahin the
 But it is obvious that all Western scholars were well aware that Vedas are the basic foundation of Indian religion, philosophy and culture, and their proper interpretation can be based on nirukta and panini grammar

 The ancient Indian tradition recognizes this style as authentic
 europe main solahavin sadi tak sanskrit sahitya ke prati koi ruchi na thi
 In the middle of the seventeenth century a German Jesuit priest named Henrith Roth came to Agra and first learned Sanskrit for missionary work and in 1662 wrote a book on Sanskrit grammar

 When William Jones was appointed as the Chief Judge of the British Settlement in 1763, he learned Sanskrit and translated Abhigyanasakuntalam of Mahakavi Kalidasa in 1789 and Manusmriti in 1794 into English

 Till then, there was no system of Sanskrit education in England
 sabase pehle england main, 1811 main oxford univarsity main sanskrit bhashaa kii shiksha ke liye vyavastha kii gai
 a bitter Christian came forward for this
 vah tha karnal joseph boden jo ki east india company kii sena main bombay main leftinent-karnal rahaa tha
 This, after retiring, bequeathed all his wealth, which at the time was about twenty-five thousand pounds, to the establishment of a post of Sanskrit-professor at the University of Oxford; And the university also named it 'boden Chair of Sanskrit in gratitude
 boden chair kaa uddeshy, bharat ke gurukulon kii tarah, keval saahitiyik drushti se sanskrit bhashaa kaa padhanaa-padhaanaa nahin tha, balki britain ke rajaitik or isai mishnariyon ke dharmik hiton kii purti ke liye tha
 Colonel Boden's will, which was registered in the Court of Canterbury, UK on 15 August 1811, has its main excerpts and objectives as follows: arthath main apni samast oxford vishvavidhyalay ko daan detaa hoon
 They should use it in a university or a college, where they think it appropriate so that the people of its country can have a proper knowledge of Sanskrit language, which can help in understanding the scriptures of the indigenous people of India and their conversion to Christianity
 is prakaar 1811 main, oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit chair kii sthapana ho to gai thi lekin us samay iske liye koi manachaaha vyakti na mil sakaa
 The first person to be honored on the Boden Chair was H
H
 Was Wilson
 vah bharat main medical profeshan ke ek sadsy ke rup main, 1808 main aayaa tathaa 1832 tak yahan rahaa
 During this period of his residence in India, he learned the Sanskrit language, with the hope and purpose that perhaps this language knowledge could help him to understand the Hindu scriptures and to distort when needed and convert Indians to Christianity
 is sanskrit gyaan ke aadhaar par hi vilson ko, 1832 main, oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit kii boden chair kaa pratham adhishthata banaaya gaya
 Here he first wrote a book for the missionaries called The Religion and Philosophical System of the Hindus
 is pustake ke likhane ke uddeshy ke vishay main usne kahah That is, this article has been written to help those who are candidates for the prize of two hundred pounds established by Mu and who can best refute the Hindu scriptures
 1860 main, pro vilson ke nidhan ke baad, boden chair kaa doosraa adhishthata maunier williams hua
 Born in 1819 in Bombay, Mounier was a cutter Christian
 yah hindu dharm ko nasht karne ko or bhi adhik vachanabaddh tha jaisaaki usne apni pustak 'e sanskrit-english dictionari' kii bhoomika main likhaah "in explanation i must draw attention to the fact that i am only the second occupant of the Boden Chair, and that its founder, Col
 Boden, stated most explicitly in his will that the special object of his munificent bequest was to promote the translation of the Scripture in Sanskrit so as to enable his countrymen to procet'd in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion
 " "it was on this account that, when my distinguished predecessor and teacher, Professor H
 H
 Wilson, was a candidate for the Chair in 1832, his lexicographical labours were put forward as his principal claim to election
" "surely it" need not be thought surprising, if following in the footsteps of my venerated master, i have made it the chief aim of my professional life to provide facilities for the translation of the Sacred Scriptures in Sanskrit and for the promotion of a better knowledge of the religions and customs of india, as the best key to a knowledge of the religious needs of our great eastern dependency
 My very first public lecture delivered after my election in 1860 was on "the Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India"
 arthath main, is tathy kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karnaa chaahoonga ki main to keval boden-chair kaa doosraa adhishthata hoon or uske sansthaapak karnal boden ne apni vasiyat main sabase adhik spashtataa ke saath likhaa he ki uski vasiyat kaa vishesh uddeshy sanskrit dharamshastron kaa anuwaad karnaa he taaki uske desh vaasi bharat ke mul nivaasiyon kaa isaiyat main dharmantarit karne ke yogya ho saken
 This is the reason when my teacher and well-known former officer Prof
 H
H
 Wilson, who was a candidate for this chair in 1832, was presented as the main contender for the post due to his writing work
 nishchay hi ise ascharyajanak na samajha jaae ki yadi mere shraddhey guruuji ke charan chinhon par chalate hue maine apane vyavsaayik jivan kaa mukhay uddeshy bharatiyon ke dharm granthon kaa angreji main bhashya karne ke liye suvidha pradaan karnaa he tathaa bharat ke dharmon or ritirivaajon kii acchhee jaankaree ko badhaava dena he
 In 1860, after being elected to the Boden Chair, in his book The Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India, he stated clearly like a missionary: arthath jab hindu dharm ke majboot kilon kii deevaaron ko gheraa jayega, un par surange bichaai jaaengi or ant main isamsih ke sainikon dwaara un par dhaava bolaa jayega to isaiyat kii vijay antim or puri tarah hogi It is clear from these above that both the scholars of the Boden Chair misused their official position of Oxford University in the name of Sanskrit education for the interests of Christianity
 unhone praachyavidyaon ke shodh kii aad main apane mishanri uddeshyon kii purti ke liye lagaataar prayaas kiya
 Max Müller also worked tirelessly since 1847 to serve the purpose of the Boden Chair; Also contested to get a distorted commentary and Boden chair of the Rigveda
 magar angrej monier williams ke paksh main 883 voton ke viruddh, 610 vot paane ke kaaran vah haar gaya kyonki vah ek gaiyr-british tha
 In this context, the Encyclopaedia Britannica states: maxmooler ke jivan kii yah ek bahut badi niraashaa thi jiskaa uske upar bahut samay tak prabhaav rahaa
 But still he kept trying to popularize the Hindu scriptures and the conversion of Indian religious leaders to Christianity

 According to research published in the respected journal Nature, this civilization is at least 8000 years old
 yah hadappa sabhyataa or 'sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa' ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he
 It developed along the banks of the Indus and Ghaghghar / Hakra
 mohenjodaro, kalibanga, lothal, dholavira, rakhigadhi or hadappa iske pramukh kendra the
 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government

 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization
 pratham baar nagaron ke udai ke kaaran ise pratham nagarikaran bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization

 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state

 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh

 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai

 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros

 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area

 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze

 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing

 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together

 In mathematics, the immediate function, also called instantaneous relation, instantaneous representation, or instantaneous transformation, is a function that produces the specified value as it is used in logic
 sameekaran ke rup main yah falan f = x ke rup main diya jaataa he
 If m is a set, the simultaneous function f on m is defined such that the function and covariance satisfy the following equation with M
 anya shabdon main, falan m ke prayek avyav x se nirdisht avyav m main x he
 Hence the immediate function f on m is usually written by idm
 samucchy siddhanth ke pado main, jahaan falan ek vishesh prakaar ke buliy sambandh se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he or tatsamak falan tatsamak sambandh yaa m ke vikarn dwaara diya jaataa he
 If f: m → n is a function, we get fo idm = f = idn of
 In particular, idm is the immediate component of the monologue of all m to m functions
 chunki ekabh kaa tatsamak avyav adwitiya hota he, atah m par tatsamak falan ke rup main is tatsamak avyav ko paribhaashit kar saktaa he
 This type of definition gives a broader definition of the concept of concordance in cadre theory, where the interplay of m is not necessarily a function
