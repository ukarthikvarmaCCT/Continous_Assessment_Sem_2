hoguarts se shikshit garmaleith satrahavin shatabdi ke purvarddh main ireland main rahati thi
 Around 1608 AD she killed her sister and her husband William Sawyer and kidnapped her five-year-old daughter Islott Sawyer and raised her in the valleys of "hags Glen"
 uskaa maananaa tha ki uske mata -pita kii magaluon se nikatataa isolt ke liye sahi nahin he
 The ferocious and fanatical Garmlath used black magic to isolate Islott from the Magaloo, not allowing him to use a stick, not even entering Hogwarts, as he himself did
 12 saal uske saath rahane ke baad islot ne garmaleith kii chadi chura lee tathaa vah america upnivesh ke ore bhaag gayi or masachusets main rahane lagi
 There he enrolled in the Illwarmorni Witchcraft and Tantra Mantra School

 According to the first chapter of the seventh edition of the novel, he did not even have hair and lips
 duusare va chhathen sanskaran main ateet main smriti paatr dwaara uski dekhi kahaniyon ke anusaar vah fiki twachaa, jet jaise kaale baalo va gahari bhuri aankhon ke saath sundar va lambaa tha
 He could attract everyone with his look
 aisa anumaan he ki uske manushya rup se daitya banane kaa kaaran apni amar hone kii chahat main aatma ko vibhajit karke horcrax bananaa tha
 Voldemort's eyes in the film are blue and the pupil rounded
 rolling ne voldemort kaa "saikadon varshon kaa dushtatam jaadugar" ke rup main varnan kiya he
 He described her as "highly psychotic, lacking the human response to other people's suffering"
 saath hi use apni kushi ke kaaran dusron, visheshkar magaluon, ke katl karne vaala dikhaaya he
 There was a lack of consciousness in him, he did not regret his actions but he did not even understand the importance of his extra humanity
 use na to manushya ke saath saahchary yaa mitrataa sthapit karnaa pasand nahin tha or na hi use kisi se pyaar yaa lagaav tha
 He considered himself superior and considered everyone inferior in front of him
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah " vastav main avishwasaneey dhang se takat kaa bhookha, naslvaadi" tha
 If he looked in the mirror mirror, he would see himself as "omnipotent and indestructible" as he wanted
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah vah apni maan va jaaduugarani meropi gont dwaara ek magalu va uske pita tom riddle par prem kaadhe ke falswaroop utpann hua tha, jo ek asafal pyaar kaa parinaam tha
 His mother dies due to the effects of decoction and the father leaving his mother, but if his mother had lived and loved him, everything would have changed
 vah aakarshan jiske kaaran tom riddle ke rup main janme balak kaa voldemort main parivartan hua vah bahut aavashyak he kyonki yahi vah sankalpana dikhaata he jiske kaaran is paatr kaa janm hua
 Like almost all the villains, Voldemort's eagerness causes his downfall
 vah mrityu se atyadhik bhay tha, jise usne sharmnaak tathaa ghrunit insaani kamajori bataayi he
 He had many signs of being egoistic
 apane praan bhakshiyon ke saamne voldemort ne yah mana he ki usne harry ke mata-pita par hamale kii badi keemat chukaai he, or phir usne yah avlokan kiya ki isamen kya galat hua or ant main vah ye dosha swayan par letaa he
 Rolling has written that his polymorphism would have been his last journey
 rolling ne voldemort or harry main antar bataate hue kaha he ki harry ne mrityu ko sweekaar kar liya tha is kaaran se vah ant main uski tulana main adhik taqatvar hokar ubhara
 Rolling throughout the series describes Voldemort as a highly powerful, intelligent and ruthless evil sorcerer
 vah dusro kaa dimag achche se pard saktaa tha or swayan ke dimag main ghusane se dusro ko roak bhi saktaa tha
 Apart from Dumbledore, he was the only known magician who used to be silent
 voldemort ek maatr jaadugar dambldor se darataa tha
 In the last book, Voldemort was shown flying without any support, anyone who read or saw this was taken aback
 apane purvaj gonton kii tarah vah bhi sarpon se sarpbhasha main baat kar saktaa tha
 He got this skill from his ancestor Salazar Slytherin
 gont parivaar swayan kii baatcheet main bhi is bhashaa kaa prayog karte the
 This extraordinary trait may have been genetically ingested in it, as this tradition was followed in the Gaunt family to maintain purity of blood
 jab voldemort navjaat harry kii hatya kaa prayaas karata he tab uski aatma ke hisse ke saath sarpbhasha main bolne kii kala harry main bhi chali jaati he
 When he dies in Harry, part of the soul, this power dissipates in Harry
 chathe bhaag main puraani kahani dekhne ke dauraan voldemort ne dambaldor ke saamne ek naukari ke saakshaatkaar ke dauraan daawa kiya ki usne "jaadu kii simaayen pehle se adhik badha di hai"
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort's magical knowledge is far greater than any living sorcerer, and that even with Voldemort's return to full power, Dumbledore's knowledge of having the most powerful defense spells in front of his spells would be insufficient
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort sambhavtah hoguarts kaa sabase budhimaan vidhyaarthee he
 But despite Voldemort's unique talent and skill, he was unfit to withstand such powerful magic as love; No powers worked at this time
 puure shrunkhlaa main uski yah sabase badi jaadui ayogyata dikhaai gayi he
 Voldemort initially begins to doubt his magical powers, but after regaining his body and strength he confesses to his life-worshipers that he had ignored the power of Lily Potter's love that saved Harry's life
 
 rolling ne apni website par khulaasa kiya he kii voldemort kii chadi ek sadahrith vriksh se bani thi jiskaa ras jaharila tha jo kii mrityu kaa pratik tha
 It was thoughtfully designed with an axis similar to Harry's wand, made of an evergreen pruned bush
 ise unhone isliye chunaa tha kyonki sadabahaar kaatedaar jhaadi shatru se badla lenaa kaa pratik maani jaati he
 Rolling establishes in the book that Voldemort was magically associated with him through a scar made on Harry's forehead
 jab usne harry ko mrityu shraap diya or uskaa ulta asar usee par ho gaya, tab yah nishaan harry ke maathe par ban gaya tha
 In the book and films it is shown that Harry's mark was indicative of Voldemort's presence
 yah tab adhik dard karata tha jab anishtdev uske nikat hota tha yaa vah nirdayee yaa bahut khush hone vaala bhav darshata tha
 According to Rolling, at the time of the attack on the newborn Harry, Voldemort gave Harry a magical window of his mind as a forehead mark that no other magician does
 bahut se log voldemort ke paatr kaa kuch raajnneetigyon se tulana karne lage
 Rolling posited that Voldemort was "a type" of Adolf Hitler

 The general meaning of ideology is in political theory a set of ideas prevalent in a society or group on the basis of which it justifies or inappropriate a particular social, economic and political organization
 vichaardhaara ke aalochak bahudhaa ise ek aise vishwaas ke vishay ke rup main vyavahrut karte hai jiskaa koi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin hota
 It is argued that the followers of a particular ideology follow him by believing it to be true in itself, its verification is not considered necessary
 vastutah prayek vichaardhaara ke samarthak uski pushti ke liye kinchit siddhant or tark avashya prastut karte hai or duusare ke man main uske prati aasthaa or vishwaas paidaa karne kaa praytn karte hai
 In communism, ideology is considered a part of the superstructure, where it reflects economic relations
 samyavaadee chintanadhara kii manyata he ki adhiktar vichaar, visheshkar samaaj ke sanghathan se sambandhit vichaar, varg vichaar hote hai
 They are actually the views of the class that dominated society at that time
 in vichaaron ko vah varg baaki samaaj par thope rakhata he kyonki yah varg prachaar ke saare sadhano kaa swami hota he
 Ideological conflict in a society with opposing classes is analogous to a conflict of class interests, because ideology can also be a true or false reflection of reality and can also be scientific or unscientific
 pratikriyaavaadi virgon ke hit juthi vichaardhaara ko poshit karte hai
 The interests of the progressive, revolutionary classes are instrumental in building a scientific consensus
 samyavaadee manyatanusaar vichaardhaara kaa vikaas antatogatva arthvyavastha se nirdhaarit hota he, parantu saath hi usamen kuch saapeksh swatantraaa bhi hoti he
 Its manifestation is particularly in the impossibility of directly explaining economic content of ideology, as well as some inequality of economic and ideological development
 in sabake alaava vichaardhaara kii saapeksh swatantraaa kii adhiktar abhivyakti vichaardhaaratmak vikaas ke aantarik niyamon kii sankriya main or saath hi un vichaardhaaratmak kshetron main hoti he, jo aarthik aadhaar se bahut dur sthit hote hai
 The reason for the relative independence of ideology is that ideological development is under the influence of various non-economic factors
 ye kaarak hai : vichaardhaara ke vikaas main aantarik anukramik sambandh, vichaardhaara vishesh ke nirupakon kii nijee bhoomika tathaa vichaardhaara ke vibhinn roopon kaa parsparik prabhaav, aadi
 In the sixth and seventh decade of the twentieth century, mismatches of a scientific view of reality and ideology of reality became widely prevalent among bourgeois philosophers
 burjua vichaardhaara ko atmik pratyay kii bhanti maanate hai jo keval samooh yaa dal vishesh ke hiton ko vyakt karti he
 That is why they are willing to make differences between science and ideology, to keep them in competition
 burjua darshan or vigyaan kaa tathakthith "nirvichaardharakaran" karne kaa praytn karte hai
 In the eighth decade, bourgeois ideologues began to talk of "rethinking" in the realization of their cause, presenting their new ideology against communism

 In the field of polymer science, Flory's earliest work was in the field of polarization kinetics at the dupont Experimental Station
 sankshepan polirogeshan main unhone chalange kiya ki,jaise mochromolicul badi rup main badhati jaayegi vaise hi jet main kami hoti jaayegi, is dharna ko chunauti di he, or jet kaa aakaar ko swatantra diya
 He argues that the number of current chains is rapidly decreasing and the size increases

 In 1938, after Carothers' death, Flory moved to the Basic Science Research Laboratory at the University of Cincinnati
 vahaan unhone do se adhik kaary samoohon ke saath yogicon ke polirogeshan or bahulak network / gel ke siddhant ke liye ek ganitiya siddhant viksit kiya he
 In 1940, he stated that he would develop a statistical mechanical theory for polymer blending, where Standard Oil Development Company's Scuba, New Jersey lab would join

 He was invited to the Tau chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma at Cornell; In 1949 he elaborated and published in 1953 by Cornell University Press, which made his famous composition, Principles of Polymer Chemistry, in his Baker Lecture refined Cornell
 yah jaldi se polimur ke kshetra main sabhi shramikon ke liye ek maanak paath ban gaya tha, or abhi bhi vyapak rup se is din ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 In 1934, he introduced his concept for Flori Polymer by Werner Kuhn
 apvarjit maatra ki ek lambii shrikhla anu kaa ek hissaa pahile se hi ek hi anu ke dusre hisse ke kabje main he to us sthaan par koi bhi anu kabja nahin kar saktaa, is vichaar ko unhone darshata he
 Except for the excluded volume, the polymer causes the ends of a chain in a solution to be comparable to the volume placed there, only then it can become part of it
 ek maatra ko bahar rakhaa gaya he,manyata ke samaadhaan ke liye ek mahatvapurn vaicharik safalataa pradaan ki lambii shrikhla ke anuon kaa vishleshan karne main ek mahatvapurn kaarak tha,or din ke puzzling prayogtmak parinaamon ki vyakhya karne ke liye netritv kiya
 It also leads to the theta point that, under the leadership of the concept, the effect of the mere excluded in which an experiment can be carried out on which the set of conditions has been neutralized

 Flory correctly identified that the chain dimensions in the polymer melts would be the calculated size for a chain in the ideal solution if the volume interactions were neutralized using theta point

 Hazrat Umar ibn al-khatab, E
 Muhammad Saheb's chief was among the four Sahaba
 vah hazarat abu bakr ke baad musalamaanon ke duusare khalipha chune gayi
 Muhammad was named as Farooq
 jiskaa arth satya or asaty main fark karne vaala
 His status among the followers of Muhammad sahab comes after Hazrat Abu Bakr
 umr khulpha-e-raashidin main duusare calipha chune gaye
 Omar proved to be the most successful caliph in the khulafa-e-rashidin
 musalmaan inako faruk-e-aazam tathaa amirul muminin bhi kehete hai
 European writers have written many books about him and given the title of Omar Mahan
 prasiddh lekhak maaikel ech
 heart ne apni prasiddh pustak di handred The 100: a Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, main hazarat umr ko shaamil kiya he
 Hazrat Umar was born in Mecca
 ye kurash khandaan se the
 i had learned to read writing in the days of ignorance, which in those days, the Arabs considered reading writing to be a useless task
 inkaa qad bahut ooncha, raubadaar cheharaa or gathila sharir tha
 Umar was one of the famous wrestlers of Mecca, who had a great influence in Mecca
 umr salanaa pahalwani ke muqablon main hissaa lete the
 Initially, Hazrat Umar was a staunch enemy of Islam
 or mohammad sahab ko jaan se maarna chaahate the
 Omar initially used to do fetishism
 umr makka main ek samrudgh parivaar se the, bahut bahadur tathaa diler vyakit the
 Omar did not like Muslims, nor did Muhammad's mission
 parantu paigambar muhammd sahab ek shaam kaabe ke paas jaakar allaah se dua kiya ki allaah umr ko yaa amr abu jahal donon main se jo tujko priy ho hidaayat de
 This prayer was accepted in favor of Omar
 umr ek baar paigambar ke katl ke iraade se nikle the, raste main naeem naam kaa ek shaks mila jisane umr ko bataaya ki unki bahan tathaa unke pati islam laa chuke hai
 Omar got angry and went to the sister's house
 vah donon ghar par kuran pard rahe the
 Umar started asking for the Quran but he refused
 umr krodhit hokar un donon ko maarane lage
 But his sister said we will die but will not leave Islam
 bahan ke chehre se khun tapakataa dekhakar umr ko shame aayi tathaa galati kaa ahsaas hua
 Said that i want to read the Quran, promised not to humiliate it
 jab umr ne kuran padhaa do bole yaqinan ye ishwar kii vaani he kisi manushya kii rachana nahin ho sakati
 In a miracle, Omar accepted the truth of the Quran and went to meet Muhammad
 mohammad sahab ko bahut prasannataa hui jab umr islam main daakhil ho gayi
 Muslims ran a wave of happiness over Omar's bringing Islam
 umr ne elaan kiya ki ab sab milke namaaz kaabe main padhenge jo ki pehle koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 Omar was an enemy of Islam but now he became the protector of Islam
 umr ko islam main dekhakar mohammad sahab ke shatruvon main koharaam much gaya
 Now Islam had got a sharp sword named Umar which made all Mecca tremble
 makka waalon ne kamazor musalamaanon par sitam tej kar diye jisko dekhakar mohammad sahab ne allaah se dua kii to allaah ne madeene jane kaa hukum diya
 All the Muslims started hiding in Hijrat i
e
 towards Madinah
 magar umr bade diler the apni talwaar lee dhanush baan liya, kaaba ke paas pahunch kar tawaaf kiya, do rachaat namaaz padhi phir kaha "jo apni maan ko apane par rulaanaa chahta he, apane bacchon ko anaath tathaa apni patni ko vidhwaa bananaa chahta he is jagah mili
 "nobody dared to stop Omar
 umr ne elaan karke hizrat kii
 Medina had become a new center of Islam
 san hijri islaami calendar kaa nirmaan kiya jo islam kaa panchang kehalaata he
 In 624 AD, Muslims had to fight the battle of Badr, in which Hazrat Umar also played an important role
 badr kii jang main musalamaanon kii fatah hui tathaa makka ke musharikon kii haar hui
 a year after the battle of Badr, the Meccans came together to attack Madina, the battle took place near a hill called Uhud
 jang ke shuru main muslim sena baari padi lekin kuch kaarnon vash muslimon kii haar hui
 Some people sparked the rumor that many Muslims were frightened if Muhammad Sahib was martyred, Omar also threw a sword and started saying that it is useless to live now
 kuch derbar pataa chalaa kii ye ek afvaah he to dubaara khadey hue
 After this, they lived together in Khandak's war
 umr ne muslim sena kaa netratv kiya ant main makka bhi fatah ho gaya
 Even after this, many battles had to be faced, Omar led an eye in all those wars
 8 june san 632 ko mohammad sahab duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Omar and some people did not believe that Muhammad could also have death
 ye khabar sunakar umr apane hosh kho baithe, apni talwaar nikaal lee tathaa jor-jor se kehane lage ki jisane kaha ki nabi kii maut ho gai he main uskaa sar tan se juda kar duungaa
 On this delicate occasion, then Hazrat Abu Bakr gave a Khutba meaning speech to Muslims which is very famous: phir koran kii aayat pard kar sunai: Hearing from Hazrat Abu Bakr, all the people fell on their knees, Umar also fell on his knees and accepted this great sorrow
 jab hazarat abu bakr ko laga ki unka vaqt nazadik he to unhone agle khalipha ke liye hazarat umr ko chunaa
 Omar was well known for his extraordinary will power, intelligence, political, impartiality, justice and care for the poor and underprivileged
 hazarat abu bakr ko puri tarah se umr kii shakti or unako safal hone kii kshamta ke bare main pataa tha
 The succession of Omar was thus not as troublesome as any of the others
 hazarat abu bakr ne apni mrityu ke pehle hi hazarat usmaan ko apni vasiyat likhavai ki umr unke uttaradhikari honge
 Hazrat Abu Bakr died in August 634 AD
 umr ab calipha ho gayi tathaa ek naye daur kii shruwaat hui

 At the time of the birth of the child, the mother has an important role in the environment around her
 bachche kaa pehla sambandh maan se armbh hota he
 Smith says that nature has strengthened this relationship, so society, religion and literature have sanctified the affection of mother and child
 is lekh main, samajashastriyon kii maanav samaaj main premamulak sambandhon kii do avadharanaon kii charchaa ke baad, sneh kii vaikalpik soch ke sandabh main, larenz ke hans, batakh aadi pakshiyon ke chuzon, tathaa harlo ke bandar ke bacchon, par adhyayanon kaa sankshipt varnan dekar, balbi ke sneh siddhanth ko rakhaa gaya he
 And finally, in other areas of Sneh Siddhanta, a growing scope is looked at
 bachche or maan kaa rishta samaaj kii niv he, yah vichaar america ke harry harlo tathaa england ke jon balbi ne 1958 main, alag-alag shodh patron main prastut kiya
 Earlier, there were two conceptions about the basis of group among sociologists
 pehali seekhney ke siddhanth se judi he, or iskaa sambandh vyavahaarwadiyon kii manyata se he ki navjaat bachche ko doodh chahie, jo maan detii he, isliye baccha maan ke nikat rahata he
 Psychoanalists add to this the tendency of sex or sex, which has many dimensions, John Balby mentions them in detail in his research paper
 in donon avadharanaon ke bare main koi thos saboot na hone ke kaaran harlo or balbi ne inhen nakaar diya, or iskaa vikalp dhundne lage
 And both focus on the behavior of animals in natural environments, called ethnology
 ek ithologist larenz ne kuch pakshiyon hans, batakh aadi par adhyayanon main dekha tha ki chuza apni maan ke peeche saath-saath chale isi main uski suraksha he, tathaa use khaanaa dhundne or tairne kaa anubhav bhi hoga
 In goose or duck chickens, according to Larenz, three types of stimulants from the environment are necessary for early learning in this way, a kind of voice north of the chick's voice; Some object is moving away from the chick; That object should be removed from time to time
 aksar yah vastu chuze kii maan hogi, kyonki chuze ke andey se baahar nikalate samay vahi paas main hoti he
 Instead of a mother, if there is a man, then the chick will go after him, but all three qualities should be there
 adhyankan kaa matlab navjaat shishu ke man par maan yaa dekh-bhaal karne vaale kii akruti kii chhap padane se he
 Larenz made this discovery in 1935
 jab ek baar chuze main yah thappa yaa imprint pad jaataa he, isamen parivartan aasaani se nahin hota
 That is, if a goose hatches in the goose chick immediately after getting out of the egg, then it will go after the goose for a lifetime
 yadi chuze main pehali chhavi aadmi kii bani to vah aadmi ke peeche chalegaa, hans ke peeche nahin
 Whether the man is a thin girl or an old man, there will be no difference
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat, larenz ke liye thi, hans ke chuze ko paalane vaali maan yadi duusari prajati kii thi, kuch saalon baad jab yah chuza vyask hua, to prajnan ke liye usee prajati ke pakshi ko chunaa jo paalane vaali maan kii prajati kaa tha, hans nahin
 The same results were later seen in sheep, which are described below
 larenz ne likhaa he ki, yadhyapi adhyankan seekhney ke antargat aata he, kintu isamen adhigam yaa seekhney kii tarah pralobhan kii zaroorat nahin he
 It is a process in animals which helps in making the child in close relationship with the mother in the natural state and has a far-reaching effect
 larenz kii adhyankan kii khoj tathaa itholaji kaa asar jon balbi kii soch par bhi padaa
 With this, an important thing that helped to strengthen the foundations of the principle of affection was the exchange of ideas between Harlow and Balby
 isamen madhyam the ithologist rabart hind, jo us samay england main bandaron main maan or bachche ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan kar rahe the
 Harlow and Bowlby were impressed that the newborn's spontaneous behavior links him to his mother
 harlo ne ise bandar ke bachche par prayongo se siddh kiya tathaa balbi ne manushya ke bacchon par jaankaree ikatthi kii or ise vaicharik rup diya
 Harlow attacked the pragmatists and psychoanalysts, saying that although it is true that the mother fulfills the baby's need for milk, it can be related to it, but such relations can be formed with anything and they break up quickly
 isliye un sahaj vyavhaaron kaa adhyayan hona chahie jo maan ko sneh ke rishton main baandhte hai
 He further wrote, because such experiments cannot be done on a human's newborn baby, so he chose the monkey's children
 tab tak harlo prayogshaala main bandar ke bacchon ko 6 se 12 ghante ke bheetar maan se alag kar, unako paalane main safal ho chuke the
 In the new experiments, Harlow found substantial similarities between the monkey's children, such as the newborn's clinging to the soft object and spending more time with it, about the two spontaneous behaviors observed by Balby in human children
 itnaa hi nahin, harlo ne paaya ki lagbhag 300 din kii umr ke bandar ke bachche naram kapade se lipati maan kaa paryaay yaa cloth mother surrogate ko nihaarne main bhi zyada samay dene lage
 The experiments that took place over the next several years are summarized by Margaret Harlow and Harry Harlow in a 1966 research paper
 is shodh patr main unhone likhaa ki kaam yaa sex kii sahaj pravriti maanav or bandar main samooh ko baandhne kaa aadhaar kho chuki he
 He further writes that the discovery at the University of Wisconsin at the social development of the monkey revealed five affective systems or affectional systems, which form the basis of social relationships among these monkeys
 yah paanch premamulak tantra hai—baccha-maan sneh tantra; baccha-baccha sneh tantra; visham lingi sneh tantra; maatrutiv sneh tantra; tathaa pitrutv sneh tantra
 Finally, he wrote that these five affection mechanisms must have been important in the development of the male-apes group or primates
 inase samooh ke sadasyon main mail-jol banaae rakhane main madad mili hogi, jisase samooh main sahyog panpa, bahari takaton se jujhane kii kshamta badi, or bachche ko seekhney kaa vaataavaran mila
 Even more about the far-reaching consequences of affection came from experiments on monkeys that Harry Harlow and his comrades saw for several years in detail, separating the monkey's children from their mothers, which Harlow and Meyers described as a In the book, and in humans, Balby introduced the separation from mother and the annihilation of mother in children in the section 2 and section 3 of affection theory, which is introduced in the next part
 Has been taken
 balbi ne likhaa he ki sneh siddhanth par kaary 1956 main shuru hua or anek shodhpatron main isse judy vaigyanik samasyaon par 1953 se 1963 tak vivechna kii gayi, lekin sneh siddhanth kaa mukhya praaroop sneh or vilop yaa Attachment and Loss teen khandon main—1969 main khand-1; 1973 main khand-2; tathaa, 1978 main khand-3, chapa
 Highlighting the history of the main ideas and related discoveries printed in these three volumes, Balby and his colleague Ainsworth wrote that both of them were working on the contribution of parents in the development of children's personality even before entering the educational profession
 , Especially those children who are left alone, who do not get the love of the mother
 vah aage likhte hai, ki balbi kaa pehla adhyayan jo 44 yuva choron par tha, pataa chalaa ki in bacchon main adhiktar aise the jinhen sneh nahin mila
 Balby then produced a report for the World Health Organization, which linked maternity's contribution to the child's mental health, and its main purpose was to develop affection for the child's upbringing
 balbi ke teen khandon main sneh siddhanth kii jo mukhya baaten hai, vah ensworth or balbi ke anusaar yah hai
 The first and second part of section 1 describes in detail the study of the ideas and instinctive behavior of evolution associated with the principle of affection
 iske atirikt sneh kii shaareerik aavashyaktaaon se jude siddhanth ko nakaar kar, uski jagah aise vyavhaar tantra tathaa sanchaalan tantra jinka koi vishesh uddeshy ho, jaise larenz kaa adhyankan or harlo ke premamulak tantra
 Apart from these, Balbi has written that in humans, the development of the child as well as the image of the mother and other people associated with affection and its innate behavior give rise to internal working patterns, which have special place in affection theory
 khand-1 ke paanchave bhaag ke aarambh main sneh ke vikaas kii chaar avasthaaen bataai gai hai
 Phase-1, in this early stage, the newborn treats people in a particular way: turning to the person, chasing with the eyes, holding, reaching, laughing, etc
 avasthaa-2, uparokt vyavhaaron kaa or zyada prayog, parantu maan kii taraf vishesh dhyaan dena
 Phase-3, the child begins to recognize people, sees the mother exclusively, and behaves differently from new people
 avasthaa-4, sneh kii vastu yaa maan se najdiki sambandh, or usase jude vyavhaaron main sudhaar karnaa
 Section 2 of Balbi gives special attention to the child's innate behaviors that arise due to isolation from objects of affection, and also the conditions in which affection mechanisms are implemented
 balbi ke anusaar yah bacchon ke alag-alag vyaktitv ke vikaas kaa aadhaar he, jaise kuch bachche darpok hoge, yaa kuch main sneh se judi chintaa zyaada hogi
 In addition to this, strong foundation of affection has also been emphasized in the normal development of the child
 balbi ke khand-3 ke shuru main sangyaan kii un prakriyaaon kaa varnan he jo soochnaaon ke achetan rup se sangyojan main sahaayak hai
 They have been given special importance in the development of internal working formats
 is khand main mukhya dhyaan vyask vyakti main shok par he
 a person will go through four stages - the numbness; The craving and anger of the object of affection; Clutter and despair; And, the effort and sadness of recombination
 sneh siddhanth ke jantuon main badhate aadhaar ko dekhakar, ellison joli likhti he, udvikas kii prakriya main bachche or maan ke bich ek shashakt, prachur or vyaktigat sambandh kaa chayan hota he, jiskaa naam shaayad pyaar he
 Although Harlow confined these romantic relationships to the child and mother of the monkey, and Balby to the child in man and the person who cared for him, he, Jolly says, described affection as the basis of social life
 lekh ke is bhaag main, harlo or balbi ke vichaaron ke badhate aadhaar kaa andaaza, stanadhariyon main chuuhe se lekar bandar, or manushyon main bhakt or uske aradhya dev ke rishte, par hone vaale adhyayanon se lag jaayegaa
 According to Kendall, the mother is the most important part of the child's environment in humans, and indeed in all mammals
 vah aage likhte hai ki dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay parivaar ke tuutane se bacchon kaa maan-baap se rishton kaa abhaav, unke vikaas ke liye durbhagyapurna tha
 Kendall writes, Harlow's efforts on monkey children gave the idea a scientific basis, but Balby's main contribution to it was
 do mahatvapurn baaten jinaki ore candal ne dhyaan dilaayaa he
 One, parents are emotionally attached to their child's behavior, in which the main thing is prevention of incidents that make the child happy and sad
 do, manushya or jantuon main pehle 2-3 saal tak baccha nihit smriti tantra par nirbhar rahata he jo achetan hota he, umr badhane ke saath usamen jo parivartan hote hai vah chetan yaa spasht smriti tantra banaate hai
 Both of these, according to Kendall, are important for the mechanisms of affection in humans and animals
 candal ne bataaya ki chuuhe main jab bachche ko maan se alag kiya jaataa he, to unamem aise vyavhaar dekhe gaye jaise aadmi ke bachche main maan se alag karne par dekhe gaye, mukhyatah pehle virodh, or phir udaasi kii avasthaa
 Its effect was seen in the hypothalamic – pituitary – adrenal system
 yah parivartan aisi rasinic prakriyaaon ko janm dete hai jo bachche ke chetan yaa spasht smriti tantra main baadha daalati he
 That is, this memory system either does not develop, does not know or does not control properly, whenever there is a stress situation
 bhed or bakriyaan, prakritik or paaltu donon avasthaaon, main samooh yaa revad main rahati hai
 It is considered necessary for both the lamb and the group to have attachment to the group
 smith ne is lagaav yaa sambandh ke vikaas kaa bhed main adhyayan ke dauraan dekha ki memna janm ke thode samay baad khadaa hokar apane sir ko aisi vastu ke neeche daalata he jo uske kandhon ke baraabar he
 Usually it is the space between the front or back legs of the sheep, in addition to that the sheep also sniff and lick the lamb, and rub it with the head and mouth
 smith ne in vyavhaaron kaa varnan karte hue likhaa he ki is sampark se ek ore maan apane bachche kii chhavi apane mastishk main banati he, duusari ore memna kaa maan se sambandh banataa he
 If this relationship between a lamb and a sheep or a goat is not formed at the beginning, then the sheep or goat will reject the lamb and the lamb does not move with the group
 is sambandh kaa doorgaami asar bhi dekha gaya
 Sheep and goats usually live in a ravd, when they are adults, the sheep will choose the sheep for breeding and the goat is the companion of its species
 kendrick or unke saathiyon ne dekha ki, yadi paidaa hone ke baad se bhed ke bachche ko bakrii paale, tathaa bakrii ke bachche ko bhed paale, to vyask hone par, bhed jo bakrii ke saath pali he prajnan ke liye bakrii chunegi, tathaa bakrii jise bhed ne paala he prajnan ke liye bhed chunegi
 Additionally, Kendrick also observed that the sheep could remember the faces of other sheep, up to about 50, long enough
 ellison joli ke anusaar nar-vanar samooh main sneh sambandhon kii nimna mukhya visheshtaayen hai
 The first feature of the male-apes group is that the child is physically and emotionally connected to the mother, and this relationship becomes more complex from the lemur to the human
 maan se bachche ke is sambandh kaa jivan ke aarambhik kaal main saamaajik vyavhaar ke prashikshan main vishesh mahatva he
 Secondly, according to Jolly, the mother will not be able to live properly until she sees the child in particular, or her social behavior will be lacking
 jaise, yah zaruri he ki, maan apane bachche ko apni godi main bithaae, use stanpan karne de, uski safai kare, or use sehalaye or uski madad kare
 The child's spontaneous behavior, such as clinging, crawling, inertia, and sucking, reinforces this relationship
 inke saath-saath kai kism kii awaajen maan or bachche ko ek duusare kii taraf aakarshith karti hai
 Thirdly, Jolly says that John Bowlby emphatically put the doctrine of Larenz's study in the context of human development
 yahi nahin, balbi ne bachche ko asahaay avasthaa se baahar nikalakar udvikas ke sandarbh main dekhne kii pahal kii
 That is, the child has chosen such practices that keep him in touch with the mother, identify him, be afraid of strangers, and go to the mother as soon as danger occurs
 chauthe, joli kaa maananaa he ki yah zaruri nahin ki nar-vanar samooh main baccha maan ke abhaav main mar jaae, bachche kaa vyavhaar samooh ke anya sadasyon main maatrutiv kii bhaavana jagaane main sakasham he
 Jolly says that if there is a lapse in social behavior at one level, there are many possibilities to make up for it
 bachche ke sangi-saathi or anya vyask nar va maadaa isamen sahaayta karte hai
 Finally, Jolly believes that many such phenomena occur in the natural state that are difficult to quantify in the laboratory
 yah ghatnaayen bachche ko shashakt karti hai, jaise, bachche ke bade hone par, stanpan chhudaana, god se dur rakhana, ped se kudane main madad, khatre kaa ahsaas, aadi
 Balby has outlined some points at the end of section 1
 sabase pehle, sneh kii pravriti or sneh vyavhaaron main antar spasht kiya
 Secondly, he said that affection of a child is half of the bond of affection
 maan kaa bachche se vyavhaar, or phir pita va anya sadasyon kaa isamen yogadan, ise purna karata he
 Thirdly, many patterns or patterns of affection are found in the personality of children, it will be very important to understand them to contribute to mental health
 balbi ke anusaar sneh siddhanth ke teenon khand, vastu se sneh sambandh bananaa, sneh vastu se algaav, tathaa sneh vastu kaa vilop, sanyukt rup se sneh ko samajhane ke liye zaruri hai
 According to Tancrede and Frelle, studies done on the theory of affection, affection has been seen in them as a whole, whether it is between a child and a mother, an adult male and female love, or a devotee and his or her deity
 tencrede or frele ne sneh siddhanth kii chaar mukhya visheshtayen yaa kasautiyaan bataayi, sneh kii vastu se najdiki yaa proximity maintenance, sneh kii vastu se algaav kaa virodh or virah vednaa yaa separation distress, sneh kii vastu ek surakshit aadhaar yaa secure base, tathaa sneh kii vastu ek surakshit swarg yaa safe haven
 But it is natural for the search to focus on one aspect related to them, such as the internal working model
 sneh siddhanth ke bare main kuch logon kaa vichaar he ki jahaan jon balbi ne sneh ko nayi soch dekar vaigyanik str par laa khadaa kiya, vahin ensworth ne iske vichaaron kii pushti ke liye pramaan ekatra kiye
 Ainsworth and his colleagues gathered data about mother and child from two methods — home inspection and a unique situation
 pehali vidhi main ghar jaakar maan or bachche ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan, tathaa duusari vidhi main bachche ko maan se alag kar ek kamare main rakhana or ek ajnavi mahila se mulaakaat, or phir bachche kaa maan se punarmilan ke samay vyavhaar dekhnaa
 This test revealed three categories of children
 surakshit yaa secure bachche maan se punarmilan ke samay khush rahete, shant ho jate or khilne lagate
 Other children are divided into two categories, an unsafe parivar or insecure-avoidant, who turns away from the mother at the time of reunion, with no joy, and no interest in sports, and the other insecure / ambivalent or insecure –resistant / ambivalent, who at the time of reunion would contact Mother when she was angry, no happiness, and no interest in sports

 bartholomev ne balbi ke sneh siddhanth kaa vayaskon main adhyayan kiya or vyaktitv main sneh ke chaar praaroop khoje—surakshit yaa secure, chintit yaa preoccupied, khaariji yaa dismissing, or darpok yaa fearful
 Although these four patterns of personalities have been studied in many directions, Steele says that a new direction is the father's contribution to the child's development
 khoj kartaaon ne sneh bandhan kii uparokt chaar mukhya kasautiyon, najdiki rakhana, virah vednaa, surakshit aadhaar, tathaa surakshit swarg, ko bhakt kaa uske aradhya dev se sambandh samajhane ke liye roopantaran kiya
 His concept, which Kirkpatrick first elaborated on, is that affection for God can be regarded as bondage
 bhakt kaa bhagwaan se sambandh anek roopon main milegaa, balak, premi, sakha, aashray dene vaala, aadi
 Cicirelli put these four criteria in this way, forging a close relationship with God, suffering the separation from God, God a safe base, and God a safe heaven
 sicireli aage likhte hai ki kirkapetric kaa maananaa he ki bhagwaan se sambandh do tarah se ban saktaa he, ek to vah log jinka maan se vishwasaneey sambandh he, isko sidhe bhagwaan par sthanantarit kar sakate hai, duusare vah log jinka maan se vishwasaneey sambandh nahin he, isaki poorti ke liye bhagwaan se naata jodenge
 Grenquist and his colleagues think that when the affection system is stimulated by events in the external or internal environment, a person will seek or feel closer to God
 vaigyanik lekhan se abhipraay 'vigyaan ke liye likhnaa' he
 Science writing means writing about science, medicine, technology for general public to read

 Human mind and outer world are similar and relative to each other
 jo kuch or jaisi bahari jagat main ghatnaayen hoti hai, unheen ke samaan or anuroop manushya ke maansik jagat main ghatnaayen ghatit hoti hai
 Sometimes external world events become the cause of mental world events
 maansik jagat main sadaa sangharsh hote rahete hai
 Just as in the external physical world, there is a struggle for self-defense and self-propagation in the organism, similarly there is a struggle in the mental world of man in his different kinds of thoughts
 jo vichaar adhik prabal hota he or jiskaa aantarik pravriti se adhik samanvay sthapit ho jaataa he, vahiin vichaar jivit rahata he
 This idea gives rise to many ideas according to that, due to which a special kind of character, nature or personality is created
 maansik sangharsh ek badi hi dukhadaayi man: sthiti he
 This struggle takes place in two strong thoughts or feelings of man
 jab tak yah sangharsh chalata he, manushya bada hi baichaiyn rahata he
 Mental struggle may be painful, but it is absolutely necessary for the development of human personality
 do prabal bhaawanaaon ke sangharsh ko shant tathaa samaapt karne ke liye aise siddhant kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo sangharsh karne vaale vichaaron athwa bhaawanaaon main samanvay sthapit kar sake, athwa jo ek vichaar ko padasth kar de or duusare ko chetana se hataa de
 The man of developed personality is the one whose strong, certain fundamental principles have developed in life, which fits all the new ideas and new feelings on the basis of these principles and only the person who meets them gives place in his personality, Conducts according to him and removes the mold
 is prakaar kii kriyapranali se kartavya shaastra or darshan kaa aavirbhaav hota he

 In them, mental development is not possible in human beings
 maansik sangharsh kii charchaa pracheen kaal se hoti chali ai he
 We find a picture of such a struggle in the Bhagavad Gita
 mahabharat ke samay kaurav or pandavon ke bich jo bhautik sangharsh ho rahaa tha, usase kahin adhik mahatv kaa sangharsh vah tha, jo, arjuna ke mastishk main chal rahaa tha
 The result of the first conflict was of importance only to the country and period in which the Mahabharata war took place
 duusare sangharsh kaa parinaam aaj bhi apana mahatv rakhata he
 He became a pioneer for the people of this country and era
 is sangharsh ke parinamswaroop ek naye darshan kaa janm hua, jiskaa mahatv saare sansar ke liye he
 The above conflict has been discussed by scholars from all the countries of the world and they have tried to tell with their own vision how to end such conflict
 aadhunik manovigyaan ne ek nae prakaar ke sangharsh kii ore dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 This struggle is something that we cannot even know
 pehle prakaar kaa sangharsh un vichaaro athwa bhaawanaaon ke bich hota he jinka hamen gyaan he athwa jinhen ham gyaat kar sakate hai, atev aise sangharsh kaa ham ant bhi kar sakate hai
 If we cannot end this struggle on our own, then by taking help of other knowledgeable person or people, we can overcome it
 aise vyakti ko ham guru, rishi athwa darshanik maanate hai

 Ending the conflict of the unknown mind is a more difficult task than ending the conflict of the known mind
 ham un do virdohi pakshon main samanvay sthapit kaise kar sakate hai jinhen ham jaan hi nahin pate? phir guru kii bhi yahan upyogita kya ho sakati he? jab koi vyakti yah jane ki uske man main sangharsh he, tabhi to guru ke paas jayega or usase prakaash paane kaa praytn karegaa
 How many people, who have strong unknown conflicts going on in their mind, often do not know that there is a situation of conflict in their mind
 aise anek log is agyaat, athwa achetan man ke, sangharsh kii upasthiti ko hi nikamma siddhant maanate hai
 What is the evidence of this unknown mind's struggle? How did the scholars of the world know that there is also a struggle of the unconscious mind? In the modern period, this struggle was first invented by Dr
 Freud
 usee ne is siddhant kaa pravartan kiya ki manushya ke man ke do bhaag hai-- ek chetan or doosraa achetan
 In this, the conscious mind of man is much smaller than the unconscious mind
 chetan man sampurna man kaa aathvaan bhaag he
 Everything else is unconscious
 hamen chetan man kii ghatnaon kaa hi gyaan hota he; achetan man kii ghatnaon kaa gyaan saadhaarant: nahin rahata
 All the desires, emotions and thoughts are present in our unconscious mind, which we remove from our consciousness and make a strong effort to suppress their memory
 ye icchaayen, bhav athwa vichaar anek prakaar ke hote hai
 They compete among themselves in the same way that they do in their consciousness, but we do not know about their struggles
 jis prakaar hamaari chetana ke samaksh na keval vibhinn visham swabhaav kii ichchhaaon, bhaavon or vichaaron main aapasi sangharsh hota he, sabhi kaa sangharsh hamaare jivan ke pramukh siddhant se hota he, usee prakaar achetan man kii in shaktiyon main bhi na keval apsi sangharsh hota he, varan sabhi kaa sangharsh manushya ke us naitik swatv se bhi hota he, jo manushya kii chetana ke neeche, arthath uske anjaane hi, is sangharsh ko chetana ke str par aane se roke rahata he
 This moral title is similar to that of the intelligence department of the government, which inadvertently keeps the miscreants of many types of evils in the kingdom unknowingly of the king
 jis prakaar rajya ke chor or daaku sarkaar ke khufia vibhaag se darate hai or uski aankh bachaakar hi samaaj main vicharan karte hai usee prakaar manushya ke anek aniatik, damit bhav uske naitik swatv kii najar bachaakar chetana ke str par aate hai

 in pratikon ke dwaara damit vaasana prakashit hoti he
 Repressed lust is manifested by everyday mistakes and unreasonable fears and worries
 isi ke kaaran manushya ko anek prakaar kii jhak or illtein lag jaati hai
 Frequent washing of hands, nostrils, head scratching, buttoning, placing hands on chest, moving an organ continuously - all are symbols of repressed emotion
 in pratikon ke dwaara damit bhav prakashit hota he or manushya samya sthiti kii ore jaataa he
 Many types of physical and mental diseases are also the result of mental conflict
 ye bhi damit bhaavon ke baahar nikalne ke ytn parinaam hai
 Mental illness itself shows that mental conflict is present in the mind of a person
 maansik rog ke dwaara damit bhav kii shakti ksheen ksheen hoti he
 Many mental diseases like hysteria, neurasthenia, melancholia, etc
 bring out repressed emotions

 As civilization progresses, mental illnesses increase

 Any type of mental struggle ends with this
 parantu yadi damit bhaavon ke chetana ke str par aane ke baad bhi yah sangharsh chalata rahe, to uskaa ant karne ke liye chikitsak ko rogi ke prati uchit drushtikon bhi apnaanaa padataa he
 In this way it is also necessary to be a philosopher and teacher

 He is re-educated
 saadhaarant: maansik rogi kaa naitik swatv bada hi kathor hota he
 To make him humble, the doctor has to do many kinds of efforts
 rogi ke prati bahut hi prem kaa bhav dikhaane se man ke vibhinn bhaagon main itani ekta aa jaati he ki damit bhav chetana ke str par aa jaaen
 For this, the attitude of the doctor is very generous
 jab tak prem or sevabhaav kii pradhanta chikitsak main nahin hoti, tab tak use agyaat maansik sangharsh ko samaapt karne ke liye na keval maansik chikitsa ke gyaan kii aavashyaktaa he, varan ek tarah kii darshanik samaj or sujh kii bhi aavashyaktaa he
 In addition, the doctor should have the firmness of emotion, so that he can awaken the truth and generous feelings in the mind of the patient

 Aamir Khan plays a negative character in the film, who cleverly steals

 Dhoom 3 is the first film to be screened in IMAX format in India
 yash raaj films kii banaaie hui is film ne gharelu box offis par 280 karod rupe kii kamai kii thi
 The film starts in 1990 where Iqbal Aaron Khan runs a circus named Great Indian Circus in Chicago
 sarkas bahut hi kharaab vittiya halaat se guzar rahaa hai jis kaaran iqbaal par bahut karz hai
 The Western Bank of Chicago from which Iqbal has borrowed, sends his representatives to close the circus due to non-payment of loans
 iqbaal unase vinati karata hai ki meraa sho dekho agar aapako pasand aae to karz chukaane ke liye kuch or mohalat de dena
 The representative would order the circus to be closed even after watching his show
 iqbaal kaa chota sa betaa sahir bhi unase vinati karata hai par wo nahin maanate
 Iqbal commits suicide in front of everyone by saying "bankers are like you", which causes his little son to panic
 kai saalon baad sahir ab bhi wo ghatana nahin bhuulaa hai or wo bank waalo se badla lene kii thaanta hai
 He steals several branches of Western Bank of Chicago and runs away using his circus acrobatics by writing "bank Valo Tumhari Aisi Ki Tasi" in Hindi
 kyonki chicago police use nahin pakad paa rahi hai or unhen hindi bhi nahin aati isliye wo bhartiya police main se asipi jai dikshit or uske sahyogi ali ko madad ke liye bulaate hai
 In order to get Jai Sahir knowingly, he spreads the matter that he is handling this case and he feels that the thieves are definitely an amateur
 isse sahir chori karne kii thaanta hai, wo ek samachar channel se is yojana ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karata hai or jai ke liye mumbir banane kaa naatak karata hai
 In this way they gather information about the bank and give Jai a clue to go back
 antat: sahir bank main chori kar letaa hai or motorcical pe bhaagane lagata hai, jai usko goli martha hai par sahir bhaag jane main safal ho jaataa hai
 Sahir premieres the revamped version of the Great Indian Circus, along with his female colleague Aaliya, which includes a trick with him to vanish from one place and appear at another
 sho safal hota hai, lekin baad main jai, ali or police use chaaron ore se gher leti hai, jaanate hue ki wo chor hai
 Jai says that the evidence is the bullet wound, but when Sahir is examined, there is no bullet mark anywhere on his body
 jai or ali sarkas se chale jate hai jabaki sahir apane kamare main chalaa jaataa hai
 Here it is revealed that Sahir has a twin brother, Samar, who helps him in his circus tricks and bank robbery and it was Samar who was shot

 Now we will listen to it
 bharatvarsh ke saurashtra desh main dwapar yug kii yah kahani hui he
 At that time there was a king named Bhadrashrava in Saurashtra
 ve bade parakramee raja the
 He had knowledge of four Vedas, six scriptures, eighteen Puranas
 unki rani kaa naam suratchandrika tha
 The queen was beautiful and well-behaved in appearance and was virtuous
 un dono ko saat putr tathaa uske baad ek kanya kaa vardaan mila tha
 The girl's name was Shambala
 ek baar mahalakshmi ji ke man main aayaa kii jaakar us raja ke rajprasad main rahe
 With this the king will get double wealth and he will be able to give more happiness to his subjects with this wealth
 garib ke ghar agar rahe or use dhan-daulat praapt ho to vah swaarthee kii tarah keval apane upar hi kharch karegaa
 Thinking of this, Shri Mahalakshmi took the form of an old Brahmin woman, with a stick in her hand, reached the queen's gate with a stick
 yadhyapi unhone budhi aurat kaa rup dhaaran kiya tha par unke chahare par devi kaa tej tha
 On seeing them, a maid came to her, she asked her name, dham, work, religion
 vruddh brahman kaa rup dhaarit mata lakshmi ne kaha, "balike meraa naam kamala he mere pati kaa naam bhuwanesh he
 We live in Dwarika Your queen was the wife of a Vaishya in a previous life
 vah vaisya garib tha
 Due to impunity, there used to be quarrels in the house everyday and her husband used to kill her every day
 in baton se tang aa kar vah ghar chhodkar chali gayi tathaa ban jangal main khaali pet bhatakane lagi
 i felt pity for his plight
 tab maine use sukh sampati dene vaali shri mahalakshmi kii katha sunai
 At my behest, he observed Sri Mahalakshmi fast
 shri mahalakshmi prasann hui uski garibi dur hui
 His house - the world was filled with wealth, children, wealth
 baad main pati patni donon paralok sidhaare
 Due to fasting of Lakshmi, he stayed in Lakshmi lok
 unhone jitne saal mahalakshmi kaa vrath kiya utane hajaaron saal unhen sukhbhog mila
 In this birth, she was born in the royal family, but she forgot to observe the fast of Shri Mahalakshmi
 use yah yaad dilaane main yahan ai hoon
 "on hearing the old lady's handmaid, she greeted him, and asked how Mahalakshmi should be fasted
 In the form of old age, Shri Mahalakshmi Mata told the maid the method and glory of worship
 iske baad vah daasi mata ko pranaam kar rani ko bataane andar chali gai
 The queen was very proud of her opulence while living in royalty
 sampatti tathaa adhikaar kii vajah se vah unmatta ho gai thi
 Hearing the old woman's talk about the maid, she was furious and came to the gateway and lashed out at the old lady Mr
 Mahalakshmi
 use yah maaloom nahin tha kii shri mahalakshmi mata budhiya kaa rup dhaaran kiye dwaar tak ain he
 But seeing such a rude behavior and disrespect of the queen, Mother did not think it right to stay there
 ve vahaan se chal paddy
 On the way, he found Princess Shambala
 He told Shambala all the things
 Shambala apologized to Shri Mahalakshmi Mata
 mata ko us par dayaa ai
 He told Shambala about Shri Mahalakshmi fast
 us din aghan maah kaa pehla guuruuvaar tha
 Shambala observed Sri Mahalakshmi fast with reverence
 fal swaroop raja siddheshwar ke suputr maladhar se uskaa vivaah hua
 She became rich with wealth, opulence, splendor
 pati ke saath sasuraal main anand se din bitaane lagi
 Here, Shri Mahalakshmi raged on the queen
 falswaroop raja bhadrashrava kaa rajya evam rajakrobar nasht ho gaya
 Even there was a lot to eat
 aisi halaat main ek din rani ne raja se nivedan kiya " hamaara damaad itnaa bada raja he, dhanwaan he, aishwaryashaalee he, kyon na uske paas jaye, apana haal use bataaye, vah jarur hamaari madad karegaa
 "at this point, King Bhadrasrava left for son-in-law
 rajya main pahunchakar ek talab ke kinare thodi der vishram lene ke liai tehre
 Tens saw them coming to fetch water from the pond
 unhone vinamrata se unki poochtacha kii jab unhen yah maaloom hua kii ve rani shambala ke pita he to daudte huai ja kar unhone rani ko sari baat bataai
 The queen sent the maid to the maid and welcomed him with great dignity
 khan paan karavaaya
 When they started returning they made a pot full of gold pieces
 raja bhadrashrava jab waapas laute to unhen dekhakar rani suratchandrika khush hui
 He opened the mouth of a pitcher full of gold pieces, but oh god! All the coal was found in the pitcher in exchange for money, due to the wrath of Shri Mahalakshmi, thus many days passed
 is baar rani swayan apni kanya ke paas gai
 That day was the last Thursday of Aghan month
 shambala ne shri mahalakshmi kaa vrath kiya, puja kii, apni mata se bhi vrath karavaaya
 After this the queen came to her house
 shri mahalakshmi kaa vrath rakhane par use phir se apana rajpth, dhan-daulat, aishwarya praapt hua
 She started living a life of happiness, peace and happiness again

 On his return home, he took some salt from the father's house
 aapane ghar lautne par uske pati ne puch, "apane maayke se kya laai ho?" is par usne jawaab diya, " vahaan kaa saar laai hoon

 " us din shambala ne sara bhojan namak daale bina banaaya or parosa
 The husband tasted food

 Then Shambala poured salt in the plate, this made all the food look delicious
 tab shambala ne pati se kaha, "yahi he vah maayke se laayaa hua saar
 "the husband got it right

 lokkathaayen ve kahaniyaan hai jo manushya kii katha pravriti ke saath chalakar vibhinn parivartanon evam parivardhanon ke saath vartmaan rup main praapt hoti hai
 The most important thing is that there are evidences of several versions of folklore cast in certain plot stereotypes and genres, with its continual development with new tendencies and characteristics
 ek hi katha vibhinn sandarbhon or anchalon main badalakar anek rup grahan karti hai
 Like folklore, we also have folklore as a traditional will of man
 daadi athwa nani ke paas baithkar bachapan main jo kahaniyaan suni jaati he, chaoupaalon main inkaa nirmaan kab, kahan kaise or kiske dwaara hua, yah bataanaa asambhav he
 "although grandparents narrate more stories than grandma's grandmother, but giving more importance to grandma is also the result of inherited practice!" - Dr
 Ravindra Bhartiya kathaon kii pracheenta ko dhundte hue ant main anveshak rugveda ke un sookhton tak pahunchakar ruk gaye hai jinamein cathopakathan ke madhyam se "samvaad-sookt" kahe gaye hai
 His tradition is also present in Brahmin texts
 yahi kram upanishdon main bhi miltaa he kintu in sabase purv koi katha kahani thi hi nahin, aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The question arises, where are the practices that originated in all of them? Folklore should also be considered the same starting place where they originated
 panchatantr kii bahut si kathaayen lok-kathaon ke rup main janajivan main prachlit hai
 But it is also true that the stories that are found in folk life are not found in Panchatantra either
 yadi yah kaha jaae ki vishnu sharma ne lokajeevan main prachlit kathaon se laabh uthaaya hoga to koi, anupyukt baat nahin hogi
 The original folk life of Hitopadesh, Brihadashlok collection, Brihatkatha Manjari, Katha Betal Panchvinsati etc
 jataka kathaon ko atyadhik pracheen mana jaataa he
 Their number is around 550 but there is no fixed number of folklore
 praakrit bhashaa main bhi anek kathagranth hai
 The "bahukaha" story written in the original Paisachi became the staple of Saritsagar, Brihatkatha etc
 sanskrit main uski kuch kathaayen roopantarit hui
 "pum Charia" and "bhavishyat Kaha" of Apabhramsa also come in this order
 is tarah likhit rup main vaidic samvaad sookhton se pravaahit kathadhara nirantar pravaahit he kintu in sabakaa yoga bhi lokajeevan main prachlit kahaniyon kii barabari tak nahin pahunch saktaa
 Some of their characteristics are revealed by the study of Hindi folklore
 manushya adikaal se sukhon kii khoj main laga hua he
 Pleasures are both temporal and otherworldly
 bhartiya parampara main parloukik ko loukik se adhik unchaa sthaan diya jaataa he "ant bhala to sab bhala" ke anusaar hamaari lokkathaayen bhi sukhaant hua karti he
 There is hardly any story that is sorrowful
 chir pracheen kaal se hi bhartiya lokkathaon kii yahi mukhya pravriti rahi
 Hence the characters of folklore attain happiness in the end through many adventurous and thrilling events
 sanskrit ke naatakon kii bhanti inkaa bhi ant sanyog main hi hota he
 These stories originally brought the feelings of good luck
 isiilie lokkatha kahanevaale praaia: kathaon ke ant main kuch mangal vachan bhi kaha karte hai
 Like - "just as their days turned, so also the days of seven enemies
" " It is also the goal of many folktales to bring the audience on the path of religion and duty by showing fear of various kinds of divine and natural wraths
 sari sristi us samay ek dharaatal par utar aati he jab sabhi jeev-jantuo kii bhashaa ek ho jaati he
 Somewhere a man talks to an animal, somewhere an animal talks to a bird sab ek duusare ke du:kha-sukh main sameep dikhaai padate hai
 Like folklore, folklore also does not accept any limits
 anchalon kii baat to jane dijie ye kathaayen deshon or mahadwipon kii seemayen bhi paar kar gai hai
 The specialty of these stories is that they interact with all aspects of human life
 idhar lokkathaon ke jo sangrah hue hai unamem to bahut hi thodi kathaayen aa pai hai
 Even if we talk about their preservation, but due to their characteristics, these stories, which have gained life on the basis of Shruti and Smriti, have been going on since ages
 ye kathaayen mukhya rup se teen shaileyon main kahi jaati hai
 First prose style; In this way, the whole story is told in prose in simple and regional dialect
 dwitiya gadhy padya may kathaayen - inhen champu style kii katha kaha ja saktaa he
 In such stories, poetry is often found at poignant places
 tisare prakaar kii kathaon main padya gadhy ke sthaan par ek pravaah sa hota he
 This flow has a good effect on the audience, but it does not have a singularity like the verses of the second type of stories, such as: jaat rahe daande daande, a penny penny uu kaudi ganga ke diha Ganga Vachari Balu Dihini uu baaluu main bhunjva ke diha Bhujwa poor poora dihesi - etc
 kahani kahanevaala vyakti katha ke pramukh paatr ko pehle vaakya main hi prastut kar detaa he; jaise - "ek rahe raja" yaa "ek rahaa daanav" aadi
 This characteristic does not confuse the listener of folklore
 lokajeevan main katha kehane ke saath hi use sunne kii style bhi nirdhaarit kar di gai he
 None of the listeners, until the euphoria fills, the narrator does not enjoy
 hunkaari sunne se kahanevaala andhere main bhi samajhataa rahata he ki shrota kahani ko dhyanpurvak sun rahaa he
 Legends can be mainly divided into the following departments: hindi kii anek choti badi kathaon main maanav kalyaan ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke upadesh bhare pade hai
 Such stories often teach indirectly
 isliye aisa abhas nahin hota ki unka nirmaan upadesh ke liye hi kiya gaya hoga
 Through them, inspiration is given to avoid homicides and social evils
 aisi bahut si kathaayen hai jinamein karkashaa naariyon ke kaaran parivaar ko vibhinn prakaar ke kashton kaa bhaajan hona padaa he
 The stories of the makers and sons are predominant
 inke atirikt aisi bhi kathaayen milti hai jinamein mayavi striyaan par purushon par dore daalati hai yaa jaadu tona kiya karti hai jisase katha ke nayak ko tathaa usase sambandh rakhanevaalon ko vibhinn sangharshon kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 There are many stories related to the suffering caused by the son's disobedience to the father, but, as mentioned above, all these stories end in happiness and coincidence
 jab tak katha samaapt nahin hoti tab tak paatro or mukhya rup se nayakon ko itani bhayanak ghatnaon main fasaa dekha jaataa he ki sunakar rongte khadey ho jate he
 Some listeners even say abusive words as the person who tells the story and who bothers the hero, regardless of the other audience
 unhen ye sari ghatnaayen sahi maaloom padati hai
 These include incidents arising from various types of evils
 inamen vishesh kar grihakalah evam dushcharitra or lanpat sadhu santon kii kerani tathaa ayogy naresh ke kaaran praja kaa dukhi hona dikhaaya jaataa he
 Child marriages, mismatched marriages, multiple marriages, exogamous marriages and condemnation of dowry are also found in these stories
 yogya yaa nirparaadh vyakti ayogy dusht vyakti ke changul main fasakar pareshaan hote dikhaai padate hai
 Those stories hold their special place in social stories in which the heroine primarily and the protagonist give gruesome ordeals
 aisi parikshaon main praaia: saamaajik evam vyaktigat charitra ko pradhanta di jaati he
 The hero heroines who have the right character appear to pass in such rigorous examinations
 jaise sachharitra nari jab tapt tel ke kadaahe main haath daalkar apane satitv kii pariksha detii he to kadaahe kaa tapt tel sheethal hota he
 a woman of chastity also stops the chariot of the sun
 uske bhay se bade bade daitya daanav tathaa dine bhootpret paas nahin fatakate
 Similarly, character heroes also achieve their goals by passing in formidable exams
 inamen jap tap, vrath-upwas evam unase praapt uplabdhiyaan sanjoyi gai hai
 After observing these fast stories told to wish for happiness, women observe fasts on the occasion of related festivals
 pati, putr ev bhaaiyon kii kushalta tathaa sampattiprapti inkaa lakshya hota he
 In such folk tales, the stories of "bahura", Jiutia, Karva Chauth, Ahai, Gangaur and Pidiya occupy a prominent place
 pidiya kaa vrath kumari balikaon dwaara bhaaiyon kii kushalta ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This fast runs from Kartik Shukla Pratipada to Aghan Shukla Pratipada
 ise godhan vrath katha kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 Jeevaputrikaika fasting is done for the attainment of a son and for a long life
 is avasar par bhi kai lokkathaayen kahi jaati he
 But both Chilh and Syarin had fasted on this festival at some point, but due to not being able to bear the flame of hunger, Sayarin secretly took food
 parinaam yah hua ki uske sabhi bachche mar gaye or vrath nibhaanevaali chilh ke sabhi bachche deergh jivan ko praapt hue
 When the son is received from the fast of this festival, he is named "jeut" as indicated in the folklore
 aisa lagata he ki puraanon main jivatputrika vrath kii katha ke saath jo jeemooth vaahan kii katha sambhddha he vah lokkathaon ke aadhaar par hi he, kyonki puranic jeemooth vaahan ne nargon kii raksha ke liye apni deh kaa tyaag kiya tha
 The story of Jiutia also aims to surrender to philanthropy
 karvaa chouth ke vrath main mukhya rup se us raja or rani kii kahani kahi jaati hai jo dusron ke baalkon se ghrinaa kiya karte the
 That is why he did not have a son
 ant main surya kii upasna karne par unhen putr kii prapti hui
 Lovely folklore is also found very well
 inamen mukhya rup main mata kaa putr ke prati, putr kaa mata ke prati, patni kaa pati ke or pati kaa patni ke prati tathaa bhaaiyon bahanon kaa prem dikhalaayaa jaataa he
 Often the love described in all the stories is based on duty and loyalty
 kuch kathaayen to aisi bhi hai jinamein janm janmattar kaa prem pallavit hot he
 The story of sadvraj-saranga is based on the love of past lives
 sheet vasant kii kahani main jahaan vimaata ke durvyavhaar kii baat aati he vahiin bhai-bhai kaa prem bhi charam seemaa par pahunchataa dikhaai padataa he
 There are many stories based on the love of brothers and sisters and husband
 kai kathaon main kuleen evam patiparayan striyaan kupaatr tathaa ghrunit rogon se grast patiyon ko apni seva, shraddha or bhakthi ke bal par bachaa leti hai
 Their primary purpose is to present the contents of the audience to the amusement
 balak balikaay aisi kahaniyon ko ati sheeghra yaad kar lete hai
 These stories are often short
 bhinn-bhinn jaanwaron jaise kutta, billi, gidad, nevala, sher, bhaaluu, sugga, kauwa, chilh aadi se sambandh rakhanevaali ye kahaniyaan baalkon kaa manoranjan karti hai
 The topics mentioned in these are also serious but priority is given to light things
 udhaaharan ke liye dhele par paat kii ek laghu katha len - dhele pattey main mitrataa hui
 Dhale said to the leaf, i will sit on you when the wind comes, you will not fly
 pattey ne kaha pani aane par main tumhaare upar ho jaaounga to tum galoge nahin
 Coincidentally, the arrival of storm water also happened simultaneously
 patta bhai ud gaye or dhela bhai gal gaye
 Different types of comedies also fall under this type
 ant main aisi lokkathaon kii charchaa bhi apekshit he jo jaateey paatro par aadhaarit hoti hai
 Such stories are based on Ahirs, Dhobis, barbers, seafarers, Chamars and some other heroes of certain castes
 in kathaon ko sambandhit jatiyaan hi aapas main kahati sunati hai
 Such stories are found in large quantities in the wild castes, such as the coals, the Bhils, the Dhimars, the Kharabars, the rents and the Dusadhas

 Rudolf Diesel patented the internal combustion engine in 1892 and it was named diesel engine after him, although the first real engine was built in 1895 AD
 is ingine kaa swatantra pareekshan shozotor ne 1897 i0 main aughavarg main kiya or deazal injanon kaa aam pradarshan munikh pradarshnee main 1898 i0 main hua
 In 1900, Diesel announced to the Paris Congress that after much experimentation, the final form of the operational cycle he had assumed was suction, pressure, expansion and development from a single stroke sequence of four-stroke variety
 pehle ke deazal ingine vaayu-ant:kshep ingine the or ingine ke silinder main eendhan dene ke liye bahut hi unchaa dabaav prayog main laayaa jaataa tha
 In 1910, James mckechnik developed a solid injection system, in which simple, high-pressure fuel-oil pumps were used for injection
 sphuling-prajvalan-gasolin or sampeden-prajvalan-tel injanon main antar eendhan kii prakruti main he
 Gasoline and air are mixed exactly in the carburettor of the blasting ignition engine and in the engine cylinder, this homogeneous mixture, whatever the load, is transported at a given ratio
 hawa kaa eendhan se anupaat, jo vaayu-eendhan-anupaat kehalaata he, gasolin ingine main 14
5 : 1 sthir rahata he
 Since there is no additional room for mixing air and fuel oil in diesel, the mixing work has to be completed in the cylinder itself
 deazal sadaiv hawa kii nishchit maatra ko hi sampeedit karata he, par boj ke anusaar ant:kshipt eendhan kii maatra main antar rah saktaa he
 If the burden is full, then the air-to-air ratio is 22: 1
 yadi ingine koi kaam nahin karata to anupaat 85 : 1 rahata he
 Diesel engines require a greater amount of air than gasoline engines
 vaayu-eendhan-anupaat ke tathaa sampeedan ke unchaa rahane se deazal ingine main kam eendhan kharch hota he
 Diesel motor car will work twice as much fuel as the gasoline motor car works
 deazal ingine main ek anya laabh yah he ki isamen sasta eendhan jal saktaa he or eendhan main aag lagane kii sambhaavna kam rahati he
 The design and size of diesel engines were standardized neither in Europe nor in the United States, until the mid-20th century
 deazal nirmaataaon ne apni-apni ruchi or vichaaron ke anusaar bhinn bhinn prakaar ke deazal ingine taiyaar kiye
 In this way engines of many shapes, shapes and many tricks have been made
 silinder kii vyavastha panktiyon main areey akruti arthath v kii akruti kii, pratidwandvi pistanon vaali, yaa saamaanya ek kriya vaali, yaa do kriyavaali hoti he
 In two or four round engines, the cylinders and columns remain separate, or in the same section

 Different locomotives have illuminated or preheated, air or energy cells, or are of the open chamber type
 madhya maarg ke rup main hi vibhinn akritiyon kaa vikaas hua or prayek nirmaankarta ne vistrut kshetra main upyog ke drushtikon se deazal kaa nirmaan kiya
 Classification of diesel engines has come in many ways, but the general classification is based on their speed
 jo ingine prati minute 1,200 yaa isse adhik parikraman karata he use ucch chaal ingine, jo prati minute 500 yaa isse kam parikraman karata he use nimna chaal ingine or in donon ke bich kii chaal vaale ingine ko madhya chaal ingine kehete hai
 High speed engines are made of small sacks, ie measuring 6 inches or less, so that they can compete with gasoline engines in size and power output
 silinder kii vyavastha saamanyat: paktiyon main yaa v akruti kii rahati he
 Its auxiliary parts are electric starter, oil pump, water pump and cooling system, which are integral parts of the engine
 ingine main shaayad hi pratyaksh patiwarti ekak hota ho
 If reversal is required, the reversible gear is added separately
 dahan kii suvidha ke liye ucch chalwale ingine main bahudhaa kshobhanakaksh vaayu yaa urja cell rahete hai
 There is hardly any arrangement for the auxiliary part of the piston to cool
 is prakaar ke ingine main prati silinder adhik se adhik lagbhag 30 ashwashakti viksit hoti he or isamen eendhan ke rup main halake varg kaa deazal tel prayukt hota he
 Diesel engines operate on four-stroke, or two-stroke cycles
 iskaa aashay yah he ki chaar stroke chakra ingine main piston ke puure chaar stroke, yaa crank shaft ke do parikraman, kii aavashyaktaa padati he, jabaki do stroke chakra ingine main keval do strokka, yaa crank shaft ke keval ek parikraman, kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 The four stroke cycle engine has the following functions: antargrahan - pravesh vaala valve khulata he or avarohi piston silinder main nai hawa khinchataa he
 Compression - The inlet valve closes and pressurizes air at a pressure of 500 pounds per square inch in the ascending piston cylinder itself
 shakti - sampeedan ke aghat ke ant main idhan kaa ant:kshep hota he
 It immediately ignites automatically and then spreads
 failane se shakti utpann hokar piston ko phank detii he
 Exhaust - Now the exhaust valve opens and the ascending piston expels the burnt gases outside the cylinder
 yah chakra baar baar chalata he
 The operation of the two-wheeled mono-scavenging engine also has ingestion, compression, power and exhaust functions
 avarohi piston praveshdwar or nikaasmookaaon ko kholta he
 This causes the detergent air to enter the cylinder from the entrance mouth and the exhaust cylinder is bleached and discharged
 arohi piston pravesh or nikaasmookaaon ko aachhadit kar detaa he, tathaa silinder main vaayu ko sampeedan kar, dabaav badhaakar, lagbhag 500 pound prati varg inch kar detaa he
 Fuel is now injected into the superfluous air
 idhan swat: jal uthta or prasaarit hota he, jisase piston par aghat padataa he or vah balpurvak neeche aa jaataa he
 The descending piston now opens the entry and exit doors, allowing the scavenger to enter compressed air from the entrance and remove the burnt gases from the cylinder through the exhaust gate
 is prakaar chakra puraa ho jaataa he
 If a two cycle engine is ideal, then a four cycle engine of the same expansion and speed will get twice as much power, but in reality such an ideal engine would not be achieved
 silinder main hi dwaara hone ke kaaran do chakra ikin ke aghat vastut: kam prabhaavshaalee hote hai chaar chakra ingine kii tulana main do chakra ingine se laabh yah he ki ek hi shakti utpaadan ke liye do chakra ingine halkaa hota he, isamen purje kam hote he or banaavat adhik saral hoti he
 As a result, larger engines are usually made of two-cycle and smaller smaller engines are four-cycle
 par is niyam kaa paalan sadaa nahin hota
 Both types of high quality engines are made for convenience
