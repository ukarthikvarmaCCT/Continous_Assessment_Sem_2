 isse pehle gat 19 april ko nitish ne patna ke gandhi maidan main prajapati samudaay dwaara yojit raily main lalu ke saath manch saajha nahin kiya tha, jisase bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke purv jediu or argedy ke vilay ke saath nitish or lalu ke saath aane ko lekar atakalein lagaayi jane lagi thim
 After the rally, when Lalu Prasad was asked by journalists about Nitish Kumar not being involved, he gave less importance to him and said that he could not participate in this rally due to eye operation
 raily ke dauraan lalu or sharad ne bihar vidhansabha chunaav main aapas main ekajutata or saath milakar bijepi ko parajeet karne kaa daawa kiya
 Playing the 'mandal Card', Lalu appealed to the backward castes to unite like the early 1990s to defeat the BJP
 unhone kaha ki mandal shakti ko kamandal (bijepi) ko parajeet karne ke liye ekajute hona chahie, jisane hamaare bikharaav kaa phayda uthaakar tathaa hamase jhuthe vaade kar satta main aa gayi
 Lalu told the people of the Mallah (matsya Palak) community that he had given them and other backward and very backward castes the power to raise their voice for social justice in the early 90s
 pradhanmantri narendra modi par jhuthe vaade ke jariye satta main aane kaa aarope lagaate hue lalu ne kaha ki unhone satta main aane ke ek maheene ke bheetar kalaadhan ko desh main waapas laakar sabhi garib ke bank khate main 15
 He promised to deposit Rs 5 lakh and create five crore jobs
 magar unki sarkaar ke ek saal biit gaye or apana vaada puraa karne ke bajaay unki party ab use chunavi ‘jumala’ bataa rahi he
 Lalu said that Narendra Modi promoted himself as a tea seller in the train to win the election but in his times of poverty he also sold tea and sometimes pulled a rickshaw but never tried to take political advantage by mentioning it 
 unhone modi sarkaar ke har morche par vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki apni vifaltaa se logon kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye ek baar phir ram mandir kii baat kerani shuru kar di he
 Lalu Prasad accused BJP and RSS of discussing cow for creating communal tension in the society for votes and said that these people discuss cow for the sake of pretending and showing it only, they love it No more attachment
 nishad raily ke baad bhoomi adhigrahan bill par phir adhyadesh laane ke kendriya cabinet nirnay se jude ek prashn kaa uttar dete lalu ne kaha ki ham sooyee ke nonk bhar kisaanon kii jameen unako lene nahin denge or iske liye ‘mahabharat’ ched denge
 He accused the BJP, the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of instigating people to spread communal frenzy among the people in the country, saying that the JDU and RJD will remain in alliance
 raily ko sambodhit karte hue jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne lalu kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki ham donon vidhansabha chunaav saath ladenge or bihar se hi desh ko bijepi se mukti dilaane ke liye rasta banaaenge
 The comments unhone bijepi par desh main bhram failaakar or jhooth kaa sahaara lekar satta main aane kaa aarope lagaate hue donon (jediu or argedy) ke bich aisi ekta hogi jo desh ko mukti (bijepi) kaa rasta dikhaaegi
 Bihar's Animal and Resources Minister Baidyanath Sahni, who is playing a key role in organizing the Nishad rally, appealed to his community to give power to Nitish and Lalu to defeat BJP in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections
 janata parivaar ke chah ghatak dalon ke vilay ko lekar shuru kiye gaye prayaas ke baad se aisa duusari baar hua jab lalu prasad or nitish kumaar patna ke gandhi maidan main yojit kisi raily main manch saajha kar paane main vifal rahe hai
 Earlier on April 19, Nitish did not share the stage with Lalu at a rally organized by the Prajapati community at Patna's Gandhi Maidan, leading to speculation about the coming together of Nitish and Lalu with the merger of JDU and RJD before the Bihar assembly elections
 Were being installed raily ke baad lalu prasad se patrakaron dwaara nitish kumaar ke shaamil nahin hone ke bare main puche jane par unhone use kam mahatv dete hue kaha ki vah aankh ke oparation ke kaaran is raily main bhaag nahin le sake
 During the rally, Lalu and Sharad claimed solidarity and defeated the BJP together in the Bihar assembly elections
 lalu ne ‘mandal card’ khelte hue pichhadi jatiyon se bijepi ko parajeet karne ke liye 1990 ke shuruaati daur kii tarah ekajute hone kii apil kii
 He said that Mandal Shakti should unite to defeat Kamandal (BJP), which came to power by taking advantage of our disintegration and making false promises to us

 Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of coming to power through false promises, Lalu said that he brought back the black money in the country to the bank account of all the poor within a month of coming to power
 5 lakh rupee jamaa karaane tathaa paanch karod rojgaar srijan kaa vaada kiya tha
 But a year passed after his government and instead of fulfilling his promise, his party is now calling him an election 'jumla'
 lalu ne kaha ki narendra modi ne chunaav jeetne ke liye swayan ko train main chaay bechney vaala bataakar prachaarit kiya par apni garibi ke daur main unhone bhi chaay bechi or kabhi-kabhi rickshaw khinchaa par kabhi bhi uskaa zikr kar raajnneetik laabh uthaane kii koshish nahin kii
 Accusing the Modi government of failing on every front, he said that to divert attention from his failure, he has once again started talking about Ram temple
 lalu prasad ne bijepi or aresas par vot ke liye samaaj main sampradayik tanaav utpann karne ke liye gaay kii charchaa karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ye log gaay ke naam par dhong karne or keval dikhaava ke liye uski charchaa karte hai, usase unhen koi prem or lagaav nahin he
 Responding to a question related to the Union Cabinet's decision to bring an ordinance on the Land Acquisition Bill after the Nishad rally, Lalu said, "we will not let farmers take the land of a lot of needles and will launch 'mahabharata' for it
" unhone bijepi, aresas or vishwa hindu parishad par desh main logon ke bich sampradayik unmaad failaane ke liye logon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki jediu or argedy kaa gathbandhan hokar rahegaa

 mob linching maamle main supreme court ne rajya sarkaron ke khilaaf daayar avmaananaa yachika par jald sunwaayee se inkaar kiya
 The new petition said that despite the order of the Supreme Court, many state governments are not able to stop the lynchings
 is yachika par supreme court ne kaha ki maamla normal course ke hisaab se sunwaayee par aayega
 Let me tell you that last year, the Supreme Court took a tough stand on mob lynching and said that mob violence in the name of cow protection is a crime
 koi kanoon ko haath main le, isko court kisi bhi haalat main bardaasht nahin kar sakati he
 The court had said that the responsibility of law and order rests with the state government
 iske saath hi sheersh court ne mob linching ke khilaaf guidelins jari kii thi
 In this, the Supreme Court said that mobocracy cannot be allowed in India
 kanoon kaa shashan kaayam rakhane kaa kaam sarkaar kaa he
 Any citizen can take the law into his own hands
 supreme court ne apane guidelins main yah bhi kaha ki mob linching ke khilaaf sansad kanoon banaae or sarkaron ko sanvidhan ke mutabik kaam karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, the court also said that the government should also give compensation to the victims of mob lynching
 iske baad kendriya grih mantralay ne sabhi rajyon se kaha tha ki wo mob linching par supreme court ke faislon kaa kadai se paalan karen
 In spite of all this, the incidents of mob lynching in the country are not taking its name

 congress ke yuvaraj rahul gandhi kaa helicopter aise maahaul main utaara gaya, jahaan roshni naam kii cheez nahin thi
 The landing of Rahul's chopper took place in Zero Visibility on Saturday evening in Sitapur, Uttar Pradesh
 isse pehle rahul ne upi daure kii shuruyaat aligarh se kii, jahaan se wo eta or baliya hote hue sitapur pahunche
 According to Rita Bahuguna, as the evening started to set in, the pilot barely landed a helicopter before Neem got dark
 is baat kaa thos jawaab kisi ke paas nahin tha ki aakhir congress ke yuvaraj kii suraksha ko lekar itnaa bada jokhim kyon uthaaya gaya
 Rahul did not stop here too and went to Hardoi by road
 congress bhawan main kaaryakrataaon se mili or phir chale gaye peedblyoody ke guest house

 hindi cinema or rangamanch ke ek jane-maane naam or prithviraj kapur kii viraasat kaa ek chamakta sitara, shashi kapur alavida kah gaye
 The place of this star is now in the stars
 is jahaan ko vaise bhi unki yaad kam hi aati thi
 Been ill for some time
 aspataal main bhartee shashi chupchaap khamosh ho gaye hai
 The world is seen repeating stories of memories behind
 shashi kapur prithviraj kapur se sabase chote bete the
 The father and two elder brothers, considered to be the grand father of theater, were older than the legendary show Man Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor, who made people go crazy
 aise main shashi ke liye zindagi main kuch bhi aasaan nahin tha
 Neither movies nor theater
 ghar par chote kaa dulaar mila
 Everyone's love was met and the challenge to stand up to such personalities as Peepal and Banyan
 shashi kapur ne 20 saal kii umr main 3 saal badi jenifer se kii thi shaadi, jaane- 10 yaadgaar batenghar main theatre kaa maahaul tha
 Prithviraj Kapoor used to rule the theater of Mumbai and India in those days with big and heavy set plays
 shaukat kaifi or zohara sagal un dinon ‘papaji’ yani prithviraj ke theatre kii nayikaayen thim
 Prithviraj himself was a brilliant actor and a master of strong voice
 wo awaz kamazor hone ke baad bhi mughaleazam ke abbar ko amar kar gai
 Shashi Kapoor's initial training started from the same atmosphere and theater ticket counter
 un dinon prithvi theatre ke saamne naatak dekhanewaalon kii lambii kataren hoti thim
 Shashi used to share theater work with his father
 ek mulaaqaat main unhone bataaya ki unhone papaji ke saath tikat baantne tak kaa kaam kiya tha
 Now who will say - i have a mother
 
 
 padhein: shashi kii yaad main shok sandeshlekin aage kaa rasta unhone khud bananaa shuru kiya
 It was also necessary to break out of the boundaries of a family of theater-makers and learn something new
 yahi shashi ko saadh saktaa tha or yahi unako raas bhi aayaa
 He continued to play small roles in plays and some films until his teens and then moved to Calcutta with an anglo-indian theater group
 us theatre group ko jenifer ke pita godafre candal sanchalit karte the
 Here Shashi learned new dimensions and nuances of acting
 or yaheen unhen theatre ke saath-saath godfrai kii beti jenifar se bhi ishk ho gaya
 In 'shakespeareana', acting and love rose to prominence
 or phir aage kii zindagi ke liye theatre or jenifer, donon unke humsafar ho gaye
 a rainbow hero, people talk about Shashi Kapoor and are limited to Bollywood only
 aisa karnaa shashi kapur ke vyaktitv se beimaani hogi
 Shashi Kapoor acted in films
 kai safal filmein deen
 There was a time when he was quite popular among girls due to his look, style and performance
 lekin itnaa sab hote hue bhi unka dil theatre main rahaa
 And he kept experimenting with it on screen too
 shashi kapur ne shaadi ke liye todi thi kapur khandaan kii parampara!kapur khandaan main prithviraj kapur parivaar kii mahilaon ke abhinay ko protsaahit nahin karte the
 But Shashi and Jennifer did not prefer this distinction
 shashi kapur kii filmein or naatak routine vishyon par kendrit nahin rahaa
 Nor was the canvas of experiments in cinema limited to the Kapoor dynasty and the then Indian cinema
 unhone kala filmon ke liye kaam kiya
 Worked for Indian set films in English
 ye produxns ismail marchent or james iveri ke saath hote rahe
 And thus Shashi Kapoor is among the first faces of India who were making cinema for the international world
 apane prayogon ko sarthak karne kii zid main unhone filmvaalaj ke binar tale kuch filmein banaain
 Movies like 36 Chowringhee Lane were part of the same series
 1979 main junun se shuru hua yah safar cinema to detaa rahaa lekin shashi apana sara paisa isamen khote gaye
 In 1991, Shashi gave all his strength to wonder about Amitabh and it also flopped
 yahaan se shashi tut gaye or phir production band kar diya
 When Shashi Kapoor was last seen in public, Jhalak had tears
 
 
 jenifer 1984 main ja chuki thim
 Kunal and Karan also came to the cinema but could not walk far
 shashi kapur isapar hansate hue kehete the ki wo chehre se angrez dikhte hai isliye bhartiya cinema main unako wo jagah mil nahin saki jo khud shashi kapur ko hasil thi
 In 1993, his daughter Sanjana took charge of Prithvi Theater
 lekin aage kaa safar logon ko rangamanch ke liye jagah dene par zyaada kendrit rahaa
 Instead of being limited to production for the theater itself, Shashi and his daughter engaged in providing space and awareness for the theater
 patni ke nidhan ke baad tut gaye the shashi kapur, bigadane lagi thi tabeeyataur phir kursi par shant baitha theatre ko hota, chalata, badhata dekhtaa yah indradhanushi nayak dhire-dhire ekant kaa aadmi ban gaya
 After Shammi Kapoor left, he calmed down even more
 ek baatcheet main unhone mujhe bataaya tha ki parivaar main purushon kii yah anuvaanshik samasya rahi ki javaani main achche bhale sharir umr badhane par baari hote chale jate hai
 This is also true of the Kapoor family
 shashi kapur ke kaam main na apane pita jaisaa shor or ugrata thi or na hi raaj kapur or shammi kapur jaisi raftaar
 He can keep Bollywood and theater alive and live his best life even while working comfortably, this is a big achievement
 shashi kapur shant ho gaye hai
 But Prithvi Theater in Mumbai has become Kashi again for the theater
 desh or duniya ke rangakarmi yahaan apana kaam lekar aate hai
 Shashi Kapoor's daughter Sanjana handles this responsibility
 shashi kapur is tarah jate-jate bhi jo de gaye hai, wo aage, bahut aage tak cinema or theatre kii takat banataa rahegaa
 For this great and unprecedented contribution, Shashi will be remembered as a great artist of his family and a star with a different shine

 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki aamtaur par wireles spikars ke microne yaa colling saport feechar keval naam ke hote hai, lekin ye spikar colling ke liye bhi behatar he
 Now let's talk about the subwoofer dock on the other side, so let me tell you here the downfiring drivers have been used and it is used only after attaching the stereo
 iske audio output ne bhi hamen kaaphi impress kiya
 We specially tested the electro-trans, EDM, and BDM and Classical tracks, and the base output is excellent by driver size
 keval aap sab-base ke liye thodaa negative said main rakh sakate hai
 That is, the overall audio quality is quite impressive
 compact sies main behtareen audio quality dene ke liye company kii tarif karnaa chaahunga
 You will not have any complaints about the rest of the battery
 negative factor:company ne compact sies main clin or crisp audio quality ke saath jahaan hamen ek taraf impress kiya he to vahiin iske tru wireles nahin hone par thodi dikkat bhi he
 Because the stereo speaker with subwoofer dock gives amazing audio quality but the dock cannot be used without electricity plug
 aise main jo is spikar kii keemat rakhi gai he, wo isse ittefaq nahin rakhti he
 Because if a user has to plug-in its dock for additional base then any 2 available in the market
 1 yaa 5
 Would like to invest money in 1 speaker only
 acchhee quality ke 2
 1 speakers are available in the market for less than 3 thousand rupees and if the stereo speaker has to be compromised for the base while using it separately, then it would be better to invest in speakers like Boat Stone 700A
 isamen bhi ailexa kaa saport or acchhee audio quality milti he
 i think if Lumiford has to sell this speaker in its true sense, then it should be priced around 5 thousand rupees
 baaki compact or luk iske positive factor hai hi
 Verdict: Lumiford 2
 1 Subwoofer Dock copact sies main behtareen quality, unic dizin or premium luk vaala spikar he
 We understand that its price is more than the Indian market
 reating- 8 / 10 According to the Indian Meteorological Department, a low pressure area is forming in the Bay of Bengal due to which meteorologists predict that the monsoon will cross the coastal areas and the wait for rain in West Bengal and surrounding areas including Kolkata will end
 
 iemdi ke jari aankadon ke mutabik khadi main is kam dabaav ke kshetra ke chalatemonsoonaki chaal ko raftaar milegi or agle 3-4 teen dinon main dakshin-pashchim monsoon pashchim bengal ke adhikansh ilaakon par apni pakad bana legaa
 At the same time, private weather agency Skymetka also believes that in the next 48 hours, the monsoon is likely to strengthen in the sea areas and due to this, there is a possibility of good rains in the areas of West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar in 4-5 days
 gauratlab he ki kerala ke taton par der se pahunchadakshin-pashchim monsunapichley teen dinon se sthir he
 However, the western end of the monsoon has gained a slight edge over Maharashtra, Konkan and Goa
 vahiin purvi chor bhi pichley kuch dinon se sthir bana hua he
 However, in the last few days, some parts of West Bengal and many areas of Odisha have received scattered rains and now due to the pressure rising in the Bay of Bengal, these areas are expected to receive strong rains in the next few days
 mausam vibhaag kaa daawa he ki agle kuch dinon main monsoon ek saath odisha, pashchim bengal, jharkhand or bihar ke kuch ilaakon main tej se madhyam barish hone ke asaar hai
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan knows the art of speaking in symbols
 jab 22 july ko madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan soobe main bijepi ko teesri baar satta dilaane ke makasad se jan aashirwad yatra par nikle, to mahakaal kii nagari ujjain main lage postaron se kendriya chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke chairman narendra modi nadaarad the
 But after 30 days, when Yatra went through Neemuch, considered to be the stronghold of the Sangh, Modi's supporters posted their posters in the city, in which Chauhan was given the fortune of Madhya Pradesh and Modi was told the picture of the country
 jan aashirwad yatra ke poster-binar main achaanak modi ke aane ko raajnneeti ke jaankaar id ke maukey par chouhan kii ore se bhopal main muslim topi pahanakar badhai dene kaa jawaab maan rahe hai
 From that stage, film actor Raza Murad had targeted Modi, saying that other chief ministers should learn from Chauhan as wearing a hat does not change anyone's religion
 muraad kii modi virdohi yah tippanee bijepi ko nagavar gujri thi, ''kisi ke tyohaar main shaamil hone se uskaa dharm bhrasht nahin jaataa
 Chauhan is no less popular than any other Chief Ministers, but he greets us every year on the occasion of Eid, wears a hat
 ” haalanki is par chouhan kii ore se virodh nahin jataane se unki dhur virdohi or rashtriya upaadhyaksh uma bharti khafa ho gai thim
 He had also announced to raise the matter on the party forum
 lekin do din baad chouhan ne modi kii tulana sardaar vallabh bhai patel se kii
 He said that both Modi's work and stature are like Sardar Patel's
 haalanki chouhan ne yahaan bhi aise pratik kaa sahaara liya, jo pradhanmantri pad kii daud main awwal hone ke baavjood desh ke grih mantri banakar hi rah gaye
 However, like Sardar Patel in the BJP, LK Advani has been called Iron Man, who is credited with bringing BJP to the pinnacle of power
 lekin jab pradhanmantri kii kursi kii baari ai to unhen aage badhkar atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa naam prastaavit karnaa padaa tha
 Modi factor in Shiva's 'raj' There is tremendous enthusiasm among BJP cadre about Narendra Modi, but will Modi's magic work in Madhya Pradesh? Chauhan himself has been dismissing the Modi model of development in such a way, "that model is excellent for Gujarat, but every state has its own circumstances
" ”haal hi main chouhan sarkaar ne madrason main bhagavadgita ke ansh padhaane kaa aadesh jari kiya, to muslim sanghathanon ke virodh ke baad unhone waapas lene main koi deree nahin kii
 Says a party leader, "modi is nowhere in the official posters, but at the local level, activists are putting up posters of some leaders of their choice
" vaise rajya main chouhan hi kaaphi hai
 "the state has around 7 per cent Muslim population, which can go completely against BJP in the name of Modi
 chouhan ne jis tarah mukhyamantri tirthadarshan yojana ke tahat soobe ke garib bujurgon ko dharmik sthalon par bhejne kii yojana shuru kii to unhone sabhi dharmon kaa khyaal rakhaa
 LK Advani, considered the biggest patron of Chauhan in the BJP, shared his thoughts with India Today about this pilgrimage scheme, "for this scheme, Shivraj chose to be a senior citizen of the applicant, but income tax
 Made the basis for not being the donor
 maine jis pehali train ko ravaanaa kiya vah rameswaram gai to duusari train ajmersharif gai
 Of the 17 pilgrimage sites that Shivraj has chosen for this scheme, all the cults have shrines
 ” spasht he ki rajya bijepi yahi maanakar chal rahi he ki agar modi ko vidhansabha chunaav main tavajjo di gai, to phayda kam nuksaan zyada hoga
 As it has been in power for 10 years, there is a natural anti-incumbency wave
 jisase siten kam hone kii sambhaavna to jataai ja rahi he, lekin mukhyamantri chouhan kii lokapriyata soobe main shikhar par he
 The people of the state are now seeing him as a stronger contender than Modi in central politics, as the people of Gujarat were thinking for Modi in the 2012 assembly elections
 agar modi ko vidhansabha chunaav main tarjeeh di jaati he to chouhan kaa aabhamandal modi ke saamne kamjor padegaa, jo party ke liye nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the state unit does not see any benefit in the assembly elections in the name of Modi
 'namo’ se parhez kyon ?bijepi kii rajya ikai is yatra se modi ko isliye bhi dur rakh rahi he kyonki november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ke liye chouhan hi party ke shubhankar hai
 The support of the Jan Aashirwad Yatra and the growing graph of Chauhan's popularity has boosted bjp's morale
 bijepi netaaon kaa kahana he ki khud chouhan bhi yatra main modi ko tarjeeh dene ke paksh main nahin hai
 The biggest reason for this is that Chauhan has become such a face of BJP that Muslims are not afraid
 khud adwani chouhan ko sabhi varnon, jatiyon, sampradaayon ke liye samaan chintan karne vaala netaa qaraar de chuke hai
 Whereas Muslims' perception of Modi is considered completely opposite
 raajnneeti ke jaankaron ke mutabik pradesh bijepi adhyaksh narendra tomars or chouhan ke sabase bharosemand sahyogi nahin chaahate ki modi ko poster main jagah dekar alpsankhyak matadaataaon kaa dhruvikaran hone diya jaae
 Due to his secular image, Chauhan is also a favorite in the Muslim society
 ve kabhi muslim topi pahanane se parhez nahin karte, jabaki modi ne 2011 main sadbhaavna mishan ke tahat upwas kaarykram main said imam shahi saiyad kii ore se topi pahanane se inkaar kar diya tha or sirf chadar odhi thi
 The Imam later said, "modi's denial is not just an insult to me, but an insult to Islam
" ”lekin ek muslim shikshak kaa kahana he, ''mukhyamantri chouhan ne jis tarah nishpakshta ke saath bhojashala vivaad ko suljhaayaa, uske liye ham unke behad abhaari hai
 "actually, on the occasion of Basant Panchami, there was a tense situation between the two communities in the Bhojshala regarding the worship of the two communities
 lekin rajya prashasan ne us vivaad ko sakhti se nibataya or halaat bigadgaye kii koshishen naakaam kar di gayi
 a group of Hindutvaists had expressed their displeasure over Shivraj
 modi samarthak bhi dikhaane lage joshbhale chouhan kii lokapriyata soobe main sheersh par he, lekin modi samarthak bhi kam nahin
 In the Neemuch district, considered to be the stronghold of the Sangh, the posters of Modi unofficially, the supporters of Modi have tried to call Chauhan as a national leader
 neemuch kaa mahatv isliye bhi he kyonki yah kushabhau thakare kii karmbhumi he or 1942 main yahaan aane vaale ve sangh ke pehle prachaarak the
 Hindu fundamentalists Umashankar Trivedi, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Bandopadhyay, who were elected to the Lok Sabha in 1952 after the creation of the Jana Sangh, have also been in Neemuch for a long time
 trivedi jansangh ke tikat par 1962 main neemuch-mandsaur seat se loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye the
 When Chauhan contested the state president's election in 2,000 against the wishes of the party, Thackeray was the national president
 chouhan kii jan aashirwad yatra ab tak 2,000 kimi kaa safar tay karte hue 66 vidhansabhaon main gum chuki he, jabaki yatra kaa puraa safar 8,000 kimi se adhik kaa he
 After the rest, the next leg of the journey will now start from Shivpuri district on 27 August
 mana ja rahaa he ki modi ke poster sangh ke garh maane jane vaale un ilaakon main phir dikh sakate hai
 Shivraj supporters can breathe a sigh of relief that there is no Modi supporter in the state's politics and there is no strong anti-lobby in the state against Chauhan
 rashtriya netritv khud uljhan menmodi or shivaraj ke bich hode do maheene pehle us vakt shuru hui thi jab gwalior main bijepi ke pitrupurush laalkrishna adwani ne chouhan ke madhya pradesh ko modi ke gujarat se behatar bataaya tha
 The differences between the two came to the surface on 23 June when Modi expressed his desire to rebuild the Kedarnath temple devastated in the tragedy of Uttarakhand
 lekin chouhan ne usee vakt kaha, ''hamaari pehali praathamikta aapadaa main fanse logon ko bachaana hona chahie
 The temple may be rebuilt later
 ” khud rashtriya netritv is duvidha main he ki modi ko piem ummidavaar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ghoshit kiya jaae yaa baad main
 Other BJP chief ministers are also in favor of taking a decision after the Assembly elections, so that the credit of winning in the state remains in their account rather than Modi's
 modi ko chouhan kii chunavi yatra se dur rakhane ke bare main rajya ikai ke ek netaa kehete hai ki chunki yah vidhansabha kaa chunaav he, isliye modi par focus karne kaa koi auchity nahin he
 He adds, "if Modi is declared a formal prime ministerial candidate from the party, then we will also put his poster on a specially prepared chariot
" ”yatra 27 oktober tak chalegi
 But at present all eyes are on the activist Mahakumbh to be held on September 25, in which 5-7 lakh booth workers will reach
 vahaan samooche kendriya netritv ke saath modi honge yaa nahin, isse bijepi kii raajnneeti kii disha spasht ho jaaegi
 a case of misbehavior has come to light from a female crew member in an Air India flight
 teen australian or do newzealand ke yatriyon par mahila kru member se badasluki kaa aarope he
 It is being told that the flight of Air India in which this incident occurred was coming from Sydney to Delhi
 badasluki ke aaropee yatriyon main teen mahilaayein or do purush shaamil hai
 The police stationed at Delhi airport have received a complaint in this regard

 In the complaint, the crew member has been charged with misconduct, assault and bullying

 Another statement from Chinese media has come in the wake of the stir between China and India for some time
 chini media kaa kahana he ki kyonki bharat kii ore ab lagaataar videshi nivesh aakarshith ho rahaa he, jo ki bharat ke vikaas main madadgaar hoga
 At the same time, China should quietly focus on this issue and work on its new development model
 china ke sarkari akhbaar global times ke anusaar, bharat main lagaataar bad rahaa videshi nivesh uski pragati ko dikhaata he
 China should silently watch India's progress and be ready to face it
 china ko apni vikaas kii nai niti par vichaar karnaa chahie
 The article says that through foreign investment, India is removing its troubles and is also succeeding in it
 akhbaar ne likhaa ki china ne bhi pehle is tarah kii niti apanaai thi, ab bharat bhi isamen safal ho rahaa he
 If India has remained untouched by infrastructure, skill before, then it is eliminating these deficiencies through foreign investment
 bharat kii sarkaar bhi mek in india ke jariye ise safal bana rahi he
 The Chinese media has also mentioned the list of all the companies which are investing in India including some manufacturing companies of China
 lekh ke anusaar, is baat par dhyaan dena chahie ki pichley do dashakon se bharat or china main kya ho rahaa he
 Significantly, there is an atmosphere of tension between India and China on the issue of Kidoklam
 is dauraan china kii taraf se lagaataar uksaave vaale bayaan aa rahe hai
 Earlier, in an editorial in a Chinese government newspaper, it was written directly threatening to withdraw its troops from Doklam before the situation worsens and India has to face serious consequences
 akhbaar likhata he ki beijing apni kshetreey samprabhutaa ke maamle main kisi tarah kaa koi samjhauta nahin karegaa
 At the same time, People's Daily, considered to be the main body of the Chinese government, has also republished a provocative editorial on its editorial page on Tuesday, 22 September 1962
 is lekh main usne 'kshetreey uksaave' ko lekar bharat ko chetavanee di he
 While China is claiming Doklam on the border with India, China and Bhutan, India and Bhutan say that this part belongs to Bhutan and is disputed
 kashmir main bhi dakhal de rahaa chinachini videsh mantralay ne kashmir mudde ko apana mohara banaate hue kaha ki vahaan ke halaat ne antarrashtriya samudaay kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zeng Shuang said, 'india and Pakistan are important countries in South Asia
 kashmir main niyantran rekha ke paas takaraav jari he
 This has harmed the peace and stability of both the countries but also the entire region

 "*** Today is the 187th birth anniversary of the country's first female teacher, social worker Savitribai Jyotirao Phule
 unka janm 3 janvari, 1831 ko hua tha
 She was the first principal of the first girl child school in India and the founder of the first farmer school
 savitribai jyotirav phule ko bharat main saamaajik sudhaar andolan kii ek ahm shakhsiyat mana jaataa he
 Savitribai Phule was married at the age of 9 in 1840 to 13-year-old Jyotirao Phule
 savitribai phule ne apane pati jyotirav phule ke saath milakar ladakiyon ke liye 18 skool khole
 Let me tell you, in the year 1848, the first girls school in the country was established in Pune, Maharashtra
 vahiin, atharahawaan skool bhi pune main hi kholaa gaya tha
 On January 28, 1853, he established a child homicide ban house for pregnant rape victims

 Used to throw dirt on them
 savitribai ne us daur main ladakiyon ke liye skool kholaa jab balikaon ko padhaanaa-likhaanaa sahi nahin mana jaataa tha
 Savitribai Phule was also a poetess
 She was also known as Adikavayitri of Marathi
 kai kuritiyon ke khilaaf huin khadisavitribai ne 19veen sadi main chuaa-chhot, satipratha, bal-vivaah or vidhwaa vivaah nishedh jaisi kureetiyaan ke viruddh apane pati ke saath milakar kaam kiya
 Savitribai took delivery of a widowed Brahmin woman Kashibai in her home while committing suicide and adopted her child Yashwant as her adopted son
 dattak putr yashavanth raav ko paal-poskar inhone doctor banaaya
 Jyotirao Phule, the country's first feminist, spoke of throwing away our Salamabrahman texts, Jyotirao Phule, husband of Savitribai Phule, died in 1890, when Savitribai pledged to complete her unfinished work
 uske baad savitribai kii mrityu 10 march, 1897 ko plig ke marijon kii dekhbhaal karne ke dauraan hui
 His entire life was spent in the struggle for the rights of the deprived sections of the society, especially women and Dalits
 unki ek bahut hi prasiddh kavita he jisamen vah sabko padhane- likhane kii prerana dekar jati todane or brahman granthon ko phenkane kii baat karti thim
 Go to Hindi translation of Marathi poem written on Savitri Bai's education, go read and write, become self-reliant, do hard work - accumulate knowledge and wealth; all is lost without knowledge, without knowledge we become animals, so do not sit empty, go, Go to education and end the sorrows of Lodmitas and abandoned cows, you have a golden opportunity to learn, so learn and break the bonds of caste, texts of Brahmins as soon as possible Throw

 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki nirmala sitaraman ke bayaan ko lekar kiya ja rahaa daawa galat he
 He made that statement in another context
 buudhvaar ko rashtravaadi congress party kii saansad supriya sule ne pyaaj kii keemton se jude sawaal puche the
 The Finance Minister was replying to this when a Member of Parliament (who does not appear in the video clip) interrupted him and asked, "do you eat Egyptian onions?" Sitharaman replied in the middle of his reply He said, 'I don't eat onions, so don't worry
 'AFWA ne sansad main hui bahes ko dhyaan se suna or paaya ki sitaraman ne yah nahin kaha tha ki pyaaj kii keemton se 'mujhe koi fark nahin padataa'
 Rather he had said, 'I don't eat garlic and onion much, so don't worry
 main aise parivaar se aati hum jahaan lahasun or pyaaj kaa zyada istemaal nahin hota
 He also did not say 'na onion khaungi, na onion khaenenge', as is being claimed on social media
 loksabhaa tivi ne us bahes kavidioplod kiya he jahaan par unka bayaan suna ja saktaa he
 Later, Finance Minister Sitharaman's office tweeted, '

 is dashak ke sabase tufaani ballebaaz virendra sahvaag ne antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas kaa elaan kar diya
 With this, a career was also ended which completely changed the definition of cricket on its own
 sahvaag bemauf andaaz main ballebaazi karte hue kehete rahe hai ki wo 5 ran par khel rahe hon, 195 par hon yaa 295 par agar unhen lagegaa ki gend chakke ke liye he to wo chakka hi lagaayenge
 Sehwag is the most different in world cricket due to his style
 sahvaag ek aise khilaadi hai jo apane dam par haari hui baazi jeetne kii kala bakhubi jaanate hai
 The record of making the fastest triple century is still in Sehwag's name
 viru ne 300 ran sirf 278 gend par banaae
 Veeru has no match in Test as well as ODI
 viru kii tufaani ballebizi kaa andaaza west indies ke kilaaf unki 219 ran kii pari se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Sehwag, famous for his explosive batting, was also criticized but he never cared
 sahvaag ne 2013 main bharat ke liye aakiri baar test or vanade khelaa
 His international cricket career got a break due to poor form but this did not change his style of playing
 viru ne kaha tha ki unhone pehle hi faisla kar liya tha ki wo apane 37wein janmdin ke din sanyas le lenge
 Fans who have not seen Vivian Richards batting can say that we have seen Sehwag playing
 tippaniyan Some of his fellow players on Twitter said something like # thankyousehwag

 sahvaag apane andaaz kii vajah se world cricket main sabase juda nazar aate hai
 Sehwag is a player who knows the art of winning a losing game on his own
 sabase tej tiharaa shatak banane kaa record ab bhi sahvaag ke naam he
 Veeru scored 300 runs off just 278 balls
 test hi nahin vanade main bhi viru kaa koi sani nahin rahaa he
 Viru's stormy batting can be gauged from his 219-run knock against the West Indies
 apni visphotak ballebaazi ke liye mashhoor sahvaag kii aalochana bhi khub hui lekin unhone isi kabhi parvaah nahin kii
 Sehwag played Test and ODI for India for the last time in 2013
 karaab form kii vajah se unke antarrashtriya cricket kariyar par brake zarur lag gaya lekin isse unke khilne kaa andaaz nahin badla
 Veeru said that he had already decided that he would retire on his 37th birthday
 vivian richards ko ballebaazi karte na dekhne vaale phens kah sakate hai ki hamane sahvaag ko khelte dekha he
 The comments twitor par unke saathi khilaadiyon ne kuch you # thankyousehwag kaha
 In the odis and T20s, Team India captain MS Dhoni tweeted, 'I did not see Vivian Richards playing but i can say that i have seen Sehwag deliver the bowlers' sixes
 ' Didn't see Viv Richards bat in person but i can proudly say i have witnessed Virender Sehwag tearing apart the best bowling attacks — Mahendra Singh Dhoni (@msdhoni) October 20, 2015 So Test captain Virat Kohli wrote that thank you for the way you showed me

 The Indian team has to go through difficult foreign tours next year in 2018 and captain Virat Kohli said that he will rest some key batsmen before that
 newjiland or srilanka ke khilaaf gharelu siries khilne ke baad bharat agle saal janvari main dakshin africa daure par jayega
 On this tour, Team India has to play three Tests, six odis and three T20 Internationals
 dakshin africa daure ke baad team england jaaegi jahaan use teen tii-20, teen vanade or paanch test match khilne hai
 The series will begin in July 2018
 kohli ne kaha, ki 'keval ballebaaj hi nahin balki team management aane vaale saptahon main gendbaajon ko bhi rotate karegaa taaki ve videshi dauron ke liye tarotaaja rahen
 It is a very busy schedule
 hamen bhavishya ko lekar baat kerani hogi
 Kohli said, "if you look at the New Zealand team, they have not played cricket after the Champions Trophy
" uske khilaadiyon ko rest kaa kaaphi mauka mila
 In big tournaments this can make a difference
 kohli ne kaha, ‘har kisi ko vaapasi ke liye samay kii jarurat hoti he khaastaur par tej gendbaajon ko, isliye abhi ham yah umesh yadav or mohammad shami ke saath kar rahe hai
 We want to freshen them up before the test series
 captain kohli ne kaha, 'ham thake hue khilaadi nahin chaahate or is par ham baat bhi kar chuke hai
 Even some of the leading batsmen will definitely be rested in future as the upcoming overseas tour is very important
 ' The last foreign tour of this year of the Indian team, which has been criticized due to poor play on the last two overseas tours, starts against Australia from Wednesday
 donon timen teen tii-20 maichon kii siries kaa pehla match gaba stadium main khelengi
 India recently defeated the T20 World Winning Team West Indies at their home
 is siries main bhi vah apane isi vijayi kram ko jari rakhana chaahegi
 Brisbane T-20: India's wicket against the breathless Kangaroos was rested by Virat Kohli against the heavy West Indies

 Bumrah was instrumental in taking South Africa for 194 runs in the first innings by taking the first five wicket hall of his Test career
 bumraah ne palata pasajohanisburg main bumraah mejabaan team par kahar banakar toote or unhone paanch africa ballebaajon ko pavilion lautaa kar team india kii match main vaapasi kara di
 Hashim Amla (61), Africa captain Faf du Plessis (8), Quinton de Cock (8), Andile Pheilukwayo (9) and Lungi Nagidi (0) were the victims of Bumrah

 Let us tell you that Bumrah has been very successful in limited overs cricket due to his special action and yorker, so far he has taken 56 wickets in 31 odis and 40 wickets in 32 T20 Internationals
