 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 In 1961, the conference of 'ifla' was held in Paris in collaboration with UNESCO, the question of definition of this word was also considered and by consensus the following definition of the word was finally accepted: 'iffla' dwaara sweekrut ukt paribhaasha main mukhya teen arth shaamil kiye gaye hai : Under this, every type of study of the book in its external form, which leads to knowledge of the history, construction, etc
 of the book, is included

 The bibliography is actually a form of catalog, but the two words are not synonymous
 soochiptr se kisi ek pustkaalay yaa sangrahalay main uplabdh sahitya kaa gyaan hota he
 The catalog can be only a list of texts published by a publisher and a list of texts sold by a bookseller
 soochiptr main jo granth sammilit kiye jate hai, unka nunatam vivaran, de dena hi paryaapt samajha jaataa he
 With this only knowledge of the existence of a scripture is available
 soochiptr taiyaar karne kii vidhi bhi saral he
 It is either prepared by looking at the texts or with the help of another catalog
 kabhi kabhi soochiptr taiyaar karne main duusare pustakaalayon tathaa vidwaanon kii sahaayta bhi lee jaati he
 From the description of the texts given in the catalog, a person cannot ascertain under what circumstances a book was printed and if any changes, revisions were made in later editions of that book, then why? granthsuchee kaa kshetra bhi yadhyapi kuch anshon tak simit rahata he, tathaapi uski seemaa ek ore yadi nunatam ho sakati he to duusari ore ati vistrut bhi
 Under the bibliography, a list of texts related to a single author, publisher, printer, subject, period or country can be taken
 yadi kisi pustkaalay main uplabdh kisi ek lekhak, prakaashak, mudrak, vishay, kaal yaa desh se sambandhit granthon; yaa anya prakaar kii granth sadrush saamagree, yatha sabhi prakaar kaa prakashit aprakashit sahitya, panflate, patrapatrikas, samachaarpatr or unamem chhapi rachanaaon ke 'riprint', nakshe, chitra, microfils saamagree, hastlikhit granth aadi kii suchi kisi vishesh uddeshy evam kram se taiyaar kii jaay to use granthsuchee kaha jaayga
 It will not be irrelevant to take an example to make it more clear
 nagariprachaarini sabha, kaashi, ke aryabhasha pustkaalay main uplabdh sabhi granthon kii suchi ko 'aryabhasha pustkaalay kaa soochiptr' kaha jaayga
 If a list of all the texts related to and written by Premchand is available there, it will be considered as 'bibliography of Premchand', although it can also be called 'catalog of Premchand Krit and literature related to Premchand' in Aryabhasa library
 granthsuchee kisi na kisi prakaar kii seemaa se pratibandhit rahati he
 This range can be very wide and very small
 yadi ukt udhaaharan main premchand dwaara likhit tathaa unase sambandhit keval usee sahitya kii suchi taiyaar kii jaae jo kisi ek nishchit avadhi main prakashit hua ho, yatha 1920 se 1930 ke bich, to yah granthsuchee 'premchand' vishay tak to simit he hi, ek nishchit kaal se bhi simit he
 This bibliography, if one wishes, can also be limited to 'premchand's Story Literature: 1920- 1930'
 iske vipareet yadi koi chaahe to sansar kii sabhi bhashaaon main anuvaadit or prakashit premchand krit or unase sambandhit sampurna sahitya ko bhi sammilit kar saktaa he
 In such a situation the limit of bibliography will be greatly increased
 kehane kaa mantavya yahi he ki granthsuchee hameshaa kisi na kisi disha tak simit rahati he, par iske vipareet soochiptr kaa kisi ek vishay, kaal yaa sthaan tak simit hona aavashyak nahin
 The bibliography is also limited in its purpose as compared to the catalog
 vishay evam uddeshy ke anusaar hi granthsuchee main granthon kaa kram rahata he tathaa granthsuchee kii ek mukhya visheshta yah bhi hoti he ki apni nirdhaarit seemaa main vah sarvangasampurna hoti he yadhyapi aajkal kuch nae evam kathin vishyon ke liye keval chune hue sahitya kii granthsuchee bhi sankalit kii jane lagi he
 The second major difference between a bibliography and a catalog is that the library is used primarily by library members or researchers to obtain the required texts or to obtain the necessary briefs in relation to them
 iske vipareet granthsuchee kaa upyog kisi ek nishchit evam simit uddeshy ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 The name of the author generally and its date of publication can be known in relation to a book, but from the description given in the bibliography, all kinds of possible possible details, such as the author, name, value, number of pages, publisher, publication and Date, size type, version, any important facts related to publication and other similar details are also available
 granthsuchee kai prakaar kii ho sakati he, par iske mukhya rup nimna likhit hai : That is, a list of all the literature published in a country
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kisi desh main prakashit sampurna sahitya us desh kii janata ko bina kisi aapatti ke sulabh hona chahie
 No person or institution can buy all published literature
 at: yah sahitya kisi aisi jagah surakshit rakhaa janaa chahie jahaan sabhi log samaan rup se uskaa upyog kar saken
 This work is possible only by the government of the country
 isi uddeshy se sansar ke praaia: sabhi deshon main rashtriya pustkaalay sthapit kiye gaye hai
 But only this problem is not solved
 pustkaalay main kya kya sahitya sangrahit kiya gaya he, tathaa koi granth he yaa nahin, yah jaanane kaa koi saadhan hue bina pustkaalay kaa puraa puraa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Secondly, the culture of any country is not so rich that it continues to thrive without taking anything from other countries
 aajkal jab ki vigyaan evam maanavtaa kii drushti se samast vishwa kaa ek sutara main aabaddh hona aavashyak samajha jane laga he, anusandhankartaaon ke liye bhi yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki ve duusare deshon main hui tathaa ho rahi pragati se avgat rahen
 Therefore, it becomes the duty of the government of every country to present a means by which not only the people of the country but also the foreigners also get information about the published literature in the country
 rashtriya granthsuchee isi uddeshy kii purti karti he
 The national bibliography gives details of all the texts of all types and all subjects published in a country
 yah suchi praaia: deshavishesh ke rashtriya pustkaalay main sangrahit sahitya ke aadhaar par taiyaar kii jaati he
 So far, no national bibliography has been prepared in any country, which contains the details of the entire literature published in that country
 rashtriya granthsuchee vastut: isi sadi kii dein he
 Even in a country like Britain, there was no national bibliography before 1950
 vahaan 1950 se british neshnal bibliography kaa prakaashan aarambh hua
 This list is prepared on the basis of the texts received under the copyright law in the National Library - Library of the British Museum
 bharat main 1958 kaa varsh granthsuchee kii drushti se atyant hi mahatvapurn mana janaa chahie jabaki vahaan rashtriya pustkaalay granthsuchee kaa prakaashan aarambh hua
 This list keeps a description of all the texts of all languages obtained under the copyright law in the National Library of India, but it is unfortunate for Hindi and other Indian languages that this list is published only in Roman script
 is prakaar 1958 tathaa uske baad bharat main prakashit sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon ke sahitya kii samasya to bahut kuch hal ho chuki he, par 1958 se purv bharat main prakashit sahitya kii koi bhi granthsuchee abhi tak na to uplabdh he or na tatsambandhi kaai yojana hi vichaaradhin he
 But India should be proud that the publication of national bibliography has started here, while in many countries no national bibliography has been published yet
 yahan ke rashtriya pustakaalayon ke soochiptr kaa upyog keval ve hi log kar sakate hai jo swayan pustkaalay ja saken
 Apart from this, the only other solution is to get information about a bibliography by correspondence
 par ab unesco ke prabhaav evam sahyog se kuch deshon main rashtriya granthsuchee ke prakaashan kii yojanaayen vichaaradhin hai or aashaa kii ja rahi he ki aagaamee do dashakon tak praaia: sabhi deshon main rashtriya granthsuchee prakashit hone lagegi
 In the context of the national bibliography, it is natural to pay attention to the world bibliography
 vishwa granthsuchee ke liye vishwa main 18veen sadi se hi samay samay par anek praytn kiye gaye, par koi bhi praytn safal na ho sakaa
 Keeping in mind the world bibliography, the Royal Society of Britain first started publishing a catalog of scientific literature, but soon this effort had to be postponed
 iske baad ukt soochiptr ke poorak ke rup main rvagyanik sahitya kaa antarrashtriya soochiptr kii yojana bani
 This plan also could run only for some time
 ukt donon yojanaon kii asafalataa se vishwa granthsuchee se sambandhit anek samasyaon kaa pataa chalaa jinaki ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan saadhaarant: nahin gaya tha
 Despite these two schemes, the Royal Society continues to do something in this area
 koi bhi pustkaalay kitna hi adhik dhan vyay kyon na kare, sabhi deshan kaa sampurna prakashit sahitya vah nahin kharid saktaa
 Anthony Panizzi, the librarian of the British Museum, wanted to keep in this library the best books published in all the countries of the world
 isi uddeshy se unhone vishwa kii sabhi bhashaaon ke shreshth sahitya ko praapt karne kaa praytn kiya par kai kaarnon se ve apane prayatnon main safal na ho sake
 The Library of Congress of America, which is considered to be the largest library in the world, cannot be called a world library
 par vishwa ke bade pustakaalayon ke soochiptr bahut kuch anshon main 'vishwa granthsuchee' kii kami kii purti kar dete hai kyonki in pustakaalayon main vishwa ke sabhi deshon main prakashit upyogi evam mahatvapurn granthon kaa sangrah karne kaa praytn prarambh se hi kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The importance of world bibliography in the modern era can only be gauged from the fact that almost every department and branch of UNESCO is involved in some way in the development of bibliography and to prepare bibliography of various subjects and solve the problems related to them
 UNESCO has set up different committees for this
 vishwa main granthsuchee kii vartmaan sthiti main sudhaar ke uddeshy se 1950 main paris main unesco ke tatwadhan main jo antarrashtriya kanference hui thi, uske sadsy sarvasammati se is nishkarsh par pahunche the ki rashtriya str par prayek desh main 'granthsuchee centre' sthapit kiya janaa chahie, jahaan granthsuchee se sambandhit vividh aavashyak kaary kiye ja saken
 Later, with the help of these centers, the national bibliography can also be published there
 rashtriya str par sthapit ye granthsuchee centre vishwa granthsuchee ke liye neenv ke samaan upyogi honge
 Catalogs can also take the form of a bibliography to some extent
 yadi kisi pustkaalay main uplabdh keval kisi ek nishchit vishay ke granthon kaa soochiptr taiyaar kiya jaay to use kuch anshon tak granthsuchee ke rup main upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The contents of most of the famous and large libraries subsequently acquire the importance of the subject bibliography
 soochipatron main shaamil kiye gaye granthon kii visheshta praaia: yah nahin hoti ki ve kisi lekhakavishesh kii kritiyaan hote hai, yaa isaliye ki sabhi granth kisi ek vishay se sambandhit hote hai, yadhyapi kuch soochipatron ke sambandh main uparyukt donon yaa koi ek baat sahi bhi ho sakati he
 But the specialty of those texts is that they are published by any one publisher, received at a bookseller's shop or they are in the collection of a library
 par bade pustakaalayon ke soochiptr kaa mahatv granthsuchee ke samaan hota he
 For this reason, the lists of the British Museum Library of Britain, the Library of Congress of America and the 'bibliotheque National' of France are counted in the bibliographic category
 inke sankalan kaa mukhya uddeshy tathaa inamen shaamil granthon kii mukhya samanta keval yah hoti he ki ve kisi ek vishay se sambhddha hote hai
 This bibliography can be in contemporary texts like other types of bibliographies and also in earlier texts
 yah vishad bhi ho sakati he yaa keval chune hue sahitya kii bhi, isi prakaar usamen shaamil granthon ke vivaran ke saath tippanee bhi ho sakati he tathaa nahin bhi
 It can also be published in the prescribed time in the form of a magazine, as a small booklet and also as an independent book
 vishvavidhyalayon kii pathyapustakon tathaa vaigyanik granthon ke kuch parichchhedon ke ant main or kuch mahatvapurn anusandhanatmak granthon ke ant main kabhi kabhi swatantra adhyay yaa parishisht ke rup main lekhak 'sahaayak granthsuchee', 'anya sahitya', 'pathneey sahitya' yaa upyogi sahitya, aadi sheershak dekar kuch granthon kii suchi dete hai
 Supporting bibliographies are sometimes given at the end of important articles published in some paperbooks
 isi prakaar vishvakoshon evam shodh lekhon ke ant main sankshipt granthsuchee di hoti he
 These too should be considered as a form of bibliography
 vishwa ke sabhi deshon main prakashit granthon kii nirantar vruddhi ke saath hi saath lekhak tathaa vishay granthsuchee kii aavashyaktaa bhi badhati jaati he
 The bibliography of almost all famous authors has been published in Western countries
 kuch lekhakon kii to kai granthsuchiyaan alag alag uddeshy se prakashit hui hai
 But the problem is not solved only with the publication of the bibliography
 kis kis lekhak kii tathaa kis kis vishay kii evam kis prakaar kii granthsuchiyaan uplabdh hai, yah jaanane ke liye jab tak koi saadhan na hon, tab tak uplabdh granthsuchiyon kaa puraa puraa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 For this purpose, the compilation of 'bibliographies of Bibliographies' has attracted the attention of Western scholars and so far many big 'bibliographies' have been published in European languages
 is sambandh main theodor westerman dwaara sankalit 'e world bibliography ov bibliography' mukhya rup se ullekhneey he
 In this huge book, 84, 403 bibliographies published in the languages of the world give a detailed description
 isi sadi ke aarambh main granthsuchee kaa yah nayaa rup prakaash main aayaa he
 In this way, there is a detailed introduction to published unpublished important literature of a subject
 hindi main bhi is prakaar kii ek granthsuchee prakashit ho chuki he
 In addition to the above mentioned types of bibliographies, there are other types of indexes and abstracts
 kisi bhi granthsuchee ke sankalan main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn evam aavashyak baat yah he ki uskaa uddeshy spasht hona chahie
 The order of the texts to be included in the bibliography depends on its purpose
 kisi bhi granthsuchee main shaamil kiye janevaale granth nimnlikhit kramon main se kisi bhi kram main rakhe ja sakate hai : Alphabetical order
 lekhak ke namaanusaar, granth ke namaanusaar, vishay ke namanusar yaa prakaashan sthaan ke namaanusaar
 Chronology, vargeekrut, Geographical order granthon ke prakaranusaar
 If the purpose of the bibliography is only to give a description of each book, then it would be appropriate to keep the names of all the authors in alphabetical order
 yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy kisi vishay ke itihaas kaa vikaas batalaana yaa kisi prasiddh lekhak ke sahityavikas kaa parichay dena he to sabhi granth kalkram arrangement se rakhe jane chahie
 If readers are to be guided in relation to useful and important texts, this can be done by giving subject indexes in alphabetical order at the end of the bibliography and if the purpose of the bibliography is to tell only which texts have been written on the subject so far
 If and what part is still lacking, then on the basis of any classification method, the entire literature can be put in classified order
 isi prakaar yadi granthsuchee main shaamil kiye janevaale granthon kaa mahatv kisi sthaan yaa bhugolic kshetra ke kaaran he to sabhi sahitya bhugolic kram main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Like bibliography, this meaning is also used in a limited area
 yah arth vastut: mashin yug se purv tathaa mashin yug ke aarambh main prakashit granthon ke liye hi mukhya rup se prayukt hota he
 In modern times, scientific instruments have developed so much, and so much progress has also been made in the field of printing that millions of copies of a single book can be printed without any manual labor, at the same time It is also unlikely that there will be any difference between these copies
 at: aadhunik kaal main mudrit granthon ke 'varnan' kaa to koi prashn hi nahin uthta
 Granthavarna refers not to the content of the book but to the various forms of the external form of the book, its construction and existence
 mashin yug se purv jab granth haath se likhe jate the, is baat kii apeksha hi nahin kii ja sakati thi ki ek hi granth kii koi bhi do pratiyaan prayek prakaar se samaan hogi
 Moreover, their paper could not be even the same, then there was even more inequality in handwriting, painting, paragraphs, 'proof' inaccuracies, margin, etc
 mudrankala ke avishkaar ke lagbhag 100 varshon yaa isse kuch adhik samay baad tak bhi mudrankala kaa vikaas acchhee tarah nahin ho paaya tha
 Even at this time, most of the printing related work was done by manpower
 at: yah swaabhaavik tha ki ek hi granth kii do pratiyon main kuch na kuch antar ho
 Looking at the printed texts of that period, it is found that there is a surprising disparity in composing, makeup, proof, decoration of forms, etc
 in two copies of the same text at the same time and simultaneously
 aadhunik kaal main, jabaki pracheen kaal ke hastlikhit granthon or mudrankala ke avishkaar ke praanrabhik varshon main mudrit granthon ke sangrah kii ore kalaparkhiyon evam saahitiyik sansthaaon kaa dhyaan aakrisht hua he tathaa hastlikhit granthon ke sangraahak unchi unchi keemton par prasiddh lekhakon kii pandulipiyaan or unki pustakon ke praarambhik sanskaran ekatrit karne lage hai, unki suvidha ke liye yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki aisi granthsuchiyaan taiyaar kii jaayan jinamein mul varnan ho
 By looking at this description, the difference between the original and the fake copy can be easily made and the art collectors can not be cheated by cheaters and fraudsters
 kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki paashchaatya deshon main anek dhokhebaajon ne prasiddh lekhakon kii pandulipiyon kii hoobahoo nakal kar tathaa unke granthon ke 'jaali pratham sanskaran' taiyaar kar lakhon-karodon rupye kamaaye hai
 Later on being informed of the situation, the collectors have to leave their hands
 kalapremiyon evam sangraahakon ko jaalsaajon se bachaane ke liye granthsuchee main jo varnan diya jaataa he vah apane aapmen purna tathaa kisi granth kii pahchaan ke liye paryaapt hota he
 For the description of Western texts, the scholars have accepted some special methods of scripture
 granthavarnan vastut: ek prakaar kii sankethik bhashaa he jise keval anbhavi hi samaj saktaa he
 There are different methods and rules for handwritten texts and printed texts
 isi prakaar granthsuchee ke uddeshy ke anusaar granthavarnan bhi kam yaa adhik diya jaataa he
 If the purpose of a bibliography is to prepare only a 'list', then necessary brief description of the texts to be included in the list is given, but if the purpose of the bibliography is to give a detailed introduction of the texts, then from the first page to the last page of the book Full description of, full description of pictures, the main salient features of each page, if the margin, order of paragraphs, composition The number of lines in each page, if there are more or less lines in a page, information about it, description of a line if it starts at a particular place, etc
 
 yadi kisi pracheen granth kii do pratiyaan uplabdh hon to unki bhautik banaavat kii aapas main tulana kii jaati he or yadi unamem koi antar ho tois tathy kaa ullekh 'granthavarnan' main kar is ore sangraahakon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya jaataa he
 The difference between two copies of a single text does not mean that one copy is fake
 donon pratiyon main antar hone par bhi donon hi pratiyaan asli ho sakati hai, kyonki unamem antar hone ke anek sambhavit kaaran ho sakate hai
 In the context of bibliography, one has to consider these reasons in detail and reach a conclusion
 granth kii suchi main is prakaar kaa jo vistrut granthavarnan diya jaataa hai usase kalapremiyon, sangraahakon evam pustakalayadhyakshon ko to suvidha hoti hi he par uskaa upyog yaheen par samaapt nahin ho jaataa
 Literary terms also have some significance of the texts
 granth tathaa isi prakaar kii anya saamagree, jiske dwaara vichaaron ko vyakt kiya jaataa he, praaia: rachayita ke vichaaron kaa sahi praturup nahin hoti
 Sometimes it happens that the writer is unable to find the right words to express his thoughts properly and sometimes he uses such words which mean something else in the view of the reader or listener
 is sambandh main ek anya tathy kii ore bhi dhyaan dena aavashyak he
 If the author himself prints his book or makes handwritten copies of it, then there is often no possibility of any kind of confusion or use of the wrong word, but the situation is different
 lekhak kii kalam evam mastishk se prasut koi granth jab mudrit rup main saamne aata he to uske us rup ke liye lekhak nahin varan kai anya vyakti jimmedaar hote hai
 The literary knowledge of these people is usually zero and they are often ignorant of the subject of which they are preparing
 aisi sthiti main lekhak ke saath puraa puraa nyaay nahin ho paata
 Apart from this, it is sometimes seen that what the writer writes in his original copy, when seen in printed form, its meaning seems to change
 yadi lekhak swayan pruf padhane main kaaphi saavdhaanee rakhkar us sambhaavna ko bahut kuch kam kar de tathaa is prakaar apane vichaaron ko vyakt karne ke madhyam par thodaa bahut niyantran kar le, to bhi yah niyantran sampurna rup se 'trutiheen' hone kaa koi pramaan nahin
 The fact is that the author does not do everything by himself
 swayan pruf padhane ke baad bhi use baad kii kriyaaon ke liye dusron par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Therefore, 'error is due to human', on the basis of this theory, it can be said that there is a possibility of any mistake by other persons even after the writer is very careful
 kai prasiddh lekhakon ne sweekaar kiya he ki unke granth bhautik rup main thik vahi nahin hai jaisi unhone kalpana kii thi
 Therefore, to remove the difference between imagination and reality, a scripture is required
 yathatathy granthavarnan saahitiyik samiksha ke liye sethu ke samaan he
 Before evaluating the subject matter of a book, the reviewer needs to be convinced that the copy of the book he is using for review has been prepared on the basis of the author's original text
 yadi aisa nahin he to use granth ke sabhi sanskarnon kii pratiyaan dekhakar unka aapas main sambandh sthapit karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Because the history of which book is actually an important part of the literature history of its author
 sameekshak kaa granth ke paath kaa itihaas gyaat hona isaliye bhi aavashyak he ki vah us sanskaran kii pahchaan kar sake jo lekhak kii mul pandulipi ke adhiktam nikat ho yaa jisamen lekhak ne swayan koi sanshodhan kiya ho
 The reviewer should also know what new material was added to the text later or excerpts from it, changes, additions made by the author himself or with his permission or by the printer, publisher or any other person
 by
 kisi granth ke sabhi sanskarnon kii tithiyaan tathaa unka kram bhi sameekshak ko gyaat hona chahie
 It is clear that it is not the task of the reviewer to obtain or prepare all such details
 uskaa kaary to keval granthvishesh kii vishaywastu kaa adhyayan kar uske gundosh kii parakh karnaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to give bibliography in the bibliography to help the reviewer
 3- granth kaa bhautik padaarth ke rup main adhyayan, jaisaa prarambh main kaha gaya he, is arth ke antargat un sabhi vidhiyon evam vastuon kaa adhyayan evam itihaas aata he jo kisi granth ke nirmaan main sahaayak hote hai
 Here the text of the text does not mean anything, the skilled bibliographer only looks at how this text came to be and all the prescribed valid methods of the creation of the text are used or not
 vyapak rup main is adhyayan ke antargat kaagaj nirmaan kii vidhi, vividh prakaar ke kaagajon main antar, tathaa unke gundosh, vividh mudran paddatiyaan tathaa unki visheshtaayen, mudran paddati ke antargat aanevaali vividh kriyaayein, tip ke nirmaan kii vidhi, mudranyantron kii karypranani, jild bandhaai ke vividh rup aadi prayek baat par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Looking at the above three meanings, it is clear that the first two meanings are complementary because the Grathavanavarna is given in the bibliography itself and there is no difference between the bibliography and the catalog in the absence of description
 tisare arth ke sabandh main vidwaanon ne samay samay par pratwaad uthaae hai or prashn kiya he ki granthsuchee ke sankalankarta ko mudrankala kaa gyaan hona aavashyak nahin
 But when modern scholars have accepted that no person can do bibliography without knowledge of printing
 vastut: granthsuchee ukt teenon arthon kaa samanvay he
 The bibliography is the same in which the bibliography is given according to a certain system
 prasiddh vidvan dow greg ke matanusaar granthsuchee se taatpary granth kaa bhautik rup main adhyayan he, uski vishaywastu se yahan koi sambandh nahin
 In the same way, listing only the list of texts with the opinion of the famous American scholar Dr
 Boers will be called indexing, but if the texts in that list are described as physical material, then in true sense it is called 'scientific and methodical bibliography'
 should go
 dow boars to ek kadam or aage badhkar aisi granthsuchee ko vishleshnatmak granthsuchee banane ke paksh main he
 They believe that the description of a book is given in the bibliography, its purpose is to find the 'ideal copy' of that book
 adarsh prati se unka abhipraay vah prati nahin he jisamen koi dosha na ho, varan vah prati he jo mudrak ke yahan prarambh main nikali ho, bhale hi usamen paath sambandhi kitni hi ashuddhiyaan kyon na hon
 To get such a perfect copy of 'ideal copy', it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of the art of printing
 granthavarnan main un sab kriyaaon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he jo kisi granth ke nirmaankaal main prayukt kii gai hon
 Knowledge of printing activities is helpful not only from the point of view of the original text of a book, but also to know the history of that book
 mudrankala kaa gyaan hone par ek hi granth ke vividh sanskarnon ko dekhakar us granth kaa puraa itihaas batalaaya ja saktaa he
 Physiologically microscopic study of a text is helpful in solving controversial questions related to its text
 iske saath hi saath kabhi kabhi vah aisi baton kii ore bhi dhyaan aakarshith karata he jinpar vidwaanon kaa dhyaan pehle na gaya ho
 It is not only important from the scientific point of view, it cannot be denied from the point of view of research as well
 dow grag ke shabdon main yadi sahitya shabd ko uske simit arth main na lekar vistrut arth main len to granth varnan ko sahitya kaa vyakaran kahana chahie
