 Usually, when Parliament votes on antitrust or fails in a vote of confidence, a government has to react in two ways: is prakriya ko yaa to sanvaidhanik parampara ke madhyam se aupchaarik rup diya jaataa he, jaisaa ki britain, canada or australia jaise westoministar style kii sansadon main hota he yaa germany or spain jaise deshon ke maamalon main spasht rup se likhe gayi samvidhan ke jariye
 In a Westminster system, if the government itself decides to resign or is forced, the emperor or viceroy may ask the official opposition party if they are ready to form the government

 In Canada's Northwest Territories and Nunavut Canada's consensus government system, where the Prime Minister is elected from among and by members of non-party legislatures, the Prime Minister and Cabinet can be removed by voting on a no-confidence motion and its Members are allowed to elect the new Prime Minister
 ) The legislature in the presidential system can sometimes present a no-confidence motion, as opposed to United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson in 1950, and more recently against US Attorney General Alberto Gonzalis, but these proposals only The effect is symbolic
 raashtrapati pranali main bhi aam taur par mahabhiyog kii prakriya hoti he, jiske dwaara ek kaaryakari yaa nyaayik adhikari ko hataaya ja saktaa he

 But according to the projects of this constitution, as compared to the constitution of 1956, the President of Pakistan was given many rights, and basically a presidential system was formed
 1956 ke samvidhan kii tarah hi 1962 kaa samvidhan bhi adhik samay tak nahin rah paaya
 The second martial law in Pakistan was imposed on 26 March 1969 when President Ayub Khan abolished the constitution in 1962 and handed over power to the commander-in-chief of the army, General Aga Mohammad Yahya Khan

 hawk-eye is a complex computer system used in cricket, tennis and other sports to mark the path of the ball and represent the path ahead of it based on statistics as a moving image
 In some sports like tennis, it is now part of the decision process
 In some cases in cricket it is used to estimate the upcoming path of a ball
 It was developed in 2001 by engineers from Romsey's Roke Manor Research Ltd
, Hampshire, UK
 a patent was applied for in Britain by Dr
 Paul Hawkins and David Sherry, but then it was withdrawn
 Later, the technology went to a different company, hawk-eye Innovations Limited, a joint venture with television production company Sunset + Vine and was bought outright by Sony in March 2011

 In each frame sent from each camera, the system recognizes a group of pixels related to the ball's image
 After this the three-dimensional position of the ball is calculated for each frame based on images obtained at the same time from at least two different cameras
 After this, the path of motion of the ball is formed from the frames that come
 It also "predicts" the path of the ball's flight and also tells which object the ball will hit in the field of play already accumulated in the database
 This system can also tell about the violation of the rules of the game by studying these conflicts

 The net tracking system is connected to a back-end database and archiving capability to extract trends and statistics for a particular player, game, comparison of balls, etc

 On June 14, 2006, a group of investors bought the company, including Mark Getty, from a wealthy family and business house in the United States, inspired by the Wisden Group
 The acquisition was done to strengthen the Wisden Group's presence in cricket and to allow it to enter tennis and other international sports, while hawk-eye was working on implementing a system for basketball
 According to hawk-eye's website, the system generates much more data than content shown on television, which can be easily viewed on the Internet

 The technology was first used by Channel 4 on 21 May 2001 at the Lord's Cricket Ground in a Test match played between England and Pakistan
 It is primarily used by most television networks to determine the direction of the ball during flight
 In the winter season of 2008 / 2009, the ICC tested a referral system where hawk-eye was used to send a third umpire for consideration if a team disagreed with an lbw's decision
 The third umpire was able to see the ball hitting the batsman, but could not see the approximate direction of the ball after hitting it

 Due to its real-time coverage of bowling speed, these systems are also used to indicate the bowler's form of throwing the ball, including the ball's line and length or swing / turn
 At the end of an over, all six balls are shown together to reflect the changes made by the bowler, such as slow balls, bouncers and leg cutters, etc
 The complete record of a bowler can also be shown during a match

 Some decisions were expressed by William in a match that was defeated by Serena Williams' Jennifer Capriati at the 2004 US Open, with TV replays indicating that some of them were in fact wrong
 Although those decisions were not overturned, chief umpire Mariana Alves was dismissed from the tournament and the subsequent US Opens
 These errors led to a discussion about line calling assistance, especially as an auto-ref system, which was being tested by the US Open at the time and was found to be very correct

 The hawk-eye has been used in television broadcasts for several major tennis tournaments, including Wimbledon, Stella Artois in Queens, Australian Open, Davis Cup and Tennis Masters Cup
 The US Open Tennis Championship announced that they would make official use of this technology at the 2006 US Open in which each player would receive two challenges in each set
 It is also used in a large tennis simulation called Point Tracker, which is made by IBM

 hawk-eye technology was used at the 2007 Dubai Tennis Championships where some controversies arose
 Champion Rafael Nadal, who was trying to reclaim it, alleged that the system made a wrong decision and showed an out ball which caused him to be out of the game
 The umpire called the ball out; Mikhail Youzhny challenged this decision, according to hawk-eye it was 3 mm in
 Yuzhni later said that he himself thought that the mark could be wider but then due to the availability of technology such a mistake could be made by any line man and umpire
 Nadal just shrugged, he said that this system is wrong, it can be seen from the ball sign that this system is wrong
 The mark made of the ball on the hard court was part of the area the ball came into contact with

 In the fourth round of the 2009 Australian Open, during the match of Roger Federer and Thomas Bardike, Bardike challenged an out call
 At that time the hawk-eye system was not available due to a shadow on the court
 The actual decision was upheld as a result
 2009 main indian wales masters quarter final main evan lubikik evam endi mare ke bich match main, mare ne ek out kol ko chunauti di
 hoque-ai pranali ne sanket diya ki gend line ke kendra par ai, haalaanki prasaaran ko punah dekhne par yah spasht rup se dikh rahaa tha ki gend out thi

 match ke turant baad, mare ne kol ke liye lubikik se maafee maangi or sweekaar kiya he ki point out tha
 The hawk-eye system was originally developed as a replay system for coverage of TV broadcasts
 Originally in the beginning it could not give in or out call itself, only the auto-ref system was able to give line in / out call as it was designed for quick line calling only
 Both systems can produce replays

 As of March 2008, the International Tennis Federation), Association of Tennis Professionals), Women's Tennis Association), Grand Slam Committee, and many other individual tournaments were using conflicting rules on hawk-eye
 a prime example of this was the number of challenges a player would receive in each set, which was different in different competitions
 Some tournaments allowed a player more errors, players could challenge an unlimited number of times during a match
 In other tournaments, players received two or three challenges per set
 On 19 March 2008, the above mentioned entities announced standardized rules: three unsuccessful challenges per set, one additional challenge in the event of a tiebreak
 After standardization of rules, the next male and female tour was the 2008 Sony Ericsson Open, in which these rules were followed

 FIFA Secretary General Jerome Walke believes the hawk-eye goal-line technology will be implemented if its developers 100 percent guarantee success
 Football's governing bodies have in the past been reluctant to use video technology to settle pitch disputes
 The suitability of hawk-eye in football is expected to continue and can be tested in the Premier League according to Dr
 Paul Hawkins, the inventor of the system
 "we will talk to FIFA next week in detail, but i think it will be positive," says Hawkins

 In 2008, an article in a peer-reviewed journal collected many such doubts
 The authors acknowledged the importance of the system, but also stated that it is probably unreliable and that a range of error in accurate depiction makes the incidence of failure suspicious
 The authors also argued that the extent of its accuracy is not accepted by the players, officials, commentators or spectators, these are the people who consider it to be indisputable truth
 For example, he argued that the hawk-eye can feel the difficulty of predicting the curved path of a cricket ball: the time it takes the ball to reach the batsman is so short that it is difficult to generate three frames and Without it, the path of the ball cannot be accurately represented
 The article also argues that they have been ignored in the hawk-eye depiction of the line decision in tennis, Such as the deformity of the bounce of the ball and the imperfect precision by which the lines are painted on the court
 The makers of hawk-eye strongly denied these claims, but the authors did not take them back

 Organic farming is a method of agriculture that is based on the use or minimal use of synthesized fertilizers and synthesized pesticides and uses crop rotation, green manure, compost, etc
 to maintain the fertility of the soil
 san 1990 ke baad se vishwa main jaivik utpaadon kaa bazaar kaafii badha he
 Increasing population all over the world is a serious problem, with increasing population, the use of various types of chemical fertilizers, poisonous pesticides to get maximum production in the food production competition by humans affected the ecosystem

 In India, cow farming was practiced along with agriculture since time immemorial, the proof of which is Lord Krishna and Balarama in our texts, which we address as Gopal and Haldhar i

 Agriculture and Gopalan was jointly extremely beneficial
 The creature was very useful only for the environment

 bharat varsh main gramin arthvyavastha kaa mukhya aadhaar krishi he or krishakon kii mukhya aay kaa saadhan kheti he
 In view of the increasing population since the time of the Green Revolution, it is necessary to increase production from the point of view of income, for more production, more amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used in farming, due to which the marginal and small farmers have high cost in low holdings
 Looks and water, land, air and environment are also being polluted as well as food items are also becoming poisonous

 The use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture would have poisoned the crop

 The method of organic farming gives equal or more production than the method of chemical farming, that is, organic farming is absolutely helpful in increasing soil fertility and productivity of farmers
 varsha aadhaarit kshetron main jaivik kheti kii vidhi or bhi adhik laabhadaayak he
 By doing organic farming, the cost of production is not only low, but also the farmers brothers get more income and organic products are more competitive in the international market

 "agnipurana" main pratham baar nayak-nayika kaa vivechan shringaar ras ke alamban vibhaavon ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Later writers of Sanskrit and Hindi have extended the subject within the boundaries of Shringaaras, accepting the status of "agnipuran"
 in simaaon kaa, jinka atikaraman keval apwaad ke rup main kiya gaya he, is prakaar samajha ja saktaa he: Bharata has made four distinctions of the hero: dheerelit, dheerprantha, dheerodatta, dheerodhata
 ye bhed naatak ke nayak ke hai
 In addition to these, "agnipuran" mentions four more distinctions: sangatha, darshan, shash, dhrishta
 ye bhed spasht hi shringaar ras ke alamban vibhaav ke hai
 Bhoj has mentioned several other classifications in addition to these two in "saraswati Kantabharan" and "shringarprakash"
 kintu unamem se keval ek vargeekaran hi, jiskaa ullekh purush ke bhedon ke rup main bharat ne bhi kiya tha, parvarti lekhakon ko maanya hua : uttam, madhyam, adham

 Only a few writers in Hindi have accepted the exquisite, medium, unbearable distinction of the hero, among whom Sundar, Cannon and Rasleen are prominent

 hajaari prasad ek kanjus or laalchee kism kaa aadmi he jo din raat apane iklaute putr raja, ke liye kisi dhani ladki kaa sapana dekhtaa rahata he
 Raja is only interested in spending his father's money in expensive parties
 ek din college jate vakt, nikat se guzar rahi ek jeep raja par keechad oochaal jaati he
 Madhu, the jeep girl, is rude to the king
 raja andha hone kaa dhong kar madhu ko bevakoof banaata he
 When reality opens, it imitates it
 donon iske saath hi ek duusare ke dushman ban jate hai or ek duusare ko majaa chakhaane kaa bahaanaa dhundne lagate hai
 The king drops Madhu with his effort during the dance rehearsal
 uske baad madhu usko college ke champion boxr se ladane ke liye majaboor kar detii he
 The king wins in that fist fight
 udhar ladki dhundte dhundte hajaari prasad ko abhas hota he kii uskaa raddi or kabad kaa dhandha raja kii bhavy shaadi main aade aayega
 One day while on a trip to an expensive hotel, he encounters Mr
 Mehra, a millionaire who has only one girl
 hajaari bhaade ke kalakaar lekar apane staff ke taur par bhartee kar letaa he
 Like Mehra, he too, with two big dogs, reaches the beach early in the morning where Mehra is roaming
 mehara ke saath saath ghumte hue wo bhikhaariyon ko bahut se nakli rupaye lutaata he
 He soon becomes Mehra's friend
 mehara or hajaari apane bacchon kii shaadi ek duusare se karne ko taiyaar ho jate hai
 When the king meets his future wife, he learns that the girl is Madhu
 madhu or raja shaadi kii sambhaavna se hi inkaar kar dete hai
 Madhu overcame a weekend college tour when he falsely accused Raja of trying to rape her
 raja krodhit hota he ki uski pratishtha barbaad ho gai he or use beyimaani or vichaarheenta ke liye dandit karata he, yah bataate hue ki kai log apana badla lete lekin vah alag he
 Madhu immediately falls in love with the king
 sagaai kii party main, shri mehara ko hajaari kii sachhee vittiya paristhitiyon ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Furious, he insults Hazari in front of everyone
 hajaari bahut zyada bura maanata he
 Raja and Madhu are refused by their parents to meet each other again
 phir bhi, donon gupt rup se milte rahete hai
 When Mr
 Mehra discovered this, he arranged for the king to be beaten by some thugs
 vah madhu ko dur bhejne kaa faisla karte hai jahaan vah raja se sampark nahin kar paaegi
 Before doing so, the king sneaks into Madhu's house and the two get married
 shri mehara ne madhu ko ghar se nikaal diya or ghoshit kiya ki vah unke liye mar chuki he
 Hazari also rejects the king when he finds out that he has married the daughter of his biggest enemy
 phir joda ek chote se jhopadi main chalaa jaataa he or raja ko ek nirmaan majdoor ke rup main kaam mil jaataa he
 Despite their poverty, they are happy
 nirmaan sthal par raja ko gambhir rup se chot lag jaati he
 Madhu begs her father for money to pay for the emergency operation
 hajaari sahamat ho jaataa he, lekin keval tabhi jab vah apane suhaag ko bhul jaae
 She removes her mangalsutra and returns to her father's house in despair
 jab raja thik ho jaataa he, to hajaari use bataata he ki madhu apane pita ke paas laut gai or aspataal main kabhi nahin ai or use marane ke liye chhod diya
 Assuming that Madhu has left him to return to a life of luxury, the king returns to his parents
 baad main, use apni maa se pataa chalaa ki madhu uske pita ke blackmel kii vajah se aspataal main nahin ai thi
 He rebuffs his father a lot and rushes to stop Madhu from flying to London
 lekin hawaii jahaaj pehle hi chalaa jaataa he
 His father realizes his mistake and fortunately he stops Madhu from taking the plane
 donon ke mata-pita kii sulah ho jaati he or sab khushhaal jivan paane main kaamyaab rahe
