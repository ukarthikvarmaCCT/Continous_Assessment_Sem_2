 In Sweden in the year 1713, King Charles XII appointed one of his councilors to punish officers who violated the law
 nayaa samvidhan banane par samvidhan sabha ke sadasyon ne isapar jor daalaa ki unka hi ek adhikari jaanch kaa kaary karegaa
 He cannot be a government official
 tab 1809 main sweden ke samvidhan main ambudsman kii vyavastha kii gai
 Hui, which will investigate cases of violation of laws and regulations by courts and public servants
 sweden main ambudsman ko raashtrapati dwaara chaar varsh ke liye namjad kiya jaataa he
 He is one of the best jurists and judges of the Supreme Court of the country
 prayek varsh sansad ke praarambhik satr main uskaa vaarshik prativedan prastut kiya jaataa he
 The Swedish government servants are not under ministerial control

 ambudsman doshi adhikariyon ke viruddh shikayaton kii jaanch karata he jo janata dwaara kii gai hoti he
 When satisfied, their case is sent to the courts for further proceedings
 sweden ke vipareet denmark main naukarshahon ke krity ke liye mantriparishad jimmedaar hoti rahi thi
 But under the Constitution of 1953 and the Ambudsman Act 1954, in Denmark also Ambudsmann was established in Sweden
 shuru main us pad par prasiddh nyayavid professor stephen harvitj ko niyukt kiya gaya
 The Ambudsmann of Denmark is appointed by Parliament after every general election
 sansad hi use hataane main samarth he
 The decisions of Denmark's Ambudsmann are not reconsidered in Parliament
 Ministers also come under the ambit of Ambudsaman
 denmark kaa ambudsman swayamev mukademe nahin chalaa saktaa jaisaa sweden main hota he
 He only orders the prosecuting officer to conduct the prosecution
 shashan ke viruddh pariwaadee naagarik ko vah mukadmaa chalaane kii salaah de saktaa he

 After the World War in Norway, citizens raised a mountain of complaints against officials and politicians
 1945 main norway kii sarkaar ne prashasnic prakriyaaon ke liye ek samiti niyukt kii
 It is interesting to know that this committee recommended in 1958 that the model of Denmark be accepted, following the ambush of Britain, America and European system
 The Ambudsmann law was enacted in Norway in 1968
 norway kii sansad ambudsman kaa nirvachan karti he
 He should be a superior jurist
 Its main duty is to see that there is no injustice to any citizen in public administration
 norway ke ambudman ko sweden kii tarah abhiyojan chalaane kaa adhikaar nahin hota or na hi vah denmark ke ambudsman kii tarah kisi adhikari ke viruddh abhiyojan chalaane ke aadesh de saktaa he
 He simply draws attention that a certain officer has made such a mistake and recommends that appropriate judicial action be taken against the guilty officer
 The judges and ministers are outside the ambit of the Norwegian Ambassador

 Jet propulsion or tachypropodation is the method of propulsion in which a jet of matter is used in the opposite direction of motion of the object to push the object forward
 isaki kriyavidhi newton ke gati ke tritiy niyam kaa par aadhaarit he
 It is a type of reaction propulsion ie it uses the power of reaction
 yah nodan praayah jet injanon main upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Similarly, jet propulsion is also most used for space vehicles
 bahut se jantuon main bhi jet nodan se aage badhane kii prakriya dekhi jaati he, jaise sheershapad, sandhipad praani, samudri khargosh, tathaa machhliyaan
 One of Newton's three famous laws is that every action has a reaction
 jaise mej ke upar yadi koi bhaar diya gaya he, to yah bhaar mej ko neeche kii ore dabaane kaa kaary kar rahaa he or kyonki mej is bhaar ko uthaa rahi he, isliye mej kaa dabaav upar kii ore he jiske kaaran bhaar uthaa hua he
 This upper pressure is called reaction and wherever an action is taking place, the reaction must be in some form or the other
 jab koi bandook chalaai jaati he to peeche kii ore dhakka lagata he
 If a ball is placed behind this gun, the ball can bounce and go very far due to this hit
 prayek mashin main kriya kii shakti ko hi kaam main laayaa jaataa he or pratikriya ko sahan karne kaa prabandh kiya jaataa he, jaise bandook main goli ko chalaaya jaataa he or uske kaaran dhakke ko sahan kiya jaataa he
 But the same reaction in tropes is taken that work that even good machines cannot do
 har prakaar kii motor gadiyon, hawaii tathaa pani ke jahaajon ke chalaane main piston injanon kaa upyog hota chalaa aayaa he
 Day by day new innovations were made in these engines and they started gaining more and more power
 in mashiinon kii or adhik teevr chaal kii maangon ne in injanon ke aakalpan ko yahan pahunch diya ki ab inaki or unnati sambhav nahin
 Also, due to this advancement, their machines became so entangled that it was difficult to make and use them
 isliye gas tarabine kaa upyog hua, jiske kaaran hawaii tathaa pani ke jahaajon kii gati atyadhik bad saki
 Now, tillering can be taken in two ways, one with gas turbine and the other using only Kship
 yadi is gas ke baahar nikalne kaa chhed chota ho to yah jor ke saath baahar niklegi, jisase gaadi ko dhakka lagegaa or vah aage kii ore chalane lagegi
 As the gas comes out loud, the speed of the car will also increase
 yadi gaadi halaki he or inamen gharshan nahin hota
 So its speed will be faster
 is gaadi ke is prakaar chalane kaa kaaran yahan kaha jaataa he ki yah gas chhed se baahar nikalati he to baahar kii hawa se takaraati he or isi kaaran gaadi aage bad jaati he, parantu vastusthiti yah nahin he
 If it is run at a place without air, then its speed will be more rapid
 isliye yah keval pratikriya hi he isko chalaati he
 In this way, this power is obtained due to the pressure of the retreating tube
 jahaan adhik chaal kii aavashyaktaa hui vahaan kshippranodan kaa upyog kiya gaya
 In fact, the practice of tricyclic will be successful only where more speed is required
 yudhkaal main samay kii bachat ke liye kship hawaii jahaaj kii unnati hui or udanevaale bamgolon main iskaa upyog hua
 The friction in ground machines is high
 or ve teevr gati se nahin chalaai ja saktin
 Therefore, trituration was not beneficial in them
 kshippranodan kii vaastavik unnati hawaii tathaa pani ke jahaajon main hui
 The light engines and rapid movement of such airplanes have reduced the time so much that it can be reached from one corner of the world to another in a very short time
 kshippranodan ke liye sabhi prakaar ke injanon ke nimitt ek hi niyam hai
 All the engines pull the outside air in themselves and the air and fuel are mixed inside it, where both are burnt
 is failaav ke kaaran mashin ko dhakka lagata he
 At the time of burning, fuel and air dissipate more and when the machine is running, the air mixture becomes more
 hawa tathaa inrdhan ke jalane se jo gas taiyaar hoti he usko adhik gati di jaati he
 The gas can gain more speed at the same time it is given the opportunity to spread properly
 parantu is failaav main gas kii daab ghat jaaygi, kyonki gas ko usee hawa main chhodana he jahaan se hawa ko eendhan ke saath milaane ke liye bheetar khinchaa gaya tha
 Therefore, full power will not be obtained by decreasing the pressure
 jab tak gas ke peeche puri daab nahin hogi, pranodan samarth na hoga
 Therefore, a compressive machine is arranged to get full pressure behind the gas
 is sampidak ko chalaane ke liye gas tarabine lagaaya jaataa he
 The compressor pulls the air out and throws it with full force towards the turbine
 tarabine tathaa sampidak ke bich eendhan ko isi hawa main mila diya jaataa he or is mishran ko jalane kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 By its burning, the volume and temperature increase at the same pressure
 yah shakti itani hoti he ki isse tarabine bhi chalaaya ja sake or kship ke liye bhi isamen puri gatij urja rah jaae
 The compressor pulls air to the combustion chamber, where the fuel is pre-ignited and this gas goes to the turbine at higher temperatures
 tarabine is gas se chalata he or yah tarabine sampidak ko bhi chalaata he
 This gas comes out of the turbine and exits at high pressure, spreading like a spur
 chalane ke samay yah tarabine duusare injanon se kam eendhan letaa he, parantu gati bad jane par yah sab injanon se kam eendhan letaa he
 Reaching a height, it consumes even less fuel
 is tarabine se chalanevaale hawaii jahaaj kii gati aavashyaktaanusaar nahin hoti
 For saving time and long journeys it is necessary that the weight of the airplane is reduced and the speed is high
 yadi hawaii jahaaj main keval kshippranodan hi ho, jisamen tarabine kaa upyog na ho to aisa ho saktaa he
 Many machines are not required in its machine
 is mashin ke keval teen bhaag he
 The first part is the front which has valves for air and the fuel hose through which the fuel is thrown from the pump
 in kapaaton ke samay par khulne se hawa bheetar jaati he
 These valves are closed when fuel and air burns to become gas
 eendhan ke jalane par dhadaaka hota he or gas baahar kii ore bhaagti he
 The second part is of the combustion chamber and the third part is of the drain behind the engine, the length of which is kept according to the power of the engine
 jab isko chalaanaa hota he to isamen sabase pehle eendhan chhidaka jaataa he or aag laga di jaati he
 At this time air valves open and the air comes in and mixes with the fuel
 milawat thik prakaar se kii jaati he
 The mixture of fuel and air burns in about 2 milliseconds and its temperature is 250 C
 And the pressure increases by 100 percent
 ab yah gas naalee kii ore jaati he to naalee main jane se pehle yah failati he
 When it goes into the drain, its temperature is 9000 c due to the diameter of the drain
 And the pressure decreases to 95 percent
 kothri se baahar nikalne tak kaa samay 8 milisecond ho saktaa he
 Thus the explosion caused by the mixture of fuel and air occurs quickly after each other
 isi dhadaake ke bal par or gas ke teevr gati se baahar nikalne ke kaaran pranodan ke liye mashin milti he
 The fuel is first burnt with electricity, but when the machine is running, the combustion chamber is so hot that the fuel burns on its own
 eendhan kii naalee kii lambaai itani rakhi jaati he ki hawa ke kapaat khulne se pehle hi jali hui gas baahar nikal jaae
 This type of machine was used in bombing you and is now used in airplanes, but it requires long space to run and must be high speed while running
 pehle yah vichaar tha ki piston ingine ke sthaan par kshippranodan kaa vyavhaar karne par bahut zyada kal purajon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi, parantu aisa nahin hua
 With the use of tarnishing, it was discovered that only fuel pumps have to be made very carefully and it is absolutely necessary to keep the fuel and air under control
 maan len gas nikalne kaa pariman m prati second he or isaki gati ga he
 The power running the machine was increased
 yadi gas ke baahar nikalne ke sthaan kaa kshetrafal ksha he to is sthaan par do daaben hongi, ek to baahar nikalanevaali gas kii daab jo ni1 he or duusari is sthaan par hawa kii daab, jo, maan len, ni2 he
 These two pressures will be against each other
 isliye is sthaan par daab hogi ksha jo m x ga ke saath kaam karegi
 Therefore the full power of propulsion will be = xx + q
 yadi gas baahar nikalanevaali chhed ko aisa banaaya jaae ki gas falkar daab ni2 tak aa jaae to ni1= ni2, isliye shakti =m x ga
 This is called Samirikana of Pranodaya
 pranodan kaa karyanupaat nimnaankit sameekaran se dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Where c is the speed of speed and the speed of running of machine
 yah karyanupaat mahattam hoga yadi ga=r, arthath mashin kii chaal yadi kship kii chaal ke baraabar ho

 is prakaar sangh ko dwitiya sarasanghachaalak kii prapti hui
 When Shri Guruji felt that this body would not be able to support him for a long time, he too consulted his fellow workers and by a letter declared Shri Balasaheb Deoras as the new Sarsanghchalak
 vah patr unke dehanth ke baad kholaa gaya tha
 Balasaheb assumed this responsibility after the death of Shri Guruji, this created a belief in the minds of the people that this responsibility is lifelong and the former Sarsanghchalak can give this responsibility to anyone as per his wish
 sangh virdohi ise ek gupt sanghathan to kehete hi the; par ab unhone ise aloktantric bhi maan liya
 Shri Balasaheb Deoras removed the method adopted by both of his former sarsanghchalaks and appointed a new sarsanghchalak
 unhone swasthya bahut kharaab hone par akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha main sab pratinidhiyon ke sammukh shri rajju bhaiya ko nayaa sarasanghachaalak ghoshit kiya
 Mother Rajju Bhaiyya and then Shri Sudarshan Ji also followed this method
 is prakaar sangh main ek nayi parampara viksit hui
 Look at this development from another point of view
 jab balasahab ne daayitv se mukti lee, tab unka swasthya bahut kharaab tha
 He could walk on a wheel chair
 munh main baar-baar thook bhar jaataa tha, at: bolne main bhi unako bahut kathinaayee hoti thi
 His written messages were heard in all programs
 apni dainik kriyaayein bhi ve kisi ke sahyog se hi kar pate the
 For this reason, everyone took their liberty freely
 duusari ore rajju bhaiya ne jab kaarybhaar choda, to ve purna swasth to nahin; par pravaas karne yogya the
 He also had difficulty speaking on stage in public; But they used to hold personal talks easily
 daayitv se mukt hokar bhi unhone anek praanton kaa pravaas kiya
 That is, if they wanted, they could fulfill this responsibility for two-three years
 But he left this job after finding a suitable person
 jahaan tak paanchave sarasanghachaalak shri sudarshan ji kii baat he, daayitv mukti tak ve kaaphi swasth the
 He had little difficulty speaking publicly as well as migration
 phir bhi jab unhen laga ki shri mohan bhagwat ke rup main ek suyogy evam urjavan kaaryakarta saamne he, to unhone bhi jimmedaari chhod di
 It is clear that he did what Adi Sarsanghchalak Dr
 Hedgewar said while accepting his office that whenever you get more qualified workers than me, you should make him Sarsanghchalak
 main unke nirdesh ke anusaar kaam karuunga
 This is the belief in one tradition and the development of another tradition
 puraani neenv par naye nirmaan kaa isse adhik sundar udhaaharan or kya hoga ? Think from another point of view
 poojya dow ji ke dehanth ke baad unka dah sanskaar reshim baag main hua
 Today his samadhi is built there, which is called 'smriti Mandir'
 uskaa bahya rup mandir jaisaa he; par vahaan puja, paath, ghanta, bhoga, aarti, prasad aadi kuch nahin he
 There is a grand statue of Doctor Ji, which is open from three sides
 spasht he sangh main vyakti kaa mahatv hote hue bhi vyakti puja ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 The second Sarsanghchalak Shri Guruji wrote three letters before his death
 duusare patr main hi unhone kah diya tha ki doctor ji kii tarah unka koi smarak na banaaen
 The workers cremated him in front of Smriti Mandir, honoring his wish
 aaj vahaan yajna jwaalaon ke rup main ek chota ‘smriti chinh’ bana he
 On it are inscribed the lines of Sant Tukaram, to which Mr
 Guruji, in quoting his third letter, apologized to all the volunteers
 shri balasahab devaras isse ek kadam or aage gayi
 He had already told the workers that we should not make Reshim Bagh the cremation ground of Sarsanghchalakas
 isliye meraa antim sanskaar saamaanya shmashaan ghat par kiya jaae
 Balasaheb died in Pune; But he spent a lot of his life in Nagpur
 unke anek mitra va sambandhi vahaan the, jo unke antim darshan kar shradhanjali dena chaahate the
 Hence, his body was brought to Nagpur and dedicated to Agni at Gangabai Ghat
 balasahab ke hi samaan rajju bhaiya kaa dehanth bhi pune main hua
 He once expressed a wish that there is no need to bring his dead body to Nagpur or Delhi
 jahaan unka dehanth ho, vahiin unka antim sanskaar kar diya jaae
 For this reason, he was cremated in Pune
 sudarshan ji kaa dehanth raipur main hua
 His body was brought to Nagpur
 sangh ke kuch kaaryakarta unke parthiv sharir ko ek rath se antim sanskaar ke liye reshmibagh se ganga bai ghat le gaye
 At some point the Sangh was accused of being Maratha and Brahminical; But after Prof
 Rajendra Singh of Uttar Pradesh and Sudarshan Ji of Karnataka became sarsanghchalak, these people got their faces stitched
 2009 main mohan bhagwat ke sarasanghachaalak or suresh joshi ke sarkarywah banane ke baad ye vitandavadi phir chillaaye; par ab kisi ne unhen ghaas nahin daali
 Everyone has understood that such allegations are nothing but nonsense
 jo log sangh ko lakeer kaa fakir yaa puraani paramparaon se chipta rahane vaala kupamandu sanghathan kehete hai, unhen sarasanghachaalak parampara ke vikaas kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The Sangh has not yet celebrated its centenary; But even after this, many changes have taken place in this tradition
 yah sangh kii jeevantta kaa pratik he or isi main sangh kii urja kaa rahasy chipa he

 Even today, on the way to Bhojpur, near the Shiv temple, a huge sail made of stones of that pond is seen

 It is said that Raja Bhoj had a skin disease when a sage or a Vaidya advised him to bathe and drink in the water of this pond, which cured his skin
 us vishaal talab ke pani se shivmandir main sthapit vishaal shivlinga kaa abhishek bhi kiya jaataa tha

 Parmar was very agitated after Munj died in a mourning situation and hence Parmar was inspired by the Bhoj Chalukyas to march south with the idea of revenge lane
 unhone ne daahal ke kalburi gangeyadev tathaa thanjore ke rajendra chol se sandhi kii ore saath hi saath dakshin par akraman bhi kar diya, parantu tatkaaleen raja chalukya jaisingh dwitiya ne bahaduree se saamana kiya or apana rajya bachaa liya
 Sometime after 1044 AD, Someshwar II, the son of Jai Singh again turned hostile to the Paramaras and attacked the Malwa kingdom and forced Bhoja to flee
 dharanagari par adhikaar kar lene ke baad usne aag laga di, parantu kuch hi dinon baad someshwar ne maalav chhod diya or bhoj ne rajdhani main lotakar phir sattadhikaar praapt kar liya

 Its capital was Pataliputra

 At that time, Magadha was quite powerful and pricked the eyes of its neighboring states
 par tatkaaleen magadh ke samraat ghananand ne usko thukraa diya
 He said that you are a pundit and take care of your peak "war is the king's job, you are a pundit, only do panditai"
 Since then Chanakya took a vow that he would teach Dhanananda a lesson
 maury pracheen kshatriya kabeeley ke hisse rahe he
 According to Greek sources such as Brahmin literature, Visakhadatta Mudrarakshas and Justin, etc
, there were no opinions of historians about the origin of Maurya
 Some scholars also believe that Chandragupta Maurya has originated from his mother Mura

 chandragupta usee gana pramukh kaa putr tha jo kii chandragupta ke bal avasthaa main hi yoddha ke rup main maaraa gaya
 Chandragupta had the natural qualities to become a king ', seeing this ability, Chanakya made him his disciple, and laid the foundation of a strong nation which is an ideal till date

 The discovery, which is very similar to these early fossil marks, has its origins in the present-day giant size single-organism Protista organism Gromia sphaerica, doubting their interpretation as evidence of early animal development
 lambey arase pehle se spanj ko anya praarambhik jantuon se bhinn mana jaataa tha
 As noted above, the complex organization found in most other associations is not found in them, their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into separate tissues

 anya sangho main, tinophora or nideria, jinamein samudri anemon, coral or jelifish shaamil hai, trigyat samamit hote hai, inamen ek hi chhidr se yukt pachan kaksh hota he, jo mukh or guda donon kaa kaam karata he
 Both have distinctly differentiated tissues, but are not organized into organs
 inamen keval do mukhya janan str hote hai, bahya tvak str or antah tvak str, jinke bich main keval koshikaayen bikhri hoti hai
 That is why these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
 chote placosoa samaan hai, lekin un main ek sthaayee pachan kaksh nahin hota he
 The remaining animals form a federal group called the bilateria
 adhiktam bhaag ke liye, ve dwiparshv samamit hote hai or aksar ek vishishtikrut sir hota he jo khaadya angon or samvedi angon se yukt hota he
 The body is tripleblastic, that is, all three reproductive layers are fully developed and tissues form differentiated organs
 pachan kaksh main do chhidr hote hai, ek mukh or ek guda, saath hi ek aantarik deh guha bhi hoti he jo ceylom yaa abhaasi deh guha bhi kehalaati he
 There are exceptions to each of these traits, however - adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and have very simplified physiological structures in typical parasitic animals
 anuvanshik adhyayan nen bailetria ke bheetar sambandh ko lekar hamaare gyaan ko kaaphi had tak badal diya he
 Most belong to two main genealogies: Deuterostomes and Protostomes, including Ecdysozoa, Platyzoa, and Lophotrochozoa
 is ke atirikt, dwiparshvasamamit jeevon ke kuch chote samooh hai jo in mukhya samoohon ke samaksh visarit hote hue prathit hote hai
 These include Aesolomorpha, Rhombozoa and Orthonectida
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mixojoa, ek koshikeey paraseete jinhen mul rup se protogon mana jaataa tha, bailetria se hi viksit hue hai
 Deuterostomes differ in many ways from other bilateria, protostomes
 donon hi maamalon main ek puraa pachan path paaya jaataa he
 However, in the protostome, the initial pore develops in the mouth and the anus develops separately
 duterostome main yah ulat he
 In most protostomes, cells normally fill in the inner part of the gastrula and form the middle reproductive level, this is called Schizosillus development, but in the deuterostome it is formed by the intracellular level of innervation, known as entrosylic pouching
 duterostome main adhar ke bajaay prishthiya tantrika rajju hota he or unke bhrun main bhinn prakaar kaa vidalan hota he
 All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are distinctly federal levels
 duterostome ke pramukh sangh hai, ekainodermanta or cordeta
 The former is radially symmetric and is particularly marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers
 duusare vaale main mukhya rup se kasheruki jeev hai jinamein ridh kii haddi pai jaati he
 These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
 inke atirikt duterostome main hemicordeta or ekon krimi bhi shaamil hai
 Although they are not currently found predominantly, significant fossil evidence relates to them
 chetognetha yaa tir krimi bhi duterostome ho sakate hai, lekin adhik haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan protostome ke saath inke saannnidhya ko darshaate hai
 Ecdysozoa are protostomes, which have been named on the basis of a characteristic characteristic of growth by moulting or release
 sabase bada jantu sangh, aarthropoda inase sambandh rakhata he, jisamen krimi, makadiyaan, kekade or unke nikat sambandhi shaamil hai
 The body is divided into segments and typically there are paired appendages
 do chote sangh onicofora or taradegrada, aarthropoda ke nikat sambandhi hai or inamen bhi unke samaan lakshan paae jate hai
 The nematoda or round worm comes in Ekadisozoa, the second largest animal association
 golkrimi aam taur par sookshm jeev hote hai or lagbhag har aise vaataavaran main utpann ho jate hai jahaan pani hota he
 There are many important parasites
 in se sambandhit chote sangh hai nimetamorpha yaa ashwarom krimi or kinorehinka, priyapulida or loriciphera
 These groups have a truncated body, which is called virtual body cavity
 protostome ke shesh do samooh kabhi kabhi spirila ke saath rakhe jate hai, kyonki donon main bhrun kaa vikaas sarpil vidalan se hota he
 Platyzoa include the association Platyhelminthes, the flattened worm
 mul rup se inhen sabase aadim prakaar ke dwiparshvi mana jaataa tha, lekin ab aisa mana jaataa he ki ve adhik jatil purvajon se viksit hue hai
 This group includes many parasites, such as the fluke and the lace worm
 chapate krimi aguhiy hote hai, inamen deh guha kaa abhaav hota he, jaisaa ki unke nikatatam sambandhi, sookshm jeev gestrotrica main hota he
 Other associations of Platyzoa consist mostly of microscopic and virtual celiac
 sabase pramukh hai rotiphera yaa rotiphers, jo jaleey vaataavaran main saamaanya hai
