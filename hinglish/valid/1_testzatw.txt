 The Iridium satellite group also uses a polar orbit to provide telecommunications services
 The disadvantage for this orbit is that there is not a single place on the surface of the Earth from which the satellite of this polar orbit can be continuously contacted

 For satellites passing directly above the poles, this will not happen
 But due to the equatorial bulge of the Earth, the inclined orbit at a slight angle causes the ion to fall under thrust, it is revealed that an angle of about 8 degrees from the pole produces the desired ion in a 100-minute orbit

 At some work, Miss Pross is surprised to see her missing brother, Salomon Pross, but Pross does not want her to be recognized
 Suddenly Sydney Carton appears and identifies the Solomon Pross as John Barsad, one of the men who tried to implicate Darnay for treason in the first trial in London
 carton dhamkee detaa he ki vah solaaman kii shinaakht apni suvidhanusaar frans yaa britain ke liye jasusi karne vaale ek angrez or mauqaaprast ke rup main kar degaa

 carton ko pataa chalata he ki madam difaarge us kisaan parivaar kii jivit bachi bahan thi jise evermmond parivaar ne nasht kiya tha
 The only information in the plot that could generate any sympathy for Madame Defarge is that her family has been lost and that she has no name
 "difaarge" uski shaadi ke baad kaa naam he or dow manet ko uske parivaar kaa naam nahin pataa chal paata yadhyapi vah uski mar rahi bahan se poochta he

 aisa vah lusi ke pyaar kii khatir, use pehle die gaye apane vaade ko yaad karke karata he
 Following Carton's first instructions, Darnay's family and Laurie flee Paris and France with an unconscious man in the park holding Carton's identity card but actually Darnay

 The novel concludes with guillotining Sydney Carton
 carton ke antim vichaar bhavishyavaanee karte hai: carton ko dikhaai de jaataa he ki difaarge, barsaad or da vengence sahit kai krantikariyon ko khud ko gilotin karne ke liye bheja jayega or ki daarne or lusi kaa ek betaa hoga jiskaa naam ve carton ke naam par rakhenge: betaa jo ki carton dwaara adhure chode gaye sabhi vaade puraa karegaa
 Lucy and Darnay's first son is born at the beginning of the book and dies within the same paragraph

 —final sentence of a tale of two cities i tail of tu citis charles dicens ke maatr do aitihaasik upanyaason main se ek he 
 It has fewer characters and subtitles than a typical novel by Charles Dickens
 lekhak kaa praathmik aitihaasik strothathhe French Revolution: a History thomas karlile dwaara tha: tail kii prastaavna main charles dicens ne likhaa ki "koi shri karlile kii adbhut pustak ke darshan main kuch bhi jodne kii aashaa nahin kar saktaa" karlile kaa vichaar ki itihaas vinaash or punerjeevan ke chakra se guzarataa he, ne upanyaas par mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa, sidney carton ke jivan or mrityu dwaara vishesh rup se acchhee tarah se chitrit kiya gaya he
 Dickens uses a literal translation of French idioms for characters unable to speak English such as, "what do you do in that galley? !!" or "mere pati kahaan he? --- yahan aap mujhe dekhte hai
 "the Penguin Classics edition of the novel notes that" not all readers have considered the experiment a success
 " Dickens is noted for his humor but a Tale of Two Cities is his least comical book
 baharhaal, jeri crunchar, miss pros or shri striver kamedi pradaan karte hai
 Dickens uses satire as a comic to illustrate a variety of perspectives
 pustak dukhad paristhitiyon se bhari he isliye isamen dicens ke hasya ke liye zyaada jagah nahin he
 = dicens ke england main, punerjeevan nishchit rup se sadaiv ek isai sandarbh main hota he
 Broadly, Sydney Carton's soul is revived at the end of the novel or adhik saakaar rup se, "pehali pustak" dow manet kii qaid main jivit maut se lekar punarjanm se sambandhit he
 Resurrection first appears when Mr
 Laurie answers Jerry Cruncher's message with the words "return to Life"
 shri lorie kii dover ko buggy kii sawari ke dauraan bhi punerjeevan prakat hota he, jab vah lagaataar dow manet ke saath pariklpit baatcheet par manan karata he: unka maananaa he ki vah dow manet kii punerjeevit hone main madad kar rahe hai or vah kalpana karte hai ki vah khud "khudaai" karke dow manet ko kabr se nikaal rahe hai
 Resurrection is the main theme of the novel
 punerjeevan ko ek vishay-vastu ke rup main pehle pahal dow manet ke bare main jarvis lorie ke vichaaron main dekha jaataa he
 This is also the final theme: the sacrifice of the carton
 Dickens originally wanted to rename the entire novel as Reclaimed to Life
 jeri bhi is aavarti vishay-vastu kaa hissaa he: vah swany mrityu or punerjeevan main is tareeke se shaamil he ki pathak ko abhi tak pataa nahin chalata
 iskaa pehla purvabhaas uski apane liye kii gai tippanee main miltaa he: "jeri, agar jivan ko vaapasi kaa fishan chal niklaa to tumhaari to chaandi ho jaaegi!" is bayaan kaa malin hasya bahut baad main spasht hota he
 Five years later, on a dark and cloudy night, Mr
 Laurie recreates the reader's interest in the mystique by telling Jerry that "this is the night of 


 many more 


 to bring the dead out of the grave
" jeri dridhtaa se jawaab detaa he ki usne raat ko kabhi aisa karte nahin dekha he
 It is revealed that Jerry Cruncher's involvement with the subject of resuscitation is that he is called a "revivalist" in the Victorian language, one who digs up dead bodies to sell to medical practitioners
 nihsandeh, punerjeevan kaa vilom mrityu he
 Death and resurrection often appear in the novel
 dicens is baat se rusht hai ki frans or england main adaalatein tuchh aparaadhon ke liye maut kii sazaa de detii hai
 In France, at the instigation of an aristocrat, farmers are executed to death without any trial
 markis saharsha daarne se kahata he ki "agle kamare main, ek aadmi ko


 uski beti se kisi swaadisht bhojan ke bare main gustaakhee se baat karne ke liye - uski beti ke sammaan main sthal par hi chura bhonk diya gaya tha
 " maze kii baat he, miss pros or shri lorie dwaara dow manet ke juuta banane vaale bench ko nasht kiye jane ko "sharir jalaane" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 It seems clear that this is a rare case where death or destruction has a positive meaning because "burning" helps the doctor free him from the memory of his long imprisonment
 lekin dayaalu or aupchaarik kaary kaa is tarah dicens kaa varnan bahut is peculiar: sachche man ko vinaash or gopneeyataitani khalati he ki apana kaam karte hue or iske nishaan mitaane main lage shri lorie or miss pros ko aisa mahasoos hota he or ve aise prathit hote hai maano kisi aparaadh main sanlipt hon
 The martyrdom of Sidney Carton frees her from all her wrongdoings in the past
 apane jivan ke antim kuch dinon ke dauraan messiah ke raahat dene vaale shabdon, "main punerjeevan or jivan hoon" ko doharaate hue vah bhagwaan ko bhi dhoondta he
 Resurrection is the main theme of the novel's final part
 daarne ko antim kshan main bachaa liya jaataa he or jivan ke liye waapas bula liya jaataa he, carton apane jivan se behatar jivan ke sthaan par maut or punerjeevan ko chunata he: "vah behad shant aadmi kaa cheharaa tha

" This symbolism appeals to Dickens's novel: a Tale of Two Cities often depicts the rising anger of the peasant horde, an indignation to which Dickens is somewhat sympathetic but ultimately irrational and animalistic

 " bheed kii ek samudr ke rup main kalpana kii gai he
 "with a roar that sounds as if all of France's breath has taken the form of a disgusting word, the living sea wave upon wave, depths of depths deepen and submerge the city
 

" Darnay's jailer is described as "a man with a puffy face and body that is drowned and filled with water"
 baad main, aatank ke shasankaal ke dauraan, kranti "itnaa adhik utpaati or vichlit ho gai

 " miss pros ke saath ladaai ke dauraan madam difaarge uske saath is tarah chipak jaati he jo "ek duubati hui mahila kii pakad se adhik" he
 Commentators on the novel have noted the irony that Madame Defarge is killed by her own gun, and perhaps Dickens from the above statement indicates that a sense of vicious vengeance like Madame Defarge would eventually destroy her predators as well
 anek ne upanyaas ko frid kii roshni main padhaa ahm or ahm

 If so, in such works he would get a glimpse of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr
 Jekyll and Mr
 Hyde
 daarne yogya or sammanjanak lekin ubaau he, carton badnaam he lekin aakarshak he

 Timothy syndrome is a rare self-mutually effective disease with symptoms such as physical malformations, tantric and developmental disorders such as QT enlargement of the heart, heart arrhythmia, structural heart defects, concomitant and autoimmune disorders
 timothy syndrome aksar akaal mrityu kaa kaaran banataa he
 The most surprising sign of Timothy syndrome is that concomitant syndactyly] -alteration occurs simultaneously in the same patient
 timothy syndrome ke anya saamaanya lakshan hai hriday sambandhi atalata, hryday kurachana evam swa-parayanata yaa swa-parayantik spekatroom vikaar 
 lagbhag aadhe marijon main chehre kii dismofolaujiyaan, jaise kii chapati naak, ke bhi lakshan hote hai
 Small teeth are found in children suffering from this disorder, who become cavities in the teeth due to a very weak layer of dentin, which makes it necessary to uproot teeth
 in lakshanon kii jatiltaaon ke kaaran mrityu ausat: 2
5 varshon main ho jaati he
 The symptoms of irregular timothy syndrome are mainly similar
 aniyamit form main antar ke taur par yuktangulita kii kami, peshikankaleey kii upastithi or alind vikampan hote hai
 People with irregular timothy syndrome mostly have facial disorders, such as the bulging forehead and tongue
 antat aniyamit timothy syndrome se peedit vyakti ke sharir kaa asmaan vikaas hota he jisame uske sharir kaa upari hissaa saamaanya rup se viksit hota he jabaki uske sharir kaa nichalaa bhaag ek 2 yaa 3 varshiya kii bhaanti hota he
 Children with Timothy syndrome are often born via caesarean section due to fetal afflictions
 yuktangulita or anya vikaar aam taur par janm ke vakt parakhe evam nidanit kiye jate hai
 Long QT syndrome can also sometimes be caused by a complication of surgery to prevent eutectasia
 anya baar, bachche khelte vaqt anayas hi besudh hokar gir jate hai
 It is possible to confirm all cases by ECG measurement
 CACNA1C jin kaa anukraman, nidaan kii atirikt pushti kar detaa he
 There are two recognized types of Timothy syndrome, classical and irregular
 Both of these are caused by mutations in the CACNA1C gene
 timothy syndrome ke kaaran hui muteshan channel ke band hone main vilamb paidaa karti he or is prakaar koshikeey uttejnaa badhaati he
 Both classical and irregular Timothy syndrome are caused by mutations in CACNA1C
 ye muteshan exon 8 or exon 8a, ek anya jin yugmanit exon, main hote hai
 Exon 8A is best expressed in the heart, brain, gastrointestinal system, lungs, immune system and smooth muscle
 exon 8 bhi in jagahon par vyakt kiya gaya hota he or iskaa str exon 8A kii tulana main 5 guna adhik hota he
 In patients with classical Cck syndrome, a mutation called G406R is located slightly behind the sixth membrane, which is the length of the segment of domain 1
 is sthaan par sangrakshit glysin sucharu voltage nirbhar niskriyata ke liye ahm lagati he, kyonki mutent is vibhaag main aksham he
 Such are the mutations of irregular Timothy syndrome; One is the exact same G406R mutation that occurs in the second gene pair, and the other is the G402S mutation in some amino acid upstream
 The effect of these mutations on channel functions is similar to the effect of G406R mutations on classical timothy syndrome
 in mutenton main sucharu voltage nirbhar niskriyata kii kami cardiyak ection potential ke dauraan andar aati hui lambi curent or vidhruvan paidaa karti he
 This results in prolonged QT syndrome and consequently arrhythmia
 chuki exon 8 kii abhivyakti hryday main exon 8A kii tulana main kaaphi adhik hoti he, aniyamit timothy syndrome ke mariz ke hryday rog shastreey timothy syndrome ke marijon kii tulana main kaaphi khatarnaak hote hai
 Surgery usually treats structural heart defects and eutectomy
 propenonol yaa beta-adrinergik avarohak doctoron dwaara aksar nirdhaarit kiye jate hai tathaa hryday ke sucharu taal ko barqaraar rakhane ke liye gatiprerakon kaa nivesh bhi nirdeshit kiya jaataa he
 Mutations of stunted Timothy syndrome indicate defects in their calcium current, suggesting that calcium channel blockers may prove to be very effective as therapeutic agents
 timothy syndrome se peedit marijon kaa purvanumaan kaaphi aviksit he
 In a study conducted on 17 children, an average of 10 children died at the age of 2

 One patient of the asthmatic Timothy syndrome was predominantly luggage
 isi tarah, timothy syndrome se peedit marijon ke ek jode kii maa ko bhi muteshan tha, par usamen bhi kisi spasht phinotip kii kami thi
 However, in both these cases, the severity of the disorder was due to lack of mosaicism
 inamen se kuch asaamanyataayen 1990 ke dashak main varnit kii gayi thim
 However, in 2004 these calcium channels were linked to abnormalities, so it was named "timothy Syndrome", in honor of Dr

 The power and sovereignty of the king, the state and the umbrella, and the punishment given to an offender for his crime is called punishment
 ek duusare sandarbh main, raajnneetishastra ke chaar upayon - sam, daam, dand or bhed main ek upaay
 The literal meaning of punishment is 'stick' by which one is beaten
 sanskaragat kshetra main mukhya rup se brahmacharee vidhyaarthee ke dwaara dhaaran kiye janevaale dand kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 Detailed descriptions of it are found in the Grihyasutras, Smriti, their commentaries, Vrhat Samhita and other texts of theology generally
 tadnusaar brahman, kshatriya or vaisya balak bhinn bhinn avasthaaon main jab acharya ke dwaara yajyavidhi se upanayan sanskaar se sanskrit hote hai to unhen saumyadarshan or anudvegkar dand bhi dhaaran karne hote hai
 The scriptural laws and traditional beliefs are that a Brahmin child should bear the punishment of Vilvandand, Kshatriya child, Lalapataryant Palashdand and Vaisyabalak Nasikaparyant Udumbar
 dand shabd kaa mukhya rup se prayog raajnneetishastra or prashasan ke sambandh main kiya jaataa he
 The punishment by which criminals are punished is the same, but it is used within the limits of state and government
 jab rajya kii seemaa ke baahar kisi, shatru, mitra, madhyasth athwa udasin rajya ke prati uskaa prayog kiya jaay to vah raajnneeti ke chaar upayon main ek ho jaataa he or usase taatpary hota he sainya prayog kaa
 The scripture that deals with the consideration of these things is penal and its policy is punishment
 dandniti sarkaar or prashasan kaa vigyaan he, jiskaa aadhaar he naitikta or vidhi kaa paalan, jo dand dhaaran karanevaale tathaa dand paanevaale donon hi par samaan rup se lagu hoti he
 Folk tour is not possible without him
 
 According to the definition of Kamandaka Nitisara and Mahabharata, suppression of crimes is called punishment or "policy"
 is kaary ko karanevaala arthath is gun kaa pratik raja 'dandi' kehalaata he, nayan ke kaaran
 Shankaracharya has quoted Manusmriti while commenting on Kamandaka, where it has been said that the enjoyment of the world is possible only due to the fear of total public punishment
 spasht he, bhartiya raajnneetishastra main dand kaa atyadhik mahatv tha jo vaastavik or pratikatmak, donon swaroopon se vyakt hota tha
 Many things have been said in Manusmriti about punishment
 manu kehete hai ki jo dand he vahi raja, vahi nyaay kaa prachaarkartta or sab kaa shashankartta, vahi chaar varna or ashramon ke dharm kaa pratibhu arthath jamin he
 The same king and the ruler of the subject, the protector of all subjects, awakens among the sleeping people, that's why intelligent people call punishment as religion
 yadi raja dand ko achche prakaar vichaar se dhaaran kare to vah sab praja ko anandit kar detaa he or jo vina vichaare chalaaya jaay to sab ore se raja kaa vinaash kar detaa he
 All the characters of the punishment without punishment, ie the subjects are corrupted and all dignity becomes discolored
 dand ke yathavat na hone se sab logon kaa raja va rajya vyavastha ke viruddh prakope ho saktaa he
 It is also said that the punishment is very bright, which the unbeliever and godless cannot bear
 tab aisi sthiti main vah dand dharm se rahit raja va uske kutumb kaa hi naash kar detaa he
 It has also been said that a king who is devoid of education, obsessed and foolish in subjects, can never be able to punish with justice
 dand kii utpatti rajyasanstha kii utpatti ke saath hui
 In the Manusmriti and Mahabharata it has been said that the initial condition of mankind was of very pious nature, faultless deeds, virtue and seasons, when there was neither the position of a king, nor the kingdom, nor the punishment, nor the punishment and all the people
 They used to protect each other through religion
 kintu kalantar main tamasgunon kaa prabalya badhane laga, manushya samaaj apni aadim satv prakruti se chyut ho gaya or matsay nyaay chaa gaya
 The powerful started eating the weak
 aisi sthiti main rajya or raja kii utpatti hui or sabko sahi raaston par rakhane ke liye dand kaa vidhaan hua
 Punishment became a symbol of state power, which was the ruler, protector of all the subjects and awakened to sleep
 at: dand ko hi dharm sweekaar kiya gaya 
 It seems clear from this that the seeker of religion was considered as punishment only
 vah dharm jisamen arth or kaam bhi samahit he arthath dand trivarg kaa sadhak sweekrut hua
 Punishment was required to remove ejaculation from the norm
 rajya kii shakti ke rup main dand nyaayik kshetra main prasaarit hone laga
 Its purpose was to protect the beliefs and status quo of society and religion
 vah yathasthiti dharm ke naam se abhihit thi or dharm ke bhi varna, jati, ashram, desh, kaal, samooh, varg, parivaar or vyavsaay aadi bhedon par aadhaarit or bhinn bhinn roopon main maanya anek prakaar the, jinka gyaan dharmasanasth dandakartta ke liye atyaavashyak hota tha
 The king who used punishment also used to be punished if he violated religion
 dharm arthath vidhi se pare koi na tha dharm raajaaon kaa bhi raja tha
 The head of the state or any other power, such as the head of the republic, was the head of the judicial organization, but he could never be the head of the law, and the punishment would be on him for violating the law
 bharat main vidhi or dand kii yah samprabhutaa brahmankaal se lekar manusmriti or mahabharat ke yug ke bich viksit hui dikhaai detii he
 Modern jurisprudence believes four principles of punishment - sabhi deshon main samaaj kii atyant praarambhik avasthaa pratikaratmak dand kii thi, jisamen aankh ke badale aankh or daant ke badale daant kaa siddhant chalata tha
 Nouns like "biography" of Vedic literature indicate that the justice of the very early period of Indian history was harsh and symbolic
 is siddhanth kii manyata he ki ek apradhi ko kathor dand dene se duusare log aparaadh karne se darate hai
 The prohibitive principle holds that by punishing the offender, the person who has committed the crime gets his 'revenge'
 yah sabhi siddhanton main sabase bura siddhanth he kyonki isamen samaaj kaa kalyaan yaa samaaj kii suraksha kii bhaavana nahin he
 In the third stage the form of punishment became obstructive instead of symbolic
 iskaa kaaran tha doshi manushya ke prati dosha kiye gaye hue manushya kaa nipat lene ke bajaay dand dhaaran karanevaale rajya kaa bich main aa janaa
 Establishing the glory of state punishment by ending the spirit of personal revenge became a sign of the state's purpose and its growing power
 divaani ke maamalon main arthdand aadi dwaara dosha kiye gaye hue vyakti ko kuch badla dilaanaa yadhyapi vaid mana gaya, faujadaari ke maamalon main badla lenaa ab asambhav tha
 But harsh - at times it was often a rule to give extremely cruel and rude punishments
 yadi ham upanishdon ke daivadandon, baudhdhagranthon main varnit dandon, arthshaastra ke dwaara haath paanv kaat liye jane kii anushansaaon tathaa megesthnij dwaara kii janevaali uski sampushtiyon ko dekhen athwa purv or pashchim donon hi ore prachlit madhyakaalin or kuch had tak aadhunik kaal ke prarambh tak ke dandon kaa vivechan karen to yah kahana hoga ki ve atyant hi krur or aadhunik drushti se barbar the
 Their aim was to instill fear in others to commit crimes
 inamen ang-bhang, jivit jala diya janaa, mrityudand, aaajeevan karawas or asay yaatnaaon se bhare hue dand hote hai
 Preventive punishments include a measure to restrain the cause of the crime or his future doer, which is accomplished by taking away his personal freedom
 bharatvarsh kaa nirodhak jail vidhaan isi shrenee main he
 The fourth and best type of punishment is corrective
 sabhyataa ke vikaas ke kram main bhi yadhyapi sabhi deshon main sambhavit doshiyon ke prati dosha ke gambhir parinaam or dandyatnaaon kaa bhay upasthit karne ke liy kathor avarohak dand die jate rahe hai, par kabhi-kabhi sudharatmak pravritiyaan bhi uthati rahi hai
 In ancient Rome, the loss of the freedom of the guilty was considered the greatest punishment, and no torture was considered necessary thereafter
 bharatvarsh main kautilya ne karagraston ko praayshchitt karaane or apane paapon kaa bodh karaane kii vyavastha ke dwaara unhen vishuddh karaane kaa ullekh kiya he
 Ashoka, in his fourth column, has also ordered to reduce the punishments of the pure-witted, virtuous and good-natured convicts with behavior and punishments
 ye baaten dand vidhaan kii sudharatmak pravriti kii dyotak hai
 Memories include discussions of dhigdand or wagdand, which always preceded the judgments and slaughter
 uskaa taatpary yah tha ki saamaajik ninda maatr se yadi kaam chal jaay to kathor yaatnaaon kii aavashyaktaayen hi kya ? ek niyam to sarvamaanya tha or vah yah ki dand "yathaahe" ho or vah aaptdosh hone par hi diya janaa chahie
 In the 20th century, efforts are being made to give corrective form to the penal law
 1872 i main landan main ek antarrashtriya jail sudhaar or dandvidhaan ke kisi antarrashtriya swaroop ko nishchit karne ke liye sabha hui
 Later on, collective associations were also established, but its members remained mostly European countries
 dhire dhire kathor dandon ke sthaan par karagrast doshi ke naitik jivan kaa punarujjiwan lakshya mana jane laga
 There is hope more than fear
 dand ke sudharatmak siddhant main uskaa vidhaan doshi kii avasthaa, saamaajik vaataavaran or sthitivishesh ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Society and environment are also considered responsible for defects
 at: doshi ko sudhaarney ke liye manovaigyanik upayon kaa prayog, uskaa vaiyaktik str par vichaar, doshi baalkon ke liy sudharbhawanon kii vyavastha, audyogic shiksha, saadhaaran shiksha, naitik or dharmik vyaakhyaan or anya suniyojit vyavasthaayen kii jaati hai
 Like in some other countries in India too, efforts are on to make jobs and labor in dams, roads or other constructions that bind the prisoners, or to make social utility and family service through industrial education
 asambhav nahin ki kuch sadiyon main vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa apharan maatr sabase bada dand mana jaay or maanav swabhaav itnaa udaatt or pavitra ho jaye ki pranaharan or aaajeevan kathor karawas jaise dandon kii aavashyaktaa hi na rahe
 The Kabul River is a 700 km long river that merges into the Indus River near the city of Attock, Pakistan, starting from the Sanglakh chain of Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan
 kabul nadi purvi afghanistan kii mukhya nadi he or iskaa jalsambhar helmand nadi ke jalsambhar kshetra se unai darre dwaara vibhajit he
 It passes through the cities of Kabul, Chaharbagh and Jalalabad in Afghanistan, crossing the border 25 km north of Torkham and entering Pakistan
 afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul or uske ird-gird ke kabul praant kaa naam isi nadi par padaa he

 jalalabad main kunar nadi kaa kabul nadi se sangam hota he
 Although the Kuner water is more than the Kabul river, from here onwards, this mixed river is called the Kabul river because the cultural, historical and political importance of 'kabul' is more
 kabul nadi par kai band bane hue hai
 These include the Naglu dam in Kabul province, the Darunta dam in Nangarhar province and the Sarobi dam located east of Kabul city

 The Kabul River is mentioned at many places in history
 sanskrit or pracheen avastai bhashaa main is nadi ko 'kubha' bulaayaa jaataa tha jo aage chalakar 'kabul' main parivartit ho gaya
 The source of this word 'kubha' is not known correctly, but according to 19th century British historian Alexander Cunningham, it came from the word 'ku' in the Scythic language, which meant 'water'
 is vishay main kaha gaya he ki - The ancient Greek historian Arian had named the river Kabul as 'kofen' in his historiography titled 'alexander the Great's Expedition and the History of the Occupy over Iran'
 iske aadhaar par anya europea lekhakon ne is nadi ko 'connes' naam se bhi bulaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 The Arab writer Al Beruni called the Kabul River the 'river of Gorwand'

 There are many ancient temples and pilgrimage sites in this area too
 kumaanun kshetra main kai upbhashaain boli jaati hai
 Some of the main local languages are as follows: - kumaanun shabd kii vyutpati ke sambadh main vibhinn mat prachlit rahe hai
 From the point of view of language, it seems appropriate that this word is originally Kurma in Sanskrit
 champavat ke sameep 2196 meter unchaa kanteshwar parvat he jiske sambadh main manyata he ki bhagwaan vishnu apane dwitiya avatar main is parvat par teen varsh tak rahe
 Since then, he came to be known as kurm-anchal in place of Mount Kanteshwar
 is parvat kii akruti bhi kacchap kii peeth jaisi jaan padati he
 Probably this is the reason why this region may have been named as Kurmanchal
 pehle shaayad kurm shabd prayog main aata hoga, kyonki kurm shabd kaa prayog sthaneey bhashaa main bahutayat se miltaa he
 One of the reasons that the word Kumun may be replaced in place of Kurm can also be that the dialect here is found to be more uplifting
 kaalaantar main saahitiyik granthon, tamrapatron main kumuun ke sthaan par kumu or uske baad kumaun shabd sweekrut hua
 The use of the word Kurmanchal is also found in Sanskrit texts
 pramanik aitihaasik tathyon ke abhaav main nishchit rup se kahana kathin he ki multah kumaun kshetra main kin-kin maanav jatiyon kaa prabhutv tha
 It is known from certain references available in Mahabharata, Purana and ancient Sanskrit literature that the caste, Kirat, Kinnar, Yaksha, Tangava, Kulind, Khas etc
 were inhabited here
 mahabharat ke van parv main madhya himalay kii upatyakaon main nivas karne vaali jatiyon ko kiraat, tangav tathaa kulint bataaya gaya he

 It has come to Dronaparva that the said mountainous castes took part in the battle of Mahabharata with stone weapons from Duryodhana and threw stones at Krishna's charioteer Satyaki, but they could not stand in front of Satyaki's slogans
 brahmpurana or vayupurana main madhya himalay main kiraat, kinnar, yaksha, gandharva, vidyadhar, naag, ityadi jatiyon ke astitv ke sanket uplabdh hote hai
 The Girimala described by the name of Kashy Parvat situated in Kosi in the Manas section of Skanda Purana has been considered as the hilly terrain of Almora - Kaushiki Shalmali Madhyay Punya: Kashyay Parvat

 Apart from the Yaksha caste, there are also signs of residence of the Naga caste in Kumaon in the Adi era
 pithauragarh jile ke berinag naamak sthaan main binaag / beninag kaa prasiddh mandir he
 There are many temples in Kumaon named after the serpents
 jaise dhulanag, kalinag, pinglanag, kharharinag, basuki naag, nagdev ityadi
 The existence of Yaksha and Naga castes in the primitive castes of Kumaon is based on conjectures, but in relation to the Kirat caste, some societies can be said on the basis of classical and anthropological evidence that in the prehistoric era, the land of kumaon-garhwal, Kirat, Mongol The Adi was the abode of the non-aryan castes, who were conquered by the non-vedic Aryans who came from the north-west side at a time

 Apart from the Kirat caste, the Bhotia caste living in Uttaranchal in the Himalayas was also dominated by the Kumaon region
 bhotiya shabd multah boat yaa bhot he
 Tibet is also called Bhot Desh or Bhutan and due to its belonging to that country, the residents there were called Bhotia
 bhotiyon kii bhashaa tibeti kahi gai
 It is closely related to Tibetan
 johaar daarma, bans tathaa chaudaans kii bhashaa main sthangat vibhed paae jate hai
 The influence of Kumaoni on the dialect of Bhotis is clearly reflected
 is aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aaryon ke aagaman se pehle yahan munda tathaa tibeti parivaar kii bhashaa bolne vaale log nivas karte rahe honge

 The monitor was successful for many years, but after the mid-1960s, local stations, especially in larger markets, were reluctant to run non-conforming network programs by breaking their established formats

 Prior to its acquisition by GE, NBC operated its radio division partly to meet the fcc-mandated need to move away from tradition and partly to distribute programs in the public interest
 westwood jaise vyavsaay sangh aise niyamon ke adheen nahin hote kyonki unke swaamitv main koi bhi aisa stesan nahin tha
 Thus the self-denial of NBC Radio - "america's First Network" by GE - marked the beginning of the end of the old broadcast era and the entry of a new, largely uncontrolled industry that we still see today

 However, despite heavy publicity by RCA, sales of television sets in New York during the 1939–1940 period were dismal, mainly due to the high cost of the set and the lack of regular compelling programs

 In 1951, NBC hired italian-american composer Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the music for the first time written for television; Menotti created a 45-minute period called Amal and the Night Visitors, both composed by music and sankitika lessons, about a handicapped cowboy boy who meets three intelligent men and when he sees his crutch newborn He gives it amazingly well when given to Christ
