 Attribute theory tries to describe different types of behavior and tendencies related to dominant personality
 yah shaayad netritv kaa pratham shaikshanik siddhant he
 Thomas Carlyle, we can call the precursor of trait theory
 jin logon ne apni pratibha, kaushal or shaareerik visheshtaon kaa prayog kar adhikaar praapt kiya he unka varnan yahan kiya gaya he
 Ronald Heffetz has tried to relate the history of society to the history of great men, looking at the tradition of the nineteenth century
 visheshta siddhant ke samarthakon ne netritv kii visheshtaon ko drushtipaat kiya or kaha ki kuch nishchit visheshtaon ke paalan karne se prabhaavshaalee netritv kaayam ho saktaa he
 Shelle Kirkpatrick and Edwin A
 Locke gave examples of trait theory
 ve tark karte hai ki "pramukh netaa main kuch or gun shaamil hai: drive, netritv prerana ;, eemaandaaree, akhandta, aatmavishvaas, sangyanatmak kshamta or vyapaar kii jaankaree se judaa he
 According to his research, "there is less clear evidence for charisma, creativity and modesty"
 haalanki visheshta siddhant ke liye ek sahaj gyaan yukt apil kii gayi he, in siddhanton ko sabit karne main anek kathinaayeeyaan utpann ho sakati he or ye vipaksheeyon ko baar baar is kii chunauti dete hai
 According to the most "strong" version of trait theory, "leadership characteristics" are innate and some people are "born leaders" with their psychological characteristics, with leadership characteristics
 is siddhant ke adhyayan se ham bataa sakate hai kinetritv vikasapahchaan karne ke saath-saath netritv gunon ko maapta he, sakasham netaaon ko aksham netaaon ke bich fark ko pahachaanata he or phir sakasham logon ko prashikshan detaa he
 In response to criticism of the trait approach, theorists have called leadership a set of behaviors, researching the behaviors of 'successful leaders', identifying their behavioral skills and their broad style of leadership
 david manklilland ne netritv pratibha ko siddhanton ke ek samooh ke rup main dekha he na ki ek prerak rup main
 unhone kaha ki safal netaaon ko adhikaar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, sambhddhata kam maatra main or ucch maatra main gatividhi nishedh kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati hai
 In 1939, Kurt Lewin, Ronald Lipitt and Ralph White did little work on leadership style and the impact of leadership performance
 shodhakartaaon ne gyaarah varshiya ladakon ke samooh par vibhinn prakaar ke kaary kshetron main unke pradarshan kaa moolyankan kiya
 In each group, the leader's influence, his judgments, his praise and criticism, three styles have been observed in the management of group actions: authoritarian democratic laissez-faire
 In politics, leaders always make decisions alone, demanding strict compliance with its orders
 And give orders for each step taken; Future steps were largely uncertain
 jaruri nahin he netaa har kaam main bhagidaar bane, par ve praayah kaam karne main alag hote he or saamanytah vyaktigat prashansa or kaam ke liye aalochana bhi pradaan karte hai
 Calling democratic work a collective decision process has been called a feature supported by leaders
 kaam khatam karne se pehle, netaa se, samuhik charchaaon se, takneekee salaah ke pariprekshya se laabh praapt kar sakate hai
 Members could collectively decide the division of labor according to their choice
 is sthiti main prashansa or aalochanavastunishth hai or vaastavik rup se kaam kiye bina, uddeshy kii purti kisi bhi sadsy dbaara hoti hai
 Non-interventionists have given freedom to the members in collective policy making without the involvement of the leader
 netaa shram vibhaajan main bhaag nahin lete hai, ve jab tak kaha nahin jaataa tab tak kaam main bhaag nahin lete or bahut kam stuti karte hai
 As a result, the democratic style was most preferred
 prabandhkeey grid namoona bhi vyavhaar siddhant par aadhaarit he
 This model was created by Robert Blake and Jane Mautone in 1964 based on five different leadership styles, based on the distraction people have for leaders and their distraction for goal attainment
 sthitijanya siddhant bhi netritv ke lakshan siddhant kii ek pratikriya ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 As Carlyle suggested, social scientists argued that history was more than the result of the intervention of great men
 harbart spencer kaa kahana tha ki vyakti samay kii upaj he
 This theory suggests that different circumstances show different characteristics
 siddhanton ke is samooh se, kisi bhi netaa kii koi ek ishtatam manovaigyanik ruparekha nahin hoti
is siddhant ke anusaar ek vyakti vastav main jab ek netaa ke rup main vyavhaar karata he, uskaa ek sabase bada kaaran us sthiti par nirbhar karata he jisamen vah kaary karata he
 " kuch siddhantkaron ne visheshta or sthitijanya drushtikon kaa vishleshan karnaa shuru kiya
 Based on the research of Lewin et al, it can be said that academics tried to generalize the descriptive method of leadership legislation, they described their three leadership styles and also identified the context in which they work
 This authoritarian leadership style, for example, approved in times of crisis, but could not win the hearts and hearts of its followers in day-to-day management
 The democratic leadership style is more consensus-driven under the necessary circumstances
 ahastkshep siddhant ko use praapt swatantrata ke kaaran saraahaa jaataa he
 Because the leader does not participate in this, that is why it is called a 'failure' in times of long standing and organizational problems
 is kaaran siddhantakaaron ne netritv style ko paristhitivash aakasmik kaha he or ise kabhi-kabhi aakasmik siddhant bhi kaha he
 Today, four main contingency leadership theories appear: Feudler Contingency, vroom-yetton Decision path-goal Theory and hersay-balanchard Situational Theory
 is feedler aakasmikta namoona main netaa kii prabhaavashiltaa ko mukhya mana jaataa he, isi kaaran fred fidler ne ise paristhitivash aakasmik siddhant kaha
 yah netritv style or sthitijanya anukool baatcheet ke parinaam se utpann hota he
 This theory tells us about two types of leaders: those who develop a good relationship with the people and complete the task, and those who consider it their main duty to complete the task
 According to Fiedler, an ideal leader Are not
 kaary unmukh netaa or rishta unmukh netaa donon bhi prabhavi ho sakate hai yadi unka netritv sthitivash ho
 jab vahaan ek achche netaa-sadasyeey rishta he, ek ucch sanrachit kaary he or ucch netaa kii sthiti main adhikaar he, to is sthiti ko ek "anukool sthiti" mana jaataa he
 Feidler believed that task-oriented leaders are effective in favorable and unfavorable conditions
 jabaki rishta unmukh netaa madhyavarti paristhitiyon main sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hai
 Viktor Vroom, in collaboration with Philip Yatton and later Arthur Jago, made a classification to describe leadership positions
 yah maanak nirnay sidwant main prayog kiya gaya, jahaan vah netritv style kii sthitiyon ke karkon se juda or jo yah bataata tha ki koun sa prastaav kis sthiti main upyogi hota he
 This proposal was infrequent because it agreed with the manager's views which depended on the different classes, their views and positions
 baad main yahi siddhant apaat sthiti siddhant kaha gaya
 The path-goal theory was developed by Robert House
 yah siddhant victor varoom kipratyaasha siddhant par aadhaarit tha
 And support are relevant to all environmental factors and follower characteristics
 isfidler aakasmikta siddhant main, path-lakshya siddhant ke vipareet chaar netritv vyavhaar taral hote hai, netaa sthiti or aavashyaktaanusaar kisi bhi siddhant kaa paalan kar sakate hai
 path-goal Theory will be called both Cossaplex Theory and Practical Leadership Theory because it depends on the circumstances and emphasizes the mutual behavior between the leader and the followers
 hersey or balaanchard dwaara prastaavit paristhiti netritv namoonay ne chaar netritv shaileyon or chaar anuyaayi-vikaas staron ko prastaavit kiya he
 For effectiveness, certainty of the sample, leadership style, follower-development must be matched perfectly
 is namoonay main, netritv kaa vyavhaar keval netaa ke lakshan hi nahin lekin anuyaayiyon kii visheshtaayen ban jaati hai
 There is a special and useful theory, useful for addressing specific leader behaviors that contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness
 yah siddhant yah tark detaa he ki netaa kaa mukhya kaam he ki samooh kii aavashyaktaa ke liye jo bhi jaruri he uskaa dhyaan rakhana, isliye ek netaa ne samooh kii prabhaavashiltaa or ekta ke liye hameshaa acha kaam kiya he
 
 Although functional leadership theory has been most often applied to team leadership, it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well
 kaaryaatmak netritv par sahitya saransh, jackaaro at al
, hkkman or walton, morgeson, clen, jeigrat, nite or jion ne gaur kiya ki netaa sanghathan kii prabhaavashiltaa ko badhaava ke pradarshan main paanch vyapak kaary karata he
 These tasks include: environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and training of half-masters, motivating others and participating actively in group functions
 vibhinn netritv vyavhaar in kaaryon ko suvidhajanak rup se karne kii ummid rakhte hai
 In early work the leader considers the behavior identification, Feishman, to consider his supervisors' behavior of subordinate employees in terms of two broad categories, and as the beginning of the structure
 isamen vichaar vyavhaar prabhavi sambandhon ko badhaava dena bhi shaamil hai
 Examples of such behavior are a display of concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others
 shuruaati sanrachana main netaa kii karrwai or vishesh rup se kaary siddhi kendrit he
 This may include role explanations, setting standards of performance, and accountability to those standards
 kararwahi netaa ke paas itane adhikaar hote hai ki vah apane dal ke pradarshan yaa apradarshan ke liye kuch vishesh kaary kar saktaa he or inaam yaa sazaa de saktaa he
 Gives the manager the opportunity to lead his group and his group agrees to follow his lead so that a set goal is met and they get something in return
 The leader is empowered to evaluate Be able to train your subordinate employees to do the right thing, at a time when productivity is below the desired level and reward effectiveness results You are given at the time of taking roopantaran netaa apane dal ko prabhavi or kushal hone ko prerit karata he
 Communication is the basis for achieving the goal until the group achieves the final intended result or goal
 This leader is mostly visible and uses a series of commands to get the job done
 roopantaran netaa badi vastuon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai, jo un logon kii dekhbhaal ke liye he jo unke ghere main rahete hai
 Leaders are always on the lookout for measures that can help the organization achieve the company's goal
 netritv vishesh rup se bhaawanaaon se purna prakriya he jo saamaajik prabhaav kii prakriya ko bhaawanaaon ke saath le chalati he
 
 In an organization, the mood of the leaders has some effect on the group
 in prabhaavon main teen staron ko varnit kiya ja saktaa he: Research into customer service found that the leader's positive mood improves group performance
 jabaki anya kshetron main ek or nishkarsh paaya gaya
 Apart from the mood of the leader, his behavior is a source of positive and negative emotions for other employees
 netaa aisi sthitiyon or ghatnaon ko banaata he jo bhaavnaatmak pratikriya ko janm detaa he
 The performance of some leaders at the time of inciting incidents with their employees is the result of those same impressive incidents
 netaa kaarysthal uttejit ghatnaon ko aakaar dete hai
 For example - give feedback, allocate work, distribute resources
 kyonki unki bhavatmak sthiti se karmchaaree ke vyavhaar or utpaadakta par sidhaa prabhaav padataa he, isi liye sanghathanaatmak netaaon ke bhaavnaatmak paristhiti ko jaananaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Emotional intelligence, ability to understand, handle the mood and emotions of oneself and others makes effective leadership effective in organizations

 cricket ke khel main wicket-keeper kshetrarakshan karne vaale dal kaa vah khilaadi he jo wicket yaa stamps ke peeche vartmaan main strike par maujuud ballebaaj ke peeche khadaa hota he
 Only the wicket-keeper is allowed to wear guards and gloves on his feet among the fielding squad members
 mukhya rup se yah ek visheshgy kii bhoomika he, haalaanki kabhi-kabhi use gendbaaji ke liye bhi kaha jaataa he, aisi sthiti main kshetrarakshan dal ke kisi anya sadsy ko kuch samay ke liye wicket keeper kii bhoomika nibhaani padati he
 The role of the keeper in the rules of cricket is governed by Rule 40
 keeper kaa pramukh kaam un gendon ko pakadana hota he, jo ballebaajon ke paas se guzar kar wicket ke peeche chali aati hai, lekin vah vibhinn tareekon se ballebaaj ko out karne kii bhi koshish kar saktaa he: The position of a keeper depends on the bowler: when fast bowling, he stands slightly away from the stumps, so that he has time to catch the ball coming off the edge of the bat, while in slow bowling he stumps
 k gets very close, so that the pressure is on the batsman to stay inside the crease or risk getting stumped out
 keeper jitna zyada sakasham hoga, utani hi tej gendbaaji ko lapakane main vah kaamyaab rahegaa, udhaaharan ke liye aapako bataa den ki godfre ivance aksar alek bedsar ke liye wicket keeping karte the
 Wicket-keeping is a specialist job and requires the same type of training as expected from an expert batsman or bowler
 haalaanki aaj ke samay main ek wicket-keeper se ummid kii jaati he ki vah ek acha ballebaaj bhi ho jo kam se kam madhyakram main ballebaaji kar sake
 Wicket-keepers who are proficient in batting in the above order are also informally called keeper / batsman
 cricket ke kisi ek dal main sirf ek hi keeper kii jagah hoti he, aise main chayankartaaon ko aksar do yaa usase adhik daksh kiparon main se kisi ek ko chunane kii chunauti kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 It is often the case that one of the two keepers is a very good keeper, but he is just an average batsman, while the other is a keeper / batsman who is better at batting but is not as good a keeper than his opponent
 1990 ke dashak main england ke chayankartaaon ke saamne ek aisi hi chayan duvidha saamne ai thi, jab unhen jaik rasel or alek stewart ke bich kisi ek ko chunane kii chunauti mili
 He was never successful in consistently choosing either of these until Russell began to languish in 1998: both roles were switched up before that, with good batting often making Stewart his place in the team Used to be successful
 isi tarah pakistani wicket keeper kamran akmal bhi ek or udhaaharan he jo ek aise wicket keeper ke taur par janaa jaataa he jo aasaan maukon ko ganvaata he, lekin vah pichley ek dashak se team main apni jagah banaae hue hai, kyonki unki ballebaaji vaikalpik keeper se acchhee he
 Today in cricket Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Kumar Sangakkara, Brandon mccullum and Mark Boucher are the best keeper / batsman
 keeper kii captaini kii bhoomika bhi ho sakati he
 The special thing is that he is involved in every ball of an innings and may not be as captain as he is in a position to watch things closely
 unhen aksar gendbaajon ko utsahit karte hue dekha ja saktaa he or vah ballebaajon ko unki kshamta, vyaktitv or nijee aadaton par sateek tippaniyon se "apshabd" kehane main bhi lipt main hota he
 The keeper is the only fielder allowed to catch the ball with a defensive device, which is usually a large padded knob with a mesh between the index finger and thumb
 dastaane se jo suraksha milti he vah hameshaa paryaapt nahin hoti he
 England keeper Alan Knott sometimes padded his gloves inside for extra protection
 wicket-keeper pairon kii suraksha ke liye leg pads or qamar ke neeche vaale hisse kii raksha ke liye box kaa istemaal karte hai
 Wicket-keepers are given the opportunity to take off their pads and bowl, and this often happens when a match is progressing on par or the fielding team is desperate to take a wicket
 pratham shrenee cricket main do wicket-kiparon ne apana pad utaara or phir hetric lee he: 1954-55 main katak main khele gaye urisa banaam bengal ke match main probir sen or asi smith ne 1965 main clacton main varavikshire banaam asex ke match main; smith ek behad hi asaamaanya khilaadi the, kyonki wo mukhya taur par ek wicket-keeper the, lekin kabhi-kabhi unka chayan mukhya gendbaaj ke rup main bhi hota tha
 According to Rule 2 of the rules of cricket, a substitute player cannot keep wicket
 ballebaaji dal ke captain kii sahmati se kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko radd bhi kiya ja saktaa he, haalaanki niyam 2 main is tarah kii kisi sahmati kii ijaajat nahin detaa he
 For example, during the first innings of the Test match between England and New Zealand being played at Lord's in 1986, England's specialist wicket-keeper Bruce French was injured
 tab england ne newjiland kii pehali pari main chaar khilaadiyon ko wicket-keeper ke taur par istemaal kiya: bill athe ne pehle do overon ke liye keeping kii; 45 saal ke varisht khilaadi bob tailor ko praayojakon ke tent se bulaakar keeping karai gayi or unhone 3 se 76 overon tak bina galati ke badhiya keeping kii; 77 se 140 overon tak ke liye hampshire ke keeper bobi parks ko bulaayaa gaya; or phir bruce french ne pari kii aakhri gend tak wicket keeping kii

 a batch 'spreadsheet' is indistinguishable from a batch compiler with added input data, which produces an output report
 However, this concept of electronic spreadsheet was outlined by Richard Matesich in the 1961 paper "budgeting Model and System Simulation"
 a computerized spreadsheet applied by Matesich for subsequent work and its companion edition, Matesich accounting and budgeting systems
 These batch spreadsheets were primarily concerned with the addition or subtraction of entire columns or rows and not individual 'cells'

 Important inventions in the development of electronic spreadsheets Rene
 Pardo and Remy Landau, who in 1970 entered the spreadsheet automated natural order recalculation algorithm in 1971 US Patent 43,98,249
 jabaki patent ko shuru main ek vishuddh ganitiya avishkaar hone ke kaaran, 12 varshon kii apil ke baad, patent karyaalay dwaara asweekaar kar diya gaya, pardo or landau ne CCPA main ek ugantkaari mukadmaa jeeta jisane 1983 main patent karyaalay ke nirnay ko palat diya - or yah sthapit kiya ki "koi chiz keval isliye patent kii yogyata nahin kho sakati kyonki naveenta kii bindu ek elgorithm main he
 "however, in 1995 the US Appellate Court for the Federal Circuit declared this patent unenforceable
 
 The actual software was called LANPAR - Language for Programming Arrays at Random
 It was conceived and developed in the summer of 1969, after Pardo and Landau recently graduated from Harvard University
 sah-avishkaarak rene pardo yaad karte hai ki unhone mahasoos kiya ki bel canada ke ek prabandhak ko bajet prapatron ko banane or sanshodhit karne ke liye programmer par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chahie or unhone upyogkartaaon dwaara prapatr ko kisi bhi kram main tip karne kii kalpana kii jiske parinaamon kii gananaa computer sahi kram main karegaa

 kai companiyon ne, bilkul bhinn pratimaan par aadhaarit program ke saath spredshit bazaar main daakhil hone kaa prayaas kiya
 For example Lotus started a program that was most successful, Lotus Improv, which had some commercial success, particularly in the financial world where its powerful data mining capabilities are still respected today
 spredshit 2000 ne sutara nirmaan ko naatakeey rup se saral karne kaa prayaas kiya, lekin aam taur par safal nahin rahaa
 An "eat" can be thought of as a box containing a figure
 ek ekal khaane ko aamtaur par iske stambh or pankti se sandarbhit kiya jaataa he 
 saamagree ke anusaar iske aakaar ko badalane ke liye aamtaur par isaki lambaai yaa chaudaai ko milan rekhaon ko khinch kar kiya ja saktaa he box 
 The array of mines is called a "sheet" or "worksheet"
 paaramparik computer program main yah char kii ek vyuh rachana ke anuroop he 
 adhikansh prayogon main, kai kaaryapatrak ko ek ekal spredshit ke bheetar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 a worksheet is simply a subdivision of a spreadsheet that is divided for clarity
 kaaryaatmak rup se, ek spredshit sampoornataa main sanchalit hoti he or spredshit ke bheetar sabhi khaane vaishvik char ke rup main sanchalit hote hai 
 a cell can contain a value or a formula, or it can simply be left blank
 parampara ke anusaar, sutara aamtaur par = sanket ke saath shuru hote hai
 a value can be entered from a computer keyboard or typed directly into a field
 vaikalpik rup se, ek maan kisi sutara par aadhaarit ho saktaa he, jo ek pariklan kar saktaa he, vartmaan dinaank yaa samay dikhaa saktaa he, ek bahya data ko praapt kar saktaa he jaise stock kot yaa database mulya
 Spreadsheet value rule
 Some initial spreadsheets required manual requests for recalculation, because large or complex spreadsheet calculations often reduced data entry speed
 kai aadhunik spredshits abhi bhi is vikalp ko barkaraar rakhe hue he
 This feature requires updating the contents of a cell periodically when its value is taken from an external source - such as a field in another "remote" spreadsheet
 For shared and web-based spreadsheets, this applies to the "immediate" update field that has been changed by another user
 sabhi nirbhar khaanon ko bhi adhyatan kiya janaa hota he
 Once entered, the selected fields can optionally be "closed" to avoid accidental rewrite
 aam taur par yah un khaanon par lagu hota he jisamen sutara hote hai, lekin un par bhi lagu ho saktaa he jisamen "sthiraank" hote hai jaise ek kilogram / pound roopantaran kaarak 
 vyaktigat khaane ko band chihnit kiye jane ke baavjood, spredshit ke aankade tab tak surakshit nahin hai jab tak is suvidha ko fil variyataon main sakriy nahin kiya jaataa
 a field or range can optionally be defined to specify how the value will be displayed
 The default display format is usually determined by its initial content, if it has not been specifically pre-determined, so for example "31 / 12 / 2007" or "january 31, 2007", the "date" of the field The format is the default
 isi prakaar, ek sankhyatmak maan ke baad ek % sanket jodne se vah khaanaa pratishat cell formet ke rup main tag hoga
 khaane kii saamagree is praaroop se parivartit nahin hogi, keval pradarshit maan badalegaa
 Some food formats such as "numeric" or "currency" can also specify the number of decimal places
 " This may allow illegal operation, leading to illogical results without proper warning
 spredshit anuprayog kii kshamta par nirbhar karte hue, prayek kaksh ko pruthak rup se swaroopit kiya ja saktaa he jiske liye yaa to saamagree kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he yaa kaksh kaa 
 ek spredshit kii pathneeyata main vruddhi karne ke liye, kaksh swarupan ko sashart data par lagu kiya ja saktaa he - udhaaharan ke liye, ek rinatmak sankhya ko laal rang main pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The formatting of a cell generally does not affect its contents and depending on how the cells are referenced or copied to other worksheets or applications, formatting may or may not be done with the content
 adhikansh prayogon main, ek kaksh, yaa ek stambh yaa pankti main kakshon ke samooh kaa "namakaran" kiya ja saktaa he jisase upyogkarta us kaksh ko grid sandarbh ke bajaay naam dwaara sandarbhit karne main sakasham hota he
 Names must be unique within a spreadsheet, but when a spreadsheet file uses multiple sheets, a similarly named cell range can be used on each sheet if it is identified by adding the sheet name
 is prayog ke liye ek kaaran he macrose kaa nirmaan yaa parichaalan jo kai shit main ek aadesh ko doharaata he
 Another reason is that the formulas containing the named variables are tested quickly against the algebra they implement
 The use of named variables and named verbs also makes the spreadsheet structure more transparent
 kisi namit kaksh ke sthaan par, ek vaikalpik drushtikon he kaksh sandarbh kaa prayog
 adhikansh kaksh sandarbh, samaan spredshit main ek anya kaksh kaa sanket dete hai, lekin ek kaksh sandarbh ek samaan spredshit ke bheetar ek alag kaksh ko sandarbhit kar saktaa he, yaa puri tarah se kisi anya spredshit main ek kaksh ko, yaa ek duurastha anuprayog se kisi maan ko
 a typical cell reference in the "A1" style is made up of one or two case-sensitive letters to identify the column followed by the row number
 Either part can be relative, or absolute
 The optional "R1C1" reference style consists of the letter R, the row number, the letter C, and the column number; The relative row or column number is indicated by enclosing the number in square brackets
 sabase haal ke spredshit A1 style kaa upyog karte hai, jinamein se kuch ek sangatta vikalp ke rup main R1C1 style pradaan karte hai
 When a computer calculates a formula to update the displayed value of that cell in a cell, the cell references in that cell that designate another cell prompt the computer to fetch the value of the named cell
 samaan "shit" main ek kaksh ko aamtaur par is rup main sambodhit kiya jaataa he:- a cell on a separate sheet of the same spreadsheet is usually addressed as: - kuch spredshit karyanvayan, ek kaksh sandarbh ko ek hi computer yaa ek sthaneey network par anya spredshit main anumati dete hai 
 yah, ek hi computer yaa network par kisi anya khuli or sakriya spredshit main ek kaksh ko sandarbhit kar saktaa he jise saajha-yogya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 These references contain the complete filename, such as: - ek spredshit main, kakshon ke liye sandarbh swatah navinikrut ho jate hai, jab nai panktiyon yaa stambhon ko sammilit yaa nasht kiya jaataa he
 But special care must be taken when adding a row in front of a column sum to ensure that the value of the additional rows is displayed in the sum - which is not often! ek vrittiya sandarbh tab hota he jab ek kaksh ke sutara main aisa sandarbh hota he jo pratyaksh-yaa paroksh rup se, sandarbhon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se, prayek kaksh anya kaksh kii ore ishaara karata he jisamen agle kaksh ke liye shrinkhalaa par sandarbh he - ek kaksh kii ore sanket karata he
 Several common types of errors induce such circular references
 haalanki, aisi kuch vaid takneekein hai jo ki is tarah ke vrittiya sandarbh kaa upyog kar rahi hai
 Such techniques converge to the correct values for those cells after several recalculations of the spreadsheet
 isi tarah, kakshon kii namankit shrenee kaa upyog karne ke bajaay, ek shrenee sandarbh kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 a reference to a range of cells is common to a form that specifies all cells in the range A1 through A6
 "= SUM " jaisaa ek sutara sabhi nirdisht kakshon ko jod saktaa he or parinaam ko sutara vaale kaksh main hi rakhata he
 In the initial spreadsheet, the cells were a simple two-dimensional grid
 samay ke saath, model ko vistaarit karte hue ek tisare aayam ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya or kuch maamalon main namit grid kii ek shrinkhalaa ko, jise shits kaha jaataa he
 The most advanced example is data allowing rotation and inverse operations that can present and sort data sets in various ways
 ek sutara us pariklan kii pahchaan karata he jisaki aavashyaktaa parinaam ko us kaksh main rakhane ke liye hoti he jisamen vah nihit hota he
 The performance of a cell containing a formula therefore has two components; That formula itself and the resulting value
 That formula is normally shown only when a particular cell is selected by "clicking" that cell, otherwise it contains the result of the calculation
 ek sutara kisi kaksh yaa kakshon kii shrinkhalaa ke liye maan detaa he or aam taur par iskaa praaroop he: Where the expression includes: jab kisi kaksh main koi sutara shaamil hota he, to usamen aksar anya kakshon ke liye sandarbh shaamil hota he
 Such a cell is a type of reference variable
 iskaa maan, sandarbhit kaksh yaa isaki kisi vyutpatti kaa maan he
 If that cell in turn refers to another cell, the value depends on their value
 sandarbh, saapeksh ho saktaa he, nirpeksh yaa mishrit pankti-waar yaa stambh-waar nirpeksh / saapeksh 
 The options available for valid formulas depend on particular spreadsheet implementations but, in general, most arithmetic operations and fairly complex nested conditional operations can be executed by most commercial spreadsheets today
 aadhunik karyanvayan, custom-nirmit kriyaaon, duurastha data or anuprayogon ke abhigam ke liye bhi sankriyaayein pesh karte hai
 a formula may include a condition - without or with actual calculation - and is sometimes used solely to uncover and identify errors
 neeche die gaye udhaaharan main, yah mana gaya he ki pratishat ke stambh ke yoga ko vaidhata ke liye jaancha jaataa he or ek spasht sandesh ko asann dayee taraf ke kaksh main daalaa jaataa he
 a spreadsheet does not need to hold a formula and in that case it would be considered just a collection of data organized into rows and columns such as a calendar, timetable, or simple list
 Many spreadsheets are used for this purpose only because of its ease of use, formatting, and hyperlinking capabilities
 spredshit main aamtaur par kai aapurti kii gai kriyaayein shaamil hoti hai, jaise ankaganit sankriyaayein trikonmiti sankriyaayein, sankhyikeey kriyaayein or isi tarah anya
 iske alaava vahaan aksar prayokta-paribhaashit kriyaayein ke liye ek praavdhaan he
 In Microsoft Excel, these functions are defined using Visual Basic in the provided Visual Basic Editor and such actions are automatically accessible on the worksheet
 iske atirikt, aise program ko likhaa ja saktaa he jo kaaryapatrak se jaankaree khinche, kuch pariklan kare or parinaamon ko waapas kaaryapatrak main suchit kare
 chitra main, sq naam prayokta-pradutt he or kriya sq ko Excel ke saath pradaan kii kiye gaye Visual Basic ke prayog se pesh kiya gaya he
 The name manager displays spreadsheet definitions of named variables x and y
 kriyaayein khud kaaryapatrak main nahin likh sakati, balki keval apana moolyankan lautaati hai
 However, in Microsoft Excel, a subroutine can write values or text found in a subroutine directly to a spreadsheet
 yah aankada, ek sabaroutine ke liye Visual Basic code ko darshata he jisamen namit stambh char x ke prayek sadsy kaa naam he, apane varg kii gananaa karata he or us maan ko namit stambh char y ke tatsthani tatv main likhata he
 The y-column has no formula because its value is calculated in the subroutine, not on the spreadsheet and written only inside
 jab bhi ek kaksh yaa kakshon ke samooh ke liye ek sandarbh banaaya jaataa he jo vartmaan bhautik spredshit fil ke bheetar sthit nahin hai, to ise ek "duurastha" spredshit ke abhigam ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The contents of the referenced cell can be accessed on the first reference with a manual update or, as recently as in the case of web-based spreadsheets, as a real-time value with a specified automatic driven refresh interval
 kai spredshit anuprayog, chart, rekhankan yaa histogram kii anumati dete he jise kaksh ke nirdisht samoohon se utpann kiya jaataa he jo kaksh saamagree ke parivartan ke saath gatisheel rup se nirmit hote hai
 The generated graphic component can either be contained in the current sheet or added as a separate object
 1980 ke dashak ke uttarardh or 1990 ke dashak ke purvardh main, pehla Javelin Software or baad main Lotus Improv saamne aae or paaramparik spredshit main ek model ke vipareet, ve un model kaa upyog karte hai jinhen char kahi jane vaali vastu par banaaya jaataa he, na ki ek report ke kakshon main nihit data par

 This is an example of the primary contribution of early Javelin - which was the concept of traceability of a user's logic or model structure through its twelve views
 a complex model can be divided and understood by others who have no hand in its construction and it remains unique even today
 Javelin kaa istemaal mukhya rup se vittiya modelling ke liye kiya gaya tha, lekin iskaa prayog college ke rasayan vigyaan ke paathyakramon main anudeshaatmak model ke nirmaan main, duniya kii arthvyavasthaaon ko swaroopit karne main or sena dwaara aarambhik star waar pariyojna main bhi kiya gaya
 yah aaj bhi un sansthaaon dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he jinke liye model akhandta mahatvapurn mishan he
 In these programs, a time series, or any variable, was a goal in itself, not a collection of cells that appears only in a column or row
 char kii kai visheshtaayen ho sakati hai, jisamen shaamil hai anya sabhi charon ke saath unke sampark kii puri jaankaree, data sandarbh or text or chhavi note
 gananaa ko in vastuon par sampadit kiya gaya, jo kakshon kii shrenee ke vipareet tha, isliye do samay shrinkhalaa ko jodne se ve swachaalit rup se calendar samay main jud jate hai, yaa ek prayokta-paribhaashit samay seemaa main
 data, kaaryapatrak-char se swatantra the or isliye data ko ek pankti, stambh yaa sampurna kaaryapatrak ko mitaane ke dwaara bhi nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 udhaaharan ke liye, janvari kii laagat ko janvari ke rajasav main se ghataya jaataa he, isse koi fark nahin padataa ki donon kaaryapatrak par dikhte hai yaa nahin
 isse un kriyaaon kii anumati milti he jise pivat teble main istemaal kiya gaya tha, sivaay iske ki report saarini kaa lacheela her-pher un tamaam kshamtaaon main se ek tha jo char dwaara samarthit tha
 In addition, if costs are recorded by week and revenue by month, Javelin's program can allocate or interpolate in the right direction
 is vastu dizin ne char or puure model ko prayokta paribhaashit char naam ke saath ek duusare ko sandarbhit karne main sakasham banaaya or bahuaiami vishleshan ko or bade paimaane ke aasaani se sampadit kiye jane yogya samekan ko pradarshit kiya
 Spreadsheets, which have a formula language based on logical expressions rather than arithmetic expressions, are called logical spreadsheets
 aise spredshits ko unke kaksh maan ke bare main nigamanaatmak tareeke se tark dene ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Just as early programming languages were designed to generate spreadsheet printouts, programming techniques themselves have evolved so much that they can process data tables more efficiently in the computer itself
 vikaas karte hue spredshit ne VBA jaisi shaktishaalee programing bhashaaon kaa upyog karnaa shuru kiya; vishesh rup se, ve kaaryaatmak, drishyaatmak or bahu-pratimaan bhashaaen hai
 Many people find it easier to perform calculations in spreadsheets than to write similar sequential programs
 aisa spredshits ke do gunon ke kaaran he
 a 'spreadsheet program' is designed to perform general computing tasks for which it uses spatial relationships rather than time as the primary organizing principle
 
 It is often convenient to view a spreadsheet as a mathematical graph, where the nodes are the cells and edges of the spreadsheet are references to other cells specified in the formulas
 This is often called the dependency graph of a spreadsheet
 kakshon ke bich sandarbh ko sthanik avadharanaon kaa laabh mil saktaa he jaise saapeksh sthiti or nirpeksh sthiti, saath hi saath namit sthaan, taaki spredshit sutron ko samajhnaa or prabandhit karnaa adhik aasaan ho sake
 Spreadsheets usually attempt to automatically update cells when the cells on which they depend have been changed
 aarambhik spredshit main saral takneekon kaa prayog hota tha jaise ek vishesh kram main kakshon kaa moolyankan, lekin aadhunik spredshit, nirbharta graph se ek nunatam pun:sanganana kram kii gananaa karti he
 Subsequent spreadsheets had a limited ability to propagate the values in reverse, changing the source values in such a way that a particular answer reached a certain cell
 chunki spredshit ke kaksha sutara aamtaur par vyutkramntic nahin hai, phir bhi, is takanic kaa kuch had tak simit mahatv he
 Many concepts, common in sequential programming models, correspond to them in the spreadsheet world
 udhaaharan ke liye, anukramit loop ke anukramik model ko aam taur par samaan sutron ke saath kaksha kii ek talika ke rup main darshaya jaataa he, 
 While spreadsheets are a major step forward in quantitative modeling, they also have drawbacks
 samgr prayokta laabh ke str par, spredshit main kai pramukh kamiyaan hai, vishesh rup se alpha newmeric khaanon ke paton ke amithravat hone se sambandhit
 Other problems associated with spreadsheets include: jabaki desktop ke liye antah nirmit or tisare paksh upkaran jo in kamiyon, jaagrukta or upyog ko sambodhit karata he aam taur par kam hote hai
 
 a good example of this is that 55% of capital market professionals do not know how to audit their spreadsheets; Only 6% invest in third party solutions
 gud, eekh, tad aadi ke ras ko ubalkar kar sukhaane se praapt hone vaala thos padaarth he
 Its color can range from pale yellow to thick brown

 This industry is also very popular in South India
 yahan par gud eekh ke ras ke atirikt tad ke ras, yaa mithi tadi se bhi banaaya jaataa he
 This juice comes out of these trees, especially in summer
 ab to bharat ke sabhi pradeshon main, jahaan ye vriksh paae jate he, tad-gud-udyog ko kaaphi protsaahan diya ja rahaa he
 To make this, sugar cane juice is boiled in shallow kadhas
 ubaalte samay ise lagaataar hilaayaa jaataa he or isamen ashuddhiyaan nikaalane or iske gunon main vruddhi ke liye vibhinn vasteen milaayi jaati hai
 Over time, the juice of the water evaporates and the remaining semi-solid jaggery is poured into the molds and stored in different sizes
 eekh se ras nikaalnaa: deshi kolhu ke dwaara lagbhag 60-65 pratishat ras nikalataa he
 This juice is poured into big kadhas

 apdravyon ko alag karne ke pashchaat ras ko ubaalte hai
 This causes the water of the juice to evaporate
 jab ras kaa chauthai bhaag rah jaataa he tab chaashni kaaphi gadhi ho jaati he or isamen manibh banane ke lakshan dikhaai dene lagate hai
 Then put the syrup in open pots about one and a half inch thick
 jab yah thodaa garm hi rahata he tab, jab tak ardh thos na ho jaae, lakdi ke bade chammachon se chalaate hai
 Then either put them in big molds or make small whales with their hands
 tadi se gud banane kii vidhi lagbhag eekh ke ras se gud banane kii bhanti hi he
 It contains less waste
 at: unhen chhaantane ke liye chuunaa ityadi dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 It has higher glucose content and less sugar than reed jaggery
 vitamin bhi isamen adhik rahata hai
 Therefore, in terms of health, it is more beneficial than jaggery of reed
 gud ke gun par mitti, khaad aadi kaa prabhaav-yadi mitti main viley lavenon kii maatra adhik rahe to usamen paidaa hone vaali eekh kaa gud praaia: acha nahin hota

 yadi din yaa raat main kalamaatr bhi rohinee na ho to visheshkar chandramaa se mili hui raatri main is vrath ko karen
 The word of the Bhavishya Purana is that a person who does not do Krishna Janmashtami fast in the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada month is a cruel demon
 keval ashtami tithi main hi upwas karnaa kaha gaya he
 If the same date is associated with the Rohini constellation, then it will be addressed as 'jayanti'
 vahnipurana kaa vachan he ki krishnapaksh kii janmashtami main yadi ek kala bhi rohinee nakshatra ho to usko jayanti naam se hi sambodhit kiya jayega
 Therefore, one should fast with effort in it
 vishnurahasyadi vachan se- krishnapaksh kii ashtami rohinee nakshatra se yukt bhadrapada maas main ho to vah jayanti namawali hi kahi jaaegi
 Vashistha Samhita has the opinion - If the sum of both Ashtami and Rohini is incompatible in Ahoratra, then fasting should be done only in the time of Muhurta as well

 The Satavahanas were a dynasty of ancient India
 isane isapurv 230 se lekar duusari sadi tak kendriya dakshin bharat par raaj kiya
 It became powerful after the fall of the Maurya dynasty
 inkaa ullekh 8veen sadi isapurv main miltaa he
 After Ashoka's death, the Satavahanas declared themselves independent
 sise kaa sikaa chalaane vaala pehla vansh satvaahan vansh tha, or vah sise kaa sikaa rome se laayaa jaataa tha
 For the first time in ancient India, under the Maurya dynasty, we tried to establish political and cultural unity
 baad main chalakar satvaahan vansh ne is prayaas ko aage badhaayaa
 Although historians Satavahanas are the successors of the Mauryas in the Deccan, the rise of this dynasty should also be understood as a normal Jain and Hindu process against the Buddhist kingdom of Ashoka
 satvaahan vansh kii sthapana maury vansh ke paraabhav se lagbhag pachaas varsh pehle hui
 His empire was the oldest and largest empire in South India
 uttar bharat nirantar badalte rajvansheey paridrishy ke viparit satvahanon ne dakkan main atoot, avibhajya tathaa dirghakaal tak sthai rup se chalane vaale ek samrajya kii sthapana kii jisane lagbhag saadhe chaar sau varshon tak shashan kiya
 From the information we have received about this period, we get to know about the singularities of the Satavahanas and their unique activities in different fields
 yadi puraanon ke vaktavyon par vishvas kiya jaae to dakkan ke is samrajya kii simaaen uttar bharat tak faili hui thi
 Magadha was a part of this empire, also spread over southern India and its boundaries were wide from eastern to western sea
 uttar tathaa dakshin bharat kii maalav, bhoj, pathnik, rathik, andhra, parind tathaa dravid aadi vibhinn prakaar kii prajatiyon ke samanvay se is samrajya kaa nirmaan hua tha tathaa is drushti se kshetrafal main maury samrajya se kam hote hue bhi satvaahan samrajya usase kahin adhik sugathit tha
 It was a result of the long and peaceful rule given by the Satavahanas in Central India and Deccan that the art and architecture developed, examples of which we can find in the sculpted cavities in the rocks of western India and the stupas and viharas of eastern India
 is kaal main samskruti kaa bhi atyadhik vikaas hua tathaa prakrut bhashaa kaa aakarshan rajdarbaron tak pahunchaa
 Although the Satavahana kingdom was a Hindu kingdom, Buddhism developed uniquely under them
 vyapaar, vaanijya evam jal parivahan ke kshetron main bhi atyaadhik unnati hui
 There is a complete lack of information and sources giving information about the Satavahanas
 unase sambandhit shilalekhon kii sankhya bahut kam he or is prastut shilalekhon main die gaye sandarbhon main bhi satvahanon ke vishay main purna jaankaree nahi milti
 About them we have only nineteen inscriptions from the eastern Deccan
 jo is vansh ke tees raajaaon tathaa saadhe chaar sau varshon ke lambe shashan kaal ke vishay main jaankaree dene ke liye kisi bhi drushtikon se prayog nahi he
 Although the Archaeological Department carried out excavations at Paithan, Maski and Pondapur in the ancient Hyderabad state, but no more evidence was found from here
 is vishay main satvaahan vashan ke raajaaon dwaara prachlit sikke jo purvi tathaa pashchimi dakkan evam madhya pradesh se mili hai, se hamen is vansh ke vishay main mahatvapurn jaankaree milti he
 Scholars like Thomas, Rapson, Cunningham, Bhagwan Lal Indra Ji and Scott have received important information from these coins
 parantu in sikkon ke bhangit tathaa kuch sikkon ke jaali hone ke kaaran kai vivaad uth khadey hue hai
 Literary sources have disappointed even more in this subject
 moulik puraanon main kaalaantar main jude ansho ke kaaran inamen satvahanon ke vishay main di gai suchanaaen ab vishwasaneey nahi rah gai hai
 Also, the situation has become even more suspicious in the various Puranas due to the absence of death in the context of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi gunadhay dwaara rachit brihad katha ko satvaahan rajya sangrakshan main likhaa hua mana jaataa he tathaapi yah kriti ab mul rup main nahi milti tathaa i par aadhaarit uske baad ke sanskarnon main di gai soochnaaon kii vyavastha vibhinn vidwaanon alag-alag kii he
 Similarly, Lilavati, which is related to the military campaigns and victories of the Satavahana ruler period, cannot be overstated
 is karanvash satvaahan kaal ke vishay main abhi hamaari jaankaree simit he
 There are profound differences among various scholars regarding the emergence of Satavahanas and their original place of residence
 shilaalekh tathaa sikkon main varnit satvaahan or shatakarni shaskaon ko puraanon main andhra, andhra-mrity tathaa andhra jaateey naamon se pukaara gaya he
 On this basis, scholars have reached the decision that Satavahana or Shatakarani kings were equivalent to Andhra
 rapasan, smith tathaa bhandarkar ke anusaar satvaahan shaasha andhra desh se sambandhit the
 About the Andhra people, the Puranas say that they were residents of the ancient Telugu region which was situated in the middle of the Godavari and Krishna river
 etrey brahman main unka ullekh aisi jati ke rup main hua he jo aaryon ke prabhaav se mukt thi
 In Indica, Magasthenes mentioned their power and prosperity
 ashok ke shilalekhon main unka varnan aise logon ke rup main hua he jo ki uske samrajya ke prabhaav main the
 But what happened to them after the fall of the Maurya Empire is not known
 sambhavtah unhonn apane aapako swatantra ghashit kar diya
 Although the historians mentioned above consider Andhra Pradesh as the original abode of the Satavahanas, there are differences among these scholars regarding the center of their power
 jahaan smith shri kakulam ko satvahanon athwa andhron kii rajdhani maanate hai
 But scholars have differences regarding the relationship with Satavahanas
 samvaahan vansh ke shilalekhon main i kaal ke shaskaon ko nirantar rup se satvaahan athwa shatakarni kaha gaya he
 In the literary texts, the term Shali Vahan is also used for them
 parantu is sandarbh main andhra shabd kaa prayog is vansh ke kisi bhi shilaalekh main nahi he
 On the other hand, western India has been considered as their original place of residence on the basis of inscriptions, coins and literary sources
 is tathy kaa pramaan nanaghat tathaa saachin ke aarmabhik shilalekhon se bhi miltaa he
 On this basis, Dr
 Gopalachari has considered the original residence of the Satavahanas of the establishment and its surrounding area
 iske atirikt ve0es0 sukuthankar ne bellari jile ko; ech0si0raay0 choudhary ne anya desh ke dakshini hisse ko tathaa ve0ve0 mirashi ne wain ganga nadi ke donon kinaaron se lage baraar pradesh ko satvahanon kaa mul nivas sthaan mana he
 On this basis, the equivalence and homogeneity of Satavahanas and Andhra is doubtful
 is vishay main vidwaanon ne yah sujhaayaa he ki satvahanon ne apane aarmabhik jivan kii dakkan se shuruyaat kii tathaa kuch hi samay main andhra pradesh ko bhi jeet liya
 Later, when the western and northern regions of the Satavahana kingdom continued to pass through their hands due to suspicion and rich invasions, their power was probably limited to the central region between Godavari and Krishna river i
e
andhra Pradesh and now Satavahanas came to be known as Andhra
 
 satvahanon kii utpati ke vishay main bhi hamen jaankaree nahi he
 Some scholars have compared him to the Satyaputras mentioned in the inscriptions of Ashoka and some to the Setai described by Pliny
 kuch anya vidwaanon ne shabd bhasha vigyaan ke aadhaar par shatakarni tathaa satvaahan shabdon ko paribhaashit kiya he chaahe in shabdon kii mahatta kuch bhi rahi ho parantu satvaahan vansh ke shilalekhon ke aadhaar par yah lagbhag nishchit he ki satvaahan bhi shunga tathaa kanv shaskaon kii tarah brahman the
 The proof of this is also found in the Nasik inscription, in which Gautami's son Shri Shatkarni has been decorated as a Brahmin and Khatiyya-swa-man-madan, ie, a man who marshals of Kshatriyas, etc
 isi shilaalekh ke lekhak ne gautamiputra kii tulana parashuram se kii he
 In addition, in the Datrishatputlika also, the Shalivahanas are said to have originated from mixed Brahmin caste and Nagajati
 satvahanon ke kalkram ko lekar vidwaanon main gahare matbhed hai
 The Aitreya Brahmana, which was written in 500 BC, mentions the bandits who were outside the Arya Periphery and who were the descendants of Vishwamitra
 is aadhaar par dody0aar0 bhandarkar ne 500 i0purv ko satvahanon kii aarmabhik sthiti mana he
 According to Dr
 V
 A
 Smith, Andhra was subordinate at first, but after his death he became independent under the leadership of Simukh and this incident happened in the third century BCE
 is vishay main smith ne puraanon kaa hi aadhaar mana he jinke anusaar andhron ke kul tees shaskaon ne lagbhag 460varshon tak shashan kiya
 Dr
 Gopalachari also accepted this fact by acknowledging that the Satavahana dynasty was founded around 235 AD and its fall in about 255 AD
 kaling ke shaasha kharkhel ke rajyakaal main utkeern hathi gumpha shilaalekh ke aadhaar par rapasan satvaahan vansh kaa armbh 220 i0purv tathaa 211 i0purv ke bich maanate he parantu satvahanon ke yasana kaal ko lekar vibhinn puraanon main bhi mataantar he
 On one hand, where the Matsya Purana states their total Yasan period is 460 years, on the other hand, in Brahmapuran this period is stated to be 456 years

 puraanon main varnit ek vaktavy ke aadhaar par unhone yah mana he ki, ‘‘shunga mrity’’ kanv shaasha shunga shaskaon ke sevak the tathaa peshwaon kii bhaanti unke saath-saath shashan karte the tathaa simuk athwa shishuk naamak satvaahan vansh ke sansthaapak ne kanv raja sushraman ko markar kanv tathaa shunga dono vansho kaa ant kar diya tathaa unke samrajya ko apane aadhin kar liya
 But this fact is unbelievable because we know very well that the rulers of Sunga and Kanva dynasty never ruled jointly and Vasudeva Kanva, the founder of Kanva dynasty, took over the reins of the reign by killing the last Sunga ruler Devbhuti
 vayupurana ke us vaktavy jiske aadhaar par dobhandarkar ne galat vyakhya kii he, ko doray choudhary ne sahi bhang se paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, this dirty volume tells this much that when Simuk ended the Kanva dynasty and established the Satavahana dynasty, he also abolished the Sunga rulers who remained after the defeat of the Sunga rulers at the hands of the Kanva dynasty
 
 atev satvaahan shaskaon ne 29 i0purv main kanv vansh kaa ant kar swayan shashan kii bagdor sanbhali
 But notwithstanding all these factors one cannot deny the possibility that Simuk, who ruled for 23 years, would have been enthroned sometime back i
e
 in the middle of the first century BCE
 simuk satvaahan vansh kaa sansthaapak tha tathaa usne 235 i0pus0 se lekar 212i0pus0 tak lagbhag 23 varshon tak shashan kiya
 Although we do not get much information about it, it is known from the Puranas that by destroying the power of the Kanva rulers and suppressing the remaining Sunga chiefs, he laid the foundation of the Satavahana dynasty
 puraanon main use simec ke atirikt shishuk, sindhuk tathaa shiprak aadi naamon se bhi pukaara gaya he
 According to Jain observers, Simuk built Jain and Buddhist temples during his reign, but at the end of his reign, he was stunned and cruel due to which he was removed and murdered
 simuk kii mrityu ke pashchaat uskaa chota bhai kanha rajgaddi par baitha
 During his 18-year tenure, Kanha adopted the policy of empire expansion
 nasik ke shilaalekh se yah pataa chalata he ki kanha ke samay main satvaahan samrajya pashchim main nasik tak fail gaya tha
 After shatkarni-i Kanha, Shatkarni ascended the first throne
 puraanon ke anusaar vah kanha putr tha
 But Dr
 Gopalachari considers Simuk as the father of Shatkarni I
 kuch vidwaanon ne yah mana he ki iskaa shashan kaal maatra do varsh rahaa parantu nilkantha shastri ne uskaa shashan kaal 194 i0pus0 se lekar 185 i0pus0 mana he
 However, it is clear that his reign was not very long
 parantu chota hote hue bhi shatakarni pratham kaa kaarykaal kuch drushtikonon se bada mahatvapurn he
 He was the first among the Satavahana rulers who named him by the word "shatkarni", beloved and popular among the rulers of this dynasty
 nanaghat shilaalekh ke anusaar shatakarni ne apane samrajya kaa khub vistaar kiya tathaa apane kaary kaal main do ashwamegh yajna tathaa ek rajasuy yajna kiya
 From an inscription of her queen Nayanika, we learn that Shatkarni i conquered western Malwa as well as Anup and Vidarbha regions
 yadi shatakarni pratham hi vah shaasha he jiskaa ullekh sanchi stupa ke torana main hua he to yah bhi is baat ko pramanit karata he ki uske samay main madhya bharat satvahanon ke adhikaar main tha
 He became the emperor during his work with his umbrellas and he took the titles like Dakshin Pathapati and the Untamed Chakra etc
 nanaghat lekh tathaa hathi gumpha lekhon main prayukt lipi kii samanta ke aadhaar par hi yah sujhaayaa gaya he ki kadaachit isi shatakarni shaskaon ke shashan kaal ke duusare varsh main kaling ke mahaan shaasha kharkhel ne yuddh kshetra main haraaya tha
 Shatkarni I's wife Nayanika or Naganika was the daughter of a maestro, Tranakairo, of Angiyan clan
 shatakarni pratham kii mrityu ke pashchaat uske do alpavyask putr vedashri tathaa satshri singhaasana par baithe
 But being a minor, the administration took the reins of his mother Nayanika, who ruled with the help of her father
 aisa prathit hota he ki vedashri kii alpaayu main hi mrityu ho gai tathaa satshri ne uske uttaradhikari ke rup main shashan sambhala
 But the Puranas are unanimous that after Satakarni I, a king named Purnotsang sat on the throne Satavahana
 chaahe chaturth satvaahan shaasha kaa naam kuch bhi rahaa ho, yah to nishchit he ki is shaasha ke shashan kaal main hi pushyamitra shunga ne antim maury shaasha brahadrath ko maar kar magadh rajya par adhikaar kar liya tha
 In Matsyapuran, Skandastambhi is mentioned as the fifth ruler of the Satavahana dynasty but most scholars consider this name to be fictitious
 shatakarni dwitiya ne lagbhag 166 i0pus0 se lekar 111 i0pus0 tak shashan kiya
 It was probably the same ruler who is mentioned in the inscriptions Heathigumpha and Bhilsa
 yah prathit hota he ki iske shashan kaal main satvahanon ne purvi malwa ko pushyamitra shunga ke ek uttaradhikari se chin liya
 According to the Puranas, after Shatkarni II, Lambodar ascended the throne
 lambodar ke pashchaat uskaa putr apilak gaddi par baitha
 Appellant who was the eighth Satavahana ruler, the period between these two is considered to be the dark age in the context of Satavahanas in which only the period of Kuntal Shatakarni can be considered as an exception
 kuntal shatakarni, apilak ke pashchaat satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatvapurn shaasha tha
 In the Kamasutra, Vatsyayan mentions Kuntal Shatkarni, writing that he used his fingers as a scissor and that his patrani Malayavati died from the stroke
 kawyaminmasha main rajeshwar ne kuntal shatakarni kaa varnan karte hue kaha he ki usne apane ranivas main rahane vaali apni raniyon ko yah aadesh diya tha ki ve keval praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karen
 Hall was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi usne keval chaar varsh hi shashan kiya tathaapi kuch vishyon uskaa shashan kaal bahut mahatvapurn rahaa
 It is believed that if Shatkarni was the greatest as the first warrior among the early Satavahana rulers, Hall was a pioneer as a peacekeeper
 haal saahitiyik abhiruchi bhi rakhata tha tathaa ek kavi samraat ke rup main prakhyat hua
 His name is mentioned in the Puranas, Lilavati, Saptashati, Abhidhan Chintamani etc

 Gunadhya, the author of Brihatkatha, was also a recent contemporary and probably composed this book written in Paisachi language under his recent patronage

 There Vijayanand heard the discussion of Lilavati, the very beautiful daughter of the King of Sri Lanka, whom she described from her King Hall
 haal ne prayaas kar leelavati se vivaah kar liya
 Legend has it that some military operations were carried out in the eastern Deccan, but due to lack of evidence, most scholars consider it wrong
 yadhyapi haal tak ke satvaahan shaskaon ke shasankaal main rajnatik kshetra ke atirikt saahitiyik tathaa aarthik kshetron main bhi atyaadhik vikaas hua tathaa vyapaar-vaanijya shaharon ke vikaas evam jalaparivahan kii unnati hui jo ki pratham shatabdi i0 ke duusare mundalak athwa puridransen ke shashan kaal main apane utkarsh kii paraakaashtha par pahunch gai, tathaapi aane vaale lagbhag pachaas varsh satvaahan samrajya ke liye bade hi kathin sabit hue
 It seemed as if the Satavahana Empire was about to collapse with the foreign invasion of the West Satraps
 kushaan uttar-pashchim main apana prasar kar rahe the tathaa unke dabaav main shaq tathaa pehlaav shaasha madhya tathaa pashchimi bharat kii ore aakarshith hokar satvahanon se sangharsh karne ko aatur the
 The Western Kshatrapas of the Kshatra dynasty had established themselves in Paschima Rajputana, Gujarat and Kathiawar
 in shaq shaskaon ne 35 i0 se lekar lagbhag 90i0 tak satvaahan rajya par akraman kiye
 He conquered the eastern and Paiyachma Malwa territories by the Satavahanas; Northern Konkan also dominated northern Maharashtra, which was the center of the Satavahana power and extended to southern Banavasi
 kshahraat vansh kaa pehla shaasha ghumak tha jisaki jaankaree ke strot kuch sikken he jo ki adhikanshtah gujarat kathiyawad ke tateey pradesh tathaa yadakada malwa se paae hai
 Ghoomak's successor was Nahapan, whose information we hold on his majority of coins is the title of king
 vahiin shilalekhon uski oopaadhi kshatrap tathaa mahakshatrap mili
 His inscriptions of Nashik, Karle and Junar; All of the donations made by SK majority coins and his Jamta Shak Ashwadat in northern and southern India testify that the empire of the Kshatra dynasty was very vast at the time of Nahapan and that it had taken away a large territory from the Satavahana rulers
 Was made so huge
 nahpaan tathaa uske jamata shaq ashavdath ne malwa, narmada ghati, uttari konkan, baraar kaa pashchima bhaag evam or dakshini maharashtra ko jitkar pashchimi dakkan main satvaahan shakti ko lrabhr ukhaad phanka
 The Satavahana kings who were defeated at the hands of Nahapan were probably the beautiful Shatakarni, Chakor Shatkarni and Sivasati, whose tenure was very short, but this situation did not last long and as the Satavahana ruler of Gautami son Sri Shatakarni became the new ruler in this quasi-satavahana struggle Turned
 lagbhag aadhi shatabdi kii uthapatak tathaa shaq shaskaon ke haathon manamardan ke baad gautami putr shri shatakarni ke netritv main apni khoi hui pratishtha ko purnsthapit kar liya
 Gautami's son Sri Shatkarni was the greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, who ruled for nearly 25 years, not only restored the lost prestige of his empire but also established a vast empire
 gautami putr ke samay tathaa uski vijayon ke baaren main hamen uski mata gautami balashri ke nasik shilalekhon se sampoorn jaankaree milti he
 Gautamiputra Satkarni is also considered by some experts to be King Shalivahana
 unhone puure bharat ko ekajute kar diya or videshi hamalaavaron ke khilaaf bachaaya
 In this context, we get information from this article that he has made the ego of Kshatriyas honorable
 uskaa varnan shaq, yavan tathaa pehlaav shasaskon ke vinaash karta ke rup main hua he
 His greatest achievement was the defeat of Shaka ruler Nahapan of the Kshatra dynasty and his descendants at his hands
 jogalthambi samuh se praapt nahpaan ke chandi ke sikken jinhe ki gautami putr shatakarni ne dubaara dhalvaaya tathaa apane shashan kaal ke atharahawein varsh main gautami putr dwaara nasik ke nikat pandu-len main guhaadaan karnaa- ye kuch aise tathy he jon yah pramanit karaten he ki usne shaq shaskaon dwaara chhine gaye pradeshon ko purnvijit kar liya
 His war with Nahapan took place in the 17th and 18th years of his reign, and after winning this war, the son of Gagatami abducted, Anoop, Saurashtra, Kukar, Akar and Avanti from being drunk
 in kshetron ke atirikt gautami putr kaa rishik, ayamak, mulak tathaa vidarbha aadi pradeshon par bhi adhipaty tha
 The area under its direct influence extended from Malwa and Kathiawar in the north to the Krishna River in the south and from Berar in Puwa to Konkan in the west

 It seems that shortly before his death, the territories won by Gautami's son Shatkarni defeated Nahapan and passed away
 gautami putr se in pradeshon ko chhinane vaale sambhawatah sithian jati ke hi karadaamak vansh ke shaq shaasha the
 We find evidence of this by Talmi from his book describing geography
 aisa hi nishkarsh 150 i0 ke prasiddh rudradaman ke junagarh ke shilaalekh se bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 This inscription shows that Rudradaman captured all the territories of Gautamiputra Shatkarni, who had been conquered by Nahapan
 aisa prathit hota he ki gautamiputra shatakarni ne karadaamak shakon se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar rudradaman dwaara hathiyaae gaye apane kshetron ko surakshit karne kaa prayaas kiya

 The criterion, that terrorism otherwise The use of functions would not be justified as terrorism would not be considered if they were government approved
 If it were a "legitimate" government authorized by example For Rann, a city that is designed to influence civilian support for a reason, firebombing terrorism will not be considered
 This criterion is inherently and problematic because it is not universally accepted: this state Deny the existence of terrorism, whether it can perform the same task or as terrorism, based on whether its sponsorship is known to a "legitimate" government Security can not be; "validity" is kasuti saarvbhaumik sweekaar kiye jate hai nahin he in kaarnon ke liye

 The story begins with Simran, a young woman who is married to Sudhir, a well-to-do and former husband of her dead sister
 simran is shart par sudhir se shaadi ko raji hoti he ki vah sudhir or sonia ke bete kii parvarish kar sake
 Troubled by a life of monotony and uninteresting marriage, Simran's love affair begins with her college lover, Sunny, when she accidentally meets him
 sani barason baad simran kii jindagi main aata he
 In this way she starts making excuses to Sudhir that she is meeting Sunny daily
 apane is prem-prasang main simran itani tallin hoti he ki vah bivi or maan kaa ferj bhul jaati, use mahasoos hota he ki usne ek baari galati kar di he
 She decides to end the issue forever, but is surprised when Sunny finds out about another woman named Radhika
 simran ko apan galati kaa ehsaas hota he ki kyon vah sani ke saath hambistar hui, isliye ki vah apni vartmaan shaadi se naakhush thi
 This betrayal of himself makes him extremely sorry
 is dauraan, sudhir ko apni bivi kii aswabhaavik bartaavon par andeh hota he, or simran kii gatividhiyon par nigahabani ke liye ek bhedie ko hair karata he
 His suspicions are also confirmed when he gives the insider photos as proof of both of them
 vah sani se milakar samaj jaataa he ki vah bahut rasik mizaaj kaa he, jisane kai ladakiyon ko isi tarah phaansa tha
 The next day, Sunny is reported missing
 pulicekarmi unke ghar aate hai or tahakiqaat karte jisaki maamle kii cese uske garlfrand ne darj karai thi
 Simran finds those pictures of her and Sunny in Sudhir's pants, and understands that Sudhir must have done something that made Sunny go missing
 use yah baat bhi maaloom ho jaati he ki sudhir is maamle ko khatm karne ke iraade se sani ke apartment gaya tha, usne buree tarah use peeta or uske shav ko bhi dafna diya, taaki raaj bana rahe
 Simran confesses to Sudhir, confessing his mistake, and tries to take his head on charges of murdering Sunny
 apane pyaar or vishwaas ke prati vah or drudh hoti he
 On Sunny's murder, the police detain her and advocate the crime
 vahiin duusari taraf, sudhir kabool karata he ki usee ne sani kii hatya kii he
 The police get confused
 sivaay iske ki, mauka e vaardaat jagah se shav bhi gaayab rahati he
 The story takes a turn when it is known that nothing like "murder" or murder had happened at that place; All this conspiracy was hatched by Sunny with Radhika so that she can part with Simran and Sudhir, so that her love affair with Simran can be maintained
 sirf simran ko iskaa pataa chalata he, or sani ke bichhaae jaal main fasati he
 Sunny follows Simran, who runs towards the forest, where Sudhir arrives at the last moment and confronts Sunny
 vah use haraa bhi daalata he, or sani ko chhod detaa taaki vah donon ko milte jane ki ve abbhi ek-duusare se pyaar karte hai
 But then, Sunny used to attack Shudhir with a shovel that the police officers who reached the spot shoot him

 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Pythagorean theorem
 pithagoras prameya eucalidia jyamiti main kisi samakon tribhuj ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek sambandh bataane vaala prameya he
 This theorem is usually expressed as an equation in the following way- jahaan c samakon tribhuj ke karn kii lambaai he tathaa a or b anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai he
 Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician
 paramparanusaar unhen hi is prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, haalanki yah mana jane laga he ki is prameya kii jaankaree unase purv tithi kii he
 This theorem is given in the ancient Indian Buddhist Buddhist Shulbasutra
 kaaphi pramaan he ki babylon ke ganitagyon bhi is siddhant ko jaanate the
 It is also called 'boudhayan-pythagoras theorem'
 agar ham karn kii lambaai ko c or anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai ko a or b lete hai, to prameya ko nimnlikhit sameekaran ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: or, yadi c pehle se diya gaya he or ek bhujaa kii lambaai nikaalnaa ho, to nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he : or yah sameekaran samakon trikon ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek saral sambandh pradaan karata he
 The generalization of this theorem is called the 'cosine rule', with the help of which the length of the third side of any triangle can be calculated if the length of the remaining two sides and the angle between them is measured
 yah ek aisa prameya he jiske anya pramayon kii tulana main sambhavtah sarvaadhik pramaan gyaat hai 
 In the book Pythagorean Theorem, composed by Elisha Scott Loomis, 367 evidences are given
 boudhayan prameya ke adhikansh pramaanon kii tarah, yah do samroop tribhujon kii bhujaaon ke samaanupati hone ke gun par aadhaarit he
 Let ABC be a right angled triangle, in which angle c is right angled, as shown in the figure
 ham c bindu se karn par lamb daalate hai or bhujaa AB ke saath us lamb kii lambaai h hai
 This new triangle ACH is similar to our triangle ABC, because they both have right angles and a is their angle
 iskaa matlab he kii teesraa kone bhi donon tribhujon main samaan he
 On this basis, triangle CBH is also similar to ABC
 in samarupataaon se hamen do samaanupaat praapt hote hai: like tathaa They can also be written as in do samikarnon kaa sankshep karne par, In other words, the Boudhayan theorem: euclid ke tatwon main, pustak 1 kaa prastaav 47, boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit linon ke saath ek tark se sabit hota he
 A, B, c are considered the vertices of the right triangle, in which the right angle will be on A
 Drop a perpendicular from a to Karna opposite the square at the hypotenuse
 The line divides the square at the hypotenuse into two imports, each having the same area as one of the two legs being square
 aupchaarik pramaan ke liye, hamen chaar praathmik lemmata kii aavashyaktaa he: The simple idea behind this proof, which can make it easy to follow, is that the two squares above are transformed into a parallelogram of the same size, then folded and the left and right rectangles are converted to the lower squares, then continuous
 In area
 pramaan nimnanusaar he: This proof appears in Euclid's Elements as Proposition 1
47
 james e
 garfield ko ek upanyaas bijiy pramaan dwaara shrey diya gaya he: The entire trapezium is half of the left square, so its area = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 trikon 1 or trikon 2 prayek kshetrafal ab / 2 he
 The area of triangle 3 is c2 / 2 and it is half of the square on the hypotenuse
 lekin trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal bhi = - Hence the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 is pramaan main, karn par varg plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan ko anya do parshvon main virgon ke rup main jod sakate hai plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan
yah pramaan china se darj kii gai he
 From Euclid's proof diagram above, we can see three identical figures, each with a "triangle over a square"
 kyunki bada trikon do chote trikon se bana he, uskaa kshetrafal in do chote kaa jod he
 By analogy, the three squares are in the same ratio with each other as the three triangles and the area of the larger square is the sum of the area of the two smaller squares
 viparyay se pramaan ko chithran or anemeshan ke dwaara diya gaya he
 In this example, the area of each large square is 2
 donon main, charon samaan trikon kaa kshetrafal hataa diya gaya he
 The remaining regions, a2 + b2 and c2, are equal
 Q
E
D This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not preliminary, in the sense that it does not depend only on the most basic theory and theorems of Euclidean geometry

 In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem
 In fact, this difficulty affects all simple field-involved Euclidean proofs; For example, to get the area of a right-angled triangle involves an assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle of the same height and plane
 isi kaaran se, jyamiti ke liye swayansiddh parichay aam taur par trikon kii samanta ke aadhaar par ek or pramaan kaa prayog karata he 
 In the third graphic illustration of this Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse fits the square of the sides
 ek sambandhit pramaan yah dikhaa saktaa he kii punah sthapit bhaag mul ke samaan hai or, kyunki samaan kaa jod samaan he, kii unke kshetra bhi samaan hai
 To show that a square is the result, we have to show the length of the new sides equal to c
 Note that for this proof to work, we need to handle the way to cut a smaller square into more parts
 As the sides become smaller and smaller
 is pramaan kaa bijiy bhinnrup nimna tark dwaara pradaan kiya gaya he
 Looking at the illustration which is a large square with equal right-angled triangles at the corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle with C
 in trikon ke A-parshv kone or B-parshv kone anupoorak kone hai, nile kshetra ke prayek kone samakon hai, is kshetra ko ek varg banaate hue jiske parshv kii lambaai c he
 The area of this square is C2
 In this way the area of the whole is given: haalanki, bade varg ke parshvon kii lambaai a + B, ham uske kshetrafal kii gananaa kar sakate hai jaise 2, jo A2 + 2AB + B2 main vistaarit hota he
 The Buddhist theorem can be arrived at by studying the following diagram of how a lateral change can produce a change in the hypotenuse and using a small algorithm
 parshv a ke da main parivartan ke parinaam swarup, For a change in the similarity and difference of a triangle
 char ke viyojan par
 The result is the addition of a second term to the change in side b
 samekit detaa he When a = 0 then c = b, then b2 is "continuous"
 isliye As can be seen, this square is due to the special ratio between the changes and the sides, whereas the independent contribution of changes to the sides is the result of an amount that is not clear from geometric proofs
 is die gaye anupaat se yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he kii parshvon main parivartan parshvon se pratipanupati anupaat hai
 This differential equation suggests that this theorem is due to the related transform and its derivation is almost identical to the line integral computation
 yah maatra da or dc kramshah a or c main atyant chote parivartan hai
 But we use the real numbers Δa and Δc instead, then the ratio of their ratio is da / dc when their size is zero proximity, derivative and c / a are also close, the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangle and the result of the differential equation
 It shows
 is prameya kaa viparyaay bhi sach he: For any three positive numbers a, b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle whose sides are a, b and c and every triangle has a right angle between the sides whose lengths are a and b
 yah viparyaay euclid ke tatwon main maujuud hota he
 This can be proved by using the cosine method, or by the following proof: ABC ko ek trikon maanate hai jiske parshvon kii lambaai a, b or c he, a2 + b2 = c2 ke saath
hamen yah sabit karnaa he ki a or b parshvon ke bich ke kone samakon he
 We construct another triangle in which there is a right angle between the sides whose length is a and b
 paaythagorian prameya se, nimnanusaar he ki is trikon ke karn lambaai bhi c he
 Since the sides of the two triangles have the same length, a, b and c, they are congruent and therefore must have the same angle
 Therefore, the sides that have length a and b in our original triangle have a right angle between them
 paaythagorian prameya ke viparyaay kaa ek anumaan he kii nirdhaaran karne kaa ek saral tarika he kii yadi ek trikon samakon, obtyus, yaa acute he, is prakaar se
jahaan c ko teenon parshvon main lanbaa chunaa gaya he: a Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b and c, such as a2 + b2 = c2
 In other words, a Pythagorean triple describes the length of the sides of a right angle where the integer length of all three sides is

 Such triples are commonly written
 Some famous examples are and ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , One of the results of the Pythagorean theorem is that the unstructured length, such as the square root of 2, can be constructed

 The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem
 agar or chauras main ank hai, to unke bich kii duuri, jise yucalidian duuri bhi kaha jaataa he, jo diya jaataa he More generally, the Euclidean n-difference, the Euclidean distance between two points, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ , = \ ,} and a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ , = \ ,}, the Pythagorean theorem Is defined, using: euclid ke tatwon main boudhayan prameya ko saamanyakrit kiya gaya tha: If one erects a similar figure on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the two smaller ones is equal to the area of the larger
 boudhayan prameya, parshvon kii lambaai se sambandhit adhik saamaanya prameya kaa ek vishesh cese he, kosine kii vidhi: If two vectors v and w are given in this complex inner product space, then the Buddhism theorem takes the following form: vishesh rup se,||v + w||2 =||v||2 +||w||2 agar v or w ayty hai, haalanki viparyaay kaa sach hona zaruri nahin he
 Using mathematical induction, the previous result can be extended to a rectangular vector in a finite number of pairs

 v1, v2,


, consider vn to be a vector in an inner product space containing = 0 when 1 ≤ i γ
 isliye, a2 + b2 > c2 hota he
 Triangles that have an obtuse angle have α + β <γ
 isliye, a2 + b2 < c2 hota he
 Edsjar Dijkstra calls this proposal about the Akyut, right-angled and obtuse triangles in this language: jahaan kone α parshv a ke vipareet he, kone β parshv b ke vipareet he or kone γ parshv c ke vipareet he
 The theory of Euclidean geometry derives from the Pythagorean theorem, in fact, the Euclidean type of the Pythagorean theorem stated above does not occur without Euclidean geometry
 swasiddh ke baraabar dikhaaya gaya he
 ) For example, in spherical geometry, the length of the three sides of a right-angled triangle of unit area limited by octet is equal to π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2}; Euclidean violates the Pythagorean theorem because π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} iskaa matlab he kii bina yucalidian prameya main, paaythagorian prameya ko yucalidian prameya se ek alag rup lenaa chahie

 Using the mclaurin series for this cosine function, it can be shown that the radius r reaches infinity, as it is, the spherical form of the Pythagorean theorem approaches the Euclidean form

 The Pythagoras formula is used to find the distance between two digits in a Cartesian coordinate plane and is valid if all the coordinates are real: digits {2 + 2)
 But with complex coordinates: examples, digits {and {i The distance between, 0} will remain zero, which results in redactio ad Absurdum
 This is because this formula relies on the theorem of Pythagoras, which in his Huss proofs, depends on the area
 Is su and the area depends on the triangle and on other geometric figures that separate the inside from outside, which would not have been possible if the coordinates were complex
