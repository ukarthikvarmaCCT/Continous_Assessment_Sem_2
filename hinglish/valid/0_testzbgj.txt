 See the main article Jan Lokpal Bill Movement jan lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan ke liye jari yah andolan apane akhil bhartiya swaroop main 5 april 2011 ko samajasevi anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ke jantar-mantar par shuru kiye gaye anshan ke saath aarambh hua, jinamein magsese puraskaar vijeta arvind kejariwal, bharat kii pehali mahila prashasnic adhikari kiran bedi, prasiddh lokdharmee vakil prashanth bhushan, aadi shaamil the
 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 16 agast ko subah saadhe saat baje jab ve anshan par jane ke liye taiyaari kar rahe the, tab dilli police ne unhen ghar se hi giraftaar kar liya
 Other people on his team were also arrested

 The Delhi Police issued an order to release Anna conditionally

 Thousands camped outside Tihar Jail in Delhi
 17 agast kii shaam tak dilli police ramlila maidan main 7 dinon tak anshan karne kii ijaajat dene ko taiyaar hui
 But Anna refused permission to fast for less than 30 days
 unhone jail main hi apana anshan jari rakhaa
 Anna got permission for 15 days at Ramlila Maidan and from August 19, Anna Ram was determined to continue his fast for Jan Lokpal Bill at Leela Maidan
 24 agast tak teen muddon par sarkaar se sahmati nahin ban paayi
 Even after 10 days of fasting, the government could not get Anna's fast to end
 Hazare publicly announced three conditions to end his fast from ten days
 unka kahana tha ki tamaam sarkari karmchaariyon ko lokapal ke daayre main laayaa jaae, tamaam sarkari karyaalayon main ek naagarik charter lagaaya jaae or sabhi rajyon main lokayukta ho
 The 74-year-old Hazare said that he will end his fast if Parliament discusses the Jan Lokpal Bill and agrees within the House on these three conditions
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne dono pakshon ke bich jari gatirodh ko todane kii disha main pehali thos pahal karte hue loksabhaa main khuli peshkash kii ki sansad aruna raay or dow jaiprakash narayan sahit anya logon dwaara pesh vidheyakon ke saath jan lokapal vidheyak par bhi vichaar karegi
 The details of the discussion will then be sent to the standing committee
 25 may 2012 ko anna hajaare ne punah jantar mantar par jan lokapal vidheyak or visal blor vidheyak ko lekar ek din kaa sankethik anshan kiya
 Gandhi's legacy is his position
 kad-lathi main vah saadhaaran hi hai
 There is a Gandhi cap on the head and Khadi on the body
 aankhon par motaa chashma he, lekin unako dur tak dikhataa he
 The intentions are Fauladi and Atal
 mahatma gandhi ke baad anna hajaare ne hi bhukh hadtaal or aamaran anshan ko sabase zyada baar bataur hathiyaar istemaal kiya he
 Through this, they have forced the corrupt administration to step down and the governments to enact public beneficial laws
 anna hajaare ko aadhunik yug kaa gandhi bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Anna Hazare is ideal for all of us
 anna hajaare gandhiji ke gram swarajya ko bharat ke gaanvon kii samruddhi kaa madhyam maanate hai
 They believe that 'villages must stand on their feet for a strong India'
 ' unke anusaar vikaas kaa laabh samaan rup se vitarit na ho paane kaa kaaran gaanvon ko kendra main na rakhana rahaa
 From the person building to village building and then naturally he showed Gandhi's mantra of country building into reality and his campaign started from one village to 85 villages successfully today
 vyakti nirmaan ke liye mul mantra dete hue unhone yuvaaon main uttam charitra, shuddh aachaar-vichaar, nishkalank jivan va tyaag kii bhaavana viksit karne va nirbhayata ko aatmsaat kar aam aadmi kii seva ko adarsh ke rup main sweekaar karne kaa aahvaan kiya he
 Hasiya Kot is a village in Chamoli district of Garhwal division under the state of Uttarakhand, in Garasain tehsil of India
 saamaajik sandarbhon main samanta kaa arth kisi samaaj kii us sthiti se he jisamen us samaaj ke sabhi log samaan adhikaar yaa pratishtha rakhte hai
 For social equality, 'equal rights before the law' is a minimum requirement under which security, voting rights, freedom of speech, freedom to gather, property rights, equal access to social goods and services etc
 saamaajik samanta main swasthya samanta, aarthik samanta, tathaa anya saamaajik suraksha bhi aatin hai
 Apart from this, equal opportunity and equal responsibility also comes under it
 saamaajik samanta kisi samaaj kii vah avasthaa he jiske antargat us samaaj ke sabhi vyaktiyon ko saamaajik aadhaar par samaan mahatv praapt ho
 The concept of equality is rooted in the core of normative political theory
 yah ek aisa vichaar he jiske aadhaar par karodon-karodon log sadiyon se nirankush shaskaon, anyaaypurna samaaj vyavasthaaon or aloktantric hukuumaton yaa nitiyon ke kilaaf sangharsh karte rahe hai or karte rahenge
 In this sense, equality is placed in the category of permanent and universal concepts
 do yaa do se adhik logon yaa samoohon ke bich sambandh kii ek sthiti aisi hoti he jise samanta ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, equality as an idea is not so easy and simple, as there is always more than one way to define that relationship, set its goals, and prioritize one aspect of it over another
 alag-alag tareeke akhriyaar karne par samanta ke vichaar kii bhinn-bhinn paribhaashaayen ubhartee hai
 From the ancient Greek civilization to the twentieth century, there have been many drastic changes in the design of this idea
 bahut se chintakon ne iske vikaas or isamen hui tabdiliyon main yogadan kiya he jinamein arestu, hobbs, ruso, marks or tokvil pramukh hai
 Equality is a somewhat modern concept
 aaj maanav-samaaj aadmi-aadmi ke bich jis tarah samanta kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karata he us tarah usne hameshaa mahasoos nahin kiya he
 In the western world, kings were considered to have the divine right to rule, and so was the extent of their respective regions with regard to the feudal lords
 udhar padri-purohit yah maanate the ki jaise sarvajna ve hai vaisaa koi or ho hi nahin saktaa
 In the Greek period, limited and very weak attempts were made to establish equality
 aakhirkaar satrahavin sadi main europe main adhikaron or swatantraaa kii maang uthne lagi or atharahavin tathaa unnisvin sadiyon main samanta kii maang kii gai
 Initially this demand was made by the neo-rich people or bourgeoisie among the traders and businessmen who said that when they have property and economic status along with the feudal lords and kings, why is their legal status not equal to them
 udhaaharan ke liye touni ke shabdon main england main vastu-sthiti nimnlikhit dhang kii thiah 'since inequalities were not the most economic, but legal inequalities, legal inequality, rather than property inequality, was first attacked
 


 sudhaarkon kaa praathmik lakshya kanoonee samanta praapt karnaa tha, kyonki aisa samajha gaya ki uske praapt ho jane ke baad aarthik samanta vaanchit seemaa tak swatah hi sthapit ho jaaegi
 ' isi prakaar france main mudda aarthik samanta nahin, balki kanoonee adhikaar tha or samanta ke liye kiye gaye sangharsh ne ‘sampatti par aadhaarit nae abhijaat varg ko bhoomi par aadhaarit puraane abhijaat varg kii barabari ke str par pratishthit kar diya
 ' atharahavin sadi main mukhya rup se kanoonee or raajnneetik samanta ke liye aawaaj uthaai gai or aakhirkaar unnisvin sadi main nae shramik varg ke udai ke parinamswaroop samazorthik samanta ke liye adhik joardaar maang kii gai
 In the nineteenth century, the growing move of clean capitalism created wealth for some families on the one hand, but on the other hand led to huge poverty and economic inequality
 isliye aarthik samanta ke liye maang uthi or yah kaam kiya maanavtaavaadiyon ne, adarshavaadi samaajwaadiyon ne or sakaaratmak udaarvaadiyon ne
 This demand for economic equality was not for negative political and legal equality, but for positive equality and included curbs on private property, prohibition of exploitation of the poor by the rich and meant the state in terms of the overall economic system of society
 Positive role of
 samanta ke liye chalane vaale sangharsh main ek bahut hi ahm mile kaa pathar beesvin sadi ke purvardhdh main mahila matadhikaarwaadiyon jiske prayatnon ke falswaroop mahilaon ko matadhikaar diya janaa tha
 The freedom movement of the colonies like India flourished in the same century to gain freedom from imperialist powers like Britain, which gave further impetus to the journey of equality
 yunaan ke nagar-rajyon, jaise athens or sparta main raaj-kaaj ke kaamon main prayek naagarik kii awaz kaa samaan mulya samajha jaataa tha
 Aristotle's Athenian Constitution finds many references to egalitarian reforms on the basis of which the democratic ideal could be tried
 in sudhaaron kaa makasad tha saamaajik jivan ke vibhinn kshetron main vishmataaon ko ghataana taaki bhu-swaamitv, satta or saamaajik gaurav par kulinon or saamanton kii jakad dhili ho sake
 The practice of equality on the basis of law was the criterion on which democracy could be tightened
 lekin, pracheen athens main is samtamulak daayre se striyon, daason or videshiyon ko alag bhi rakhaa gaya tha
 Aristotle's creation in politics has also mentioned this exclusion and justified it
 unke liye samanta kaa arth tha us varg ke sadasyon kii samanta jise naagarik kaha jaataa tha
 They considered justice available only to those who came under the purview of their equality
 jo usase baahar the, unke liye vishmata kii sthiti hi nyaaypurna thi
 Aristotle's basic belief was that nature created people by dividing them into rulers and ruled
 shaasha kii shrenee main hone ke liye vyakti main buddhisangat, vichaaratmak or adhikarpurnataa kii kuubiyaan hona anivaary he
 He also believed that these qualities separate the ruler from the ruled
 arestu kii samanta kii dharna kii aalochana karte hue hobbs ne apane granth levaythan main prakrut avasthaa kii sankalpana karke uske tahat har vyakti ko samaan tehraaya
 Even if a person is better than others in physical strength or in some mental quickness, on the whole there is no such difference between humans on the basis of which they can demand any special benefit
 hobbs kaa tark tha ki jo jism ke lihaaz se kamazor he, vah taqatvar ko yojana bana kar maar saktaa he or mastishk ke str par anubhav ke zariye har vyakti samaan samaj vivek hasil karne kii kshamta se sampann hota he
 Simultaneously, human beings also have the same aspiration to gain power, which leads to competition between them and the natural equality becomes risky
 hobbs kii manyata thi ki apni satta ke ek hisse ko raajnneetik praadhikaar ke liye chhod kar hi vyakti ek sabhy or samtamulak jivan guzaar saktaa he
 That is, the dominance of a certain authority can only assure him of complete security
 hobbs maanate the ki dharm samet har prakaar ke gair- raajnneetik praadhikaron se mukti ke zariye hi vyakti ko uski prakritik samanta uplabdh ho sakati he
 Rousseau also conceives a natural state of his own
 unhone apane duusare discorse main samanta ke bajaay vishmata par vichaar karte hue use prakritik or aprakritik main baanta he
 Natural asymmetry occurs only in the field of physical strength
 lekin, vidhi nirmaan or sampatti ke swaamitv ne vishmata ke aprakritik roopon ko janm diya he
 Actually, this is the first level of asymmetry that has created the difference between the poor and the rich
 doosraa str dand dene kaa sansthagat adhikaar he jisase shaktishaalee or durbal kii asamanta paidaa hui
 The last level of inequality has arisen from the conversion of legitimate authority into voluntary power, which has created the categories of slave and master
 sampatti ke swami satta jamaa karke maalik ban jate hai or garib durbal hote hue daasatv main pad jate hai
 According to Rousseau, this disparity also has a limit
 jab vishmata main vruddhi sambhav nahin rah jaati to nayi krantiyaan yaa to huku ̧maton ko nasht kar detii hai yaa unhen satta kii vaid sansthaaon ke nazadik aana padataa he
 Marx developed his idea of equality as a critique of liberal equality
 ve maanate the ki poonjeewaadi varg samanta ke vichaar kaa apane hit main istemaal karata he
 Just as Rousseau used to say that the poor get ready to legalize their power by being trapped under the false assurances of the rich, Marx says that the ruling class produces its ideology so that the system of economic exploitation can be continued 
 poonjeewaadi varg ke bheetar ek tarah kaa kaary-vibhaajan hota he
 One part takes ownership of the capital and the other maintains an atmosphere of confusion through ideas of equality and freedom using ideological tools
 marks ke anusaar samantshahi main jo sthaan gaurav or nishtha jaise vichaaron kaa tha, vahi sthaan poonjeewaad main samanta or swadhinata kaa he
 The efficacy of these abstract ideas is so high that some socialists also get caught in their clutches
 lekin, ye vichaar us samay tak khokhale or tatvaheen hai jab tak unamem samyavaadee drushti kaa samavesh na ho
 According to Marx, exploitative class relations cannot be established without the end
 iske liye ve pehle samaajawaadee charan kii sankalpana karte hai jo har ek ko uske shram ke mutabik dene par aadhaarit hoga
 The second phase will be communist in which the basis of giving each one according to his capacity and each according to his ability will be taken
 america loktantric kranti kii jaanch-padtaal karte hue tokvil samanta kaa adhyayan aadhunik itihaas kii pramukh pravriti ke rup main karte hai
 Through the American example, he wanted to understand how Western society has transitioned from feudalism to democracy
 ve is sawaal kaa jawaab khojate hai ki is prakriya main samanta kii vijay kyon aprihaary he? saamaajik samanta uttarottar kyon viksit hoti chali jaaegi? tokvil kaa kahana he ki samantshahi kisaan se lekar raja tak ek lambi shrunkhlaa banaati chali jaati he
 But democracy breaks it and frees every link in the chain
 daastaa or nirbharta kii jakad se nikalne kii ichha samanta ke vichaar main logon kii ruchi badhaati he or is prakaar loktantric jivan kii sambhaavna paidaa hoti he
 According to Talkweil, in democracies, the person holds equality and his flag firmly, giving priority to equality
 samanta ke vichaar kii in nishpattiyon ke baad is prashn par gaur karnaa zaruri he ki akhir samanta or samarupata main kya fark he
 Not every student appearing in the exam can be given equal marks
 parivaar ke aakaar kaa dhyaan na rakhte hue har ek ko samaan ghar abantit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Not every person's income can be equalized, bypassing talent and ability
 isliye samanta kii upyukt kasuti samarupata ke bajaay kuch or honi chahie
 However, on the other hand, the importance of symmetry emerges for equitable processes
 samanta laane kii prakriyaayein tabhi nyaaypurna ho sakati hai jab ve sabhi ke liye samroop hon, jaise avasaron kii samanta, kanoon kii nigaah main sabko samaan samajhnaa, aadi
 It is difficult to define equality
 yah murtt kii apeksha bahut adhik amurtt he
 Most people unconsciously relate it to the expressions that are conveyed with the words 'same', 'same', 'justified' etc

 laski kaa kahana he, ‘raajnneeti vigyaan ke puure kshetra main koi bhi vichaar’ samanta se ‘adhik kathin nahin he
 ' ruso prakritik or paaramparik asamantaaon main bhed karte the
 Nature-provided inequalities are traditional inequalities
 samaajwaadiyon or marxvaadiyon kaa kahana he ki paaramparik asamantaaon, khaastaur se paaramparik aarthik asamantaaon main itani shakti hoti he ki ve tamaam prakritik asamantaaon ko dhak detii hai
 Marx says: sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee sakaaratmak chintak laski ne samanta ke liye nimnlikhit sthitiyon ko aavashyak batayah Recently Brian Vernon has proposed a comprehensive concept of equality, suggesting that equality should consist of the following component concepts: kanoonee samanta kaa matlab he kanoon ke saamne samanta or sabake liye kanoon kii samaan suraksha
 The concept is that all human beings are equal from birth, so they deserve equal status before the law
 kanoon andhaa hota he or isliye vah jis vyakti se nibat rahaa he uske saath koi murauvat nahin karegaa
 Be it wise or foolish, brilliant, or foolish, short or tall, poor or rich, the law will treat him the same way as others
 lekin upwaad bhi hai
 For example, a child or girl will not be treated like an adult man or woman and the child or girl will be defended
 raajnneetik swatantraaa kaa matlab buniyadi taur par saarvajaneen matadhikaar or pratinidhik sarkaar he
 Public suffrage means that all adults have the right to vote and one person has the same vote
 pratinidhik sarkaar kaa arth yah he ki sabhi ko bina kisi bhedbhaav ke chunaav main spardhaa main khadey hone kaa adhikaar he or vah saarvajanik seva ke liye chunaav main khadaa hota he
 But this does not mean that everyone can be forced to vote and everyone has to express their choice or if some people are dissuaded from voting with the wrong impression or whether they agree to vote
 If the tax is done then the state cannot do much about it and if most people or a large number of people do not vote and thus weaken the representative form of government If we do not, according to the pure liberal understanding of political equality, political inequality of any kind cannot be accused
 maatr takneekee taur yaa sanvaidhanik rup se guarantee kii gai raajnneetik samanta kaa matlab bhi sachhee raajnneetik samanta nahin hoti, kyonki dekha gaya he ki pramukh udaaravaadi loktantron main paise kii takat ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaati he
 If people, groups or classes who have this power are ready to use it then it helps them so much in advancing their political interests that it is difficult to cut it
 is prakaar akele paise kii takat aamtaur par aksar chunaavon ke parinaamon ko niyantrit karne main bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Not only the money spent by the candidates and the parties, but the entire system of money connection helps in this
 prachaar madhyam aajkal ke udaaravaadi loktantron main or khaas kar is tarah ke jin loktantron main bahut bade madhya varg kaa astitv he unamem bahut badi bhoomika nibhaate hai or yadhyapi in madhyamon ko swatantra mana jaataa he lekin vastav main ve swatantra ho nahin sakate, kyonki ve apane aarthik astitv or phalne-phoolne ke liye mukhya rup se companiyon ke vigyapanon par nirbhar hote hai or unke liye vyavsaay jagat kii raajnneetik samvedansheeltaaon or hiton tathaa companiyon kii kaary-suchi ke prati samvedansheel hona jaruri hota he
 To the extent that publicity media affects people, to the extent that these agenda lists are communicated to them, whether or not they undertake this work under a thoughtful plan, or their compulsion behind it
 
 is prakaar inkaa antim parinaam raajnneetik samanta ke str kii us samtaltaa ko bhang kar detaa he jo anyathaa vyavahaaratah kaayam rahati
 Apart from what has been said above, in a democracy like India, there are powerful executive bureaucrats and members of the judicial services, who are not selected by the public like politicians and if people are fed up with them, then there is no election to expel them
 apni shaikshik tathaa paariwarik prishthbhumi ke kaaran in samoohon ke sadsy aksar upree aarthik tabakon or virgon se aate hai or niti-nirdhaaran ko anwarat or prabal rup se prabhavit karte rahete hai
 Clearly, these groups consume more political equality than others
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ucchtam nyaayalay kaa koi nyaayadhish sarkaar ke kisi nitigat vidhaan par roak laga detaa he or use gaiyr-kanoonee ghoshit kar detaa he haalanki us vidhaan kii rachana swatantra or saaf-suthere chunaav main nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ne, chaahe ve jitne ashikshit yaa shaikshit drushti se yogyatahin hon, kii he
 The judge is not legally, but has a purely political view, clearly enjoying a position of greater equality than his other fellow citizens
 aarthik or saamaajik samanta kii abhidharana kaa arth alag-alag logon ke liye alag-alag he
 Early equality with economic equality simply meant that every person, regardless of their family or economic status, had the right to choose their occupation and occupation and that every person was at liberty to contract, so far as contractual obligations were concerned
 , So that every person of the country should be treated equally
 dhire-dhire sthiti is abhidharana kii disha main badalane lagi ki prayek ko purna maanav praani ke rup main jeene kaa samaan avasar praapt ho
 Gradually it was understood and accepted that equality should mean that no one in the society should be so poor that they do not have the means to fulfill the basic needs and do not have primary opportunities for mental and physical development
 
 ruso ke shabdon main kahen to ‘samanta se hamaara matlab yah nahin hona chahie prayek vyakti ko bilkul barabari kii satta or dhan praapt hona chahie, balki uskaa matlab yah hona chahie ki koi bhi naagarik itnaa dhanwaan na ho ki vah dusron ko kharid le or kisi bhi naagarik ko itnaa nirdhan na hona chahie ki vah bikne ke liye majaboor ho jaae

 laski ne aarthik samanta kii sakaaratmak udaaravaadi abhidharana ko parishkrut rup pradaan kiya or samanta kaa arth jinke bina jivan nirarthak he un sabhi chizon kii uplabdhta karaayi
 He said that the basic necessities should be accessible to all without any distinction of magnitude and variety
 sabhi manushyon ko aavashyak bhojan or awaas sulabh hona chahie
 He considered the fulfillment of basic needs as a precondition of equality of opportunity and advocated reducing the excess of economic inequality for that economic equality
 samanta-sambandhi marxvaadi drushti samanta ko, visheshtah aarthik samanta ko, sampatti or varg -shoshan se jod kar dekhati he
 The truth is that even non-marxist liberal thinkers like Rousseau and Kens have also directed the relation between equality and property
 udhaaharan ke liye, kence kehete hai: ‘khanaabadosh or akhetak kabeelon jaise jin samaajon ke liye nijee sampatti kaa koi upyog nahin he unke liye samtawadi hona aasaan he lekin jo samaaj vyaktiyon ko nijee sampatti kaa sangrah karne kii suvidha dete hai unke liye yah aasaan nahin hota
 'equality in Marxist analysis can only be achieved by eradicating classes or class-divided societies, and full attainment is possible only through the abolition of private property
 marxvaadi vichaar aisa samaaj sthapit karne kaa he jisamen koi nijee sampatti yaa aarthik varg nahin honge or prayek ko ‘yogyatanusaar kaam or aavashyaktaanusaar daam’ ke siddhant ke mutabik jo dena he so diya jayega
 The distribution work is of the state
 lenin or anya marxvaadi is sakaaratmak udaaravaadi abhidharana par prahaar karte hai ki rajya ke hastkshep se aarthik asamantaayein mitaai ja sakati hai or jivan ke liye buniyadi aavashyaktaaon kii vastuon kii sulabhta sabake liye sunishchit kii ja sakati he, kyonki unka maananaa he ki yadi nijee sampatti kaa unmoolan nahin kiya jaataa he to upree virgon kii paise kii takat ke kaaran shoshan or asamantaayein aahiste se phir laut aayengi
 Social equality means the absence of discrimination on the basis of color, gender, race, sexual orientation, etc
 Unlike the legal, political and economic aspects of equality, it has been felt for years that the discrimination of the rest is something Political and legal rights that have existed in societies for thousands of years are difficult to weaken even on the strength of economic progress and rapid progress of eradication of economic inequalities
