 Pandit Chandrashekhar Azad, the true heir of Bismil absconding from Kakori Kand, along with the young revolutionary Bhagat Singh revived the party by holding a secret meeting at Ferozeshah Kotla ground in Delhi and gave the organization a new name Hindustan Socialist Republican Association

 "during the struggle between Mrs
 Gandhi and her rivals, the central Congress leadership for succession after 1965, many states and state congress organizations were forced to remove upper-caste leaders and replace the backward castes to collect votes of those castes
 So that their opposition and opponents in the state Congress can be defeated
 , Some of which may be considered appropriate socially progressive achievements, however, often lead to intensifying inter-ethnic regional conflicts

 This step had alienated India from the first world and Prime Minister Gandhi has now rapidly given a new direction to a pre-cautious national security and foreign policy

 However, Gandhi was now a national nuclear program in view of the nuclear threat from the People's Republic of China and the interest in the interference of two major superpowers not felt conducive to India's stability and security
 unhone naye pakistani raashtrapati zulfikaar ali bhutto ko ek saptaah tak chalanevaali shimla shikhar vaarta main aamantrit kiya tha
 Approaching the failure of the talks, the two heads of state eventually signed the Simla Agreement, under which the two countries contracted to negotiate and peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute

 In the early 1960s, the organized Green Revolution was the informal name for the intensive agriculture district program, under which the people of the cities, on whose support Gandhi was, in fact, deeply dependent on all Indian politicians, abound Cheap grain was guaranteed
 yah kaarykram chaar charnon par aadhaarit tha: This program, which lasted for ten years, eventually led to a threefold increase in wheat production and a small but attractive increase in rice; While there was little or no growth in cereals such as barley, gram and coarse cereals - still a relatively stable yield remained in these areas

 The internal structure of the Congress Party, weakened as a result of its numerous divisions, became entirely dependent on his leadership in determining the fate of elections
 gandhi kaa san 1971 kii taiyaari main naare kaa vishay tha garibi hataao
 This slogan and the blueprint of the proposed Poverty Hatao program, which came with it, were designed to give Gandhi an independent national support based on the rural and urban poor
 is tarah unhen pramukh gramin jatiyon ke dabadabe main rahe rajya or sthaneey sarkaron evam shahari vyapaaree varg ko andekha karne kii anumati rahi thi
 And, the share of the poor who remained unimpressed in the past, at least both the political value and the political weight, increased

 Gandhi had already been accused of authoritarian conduct
 unki majboot sansadeey bahumat kaa vyavhaar kar, unki sattarudh bhartiya rashtriya congress ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar kendra or rajyon ke bich ke satta santulan ko badal diya tha
 He twice declared states ruled by opposition parties as "lawless and chaotic" and took control of them by imposing President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution

 Some anti-social elements complained to Akbar Badshah about the editing of the Granth Sahib that the scripture was written against Islam, but later when Akbar came to know the greatness of speech, he made 51 pieces through Bhai Gurdas and Baba Budha Grieved by offering jahangir ne lahore jo kii ab pakistan main he, main 16 june 1606 ko atyant yatnaa dekar unki hatya karvaa di

 vidhi praayah bhaleebhanti likhi hui sansuchakon ke rup main hoti he
 Law is very important for running the society in a proper manner
 vidhi manushya kaa aacharan ke ve saamaanya niyam hote he jo rajya dwaara sweekrut tathaa lagu kiye jate he, jinka paalan anivarya hota he
 The judiciary punishes for non-compliance
 kanoonee pranali kai tarah ke adhikaron or jimmedaariyon ko vistaar se bataati he
 The word law itself seems to be a word associated with the creator
 aadhyatmik jagat main 'vidhi ke vidhaan' kaa aashay 'vidhaataa dwaara banaaye hue kanoon' se he
 It is a law made by the life and death creator or can be called the law of law
 saamaanya rup se vidhaataa kaa kanoon, prakruti kaa kanoon, jeev-jagat kaa kanoon evam samaaj kaa kanoon
 Today the whole world is being affected by the state-made law
 raajnneeti aaj samaaj kaa anivaary ang ho gaya he
 Every organism of the society is governed by laws
 aaj samaaj main bhi vidhi ke shashan ke naam par duniya bhar main sarkarein nagarikon ke liye vidhi kaa nirmaan karti he
 The purpose of law is to regulate the conduct of society
 adhikaar evam dayitvon ke liye spasht vyakhya karnaa bhi he saath hi samaaj main ho rahe anaikatik kaary yaa lokaneeti ke viruddh hone vaale kaaryo ko aparaadh ghoshit karke aparaadhiyon main bhay paidaa karnaa bhi aparaadh vidhi kaa udeshy he
 From 1945 till today, the United Nations, through its charter or through its various relevant organizations, tried to tell the states and citizens of the world that development of society is not possible without peace but co-existence for peace and It is important not only to have a fair attitude but also to revive the conduct
 nyaaypurna samaaj main hi shanti, sadbhaav, maitri, sashastitv kaayam ho paata he
 Law means the code of rules, instructions, restrictions and entitlements governing and governing human behavior
 lekin yah bhoomika to naitik, dharmik or anya saamaajik samhitaon kii bhi hoti he
 Actually, the law differs from these codes in many ways
 pehali baat to yah he ki kanoon sarkaar dwaara banaaya jaataa he lekin samaaj main use sabhi ke upar samaan rup se lagu kiya jaataa he
 Secondly, by taking the form of 'will of the state', it takes precedence over all other social rules and standards
 tisare, kanoon anivaary hota he arthath nagarikon ko uske paalan karne ke chunaav kii swatantraaa nahin hoti
 There is a provision of punishment in law for those who do not follow
 lekin, kanoon keval dand hi nahin detaa
 It also provides rules for contracting between individuals or parties, marriage, succession, distribution of benefits and governing institutions
 kanoon sthapit saamaajik naitiktaaon kii pushti kii bhoomika bhi nibhaataa he
 Fourth, the law is 'public' in nature because it is composed of formal legislative procedures as a code of published and recognized rules
 ant main kanoon main apane anupaalan kii ek naitik baadhyataa nihit he jiske tahat ve log bhi kanoon kaa paalan karne ke liye majaboor hote hai jinhen vah anyaaypurna lagata he
 The political system, whether democratic or totalitarian, has to run on the basis of some code of law
 lekin, loktantric vyavasthaaon main badalte samay ke saath apraasangik ho gayi yaa nyaaypurna na samajhe jane vaale kanoon ko radd karne or uski jagah nayaa behatar kanoon banane kii maang karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 a notable role of law is also believed to be to educate citizens to run the society in an organized style
 shuruyaat main raajnneetishastra ke centre main kanoon kaa adhyayan hi tha
 Political philosophers have been embroiled in intense debates over the question of the essence and structure of law
 kanoon ke vidwaanon ko maanavshaastra, raajnneetik arthshaastra, natikshastra or vidhaayi mulya-pranali kaa adhyayan bhi karnaa padataa he
 The notion of 'rule of law' prevails in liberal democracies operating on a constitutional basis
 in vyavasthaaon main kanoon ke daayre ke baahar koi kaam nahin karata, na vyakti or na hi sarkaar
 Behind this is the liberal principle of law according to which the purpose of law is not to impose restrictions on the person but to guarantee his freedom
 udaarataavaadi siddhant maanata he ki kanoon ke bina vyaktigat aacharan ko sanyamit karnaa naammumkin ho jayega or ek ke adhikaron ko duusare ke haathon hanan se bachaaya nahin ja sakegaa
 Thus in the language of John Locke, law means the law to protect life, liberty and property
 udaarataavaadi siddhant spasht karata he ki kanoon ke banane or lagu karne ke tareeke koun-koun se hone chahie
 For example, the law should be made through mutual consultation by elected lawmakers
 duusare, koi kanoon pichhali tarikh se lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki us surat main vah nagarikon ko un kaamon ke liye dandit karegaa jo tatkaaleen kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi the
 Similarly, liberal law is against the punishment of cruel and inhuman kind
 raajnneetik prabhaavon se nirpeksh rahane vaali ek nishpaksh nyaaypalika kii sthapana kii jaati he taaki kanoon kii vyavasthit vyakhya karte hue pakshakaron ke bich uske aadhaar par faisalaa ho sake
 Marxists believe that the concept of rule of law works in the name of guaranteeing individual freedom while protecting property rights and protecting the capitalist system
 iskaa nateeja saamaajik vishmata or vargeey prabhutv ko banaaye rakhane main nikalataa he
 Marx considers law like politics and ideology to be part of a superstructure or superstructure whose base or basis is laid on the method of capitalist production
 nariwadiyon ne bhi kanoon ke shashan kii avadharana kii aalochana kii he ki vah langik nishpakshta par aadhaarit nahin he
 That is why the judiciary and the profession of law are occupied by men
 bahusamskritwad ke pairokaron kaa tark he ki kanoon asal main prabhutvshaalee saanskrithik samoohon ke mulyon or ravaiyon kii numaaindgi hi karata he
 As a result, the values and concerns of minority and marginalized groups continue to be ignored
 kanoon or naitikta ke bich antar ke sawaal par darshanik shuru se hi sir khapate rahe hai
 The basis of law is the belief of those who believe in the moral system, in the principle of 'natural law'
 plato or unke baad arestu kii manyata thi ki kanoon or naitikta main nazadiiki rishta hota he
 a just society can only be one in which the laws affirm wisdom based on moral rules
 madhyayugin isai vichaarak thomas equina bhi maanate the ki is dharti par uttam jivan vyateet karne ke liye natural lau yani ishwar pradutt naitiktaaon ke mutabik kanoon hone chahie
 In the nineteenth century, the theory of natural law became ineffective as the prestige of rationalism and scientific outlook increased
 kanoon ko naitik, dharmik or rahasywaadee manyataon se mukt karne kii koshishen huin
 John Austin established 'legal positivism' which claimed that the law was concerned not with a higher moral or religious principle, but with a sovereign person or institution
 kanoon isliye kanoon he ki uskaa paalan karavaaya jaataa he or karnaa padataa he
 HLA is a far more practical and naive interpretation of legal positivism
 Hart's work is found in 'the Concept of Law'
 heart kanoon ko naitik niyamon ke daayre se nikaal kar maanav samaaj ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karte hai
 According to him, law is a combination of first and secondary rules
 pratham shrenee ke niyamon ko 'kanoon ke saar' kii sangya dete hue heart kehete hai ki unka sambandh saamaajik vyavhaar ke viniman se he
 Like, foreclosure law
 dwitiya shrenee ke niyam sarkari sansthaaon ko hidaayat dete hai ki kanoon kis tarah banaaya jaae, unka kis tarah karyanvayan kiya jaae, kis tarah uske aadhaar par faisale kiye jaaen or in aadhaaron par kis tarah uski vaidhata sthapit kii jaae
 The theory of legal positivism propounded by Hart has been criticized by political philosopher Ronold Dwarkin
 unke anusaar kanoon keval niyamon kii samhita hi nahin hota or na hi aadhunik vidhi pranaliyaan kanoon kii vaidhata sthapit karne ke liye kisi ek samaan tareeke kaa praavdhaan karti hai
 The debate between the law and morality also arose in the Nuremberg lawsuit punishing the atrocities of the Nazis
 prashn yah tha ki kya un kaamon ko aparaadh tehraaya ja saktaa he jo rashtriya kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi hon? iske jawaab ke liye prakritik kanoon kii avadharana kaa sahaara liya gaya, lekin uski abhivyakti maanavadhikaron kii bhashaa main hui
 Indeed, the question of the relationship between law and morality is highly complex and continues to arise in the context of issues such as abortion, prostitution, pornography, violence in TV and films, mother-of-the-womb, and genetic engineering

 An agreement was reached and his heart was buried with Emma in Stinsford, and at the Abyss Poyts Corner

 Hardy began literary service by writing poems, but he destroyed the primary works
 1870 se 1898 tak unhone kathasahitya ko samrudh kiya
 They did not see any justice or order in the operation of life and the world, according to them, a blind power used to conduct the activities of this world
 is andhi shakti ko ve 'immenent vil' kehete the - aisi chaalkalakti jo jivan or sansar main nihit he
 In his narrative Hardy intensified his attack on the world trade
 pehle upanyaason main yah apekshaakrit halkaa he
 His first available work was published in 1879, 'desperate Remedies', the second in 1872, 'under the Greenwood Tree' and in 1873 the third 'A Pair of Blue Eyes'
 agali rachana 'for fram di maiding croud' adhik praudh kriti he or iske prakaashan ke baad unki khyaati badi
 By gaining confidence, Hardy intensified his shock at the pace of the world
 is kaal kii rachanaaon main sarvshereshth hai - 'di woodlanders', 'di ritern ov di netive', 'di trumpet major' or 'di meyar ov wasterbrij'
 This was followed by two more novels in which Hardy sinks in utter despair
 aalochakon ke praharon se ghabaraakar hardi ne upanyaas likhnaa chhodkar kavita likhnaa shuru kiya
 For twenty years he wrote poetry and opened new doors of fame for himself
 kavita main bhi hardi apane vichaardarshan ko vyakt karte rahe, kintu kavitaaon main vyakt aghaton se pathak or aalochak us had tak marmaahat na hue
 Hardy said that 'if Galileo had written in the poem that the earth had turned, he might not have suffered so much
 ' kavita ko ek baar pun: apanaakar hardi apane saahitiyik jivan ke pratham prem kii ore mude the
 Meanwhile, he wrote his most important work 'the Dinasts'

 This composition is epic as drama

 Its acting is possible only on the stage of imagination

 This globalist was also a victim of cruel destiny
 jivan kii shakti kalchakra ko ghumaati rahati he or sadaachari tathaa duraachaari sabhi usamen pisate rahete hai
 Hardy's views are expressed very clearly in this composition
 hardi kaa parivaar angarezi carch ko maanata tha lekin kattar anuyaayi nahin tha

 phir bhi vah england kii sthaneey carch ke skool main nahin gaye, unhen teen mile dur shri last ke skool main bheja gaya

 Basto left for Australia, the correspondence between them continued for a long time, but Hardy eventually grew tired of this exchange and the correspondence ceased
 iske saath hi baptist ke saath hardi kaa sambandh samaapt ho gaya
 Hardy's idea of luck in life was reflected in a philosophical conflict with God
 haalanki hardi kaa vishwaas barkaraar rahaa kintu jivan kii vidambnaaon or sangharshon ke kaaran unhone parameshwar ke bare main paaramparik isai drushtikon par sawaal uthaae: There is a mixed form of agnosticism, theism and spiritualism in Hardy's religious life
 ek baar, jab ek padri ne patr dwaara pidaa kii yatnaa ko pyaar karne vaale parameshwar kii neki ke saath milaane ko kaha, hardi ne jawaab diya, Nevertheless, Hardy often thought and wrote about the supernatural forces governing the universe, doing so in an absolute sense of pleasure rather than any conviction
 iske alaava, hardi ke lekhan se kuch had tak bhuton or atmaaon ke prati unke aakarshan kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 Despite these sentiments, Hardy remained emotionally connected to Christian worship and church rituals, especially those practiced in rural communities, had a very constructive impact on him in the early years of life and saw a plethora of biblical references in many of Hardy's novels May go
 jon hiks ke yahaan shikshuta ke dauraan hardi ke doston main shaamil the horess mal or kavi wiliam barns, dono hi padri the
 Moll had been a close friend of Hardy's life and introduced him to new scientific discoveries such as Gideon Mantel, who doubted the literal interpretation of the Bible
 Moll gave Hardy a copy of Mantel's book The Wonders of Geology in 1858, with Adelene Buckland's idea that Mantel's geological description and the "cliffhanger" section of a Pair of Blue Eyes have "irrefutable similarities"
 yah suzav bhi diya gaya he ki e peyar of blue aaiz main henri nite kaa paatr horess mal par aadhaarit tha
 No publisher agreed to publish Hardy's first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady, completed in 1867, and Hardy destroyed the manuscript, so only parts of the novel are available

 Desperate Remedies and Under the Greenwood Tree were published anonymously
 hardi ke apni pehali patni ke saath pranay sambandhon par aadhaarit upanyaas e peyar of blue aaiz 1873 main unke apane naam se prakashit hua
 The emergence of the term "cliffhanger" is thought to be a serial adaptation of the story in which one hero, Henry Knight, is actually left hanging from a cliff
 hardi ne kaha ki unhone pehali baar vesex ko apane agle upanyaas faar from da maiding croud main pesh kiya
 It was so successful that Hardy gave up his work of architecture and adopted literature as his life-style

 Other novels written by Hardy include a love story based on the world of astronomy

 His novels are set against the backdrop of the fictional world of Wessex, a vast region of South and Southwest England named after the anglo-saxon state of that region
 hardi do duniyaaon kaa hissaa the
 He also had a deep emotional attachment to his childhood rural life, but also to the pulse of the era before the changes and prevailing social problems, innovations in agriculture - changes in the English countryside due to the Industrial Revolution - He was aware of the impropriety and hypocrisy of the sexual behavior of Victorian society hardi aise saamaajik bandhanon ke aalochak the jo 19veen sadi main rahane vaale logon ke jivan main baadha daalate the
 Considered a Victoria period realist, Hardy tested social bonds that are part of the Victorian status quo and believed that these bonds would disrupt the lives of all involved and ultimately lead to suffering
 tu on e tower main hardi in niyamon ke khilaaf awaz uthaate dikhaai padate hai or saamaajik sanrachana kii prishthbhumi main ek kahani rachate hai, prem kii aisi daastaan jo varg kii simaaon ko paar leti he
 The reader is forced to think of breaking the traditions established for love

 The idealism of Swithin St Cleeve makes him stand out against contemporary social bonds

 Hardy's stories consider life events and their effects

 balyogi mahakaul ko dekhakar shivaji bahut prasann hue or unhone babaaji ko kalyug tak bhakton ke bich siddh pratik ke taur se puuje jane kaa aashirvad pradaan kiya or chir aayu tak unki chhavi ko balak kii chhavi ke taur par bane rahane kaa bhi aashirvad diya
 In Kali Yuga, Baba Balaknath ji was born in Gujarat, Kathiabad under the name of "dev"
 unki mata kaa naam lakshmi or pita kaa naam vaishno vaish tha, bachapan se hi babaaji ‘aadhyatm’ main leen rahete the
 Seeing this, his parents decided to marry him, but Babaji rejected his proposal and left the family and set out on the path of 'param Siddhi'
 or ek din junagarh kii girnaar pahari main unka saamana “swami dattatreya” se hua or yaheen par babaaji ne swami dattatreya se “ siddh” kii buniyadi shiksha grahan kari or “siddh” bane
 Since then, he came to be called "baba Balaknathji"
 babaaji ke do pruthk sakshya abhi bhi uplabdh hai jo ki unki upastithi ke abhi bhi pramaan hai jin main se ek he “ garuda kaa ped” yah ped abhi bhi shahatlai main maujuud he, isi ped ke neeche babaaji tapasya kiya karte the
 The second evidence is an old police station, located at "badsar" where cows were kept which had spoiled the crop of all the fields, the story of which is like this, a woman named 'ratno' , Had kept Babaji to guard his cows, in return for which Ratno used to give Babaji bread and lassi, it is believed that Babaji was so absorbed in his austerity that the cry given by Ratno Mr
 and buttermilk food was missing is not the same
 ek baar jab ratno babaaji kii aalochana kar rahi thi ki vah gaayon kaa thik se khyaal nahin rakhte jabaki ratno babaaji ke khaane pine kaa khub dhyaan rakhti hai
 Ratno had said this much that Babaji produced bread from the trunk of the tree and lassi from the ground
 babaaji ne sari umr brahmacharya kaa paalan kiya or isi baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue unki mahila bhakt ‘garbhagupha’ main pravesh nahin karti jo ki prakritik gupha main sthit he jahaan par babaaji tapasya karte hue antardhyaan ho gaye the

 antarrashtriya raajnneeti main nirbharta kaa siddhanth yah he ki sansaadhan, nirdhan evam alpaviksit deshon se dhani deshon kii ore pravaahit hote hai or nirdhan deshon ko or garib karte hue dhani deshon ko or dhani banaate hai
 The principle of dependence is based on the fundamental belief that there is a deep connection between political and economic factors
 ye donon kaarak paraspar prabhavit karte hai tathaa kaaphi had tak aarthik karkon ke aadhaar par raajnneeti main mahatvapurn badlaav dekhne ko milte hai
 The theory of dependence has been fundamentally influenced by Marxism
 marxvad ke saath-saath hobasan va lenin ke samrajyavad kii avadharana ne ise or majboot bana diya he
 But since Marxists do not believe in the existence of 'state', it would be more logical to consider it as 'neo-marxist' concept
 vaise to yah avadharana antarrashtriya raajnneeti main 1950 ke dashak se vidyaman he, parantu 1970 ke dashak se zyada mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For the study of international politics of this period, more emphasis has been given on the relationship between political and economic elements
 is siddhanth ke mukhya samarthakon main paul baraan, paul swiji, heri madagaf, andri gunder phank, agrahiri emenual, samir amin, emenual walrusten aadi pramukh hai
 This theory became very important after the 1970s
 nimnlikhit kaarnon se is siddhanth kii charchaa par adhik bal diya jane laga- This theory is very difficult to define, because different authors have tried to explain it in different ways
 mukhya rup se vibhinn vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki - This principle can be divided into two parts to facilitate analysis - bahut se vidwaanon ne is siddhanth ko ‘kendra’ va ‘paridhi’ ke rashtron ke madhya hui aarthik va rajnatik antalakriyaaon ke rup main dekha he
 Originally, there is not much difference in their thinking, but in view of more and less importance to a particular factor, they can be divided into three categories, which are described as follows - is varg ke agrani lekhak ke rup main raul prabisich kaa naam liya ja saktaa he jo sanyukt raashtra ke dakshini america aarthik ayog ke adhyaksh rahe
 Along with this, Furtado and Shankal can also be considered as belonging to this category
 is vichaar ke samarthak vidwaan antarrashtriya vyavastha ko kendra va paridhi ke rajyon main banta hua maanate hai
 According to him, due to traditional methods of production, much wealth has accumulated with the nations of the center
 isiilie un vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki vikaas va gaiyr vikaas yaa aviksit ko alag nahin kiya ja saktaa, balki ye donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 In addition, neither can today be distinguished between internal and external factors, but rather both are interconnected
 isiilie latin america deshon ke aadharbhoot audyogic vikaas ke baad hi unako aupniveshik va samrajyavaadee bandhanon se mukti mil sakati he
 But thinkers of this class have been criticized by both liberals and progressives
 udaarvaadiyon kaa kahana he ki ye vyapaar chakra ke aarthik vikaas prakriya par padane vaale prabhaav kaa adhyayan nahin karte
 While progressive scholars have alleged that the people associated with the structural school have been unable to properly and properly study exploitation
 iske atirikt, ye vidwaan is baat ko bhi najar andaaj kar dete hai ki paridhi vaale rashtron main vikaas kendra ke rashtron dwaara takneekon ke vishvikaran ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 Prominent among those associated with this opinion are Andrigundar Frank, Pal Baran, Samin Amin etc
 ye vidwaan vishwa vyavastha ko 'mahanagaron' va 'upgrahon' ke rup me vibhajit maanate hai
 Frank believes that there is always 'development of non-development' in states with 'satellites' through capitalism
 mahanagaron vaale raashtra apane atirikt puunji ke labhaansh se inhen or aviksit bana dete hai
 In states with satellites, 'development of underdevelopment' is only part of an entire historical process, in itself there is no independent activity
 isiilie jab-jab in upgrah vaale rashtron kaa mahanagaron vaale rashtron ke kamjor bandhan rahaa he inhone apni vikaas dar ko badhaayaa he tathaa jab jab ye unase adhik jude rahe hai yah prakriya vipareet rahi he
 That is why the development of backwardness in a nation can be studied in the capitalist system on the basis of posturing of that state
 iske atirikt, iskaa us samaaj main sthapit aarthik dhaanchon ke aadhaar par bhi moolyankan kiya ja saktaa he
 This view has also been criticized on two grounds - First, the availability of capital and capitalism are two different points, so they should not be considered one
 dwitiya, is siddhanth ke aadhaar par purna rup se yah sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa ki vikaas se kis prakaar latin america deshon main pichhadepan kaa vikaas hua he
 The third category is of thinkers who consider the relationship of dependence and development as connected
 inamen se pramukh vichaarak hai - caradoson, phaleto va osvaldo shankal
 They believe that historically-structurally South American countries have undergone fundamental changes in terms of capital investment
 unka maananaa he ki puunji nivesh krishi yaa kaccha maal ke utpaada kii bajaay taiyarshuda maal main lagaaya gaya he tathaa iske jude sanyukt udhyamon main sthaneey va bahya poojineveshkon main sahyog rahaa he
 That is why dependency, capitalism domination and development have been a situation of establishing a stored domination in third world countries rather than contradictory
 isiilie upabhokta vastuon ke utpaada ko badha kar teesri duniya ke deshon ke shahari aabaadi kii aavashyaktaa kii purti bahya bahurashtriya companiyon dwaara kii gai he
 That is why the structural system of these societies has been scattered
 isiilie in bahurashtriya companiyon ne teesri duniya ke deshon main nirbharta se jude vikaas kii sthiti paidaa kar di he
 Although the thinkers of this class have given a new interpretation apart from a predetermined interpretation, it could not properly use the theory of class as a basic unit
 uparokt teenon virgon main vichaaron main kahin-kahin bhinnata bhi dekhne ko milti he tathaa paramparaagat marxvad se bhi kai sandarbhon main alag he
 But it is true that according to all these, the nations with 'periphery' still depend on metropolitan centers in terms of economic development
 isi kaaran se shaayad mahanagaron me 'vikaas kaa vikaas' tathaa paridhi rashtron main 'avikas kaa vikaas' ho rahaa he
 Another form of dependency theory has also been studied under the world-system theory
 yadhyapi kuch vichaarak in donon ko alag maanate hai, parantu donon kii mul manyataon main koi antar nahin he
 The difference is only about interpretation
 atah ise nirbharta ke hi ek rup ke antargat swikaarna zyada uchit he
 Emmanuel Wallersten, the pioneer of the world system theory, can be said to have detailed it in his book The Modern World System
 walrusten kaa maananaa he ki itihaas main do prakaar kii vishwa pranaliyaan pai jaati hai - ‘vishwa samrajya’ va ‘vishwa arthvyavastha’
 The main difference between the two is how decisions are made about the sharing of resources
 unka maananaa he ki ‘vishwa samrajya’ vyavastha main shakti kaa prayog 'paridhi rajyon' se 'kendra rajyon' kii ore sansadhano kaa bantwaaraa kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, the world economy system lacks a centralized political structure
 atah kanoon ke dwaara sansaadhan kaa bantwaaraa kiye jane kii bajaae bazaar ke madhyam se ise sampann kiya jaataa he
 Thus, although both methods are different with respect to the sharing of resources, the overall result of both is the same
 vah he paridhi vaale rashtron se kendriya rajyon kii ore sansadhano kaa hastantaran ho rahaa he
 According to Wallerstein, 'central nations' are characterized by - democratic governments, high wages, import of raw materials, export of finished goods, high capital investment, welfare services, etc
 thik iske vipareet 'paridhi vaale rashtron' kii visheshtaayen hai - gaiyr-prajatantrik sarkaar paddati, kachche maal kaa niryaat, taiyaar maal kii aayaat, nimnastareey vetan, kalyankari sevaaon kaa abhaav
 But Wallerstein is slightly different from the dependencyists
 ve kendra va paridhi ke ilaava rashtron kii ek tritiy shrenee 'sam paridhi' bhi maanate hai
 Characteristics of these types of nations are - governing governments, export of raw and finished goods, import of finished goods and raw materials, low pay scale, low level welfare services etc
 walrusten kaa bhi maananaa he ki ye teenon shrenee ke raashtra aapas main utpaadan ke shoshnatmak tareekon se jude hue hai jiske madhyam se smapda kaa hastantaran paridhi ke kendra vaale rajyon kii taraf ho rahaa he
 It believes that due to gradual fluctuations, secular method and contradictions, there are crises in the world system
 inhen sankaton ke kaaran nai vishwa vyavastha kaa janm hota he
 Both Marxists and non-marxists have criticized Wallerstein's world system theory
 kuch lekhakon jaise chej va poon kaa maananaa he ki walrusten ne ise keval aarthik karkon tak hi simit kar diya, jabaki anya karkon kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 Second, Frank and Gill believe that Wallersten kept this whole episode centered on Europe, whose origins are believed to be from medieval Europe
 parantu yadi gahan adhyayan kiya jaae to vartmaan vishwa pranali kii jaden madhyayugin europe se kahin adhik majboot hai
 After studying in both the above stages, we can say that the main features of the principle of dependence are the following - nirbharta ke siddhanth kii nimnlikhit pramukh aadhaaron par aalochanaayen kii gai hai- Despite the above criticisms, the utility of this theory cannot be denied, which are as follows: atah nishkarsh rup main kaha ja saktaa he ki nirbharta ke siddhanth ke madhyam se kendra evam paridhi rashtron ke sambandhon ke madhyam se vishwa vyavastha ke parivartit swaroop ko adhyayan karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Through this principle, proper efforts have been made to understand the relationship of nations as a result of capitalism along with creating coordination in the current and historical contexts
 yadhyapi vibhinn vidwaanon ke vichaaron main bhinnata avashya he, parantu aarthik kaarak yaa poonjeevaad ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main mahatv pradaan karne par mukhya taur par aam sahmati najar aati he
 But from the larger form and practical study of this theory, many theoretical and practical shortcomings are clearly visible in this theory
 parantu aavashyaktaa is siddhanth ko tyaagane kii na hokar ise or baarikiyon ke saath taraashne kii kii he
 There is an urgent need to establish new generalizations through in-depth studies of problems arising between the center and the periphery nations and blocking growth

 In the late 1940s, Professor Eric Lathwaite of Imperial College, London, developed the first full-size practical model of a linear induction motor
 vah varsh 1964 main imperial college ke heavi electrical ejineering ke profesar bane, jahaan unhone apane raikhik motor ke safal vikaas ko chaalu rakhaa
 Since linear motors do not require physical contact between vehicles and guideways, it became a common stationary object of many advanced transport systems being developed in the 1960s and 1970s
 khud lathvet ne trecked hovercraft naamak ek isi tarah kii pariyojna ke vikaas main bhaag liya, haalanki is pariyojna ke vittaposhan ko 1973 main radd kar diya gaya
 Naturally the use of linear motors was also quite favorable for maglev systems

 In Japan, two independently developed maglev trains operate
 pehla train japan airlines dwaara chalaaya jane vaala echesasti or doosraa train japan railways group dwaara chalaaya jane vaala jeaar-meglev he jo zyada mashhoor he
 Development of the latter train began in the year 1969 and it continued at a speed of 517 kmph regularly on the Miyazaki test route until 1979, but after an accident in which the train was destroyed, a new design was made
 It was decided
 varsh 1997 main yamanashi main ek bahut bade or vistrut pareekshan maarg ko sthanantarit karne se pehle miyazaki main 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan kai pareekshan kiye jate rahe
 The development of HSST started in the year 1974 based on technologies introduced from Germany
 japan ke sucuba main, 30 kimi prati ghante kam raftaar se chalane baavjood echesasti-03 ko sucuba world expozishan main lokapriyata hasil hui

 High speed transportation monopolies were also granted to various other inventors around the world
 alfred zehden naamak avishkaarak ko ek raikhik motor prerit train ke liye sanyukt rajya america ke aarambhik ekasvadhikaron se sammanit kiya gaya
 The inventor was awarded US Patent 7,82,312 and US Patent RE, 127
 1907 main, ek or aarambhik vidyut chumbakeey transportesan system ko epa
 es

 Between the years 1937 and 1941 Hermann Kemper was awarded several German monopolies for magnetic levitation trains inspired by linear motors
 ek aarambhik aadhunik prakaar ke meglev train kaa varnan ji
 aar
 polgreen kii america patent 31,58,765, magnetic system of transportesan main kiya gaya tha
 "maglev" was first used by Canadian Patents and Development Ltd
 in "magnetic Levitation Guidance", a patent in the United States
 "meglev" shabd keval vishesh rup se chumbakeey uttolan evam pranodan ke liye banaae gaye vaahanon ko hi nahin, balki railway system ko bhi sanderbhit karata he
 All operational implementations of maglev technology have minimal overlap with wheeled train technology and are not compatible with conventional rail tracks
 chunki ve maujuuda aadharbhoot sanrachanaon kaa saajha nahin kar sakate hai, isliye in meglev pranaaliyon ko paripurna parivahan pranaaliyon ke rup main hi banaaya janaa chahie
 The applied Levitation SPM maglev system is interoperable with steel rail tracks and it allowed maglev vehicles and conventional trains to run on the same track at the same time
 germany main emeen ne ek meglev system kaa bhi nirmaan kiya jo paaramparik patariyon ke saath kaam karata tha lekin ise kabhi puri tarah se viksit nahin kiya gaya
 There are two particularly notable types of maglev technology: ek or prayogtmak praudyogiki - chumbakeey gatibodhak nilamban he, jiskaa dizine banaaya gaya, jise ganitiya aadhaar par siddh kiya gaya, sahakarmiyon dwaara isaki samiksha kii gai or ekasvadhikaar pradaan kiya gaya, lekin abhi bhi iskaa nirmaan nahin hua he, jo train ko uthaane or ise iske niyat sthaan par sthapit karne ke liye ek steel trek ke paas ek sthaayee chumbak sarini ke aakarshak chumbakeey bal kaa istemaal karti he
 Numerous research has been conducted in other technologies such as repulsive permanent magnets and superconducting magnets
 maujuuda vidyut chumbakeey nilamban pranaaliyon main, train ispaat kii ek patari par uthta he jabaki train se sanlagn vidyut chumbak neeche se patari kii taraf jhuke hue hai
 This system is usually arranged on a series of C-shaped arms and the upper part of the arm is attached to the vehicle and the lower part is attached to the magnet in the inner edge
 patari upree or nichle kinaaron ke bich sthit hoti he
 The magnetic attraction varies with the cube of the distance, so slight changes in the distance between the magnets and the track also produce a much variable force
 bal main kiye gaye ye parivartan gatyaatmak rup se asthir hote hai - yadi anukultam sthiti main halkaa sa bhi vichlan hota he, to isamen vruddhi ho sakati he or trek se ek aparivartansheel duuri ) par ek train ko banaae rakhane ke liye pratipushti niyantran kii jatil pranaaliyon kii jarurat padati he
 a major advantage of suspended maglev systems is that they operate at all speeds, while electromagnetic systems operate at a speed of at least about 30 kmph
 yah ek alag kam gati vaali nilamban pranali kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt kar detii he or parinamswaroop yah trek leout ko saral bana saktaa he
 The downside of this is that the dynamic instability of the system requires over-tolerance of the track, which can reverse, or eliminate this advantage
 is avadharana kii atyadhik uljhan ke falswaroop lathvet ko is baat kii chintaa thi ki apekshit sahishnutaa vaale ek trek kaa nirmaan karne ke liye chumbakon or patari ke bich ke antaraal ko us sthaan tak badha dena hoga jahaan chumbak anuchit dhang se bade honge
 In practice, this problem was addressed through enhanced performance of feedback systems, which allow the system to run with deeper tolerance
 vidyut gatibodhak nilamban main, patari or train donon ek chumbakeey kshetra par bal lagaate hai or in chumbakeey kshetron ke darmyaan pratikaarak bal kii vajah se train uttolit ho jaataa he
 The magnetic field in the train is generated by either an array of electromagnets or permanent magnets
 taron main ek prerit chumbakeey kshetra yaa trek main anya chaalak pattiyon dwaara trek main pratikaarak bal paidaa hota he
 a major advantage of repulsive maglev systems is that they are inherently stable - a slight contraction in the distance between the track and the magnets generates too much force that forces the magnets back to their original position, while in the distance a slight increase reduces the force and once again the vehicle returns to perfect isolation
 koi pratipushti niyantran jaruri nahin he
 Repulsive systems also have a major downside
 dhimi gati par, in coilon or parinami chumbakeey pravaah main prerit dhara itani bhi adhik nahin hoti he ki vah train ke vajan ko sahaara de sake
 For this reason it is very important to have wheels or some other type of landing gear in the train to support the train till it reaches the speed with the ability to maintain leverage
 chunki train, udhaaharan ke taur par upkaran kii kharabi kii vajah se, kisi bhi sthaan par ruuk saktaa he, isliye sampoorn trek main train kii nimna-gati or ucch-gati donon tarah ke sanchaalan ko sahaara dene kii kshamta honi chahie
 Another downside to this is that the repulsive systems naturally create an area in the track in front and back of the lifting magnets that works against the magnets and produces a kind of stretch position
 yah aam taur par nimna gati vaali pranaaliyon ke liye ek chintaa kaa vishay he, ucchtar gati vaali pranaaliyon main is prabhaav ke liye utana samay nahin nikal paata he jisase yah isaki sampoorn kshamta or anya prakaar ke khinchaav par haaavee ho sake
 The traction force can be used to the advantage of an electromagnetic system, however, because it generates a variable force in the tracks that can be used as a reactionary system to drive the train, with a separate Reaction plates are not needed, as in most linear motor systems
 lathvet ne imperial college kii apni prayogshaala main "pargaman-pravaah" jaisi pranaaliyon ke vikaas kaa netritv kiya
 Alternatively, propulsion coils from the guideway are used to apply force to the magnet of the train and to propel the train forward
 train par bal lagane vaale pranodan coil prabhavi taur par ek raikhik motor hote hai: coilon ke madhyam se pravaahit hone vaali ek parivartansheel dhara ek nirantar parivartaneey chumbakeey kshetra kaa nirmaan karti he jo trek ke saath aage kii taraf badhata rahata he
 The frequency of the variable current is synchronized to match the speed of the train
 train main lagi chumbakon ke bal se nirmit kshetra or lagu kshetra ke bich kaa antarlamb ek aisa bal utpann karata he jo train ko aage kii taraf le jaataa he
 Each implementation of the magnetic levitation principle for train-like travel involves advantages and disadvantages
 pranali kii nihit asthirataa or bahari pranaaliyon dwaara aavashyak nirantar sudhaar kii vajah se kampan ke mudde uth sakate hai
 Neither the Inductrack nor the superconducting EDS have the ability to levitate a stationary vehicle, although the Inductrack provides levitation for a very low speed; These systems require wheels
 iemes pranaliyaan pahiyaa-viheen hoti hai
 The German transrapid, the Japanese HSST and the Korean Rotem EMS maglev levitate, for which the required power is obtained from the guideway using electric tracks for the latter two maglevs and without using any wires for the transrapid
 yadi gatisheel avasthaa main guideway kii bijli chali jaati he, onboard badariyon kii bijli kaa istemaal karke transrapid us vaqt bhi 10 kimi / ghanta kii raftaar se uttolan utpann karne main sakasham hota he
 But this does not happen with HSST and Rotem systems
 ek idies pranali ek onboard raikhik motor kaa upyog kar uttolan or pranodan donon kii suvidha pradaan kar sakati he
 EMS systems can levitate the train using onboard magnets, but cannot propel it forward
 kyonki vaahanon ko pranodan ke liye kuch anya praudyogikiyon kii jarurat padati he
 a linear motor installed in the track is one solution to this problem
 pranodan coilon kii nishedhaatmak laagat vaali lambi duriyon ke maamle main ek propeller yaa jet ingine kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Arnshaw's theorem shows that no combination of stationary magnets can be in a stable equilibrium
 haalanki, vibhinn uttolan pranaliyaan arnashow ke prameya kii manyataon kaa ulanghan karke sthir uttolan karti hai
 Earnshaw's theorem assumes that the field strength of magnets is static and invariant and that the relative permeability is constant and its value is greater than 1 everywhere
 iemes pranaliyaan sakriy electronic sthirikaran par bharosa karti hai
 Such systems continuously measure the carrying distance and adjust the current of the electromagnet accordingly
 sabhi idies pranaliyaan gatisheel pranaliyaan hai 
 Since maglev vehicles basically fly, magnetic technology is required to stabilize pitch, roll and deviation
 iske atirikt kuch praudyogikiyon ke saath roopantaran, vruddhi, ghumaav yaa utaar-chadhaav kii samasya utpann ho sakati he
 Some systems use tap flux systems, also known as tap current systems, these systems use a coil that is rotated so that it enters two opposing, variable areas
 jab vaahan ekadam se ek sidh main hota he, koi dhara pravaahit nahin hoti he, lekin yadi yah line se dur gati karata he to ek parivartansheel pravaah utpann hota he jo jisase ek aise kshetra kaa nirmaan hota he jo ise line main waapas dhakel detaa he
 Some systems propose the use of vacatrain — a blank tube used in a vehicle with maglev technology — to minimize air traction
 isamen gati evam dakshata ko badhaane kii bahut adhik kshamta he, jabaki paaramparik meglev trainon kii adhikansh urja vaayu karshan main nasht ho jaati he
 a potential risk for passengers of trains operating in empty tubes is that passengers face the risk of cabin pressure retraction until tunnel safety monitoring systems re-pressurize the tube in the event of a train malfunction or accident Can
 rand korporation ne ek vaikum tub train kaa dizine taiyaar kiya he jo siddhanthata atlantic yaa america ko 20 minute main paar kar saktaa he
 Energy for maglev trains is used to accelerate the train and can be regained when the train slows down
 iskaa istemaal train ko uttolit karne or train ke sanchalan ko sthir karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 The main part of this energy is necessary to force the train through air
 iske alaava kuch urja kaa istemaal air condishning, heating, prakaash vyavastha or anya vividh pranaaliyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The percentage of electricity used for levitation at very low speeds can be quite significant
 iske alaava bahut kam duriyon ke liye twaran ke liye istemaal hone vaali urja par vichaar kiya ja saktaa tha
 But the power used to overcome air traction increases with the cube of velocity and therefore dominates at high speeds and the track design work for EMS maglev systems is limited to any other than point-by-point services
 Is also challenging for something
 ghumaav saumy hona chahie, jabaki switch bahut lambe hote hai or bijli ke pravaah ke samay ise tuutane se bachaane ke liye isaki dekhbhaal karne kii jarurat he
 An SPM maglev system, in which the vehicle is permanently levitated on tracks, can quickly switch tracks using electronic controls where the track has no moving parts
 ek prototip espm meglev train ne swayan train kii lambaai ke baraabar trigya vaale ghumaav kaa bhi morganirdesan kiya he, jo yah darshata he ki ek purna paimaane vaale train ko ek paramparaagat train ke samaan yaa usase parimit trigya vaale ghumaav kaa morganirdesan karne kii kshamta honi chahie
 For many systems, it is possible to define a leverage-to-traction ratio
 meglev pranaaliyon ke liye ye anupaat vimaan se adhik ho sakate hai 
 isse meglev kii prati kilometre kshamta adhik ho sakati he
 However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic traction is much higher than levitation-induced traction
 jet parivahan vimaan kaaphi oonchai par paribhraman ke dauraan karshan ko kam karne ke liye nimna vaayu ghanatv kaa phayda uthaata he, isliye apane uttolan-se-karshan anupaat ke nuksaan ke baavjood, ve ucch gati par meglev trainon kii tulana main adhik kushaltapurvak yatra kar sakate hai jo samudr sataha par sanchalit hote hai 
 vimaan adhik lacheele bhi hote hai or upyukt airport suvidhaon ke praavdhaan ke saath adhik gantavyon kii seva pradaan kar sakate hai
 Unlike airplanes, maglev trains are powered by electricity and thus do not need to carry fuel
 udaan bharne or neeche utarane ke dauraan hone vaali durghatnaon ke samay vimaan eendhan ek bahut bada khatra ban jaataa he
 In addition, electric trains emit less carbon dioxide, especially when powered by atomic or renewable sources

 Pahlav an ancient caste
 praayah pracheen parsi yaa irani
 In ancient books like Manusmriti, Ramayana, Mahabharata etc
, wherever there are mention of castes settling in the west of India, Khas, Yavan, Shaka, Kamboj, Wahlik, Pard etc
, the name of the Pahlavas has also come there
 uparyukt tathaa anya sanskrit granthon main pahlav shabd saamaanya reeti se paras nivaasiyon yaa iraniyon ke liye vyavahrut hua he musalmaan aitihaasikon ne bhi isko pracheen parsikon kaa naam mana he
 In ancient times, the calling of the 'pahru-lavan' of the Persian chieftains is also a supporter that Pahlav is the name of the Parsis
 shashneey samraaton ke samay main paras kii pradhan bhashaa or lipi kaa naam pahlvi pad chukaa tha
 However, some European historians 'pahlavas' are mistaken for all the Paras residents, not just Parthia residents, as abusive nouns
 paras ke kuch pahari sthano main praapt shilalekhon main 'parthav' naam kii ek jati kaa ullekh he
 Dr
 Haag Adi says that this 'parthva' can be the name of Parthians and 'pahlav' is the same Phalki Apabhramsa of this Parthv as the mihir of Avesta's Mithra
 apane mat kii pushti main ye log do pramaan or bhi dete hai
 One is that it is written in the Armani language that the kingship of Arsak kings was 'pahlav'
 doosraa yah ki parthiyavaasiyon ko apni shur veerta or yupriyata kaa bada ghamand tha or farsi ke 'pahalwaan' or armani ke 'pahalveey' shabdon kaa arth bhi shoorveer or yupriy he
 It is a matter of why the Paraswalas accepted this noun for themselves and why the people around them mentioned it with the same name
 iskaa uttar uparyukt aitihaasik yah dete hai ki parthianwaalon ne paanch sau varsh tak paras main rajya kiya or romanon aadi se yuddh karke unhen haraaya
 In such a situation it is not surprising that the word 'pahlav' is so closely associated with Paras
 sanskrit pustakon main sabhi sthalon par 'paarad' ouk 'pahlav' ko alag alag do jatiyaan maanakar unka ullekh kiya gaya he
 In Harivansh Purana, there is a description of the different costumes of both of them fixed by Maharaja Sagara
 pahlav unki ajna se 'shmashrudhari' hue or paarad 'muktkesh' rahane lage
 According to Manusmriti, 'pahlavas' were also primitive Kshatriyas like Pardas, Shakas, etc
 and due to the invisibility of Brahmins, they became shudras like them
 harivansh puraana ke anusaar maharaj sagar na inhen balaat kshatriyadharm se patit kar mlechh banaaya
 Its story is that the Haihayavanshi Kshatriyas had seized the kingdom of Sagar's father Bahu
 paarad, pahlav, yavan, kamboj aadi kshatriyon ne haihyavanshiyon kii is kaam main sahaayta kii thi
 Sagar was able to defeat the Haihayavans and regain his father's kingdom
 unke sahaayak hone ke kaaran 'pahlav' aadi bhi unke kopbhaajan hue
 These people fled in fear of King Sagara and took shelter of their guru Vasishta
 vashishtha ne inhen abhaydaan diya
 To save the Guru, Sagar gave up his life but took religion, by excluding him from the student religion, he got maltreatment
 valmikiy ramayana ke anusaar 'pahlvon' kii utpatti vashishtha kii gau shabla ke humbharav se hui he
 When he was defeated by Vishwamitra, he was among the first of the many Kshatriya castes to fight the orders of Vasishta with his word 'pahlav'
 hindu dharm main vishnu puraana ke anusaar prithvi kaa varnan is prakaar he
 This description was made by Sriparasharji to Shri Maitreya Rishi
