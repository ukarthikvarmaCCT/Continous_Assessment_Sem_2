 Remak has defined comparative literature as: tulanaatmak sahitya angreji ke ‘comparative litarechar’ kaa hindi anuwaad he
 It is developed as an independent discipline and special importance is being given to its study and teaching work in various universities abroad
 angreji ke kavi ‘mathew ornald’ ne san 1848 main apane ek patr main sabase pehle ‘comparative litarechar’ pad kaa prayog kiya tha
 In India in 1907, Rabindra Nath Thakur, while referring to world literature, emphasized the need for comparative vision in the study of literature
 maanav ke saanskrithik itihaas kii sahaj dhara ke aashray main hi ‘ravi babu’ ne tulanaatmak sahitya ke adhyayan par bal diya tha
 The recognition of an independent study in the subject of comparative literature is a controversial topic even today
 tulanaatmak sahitya kaa bhi ek drushtikon he, ek pravidhi he or ek takneekee he
 The trends in comparative literature are still not completely stable

 kisi namoonay yaa pranali ke padaarth kii maatra, n, ek bhautik maatra he, jo ki usamen sthit moulik astitv kanon kii sankhya ke anupaat main he
 "elemental existence particles" can also be molecules, atoms, ions, electrons or any other particle, the choice of which is context based and must be fixed
 Matra of matter is sometimes called chemical quantity or incorrectly called number of moles
 padaarth kii maatra ke liye SI ikai he mol
 Its definition is: kitna padaarth he, yah bataane hetu bhaar yaa aaytan ke bajaay padaarth kii maatra, kyon prayog karen? yah isaliye he, kyonki rasinic kyiaon main anu se anu, parmaanu se parmaanu, aayan se aayan kriya karte hai
 Because different molecules and atoms have different weights, not all of these substances of 100 grams contain the same amount of matter
 udaahranarth, 100 gram oxygen main 100 gram carbon se kam anu hote hai
 See: stoichiometry kisi padaarth kii maatra bataate samay, sandarbhit astitv kan bataanaa aavashyak he 
 ek mol chlorine kaa arth chlorine parmaanu bhi ho saktaa he or chlorin anu bhi ho saktaa he
 The simplest method to remove the doubt is to give the names of existent particles in place of the word "substance", or to tell the empirical formula
 For example: yah "maatra" shabd kii takneeki paribhaasha kahi ja sakati he
 Its application has been seen in many derived quantities
 When amount of substance enters into a derived quantity, it is usually as the denominator: such quantities are known as "molar quantities"
 For example, the quantity which describes the volume occupied by a given amount of substance is called the molar volume, while the quantity which describes the mass of a given amount of substance is the molar mass
 Molar quantities are sometimes denoted by a subscript Latin "m" in the symbol, e
g
 Cp,m, molar heat capacity at constant pressure: the subscript may be omitted if there is no risk of ambiguity, as is often the case in pure chemistry
 The main derived quantity in which amount of substance enters into the numerator is amount of substance concentration, c
 This name is often abbreviated to "amount concentration", except in clinical chemistry where "substance concentration" is the preferred term
 The name "molar concentration" is incorrect, if commonly used

 His first military campaign was against the Saka satraps of Saurashtra
 sangharsh prakriya evam anya sambhddha vishyon kaa vistrut gyaan uplabdh nahin hota

 Longinus is traditionally believed to be the creator of a work called "sublime element in poetry"
 is kriti main achche lekhan ke prabhaavon kii charchaa he
 The real name of Longinus is not known
 vah unani kavyalochan kaa shikshak tha
 Its period is estimated to be from the first to the third century
 lonzinus ne kavy ko shreshth banane vaale tatwon par vichaar karte hue is siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 He considers the sublime as the element that makes poetry better and the poet the prestige
 yah udaatt mahaan vichaaron sangathit alankaar yojana, abhijatya pad rachana tathaa prabhaav kii garima main nihit he
 They consider Vagadambara Baleta and Bhavadambara as obstructing elements
 jis prakaar bhartiya kavyashastra main kavy ke swaroop or uski aatma ko lekar vibhinn maton kaa pratipaadan hua he usee prakaar paashchaatya aalochana ke kshetra main vibhinn yugon main vibhinn chintakon ne kavy yaa sahitya ke mul tatva kii khoj kii he
 Plato considered simulation to be the core of literature
 inkaa pallavan arestu ne apni drushti se kiya or virechan ko sahitya kaa uddeshy sweekaar kiya
 Similarly, Longinus has a sublime theory
 is siddhanth ke dwaara unhone yah spasht kiya he ki koi bhi kalakriti yaa kavyakruti bina udaatt tatva ke shreshth rachana nahin ho sakati
 The best is the one who has deep thoughts and feelings of the Creator
 rachanaakaar kaa yah anubhuti tatva apni mahanata, udaattata, bhavyata yaa garima ke kaaran rachana ko mahaan banaata he
 Creation or creation gets expression through craft; But the author of the sublime work tries not to worry too much about the beauty of the craft in his creation, to strengthen the feeling contained in it
 is udaatt siddhanth ko prastut karanevaale acharya lonzinus he
 His Greek language name is Longinus and in English language is pronounced 'longinus'
 inaki rachana kaa naam ‘perihutsus’ he, jiskaa angreji main ‘on da sablim’ naam se anuwaad kiya gaya
 This is what is called the sublime in Hindi
 iskaa granth paashchaatya sahitya-shaastra kaa pramukh granth he
 Lonaginus's definition of the sublime and its general introduction as it appears that the term had become so prevalent in his time that he felt no need to give it a detailed introduction
 phir bhi udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karte hue unhone itnaa kaha- That is, the name of the distinctiveness and superiority of the expression is sublime
 isi ko lakshya karke hindi aalochakon ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki kisi rachana main udaatt tatva upyukt tathaa garimapurna shabd-vidhaan, aaveg ko deept karne vaali alankaar yojana tathaa rachana-vidhaan dwaara abhivyakt hota he
 Longinus described the sublime of poetry as distinct from speech, because in poetry the effect of sublime on the audience is in the form of subjectivity, not as enforcement
 is kaaran lonzinus kii drushti main bhavy kavita vahiin he jo anandatirek ke kaaran hamen itnaa nimagn or tanmay kar de ki ham aisi ucch bhav-bhoomi par pahunch jaae jahaan varnya vishay vidyut-prakaash kii bhanti aalokit ho uthta he
 From this point of view, Longinus can be seen to have a lot of equanimity in the thawed-vedhyantar of Anandatirek and Vishwanath
 udaatt ke swaroop ke antargat lonzinus main manovaigyanik or vyavhaarik donon drushtiyon ko saamne rakhaa
 This is why he has mentioned the internal elements of the sublime on one side and has also discussed its external side
 udaatt mul aadhaar kya he? kya vah vaktaa yaa lekhak kii janmajaat pratibha par aadhaarit hota he yaa uskaa prasphuton shiksha-diksha se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he yaa abhyaas par nirbhar he? in prashnon par vichaar karte hue lonzinus ne madhya maarg kaa anukaran kiya he
 Sublime to his view is neither genius relative to all nor relative to practice
 vastutah udaatt kaa aadhaar vyakti kaa koi ek paksh, ek gun yaa ek pravriti nahin he apitu uske peeche sampoorn vyaktitv kii jhalak hoti he
 Therefore, the creation of a sublime can be a sublime personality
 mahaan pratibhashali ucch vidwaan evam yashasvi charitravaan vyakti hi udaatt yaa udghoshak ho saktaa he
 According to Longinus - "sublime is a reflection of the greatness of the soul
" sachcha udaatt keval unheen main prapya he jinaki chetana udaatt evam vicasonmukh he
 It is quite natural that the words of those whose minds are full of lofty perceptions can be echoed by lofty words
 ’’ In this way, the sublime is concerned not only with the study of talent, study and language, but with the entire personality of the person
 nishkarshtah Its effect is not gradual, incidental and the narrative shines through its unique light
 yadhyapi udaatt ke muladhar sahityakar ke vyaktitv kii mahanata main nihit he phir bhi rachana main udaatt kaa tatva laane main liye lonzinus ne paanch sroton kii charchaa kii he- Out of the above five elements, the first two are part of the birthright ie poet-talent and the remaining three are art related features
 udaatt ke stroton main pratham sthaan vichaar kii mahatta kaa he
 This is what Loninus also called the grandeur of the soul by word
 unka spasht kathan he- ‘‘udaatt mahaan kii aatma kii pratidhwani hota he
 "if this importance of the soul is not natural then it can be achieved by excellent ideas
 mahaan shabd unheen ke mukh se nikalate hai jinamein vichaar gambheer or gahan hon
 Only rich writers with great ideas can create sublime
 lonzinus kii yah aisi avadharana he, jisase unki udaatt-prabhaav sambandhi dharna bhi judi hui hai
 The effect of the sublime is atrophy, not persuasion
 yah dharna is baat ko visheshikrut karti hai ki atmaati kraman bhavy or mahaan vichaaron kii garimamayi abhivyakti se hi sambhav he
 In fact, spiritual greatness is the first condition of sublime creation, that is why the effect of sublime will also be considered morally welfare
 is prakaar udaatt sahitya kaa prabhaav naitik tathaa kalatmak donon hi drushtiyon se uttam mana janaa chahie
 From this point of view, Longinus and Grandmother Milton descend on the same level
 milton ke anusaar mahaan sahityakar banane ke liye mahaan or ati sammanneey vastuon kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 Milton's view is- manasviyon ko yah bhavy vaani sahaj hi praapt ho jaati hai
 Sometimes it happens that the talented poet cools down like the sun setting in the evening of his life and the lack of sublime appears in his later poetry
 odisi main homer kii isi astachal-gamini pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 Longinus states - "elliot is Homer's creation of youthfulness, because it has the essence of motion and struggle
 iske vipareet, odissi kaa bahulansh aakhyanatmak hai, jo budhaape kii dein he
 "vishnu Priya" and "ratnavali" of Maithilisharan Gupta in Hindi are similar poems, in which the brilliance of their talent can be seen
 pant or bachchan kaa parvarti kavy bhi iskaa udhaaharan hai
 Longinus emphasizes the imperative of boisterous impulses in the artwork, as it is necessary for the work to be great to provide emotional stimulation to the readers
 bhavavesh yaa bhavy aaveg ve hen jinase ‘aatma’ apane aap upar uthne lagati hai or phir harshollas se bhar jaati hai
 Longinus has created two classes of impulses — one grand and the other inferior
 bhavy aavegon main ucch bhavavesh arthath utkrisht bhaavana prabalya, aadar, vismay, ullas or shaury aadi kii gananaa karte hai, jabaki nimna aavegon kaa sambandh karunaa, shok or bhay se he
 To fill the sublime in poetry, the eclipse of high emotion and low emotion should be discarded
 lonzinus kaa mat he ki alankaaron kaa prayog is kushalta se hona chahie ki is baat par kisi kaa dhyaan na jaae ki vah alankaar he
 When art is used skillfully, it loses its beauty and its configuration of miracles
 vastutah alankaar kii chamatkrit na karen, apitu vah anand hetuk hona chahie
 Longinus considered superlative ornaments to be sublime
 unke anusaar vistaarna, shapathokti, prashnalankar, viparyay, vyatikram, punrariti, pratyakshikaran, sanchay, saar, rup-parivartan, paryyokti, atishyokti aadi alankaaron main udaatt vidyaman rahata hai
 Therefore, it is necessary for the sublime to be spontaneous and justified
 udaahranarth Longineus by poetic expression means poetic language
 unhone bhashaa kii utkrushtataa par vishesh bal diya he; kyonki udaatt kii abhivyakti bhashaa ke madhyam se hoti he
 It is imperative to have a proper, appropriate effect and syllogism of the phrase, because by using energetic language, the creator can create a work that has a bad effect
 upyukt or prabhavi shabdaawalee ke dwaara rachana main bhavyata, garima, oj, madev, shakti aadi gunon kaa samavesh or jeevantata kaa sanchaar hota he
 Rachna-vidhan means symmetric word-plan or word plan in a certain order
 lonzinus ke anusaar vibhinn tattvon kaa parsparik saamanjasy kriti ko garimapurna banaata he
 Just as there is no importance for the different elements of the body to remain independent, the creation of the entire body is possible only when it is found, in the same way, the creation of a dignified work is done by the combination of all the elements
 rachana ke sabhi tatva milakar jab saamanjasy kii shrinkhalaa main bandh jate hai, tabhi un main udaatt aata he
 Otherwise it falls apart
 kabhi-kabhi rachana-tattvon kaa saamanjasy us kshati kii aapurti kar detaa he, jo rachana ke kisi vishesh tatva-dosha se utpann hoti he or is prakaar yah saamanjasy udaatt-prabhaav ko akshunn banaaye rakhata he
 Therefore, the dignified and magnificent composition-law is also the nutrient of sublime-creation
 lonzinus ne udaatt ke virdohi tattvon par bhi vichaar kiya he
 He has considered balata, unrestrained vagvistar, chaotic pedagogy, inferior words, mood and rhetoric, unwanted brevity, unnecessary decor, excessive emphasis on music and rhythm, etc
 as the antithesis of sublime
 atah shreshth kavi ko apni rachana main inhen sthaan nahin dena chahie
 This is a major flaw of the genre
 ‘baley’ kaa shabdic arth he ‘bachakaana’
 Just as agility, numbness, lightness and shortness are found in children, baldness will be considered in that style
 jisamen bina sanyam ke vagsfiti kii jaae, kshudra arth dyotak shabdon kaa prayog ho or chanchal yaa asthir pad-vinyas paaya jaae
 The style becomes artificial in this
 lonzinus ke anusaar- Use of ornate and heavy words in the absence of dignity of feeling
 jaise griddha jaise chote padaarth ke liye ‘jivit samadhi’ shabd kaa prayog
 Vagadambar arises from the attempt of sublime encroachment
 jahaan lekhak madyap kii bhanti aacharan kar praayah anpekshit, nirarthak or asangat aaveg kii abhivyakti karata he arthath jahaan aaveg ke niyantran kii aavashyaktaa hone par bhi aaveg kii abhivyakti kii jaae
 The expression of impulse gives rise to mood and reduces subluxation
 logon ko prabhavit karne ke moh main atishyoktipurna kathan hi shabdaadambar he
 Bihari couplets in Hindi suffer from this defect
 udaahranarth, lonzinus kaa mat he ki stri ke liye chakshu-dansh athwa ‘chakshu-phoduk’ or ‘putali’ ke liye ‘aankh kii kumari’ aadi shabdon kaa prayog maatr shabdaadambar he, bhashaa kaa alankaar nahin he
 In later critics, Hegel compares it to beauty to illustrate the nature of the sublime
 uske matanusaar soundarya kaa arth he saamanjasy
 In beauty, there is a harmony between the object and art aspects
 udaatt kii sthiti sundar se bhinn he
 Sublime is one where his emotion is more expansive and quintessential than his form
 higel yah bhi maanate hai ki udaatt ke mul main vichaaron kii utkrushtataa he or vichaaron kii mahatta vyakti ke ucch charitra se janm paati he
 If the character of a person is great then his thoughts will also be great
 edmund bark ne lonzinus dwaara vivechit pratibha-prasut kalpana tathaa vichaar bhaavana aadi kii vishalata ke aadhaar par udaatt ke swaroop kii spashtikaran karte hue kaha he ki jis vastu yaa rachana main prabhavit karne kii shakti he or jo apane abhinav prabhaav se prekshak ko chakit kar sakati he, vahiin udattatavya samajhnaa chahie
 We can take the example of creation of the sublime element, the great form of Hanuman presented in the pyramid and the beautiful form of ramacharitra-manas, the great form of Krishna in the Mahabharata, etc
 bark ne udaatt-tatva padaarthon ke atirikt dhwani ke bheetar bhi sweekaar kiya he, jaise baari aandhi, vishaal prapaat, bijli kii garaj, topon kii garjana main bhi udaatt-tatva rahata he
 In fact, arrogance is closer than lofty than beauty
 kavi-karm ke rup main anand kii pratishtha lonzinus kii aisi dein he jo ek ore unhen horess jaise alankaar-shastri se or duusari ore arestu jaise kavy-shastri se bhinn karti he
 Aristotle's depiction is a kind of treatment envisaged especially in the context of tragedy, while Longine's 'anand' is a feat whose nutritious foundation extends to all of epic tragedy, progress
 vastutah udaatt kaa vivechan or vishleshan lonzinus ke ‘peri ipsus’ me sarvaadhik rup main hua he
 The lofty theory of Longinus is the result of western review
 unka ‘udaatt’ jivan ke arjeet paksh kii abhivyakti hai, madhur paksh ke liye usamen koi sthaan nahin he
 Therefore, his scripture is incomplete due to discussing half of life
 bhartiya kavyashastra kii purnataa usamen kahan, jisamen oj ke saath maadhurya gun bhi he
 On one side there is heroic and wonderful rasa and on the other hand there is adornment and humor
 vah sampoorn maanav kii kriti he
 The reason for this loneliness in Longinus's belief is that he composed his book as a form of speech, not poetry
 isiilie safal bhaashan ke liye mahatvapurn tattvon kaa hi nirvachan isamen miltaa he

 Under linguistics, semantics or 'semantics' is a method related to the meaning of words
 bhashaa ke daayre main shabdon or vaakyon ke taatpary kaa adhyayan arth-vigyaan kehalaata he
 Economics was not recognized as a separate discipline before the late nineteenth century
 francisi bhashaa-shastri mishael bril ne is anushaasan kii sthapana kii or ise 'cementics' kaa naam diya
 After the linguistic revolution in the early twentieth century promoted by Ferdinand the Sasseur, the feet of cementics began to accumulate in sociology
 cementics kaa pehla kaam he bhashaai shreniyon kii pahchaan karnaa or unhen upyukt shabdaawalee main vyakhyayit karnaa
 Earth-to-top but intricate from within cannot be without the help of cementics
 udhaaharan ke liye ‘nashwar hote hai log’ or ‘nashwar the gandhi’ ke bich arth-grahan ke antar par drushti daal kar cementics kii upyogita kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The implication of the second sentence is that Gandhi was considered immortal or that people like Gandhi are also mortal
 cementics yah pataa lagaataa he ki arth-grahan kaa yah antar paidaa karne main bhashaa kaise kaam karti he
 The strange thing is that initially philologists rather than deep on economics
 saath ke dashak se bhashavidon ne bhashaai arthon ke do buniyadi prakaaron ko rekhaankit karnaa shuru kiya
 It is believed that the first type of meaning is congenial in linguistic form
 duusari kism kaa taalluk us rup ke bole jane or us abhivyakti ke sandarbh ke bich anyonyakriya se hota he
 k has been interpreted under differentiation of three
 inamen pehla he bodh or sandarbh ke bich kaa antar
 The second is the difference between the meaning of the word and the meaning of the sentence
 teesraa he paath or sandarbh ke bich kaa antar
 This third difference is now separated from cementics by linguists as a new discipline in the form of pragmatics
 cementics ke tahat jis bhashaa kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he use lakshya-bhashaa kii sangya di jaati he or jis bhashaa main uski vyakhya kii jaati he use metaalenguage kehete hai
 a target language may play the metalinguistic role of its interpretation
 bhashaa-shaastra ke itihaas main arth-grahan sambandhi kavayaden pehle shabd-kendrit thim, phir ve vaakya-kendrit huin or phir ve paath- kendrit ho gayin
 These three processes have influenced the disciplines of media-study, literature, interpretive sociology and cognitive science
 cementics prashn uthaata he ki kisi shabd ke arth kii shinaakht bhashaa ke daayre ke bheetar hi kii jaae yaa arth-nirupan ke liye uske bahari daayre se bhi madad lee jaae
 For example, we know the meaning of chair, but how do we get this meaning? We can say that he sits on a chair
 par, bhashaa ke bheetar kursi kaa arth furniture, mez, seat yaa bench jaise anya arthon sahit uske sambandh ke saath bhi grahan kiya jaataa he
 The meaning of the chair used to sit with these words is different
 bodh or sandarbh ke bich antar kaa ek or udhaaharan shukr grah yaa venus he
 It is also called the morning star and evening star, because its brightness is visible in the morning and also in the night
 is tarah shukr, bhor kaa tara or sandhya-tara ek hi chiz ke teen naam hai
 But despite the context being the same, all three are used for different realizations
 cementics kaa jor sandarbh par kam or bodh par adhik rahata chunki arth-grahan ke hi chahta he, isliye vah nateeja nikalataa he ki yatharth kii samaj bhi bhashaa ke zariye hi hasil ho sakati he or uske liye samskruti, itihaas or anya bhautik prakriyaaon kaa koi mahatva nahin he
 Cementics uses three main relations synonyms, antonyms, and hyponomicals to achieve semantics within the language
 hyponanimakal shrenee ve aate jinke main shabd abhivyaktiyaan bhi shaamil hoti hai
 For example, a dog is also an animal like a cat, monkey, giraffe or rabbit and can also be a terrier, hound, German Shepherd or retriever
 dhyaan dene ke baat yah he ki ye teenon rup kisi suparibhaashit bhashaai pranali ke bheetar arth rachane ke kaam zarur aate hai, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki arth-grahan or arth- rachana kii saamaajik or saamudayik prakriyaayein bhi unki mohataaj hoti hon
 For example, there can also be a community that constructs the meaning of words without these three relations, that is, outside the realm of language
 uttar america main hopi ek aisa he pakshiyon chhod sabhi vaali chizon ke liye alag-alag ke bajaay ek hi shabd kaa istemaal hota he
 The people of this clan give the name 'masayataka' to a mosquito, balloon and plane or something similar
 vaakyon ke madhyam se shabdaarth grahan karnaa bhi cementics ke daayre main aata he
 'ramesh bought house from Umesh' is actually synonymous with 'umesh sold house to Ramesh'
 isi tarah kaa samanarthak sambandh ‘police ne andolankariyon ko girakrataar kar liya’ kaa ‘andolankaaree police dwaara girakrataar kar liye gayi’ ke bich he
 Similarly, other meanings are formed between sentences
 udhaaharan ke liye ‘america commando unit ke haathon osama bin laden maaraa gaya’ or ‘osama bin laden maaraa gaya’ ke bich kaa arth-sambandh dekha ja saktaa he
 If according to the first sentence, the US commando unit has actually killed Osama, then the second sentence also wants to represent the reality that will be accepted as true
 arth ke lihaaz se ek vaakya kii duusare par nirbharta ke saath- saath vaakya apane arth ke liye usamen antarnihit purv-manyata par bhi nirbhar karte hai
 Such as: 'according to a statement of the Ministry of Defense, India should exercise the powers to prevent Pakistan from promoting cross-border terrorism'
 is vaakya main do purv- manyataayen nihit hai : pehali, bharat ke paas aavashyak shaktiyaan hai or duusari, pakistan seemaa-paar aatankwaad ko protsaahit kar rahaa he
 In the last ten years, there has been tremendous linguistic work in the fields of Cementics and Pragmatics
 vaakyon or shabdon ke arthon ke bich antar karne vaali ye cementic kavayaden upar se dekhne main bahut maamuli lag sakati hai, par kisi ibaarat main antarnihit vichaardhaaratmak taatparyon or daavedaariyon ko saamne laane ke liye inaki ahmiyat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Economic changes can also be studied in several terms of political science by taking the help of cementics and pragmatics
 masalan, loktantr kaa arth arestu ke jamaane se lekar kaafii dinon tak saadhaaran logon yaa unki bheed ke tantra yani avyavasthit or arajak pranali ke rup main lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 But today democracy has become rigid in the sense of a working system according to a systematic procedure
 isliye jaise hi koi maang yaa andolan kii prakriyaaon sidhe hastkshep kii maang karata he, use vyavastha ke liye khatara qaraar diya jane lagata he
 The entire revolution movement under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan in India created similar economic anxiety by demanding the right of representative return
 anna hajaare ke netritv main chale bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ne bhi loktantr se judi arth-sambandhi samasyaon ko pesh kiya he
 Now it is the job of philosophers and thinkers of democracy to make an economical explanation of this change in the meaning of democracy
