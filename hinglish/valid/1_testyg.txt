 The reasons for the recent increase in heat, despite scientific consensus, are the subject of research that most of the heat generated by the increase in greenhouse gases of the atmosphere due to human activities has been observed since the beginning of the industrial era

 It is the process by which the absorption and emission of infrared radiation into the atmosphere by hot gases is reduced to another planet's surface in the atmosphere
 greenhouse prabhaav ke rup main astitv is prakaar vivaadit nahin he
 Naturally possessing greenhouse gases means a heat effect of about 33 ° C, which will not be habitable on Earth
 
prithvi par mahatvapurn grinhause gaisen hai, jal-vaashp, jo ki 36–70 pratishat tak greenhouse prabhaav paidaa karata he ) ; carbon dioxide jo 9-26 pratishat tak greenhouse prabhaav paidaa karata he; methane 4-9 pratishat tak or ozone, jo 3-7 pratishat tak prabhaav paidaa karti he imuxxa yah he ki maanviya gatividhiyon se jab kuch greenhouse gaison kii vayumandaleey sandratha badhati he tab greenhouse prabhaav kii shakti kaise parivartit hoti he
 Human activity has increased since the Industrial Revolution, which has led to a significant increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, which has also led to greatly increased diffuse bound CO 2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC and s nitrous
 Methane is more effective than greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but its concentration is so low that its radiative strength is only one f, compared to carbon dioxide
 Some other gases that are naturally occurring contribute to the greenhouse effect
 inmen se ek nitras oxide krishi jaisi maanviya gatividhiyon ke kaaran apana vikaas kar rahi he!co2 or CH4 kii vaataavaran sandratha 1700 veen sadi ke madhya main audyogic kranti kii shuruyaat ke baad se kramshah 31% or 149% bad gai he
 These levels are considered to be significantly higher than at any point during the last 650,000 years
 yah vah avadhi he jiske liye vishwasaneey aankade aais cor s

 With less direct geological evidence, it is believed that the last such high amount of CO2 was 200 million years ago
 jeevashm eendhan ke jalane se pichley 20 varshon main maanviya gatividhiyon se CO2 main hui badhotari main kam se kam ek tihaai vruddhi he
 The remaining work is due to changes in the use of land, especially due to deforestation
 CO2 kii vartmaan vasayumandaleey sandratha aaytan kii drushti se lagbhag 385 prati das lakh pipiem) he
 There is a possibility of higher CO2 levels in the future as there is a lot of change in fossil fuels and land use
 The rate of increase will depend on uncertain economic, social, technological and natural phenomena but perhaps the availability of fossil fuels will ultimately prove to be the deciding factor
 Special report on emissions scenarios of the future tells of several future CO2 scenarios that last from the late 2100s to 541 to 970p Can be up to PM

 The effects of climate factors on climate are complicated by various processes
 sarvaadhik spasht pratyuttaron main se ek kaa sambandh jal ke vashpikaran se he
 The heat produced by the mixing of long-term greenhouse effect gases such as carbon dioxide causes a greater amount of water vaporization in the atmosphere
 kyunki jal-vaashp khud ek greenhouse gas he, isliye isse vaataavaran or bhi zyada garm ho jaataa he or isse or bi zyada pani vaashp main badalata he ) or yah pratikriya chalati rahati he jabatak ki punanirveshan chakra par roak na lag jaae
akele carbon daai oxide se hone vaale iskaa prabhaav bahut vishaal hoga
 Although this process of reaction increases the air moisture particles, the relative humidity either remains constant or decreases slightly as the air heats up
 pratyuttar kaa yah prabhaav keval dhire dhire hi ulta ho saktaa he kyonki carbon daai oxide main dirghakaalin vayumandaleey jivanavadhi hoti he
 Cloud-affected responses are a continuous process

 Whether the net effect is hot or cold depends on details like cloud type and height
 jalwaayu ke pratimaanon par in vivaranon ko pradarshit karnaa kathin hota he kyonki jalwaayu pratimaanon ke sanganak khaanon par rikt sthanon ke binduon ke bich kii tulana main badal bahut chote hote hai
 As the atmosphere gets warmer, the advisory response process is related to the change in the lapse rate
 kshobhamandal unchai main badhotari hone ke saath-saath vayumandal kaa taapmaana ghatata jaataa he
 The emission of infrared radiation depends on the fourth power of temperature, longer radiation is emitted from the top layer of the atmosphere and less than the lower layer
 zyaadaatar vikiran jo upari vaataavaran se utsarjit hoti he khala main chali jaati he, jabaki nichle vaataavaran se utsarjit hone vaali vikiran dobaaraa vatavarav dwaara sokh lee jaati he
 Thus, the greenhouse effect depends on the speed at which the temperature in the atmosphere decreases with elevation, if the temperature rate is low then the greenhouse effect will be higher and if the rate of temperature fall is low then the greenhouse effect will be less
 siddhant or model donon yah sanket karte hai ki varming se oonchai ke saath taapmaana kaa girnaa kam ho jayega, jisase ek nakaaratmak lapse rate feedback paidaa ho jayega or isse green house asar kamazor hoga
 The measurement of the rate of temperature change with altitude is very sensitive to small errors, which makes it very difficult to find whether the model matches the reality
 ek or mahatvapurn prakriya he aais'albedo pratyuttarajab vaishvik taapmaana main vruddhi hoti he, tab dhruvon ke paas barf tej dar se pighalane lagati he
 As the snow melts, so does the land or open water take its place
 bhoomi or jal donon hi barf kii tulana main kam paravartak hote hai or isiilie saura vikiran ko adhik maatra main sokh lete hai
 This causes more heat due to which more ice starts melting and this cycle goes on
 sakaramaatak punanirveshan jo kii CO2 or CH4 ke utsarjan ke kaaran hota he ek anya kaaran he jo varming ko badhaata he
 These gases originate from the marsh in the freezing wood, siberia, such as freezing Permfrost

 The land in the northern hemisphere is more jiada, so it heats up faster than the southern hemisphere
 Seasonal ice and sea in the northern hemisphere There are extensive areas of ice that depend on ice-albedo feedback in the northern hemisphere, more than in the southern hemisphere
 Green house gases are emitted, but it is not responsible for the difference in heat as the major greenhouse gases stay for a long time and mix well in both hemispheres

 These models are based on the physical principles of fluid dynamics, radiative transfer and other processes, simplification has been done on cut wakes because computers have their own limitations and the hydrological system is very complex
 Surrey modern climate models are an abstract model in itself
 And this is different with the model of the sea and the model of ice on land and sea
 In some models chemical and biological Treatments of processes are also involved
 This model finds that if the effect of greenhouse gases is added, a warmer climate is attained
 Nevertheless, even when this assumption is used, climate sensitivity still has a large role

 Putting x3 = u in the above equation gives the following equation- jo sugyaat dwighat sameekaran he or isse u kaa maan nikaal ja saktaa he
 In this case, the original variable can be estimated
 iske liye u ko x3 ke baraabar karne par: If x is a real number, nimnlikhit yugapat samikarnon ko dekhen- Where x { \ displaystyle x} and y { \ displaystyle y} are positive integers and x> y { \ displaystyle x> y}

 But if you understand the second equation as xy = 880 { \ displaystyle xy = 880} and replace s = x + y, t = xy { \ displaystyle s = x + y, t = xy} then this equation s + t = 71, st = 880
 { \ displaystyle s + t = 71, st = 880
} The solution is: = { \ displaystyle =} or =
 { \ displaystyle =
} On reinstalling this solution, x + y = 16, xy = 55 { \ displaystyle x + y = 16, xy = 55}, which will give the solution easily
 yah hal he- =

 He tricked the Pandavas many times and encouraged his nephew Duryodhana to do devious tricks towards the Pandavas
 uluk shakuni va aarshi kaa putr tha
 Shakuni was born to Subal and Empress Sudarma, the emperor of Gandhar
 shakuni kii bahan gandhari kaa vivaah dhritarashtra se hua tha
 The reason for Shakuni's hatred for the Kuru dynasty was that Bhishma, the commander of Hastinapur, once went to Gandhar to demand Gandhari's hand for Dhritarashtra
 tab gandhari ke pita subal ne ye baat sweekaar kar lee, lekin us samay unhen ye pataa nahin tha kii dhritarashtra janmaandh he
 Shakuni also opposed this, but Gandhari had by now considered Dhritarashtra as her husband
 isliye shakuni ne us din ye pran liya kii vah samooche kuruvansh ke sarvanaash kaa kaaran banegaa
 After dividing the Hastinapur kingdom into two equal pieces, one part, which was completely barren, was given to the Pandavas, which they, with their untiring efforts, converted it into a beautiful city called Indraprastha
 sheeghra hi vahaan kii bhavyata ki charchaayen dur-dur tak hone lageen
 On the occasion of the Rajasuya Yajna performed by Yudhishthira, Duryodhana also had the opportunity to visit that grand city
 vah rajmahal kii bhavyata dekh rahaa tha, ki ek sthaan par usne pani kii tal vaali sajaavat ko thos bhoomi samaj liya or pani me gir gaya
 Duryodhana considered it an insult and returned to Hastinapur
 apane bhaanje kii yah maansik sthiti bhaanpakar, shakuni ne man main pandavon kaa rajpaat chhinane kaa kutil vichaar aayaa
 He invited the Pandavas to play Chaucer and, using his devious intelligence, first asked Yudhishthira to make small claims
 jab yudhisthir khel chhodane kaa man banaata to shakuni dwaara kuch naa kuch kahkar yudhisthir se koi naa koi daav lagava letaa
 In this way, Maharaj Yudhishthira continued to defeat all his things by putting all his things on the daava and in the end he also put his brothers and his wife on the dao and lost them too and thus by insulting Draupadi, Duryodhana took his vengeance
 And took the foundation of the war of Mahabharata on the same day

 Especially during this time, the Saljuq Turks greatly increased their power from the Caspian Sea to Jerusalem
 udhar purv main turkon kii ek duusari shakha ne sultan mahmud ke netritv main bharat par akraman kiya or uskaa pashchimottar bhaag dabaa liya
 The Saljuqs also occupied the internecine Palestine of many countries, and Jerusalem and its holy places became subject to it in 1071 AD

 On the other hand, the power of the Norman race developed in Western Europe

 Their navy grew and the Christians also got a new route to their sacred land

 In 395 AD, the Roman Empire was divided into two parts
 pashchimi bhaag, jisaki rajdhani rome thi, 476 main uttar kii barbar jatiyon ke akraman se tut gaya
 But the influence of the Pope remained constant and greatly increased when these nations became Christians; Even the Pope had unquestioned dominance over Western Europe

 His belief was that only with the establishment of Norman rule in this empire could Turkey win the war

 Seeing this trend, the eastern emperor took him across the Basphorus without waiting for another party when he reached Constantine city
 vahaan se badhkar jab ve turko dwaara shasit kshetra main ghuse to, maare gaye
 The second party was the armies of many well-deserved feudatories from Western Europe who reached Constantine by different routes
 inke naam is prakaar hai:- The eastern emperor promised these armies in exchange for the facilities of navigation and military support, and promised them that the former territories of the empire, which were captured by the Turks, would be given to the emperor if they were won
 yadhyapi is pratigya kaa puraa paalan nahin hua or samrat kii sahaayta yathesht nahin praapt hui, phir bhi krushdhar senaaon ko is yuddh main paryaapt safalataa mili
 As soon as they were confronted, the Turks gave the city and its related territories to the emperor
 phir sena ne dorilium sthaan par turko ko parajeet kiya ore vahaan se antiok main pahunchakar aath maheene ke ghere ke baad use jeet liya
 Before this, Baldwin separated his army and took possession of the state of Edessa under Armenia on the east

 gokul singh athwa gokula sinsini gaanv kaa sardaar tha
 On 10 May 1666, the Jats and Aurangzeb's army fought at Tilpat
 ladaai main jaaton kii vijay hui
 The Mughal rule promoted the religion of Islam and raised taxes on peasants
 gokula ne kisaanon ko sangathit kiya or kar jamaa karne se manaa kar diya
 Aurangzeb sent a very powerful army
 gokula ko bandi bana liya gaya or 1 janvari 1670 ko agra ke kile par janata ko aatankit karne ke liye tukde-tukade kar maaraa gaya
 The sacrifice of Gokula marked the beginning of the accounts of Mughal rule
 mughal samrajya ke rajput sevak bhi andar hi andar asantusht hone lage parantu jaisaa ki "dalpat vilaas" ke lekhak dalpat singh ne spasht kaha he, rajput netagan mughal shashan ke viruddh vidroh karne kii himmat na kar sake
 Some Jat leaders and zamindars of Uttar Pradesh got credit for pioneering rebellion against intolerant, religious, policy
 agra, mathura, aligarh, isamen agrani rahe
 In the last years of Shah Jahan, during the succession war, Jat leader Veer Nandram refused to pay rent in protest of the exploitative religious policy and hoisted the flag of rebellion
 Later, Uday Singh and Gokulsingh took the place of Veer Nandram
 itihaas ke is tathy ko sweekaar karnaa padegaa kii rathore vir durgadas ke pehle hi uttar pradesh ke jat veeron ko kattarpanthi mogul samraaton kii ashishnu nitiyon kaa purvabhaas ho chukaa tha
 Gokul Singh was the leader of all the Hindu masses of Mathura, Vrindavan, Govardhan and Hindaun and Mahavan, the fortress of Tilpat was its center
 jab koi bhi mogul senapati use parrast nahin kar sakaa to ant main samraat aurangzeb ko swayan ek vishaal sena lekar jan-aakrosh kaa daman karnaa padaa
 Today, if there is any credit to the temple of Mathura, Vrindavan and the defense of Indian culture and for turning the direction of immediate exploitation, tyranny and state arbitrariness, it is only to 'gokulsingh'
 is baat kii chetana kam hi logon ko hogi ki veeravar gokulasinh kaa balidaan, guru tegbahadur se 6 varsh purv hua tha
 In December 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was slaughtered - on the platform of the Mughal Kotwali of Delhi, where today the gurudwara stands raised with the head of Shishganj
 guru ke dwaara sheesh dene ke kaaran hi vah gurudwara sheeshganj kehalaata he
 On the other hand, when we look at the great man who was martyred 6 years before Guru Tegh Bahadur and was martyred for the same values and not on the Kotwali of Delhi, on the tall platform of Agra's Kotwali, thousands of people In front of the crowd chanting, they were brought up in iron chains and which, with great vampirism, intended to break the morale of the public, each one with axes Cut was executed, then do not we have a look
 gokulasinh sirf jaaton ke liye shahid nahin hue the na unka rajya hi kisi ne chhina liya tha, na koi pension band kardi thi, balki unke saamne to apurv shaktishaalee mogul-satta, deentapurvak, sandhi karne kii tamanna lekar gid-gidai thi
 Shame that we could not even honor such a wonderful hero on paper
 kitna ahsaan faraamosh kitna kritaghnn he hamaara hindu samaaj ! shahi itihaaskaaron ne unka ullekh tak nahin kiya
 The arrest and slaughter of Guru Teghbahadur is not mentioned in any contemporary Persian historiography
 mewar ke rana pratap se ladane akbar swayan nahin gaya tha parantu braj ke un jat yoddhaon se ladane use swayan janaa padaa tha
 However, they could not be completely suppressed and under the command of the chosen generals, the Mughal armies continued to be sent for the oppression and oppression of the Jats and not only Jat men but their heroes also faced those armies with their historical fortitude and traditional valor
 She stayed
 durbhaagya kii baat he ki bharat kii in viranganaon or sachche sapooton kaa koi ullekh shahi tukdon par palane vaale tathakthith itihaaskaaron ne nahin kiya
 We get their information from the accounts of European traveler named Manuchi
 usee ke shabdon main ek anokhaa chitra dekhiye, jo anya kisi desh yaa jati ke itihaas main durlabh he: Sir Yadunath Sarkar writes - “as a result of the religious policy of Muslims, there has always been a special blow to the holy land of Mathura
 dilli se agra jane vaale rajmarg par sthit hone ke kaaran, mathura kii ore sadaiv vishesh dhyaan aakarshith hota rahaa he
 To suppress the Hindus there, Aurangzeb appointed a staunch Muslim named Abdunnavi as the Faujdar of Mathura
 san 1678 ke prarambh main abdunnavi ke sainikon kaa ek dasta mathura janapad main chaaron ore lagaan vasuuli karne niklaa
 abdunnavi ne pichley hi varsh, gokulasinh ke paas ek nai chhavnee sthapit kii thi
 This was the sad point of all action
 gokulasinh ke aahvaan par kisaanon ne lagaan dene se inkaar kar diya
 mogul sainikon ne luutmaar se lekar kisaanon ke dhor-dangar tak kholane shuru kar die
 bas sangharsh shuru ho gaya
 Then Aurangzeb's new decree came 9 April 1669 - "madrasas and temples of infidels be dropped"
 As a result, many ancient temples and monasteries of the Braj region were destroyed
 kushaan or gupt kaaleen nidhi, itihaas kii amuly dharohar, tod-phod, mund viheen, ang viheen kar hajaaron kii sankhya main sarvatra chhitara di gayi
 Mughalia horsemen and vulture eagles were seen flying throughout the Brajmandal
 or dikhaai dete the dhune ke badal or laplapaati jwalaayen- unamem se nikalate hue saahi ghudsavaar
 The month of May has come and the end of the tyrannical military has also arrived Abdunnavi besieged a village called Sihora
 Gokulsingh was also nearby
