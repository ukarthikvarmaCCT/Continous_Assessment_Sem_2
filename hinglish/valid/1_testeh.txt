 were recognized from there
 ayurveda chikitsa-paddati kaa bahutayat main upyog hota tha
 Surgery was also done when needed
 baad main to arabon tathaa unaniyon ne bhi shalya-chikitsa ko apanaaya
 Then, in the Rome Empire, demand for Indian herbs also started in the field of medicine
 usee samay vanaspatiyon or jantuon ke bahya tathaa aantarik sanrachanaon ke adhyayan bhi kiye gaye
 The method of crop rotation was also followed to increase soil fertility in agriculture
 bharat main vaigyanik pragati kaa swarna kaal isa se purv chauthi shatabdi se lekar isa ke baad chhathi yaa saatvin shatabdi tak rahaa
 Sciences like metallurgy, physics, chemistry were also developed in this era
 mauryaal main yuddh ke liye astron or shastron kaa vikaas kiya gaya tha
 Some mechanical weapons, such as the development of projectors and the use of engineering in irrigation are notable
 is kaal main bhu-surveykshan kii takanic atyant viksit thi
 The use of many types of scientific skills in the construction of giant stone pillars is another feature of this era
 iske baad guptkaal main vigyaan kii sabhi shakhaon main ullekhneey pragati hui
 The development of seed mathematics, geometry, chemistry, physics, metallurgy, medicine, astronomy was at its peak
 is yug main anek khyaati praapt vaigyanik hue jinke anusandhanon or avishkaron kaa loha tatkaaleen sabhy samaaj ke log maanate the
 This science developed in India itself
 prasiddh german khagolvigyaani copernicus se lagbhag 1000 varsh purv aryabhatta ne prithvi kii gol akruti or iske apni dhari par ghoomane kii pushti kar di thi
 Similarly, 1000 years before Isaac Newton, Brahmagupta confirmed the Earth's gravitational theory
 yah ek alag baat he ki kinhin kaarnon se inkaa shrey paashchaatya vaigyanikon ko mila
 The origin of Indian astronomy is believed to be from the Vedas
 vedikkaleen bhartiya dharmapraan vyakti the
 They performed their Yajna and other religious rituals according to the position of the planets by observing auspicious lagna
 shubh lagn jaanane ke liye unhone khagol vigyaan kaa vikaas kiya tha
 The Vedic Aryans were familiar with the Uttarayan and Dakshinayana motions of the Sun
 vedikkaleen khagol vigyaan kaa ek maatr granth ‘vedang jyotish’ he
 It was composed by a sage named 'lagadh' about 100 years before Christ
 mahabharat main bhi khagol vigyaan se sambandhit jaankaree milti he
 There is a discussion of lunar eclipse and solar eclipse in Mahabharata
 is kaal ke logon ko gyaat tha ki grahan keval amavasya or poornima ko hi lag sakate hai
 People of this period also had good knowledge about planets
 ‘vedang jyotish’ ke baad lagbhag ek hajaar varshon tak khagol vigyaan kaa koi granth nahin miltaa
 In the fifth century, Aryabhata first told the people that the Earth is round and revolves around its axis
 unhone prithvi ke aakaar, gati or paridhi kaa anumaan bhi lagaaya tha
 Aryabhata discovers the true causes of the Sun and lunar eclipses
 unke anusaar chandramaa or prithvi kii parchaai padane se grahan lagata he
 The moon does not have its own light, it is illuminated by sunlight
 isi prakaar aryabhatta ne rahu-ketu dwaara surya or chandra ko gras lene ke siddhant kaa khandan kiya or grahan kaa sahi vaigyanik siddhant pratipaadit kiya
 Aryabhata wrote the texts 'aryabhatiya' and 'arya Siddhant'
 aryabhatta ke baad chhathi shatabdi main varahamihir naam ke khagol vaigyanik hue
 He was the first person in the history of science to say that there is such a power, which keeps things tied to the ground
 aaj isi shakti ko gurutvkarshan kehete hai
 Varahamihira said that the earth is round, on whose surface mountains, rivers, trees, trees, etc
 are spread
 ‘panchasiddhantika’ or ‘suryasiddhant’ unki khagol vigyaan sambandhi pustaken hai
 Apart from these, Varahamihira has also written books named ‘vrhatsamhita’ and ‘vrihajatak’
 iske baad bhartiya khagol vigyaan main brahmagupta kaa bhi kaafii mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Their tenure is believed to date from the seventh century
 ve khagol vigyaan sambandh gananaaon main sambhawatah bijganit kaa prayog karne vaale bharat ke sabase pehle mahaan ganitagya the
 'brahmagupta Siddhant' is his major work
 iske atirikt jivan ke antim varshon main brahmagupta ne ‘khand khaadyak’ naamak granth bhi likhaa tha
 He has described the speed and position of various planets, methods for calculating their rise and fall, yuti and solar eclipse
 brahmagupta kaa grahon kaa gyaan pratyaksh vedh par adhrith tha
 They believed that whenever there was a difference between calculation and perforation, the calculation should be purified by perforation
 ye prithvi ko gol maanate the tathaa puraanon main prithvi ko chapati maanane ke vichaar kii inhone kadi aalochana kii he
 Brahmagupta was also critical of the theory of Aryabhatta revolving around the earth with his own theories
 brahmagupta prithvi kii aakarshan shakti ke siddhant se sahamat the
 According to him 'things fall towards the earth because it is the nature of the earth to attract them towards them
 ’ Bhaskaracharya has a distinctive contribution to astronomy after Brahmagupta
 inkaa samay barahavin shatabdi tha
 He was a proud scholar of mathematics
 inhone ‘siddhantshiromani’ or ‘karan kutuhal’ naamak do granthon kii rachana kii thi
 As an astronomer, Bhaskaracharya is famous for his concept of 'instantaneous speed'
 isse khagol vaigyanikon ko grahon kii gati kaa sahi gyaan praapt karne main madad milti he
 Bhaskar had rehearsed the German astrologer Kepler's rule of removing the surface of the sphere and its cube
 duusare unhone satrahavin shatabdi main janme ijac newton se lagbhag 500 varsh purv gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya tha
 Most discoveries and inventions that Europe is so proud of today were impossible without a developed mathematical method
 yah paddati bhi sambhav nahin ho paati yadi europe baari-bharkam roman ankon ke bandhan main jakadaaa rahata
 The unknown person who discovered the new method was the son of India
 madhyayugin bhartiya ganitagyon, jaise brahmagupta, mahavir or bhaskar ne aisi kai khoje kin, jinase punarjagran kaal yaa uske baad tak bhi europe aparichit tha
 There is no difference in the fact that India had a high-quality tradition of mathematics
 harappakalin samskruti ke log avashya hi ankon or sankhyaon se parichit rahe honge
 Because of the unreadable script of this era, nothing can be said for sure
 lekin bhawan, sadakon, naaliyon, snanagaron aadi ke nirmaan main ankon or sankhyaon kaa nishchit rup se upyog hua hoga
 Was weighing and trading possible without numbers and numbers? After reading the script of Harappan culture, many new facts will surely be revealed
 iske baad vedikkaleen bhartiya ankon or sankhyaon kaa upyog karte the
 Medhatithi, a sage of the Vedic era, was familiar with large numbers up to 1012
 ve apni gananaaon main das or iske gunakon kaa upyog karte the
 'yajurveda Samhita' chapter 17, Mantra 2 mentions the number up to 10, xxwrep 2 00, 000
 isa se 100 varsh purv kaa jain granth ‘anuyog dwaar sutara’ he
 It has been calculated up to innumerable, with a magnitude equal to 10140
 us samay yunaan main badi-se-badi sankhya kaa naam 'miriod' tha, jo 10,000 the or rome ke logon kii badi-se-badi sankhya kaa naam milli tha, jo 1000 thi
 Zero was used by Pingal in his Chhandasutra 200 years before Christ
 iske baad to shunya kaa upyog anek granthon main kiya gaya he
 But Brahmagupta was the first Indian mathematician to formulate rules for using zero
 inke anusaar- He said wrongly that divide by zero then the result is zero because today we know that it is an infinite number
 ab yah nirvivaad rup se siddh ho gaya he ki sansar ko sankhyaayein likhane kii aadhunik pranali bharat ne hi di he
 The people of Harappan culture also had knowledge of geometry
 eenton kii akruti, bhawanon kii akruti, sadakon kaa samakon par kaatna is baat kaa dyotak he ki us kaal ke logon ko jyamiti kaa gyaan tha
 In the Vedic period, the Aryans used the knowledge of geometry to create altars of yajna
 ‘shulbasutra’ main varg or aayat banane kii vidhi di hui he
 Regarding the relation of the arm, questions like rectangles like squares, circles like squares etc
 have been considered in this book
 kisi trikon ke baraabar varg khinch aisa varg bananaa jo kisi varg kaa do guna, teen guna athwa ek tihaai ho, aisa varg bananaa, jiskaa kshetrafal upasthit varg ke kshetra ke baraabar ho, ityadi kii reetiyaan bhi ‘shulb sutara’ main di gai hai
 Aryabhatta has established the ratio of circumference and diameter of the circle to 3
1416
 unhone pehali baar kaha ki yah pai kaa sannikat maan he
 The work that Indians did in the field of trigonometry is inimitable and fundamental
 inhone jya, kotigya or utkramajya kaa avishkaar kiya
 Europe's knowledge of trigonometry in Varahamihira's 'surya Siddhant' was acquired by Briggs in the sixteenth century
 brahmagupta ne bhi trikonmiti par likhaa he or ek jya sarini bhi di he
 Indians also gained great proficiency in algebra
 aryabhatta, brahmagupta, bhaskaracharya, shridharacharya aadi prasiddh ganitagya the
 The biggest achievement in the field of algebra is 'to present the solution of the essential square equation'
 paashchaatya ganit ke itihaas main is sameekaran ke hal kaa shrey ‘jon pel’ ko diya jaataa he or ise ‘pel sameekaran’ ke naam se hi janaa jaataa he, parantu vaastaviktaa yah he ki pel se ek hajaar varsh purv brahmagupta ne is sameekaran kaa hal prastut kar diya tha
 For this, two theorems were discovered by Brahmagupta
 anivaary varg sameekaran ke liye bhartiya naam varg-prakruti he
 There is a long tradition of medical science in India
 chikitsa shaastra ko veda tulya sammaan diya gaya he
 This is the reason why the Indian system of medicine is distinguished by the noun of Ayurveda
 bhartiya chikitsa paddati ke vishay main sarvapratham likhit gyaan ‘atharvaveda’ main miltaa he
 In the Atharvaveda, Bhaishya sutras are used for the treatment of various diseases

 In this Samhita, Sushruta has given a systematic form by compiling the knowledge and experiences of the surgeons before him
 apni samhita main unhone likhaa he ki chikitsa vigyaan ke viddhrthi mrit sharir ke vichchhedan se apane kaary main kushal banate hai
 According to Sushruta, autopsy is a process
 sushrut ne shalya chikitsa ke liye 101 upkarnon kii suchi bhi di he
 He said that in addition to these, the equipment should be prepared on its own
 unki suchi main chimatiyaan, chaaku, suiyaan, salaaiyaan tathaa nalika akruti ke ve sab upkaran hai jinka prayog aaj kaa shalya chikitsak karata he
 He has also spoken of sterilizing the equipment before surgery

5 meter unchaa ek pracheen louh stambh karnataka kii parvat shrunkhalaaon main khadaa he
 There is no effect of war on this either
 yahi nahin urisa ke konark mandir main lagbhag 10
5 meter lanbaa tathaa 90 ton ke bhaar vaala lohe kaa stambh bhi aaj tak jangvihin he
 Not only this, the construction of such a huge pillar is an amazing achievement of the medieval system of India
 loha hi nahin sona, chaandi, tanba, tin, jasta jaisi anek dhaatuon ke ayask khojane tathaa unhen galaakar shuddh dhaatu praapt karne main bhartiya vaigyanikon ko maharath hasil thi

 vigyaan kii anya anek shakhaon main bharat kii ucchkoti kii uplabdhiyaan thim
 After the tenth century, all the northern India was invaded by foreign invaders
 chaaron ore avyavashtha or araajaktaa thi
 In such a situation, who was conscious of doing scientific research
 keval dakshin bharat ke kuch bhaagon main vaigyanik gatividhiyaan chalati raheen
 After the arrival of the British, sporadic battles continued for a long time
 angrejon kaa lagbhag puure bharat par aadhipaty ho jane ke baad vigyaan ke kshetra main kuch bharatiyon ne mahatvapurn uplabdhiyaan praapt kin
 The development of modern scientific tradition in India began mainly after the establishment of the East India Company
 yahan ek baat mukhya rup se dhayaan dene kii he
 That is, the modern scientific tradition is not very different from the ancient scientific tradition
 balki usee ko aage badhaane vaali ek kadi ke rup main viksit hui he
 There is a fundamental difference in the development of both traditions, that is the development of mechanics
 pracheen bhartiya parampara ne vigyaan ke vibhinn kshetron main to kaafii teji se vikaas kar liya tha, kintu yantriki yani masini str par koi mahatvapurn uplabdhi hasil nahin kii
 The modern scientific tradition differentiates itself from the ancient scientific tradition from here
 puure aadhunik paridrishy ko dekhen to aadhunik vaigyanik parampara kii sabase badi uplabdhi rahi he, yantriki kaa vikaas
 Whatever ancient scientific achievements were made till now, mechanics were developed by basing them and this tradition became prevalent all over the world
 phir yantriki ke vikaas se vigyaan main nae anusandhanon ke anek raste khule, jaise - computer ke vikaas se rasayan, bhautik, jeev vigyaan aadi har kshetra main nae-nae prayogon main aasaani ho gai
 The main reason behind the spread of modern scientific tradition in the whole world simultaneously - British rule in most countries of the world
 isi prakaar jis bhi yantric athwa vaigyanik parampara kaa vikaas hua vah thode-se antar par athwa ek-saath puri duniya main prachlit ho gai
 Therefore, modern scientific tradition also broke the boundaries of country and time
 isi tarah alag-alag deshon ke vaigyanikon ne to apane str par vaigyanik uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hi, duusare vaigyanikon kii khojon se prerana lekar kai nai khojein bhi kin or saath hi dusron kii khojon ko bhi aage badhaayaa
 In this way, while studying the development of the Indian modern scientific tradition, we will need to mainly focus on two sides - 1
 aadhunik bharat kii moulik vaigyanik parampara or 2
 Mixed scientific tradition of modern India is parampara ke antargat un vaigyanik khojon ko rakhaa ja saktaa he, jo bharat main janme or bharat main hi rahakar, yaheen ke sansadhano se yaheen vaigyanik khojein kin or duniya ke saamne misaal kaayam kii
 Although most of the scientific discoveries were made by the British after the arrival of the British, but along with them Indian scientists also made many experiments and achievements

 The phrase "heart attack" is sometimes used incorrectly to describe sudden cardiac death that may or may not result in acute myocardial infarction
 a heart attack differs from this, but may be the cause of complete cardiac arrest that prevents heart palpitations and abnormal heartbeat arrhythmias
 It is also different from heart failure, in which the heart is unable to pump; Severe infarction may cause heart failure, but it does not have to be
 2007 main ek aam sahmati ke dastauez ne rodhgalan ko mukhya rup se paanch prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya he: Symptoms in myocardial infarction usually begin slowly for several minutes and rarely occur suddenly
 Symptoms of acute myocardial infarction are common in chest pain and often feel a sensation of grip, pressure, or squeeze
 Chest pain due to endemic anemia of the heart muscle is called angina pectoris
 Pain is usually most common in the left arm, but pain may spread to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and epigastric region, where it can act as a heart burn
 Levine sign, in which the patient feels chest pain by folding in the ureter, is generally considered a future indicator of cardiac chest pain, although a prospective observational study showed that it had a weak positive prospective indicator value

 Bizarre reports from women and adult patients counterparts have more symptoms than men and youth
 Symptoms are more reported in women than men
 Among the most common symptoms of MI in women are dyspnea, weakness and fatigue
 Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and dyspnea are often found to be symptoms that can be up to a month long before the actual clinically manifest ischemic event
 Coronary ischemia is less likely to occur due to chest pain in women than men

 The rate of heart attack associated with rapid use is high, it is mental stress or physical exertion, especially if the exertion is intense compared to the normal exertion of the individual
 Quantitative, extreme exertion and eventual convalescence are associated with physically fit people with an infarction of about 6 times higher rate
 The rate difference is 35 times higher for physically challenged people
 An increased mechanism for this phenomenon has been observed to be arterial pulse pressure stretching and arterial relaxation with each heartbeat seen with intravascular ultrasound, a mechanical increase of "shear stress" on the possibility of atheroma and plaque rupture

 atheroslerosis ke liye jokhim kaarak rodhgalan ke liye aam kaarak hai: Many of these risk factors are variable, which is why many heart attacks can be prevented by maintaining a healthy lifestyle
 Physical activity, for example, is associated with a low risk profile
 Non-variable risk factors include age, sex, and history of premature heart attacks in the family, which is reflected as a genetic predisposition

 Studies of serological subjects found antibodies against antibodies levels to be typical of bacteria caused by periodontitis, although antibodies are more present with coronary heart disease
 Eriodontitis is a habit of cytokines and, in the midst of increased blood pressure levels to fibrinogen CRP, thus, may have an MI effect on other risk exposures through periodontitis factors
 Predictive research suggests that periodontal bacteria can promote the aggregation of platelets and further promote foam cell formation
 a role for specific periodontal bacteria has been suggested but has been established

 Acute myocardial infarction refers to a subtype of acute coronary syndrome, called non-st high myocardial infarction and ST high myocardial infarction, which is a manifestation of and most frequent of coronary artery disease
 The most common triggering event is an atherosclerotic coronary epicardial plaque resulting in total occlusion of the artery, which leads to a clot, which cascades into an atherosclerotic coronary epicardial plaque
 Atherosclerosis in plaques in the arterial wall is the gradual development of cholesterol and fibrous tissue, usually over decades
 Blood flow column irregularities are seen on angiography that reflect a narrowed arterial lumen and are the result of decades as atherosclerosis advances
 Plaques may become unstable, diffuse, and in addition promote a clot that innervates the artery; It can happen in a minute

 Injured heart tissue builds up electrical impulses more slowly than normal heart tissue
 Differences in conduction velocity between injured tissue and fine tissue may promote re-entry or develop an outcome that is thought to be the cause of multiple lethal arrhythmias
 The most severe of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation, a very rapid and chaotic heart rhythm that is the main cause of sudden cardiac death
 Another risk of arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia, which may or may not cause sudden cardiac death
 However, the result of ventricular tachycardia usually results in a faster heart rate which effectively prevents the heart from pumping blood
 This can cause cardiac output and blood pressure to dangerous levels, which may further lead to coronary ischemia and infarction

 Myocardial infarction can be diagnosed after assessing the patient's complaints and physical condition
 Confirm ECG changes, coronary angiograms and marker levels to help in the diagnosis of heart
 The ECG gives valuable clues to the coronary angiogram by identifying the site of damage to the coronary vessels or allowing contractions in the heart or obstructions
 In autopsy, a pathologist can make a diagnosis based on anatomopathological findings

 In popular law, myocardial infarction is usually a disease, but sometimes an injury can also occur
 This has an impact on non-fault insurance schemes such as worker compensation
 a heart attack does not usually involve this, however, it can be a work-related injury if it results from, for example, abnormal emotional stress or abnormal mental stress
 In addition, in some jurisdictions, a person working in certain occupations, such as a heart attack caused by a police officer, is classified by law or policy as duty-of-line
 In some countries or states, a person who has previously had myocardial infarction may be prevented from participating in an activity that threatens the lives of others, for example driving a car or flying an airplane

 The second uses in vitro engineered heart tissue, which is then transplanted in vivo
 The final approach involves inserting cells and / or a scaffold into the myocardium to create in situ engineered heart tissue

 For this reason, some socialist thinkers have also adopted individualism
 unke anusaar agar manushya swaabhaavik rup se saamaajik praani he to vyaktvaad kaa taatpary swa-hit tak simit na rah kar birdaraana sahyog or saamudayik jivan se judaa hona chahie
 In the nineteenth century, French socialist Jean Jourez called socialism to the logical end of individualism
 anthony gidence jaise samakaleen vidwaan teesri dhara kii numaaindgi karte hai
 Redefining individualism, he has seen an autonomous person as an active figure in an atmosphere of mutual dependence and reciprocity
 semual smiles ne 1859 main 'self-help' naamak kitaab likhi thi, jise vyaktvaad kii bible samajha jaataa he
 Smiles lauded the Victorian qualities of enterprise, concentration and sustainability, calling 'self-help' without any outside help the basis for a person's true development
 in vichaaron ko harbart spencer dwaara pratipaadit saamaajik darvinavaad ko sarvocch abhivyakti mili
 In this way Spencer tried to provide a biological basis to individualism
 in vichaaron ko assi ke dashak main regnomix or thatchrizeshan ke tahat nav-dakshinpanthi swar mila
 The new rightists attacked the philanthropic state as a 'culture of dependency'
 unki bhashaa main garib or berojgaar ‘welfaiyar janki’ qaraar de diye gayi
 Individualism is not only important as a normative principle, but it also has a methodological form
 iske tahat vyakti ke purv-sthapit model ke aadhaar par maan liya jaataa he ki uski aavashyaktaayen, kamanaayen or chaalak-tatva kya-kya ho sakate hai
 On the basis of this 'prescribed' and 'given' human nature, the principles of social settlement were formulated in the seventeenth century and in the twentieth century political science it was used to formulate the concept of intelligent selection
 vyaktvaad kii paddati ke mutabik hi clasical or nioclasical arthshaastra ke siddhanton kaa sutrikaran hua
 The biggest problem of methodological individualism is that it is non-social and non-historical
 maanviya prakruti samaaj-dar-samaaj badalati rahati he
 It cannot have any universally prescribed or paid form
 samudaay kaa prashn aate hi vyaktvaad ko aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Individualism has been criticized from time to time by socialist, communist, conservative, nationalist and most fascist thinkers
 in aalochanaon ke centre main mukhyatah do prashn hai : kya vyakti ko samudaay se swatantra or aatm- nirbhar hona chahie? kya aisa karne se saamaajik ekta asambhav nahin ho jaaegi or vyakti algaav va asuraksha kaa shikaar nahin ho jayega? The problem of individualism in Western philosophy first arose during the time of sophist thinkers, around the fifth century BCE
 mulat: yah saamaajik samasya thi
 The early regimes were founded on the valor of the warriors
 kalantar main, un praarambhik shaskaon ke vanshaj, parivaar tathaa unke sambandhiyon ke kul kuleen ban gaye the
 The warriors were his helpers and retainers
 sophist kaal ke unani samaaj main kulinon or yoddhaon kii hi ginati thi
 These were the facilities available to them
 kuleen samaaj paramparaon ko daivi bataakar saamaanya janon ke adhikaron kaa apharan kar rahaa tha
 In such circumstances, the Sophists tried to prove the traditions to be honorable
 sophiston main vayovruddh protagoras ne manushya ko sabhi vastuon kaa maandand ghoshit kiya
 The above statement of Protagoras is famous as the original source of individualism in the history of Western philosophy
 isi pratigya ke anuroop protagoras ne gyaan kii vyakhya main kaha, "ham vastuon ko nahin, pratyaksh ke vishyo ko jaanate hai
 Mentioning the common direct as the source of knowledge was the endorsement of the power and the value of the ordinary person on mental grounds
 " yah "alp" kii saidhantik satta ke viruddh saamanyat: gyaat "bahu" kii satta kaa samarthan tha
 But the dispute did not end
 aflatoon ne satta kii samasya par vichaar karte hue vastuon ke "saar" ko satta sweekaar kiya
 He called it a matter
 par vah "saar" vastuon ke virgon main vyas "saamaanya" tha
 In this way, he tried to show specific things to be inaccurate and to show their generalities as real
 aflatoon pratyaksh kii bahuta ko, uske saar kii pruthak satta maanakar, nissar evam asaty siddh karnaa chahta tha
 Aristotle did not immediately make any specific changes to the generalist philosophy of Aflatun, but he emphasized that "matter" and "shape" are the two contributory causes of the object
 inhen vastu se alag nahin kiya ja sakat
 That sounds fine
 vastuen keval sarabhoot gun to nahin ho saktin; keval saar samgr vastu kaa sthanapann kaise ho saktaa he, Following the philosophy of Aflatun and Aristotle, the Cynic and Stoic philosophers emphasized the power of material things and supported the freedom of the individual on moral grounds
 chhathi shatabdi main bithius ne, arestu kii "kaitagoriya" naamak pustak kaa porphiri krit parichay anudit kar, namawaad kaa maarg prashast kiya
 In the medieval period of Western philosophy, from the 11th to the 14th century, nominalist thinkers equated that the common suffix is nothing but the name, the real power is that of things
 is prasang main wiliam ov okhm kaa samaran kiya ja saktaa he
 He clearly said that only specific things are there
 inhen kii hamen aparokshanubhuti hoti he, jise ham nirnay ke madhyam se vyakt karte hai
 We create common suffixes, excluding the ordinary religions of objects
 kintu vivaad chalata rahaa
 They were not ready to place everything in the nutritious world of tradition
 aadhunik kaal main, german darshanik emanuel kaant ke samay tak, bahya jagat kii bahuta ko asaty siddh karne ke prayatnon kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa
 Natural sciences also continued to develop
 is vikaas ne pratyaksh kaa bhraamak maanane main aadchan paidaa kar di thi
 Kant, himself a scholar of science, accepted the power of things
 usne jagat kii bhramaatmakataa ko kaayam rakhaa, kintu gyaan kii prakriya ko iske liye uttaradaayi tehraaya
 Now the problem of supporting the object world was over; The problem was to know it
 20 veen shatabdi ke vyavahaaravaadi darshan ne pratyaksh kaa gyaan kaa uchit madhyam banane main kaaphi yoga diya
 This philosophical trend developed in America
 charles es
 piers ko iskaa sansthaapak mana jaataa he
 But its principal lecturer is William James
 james ne prayog ko satyasty vivak kaa madhya bataaya
 According to them we should see whether the given item fulfills our aspirations or not
 yadi karti he to vah usee prakaar kii vastu he jaisi ham use samajhate hai
 Against the suffragette Advaita, he established a multiplicity of concrete things
 usne kaha, yadi manushya sahit prayek vastu maatr praathmik niraakaar yaa aseem dravya kaa parinaam he, to naitik uttardaayitv, karm sabandhi swatantraaa, vyaktigat prayatnon or aakankshaon kaa arth kya hoga? It is from here that the plurality of the direct world, including humans, was freed from the philosophical speculation of philosophers
 manovigyaan ne pratyaksh kaa adhyayan kar uchit pratyaksh or bhram ke aadhaaron ko alag kiya
 Realistic thinking was pervaded by the influence of psychology
 manushya or jagat kii satta par andeh karne kii koi baat na rah gai or pratyaksh donon ke bich preshniyata kaa madhyam samajha jane laga
 In the 20th century, philosophical epistemology and psychological interpretations led to a compromise between philosophers emphasizing non-objection or undisclosed direct
 manovigyaan ne vyaktitv ke adhyayan se prayek vyakti ko ek swatantra prakaar nishchit kiya
 The French thinker Henri Vergans gave more value to the inner experience than to the mental perception of things
 vyakti kii aparokshanubhuti use anya vyaktiyon se vishisht bana detii he
 This feeling is not in any specific person, but in everyone
 abhipraay yah he ki ek hi sansar main rahete hue, sabake drushtikon bhinn hai, sabhi apane apane dhang ke vyakti hai
 In this way, the present knowledgemaking confers a specific place to each person in the society
 vartmaan astitvvaad isse bhi thodaa aage badhkar vishisht manasthitiyon evam vaasanaon kaa udghaatan karne main pravrutt he
 If we give place to these individual human trades in the business, we certainly accept the existence and value of all individuals equally
 darshanik vyaktvaad kaa yahi aashay he

 After expelling King Susharma and the Kauravas from the battlefield, the Pandavas revealed themselves publicly
 unka asli parichay paakar raja viraat ko atyant prasannataa hui or unhone apni putree uttara kaa vivaah arjuna ke putr abhimanyu ke saath bade hi dhoomdhaam ke saath kar diya
 Along with Shri Krishna and Balarama, many big kings and emperors also attended this marriage
 abhimanyu ke vivaah ke pashchaat pandavon ne apana rajya waapas lautaane ke uddeshy se shrikrishna ko apana doot bana kar hastinapur bheja
 After receiving proper hospitality and posture in Dhritarashtra Raj Sabha, Shri Krishna said, “O Rajan! The Pandavas have sent salutes to all the gurus present here, saying that we have completed twelve years of exile and one year of exile as per the agreement made earlier
 ab aap hamen diye vachan ke anusaar hamaara aadha rajya lautaa dijiye
 After listening to the words of Shri Krishna, the gurus, Bhishma, Vidur, Drona, etc
, and the great sages like Parashuram, Kanva etc
 explained to Dhritarashtra that they should return the Pandavas to their kingdom immediately, walking in the path of religion and justice
 kintu unki is samajhaaish ko sunakar duryodhana ne atyant krodhit hokar kaha, “jyeshtha putr hone ke naate is rajya par mere pita dhritarashtra kaa adhikaar tha kintu unke andhtv kaa laabh uthaa kar chachaa pandu ne rajsinghaasana par adhikaar kar liya
 i am the eldest son of Maharaj Dhritarashtra, so i have only my authority over this state

 If they want their kingdom back, they should fight it and get it
 upasthit samast janon ke baarambaar samajhane ke baad bhi duryodhana apni baat par adig rahaa or shri krishna waapas pandavon ke paas chale aaye or donon pakshon main yuddh kii taiyaari hone lagi
 Due to Duryodhana's insistence on his decision not to give the Pandavas a kingdom, mid-war was decided on both sides and both sides started seeking help for themselves
 ek din duryodhana shri krishna se bhavi yuddh ke liye sahaayta praapt karne hetu dwarikapuri ja pahunchaa
 When he reached at that time, Shri Krishna was engrossed in sleep, so he sat down at his head
 iske kuch hi der pashchaat pandutanay arjuna bhi isi kaary se unke paas pahunche or unhen soya dekhakar unke paitaane baith gayi
 When Shri Krishna's sleep was broken, first his vision fell on Arjuna
 arjuna se kushal kshem poochne ke bhagwaan krishna ne unke aagaman kaa kaaran poocha
 Arjuna said, "lord! i have come to seek your help for the future war
 ” arjuna ke itnaa kehete hi sirahaane bata hua duryodhana bol uthaa, “he krishna! main bhi aapse sahaayta ke liye aayaa hoon
 Since i have come before Arjuna, i have the first right to ask for help
 ” Hearing the words of Duryodhana, Lord Krishna turned around and saw Duryodhana and said, “O Duryodhana! My eyes are on Arjun first and you say that you have come earlier
 atah mujhe tum donon kii hi sahaayta kerani padegi
 i will give my whole army to one of you and i will live with the other myself
 kintu main na to yuddh karunga or na hi shastr dhaaran karunga
 Now you guys decide what you want
 ” Arjuna expressed his desire to keep Shri Krishna with him, which pleased Duryodhana because he had come to take the huge army of Shri Krishna
 is prakaar shri krishna ne bhavi yuddh ke liye duryodhana ko apni sena de di or swayan pandavon ke saath ho gayi
 After Duryodhana left, Krishna asked Arjuna, “O Partha! What did you think of me and asked for me even after i decided not to fight? " Arjuna replied, "lord! i believe that victory is where you are
 or phir meri ichha he ki aap meraa sarathi bane
 Hearing of Arjuna, Lord Krishna accepted him to be his charioteer
