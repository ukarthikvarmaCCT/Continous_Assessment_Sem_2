 Friedrich Engels'
 us samay barmen ek teji se viksit hota audyogic nagar tha
 Engels' father Frederick Sr
 was a wealthy cotton businessman
 angels ke pita kii protestant isai dharm main gahari aasthaa thi or angels kaa laalan paalan bhi behad dharmik maahaul main hua
 Due to Engels's atheist and revolutionary views, there was a growing rift between him and the family
 angels kii maa dwaara elizabeth dwaara unhe 1848 main likhe ek khat se is baat kii pushti ho jaati he
 Elizabeth wrote to him that he had gone far ahead in his activities and that he should not go that far and return to the family
 unhone khat main likhaa tha "tum hamase itani dur chale gayi ho bete ki tumhen ajanabiyon ke dukh takalif kii adhik chintaa he or maa ke asunon kii jaraa bhi phikr nahin
 God only knows what is going on me
 jab maine aaj akhbaar main tumhaara giraftaar warrant dekha to mere haath kaanpane lage
 "this letter to Engels was written while he was underground in Brussels, Belgium
 isse pehle jab angels mahaj 18 varsh ke the to unhen parivaar kii icchaanusaar hiskool kii padhai bich main hi chhod deni paddy thi
 After this, his family arranged for him the job of unpaid clerk in an office in Bremen
 angels ke parijanon kaa sochna tha ki iske jariye angels vyavhaarik banenge or apane pita kii tarah vyapaar main khub naam kamaayenge
 However his family was deeply disappointed by Engels' revolutionary activities
 bramen pravaas ke dauraan angels ne german darshanik higel ke darshan kaa adhyayan kiya
 Hegel was the source of inspiration for many young revolutionaries of those days
 angels ne is dauraan hi sahitya or patrakarita ke kshetra main sakriyata dikhaani shuru kar di thi
 He wrote his first poem in September of 1838 called 'the Bedouin'
 angels 1841 main prashia kii sena main shaamil ho gayi or is tarah se berlin ja pahunche
 In Berlin, he got a chance to study in universities and during this time he joined a group of Hegelist youth
 unhone apni pahchaan gupt rakhte huye kaarkaanon main kaam karne vaale mazdooron kii vaastavik sthityon par rhinish jetung naamak samachaarpatr main bhi kai lekh likhe
 At that time the editor of this newspaper was Karl Marx
 marks or angels kaa isse pehle koi parichay nahin tha or november 1842 main hui ek choti si mulaakaat ke baad hi donon ko ek duusare ko jaanane kaa mauka mila
 Engels remained grateful to German philosophy throughout his life because he believed that it was only because of this environment that his intellectual development was possible
 angels ke parijanon ne unhen 1842 main 22 varsh kii umr main england ke manchester bhej diya
 Here he was sent to work in the Victoria mill of Erman and Engels, which used to make cloth chest threads
 angels ke pita kaa khyaal tha ki manchester main kaam ke dauraan vah apane jivan par purnvichaar karenge
 While on his way to England, Engels went to the office of Rhenish Jetung where he met Marx for the first time
 is mulaakaat ke dauraan marks ne angels ko adhik gambhirtha se nahin liya kyonki marks kaa maananaa thi ki angels abhi bhi higelvaadiyon se prabhavit hai, jabaki marks us samay tak higelvaadiyon se alag ho chuke the
 During his stay in Manchester, Engels met Mary Burns, a working woman with revolutionary ideas, and was with them until Burns died in 1862
 in donon ne kabhi bhi vivaah ke paaramparik bandhan main apane rishte ko nahin baandha kyonki dono hi vivaah kahalaane vaali saamaajik sanstha ke khilaaf the
 Engels was a strong advocate of living with the same spouse, but he believed that since marriage is a system imposed by the state and the church, it is a kind of class exploitation
 burns ne angels ko manchester or selford ke behad badahaal ilaakon kaa daura bhi karaayaa
 During his stay in Manchester, Engels wrote his first economic work Outline of a Critique of Political Economy
 angels ne is lekh ko oktober se november 1843 ke bich likhaa tha jise baad main unhone paris main rah rahe marks ko bhej diya
 Marx published these in the Deutsche Fran√ßois Jaarbacher
 angels ne condishan of england naamak teen hisson vaali ek shrinkhalaa bhi janvari se march 1844 ke bich likhi
 The poor condition of Manchester's slums made Engels the subject matter of his articles
 unhone behad kharaab maahaul main bal majuri karte bacchon par lekh likhe or marks ko lekhon kii ek nai shrinkhalaa bhej di1 in lekhon ko pehle rhinish jetung or phir doue francoische jarbakher main prakaashik kiya gaya
 These writings were later given the shape of a book which was published in 1845 under The Condition of Working Class in England
 is pustak kaa angeji sanskaran 1887 main prakaashik hua
 Engels not only revealed his thoughts on the shaky future of capitalism and the industrial revolution in this book, besides presenting a recent statement of the real state of the toiling masses of England
 britain main kuch varsh bitaane ke baad angels ne 1844 main germany lautne kaa nishchay kiya
 On his way back, he went to Paris to meet Marx
 prashia sarkaar dwaara rinish jetung ko march 1843 main pratibandhit kiye jane ke baad marks paris palaayan kar gayi the or oktober 1843 se vahaan rah rahe the
 While in Paris, Marx was publishing Douche Francisouche Zarbakher
 marks or angels ke bich 28 agast 1844 ko place du pellis par sthit cafe de laa regence main mulaakaat hui or dono gahare dost ban gayi
 This friendship of Marx and Engels continued
 angels ne paris pravaas ke dauraan pavitra parivaar holi family likhane main marks kii madad kii
 The book was published in February 1845 and attacked the young Hegelists and the Baur brothers
 angels 06 sitambar 1844 ko germany ke barmen sthit apane ghar laut gayi
 During this time he worked on the English edition of his book "the Condition of the English Working Class" which was published in May 1845
 france sarkaar ne 03 farvari 1845 ko marks ko deshnikala de diya tha jiske baad vah apni patni or putree sahit belgium ke brussels main jaakar bas gayi
 Engels moved to Brussels in April 1845 with the intention of helping Marx write a book called German Idology
 isse pehle pustak prakaashan ke liye dhan ikattha karne ke liye angels ne rinland ke vamapanthiyon se sampark kaayam kiya tha
 Marx and Engels lived in Brussels from 1845 to 1848
 is dauraan unhone yahaan ke mazdooron ko sangathit karne kaa kaam kiya
 Shortly after coming to Brussels, the two underground organizations became members of the German Communist League
 communist lig krantikariyon kaa ek antarrashtriya sanghathan thi jisaki shakhaaen kai europea shaharon main faili thim
 Many friends of Marx and Engels also joined this organization
 communist lig ne marks or angels ko communist party ke aadarshon par ek pamfalet likhane kaa kaam saunpa jise aage jaakar communist ghoshnaptr ke naam se janaa gaya
 It was published on 21 February 1848 and the few lines that were immortalized forever in history, a communist revolution would shake the foundations of the ruling classes
 sarvhaara varg ke paas zanjeeron ko khone ke alaava kuch bhi nahin he
 The whole world is lying in front of him to win
 duniyabar ke mehnakatakashon ek ho
 There was a revolution in France in 1848 which soon engulfed other West European countries
 isaki vajah se angels or marks ko apane desh prashia lautne par majaboor hona pada
 They both settled in a city called Kalon
 calon main rahete huye dono mitron ne milakar newe rhinish jetung naamak akhbaar shuru kiya
 After the coup in Prussia in June 1849, this newspaper had to face the repression of the regime
 is takhtapalat ke baad marks se unki prashia kii naagarikta chin lee gayi or unhe deshnikala de diya gaya
 After this, Marx went to Paris and from there to London
 angels prashia main hi tike rahe or unhone communist sainya adhikari august vilich kii tukadiyon main ek aid de camp kii bhoomika adaa kii
 These troops carried out an armed struggle in South Germany
 jab is andolan ko kuchal diya gaya to angels bache khuche krantikariyon ke saath seemaa paar karke switsraland chale gayi
 Engels entered Switzerland as a refugee and escaped to safe England
 is bich marks ko lagaatar angels kii phikr sataati rahi thi
 After his arrival in England, Engels decided to work in the same old company owned by his father, with the intention of financially helping write Marx's slave capital
 angels ko yah kaam pasand nahin tha par ek mahaan uddheshy ko safal banane ke iraade se vah is kaarkaane main kaam karte rahe
 The British intelligence police were constantly monitoring Engels and he was hiding here with different names with Mary Burns
 1 Engels wrote a book called The Patent War in Germany while working in the mill
 is dauraan vah samachaarpatron main bhi nirantar aalekh likhte rahe the
 Engels also started working as an office clerk during this period and became a partner in this mill in 1864
 haalanki paanch varshon ke baad adhyayan main adhik samay dene ke iraade se unhone is kaarobaar ko alavida kah diya
 In this correspondence between Marx and Engels, the two friends also discussed in detail the possible bourgeois revolution in Russia
 angels 1870 main england aa gayi or apane antim dinon tak yaheen rahe
 He lived at 122 Regent Park Road on Primrose Hill

 After Marx's death, Engels worked to complete the unfinished blocks of the slave capital
 angels ne is dauraan parivaar 
 nijee sampatti or rajya kii utpatti jaisi vilakshan pustak ko likhane kaa bhi kaam kiya
 In this book, he tried to explain that there have been many changes in history in the family structure
 angels ne bataaya ki ek patni pratha kaa udai darasal purush kii apane bacchon ke haathon main hi sampatti saunpane kii ichha se mahila ko gulam banane kii aavashyaktaa ke saath hua

 Adalat 2 is an Indian Hindi serial that airs on Sony from 4 June 2016 on Saturdays and Sundays at 8 pm
 yah adaalat naamak dharawahik kaa doosraa satr he
 Panchjanya is a weekly Hindi newspaper promoting the Indian nationalist ideology
 yah rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii vichaardhaara kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Immediately after the attainment of independence, on 14 January 1948, on the occasion of the holy festival of Makar Sankranti, the incarnation of 'panchjanya' weekly in the editorship of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee with the conclave from the face of Lord Shri Krishna on his cover page, inspiring ideals and national of freedom movement in independent India It was the announcement of the resolve to remind the targets
 swatantryottar hindi patrakarita ke liye yah kam gaurav kii baat nahin he ki kisi vyaktigat swaamitv athwa audyogic gharaane kii chhatrachhaaya se baahar rahakar bhi ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò saptahik apni swarna jayanti manaa chukaa he or us swarna jayanti varsh main uske pratham sampadak bharat ke pradhanmantri pad par asin hue
 Is it not surprising that when the prestigious and resourceful weekly like 'dharmayuga', 'dinman', 'weekly Hindustan', 'sunday' have become timeless, in such a situation, 'panchjanya' without means, not only keep his life journey intact Could not but today stand first in line among the weeklies with the highest circulation
 ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kii safalataa kaa ekmaatr rahasy yahi ho saktaa he ki uskaa janm munafkhor, vyavsaayikta ke bajaay samajanishth dhyeywaadee patrakarita main se janm hua he
 The journey of missionary journalism could never be easier and easier
 isliye ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kii yatra swatantryotar dhyey samarpit or adarshavaadi patrakarita ke sangharsh kii yashogaatha he
 Rajiv Lochan Agnihotri, Gyanendra Saxena, Girish Chandra Mishra, Mahendra Kulshrestha, Tilak Singh Parmar, Yadav Rao Deshmukh, Vachnesh Tripathi, Kewal Ratan Malkani, Devendra Swarup, Deenath Swarup Names like Mishra, Bhanupratap Shukla, Ramshankar Agnihotri, Prabal Maitra, Tarun Vijay come up
 naam badale honge par ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kii nishtha or swar main kabhi koi parivartan nahin aayaa
 They remained motionless
 kintu ek aisa naam he jo is suchi main kahin nahin he
 But he can be said to be the source of inspiration for every name in this list, who never got his name printed as an editor, but from whose imagination 'panchjanya' was born, the name is Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya
 vastut: jis rashtradharm prakaashan ke tatwadhan main lakhanu se ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kaa prakaashan prarambh hua uskaa bijaropan pan0 dinadayal upaadhyaay kii pahal par ho chukaa tha, jinhone ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke shishav kaal main sampadak se lekar pruf reader, compojitor, mudrak or kabhi-kabhi bandal baandhne, unhen le jane ke sab dayitvon kaa nirvaah karte hue ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kaa paalan poshan kiya
 He did not give his name to the editorial post of 'panchajanya' but he was the true 'panchajanya' father and father
 ve mahaan moulik chintak or kalam ke dhani the
 But he did not become an editor himself, instead he created editors
 1968 main apni asamyik mrityu tak ve ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke vaastavik maardarshak the
 He was the editor's guru, not the editor
 1968 tak ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke vaastavik maardarshak the
 He was the editor's guru, not the editor
 1968 tak ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò main unhone bahut likhaa
 Wrote by many names
 unhone swatantryotar patrakarita main prasiddhi paranmukh, dhyey samarpit patrakarita kaa ek dularbh udhaaharan prastut kiya
 His holy memory is the path of the difficult mission of 'panchajanya'
 ek prakaar se ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò unke chintan tantra kaa akhand pravaah he, unki paavan smriti kaa akshay kendra he
 Being dependent on the spirit of fame-oriented meditational personality like Pandit Deendayal ji, 'panchjanya' continued to grow on his goal path even after being devoid of resources, despite many adverse flows coming from power
 uske janm kaa ek maah bhi puraa nahin hua tha ki gandhi hatya seprakshabhith vaataavaran kaa laabh uthaakar sarkaar ne farvari, 1948 main ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kaa galaa ghontne kii koshish kii
 Locked his editor, publisher and printer in jail, locking his office
 saadhe chaar maah baad nyaayalay kii krupa se ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kaa pun: prakaashan sambhav ho paaya
 After six months, 'panchjanya' was again attacked in December 1948 and was locked in his mouth for seven months
 july, 1949 main yah taala hatate hi ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kaa shankhanaad purvawat gunj uthaa
 The fearless voice of 'panchajanya' in the national interest has always been a headache for governments
 1959 main communist china dwaara tibet kii swadhinata ke apharan or dalai lamas ke nishkasana ke samay ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ne nehru ji kii adoordarshita or china kii niti kii nirbhay hokar aalochana kii
 The 'panchjanya' blamed Nehru ji's failed foreign policy and defense policy for China's attack on India in 1962, which led to the Nehru government's threatening notice to the 'panchjanya' with the mole
 1972 main bhartiya senaaon kii vijay ko shimla samjhaute kii mej par ganvaa dene ke viruddh ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke aakrosh se tilamilaakar indira sarkaar ne ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke sampadakon evam prakashkon ko lambe samay tak kanoonee kaarywahi main fansaae rakhaa
 In June 1975, Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency and tried to strangle Indian democracy and in March 1977, only 'panchjanya' could resume her mission
 ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke nirbhik swar se tilamilaakar logon evam sarkaar dwaara daayar kiye gaye mukademon kii suchi bahut lambi he
 The editors and publishers of 'panchajanya' have always had a foot in the court
 ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò kii yatra sadhano ke abhaav evam sarkari prakopon ke viruddh rashtriya chetana kii jijeevishaa or sangharsh kii preranadai gaatha he
 It is clear from the motto sentences such as 'the sentinels of nationality', 'the harbinger of cultural chena' or 'the voice of national self-respect and valor' as declared from time to time by 'pachjanya', 'pachjanya' refers to the journey of independent India on the path of national reconstruction The fear of warning the tendencies and powers that threaten to keep them connected to the original motivations of the freedom movement has been repeatedly Am Njata
 samay-samay par prarambh kiye gaye stambhon se spasht hota he ki raashtra jivan kaa koi bhi kshetra yaa pahalu uski drushti se ojhal nahin rahaa
 Be it international events or national events cycle, world, education world, women's world, youth world, nation's thinking, current affairs, history's window, movie review, literature review, culture-truth, etc
 Is a symbol of ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke lekhak varg main dow sampoornanand, rajarshi purushottam das tandon, dow raamamanohar lohia, acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi, amritlal nagar, mahadevi verma, kishori das vaajapeyi, krishnachand prakaash medhe jaise murdhanya vichaarkon rajanetaaon tathaa sahityakaron kaa yogadan rahaa hai
 Apart from these, 'panchajanya' has made a meaningful attempt to run a debate on national problems by publishing interviews of top leaders of various political parties
 aise netaaon main morarji desai, choudhary charan singh, chandrasekhar, mulaayam singh yadav, sharad pavaar, sharad yadav, e0 bi0 vardhan, em0 farukhi, moulana vahidudin khan aadi ke naam ginaae ja sakate he
 At this time, thinkers like Jagmohan, Arun Shourie and JN Dixit are regular authors of 'panchjanya'
 ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ne jahaan apane saamaanya ank ke simit kalevar main anek stambhon ke madhyam se apni saanskrithik drushti ke alok main pathakon ko desh-videsh ke ghatnachakra se avgat karaane kii koshish kii, to vichaar pradhan lekhon ke dwaara moolgami rashtriya prashnon par bhi unhen sochane kii saamagree pradaan kii
 Assam and Northeast India are going through the crisis today, why Kashmir problem remains the destiny of our life? 'panchjanya' has been warning about it since its birth
 ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ke puraane ankon kaa adhyayan karne par spasht hoga ki yadi samay rahete ‚Äòpachajanya‚Äò kii chetavaniyon ko suna gaya hota to pruthakatawaad, paanchajnya vighatan evam rajnatik dalon ke jis sankat se ham guzar rahe hai, vah hamaare saamne na aata
 'panchjanya' is playing the role of a guardian of nationalism at every important point of the journey of independent India
 ‚Äòpaanchajnya‚Äò ne varsh main kam se kam paanch avasaron par visheshank nikaalane kaa nishchay kiya
 Independence Day '15 August', Republic Day '26 January', Vijaya Dashami, Deepawali, Varsha Pratipada
 inke atirikt bhi aavashyaktaanusaar, vishayanusaar, visheshankon kaa aayojan kiya jaataa rahaa
 Each issue contains a compilation of thoughtful articles on history, culture and politics
 vishay kendrit visheshankon kii parampara swayan main bahut samrudh or anuthi he
 From the very beginning, 'panchajanya' organized a booklet of three specialties on 'politics', 'earth' and 'society' under the system trilogy
 tilak singh parmaar ke sampaadan kaal main ‚Äòsamaaj ank‚Äò, ‚Äòrashtriya ekta ank‚Äò, ‚Äòkerala ank‚Äò, ‚Äòtibet ank‚Äò or ‚Äòjansangh ank‚Äò nikle
 Yadavrao Deshmukh organized 'save Himalaya Points', 'war Points', 'kashmir Points', 'indo-nepal Friendship Points'
 vachanesh treepathi ne swadhinata ke liye hue kranti sangharsh par do ‚Äòkranti sansmaran ank‚Äò yojit kiye
 Devendra Swarup, the chief editor of only Ratan Malkani, organized the 'indianisation specials', 'gandhi Janma Shatabdi special', 'bengal special', 'bangladesh Mukti special', 'daridranarayan special'
 bhanu pratap shukla ne ‚Äòkranti katha ank‚Äò, ‚Äòvir vanavaasi ank‚Äò, ‚Äòudyog ank‚Äò aadi nikaale

 The ancient Romans and Greeks had knowledge of these events and have given a very interesting and detailed description of these scenes
 dakshin golardhwaalon ne kumeru jyoti kaa kuch spasht kaarnon se vaisaa vyapak or rochak varnan nahin kiya he, jaisaa uttari golardhavalon ne sumeru jyoti kaa kiya he

 Jyoti, which does not display ray structure - contains samang chap, samang patta and vibrating pages
 vegord ne jyoti ko shant or chal roopon main vargeekrut kiya he

 The actual direction depends on the location
 yah mahatv kii baat he ki kirandhara ke vikiranvindu kaa chumbakeey shirovindu se sampatan hota he
 Daily and seasonal changes are seen in myeloid activity
 aadhi raat ke thik pehle spasht dainik pramukh ucchtam or praat: durbal ucchtam sakriyata hoti he
 The annual frequency of lower latitudes has the two highest activations that coincide with the equinoxes
 jyon-jyon ham merujyotiya kshetra kii ore badhate hai ye ucchtam sakriyataayen ek duusare ke nikat aati jaati hai or ucchtam sakriyata madhya jaade main hoti he
 Mystic activity follows the 11-year-old and known activity, and when large clusters of sun spots pass near the central meridian of the Sun, this phenomenon has a tendency to occur at the same time
 chumbakeey vikshobh ke samaan hi 27 dinon baad pun: merujyotiya sakriyata kii pravriti dekhi jaati he
 The diagram, made by Currie and Edward, is given above, which shows the equivalence of spinal, magnetic and geomorphic activations

 The snorkeler expels the water from the snorkel, either by a sharp sigh when it comes to the surface, or by tilting the rear of the head just before reaching the surface, pushing the water before coming to the surface or "breaking" it and drawing the next breath
 The first moves forward

 In some modern snorkels, sump is used to retain a small amount of water in the mouth and the water does not enter when the snorkeler breathes
 Some snorkels have a one-way valve inside the sump, which automatically empties the sump in case of waterlogging

 In such a situation, the lungs do not spread when the snorkeler breathes because the muscles that stretch the lungs do not have the strength to work against the high pressure of deep water
 The snorkel generates "dead airspace", when the user breathes freshly, then the previously removed exhaled breath remains in the snorkel which then re-enters the lungs, reducing the ability to breathe, which is why hypercapnia In which carbon dioxide starts to form in the blood
 snorkel main jitani adhik hawa kii maatra rahati he samasya utani hi badhati jaati he
 Modern snorkeling technology helps reduce CO2 weakening
 mark aar
 johnson MD ne "cadens takanic" vaale aise snorkel kaa avishkaar kiya jo hawa ke sidhe pravaah ke liye ek tarfaa valve kaa prayog karke or uchhavas ke raaston ko alag karata he
 The exhalation valve exerts a resistance in the path of exhalation in the snorkel that produces a slight back pressure, which leads to normal breathing and increases the volume of the lungs

 However these devices prevent and protect the snorkeler from free diving at any depth
 khaastaur par thande pani main paryaapt motaai or aakaar kaa wet suut pahananaa chahie, yah wet suut doobane ke khilaaf kuch utplavan pradaan karata he
 Snorkelers in tropical regions often wear a rashguard or shirt and / or wide paired shorts to protect their thighs and back skin from sunburn
 anbhavi snorcolor praayah apni shaukia mukt gotakhori ko parakhnaa shuru karte hai, yah kisi gotakhori ke nirdeshak yaa anbhavi mukt gotaakhor ke prashikshan ke baad hi sambhav ho paata he

 avastai ek purvi irani bhashaa he jiskaa gyaan aadhunik yug main keval parsi dharm ke granthon, yani avastaa, ke dwaara pahunch paaya he
 Historians believe that this language or its dialects were spoken in the period of 1500‚Äì1100 BCE in the Yaz culture located in the Bactria and Margu regions of Central Asia
 kyonki yah ek dharmik bhashaa ban gai, isliye is bhashaa ke saadhaaran jivan se lupt hone ke pashchaat bhi iskaa prayog nae granthon ko likhane ke liye hota rahaa
 Written compositions of only two Iranian languages of the era 1500 BC have been found
 ek "pracheen avastai" he jo uttarpurv main boli jaati thi or ek "pracheen farsi" he jo dakshin-pashchim main boli jaati thi
 Among Iranian languages, it is a major division of Eastern Iranian languages and Western Iranian languages
 armbh main keval ek "aadim hind-irani bhashaa" thi - isi se hind-irani bhashaa parivaar kii sabhi bhashaayen janmi hai, jinamein sanskrit, hindi, kashmiri, farsi, pashto sabhi shaamil hai
 Ancient Avastai is the language of the era when Eastern Iranian languages and Vedic Sanskrit were very similar
 pashchimi irani bhashaaon main kuch badlaav aa rahe the jis se vah vaidic sanskrit se thodi bhinn ho chuki thi
 It can be said that the ancient avastai was between these two - it is very similar to Vedic Sanskrit and it is also similar to ancient Persian
 avastai bhashaa main rachanaayen kam hai isliye avastai shabd-vyakaran samajhane ke liye bhashavaigyanik vaidic sanskrit kaa pehle adhyayan kar uski sahaayta lete hai kyonki avastai or vaidic sanskrit main is kshetra main nikat kaa sambandh he
 In the 19th century, Western scholars had a new look at both Avastai and Vedic Sanskrit, and the fact of their deep relationship was soon revealed to them
 unhone dekha ke avastai farsi or vaidic sanskrit ke shabdon main kuch saral niyamon ke saath ek se dusre ko anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa tha or vyakaran kii drushti se yah donon bahut nazadik the
 In his book "comparison of Avastai Grammar with Sanskrit and the Avastai alphabet and its transliteration" published in 1892, the linguist and scholar Abraham Jackson, for example, directly translated an Avatai's religious verse into Vedic Sanskrit - avastai kii apni "pahalavi" lipi thi or uskaa istemaal ab parsi dharmik prayogon ko chhodkar lupt ho chukaa he
 It is written from right to left like Persian and ancient Indian script Kharoshthi
 isamen 13 mul akshar the jinke avastai main 53 bhinn rup prayog hote the
 These characters were based on the Aramai script, from which all modern scripts of India have also originated

 No scripture with this type of name is famous in ancient Indian philosophy
 bhartiya darshan main tarkshastra kaa janm swatantra shaastra ke rup main nahin hua
 Akshpad! Gautama or Gautama's Nyasutra is the first treatise in which the problems of so-called logic are systematically considered
 ukt sutron kaa ek bada bhaag in samasyaon par vichaar karata he, phir bhi ukt granth main yah vishay darshanapaddati ke ang ke rup main nirupit hua he
 Sixteen test materials are mentioned in the judiciary
 inamen sarvapratham pramaan naam kaa vishay yaa padaarth he
 In fact, in Indian philosophy, today's logic can be replaced by 'evidence'
 kintu pramanshastra kii vishaywastu tarkshastra kii apeksha adhik vistrut he
 The Greek philosopher Aristotle is believed to have been the originator and founder of logic in Europe, as before there had been some thinking on certain logistical problems by metaphysical teachers, Socrates and Aflatoon or Plato
 yah dilachasp baat he ki swayan arestu, jisane vichaaron ke itihaas main pehali baar gyaan kaa vibhinn shakhaon main vibhaajan kiya, 'tarkshastra' naam se parichit nahin he
 He has named his objective thinking as 'analytics'
 tarkshastra ke vaachak shabd 'lajika' kaa sarvapratham prayog roman lekhak siciro main miltaa he, yadhyapi vahaan uskaa arth kuch bhinn he
 According to Aristotle, the subject of logic is contemplation, not the bearer of thought
 uske tarkshastreey granthon main mukhyatah nimna vishyon kaa pratipaadan hua he : The sentence is made up of terms
 prayek pad kuch vastuon kaa sanket karata he or kuch gunon yaa visheshtaon kaa bodhak bhi hota he
 The characteristic of the object symbol is called the 'denotation' of the term, the indicated nature of the illuminative properties is called 'connotation' in the macro form, just as the denotation of the term 'man' is 'all humans', its connotation is 'life' and 'enlightenment'
 prayek vaakya main ek uddeshy pad hota he, ek vidhey pad or unhen jodanevaala sanyojak
 The predicate terms are of several categories, some describing the purpose, some describing its external characteristics
 vidhey padon ke vargeekaran kaa arestu ke paribhaasha sambandhi vichaaron se ghanaa sambandh he
 Classification of sentences or statements are also many; That is, according to quality, quantity, relation and determinism
 sambandh ke anusaar vaakya categorical ; hetuhetumd ; or dispanctive hote hai
 According to certainty, there are three types of narrative, probabilistic and deterministic
 vaakya kaa pramukh rup 'categarical' he
 By the way, sentences are classified according to quality and magnitude
 gun or pariman ke sammilit prakaaron ke anuroop vargeekaran dwaara chaar tarah ke vaakya uplabdh hote hai, jinhe roman aksharon - e, i, ai, o dwaara sanketit kiya jaataa he
 The nouns a and e are the positive servative legislative and negation sentences, such as 'all man is perfect' and 'no man is perfect'; Some related legislative and prohibitive sentences are called i and o respectively; For example - 'some humans are educated' and 'some humans are not educated'
 ' The main prophetic theme of Aristotle's logic is the inference expressed in the judgments; There are 19 types of correct estimates which are published in four types of components
 chaar prakaar ke nyaay vaakya avyavsanhatiyaan 'figures' kehalaati hai or unamem paae janevaale sahi anumaanroop 'mood' kahe jate hai
 These 'moods' can be changed from second 'figures' to forms of first 'figure'
 pratham 'figure' sabase purna 'figure' maani jaati he
 In Indian philosophy, as stated above, the thing that has developed is the philosophy; The so-called logic is only a part of it
 gautam ke 'nyayasutra' main prama yaa yatharth gyaan ke utpaadak vishisht yaa pradhan kaaran 'pramaan' kehalaate hai; unki sankhya chaar he, arthath pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd
 According to the Bhat Mimansakas and Vedantis, the evidence is six, that is, the appropriate four and the economy and unavailability
 bhartiya gyaan mimasaa main ukt pramaanon ko lekar bahut chintan or vivaad hua he
 The analysis of the Darsha done by Buddhists, Naiyayikas, Vedantis etc
 is particularly influenced by their respective metaphysical views
 nyaay ke anusaar anumaan do prakaar kaa hota he, pararthanumaan tathaa swaarthanumaan
 The prescriptive judgment of inference consists of five sentences called pledge, for, example, subrogation and incorporation, respectively
 vedantiyon ke anusaar in paanchon main se shuru yaa baad ke teen vaakya anumaan ke liye paryaapt he
 In the opinion of Buddhist logician Dharmakirti, there is a reason for guessing, ie, gender or having three characteristics
 ye teen visheshtaayen hai- anumey yaa paksh main nishchit upasthiti; sapaksh main hi upasthiti ; or asapaksh yaa vipaksh main nishchit anupasthiti 
 Here is the mountain side, where fire is estimated by the presence of dhoom; The kitchen is spacious, where the presence of dhoom is known with uncertain presence, where the absence of dhoom with fire is certain
 aage ham 'tarkshastra' shabd kaa prayog uske sankeern, aadhunik arth main karenge
 What would be the definition of logic within the scope of this meaning? In John Stuart Mill's opinion, the subject of logic is permissions, not empirical truth
 tarkshastra vishwaason kaa vigyaan nahin he, vah upapatti athwa sakshya kaa vigyaan nahin he
 The field of logic is that part of our knowledge, whose form is 'allowed by pre-known truths'
 tarkshastra kaa kaary kisi satya kaa sakshya jutanaa nahin he, vah yah aankane kaa praytn he ki kisi anumiti ke liye uchit sakshya prastut kiya gaya he yaa nahin
 In short, the work of logic is an exploration of the basis of correct permission
 tarkshastra kaa gyaan hamamen yah dekhne or aankane kii kshamta utpann karata he ki kisi satya kaa sakshya jutanaa nahin he, vah yah aankane kaa praytn he ki kisi anumiti ke nishchayatmak aadhaaron kaa gyaapan hi he, arthath uskaa vishay nishchayatmak anumitiyon or aadharbhoot sakshya ke sambandhon ko spasht karnaa athwa un niyamon ko prakaash main laana he jo sahi anumaan prakriya ko niyantrit karte hai
 So it is sometimes said that logic is a regulatory science or science whose function is to stabilize ideal forms of permissiveness or logic
 iske vipareet bhautikee yaa bhautikashastra, arthshaastra, samajashaastra aadi yatharthanveshi vigyaan he, jo vastusatta ke yatharth yaa vaastavik roopon yaa niyamon kaa anveshan karte hai
 This classification of sciences is somewhat misleading
 tarkshastra yaa achaarshastra niamak shaastra he, is kathan kaa yah arth lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ukt shaastra kritrim dhang se kshetravishesh main maanav vyavhaar ke niyamon kaa nirdesh karte hai maano sahi chintan evam sahi naitik vyavhaar ke niyam maanav prakruti ke nijee niyam na hokar usapar baahar se laade janevaale niyam hai
 But this is not the case
 vastutah tarkshastra un niyamon ko, jo sahi chintan prakaaron main swatah, swabhaavatah otprot samajhe jate hai, prakat rup main nirdeshit karne kaa upkaran maatr he
 Thoughtful humans automatically distinguish between innocent and innocent arguments - types of thinking, right and wrong
 kintu is prakaar kaa antar karte hue ve kinhin niamak aadarshon yaa kanoonon kii avgati yaa chetana kaa parichay nahin dete
 It is the work of logic to analyze the types of reasoning considered to be right and bring the rules in them to the level of conscious information
 isi prakaar achaarshastra bhi hamen un niyamon yaa aadarsho kii jaankaree detaa he, jo hamaare bhale bure ke nirnyon main, anjaane rup main, parivyapt rahete hai
 That is why it is said that the specific ethics, or ethics and moral education of a society, illuminates the moral biases of that society
 isi arth main deshavishesh, kalvishesh athwa samajavishesh ke naitik vichaarak apane desh, yug athwa samaaj ke pratinidhi chintak hote hai
 The above belief in relation to logic leads to an important conclusion
 yadi kinhin kaarnon se manushya kii chintanapranali athwa tarkpranali main parivartan yaa vikaas ho, to uske anuroop tarkshastreey mantavyon main bhi parivartan yaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 It also happens in the history of logic that in the long run it becomes necessary to amend the old norms or rules of thinking; Along with the creation of new thinking types, the representation of new logical rules can also be expected
 europe main jab bhautik vigyaan kii pragati shuru hui, to vahaan kramshah arestu kii nigamanpranali kii aalochana or usase bhinn aagmanpranali kii pariklpana or prashansa bhi hone lagi
 Lord Bacon did this work in European ideological history
 baad main, vaigyanik anveshan pranali kaa adhik vishleshan ho chukne par, europe ke tarkshastriyon ne nigamanmoolak vichaarpaddati evam pariklpana nigamanpranali jaisi avadharanaon kaa vikaas kiya
 Inductive logics consider rules that make it possible to make or represent general statements based on observed events or trades
 saamaanya kathan praayah vyaptivakyon kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 There has been considerable scrutiny in Indian scripture about the question of how coverage is achieved
 'jahaan-jahaan dhooma hota he, vahaan agni hoti he' - yah vyaptivakya he
 Apparently our observation shows only a few examples of the association of Dhoom and Agni
 prashn he, kuch sthitiyon main nirikshit do chizon ke saahchary se ham unke sarvadeshik or saarvkalik saahchary kii kalpana ke auchity ko kaise siddh kar sakate he? is samasya ko tarkshastra main aagamanaatmak pluti kii samasya kehete hai
 The hypothesis incorporation system presents a solution to the question of normative statements or general concepts without getting confused
 sankshep main aadhunik vaigyanik anveshan kii pranali yah he : Above we emphasized that with the development of new logic systems, there is also a change in the form of logical principles
 is drushti se tarkshastra ek gatisheel vidya he; vah sthir, shaashvat niyamon kaa sankalan yaa ullekh maatr nahin hai
 In fact, the development of various physical, biological and sociological scientists has influenced logic
 anumaan or tarkna kii pranaaliyon tathaa niyamon se adhik aaj vibhinn vidyaon kii anveshna prakriya anushilan kaa vishisht vishay ban gai he
 The classical investigation of the above process is called ritualism
 yahan ek zyada mahatv kaa spashtikaran apekshit he
 Our reasoning process is not of the same order in different areas of experience and thinking
 vigyaan or ganit main tarkna ke tareeke ek prakaar ke hai
 These methods also vary greatly in the field of literature review or ethical decisions
 duusare shabdon main ham kah sakate he ki kala samiksha, sahitya mimasaa, nitishastra aadi ke kshetro main pareekshakon ke swamtasthaapan evam paramatkhandan kii pranaliyaan ek hi si nahin hotin
 They can also vary greatly
 is sthiti ko nimnaankit shabdon main bhi prakat kiya jaataa he: In the twentieth century, there is a development of symbolic or symbolic logic different from the traditional Aristotle logic
 kuch pareekshakon kii drushti main yah ek badi ghatana he
 This new logic is also called mathematical logic
 unnisvin sadi ke madhya main do angrej ganitajnon ne tarkshastra ke is naye rup kaa aadhaar khadaa kiya; ye do ganitagya the - augustus di margan tathaa george bul
 His main exploration was that the permissions mentioned in Aristotle's logic have far more authentic permissions
 arestu ke nyaay-vaakya main prakat kii jane anumitiyon kaa aadhaar siddhant vargsmavesh kaa niyam hai
 By the way, the famous example of conjecture is: all human beings are mortal; Socrates is a human here; So Socrates is deathly here, deathliness is the widespread religion of the class called Man; It is also the religion of Socrates incorporated into that class
 margan or bul ne yah pataa chalaaya ki anumiti kaa asli aadhaar vishesh koti ke sambandh hote he, varg samavesh kaa niyam in kai sambandhken main se ek ke antarbhoot he
 Therefore, that rule should not be considered an independent principle of permissibility
 duusare, aisi anek anumitiyaan hoti hai, jo nyayavakya ke rup main prakat nahin kii ja sakati
 Example: 'the state of a is more than b and the state of b is more than C, hence the state of a is more than C
 ' prasiddh darshanik eff0 ech0 breadle ne bhi aisi anumitiyon kaa sanket kiya he, jo arestu ke nyaayavakya main niveshit nahin ho saktin
 It has been said above that according to the new thinkers the basis of permissiveness is some relationship between the sentences
 swayan 'sambandh' kii avadharana ko paribhaashit karnaa kathin he
 Relationships are classified in many ways
 kuch sambandh do padon yaa padaartho me bich hote hai, kuch teen ke, ityadi
 a substance is related if it is necessary to mention another substance while making some statement about it
 'ram sita kaa pati he', 'raja ne apane shatru ko jehar de diya', 'devdatt ne vishnudutt se das hajaar rupye lekar makaan kharid liya;' - ye vaakya kramshah dwimulak, trimulak evam chaturmulak sambandhon ko prakat karte hai
 According to another classification, there are three types of relationships, even, odd, and non-odd
 jo sambandh karte he; yatha - ram shyaam kaa bhai he; devdatt vishnudutt kaa hamaumr he yaa sahpaathee he; ityadi
 Odd relationship Ram is the husband of Sita
 a-sam visham- devdatt vishnudutt ko pyaar karata he
 One type of relationship is called a spurious relationship; Different than that 'avasthaa main bada hona' ye sab utplavi sambandh hai
 If k is larger than K, or taller or heavier than K, and b k then it proves that k is taller or heavier than C
 anutplavi sambandh- k kha kaa pita he or kha ga kaa; yahan yah siddh nahin hota ki k ga kaa pita he
 Where we see that the originating relationship is allowed for permission
 arastu dwaara pratipaadit varg samavesh kaa siddhant vastutah utplavi sambandh kaa doosraa udhaaharan akshep sambandh he
 If the sentence y dedicates the sentence r, and the sentence sentences l, then y represents the l
 pratikanishtha tarkshastra kii ek anya visheshta yah he ki vahaan vaakyon or unke sambandhon ko pratikon ke dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Permutation has specific relation to base sentences; These relationships depend on the size of the sentences, not their meanings
 faltah vaakyon ke arthon kaa vichaar kiye bina, unke aakaaron main anusyut sambandhon ko or unpar aadhaarit anumitiyon ko, pratikon kii bhashaa main prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 Various relations can be briefly revealed when symbolized
 yah prakriya ganit kii shlaghneey visheshta he
 The invention of writing numbers with decimal methods was a key to the advancement of mathematics, it was invented in India
 ankon ko likhane kii roman pranali main das, pachaas sau aadi sankhyaon ke liye alag-alag sanketachinh he; iske vipareet prachlit dashamalav pranali main ankavishesh kaa mulya uski sthiti ke anusaar hota he or sif nau ankon tathaa shunya-chihn, kii madad se kisi bhi sankhya ko prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 In symbolic logic, the rules of permissions related to classes, sentences, etc
, have been presented in symbols
 vargkalan main virgon ke parsparik sambandhon, virodh aadi ke niyam batalaaye gaye hai
 Similarly, rules of syntax, opposition etc
 have been stated
 isi prakaar vaakyakalan main vaakyasambandhon ke niamak siddhaton yaa niyamon kaa ullekh rahata he
 The principle embodied in Aristotle's jurisprudence is one of the said rules
 isse prakat he ki pratikanishtha tarkshastra kaa anumitikshetra arestu ke tarkshastra kii apeksha kahin adhik vistrut he
 Peddagudipet is a village in Adilabadu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, in the Bhimini division
