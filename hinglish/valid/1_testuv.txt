 In American culture, talking about something, it is common to say such things as "the Phalana factory is bigger than Mississippi in the west" or "phalana Mountains are higher than Mississippi in the east
" " Mississippi's name comes from a Native American Aboriginal language known as Anishnabe or Ojibwe

 parvat maidan dweep The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei of different origin located in the brain of spinal organisms that function as a combined functional unit
 ve mastishk ke agr bhaag ke aadhaar kshetra main sthit hote hai or cerebral cortex, thilemus tathaa mastishk ke anya kshetron se majbootee se jude hote hai
 The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of tasks, including voluntary mobility control, procedural learning related to daily behavior or "habits", eye movements, cognitive and emotional functions
 vartmaan main lokapriy siddhant basal gangliya ko mukhyatah kriya chayan ke liye jimmedaar maanate hai, arthath is baat kaa nirnay karnaa ki ek samay par vibhinn sambhav vyavhaaron main se kise karnaa he
 Experimental studies show that the basal ganglia exert inhibitory effects on several motile mechanisms, and the motile mechanism is activated as soon as this inhibitory effect is removed
 basal gangliya main "vyavhaar kaa badalanaa" mastisk ke kai hisson se prasaarit hone vaale sanketon se prabhavit hota he, jisamen sammilit he prifrantal cortex jo ki kaaryakari kaamon main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The main components of the basal ganglia are the striatum, also called neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate and putamen, the globus pallidus or pallidum which is composed of the globus pallidus externa or the globus pallidus interna, the substra nigra which is the substra nigra pars compacta and the substra
 The pars consists of the reticulata and the subthalamic nucleus
 The striatum, which is the largest component, receives input from several brain regions but only sends output to other components of the basal ganglia
 palidam sabase mahatvapurn input striatum se praapt karata he or nirodhatmak output gatishiltaa se sambandhit kai kshetron ko bhejtaa he, jisamen sammilit he thilemus kaa hissaa jo cortex ke gatishiltaa se sambandhit kshetron ko ubharta he
 The reticulata, which is a part of the Substenia nigra, acts like the pallidum, and another part called the compacta provides the input of the neuro-transmitter dopamine source to the striatum
 sabathalemic nabhik mukhya rup se striatum tathaa cortex se input praapt karata he or palidam ke hisse ko bhej detaa he
 Each of these regions has an intrinsic structural and neuro-chemical organization
 vibhinn tantrika avasthaaon, jiname kai gatishiltaa se jude vikaar hai, main basal gangliya kendriya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Most notable are Parkinson's disease, in which melanin pigmented dopamine-producing cells collapse in the compacta on the substrainsia nigra and Huntington's disorder in which the striatum is originally damaged
 kuch vyavhar niyantran se jude vikaron main basal gangliya kii akaryakshmata avasthaa bhi pai jaati he, jaise ki, torates syndrome main, belismus, jununee badhyakaari vikaar, evam wilson rog

 The basal ganglia have an extremity-like area with components distinctly named - nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental region
 Efferents provide dopamine to the nucleus accumbens in the same way that the substrains provide dopamine to the nigra dorsal striatum
 chunki aise bahut saare sakshya hai jo darshaate hai ki durlabh adhyayan main isaki kendriya bhoomika hoti he, atah vitie → ene ke dopaminergic prakshepan ne badi sankhya main is ore dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 For example, many highly addictive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine, are thought to act by enhancing the efficacy of the VTA → NA dopamine signal

 The classification of the human nervous system from the point of view of development is often based on 3 basic primitive cavities
 ukt praathmik guhaayen maanav bhrun main neural nalika ke saamaanya vikaas ke samay banati hai or prarambh main isamen rostral se kodal abhivinyas main sammilit rahati hai- procenciphelon, messencephelon, evam robenciphelon guhaayen
 baad main, tantrika tantra ke vikaas ke dauraan, prayek anubhag chote-chote avyavon main parivartit ho jate hai
 The following table shows this developmental classification and follows the body structure found in the basal ganglia
 : The basal ganglia are a basic component of telencyphelone
 iske vipareet, cortics kii parat agramastishk kii sataha ko astr karti hai, jab ki basal gangliya jo ki grey padaarth kaa alag hi dikhaai dene vaala samooh he vah mastishk kii gaharaai main thilemus ke sangam ke sameep hi sthit hota he
 Like most parts of the brain, the basal ganglia also have left and right sides in the form of virtual images of each other
 shaareerik sanrachanaatmak drushti se sharir sanrachana shastriyon ne basal gangliya ko chaar alag-alag sanrachanaon main vibhajit kiya he or yah vibhaajan is par nirbhar karata he ki ukt sanrachana kitni behatar tareeke se rostral hai : inamen se do arthath striatum evam palidam apekshaakrit badi hai, anya do, arthath sabstantia nigra evam sabthelmic nabhik aakaar main choti sanrachana hai
 In the example on the right, the position of the components of the basal ganglia is shown in the two cranial section maps of the human brain
 tipanni ke swarup spasht kiya jaataa he ki, ukt maanchitr main dikhaai na dene vaale, sabthelmic nabhik or sabstantia nigra mastisk main bahut peeche sthit hai
 The striatum is the largest component of the basal ganglia
 striatum kii sanrachana ko kuch vishisht dishaao main kaate jane par dhaariyaan dikhaai detii hai jiname se kai chote-bade tantrika tantuon kaa ugam dikhaai detaa he, isliye iske liye shabd "striatum" prayukt kiya jaataa he
 Earlier anatomy scientists had tested the human brain and understood that the striatum is made up of two different substances that have been isolated by the expansion of a white substance called the internal capsule
 unhone in do padaarthon ko codet or putamin kaa naam diya
 aadhunik sharir sanrachana vaigyanikon ne sookshmdarshi or neuro rasinic adhyayanon dwaara nishkarsh nikaala ki in padaarthon ko ek hi rachana arthath striatum ke do alag hisson ke rup main maananaa uchit he, thik usee tarah, jis tarah kisi nagar ko koi nadi do hisson main pruthak karti he
 Several functional differences between the caudate and putamen have been identified, but are thought to be the result of facts under which each region of the striatum has been found to be essentially connected to specific parts of the cerebral cortex
 striatum kaa aantarik sanghathan asaadhaaran rup se jatil he
 Most of the neurons in it are of the "medium spiny neurons" type
 ve jiabiergik koshikaayen hai jinaki koshika nikaay chote hai or dendrit ghaney dendrytic kaanton se aachhadit hai jinhen syneptic input multah cortex evam thilemus se praapt hote hai
 Medium thorny neurons can be divided into subtypes in several ways, depending on neurochemical and method of attachment
 aglaa sabase adhik bahu-sankhya kaa prakaar, bade, chikani dendrit yukt, colinergik antarneurons hai
 There are many other types of intrinsic neurons, which are small segments of the neural population
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki cortex or striatum ke bich aamtaur par sthalakritik sambandh rahe hai, arthath, cortex kaa prayek hissaa striatum ke kuch bhaag ko, uske baad anya ko, majboot input bhejtaa he
 The nature of the topography is difficult to understand, but, perhaps in part because the organization of the striatum is organized in three dimensions while the cortex, as a layered structure, is held in two
 is aiami visangati ke chalate ek sanrachana kaa duusari par maanchitran karne main badi maatra main virupan or algaav dikhaai padataa he
 Interestingly, the same topographic relationships apply to the thalamus striatal
 palidam globas palids naamak ek badi sanrachana hoti he joki ek chote udar taleey vistaar ke saath sthit hoti he, jise ventral palidam kaha jaataa he
 Globus pallidus appears as a single nerve substance, but due to functional differences can be divided into two parts, those parts are called internal extracellular segments, and also abbreviated as GPI and GPE
 donon khandon main multah jiabergik neurons hote hai, jo unke lakshya par nirodhatmak prabhaav dikhaate hai
 The above two sections participate in different neural circuits
 bahari khand athwa jipii ko pramukh rup se input prapti striatum se hoti he or vah sabathalemus nabhik par prakshepit hota he
 The inner segment, or GPI, receives signals by the striatum through two paths, called "direct" and "indirect" paths
 palidle neurons ek "gaiyr nirodhatmak" siddhant kaa upyog kar kaary karte hai
 The said neurons project at a steady high rate in the absence of input and they are in a state of "stagnation" as indicated by the striatum
 chunki swayan palidle neurons kaa unke lakshyon par nirodhatmak prabhaav he, palidam ko praapt input kaa kul prabhaav palidle koshika dwaara lakshyon par pradarshit niyantrit nirodh ke rup main dikhaai detaa hai
 Substencia nigra is a miscephalic gray matter portion of the basal ganglia that is divided into SNR and SNC
 aksar esaenar jipiai ke saath saamanjasy main kaam karata he evam esaenar - jipiai complex, thilemus kaa nirodhi kaary karata he
 Substantia nigra pars compacta forms the neuro transmitter dopamine, which is very important in balancing the striatal tract
 neeche diya gaya paripath basal gangliya ke avyavon kii bhoomika evam paripath ko samajhaata he
 The subthalamic nucleus is a diencephalic gray matter of the basal ganglia, and is the only part of the ganglia that actually forms the "excitatory" glutamic acid transmitter
 sabathalemic nabhik kii bhoomika esaenar-jipiai complex ko uttejit karnaa he or saath hi vah "apratyaksh maarg" kaa ek hissaa bhi hota he
 To understand the complex circuit of the basal ganglia, we first need to know the important partners of the circuit
 basal gangliya thilemus or cortex ke saath sidhe sampark main hota he
 Therefore, the circuit produced by the basal ganglia consists of the three main partners of the cortex, the thalamus, and the basal ganglia, the basal ganglia
 maanav mastishk cortex, satta kii ucchtam sthiti, evam jagat ke prati jaagruk dharna ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 All functions performed directly or indirectly by the nervous system are related to the cortex
 cortex ke kai alag-alag kshetra bhinn-bhinn kaamon ko anjaam dete hai
 One such part of the pre-central gyrus cortex is also known as the "motor cortex"
 cortex ke motor cortex kshetra ke vishisht neurons apane eksans ko basal gangliya ke striatum bhaag tak vistrut karte hai
 The neurons of the said cortics release the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is stimulating in nature
 glutamet se utsahit hone ke baad striatum main sthit koshikaayen do vibhinn dishaao main prakshepit hokar do pramukh path kaa nirmaan karti hai- "pratyaksh " evam "paroksh " paripath
 Once stimulated by the cortex in the direct circuit, the cells of the striatum produce a neuro-transmitter called anticonvulsant neurons) that the SNR-GPI projects onto complex cells
 esaenar or jipiai, lagaataar jieb nirmit karte hue ansa lenticulaaris paripath dwaara thilemus se sampark main rahete hue us par nirodhatmak prabhaav kriyanvit karne hetu prayatnsheel rahete hai
 Due to the inhibitory effect of SNR-GPI, the final conclusion is the omission of inhibitory effect on the thalamus
 yah dilachasp baat he ki thilemus khud cortex par prakshepit ho lagaataar cortex ko glutamet dwaara uttejit karata he
 Therefore, the direct circuit allows the thalamus to stimulate the cortex
 After being stimulated, the cortex transmits this "stimulation" message to the muscle via the lateral cortico spinal tract, resulting in hyper-kinetic behavior
 nimna aarekh "pratyaksh" maarg darshata he: Cortex - -> Striatum - -> "SNR-GPI" Complex - -> Thalamus - -> Cortex - -> Muscle, etc
 -> vipareet sire par apratyaksh paripath hota he jo ki striatum ke neurons se hi armbh hota he
 As soon as groups of neurons located in the striatum are stimulated by the cortex, the inhibitory axons now transmit anticonvulsant signals to cells of the globus pallidus externa
 jipii sabathalemic nabhik ko lagaataar nirodhi prabhaav darshaate hai
 stns are actually stimulated by the anticonvulsant effect
 iske falswaroop estn bhi tatpar hokar complex esaenar-jipiai ko uttejit karte hai, jahaan esaenar - jipiai complex kaa mukhya kaary thilemus par nirodhi prabhaav daalana hota he
 As a result, there is a decrease in the action of the thalamus by the thalamus to actually stimulate the cortex
 iske falswaroop cortex, parshv cortico spinal tract dwaara mansapeshiyon ko kam uttejit kar, ati gatij sthiti athwa gati main kami, main sahyog karata he
 In short, direct and indirect circuits are conflicting in performance
 cortex - -> striatum - -> jipii - -> estn - -> "esaenar-jipiai" complex - -> thilemus - -> cortex - -> mansapeshiyon, aadi -> However, if the direct circuit helps the motion and the indirect circuit does not help, then there is a paradox about the innate voluntary motion in the human body
 is virodhabhas kaa nidaan substenshia nigra pars compecta ke karyanvayan dwaara hota he jo dopamine kaa utpaadan karte hai
 Dopamine has specific D1 receptors located in the basal ganglia to stimulate the "direct" pathway, while dopamine has specific antagonistic effects on specific D2 receptors located in the basal ganglia and actually helps the "indirect pathway"
 is tarah sharir, gati evam uski anupasthiti ke bich taratamya rakh santulit sthiti kaa nirmaan karata he
 In this delicate system, due to an unbalanced condition, diseases such as Parkinson's disorder arise
 basal gangliya or uske avyavon kaa namakaran hameshaa samasyagrast rahaa he
 By looking at the anatomical structure of the former anatomist, but being unaware of the cellular construction of neural chemistry, he accumulated components that are now believed to carry out different functions, and thus They gave different names to the components which are now understood to be parts of the same structure, from a functional point of view
 "basal" shabd is tathy se upja he ki iske adhikansh tatv agramastishk ke basal hisse main sthit hai
 The term ganglia is a misnomer: in modern usage, only the neural / neural groups of the peripheral nervous system are referred to as "ganglia" while the neural / neural groups of the central nervous system are called "nuclei"
 is kaaran se, basal gangliya ko kabhi kabhi "basal nabhik" ke naam se bhi janaa he
 Terminological Anatomica, the international authority for anatomy nomenclature, has suggested the name "nucleus basalis", which is not commonly used
 antarrashtriya basal gangliya sosayadi anaupchaarik rup se maanati he ki basal gangliya yah striatum, palidam, substenshia nigra evam sabathalemic nabhik se bana he
 Percheron etc
, in 1991 and Parent and Parent in 2005 included the central part of the thalamus as a part of the basal ganglia, while mena-segovia etc
 also included the pedunculopontine complex in 2004
 iske alaava, basal gangliya ke vibhinn nabhikon ko die gaye naam bhinn-bhinn hai
 In particular, the inner segment of the globus pallidus of the primordial human is called the antopeduncular nucleus in mice
 aadi maanav main "striatum" or "globas palids" ke bahari khand ko pakshiyon main kramshah "peleostriatum augmentatom" or "peleostriatum primitivem" kaha jaataa he
 Anatomy studies, mainly anatomical studies of mice and apes, and studies of the disorders that damage them, provide information about the functions of the basal ganglia
 basal gangliya ke vishay main vistrut jaankaree kaa sabase bada strot do tantrika shaastra ke vikaar, parkinsons rog tathaa hantington rog hai
 For both of these disorders, nerve damage can be well known and correlated with the resulting symptoms
 parkingsanse rog main, ssabstenshia nigra main sthit dopaminargik koshikaon kaa bada nuksaan hota he, hantington rog main striatum main sthit madhyam kantedaar neurons kaa baari nuksaan hota he
 The symptoms of the two diseases are almost opposite - Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of ability to function, while Huntington's disease is characterized by an inability to prevent movement of parts of the body voluntarily
 yah ullekhneey he ki, haalanki donon bimariyon ke lakshan unke sangyanatmak unnat charan main vishesh rup se he, sabase pramukh lakshan, gatividhi ke armbh evam unke niyantran kii kshamta se sambandhit hai
 Thus, both disorders are mainly classified into malaise of activity
 ek bhinn kism kaa, gatividhi kii aswasthta se sambandhit rog, jise hemibelismus naam se janaa jaataa he or sabathelamic nabhik kii kshati ke chalate hota he
 Symptoms of hemibellism are violent and uncontrolled movements of hands and feet

 mastishk kshetron kaa vyapak jaal netron kii gati / halchal ko prabhavit karata he jo madhya mastisk ke superior kulikulus naamak kshetra main kendrit hota he
 The SC is a layered structure whose levels form two-dimensional maps of the visual site
 essi ke staron kii gaharaai main tantrika gatividhi kii ek "takkar" netron kii halchal ko dekhe gaye kisi bindu par nirdeshit karti he
 The SC receives a strong inhibitory projection from the BG originating from the substra nigra pars reticulata
 esaenar main sthit neurons aamtaur par ucch dar se prakshepit hote he, kintu netra kii halchal ke armbh hote hi ve "tham" jate hai or nirodhatmak prabhaav se essi chhodte he
 All types of eye movements in SNR are associated with "stopping" - but individual SNR neurons may be more strongly associated with certain types of movement / movement
 codet nabhik ke kuch bhaagon main ke neurons bhi netra kii halchal se sambandhit gatividhi darshaate hai
 Since a large number of caudate cells are projecting at a low rate, this action is most often exhibited as an increase in the rate of projection
 codet nabhik main uttejnaa se netron kii halchal armbh hoti he, joki esaenar par sidhe jiabergik prakshepanon ke marfat nirodhi prabhaav pradarshit karti he
 Although the role of the basal ganglia in motor control is clear, it is known from several indications that it is fundamentally involved in the control of behavior to the level of motivation
 parkingsanse rog main, avyavon kii halchal kii kshamta kaa nishpaadan adhiktar prabhavi nahin hota, kintu prerak kaarak jaise ki bhukh, halchal kaa armbh karne main vifal he athwa use uchit samay par jari karne main asafal he
 Parkinson also describes sedation in patients sometimes with "paralysis of desire"

 The role of the extremities resembling the basal ganglia in inducing - that is, the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area is particularly well established
 hajaaron prayogtmak adhyayan dikhaate hai ki vitie se ene tak dopaminargik prakshepan, mastisk ke pratifal tantra main kendiy bhoomika nibhaate he
 Animals implanted with stimulating electrodes will become agitated as soon as they press the button if the electric current is continued for short intervals after each button press
 There are many things that people feel like a byproduct, including addictive drugs, flavored food and sex, have shown that the VTA dopamine system has been effective

 The basal ganglia are one of the basic components of the forebrain and can be identified in vertebrate species
 balki, lampre main bhi strietal, palidle or nigral shaareerik rachana evam koshika rasayan / hystology ke aadhaar par pahachaane ja sakate hai
 a clearly emerging issue is the comparative anatomy of the basal ganglia, the development of this mechanism through phylogeny, as a combination of convergent and recessive traps with respect to the skin, leading to the development and propagation of the skin cover

 For many years, the term corpus striatum, used for large groups of subcortical elements, later became known that some of them have no functionally related relationship
 kai saalon tak, putamin or codet nabhik ek duusare se jude nahin the
 Instead, putamen was associated with the pallidum, which was labeled the nucleus lenticularis or nucleus lentiformis

 The striatum was named after the striped motif created by the sheen of dense bundles of striato-pelido-nigral axons, described by anthropologist Alexander Kinnie Wilson as "like a pencil"
 apane mul lakshyon ke saath striatum kii sanrachanaatmak kadi ko palidam or substenshia nigra se baad khoja gaya tha
 The name Globus Pallidus was given in 1822 by Deserine Toe Burdac
 is ke liye, vogts ne saral naam "palidam" prastaavit kiya tha
 The term "locus niger" was introduced as tache noir by Felix vic-d'azir, although the structure has since been known as Substensia nigra in 1788 due to von Sommering's contribution
 mirato ne 1896 main globas palids or substenshia nigra ke bich sanrachanaatmak samanta kaa ullekh kiya tha
 The two together are known as the Pallidonigral Ensemble, which is the central part of the basal ganglia

 Is classified into
 drudh eks-re thos vastuon ko bhed sakati hai or inkaa sabase zyada istemaal naidanik radiography or crystalography main vastuon kii andruni tasviren lene ke liye kiya jaataa he
 As a result, the term X-ray is used to refer to a radiographic photograph produced by the use of this method in addition to the method itself
 iske vipareet, kaha jaataa he ki mridu eks-re badi mushkil se kisi padaarth ko puri tarah se bhed sakati hai; udhaaharan ke liye, jal main 600 electro volt tarangadairghy vaali eks-re kaa kshinandairghy 1 micrometer se bhi kam hota he
 X-rays are a type of ionizing radiation and exposure to them can be harmful to health
 haal ke dashakon main eks-re or gamma kirnon ke bich ke vibhed main badlaav aayaa he
 Originally, the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted from X-ray tubes was longer than the wavelength of radiation emitted from radioactive nuclei

 However, groups of wavelengths overlapped extensively as continuous spectrum "x-ray" sources with relatively short wavelengths, such as linear accelerators and "gamma ray" emitters with relatively long wavelengths, were discovered
 aajkal saamanytah vikiran ke do prakaaron ko unke mul ke aadhaar par alag kiya jaataa he: eks-re nabhik ke baahar sthit electronon dwaara utsarjit hoti hai jabaki gamma kirane nabhik dwaara utsarjit hoti hai
 The measurement of the ionizing potential of an X-ray is called the unveiling: haalanki padaarth par insheel vikiran kaa prabhaav utpann aavesh kii apeksha unamem jamaa urja kii maatra se bahut kareeb se sambandhit hota he
 The measure of this absorbed energy is called the absorbed quantity: samatuly maatra, maanav utak par vikiran ke jaivik prabhaav kii maap he
 As for X-rays, it is equal to the absorbed volume
 medical eks-re, maanav nirmit vikiran anaavaran kaa ek mahatvapurn strot he, jinka pariman 1987 main sanyukt rajya america main 58% tha, lekin chunki adhikansh vikiran anaavaran, prakritik hote hai, isliye medical eks-re kaa pariman, kul america vikiran anaavaran kaa keval 10 pratishat hota he

 X-rays are generated from the X-ray tube, which is a vacuum tube using a high voltage to increase the speed of free electrons by a hot cathode to a high velocity
 ucch veg vaale electron, anode naamak ek dhatvik lakshya se takaraate hai, jisase eks-re kaa nirmaan hota he
 In medical X-ray tubes, the target is usually tungsten or a highly resistant alloy of rhenium and tungsten, but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as in mammography when soft X-rays are needed
 
 crystalography main, ek tambe kaa lakshya sabase aam he, jiske saath aksar cobalt kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jab namoonay main louh padaarth kii pratidipti se anyathaa ek samasya utpann ho sakati he
 The maximum energy of a photon of the generated X-ray is limited by the energy of the electrons that are equal to the voltage of the tube, so a tube of 80 kv cannot produce an X-ray with more energy than 80 kg electro volts
 jab electron, lakshya par prahaar karte hai, tab do alag-alag parmanvik prakriyaaon dwaara eks-re kaa nirmaan hota he: Therefore the resulting product of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrolung spectrum falling to zero at the voltage of the tube and also several spikes along characteristic lines
 naidanik eks-re naliyon main prayukt voltage or is tarah eks-re kii ucchtam urja lagbhag 20 se 150 kevi tak hoti he
 In medical clinical applications, low-energy X-rays are unwanted because the body absorbs them completely, necessitating increased volume

 The design of the X-ray tube should be such that it can circulate this excess heat
 vikruti vigyaan ke ek vyapak varnakram kii pahchaan karne ke liye eks-re ke istemaal se praapt radiograph kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Since the anatomical structures being visualized in medical applications are larger than the wavelengths of X-rays, X-rays can be analyzed as particles rather than waves
 maanav yaa pashu asthiyon ke eks-re kaa ek chitra banane ke liye, laghu eks-re spandan, sharir yaa ang ko prakashit karte hai or iske peeche radiographic film rakhi hoti he

 Sugarcane is cultivated in India on about 32 lakh hectares of land, yielding 1,800 lakh tonnes of sugarcane
 is prakaar ganne kii ausat upaj lagbhag 57 ton prati hactor he jo utpaadan-kshamta se kaaphi kam he
 If the farmer brothers know when and how much fertilizer should be given to the sugarcane and when and how to irrigate it, they can increase the yield of sugarcane to a great extent
 hamaare desh main ganne ke liye prayukt kshetra ko dekhte hue uski upaj apekshaakrit kam he
 The main reason for this is the need to use manure-water facilities and not using them at the right time
 desh main kul boye gayi fasal-kshetra ke lagbhag 43 pratishat bhaag par sinchai-suvidha uplabdh he
 If viewed from the point of view of irrigation facilities for various crops, sugarcane is only 0

 Sugarcane crop always requires moisture, but it is very important to have sufficient moisture in the soil at the time of deposition, calving and elongation

 In addition, the US NRC and the US Department of Energy have begun research into the sustainability of lightwater reactors that are expected to allow reactor licenses to extend beyond 60 years, with an increase of 20 years, provided that safety is maintained
 To be retained, as non-co2-emission generating capacity by returning reactors "may challenge US energy security, potentially leading to greenhouse gas emissions
" May increase Srgn and power of an imbalance between demand and supply
 " In 2008, the International Atomic Energy Agency forecast that nuclear power capacity could double by 2030, although this would not be sufficient to increase the nuclear share of electricity generation
 jis prakaar kai paramparaagat tapiya urja centre, jeevashm eendhan ke jalane se nikalne vaali taap urja ke dohan se bijli utpann karte hai, vaise hi parmaanu urja sanyantr, aam taur par parmaanu vikhandan ke madhyam se ek parmaanu ke nabhik se nikali urja ko parivartit karte hai
 When a relatively large fissile atomic nucleus absorbs a neutron, fission of that atom often results
 vikhandan, parmaanu ko gatij urja ke saath do yaa do se adhik chote nabhik main vibhajit karata he or gamma vikiran or mukt neutron ko bhi chodta he
 a portion of these neutrons can be absorbed later by another fissile atom and more fission can occur, which will release more neutrons and so on

 Fusion reactors, which may become viable in the future, will reduce or eliminate many of the risks associated with nuclear fission
 ek parmaanu riector, parmaanu urja ke liye jivan chakra kaa hi hissaa he
 This process starts with mining
 Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines
 kisi bhi haalat main, uranium ayask ko nikaala jaataa he, aamtaur par ek sthir or thos rup main parivartit kiya jaataa he, jaise yallokek or phir use kisi prasanskaran suvidha main bheja jaataa he
 Here, the yolkok is converted into uranium hexafluoride, which is then cultured using various techniques

 Fuel rods complete about three operational cycles inside the reactor, typically until about 3% of their uranium is broken down, then sent to a spent fuel pool where the short-lived isotopes generated by fission are destroyed
 ek shitalk talab main lagbhag 5 saal ke baad, kharchit eendhan radiodharmee or tapiya aadhaar par sanbhaalane ke liye paryaapt thanda ho chukaa hota he or use shushk bhandaaran pipon main rakhaa ja saktaa he yaa punah sanvardhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Uranium is a fairly common element found in the earth's crust
 uranium lagbhag utana hi aam he jitna bhu-parpati main tin yaa jarmenium kaa paaya janaa or rajat kii tulana main yah 35 guna aam he
 Uranium is a component of most rocks, dust, and oceans
 yah tathy ki uranium itnaa bikharaa hua he, ek samasya he, kyonki uranium khanan aarthik rup se keval vahiin vyavhaarya he jahaan badi maatra main iskaa sankendran ho
 Nonetheless, the world's currently unexplored uranium resources, which can be economically recovered at a cost of 130 USD / kg, are sufficient to last "at least a century" according to the current rate of consumption
 adhikansh khanijon kii saamaanya tulana main, yah nishchit sansadhano ke ek ucch str ko darshata he
 On the basis of conformance with other metallic minerals, a doubling in price from the current level can be expected to increase the measured resources by tenfold over time
 haalanki, parmaanu urja kii laagat, mukhyatah vidyut centre ke nirmaan main nihit he
 Therefore, fuel's contribution to the total cost of electricity produced is relatively small, so an excessive fuel price increase will have relatively little effect on the final price
 udhaaharan ke liye, aam taur par uranium kii bazaar keemat kaa ek doharikaran, halke jal ke riector ke liye eendhan kii keemat main 26% kii vruddhi karegaa or bijli kii laagat main kareeb 7%, jabaki prakritik gas kii keemat main duguni vruddhi, aam taur par bijli kii keemat main us strot se 70% kii badhotaree karegi
 At sufficiently high prices, eventual extraction from sources, such as granite and seawater, becomes economically possible

 Thorium is 3
5 times more common in uppermost uranium and has different geographical characteristics
 yah kul vyaavhaarik vikhandan-yogya sansaadhan aadhaar ko 450% tak badha degaa
 Unlike the production of U-238 as plutonium, fast breeder reactors are not necessary - this can be satisfactorily edited in more conventional plants
 bharat ne is takanic main jhaankne kii koshish kii he, kyonki iske paas prachur maatra main thorium bhandar hai lekin uranium thodaa hi he
 Advocates of fusion energy commonly propose the use of deuterium or tritium as fuels, both being isotopes of hydrogen and boron and lithium in many current designs
 By assuming a fusion energy output equal to current global production and assuming that it will not increase in the future, the known current lithium reserves will last 3000 years, the lithium of seawater will run 60 million years, and a more complex fusion process that seawater Se uses only deuterium and will have fuel for the next 150 billion years

 The most important waste stream from nuclear power plants is spent nuclear fuel
 It is mainly composed of unchanged uranium as well as significant amounts of transsuranic actinides
 In addition, about 3% of it is a fission product derived from the nuclear reaction
 actenids lambi avadhi kii radiodharmita ke bade hisse ke liye jimmedaar hai, jabaki vikhandan utpaada, alpavadhi kii radiodharmita ke bade hisse ke liye jimmedaar hai
 After a nuclear fuel rod reacts 5 percent inside a nuclear reactor, the rod is no longer fit to be used as fuel
 Today, scientists are figuring out how to make these rods reusable so that waste can be reduced and the remaining actinides can be used as fuel
 ek theth 1000-megawatt parmaanu riector, prati varsh kareeb 20 cubic meter kharchit parmaanu eendhan ko utpann karata he 
 america main sabhi vanijyik parmaanu urja sanyantr dwaara aaj kii taarikh tak utpann kharchit eendhan, ek footbal maidan ko ek meter tak bhar saktaa he
 The spent nuclear fuel is initially very high radioactive and therefore must be handled with utmost care and premeditated manner
 haalanki, hajaaron varshon kii avadhi ke dauraan yah kaaphi kam radiodharmee ho jaataa he
 After 40 years, the radiation flux is 99
9%, lower than the moment the spent fuel is removed from operation, although the spent fuel is still dangerously radioactive
 radiodharmee kshay ke 10,000 varshon ke baad, america paryaavaran sangrakshan agency ke maanakon ke anusaar, kharchit parmaanu eendhan se saarvajanik swasthya or suraksha ko koi khatra nahin hoga
 When first extracted, spent fuel rods are stored in water-protected basins, which are usually on site
 yah pani donon pradaan karata he, ab bhi nasht hote vikhandan utpaadon ke liye shitalan or jari rahane vaali radiodharmita se parirakshan

 Currently most US nuclear waste is stored at the site where it originates, while suitable permanent disposal methods are being discussed
 yatha 2007, sanyukt rajya america, parmaanu riektaron se nikle 50,000 metric ton se adhik kharchit parmaanu eendhan ko jamaa kar chukaa he
 Permanent underground storage in the US was proposed at the Yucca Mountains nuclear waste reserves, but that project has now been effectively scrapped - the permanent disposal of US high-level waste remains an as-yet unresolved political problem

 phir bhi, actenids ko hataa dene ke baavjood bachaa hua apshisht, kam se kam 300 varshon tak ke liye kaaphi radiodharmee hoga or yadi actenids ko andar hi chhod diya jaataa he to hazaron saal tak ke liye
 Even after removing all actinides and destroying long-lived non-actinides by conversion using fast breeder reactors, it is necessary to keep the waste away from the atmosphere for a hundred years to a few hundred years and therefore Are properly classified as a long-term problem
 up-jokhim riector yaa sanlayan riector bhi kachare ko jamaa kiye jane kii avadhi ko kam kar sakate hai
 It has been argued that the best solution for nuclear waste is temporary storage above ground, as technology is changing rapidly

 The nuclear industry also produces large quantities of low-level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated materials, such as textiles, hand-tools, water purifier resins, and materials from which the reactor itself is made

 In countries with nuclear power, radioactive waste accounts for less than 1% of the total industrial toxic waste, the vast majority of which remain hazardous indefinitely
 kul milakar, jeevashm-eendhan aadhaarit vidyut sanyantron kii tulana main parmaanu urja dwaara utpann apshisht padaarthon kii maatra kaaphi kam hoti he
 Coal-fired plants are particularly known to produce toxic and mild radioactive ash due to the concentration of naturally occurring metals and the dim radioactive material emitted from coal
 a recent report by Oak Ridge National Laboratory has concluded that coal energy actually delivers more radioactivity to the atmosphere than nuclear energy operations, and that the population effective dose, equivalent to the radiation of the coal plant, from the ideal operation of the nuclear plant 100 times more
 beshak, koyale kii raakh, parmaanu kachare se kaaphi kam radiodharmee he, lekin raakh vaataavaran main sidhe jaati he, jabaki parmaanu sanyantr, vikiranit riector pot, eendhan chaden or site par kisi bhi radiodharmee apshisht se paryaavaran kii suraksha ke liye parirakshan kaa upyog karte hai
 By reprocessing, potentially 95% of plutonium and uranium from the spent nuclear fuel can be recovered by putting it into mixed oxide fuel
 isse bache hue kachare ke bheetar dirghakaalik radiodharmita main kami hoti he, kyonki yah kaaphi had tak ek alpakaalik vikhandan utpaada he or 90% se adhik ek apni maatra kam kar letaa he
 Reprocessing of civilian fuel from energy reactors is currently done extensively in Britain, France and Russia and will soon be done in China and perhaps also in India, and is being done on a larger scale in Japan
 punarsansaadhan kii purna kshamta ko hasil nahin kiya gaya he kyonki iske liye 0}breader riector kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo abhi tak vanijyik rup se uplabdh nahin he
 
 France is known as the most successful reprocessor, but it reprocesses only 28% of the currently used annual fuel, 7% within France and the remaining 21% in Russia
 anya deshon ke vipareet, america ne 1976 se 1981 tak, america aprasar niti ke ek hisse ke rup main naagarik punarsansaadhan ko roak diya, kyonki punarsansaadhit saamagree jaise plutonium ko parmaanu hathiyaaron main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: haalanki, america main punarsansaadhan kii ab anumati he
 Nevertheless, all spent nuclear fuel in the US is currently considered waste
 farvari, 2006 main, ek nai america pahal, vaishvik parmaanu urja bhagidaari kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 It will be an international effort to reprocess fuel in a way that makes nuclear proliferation unviable, while developing countries will have nuclear power available
 uranium sanvardhan, kai ton ke rikt uranium ko utpann karata he, jo U-238 se bana hota he jisamen se, aasaani se vikhandaneey U-235 isotope ko hataa diya gaya hota he
 The U-238 is a rigid metal with many commercial uses - for example, aircraft production, radiation shielding and armor - because it has a higher density than lead
 rikt uranium, hathiyaaron main bhi upyogi he jaise DU penitrater kaa "self shorpen", jisaki vajah he katarani band ke saath fracture kii uranium kii pravriti
 There are also concerns that U-238 may pose a health hazard to groups that are excessively exposed to this material, such as tank crew and citizens who live in areas where DU ammunition a large amount of it has been used in shielding, bombs, missiles, blast heads and bullets
 janvari 2003 main vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne ek report khoj ko jari kiya ki DU yuddh saamagree se sandushan sthaneey kshetra main prabhaav sthal se kuch dasiyon meter tak tha or sthaneey vanaspati or jal kaa sandushan 'behad kam' tha
 The report also states that about 70% of the DU consumed will leave the body after twenty four hours and 90% after a few days
 parmaanu urja sanyantron kaa arthshaastra, mukhya rup se vishaal praarambhik nivesh se prabhavit hota he jo ek sanyantr kaa nirmaan karne ke liye aavashyak he
 In 2009, the cost of a new plant in the US is estimated to be between $ 6 to $ 10 billion

 a prestigious panel formed to study the industry for the 2003 MIT found the following: MIT adhyayan ne parmaanu riector ke jivan ke liye ek 40 varsh kii aadhaar-rekha kaa istemaal kiya
 Many existing plants have been extended beyond this period to operate well and studies have shown that extending the life of the plant to 60 years dramatically reduces its overall cost

 It has often been claimed that nuclear centers are not flexible in their production, meaning that other forms of energy will be needed to meet peak demand

 The controversy over nuclear power was at its peak during the 1970s and 1980s, when it "became so severe that technology was unprecedented in history" in some countries
 parmaanu urja ke samarthakon kaa tark he ki parmaanu urja ek samposhneey urja strot he jo videshi tel par nirbharta ko kam karte hue carbon utsarjan ko kam karata he or urja suraksha ko badhaata he
 Proponents claim that nuclear power, unlike the major viable alternative to fossil fuels, does not actually cause any conventional air pollution, such as greenhouse gas and art smoke
 Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable way for most Western countries to achieve energy dependence
 samarthakon kaa daawa he ki kachare ke bhandaaran kaa jokhim chota he or jise nae riektaron main naveenatam praudyogiki ke upyog dwaara aage kam kiya ja saktaa he or pashchimi vishwa main anya prakaar ke pramukh urja sanyantron kii tulana main, parichaalan suraksha itihaas utkrisht rahaa he
 Opponents believe that nuclear power poses a threat to people and the environment

 unka yah bhi tark he ki riector khud atyadhik jatil mashine hai jahaan bahut si baaten galat ho sakati hai yaa kar sakati hai or kai gambhir parmaanu durghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 Critics do not believe that the risk of using nuclear fission as a source of energy can be adjusted through the development of new technology
 unka yah bhi tark he ki jab parmaanu eendhan shrinkhalaa ke sabhi urja-gahan charnon par dhyaan diya jaataa he, uranium khanan se lekar parmaanu kaaryamukti tak, parmaanu urja, ek nimna-carbon vidyut strot nahin he
