 Lac insects are very fine and produce lacquer from their body and provide us financial assistance
 vaigyanik bhashaa main lakh ko 'lecifer lakh' kaha jaataa he
 The word 'lac' originated from the Sanskrit word 'laksh', possibly due to the emergence of countless baby insects from the female corpus

 Today the importance of lac is due to the resin present in it, but now hundreds of cheap resins have been synthesized and they are sold on a large scale
