 chhandashastra isaliye atyant pusht shaastra mana jaataa he kyonki vah ganit par aadhaarit he
 In fact, it seems that the scripture has been designed so that the advance child can make verses based on its rules
 chandashastra ke granthon ko dekhne se yah bhi gyaat hota he ki jahaan ek ore acharya prastaaradi ke dwaara chando ko viksit karte rahe vahiin duusari ore kavigan apni ore se chhandon main kinchit parirvan karte hue naveen chhandon kii sristi karte rahe jinka chandashastra ke grathon main kalantar main samavesh ho gaya
 No definite consideration can be given as to when the verses were composed
 kinvadanti he ki maharishi valmiki adikavi hai or unka ramayana naamak kavy adikavy he
 Ma nishad pratishtam twam gham: shashwati sama: yatkraunchamithunadekamavadhi:, kammohitam - This anushtupa versa is the first stanza emanating from the mouth of Valmiki, which manifested itself in the form of a shloka suddenly
 yadi is kinvadanti ko maan liya jaae, chand kii rachana pehle hui or chandashastra uske pashchaat aayaa
 In the Valmikya Ramayana, the use of anusthupa verses has been practiced, other subcastes etc
 are also used in abundance

 Garuda accepted this and the rest began to teach him the verses
 vividh chhandon ke rachananium bataate hue ant main shesh ne "bhujangprayati" chand kaa niyam bataaya or sheeghra hi samudr main pravesh kar gaye
 Garuda said on this that you cheated us, the rest replied that we gave you information before leaving
 chaturbhimkare bhujangprayati arthath chaar ganon se bhujang prayaat chand banataa he or prayukt hota he
 In this way, the emergence of metaphysics
 isse prathit hota he
 That metaphysics appeared as a divine discipline
 is prakaar bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki iske aavishkkarta shesh naamak koi acharya the jinke vishay main is samay kuch vishesh gyaan or soochna nahin he
 After this, it is said that Shesha took the incarnation as Pingalacharya, composed Chhandasutra, which is called Pingalashastra
 yah granth sutarastyli main likhaa gaya he or is samay tak uplabdh he
 Commentaries and explanations have been done on this
 yahi chandashastra kaa sarvapratham granth mana jaataa he
 After this, many texts were composed in Sanskrit literature on this scripture
 chandashastra ke rachiyataaon ko do shreniyon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he : ek acharya shrenee, jo chandashastra kaa shastreey nirupan karti he or duusari kavi shrenee, jo chandashastra par pruthak rachanaayen prastut karti he
 Shortly afterward, an author category appeared and which included such writers who interpret the verses of the verses on their own, but cite examples from other composed and popular passages
 hindi main bhi chandashastra par anek granth likhe gaye hai
 The two main topics of thought in the scripture are: chand mukhyat: do prakaar ke hai : Whose Prayong is found in the Vedas
 inamen hrasv, deergh, plut or swarit, in chaar prakaar ke swaron kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he, yatha "anushtup" ityadi
 Vedic verses are considered apaurusheya
 inkaa prayog saahatyantargat kiya jaataa hai, kintu vastut: loukik chand ve chand hai jinka prachaar saamaanya lok athwa janasamudaay main rahata he
 These verses are not based on any fixed rules, but are especially based on rhythm and rhythm, so they are composed by the normal unread people
 loukik chhandon se taatpary hota he un chhandon se jinaki rachana nishchit niyamon ke aadhaar par hoti he or jinka prayog supathit kavi kavyadi rachana main karte hai
 The scripture-related rules of these temporal verses are systematically laid down in the scripture is known as metaphysics
 chhandon kaa vibhaajan varnon or matraaon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 The verses are first considered to be of two types: Varnic and Matric
 inamen vritton kii sankhya nishchit rahati he
 There are also two types of it - negative and non-negative
 ganaatmak vanink chhandon ko vrutt bhi kehete hai
 Their composition is based on the Ganas made of three short and long ganas
 laghu tathaa deergh ke vichaar se yadi varnon k prastaaravyavastha kii jaae aath rup banate hai
 These are called "eight ganas", in which B, N, M, y are considered auspicious and J, R, S, t are considered inauspicious
 vaakya ke aadi main pratham chaar ganon kaa prayog uchit he, antim chaar kaa prayog nishiddh he
 If you want to use only the verses starting with inauspicious Ganas, you should use the word Devatavachi or Mangalavachi or the first word - it removes Ganodosh
 in ganon main paraspar mitra, shatru or udasin bhav mana gaya he
 The combination of two ganas is considered in the beginning of the verses
 varnon ke laghu evam deergh maanane kaa bhi niyam he
 Short vowels or characters with one volume are considered to be short or descent and one volume is considered
 deergh swaron se yukt sanyukt varnon se purv kaa laghu varna bhi visarg yukt or anuswaar varna tathaa chand kaa varna deergh mana jaataa he
 Negative chromatic circles are those in which the idea of ganas is not kept, only the idea of a fixed number of varnas is kept
 In particular mathematical verses only the definite idea of quantities is kept and it is based on a particular rhythm or tempo
 isaliye ye chand laypradhan hote hai
 Varnic verses are kept according to the Varnas
 teen varnon ke samooh ko gana kehete hai
 The names of these ganas are: Yagan, Magan, Tagan, Ragan, Jagan, Bhagana, Nagan and Sagana
 akele laghu ko ‘l’ or guru ko ‘ga’ kehete hai
 The following formula is helpful to know what order of the minor guru in which gana- jis gana ko jaananaa ho uskaa varna is main dekhakar agle do varna or saath jod lete hai or usee kram se gana kii matraayen laga lete hai, jaise: They are called Adilaghu or Adiguru, based on the only quantity in quantities
 jisamen sab guru he, vah ‘magan’ sarvaguru kahalaaya or sabhi laghu hone se ‘nagan’ sarvalaghu kahalaaya
 In Sanskrit, most of the alphabetic verses are taught; Less than mere verses
 sanskrit main is kaa naam 'dohadika' chand he
 There are thirteen-thirteen in its odd stages and eleven-eleven in even stages
 visham charnon ke aadi main
 ऽ
 is prakaar kaa maatra-kram nahin hona chahie or ant main guru or laghu varna hone chahie
 The rhyme of even steps should be found among themselves
 jaise: This couplet has been marked with both odd and even steps in the first line
 isi prakaar duusari pankti main bhi aap donon charnon par ye chihn laga sakate hai
 Therefore, Doha is a semiscriptive meter
 harigitika chand main prayek charan main 28 matraayen hoti hai or ant main laghu or phir guru varna avashya hona chahie
 Yeti is followed by 16 and 12 quantities; like is chand main prayek charan main chhbbees matraayen hoti hai or 14 tathaa 12 matraaon ke baad yeti hoti he
 like: chhandon kaa vibhaajan matraaon or varnon kii charan-bhed-sambandhi vibhinn sankhyaon par aadhaarit he
 In this way the verses are even, odd, half-hearted
 sam chhandon main chand ke chaaron charnon main varnaswarasankhya samaan rahati he
 The first, third and second and fourth alphabet numbers in Ardhasam remain the same
 visham chand ke chaaron charnon main varnon evam swaron kii sankhya asmaan rahati he
 These characters are mutually distinct, and after a certain number of letters and quantities, verses consisting of a majority of letters and vowels are called dandaks
 inaki sankhya bahut adhik he
 The verses can then be divided in other ways as well
 swatantra chand or mishrit chand
 The independent verse is composed by the same rule
 mishrit chand do prakaar ke he : The frequency of the fourth phase of the couplet is added to the first phase of the couplet by joining the couplet and rolla, and the initial few words of the couplet are placed at the end of the roll
 duusare prakaar kaa mishrit chand he "chappay" jisamen chaar charan rola ke dekar do ullala ke die jate hai
 That is why it is called Shaxtadi or Chappay
 inke dekhne se yah gyaat hota he ki chhandon kaa vikaas na keval prastaar ke aadhaar par hi hua he varan kaviyon ke dwaara chand-mishran-vidhi ke aadhaar par bhi hua he
 Similarly, some verses have come in the form of the opposite form of a single verse, as the opposite of couplets is Soratha
 aisa prathit hota he ki kaviyon ne bahudhaa isi ek chand main do ek varna athwa maatra badha ghataakar bhi chand main roopaantar kar nayaa chand banaaya he
 This stanza may fall under the passage
 laghu chhandon ko chhodkar bade chhandon kaa ek charan jab ek baar main puraa nahin padhaa ja saktaa, usamen rachana ke rukne kaa sthaan nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 This break is called Yeti
 yeti ke vichaar se chand phir do prakaar ke ho jate hai- The whole idea of elegance is laid out by the musical element in the verses
 praaia: sabhi chand kisi na kisi rup main gey ho jate hai
 Not all verses with raga and ragini can be said in verses
 isi liye "geeti" naam se katipay pad rache jate hai
 Often, in musical terms, the vowel mount and the descent are often shortened to short, long to short and short to short
 kabhi kabhi hindi ke chhandon main deergh e or o jaise swaron ke laghu roopon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he

 Hepatitis c virus is spread by blood to blood contact
 Most people have little, if any, symptoms after the initial infection, although 85% of the victims carry the virus in the liver
 Permanent infection can be cured by standard treatment such as medicines, peginterferon and ribavirin
 Over fifty-one percent have been fully recovered
 Those who get cirrhosis or liver cancer need a liver transplant and the virus goes completely after the transplant

 Acute hepatitis c refers to the first 6 months of infection with HCV
 60% to 70% of infected people do not show any symptoms during the acute phase
 a small number of patients experience symptoms of acute phase, they are usually mild and common and rarely help in diagnosing hepatitis C
 Acute hepatitis c infection includes reduced appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, itching, and flu-like symptoms
 Hep c genotypes 2A and 3A have the highest rates of relapse at 81% and 74%, respectively

 The natural flow of chronic hepatitis c varies from person to person
 However, evidence of inflammation has been found in liver biopsy of all persons infected with HCV
 The rate of development of liver scarring varies among different individuals
 Over time, it is difficult to accurately assess the risk because very little time is available to test for this virus

 Long-term hepatitis c reaches a state of cirrhosis in the event of decreased liver function or excessive pressure on liver transmission
 This condition is called portal hypertension
 Possible signs and symptoms of liver cirrhosis include ascites ascites, injury and tendency to bleed and signs of varices, jaundice and cognitive impairment known as hepatic encephalopathy
 The accumulation of ammonia and other substances causes hepatic encephalopathy, which is usually cleared by a healthy liver

 The hepatitis c virus spreads when there is blood-to-blood contact
 It is estimated that up to 90% of individuals in developed countries are infected with chronic HCV infection through the use or sexual contact of untreated blood or blood products or drug needles
 The primary sources of HCV infection in developing countries are infected injection equipment and inadequate blood and blood products
 There has not been a single documented case of blood transfusion in the United States for more than a decade because the blood supply is tested with both EIA and PCR techniques

 Sexual activities and behaviors were initially identified as potential sources of the hepatitis c virus
 Recent studies question this route of transmission
 This transmission is currently considered rare for Hepatitis c infection
 The following are currently known modes of transmission
 There may be other forms of transmission that are still unknown

 The cdna clone was first isolated from the hepatitis c virus genome in 1989 but until 1992 reliable tests for the virus screen were not available
 Therefore, those who have come in contact with blood or blood products before the implementation of blood supply test for HCV, must have been infected with HCV virus
 Blood products include clotting factors, immunoglobulins, pathogens, platelets, and plasma
 In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the risk of HCV infection is only one unit of blood in the United States, per one lakh per unit

 Medical and dental personnel are the first responders, and military personnel accidentally exposed to blood can cause HCV infections from blood splatter on the eyes or wounds through accidental needles
 The use of universal precautions to avoid such accidental risks significantly reduces the risk of HCV

 Sexual transmission of HCV rarely occurs
 Studies show that the risk of sexual transmission among heterosexuals is much lower or rarer than single relationships
 The CDC does not recommend the use of condoms in single-term couples for a long time
 However, because of the high prevalence of hepatitis C, this small risk may translate into a non-trivial number of cases transmitted by sexual routes
 Vaginal penetrative sex is believed to have a low risk of transmission while sexual exposure to the anogenital mucosa, with a high degree of mental damage, has a high risk of transmission

 Personal care items such as razors, toothbrushes, cuticle scissors, and other manicuring or pedicuring devices can easily cause blood contamination
 There is a risk of HCV when such things are shared
 In any such condition, when wounds such as canker, winter sores, and the condition in which the bleeding continues immediately after cleaning the teeth, proper care should be taken during therapy

 The transmission of the disease that is transmitted from the infected mother to the child during the process of birth is called vertical transmission
 Transmission of hepatitis c from mother to child has been well described, but is relatively rare
 Transmission occurs only in women who are HCV RNA positive at the time of delivery
 In this case, an estimated 6 out of 100 are at risk of transmission
 Women out of both HCV and HIV positive at the time of delivery have a risk of transmission of HCV in 25 out of 100

 "hepatitis C" is difficult to diagnose during its acute phase because most infected people do not experience any symptoms at this stage of the disease
 People who experience symptoms during the acute phase are so ill that they cannot even get treatment
 Diagnosing the stage of chronic hepatitis c is also very challenging because until the liver disease progresses, its symptoms are not revealed and it takes several decades

 Hepatitis c testing begins with a blood test for bloodborne diseases that is used to detect HCV
 anti-hcv antibodies can be detected within 15 weeks of infection in 80% of patients, in> 90% after 5 months and in> 97% of patients after 6 months
 Overall, HCV antibody testing has a strong positive predictive value for immunity to hepatitis c virus, but patients who have not yet developed immunity or have insufficient levels of immunity may miss it
 Sometimes people with hcv-infected people do not develop antibodies to fight the virus
 That is why they do not bring positive tests in HCV antibody screening
 Because of this possibility, RNA testing should be considered when the immunological test is negative but the risk of hepatitis is high

 Genotype testing is generally recommended in people suffering from HCV infection
 HCV genotype testing is used to determine the long-term and potential response to interferon-based treatment

 Current treatment consists of pegylated interferon-alpha 2a or pegylated interferon-alpha-2b and the anti-viral drug ribavirin for 24 to 48 weeks, depending on the genotype of the hepatitis c virus
 In a large multicenter, out of the broadly genotype 2 or 3 infected patients, patients who were being monitored and treated for 12 weeks, 1000 IU / ml on the seventh day
 Had obtained less HCV RNA than the patients being treated for more than 24 weeks

 In genotype 1 hepatitis c treated with ribavirin with pegylated interferon alpha-2a or pegylated interferon alpha-2b, human interferon lambada3, a signaling of genetic polymorphisms near human il28b gene, has significant differences in response to treatment Are connected
 This finding, informed in its original nature, has shown that patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C, possessing certain genetic variant alleles possessing the IL28B gene, are more capable than others in achieving sustained viral response after treatment
 Nature reports have demonstrated that the same genetic variation is also associated with natural acceptance of the genotype 1 hepatitis c virus

 In a mother who is also infected with HIV, the rate of transmission can be more than 19%
 At present, there is no data to determine whether antiviral therapy can reduce perinatal transmission
 Interferon and ribavirin are prescribed during pregnancy
 However, after the rupture of the membranes, skull skins can be lethally illuminated and prolonged labor can reduce the risk of transmission to the baby

 Many alternative therapies are aimed at streamlining liver function rather than treating the virus, thereby slowing the pace of the disease to maintain quality of life
 As an example, the extracts of Silybum marianum and Sho-psycho-toe are sold for their hcv-related effects, with the first being said to aid some liver functions and the second to aid liver health and the virus

 Some studies have reported that standard treatment by interferon and ribavirin leads to greater success when the antiviral drug amantadine is also given
 Sometimes it is also called "triple therapy"
 This includes a dose of 100 mg of amantadine twice a day
 Studies suggest that this may prove particularly useful for "unresponsive" patients who previously had no benefit from treatment with only interferon and ribavirin
 Amantidine is not approved for
 Now studies are trying to find out when it can benefit the patient in the event of liver damage and when it can cause harm

 khuli arthvyavastha arthvyavastha kaa ek darshan he
 If we understand the open economy by its literal meaning, then it means a country or society where anyone is allowed to do business with anyone and not that there is no government control or control over this trade
 par sarkaar aisi nitiyaan banaati he jisase aam log udyog or anya prakaar ke vyapaar aasaani se shuru kar saken
 In such an economy, businesses are allowed to flourish independently
 sarkari niyantran aise banaaye jaate he jinamein vyapaaron ko kisi bhi prakaar kii beyimaani se to roka jaataa he par niyantran ko itnaa bhi kadaa nahi kiya jaataa he ki imaandar vyapaar me asuvidha ho
 Open economy is not only for the internal trade of that society or country, but also external trade is seen from the same point of view
 khuli arthvyavastha kaa vichaar bharat me koi nayaa nahi he
 On reading the history carefully, it is known that India had a policy of open economy for trade from the beginning
 chandragupta maury ke samay me bharat me china se or europe se vyapaar ke bare main pataa chalata he
 The silk route is an example of India's contribution to international trade
 chanrdragupta maury or samraat ashok ke samay me kasht kaa vyapaar hota tha
 Trade flourished in India at the time of Akbar
 angrez bhi bharat me vyapaar karne aaye the
 That means in 1700-1800, there was trade in India with traders of foreign origin
 sambhavtah east india company ke vyapaariyon se saashak banane se bhartiya samaaj main vyapaar ko le ke ek aisi dharna ban gayi ki baad me 1947 me bharat ke azaad hone pe bharat me khuli arthvyavastha kaa saport zyaada netaaon ne nahi kiya
 India's first Prime Minister Pt
 Nehru was strongly influenced by Russian socialism
 azaadi ke baad nehru ke bharat me samaajwaad kii sthapana karne kaa praytn kiya
 Perhaps this was the biggest mistake in the field of India's economy
 1947 se 1990 tak bharat me khuli arthvyavastha nahi thi
 India imposed various taxes on imports and exports
 niryaat pe hone vale karon kii vajah se bhartiya udyog yaha banaaya hua maal antar-rashtreey bazaar me sasta nahi bench pate the
 India lagged behind the failure of Indian industries to compete in the international market
 is dauraan japan, china, korea, taiwan jaise desho ne antar-rashtreey bazaar me apana dabdaba banaaya
 Imports in India were also heavily taxed
 is kaaran se videshi udyog bharat me apana saamaan bechney me dikkat kahsus karte the
 Due to being very expensive in India similar to those made abroad, more people could not buy in India
 jo taknic bharat ke baahar janm leti thi ve aasaani se bharat ke logon tak nahi pahunch paati thim
 On the one hand, the citizens of India were deprived of computers, modern clocks, modern telephones, cars, etc
 from 1947 to 1980's, on the other hand, Indian industries could not get the necessary technology
 antar-rashtreey tareeko or takneekon se apane utpaada na bana paane kii vajah se bharat ke kayi udyog jaise textyle, krishi, aviation, manyufaccharing, ityadi antar-rashtreey maanakon se peeche rah gayi
 India's growth rate was around 3
0% and it came to be known by the Hindu growth rate in the world
 bharat ke udyogon ke viksit naa ho paane kii vajah se bharat ke tamaam log garibi rekha se neeche rah gayi
 During this time, the basic infrastructure of India developed very slowly
 bharat kaa bijli, pani, sadke, soochna tantra ityaadi kaphi kharaab hota chalaa gaya
 Inflation went up due to very high inflation, but due to the sick condition of the industries, the income of the people could not increase at the rate of inflation
 bharat me san 1985 se belans ouf pement kii samsya shuru hui
 The balance of payment problem in India took a formidable situation during the rule of Chandrashekhar government in 1991 and India's already lean economy was hit
 bharat me videshi mudra kaa bhandar keval teen hafte ke aaayato ke baraabar rah gaya
 This was a very serious problem
 is dauraan samasya itni gambheer ho chuki thi ki bharat ke paas desh ko chalaane ke liye jaruri dhan khatam ho gaya tha
 The Government of India had started preparations to mortgage the gold bank of England with its gold treasury
 nursimha raao ke netratv vaali bhartiya sarkaar ne bharat me bade paimaane me aarthik sudhaar karne k fisla kiya
 Manmohan Singh was the architect of these reforms called liberalization
 manmohan singh ne aane vaale samay me bharat kii arthniti ko puri tarah se badalne kii shuruyaat kii
 This was the time when India began to open up its economy
 zyaadaatar logon ke najariye se 1990 se abak kiye gayi aarthik sudhaaron ne hi bharat ko duniya main ek shashakt aarthik desh kaa darza dilaayaa
 Manmohan Singh was the Finance Minister of India from 1990 to 1996

 In 2004, Manmohan Singh, the author of Modern India's Economy, became the Prime Minister of India and P

 The economy underwent radical changes and India started making its place in the world economy
 khuli arthvyavastha kaa sabase bada fayda he azaadi
 To trade freely, to progress, to earn money
 chuki khuli arthvyavastha mul rup se udyogon or vyapaar ko badhaava detii he, to aise samaaj me nagarikon ko ek hi utpaada kharigadne ke kai vikalp hote he
 In such a situation, every industry has a natural pressure to make their products better and cheaper
 isse udyog nayi se nayi taknic kaa istemaal karte he
 As such the quality of the products is better
 chuki aisi arthvyavastha me udyogon ko badhaava diya jaataa he to zyaada se zyaada kaarkhane or daftar khulte he
 It gives people more means of employment
 bazaar me hone vaali pratistapardha kaa sabko fayda hota he
 New products are made
 puraane utpaadon kii gunvattta behtar banati he
 People get employment
 udyogon pe karmchaariyon kii maang badhne se isme bhi pratispardhaa panpti he
 And all industries prevent their workers from going into the company against paying more wages
 aisa hone se logo kii parchezing power babbti he
 People have better living conditions due to more money coming to them
 ve bade ghar me rah sakate he
 They can send their children to school better and can bear their family and social responsibilities very well
 khuli arthvyavastha me bahut sari chizon pe se sarkaar kaa niyantran kam hota he
 It is also called privatization
 maslan ab kaaphi vyapaar pe bank or anya vittiya sansthaanon kii nazar hoti he
 When a financial institution invests capital in an industry, it is obliged to see that this industry works with the thik
 vittiya santhaan ye bhi dekhta he ke udyog aisa kuch naa kare jisse ki usape kisi tarah kaa legal problem ho
 In the open economy, the market is itself the worker that people need
 agar koi utpaada yaa seva aisi he jisaki logon ko zarurat he to puraane udyogpati yaa koi nayaa antraprenyur us tarah ke utpaada yaa seva ko logo tak pahunchane lagta he
 After all, it is the benefit of both producers and occupants
 agar koi utpaada yaa seva aisi he jisaki logon ko ab zarurat nahi he to vah dhire dhire band ho jaati he
 If people do not buy, then the company will incur losses and it will either change its product over time or stop making it
 khuli arthvyavastha se nayi takneekon kaa vikaas hota he
 The competition in the market is bound to force the industries to develop new technologies
 1990 ke baad se bharat me kaaphi saare udyogon kaa tezi se vikaas hua he
 From the point of view of most people, the economic reforms carried out from 1990 till now gave India the status of a strong economic country in the world
 vibhinn udyogon kaa bharat main vikaas abhootpurv he

 Her upbringing, under the overall supervision of her mother, who was separated from the household related work of the Nehru family due to her illness, developed a strong personality in Indira along with strong protective tendencies

 "during the struggle between Mrs
 Gandhi and her rivals, the central Congress leadership for succession after 1965, many states and state congress organizations were forced to remove upper-caste leaders and replace the backward castes to collect votes of those castes
 So that their opposition and opponents in the state Congress can be defeated
 , Some of which may be considered appropriate socially progressive achievements, however, often lead to intensifying inter-ethnic regional conflicts

 Although the army warned that the Pakistani subalterns had reached very close pace to the city, they rejected their proposal to resettle in Jammu or Delhi and instead circled the local government and welcomed the media's attention

 This step had alienated India from the first world and Prime Minister Gandhi has now rapidly given a new direction to a pre-cautious national security and foreign policy

 However, Gandhi was now a national nuclear program in view of the nuclear threat from the People's Republic of China and the interest in the interference of two major superpowers not felt conducive to India's stability and security
 unhone naye pakistani raashtrapati zulfikaar ali bhutto ko ek saptaah tak chalanevaali shimla shikhar vaarta main aamantrit kiya tha
 Approaching the failure of the talks, the two heads of state eventually signed the Simla Agreement, under which the two countries contracted to negotiate and peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute

 In the early 1960s, the organized Green Revolution was the informal name for the intensive agriculture district program, under which the people of the cities, on whose support Gandhi was, in fact, deeply dependent on all Indian politicians, abound Cheap grain was guaranteed
 yah kaarykram chaar charnon par aadhaarit tha: This program, which lasted for ten years, eventually led to a threefold increase in wheat production and a small but attractive increase in rice; While there was little or no growth in cereals such as barley, gram and coarse cereals - still a relatively stable yield remained in these areas

 The internal structure of the Congress Party, weakened as a result of its numerous divisions, became entirely dependent on his leadership in determining the fate of elections
 gandhi kaa san 1971 kii taiyaari main naare kaa vishay tha garibi hataao
 This slogan and the blueprint of the proposed Poverty Hatao program, which came with it, were designed to give Gandhi an independent national support based on the rural and urban poor
 is tarah unhen pramukh gramin jatiyon ke dabadabe main rahe rajya or sthaneey sarkaron evam shahari vyapaaree varg ko andekha karne kii anumati rahi thi
 And, the share of the poor who remained unimpressed in the past, at least both the political value and the political weight, increased

 "these programs also presented the central political leadership the ownership of distributing new and vast resources throughout the country 


" "ultimately, Poor Hatao Poor was of little use: only 4% of all funds allocated for economic development, three The major went for poverty removal programs and almost none reached the "poorest of the poor" class
 is tarah yadhyapi yah kaarykram garibi ghataane main asafal rahi, isane gandhi ko chunaav jitaneka lakshya hasil kar liya
 Gandhi had already been accused of authoritarian conduct
 unki majboot sansadeey bahumat kaa vyavhaar kar, unki sattarudh bhartiya rashtriya congress ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar kendra or rajyon ke bich ke satta santulan ko badal diya tha
 He twice declared states ruled by opposition parties as "lawless and chaotic" and took control of them by imposing President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution
 iske alaava,sanjay gandhi, jo nirvaachit adhikariyon kii jagah par gandhi ke kareebi rajnatik salaahkaar bane the, ke badhate prabhaav par, pi

 Seeing his new inclination towards the use of authoritarian power, eminent personalities and ex-freedom fighters like Jayaprakash Narayan, Satendra Narayan Sinha and Acharya Jivataram Kripalani toured all over India campaigning actively against him and his government

 Thus the court ordered a ban against him from leaving the seat of parliament and participating in elections for six years

 Thus, this decision effectively freed him from office

 Gandhi called elections in 1977 to give voters another chance to approve that rule

 This arrest meant that Indira was automatically expelled from Parliament

 His arrest and long-running trial earned him sympathy from many people who had been afraid to consider him a dictator just two years earlier

 According to his description, these mountains looked impenetrable

 Wherever Buchanan went, he found the behavior of the residents hostile
 ve log company ke adhikariyon ke prati ashankit the or unase baatcheet karne ko taiyaar nahin the
 In many instances, they had left their homes and villages and fled
 ye pahari log koun the? ve bukanan ke daure ke prati itane ashankit kyon the? bukanan kii patrika main hamen unnisvin shatabdi ke praarambhik varshon main in logon kii jo taras khaane vaali haalat thi uski jhalak milti he
 He had written a diary about the places, places where he had visited, met people and observed their customs
 atharahavin shatabdi ke parvarti dashakon ke rajasav abhilekhon par drushtipaat karen to pataa lagata he ki in pahari logon ko 'pahadiya' kyon kaha jaataa tha
 They used to live around the palace hills
 ve jangal kii upaj se apni guzar-basar karte the or jhum kheti kiya karte the
 They used to clean the land by cutting bushes and burning weeds in a small part of the forest, and they grew from the potash of ashes ?? These hill people used to grow different types of pulses and jowar-millet for their food
 ve apane kudaal se jameen ko thodaa khurch lete the kuch varsho tak us saaf kii gai jameen main kheti karte the aarai fir use kuch varsho ke liye parati chhod kar nae ilaake main chale jate the jisase ki us jameen main khoi hui urvartaa fir se utpann ho jaati thi
 From those forests, Pahariyas used to gather flowers of Mahua for food, silk koya for sale and wood to make resin and Kathkoya
 pedo ke neeche jo chote-chote paudho ug aate the yaa parati jameen par jo ghaas-foos kii hari chadar-si bich jaati thi vah pashuon ke liye charaagaah ban jaati thi
 The lives of Pahariyas were closely associated with the forest as hunters, jhoom cultivators, food gatherers, kathakoya builders, silkworm rearers
 ve imali ke pedo ke bich bani apni jhopadiyon main rahete the or aam ke pedo kii chhaanh main aaraam karte the
 They considered the entire state as their private land and this land was the basis of their identity and life
 ve bahari logon ke pravesh kaa pratirodh karte the
 Their chiefs maintained unity in their group, settled mutual fighting and led their tribes when fighting with other tribes and plains
 in pahadiyon ko apana muladhar banaakar, pahadiya log baraabar un maidaanon par akraman karte rahete the jahaan kisaan ek sthaan par bas kar apni kheti-baadi kiya karte the
 These invasions by the hills were mostly done to keep themselves alive, especially in years of scarcity or famine
 saath hi, ye hamale maidaanon main based hue samudaayon par apni takat dikhalaane kaa bhi ek tarika tha
 Apart from this, such attacks were also done to build their political relations with outsiders
 maidaanon main rahane vaale jameendaaron ko akasar in pahari mukhiyaaon ko niyamit rup se kharad dekar unase shanti kharidni padati thi
 Similarly, merchant people also used to pay some toll to get permission to use the paths controlled by these hills
 jab aisa pathakar pahadiya mukhiyaaon ko mil jaataa tha to ve vyapaariyon kii raksha karte the or yah bhi aashwaasan dete the ki koi bhi unke maal ko nahin luutegaa
 Thus the peace treaty with some levies did not last long
 yah atharahavin shatabdi ke antim dashakon main us samay bhang ho gai jab sthir kheti ke kshetra kii seemayen aakraamak reeti se purvi bharat main badhaai jane lageen
 The British encouraged the felling of forests and the zamindars and landlords converted the fallow land into paddy fields
 angrejon ke liye sthaayee kashi kaa vistaar aavashyak tha kyonki usase rajasav ke sronton main vruddhi ho sakati thi, niryaat ke liye fasal paidaa ho sakati thi or ek sthaayee, suvyavasthit samaaj kii sthapana ho sakati thi
 They considered the forests to be desolate and considered the forest dwellers uncivilized, barbaric, rowdy and cruel over whom it was difficult to govern them
 isliye unhone yahi mahasoos kiya ki jangalon kaa safaaya karke, vahaan sthaayee kashi sthapit kerani hogi or junglee logon ko paaltu va sabhy bananaa hoga unase shikaar kaa kaam chhudvaana hoga or kheti kaa dhandha apnaane ke liye unhen raji karnaa hoga
 As permanent agriculture expanded, the area of forests and pastures became narrower
 isse pahari logon tathaa sthaayee khetiharon ke bich jhagada tej ho gaya
 The hill people started attacking the villages inhabited more regularly and snatched food grains and animals from the villagers
 aupniveshik adhikariyon ne uttejit hokar in pahadiyon par kaabo kii bharsak koshishen kin parantu unke liye aisa karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 In the 1770s, the British authorities adopted a brutal policy of clearing these hills and hunting and killing them
 tadoparaant, 1780 ke dashak main bhagalpur ke colector augustus cleveland ne shanti sthapana kii niti prastaavit kii jiske anusaar pahadiya mukhiyaaon ko ek vaarshik bhatta diya janaa tha or badale main unhen apane aadamiyon kaa chaal-chalan thik rakhane kii jimmedaari leni thi
 They were also expected to maintain order in their settlements and discipline their people
 lekin bahut se pahadiya mukhiyaaon ne bhatta lene se manaa kar diya
 Most of those who accepted it lost their power in their community
 aupniveshik sarkaar ke vetanbhogi ban jane se unhen adhinsth karmchaaree yaa vaitanaik mukhiya mana jane laga
 While the campaigns for peace-making were going on, the Pahadias went to the inner parts of the mountains to protect themselves from hostile forces and to keep fighting with outsiders
 isliye jab 1810-11 kii sardiyon main bukanan ne is kshetra kii yatra kii thi to yah swaabhaavik hi tha ki pahadiya log bukanan ko andeh or avishvaas kii drushti se dekhte
 The experience of peacekeeping campaigns and the memories of brutal repression created a perception in his mind about the effect of infiltration of British people in his area, it seemed to him that every white man was representing such power
 Who are striving to destroy their life style and means of survival by snatching their forest and land from them
 vastut: inhen dinon unhen ek nae khatre kii suchnaayen milane lagi thim or vah tha santhal logon kaa aagaman
 Santhals were entering the area in large numbers, clearing the forests there, cutting timber, plowing land and growing rice and cotton
 chunki santhal bashindon ne nichali pahadiyon par apana kabja jamaa liya tha, isliye pahadiyon ko rajmahal kii pahadiyon main or bheetar kii ore peeche hatana padaa
 The Pahadia people used the hoe for their jhoom cultivation, so if the hoe is considered a symbol of Pahariya life, the plow has to be considered representative of the power of the new settlers
 hal or kudaal ke bich kii yah ladaai bahut lambii chali
 Towards the end of 1810, Buchanan crossed the Ganjuria mountain, a part of the Rajmahal ranges, and passed through the middle of the Chattani region to a village
 vaise to yah ek purana gaanv tha par uske aas-paas kii jameen kheti karne ke liye abhi-abhi saaf kii gai thi
 Seeing the land there, he came to know that the work of that area has been reversed 'with proper use of human labor'
 usne likhaa, ganjuriya main abhi-abhi kaafii jutai kii gai he jisase yah pataa chalata he ki ise kitne shandaar ilaake badla ja saktaa he main sochataa hoon, isaki sundarataa or samrudh vishwa ke kisi bhi kshetra jaisi viksit kii ja sakati he
 The land here is quite flat but very fine and Buchanan did not see such good tobacco and mustard anywhere else
 poochne par use pataa chalaa ki vahaan santhalon ne kashi kshetra kii seemayen kaafii badha lee thi
 They came to this area around 1800
 They drove the hill people living there on the lower slopes, wiped out the forests and then settled there
 santhal 1780 ke dashak ke aas-paas bengal main aane lage the
 The zamindars hired them to prepare new lands for farming and to expand farming and the British authorities invited them to settle in the jungle palaces
 jab british log pahadiyon ko apane bas main karke sthaayee kashi ke liye ek sthaan par basaane main asafal rahe to unka dhyaan santhalon kii ore gaya
 The Pahadia people were not ready to hand the plow to cut the forest and still behaved unruly
 jabaki, iske vipareet, santhal adarsh bascindia prathit hue, kyonki unhen jangalon kaa safaaya karne main koi hichak nahin thi or ve bhoomi ko puri takat lagaakar jotate the
 Santhals were given land and ready to settle in the foothills of the palace
 1832 tak, jameen ke ek kaafii bade ilaako ko damin-i-koh ke rup main simaankit kar diya gaya
 This was declared to be Santhal land
 unhen is ilaake ke bheetar rahanaa tha, hal chalaakar kheti kerani thi or sthaayee kisaan bananaa tha
 The grant letter of the land given to the Santhals had the condition that they had to be plowed within the first ten years by clearing at least one tenth of the land given to them
 is puure kshetra kaa surveykshan karke uskaa nakshaa taiyaar kiya gaya
 Its boundary was fixed by burying the pillars around it and it was separated from the world of the permanent peasants of the plains and from the hills of the Pahadia people
 damin-i-koh ke simakan ke baad, santhalon kii bastiyaan badi teji se badhin, santhalon ke gaanvon kii sankhya jo 1838 main 40 thi, teji se badhkar 1851 tak 1,473 tak pahunch gai
 In the same period, the population of Santhals which was only 3,000 increased to more than 82,000
 jaise-jaise kheti kaa vistaar hota gaya, vaise-vaise company kii tijoriyon main rajasav raashi main vruddhi hoti gai
 The long history of his travels is repeatedly mentioned in nineteenth-century Santhal songs and myths: he states that the Santhal people used to keep walking tirelessly in search of a place to settle for themselves
 ab yahan damin-i-koh main aakar maano unki is yatra ko purna viraam lag gaya
 When the Santhals settled on the palace hills, the hill people first resisted it, but eventually they were forced to move inward into these hills
 unhen nichali pahadiyon tathaa ghaatiyon main neeche kii ore aane se roak diya gaya or i pari pahadiyon ke chattani or adhik banjar ilaakon tathaa bhitari shushk bhaagon tak simit kar diya gaya
 This had a bad effect on their living and life and later they became poor
 jhum kheti nayi-se-nayi jaminen khojane or bhoomi kii practik urvartaa kaa upyog karne kii kshamta par nirbhar rahati he
 The most fertile lands now became scarce for them as they had now become part of Damin
 isliye pahadiya log kheti ke apane tareeke ;jhum kheti ko aage safaltaapurvak nahin chalaa sake
 Pahariya hunters also faced problems when the forests of the region were cleared for cultivation
 iske vipareet santhal logon ne apni pehle vaali khanbdosh zindagi ko chhod diya tha
 Now they had settled in one place and started cultivating many commercial crops for the market and dealing with merchants and moneylenders
 kintu, santhalon ne bhi jaldi hi yah samaj liya ki unhone jis bhoomi par kheti kerani shuru kii thi vah unke haathon se nikalati ja rahi he
 The government cleared the land on which the Santhals started farming; the state was levying a heavy tax, the moneylender; the Diku were charging a very high rate of interest and occupying the land only in the event of non-payment of loans
 And the zamindars were claiming their control over the Damin area
 1850 ke dashak tak, santhal log yah mahasoos karne lage the ki apane liye ek adarsh sansar kaa nirmaan karne ke liye, jahaan unka apana shashan ho, jameendaaron, sahukaaron or aupniveshik raaj ke viruddh vidroh karne kaa samay ab aa gaya he
 The Santhal Parganas were constructed after the Santhal Rebellion of 1855–56, for which an area of 5,500 sq mi was taken from the districts of Bhagalpur and Birbhum
 aupniveshik raaj ko aashaa thi ki santhalon ke liye nayaa pargana banane or usamen kuch vishesh kanoon lagu karne se santhal log santusht ho jaayenge
 He was an employee of the British East India Company
 uski yatraayen keval bhudrushyon ke pyaar or agyaat kii khoj se hi prerit nahin thim
 He used to travel everywhere with a large team of map navis, surveyors, porters who carried the sedan etc

 The Franks were a race settling in Western Europe and speaking a West Germanic language
 teesri sadi isvi main inke qabeele rin nadi ke uttarpurvi bhaag main rahete the
 At that time this entire region was under the occupation of the Roman Empire and they used to have skirmishes among themselves
 ek salia naamak franki upashakha kii romanon ke saath mitrataa thi or unka apana rajya tha
 When the Roman Empire sunset, around the fifth century AD, a monarchy of the Salian Franks called Merovinzi quickly dominated much of modern France and began their kingdom
 samay ke saath-saath frank shabd kaa koi vishesh jaateey arth nahin rah gaya, lekin inhi frinkon kii vajah se hi "frans" kaa naam "frans" padaa tha
 For people living in the Middle East, all the people of Western Europe got the name Frank
 dhire-dhire yahi shabd hindi main bhi pravesh kar gaya, jis vajah se bhartiya upmahadweep main europe ke logon ko "firanki" yaa "firangi" bulaayaa jane laga
 The Arabic language still calls Europe "firanja"
 anya jatiyon kii tarah, frankon ne bhi apni jaateey utpatti ke bare main kuch mithyaayein banaai jinhen sach nahin mana ja saktaa
 According to the "liber Histório Francorum" written in 727, after the defeat of Troy in the territory of ancient Greece, about 12,000 Trojans migrated from there to northern Europe, and the Franks began their origin
 isi kahani kaa ek rup "fredegaar kaa varnan" main miltaa he, jiske anusaar is samooh main kabhi ek frankiyo naam kaa raja hua, jisapar is jati kaa naam frank padaa
 We find similar stories in other civilizations too - like Rome was named after a king named Romulus and India was named after a king named Bharata
 "tabula peutingeriana" naamak roman varnan main likhaa he ke lagbhag san 50 isvi main franko kaa ek chamaavi naam kaa qabeela rin nadi ko paar kar ke roman ilaake main daakhil ho gaya
 This is the first reference to Franks in history
 samay ke saath-saath roman samrajya kamazor hota gaya or franki qabeele avasar paakar alag-alag kshetron par dhaava bolte rahete the
 In 250, a Frankie squad marched through Roman territory and reached Spain and there was uproar
 roman sena ko unhen hataane main lagbhag das varsh lage
 In 357 AD, a king of the Frances' Salia subdivision came and settled on Roman-controlled soil
 agle saal hi, roman samrajya ne sarkari str par unhen apana sandhi-mitra maan liya
 By the fifth century, many small Franky states had been formed
 clovis pratham naam ke franki raja ne in sab ko jeet liya or saare 509 main franko kaa raja ban gaya
 His grandfather's name was Merowetch and from this he was named Merowinji
 clovis kii patni isaai thi or clovis ne uskaa dharm apana liya, jis se frankiyon kaa isaikaran shuru ho gaya
 Clovis had four sons and divided his kingdom among them
 aage chalakar un putron ne bhi apane putron main apane rajya baante
 In all these brothers, dragging erupted, causing the Merovinji Rajkula to become fragmented
 san 613 main, clothar dwitiya ne phir se frankiyon ko ekatrit kiya or uske putr dagobart pratham ne bhi sainya safaltaayen pai
 But the later kings of Dagobart were weak
 687 main lade gaye tartri ke yuddh ke baad to yah naubat aa gayi ke rajya vastav main raja ke mahal kaa sevapramukh chalaa rahaa tha
 These chiefs started working like kings
 737-743 ke kaal main sevapramukh sharl martel naam kaa ek vyakti tha
 Spain was ruled by Muslim rule at that time and they were trying to take over France
 732 main sharl martel ne tuur ke yuddh main muslim sena ko haraakar khyaati praapt kii
 His son named Paypen abolished the Merowinji Raj in 751 and declared himself king
 is nae rajkul ko karolingi kaha jaataa he
 The most famous emperor of this clan was Charlemagne
 usne apane samrajya kaa naam "pavitra roman samrajya" rakhaa
 It had nothing to do with the Roman Empire
 usne keval apane aap ko vishaal pracheen roman samrajya kaa vaaris jatalane ke liye aisa kiya
 Later, two of Charlemagne's grandsons fought a civil war, which eventually resulted in the Franky Empire being divided into two parts: western Francaia and eastern Francaia
 in donon rajyon main simavarti kshetron ke liye ladaaiyaan hoti raheen
 The Frankie identity disappeared over time, but French and German identities took the form of two different nations and cultures
 pashchimi frankia ke frank vahaan kii sthai gallo-roman jatiyon main samaa gaye or unki bhashaa samay ke saath franki bhashaa se bhinn latini kii vanshaj francisi bhashaa ban gai
 Some historians consider the battles between France and Germany on their border areas in the First World War and World War II to be modern links in connection with the dragging of this eastern and western Francia

 Archimedes died c 212 BC The Second Punic War took place when Roman armies led by General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year siege
 plutark ke dwaara die gaye lokapriy vivaran ke anusaar, archimedes ek ganitiya chitra par vichaar kar rahe the, jab shahar par kabza kiya gaya
 a Roman soldier ordered him to come and meet General Marcellus, but he refused, saying that he had to complete work on his problem
 isse sainik naaraaz ho gaya or usne apni talwaar se archimedes ko maar daalaa
 Plutarch also gives an account of the death of Archimedes, less-known, stating that he was probably killed when he was attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier
 is kahani ke anusaar, archimedes ganitiya upkaran le ja rahe the or unhen isliye maar diya gaya kyonki sainik ne sochaa ki ye keemtee saamaan he
 General Marcellus is said to have been greatly enraged by Archimedes' death, as he considered him an invaluable scientific asset and ordered that Archimedes should not be harmed in any way
 mana jaataa he ki archimedes ke antim shabd the, "mere vruton ko pareshaan mat karo ", yahaan vruton kaa sandarbh us ganitiya chitra ke vruton se he jise archimedes us samay adhyayan kar rahe the jab roman sainik ne unhen pareshaan kiya
 These words are often described in Latin as "noli turbare circulos meos", but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they are not found in the description given by Plutarch

 The most widely known fact about Archimedes is how he discovered a method for determining the volume of an object of an irregular shape
 vitruvius ke anusaar, raja hero II ke liye ek lorel vreth ke aakaar kaa ek nayaa mukut banaaya gaya tha or archimedes se yah pataa lagane ke liye kaha gaya ki yah mukut shuddh sone se bana he yaa beyimaan sunar ne isamen chaandi milaayi he
 Archimedes had to solve this problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it into a regular-sized object to calculate its density
 nahaate samay, unhone dekha ki jab ve tub ke andar gaye, tub main pani kaa str upar uth gaya or unhone mahasoos kiya ki is prabhaav kaa upyog mukut ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Water cannot be compressed for practical purposes, so the submerged crown will replace its volume with equal amounts of water
 mukut ke bhaar ko pratisthapit pani ke aaytan se vibhajit karke, mukut kaa ghanatv praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If cheap and low density metals are added to it, then its density will be less than gold
 phir kya tha, archimedes apni is khoj se itane zyada uttejit ho gaye ki ve kapadey pahananaa hi bhul gaye or nagn avasthaa main galiyon main bhaagate hue chillane lage "ureka !" The story of the gold crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes
 iske alaava, pani ke visthaapan ke maapan main aavashyak sateekta kii atyadhik maatra ke kaaran, iske dwaara varnit vidhi kii vyavhaarikta par sawaal uthaaye gaye hai
 Perhaps Archimedes gave a solution that applied to a theory called Archimedes' theory in hydrology, which he describes in one of his texts on floating bodies
 is siddhant ke anusaar ek taral main dubi hui vastu par ek utplavan bal lagata he jo iske dwaara hathaaye gaye taral ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the gold crown with solid gold, for which the crown would have been first balanced on a scale with a sample of gold, then the mechanism would have been immersed in water
 
 yadi mukut sone se kam ghanaa tha, isane apane adhik aaytan ke kaaran adhik pani ko pratisthapit kiya hoga or is prakaar is par lagane vaale utplavan bal kii maatra namoonay se adhik rahi hogi
 This difference in buoyancy may have been seen on the scale

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Black hole ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In general relativity, a black hole or a black hole or a Krishna vivar is such an astronomical object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing can escape the light, including the stretch
 kalenidr ke chaaron ore ghatana kshitij naamak ek seemaa hoti he jisamen vastuen gir to sakati hai parantu baahar kuch nahin aa saktaa
 It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light falling on it and does not reflect anything
 yah ooshmaagatiki main thik ek adarsh krishnika kii tarah he
 Quantum analysis of the black hole shows that they contain temperature and Hawking radiation
 apane adrishy bhitari bhaag ke baavjood, ek kalachhidr anya padaarthon ke saath antah-kriya ke madhyam se apni upasthiti prakat kar saktaa he
 For example, black holes can be detected by the motion of a group of stars orbiting a part of the space that appears empty
 vaikalpik rup se, ek saathi taare dwaara aap apekshaakrit chote kalenidr main gas giraate hue dekh sakate hai
 This gas spirals inwards, heating up to very high temperatures and emits large amounts of radiation that can be detected by telescopes located on Earth or orbiting the Earth
 is tarah ke avlokanon ke parinaam swaroop yah vaigyanik sarv-sammati ubhar kar saamne ai he ki, unke swayan na dikhne ke baavjood, hamaare brahmad main kalenidr astitv rakhte he
 By these methods, scientists have discovered that a radio source called Dhanu a *, located in the center of our galaxy, Kshirmarg, has a giant black hole whose mass is 43 million times the mass of our sun
 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km
 m Radius of the earth and 9 mm of the earth It can turn into black hole when inside
 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr kaa dravyaman kisi gurutveey apurvata) par kendrit rah saktaa he, yah ek bindu, ek challa, ek prakaash kiran, yaa ek sphier ho saktaa he; vartmaan main iske vishay main thik thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly
 haalaanki, aasapaas ke paryaavaran par uske guruttviya prabhaav dwaara uski upasthiti kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, khaas kar microkvasar or sakriya gallexic nabhikon dwaara, jahaan paas ke kalenidr main girane vaale padaarth ati garam ho jate hai or eks-re vikiran kii badi maatra chhodte hai
 This observation method enables astronomers to ascertain their existence
 kalenidr ekmaatr aise padaarth hai jo in paimaanon par khare utarate hai or saamaanya saapekshata ke dhaanche ke anuroop hote hai
 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are visible from outside the black hole
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
 ek baar koi kan ghatana kshitij ke andar aa jaye, uskaa blike hole ke bheetar janaa avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 For a spectator standing far away, the clocks near the black hole would seem to move more slowly
 is prabhaav ke kaaran, dur khadaa darshak yah dekhegaa ki blike hole main girane vaali koi vastu uske ghatana kshitij ke nikat aane par dhimi ho jaati he, us tak pahunchne ke liye anant samay leti hui prathit hoti he
 At the same time all the actions of this object slow down, resulting in the light appearing more red and dim, this effect is called gravitational red shift
 ant main, girane vaali vastu itani maddham ho jaati he ki dikhaai dena band ho jaati he, ek bindu par ghatana kshitij par pahunchne se thik pehle
 The Schwarzschild radius limits non-spherical event horizons for non-rotating black holes
 ek vastu kii schvarjaschild trigya dravyaman ke anupaat main hoti he
 Circled black holes have a distorted, nonspherical event horizon
 chunki ghatana kshitij ek bhautik sataha nahin he balki keval ek ganitiya paribhaashit seemaa he, padaarth yaa vikiran ko blike hole main pravesh karne se rokane vaala kuch bhi nahin he, keval baahar nikalne se inako roka jaataa he
 The description given by general relativity for black holes is an approximation and it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important from near the event horizon
 yah, blike hole ke ghatana kshitij ke nikat padaarth ke prekshan ko, saamaanya saapekshata or uske prastaavit vistaaron ke adhyayan ko sambhav banaata he
 Although black holes themselves do not radiate energy, electromagnetic radiation and matter particles can radiate from outside the event horizon, via Hawking radiation
 singhulerity blike hole ke centre main hoti he, jahaan padaarth main dabane ke kaaran anant ghanatv ho jaataa he, gurutvkarshan khinchaav anant shaktishaalee hota he or antariksh-samay main anant vikruti hoti he
 This means the mass of a black hole is completely compressed into a region with zero volume
 blike hole ke centre main is shunya-aaytan, anant rup se saghan kshetra ko gurutveey singhulerity kaha jaataa he
 The singularity of a non-rotating black hole is zero in length, width, and height; The singularity of a rotating black hole is ring-shaped and is located on the plane of rotation
 challe main koi motaai nahin hoti isliye koi aaytan nahin hota
 The presence of singularity in general relativity is generally considered an indication of the principle not being applied
 haalaanki yah apekshit he; yah aisi paristhiti main ghatit hota he jahaan kwantum yantric prabhaavon ko inkaa varnan karnaa chahie tha, ati ucch ghanatv or kan sahabhaagitaaon ke kaaran
 Until now it has not been possible to combine the effects of quantum and gravity in one theory
 aam taur par ummid kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv ke siddhant main singulerity rahit blike hole honge
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness where the photons will be trapped in a circular orbit, moving along the tangent of the sphere
 anavarti blike hole ke liye, photone sphere kii trigya schvarjaschild trigya kii 1
5 guna hoti he
 These orbits are dynamically unstable, so any small disturbance will also grow larger over time and either throw it beyond the black hole or push it within the event horizon
 haalaanki prakaash abhi bhi photone sphere ke andar se batch saktaa he, koi prakaash jo andar kii or jaati prakshepan path se photone kshetra ko paar karti he us par blike hole kaa kabja ho jaayegaa
 Therefore any light that reaches an audience standing outside from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by an object outside the photon sphere but beyond the event horizon
 neutron taron jaisi anya compact vastuon main bhi photone sphere ho sakate hai
 This is based on the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, so an object that is smaller than 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius would actually have a photon sphere corresponding to the object's mass
 chakrit blike hole chaaron taraf se argosphior namak ek antariksh-samay kshetra se ghira hota he jisamen sthir khada hona asambhav he
 This is the result of a process called frame-dragging; General relativity predicts that any rotating mass will try to stretch the space-time around itself
 chakrit drabyaman ke paas kii koi bhi vastu chakra kii disha main ghoomana shuru kar degi
 For a rotating black hole, its impact becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction just to stand still
 ek blike hole kaa argosphior nimnlikhit se ghira hota he: Within the ergosphere, space-time is drawn at a greater speed than light - in general relativity physical objects are forbidden to move faster than light, but space-time zones allow them to be compared to other space-time regions i can walk faster than light
 vasteen or vikiran, centre main gire bina argosphior ke bheetar kaksha main rah sakati hai
 But they cannot hover, because this would require them to travel faster than light backwards, compared to their own space-time zone, which is moving faster than light compared to an outside viewer
 vasteen or vikiran bhi argosphior se batch kar nikal sakate hai
 In fact, the Penrose process predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the agosphere, for this they will gain energy by "stealing" some of the black hole's energy
 agar vastuon ke kul drabyaman kaa bada bhaag is tarah batch nikalataa he, blike hole kii ghoomane kii gati or dhimi pad jaayegi or antat shaayad ghoomana band bhi ho jaye | The fascinating image of the black hole is bound to raise the question of whether such bizarre objects actually exist, or are they merely imaginary solutions to the Einstein equations
 oinstin kii swayan kr yah galat dharna thi ki blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki patan kii ore agrasar kanon kii koniya gati unki chaal ko sthirataa pradaan karegi
 Because of this, the general relativity community continued to dismiss its opposing results for many years
 lekin unamem se kuch is vishwaas par kaayam rahe ki blike hole kaa astitv vastav main he, or 1960 ke dashak ke ant tak ve adhikansh shodhakartaaon ko yah vishwaas dilaane main safal rahe ki ghatana kshitij kaa nirmaan vaaki main sambhav he
 Once upon a time, Roger Penrose proved that there must be some form of syngularity within him
 iske kuch hi samay pashchaat, stephen hawking ne yah darshaya ki big baing ke kai brahmadia samaadhaanon main singulerity kaa astitv he, scaler kshetron or anya videshi padaarthon kii anupasthiti main 
 The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical characteristics of a black hole are simple and easily understandable, making them respected research subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki blike holon ke nirmaan kii praathmik prakriya taron jaisi baari vastuon kaa guruttviya patan rahi hogi, lekin kai anya prakriyaayein bhi hai jo blike hole ke nirmaan kii taraf le ja sakati hai
 Gravitational collapse occurs when the internal pressure of an object is insufficient to resist its own gravity
 taron main yah aamtaur par isliye hota he kyonki yaa to taron main apane taapmaana ko banaae rakhane ke liye "eendhan" aparyaapt he, yaa ek tara jo sthir tha use dher saare atirikt padaarth mili parantu uske crod kaa taapmaana nahin badhaa
 In both cases, star temperature would prove insufficient to prevent its collapse under its own weight
 is patan ko taare ke ghatakon ke aapjatya dabaav dwaara roka ja saktaa he, padaarth ek aakarshak ghani avasthaa main sanghanit ho jaataa he
 The result is a type of compact star
 What type of compact star will form will depend on the mass of the residue - the residuals have decimated the outer surfaces after the changes caused by the collapse
 note karen ki yah mul taare se kaaphi kam hoga- 5 se adhik saura drabyaman vaale avasheshon kaa utpaadan aise taron se hota he jinka dravyaman patan se pehle 20 se adhik rahaa hoga
 If the mass of the residue exceeds ~ 3-4 solar masses - because the original star was either too heavy or the residue has collected additional mass) - the neutron's inelastic pressure is also insufficient to prevent collapse
 iske baad aisi koi gyaat prakriya nahin he jo is patan ko roak sake or vastu patit ho kar blike hole main tabdeel ho jaayegi
 This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is attributed to the formation of most stellar mass black holes
 gurutveey patan ke liye bahut adhik ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the current age of the universe, this high density is found only in stars, but in the early universe the density was much higher soon after the Big Bang, which may have made the creation of black holes possible
 ucch ghanatv akele ek blike hole ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki drabyaman kaa samaan vitaran, drabyaman ko ikattha hone kii anumati nahin degaa
 For the formation of ancient black holes in this dense medium, it is necessary to have initial cubic disturbances that can later grow under the influence of their own gravity
 praarambhik brahmad ke vibhinn modelon main in gadbadiyon ke aakaar ke bare main vyapak matbhed he
 Various models predicted the creation of black holes, ranging from Planck masses to hundreds of thousands of solar masses
 atah aadim blike hole kisi bhi prakaar ke blike hole ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that can create a black hole
 siddhant rup main, blike hole kaa nirmaan ucch urja takkaron main bhi sambhav he jo paryaapt ghanatv paidaa karti hai
 However, so far, no such phenomenon has been detected, either directly or indirectly, as a lack of oscillating equilibrium in particle accelerator experiments
 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki blike hole ke dravyaman ke liye ek nichali seemaa honi chahie
