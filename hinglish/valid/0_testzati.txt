 On a progressively smaller scale, a similar concept applies, where unit landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive and subtraction processes
 aadhunik bhu-akruti vigyaan, kisi grah ke sataha par saamagree ke pravaah ke apsaran kaa adhyayan he or isliye talachat vigyaan ke saath nikat rup se sambhddha he, jise samaan rup se us pravaah ke abhisaran ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Geomorphic processes are influenced by tectonics, climate, ecology, and human activities, and equally many of these factors may be influenced by ongoing development on the Earth's surface, for example, through isostasis or mountain precipitation
 kai bhu-akruti vigyaani, bhu-akritik prakriyaaon kii madhyasthata vaale jalwaayu or vivartaniki ke bich pratipushti kii sambhaavna main vishesh ruchi lete hai
 Practical applications of geomorphology include crisis assessment including landslide forecasting and mitigation, river control and restoration, and coastal protection

 This section provides a brief outline of some of the major figures and events of their development
 bahujna chini vaigyanik or rajaneta shen kuo bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa ek siddhant khojane vaala shaayad sabase praarambhik vyakti tha
 It is based on his observation of a marine fossil shell in a geological layer of a mountain hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean
 jab usne chattan ke kataav khand kii taraf dwikpaati khol ko ek kshaitij vistaar main chalate dekha, to usne siddhant nikaala ki yah chattan kabhi praha-aitihaasik kaal ke samudri tat kaa sthaan thi jo kai sadiyon ke dauraan saikadon mile kii duuri par sthanantarit ho gaya
 He concluded that the land was reorganized differently due to soil erosion of the mountains and deposition of silt

 When mcgee used the term at the International Geological Conference of 1891, it became common usage in English, German and French
 ek aarambhik lokapriy bhu-akritik model bhugolic chakra yaa kataav kaa chakra tha jise 1884 or 1899 ke bich wiliam morris davis dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 This cycle was inspired by the principles of homogeneity that James Hutton first proposed
 ghati jaisi akritiyon ke sambandh main, ekarupathavaad ne is chakra ko aise anukram main chitrit kiya jisamen ek nadi kisi ghati ko adhik se adhik gaharaa katati he, lekin phir paksh ghaatiyon kaa kataav us ilaake ko antat punah samtal kar detaa he or oonchai ko kam kar detaa he, jiske baad utthan us chakra ko phir se shuru kar saktaa he
 Decades after Davis developed his theory, many studies of geomorphology attempted to fit his ideas into this mold for landscape development on a large scale, and are often referred to today as "davisian"
 davis ke vichaaron ko kaaphi had tak aaj paar kar liya gaya he, mukhya rup se unamem purvanumaan kshamta or gunatmak prakruti kii kami kii vajah se, lekin ve is vishay ke itihaas main ek atyant mahatvapurn vyakti bane hue hai
 In the 1920s, Walter Pank developed an alternative model to Davis's model, assuming that topographic evolution could be better defined as a balance between continuous processes of uplift and denudation, not Davis's single uplift
 As decay occurring after
 haalanki, apekshaakrit yuvavastha main hi uski asamyik mrityu kii vajah se, davis ke saath vivaad or unke kaaryon ke angreji anuwaad kii kami se unke vichaaron ko kai varshon tak vyapak manyata nahin mili
 These authors attempted to give the study of the evolution of the Earth's surface a more generalized, globally relevant basis than before
 19veen sadi ke aarmabhik kaal main, lekhakon ne - vishesh rup se europe main - bhu-akritiyon ke liye sthaneey jalwaayu ko shrey diya or vishesh rup se himachhadan or perigleshial prakriyaaon ko
 In contrast, Davis and Pank both attempted to emphasize the importance of landscape development over time and the generality of Earth's surface processes over different landscapes under different conditions
 jabaki penk or davis or unke anuyaayi mukhyatah pashchimi europe main lekhan or adhyayan kar rahe the, bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa ek anya, mote taur par pruthak skool 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main sanyukt rajya america main viksit hua
 Following the pioneering works of Grove Carl Gilbert in the early 20th century, a group of natural scientists, geologists and hydraulic engineers, including Ralph Elgar Bagnold, John Hack, Luna Leopold, Thomas Medoc, and Arthur Stroller, on elements of landscape shapes Started research such as river and hill slopes, for which they arranged, direct, outperformed their aspects Ratmk took measurements and investigating the scaling of these measurements

 Today, the field of geomorphology covers a very wide range of different perspectives and interests
 aadhunik shodhakarta maatraatmak "siddhant" nikaalane kaa prayaas karte hai jo prithvi kii sataha kii prakriyaaon ko niyantrit karte hai, lekin samaan rup se, ve prayek bhudrishy or vaataavaran kii vishistataa ko pahachaanate hai, jinamein ye prakriyaayein sanchalit hoti hai
 Particular important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include: aadhunik bhu-akruti vigyaan, paraspar sambandhit prakriyaaon ke maatraatmak vishleshan par kendrit he
 Modern advances in geochemistry, especially cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry and fission track dating, have enabled us to first measure the rates at which geomorphic processes occur on a geologically relevant timeline

 Weathering is the chemical and physical disintegration of Earth's material caused by contact with atmospheric or near surface agents
 sataha ke nazadik in parivartanon ke utpaadon ko baad main kataav ke vibhinn karkon dwaara dur le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The nature of the processes investigated by a geologist is strongly dependent on the landscape or topography involved in the investigation, and the interest of the time and length line
 haalanki, nimnlikhit gaiyr-vistrut suchi inamen se kuch ke saath jude bhudrishy tatwon kii ek jhalak pradaan karti he
 The primary surface processes responsible for most topographic forms include wind, wave, chemical dissolution, mass destruction, groundwater activity, surface water flow, ice action, tectonics, and volcanoes
 anya adhik gambhir bhu-akritik prakriyaaon main shaamil ho saktaa he perigleshial prakriyaayein, namak kii madhyasthata vaali kriya, yaa parloukik prabhaav
 Rivers and streams are not only carriers of water but also sediment
 pani, jab sataha par pravaahman rahata he, to vah talachhaton kaa istemaal karne main sakasham hota he or inhen neeche kii taraf baha le jaataa he, yaa to tal bhaar athwa prasupt bhaar ke rup main yaa phir vighatit bhaar ke rup main
 The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and the discharge of the river
 nadiyaan nae chattaanon kaa apradan karne or nae talachat banane main bhi sakasham hai, apane tal dwaara or aasapaas pahari dhalaanon ke saath yugman dwaara
 is tarah, nadiyon ko gaiyr-himandeey vaataavaran main bade paimaane ke bhudrishy ke liye aadhaar str kii sthapana karne ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Rivers are important sources of exposure to various landscape elements
 jab nadiyaan sthalakritiyon se hote hue pravaahit hoti hai, ve aam taur par aakaar main badi ho jaati hai or anya nadiyon ke saath mil jaati hai
 The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system and is often dendritic, but may also assume other forms depending on the underlying geology and local topography
 vaiudh prakriyaayein hawa kii gatividhi se sambandhit he or adhik vishisht rup se, prithvi kii sataha ko aakaar dene kii hava kii kshamta se

 Although water and large flows use more material than air in most environments, aeration processes are important in dry environments, deserts
 mitti, regolyth or pathar, gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke antargat rengte hue, ludhakte hue, behate hue, girte hue nichi kii taraf jate hai
 Such massive breakdowns occur on terrestrial and slopes and have been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Eeapetus
 pahaad ke dhalaanon par chal rahi prakriyaayein dhalaan ke sataha kii sansthiti ko badal sakati hai, jo badale main un prakriyaaon kii daron ko parivartit kar sakati he
 Slopes that deepen to a delicate state are able to quickly release large amounts of material, making the sloping process an important element of landscape in tectonically active areas
 prithvi par, jaivik prakriyaayein jaise ki khudaai yaa tree thro kuch dhalaani prakriyaaon kii daron ko nirdhaarit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Glaciers, which are geographically limited, are effective factors for landscape change
 ghati main neeche kii taraf dhire-dhire jate barf kii gatividhi neeche kii chattan kaa gharshan karti he or use ukhaad detii he
 Friction produces fine sediment, called glacial flour
 himand ke samaapt ho jane ke baad uske dwaara parivahan kiye gaye malbe ko moren kaha jaataa he
 Glacial erosion is attributed to U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys formed by the river
 himand kii prakriya jis tarah se anya bhudrishy tatwon ke saath sampark karti he, vishesh rup se dhalaani or nadi kii prakriyaaon ke saath, vah plio-plistosin bhudrishy vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he or uske talachat kai oonchi pahari ke vaataavaran main milte hai
 Environments that have been snow-capped relatively recently but are no longer can still show higher landscape change rates than landscapes that have never been snow-capped
 gaiyr-himand bhu-akritik prakriyaayein jinhen tis par bhi purv himachhadan dwaara anukulit kiya gaya he unhen parahimanad prakriyaayein kaha jaataa he
 This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by the formation or melting of ice or frost
 bhu-akruti vigyaan par vivartanik prabhaav lakhon saal se lekar ek minute yaa usase kam ke paimaane kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 The effect of tectonics on the landscape largely depends on the design of the underlying rocky bedrock that governs what type of local morphology the tectonics will give
 bukamp, minuton ke andar, vistrut bhu-bhaag ko jalplavit kar sakate hai or ne ardrapradeshon ko janm de sakate hai
 Isostatic rebound can result in significant changes over hundreds or thousands of years and allows additional erosion of the mountain chain, as larger portions are removed from the chain and uplift of the tropics
 dirghakaalik plate vivartanik gatishiltaa, lakhon varshiya jeevankaal vaale orogenic katibandh, vishaal parvat maalaon ko ubharti he, jo nadi or pahari dhalaan kii ucch dar kii prakriyaaon kaa centre hoti he or is prakaar dirghakaalik avsaad utpaadan karti he
 Characteristics of deep crust dynamics, such as plumes and non-lamination of the lower lithosphere, are also believed to play an important role in the large-scale evolution of the Earth's topography in the long term
 donon hi isostacy ke madhyam se utthan ko prerit kar sakate hai, kyonki garam, kam ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaane, dharti ke andar apekshaakrit thandi, adhik ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaanon ko visthapit kar detii hai
 Volcanic and volcanic igneous processes can have a significant impact on geomorphology

 The cone formed by detonation also creates substantial new topography, on which other surface processes can perform their work
 lava kii upsatahi gatividhi bhi bhu-akruti vigyaan main ek bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The melting below the surface can cause inflation and deflation of the ground surface and the partially molten crust layer beneath Tibet has been contributed to control the landscape of the Tibetan plateau spanning thousands of kilometers
 bhu-akritiyon ke saath jeevon kaa sampark yaa jaev-bhu-akritik prakriyaayein kai roopon kii ho sakati hai or shaayad sthaliy bhu-akritik pranali ke liye samgr rup se kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Biology can affect many geomorphic processes, ranging from biogeochemical processes that control chemical weathering to the effects of mechanical processes such as digging and tree throws on soil development and even global erosion rates
 It also involves controlling and modifying the climate through carbon dioxide balance
 sthaliy bhu-drishy jisamen satahi prakriyaaon main madhyasthata karne main jeev-vigyaan kii bhoomika ko nishchit rup se baahar rakhaa ja saktaa he, atyant durlabh hai, lekin ve anya grahon jaise mangal kii bhu-akruti vigyaan ko samajhane ke liye mahatvapurn jaankaree pradaan kar sakate hai
 Different spatial and temporal scales are dominated by different geomorphic processes

 They are present on one-third of the way from the coast of Philippine and East Malaysia towards southern Vietnam
 inamen kul milakar chaar varg kimi zamin se bhi kam kshetrafal he or yah 4,25,000 varg kimi ke samudri kshetra par faile hue hai
 Although there are no humans living on these small islands and reefs and they do not have much economic value, but the maritime boundary of any country under which it is subjected will be greatly expanded and under the United Nations Maritime Law Treaty, the minerals found under them But the fish in it will become the exclusive rights of that country

 Marketing is a continuous process under which marketing mix is planned and implemented
 yah prakriya vyaktiyon or sanghathanon ke bich utpaadon, sevaaon yaa vichaaron ke vinimay hetu kii jaati he
 Marketing is seen as a creative industry, including advertising, distribution and sales
 It is also related to forethought of customers' future needs and aspirations, often explored through market research
 multah, vipanan kisi sanghathan ko banane yaa nirdeshit karne karne kii prakriya he, taaki logon ko safaltaapurvak vah utpaada yaa seva bechi ja sake jisaki na keval unhen zarurat he balki ve use kharidne ke icchhuk bhi hai
 Therefore, good marketing should be able to create an "offer" or set of benefits for the consumers, so that the customer is paid the value of his money through products or services
 iske visheshgy kshetron main shaamil hai : introduction ek bazaar kendrit yaa upabhokta kendrit sanghathan pehle yah tay karata he kii uskaa sambhavit graahak chahta kya he or tab utpaada yaa seva kii rachana kii jaati he
 Marketing principles and practices are considered justified when a customer uses a product or service when in need, or gains an perceived advantage
 vipanan ke do pramukh ghatak hai- nae graahakon ko shaamil karnaa tathaa maujuuda graahakon ko banaae evam unke saath sambandhon kaa vistaar karnaa 
 ek baar jab vikreta aane vaale kharidaar ko apana graahak bana letaa he to aadhaar prabandhan shuru ho jaataa he
 The process that begins under Aadhaar management involves the seller developing a relationship with its customer, nurturing the relationship, increasing the benefits offered and continuously improving its product / service so that its business is protected from competitors are
 vipanan yojana kii safalataa ke liye 4 Ps kaa mishran upabhoktaaon yaa lakshith bazaar kii maangon va zaruuraton main pratibimbit hona chahie
 ek bazaar khand ko vah kharidne ke liye raji karnaa jisaki unhen zarurat nahin, bahut hi kharchila kaam he or shaayad hi kabhi safal hota he
 Marketers rely on information from both formal and informal marketing research and decide what the customer wants and how much they are willing to pay for it
 vipanak aashaa karte hai kii is prakriya se unhen ek satat pratiyogi laabh hasil hoga
 vipanan prabandhan is prakriya hetu vyaavhaarik anuprayog he
 The proposal is also an important part of the 4 Ps principle
 america vipanan sangh ke anusaar, "vipanan ek sanghathanaatmak kaary or prakriyaaon kaa ek samooh he jisase graahak banaaye jate hai, unase sampreshan kiya jaataa he or unhen upyogita pradaan kii jaati he tathaa upabhokta se rishte banaaye jate hai taaki sanghathan evam uske hitdharakon ko laabh mili
 Methods of marketing have been reported in many social sciences, especially in psychology, sociology and economics
 The influence of anthropology is also small but increasing
 bazaar anusandhan in gatividhiyon ko majbooti detaa he
 Marketing through advertising also connects to many creative arts
 vipanan ek vistrut evam kai prakashnon se bade str par paraspar sambaddh vishay he
 It is notorious for recreating itself and its terminology in a new way according to time and culture
 "vipanan" ek jaankaree dene vaala vyavsaayik kaary he jo lakshya kiye ja rahe bazaar ko company va uske utpaadon ke pratispardhaatmak laabh evam keemat ke bare suchit va shikshit karata he
 Price is the price a customer pays to own or use a product
 "pratispardhaatmak laabh " is baat ko darshata he kii company yaa uske utpaada donon apane pratidwandi se behatar aisa kuch kar rahe hai jisase upabhokta ko phayda pahunche
 The center of marketing is on delivering company and product related information to certain customers
 vipanan kaary main kai nirnay kiye jate hai kii koun si soochna deni he, kitni soochna deni he, kisko deni he, kaise deni he or kahaan deni he
 Once decisions are made, there are several methods and procedures that can be implemented in support of selected strategies
 vipanan kya he? main kris newton kehete hai vipanan ko aksar galatfahami main vigyaapan yaa bikri samaj liya jaataa he
 Marketing is defined as all the strategies and decisions that are decided in the following twelve areas: vipanan kaa dhyey he company or uske utpaadon ke liye lakshith bazaaron main praathamikta kaa nirmaan karnaa tathaa use banaaye rakhana
 kisi bhi kaarobaar kaa abhipraay hota he apane graahakon ke saath paraspar laabhakaari evam sthaayee sambandhon kaa nirmaan karnaa
 haalanki vyapaar ke sabhi kshetra isi dhyey kii prapti ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai, kintu vipanan par sabase adhik isaki jimmedaari hoti he
 If its definition is seen in a larger scope, the marketing work is done in coordination with three subjects: "product marketing", "corporate marketing" and, "marketing communication"
 ranneetik vipanan : yah nirdhaarit karne kaa prayaas kii ek sanghathan bazaar main apane pratidwandiyon se kaise muqabla kare

 Operational marketing: is to attract and retain customers and be more and more useful to them
 saath hi tatpar sevaaon dwaara graahak ko santusht karnaa or uski apekshaaon par khara utarana he
 Operational marketing involves the determination of Porter's five forces 1960 ke dashak ke armbh main, profesar nil borden ne harvard bijness skool main company ke aise kaaryon kii pahchaan kii jo utpaada yaa sevaayen kharidne ke graahak ke faisle ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Bourdain suggested that all those steps the company takes are a "marketing mix"
 professor i

 In common parlance, "marketing" is the promotion of the product, especially advertising and branding, but in commercial use it means a wide range of marketing means customer-centricity
 utpaadon kaa vikaas graahakon ke ek samooh yaa kuch maamalon main kuch khaas graahakon kii aavashyaktaaon kii poorti hetu kiya jaataa he
 E
 Jerome mccarthy divided marketing into groups of four general activities
 His typology gained so much recognition worldwide that his "four P's" became part of the language
 ye chaar Ps hai: These four elements are known as the marketing mix, which a vendor uses to create a marketing plan
 kam keemat ke upabhokta utpaada ke vipanan main chaar p kaa model sabase adhik kaam aata he
 This model has to be adjusted in the case of industrial products, services, high value consumer products
 seva vipanan bejod kism kii sevaaon ke liye hona chahie

 sambandhon kaa vipanan main vipanan ko dirghakaalin sambandhon ke pariprekshya main dekha jaataa he bajaay vyaktigat vyavhaar ke
 Against this, Morgan suggested in Riding the Waves of Change, that one of the biggest drawbacks of the 4 Ps approach is that "it inadvertently emphasizes inward, while the essence of marketing must be outward"
 Nevertheless, 4 Ps is helpful as a memorable and workable guide and framework for the major categories of marketing work under which they can be used
 pehle se maujuud chaar Ps ke alaava sevaaon ke vipanan main teen atirikt sheershak jode gaye hai jinhen vistrut vipanan mishran kaha jaataa he
 These are: brands ek naam, shabd, dizine, pratik yaa koi anya visheshta he jo kisi utpaada yaa seva ko pratispardhi ke prastaav se alag karata he
 a brand represents the consumer's experience towards an organization, product, or service
 brands ko ek pahachaane jane yogya satta ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ek vishisht mulya kaa vaada karti hai
 Co-branding involves marketing activities involving two or more products
 mulya nirdhaaran se aashay us paise se he jo ek utpaada ke badale diya jaataa he
 This value is determined by the utility of the item, how much money and / or sacrifice the customer is willing to pay in return
 vipanan sanchaar ranneeti ke hisaab se vibhinn shreniyon ke liye vipanan sandesh taiyaar karata he or unhen tay lakshya kii ore preshit karata he
 There are separate stages of converting strangers into customers that control the communication medium used
 kisi vyakti yaa sambhavit graahakon ke samooh ko aprope karne vaale cells main dwaara maukhik prastuti: Short-term incentives to encourage product purchases iskaa ek udhaaharan he coupon yaa ek bikri

 In this, isoprene units interconnect to form squalene and then double and form a group of rings to produce lanastral
 lenasterol ko phir kalesterol or argostrol jaise anya stiridon main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The ability to synthesize 20 common amino acids varies from organism to organism
 adhikansh bacteria or paudhe sabhi bees kaa sanshleshan kar sakate hai, lekin stanpandi keval gyaarah anaavashyak amino amlon kaa sanshleshan kar sakate hai
 In this way, nine essential amino acids are to be obtained from food
 sabhi amino amla glikalisis, citric acid chakra, yaa paintose phosphate pathmarg ke madhyasthon se sanshleshit kiye jate hai
 Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine
 amino amla sanshleshan uchit alpha-kito amla ke banane par nirbhar hota he, jo phir transminikrut hokar amino amla kaa nirmaan karata he
 Amino acids are folded into proteins by adding peptides to form a chain
 prayek bhinn protein main amino acidon kii ek anuthi shrankhla hoti he
 In the same way that almost unlimited types of words can be formed by adding letters of the alphabet, in the same way amino acids can also be combined into different types of proteins to make a very large variety of proteins
 protein un amino acidon se banaae jate hai, jo transfar arene anu se ek aster band ke jariye judakar sakriy kiye gaye hon
 yah aminoesil-tiarene pricursor ek aminoesil tiarene singhtage dwaara kii gai ek atipi par nirbhar pratikriya main utpann hota he
 This aminoacyl-trna is then the substrate for the ribosome, which, using the chain information present in the messenger RNA, attaches to the amino acid on the lengthening protein chain
 newcliotide un pathmargon main amino acidon, carbon dioxide or farmik acid se banaae jate hai jinhen chayapachay urja kii badi maatra main jarurat padati he
 Consequently, most organisms have appropriate mechanisms to store preformed nucleotides
 pureenon kaa newcliosidon ke rup main sanshleshan kiya jaataa he
 Both adenine and guanine are formed from the precursor nucleoside inocene monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms derived from amino acids, glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, and a format different from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate
 duusari ore pyrimidine, glutamins or aspartate se bane kshar orotate se sanshleshit hota he
 All organisms are confronted with compounds that cannot be used as food and which, if stored in cells, can be harmful because they have no metabolic role
 Such harmful compounds are called xenobiotics
 sanshleshit aushadhiyon, prakritik vishon or antibioticon jaise jinobyoticon ko jinobiotic-chayapachayee anzimon ke ek samooh dwaara niskriy kiya jaataa he
 In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidase, udp-glucurunosyltransferase, and glutathione S-transferase
 anzimon kaa yah tantra teen avasthaaon main kaary karata he, pehle jinobiotic ko oxykrut karnaa or phir jal-ghulansheel samoohon ko anu par kanjuget karnaa
 sanshodhit jal-ghulansheel jinobiotic ko phir koshika ke baahar pump kar diya jaataa he or bahukoshikeey jeevon main baahar nikaalane ke pehle or chaypachayit kiya jaataa he
 In ecology, these reactions are particularly important for bioremediation of biodegradable bacteria by contaminants and the loss of contaminated ground and oil
 inamen se kai jeevanu pratikriyaayein bahukoshikeey jeevon main bhi hoti hai, lekin jeevanuon ke avishwasaneey vividh prakaaron ke kaaran ye jeev bahukoshikeey jeevon kii apeksha kahin adhik prakaar ke jinobioticon kaa saamana kar sakate hai or arganochloride yogicon jaise hathi carbonic dushakon se bhi nipat sakate hai
 One problem related to aerobic organisms is oxidation pressure
 In this, processes including oxidative phosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds during the duplication of proteins produce reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide
 ye hanikaarak oxident oxikaranvirohi chayapachayakon jaise glutathaon or anzimon jaise catallejon or paraksidejon dwaara nishkasit kiye jate hai
 Living animals are required to follow the laws of thermodynamics, which describe the transfer and function of heat
 ushmpragatiki ke duusare niyam ke anusaar, kisi bhi band tantra main entropi main vruddhi hoti he
 Although the surprising complexity of living animals goes against this rule, life is possible because all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy from the environment around them
 is tarah jivit tantra santulan main nahin hote, balki nasht hone vaale tantra hai jo apane paryaavarnon main entropi main adhik vruddhi karke apni ucch jatilta kii sthiti bane rakhte hai
 The metabolism of the cell makes it possible by combining the natural processes of catabolism with the unnatural processes of anabolism
 ushmpragatiki kii bhashaa main, chayapachay asantulan utpann karke santulan banaae rakhata he
 Since the environment of most organisms is constantly changing, metabolic reactions need to be closely regulated to maintain a stable state in cells, known as homeostasis
 chayapachayee niyaman jeevon ko sanketon ke prati jawaab dene or apane paryaavarnon se sakriy rup se antarkriya karne main sahaayak hote hai
 Two strongly linked theories are important to understand the action of controlling metabolic pathways
 ek, kisi pathmarg main anzime ke niyaman ke anusaar sanket ke prati uski gatividhi badhati yaa ghatati he
 Secondly, the control by this enzyme is the effect of changes in activity on the overall rate of the pathway
 udaa
anzime apni gatividhi main bade parivartan dikhaata he, lekin yadi in parivartanon kaa chayapachayee pathmarg ke bahaav par thodaa sa prabhaav ho, to yah anzime pathmarg ke niyantran main shaamil nahin he
 There are many levels of metabolic regulation
 aantarik niyaman main chayapachayee pathmarg swatahniyaman karke sabstriton yaa utpaadanon ke staron main parivartanon ke prati pratikriya karata he
 For example, there is an increase in flow through the pathway when the output volume decreases
 is tarah ke niyaman main akasar pathmarg ke anek anzimon kii gatividhiyon kaa alosteric niyaman hota he
 In external control, one cell of a multicellular organism changes its metabolism according to the signals of other cells
 ye sanket saamanytah hormonon or vikaas karkon jaise ghulansheel sandeshvaahakon ke rup main hote hai or koshika-sataha par vishisht graahakon dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 These signals are then transmitted within the cell by second messenger systems, often involved in phosphorylation of proteins
 bahya niyantran kaa ek bahut acchhee tarah se samajha gaya udhaaharan he, insulin hormone dwaara glucose chayapachay kaa niyaman
 insulin kaa utpaadan rakt glucose staron ke badhane par hota he
 The binding of protein kinases is activated when hormones are attached to insulin clients located on cells, which take glucose by cells and convert it into accumulation molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen
 glykojan kaa chayapachay anzime phospharillage, jo glykojan kaa vighatan karata he or glykojan synthej, jo use banaata he, dwaara niyantrit hota he
 Phosphorylation inhibits glycogen synthase, but activates phosphorylase
 insulin protein phosphatejon ko sakriy karke or in anzimon ke phospharilikaran main kami laakar glykojan kaa sanshleshan karwaata he
 The central pathways of metabolism mentioned above, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, occur in all three classes of living things and were present in the last world ancestor
 yah saarvbhaumik purvaj koshika prokarotic or shaayad methenojan thi jisamen vyapak amino acid, newcliotide, carbohydrate or vasa chayapachay hota tha
 It is possible for these ancient pathways to be kept in further development for these specific metabolic problems to be appropriately resolved for these reactions, as pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle produce their end-products in a more appropriate way and at least in stages
 Huh
 anzime par aadhaarit chayapachay ke pehle pathmarg pureen newcliotide chayapachay ke hisse ho sakate hai, jisamen pehle ke chayapachayee pathmarg pracheen arene duniya ke bhaag the
 Several models have been presented to explain how new metabolic pathways are generated
 inamen nae anzimon kaa kisi chote purvaj pathmarg se shrankhla main judana, saare pathmargon ke praturup banaakar phir unka hat janaa, pehle se maujuud eximon kaa chayan or naveen pratikriya pathmarg main unka jamaav shaamil he
 The predictive significance of these processes is unclear, but genomic studies suggest shared pathways have common ancestors of pathway enzymes, suggesting that several pathways have evolved in turn, including new activity at steps already present in the pathway
 Are made
 chayapachayee network main proteinon kii rachanaaon ke vikaas ke liye kiye gaye adhyayanon se praapt ek vaikalpik model ke anusaar anzimon kaa chayan vyapak rup se hota he, jisamen bhinn chayapachayee pathmargon main samaan prakaar ke kaary karne ke liye anzime udhaar liye jate hai
 These selection processes cause a developmental enzymatic mosaic to form
 ek teesri sambhaavna he, chayapachay ke kuch bhaag madulon kii tarah rah sakate hai, jinhen bhinn pathmargon main punah kaam main liya ja saktaa he or jo bhinn anuon main samaan tarah ke kaary karte hai
 Like the development of new metabolic pathways, metabolic function may be decreased due to growth
 udaa

 a decrease in similar metabolic abilities is seen in endosymbiotic organisms
 chayapachay kaa adhyayan maanya rup se apghatiy tareeke se kiya jaataa he, jo ek chayapachay pathmarg par kendrit hota he
 Most important in this is the use of radioactive lasers at the entire organism, tissue, and cellular level, which identify radioactively labeled mediators and products and define pathways from ancestor to final production
 in rasaynic pratikriyaaon ko utprerit karne vaale anzimon kaa tab shuddhikaran kiya ja saktaa he or unki gatiki va avarodhakon ke prati unki pratikriyaaon kii jaanch kii ja sakati he
 a parallel approach is to identify small molecules in a cell or tissue
 a complete group of these molecules is called a metabolome

 Metabolic networks of bacteria seem to be good examples of bow-tie combinations, which, using relatively low intermediates, can produce large variety of products and complex microbes with the help of large chains of nutrients
 is jaankaree kaa ek mukhya takneekee upyog chayapachayee ejineering he
 This involves modification of organism genes such as yeast, plant or bacteria, making them more useful in biotechnology and helpful in the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1,3-propanediol and shikimic acid
 in jeneey sanshodhano kaa uddeshy utpaadan main lagane vaali urja kii maatra ko kam karne or vyarth padaarthon kaa utpaadan kam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term metabolism derives from the Greek word, metabolismos - change or reverse

 The theory of metabolism dates from the time of Ibn al-nafis, who stated that, 'the body and its parts are constantly in a state of disintegration and nourishment
 maanav ke chayapachay ke pehle prayogon kaa prakaashan santorio santorio ne 1614 main unki pustak ars di statica medecina main kiya
 He told how he weighed himself before and after eating, sleeping, working, sex, fasting, drinking and excreting
 He found that most of the diet he took disappeared through 'insensitive perspiration'

 While studying fermentation of yeast into sugar alcohols in the 19th century, Louis Pasteur observed that fermentation was catalyzed by substances located in yeast cells, which he called 'fermenters'
 He wrote that, 'alcoholic fermentation is a function related to the life and composition of yeast cells and has nothing to do with the death or decay of cells'
 This discovery and the publication of chemical synthesis of urea in 1828 by Friedrich Wohler proved that there is no theoretical difference in the organic compounds found in cells and in any other part of chemical reactions and chemistry

 There are actually two types of mental processes underlying the mental process of imagination - first, the recollection of past sensibilities, the form of images and thoughts, that is, memory, second, the creation of those mismatched experiences in a new combination
 lekin kalpana main in donon prakaar kii kriyaaon kaa itnaa adhik sammishran rahata he ki na to inkaa alag-alag adhyayan hi kiya ja saktaa he or na inaki alag-alag spasht anubhuti hi vyaktivishesh ko ho paati he
 For this reason, imagination is called a highly complex mental process
 kalpana evam chintan kii maansik prakriyaaon kii prakruti itani adhik samaan hoti he ki saadhaaran bhashaa main kabhi-kabhi inkaa paryaayavachi shabdon ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 From the point of view of equality, both actions are a reminder of past experiences and to create a new combination of them, and both actions arise to find a way to satisfy the dissatisfied needs and desires of the person
 lekin donon ke uddeshy bhinn hote hai
 Imagination seeks unrealistic, irrational and imaginary creative solutions to satisfy needs, the purpose of thinking is always to find logical and real solutions and hence it is also called logical action
 chintan kii kriya tab tak prarambh nahin hogi jab tak koi vaastavik samasya aavashyaktaaon kii santushti main maarg main upasthit na ho
 But imagination can also begin with the presence of unrealistic and imaginary problems
 kalpana ko bhi do prakaaron main baanta jaataa he
 The first type of fantasy encompasses daydreams and mental flights with the help of which a person creates an imaginary world, which becomes more important for the satisfaction of his needs than the real world
 is prakaar kii kalpana se sabhi saamaanya vyakti labhanvit hote hai tathaa apni bhautik asamarthta ke maansik kuprabhav se apni raksha karte hai
 But the frequency of this type of imagination becomes a predominant symptom of mental patients, which results in the creation of bizarre illusions

 Only creative people can do creative compositions
 sarjanaatmak kalpana kaa vishleshan karte hue pratibhashali helmholts, pvaankaar, graham vailes aadi ne isaki chaar avasthaaen bataai hai–taiyaari, nilyan, uchhwasan tathaa pramaapan 
 In the first stage, the creator examines the reality of his problem and purpose by uniting various facts and observations
 duusari avasthaa main koi spasht pragati drushtigat nahin hoti lekin, vastav main, vibhinn upakalpanaaon kaa aantarik manan chalata rahata he
 The most important is the third stage in which divine inspiration is attained and creation is done
 agar yah srijan kaary vaigyanik upakalpana ke rup main he to uski satyata ko pramanit karnaa hota he tathaa, agar vah saahitiyik vaa kalatmak srijan kaary he, to use apane-apane prakaashan ke madhmamon se vyakti karnaa hota he
 The facts that psychologists Rousman, Beade, and Platt and Baker have obtained from researchers and scientists, and C
 Patrick Madam from poets and painters, support these four stages of creative imagination
 kalpana ke shaareerik aadhaar ke sambandh main bhi do prakaar ke siddhant prachlit hai–pehla, kendriya siddhant ke anusaar, jo pracheen siddhant he, kalpana mastishk kii jatil kriyaaon par aadhaarit he or uskaa hi ek ang he
 Secondly, it is known as motivational or periphery theory, according to which imagination is a behavior, so it also contains the physical functions of the senses, brain and muscles like ordinary behavior
 is siddhant kaa samarthan vibhinn manovaigyanik prayogon ke madhyam se jaikbasan, maiks, sha, aserinsky or kalitmaan aadi ne kiya he or yahi siddhant dinondin adhik maanya hota ja rahaa he

 There is a famous water tank about forty feet long and twenty five feet wide in the street called daiv-marg of Mohan Jodaro, which is seven feet deep
 kunda main uttar or dakshin se seedhiyaan utarati hai
 There are chambers of sadhus on three sides of the pool
 iske uttar main 8 snanaghar hai
 This pool has been made very intelligently, because no one's gate opens in front of the other

 roman sena kii pragati ko ham chaar pramukh bhaagon main baant sakate hai
 The army was a civilian army in the early era of Rome
 phir iskaa vikaas vijayi ganatantric sena main hua, jisane kramash: italy or bumadhyasagariya kshetra kaa daman kiya
 The infantry of the civilians evolved into a salaried army with its long service and organization, eventually changing in size according to the needs of each year
 uske baad yah suraksha kii samrajyavahini bani
 Changed from the civilian army to a malicious army, it also had representatives from Italy and territories
 ant main junglee ghudsavaaron ke akramanon ne ek maidani sena ke nirmaan ke liye baadhya kiya, jo seemaa durgrakshak sena se bhinn thi or jisamen badi sankhya main savaar sammilit hue or jo sheeghra hi paidal sena se adhik mahatvashaalee siddh hui
 The Roman army was at first an army of foot soldiers, in later stages it was dominated by cavalry
 yah deergh vikaas nirantar chalata rahaa
 In fact, this development is so unbreakable that many military technical words continued to be used for ages
 yadhyapi unke arth main gambhir sanshodhan hue, kintu unka swaroop aparivartit vyavastha main nihit he
 Legion terminology, for example, comes in all four stages
 kintu prayek main iskaa mahatv bhinn he
 This always led to the realization of the civilian soldiers, it also always revealed that it was an army which, if not completely, was predominantly huge infantry, but the composition of these two successive structures changed from time to time
 pratham avadhi main lijan anivaary bharti sena thi, maidan sanbhaalane ke liye jiskaa aavahan kiya jaataa tha
 In the second period, the 'legion' was not an entire army, rather it was one of the main units in which the army was divided from the developing organization, the Legion was now a group of about five thousand persons
 lijanon kii sankhya paristhiti ke anusaar badalati thi or sena main nagarikon ke atirikt duusari tukadiyaan bhi sammilit thim, yadhyapi adhiktar ve mahatvapurn nahin thim
 In the third or imperialist era many of the legends were located in special fortifications, there were other contingents which had large numbers and which were important, though not yet as large as the legions
 ant main limons choti ikaiyaan ban gayi or anya tathaa ghudsavaar sena rome kii vaastavik yuddh vahini bani
 The history of the early Roman army is not well recorded and is often corrupted by false imaginations
 ham teen sau savaaron kii praarambhik vahini tathaa teen hajaar paidal sainikon, jinamein ghudsavaar lagbhag sab kuch samajhe jate the, ke vishay main padhate hai
 But this number is clearly artificial and conceived
 ghudsavaaron ko di gai pramukhataa kaa koi ullekh uttar rome ke itihaas main nahin miltaa
 We reach a firm level with the organization made by Servius Tullius

 pracheen adhikari batalaate hai ki camilas ne vetan or deergh seva kaa prarambh kiya, kavach or hathiyaaron main sudhaar kiya or sena ke chote chote divijan banaae
 Whatever the truth about Camillus, some such reforms must have been made to change the Sarvian system into an army that took nearly three centuries to conquer Italy and the world

 Often the invasion started from one side, as Caesar did in Persecles

 With his Spanish auxiliary forces in the middle and the Roman troops on the side, he again attacked from both sides, inspiring the center

 Long-term foreign wars in Spain and the east had substantial effects

 Consequently, in about 104 BC, Marius abolished the old ban of military service to humans on the basis of some form of wealth

 For 20 years, there was chaos, so it was necessary to reestablish royalism and order equally
 augustus ne jis prakaar apane sabhi kaamon ko puraani baton kaa anusaran karte hue kiya usee prakaar usne yah bhi kiya
 Yet there is truth in the statement that his military reforms are his greatest and most fundamental work

 The first class was the army in which Roman citizens, whether they were residents of Italy or the provinces, were recruited
 duusari shrenee sahaayak sena se bani thi, jisamen samrajya kii praja bhartee kii jaati thi
 Rome also had special types of domestic troops and a large contingent of vigilis or guards who served as both the fire brigade and the police
 yadi lijns or sahaayak sena kii yah vyavastha samrajya ke praarambhik dinon main anuthi thi, to inkaa prayog bhi isse kam anoothaa nahin tha
 a large strategic army is seen in the later republics, although there is also a tendency to have a special legion system for specific regions, but this trend is very weak
 augustus ne vishaal samrik sena ke yug ko samaapt kar diya vah rajsinghaasana ke bhavi daavedaaron ke liye aise hathiyaaron kii chhot nahin de saktaa tha
 He developed a second trend, keeping the empire within a certain range

 The early Roman Empire did not face a war crisis with the same enemy as the modern empires and the need to induce its entire national army to wage war

 There was no need for a steadfast force concentrated in two or one cantonments to counter them, but rather a large number of scattered guards at each border with a few strong forts near them which served as military centers for these guards

 Sometimes, where the Rhine or Danube did not help, and where there were plenty of external enemies, the additional fortifications of the border were made by frequent walls of wooden poles or by stone walls, or by roads guarded by outposts along the border
 The border was protected

 Two major reasons led to a gradual change in the army of Augustus
 sarvapratham romasamrajya kii shanti ne anek jilon main aisi samruddhi laa di ki un jilon se paryaapt maatra main sainik milane band ho gaye
 Like the British in India, the Romans also had to pay more attention to uncultivated parts and outside their borders

 More and more non-roman elements were seen in the army

 This increased the power of their cavalry relatively and a specific regional battle force began to organize

 New cross-border forces were established and the ancient army reorganized into a battlefield that could, or could, march with the emperor during wartime

 Then there was no such organization even within the empire

 But the army was such a group of territorial forces that in each state a lot was left to the top officers

 The rest may be either ecotype or subfamily
 The implication would be that G
 Biloba, which grew in a very wide range, had a remarkable genetic flexibility and although genetically developed it never showed much speciation
 While it may seem unlikely that a species can exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of Ginkgo's life-history standards are accurate

 In 2002, a long-anticipated form was presented at JAMA entitled "ginko for Memory Enhancement: a Randomized Controlled Trial
" This Williams College study, which was sponsored by the National Institute of Aging rather than Schwabe, examined the effects of ginkgo intake on healthy volunteers above 60 years of age
 This conclusion, now cited in the National Institute of Health's ginko fact sheet, states that: "ginkgo, when taken according to the manufacturer's instructions, is associated with any cognitive function in memory or in adults with healthy cognitive mechanisms
 Does not provide a clear benefit
 "


 the impact of this seemingly fatal assessment was further corrected by a Schwabe-sponsored study around the same time that a lower order Ishtit journal Human was published in Psychopharmacology
