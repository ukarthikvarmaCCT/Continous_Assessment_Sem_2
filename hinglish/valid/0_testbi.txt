 Party chief Uddhav Thackeray has now also targeted the BJP on issues like mob lynching and cow protection
 saath hi hindutv ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 In an interview printed in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Uddhav said that the Hindutva that Balasaheb Thackeray used to talk about was Shivaji Maharaj's Hindutva, but the hysteria of Hindutva that has raged in the country for the last 3 years is not right
 iske alaava unhonehindutv or gaayake naam par mob linching ko bhi galat tehraaya
 Thackeray said, 'the cow is being protected, but the country is becoming the most insecure about women
 uski shame honi chahie
 Protect Gomata but what to protect mother? ‚Äùuddhav Thackeray alleged that the government is engaged in investigating who is eating what meat except women
 unhone saaf kaha ki ise hindutv nahin kaha ja saktaa, ye bhram failaa rahaa he
 Amit Shah is said to be angry with the Shiv Sena's decision to abstain from voting on the no-confidence motion
 amit shah ne avishvaas prastaav se ek din pehle hi shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ko phone kiya tha
 After that, there was a possibility that Shiv Sena would support the government
 avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan shivasena ke bartaav se naaraaz amit shah ne mumbai main maharashtra bijepi ke netaaon se kaha ki jis tarah beete kuch samay se shivasena kaa vyavhaar rahaa he, khaaskar avishvaas prastaav main anupasthiti, uske baad hamenmaharashtra main akele chunaavladana pad saktaa he

 On the other hand, the dairy chairman has been running away since morning

 However, when the Aaj Tak team reached the spot, urea was also scattered in Vigilance jeep

 loksabhaa chunaav kii tareekhon ke elaan main deree ko lekar kai logon ne prashn khadey kiye
 But the truth is that the term of the Modi government in the 16th Lok Sabha is coming to an end on June 3, so the election process should be finished before that
 chunaav ayog ne 10 march ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye adhisuchana jari kii
 Earlier in 2009, election dates were announced on March 2, while in 2014 elections were announced on March 5
 lihaaja chunaav ke elaan kii taarikh koi mudda nahin he
 Because the Election Commission has to take care of many things other than dates, such as availability of central force, number of voting stages, etc
 jaise 2019 main chunaav 7 charan main hone , jabaki 2014 main 9 charan main chunaav hue the
 Whereas on 16 May the electoral process came to an end

 But the truth is that the term of the Modi government is to end on June 3
 isse pehle chunaav ayog ko chunaav kii sabhi prakriya puri kar leni hogi
 At the same time, various political parties and coalitions will be given the opportunity to stake claim to form the government on the basis of their seats

 In 2014, the cabinet of the NDA government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party with a historic majority was sworn in on 26 May at the Rashtrapati Bhavan campus
 lekin gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki sansad sadasyon ne 4 june ko shapath lee thi

 ullekhneey he ki ravivaar ko chunaav ayog ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 kaa elaan kar diya
 Voting for the 17th Lok Sabha is to be held in 7 phases - April 11, 18, 23, 29 and May 6, 12 and 19

 According to officials of the central agencies and emergency response team investigating the case on the demand of the state government, it appears that some mlas are scared of intimidation and have to deposit ransom money in the accounts mentioned
 jaanch agency ke adhikariyon ne bataaya ki ab tak kii jaanch main is baat ke saboot mili hai ki sandigdh acounts main may ke pehle saptaah main kuch paise jamaa kiye gaye or may ke tisare saptaah main paise nikaal liye gaye
 Investigating officials suspect that the money sought is extortion money
 kyonki paise jamaa karne or nikaale jane kii avadhi rangadari ke liye vidhayakon ke mobile par aae sandeshon kii avadhi ke ird-gird hi he
 Sources associated with the investigation told 'aaj Tak' that the entire money was withdrawn within just two weeks of depositing the money, which raises doubts
 jaankaree ke mutabik, paise ek kryptokarency wolet main jamaa karwaae gaye
 The account holder has cashed all the money deposited in the cryptocurrency wallet and now the balance of this cryptocurrency wallet is zero

 The man who gave the threatening message described himself as a man of Ali Budesh, a special henchman of India's most wanted underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, although Ali Budesh has clearly refused to ask mlas for extortion from Aaj Tak

 Investigations have also revealed that messages threatening BJP mlas have come from Pakistan, although so far these number holders have not been identified

 com / ukkev6kgpq flipcart ke liye kaam karne vaala nanjundaswami ek smartphone kii delivery dene ke liye 9 disambar ko bengaluru main ek gym main pahunchaa, lekin jis vyakti, gym trainer ne us phone kaa order diya tha, vah chaaku lekar uskaa intazaar kar rahaa tha
 a few days later, the body of 29-year-old Nanjundaswamy was recovered, which was strangled
 darasal, 22-varshiya gym trainer varun kumaar ke paas itane paise nahin the ki vah smartphone kharid saktaa, to usne kisi bhi keemat par phone hasil karne kii saazish rachi, bhale hi uske liye use delivery karne aae shaks kaa katl hi kyon na karnaa pade
 Recently, after starting a job in the gym, Varun found that most of his co-workers had smartphones, so he requested his father to get a similar phone, but he was told that he would have to buy it by earning money himself
 
 iske baad varun ne onlil jaakar smartphone kaa order kar diya, or apane pate ke taur par gym kaa pataa de diya
 Police say that Varun attacked Nanjundaswamy with an iron rod and a vase when he arrived to deliver the smartphone
 jab nanjundaswami behosh ho gaya, varun ne kathith rup se uskaa galaa ret daalaa, or phir uske shav ko ghasitkar tahkhaane main le gaya
 Varun allegedly kept a smartphone valued at around Rs 12,000, and also stole other phones in Nanjundaswamy's bag
 jab do din tak nanjundaswami ghar nahin lautaa, to uske parivaar ne gumshudagi kii report darj karwaai
 When police arrive at the gym building, looking for his last place of delivery, they find Nanjundaswamy's body in the basement
 jald hi kadiyaan varun tak pahunch gayi, jisane katl ke baad se gym ko band hi kar rakhaa tha
 He was arrested this week
 tippaniyan Police believe that Varun had already hatched the murder plot because he had brought the knife used in the kitchen to the gym a day before the delivery of the phone
 ab is baat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki kya is aparaadh main varun ne kisi kii madad lee thi
 According to a Flipkart spokesperson, Nanjundaswamy used to work in an agency that used to do the delivery work for online shopping company Flipkart
 pravaktaa ne yah bhi kaha ki nanjundaswami ke parivaar ko aarthik sahaayta di jaaegi
 In fact, 22-year-old gym trainer Varun Kumar did not have enough money to buy a smartphone, so he planned to get the phone at any cost, even if he had to kill the person who came to deliver it
 
 haal hi main gym main naukari shuru karne ke baad varun ne paaya ki uske adhiktar sahakarmiyon ke paas smartphone hai, so, usne bhi apane pita se aisa hi phone dilaane kaa anurodh kiya, lekin usase kah diya gaya ki smartphone use khud paise kamakar khareednaa hoga
 After this, Varun went online and ordered a smartphone, and gave Jim's address as his address
 police kaa kahana he ki varun ne smartphone deliver karne pahunche nanjundaswami par lohe kii chad or phooldaan se hamalaa kiya
 When Nanjundaswamy fainted, Varun allegedly sanded his throat, and then dragged his body to the basement
 varun ne lagbhag 12,000 rupee keemat vaala smartphone to kathith rup se apane paas rakh hi liya, usne nanjundaswami ke bag main maujuud anya phone bhi chura liye
 When Nanjundaswamy did not return home for two days, his family lodged a missing report
 jab police uski aakhri jelivery kii jagah talashti hui gym kii imaarat tak pahunchi, unhen nanjundaswami kaa shav tahkhaane main mil gaya
 Soon the episodes reached Varun, who had kept the gym closed since the murder
 use isi hafte giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The comments police kaa maananaa he ki varun ne katl kii saazish pehle se rach rakhi thi, kyonki usne phone kii delivery se ek din pehle hi rasoi main istemaal hone vaala chaaku laakar gym main rakh liya tha
 Now it is being tried to find out if Varun had taken help from anyone in this crime
 flipcart ke pravaktaa ke mutabik nanjundaswami ek agency main naukari karata tha, jo online shopping company flipcart ke liye delivery kaa kaam karti thi
 The spokesman also said that financial support will be provided to Nanjundaswamy's family

 chhattisgarh kii rajdhani raipur ke paas ek datonating fus company main shuukravaar tadake hue dhamaake main paanch mazdooron kii maut ho gai
 The accident occurred at Navbharat Fuse Company, located in the small Urla village of Abhanpur block, about 40 km from Raipur
 police adhikariyon ke tadake 2:30 se teen baje ke bich ek kamare main rakhe visphotakon main dhamaakaa hua
 Seven employees, including a supervisor, were present in the room, but minutes before the explosion, the supervisor and a laborer exited
 kamare main bache baaki paanch mazdooron kii dhamaake main maut ho gai
 But SP state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary says, "our party has fielded a very strong candidate from Varanasi
 vah puri takat se chunaav lard rahi hai
 She is also giving a tough competition
 vaak over vaali baat puri tarah galat he
 The country is going to get a new Prime Minister
 " donon dal ab chaahe jo kahen, lekin yah spasht he ki is baar varanasi kaa chunaav charchaa se baahar ho gaya he
 In 2014, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) candidate Arvind Kejriwal had lost the election against Modi, but he presented a tough challenge
 kejariwal ke kaaran desh-duniya kii najar 2014 main varanasi seat par aa tiki thi
 However, Kejriwal had to be content with a little over two lakh votes, and Narendra Modi emerged victorious by getting 5 lakh 81 thousand votes
 congress ke ajay raay ko lagbhag 76 hajaar vot mili the
 Kailash Chaurasia of SP got 45,291 votes and bsp's Vijay Prakash Jaiswal got 60,579 votes
 narendra modi 2014 ke chunaav main ek ranneeti ke tahat varanasi gaye the, or vah apane makasad main safal bhi hue the
 This time too, his motive is the same
 aisa samajha ja rahaa tha ki vipaksh modi ko gherne ke liye koi saajha or majboot ummidavaar utaaregaa
 This possibility was also boosted by the delay in the announcement of opposition candidates from Varanasi
 priyanka kii ummidavaari kii charchaa chal padi thi
 There was an increase in curiosity among the people
 lekin pehle shalini yadav or phir ajay raay kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi varanasi seat ko lekar logon kii utsukata thandhi pad gai
 Says senior political analyst Ratanamani Lal, "there were a few seats, including Banaras, Lucknow, where a strategy was put in place by the Congress and the SP-BSP
 parantu aapasi matbhed ke chalate aisa nahin ho sakaa
 The day Home Minister Rajnath Singh filed his nomination from Lucknow, the same day the SP-BSP and Congress declared their candidates
 yahi sthit banaras main bhi dekhne ko mili
 If the opposition united and fielded a strong candidate in Benaras, its big message would have gone
 "unhone kaha, "2014 main modi ke khilaaf arvind kejariwal ladane aae the
 He may have lost the election, but due to Kejriwal, the election of Varanasi was a topic of discussion all over the world
 " ek anya raajnneetik vishleshak premshankar mishra ke anusaar, "sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke paas majboot chehre kaa abhaav tha
 Mukhtar Ansari had a tough fight against Murali Manohar Joshi in the 2009 elections, but this time the coalition might not want to take the risk that would lead to polarization
 congress kii taraf se priyanka ke chunaav ladane kii charchaa bhale ho rahi thi, lekin congress apane trump card ko kharaab nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 If Priyanka had lost the election, the politics of Gandhi family would have ended
 " unhone kaha, "haa, congress ne ajay raay ke alaava varanasi main koi majboot pratyaashee diya hota to ladaai dilachasp hoti, or aasapaas kii siton par bhi iskaa prabhaav dikhataa
 But this could not happen
 " varanasi main antim charan ke tahat 19 may ko matdaan hoga, or matganana 23 may ko hogi
