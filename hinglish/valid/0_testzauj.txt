 The origins of sociology, including economic, political and cultural systems, are proto-sociological in the combined repository of Western knowledge and philosophy
 plato ke samay se hi saamaajik vishleshan kiya janaa shuru ho gaya

 It was later founded in 1838 by August Comt

 comt ne saamaajik kshetron kii vaigyanik samaj ke madhyam se itihaas, manovigyaan or arthshaastra ko ekajute karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Writing shortly after the distraction of the French Revolution, he established that social evils can be overcome through social determinism, a philosophical approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy and a General View of Positiveism
 comt ko vishwaas tha ki ek 'pratyakshvaadi str' maanviya samaj ke kram main, dharmik atakalon or aadhyatmik charnon ke baad antim daur ko chihnit karegaa
 Although Comt is often considered the "father of sociology", the subject was formally founded by another structural pragmatic thinker Emil Durkheim, who established the first European Academic Department and later developed positivism

 The systematic approach of early theorists towards sociology was to deal with this subject in the same manner as natural science
 kisi bhi saamaajik daawey yaa nishkarsh ko ek nirvivaad aadhaar pradaan karne hetu or apekshaakrit kam anubhavjanya kshetron se jaise darshan se samajashaastra ko pruthak karne ke liye anubhavvaad or vaigyanik vidhi ko mahatv dene kii talash kii gai
 This approach, called positivism, is based on the assumption that only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge and that such knowledge can only come from positive confirmation of theories, through rigorous scientific and quantitative methods
 emil durkhim saidhantik rup se aadhaarit anubhavjanya anusandhan ke ek bade samarthak the, jo sanrachanaatmak niyamon ko darshane ke liye "saamaajik tathyon" ke bich sambandho ko talash rahe the

 Reactions against positivism began when the German philosopher Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel voiced against both empiricism, which he dismissed as non-critical and determinism, and which he saw as over-mechanistic
 Karl Marx's methodology was not only derived from Hegel's provincial linguism, but also the exclusion of positivism in favor of critical analysis, seeking to complete the empirical acquisition of "facts" while erasing illusions
 uskaa maananaa rahaa ki anumaanon ko sirf likhane kii bajaay unki samiksha honi chahie
 Despite this, Marx attempted to publish a science of society based on economic determinism of historical materialism

 The first generation of German sociologists at the end of the 20th century formally introduced procedural non-positivism, with the proposition that research should focus on human culture's standards, values, symbols, and subjective perspectives on social processes
 maiks webar ne tark diya ki samajashaastra kii vyakhya halke taur par ek 'vigyaan' ke rup main kii ja sakati he, kyonki yah khaas kar jatil saamaajik ghatana ke adarsh varg athwa kaalpanik sarleekaran ke bich - kaaran-sambandhon ko pahchaanane main sakasham he
 However, as a non-positivist, in contrast to the relationships discovered by natural scientists, a person seeks relationships that are "unhistorical, immutable, or commonplace"
 Ferdinand Tönnis described the two common types of human organizations as the gameshafts and Presented to Gesellschaft
 toniz ne avadharana or saamaajik kriya kii vaastaviktaa ke kshetron ke bich ek spasht rekha khinchi: pehle vaale ke saath hamen swatahsiddh or nigamanaatmak tareeke se vyavhaar karnaa chahie, jabaki duusare se prayogsiddh or ek aagamanaatmak tareeke se

 In Austria and later America, Alfred Schutz developed social phenomenology, which later brought about social constructionism

 These youths were having a lot of difficulty in collecting funds for a party called Hindustan Republican Association established by the revolutionaries
 angrezon ke dar se koi inhen chandaa detaa na tha or yuvakon ke apane gharon kii mali haalat acchhee na thi
 Eventually, they adopted the method of revolutionaries of Ireland and with the intention of raising money for the party, the first robbery took place on the night of 25 December 1924 in Bamrauli which was led by Bismil
 
 The party made plans to loot the government treasury only after some specific amount was not found in the dacoities that were put up in Bamrauli, Bichpuri and Dwarkapur

 Raman scattering or the Raman effect is about the flexible distribution of photon particles
 isaki khoj prasiddh bhartiya vaigyanik shri si ve raman ne kii thi
 According to Raman effect, when a monochromatic light passes through liquids and solids, the light of some other characters of very low intensity is seen along with the incident light in it

 Initially Raman passed through the purple light beam Punj, obtained by passing the sunlight through a violet filter
 nirgat prakaash punj mukhyatah to bangnee rang kaa hi tha, parantu ise hare filter se gujaarne par isamen bahut kam pariman main hari kirnon kaa astitv bhi dekhne main aayaa
 The Raman effect is also important for understanding the internal structure of chemical compounds

 On the occasion of National Science Day, programs promoting science activities are organized in different regions of India
 60 se zyada vibhinn dravon par prayog dohraane ke baad yah sunishchit ho gaya ki sabhi drav raman spectrum darshaate hai
 Changing the fluid only changes the color of the spectral line transmitted from it
 abhi tak ke prayogon main sirf dekhakar prabhaav kii pushti kii ja rahi thi
 But Raman knew that unless the wavelengths of Raman-lines and their relative intensity were measured, neither the effect could be satisfactorily explained nor recognized in the scientific world
 iske liye unhone ek quartj spectrograph kaa upyog kiya, jiske parimanatmak parinaam march 31, 1928 ke indian jarnal of physics main prakashit hue
 This is a wonderful effect, only a decade after its discovery the internal structure of 2000 chemical compounds was determined

 According to Raman effect, the nature and nature of light changes when it passes through a transparent medium
 yah madhyam thos, drav or gasiy, kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 This phenomenon occurs when the molecules of the medium scatter particles of light energy
 yah usee tarah hota he jaise kairam board par striker gotiyon ko chhitara detaa he
 The intrinsic molecule structure of the medium can be detected by minimal changes in the photon's energy or the nature of light

 At the age of 19, he finished first in the first class and got an MA in Physics

 Raman's devotion to science was so intense that he quit his government job and accepted the post at around half-an-hour in 1917, when he got the offer to be made a professor of physics at the University of Calcutta

 Lord Raley successfully interpreted the blue color of the sky on the basis of light-dispersion from airborne particles, but he considered the blue color of ocean water to be a reflection of the sky in water

 unhone 'nechar ko ek chota lekh is sambandh main bheja or yuva vaigyanikon ke apane dal ke saath prakaash-prakirnan sambandhi apane prayogon main leen ho gaye
 He announced the Raman effect on February 28, 1928, after 7 years of tireless work and light-scattering from hundreds of liquids and solids
 1987 se bharat main yah din rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The Raman effect can be appropriately interpreted only on the basis of quantum theory, where a monochromatic light beam is seen as the flow of particles containing energy
 ye photon jab madhyam ke kanon se takaraate hai to unamem yaa to pratyasth sanghatt hota he jisase anivarytah aaptit aavriti kii hi tarangen utsarjit hoti hai yaa phir apratyasth sanghatt hota he jisase aaptit vikiranon se adhik tarangadairdhya kii spectrumi rekhaaen bhi praapt ho sakati hai or kam tarangadairdhya kii spectrumi rekhaaen bhi
 The process of radiation received from unpredictable collisions is called Raman scattering and the resulting spectral lines are called 'raman lines'
 bhautikeevidon kaa prabhavi aujaar shuruuaati daur main raman prabhaav kaa upyog bhautikeevidon dwaara shodh adhyayanon main kiya gaya
 In the first 7 years, more than 700 scientific research papers were presented on the basis of this effect

 Then gradually physicists started losing interest in this new technique
 par tab tak rasayanagyon ke bich ek vishleshnatak aujaar ke rup main yah takanic lokapriy hone lagi thi
 Every substance has its own specific spectrum as a tool of chemists
 atah padaarth ko nasht kiye bina mishranon kaa bhi rasinic vishleshan is takanic dwaara kiya ja saktaa tha or padaarth carbonic ho yaa acarbonic uske hastakshar raman spectrum main pahachaane ja sakate the
 Also the presence of their relative magnitude could be estimated by comparing the intensity of the spectral lines
 yah ek vyapak takanic thi or iskaa upyog dravon ke atirikt gaison or thoson ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 But after World War II, due to the developments in sensitive detectors and electronics, scientists began to find infrared spectrometry simpler than Raman spectrometry and the trend towards applications of Raman effect decreased somewhat
 kintu lesar kii khoj ke baad 1960 se raman prabhaav phir se vaigyanik anveshakon main lokapriy ho gaya
 The most difficult problem in detecting the Raman effect was that the Raman lines were very weak, so a very strong light source was required for their detection
 lesar ne na keval aisa atyant teevr prakaash strot pradaan kiya varan prakirnit prakaash main aise nae prabhaav pravartit kiye jinhone raman spectrummiti main nae aayam jod die
 As a result, many variations of Raman spectroscopy developed
 inamen jin mul sankalpanaaon kaa upyog kiya gaya he unamem sugrahita vruddhi ke liye prishthvardhit raman, sthanik vibhedan main sudhaar ke liye raman microscopy or atyant vishisht soochna prapti ke liye rejonence raman mukhya hai
 Many different Raman spectrum techniques have been developed with the integration of these concepts
 furier roopantaran takneekon or dota prabandhan ke liye computaron kaa anuprayog jud jane ke baad 1980 ke dashak ke uttarardh se vyavsaayik raman spectrummapi uplabdh ho gaye or ab koi bhi kshetra raman prabhaav ke anuprayogon se achoota nahin rahaa he
 The Raman effect provides the most effective technique wherever a particle-specific particle can be identified and quickly extracted without damaging the sample
 abhinav raman spectrummiti ke kuch anuprayog neeche die gaye hai : The applications of Raman effect have been increasing with time and this shows the importance of the legacy of Raman effect in the 21st century

 The Allahabad inscription mentions the title 'dharm-bandhu' for him because of his services to the cause of religion

 His Buddhist scholar Vasubandhu's patronage and acceptance of Mahendra's request, Ceylon's King's statement to build a Buddhist monastery in Bodh Gaya proves that he respects other religions

 The movement of individuals, families or other categories of people from one section of society to another is called social mobility
 is gati ke parinamswaroop us samaaj main us vyakti yaa parivaar kii dusron ke saapeksh saamaajik sthiti badal jaataa he
 Social mobility refers to a person moving from one place to another
 jab ek sthaan se vyakti duusare sthaan ko jaataa he to use ham saadharantaya aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main gatisheel hone kii kriya maanate hai
 But this kind of mobility has no significance in sociological studies
 samajashastreey adhyayan main gatishiltaa se taatpary ek saamaajik vyavastha main ek sthiti se duusare sthiti ko paa lene se he jiske falswaroop is stareekrut saamaajik vyavastha main gatisheel vyakti kaa sthaan unchaa uthta he va neeche chalaa jaataa he
 To rise from one place to another, which is higher than that, is undoubtedly mobility
 saral shabdon main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki samajashaastra main saamaajik gatishiltaa kaa abhipraay he kisi vyakti, samooh yaa shrenee kii pratishtha main parivartan
 Often this type of mobility is broadly referred to by changes in business sector and social class
 aksar saamaajik gatishiltaa ko is samaaj main mukt yaa pichhadepan kaa dyotak mana jaataa he
 The study of social mobility also includes rates of mobility, and placement of the person
 is sandarbh main ek peedi se duusare peedi ke saamaajik sandarbh ke tahat parivaar ke sadsy kaa aadan-pradaan yaa unchaa uthanaa va neeche girnaa shaamil he
 SM Lipset and r Bendix believed that social mobility is necessary for the ownership of industrial society
 je ech gold thorp ne england main saamaajik gatishiltaa kii charchaa karte hue iske teen mahatvapurn visheshtaon kii baat kii he- P
 Sorokin mentions the following two types of social mobility - jab ek vyakti kaa sthaanantaran ek hi str par ek samooh se duusare samooh main hota he to use kshaitij saamaajik gatishiltaa kehete he
 In this type of mobility, the position of the person remains the same, only the place changes
 udhaaharan ke liye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki sarkari daftaron main kai baar rutin tabadale hote hai jisamen ek shikshak jo ek shahar main padhaa rahe the, unhen us shahar se tabadalaa kar duusare shahar main bhej diya jaataa he
 Similarly, the sending of a soldier working in the army from one place to another is a routine transfer without any promotion
 jab kisi vyakti ko ek pad se upar yaa neeche kii sthiti par kaam karne ke liye kaha jaataa he to vah lambavat saamaajik gatishiltaa kehalaati he
 For example, promotion of a teacher to make him a principal and a subedar to be promoted to the army and giving him the rank of captain are examples of vertical social mobility
 lambavat saamaajik gatishiltaa main agar pad main unnati ho sakati he to pad main giravat bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 For example, it is also possible to remove a captain from the post of Captain and make him a Subedar who can be considered as an example of vertical social mobility
 lambavat saamaajik gatishiltaa ke do up prakaar hai- This type of mobility is a sub-type of vertical social mobility where there is a promotion or promotion in one direction
 padonnati ke baad ek skool shikshak kaa principal banaaya janaa tathaa ek sena ke jawan kaa soobedaar ke pad se captain banaaya janaa lambavat uparimukhi gatishiltaa ke udhaaharan hai
 It is also a sub-type of vertical social mobility but it tends to decline in rank rather than promotion
 agar ek principal ko shikshak pad par kaam karne ke liye kaha jaay or isi prakaar ek sena ke jawan ko capten se hataakar hawaldaar bana diya jaye to ye udhaaharan hai lambavat adhomukhi gatishiltaa ke
 Thus social mobility has mainly discussed these two types
 brum tathaa seljanik ne pratishthatmak upaagam ke dwaara donon vastunishth tathaa aatmanishth upaagam ke vibhinn pahaluon par saamaajik sthiti main parivarttan kaa adhyayan kiye jane par bal diya he
 He said that it has also been described in many sociological studies
 ek parivaar main bhi pita or putr ke bich ke vyavsaay se sambandhit donon ke padon main antar paye jate hai
 This type of promotion can be called hereditary mobility if the son's occupational position is relatively higher than his father's and later that son's son's position also becomes higher than his father's
 is prakaar vyavsaayik kshetra main jo padon main tarakkee aati he uskaa adhyayan kar uske jivan-vritti main gatishiltaa kaa samajashastreey adhyayan pratishthatmak upaagam ke aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he
 It also becomes easy to tell the rates of mobility and direction of a family in its lifetime
 kingsle davis ne saamaajik gatishiltaa ke adhyayan main jati tathaa varg se sambandhit padon main parivarttan kaa adhyayan kiya he
 He believed that caste and class are two important examples of the study of social mobility
 jahaan jati main gatishiltaa nahin hoti he vahiin varg main gatishiltaa paayi jaati he
 In the Indian context, MN Srinivas has studied the dynamics of caste in detail through the concept of culturalisation
 unka yah maananaa tha ki jati me saamaajik sthiti yon to sabhi kii janm se nirdhaarit hoti he jo sthaayee hoti he parantu pratishthatmak upaagam ke aadhaar par kai nimna jati ke log apni sthiti ko upar uthaane ke liye kai tareekon kaa istemaal karte hai taaki ve ucch jati ke logon ke samakaksh aa saken
 Thus, an attempt to elevate their status is often found among people belonging to lower castes
 unhone yah paaya ki nimna jati ke log aksar unchi jati ke logon ke vyavhaar se tathaa prachlit saanskrithik niyamon ke anusaran ko apanaakar apni sthiti ko upar uthaanaa chaahate hai
 The castes which did not have the practice of Upanayana rites before, want to elevate their status through this rite
 nimna jati ke logon ne yah bhi paaya ki unchi jati ke log kai dharmik anushthan ke saath-saath niraabhish bhojan bhi nahin karte
 The lower caste people also began to observe religious rituals by bringing in Niramish food to bring themselves closer to the upper caste and thus began to attempt to bring themselves closer to the upper caste by changing rituals
 
 is prakriya ko em en shrinivas ne 'samskruthikaran' kaha he
 But many other sociologists have held that through culturalisation there is no vertical mobility in the place of caste, rather the lower caste feel that their reputation has changed and probably because of the idea of changing their reputation most of the following The people of caste are trying to bring about this kind of change in their behavior
 nihsandeh yah kaha ja saktaa he ki saamaajik gatishiltaa kii dharna se jati main jo parivarttan aayen hai usamen shiksha, aay tathaa peshey main badlaav kaa hona ek mahatvapurn kaaran he or inkaa samajashastreey adhyayan kar sahi sthiti kii pahchaan karne main is avadharana kaa yogadan kaaphi mahatvapurn hai

 In the human body, the heart is usually located in the middle of the chest, some of the largest part of the heart is to the left and below the breast bone,)
 The heart is usually left and felt, because the left heart is more powerful than the left lung
 The right lung is smaller than the heart, because the heart surrounds most of the left semi-thorax
 Blood in the heart reaches through the coronary circulation and is passed through a sac
 Var is covered with what is called the peri-cardium, it surrounds the lungs
