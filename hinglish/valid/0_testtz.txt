 The Japanese approach, however, is the most different, even unique
 saanskrithik bhinnataayen, antarrashtriya vyapaarik vaartaon main chaar prakaar kii samasyaon ko janm detii hai, nimna staron par: Sequence is important; The problems on the list downstream are serious because they are more subtle
 udhaaharan ke liye, do vaartakar turant dhyaan denge agar ek japani bol rahaa he or doosraa german
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan, ek anuvadak ko kaam par rakhane yaa ek aam tritiy bhashaa main baat karne se saral kiya ja saktaa he yaa phir yah kisi bhashaa ko seekhney jitna mushkil ho saktaa he
 Regardless of the solution, the problem is clear
 saanskrithik bhinnata amaukhik vyavhaar he, duusari taraf, yah lagbhag hameshaa hamaari jaagrukta ke prishth main chipa hota he
 We can say that in a face-to-face negotiation, participants take and give a lot more information, non-verbally - and in a more subtle way
 kuch visheshgyon kaa tark he ki yah jaankaree, maukhik jaankaree se kahin adhik mahatvapurn he
 Almost all this signal goes below the level of our consciousness
 jab videshi bhagidaaron ke amaukhik sanket bhinn hote hai, to vaartakar use galat rup main samajhane ke bahut nazadik hote hai or aise main ve galati ke prati jaagruk bhi nahin hote
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek french graahak lagaataar vyavdhaan utpann karata he, to americanyon ko bahut asahaj mahasoos hota he bina yah dekh ki vastav main aisa kyon he
 In this way, interpersonal confrontation, often affecting business relationships, remains invisible and, consequently, cannot be rectified
 Differences in values and thinking and decision making process are hidden deep and hence they become difficult to diagnose due to which they are not treated properly
 These differences are discussed below, beginning with language and nonverbal behavior
 antarrashtriya vaartaon main anuwaad samasyaayein aksar mahatvapurn hoti hai
 And, when languages are linguistically isolated, more problems should be anticipated
 Global settlement negotiations in particular can be a challenging task
 aksar angreji bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin mej par ise adhikansh adhikariyon dwaara duusari bhashaa ke rup main bolaa ja saktaa he
 In fact, native speakers of England, India and America often have trouble understanding each other
 antarrashtriya sahabhaagitaaon main main sateek anuwaad, ek lakshya he jise lagbhag kabhi praapt nahin kiya gaya he
 In addition, variations of language are sometimes used in interesting ways
 videshi deshon main kai varisht adhikari thodi angrezi bolte or samajhate hai, lekin apni "majboot" deshi bhashaa main bolnaa or ek dubhashiya prayog karnaa pasand karte hai
 Thus, we have seen a senior Russian interlocutor asking questions in Russian
 dubhashiya ne phir apane america samakaksh ke liye prashn ko anudit kiya
 When the interpreter was speaking, the American's attention was towards the interpreter
 haalanki, roosi kii nigahon kii disha america kii taraf thi
 Therefore, the Russian could notice the facial expressions and nonverbal reactions of the American with great attention and without any interference
 iske atirikt, jab america bol rahaa tha, to varisht roosi ke paas pratikriya dene kaa duguna samay tha
 Because he understood English, he could formulate his response during the translation process
 pratikriya dene ke is atirikt samay kaa ek ranneetik samjhauta vaarta main kya mahatv he? ek ucch daanv vaali vyapaar vaarta main apane sheersh str ke samakaksh kii amaukhik pratikriyaaon par dhyanpurvak gaur karne main sakasham hone ke kya phaayde hai? sahaj rup se kaha jaae to, americanyon ke liye dwibhashavad ek aam lakshan nahin he or isliye antarrashtriya vaanijya main bhashaa main ucch kaushal vaale pratiyogiyon ko ek prakritik laabh hasil hota he
 In addition, a common complaint heard from US managers relates to discussions among foreign clients and partners in their native language
 spasht rup se, ise ashishtataa samajha jaataa he or aksar america vaartakaron dwaara is videshi baatcheet main kuch ashubh gun dekhe jane kii sambhaavna rahati he - "ve yojana bana rahe hai yaa rahasy bataa rahe hai
 "this is a frequent American mistake
 aisi aapasi charchaaon kaa saamaanya prayojan, anuwaad kii samasya ko sudhaarna hota he
 For example, one Korean may bow to another Korean and ask "what did he say?" Or, mutual discussion may be related to a disagreement between members of the foreign party
 donon hi paristhitiyon ko americanyon dwaara sakaaratmak sanket ke rup main dekha janaa chahie - arthath, anuwaad ko sateek samajhnaa, sahabhaagita kii kshamta ko badhaata he or isamen kotahi aksar aantarik asahmati ko janm detii hai
 But since most Americans speak only one language, both situations will not be appreciated
 By the way, it is advisable for the people of other countries to give a short description of the contents of their first few mutual discussions to the Americans so that no unpleasant perception develops
 lekin, anuwaad or dubhashiyon se pare bhi bhashaa ke str par kuch samasyaayein hai
 Pseudo-dialogue figures are informative
 adhyayan main, 15 samskritiyon ke vaartakaron ke maukhik vyavhaar ko video tepe kiya gaya
 The numbers in the section of Exhibit 1 represent the percentage of statements that are classified into each listed category
 arthath, japani vaartakaron dwaara die gaye bayanon ke 7 pratishat ko vaade, 4 pratishat ko dhamkee, 7 pratishat ko siforeeshon, ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya
 The verbal bargaining practices used by negotiators during pseudo-negotiations proved surprisingly similar in all cultures
 Negotiations in all 15 cultures were primarily built on information-cooperation strategies - questions and self-disclosures
 Note that Israelis are at the low end in the order of self-disclosure
 unka 30 pratishat sabhi 15 samoohon main nunatam tha, jiskaa taatpary tha ki ve jaankaree dene main sabase adhik anicchhuk the
 Overall, however, the method of verbal strategies used was surprisingly similar across diverse cultures
 pradarsh 1 par jaaen, 15 samskritiyon main maukhik vaarta ranneeti, : Anthropologist Ray L
 Birdwichel demonstrated that less than 35% of the message in a dialogue is conveyed by the spoken word while the other 65% is communicated nonverbal
 albert mehrabian, ek UCLA manovaigyanik ne bhi aamane-saamne kii sahabhaagita main jahaan se arth upajte hai uski padvyakhya kii he
 He reports: beshak, kuch log sateek pratishat ke saath hila-hawali kar sakate hai, lekin hamaara kaam is dharna kaa bhi samarthan karata he ki amaukhik vyavhaar mahatvapurn hai - chizon ko kaise kaha jaataa he yah aksar is baat se adhik mahatvapurn hota he ki kya kaha gaya
 Exhibit 2 provides an analysis of some linguistic aspects and nonverbal behavior of 15 videotape groups, that is, how things are said
 haalanki ye prayaas keval, is prakaar ke vyavhaar vishleshan kii sataha ko kharonchte hai, ve tab bhi paryaapt saanskrithik matbhedon ke sanket uplabdh karaate hai
 Note that, once again, the Japanese are at or near the end of this sequence on almost every dimension listed in behavior
 in 15 samoohon main unke chehre kii anymanskta or chhuan nunatam he
 Only the North Chinese used the term more often, and only the Russians used more silent periods than the Japanese
 pradarsh 2 par jaaen, 15 samskritiyon main bhashaa or amaukhik vyavhaar ke bhashaai pahalu : a comprehensive test of the data in Exhibits 1 and 2 reveals a more meaningful conclusion: differentiation across cultures is found in comparing linguistic aspects of language and nonverbal behaviors compared to considering the oral content of the dialogue
 udhaaharan ke liye, pradarsh 1 kii tulana main pradarsh 2 main japaniyon or braziliyon ke bich ke vishaal antar par gaur karen
 Additional details of specific aspects of each of the 15 cultural groups videotaped are further
 nishchit rup se, vyaktigat samskritiyon ke bich sankhyikeey mahatvapurn antar ko bade namoonon ke bina taiyaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 lekin, bataae gai saanskrithik vibhinnataaon par sankshipt vichaar karnaa sarthak he
 Japan In line with most descriptions of Japanese negotiation behavior, the result of this analysis shows that their style of engagement is the least aggressive
 Threats, orders and warnings are discouraged in favor of more positive promises, recommendations and commitments
 unki vinamr samvaad style kaa vishesh sanket, unke nahin or tum ke nune prayog or chehre ke haavbhaav se miltaa he, saath hi saath chuppi bhari avadhiyon se bhi
 Perhaps a more interesting aspect of Korea analysis is the contrast of the Asian dialogue style
 non-asians often make generalizations about Eastern countries; The findings demonstrate that this is a mistake
 japani kii tulana main korian vaartakaron ne kaaphi adhik dand or aadesh kaa prayog kiya
 The Koreans used the word no more than three times as much as the Japanese and intervened
 iske alaava, korian vaartakaron ke madhya khamoshi kii koi avadhi nahin thi
 China 
 The behavior of the interlocutors of North China was most notable in asking questions
 Of course, 70 percent of the statements made by Chinese negotiators were classified as information exchange strategies
 unke vyavhaar ke anya pahalu japanyon ke kaaphi samaan the, vishesh rup se nahin or tum or khamosh avadhi kaa prayog
 Taiwan
 The behavior of the business people in Taiwan was quite different from that of China and Japan but similar to that of Korea
 chehre par dekhne ke samay main taiwan par chini asaadhaaran the - ausat rup se 20 yaa 30 minute lagbhag
 kisi anya asian samooh kii tulana main unhone kam sawaal poocha or adhik jaankaree pradaan kii 
 Russia
 The Russian style was quite different from any other European group and, in fact, was quite similar to the Japanese style in many ways
 unhone nahin or tum kaa kam hi istemaal kiya or kisi bhi anya samooh kii tulana main khamoshi bhari avadhi kaa sabase adhik istemaal kiya
 Only Japanese see less facial expressions and only Chinese ask most questions
 israel israeli vaartakaron kaa vyavhaar teen maamalon main vishisht tha
 As mentioned above, he used the lowest percentage of private-disclosures, apparently holding his card relatively
 Alternatively, the highest percentage of promises and recommendations were used, making unusually heavy use of these persuasion strategies
 5 pratishat ke saath ve pramanik apil ke pratishat ke paimaane par ant main the jahaan pratiyogiyon kii peshkash kaa sarvaadhik sandarbh tha
 Perhaps most importantly, Israeli negotiators interrupt each other more often than negotiators of any other party
 darasal, is mahatvapurn amaukhik vyavhaar ke liye hi sambhavit rup se unhen "dhakelu" ke rudh praaroop se nawaaza jaataa he jo aksar americanyon dwaara unke samjhauta vaarta ke israeli bhagidaaron kaa varnan ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Germany It is difficult to characterize the behavior of the Germans as they place themselves in the middle in almost all order
 haalanki, german, nijee-khulaase ke maamle main ucch pratishat ke saath tathaa prashnon ke maamle main kam pratishat ke saath asaadhaaran the
 The behavior of British negotiators in the United Kingdom was remarkably similar to the American people in all respects
 zyaadaatar british vaartakaron main samjhauta vaarta karne ke maamle main sahi tareeke or galat tareeke kii ek majboot bhaavana hoti he
 Protocol is very important
 spain samjhauta vaarta ke spanish drushtikon ke liye diga shaayad ek acha roopak he, jo hamaare aankade main dikhataa he
 When you make a phone call in Madrid, the response usually from the other end is not a hola, but rather, a dig
 isliye isamen aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki video tepe vaarta main bhi spanish ne vaise hi kisi anya samooh kii apeksha, adeshon ke sarvaadhik pratishat kaa istemaal kiya or apekshaakrit kam jaankaree pradaan kii 
 iske alaava, kisi bhi anya samooh kii tulana main unhone aksar adhik baadha utpann kii or unhone nahin or tum shabd kaa kaaphi prayog kiya
 France The style of the French negotiators was perhaps the most aggressive of all groups
 vishesh rup se, unhone dhamkee or chetavaniyon ke sarvaadhik pratishat kaa istemaal kiya
 Compared to other groups, he used intervention, face-to-face and not and you too often, and a French negotiator also touched his partner's hand during a pseudo-negotiation
 brazil
 brazili udyog jagat ke log, french or spanish ke samaan kaaphi aakraamak the
 Among all groups, they used the second highest percentage of orders
 ausat rup se, brazilian ne 30 minute kii samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan 42 baar nahin shabd, 90 baar tum shabd kaa prayog kiya or ek-duusare ke haath ko 5 baar chuaa
 chehre par nigahen bhi adhik thim
 Mexico
 The patterns of Mexican behavior in our negotiation negotiations have been good reminders of the dangers of regional or language group generalization
 unke donon maukhik or amaukhik vyavhaar, apane latin america yaa mahadwipiya chachere bhaaiyon se kaaphi bhinn the
 Actually, people in Mexico answer the telephone more efficiently
 In many respects, the behavior of Mexican negotiators was very similar to that of the United States
 french-bhashi canadow french bhashi canadai ne apane mahadwipiya bhaaiyon ke kaaphi samaan vyavhaar kiya
 Like the French negotiators, they also used a higher percentage of threats and warnings and had relatively more interference and eye contact
 is tarah kii mail-milaap kii aakraamak style, kuch asian samooh yaa angreji bhashi canadai sahit anya angrezi bolne waalon kii shantimay style se mail nahin khaati he
 English-speaking Canadians The Canadians who spoke English as the first language used the lowest percentage of aggressive tactics of persuasion among all 15 groups
 Perhaps, as dialogue researchers suggest, such stylistic differences seed the inner-ethnic race, as seen in Canada over the years
 antarrashtriya vaarta ke sambandh main, angrezi bhashi canadaayiyon ne canada ke pramukh vyapaarik saajhedaaron america or japan, donon kii tulana main zaahir taur par hastkshepon or nahin kaa adhik prayog kiya
 United States of america 
 Like the Germans and the British, the Americans live in the middle for most of the order
 anya logon kii tulana main unhone beshak ek-duusare ko kam baadhit kiya, lekin unamem yahi ekmaatr fark tha
 Variations in these cultures are quite complex and this material by itself should not be used to predict the behavior of foreign counterparts
 Instead, special care should be taken with respect to the so-called threats of the orthodox format
 It is important here to be aware of such variations, so that Japanese silence, Brazilian "no, no 


," or French intimidation are not misunderstood
 charchaa kii gai 15 samskritiyon ke alaava, neeche bumadhya kshetra main samjhauta vaarta ke drushtikon par ek ansh he
 “the Mediterranean culture is completely warm-hearted

 It is difficult to clearly explain settlement negotiations in particular deals or at particular stages of negotiation
 kuch kshetron main, saude ko 'snehan' kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In fact, this question of 'lubrication' is important for some cultures in Mediterranean countries
 ise ek saamaanya abhyaas ke rup main dekha jaataa he or isamen 'rishwatakhori' kaa pratikaarak charitra nahin he
 The approach to negotiating settlement in these cultures requires the discipline that we were discussing; And even then one should be aware of the need for lubrication
 As any respectable Western company would like to engage in the practice of bribery, the need is to obtain a local agency and ensure that that agency is handling lubrication
 " The four managerial values - fairness, competition, equality, and punctuality, which are firmly held by most Americans, often appear to lead to misunderstandings and bad feelings in international trade negotiations
 "america, antim bindu or thande, kathor tathyon par par aadhaarit nirnay lete hai
 "" Americans do not play nepotism
 " "arthshaastra or pradarshan kaa mulya he, logon kaa nahin
" "vyapaar, vyapaar he
 "such statements well reflect American views of the importance of fairness
 samjhauta vaarta ke vishay par ekmaatr sarvaadhik safal kitaab, gating tu yas, ko videshi or america, donon pathakon ke liye atyadhik sifarish kii jaati he
 Foreigners will not only learn about negotiation but, perhaps more importantly, learn what the American people think about negotiations

 In most places of the world, especially in group-oriented, high-context cultures, personality and substance are not separate issues and cannot be separated

 Experts point out that businesses in the growing "chinese Commonwealth" do not grow beyond the limits and ties of rigid family control

 At least 40 people from each culture's industry played the same buyer-seller game and negotiated a settlement on the prices of three products
 Depending on the final agreement, the "negotiation pie" can be further enhanced through cooperation, before it is split between buyer and seller

 Americans have little understanding of the Japanese practice of paying full respect to buyer's wishes
 america main chijen aise kaam nahin karatin hai
 American sellers treat American buyers more as an equal, and the egalitarian values of American society support this behavior
 in nishkarshon main pratibimbit, vyaktvaad or pratiyogita par diya jane vaala america jor, girt homested ke kaary se kaaphi sangat rakhata he, jo sanket detaa he ki vyaktivaadee paimaane par americanyon ne anya sabhi saanskrithik samoohon kii tulana main ucchtam ank praapt kiye
 iske alaava, dekha gaya he ki vyaktvaad / samashtiwad ke mulyon ne kai anya deshon main samjhauta vaarta ke vyavhaaron ko sidhe prabhavit kiya he
 Finally, not only do Japanese buyers get more results from American buyers, but compared with American sellers, Japanese sellers also get a larger share of the commercial pie
 dilachasp rup se, jab in parinaamon ko dikhaaya jaataa he to kaaryakari seminaron main america abhi bhi aksar america vikreta kii bhoomika pasand karte hai
 In other words, even though American sellers make less profit than Japanese, many American managers apparently prefer less profit if that profit stems from the same division of a combined profit

 For example, an American department store executive who was traveling to Japan to buy six different consumer products for his chain expressed remorse that negotiations for the first product took a full week
 sanyukt rajya america main, is tarah kii ek kharid ko ek dopaher bhar main antim rup de diya jaataa he
 So, according to his calculations, he felt that it would take six weeks in Japan to complete his purchase
 He considered raising purchase prices in an attempt to speed up the process
 lekin isse pehle ki vah is tarah ke riyaayat main sakasham ho, japani sheeghra hi sirf teen dinon main baaki paanch anya utpaadon par bhi sahamat ho gaye

 duusari taraf, ek japani vyapaaree ke liye, ek vyapaarik samjhauta vaarta, ek lambii avadhi ke parsparik laabh ke lakshya ke liye vyapaarik sambandhon ko viksit karne kaa samay he
 Economic issues are a reference to dialogue, not content
 Thus, the resolution of any one issue is not really so important
 yadi ek baar ek vyavhaarya, saamanjasypurna vyapaarik sambandh sthapit ho jaae to aise vivaran khud-ba-khud hal ho jaayenge
 or, jaisaa ki khudara vastuon ke kharidaar ke maamle main upar hua, ek baar jab sambandh sthapit ho gaya - pehle samjhaute se chihnit - anya "vivaran" shighrata se hal ho gaye
 American bargainers should anticipate such a holistic approach common in Asian cultures and be prepared to negotiate conciliation on all issues in an apparently disorganized order
 Progress in negotiations should not be measured by how many issues have been resolved
 balki, americanyon ko vyapaarik sambandhon kii gunvattta ko naapane kii koshish kerani chahie

 Adam Smith is primarily known for his two compositions - yah upwas saptaah ke pratham diwas somvaar ko rakhaa jaataa he
 This fast is kept for Som i
e
 Chandra or Shivji
 ek samay shri bhootnath mahadev ji mrityulok main vihaar kii ichha karke mata parvati ke saath padhaare
 Amravati city of Vidarbha country, which was full of all happiness, passed there
 There was a very beautiful Shiva temple by the king, where he started living
 ek baar parvati ji ne chausar khalane kii ichha kii
 Then on the entrance of the priest in the temple, Mataji asked who would win in this contest? So the Brahmin said that Mahadev ji
 lekin parvati ji jeet gayin
 He then cursed the Brahmin for being a leper in the crime of lying
 kai dinon ke pashchaat devloak kii apsaraaen, us mandir main padhaarin or use dekhakar kaaran poocha
 pujari ne nibasancoch sab bataaya
 Then the Apsaras tied the mantra and told them to keep sixteen Monday vows
 vidhi poochne par unhone vidhi bhi uparoktanusaar bataayi
isse shivaji kii krupa se saare manorath purna ho jate hai
 Then the nymphs went to heaven
 brahman ne somvaaron kaa vrath kar ke rogamukt hokar jivan vyateet kiya
 After a few days when Parvati ji came to know, Parvati ji asked Karan to get rid of her disease
 Then the Brahmin told the whole story
 Then Parvati ji also did the same fast and her wish was fulfilled
 unke ruthe putr kartikeya ji mata ke aagyaakaari hue
 parantu kartikeya ji ne apane vichaar parivartan kaa kaaran poocha
 tab parvati ji ne vahi katha unhen bhi bataayi
 tab swami kartikeya ji ne bhi yahi vrath kiya
 His wish was also fulfilled
 unase unke mitra brahman ne puch kar yahi vrath kiya
 Then the Brahmin went abroad and went to a kingdom at Swayamvara
 vahaan raja ne pran kiya tha, ki ek hathini ek maala, jis ke gale main daalegi, vah apni putree usee se vivaah karegaa
 There, by Shiva's grace, Hathini put the garland in the neck of the Brahmin
 raja ne usase apni putree kaa vivaah kar diya
 On asking that girl, the Brahmin told her the story
 Then that girl also fasted and got a beautiful son
 baad main us putr ne bhi yahi vrath kiya or ek vruddh raja kaa rajya paaya
 When the new king went to worship on Monday, his wife did not leave due to the ascendancy
 puja purna hone par akaash vaani hui, ki rajan is kanya ko chhod de, anyathaa tera sarvanaash ho jaye ga
ant main usne rani ko rajya se nikaal diya
 The queen arrived in another city crying hungry thirsty
 She found an old lady with whom she use ek budhi aurat mili jo dhaage banaati thi
 She started working with him, but on the second day when she started selling the thread, suddenly there was a strong wind and all the threads flew away, then the mistress got angry and fired her
 phir rote phirte vah ek taili ke ghar pahaunchi taili ne use rakh liya par bhandar ghar me jate hi tel ke bartan girgaye or tel bah gaya to us taili ne use ghar se nikaal diya
 In this way, after being evacuated from all places, she reached a beautiful forest, when the water grew from there to drink water, the pond was dried and there was some water left which was full of keto

 Therefore, to act according to this nature is to respect God's will and to not act accordingly is to disobey God

 shaasha kaa dharm ajna dena or shasit kaa kartavya us ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 Similarly, the religion of father, husband and elder brother has to be ordered and the duty of son, wife and younger brother is to follow orders

 marxvaadi vichaardhaara ke antargat bhrant chetana ko aisi avasthaa mana jaataa he jisamen sarvhaara varg ko swayan yah gyaat nahin hota ki uske hit vastav main kis raajnneetik dal-samooh, vichaardhaara se jude hue hai or itihaas main uski vaastavik bhoomika kya he
 They live under the influence of an ideology that is against their interests
 bhrant chetana paidaa karke shaasha varg sarvhaara ke utpeedan or shoshan kii sthitiyaan banaaye rakhata he or sarvhaara swayan us shoshan ko sahi maanane lagata he
 Marx wrote in his famous work Communist Manifesto that the ideas of the ruling class of any period are the ruler-views
 yani sattarudh varg ke vichaar hi sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee vichaar ban jate hai
 This social consciousness and influential ideas are also related to illusory consciousness because the proletariat adopts the consciousness developed by the ruling class in place of the development of private consciousness
 marks ke anusaar yah thopi hui arthath juthi chetana hoti he
 Over time, the proletariat begins to understand that the consciousness that the ruling class has created for reality is not in line with their class interests and then in place of the illusory consciousness, real class-consciousness is born
 is avadharana kaa vishleshan varg-chetana or vichaardhaara kii vyakhya ke antargat bhi kiya jaataa he
 Class consciousness is the condition in which the proletariat considers itself a member of a particular class
 marks ne is varg-chetana ko 'class in itaself' or 'class faar itaself' kii shreniyon main vibhakt kiya he
 The first category in this is the condition in which a social group is a part of a common economic position and it accepts that position
 sthiti ko sweekaar karne or pratirodh na karne kii avasthaa ke nirmaan main bhrant chetana kaa sabase bada yogadan hota he, jabaki class faar itaself varg chetana kii vah dasha he jisamen sarvhaara kisi bhi prakaar kii bhrant chetana va vichaardhaara se mukt hokar vaastavik varg-chetana kaa vikaas karata he or vah apane aitihaasik shoshan ke bare main sajag ho jaataa he
 According to Marx, this change is subject to special physical conditions in which capitalism is predominant and due to capitalism, the production system becomes collective and due to this collectivity the idea of individualism is no longer important in the eyes of the proletariat
 marks ke granthon main bhrant chetana shabd kaa vyavhaar nahin miltaa
 Actually, Engels, an integral ally of Marx, first used it
 par marks dwaara prayukt vichaardhaara tathaa 'panya-puja' shabdon ke arth isi ke nikat maane jate hai
 Marx originally presented an objective notion of class which was based on the objective interpretation of the system based on the economic relations of society
 kisi bhi vyakti ke saamaajik varg kaa nirdhaaran samaaj main maujuud utpaadan evam sampattigat sambandhon ke aadhaar par hota he
 But despite being a member of a social class, a person has many personal characteristics and personal beliefs which are based on the forms of thoughts, entertainment and identities
 ye manogat dharanaayen hi kisi vyakti ko aisa vaicharik dhaanchaa uplabdh karaati hai jiske antargat vyakti samaaj main apni bhoomika ko samajhataa he or apane jivan ke prabhavit karne vaali shaktiyon ke bare main raay kaayam karata he
 But in any class-divided society, there exists dialectical relations between the privileged and subordinate classes of the society
 marks ke anusaar samoochaa saamaajik tantra is prakaar kaa hota he ki vah sarvhaara kii chetana main bade vyavasthit tareeke se vaastaviktaa kii galat, vikrut chhaviyaan nirmit karata he
 If this is not done then the exploited section of the society will know the real reasons for their exploitation and will overthrow the system of oppression and oppression
 isliye raajnneeti, dharm, vyapaar, aadhyatm aadi ke str par aisi vyavastha khadi kii jaati he jisase bhrant chetana tathaa vichaardhaaratmak varchasv ko paidaa kiya ja sake
 It is noteworthy that Marx introduced the theory of ideology in his book The German Ideology and described ideology as a medium which helps man to understand his creation and society
 marks ke puure darshan main vichaardhaara ko anya chizon se swatantra nahin balki un par nirbhar bataaya gaya he
 In particular, the nature of ideology depends on physical conditions and production relations in a particular period
 isiilie marks ne apni is rachana main pehle se chale aa rahe bhavvaadi darshan sampradaayon kaa virodh karte hue likhaa : ‘chetana manushya ke saamaajik astitv ko nirdhaarit nahin karti balki saamaajik astitv hi uski chetana kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Along with changing the form of production, new classes and ownership also arise
 ’ marks ke hi shabdon main : ‘hathkarghe vaale samaaj main samant shaasha hote hai jabaki bhaap aadhaarit milon ke vikaas ke baad audyogic poonjipatiyon ke haath main satta aa jaati he
 In this conversion of classes, ideology plays a big role in maintaining the dominance of one class over another and from that it also creates a false consciousness
 ’ Marx developed the concept of commodity worship in his famous book Das Capital
 is avadharana ke madhyam se unhone un sthitiyon kii vyakhya kii he jo panya- utpaadan main lage samaaj main yatharth ko dhundhala, aspasht tathaa bhrampurna banane main yogadan detii hai
 The view and perception of an object is constructed only by its value and the production relations between which that commodity is produced are ignored
 juuton kii silaai ke kaarakaane main bane juute kaa bazaar main keval mulya dekha jaataa he jabaki juute banane vaale majdoor ke shram ko andekha kar diya jaataa he
 According to Marx, this kind of mystification plays an important role in social production and through this, the market-based society exposes the owner-worker relations based on oppression and exploitation on which they themselves depend
 bhrant chetana kii avadharana ko marks dwaara pratipaadit aadhaar evam adhirachana kii saidhaantikiyon se bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 The physical conditions of the society are the foundation and the changes in social relations also take place due to the changes in them
 jabaki adhirachana main shaikshanik, vaidhanik, raajnneetik sansthaaen, mulya, chintan ke tareeke, dharm, vichaardhaaraen or darshanashastra ityadi aate hai
 It is through this that exploitative relations like feudal-peasant, labor-owner etc
 in physical conditions are defended and when all the members of society accept these exploitative ideas present in the superstructure, then it is the form of accepting subjugation of illusory consciousness Is seen in parvarti vichaarkon jaise karl manhim, antonio gramshi, lui alathuse aadi ne vichaardhaara tathaa raajnneetik sansthaaon kaa vistaar se vishleshan kar bhrant chetana ke bare main prakaash daalaa
 The French philosopher Louis Althousse analyzes it as an essential tool of reproduction of labor-force
 alathuse ke anusaar shram shakti kaa punarutpaadan do chizon par nirbhar karata he

 Bertolt Brecht, W
 H
 Auden, Andre Breton, Louise Aragon and philosophers - Antonio Gramsci and Walter Benjamin are perhaps the most famous examples of this modernist Marxism

 Apparently "right-wing" modernists include lewis-ferdinand Salin, Salvador Dali, Windham Louis, William Butler Yates, TS
 Elliot, Ezra Pound, Dutch writer Menno ter Braak and many others

 This is true to some extent in all areas of culture except visual and performing arts

 Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting in the late 1940s revolutionized the ability of all contemporary art that followed him
 To some extent Pollock realized that the journey to the creation of an artwork was as important as the artwork itself

 Other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's success with their own innovative successes
 ek tarah se jackson polak, wilem di kooning, franz cline, mark rothko, philip guston, hans hophman, cliford still, barnet newman, aid rinhard, robert madaravell, peter volks or anya hastiyon ke nawacharon ne unka anusaran karne vaali sabhi kala kii vividhta or kshetra ke pur-dwaar khol die

 During the 1950s and 1960s, a number of directions, such as hard-edge painting and other types of radical eclipses, began to appear in radical art-pioneering fields and in abstract studios in artists' studios as a response against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism
 Clement Greenberg became the voice of postcolonial abstractions when he collaborated in an inspiring exhibition of novel painting in 1964 visiting important art museums throughout the United States
 Color field painting, hard-edged painting, and lyrical abstractions appeared as radical new directions

 The process art inspired by Pollock enabled artists to experiment and use style, material, material, place, time experience and a diverse encyclopedia of plastic and real space
 Nancy Graves, Ronald Davis, Howard Hodgkin, Larry Poones, Janice Kounellis, Bryce Marden, Bruce Naumann, Richard Tuttle, Alan Sarat, Walter Darby Banard, Linda Benglis, Dan Christenson, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Eva Hayes, Keith Sonnier, Richard Serra, Sam Gilliam, Mario Merz, and Peter Reginato were some of the young artists who originated during the last era of modernism who lived in the 1960s Gave birth to the heyday of the art of the final round of the doubt

 By the early 1960s, minimalism emerged as an abstract movement in art that abandoned the idea of relational and subjective painting, the complexity of abstract expressive surfaces, and the polemic skills and emotional euphemisms present in the field of action painting
 Minimalism argued that excessive simplicity could capture all the specific performance required in art
 frank stela jaise chitrakaaron kaa sahyog praapt karne vaala, anya kshetron ke vipareet, chitrakala ke kshetra main atisookshmavaad ek aadhuniktaavaadi aandolan he
 Minimalism is variously considered either a precursor to postmodernism, or itself a postmodern movement

 Hill Foster in his essay entitled The Crooks of Minimalism examines the extent to which Donald Judd and Robert Morris both accept and extend Greenbergist modernism in their published definitions of minimalism
 vah tark dete hai ki atisookshmavaad aadhuniktawaad kaa ek "mrit ant" nahin, balki "aaj bhi vistaar kiye jane vaale uttaradhunik prathaon kaa ek nidarshanatmak badlaav" he
 In the late 1960s Robert pincus-witten coined the term postmodernism to describe minimalist-derived art that contained material and contextual motives that minimalism had discarded
 pinkos-whitten ne eva hes, kith sonier, richard serra kii rachanaaon or robert smithsan, robert morris, evam sol leavit jaise purv atisookshmavaadiyon or bairi le vaa, evam anya hastiyon kii nai rachanaaon ke liye is shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 Minimalists, including Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Carl André, Agnes Martin, John mccracken, and others, continued to produce late-stage modernist painting and sculpture for the remainder of their careers

 Since then, many artists have adopted minimalist and post-minimalist styles and have been labeled "postmodern"

 In the early 20th century, Marcel Duchamp exhibited a urinal as a sculpture
 unhone apni manshaa jaahir karte hue kaha ki log mutralay ko is tarah se dekhte hai maanon yah ek kalakriti ho kyonki unhone kaha ki yah ek kalakriti thi
 He referred to his act as "readymades"

 Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art, among other well-known examples being John Cage's 4'33 "and Rauschenberg's Erased Day Kooning, the 4'33" four-minute thirty-second silence

 Marcel Duchamp famously abandoned "art" in favor of chess
 Art-leading composer David Tudor wrote an article called Reunion that he wrote together with Lovell Cross, which depicts a game of chess in which each move triggers a luminous effect or projection
 ducamp or kej ne krity ke premier par is khel ko khelaa
 Steven Best and Douglas Kelner identify Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns as part of the transitional phase, inspired by Marcel Duchamp, between modernism and postmodernism

 Another trend in the art associated with neo-dada is the use of innumerable different mediums simultaneously

 Groups such as The Living Theater, along with Julian Beck and Judith Malina, collaborated with sculptors and painters to create the atmosphere and fundamentally changed the relationship between the viewer and the exhibitor, particularly in his composition Paradise Now
 Judson Dance Theater and Judson Dancers located at Judson Memorial Church in New York, notably Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Ellen Summers, Sally Grosse, Simone Forty, Deborah Hay, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton and others by Robert Morris, Robert Whitman, John Cage worked closely with artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and engineers such as Billy Kluwer

 During the same period, various art-leading artists created spectacles

 Notable creators of these shows included Alan Capro, Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Robert Whitman

 One of Alan Capro's earliest acts was "happenings in the New York Scene", composed in 1961, when the color was developing
 1958 main capro ne "da ligesi of jackson polak" naamak niabandh prakashit kiya
 In it he calls for a "tangible art" made of everyday materials such as color, chair, food, electricity and fixed light, smoke, water, old socks, dog, film

 kej ke chaatro main fluxs kii sthapana karne vaale sadsy jackson mike lo, al hensen, jorge bract or dick higgins shaamil the
 Fluxus encouraged the aesthetic principle of do-it-yourself and gave importance to simplicity over complexity
 Like Dada before it, Fluxus featured a powerful anti-commercialization stream and an anti-art sensibility that ignored the traditional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice
 fluxs kalakaar uplabdh samagriyon ke saath kaam karne ko praathamikta dete the or apni khud kii rachana kaa nirmaan karte the yaa apane sahyogiyon ke saath nirmaan prakriya main sahyog karte the
 Andreas Hussen criticizes Fluxus' attempts to postmodernism as "either the master-code of postmodernism or the ultimately untouchable art movement - as if it were the best style of postmodernism"
 iske bajaay vah fluxs ko kala-agrani parampara ke bheetar ek pramukh nav-dadawadi ghatana ke rup main dekhte hai
 It demonstrated a major advancement in the development of artistic strategies, although it was an expression of a rebellion against the "administered culture of the 1950s," in which a liberal, friendly modernism served as the theoretical basis of the Cold War

 While postmodernism has been in force since the end of modernism, many theorists and scholars argue that postmodernism persists into the 21st century as well
 kai aadhuniktaavaadiyon kaa maananaa tha ki parampara kaa tyaag karke ve moulik rup se kala nirmaan ke nae tareekon kaa avishkaar kar sakate the
 Arnold Schoenberg abandoned the traditional tonal harmony, the hierarchical system of producing musical compositions that had pioneered music production for at least a decade and a half

 Abstract artists, who call themselves impressionists, as well as Paul Cezanne and Edward Munch, began with the notion that color and shape, not the depiction of the natural world, formed essential features of art

 Just as cars replaced horses, modernist design should abandon the ancient styles and structures that existed from ancient Egypt or the Middle Ages
 In some cases Roop superseded the works
 is mashin soundarya siddhant kaa anusaran karte hue aadhuniktaavaadi dizineron ne aam taur par dizine main sajaavati rupankanon kaa tyaag kar diya or prayukt samagriyon or shuddh rekhikeey roopon par jor dena pasand kiya

 In contrast, in the 20th century, public buildings became vertically oriented and private buildings were established horizontally
 Even today, many aspects of modernist design persist within the mainstream of contemporary architecture, though its previous dogma has provided a more juicy use of decoration, historical quotation, and spatial drama

 Some modernists in literature and visual arts primarily wanted to ignore expectations to make their art more bright or to compel audiences to take the trouble to question their own prejudices

 While most manufacturers attempt to manufacture products that will be marketed through the lure of preferences and adverse effects, high modernists abandon such consumerist approaches to undermine traditional thinking
 Art critic Clement Greenberg explained this theory of modernism in an essay titled avant-garde & Kitsch
 Greenberg labeled consumer culture products as "kitsch" because their design was simply aimed at achieving maximum attractiveness and simultaneously removed any difficult features

 Many modernists saw themselves as apolitical
 Others, eg - TS Elliot, abandoning vast popular culture from a conservative position
 Some also argue that modernism in literature and art served to nurture a transcendent culture that excluded the majority of the population

 In literature this often included the renunciation of explicit plots or characterization in novels, or the creation of poetry that ignored explicit interpretation

 For this reason, many modernists of the post-war generation felt that they were the most important barrier against totalitarianism, the "coal mine informers" whose repression by a government or any other group of expected officials represented a warning

 Celebrities like Bob Dylan, Serge Gainsbourg, and The Rolling Stones, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, James Thurber, TS
 Elyt, Gilloum Apollinaire, Ellen Ginsberg, and others combined popular musical traditions with modernist verses, eclipsing literary instruments derived from them
 The Beatles developed similar lines, composing various modernist musical influences on several albums, while composers such as Frank Zappa, Sid Barrett and Captain Beefheart proved even more experimental
 Modernist devices also appeared in popular cinema and later music videos
 Modernist designs also entered the mainstream of popular culture, when simplified and stylized forms became popular, often associated with dreams of a space-age high-tech future

 doosraa, isane yah dikhaaya ki utkrushtwargeey aadhuniktaavaadi or vishaal upabhoktavaadi samskruti ke bich ke bhed ne apni parishuddhta ko kho diya tha
 Some writers declared that modernism had become so institutionalized that it was now "post-art-pioneering", indicating that it had lost its power as a revolutionary movement
 kaiyon ne is parivartan kii vyakhya us charan kii shuruyaat ke rup main kii he jise uttaradhuniktawaad ke naam se prachlit hua
 According to others such as art critic Robert Hughes, postmodernism represents an extension of modernism
 "aadhunik-virdohi" yaa "pratyaadhunik" aandolan aadhuniktawaad ke nivaaran yaa pratikaar ke rup main sakalyawaad, sangyojan evam aadhyatmikta par jor dena chaahate hai
 Such movements see modernism as reductionist and therefore subject to the inability to see systemic and contingent effects
 kai aadhuniktaavaadi is drushtikon ko apanaate hai, udhaaharan ke taur par paul hindmyth ne rahasyavaad kii taraf apane antim mode main aisa kiya tha
 Writers such as The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World, Paul H
 Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson, Frederick Turner in a Culture of Hope, and Lester Brown in Plan B, have themselves criticized the basic idea of modernism as individual creative Expression must conform to the realities of technology
 Instead, they argue, individual creativity should make everyday life more emotionally acceptable
 kuch kshetron main aadhuniktawaad ke prabhaav anya kii tulana main adhik shaktishaalee or adhik drudh bane hue hai
 Visual arts have severed ties to their past
 adhikansh pramukh rajdhani shaharon main uttar-punarjagran kala se alag, 'aadhunik kala' ko samarpit sangrahalay hai
 Examples include New York's Museum of Modern Art, London's Tate Modern and Paris's Center Pompidou
 ye gailaree aadhuniktaavaadi or uttaradhuniktaavaadi charnon ke darmyaan kisi tarah kaa koi bhed nahin karte hai, donon ko 'aadhunik kala' ke bheetar vikasaatmak ghatnakramon ke rup main dekhte hai
 Modernism is a broad label of a wide variety of cultural movements
 uttaradhuniktawaad anivaary rup se ek kendrikrut andolan he jisane saamaajik-ranjithik siddhant ke aadhaar par khud apana namakaran kiya, haalanki is shabd kaa istemaal apana vyapak arthon main 20veen sadi se aage kii gatividhiyon ko sandarbhit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he jo aadhunik kii jaagrukta kaa pradarshan karte hai or isaki punarvyakhya karte hai
 Postmodern theory emphasizes that the attempt to classify modernism with the title of "post facto" is beset by mismatched contradictions
 ek atisankeern arth main, jo kuch bhi aadhuniktaavaadi tha, vah aavashyakt rup se uttaradhunik bhi nahin tha
 The elements of modernism emphasizing the benefits of socio-technological progress and consciousness were only modernist

 His mother's name was Anandi Devi and father Munshi Ajayabarya was a postman in Lamhi

 He was influenced by the Arya Samaj, which was a major religious and social movement at that time

 1910 main unki rachana soje-vatan ke liye hamirpur ke jila colector ne talab kiya or un par janata ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai
 urdu main prakashit hone vaali zamana patrika ke sampadak or unke ajij dost munshi dayanarayan nigam ne unhen premchand naam se likhane kii salaah di
 After this, he started writing in the name of Premchand

 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala
 He presided over the conference of the All India Progressive Writers Association in 1936 in Lucknow

 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he
 Dr
 Kamalkishore Goenka has published the entire hindi-urdu story of Premchand under the name Premchand Kahani Rachnavali
 unke anusaar premchand ne kul 301 kahaniyaan likhi hai jinamein 3 abhi aprapya hai
 Premchand's first story collection titled Soze Vatan was published in June 1908
 isi sangrah kii pehali kahani duniya kaa sabase anmol ratan ko aam taur par unki pehali prakashit kahani mana jaataa rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Goenka, Worldly Love and desh-prem published in the April issue of Zamana, an Urdu monthly magazine originating from Kanpur, is actually his first published story
 unke jivan kaal main kul nau kahani sangrah prakashit hue- 'sapt saroj', 'navnidhi', 'prempurnima', 'prem-pachisi', 'prem-pratimaa', 'prem-dwadashi', 'samaryatra', 'maansarovar' : bhaag ek va do or 'kafan'
 After his death, his stories were published in 8 parts titled 'mansarovar'
 premchand sahitya ke mudradhikaar se mukt hote hi vibhinn sampadakon or prakashkon ne premchand kii kahaniyon ke sankalan taiyaar kar prakashit karaae
 His stories have diversity of subject and craft
 unhone manushya ke sabhi virgon se lekar pashu-pakshiyon tak ko apni kahaniyon main mukhya paatr banaaya he
 The problems of farmers, laborers, women, Dalits, etc
 have been depicted seriously in their stories
 unhone samajasudhar, deshprem, swadhinata sangram aadi se sambandhit kahaniyaan likhi hai
 His historical stories and love stories also proved to be quite popular
 premchand kii pramukh kahaniyon main ye naam liye ja sakate hai- 'panch parameshwar', 'gulli danda', 'do belon kii katha', 'idgah', 'bade bhai sahab', 'pus kii raat', 'kafan', 'thakur kaa kuan', 'sadgati', 'budhi kaaki', 'tawan', 'vidhwans', 'doodh kaa daam', 'mantra' aadi
 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya
 'premchand: Miscellaneous Context' edited by Amritrai is actually a compilation of Premchand's articles
 premchand ke lekh prakaashan santhaan se 'kuch vichaar' sheershak se bhi chape hai
 Premchand's famous writings include the following articles - Purpose of Literature, Old Age New Age, Benefits of Swaraj, Story Art, Some thoughts about the Qaumi language, Unity of hindi-urdu, Mahajani Civilization, Upanayas, Literature in life
 Location etc
 premchand ek safal anuvadak bhi the
 He also translated the works of writers of other languages whom he read and were influenced by
 'tollstoy kii kahaniyaan', galsvardi ke teen naatakon kaa 'hadtaal', 'chaandi kii dibiya' or 'nyaay' naam se anuwaad kiya
 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane
 Gave Hindi its special idiom and openness
 kahani or upanyaas dono main ugantarkari parivartan kiye
 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty
 ye bhi galat nahin he ki ve aam bhartiya ke rachanaakaar the
 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
