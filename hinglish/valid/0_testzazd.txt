 T
 was equivalent to an explosion of 22,000 tons
 ab to pratham parmaanu bam se bahut adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam bane hai
 The detonating substance in a nuclear bomb is uranium or plutonium
 uranium yaa plutonium ke parmaanu vikhandan se hi shakti praapt hoti he
 For this, neutrons are struck in the nucleus of the atom
 is prahaar se hi bahut badi maatra main urja praapt hoti he
 This process is called physicist nuclear fission
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke abhyantar main jo neutron hote hai unheen se neutron mukt hote hai
 These neutrons strike other atoms and cause fragmentation again
 ye phir anya parmaanuon kaa vikhandan karte hai
 This is how chain actions begin
 parmaanu bam kii aniyantrit shrunkhlaa kriyaaon ke falswaroop bheeshan prachandta ke saath parmaanu kaa visphot hota he
 Many isotopes of uranium are known
 saamaanya uranium main 99
3 pratishat you-238 or 0
7 pratishat you-235 rahete hai
 The fragmentation of U-238 is not as easy as the fragmentation of U-235
 you-235 main you-238 kii apeksha teen neutron kam rahete hai
 It is due to this lack of neutrons that fragmentation of U-235 occurs easily
 anya vikhandaneey padaarth jo parmaanu bam main kaam aate hai ve you-233 or plutonium-239 hai
 a nuclear explosion requires critical codes of fissile material
 shrunkhlaa kriya ke chaalu karne ke liye kranthik sanhati nunatam maatra he
 If the amount of fissile material is less than the critical code, then the neutron will only continue to crumble
 maatra ke dhire dhire badhaane se ek samay aisi avasthaa aegi jab kam se kam ek unmukt neutron ek nae parmaanu par prahaar kar uskaa vikhandan kar degaa
 On reaching such a state, the fragmentation process starts running automatically
 kranthik sanhati kii maatra gopneey he
 Only those nations that make nuclear bombs know and do not tell others
 yadi you-235 kii kranthik sanhati 20 pound he to das das pound do jagah lene se shrunkhlaa kriya chaalu nahin hogi
 Taking 20 pounds together will start the chain operation
 shrunkhlaakriya main neutron kii sankhya badi shighrata se badhati he
 Fission in a nuclear bomb raises the heat of uranium and other substances adjacent to it very quickly
 dhatvik uranium badi unchi daab or taap par tapadipt gas main parinat ho jaataa he
 The temperature of the explosive body is 10,00,00,000 ° C
 Wakes up to itane unche taap par uranium kii thapi hat jaati he
 Then the whole body explodes with great intensity

 Hydrogen bombs are a variety of nuclear bombs
 hydrogen bam yaa ech-bam adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam hota he
 It requires isotopic du terium and tritium of hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke sanlayan karne se bam kaa visphot hota he
 For this fusion, the temperature is very high, about 500,00,000 ° C
 Is required
 yah taap surya ke ooshnatam bhaag ke taap se bahut unchaa he
 Atomic bombs can achieve such high temperature
 america, england, rus, china va bharat ne hydrogen bam kaa pareekshan kiya
 North Korea is also believed to have made such a dangerous bomb
 jab parmaanu bam aavashyak taap utpann karata he tabhi hydrogen parmaanu sanlayit hote hai
 This fusion produces heat and powerful rays that turn hydrogen into helium
 1922 i
 main pehle pahal pataa laga tha ki hydrogen parmaanu ke visphot se bahut adhik urja utpann ho sakati he
 Heavy hydrogen called deuterium was invented in 1932 and heavy hydrogen called triterium in 1934
 1950 i

 It describes cosmology, the lineages of deities, kings, heroes, sages, sages, folklore, pilgrimage, temples, medicine, astronomy, grammar, mineralogy, humor, love stories, as well as theology and philosophy
 vibhinn puraanon kii vishay-vastu main bahut adhik asamanta he
 Not only this, many manuscripts of the same Purana have been received which are different from each other
 hindu puraanon ke rachanaakaar agyaat hai or aisa lagata he ki kai rachanakaaron ne kai shatabdiyon main inaki rachana kii he
 In contrast, the Jain Puranas can be described as the creation of the Jain Puranas and the names of the creators
 karmkand se gyaan kii ore aate hue bhartiya maanas main puraanon ke madhyam se bhakthi kii aviral dhara pravaahit hui he
 In the same process of development, Manas gradually moved towards Avatarism or Saguna Bhakti by the formative interpretation of polytheism and Nirguna Brahma
 puraanon main vaidic kaal se chale aate hue sristi aadi sambandhi vichaaron, pracheen raajaaon or rishiyon ke paramparaagat vrittanton tathaa kahaniyon aadi ke sangrah ke saath saath kalpit kathaon kii vichitrataa or rochak varnanon dwaara sampradayik yaa saadhaaran upadesh bhi milte hai
 The Puranas are not proof texts like Shruti, Smriti etc
 puraanon main vishnu, vaayu, matsay or bhagwat main aitihaasik vrutt— raajaaon kii vanshavali aadi ke rup main bahut kuch milte hai
 Although these genealogies are very brief and there are some contradictions among them, but they are of great use
 puraanon kii ore aitihaasikon ne idhar vishesh rup se dhyaan diya he or ve in vanshawaliyon kii chaanbin main lage hai
 'purana' literally means 'ancient legend' or 'old story'
 ‘pura’ shabd kaa arth he - anaagat evam ateet
 The word 'ana' means - say or tell
 raghuvansh main puraana shabd kaa arth he "puraana patrapag magannataram" evam vaidic vaanmay main "pracheen: vrittant:" diya gaya he
 From the cultural meaning, those specific scriptures of Hindu culture, which have been described in words from the creation to the Holocaust, are called Puranas
 puraana shabd kaa ullekh vaidic yug ke veda sahit aditam sahitya main bhi paaya jaataa he at: ye sabase puraatan maane ja sakate hai
 According to the Atharvaveda "ritch: Samani Chhandansi Purana Yajusha Sah 11
7
2") meaning the Puranas originated with Rik, Sama, Yajusud o Chand
 shatapath brahman main to puranavagamay ko veda hi kaha gaya he
 The Chandogya Upanishad has also called Purana the Veda
 brihadaaranyakopanishad tathaa mahabharat main kaha gaya he ki "itihaas puranabhyaan vedarth mupbarhayet" arthath veda kaa arthvistaar puraana ke dwaara karnaa chaiye
 It is clear from them that Puran and history have been kept on the same level in the Vedic period
 amarkosh aadi pracheen koshon main puraana ke paanch lakshan maane gayi hai : sarg, pratisarg, vansh, manvantar, or vanshanucharit 
 It is believed that Brahma, the creator of the universe, who first composed the oldest scripture, is known as Purana
 prachinkaal se puraana devataaon, rishiyon, manushyon - sabhi kaa maargdarshan karte rahe hai
 The Puranas teach man to lead a life according to religion and policy
 puraana manushya ke karmon kaa vishleshan kar unhen dushkarm karne se rokte hai
 The Puranas are virtually an extension of the Vedas
 veda bahut hi jatil tathaa shushk bhashaa-style main likhe gaye hai
 Ved Vyas ji composed and reconstructed the Puranas
 kaha jaataa he, ‘‘purna puraana ’’ jiskaa arth he, jo vedon kaa poorak ho, arthath puraana 
 The sayings in the complex language of the Vedas are explained in simple language in the Puranas
 puraana-sahitya main avatharavaad ko pratishthit kiya gaya he
 Believing the power of the formless formless, worshiping the virtuous form is the subject of these texts
 puraanon main alag-alag devi-devataaon ko kendra main rakhkar paap-punya, dharm-adharm or karm-akarm kii kahaniyaan hai
 Love, devotion, sacrifice, service, tolerance are human qualities in the absence of which an advanced society cannot be imagined
 puraanon main devi-devataaon ke anek swaroopon ko lekar ek vistrut vivaran miltaa he
 Puranas have detailed depiction of misdeeds in revealing truth
 puranakaron ne devataaon kii dushpravritiyon kaa vyapak vivaran kiya he lekin mul uddeshy sadbhaavna kaa vikaas or satya kii pratishtha hi he
 Vanshabali of kings is found only in 5 Matsya, Vayu, Vishnu, Brahmin and Bhagavata Puranas
 puraana atharah hai
 M-2, B-2, Br-3, V-4
 a-1,naa-1, pa-1, lin-1, ga-1, ku-1, sk-1 
vishnu puraana ke anusaar unke naam ye hai—vishnu, padam, brahm, vaayu, bhagwat, naarad, markendeya, agni, brahmavaivart, ling, varah, skanda, vaaman, kurm, matsay, garuda, brahmad or bhavishya
 a peculiarity in the Puranas is that each Purana has names and their number of Atharho Puranas
 naam or shlokasankhya praayah sabaki milti he, kahin kahin bhed he
 Such as Vayu Purana in place of Agni in the Koram Purana; Narsinghpurana in place of Lingapurana in Markandeya Purana; There is Narada Purana in place of Shiva Purana in Devi Bhagwat and Vayu Purana in Matsya
 bhagwat ke naam se aajkal do puraana milte hai—ek shrimadbhagwat, doosraa devibhagwat
 Who is really Purana, there is a fight over it
 ramashram swami ne 'durjanmukhachapetica' main siddh kiya he ki shrimadbhagwat hi puraana he
 On this, Kashinath Bhatt wrote 'durjanmukhahachapetika' and another Pandit wrote 'durjanmukhapadyapaduka' in favor of Devi Bhagwat
 sukhsagar ke anusaara The oldest of the Puranas appears to be Vishnupurana
 usamen sampradayik khinchataan or ragadwesh nahin he
 The five characteristics of the Purana also fall on it
 usamen sristi kii utpatti or lay, manwantaron, bhartadi khandon or suryaadi lokon, vedon kii shakhaon tathaa vedavyas dwaara unke vibhaag, surya vansh, chandra vansh aadi kaa varnan he
 Among the kings of Kali, even the Maurya kings of Magadha and the kings of the Gupta dynasty are mentioned
 shrikrishna kii lilaon kaa bhi varnan he par bilkul us rup main nahin jis rup main bhagwat main he
 Some people say that Vayu Purana is the Shiv Purana because the present day Purana or Upapurana called Shiv Purana has no verse number of 24,000, only 7,000
 vayupurana ke chaar paad he jinamein sristi kii utpatti, kalpon ore manwantaron, vaidic rishiyon kii gaathaon, daksh prajapati kii kanyaon se bhinn bhinn jeevotpati, suryavanshi or chandravanshi raajaaon kii vanshavali tathaa kali ke raajaaon kaa praayah vishnupurana ke anusaar varnan he
 In addition to manvantars and dynasties in the Matsyapuran, Varnashrama Dharma is described in great detail and the whole story of Matsyavatar
 isamen may aadi asuron ke sanhaar, maatrulok, pitrulok, murti or mandir banane kii vidhi kaa varnan vishesh dhang kaa he
 The preaching of Shrimad Bhagwat is the most because it contains a detailed description of the greatness of devotion and the pastimes of Shri Krishna
 nau skandhon ke bheetar to jeevabrahm kii ekta, bhakthi kaa mahatv, sristilila, kapildev kaa janm or apni mata ke prati vaishnav bhavanusaar sankhyashastra kaa upadesh, manwantar or rishivanshavali, avatar jisamen rishabhdev kaa bhi prasang he, dhruv, venu, pruthu, prahlaad ityadi kii katha, samudramathan aadi anek vishay hai
 But the biggest tenth is the wing in which Krishna's Leela is described in detail
 isi skandh ke aadhaar par shringaar or bhakthiras se purna krishnacharit sambandhi sanskrit or bhashaa ke anek granth bane hai
 The Ekadash wing describes the destruction of the Yadavas and the twelfth kingship of the Rāchas of Kali Yuga
 bhagwat kii lekhanstyli anya puraanon se bhinn he
 Its language is erudite and full of literary wonders, due to which its creation is considered to be somewhat behind
 agnipurana ek vilakshan puraana he jisamen rajvanshawaliyon tathaa sankshipt kathaon ke atirikt dharamshastra, raajnneeti, rajdharm, prajadharm, ayurveda, vyakaran, ras, alankaar, shastr-vidya aadi anek vishay hai
 There is also a detailed case of Tantradiksha
 kali ke raajaaon kii vanshavali vikram tak ai he, avatar prasang bhi he
 There are similar stories in other Puranas
 vishnupurana ke atirikt or puraana jo aajkal milte hai unke vishay main andeh hota he ki ve asal puraanon ke na milane par peeche se na banaae gaye hon
 Many of the Puranas are filled with differences of opinion and cults
 koi kisi devtaa kii pradhanta sthapit karata he, koi kisi devtaa kii pradhanta sthapit karata he, koi kisi kii
 According to the introduction of Brahmavaivarta Purana, which is given in Matsyapurana, it should contain the story of Rathantar Kalpa and Varaha Avatar, but the Brahmavaivarta which is found today is not in this story
 krishna ke vrundavan ke raas se jin bhakton kii tripti nahin hui thi unke liye golok main sadaa honevaale raas kaa usamen varnan he
 This Brahmavaivart of today is several hundred years behind the arrival of the Muslims because it also mentions the origin of the 'julaha' caste - Mlechhat Kuvindakanya Jola Jatirbhabhav
 brahmpurana main tirthon or unke mahatmaya kaa varnan bahut adhik hai, anant vasudev or purushottam mahatmaya tathaa or bahut se aise tirthon ke mahatmaya likhe gaye hai jo pracheen nahin kahe ja sakate
 'purushottam Prasad' is definitely a reference to the huge temple of Jagannath ji, which was built by King Chodaganga of the Ganga dynasty
 matsaypurana main die hue lakshan aajkal ke padmapurana main bhi puure nahin milte hai
 There are many things in this about the hostility of Vaishnava communalists
 jaise, pashadilakshan, mayavadaninda, taamsashastra, puranavarnanaityadi
 Vaiseshika, Nyaya, Samkhya and Charvak have been called 'tamas Shastra' and it has also been told that the Buddha-form Vishnu called Asat Buddhist scripture for the destruction of the demons
 isi prakaar matsay, kurm, ling, shiv, skanda or agni taamas puraana kahe gaye hai
 The essence is that the present form of most Puranas is within a thousand years
 sabake sab puraana sampradayik he, isamen bhi koi andeh nahin he
 Many Puranas meet a lot in their ancient form, but in them also communalists have increased many things
 yadhyapi aajkal jo puraana milte hai unamem se adhiktar peeche se bane hue yaa prakshipt vishyon se bhare hue hai tathaapi puraana bahut pracheen kaal se prachlit the
 It is written in the Brihadaranyaka and Shatapatha Brahmana that smoke emanates from the wet wood in the same way as the expulsion of the great ghosts led to the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvangiras, history, mythology, Upanishads, shlokas, sutras, lectures and lectures
 chhandogya upanishad main bhi likhaa he ki itihaas puraana vedon main paanchavaan veda he
 Puranas were also prevalent with the Vedas in the very ancient times, which were said on the occasion of Yajna etc
 kai baaten jo puraana ke lakshanon main hai, vedon main bhi hai
 Like, before there was nothing else, it was canto or creation; Devasur Sangram, Urvashi Pururava dialogue is history
 mahabharat ke aadi parv main bhi anek raajaaon ke naam or kuch vishay ginaakar kaha gaya he ki inke vrittant vidwaan satkaviyon dwaara puraana main kahe gaye hai
 It can be said that there were Puranas even during the creation of Mahabharata
 manusmriti main bhi likhaa he ki pitrikaaryon main veda, dharamshastra, itihaas, puraana aadi sunaane chahie
 Now the question is, who made the Puranas
 shivpurana ke antargat reva mahatmaya main likhaa he ki atharahon puraanon ke vaktaa matyavatisut vyas hai
 The same thing is prevalent in common people
 par matsaypurana main spasht likhaa he ki pehle puraana ek hi tha, usee se 18 puraana hue 
 It is written in the Brahmanda Purana that Ved Vyasa compiled a Puranasamhita
 iske aage kii baat kaa pataa vishnu puraana se lagata he
 It says that Vyasa had a disciple named 'lomhadisha' who belonged to the Suti caste
 vyas ji ne apni puraana samhita usee ke haath main di
 Lomhadris had six disciples - Sumati, Agnivarcha, Mitrayu, Shanshapayan, Akitavran and Savarni
 inamen se akrutvran, saavarni or shanshpayan ne lomaharshan se padhi hui puranasamhita ke aadhaar par or ek ek samhita banaai
 Just as Ved Vyasa collected mantras and divided them into codes, similarly Puranasamhita was compiled by collecting circles coming in the name of Purana
 usee ek samhita ko lekar sut ke chelon ke teen or sanhitaayen banaai
 Eighteen Puranas would have been made on the basis of these codes
 matsay, vishnu, brahmad aadi sab puraanon main brahmpurana pehla kaha gaya he, par jo brahmpurana aajkal prachlit he vah kaisaa he yah pehle kaha ja chukaa he
 Whatever it is, it is proved from the above proof that eighteen Puranas are not made of Ved Vyasa
 jo puraana aajkal milte hai unamem vishnupurana or brahmadpurana kii rachana auron se pracheen jaan padati he
 The 'future dynasty' in the Vishnupurana mentions even the kings of the Gupta dynasty, this episode cannot be earlier than the sixth century of Christ
 java ke aage jo bali dweep he vahaan ke hinduon ke paas brahmandpurana mila he
 The ancestors of these Hindus settled in the islands of the East in India in the fifth century of Christ
 baliwaale brahmadpurana main 'bhavishya rajvansh prakaran' nahin he, usamen janamejay ke praputra adhisimakrishna tak kaa naam paaya jaataa he
 This is to be noted
 isse prakat hota he ki puraanon main jo bhavishya rajvansh he vah peeche se joda hua he
 The ancient copies of Brahmanda Purana are found here, to see how far the past and present-day action is used in them
 'bhavishyarajvansh varnan' ke purv unamem ye shloke milte hai— It is revealed from the above passage that the Adi Brahmapurana was made in the time of Adhishikrishna
 isi prakaar vishnupurana, matsaypurana aadi kii pariksha karne se pataa chalata he ki aadi vishnupurana parakshit ke samay main or aadi matsaypurana janamejay ke praputra adhisimakrishna ke samay main sankalit hua
 Eighteen Puranas from Purana Samhita were formed in very ancient times, it is known
 aapstamb dharmasutra main bhavishyapurana kaa pramaan is prakaar udadhrut he— It is a must that Puranas are not found in their primitive form nowadays
 bahut se puraana to asal puraanon ke na milane par phir se nae rache gaye hai, kuch main bahut si baaten jod di gai hai
 Almost all the Puranas are nutritious to one of the Shaiva, Vaishnava sect and solar sects, there is no doubt about it
 vishnu, rudra, surya aadi kii upasna vaidic kaal se hi chali aati thi, phir dhire dhire kuch log kisi ek devtaa ko pradhanta dene lage, kuch log duusare ko
 Thus the cults started behind the Mahabharata
 puranasamhitaayein usee samay main baniin
 Then later became Adipuranas, some of whose parts are within some Puranas found today
 puraanon kaa uddeshy puraane vritton kaa sangrah karnaa, kuch pracheen or kuch kalpit kathaon dwaara upadesh dena, devamahima tathaa tirthamahima ke varnan dwaara jansadharan main dharmbuddhi sthir rakhana tha
 From this, Vyas gave a man of sutra caste to propagate his collected Adipuran Samhita
 jain parampara main 63 shalakapurush maane gaye hai
 The Puranas have their stories and descriptions of religion etc
 praakrit, sanskrit, apbhransh tathaa anya deshi bhashaaon main anek puraanon kii rachana hui he
 The Puranas and literature of both the sects are available in large quantities
 inamen bhartiya itihaas kii mahatvapurn saamagree milti he
 In Jainism, 24 Puranas are named after Tirthakaras; There are many more, including the supernatural character of the Tirthankaras, their superiority to all the gods, detailed description of Jainism related elements, fruitfulness, greatness etc
 alag padmapurana or harivansh bhi hai
 The main Puranas are: 'adipuran' of Jinsen and 'arishtanemi' Purana of Jinsen, 'padmapurana' of Ravishana and 'uttapurana' of Gunabhadra
 praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main bhi ye puraana uplabdh hai
 These Puranas are very important in terms of India's culture, tradition, philosophical thought, language, style etc
 samast aagam grantho ko chaar bhaago main baanta gaya he First aid karnanuyog Charananuga dravyanuyog

 In the final stages of development, Shakespeare created Perrickles, Sinvelin, 'the Winters Tale', 'the Tempest' Prabhriti plays, which, despite being peaceful, filled with sad possibilities and created an evening atmosphere
 in sukhaant du:khant naatakon ko romance athwa shakespeare ke antim naatakon kii sangya di jaati he
 Shakespeare's pleasant plays have their own personal characteristics
 yadhyapi 'di kamedi aav erars' main platus kaa anusaran kiya gaya he tathaapi anya sukhaant naatak pracheen clasiki naatakon se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Their purpose is not to eradicate the deformities and improve the errors by the skit, but to entertain people through interesting story and characterization

 Huh

 Both are embedded in grief in life, so both are transient

 Only in his last play 'the Tempest' have he managed the three inventions
 praaia: sabhi anya naatakon main keval karyanviti kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he, samay or sthaan kii drushti se ve nitant niabandh hai
 There is always enough detail in the plot and usually many stories are embedded in it
 udaahranarth ham e mid samar nits dream, di marchent aav venice, aiz you like it athwa king lier ko le sakate hai
 In all these, a mix of many stories has done the objective work
 kintu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki shakespeare ke naatakon kii banaavat trutipurna he
 The end-of-the-story storytelling is beautifully crafted, and there is a sense of unity collected from the entire plot
 shastreey arth main anvitiyon kaa abhaav hone par bhi in svachhndathawadi naatakon main bhavanatmak tathaa kalpanaatmak ekikaran hua he
 Shakespeare has more success in characterization
 apane naatakon main unhone anek aakarshak paatro kii sristi kii he jo apane jeevant rup main hamaare saamne aate hai
 Over time the process of characterization became more and more subtle and artistic
 udhaaharan ke liye ham sukhaant naatakon main samavisht rojalin, porcia, viartras, rojalind, vyla prabhruti pragalbha naariyon ko le sakate hai jo apni prakhar buddhi or vaakchaturi kaa parichay nirantar detii hai
 The second category are those women whose unique beauty and perilous experiences lead to compassion in the mind
 es naariyon main pramukh hai juliet, ophilia, desdymona, cardilia, imozen ityadi
 Characterization is highly important in sad plays
 udhaaharan ke liye ham hamelet ko le sakate hai
 All the events of the play are centered on the character of the protagonist and the narrative evolves from the attitude of his personality 
 anshat: yahi baat anya du:khant naatakon ke liye bhi satya he
 Many memorable characters are found in ancient Greek plays, but Shakespeare's main characters, depicted using moral and psychological devices, are far more interesting and attractive
 aantarik dwandv ke upyog se du:khant naatakon kii patrakalpana or bhi adhik chamatkaarpurn ho gai he
 Some other characters in Shakespeare's plays are also notable such as clown and villain
 vidushakon main phalstaff tochastone, feste or king lier kaa swamibhakt vidooshak aadi mahatvapurn hai
 Villains include Richard III, Iago, Edmund Iyashi, etc
 jaisaa hazlit ne likhaa he, shakespeare kii shakti kaa pataa isse lagata he ki na keval unke mahatvapurn paatro main vaishishty he varan unke bahusankhyak laghu paatr bhi apana nijee mahatv rakhte hai
 Although prose is used elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays, they are still poetic in origin
 unka adhikansh bhaag chandobaddh he
 Not only this, almost all theatrical works are full of poetic qualities
 kalpana kaa prakaashan, alankarik abhivyakti, sangitatmak lay tathaa komal bhaawanaaon ke nirupan dwaara shakespeare ne manomuguakari prabhaav utpann kar diya he
 Since ancient times, plays were considered a mere distinction of poetry and Shakespeare accepted the ancient notion
 gadhy kaa prayog yada kada vishesh prayojan se hua he
 But in general we can call Shakespeare's plays poetic
 kavyatatv shuru main atyadhik tha kintu shanai: shanai: uskaa rup sanyat ho gaya or prayojan ke vichaar se uskaa niyantran hone laga
 Likewise, there was a constant effort to incorporate Shakespeare's style; As a result, early plays have an abundance of elaborate narratives and beautiful metaphors
 His style was balanced in his mature age by the time Shakespeare was composing his famous sorrowful plays
 praathmik avasthaa main abhivyakti kaa adhik mahatv tha or vichaaron kaa kam
 But in this secondary period, there is proper coordination of ideas, expressions and means of expression
 yah santulit vyavastha antim varshon main shakespeare kaa dhyaan vichaaron or naitik pratimaanon par kendrit tha or unhone shailigat chamatkaar kii upeksha kii
 That is why the style of the final plays has gone somewhere rough
 shakespeare ne apane naatak mukhyat: rangamanch par abhinay ke liye likhe the, yadhyapi kaavyatmak gunon ke kaaran ham unase pathan dwaara bhi anand praapt karte hai
 The arrangement of the acting of the erstwhile theater, the public interest of the audience, all influenced Shakespeare's theatrical production
 do ek udhaaharan hi paryaapt honge
 At that time dyed curtains were not used, so many descriptive pieces have been included in plays
 inhen varnanon dwaara sthaan, kaal or paristhiti kaa sanket hota tha
 The continuous use of the subject and self-talk in plays was possible because the next triangular part of the theater continued to spread among the observers
 kai purush or nari paatro kaa sarjan shakespeare ne keval isliye kiya ki unke upyukt abhinayta uplabdh the
 Many scenes have been opened for the entertainment of the audience, in which exciting and entertaining situations have been performed at the theater
 aaj ke yathartwaadee rangamanch kii bhanti elizveth yugin rangamanch prachur sadhano tathaa nishchit vyavastha dwaara bandhaa hua tha
 Both the acting and the performances were relatively free, so Shakespeare's plays have enough merit
 praaia: sabhi prakaar ke naatakon main mahakavi ne gey muktakon kaa sannivesh kiya he jo apane saundarya or maadhurya ke liye anupam hai
 Apart from these, there are elaborate poems of Shakespeare, in which 'vince and Adonis', 'the Rape of Lucreis' and Sanates are required to be mentioned
 ye sabhi kritiyaan 16 veen shatabdi ke antim dashak kii hai jab shakespeare kaa man saundarya evam pranay ke prabhaav se ahladaparn ho gaya tha
 An ancient love story has been described in a very poetic manner in 'vince and Adonis'
 'di rape ov lukris' main ek param sundari roman mahila ke durbhaagya or mrityu kii katha he
 There are some in the Sannets who are related to a friend of the poet who had decided not to marry
 shakespeare ne uske rup or gunon kii charchaa karte hue usase apana nishchay badalane ke liye aagrah kiya he
 The second order of the sennets is related to a Shyamvarna woman, who had developed intense attraction in the mind of the poet, but who did not respect the affection and gave her love to the friend of the poet, keeping in mind the first order of the sennets
 shakespeare ne in saneton main apni aantarik bhaawanaaon kaa prakaashan kiya he athwa ve paramparaagat rachanaayen maatr hai, yah prashn atyant vivadagrast he
 The "business plan" under the title is called the plot
 "kathanak" or "katha" donon hi shabd sanskrit "cath" dhaatu se utpann hai
 In Sanskrit literature, the word "katha" has been used in the sense of a certain poetic form, but the common meaning of the word Katha is "that which is said"
 yahan kahanevaale ke saath-saath sunanevaale kii upasthiti bhi antarbhukt he kayonki "kahana' shabd tabhi sarthak hota he jab use sunanevaala bhi koi ho
 In the absence of a listener one can only imagine "speaking" or "murmuring", not "saying"
 iske saath hi, vah sabhi kuch "jo kaha jaae' katha kii parisimaaon main nahin simat paata
 Hence, narrative refers to the saying or narration of an "alleged event" that has a definite sequence and outcome
 i
em
 farster ne "ghatnaon ke kalanukramik varnan' ko katha kii sangya di he; jaise, naashte ke baad madhyahn kaa bhojan, somvaar ke baad mangalvaar, yauvan ke baad vriddhavastha aadi
 Conversely, there is an element of the storyline that accompanies them by becoming the axis of the chronologically chained events described in it, and all the events of the narrative around which the weft grows and develops
 katha yaa kahani bhi saadhaarant: kaaryavyapaar kii yojana hi hoti he, parantu kisi ek bhi katha ko kathanak nahin kaha ja saktaa; kaaran, katha kii vishistataa keval uske kalanukramik varnan ko abhibhoot kar leti he
 "the protagonist fell in love with the heroine and eventually she was chosen
 '-katha he
 "the hero saw the heroine, he became enamored with her
 praptimarg ke anek avarodhon ko apane shaury or lagan se dur karke, ant main, usne nayika se vivaah kar liya
 '- is the plot
 arthath katha kisi bhi kathatmak saahitiyik kriti kaa dhaanchaa maatr hoti he jabaki kathanak main tatprastut prakaranwastu ke anuroop katha kaa swaroop spasht, sangat evam buddhigrahya banakar ubharta he
 According to Webster, the definition of plot is as follows- uparyukt vivechan se is mahatvapurn tathy kaa udghaatan hota he ki katha ko sunate yaa padhate samay shrota athwa pathak ke man main aage aanevaali ghatnaon ko jaanane kii jigyaasa rahati he arthath vah baar-baar yahi poochta yaa sochataa he ki phir kya hua, jabaki kathanak main vah ye prashn bhi uthaata he ki "aisa kyon hua?' "yah kaise hua?' aadi
 That is, along with the curiosity to know the events that occur next, the listener or reader is also conscious of the work-cause-relationship between the events
 katha guhamanav kii jigyaasa ko shant kar sakati he kintu buddhipravan vyakti kii tripti kathanak ke madhyam se hi sambhav he
 Therefore, it can be said that the movement of time in the plot opens the event and at the same time its occurrence is based on the rational work-cause-interrelationship, in accordance with the rational composition of the world
 isiilie usamen aarambh, madhya or ant, teenon hi sunishchit rahata he
 These three steps can be clearly seen in the beginning story of "adam Eve"; as, prohibition, violation and punishment
 kathanak kala kaa saadhan he, at: bhavottejnaa laane ke liye usamen jivan kii pratyayjanak yarthatata ke saath aakasmikta kaa tatv bhi aavashyak he
 That is why the events of the plot are not aligned to the exact events of the real events, but are aligned according to the self-created legislation
 kathanak dev daanav, atipraakrit or aprakrit ghatnaon se bhi nirmit hote hai kintu unka ukt nirmaan parampara dwaara sweekrut vidhaan tathaa abhipraayon ke anusaar hi hota he
 Therefore, despite being unreliable they are reliable
 kathanak kii gatisheel ghatnaayen sidhi rekha main nahin chalatin
 They have ups and downs, fate changes, circumstances make a man from something 1 He often has to contend with his companions or against external powers, ie his situation
 kathanak main jivan ke isi gatiman sangharkshil rup kii jeevant avatarana kii jaati he
 Siddhasena Diwakar was a famous Jain Acharya of the fifth century

 It is said that he composed many texts but most of them are not available at the present time
 'sanmatitark' unki tarkshastra kii sarvshereshth rachana he or vartmaan samay main bhi bahut padhi jaati he
 He also wrote a book titled 'kalyanamindistrastotram'

 Planck replied that i want to learn old things only
 After Plank's move to this field, there were so many new discoveries in physics that might not have happened in the last thousand years

 usee samay kuch electric companiyon ne uske saamne ek aise prakaash strot ko banane kii samasya rakhi jo nunatam urja kii khapat main adhik se adhik prakaash paidaa kar sake
 This problem turned Planck's approach to the study of radiation
 He found out the electromagnetic nature of radiation
 is tarah gyaat hua ki prakaash, radio tarangen, parabangnee, infrared sabhi vikiran ke hi rup hai jo darasal vidyut chumbakeey tarangen hai
 Planck, working on black body radiation, gave a rule known as the wein-planck rule
 baad main usne paaya ki bahut se prayogon ke parinaam isse alag aate hai
 He reanalyzed his rule and arrived at a surprising new discovery, called Planck's quantum hypothesis
 in packets ko qvanta kaha jaataa he
 The energy of each quanta is fixed and depends only on the frequency of light
 plank kii is pariklpana ne bhautik jagat main halchal machaa di
 It was here that quantum physics, the new branch of physics, was born
 Later using the same hypothesis, Einstein explained the light-electric effect, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize

 swasth vayask manushya ke agnyashay main kuch 10 lakh ilet hote hai jo ki puure ang main faile hue hote hai; inaki kul maatra 1 se 1

 The hormones produced by the islets of Langerhans are secreted directly into the bloodstream by five types of cells

 Islets can affect each other via paracrine and autocrine communication, and beta cells are also electrically connected to other beta cells
 lengrhans ke ilet kii paracrine pratipushti pranali kaa yah dhaanchaa he: The electrical activity of pancreatic cells has been studied by patch clamp techniques and it has been found that the behavior of cells in monolithic islets is quite different from the behavior of dispersed cells

 Recent diagnostic experiments have shown that patients with unstable type 1 diabetes have achieved insulin independence and improved metabolic control multiple times through transplantation of islets from deceased donors

 Another source of beta cells, such as islets derived from adult stem cells or progenitor cells of a diabetic, may reduce the tightness of donors' organs for transplantation
 punarjanan chikitsa kaa kshetra kaafii tezi se viksit ho rahaa he or nikat bhavishya main kaafii aashaaen de saktaa he
 However, type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas
 atah ek prabhavi upachaar ke liye krambaddh, samikrut vidhi apnaani hogi jo ki upyukt va surakshit swapratirodhi avrodh or beta koshika punarjanan donon kaa hi khyal rakhe
 Islet cell transplantation is likely to bring back beta cells and treat diabetes, which is another option rather than complete pancreas transplantation or artificial pancreas
 ilinoy vishvavidhyalay ke chicago chikitsa centre main mukhyalayit chicago pariyojna yah koshish kar rahi he ki beta koshikaaon ko "in vivo" hi punarjanit kiya jaae
 It is worth noting that apoptosis occurs early in beta cells and is destroyed in the normally functioning pancreas
 iskaa strot pander, prathit hota he, yah ek jin he jo arene ke saath jud ke kaam karata he
 When activated, the pander blocks beta cells in s phase leading to apoptosis
