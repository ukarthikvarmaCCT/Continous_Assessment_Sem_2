 a significant and far-reaching change in human livelihoods and lifestyles was to cultivate the areas where crop cultivation was first introduced: essentially the nomadic hunter-gatherer pre-dependence on livelihood technology or pastoral infancy was first met and its Later, it was replaced by dependence on food produced from farms
 It is also believed that these developments had a significant impact on the development of settlements, as it may be believed that the increasing need to spend more time and effort to prepare the accounts required more localized housing

 The new game was definitely launched in 1873 at the Badminton House, owned by the Duke of Beaufort, Gloucestershire
 us samay tak, ise "badminton kaa khel" naam se janaa jaataa tha or baad main is khel kaa aadhikarik naam badminton ban gaya
 Until 1887, the game continued to be played in England under the rules issued in British India

 The following information is a simplified summary of the rule, not a complete copy
 beadbluef sanvidhi prakaashan niyam kaa nishchit strot he, haalanki niyam ke ankiy vitaran ke rekhachitr kii karaab pratikrutiyaan hai
 The court is rectangular and divided into two parts by a net
 aam taur par court ekal or yugal donon khel ke liye chihnit kiye jate hai, haalanki niyam sirf ekal ke liye court ko chihnit karne kii anumati detaa he
 Couple courts are wider than single courts, but both have the same length
 apwaad, jo aksar nae khilaadiyon ko bhram main daal detaa he ki yugal court kii sarv-lambaai aayam chota hota he
 The entire width of the court is 6
1 meters and the width of a single is 5
18 meters
 court kii puri lambaai 13
4 meter hoti he
 Service courts are marked by dividing the width of the court by a middle line
 net se 1
98 meter kii duuri par short sarvice rekha dwaara or bahari ore tathaa pichhali simaaon dwaara yah chihnit hota he
 In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0
78 meters from the rear boundary
 net kinaaron par 1
55 meter or bich main 1
524 meter ooncha hota he
 Poles in the net stand on the doubles, even when the singles are played
 badminton ke niyamon main court ke upar kii chat kii nunatam oonchai kaa koi ullekh nahin he
 Nevertheless, such a badminton court would not be considered good if the elevated serve touches the roof
 niyam nirdisht karata he ki koun-sa upkaran istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In particular, the rules regarding the design and shape of rackets and shuttlecocks are limited
 sahi gati ke liye shatalkock ke pareekshan kaa bhi niyam main praavdhaan hai: 3
1: Use a full underhand stroke to check the shuttlecock that takes the shuttlecock to the rear boundary line
 shatalkock ko ek upree kone par or samanaantar disha main said line kii ore maarna chahie
 3
2: a shuttlecock of the correct speed shall not fall at least 530 mm and more than 990 mm away from the other rear boundary line
 har khel 21 point par khelaa jaataa he, jahaan khilaadi ek raily jeet kar ek point score karata he 
 The best is a match in three games
 raily ke aarambh main, sarwar or resiver apane-apane sarvice court main ek-duusare ke tirchhe khadey hote hai 
 The server hits the shuttlecock in such a way that it falls into the receiver's service court
 This is similar to tennis, except that the badminton serve must be hit from below waist height and the racket shaft must be downward, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, and in badminton players have to stand inside their serve courts , Whereas this does not happen in tennis
 jab serving paksh ek raily haar jaataa he, tab sarv pratidwandvi yaa pratidwandviyon ko mil jaaya karata he 
 In singles, the server scores even if it stands in his right service court and his left service court when his score is odd
 yugal main, agar serving paksh ek raily jeet jaataa he, to vahi khilaadi sarv karnaa jari rakhata he, lekin use sarvice court badalanaa padataa he taaki vah baari-baari se harek pratidwandvi ke liye kaary karata he
 If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, then the player on the right service court serves; If odd, the player from the left service court serves
 pichhali raily ke aarambh main unki jagah ke aadhaar par hi khiladiyon ke sarvice court nirdhaarit hote hai, na ki raily ke ant main jahaan ve khadey the
 One consequence of this system is that every time a side gets a chance to serve, a player gets the opportunity to become a server who did not serve the last time
 jab sarwar sarv karata he, tab shatalkock virodhiyon ke court main short sarvice line ke paar janaa chahie varanaa ise chook maan liya jayega
 If the score has reached 20-all, the game continues until one side takes a two-point lead, a maximum of 30 points
 match ke aarambh main, ek sikaa uchhaala jaataa he
 Winners in this can decide whether they will serve or receive first, or which side of the court they would like to play before
 His opponents have to choose only the leftovers
 kam aupchaarik settings main, sikaa oochhaalane ke bajaay aksar hi ek shatalkock ko hit karke upar hawa main udaaya jaataa he, cork kaa sira jis ore ingit karata he wo paksh sarv karegaa
 In the subsequent game, the winner of the previous game serves first
 inhen rabers bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 If a team wins a game then they play once again and if they win once again, they win that match only, but if they lose then they have to win a match And have to play matches
 kisi bhi yugal khel kii pehali raily ke liye, serving jodi faisla kar sakati he ki koun pehle sarv karegaa or risiving jodi faisla kar sakati he ki koun pehle risive karegaa
 At the beginning of the second game, players have to change their ends; If the match reaches the third game, then they have to change their ends twice at the start of the game and again when the leading pair's score reaches 11 points
 sarwar or resiver ko seemaa rekha chhue bina apane sarvice court main rahanaa padataa he, jab tak ki sarwar shatalkock ko strike nahin karata
 anya do khilaadi apni ichha anusaar kahin bhi khadey rah sakate hai, tab tak jab tak ki ve virdohi sarwar yaa resiver kii nazar se dur hai
 Players win a rally by striking the shuttlecock and dropping it inside the opposing court's court boundary)
 khilaadi tab bhi ek raily jeet jaataa he jab virdohi koi galati karata he
 The most common mistake or fault in badminton is when the player fails to send the shuttlecock back and falls on the opposing court, but there are other ways players can be at fault
 kai galtiyaan vishesh rup se sarvice se sambandhit hai
 It will be the fault of the serving player if the shuttlecock is above his waist at the time of contact, or the head of his racket is not down at the time of impact
 yah vishesh niyam 2006 main sanshodhit hua: pehle, sarwar ke racket ko is had tak adhomukhi hona hota tha ki racket ke sir ko us haath se neeche rahanaa jaruri tha jisase racket ko pakadaa gaya he; or ab, samastar ke neeche koi bhi kone sweekaarya he
 Neither the server nor the receiver can lift one leg until the server strikes the shuttlecock
 The server will also initially have to hit the base of the shuttlecock, although it can later hit the winged part as part of the same stroke
 es-sarv yaa sidek sarv ke naam se khyath ek atyant prabhavi sarvice style ko pratibandhit karne ke liye yah kaanoon banaaya gaya
 Through this style, servers used to create disorganized spin in shuttlecock flights
 net ke paar waapas bhejne ke pehle har paksh shatalkock ko sirf ek hi baar strike kar saktaa he; lekin ek ekal stroke sanchalan ke dauraan koi khilaadi shatalkock ko do baar sampark kar saktaa he 
 However, a player cannot hit the shuttlecock once with a new move again, or he cannot hold or sling the shuttlecock
 agar shatalkock chat ko hit karata he to yah folt hoga
 If the lats occur, the rally is stopped and played again without any change in score
 kuch anpekshit baadha ke kaaran lats ho sakate hai, masalan shatalkock ke court main gir jane par yaa chote haul ke upree bhaag se shatal chhu jaae to ise lats kaha ja saktaa he
 If the receiver is not ready when served, it will be called Let's; However, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, it will be presumed ready
 agar shatalkock tepe ko hit karata he to vah lats nahin hoga | Badminton rackets are light, good quality racquets weigh between 79 and 91 grams with wire
 ye kai alag samagriyon carbon fibre mishran se lekar thos ispaat tak, vibhinn tarah ke padaarthon ke sanvardhan se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Carbon fiber provides an excellent strength to weight ratio, which is stiff and provides excellent transfer of kinetic energy
 carbon fibre mishran se pehle, racket halake dhaatuon jaise aluminium main banataa tha
 Earlier rackets were made of wood
 saste racket ab bhi aksar ispaat jaise dhaatu ke banate hai, lekin atyadhik maatra main lakdi lagane or isaki keemat ke kaaran ab saamaanya bazaar ke liye lakdi ke racket nahin banate hai
 Nowadays, nano materials such as fullerenes and carbon nanotubes are also being incorporated into rackets to provide greater durability
 racket dizin main bahut sari vividhtaayen hai, haalanki niyaman racket kaa sies or uske aakaar kii seemaa tay kar di gayi he
 Different players have different types of rackets to design the game
 paaramparik upree hissaa andakaar vaale racket abhi bhi uplabdh hai, lekin ek sammatrik aakaar kaa racket tezi se aam ho rahaa he
 They are very popular with most players
 badminton taar patale hote hai, bahut achche pradarshan vaale taar 0
65 se 0
73 mimi motaai kii range main hote hai
 Thicker strings are more durable, but most players prefer thinner strings
 taar kaa kasaav aamtaur par 80 se 130 n main hota he
 Hobbyist players usually have less tightness than professional, especially between 18 and 25 lb-force
 peshewar ke taar kaa kasaav lagbhag 25 or 36 pound-bal ke bich
 It is often argued that wire tightening improves control, while lower tension increases strength
 iske liye jo yukti di jaati he vah aamtaur kachche yantric tark ke taur par lagu hote hai, jaise ki kam kasaavvaale taar kaa aadhaar adhik oochaal dene vaala hota he or isliye adhik shakti pradaan karata he
 This is incorrect, in fact, due to a high tension wire the shuttle can slip through the racket and therefore it is difficult to hit the shot properly
 ek vikalp yah sujhata he ki takat ke liye sarvottam kasaav khilaadi par nirbhar karata he: sarvaadhik takat ke liye ucch kasaav se khilaadi apane racket ko adhik tezi se or adhik sateek taur par laharaa saktaa he
 Neither rigorous mechanical analysis is needed for any idea nor is there clear evidence in favor of it or the other
 ek khilaadi ke liye sabase prabhavi tarika he ki ek achche kasaavvaale taar kaa vah prayog kare
 The choice of grip or grip allows the player to increase the thickness of their racket fixture and choose a comfortable surface for grip
 antim parat chadhaane se pehle khilaadi ek yaa anek grip ke saath racket kaa muttha taiyaar kar saktaa he
 Players can choose between different types of grip material
 zyaadaatar PU synthetic grip yaa toweyling grip kaa hi chalan he
 The choice of grip is a matter of personal preference
 aksar khiladiyon ke liye pasinaa ek samasya he; is maamle main, grip yaa haath main ek drawing agent lagaaya ja saktaa he, sweatbands kaa istemaal ho saktaa he, khilaadi duusare kism kaa grip material chun saktaa he yaa grip ko baar-baar badal saktaa he
 There are two main types of grip: replacement grips and overgrips
 Replacement grips are thicker and are often used to increase the size of the pimples
 overgrips patale hote hai or aksar iskaa istemaal antim parat ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 However, many players prefer to use a replacement grip as the final layer
 toweyling grip hameshaa riplacement grip hote hai
 Replacement grips are adhesives, while overgrips are only small patches of adhesive at the beginning of the tape and must be applied based on tightness; Overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, as they can quickly replace the underlying content without spoiling
 shatalkock ek khulaa shanku aakaar kaa ooncha udanevaala prakshepya he: cork ke aadhaar main solah ativyapee antahsthapit pankhons se shanku banaaya jaataa he
 The cork is covered with fine leather or synthetic material
 chunki pankhons ke shatal aasaani se tut jate hai, isiilie aksar shaukia khilaadiyon dwaara apni laagat ko kam karne ke liye synthetic shatal kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 These nylon shuttles are made with either a natural cork or artificial foam base and plastic enclosure
 iske atirikt, nylon shatalkock teen kismon ke hote hai, harek kism alag tarah ke taapmaana ke liye hote hai
 They are of three types; For green, blue and red
 isliye cork ke chaaron taraf chipki rangeen pattee rang or gati kii ore sanket karti he
 Faster shuttles are used in colder temperatures and slower ones are chosen in warmer climates
 badminton juute vajan main halake rabar ke tale yaa milte-julate hai grip ke saath non-marking saamagree se bane hote hai
 Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes are slightly lateral recumbent
 ucch str kaa parshvik avlamban gatividhiyon ke liye vahaan upyogi he, jahaan parshv gati avaanchhneeya or apratyaashit he
 Nonetheless, badminton requires powerful lateral movements
 badminton main pair kii suraksha main ek ucch nirmit parshvik avlamban sakasham nahin hoga, iske bajaae, aisi jagah par jahaan juute ko avlamban nahin mil paata yah vipattijanak rup se girane kaa sabab ban jayega or khilaadi ke takhne achaanak bhaar ke liye taiyaar na hon to yah moch kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 For this reason, badminton players should opt for badminton shoes over general trainee or runner shoes, as exact badminton shoes have a very thin bottom, lowering a person's center of gravity and therefore less scope for injury
 it occurs
 har tarah ke dhakke main khilaadiyon ko surakshit or uchit kadamon ke upyog ke saath ghutane or pairon ke sanrekhan ko bhi sunishchit karnaa chahie
 This is not only a concern for safety, it is also important to use appropriate steps to maintain speed in the court
 badminton main bahut saare buniyadi stroke hai or prabhavi dhang se pradarshan ke liye khilaadiyon ko bahut hi ucch str ke kaushal kii aavashyaktaa he
 All strokes can be played with either forehand or backhand
 ek khilaadi kaa forehand said uske khilne vaale haath kaa hi said hota he: daaen haath ke khilaadi ke liye forehand said uskaa dahinaa said hota he or bacand said uskaa baayan said hota he
 The forehand stroke from the dominant palm is struck from the front of the right hand, while the backhand stroke is struck from the back of the right hand
 khilaadi aksar forehand said kii ore se bacand maarane ke saath kuch stroke khelte hai or iskaa ulta bhi
 In the front court and middle court, most strokes can be played in the same effective manner, either from the forehand or backhand side; But from the back of the court the player attempts to play as many strokes as possible from his forehand, often preferring to play forehand overhead rather than backhand overhead
 ek bacand overhead khilne ke do mukhya nuksaan hai
 First of all, the player must turn his back towards his opponents, which makes him unable to see them and the court
 duusare, bacand overheads utani takat ke saath nahin maaraa ja saktaa jitna ki forehand: kandhe ke jod ke kaaran maarane kii karrwai simit ho jaati he, jo bacand ke bajaae forehand overhead sanchaalan ke bahut bade range kii anumati detaa he
 Most players and coaches in the game consider the backhand clear to be a hard basic stroke, as precise technique is required in order to muster enough power to travel the entire length of the shuttlecock court
 usee kaaran se, bacand smash kamjor ho jate hai
 The choice of stroke depends on how close the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above the height of the net, and where the opponent's current position is: if they can reach the shuttlecock above the height of the net, players are better off
 Occur in the event of an attack

 The gymnastic jump smash, where the player jumps upward for a downward smash angle, is a common and spectacular element of the elite men's doubles game
 rurcourt main, shatalkock ko neeche kii ore aane dene ke bajaae khiladi us samay maarane ke liye bekaraar hota he jab vah unke upar hota he
 This overhead stroke allows them to play a variety of smashes, clears, and dropshots
 agar shatalkock thoda neeche aata he, to smash asambhav he or sampurna lambaai, ooncha clear mushkil he
 When the shuttlecock is well below the height of the net, players have no choice but to hit upwards
 lifts jahaan virodhiyon ke court ke peeche le jane ke liye shatalkock upar kii taraf maaraa jaataa he, court ke kisi bhi hisse se khelaa ja saktaa he
 If the player does not lift, he is left with the option of gently moving the shuttlecock to the net: in the four courts it is called net short, in mid-court it is often called push or block
 jab shatalkock net kii oonchai ke kareeb hota he, khilaadi drivs hit kar sakate hai, joki sapaat or virodhiyon ke midcourt tathaa rear court main tezi se net ke upar se jaataa he
 The push may hit even more flat, moving the shuttlecock in front of the midcourt
 drivs or push midcourt yaa forcourt se khele ja sakate hai or iskaa upyog aksar dubles main hota he: aisa ve shatalkock ko lift karne yaa smash se bachaav kii koshish ke bajaae ve hamale ko phir se praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 After a successful push or drives, opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock
 smash se bachaav karne ke dauraan, khilaadi ke paas teen buniyadi vikalp hote hai : lift, block, yaa drive
 ekal main, net main block bahut hi saamaanya javaabi kaarywahi he
 In doubles, a lift is the safest option, but it usually allows the opponents to consistently smash; Block and drive are combat strokes, but can be intercepted by the smash partner
 bahut saare khilaadi donon forehand or bacand said main smash ko lautaane ke liye bankehand hit karte hai, kyonki sidhe sharir par aate hue smash ke liye forehand ke bajaae bacand kahin adhik prabhavi hota he
 The service is restricted by rule and it offers arrays to choose their own type of stroke
 tennis ke vipareet, sarwar kaa racket sarv dene ke dauraan neeche kii disha main nishaanaa sadhate hue hona chahie saamanyatya shatal upar kii ore maaraa janaa chahie taaki vah net par se gujaarey
 sarwar forcourt main lo sarv kaa, yaa sarvice court ke peeche main lift kaa, yaa ek sapaat drive sarv kaa chunaav kar saktaa he
 The lift serve must be either a high serve, where the shuttlecock rises so high that it falls behind the court in an almost steep direction, or a fly serve, where the shuttlecock rises to a lower altitude but collapses soon
 ek baar khiladi ko in buniyadi stroke main maharath hasil kar lete hai, tab ve shatalkock ko court ke kisi bhi hisse main puri takat se or dhire se jaisaa jaruri ho, hit ke sakate hai
 In addition to the basics, however, badminton offers good potential for advanced stroke applying skills that give a competitive advantage
 kyonki badminton khilaadiyon ko jaldi se jaldi ho sake kam se kam duuri ko tay karnaa padataa he, iskaa uddeshy virodi ko kai bahut hi unnat stroke dena hota he, taaki yaa to vah is chaal main pad jaae ki ek alag stroke khelaa gaya he, yaa vah sahi myne main shatal kii disha dekhne tak apni gati dhimaa karne ko majaboor ho jaae
 badminton main aksar in donon tareeke se "chalbaaji" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 When the player actually does the trick, often he will lose the same point because he cannot change his direction so quickly to reach the shuttlecock
 Experienced players will be mindful of the move and will be conscious of making the move very soon, but trick attempts are still useful, as it forces the opponent to slow down their pace
 kamjor khilaadi jo stroke maaranevaala hota he, anbhavi khilaadi us stroke se laabh uthaane ke makasad se uske shatalkock ko hit karne se pehle hi chal padataa he
 Slicing and shothanded hitting action are two main technical tools that facilitate trickery
 slising shatalkock ko racket ke saamne kii ore se kone banaate hue maarane se sambandhit he, jisase yah sharir or baajuon dwaara sujhaaye gayi sanchalan ke bajaae alag disha main jaataa he
 Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to be much slower than the speed shown by the arms
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek acha crosscourt sliced dropshort jo shatalkock kii kshamta or disha donon hi virdohi ko thagte hue jor se maarane kii kaarywahi kaa upyog karegaa jo sidhe clear yaa smash hota he
 a very sophisticated slicing operation involves brushing the wire around it to rotate the shuttlecock when it hits
 iskaa istemaal net se hokar bahut hi tezi se guzarate hue gaharaai main le jate hue shatal ke prakshep path main vruddhi karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he; udhaaharan ke liye, sliced lo sarv saamaanya lo sarv kii tulana main thodaa jaldi yatra kar saktaa he, phir bhi usee jagah girtaa he
 The shuttlecock also creates a spinning netshort in which the shuttlecock rotates several times before stabilizing; Sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of rolling
 spinning netshort kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki jab tak shatalkock kaa ludhakna band nahin ho jaataa he virdohi use lenaa nahin chahega, kyonki pankhon main maarane kaa nateeja apratyaashit stroke hota he
 Spinning netshots are of special importance for a high level solo player
 aadhunik racket kaa halkaapan khilaadi ko kai stroke ke liye aakhri sambhavit kshan tak shaktishaalee yaa halkaa stroke maarane ke vikalp ko banaaye rakhane ke liye short hiting karrwai ke istemaal karne kii anumati detaa he
 For example, a single player may hold his racket for a netshort, but then flick the shuttlecock back instead of a shallow lift
 isse bade hit se lift karne ke bajaae puure court ko cover karte hue swing karana virdohi ke liye kathin kaam hota he
 a short hitting action is not useful for trickery: it allows the player to hit powerful strokes when there is no time for a large arm swing
 aise takneekon main majboot grip bahut myne rakhata he or ise aksar finger power ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 Elite players develop finger power to an extent so that they can hit some powerful strokes, such as net kills by swinging the racket less than 10 cm
 soft stroke khilne ke liye hiting karrwai ke dhime ho jane se pehle shaktishaalee stroke ke dwaara chalbaasike is style ko ulat dena bhi sambhav he
 The rear style of trickery is generally common in the rearcourt, while the latter style is very common in the forecourt and midcourt
 chalbaazi slising or short hiting karrwai tak simit nahin he
 The player may also use double motion where the racquet is initially operated in one direction before saving the racket from hitting in the other direction
 aamtaur par yah crosscourt kone ke istemaal kaa suzav detaa he, lekin stroke ko sidhaa yaa iske ulat kheltaa he
 Triple motion is also possible, but it is very rare in real sports
 racket ke upree hisse kaa nakli istemaal dabl moshan kaa ek vikalp he, jahaan praarambhik gati jari rahete hue bhi hit ke dauraan racket gum jaataa he
 This makes a slight change in direction, but it does not require much time
 badminton main jeet ke liye, khilaadiyon ko sahi sthiti main vibhinn tarah ke stroke kii zaroorat hoti he
 Its range is from powerful jumps to smashes to subtle tumbling to return from the net
 aksar reliyon kaa ant smash se hota he, lekin smash ko sthapit karne ke liye teevr stroke kii zaroorat he
 For example, a netshort may force the adversary to lift the shuttlecock, providing an opportunity for smash
 agar netshort tang or ludhaknevaala he to virdohi kaa lift court ke peeche tak pahunch jayega, jo vaapasi ke liye anuvarthi smash ko bahut kathin bana detaa he
 Deception is also important
 visheshgy khilaadi ke kai tarah ke stroke taiyaar karte hai, jo ek jaise dikhte hai or gati yaa stroke kii disha ke bare main apane virodhiyon ko dhokhe main daalane ke liye ve slising kaa upyog karte hai
 If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may go in the wrong direction and be unable to change his body's speed to reach the shuttlecock at the right time
 donon jodi jab kabhi sambhav ho neeche kii ore smash karke laabh uthaane or hamale ko barkaraar rakhane kii koshish karegaa
 Whenever possible, the pair will create an ideal attack array, with one player hitting the bottom from the rearcourt and his partner returning the lift in the midcourt, stopping all smashes in between
 If the attacker of the rearcourt plays a dropshot, his partner will move towards the forecourt, taking the risk of going to the forecourt
 If the pair cannot hit, they will use flat strokes to try to take advantage of the attack
 agar jodi shatalkock ko lift yaa clear karne ko majaboor kar di jaati he to unhen bachaav karnaa chahie: ve rear midcourt main ve virdohi ke smash kaa muqabla karne ke liye apane court kii puri chaudaai ko cover karne ke liye paas-paas rahane kii sthiti ko apanaayenge
 yugal khel main, khilaadi aamtaur par bich maidan main do khiladiyon ke bich bhram or takaraav kaa laabh uthaane ke liye smash karata he
 In high level sports, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serve is almost never seen in professional sports
 virdohi ko hamale se laabh uthaane se rokane kii koshish main sidhe lo sarv kaa bahut adhik istemaal hone laga he
 Flick serve is used to prevent the opponent from already expecting Lo Serve and attacking decisively
 ucch str ke khel main yugal raily bahut hi tej hota he
 Men's doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton, with high proportions jumping and smashing full force
 ekal court yugal court kii tulana main sankara hota he, lekin lambaai main ek samaan, sarv main ekal or yugal main back box baahar hota he
 Because one person is required to cover the entire court, the single strategy is based on forcing the opponent to walk as much as possible; This means that a single stroke is usually associated with the corner of the court
 drapeshort or netshort ke saath lift or clear ke sangyojan se khilaadi court kii puri lambaai kaa phayda uthaata he
 Smashes are less common in singles than in doubles, as players are rarely in the ideal position to smash, and if the smash returns, smashers are often hurt
 ekal main, khilaadi zyaadaatar forehand hai sarv ke saath raily kii shuruuaat karegaa
 Constant low serve either forehand or backhand is also used
 flik sarv kam hi hota he or drive sarv to viral hi he
 In high level sports, singles require significant fitness
 yugal ke bahut hi akraamakata ke vipareet, ekal dhairyavan sthitijanya daanv kaa khel he
 In mixed doubles, both the pair try to maintain aggression with the woman in the front and the man in the back
 iskaa kaaran yah he purush khilaadiyon jo kaaphi majboot hote hai or isliye ve jo smash karte hai vah bahut hi shaktishaalee hota hai
 As a result, mixed doubles require strategic awareness and a more nuanced situational play
 chaalaak virdohi mahila ko peeche kii taraf or purush ko aage kii ore aane ke liye majaboor karte hue unki adarsh sthiti ko badalane kii koshish karegaa
 To avoid this danger, the mixed player has to be alert and systematic in choosing his shot
 ucch str ke khel main, sanrachana aamtaur par lacheelee hoti he: chotii kii mahila khilaadi riercourt se puri takat ke saath khilne main sakasham hoti he or jab isaki zaroorat ho to vah khushi-khushi aisa kar legi
 baharhaal, jab mauka miltaa he, mahila ko samaane kii taraf rakhkar jodi phir se maanak mishrit aakraamak sthiti main jaaegi
 The left-handed player gets a natural advantage against the right-handed player
 aisa isliye ki duniya main zyaadaatar daahine haath ke khilaadi hai 
 If you play with the left hand, the forehand and backhand change, so a shot in the court on your right will result in a very powerful smash against you
 is kaaran baayen haath ke khiladiyon kaa jhukaav unke forehand kii taraf adhik se adhik shot daalane kaa hoga or falswaroop unka bankehand puri tarah se prashikshit nahin hota he
 Therefore, the main weakness of a left-handed player is his backhand
 yah jaanane ke baad, baayen haath ke ek khilaadi ko apane zyaadaatar shots court ke baayen ore khilne kii koshish kerani chahie
 This is because despite the right-hand man's forehand, the return of the shot to your forehand will ensure that you can continue smashing
 yah kaha jaataa he ki baayen haathwaalon ke smashes behatar hote hai
 This is partly true because the left-handed player is able to make rare angles and also because the wings on the shuttlecock are positioned in a way that helps the left-handed player
 haalanki, ek baayen haath kaa khilaadi khud uljhan main pad jayega, jab vah ek samakaksh saathi ke saath khel rahaa ho
 Left-handed / right-handed doubles pairings are very common in advanced level games
 isaki vajah yah he ki inhen daahine haath / daahine haath yaa baayen haath / baayen haath kii yugal jodi par ek vishisht laabh praapt hota he
 The most notable benefit is that none of the side of the court is weak
 isse virdohi team ko yah sochane main adhik samay lagata he ki koun-si said bacand he or shatalkock ko vahaan bhejnaa he, kyonki ek saamaanya dahini / dahini jodi ke viruddh aap aamtaur par lagbhag hameshaa court ke aapaki dahini ore hi bhejte hai, jabaki LH / RH jodi raily ke dauraan apane kamjor paksh main parivartan kar liya karti he
 The left-handed player also has another advantage in smashing
 chidiya ke pankh ke shatalkock main ek prakritik spin hota he, isliye jab baayen haath se shatalkock ko halake se tirchhe shot lagaate hai tab aap prakritik spin kaa laabh uthaate hue use draig karke tej smash karte hai
 The same effect occurs when a right-handed player slices a shot with his backhand
 iskaa ek bahut acha udhaaharan ten boon heong hai, jo ek baayen haath ke khilaadi hai, jinke naam 421 kimi / ghanta kaa vishwa record he

 badminton main sabase shaktishaalee stroke smash he, jo tezi se neeche kii taraf virodhiyon ke mid court main maaraa jaataa he
 The maximum speed of a smashed shuttlecock is much higher than any other racket sport projectile
 khilaadi ke racket se chhootane ke tatkaal baad is gati kii recording ko shatalkock kii praarambhik gati se mapa jaataa he
 In the men's doubles at the 2009 Japan Open, Malaysian player Tan Boon Yong made an official world record of 421 km / h
 badminton kii tulana aksar tennis se kii jaati he
 a list of non-controversial comparisons is as follows: smash gati jaisi sankhyikee 261 mile / ghanta, usase adhik, furtile badminton utsaahiyon kii anya tulanaayen adhik vivaadaaspad hai
 For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racket sport
 haalanki racket ke khelon main sabase tej aarambhik gati kaa record badminton ke naam he, anya prakshepya jaise ki tennis gendon kii tulana main vaastavik rup se shatalkock kaa avamandan kaaphi tej hota he
 In addition, this ability must be judged by the distance the shuttlecock has to travel: a smashed shuttlecock travels a short distance from a tennis ball during one's serve
 sabase tej racket ke khel ke rup main badminton kaa daawa bhi pratikriya samay kii aavashyaktaaon ke aadhaar par ho saktaa he, lekin yakeenan teble tennis main isse tej pratikriya samay bhi aavashyaktaa he
 There is a strong argument in favor that badminton demands far more physical ability than tennis, but such comparisons are difficult to objectify given the varying demands of sports
 kuch anaupchaarik adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki badminton ko tennis khiladiyon se adhik aerobics kshamta kii zaroorat he, lekin is vishay par bahut kade shodh nahin kiye gaye hai
 a more balanced approach has been suggested in the following comparison, although these are also the subject of controversy: badminton or tennis kii takanic kaaphi alag hai
 The lightness of the shuttlecock and the badminton allow the player to use the wrist and fingers more than the tennis players of the racket; In tennis, the wrist is usually fixed and rotating the wrist can cause injury
 isi ek hi kaaran se, badminton khilaadi racket ke chote swing se takat paidaa kar sakate hai: aisa hi stroke jaise net kil, main bade khilaadi 5 se
me
 se bhi kam swing kar sakate hai
 a stroke that requires more strength will usually use a longer swing, but a badminton racket will rarely swing like a tennis swing
 aksar yah kaha jaataa he ki badminton stroke mukhya rup se kalai se lage jaati he
 This is a misconception and can be criticized for two reasons
 pehali, ise ekadam se varg truti kaha ja saktaa he: kalai kii ek jod he, mansapeshi nahin, baanh kii mansapeshiyaan isaki harakat ko niyantrit karti hai
 Second, wrist movements are weaker than forward or upper arm movements
 badminton jaev yantriki vistrut vaigyanik adhyayan kaa vishay nahin he, lekin kuch adhyayan bijli utpaadan main kalai kii choti si bhoomika kii pushti karte hai or isse sanket miltaa he ki upree or nichali baanh ke aantarik or bahya ghurnan main takat kii pramukh bhoomika hoti he
 Modern coaching resources such as the Badminton England Technique DVD illustrate these ideas by emphasizing the forearm rather than wrist movements
 gendon kaa istemaal honevaale zyaadaatar duusare racket ke khelon se shatalkock bahut hi alag he
 The wing provides strong drag, thus causing the shuttlecock to fall far away from the thrust
 shatalkock bhi tej vayugatika se sthir hota he: praarambhik rukh kii parvaah kiye bina, yah cork kii ore se pehle gum kar udega or cork kii ore iskaa rukh rahegaa
 a key to the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires enough skill to hit the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racket sports
 draig shatalkock ke upar uthe hue udan maarg ko bhi prabhavit karata he: iske udan kaa paravalay bahut adhik tirachha hokar yah upar uthne ke bajaae ek dhalaan vaale kone se hokar girtaa he
 Even with a very high serve, the shuttlecock can fall perpendicularly
 apni oochaal main parivartan ke liye gend gum sakati he, or khilaadi is tarah ke spin ke liye slis kar saktaa he ; chunki shatalkock uchhalane kii anumati nahin detaa he, isliye yah badminton main lagu nahin hota he
 Slice the shuttlecock so that it rotates, although it is used and some are specifically for badminton
 uske pankh paraspar ek duusare par is tarah se lage hote hai ki shatalkock prakritik rup se apni dhuree par golai main chakkar lagate hue ghumta he
 When the shuttlecock falls, it rotates counter-clockwise as shown above
 prakritik rup se ghoomane ke kaaran kuch stroke ko prabhavit hote hai: agar slising ection baae se dahini ore ke bajaae daahine se baayin ore ho to tambling netshot kahin adhik prabhavi hota he

 legal considerations ]]mukhya lekh : Construction law a construction project must fit the governing legal framework of the property
 inamen sampatti ke upyog par sarkari niyam or daayitv shaamil hote hai, jo nirmaan kii prakriya ke dauraan nirmit hote hai
 The project has to comply with segmentation and building code requirements in the areas
 jis pariyojna main code kaa paalan karne main vifaltaa hasil hoti he, usamen maalik ko phayda nahin hoga
 kuch kanoonee aavashyaktaaen agyaat kaarnon se paidaa hoti hai yaa pul ke gir jane yaa visphot jaise nirvivaad kharaab sthitiyon se nipatane kii ichha ke dauraan padati he
 Other legal requirements may arise from possible conditions and things, such as custom or expectation, such as the separation of commercial buildings into commercial districts and residential buildings into residential districts
 a lawyer may ask for a change or exemption in the applicable law in the country where the building is to be constructed, such as he may argue that this rule is unenforceable, or that custom laws are not required
 ek nirmaan pariyojna anubandhon or anya kanoonee dayitvon kaa ek jatil jaal he, jinamein se prayek par dhyaan se vichaar kiya janaa chahie

 nirmaan main samay tatv kaa matlab he ki der hone se laagat badhati he or baadhaon ke maamalon main der bahut mahangi pad sakati he
 Thus, the contract should be done in such a way as to ensure that each party is capable of discharging its obligations

 The legal framework should be such that the design can be integrated into the surrounding legal framework and it can affect the financial results of the construction process
 ek graahak ke bhawan ko praapt karne ke liye dwaara kii jane vaali gatividhiyon ke vilay ko kharid kaha ja saktaa he
 There are many different methods of construction procurement, although the three most common types of procurement are: traditional design and construction contact management kharid ke nae roopon kii sankhya bhi bad rahi he, jisamen sambhddha anubandh shaamil hota he or jahaan ek nirmaan pariyojna ke bheetar mukhya maalik, thekedaar or anya hitdharakon ke bich sahakaari sambandhon par jor hota he
 New forms include partnerships such as public-private partnerships aka private finance initiatives and alliances such as "pure" or "project" alliances and "impure or" strategic "alliances

 Traditional Main article: Design-bid-build is nirmaan kharid kaa sabase aam tarika he or acchhee tarah se sthapit or manyata praapt he
 In this arrangement, the engineer or architect serves as the project coordinator
 uske yaa uski bhoomika kaam kii dizin karnaa, vinirdeshon taiyaar karnaa, nirmaan kii drawing pesh karnaa, anubandh prashasan, kaam shuru karnaa or shuru se lekar aakhir tak kaam kaa prabandhan karnaa he
 The architect has a direct contractual relationship between the client and the main contractor
 kisi upathekedaar kaa mukhya thekedaar ke saath ek sidhaa sanvidatmak sambandh hota he
 Design and construction Main article: Design-build yah drushtikon haal ke varshon main kaaphi aam ho gaya he or isamen fikschar, fitting or anya aavashyak upkarnon sahit samoochaa purna package shaamil hota he, jisase ek puri tarah kaaryaatmak imaarat taiyaar hoti he

 When they are working on Phase 1, they design Phase 2
 yah dizin bid-bilt anubandh ke vipareet he, jahaan pariyojna kii dizin puri tarah se maalik dwaara banaayi jaati he or tab boli lagati he or nirmaan puraa kiya jaataa he
 Director of the Engineering for the National Asphalt Pavement Association Kent Kinsen said that the government's transportation departments usually use design-build contractors to complete projects if governments do not have the funds
 In DOTS, design-build contracts are commonly used for large projects
 prabandhan pranaaliyon kii kharidmukhya lekh : Construction management In this arrangement, the customer plays an active role in the procurement system by entering into separate contracts with the designer architect or engineer construction manager and individual business contractors
 graahak sanvidatmak bhoomika apanaataa he, jabaki nirmaan yaa pariyojna prabandhak alag vyapaar anubandhon ke prabandhan ke liye sakriy bhoomika adaa karata he or yah sunishchit karata he ki ve sabhi sucharu rup se or prabhavi rup se ek saath kaam karen
 Management procurement systems are often used to speed up procurement processes, giving the customer greater flexibility to design changes throughout the contract, giving it the ability to appoint individual work contractors, throughout the contract During each individual has a separate contractual obligation and this gives the customer greater control

 This bacterium is spread among individuals by bacteria expelled by respiration

 Now the question arises that how is this disease transmitted from one child to another? Children suffering from this disease have runny nose, sneeze and cough

 In order to leave the nose, mouth and breath during a cough or sneeze, the bacteria spreads to the surroundings and the environment, which causes infection in other children

 internet movie database par dwen johnson Low-temperature is the branch of frost-physics or experimental physics that studies the application of extremely low temperatures and its applications
 cryogenic kaa udgam unani shabd cryos se bana he jiskaa arth hota he sheet yani barf kii tarah sheethal
 This branch is operated at temperature
 is nimna taapmaana kaa upyog karne vaali prakriyaaon or upayon kaa cryogenic abhiyantriki ke antargat adhyayan karte hai
 It is seen here what kind of changes occur in metals and gases at low temperatures
 kai dhaatuen kam taapmaana par pehle se adhik thos ho jaati hai
 In simple terms, it is the science of studying the surprising behavior of metals at cool temperatures
 isaki ek shakha main electronic tatwon par prashithan ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan or anya main manushyon or paudhon par prashithan ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Some scientists consider frost biology as a whole by combining low temperature preparation methods, while others study the changes in metals at low temperatures
 cryogenics main adhyayan kiye jane vaale taapmaana kaa paraas kaaphi adhik hota he
 According to some scientists, it is studied only at temperatures below -180 ° F
 yah taapmaana jal ke prashithan bindu se kaaphi neeche hota he or jab dhaatuon ko is taapmaana tak laayaa jaataa he to un par ascharyajanak prabhaav dikhaai dete hai
 There are some ways of preparing such a low temperature, such as a special type of refrigerant or liquid gas like nitrogen, which can control the temperature under favorable pressure conditions
 dhaatuon ko tusharajaniki dwaara thande kiye jane par unke anuon kii kshamta badhati he
 This makes that metal stronger and stronger than before
 is vidhi se kai tarah kii aushadhiyaan taiyaar kii jaati hai or vibhinn dhaatuon ko sangrakshit bhi kiya jaataa he
 Cryogenic fuels are also used in rockets and spacecraft
 tusharajaniki kaa prayog ji es el ve rocket main bhi kiya jaataa he
 GSLV In liquid fuel engines used in rockets, fuel is filled at very low temperatures, hence such engines are called cryogenic rocket engines
 is tarah ke rocket ingine main atyadhik thandi or draveekrut gaison ko eendhan or oxikaarak ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Hydrogen and fuel in this engine act as fuel and oxidizer respectively
 thos eendhan kii apeksha ye kai guna shaktishaalee siddh hote hai or rocket ko boost dete hai
 This technique is required especially for long range and heavy rockets
 tusharajaniki sangrakshan kii ek shakha ko cryonic kehete hai
 It is possible that through it, the bodies of humans and animals can be preserved in refrigeration in the future by medical technology
 aisa niyantrit paristhitiyon main hi karnaa sambhav hoga
