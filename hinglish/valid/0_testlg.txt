 In connection with this Jyotirlinga, this story is described by the Puranas- supriy naamak ek bada dharmatma or sadaachari vaisya tha
 He was an exclusive devotee of Lord Shiva
 vah nirantar unki aradhana, pujan or dhyaan main tallin rahata tha
 He used to do all his work by offering it to Lord Shiva
 man, vachan, karm se vah purnatah shivarchan main hi tallin rahata tha
 Due to his devotion to Shiva, a demon named Daruk lived very crudely
 use bhagavan shiv kii yah puja kisi prakaar bhi acchhee nahin lagati thi
 He used to constantly try to ensure that there was an obstacle in the worship of that beloved person
 ek baar supriy nauka par savaar hokar kahin ja rahaa tha
 The evil demon Daruk, seeing this opportune occasion, attacked the boat
 usne nauka main savaar sabhi yatriyon ko pakadakar apni rajdhani main le jaakar kaid kar liya
 According to his routine in the Supriya prison, he started worshiping Lord Shiva
 anya bandi yatriyon ko bhi vah shiv bhakthi kii prerana dene laga
 When Daruk heard this news about his beloved from his servants, he became very angry and came to that prison
 supriy us samay bhagavan shiv ke charnon main dhyaan lagaae hue donon ankhen band kiye baitha tha
 Seeing this pose of that monster, scolding him in a very fierce voice said- 'hey wicked Vaishya! You are closing your eyes and thinking about what disturbance and conspiracy here? ' Even after he said this, the tomb of the divine Shiva devotee Supriya was not broken
 ab to vah daruk rakshas krodh se ekadam pagal ho uthaa
 He immediately ordered his followers to kill Supriya and all the other prisoners
 supriy uske is aadesh se jaraa bhi vichlit or bhaybheet nahin hua
 He started praying to Lord Shiva for the liberation of himself and other prisoners from the concentrated mind
 use yah purna vishwaas tha ki mere aradhy bhagavan shivaji is vipatti se mujhe avashya hi chhutkaaraa dilaayenge
 Hearing his prayers, Lord Shankarji immediately appeared as a Jyotirlinga, situated on a shining throne in a high place in that prison
 unhone is prakaar supriy ko darshan dekar use apana pashupat-astr bhi pradaan kiya
 With this weapon, after killing the demon Daruk and his assistant, Supriya went to Shivdham
 bhagavan shiv ke aadeshaanusaar hi is jyotirling kaa naam nageshwar padaa

 In the first week of class, Will tackles a graduate-level question of algebraic graph theory that was left as a challenge to students on the chalkboard by Gerald Lambieu, a Fields medalist and professor specializing in combinatorics
 Hopefully someone will solve it by the end of the level
 jab yah jaldi or gumnaam rup se sulajhaa liya gaya, lambiyu ne ek or adhik mushkil sawaal saamne rakh diya-jise sabit karne main unhen or unke sahyogiyon ko do saal lage the
 When Lambu sees Ittakan writing Will on the board, he considers him a destroyer and drives him away
 haalanki, lambiyu ko yah ehsaas hota he ki vil ne sahi jawaab likhaa tha or ve use dhundne nikal padate hai
 Meanwhile, Will retaliates with a domineering Carmine Scarpeglia who, according to Will, killed him in Kindergarten years ago, now serving a prison sentence for assaulting a police officer acting in an attack
 vil kii vishaal kshamtaaon ko samajhate hue, lambiyu, vil ke mukademe main uske sthaan par hastkshep karte hai or vil ke samaksh do raste rakhte hai: yaa to jail jaao, yaa lambiyu ke vyaktigat paryvekshan ke tahat ganit kaa adhyayan karo or ek chikitsak se milo
 Will chooses the last option, since he did not believe he needed therapy
 lambiyu dwaara bulaae gaye pehle paanch chikitsakon kii vil ne avmaananaa kii
 In desperation, Lambieu finally calls Car Sean Maguire, his roommate at MIT and now an estranged old friend who grew up in Will's neighborhood
 Shawn differed from former physicians in the fact that he persevered against Will and was eventually able to overcome Will's hostile, sarcastic defense style
 ek vinaashkari pehali mulaakaat ke baad jo vil dwaara uski patni kaa apmaan kiye jane par, shaun ke vil ko dhakka dene or dhamkee dene par khatm hui, ke baavjood shaun haar maanane se inkaar karata he or kuch anutpaadak satron ke baad antat vil uske saath khulne lagata he
 Will is particularly stunned when Sean tells him how he only gives the tickets he bought to watch the Boston Red Foxes play in the sixth game of the 1975 World Series so that he can meet and talk to a stranger at once
 Who could later become his wife
 yah vil ko skylar ke saath sambandh sthapit karne ke liye protsaahit karata he, jo ek jawan angrez mahila he jisase vah purv main harvard vishvavidhyalay ke paas ke ek baar main mila tha, jahaan vah ek antim varsh kii chaatr he or - jald hi snaatak ho jaaegi This doctor-patient relationship, however, is not one-sided
 vil shaun ko chunauti detaa he ki vah apane jivan main ek sakht, uddeshyaatmak nazar daale
 Sean was unable to cope with the accident of his beloved wife's premature death from cancer two years ago
 jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya, shaun, vil ko pasand karne lage or unhone yah mahasoos kiya ki, apane achche iraadon ke baavjood, lambiyu vil par kaaphi zyaada dabaav daal rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Lambu's expectations of Will get irritated to Will and he eventually refuses to go to the job interview scheduled by Lambu
 lambiyu vyathit hokar shaun kaa saamana karte hai or achaanak vil vahaan pahunch jaataa he jab ve uske bhavishya ko lekar ugrthapurvak lad rahe hote hai
 Will is distracted by seeing them fight themselves, making a point, though Shawn tells him that their real fight is long gone
 skylar ne vil ko uske saath california chalane ko kaha, jahaan vah stenford main ek chikitsa skool shuru karegi
 Will is horrified at the idea and pushes him
 vil apni sachhee kahani bataata he or yah bhi ki usne use dhokaa diya he
 Skylar sympathizes with her past and says that she loves him under all circumstances, but this leads to a tantrum and Will swiftly exits the hostel
 vah lambiyu ke liye kar rahe kaam ko ke "ek majaak" kah kar uda detaa he
 Lambieu pleads with Will not to ruin everything, but Will goes out
 shaun kahata he ki apane parsparik sambandhon main bhavishya kii asafalataa ko bhaanpane main vil itnaa nipun he ki vah yaa to unhen asafal hone detaa he yaa jaanboojhkar kar chhod detaa he, taaki vah bhaavnaatmak dard ke jokhim se khud ko bachaa sake
 When Will refuses to give Sean a sincere answer to Sean's question about what he wants to do with his life, Sean, annoyed, tells Will to walk out the door
 vil apane sabase achche dost chaki ko bataata he ki vah apni baaki zindagi majdoor bananaa chahta he
 Chucky becomes brutally honest with Will; He feels humiliated knowing that Will wants to ruin his ability
 vah vil se kahata he, "tum khud ke rini nahin ho
 tum mere rini ho
 kyonki kal main uthunga or dekhuunga ki main pachaas kaa ho gaya
 And i will still be doing the same 


 You are sitting on a won lottery ticket 


 because i can do anything to get what you have 


 It would be an insult to us if you were twenty You stay here even after years
 Walking around here is a waste of your time
 " vah kahata he ki uski sabase badi ichha he ki ek ek subah vah vil ke daravaaje par dastak de or dekhe ki vah vahaan nahin he
 Will goes to another therapeutic session, where he and Sean share that they were both victims of physical child abuse
 shaun tab vil se sachai ke saath uttar dene ke liye kahata he or usase baar-baar kahata he, "yah tumhaari galati nahin he"
 pehle pahal vil nakaaratmak bhav se jawaab dete hue kahata he "haa, mujhe pataa he" lekin baar-baar kehane ke baad, rone lagata he or shaun use tasalli detaa he
 Finally, after much self-contemplation, Will stands up against his inner demon and decides to take the reins of his life into his own hands
 iske turant baad, shaun duniya kii yatra karne ke liye ek vishram letaa he or apane karyaalay ko sametane lagata he jab lambiyu vahaan aata he
 The two become friends in a reconciliation and go out for a drink, where on the way they have a friendly dispute over Sean's habit of buying lottery tickets
 jab uske dost uske 21wein janmdin par use ek punarnirmit shevarle nova dete hai, to vil, apane laabhprad korporate or sarkari naukari ke aamantran ko darkinar karte hue skylar ko khojane kaa faisla karata he
 Concurrent to the scene in which Will leaves, Chucky knocks at Will's door and Chucky smiles when he gets no answer
 vil, shaun ke liye ek sankshipt note chhod detaa he, jisamen vah khud shaun ke ek taane kaa upyog karata he, "yadi professor us kaam ke bare main poochta he, to bas usase kah do, maaf kijiyegaa, mujhe ek ladki ko dhundhane janaa he
 "sean laughs jokingly and tells himself that Will" stole my line
 "then Will then heads west to Mass Pike

 Later, Castle Rock Entertainment president Rob Rainer urged him to remove the thriller aspect from his story and focus on the relationship between Will Hunting and his psychologist
 At Rainer's request, noted screenwriter William Goldman read the plot and further suggested that Will's decision to move to California behind his girlfriend Skylar should be the film's climax

 film kii patakatha ko parivartit kiya gaya or miramax ne kaisal rock se iske adhikaar kharid liye
 After purchasing the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax cleared the production of the film
 In fact, many well-known filmmakers considered directing the film, including Mel Gibson, Michael Mann, and Steven Soderbergh
 multah aflake ne kevin smith se poocha ki kya ve is film kaa nirdesan karne ke icchhuk the, smith ne is prastaav ko yah kehete hue manaa kar diya ki unhen ek "achche nirdeshak" kii aavashyaktaa he or yah bhi kaha ki ve keval swalikhit chizein hi nirdeshit karte hai or ve ek achche drishy nirdeshak nahin hai
 Affleck and Damon later chose Gus Van Sant, whose earlier work in the drugstore Cowboys left a favorable impression on both of these inexperienced screenwriters
 Miramax was celebrated and Van Sant was hired to direct the film

 An ideal human eye can see light in the air from 380 nanometers to 750 nanometers wavelength
 
 Accordingly, in water and in other mediums, it decreases visibility in multiples of the coefficient of refraction of that medium

 at: iskaa kathanak bahut kuch 'bhattikavy' ke jaisaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Its narrative from the cantagram is as follows: shesh sargo main ayodhya aagaman tathaa rajyabhishek varnit rahaa hoga
 It is known from the interpretation of the last verses that the name of the author of this epic was 'kumaradas', also known as Kumarabhatta or Kumar
 ye sinhaladweep ke raja the
 His father's name was Kumaramani
 kumaardaas kii khyaati bharatvarsh main paryaapt thi
 Jalahan has quoted several verses of 'janakiharan' in his Suktimuktavali

 The poet has remembered those poems with great gratitude at the end of this poem
 ye kumaardaas sinhaladweep ke itihaasangranth mahavansh main varnit maudgalyayan ke putr kumaar dhatusen se bhinn the
 Legend has it that Mahakavi Kalidas, an admirer of his poetry 'janakiharan', was called Saprem Sinhaldwip by Kumardas
 vahaan jaakar kalidas durbhagyavash ek sundari ke premjaal main fasakar maar daale gaye
 King Kumaradas, disgusted by this heinous murder of his guest and friend, also burnt himself on the same pyre
 aaj bhi lanka ke dakshin praant main kalidas kaa samadhisthan vidyaman he
 From Rajashekhar's foregoing statement, it leads to the conclusion that Kumaradas must have been after Kalidasa
 unki rachana par raghuvansh or kumarasambhav kaa atyadhik prabhaav bhi dikhaai padataa he
 In spite of the excessive urge towards Yamak, the rituals and prasad qualities of this poem have their own specialties

 The colonization of Mars by humans is a focal point of speculation and serious study, because its superficial conditions and the availability of water arguably make Mars the most hospitable planet in the Solar System other than Earth
 The Moon has been proposed as the first location for human colonization, but Mars has a thin atmosphere, which gives it the ability to host human and other biological life
 As potential colonization sites, with both Mars and the Moon descending into deep gravitational wells, there is also a cost and risk disadvantage, which may make asteroids another option for human early expansion into the Solar System

 Unlawful or Unreasonable - Some officials add a criterion of the definition of terrorism to a "legitimate" government-authorized distinction between demeanor or impersonal action to make it legitimate and other actors, including those individuals and small groups
 The criterion, that terrorism otherwise The use of functions would not be justified as terrorism would not be considered if they were government approved
 If it were a "legitimate" government authorized by example For Rann, a city that is designed to influence civilian support for a reason, firebombing terrorism will not be considered
 This criterion is inherently and problematic because it is not universally accepted: this state Deny the existence of terrorism, whether it can perform the same task or as terrorism, based on whether its sponsorship is known to a "legitimate" government Security can not be; "validity" is kasuti saarvbhaumik sweekaar kiye jate hai nahin he in kaarnon ke liye

 us samay lataji kaa kahana tha ki gane gane ke baad bhi un gaanon se hone vaali aamadani kaa ek ansh gayakon tathaa gayikaon ko milanaa chahie
 Rafi saheb was against this and said that once the songs have been recorded and the singer-singers have been paid their fees, they should not expect any more money

 unhone ek saath mil kar kauravon par akraman kar dene kii yojana banaai kintu yudhisthir ne unhen samajhaayaa, “he nareshon! kauravon ne teraa varsh pashchaat hamen apana rajya lautaa dene kaa vachan diya he, atev aap logon kaa kauravon par is prakaar akraman karnaa kadaapi uchit nahin he
 On hearing the words of Yudhishthira, he gave up the idea of attacking the Kauravas, but Shri Krishna vowed that he would continue to destroy the Kauravas through Bhimsen and Arjuna
 un sabake prasthaan ke ke baad unase milane ke liye vedavyas aaye
 The Pandavas gave him due respect and high governance, Ved Vyas ji taught him the technique called prati-smriti for the relief of the Pandavas
 ek din markendeya rishi bhi pandavon ke yahan padhaare or unke dwaara kiye gayi aadar-satkar se prasann hokar unhen apana rajya waapas paane kaa aashirwad diya
 In this way the Pandavas' self-confidence increased with the blessings and blessings of sages and sages

 Panchali was not able to forget her insults done in a full meeting even for a moment and used to pour the butter in Bhima and Arjuna's anger
 ek baar veeravar arjuna uttarakhand ke parvaton ko paar karte huye ek apurv sundar van main ja pahunche
 In the peaceful environment there, he started doing penance of Lord Shankar
 unki tapasya kii pariksha lene ke liye bhagwaan shankar ek bhil kaa vesh dhaaran kar us van main aaye
 On coming there, Shiva Ji in the form of Bhil saw that Tapasyarat, taking the form of a monster sucker, was in the ambush of Arjuna
 shiv ji ne us daitya par apana baan chhod diya
 At the time when Lord Shankar left the arrow after seeing the monster, at the same time Arjuna's austerity was broken and his eyes were on the monster
 unhone bhi apana gandiv dhanush uthaa kar us par baan chhod diya
 The two arrows hit the snout together and his life went out
 shookar ke mar jane par bhilrupi shiv ji or arjuna donon hi shookar ko apane baan se mara hone kaa daawa karne lage
 Disputes between the two escalated and the dispute took the form of war
 arjuna nirantar bhil par gandiv se baanon kii varsha karte rahe kintu unke baan bhil ke sharir se takaraa-takaraa kar tuutate rahe or bhil shant khadey huye muskuraataa rahaa
 In the end all the arrows of his quiver were finished
 is par arjuna ne bhil par apni talwaar se akraman kar diya
 Arjuna's sword also collided with Bhil's body and broke into two pieces
 ab arjuna krodhit hokar bhil se mall yuddh karne lage
 Even in the Malla war, Arjuna fainted with Bhil's attack
 thodi der pashchaat jab arjuna kii murchha tuuti to unhone dekha ki bhil ab bhi vahiin khadey muskura rahaa he
 Seeing the power of Bhil, Arjuna was very surprised and he put a wreath on the Shiva idol to get the power to kill Bhil, but Arjun saw that the garland went to the Bhil gorge instead of falling on the Shiva idol
 isse arjuna samaj gayi ki bhagwaan shankar hi bhil kaa rup dhaaran karke vahaan upasthit huye hai
 Arjun fell at Shankar's feet

 ek din jab chitrasen arjuna ko sangeet or nrity kii shiksha de rahe the, vahaan par indra kii apsara urvashi ai or arjuna par mohit ho gai
 Urvashi said to Arjuna, "O Arjun!" Seeing you, my lust has awakened, so please please sit with me and calm my lust
 ” urvashi ke vachan sunakar arjuna bole, “he devi! hamaare purvaj ne aapse vivaah karke hamaare vansh kaa gaurav badhaayaa tha atah puru vansh kii janani hone ke naate aap hamaari mata ke tulya hai

 After saying this, Urvashi left from there
 jab indra ko is ghatana ke vishay main gyaat hua to ve arjuna se bole, “vatsa! tumne jo vyavhaar kiya he, vah tumhaare yogya hi tha
 This curse of Urvashi was also the wish of God, this curse will work during your unknown life
 apane ek varsh ke agyatavaas ke samay hi tum punsatvaheen rahoge or agyatavaas purna hone par tumhen punah punsatv kii prapti ho jaayegi
 " udhar jab arjuna devraj kii puri amravati main rah rahe the to ek din indra ne unase kaha, “he parth! yahan rahakar tum samast astr-shastradi vidyaon main paarangat ho chuke ho or tumhaare jaisaa dhanurdhar is jagat main kadaachit hi koi doosraa hoga
 Now, fight and kill my enemy Nivatakavach
 yahi tumhaare liye gurudakshina hogi
 "after saying this, Indra sent Arjuna to battle with Nivatakavacha, wearing unfathomable armor and seated him in his divine chariot
 us rath main baithkar arjuna nivatakavach kii nagari main pahunche jo ki samudr main basaa tha
 Seeing that she was more captivating than the city of Indra's Puri Amravati, Arjun was surprised
 unke aashcharya kaa nivaaran karne ke liye indra ke sarathi matli bole, “he arjuna! pehle devraj indra samast devataaon sahit isi nagari main nivas karte the
 But Nivatakavacha became very strong after getting the groom from Brahma ji and conquered Indra and as a result Devaraja had to leave this city and go to Amravati
 ”matli kii baat sunakar arjuna ne apane shankh kii dhwani se us nagari ko gunja diya
 Hearing the sound of the conch, Nivatakavach came equipped with his weapons and went to fight with Arjuna
 donon mahaarathiyon main ghor yuddh hone laga or ant main arjuna ke haathon nivatakavach maaraa gaya
 On returning after killing Nivatakvach, Devraj Indra praised his valor and said, “O Partha! Now your work here is over
 aapke bhai gandhamadan parvat par aapaki pratiksha kar rahe hai
 Let me bring you to them now
 ”is prakaar arjuna devraj indra ke saath unke rath main baithkar gandhamadan parvat main apane bhaaiyon ke paas aa pahunche
