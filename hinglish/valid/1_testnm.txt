 This article deals with both definitions

 The main objective of human resource management is to ensure maximum benefit from the investment made on the employees of the company and to reduce the financial risk

 Human resource management performs the following important tasks: aadhunik vishleshan is baat par jor detaa he ki manushya "vastu athwa "sansaadhan" nahin hai, balki ek utpaadan sanstha main rachanaatmak or saamaajik praani hai

 The International Labor Organization also decided to revisit 2001 and revise Section 150 on Human Resource Development in 1975
 One approach to these trends is to build a strong social consensus on political economy and a good social welfare system, mobility of workers Facilitates and makes the whole economy more fruitful because it helps labor skills and experience Can develop in various forms and they face less difficulty or difficulty in moving from one unit to another or adapting themselves to the environment
 ek or nazariyaa he ki sarkaron ko sabhi kshetron main maanav sansaadhan vikaas ko suvidhajanak banane main apni rashtriya bhoomika ke prati adhik jaagruk hona chahie
 An important controversy about labor mobility refers to a broader philosophical issue involving the phrase "human resources": governments in developing countries often accuse developed countries of promoting immigration of "guest workers" who are actually developing countries
 And are necessary for the development of their civilization
 unka tark he ki yah samaayojan aupniveshik vastu phiet ke samaan he jis main upniveshvaadi europea shaktiyaan prakritik sansadhano ke liye ek manamaana mulya tay karti hai, jo us raashtra ke prakritik sroton se praapt kiye gaye hote hai
 Thus in many ways the debate of "human resources versus human capital" is similar to natural resources versus natural sources
 samay ke saath sanyukt raashtra ne aam taur par vikasshil deshon ke drushtikon kaa samarthan kiya he or unhonen paryaapt "videshi sahaayta" kaa anurodh kiya he taaki vikasshil desh maanav poonji kii kami ke chalate prashikshan, vyaper tathaa kala main nae logon ko prashikshan dene kii kshamta na kho den
 An extreme aspect of this view is that current developed countries, which have benefited from the theft of "human resources" during their development, should be compensated for historical injustices such as African slavery
 yah ek bahut hi vivaadaaspad pahalu he, lekin yah maanav sansaadhan ko maanav puunji main badalane ke saamaanya vishay kii vyakhya karata he or is prakaar mejabaan samaaj main iskaa mulya kam hota ja rahaa he, jaise ki - "africa ", jiske logon ko samaaj dwaara kritrim tangi dikhaa "shramikon" ke rup main inkaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 According to reports given to the General Assembly of the Secretary General of the United Nations, a broad inter-sectoral approach to the development of human resources is changing the approach to human resource development

 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua
 Among the ancient Christians, this was in the form of a great zeal for the construction of churches that expressed the true simplicity and pride of Jesus Christ; Amongst Gothic makers, this structure was an ardent force with knowledge of mechanics; In the Italian revival it was the scholar of that era
 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose to the styles, such as the changing fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 The Milau Viaduct bridge, built on the Tarn river valley in southern France, was designed to connect Paris to Barcelona
 The height of one pillar is up to 343
 The bridge is slightly higher than the Eiffel Tower in France and is only 38 meters shorter than the Empire State Building in New York
 The cable-laden bridge is counted among the most unique road bridges in the world
 Construction of the bridge, designed by French structural engineer Michael Virlojux and British architect Norman Forster, began in 2001, which took almost three years to complete
 It cost around Euro 400 million to make it
 It was formally inaugurated on 14 December 2004, after which it was opened to traffic two days later
 Translucent glass has also been installed on this high-rise bridge, which protects the vehicles passing through it from the strong flow of air

 For proper study of the organism, it is necessary that organisms with different properties and characteristics are placed in different categories
 is tarah se jantuon evam padpon ke vargeekaran ko vargiki yaa vargeekaran vigyaan angreji main vargiki ke liye do shabd prayog main laaye jate hai - texonomi tathaa systematics 
 Karl Linnaeus wrote the book Sistema Naturai based on the word Systematics in 1735 AD
 aadhunik yug main ye donon shabd padap or jantu vargeekaran ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Classics work is based on morphology, morphology, ecology and genetics
 anya vaigyanik anushasano kii tarah yah bhi anek prakaar ke gyaan, mat or pranaaliyon kaa sashleshan he, jiskaa prayog vargeekaran ke kshetra main hota he
 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 vargiki kaa mul nirmaan aakaaraki yaa akritivigyaan, kriyavigyaan, paristhitiki or anuvanshiki par aadhaarit he
 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also a synthesis of many types of knowledge, opinions and systems, which are used in the field of classification
 jeevigyaan sambandhi kisi prakaar ke vishleshan kaa pratham sopan he suvyavasthit dhang se uskaa vargeekaran; at: padap, yaa jantu ke adhyayan kaa pehla kadam he uskaa namakaran, vargeekaran or tab varnan
 Nowadays more than four lakh species of plants are known
 ye linius ke samay se sathguni adhik hai
 About 4,750 new castes are described every year
 samanarthak or upjatiyon ko milakar keval fenrogams or kriptogams naamak padap samoohon main 1763 se 1942 i
 tak das lakh se bhi adhik naam die ja chuke hai
 The species of animals described are more than the plant species in the count
 upjatiyon ko milakar 20 lakh se adhik jantujatiyon ke naam gyaat hai or prati varsh lagbhag 10,000 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 The history of taxonomy is as old as human history
 samaj boojh hote hi manushya ne aas paas ke jantuon or paudhon ko pahchaanana tathaa unako naam dena prarambh kiya
 Many ancient scholars of Greece, notably Hippocrates and Democritus, have ranked animals in their studies
 spasht rup se arestu ne apane samay ke gyaan kaa upyukt sankalan kiya he
 The beginning of classification appears in the mention of Aristotle
 inkaa mat he ki jantu apane rahan sahan ke dhang, swabhaav or shaareerik aakaar ke aadhaar par pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 He mentions animal groups such as birds, fish, whale, insects, and has also used the words Coleoptera and Diptera for small groups
 is samay ke vanaspativid arestu kii vichaardhaara se aage the
 He had a successful classification of local plants
 branfels or bauhin padap vargeekaran ko safal raste par laanevaale vaigyanik the, parantu jantuon kaa vargeekaran karanevaale is samay ke visheshgy ab bhi arestu kii vichaardhaara ke antargat kaary kar rahe the
 John Ray was the first person in the field of genealogical experts to distinguish between caste and lineage, and was the first among ancient scientists to have a higher natural classification
 inkaa prabhaav sweden ke rahanevaale mahaan prakrutivaadee karl liniyas par padaa
 Linnaeus did unique work in this direction
 isliye inhen vargeekaran vigyaan kaa janmdata mana jaataa he
 In the eighteenth century, the ideas of evolutionism had an impact on taxonomy
 unnisvin shatabdi ke madhya main yah prabhaav apane shikhar par pahunch gaya
 At the same time, classification experts became very interested in animals from distant places
 ve dur deshon ke jaanwaron ke vishay main jaankaree karnaa chaahate the or parichit jaanwaron se unka sambandh karnaa chaahate the
 Hence, there were long voyages at this time
 dur dur ke jaanwaron kaa adhyayan kiya gaya or unke vansh tathaa kutumb aadi kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 One such voyage took place on a ship called Bigley which also included a naturalist named Charles Darwin
 is kaal main vargeekaran vigyaan main badi pragati kii gai or vargeekaran main anek nai jatiyaan, vansh or kutumb jode gaye
 Classification made in the twentieth century is characteristic of science
 haxli ke vicharanusaar aadhunik vargeekaran vigyaan bhugol, paristhitiki, koshiki or anuvanshiki aadi kaa sanshleshan he
 In earlier times, the basis of classification science was "types", which were presented with the help of natural traits
 aadhunik vargeekaran vigyaan main jatiyon kaa varnan purnataya akritik lakshanon par aadhaarit nahin he, jaivik he, jisaki vajah se bhugolic, paristhitik, jananeey tathaa kuch anya lakshanon par bhi dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Formal concept broadens the stability of ranges, increases the differences between each other and reduces variability
 iske vipareet he jansankhya sankalpana, jiske anusaar spishiz parivartansheel jansankhya se bani he or sthir nahin he
 Defining specific groups or categories by reverse means a definite method of classification
 linius ne aisi paanch shreniyan banaai thim : Each category consists of one or more lower level groups and they form the lower category
 isi tarah prayek kramik shrenee ek athwa ek se adhik unchi shrenee se sambandhit hoti he
 These ranges form a comprehensive system by decreasing natural discernment
 gyaan ke vikaas ke saath saath in shreniyon kii sankhya badhati gai
 Between the world and the class, between the union and the gana and the dynasty, categories called kutumb were added
 linius ke vicharanusaar prajati ek vaikalpik shrenee he, jiske antargat bhugolic athwa vyaktigat vibhinnata aati he
 In this way, the following seven categories are now: vargeekaran kii or adhik parishuddh vyakhya ke liye in shreniyon ko bhi vibhajit kar anya shreniyan banaai gai hai
 Mostly these categories are named by adding prefixes or sub prefixes before the original name
 udaahranarth, adhigan or upagan aadi
 Many names were proposed for higher categories, but they are not in common use
 keval aadim jati kaa kutumb or vansh ke bich prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some authors, such as Simpson, have used the name cohort between gana and class
 is tarah saadhaaran taur se kaam laai janevaali shreniyon kii sankhya is samay nimnlikhit he : At present, the 'international Nomenclature Code' defines seven categories of classification of organisms
 ye shreniyan hai- jagat, sangh, varg, gana, kul, vansh tathaa jati 
 haal ke varshon main domen naamak ek or str prachlan main aayaa he jo 'jagat' ke rakhaa upar he
 However, it has not yet been approved in the codes

 charvak darshan ek bhautikwaadi naastik darshan he
 It accepts only direct evidence and does not accept this doctrine from the hereafter
 yah darshan vedabaahya bhi kaha jaataa he
 The Vedabya philosophies are six - Charvaka, Madhyamika, Yogachara, Sautrantika, Vaibhashika, and Arhat
 in sabhi main veda se asammat siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 Ajit Keshakambali is credited as the precursor of Charvaka, while Jupiter is commonly referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokayat philosophy
 charvak, brihaspati sutara ke adhikansh praathmik sahitya gaayab yaa kho gaye hai
 Its teachings have been compiled from historical secondary literature such as the scriptures, sutras, and in Indian epic poetry and from the dialogues and Jain literature of Gautama Buddha
 charvak pracheen bharat ke ek anishvaravaadi or naastik taarkik the
 They are believed to be the disciples of Jupiter, the originator of the atheist
 brihaspati or charvak kab hue iskaa kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 Jupiter is considered by Chanakya in his Arthashastra book to be one of the principal teachers of economics
 charvak kaa naam sunate hi aapako ‘yada jivet sukhan jivet, rin kruthva, ghrutan pivet’ kii yaad aegi
 ‘charvak’ naam ko hi ghrinaaspad gaali kii tarah badal diya gaya he
 It was as if the borrowers, the philanthropists and the fallen people were the only ones who followed this theory
 prachlit dharna yahi he ki charvak shabd kii utpati ‘chaaru’+’vaak’ se hui he
 It is evident that this nomenclature has been made by those opponents of this theory who believed that these people seduced innocent people with sweet things
 charvak siddhanton ke liye buddha pitakon tak main ‘lokayat’ shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jiskaa matlab ‘darshan kii vah pranali he jo jo is lok main vishwaas karti he or swarg, narak athwa mukti kii avadharana main vishwaas nahin rakhti’
 charvak yaa lokayat darshan kaa zikr to mahabharat main bhi miltaa he lekin iskaa koi bhi mul granth uplabdh nahin
 Apparently, as it spoke against the ruling forces of its time, its texts were destroyed and in the popular narrative, the Charvakas were introduced as villains
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak kaa mat diya hua miltaa he
 It is written in Padmapurana that Jupiter had expressed Vedaviruddha opinion to seduce Asuras
 naastik mat ke sambadh main vishnupurana main likhaa he ki jab dharmabal se daitya bahut prabal hue tab devataaon ne vishnu ke yahan pukaar kii
 Vishnu produced a man named Mayamoh from his body who went on the banks of the Narmada in the form of Digambar and seduced the Asuras and corrupted them in the Dharmargava
 mayamoh ne asuron ko jo upadesh kiya vah sarvadarshansangrah main die hue charvak mat ke shlokon se bilkul miltaa he
 Like, - Mayamoh has said that if the animal killed in the yagna goes to heaven then why does not Yajaman kill his father, etc
 lingapurana main tripuravinaash ke prasang main bhi shivaprerit ek digambar muni dwaara asuron ke isi prakaar bahakaae jane kii katha likhi he jiskaa lakshya jainon par jaan padataa he
 In the Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya scandal, Maharishi Javali's preaching to Ramachandra to leave Banabas and return to Ayodhya is also found in the opinion of Charvak
 in sab baton se siddh hota he ki naastik mat bahut pracheen he
 It should be understood at the same time that the excess of Vedic rituals had started knocking some people
 charvak ishwar or paralok nahin maanate
 His philosophy is also called Lokayat because of not obeying the hereafter
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak ke mat se sukh hi is jivan kaa pradhan lakshya he
 There is also sorrow in the world, realizing that those who do not want to enjoy happiness are fools
 machhlee main kaante hote hai to kya isse koi machhlee hi na khaay ? choupaae khet par jaayange, is dar se kya koi khet hi na bove ? ityadi
 Charvaks do not consider the soul as a separate substance
 unke mat se jis prakaar gud, tandul aadi ke sanyog se madh main maadakta utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu in chaar bhuton ke sanyogvishesh se chetanta utpann ho jaati he
 By their analysis or destruction, 'I' means consciousness is also destroyed
 is chetan sharir ke naam ke peeche phir punaragaman aadi nahin hota
 God, otherworldly subjects etc
 are based on conjecture
 par charvak pratyaksh ko chhodkar anumaan ko pramaan main nahin lete
 He argues that inference is dependent on prevalence
 jo gyaan hamen baahar indriyon ke dwaara hota he use bhoot or bhavishya tak badhaakar le jane kaa naam vyaptigyaan he, jo asambhav he
 This knowledge is visible in the mind, it is not a proof because the mind is dependent on the senses for its experience
 yadi kaho ki anumaan ke dwaara vyaptigyaan hota he to itaretarashray dosha aata he, kyonki vyaptigyaan ko lekar hi to anumaan ko siddh kiya chaahate ho
 The idea of charvak should be seen in Sarvadarsanasangraha, sarvadarshanasiromani and jupitersutra
 naishadh ke 17wein sarg main bhi is mat kaa vistrut ullekh he
 Charvak only supports pragmatism, he does not follow the presumptions etc
 uske mat se prithvi jal tej or vaayu ye chaar hi tatv he, jinase sab kuch bana he
 In his opinion, the sky is not the position of the element, it is a body formed by the combination of these four elements, only a special type of combination of them creates consciousness in the body, which people call a soul
 sharir jab vinasht ho jaataa he, to chaitanya bhi khatm ho jaataa he
 In this way, the organism originates from these ghosts and ends as soon as these ghosts are destroyed, it has no importance back and forth
 isaliye jo chetan main deh dikhaai detii he vahi aatma kaa rup he, deh se atirikt aatma hone kaa koi pramaan hi nahin miltaa he
 By the opinion of Charvak, women are called sons and their relatives and the happiness given by them is called happiness
 unka aalingan karnaa hi purusharth he, sansar main khaanaa pinaa or sukh se rahanaa chaiye
 It has been said in this philosophy that: - arth he ki jab tak jeena chaiye sukh se jeena chaiye, agar apane paas saadhan nahin he, to duusare se udhaar lekar mouj karnaa chaiye, shamshaan main sharir ke jalane ke baad sharir ko kisne waapas aate dekha he? According to Charvaka philosophy, these four elements earth, water, light and air are the root causes of creation
 jis prakaar buddha usee prakaar charvak kaa bhi mat he ki akaash naamak koi tatva nahin he
 This is just zero
 apni aanvik avasthaa se sthool avasthaa main aane par uparyukt chaar tatva hi bahya jagat, indriya athwa deh ke rup main drusht hote hai
 Their proof system is the reason behind not obeying the objective power of the sky
 jis prakaar ham gandh, ras, rup or sparsh kaa pratyaksh anubhav karte hue unke samavayiyon kaa bhi tattat indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh karte hai
 The sky element is not the same
 at: unke mat main akaash naamak tatva he hi nahin
 What is the reason for the four elements? Charvakas do not have the answer to this question
 yah vishwa akasmaat bhinn-bhinn roopon evam bhinn-bhinn matraaon main milane vaale chaar mahabhuton kaa sangrah yaa sanghatt maatr he
 According to the Charvakas, there is no other substance called the Atma from the four mahabhutas
 chaitanya aatma kaa gun he
 Since there is no such thing as a soul, therefore the virtue or religion of the conscious body is proved
 arthath yah sharir hi aatma he
 There are three types of its accomplishment - logic, experience and Ayurveda scripture
 tark se aatma kii siddhi ke liye charvak log kehete hai ki sharir ke rahane par chaitanya rahata he or sharir ke na rahane par chaitanya nahin rahata
 With this unknown contrast, the body itself proves to be the basis of consciousness
 anubhav 'main sthool hoon', 'main durbal hoon', 'main gora hoon', 'main niskriy hoon' ityadi anubhav hamen pag-pag par hota he
 Physical weakness etc
 are the religions of the body and 'I' is also the same
 at: sharir hi aatma he
 In Ayurveda, mixing of good, barley, mahua, etc
 in order of chronological order makes the mixture strong, or a mixture of curd, yellow clay and cow dung produces a scorpion or in betel leaf, catechu, betel nut and lime
 Redness in the mouth is produced by mixing them even if there is no red color, in the same way Chaitanya is produced by the specific combination of quadrilaterals
 kintu in bhuton ke vishisht maatra main mishran kaa kaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvak ke paas swabhaavvaad ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 In the scriptures of God, justice etc
, God is proved by the presumption or objection
 chunki charvak pratyaksh or keval pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he at: uske mat main pratyaksh drishyman raja hi ishwar hai vah apane rajya kaa tathaa usamen rahane vaali praja kaa niyanta hota he
 Therefore, he should be considered as God
 prameya arthath vishay kaa yatharth gyaan arthath prama ke liye pramaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Charvac folk consider only direct evidence
 vishay tathaa indriya ke sannikarsh se utpann gyaan pratyaksh gyaan kehalaata he
 The world theorem is directly visible through our senses
 iske atirikt anya padaarth asat he
 Through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, the word Gandh Rasa and touch are directly visible to all of us
 jo vastu anubhavgamya nahin hoti uske liye kisi anya pramaan kii aavashyaktaa bhi nahin hoti
 Buddhists, Jainism, non-vedic philosophy and nyaya-vedic, etc
 also consider semi-vedic philosophy inference as proof
 unka kahana he ki samast prameya padaarthon kii satta keval pratyaksh pramaan se siddh nahin kii ja sakati
 But Charvak states that only possibility can be created by inference
 nishchayatmak gyaan pratyaksh se hi hota hai
 Seeing the remote green lush trees, listening to the cacophony of the birds there, we consider the possibility of water there due to the cool breeze from there
 jal kii uplabdhi vahaan jaakar pratyaksh dekhne se hi nishchit hoti he
 Therefore, to generate possibility and to conduct public behavior, inference is necessary but it cannot be proof
 jis vyapti ke aadhaar par anumaan pramaan kii satta maani jaati he vah vyapti ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 It is the nature of fire with dhoom and the smell of smell with flowers
 sukh or dharm kaa du:kha or adharm kaa kaaryakaaran bhav swaabhaavik he
 Just like the sweetness in the word of Kokil and the consternation in the word of crows, it should be understood everywhere
 jahaan tak shabd pramaan kii baat he to vah to ek prakaar se pratyaksh pramaan hi he
 The words of the aggrieved person are directly told to us
 unako sunne se arth gyaan hota he
 This is obvious
 jahaan tak vedon kaa prashn he unke vaakya adrusht or ashrutapurna vishyon kaa varnan karte hai at: unki vishwasaneeyata sandigdh he
 At the same time, Vedas prove their inhumanity by doing disgusting things like Ashwaglagrahna in unrighteousness etc
 and committing abusive acts like eating meat and using meaningless words like Jarbhari Turfari
 uparyukt vivaran se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki charvak log is pratyaksh drishyman deh or jagat ke atirikt kisi anya padaarth ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Those people who consider Purusharthchatashta, called religion, meaning, work and salvation, are considered useful for men, ie human body
 unki drushti main arth or kaam hi param purusharth he
 It is foolish to believe in an object called religion because when there is no other heaven etc
 apart from this world, it is unrestrained to enjoy the fruit of religion in heaven
 pakhand dhurtton ke dwaara kapolkalpit swarg kaa sukh bhogane ke liye yahan yajna aadi karnaa dharm nahin he balki usamen kii jane vaali pashu hinsa aadi ke kaaran vah adharm hi he tathaa havan aadi karnaa tattd vastuon kaa durupyog tathaa vyarth sharir ko ksht dena he isaliye jo kaary sharir ko sukh pahunchaaye usee ko karnaa chaiye
 In which there is satisfaction of the senses, the mind should rejoice
 jinase indriyon kii tripti ho man anandit ho unheen vishyon kaa seven karnaa chaiye
 Religion is not to remove, not kill, kill those elements which are obstructing the senses of the body
 shaareerik maansik ksht sahanaa, vishayanand se man or sharir ko balaat virat karnaa adharm he
 This means that the believer in Vedic and even semi-vedic philosophies, following the ethos described in the Puranas, if the body is a seeker of happiness, they should follow it and if they are obstructed by it, they should be discarded forever
 charvaakon kii moksh kii kalpana bhi unke tatva mimasaa evam gyaan mimasaa ke prabhaav se purna prabhavit he
 As long as there is a body, a man suffers from various kinds of suffering
 yahi narak he
 Freedom from this suffering group is attained when the body becomes conscious, that is, it dies
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body does not experience any suffering
 yadhyapi anya darshanon main aatma ke astitv ko sweekaar karte hue usee ke mukt hone kii charchaa kii gayi he or moksh kaa swaroop bhinn-bhinn darshanon main bhinn-bhinn he, tathaapi charvak unki manyata ko prashray nahin dete
 He neither considers salvation as eternal, neither considers it to be true and chit form, nor does he accept salvation as his position in Sachchidanand form
 charvak darshan vah darshan he jo jan saamaanya main swabhaavat: priy he
 The philosophy whose sentences are charu means interesting is the Charvak philosophy
 sabhi shastreey gambheer vishyon kaa vyaavhaarik evam loukik purv paksh hi charvak darshan he
 Everything we do in the natural form is the basis of the Charvak philosophy
 charvak darshan jivan ke har paksh ko sahaj drushti se dekhtaa he
 This simple vision towards life is Charvak philosophy
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki, vishwa kaa har maanav jo jivan jeeta he vah charvak darshan hi he
 Such sentences and principles which will be pleasing to everyone, will be a rectangle or special in the world
 sambhavat: yahi kaaran he ki ham charvak darshan ko lokayat darshan ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 This philosophy is also famous among scholars known as Barhaspatya philosophy
 is naam se yah prathit hota he ki yah darshan brihaspati ke dwaara virachit he
 Brihaspati is recognized as the guru of the gods in Indian society
 parantu bhartiya sahitya main brihaspati ek nahin hai
 It is a very difficult task to decide who is the originator of Charvak philosophy, Jupiter
 anigaras evam loukya rup main do brihaspatiyon kaa samullekh rugveda main praapt hota he
 According to Ashwaghosha, Arghus is the prophet of Jupiter's philosophy
 loukya brihaspati ke mat main sat padaarth kii utpatti asat se maani jaati he
 Similarly, the origin of discrete matter has been assumed from the truth
 jad padaarthon ko hi asat kaha jaataa he
 Conscious substances are called Satas according to this belief
 ek brihaspati kaa nirdesh mahabharat ke van parv main bhi praapt hota he
 This Jupiter takes the form of Venus, to conserve Indra and to destroy the demons, to create anatomism or prapancha science
 is prapanch vigyaan ke falswaroop shubh ko ashubh evam ashubh ko shubh maanate hue daanav veda evam shastron kii aalochana evam ninda main sanlagn ho jate hai
 In another context, there is a description of another Jupiter in the Mahabharata itself, who, together with Shukracharya, composed the discourse
 vibhinn shastron ke aacharyon kii maane to charvak mat darshan kii shrenee main nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki is darshan main maatr madhur vachanon kii aad main vanchanaa kaa hi kaary kiya gaya he
 It is another matter that if he listens to Charvak, he also declares various scholars to be deceptive
 ek aise brihaspati kaa taittareey brahman granth main varnan miltaa he jo gayatri devi ke mastak par aghat karata he gayatri devi ko padam puraana ke anusaar samast vedon kaa mul mana gaya he
 From this point of view it can be considered as the antagonist of Jupiter Veda
 sambhavat: veda kaa virodh prati pad karne ke kaaran is brihaspati ko charvak darshan kaa praneta bhi mana janaa yuktiyukt hoga
 The theme of Jupiter is also found in Vishnu Purana
 brihaspati kii is manyata ke anusaar vaidic karmkand bahuvitt ke vyay evam prayaas se saadhy he
 These Vedic remedies for the seekers of diverse pleasures are the law of some self-centered selfishness
 taarkik brihaspati kaa bhi kahin kahin varnan miltaa he
 They are the followers of the Jupiter Veda, but only support rational rituals
 inaki drushti se tatva nirnay shaastra par aadhaarit avashya hona chahie parantu yah shastreey anusandhan tark poshit hona nitant aavashyak he
 Argumentless thinking can never be meaningful in determining religion
 vatsyayan muni ne apane vishwa prasiddh granth kamasutra main arthshaastra ke rachayita ke rup main brihaspati kaa ullekh kiya he
 According to a formula of economics written by Jupiter, only Lokayata has been recognized as a scripture
 falat: arthshaastra ke praneta brihaspati evam lokayat shaastra ke pravarttak main antar kar paanaa atyant duruh kaary he
 Some critics have considered Jupiter to be the creator of Kamasutra as well as the creator of economics and the creator of Lokayata Shastra
 yadi loukik ichchhaaon ko purna karnaa hi charvak darshan kaa uddeshy he to kaamshaastra ke pravarttak muni vatsyayan hi brihaspati hai, yah maananaa upyukt hi he
 Kautilya has given a comfortable rendering of Lokayat philosophy in economics
 is prakaar arthshaastra ke rachanaakaar kautilya evam lokayat darshan ke praneta brihaspati ek hi hai aisa mana ja saktaa he
 According to the treasurer Hemachandra, the author of Economics, Kamasutra, nyasutra-bhasya, Panchatantra and Chanakya Policy is the same
 itani vivechna ke baad jo brihaspati vaidic vaaiumay main vibhinn prasangon main charchit hai unke yatha kram naam is prakaar spasht hote hai
 In the context of Padma Purana, Angira is the psyche son of Brahma
 angiras brihaspati angira ke putr evam brahma ke pautra hai
 As a result, they are counted among the gods
 is prakaar dev guru brihaspati evam angiras brihaspati main koi bhed nahin mana ja saktaa
 For the preservation of the gods, the preaching of the devas to the asuras by the Guru of the gods has been implied in various worlds, this statement cannot be reliable in the context of Dev Guru Brihaspati
 asur apane guru shukracharya ke rahete devguru ke upadesh ko kyon aadar denge? at: devguru se atirikt koi charvak darshan kaa pravarttak hona apekshit he
 Some critics have categorically acknowledged that Jupiter, the master of Charvaka, the master of heaven Indra, the master of heaven, is not a world-renowned Jupiter
 ye brihaspati kisi rajkul ke guru hai
 From the historical point of view, if Vashistha, Vishwamitra, Dronacharya, etc
, being the master of any Rajkula, is also giving the basis for this belief
 jis prakaar aastik darshanon main shankar darshan shiromani ke rup main sweekrut he usee prakaar naastik darshanon main sabase utkrisht naastik ke rup main shiromani kii tarah charvak darshan kii pratishtha nirvivaad he
 Atheist Shiromani Charwak is also believed to have rejected the supernatural sovereign power of God recognized in one form or another on the basis of faith in the world
 inke matanusaar ishwar naam kii koi vastu sansar main nahin he
 The atheist Shiromani Charwak, who is visible from some external senses, feels the same, accepts his power
 yahi kaaran he ki charvak ke siddhanth main pratyaksh pramaan ko chhod kar koi doosraa pramaan nahin mana gaya he
 The power of the God who has been conceived in other philosophies is not possible through direct evidence
 inke mat se beej se jo ankur kaa pradurbhaav hota he usamen ishwar kii bhoomika ko maananaa anaavashyak evam uphasaaspad hi he
 The origin of sprout is proven to be a natural and natural process of survival by the combination of soil and water
 is swabhaavik kaary ko sampann karne ke liye kisi adrusht kartta kii sweekruti nirarthak he
 If you do not believe in God, how will it be possible to arrange the results of good and inauspicious deeds of living beings? Solving this question, Charvak asks, which system of karma fruit is required? Two types of karma are seen in the world
 ek loukik tathaa doosraa alokik karm
 Are you concerned about the arrangement of the fruits of cosmic actions? If yes, then this concern is unnecessary
 loukik karmon kaa fal vidhaan to lok main sarv maanya raja yaa prashaasak hi karata he
 This proven fact is obvious
 ham dekhte hai ki chaurya karm aadi nishiddh kaary karne vaale ko uske dushkarm kaa samuchit fal, lok siddh raja hi dand ke rup main karagaar aadi main bhej kar detaa he
 In the same way, a person who performs auspicious actions like protecting one's life, etc
, in the form of a reward, the king confirms it with a good means of wealth and honor
 yadi aap alokik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sandarbh main sachint hai to yah chintaa bhi nahin kerani chahie
 Because all these Yajna, Puja, recitation, penance etc
 prescribed in terms of parlokik fruits have been conceived by some rogues with a view to cheating the common man and to maintain their livelihood and stomach
 vastav main agnihotra, teen veda, tridand kaa dhaaran tathaa sharir main jagah jagah bhasma kaa sanlep buddhi evam purusharth hinata ke hi parichaayak hai
 No one has lost sight of these Vedic deeds till date
 yadi vaidic karmon kaa koi fal hota to avashya kisi na kisi ko iskaa pratyaksh aaj tak hua hota
 Therefore, till date no one has the direct experience of these Vedic or Varnashrama-system-related deeds - heaven, salvation, devaloka gaan etc
, so all these Vedic deeds are unfruitful, it is proved to be automatic
 yahan yadi aastik darshan yah kahe ki paralok swarg aadi ko siddh karne vaala vyapaar adrusht yaa dharm evam adharm he jisase swarg kii siddhi hoti he to yah charvak ko sweekaarya nahin he
 Rejecting the supernatural, the Charvak abrogates the role of the unseen in the means of heaven and heaven and thus destroys the core of the believer's philosophy
 yahi kaaran he ki adrusht ke aadhaar par siddh hone vaale swarg aadi paralok ke nirasan ke saath hi is adrusht ke niamak yaa vyavasthaapak ke rup main ishwar kaa bhi niraas charvak mat main anayas hi ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, no living being is different from the body
 sharir hi jeev yaa aatma he
 As a result, when the destruction of the body takes place after the cremation after death, then the creature or soul also perishes
 sharir main jo chaar yaa paanch mahabhuton kaa samavdhaan he, yah samavdhaan hi chaitanya kaa kaaran he
 This belief that this creature goes beyond death after death, it is proved unfounded by accepting the body as conscious or soul
 shastron main paribhaashit moksh rup param purusharth bhi charvak nahin sweekaar karata he
 Salvation of the conscious body is salvation in this opinion
 dharm evam adharm ke na hone se charvak siddhanth main dharm-adharm yaa punya-paap ko, koi adrishy swarg evam narak aadi fal bhi nahin he yah anayas hi siddh ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, how can the sensation of the sensation of the child in childhood be remembered in old age or youth when the body is considered a soul? This is a burning question that arises easily
 yahan yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki baalyavastha kaa sharir, vriddhavastha kaa sharir evam yuvavastha kaa sharir ek hi he
 If the body of the three states were the same, then there would not be such a big difference between the bodies of these three states
 antar se yah spasht siddh hota he ki sharir ke avyav jo maance pind aadi hai inamen vruddhi evam hraas hota he
 And it is only due to these degradation and growth that destruction of the body of childhood and creation of the body of youth is proved
 yadi yah kahen ki yuvavastha ke sharir main yah vahi sharir he, yah vyavhaar hone ke kaaran sharir ko ek maan kar uparyukt samaran ko utpann kiya ja saktaa he, to yah kathan bhi yuktiyukt nahin ho saktaa
 Because this is the same body, this affirmation is due to the similarity of form and shape
 falat: donon avasthaaon ke shariron ko abhinn nahin mana ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, in order to fulfill the memory of the pre-seen childhood period, the birth rites in the body of the Charvak Balakala create new rites like the ones in the body of other youth
 isi prakaar yuvavastha ke sharir main vidyaman sanskaar vriddhavastha ke sharir main apane jaise sanskaar utpann kar dete hai
 The etavata is recollected in the Charvak School without any hindrance from the address of these childhood rites
 antat: charvak darshan main sharir hi aatma he yah sahaj hi siddh hota he
 If the body itself is a soul, then Charvak can be asked that 'mama body' this is my body, how will such a popular behavior be generated? By this behavior it seems that the body is different and the master of the body is someone else, who is a separate soul from the body
 is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak kahata he ki jaise daanav vishesh ke sir ko hi raahu kaha gaya he, phir bhi jan-saamaanya 'raahu kaa sir' yah vyavhaar bade hi sahaj rup main karata he, usee prakaar sharir ke hi aatma hone par bhi 'meraa sharir' yah loksiddh vyavhaar uppann ho jaayegaa
 In the Charvakas, the objection of remembrance cannot be dispelled if the senses are destroyed by considering some of the Charvak senses as a soul
 kinhin charvaakon ne praan evam man ko bhi aatma ke rup main mana he
 To prove that the body is a soul, Charvak also presents the context of this Veda for the satisfaction of the believers
 is veda vachan kaa taatpary he ki 'vigyaan se yukt aatma in bhuton se utpann ho kar ant main in bhuton main hi villin ho jaataa he
 It is the merger of the soul with the body in the ghosts and death

 The bulk of the Confederate armies were assembled by the Quraysh of Mecca, led by Abu Sufyan, who fielded 4,000 foot soldiers, 300 cavalrymen, and 1000–1500 men on camels
 banu nadir ne najad ke namakan kii shuruyaat kii
 Nadir enlisted Banu Ghatfan by paying him half of his crop
 is aakasmik, duusari sabase badi, ne lagbhag 2,000 purushon or 300 ghudsavaaron kii takat badha di, jiske netritv main unina bin hasan fajari kii aguai hui
 Bani Assad also agreed to join the leadership of Tuleha Assadi
 banu sulaayam se, nadir ne 700 logon ko surakshit kiya, haalanki yah bal shaayad itnaa bada ho gaya tha ki iske kuch netaa islam ke prati sahanubhuti rakhte the
 Bani Amir, who made a pact with Muhammad, refused to join
 anya janajatiyon main banu mura, 400 logon ke saath hars ebn ouf muri or banu shuja ke netritv main, sufaan ebn abd shams kii aguwai main 700 logon ke saath shaamil the
 Overall, the strength of the Confederate armies, although not agreed upon by scholars, is estimated to consist of about 10,000 men and six hundred cavalry
 janvari 627 main sena, jiskaa netritv abu sufaan ne kiya tha, madina par chadhaai kar rahi thi
 As planned, the armies started moving from Medina, Mecca from the south and others from the east
 usee samay banu khuja se ghudsavaar hamalavar sena ke madina ko chetavanee dene ke liye chale gaye
 The men of Banu Khuja arrived in Muhammad in four days, warning them of the coming Union forces in a week
 mohammad ne dushman par kaabo paane kii sarvottam ranneeti par charchaa karne ke liye mediniyon ko ikattha kiya
 Both suggestions were made, meeting the enemy in the open, and waiting for them inside the city
 aakhirkaar, bade paimaane par muslimon ne uttari morche ke saath baadha ke rup main kaary karne ke liye gahare khaaiyon ko khodakar rakshaatmak ladaai main shaamil hone kaa vikalp chunaa
 The defensive trench strategy was introduced by Salman Persian
 mohammad samet madina main har sakasham musalmaan ne chah dinon main baari khai khodne main yogadan diya
 The trench was dug only on the northern side, as the rest of the medina was surrounded by rocky mountains and trees, impenetrable to large armies
 mirch main ek akaal ke saath milakar khai kii khudaai hui
 Women and children had moved to the inner city
 mediniyon ne apni sabhi fasalon ko jaldi hi kataai kii, isliye sangheey senaaon ko apane swayan ke khaadya bhandar par bharosa karnaa hoga
 Muhammad established his military headquarters in the mountainous region of Sala and the army was there; If the enemy crosses the abyss then this situation will provide benefits to the Muslims
 akraman se shahar kii raksha karne vaali antim sena main 3,000 purush shaamil the, or 14 saal kii umr main madina ke sabhi nivaasiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya, banu kuraija ko chhodkar 
 The siege of Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days
 chunki gheraabandi arab yuddh main asaamaanya thi, isliye muslimon dwaara khole gaye khaaiyon se nipatane ke liye aane vaale sanghon ko taiyaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 The Confederates tried to attack with the cavalrymen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were sternly trapped, preventing so much crossing
 donon senaayen khai ke donon taraf ikatthi huin or gadhy or kavita main apmaan kaa aadan-pradaan karne main do yaa teen saptaah bitaye, jo aaramdaayak duuri se nikaale gaye tiron ke saath samarthit the
 According to Rodinson, three of the attackers and five of the guards were dead
 duusari taraf, fasal ikattha kii gai thi or gheraabandi karne waalon ko apane ghodon ke liye bhojan khojane main kuch pareshaani thi, jisane hamale main unke liye koi upyog nahin kiya
 The Quraysh veterans grew impatient with the deadlock
 'amrit ebn' abd vud ke netritv main aatankwaadiyon kaa ek samooh icrima ebn abi jahaan ne khai ke madhyam se jor dene kaa prayaas kiya or ek crossing ko prabhavit karne main kaamyaab rahe, ek marsh par kabja kar liya saalaa ke pahari ke paas kshetra
 Amrit challenged Muslims to a duel
 jawaab main, ali ebn abi talib ne chunauti sweekaar kar lee, or mohammad dwaara ladane ke liye bheja gaya tha
 As Ali went to fight Amrit ibn Abd Wud, Muhammad said of Ali, “he is the embodiment of all faiths going into an encounter with the embodiment of all disbelief
 " The two warriors were lost in the dust as the duel deepened
 aakhirkaar, sainikon ne chikhen sunai jo nirnaayak oochaal kaa sanket diya, lekin yah spasht nahin tha ki donon main se koun sa safal rahaa
 The slogan, 'allahu Akbar' from Dust, confirmed Ali's victory
 sanghon ko aatank or bhram kii sthiti main waapas lene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Ali, according to his principles, allowed Amrit's intrusion to retreat; Ali never pursued the fleeing enemy
 sangheey sena ne raat ke dauraan khai paar karne ke kai anya prayaas kiye lekin baar-baar vifal rahe
 Although the Confederates could deploy their infantry over the entire length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims in close quarters as the former considered it better to fight hand-to-hand with the latter
 chunki muslim sena prithvi se bane tatbandh ke peeche acchhee tarah se khod gai thi, jise khai se liya gaya tha or hamalaavaron ko pattharon or tiron se bambaari karne ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya tha, kisi bhi hamale se badi sankhya main maare gaye
 The Confederates then attempted attacks several times, most notably trying to persuade Banu Quraiza to attack Muslims from the south
 kanfederates se, huyayi ebn akhtab, nirvasit janajati banu nadir ke netaa khabian, muslimon ke khilaaf unke samarthan kii maang main madina laut aae
 By now the Banu Quraiza had tried their best to remain neutral, and were very hesitant about joining the Confederates as they had previously made a pact with Muhammad
 jab akhtab ne unase sampark kiya, to unke netaa ne unhen pravesh karne se inkaar kar diya
 He eventually managed to enter and convince them that the Muslims would certainly be overwhelmed
 vishaal sangheey senaaon kii drushti, jahaan tak ankhon ko dekha ja saktaa tha, sainikon or ghodon ke saath bhoomi par chadhate hue, sangh ke paksh main kuraiya raay ko ghumaya
 News of Quraizah's anticipated renunciation of the pact with Muhammad came out, and Umar immediately informed Muhammad
 kuraija ke gadhon kii ore dushman sainikon ke andolan se is tarah ke andeh ko majboot kiya gaya tha
 Muhammad became concerned about his conduct, and Quraiza realized a serious potential danger
 kuraija ke saath apane samjhaute ke kaaran, unhone janajati ke saath musalamaanon kii seemaa ke saath rakshaatmak taiyaari karne ke liye pareshaan nahin kiya tha
 The Quraiza also had weapons: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armor, and 500 shields
 mohammad ne haal ke ghatnakramon ke vivaran laane ke liye teen pramukh musalamaanon ko bheja
 He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they be loyal to Banu Quraiza, so as to boost the morale of Muslim fighters
 haalanki, unhone kuraija ke hisse par samjhaute ke sambhavit ulanghan kii khabar failaane ke khilaaf chetavanee di, taaki muslim rankon main kisi bhi aatank se bachane ke liye
 The leaders found that the settlement was indeed abandoned and tried to prove them futile by bringing them back to Quraiza, reminding them of the fate of Banu Nadir and Banu Kayanuka at the hands of Muhammad
 netaaon ke nishkarsh mohammad ko ek roopak main sanketit kiya gaya tha: " adal or karah "
 Because the people of Adal and Qarah betrayed the Muslims and killed them at an opportune moment, Maududi believes that the metaphor means that Quraiza was about to do so
 mohammad ne banu kuraija kii gatividhiyon ke bare main apana gyaan chhipaane kaa prayaas kiya; haalanki, afvaahen jald hi kuraiza ke paksh se madina shahar par baari hamale ke fail gayi, jo ki medinance ko gambhir rup se nicha dikhaati thim
 The Muslims found themselves in great difficulties by the day
 khaanaa kam chal rahaa tha, or raaten thandi thim
 Lack of sleep made matters worse
 to tanaav yah tha ki, pehali baar, muslim samudaay dwaara dainik dainik prarthanaaon ko upekshit kiya gaya tha
 Only at night, when the attacks ceased due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship
 ebn ishaak ke anusaar, sthiti gambhir ho gai or dar har jagah tha
 The Quran describes the situation of Surah al-ahzab: kuraija ke bare main afvaahen sunne ke turant baad, mohammad ne apni suraksha ke liye aantarik logon ko 100 logon ko bheja tha
 Later he sent 300 cavalry to defend the city
 joardaar awaazen, jisamen sena ne har raat prarthana kii, ek badi takat kaa bhram paidaa kiya
 The crisis showed Muhammad that many of his men had reached the limits of their endurance
 unhone ghatafan ko shabd bheja, apane vichlan ke liye bhugtan karne kii koshish kii or unhen waapas le jane par madina kii taarikh kii fasal kaa teesraa hissaa diya
 Although Ghatfan made half the demand, they agreed to negotiate with Muhammad on those terms
 mohammad ne samjhaute ko taiyaar karne kaa aadesh shuru karne se pehle, unhone medin ke netaaon se paraamarsh kiya
 He swiftly rejected the terms of the agreement, the opposition to Medina was never sunk to the level of such humiliation
 baatcheet tut gai thi
 While Ghatfan did not go back, he compromised himself by entering into negotiations with Medina, and increased internal dissolution of the Confederacy
 us bindu par, mohammad ko ek arab netaa nuyam ebn masood se ek yatra mili, jise puure sangh dwaara sammanit kiya gaya tha, lekin jo unhen agyaat tha, gupt rup se islam main parivartit ho gaya tha
 Muhammad asked them to end the siege by creating a dispute between the Confederates
 Nuaym to ek kushal stratagem ke saath aayaa tha
 He first went to Banu Quraiza and warned him about the intentions of the rest of the Confederacy
 agar gheraabandi vifal ho jaati he, to unhone kaha, sangheey yahudiyon ko tyaagane se dar nahin paaegaa, unhen mohammad kii dayaa par chhod degaa
 Thus Qureja should demand union leaders as hostages in exchange for cooperation
 yah salaah kuraiza pehle se hi darane vaale dar par chhu gai thi
 Next Nu'am went to the Confederate leader's Abu Sufyan, warning him that Quraiza had defected to Muhammad
 unhone kaha ki janajati kaa uddeshy bandhakon ke liye sanghatan se poochna he, jaahir he ki sahyog ke badale main, lekin vastav main mohammad ko saunpna he
 Thus mobilization should not give a person as a mortgage
 Nuaym sangh main anya janajatiyon ko ek hi sandesh doharaaya
 Nuame's cleverness was done
 paraamarsh ke baad, sangh ke netaaon ne icrima ko kuraija ko bheja, madina ke ekajute akraman ko sanket diya
 However, Quraiza demanded the hostages as a guarantee that federalism would not desert them
 kanfederency, is baat par vichaar karte hue ki kuraija mohammad ko bandhak de saktaa he, inkaar kar diya
 Repeated messages were sent between the parties, but each held its own stubborn position
 abu sufaan ne huyayi ebn akhtab ko bulaayaa, unhen kuraija kii pratikriya ke bare main suchit kiya
 Huayi was recaptured, and Abu Sufyan branded him as a "traitor"
 apane jivan ke liye darate hue, huyayi kuraija ke gadhon main bhaag gaya
 The Bedouins, Ghatfans and other associations of Najd were compromised before Muhammad's negotiations
 unhone islam ke khilaaf kisi bhi vishesh purvaagrah ke bajaay lut kii ummid main abhiyaan main bhaag liya tha
 He lost hope as his chances of success diminished, with no interest in continuing the siege
 do sangheey senaaon ko bhedbhaav or parsparik avishvaas dwaara chihnit kiya gaya tha
 Provisions for Confederate armies were running out
 ghode or oont bhukhe or ghaavon se mar rahe the
 The weather was exceptionally cold and wet for days
 sangheey sena se garmi ke strot ko dur le jane se hinsak hawaaon ne shivi kii aag uda di
 The Muslim camp, however, was sheltered from such winds
 dushman ke tambu faad gaye the, unki aag bujh gai thi, unke chehre main ret or barish hui thi, or ve unke khilaaf bandargahon se dar gaye the
 They had already fallen into themselves
 raat ke dauraan sangheey senaayen waapas le leen, or subah tak jameen sabhi dushman balon se saafe ho gai
 After the retreat of the Confederate army, the Banu Quraija neighborhood was surrounded by revenge Muslims
 apane pados ke 25 dinon kii gheraabandi ke baad banu kuraiya ne bina shart aatmasamarpan kiya
 When the Banu Quraiza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army confiscated their strongholds and their possessions
 banu aus ke anurodh par, jo kuraija se jude the, mohammad ne unamem se ek chunaa, saad ebn muaad, un par nirnay lene ke liye ek madhyasth ke rup main chunaa
 Saad, who would die after his wounds from the war, sentenced according to the Torah, in which men would be killed and women and children would be slaves
 vyavasthavivaran 20: 10-14 kahata he: When you march to attack a city, offer peace to your people
 agar ve apane dwaar sweekaar karte hai or kholte hai, to isamen sabhi log majaboor shram ke adheen honge or aapke liye kaam karenge
 If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in war, then lay siege to that city
 jab tumhaara parameshwar yahova ise tumhaare haath main pahunchaata he, to usamen talwaar ko rakho
 For women, children, animals and everything else in the city, you can take them as loot
 or aap lut kaa upyog kar sakate hai bhagwaan tumhaara bhagwaan aapako apane dushmano se detaa he
 Muhammad approved the decision, and was sentenced the next day
 purushon - 400 or 900 ke bich sankhya - mohammad ebn maslama kii hiraasat main bandhe or rakhe gaye the, jabaki mahilaon or bacchon ko abdulla ebn salaam ke adheen rakhaa gaya tha, jo ek purv rabbi islam main parivartit ho gaya tha
 Ibn Ishaq described the killing of the Banu Quraiza men as follows: vibhinn musalamaanon ne unki taraf se hastkshep karte samay kai logon ko bachaaya tha
 Many accounts note Muhammad's companions as executors, Umar and al-zubayr in particular, and each dynasty of Aws was also accused of killing a group of Quraiza men
 ebn ishaak kii mohammad kii jeevani ke mutabik, ek aurat jisane gheraabandi ke dauraan yudhon se milakar pathar phenk diya tha or muslim gheraabandi main se ek ko maar daalaa tha, bhi purushon ke saath sir kaata gaya tha
 Aisha, one of Mohammed's wives, is described as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, by which time her name was called: 'allaah gavaah he' unhon ne kaha, 'vah main hoon
 'I said to him' You poor soul, what is happening to you? ' He said: "I should be killed
 " "kyun kar?" maine usase poocha
 "I did something," he answered
 vah chali gayi or sir kaata gaya
 Allah knows, i will never forget his cheerfulness and his great laugh when he knew how to kill him
 ' Ibn Askir has written in his history of Damascus that Banu Qilab, a group of Arab customers of Banu Quraiza, was also killed

 The crisis deepened and things got worse 


 samaaroh sunni, haddees sangrah sahih al bukhari main sanderbhit he, yah saad ebn muaad kii mrityu kaa ullekh karata he, jaisaa ki nimnanusaar he: The Sahih al-bukhari collection also mentions that after the war, Muslims were to carry out offensive attacks against their enemies: musalamaanon ne murtipujakon ke khilaaf hamale ke hamalon ko rokane ke liye bulaae jane ke liye, unhone apane anuyaayiyon se pehle kaha: abdulla bin abu aupha ne bataaya: allaah ke macenjar ek samay main jab usne dushman kaa saamana kiya, or vah intjaar kar rahaa tha set karne ke liye suraj khadaa hua or kaha, "he log! dushman kaa saamana karne ke liye lambey samay tak nahin rahen or aapako suraksha pradaan karne ke liye allaah ko prarthana karen
 But when you face the enemy, show patience and perseverance, and keep in mind that Janna is under the shadow of the swords
 " tab usne allaah se kaha, "he allaah, pustak kaa khulaasa, badalon ke preshak, kanfederates ke haarane vaale, hamaare dushman ko maarg main daalkar unhen adhik shakti dene main madad karte hai"
