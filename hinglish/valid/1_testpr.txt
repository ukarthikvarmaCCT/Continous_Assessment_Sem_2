 Viewed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope, it has been found that M31 contains billions of stars, many more than our planetary planets whose number is about c
 200-400 billion
 
 While in 2006, the galaxy's planets were estimated at ~ 80% compared to Andromeda, which is roughly equivalent to 7
1 × 1011 solar planets, a 2009 study showed that the density of Andromeda and the Akash Ganga is roughly the same

 Charles Messier listed it as the M31 planet in 1764 and was erroneously credited as an explorer to Marius, who was unaware of Sufi al's earlier work
 1785 main, khagolvid wiliam harshal ne M31 ke pramukh kshetra main dhundhlee laal rang varna kaa ullekh kiya
 He believed that it was closest to the "great Nebula" and based on the color and size of the nebula, he miscalculated that it was no more than 2000 times larger than Sirius' distance
 1864 main wiliam hagins ne M31 ke varnakram kaa avlokan kiya or yah paaya ki yah gasiy nebula se bhinn he
 The spectra of M31 form deep absorption lines exhibiting a continuum of frequencies as layers that help identify a chemical mixture of a substance
 andromeda nebula bahut adhik alag taron ke spectra ke samaan tha jisase isaki utpatti hui jisamen M31 kii taarakeey prakruti thi
 In 1885, the supernova was first seen in the M31, which was seen only once in this galaxy
 us samay M31 ko sabase nazadiiki grah mana gaya tha, isliye vastu paas tha ek vichaar karne ke liye he, isliye is kalpana ko bahut adhik lokapriyata nahin mil saki or is asambaddha ghatana ko nova kaha gaya or iskaa naam "nova 1885" ke anusaar rakhaa gaya
 The first photograph of the M31 was taken by Isaac Robert in 1857 at his private observatory, Sussex, England
 lambii avadhi ke khulaase ke baad tarapunj kii sarpilaakaar sanrachana ko pehali baar dekha gaya
 However, at that time it was generally considered to be a nebula in our galaxy and Robert mistakenly thought that the M31 and similar spiral nebula were in fact the form of the structure of the solar system that was taken with the help of satellite Nessant planets
 hamaari saura pranali ke sambandh main is grah ke trigyakaar veg ko 1912 main vesto slifer dwaara lowell vedhashala main, spectroscopy kaa upyog karke mapa gaya tha
 As a result, at that time, its velocity was recorded very fast in the direction of the sun at 300 kilometres per second

 So he became the proponent of the so-called "island universe", the spiral nebula that was actually an independent galaxy
 1920 main, harley shorpale or curtis ke bich akaash ganga, sarpilaakaar nebula or brahmad ke aayam se sambandhit mahaan bahes aarambh ho gai
 In support of the claim that the great Andromeda Nebula was externally tarapunz, Curtis observed the texture of dark lines resembling foggy clouds in our tarapunj and observed a characteristic doppler shift
 1922 main, arnest opic ne M31 kii duuri ke akalan kaa ek bahut hi sundar or saral khagoleey vidhi prastut kii
 He placed our Tarapanja at about 450 KPC from Andromeda, which is about 1500 KLY

 Andromeda played an important role in the study of galaxies, as it is the closest spiral galaxy
 1943 main, walter bade andromeda akashganga ke kendriya kshetra main taron kaa samaadhaan nikaalane vaala pehla vyakti tha
 Based on observations of this galaxy, based on his observations about it, he was able to identify two stars based on their metallicity, namely the high-velocity stars in the Young Disc Type i and the Type II reds emerging in the Old Age

 Close to its core, various 1,300 light-years have been observed at a radius of light-year with a high rotational velocity of 225 kilometres per second and then a minimum drop of 7,000 light-years with a rotational velocity of up to 50 kilometres per second

 Following this, it is found that the small galaxy passed along Andromeda's disk along the polar axis of the latter
 Its collision caused more than half of the smaller M32's bodies to break apart and create a ring ring in Andromeda
 M31 ke bade hue prabhamandal ke adhyayan se pataa laga ki isaki tulana akashganga ke saath karnaa sambhav nahin kyonki taron ke prabhamandal main aamtaur par "aparyaapt dhaatu" hoti hai jo duuri badhane ke saath-saath badhati chali jaati hai
 These evidences show that both galaxies follow the same evolutionary path

 cendrak kii chamak adhik chamkile golakaar jhund kii adhikta he
 In 1991, Todd R
 Lear used the WFPC and was later set up to take images of the inner nucleus of Andromeda to the Hubel space telescope
 cendrak main do sanyojaktaayen hai jo 1
5 parsek dwaara alag kii jaati hai
 The luminous valence is designed in P1, equivalent to the galaxy center
 P2 kii dhundhlee sanyojaktaa akashganga ke centre main sthit he or 3-5x107m☉ blike hole sthit he
 Scott Tramanne suggested that the interpretation of the observed double nucleus is possible if the P1 central black hole had a projection of the image of the star in the focal chamber around the stars
 uski utkendratha is prakaar kii he ki taare kakshiya apocenter se jude rahete hai jinke kaaran taron kii abhimukhataa main vruddhi hoti he
 P2 has a dense disc of hot spectral class a stars

 Whereas, at the time of its initial discovery, it was hypothesized that the luminosity of the double nucleus was the remaining part of the small galaxy "cannibalized" near Andromenda, after which there was no clear explanation
 iskaa mul kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke cendrak kaa kendriya blike hole dwaara utaar-chadhaav vaale vyavdhaan ke kaaran jeevankaal atyadhik chota ho jaataa he
 While partially resolving it is possible if P1 has its own stabilizing black hole, the upheaval in P1 does not mean that it has a black hole at its center
 vishesh rup se, 1968 ke ant tak akashganga kaa koi eks-re nahin liya gaya tha
 On 20 October 1970, the upper limits of detectable hard X-rays from the M31 were set

 It has several million stars and has twice the brightness of Omega Centauri, known as the brightest spherical beam in the galaxy
 globular 1 main kai taarakeey sankhya bahut adhik he or saamaanya golakaar ke liye inaki sanrachana bahut adhik saghan hoti he
 As a result, some consider G1 to be a small part of a small galaxy that was considered M31 some time ago
 globular kii sabase adhik spasht chamak G76 ke samaan he jo uske purvi bhaag main dakshini-purvi bhaag main sthit he
 In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely different type of star mass in M31
 khoja gaya nayaa tara punj main karodo taare shaamil thim or inhen vartulakaar punjon main iske samaan sankhya main anya taare khoje ja sakate hai
 What makes them different from circular groups is that they are larger - several hundred light years larger - and many times less dense than them
 isliye, taron ke bich duuri haal hi main khoje gaye vistaarit punjon main kaaphi adhik he
 Similar to the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy consists of satellite galaxies numbered 14 smaller galaxies
 sabase acchhee jaankaree vaali or sabase adik dekhi jane vaali upgrah akashganga M32 or M110 hai
 Based on current evidence, it appears that the M32 has a very close encounter with the M31
 M32 kabhi bahut badi akashganga rahi hogi jiske baad M31 ne iske taarakeey bimb ko hataa diya or iske antarbhag main taare ke nirmaan main badi teji ke saath vruddhi hui jisaki samaapti uske baad ho gai
 The M110 may also have come into contact with M31, and astronomers discovered metal-rich stars in the M31's halo that appear as lines from these satellite galaxies
 M110 ke dhul nahin he jo haal kii or vartmaan taare kii banaavat kii taraf ingit karata he
 In 2006, it was discovered that nine of these galaxies are parallel, dividing the core of the Andromeda galaxy rather than arranging their independent interactions randomly
 This may indicate a normal tidal origin for satellites
 andromeda akashganga, akashganga kii taraf 100 se 140 kilometres per second teji se bad rahi hai, isliye yah sthanantarit hone vaali neeli akashganga main se ek he
 The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are expected to collide after perhaps 450 million years, although its description is uncertain because the relevant velocity of Andromeda can only be compared to the Milky Way based on one or two components
 is takkar ke parinamswaroop ye akashganga ek vishalkay andakaar akashganga rup main parivartit ho jaaengi

 mahabharat hinduon kaa ek pramukh kavy granth he, jo smriti ke itihaas varg main aata he
 Sometimes it is simply called "india"
 yah kavyagranth bharat kaa anupam dharmik, puranic, aitihaasik or darshanik granth hai
 It is the world's longest literary text and epic, one of the main texts of Hinduism
 is granth ko hindu dharm main pancham veda mana jaataa he
 Although it is considered to be one of the most unique works of literature, even today, this book is an exemplary source for every Indian
 yah kriti pracheen bharat ke itihaas kii ek gaatha he
 In this, the most sacred book of Hinduism is contained in the Bhagavad Gita
 puure mahabharat main lagbhag 1,10,000 shloke hai, jo unani kaavyon elliod or odissi se pariman main das guna adhik hai
 According to Hindu beliefs, mythological references and the Mahabharata itself, the creator of this poem is considered to be Vedavas ji
 is kavy ke rachayita vedavyas ji ne apane is anupam kavy main vedon, vedangon or upanishdon ke guhyatam rahasyon kaa nirupan kiya hai
 Apart from this, justice, education, medicine, astrology, warfare, yogashastra, economics, architecture, craftsmanship, kamshastra, astronomy and theology are also described in detail in this poem
 vedavyas ji ko mahabharat puraa rachane main 3 varsh lag gayi the, iskaa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki us samay lekhan lipi kala kaa itnaa vikaas nahi hua tha, us kaal main rishiyon dwaara vaidic granthon ko peedi dar peedi paramparaagat maukhik rup se yaad karke surakshit rakhaa jaataa tha
 Sanskrit was the language of the sages at that time and Brahmi was the language of common language
 is prakaar rishiyon dwaara sampoorn vaidic sahitya maukhik rup se yaad kar peedi dar peedi sahastron varshon tak yaad rakhaa gaya
 Then gradually, with the fall of the Vedic era due to the influence of time, the style of memorizing the Vedic literature of the sages disappeared, since then the practice of writing Vedic literature on manuscripts became safe
 yah sarvamaanya he ki mahabharat kaa aadhunik rup kai avasthaaon se guzar kar bana he
 Four early stages of its creation have been identified by scholars

 The Mahabharata is a story of a war between two families of the Kauravas and the Pandavas of the Chandravanshi
 100 kaurav bhaaiyon or paanch pandav bhaaiyon ke bich bhoomi ke liye jo sangharsh chalaa usase antat: mahabharat yuddh kaa srijan hua
 Several different dates have been set by Indian and Western scholars of this war
 mukhya ullekh :mahabharat kii vistrut katha According to the Puranas, Brahma was born from Atri, Atri to the Moon, Moon to Mercury and Mercury to ila-nandan Pururava
 unase aayu, aayu se raja nahush or nahush se yayati utpann hue
 Purified by Yayati
 puru ke vansh main bharat or bharat ke kul main raja kuru hue
 Shantanu happened in the lineage of Kuru
 shantanu se ganganandan bhishma utpann hue
 From Shantanu, Chitrangad and Vichitravirya were born from Satyavati's womb
 chitrangad naam vaale gandharv ke dwaara maare gayi or raja vichitraveery rajyakshma se grast ho swargavaasi ho gayi
 Then by the order of Satyavati, Vyasji produced Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika and Pandu from the womb of Ambalika by Neog
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari dwaara sau putron ko janm diya, jinamein duryodhana sabase bada tha or pandu ke yudhistor, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was made king in his place
 ek baar van main akhet khelte hue pandu ke baan se ek maithunarat mrigarupadhari rishi kii mrityu ho gayi
 Cursed by that sage, "now whenever you are maltreated, you will die", Pandu becomes very sad and abandons all lusts including his queens and makes Dhritarashtra in Hastinapur to live in the forest
 raja pandu ke kehane par kunti ne durvasa rishi ke diye mantra se dharm ko aamantrit kar unase yudhisthir or kaalaantar main vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna ko utpann kiya
 Madri gave birth to that mantra from Kunti and gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva from Ashwankumar
 ek din raja pandu maadri ke saath van main sarita ke tat par bhraman karte hue pandu ke man chanchal ho jane se maithun main pravruth huye jisase shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons
 kunti ne vivaah se pehle surya ke ansh se karn ko janm diya or loklaj ke bhay se karn ko ganga nadi main baha diya
 Adhiratha, the charioteer of Dhritarashtra, saved him and followed him
 karn kii ruchi yudhkala main thi atah dronacharya ke manaa karne par usne parashuram se shiksha praapt kii
 Duryodhana tried to kill the Pandavas many times in his childhood due to Shakuni's treachery and even in his youth, when Yudhishthira was made the crown prince, he tried to send the Pandavas to Lakshagraha, the home of Laksha, and burn them with fire, but the aid of Vidur
 Due to this, they got out of that burning house
 pandav vahaan se ekachakra nagari gayi or muni kaa vesh banaakar ek brahman ke ghar main nivas karne lage
 Then at the behest of Vyas ji, he went to Panchal kingdom where Draupadi was going to be a swayamvara
 vahaan ek ke baad ek sabhi raajaaon evam rajkumaron ne machhlee par nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi
 After this, Arjuna, seeing the reflection in Telapatra, penetrated Matsya with a single arrow and Draupadi went ahead and put a garland on Arjun's neck
 mata kunti ke vachananusaar paanchon pandavon ne draupadi ko patnirup main praapt kiya
 At the time of Draupadi's swayamvara, along with Duryodhana, Drupada, Dhritadumayan and many others had suspected that they were only five Brahmin Pandavas
 atah unki pariksha karne ke liye drupad ne unhen apane rajaprasaad main bulaayaa
 In Rajprasad, Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna showed the first treasury but the Pandavas did not show any interest in Ratnabhushans and ratna-manikya etc
 kept there
 kintu jab ve shastraagaar main gayi to vahaan rakhe astr-shastron main un sabhi ne bahut adhik ruchi dikhaayi or apni pasand ke shastron ko apane paas rakh liya
 Their activity convinced Drupada that they are Pandavas as Brahmins
 draupadi swayamvar se purv vidura ko chhodkar sabhi pandavon ko mrit samajhane lage or is kaaran dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya
 In order to avoid the crisis of civil war, Yudhishthira accepted Khandav forest as half the state in the ruins given by Dhritarashtra
 vahaan arjuna ne shrikrishna ke saath milakar samast devataaon ko yuddh main parrast karte hue khandvavan ko jala diya or indra ke dwaara kii hui vrishti kaa apane baanon ke chhatrakaar band se nivaaran karke agni dev ko trupt kiya
 As a result, Arjuna received the divine Gandiva bow and the best chariot from Agnidev and Shri Krishna received the Sudarshan Chakra
 indra apane putr arjuna kii veerta dekhakar atiprasann hue
 He removed the forests of Khandavaprastha
 uske uparaant pandavon ne shrikrishna ke saath may daanav kii sahaayta se us shahar kaa soundaryikaran kiya
 The city became like a second heaven
 indra ke kehane par dev shilpi vishwakarma or may daanav ne milakar khandav van ko indrapuri jitne bhavy nagar main nirmit kar diya, jise indraprastha naam diya gaya
 The Pandavas, while conquering all directions, performed a Rajsuya yagna, complete with abundant gold
 unka vaibhav duryodhana ke liye asay ho gaya atah shakuni, karn or duryodhana aadi ne yudhisthir ke saath jue main pravrutt hokar uske bhaaiyo, draupadi or unke rajya ko kapat dyut ke dwaara hanste-hanste jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But Gandhari came and stopped this from happening
 dhritarashtra ne ek baar phir duryodhana kii prerana se unhen se jua khilne kii ajna di
 It was decided that whichever side would lose in a single stake, they would wear deer for twelve years and remain in exile for one year
 us ek varsh main bhi yadi unhen pahchaan liya gaya to phir se baarah varsh kaa vanvaas bhogana hoga
 Thus Yudhishthira, after being defeated in gambling, went to the forest with his brothers
 vahaan barahawaan varsh bitne par ek varsh ke agyatavaas ke liye ve viraat nagar main gayi
 When the Kauravas started carrying Virat's cows, they were defeated by Arjuna
 us samay kauravon ne pandavon ko pahchaan liya tha parantu unka kaa agyatavaas tab tak puraa ho chukaa tha
 But even after completing 12 years of known and one-year exile, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 bhishma ne das dinon tak yuddh karke pandavon kii adhikansh sena ko apane baanon se maar giraaya
 Bhishma's death was subject to his will
 shrikrishna ke suzav par pandavon ne bhishma se hi unki mrityu kaa upaay poocha
 Bhishma said that the Pandavas fought the battle in front of Shikhandi
 bhishma use kanya hi maanate the or use saamne paakar wo shastr nahin chalaane vaale the
 And Shikhandi also had to avenge the humiliation of his previous birth and for that he took a boon from Shiva that Bhishma's death would be the reason
 10ve din ke yuddh main arjuna ne shikhandi ko aage apane rath par bithaaya or shikhandi ko saamne dekh kar bhishma ne apana dhanush tyaag diya or arjuna ne apni banvrishti se unhen baanon ki shayya par sula diya
 Then Acharya Drona assumed the charge of generalship
 phir se donon paksho main bada bhayankar yuddh hua
 Virat and Drupada etc
 were drowned in the sea by King Dronopi
 lekin jab pandavo ne chhal se dron ko yah vishwaas dilaa diya ki ashwatthama maaraa gaya
 So Acharya Drona was disappointed and gave up his weapon and left his body after taking yoga samadhi
 aise samay main dhridhyumna ne yoga samadhi liye dron kaa mastak talwaar se kaat kar bhoomi par gira diya
 After Drona slaughter, Karna became the captain of the Kaurava army
 karn or arjuna main bhanti-bhanti ke astr-shastron se yukt mahabhayanak yuddh hua, jo devasur-sangram ko bhi maat karne vaala tha
 In the battle of Karna and Arjuna, Karna killed many heroes of the enemy side with his arrows
 yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya
 Due to the curse of Guru Parshuram, he finds himself unable to use the divine weapons and comes down to remove the wheel of the chariot
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna ko uske dwaara kiye abhimanyu vadh, kuru sabha main draupadi ko veshya or uski karn vadh karne kii pratigya yaad dilaakar use maarane ko kehete he, tab arjuna ne ek divine astr se karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 Subsequently, King Shalya became the commander of the Kaurava army, but he could last only half a day in the war
 dopaher hote-hote raja yudhisthir ne unhen maar diya
 Duryodhana's entire army was killed, and in the end he had a miserable battle with Bhimsen
 bhim ne chhal se uski jaangh par prahaar karke use maar daalaa
 To take revenge of this, Ashwatthama put an Akshauhini army of Pandavas, the five sons of Draupadi, her Panchaldeshi brothers and Dhritadhyumna to sleep forever
 tab arjuna ne ashwatthama ko parrast karke uske mastak kii mani nikaal lee
 Ashwatthama then used Brahmastra on Uttara's womb
 uskaa garbh uske astr se praaia dagdh ho gaya tha, kintu bhagwaan shrikrishna ne usko pun: jivan-daan diya
 The same womb of Uttara later became known as King Parikshit
 is yuddh ke ant main kritavarma, kripacharya tathaa ashwatthama teen kauravapakshiya or paanch pandav, saatyaki tathaa shrikrishna ye saat pandavapakshiya vir jivit bache
 Yudhishthira then came to the throne
 brahmanon or gandhari ke shaap ke kaaran yadavakul kaa sanhaar ho gaya
 Balbhadra left his body with yoga and went into the ocean as Sheshnag
 bhagwaan krishna ke sabhi praputra ek din mahamuniyon kii shakti dekhne ke liye ek ko stri banaakar muniyon ke paas gaye or poocha ki he munishreshth! yah mahila garbh se he, hamen bataaen ki iske garbh se kiskaa janm hoga? muniyon ko gyaat hua ki yah balak unase krida karte hue ek purush ko mahila bana unke paas laae hai
 The sages cursed Krishna's great-grandchildren that a pestle will lick from this human's womb, which will end your dynasty
 krishna ke prapautron nen us moosal ko pathar par ragad kar chura bana nadi main baha diya tathaa uske nok ko phenk diya
 All of Krishna's great-grandchildren died from the leaves of the tree produced from that powder
 yah dekh shrikrishna bhi ek ped ke neeche dhyaan lagaakar beth gayi
 a hunter named 'zara' placed the tip of the pestle on the tip of his arrow and struck the arrow with the footstool of Lord Krishna as an antelope
 us baan dwaara krishna ke pair kaa chumban unke paramdhaam gaman kaa kaaran bana
 The Lord departed Goloka with his entire body
 iske baad samudr ne dwarkapuri ko apane jal main dubaa diya
 Subsequently, upon hearing the news of the destruction of the Yadavas from the mouth of Arjuna returning from Dwarka, Yudhishthira, considering the impermanence of the world, placed Parikshit on the Rajasana and took Draupadi and the brothers along the path of Mahaprasthana towards the Himalayas
 us mahapath main yudhisthir ko chhod sabhi ek-ek karke gir pade
 In the end, Yudhishthira climbed on Indra's chariot and went to heaven with his brothers

 In fact, many stories are popular about him and his contemporary Jalandharnath and Krishnapada
 gorakhnath or matsyendranath-vishyak samast kahaniyon ke anushilan se kai baaten spasht rup se jaani ja sakati hai
 First, that Matsyendranath and Jalandharnath were contemporary; Secondly, Matsyendranath was the Guru of Gorakhnath and Jalandharnath was the Guru of Kanupa or Krishnapada; Thirdly, that Matsyendranath was once the originator of the yog-marg, then incidentally got involved in an ethos in which uninterrupted association with women was the main thing - possibly it was the Vamachari Sadhana; - fourth, that from the very beginning, the cultivation of Jalandhar Nath and Kanipa - The method was different from the practice of Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath
 yah spasht he ki kisi ek kaa samay bhi maaloom ho to baaki sidhon ke samay kaa pataa asaani se lag jayega

 plato is academy kaa ant tak pradhan acharya bana rahaa

 Plato studied the ideas of all the philosophers of his predecessor and made a substantial accumulation of the best of all, for example, 'mileusian matter', 'pythagoras' form ',' Heraclitus ',' The ultimate truth of Parmenides ',' Geno The dialectical logic of 'and Sukrat's suffixism' were the main sources of his philosophy

 He was of the view that "poetry is an imitation of the world, the world itself is an imitation; therefore the poem is twice as far from the truth
 vah bhaavon ko udwelit kar vyakti ko kumargami banaati he
 Hence the poem is unusable and the importance of the poet is less than a cobbler
 "rachanaayen The name of his dialogue is particularly notable in Plato's major works

 His dialogues can be divided into three parts- plato kii rachanaaon main 'da republic', 'da statsman', 'da laag', 'eon', 'chimposium' aadi pramukh hai
 Plato acknowledges the importance of poetry to the same extent as it helps to establish the sense of truth, virtue among citizens of the Republic

 clay court kuchle hue shell, pathar or eenton dwaara banaaya jaataa he
 Red clay is slower than green clay or American necklace-true clay
 french open clay corts main hi khelaa jaataa he, jo ise grand slam kii anya pratiyogitaayen ke madhya vishisht darja detaa he
 Clay courts are more prevalent in the European continent and Latin America than in the United States, Canada or Britain
 sanyukt rajya america main hari mitti dwaara bane court, jinhen "rubiko" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, ko praayah "clay" hi kaha jaataa he, lekin vah us mitti dwaara nahin bane hote hai jo adhikansh europea or latin america deshon main prayog kii jaati he
 Although it is cheaper to build than other types of tennis grounds, the cost of maintenance is higher because the surface has to be continuously aligned to maintain flatness
 isamen pani ke str kaa santulan banaaye rakhana bhi bahut zaruri hota he; pani nikaalte rahane ke liye hare maidan praayah dhalyukt banaaye jate hai
 Clay courts support "full western grip" for more topspin
 clay court dhime maane jate hai, kyonki inamen gend apekshaakrit oonchi kintu dhimi gati se uchhalati he, jisase khilaadi ke liye gend dwaara aisa vishisht shot khelnaa or bhi kathin ho jaataa he
 It also earns more points because the number of winners is less
 isliye, clay court besaline khilaadiyon, jo drudh hote hai or aamtaur par adhik rakshaatmak hote hai, ke liye adhik sahaayak hote hai, iske dwaara refel nadal, jorn borg or justin henin jaise khilaadiyon ko french open main kaaphi safalataa praapt hui
 aakraamak besaline khilaadi jinke groundstroke bahut shaktishaalee hote hai, unhen bhi clay court main kaaphi safalataa mili he
 This fact proves particularly true for taller players because the ball is still within the height they can hit even after bouncing, by twice, the players reaching the final round of the French Open, Robin Soldering and Women players like Anna Ivanovich, Jelena Jankovic and Diana Safina have also found success in clay courts
 clay court main khilne vaale khilaadi one virdohi khilaadi se bachane ke liye topspin kaa prayog karte hai
 In gravel-built fields the ball speed varies significantly from any other surface ground
 mitti par khilne aksar karne ke liye stroke ke dauraan gend main slide karne kii kshamta, ke rup main chal rahaa he or ek kathin yaa ghaas kii tarah court par roak kaa virodh shaamil he
 Ability to move the ball is often required during the stroke to play on the soil, while the ball can be stopped only by running hard or on grass fields
 aise khilaadi jo mitti ke maidaanon par bahut badhiya pradarshan karte hai lekin tej gati vaale maidaanon par unhen pradarshan kaa vahi str banaaye rakhane ke liye bahut sangharsh karnaa padataa he, aise khilaadiyon ko clay-court specialist ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Another feature of clay courts is that they leave their mark when the ball bounces, which allows them to determine whether the ball was off the ground or inside
 Critics of the red soil point to its following shortcomings: These grounds have to be constantly named, if the surface dries up, there are many problems in the construction of the new surface, and the stains resulting from it also spoil the dress and shoes
 Let's go
 mitti teen bhinn prakaar kii hoti he: Not all red "clay" plains are made of natural clay, but rather are made of shred of bricks that are deposited to form the ground
 iske baad is chure rupi mitti ko anya tatv ke chure se puri tarah se dhak diya jaataa he
 This type of surface does not absorb water easily and is highly operational in Europe and Latin America
 prakritik mitti se bane vaastavik maidan bahut hi kam milte hai kyonki unhen puri tarah se sookhne main do se teen din kaa samay lagata he
 a good example of natural red clay can be seen at the Frick Park Clay Courts in Pittsburgh, PA
 These are six red clay grounds designed for public convenience that have been in use since 1930

 is vivaadaaspad parivartan abhi bhi do khilaadiyon ke paksh se sweekruti praapt karne ke liye lambit he
 Meanwhile, effective since 2009, an outdoor ground has already been built with these materials so that players can test it
 Current Open Director Manuel Santana assured that, in addition to color, this surface has all the features of traditional red clay
 halia varshon main mitti ke maidaanon par khilne vaali sabase safal mahila khilaadi justin henin raheen hai, unhone french open ekal khitaab chaar baar jeeta he or 2010 main hi 20 maheene kaa avkaas kaal samaapt kiya he
 His variety of shots, speed and slices have been his important weapons

 Nadal also holds the record for the longest series of wins ever made by a male player on a field: 81 wins recorded on clay fields between April 2005 and May 2007
 Other players who have been successful on clay have included Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Jörn Borg, Evan Lendl, Mats Villander, Monica Seles, Steffi Graf, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario and Gustav Curtain

 thomas muster bhi in maidaanon par ek safal khilaadi maane jate hai
 Although he has won the French Open only once, 40 of his career singles titles have been won on clay
 clay-court visheshgy ek aisa tennis khilaadi hota he jo mitti ke maidaanon par bahut hi badhiya pradarshan karata he, lekin vah sakht maidaanon, ghaas ke maidaanon yaa anya maidaanon par isi str kaa pradarshan nahin kar paata he
 This phrase is mostly used for professional players with ATP or WTA tours in place of average players
 kuch had tak racket takanic main hui pragati ke kaaran, aaj ke clay court lambe or jeet dilaane vaale groundstrokes ke liye prasiddh hai jinase bhari topspin shot paidaa hote hai, ye aise stroke hai jo tej or gend ko adhik oochaal na dene vaale maidaanon par bahut adhik prabhavakaari nahin hote hai
 Clay-court specialist players are able to spin the ball very well on the clay fields of other players
 unamem se kai drop shot lagane main bhi paarangat hote hai, yah is liye prabhavi hota he kyonki mitti ke maidaanon main uchhalayukt shot ke falswaroop khilaadi besaline se kaaphi peeche jane ke liye vivash ho jate hai
 Additionally, a slow and long bouncy shot requires a high degree of mental focus and physical ability by the players

 However, since all these players have won titles only at the French Open, they are sometimes known by this surname
 anya khilaadi, jaise seregi bruguera, albert costa or gaston gaudio, french open ke champion the jinhonen apane sabhi yaa lagbhag sabhi khitaab mitti ke maidaanon par hi jite the
 Among women sportspersons, there were very few players whose best performances were limited to the clay fields
 Virginia Ruzuki, Anastasia Miskina, Eva Mazoli, Sue Barker, Anna Ivanovich and Francesca Schiavone are the only women players to have won top titles at the French Open only since the inception of the Tennis Open Era since 1968
 haal ke varshon main clay court ke na ne anya maidaanon par bhi acha pradarshan karne kaa prayaas kiya he or isamen kuch safalataa bhi praapt kii he
 Ferrero reached the final of the 2003 US Open, the same year he won the French Open and also won hardcourt competitions
 Nadal was also considered a clay-court specialist until winning four Wimbledon finals on grasslands, the Australian Open at Hardcourt in 2009 and the Olympic singles gold at Hardcourt in 2008, before his career Grand Slam 2010 US Open
 And won five master tops in hardcourts, winning four consecutive French Open titles and winning 81 consecutive matches
 jain sahitya bahut vishaal he
 It is mostly religious literature
 sanskrit, praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main yah sahitya likhaa gaya he
 Magadha has been the center of Mahavira's tendencies, so he gave his sermon here in Ardhamagadhi, the lingua franca which is safe among the available Jain proceeds
 ye aagam 45 hai or inhen shwetambar jain pramaan maanate hai, digambar jain nahin
 According to the Dingbar, the Agama literature has been estranged from time immemorial
 digambar shatkhandgam ko sweekaar karte hai jo 12wein angadrushtiwad kaa ansh mana gaya he
 The language of ancient literature of Digambars is Shaurseni
 aage chalakar apbhransh tathaa apbhransh kii uttarkalin lok-bhashaaon main jain panditon ne apni rachanaayen likhakar bhashaa sahitya ko samrudh banaaya
 In the ancient literature, the texts of Jain literature are found in most number and most authentically
 jain rachanakaaron ne puraana kavy, charit kavy, katha kavy, raas kavy aadi vividh prakaar ke granth rache
 Swayambhu, Pushp Dant, Hemachandra, Somprabha Suri etc
 are the main Jain poets
 inhone hinduon main prachlit lok kathaon ko bhi apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or parampara se alag uski parinti apane matanukool dikhaai
 The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 ye aagam 46 hai- The Agam Granth is quite ancient, and the place which is of Vedas in Vedic literature and of Tripitaka in Buddhist literature, the same place is of Agamas in Jain literature
 aagam granthon main mahavir ke upadeshon tathaa jain samskruti se sambandh rakhane vaali anek katha-kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 According to Jain tradition, after 160 years of Mahavira Nirvana, there was a great downturn in Magadha countries, due to which the Jain monks had to relocate elsewhere
 dushkaal samaapt ho jane par shraman patliputra main ekatrit hue or yahan khand-khand karke gyaarah angon kaa sankalan kiya gaya, barahawaan ang kisi ko samaran nahin tha, isliye uskaa sankalan na kiya ja sakaa
 This conference is known as 'pataliputra-vachana'
 kuch samay pashchaat jab aagam sahitya kaa phir viched hone laga to mahavir nirvana ke 827 yaa 840 varsh baad jain saadhuon ke duusare sammelan hue
 One in Mathura under the chairmanship of Aryaskandil and the other under the chairmanship of Nagarjuna Suri
 mathura ke sammelan ko 'maathuri-vaachana' kii sangya di gayi he
 Then after about 150 years, 980 or 993 years after Mahavira Nirvana, the fourth conference of sadhus was held in Vallabhi under the chairmanship of Devardhigini Apology, in which the proceeds were systematically compiled for the last time
 se 'valbhi-vaachana' ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 The present proceeds are the form of this concept
 jain aagmon kii ukt teen sankalanaaon ke itihaas se pataa lagata he ki samay-samay par aagam sahitya ko kaaphi kshati uthaani padi, or yah sahitya apane moulik rup main surakshit nahin rah sakaa
 This seems to be the reason that this literature is very less compared to the Buddhist literature, and it was probably due to the disorder in this literature that the Digambara sect refused to accept it
 isa ke purv lagbhag chauthi shatabdi se lagaakar isvi san paanchavi shatabdi tak kii bharatvarsh kii aarthik tathaa saamaajik dasha kaa chithran karne vaala yah sahitya anek drushtiyon se mahatva kaa he
 a detailed description of the ethos of Jain monks in texts like Ayarang, Suyagdn, Uttarajhayana, Daswayaliya etc
, it corresponds very much to the Buddhist Dhammapada, Suttanipat and Mahabharata etc
 texts, and according to the statements of scholars like Dr
 Vintranij, etc
 - symbolizes poetry
 bhashaa or vishay aadi kii drushti se jain aagmon kaa yah bhaag sabase pracheen maaloom hota he
 In the texts like Bhagwati Kalpasutra, Owaiah, Thanang, Nirayavali, Shramana gives a detailed description of Lord Mahavira, his Chariya, his teachings and the erstwhile king, prince and his war, which reveals many of the endangered practices of Jain history
 nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavadasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, vivagasuy aadi granthon main mahavir dwaara kahi hui anek katha-kahaniyaan tathaa unki shishy-shishyaaon kaa varnan he, jisamen jain parampara sambandhi anek baton kaa parichay miltaa he
 Many important topics related to Vaastu Shastra, music, flora, etc
 are described in the texts like Raipanesya, Jeevabhigam, Pannavana, which is not available elsewhere
 chhedsutron main saadhuon ke aahaar-vihaar tathaa praayshchit aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisaki tulana baudhon ke vinayapitak se kii sakati he
 It is told in the Vrhatkalpasutra that when Mahavira Saket was a monk in a garden called Subhumibhaga, at that time he allowed his monks and nuns to visit the monastery in the east of Saket, up to Kaushambi of Daksai, and to Kunala in the north
 isse pataa lagata he ki armbh main jain dharm kaa prachaar simit tha, tathaa jain shraman magadh or uttar pradesh ke kuch hisson ko chhodkar anyatra nahin ja sakate the
 Of course, this part of the Holesutras is as ancient as Mahavira himself
 tatpashchaat raja kanishka ke samakaleen mathura ke jain shilalekhon main bhinn-bhinn gana, kul or shakhaon kaa ullekh he, vah bhadravahu ke kalpasutra main varnit gana, kul or shakhaon ke saath praayah mail khaataa he
 This also reveals the authenticity of Jain scriptures
 vastutah is samay tak jain parampara main shwetambar or digambar kaa bhed nahin maaloom hota
 The resemblance of Pali Tripitaka in the subject, language etc
 of Jain proceeds also reflects the antiquity of this literature
 pali-sutron kii attakathaon kii tarah aagmon kii bhi anek tikaa-tippaniyan, deepika, nivritti, vivaran, avchuri aadi likhi gayi hai
 This literature can be divided into four divisions, namely, Nirukti, Bhashya, Churni and Tika, combining Agam and it is called 'panchangi'
 aagam sahitya kii tarah yah sahitya bhi bahut mahatva kaa he
 In this, the subject of Agams is given in detail
 is sahitya main anek anushrutiyaan surakshit hai, jo aitihaasik drushti se atyant mahatvapurn hai
 There is a wide variety of archaeological material in the commentaries, such as large-scale, practical, practical, nihilakrini, essentials, essentials, Uttarayana tika, etc
, due to which India’s customs, fair festivals, monks, cults, times, floods, thieves, robbers, sartwahs, trade The routes, crafts, art, food, houses, jewelery, etc
, throw a lot of light on various subjects
 lok-katha or bhashaa shaastra kii drushti se bhi yah sahitya bahut mahatva kaa he

 spasht he ki yah naam prishthiya vaataavaran kii gatisheel sthiti kii ore sanket karata hai, kintu aajkal yah naam kuch vishesh prachlit nahin hen or iske sthaan par bhautik bhuvigyaan adhik prachlit he
 There are three main parts of this science, which are as follows: prakritik karkon dwaara prishthiya shailon kaa kshay, apradan evam anaachhadan tathaa usase utpann avsaad ityadi kaa parivahan, Accumulation of depression and sanchit avsaad kaa sangyojan or drudhibhavan The natural factors that affect the surface matter can be divided into two classes according to the condition of their playground: dharatleey or Visceral inamen dharatleey karkon kii kriyaatmak urja pradhanthya evam charmat: surya se utpann hoti hai
 In this category, various components of the atmosphere, rain etc
, visceral waters and fountain, river and glaciers, sea and lake are particularly notable
 inkaa kreedakshetra mukhyat: bhumandal kaa thal bhaag hota hai, jisamen samudri tat bhi sammilit honge
 They do not have any effect on the surface of the ocean and their penetration is relatively subtle even in the deepest parts of the surface
 aantbhom karkon kii urja kaa pradhan strot prithvi kii aantarik ushnata hi he
 In this category, planing, volcanic play, heat and earthquake etc
 occur
 spasht he ki inkaa mul kreedakshetra dharaatal ke neeche he or unase utpann prabhaav dharaatal ke upar kabhi aa jate hai or kabhi nahin aa pate
 There are four main components in the atmosphere which are working towards the earth: rain, heat change, frost and wind
 varsha ek bahut saamaanya, kintu atyant shaktimaan kaarak he
 Its method of work is somewhat chemical and some forced
 purnataya shuddh jal main rasinic kriya karne kii kshamta praaia: bilkul nahin hoti
 Although most of the rainwater is pure before reaching the earth, both atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide merge in it when coming from the sky
 oxykrut or carbonikrut varshajal kii abhikriya se prishthiya shailon ke anekanek khanij apni apni prakruti ke anusaar oxidon or carboneton main parivartit ho jate hai
 Some minerals, or many molecules, also form chemical compounds hydrate with water
 is prakaar varshaalay kii rasinic kriya dwaara shilaayein apaghatit ho jaati hai
 Newly formed substances have some solutes and some insoluble
 viley ansh banane ke saath hi jal main villin hokar bah jate hai or aviley ansh jahaan ke tahaan chhot jate hai
 The indestructible portion consists of clay molecules and sand, which accumulate over time to form different levels of soil
 kabhi kabhi aviley padaarth ko sanchit hone kaa avasar hi nahin mil paata, apitu varsha kaa jal dharaatal par behate hue use bhi purnataya athwa anshat:, apane saath bahaakar le jaataa he
 As long as the water has the power to drain the substance, it goes on flowing and when the power is depleted it sits where it is
 is prakaar varsha ke jal dwaara bahaae hue padaarth ko kehete hai
 Its volume depends on the slope of the surface and the speed of rainfall
 dhaal kii pravanta or varsha kii tivrata donon hi varsha ke jal ke bahaane kii shakti ko varddhit karti hai
 Local climate also has a great effect on the results of rainfall, if the amount of annual rainfall in the two regions is often the same, but one has light splashes and the other has occasional but very intense rainfall, So the effect of rainfall will be different in these two regions
 isi prakaar sookhe or barsaati mausamon ke ekantaranwale pradeshon main bhi varsha kaa prabhaav ekadam bhinn ho jaataa he
 Variation of heat also has an effect on the activation of rainfall
 ushnatapradhan deshon main varsha ke jal main apghaton karne kii shakti, sheetapradhan deshon kii apeksha, kahin adhik hoti hai
 Due to alternating heat and cold, the rocks are broken apart, turning into thick or fine powder
 dravya kaa yah saadhaaran gun he ki garmi ke prabhaav se failata he or sardi paane par sikudta he
 The amount of expansion and contraction depends on the material, that is, some fluid expands more and some less
 bahut si shilaayein do, teen yaa or adhik khanijon kii bani hoti hai
 Therefore, in the heat of the day, all these minerals are spread according to their own properties and in the night it gets frosty and shrinks
 kaai khanij kam failata he, kaai adhik
 The mineral that spreads more puts a type of pressure on others, causing the particles to break apart
 din prati din is prakram ke chalate rahane se prabhaav badhata jaataa he or kalantar main shailon kii upree paraten churnapraia ho jaati he
 It is obvious that the greater the difference in temperature between day and night, the greater the velocity the rocks will be separated
 is kriyaamein khanijon ke rasinic sanghatan main praaia: bilkul hi parivartan nahin hota, keval khanijon ke parsparik bandhan itane deele pad jate hai ki ve ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai
 That is why this action is called dissolution
 varsha or taapaparivartan donon kii sammilit kriya se, jo bahudhaa prakruti main hoti he, Both the decomposition and disintegration of rocks are encouraged
 tushaar kii kriya bhi keval balkrit hi hoti he
 The source of the power of this factor is the common circle that at 4 ° c the relative density of water is maximum
 isse or adhik thandha hone par ghanatv kam hone lagata he, arthath duusare shabdon main yah kahana chahie ki jal ke aaytan main vruddhi ho jaati he
 When the water is converted into ice at 0 ° C, then its volume often increases to tenth hour
 at: kritrim vidhi se barf jamaane main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana nitant aavashyak hota he ki barf ke bade hue aaytan ke liye paatr main rikt sthaan hona chahie
 In the absence of this space, the pressure of the spreading ice is expected to cause the character to burst
 isi vrut ke anusaar sheetapradhan deshon main jab shilaayein tushaar ke prabhaav main aati hai, to unke ang ang chhin bhinn ho jate hai
 Water penetrates into the pores and walls of the rocks and freezes every day when it gets cold and melts when it gets hot
 isse kuch hi kaal main chattaanon kii upree paraton ke avyav kamjor or praaia: asambaddha ho jate hai
 Later, due to the shock of rain and wind, they spontaneously crumble
 bahudhaa tushaar kaa yah prabhaav visphoti hota he
 In those parts of the winter months where the vegetation is less, open, uncultivated rocks are thus covered with broken rock blocks and large amounts of such blocks are collected in the hills of the hills, known as Shailamalba
 in khandon kaa koi nishchit aakaar nahin hota or inke kone bahudhaa nukile evam paine hote hai
 Tusshar is a very powerful factor for rock disintegration, but its area of work is only cold
 vaayu ke vishisht kreedakshetra registan or unche parvaty pradesh hai, jahaan yah bahudhaa teevr gati se bahati he
 It has the unique ability to perform forced erosion under favorable conditions
 isaki shakti kaa mukhya rahasy is baat main he ki yah anginati chote bade baaluu or mitti ke kanon ko badi teevr gati se uda le jaati he
 These particles repeatedly collide with each other while flowing in the raging wind, causing abrasion and gradually becoming smaller
 saath hi jhanjhaavat ke maarg main jo pahaad, chattaane evam pathar ke khand aa jate hai, un sabake upar bhi ye baaluu jhonka kii bhanti aghat karte hai, jisase ve sabhi apgharshit hote rahete hai
 Generally, sand is not able to rise to much higher than the ground level
 is kaaran vaayu kii apradan-kriya-kshetra kii oonchaai bhi usee anupaat se simit rah jaati he
 As a result, in the desert regions often the lower parts of the hills and rocks become thin and narrow, but the upper body is left unaffected
 is prakaar ke adhoradan se kukuramutta aadi saddash kuch vilakshan akritiyaan ban jaati hai
 In the desert regions, the direction of wind is usually the same for a long time, due to which the direction of their abrasion and erosion is also unchanged for a long time
 is kaaran registaanon main vayutpann golashm gol matol na hokar, koniya or falkeey hote hai
 In fact, for them, the word 'gholam' is inappropriate and should be used in place of the German word decanter
 vaayu main apradan ke saath saath parivahan kii bhi vilakshan shakti he
 Fine sand and dust particles are carried by the vast quantities of air from the desert regions every year and deposit in places where their velocity decreases and the grass and shrubs obstruct its path
 is prakaar se pariwahit padaarth ke nikshepon ko vaiudh baaluu or vaiudh mrittika kehete hai
 In northern China, there is a large deposition of this type of eolian clay, which is 300 to 450 meters in thickness, and which the wind has brought here from the deserts of Central Asia
 varsha dwaara laae hue jal kaa kuch bhaag vashpikaran se pun: vayumandal main chalaa jaataa he, kuch dharaatal par bahata hua nadiyon ke maarg se samudr main pahunch jaataa he or kuch prithvi main ant:sravit ho jaataa he
 The part which flows on the ground is called runoff and the surface which is endowed, is called underground or visceral water
 in teenon bhaagon kaa parsparik anupaat sthaneey jalwaayu, sthalakriti or bhoumiki par nirbhar rahata he
 The amount of evaporation prevails in regions of humid climate
 samaan jalwaayu ke pradeshon me sthalakriti kii vishmata ke saath apwaahit jal kii maatra adhik hoti jaati he
 The circle of geology is also very important, because some rocks are very fringed, but their penetration is very small, such as rock and clay
 inke atirikt ek teesri shrenee kii shilaayein na to randhri hoti or na praveshya, jese granite
 Thus, the amount of water that is injected depends on the physical characteristics of the local rocks
 dharaatal main kuch gaharaai par pahunchne par, bhoomi or shail jal se santrupt ho jate hai
 The surface of saturation is called the ground level
 is str kii gaharaai kshetravishesh kii vaaðshak varsha kii maatra, sthalakriti or sthaneey bhoumikeey sanrachana par nirbhar hoti hai
 Generally, the soil is closer to the ground in wet areas than in dry areas
 samudr, jhil, sarovar evam badi nadiyon ke samipsth bhaagon main bhi yah str apekshaakrit dharaatal ke sameep hota he
 It goes deep due to drought and comes up when there is excess rain
 aantbhaum jal prishth main kitni gaharaai tak samaa saktaa he, yah baat bhi sthaneey shailon kii sanrachana par nirbhar he
 Water enters the foliage sites and estuaries between the rocks, so the depth to which the rocks contain foramen, or fissures, is as far as collapsing in most of the fissure due to the pressure of the underground rocks
 randhravkash bhi alp ho ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the visceral water does not go to the depths and starts moving towards the earth
 antat: iskaa lakshya samudr he
 Sometimes it reaches there by underground routes and sometimes it gets such routes, from which it again reaches the ground as springs
 khule hue tathaa chaude vidaron or sandhitalon ke atirikt, anyatra aantbhaum jal kii pravaahgati saadhanya ati mand hoti he
 This is why it does not have the power to perform any type of forced action, but it can do chemical action in favorable conditions
 vidar or sandhitalon ke anuprastha aage badhate hue yah, varshajal kii hi bhanti, deevaaron ke shailon ke khanijon ko oxikrut, carbonikrut, athwa jalyojit kar detaa he or is prakaar shail kaa apghaton ho jaataa he
 In the area where limestone rocks are present, there is a large area of working the underground water
 carbonikrut jal main chuunaapatthar villin ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the water flowing from the limestone's seventies merges many parts of it into caves
 kabhi kabhi is prakar bani gufaaon kaa aakaar bada, kai sau meter tak lanbaa or 4-5 meter gaharaa ho jaataa he or inamen se bahata hua jal aantbhaum nadi bana detaa he
 Somewhere carbonated water starts dripping from the roof of the cave
 tapakate pani kii kuch bhaag vashpikrut hokar ud jaataa he or usamen viley calcium carbonate tapakanevaale sthaan par avakshepit ho jaataa he
 Frequent dripping of droplets at the same place and continuous precipitation of calcium carbonate at the same place creates a columnar amount, called stalactite
 isi prakaar kii kriya gupha ke farsh par tapake hue jal ke vashpkaran se bhi hoti he or usase bhi avakshepit carbonate se aisi stambhakar akruti banati he jo farsh se chat kii ore badhati he
 These shapes are called stalagmites
 kabhi kabhi stalegmite ek duusare kii ore badhate hue milakar gupha kii chat se farsh tak kaa satat stambh bana dete hai
 Sometimes there is no specific form of precipitated carbonate amount
 aisi avasthaa main use calk nisaad, tupha yaa travertine kehete hai
 In some caves, the amount of carbonate precipitated in this way becomes so large that such carbonate can carry on business
 upar yah ullekh kiya gaya he ki kabhi kabhi aantbhaum jal soton ke rup main pun: dharaatal par laut aata he
 This phenomenon depends on the specific configuration of local rocks
 yadi koi baluupathar kaa randhri shail, r, is prakaar vinyast ho ki uske upar or neeche purnataya athwa praaia: apargamya shail, mrittika, shell yaa anya koi usee gun kii shilaayein sthit hon, to aantbhaim jal randhri shail main risataa hua, apargamya shila ke upree sansparsh tal tak pahunchne ke baad, staron kii dhaal ke anusaar pashrvavarti disha main badhane lagegaa
 In the same direction, wherever that rock is uncovered in a natural cut, the water will start flowing in the form of springs
 bahudhaa shailon main upasthit bhranshatal bhi soton ke banane main sahaayta dete hai
 If due to a fault, the impermeable rock is displaced and located in the proximity of the stomata and permeable rock, then at the place where the erosion will be transverse to the natural cut, there will be springs falling
 soton ke pani main praaia: sadaiv khanij padaarth thodi bahut maatra main villin hote hai
 When their quantity is more than 1 per cent by weight, then it is called mineral spring
 par sarsaadhaaran vyavhaar main kisi bhi aise sote ko, jiske pani main villin khanij padaarth ke kaaran kuch vishisht swaad ho, khanij sota kehete hai
 But in normal practice, any spring, which has some specific taste due to the mineral content dissolved in the water, is called mineral spring; However, minerals like calcium carbonate are very abundant and do not give any flavor and magnesium salts start tasting even in very small amounts
 soton kaa pani bahudhaa dabaav ke adheen hota he
 There is a decrease in pressure as the water comes out and the solubility of water also decreases with it
 at: soton ke udgam sthaan par bahudhaa khanij padaarth avakshepit ho jaataa he
 The composition of this substance is usually powdery or silicic and, according to the depositional composition, is called calc nisad, or silicic acid
 kabhi kabhi louh carbonate, athwa anya lavan, yaa gandhak bhi avakshepit ho jate hai
 The water of any spring is very hot and sometimes the water is also radioactive
 bihar rajya main rajgir ke garam pani ke sote bahut prasiddh hai
 The water of these springs often comes from very deep parts of the surface
 kuch soton kaa pani aantbhaum na hokar megmiy utpatti kaa bhi hota he, arthath aisa jal jo sudur garbh main megmiy padaarth se nikle hue vaashp se yukt hota he
 Such fountain is called magmatic fountain
 kahin kahin aantbhaum jal aisi vishisht paristhiti main vidyaman hota he ki us sthaan par kuan banane se pani swat: upar chadh aata he or kahin kahin to pani kii dhar fauware kii bhanti dharaatal se kai meter tak upar uchhalati hui nikalati he
 These are called excretory follicles
 inke banane ke liye anivaary praveshya pratibandh ye hai: aantbhaum jal ek aise randhramay or apraveshya shail ke andar sanchit ho jiske upar or neeche donon ore apargamya shail avasthit hon, staron ke pravan kii disha main jal ke bahakar nikal jane kaa maarg avaruddha ho or jal kaa mul strothasthaan, kuna banane ke sthaan se itani oonchaai par ho ki vaanchhneeya taral sthitik daab utpann ho, jiske prabhaav se kuan banane par jal swat: dharaatal tak upar uth jaay
 a very remarkable condition has been found at the Neyveli site in the South Arcot district of Madras province, where huge peat deposits have been found
 vahaan utsrut jal kii daab or maatra donon hi itani adhik hai ki peet ke utkhanan main bahut kathinaayee hui he, tathaa jal ko niyantrit karne ke liye vishesh saadhan prayukt karne pade hai
 The river is very effective and functional among natural factors
 yah apradan, parivahan or nickshepan, teenon hi prakaar ke kaary atyadhik pariman main karti he
 Although the importance of the work of rainwater is of little importance, its effect and fruit appear to be more pronounced as the action of the river is concentrated in long and relatively narrow valleys
 varshajal kii bhanti hi nadi kaa jal bhi apni ghati ke tal or kinaaron ke shailon ko rasinic kriya dwaara apaghatit kar saktaa he
 The solute fraction of the decomposed material thus dissolved in the river water and the insoluble portion also flows along the ravine
 yah kriya nadi apane parvatiy pradesh ke maarg main sugamawa se karti he, kyonki vahaan ghaar itani vegvan hoti he ki praaia: sadaiv nae, anpadhtit shailon kii staren anaachhadit hoti rahati hai jisase ki ve sahaj hi kriya ke prabhaav main aati rahati hai
 But when the velocity of the torrent in the plains decreases, the valley floor is covered with soil and sand cover
 falat: anpadhtit shailon se sampark bhi kam ho jaataa he
 In areas where limestone rocks are high, chemical activity is very abundant in those areas, because in carbonated water, limestone dissolves spontaneously
 rasinic kii apeksh balkrit apradan karne kii shakti nadi main bahut adhik hoti he
 Generally pure water cannot degrade the rocks, but when sand and gravel are mixed in it, the situation changes, as they both support each other
 nadi kaa kaa jal shakti pradaan karata he or baaluu evam bajri apgharshan karte hai, jiske prabhaav se tah or kinare shanai: shanai: chote hote jate hai
 In addition, they themselves take part in desilting the rocks of the fold
 nadi kii apgharshan shakti ghaar kii tivrata par nirbhar he or dhar kii tivrata sthalakriti par aadhaarit he
 The more prone the gradient is, the sharper is also sharper accordingly
 saath hi jal kii maatra bhi dhar kii gati ko prabhavit karti he
 The speed of the blade increases with the ratio of its speed to its cube root, that is, if the volume of water becomes eightfold, the speed of the edge becomes double
 falat:, jin deshon main sookhe or barsaati mausam pruthak pruthak hote hai, vahaan nadiyon kii apradan shakti barsaat ke dinon main bahut bad jaati he
 Initially, the banks of the river are usually steep and rich, especially in hard rock areas
 kintu vayumandaleey karkon ke prabhaavavash, kinaaron ke upree bhaag shanai: shanai: apkshin hone lagate hai
 The decomposed and fragmented material produced by it carries the river
 iske falswaroop kalantar main nadi kii ghati kaa pariched j aakaar kaa ho jaataa he arthath uske donon kinare tal kii ore dhaalu ho jate hai
 The river flows from a high place to the sea, so its effort is always to cut the ground and lower it so that it becomes equal to the sea level
 is tarah nadi ke sheersh se sangam tak ke anudaidhry pariched kii pravanta sheersh kii ore sabase adhik or sangam ke sameep sabase kam hoti he
 In other words, the vertical erosion of the river is highest in the upper reaches of the valley and decreases as it moves towards the sea
 jab nadiyon kii ghati aisi sthit main pahunch jaati ki udhrvadhar kataav ek dam band ho jaay or uski ghati kaa tal samudratal ke samaan ho jaay, to vah apradan ke charam str par pahunch jaati he
 The valley in which the vertical erosion is intensely progressive is called Tarun, which has reached the peak, it is called old and its inner state is mature
 ek hi ghati ke vibhinn bhaagon main teenon avasthaaen vidyaman ho sakati hai
 If topographical changes occur in the area of an old Sarita valley due to the influence of prudential forces and the site reverberates, the river becomes rejuvenated and once again starts vertical harvesting
 saadharantaya nadi kii ghati kii pravanta kramik haati he, yadhyapi pravanta kii maatra sthaan sthaan par ghat bad sakati he
 But sometimes the diathesis also becomes obsolete and waterfalls are formed
 yah sthiti visheshkar aise pradeshon main hoti jahaan kathor or mridu shilaon kaa ekantaran hota he
 Soft water flows away easily and easily, due to which there is a large amount of engraving in the valley
 kathor str avarodhi he or jahaan kaa tahaan khadaa rah jaataa he
 The water flowing over it starts falling into the more carved part of the soft level of the valley
 is prakaar ghati kii pravanta akramik ho jaati he or jal prapaat ban jate hai
 Often, the location of these falls also gradually diverges towards the top of the river
 hota yah he ki prapaat ke sthaan par pani ke oonchaai se girane ke kaaran nadi kii dhar main teji aa jaati he, jisase uski apradan shakti or bad jaati he
 Just below the waterfall, a kind of dahl is formed, in which whirlpools begin to fall and the rapidly moving water in them starts cutting the wall of the waterfall
 is prakaar nichevala mridu str or bhi teji se katataa jaataa he or ek prakaar kaa talochhedan hone lagata hai, jisase kathor str niravlamb hokar baahar ko nikal aata he
 Over the course of the uptake, the most forward part of the stern falls apart and falls in the absence of longitudinally, and the position of the falls retracts equal to the size of the fallen shell
 yah kriya barambar hoti rahati he or prati baar prapaat kaa sthaan kramash: peeche hat jaataa he
 Due to this type of erosion, due to the breaking of hard rock, a deep blast is formed from the initial place of the fall backwards
 jabalpur ke sip narmada nadi kii sangmarmar ke shailon main utkeern ghati or bhedaghat kaa jalprapaat is ghatana kaa sundar ddashtaant he
 The fall of the world-famous Nyagara River is made in this way
 vahaan kii gai maapon se maaloom hota he ki prapaat prati varsh apane sthaan se praaia: dedh meter peeche hat jaataa he
 It is estimated that at the same speed, it will usually take 20 to 35 thousand years to build the 11 km long valley of Nyagara
 or bhi kai paristhitiyon main jalprapaat ban sakate hai, kintu mulat: har avasthaa main ghati ke vibhinn avyavon ke apradan kii gati main antar hona aavashyak he
 These falls are salient to the young state of the valley
 apradan kii charam str avasthaa main pahunchne par nadi kii shakti apane pashrvo ko kaatane main lag jaati he
 When the valley is very straight, the two sides are cut by one, but inequality arises due to slight curvature
 ghati ke avatal pashrv kii ore dhar main adhik tivrata hoti he or isaliye udhar kataav adhik maatra main hota he
 Therefore by decreasing the velocity of the torrent towards the opposite convex side, not only the erosion stops but the asymmetry is further increased by the river and the path of the river becomes more and more curved
 is prakaar visarpi mode kii utpatti hoti he
 Often the dimensions of these turns are greatly increased and the turns also become very complex
 kabhi kabhi do mode ek dusre ke itane paas aa jate he ki unke bich kii ekadam sidhi duuri, nadi ke anuprastha maarg kii duuri kaa dashamansh yaa or bhi kam hoti he
 In such a condition, sometimes the narrow cervix between two turns begins to flow through a straight path, and one or more extracorporeal turns are discarded, which is called spasm
 nadi kaa parivahan kaary, praaia: sabhi prakritik karkon kii apeksha adhik prabhavi hota he
 The rock powder, gravel, sand, and soil produced by private erosion, all of which flows down the river to the sea, along with atmospheric factors, especially the rock powder and block produced by rainwater, in the course of some time By the way, they reach the valley of the river and holding it in the ravine, they all move slowly towards the sea
 jin bade bade khandon ko nadi kii dhar uthaane main asamarth hoti he, ve tah ke anuprastha ludhakate hue chalate hai or chote kan nilambit badhate hue chale jate he
 The power of transport is dependent on the speed of the torrent
 yadi gati main vruddhi kii maatra va ho, to parivahan shakti va6 ho jaayegi
 That is, if the speed doubles, then the transport power will become 64 times
 isse spasht he ki varshaati baadh ke samay nadiyon kii parivahan shakti or saath saath vinaash shakti kii maatra bahut bhayanak ho jaati he
 Residents on the banks of big rivers like Ganga, Brahaputra etc
 are well aware of this destructive power
 nilambit baaluu or mitti ke atirikt anekanek padaarth nadiyaan apane jal main villin kar, mahadeshiy bhaagon se samudr kii ore le jaati hai
 As mentioned in the cases of rainwater and visceral water, their chemical activity is abundant, due to which soluble substances are also formed in the same proportion
 yah sabhi padaarth kalantar main nadiyon main pahunch jate hai
 The rivers themselves produce some soluble material by their action and all of them reach the sea respectively
 gananaa kar yah anumaan kiya gaya he ki ganga or brahamputra apane sammilit maarg se praaia: 1100 n 106 ghan meter mitti or baaluu prati varsh bengal kii khadi main pahunchaa detii he america kii mississippi nadi dwaara prati varsh parivahit padaarth kii maatra 200n106 ghan meter hai
 The Hwanghao River of China carries such a vast amount of soil that the sea near its mouth remains yellow for miles and it is called the Yellow Sea
 dakshini america main amejon nadi dwaara bahaai mitti or baaluu se uske muhane ke saamne samudr ke tal main jo delta saddash bhoomi ban gai hai, vah praaia: 200 kilometre lambii he
 Estimated, the amount of material transported by all the rivers of the world is estimated to be 16 cubic kilometers per year
 jaisaa purvavarti khand main bataaya gaya hai, nadi kii parivahan shakti uski dhar kii gati par nirbhar hoti he
 So as soon as his torrent is in motion, some part of his load starts depositing immediately
 nadi ke maarg main sabase pehla mahatvapurn nickshepan centre pahaad ke tal main us sthaan par hota he jahaan vah parvaty pradesh chhodkar maidan main pravesh karti he
 Very large golashyams and small big buttons, which come rolling smoothly across the valley in the valley, sit at the bottom as they enter the river plain
 is prakaar pahaado ke tal bhaag main ek nikshep ban jaataa he, jise jalopha shanku, athwa pankhaa kehete hai
 Another important speed change is near the confluence of the river
 ek to ghati kii dhaal vahaan pahonchte pahonchte yon hi bahut kam ho jaati he, duusare samudr va jhil kaa pani bhi bahaav ko roktaa he
 Often the velocity of the torrent is reduced so much that the tidal velocity is greater than the velocity of the river, which at the time of the tide, the river's edge starts flowing backward
 iskaa fal yah he ki sangam ke paas ke pradesh main nadi badi tivrata se avsaad or talachat nickshepit karne lagati he or uski apni banaai hui ghati hi bharne lagati hai
 Due to the deposition of depression, the flow of the river becomes more difficult and the river is divided into many small streams
 kalantar main is nickshepit avsaad main ek chauras maidan sa ban jaataa he, jisamen se anek choti dharaayen ati manthar gati se bahati hui samudr kii ore jaati hai
 The plain is triangular, with one vertex at the point in the river valley from where the current begins to divide and the baseline in front of it lies transverse to the coast of the sea
 is prakaar ke pradesh ko delta kehete hai
 Due to the blocking of the motion at the confluence of the river, sand is often deposited in longitudinal zodiac signs, which is called sand blast
 jalodh shanku or delta ke bich ke bhaag main nadi bahudhaa mausami baadh or utaar se prabhavit hoti rahati he
 During the flood, the river gets so much water that it cannot fit in its valley
 falat: vah donon kinaaron ke upar se hota hua kuch dur tak fail jaataa he
 The region that comes under the influence of floods in this way is called flood plain
 us bhaag main nadi kii dhar kii gati mukhya dhar kii apeksha bahut kam ho jaati he, jisase vahaan prachur maatra main mitti or baaluu nickshepit ho jaati he
 In contrast, during flood, the speed of the main stream is much higher than the speed of normal time, so erosion increases there and the river takes away the previously deposited sand and soil
 jaisaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he, nadi kii cheshtaa apni ghati ko nirantar gaharaa kar, apradan ke charamastar par pahunchaane kii hoti he
 As the depth of the valley increases, it often comes such a situation that even during the floods, it is not possible to reach the floodplain
 aisi dasha main nadi ek nayaa baadh-maidan banaati he
 Puranwala is called the flood-plains river Vedika
 bahudhaa nadi kii ghaatiyon main abhinav tal se kaaphi upar donon kinaaron par, athwa ek hi ore, is prakaar kii vedikaaye dikhaai padati he
 Somewhere, 2-3 or even more Vedicas meet on top of each other on different floors respectively
 unke adhyayan se nadi kii ghati ke vikaas kaa itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 In the higher mountainous regions and cold countries, colder rains bring water instead of water
 jin pradeshon main him-varsha us maatra main adhik ho jitna garmi ke samay main him pighalta he, ve pradesh sadaiv himachhadit rahete hai
 The height at which this happens is called the snow line
 yah oonchaai vibhinn vibhinn akshanshon or pradeshon main vibhinn hoti he, yatha himalay main isaki oonchaai praaia: 4,500 se 5,500 meter tak he, alps parvat 2,400 meter or norge main keval 1,500 meter he
 a large part of the sea is always snowed near the poles, especially at the south pole
 akaash se aate samay him rooyee ke gaalon ke samaan komal hota he
 In fact, there is abundant air in it
 jab ek badi raashi ekatrit ho jaati he, to upree staron kii daab se neeche kii staron main se hawa nikal jaati he or himakan aapas main milakar kathor barf ke rup main parivartit ho jate hai
 Due to the effect of gravity when collected over vast quantities, the amount of snow in the favorable topographic regions gradually slopes downwards and thus becomes a river, called glacier
 kalantar main nadi kii bhanti vah bhi apane liye ek ghati bana leti he
 Which she deepens more and more
 thos barf se utkeern hone ke kaaran himandi kii ghaatiyon ke kuch vishisht lakshan hote hai, jinamein se teen pramukh he: Their nits are wide and flattened, so that their upward passage is six-shaped, unki ghaatiyaan sarpil na hokar bahut dur tak ekadam sidhi chali jaati he or In place of the confluence of the main glacier and the tributary glacier, the bottom of the two valleys is rather gradual
 is kaaran sahaayak nadiyon kii ghati nilambi ghati kehalaati he
 Due to solid, glacial speed is very low
 kahin kahin to dinabhar main keval 30 centimetre hi aage badhati he
 Sometimes the velocity is also relatively high
 alaska main kuch himandiyaan ek din main praaia: dhai teen meter bad jaati he
 This speed, similarly to the speed of the river, depends on the amount of snow and the slope of the regional gradient
 himrekha ke neeche pahunchne par barf pighalane lagati he or saadhaaran nadi kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 The melting glaciers are the primary source of water of almost all the rivers coming from the Himalayas
 jin pradeshon main himrekha samudratal main praaia: baraabar hi hoti he, vahaan himandi swayan samudr main gir jaati he
 At such confluences, large amounts of ice often break away from the original river due to the pressure of the snow coming from behind and flow into the sea and flow far enough away
 in raashiyon ko plavi himshail kehete hai
 Plowy icebergs can also be formed for other reasons
 bahut thande pradeshon main kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki samudr ke paas jane par bhi himandi apana rup banaaye rahati he or tat ke sameep kii samudr tah ko bhi uttkeern kar apni ghati kaaphi dur tak aage badhaati chali jaati he
 There are many examples of valleys like this in Norway and Sweden, and they are called fyards
 nadi kii bhanti, himandi bhi chattaanon ko aparadit tathaa unase toote hue khandon kaa parivahan karti he
 But there is a great difference in the method of action of both
 jahaan nadi kii tah main anek chote-bade rode dhar ke veg se ludhakte hue aage badhate hai, himandi main unke ludhakne ke liye koi avasar nahin
 The piece that gets stuck in ice moves in the same state
 yatra tatra chattaanon ke bahut se tukade tuutakar himandi ke upar gir jate hai
 As the snowfall moves forward, these blocks also move forward as they are
 is bhinnata ke falswaroop jahaan nadi dwaara parivahit pathar kuch kaal ludhakte hue tathaa aapas main takaraate hue gol matol batiya swaroop ho jate hai, himdhar dwaara le jaye gayi khand ant tak koniya va nukile hi bane rahete hai
 Apart from this, with the help of the torrent, the river divides its transported material into separate parts on the basis of size and density, such as only thick gravel in places of sharp edge, thick sand in less sharp edge and lower and lower speed respectively
 When fine sand and clay are deposited in the valley folds alternately
 iske vipareet himandi padaarth ko isprakaar chhant nahin sakati, apitu uski lad main bade rode, maheen baaluu or mitti, vibhinn aakaaron ke khand, sab ek saath mili hue aage badhate hai
 And where glaciers begin to melt, all of them deposit together without any division
 himandi main padaarth ke parivahan kii shakti aparimit he
 Large sections of rocks can also carry snow with the same ease so that small particles
 is prakaar jahaan nadi kii ghati main maatr shail se pruthak krit badi badi rashiyaan bina chote khandon main toote hue vishesh dur tak aage nahin ja sakati, himandi kii ghati main ve nirantar aage parivahit hoti rahati he
 Where glaciers end and the snow melts, these large blocks fall
 sthaneey pradeshik shailon se inkaa koi matra sambandh nahin hota, isliye ve visthapit khand kehalaate hai
 While falling on the ground from the glacier, the first step on which they stick, they remain standing for many periods
 kabhi kabhi ye keval ek chote se kone ke bal girte hai or usee ke bal khadey rah jate hai
 In such a situation, their balance seems very stable and they are called misplaced segments
 ghati kii tah ke paas barf main phase hue khand apane nukile konon se tah kii shilaon ko kharonch daalate hai
 Depending on the pressure of the ice and the hardness of the rocks, these scratches are more or less deep
 kabhi kabhi bahut se chote chote khand paas paas hote hai
 All their rubbing creates many scratches in the same stone
 in khandon kii ragad himandi kii pravaah kii disha main hi lagati he, isliye sab kharonche ek duusare ke samaantar hoti he
 In this way, scratched rocks are called lined
 is vipareet kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota hai ki himandi main nitil ke paas fasaa hua koi shailakhand ghati kii tah kii kathor shilaon sein ragad khaataa hua aage badhata he, jisase tah se sata hua uskaa pashrv chikna or faldaar ho jaataa hai or anya pashrv purvawat koniya va nukile chhot jate he
 In this way, glaciers are formed at the initiative
 kabhi kabhi himandi kii ghati main avasthit shailon ke tile, barf ke apgharshan se kaaphi chikne ho jaate hai or unke pashviry kone jhad jate hai
 Most of the grease is in the part of the mound that is on the opposite side of the edge, as the ice grows by rubbing it forward
 jo bhagpashrv kii dasha main hota hai, vah jyon kaa tyon khudara or nukila chhut jaataa he
 This type of mound is called rash mouth
 adhikanshat: himandi chattaanon ke khandon ko apane upree tal par hi parivahit karti han
 The rocks of the valley's bricks continue to break in time due to the effect of the frost, which causes the rock and powder to fall on the glacier near its edges and in this way, the material transported on both sides of the glacier is called the lateral moraine
 himandi ke madhya bhaag ke upar aarambh main shailakhand praaia: bilkul nahin hote, kyonki vah bhaag ghati ke kinaaron se dur hota he
 But at the confluence of two snow-rivers, the morae to the right of one and to the left of the other do not meet, and from the confluence, the middle moren becomes
 ant main jahaan himandi samaapt hoti he or barf ke pighalane se jal banataa he, vahaan barf kii sataha par or bich main laayaa hua samast padaarth girakar ekatrit ho jaataa he
 It is called Agartastha Moren
 isamen starikaran kaa nitant abhaav hota he
 If the glaciers begin to move past their first boundary due to changes in climate, or for some other reason, the ice will continue to push forward the entire amount of the previously formed frontal moraine
 iske vipareet yadi himandi sheersh kii ore hatati ho, to agrantasth moren kaa ek aster peeche kii ore banataa chalaa jayega
 Despite occupying three quarters of the land, the sea is constantly trying to increase its expansion
 pratyaksht: uskaa kaaryakshetra tatasth pradesh he, jahaan vah apni prabal tarangon dwaara chattaanon ko chhin bhinn kar bhoomi ke oobad khaabadpan ko nasht karata hua mahadesh ko apni sataha ke baraabar chauras banane kaa praytn karata he
 Even in calm weather, the waves repeatedly hit the rocks and hurt them, but during the storm, their strength increases by a thousand times
 bade bade tufaanon kii lehren praaia: 14-15 meter unchi uthati hai
 Fen, gravel and small ballasts thrown by him have been seen jumping up to 40-50 meters high
 prayek lahar apni samast jalarashi ke bhaar se tat par aghat karti he or aisa prathit hota he maano prakruti bahut bade ghan se tatasth pradesh ko peet rahi ho
 Waves also indirectly help in their erratic action
 sabhi chattaanon main maheen daraaren or chote chote chhidr hote hai
 When the waves hit the rocks suddenly and loudly, the air filled in these cracks and holes does not get an opportunity to exit and where it compresses
 laharon kii vaapasi ke samay pani kaa dabaav hatane par hawa phir fail jaati he
 This action takes place so quickly that the air that is being spread suddenly cannot even find its way out and it acts as an explosive power in a way
 kriya ke baar baar duhraane se daraaron or chhidron ke chaaron ore kii chattane fatkar tuutane lagati hai or chhidr kramash: bade hote jate hai
 Sometimes it also happens that the cracks open on both the sea and the continent
 aisi avasthaa main laharon dwaara dabaav padane par daraar kii hawa teji se jameen kii ore nikal bhaagti he or laharon kii vaapasi par utani hi teji se phir daraar main ghus jaati he
 With this happening repeatedly, the fine holes become larger and progressively become tunnels, which are called fahmoid is prakaar tatasth chattaane laharon kii pahunch kii oonchaai par dhire-dhire khekhali hone lagati hai, jisase uuparavaali chattaanon kaa ablamb bhi kamjor hota jaataa he or ve bhi shanai: shanai: tuutakar girane lagatati hai
 Gravity also participates a lot in this activity
 jahaan chattaane kai prakaar kii hon, kuch kamjor or kuch kadi, vahaan laharon ko, vastut: kisi bhi prakritik abhiktrta ko apana kaary karne main adhik suvidha hoti he; kyonki jab kamjor chattan cat jaati he, tab usase samparkwaali kadi chattan kaa aadhaar bhi kamjor ho jaataa he or uski nijee kadai kaa mahatv kam ho jaataa he
 Due to the impact of the waves, due to the breaking of the rocks, the pieces of various sizes are fast rolled and hit on the rocks, which themselves also break and become small and chubby
 isse samudr kii aghat karne kii shakti or bhi bad jaati he
 Over time the pieces are converted into gravel
 uske baad lehren unhen pal bhar bhi vishram nahin lene deteen, nirantar apane saath aage peeche dhasitati phirti hai
 As a result, after some time the pieces of gravel become very fine and very spherical, sometimes so small that they do not even sit in the bottom and are left hanging in the water
 kanon ke is prakaar chota va gelematol karne kii laharon kii shakti nadi kii apeksha kahin adhik hoti he, kyonki ek to nadi kii tah main ragadwali gati keval ek hi disha main, nadi ke bahaav kii ore hoti he, duusare nadi kii ghati ke nichle bhaag main dhar ke kam ho jane par bade bade kan jyon ke tyon pade rah jate hai or is prakaar unki uttarottar chote hone kii kriya band ho jaati he
 The tides and other types of ocean currents also contribute to the work of the waves
 inkaa vishesh ullekhneey prabhaav sangam ke paas nadiyon kii sankri ghaatiyon main hota he, jahaan jowarbhate ke kaaran tej dharaayen utpann ho jaati hai, jo balui kinaaron or pani main nimagn chattaanon ko kshay karne kaa prayaas karti hai
 These streams carry soil and sand far away from the mouth of the river and all the coastline towards the sea
 laharon ke aghat kaa prabhaav pani kii sataha se upar nikali hui bhoomi tak hi simit nahin rahata, varan samudr ke chhichley bhaagon kii tah par bhi padataa he
 It is known from experience that often their power to decay to a depth of 30 meters remains functional
 sataha ke neeche laharon kaa kaary praaia: vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa badi hui ghaas ko hansiye se kaatane kaa, arthath yon samajhnaa chahie ki lehren apane aghat se samudr main duube hue shailon kii oonchaai main asamanta dur kar ek chauras sthaan banane kaa prayaas karti hai
 Measuring the depth of the sea from place to place, it is known that around the entire land, there is usually a flat plain at a depth of 30 meters
 is maidan kii samudri anaachhadan kaa maidan kehete hai
 The natural properties of the sea and lakes differ only in size
 samudr jahaan ati vishaal evam athaah jalarashi he, jhil apekshaakrit bahut chota jalashay he
 Due to this, the velocity of waves rising in the lake and the magnitude of tides is smaller than that of the sea
 falat: bhuprishth ke prati jhil kii apardi kriya praaia: samudr ke samaan hi hoti he, keval uski maatra jhil ke aakaar ke anuroop laghu ho jaati he
 In the above description, the description of various natural factors, the transport of erosive and non-sedative action and the depression arising from it, etc
 is described
 yahan yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki prayek kaarak kaa kaaryakshetra vishisht he
 He takes the undissolved and decomposed material produced by his action to the lowest place of his field of action, from where the second factor according to time and environment takes him under its influence to the lowest surface of his field
 udaahranarth, varshajal kii kriya se utpann apaghatit padaarth jal kii choti choti dhaaraon evam naaliyon dwaara nadi main pahunch jaati hai or phir nadi use samudr athwa jhil main pahunchaa detii he
 In this way, the rocks formed by the frost reach the bottom of the hill with the effect of gravity and then remain there until they are under the influence of some other factor
 himandi apni kriya se utpann avsaad ko parivahit kar apane galane ke sthaan tak le jaati he
 There his influence ceases and then he comes under the influence of the river Depression
 bhuprishth kaa sabase nichalaa sthaan samudr he
 Thus, the last point of depression resulting from erosion and decomposition of rocks is the sea
 avasthavishesh ke kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki yah padaarth maarg main kisi kisi sthaan par kuch kaal tak rukta hua aage bade; phir bhi, der saber, kabhi mand gati se, kabhi tej gati se, vah samudr kii ore yatra karata hi rahata he
 The maximum load of the depression reaching the sea is upstream
 is baat kaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki nadi main apane parivahit padaarth ko uske aakaar ke aadhaar par bajri, baaluu, mitti ityadi main vargeekrut karne kii shakti he
 Hence, most of the depression is divided into thick, medium and fine three sections, which are deposited at a greater distance from the coast respectively, that is, the particles near the same level of the coast will be larger and smaller in the farthest part
 
 kisi bhi ek sthaan par jyon jyon avsaad adhik maatra main sanchit hoga, vahaan kaa jal bhi apekshaakrit chhichhlaa hota jayega or iske falswaroop dhar kaa veg bhi kuch bad jayega
 Therefore, the entire depression will precipitate at some distance than before and the accumulated depression will become somewhat thicker at each place, like small sand on top of small pebbles and gravel, fine sand over thick and soil over fine sand
 kuch kaal ke uparaant or adhik avsaad ke sanchit hone se samast pradesh phir or chhichhlaa ho jayega or tab avsaad kaa nickshepan pun: ek ek pag or aage pahunchne lagenge
 If, for some reason, the bottom of the sea in the above deposition center is slowly slipping and the speed of sliding is equal to the speed of depression, then even after maximum depression has accumulated, the depth of the sea will eventually remain as it is and every The deposition of particles of the same size at the place will be continuous for a long time
 ek or dasha aisi bhi ho sakati he jab samudr kii tah ke khisakane kii gati avsaad ke sanchit hone kii gati se adhik ho jaay
 In that case the effect will be reversed and the ocean will become more and more deep even after depression accumulates
 falat: vibhinn aakaar ke kanon ke nickshepan kaa sthaan kramash: ek ek pag tat kii ore badhata jayega
 In the first and third positions mentioned above, there is a convergence of different sizes, and in the second case a depression of the same size accumulates in thick quantities
 adhikansh nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra varsha rituon main bahut kam hoti he
 Therefore, during the rainy season, depression is very abundant in the ocean
 bahudhaa do uttarottar varsha rituon ke bich kii avadhi main sanchit avsaad kii maatra naganya hoti he
 In such a situation, the depression accumulates intermittently and the depression in one rainy season gives an opportunity to harden and suppress before the depression of the second season
 uparishayi jal ke bhaar se avsaad ko dabane main sahaayta milti he
 As a result, the depressions in the successive rainfall seasons are not quite mixed with the earlier depressions, but accumulate in separate layers
 is kriya ko starikabhavan kehete hai
 The thickness of each layer will depend on the amount of depression that occurs in a rainy season
 ausat main yah 2 se 4 millimetre tak hoti he
 If deposition of depression persists for many years, then obviously some thicker layers will accumulate in place in thinner thin layers, and the thickness of these levels will depend on the speed of depression and the period in which depression deposition continues uninterrupted
 staron main sanchit avsaad ke kanon kii vyavastha par bahaav kii gati or disha kii sthirataa kaa prabhaav bhi padataa he
 Fine clay and fine sand particles remain suspended in water for a long time and sit in a very quiet place
 unka nickshepan bhi apekshaakrit gahare pani main hota he, jahaan dhar ekadam shithil pad jaati he
 In such a state, the system of accumulation of particles remains constant and levels become orderly and regular
 kanon ko jamane ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa he or str samudratah ke samaantar banate chale jate hai
 On the contrary, the place of accumulation of thick sand and gravel etc
 is relatively shallow
 aise sthanon main dhar kii gati bahudhaa parivartansheel hoti he, kabhi mand ho jaati he or kabhi teevr
 In the slow state, the upper part of the accumulated depression begins to flow unfamiliarly in the state of high speed and deposits again where the edge is dim
 is prakaar pun: nickshepit padaarth pehle str ke samaantar nahin hota
 Additionally, in shallow water, where these coarse particles are deposited, the direction of the torrent often changes
 yah parivartan jowarbhata or prachand pawan ityadi ke kaaran hota rahata he
 Therefore, along with the direction of edge, the direction of depressive levels also varies locally
 is prakaar chhichley pani main sanchit avsaadeey shailon ke str bahudhaa samaantar na hokar ek duusare se kone banaate hai, jinaki maap sthaan sthaan par bhinn bhinn ho sakati he
 This phenomenon is called virtual propagation
 kabhi kabhi avsaad kshetron main aisi sthiti hoti he ki jal kii tarangon kii chhap bhi avsaadeey staron main mudrit ho jaati he
 In the shallow regions, especially in the tectonic tropics, the velocity of the waves is so high that the deposited sand and soil dance to their signals and often give them a wave form
 nae avsaad ke aane se purv yadi is tarangit baaluu ko sookhkar kuch ddadh hone kaa avasar mil jaay, to yah tarang rup surakshit rah jaataa he
 Depression often gets an opportunity to dry up and become strong in the state of depression
 isi prakaar kekadon, keedon makodon tathaa anya jantuon ke padchinh bhi jowarbhatantar pradesh main sanchit avsaad main surakshit rah ja sakate hai
 Sometimes traces of rainwater drops also become safe in these depressions
 samudr main rahanevaale naanaa prakaar ke shalkadhari jantuon ke marane ke uparaant unke shalk samudratah main sanchit hone lagate hai
 These flakes are often rolled here and there due to the flow of waves, due to which they break and crumble and join the sand and mud brought by the river
 adhikansh shalk calcium carbonate ke bane hote hai or is prakaar calciummay avsaad, baaluu or mitti banati he
 Levels of pure soil, or sand, are able to accumulate only in places where shark-bearing creatures are often absent
 kabhi kabhi shalk tuutane se purv hi avsaad main dab jate hai or us avasthaa main ve jyon ke tyon surakshit ho jate hai
 In this way, safe shells are called fossils
 samudr ke gahare bhaagon main, jahaan nadi dwaara laai hui baaluu or mitti kaa avsaad nahin pahunch paata he, shalkon ke chure kaa shuddh avsaad nickshepit hota he, jisaki raashi kalantar main bahut prachur ho sakati he
 Thus sand levels accumulate in shallow waters, soil levels in relatively few deep waters, and limestone sedimentary rocks in more deep marine parts
 shushk evam ushnatapradhan deshon main jalawaashpan bahulata se hota he
 If there is a lake in these states in which the amount of burning by the rivers and rainwater is less than that of the steam that blows, then that lake starts drying up and can be completely destroyed
 nadiyon ke pani or varshavah main saadharantaya kuch na kuch lavan ghule rahete hai
 Therefore, new salt material comes in the lake daily by the rivers
 ushnata ke prabhaav se pani bhaap banakar ud jaataa he, parantu lavan peeche hi chhot jaataa he
 Therefore, the water of the lake becomes progressively more salty or saline
 kalantar main lavan itani adhik maatra main sanchit ho saktaa he ki jhil kaa jal usase santrupt ho jaae
 Excess evaporation will cause the salt to dissolve, causing the depression to become salty
 yadi lavan ke avakshepan ke samay nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra bahut kam ho, to praaia: vishuddh lavniya str avakshepit ho sakate hai
 Many lakes of Tibet are examples of this action
 vahaan varsha bahut kam hoti he, jisase jhilein uttarottar sookhti ja rahi hai or inaki tahon main lavniya str avakshepit ho rahe hai
 In Salt Ranj, Pakistan, deposits of salt and gypsum stored in the state of Khevada will be made by drying of an ancient ocean branch
 isi prakaar vibhinn prakritik abhikartaaon kii kriya se bhu-prishthiya shailon kaa kshay evam apradan nirantar ho rahaa he or usase utpann avsaad antat: samudr ke gart main sanchit hota ja rahaa he
 As the levels of depression increase, the pressure of the new material rises above the lower levels
 praaia: 300 meter mote avsaadeey staron kii daab 80 kilogram prati varg centimetre hoti he
 Therefore, when only 60 meters of mouthed levels are accumulated, the pressure at the lowest levels will often be 13 kg per square centimeter
 jalashay ke pani kii daab bhi kuch kam nahin hoti
 The pressure of water per one meter is 100 grams per square centimeter
 in sabhi daabon ke prabhaav se avsaad ke gun nikatatam aakar aapas main ek duusare se gunth jate hai
 Water escapes between them and they become dry
 jal kii patali patali jhilliyaan kanon se phir bhi chipki rah ja sakati hai or unka tanaav kanon ko paraspar judaa rakhane main sahaayta detaa he
 Generally some salts dissolve in reservoirs or underground water
 When this water flows out of the sedimentary depression, due to some different reasons some of its salts precipitated between the particles of depression, its free radicals are hardened together
 And depression transforms into hard, compact stone
 is prakaar sangyojan karanevaale lavenon main calcium carbonate, louh oxide, evam silica vishesh ullekhneey he
 Of these, silica bond is the strongest
 is prakaar bane hue pashaan kii jati avsaad ke padaarth par nirbhar hogi
 For example, a shell or shell made of sand depression, a combination of a group of buttons will form a conglomerate, etc
 yadi mitti main thodi baaluu ho, to balua shail ityadi shail banenge
 Depression in sea or other reservoirs is accumulated in levels or layers
 daab ke prabhaav se unke sampidit hone evam kisi na kisi lavan tathaa anya aadharak kii sahaayta se avsaad ke kan sanyojit ho jate hai
 Depression in this activity also remains
 avsaad se utpann hone ke kaaran inhen avsaadeey shail bhi kehete hai
 Sedimentary rock material accumulates in the bottom of the sea or other reservoirs for a long time
 kalantar main bhusanchalan aadi kisi vrut ke prabhaav se vah sagar kii tah main se upar uthakar, parvat kaa rup dhaaran kar, mahadesh kaa bhaag ban saktaa he
 This is a catastrophic change

 In this way, the substance of the earth is continuously participating in a depressive cycle
 prayek chakra ke ant main sagar or mahadeshon kaa punassanthaan hota he or inamen nae thal or jal bhaagon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Usually 4 large and 14 short cycles of this type have occurred in the entire history of the Earth

 Jaina Agamas are considered to have both distinction and impenetration in Dravya and synonyms
 parantu inke anusaar inkaa bhed vyaavhaarik he, parmarthat: donon abhinn he
 Similarly, both the harmony and the absence of the varna in the soul are inaccurate, but according to them, in practical terms the varna is in the soul and not in the spiritual form
 inhone deh or aatma ke aikya ko vyavahaarany main mana parantu nishchaynay main donon kaa bhed mana
 They consider matter as integral to power
 vaisheshik darshan main satta saamaanya ke kaaran dravya ko sat maanate hai, parantu unka kahana he ki is mat main to satta se bhinn hone ke kaaran dravya asat ho jayega
 Hence matter is the form of power and this is divine

 He has declared this divine being completely integral to the then philosophy by calling Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Buddha etc
 which probably no Jain Acharya did
 yahi inaki visheshta he jo anya jainacharyon se inhen alag karti he or inaki samanvayvaadee pravriti kaa nidarshan he
 He considered the soul to be different from the work, but integrated it with the imagination of the man of the Sankhya, but did not consider the soul as infeasible
 unke mat main aatma anaatmak parinman kaa kartta nahin he kintu parinami hone ke kaaran usko kartta bhi mana he
 Spirit, knowledge etc

 Only beings released from bondage and bondage have been called co-workers and divine divine beings

 abhigyaan shaakuntalam mahakavi kalidas kaa vishwavikhyath naatak he jiskaa anuwaad praaia: sabhi videshi bhashaaon main ho chukaa he
 It has a beautiful story of love, marriage, marriage, reprisal and reunion of King Dushyant and Shakuntala
 puranic katha main dushyant ko akashwani dwaara bodh hota he par is naatak main kavi ne mudrika dwaara iskaa bodh karaayaa he
 Its theatricality, its beautiful narratives, its poetic-aesthetic analogies, and the periodic notes used from place to place; And above all, the acoustics of the diverse episodes are so amazing that even Sanskrit dramas cannot compete with Abhigyan Shakuntal when viewed from these points of view; Then what to say about other languages! So this is the best thing here
 kalidas ne abhigyaan shaakuntal kii kathavstu moulik nahin chuni
 This story is derived from the Adiparva of the Mahaharata
 yon padmapurana main bhi shakuntla kii katha milti he or vah mahabharat kii apeksha shakuntala kii katha ke adhik nikat he
 For this reason, Winternitz has assumed that the story of Shakuntala is derived from Padmapurana

 The curse of Durvasa is not mentioned in the Mahabharata story

 Shakuntala of Mahabharata is not as well-groomed as that of Kalidasa
 vah dushyant ko vishwamitra or menka ke sambandh ke falswarup hue apane janm kii katha apane munh se hi sunaati he
 In the Mahabharata, Dushyant, enchanted by the appearance of Shakuntala, prays Gandharva marriage to Shakuntala; On which Shakuntala says that i can marry on the condition that the throne be given to my son only
 dushyant us samay to sweekaar kar letaa he or baad main apni rajdhani main lautakar jaan-boojhkar lajjawash shakuntala ko grahan nahin karata
 Kalidasa has refined the narrative thus received in unsophisticated form to his imagination
 durvasa ke shaap kii kalpana karke unhone dushyant ke charitra ko ooncha uthaaya he
 Shakuntala of Kalidasa is also an idol of nobility, beauty and compassion
 iske atirikt kalidas ne sari katha kaa nirvaah, bhaavon kaa chithran ityadi jis dhang se kiya he, vah moulik or apurv he
 Shakuntala was the wife of King Dushyant who was the mother of India's well-known king Bharata and the daughter of Maneka Apsara
 mahabharat main likhaa he ki shankutala kaa janm menka apsara ke garbh se hua tha jo ise van main chhodkar chali gai thi
 It was named Shakuntala by the Shankutas etc
 in the forest which protected it from predatory animals
 van main se ise kanv rishi uthaa laae the or apane ashram main rakhkar kanya ke samaan paalate the
 Once King Dushyant went out to hunt with some soldiers with him and roamed the ashram of Kanva Rishi
 rishi us samay vahaan upasthit nahin the; isse yuvati shakuntla ne hi raja dushyant kaa aatithy satkar kiya
 On the same occasion, the two married Prem and then Gandharva
 kuch dinon baad raja dushyant vahaan se apane rajya ko chale gaye
 When Kanva Muni came back, he was very happy to know that Shakuntala was married to Dushyant
 shakuntla us samay garbhvatee ho chuki thi
