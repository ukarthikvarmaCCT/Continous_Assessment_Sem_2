 Maharishi Garg mentions two independent Nakshatra enumerations in the Vedic period - one Kritikadi and the other Dhanishtadi
 garg vaakya he ki- teshan sarveshan nakshatrana karmsu krittika prathammachachakshate shravishthatu sankhyayaa: purva lagnanam arthath sabhi nakshatron main agnyadhan aadi karmon main krittika kii gananaa pratham kahi jaati he kintu dhanishtha kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron main pratham he
 The secret is that at the time when the Tarapanja of Kritika was in the equator, Kritikadi Nakshatra calculation started
 jab uttarayan kaa aarambh dhanishtha par hota tha dhanishthadi gananaa kaa aarambh hua
 It is written in the Taittiriya Brahmana that Mukhna va etanakshananam yatakrittika etah va orienti diyo na chyvante i
e
 kritika is the first of all the nakshatras

 vartmaan samay main raashichakr ke baarah bhaag kar janmkundali ke faladesh kii jo pranali prachlit he iskaa ullekh bhaar ke pracheen vaidic sahitya main nahin he
 But Atharva astrology has long since contained the basic elements of this method
 isamen raashichakr ke 27 nakshatron ke nau bhaag karke teen-teen nakshatron kaa ek-ek bhaag mana gaya he
 Among them, the first 'janma Nakshatra', the tenth 'karma Nakshatra' and the nineteenth 'adhan Nakshatra' are considered

 The description of the constellations falling in the east horizon as lagna nakshatra is also described in 3300 year old Vedang astrology
 jaise,- shravishthabhyo gunabhyastan pragvilagnan vinirdishend
 That is, after counting the property three, the constellations in the horizon before the close should be told
 isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki us samay 27 nakshatron main teen teen bhaag karke nakshatra chakra ke nav bhaag kiye gaye the
 The new departments of Atharva astrology harmonize with this
 europea vidwaanon kaa mat he ki nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag yaa baarah rashiyaan bharat main baahar se ai
 But in our Vedic literature, twelve parts of the constellation cycle based on the movement of the Sun and 27 parts based on the daily movement of the Moon have already been done

 Varahamihira has named his predecessors Maya Yavan, Manittattha, Satya, Vishnugupta etc
 brihajjatak ke tikaakar bhattotpal kaa mat he ki ye vishnugupt chandramaa ke mantri acharya chanakya hai

 Lower Egypt, also known as the Black Land, the Northern Nile and] the riverbed
 neeche di gai suchi purna nahin he: Upper Egypt, known as the Red Land, being of the southern Nile and the deserts
 The following list may not be complete: The First Dynasty ruled from c
3050 BC to 2890 BC
 The Second Dynasty judged from 2890 to2686 BC
 The Old Kingdom is the period in the third millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilisational complexity and achievement, spanning the period when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty 
 Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralised at Memphis
 The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline referred to by Egyptologists as the First Intermediate Period -- or, as the Egyptians called it, the "first illness
" The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was located at Memphis, where Djoser established his court
 The Old Kingdom is perhaps best known, however, for the large number of pyramids which were constructed at this time as pharaonic burial places
 For this reason, the Old Kingdom is frequently referred to as "the Age of the Pyramids"
 The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC
 The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2498 BC and included the pharaohs who had the Great Pyramids built, Khufu, Khafra and Menkaura
 The Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2498 to 2345 BC
 The Sixth Dynasty judged from 2345 to 2181 BC
 The First Intermediate Period is the period between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom
 The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II
 He had reigned for 94 years, longer than any monarch in history, and died aged 100
 The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age
 The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine
 Around 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna
 In the meantime, however, a rival line based at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable
 Around 2055 BC, a descendant of the pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs, reunited the Two Lands, founded the Eleventh Dynasty and ruled as Mentuhotep II, the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom
 The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from 2181 to 2160 BC
 The Ninth Dynasty ruled from 2160 to 2130 BC
 The Tenth Dynasty was a local group that held sway over Lower Egypt that ruled from 2130 to 2040 BC
 The Eleventh Dynasty was a local group with roots in Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 BC
 The Middle Kingdom is the period from the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period
 In addition to the Twelfth Dynasty, some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom
 The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time
 This opening of trade eventually led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom, induced by an invasion from the Hyksos
 The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is considered to be part of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt
 The Twelfth Dynasty considered from 1991 to 1802 BC, and is considered by later Egyptians to have been their greatest dynasty
 The Second Intermediate Period is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom
 It is best known as when the Hyksos made their appearance in Egypt, whose reign comprised the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties
 The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the long land of Egypt
 The provincial ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the western Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Fourteenth Dynasty
 The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV, and around 1720 BC took control of the town of Avaris 
 The Hyksos, led by Salitis, the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, overran Egypt during the reign of Dudimose I
 Around the time Memphis fell to the Hyksos, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes declared its independence and set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty
 This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia The Thirteenth Dynasty ruled from 1803 to around 1649 BC and lasted 153 or 154 Yrs according to Manetho
 This table should be contrasted with Known kings of the 13th Dynasty The position of the following kings is uncertain: The Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the eastern Delta, based at Xois, that ruled from around 1705 to around 1690 BC
 The position of the following kings is uncertain: The Turin King List provides an additional 25 names, some fragmentary, and no dates
 None are attested to elsewhere, and all are of very dubious provenance
 The Fifteenth Dynasty arose from among the Hyksos people: desert bedouins who emerged out of the Fertile Crescent to establish a short-lived governance over much of the Nile region, and ruled from 1674 to 1535 BC
 The Sixteenth Dynasty was a local native kingdom from Thebes who ruled Egypt for between 80 and 100 years, according to Kim Ryholt
 Some sources include as many as six more names - The Seventeenth Dynasty was based in Upper Egypt and ruled from 1650 to 1550 BC: The New Kingdom is the period covering the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt, from the 16th century BC to the 11th century BC, between the Second Intermediate Period, and the Third Intermediate Period
 Through military dominance abroad, the New Kingdom saw Egypt's greatest territorial extent
 It expanded far into Nubia in the south, and held wide territories in the Near East
 Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria
 Two of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism, and Ramesses II, who attempted to recover the territories in modern Israel / Palestine , Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty
 His reconquest led to the Battle of Qadesh, where he led the Egyptian armies against the army of the Hittite king Muwatalli II
 The Eighteenth Dynasty ruled from 1550 to 1295 BC: The Nineteenth Dynasty judged from 1292 to 1186 BC and includes one of the greatest pharaohs: Ramesses II the Great: The Twentieth Dynasty ruled from 1185 to 1069 BC: The Third Intermediate Period marked the end of the New Kingdom after the collapse of the Egyptian empire
 a number of dynasties of Libyan origin predicted, giving this period its alternative name of the Libyan Period
 The Twenty-first Dynasty was based at Tanis and was a relatively weak group
 Theoretically, they were rulers of all Egypt, but in practice their influence was limited to Lower Egypt
 They ruled from 1069 to 945 BC The pharaohs of the Twenty-second Dynasty were Libyans, ruling from around 945 to 720 BC: The Twenty-third Dynasty was a local group, again of Libyan origin, based at Herakleopolis and Thebes that ruled from 836 to c
735 BC: Not reckoned a dynasty as such, the Libu were yet another group of western nomads who occupied the western Delta from 805 to 732 BC
 The Twenty-fourth Dynasty was a short-lived rival dynasty located in the western Delta, with only two Pharaoh ruling from 732 to 720 BC
 The Late Period runs from 732 BC to Egypt becoming a province of Rome in 30 BC, and includes periods of rule by Nubians, Persians, and Macedonians
 Nubians invaded Egypt in 732 BC and took the throne of Egypt, establishing the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BC
 They were ultimately driven back into Nubia, where they established a kingdom at Napata, and, later, at Meroë
 The Twenty-sixth Dynasty ruled from around 672 to 525 BC
 Egypt was conquered by the Persian Empire in 525 BC and annexed by the Persians until 404 BC
 The Achaemenid shahs were acknowledged as pharaohs in this era, forming a "twenty-seventh" Dynasty: The Twenty-eighth Dynasty lasted only 6 years, from 404 to 398 BC, with one Pharaoh: The Twenty-ninth Dynasty judged from 398 to 380 BC: The Thirtieth Dynasty ruled from 380 until Egypt once more came under Persian rule in 343 BC: Egypt again came under the control of the Achaemenid Persians
 After the practice of Manetho, the Persian rulers from 343 to 332 BC are occasionally designated as the Thirty-first Dynasty: The Macedonians under Alexander the Great ushered in the Hellenistic period with his conquest of Persia and Egypt
 The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC: The second Hellenistic dynasty, the Ptolemies ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC: Cleopatra VII had an affair with Roman Dictator Julius Caesar, and Roman General Marc Antony, but it was not until after her suicide in 30 BC that Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 bc
subsequent Roman Emperors were accorded the title of Pharaoh, although exclusively while in Egypt
 One Egyptian king-list lists the Roman Emperors as Pharaohs up to and including Decius

733 The Intelligence Bureau, also known as the IB, is India's internal intelligence agency and famously the oldest intelligence agency in the world
 ise 1947 main grih mantralay ke adheen kendriya khufia beuro ke rup main punarnirmit kiya gaya
 Behind the assumption of its formation may be the fact that in 1885, Major General Charles mcgregor was appointed the Quartermaster General and Head of the Intelligence Department of the British Indian Army at Shimla

 In 1909, the Indian Political Intelligence Office was established in England in response to the growth of Indian anarchist activities, which was later called Indian Political Intelligence from 1921
 yah sarkaar dwaara sanchalit nigaraanee agency thi
 The IPI was jointly run by the India Office and the Government of India and the report was sent jointly to the Secretary of Civil and Judicial Department of the India Office and the Director of Intelligence Bureau in India and maintained close liaison with Scotland Yard and MI5 
 gopneeyata main duba, ibi kaa istemaal bharat ke andar se khufia jaankariyaan ikattha karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or saath hi saath khufia-virdohi or aatankwaad-virdohi kaaryon ko lagu karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The Intelligence Bureau consists of personnel from law enforcement agencies, mainly from the Indian Police Service Army
 However, the Director of Intelligence Bureau is always an IPS officer

 Due to the Intelligence Bureau's failure to predict the indo-china war of 1962 and later, the intelligence failure in the indo-pakistan war in 1965, it was divided in 1968 and assigned only the task of internal intelligence
 bahya khufia shakha ko nav-gathit research and anelisis wing ko saunp diya gaya
 The IB has had mixed success against terrorism

 The case was immediately referred to the Canadian High Commission and the case was called off after the Ministry of Home Affairs wrote a letter to the Foreign Ministry opposing the move

 The terms "human resource management" and "human resource" have largely been replaced by the term "personnel management", which describes the processes involved in managing people in the establishment
 saamaanya arth main HRM kaa matlab logon ko rojgaar dena, unke sansadhano kaa vikaas karnaa, upyog karnaa, unki sevaaon ko kaam or pratishtan kii aavashyaktaa ke anuroop banaaye rakhana or badale main muaavja dete rahanaa he
 Its features include: lekin ye paaramparik abhivyaktiyaan saidhantik niyambaddhata main bahut kam dekhne ko milti hai
 Employee and industrial relations have also sometimes been dubiously listed as synonyms, although these are usually referred to management and employee relations and employees' behavior in the company
 saidhantik anushaasan mukhya rup se is dharna par aadhaarit he ki karmchaaree ve vyakti hai jinke alag-alag lakshya or jaruratein hai or unke bare main trakon or filing cabinet jaise buniyadi vyapaar sansadhano kii tarah nahin sochaa janaa chahie
 a positive attitude towards employees is adopted in this field, assuming that almost all employees desire to contribute productivity to the enterprise and the main obstacles to their efforts are lack of knowledge, inadequate training and process failures
 maanav sansaadhan prabandhan kshetra main kaary karne vaale nausikhiye peshewaron ko prabandhan ke paramparaagat drushtikon kii tulana main adhik navonmeshi drushtikon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Its technologies compel managers of an enterprise to express their goals in a specific way
 vah is prakaar kiya jaye, jise karmchaariyon dwaara samajha or apanaaya ja sake or niyat kaaryon ke safaltaapurvak nishpaadan ke liye unhen aavashyak sansadhano ko uplabdh karaayaa ja sake
 In this way HRM techniques, when properly implemented, are indicative of the effectiveness of the enterprise's goals and overall operational practices
 HRM main bhi kai log pratishthanon main jokhim kam karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Synonyms such as personnel management are often used in a very limited sense, which is essential for activities such as recruitment of staff, salary and benefits of members and providing for their work-life needs

 The quest for an HRM approach is to ensure planning between the management of the employees of an establishment and the overall diplomatic direction of the company

 iske atirikt HR pratishthan ko bhi yah sabit karne main pareshaani hoti he ki kaise unki gatividhiyon or prakriyaaon se company ko kis prakaar phayda hota he
 Only in recent years have HR scholars and HR professionals focused on developing a model that can determine that HR benefits
 maanav sansaadhan prabandhan kai prakriyaaon main shaamil hai
 Also they are expected to achieve the above mentioned goal

 gatividhiyon main karmchaaree ke hit or muaavje, karmchaaree ke ricards or carmik nitiyon tak aapaki pahunch kaa prabandhan bhi shaamil he
 Generally, small businesses have to do these activities themselves as they are unable to afford full-time or short-term support
 However, they should always ensure that employees are - and remain - aware of personnel policies in line with current regulations
 yah nitiyaan aksar karmchaaree minial ke rup main rahati hai jo sabhi karmchaariyon ke paas hoti hai
 It is worth noting that some people see the difference between HRM and HRD
 aise log HRM ko HRD main yah kahkar shaamil karte hai ki HRD main pratishthan ke andar karmiyon ke vikaas, jaise kariyar vikaas, prashikshan, pratishthan kaa vikaas aadi gatividhiyon kaa vyapak dayera shaamil he

 'recruitment' is the process of finding prospective employees and motivating them to apply for vacancies in the organization
 ’’ karmchaariyon kii bhartee karnaa seviwargeey prabandh vibhaag kaa kaary he
 Such arrangements should be made to make available to the employees as per the requirement of the undertaking that sufficient number of suitable employees are available as and when required
 karmchaariyon kii bhartee suniyojit niti ke antargat hi kii jaani chahie
 The recruitment process starts with determining the demand of the employees

 In this way, separate demand letters are prepared for different tasks
 jab udyogon kaa adhik vikaas nahin hua tha tab shramikon kii bhartee kii samasya jatil nahin thi
 During the Second World War and after that when industrialization started with rapid pace, many recruitment systems developed and many new sources of recruitment were found
 pehle shramik kii bhartee ke liye keval madhyasthon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha
 But now many methods like planning offices, advertisements, field trips, business meetings, specific searches, various sources and searching of suitable person within the company are used

 The closer the selector will get to the applicant's information by approaching the context, the greater the authenticity and reliability of the information
 anukool sandarbh praapt hone kii dasha main praarthi ko niyukti-patr diya ja saktaa he

 In terms of development, linguists have assigned three levels of Aryan language in India - ancient, medieval and archaic

 After this, the development of modern Aryan languages of North India started in Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, etc
, which continues till today

 Sixth century BC of different languages with many characteristics of the above types of Sanskrit
 Can it be possible to generate in the same way? Apart from this, many such words are found in Prakrit which are lacking in Sanskrit, but they are present in Vedic language
 praakrit kii anek pravritiyon ko liye hue bahut se shabd vedon main paae jate hai, jo sanskrit vyakaran ke anukool nahin hai
 One of the views of many Western scholars on this problem is that when the Aryabhasha became prevalent in Bharatvarsha, the non-aryans could not pronounce and use it as pure as the Aryans; Therefore, according to his personal pronunciation and language style, he started speaking it and his contact also affected Aryo
 isi ke falswaroop praakrit bhashaa kii pravritiyon kaa vikaas hua
 In support of this view, it is also worth noting that since the Vedic period, the idols, etc
, which entered the Aryan language, were largely influenced by the non-aryan languages of that period
 kintu pracheen anarya bhashaaon kaa vishleshan kar yah siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa ki praakrit kii ukt visheshtaon kaa beej un anarya bhashaaon main vidyaman the
 That is why there is a dispute regarding this opinion
 doosraa mat yah he ki vedon kii bhashaa bolanewaale jatiyon main hi swayan dhvanyatmak bhed the, jinke kuch pramaan vedon main hi upasthit he anumaanath: vedon kii bhashaa us kaal kii roodhibaddh vedbhaasha ke kramvik se anumaanath: kai hajaar varsho main sanskrit bhashaa kaa vikaas hua, par visheshat: sushikshit purohit varg kii apni bhashaa thi, tathaa jisamen dharmik kaaryon me hi upyog kiya jaataa tha
 At the same time, Sanskrit as well as Prakrit developed from the lingua franca of the contemporary people of the oldest Vedic language, in which there were many differences according to the region
 is sambandh main yah bhi baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki bharat main aaryon kaa pravesh ek hi kaal main evam ek dhara main hua nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is not surprising if the origin and development of Prakrit languages is related to the language discrimination of the Aryan castes coming back and forth

 , Is found to have attained its regular stability in the earlier Magadhi Prakrit
 aadi aryabhasha me vaidic r ke sthaan par l kaa uccharan bhi mana gaya he, jaise kulu u shroatra
 As a result of the same trend, in the German language group Wolf and Greek Plutus are found in place of Vedic tree

 The names of the gods Indra and Nasya are Indar and Nasalite inscribed in them

 The name of the deity Varuna is mentioned in the form of "uruvan", in which the tendency of the voice and the tendency of the Varnavatya are clearly visible
 ye pravritiyaan praakrit ke saamaanya lakshan hai
 Idh used in Pali is of pre-sanskrit and Vedic tradition, no one has any doubt about it
 aadi aryabhasha main e tathaa o ke hrasv rup the; i or ou kaa abhaav tha; kintu ai, au jaise mishra swar prachlit the; anunasik sparshon kaa sankoch tha; teen ooshmon main keval ekmaatr s hi tha
 These phonetic features are found primarily in Shaurseni Prakrit, etc
 in lakshanon ke sadbhaav kaa samaadhaan samuchit rup se yahi maanakar kiya ja saktaa he ki praakrit bhashaaon main unka aagaman pracheenatam arya jatiyon kii boliyon se avichhinn parampara dwaara chalaa aayaa he
 In reality, considering Sanskrit or Vedic as the nature of Prakrit, there is no solution to the above symptoms
 tab praakrit ke vaiyakarnon ne sanskrit ko praakrit kii prakruti kyon kaha? iskaa kaaran un vyakaranon ke rache jane ke kaal or unke swaroop par dhyaan dene se spashtat: samaj me aa jaataa he
 Those grammars were written at a time when Sanskrit had more publicity and respect than Prakrit in scholasticism
 ve likhe bhi sanskrit bhashaa main gaye hai tathaa unka uddeshy bhi sanskrit naatakon main bhi prakritikta rakhane ke liye karnaa padataa tha or jinamein utkrisht saahitiyik rachanaayen bhi nirmit ho chuki thim
 Therefore, those grammars, by making Sanskrit ideal, gave a description of the characteristics which were in Prakrit and proved its significance by calling Sanskrit the nature of Prakrit
 tathaapi namisadhu ne apana yah mat spasht prakat kiya he ki prakruti kaa arth lok yaa janata he or jansadharan ko bhashaa hone se hi vah praakrit kahalaai
 The meaning of nature is very ancient and Kalidas has also used it in the meaning of folk
 prakriton kii is ati pracheen parampara ke prakaash main in bhashaaon ko vaidic or sanskrit kii apeksha uttarkalin va madhyayugin kehane kaa auchity bhi vichaarneey ho jaataa he
 If it has any significance, then only that these languages were used in literature only after Vedic and Sanskrit
 unka pratham baar dharmik prachaar ke liye upyog i

 And in his literary works, Sanskrit has a big influence in terms of words and style
 bhashaa jab tak boli ke rup main rahati he, usamen desh or kaal kii apeksha nirantar parivartan hote rahete hai
 According to this rule, three levels of Prakrit have been accepted relative to time - shraman mahavir or buddha ne jis bhashaa yaa bhashaaon main apane upadesh die ve praakrit ke pracheen str ke utkrisht rup rahe honge
 The language of his teachings has been called Magadhi and Ardhamagadhi respectively
 kintu vartmaan main pali kahi janevaali bhashaa ke granthon main hame magadhi kaa vah swaroop nahin miltaa jaisaa pashchaatkaaleen vaiyakarnon ne batalaaya he
 However, the form of the language found in Buddhist Tripitaka texts is accepted only in the ancient level of Prakrit

 Among the 14 commendations found on the rocks of places known as Shahbazgarhi and Mansehra in northwestern region, in addition to the touch letters, these three heaters are generally safe in their respective places
 rakaar yukt sanyukt varna bhi dikhaai dete hai
 But the use of Jn is found in place of knowledge and judgment
 is prakaar yah bhashaa vaiyakarnon kii pashachi praakrit kaa purvarup kahi ja sakati he
 These 14 testimonials reveal the ancient form of Shaurseni to that language
 uttar pradeshwarti kaalsi, jogad nachauli naamak sthanon par bhi ve hi 14 prashastiyaan utkeern hai
 In this we get an inflection of a word in place of 'L' and the subject factor of non-intransitive nouns
 tathaapi teenon ooshmon ke sthaan par sh nahin kintu s kaa astitv miltaa he
 Thus, there are no three characteristics of Magadhi Prakrit here
 atev ise magadhi kii apeksha ardhamagadhi praakrit ke teen lakshanon main se do prachur rup se praapt hote hai, kintu sakaar sambandhi teesraa lakshan nahin
 Therefore, it seems more appropriate to call it the ancient form of Ardmagadhi Prakrit than Magadhi
 ashok kii prashastiyaan unke bhashaatmak mahatv ke atirikt saahitiyik drushti se bhi mahatvapurn hai
 They contain the ideas and teachings of the policy, religion and morality of an emperor of ancient India who not only gained political authority over all parts of this vast country, and also established cultural relations outside the country from different countries to Alexandria

 In that period, so much publicity and no language is found
 isi pracheen str kii praakrit kaa prayog hamen ashwaghosh krit sariputra prakaran aadi naatakon ke uplabdh khandon main praapt hota he
 Except for the heroes and one or two other characters, all the other characters speak Prakrit, whose three forms are clearly visible

 Here, neither the initials nor the initials were converted into the conjuncts, nor did the initials get converted into the super-literal characters, nor did the initials of the soul become transformed into the heart, and neither did the statues appear in the place of dentistry
 
 ye ashwaghosh kii praakrit ke lakshan use pracheen str kii siddh kar rahe hai
 In Prakrit, the language of the character named Gorv is used instead of र
 ye lakshan use ardhamagadhi siddh kar rahe hai
 The heroines, clowns and other characters have their own places in Prakrit
 sab ooshm s ke rupamen paae jate hai tathaa kartakarak ekvachan okarant paaya jaataa he
 With this, this language can clearly be called ancient Shaurseni
 iske pashchaat praakrit bhashaaon ke jo bhed prabhed hue unka vishad varnan bharat naatyashaastra main praapt hota he
 He considered two types of recitation - Sanskrit and Prakrit; And it is said that three types of words are prevalent in Prakrit - same, different and native
 naatak main bhashaprayog kaa vivaran unhone is prakaar diya he - uttam paatr sanskrit bolen, kintu yadi ve daridr ho jaaen to praakrit bolen; shraman, tapasvi bhikshu, stri, balak, aadi ashuddh he
 However, it is so clear that he ordered the omissions of k, t, d, y and v in place of omissions, b, d etc
 Tk d, the fuzzy the car accent of Eternal; It is noted that the changes in the nature of Ksh, Krishna etc

 Therefore, the postwar notion is that Maharashtra should be used in the lyrical part of plays
 bharat ke mat se naatak main shauraseni bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaay yaa icchaanusaar kisi bhi deshbhasha kaa
 There are seven such official languages - Magadhi, Avanti, Shaurseni, Ardhamagadhi, Wahlika and Dakshinatya
 ant:poor nivaasiyon ke liye magadhi; chet, raajputr or sethon ke liye arghamagadhi; vidushakaadi ke liye praacha; nayika evam sakhiyon ke liye ardhamagaghi; vidushakaadi ke liye praacha; nayika evam sakhiyon ke liye shauraseni se aviruddh aavanti; yoddha, naagarik tathaa juaariyon ke liye dakshinatya; tathaa udichy, khas, shabar, shaq aadi jatiyon ke liye vahlika kaa prayog karen
 Apart from these, Bharat has called the inferior languages of Shabar, Aabhira, Chandal etc
 as Vibsha

 In Sanskrit plays, Prakrit is the most used and the Vichitra is found in the Mudrachikatikam of Shudraka
 pishal, kith vidwaanon aadi ke matanusaar to mrichctic kii rachana kaa uddeshy hi praakrit sambandhi naatyashaastra ke niyamon ko udaahrit karnaa prathit hota he
 According to the commentator Prithivadhar of this play, only four types of Prakrit are used in the play - Shaurseni, Avantika, Oriental and Magadhi
 prastut naatak main sutaradhar, nati, nayika vasantsena, charudatt kii brahmani stri evam shreshthi tathaa inke parichaarak paricharikaai aise 11 paatr shauraseni bolte hai
 There are only two secondary characters who speak the Avanti language

 But if the language of all these characters is analyzed, they can all be divided into two parts - Shaurseni and Maggi
 tikaakar ne swayan kaha he ki aavanti main keval rakaar va lokoktiyon kaa bahulya hota he or praacha main swaarthik kakar kaa
 In other things, he is only a brave
 shakari, chandali tathaa dhakki sab magadhi kii hi sheliyaan he
 In this way, despite the natural abundance of Namchar, there is virtually no language difference in Mritchkatik compared to Ashwaghosh's plays
 praakrit kaa swaroop kalgati se vishesh viksit ho gaya he or usamen kuch aise lakshan aa gaye hai jinke kaaran is praakrit ko pracheen str kii apeksha dwitiya str kii kaha jaataa he
 We find a description of Prakrit and his country differences at the same level in the available Prakrit grammars and his rich literature also exists
 dwitiya str kii praakrit kaa sarvapracheen vyakaran chandkrit praakrit lakshan yaa aarsh praakrit vyakaran he
 It is very brief and only 99 sutras represent Prakrit's methods
 is str kii visheshta batalaane vaale sutara dhyaan dene yogya hai
 According to Sutra 76, in the place of the first stanzas etc
 of the classes, there is a third order, viz
, Vampachi-bisaji, jata-data, krita-kadana, pratisiddha-padisiddh
 sutara 77 ke anusaar kh gh ch or bha ke sthaan main hakaar kaa aadesh jaise- mukhan -- muhan, megh: -- neho, madhav: -- maahvo, vrishabh: -- vasaho
 According to Sutra 97, the third letter of k and classes is omitted beyond the vowel, such as - Kokil: - Kohli, Bhagik: - Bhoio, Raja - Raya, Nadi - Nai
 sutara 98 ke anusaar lupt vyanjan ke pare a hone par ya hota he, jaise - kakau kaayau, nanaau naaya, rajau raaya
 The last 99th sutra states that the rest of Prakrit's system should be known through polite experiments
 inase aage ke chaar sutron main apbhransh kaa lakshan, sanyukt varna se lakaar kaa lop na hona, peshachi kaa r or n ke sthaan par l or na kaa aadesh, magadhika kaa r or s ke sthaan par l or sh kaa aadesh, tathaa shauraseni kaa t ke sthaan main vikalp se d kaa aadesh batalaaya gaya he
 Linguists are of the opinion that instead of the unacceptable characters of the second level, the beginning of the darker letters began to be pronounced
 phir inaki alpatar dhwani shesh rahi or phir sarvatha lop ho gaya, tathaa mahapraan dhvaniyon ke sthaan par keval ek shuddh ooshm dhwani h avshisht rah gai
 These trends and all the Jain Prakrit are from the Yr Shruti option specified in the said Aasha grammar
 kintu pashchaatkaaleen 16veen, 17veen shatee ke praakrit vaiyakarnon ne prakriton ke nirupan main jo bhrantiyaan utpann kii hai, unke aadhaar par kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon ne jain sahitya kii prakriton ko ukt vikalpon ke sadbhaav ke kaaran jain shauraseni tathaa jain maharashtri naamon dwaara pruthak nirdisht karnaa aavashyak samajha, yah aitihaasik drushti se vaastavik nahin he
 After this Arsha Prakrit grammar, a grammar called Prakritprakash was written, which was further increased twice
 aadi ke nau pariched vararuchi krit hai
 In these, the Prakrit method, the consonant method, the conjunctive method, the narrow, the cognate, the pronoun method, the form, the object and the imputation are represented respectively
 ant main kaha gaya he ki praakrit kaa shesh swaroop sanskrit ke samajhnaa chahie
 In this grammar, the nature of the second level Prakrit is found to be completely determined
 iske anusaar madhyavarti k g ch j t d p ya or da kaa praaia: lop hota he, evam kh gh th dh or bh ke sthaan par h aadesh
 Katyayan, Bhamah, Vasantraj, Sadanand and Rampanism are the commentaries on this ancient division of Prakrit Prakash
 aage ke 10wein or 12wein parichchhedon main kramash: pashachi kaa 14 sutron main tathaa magadhi kaa 17 sutron main nirupan kiya gaya he
 The nature of these two languages is called Shaurseni
 kintu isse purv kahin bhi shaureseni kaa naam nahin aayaa
 Therefore, presumably in the view of its doers, the representation of common nature is of the well-known shoraseni of that period
 in do parichchhedon par keval bhamah kii tikaa he or vidwaanon kaa anumaan he ki ye donon pariched unheen ke jode hue hai
 In these, the feature of the paishachi is the order of the first and second place in the middle of the word in the third and fourth characters, noun in place of n, jn in place of nya and ja and tva in place of magma, and Magadhi's word, st, k
 In place of Ksh at the place or Hke, Hage and Ahke in place of an ego in place of K, and the non-subjective factor is said to be at the end of the singular
 praakrit prakaash kaa antim 12 vaan pariched bahut peeche joda gaya prathit hota he
 There is no vaccine of Bhamha and others on this

 In it, the characteristics of Shaurseni have been told, in which the nature is said to be Sanskrit
 kintu antim 32wein sutara main pun: kaha gaya haihri sheshan maharashtri vat
 But before that the word Maharashtri has not appeared in the grammar or elsewhere in the grammar
 jaan padataa he yah pariched us samay joda gaya he jab yah dharna sudrudh ho gai ki praakrit kavy kii bhashaa maharashtri hi honi chahie
 Therefore, where Prakrit is instructed, Maharashtri should be taken for granted
 yahan jo shauraseni kaa swaroop batalaaya gaya he, usee se spasht ho jaataa he ki jo swaroop yahan saamaanya praakrit kaa batalaaya gaya he, vah shauraseni kaa hi kalanusaar viksit rup he
 For example, in Shaurseni, the place of intermediate t and TH are d and d respectively, in Prakrit there is the omission of d and th
 "bh" dhaatu kaa shauraseni main "bho" hi rahata he, ki kintu praakrit main vahaan "ho" aadesh kaha gaya he
 In Shaurseni there is a gem in the form of the impotent plural, like Jalani, Vani, there only remains of Prakrit, as in Jalaine, Vaniya Shaurseni there is the Dola, Dandi and Dana, etc
, while in Prakrit it is d
 Goes, like Dola, Stalk and Dasan etc

 It has four passages, out of which about three and a half passages give a systematic description of Prakrit and the remaining about 200 sutras have given special features of Shaurseni, Magadhi, Paisachi, Chulika Paisachi and Apabhramsa languages respectively
 in bhashaaon main se pratham teen kaa swaroop to adhik vistrut rup me vahi he jo upar batalaaya ja chukaa he
 Characteristics of Chulika Paishachi It is stated here in the four sutras that instead of the third and fourth letters, the order of the first and second is there, the word is from the option, some acharyas do not change the sound of the initials, The remaining things should be known like a vampiric

 GDP can be defined in three ways, all of which are conceptually similar
 pehla, yah ek nishchit samay avadhi main ek desh ke bheetar utpaadit sabhi antim maal or sevaao ke liye kiye gaye kul vyay ke baraabar he
 Second, it is equal to the sum of the total value added at each stage of production and subsidized tax on products by all industries within a country within a period
 teesraa, yah ek avadhi main desh main utpaadan ke dwaara utpann aay ke yoga ke baraabar he- arthath karmchaariyon kii kshatipurti kii raashi, utpaadan par kar aurasabsidi rahit aayaat or sakal parichaalan adhishesh The most common method of measuring and simply determining GDP is the expenditure or expenditure method: "sakal" kaa arth he sakal gharelu utpaada main se puunji share ke moolyahras ko ghataya nahin gaya he
 If the net investment is replaced by the gross investment in the above equation, the formula for net domestic product is obtained
 is sameekaran main upbhog or nivesh antim maal or sevaao par kiye jane vaale vyay hai
 The export-import part of the equation adjusts by subtracting the portion of expenditure not generated domestically and adding it back to the domestic sector

 Spending on new housing by a household is also included in the investment

 Purchases of financial products are classified as 'savings', not as investments
 vibhed spasht he: yadi dhan ko maal yaa sevaao main badla jaataa he, yah nivesh he ; lekin, yadi aap ek bond yaa stoke kaa ek share kharidte hai, yah hastantaran bhugtan GDP se alag kar diya jaataa he
 So stocks and bonds indirectly affect GDP
 haalaanki aise kray ko saamaanya bhashaa main nivesh hi kaha jaataa he, kul aarthik drushtikon se yah keval anubandhon kaa vinimay he or vaastavik utpaadan yaa GDP kaa hissaa nahin he
 It does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits
 C, I, g or NX ke udhaaharan : yadi aap apane hotel ke navinikaran ke liye dhan kharch karte hai, taaki adhibhog kii daron main vruddhi ho, to yah nijee nivesh he, lekin yadi aap aisa hi karne ke liye ek sangh main share kharidte hai ta yah bachat he
 The former is used when measuring GDP, not the latter
 lekin, jab sangh naveekaran par apane swayan ke kharch karata he, tab is kharch ko GDP main shaamil kiya jayega
 For example, if a hotel is a private home, then the renewal expense will be considered consumption, but if a government agency is converting the hotel into an office of civil services, the renewal expense will be considered a part of the public sector expenditure
 yadi navinikaran main videsh se ek jhumar kii kharid shaamil he, to vyay kii gananaa bhi aayaat kii vruddhi ke rup main kii jaati he, taaki NX kaa maan gir jaae or kul GDP kray ke dwaara prabhavit hota he
 If a domestic manufacturer is paid to build a chandelier for a foreign hotel, the situation will be reverse and the payment will be calculated in NX
 Again, GDP measures output through expenditure; If the chandelier generated was domestically purchased, it would have been included in the GDP figures when it was purchased by a consumer or business, but because it was exported to give the domestically generated amount It is necessary to "fix" the amount consumed domestically

 In contrast, GNP measures the value of an out put generated by the 'nationality' of a region
 GNP is baat par dhyaan detaa he ki utpaadan kaa maalik koun he
 For example, in the United States, GNP measures the value of out put produced by American companies regardless of where they are located

 For more information, see National Income and Production Measurement prati vyakti GDP ek arthvyavastha main jivan str kaa maap nahin he
 However, it is often used as an indicator of this kind, on the argument that all citizens will benefit from the increased economic output of their country
 isi prakaar, GDP prati vyakti vyaktigat aay kaa maap nahin he
 GDP can increase even if the income of most of the citizens of a country decreases or if it changes in proportion

 The key benefit of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured repeatedly, consistently and widely; Frequent means that most countries provide information on GDP on a quarterly basis, meaning that some measure of GDP is widely available for every country in the world, and the technical definitions used consistently within GDP, countries
 And are relatively stable, and therefore there is a belief that equal measurement is being done in each country
 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main GDP kaa upyog karne kaa ek mukhya nuksaan yah he ki yah kadai ke saath jivan str kaa maap nahin he
 GDP measures a specific type of economic activity in a country
 GDP kii paribhaasha ke anusaar aisa jaruri nahin he ki yah yah jivan str kaa maap kare
 For example, in an extreme example, a country that exported 100 percent of its production and did not import anything would still have a high GDP, but a very low standard of living
 GDP ke upyog ke paksh main tark nahin he ki yah jivan str kaa ek acha sanketak he, lekin iske bajaay yah he ki jivan str us sthiti main badhane kii pravriti rakhata he jab GDP prati vyakti badhata he
 This makes GDP representative rather than a direct measure of standard of living
 prati vyakti GDP ko shram utpaadakta ke ek pratinidhi ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 As workers' productivity increases, employees must compete by paying higher wages for them
 iske vipareet, yadi utpaadakta kam he, to mazdooree kam honi chahie yaa vyapaar laabh kamaane ke liye sakasham nahin honge
 There are many controversies about this use of GDP
 GDP kaa prayog arthshaastriyon ke dwaara arthvyavastha ke swasthya ke maapan ke liye vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he, kyonki isaki kismon ko saapeksh rup se tunrat pahachaanaa jaataa he
 However, its value as an indicator of standard of living is considered limited
 GDP kaa upyog kaise kiya jaataa he, isaki aalochanaon main shaamil hai: In fact, a short-term increase in income inequality can be a factor in long-term reduction in income inequality

 Any serving person wants to provide financial security to post-retirement life
 isamen uske liye karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi yani ipief yani sahaayak hote hai
 This is an involuntary saving for most employees, but in the event of retirement or untimely death or disability, they are extremely beneficial for the employee and his or her family
 is nidhi main karmchaaree ke masik vetan se kuch ansh strot par hi kaat kar jamaa kar liya jaataa he
 An amount equal to this is also deposited by the employer and there is also an interest of 8
5 percent
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi karmchaaree kii aayu 25 varsh he or uskaa tatkaaleen vetan 20 hajaar rupee he
 Then, assuming that EPF earns interest at the rate of 8
5 percent and saves 5 percent of his salary every year
 aise main yadi vah har maah apane mul vetan or mahangaai bhatte kaa 12 pratishat ipief main jamaa karaata hai or utani hi raashi uske niyokta dwaara bhi jamaa karai jaati he, to sevanivritti par usko 1
38 karod rupee kii adbhut raashi milegi
 The amount deposited in the fund is deducted monthly from the salary of the employee and is mixed with the employer's share and deposited in it

 Employees are required to contribute a fixed rate of basic pay, dearness allowance and allowances to keep

 However, in its present form, cash and transfer of EPF can be harmful at two levels
 niyam ke anusaar sevanivritti ke samay, chikitsakeey aavashyaktaa yaa do maah berozegaar rahane kii sthiti main karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi main se raashi nikaal sakate hai
 Most people withdraw the amount saved in it instead of transferring the provident fund amount to a new account two months after leaving their previous job
 nai company main unhen nayaa bhavishya nidhi khaataa mil jaataa he
 In this way, a large amount is found, which can be helpful in a lot of work, but this reduces the amount of the amount received at the time of retirement and the amount of interest on that amount till the time of retirement
 atev ipief raashi nikalwane kii jagah use nae khate main sthanantarit karana adhik upyukt hota he
 It is good for the employees that as soon as they join the new organization, the process of transferring provident fund should start

 Dhani Dharmadas has the status of an early poet of Chhattisgarhi
 kabirdaas ke baad harmadas kabirpanth ke sabase bade unnayak the
 There is a tendency to consider Saint Dharamdas as the most prominent among the disciples of Kabir, but they do not justify him as contemporary
 inke dwaara sthapit kahi janevaali 'chhattisgadhi shakha' kii kabirpanthi parampara kii talika ke anusaar inkaa aavirbhaav kaal vikram sanwat kii 17veen shatabdi ke dwitiya vaa pratham charan se pehle jaataa nahin jaan padataa jis kaaran ye kabir ke parvarti ho jate hai
 Similarly, it is proved by certain communal texts and some of their own lines as well, by showing them 'jhina Paras' in Jindarupa and becoming foreigners
 iske sivaay biharwale dariyaa sahab ke jnyanadeepak se bhi spasht he ki, dharamdas ke rup main, swayan kabir sahab ne hi do sau varsh peeche avatar dhaaran kiya tha or nayaa panth chalaaya tha
 Therefore, it is more probable that they have accepted him in the guru form after taking special inspiration from his ideals and teachings
 phir bhi kabir panth ke adhikansh anuyaayi in donon kii pratyaksh bhent main vishwaas karte hai or tadnusaar inkaa jivan vrutt bhi dete hai
 It is said that his former name was 'judavan' and he was a Kasaughan Baniya, his residence was Bandhavgarh

 isi prakaar yah prasiddh he ki inkaa dehanth puri main hua jahaan par ye kabir sahab ke saath rahe or inaki samadhi bhi yaheen nirmit hui
 The names of many texts composed by Sant Dharamdas are given and most of them are found in dialogue and q & a with Kabir Saheb, which does not completely prove his writing
 inaki kai footkar baniyon kaa ek sangrah 'dhani dharamdas kii bani' naam se prayag ke belwadier press dwaara prakashit he
 There he is seen as a virtuous devotee and his devotion and reverence towards Kabir Sahib is manifested
 kabir sahab vahaan inke ishtdev se prathit hote hai or unhen ye apane swami athwa pati tak ke rup main, aartbhaav ke saath, sweekaar karte hai
 The truth of the heart is targeted in the expressions displayed by him and his description of his inner self is also very clear and simple
 dadupathi raghavdas ne apni bhaktamaal ke antargat inke saat shishyon ke naam die hai tathaa unamem se pratham do arthath chudamani evam kulapati ko inkaa 'naati' arthath sambandhi hi batalaaya he
 Of the remaining five, Jagu, Bhagatha and Surat Gopal are, in fact, more famous in their Gurubhai form and there is no trace of Sahibdas and Dalhan
