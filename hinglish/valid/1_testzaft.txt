 The process of recycling potential waste materials into new products by recycling them into new products to reduce consumption of fresh raw materials, to reduce energy use, to reduce air pollution, and water pollution from traditional To reduce the need for waste disposal, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to unused pure product Substances used for recycling include procedures for processing into new products

 Recyclables include a variety of glass, paper, metals, plastics, clothing, and electronics

 The recyclable materials are either brought to a collection house or taken from the optimum location, then they are sorted, cleaned and recycled to produce new materials
 sahi myne main, padaarth ke punaravartan se usee saamagree kii taaja aapurti hogi, udaahranarth, istemaal main aa chukaa kagaz or adhik kagaz utpaadit karegaa, athwa istemaal main aa chukaa fom polistyrine se adhik polistyrine paidaa hoga
 However, it sometimes becomes either difficult or quite expensive, so the recycling of many products or materials involves their own reuse in return for the production of other materials

 Critics have differed over net economic and environmental benefits due to the costs incurred in the recycling process, and they suggest recycling proponents make matters worse and suffer biased prejudices of empiricism and confirmation
 visheshrup se, aalochakon kaa is maamle main tark he ki sangrahikaran evam dhulaai main lagane vaali laagat evam urja utpaadan ki prakriya main bachaai gai laagat or urja se ghat jaati or saath hi yah bhi ki punaravart ke udyog main utpann naukariyaan lakdi udyog, khadaan evam anya moulik utpaadanon se jude udyogon kii naukariyaan ko nikrusht sakjha jaati he; or samagriyon jaise ki kagaz kii lugdi aadi kaa punaravartak saamagree ke apakarshan se kuch hi baar pehle ho saktaa he jo or aage punaravartan ke liye baadhak hai
 There is controversy in each such claim by the proponents of recycling and the authenticity of the argument from both sides in this context has led to a long controversy
 maanav sabhyataa ke itihaas main punaravartan ek aam dastur rahaa he, jiske 400 isapurv se plato jaise himachati rahen hai
 In such periods when resources have been scarce, ancient archaeological studies of waste litter have shown that there was less waste in the houses - thereby proving that more litter was recycled in the absence of new ones

 Projects for conservation of resources were implemented during the war, which persisted even after the end of the war, in some countries where there was a lack of natural resource orientations, such as in Japan

 Recycling aluminum requires only 5 percent of energy for net production; Glass, paper and metals dramatically reduce but significantly reduce energy savings when recycled frozen resource stocks are used

 punaravartan kii pariyojna ko kargar banane main, vyapak rup se, punaravartaneey padaarth kii satat aapurti kathin he
 Three alternative laws are used to create such supplies: compulsory recycling collection, legal order to be stored in the container, and ban on waste
 Compulsory collection laws targeted the objectives of reflection in the cities to displace the specified percentage of the waste of the city, usually by a certain date
 tab shahar is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye uttaradaayi ho gaye
 The law of deposit in the container offered to return some amount, especially glass, plastic and metal in lieu of returning some containers
 When a product was purchased in such a container, a small additional charge was levied on its value
 agar container ko sangrah-centre par lautaa diya jaataa tha to upabhokta dwaara yah atirikt shulk waapas maang liya ja saktaa tha
 These projects were often quite successful at a rate of 80% recycling

 The third method of increasing the supply of recyclables is to ban the performance of some substances as waste, including frequently used oils, old batteries, tires, and garden waste
 pratibandhit utpaadon ke uchit nishpaadan ke liye vyavhaarya aarthik sthiti utpann karnaa hi is padyati kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 Care should be taken not to allow such a large number of reflective services to exist, or that such restrictions do not illegally create a large amber of garbage

 Four such legal methods exist: at least recycled quantity mandates, utility rates, procurement policies, classification and naming of recycled products
 kam se kam punaravartit maatra ke adhidesh tathaa upyogita kii daron ne utpaadakon ko unke prachaalan main paravartan ko shaamil karne ko sidhe baadhya kar diya

 sarkaron ne unki apni cruy, kshamta kaa prayog paravartaneey mog ko badhaane ke liye jis jariye kiya he use "prapan prabandh" niti kehete hai
 These policies have been either "rate edged", which leave a mark on a certain amount of time spent entirely in recycled products, or hypothesize a "value priority" that is large when recycled salmon are purchased

 Consumers with abundant purchasing potential can then opt for a more environmentally conscious option, prompting producers to increase the amount of recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand

 Many different systems have been implemented to collect recycled materials from a scattered series of common wastes
 ye pranaliyaan aam janata kii suvidha or sarkari aasaani evam kharch ke bich vyavsaayik pratibimb banaati hai
 The three major categories of aggregation are "waste disposal centers", repurchase centers and controlled area aggregations
 jahaan kachra giraae jate hai aise kendron main apshisht utpaadakon ko punaravartiya padaarthon ko kendriya ilaake main, yaa to sthapit yaa phir bhramyaman sangrahan stesan athwa khud punah parichaalit sanyatra tak dhokar le janaa padataa he
 These values have been taken as the easiest way of aggregation, but have to endure being ignorant and short of expected activity
 punah khride jane vaale centre punaravartaneey padaarthon kii kharid or safai ke maamle main chunki bhinn hai, atah ke nirantar aapurti evam istemaal ke liye spasht protsaahan pradaan karti he
 Substantial resources can then be sold, with the hope that it will benefit
 durbhagyavash sarkari aarthik sahaytaaen punah kharid jane vaale kendron ko upyogi laabhprad udyog banane ke liye sarkari aarthik sahaytaaen aavashyak hai, jaisaa ki united stats nesan solid vests management ke anusaar ek ton saamagree ko process karne main isaki laagat ausatan 50 america dollar ke aasapaas aati he, jise keval 30 america dollar par hi phir se bechaa ja saktaa he
 There are many systems in aggregation from restricted area, with subtle differences, especially with regard to where the recyclates are separated and cleaned
 mishrit apshisht ke ekatrikaran kii pramukh shreniyan mishrit punaravartaneey tathaa strot se hi pruthakkaran he
 The carriage that collects the waste usually picks up the waste
 is pratibimb ke ek chor par mishrit apshisht kaa ekatrikaran he, jisamen sabhi punaravartaneey padaarthon ko baaqi bache duusare kooda-karkat ke saath hi mishrit rup main hi ekatrit kiya jaataa he or tab baanchit padaarthon ke ek kendriya chhaantane vaale suvidhajanak sthaan par alag-alag kar saafe kar liya jaataa he
 As a result, a large amount of recyclable waste, especially paper, rot so much that it cannot be reprocessed, is saved, but also has its benefits; The city does not have to pay anything to collect the recyclables separately, nor does it have to teach the common people anything
 jo padaarth punaravartaneey hai unamem koi bhi parivartan lagu karnaa aasaan he kyonki chhaantane kii prakriya ek nirdhaarit kendriya sthal par hi hoti he
 In a mixed or single-stream system, all the recyclable materials collected are mixed together but kept separate from the other waste
 isse ekatrikaran ke uparant pariskrit kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa kaaphi kam to ho jaati he kintu aam logon ko yah sikhaane kii zarurat pad jaati he ki koun-koun se padaarth punaravartaneey he
 The second method is to separate it from the source, in which each substance is cleaned separately and cleaned before aggregation
 is padyati main ekatrikaran ke pashchaat sabase kam chhaantan kii zarurat padati he tathaa uttam punaravartaneey padaarthon kii utpatti hoti he, lekin prayek alag-alag chhante gaye padaarth ke ekatrikaran ke liye atirikt parichaalan laagat aati he
 It also requires a project to train people, which must be successful if it is necessary to avoid adulteration in recyclable material
 strot se hi chhaantan kii padyati ko sarvaadhik praathamikta pradaan kii gai he kyonki mishrit ekatrikaran main alag karne main kaaphi laagat aati he
 Due to developments in sorting and separation techniques, however, there has been a significant decline - in many areas where the source separation hypothesis has been developed, mixed aggregation has turned
 ek baar jab mishrit paravartaneey padaarth ekatrit kar liye jate hai or kendriya ekatrikaran suvidha ko supurd kar die jate hai tab vibhinn prakaar ke padaarthon ko avashya hi alag-alag chhaant lenaa chahie
 This is done in a series of levels, including a number of automated processes such as a truck loaded with material can be sorted in less than an hour
 kuch sanyatra aise hai jo padaarthon ko swachaalit tareeke se alag-alag chhaant sakate hai, jinhen ekal-padyati kaa punaravartan kaha ja saktaa he
 a 30 percent increase in recycling rates has been seen in areas where these plants exist

 The cartons are separated from the mixed paper and the most common types of plastic, PET and HDPE, are collected
 yah chantai aamtaur par, haath se hi kii jaati he, lekin kuch chantai kendron main ab yah swachaalit ho gai he: aatmsaat tarangadairya ke aadhaar par specteroscopy scinar yantra ke jariye vibhinn prakaar ke kagaz or plastic alag-alag kar liye jate hai or saath hi saath prayek padaarth ko tadnusaar alag-alag dishaao main ekatrikaran ke sahi channelon main bhej diya jaataa he

 There are some differences in whether reflection is economically effective or not
 nagarpalikaayen punaravartan kii pariyojna ko lagu karne main aksar rajkoshiya laabh dekhati hai, vyapak rup se jameen kii bharaai main kram laagat aane ke kaaran
 technical uniwarsity of denmark ke dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki 83% maamalon main gharelu kooday-kacharon ko nipataane ke liye punaravartan hi sabase adhik prabhavi padyati he
 However, based on an assessment conducted by the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute in the year 2004, it was concluded that incineration is the most efficient way of disposing of potable substances, even aluminum
 rajkoshiya kshamta aarthik kshamta se sarvatha alag he
 The language of economists of economic analysis of reflection includes multimodality or externality, a cost not calculated for the benefit of individuals outside of private transactions
 udaahranon main shaamil hai: ghatata hua vaayu-pradooshan tathaa jalaakar bhasmeekaran kii prakriya se green house gaison kaa utsarjan jameen kii bharaai se jokhimi apshisht kaa vikshalan, urja kii ghatati khapat, ghatata hua apshisht evam sansadhano kii khapat, jo antat khanan evam lakdi ke kriyalap kii paryaavarniya kshati main kami laati he

 Without mechanisms such as taxes and financial aid to internalize the outflow, businesses will ignore them despite the costs imposed on society
 aise gaiyr vittiya laabhon ko aarthik drushti se praasangik banane ke liye, samarthan karne vaale adhivattaaon ne vidyai kaarywai par jor daalane ko kaha he taaki punaravarti padaarthon kii maang main vruddhi ho
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency has concluded in favor of recycling, stating that recycling efforts have reduced the country's carbon emissions by up to a net of 49 million metric tons in 2005
 united kingdom main, apshisht or sansaadhan kaary pariyojna ke kathanusaar great britain ke punaravartan prayaason ne carbon dioxide ke utsarjan ko prativarsh 10 se 15 million ton tak kam kar diya he
 Recycling is more effective in densely populated areas, as the economic system is based on scale
 punaravartan ko aarthik rup se vyavhaarya or paryaavaran kii drushti se karigar banane ke liye kuch nishchit aavashyaktaaon kii poorti avashya kii jaani chahie
 These include an adequate source of recyclables, a system of extracting recyclables from the waste line, a factory location nearby capable of reprocessing recyclables, and a potential demand for recycled products
 in antim do aavashyaktaaon kii aksar andekhi kar di jaati he - sangrahit padaarthon ko utpaadan ke upyog main lase vaale audyogic bazaar ke bina evam utpaadit maal ke liye upabhokta bazaar ke bina, punaravartan adhuraa he or vastav main keval "ekatrikaran" he
 Many economists are in favor of government intervention at the media level to provide repeatable services
 is maansikta vaale arthshaastriyon kii sambhavit drushti main utpaada niptaan utpaadan kaa bahripan he or saath hi saath main unka tark he ki aisi duvidha vaali sankatpurna sthiti ko samaapt karne main sarvaadhik sakasham he
 However, for such a laissez faire approach to municipal recycling, see product performance as a service that consumers evaluate
 ek mukt bazaar kii drushtimangi upabhoktaaon kii praathamikta ke saath adhik mail khaati he chunki sarkaar kii tulana main labharjan talashne vaale vyavsaay gunvattta sampann utpaadon ke utpaadan yaa seva par adhik bal dete hai
 Furthermore, economists always advise against government intrusion with little or no outwardness in any market
 kuch desh asansaadhit paravartaneey padaarthon kaa vyavsaay karte hai
 Some have complained that the final future of recycled materials sold to other countries is unknown and that their final destiny is the filling of the land in return for reprocessing
 ek report ke anusaar, america main, 50-80% computers jinaki niyati punaravartit hone main he ve vastav main punaravartit hote hi nahin
 There are also reports of illegal waste imports for China, where they are recycled by completely isolating equipment for monetary gain, without considering the health or environmental damage of workers
 Although the Chinese government has banned these practices, it has not been able to completely eradicate them

 isamen ekal dhara kii prakriya kaam main laai jaati he jcimen sabhi saamaanon ko swachaalit tareeke se chhaant kar alag-alag kar liya jaataa he
 Much of the difficulty with recycling lies in the fact that most products are not designed with recycling in mind
 The design concept, which is always available, aims to solve this problem and is first mentioned in a book, "cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things" by building craftsman William mcdonough and cyanist Michael Browngart
 unken paramarshanusaar prayek utpaada ko paripurna "band-loop" prayek ansh ke liye laga hona chahie yah ek aisa taraka he jisamen prayek ang yaa to jaivik ksharan athwa anishchit rup se punaravartit prakritik paryaavarniya pranali main laut jayega
 As with the economics of the environment, care must be taken from the point of view of costs and benefits
 udhaaharan ke liye, khaadya padaarthon kii packaging ke liye gatte ko plastic kii tulana main aasaani se punaravartit kar diya ja saktaa he, lekin ise ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par bhejne main vajani ho jaataa he or nast hokar adhik kachra paidaa kar saktaa he
 These are several points of reference used in recycling for review
 is bare main vivaad he ki punaravartan ke madhyam se kitni urja bachaai ja sakati he
 According to the Energy Information Administration's own website, "A mill of paper uses 40 percent less energy to make than recycled paper than the energy it takes to make paper from a relatively new paper pulp"
 Critics often argue that the entire process consumes more energy in the production of recycled products than in the method of dumping them as waste in conventional ground fillings
 Aggregation of recyclables from the edge of dustbins has led to this argument, which according to critics is often picked up from the sidewalks by other trucks
 punaravartan ke prastaavkon kaa maananaa he ki duusari lakdi kii athwa bade-bade kundon ko dhone vaale trek ko hataa diya jaataa he jab punaravartan ke liye kagaz ko ekatrit kiya jaataa he
 Determining the right amount of production in the process of energy consumption or waste generation is difficult
 punaravartan main kitni urja kaa istemaal hua yah vyapak rup se punaravartit padaarthon ke prakaar par tathaa aisa karne ke liye istemaal main laai gayi prakriya par nirbhar karata he
 Generally everyone agrees that aluminum recycling consumes less energy than energy consumption in the production of aluminum
 EPA ke vaktavyanusaar "udahaaran ke liye aluminium ke paatro ke punaravartan se 95 pratishat urja kii bachat hoti he jo itane hi pariman main apane prakritik strot boxite se aluminium ke utpaadan main lagati he
 Economist Steven Landsberg has suggested that the only benefit ever in the filling of vacant land is the need for energy and the resulting pollution in the recycling process
 haalanki dusron ne to phir bhi jivan-chakra ke madhyam se gananaa karte hue yah akalan kiya he, ki punaravartit kagaaj ke utpaadan main khetibari fasal kii kataai-bunai, lugdi banaai, prasanskaran tathaa mularoop se maujuuda pedo aadi kii parivahan main dhulaai kii tulana main kam urja or jal kaa vyavhaar kam kiya jaataa he
 Using less recycled paper, the creation and maintenance of farming forests requires additional energy until these forests are self-sufficient and self-sustaining like naturally developed forests
 krishi anya jangalon ke srijan or rakh-rakhaav main atirikt urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, janata kii niti ke vishleshak james ve, delong ne ishaara kiya he ki punaravartan nirmaan kii ek prakriya he or kai paddatiyon main to jitna bachaate hai usase kahin adhik urja kaa istemaal hota he
 In addition to the use of energy, they have noted that recycling requires capital and labor whenever producing something from waste
 in prakriyaaon ko moulik kachche padaarth tathaa / athwa punaravartan ke liye paaramparik kacharon ke niptaan main adhik unnat sakasham or kargar padyati kii zarurat he
 The amount of money that is actually saved from recycling depends on the efficiency of the program used in the recycling

 Tierney also referred to a study conducted by the Solid Waste Association of North America which found in a study conducted among people from six communities that, in addition to planning a recycling run around nooks or dustbins, all and all of the waste Increased the cost of making operations and waste disposal
 tyrni is baat kii ore sanket dete hai ki "ki kati-chanti saamagree ke liye bhugtan kii gai keemten punaravartaneey ke rup main apane paryaavarniya mulya ke liye upaay swaroop hai
 Cutting aluminum leads to higher prices as the recycling of new aluminum in the recycling process comes at a much lower cost than the energy consumed in menu manufacturing

 The proponents of recycling oppose it, saying that it produces even worse work in gathering and sourcing raw materials of the same quantity
 lakdi kii kataai tathaa ayask kaa khanan kagaz ke punaravartan evam dhaatu ke punaravartan se adhik khatarnaak hai
 Economist Steven Landsberg has claimed that paper recycling reduces tree populations
 unhone tark diya hai ki kagaz kii companiyon ko unke apane jangalon ko phir se pedo se bhi dene ke liye protsaahan rashiyaan pradaan kii jaati hai
 Because of the huge demand for paper, small "agriculturalist" forests are needed to supply the low demand for large forests
 ansi hi tark da free market ke ek lekh main san 1995 main abhivyakt kiye gaye
 When the forest maintenance companies cut down and cut down the trees, more trees were planted in those places
 adhikansh kagaz lugdi ke jangalon se aate hai jo kagaz ke utpaadan ke liye khaastaur se lagaae gaye hai
 Many environmentalists point out that, in many ways, agrarian forests are naturally lower than natural-born forests

 In addition, the new trees that are planted are not as large as the trees that were cut down and the argument that more "more trees" will be planted does not force the forest's supporters to agree when they plant new ones Counted plants
 kaagaj kii punaravartan ko ushnkaribandheey jangal kii raksha ke saath bhramit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Many people have the misconception that deforestation of tropical years is being done due to paper making but hardly any tropical forest is being cultivated for paper

 In some rich and many less affluent countries of the world, the traditional profession of recycling is carried out by poor entrepreneurs such as karung guni, jabelin, litter and bone gatherers, waste pickers and scrapers
 Due to the birth of large-scale recycling establishments that can be profitable on the law or order scale, the poor are more likely to be thrown out of the market for recycling and reproduction
 garibon ke aay main hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye, kisi socity ko garibon ke sahaytarth atirikt saamaajik kaaryakramon kii sristi karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Like a broken window policy, it has a net loss for the poor and possibly the entire society in making recycling profitable in an artificially legitimate manner

 garibon ke dwaara punaravartan ke viruddh ho saktaa he unke punaravartanaki dakshata kuch samagriyon ke liye vastav main unchi ho kyonki 'apshisht' samajhi jane vaali samagriyon par vyakti vishesh kaa niyantran adhik hota he

 Local government often considers recycling activities of the poor as property damage compensation
 sansar main punaravartit fibre se akhabaari kagaz ke nim utpaadan kii pratishat kii ucchtam seemaa he
 The nature of recycling itself has set the most obvious upper limit
 kuch aise fibre hai jo lugdi banane ke kaarkaane main lugdi banane kii prakriya main hi nast ho jate hai, kaaran prakriya main nihit aakshamata hoi he
 According to the United Kingdom chapter's website of Friends of the Earth, only wood fiber can normally be recycled five times due to its experience with fiber damage
 is prakaar, jabatak akhabaari kagaz ki maatra vishvabhar main vyavahht hoti he utani kho die gaye fibre kii maatra ko pratibandhit karne main asweekaar karti he, nae fibre kii nishchit maatra kii vishvabhar main prativarsh zarurat padati he, haalanki yah bhi ho saktaa he ki kuch akhabaari kagaz ke kaarkaane shat-pratishat punaravartit fibre kaa hi upyog jari rakhen
 In addition, some old newspapers are never sent to recycling plants, because they are used for various types of domestic and industrial applications or simply by filling up the ground

 The American Forest and Paper Association estimates that more than 72% of news paper produced in North America in 2006 was reused for use or delivered for export, with 58% of paper mills for reuse or Shipped to the paper board factory, 16% was used in pulp mills and the remaining quantity was shipped by sea to other countries
 uttari america kii kagaz milon athwa paper board kii milon dwaara punavywahht kaa pratishat AFPA ke anumaan se lagbhag ek tritiyansh akhabaari kagaz ke manufacchyar ke liye waapas jaataa he
 The rate of recycling also varies with the price given by the market for old newspapers over time which can be quite volatile
 udhaaharan ke liye, haal-philhal ke varshon main china ke vibhinn prakaar ke kagaz or packaging ke utpaadan ke rup main ubharne ke saath-saath ullekhneey maatra main punaravartit fibre ko sanyukt rajya athwa anya kahin se bhi aaayaatit kar - puraane akhabaari kaagazon kii isaki maang ek samay kaaphi upar uth gai jisane vishvabhar main punaravartit fibre kii keemton par kaaphi asar daalaa
 Although the high prices of recycled fiber are good news towards the goal of reducing the amount of landfill, they could affect the profits of paper-mills using recycled fiber

 However, operators of such mills must be fairly selective about the purity of the waste, ensuring that they are employing at least the minimum adulteration and incorporating as long newsprint as possible
 vishuddh akhabaari kagaz lambey fibre vaale pedo jaise ki dawaadaaru, mokha or chid se banate hai, jabaki kuch kagaz or paper board ke utpaada chote fibre vaali sakht lakadiyon se utpaadit hote hai
 Newsprint printing mills prefer old newspapers, or a mixture of old newspapers and old magazines, not second grade paper recycling
 jaisaa ki sanyukt rajya america kii nagarpalikaon ne haal hi main "ekal stream" ke punaravartan kii ore kadam badhaayaa hai - anek prakaar apshisht utpaadon ko ek vaahan ke ek dabbe main ekatrit karte hue - milon ko baadhya kar diya gaya he ki ve svachh, uchit apshisht kii dhara ko hi lugdi banane ke uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye adhik raashi kharch karen
 In a 1996 New York Times article, John Tierney claimed that the government issued a mandate that recycling costs more than saving
 lekh ke vishisht ansh is prakaar hai: Tierney's article received reference advice from the Environmental Protection Fund, stating that "this article relies entirely on quotes and information from a class of anxious people and advisers who have strong ideological objections to reflection

 "jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies at Cato Institute, wrote in a 2002 article for The Heartland Institute," if the cost comes to x to deliver new produced plastics to the market, for example, but then It will cost 10X to distribute the used plastic in the market, from this we can conclude that for recycling recycled plastic The resources needed are ten times more scarce than the resources required to make plastics from broken pieces, and because recycling is considered as conserving resources, issuing a mandate for recycling in those circumstances would be good

 The history of the game of cricket exists from the 16th century to the present day, with international matches played after 1844, although international Test cricket officially began in 1877
 is samay se yah khel mul rup se england main viksit hua jo ki ab peshewar rup main adhikansh raashtra mandal deshon main khelaa jaataa he
 It is known that cricket began in the 21st century, based on circumstantial evidence that the game was started by children living in the Weald, during Saxon or Norman, in the dense forests of the south-east of England, in Kent
 And is engaged to Sussex

 Cricket existed as a children's game for many centuries, before it was introduced by adults around the beginning of the 17th century
 yah mumkin he ki cricket baccho ke dwaara hi dhund niklaa gaya or kai pidiyon tak baccho ke aavashyak khel ke rup main vidyaman rahaa
 The involvement of adults is unknown prior to the 17th century
 sambhawatah cricket lakdi ke gend se utpann hua tha, jo ki ek puraane khel, ballebaaj dwaara gend ko roak kar jor se maar kar apane lakshya tak pahunchne ke liye kiya gaya
 It was played on the sheep pasture or on its banks, in the form of a ball of sheep's fleece; Stick or seedling or other agricultural implements in the form of bats and stools or tree stumps etc
 were the basic tools of this game
 kai shabdon ko cricket pad ke sambhavit shrot mana jaataa he cricket he, jise balle yaa wicket kaa ullekh kar sakate hai
 Older in French, the word criquet is a type of club that probably gave its name croquet
 kuch log cricket or croquet ko ek hi mul kaa maanate he
 In Flemish, krick means a stick and in Old English it means cricc or cryce, crutch or staff
 vaikalpik rup se, jahiraa taurapar french bhashaa main criquet isi Flemish shabd se aayaa he krickstoelhe, jiskaa matlab ek chota or lanbaa stool he jis par carch main ghutane tekte hai
 It looks like a long nichty wicket with two stamps or a stoolball of a preceding stool
 stool shabd pracheen bolchaal main ped ke wicket ke liye prayog hota tha parantu pracheen samay main stool bal milking-stool kaa prayog wicket ke rup main istemaal kiya gaya he
 Stoolball is an ancient sport similar to cricket, still played in the southern counties of England, especially Sussex, rounders and baseball
 Valid as a precursor to cricket

 It is generally known that by the middle of the 17th century, "village cricket" had developed
 lekin county cricket kaa prarambh hua tha na hi is khel main nivesh kiya tha
 After the Civil War ended in 1648, the new Puritan government controlled "illegal assemblies", especially over-inflated football
 Games such as their laws demanded to be followed more rigorously than previously required

 Cricket certainly developed in 1660 after the re-creation and is believed to have attracted the first big bet gamblers
 The "natural" parliament passed a gambling act in 1664 that limited bets to £ 100 and by the end of the 17th century cricket had certainly become an important gambling sport

 The earliest mentors of mentions were the elite and merchant groups in 1725

 Noninvasive reactions, hypergamoglobulinemia, or antigenically generated antibodies to other infectious factors similar to HIV may have false positive results
 aatoimmune rog, jaise systemic lupas arithimetus ke kaaran bhi viral rup se mithyaa sakaaratmak nattejey aa sakate hai
 Most false negative results are due to window duration; Other factors such as post-infection prevention can sometimes lead to false negative results

 In the window period, an infected person can spread HIV to others, although antibody testing does not reveal their HIV infection
 Anti-retroviral treatment in the window period may delay the development of antibodies and the window duration may extend beyond 12 months
 aisa un rogiyon main nahin hota he jinka sankramit hone ke baad rokthaamak upachaar kiya gaya ho

 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or enzyme immunoassay was the first commonly used test for HIV, a highly sensitive test
 elisa pareekshan main vyakti ke serum ko 400 guna tanu kiya jaataa he or ek aisi plate par lagaaya jaataa he, jis par echivi antigen lage hote hai
 If antibodies to HIV are present in the serum, they may bind to these HIV antigens
 is plate ko phir serum ke anya sabhi anshon ko hataane ke liye dho liya jaataa he
 a specially made secondary antibody - an antibody that binds to human antibodies - is then applied to the plate and then washed again
 yah dwitiyak antibody pehle se ek anzime se rasaynic rup se bandhit hoti he
 In this way the plate contains an enzyme in proportion to the amount of secondary antibody bound to it
 anzime ke liye ek sabstrate lagaaya jaataa he or anzime ke utpreran se rang yaa pratidipti main parivartan ho jaataa he
 ELISA results are presented as a number; The most controversial aspect of this test is determining the point of difference between a positive and negative result

 But in comparison to the ELISA method, the proteins of the virus are first isolated and immobilized
 parvarti kadamon main serum kii atebadiyon kaa vishisht echivi proteinon se bandhan hota dekha jaataa he
 Typically hiv-infected cells are opened and the proteins within them are placed on a strip of gel over which an electric current flows

 Antibodies that are not bound are washed off and enzyme-linked antibodies, which have the ability to bind to the person's antibodies, determine which anti-hiv proteins are in the person's serum

 If the virus bands are not detected, the test is negative

 Three-gene-product access to the interpretation of Western blot has not been included in public health or medical practice

 Nearly all hiv-infected individuals with indeterminate Western blot may receive positive results after one month of testing - with six consecutive months of uncertain results, it is understood that the results are not due to HIV infection

 These tests should be used in the appropriate multi-test algorithm developed for rapid HIV test results
 yadi echivi ke prati koi antibody nahin pai gai to iskaa yah arth nahin he ki vah vyakti echivi se sankramit nahin he
 Antibody response reaches detectable levels several months after becoming infected with HIV, so rapid tests for HIV antibodies during that period do not indicate the actual infection status

 The authors concluded that: 


the use of repeatedly reactive enzyme immunoassay followed by confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescent assay remains the standard method for diagnosing HIV-1 infection
 a large study of HIV testing in 752 U
S
 laboratories reported a sensitivity of 99
7% and specificity of 98
5% for enzyme immunoassay, and studies in U
S
 blood donors reported specificities of 99
8% and greater than 99
99%
 With confirmatory Western blot, the chance of a false-positive identification in a low-prevalence setting is about 1 in 250 000 
 The specificity rates reported here for cheap enzyme immunoassay screening tests indicate that about 15 out of 1000 positive HIV test results will be false positives
 pareekshan ke parinaam kii pushti se mithyaa sakaaraatmakataa kii sambhaavna antat 250,000 pareekshanon main 1 tak kam ho sakati he
 Similarly, the rate of susceptibility indicates that 3 out of 1000 negative HIV results will actually be false negative results

 Because of the very high predictive value of these tests, the CDC recommends that the negative test result be considered conclusive evidence that the person is not infected with HIV
 vaastavik sankhyaayein parakshit janasamudaay ke anusaar bhinn ho sakati hai
 This is because the interpretation of any medical test initially depends on the status of the belief or the probability of the disease occurring or not
 saamanytah purv sambhaavna kaa anumaan pareekshan ke sthaan par yaa janasamudaay main rog kii ghatana kii jaankaree kaa prayog karke lagaaya jaataa he
 Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of all tests, including HIV tests, are done taking into consideration the prior probability of the disease and the accuracy of the method of testing, thereby establishing a new level of confidence as to whether a person has the disease or not
 
 As the rate of HIV infection in the population increases, the likelihood that a positive test accurately indicates HIV infection increases
 isi tarah se nakaaratmak anumaanit mulya echivi ghatana ke badhane ke saath ghat jaataa he
 In this way, positive tests in a high-risk community, such as those in very low-risk communities, such as those who often have unprotected anal-intercourse with unknown partners, are more likely to accurately represent HIV infection than in low-risk communities

 The p24 antigen test detects the presence of the p24 protein of HIV, which is the capsid protein of the virus
 pi24 protein ke liye vishisht monochlonal antibadiyaan rogi ke rakt main mishrit ho jaati hai
 Any p24 protein present in the patient's blood clings to the monoclonal antibodies and changes in color when the p24 sample is present in the enzyme-attached antibodies stick to the monoclonal antibodies of p24
