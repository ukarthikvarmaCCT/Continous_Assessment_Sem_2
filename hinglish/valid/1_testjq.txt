isi tarah, chunki ladkaa ishwar kaa varnan ek safed dadhi vaale ishwar ke rup main karata he or agar ladke ke pramaan par vishwaas kiya jaae to godot kii dadhi bhi safed he jisase kai log ishwar or godot ko ek rup main dekhte hai or ek samaan samajhate hai
 Vladimir's "christ has shown kindness to us!" Can be considered as proof that it is at least what he believes
 yah sab padhane se pehle ank ke aarambhik drishyon ko adhik bal miltaa he jab estrogan vladimir se poochta he ki usne godot se kya anurodh kiya he: Vladimir: Oh 


 nothing special
 estrogan: koi prarthana
 Vladimir: To some extent
 estrogan: ek aspasht vinati
 Vladimir: Perfect
 naatak ke adhikansh hisse kaa sambandh dharm ke vishay se he jo kaaphi had tak likhit sanket se otprot he
 The entire drama takes place atop a hill which some people may call heaven, which serves the purpose of being a religious parable
 anthoni chronin ke anusaar, " ke paas hameshaa ek bible hota tha, naatak ke ant main uske paas ek se adhik sanskaran the or bible kii shabdanukramanika hameshaa uski aalmaari main rakhe sandarbh pustakon main hote the
 "beckett himself had an open view on this issue:" Christianity is a mythology that i am fully familiar with, so i naturally use it
 "as Cronin points out, his biblical references are" satirical or even That can also be sarcastic "
 "1937 main bachaav paksh ke vakil dwaara puche gaye sawaal ki ve isai the yaa yahudee yaa naastik, ke jawaab main baket ne kaha, 'teenon main se koi nahin'"
 baket kii sampoorn kriti ko dekhne par meri bryden ko pataa chalaa ki "baket ke granthon se ubharne vaala kaalpanik ishwar ek aisi hasti he jo apane vikrut anupasthiti ke saath-saath apni chaukas maujuudagi ke liye bhi shaapit he
 As a result he is dismissed, satirized or ignored, but he and his battered son are certainly never removed
 ek pratikatmak str par, ham do paatro estrogan or vladimir ko naatak main ullikhit do choron ke rup main dekh sakate hai
 Estragon is punished for some unknown reason which may mean that he is the thief who is scorned to curse Christ
 duusari ore, vladimir vah chor ho saktaa he jo ninda se batch niklaa he haalaanki yah keval bhautik he
 This retaliation reveals the arbitrary God represented by Beckett
 vatting for godot kaa varnan "russilon main lambii paidal yatra ke roopak ke rup main kiya gaya he jab baket or sujen din ke samay ghaas ke dher main so gaye the or jois ke liye baket ke rishte kaa lihaaj rakhane ke liye raat hone tak chalate rahe
" aarambhik masaude main mahatvapurn vyaktigat sandarbh shaamil hai lekin unhen baad main nikaal diya gaya
 Since the play finds reference to only male actors, because it rarely contains references to women, some people regard the relationship between Vladimir and Estragon as semi-rights: "they quarrel, they embrace each other, they embrace each other They can be considered a married couple
 " pehle ank main estrogan apane saathi ke paas dhire se jaakar uske kandhe par haath rakhkar us ke saath dhire-dhire baat karata he
 After asking for his hand in return and advising him not to stubbornly, he suddenly hugs her but retreats with the same speed complaining that "you smell garlic!" jab estrogan bible main uski samayik drishyon kii yaad dilaataa he or yaad karata he ki mrit sagar yaa ded si ke maanchitron ke rang kitne sundar the to vah tippanee karata he ki "ham vahiin jaaenge, main hameshaa yahi kaha karata tha ki ham apane honeymoon ke liye vahiin jaaenge
 ham tirenge
 hamen majaa aayega
" iske alaava, bina mahilaon vaale vishwa ke sandarbh main postmortem irection paane kaa laalach paidaa hota he
 Estragon in particular is "much more excited" than Vladimir, who chooses to talk about the ostentatious occasion
 apane saathi kii uttejan ke prati uski spasht udaseenta ko ek prakaar ke chanchal chhedhkhani ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Another possible example of synergism can be seen in the section in which Estragon "sucks" its ends, although Beckett describes it as an action
 baket apane kaary ke liye sabase arthpurna drushtikon ke liye khulaa nahin tha
 She is aware of this objection when several women's acting companies started staging the play in the 1980s
 ""mahilaon ke paas prostate nahin he," baket ne kaha, jo is baat kaa ek sandarbh thi ki vladimir ko peshaab karne ke liye baar-baar manch chhodkar janaa padataa tha
 In 1988, Beckett resorted to a Dutch theater company called de Harlemsay Tönlicheur to prosecute the issue
 "baket apana mukadmaa haar gaya
 But the issue of gender seemed so important to him that it became a distinction for a playwright to which he reacted so angrily that the publication of all his plays in the Netherlands was banned
 " 1991 main, tathaapi, "jaj huguate le foyer de ne faisla sunaaya ki prakaashan kii vajah se baket kii viraasat kii atyadhik kshati nahin hogi" or pratishthit aviganan samaaroh main brut de beton ke sabhi mahila kalaakon dwaara is naatak kaa vidhivat pradarshan kiya gaya
 In 2006, the Italian Pontadera Theater Foundation won a similar case when it presented two actresses in the roles of Vladimir and Estragon, although the traditional roles of the letters were male
 1995 ke acco samaaroh main diarector nola chilton ne lucky kii bhoomika main daniela misheli ke saath ek prastuti kaa manchan kiya or 2001main indiana vishvavidhyalay kii ek prastuti main pojo or ladke kii bhoomika ke liye mahilaon ko prastut kiya gaya
 "on 17 February 1952 


 an abbreviated version of the play was performed and broadcast on the radio in a studio called Club d'isai de la Radio 


 Although he sent a polite note that Roger Blinn read, but Beckett himself did not get it
 " a part of his preface stated that: minuit sanskaran 17 oktober 1952 main mudrit rup main naatak ke pehle purna naatakeey pradarshan se pehle dikhaai diya
 4 janvari 1953 ko "saarvajanik udghaatan se pehle en atendent godot ke jenarale ke liye tees sameekshak upasthit hue

 Initial public performances, however, were not event-less: the curtain fell after "lucky's monologue" during a performance as twenty dressed but disgruntled spectators began to sarcastically play the city
 

 unamem se ek pradarshnkaree ne le monde ke liye 2 farvari 1953 ko ek nindapurna patr bhi likh daalaa
" The ensemble cast consisted of Pierre Latur, Lucian Raimburg, Jean Martin and Roger Blinn

 donon ladakon kii bhoomika sarj lacoint dwaara nibhaai gai thi
 The entire presentation was completed on a very low budget; Martin's big and torn bag as an example "the theater dresser's husband was found in the city's garbage while he was cleaning the trash cans
" " From Beckett's perspective, a very important production took place at Lütringhassen, near Wuppertal, Germany

 She wrote to Beckett in October 1954: "you would be surprised to receive a letter from a prisoner about his play Waiting for Godot where so many thieves, fraudsters, goons, homos, madmen and murderers wait their worse lives 


 just spend while waiting
 kiskaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he? godot? shaayad
" baket bahut prabhavit hue or unhone antim pradarshan ko dekhne ke liye us kaidi se mulaaqaat karne kaa iraadaa kiya lekin aisa kabhi nahin hua

 It was premiered in the English language on 3 August 1955 at the Arts Theater in London, directed by 24-year-old Peter Hall
 praarambhik reharsal ke dauraan haul ne kalakaaron se kaha ki "mere paas vastav main koi aspasht vichaar nahin he jaisaa ki kuch log samajhate hai 


 lekin agar ham apana kaam band karke har pankti par charchaa karenge to ham ise kabhi nahin kar paaenge
" mudrit sanskaran ne ek baar phir baaji maar lee lekin febar ke "vikrut" sanskaran ko 1956 tak amal main nahin laayaa gaya

" kai jeevani vivaranon ko nikaal diya gaya jinamein se sabhi paath kii ek saamaanya "nirarthakta" ko badhaate hai jise unhone apni baaki jindagi bhar sanvaarte rahe
 In the 1950s Beckett's amazement led to a strict ban on theater in the UK as he considered it a supporter of free speech
 lord chemberlen ne is baat par jor diya ki "irection" shabd ko hataa diya jaae, "'fartove' 'popov' ban gaya or shrimati gozo ko 'clap' ke bajaay 'varts' mila
" vastav main naatak par puri tarah se pratibandh lagane kaa prayaas kiya gaya tha
 For example, Lady Dorothy Howitt wrote a letter to Lord Chamberlain stating: "one of the many themes that run throughout the play is the constant desire to free two old strollers on their own" is

 Beckett watched the event at Peter Woodthrop's Flat in Chelsea with some of his closest friends
 They were unhappy with what they saw
 unhone kaha "mere naatak ko is bakse ke liye nahin likhaa gaya tha

 Lasting only seven weeks and starring as an all-star, the play was an economically successful one, but criticisms of it were not particularly favorable, with Frank Rich of The New York Times writing, "the audience is still waiting for that excellent Godot Like many others who had passed Hock from Beckett's infinite universe before him, the Joker of Lincoln Center came and went

 Often the properties of alloys differ from the properties of the components that make up that alloy

 Mishratu is bronze, brass, stitch etc

 The art of alloying is very ancient
 satya to yah he ki kaanse kaa mahatv ek yug main itnaa adhik tha ki maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke us yug kaa naam hi 'kaansya yug' pad gaya he
 Although pure metals have many useful properties, such as the conductivity of heat and electricity, pure metals are not commonly used in mechanical and manufacturing operations, because they do not have the necessary strength
 dhaatu ko adhik majboot banane kii sabase mahatvapurn vidhi dhaatumishran he
 a lot of effort was made in this direction in the 19th century, the result of this is that more than five thousand alloys are available for many useful works today and new innovations are being done constantly to prepare new alloys
 aaj kisi vishesh upyog ke liye icchit gunonvali mishradhatuen banaai jaati he
 When metals dissolve in a common solution, such as an acid, they give off their metallic properties and normally form salts, but when melted they dissolve along with their metallic properties
 dhaatuon ke aise thos vilyan ko mishradhatu kehete hai
 Non-metals are also small in many alloys, but the quality of the whole remains metallic

 Determining whether alloys are simple mixtures or chemical compounds is a complex problem
 kuch arthon main ye rasinic yogic hai, kyonki jab sodium saras banaaya jaataa he, tab sodium ke har ek tukade ko paar main daalane se prakaash kii teevr jwaala nikalati he or paara garam ho jaataa he, yah yogic banane kaa lakshan he
 Similarly, when a piece of aluminum metal is added to the melting gold, so much heat is generated that the entire molten metal becomes brighter

 For example, both silver and zinc are white, but the alloy they make is very beautiful pink

 This property also has compounds

 The physical and chemical properties of alloys differ from the properties of their constituent metals, and the properties of alloys are by no means comparable to the properties of element metals
 yah bhinnata is kaaran se he ki jab dhaatuon ko ek saath pighalaate hai, tab ve kitne hi antaradhaatuk yogic tathaa thos vilyan banaati hai
 The density of an alloy can be less or greater than the mean density of its constituent metals
 kuch mishradhaatuon kaa rang apni avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul hi bhinn hota he
 They are harder than their constituent metals, but less flexible and malleable and more brittle
 mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank sarvada adhiktam taap par pighalanevaali avyavdhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 And usually at a minimum temperature the melting element is less than the melting point of the metal
 udaahranarth, ek mishradhatu, jisamen sisa, tin, bismuth tathaa cadmium hai, 75 ̊sein0 par galati he, jab ki nunatam taap par pighalane vaali avyav-dhaatu, tin kaa galnaank 232 ̊ sein0 he
 All these are the properties due to which alloys become more valuable than pure metals and prove more useful in industry
 upar varnit falon dwaara tathaa sookshmdarshi, eks-kiran varnakram maapi, ooshmiya tathaa rasinic vishleshan or duusare bhautik pareekshanon dwaara mishradhaaton ke sanghathan tathaa crystalia rachana ke vistrut adhyayan ke parinamswaroop, mishradhaatuon ko teen shreniyon main rakhaa gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of how the group of atoms of the constituent metals in the alloys is organized
 ye teen shreniyan nimnlikhit hai: In these types of alloys, when the element metals are molten, they dissolve in each other, but when solid, the crystals of the metals break apart, that is, the metals are insoluble
 is prakaar mishradhatu prayek avyav dhaatu ke shuddh crystal kaa mishran hoti he or thanda karne par koi ek avyav dhaatu thos rup main pruthak ho jaati he
 For example, a liquid alloy consisting of only 10 parts lead and 90 parts tin, when cooled, pure tin crystals are first separated in the same way as pure ice crystals cooled from a dilute solution of sugar
 Are separate jis taap par tin ke crystal pruthak hona prarambh karte he, vah taap shuddh tin ke galnaank se kam hota he
 When the melting point of the tin is dissolved in the lead, the molecular weight of the lead is determined by the same rule by which the molecules of the dissolved substances in the water are removed
 is vidhi se un kai dhaatuon kaa anubhaar nikaala gaya he, jo tanughatvik vilyan main alag parmaanu ke rup main rahati he
 Lead-antimony alloys belong to the mixture category
 antimony bhangur hota he or sisa mulaayam
 The printing metal is a alloy of CC, antimony and a very small amount of tin
 is mishradhatu main antimony kii kathorta to hoti he, kintu yah uski tarah bhangur nahin hoti
 In this type of alloys, the atoms of one element metal fit well in the crystalline structure of the other element metal
 thos vilyan shrenee kii mishradhatuen do bhinn prakaar kii hoti he: Many copper-nickel alloys that have significant use fall under the category of solid solutions
 udaahranarth, ve mishradhatuen jinase nikal ke sikke, rifl kii goliyon kii tapiyaan or ek taar jiskaa vaidyut pratirodh adhik hota he, banataa he
 Many of the Canadian minerals contain copper and nickel sulfides, which are smelted to form an alloy

 This alloy is called monel metal
 yah adhik tanya, lacheelee tathaa sanksharan pratirohak hoti he
 Generally, metals do not form compounds by mixing with each other, but by heat analysis it has been found that metals combine with each other to form a large number of compounds
 in yogicon kaa vargeey naam antaradhaatuk yogic he
 Most compounds of this type form alkali and alkaline clay metals, by combining them with the metals of the odd subclass of the periodic table
 in yogicon main dhaatuen kis maatra main mili hui hai, isko rasinic sutron dwaara darshaate hai
 It is known from the study of these formulas that these types of compounds violate all the laws of valency that are formed by the compounds formed by the combination of metals and non-metals
 udaahranarth, sodium, tin or sisa ke saath rasinic kriya kar nimnlikhit yogic banaata he : Many interstitial compounds are very stable and do not dissolve their constituents in metals even when heated to temperatures higher than their melting point
 ye yogic taral ammonia main ghulte hai or is prakaar se jo vilyan taiyaar hota he, vah vaidyut chaalak hota he
 When they are electrically decomposed, one component metal, which is less positive than the other, accumulates on the positive and the other on the minuscule
 antaradhaatuk yogic kyon banaata he, isaki abhi tak saidhantik vyakhya nahin hui
 Only so far it has been proved that those metals, which have the same properties, do not coincide with each other
 chunki is prakaar kii mishradhatuen kathor, bhangur, bahut hi kam tanyashil tathaa lacheelee hoti hai, at: inamen se keval kuch hi upyogi hai

 ] Transit means moving
 Go means star which you can understand as constellation or planet and variable means walking
 In this way, the complete meaning of transits is the movement of the planets
 In view of astrology, all the planets from the Sun to Rahu Ketu have their own movement

 The planets travel in different zodiac signs
 grahon ke bhraman kaa jo prabhaav raashiyon par padataa he use gochar kaa fal yaa gochar fal kehete hai
 a general rule for finding visible transit is that the zodiac at which the moon is born, that is, your first birth should be considered as the first house, after that the horoscopes should be prepared by sitting the zodiac signs accordingly
 In this horoscope, the planets should be seated according to the zodiac in which the planets are on that day
 After this, the transit of that day can be found on the basis of the planets' vision and utility
 surya, shukr, budh kaa bhraman kaal 1 maah, chandra kaa sava do din, mangal kaa 57 din, guru kaa 1 varsh, rahu-ketu kaa 1-1 / 2 va shani kaa bhraman kaa - 2-1 / 2 hota he When the planets present in the horoscope when conjunct the transiting planets, their flight is different with different planets, the way they give their influence on the native is as follows: - aapke janm grahon ke anusaar gochar fal Coordinates: 25 ° 06′N 85 ° 54′E / 25

 The reasons for which the equilibrium, or health, of various parts of the body are destroyed and distortions occur in them, are called causative and their science is called etiology
 ye kaaran anek hai
 They are divided into the following parts: ye hetukikaarak jis prakaar se vikrutiyon ko utpann karte hai, usko rogajanan kehete hai
 The pathologies that occur in different parts of the body due to pathological causes are known as pathologies and the description of the metal organ or intent with these deformities is called the deformed body and the pathology of these deformities is pathology or pathology
 vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy vividh rogakaarakon se vibhinn ango main jo vividh vikrutiyaan utpann hoti he, unka kaaryakaaran bhav pradarshit karnaa he
 The main purpose of pathology is to give an explanation of the gross and subtle forms of those deformities and to clarify the symptoms arising from various diseases based on them
 yah uddeshy vividh vyaadhiyon se mrit vyaktiyon ke sampurna itihaas ke saath, maranottar pareekshan se unke sharir ke vibhinn dhatvashayadi angon ke bheetar paae janevaali vikrutiyon, kaa mail kiye bina siddh nahin ho saktaa

 In this treatise, the extent to which the signs and symptoms found in various organs of patients correlate with the anatomical malformations found within their bodies
 iske pashchaat hi vikrutivigyaan ko swatantra astitv praapt hua
 Rudolph Fikhons began using the microscope in the 19th century to test for physiologic malformations and published his treatise on cellular pathology in 1846 AD
 is granth ne rogon ke swaroop kii tathaa unke abhyas ke liye koun-cone se saadhan prayukt hone chahie or prayukt ho sakate hai, inke sambandh kii kalpana main kranti paidaa kii tathaa vikruti vigyaan ko, jo pehle roganidan ke antargat ek chota sa vishay tha, nidaan kaa ek uttam adhishthan bana diya
 Despite the latent malformations in the body parts, the reaction, swelling, renovation, growth inhibition, degeneration, tumor, etc
 are some common types of Ini-guinea
 sharir ke bheetar in vikrutiyon kaa swaroop jab aasaani se indriya grahya hota he, tab usko sthool vikruti kehete hai tathaa sookshm swaroop kii vikruti hone par in vikrutiyon ko dekhne ke liye jab sookshmdarshi yantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab usko sookshm vikruti kehete hai
 Deformations emphasize the heterogeneity of various body parts and their anatomical and morphological changes and their functional changes in diseases
 saransh main vikrutiyon kaa ullekh vibhinn angon se sambandhit hota he or rog kaa ullekh adhiktar lakshanon se sambandhit hota he
 The disease remains in the form of malformations in the body from long ago
 keval vah bahut sookshm hone se indriyagrahya kam hokar buddhigrahya adhik hota he
 When complete body deformities and their causes are described according to the above general types, then it is called normal pathology and when each organ, intention or institution of the body is described independently of the above types of deformities
 Is, then it is called special pathology

 sharir kaa nirmaan karanevaale vibhinn utakon ke ke hraas, vinaash tathaa kshati ko saamaanya oothkakshay kehete hai
 Causes - The following are the major causes of tissue tissue saransh main oothkakshay kaa mukhya kaaran dhamni, shiraaon tathaa keshikaon main avrodh kaa hona he
 Due to this, nutritious substance does not reach the said place
 oothkakshay ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai : It is also a tissue-specific action
 jab kisi utak kaa apakarshan kaha jaataa he, to iskaa abhipraay utak main ek vishesh prakaar kaa parivartan samajhnaa chahie, jaise vasa apakarshan kehane se kisi ootkavishesh main vasa kii upasthiti he, aisa bodh hota he, usee ke anusaar namakaran bhi hota he, jaise hriday apakarshan, mansapeshiy apakarshan, yakruti apakarshan ityadi
 In other words, when there is a change in the chemical activity of the cell due to lack of nutritious diet of tissues, it is called detraction
 isamen koshika kii purnataya mrityu ho jaati he tathaa uske protoplasm se ek nae prakaar ke rasinic padaarth kii utpatti hoti hai
 This substance is completely different from the previous structure of the cell and thus the function of the cell is completely different
 jab koshika ke andar lasika main se ek vishisht padaarth nikalakar ikattha ho jaataa he, to use ant:spandan kehete hai
 This infusion is mainly adipose, calcareous and amyloid type, whereas ablation is fatty mucoid and colloid
 rakt ke abhaav se jab utak main ek prakaar kii sadan hone lagati hai, to use koth kehete hai
 It is of two types dry koth and humid
 shushk koth - jab kisi ek bhaag kii dhamni dwaara kisi ang main rakt pahunchnaa band ho jaataa he, to shushk koth kii utpatti hoti he
 Humid dictionary - In this, the movement of blood from the veins by a particular organ towards the heart stops completely
 rakt kii us sthaan par aamad hoti he, parantu nikaas nahin hota
 Apart from the above two types of coaths, there are other types of coaths as well, such as intercostal coath, infectious coath, pneumothritis, diabetes mellitus, senescent coath, and renal disease
 jeern yaa vinasht hue utak yaa koshikaon kii kriya yathasambhav pun: praapt kii jaae, is abhipraay se jo unka punarjanan hota he, vah punarnirmaan, yaa jirnoddhar kaha jaataa he
 It is such a special state of the body in which there is growth of body tissue
 saamanyat: arbud do prakaar ke hote hai : Soft tumors - These are fatal because they do not cause any harm to life
 ghaatak arbud- jin arbudon main vighatan atyadhik hota he, unamem utak kii si akruti nahin banati
 Their composition is different from that of tissue and their growth is very rapid
 ve sharir main shighratapurvak prasaarit hokar andar hi andar swasth avyavon ko aakraant karte hai
 The action of this internal transmission is called metastasis
 is kaaran ye bahut maarak bhi hote hai or isi se inhen ghaatak, dusht, yaa chand arbud kaha jaataa he
 When there is an attack of any pathogenic bacteria in the human body, then the nature inside the body resists them the most, and in this war, the body's thick cells protect the body from disease by destroying the force of those external bacteria
 sharir ke andar se utpann isi roganashak shakti ko pratiraksha kehete hai
 There are two types of immunity: swaabhaavik pratiraksha - kisi rog ke pratirodh main sharir ke andar jo swaabhaavik shakti utpann hoti he use swaabhaavik pratiraksha kehete hai
 Earned immunity - If a person does not have the resistance to a particular disease and retrospectively by himself or by any other measures, he can be called acquired immunity
 udaahranarth, haija, chechak, motitora, titains ityadi paidaa karanevaale kuch rogaanu aise chote hai jo ek baar sharir main pravesh karne par rog paidaa kar sakate hai, parantu thodi maatra main pravisht karne par rog ke prati pratiraksha shakti utpann karte hai
 The reason for this is that a toxin produces disease in the body due to excessive intake, but the same toxin creates immunity by staying in very small amounts

 By 1927, Dr
 Ambedkar decided to start a comprehensive and active movement against untouchability
 unhone saarvajanik andolanon, satyagrahon or jaluson ke dwaara, peyajal ke saarvajanik sansaadhan samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke liye khulwaane ke saath hi unhonen achhuton ko bhi hindu mandiron main pravesh karne kaa adhikaar dilaane ke liye sangharsh kiya
 He also launched a satyagraha in Mahad city to get the untouchable community the right to take water from the city's Chavdar pond
 1927 ke ant main sammelan main, ambedkar ne jati bhedbhaav or "chuaachhut" ko vaicharik rup se nyaaysangat banane ke liye, pracheen hindu paath, manusmriti, jiske kai pad, khulkar jaateey bhedbhaav va jatvaad kaa samarthan karte hai, kii saarvajanik rup se ninda kii, or unhone aupchaarik rup se pracheen paath kii pratiyaan jalaayin

 isaki smriti main prativarsh 25 disambar ko manusmriti dahan diwas ke rup main ambedakarwaadiyon or hindu daliton dwaara manaaya jaataa he
 In 1930, Ambedkar started the Kalaram Temple Satyagraha after three months of preparation
 kalaram mandir andolan main lagbhag 15,000 swayamsevak ikatthe hue, jisase nashik kii sabase badi prakriyaayein huin
 The procession was led by a military band, a batch of scouts, women and men marched in discipline, order and determination to see God for the first time
 jab ve dwaar tak pahunche, to dwaar brahman adhikariyon dwaara band kar die gaye
 By now, Bhimrao Ambedkar had become the biggest untouchable political figure till date

 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims

 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa

 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end
 vah janatantric samaaj vyavastha ke pakshdhar the, kyonki unka maananaa tha aisi sthiti main dharm maanav jivan kaa maardarshak ban saktaa he

 Surveying is the process in which the surveyor measures certain dimensions that usually occur on the surface of the earth
 surveykshan upkaran, jaise ki chauras or theodolite koniya apsaran, kshaitij, lamberup or dhalaan dooriyaan kaa upyog sateek maapan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 With computerization, electronic distance measurement, total station, GPS surveying and laser scanning supplementation have made traditional optical devices complementary
 This information is very important in transforming the data of the Earth's surface into a graphical model in the form of a map
 uske baad yah jaankaree civil ejiniyaron, thekedaaron or yahan tak kii dallalon ko bhi di jaati he taaki wo iskaa istemaal karke kramshah dizin taiyaar karen, nirmaan kaary karen or vyapaar karen
 imaarat yaa sanrachana ke tatwon kaa ek dusre se or simaaon kii sahi sthiti evam sameepvarti sanrachanaon ke sambandh main sahi aakaar or sthaan par hona aavashyak he
 Although surveying is a separate business with different qualifications and different licensing arrangements
 civil ejiniyaron ko surveykshan or maanchitran, ke mul or bhugolic soochna pranali main prashikshit kiya jaataa he
 Surveyors determine the location of railwayways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines, and lanes before they are built, as well as some other infrastructures, such as ports
 bhoomi surveykshan In the United States, the Land Survey of Britain, Canada and most Commonwealth countries is considered a distinct occupation
 bhoomi sangrakshakon ko engeenior nahin mana jaataa he or unka apana vyavsaayik sanghathan or apni licencing aavashyaktaaen hoti hai
 The services of a licensed land are generally required for surveying the range
 nirmaan surveykshan The construction surveyor is usually done by specialized technicians
 bhoomi surveykshakon ke vipareet, isaki parinaam yojana ko sanvaidhanik suvidha praapt nahin he
 The construction surveyor performs the following tasks: parivahan ejineering jan or maal ko kushalpurvak, surakshit or jeevant samaaj ke logon ke liye suchalak ho
 parivahan ejineering kaa sambandh inhen chizon se he
 This task includes - outlining, designing, constructing, maintaining transport infrastructure including roads, canals, highways, rail systems, airports, ports, and mass transit
 This includes transportation design, transportation planning, traffic engineering, urban Some aspects of engineering, line theory,] include areas such as intelligent transportation systems and transportation management shahari ejineering shahari avasanrachana se sambandhit he
 This includes mentioning, designing, manufacturing and maintenance
 This includes road, footpath, water supply network, drainage, management and execution of street light municipal solid waste, storage for many metals for public works and management, maintenance of public parks and cycle paths
 bhumigat upyogita network ke maamle main, yah bijli or doorsanchaar sevaaon ke sthaneey vitaran network ke naagarik bhaag ko bhi jod saktaa he 
 isamen kooda sangrahan or bas seva network kaa anukulan bhi shaamil he
 Some of these disciplines merge with some other civil engineering features, although municipal engineering focuses on these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built sequentially and are run by the same municipal administration
 girte hue yaa behate hue jal kii urja se jo vidyut utpann kii jaati he use jalavidyut kehete hai
 In 2005, around 816 gwe of hydroelectric power was generated worldwide, which is about 20% of the total electric power of the world
 yah bijli pradooshan rahit he
 And it is environmentally friendly
 bharat main vidyaman aarthik rup se dohan yogya tathaa arthksham jal sambhavyata 66 pratishat bhaar kaarak par 84,000 megawatt aanklit kii gai he 
 In addition, 6780 MW of installed capacity has been estimated from small, small and micro hydropower schemes
 94,000 megawatt kii sanchit sthapit kshamta ke saath pump kii gai bhandaran yojanaon hetu 56 sthalon kii bhi pahchaan kii gai he
 However, so far only 19
9% of this potential has been exploited
 vidyut, jal se utpann jal se praapt kii gai vidyutshakti ko jalavidyut kehete hai
 Hydropower is very important in the methods of generating electric power
 vishwa kii sampurna vidyut shakti kaa ek tihaai bhaag jalavidyut ke rup main praapt hota he
 Thus, the available energy in any form can be used for generation of electric power
 jalprapaat main girte hue pani main nihit urja kaa upyog pracheen kaal se hi panchakki ko chalaane main kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu is urja kaa vidyutshakti ke liye upyog beesvin shatabdi kii hi dein he
 Not only can the energy contained in falling water be used for power generation, but the kinetic energy contained in flowing water can also be used for power generation
 iske liye sabase pehle aise sthaan kaa chunaav karnaa hota he, jahaan band baandhakar prachur maatra main pani jamaa kiya ja sake or usamen nihit shakti ko vidyut shakti ke janan ke liye jal ko aavashyaktaanusaar nalon athwa khuli nahar ke dwaara bijligharon main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Both rain and land have to be studied to find the suitable place
 band aisi jagah banaaya jaataa he jahaan nunatam mulya main bana band adhiktam pani jamaa kar sake
 For this the natural condition of the place should be such that a river passes through a narrow path between the mountains passing through the valley, so that the dam can be converted into a large reservoir by making a dam at the narrowest place
 band ke upar ek or agratal banaaya jaataa he, jahaan se pani khuli nahar athwa nalon dwaara bijlighar tak le jaaya jaataa he
 This water drives large turbines located in the power plant, generating electric power in the planned generators
 tarabine, cement kancreet ke bane drafttub ke mukh par avasthit hota he
 The water rotates the blades of the turbine as it occurs in the guide vane and thus uses its inherent energy to drive the turbine
 chalate hue tarabine kii yantric urja vidyut urja main roopantarit kar di jaati he or is prakaar jal main nihit urja jalavidyut kaa rup le leti he
 After the turbine thus uses the power contained in the water, the water passes through the draft-tube to the immersion pool, from where it then flows back into the river
 draft-tub kii banaavat aisi hoti he ki pani kii shesh urja dhire dhire samaapt ho jaae, jisase baahar aane par nadi ke kinaaron ko kshatigrast na kare
 The energy contained in water depends on its volume and top
 sheersh ke anuroop jalavidyut yojanaon ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he : 1
 High top plan - more than about 200 meters
 2
 madhyam sheersh yojana - 50 meter se 200 meter tak
 3
 Low top plan - less than 50 meters
 yojana kaa aakaar evam praroop donon hi sheersh ke upar nirbhar karata he or usee ke anusaar uske tarabinon kaa praroop bhi
 Thus Francis turbine and paston cycles are suitable for high head
 madhyam sheersh ke liye shravak pravaahvale daab tarabine prayukt kiye jate hai
 Propellant type turbine is more suitable for lower head
 ucch sheershawali yojanaon main, saadharantaya, pani kaa aaytan adhik nahin hota
 Therefore, water is transported by taps to the runner's vaults from the turbine pool, enabling the energy contained in the water to drive the runner
 tund dwaara pani ke pawah or gati kaa niyantran karne se tathaa baltiyon par chode janevaale pani ke kone kaa vicharan karne se tarabine ke nirgat kaa niyantran kiya ja saktaa he or is tarah janit honevaali vidyutshakti kaa bhi niyantran ho saktaa he
 It is also possible to vary the angle of buckets and both controls can be done automatically
 nodak praroop ke tarabine ke ranor main keval teen yaa chaar pankh hi hote hai
 They are made of heavy steel
 kam sheershawali yojanaon main bahudhaa pani kaa aaytan bahut adhik hota he 
 Therefore, it is not possible to take water in the taps and use an open drain
 bhaar ke anuroop nirgat praapt karne ke liye tarabine main janevaale pani kii maatra kaa vicharan karnaa aavashyak hota he, jo dwaar khulaai dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 These gate guides are like a crescent and their position controls the water
 baari hone ke kaaran ye dwaar dravchaalit daab dwaara pravartit kiye jate hai
 Just as the angle of the guide panes, or buckets, of the Pelton cycle is rotated, they can also be introduced automatically
 swat: chaalit vicharan sarvo motor dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It is a small motor that rotates the hydraulic pressure
 iskaa nivesh tarabine ke nirgat kaa hi ek ansh hota he, at: uske anusaar vicharan karata he
 Thus, the work done by this motor depends on the output of the turbine, which corresponds to the load on it, and automatically controls the guide nettle, or opened by it, by subtracting the hydraulic pressure
 Is, or arranges the angles of buckets
 nodak praroop kii tarabine main caplen praroop kaa tarabine mukhya he
 Its specialty is its strong and high efficiency
 isaki duusari visheshta yah he ki bhaar vicharan se dakshata par bahut kam prabhaav hota he, jiske kaaran vicharanshil bhaar ke liye yah tarabine bahut hi upyukt hota he
 In medium head plans, in general, a mixed turbine is more commonly used, but its selection depends more on the top of the head
 pani ko tarabine main le jane ke liye sthir guide len kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Its output is varied by the variance of its angle
 kam sheershawala tarabine, saadharantaya, khule shashift ke upar sthit hota he
 They are surrounded by a spiral type of casing, allowing water to be carried by a uniform guide guide
 ucch sheershawale tarabine main yah aavaran dhaatu kaa bana hota he
 Turbines can be both horizontal and vertical
 parantu saamanyat:, urdhwadhar hi adhik prayog main aata he
 These have specific types of bearings, which also have to bear the distinguished lateral shock on the machine
 isliye inhen aghat vering kehete hai
 Lubrication of bearings and other moving parts is also a difficult problem in itself
 iske liye daab snehan vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, the lubricant oil is pressed and sent to the lubricating places
 tel pump dwaara daab utpann kii jaati he
 There is also a system of automatically shutting down the machine, so that it does not get damaged in such a situation
 snehak tel ko saaf karne ke liye ek tel filter hota he or snehan ke pashchaat garam ho janevaale tel kaa thandha karne ke liye tel sheetak kii bhi vyavastha rahati he
 His position is of paramount importance in hydroelectric schemes
 inaki sthiti, mukhyat:, prakritik evam bhautik kaarnon par nirbhar karti he
 Roughly 10 MW of power would be available if a hydroelectric scheme provided a top of 150 feet with a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second
 jalashay kaa anumaan bhi is aadhaar par lagaaya ja saktaa he, ki 1
13 varg mile ke kshetrafal main 1 foot pani keval 1 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah utpann karata he
 Therefore, to get a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second, the reservoir must have an average of 10 square feet of water over an area of 113 square miles
 kisi bhi jalavidyut yojana ko vyaavhaarik hone ke liye vah aavashyak he ki adhik se adhik sheersh evam pravaah ho
 Low-top schemes can only be practical when the flow of water is sufficient
 ucch sheershawali yojanaayen kam pravaah par bhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati he
 It is not mandatory for the power house to be near the dam
 jalashay pahaad par ho saktaa he or adhik sheersh paane ke liye bijlighar pahaad kii talahati main banaaya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, large tubes of water are transported to the power station
 ucch sheersh vaali yojanaayen saamanyat: isi praroop kii hoti hai
 In many places the water is transported to another power station in the hill by cutting the hill
 bijlighar kaa prithvital par hona bhi anivaary nahin
 Many power stations are also inside the earth and can be accessed only by lift
 mathan main bhi aisa hi bhumigat bijlighar banaaya gaya he
 Such power houses are of the automatic type and operated from the ground floor by remote control
 yadhyapi ye bijlighar mukhyat: prakritik kaarnon se hi prithvi ke andar banaae jate hai, tathaapi ye samrik drushtikon se surakshit hone ke kaaran bahut mahatvapurn hote hai
 There are many low-end schemes in our country
 ganga evam sharada naharon ke upar bahut se bijlighar banaae gaye hai, jinamein keval 20 se 30 foot ke sheersh kaa hi upyog kiya gaya he
 These schemes have become feasible due to high water flow
 jalavidyut yojanaayen, mukhyat:, norge, sweden, switsraland, germany, france, canada, rus evam america main hai
 India is also not far behind in hydroelectric schemes and some of the schemes here are counted among the world's greatest schemes, such as bhakra-nangal, Damodar Valley, Rihand, Hirakund, Nagarjuna Sagar, Koyna, Shivasamudram, Periyar etc
 bahut si jalavidyut yojanaayen bahuddeshiy bhi hoti hai
 These are mainly included with irrigation and flood prevention schemes, so that all-round development of the area can be done
 america main tennesi ghati nigam ke aadhaar par bharat main bhi damodar ghati nigam kii sthapana kii gai
 Many important hydroelectric schemes have been made in the last twenty years and plans are being made after studying the hydroelectric potential everywhere
 jalavidyut yojana main, yadhyapi, aarambh main bahut adhik vyay hota he, tathaapi tab bhi parichaalan vyay kam hone ke kaaran adhikansh yojanaayen aarthik drushtikon se safal hoti hai
 The life of their plant is also relatively much longer
 inkaa mukhya dosha vastav main inaki upabhokta sthanon se duuri he
 These plans cannot be made for wherever they are
 udaahranarth, yadi shakti kii maang kalkatte main he, to vahaan jalavidyut yojana karyanvit karnaa sambhav nahin
 The rivers originating from the Himalayas contain immense water power, but there is no demand for power
 is prakaar jalavidyut yojana dwaara janit vidyut shakti ko bahudhaa bahut duuri tak preshit karnaa hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to incur the expenditure of the remittance system for a comparative study of the hydroelectric scheme
 tab bhi adhikanshat: jalavidyut hi sasti padati he
