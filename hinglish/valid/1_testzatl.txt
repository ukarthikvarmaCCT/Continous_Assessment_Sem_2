 Nowadays the word distillation is used in a wider sense than the old one
 bhabhake main vashpavan dravya ko udaana or udi hui bhaap ko thanda karke phir chua lenaa, yah sabaki sab prakriya aswan kehalaati he
 The purpose of distillation is that any vapor fraction can be separated from other vapor constituents

 a simple definition of distillation is to steam the solvent out of the solution and then condense it
 is paribhaasha ke bheetar 'saadhaaran aswan' or 'prabhajit aswan', donon sammilit hai
 One method that is similar to distillation is called sublimation
 urdhvapathan main vashpavan thos padaarth bhabhake main garam karke udaaya jaataa he or phir us bhaap ko thanda karke thos shuddh padaarth praapt kar liya jaataa he
 In Loksakthya, the word "asava" is used in the sense of sura or liqueur
 drakshasav, ushirasav aadi aasav ayurveda granthon main prasiddh hai
 The earliest mention of Asuta Sura in the episode of Sautramani is found in the 19th chapter of the Yajurveda
 suradhani kumbhi vah paatr tha jisamen taiyaar kii hui sura rakhi jaati thi
 Drugs such as dry ginger, punarnava, pippali etc
 were used in making sura from unripe paddy and barley
 lagbhag teen raat ye padaarth pani main sadate rahete the or phir ubaal or chaanakar sura taiyaar kii jaati thi
 The most excellent example of distillation in nature is the rise of water vapor from the saltwater of the sea, then the steam reaching the colder part of the atmosphere, cooling and raining as pure water

 Steam from the steam reaches the condenser
 sanghnitr anek prakaar ke prachlit hai
 The purpose of all condensers is that the steam cools down quickly and thoroughly
 yah aavashyak he ki sanghnitr main adhik se adhik prishth us hawa yaa pani ke sampark main aae jiske dwaara bhaap ko thanda hona he
 Copper is a good conductor of heat
 isaki nalikaayen yathesht patali ban sakati he; at: kaarkaanon main adhiktar tambe ke hi sanghanitron kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 In fact, the condenser is a device in which the hot steam cools from one end to the other
 jin dravyon ke kvathanank bahut unche hai, unki bhaap hawa se thandi kii ja sakati he
 Air condensers are used for this
 alcohol, benzin, ether aadi dravon kii bhaapon ko thanda karne ke liye aise sanghanitron kaa prayog hota he jinamein pani ke pravaah kaa prabandh ho
 The third part of the distillation apparatus is the receiver

 There are many types of receipts as well
 teen prakaar ke aswan mahatvapurn maane jate hai - prabhajit aswan, nirvaat aswan or bhanjak aswan
 In divided distillation, a solution, that is, a mixture, can be separated from those liquids whose boiling points are sufficiently different
 dravon kaa vaashp prabhajit aswan ke sanghanitron main is prakaar kramash: thandha kiya ja saktaa he ki grahi main pehle ve drav hi chue jo saapekshat: thandha kiya ja saktaa he jo saapekshat: adhik vashpavan hon
 The heat which is used for this work increases gradually
 nirvaat aswan ke liye aisa prabandh kiya jaataa he ki bhabhake or sanghnitr ke bheetar kii vaayu pump dwaara bahut kuch nikal jaae
 The boiling point of the solvents also decreases when the air pressure is over the solution and they can be distilled at relatively low temperature
 bhanjak aswan ek prakaar kaa shushk aswan hota he
 The best example of this is coal distillation
 pathar ke koyale main pani kaa ansh to kam hi hota he, par jab vah adhik tapt kiya jaataa he to uske prabhanjan dwaara anek padaarth banate hai jinhen bhaap banaakar udaaya or phir thanda karke thos yaa drav kiya ja saktaa he
 Some gases can also be formed in the sun which do not become liquid or solid when they are cold, but they are useful only in the form of gas; For example, it is possible that these gases can be used to create light or heat by burning them with air
 pathar ke koyale se prabhanjak aswan se is prakaar kii gaison ke atirikt criyosot, nafthaileen aadi padaarth praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 Kerosene distillation can also be done
 saadhaaran aswan kaa upyog itr taiyaar karne main bhi kiya jaataa he

 Even though Kalki's historical romance stories have captured the hearts of thousands of readers by recreating the glorious Tamil life of the Pallava and Chola dynasties, critics have been divided on the basis of their literary merit

 Protein and choline are rich in it in terms of nutrients
 prayek jati kii chidiyon ke andon main, thodi bahut bhinnata bhale hi ho, par inaki apni ek visheshta hoti he
 The size, shape and color of the eggs of birds of each race is unique
 pakshiyon ke jivan or unke angon ke aakaar, maap, sataha kii rachana or rang main ek sambandh he
 Similarly, there is a relation between the number of eggs within a bulk or group and the number of clots in a season
 andey kii maap mukhyat: anda denevaali chidiya ke dealdol par nirbhar karti he, kintu yah aavashyak nahin he ki anupaat hameshaa ek ho
 There are two reasons for this : murgi ke andey kaa jo aakaar hota he, vahi aakaar praaia: anya chidiyon ke andon kaa hota he
 The egg is long in one direction and has one end rounded and the other end slightly pointed
 andey ek chor par gol or duusare chor par nukile hone se saralata se ludhak nahin pate
 Also, with the pointed portion of the eggs being centered in the middle of the nest and their spherical portion facing out, if the nest contains three to four eggs, they all easily hatch
 kuch chidiyon ke andey lagbhag golakaar hote hai
 Owl eggs are spherical and bacassi eggs are thin and round at both ends
 kuch chidiyon ke andon kii satahen chikani hoti hai, kuch kii chamakili, kuch kii bahut adhik paalishdaar or kuch kii khurdari tathaa khadianuma hoti he
 The color of eggs also varies in different sparrows
 kuch chidiyon ke andey bilkul safed hote hai, kintu kuch ke andey rangeen, hare, nile, bhure or lalachaunh hote hai
 Some have the same color of eggs and some have pinto or speckled
 chitiyaan dhabbe ke rup main, athwa chaktton ke rup main hoti he or thodi athwa atyadhik sankhya main hoti hai
 The spots may be evenly scattered on the surface of the eggs, or more in one part and less in another
 kuch jati ke pakshiyon main ek hi jati ke antargat vibhinn sadasyon ke andon ke rang or chihnon main vyaktigat bhinnata hoti he
 Egg color is predominantly defensive
 atev hari daaliyon par die janevaale andon kaa rang haraa or jameen par die janevaale andon kaa rang praaia: bhura hota he
 Cotter or burrow eggs are often white, so that birds can detect them even in the dark
 gilmaat or regerbil keval ek hi anda detii hai, paravat yaa junglee kabutar or garud do, dhomara yaa gangachilli kii vibhinn jatiyaan teen or tittibh kii anek jatiyaan chaar andey detii hai
 Many species lay up to five to six eggs
 kuch gaanevaali choti kism kii chidiyon main saat aath se lekar das baarah tak andey milte hai
 Some hunting birds and ducks have even higher numbers
 adhikansh chidiyaan, yadi unke andey chura liye jaaain, athwa nasht ho jaaain, athwa andon ko tyaagane ke liye ve baadhya kar di jaayen, to phir se andey detii hai, kyonki har pakshi ke andon kii ek nishchit sankhya hoti he
 Until this number is reached, it does not stop laying eggs
 chidiyaan saadharantaya ek ritu main ek hi baar ade detii hai
 Some singing birds produce children two or three times during the season
 jin chidiyon ke andey or bachche adhik nasht hote hai, athwa jo alpaayu hoti hai, unamem janan teevr gati se or andon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 The age of sparrows also affects their number of eggs
 pratham baar maan bananevaali chidiyaan kam or duusari yaa teesri baar andey denevaali chidiyaan adhik andey detii hai
 When the number of eggs is complete, their army begins
 pakshi badi lagan or tatparta se andey sete hai, apane pankhons se unhen garam rakhte tathaa unki raksha karte hai : In most castes, both males and females perform the function of ovulation, even though the hatching works slightly more then the other
 kabhi kabhi din main maadaa andey seti he or raatri main nar
 In some castes, only females lay eggs, but in such a state the male raises food for it
 kisi kisi jati main nar or maadaa baari baari sein aate jate rahete hai
 During the egg-intake period, the female gets attention in hatching and such a concentration is created that if someone removes her eggs and keeps any other thing, like stone pieces, ballasts, etc
, then she will be without See, they will sit and sit on them
 bahudhaa aisa dekha gaya he ki andon ke kharaab yaa nirjeev ho jane par bhi maadaa ek lambii avadhi tak unhen seti rahati he
 In pigeons, the male incubates the egg with great fervor
 yahi nahin, balki maadaa ko hataakar swayan andon par baithta he
 The male cannot give himself, but in the desire of childbirth, he somehow binds the female and binds her, fetches the eggs from the female and then performs all the activities of her hatching and grooming herself with great enthusiasm
 lapland or ouk jati ke pakshiyon main nar kii sankhya adhik he, maadaa kii kam
 Thus, not all male pairs are successful in tying, but their desire for hatching and rearing of children does not go through their heart
 isse thik vipareet kuch pakshi aise bhi hai, jo andon ko swayan na sekar dusron se sevate hai
 Cuckoo, papiha etc
 are the main among them, who steal their eggs in the nests of crows, sparrows or satbhaiya etc
 and fool them and take care of them as midwives
 kuch aise pakshi hai, jo andon ko na to swayan sete hai or na auron se sevate hai, balki unhen dhoop ke taap se pakaakar unki raksha karte hai

 There are many birds, which are built near a hot spring and lay eggs in them, then cover them and go elsewhere
 jharne ke ushn jal se ye andey garam rahete hai
 At the end of the time, they come back and remove the top soil, then the children come out after breaking the eggs
 jahaan atyadhik garmi padati hai, vahaan ke pakshi andon ko thandha rakhane kii vyavastha karte hai, garam rakhane kii nahin
 For this, they soak their beaks in water and soak eggs in them, so that they do not get damaged due to excessive heat
 sevankaal bhi, chidiyon main vibhinn hota he
 In larger sparrows or in sparrows whose children develop well, the intake period is longer
 kisi kisi main sevankaal ek maheene kaa or kisi kisi main do saptaah se bhi kam kaa hota he
 Months are spent incubating eggs on a bird
 murgi ko anda sene main teen saptaah lagate hai, teetar ko chaar, hans ko paanch tathaa cander naamak pakshi ko puure do maheene
 Birds' eggs are laid outside and embryonic development takes place inside the eggs

 They remain in a state of immortality and spend their infancy days in weeks in Dhansale
 andey se baahar aane par shishu chidiya ke pratham kuch saptaah kuch vishesh kathinaaiyon evam khataron ke hote hai
 These days she is not only small and weak, but often unable to swallow food herself and is also helpless by flying

 Yes, if they are not teased, then after birth they would like to remain silent for a few hours
 ye prarambh se hi apana dana swayan chugana shuru kar dete hai
 Ducks and chickens are good examples of this
 junglee chidiyon main tittibh, jalkukkuti, batakh or shikaar kii anya chidiyon ke shishu bhi aisa hi karte hai
 Another feature of hunting birds is that they also start flying soon
 needvasi shishu janm ke pashchaat bade hone tak ghonsle main hi pade rahete hai or inhen aahaar ke liye apane maan baap par hi purnat: nirbhar rahanaa padataa hai
 They are blind and helpless at birth and more or less bare in most cases; That is, they are non-smoking and unattractive

 Cormorant and Buck are a group of birds whose children are completely naked at birth, that is, they live on very little on their body

 In child protection it is often seen that birds do not even worry about their lives

 Often they start to see it and hang it as if they were injured by a hunter

 In this way, taking the enemy away from the nest and astray him, so that he can move in some other direction and avoid the calamity on the babies of the needles

 When they are sometimes surrounded, they lie dead and lie on the ground, which the viewer considers them dead and moves forward

 Sometimes even if caught, they pretend to be dead, so that we can leave them as dead

 Early films were based on Fleming's novels and short stories, after which films with original plot began to appear
 It remains one of the longest-running film series in French history, under continuous production from 1962 to 2010, during which it saw a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995

 In 1961, Broccoli again partnered with Harry Saltzman and bought the film rights to all Bond novels from Fleming
 However, many Hollywood film studios did not want to invest in the film, as they found it "too British" or "overly erotic"
 The producers needed US $ 1 million for the conversion of Thunderball or Dr
 No, and in July 1961 the deal was signed with United Artists
 donon nirmaataaon ne ioen productions kaa gathan kiya or dow no kaa nirmaan shuru kiya
 a contest was arranged for 'the Search for James Bond' and the finalists were shortlisted for six screen tests by Broccoli, Saltzman and Fleming

 The producers turned to Sean Connery, who eventually played Bond in five consecutive films
 According to one story, Connery was suggested by Polish director Ben Fyz, a friend of Saltzmann's
 saltzman ne conary ko on da fiddle, main dekha jo is kalakaar kii gyarahavin film thi
 According to other sources, Broccoli first saw Connery at a screening of Darby o'gill and The Little People
 broccoli or fleming, conary ko lekar aashwast the, lekin unhen tab sweekaar kiya jab unhen patric macguhan dwaara asweekaar kar diya gaya or unke liye unhone richard johnson, james mesun, rex harrison, david niven, trevor harvard or broccoli ke dost kairi grant ko khaarij kiya
 As Broccoli later said, "I wanted a strong man

 pehle se hi ganje ho rahe conary ne apni sabhi bond filmon main wig pahana tha
 Connery stated that "after all, that character is not really me"
 Ian Fleming told his research assistant after watching a preview screening of the first film Dr
 No, "horrible
 Absolutely terrible
" Dr
 No received mixed reviews, some quite unfavorable, and even faced the Vatican rebuke
 Fleming consequently befriended Connery so much that he could establish a Scottish ancestry for Bond in later novels

 The growing attraction of this film further increased when President John F
 Kennedy also cited the name From Russia with Love in his ten favorite books

 Some critics rejected Bond's fascination even after Connery's second film and called From Russia with Love "a film made for Dulatti"

 For Auric Goldfinger, Theodore Bickel was being considered, but the role went to a famous actor in Europe, Gert Frobe, whose heavy accent required dubbing his voice
 lokapriy samskruti ke aadhaar par goldfinger sabase vikhyath bond film he
 The use of a dangerous laser, invented only a few years ago and not widely known by the public, was a cutting-edge display of real technology and perhaps the most memorable line of Bond films found in this film: bond: kya aap mujhase baat karne kii ummid karte hai?goldfinger: nahin, mistar bond, main aapse marane kii ummid karata hum! The premiere in Britain provoked almost a riot

 As a result, eon's production of Bond's fourth film, Thunderball, was delayed due to legal disputes between the authors

 Connery was eager to start working, but in a pre-production interview he admitted that "my only complaint about the Bond films is that they don't put any emphasis on you as an actor
 What you need is Anatomy like a rugby player so that you can do 18 weeks of training in swimming, punches and lovemaking


 i want to see someone else become a bond
 "template: James Bond Timeline Connery later stated that Thunderball was his personal favorite performance as Bond
 Thunderball was the most successful Bond film to date by gross box office, grossing around $ US1 billion
 It also inspired other detective films of the 1960s, including the "harry Palmer" trilogy starring Michael Caine, the "derek Flint" series with James Cowburn, the Matt Helm series with Dean Martin

 The title was taken from a pseudo-haiku written by Fleming in the book "you Only Live Twice / Once When You're Born / And Once When You Look Death in the Face
" And the martial arts and ninja scene were brand new at the time
 yu onli liv twis aisi pehali james bond film thi jisamen se fleming kii strot saamagree ke kathanak aadhaar ko baahar nikaal diya gaya tha, haalanki film kaa sheershak vahi rakhaa gaya
 Based on the film's screenplay entirely in Japan, the use of Blofeld as the main villain, and a Bond girl named Kisii Suzuki - the page script, screenplay and presentation were entirely the product of the screenwriter, and they took it to pre-marked locations Filmed, such as Ninja Fort and Volcanic Mountain
 This became common during the Roger Moore period, but only in this Connery film, in such a fundamental way, as the series went beyond Fleming, who died about three years before the release of Only Only Live Twice Had finished yu onli liv twis ke baad or postaron par "shaun conary, james bond hai" prachaarit karne ke baavjood, conary ne ghoshnaa kii ki yah unki aakhri bond film he

 In Fleming's novel, Bond attempts to avenge his wife's murder in You Only Live Twice at Her Majesty's Secret Service
 lekin chunki baad vaali film kaa filmakan pehle hua tha, blofeld ko diamonds aar forever kahani main rakhaa gaya taaki bond ko blofeld ko fatkaarane kaa avasar mil sake
 This meant that instead of Fleming's three stories about Blofeld she had four

 In early 1972, the search for Connery's replacement began once again
 jeremi brett, maaikel billington or julian glover par shrunkhlaa main agali film, liv and let daai ke liye vichaar kiya gaya or pantalis varshiya roger moore ko chunaa gaya
 Moore was Bond for the longest time and spent twelve years in this role and did seven films
 moore ne koshish kii ki ve shaun conary yaa da saint main simon templer kii apni bhoomika kii nakal naa karen or unhone bond ko adhik prasannchit or vinodi rup main abhinit kiya
 In contrast to the manner in which Lezenbai was introduced, Moore's first two films actually take away the common motifs of the Bond films and give him cigars instead of cigarettes and he drinks bourbon instead of martini
 ek sameekshak ne kaha, "roger moore main shaun conary kii zaraa si bhi gambhirtha nahin he
 

 He sits proficiently in the director's rendition of Bond as the deadly comedian "
 bond kaa apana sanskaran banane kii chunauti ke antargat, moore ne apni shrunkhlaa da saint main apni bhoomika kii kuch visheshtaon ko bond ke vyaktitv ke saath mishrit kiya
 Critics found this Bond more of a magician, more indulgent, more analytical and more perfunctory, and to a lesser extent sexist

 The main title comes after the gun barrel scene in Dr
 No, but all subsequent films feature pre-title scenes or "teasers" before titles that are partially related to the film's screenplay, fully Or is not related at all
 The gun barrel scene since Thunderball follows unhindered in the pre-title scene where the opening scene can be seen through the gun barrel

 When they are not related to the main story, Bond is usually shown in the order of completion of a mission, or undergoing an extraordinary rescue
 In three teasers, the film's villains are shown committing their crimes in Bond's absence
 With the introduction of The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977, teasers not only emphasized the action sequences but also introduced death-defying stunt scenes, a practice that went as far as Casino Royale
 The sequence of The World Is Not Enough is unusually long: being more than 14 minutes, it is three times as long as the others
 isi tarah, kwantum of soles is frenchiz kii pehali film he jisaki shuruyaat pichhali kist kisino royaal kii samaapti se sidhe shuru hoti he
 The main title scenes include visual elements that reflect each film's theme and often depict nude and erotic women with moving images that usually reflect the film's general theme; For example, Thunderball depicts deep diving in the ocean and is associated with the opening scene; The initial sequence of Casino Royale, appropriately, depicts a casino design

 Much of the charm of this film is Bond's charming character
 vyaktitv main, bond kathor, krur, alag or ghamandi he - jo bolta kam or kaam karne main zyada vishwaas rakhata he
 This is similar to the earlier Fleming novels, while later novels have a more evocative amount of insight into Bond which is rarely seen in films

 On aesthetic grounds, he enjoys delicious cuisine, good wine and plenty of beautiful women

 There is a simple variation in themes between the actors, attributed to the scriptwriters for how they write for the actors
 moore kaa bond thodaa namr he or apane purvavartiyon yaa uttaradhikariyon kii tulana main thodaa adhik romantic he
 Craig's Bond is slightly more melancholy and introverted, while Dalton's Bond is particularly devious and grumpy, while also possessing Moore's romantic qualities

 After the shark incident, he is taken out of the CIA by a pensioner and works at the Pincherton Detective Agency as reserved in the ninth book Thunderball until being called back to the CIA

 Since then, Leiter has been cast by various actors, with only David Hudison playing the role more than once before Quentum of Solace

 The main villain often tries to kill Bond in a slow and long fashion, such as leaving him in front of a shark or crocodile, or tying him to a table with a laser beam

 Bond" in which the player had the option of killing a spy
 baad vaale ke safal hone kii kam sambhaavna thi, lekin khilaadi ko adhik ank milte the agar yah hota tha

 un sab ne uttar diya, "bas use goli maar dijiye
 uske saath lager beam yaa shark vaali nautanki mat kijiye
 vah usase nikalne kaa koi naa koi tarika pataa laga legaa

 khalanaayak kaa adda ek dweep ho saktaa he pahaad ke upar kaa adda yaa bhumigat adda, ek jahaaj ek tel sanyantr yaa ek antariksh stesan bhi

 In some cases, the villains flee with their operatives to launch a final attack on Bond and his girlfriend; Along with this, some villains return to later films such as Blofeld, Jaws and Mr
