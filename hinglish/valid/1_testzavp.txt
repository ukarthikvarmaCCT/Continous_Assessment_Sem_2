siddhanthata, is seemaa ko plank dravyaman ke aasapaas hona chahie, jahaan aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum prabhaav saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko galat sabit kar denge
 For this reason, the possibility of creation of a black hole on or around the Earth can be completely ruled out
 haalaanki, kwantum gurutv ke kuch vikaas aisa darshaate hai ki is bandha kii seemaa kaaphi neeche ho sakati he
 For example, some Brainworld landscapes keep the Planck mass far below, perhaps as low as 1 tev / c2
 yah, sookshm blike hole ke nirmaan ko ucch urja takkaron yaa CERN ke vishaal hadran colider main sambhav kar saktaa he
 However, all these theories are quite imaginary and many scientists are of the opinion that the creation of black holes in these processes is not possible
 ek baar banane ke baad blike hole, atirikt padaarthon ke avasorana dwaara viksit hona jari rakhata he
 All black holes will continue to absorb interstellar dust and ubiquitous radiation, but none of these processes have any significant effect on the mass of a stellar black hole
 adhik mahatvapurn yogadan tab hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa nirmaan ek dwiadhari tara pranali main hoti he
 The black hole can absorb a large amount of matter from its partner after formation
 atyadhik bade yogadan tab praapt hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa anya taron yaa compact vastuon se vilay hota he
 The supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies may have been formed by the merger of many smaller objects
 isi prakriya ko kuch madhyavarti drabyaman vaale blike holon ke nirmaan ke liye bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he
 As an object moves towards the event horizon, the horizon begins to swell and swallow it
 iske sheeghra baad trigya kaa vistaar puure hole main samaan rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black, but they also emit small amounts of thermal radiation
 unhen yah parinaam mila ek sthir blike hole prishthbhumi main pramaatra kshetra siddhant kaa prayog karke
 The result of their equations is that a black hole must leave particles in an ideal black body spectrum
 yah prabhaav hawking vikiran ke rup main janaa gaya
 Since the Hawking result, many have verified this effect through various methods
 yadi blike hole vikiran kaa yah siddhant sahi he, to aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki blike hole vikiran ke tapiya kiranpunj ko nikaalenge or isse drabyaman kaa kshay hoga, kyonki saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar drabyaman ucch sanghanit urja maatr he 
 samay ke saath blike hole sikud kar hawa main ud jaayenge
 The temperature of this beam remains proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which in turn is inversely proportional to mass
 isliye bade blike hole chote blike hole se kam vikiran chhodte hai
 The Hawking temperature of a stellar black hole with 5 solar masses is about 12 nanokelvins
 yah antarikshawya sookshm-tarang prishthbhumi dwaara utpaadit 2
7K se kaaphi kam he
 Black holes with stellar mass gain more mass than they emit through Hawking radiation from the cosmic microwave background, so they spread rather than shrink
 2
7 k se adhik hawking taapmaana praapt karne ke liye, ek blike hole ko chandramaa se bhi halkaa hona padegaa 
 On the other hand if a black hole is very small, it is expected that its radiation effect will be very powerful
 ek blike hole jo manushyon kii tulana main bhi baari he, kshan main lupt ho jaayegaa
 a black hole weighing a car will take only one nanosecond to evaporate, during which time its brightness will exceed 200 times that of the sun
 halke blike hole se ummid kii jaati he ki ve or bhi teji se vashpit ho jaayenge, udhaaharan ke liye 1 tev / c 2 drabyaman vaala ek blike hole puri tarah lupt hone main 10−88 second se bhi kam samay lagayegaa
 Of course, for such a small black hole the quantum gravity effect is expected to play an important role and even - although recent developments in quantum gravity provide no clue to it - hypothetically such small black holes are stable Will be adhikansh abhivruddhi discs tathaa gas jet kii maujuudagi taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa spasht saboot nahin he, kyonki neutron taare or safed bunon jaisi anya adhik drabyaman vaali or ati ghani vasteen abhivruddhi discon or gas dhaaraon ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakati hai or unka vyavhaar vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa blike hole ke irdagird hota he
 But they can often help astronomers by telling them where the search for a black hole can prove to be fruitful
 magar duusari taraf, ati vishaal abhivruddhi discs or gas dharaaen atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa acha saboot ho sakati hai, kyonki jahaan tak ham jaanate hai keval ek blike hole hi in ghatnaon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Static X-rays and gamma ray emissions also do not prove the presence of a black hole, but can tell astronomers where to search would be fruitful - and they have the advantage of being able to easily detect clouds of gas and gas Get out lekin shaktishaalee, aniyamit eks-re, gamma kirane or anya vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran yah sabit karne main madad kar sakate hai ki vah vishaal, ati ghani vastu ek blike hole nahin he, taaki "blike hole akhetak" kisi anya vastu kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 Neutron stars and other very dense wires have surfaces and the collision with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light emits intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals
 blike hole main koi thos sataha nahin hoti he, isliye kisi atyadhik drabyaman vaali ati saghan vastu ke irdagird aniyamit antaraal par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa abhaav, yah darshata he ki vahaan ek blike hole ke milane kii acchhee sambhaavna ho sakati he
 The intense but single-handed release of the gamma ray may indicate the birth of a "new" black hole, as astrophysicists think that the cause of grbs is either the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a collision between neutron stars, And both these events involve enough mass and pressure to create a black hole
 lekin aisa prathit hota he ki ek neutron taare or ek blike hole ke bich kaa takaraav bhi ek GRB paidaa kar saktaa he, isliye ek GRB saboot nahin he ki ek "nae" blike hole kaa gathan hua he
 All known grbs come from outside our own galaxy and most come from billions of light years away, so the black holes associated with them are actually billions of years old
 kuch antariksh-bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he ki kuch ati chamkile eks-re strot madhyavarti-drabyaman vaale blike hole ke abhivruddhi discs ho sakate hai
 Kasars are believed to be the accretion disks of a highly massaging black hole, as no known object is so powerful that it can emit so powerful
 qasaar puure vidyut-chumbakeey spectrum main shaktishaalee utsarjan utpann karte hai, jisamen shaamil hai yuvi, eks-re or gamma-kiran or apni ucch chamak ke kaaran ye kaaphi duuri se bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Between 5 and 25 percent of the quasars are "radio loud", a noun due to their powerful radio emission
 ek gurutveey lens kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab kisi bahut dur sthit ujjwal strot se aati hui prakaash kii kirane kisi vishalkay vastu ke aasapaas "mud" jaati hai, darshak or strot vastu ke bich
 is prakriya ko gurutveey lencing ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah saamaanya saapekshata siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyon main se ek he
 According to this theory, space "time" assimilates to create mass gravitational fields and therefore bend light as a result
 lens ke peeche ke strot kii chhavi ek paryvekshak ko kai chhaviyon ke rup main dikhaai pad sakati he
 If the source, the heavy lensing object and the observer are in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the heavy object
 gurutveey lencing blike hole ke alaava anya vastuon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki koi bhi ati shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra prakaash kirnon ko modane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Some of these multi-image effects are probably caused by remotely located galaxies
 blike hole kii parikrama karti vasteen, kendriya vastu ke aasapaas ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa anveshan karti rahati hai
 An older example, discovered in the 1970s, is the accretion disk orbiting around the fictitious black hole responsible for Cygnus X-1, a well-known X-ray source
 haalaanki swayan padaarth ko to sidhe taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa, eksre kii timatimaahat mili secondon main jari rahati he, jaisaa ki lagbhag das saura drabyaman vaale ek blike hole ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale kisi garm pind rupi padaarth se abhivruddhi se thik pehle ummid kii jaati he
 The x-ray spectrum represents the specific shape that is expected from a disc containing orbiting relativistic materials, with an iron line emitted at ~ 6
4 kev, and widened to red and blue
 ek anya udhaaharan he S2 tara jise akashgangeey centre kii parikrama karte dekha jaataa he
 This star is several light hours away from a black hole with a ~ 3
5 × 106 solar mass, so its rotation speed can be noted
 paryvekshit kaksha ke centre main kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he, jaisaa ki ek kaali vastu se ummid kii jaati he
 Semi-periodic oscillations can be used to determine the mass of a black hole
 yah takanic blike hole or uske aasapaas kii discon ke bhitari bhaag ke bich ke sambandh kaa upyog karti he, jahaan gas ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne se pehle bheetar kii ore ghumaavdaar rup main aati rahati he
 As the gas collapses inward, it transmits x-ray radiation whose intensity is less than a certain order and which repeats itself at a regular interval
 yah sanketak ardh-aavadhik dolan yaa QPO kehalaata he
 The frequency of a QPO depends on the mass of the black hole; The smaller black hole has an event horizon located close to it, so the QPO has a higher frequency
 adhik dravyaman vaale blike hole ke liye, ghatana kshitij kaaphi aage baahar kii ore hota he, isliye QPO aavriti kam hoti he
 It is now widely accepted that every galaxy, or nearly every one, has a supermassive black hole at its center
 is blike hole ke dravyaman or mejabaan akashganga ke ubhaar ke bich jo najdiki sahasambandh he, vah yah darshata he ki akashganga or blike hole ke nirmaan ke bich kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 For decades, astronomers used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies that had unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and super-powerful radio emission
 haalanki, saidhantik or paryvekshaniya adhyayan dikhaate hai ki in akashgangaon ke sakriy gangey nabhik main ati vishalkay blike hole ho sakate hai
 These AGN models have a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times heavier than the sun; a gas and dust disk called accretion disk; And two currents that are perpendicular to the accretion disk
 haalaanki, ummid kii jaati he ki ati vishalkay blike hole lagbhag sabhi AGN main paae jaayenge, sirf kuch hi akashgangaon ke nabhikon kaa dhyaan purvak adhyayan kiya gaya he is prayaas main ki centrestha ati vishalkay blike hole ummidavaaron kii pahchaan or vaastavik dravyaman kii maap, donon kii ja sake
 Examples of such notable galaxies are the Andromeda galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero galaxy
 khagolavidon kaa vishwaas he ki hamaari apni akashganga ke centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole sthit he, segitarius A* naamak kshetra main, kyonki: In 2002, observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that there are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes in spherical clusters called M15 and G1
 yah vyakhya golakaar samoohon main taron ke kaksha ke aakaar or avadhi par aadhaarit he
 But the Habbal proof is not conclusive, because a group of neutron stars can be the reason for such observations
 haal kii khojon tak, kai khagolvid sochate the ki golakaar samoohon main jatil gurutvkarshan antah-kriyaayen nae bane blike holon ko nishkasit kar dengi
 In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first and fully verified intermediate-mass black hole of our galaxy, orbiting 3 light years away from Segitarius a *
 1300 saura dravyaman vaala yah blike hole saat taron ke ek samooh ke bich main he, sambhawatah yah ek vishaal tara samooh kaa avshesh he jo akaash ganga ke centre se chhitak gaya he
 This observation confirms that supermassive black holes grow by absorption of nearby small black holes and stars
 janvari 2007 main, united kingdom ke southempton vishvavidhyalay main shodhakartaaon ne ek blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, yah sambhawatah 10 saura dravyamanon waal tha or NGC 4472 naamak ek akashganga main sthit tha, lagbhag 5

 Our galaxy contains many possible stellar-mass black holes, which are closer to us than the supermassive black holes in the Sagittarian a * region
 ye sabhi ummidavaar eks-re dwiadhari pranaaliyon ke sadsy hai jisamen adhik ghani vastu apane saathi se ek abhivruddhi discs ke madhyam se padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he
 The black holes in these pairs can range from three to more than a dozen solar masses
 ab tak awalokit taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike holon main durtam, mesiye 33 akashganga main sthit dwiadhari pranali kaa sadsy he
 Theoretically there is no minimum size for a black hole
 ek baar inaki rachana ho jane par, inamen blike hole ke gun aa jate hai
 Stephen Hawking proposed that supermassive black holes can evaporate and become more microscopic, that is, micro black holes
 vashpit hote atiprarambhik blike hole kii khoj hetu fermi gamma-re spes telescope ko prastaavit kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa prakshepan 11 june 2008 ko kiya gaya tha
 However, if microscopic black holes can be formed in other ways, such as by the impact of space rays or in colliders, this does not mean that they must certainly evaporate
 dharti par kan twarakon main blike hole ke anuroopon kaa nirmaan hone kii soochna he
 These black holes are not the same as the corresponding gravitational black holes, but they are important for examining the principles of gravity quantification
 ve majboot nabhikeey shakti ke siddhant ke anuroop hone kii vajah se blike hole kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, jinka gurutvkarshan or gurutvkarshan ke pramaatra siddhant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They are similar because both are described by string theory
 atah quark gluon plasma main aag ke gole ke gathan or vighatan kii vyakhya blike hole kii bhashaa main kii ja sakati he
 The fireball phenomenon in the relativistic heavy ion collider is very close to that of a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be predicted correctly using this analog
 aag kaa gola, haalaanki, ek gurutveey vastu nahin he
 It is not currently known whether a more energetic Large Hadron Collider will be capable of producing larger black holes with larger extra dimensions than expected, as suggested by several researchers
 adhik gaharaai se charchaa ke liye dekhen: large hadran colider main kan takaraav kii suraksha
 General relativity describes the possibility of a configuration in which two black holes are connected to each other
 is tarah ke vinyas ko aamtaur par ek varmhole kaha jaataa he
 Wormholes have inspired writers of fictional science fiction because they provide a means to quickly travel long distances, including time travel
 vyavhaar main, khagol bhautikee main aise vinyas lagbhag asambhav si baat hai, kyonki koi bhi gyaat prakriya in vastuon ke nirmaan kii anumati detii prathit nahin hoti he
 In 1971, Stephen Hawking showed that the total area of the event horizon of any collection of traditional black holes cannot be reduced even if they collide and swallow each other, that is, merge
 yah ullekhneey rup se ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam ke samaan he, jahaan kshetra entropy kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 It was believed that the black hole entropy would be zero because of the zero temperature
 yadi aisa hota to entropy-krit padaarth ke blike hole main pravesh se ushmpravagiki ke duusare niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha, parinamswaroop brahmad kii kul entropy main kami aani chahie thi
 Therefore, Jacob Beckenstein proposed that a black hole needs an entropy and it should be proportional to the event horizon
 chunki blike hole paaramparik rup se vikiran nahin chhodte he, ushmpravagiki drushtikon ek anuroop maatr prathit hota he, kyonki shunya taapmaana kaa arth he ooshmaa ke kisi bhi yoga se entropy main anant parivartanon kaa hona, jiskaa arth he anant entropy
 However, in 1974, Hawking applied quantum field theory to curved space-time near the event horizon and found that black holes emit Hawking radiation, which is a kind of thermal radiation and is associated with the impact, which implies that That they have a positive temperature
 isane blike hole gatishiltaa or ushmpravagiki ke bich ke anurupan ko bal pradaan kiya: blike hole yantriki ke pehle niyam kaa upyog karte hue, yah nishkarsh niklaa ja saktaa he ki ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii entropy uske ghatana kshitij ke kshetra kii ek chauthai hogi
 This is a universal consequence and can be applied to the entire cosmic horizon, such as in the De Sittar space field
 baad main yah suzav aayaa ki ek blike hole adhiktam entropy vaali vastu he, arthath antariksh ke kisi ek kshetra kii adhiktam sambhav entropy us kshetra main samaa sakane vaale sabase bade blike hole kii entropy hogi
 This led to the creation of holographic theory
 hawking vikiran blike hole ke vishisht taapmaana ko darshata he, jisaki gananaa uski entropy se kii ja sakati he
 The higher the temperature falls, the more massive the black hole becomes: the more energy it absorbs, the more cold it becomes
 budh grah ke lagbhag dravyaman vaale blike hole main akashiya sookshm-tarang vikiran ke santulan main taapmaana hota he 
 When heavier than this, a black hole will be cooler than background radiation and it will receive energy from the background much faster than the energy emitted through Hawking radiation, it will also cool down
 haalaanki, ek kam baari blike hole main yah prabhaav yah darshaayegaa ki blike hole kaa dravyaman samay ke saath dhire dhire vashpit ho kar ud jaayegaa, jabaki blike hole aisa karte hue or adhik garam hota jaayegaa
 While these effects are negligible for black holes that are sufficiently heavy to be formed internally, they will become increasingly important for imaginary small black holes, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate
 vastav main, chote blike hole sambhawatah drut gati se vashpit honge or antat vikiran ke ek visphot ke saath lupt ho jaayenge
 Although general relativity can be used to calculate the entropy of a black hole, this condition is in principle not satisfactory
 sankhyikeey yantriki main, entropy kaa arth ek pranali kii sookshm vinyas kii sankhya kii gananaa ke rup main samajha jaataa he jinamein samaan sookshm gun ho 
 But without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, such a calculation is not possible for a black hole
 haalaanki, string siddhant dwaara thodi aashaa jagaai gayi he, jiske anusaar blike hole kii swatantraaa kii sookshm maatra D-breance he
 By calculating the states of D-branes by the charge and energy provided, the entropy measurements of some particularly highly symmetric black holes can be obtained
 in gananaaon kii vaidhata ke kshetra ko vistrut karnaa, anusandhanon ke liye ek jari kaary kshetra he
 The so-called information loss paradox, or black hole centralization paradox, is an open question in fundamental physics
 paaramparik rup se, bhautik vigyaan ke niyam samaan hi rahenge, aage kii taraf badhen yaa peeche jaaen 
 That is, if the position and velocity of each particle of the universe is measured, we can work backwards to discover the history of the past universe at will
 luvil prameya fez spes volum ke sangrakshan kaa varnan karata he, jise "jaankaree ke sangrakshan" ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, isliye sthapit bhautikee main bhi kuch samasya avashya he
 In quantum mechanics, this coincides with an important property called centralization, which is concerned with the conservation of probability
 haalaanki, blike hole is niyam kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Under the established general relativity, this situation is subtle but clear: due to the established no-hair theorem, it can never be determined what went inside the black hole? However, when viewed from the outside, the information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into a black hole takes infinite time to reach the event horizon
 is baat par jor dena aavashyak he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke sameekaran asal main tii-samarupata kaa paalan karte hai or yah tathy ki uparokt tark saamaanya saapekshata ke aplicoshan se hi aata he, hamen thodaa satark ho janaa chahie
 This is due to the fact that it is not possible by time-symmetric theory to reach time-reversal-asymmetric conclusions, which in this case is general relativity
 rindller nirdeshaank, jo ek bahari darshak ke liye ghatana kshitij ke nikat lagu hote hai, tii-samamit hai atah "aparivartaneey" prakriya jaisi kisi cheez ke astitv ko nakaara ja saktaa he
 It is possible that the "paradox" is the result of applying the time-asymmetric limit to the time-symmetric principle, making it a variant of the logistic paradox
 duusari ore, pramaatra gurutv ke bare main vichaar, yah suzav dete hai ki vahaan keval ek simit parimit utkram maap ho sakati he jo kshitij ke paas ke antariksh se sambandhit hogi: lekin kshitij ke utkram maap main parivartan or hawking vikiran kaa utkram maap sarvatha paryaapt hota he un padaarth or urja ke sabhi utkram maapon ko apane main samahit karne ke liye jo blike hole main gir rahen hon
 However, many physicists worry that it is still not properly understood
 khaas kar, ek pramaatra str par, hawking vikiran kii pramaatra avasthaa nirdhaarit hoti he keval is baat se ki blike hole main purv main kya gir chukaa he; or itihaas ki blike hole main kya gira tha ekmaatr nirdhaarit hoti he blike hole or vikiran ke pramaatra avasthaa dwaara
 This determinism and centralization will be required
 lambey samay tak stephen hawking ne is vichaar kaa birodh kiya, apni mul 1975 kii sthiti par ve ade rahe ki hawking vikiran puri tarah se tapiya he isliye purnataya avyavasthit he, blike hole dwaara purv main nigle gaye padaarthon kii koi bhi jaankaree maujuud nahin rahati he; unhonen tark diya ki is jaankaree kaa lop ho chukaa he
 However, on 21 July 2004, he introduced a new argument, contrary to his previous argument
 is nai gananaa main, blike hole se sambandhit utkram maap nikalakar hawking vikiran main hi jaataa he
 However, it is also difficult to understand in theory until the black hole completes its evaporation
 tab tak hawking vikiran kii jaankaree or vyavastha kii praarambhik avasthaa main 1:1 tareeke se sambhddha sthapit karnaa asambhav he
 Once the black holes evaporate completely, they can be identified and the centralization in them is preserved
 jis samay hawking ne apni gananaa puri kii, yah ads / CFT sambandh ke dwaara kaaphi spasht ho chukaa tha ki blike hole kaa kshay ekaatmak tareeke se hota he
 Because in gauge theories the fire spheres, which correspond to Hawking radiation, are definitely unitary
 hawking kii nai gananaa kaa visheshgy vaigyanik samudaay dwaara moolyankan nahin kiya gaya he, kyonki unke upyog kiye tareeke anjaane or sandigdh anurupata vaale hai
 But Hawking himself expressed enough confidence in it to pay for a bet he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist John Preskill, which the media was interested in
 leonard saskind or nobel puraskaar vijeta jerard tii hooft ne yah suzav diya he ki blike hole ke chaaron or ke triayami antariksh ko ghatana kshitij ke ek dwiaiami vyavhaar dwaara purna rup se varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 They believe in this because this black hole can solve the information-loss paradox
 is vichaar ko string siddhant ke arntagat samayik kiya gaya he, tathaa holographic siddhant ke taur par janaa jaataa he

 iske alaava oxford english dictionari ne unke science fiction ko angreji bhashaa main positronic, psychohistory, tathaa robotics shabdon kaa parichay karaane kaa shrey bhi diya he
 When Asimov used the word 'robotics', he had no idea that it could be a root word; He believed that this was just a general analogue of robots, similar to terms like mechanics and hydraulics

 Campbell two days later

 Asimov sold his third story "marooned of Vesta" to 'amazing Stories' in October and was published in the March 1939 edition
 unhone apana lekhan jari rakhaa or kabhi kabhaar apni kahaniyon ko bechate bhi rahe
 In 1941, he published his 32nd story "nightfall" which is described as the most famous story ever
 1968 main america ke science fiction riters ne "nitfol" ko ab tak likhi gayi sarvshereshth science fiction kahani ke rup main chunaa
 In his short story collection called "nightfall and Other Stories", he writes, "writing 'nightfall' was the turning point in my professional career
 

 achaanak hi mujhe gambhirtha se liya jane laga or science fiction kii duniya mere astitv ke bare main jaan gayi
 With the passage of time it actually became clear that i had written an "excellent" story
 "nitfol" soshal science fiction kaa ek shuruaati udhaaharan he
 The term 'social science fiction' was used by Asimov to describe a new trend of the 1940s
 asimov tathaa heinaleen is chalan ke agrani lekhakon main se ek the jisame upkarnon tathaa antariksh kii kahaniyon se hatakar manushya kii sthiti ke bare main likhaa gaya tha
 By 1941 Asimov began writing regularly for Estounding
 1943 se lekar 1949 tak science fiction ke kshetra main unka sara prakaashan astounding ke hi madhyam se hua
 In 1942, he published the first story of the Foundation series, which tells about the collapse and rebirth of a vast interstellar empire of the future universe
 unki foundation treeyology main teen kahaniyaan shaamil he: foundation, foundation and empire, tathaa second foundation 
 is treeyology tathaa robot siries ko unka sabase prasiddh science fiction kaary mana jaataa he
 Years later, with Asimov pressurized by fans, he wrote the Foundation's Edge, two other stories in the series, and then moved back to the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation

 unki aisi hi ek laghu kahani "di bicentinal main" ke upar robin williams abhinit ek film kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 The 2004 film, I, Robot, starring Will Smith, is based on Jeff Winter's hardwired script
 isamen asimov ke vichaaron ko 'ai, robot' ke adhikaar praapt karne ke baad baad main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 It is not related to Harlan Allison's 'I, Robot' script
 harlan ne swayan asimov ke saath milakar apni script ko taiyaar kiya tha jo asimov ke mul sanskaran ke bhaavon ko darshaati he
 Asimov said that Allison's screenplay would make it possible to produce "the first truly adult, complex, and good science fiction film"
 is screenple ko 1994 main pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya gaya kyonki isapar aadhaarit film banane kii sambhaavnaaen kam hoti ja rahi thim
 In addition to films, his foundation and robot stories have inspired other related works of science fiction, many of them by well-known and established writers such as Roger mcbride Allen, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford and David Brin
 aisa lagata he ki in kaaryon ko asimov kii vidhwaa patni janet asimov kii sahmati tathaa kai baar unke anurodh karne par kiya gaya he
 In 1948 he also wrote a spoof article in chemistry "the Endochronic Properties of Reassembled Theotimoline"
 At that time, Asimov was preparing for his doctorate and the subsequent oral examination
 colombia vishvavidhyalay ke graduate moolyankan board dwaara pratikul pratikriya kiye jane ke dar se asimov ne apane sampadak se anurodh kiya ki use ek chhadam naam ke tahat chapa jaye
 haalanki, prakaashak kii galati ke kaaran yah unke naam se hi prakashit ho gaya
 During his subsequent oral examination, Asimov became quite worried because of the questions he asked
 pariksha ke ant main ek pareekshak ne muskuraate hue unase poocha, "shri asimov, kripaya hamen thiotimolin compound ke thermodynamik gunon ke bare main kuch bataaen"
 yah sunakar asimov sakapaka gaye or unhen kamare ke baahar bhej diya gaya
 After waiting for about 20 minutes, he was called back to the examination hall and greeted by addressing as "dr
 Asimov"
 1949 main pustak prakaashak dablade ke science fiction sampadak walter ai
 Breadbury accepted Asimov's unpublished novel "grow Old Along with" for publication and requested that it be increased to a full novel of 70,000 words
 The book came to market in January 1950 under the title doubleday with the title 'pebble in the Sky'
 dablade company ne 1950 ke dashak main asimov ke paanch anya mul science fiction upanyaason ke saath saath bacchon kii chah 'lucky star' upanyaason ko bhi chapa

 anya positronic robot siries ko 'di rest of di robots' naamak pustak ke rup main punarprakashit kiya gaya
 Asimov began publishing his short stories in the 1950s, with the introduction of new science fiction magazines such as Galaxy Magazine and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction
 baad main unhone 1950 ke dashak ko apane "sunahare dashak" ke rup main yaad kiya he
 Many of these stories have been included in his 'best of Anthology', such as "the Last Question", which is about mankind's ability to withstand and reverse the process of entropy
 vyaktigat rup se yah unako sarvaadhik priy thi or kaiyon ke vichaar main "nitfol" ke hi samaan thi
 Asimov wrote it in 1973: Then, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers
 Frequently someone writes to ask me if i can give them the name of a story, which they think i may have written, and tell them where to find it
 They don't remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably "the Last Question"
 This has reached the point where i recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, 'dr
 Asimov, there's a story i think you wrote, whose title i can't remember – ' at which point i interrupted to tell him it was "the Last Question" and when i described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after
 i left him convinced i could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles
 In December 1974, former Beatle member Paul mccartney contacted Asimov and asked if he could write a screenplay of a science fiction movie musical
 mecartni ke paas iske sambandh main kuch aspasht se plot or dialog the; ve rock band ke sadasyon ke bare main ek kahani chaahate the jinhen bahari duniya ke aise praaniyon ke bare main pataa chalata he jo unki nakal karte the
 The character of the band and their imitators were to be played by mccartney's crew members who were quite famous at the time
 haalanki asimov rock mujeec ke prashansak nahin the, yah vichaar unako kaaphi anokhaa laga or unhone jald hi kahani kii ek sankshipt ruparekha taiyaar kar di
 He wrote a story that was very good and dramatic according to mccartney's ideas
 haalanki unhone mecartni ke dialog kaa upyog nahin kiya or shaayad isi vajah se mecartni ne kahani ko asweekaar kar diya
 This story now exists only in the archives of Boston University
 1977 se shuruyaat karke asimov ne 'izake asimovs science fiction magazine' ko apana naam diya or uske prayek sanskaran ke sampadakeey ko likhaa
 'asimovs esef adventure magazine' tathaa 'asimovs science fiction anthology' riprint siries ko bhi kuch samay ke liye patrikaon ke rup main prakashit kiya gaya tha 
 In the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov changed his pace somewhat, reducing his volume of fiction writing
 With this, he greatly increased the volume of his writing in the field of non-fiction; The launch of Sputnik in 1957 caused a lot of concerns in the minds of people about the "science gap"
 asimov ke prakaashak is unke lekhan dwaara is antar ko paatane ke liye kaaphi utsuk the
 Meanwhile, the monthly magazine Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction invited him to continue his regular non-fiction article which was started in his collaborative bi-monthly magazine Venture Science Fiction Magazine
 yah patrika lokapriy vigyaan ko samarpit thi or asimov ko purna sampadakeey swatantraaa pradaan kii gayi thi
 The first column of F&SF came in November 1958 and continued unabated until Asimov's fatal illness
 unhone kul 399 lekh likhe
 in stambhon ko unke mukhya prakaashak dablade dwaara bich bich main ekatrit karke pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya jaataa tha
 These pillars helped establish Asimov's identity as a "great Explaner" of science
 unke pratham vyapak kaary 'di intellegent mens guide to science' ne unako apni adhikansh shaikshanik jimmedaariyon ko chhodane tathaa ek purna-kaalik swatantra lekhak banane main madad kii
 Asimov wrote several essays on social issues of his time, including "thinking About Thinking" and "science: Knock Plastic"
 asimov ke lekhan main shaamil dher sari jaankaree se prabhavit hokar court vonegut ne ek baar poocha, "sabakuch jaanakar kaisaa lagata he?" asimov ne uttar diya ki ve keval yah jaanate hai ki ek sarv-gyani ke rup main pahachaane jane par kaisaa lagata he - "kaaphi asahaj"

 apni kahaniyon ke sangrah 'slo larner' ke parichay main thomas pinchan ne sweekaar kiya ki entropy se sambandhit apane gyaan ke liye unhone asimov ke science lekhan kaa sahaara liya he
 It was a symbol of Arthur C
 Clarke's friendship and respect for Asimov that according to the so-called "asimov-clarke Treaty of Park Avenue", Asimov was to emphasize that Clarke is the world's best science fiction writer, while Clarke had to emphasize that Asimov was the best
 Hence, in the dedication of Clarke's book 'report on Planet Three', he wrote: "by the terms of the clarke-asimov Pact, the Second Best Science Writer dedicates this book to the Second Best science-fiction Author
 " Asimov coined the term spome in a paper titled "there Is No Place Like Spom" of 'atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environment'
 is paper ko pehali baar 13 sitambar 1965 ko american chemical sosayadi ke samaksh prastut kiya gaya tha
 It is about such systems which are closed in relation to matter but are open in the context of the energy that holds human life forever
 asimov ne 1942 kii apni kahani terround main robotics shabd kii shuruyaat kii
 Apart from the field of science, Asimov was also very interested in history
 1960 ke dashak se shuru karke unhone itihaas kii 14 lokapriy pustaken likhin jiname sabase ullekhneey hai, di greeks: e great adventure, di roman republic, di roman empire, di egypcians tathaa di niyar east: 10,000 iers of history 
 He published 'asimov's Guide to the Bible' in two volumes; The Old Testament in 1967 and the New Testament in 1969 and then in 1981 combined the two together to create a volume of 13,000 pages
 nakshon tathaa talikaon se bharpoor yah guide bible kii kitabon ke itihaas tathaa unhen prabhavit karne vaale raajnneetik dabaavon ke bare main krambaddh tareeke se bataane ke saath saath mahatvapurn charitron ke jivan se sambandhit jaankaree bhi pradaan karti he
 The disclosure of his interest in literature appears as an interpretation of many literary works, including Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare, Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost, and The Annotated Gulliver's Travels
 asimov ek ullekhneey mistry lekha bhi the or 'aleri queens mistry magazine' ke liye aksar likhte bhi rahe the
 He started off with writing science fiction mysteries like his Vendal Urth stories but soon jumped into the realm of writing of "pure" mysteries
 He published only two full-length novels of Mystery but wrote several stories about 'black Widowers', a group of men who once a month met for food, discussion and puzzles
 iskaa vichaar unhen 'trep door spiders' naamak samooh ke saath apane sansarg se praapt hua tha or uske sabhi mukhya charitra unke nikatatam mitron ke upar hi aadhaarit the
 In the last days of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of Limericks, beginning with 1975's 'lasherus Limericks', most of which he wrote himself
 limerics: tu gros main asimov ke 144 tathaa jon siardi ke bhi itane hi limerics shaamil hai
 He has also produced a slim volume of Sherlockian Limericks
 Asimov has featured Yiddish humor in 'azazel, the Two Centimeter Dragons'
 do pramukh yahudee charitra dinar, lunch tathaa brakefast ke samay "jorge" tathaa uske mitra azaazel ke upar chutkule sunaate hai
 Asimov's 'treasury of Humor' is a book of jokes as well as his views on the theory of humor
 asimov ke anusaar hasya kaa sabase mukhya tatv he drushtikon main achaanak aane vaala badlaav, jisame dhyaan ko mahatvapurn chizon se hataakar tuchh chizon kii ore le jaaya jaataa he
 Especially in his later years, Asimov tried to portray himself as a popular hero
 1971 main 'di sensus woomen' tathaa 'di sensus main' jaisi kaamuk guidebux kii lokapriyata ke uttar main asimov ne 'di sensus darty old main' ko "doctor 'e' " ke naam ke tahat prakashit kiya 
 Asimov published two volumes of the autobiography: 'in Memory Yet Green' and 'in Joy Still Felt'
 The third autobiography, 'I, Asimov: a Memoir', was published in April 1994
 iske upsanhaar ko unki vidhwaa patni janet dwaara unki mrityu ke ek dashak baad likhaa gaya tha
 It's been a good life, edited by Janet, is an abridged version of all three of his autobiographies
 unhone apane purv ke lekhan ke teen wolums bhi prakashit kiye hai - opes 100, opes 200 tathaa opes 300 
 In 1987, the Asimov couple co-wrote 'how to Enjoy Writing: a Book of Aid and Comfort'
 isamen unhone hatotsahit hone, dhyaan bantane, asweekaar kiye jane tathaa moti buddhi vaale sampadakon se nipatate samay sakaaratmak ravaiye tathaa utpaadakta ko kis prakaar banaaye rakhaa jaye, iske vishay main salaah di he
 This book contains many quotations, essays, jokes and many dialogues of husband and wife related to the ups and downs in the life of an author
 asimov or star treks ke nirmaataa jin rhodenberi ke bich 1960 ke dashak ke ant main star treks ke pehali baar shuru hone ke samay kaaphi gahari tathaa anokhaa sambandh sthapit ho gaya tha
 Asimov wrote a critical essay for TV Guide magazine regarding the accuracy of Star Trek scientifically
 rhodenberi ne adarpurvak iske jawaab main nijee rup se ek patr likhaa jisame ek saptahik siries ko likhte samay samay vaigyanik sateekta sambandhi simaaon ke bare main bataaya
 Asimov acknowledged his mistake and wrote in another essay for TV Guide that despite its mistakes, Star Trek is a new and intellectually challenging science fiction TV program
 iske baad un donon main itani gahari mitrataa ho gayi ki asimov ne star treks ke kai projects main salaahkaar ke taur par bhi kaam kiya
 Much of Asimov's fiction is about the relationship between robots and humans and the effects they can have on both, especially humans
 His first robot story "robbie" is about a robotic nanny
 "leni" main robocychologist susaan colvin dwaara ek aise robot ke prati matra prem kaa anubhav karne kii kshamta ke bare main bataaya gaya he jiske dimag kii positronic kshamta ek teen varsh ke bachche ke samaan he
 As robots became more modern, their tasks also became more extensive and complex
 "avidence" kii kahani ek aise pratyaashee ke ird-gird gumti he jo sambhawatah maanav vesh main ek robot he or safaltaapurvak chunaav jeet jaataa he
 In "evitable Conflict", the robots control humanity secretly as nannies of the entire human race
 baad main 'robots of don' tathaa 'robots and empire' main ek robot ek aise lau ko viksit kar letaa he jise wo jiroth lau of robotics kahata he, jiske anusaar, "koi robot maanavtaa ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaayegaa, yaa niskriyata ke kaaran maanavtaa ke upar kisi khatre ko nahin aane degaa"
 usne yah bhi faisla kar liya ki robots kii upasthiti maanavtaa kii swatantraaa kaa galaa ghont rahi he or sabase acha yahi hoga ki robot dhire dhire swayan ko hataa len
 ek gaiyr-robot, time-travel nowell 'di and of iturenity' isi prakaar ke sangharshon tathaa sankalpon ko darshaati he
 The specialty of Jeroth's Law is that it overshadows all other laws of robotics: if a robot finds itself in a situation where it has to kill a human being to protect the entire human race, the robot's positronic programming Accordingly it will become mandatory for him to do so
 Only highly advanced robots can understand this rule
 foundation series main ek vaigyanik 1000 varshon kii avadhi ke dauraan ek galactic empire kaa nirmaan karne ke liye ek ardh-gupt yojana ko lagu karata he
 This series has its own version called 'second Foundation' of Platonic Guardians to complete the plan and protect it
 jab asimov ne 1950 ke dashak main is siries ko likhnaa band kar diya, second foundation ko maanavtaa ke saumy sangrakshakon ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya tha
 When he began rewriting the series in the 1980s, he presented Caretaker Themes more clearly
 ' foundations age main gaiya naamak grih ko prastut kiya gaya jo swaabhaavik taur par gaiya hypothissis par aadhaarit tha
 Each animal, tree, and mineral of the Gaia are part of a shared consciousness that formed a super-mind that worked together for the welfare of all
 ' 'foundation and arth' main nayak prithvi kii khoj karnaa aarambh karata he kyonki uske vichaar main vahin par usko is baat kaa uttar milegaa ki 'foundations age' main usne usne yah nirnay kyon liya ki gallexia hi sahi vikalp he
 Gaia is one of Asimov's best efforts to explore the possibility of collective awareness, and in 'nemesis' he writes about a living house called Erythro where it is primarily prokaryotic and with humans, further complicating it
 Tries to establish coordination
 foundation and arth main foundation brahmand se robot kaa parichay pehali baar karavaaya gaya he
 Two of Asimov's last novels, 'prelude to the Foundation' and 'forward the Foundation', explain his behavior
 roboton ko gupt kaaryakartaaon ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he jo maanavtaa kii bhalaai ke liye kaary kar rahe hai
 Another favorite topic of his is social oppression
 The story of 'the Currents of Space' is based on a house where a unique species of plant fiber grows; The agricultural workers there are exploited by Aristocrats from a nearby home
 'di stars, like dust' main hero 'tireni' naamak ek abhimaani antartaarkeey samrajya dwaara sataae ja rahe ek grih kii madad karata he
 Harassment victims are often earthworms or robots
 'baicentanniel main' main ek robot maanav ke rup main sweekaar kiye jane ke prati logon ke purvaagrah ke khilaaf ladata he
 In 'caves of Steel', Earthlings hate the rich men of space and therefore treat robots the same way as white people do to blacks ")
 a similar situation in 'pebble in the Sky' Is depicted: the Earth is ruled by a galactic empire and its people use words like "ardi-sque, but the earth is a theocratic dictatorship" OE is enforces euthanasia of all people over 60 years of age
 ek hero kaa naam he bel arvardan jo ek ucch-vargeey galactic puratatvvid he tathaa apane purvagrahon ko dur karne ke liye drudh sankalp he
 The second hero is Joseph Schwartz, a 62-year-old 20th-century American who originally came from Europe where his people were greatly persecuted and who accidentally go back in time to the period of Ardern
 uske liye yah nirnay karnaa aavashyak he ki, kya ek aise peedit samaaj kii madad kerani chahie jo uski mrityu kii kaamana karti he
 Another favorite subject of Asimov is rational thought
 He has invented science-fiction mystery in his novels 'the Caves of Steel' and 'asimov's Mystery' and has initially told about any science or technology used in the solution while being fair to his readers
 baad main unhone gaiyr-science fiction mistries kaa bhi lekhan kiya jiname shaamil hai, 'murder at di ab' naamak nowell tathaa "blike viders" evam "union club" kii laghu kathaayen, jiname unhone isi niyam kaa paalan kiya he
 Debate / discussion has been given great importance in his fiction where the more rational, humane and more forceful side of his speech wins
 asimov ke fiction kaary kii sabase aam visheshta yah he ki unki lekhan style atyant hi saral he
 In 1980, James Gunn, a science fiction scholar and professor emeritus at the University of Kansas, wrote about 'I, Robot': gunn ne paaya ki kai jagahon par asimov ke style sthiti ke anusaar badal jaati he; unhone iske udhaaharan ke taur par "lair!" ke clymex ko udghrut kiya he
 Unique characters emerge in important places of his story: "lire!" And in addition to Susan Calvin of "evidence", Arcadi Darrell can be seen in 'second Foundation', Elijah Bailey in 'caves of Steel', and Harry Selden in the Foundation's Prequel
 asimov ne is aalochana kaa uttar apni pustak 'nemesis' kii shuruyaat main diya he: Many imaginary techniques used by Asimov in the 1940s and 1950s in the future have not yet been revealed
 udhaaharan ke liye, ve jo panchd cards yaa panchd tepe kaa prayog karne vaale bhavishya ke shaktishaalee robots tathaa computaron kaa varnan karte hai, tathaa aise ejeeniyar jo slide rules kaa prayog karte hai
 a dramatic scene in 'foundation and Empire' shows a character buying a newspaper from a vending machine
 beshak, yah aarope science fiction ke vastutah kisi bhi lekhak par lagaaya ja saktaa he or yah katai tarksangat nahin he
 In addition, there are occasional internal contradictions in their stories: for example, the Foundation Series names and dates do not always match each other
 aisi galatiyon main se kuch kaa sambhav kaaran charitron dwaara kii jane vaali galtiyaan ho saktaa he, kyonki asimov kii kahaniyon main charitra aksar apni paristhitiyon se anjaan hi rahete hai
 The reason for the other contradictions is that there is a gap of many years between Asimov starting the Foundation series and working on it again; At times, due to advancement of science, he has also been forced to change his imaginary history
 gunn tathaa petrope kii pustakon ke alaava asimov ke lekhan ke upar "saahitiyik" aalochana kaa kaaphi abhaav he 
 kowart tathaa wimar kii 'dictionari of litereri biography' main iske sambhavit kaaran die gaye hai: Objectively, a clear and direct style of writing is also a type of style according to studies conducted by both Gunn and Petroch regarding Asimov's writing
 gunn kii 1982 kii pustak asimov kii ab tak prakashit sabhi upanyaason par kaaphi gaharaai se tipanni karti he
 He does not admire all of Asimov's fiction writings, but does say so much about certain sentences in 'caves of Steel' that he is "reminiscent of Proust"
 In that novel, discussing the topic of the darkness of nightfall in future New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose "need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society"
 haalaanki ve apni applankrita gadhy style ko lekar kaaphi garv mahasoos karte the, asimov apni lambii kahaniyon ke adhyyon ko aksar betaratib tareeke se pratut karke unke kathaparak dhaanche ko ek jatil swaroop pradaan karne main bhi anand kaa anubhav karte the
 Some readers do not like this style at all, complaining that this haphazard approach increases their difficulties in vain and also adversely affects the clarity of the story
 udhaaharan ke liye, 'di gods demaselvs' kaa shuruaati ek tihaai hissaa adhyah 6 se shuru hota he or uske baad peeche kii or badhate hue kahani ko puraa karata he
 Let's start the story as late as possible
 is salaah ne asimov ko "rizan" naamak ek shuruaati robot kahani likhane main madad kii
 See 'in Memory Yet Green' for details of that time
) Petroche found that the novel was heavily damaged by the interwoven and connected flashbacks of 'the Currents of Space', so much so that only one "hardcore Asimov Fan "only can enjoy it
 asimov dwaara apni samayrekha ko todane-marodane ke pravriti ko sabase spasht rup se 'nemesis' main dekha ja saktaa he jisame kuch charitra to "vartmaan" main rahete hai jabaki kuch "bhootkaal" main
 bhootkaal vaale charitron kii kahani 15 varsh pehle shuru hoti he or dhire dhire vartmaan kii ore badhati he
 In 2002 Donald Palumbo, an English professor at the University of East Carolina, published "chaos Theory, Asimov's Foundations and Robots, and Herbert's Dunne: The Fractal Aesthetic of Epic Science Fiction"
 isamen asimov kii kahaniyon kii style kii samiksha kii gayi he or fractols tathaa keos ke saath unki tulana kii gayi he
 Palumbo found that although traditional literature lacks or is largely absent, there remains an attraction to foundations and robotic metaceries
 unke anusaar kahani kii uddeshypurna jatiltaayen uske prati ek vishesh prakaar kaa aakarshan paidaa karti hai
 In this volume, Asimov has been critically criticized so far in literary terms
 apane science fiction main saamanytah kaamuktha tathaa bahari duniya ke jivan ke abhaav ke kaaran bhi asimov kii aalochana kii jaati he
 Asimov once understood that he shies from writing about aliens because at the beginning of his career John Campbell, the editor of Astounding, rejected his science fiction story because it showed aliens better than humans i went
 unhone tay kar liya ki apni kahaniyon main aliens ke charitra ko kamjor dikhaane kii bajaay ve unke bare main likhenge hi nahin
 However, in response to these criticisms, he wrote 'the Gods Demelves' which includes aliens, sex, and the sex of aliens
 asimov ne kaha ki apane sabhi lekhan main se unako sarvaadhik garv 'di gods demaselvs' ke us hisse par he jahaan in vishyon ke bare main likhaa gaya he
 In the Hugo Award winner Novel "gold", Asimov describes an author based on himself who has a compu-drama built over a book that is primarily a photo-realistic computer animation
 director, asimov kii non-vijual lekhan style kii aalochana karte hai kyonki uske upar film bananaa mushkil kaam he, jabaki asimov samajhate hai ki ve apni baat kehane ke liye varnan kii bajaay vichaaron tathaa sanvaadon kaa sahaara lete hai
 She is also criticized by many for her lack of strong female characters in her initial work
 apane aatmakathaatmak lekhan main ve is baat ko sweekaarte hai or iskaa kaaran apni anubhavheenata ko bataate hai
 While the number of female characters in her later novels increased, there was no change in the writing style, due to which the issue became widely discussed among the readers
 udhaaharan ke liye, washington post kaa 25 agast 1985 kaa "book world" section 'robots and empire' ke bare main yah likhata he: However, it should really be noted that social issues have been given the highest importance in 'the Naked Sun'
 usame yugenics kii aad main genetic ejineering ko us samaaj ke ek abhinn ang ke rup main darshaya gaya he or pathakon ke samaksh ek aise vyakti ko prastut kiya gaya he jo kritrim vaataavaran kaa kendra bindu hone ke saath saath ek hero bhi he jo prithvi kii "saamaanya" arcology se utpann hua he
 Meanwhile, purely artificial birth is the aim of society's leaders; The main motivating force of the main female character is her sexual desire; And the whole story has been used to emphasize that excessive discipline is also not a good thing and should be avoided
 asimov ke dher saare lekhan kii samiksha karne vaale jon janakins kaa kahana he: Since its inception in 1961, the German pulp booklet Space Opera Perry Rodan has used two of Asimov's central ideas - positronic branes and starship drives for instant hyperspecial translation
 'megnas, robot fiter, namak comic book ke pratham sanskaran ke pratham prishth par asimov ke robotics ke teen niyamon ko udghrut kiya gaya he
 However, these laws have been violated many times in this series
 robotics ke teen niyam haal hi main prakashit aneme 'di time of eve' ke bhi mukhya vishay hai
 The use of androids is common and they also respect the rules but at the same time want freedom from them, but humans do not accept this
 2009 main prakashit 'estro boy' main bhi robotics ke niyamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Although Asimov's name is not mentioned, the first rule is slightly altered
 ek robot kaa nirmaan niyamon ke lagu hone se pehle kiya gaya tha or duusare ko in niyamon ke bina hi riprogram kiya gaya he, lekin adhikansh robot bahut eemaandaaree se in niyamon kaa paalan karte hai
 In the "datalore" episode of Star Trek - The Next Generation, Asimov is credited with creating the necessary positronic brain for Androids
 "anders game" naamak novellette orsan scot card kaa prakashit hone vaala pehla science fiction he
 It is based on an idea called 'battle Room' which came to the card's brain at the age of 16
 unhone haal hi main izake asimov kii foundation treeyology ko padhaa tha; isamen giban ke roman samrajya ke utthan or patan se sambandhit vichaaron ko sudur bhavishya kii ek gallexi ke ek vishaal samrajya par lagu kiya gaya tha

 kisi sanstha ke uddeshyon kii purti ke liye uski vibhinn kriyaaon main sanmjasy va talmail sthapit karnaa ‘samanvay’ kehalaata he
 It is the management function that establishes the integration of the various departments, employees and groups of an organization in such a way that it helps in accomplishing the stated objectives at the lowest cost
 ‘samanvay prabandh kaa saar he
 The essence is the name of the inner nature of an object or its important quality
 samanvay vah mahatvapurn tatv he jisase prabandh prakriya kaa nirmaan hota he
 It starts at the stage of planning itself and goes on with all the functions of organization, direction, control etc
 samanvay se hi prabandh nimna vaanchit parinaam uplabdh kar paata he jaise- Although coordination itself is an important managerial function, it is the key to all other management tasks
 anya kaaryon main isaki bhoomika is prakaar he :- In conclusion, it can be said that coordination is the essence of all management tasks
 yah sanstha ke uddeshyon, vibhageeya, kriyaaon, sadhano tathaa karmchaariyon ke vaiyaktik va samuhik prayaason ko ekarupata pradaan karke vaanchit parinaamon ko praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Some of the major definitions of sync are as follows: - 1 
 moonay va raile : “kisi saamaanya uddeshy kii purti ke liye kii jane vaali vibhinn kriyaaon main saamanjasy sthapit karne tathaa talmail banaaye rakhane ke uddeshy se samuhik prayatnon kii suvyavastha karne ko samanvayan kehete hai
 " "co-ordination is an orderly arrangement of group effort to provide unity of action in pursuit of common purpose
" 2 
 mcfarland: "coordination is the process by which a manager develops a systematic pattern of collective effort among his subordinates and establishes the unity of action to achieve the collective objective
" ” "co-ordination is the process whereby an executive develops an orderly pattern of group effect among his subordinates and secures unity of action in the pursuit of common purpose
" 3 
 kuntj va o donnelle : “samanvayan samuhik lakshyon kii prapti ke liye vyaktigat prayatnon main saamanjasy sthapit karne ke liye prabandh karata he
 " "co-ordination is the essence of management for the achievement of harmony of individual efforts towards the accomplishment of group goals
" 4
 Henry Fayol: "to facilitate and succeed in the functioning of an organization, establishing synergy in all its activities is called coordination
 ” "co-ordination is to harmonize all the activities of a concern in order to facilitate its working and its success
" 5 
 george aar terry : “samanvayan prabandh kii vah ekikaran kriya he jo sanghathanaatmak dal ke sadasyon ko sanghathan ke lakshya kii ore drudhsankalp evam purna vishwaas ke saath agrasar hone yogya banaati he
 " samanvay kii visheshtaayen is prakaar hai :- 1
 Managerial Responsibility: Coordination is a managerial responsibility
 yah kaary niyojan ke saath hi prarambh ho jaataa he
 At the time of organization formation, it is set up in a planned manner and in changing circumstances the managers keep trying to maintain it
 2 
 samuhik prayaas : samanvay kii aavashyaktaa samuhik prayaason ke sambandh main hi hoti he kyonki vyaktigat prayaas kisi duusare ke kaaryon ko kisi prakaar prabhavit nahin karte
 3
 a continuous and dynamic process: The need for some kind of coordination in the organization remains constant
 prabandh praayah ucch str kaa samanvay praapt karne kaa prayaas karata he
 4
 Integration of action: The objective of coordination is to create unity of action, so that all efforts are paved in the same direction, balanced and supplement each other
 prabandh avadharanaayen evam sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar 5
 Internal and External Coordination: Under internal co-ordination, different parts, functions and objectives of the organization have to be coordinated while external co-ordination involves coordination of the organization and its external environment
 samanvayan kii prakruti ke vishay main nimna baaten smaraneey hai :- 1
 Coordination is the responsibility of the top management of the organization
 yah uske netritv sambandhi kaary kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he jisaki vah avhelnaa nahin kar saktaa he
 2 
 Coordination is a process, not a permanent one
 prayek sanstha main kam yaa adhik maatr main samanvayan sadaa vidaymaan rahata he kintu prabandhakon ko samanvayan kaa ek ucch str praapt karne ke liye nirantar prayatnsheel rahanaa chahie
 3
 Co-ordinates are for collective efforts, not individual efforts
 4 
 samuhik lakshyon kii purti bina samanvay ke kathin hoti he
 5
 To coordinate efforts, every worker must have knowledge of the goals of the organization
 jahaan bhi alag-alag vyakti, vyakti samooh, uddeshy, kriya hogi, vahaan samanvay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It has special importance in the field of industrial organization
 kyonki yadi samay par utpaadan nahin hota yaa uski kism ghatiya ho jaati he athwa utpaadan laagat adhik aati he to sanghathan ke astitv par hi prashn chinh lag jaataa he
 a well-presented orchestra greatly influences the audience and the audience
 uske peeche safalataa kaa rahasy samanvay hota he
 Because their master coordinates the actions of different artists, only then a good program is presented
 yahi baat prabandh ke kshetron main bhi lagu hoti he
 Not only this, coordination is more important in the field of management than other areas
 kyonki is kshetra main vyaktigat evam samuhik uddeshyon, vibhinn vibhaagon, anek kriyaaon main samanvay karnaa padataa he
 Coordination in an industrial organization is required for the following reasons
 1 
 shram vibhaajan evam vishishtikaran : vartmaan yug shram vibhaajan evam vishishtikaran kaa he, jiske parinamswaroop ek mukhya kriya ko anek choti-choti upakriyaaon main vibhajit kar diya jaataa he
 And each of the subcriteria is assigned to individual individuals or groups of individuals
 jo ki us kriya ke visheshgy hote hai
 So that maximum efficiency can be availed
 jahaan ek ore ham shram vibhaajan or vishishtikaran ke laabh praapt karte hai, vahiin duusari ore samanvay kii kathinaayee kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he
 Everyone becomes proficient in the same work that he is doing continuously
 or vah apane aap ko kul kaary ke saath nahin jod paata
 Hence coordination is required to overcome this defect
 2 
 vibhinn vibhaagon kaa arth swatantra astitv : vartmaan yug bade paimaane ke utpaadan kaa yug he jahaan sanghathan kaa aakaar bahut adhik bada hota he
 An organization consists of several departments
 vikendriyakaran kii prakriya ke kaaran in vibhaagon ko anek vishyon main swatantra nirnay lene kaa adhikaar he
 Due to this freedom, such a situation also arises that decisions taken by one department do not align with the actions, interests and policies of other departments and the interests of the organization
 atah samanvay kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 3
 Humanitarian elements in the organization: Every organization has working people and managers have to take work from these employees
 maanav swabhaav prakritik rup se hi bada parivartansheel, chanchal evam visham he, jo ki anek baar sanghathanaatmak uddeshyon se hatakar bhi kaary karne lag jaataa he
 Which has an impact on his actions
 atah vahaan samanvay kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Another reason for the need for coordination is that different powers are delegated at different levels in coordination
 jin vyaktiyon ko kam adhikaar milte hai, unka anek baar apane ucch adhikariyon se manmutav chalata he
 Hence, coordination is also required to overcome this
 kuch log samanvay tathaa sahyog ko ek duusare kaa paryaayavachi maanate he
 But it is very important to clarify here that coordination is a system while cooperation is a method
 sahyog kaa arth he ek saamaanya uddeshy ke liye aichhik rup se ek duusare ke saath mil kar kaary karnaa, jabaki samanvay ke antargat ek adhikari vibhinn vyaktiyon evam vibhaagon ke kaaryo main uchit prayaas karke samanvay sthapit karata he jisase ki nirdhaarit lakshyon evam uddeshyon ko praapt kiya ja sake
 Cooperation is voluntary of the person, they cannot be forced to do it, but under coordination, the officer makes many efforts to establish coordination and sociability in the actions of individuals and departments
 samanvay adhikashtah uchit adhikariyon dwaara nishchit kaaryakramon ke anusaar prarambh se hi sthapit kiya jaataa he, jabaki sahyog bhinn bhinn vyaktiyo dwaara swayan apni ichha se paraspar sambandhon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Coordination is a long-term process, which begins with planning and goes on to control
 sahyog ek asthaayee prakriya he jo ki vyaktiyon ke paraspar vichaaron, sambandhon tathaa sanghathan ke vaataavaran par nirbhar karti he
 Under coordination, only individuals try to combine their efforts with each other's efforts
 yah baat spasht ho jaati he ki samanvay or sahyog purna rup se alag-alag nahin he
 One of the objectives of coordination is to establish cooperation
 kuch vidwaan samanvay ko prabandh kaa ek pruthak kaary maanate he, lekin kuch prabandh visheshgy ise prabandh kaa alag kaary nahin maanate
 Fayol and Brecht consider coordination to be a separate function of management
 iske vipareet kuntj tathaa o-donnelle jo aadhunik vidwaan he samanvay ko prabandh kaa alag kaary nahin maanate
 He says that coordination is related to the process of management in such a way that we cannot call it a separate action
 wiliam sprigal ne prabandh ko samanvay kii shakti kaha he
 Prof
 Hymen says that no matter of management, be it planning or control, organization, appointment or ordering, coordination is required
 yah baat sahi bhi he
 For example, while planning, the plans of different departments and other sub-schemes have to be coordinated with each other in such a way that it becomes a part of the plan of the entire institution
 yojana ko alag karne ke liye hamen anek kaarykram chalaane padate he
 The time sequence and time usage of these programs have to be coordinated in such a way that the work of the entire organization continues to work properly
 prabandhakon ko uplabdh sadhano tathaa sanstha ke uddeshyon ke bich bhi samanvay sthapit karnaa padataa he
 If the means are small then sufficient targets cannot be set
 yojanaon ko thik prakaas se lagu karne ke liye ek sanghathan aavashyak hota he
 In fact, we form organizations only to coordinate the work of various individuals
 isliye sanghathan samanvay kaa aadhaar he
 After forming the organization, various persons have to be appointed and while making the appointment one has to take care of the necessary qualifications, employee numbers etc
 samanvay kaa arth dekh-rekh kii us prakriya se he jo do yaa do se adhik vyaktiyo ke kaaryo kii dekh-rekh karte he tathaa unka aapas main talmail bithaate he
 If an employee does not work properly, then the technique of motivation is resorted to
 prabandh kaa sabase antim kaary niyantran bhi samanvay ke saath judaa hua he
 In other words, the need for control arises to coordinate whether we see whether every department and every employee is doing the prescribed work according to the predetermined plan
 yadi koi kami pai jaati he to use dur karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In the words of Mary Parkette Follett- samanvay ke siddhanth ke bare main mul vichaar meri parket ke dwaara die gaye
 He has given four basic principles of coordination and this principle is different from the technique of coordination
 in siddhanton kaa varnan sankshep main nimna prakaar he- 1
 Use from the beginning - the work of coordination should be started from the initial system of management
 yadi prarambh se hi ham samanvay kriya ko alag se nahin karenge to baad main samanvay sthapit karnaa kathin hoga or anutpaadak bhi hoga
 For example, the manager of an organization gives orders to buy goods, but later the financial manager shows that it will be very difficult to coordinate if the organization does not have funds for it
 isi prakaar se yadi vikray prabandhak apane stock ke bare main bina jane hi maal bechney kaa aadesh sweekaar karata he to kisi bhi dasha main maal kii purti samay par nahin kii ja sakati
 Therefore, coordination should be established at the time of planning and before starting the work
 2 
 pratyaksh sampark - samanvay kaa doosraa siddhanth he ki sampoorn vyaktiyo ke saath pratyaksh sampark hona chahie
 Coordination can be established soon by having direct contact
 isse aapasi samaj evam sahyog ko badhaava miltaa he or lalaphitaashahee janm nahin paati
 As such, the success of coordination depends on clear and expeditious handling and it is necessary to have direct contact, so that there is no confusion between two persons and departments
 3 
 nirantarataa - samanvay ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki yah ek nirantar chalati rahane vaali prakriya he
 If it is left in the middle, many problems can arise
 atah yah aavashyak he ki sanstha ke uddeshyon evam prayatnon evam karmchaariyon, pragati evam lakshyon aadi ke bich nirantar samanvay rahanaa chahie
 Sometimes some special coordination committees are formed to solve some important problems of coordination
 lekin isse samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 It is necessary that the work of coordination continues
 4 
 parasparata - vibhinn tatv jab ek saath prayog kiye jate he to ek-duusare ko prabhavit karte hai tathaa ek duusare se jude rahete he
 Considering this fact, there is a need for integration in the interests and interests of all the individuals, and in order to make integration, mutual relations are coordinated keeping in mind
 udhaaharan ke liye vikray, utpaadan, vitt or karmchaaree sabhi vibhaag ek-duusare se jude hote he tathaa ek-duusare par nirbhar hote he
 If we want to increase production, additional finance and staff will be required and the sales management will have to sell more
 yadi ham kuch karmchaario ko nikaalte he to ek or hamen vitt kii kuch bachat hogi lekin duusari or utpaadan kam hone kaa bhay rahegaa
 Therefore, it becomes clear that all people and work depend on each other
 samanvay ke pramukh thug nimna prakaar he- 1
 Coordination by order chain - According to the organization principle, every senior officer has the right to order his subordinates
 atah adhinsth karmchaariyon ke kaary unke varishtho dwaara samanvit kiye jate rahe hai
 Thus the order is coordinated by series
 2 
 vaiyaktik netritv dwaara samanvayan - bairanch ke matanusaar samanvay ek maanviya prakriya hoti he or prabandhak apane vaiyaktik aacharan dwaara isaki sthapana karata he
 What is needed for successful leadership is also needed for successful coordination
 3 
 samitiyon dwaara samanvayan - kuch samitiyaan keval anushaasan karne vaali hoti hai or kuch nirnay lene vaali
 Discipline or decision is based on majority
 ucchadhikari samanvay kii sthapana ke liye vibhinn pramukhon kii ek samiti bana detaa he
 This gives him an opportunity to become aware of all kinds of perspectives and as a result, the establishment of the institution becomes smooth
 4 
 swa-samanvay dwaara samanvayan - praayah vyavsaayik sansthaaon main vibhaag pramukh or anya adhikari apane-apane kshetra main samanvay sthapit karne kaa kaary karte hai
 But it is difficult to fulfill its collective objectives
 yah bhi aavashyak he ki prayek adhikari apane-apane kaaryakshetra main samanvay rakhane ke atirikt yah bhi dekhe ki anya adhikariyon ke kriyakalapon par bura prabhaav na pade
 5
 Coordination by General Staff - In the case of self-coordination, each officer opposes making convenient changes in his scheme as compared to other officers and feels that he is being given less importance than some other officers
 is dosha ko dur karne hetu badi sansthaaon main saamaanya sahaayakon kaa prayog hone laga he
 The general department gets information from all the departments of the institution
 apni vishisht sthiti ke kaaran yah vibhaag yah nishchit kar saktaa he ki kis vibhaag kii koun-si soochna anya vibhaag yaa vibhaagon ke liye laabhprad ho sakati he
 Thus, coordination can also be done by the general department
 6 
 vishisht samanvayakartaaon dwaara samanvayan - kuch sansthaaon main vyavsaay ke vibhinn pakshon ne samanvay sthapit karne ke liye vishisht samanvayakartaaon kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 For example, there may be a specific person to coordinate between the Spinning and Weaving Departments whose only job is to bring the progress of the Spinning Department to the Weaving Department, so as to coordinate the activities of the two
 7 
 paryvekshan dwaara samanvayan - paryvekshan prarambh se hi samanvayan kaa ek mahatvapurn saadhan samajha jaataa he
 The supervisor's main duties are to supervise and coordinate the actions of his subordinates
 8 
 vyaktigat sampark dwaara samanvayan - vyaktigat sampark ke madhyam se sanstha ke uddeshyon, uske vidhi kriyakalapon evam niyantran main samanvay sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Personal contact is a lifeline for the prevention of misconceptions
 9 
 niyojan dwaara samanvayan - niyojan kaa pramukh uddeshy lakshyon, nitiyon va sadhano main saamanjasy sthapit karnaa hota he
 Thus planning is an important technique of self-coordination
 10
 likhit sampreshan dwaara samanvayan - is takanic kaa upyog vyaktigat sampark ke poorak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Letters, bulletins, magazines, telegrams, telephones, radios, cinema etc
 are examples of this
 11 
 bajet dwaara samanvayan - bajaton ke aadhaar par hi vibhinn vibhaag apane kriyalap sanchalit karte hai
 The master budget is the controller and coordinator of all
 is prakaar niyantran kii yuktiyaan vastav main samanvay kii takanic kahi ja sakati he
 12
 Co-ordination by organization - According to davadam, organization is the best means to establish co-ordination in various activities of undertaking
 13
 anya takneekein - is sheershak ke antargat nimna kaa samavesh kiya ja saktaa he- The 1980 European Cup final was a football match held at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, Madrid on 28 May 1980, which saw England's Nottingham Forest 1-0 beat Hamburg, Germany
 21 wein minute main, jon robertson nottingham forest waapas karne vaali peeth europea cap khitaab dene ke liye, khel kaa hi lakshya ke liye hamberg keeper rudolph kargus pichley ek shot nichoda
 jeet nottingham forest apane gharelu lig se europea cap adhik baar jeeta tha pehla club ban gaya tha
 Coffee - is a popular beverage, made from roasted seeds of the coffee tree
 coffee main caffin hone ke kaaran vah halke uddipak sa prabhaav daalati he
 Scientists have no definite opinion about it
 jahaan ek ore kaha jaataa he ki coffee se shukranuon kii sakriyata badhati he vahiin duusari ore kuch adhyayanon main yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki adhik coffee pine se matibhram bhi ho saktaa he
 It is believed that the coffee plant was first discovered in 600 AD in the Kafa province of Ethiopia
 ek dantakatha ke anusaar ek alsabhari dopaher ko yah niraala paudha kaldi naamak ithiopian gadriye kii nazar main tab aayaa, jab usne apane pashuon ke vyavhaar main achaanak chusti or furti dekhi
 All the sheep were grazing the dark red seeds of a plant, after which they looked more energetic and joyful than before
 kaldi ne swayan bhi kuch beej khaakar dekhe or jald hi use bhi apni bhedon kii tarah apane bheetar ek urja or shakti kaa anubhav hua
 There are many types of coffee

 namaste yaa namaskara mukhyatah hinduon or bharatiyon dwaara ek duusare se milane par abhivadan or vinamrata pradarshit karne hetu prayukt shabd he
 This sense means that there is a divine consciousness and light in the heart of all human beings, which is situated in the Anahata Chakra
 yah shabd sanskrit ke namas shabd se niklaa he
 This Bhavamudra means the gratitude of one soul to another
 dainandin jivan main namaste shabd kaa prayog kisi se milane hai yaa vidaa lete samay shubhakamanaayen pradarshit karne yaa abhivadan karne hetu kiya jaataa he
 In addition to Namaste, use the word Namaskar and Pranam
 sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se isaki utpatti is prakaar he- namaste= namah+te
 That means hello to you
 sanskrit main pranaam yaa aadar ke liye 'namah' avyay prayukt hota he, jaise- "suryaay namah" 
 Similarly here, "chaturthi" of Yushmad is used for "I salute you"
 vaise "tumhaare liye" ke liye sanskrit kaa saamaanya prayog "tubhyan" he, parantu usee kaa vaikalpik, sankshipt rup "te" bhi bahut prayukt hota he, yahan vahi prayukt hua he
 So Namaste literally means hello to you
 ise "tumko pranaam" yaa "tumhen pranaam" bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 But its Sanskrit form always remains "namah for you", because Namah Avayya always comes with Chaturthi Vibhakti, such is the rule
 namaste karne ke liye, dono haathon ko anahath chak par rakhaa jaataa he, ankhen band kii jaati hai or sir ko jhukaaya jaataa he
 other than this namaste shabd ab vishwavyaapee ho gaya he
 Its meaning and meaning are understood and used in most places of the world
 fishan ke taur par bhi kai jagah namaste bolne kaa rivaaj he
 Although "namaste" in the West is spoken in combination with Bhavamudra, in India it is believed that Bhavamudra means Namaste and therefore, it is not considered necessary to speak the word
 haathon ko hriday chakra par laakar divine prem kaa bahaav hota he
 Tilting the head and closing the eyes means surrendering oneself to the Lord seated in the heart
 gahare dhyaan main doobane ke liye bhi swayan ko namaste kiya ja saktaa he; jab yah kisi or ke saath kiya jaae to yah ek sundar or teevr dhyaan hota he
 When a teacher and a student say hello to each other, two people come to each other energetically at a connected point devoid of time and space and are free from ego
 yadi yah hriday kii gahari bhaavana se man ko samarpit karke kiya jaae to do atmaaon ke madhya ek athmiya sambandh banataa he
 Ideally, Namaste should be done at the beginning and end of the class
 aamtaur par yah kaksha kii samaapti par kiya jaataa he ktonki tab man kam sakriy hota he or kamare kii urja adhik shant hoti he
 The teacher greets his students and his teachers by saying hello and welcomes his students to be equally knowledgeable and that truth may flow
