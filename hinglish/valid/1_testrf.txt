 This type of influenza also affects humans and birds
 shookar influenza vishaanu kaa duniya bhar ke suaro main paaya janaa aam he
 The transmission of this virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always cause human influenza, often producing only antibodies against it in the blood
 yadi iskaa sancharan, maanav influenza kaa kaaran banataa he, tab ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Individuals who are regularly exposed to pigs are at greater risk of infection with the flu
 yadi ek sankramit suar kaa maance thik se pakaaya jaye to iske seven se sankraman kaa koi khatra nahin hota
 In the mid-20th century, it became possible to identify subtypes of influenza, which led to an accurate diagnosis of its transmission in humans
 tab se aise keval 50 sancharanon kii pushti kii gai he
 These strains of swine influenza rarely transmit from one human to another

 The strains found in humans and pigs within influenza a and influenza c differ, although re-segregation has resulted in large-scale gene transfer across strains whether present in pigs, birds, or human species
 influenza si vishaanu, maanav or siiron donon ko sankramit karata he lekin iskaa sankraman pakshiyon main nahin hota
 In the past too, it has been transmitted between pigs and humans

 The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India, the Kamboja dynasty

 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya

 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture

 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives

 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter

 According to the 'swayambhuva Shastra' proclaimed by him, the son and daughter have equal rights in the property of the father
 inako dharamshastra kaa or prachetas manu arthshaastra kaa acharya mana jaataa he
 Manusmriti had associated Sanatana Dharma with the code of conduct

 unamem se ek manu tha, duusari shatarupa thi
 Swayambhuva Manu received five children from Shatarupa: two sons - Priyabrata, Uttanapada and three girls - Aakuti, Devahuti and maternity
 manu ne brahma se poocha ki ve praja ke nivas ke liye koun-sa sthaan thik samajhate hai? brahma ne chintan aarambh kiya, at: jal main dubi hui prithvi ko jal ke upar laane kaa kaary vishnu ne kiya
 Manu has been mentioned since the Rigvedic period as the original originator of human creation and the father-father of all mankind
 inhen 'adipurush' bhi kaha gaya he
 Initially the existence of Manu and Yama was integral
 baad main manu ko jivit manushyon kaa or yama ko duusare lok main, mrit manushyon kaa adipurush mana gaya
 According to the Shatapatha Brahmin, a fish spoke to Manu about the catastrophe and later the creation took place
 anyatra ye viraat ke putr bataae gaye hai jinase prajapatiyon kii utpatti hui
 Matsya Purana considers Manu to be the creator of 'manusmriti' and a scripture promoter
 puraanon ke anusaar manu chaudaa hue hai
 Manu is considered a historical figure in the Vedic codes
 ye sarvapratham maanav tha jo maanav jati ke pita tathaa sabhi kshetron main maanav jati ke path pradarshak sweekrut hai
 Manu is the hero of the legend of the Vedic period Jalaplavan
 manu ko vivaswan yaa vaiwaswath, vivaswant kaa putr; saavarni evam saanvarni sanvaran kaa vanshaj) kehete hai
 The first name is mythological, while the second name is historical

 All the chemical substances in nature are generally found in solids, liquids and gases and plasma - these four states
 drav or gas pravaahit ho sakate hai, kintu thos pravaahit nahin hota
 In flexible solids, stress is produced by distorting the volume or shape
 alp vikrutiyon ke liye vikruti or pratibal paraspar samaanupati hote hai
 Due to this property, flexible solids have the ability to handle external forces up to a certain value
 pravaah kaa gun hone ke kaaran dravon or gaison ko taral padaarth kaha jaataa he
 These materials are unable to handle the shearing forces and due to the effect of gravity, they flow and take shape of the vessel in which they are kept
 thos or taral kaa yantric bhed bahut spasht nahin he
 Many substances, particularly the mechanical properties of high-grade polymers, are intermediate in properties of the viscous liquid and flexible solids
 prayek padaarth ke liye ek aisa kranthik taap paaya jaataa he, jisase adhik hone par padaarth keval taral avasthaa main rah saktaa he
 At critical temperature, there is no significant difference between the fluid and gas state of matter
 isse neeche ke prayek taap par drav ke saath uskaa kuch vaashp bhi upasthit rahata he or is vaashp kaa kuch nishchit dabaav bhi hota he
 This pressure is called vapor pressure
 prayek taap par vaashp dabaav kaa adhiktam maan nishchit hota he
 If this maximum pressure is equal to or greater than the summed-vapor-pressure, the fluid remains stable
 yadi upree dabaav drav ke sampruktavashp-dabaav se kam ho, to drav asthaayee hota he
 The combined-vapor-pressure increases with the increase of heat
 jis taap par drav kaa samprukt-vaashp-dabaav bahari vaataavaran ke dabaav ke baraabar ho jaataa he, usapar drav bahut teji se vashpit hone lagata he
 This temperature is called the boiling point of the fluid
 yadi bahari dabaav sarvatha sthaayee ho to kvathanank se neeche drav sthaayee rahata he
 On reaching the boiling point it starts to boil
 is dasha main yah taap kaa shoshan karke drav avasthaa se gas avasthaa main parivartit hone lagata he
 The number of calories of heat required to convert the unit mass of the fluid from the liquid to fully gas at the boiling point is called the latent heat of the evaporation of the fluid
 vibhinn drav padaarthon ke liye iskaa maan bhinn hota he
 Both solid and liquid forms can be found simultaneously at a certain temperature at a fixed pressure
 yah taap drav kaa himbindu yaa thos kaa dravnank kehalaata he
 The amount of heat required to convert the unit mass of a substance from solid to fully liquid at the euthanasia is called latent heat of the solid's melting
 acristali padaarthon ke liye koi niyat galnaank nahin paaya jaataa
 They gradually become soft on heating and then come to a fluid state
 kaanch tathaa kaanch jaise anya padaarth isi prakaar kaa vyavhaar karte hai
 The three states of each material can exist simultaneously at a fixed temperature and constant pressure
 dabaav or taap ke bich khichein gaye aarekh main ye niyat taap or dabaav ek bindu dwaara pradarshit kiye jate hai
 This point is called the triad of fluid
 trik vindu kii apeksha nimna daabon par drav asthaayee rahata he
 If a solid is heated at a lower pressure than the triple point, it becomes vapor without becoming liquid, that is, it becomes vertical
 drav ke mukt tal main, jo us drav ke vaashp yaa saamaanya vaayu ke sampark main rahata he, ek vishesh gun paaya jaataa he, jiske kaaran yah tal tani hui maheen jhilli jaisaa vyavhaar karata he
 This property is called surface tension
 prishth tanaav ke kaaran drav ke prishth kaa kshetrafal yathasambhav nunatam hota he
 The lowest area for a given volume is of a sphere
 at: aisi sthitiyon main jab ki bahari bal naganya maane ja sakate hon drav kii boonde gol hoti hai
 When a fluid comes in contact with a solid, or any other intracellular fluid, stress also occurs on the contact plane
 saadhaarant: koi bhi padaarth keval ek hi prakaar ke drav rup main praapt hota he, kintu iske kuch apwaad bhi milte hai, jaise helium gas ko dravit karke do prakaar ke helium drav praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In the same way, para-azoxy-anisole can be obtained in the form of anisotropic liquid, in the crystalline state and also as a normal fluid
 prayek dravya ke anu ek duusare ko aakarshith kiye rahete hai
 This attraction is called interstitial attraction
 isi ke kaaran kisi dravya ke anu ekatra rahete hai
 There is also a repulsion force on the molecules of matter
 yah bal anuon ko ek duusare ke ati nikat aane se roktaa he
 These forces prevail between the molecules of a solid
 dravon main inke maan alp or gaison main lagbhag naganya hote hai
 The characteristic feature of a crystalline solid is that it has a well-organized arrangement of molecules in the near range and the far range
 kuch anu aapas main milakar chote chote gut bana lete hai
 These groups have the same internal structure
 inhen ekackoshika kehete hai
 This is called the system of close range
 dur paraas kii vyavastha kaa yah arth he ki crystalia thos kii ekackoshikaaye bhi vishesh dhang se vyavasthit rahati hai, arthath ekackoshika kii vyavastha manamaani nahin varan aavarti hoti he
 The main difference between liquid and solid is that there is no remote arrangement in the liquid
 nikataparaas vyavastha kuch had tak bani rah sakati he, jisase drav main bhi prayek anu ke chaaron ore sthit anuon kii sankhya baraabar hoti he
 The presence of such close range arrangement has been proved by scientists by experiments of X-ray diffraction

 foular ne eks-kiran vivartan kaa adhyayan kiya he or uski sankhya kaa phurye vishleshan karke is tathy ko pratipaadit kiya he
 Many theoretical efforts have been made to calculate the critical point, viscosity and other properties of a fluid
 pehle ke adhyayanon ke adhiktar lenard jones vibhav kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 The fluid theory of fluids is a relatively new theory
 bahut se drav vidyucchhuchaalak hai
 The reason for their conductivity is that they have independent electrons
 drav lavenon kii vidyucchalakata unke ynikaran par nirbhar karti he
 Other fluids can be divided into two main parts
 jo drav vidyunmay vastu kii ore-aakarshith hote hai, unhen dhruviya or jo aakarshith nahin hote unhen adhruviya kaha jaataa he
 The reality is that the polar fluids molecule has some dipole-momenta permanently, but the molecules of polar fluids do not
 benzene adhruviya drav he
 The polarity of polar fluids is found between 1 and 3
 inkaa drishy kshetreey vartanaank inke radio aavritiya paravaidyuthank ke vargamul ke baraabar hota he
 The polarity of polar fluids is about 10 to 100 times higher than the polarity of polar fluids, but they are roughly the same
 drav samaanyat: samdaishik hote hai
 The spectrum of fluids is very similar to the gaseous molecular spectrum of these substances

 At the time of the invasion of the Greek Emperor Alexander, the kingdom of Malavgan was mainly in the Doab of Ravi and Chinav
 kshudrakon kaa rajya malwon ke rajya se laga hua tha
 Therefore, the Malavas had established a strong unity with the asteroids
 donon senaaon ne veerta or dridhtaa ke saath datakar sikandar kaa saamana kiya
 According to the Greek historian Arrian, among the Indian castes residing in the Punjab, the Malavs and the Nishadars were the most numerous and the most warlike

 katyayan or patjali ne bhi kshudrak maalavi sena kaa ullekh kiya he
 After this, there is no mention of asteroids, which leads to the presumption that the 'malav-nastrakya Ekya' established during the time of Alexander's invasion grew more and more at the end, and finally the Asteroids became fully incorporated into the Malavas

 Although later the Shakas re-established their suzerainty, but at the beginning of the third century under the leadership of Shri Som, they again declared independence of the Republic of Malwa
 malvagan carcot nagar se dakshin main us saare pradesh par fail gaye, jo aage chalakar unheen ke naam se malwa pradesh kahalaane laga
 In this republic of Malavas, the governance was in the hands of their chosen chief

 But the republican tradition prevailed among them
 malwon ke kai sikke praapt hue hai
 They were often small

 On the first type of coins, the Malavas inscribed the letters Malvanan Jai (and Malavganasya Jai) in Brahmi script in memory of their important victory

 In the first half of the fourth century CE, when Samudragupta established his vast empire by digging, he also subjugated the Republic of Malavas, the internal independence of this republic of Malavas must have remained for some time
 parantu gupt samrajya ke patan kaal main barbar hunon ke akraman pravaah main malvagan kaa samoochaa pradesh bhi nimagn ho gaya
 The Malavas gave unity and important traditions to the Malwa region
 yah pradesh pehle do vibhinn bhaagon main banta hua tha, pashchimi bhaag avantika kshetra kehalaata tha or purvi bhaag aakar athwa dasharn naam se sugyaat tha
 Both of them now became integral by joining Malwa region
