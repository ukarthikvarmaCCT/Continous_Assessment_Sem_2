 purv mukhyamantri, uttar pradesh Bioremediation, by definition, is a process in which microorganisms, such as bacteria or their enzymes, attempt to restore a contaminated environment back to its original state
 jaivopachaaran kaa upyog, kuch vishisht sandupakon jaise ki chlorinayus kitnashak jinka ksharan jeevanuon dwaara hota he, yaa phir saamaanya rup se tel failaav kii sthiti main jahaan kachche tel ke apghaton ke liye kai takneekon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jisamen, urvarkon kaa prayog kar jeevanuon dwaara kachche tel ke apghaton kii prakriya ko tej karnaa shaamil he, main kiya jaataa he
 In simple terms, bioremediation is a method in which a polluted environment is naturally given its basic form by using microorganisms
 kisi apradooshit paryaavaran main jeevanu, kavak, protist or anya sookshmjeev lagaataar carbonic padaarthon ke apghaton main lage rahete hai
 When this environment is polluted by an organic pollutant, such as crude oil, some microorganisms die, but some other microorganisms that have the ability to decompose this external pollutant also survive
 jaivopachaaran ke dwaara in bache hue sookshmjivon kii sankhya main urvarak, oxigen tathaa anya anukool paristhitiyaan pradaan kar teji se vruddhi kii jaati he
 Due to favorable conditions, the number of these microorganisms increases rapidly resulting in rapid decomposition of organic pollutants from outside
 tel risaav ke adhiktar maamalon se nipatane ke liye to jaivopachaaran kii vidhi hi kaam main laai jaati he
 One of two methods is used to restore a polluted environment back to its original state
 upar diye gayi udhaaharan main, pehle to batch gayi sookshmjivon kii sankhya main vruddhi ke upaay kiye jate hai or doosraa vishesh sookshmjeev baahar se laakar is paryaavaran main pravisht karaaye jate hai taaki, pradooshkon kaa apghaton teevr gati se ho
 
 jaivopachaaran kuch prakaar ke pradooshanon se nipatane ke liye to ek acchhee ranneeti he, par yah har prakaar ke pradooshan ke upachaar main ek kargar upaay nahin he
 In places where the main pollutants are chemicals that are toxic to almost all types of microorganisms, it is not possible to get rid of pollution by bioremediation
 in rasayanon main vibhinn dhaatuyen jaise ki cadmium or sisa or lavan jaise ki sodium chloride shaamil hai
 In spite of all this, bioremediation provides a good way to tackle pollution by accelerating the process of naturally occurring decomposition
 sthaan or pradooshako ke anusaar jaivopachaaran anya vaikalpik upayon jaise ki jalaane yaa pradooshit padaarthon dwaara nichle sthanon kii bharaai, kii tulana main ek surakshit or sasta upaay sabit hota he
 By this, pollution can be treated at the polluted place and there is no need to dig out the soil or sediment or pump it out by pumping water

 Chauth's entire history revolves around the Chautha Mata Shakti Peetha, this village has a grand temple of Chauth Bhawani which is situated at an altitude of 1100 feet above the Aravali Shakti Giri mountain range, this temple was founded by Maharaja Bhim Singh Chauhan
 In 1451, on the mountain of Barwada
 vartmaan chouth kaa barwada ko pracheen kaal main "barbada" naam se janaa jaataa tha jo ki ranthambhore samrajya kaa hi ek hissaa rahaa he, is kshetra ke pramukh shaskaon main bijalsinh evam bhimsingh chouhan pramukh rahe hai
 Charu and Pachala near Barwada region, which have become villages in the present time, were the main places of stay of tribals in the dense forests in ancient times
 chouth mata kii pratham pratimaaka anumaan churu jangalon ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 According to a legend, in ancient times, there was the practice of a terrible fire in the Charu forests, which led to the destruction of Darud Bhairo
 is pratimaa ke chamatkaaron ko dekhakar jangal ke adivaasiyon ko pratimaa ke prati lagaav ho gaya or unhone apane kul ke aadhaar par chaur mata ke naam se isaki puja karne lage, baad me chaur mata kaa naam dhire dhire churu mata evam aage chalakar yahi naam apbhransh hokar chouth mata ho gaya
 It is known that this mother was first worshiped by the people of the Chaura ie Kanjar caste as her Kuldevi, later the tribals also considered it as their goddess Aradhya who belonged to the Meena tribe
 yahi kaaran rahaa he ki chouth mata ko adivaasiyon meenaon evam conjaron kii kuladevi ke rup main janaa jane laga
 Years later, the statue of Chauth Mata suddenly vanished from the formidable forests of Charu, the atom of which is very difficult to say correctly, but years later the same statue began to appear in the dream of Maharaja Bhim Singh Chauhan in the foothills of Barwara region, but Bhimsinh Chauhan Has ignored it
 kahan jaataa he ki ek baar maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ko raat main swapn aayaa ki shikaar khilne kii parampara ko main bhuulataa ja rahaa hoon, isi swapn kii vajah se maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ne shikaar khilne jane kaa nishchay kiya, maharaja bhimsingh chouhan barwada se sandhya ke vakt jane kaa nishchay kiya evam shikaar karne kii taiyaari karne lage
 The queen of Bhimsingh Chauhan was named Ratnavali
 kaha jaataa he ki ratnavali ne raja bhimsingh chouhan ko shikaar par nahin jane ke liye bahut manaa kiya, magar bhimsingh ne yah kahkar baat ko taal diya ki "chouhan ek baar savaar hone ke baad shikaar karke hi neeche utarate hai"
 Thus, ignoring the queen's words, Bhimsingh Chauhan along with his soldiers traveled towards the dense forests
 shaam kaa samay tha lekin bhimsingh chouhan jangalon main shikaar kii khoj hetu badhate hi rahe, yakayek maharaja bhimsingh chouhan kii nazar ek mrug par padi or unhone mrug kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya, sainik bhi raja ke saath badhane lage, lekin jangalon main raat ho jane ke kaaran sabhi sainik aapas main ek duusare se bhatak gaye
 Maharaja Bhimsingh decided to chase the deer by aiming for the voice as it became night and proceeded towards the deer
 mrug dhire dhire bhimsingh chouhan kii najaron se ojhal ho gaya
 By the time all the king's soldiers had lost their way from the king
 bhimsingh chouhan ne chaaron taraf nazren daudai magar uske paas koi bhi sainik nahin rahaa or pani ke shrout ko khojane lage kyonki unako pyaas bahut sataane lagi thi
 Even after a lot of effort, when water was not available, Bhimsingh Chauhan fainted and fell into the forests
 bhimsingh ko swapn main pachaalaa talahati main vahi pratimaa dikhne lagi
 Then suddenly it started raining fiercely and the thunder started thundering and lightning started to blow, when the rage broke due to the rain of the king, the king sees that there was water all around, the king drank the water first and saw a girl in the dark night The girl was seen playing as a bright bright hair like the sun herself
 Bhim Singh Chauhan was a little frightened to see that girl and said, o Bala, what are you doing alone in this forest? The Where is your parents, the young girl listening to the king started laughing and said in a taut voice, o Rajan, tell me whether your thirst is quenched or not, by saying so much, Bhagwati came in her true form, as soon as the king's mother came Fell at the feet and said, o Adishakti Mahamaya, i do not want anything from you, if you are happy with me, then you can always live in our area! Bhagwati Shivamaya became impassioned by saying that Raja Bhim Singh Chauhan had said that mother will fulfill her wish
 usee chouth mata kii pratimaa ko lekar raja barwada kii ore chal diya, barwada aate janata ko raja ne puraa haal bataaya or samvath 1451 main adishkti chouth bhavani kii barwada main pahaad kii chotii par magh krishna chaturthi ko vidhi vidhaan se sthapit kiya, tab se lekar aaj tak isi din chouth mata kaa mela bharta he jisamen lakhon kii taadaad main bharatvarsh se bhagat jan maan kaa aashirwad lene aate rahete he
 The above saying is still going on for Bhimsingh Chauhan: - Leave Choru and leave the rest, Barwada Dhari Malan, "bhimsingh Chauhan Ku, Ma Di Di Parchaya Atom is prakaar chouth mata ke naam par barwada kshetra aage aage chouth kaa naam jodakar maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ne is kshetra kaa nayaa naam rakh diya chouth kaa barwada
 Chauth Mata Shakti Peetha is considered to be the most famous of the Chauth's Barwada in the temples of Chauth Mata, famous in India for Suhag Puja, so it will not be an exaggeration to call Chauth's Barwada as Shakti Nagar, Chauth Mata's first place
 The second Pachala has been a village, while Samvat from 1451 to the present, this temple is located at Chauth ka Barwara
 chouth mata ko choron va conjaro kii kuladevi mana jaataa he evam adivaasiyon main meena janajati ke nareda gautra kii kuladevi ke rup main chouth mata ji ko vishesh sthaan praapt he aaj bhi meena jati ke nareda gautra main navaratri puja ke samay mata ke pratik ke rup main trishul evam nahar ke putr nareda ke rup main nahar kaa panja banaakar poojane kii pratha pracheen samay se chali aa rahi he

 mimasaa darshan hinduon ke chah darshanon main se ek he
 Mimamsa is the name of the venerated meaning of Vedavakyas regarding the opposition
 ukt vichaar purv arya parampara se chalaa aayaa he
 But almost a quarter of five thousand years ago, the disciple of Samveda's Krishna Dvaipayana formulated it
 sutron main pur paksh or siddhanth ke rup main baadaraayan, baadari, aatreya, ashmarathy, aalekhan, etishaayan, kaamukayan, karshnajini ar labukayan maharishiyon kaa ullekh miltaa he, jiskaa vistrut vivechan sutron ke bhashya ar vaarthik main kiya gaya he, jinase sahasraadhikaran ho gaye hai
 This scripture is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedant's Uttermimamsa
 purmamimasaa main dharm kaa vichaar he ar uttarmimasaa main brahm kaa
 Therefore, the Dharmamimamsa of the East and the North, and the north-east is also called the Brahmanimansa
 jaimini muni dwaara rachit sutara hane se mimasaa kaa jaimineey dharmamimasaa kaha jaataa he
 The German scholar Maxmüller states that - "this philosophy cannot come in the category of philosophy, because it only discusses religion
 isamen jeev, ishwar, bandha, moksh or unke sadhano kaa kahin bhi vivechan nahin he
 " maxmooler mat ke pakshpaati kuch bhartiya vidvan bhi ise darshan kehane main sankoch karte hai, kyonki nyaay, vaisheshik, sankhya, yoga or vedant main jis prakaar tat tat prakarnon main pramaan or pramayon ke dwaara aatma-anatma, bandha-moksh aadi kaa mukhya rup se vivechan miltaa he, vaisaa mimasaa darshan ke sutara, bhashya or vaarthik aadi main drushtigochar nahin hota
 The above thinkers have expressed their views after studying the scripture with a gross intellect
 phir bhi spasht he ki mimasaa darshan hi sabhi darshanon kaa sahyogi kaaran he
 Jaimini has novelized these subjects in his sutra form "satsamprayoga Purushyasendriyanam Budhi Jan Tat Tatam" In the fourth sutra two words have come - Purusha and Wisdom
 purush shabd se "aatma" hi vivakshit he
 This meaning is written by Kumaril Bhatt in "bhattadipika"
 buddhi shabd se gyaan, pramaata, prameya or pramaan arth ko vyakt kiya gaya he
 The Vrittikar has given a detailed explanation of the direct, inferential words, meaning and unavoidable evidences in the three sutras to "tasya nimitta parishti:" in his lecture and a special discussion of subjectivism in the justified sutra
 isi kaa vishleshan shabar bhashya, shloke vaarthik, shastradipika, bhatt chintamani aadi granthon main kiya gaya he jisamen pramaan or pramayon kaa bhed, bandha, moksh or unke sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he
 In the philosophy of Mimamsa, the ideas of Varnashrama system, Adhanadi, Ashwamedhant etc
 have been discussed in the main life of religion of India
 praaia: vishwa main gyani or virakt purush sarvatra hote aae hai, kintu dharmacharan ke saakshaat falwetta or karmkand ke prakand vidvan bharatvarsh main hi hue hai
 Among them, the texts of Maharishi such as Katyayan, Ashwalayan, Apastamb, Bodhayan, Gautam etc
 are available even today
 
 The Indian ritual ritual theory receives redemption and support in this philosophy
 dow kunnan raja ne "brihati" ke dwitiya sanskaran kii bhoomika main iskaa samuchit rup se nirupan kiya he
 Although the name of religion is mentioned in Kanad Muni's vaheesic philosophy - it is not considered further
 kisi vidvan kaa kahana he - That is, just as a man goes into the Himalayas, desirous of going out to sea, in the same way, Kanad Muni, who was interested in lectures of religion, went on discussing the matter
 uttar mimasaa ke siddhant ke anusaar karmatyag ke pashchaat hi atmagyaan prapti kaa adhikaar he, kintu purv mimasaa darshan ke anusaar - According to this Vedamantra, Mumukshu people should also do karma
 vedavihit karm karne se karmbandhan swat: samaapt ho jaataa he - tasmanmumukshubhih kaary nityam naimittikan tathaa" aadi vachanon ke anusaar bhartiya aastik darshanon kaa mukhya praan mimasaa darshan he
 The Mimamsa philosophy is of sixteen chapters, with twelve chapters in order
 shastrasangati, adhyaysangati, padasngati or adhikarasangatiyon se susambaddha he
 What has been missed in these twelve chapters is represented in the remaining four chapters, which is famous as 'sankarsakand'
 usamen devtaa ke adhikaar kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, it is also called 'devata Kand' or can be called an appendix of two chapters
 bhaskar raay dikshit ne sankarshan cond kii vyakhya ke ant main likhaa he ki shodashadhai mimasaa ke rahete hue bhi pathnpathan madhya kaal main dwadashadhyay kaa hi hota tha
 Just as the scholarly class chants Tripada Gayatri even when Chatupada Gayatri is living, similarly in the present day, the study of Dwadashadhyayi Mimamsa is the only teaching
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar mimasaa ke bina vaakyarth kaa nirnay karnaa kathin he, kyonki amuk vaakya upasthit arth main pramaan he athwa anya arth main, is vichaar ke nirnay main jo nishkarsh aata he use mimasaa kaha gaya he, kintu yahan mimasaa shabd kaa arth darshan se he
 The idea of the meaning of non-contradictory Vedamantras for theology is called Mimamsa
 or vichaarpurvak praapt dharmagyaan mimasaa kaa fal he
 This is what Jamini has said in his philosophy of philosophy - that is, curiosity of religion

 Kumaril Bhatt described it as - aage vaakyarth nirnyopayogi sahasron nyaayon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Even six chapters have a brief theme
 is darshan main praptaprapt vivek nyaay se, athwa adagdh dahan nyaay se uddeshy vidhey bhav kaa vichaar kar veda-vaakyarth-nirnay se kartavya-akartavya kaa gyaan hota he
 Therefore, theology is the object of philosophy
 is darshan main dharmavichaar se upkram he
 Sanskrit literature is used in grammar for "grammar", grammatical justice, and "syntax" for epistemology
 is shaastra main hi dharmavichaar kii charchaa hai
 The main objective of the Indian public is religious worship
 anushthan fal ke bina nahin ho saktaa or falsaadhanta bhi saadhan saamagree ke bina nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, in short the means are also discussed
 anushthan ke purv dharm kaa lakshan, pramaan or saadhan fal jaananaa aavashyak he
 In this shastra, means, organs and balances are all three synonyms
 aise hi saadhy, sheshi or angi ye teenon paryaayavachi hai
 For example, if you want to perform the ritual of Darshan Purnamas for the attainment of heaven, then Darshan and Purnamas will be Angi and Prayas will be part of it
 darsh yag amavasya tithi ko or poornmaas yag poornima tithi ko hota he
 ) In this, the organ is the prime organ sponsor and the organ is usable
 is prakaar dharmaprapti ke sadhano ko jaanakar anushthan ke liye paurvapary kaa bhi gyaan apekshit he evam fal ke liye anushthey agni hotradi karmon ke prakaran main purvang or uttarang sadhano kaa bhi vivechan he, jinke liye "prakruti" shabd kaa prayog hota he
 But there is no recitation of the Anga in the Sannidhi of the solar day
 us sthal par aakanksha ke udai hone par darsh poornmaas main pratipaadit angon ko lenaa hota he jise atidesh kehete hai
 
 saamaanya rup se nirnay hone par bhi kis karm se kis karm main ang kaa aagaman hota he, iskaa vivechan visheshatidesh se kaha gaya he
 In spite of the excesses of the limbs, due to the difference in nature, the text is read in place of Prakrit
 udaahranarth "agney twa jushta nirvpaami"
 In this Shrutivakya, by placing the Suryapada of "suryohyeshti" in place of fire post, "surya Tvajushtam Nirvapami" recites this shruti
 aise vaakya ko "ooh" kehete hai
 Without the knowledge of these things, it is not possible to understand which parts should be used where and how, so that the ritual can be properly fruitful
 jis sthal par ang pathit na ho vahaan anya sthal se ang laana chahie, kintu jo vikruti yag ke upkaar kar sakate hon ve hi prakruti main liye ja sakate hai
 Those who cannot do favors in deformity, there is no recitation of other organs
 or unka anushthan bhi nahin hota
 Such words are called "obstructions"
 kis ang kaa baadh hota he or kiskaa nahin, iskaa nirnay "ooh" baadh ke adheen he
 And the desired fruitful karma is only one
 kintu kahin kahin anek bhi hote hai
 Some organs are ritualized before the head and some are also performed after the head
 udaahranarth samidheni prayajadi tathaa swisht krit anuyajadi
 It has been said about using those organs at the same time or multiple times - ek baar prayog karne kaa naam tantra he or anek baar ke karne kaa naam "aavriti" athwa "awaap" he
 Somewhere the organs are ritualized by mechanism and elsewhere by frequency
 isliye tantra or awaap kaa vichaar bhi aavashyak he
 For a particular fruit, do the ritual of the head organ and also perform its organs
 un angon ko bhi anya angon kii apeksha hone par jiske prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he use prasangi kehete hai
 It consists of the head mechanism, which is called context
 udaahranarth agnishtomic pashu purodashadi purvokt vishyon kaa purnagyata vyakti hi sangopang dharmanushthan kar saktaa he, jisaki vivechna "mimasaa darshan" main jaimini ne kii he
 The philosophy of this philosophy depicts the Dharmapramanas and depicts method, economism mantra, memory, etiquette, nomadism, conclusive sentences and strength
 dwitiyadhyaay main shabdaantar, abhyaas, sankhya, sangya, gun or prakarnaantar, ye chah karm bhed ke pramaan hai
 Shruti, gender, sentence, episode, place and Samakhya are the six evaluative evidences in Tritiyadhyaya
 chaturthadhyay main, shruti arth, paath, sthaan, mukhya or pravriti main chah bodhak pramaan hai There are seven types of excesses in Panchmadhyaya, directive, directive, nominal order, hypothetical order, dependency order and place-of-order
 ant ke do bhed saptavadhyay main varnit nahin hai
 These are denoted in the sense of authority and placements mandate
 navam adhyay main mantroh, samoh or sanskaroh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke "ooh" kaa nirupan he
 In Dasamadhyaya, there are three types of obstruction representations of distinction between earthlope, pratyamnaya and prohibition
 ekadshadhyay main tantra or aavaay kaa nirupan he
 Dwadasadhyaya has a representation of "context"
 is prakaar ek ek vishay kaa pratipaadan dwadashadhyaayaatmak mimasaa darshan main kiya gaya he jise "dwadashalakshani" bhi kaha gaya he
 Here the word symptom is a textbook isko do prakaar se vibhakt kiya gaya he jise upadesh or atidesh kehete hai
 Preaching is discussed in the first chapters
 dwitiya ke chah adhyyon main atidesh kaa vivechan he
 The above preaching is the overarching doctrine
 shaastra deepikacar parthasarathi mishra ke anusaar upadesh vichaar ke ananthar atidesh vichaar kaa aarambh hota he
 There are two chapters in present-day epistemology philosophy
 prayek adhyay main chaar paad hote hai, kintu tritiy, shashth or dasham adhyyon main aath aath paad hai, jise "shabra" adhyay bhi kehete hai
 In this way there are sixty feet in the whole book
 is darshan kii sutarasankhya main vivaad he
 In someone's opinion, two thousand six hundred fifty two, in another opinion two thousand seven hundred forty two sutras
 uparyukt varnan "aesekit" kii "karmmimasaa" naamak pustak prishth chaar main pratipaadit he
 "nyayamala", published from Anand Ashram Poona, has two thousand and forty five sutras
 isi prakaar kuch vyaktiyon ke mat se adhikaran sankhya nau sau saat praapt hoti he
 Some have nine hundred and fifteen sutras
 kintu "mimasasar sangrah" ke karta shankar bhatta ke anusaar "purvashatk" main paanch sau tees, uttardatk main chaar sau sattar sutara hai
 Thus the entire tribunal is divided into a thousand numbers
 uparyukt shloke ke anusaar adhikranon kii sankhya ek sahasr do sau pachaas he
 a tribunal is formed from many sutras, which consists of a principal sutra and other virtue sutras
 pradhan sutara purv paksh kaa pratipaadan karata he or anya sutara siddhant kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 Somewhere the northeast side has been rendered by two sources
 aise hi kahin kahin par bina sutara ke hi purv paksh kaa utthapan karke sutara se siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Somewhere, in principle, the ex-party tax doctrine has been rendered by the undertaking
 ek paad main katipay adhikaran hote hai
 For example, there are eight tribunals in the first foot
 adhikaran main chha: padaarth hote hai - vishay, sanshay, purvapaksh, siddhant prayojan or sangati
 Consistency is of three types - scriptural consistency, chapter consistency, and foot consistency
 pratham sutara - pratham adhikaran kaa naam jigyaasa adhikaran he
 Thought is the subject of science
 vichaar shaastra aarambh karne yogya he yaa nahin, yah sanshay he
 Not initiable, this is the former side
 siddhant he ki vichaar shaastra aarambh karnaa chahie
 The origin of this subject is the study method in the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and the teaching method in the "prabhakar" view
 purvapaksh main adhyayan kaa adrishy prayojan he or siddhant paksh main arth-gyaan-rup drusht prayojan he
 Since the religion of religion is related to philosophy, its interpretation in this school of thought is relevant
 is adhikaran main adhyayan drushtaarth hota he, yahi siddh kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the basic method of thinking is the study method
 arthgyan kaa saadhan adhyayan vidhi se akshipt hota he
 That is why the beginning of the scripture is valid
 dwitiya sutara - dwitiya adhikaran main dharm kaa lakshan or pramaan he, jisaki kartavyata vidhivaakya se prathit hoti he
 He is a means of credit
 yahan shrey shabd se aihik or aamushmik donon arth abhipret hai
 Gumak is a legal proof in the religion
 jo nishedh dwaara pratipaadit hota he vah anarth kaa saadhan hota he, use hi adharm kehete hai
 Third Sutra - The third sentence is the proof of the law sentence
 yahan pratigya maatr kii gai he
 They are said to be of two types - "chodnaiv Symptom Yasya, Chodana Symptom Me Yasya" ie here the direct evidence is not proof from religion, but legalism is considered as proof in religion
 chaturth sutara - is sutara main pratham pratigya ke samarthan ke liye chaturth adhikaran he
 Characterization of the Lok Siddha direct evidence in this tribunal - "indriarthasanikarsjanyajanam gyanam pratham"
 arthath pratyaksh vartmaan sannikrusht ko hi grahan karata he or dharm utpadyman he, atev pratyaksh dharm main pramaan nahin ho saktaa, kyonki dharm bhavishyat kaalik he
 From these words, the philosopher has not even considered the evidential inference heat and economics
 pancham sutara - chaturth sutara main chaturth adhikaran kii pratham jigyaasa kaa samarthan karke pancham sutara ke pancham adhikaran main dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 Law is the only proof in this tribunal, this pledge has been supported
 isi prasang main pramaanon kaa pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 That is, the knowledgeable material generates authenticity, and from the same material also becomes authentic
 vaakya do prakaar ke hote hai - loukik or vaidic
 Because of the proverbial sentence being masculine, malevolent delusions are accompanied by faults, pramad, vipralambha, karanapatava etc
, therefore, the sentence is not proof
 mantra brahmanatmak shabdarashi veda apaurushey he
 Therefore, due to not being illusory due to imperfection in legalism, legalism is the only proof in religion
 is dwitiya pratigya kaa samarthan karne ke liye pramaan kaa lakshan or shabdaarth kaa sambandh nity he
 Badarayana has also not accepted transcendence in Pramanya
 padaarth-pratipaadan main sanket dwaara shabd se padaarthon kaa, vaakyarth-pratipaadan main granth kaa or rachana dwaara purush kaa tridha sambandh hota he
 The entry of the man into the Veda has been denied by assuming the words and the meaning of the word-reader-relationship regularly
 arthath, veda purush ke dwaara pranit hai -aisa kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki hamanen vaakyon ko bina vyakti ke kabhi nahin suna, padhaa yaa janaa he
 Whereas, in the opinion of the Mimansakas, the relation of the word and the word Ghatpatadi-meaning is constant
 atah 'ye pad is arth ko bataata he'- is baat kaa hamen pataa na hone par bhi pad apane pratipaadya ko bataata hi he
 That is, even if there is no Shakti Graha, there is only the ability of rendering in the verse
 or vaakyarth sambandh ke dwaara purush sambandh ko pruthak karne ke liye vaakyadhikaran kii pravriti he
 In this tribunal, as the substance of the verse has power, the sentence has power in the sentence, such is not required for those who render, because the substance present in the verse is discovered by aspiration, merit and attachment
 Renders vaiyaakaran mat se vaakyarth vaakyashakti se bhaasith hota he
 According to this opinion, the relation of substances in word sense is related to the connection of dignity
 yah naiyayikon kaa mat he, jisase vaakya kii vaakyarth main pruthak shakti kii pratiti hoti he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne abhihitanvay kaa samarthan kiya he
 Prabhakar has supported Anavitabhidhan
 is tarah vaakyarth main purush sandendh dwitiya prakaar se nirast hua
 The third type is through scripture
 sandarbh vaakya kaa purush ke saath do prakaar se sambandh hota he, ek kartri-karm-bhav-sambandh dwaara or dwitiya prayukt-pravachan-bhav-sambandh dwaara hota he
 The discourse is common and the composition is extraordinary
 asaadhaaran visheshan hota he
 Therefore Veda is Pourusheya
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar vedon main purush, desh, nadi, vriksh aadi ke nirdesh hone ke kaaran vedon ko purushpranit athwa paurushey kehete hai, kintu mimasaa darshan ke anusaar pravachan bhi asaadhaaran mana gaya he
 For example, the legend about "katasamhita" or "kat brahmana" is the legend that "sorrow" was studied completely by Maharishi among many branch chapters
 dwitiya hetu he ki veda main purush, nadi aadi kaa naam aata he, isse bhi veda paurushey siddh hota he, kintu yah kalpana chatur-buddhi-vihit nahin; kyonki praaia: sarvapratham sansaarik vastuon ke naam veda se hi aae hai, usee drushti se lok -naam kii parampara chali he
 That is, the Vedas do not consider history to be impermanent, but it represents the continuity of history, its detailed interpretation is visible in the "shabarbhyas" of the epistle
 nity vishay or vaakya athwa vachan ko yathanupurvi brahmarshigan samadhi main darshan karte hai, atev veda main purvapurush kartrutvkalpana kaa lesh bhi samavesh nahin he
 "cosmic creations are masculine due to their male special curiosity, such as Mahabharata, Ramayana etc
 kumaril bhatta ke anusaar adhyayan parampara anadi he
 Therefore, Vedas are also extraordinary
 aise hi adhikaran siddhant nyaay se hi veda granth rachana ke dwaara purush sambandh nahin ho saktaa, atev vidhi vaakya hi dharm main pramaan he
 There is no fundamental formula in the philosophy of epistemology
 yadhyapi uttarmimasaa ke '"ek evatman: sharire bhavat" is sutara ke bhashya main shankaracharya ne likhaa he ki "purv-tantra" main atmpratipadak sutara nahin he, is vachan ko kahkar aatm swaroop kaa vivechan kiya he
 Quoting the Vrittikārā मतa doctrine authentically, it is written: "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvam and sharike vakshyam:"
 abhipraay yah hua ki purvamimasaa bhi uttarmimasaa kii tarah advay aatma ko maanakar hi nirmit hue hai, tathaapi purvamimasaa sharir ke atirikt kartta-bhokta aatmatatv ko maanakar hi prachlit hua he, kyonki karm-siddhant ke antargat "kritahani" or "akrutabhyagam" nihit he
 And from here there is the accomplishment of rebirth etc
 "chodana punararambh:" "satsamprayoge purushasyendryanam" in donon sutron se aatmbeej kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 And Vapan etc
 is the sacrament of pod
 purusharth main purush shabd se asthi yajna or krit yag se aatma ko fal prapti hoti he
 Shabar Swami, without specifying the sutra, considered the "yagyayudh Sentence" as an instrument, refuting the opinion of the non-believer, and proved the form of self through logic and srutis, which also proved the Vedas authenticity
 uttar-mimasaa main aatma ko ek hi mana gaya he; kintu "sankhya yoga", nyaay, vaisheshik or purvamimasaa main aatma ko anek mana gaya he, jiskaa karm ke dwaara sharir, indriya or man se sambandh hota he
 Therefore, body, sense and subject are called bandhas
 ukt tray aatma ko bandhan main daalate hai, jisase aatma sukhdu:khadi dwandv ko bhogata he
 While doing routine katattavya buddhi to routine moral deeds, the creature keeps on consuming the destiny deeds
 sharir indriya se atirikt jo brahm buddhi se aatma kii upasna karata he uskaa sharir indriya aadi se sambandh kaa koi kaaran nahin he, aisa vyakti vartmaan sharir ke naash ke pashchaat swa swaroop main sthit ho jaataa he
 According to Uttarmimamsa, body, senses and subject have been called bonds which are the cause of ignorance; His retirement is salvation
 udaahranarth - "nivritiratma Mohsya Known purvamimasaa bhi yahi sweekaar karata he ki sharir, indriya or vishyon kaa sambandh hi bandhan hai, tathaa uskaa vilay hi moksh he, jiskaa saadhan, gyaan or karm samucchy he
 There are two types of enlightenment
 shariratirikt atmagyaan ritu kaa ang hota he, jo ni:shreyaskaarak he
 Vedic and temporal sentences have been interpreted by a number of thousands of sentences for judicial usable judgments
 atev bhartiya darshanon main pratham sthaan karm pratipadak purvamimasaa darshan kaa hi he
 Uttarmimamsa considers creation from ignorance and destruction of creation from enlightenment
 nyaay, vaisheshik darshan ne dvanukadi kram se mahabhoot paryant mahasrishti or mahabhoot se parmaanu paryant vinaash ko mahapralay kaha he
 That is, the entire gesture functions are generated in a double order and are destroyed from macro to nuclear
 panch mahabhuton main prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu ke parmaanu nity hai
 The sky itself is continual, but according to the earlier epistemology, there are two types of creation and three types of holocaust, in which the word Mahasrishti and Khand Srishti are called two creation
 aise hi pralay, mahapralay or khand pralay shabd se teen pralay kahe gaye hai
 Among them, Khandi Srishti and Khanda Pralaya have been considered similar to nowadays
 udaahranarth kisi sthal vishesh kaa bukamp aadi se vinaash ho jaataa he or kahin par naveen vastu kii sristi ho jaati he
 In Mahasrishti, the creation of atoms in the Panchamabhuta by the atom from the atoms in the Mahasrishti, which is mentioned in the tenth mandala of the Rigveda - matsaypuranadi main bhi khand pralay ke antargat vidyaman padaarthon kii sthiti kaa vivaran praapt hota he, kintu purv mimasaa mahasrishti or mahapralay ko sweekaar nahin karata
 According to him, no evidence is available in the destruction of all substances
 jaisaa ki vaarthikkaar ne kaha he - Mimamsa philosophy considers block creation and block holocaust
 bhartiya chha: aastik darshanon main nyaay, vaisheshik or vedant kii ishwar sadhak yuktiyaan praaia: samaan hi hai
 For example "yato va Imani Bhoothani Jayante", "dyavabhumi Janayan Dev Ek:" "vishvasya Kattra Bhuvanasya Gopta" through these Srutis and "janmadasya Yatra": This Vedanta Sutra proves God
 isi prakaar nyaay shaastra ke "kshityankuradik kartrujanrya kaaryatvat ghatavat" anumaan se bhi ishwar kii siddhi kii gai he, kintu vedantiyon ne shrutiyon se ishwar ko siddh kar anumaan pramaan ko unka sahakaari kaaran mana he
 And Naiyayikas have supposedly proved God to be the cooperative cause of Shrutis
 sankhya darshan main do mat hai - seshwar or nirishwar
 The Sesvara Samkhists believe in God, but treat him with a special word
 nirishwar sankhyavaadee ishwar kaa nishedh karte hai, "kintu vigyaan bhikshu ne "ishwarasiddhe:" is sutara main "pramanabhavat" is pad kaa ullekh kar ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 Mimamsa philosophy does not prohibit the support of God in the same manner as the Naiyayikas, and like the Nirishvara Samyakists, but in the "sambandesh Parihar" treatise, Kumaril Bhatt has resolved the meaning of God in relation to the word
 abhipraay yah he ki sambandh kaa karta ishwar nahin he
 By accepting the above words, it is popular that Mimamsak is an atheist
 kumaril bhatta, nandishwar aadi mimasakon ne anumaansiddh ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he or vedasiddh ishwar ko sweekaar kiya he
 In fact, Mimamsa accepts Siddha Brahma or God from the Veda
 kyaaki mimasaa darshan veda kaa swatah pramaan maanata he
 Mimamsa is also known as Purvimamsa and Vedantaka Uttermimansa
 isse bhi veydant kaa mimasaa ke sidbhant ar mimasaa kaa veydant ke siddhanth maanya hai yah baat spasht haati he
 Vedhita Yagadi Karma Dravya and Deity are compatible with these two
 dravya dadhyadi he or devtaa shastrake samadhigamya he
 That is, the sentence which the deity says is considered the deity
 yahan devtaa ke vishay main teen paksh dashamadhyay ke chaturthpad main or shabar bhashya aadi granthon main bhi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The meaning deity is the specific deity and the word deity
 in teenon main antim paksh hi siddhant he, kyonki arth kaa samaran shabd ke dwaara hua karata he
 Therefore, because of the first appearance of the word, the word itself has been considered a deity
 udaahranarth "indraay swaha, takshakaay swaha" shabdon main indraay or takshakaay ye chaturthaant pad hi devtaa hai
 Even those who accept the meaning of the deity cannot ignore the word
 at: teenon pakshon main shabd mukhya hone ke kaaran mimasakon ne shabd ko hi devtaa sweekaar kiya he
 There is a rule here - the deity word which is in the method sentence should be pronounced in evacuation, renunciation and hymn, etc
, not its synonyms
 udaahranarth "aagneyamshtakapalam" main agni ke paryaayavachi "jatvedas" shabd kaa prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 It is known from the above things that the "word goddess" is the principle of Mimamsa philosophy
 devtaa ke vigrahadi sadasad bhav kaa vichaar - agni aadi devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch is darshan main maane jate hai
 That is, Vigraha, Havish, Bhoga, Aishwarya, happiness and fruitfulness are these five Vigrasha
 ukt vachan ke aadhaar par hi vedantiyon ne devtaa ke vigrahadi paanch swaroop maane hai
 The idea is that just like humans etc
, the taxes, steps etc
 are also of the gods, they accept Havish, eat and eat and give happiness to the Yajaman
 at: devtaa vigrahadiman hai
 The above thought is the same Yasak Maharishi has proved masculinity with the sentence "athakaar Chintanam" of "nirukta"
 mimasaa darshan ke anusaar "shabdamayi devtaa" kaa samarthan kiya gaya he, kintu shabar swami ne apane shashth devataadhikaran bhashya main devtaa vigrah kaa khandan kiya he
 Generally, all the scholars like Parthasarathi, Khandadeva etc
 have followed this path, but in his commentary, Kumaril Bhatt has considered the deity as a part of it and not the deity as the head, and has accepted karma primarily and said that karma is the fruit
 gives
 swami ke rahete hue das se koi fal kii yachana nahin karata
 Karmana Phaljakantavam and Shabdmayi Devta, the above two principles have been supported by other minders by considering the deity Vigrahadi
 bhashyakaar shabar kaa devtaa vigrah kaa niraakaran prodhiwaad se jaananaa chahie
 Therefore, Purvimamsa accepts the "word goddess"
 uskaa gyaan, taddhit, chaturthi vibhakti or mantravarna in teenon se hota he
 The only difference between them is that with the frequency of the corresponding power, the deity realizes
 chaturthi vibhakti lakshanya or mantravarna adhishthan kaa bodhan karata he
 Mimamsadarsan has considered the part of the deeds of the deity in the above manner in terms of his ritualism
 vastutah devatashastra ta nirukt he
 Nirukta is Vedang and epistemology is Vedapang
 atah vaidic devataatatvavichaar ke prasang main nirukt ke vivechan kaa swatantra ar mukhya devataatatvavichaar maananaa avashyak haata he
 The realization through sentences is called sentence comprehension or word comprehension
 vaakya bhi aakhyaant hi hota he - Subantachaya: Sentence, Tingantachayavakyam, Suptingantachayo Sentam
 usamen ye teen paksh hai, jinamein karkanvit kriya honi chahie
 According to Amarkosh - "tidd
subant chayo sentence verb va karkhavitaita"
 arthath subant or tingant vaakyon kaa karkanvit kriya paryavsaan hota he
 The three views of Kumaril Bhatt, Prabhakar and Murari are famous in the East India, but in the last, a famous text with the name "tripad Niti Nayan" has also been known
 mimasakon main abhihitanvayavaad ar anvitabhidhanwaad naam se do prasthaan prasiddh hai
 Among them, first is the opinion of Kumaril Bhatt and second Prabhakar
 shaabdh bodh main bhaavana ko mukhya rup se bhatta ne sweekaar kiya he
 Prabhakar has accepted the task as the main one
 abhihitanvay shabd kaa yah arth he ki padon se pratipaadit padaarth gyaan aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti samanvit hokar lakshana ke dwaara shaabdabodh karaate hai In the Nyayamat, there is power in the substance of the posts and the verses signify knowledge
 padon se padaarth kii upasthiti hoti he
 Similarly, it is said in Mimamsa, for example Jyotishtomen Swarga Kamo Yajet "
 yahan "yajet" main do ansh hai -"yaj" dhaatu or "t" pratyay
 The suffix represents the emotional sense of exposition
 us bhaavana kii teen aakankshaayen hoti hai - saadhyaakanksha sadhanakanksha or "itikartavyatakanksha"
 On attaining realization, there is a true discovery of heaven
 sadhanakanksha hone par dhatworth kaa kaarantven anvay hota he
 
 iti kartavyatakanksha hone par itikartavyatatven anvay hota he
 The sentence states that vishisht arth kaa bodh karne ke liye vaakya lok main prayukt hota he
 Padraavana leads to separate knowledge of substances
 yah vaacharth he, kintu jo padaarthagyan hota he vah shrota ko abhipret nahin or jiske liye vaakya prayukt hua usase shrota kaa kaary nahin hota, aise sthal main vaakya taatpary kii anutpatti hoti he
 Consequently, symptoms have been considered for prevention of deficiency
 sabhi darshanikon ne taatparyanupapatti ko lakshana kaa beej sweekaar kiya he
 Two types of meanings are considered, first meaning and second meaning
 pratham avaantar taatpary padaarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he or mahataatpary vaakyarth vishay kaa pratipaadan karata he
 In aphorism, there is a sense of sentence by sentence
 kumaril bhatta ne nimna shlokon se pratipaadan kiya he - By this word, the form of Bhatt Padaka Orientalism is shown
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki "ananvitavasth" padaarth padon se abhihit hote hai
 Their discovery is only targeted
 atev "anvitabhidhanwaad" kumaril bhatta kaa he, kintu bhatta mat kaa anuvadak anvitabhidhanwaad maanakar jo khandan karte hai, yah uchit nahin he, kyonki unke granthon main uparyukt lekh kii charchaa kahin bhi nahin he
 This is what the word Anavitabhidhan means - the verses are called Anvirtha Bodhan
 atev pad shakti se hi padaarth or vaakyarth donon kaa bodh ho jaataa he
 There is no need to assume additional signs etc
 from the position of power
 vayovruddh purush kisi vastu ko laane le jane ke liye shabd kaa prayog karata he
 The child next to him understands the meaning of the word by hearing the word and seeing the other man carrying and carrying it
 yahi pravriti kaa kaaryatagyaan kaaran he
 In folk, action is also considered as action, similarly in Vedas, Yagadi action is considered as primary work
 yagadi kriya kshanik he or swarg kalantar bhavi he
 Therefore, the said Veda is considered as an object called "apurva," apart from the sentence discussion
 yahan par "ek kaary shabd" kii purvokt do shaktiyaan do arthon main sweekaar kerani padati hai
 One has to accept strength and the other is to be characterized
 usamen bhi alokik kaary main vishesh shakti he, jaisaa vidwaanon main prachlit he - In folk, there is a symptom in action form
 veda main pad hi vaakya hote hai or padaarth hi vaakyarth hota he 
 In this opinion, synonyms, anvay and sangaras are all synonymous
 arthath anvit hi anvay main nimitt hota he
 Prabhakar has considered customer eclipse, that proves investigative
 is mat main - "yajet swargkaam:" is vaakya se anvitabhidhan kaa shaabd bodh hota he
 In this darshan, there is only the provision of Yag for heaven
 swarg se abhipraay yah he - jo du:kha se grast na ho tathaa du:kha utpann kii usamen sambhaavna na ho or abhilaashaa ko purna kare use swarg kehete hai
 By means of sentences like "dashapurnamasabhyam swargakamo yajet" etc
, the instrument of heaven has been constituted by Darshanamasam Yag
 yag ko kshanik mana gaya he, kyonki kisi devtaa ke uddeshy se dravya ke tyaag kaa naam yag he
 "indray Idan Na Mama" renounces the psyche business with this sentence
 us kshan main us vyapaar kaa naash ho jaataa he
 The subject of imperfect love is called heaven
 vah kalantar athwa janmaantar main praapt hota he
 This is the rule of philosophy, reason must remain in the disorganized prior moment of Kayapatti, and transient yag birth is not possible in the haphazard predecessor of future self-consciousness
 etdarth ukt shruti ke aadhaar se yag kaa saadhy, swarg kaa saadhan athwa yag kii uttaravastha evam fal kii purvavastha, ye sab ek vastu siddh hoti hai, jise atishay, apurv, yaa yogyata kehete hai
 It has been elaborately analyzed by Kumaril Bhatt in Unreasonable Action
 yaganushthan ke purv purush main swarg ke upbhog karne kii yogyata nahin hoti
 Even before the rituals, there is no ability to give Swargadi fruit and by resolving the inefficiency of the man and the inefficiency of karma, the scriptural ability is now considered to be incomparable
 yatha This is called as pre-emptive or preplanned
 jahaan ek hi pradhan ho vahaan pradhan yag se jo apurv utpann hota use utpatypurv kehete hai
 The phenomena that arise from the organs are called Angaapurava
 angaporesv or pradhanapurv donon milakar parmapurv ko utpann karte hai
 From it, you get the fruit of Swargadi
 kuch yaagon main anek pradhanon se fal hota he
 For example - Darsha has three Yagas and Pournamas also has three Yagas
 yahan teenon pradhanon se utpann honevaale teen utpatypurvo se ek samudaya purv utpann hota he
 a pre-eminent arises from both communities
 abhipraay yah hua ki uparyukt pratham udhaaharan main teen apurv maane jate hai
 In the second example, preterm, premenstrual, preclinical and preclinical, four are considered incomplete
 ye hi mimasakon kaa sarvasv he
 In it Bhatt Mimansak Shabar Bhasya 2
 1
 2 according to "yagen Apurva Kritva Swarga Bhavayet", accomplishes Apoorva with words and with eloquence
 or use lingadi kaa vachya tathaa shabdabodh main mukhya visheshya maanate hai
 Apoorva has been refuted by all philosophers, it is a refutation of speech and precept
 darshan shastron main padaarthvivechna ke liye chaar kotiyaan maani gai hai - Proof theorem theorem
 pramaan - pramaan use kehete hai jisase vishay kaa nishchayatmak gyaan ho or vishay kaa nirdhaaran ho
 Theorem - One who has knowledge through proof is called a theorem
 pramiti - pramaan ke dwaara jis kisi bhi vishay kaa nishchayatmak gyaan ho, use pramiti kehete hai
 Pramata - One who knows theorem knowledge through proof - is called Pramata
 yahan vibhinn bhartiya darshanikon ne gyaan ke vishay main dwividh vichaar kiya he - The authenticity of knowledge is automatically admissible or layer: admissible
 swat: koti main mimasak, vedanti or buddha aate hai
 Layer: Justice, Vaiseshika, Yoga, Jain and Charvak are included in the category
 yahan pramanya shabd se arthtathatv lakshan pramanya samajhnaa chahie, na ki agyatarth gyaapakatv lakshan pramanya
 Chodanalakshanodharm: In the sutra - "naanu Athatabhumapayartha Bruyat Chodana", etc
, the meaning of the subject is explained
 "tachch abadhitatvan, arthnirutho dharm vishesh:, tasya gyanen niruprana"
 Chaudna Sutra's commentary "athaattva Bhootam Artha" refers to the non-objective meaningless religion, which is represented by knowledge
 atev pramanya ko gyananishtha kaha jaataa he
 That layer is generated and layer is admitted
 yah naiyayikon kaa siddhant he
 That is, the material from which knowledge is generated, does not originate from other material, and from which knowledge is acquired, from which knowledge is acquired rather than from other qualities, knowledge is acquired from knowledge
 isse yah aayaa ki gyanotpadak saamagree se bhinn saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or gyaan graahak saamagree se bhinn saamagree ke dwaara pramanya gruhit hota he
 In this opinion, there is both the primordial and the imperfect layer
 yah naiyayik sammat vivechna he
 In the above opinion, Mimansak people tell infidel dosha, due to which knowledge can never be proved valid
 arthath lokvyavahaar vicchhinn ho jayega
 Therefore, knowledge is self-generated and automatically acquired
 abhipraay yah he ki jis samagri se gyaan utpann hota he, usee saamagree se pramanya bhi utpann hota he; or jis saamagree se gyaan gruhit hota he usee saamagree se pramanya bhi gruhit hota he
 This is the self-authenticity of the Authentic Mimanskadikas, which Kumaril Bhatt has endorsed in his treatise Bhatta Vartika with many tips - yahan bhattamat main gyaan anumey he
 Something excessive arises in the subject of knowledge, from which it is known
 isse gyatata naamak ek dharm ghatadi vishay main utpann hota he, jise practyam, bhasana, prakaash: aadi shabdon se kaha jaataa he
 From this it came to be known that knowledge is derived from the presumption of gender
 isi se pramanya kaa bhi grahan hota he
 Knowledge itself is light in Prabhakarism
 at: gyaan se hi gyananishtha pramanya kaa bhi grahan hota he
 Therefore, the automatic belief is the same in both opinions, which are discussed in detail in "shloka Vartika", "case Panjika", "nyaya Ratnamala"
 pratyaksh anumaanadi se anavgat arth ke bodhak vaakya ko vidhi kehete hai
 That is, the name of the sentence which is unknowable, objectionable promoter
 vidhyarth ke sambandh main mimasakon ke do paksh hai - ek pravartana ko vidhyarth maanata he
 Almost all the parents come here
 doosraa kaary ko vidhyarth maanata he
 This is Prabhakar's theory
 is paksh main is prakaar kaa utpaadan hota he - Promoters in folk, Acharya or Raja use the sentence "gamanay" etc
 to instill their disciples or acts
 shishy yaa bhrity ukt vaakya ko sunakar uske arth kaa anusandhan karata he
 After this, "gavanayan" comes into the act
 isliye pravartak purush kaa jo abhipraay vishesh he, use lok main vidhyarth kehete hai
 It is the action of man who lives in man
 atev ise purushabhipraay bhi kehete hai
 The Vedic Lingadis cannot be called Purushabhipraya because Vedas are apaurusheya
 at: purush ke sthaan par lingadi shabd kaa prayog hota he
 His business specialty is the same
 shabdanishth hone ke kaaran ise shabdi bhaavana bhi kehete hai
 It has been characterized as "purushaapravakanutika: Promoter Lingadinishtho trade especially: Shabdi Bhavna"
 shaastra main ise hi pravartana, prerana aadi kaha gaya hai
 There are two types of instincts in the world - first, the male instincts by his will
 dwitiya pravartak purush, athwa shabd ke dwaara vyakti pravrutt hota he, jise "prerana janya" kehete hai
 Where there is a tendency after inspiration, enlightenment is considered to be the promoter, which Mandan Mishra, Parthasarathi Prabhriti scholars have considered as "favors"
 nyaay sudhakar ne ise alokik dharm vishesh mana he
 Prabhakar Mishra has considered working knowledge towards the tendency, which leads to obsolescence etc
 at: "chodana lakshano dharm:" sutara main likhaa he - "acharya chodith" karomi" is bhashya kii vyakhya karte hue shalikanath ne kaha he - chodith: pravartit:, kaaryamvabodhit: ityarth:, kaaryatagyaan vina pravriterasambhavaditi" atev prabhakar mat main kaha gaya he - "kaary vidhyarth:, tachch kaary dhatvarthatiriktam, apurv shabd vachyam tadev vidhyarth iti" Four types of methods have been presented in the philosophy of Mimamsa, which is for the decision of the Vedas
 uttpattividhi : jis vaakya se karm swaroop kii katrtavyata prathmat: vidit hoti ho use utpattividhi kehete hai
 For example, "agnihotra Juhoti" means to get favored from a house called Agnihotra
 viniogvidhi : angapradhan kaa sambandh jis vidhivaakya se gyaat hota he, use viniogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, "dadhna Juhoti" explains the meaning of havana with curd
 isamen dadhi saadhan he or home saadhy he
 Here the relation of the word appropriation should be understood in the appropriation method
 vah sambandh saadhy-saadhan-bhav, angangi bhav athwa sheshsheshi bhav main samaapt hota he
 Experimental method: One who makes sense of order in the ritual of head and organ is called experiment
 udaahranarth prayajadi ang se upakrit pradhan darshapurnmaas yag se swarg kii prapti hoti he
 It is with this intent that the symptom is described as "anganam serial method; Methodology:" adhikaravidhi : jis vidhi se karmjanya fal kaa bhokta karta ko mana jaataa ho use adhikaravidhi kehete hai
 For example, "yajet Swarga Kama:" The one who is the priest here is the one who is the bearer of heaven
 isi prakaar se apurv vidhi, niyam vidhi or parisankhya vidhi ke bhed se teen prakaar kii vidhiyaan prasiddh hai - There are two types of methods mentioned above, it should be understood in this way that the origin, appropriation experiment and authority law are all around in the invention
 niyam tathaa parisankhya vidhi, viniyog vidhi main hi antargat he
 Special knowledge of this subject is visible in Bhatt Chintamani

 There is a bell inside the clock, on which the sound is produced when a hammer is hurt
 yah hathaudaa ek bhaar yaa kamaani se judaa rahata he, jo ise nishchit avadhi par chalaati he
 These watches are different from normal mechanical clocks only in that electric power is used to re-wrap their arches
 vidyut dwaara lapetane kii yah kriya yaa to lolak ke prayek dolan par, yaa nishchit avadhiyon ke antar par, hoti rahati he
 Smaller clocks can be run with the help of electrical batteries, and larger clocks are connected to the electric mains

 In 1948, the Bureau of Standards of the United States of America, announced the design of atomic clocks
 ye ghadiyaan bhi daab-vidyut-manibhayukt saamaanya vidyut ghadiyon kii bhanti hoti hai
 The only difference is that their controlling frequency is provided by the self-oscillating-frequency of excited molecules or atoms instead of the alternating current
 ye aavritiyaan praaia: 1010 chakra prati second kii koti kii hoti hai
 Such atomic clocks are highly sensitive and accurate and do not get errors even up to 0
01 seconds in a year

 britain ne apane swaarthon kii raksha ke liye china main opium ke seven ko badhaava diya tha or is nashe main galiff chiniyon kaa bharpoor utpeedan kiya tha
 Therefore, it was but natural that resentment was growing in the minds of the patriotic Chinese against these oppressive circumstances
 china kii pehali kranti kaa swaroop mukhyatah saanskrithik tha or iskaa sutarapaat dow sanyaat sen ne kiya tha
 It was with his efforts that the Nationalist Chinese Party was established, which is known as 'kuomitang'
 1911 main jis maanchu rajvansh kaa ant kar ganatantr kii sthapana kii gai uskaa asthaayee raashtrapati yuvan shih kaai tha
 But in reactionary and repressive measures, he banned the Kuomitang Dal and Sanayat Sen had to flee to Japan

 In fact, Dr
 Sanayat Sen wanted to get foreign aid to organize China, but the imperialist states of the west did not help him, eventually he turned to the Soviet Union

 Chiang believed that the communists were becoming powerful, invading the landlords and occupying their property
 atah inhen samaapt karnaa aavashyak he
 Chiang Kai-shek launched a purification movement by expelling the Communists from the party in which thousands of communists, trade unionists and peasant leaders were killed
 is tarah chyang kaai shaike ne nanking main apni satta ko majbootee se sthapit kiya
 In 1943, Maotse Tung became the chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and became the top leader

 The reason was that China was originally an agricultural country where the industrial revolution was still backward
 kiyangsi praant kii communist maaon sarkaar nanking kii kuomitanga sarkaar kii satta ko sweekaar nahin karti thi
 The government of Nanking under Chiang Kai Chek campaigned fiercely in 1934 against the communist government of Qiangsi to strengthen its position

 Communists were killed in lakhs

 Chiang Kai-shek understood communism as a greater threat than the Japanese at this time and exerted his entire power in the suppression of communists

 Mao said that both the Kuomitang and the Communists should jointly establish a government in the country and together with the Japanese invasion, they should establish a government in the country and together with the Japanese invasion, they should be expelled from the country 
 samyavaadiyon ke is drushtikon se chini janata kaa bahumat unke saath ho gaya faltah samyavaadee ko apni shakti badhaane kaa mauka mila
 Chiang Kai-shek considered it more important to wipe out the Communists than to stop the Japanese, and so sent an army to Liaoning Shenxi province to fight with the Communists in 1936, but the Communists did not think it appropriate to fight their Chinese brothers and under Liang Sent the sent army with national consciousness and asked the Japanese to fight
 jab chyang kaai shaike ne samyavaadiyon ke daman kii hi baat kii tab liyang ne use bandi bana liya kintu samyavaadiyon ke hastkshep se antat vah mukt hua
 Therefore, in view of the desire of Chinese Lokmat, Chiang began negotiations with the Samvadis and entered into an agreement in 1937 to destroy Japan's dominance by making concerted efforts
 is samjhaute ke anusaar uttar-pashchimi china ke shensi or kangsu praant par samyavaadiyon ke shashan ko sweekaar kiya gaya or samyavaadee sena ko china kii rashtriya sena kaa ang maan liya gaya jise japan ke viruddh mahasenapati chyang kaai shaike ke adeshon kaa paalan karnaa tha
 Thus, two separate governments existed in China at this time
 donon kii apni-apni pruthak senaayen thi or donon apane-apane kshetron main apane aadarshon ke anusaar shashan or saamaajik vyavastha ke vikaas main tatpar thi
 This agreement proved to be extremely important in increasing the power of the Communists
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kiya or use parajeet kiya tathaa china par kabja kar liya
 Chiang Kai-shek had to retreat and Chungqing was made its capital in the west after Japan took control of Nanking

 Because of this, there was a huge support from the Japanese oppressed peasants and the middle class

 Even at that time Chiang Kai-shek was concerned with increasing power to the communists, not the Japanese invasion
 vah japan ke viruddh sangharsh kii apeksha china kii aantarik raajnneeti ko adhik mahatv detaa tha
 Therefore, the situation of conflict between the Communists and the Kuomitang resurfaced
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke shuru ho jane se china-japan yuddh america-british nitiyon se prabhavit hone laga
 The United States and Britain transported millions of tons of war material by air to help Chiang Kai-shek's government so that the influence of Japan or Russia would not increase in China
 vastutah china ke aantarik maamalon main america or britain ke hastkshep kaa ek bada kaaran unka samyavaadee vichaardhaara kaa virdohi hona tha
 Britain and America wanted to stop the civil war in China because the victory of powerful communists who were powerful in the event of civil war was almost certainly seen
 america or britain ne chungking kii chyang koi shaike sarkaar ko apane paksh main karne ke liye 1943 main uske saath ek sandhi kii
 Under the treaty, these two countries renounced their privileges in China and acknowledged that China is equivalent to the western countries in political terms and is a major powerful state in the world
 america sahit mitrarashtra yah chaahate the ki china kii chyang kaai shaike sarkaar japan ke saath yuddh ko jari rakhe or uske saath koi samjhauta nahi karen
 At the same time, he will work with the communist government to fight the Japanese

 In 1945, Japan surrendered and World War II came to an end, but the problem of China did not end
 vastutah nanking main japan kaa niyantran tha or yuddh kii samaapti pashchaat yah samasya utpann hui ki nanking sarkaar ke adhikrut pradeshon par chungking kii kuomitanga sarkaar kaa aadhipaty ho yaa yenon praant kii samyavaadee sarkaar ke adhikrut pradeshon par chungking kii kuomitanga sarkaar kaa aadhipaty ho yaa yenon praant kii samyavaadee sarkaar kaa, donon dal nanking par niyantran hetu aage bade
 Therefore, a situation of civil war arose again in China
 america ne grihayuddh ko taalane ke liye 1945 main general marshall ko donon dalon ke bich samjhauta karaane evam loktantr kii sthapana karaane hetu bheja
 This agreement was concluded on 10 January 1946 with the efforts of Marshall
 samjhaute ke anusaar jis pradesh main jis dal kii sena kaa adhikaar he vah usee sena ke adhikaar main rahegaa, kintu yah samjhauta sthaayee nahin rahaa or tamaam pradeshon par adhikaar ko lekar grihayuddh aarambh ho gaya
 The communist army established its authority over many territories of northern and eastern China
 janvari 1949 tak samyavaadiyon ne tintsin or peking par adhikaar kar liya or aage chalakar nanking, shanghai hanko tathaa canton par bhi adhikaar kar liya or 1 oktober, 1949 ko samyavaadiyon ne peking main “locaganraajya” kii ghoshnaa kii or soviet sangh sahit anek deshon ne is samyavaadee sarkaar ko manyata de di
 Thus the communist revolution in China was successful
 chyang kaai shaike kii kuomitanga sarkaar formosa dweep main simat kar rah gai
 By not recognizing the communist government of China, the US recognized the nationalist government based in Formosa as the government of China and maintained its relationship
 vastutah samyavaadiyon or chyang kaai shaike ke bich sangharsh main america chaahate hue bhi chyang ko khulaa samarthan nahin de sakaa kyonki tab rus samyavaadiyon ke samarthan main aa jaataa
 In this case, there would have been a possibility of direct conflict between the us-russia
 faltah america ne praayah tatasthta kii niti kaa samarthan kiya or is kaaran chyang kaai shaike kii raajnneetik sthiti atyant kamjor ho gai
 1
 Unpopularity and corrupt governance of the Kuomitang Dal: The Kuomitang government under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek was corrupt and worthless
 unke janata ko sudhaar ke rup main dene ke liye kuch nahin tha
 He did not announce any program that could achieve widespread public support
 itnaa hi nahin kuomitanga sarkaar ne apana adhikansh samay udyogpatiyon, bankeron va jameendaaron ke hiton kii raksha main ganvaaya
 Corruption was prevalent in the government, the material brought for the use of the public was being used in private commercial means, in such a situation the government lost public support

 Soldiers were not paid on time
 sainikon kii bhartee or padonnati yogyata par aadhaarit na hokar chyang bhakthi par aadhaarit thi
 The military weakness and ineptitude of Chiang's government became evident during the Civil War
 In fact, Chiang's army conducted the war by making large cities central, but these cities were surrounded by communists
 iske vipareet samyavaadee sena daksh or kushal thi
 He fought the war by adopting a strategy of guerrilla method, maintaining discipline in the army
 faltah rashtravaadiyon ke viruddh ve safal hue
 3
 Socio-economic dissatisfaction among various sections of the society: Nothing was done by the Kuomitang government to alleviate the poverty of the farmers
 sookhe or akaal se pedi∏t krishakon kii dasha behaal thi duusari ore shaharon main munafkhoron, saudagaron kii madiyon ne anaaj kii kami nahin thi
 US dominance was excessive in China and foreign capitalists were exploiting China heavily
 kuomitanga sarkaar is shoshan ko roak paane main asamarth thi
 As a result, the capitalist class including the general public also became opposed to the government
 vastutah jansamarthan hasil karne ke liye kuomitanga sarkaar ne koi thos saamaajik, aarthik kaarykram pesh nahin kiya jabaki samyavaadiyon ne aisa kaarykram pesh kar jansamarthan hasil kiya
 4
 Nationalist government's relationship with imperialist powers: China's nationalist Kuomitang government had relations with imperialist countries such as America
 chini arthvyavastha america aarthik samrajyavaadee niti se parichaalit ho rahi thi
 The American bank had control over China's banking system
 china main atyadhik maatra main america maal aa rahe the
 By 1848, this volume had become so high that most of China's industrial units were closed and all the workers became useless
 yahi vajah he ki kisaan-majdoor aadi logon ne sarkaar kii niti se asantusht hokar grihayuddh main chini samyavaadiyon kaa saath diya
 As a result, the Communists succeeded
 5
 chyang kaai shaike kii adoordarshita : japani akraman or samyavaadiyon ke saath sambandhon main chyang kaai shaike ne adoordarshita kaa parichay diya
 He perceived the Communists as a greater threat than the threat of the Japanese invasion and attempted to suppress the Communists
 jabaki samyavaadiyon ne japani akraman ko china ke hiton ke viruddh maanakar apane kshetron main unka datakar muqabla kiya, aisi sthiti main janata kaa samarthan samyavaadiyon ko mila or grihayuddh main samyavaadiyon ne chyang kaai shaike ko parajeet kar safalataa praapt kii

 galileo gallily italy ke vaigyanik the
 He was a great inventor and had incomparable support in the development of visionaries
 is mahaan vichaarak kaa janm aadhunik italy ke pisa naamak shahar main ek sangitajna parivaar main hua tha
 The city of Pisa, modern Italy, had historically blamed the birth of the great scientist Galileo Galilei on 15 February 1564 as a flaw in the creation of God
 galileo ke dwaara pratipaadit sindvanto se dharmik manyataon kaa khandan hota tha jiske liye galileo ko ishwariya manyataon se chhedchhad karne ke liye sari umr karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 His father Vincenzo Galilei was a well-known music expert of the time
 ve "lut" naamak vaadya yantra bajaate the, yahi lut naamak yantra baad main guitar or benzo ke rup main viksit hua
 During his musical composition, Vincenzo Galilei intimately studied the tension of the stringed string or the string and the tones emanating from it, and found that there is a connection between the tension of the string and the string
 pita ke dwaara sangeet ke liye tani huyi dori yaa taar se nikalne vaali dhvaniyon ke antarasambandhon ke parinaamon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan unke putr galileo dwaara kiya gaya
 During the course of this study, the child Galileo was inspired to assimilate his results by doing a thorough experiment in his mind
 inako pariksha mulak vigyaan kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He gave the oscillation formula
 inhone doorabeen kaa avishkaar kiya
 He made the visionary device more advanced
 uski sahaayta se anek khagoleey prekshan liye tathaa copernicus ke siddhanth kaa samarthan kiya
 He is considered the father of modern experimental astronomy
 unhone paaya ki prakruti ke niyam ek duusare karkon se prabhavit hote hai or kisi ek ke badhane or ghatane ke bich ganit ke samikarnon jaise hi sambandh hote he
 That is why he said: - 'the language of God is mathematics
 ‘is mahaan ganitagya or vaigyanik ne hi prakaash kii gati ko naapane kaa saahas kiya
 For this, Galileo and one of his assistants sat on two mountain peaks located several miles away in the dark night
 jahaan se galileo ne laalaten jalaakar rakhi, apane sahaayak kaa sanket paane ke baad unhen laalaten or uske khatke ke madhyam se prakaash kaa sanket dena tha
 His assistant on the second hill had to see the light of the lantern and remove the sign of the second lantern kept near him
 is prakaar duusari pahaad kii chotii par chamakate prakaash ko dekhakar galileo ko prakaash kii gati kaa akalan karnaa tha
 Thus, the results that Galileo achieved were not real to a large extent, but the frequency and success of the experiments, the failure to achieve the desired results only after the failure was unique
 kaalaantar main prakaash kii gati or urja ke sambandhon kii jatil gulthi ko sulajhane vaale mahaan vaigyanik albert ainstin ne isi kaaran unhen ‘aadhunik vigyaan kaa pita ‘ ke naam se sambodhit kiya
 Galileo was religious but wanted to sidestep the old religious beliefs through rationality and experimentation
 varsh 1609 main galileo ko ek aisi doorabeen kaa pataa chalaa jiskaa avishkaar holland main hua tha, is doorabeen kii sahaayta se duurastha khagoleey pindon ko dekh kar unki gati kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa tha
 Galileo himself heard this and built a telescope that was more powerful than the indiscriminate telescope in Holland
 iske aadhaar par apane prekshan tathaa prayogon ke madhyam se galileo ne yah paaya ki purv main vyaapt manyataon ke vipareet brihamand main sthit prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he
 Earlier, Copernicus also said that all the planets including the Earth revolve around the Sun, for which they had to be angry with the Church
 ab prayog ar vivek par aadhaarit parinaamon ke aadhaar par galiliye ne bhi yahi hona sidv paaya
 Till that time, it was universally accepted that the Earth is located in the center of the universe and all the celestial bodies including the sun and the moon revolve around the earth continuously
 is manyata ko tadsamay ke dharmacharyon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Due to the results obtained on the basis of his experiments, Galileo decided to stand against the old concepts
 jab galileo ne yah sidwant saarvajanik kiya to carch ne ise apni avagya mana or is avagya ke liye galileo ko carch kii ore se karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 The idea given by Galileo forced the new man to accept a new form of direction of contemplation
 saamaajik or dharmik pratadna ke chalate purv se vyaapt manyataon or vishwaason ke vipareet pratipaadit sindvanto ke saath ve adhik din tak khadey nahin rah sake
 In 1633, 69-year-old Old Galileo was ordered by the Church to publicly apologize, saying that his doctrine against religious beliefs was the biggest mistake of his life for which he is ashamed
 unhone aisa hi kiya parantu iske baad bhi unhen karawas main daal diya gaya
 His health continued to deteriorate and due to this, the sentence of imprisonment was changed to house-imprisonment i
e
 imprisonment in his own house
 apane jivan kaa aakhri din bhi unhone isi kaid main hi bitaayaa
 The supreme institution of Christianity, always under the supervision of the Pope, in Vatican City, admitted in 1992 that he had made a mistake in deciding Galileo's case
 is prakaar ek mahaan khagol vigyaani, ganitagya, bhautikavid evam darshanik galileo ke sambandh main 1633 main jari aadesh kar apni aitihaasik bhul sweekaar karne main carch ko saade teen sau saalon se bhi adhik kaa samay laga
 Four hundred years after the creation of binoculars and the observation of celestial bodies in the year 1609, the year 400 was celebrated as the International Year of Astronomy as the 400th birth anniversary and paid tribute to this great scientist and tried to make a mistake
