 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation
 purakalin isaayiyon main yah isamsih kii sachhee saadagi or gaurav vyakt karanevaale girjagharon ke nirmaan ke prati baari utsaah ke rup main tha; gothic nirmaataaon main yah sanrachana yantriki ke gyaan se yukt utkar shakti thi; italvi punaruddhar main yah us yug kii vidvatta thi
 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory

 Even today, we keep looking for the most suitable forms for talented people
 aaj kuch aise vaastu hai jo bhoot kaa anusaran karne main hi santusht hai kuch anya hai jo videshi dhang kaa anukaran karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 There are very few who are trying to develop Vastu according to their time, pace and national vision
 is chote se varg kaa prayaas nayaa sanghaat prastut karne kaa he, jo manushya kaa nae vichaar sochane or dhaaran karne kii prerana detaa he
 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies

 In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution, Finland declared independence and most of the Åland Islands were thought to re-join Sweden
 The Finnish government, however, felt that the islands could be part of their new nation, because in 1809, the Russians included Åland in the Grand Dutch of Finland

 In 1924 a League of Nations Commission of Inquiry with members from Belgium, Hungary and Sweden was sent to study the region which found that the people of Mosul did not want to be a part of Turkey and if they were asked to choose Iraq they would Choose
 In 1925, the Commission recommended that the region remain part of Iraq, with the condition that the British would have a mandate on Iraq for the next 25 years to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population
 The League Council accepted the recommendation and on 16 December 1925 decided to give Mosul to Iraq

 In addition, it also clarifies how the League of Nations can be affected by the selfishness of its members; Britain and France also feared a possible alliance between Mussolini and German dictator Hitler due to the ban not being too harsh

 Article eight of the League's covenant gave the League the task to "limit armament to the lowest point that is necessary for national security and the enforcement of international obligations by normal action
" Much of the Union's time and energy was devoted to disarmament, although many member governments were unsure whether such widespread disarmament could be achieved, or even whether it was desirable

 The Union Covenant specified the Union to prepare a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council delegated this responsibility to the Special Commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the World Disarmament Conference of 1932–34

 The threat of invasion was further heightened by Germany regaining power after World War I, especially when Hitler gained power and became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, particularly because of Germany's attempt to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German army
 France became reluctant to disarm

 In 1933, Japan, instead of accepting the decision of the Union, easily disengaged from it, as did Germany in 1933 and Italy in 1937
 In Denzing, the Union Commissioners were unable to consider the German claim on the city, which in 1939 became an important reason for the outbreak of World War II

 The onset of World War II showed that the League had failed in its initial objective, which would have avoided any future world war
 Various factors were responsible for this failure, many of which were linked to general weaknesses within the organization
 atirikt rup se, america dwaara sangh main shaamil hone kii manaahi ne sanghathan kii shakti ko simit kiya
 The emergence of the League as an organization was carried out by the Allies as part of peace efforts to end World War i and was therefore seen as a "union of Conquerors"

 Representation in the union was often a problem

 The most notable absence was the possibility of America's role in the League, not only would it secure world peace and security but also finance the Union
 US President Woodrow Wilson was the driving force behind the creation of the Union and strongly influenced its size, but the American Senate voted on 19 November 1919 not to join it
 routh heaning ne suzav diya ki yadi america sangh kaa sadsy hota to, isane france evam britain ko bhi prishth-samarthan diya hota, sambhavatya france zyada surakshit mahasoos karata evam aisa protsaahan france evam britain ko germany ke sambandh main zyada sahyog karne detaa evam isse naaji party kaa udai kam sambhav hota
 Conversely, Henning acknowledges that if the US had been a member of the Union, its reluctance to engage in war with European powers and enacting economic sanctions would have impeded the Union's ability to withstand international events
 america main sarkaar kii sanrachana ne bhi isaki sadsyata ko samasyapurna banaaya hota kyonki sangh main iske pratinidhigan america kaaryakari shakhaon kii taraf se isaki vidhai shakhaon kii purv anumati ke bina koi nirnay nahin liya gaya hota
 In January 1920, when the Confederacy began, Germany was not allowed to join as it was seen as offensive in the First World War
 soviet rus bhi prarambh main sangh se bahishkrut tha, kyonki pratham vishwa yuddh ke vijetaon ko communist vichaar pasand nahin tha
 The League was further weakened when important powers abandoned it in the 1930s
 japan ne sthaayee sadsy ke rup main parishad main shuru kiya, lekin 1933 main tab hat gaya jab sangh ne iske china ke manchuriya kshetra par akraman kaa virodh kiya
 Italy also started as a permanent member of the council but withdrew in 1937
 sangh ne germany ko 1926 main sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya, ise “shanti premi desh” mana, lekin adolf hitler 1933 main jab satta main aayaa to germany ko isse alag kar liya
 Another significant weakness developed from the contradiction between the idea of collective security, which was the basis of the League and international relations between individual nations
 samuhik suraksha pranali jise sangh ne prayukt kiya, kaa arth tha ki rashtron ke liye aavashyak tha ki ve un rajyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi karen jinhen ve mitra maanate hai or is tareeke se un rajyon kaa samarthan jinke saath saamaanya ghanishthata nahin thi, unke rashtriya hiton ko khatra ho saktaa he
 This weakness became evident at the time of the Abyssinia crisis when Britain and France had to make balanced efforts to maintain security in Europe, which they had built for themselves "to maintain order against the enemy of internal order" in Europe, in which Italy's support played a major role, with Abyssinia being obliged to remain a member of the Union

 In addition, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was denying itself deception by the powerful means by which its authority would be upheld

 When the British Cabinet discussed the concept of the Union during the First World War, the Cabinet Secretary, Maurice Hankey, sent a memorandum on the subject
 usne yah kehete hue shuru kiya: "aam taur par mujhe aisa lagata he ki aisi koi yojana hamaare liye khatarnaak he, kyonki yah suraksha kaa bodh karaayegaa jo puri tarah se kaalpanik he
 It delusionally attacked the pre-war faith of the British in the sanctity of the settlement and concluded with the claim
 videsh karyaalay mantri sar ir kro ne bhi british cabinet ko ek gyaapan likhaa jisamen vah daawa kar rahe hai ki "ek gambhir sangh or anubandh" bas "duusari sandhiyon kii tarah ek sandhi" maatr hogi : "aisa kya he vahanjo yah sunishchit kare ki yah duusari sandhiyon kii tarah nahi tuutegi?"

 The most effective propaganda is one whose content is often completely true, but it may also contain a small amount of false, half-truth or logical fallacy
 adhiprachaar ke bahut se tareeke hai
 The purpose of propaganda is to influence people's behavior and opinions rather than giving information
 propaganda kaa hindi main shabdic arth he prachaar, adhiprachaar athwa mat-prachaar
 Propaganda is done to propagate an idea and point of view, for a particular purpose, especially under a political purpose
 lekin isaki buniyaad aam taur par satya par nahin tiki hoti
 Propaganda began as a henchman to morally defeat the enemy's army during the war
 iske baad zikr miltaa he ki 1622 main pandrahawein pope gregory ne vatican main protestant sudhaaron ke kilaaf propaganda kaa kaam sanbhaala tha
 Propaganda's image became negative when the British government systematically propagated its letter of political interests during World War I
 kalantar main iskaa upyog chunaav-prachaar ke liye bhi hone laga
 Initially, it was used during political campaigns to attract support in the interest of the candidate
 tatpashchaat isaki upyogita samajhate hue iskaa vistaar hua or ise vigyaapan kaa bhi ang bana liya gaya
 Propaganda also had a positive side when it came to advertising
 vah bhaawanaaon ko sparsh karne vaale ek sukhad ehsaas ke vaahak kii bhoomika nibhaane laga or ek khaas sandarbh main rachanaatmak ho gaya
 The basis of the information provided by Propaganda has always been negative rather than historically positive
 iske madhyam se di jane vaali jaankaree praayah ek tarfaa or bhraamak prakruti kii hoti he
 Propaganda was used to promote a particular viewpoint for political reasons
 aaj propaganda kaa falak kaafii vyapak ho gaya he or iskaa upyog jaan-boojh kar kisi vyakti, sanstha, raashtra, utpaada athwa kisi raajnneetik party ke bare main nakaaratmak soochna failaane ke liye kiya jane laga he
 The other side of propaganda is that it is also seen as a special type of message
 ek aise sandesh ke rup main jise kisi vishesh samskruti, darshan, vichaar athwa mat ko kisi naare aadi ke madhyam se bazaar or samaaj main prachlit karne ke liye kiya prachaarit jaataa he
 Propaganda has been used to prove lies to be true during war
 america is propaganda kaa sabase bada prayokta mana jaataa he
 He always spreads the news during the war that he is fighting to protect humanity and fight terrorism, when his motive is something else
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan pichley do dashakon main hue iraq or afghanistan ke yudhon main dekhne ko mila
 The US has always maintained that it was necessary to fight terrorism, while the fact was that it was carrying an army of journalists who were on its side or who had been bought, along with its soldiers
 ye patrkaar apni khabaron ko live dikhaane ke naam par aisi jaankaree kaa prasaaran karte rahe jo sach nahin thi
 Such journalism itself is called jaded journalism or embedded journalism
 is tarah kii patrakarita main ek paksh kii ichha ke anusaar reporting kii jaati he or sach ko gaayab kar diya jaataa he
 Many times this journalism is also used by political parties to create public opinion in their favor
 kuch sanchaarshastriyon kii manyata he ki propaganda kaa udbhav jan-sanchaar madhyamon ke vikaas ke baad hua
 They consider it as part of communication that communication to attract public opinion is a form of propaganda
 yahan sanchaar or propegande ke sambandh par gaur karnaa zaruri he
 The invention of radio in the early twentieth century gave Propaganda a special boom
 radio ke madhyam se kaafii kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak apni baat ko pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 The development of radio not only worked to spread self-motivated and sponsored information, but it also originated the advertisement whose developed forms are in front of us in various forms today
 radio ke vikaas ke pehle itane kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak sidhe-taur par apni baat pahunchaa paanaa asambhav sa tha
 It is of course that information could also be communicated directly through the print medium, but the readers of newspapers were few
 pathak banane ke saath sakshartaa kii shart bhi judi hui thi
 Radio unveiled a new world of advertising where reading ability was not necessary
 isse vigyaapan kii pahunch or prabhaav kaa dayera aseemit ho gaya
 Along with advertising, political propaganda also expanded very rapidly
 radio ke baad propaganda ko tivi ke aagaman ne ek or nayaa oochaal diya
 TV was not able to overthrow radio, but its credibility was more authentic than radio
 badi-badi companiyon ne jab apane utpaadon ko badha-chadha kar pesh kiya to logon ne us prachaar main apni chhavi dekhni shuru kar di
 That is why advertising guru Alec Padmasi once said that when people of India become customers of something, they become less than logic and more than emotion
 unhone liril sabun ke vigyaapan kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki ‘aapako kya lagata he yah jo ladki bikni pahanakar jharne main nahaati he or neembu kii khushboo ke ehsaas jaisi tarotaza mahasoos karti he, to vah kya sachmuch vaastavik bharat ke gaanvon or shaharon main sambhav he? jahaan ek baaltee pani dhang se nahaane ke liye naseeb hota, vahaan vah neembu kii khushboo vaale ehsaas kaa anubhav kaise ho saktaa he?’ isi aadhaar par padmasi kehete hai ki vigyaapan propaganda ke madhyam se upabhokta ke saamne ek aisi chhavi nirmit kar detaa he jisamen upabhokta apni chhavi dekhne lagate hai
 In recent years, the invention of the Internet and e-mail gave Propaganda a global expansion
 masalan web-madhyamon main vah takat he jo sthaneey mudde ko vaishvik mudda bana sakati he
 Web-mediums have violated all the boundaries of geography and transformed the entire world into a small village
 kshan bhar main local se global ho jane ke liye logon ne internet pranali kaa jam kar laabh uthaaya he
 The most powerful example of how a local singer and local music has become the most popular music via the Internet in a short time is the song called Kolaberry Dee
 marketing kii bhashaa main jise ham viral marketing ke naam se jaanate hai darasal vah media kii bhashaa main propaganda hi he
 On the one hand propaganda is seen as a medium to present negative things in a positive way and on the other hand propaganda is a skill of propaganda in which a subject is presented in such a way that people are attracted towards it
 Go sambandhit vishay ko ek aisi bhashaa, lay or sangeet ke madhyam se prastut kiya jaae ki aam upabhokta apnaapan mahasoos karke us utpaada ke saath jud jaataa he
 For this, various media mediums are used
 jaise : television, radio, binar, internet, billboard, ligalet ityadi
 The negative side in this role of giving touch to emotions is only that such propaganda destroys the rationality of man and makes the emotional side more effective in his place
 america ke ek vigyaapan-lekhak tristrian toliver ne propaganda ke bare main kaha he : main hameshaa apane bare main yahi sochataa hoon ki aapako log isliye nahin pasand karte ki aapane kya kiya or unke liye kya kiya
 Rather you are always remembered for what you made them feel through your words
 masalan propaganda main yah baat bahut myne nahin rakhti kii kisi baat ko aapane kitne achche tareeke se rakhaa balki sabase mahatvapurn cheez hoti he usase nikalne vaali vah anubhuti or prerana jo logon par apni chhap chhod jaae
 The pleasant feeling of propaganda has the ability to be remembered for a long time
 is lihaaz se vigyaapan main propaganda kaa istemaal use sirf nakaaratmak na ban kar sakaaratmak rup bhi dene laga he
 According to this aspect Propaganda is the name of an entire process based on the concept of creative nature
 iskaa upyog kis prakaar se kiya janaa he— yah puri tarah upbhogakarta par nirbhar karata he
 Anti-capitalist color french postcard : pratham vishwayuddh ke samay main germany ke wilhem dwitiya ko dharti ko munh se katate hue dikhaaya gaya he
 America's propaganda poster against Hitler in World War II 'soye hue hathi uth ja' : japani poster jisamen aaazaad hind fouj ko hathi ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jisane soond se jon bul ko hawa main uthaa liya he

 Nikolai Gogol was a Russian writer of Ukraine origin who has written well in the genres of story, short novel and drama, as per the requirements of the era
 gogol roosi sahitya main pragatisheel vichaardhaara ke aarambhik prayogkartaaon main pramukh the va unki saahitiyik praathamikta janonmukhataa kaa paryaay thi
 In the early writings, despite the excess of love element, Gogol very soon shifted towards the comprehensiveness and depth of multi-dimensional depiction of social life
 mirgorod main sankalit kahaniyaan is tathy kaa jeevant sakshya hai
 The poignant portrayal of anomalies and irony in compositions compiled in the stories of Petersburg is wonderful through humor and subtle satire; And their great feature is to influence the general public as well as an entire generation of writers
 kahaniyon ke saath-saath naatakon ke madhyam se gogol kaa mukhya prakaarya yugin aavashyaktaaon ko is prakaar sahitya main dhaalnaa rahaa he jisase jan-saamaanya kii sthiti main parivartankaree bhoomika nibhaane ke saath-saath vastutah sahitya kii 'saahitiyikta' bhi surakshit rahe, or isamen aalochakon ne use safal mana he
 Nikolai Gogol was born on March 20, 1809 in a family of landowners of Ukraine
 unke pita bhi uttam shiksha praapt vyakti the tathaa kavitaayen evam hasya bhi likhte the
 In addition, he also acted in theater
 apane pita ke in gunon ke kaaran gogol ko bachapan se sahitya ke saath-saath rangamanch ke prati bhi abhiruchi jag gayi
 While studying at the Gymnasium, Gogol also acted at the theater
 gogol kii shiksha ke samay gupt rup se abhijaat varg ke bich pragatisheel svachhndathawadi vichaaron kaa udai evam prasar bhi aarambh ho chukaa tha
 The Gymnasium also had a team of progressive teachers headed by Beloussov
 1820i0 main zaar sarkaar ke dwaara in par abhiyog lagaaya gaya tathaa isi sambandh main vidhyaarthee bhi bulaaye gayi
 At this time Gogol made a statement in favor of Belausov
 belausov ke vyakhyanon ke atirikt pushkin, rilyev tathaa anya pragativaadiyon kii rachanaaon ne bhi gogol ke pragatisheel drushtikon ke nirmaan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In 1828, after finishing his gymnasium, Gogol moved to Petersburg
 petersburg jate hue gogol apana romantic kavy maas kukhel gartan bhi chipa kar le gayi the
 He wanted Pushkin's advice on this work, but it could not be possible and it was severely criticized after the publication of this work and as a result Gogol burnt all copies of it
 petersburg main aarambh main ve asafal hi rahe
 His desire to become an actor in the Alexandra theater was also not fulfilled and with great difficulty he got a small staff job in a department
 vahaan kaam karte hue vah shaam ko kala academy main jaaya karte the or chitrakala sikhte the
 In 1830, the first story of Gogol appeared before Ivan Kupal without an authoritative name
 kuch samay uparaant unhone naukari chhodkar puraa dhyaan saahitiyik kriyakalapon main hi lagaana aarambh kiya
 On 20 May 1831, Gogol was introduced to Pushkin
 1831 i0 main gogol ke kahani sangrah dikanka ke paas gramin sandhyaayein kaa pehla bhaag prakashit hua tathaa 1832 i0 main iskaa doosraa bhaag niklaa
 The work was well received by the readers as well as critics
 is sangrah main may kii raat, bhayanak badla jaisi kahaniyaan bhi sankalit thim, jo kaaphi prasiddh huin
 In the stories compiled in this collection, Gogol has depicted various aspects of Ukraine's younger generation through comical subtle satire
 gogol kaa mukhya dhyey vyangy ke madhyam se yuva peedi kii durbalataaon evam visangatiyon ko ujagar karte hue unhen dur karne kaa sandesh dena rahaa he
 In these stories there is Manikanchan Yoga of reality and imagination, and its biggest feature is people oriented
 in rachanaaon main janata kii aatma, uskaa maansik paksh, uskaa charitra tathaa uske jivan kaa kavyatv sab kuch surakshit he
 In 1835, Gogol's new story collection Mirgorod was published
 isamen agle vakton ke jameendaar, taras bulba, evan evanovich kaa evan nickefrovich se jhagada jaisi prasiddh lambii kahaniyaan bhi sankalit thim
 The depiction of life in these stories is more extensive and deep and there is less love for folklore
 gogol ne in rachanaaon main jameendaaron ke maanviya evam parsparik prempurna charitra tathaa andruni jivan kii vidambnaaon evam khokhalepan -- donon pakshon kaa shashakt chithran kiya he
 The long story titled Taras Bulba depicts the brave past of independent kajakas depicting the life of the zamindars in the face of narrow lives
 katha ke centre main apane desh ke liye ladane vaala taras bulba he jo apane deshadrohi putr ko bhi mrityudand dene main sankoch nahin karata he
 This story is the public administration of life
 in rachanaaon ke liye roosi samalochak belinsky ne gogol ko sahitya ke netaa, kaviyon ke netaa kaa abhidhaan diya tha
 In 1835 A
D
, Gogol's new story collection Aravesky was published, compiling stories such as Nevsky Prospect, Pic, Mad's Comments
 baad main likhi gayi naak tathaa overkot jaisi kahaniyon ko milakar in sab kahaniyon ko petersburg kii kahaniyaan ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya
 Gogol's folklore has been quite extensive in these stories
 rajdhani kaa jivan, swapndarshi kalakaar kaa jivan, garib karmchaaree kaa jivan aadi ke rup main gogol ne janajivan kaa bahuaiami tathaa maarmik chithran kiya
 The poignant portrayal of life's anomalies and irony through humor and subtle satire is amazing in these compositions
 hansee ke vaataavaran main maarak chot ke madhyam se swatah udbhoot samaadhaan ke sanket gogol kii kala ko vishisht banaate hai
 It is for these reasons that Belinsky called Gogol's satire 'laughter among tears'
 gogol kaa overkot kitna lokapriy hua tha tathaa baad ke sahityakaron par uskaa kaisaa prabhaav padaa tha yah jaanane ke liye ek hi udhaaharan paryaapt hoga ki rus main turganeb ke daur ke tamaam kathakaar kehete the ki ham gogol ke overkot se nikle hai
 In 1835–36, there was an intimacy between Gogol and Pushkin
 pushkin dwaara prakashit patr 'samakaleen' main gogol sahyog dene laga
 The theme of his famous compositions 'the Government Inspector' and 'the Dead Souls' was received from Pushkin itself
 'inspector' ke bare main gogol ne swayan sweekaar kiya he ki usamen maine rus kii sari buraaiyon ko, jinase ki main avgat hum, ek jagah ekatrit karne kaa nishchay kiya he, tathaa un saare anyaayon ko, jo ki un jagahon or sthitiyon main kaye jate hai, jahaan manushya se sabase adhik nyaay kii maang kii jaati he, or in sab par ek saath hansane kaa nishchay kiya he
 People of progressive ideology were pleased with the performance of this comedy, but the reactionaries were very angry and demanded to seize the play by calling it an unrestrained attack on the employees
 in baton se gogol kaaphi pareshaan hua tathaa uskaa swasthya bhi kharaab ho gaya
 In such a situation, Gogol went on a foreign trip in 1836 to get some peace and pay attention to the writing of 'dead souls'
 kuch samay tak paris main rahane ke baad vah rome main bas gaya tha or prakaashan-kaary hetu hi kabhi-kabhi rus aata tha
 The first part of dead souls was completed in 1841
 kaaphi kathinaayee ke baad iskaa prakaashan ho paaya
 This creation made Gogol immortal
 vyangy ke put ke baavjood is gambhir upanyaas main gogol ne samagrata main rus kaa jivan chitrit kiya tathaa tatkaaleen yug kii samast trutiyon evam buraaiyon kaa atyant vyapak evam gambhir chithran kiya
 By presenting a nude portrait of the Russian life of the then era, Geranson called the dead souls a scream of tragedy and shame, and Belinsky considered it the most important literary work of that era
 purvavarnit rachanaaon ke atirikt maniloi, karovochaka, 'najdrev', 'savakevitch', 'plushkin', chichikove' aadi ke rup main bhi gogol ne apni rachanaatmak samarthy kaa parichay diya he
 Through his compositions, Gogol laid the foundation for 'critical realism' in Russian literature
 gogol kii rachanaayen vishwa kii anek bhashaaon main, jinamein hindi bhi sammilit he, anudit hui hai

 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma

 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal

 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai

 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire

 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically
 jaise newton ke pehle bhi gurutvkarshan kaa bal kaary karata tha kintu newton ne uganukool shabdaawalee dekar ise vishwa ko "gurutvkarshan ke niyam" ke ghoshit siddhanton se avgat karaayaa, jo newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 
 Shreemadbhagvatgeeta ka bhashya sambhavatah sanskrit ke vyakaranacharya paanini krit astadhayi se prerit hai parantu vibhinah purva ke paandulipi ke samuchit adhyan dwara vishesh arth nikala ja sakta hai
 Sampoorna Bhagwat Geeta PDF in Hindi and Sanskrit budh, soramandal ke aath grahon main sabase chota or surya se nikatatam he
 Its rotation period is about 88 days
 prithvi se dekhne par, yah apni kaksha ke irdgird 116 divaso main ghumta najar aata he jo ki grahon main sabase tej he
 Since its atmosphere is almost negligible in order to retain heat, Mercury's crust feels the most fluctuating temperature of all planets, ranging from 100 k nighttime to 700 k at daytime in equatorial regions
 
 vahiin dhruvon ke taapmaana sthaayee rup se 180 k ke neeche he
 The tilt of the axis of Mercury is lower than any other planet in the Solar System, but the orbital decentralization is the highest
 budh grah apsur par upsaur kii tulana main surya se kareeb 1
5 guna zyada dur hota he
 The Earth of Mercury is lined with craters and looks exactly like our moon, which indicates that it has been geologically dead for years
 budh ko prithvi jaise anya grahon ke samaan mausamon kaa koi bhi anubhav nahin he
 It is fastened so its path of rotation is unique in the solar system
 kisi sthir khadey sitare ke saapeksh dekhne par, yah har do kakshiya pradakshina ke darmyaan apni dhuri ke irdgird thik teen baar gum letaa he
 From the Sun's side, in a frame of reference that rotates at an orbital speed, it is seen to rotate only once every two years
 is kaaran budh grah par koi paryvekshak ek diwas harek do varshon kaa dekhegaa
 Since Mercury's orbit lies within the Earth's orbit, it can appear in the Earth's sky in the morning or in the evening, but not at midnight
 prithvi ke saapeksh apni kaksha par safar karte hue yah shukr or hamaare chandramaa kii tarah kalaon ke sabhi rupon kaa pradarshan karata he
 Although Mercury may look like a very bright object when viewed from Earth, its proximity to the Sun makes it more difficult to see than Venus
 budh grah soramandal ke chaar sthaliy grahon main se ek he, tathaa yah prithvi ke samaan ek chattani pind he
 It is the smallest planet in the solar system with an equatorial radius of 2,439
7 km
 budh grah soramandal ke bade upgrahon genimad or titan se bhi chota he, haalanki yah unase baari he
 Mercury is made up of about 70% metal and 30% silicate material
 budh kaa 5
427 gram / semi3 kaa ghanatv soramandal main ucchtam ke duusare kram par he, yah prithvi ke 5
515 gram / semi3 ke ghanatv se maatr thoda sa kam he
 If the effect of gravitational compression is divided into factors, then the material the Mercury is made of will be the densest, with an uncoordinated density of 5
3 g / cm3 vs
 4
4 g / cm3 of Earth
 budh kaa ghanatv iske andruni gathan ke vivaran ke anumaan ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 The Earth's high density is high due to its strong gravitational compression, especially the core, as opposed to Mercury being very small and its inner regions not as compressed
 isliye, is tarah ke kisi ucch ghanatv ke liye, iskaa kor bada or louh se samrudh avashya hona chahie
 Geologists estimate that Mercury's core occupies about 42% of its volume; This ratio for the Earth is 17%
 anusandhan bataate he ki budh kaa ek dravit kor he
 The core is surrounded by a 500–700 km silicate mantle
 meriner 10 ke mishan se mili aankado or bhooaadhaarit prekshanon ke aadhaar par budh kii parpati kaa 100–300 kimi motaa hona mana gaya he
 a distinctive topography of Mercury Earth is the presence of numerous narrow ridges that span several hundred kilometers in length
 yah mana gaya he ki ye tab nirmit hui thi jab budh ke kor va mental thik us samay thande or sankuchit kiye gaye jab parpati pehle se hi jam chuki thi
 Mercury's core is of higher iron content than any other large planet in the solar system, and several theories have been proposed to explain this
 sarvaadhik vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya gaya siddhant yah he ki budh aam kondrite ulkapind kii tarah hi mul rup se ek dhaatu-silicket anupaat rakhata tha, jo ki soramandal ke chattani padaarth main durlabh samajha gaya, saath hi dravyaman iske maujuuda dravyaman kaa kareeb 2
25 guna mana gaya
 Prior to the history of the Solar System, the planet Mercury may have been hit by an asteroid several hundred kilometers wide and about 1 / 6 in mass
 takkar ne mul parpati va mental ke adhikansh bhaag ko dur chhitak diya hoga or peeche apekshaakrit mukhya ghatak ke rup main ek kor ko chhoda hoga
 a similar process, known as the giant collision hypothesis, has been proposed to explain the formation of the moon
 grahiy pranali namakaran ke kaary samooh ne budh par paanch ghaatiyon ke liye nae naamon ko manjuuri di he: angkore ghati, kaihokiya ghati, kairal ghati, paayestem ghati, timgade ghati 
 According to the Roman myths, Mercury is the messenger of the gods, the Roman form of the Greek god Hermes, the god of trade, travel and pilgrimage
 ise sandeshvahak devtaa kaa naam is kaaran mila kyonki yah grah akaash main kaaphi teji se gaman karata he
 Mercury has been known since Sumerian times 3 millennia before Christ
 ise kabhi suryoday kaa tara, kabhi suryaast kaa tara kaha jaataa rahaa he
 Greek astronomers knew that these two names belong to the same planet
 heraclites yahaan tak maanata tha ki budh or shukr prithvi kii nahi, surya kii parikrama karte he
 Mercury is closer to the Sun than the Earth, so the Earth shows its moons like a moon
 galileiyo kii doorabeen choti thi jisase ve budh kii kalaye dekh nahin paye lekin unhone shukr kii kalaayen dekhi thi
 Mercury has a remarkable and global magnetic field, despite its small size and 59-day-long slow rotation
 meriner 10 dwaara liye gaye maapnon ke anusaar yah prithvi kii tulana main lagbhag 1
1% sarvashaktishaalee he
 The strength of this magnetic field is about 300 nt at the equinox of Mercury
 prithvi kii tarah budh kaa bhi chumbakeey kshetra do dhruviya he
 Unlike Earth, the pole of Mercury is roughly in line with the rotational axis of the planet
 antariksh yaan meriner-10 va messanger donon se mili maapnon ne darshaya he ki chumbakeey kshetra kaa aakaar va shakti sthaayee he
 This magnetic field appears to have been generated by a dynamo effect
 is lihaaj se yah prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra ke samaan he
 This dynamo effect may have been the result of the circulation of the planet's iron-rich liquid core
 vishesh rup se grah kii ucch kakshiya vicendratha dwaara uptann shaktishaalee jwariya prabhaav ne kor ko taral avasthaa main rakhaa hoga jo ki dynamo prabhaav ke liye aavashyak he
 Mercury's magnetic field is powerful enough to bend the solar wind around the planet, creating a magnetosphere
 is grah kaa magnetosphere, yadhyapi prithvi ke bheetar samaa jane jitna chota he, par saura vaayu plasma ko fansane ke liye paryaapt majboot he
 This contributes to the space weathering of the planet's surface
 meriner 10 antariksh yaan dwaara kiye nirikshanon ne grah ke raatri-paksh ke magnetosphere main is nimna urja plasma kaa pataa lagaaya
 The eruption of energetic particles was detected in the planet's magnetic doom, indicating a dynamic quality of the planet's magnetosphere
 6 oktober 2008 ko grah ke apane duusare flibai ke dauraan messanger yaan ne pataa lagaaya ki budh kaa chumbakeey kshetra atyant "risaav" vaala ho saktaa he
 The spacecraft encountered magnetic "tornadoes" - twisted bundles of magnetic fields that connect planetary magnetic fields to interplanetary space - that were up to 800 km or a third of the planet's radius
 chumbakeey kshetra saura vaayu dwaara budh ke chumbakeey kshetra se sampark ke liye jab dhoya jaataa, ye "bavandar" banate
 The process of connecting planetary magnetic fields to interplanetary space, which is a common process in the universe, is called magnetic reunion
 yah dharti ke chumbakeey kshetra main bhi utpann hoti he jahaan ye chumbakeey bavandar ke had tak ban jaati he
 According to Messenger satellite calculations, the process of magnetic reunification on the planet Mercury is about 10 times faster
 budh grah kii surya se adhik nikatataa, messenzar dwaara maape gayi uske chumbakeey punarmilan kii gati ke sirf tihaai hisse kaa kaarak thi
 Mercury's orbit is the most flat among all the planets
 isaki kakshiya vicendratha 0
21 he
 Its distance from the Sun is thought to range from 46,000,000 to 70,000,000 km
 ek purna parikrama ke liye ise 87
969 prithvi diwas lagate hai
 The right-hand side diagram shows the effect of decentralization, with the Mercury orbit appearing above a circular orbit while their semi-principal axis is equal
 abhi tak do antariksh yaan mariner 10 tathaa macenjar budh grah ja chuke he
 Mariner- 10 has traveled to this planet thrice between 1974 and 1975
 budh grah kii sataha ke 45% hisse kaa nakshaa banaaya ja chukaa he
 The Messenger vehicle was launched by NASA in 2004
 isane 2011 main budh grah kii parikrama kii
 Earlier in January 2008, the vehicle had sent high quality pictures of the area not seen by Mariner 10
 budh kii kaksha kaaphi zyada vikendrit he, isaki surya se duuri 46,000,000 kimi se 70,000,000 kimi tak rahati he
 When Mercury is near the Sun, its speed is very slow
 19 ve shatabdi main khagolashastriyon ne budh kii kaksha kaa saavdhaanee se nirikshan kiya tha lekin newton ke niyamon ke aadhaar par ve budh kii kaksha ko samaj nahin paa rahe the
 Mercury's orbit does not follow Newton's rules
 nirikshit kaksha or gananaa kii gayi kaksha main antar chota tha lekin dashako tak pareshaan karanevaala tha
 It was previously thought that there could be another planet inside Mercury's orbit, which is influencing Mercury's orbit
 kaaphi nirikshan ke baad bhi aisa koi grah nahin paaya gaya
 This mystery was solved long after by Einstein's theory of simple relativism
 budh kii kaksha kii sahi gananaa is siddhant ke sweekaran kii ore pehla kadam tha
 Till 1962, it was thought that Mercury's day and year are equal, so that he keeps one side of the Sun towards him
 yah usee tarah tha jis tarah chandramaa kaa ek hi paksh prithvi kii ore rahata he
 But the Dappler theory proved it wrong
 ab yah mana jaataa he ki budh ke do varsh main teen din hote he
 That is, Mercury rotates three times on its axis in two revolutions of the Sun
 budh saura mandal main akelaa pind he jiskaa kaksha / ghurnan kaa anupaat 1:1 nahin he
 An observer will see strange effects on the surface of Mercury by the change in distance from the Sun in Mercury's orbit and the ratio of its orbit / rotation
 kuch akshonso par nirikshak surya ko udit hote huye dekhegaa or jaise jaise surya kshitij se upar sheersh bindu tak aayegaa uskaa aakaar badhata jaayegaa
 On coming to this top point, the sun will stop and go in the opposite direction for some time and then stop again and after changing direction, it will decrease in size and go to the horizon and sunset
 is saare samay main taare akaash main surya se tin guna teji se jate dikhaayi denge
 The observer will see different but different movements of the Sun at different places on the surface of Mercury
 budh kii sataha par taapmaana 90° kelvin se 700° kelvin tak jaataa he
 The temperature on Venus is warmer than this but is permanent
 budh par ek halkaa vaataavaran he jo mukhyatah saura vaayu se aaye parmaanuon se bana he
 Mercury is very hot due to which these atoms fly into space
 ye prithvi or shukr ke vipareet he jiskaa vaataavaran sthaayee he, budh kaa vaataavaran naveen hote rahata he
 The pits on the surface of Mercury are quite deep, a few hundred km long and three km deep
 aisa prathit hota he ki budh kii sataha lagbhag 0
1 % sankuchit huyi he
 On the surface of Mercury lies the Caloris Valley, which is about 1300 km in diameter
