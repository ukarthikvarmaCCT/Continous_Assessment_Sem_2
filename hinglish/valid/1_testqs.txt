 Many such substances are found in nature, which absorb light and emit a different type of light
 There are some substances from it, as long as there is light, they emit light till then
 Such substances are called fluorescence substances
 At the same time, there are some substances, on which the light stops, even then they continue to emit light for some time
 This phenomenon is called 'phosphorescence' and such substances are called 'phosphorescence substance'
 Zinc sulfide
 Examples of phosphorescence substances are calcium sulfide, barium sulfide, etc
 The length of time that the phosphorescence material emits light when it stops shining is called the 'phosphorylation period', which depends on the nature of the light
 The ability of phosphorescence substances is destroyed on heating
 Nowadays watch needles, sign boards, On the electrical board, etc
, paste the coating of phosphorescence material

 After that, they should wear the Sapphire of five and a half Rattis
 By doing this, the person will progress in every field, will achieve his goal soon
 Will also be able to do this, as a result of which the Jhalak and the hereafter will be meaningful
 The Dhi is intelligent, is quiet by nature, and he can keep living in difficult circumstances difficult
 jataka ko loha se jude vayavsaayon me laabh adhik hota he
 Shani does not get to know the intuition of primeval people any time soon
 jataka ke andar maanav pareekshak ke gun vidyaman hote hai
 Saturn is clever, lazy, slow-working, patient with excess coolness, he is talkative due to being lazy, and sweet-spoken to protect himself from punishment
 daampatyjivan saamaanya hota he
 Even after working hard, money and cereal is reduced
 jataka na to samay se sote hai or na hi samay se jaagate hai
 There is always a worry in his mind
 ve loha, steel, mashinari, theka, beemaa, puraane vastuon kaa vyapaar, yaa raaj kaaryon ke andar apni kaary karke apni jeevika chalaate hai
 There are some loopholes in the Shani Pradhan Jataka, like if they wear new clothes then their shoes will be old, they will start to doubt everything, will do a lot of stubbornness according to their habit, most of the views of the natives are old
 unke saamne jo bhi pareshaani hoti he sabake saamne use ujagar karne main unako koi shame nahi aati he
 Shani Pradhan Jataka often contrasts his thoughts with his brother and brothers, he always lacks wealth, diseases always flourish in his body, due to being lazy, the car of luck comes and goes to him
 There is no identification, whatever money is given by the father is wasted in most cases
 apane mitron se virodh rahata he
 And the native remains mostly deprived even of his mother's happiness
 shani ko santulan or nyaay kaa grah mana gaya he
 People who try to run their way through inappropriate things, which is not in the interest of society and try to give recognition to them, keep their own thing in the forefront because of the importance, unfair inequality, or unnatural equality
 He gives shelter, Saturn suffers them
 shani hamase kupit na ho, usase pehle hi hame samaj lenaa chaiye, ki ham kahin anyaay to nahi kar rahe hai, yaa anaavashyak vishmata kaa saath to nahi de rahe hai
 This is a planetary planet, that is, the body matures by performing austerities, the color of Saturn is dark blue, dark blue rays continuously fall on Earth from the planet Saturn
 shari main is grah kaa sthaan udar or janghaon main he
 Sun son Saturn holds sorrow over Shudra Varna, Tamas Prakriti, Tamas Prakriti, Vata Prakriti Pradhan and destitute inferior things
 shani seemaa grah kehalaata he, kyonki jahaan par surya kii seemaa samaapt hoti he, vahiin se shani kii seemaa shuru ho jaati he
 Understanding the difference between true and false in the world is the special quality of Saturn
 yah grah kshtkaarak tathaa durdaiv laane vaala he
 Along with misery, suffering, poverty, giving, there is a great teacher and teacher, as long as the creature is not out of the range of Saturn, progress in the world is not possible
 shani jab tak jataka ko peedit karata he, to chaaron taraf tabaahi machaa detaa he
 The native does not find any way to walk
 crorespati ko bhi khaakapati bana dena isaki sift he
 Good and good deeds increase the fortunes of the natives and increase their fortunes, whatever wealth or property the native earns, puts it to good use
 grihasth jivan ko sucharu rup se chalaayegaa
saath hi dharm par chalane kii prerana dekar tapasya or samadhi aadi kii taraf agrasar karata he
 If Karma is condemnable and cruel, no matter how destructive the fate of the lowly one will be, the Maha Kangali will stand up and stand still, will not even allow to die by giving it to the Bengali, the native's conscience ends soon after going against Saturn
 is
 nirnay lene kii shakti kam ho jaati he, prayaas karne par bhi sabhi kaaryon me asafalata hi haath lagati he
 Irritation comes in the nature, the job workers quarrel with the officers and colleagues, traders start suffering long financial losses
 vidhyaarthiyon kaa padhne me man nahi lagata he, baar baar anuteern hone lagate hai
 Even if the person wants, he is not able to do auspicious work
 dimagi unmaad ke kaaran un kaamon ko kar baithta he jinase karne ke baad keval pachhtaawaa hi haath lagata he
 The body swells due to rheumatism in the body, and the hands and feet do not work, due to the accumulation of stool in the anus and the digestion of what is eaten properly due to the formation of hard stool, the soft part of the anal passage i get injured, and diseases like Bhagandar arise
 ekaant vaas rahane ke kaaran se sillen or nami ke kaaran gathiya jaise rog ho jate hai, haath pair ke jodon me vaat kii thandak bhar jane se ganthon ke rog paidaa ho jate hai, sharir ke jodon main sujan aane se dard ke maare jataka ko pag pag par kathinaayee hoti he
 Muscle weakness causes weakness in the nervous system due to stretch of drugs
 adhik sochane ke kaaran or ghar parivaar ke andar klesh hone se vibhinn prakaar se nashe or maadak padaarth lene kii aadat pads jaati he, adhiktar bidi cigarette or tambaaku ke seven se kshay rog ho jaataa he, adhiktar adhik taamasi padaarth lene se cancer jaise rog bhi ho jate hai
 Due to stool deposition in the stomach, the stool gets stuck in the intestines, and ulcers like diseases occur due to blisters in the intestines
 shani aise rogon ko dekar jo dusht karm jataka ke dwaara kiye gayi hote hai, un karmon kaa bhugtan karata he
 It is Shani Dev's task to pay the full amount as the native has done
 shani kii mani neelam he
 The amount of iron in the body of an animal is more than all the metals, as the amount of iron in the body decreases, its movement becomes difficult again
 or sharir main kitne hi rog paidaa ho jate hai
 That is why the people born due to its iron deficiency do not benefit from eating the medicine, then the native should understand that Saturn is doing poorly
 shani makar tathaa kumbh raashi kaa swami he
 It is experienced in high Libra and in low Aries
 isaki dhaatu loha, anaaj chanaa, or daalon main udud kii daal maani jaati he
 Only three benches are considered to be main among the miraculous Siddha Peethas of Saturn, the person gets immediate benefit by coming down in these sins due to going to these Siddha Peethas and asking for forgiveness of sins committed by him
 jo log in chamatkaarik peethon ko kori kalpana maanate hai, uanke prati keval itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he, ki unke puraane punya karmon ke anusaar jab tak unka jivan sucharu rup se chal rahaa tabhi tak thik kaha ja saktaa he, bhavishya me jab kathinaayee saamne aayegi, to ve bhi in siddh peethon ke liye dhundte firenge, or unako bhi yaad aayegaa ki kabhi kisi ke prati makhul kiya tha
 If there was no recognition for these Siddha Peeths, intelligent people would have been born like any number of them three and a half thousand years ago, and would have died while doing their own work
 People's recognition is the same today
 shinganapur gaanv me shanidev kaa adbhut chamatkaar he
 Till date no one has locked his house in this village, it can be guessed by this how greatness is in this proven back
 aaj tak ke itihaas main kisi chor ne aakar is gaanv main chori nahi kii, agar kisi ne prayaas bhi kiya he to vah foran hi peedit ho gaya
 Visiting, worshiping, oil bathing, getting Shani Dev done instantly reduces Shani sufferings, but he only reaches here, on top of which Shani Dev is blessed
 mahavir hanumanji ke dwaara lanka se fenka hua alokik shanidev kaa pind he, shanishchari amaavashya ko yahaan mela lagata he
 And the native hugs Shani Dev by pouring oil on him
 saath hi pahane huye kapadey juute aadi vahiin par chod kar samast daridrata ko tyaag kar or cleshon ko chod kar apane apane gharon ko chale jate hai
 Even after worshiping this Peeth one gets instant fruit
 logon kii hansi karne kii aadat he
 People who did not understand listening to the Pushpak Vimana of Ramayana used to laugh, unless they themselves see Rameswaram, stones can also float in the water, there is no faith, but when going to Ramkund Visited that stone and found it floating in the water, it could not understand anything except salutations
 jab bhagwaan shri krishna kaa banshi bajaata hua ek pair se khada hua rup dekha to samaj main aayaa ki vidwaanon ne shani dev ke beej mantra main jo beej kaa achhar chunaa he, vah agar rekhaankit rup se sajaa diya jaye to vah or koi nahi swayan shanidev ke rup me bhagwaan shri krishna hi maane jaayenge
yah siddh peeth kosi se chha: kilometre dur or nand gaanv se sata hua kokila van he, is van main dwapar yug main bhagwaan shri krishna jo solah kala sampoorn ishwar hai, ne shani ko kahawaton or puraanon kii kathaon ke anusaar darshan diya, or aashirwad bhi diya ki yah van unka he, or jo is van kii parikrama karegaa, or shanidev kii puja archana karegaa, vah meri krupa kii tarah se hi shanidev kii krupa praapt kar sakegaa
or jo bhi jataka is shani siddh peeth ke prati darshan, puja paath kaa antermukhi hokar sadbhaavna se vishwaas karegaa, vah bhi shani ke kisi bhi updrav se grast nahi hoga
yahaan par shanivaar ko mela lagata he
 The Jataka performs a Dandavat Parikrama in his own devotion, or does a Parikrama, those who revolve by reciting Shani Dev's King Dasharatha Stotra, or chanting the seed mantra of Shani, early attainment of good fruits
 It happens
 jyotish ke anusaar shani kii sadhesati kii manyatayen teen prakaar se hoti hai, pehali lagan se duusari chandra lagan yaa raashi se or teesri surya lagan se, uttar bharat main chandra lagan se shani kii saade saati kii gananaa kaa vidhaan pracheen kaal se chalaa aa rahaa he
 According to this belief, when Shanidev travels through the moon sign, it is considered as Sadesati, its effect is experienced from thirty months before coming to the zodiac and till after thirty months
 sadhesati ke dauraan shani jataka ke piale kiye gayi karmon kaa hisaab usee prakaar se letaa he, jaise ek ghar ke naukar ko puri jimmedaari dene ke baad maalik kuch samay baad hisaab maangata he, or hisaab main bhul hone par yaa galti karne par jis prakaar se sajaa naukar ko di jaati he usee prakaar se sajaa shani dev bhi har praani ko dete hai
 And not only this, those who have done good deeds, then also give sardhati prizes to them, such as being made the head of a city or village or the city, etc
 Sanyasati's narrative of Shani is received by many people, like King Vikramaditya, Raja Nal, King Harishchandra, also harasses Saturn's saintly saintly Mahatmas, who begin to indulge in Joga along with Bhoga
 har manushya ko tees saal me ek baar sadhesati avashya aati he, yadi yah saade saati dhanu, min, makar, kumbh raashi me hoti he, to kam peedajanak hoti he, yadi yah sadhesati chauthe, chathe, aathven, or barahawein bhav main hogi, to jataka ko avashya dukhi karegi, or tino sukh shaareerik, maansik, or aarthik ko haran karegi
in sadhesatiyon main kabhi bhuulakar bhi "neelam" nahi dhaaran karnaa chaiye, yadi kiya gaya to vajaay laabh ke haani hone kii puri sambhaavna hoti he
 Do not forget any new work, new industry, even in a half-century, before doing any work, you must get information from a knowledgeable astrologer
 Even you should not forget to buy a vehicle in this time, otherwise that vehicle Instead of being a vehicle of happiness, it will become a vehicle of sorrows
 We have seen in our last twenty-five years experience that how many industrialists in Sadhesati were in bad condition, and those who were crorepatis, they were road Then it started moving in a pot
 In this way, it was also realized that whenever Saturn is moving in four, six, eight, twelve, then its original wealth will be destroyed, no matter how much should be done
 If the idea of this time has already been done, then money is saved
 yadi saavdhaanee nahi barti gai to maatr pachhtaawaa hi rah jaataa he
 Therefore, every person should do the chanting tenacity and the laws that we will tell before the beginning of Saturn of this time
 To avoid the wrath of Lord Ravi, Ravana tied him with his legs in his captivity and turned his head downwards
 It was kept so that the curve of Saturn would not fall on Ravana
 aaj bhi kai hindu jane anjaane ravan kii bhaanti pratikatmak taur pe shani praturup ko dukaanon yaa vaahanon main pairon se baandh kar ulta latakaate hai
 Although the mythological suggestion is to do devotion to Shree Hanuman, because Shani Dev gave a boon to Hanuman ji that Hanuman devotees would not have a curved vision of Shani
 shanidev paramakalyaan karta nyaayadhish or jeev kaa paramahitaishi grah maane jate hai
 Lord Parayana beings who perform austerities after birth, at the time of penance, become ignorant and become impure by being ignorant of Maya, that is, they are not able to complete austerity, to fulfill the austerities of those ascetics Inspires to meditate again
 dreshkan kundli me jab shani ko chandramaa dekhtaa he, yaa chandramaa shani ke dwaara dekha jaataa he, to ucch koti kaa sant bana detaa he
 And such a person is disgusted with family attachment and gives disinterest by making a great saint
 shani purv janm ke tap ko purna karne ke liye praani kii samast manovritiyon ko paramatma main lagane ke liye manushya ko ant rahit bhav dekar ucch stareey mahatma bana detaa he
 So that his penance is successful in the present birth, and he can enjoy the joy of ecstasy and get the good fortune of the Lord Darshan
 shani tap karne kii prerana detaa he
 And Saturn places his mind in the divine
 kaaran shani hi navagrahon main jataka ke gyaan chakshu kholta he
 In the Skanda Purana, there is an account in the Kashi section, that Chhaya Suta Sri Shani Dev asked his father Lord Surya Dev that, o father! i want to get a post that no one has received till date, o Father! My mandal is seven times bigger than you, i have seven times more power than you, no one can withstand my velocity, whether it is Dev, Asura, Demon, or Siddha seeker
 May the times remain high
 i want to get another boon, that i should have a direct vision of my deity Lord Krishna, and that i can be full of devotional knowledge and science
 Hearing this God of Lord Shiva Ury pleased and overwhelmed, and said, Son! i also want that you are seven times more powerful than me
 i cannot bear your influence, for this you have to meditate, go to Kashi to do penance, go there and go to Lord Shankar
 Tax, shani grah kii peeda se nivaaran ke liye paath, puja, stotra, mantra or gayatri aadi ko likh rahaa hoon, jo kaafii laabhakaari siddh honge
