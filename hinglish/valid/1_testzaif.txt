 naastikta · isai dharm · hindu dharm · islam · yahudee dharm · sikh dharm Criticism or critique is the literary mode of discussing an object / subject, keeping its goal in view, its merits and demerits and suitability
 hindi aalochana kii shuruyaat 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main bharatendu yug se hi maani jaati he
 'criticism' literally means 'to look well'
 'aalochana' shabd 'luch' dhaatu se bana he
 'luch' means 'to see'
 samiksha or samalochna shabdon kaa bhi yahi arth he
 'criticism' is treated as a synonym for the term 'criticism' in English
 sanskrit main prachlit 'tikaa-vyakhya' or 'kavy-siddhantanirupan' ke liye bhi aalochana shabd kaa prayog kar liya jaataa he kintu acharya ramachandra shukla kaa spasht mat he ki aadhunik aalochana, sanskrit ke kavy-siddhantanirupan se swatantra chiz he
 The task of criticism is to examine a literary work thoroughly and determine its form, population and economy
 doctor shyamsundar das ne aalochana kii paribhaasha in shabdon main di he: That is, the duty of criticism is a literary interpretation of a literary work
 sahityakar jivan or anbhuv ke jin tatwon ke sanshleshan se sahitya rachana karata he, aalochana unheen tatwon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Where literature is dominant in literature, there is an element of wisdom in criticism
 aalochana aitihaasik, saamaajik, raajnneetik paristhitiyon or shistayon kaa bhi akalan karti he or sahitya par unke padane vaale prabhaavon kii vivechna karti he
 Condemning or criticizing a work based on personal interest is not a religion of criticism
 kriti kii vyakhya or vishleshan ke liye aalochana main paddati or pranali kaa mahatva hota he
 While criticizing, the critic can avoid his personal rage, disinterest, disinterest, only when he follows the method, he can only do justice to literature by being objective
 is drushti se hindi main acharya ramachandra shukla ko sarvshereshth aalochak mana jaataa he
 The types of criticism develop according to the beliefs and practices that are accepted when criticizing
 saamanyat: samiksha ke chaar prakaaron ko sweekaar kiya gaya he:- Theories of literature are considered in theoretical criticism
 isamen pracheen shastreey kaavyagon - ras, alankaar aadi or sahitya kii aadhunik manyataon tathaa niyamon kii mukhya rup se vivchena kii jaati he
 In theoretical criticism the point of consideration is whether the criterion of literature is classical or historical
 maandand kaa shastreey rup, sthir or aparivartansheel hota he kintu mandandon ko aitihaasik shrenee maananaper unka swaroop parivartansheel or vikasaatmak hota he
 Both types of theoretical criticisms are available
 kintu ab usee saiddhanthik aalochana kaa mahatva adhik he jo sahitya ke tatwon or niyamon kii aitihaasik prakriya main vikasman maanati he
 When literature is decided on the basis of certain principles, it is called judgmental criticism
 ise ek prakaar kii naitik aalochana bhi mana jaataa he
 Its main nature is to pass judgment on literary works like a judge
 aisi aalochana praaia: hi siddhanth kaa yantric dhang se upyog karti he
 Therefore, the importance of decisive criticism decreases
 yadhyapi mulya yaa shreshth sahitya or nikrusht sahitya kaa bodh paidaa karnaa aalochana ke pradhan dharmon main se ek he lekin vah siddhanton ke yantric upyog se nahin sabhanv he
 In the 'hindi Sahitya Kosh', the subject of decisive criticism is told: is prakaar aalochana main nirnay vivaad kaa bindu utana nahin he jitna nirnay ke liye apanaaya gaya tarika
 Like, there is value judgment in Ramchandra Shukla's criticism, but his method is creative, not mechanical
 nirnayaatmak aalochana main mulya or tarika, donon kii main lacheelaapan nahin hota
 In this critique, the effect of poetry on critic Cayman makes him busy with the stylish designation
 isamen vayactik ruchi hi mukhya he
 Effective Criticism is not an object of shock

 is krishikarya main bhoomi ko kuch inchon kii gaharaai tak khodakar mitti koplat diya jaataa he, jisase neeche kii mitti upar aa jaati he or vaayu, paala, varsha or surya ke prakaash tathaa ushma aadi prakritik shaktiyon dwaara prabhavit hokar bhurabhuri ho jaati he
 Before plowing the whole new land, the land is cleaned by cutting trees and plants
 tatpashchaat kisi bhi baari yantra se jutai karte hai jisase mitti katati he or palat bhi jaati he
 Thus, plowing several times makes the soil cultivable to a certain depth
 aisi upjau mitti kii gaharaai saadhaarant: ek foot tak hoti he
 The land below it, called Garbatala, remains unfulfilled
 is garbhtal ko bhi gahari jutai karanevaale yantra se jotikar mitti ko upjau bana sakate hai
 If this umbilical cord is not plowed and the plow continues to work to a certain depth, then the upper surface of the umbilical cord located at that depth becomes extremely rigid
 is kathor tah ko angreji main plau pan kehete hai
 This hard fold proves to be extremely harmful for agriculture, as it does not penetrate the hard bottom after rain or irrigation causes more water in the field
 at: mitti main adhik samay tak jal bharaa rahata he or anek prakaar kii haniyaan utpann ho jaati hen
 To avoid those losses, it becomes extremely necessary to break that hard fold every year
 mitti ke kanon ke pariman par mitti kii banaavat or unke kram par mitti kaa vinyas nirbhar he
 By changing the texture and configuration by plowing, we can make the soil capable of producing the desired crop
 beej bone ke liye ucch koti kii mitti praapt karne ke nimitt sarvapratham mitti palatanevaale kisi baari hal kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 After that plowing is done with a light plow in which no lumps are left and the soil becomes brittle
 yadi bade-bade dhele hon to belan yaa pata kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jisase dhele foot jate hai
 The use of a tillage machine depends mainly on the nature of the soil and the condition of the season
 beej bone ke pehle antim jutai atyant saavdhaanee se kerani chahie, kyonki mitti main ardrata kaa sangrakshan isi antim jutai par nirbhar he or beej ke jamane kii safalataa isi ardrata par nirbhar he
 This humidity reaches the upper layers through the capillary tubes of the soil
 ye keshika naliyaan kanantarik chhidron se banati hai
 The smaller the holes, the thinner and narrower the capillary tubes, and the more water will rise up into the soil
 in chhidron or isliye keshika naliyon ke aakar kaa upyukt yaa anupyukt hona jutai par nirbhar he
 The plow cannot be called plowing the field
 hal chalaane ke atirikt gudayi, niraai, fawde se khodna, pata yaa belan chalaanaa ityadi kaary jutai me sammilit hai
 The main intention of all these activities is that the soil becomes brittle and soft and suitable conditions are presented in the soil for the successful life of the plant
 paudhon ke liye jal, vaayu, uchit taap, bhajya padaarth, hanikaarak vastuon kii anupasthiti tathaa jadon ke liye sahaayak aadhaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 All these things are achieved by traction and the success of the crop depends on the extent to which these suitable conditions can be preserved in the soil
 astu, karshan ke mukhya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai : There is a very close relationship between water, air and heat
 yadi mitti mitti main jal kii maatra adhik hogi to vaayu kii maatra kam ho jaaegi, tadnusaar taap kam ho jayega
 Conversely if the soil is more dry then the temperature will be higher
 ye teenon aavashyak dashaayen mitti kii jot par nirbhar hai
 If the holdings are good, then water, air and heat are also in the proper form in the soil
 yadi mitti main jal adhik yaa nune maatra main ho, to uttam jot praapt nahin ho sakati
 Due to excess water, the soil starts sticking and tillage of such soil is destroyed
 jab mitti sookhne lagati he tab ek aisi avasthaa aa jaati he ki yadi us samay jutai kii jaae to uttam jot praapt hoti he
 When the clay soil dries, it becomes loose in it, which is difficult to break
 jutai kai prakaar kii hoti he, jaise gahari jutai, chhichhli jutai, adhik samay tak jutai, greeshm ritu kii jutai, halaai yaa haraai kii jutai, madhya se baahar kii ore yaa kinare se madhya kii ore tathaa ek kinare se duusare kinare kii ore jutai
 Every type of tillage has some or the other characteristic
 gahari jutai se mitti adhik gaharaai tak upjau ho jaati he or yah gahari janevaali jadon ke liye atyant upyukt hoti he
 Shallow plowing is good for rootsy and less deep root plants
 adhik samay tak tathaa greeshm ritu kii jutai se mitti main prastut hanikaarak keede tathaa unke andey nasht ho jate hai
 The weeds also destroy the clusters and the soil's drainage or retention power is high
 yadi khet bahut bada he to use halaai yaa haraai niyam se kai bhaagon main baantkar jutai karte hai 
 If the field is not flat and the middle part is low, then the middle should be outward and if the middle is high sloping, then the vertical plowing from the bottom should start and end towards the height
 aisa karne se khet dhire-dhire samtal ho jaataa he tathaa mitti bhi bhalee prakaar jut jaati he
 But this work cannot be done with native solution
 iske liye mitti palatanevaala hal hona chahie
 It has wings to turn the soil
 yahi kaaran he ki deshi hal ko vastav main hal nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki hal kii paribhaasha he vah yantra jo mitti ko kaate or use khodakar palat de
 Soil is cut from native plow, but does not invert
 isko hal kii altiwaitor kahana uchit he
 There are some principles of tillage which are the duty of the farmer to follow in every case, rather than the above mentioned rules
 upyog se paley hal kaa bhalee bhanti nirikshan kar lenaa chahie
 No part of it should be loose
 jue main usko aavashyak oonchaai par lagaaen
 This height is dependent on the height of the bulls
 jutai karte samay hal kii muthia dridhtaapurvak pakadani chahie taaki hal sidhaa or aavashyak gaharaai tak jaae
 The litter should be cut straight and close, otherwise the uncultivated land is left between the wells
 deshi hal se jutai karne main antara avashya chhutata he, jisko samaapt karne ke liye kai baar khet jotna padataa he
 The soil of the field should not be too wet or dry

 It is about the love triangle of three friends portrayed by Hrithik Roshan, Rani Mukherjee and Kareena Kapoor
 raaj khanna, puja saahani or tina kapur bachapan ke dost hai
 While Raj has always been attracted to the lively and beautiful Tina, she is completely unaware of Pooja's love for her
 raaj ke pita ne apane parivaar ke saath ek nai naukari ke liye england jane kaa faisla kiya
 Before leaving, Raj promises Tina to text her via e-mail
 tina lokapriy ladki he or jald hi anya chizon main vyast ho jaati he
 So Pooja writes Raj in the name of Tina so that Tina can fulfill her promise
 raaj or puja main kai chijen samaan hai or unke i-mail unhen ek-duusare ke kareeb laate hai
 a decade later, Raj returns to India for a short vacation
 ab tak vah jis ladki ko likh rahaa tha usase pyaar karata he or maanata he ki vah use pehali najar main pahchaan saktaa he
 When the three finally meet, he ignores Pooja completely and falls in love with Tina
 tina prarambh main anishchit hoti he lekin vah bhi dhire-dhire usase aakarshith ho jaati he
 However during the two weeks of his vacation he notices that the actual Tina is completely different from the Tina in the e-mail
 vah puja ke saath dosti bhi shuru karata he or apane saamaanya dilchaspee se prabhavit hota he
 But without realizing that he is indeed what he loves
 vah landan laut aata he jahaan puja sanyog se saakshaatkaar ke liye aati he
 Raj attends a church where he often attends
 vahaan use puja milti he jo vahi geet gunaguna rahi hoti he jo use pasand hota he
 She realizes that Pooja is the one who was writing to her all those years
 kyonki usne us carch or geet ke bare main i-mail main jaankaree saajha kii thi
 They discover their love for each other and decide to marry
 bharat main waapas tina ke pita achaanak mar jate hai
 Which makes Tina alone an orphan in the world
 unki aakhri ichha yah thi ki tina raaj se shaadi karegi, jise unhone raaj ke pita ko vyakt kiya tha
 Knowing that Tina also loves Raj and that she is now single, Pooja refuses to marry Raj
 kyonki vah tina ke dil ko todna nahin chaahati
 Raj's parents also agree to the marriage
 vah log landan main viksit raaj or puja ke bich sambandhon se anjaan hai
 Raj insists on telling his parents the truth but Pooja stops him
 vah kasam khaataa he ki agar puja usee din kisi or se shaadi kare to vah keval tabhi tina se shaadi karegaa
 Rohan Varma is Raj's friend who has always been attracted towards worship
 puja jis din raaj or tina kii shaadi he usee din usase shaadi karne ko raji hoti he
 On the wedding day, Tina learns that Raj actually loves Pooja

 dusron ke kashton or sanvegon kaa anubhav karne or samajhane ko tadnubhuti yaa samanubhuti kehete hai
 Empathy is contrasted with empathy and contrasted with apathy
 asamanubhuti main koi vyakti logon ke ksht ko samajhane or mahasoos karne kii baat to dur vah unke vipareet hota he
 Empathy differs from indifference, while empathy is way ahead
 samanubhuti main do pahalu paye jate hai- ek, samanubhuti vaala vyakti vah mahasoos karata he, jo doosraa mahasoos karata he
 Second, a person with empathy can understand what the other feels
 pehle ghatak ko bhavatmak ghatak kehete hai jo sabhi praaniyon main hota he
 Whereas the cognitive component of empathy occurs only in humans
 dusron ke ksht yaa sanvegon ko duusare ke pariprekshya se samajhane kii yogyata keval manushya main hoti he
 According to social psychologists, the method of taking perspective from the sufferings or emotions of others is called empathy
 pariprekshya gran teen prakaar kaa hota he- One way that empathy occurs in a person's mind is by imagining what will be the result of an event on another person
 ise 'rahgeer kii samanubhuti', kehete hai
 When people who do not go through an earthquake, terrorist attack or drought disaster or tragedy come forward to help such people, it is called empathy based on the way of other imagined perspective
 kisi vyakti ke man main samanubhuti utpann hone kaa doosraa tarika yah hota he ki vah kalpana kare ki koi ghatana yadi uske saath hoti ho use kaisaa lagata
 This is the self-conceived perspective
 jaise baadh yaa tufaan kii ghatana ko dekhne ke baad use apane upar laga kar dekhnaa ki uskaa parinaam kya hoga, yah swa kalpana pariprekshya he
 The tendency to help in empathy, based on a self-conceived perspective, intensifies
 log adhik samanubhuti vyakt karte hai, jab ve usee prakaar kii aapadaa kaa saamana karte hai
 For example, people who have previously experienced hurricanes will be particularly responsive to individuals affected by the storm
 jinhone bhuskhalan evam baadh kaa saamana kiya hoga, ve un logon kii tulana main jinhone aisi vipadaa na jheli ho, jaise ve baadh peediton ke prati adhik pratikriya karenge
 Those who have experienced poverty tend to react more deeply to the poor person
 kisi vyakti ke man main samanubhuti paidaa hone kaa ek tarika phantasy bhi hoti he
 This empathy is for a fictitious character, fictitious person or animal
 titannic film dekhne ke dauraan ant main titannic jahaaj ke dub janaa or apni premika ke liye qurbaani dekhakar film ke anya paatro ke saath ronaa phantasy ke aadhaar par paidaa hui samanubhuti he

 In the Hindu tradition, the system is mainly associated with the Shakta sect, followed by the Shaivism, and to a lesser extent the Vaishnava tradition
 shaiva parampara main tantra granthon ke vaktaa saadharantayah shivaji hote hai
 The Vajrayana sect of Buddhism is famous for its systemic thoughts, rituals and literature
 tantra kaa shabdic udbhav is prakaar mana jaataa he - “tanoti trayeti tantra”
 Which means - stretching, expansion, dispersion, thus it is tantra
 hindu, buddha tathaa jain darshanon main tantra paramparaayen milti hai
 Tantra practice here refers to "deep or deep meditation"
 tantron ko vedon ke kaal ke baad kii rachana mana jaataa he jiskaa vikaas pratham sahasrabdi ke madhya ke aasapaas hua
 In the literary form, as the Puranas are considered to be philosophical and religious works of the medieval period, similarly the tantra contains ancient stories, stories etc
 apni vishaywastu kii drushti se ye dharm, darshan, sristirachana shaastra, pracheen vigyaan aadi ke inasachlopedia bhi kahe ja sakate hai
 European scholars have tried to mislead the system by calling it a 'deep cultivation' or 'communal ritual', keeping in mind its post-colonial goals
 vaise to tantra granthon kii sankhya hajaaron main he, kintu mukhya-mukhya tantra 64 kahe gayi hai
 The effect of the system is globally
 iskaa pramaan hindu, buddha, jain, tibeti aadi dharmon kii tantra-sadhana ke granth hai
 In India, Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan have been strongholds of the system since ancient times
 yah shaastra teen bhaagon main vibhakt he— aagam, yamal or mukhya tantra 
 According to Varahi Tantra, which describes creation, holocaust, worship of deities, cultivation of all works, prayers, shatkarma-means and four types of meditation, it is called Agam
 jisamen sristitatv, jyotish, nity krity, kram, sutara, varnbhed or yugdharm kaa varnan ho use yamal kehete hai
 And in which the institutions of creation, brawls, chanting, deities, yantra nirnaya, pilgrimage, ashram, dharma, kalpa, astrology institute, vrat-katha, defecation and ashouch, female-male-traits, rajdharma, dan-dharma, youth religion, behavior and The description of spiritual matters is called tantra
 is shaastra kaa siddhanth he ki kaliyug main vaidic mantron, japon or yagyon aadi kaa koi fal nahin hota 
 In this era, for the accomplishment of all kinds of work, only the mantras and remedies etc
 mentioned in Tantra Shastra help
 is shaastra ke siddhanth bahut gupt rakhe jate hai or isaki shiksha lene ke liye manushya ko pehle dikshit hona padana he 
 Nowadays, Tantra mantras and Kriyas are often used for Maran, Uchchatana, Vashikaran etc
 and also for the means of many types of siddhis etc
 yah shaastra pradhantah shakton kaa hi he or iske mantra praayah arthhin or ekaakshari hua karte hai 
 Such as - Hin, Klein, Shrin, Sthi, Shun, Crew etc
 tantrikon kaa panchmakaar— madh, maance, matsay, mudra or maithun — or chakrapuja prasiddh he 
 Tantriks worship all the gods, but their worship is different and independent
 chakrapuja tathaa anya anek pujaaon main tantric log madh, maance or matsay kaa bahut adhikta se vyavhaar karte hai or dhobin, tailin aadi striyon ko nangi karke unka pujan karte hai 
 Although the Atharvaveda Samhita describes and teaches Maran, Mohan, Uchhatana and Vashikaran etc
, the modern system has no connection with it
 kuch logon kaa vishwaas he ki kanishka ke samay main or uske uparant bharat main aadhunik tantra kaa prachaar hua he 
 Chinese travelers Fahian and Huanseang have not mentioned this scripture in their articles
 yadhyapi nishchit rup se yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki tantra kaa prachaar kab se hua par to bhi isamen andeh nahin ki yah isvi chauthi yaa paanchavin shatabdi se adhik purana nahin he 
 Tantra was propagated among the Buddhists looking for Hindus and many texts were made in it
 hindu tantric unhen 'upatantar' kehete hai 
 They are promoted in Tibet and China
 vaarahi tantra main yah bhi likhaa he ki jaimini, kapil, naarad, garg, pulasthya, bhrigu, shukr, brihaspati aadi rishiyon ne bhi kai upatantron kii rachana kii he 
 According to grammatology, the word 'tantra' is made of 'tant' metal which means 'expansion'
 shaiva siddhanth ke ‘kayik aagam’ main iskaa arth kiya gaya he, tanyate vistaryate gyanam anen, iti tantram 
 Tantra's negation is proved by the combination of 'tan' and 'trai', both of these metals
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki tantra apane samgr arth main gyaan kaa vistaar karne ke saath us par aacharan karne waalon kaa traan bhi karata he
 There is also a name of Tantra-shastra called 'agam Shastra'
 iske vishay main kaha gaya he- Vachaspati Mishra has written in the tattva-varshadi interpretation of the Yoga commentary, meaning the word 'agam', which means that the measures of Abhyudaya and Dishayarayas come to the intellect, it is called 'agam'
 shastron ke ek anya swaroop ko 'nigam' kaha jaataa he
 Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads etc
 come under the corporation
 isamen gyaan, karm or upasna aadi ke vishay main bataaya gaya he
 That is why the Vedas and scriptures are called Nigam
 us swaroop ko vyavhaar main utaarne vaale upayon kaa rup jo shaastra batalaata he, use 'aagam' kehete hai
 The practicality is main in a system or prophecy
 tantra, kriyaaon or anushthan par bal detaa he
 In Varahi Tantra, behavior is the main one among the seven characteristics of this scripture
 ye saat lakshan hai- The general meaning of the system is 'method' or 'remedy'
 vidhi yaa upaay koi siddhanth nahin he
 There can be differences of opinion about the principles
 vigrah or vivaad bhi ho sakate hai, lekin vidhi ke sambandh main koi matbhed nahin he
 To avoid drowning, one has to swim
 bijli chahie to koyale, pani kaa anu kaa roopaantaran karnaa hi padegaa
 To run, feet have to be raised
 parvat par chadhana he to oonchaai kii taraf kadam badhaaye bina koi chaara nahin he
 These verbs are called 'method'
 tantra athwa aagam main vyavhaar paksh hi mukhya he
 In the eyes of the system, the body is the dominant instrument
 uske bina chetana ke ucch shikharon tak pahunchaa hi nahin ja saktaa
 For this reason, the Tantra refers to the 'tran' of the soul through 'tan' or its own salvation
 yah arth ek seemaa tak hi sahi he
 In fact, there is a coordinated use of the subtlest levels of body, mind and body of mind in systemic meditation
 yah avashya satya he ki tantra sharir ko bhi utana hi mahatva detaa he jitna ki man, budghi or chit ko
 The rituals and methods of worship are different in all religions, but all are unanimous regarding the system
 sabhi dharmon kaa maananaa he maanav ke bheetar anant urja chhipi hui he, uskaa paanch-saat pratishat hissaa hi kaary main aata he, shesh bhaag bina upyog ke hi padaa rahata he
 All religions and sects accept this fact with one opinion and according to their own it also shows the path of that part
 un dharm-sampradaayon ke anuyaayi apni chhipi hui shaktiyon ko jagaane ke liye praayah ek samaan vidhiyaan hi kaam main laate hai
 They include chanting, meditation, concentration practice and intensive use of body energy
 yahi tantra kaa pratipaadya he
 According to the Tantrokta faith, God is worshiped through mantras
 vishay ko spasht karne ke liye tantra-shaastra bhale hi kahin siddhanth kii baat karte hon, anyathaa aagam-shastron kaa teen chauthai bhaag vidhiyon kaa hi upadesh karata he
 All the texts of the system are revealed under the dialogues of Shiva and Parvati
 devi parvati prashn karti hai or shiv unka uttar dete hue ek vidhi kaa upadesh karte hai
 Most of the questions are problem solving
 siddhanth ke sambandh main bhi koi prashn poocha gaya ho to bhi shiv uskaa uttar kuch shabdon main dene ke uparant vidhi kaa hi varnan karte hai
 According to the Agam Shastra 'to do' is to know, no other 'knowing' comes under the definition of knowledge
 jab tak kuch kiya nahin jaataa, sadhana main pravesh nahin hota, tab tak koi uttar yaa samaadhaan nahin he
 The contents of the systems can be broadly explained as follows- sankhya tathaa veydant ke advait vichaar donon kaa prabhaav tantra granthon main dikhalaayi padataa he
 Tantra mentions both Shiva and Advaita with nature
 parantu tantra darshan main ‘shakti’ par vishesh bal diya gaya he
 Three traditions of the system are considered - shaiva aagmon kii chaar vichaardhaarayen hai – Agams occupy a very important place in the Indian tradition
 pracheen mandiron, pratimaaon, bhawanon, evam dharmik-aadhyatmik vidhiyon kaa nirdhaaran inke dwaara hua he

 Shiva's base is power
 shakti ke dwaara hi bandhan evam moksh praapt hota he
 The major text is Shivasutra
 isamen shiv kii pratybhigna ke dwaara hi gyaan prapti ko kaha gaya he
 The world is the manifestation of Shiva and it is possible or created by the power of Shiva
 is darshan ko ‘trik’ darshan bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki yah – shiv, shakti tathaa jeev teenon ke astitv ko sweekaar karata he
 The important text of this philosophy is "vachanam", which means 'the dictation of Shiva'
 yah darshan parmparik tathaa shiv ko hi purnataya samast kaarak, sanhaarak, sarjak maanata he
 It also does not consider caste discrimination
 is darshan ke antargat guru parampara kaa vishesh mahatv he
 The main goal of Agam is over 'kriya', however the details of knowledge are also not less here
 'vaarahitantr' ke anusaar aagam in saat lakshanon se samavit hota he : sristi, sthiti, pralay, devtarchan, sarvasaadhan, purashcharan, shatkarm, saadhan tathaa dhyanyog
 According to the 'mahanirvana' system, beings in Kali Yuga are often inferior to the thoughts of Medhy and Amdhya and for their welfare, Lord Maheshwar himself preached Agamas to Parvati himself
 shaiva aagam dwait, shaktivishishtadvait tathaa advait kii drushti se bhi inamen teen bhed maane jate hai
 Agamic worship is pure and pure Indian
 28 shaivagam siddhant ke rup main vikhyath hai

 In the Kiranagam, it is written that, at the end of the universe, God first manifested ten Shaivas to transmit the Maha Gyan and gave each of them a fraction of their undivided Maha Gyan
 is avibhakt mahagyaan ko hi shaivagam kaha jaataa he
 Just as the Veda is truly one and is a form of monolithic mahagyana, but has been divided and appeared in three or four forms, in the same way, the original Shivagam has also become famous as 28 Agamas, despite actually being one
 in samast aagmdhaaraon main prayek kii parampara he
 Two ideologies of the Vaishnava Samhita are found - Vaikhanas Samhita, and Pancharatra Samhita
 vaikhanas samhita – yah vaishnav parampara ke vaikhanas vichaardhaara he
 The Vaikhanas tradition is primarily austerity and instrumental tradition
 pancharaatr samhita – pancharaatr se abhipraay he – ‘panchanishaao kaa tantra’
 The Pancharatra tradition primarily encompasses the evolution of the world, creation, etc
 isamen sankhya tathaa yoga darshanon kii manyataon kaa samavesh dikhaayi detaa he
 The Pancharatra tradition has been more popular than the Vaikhanas tradition
 iske 108 granthon ke hone ko kaha gaya he
 In addition to the ideology of devotion in the Vaishnava tradition, the principle of power is also included

 a computer program is that instruction or a set of several instructions that are used to perform a task at a given time with a Prayong computer
 ise software program yaa keval program yaa phir strot code bhi kehete hai
 The program is used to process any information in the microprocessor
 taaki procesar upayokta kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar kaary karasake
 It is built in program language such as c ++ etc
 jis prakaar se kisi bhashaa kaa prayog karke kisi anya vyakti ko kisi tarah kaa nirdesh diya ja saktaa he usee tarah kaarykram bhashaa kaa prayog karke abhiklitr ko kisi tarah ke kaary karne kaa nirdesh diya ja saktaa he
 All program languages have a fixed format, according to which the source signal is created
 is praaroop main kisi bhi prakaar kaa parivartan karne par vah strot sanket nishchit parinaam nahin de saktaa he
 Classification of program languages is mainly done in two groups - 1 low level language and 2
 high level language
 is samooh main un kaarykram bhashaaon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he, jo procesar tak nideshon ko preshit karne ke liye yaa to kisi bhi anuvadak kaa prayog nahin karti hai yaa phir keval assembler kaa prayog karti hai
 Code written in lower level languages is perfectly suitable to be implemented in the original form
 saath hi saath kam se kam smriti grahan karata he or kriyanvayan main nunatam samay letaa he
 Their implementation is as simple as that
 inhen prayog karnaa utana hi kathin he kyonki nimna stareey bhashaaon kaa prayog karne vaale ke liye abhiklitr upkarnon se sambandhit kaaryon main purnatah daksh hona aavashyak he
 At the same time, it takes longer to produce the source signal in this language
 isliye nim stareey bhashaayen chote kaarykram ke liye to upyukt ho sakati hai, parantu bade kaarykram kaa nirmaan karne ke liye inkaa prayog karnaa atyant kathin hota he
 The following level languages are divided into two classes: machine level languages and assembly languages
 abhiklitr kaarykram banane kii prakriya kai charnon main sampann hoti he
 Electricity has been in use for a long time and as a result of continuous investigation, many types of electrical devices are being used in today's era
 kisi chaalak main vidyut dhara bahane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki chaalak ke donon siron ke bich kuch vibhavantar ho jise volt main mapa jaataa he
 The unit of measurement of electric current is ampere
 jab yah dhara kisi chaalak main pravaahit hoti he, to do prakaar ke prabhaav dikhaai padate hai : All these effects of current are used variously in current measuring methods
 iske atirikt, yadi kisi chaalak ke paas chumbakeey kshetra main parivartan ho yaa do prakaar ke chaalkon ke sangam ko garam kiya jaae yaa kuch rasinic kriya ho, tab vidyudvahak bal utpann hota he
 Many instruments depend on these principles
 yadi kinhin do chaalak pindon ke bich vibhavantar ho to unke bich aakarshan hota he
 The difference can also be measured by measuring this attraction
 yadi vidyunmay kan yaa electron nirvaat main prakshepit ho to vidyutiya yaa chumbakeey kshetra ke prabhaav se unne path ko modaa ja saktaa he
 a particular class of electrical equipment has resistance measuring tips
 kisi chaalak ke siron ke vibhavantar ko uske pratirodh se, jo om main maapi jaati he bhaag diya jaae to chaalak se pravaahit dhara kaa maan ampiore main gyaat ho jaataa he
 This is called Ohm's law
 kisi bhi paripath main kisi samay jitani vidyut shakti vyay ho rahi he uskaa maan wat main mapa jaataa he or vah is samay ke vibhavantar or dhara ke gunanfal ke baraabar hoti he
 The electric power is measured by a wattometer
 saadharantaya urja kilowat ghanta yaa board ov trade ikai main maapi jaati he
 When measuring power in kilowatts and time in hours, the power value is equal to their product
 yah urjamapi se mapa jaataa he
 If the differential of the electric current is fixed, then it would be sufficient to measure the product of the current and the time and which the power meter can show
 yadi kisi paripath main dhara badalati rahati ho or yah vishesh rup se ucch aavriti kii ho, to prerakatv tathaa vidyudharita do anya gunon hai jinhen jaananaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The value of inductance is equal to the magnetic conductance that surrounds the conductor
 vidyucchumbakeey niyam ke anusaar jab kabhi yah dhara ghatati, yaa badhati he, tab chaalak me ek vidyutvahak bal utpann hota he, jo is parivartan ko rokna chahta he
 The unit of persuasion is Henry, named after physics expert Joseph Henry
 yadi kisi chaalak main dhara kaa maan ek ampiore prati second bade or usamen isse ek volt kaa vibhavantar utnann ho jaae to is chaalak kaa praren ek henry hota he
 The effect of electromagnetism is just the opposite, because the alternating current cannot flow through the facility and the direct current cannot flow
 dharita kii samanta ek lacheelee kamaani se kii ja sakati he, jo sthir bal ke kaaran thodaa badhkar ruk jaati he, parantu parivartansheel bal ke prabhaav main dolit hoti rahati he
 Electrification mainly has three effects - magnetic effect, thermal effect, and chemical effect
 in teenon main se kisi bhi prabhaav ko vidyuddhara kii upasthiti or uskaa maan gyaat karne ke liye kaam main laa sakate hai, parantu yatharthata or saralata ke kaaran praaia: sarvatra chumbakeey prabhaav hi kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 There are two types of dielectric: dekhen : dharamapi The tangent brometer is the most simple and useful movable magnetometer
 isamen kisi achumbakeey padaarth ke urdhwadhar dhaanche par vidyutarodhi taanbe ke taar kii ek vrittakar kundali lagi rahati he
 The horoscope usually consists of 552 rounds, with connective screws after 2, 50 and 500 rounds
 inaki sahaayta se aavashyatanusaar kam yaa adhik chakkaron se kaam le sakate hai
 The circular coil can be rotated around the vertical axis
 kundali ke centre par ek chumbakeey sui urdhwadhar kilak par sadhi rahati he or sui ke lamberup ek aluminium kaa lanbaa sanketak laga rahata he, jo sooyee ke saath saath kshaitij vrittakar scale par ghumta he or chumbakeey sooyee kaa vikshep batalaata he
 The scale is divided into four quadrants and each quartile has signs ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees
 jab chumbakeey sooyee chumbakeey yamyottar main hoti he, to sanketak shunya ansh par rahata he
 When electric current flows in a coil placed in a magnetic field, a coaxial force acts on the coil, which it begins to rotate
 is siddhant ko kaam main laakar jo dharamapi banaae gaye, hai unhen chalkundal dharamapi kehete hai
 It consists of a rectangular coil with thin and electrified copper wire
 yah kundali phasphar branj kii bahut patali pattee dwaara ek pench se lataki rahati he, kundali kaa ek sira isi pattee se judaa rahata he or pattee kaa sambandh dharamapi ke e sanyojak pench se hota he
 The leaf also has a circular plane or concave mirror, which rotates along the leaf
 kundali kaa doosraa sira dhaatu kii ek sarpil kamaani se judaa rahata he, jiskaa sambandh duusare sanyojak pench se hota he
 This coil hangs between the poles of a powerful permanent umbilical magnet
 chumbak ke dhruv natodar belanaakaar akruti main kate rahete hai
 a soft iron small cylinder is enclosed in the back of the Dharmapi by a screw inside the coil between the two pole segments
 ye sab vastuen ek achumbakeey baks main band rakhi jaati hai
 Glass is placed in the front of the box, so that the mirror can be measured by deflection lamp and scale method
 jab kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab kundali ke do bhujaaon par balyugma kaary karata he or kundali ko uski sthiravastha se ghuma detaa he, jisase phosphor branj kii pattee or neeche kii sarpil kamaani main anthan aa jaati he or e anthan bal yugma kundali par vipareet disha main kaary karne lagata he
 Due to which the horoscope is soon in balance
 dekhen - ameter # chal loh ameter This type of thermometer depends on the thermal effect of the current
 jab dhara kisi chaalak se pravaahit hoti he, tab vah chaalak tapt ho jaataa he
 The value of the generated heat is proportional to 2 x
 yadi dhara ampiore main or pratirodh om main ho, to The value of heat is proportional to the square of the current, that is, it is not dependent on the direction of current
 isliye aise dharamapi disht athwa prayavarti dhara donon hi ke naapane ke prayog main laae ja sakate hai
 See, dynamometer yah yantra vishesh rup se ucch-aavritiwali bahut ksheen or kshanik prayavarti dhara ko naapane ke prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 It usually consists of a silver-plated crystal coil, a powerful electromagnet
 donon dhruv khandon main gol chhidr bane rahete hai, jinase ek samaantar prakaash kiranwali ek ore se duusari ore nikalati he
 One is the light source and lens towards the pole section and the other towards the pole section is either remote or film camera
 prakaash kiranavali dwaara doordarshee kii netrika yaa camera ke film par tane hue taar kii chaaya padati he
 When any weak and transient current flows through this wire, according to Fleming's law, a force acts on the wire, whose direction is perpendicular to both the current and the magnetic field
 is bal ke kaaran taar apni jagah se hatati he or chaaya bhi hatati he
 When a record of a transient or alternating current is to be taken, the camera film is moved by a meter and the current is flown into the wire
 photo ke film par dhara kaa abhilekh ban jaataa he
 When a weak direct current is measured, then the micrometer is installed in place of the camera
 disht dhara jab taar se pravaahit hoti he, tab taar kii chaaya ek ore hat jaati he
 The micrometers measure the displacement of the shadow from the ophthalmic membrane, resulting in the value of the current
 yah atyant sugrahi or upyogi dharamapi he
 It is mostly used to sense the alternating voltage, or wave form of the current
 vastut: yah ek mritspand dharamapi he, jisaki prakritik dolan aavriti bahut adhik hoti he or jiske chalanshil bhaagon kaa jadtv bahut kam hota he
 a direct current measuring ammeter is mostly a magnetometer thermometer, parallel to which a flux wire is connected
 parshvavahi ek alp pratirohak hota he, is kaaran is yantra kaa pratirodh bahut kam hota he or jab yah kisi paripath main shreneekram main joda jaataa he, tab dharaman ko kinchit bhi nahin badalata
 Most of the current in the circuit flows through the inflow and some of it from the horoscope
 kundali aluminium ke dhaanche par bandhi rahati he or dhaanchaa kilak par is prakaar aropit rahata he ki kundali sugamawa se shaktishaalee chumbak ke dhruvakhandon ke bich ghum sake
 a voltmeter measuring direct voltage is usually a magnetometer capacitor, keeping a high resistor graded
