 The five Pandavas received Draupadi as a wife in the panchal-state, when Arjuna's goal-breaking skills led to fisheries
 draupadi panch-kanyaon main se ek hai jinhen chir-kumari kaha jaataa he
 When the education of the Pandava and Kaurava princes was complete, they wanted to give Guru Dakshina to Dronacharya
 dronacharya ko drupad ke dwaara kiye gayi apane apmaan kaa samaran ho aayaa or unhone rajkumaron se kaha, “rajkumaron! yadi tum gurudakshina dena hi chaahate ho to paanchal naresh drupad ko bandi bana kar mere samaksh prastut karo
 This will be your Gurudakshina
 ” gurudev ke is prakaar kehane par samast rajkumaar apane-apane astr-shastr le kar paanchal desh kii ore chale
 On reaching Panchal, Arjun said to Dronacharya, “gurudev! You first allow the Kauravas to fight with King Drupada
 yadi ve drupad ko bandi banane main asafal rahe to ham pandav yuddh karenge
 On receiving the Guru's orders, the Kauravas led by Duryodhana attacked Panchal
 donon pakshon ke madhya bhayankar yuddh hone laga kintu ant main kaurav parrast ho kar bhaag nikle
 Seeing the Kauravas fleeing, the Pandavas started the attack
 bhimsen tathaa arjuna ke parakram ke samaksh paanchal naresh kii sena haar gai
 Arjuna went ahead and made Drupada a prisoner and brought it to Guru Dronacharya
 drupad ko bandi ke rup main dekh kar dronacharya ne kaha, “he drupad! ab tumhaare rajya kaa swami main ho gaya hoon
 i came to you as a friend, but you did not accept me as your friend
 ab bataao kya tum meri mitrataa sweekaar karte ho?” drupad ne lajja se sir jhukaa liya or apni bhul ke liye kshamayachna karte huye bole, “he dron! aapako apana mitra na maananaa meri bhul thi or uske liye ab mere hriday main pashchaatap he
 Both i and my kingdom are now subject to you, now do whatever you wish
 ” dronacharya ne kaha, “tumne kaha tha ki mitrataa samaan varg ke logon main hoti he
 Therefore, i am returning half of your kingdom to you in order to maintain a friendly spirit with you
 ” itnaa kah kar dronacharya ne ganga nadi ke dakshini tat kaa rajya drupad ko saunp diya or shesh ko swayan rakh liya
 Over time, Parmas studied many other disciplines

 samay aane par dhritarashtra ne yudhisthir ko yuvaraj ke pad par asin kar diya tha
 After being defeated by Guru Drona, Maharaj Drupada was extremely ashamed and started thinking of a way to let him down in some way
 isi chintaa main ek baar ve ghoomte huye kalyani nagari ke brahmanon kii basti main ja pahunche
 There he met the great Karmakandi Brahmin brothers named Yaz and Upayaj
 raja drupad ne unki seva karke unhen prasann kar liya evam unase dronacharya ke maarane kaa upaay poocha
 On his asking, elder brother Yaj said, "for this you please Agnidev by organizing a huge yajna so that he will give you the gift of that great powerful son
 " maharaj ne yaaj or upyaaj se unke kahe anusaar yajna karavaaya
 Pleased with his sacrifice, Agnidev gave him a son who was full of weapons and armor
 uske pashchaat us yajna kund se ek kanya utpann hui jiske netra khile huye camel ke samaan dedeepyaman the, bhauhen chandramaa ke samaan vakr thim tathaa uskaa varna shyaamal tha
 As soon as she was born, there was an All India Radio that this girl was born for the destruction of the Kshatriyas and the destruction of the Kauravas
 balak kaa naam dhridhyumna evam balika kaa naam krishna rakhaa gaya
 When the Pandavas had spent some time living in the city of Ekchakra, one day a Brahmin came to visit them
 pandavon ne uskaa yathochit satkar karke poocha, “dev! aapkaa aagaman kahan se ho rahaa he?” brahman ne uttar diya, “main maharaj drupad kii nagari paanchal se aa rahaa hoon
 There, the king-maharaja of many countries have come for the Swayamvara of Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada
 ” pandavon ne prashn kiya, “he brahmanottam! draupadi main kya-kya gun tathaa visheshtaayen hai?” is par brahman bolaa, “pandavagan! guru dron se parajeet hone ke uparant maharaj drupad atyant lajjit huye or unhen kisi prakaar se nicha dikhaane kaa upaay sochane lage
 In this concern, once he wandered and reached the colony of Brahmins of Kalyani city
 vahaan unki bhent yaaj tathaa upyaaj naamak mahaan karmkandi brahman bhaaiyon se hui
 King Drupada pleased him by serving him and asked him the solution to kill Dronacharya
 unke poochne par bade bhai yaaj ne kaha, “iske liye aap ek vishaal yajna kaa aayojan karke agnidev ko prasann kijiye jisase ki ve aapako ve mahaan balashaali putr kaa vardaan de denge
 Maharaj performed the yajna and the yajya as per his instructions
 unke yajna se prasann ho kar agnidev ne unhen ek aisa putr diya jo sampoorn aayudh evam kavach kundal se yukt tha
 After that a girl was born from that sacrificial fire, whose eyes were bright like a lotus in bloom, eyebrows were like the moon and her character was bright
 uske utpann hote hi ek akashwani hui ki is balika kaa janm kshatriyon ke sanhaar or kauravon ke vinaash ke hetu hua he
 The child was named Dhritashyumna and the girl was named Krishna
 drupad ne dhridhyumna ko shiksha ke liye dronacharya ke paas bhej diya or dronacharya apni samast shatruta ko tyaag kar us balak ko vidya pradaan karne lage
 The girl has become very lavanayamayi by becoming young and is about to become a swayamvar
 us brahman ke prasthaan karne ke pashchaat pandavon se bhent karne vedavyas ji aa pahunche
 Ved Vyas ordered the Pandavas to go to Panchal
 vahaan drupad kanya panchali kaa swayamvar hone ja rahaa he
 That girl is worthy of you all because she had done penance to Lord Shankar in her previous life and being pleased with her penance, Shiva ji gave her the boon of getting five excellent husbands in the next life
 vah deviswaroopa balika sab bhanti se tum logon ke yogya hi he
 You guys go there and get it
 itnaa kah kar veda vyas vahaan se chale gayi
 While traveling to Panchal country, the Pandavas reached the Shrayana shrine at night
 vahaan par gandharvaraj chitrarath apni striyon ke saath vihaar kar rahe the
 Seeing the Pandavas coming, Chitraratha said from afar, “be careful! At this time, entry of anyone is prohibited here, because at night, water is completely occupied by Gandharvas
 tum log praatavkaal hone ke pashchaat hi yahan pravesh kar sakate ho
 Hearing the words of Chitraratha, Arjun became angry and said, "oh fool! Nobody has any right over river, mountain, sea
 phir ganga to sabaki mata he, in par to kisi kaa adhikaar ho hi nahin saktaa
 On the saying of Arjuna, Chitraratha started showering poisonous arrows at Arjuna
 un vifaille baanon kaa jawaab arjuna ne aagney baanon se diya or chitrarath unke baanon ke lagane par ghayal hokar bhoomi main gir pade
 Arjun immediately grabbed her hair and dragged her to Yudhishthira
 chitrarath kii durdasha dekh kar kumbhaanasi naamak uski patni vilaap karti hui yudhisthir ke paas pahaunchi or apane pati ke praanon kii bhiksha maangane lagi
 Ashamed of the woman's prayer, Yudhishthira freed Chitraratha with a pardon
 kantiheen chitrarath ne pandavon se kshamayachna karte huye kaha, “main aap logon ke bal-paurush se atyant prabhavit hua hoon tathaa apni bhul sweekaar karata hoon
 If you guys agree, i want to be friends with you
 ” pandavon ne uski mitrataa sweekaar kar lee
 On becoming friends, Chitraratha taught the Pandavas the use of occultism so that they could see subtle things from subtle but they could not be seen by anyone
 iske badale main arjuna ne gandharvaraj chitrarath ko aagneyastra kaa prayog sikhaaya
 After this Chitraratha went to Gandharvalok and the Pandavas left for Panchal
 maarg main pandavon kii bhent dhaumy naamak brahman se hui or ve uske saath brahmanon kaa vesh dhar kar drupadi ke swayamvar main pahunche
 In the Swayamvara Sabha, kings and emperors of many countries were present
 ek ore shri krishna apane bade bhai balram tathaa ganmaanya yaduwanshiyon ke saath virajman the
 There they sat in the row of Brahmins
 kuch hi der main rajkumaari draupadi haath main varmala liye apane bhai dhridhyumna ke saath us sabha main pahaunchin
 Addressing the gathering, Dhrishtadyum said, "O kings and emperors and other dignitaries from different countries! Notice the rotating machine built above the pillar made in this pavilion
 us yantra main ek machhlee lataki hui he tathaa yantra ke saath gum rahi he
 You have to target the eye of the fish by moving the arrow while looking at the image of the fish in the oilplate placed under the column
 machhlee kii aankh main safal nishaanaa lagane vaale se meri bahan draupadi kaa vivaah hoga
 " ek ke baad ek sabhi raja-maharaja evam rajkumaron ne machhlee par nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi or ve kantiheen hokar apane sthaan main laut aaye
 Kauravas like Jarasangha, Shalya, Shishupala and Duryodhana Dushashasan were also included in these unsuccessful people
 kauravon ke asafal hone par duryodhana ke param mitra karn ne machhlee ko nishaanaa banane ke liye dhanush uthaaya kintu unhen dekh kar draupadi bol uthin, “yah sutaputra he isaliye main iskaa varan nahin kar sakati
 Hearing Draupadi's words, Karna felt ashamed and put a bow arrow
 uske pashchaat brahmanon kii pankti se uth kar arjuna ne nishaanaa lagane ke liye dhanush uthaa liya
 Seeing a Brahmin eager for the princess's swayamvara, the people present there were very surprised, but no one could stop them because the Brahmins were superior to the Kshatriyas
 arjuna ne tailpaatr main machhlee ke pratibimb ko dekhte huye ek hi baan se machhlee kii aankh ko bhed diya
 Draupadi went ahead and put varmala on Arjun's neck
 ek brahman ke gale main draupadi ko varmala daalate dekh samast kshatriya raja-maharaja evam rajkumaron ne krodhit ho kar arjuna par akraman kar diya
 The remaining Pandavas also came to Arjuna's help and a fierce battle ensued between the Pandavas and the Kshatriya kings
 shri krishna ne arjuna ko pehle hi pahchaan liya tha, isaliye unhone bich bachaav karke yuddh ko shant kara diya
 Duryodhana also guessed that the target Arjun must have been the one and the remaining Pandavas who supported him
 varanavat ke laakshagrih se pandavon ke batch nikalne par use atyant aashcharya hone laga
 The Pandavas took Draupadi along and reached there where they were staying with their mother Kunti
 dwaar se hi arjuna ne pukaar kar apni mata se kaha, “maate! aaj ham log aapke liye ek adbhut bhiksha le kar aaye hai
 "kunti said from within," sons! You people consume it together
 ” baad main yah gyaat hone par ki bhiksha vadhoo ke rup main hai, kunti ko atyant pashchaatap hua kintu mata ke vachanon ko satya siddh karne ke liye draupadi ne paanchon pandavon ko pati ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 After some time after the Pandavas took Draupadi to their residence, Krishna followed them there
 krishna ne apni buaa kunti ke charansparsh kar ke aashirwad praapt kiya or sabhi pandavon se gale mili
 After the formalities were completed, Yudhishthira asked Krishna, “O Dwarikadhish! How did you recognize us in our unknown? " Krishna replied, "how could i not recognize you after seeing the might of Bhima and Arjuna
 ” sabhi se bhent mulaakaat karke krishna vahaan se apni nagari dwarika chale gayi
 Then the five brothers collected food items from the begging and brought it to the mother Kunti
 kunti ne draupadi se kaha, “devi! is bhiksha se pehle devataaon ke ansh nikaalo
 Then give alms to the Brahmins
 tatpashchaat ashriton kaa ansh alag karo
 After that serve half of the remaining portion to Bhima and the remaining half to all of us for food
 ” pativrata draupadi ne kunti ke aadesh kaa paalan kiya
 After eating, he slept after laying antelope on misrule
 draupadi mata ke pairon kii ore soi
 At the time of Draupadi's swayamvar, Duryodhana, as well as Drupada, Dhritadyumna and many others had suspected that they were Brahmin Pandavas
 unki pariksha karne ke liye drupad ne dhridhyumna ko bhej kar unhen apane rajaprasaad main bulavaa liya
 In Rajprasad, Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna showed the first treasury but the Pandavas did not show any interest in Ratnabhushans and ratna-manikya etc
 kept there
 kintu jab ve shastraagaar main gayi to vahaan rakhe astr-shastron un sabhi ne bahut adhik ruchi pradarshit kiya or apni pasand ke shastron ko apane paas rakh liya
 His activity convinced Drupada that he was a warrior as a Brahmin
 drupad ne yudhisthir se poocha, “he arya! aapke parakram ko dekh kar mujhe vishwaas ho gaya he ki aap log brahman nahin hai
 Please introduce yourself properly
 ” unke vachanon ko sun kar yudhisthir ne kaha, “rajan! aapkaa kathan aksharshah satya he
 We are pandu-putra Pandavas
 main yudhisthir hoon or ye mere bhai bhimsen, arjuna, nakul evam sahadev hai
 Our mother Kunti is in your palace with your daughter Draupadi
 ” Listening to Yudhishthira, Drupada was very happy and said, "today God listened to me
 main chahta tha ki meri putree kaa vivaah pandu ke parakramee putr arjuna ke saath hi ho
 Today, i arrange the formal marriage of Arjun and Draupadi
 ” is par yudhisthir ne kaha, “rajan! draupadi kaa vivaah to ham paanchon bhaaiyon ke saath hona he
 On hearing this, Drupada was surprised and said, "how is this possible? a man may have many wives, but a woman has five husbands that has never been seen or heard of
 ” yudhisthir ne kaha, “rajan! na to main kabhi mithyaa bhaashan karata hoon or na hi koi kaary dharm yaa shaastra ke viruddh karata hoon
 Our mother has ordered all our brothers to consume Draupadi and i can never disobey the mother's orders
 ” isi samay vahaan par vedavyas ji padhaare or unhone drupad ko draupadi ke purv janm main tapasya se prasann ho kar shankar bhagwaan ke dwaara paanch parakramee pati praapt karne ke var dene kii baat bataai
 After listening to the words of Ved Vyas ji, the suspicion of Drupada came to an end and he performed his daughter Draupadi's palanquin ritual with great pomp with the five Pandavas
 is vivaah main vishesh baat yah hui ki devarshi naarad ne swayan padhaar kar draupadi ko pratidin kanyaroop ho jane kaa aashirwad diya
 The talk of the Pandavas being alive and getting married to Draupadi quickly spread everywhere
 hastinapur main is samachar ke milane par duryodhana or uske sahyogiyon ke dukh kaa parawar na rahaa
 They did not want to return the Pandavas to their kingdom but due to Bhishma, Vidur, Drona etc
 convincing Dhritarashtra and pressurizing them, they were forced to give half of the kingdom to the Pandavas

 Any consecutive three Fibonacci numbers, taking two at a time, have been proportional prime numbers: ie, or saamanytah, The divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by the prime p is related to the Legendre sign { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} which is assumed to be as follows: agar p ek abhajya sankhya he, to f p ≡ and f p − ≡ 0 
 { \ displaystyle F_{p} \ equiv \ left{ \ pmod {p}} \ ; \ ;{ \ mbox{ and }} \ ; \ ; \ ;f_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p}}

+F12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144= 374 = 11×34 In fact, the identities are not only positive, but are true for all n integers: n = 0: F0 + F1 + 


 + F9 = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 = 88 = 11 × 8n = −1: F−1+F0+

 Because this ratio is irrational, there is no one else at the same angle from the center, side of a floret, so the florets are efficiently filled together
 Because the formula for the rational approximation of the golden ratio is F: F, the index in the nearest neighborhood of the floral number n is at n ± f for j based on the distance r from the center

 About 600 years before Christ, Thalis, a resident of Greece, was aware that some objects attract light objects after rubbing
 iskaa ullekh thiafrastus ne 321 i
pus

 This attraction power was studied by William Gilbert in the 16th century and he called it 'electric'
 aadhunik shabd 'electron' kaa upyeg unani bhashaa main ambar ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term 'electricity' was used in 1650 by Walter Charlton
 isi samay rabart byal ne pataa lagaaya ki aaweshit vastuen halki vastuon ko shunya main bhi aakarshith karti hai, arthant vidyut ke prabhaav ke liye hawa kaa madhyam hona aavashyak nahin he
 In 1729, Stephen Gray stated that this attraction power can be transmitted from one part of an object to another
 aisi vastuon ko desagulirs ne 'chaalak' kaha
 All types of metals fall into this category
 ve vastuen jinamein is shakti ko sanchaarit nahin kiya ja saktaa, vidyutarodhi kehalaati hai
 There are amber, wax, dry air, dry glass, rubber, lacquer etc
 in this category

 Previously, the names Kachabha and Regini were in use respectively
 san 1737 main duphe ne bataaya ki sajaateey aavesh ek duusare ko pratikarshith karte hai tathaa vijaateey aakarshith karte hai
 In 1745, Clyst in Cummin, Massenbrook in Lyden, and William Watson in London said that electricity can also be stored, their experiments and ideas gave rise to the famous accumulator Leiden Jar
 lagbhag isi samay vidyut ko paryaapt maatra main praapt karne ke praytn bhi jari the tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke vidyut yantron kaa avishkaar hua
 Willie Watson thought that electricity is a type of elastic fluid that exists in every object

 Franklin said that electricity can neither be generated nor destroyed
 franklin ne liden jaar kaa adhyayan kar uski kriya ko samajhane kii cheshtaa kii
 But Franklin's most famous and important experiment was that, in which he proved that the properties of electricity and ordinary electricity are similar at the time of cloud to cloud
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vidyut ke kan ek duusare par bal daalate hai
 After Franklin, Epinus took these ideas and gave the impression that the force of two objects decreases by increasing the distance between them
 is siddhant kaa vistaar jajef pristli tathaa henry cavendish ne kiya
 Coulom then discovered that the force between two charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and the product of the charge
 vidyut kaa yah mul niyam ab bhi 'kulom kaa balanium' kaha jaataa he
 In 1837, Michael Faraday studied the effect of the medium on the electric force between any two charged objects and found that if the medium is any more insulated in place of air then the electric force decreases, this property of anti-electromagnetism
 Said to be 'uniquely eclectic
' unhone apane barf ke baratanwale prasiddh prayog dwaara darshaya ki yadi kisi aaweshit chaalak kaa ek baratan main laayaa jaae, to baratan ke andar kii ore vijaateey aavesh prerit hota he tathaa baahar kii ore sajaateey awesh
 Faraday made an in-depth study of the electrodynamics and introduced the idea of electric force lines to explain their various effects and called the empty space between charged objects a 'zone'

 In the last years of the eighteenth century, many experiments and theories regarding the movement of charges were coming to light
 san 1780 main italy ke ljugi gailawani ne mechak ke upar vidyut pravaah ke kai prayog kiye
 In 1800, Volta found electrical effects in two dissimilar metals soaked with dilute acid or salt solution and obtained electric current from them
 is vidyut pravaah ko kai guna karne ke liye unhone aisi kai asmaan dhaatuon ke jodon ko lekar ek punj banaaya jise voltiy punj kehete hai
 According to these experiments by Volta, a 'voltaic Cell' was created to achieve electrification
 usee varsh england main niklson tathaa karlile ne is baat kaa pataa lagaaya ki yadi pani main vidyut dhara pravaahit kii jaae to pani ke hydrogen tathaa oxigen main apghaton ko jaataa he
 Such decomposition is called electrical decomposition
 crukashaik ne pataa lagaaya ki vilyan ke dhaatulavan bhi isi prakaar apaghatit kiye ja sakate hai
 After this Faraday regularly studied this action and established 'faraday's rules'

 In 1820 Hans Christian Arstad discovered that a current with a current in a wire also has a magnetic field related to it
 is mahatvapurn khoj ko kipro tathaa sawar ne or ampiore ne ganit evam prayogon kii sahaayta se aage badhaayaa
 Ampere showed that two parallel wires have attraction when the direction of electric current is the same and repulsion is opposite

 Induction was also studied later by Naiman and Weber, but Clark Maxwell made significant use of the ideas of inspiration in 1851 and established 'maxwell equations' to give electromagnetic principles a solved form of mathematics
 aadhunik bhautikee main in samikarnon kaa vishesh sthaan he
 In 1822, Jabek observed that if two dissimilar metals were combined in one circuit and one joint was heated, the circuit would conduct electricity
 aisi vidyut ko 'ooshmaa vidyut' kehete hai
 In 1826, George Simon Om established the famous 'om's law'
 san 1841 main jul ne vidyut ke ooshmaa prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa batalaaya ki kisi cell kii rasinic urja, jo paripath main dhara pravaahit karti he, us paripath main utpaadit ooshmaa urja ke baraabar hoti he
 Helm Holtz, William Tomson, Calvin, Lardon, etc
 developed other theories related to electric energy
 san 1848 main kirkhhaaf ne vidyuddhara sambandhi niyamon ko prastut kiya
 In 1851, Lord Kelvin analyzed thermodynamics by theories of thermodynamics

 pentium dul-kor brands kaa upyog intel ke menstream x86-sanrachana vaale microprocessron ke liye 2006 se 2009 tak kiya gaya tha jab ise nayaa naam pentium diya gaya
 The processors are based on either 32-bit Yonah or 64-bit merom-2m, Allendale and wolfdale-3m cores, which are designed to target mobile or desktop computers
 diye hue kaald aavruti main suvidhaon, mulya evam pradarshan ke anusaar, pentium dul-kor processron ko intel ke utpaada prakaaron main seleron ke upar kintu kor tathaa kor 2 ke neeche rakhaa gaya
 The Pentium was also a more popular choice for dual-core overclocking, as it can provide the best performance at a lower cost
 2006 main, intel ne pentium trademark ke bazaar se hatane ke baad single-kor vaale conro-l par aadhaarit lekin 1 mabibite cash ke kam-laagat vaale kor microarchitekchar processron ko sanrachanaatmak utpaada ke rup main bazaar main pun: laane ke yojana kii ghoshnaa kii

 a single-core conroe-l with 1 megabyte of cache was not considered capable enough to differentiate the planned pentiums with the celerons, so the dual-core CPU was replaced and the "dual-core" that category
 Added to sampoorn 2009 ke dauraan, intel ne apane prakashnon main naam ko pentium dul-kor se badalakar waapas pentium kar diya
 kuch processron ko donon naamon se bechaa gaya, lekin haal ke E5400 se E6800 desktop or SU4100 / T4x00 mobile procesar aadhikarik rup se pentium dul-kor shrenee kaa hissaa nahin the
 The first processor to use this brand appeared in notebook computers in early 2007
 Those processors, named the Pentium T2060, T2080 and T2130, had a 32-bit Pentium M-derived Yonah core, and were almost identical to the Core Duo T2050 except for the use of a 1 megabyte L2 cache instead of a 2 megabyte cache
 Was
 un sabhi teenon main 533 megahertz kaa ek FSB tha jo sipiu ko memory se jodta tha
 Intel developed the Pentium dual-core at the request of laptop manufacturers
 iske baad 3 june 2007 ko, intel ne desktop pentium dul-kor brands vaale processron ko jari kiya jinhen E2140 or E2160 ke rup main janaa gaya
 Later in September 2007 an E2180 model was released
 ye procesar intel 64 ekstansion kaa samarthan karte hai, jo haal ke 64-bit vaale kor microarchitekcharyukt alendel kor par aadhaarit hai
 They were almost identical to the Core 2 Duo E4300 processor except for the use of a 1 megabyte L2 cache in place of a 2 megabyte cache
 un donon main ek 800 megahertz kaa FSB tha
 They aimed at a cheaper market with Intel Celeron-above processors featuring only 512 kilobytes of L2 cache
 aise ek kadam ne pentium brands main ek parivartan laa diya or ise menstream / premium brands vaali apni purv kii sthiti ke bajaay sasti shrenee main hastantarit kar diya
ye sipiu overclock karne main atyadhik sakasham hai
 merom-2m, the mobile version of the Allendale processor, was also launched in 2007, featuring 1 megabyte L2 cache but only 533 MT / s FSB with T23xx processors
 bas clock ko baad main badha kar ek hi daai se bane hue T3xxx pentium processron ke liye 667 MT / s kar diya gaya
 The 45 nanometer E5200 model was released by Intel on August 31, 2008, with a 65 nanometer E21xx series with 2 megabytes of L2 cache and a clock speed of 2
5 ghz
 E5200 model overclock karne main atyadhik sakasham procesar bhi he, jisamen kuch atyadhik utsaahi model drav nitrogen prashithan kaa upyog karte hue 6 gigahertz tak kii kaald gati praapt kar lete hai
 Intel released the E6500K model using this core
 model main ek khuli hui gunak vardhak kii suvidhaayen hai, lekin vartmaan main use keval china main hi bechaa ja rahaa he
 The Penryn core is a successor to the 45 nanometer version of the Merom core and Intel's mobile range of Pentium dual-core microprocessors
 isamen FSB ko badhaakar 667 megahertz se 800 megahertz kar diya jaataa he or voltage kam kar diya jaataa he
 Intel released the first Penryn-based Pentium dual-core, T4200 in December 2008
 baad main, penrin par aadhaarit mobile pentium T4000, SU2000 or SU4000 processron ko bazaar main paintium ke rup main bechaa gaya
 In early 2010, the Pentium dual-core brand has been discontinued and replaced by the name Pentium
 desktop E6000 shrinkhalaa or oem-maatr mobile pentium SU2000 or baad ke sabhi modelon ko hameshaa pentium kaha jaataa tha, lekin desktop pentium dul-kor E2000 or E5000 shrinkhalaa vaale processron kaa naveen namakaran kiya janaa tha
 Although using the name Pentium, the desktop Pentium is based on a dual-core core microarchitecture, which can be clearly seen when comparing its characteristic feature to Pentium D, the first netburst microarchitecture used in Pentium 4
 based on
 2 yaa 4 mabibite ke saajha-l2-cash samarthit kor 2 duo, desktop pentium dul-kor main 1 yaa 2 mabibite kaa saajha L2 cash hota he
 In contrast, Pentium d processors have a non-shared L2 cache of either 2 or 4 megabytes

 tatpashchaat chini samyavaadee dal tathaa kuomitanga ke bich matbhed utpann hone lage
 In fact, the Chinese communists were trying to strengthen their organization
 unhone kisaanon or mazdooron ko apane paksh main sangathit kiya or rashtriya str par ek majdoor sangh kii sthapana kii
 As a result, the frequency of strikes and demands of workers increased
 isi tarah kisaanon ke sangh bane jinhone lagaan main kami tathaa jameendaari unmoolan kii maang kii
 After the death of Sanayat Sen in 1925, Maotse Tung launched a fierce peasant movement in Hunan Province
 is andolan ne na sirf jameendaaron ko ukhaad phenkaa balki sampatti par kabja kar samaaj ke dhaanche ko badla
 After the death of Sunayat Sen, Chuang Kai-shek became the chief of the Kuomitang Dal
 uski sadbhaavna vyavsaasiyon va jameendaaron ke saath thi
 He expelled the Communists from the Kuomitang Dal
 chyang kaa maananaa tha ki communist shaktishaalee hote ja rahe hai jo jameendaaron par akraman kar unki sampatti par kabja kar rahe hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate them
 chyang kaai shaike ne communiston ko party se nikaal kar shuddhikaran andolan chalaaya jisamen hajaaron communist, trade unionist tathaa kisaan netaa maare gaye
 In this way Chiang Kai-shek firmly established his power in Nanking
 1943 i
 main maotse tung chini communist party kii kendriya samiti kaa adhyaksh hua or sheershasth netaa ban gaya
 The Communist Party under Mao's leadership expanded its power and made it the center of power in the "qiangsi" province
 dhire-dhire frukien, hunaan aadi praanton main bhi apni satta sarkarein sthapit kii
 Meo made a massive change in the Communist Party's strategy, emphasizing that the Communist Party should try to gain public support among the peasants compared to the industrial laborers
 kaaran yah tha ki china multah ek krishi pradhan desh tha jahaan audyogic kranti abhi pichhadi hui thi
 The Communist Mao government of Qiangsi province did not accept the power of the Kuomitang government of Nanking
 chyang kaai check ke adheen nanking kii sarkaar apni sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye kiyangsi kii communist sarkaar ke viruddh 1934 i
 main bhayankar abhiyaan kiya
 It is known as the "abolition Campaign"
 lakhon kii sankhya main communiston ko maut ke ghat utaara gaya
 In order to avoid this oppression and tyranny, the communists "mahaprasthan" towards the province of Shenxi in the north which started from October 16, 1934 and completed in October 20, 1935
 is 6000 mile lambi duuri ko anek nadiyon, pahaado, jangalon ko paar karte hue shensi praant ke yenon nagar main pahunch kar use rajdhani banaakar vahaan apni sarkaar sthapit kii
 It is worth noting here that in 1921 AD, Japan invaded China
 chyang kaai shaike ne is samay japani khatre se bada khatra samyawad ko samajha or apni sampoorn shakti samyavaadiyon ke daman main laga di
 The Communists established their government in the province of Shenxi, which was near the North China occupied by Japan, and the Communists spoke out against the Japanese invasion and dominance
 maao ne kaha ki kuomitanga or samyavaadiyon donon ko milakar desh main ek sarkaar kii sthapana kerani chahie or milakar japani akraman kaa muqabla kar, unhen desh main ek sarkaar kii sthapana kerani chahie or milakar japani akraman kaa muqabla kar, unhen desh se baahar kar dena chahie
 Due to this view of the communists, the majority of the Chinese people joined them and as a result, the communists got a chance to increase their power
 chyang kaai shaike japaniyon ko rokane ke bajaay communiston kaa safaya karnaa adhik mahatvapurn maanata tha or isliye 1936 main samyavaadiyon se sangharsh karne ke liye liyang ke netritv main ek sena shensi praant bheji kintu samyavaadiyon ne apane chini bhaiyon se ladanaa uchit nahin samajha or liyang ke adheen bheji gai sena ko rashtriya chetana se yukt kar japaniyon se sangharsh karne ko kaha
 When Chiang Kai-shek spoke of the suppression of the Communists, Liang held him captive, but eventually he was freed by the Communists' intervention
 atah chini lokmat kii ichha ko dekhte hue chyang ne samvaadiyon ke saath baatcheet aarambh kii or 1937 main ek samjhauta kiya taaki sammilit prayaas karte hue japan ke prabhutv ko nasht kiya ja sake
 According to the agreement, the Communists' rule over the Shenxi and Kangsu provinces of northwestern China was accepted and the communist army was considered part of China's national army, which was to follow the orders of General Secretary Chiang Kai-shek against Japan
 is prakaar china main do pruthak-pruthak sarkaar is samay vidyaman thi
 Both had their own separate armies and both were ready to develop governance and social order according to their ideals in their respective regions
 yah samjhauta samyavaadiyon kii shakti ko badhaane main atyant mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In 1937, Japan invaded and defeated China and captured China
 nanking par japan kaa adhikaar ho jane se chyang kaai shaike ko peeche hatana padaa or pashchim main chungking ko apni rajdhani bananaa padaa
 On the other hand, the staunch Communists in the Shenxi province led an effective guerrilla fight against Japan in the north and presented themselves as patriotic nationalists to the people
 is kaaran japani atyaachaar se peedit kisaanon or madhyavarg kaa baari samarthan mila
 Meanwhile the Second World War started and the sino-japanese War became part of the Second World War
 us samay bhi chyang kaai shaike samyavaadiyon ko badhati shakti se chintit tha, japani akraman se nahin
 He gave more importance to China's internal politics than to the struggle against Japan
 atah samyavaadiyon tathaa kuomitanga ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti punah utpann ho gai
 With the onset of World War II, the sino-japanese War was influenced by american-british policies
 america or britain ne chyang kaai shaike ke sarkaar kii madad hetu vayuyan dwaara lakhon ton yuddh saamagree pahunchaai taaki japan yaa rus kaa prabhaav china main na bade
 In fact, a major reason for America's and Britain's interference in China's internal affairs was their opposition to communist ideology
 britain va america china main grihayuddh ko rokna chaahate the kyonki grihayuddh kii sthiti main shaktishaalee ho chuke samyavaadiyon kii vijay nishchit praayah najar aa rahi thi
 The United States and Britain entered into a treaty with Chungqing in 1943 to favor the Chiang Koi Shek government
 sandhi ke tahat china main in donon deshon ne apane visheshadhikaron ko tyaag diya or yah sweekaar kiya ki china raajnneetik drushti ke paashchaatya deshon ke samakaksh he or sansar kaa ek pramukh shaktishaalee rajya he
 The Allies, including the US, wanted the Chiang Kai-shek government of China to continue the war with Japan and not compromise with it
 saath hi vah samyavaadee sarkaar ke saath milakar japaniyon kaa muqabla kare
 Operationalized with this aim, the US, through General Steelwell and US Ambassador Hurley, tried to reach a compromise between Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists and confront the Japanese together, but the US failed and the agreement between the two Could not happen 1945 i
 main japan ne aatmasamarpan kar diya or dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa ant ho gaya, kintu china kii samasya kaa ant nahin hua
 In fact, Japan had control in Nanking and after the end of the war the problem arose whether the Kuomitang government of Chungqing occupied the occupied territories of the Nanking government or the Kuomitang government of Chungqing over the occupied territories of the communist government of Yenan province or the province of Yenan province
 Of the communist government, both parties went ahead to control Nanking
 atah china main punah grihayuddh kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 The US sent General Marshall in 1945 to negotiate a settlement between the two parties and to establish democracy to avert civil war
 marshall ke prayaason se 10 janvari 1946 ko yah samjhauta sampann hua
 According to the agreement, the party whose army has the right will be in the right of the same army, but this agreement was not permanent and civil war started on the rights of all the states
 samyavaadee sena ne uttari evam purvi china ke anek pradeshon par apana adhikaar sthapit kiya
 By January 1949, the Communists took control of Tintasin and Peking, and later Nanking, Shanghai Hanko and Canton, and on October 1, 1949, the Communists declared a "people's State" in Peking, and many countries including the Soviet Union Gave recognition to the communist government
 is prakaar china main samyavadi kranti safal hui
 The Kuomitang government of Chiang Kai-shek remained confined in the island of Parmosa
 america ne china kii samyavaadee sarkaar ko manyata na dekar formosa sthit rashtravaadi sarkaar ko china kii sarkaar ke rup main manyata di or apana sambandh banaae rakhaa
 In fact, the US could not openly support Chiang even though the US wanted in the conflict between the Communists and Chiang Kai-shek, because then Russia would have come in support of the Communists
 is dasha main america-rus ke bich pratyaksh sangharsh kii sambhaavna banati
 As a result, the United States often supported the policy of neutrality, and this made Chiang Kai-shek's political situation extremely weak
 1
 kuomitanga dal kii alokapriyata evam bhrasht shashan : chyang kaai shaike ke netritv main kuomitanga sarkaar bhrasht or nikammi thi
 He had nothing to offer to the public as an improvement
 unhone aise kisi kaarykram kii ghoshnaa nahin kii jisase vyapak jansamarthan hasil kiya ja sake
 Not only this, the Kuomitang government wasted most of its time protecting the interests of industrialists, bankers and landlords
 shashan main bhrashtachar vyaapt tha, janata ke upyog hetu laai gai saamagree nijee vyapaarik sadhano main prayukt ho rahi thi, aisi sthiti main sarkaar ne jansamarthan kho diya
 2
 Weaknesses of Military Organization and Military Strategy: The military weakness of the Kuomitang Dal was that there was a feeling of opposition to it that its top government employee was very corrupt and incompetent
 sainikon ko samay par vetan nahin miltaa tha
 The recruitment and promotion of soldiers was based on devotion rather than merit
 grihayuddh ke dauraan chyang ke sarkaar kii sainya kamajori evam ayogyata spasht ho gai vastutah chyang kii sena ne yuddh kaa sanchaalan bade-bade shaharon ko kendra bana kar kiya, parantu ye shahar samyavaadiyon dwaara chaaron ore se gher liye gaye
 In contrast, the communist army was efficient and efficient
 unhone gorilla paddati kii ranneeti apanaakar yuddh kiya, sena main anushaasan banaae rakhaa
 As a result, they succeeded against the nationalists
 3
 samaaj ke vibhinn virgon main saamaajik-aarthik asantosh : kuomitanga sarkaar dwaara kisaanon kii garibi ko dur karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The condition of the farmers suffering from drought and famine was poor, on the other hand, there was no shortage of food grains by the profiteers and merchants in the cities
 america prabhutv china main atyadhik tha or videshi poonjipati china kaa jamkar shoshan kar rahe the
 The Kuomitang government was unable to stop this exploitation
 faltah saamaanya janata sahit poonjipati varg ke log bhi sarkaar ke virdohi ho gaye
 In fact, the Kuomitang government did not offer any concrete socio-economic program to gain public support whereas the communists gained public support by presenting such a program
 4
 rashtravaadi sarkaar kaa samrajyavaadee shaktiyon ke saath sambandh : china kii rashtravaadi kuomitanga sarkaar kaa america jaise samrajyavaadee deshon ke saath sambandh tha
 The Chinese economy was operating from American economic imperialist policy
 china kii baking vyavastha par america bank kaa niyantran tha
 There was an excessive amount of American goods coming into China
 1848 tak yah maatra itani adhik ho gai thi ki china kii adhikansh audyogic ikaiyaan band ho gai or tamaam majdoor bekaar ho gaye
 This is the reason why the peasant-laborers etc
, dissatisfied with the policy of the government, supported the Chinese Communists in the civil war
 faltah samyavaadiyon ko safalataa mili
 5
 Chiang Kai-shek's short-sightedness: Chiang Kai-shek introduced short-sightedness in the Japanese invasion and relations with the Communists
 usne japani akraman ke khatre se kahin zyada bada khatra samyavaadiyon ko mana or samyavaadiyon ke daman kaa prayaas kiya
 While the Communists countered the Japanese invasion against China's interests and fought back in their territories, the Communists gained public support in this situation and the Communists succeeded in defeating Chiang Kai-shek in the Civil War

 Generally, Kurmali literature can be divided into two parts: Kurmali folk literature and Kurmali Shishta literature
 lok sahitya main un saahitiyon ko rakhte hai, jinke udgam, kaal-nirdhaaran, yaa lekhak sambandhi koi nishchit anumaan lagaana sambhav nahin he
 This literature is a compilation of that developed traditional knowledge and literature of the Kurmi civilization that has been inherited by the Kurmali-speaking people in folk tales, folk songs, etc
 for generations

 adhiktar mahilaayein is galat faimi main hoti he ki safed pani ke jane se sharir main kamajori aati he, chakkar aata he, badan main dard hota he
 In the provinces of India and neighboring countries, mistaken belief has been prevalent since ancient times
 safed pani kaa nikalnaa do pramukh kaarnonse hota he
 White water release occurs naturally in some quantity in women
 visheshat: maahvaaree ke purv, maahvaaree ke baad, andotsarg ke samay ar kamechha uddipt hone par swaabhaavik he
 It does not require any treatment
 It is enough to give the correct information
 shwet pradar yaa leukoria yaa liquoria yaa "safed pani aana" strion kaa ek rog he jisamen stri-yoni se asaamaanya maatra main safed rang kaa gaadha or badboodaar pani nikalataa he or jiske kaaran ve bahut ksheen tathaa durbal ho jaati he
 Leucorrhoea is common in women
 ye guptangon se pani jaisaa bahane vaala straav hota he
 It is not a disease itself but is caused by many other diseases
 shwet pradar vastav main ek beemaari nahin he balki kisi anya yonigat yaa garbhashaygat vyaadhi kaa lakshan he; yaa saamanytah prajnan angon main sujan kaa bodhak he
 Natural leucorrhoea safed pani kaa nikalnaa nimnan paristhiti main swaabhaavik hota he: The emergence of white water occurs when there is a lot of work stimulation
 yah pani chikanahat utpann karata he
 Naturally, this arrangement is very useful for sexual intercourse
 yah safed pani jab bhi kaamuk uttajna man main ho tab tab nikalataa he chaahe aap vivaahit ho yaa avivaahit| iske nikalanese naa kamajori, naa dard, naa anya kisibhi prakaar kaa swasth par hanikaarak prabhaav hota he
 If it is not produced in the right amount, then sexual intercourse can be painful

 Excessive fasting, provocative fantasies, obscene conversations, oral sex, use of inverted orgasm during intercourse, excessive frictional trauma during intercourse, coitus with a diseased man, excessive sexual intercourse with two to three males, clean vagina after coitus Not washing with and remaining dirty likewise, are the main causes of this disease
 baar-baar garbhpaat karana bhi safed pani kaa ek pramukh kaaran he
 Another cause of white water is protists, which are a group of microbes
 iske liye sabase pehle jaruri he saaf-safai - yoni ko dhone ke liye sarvottam upaay fitkaree ke jal se dhonaa he; fitkaree ek shreshth jeevanu naashak sasti aushadhi he, sarvasulabh he
 Boric acid solution can also be used and if it is to be washed with an atomizer for internal cleaning, it is best to use the highly effective medicine of Ayurveda, "narayana oil"
 yoni maarg se safed, chipchipa gadha srav hona aaj madhya umr kii mahilaon kii ek saamaanya samasya ho gai he
 In general language, it is called white water
 bhartiya mahilaon main yah aam samasya praayah bina chikitsa ke hi rah jaati he
 Worst of all, it is not very commonly taken care of by women, concealing the mucous secretions from the walls of the vagina or from the cervix in the leucorrhea, the volume, position and duration of which vary in different women
 Is different
 yadi srav zyada maatra main, pilaa, haraa, nila ho, khujali paidaa karne vaala ho to sthiti asaamaanya maani jaaegi
 This causes the body to weaken and the leucorrhoea increases due to weakness
 iske prabhaav se haath-pairon main dard, qamar main dard, pindliyon main khinchaav, sharir baari rahanaa, chidchidapan rahata he
 In this disease, there is white, sticky, thick, smelly discharge from the vagina of the woman, this is called vaginal discharge
 is rog ke kaarnon kii jaanch stri rog visheshgy, ladi doctor se kara lenaa chahie, taaki us kaaran ko dur kiya ja sake
 The discharge of cervical mucus is called vaginal discharge
 agar srav kaa rang, gandh yaa gaadhaapan asaamaanya ho athwa maatra bahut adhik jaan pade to ho saktaa he ki rog ho
 Vaginal discharge is a normal process that changes according to the menstrual cycle
 darasal yah srav yoni ko svachh tathaa snigdh rakhane kii prakritik prakriya he vahiin andotsarg ke dauraan yah srav isaliye bad jaataa he taaki andanu aasaani se tair sake
 a large amount of mucus is formed before ovulation
 yah safed rang kaa chipchipa padaarth hota he
 But in many circumstances, when its color changes and it starts smelling bad, then it becomes a symptom of the disease
 safed yonic sravah masik chakra ke pehle or baad main patala or safed yonic srav saamaanya he
 Usually, there is no itching or choking with white vaginal discharge
 yadi iske saath khujali ho rahi he to yah khamir sankraman ko pradarshit karata he
 Clean and spread: This is the fertile mucosa
 iskaa aashay he ki aap andotsarg ke chakra main hai
 Clean and watery: This secretion usually occurs in women at different times throughout the cycle
 yah baari tab ho jaataa he jab vyaayaam yaa mehnat kaa kaam kiya jaataa he
 Yellow or Green: This discharge is not considered normal and is a symptom of the disease
 yah yah darshata he ki yoni main yaa kahin teevr sankraman he
 Especially when it is like cheese and has a bad smell, one should immediately go to the doctor
 bhurah yah srav aksar maahvaaree ke baad dekh ne ko miltaa he
 Actually it is a natural process of "cleaning"
 puraane rakt kaa rang bhura sa ho jaataa he saamaanya prakriya ke tahat shleshma ke saath baahar aata he
 Raktim patches / brown secretions: This secretion can occur during ovulation / mid-menstrual period
 kai baar baar shuruuaati garbhavastha ke dauraan bhi yah srav dekhne ko miltaa he
 On this basis, it is sometimes considered a sign of conception
 saamaanya yonic srav kii maatra main nimnlikhit sthitiyon main vruddh ho sakati he- yonparak uttejnaa, bhavatmak dabaav or andotsarg These may be due to abnormal vaginal discharge- Infections caused by vaginal relations, which weaken the immunity of the body or those who have diabetes, can be a contagious disease commonly called fungal yeast in the vagina
 yonic srav se bachane ke liye – It is necessary to keep the genitals area clean and dry
 yoni ko bahut bhigona nahin chahie bahut si mahilaayein sochati hai ki maahvaaree yaa sambhog ke baad yoni ko bharpoor bhigone se ve saaf mahasoos karengi vastutah isse yonic srav or bhi bighad jaataa he kyonki usase yoni par chaaye swasth bacteria mar jate hai jo ki vastutah use sankramak rogon se bachaate hai Avoid pressure
 yon sambandhon se lagane vaale rogon se bachane or unhen failane se rokane ke liye condom kaa istemaal avashya karnaa chahie
 If there is diabetes, blood sugar should be kept under control
 haa, sheeghra hi doctor se paraamarsh lenaa chahie
 They will check your symptoms, test the genitals and tell treatment accordingly
