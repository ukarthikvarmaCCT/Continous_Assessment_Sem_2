 sanjana, ek bahut anaadi kism kii aurat he jo france main apane ankal ke saath rahati he or apane pyaar rahul se shaadi karne vaali he
 Rahul will have to go to India in connection with work and Sanjana insists on going with him, when she is afraid to go to the plane
 jab plane udne ke liye taiyaar hota he sanjana kaa dar had paar kar detaa he or vah plane se utarane ki jid karti he
 One day Rahul accidentally tells Sanjana that he has fallen in love with Nisha and he cannot come back to Paris and marry Sanjana
 sanjana faisla karti he ki vah rahul ko waapas laaegi chaahe kuch bhi ho, chaahe use plane main bhi kyon na baithna pade
 When the plane is ready to fly, a passenger sits with it named Shekhar
 usko ehsaas hota he ki sanjana ko udne se dar lagata he to vah usko gussa dilaakar uskaa dhyaan bataata he
 While on the plane, Sanjana accidentally sprays alcohol on Shekhar and realizes that he is hiding something
 shekhar bathroom pahunchaata he or apane jeb se ek paudha nikaalata he
 When he removes the cloth from the plant, we realize that Shekhar is actually a thief and has stolen a diamond necklace from Paris and hid it in a plant

 But Sanjana is in love with Shekhar and she can never tell him

 Mimamsa Darshan is one of the six Darshans of Hindus
 paksh-pratipaksh ko lekar vedavakyon ke nirnit arth ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 The above idea is from the earlier Aryan tradition
 kintu aaj se praaia: sava paanch hajaar varsh purv samaveda ke acharya krishna dwaipayan ke shishy ne use sutarabaddh kiya
 The sutras refer to Badarayana, Badari, Atreya, Ashmarathya, Drafting, Etishayan, Kamukayan, Kartajajini and Labukayana Maharshias as complete aspects and principles, which are detailed in the annotations and discourses of the sutras, which have become millennials
 
 is shaastra kaa purvamimasaa ar veydant kaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Purmimamsa, there is the idea of religion and in Uttara Mimamsa there is the idea of brahma
 atah purvamimasaa kaa dharmamimasaa ar uttar mimasaa kaa brahmamimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 From the sutra composed by Jaimini Muni, Mimamsa is called Jaminian Dharmamimamsa
 german vidwaan maxmooler kaa kahana he ki - "yah darshan shaastra koti main nahin aa saktaa, kyonki isamen dharmanushthan kaa hi vivechan kiya gaya he
 There is no discussion of Jiva, God, Bandha, Moksha and their means anywhere
 " Some Indian scholars who are biased to Maxmuller's opinion also hesitate to call it philosophy, because in the Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta the evidence and theorems in the then cases are mainly about the soul-self, Bandha-moksha etc
 Discretion is received, the same philosophy is not visible in the formulas, commentary and talk etc
 uparyukt vichaarkon ne sthool buddhi se granth kaa adhyayan kar apane vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 Yet it is clear that the philosophy of Mimamsa is the contributory cause of all philosophies
 jaimini ne in vishyon kaa beej rup se apane sutron main upanyaas kiya he "satsamprayoge purushasyendriyanaa buddhi janm tat pratyakshm" chaturth sutara main do shabd aae hai - purush or buddhi
 The word "soul" differs from the male word
 yah arth kumaril bhatta ne "bhaattdipika" main likhaa he
 The word wisdom has conveyed the meaning of knowledge, pramata, theorem and proof
 vrittikaar ne "tasya nimitt parishti:" paryat teen sutron main pratyaksh, anumaan shabd, arthapati or anuplabdhi pramaanon kaa saparikar vishad vivechan tathaa autpattik sutara main aatmavaad kaa vishesh vivechan apane vyaakhyaan main kiya he
 The same has been analyzed in texts like Shabar Bhashya, Shloka Vartik, Shastradipika, Bhatt Chintamani, etc
, wherein there is a distinction between proofs and theorems, Bandha, Moksha and their means
 mimasaa darshan main bharatvarsh ke mukhya prandhan dharm kaa varnashram vyavastha, aadhanadi, ashwamedhant aadi vichaaron kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Often, knowledgeable and disinterested men have been everywhere in the world, but the learned philosophers of rituals and rituals of rituals have been learned in India only

 a scholar says - arthath jaise koi manushya samudr paryant jane kii ichha rakhte hue himalay main chalaa jaataa he, usee prakaar dharm ke vyaakhyaan ke icchhuk kanad muni shat padaarthon kaa vivechan karte rah gaye
 Answer: According to the principle of epistemology, right to attain enlightenment is only after the deed, but according to the earlier epistemology philosophy - is vedamantra ke anusaar mumukshu janon ko bhi karm karnaa chahie
 By performing Vedic Karma, the Karmbandhan is automatically terminated - Tasmanmumukhubhi: Karya is the main soul of Indian theistic philosophies according to the verses of Nityamtikam and “adi”
 mimasaa darshan solah adhyyon kaa he, jisamen baarah adhyay krambaddh hai
 Shastra Sangathi is associated with Adhyatagati, Padasangati and Adhyakanti
 in baarah adhyyon main jo chhot gaya he, uskaa nirupan shesh chaar adhyyon main kiya gaya he jo 'sankarshcand' ke naam se prasiddh he
 It discusses the authority of the deity
 at: use 'devtaa cond' bhi kehete hai athwa dwadash adhyyon kaa parishisht bhi kah sakate hai
 Bhaskar Rai Dixit has written at the end of the interpretation of the Sankarshan case that despite reading Shodasadhyayi Mimamsa, the reading was in Dvadashadhyay only in the medieval period
 jis tarah chatushpada gayatri ke rahane par bhi vidvan varg tripada gayatri ko hi japate hai, usee tarah vartmaan kaal main dwadashadhyaayi mimasaa kaa hi adhyayan adhyaapan prachlit he
 According to some scholars, it is difficult to decide the meaning of a sentence without epistemology, because such a sentence is evidence in the present sense or in other sense, the conclusion which comes in the decision of this idea is called epistemology, but here the meaning of the word epistemology is from philosophy
 is
 dharmagyaan ke liye paraspar virodh rahit vedamantron ke arthon ke vichaar kaa naam mimasaa he
 And thoughtfully received theology is the result of epistemology
 yahi baat jaimini ne apane mimasaa darshan main kahi he - athato dharm jigyaasa

 kumaril bhatta ne ise is prakaar varnan kiya he - Further sentence-wise decision-making millennium judgments are described
 yahan tak chah adhyyon kaa sankshipt vishyanirdesh kiya gaya
 In this philosophy, one gets knowledge of duty-abstention from Veda-sentence-decision by considering the objective predicate sentiment obtained from judicious judgment, or from the combustible combustion justice
 isliye dharmagyaan hi mimasaa darshan kaa prayojan he
 In this philosophy there is an undertaking from theology
 vyakaran ke liye "padashastra", vaisheshik nyaay ke liye "pramanshastra" or mimasaa ke liye "vaakyashastra" kaa prayog sanskrit sahitya main hota he
 There is a discussion of religious thought in this scripture
 bhartiya janata kaa mukhya uddeshy dharmanushthan he
 Ritual cannot happen without fruit and fruitfulness cannot be without material means
 at: sankshep main saadhan kaa bhi vivechan kiya jaataa he
 It is necessary to know the symptoms, evidence and means of religion before the ritual
 is shaastra main saadhan, ang or shesh, ye teenon paryaayavachak shabd hai
 Likewise, these three synonyms are Sdhya, Seshi and Angi
 udhaaharan ke liye swargaprapti ke nimitt darsh poornmaas kaa anushthan yadi karnaa ho to usamen darsh or poornmaas angi honge or prayaaj aadi ang honge
 Darsha Yag occurs on Amavasya Tithi and Purnamas Yag occurs on Purnima Tithi
 ) isamen angi pradhan ang kaa prayojak he or ang prayojya he
 In this way, knowing the means of getting the religious ritual requires knowledge of purvaparya as well and in the case of ritualistic agni hotradi karmas for fruits, there is also a discussion of the means of Purvanga and Uttaranga, for which the word "nature" is used
 kintu sauryadi karmke sannidhi main ang kaa paath nahin he
 After the emergence of aspiration at that place, one has to take the organs which are presented in the Darshan Purnamas, which is called as an excess 
 Normally, even if there is a decision, the description of which karma comes in which karma comes, it has been explained by the special instructions
 angon kaa atidesh hone par bhi prakruti main bhed hone ke kaaran praakrit pad ke sthaan par padaantar ko rakhkar paath kiya jaataa he
 For example "agneya tva jushtam nirvapami"
 is shrutivakya main agni pad ke sthaan main "sauryoyeshti" ke suryapad rakhkar "suryaay tvajushta nirvpaami" is shruti ko padhate hai
 Such a sentence is called "ooh"
 in baton ke gyaan bina yah samaj lenaa sambhav nahin he ki kis ang kaa kahan or kaise upyog karnaa chahie jisase anushthan samuchit faldaayak ho sake
 The place where the organ is not read, the organ should be brought from other place, but only those who can do the treatment of deformity can be taken in nature
 jo vikruti main upkaar nahin kar sakate vahaan anya angon kaa adhyaahar nahin hota
 And they do not even have rituals
 aise vachanon ko "baadh" kehete hai
 The decision of which part is obstructed and whose not is subject to "ooh" obstruction
 evam abhipsit faldaata karm ek hi hota he
 But there are many anywhere
 kuch angon kaa anushthan pradhan se purv tathaa kuch kaa pradhan ke pashchaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 For example, Samidheni Prayajadi and a specific follower
 ek hi samay par un angon kaa ek baar athwa anek baar prayog karne ke vishay main kaha gaya he - The name for using once is Tantra and the name for multiple times is "frequency" or "movement"
 kahin kahin angon kaa tantra se anushthan hota he or kahin kahin aavriti se
 Therefore the idea of tantra and movement is also necessary
 kisi fal vishesh ke liye pradhan angi kaa anushthan karte hai or uske angon ko bhi karte hai
 Those organs which require the use of other organs also need to be referred to as context
 isamen pradhan tantri hota he, jise prasang kehete hai
 For example, the Agnostic animal Purodshadi, the perfected person of the aforesaid subjects, can only perform the Sangopang Dharmanasthana, which is explained by Jamini in "mimamsa Darshan"
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samathrya kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, text, place, main and tendency
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 The ninth chapter represents three types of "oohs" with the distinction of mantroh, samoah and samskarah
 dashamadhyay main arthlope, pratyamnaay or pratishedh ke bhed se teen prakaar ke baadh kaa nirupan hai
 Ekadasadhyaya has the representation of Tantra and Aavya
 dwadashadhyay main "prasang" kaa nirupan he
 Thus one subject has been rendered in philosophical epistemology philosophy which has also been called "dvadashalini"
 yahan lakshan shabd adhyaywachak he
 It has been divided in two ways, which is called preaching and overtaking
 pratham adhyyon main upadesh kaa vivechan he
 The six chapters of the second describe the overarching narrative
 ukt upadesh atidesh dway vichaaratmak shaastra he
 According to Shastra Deepikaar Parthasarathi Mishra, the beginning of the idea of precept is different from the precept
 vartmaan kaal main uplabdh mimasaa darshan main dwadash adhyay hai
 Each chapter has four legs, but the third, shashtha and tenth chapters have eight pahadas, also known as "shabara" chapters
 is tarah sampurna granth main saath paad hai
 There is controversy in the thread of this philosophy
 kisi ke mat main do sahasr chah sau baawan, kisi ke mat main do sahasr saat sau bayalis sutara hai
 The above description is propounded in the book page four of "aasikit" called "karmamimansa"
 anand ashram puna se prakashit "nyaayamala" main do sahasr saat sau pantalis sutron kaa pratipaadan he
 Similarly, the tribunal number of some persons is nine hundred and seven
 kuch ke mat se nau sau pandrah sutara hai
 But according to Shankar Bhatt, the doer of the "mimamsaar collection", there are five hundred thirty in "purushtak", four hundred and seventy sutras in Uttarashtak
 is prakaar sampurna adhikaran ek sahasr sankhya main vibhajit he
 According to the above verses, the number of tribunals is one thousand two hundred and fifty
 anek sutron se ek adhikaran banataa he, jisamen ek pradhan sutara tathaa anya gun sutara hote hai
 The principal sutra presupposes the antecedent and the other sutras form the principle
 kahin kahin par do sutron ke dwaara purvottar paksh kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 In such a way, the principle has been formulated by raising the former side without the formula
 kahin kahin siddhant rup se upkram dwaara purv paksh kar siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 There are certain tribunals in a foot
 udaahranarth pratham paad main aath adhikaran hai
 The Tribunal has six substances - subject, doubt, antecedent, principle purpose and consistency
 sangati teen prakaar kii hoti he - shaastra sangati, adhyay sangati or paad sangati
 First Sutra - The name of the first tribunal is the curiosity tribunal
 vichaar shaastra vishay he
 There is doubt as to whether or not the idea is worth starting
 aarambh karne yogya nahin he, yah purv paksh he
 The theory is that thought science should be started
 is vishay kaa mul he kumaril bhatta ke mat main adhyayan vidhi or "prabhakar" mat main adhyaapan vidhi
 On the east side there is the invisible purpose of study and in the theory side, the meaning-knowledge-form is the objective view
 dharm ke vichaar shaastra sambandhi hone ke kaaran is vichaar shaastra main iskaa vivechan sangat he
 In this tribunal, study is parable, this has been proved
 atev vichaar shaastra kaa mul adhyayan vidhi he
 The means of semantics is obscured by the study method
 isiilie vichaar shaastra kaa aarambh vaid he
 Second Sutra - The Second Tribunal has the character and proof of religion, whose duty is reflected in the law
 vah shrey kaa saadhan he
 Here the word Shraya means both physical and spiritual meaning
 gamy dharm main gamak vidhivaakya pramaan hota he
 That which is propounded by prohibition is a means of evil, it is called unrighteousness
 tritiy sutara - tritiy adhikaran main vidhi vaakya hi pramaan he
 Only pledge is done here
 ve do prakaar kahi hai - "chodanaiv lakshann yasya, chodana lakshanmev yasya" arthath yahan pratyaksh aadi pramaan dharm se pramaan nahin hote, kintu vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan mana gaya he
 Fourth Sutra - This Sutra has the fourth tribunal to support the first pledge
 is adhikaran main lok siddh pratyaksh pramaan kaa lakshan - "indriarthsannikarshajanyan gyaanan pratyakshm"
 That is, the direct takes on the present approximate and the religion is originating, so there can be no proof in the direct religion, because the religion is future
 in vachanon se mimasaakaar ne pratyakshopjivi anumaan ushmaan or arthapatti ko bhi pramaan nahin mana he
 Pancham Sutra - The fourth sutra is supported by the fifth curse of the fifth sutra by supporting the first curiosity of the fourth tribunal
 is adhikaran main vidhivaakya hi pramaan he, isi pratigya kaa samarthan kiya gaya he
 In this context, the authenticity of proofs is automatically generated and accepted automatically
 arthath gyanjanak saamagree se pramanya utpann hota he or usee saamagree se pramanya gruhit bhi hota he
 Sentences are of two types - cosmic and Vedic
 loukik vaakya paurushey hone ke kaaran purushgat bhram, pramaad, vipralambh, karnapatav aadi dosha se yukt hota he, atev paurushey vaakya pramaan nahin hota
 The mantra is the Brahminical word Veda Apaurusheya
 at: vidhivaakya main apramanya ke kaaran bhramaadi nahin hone se vidhivaakya hi dharm main pramaan hai
 To support this second promise, the sign of the proof and the relation of the word is continual
 baadaraayan ne bhi pramanya main parapeksha ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 In substance-rendering, there is a relation between matter by word, in scripture-rendering, and in composition by man
 shabd or arth kaa vachya-vaachak-sambandh nity maanakar veda main purush-pravesh kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 That is, the Vedas are penned by the Purusha - the reason for saying this is that we have never heard, read or known the sentences without the person
 jabaki mimasakon ke mat main shabd tathaa uske dwaara pratipaadya ghatapatadi-arth kaa sambandh nity he
 Therefore, 'this verse explains this meaning' - even if we do not know this verse, the verse itself tells its performance
 arthath shaktigrah na hone par bhi pad main pratipaadansamrthy he hi
 And there is a tendency for the authorization to separate the male relation by the syntactic relation
 is adhikaran main yatha pad kii padaarth main shakti hoti he, vaise hi vaakya kii vaakyarth main shakti hoti he, aise jo pratipaadan karte hai uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, kyonki pad se upasthit padaarth hi aakanksha, yogyata or aasakti se anvit hokar anshatray vishisht bhaavnarup vaakyarth kaa pratipaadan karata he
 The grammaticalization is governed by the syntactic syntax
 is mat ke anusaar shabdabodh main padaarthon kaa paraspar sambandh sansarg maryaada se bhaasata he
 This is the opinion of the Naiyayikas, which connotes the separation of power in the sentence, but Kumaril Bhatt has supported the designation
 prabhakar ne anvitabhidhan kaa samarthan kiya he
 In this way, the male clause in the sentence is repealed in the second way
 tritiy prakaar granth rachana dwaara hota he
 The reference sentence has a relationship with the man in two ways, one by the katru-karma-bhava-relation and the second by the applied-discourse-bhava-relation
 pravachan sarsaadhaaran or rachana asaadhaaran hoti he
 Is an extraordinary adjective
 atev veda paurushey he
 According to some scholars, the Vedas are called Purusparnait or Pourusheya due to the instructions of man, country, river, tree etc
 in the Vedas, but according to Mimamsa philosophy the discourse is also considered extraordinary
 udaahranarth "kathsamhita" athwa "kath brahman" ke vishay main kinvadanti he ki anek shakha adhyayiyon ke madhya "ksht" maharishi ne purna rup se adhyayan kiya tha
 It is for the second that the name of man, river, etc
 comes in the Vedas, this also proves the Veda Pourusheya, but this imagination is not clever-wise-prescribing; Because often the names of worldly things have come from the Vedas, the tradition of folk-names has gone on from that point of view
 arthath veda itihaas ko anitya nahin maanata, kintu itihaas ke nityatv kaa pratipaadan karata he, iskaa vistrut vivechan mimasaa ke "shabarabhashya" main drushtavy he
 The regular subject and sentence or word are seen in the earliest Brahmarsigan Samadhi, so the Vedas do not include the image of the forefathers
 " loukik rachanaayen purush vishesh kartrutv hone ke kaaran paurushey hai, yatha mahabharat, ramayana aadi
 According to Kumaril Bhatt, the study tradition is eternal
 atev veda bhi apaurushey hai
 Such tribunal principle cannot be related to justice only through the creation of Vedas, hence the sentence is the proof in religion
 mimasaa-darshan main aatm-tatv kaa pratipadak koi bhi moulik sutara nahin he
 Although Shankaracharya wrote that "pre-tantra" does not contain self-effulgent formulas, he has described the form of self by saying this utterance, in Uttamimamsa's "an Evatman: Sharire Bhavat"
 vrittikaar mat ko pramaan rup se uddhrut karte hue likhaa he : "atmabhidhanprasaktau yathatmastitvan tathaa sharirake vakshyam:"
 The idea is that Purvimamsa, like Uttara Mimamsa, is formed by believing the Advaita soul, however, Purvimamsa is practiced only by considering the subject-subservient self-realization in addition to the body, because Karma-siddhanta consists of "gratitude" and "inattention
" or yaheen se punarjanm aadi kii siddhi bhi hoti he
 "chodna Resume:" "satsamprayogay Purushyendriyamam" Atmabija is rendered from both these sutras
 or vapan aadi sanskaar fali kaa sanskaar he
 In Purusharth, the soul gets fruit from the word Yajna and Krit Yag with the word Purush
 shabar swami ne sutara vishesh ke bina hi "yagyaayudh vaakya" ko nimitt maanakar anaatmavaadi ke mat kaa khandan karte hue aatmaswaroop ko tark or shrutiyon ke dwaara siddh kiya he jisase veda pramanya kii bhi siddhi hoti he
 In post-epistemology, the soul is considered one; But in "samkhya Yoga", justice, vahesika, and premeditation, the soul is considered many, which through karma is related to body, sense and mind
 atev sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandha kaha gaya he
 The above triad puts the soul in bondage, so that the soul suffers a pleasant face: Khadi duality
 nity naimitthik karmon ko katrtavya buddhaya karte hue praarabdh karmon ko jeev bhogata rahata he
 Apart from the body sense, the person who worships the soul with the Brahman intellect has no reason for connection with the sense body, etc
 Such a person becomes self-possessed after the destruction of the present body
 uttarmimasaa ke anusaar sharir, indriya or vishay ko bandhan kaha gaya he jo agyaan kaa kaaran he; uski nivritti hi moksh he
 For example - " nivritiratma mohasy gyatatvenoplakshith: The foreshadowing also accepts that the relation of body, senses and subjects is bondage, and its merger is salvation, whose means, knowledge and action are combined
 atmagyaan do prakaar kaa hota he
 Sharatritik is part of the season of enlightenment, which is free from harmony
 vaidic or loukik vaakyon kaa sahasron kii sankhya main vaakyarth nirnyopayogi nyaayon kaa purvamimasaa ne hi pratipaadan kiya he
 Therefore, the first place in Indian philosophies is that of karma exponent of premodern philosophy
 uttarmimasaa agyaan se sristi or atmagyaan se sristi kaa vinaash maanata he
 Justice, Vaiseshika philosophy has called the destruction of the Mahakrishti till Mahakruti and the destruction of the nuclear atom by Mahabhutla in the double order
 arthath sampurna bhav kaary dvanukadi kram se utpann hote hai or sthool se parmaanu paryant jaakar nasht ho jate hai
 The five atoms of earth, water, light and air are continual in the Panch Mahabhutas
 akaash swayan hi nity he, kintu purv mimasaa ke anusaar do prakaar kii sristi or teen prakaar ke pralay hote hai, jinamein mahasrishti or khand sristi shabd se do sristi kahi gai he
 Three dooms have been called in the same way with the words Pralaya, Mahapralaya and Khanda Pralaya
 unamem khand sristi or khand pralay aajkal ke samaan hi mana gaya he
 For example, a particular site gets destroyed due to earthquake etc
 and somewhere new things are created
 mahasrishti main parmaanuon se dvanukadi dwaara panchmahabhoot paryant navagrahadikon kii sristi hoti he, jiskaa ullekh rugveda ke dasham mandal main praapt hota he - In Matsyapuranadi, one also gets a description of the status of the substances present under the block catastrophe, but former epistemology does not accept Mahasruti and Mahapralaya
 uske anusaar sabhi padaarthon ke naash main koi bhi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 As the narrator has said - mimasaa darshan khand sristi or khand pralay ko hi maanata he
 In Indian six-believer philosophies, the seekers of justice, Vaiseshika and Vedanta are often the same
 udaahranarth "yato vaa imani bhutani jaayante", "dyavabhumi janayan dev ek:" "vishwasya katrta bhuvnsy gopta" in shrutiyon ke dwaara or "janmadyasya yat:" is vedant sutara ke dwaara ishwar kii siddhi hoti he
 Similarly, God has also been proved by the "kshitankuradik Kartajranya Karyavat Ghatavat" conjecture in the jurisprudence, but the Vedantis have proved God by the Shrutis as their cooperative reason
 or naiyayikon ne anumaan se ishwar ke siddh kar shrutiyon ko sahakaari kaaran mana he
 There are two views in Sankhya philosophy - Sesvara and Nirishwar
 seshwar sankhyavaadee ishwar ko maanate hai, kintu use purush vishesh shabd se vyavhaar karte hai
 The Niraश्वरvara Samāhākāvī करतेa denies God, "but the science monk has accepted God by referring to the verse" Ishvarasiddhe: "in this sutra as" proof
 mimasaa darshan naiyayikon ke samaan vidhi mukh se ishwar kaa samarthan ar nirishwar sankhyavaadiyon ke samaan nishedh bhi nahin karata, kintu "sambandhakshepaprihaar" granth main kumaril bhatta ne shabdaarth ke sambandh kaa karta ishwar kaa niraakaran kiya he
 The idea is that the subject of the relationship is not God
 uparyukt vachanon ko sweekaar kar lokprasiddhi he ki mimasak nirishvaravaadi he
 The commentators like Kumaril Bhatt, Nandishwar etc
 have disposed of the supposed God and accepted the Vedasiddha God
 vastutah mimasaa veda se siddh brahm athwa ishwar ko sweekaar karata hi he
 Because the Mimamsa philosophy considers the Veda to be an automatic proof
 mimasaa kaa purvamimasaa ar veydantka uttarmimasaa naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, the principle of Vedanta's philosophy and the principles of Vedanta are valid, it is clear
 vedavihit yagadi karm dravya or devtaa in do se saadhy hai
 The substance is Dadhyadi and the deity is Shastraka Samadhigamgya
 arthath vidhi vaakya jisko devtaa kahata he use hi devtaa mana jaataa he
 Here three aspects about the deity have been accepted in Dasamadhyay's Chaturthpad and in Shabar Bhashya etc
 texts
 arth devtaa, shabd vishisht arth devtaa or shabd devtaa hai
 The last aspect in all three is the principle, because the meaning is remembered by the word
 atev shabd kii pratham upasthiti hone ke kaaran shabd hi devtaa mana gaya he
 For example, in the words "indraya Swaha, Takkshakaya Swaha", these fourth terms Indraya and Takshkaya are deities
 arth ko devtaa sweekaar karne vaale vyakti bhi shabd kii upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, due to the predominance of the word in all the three sides, the Mimansakas have accepted the word as the deity
 yahan par ek niyam he - vidhi vaakya main jo devatavachak shabd he uskaa aavahan, tyaag or sookt vaakya aadi main uccharan karnaa chahie, na ki uske paryaayavachi shabdon ko
 For example, the word "jatvedas", synonymous with fire, should not be used in "agnayamashtakapalam"
 ukt baton se vidit hota he ki "shabdamayi devtaa" hi mimasaa darshan kaa siddhant he
 The idea of vigrahadi Sadasad bhava of the deity - Vigrahadi five of the deity etc
 are considered in this philosophy
 arthath vigrah, havish, bhoga, aishwarya, prasannataa or faldaatrutiv ye paanch vigrah kahe jate hai
 On the basis of the above promise, Vedantis have considered Vigrahadi five forms of the deity
 abhipraay yah he ki manushya aadi ke samaan hi kar, charan aadi avyav devataaon ke bhi hote hai, ve havish sweekaar karte hai, bhakshan karte hai or prasann hokar yajmaan ko fal dete hai
 Hence the deity is vigrahadimana
 uparyukt vichaar hi yask maharishi ne "nirukt" ke "athaakaar chintanam" vaakya se purushvigrahata ko siddh kiya he
 According to the Mimamsa philosophy, "shabdmayi Deity" has been endorsed, but Shabar Swamy has denied the Deity Deity in his best deity authority
 praaia: parthasarathi, khandadev aadi sabhi vidwaanon ne isi maarg kaa avlamban kiya he, kintu kumaril bhatta ne apni tikaa main devtaa ko pradhan na maanakar dravya ke samaan use ang mana he or karm ko hi pradhanthya sweekaar kiya he tathaa kaha he ki karm hi fal detaa he
 No one pleads with the slave while the master is
 karmana phaljanakatvan tathaa shabdamayi devtaa, ukt dway siddhanton kaa samarthan devtaa vigrahadi ko maanakar anya mimasakon ne kiya he
 The deity of the commentary Shabar should be addressed with despotism
 atev purvamimasaa "shabdamayi devtaa" ko hi swikar karata he
 His knowledge, Tadhit, Chaturthi Vibhakti and Mantravan are from these three
 keval inamen paraspar antar yah he ki taddhit shakti kii aavriti se devtaa k bodhan karata he
 Chaturthi explains the Vibhakti symptoms and Mantravarna installations
 mimasaadarshan ne apni karmparakata kii drushti se ukt prakaar se devtaa kaa karm kaa ang mana he
 In fact, the deity is untapped
 nirukt vedang he ar mimasashastra vedapang he
 Therefore, in the context of Vedic deity philosophy, it is necessary to consider the interpretation of the Nirukta as independent and the main deity philosophy
 vaakyon ke dwaara jo bodh hota he use vaakyarth bodh yaa shaabd bodh kehete hai
 The sentence is also a statement - subantachay: vaakyam, tingantayovakyam, suptingntchayo vaakyam
 There are three aspects in it, which should have a causative verb
 amarkosh ke anusaar - "tid
subant chayo vaakyan kriya vaa karkanvita"
 That is, the causative verb of subant and tingant sentences is ejaculatory
 purvamimasaa main kumaril bhatta, prabhakar or murari ke teen mat prasiddh hai, kintu antim main "tripad niti nayan" is naam se khyath granth bhi vidit hua he
 There are two famous departures in the minds of the nominees, Anointedism and Anuvitabhidhanism
 inamen pratham kumaril bhatta or dwitiya prabhakar kaa mat he
 In the Shabdha sense, the sentiment is mainly accepted by Bhatt
 prabhakar ne kaary ko mukhya sweekaar kiya he
 The meaning of the term 'abhidhyataya' means that the substance enlightened by the terms integrates the aspiration, ability and attachment and makes it literal through the signs
 nyaayamat main padon kii padaarth main shakti he or pad gyaan lakshan yaa bodh karte hai
 The positions lead to the presence of matter
 isi prakaar mimasaa main kaha gaya he, udaahranarth jyotishtoman swarg kaamo yajet"
 Here "yajet" has two passages - "yaj" metal and "ta" suffix
 pratyay aakhyaatansh ko lekar aarthi bhaavana kaa pratipaadan karata he
 That feeling has three aspirations - Sādhyākāक्षाa साधa Sādhanākā औरa and "ityākāyātakābakक्षाa"
 saadhyaakanksha hone par swarg kaa saadhyatven anvay hota he
 When there is sadhana, the cause of Dhatworth is unknown
 
 It is an ambivalence that occurs when there is a duty
 vaakyarthaadhikaran main kaha gaya he- The sentence is used in the world to understand the specific meaning
 padashravan se padaarthon kaa pruthak pruthak gyaan hota he
 This is for reading, but the substance that is not intended to the listener and the sentence for which the sentence is used is not the function of the listener, in such a place the meaning of sentence is unacceptable
 atev anupapatti ke nivaranarth lakshana maani gai he
 All philosophers have accepted epigraphy as the seed of symptoms
 padon ke do prakaar ke taatpary maane gaye hai, pratham taatpary tathaa dwitiya mahataatpary
 The first difference refers to the subject matter, and the great phrase implies the subject
 abhihitanvayavaad main vaakya se vaakyarth kaa bodh lakshanya hota he
 Kumaril Bhatt has rendered with the following verses - is vachan se bhatta padka abhihitanvayavaad kaa swaroop digdarshit hota he
 Some scholars state that "ananavitavastha" matter is designated by matter
 unki anvitavastha keval lakshith hoti he
 Thus "anubhitabhidhanism" belongs to Kumaril Bhatt, but what Bhatta's translation translates as Anubhibhidhanism, is not appropriate, because the above article is not discussed anywhere in his texts
 anvitabhidhan shabd kaa yah arth he - pad anvitarth bodhan karte hai
 Therefore, by the power of verse, both the substance and the sentence are realized
 pad shakti se atirikt lakshana aadi maanane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The veteran uses the word to carry an object
 uske paas kaa balak us shabd ko shravan kar ou duusare purush ke le aane or le jane kaa kaary karte dekhakar shabd kaa arth samaj letaa he
 This is the working reason of the trend
 lok main kriya ko bhi kaary samajha jaataa he, usee prakaar veda main bhi yagadi kriya ko prathmat: kaary samajha jaataa he
 Yagadi activity is transient and heaven is eternal in future
 atev ukt veda vaakya vimarsh se yagatirikt "apurv, naamak vastu samajhi jaati he
 Here, the aforesaid two powers of "one work word" have to be accepted in two meanings
 ek main shakti or duusare se lakshana manani hoti he
 It also has special power in supernatural work, as is prevalent among scholars - lok main kriya rup kaary main lakshana hoti he
 In the Vedas, verses are sentences, and substance is a sentence
 is mat main vaakyarth, anvay or sansarg ye sab paryaay hai
 That is, the unknown is the instrument in the unknown
 prabhakar ne graahak grahan ko mana he, usase bhi anvitabhidhanwaad siddh hota he
 In this opinion - "yajet Swargakam:" This sentence gives the literal meaning of Anavitabhidhan
 is darshan main swargaprapti ke liye yag kaa hi vidhaan he
 The meaning of heaven is this - one who does not suffer from sorrow and there is no possibility of causing sorrow and to fulfill the desire, it is called heaven
 "dashampoornamasabhyaan swargakaamo yajet" ityadi vaakyon dwaara darshapurnmaas yag se swarg ke saadhan kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 Yag is considered ephemeral, as Yag is the name of the sacrifice of matter for the purpose of a deity
 "indray idan na mam" is vaakya se maanas vyapaar kaa tyaag hota he
 That business is destroyed in that moment
 niratishay priti vishay ko swarg kaha gaya he
 It is obtained in the period of time or birth
 yah darshan shaastra kaa niyam he, kayontpatti ke avyavhit purv kshan main kaaran ko rahanaa chahie or kshanik yag janmaantar bhavi swargotpatti ke avyavhit purvakshan main sambhav nahin he
 Thus, according to the above Shruti, the attainment of Yag, the means of heaven or the succession of Yag and the precession of the fruit, these are all proved to be an object, which is called extravagance, apurva, or merit
 iskaa vistrut vivechan kumaril bhatta ne apurvaadhikaran main yuktipurvak kiya he
 The man before Yaganushthan does not have the ability to consume heaven
 anushthan ke purv yag main bhi swargadi fal dene kii yogyata nahin hoti evam purush kii ayogyata tathaa karm kii ayogyata kaa niraakaran kar shastragamya samathrya ab vaa atishayyogyata ko apurv mana gaya he
 As ise adhikarapurv athwa falapurv kehete hai
 Where there is only one principal, the incomparable that arises from the principal Yag is called antecedent
 angon se jo apurv utpann hota he, use angaporesv kehete hai
 Both Angaapurava and Pradhanpuram together produce the Holiness
 usase swargadi fal kii prapti hoti he
 Some yagas bear fruit from many heads
 udaahranarth - darsh main teen yag hote hai or paurnmaas main bhi teen yag hote hai
 Here one community pre-arises from the three antecedents arising from the three princes
 donon samudayapurvon se ek parmapurv utpann hota he
 It is meant that in the first example above, three are considered unique
 dwitiya udhaaharan main utpatypurv, angaporesv, samudayapurv or falapurv, chaar apurv maane jate hai
 It is the servants of all the Muslims
 isamen bhatt mimasak shabar bhashya 2
 1
 2 ke "yagen apurv kruthva swarg bhavayet" anusaar shabd se tathaa shrutarthapatti se apurv kii siddhi karte hai
 And consider it to be the main feature in Lingadi's speech and vocabulary
 sabhi darshanikon ke dwaara apurv kaa jo khandan kiya gaya he vah vachyatvansh or praadhanyansh kaa hi khandan he
 Four categories have been considered for philosophy in philosophy - pramaan prameya pramiti pramaata
 Proof - Proof is that which has a definite knowledge of the subject and the determination of the subject
 prameya - pramaan ke dwaara jiskaa gyaan ho use prameya kehete hai
 Pramiti - Any subject that has definite knowledge through proof, is called pramiti
 pramaata - pramaan ke dwaara prameya gyaan ko jo jaanata he - use pramaata kehete hai
 Here various Indian philosophers have given a dual idea about knowledge - gyaan kaa pramanya swat: grahya he athwa parat: grahya he
 Mimansak, Vedanti and Buddhists come in the automatic category
 parat: koti main nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, jain or charvak aate hai
 Here, from the word 'authentic', one should understand the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, rather than the knowledge of the nature of knowledge
 chodanalakshanodharm: sutara main - "nanu atthabhootampyarth bruyat chodana" ityadi bhashya se arthtathatv hi vivakshit he
 "tchcha abadhitatvam, Arthanrutho dharma special :, tasya gyanen nirupranat"
 chaudnaa sutara ke bhashya "atathatv bhootan arth" se abaadhitiv arthnishth dharm vivakshit he, jiskaa nirupan gyaan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, pramanya is called jnanamanthi
 vah parat: utpann or parat: gruhit hota he
 This is the doctrine of barbarians
 arthath jis saamagree se gyaan utpann hota he, usase pramanya utpann na hokar anya saamagree se utpann hota he evam jisase gyaan grahit hota he, usase pramanya gruhit na hokar anya gun gyanadi se gruhit hota he
 From this it came to be that authenticity arises from material other than knowledgeable material and knowledge is authenticated by content other than customer content
 is mat main pramanya or apramanya donon parat: hote hai
 This is a routine consensus review
 uparyukt mat main mimasak log anavastha dosha bataate hai jisase gyaanamat pramanya kabhi siddh nahin ho saktaa
 That is, public behavior will be broken
 at: gyaanagat pramanya swat: utpann or swat: gruhit hota he
 The idea is that the content from which knowledge is produced, the same material also produces credibility; And the material with which knowledge is acquired, the same material is recognized
 yahi swat:pramanyawaadee mimaskadikon kaa pramanya kaa swatastv he, jiskaa kumaril bhatta ne apane granth bhatt vaarthik main anek yuktiyon se samarthan kiya he - Knowledge is permissible here in Bhattmat
 gyaan ke vishay main kuch atishay utpann hota he jisase "gyatoghat:" yah anubhav hota he
 From this, a religion called knownness arises in the subject of Ghatadi, which is called by the words Prakatyam, Bhasanam, Prakash
 isse yah aayaa ki gyatata lingak anumaan se gyaan kaa grahan hota he
 This is also the eclipse of authenticity
 prabhakar mat main gyaan swayan prakaash he
 Therefore, knowledge leads to enlightenment
 atev swat: pramanya donon maton main samaan he, jiskaa vivechan "shloke vaarthik", "prakaran panjika", "nyaay ratnamala" main vistrut rup se kiya gaya he
 The method of interpreting sentences of eternal meaning from direct inference is called method
 arthath agyatagyapak apravritapravartak jo vaakya hai uskaa naam "vidhi" he
 There are two sides of the mindset with respect to the pupil - one considers the propagation as the pupil
 isamen praayash: sabhi mimasak aa jate hai
 The second one considers the work to be complete
 yah prabhakar kaa siddhant he
 This side produces this type of - lok main pravartak purush, acharya athwa raja apane shishy athwa bhrity ko pravrutt karaane ke liye "gammanay" ityadi vaakya kaa prayog karte he
 a disciple or devotee, listening to the said sentence, researches its meaning
 pashchaat "gavaanayan" aadi kaary main pravrutt hota he
 Therefore, the motive of promoter man is special, it is called Vidhyarth in the world
 vah purush kii kriya he jo purush main rahati he
 Hence, it is also called Purushabhipraya
 veda apaurushey hone ke kaaran vaidic lingadi kaa arth purushabhipraay nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hence, the word Lingadi is used in place of a man
 uskaa vyaparvishesh hi vidhyarth he
 Being literate, it is also called Shabdi Bhavna
 iskaa lakshan is prakaar kiya gaya he "purushapravrityanukool: pravartak lingadinishtho vyaparvishesh: shabdi bhaavana"
 In the scriptures, it has been called the introduction, inspiration, etc
 lok main pravriti do prakaar kii hoti he - pratham apni ichha se purush pravrutt hota he
 The second promoter is the person, or person, by word, which is called "inspiration
" jahaan prerana ke pashchaat pravriti hoti he, vahaan pravartan gyaan hi pravartak mana jaataa he, jise mandan mishra, parthasarathi prabhruti vidwaanon ne "ishtsaadhan" mana he
 Justice Sudhakar has considered it to be a special supernatural religion
 prabhakar mishra ne pravriti ke prati kaaryatagyaan ko kaaran mana he, jisase ishtsaadhanatv aadi akshipt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, "chodna Sympto Religion:" is written in the sutra - "acharya Chodit" Karomi "while explaining this commentary, Shaliknath has said - Chodit: Promoted:, Karyambhavadh: Itartha, Karyagayana without Pravrittarasamvadhitti" Therefore Prabhakar is said in the opinion
 Is - "karya vidyarthi:, tachya karya dhatvarthatiabharatam, Apoorva word vachyam tadeva vidyartha eti" veda vaakyarth nirnay ke liye pravrutt mimasaa darshan main chaar prakaar kii vidhi kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he - Origin: The sentence by which the nature of karma is primarily known, is called genesis method
 udaahranarth "agnihotran juhoti" is vaakya se agnihotra naamak home se isht ko praapt karnaa arth hota he
 Appropriation method: The method by which the relation of the organ is known is known as appropriation
 udaahranarth "dadhna juhoti" is vaakya se dahi se havan karne kaa arth bodhit hota he
 It has Dadhi means and Home is practicable
 yahan viniyog vidhi main viniyog shabd se sambandh ko samajhnaa chahie
 That relationship ends in the practicable means, the angangi or the remaining
 prayogvidhi : jo pradhan or ang ke anushthan main kram kaa bodh karaata he use prayogvidhi kehete hai
 For example, heaven is attained by the Yajna, the principal worshiper of the Prayasadi organ
 isi abhipraay se lakshan kiya gaya he "angaanaan krambodhako vidhi; prayogvidhi:" Adhikavidhi: The method by which the karta of the karmajni fruit is regarded as the doer is called the Adhikavidhi
 udaahranarth "yajet swarg kaam:" yahan jo yagakarta he vahi swargfal kaa bhokta he
 In the same way, three types of methods are famous with distinction between Apoorva law, Rule method and Parvakhya method - upar vidhiyon ke do prakaar bataae gaye hai, use is prakaar samajhnaa chahie ki apurvavidhi main utpatti, viniyog prayog or adhikaar vidhi chaaron antargat hote hai
 Rule and number law is within the appropriation method itself
 is vishay kaa vishesh gyaan bhatt chintamani main drashtavy he
 Jhunku is a ward of the Deori tehsil of Sagar district, which is the largest ward of all the wards of Deori, in this ward, the agricultural produce market is located and from here originates the famous and ancient river Ramghat river which further meets the Sukhchen river

 Ravi Baswani was an actor in Hindi films
 ravi vaasavani ek film abhinayta he
 He has contributed a lot in Hindi films
 jane bhi do yaaron main unka kaam bahut saraahaa gaya tha
 An attempt has been made to understand the play through some characters
 jisame mukhya paatr ravi jisaki umr maatr 13 varsh he 
 And there is a grandpa, two women, a child and other characters are placed in the side role, who are only there to explain the whole drama
 paraayaa naatak kii shuruyaat It is at that time when Ravi, the main character of the play, went on a walk from home, on the way he saw two women talking and heard, savita boli – Anita quote - kya ? Savita Boli - wo jo mahendra kaa ladkaa tha wo adhikari banate hi ghar chhod ke chalaa gaya Anita quote - kya jamaana aa gaya jab apana hi nahi to wo to khayr paraayaa tha Savita Boli - sahi kah rahi ho anitha After hearing these things, Ravi moved forward and he saw two girls fighting who were saying 


 ek ladki bolti – This cloth is our cloth duusari ladkee bolti – That is my clothes or donon aapas main hi lard gayi kabhi ek ladki duusare ladki par chillaati to kabhi duusari pehle par jaise maano ek duusare ko maar daalegi 
 Seeing this Hamar and Tauhar, Ravi became very depressed and then he went on a walk ahead
 In the course of his journey, he reached the house of one of his relatives as soon as he reached a child and said - come to do Ho ? Ravi said - i kept walking like this
 phir wo saiyr kii kadi main aage ek vivaah main gaya jahaan usne kuch ghatnaaye dekhi or suni jiske baad usne nirnay kiya kii vah ye jaan kar rakhega kii ye paraayaa kya hota he ye shabd uske liye anjaanaa tha wo samaj nahi paa rahaa tha kii kya kare vivaah atend karne ke baad wo ghar kii ore laut rahaa tha kii raste main uski nazar ek vriksh ke paas baithe ek dadaji par padi ravi ko aabhaar ho gaya kii uske prashno kaa uttar dadaji ke paas jarur mil jaayegaa ravi ne tanik bhi der nahi kiya jhat se us dadaji ke paas pahucha gaya
 Ravi said using the words of respect - Dada ji, there is an idea in my mind, can you explain to me what it means? Grandpa did not hesitate at all dadaji turant bolaa - Say yes son! ravi bolaa - What is this alien? dadaji mujhe dhyaan se dekhne lage jaise maano wo hamase ye kahana chaah rahe ho kii itane chote bachche ke dimag main ye baat aayin kaise or kyon Grandpa said - kisne tumse ye baat kahi betaa ? In the same way, there are many more
 ravi bolaa - People often hear their own and foreign words
 Grandpa said - tumne koi to aisa vaakia jarur dekha hoga jise dekh tumhe laga ho kii tumhe paraayaa kya he ye jaan lenaa chahie ? In the same way, there are many more
 ravi bolaa – In the same way, there are many more
 dadaji bole - If she had to clash with each other for something, what about her alien? Ravi said - mujhe laga kii shaayad isi ko paraayaa kehete ho Grandpa said - or koi vaakia jaanate ho to bataao jo dekh tumhe laga kii tumhe paraayaa jaananaa chahie ? In the same way, there are many more
 ravi bolaa - Apart from this, once i went to someone's house, it was the house of some of my relatives who were now living separately
 As soon as i reached there, a small child came to me and asked slowly - what have you come to do? maine uttar diya - Are such questions called alien? Grandpa said - ise bhi paraayaa nahi kehete wo to tumhaare aane kaa kaaran puch rahaa tha wo to chota sa baccha tha usase isse kya lenaa dena
 or koi vaakia jaanate ho to bataao? In the same way, there are many more
 ravi bolaa - i remember an incident even more when i went to a wedding at someone's house, i saw the whole house was decorated on the bride's side
 mere ek mitra kii bahan kii shaadi thi main bhi bahut khush tha mujhe yaad he aaj bhi wo manoram din kahu yaa use kaali raat kahu jab apana kehanaale vaala sambandhi us bahan kii shaadi bich main hi chhod kar chalaa gaya jaise maano kisi kii shaadi atend karne aaye wo bhojan kiye or chal die iske alaava bhi bahut si ghatnaaye ghati 
 Is it alien? dadaji bole – Ravi said - dadaji bole – Ravi said - ek mahila dusre ko bataa rahi thi kii wo to uskaa sagaa ladkaa nahi isliye chhod kar chalaa gaya 

 Grandpa said - betaa teri baaten sunaqar to meri aankhe bhar aayin i do not think that anyone who has seen so much now needs to tell me the word alien, yet i am telling you

 a hieroglyph is called a script that has expressions that convey meaning rather than alphabets that express sound
 yah bhavchitra aise chitralekh chihn hote hai jo koi vichaar yaa avadharana vyakt karen
 Some expressions are such that they represent something that even a person unfamiliar with that image can recognize its meaning, such as the चिह्न sign in the Unicode for 'umbrella' which can be identified by anyone who has seen an umbrella
 iske vipareet kuch bhavchitron kaa arth keval unase parichit vyakti hi pahchaan pate hai, masalan '' kaa chihn 'ishwar' yaa 'dharm' kii avadharana vyakt karata he or '6' kaa chihn chah kii sankhya kii avadharana vyakt karata he
 The Chinese script and the ancient Egyptian script are examples of such hieroglyphs
 "bhavchitron" ko angrezi main "idiogram" yaa "idiograph" kehete hai
 "hieroglyphs" are called "idiographic scripts" or "pictographic scripts" in English
 jo lipi aksharmala par aadhaarit hoti he usamen pathak ko keval kuch dhvaniyon ke liye chihn hi seekhney hote hai
 After adding these signs, the reader can read all the words in that language
 agar koi nayaa yaa aparichit shabd ho to uske akshar pard kar pathak use uccharit kar saktaa he
 In hieroglyphs, readers sometimes read hundreds or thousands of symbols to learn
 chini bhashaa seekhney ke liye yah zaruri he
 Nevertheless, hieroglyphs have a major advantage
 nepali or hindi donon main aksharmala par aadhaarit devanagari lipi prayog hoti he
 If a Hindi speaker sees the word 'atuva' in Nepali language, he can pronounce it but cannot understand that it means 'ginger'
 iske vipareet chini or bhashaa main prayog hone vaale 猫 chihn ko dekhakar chinibhashi or japanibhashi donon 'billi' kaa arth praapt karte hai lekin isko apni-apni bhashaaon main bilkul bhinn prakaar se bolte hai
 In Japanese it is read 'neko' and in Mandarin Chinese it is read 'mao'
 japan ke bahut se log chini kaa bina ek bhi shabd jane chini akhbaar padhakar us se kaafii arth nikalne main sakasham hai
 If they read the same newspaper in Chinese, they do not understand anything
 yah usee tarah kii baat he jaise ☂ kaa chihn dekhakar hindibhashi 'chhatari' kahegaa, angrezibhaashi 'ambralla' kahegaa or francisibhaashi 'paraplui' kahegaa
 For this reason, Chinese-speaking people are often able to understand them to some extent by seeing thousands of years old inscriptions found in China, because many images have been going on for a long time with slight alterations
 haalanki chini lipi main bhavchitron kaa prayog hota he, phir bhi bahut se shabdon ko in bhavchitron se sambandhit dhvaniyon ko jodakar likhaa jaataa he
 Often in words, a graphic gives some sense of meaning and another is helpful in making sounds
 isliye chini lipi vastav main chitralipi or dhwani-aadhaarit lipi kaa ek mishrit rup he
 For example, in Chinese चीनी is pronounced 'chong' and it means 'strong current or wave of water'
 iske baayein main teen choti lakeeren hai jinka arth "pani" hota he
 It is also found in other words related to water, such as 河, 河 and 流
 chong ke baayein main to yah pani kaa bhavchitra he lekin uske daayen main 中 kaa chinh he jiskaa arth 'bich' he or jiskaa uccharan 'jong' kiya jaataa he
 When these two expressions are written together, पाठक is indicated to the reader that look for the sign on the left for the meaning and the right for the sound
 to pathak samaj jaataa he ki yah pani se sambandhit shabd he jiskaa uccharan 'jong' se miltaa-julata hoga
 With this, he realizes that the word is 'chong'
 gaur kijiye ki daayen taraf ke jong shabd kaa arth bilkul nahin prayog hota or baayein taraf ke pani se sambandhit shabd kii dhwani bilkul nahin prayog hoti

 The Fujita scale or the Fujita – Pearson scale is a rating scale of the power measurement of tornadoes
 iskaa aadhaar maanav nirmit sanrachanaon va vanaspati ko hui kshati kii jaanch he
 The official category of the Fujita scale is assessed by meteorologists and engineers after studying many facts such as ground and aerial surveys and the whirlwind of the tornado on the earth according to the circumstances, the information received by the radar, interviews of eyewitnesses, the news of the media and the stability of the damage And video pictures etc
 is paimaane kaa avishkaar 1971 main chicago vishvavidhyalay ke vaigyanik tetsuya phujita ne kiya tha
 His colleagues in this work were Alan Pearson, president of the National Saver Storms Forecast Center
 In 1973, this invention also added the properties of knowing the length and breadth of the storm route
 1973 ke baad america main aaye sabhi bavandaron par turant is paimaane se reating lagaai jaati he
 Also, post-incident ratings of the tornadoes that came in between 1950 and 1972 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Tornado Database were also done on this scale

 The Fujita scale is used everywhere except in the UK until 2007
 2007 main ise unnat karke nae anhansed phujita scale kaa anaavaran kiya gaya
 Although the main cause of damage is wind speed, the Fujita scale is a scale for measuring damage with less attention to wind
 anhansed phujita paimaane kii zarurat isliye padi kyonki anusandhanvidon ne paaya ki jin hawa kii gati ke aankadon par kshati jaanchane kaa aadhaar kendrit tha vah urdhv anumaanit the
 After further research, scientists established these new motion figures based on the enhanced Fujita scale

 The EF scale also significantly improved the description of damage
 phujita dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya mul paimaana beufort va mike scale ko achche dhang se jodne ke liye tha
 It had thirteen levels from F0 to F12

 According to Fujita, 6 levels were enough from F0 to F5 and could include all speed ranges and damage ranges
 unhone haalanki ek 'F6' str bhi khulaa chhod rakhaa tha, ek achintaneey bavandar tathaa usase sambanddh achintaneey kshati ke liye
 Also, the standard of wind speed has been found to be incorrect in earlier speed-damage Dwijs figures

 Winds of different speeds can also cause the same damage at different places and buildings

 "since then the EF scale with excellent wind-speed figures has come into play
 kuch sroton ne ek F+ str jod diya he
 This means the wind speed is less than 39 meters per hour, where on some special occasions the effect of the wind is on a wide area

 Property damage cannot be more than total damage and this is what happens in the F5 tornado

 But till date the measurement could not be done and this data has also not been obtained at the bottom of Jamil
 mausam vigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye phujita paimaane kii reating ko claason main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 The Fujita scale, introduced in 1971, estimated damage based on wind speed data
 yah ek shikshit anumaan se adhik kuch nahin tha
 Fujita and others soon realized this and in the 1970s more intensive studies were done on it
 isse paata chalaa ki jaisaa epa paimaane ne bataaya tha, usase kahin kam vaayu gati kahin adhik kshati kar sakati he
 Although this scale estimates wind damage, it did not include the excellence or inadequacy of construction
 kisi building main adham nirmaan ke kaaran kam vaayu gati main bhi adhik kshati sambhav he
 Fujita tried to clear up these doubts in 1992, but by then he had reached half-retirement, and the National Weather Service was not in a position to adopt this task, and therefore remained unfinished
 america va anya deshon ne 1 farvari 2007 main phujita scale tyaag kar anhansed phujita scale apana liya
 This was a series of advancements on the original Fujita scale, such as the variation of damage in different structures
 Newly expanded and refined damage figures and ranges are now a fixed standard, previously unclear
 yah nayaa paimaane vaayu gat ke bhi adhik sateek anumaan praapt he tathaa saath hi EF5 ke liye koi upree vaayu gati seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he
 Many countries, such as Canada and France, however still use the original Fujita scale

 It is the process by which the absorption and emission of infrared radiation into the atmosphere by hot gases is reduced to another planet's surface in the atmosphere
 greenhouse prabhaav ke rup main astitv is prakaar vivaadit nahin he
 Naturally possessing greenhouse gases means a heat effect of about 33 ° C, which will not be habitable on Earth

 Human activity has increased since the Industrial Revolution, which has led to a significant increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, which has also led to greatly increased diffuse bound CO 2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC and s nitrous
 Methane is more effective than greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but its concentration is so low that its radiative strength is only one f, compared to carbon dioxide
 Some other gases that are naturally occurring contribute to the greenhouse effect

 There is a possibility of higher CO2 levels in the future as there is a lot of change in fossil fuels and land use
 The rate of increase will depend on uncertain economic, social, technological and natural phenomena but perhaps the availability of fossil fuels will ultimately prove to be the deciding factor
 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios of the World tells of several future CO2 scenarios that last from the end of 2100 to 541 to 970 P

 The effects of climate factors on climate are complicated by various processes

 Whether the net effect is hot or cold depends on details like cloud type and height
 jalwaayu ke pratimaanon par in vivaranon ko pradarshit karnaa kathin hota he kyonki jalwaayu pratimaanon ke sanganak khaanon par rikt sthanon ke binduon ke bich kii tulana main badal bahut chote hote hai
 As the atmosphere gets warmer, the advisory response process is related to the change in the lapse rate
 kshobhamandal unchai main badhotari hone ke saath-saath vayumandal kaa taapmaana ghatata jaataa he
 The emission of infrared radiation depends on the fourth power of temperature, longer radiation is emitted from the top layer of the atmosphere and less than the lower layer
 zyaadaatar vikiran jo upari vaataavaran se utsarjit hoti he khala main chali jaati he, jabaki nichle vaataavaran se utsarjit hone vaali vikiran dobaaraa vatavarav dwaara sokh lee jaati he
 Thus, the greenhouse effect depends on the speed at which the temperature in the atmosphere decreases with elevation, if the temperature rate is low then the greenhouse effect will be higher and if the rate of temperature fall is low then the greenhouse effect will be less
 siddhant or model donon yah sanket karte hai ki varming se oonchai ke saath taapmaana kaa girnaa kam ho jayega, jisase ek nakaaratmak lapse rate feedback paidaa ho jayega or isse green house asar kamazor hoga
 The measurement of the rate of temperature change with altitude is very sensitive to small errors, which makes it very difficult to find whether the model matches the reality

 Two researchers from Duke University, Bruce West and Nicola Scafetta have estimated that the sun contributed to a temperature increase of perhaps 45–50 percent by 1900–2000, and raised temperatures by about 25–35 percent between 1980 and 2000

 The land in the northern hemisphere is more jiada, so it heats up faster than the southern hemisphere
 Seasonal ice and sea in the northern hemisphere There are extensive areas of ice that depend on ice-albedo feedback in the northern hemisphere, more than in the southern hemisphere
 Green house gases are emitted, but it is not responsible for the difference in heat as the major greenhouse gases stay for a long time and mix well in both hemispheres

 Surrey modern climate models are an abstract model in itself
 And this is different with the model of the sea and the model of ice on land and sea
 In some models chemical and biological Treatments of processes are also involved
 This model finds that if the effect of greenhouse gases is added, a warmer climate is attained
 Nevertheless, even when this assumption is used, climate sensitivity still has a large role

 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Rai was a presenter of not only chemistry in India but also modern science

 Dr
 Prafulla Chandra Rai was born on 2 August 1861 in a village named Ruruli Katipara in Khulna district of Bengal

 When you opposed this injustice to the then English director of the Education Department, he satirized that "if you are such a qualified chemist, why not run a business?" The effect of these sharp words was that Rai later started the work of Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Curves in 1892 with a small capital of 800 rupees, in his living room, to prepare luxurious medicines
 Tax has become a factory worth crores of rupees today and has led to the introduction of other such industries in the country
