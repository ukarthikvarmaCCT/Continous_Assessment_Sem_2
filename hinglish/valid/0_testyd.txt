 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries

 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 manusmriti hindu dharm kaa ek pracheen dharamshastra he
 It is also known by the names Manav dharma-shastra, Manushahita etc
 yah upadesh ke rup main he jo manu dwaara rishiyon ko diya gaya
 Subsequent theologians have followed Manusmriti as a reference
 dharamshastreey granthkaaron ke atirikt shankaracharya, shabaraswami jaise darshanik bhi pramanroopen is granth ko uddhrut karte hai
 Traditionally, this memory is composed by Swayambhuva Manu and not by Vaivasvata Manu or Orienas Manu
 manusmriti se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki swyambhuv manu ke mulashastra kaa aashray kar bhrigu ne us smriti kaa upavrihan kiya tha, jo prachlit manusmriti ke naam se prasiddh he
 Like this 'bhargaviya Manusmriti', 'nardiya Manusmriti' is also popular
 manusmriti vah dharamshastra he jisaki manyata jagavikhyath he
 Decisions have been made on the basis of its evidence not only in India but also in foreign countries and even today
 atah dharamshastra ke rup main manusmriti ko vishwa kii amuly nidhi mana jaataa he
 After the Vedas in India, 'manusmriti' is the most recognized and practiced
 isamen chaaron varnon, chaaron ashramon, solah sanskaron tathaa sristi utpatti ke atirikt rajya kii vyavastha, raja ke kartavya, bhaanti-bhaanti ke vivaadon, sena kaa prabandh aadi un sabhi vishyon par paraamarsh diya gaya he jo ki maanav maatr ke jivan main ghatit hone sambhav he
 All this religious system is based on the Veda
 manu maharaj ke jivan or unke rachanakaal ke vishay main itihaas-puraana spasht nahin hai
 However, everyone accepts with one voice that Manu was a primitive man and this scripture is his scripture
 ‘manusmriti’ bhartiya samskruti kaa abhinn ang he
 It is counted in such texts of the world, from which humans have gained inspiration for personal behavior and society
 isamen prashn keval dharmik aasthaa yaa vishwaas kaa nahin he
 Every social person has this expectation and aspiration to meet the needs of human life, in any way, by mutual cooperation and in an elegant way

 Only an official scholar can do this after comparative studies
 antoni read kehete hai ki burma, thailand, cambodia, java-bali aadi main dharamshastron or pramukhtah manusmriti, kaa bada aadar tha
 In these countries, these texts were considered to be natural laws and the kings were expected to conduct themselves accordingly
 in granthon kaa pratilipikaran kiya gaya, anuwaad kiya gaya or sthaneey kanoonon main inako sammilit kar liya gaya
 a book memorial called 'bible in India' Louis Jacquilot writes: manusmriti ke kaal evam praneta ke vishay main naveen anusandhankaree vidwaanon ne paryaapt vichaar kiya he
 Some people believe that this memory was named Manusmriti, because it was active in the "human" stage
 koi kehete hai ki manusmriti se pehle koi 'maanav dharmasutra' tha jiskaa aashray lekar kisi ne ek mul manusmriti banaai thi jo baad main upbrunhit hokar vartmaan rup main prachlit ho gai
 Many answers of Manusmriti are considered even when considering for them many of the ideas or sentences which are not found in ancient texts like Nirukta, Mahabharata etc
 is prakaar ke anek tathyon kaa boohaler, pandurang vaaman kane aadi vidwaanon ne paryaapt vivechan kiya he
 It seems quite logical that the theological sentences with the name of Manu were prevalent in the society, whose instructions are in the Mahabharata etc
 and the words of which the present Manushahita was taken by taking shelter, as well as the name of an ancient sage named Bhrigu for fame
 Added to it
 manu se pehle bhi dharamshastrakaar the, yah manu ke "ete" aadi shabdon se hi gyaat hua he

 In India, monuments of national importance are historical, ancient or archaeological structures, sites or places located in India, which, under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, through the Archaeological Survey of India, the Federal Government of India or State governments are protected by them

 There has been no concrete discussion about the poetry of prithviraj-raso till date, only the historicity of Raso was discussed
 raso ke samyak kaavyatmak moolyankan ke liye hamen nimna sheershakon par vichaar karnaa hoga
 If we abandon the historical point of view and evaluate the memory of Raso from the point of view of poetry, then we have to accept the importance of the imagination of the poet
 
jin prasangon kii udbhaavna ko lekar itihaaskaar raso par chhintakashi karte hai ,vastutah ve hi kavi kii kavy -kushalta ke parichaayak hai
 Prithviraj and Jaychand's opposition may not have been the cause of the abduction of Samyukta, but the poet has found a beautiful context for Rasraj's expression
 yudhon ke kaaran ke rup main kisi prem prasang kii kalpana karke unhen vishuddh dwesh kii abhivyakti hone se bachaa liya gaya he
 Even if Prithviraj is repeatedly forgiven, it is not a historical fact, but due to this the effect of generosity of the character of the hero is reflected in the heart of the readers
 jab gori is chhamadaan kaa badla prithviraj ko louh -shrunkhalaaon main jakad kar chukaata he ,to pathak kii aatma tilamila uthati he or uski sari sahanubhuti vijeta gori ke saath na rah kar parajeet prithviraj ke saath ho jaati he
 Likewise, Prithviraj's word Vedhi Baan's surrender to Ghori by sacrificing his white self elevates the character of the hero, which is necessary for the Indian epic tradition
 he
 The author of Raso has introduced the poet-heart in the description of city, park, forest, lake, fort, army, war etc
 yuddh kshetra kaa pratyaksh chithran: Here only the static view is marked, but there is also no lack of dynamic pictures in Raso: yahan yuddh kaa drushtigochar rup hi nahin ,uskaa shrutigochar rup bhi spasht ho jaataa he : In Raso, the heroic and shringar rasa has been arranged in context
 vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah kii abhivyakti ospurn style main kii gai he
 As: isi prakaar shringaar ras ke aalamban—padmavati ke soundarya chithran main maadhurya purna style kaa prayog hua he: Here the poet is not satisfied with the heroine Chandra being equipped with sixteen arts, but in childhood, the imagination of the moon sitting near this lunar eclipse has increased its importance even more
 nayika ke vibhinn angon ke sanghathan ke liye vidhi ko na keval vibhinn upaadaanon ko ekatrit karnaa padaa ,apitu use ek khaas saanche kaa bhi prayog karnaa padaa
 Mahakavi Chand has also described other parts of Shringar Ras - Vay, Sandhi, Yauvanagam, Anurag, first union coincidental shame, etc
 with full immersion
 sanyogkalin cheshtaaon ke nirupan main unhone jaisi safalataa praapt kii he ,waisi hi unhone viyoganubhatiyon kii abhivyakti main kii he
 An example is sight; yahan "badi viyog bahu bal" kii aavriti is dhang se kii gai he ki usase viyoganubhatiyon kii kramik vruddhi kaa bodh swatah hi ho jaataa he
 The increase of the separation in the last line has been compared to the shame of the total bride on the day of climbing
 ek sookshm bhav kii tulana anya sookshm bhav se karke kavi ne apni paini drushti kaa parichay diya he
 Similarly, despite the existence of all the pleasures, how does his taste change in disconnection, hear the experience from the face of the heroine of the poet
 "ve hi mahal hai ,ve hi yoginipur hai,ve hi sahchariyon ke jhund hai ,kintu ek priy pati ke sanyog ke abhaav main mujhe kuch bhi acha nahin lagata
 "apart from Veer and Shringar Ras, other juices have also been expressed in the context of Raso
 visheshtah hasya ,bhayanak or raudra kaa chithran to sthaan -sthaan par hua "why did the poor, frivolous body and animal living in the forest extent become lean?" Chandbardai replied in a sarcastic manner - is chand kaa taatpary yah he ki maharaja prithviraj ke bhay se unke shatruon ne ite trin munh main liye ki bechaare barad ke khaane ke liye kuch nahin bachaa
 In such a situation it is natural for him to get lean
 kahana na hoga ki kavi ne is manoranjak prasang kii udbhaavna karke hasya kaa nirupan safaltaapurvak kar diya he
 In fact, there is a vision of a great poet-like talent everywhere in Rasocar
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai kii bhavabhivyakti kii drushti se prithviraj raso ek praudh rachana he
 From the point of view of art, the use of ornaments, the language of speech, variety of verses etc
 are also found in it
 bhashaa kii ekarupata kaa abhaav usamen avashya he,kintu dosha itnaa bada nahin he ki vah uske mahatv ko nune kar de
 Some lacks are going to knock in the rasa
 ek to kavi ne vir ras ke mul bhav ko vyaktigat raag -dwesh par hi aadhaarit kiya he
 , So it could not get the generality of the epic
 us samay raashtra ko jaateey sanghathan or ekta kii badi aavashyaktaa thi ,kavi kaa kaam hota he ki apane yug ke vaataavaran se upar uth kar bhavishya ke liye koi sandesh de ,kintu rasokar aisa nahin kar paaya
 In the same way, the seriousness of love sentiment could not be found in Shringar Rasa, it cannot be expected from the feudatories who are constantly creating new marriages
 kavi ne bhi samantvaadi drushtikon apanaate hui nari ko maatr bhoga kii hi vastu maatr mana he; vah uske hriday ke sookshm soundarya ke darshan nahin kar sakaa
 Despite all these defects, Prithviraj Raso is an epic
 vanonmulan kaa arth he wanon ke kshetron main pedon ko jalaana yaa kaatna aisa karne ke liye kai kaaran hai; pedon or unase vyutpann charcol ko ek vastu ke rup main bechaa ja saktaa he or manushya ke dwaara upyog main liya ja saktaa he jabaki saafe kii gayi bhoomi ko charaagaah yaa maanav awaas ke rup main kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 Such cutting and re-planting of trees has resulted in damage to habitat, loss of biodiversity and increased dryness in the atmosphere
 saath hi aksar jin kshetron se pedon ko hataa diya jaataa he ve banjar bhoomi main badal jate hai
 Lack of awareness or disregard for intrinsic values, lack of responsive values, loose forest management and environmental laws allow deforestation on such a large scale
 kai deshon main vanonmulan nirantar kii jaati he jiske parinamswaroop vilopan, jalwaayu main parivartan, marusthalikaran or swadeshi logon ke visthaapan jaisi prakriyaayein dekhne main aati hai
 In simple words, deforestation occurs because forest land is not economically viable
 kheti ke liye bhoomi kii maatra ko badhane ke saath saath kashtha kaa upyog puure vishwa main 20 karod se adhik logon ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The estimated value of forests as a genetic resource has not been confirmed by any economic studies
 iske parinaam swarup van bhoomi ke maalik wanon kii safai nahin karne se nuksaan uthaate hai or yah puure samaaj ke kalyaan ko prabhavit karata he
 From the perspective of the developing world, the benefits of biodiverse sources and forests in the form of carbon sinks extend primarily to developed and wealthy nations and are not adequately compensated for these services
 jiske parinaam swarup kuch deshon ke paas bahut adhik van hai, vikasshil desh mahasoos karte hai ki viksit duniya main kuch desh jaise sanyukt rajya america, ne apane jangalon ko sadiyon pehle kaata or isse bahut adhik laabh uthaaya or vikaas sheel deshon ke liye samaan avasaron kaa khandan karnaa galat hoga
 That is, the poor people cannot even bear the cost of their protection, while the rich created this problem
 ek saamaanya samjhaute ke alawa ki vanonmulan bhoomi ke aarthik mulya ko badhaati he, is baat par koi samjhauta nahin he ki vanonmulan ke kya kaaran hai
 In some areas deforestation can be a direct source of wood and in some areas it may be an indirect source such as deforestation for the road to farmers who want to go for cleaning the forests: experts do not agree that wood For this, the cutting of trees contributes significantly to world-class deforestation
 or kuch kaa maananaa he ki lakdi ko kaatna vanonmulan ko kam karne main mukhya yogadan detaa he kyonki vikaas sheel deshon main lakdi ke bhandar prakritik sroton kii tulana main kahin zyada hote hai
 Similarly, there is no consensus on the fact that poverty is important in deforestation
 kuch logon kaa tark he ki garib log lakdi kaatane ko praathamikta dete hai kyon ki unke paas koi or vikalp nahin he
 Others believe that poor people do not have the necessary materials to clean forests and the ability to pay for labor
 jansankhya vruddhi vanonmulan ko badhaava detii he, is prakaar ke daawey kamjor hai or truti yukt aankadon par aadhaarit hai, jansankhya vruddhi ke saath vanonmulan kaa praathmik rup se badhanaa keval 8 pratishat maamalon main hi paaya jaataa he
 According to the FAO, the world-class deforestation rate is not related to data on the growth rate of human population, but is a result of lack of technological progress and inefficient governance
 There are many reasons at the root of deforestation, such as corruption and unequal wealth and capacity
 Distribution, population growth and overpopulation, and urbanization
 Globalization is often seen as a factor promoting deforestation
 britain ke paryaavaran vigyaani norman myrs ke anusaar 5 pratishat vanonmulan kaa kaaran he pashuon ke dwaara charaai, 19 pratishat vanonmulan lakdi ke liye kaate jane ke kaaran hoti he, 22 pratishat kaa kaaran he badhate hue tad ke tel ke liye vriksharopan or 54 pratishat kaa kaaran he slesh and bern prakaar kii kheti
 It is very difficult to obtain data on the rate of deforestation, if not impossible
 The FAO figures are largely based on the reports of forest divisions of different countries

 The water cycle is also affected by deforestation
 ped apni jadon ke madhyam se bhoojal avashoshit karte hai or vaataavaran main mukt kar dete hai
 When a part of the forest is removed, the trees do not evaporate this water and as a result the atmosphere becomes dry

 Deforestation reduces soil fertility so that erosion, flooding, and landslides are fixed
 Forests promote recirculation of aquifers in some places, however, in most places forests are the main source of aquifer reduction

 Most estimates of forestry-related biodiversity are based on species area samples, with an implicit assumption that as forests decrease, species diversity will also decrease
 However, many such specimens have been shown to be inaccurate and habitat loss is not necessarily responsible for large-scale species damage
