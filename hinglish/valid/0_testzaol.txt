 The responsibility of managing and operating the new paper currency was entrusted to the Presidency Banks and the Government of India took the responsibility of transferring deposits in the treasury to the banks where the banks would open their branches
 tab tak teenon presidency bainkon kii koi shakha nahin thi jabaki unke samvidhan ke antargat unhen yah adhikaar praapt tha
 But as soon as the three presidency banks got assurance of using the deposits in the treasury without interruption, they started to open branches of the bank at those places rapidly

 With the formation of the Reserve Bank of India as the central bank of India in 1935, the role of the semi-central bank of the Imperial Bank came to an end
 imperial bank bharat sarkaar kaa bank na rahakar aise kendron main jahaan kendriya bank nahin he, sarkari vyavsaay ke nishpaadan ke liye bhartiya reserve bank kaa agent ban gaya
 But it continued to operate the depots of currency chests and small coins and to operate the Remittance Facility Scheme for other banks and the public on the terms set by the Reserve Bank of India

 The Imperial Bank has recorded very impressive growth in the form of offices, reserves, deposits, investments and advances during the three and a half decades since its existence
 kuch maamalon main yah vruddhi chah guna se bhi adhik rahi
 The financial position and security inherited from the predecessors unambiguously provided the bank a solid and robust platform

 Due to all this, Imperial Bank attained a very special position in the Indian banking industry and also gained an important place in the economic life of the country

 varsh 1951 main jab pratham panchavashiya yojana shuru hui to desh ke gramin kshetra ke vikaas ko isamen sarvocch praathamikta di gai
 Till then, the commercial banks of the country, including the Imperial Bank of India, were confined to the urban sector and were not fully prepared to meet the future requirements of economic reconstruction of rural areas

 Later, in 1959 the State Bank of India Act was passed which resulted in the State Bank of India acquiring eight associate banks of the erstwhile states as subsidiaries, thus leading to the emergence of the State Bank of India with a new obligation of social purpose

 Its publisher, John Chapman, introduced him to his seminar, which included many of the capital's most democratic and progressive thinkers, including John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, George Henry Lewis and Mary Ann Evans, with whom he had a brief romantic engagement

 Spencer's next book, Principles of Psychology, published in 1855, discovered a physiological basis for psychology, his first reward from Evans and Lewis
 yah pustak in buniyadi manyataon par aadhaarit thi ki maanav man prakritik niyamon ke anusaar kaary karata he tathaa yah ki inhen saamaanya jeev-vigyaan ke dhaanche ke bheetar khoja ja saktaa tha
 This allowed an evolutionary approach to be adopted not only in terms of the individual, but also in terms of species and race
 Through this paradigm, Spencer's goal was Mill's logic's associative psychology, the notion that the human-mind was formed from molecular sensations held together by laws of associative thought, and that more 'scientific' seeming cranial science The theory, in which the core of specific mental functions was traced to different parts of the brain, was to reconcile
 spencer ne tark diya ki, ye donon siddhant satya kaa aanshik varnan karte the: vichaaron ke doharaavpurn saahchary mastishk ke utakon main vishisht reshon ke nirmaan main sammilit the, tathaa inhen prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke madhyam se ek se duusari peedi main bheja ja saktaa tha
 He humbly believed that psychology would do the same thing for the human mind as Isaac Newton did for matter
 haalanki, yah pustak prarambh main safal nahin thi or iske pratham sanskaran kii antim 251 pratiyaan june 1861 tak nahin bik sakin
 Spencer's interest in psychology was derived from a more basic concern establishing the universality of natural law

 This was in contrast to the views of many theologians at the time, who insisted that parts of the composition, particularly the human soul, were outside the domain of scientific research
 comte kii sistim di philosophy positive prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ko pradarshit karne ke lakshya se likhi gai thi or apane lakshya kii purti ke liye spencer ko comte kaa anusaran karnaa tha
 However, Spencer did not agree with Comte's belief that it was possible to find a rule of universal application, which he discovered in progressive development and called the theory of evolution
 san 1858 main, spencer ne ek ruparekha taiyaar kii, jo baad main kritrim darshanashasre kii pranali bani

 Spencer thought that this composition of ten sections would take twenty years to complete; In the end it took him twice as long and it took almost the entire duration of his long life

 By the 1890s, his readers began to abandon him and many of his closest friends died and his mind was skeptical about the confident devotion to development that he had made his philosophical system central

 Although social statics was originally a creation of a democrat who believed in giving women the right to vote and in the nationalization of land to break the power of feudalism, by the 1880s, they were staunch women sufferers
 Had become adversaries and he collaborated with the Liberty and Property Defense League land owners in a common program against him Received, which they believe leaning toward "socialism" elements led by William Ewart Gladstone was largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself
 Spencer's political views of this period were expressed in The Man Versus the State, which has become his best work

 In 1902, shortly before his death, Spencer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature
 He continued his lifelong writing, often through dictation in the last years of his life, until he was overcome with illness at the age of 83

 Spencer's philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it was possible to believe in humanity's ultimate perfection based on advanced scientific concepts, such as the first law of thermodynamics and biological origins
 sankshep main, spencer kaa darshanik drushtikon devvaad or pratyakshvaad ke ek sangyojan se milakar bana tha
 On the one hand, he inherited some portions of eighteenth-century Devism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society, and from books such as George Combe's highly popular The Constitution of Man
 isamen vishwa ko sadbhaavpurn rachana vaala ek brahmad or prakruti ke niyamon ko ‘bhavathit rup se dayaalu’ mana gaya tha
 Natural laws were thus statues of the well-known universe, which were created by the Creator for the purpose of propagating human happiness
 haalanki spencer ne kishoravastha main hi apane isai mat kaa tyaag kar diya tha or baad main devatv kii kisi bhi ‘maanavarupi’ avadharana ko asweekaar kar diya, lekin iske baavjood ek lagbhag avchetan str par ve is avadharana ko dridhtaapurvak jakade hue the
 Although he owed much of the credit he gave to positivism, he had received much from it, especially in its creation of a philosophical system as the integration of various branches of scientific knowledge
 He was also following positivism in his insistence that it is possible to get only the real knowledge of facts and hence it was futile to speculate about the nature of the final truth
 pratyakshvaad or unke shesh devvaad ke bich yah tanaav kritrim darshanashasre kii puri pranali main bana rahaa
 Spencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; In this sense, his philosophy was focused on being 'artificial'
 comte kii hi tarah, ve bhi prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ke prati patibaddh the, jiske anusaar prakruti ke niyam bina kisi apwaad ke jaivik kshetra par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne kii ajaev kshetra par or maanav ke man par bhi utane hi lagu hote hai, jitne ki shesh sristi par
 is prakaar kritrim darshanashasre kaa pehla uddeshy yah pradarshit karnaa tha ki prakritik niyamon ke rup main, brahmad ke sabhi tathyon ke vaigyanik anveshan ko khoj paane main sakasham hone ke liye koi bhi apwaad nahin he
 All of Spencer's works on biology, psychology, and sociology were intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific areas
 yahaan tak ki naitikta par unke lekhan main bhi, unhone yah vichaar rakhaa ki nashvarata ke 'niyamon' ko khoj paanaa sambhav tha, jinamein niyamaatmak saamagree hone ke baavjood bhi jinaki avasthaa prakruti ke niyamon kii hi thi, yah ek aisi avadharana he, jiskaa mul combay ke constitution of main main dekha ja saktaa he
 The second purpose of Artificial Philosophy was to show that these same rules lead to development in a sustained way
 keval vaigyanik vidhi kii ekta par bal dene vaale comte ke vipareet, spencer ne sabhi prakritik niyamon ko ek buniyadi niyam, utpatti ke niyam, main vighatit karke vaigyanik gyaan ke ekikaran kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, he followed the paradigm proposed by Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous work Vestiges of Natural History of Creation
 haalanki aksar ise charles darwin kii da origin of spisis kaa ek prabhaavaheen agradoot kahkar khaarij kar diya jaataa he, lekin vastav main chembers kii pustak vigyaan ke ekikaran ke liye ek kaarykram thi, jiskaa lakshya yah darshana tha ki saura mandal kii utpatti ke liye laplas kii niharika pariklpana or lemark kaa prajati roopantaran kaa siddhant donon hi 'pragatisheel vikaas kaa ek adbhut samanyikaran' ke udhaaharan the
 Chambers was associated with Chapman's seminar and his work became an undisclosed mold for artificial philosophy
 spencer ke vikasvaadi drushtikon kii spasht abhivyakti pehali baar unke niabandh, 'progress: its lau and coz ' main hui, jo ki san 1857 main chapman ke westominster rivyuu main prakashit hua tha or jo baad main first principles of a new system of philasophy kaa aadhaar bana

 Spencer expressed the view that all the structures of the universe evolve from a simple, uniform, symmetry into a complex, different, variety and the process of large integration of different parts continues with it
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki yah vikasvaadi prakriya puure brahmad main kaary karti hui dekhi ja sakati he
 It was a universal law, which was as much applicable to stars and galaxies, as much to biological beings and to the human social system as it was to the human mind
 It differed from scientific rules only by its general generality, and special science rules could be demonstrated as examples of this theory
 jatilta ke vikaas kii vyakhya karne kaa yah prayaas do varshon baad prakashit hui darwin kii origin of spisis main milane vaale prayaas se purnatah bhinn tha
 Quite often, incorrectly, it is believed that Spencer simply took over and normalized Darwin's work on natural selection
 However, even after reading Darwin's work, he introduced the phrase 'survival of the best' as his own vocabulary for Darwin's concept and is often mistakenly regarded as a theorist who used Darwinian theory Applied only to society, but still reluctantly included natural selection in their entire existing system prajati roopantaran kii unke dwaara pahachaani gai praathmik kaarividhi lemarkwaadi prayog-uttaradhikaar kii thi, jisane yah pratipaadit kiya ki ang prayog yaa apaprayog ke dwaara viksit athwa nasht hote hai or yah ki ye parinamit parivartan bhavi pidiyon main bhi sanchaarit ho sakate hai
 Spencer believed that this method of gradual development was also necessary to explain 'higher' gradual development, especially for the social development of humanity
 Furthermore, unlike Darwin, he believed that there was a direction and gradual point of gradual development, which is the final stage of the attainment of equivalence
 unhone jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ko samajashasre par lagu karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He propounded that society is the result of a change from lower to higher forms, just as it is said that according to the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life develop into proper forms
 spencer kaa daawa tha ki isi prakaar maanav kaa man bhi nimnatar pashuon kii saral swachaalit pratikriyaaon se lekar vichaarsheel manushya main tark-shakti kii prakriya tak kramik rup se viksit hua tha
 According to Spencer, there were two types of knowledge: knowledge acquired by the individual and knowledge acquired by the species
 Intuition, or unconsciously learned knowledge, was the hereditary experience of the species
 spencer ne bahut utsaah ke saath auguste comte ke mul pratyakshvaadi samajashasre kaa adhyayan kiya
 Comte, a philosopher of science, had proposed a theory of socio-cultural gradual development, according to which the development of society takes place through a general rule of three stages
 haalanki, jeev-vigyaan main vibhinn parivartanon ke baad likhte hue, spencer ne comte ke pratyakshvaad ke vichaaratmak pahaluon ko khaarij karte hue saamaajik vigyaan ko kramik vikaas ke jeev-vigyaan ke sandarbh main punarnirupit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Broadly, Spencer's sociology can be described as socially Darwinist
 spencer ne tark diya ki samaaj kaa vikaas saral, samaan, samarupata se jatil, bhinn, vividhta tak ke kramik vikaas kaa udhaaharan he
 He developed a theory of two types of society, terrorist and industrial, which was in line with gradual evolutionary progress
 aatankwaadi samaaj, jisaki sanrachana padanukram or ajnapaalan ke sambandhon se milakar bani thi, saral or ek samaan tha; audyogic samaaj, jo ki svaichhik, sanvidatmak rup se sweekrut saamaajik dayitvon par aadhaarit tha, jatil or bhinn tha
 Society, which Spencer considered a 'social animal', evolved gradually from a simpler state to a more complex one according to the universal law of evolution
 iske alaava, audyogic samaaj soshal statics main viksit adarsh samaaj kaa pratyaksh vanshaj tha, haalanki spencer ne ab is baat ko spasht rup se vyakt nahin kiya ki kya samaaj kaa parinaam araajaktaavaad ke rup main milegaa yaa kya yah rajya kii ek nirantar bhoomika ko suchit karata he, haalanki ek aisi bhoomika, jo ki sanvidaaon ke pravartan or bahya suraksha ke nunatam kaaryon tak simit ho chuki hogi
 Although Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not less than his influence on structural pragmatism, his attempt to present Lamarckist or Darwinian ideas in the field of social science failed
 Even some people considered it to be actively dangerous
 Interpreters of the time, such as Wilhelm Dilthey, became the promoters of the distinction between natural sciences and human sciences
 In the 1890s, Emil Darkhim established formal academic sociology, with a strong emphasis on applied social research
 beesvin sadi ke mode par, german samajashasreiyon kii pehali peedi, sarvaadhik ullekhneey rup se maiks webar, ne vidhiparak apratyakshvaad ko prastut kiya tha
 As predicted in Spencer's first book, the creation of the 'ideal man in an ideal society' would be the last point of the process of gradual development, in which humans would have fully embraced social life
 The main difference between Spencer's early and later concepts in terms of this process was the time-scale of the gradual development involved
 manovaigyanik-or atah naitik bhi-sanrachana, jo ki hamaare purvajon dwaara vartmaan peedi ko viraasat main di gai he, tathaa jo aage ham apni bhavi pidiyon ko denge, samaaj main nivas kii aavashyaktaaon ko kramik rup se apanaae jane kii prakriya main thi
 For example, aggression was an intuition associated with survival, which necessitated the primary conditions of life, but it became unnecessary to adopt it in advanced societies
 Since human intuition had a special place in the fibers of brain tissue, it was subject to the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession, so that gradual changes could be transferred to future generations
 With the passage of several generations, the process of gradual development will ensure that humans become less aggressive and incrementally altruistic, eventually resulting in the creation of an entire society in which no one will hurt another person
 haalanki kramik vikaas ke dwaara ek purna vyakti kaa nirmaan karne ke liye yah aavashyak tha ki vartmaan or bhavi peediyaan apane vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' parinaamon kaa anubhav karen
 keval isi tareeke se vyaktiyon ko aatm-sudhaar kaa kaary karne or is prakaar apane uttaradhikariyon ko ek unnat naitik gathan pradaan karne ke liye aavashyak prerana praapt hogi
 atah vyavhaar ke 'swaabhaavik' sambandh or iske parinaam ke bich vyavdhaan utpann karne vaali kisi bhi baat ko roka janaa chaiye or isamen garibi mitaane, saarvajanik shiksha pradaan karne, yaa anivaary tikaakaran ko aavashyak banane kii rajya kii pratirodhi shakti kaa prayog bhi shaamil tha
 Although charitable donations were to be encouraged, they were also to be limited by the idea that human beings often receive sorrows as a result of their actions
 atah vyaktiyon kaa 'ayogy garibon' kii ore nirdeshit atyadhik paropkaarita vyavhaar or parinaam ke bich us kadi ko tod degi, jise spencer is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye buniyadi aavashyaktaa maanate the ki vikaas ke ucchtar str par maanavtaa kaa kramik vikaas jari rahe
 Spencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value — the greatest happiness of the greatest number — and according to him the climax of the process of evolution would be the greatest assessment of utility
 People living in an ideal society will not only get pleasure from the practice of synonyms, but they will also try to avoid causing misery to others
 They will also instinctively respect the rights of others, as a result of which the principle of justice will be adhered to globally - each person will have the maximum amount of freedom, consistent with the same amount of freedom that others receive
 'freedom' refers to the absence of coercion and is intimately tied to the right to private property
 spencer ne aacharan ke is niyam ko 'param nitishasre' kaha, jisane niti-shasr kii ek vaigyanik aadhaar vaali pranali pradaan kii, jo ateet kii aloukikta-aadhaarit niti-shasr pranaaliyon kaa sthaan le sakegi
 haalanki, unhone is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki hamaare dwaara viraasat main praapt kiya gaya naitik gathan abhi hamen param nitishasre ke niyamon ke saath purna anurupata se vyavhaar karne kii anumati nahin detaa or yahi kaaran he ki hamen 'saapeksh nitishasre' ke ek niyam kii aavashyaktaa he, jisamen hamaari vartmaan apurnataa ke vikrutisheel karkon par bhi vichaar kiya gaya ho
 Spencer's distinctive approach to musicology was also linked to his ethics
 spencer ne sochaa ki sangeet kaa udgam joshpurna vaktrutv kala main dhundha ja saktaa he
 The speaker exerts affirmative effect, not only by the rationality of his words, but also by his accent and accentuation — as Spencer expressed it, the musical qualities of his vowel act as "commentary of emotion on sentences of intelligence
" We do
 sangeet, jise vaktruta kii unki visheshta kaa ek unnat vikaas mana gaya, prajatiyon kii niti-shasr kii shiksha or vikaas main yogadan detaa he
 "the bizarre ability of us to be influenced by melodies and rhythms, perhaps, lies in both the fact that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realize those immense pleasures, and that in some way or the other they are Are related

 " spencer ke antim varshon main unka praarambhik ashavad ko nasht hota hua dikhaai diya or iskaa sthaan maanav ke bhavishya ke prati ek nirashavad ne le liya
 Despite this, he devoted most of his efforts to support his arguments and prevent misinterpretation of his important theory of non-interference
 victorian logon ke bich spencer kii pratishtha kaa bahut bada shrey unke agyeyavaad ko he
 He rejected theology as a representative of 'atheism of those who pretend piety'
 His rejection of the traditional religion earned him immense maladjustment and was often condemned by religious thinkers accusing him of being an advocate of atheism and materialism
 Nevertheless, unlike Huxley, whose agnosticism was a concentrated terrorist sect toward 'an unforgivable sin of faith', Spencer emphasized that they did not seek to devalue religion in the name of science, but rather the harmony between the two Were worried about setting up
 spencer kaa tark tha ki ham chaahe dharmik vishwaas se prarambh karen yaa vigyaan se, antat hamen kuch anivaary, lekin shabdic rup se kalpanaateet dharanaon ko sweekaar karnaa hi padataa he
 Whether we are concerned about a manufacturer or the ground level, which lies beneath our experience of facts, we cannot draw a blueprint for its concept
 Spencer concluded that, therefore, religion and science accept the ultimate truth that human understanding is only capable of understanding 'relative' knowledge
 aisa isaliye he kyonki, maanav ke man kii antarnihit simaaon ke kaaran, keval tathyon kaa gyaan praapt kar paanaa hi sambhav he, tathyon ke neeche sthit vaastaviktaa kaa nahin
 atah vigyaan or dharm donon ko yah baat sweekaar kar leni chaiye ki 'samast tathyon main yah sarvaadhik nishchit he ki brahmad main hamen jo shakti dikhaai detii he, va purnatah agamya he
 He called it the realization of the 'agnostic' and he presented the worship of the agnostic as a positive belief capable of replacing traditional religion
 vastav main, unka vichaar tha ki dharm ke kramik vikaas main agyeya antim charan, iske antim maanavarupi avasheshon ke antim nishkasana, kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 unhone yah tark bhi diya ki vyakti ke paas "rajya ko andekha karne kaa adhikaar tha
 "as a result of this perspective, Spencer was a staunch critic of patriotism
 jab unhen bataaya gaya ki dwitiya afgaan yuddh ke dauraan british senaayen sankat kii sthiti main hai, to pratikriyaswaroop unhone kaha: "jab log dusron ke aadesh par anya logon ko, unke andolan ke auchity ke bare main kuch bhi puche bina, goli maarane ke liye swayan ko kiraaye par de dete hai or yadi swayan unhen hi goli maar di jaae, to main is baat kii chintaa nahin karata
" In the last part of Victorian Britain, politics moved in the direction that Spencer disliked and his arguments provided so much ammunition for liberals and individualists in Europe and America, that they are used even in the twenty-first century

 By the 1880s, he had come to condemn "neo-conservatism"
 In The Man Versus the State, he criticized Gladstone and the Liberal Party for deviating from their true mission and instead promoting paternalistic social law
 Spencer emphasized Irish land-reform, compulsory education, laws governing workplace safety, prohibition and foreclosure laws, tax-funded pus
 Condemned libraries and welfare reforms
 He objected primarily to three things: the exercise of the government's coercive powers, the discouragement of voluntary self-improvement, and the disregard of "rules of life"
 He said the reforms were "socialism
" , They considered it equivalent to "slavery" in the context of limiting human freedom

 Spencer, in particular his "rules of equal freedom", his insistence on the limits of prophetic knowledge, his model of a naturalized social order, and his warnings about the "unintended consequences" of groupist social reforms, such as Freedrich Hayek Many analytical approaches of liberal theorists were anticipated

 Soon after his death his reputation as a philosopher sharply declined
 Half a century after his death, his work was dismissed as "imitation of philosophicalism", and historian Richard Hofstader called him "an elementalist and cracker of self-made intelligence" -barrel agnostic dubbed Prophet
 " Nevertheless, Spencer's ideas were so deeply ingrained in the Victorian period that his influence did not completely dissipate

 Hofstadter commented in his 1955 book "social Darwinism in American Thought" that Spencer's ideas inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham Summers' concept of capitalism

 Spencer also influenced the Japanese Westernist Tukotumi Soho, who believed that Japan was on the verge of transition from a "terrorist society" to an "industrial society" and that it was necessary to throw away all Japanese talk and western policy soon
 And adopt education
 He also contacted Kaneko Kentaro and warned him of the dangers of imperialism
 In his book Inside the Enemy Camp, Savarkar read all of Spencer's works, his unique influence on them, his translation into Marathi, and his influence on people like Tilak and Agarkar, and in Maharashtra He has been written about the title lovingly given to him - Harbhat Pendse

 Being highly focused on the appropriate place and order of the parts of an English sentence, he created a guide for effective writing
 Spencer's aim was to make prose writing as free of "friction and passivity" as possible, so that the reader's pace does not slow down due to the appropriate context and painstaking deliberation of the meaning of a sentence
 Spencer argued that the author's ideal "is to present ideas in such a way that the reader can understand them through the least possible mental effort"
 unhone tark diya ki arth ko yathasambhav abhigamya banaakar, lekhak ucchtam sambhav sanvadatmak dakshata hasil kar sakegaa

 Spencer also had an influence on literature and many novelists and short-story writers put his ideas in his works
 George Elliott, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy, Boleslaw Pruss, Abraham Kahn, D
H
 Lawrence, Macédo de Essis, Richard Austin Freeman, and Jorge Louise Borges all referenced Spencer
 Arnold Bennett highly praised the First Principles and its influence on Bennett can be seen in many of his novels

 Outside of the adventures recorded by Dr
 Watson, little is known about the biography of Sherlock Holmes and not even in the original stories of Conan Doyle; Nevertheless, relevant information about his early life and detailed family form an outline of this detective's life
 kahani hiz last bo main homes kaa janm andazan 1854 ke aas-paas lagata he; aam taur par, tarikh ko 6 janvari ke rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he
 Holmes says that when he was in the pre-graduation class, he first developed the permissions method
 Author Dorothy L
 Shares suggested that according to the information of the two exploits, Holmes would have been in Cambridge rather than Oxford and that "of all the colleges in Cambridge, Sydney Sussex probably offered the most benefits to someone with a Holmes-like situation and more accurate information
" In the default, we can tentatively place it there
 uske praarambhik maamle, jinhen usne ek shaukia ke taur par anjaam diya, uske vishvavidhyalay ke saathi chaatro ke madhyam se aae the
 According to Holmes, a visit to the father of one of his classmates prompted him to take up espionage as a profession and he spent six years as a consulting detective after university work, until financial difficulties led him to Watson Not forced to take it as his room mate, at which point the narration of the stories begins
 1881 se, varnan he ki 221B baker street, landan, homes kaa thikaana tha jahaan se vah apni nijee jasusi agency chalaata he
 221B seventeen steps up is a flat which in an old manuscript has been called the "upper end" of the road
 dow watasan ke aane tak, homes akele kaam karata tha, kabhi-kabhaar hi shahar ke chote tabake se agenton ko niojit karata tha, jisamen dher saare mubir or bazaaru bacchon kaa ek samooh tha jise vah baker street irregulars kahata tha
 Irregulators appear in three stories, "the Sign of the Four", "A Study in Scarlet" and "the Adventure of the Crooked Man"

 The stories do not mention his parents and he only states that his ancestors were "rural chieftains"

 He has an older brother, Mycroft, a government official, who appears in three stories; He is mentioned in many other stories

 It has been reported that Mycroft has far more capacity than Sherlock in terms of observation and permissions

 It is not clear whether Holmes has other siblings
 "da adventure of da copper biches" main homes kahata he,"main kabool karata hum ki yah, vah paristhiti nahin he jisamen main apni bahan ko dekhnaa chaahunga", jisase kuch logon ko unke astitv kaa andeshaa hota he
 But in such a case, he asks a woman to warn him as his sister, so it can only be a figurative language
 homes apana adhikansh vyavsaayik samay apane achche mitra or kalkram se abhilekhan karanevaale watasan ke saath saajha karte hai, jo 1887 main apni shaadi hone se pehle or apni patni kii mrityu hone ke baad punah kuch samay ke liye homes ke saath rahata he; uskaa ghar, uski makaan malkin, shrimati hadsan sambhalati hai
 Watson has two roles in Holmes's life
 pehali, vah uske maamalon ke sanchaalan main vyaavhaarik sahaayta detaa he; vah jasoos kaa dahinaa haath he, jo khoji, jhansa dene vaala, sahyogi or doot ke vibhinn roopon main kaary karata he
 Second, he is a historian of Holmes
 Most of Holmes's stories are phenomenological narratives, written from Watson's point of view as a summary of the detective's most interesting cases
 homes ko aksar watasan ke lekhan ko sansanikhez or loklubhaavan kehete hue ullikhit kiya gaya he, yah sujhaate hue ki lekh uski kala ke shuddh gananaa "vigyaan" kii nishpaksh or sateek report pesh nahin karte
 Nevertheless, Holmes's friendship with Watson is undoubtedly his most important relationship
 kai kahaniyon main, watasan ke liye homes kaa sneh- aksar uske thande, bauddhik bahya swarup ke peeche chipa hua- ujagar ho jaataa he
 "in The Adventure of the Three Garidebs, Watson is injured in a confrontation with a villain; although the bullet wound proves to be" very superficial ", Watson is elated by Holmes' response: kul milakar, homes ke taees saal sakriy rup se kaary karte rahane kaa varnan he jis dauraan watasan ne uske satraa maamalon ko lipibaddh kiya
 Holmes retires in 1903-04 to a Bee Farm in Sussex Downs where he takes the hobby of beekeeping as his primary occupation and eventually "practical Hand Book of Bee Culture, with Some Observations Upon the Segregation of the Queen "
 keval ek maamla, jo homes dwaara swayan varnit he or jisaki vah ek shaukia taur par chaan-been kar rahaa tha, jasoos kii sevanivritti ke dauraan ghatit hota he
 Holmes describes himself as "faked" in terms of habits and lifestyle
 watasan ke anusaar, homes ek sanakee he, jise saafe-safaai yaa suvyavastha ke samakaleen maanakon se koi lagaav nahin he
 In an early story, Watson describes Holmes as: jo chiz dusron ko avyavashtha-si lagati he, vah homes ko upyogi jaankariyon kaa bhandar dikhti he
 Holmes in the stories dips into his shattered web of random documents and artifacts to find exactly the specific document or anything he is looking for
 vyaktigat swatchta ke maamle main, virodhabhas swaroop, homes ko "da hound of da baskeravilles" main vyaktigat safai se ek "billi-jaisaa" pyaar karne vaala varnit kiya he
 In no way does this seem to impede the very practical pursuit of his profession, however; Holmes's first story, "A Study in Scarlet," has his hands dirty with acid stains, while Holmes later uses his own blood drops for chemical experimentation
 watasan aksar homes ke khaane kii anishchit aadaton ko chihnit karata he
 Detective is often described as starving himself during times of intense intellectual activity, as during The Adventure of the Norwood Builder, where Watson states: homes kaa itihaaskaar uske pipe upyog karne kii aadat, yaa uske cigarette or cigar, ke apekshaakrit kam prayog ko bura nahin maanata
or na hi watasan, homes dwaara ek muvakkil ke liye sach modane yaa kanoon todane kii tatparta kii ninda karata he jahaan uskaa maananaa he ki yah naitik rup se uchit he
 Holmes is depicted as a patriot, who in many stories is working on behalf of the government in matters of national security
 vah hiz last bo main counter-intelligence kaa kaary bhi karata he jo WWI kii shuruuaat main avasthit he
 As a shooting exercise, the detective has decorated the wall of his Baker Street hideout with a "VR" mark made from his pistol bullets
 homes kaa abhimaan yada-kada ghamand kaa rup le letaa he; yadhyapi auchity ke saath; vah police nirikshakon ko apane utkrisht nishkarshon se uljhaakar anand praapt karata he
 He does not aspire to fame and is generally satisfied by allowing the police to take public credit for his work
 yah aksar hi hota he ki jab watasan apni kahaniyon ko prakashit karata he, to maamle main homes kii bhoomika spasht ho jaati he
 Holmes's conduct is rendered neutral and cold
 phir bhi ek saahasik kaary ke bich, ullekhneey junun ke saath, homes chamak dikhaa saktaa he
 He has a tendency to perform and has a wide net to catch a criminal and unleash his crime, often to impress Watson or one of the Scotland Yard inspectors
 homes kabhi-kabhi nashili dawaaon kaa upyog karata he, khaas kar jab uttejk maamalon kii kami rahati he
 He is addicted to cocaine, which is pierced by the use of a special needle in a seven percent solution that he holds in a leather shell
 homes opium kaa bhi yada-kada upyog karata he, lekin ek opium adde par jane kii baat par usne ghor asweekruti vyakt kii
 All three were justified in England in the late 19th century
 homes dwaara nashili dawaaon ke prayog se koi chikitsakeey aapatti naa dikhaakar, dow watasan, victorian chikitsa kattarpanthi ko darshaate he
 Naively, he denounces his friend's habit, describing it as "the only evil" of the detective, and expressing concern about Holmes' mental health and its potential impact on excellent intelligence
 baad kii kathaon main, watasan homes ko drugs se dur karne kaa daawa karte hai
 Nevertheless, according to his medical friend, Holmes remains an addict whose habit was "not dead, but sleeping only
" " Although he initially needs Watson to share the rent of his comfortable residence at 221B Baker Street, in "the Adventure of the Dying Detective", Watson reveals, "I have no doubt when Holmes lived alone" That the house would probably have been bought at the price that Holmes pays for his room, "pointing out that he generated a good income from his behavior, though it was properly He did not know how much he charged for his services
 vah "da problem of thor brij" main yah zarur kahata he ki "meraa peshewar shulk ek nishchit str par he
 i don't change them, only when i forgive them completely 


 " yah ek aise sandarbh main kaha gaya he jab ek graahak ne usko uski fees kaa duguna dene kii peshkash kii; lekin, yah sambhav he ki dhani graahak homes ko uske maanak shulk se kaafii zyaada paarishramik pradaan karte hai: "da adventure of da final problem" main homes kahata he ki france kii sarkaar or scandenevia ke shahi nivas ne uski sevaaon ke liye use paryaapt dhan diya he jisase vah aaraam se ritair ho saktaa he, jabaki "da adventure of blike peter" main watasan ne ingit kiya he ki homes, amir or taqatvar logon kii madad se inkaar kar detaa tha yadi usko unka maamla pasand nahin aata, jabaki atyadhik vinamr graahakon ke maamalon ke liye vah puure saptaah kaa samay samarpit kar detaa tha
 In "A Case of Identity", Holmes also tells Watson that after "A Scandal in Bohemia", the King of Bohemia gave him a golden snuff box and received a magnificent ring from the Dutch royal family; In "the Adventure of the Bruce - Partington Plans", Holmes receives an emerald tie-pin from Queen Victoria
 homes ke maamalon ke anya smriti chihn hai ireni edler se praapt sone kii ginni or france ke raashtrapati kaa ek hastakshrit dhanyavad patr or huret naam ke ek hatyare ko pakadvane ke liye lejan of honor da adventure of da golden pins-nez "da adventure of da priari skool" main homes ullas ke saath apana haath malataa he" jab holdernes kaa duk raashi ko likhata he, jisase watasan ko bhi aashcharya hota he or uske baad check ko thapki detaa he, yah kah kar ki "main ek garib aadmi hum," ek ghatana jise homes kii vidambnaapurna hasya kii pravriti ke rup main kaarij kiya ja saktaa he
 Certainly, during his career, Holmes worked for both the most powerful kings and governments of Europe and various wealthy nobles and industrialists and was also approached for advice by poor moneylenders and humble teachers of the lower ranks of society
 apane kharchon ke liye homes, graahakon se paise vasuulata he or samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye prastaavit kisi bhi inaam kaa daawa kar saktaa he: vah "da adventure of da specold band" main kahata he ki miss stoner uske dwaara kiye gaye kharche ko de saktin hai or anurodh karata he ki "da red-heded lig" bank, uske dwaara maamle par kiye gaye kharche kii bharpai kare
 "da adventure of da beril coronet main chori hue ratna ko punah praapt karne main ai laagat kaa bhugtan karne ke liye homes ke paas uskaa amir banker graahak he or vah us inam par bhi daawa karata he jo us banker ne khojane vaale ke liye ghoshit kiya tha
 The only woman to influence Holmes was Irene Adler, who was always referred to by Holmes as "the woman"
 homes ko khud is shabd kaa sidhe prayog karte hue uddhrut nahin kiya gaya he- bhale hi vah anya maamalon main uskaa asli naam kai baar letaa he
 Adler is one of the few women cited in all of Holmes's stories, although she actually appears in only one story, "A Scandal in Bohemia
" ek kahani main, "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" shaadi ke liye homes kii mangani ho jaati he, lekin keval apane maamle ke liye jaankaree jutaney kii ichha se
vah raste main aane vaali bahut adhik aakarshak mahila graahakon ke prati spasht ruchi darshata he, 
 homes ne anivaary rup se "apane graahak main aage koi ruchi nahin dikhaai jab vah uski ek samasya ke centre se baahar chali gai
 "holmes found his youth, beauty and energy distinct from any romantic interest, appealing
 aise prakaran homes ke aakarshan ko darshaate hai, abhi tak edler ke maamle ke alaava, kisi gambhir yaa dirghakaalik lagaav kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Watson wrote that Holmes "hates women" but "has a bizarre way of finding favor", with Holmes saying, "I am not a fan of the feminine heart"; In fact, he finds "the intention of women 


 so cryptic 


 how can you build on such a deceptive object? Their smallest action can cost a lot
" 

 unka sabase asaadhaaran vyavhaar baalo ke ek pin par nirbhar kar saktaa he
 "however, Doyle recalled Joseph Bell saying," Holmes Babbage is just as inhuman as the calculating machine and with all the possibility of falling in love
 " Another interesting aspect of Holmes's relationship with women is that the source of the pleasure he gets from his company is the problems he brings
 sin of da four main, watasan ne homes ko "ek yantra maanav, ek gananaa mashin," ke rup main uddhrut kiya he or homes ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he,"yah sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he, ki apane faisle ko vyaktigat gunon dwaara purvaagrahagrast hone kii anumati nahin deni chahie
ek graahak mere liye maatr ek ikai he, - samasya main ek kaarak

 i can assure you that the woman i found the most attractive to date was hanged for poisoning three young children for insurance money
 

" yah saamaanya rup se mahilaon ke saath or vishesh rup se muvakkil ke saath homes kii sambandh banane main anichhaa ko sanderbhit karata he, jaisaa ki watasan ne kaha "kabhi-kabhi tumhaare andar ek sakaaratmak amanviyata dikhti he
 At the end of "the Adventure of the Devil's Foot," Holmes says: "I have never loved Watson, but if i did, and if the woman i loved had an end, i might have been one of my willing lions Behaves like a hunter
 "in the story, investigator Dr
 Sterndale kills the man who killed his girlfriend, Brenda Tragenis, in order to exact an exact revenge that the law could not provide
 La
 "in The Adventure of the Dying Detective, Watson writes that Mrs
 Hudson likes Holmes in her own way, despite her cynical eccentricity as a tenant, due to her remarkably gentle and courteous behavior with women
" In The Sign of the Four, Watson once again quotes Holmes as saying, "I won't tell them too much
" Never trust women completely, homes kii praathmik bauddhik tahakikat vidhi he ek aparaadh ke samaadhaan kaa anumiti tark "pani kii ek boond se", vah likhata he, "ek taarkik vyakti atlantic yaa niagara kii sambhaavna kaa anumaan laga saktaa he bina ek ko dekhe yaa duusare ko sune
"homes kii kahaniyaan aksar uski "anumiti" kii sahaspurn pratibha ke pradarshan ke saath shuru hoti hai
 It is of little interest to logicians and those interested in logic to try to analyze what Holmes is doing during his permissions
 prathit hota he ki homiya anumiti, nishkarsh nikaalane se nirmit he jo praathmik rup se yaa to sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton par aadhaarit he jo satark aagamanaatmak adhyayan kaa parinaam he jaise ki vibhinn prakaar ke cigar kii raakh kaa homes kaa adhyayan athwa sarvottam vivaran se prasphutit nishkarsh he
 The form of Holmes's straight-line pragmatics is generally, "if 'p', then 'q', where 'p' is the visible proof and 'q' is what the evidence indicates
 lekin vahaan madhyavarti siddhant bhi hai, jaisaa ki nimna udhaaharan main dekha ja saktaa he
 In "A Scandal in Bohemia" Holmes permits that Watson was very wet recently and that her "maid girl was very clumsy and careless"
 When surprised, Watson asks how Holmes knows this
 Holmes answers: is maamle main, homes ne kai jude siddhanton kaa prayog kiya: By explicitly applying such principles, Holmes is able to infer that: "watasan ke juute ke kinare, kai saamanantar kataav se chhile hue hai"; se "watasan kii naukaraani foohad or laaparvaah he"; or "watasan haal hi main bahut geela rahaa he or gande mausam main baahar gaya tha
 " anumiti tark homes ko prabhaavshaalee dhang se ek ajanabi ke vyavsaay kaa khulaasa karne main sakasham banaate hai, jaise ki a study in skarlet main marine ke ek sevanivrutt sargent; da red-heded lig main ek jahaaj kaa purv badhai jo mahajan ban gaya; or ek billiard-marker or da adventure of da greek interprator main ek topakhane kaa sevanivrutt NCO
 isi tarah, nirjeev vastuon kaa adhyayan karke, homes unke maalikon ke bare main ascharyajanak vistrut nishkarsh nikaalane main sakasham he, jisamen shaamil he da sin of da four main watasan kii jeb-ghadi or saath hi saath anya kahaniyon main ek topi, ek pipe, or ek chadi
 Once he has accumulated a lot of evidence and allowed possible interpretations and to present a solution, Holmes moves to one interpretation that matches all the facts of the case
 jaisaa ki homes watasan ko bataata he, "jab tumne asambhav ko hataa diya, to jo bhi bachaa, haalanki asambhavit, avashya sach hona chahie
" Holmes demonstrates a keen interest in acting and making pseudo-vests
 kai kahaniyon main, vah saboot ikattha karne ke liye itnaa swaabhaavik chhadam vesh dhaaran karata he ki watasan bhi use nahin pakad paata, jaisaa ki "da adventure of charles augustus milveraton" main, da main wyeth da twisted lip or a scandle in bohemia main
anya karnaamon main, homes apane maamle ko prabhavi banane ke liye ghayal hone kaa yaa biimaar hone kaa bahaanaa karata he, yaa shaamil logon ko doshi tehraata he, jaise "da adventure of da daaing detective" main
 Pistol Holmes and Watson carry pistols with them; Often his old service revolver in Watson's case
 haalanki, watasan keval saat maukon par in hathiyaaron ke istemaal kii charchaa karata he
 'stick Holmes as a gentleman, often walking with a stick or stick
 watasan dwaara use lakdi kii talwaar main visheshgy varnit kiya gaya he or vah do baar apni chadi kaa upyog ek hathiyaar ke rup main karata he
 In Talwar a Study in Scarlett, Watson describes Holmes as an expert in swordsmanship — though in no story Holmes has used the sword
 "gloria scot" main isaki charchaa he ki homes ne talwaar kaa abhyaas kiya he
 Whip In many stories, Holmes appears armed with a whip
 da adventure of da specold band main iskaa prayog vah ek jahrile saanp ko maarane ke liye karata he or a cese of aaidentity main usase ek thag ko maarane ke liye kareeb aata he
 Holmes, using a "whip" in "the red-headed League", drops a pistol from John Clay's hands
 mukkebaazi homes nangi ungaliyon se ek vikat ladaaku ke rup main varnit he
 In The Sign of the Four, Holmes introduces himself to a professional boxer as: kahaniyon main kai avasaron par homes, ubharate hue apane pratidwandviyon ke saath guttham-guttha ladaai main uljhe, jahaan ve anivaary rup se vijeta rahe
 "gloria scot" main yah doharaaya gaya he ki homes ek mukkebaaz ke rup main prashikshit he
 In the martial arts The Adventure of the Empty House, Holmes tells Watson how he overcame Professor Moriart by using martial arts and slamming his adversary on the Raishenbach Falls
 vah kahata he ki "haalanki, mujhe kuch gyaan he, baritsu, kaa yaa kushti kii japani pranali kaa, jo kai baar mere liye bahut upyogi sabit hui he
 The name "baritsu" appears to be a reference to real-life martial arts Bartitsu
 pehali hi kahani a study in skarlet main, homes kii prishthbhumi ke bare main kuch diya gaya he
 In the first half of 1881, he was introduced as an independent student of chemistry with many diverse inquisitive interests, almost all of which appeared to him to be better at solving crimes
 An early story, "the Adventure of the" Gloria Scott "", provides more background for who influenced Holmes to become a detective: The father of a college friend gave him a brownish appreciation of his permissiveness skills
 Holmes strictly follows the scientific method and emphasizes the power of arguments and observation and permissiveness
 a study in skarlet main, homes kaa daawa he vah nahin jaanata ki prithvi surya ke chaaron ore gumti he, chunki is tarah kii jaankaree uske kaam ke liye apraasangik he
 After hearing this fact directly from Watson, he says that he will immediately try to forget her
 He states that he believes that the brain has a limited capacity to store information and therefore learning redundant will only reduce its ability to learn useful things
 Dr
 Watson later assesses Holmes' ability to is: yahaan tak ki a study in skarlet ke ant main, yah dikhaaya gaya he ki homes latin jaanata he or mul roman sukhtiyon ke anuwaad kii koi jarurat nahin padati, haalanki jasusi kaary ke liye bhashaa ke gyaan kii pratyaksh upyogita ndehpurn he
 Later stories also refute the list
 homes kii raajnneeti se sambhavit agyanta ke baavjood "a scandle in bohemia" main vah tathakthith "count won kram" kii asli pahchaan ko turant bhaanp jaataa he
 In relation to non-sensational literature, his speech is replete with references to the Bible, Shakespeare, even Goethe
 iske alaava, da adventure of da bruce- partington plance main watasan suchit karata he ki navambar 1895 main, "homes khud ko ek vinibandh main dubaa letaa he jo usne poliphonic motets of lasus se liya tha"- ek atyadhik gudh kshetra, jiske liye homes ko apni smriti ko jaankaree ke ek vishaal bhandar se, jiskaa kii aparaadh kii ladaai se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, avyavasthit karnaa hoga- itnaa vyapak gyaan ki uske vinibandh ko is vishay par "antim alphaz" mana jaataa he
 Later narratives refute the notion that Holmes is unwilling to know anything unless it is immediately relevant to his occupation; In the second chapter of The Valley of Fear, Holmes would rather declare that "all knowledge is useful to the detective" and at the end of The Adventure of the Lions Men he calls himself "an all-in-one of memory with bizarre conception
" The subject reader defines as "
 " Holmes is also a competent code specialist
 vah watasan ko sambodhit karata he,"main kuta lekhan ke sabhi roopon se kaaphi parichit hum or is vishay par ek tuchh vinibandh kaa main khud lekhak hum, jisamen main ek sau saath alag sankethik shabdon kaa vishleshan kar rahaa hum

 There are fifty-six short stories written by Conan Doyle and four novels called Law by Homian

 As a tribute, more or less the authors have created many pop culture references from Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle, or the characters in the stories
 is tarah ke sanket ek kathanak ke vikaas kaa kaary karte hai, hisse ke bauddhik str ko badha sakate hai yaa ek chaukas darshak ke liye easter andey ke rup main vyavhaar kar sakate hai
 Some have been outspoken who presented Holmes as a character in a new setting, or a slightly more subtle hint, such as building a logical character while living in an apartment number 221B
 a well-known example of this is Gregory House's character in the House MD show, whose name and apartment number both refer to Holmes

 a third major reference is a quote, "this is easy, my dear Watson,"
 Another erroneous credit is generally given that Holmes is not explicitly described in the entire novel series, wearing a hunter hat
 " haalanki, homes ne ek kaan tak latakati yatra topi "da adventure of silver blez" main zarur pahani he
 Sidney Paget first depicted Holmes in The Hunters Hat and Inverness Cap in The Boscombe Valley Mystery and many other later stories

 It is notable, however, that a later narration of a story in 1892 is described
 conan doyal ne kahaniyon kaa pehla set ek dashak ke dauraan likhaa
apane aitihaasik upanyaason ke liye or adhik samay dene kii ichha se unhone "da final problem" main homes ko maar daalaa, jo 1893 main prakashit hui

 haalanki janata kahani se prasann hui, lekin ek maranoparant homes se vah santusht nahin thi or isliye conan doyal ne do saal baad homes ko punerjeevit kiya
 Many considered Doyle's intention to bring Holmes alive, most notably writer-director Nicholas Meyer, who wrote an essay on the subject titled "the Great Man Takes a Speech" in the 1970s
 The real reason is not known
 Are, apart from the obvious: publishers offered to pay generously
 Whatever the reason, Conan Doyle continued to write Holmes stories for a quarter century
 kuch lekhakon ne antaraal ke liye anya spashtikaran die hai
 In Meyer's novel The seven-per-saint Solution, the interval is shown as a secret sabbatical when Holmes treats Sigmund Freud's cocaine addiction and presents Holmes with the pleasing suggestion that Watson Claiming that he has been killed by morirt, he will present a fictional account and say about the people, "they never wish you any good Vas will not

 Maharaj Dhritarashtra was anxious to know the details of his conversation with Yudhishthira

 Thinking of this, Sanjay Maharaj returned home to console Dhritarashtra

 Sanjay did not tell him anything clearly
 unki chintaa kaa vishay tha, yudhisthir kaa nirnay
 In fact, Maharaj Dhritarashtra was surrounded by uncertainty
 kahana bada kathin tha ki yudhisthir ke paas se sanjay kya samachar laae hai? unke man kaa chor unhen vyakul kiye hue tha
 The question was - to whom should he reveal the state of his mind? And finally, in the hour of uncertainty and doubt, he remembers his supreme soul Vidur
 vidura ne dyut krida ke samay maharaj dhritarashtra ko chetaya tha ki yadi yah khel samaapt nahin kiya gaya to anarth ho jayega
 Hastinapur would not be able to avoid going to the brink of destruction and Maharaj could not see physically being visually impaired, he could not understand even when Vidur was persuaded

 How could he stake the authority of Ganga-son Devavrata? Knowing the reason of the father's concern, Ganga-son Devavrata himself pledged to Nishadraj that 'nishadraj! Only the son born from the womb of your daughter will inherit the kingdom of Hastinapur
 ’’ is baat par bhi nishadaraaj kaa sanshay samaapt na hua

 The history of mathematics in India is mainly divided into 5 periods- bharat main dashamalav pranali harappakaal main astitv main thi jaisaa ki hadappa ke baaton or maapon ke vishleshan se pataa chalata he
 Weights with ratios of 0
05, 0

5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 have been identified during that period
 dashamalav vibhaajan vaale paimaane bhi mili hai
 One particular thing about Harappan weights and measures that attracts attention is their purity
 ek kaanse kii chad jis par 0
367 inch kii ikaayiyon main ghat bane hue hai, us samay kii baariki kii maatr kii maang kii ore ishaara karata he
 Such net measuring scales were particularly important to ensure compliance with city planning rules because they were of particular importance for the construction of fixed width roads cutting each other at right angles and the exit of net measurements and for building buildings according to specific instructions

 Records of mathematical activities in the Vedic period are found in the Vedas mostly with religious rituals
 phir bhi, anya kai krishi aadhaarit pracheen sabhyataaon kii tarah yahaan bhi ankaganit or jyamiti kaa adhyayan dharmanirpeksh kriyakalapon se bhi prerit tha
 Thus to some extent, ancient mathematical advancements developed in India in the same way as in Egypt, Babylon and China

 When land was redistributed, they were consolidated, there was a problem of land metering which needed to be resolved and to ensure that the equivalent distribution of land in all the cultivars keeping in mind the variation of irrigated and non-irrigated land and fertility
 If possible, the ownership of the farmer in each village was divided into several categories so that the allocation of land could be justified
 saare chak ek hi aakaar ke hon, yah sambhav nahin tha
 Therefore, local administrators had to convert importers or triangular areas into square areas of equivalent magnitude or perform similar tasks

 Some of these formulas take them to the nearest value and some give absolute values and to some extent reveal practical precision and understanding of basic geometric principles

 Modern scholars differ on how these results were derived
 kuch kaa vishwaas he ki ye parinaam atkal vidhi athwa rule aaf thamb athwa kai udaahranon se praapt nateezon ke saadhaaraneekaran se nikaale gaye hai
 The second view is that once the scientific law was enshrined in the jurisprudence - proofs of such results must have been given, but these evidences were lost or destroyed or they were spread orally through the Gurukula system and only the final result was the scriptures

 1000 BC It is written in Vedang astrology - Just like the peacock feathers and the Nagamani are adorned on the topmost place or body in the body, similarly in all branches of Vedas and scriptures, mathematics occupies the top position

 a special advancement in the history of Indian science, which had a serious impact on all subsequent mathematical texts, was the work by Panini, the pioneer of Sanskrit grammar and linguistics
 dhvanishastra or sanrachana vigyaan par ek vishad or vaigyanik siddhant puri vyakhya ke saath prastut karte hue panini ne apane sanskrit vyakaran ke granth ashtaadhi main vidhi sammat shabd utpaadan ke niyam or paribhaashaayen prastut kin

 were classified

 Today, Panini's configurations can also be compared to modern definitions of a mathematical function

 Ingerman in his dissertation "panini - Backus Farm" has given Panini's symbols as strong as the signs of Backus
 baikas narmal farm aadhunik computor bhashaaon ke vaakyavinyas kaa varnan karne ke liye vyavahrut hota he jiskaa avishkaaraktrta baikas he
 Panini's works thus presented an example of the introduction of scientific notations that may have inspired the use of abstract notation to describe algebraic equations and present algebraic theorems and their fruits in a scientific blueprint
 darshanik siddhanton kaa ganitiya pariklpanaaon or sutreey padon ke vikaas par gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 Like the Upanishads view of the world, the sky and time were also considered infinite in Jain philosophy
 isse bahut badi sankhyaon or aparimit sankhyayon kii paribhaashaon main gahari ruchi paidaa hui
 Unlimited numbers were created through repetition formulas
 anuyogdwar sutara main aisa hi kiya gaya
 Jain mathematicians gave five types of infinite numbers: 3ri sadi i
 pus
 main rachit bhagwati sutron main or 2ri sadi i
 pus
 main rachit sthanang sutara main kramchay-sanchay ko soochibaddh kiya gaya he
 The Jain set theory probably originated in parallel with the syllogism of Jaina wisdom epistemology, in which reality has been described as condition-of-truths and phase-change duets of truth
 anuyogdwar sutara ghaataank niyam ke bare main ek vichaar detaa he or ise laghuganak kii sankalpana viksit karne ke liye upyog main laata he
 For log basis 2, log base 3 and log base 4, the terms half quasi, triac facade and quadratic have been used respectively
 shatkhandgam main kai samucchyon par laagarithmik functions aadhaar 2 kii kriya, unka varg nikaalkar, unka vargamul nikaalkar or simit yaa aseemit ghaat lagaakar kii gai hai
 New sets have been made by repeating these actions again and again
 anya kritiyon main dwipad prasar main aane vaale gunakon kaa sanyojanon kii sankhya se sambandh dikhaaya gaya he
 Since some degree of uncertainty is acceptable when describing reality in Jaina wisdom epistemology
 atah anishchayatmak samikarnon se jujhane main or aparimey sankhyaon kaa nikatatam sankhyatmak maan nikaalane main vah sambhavatya sahaayak hui
 Buddhist literature also shows awareness of indefinite and infinite numbers
 buddha ganit kaa vargeekaran 'gananaa' yane saral ganit yaa 'sankhyan' yane ucchtar ganit main hua
 Numbers are considered to be of three types: Sankheya means countable, uncountable means uncountable and infinite
 ank shunya kii pariklpana prastut karne main, shunya ke sambandh main darshanik vichaaron ne madad kii hogi
 It seems that in the numerical system of local values, the practice of writing the cipher in a blank space may have been going on long ago, but the algebraic definition of zero and its relation to mathematical action is only seen in the mathematical texts of Brahmagupta in the 7th century
 Get to vidwaanon main is masale par matbhed he ki shunya ke liye sanket chinh bharat main kabase prayukt hona shuru hua
 Ifra strongly believes that the use of zero was prevalent even in Aryabhata's time
 parantu guptkaal ke antim samay main shunya kaa upyog bahutayat se hone laga tha
 Indian numerals developed into their modern form between the 7th and 11th centuries and became the foundation stones of modern mathematical signs with signs denoting various mathematical functions such as money, debt, square root etc
 yadhyapi china main bhi dashamalav aadhaarit gananaa paddati prayog main thi, kintu unki sanket pranali bhartiya sanket chinh pranali jitani shuddh or saral na thi or yah bhartiya sanket pranali hi thi jo arabon ke marfat pashchimi duniyaan main pahunchi or ab vah saarvbhaumik rup main sweekrut ho chuki he
 a number of factors contributed to this phenomenon, whose importance is perhaps best described by French mathematician laplace: "A unique method of representing every possible number by a set of ten signs in which each sign has a local value and an absolute value
" , Originated in India itself
 yah vidhi aajkal itani saral lagati he ki iske gambhir or prabhaavshaalee mahatv par dhyaan hi nahin jaataa
 This made the calculation much easier by its simple method and made arithmetic the leading category of useful inventions
 ’’ This invention was brilliant but it did not happen suddenly
 pashchimi jagat main jatil roman ankiy pranali ek badi baadha ke rup main pragat hui or china kii chitralipi bhi ek rukaawat thi
 But everything was favorable for such development in India

 Panini's theory of language and the study of legalism and representationalism in art and architecture, as well as the difficult knowledge of rationalist theory and justice formulations coupled with the latest sense of epistemology and syllogism and Buddhist knowledge helped to advance this number theory

 Perhaps this stimulated interest in arithmetic and geometric categories

 Knowledge of mathematics, astrology, especially tides, and constellations was of great importance to the merchant communities as they had to cross the deserts and oceans at night

 Those wishing to go away for commerce inevitably had to take some basic information in constellation
 isse is vidya ke shikshakon kii sankhya kaaphi badi jinhone bihar ke kusumpur yaa madhya bharat ke ujjain athwa apekshaakrit chote sthaneey kendron yaa gurukulon main prashikshan praapt kiya
 There was also exchange of books of mathematics and constellation among scholars and this knowledge spread from one area to another

 Sanskrit was the only medium in the communication of science
 beej ropan samay or fasalon kaa chunaav nishchit karne ke liye aavashyak tha ki jalwaayu or vrishti kii ruparekha kii jaankaree behatar ho
 These requirements and the need for a pure almanac put the horse of astrology at bay

 Aryabhata, a great scientist of the Gupta period, who was born in 476 AD in Kusumpur, Bihar, gave a well-ordered explanation of the position of planets in space
 prithvi ke apane aksh par ghurnan ke bare main unki pariklpana sahi thi tathaa grahon kii kaksha dirghavritakar he unka yah nishkarsh bhi sahi tha
 He also properly proved that the moon and other planets were illuminated by the reflection of sunlight
 unhone surya grahan or chandra grahan se sambandhit sabhi andhvishwaason or puranic manyataon ko nakaarte hue in ghatnaon kii uchit vyakhya kii thi
 Although Bhaskar I, born in the 6th century, Saurashtra and a student of the School of Ashmak Sciences, Nizamabad, Andhra, recognized his talent and the immense importance of his scientific contributions
 unke baad aane vaale kuch jyotishiyon ne prithvi ko achal maanate hue, grahanon ke bare main unki bauddhik vyakhyaaon ko nakaar diya
 But despite these contrasts, Aryabhata had a serious influence on the later astrologers and mathematicians who were his followers, especially the scholars of the Ashmak School
 soramandal ke sambandh main aryabhat kaa krantikari gyaan viksit hone main ganit kaa yogadan jeevant tha
 The pie value, the circumference of the Earth / 62832 mi / s and the length of the solar year, were less than 12 minutes apart from modern calculations and some calculations that were very close to the net value
 in gananaaon ke samay aryabhat ko kuch aise ganitiya prashn hal karne pade jinhen bijganit or trikonmiti main bhi pehle kabhi nahin kiya gaya tha
 Bhaskar i explained the unfinished work of Aryabhata in detail about subjects like longitude of planets and longitudes of planets, relation of planets to mutual and bright constellations, rise and fall of planets and Chandrakala
 in adhyayanon ke liye or adhik viksit ganit kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Hence Bhaskara elaborated the trigonometric equations generated by Aryabhata and, like Aryabhata, came to the correct conclusion that pi is an irrational number
 uskaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn yogadan he - jya falan kii gananaa jo 11 pratishat tak shuddh he
 He also did fundamental work on indeterminate equations that no one had done before and first discussed quadrilaterals whose four sides were unequal and they did not have parallel faces
 aisa hi ek doosraa mahatvapurn jyotirvid ganitagya varahamihir ujjain main 6 veen sadi main hua tha jisane ganit jyotish par purv likhit pustakon ko ek saath lipibaddh kiya or aryabhatta ke trikoshmetiya sutron kaa bhandar badhaayaa
 His works on permutations and combinations perfected the achievements of Jain mathematicians on the subject and gave a method of deriving the rigorous values that are very similar to the cutting edge "pascal's triangle"
 7 veen sadi main brahmagupta ne bijganit ke mul siddhanton ko soochibaddh karne kaa mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 In addition to listing the algebraic properties of zeros, he also listed the algebraic properties of negative numbers
 quadratic inditorminete samikarnon kaa hal nikaalane sambandhi uske kaary islar or lagrange ke kaaryon kaa purvabhaas pradaan karte hai
 While developing an accurate map of the lunar eclipse, Aryabhata had to present the hypothesis of infinitecimal, that is, by estimating infinitely subtle numbers to understand the superlative or almost instantaneous motion of the moon, he presented it as a fundamental differential equation

 American football is a popular sport played between two teams of eleven players, in which each team aims to score points by placing the ball in the other team's "end zone"
 jis team ke paas gend par qabza hota he, vah gend ke saath daudkar yaa apane saathiyon main aapas main gend phenkakar use virdohi team ke oundzon tak badhaane kii koshish karti he
 If a player from that team crosses the goal line by holding the ball and reaches the opposing endzone, or successfully catches the ball thrown by his partner standing inside the endzone or two behind the goal line from the field If he delivers the ball by kicking it between the poles, then his team gets points
 virdohi team kaa kaam he ki takkar markar, giraakar, yaa bich main aakar phenki gai gend ko pakadakar kisi tarah gend par qabza kare yaa dushman team ko apni team ke oundzon kii taraf badhane se roke
 American football is played mostly in the United States and Canada
 iske khel ko vyavsaayik str par niyantrit karne vaali santhaan kaa naam "naishanal footbaal lig" he, jise chote rup main chhanalfail kaha jaataa he
 In the US, there are two main forms of the sport, college football and professional football, whose rules differ slightly from one another
 skulon kii ucch kakshaon main bhi footbaal kheli jaati he or uske niyam bhi thode bhinn hote hai
 The playground is 100 ghz long and 53
3 ghz wide
 maidan kii lambaai ke donon taraf ek gol kii lakeer hoti he, jiske aage das-das gaz ke oundzon hote hai, yani kul milakar maidan kii lambaai 120 gaz hoti he
 There is a streak called Yardline at every five Gaz distances in the field
 har oundzon ke akhir main zamin se 10 foot kii oonchaai par do khambe hote hai jinhen "goalpost" kaha jaataa he
 Every team can have 11 players on the field at any time, but teams have the right to change one or all of their players at any given time in the game
 isliye footbaal ek visheshgy khilaadiyon kaa khel he
 In any team, there are actually many players, which are divided into three types: the attacking player, the defending player and the special player
 kuch khilaadi to tiimon main sirf isliye rakhe jaate hai ki agar unke hi hunar vaale kisi khilaadi ko chot lag jaae to unhen unke sthaan par daalaa ja sake
 In most cases, many players of any team do not get the chance to get into the field
 jis team ke paas gend par qabza ho, use "aakraamak" bulaayaa jaataa he or jis ke paas na ho use "rakshak" bulaayaa jaataa he
 The most important player on the offensive team is called the quarterback
 jab akramak or rakshakon main bhidnt shuru karti he to isi kaa kaam he ki tezi se maidan kaa muina karke faisalaa kare ki akramak team kaa koun-sa khilaadi gend ko rakshak team ke oundzon kii taraf badhaane ke liye sabase acchhee sthiti main maujuud he
 Then the quarterback tosses the ball to him, or himself runs away and tries to push the ball forward
 khel kaa puraa samay ek ghanta hota he, jise chaar 15 minute ki chauthaiyon main baanta jaataa he
 The second quarter is followed by a 12-minute break
 khelte hue kai baar gend ruk jaati he or tab khel kii ghadi bhi roak di jaati he
 a quarter of 15 minutes can actually take more than 45 minutes, and a full one-hour game can actually run more than three hours
 jab khel television par prasaarit hota he to in antaraalon main prasarankarta ishtehaar dikhaate hai
 At the beginning of the match, the coin is tossed and a team is declared an offensive team and they are given the ball
 ab 50 gaz kii lakeer par donon timen ek dusre se bhidane ke liye aamane-saamne lakeeren banaakar khadi ho jaati hai
 The quarterback of the offensive team stands behind his team
 maahaul thik aisa hota he ki do gut jang ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hon
 The game begins when the ball reaches the hands of the offensive quarterback
 foran rakshak team ke khilaadi us tak pahunch kar use dhane kii ziddo-jahad main lag jate hai
 Some aggressive players try to stop them by confronting them, while the rest of the aggressors enter the opponent's field and try to put themselves in a good position to move the ball forward
 quarterbaque ke paas kuch hi kshan hote hai jisamen use faisalaa karnaa hota he: kis saathi ko gend phenken yaa phir khud rasta dhundta hua aage bhaage
 In a few moments, the defending players of the count, who defend him, reach the quarterback by banging or pushing them
 agar gend quarterbaque ke haath main ho or use daboch diya jaae to ise "sac" kehete hai or kisi bhi quarterbaque ke liye yah bahut sharmnaak mana jaataa he
 Being sacked more often means that the quarterback was unable to think between skirmishes: he is weak and not capable of leading the aggressors
 chaahe quarterbaque gend kisi ko phenke, chaahe khud use lekar bade, aam taur se rakshak thodi hi duuri par gendwale aakraamak khilaadi ko dha hi lete hai or gend ruk jaati he
 This condition is called down
 aakraamakon kaa kaam he kii 4 dounon main gend ko kam-se-kam 10 gaz badhayen
 If they cannot do so, the defenders are taken possession of the ball and the defenders now become aggressive and the offensive defenders
 gend kaa qabza tab bhi badal jaataa he agar kisi aakraamak ke haath se khelte hue gend chhot jaae or koi rakshak us hilti hue gend ko pakad le yaa phir quarterbaque kisi anya aakraamak khilaadi ko gend phenke or koi rakshak bich main aakar use pakad le 
 In the event of a fumble or interception, the defender who has caught the ball may immediately start running towards the opponent's endzone and run until it is dropped, pushed out of the ground, or he Do not score points for your team by reaching the endzone
 jab gend ruukti he to yah bade dhyaan se mapa jaataa he kii 100 gaz ke maidan main yah kaunse gaz par he
 The next play is started in the middle of the field at the same Ghaz
 is jagah ko "bhidane kii lakeer" kaha jaataa he
 As stated, the aim of the offensive team is that the ball moves 10 yards in four or less downs
 farz kijiye ke ve do hi dounon main gend ko 10 gaz aage badha len
 So it is said that he is again on the first down and now he has to raise the ball 10 yards in four downs again with this new scrimmage streak
 yah silsilaa tab tak chalata he jab tak aakraamak rakshakon ke oundzon tak na pahunch jaaen yaa galati karke virdohi ko gend kaa qabza na de den
 Players are also changed in the game which is interrupted when the occupation is changed
 bahut se aakraamak khilaadi daudane main or phenki gai gend pakadaney main nipun hote hai or aksar unke sharir halake hote hai
 Many defenders are terrific and most offensive-specific players are difficult to pick up if they are caught or slammed
 acha aakraamak vahi he jise quarterbaque dwaara phenki gai gend ko bina galati ke pakadana aata ho or jo bhaagate hue rakshakon ko chakma dete hue dushman ke kshetra main dur tak gend badha sake
 The job of some aggressors is to take on defenders so that others can take the offensive ball forward
 inkaa naam hi "oinsive tekal" hota he

 But later, during the reign of King Akhenaten of the 18th dynasty, the Egyptian kingdom began to waver and he lost many of his provinces, Akhenaten abandoned the traditional religion of ancient Egypt and started worshiping God named Aten and declared it a national religion
 Due to which chaos spread in Egypt

 Siriya was then under the 18th dynasty but had gone under the Hittite empire
 misr samrajya ke khoye hue praant ko jitne ke liye rameces ne kadesh par hamalaa kiya jo ki syria kaa ek nagar tha
 Ramesses' father, Seti I, had conquered Kadesh during his reign, but at the last time of the reign of Seti I, Kadesh again came under the Hittite empire
 yah bhi yuddh kaa kaaran tha
 The Ramesses attacked Kadesh from the south in the 5th year of his reign
 vahiin hittite raja muvatalli ne apane padausi rajya ke saath milakar misr kii sena ke viruddh ek sangh bana liya tha
 Muwatalli deposited his army in Kadesh and sent his detectives to Ramesses, those spies told Ramesses that they were far from Kadesh
 san 1274 isapurv main rameces apni sena ke saath apni rajdhani pi rameces se kadesh kii taraf bada, uski sena amun, raa, set or pitaah naam kii chaar tukadio main vibhajit thi, ek or choti tukdi thi naarin naam kii jiskaa adhik ullekh nahin he
 Apart from the Egyptians, the army of Ramesses also had people from Kanan, Syria, Nubia etc
 rameces kai ratho kaa nirmaan karaayaa, itnaa kii itihaaskaar sirf andaaza laga sakate hai
 Regarding Muwatalli's army, Ramesses writes that Muwatalli had called an army of 19 neighboring states against Ramesses
 rameces apane lekh main likhvata he ki vah apni sena ke saath kadesh kii taraf bada, rameces amun tukdi main tha
 He first reached the hills of Kadesh, then crossed the river Orontes and reached the city of Kadesh
 amun tukdi rameces ke peeche thi, raa tukdi paas hi ke kazbe main thi, pitaah tukdi dakshin ke ek kazbe main thi or set tukdi sadak raste aa rahi thi
 When Rameses was 11 km away from Kadesh, he found some Banjaras who were actually Muwatalli's undercover, telling Rameses a lie that Muwatalli is afraid of the pharaoh and Hatti army is afraid to come here, Hatti army is in the land of Aleppo Which is 200 km from here
 par baad main jab un banjaaron kii pitayee kii gayi to unhone sach kabuula or bataaya kii muvatalli kii sena paas hi main he
 The entire Hatti army simultaneously attacked the Egyptian army
 rameces ne apni sena ko tukadio main baat diya tha or ve ek dusre se kaaphi dur thi, hathi sena ne sabase pehle raa tukdi par hamalaa kiya or use laghbhag nasht kar diya, bache hue yoddha kisi kadar amun tukdi tak pahoche
 Ramesses sent the message to the fathers and the set troops, but by then the Hatti army had reached the Amun unit
 hathi ratho ne amun tukdi kii suraksha diwaar tod daali or unhen maarna shuru kar diya
 Ramesses writes in his article that he was surrounded by the Hatti army, he had no bodyguard or any warrior
 phir rameces ne morcha sambhala or kai sesainik ko maar giraaya, phir kai amun or raa tukdi ke bache hue yoddha apane raja ko bachaane aa gaye
 Many warriors of the Hatti army went to plunder the Egyptian camps, and the survivors were fighting the Ramesses and the remaining Egyptian warriors
 rath or dhanush ke sahare misr sainik ne kaaphi hathi sesainik ko haraa diya
 The Ramesses had a good opportunity and attacked the unsuspecting Hatti army which was looting, the Ramesses drove the Hatti soldiers across the Orontes River
 hathi sena ke khadede jane ke baad bhi muvatalli ne dubaara ek badi sena bheji, us sena main kai rath, paidal sainik the jo nagar kii diwaar ke bheetar the
 The Hatti army again reached the Egyptian camp, but suddenly the Narine troops attacked, the Hatti army was stunned
 tab tak rameces ne apni puri sena jamaa kar lee or hathi sena par hamalaa bol diya
 Now the Hatti army was surrounded and almost destroyed, the remaining Hatti soldiers reached Kadesh somehow
 agle din dubaara yuddh shuru hua, rameces likhvata he ki muvatalli ne use yudhviram sandhi ke liye bulawaaya tha, par hittite lekh main iskaa koi ullekh nahin miltaa
 The Egyptian soldiers failed to demolish the walls of Kadesh, and Muwatalli also failed to drive out the Egyptian soldiers, while the victory seemed to be in his favor

 Outlining the limits of revivalism, he wrote in one of his articles that- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise Captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false

 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, pedophilia is a paraphilia in which a person becomes imaginative towards emotional and recurrent sexual urges towards young children and after which he either realistically fulfills it or causes distress
 Or mutual problem occurs

 The word is derived from the Greek: παιδοφιλία παῖς, which means child and φιλία means "friendly love" or "friendship"
 In modern times, "child love" or "child lover" is used for pedophiles and is widely touted as romantic or sexual attraction
 
 Infantophilia, or napiophilia, is used to refer to sexual interest towards infants and young children

 The term pedophilia erotica was coined in 1886 by the Viennese psychiatrist Richard von krafft-ebing in his Psychopathea Sexualise work

 kraft-ebbing describes several types of offenders, basically dividing them into psychopathological and non-psychopathological and speculating several obvious reasons that could lead to child abuse
 craft-abing ne "manovaigyanik yon vikruti" ke ek prakaar main peedophilia irotica kaa ullekh kiya he
 He wrote that he had faced this only four times in his career and gave a brief description of each case, which has three common characteristics: unhone peedophilia se grasit vayask mahilaon ke kai maamalon kaa ullekh kiya he or samalangik purushon dwaara ladakon ke saath durupyog ko atyant durlabh mana he
 To further clarify this, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or neurological disorder and abuse with children do not have pedophilia and they are monitored by men who are adults and children
 
 unhone isse sambandhit sudopedophilia ko bhi suchi main rakhaa he, jisamen "hastmaithun ke madhyam se ve vyakti jo kamechha ko kho dete hai or baad main apni yon bhukh ke liye bacchon kii ore aakrishth ho jate hai, ise unhone sabase saamaanya lakshan mana he
 In 1908, the Swiss neuroanatomist and psychiatrist Auguste Fourl wrote about the phenomenon, proposing "pterosisi" as "sexual appetite for children"

 This includes the presence of imagined, sexual behavior arising out of behavior or solicitation in which sexual activity with a child of a young age lasts for about six months or longer, and for such desires patients suffer from these urges or distress

 The diagnosis of the patient is further specified based on the sex of the child, if there are limited functions to impulse or incest and if "attraction" is "special" or "non-special"

 It can be diagnosed based on the presence of imagination or sexual urges, even if no such activity has ever happened

 a large-scale survey of the use of various classification systems revealed that DSM classification is rarely used

 Ray Blanchard reviewed his literature for DSM-5, noted the objections and proposed to apply a general solution to the pedophile patient, that is, the difference between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder
 The latter term is proposed to identify a clinical condition that meets both criterion a and B, whereas a person who does not meet criterion b can determine, but cannot be diagnosed Is, since he has paraphilia

 However, o'donohue has taken the issue in a different direction, suggesting instead that diagnostic criteria alone may be simpler for children to lure if self-reports, laboratory findings, or past behavior To be traced He states that any sexual attraction towards children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, commenting that "this sexual attraction has significant potential to harm others and is also not in the person's best interests

 In a 1993 review of child sexual abuse, Sharon Arazi and David Finkelhor said that due to undeveloped research related to the field, there is a lack of standardization in the use of the term "pedophilia" among researchers due to "technical problems" 
 unhone do paribhaasha kaa varnan kiya, ek "pratibandhaatmak" rup jo ki majboot or vishesh bacchon main yon ruchi ke saath logon kaa zikr kiya gaya he or ek "samgr" paribhaasha kaa varnan kiya gaya he, is shabd kaa vistaar kiya gaya he or vaise aparaadhiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he jo anachar sahit ek bachche ke saath yon sampark main lage hai
 He said that he used a broad definition in his critical article so that practical criteria could be easily identified and complex analysis was not required for an individual's intention

 However, these observations do not include pedophilia from a group of mental disorders because pedophilic action causes harm

 a perpetrator of child sexual abuse is usually accepted as a pedophile although there are other motivations for this crime
 As child sexual abuse may or may not indicate pedophiles, offenders can be divided into two types: special and non-special
 According to a US study on 2429 male pedophile offenders, only 7% were identified in the special category, suggesting that the majority of offenders fall into the non-special category

 Others, such as those who often exploit children, use a complex variety of methods to obtain children, such as gaining trust from the parents of children, purchasing children from other pedophiles or, often, non-industrial Obtaining kidnapped children from unknown persons from countries
 Pedophiles often show interest in children in order to achieve child interest, honesty, and avoid others not knowing their child abuse by children

 While these results are relevant to prevent child abuse offenders from committing crimes again, there is no empirical suggestion of a cure to cure pedophilia
 Dr
 Fred Berlin, founder of the Sexual Disorder Clinic, Johns Hopkins, believes that pedophilia can be treated successfully if the medical community focuses more on it
 Castration, either physical or chemical, is quite effective in dissociating such sexual impulses when the attacker is driven by libido, which seems to be extremely effective in eliciting it, but this method is not recommended when drive is an expression of anger
 Or the need for power and control
 Chemical and surgical castration has been used in many European countries since World War II, although to a lesser extent, Nazi Germany was also employed to some extent
