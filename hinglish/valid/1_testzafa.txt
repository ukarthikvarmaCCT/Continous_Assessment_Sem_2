 In Sanskrit there is a verb 'kshayati' i
e
 'he reigns', from which in the old Persian language the word 'khayayathiyya' was formed from the verb
 yahi 'khshaaynteey' shabd iran ke hakhaamani samrajya ke shilalekhon main miltaa he
 Its Sanskrit homogeneous word is 'kshatri' from which 'kshatriya' is formed
 pracheen farsi main 'samrajya' ko 'kshastra' kehete the, jo sanskrit ke 'kshetra' ke baraabar he 
 In modern Persian, 'shah' of 'kshayathiyya' and 'city' of 'kshayathatra' has become
 shahar kaa matlab 'samrajya' se ghatakar 'nagar' rah gaya he haalanki ise kabhi-kabhi pracheen matlab ke saath bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he, masalan 'iran shahar' kaa matlab 'iran kaa samrajya / raashtra' he

 In Sanskrit the word for its equality is 'jat' or 'jata' and in Hindi 'jaya', as seen in words like 'newborn'
 hindi main 'shahzada' ko 'shah kaa jaaya' kaha jayega or agar sakht sanskrit nazariye se dekha jaae to 'shahzada' sanskrit ke 'kshatriyajaat' kaa sajaateey he
 In Persian, the word 'banu' means 'woman' and 'shahbanu' means 'royal woman', a name used to mean a lot of women in the Indian subcontinent

 The reasons for which the equilibrium, or health, of various parts of the body are destroyed and distortions occur in them, are called causative and their science is called etiology
 ye kaaran anek hai
 They are divided into the following parts: ye hetukikaarak jis prakaar se vikrutiyon ko utpann karte hai, usko rogajanan kehete hai
 The pathologies that occur in different parts of the body due to pathological causes are known as pathologies and the description of the metal organ or intent with these deformities is called the deformed body and the pathology of these deformities is pathology or pathology
 vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy vividh rogakaarakon se vibhinn ango main jo vividh vikrutiyaan utpann hoti he, unka kaaryakaaran bhav pradarshit karnaa he
 The main purpose of pathology is to give an explanation of the gross and subtle forms of those deformities and to clarify the symptoms arising from various diseases based on them
 yah uddeshy vividh vyaadhiyon se mrit vyaktiyon ke sampurna itihaas ke saath, maranottar pareekshan se unke sharir ke vibhinn dhatvashayadi angon ke bheetar paae janevaali vikrutiyon, kaa mail kiye bina siddh nahin ho saktaa
 Post mortem for pathology was introduced in Western countries in the 16th - 17th centuries
 morgagni ne san 1761 main uske purv kiye gaye saikadon shavpareekshanon kii chaanvin kar, unamem se saat sau shavpareekshanon ke vrittant ko brihad sangrah granth ke teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya
 In this treatise, the extent to which the signs and symptoms found in various organs of patients correlate with the anatomical malformations found within their bodies
 iske pashchaat hi vikrutivigyaan ko swatantra astitv praapt hua
 Rudolph Fikhons began using the microscope in the 19th century to test for physiologic malformations and published his treatise on cellular pathology in 1846 AD
 is granth ne rogon ke swaroop kii tathaa unke abhyas ke liye koun-cone se saadhan prayukt hone chahie or prayukt ho sakate hai, inke sambandh kii kalpana main kranti paidaa kii tathaa vikruti vigyaan ko, jo pehle roganidan ke antargat ek chota sa vishay tha, nidaan kaa ek uttam adhishthan bana diya
 Despite the latent malformations in the body parts, the reaction, swelling, renovation, growth inhibition, degeneration, tumor, etc
 are some common types of Ini-guinea
 sharir ke bheetar in vikrutiyon kaa swaroop jab aasaani se indriya grahya hota he, tab usko sthool vikruti kehete hai tathaa sookshm swaroop kii vikruti hone par in vikrutiyon ko dekhne ke liye jab sookshmdarshi yantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab usko sookshm vikruti kehete hai
 Deformations emphasize the heterogeneity of various body parts and their anatomical and morphological changes and their functional changes in diseases
 saransh main vikrutiyon kaa ullekh vibhinn angon se sambandhit hota he or rog kaa ullekh adhiktar lakshanon se sambandhit hota he
 The disease remains in the form of malformations in the body from long ago
 keval vah bahut sookshm hone se indriyagrahya kam hokar buddhigrahya adhik hota he
 When complete body deformities and their causes are described according to the above general types, then it is called normal pathology and when each organ, intention or institution of the body is described independently of the above types of deformities
 Is, then it is called special pathology
 prayogshaala ke andar vibhinn parikshaon se rogi ke rog kaa adhyayan clinical pathology dwaara kiya jaataa he
 General pathology is divided into the following chapters
 aadhunik vichaarak yah maanate hai ki sujan, sajiv sharirastha koshikaon ke dwaara kisi bhi kshobh ke virodh main kii gai pratikriya maatr he
 There are four reasons for the outbreak: sujan ke pramukh chihn nimnlikhit hai : Along with this, there is a loss of activity of the organ due to some shock in the tissues and due to some colic
 sharir kaa nirmaan karanevaale vibhinn utakon ke ke hraas, vinaash tathaa kshati ko saamaanya oothkakshay kehete hai
 Causes - The following are the major causes of tissue tissue saransh main oothkakshay kaa mukhya kaaran dhamni, shiraaon tathaa keshikaon main avrodh kaa hona he
 Due to this, nutritious substance does not reach the said place
 oothkakshay ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai : It is also a tissue-specific action
 jab kisi utak kaa apakarshan kaha jaataa he, to iskaa abhipraay utak main ek vishesh prakaar kaa parivartan samajhnaa chahie, jaise vasa apakarshan kehane se kisi ootkavishesh main vasa kii upasthiti he, aisa bodh hota he, usee ke anusaar namakaran bhi hota he, jaise hriday apakarshan, mansapeshiy apakarshan, yakruti apakarshan ityadi
 In other words, when there is a change in the chemical activity of the cell due to lack of nutritious diet of tissues, it is called detraction
 isamen koshika kii purnataya mrityu ho jaati he tathaa uske protoplasm se ek nae prakaar ke rasinic padaarth kii utpatti hoti hai
 This substance is completely different from the previous structure of the cell and thus the function of the cell is completely different
 jab koshika ke andar lasika main se ek vishisht padaarth nikalakar ikattha ho jaataa he, to use ant:spandan kehete hai
 This infusion is mainly adipose, calcareous and amyloid type, whereas ablation is fatty mucoid and colloid
 rakt ke abhaav se jab utak main ek prakaar kii sadan hone lagati hai, to use koth kehete hai
 It is of two types dry koth and humid
 shushk koth - jab kisi ek bhaag kii dhamni dwaara kisi ang main rakt pahunchnaa band ho jaataa he, to shushk koth kii utpatti hoti he
 Humid dictionary - In this, the movement of blood from the veins by a particular organ towards the heart stops completely
 rakt kii us sthaan par aamad hoti he, parantu nikaas nahin hota
 Apart from the above two types of coaths, there are other types of coaths as well, such as intercostal coath, infectious coath, pneumothritis, diabetes mellitus, senescent coath, and renal disease
 jeern yaa vinasht hue utak yaa koshikaon kii kriya yathasambhav pun: praapt kii jaae, is abhipraay se jo unka punarjanan hota he, vah punarnirmaan, yaa jirnoddhar kaha jaataa he
 It is such a special state of the body in which there is growth of body tissue
 saamanyat: arbud do prakaar ke hote hai : Soft tumors - These are fatal because they do not cause any harm to life
 ghaatak arbud- jin arbudon main vighatan atyadhik hota he, unamem utak kii si akruti nahin banati
 Their composition is different from that of tissue and their growth is very rapid
 ve sharir main shighratapurvak prasaarit hokar andar hi andar swasth avyavon ko aakraant karte hai
 The action of this internal transmission is called metastasis
 is kaaran ye bahut maarak bhi hote hai or isi se inhen ghaatak, dusht, yaa chand arbud kaha jaataa he
 When there is an attack of any pathogenic bacteria in the human body, then the nature inside the body resists them the most, and in this war, the body's thick cells protect the body from disease by destroying the force of those external bacteria
 sharir ke andar se utpann isi roganashak shakti ko pratiraksha kehete hai
 There are two types of immunity: swaabhaavik pratiraksha - kisi rog ke pratirodh main sharir ke andar jo swaabhaavik shakti utpann hoti he use swaabhaavik pratiraksha kehete hai
 Earned immunity - If a person does not have the resistance to a particular disease and retrospectively by himself or by any other measures, he can be called acquired immunity
 udaahranarth, haija, chechak, motitora, titains ityadi paidaa karanevaale kuch rogaanu aise chote hai jo ek baar sharir main pravesh karne par rog paidaa kar sakate hai, parantu thodi maatra main pravisht karne par rog ke prati pratiraksha shakti utpann karte hai
 The reason for this is that a toxin produces disease in the body due to excessive intake, but the same toxin creates immunity by staying in very small amounts

 Chloroform or trichloro methane is an organic compound, whose chemical formula is chcl3
 yah ek rangahin or sugandhit taral padaarth hota he jise chikitsa kshetra main kisi rogi ko shalya kriya kiye jane ke liye moorchhit karne hetu nishchetak ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Under anesthesia, the doctor giving the anesthetic has three important purposes, the first is to bring the patient to a fainting position for surgery, and to bring him back to a healthy state
 iske baad doosraa kaam rogi ko dard se chhutkaaraa dilaanaa tathaa teesraa kaam shalya-chikitsak kii aavashyaktaanusaar rogi kii mansapeshiyon ko kuch dhilaa karne kaa prayaas karnaa hota he
 In the initial period, all the above three works were done with the same anesthetic i
e
 ether or chloroform, but due to less or more amount of chloroform, the patient could not get the desired results safely, due to which many research in medical science continued and today Due to the progress made in this field, the desired result as desired by the effect of different drugs to the patients through balanced anesthesia
 There arise
 vartmaan chikitsa main iskaa prayog band kar diya gaya he
 Today, chloroform is used in making chemicals and soaps etc
 iskaa nirmaan ithenul ke saath chlorine kii abhikriya karaane ke baad hota he
 It is toxic and therefore should be used with caution
 chloroform ke adhik nearesth prayog rahane se sharir ke kai angon par bura asar pad saktaa he
 Chloroform was originally discovered in July 1831 by American physicist Samuel Guthrie, and a few months later independently by German chemists Eugene Söbern and Justus von Liebig
 in sabhi ne helloform abhikriya ke antaran prayog kiye the
 Soberan produced it by the reaction of chlorine bleaching powder on acetone and ethanol
 chlorofarm kaa namakaran or kairectorseshan 1834 main jin-baptist dumas ne kiya tha
 The discovery of chloroform as a sterile experiment was done by James Young Simpson, a doctor in Edenburgh
 sempson kaa janm 7 june 1811 ko ednabura se 23 kilometre dur bathget naamak sthaan par ek hua tha
 His father was a very ordinary man with very little income
 sempsan padhne likhane main bahut hi hoshiyaar the har baat ki lagan thi un main sirf 14 saal ki umr main unhone ednabura vishwavidhalay main daakhila le liye tha or maatr 18 saal ki umr main apni doctori ki padhai purna kar lee thi
 The history of its discovery is also interesting
 chloroform kii khoj ednabura ke ek doctor ne kii thi
 Once in his hospital, a patient was tied with a rope to perform a poor leg operation
 uski taang main ek ghaav ho gaya tha jo sad chukaa tha uski taang kaatani padi thi
 When his leg was amputated, the patient became unconscious due to pain
 uske saath hi doctor sempson jo us vakt padhai kar rahe the vah bhi behosh ho gaye
 When he regained consciousness, he vowed that he would invent something that does not hurt the patient so much
 jab unhone is ke bare main apane saath padhne vaale mitron se baat kari tab sab ne unka majaak banaaya par unhone himmat nahi haari
 Even after becoming a doctor, he did not forget his pledge, he continued the search of this medicine, so that no patient could suffer pain during the operation
 4 navambar 1847 ko koi prayog karte samay unki nazar apane sahyogi doctor par padi jo unki banaayi ek dawa soongh rahe the or dekhte hi dekhte vah behosh ho gaye
 Sempson looked at him with his own sniff and he had the same condition as that of his associate doctor
 tabhi unki patni vahaan ai or yah dekh kar cheekh uthi or kisi or doctor ne doctor sempson kii nadee dekhi vah thik chal rahi thi usee samay doctor sempson ne aankhe khol di or hosh main aate hi vah chillaaye ki mil gaya, behosh kar ke dubaara hosh main aane kaa nuskhaa mil gaya
 Later many changes were made in this and this medicine proved to be a boon for patients
 chloroform kaa chikitsa jagat main prayog 1847 se hi aarambh ho gaya tha, kintu jald hi rogiyon par iske padane vaale vipareet prabhaav ke kaaran iske prayog par shankaaen uthne lageen thim
 In the early twentieth century, chloroform was replaced by safer and cheaper drugs
 aaj chikitsajagat main anya dawaaon ke saath-saath helothen, isofluren or sevofluren kaa prayog iske sthaan par kiya jaataa he
 The adverse effects of chloroform on the body can affect the liver, kidney and heart
 iske kaaran twachaa par salawatein or dhabbe pad sakate hai
 In addition to severe diseases like gastroentitis and diarrhea due to high amount of chloroform in the water, infection can also spread
 chloroform sunghane se bhi bachanaa chahie, jisase behoshee bhi aa sakati he or adhik maatra ke prabhaav se mrityu bhi ho sakati he
 In some places people also drink chloroform found in water
 chloroform pani main saralata se ghulansheel hota he
 Acting with oxygen and sunlight, it produces a toxic gas called phosgene
 lekin yadi chloroform ko khule main le jaaya jaae to fosgin hanirahit ho jaati he
 Isopanishad Shukla is a Upanishad under the Yajurvedic branch
 yah upanishad apane nanhen kalevar ke kaaran anya upanishdon ke bich behad mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 There is no story in it, only self-description
 is upanishad ke pehle shloke ‘‘eshavasyamidansarvanyatkinch jagatyaan-jagat


’’ se lekar atharahawein shloke ‘‘agne nay suptha raye asman vidhwani dev vaunani vidvan


’’ tak shabd-shabd main maanon brahm-varnan, upasna, prarthana aadi zankrut he
 There is only one voice - of Brahman, of knowledge, of self-knowledge
 adbhut kalevar vaale is upanishad main ishwar ke sarvanirmaataa hone kii baat he saare brahmad ke maalik ko ingit kiya gaya he, satvik jeevanstyli kii baat kahi gai he ki duusare ke dhan par drushti mat daalo
 While living in this world, we have been told to live lifelessly
 isamen ‘asurya’ naamak lok kii baat aati he — asurya matlab ki surya se rahit lok
 The world where the sun cannot reach, the ultimate world filled with thick, dark darkness, that is, the womb
 kaha gaya he ki jo log aatm ko, apane ‘swa’ ko nahin pahachaanate hai, aatma ko jhuthla dete hai, nakaar dete hai or isi asweekaar tale puraa jivan bitaate hai unhen mrityu ke pashchaat usee andhtam lok yani ki asurya naamak lok main janaa padataa he arthath garbhavas karnaa padataa he, phir se janm lenaa padataa he
 Thus in this Upanishad, on the one hand, considering God as the Creator, on the other hand, indicates to live life by becoming a mere instrument, which on the other hand indicates not to forget self
 iske baad aatm ko nirupit karne kaa tathy aata he ki ‘vah’ achal he saath hi man se bhi zyada tivrgami he
 This self is a fast escape from all senses
 is upanishad main aatm / brahm ko 'maatarijva' naam se ingit kiya gaya he, jo ki sabhi kaaryakalapon ko vahan karne vaala, unhen sambal dene vaala he
 In order to describe the qualities of Brahma of 'atma', it is here that he is simultaneously, at the same time, wandering, as well as intransitive

 huyek or katz donon liter, vinodi tatwon or gaharaa, nindaneey tatwon ko shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 Katz explains that some readers were confused with the sexual elements of the screenplay, as they were unsure whether the film was made for adults or children

 The child actor found the shooting situation difficult to handle, and the film's editors failed to match the day and evening sequences due to differences in the two portrayals
 kyonki gail ne bhi ek community ke rup main kaam kiya, unhone bhoomika nibhaai After the film was completed, Huayake and Kataj auditioned John Cusack, Jason Alexander, and Martin Short for Howard's voice, eventually casting Chip Zien, as they felt his oral voice would do well for the part Works
