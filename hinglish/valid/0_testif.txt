 It was later claimed that, in one of those multilingual puns so beloved by men of science in the 19th century, he was also named after Gallium himself, for "le Coq" for "cock" and "cock" The Latin word for is "gallus"
 ek 1877 lekh main, Lecoq is anumaan se inkaar kiya he
 Originally, de Boisbaudran determined the density of gallium as 4
7 g / cm3, the only property that failed to match Mendeleev's predictions; Mendeleev then wrote to him and suggested that he should remeasure the density, and de Boisbaudran then obtained the correct value of 5

 do kos kii yatra ke baad uski gaadi kaa ek pahiyaa tut gaya
 From there both started the journey on foot
 On the way, when the wife is thirsty, the moneylender sits under a tree and goes to get water
 thodi der baad jab wo kahin se jal lekar waapas aayaa to vah buree tarah hairaan ho uthaa, kyonki uski patni ke paas uski hi shakl-surat kaa ek doosraa vyakti baitha tha
 The wife was also surprised to see the moneylender
 vah donon main koi antar nahin kar pai
 sahukaar ne us vyakti se poocha- tum koun ho or meri patni ke paas kyon baithe ho
 sahukaar kii baat sunakar us vyakti ne kaha- are bhai, yah meri patni he
 i have brought my wife away from her in-laws, but who are you who are questioning me like this? This is my wife
 main ise ped ke neeche baitaakar jal lene gaya tha
 On this, the person said- Oh brother, you are telling lies
 i went to get water when my wife was thirsty
 main to jal laakar apni patni ko pilaa bhi diya he
 Now you should not walk quietly from here or else you will call a soldier and catch you
 Both of them started fighting with each other
 Seeing them fighting, many people gathered there
 nagar ke kuch sipaahi bhi vahaan aa gaye
 The soldiers took them both and took them to the king
 sari kahani sunakar raja bhi koi nirnay nahin kar paaya
 The wife also could not recognize her real husband from both of them
 raja ne un donon ko karagaar main daal dene ko kaha
 raja ke faisle ko sunakar asli sahukaar bhaybheet ho uthaa
 tabhi akashwani hui- sahukaar tuune mata-pita kii baat nahin maani or buudhvaar ke din apni sasuraal se prasthaan kiya
 All this is happening due to the wrath of Lord Buddha
 sahukaar ne bhagwaan budhdev se prarthana kii ki he bhagwaan budhdev mujhe kshamaa kar dijie
 mujhase bahut badi galati hui
 bhavishya main ab kabhi buudhvaar ke din yatra nahin karuunga or sadaiv buudhvaar ko aapkaa vrath kiya karuunga
 sahukaar kii prarthana se prasann hokar bhagwaan budhdev ne use kshamaa kar diya
 tabhi doosraa vyakti raja ke saamne se gaayab ho gaya
 The king and others were surprised to see this miracle
 bhagwaan budhdev kii anukampaa se raja ne sahukaar or uski patni ko sammanpurvak vidaa kiya
 On walking some distance, they found a bullock cart on the way
 baiylgaadee kaa tutaa hua pahiyaa bhi judaa hua tha
 Both of them sat in it and walked towards the city
 Both the moneylender and his wife began to live happily on Wednesday
 Due to the blessings of Lord Buddha, wealth and wealth started to rain in his house
 Soon there was happiness in his life

 If a coin has only one metal, both metal and coinage are equally important, so that no harmful impurities are entered into the metal, which can severely affect, or become popular with, the metal's performance and properties in many stages of coin manufacturing
 On the go, there is a difference in the properties of the coin
 kaansa, tanba-nikal, nikal-pital or rajat kii mishradhatu se bharat main sikke banate rahe hai
 The use of pure nickel began in 1946, when the use of silver in coins was slowly being eliminated

 There are two methods of estimation of copper, the volumetric method and the weighted method
 isamen taapan dwaara mishradhatu yaa sikke ke tule hue bhaag ko tanu nitric amla main villin kiya jaataa he
 The solution is almost dried by evaporation at the end of the reaction and the coin piece is completely dissolved
 kaanse kaa sikaa hon par, utmukt tin aanksaide ko chaanakar, jal se bhalee prakaar dho lete hai or vilyan yaa chhanit main itnaa ammonium hydroxide milaate hai ki vah alp ammoniamay ho jaay
 This solution is then mixed with solid potassium iodide, or its concentrated solution, which releases iodone
 starch vilyan ko suchak banaakar unmukt iodine ke saath maanak sodium thayosulphate se anumaapan karte hai
 By this method, we standardize sodium thiosulfate by calibrating pure electrically analyzed copper
 isamen sikke yaa mishradhatu ke tule hue pariman ko tanu salphurik or nitric amla ke mishran main villin karte hai
 If necessary, the solution is filtered when the alloy is completely dissolved, and by diluting it, placing a platinum wire and a platinum wire inside it, connecting the battery's debt and the money poles to the electrolyte of the solution
 vilyan kaa tanba gaanz par sanchit hota he
 After the accumulation is complete, after washing the marble with water and alcohol, it is dried and weighed

 In this, the weighed quantities of the alloy or coin dissolve in dilute nitric acid, if necessary, by heating
 mishradhatu ke purnataya villin hone par vilyan ko garam dhaatu patt par rakhkar, kuch sandra karke evam pun- tanu karke, phir se use garam dhaatu patt par rakh dete hai, taaki utmukt tin aanksaide neeche baith jaae
 a small pulp of filter paper is filtered in tin oxide and stirred well with one percent nitric acid until the filtrate is free of copper
 avakshep ko sukhaane ke baad, porcillen kii tuli hui musha main prajvalit karke thandha kar taulate hai
 The percentage of tin in the coin or alloy is known by the weight of tin oxide thus obtained
 yadi sikke yaa mishradhatu main tanba or tin ho, to use alag karne ke baad avshisht vilyan main upasthit nikal kaa bharmetiya aganan mimnlikhit prakaar se kiya jaataa hai
 In the form of di-methyl gly-oxime salts, the coin or alloy is merged into the acid in a suitable manner
 vilyan kii uchit maatra ko tanu karke tanu ammonium hydroxide ke mishran se halkaa kshareey banaate hai
 The solution is heated and the alcohol solution of the di-methyl-gly-oxime is added to the hot solution with excess, leaving the nickel as a red compound
 iske baad vilyan ko ammonium hydroxide dwaara spasht kshareey banaakar, garam dhatupatt par jamane ke liye rakh chhodte hai
 After this, by filtering and washing the red yogurt in a weighed perforated mustache, till the weight becomes stable, 1200-1250 cm

 Electrical decomposition estimation - Nickel like copper can also be electrically evaluated
 sikke yaa mishradhatu ke tule hue ansh se, yadi ho to tanba or tin alag karke or vilyan ko teevr ammoniamay karke, usamen ammonium sulphate milaate hai
 As described under copper electrodynamic determination, the entire nickel of this solution accumulates on the cell's negative platinum band
 is prakaar sanchit nikal ke bhaar se mishradhatu main nikal ke pratishat kii gananaa kii jaati he
 After separating copper, nickel, etc
 from alloys or coins, they are invited for zinc

 Hydrogen sulfides in the solution flow a rapid stream of gas, causing zinc sulfide to precipitate
 avakshepan puraa hone par vilyan ko thodi der ke liye rakh chhodte hai or phir use chaanakar avakshep ko pani se acchhee tarah dhote hai
 The precipitates burn with caution in the bent porcelain mustache after drying, which turns into sulfide oxide
 praapt zinc oxid ke bhaar se mishradhatu, yaa sikke, main jaste ke pratishat kii gananaa kar lete hai
 Although now the use of silver in Indian coins has completely ended and pure nickel has replaced silver in the coins which used to be the main metal silver before 1946, yet the method of silver extraction used in Indian mints
 It is necessary to mention

 The base transceiver station, or BTS, contains the equipment for transmitting and receiving of radio signals, antennas, and equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications with the Base Station Controller
 The base transceiver station, or BTS, includes devices for transmitting and receiving radio signals, antennas, and for encrypting devices and decrypting communications with the base station controller
 Typically a BTS for anything other than a picocell will have several transceivers which allow it to serve several different frequencies and different sectors of the cell
 Normally anything from one picocell to another is a BTS multiple transceivers which would allow it to serve many different frequencies and different regions of the cell in the case of sectorised base stations
 a BTS is controlled by a parent BSC via the Base Station Control Function
 The BCF is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations
 is BCF ek asatat ikai ke rup main yaa karyanvit kiya jaataa he bhi compact base steshnon main ek TRX main shaamil kar liye hai
 The BCF provides an operations and maintenance connection to the Network Management System, and manages operational states of each TRX, as well as software handling and alarm collection

 The advantage in this case is less load on the expensive Abis interface
 In this case, this advantage is low on the load to the expensive Abis interface
 The btss are equipped with radios that are able to modulate layer 1 of interface Um; for GSM 2G+ the modulation type is GMSK, while for EDGE -enabled networks it is GMSK and 8- PSK

 Antenna combiners are implemented to use the same antenna for several trxs, the more trxs are combined the greater the combiner loss will be
 Antenna combiners are applied to use the same antenna for multiple trxs, the more trxs are used the more damage will occur to the combiner
 Up to 8: 1 combiners are found in micro and pico cells only
 8: 1 combiners are found at the top and pico cells are only microscopic
 Frequency hopping is often used to increase overall BTS performance; this involves the rapid switching of voice traffic between trxs in a sector

 This increases the traffic capacity of the base station whilst not greatly increasing the interference caused to neighboring cells
 This increases the traffic capacity of the base station can carry eight voice channels, greatly interfering the neighboring cells to any direction
 Typically two antennas are used per sector, at spacing of ten or more wavelengths apart
 Two antennas are generally used in spacing other than ten or more wavelengths, according to region
 This allows the operator to overcome the effects of fading due to physical phenomena such as multipath reception 
 yah oparator bhautik ghatana ke liye multipath swaagat jaise kaaran fading ke prabhaavon ko dur karne ke liye anumati detaa he

 The BSC handles allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from the mobile phones, controls handovers from BTS to BTS
 The BSC handles the allocation of radio channels, the measurements received from mobile phones, control handovers from BTS to BTS
 a key function of the BSC is to act as a concentrator where many different low capacity connections to btss become reduced to a smaller number of connections towards the Mobile Switching Center
 Overall, this means that networks are often structured to have many bscs distributed into regions near their btss which are then connected to large centralised MSC sites

 The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 created as a result of this constituted a federal responsibility to implement interstate law
 The Justice Department made no effort to address its staff shortage until the turn of the century, when Attorney General Charles Joseph Bonaparte contacted other agencies, including the Secret Service, to arrange for investigators
 lekin congress ne is sandarbh main 1908 main ek kanoon paarit kar nyaay vibhaag dwaara rajasav karmchaariyon ke is tarah ke prayog se manaa kar diya

 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya

 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 In fact, many scholars have expressed their views regarding his birth, but the views of 'shiv Singh Sanger' and 'george Grierson' seem more expedient and valid, on the basis of which the composition of Sudama Charit was not in 1582 AD
 1582 means Samvat 1636

 rajasi poshaaken, aabhushan, tun kii lakdi kii baarik nakkashi vaale bade-bade daravaaje or chhaton main lage jhaad-phanus mahal kii shobhaa main chaar chand lagaate hai
 In Dussehra, there is an exhibition of throne made of 200 kg pure gold
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki yah pandavon ke jamaane kaa he
 The walls of the palace have a live depiction of the tableaux that emerge on the occasion of Dussehra
 praveshdwar se bheetar jate hi mitti ke raste par dahini ore ek counter he jahaan camera or cellphone jamaa karnaa hota he
 Near the counter is a temple decorated with gold vases
 duusare chor par bhi aisa hi ek mandir he jo dur dhundla sa nazar aata he
 There are temples at both ends, which is on the way of mud and on the opposite side is the main building of the palace and in the middle is the garden
 andar ek vishaal kaksh he, jiske kinaaron ke galiyaaron main thodi-thodi duuri par stambh he
 These pillars and roof have fine golden carvings
 deevaaron par kram se chitra lage he
 Details are written on each picture
 krishnaraja wadiyaar parivaar ke chitra
 Pictures of Yajnopaveet Rites of King IV
 vibhinn avasaron par liye gaye chitra
 Pictures of Rajatilaka
 sena ke chitra
 Pictures by the king listening to the public's request
 ek chitra par hamane dekha prasiddh chitrakaar raja ravi verma kaa naam likhaa tha
 Almost all the paintings were made by Ravi Varma
 kaksh ke bichon-bich chat nahin he or upar tak gumbad he jo rang-birange kaanchon se bana he
 These colorful glass were chosen to properly transport sun and moon light to the palace
 nichle vishaal kaksh dekhne se pehle tal tak sidhiyaan itani chaudee ki ek saath bahut se log chadh saken
 The first floor was a place of worship
 yahan sabhi devi-devataaon ke chitra lage the
 At the same time there were pictures of Yajna and worship performed by Maharaja and Maharani
 bich kaa gumbad yahan tak he
 On the second floor is the court court
 bich ke bade se bhaag ko chaaron ore se kai sunahare stambh ghere hai is ghere se baahar baayein or daayen golakaar sthaan he
 Probably the Queen and other ladies of the court used to sit and on the other side the public complaint was heard because the outer ground was visible from here and there are also the stairs on both sides to go outside, which is now fenced
 
 isi tal par pichley bhaag main ek chote se kaksh main sone ke teen singhaasana he - maharaja, maharani or yuvaraj keliye
 In the last days of the week, during the holidays and especially in Dussehra, the palace is decorated with lights in such a way that even though the eyes are dazzled but the eyes do not want to turn away from them

 He has been in the presidency since 2004, when he defeated Megawati Sukarnoputri in the presidential election
 goswami tulsidas hindi sahitya ke mahaan kavi the
 He was born in Soron Shukrakshetra, present-day Kasganj Uttar Pradesh
 kuch vidvan aapkaa janm rajapur jila baandaa main hua maanate hai
 He is also considered an incarnation of Maharishi Valmiki, the author of the Adi Kavya Ramayana
 shriramcharitamanas kaa kathanak ramayana se liya gaya he
 Ramcharitmanas is a folk book and it is read with great devotion in North India
 iske baad vinay patrika unka ek anya mahatvapurn kavy he
 The epic Sriramacharitamanas was ranked 46th among the world's 100 best popular poetry
 adhikansh vidwaan tulsidas kaa janm sthaan rajapur ko maanane ke paksh main hai
 Although some also consider it as the Soro Sukkshetra
 rajapur uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot jila ke antargat sthit ek gaanv he
 There lived an eminent Sarauparin Brahmin named Atmaram Dubey
 unki dharmapatni kaa naam hulsi tha
 Tulsidas was born here in the same nakshatra moola nakshatra on the seventh day of the bright fortnight of Shravan month of Samvat 1511
 prachlit janashruti ke anusaar shishu baarah maheene tak maan ke garbh main rahane ke kaaran atyadhik hrisht pusht tha or uske mukh main daant dikhaayi de rahe the
 As soon as he was born, he pronounced the name Rama, which gave him the name Rambola
 unke janm ke duusare hi din maan kaa nidhan ho gaya
 The father handed over the child to a maid named Chuniya to avoid any further evils and disabused himself
 jab rambola saade paanch varsh kaa hua to chuniyaan bhi nahin rahi
 He was forced to live like an orphan wandering the streets
 bhagwaan shankaraji kii prerana se ramshail par rahanevaale shri anantanand ji ke priy shishy srinaraharyanand ji ne is rambola ke naam se bahucharchit ho chuke is balak ko dhund nikaala or vidhivat uskaa naam tulsiram rakhaa
 Thereafter, he took him to Ayodhya and performed his yagyopavit-sanskar there in 1561 Magh Shukla Panchami
 sanskaar ke samay bhi bina sikhaaye hi balak rambola ne gayatri-mantra kaa spashth uccharan kiya, jise dekhakar sab log chakit ho gayi
 After this, Narhari Baba, after performing the five rites of Vaishnavas, gave the child the initiation of Ram-mantra and made him study while staying in Ayodhya
 balak rambola kii buddhi badi prakhar thi
 What he would hear from Guru-mukha in one go, he would become memorized
 vahaan se kuch kaal ke baad guru-shishy donon shukarakshetra pahunche
 There Narhari Baba narrated the story of Rama to the child but he did not understand it well
 jyeshtha shukla trayodashi, guuruuvaar, sanwat 1583 ko 29 varsh kii aayu main rajapur se thodi hi dur yamuna ke us paar sthit ek gaanv kii ati sundari bharadwaj gotra kii kanya ratnavali ke saath unka vivaah hua
 Since Gauna was not done, he went to Kashi for some time and stayed there with Seshasanatan ji and started studying ved-vedang
 vahaan rahete hue achaanak ek din unhen apni patni kii yaad aayi or ve vyakul hone lage
 When he was no more, he returned to his birthplace Rajapur with permission from Guruji
 patni ratnavali chunki maayke main hi thi kyonki tab tak unka gauna nahin hua tha at: tulsiram ne bhayankar andheri raat main ufanti yamuna nadi tairkar paar kii or sidhe apni patni ke shayan-kaksh main ja pahunche
 Ratnavali was surprised to see her husband alone that night
 usne lok-lajja ke bhay se jab unhen chupchaap waapas jane ko kaha to ve usase usee samay ghar chalane kaa aagrah karne lage
 Fearing his unexpected stubbornness, Ratnavali taught him through a couplet composed by Tulsiram, which made him Tulsidas
 ratnavali ne jo doha kaha tha vah is prakaar he: Hearing this couplet, he left his wife's house there at the same time and returned back to his village Rajapur
 rajapur main apane ghar jaakar jab unhen yah pataa chalaa ki unki anupasthiti main unke pita bhi nahin rahe or puraa ghar nasht ho chukaa he to unhen or bhi adhik ksht hua
 He paid obeisance to his father lawfully and started living in the village and narrating the story of Lord Rama to the people
 kuch kaal rajapur rahane ke baad ve pun: kaashi chale gayi or vahaan kii janata ko ram-katha sunaane lage
 During the story, he found a phantom in the guise of a man, who told him the address of Hanumanji
 hanuman ji se milakar tulsidas ne unase raghunathji kaa darshan karaane kii prarthana kii
 Hanumanji said- "you will see Raghunathji in Chitrakoot
 " is par tulsidas ji chitrakoot kii ore chal pade
 After reaching Chitrakoot, he set his posture at Ramghat
 ek din ve pradakshina karne nikle hi the ki yakaayak maarg main unhen shriram ke darshan hue
 He saw that two very handsome princes were riding on horses and carrying bows and arrows
 tulsidas unhen dekhakar aakarshith to hue, parantu unhen pahchaan na sake
 Then when Hanumanji came from behind and told him the whole secret, he started to repent
 is par hanumanji ne unhen satvana di or kaha praatavkaal phir darshan honge
 Lord Shri Ram reappeared in front of them on Wednesday on the Mauni Amavasya of Samvat 1607
 unhone balak rup main aakar tulsidas se kaha-"baba! hamen chandan chaiye kya aap hamen chandan de sakate hai?" hanuman ji ne sochaa, kahin ve is baar bhi dhokhaa na kha jaayen, isaliye unhone tote kaa rup dhaaran karke yah doha kaha: Seeing that wonderful image of Tulsidas Shri Ram, he forgot his own mind and mind
 antatogatva bhagwaan ne swayan apane haath se chandan lekar apane tathaa tulsidas ji ke mastak par lagaaya or antardhyaan ho gayi
 In Samvat 1628, he took Hanuman's orders and proceeded towards Ayodhya
 un dinon prayag main magh mela laga hua tha
 They stayed there for a few days
 parv ke chah din baad ek vatvriksh ke neeche unhen bharadwaj or yajyavlky muni ke darshan hue
 There had been the same story, which he had heard from his master in Sukrkshetr
 magh mela samaapt hote hi tulsidas ji prayag se pun: waapas kaashi aa gayi or vahaan ke prahladghaat par ek brahman ke ghar nivas kiya
 While living there, poetry-power emerged in him and he started writing poetry in Sanskrit
 parantu din main ve jitne padya rachate, raatri main ve sab lupt ho jate
 This incident happens every day
 aathven din tulsidas ji ko swapn hua
 Lord Shankar ordered them to compose poetry in their own language
 tulsidas ji kii neend uchat gayi
 He got up and sat down
 usee samay bhagwaan shiv or parvati unke saamne prakat hue
 Tulsidas ji prostrated him
 is par prasann hokar shiv ji ne kaha- "tum ayodhya main jaakar raho or hindi main kavy-rachana karo
 With my blessings, your poem will flourish like Samveda
 " itnaa kahkar gaurishankar antardhan ho gayi
 Tulsidas ji, following his orders, went straight from Kashi to Ayodhya
 sanwat 1631 kaa prarambh hua
 In that year yoga came on the day of Ram Navami in the same way as it was on the day of Rama's birth in Tretayuga
 us din praatavkaal tulsidas ji ne shriramcharitamanas kii rachana prarambh kii
 This wonderful book was completed in two years, seven months and twenty six days
 sanwat 1633 ke margshirsh shuklapaksh main ram-vivaah ke din saaton kand purna ho gayi
 After this, Tulsidas came to Kashi by the command of God
 vahaan unhone bhagavan vishwanath or mata annapurna ko shriramcharitamanas sunaaya
 At night the book was kept in the vishwanath-mandir
 praat:kaal jab mandir ke pat khole gayi to pustak par likhaa hua paaya gaya-satyam shivan sundaram jiske neeche bhagavan shankar kii sahi thi
 At that time, the people present there also heard the voice of "satya Shivam Sundaram" with their ears
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ko jab yah baat pataa chali to unke man main irshyaa utpann hui
 They started making a team and condemned Tulsidas ji and tried to destroy that book
 unhone pustak churaane ke liye do chor bhi bheje
 The thieves went and saw that two youths were guarding the bow with a bow around the Tulsidas ji's hut
 donon yuvak bade hi sundar kramash: shyaam or gaur varna ke the
 As soon as they saw him, the thieves' intelligence became pure
 unhone usee samay se chori karnaa chhod diya or bhagwaan ke bhajan main lag gayi
 Tulsidas ji looted all the things of his life and suffering for God, and kept the book with his friend Todarmal
 iske baad unhone apni vilakshan samaran shakti se ek duusari prati likhi
 On the basis of this, other copies were prepared and the promotion of the book started increasing day by day
 idhar kaashi ke panditon ne or koi upaay na dekh shri madhusudan saraswati naam ke mahapandit ko us pustak ko dekhakar apni sammati dene kii prarthana kii
 Madhusudan Saraswati ji was very happy to see him and wrote his comment on it - iskaa hindi main arth is prakaar he-"kaashi ke anand-van main tulsidas saakshaat chalata-phirata tulsi kaa paudha he
 His poetry is very beautiful, on which the temple of Shriram always hovers
 " The Pandits were also not satisfied with his comment
 tab pustak kii pariksha kaa ek anya upaay sochaa gaya
 In the Vishwanath-temple of Kashi, the Vedas were placed at the top in front of Lord Vishwanath, the scriptures under them, the Puranas under the scriptures and the Ramcharitmanas under them
 praatavkaal jab mandir kholaa gaya to logon ne dekha ki shriramcharitamanas vedon ke upar rakhaa hua he
 Now all the priests were very ashamed
 unhone tulsidas ji se kshamaa maangi or bhakthi-bhav se unka charanodak liya
 When Tulsidas ji started living on the famous ghat Aseighat of Kashi, one night Kali Yuga came to him in physical form and started tormenting him
 tulsidas ji ne usee samay hanuman ji kaa dhyaan kiya
 Hanuman ji appeared visually and asked him to create a prayer post, after which he wrote his last work Vinaya Patrika and dedicated it to the feet of God
 shriram ji ne us par swayan apane hastakshar kar diye or tulsidas ji ko nirbhay kar diya
 Shravana Krishna Tritiya on Saturday in 1680, Tulsidas ji gave up his body, saying "ram-ram"
 tulsidas ji kii hastlipi atyadhik sundar thi lagata he jaise us yug main unhone calography kii kala aati thi
 a copy of the Ayodhyakanda of Sriramcharitmanas is preserved in a temple of his birthplace, Rajapur
 usee prati ke saath rakhe hue ek kavi madanlaal verma 'krant' kii hastlipi main tulsi ke vyaktitv va krititv ko rekhaankit karte hue nimnlikhit do chand bhi ullekhneey hai jinhen hindi academy dilli kii patrika indraprastha bharti ne sarvapratham prakashit kiya tha
 The first verse in these is the overview, which is the feature that each step begins with the word that ends with it
 pratham va antim shabd bhi ek hi rahata he
 It has been called a wonderful verse in poetry
 yahi chand ek anya patrika sahityaparikrama ke tulsi jainti visheshank main bhi prakashit hue the vahiin se uddhrut kiye gayi hai In his long life span of 126 years, Tulsidas composed the following classics in chronological order - inamen se ramcharitamanas, vinay-patrika, kavitawali, gitavali jaisi kritiyon ke vishay main kisi kavi kii yah arshvani sateek prathit hoti he - pashy devsy kavyan, na mrinoti na jiryati
 That is, see the poetry of devpurus, which does not die or become old
 lagbhag chaar sau varsh purv tulsidas ji ne apni kritiyon kii rachana kii thi
 Even in that period devoid of modern publishing facilities, Tulsidas's poetry had reached the masses
 yah unke kavi rup main lokapriy hone kaa pratyaksh pramaan he
 By reading a large book like Manas, the normal educated people were also becoming famous for their purity and knowledge
 ramcharitamanas tulsidas ji kaa sarvaadhik lokapriy granth rahaa he
 He has not mentioned anything in relation to his works, hence there is a lack of in-depth evidence regarding authentic works
 nagari prachaarini sabha kaashi dwaara prakashit granth is prakaar hai : Grierson also mentions the first twelve texts above in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics
 yah sanskaar geet he
 Certain references in this song are different from the story of ram-vivah
 vairaygy sandipani ko mataprasad gupt ne apramanik mana he, par acharya chandravali pandey ise pramanik or tulsi kii aarambhik rachana maanate hai
 Solid evidence can be found by the availability of some more ancient copies
 sant mahima varnan kaa pehla soratha pesh he - Scholars have declared it a creation of Tulsi
 style kii drushti se yah tulsidas kii pramanik rachana he
 Only a fragmented copy of it is edited in the bibliography
 yah tulsi kii pramanik rachana prathit hoti he
 Its poetic maturity is compatible with the Tulsi theory
 kavita saral, subodh rochak or saras he
 "" Jagat Matu Pitu Sambhu Bhavani "" is not even a little bit of the aesthetic efforts
 lok reeti itani yathasthiti se chitrit hui he ki yah sanskrit ke shiv kavy se kam prabhavit he or tulsi kii mati kii bhaktyaatmak bhoomika par virachit katha kavy he
 The poet has carefully noted the solidity of behaviors, the exclusivity of love, and the plausibility of the matrimonial program
 tulsidas apni is rachana se atyant santusht the, isiilie is anasakt bhakt ne keval ek baar apni mati kii saraahna kii he - Scholars have placed it in the authentic compositions of Tulsidas
 par isamen bhi kshepak he
 Before the Tulsi Manas, the story of Valmiki Ramayana was popular
 kaashi ke panditon se maanas ko lekar tulsidas kaa matbhed or maanas kii prati par vishwanath kaa hastakshar sambandhi janashruti prasiddh he
 This astrology is the scripture of the classical method
 dohon, saptakon or sargon main vibhakt yah granth ramakatha ke vividh mangal evam amangalamay prasangon kii mishrit rachana he
 In terms of poetry, the importance of this book is negligible
 sabhi ise tulsikrut maanate hai
 It lacks a story-series and the translations of the Valmiki Ramayana are translated into several couplets
 dohavali main adhikansh dohe maanas ke hai
 The poet has written devotions and love by writing a long series of couplets from the Vyasa of Chatak
 dohavali doha sankalan he
 Some non-fiction couplets of Manas also have a place in it
 sambhav he kuch dohe isamen bhi prakshipt hon, par rachana kii apramanikta asandigdh he
 Kavitavali is a work of Tulsidas, but this composition published in the Sabha edition or other editions does not seem complete
 kavitawali ek prabandh rachana he
 Irrelevance and laxity in the plot will be called the stigma of Tulsi's art
 gitavali main geeton kaa aadhaar vividh cond kaa ramcharita hi rahaa he
 This book seems to have been reduced to widespread public relations like Ramcharitmanas
 isliye in geeton main parivartan-parivardhan drushtigat nahin hota he
 The narrative-references to the songs in Gitavali are in line with Tulsi's mati
 is drushti se gitavali kaa ek geet liya ja saktaa he - In this, Tulsidas has expressed the exaltation of the modesty of Bharata and Rama
 gitavali ke uttarkand main maanas kii katha se adhik vistaar he
 In this, Sita is sent to Valmiki Ashram
 is parityag kaa auchity nirdesh in panktiyon main miltaa he - Shri Krishna Geetwali is also the creation of Goswamiji
 shrikrishna-katha ke katipay prakaran geeton ke vishay hai
 This is a Hanuman-devotional work of Goswami Ji
 par yah ek swatantra rachana he
 All parts of it seem authentic
 tulsidas ko ram pyaare the, ram kii katha pyaari thi, ram kaa rup pyaara tha or ram kaa swaroop pyaara tha
 Rama's dignity and lila were dominated by his intellect, raga, imagination and sentimentality
 unak ankhon main ram kii chhavi basati thi
 Everything is expressed in Rama's holy leela, the highest achievement in the tradition of Ramkavya
 nirdisht granthon main iskaa ek ras pratibimb he

 adhikansh bhashaaon main do vachan hi hote hai- ekvachan tathaa bahuvachan, kintu sanskrit tathaa kuch or bhashaaon main dwivachan bhi hota he
 There are two words in Hindi- shabd ke jis rup se ek hi vastu kaa bodh ho, use ekvachan kehete hai
 Such as boy, cow, soldier, child, cloth, mother, garland, book, woman, hat, monkey, peacock etc
 shabd ke jis rup se anekta kaa bodh ho use bahuvachan kehete hai

 It was chaired by the Austrian politician Metternich
 congress kaa mukhya uddeshy francisi krantikari yuddh, nepolian yuddh or pavitra roman samrajya ke vighatan se utpann hone vaale kai muddon evam samasyaon ko hal karne kaa tha
 Napoleon was exiled to the island of St
 Helena after the defeat of Waterloo, then in 1815 the victorious powers of Europe gathered in Austria's capital, Vienna
 uddeshy tha, europe ke us maanchitr ko punarvyavasthit karnaa jise nepolian ne apane yuddh or vijayon se ulat-patal diya tha
 In fact, Austria's Chancellor Metternich was instrumental in building a front against Napoleon, so on his initiative the Congress was called in Vienna, the capital of Austria
 is sammelan main europe ke kai chote-chote desh shaamil hue kintu niti nirmaan ke sambandh main chaar mukhya deshon ke pratinidhiyon kii bhoomika mahatvapurn rahi
 These leaders were Austria's Chancellor Maternick, Russia's Tsar Alexander, England's Foreign Minister Lord Castlere and French Foreign Minister Tailra

 Napoleon demolished the whole of Europe with his Holocaust warfare

 The winners of Waterloo were anti-revolution who had been destroyed

 The Vienna Congress was started with this aim
 jisamen 19veen shatabdi ke europea rajvyavastha kii aadhaar shila rakhi gai thi
 The Prime Minister of Austria, Metternick, was the major hand in defeating Napoleon
 ve mahaan raajnneetijna the
 Due to them, the conference of the Vienna Congress was held in Vienna, the capital of Austria
 iskaa pratham adhiveshan 15 sitambar 1814 ko hi aarambh ho chukaa tha
 The conference included the ruler of the Tsar Alkjender i of Prussia, Friedrich William III of Austria, the Tellerna of France, Metrénique, Austria, and the Foreign Minister of England, Lord Castlere, etc
 In which all the minor rulers of Europe except Turkey were present
 congress kii samasya- The Vienna Congress had many problems
 sarv pratham nepolian ke yudhon ke chalate europea maanchitr main kaaphi parivartan aa gaya tha
 The question of the restoration of these states before the Vienna Congress was the second problem was to suppress the revolutionary spirit
 carch kaa prashn bhi bahut badi samasya thi
 The members of Vienna wanted to reestablish the Church's influence
 chauthi samasya yuddh kii sambhaavna ko samaapt karnaa tha taaki pun: nepolian jaisaa koi shaktishaalee vyakti paidaa nahin ho sake
 Rewarding the conquered nations was another problem
 vienna congress ke siddhant evam uddeshy- The Vienna Congress had some principles for the solution of the above mentioned problems which are as follows
 shakti santulan kaa siddhant- Its main principle was the balance of power, that is, Holland could be extended to Switzerland, Baberia and Serdinia to ban France, so that no country could become so powerful as to become dangerous to others
 france chaaron taraf se majboot rajyon se ghir gaya
 In the same way, Germany was made so powerful that the administration could not lift the head
 italy main austria kii sthapit kii gai is prakaar shakti santulan sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 So that power may remain at peace throughout Europe
 vaidhata kaa siddhant- On the basis of this principle, the European map of 1789 was adopted by accepting the boundaries and attempting to demarcate various European states
 holland, purtegal, neples, tathaa italy aadi rajya anek puraane rajvansh ko lautaa diya gaya
 Principle of Damage Supply is siddhant ke anusaar jin deshon ko nepolian ne nasht kiya tha or jinhone uske khilaaf sangharsh kiya tha
 It was accepted to compensate and reward them
 jin deshon ne nepolian kaa saath diya tha
 He was punished
 france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee bananaa-iskaa chauthaa siddhant france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee banaaya jaae taaki france antarrashtriya shakti ko bhang nahin kar sake
 Apart from the above principles, it had other principles
 shanti- samjhauta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye iske peeche bhi shakti honi chahie
 Thus, England, Austria, Russia and Russia gave rise to the European system as a result of this principle of the four-pronged treaty
 vienna congress ke nirnay evam pradeshik vyavastha- The territorial system it established had the following objectives
 jin deshon ne nepolian ko haraane main hissaa liya tha unhen puraskaar or jo parajeet hue the unhen dand milanaa chahie
 In Europe, the system before the revolution should be implemented
 jisase europea vyavastha kaa nirmaan ho or shanti tathaa suraksha kaayam rakhaa ja sake
 The states that Napoleon included in France were taken away
 or france main pracheen rajvansh ko phir se sthapit kiya gaya
 England had colonial and trade benefits
