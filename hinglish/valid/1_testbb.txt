 ye kahani karigar allaah rakhaa siddiki (allah Rakha Siddiqui) kii he, jo purakhon se mandiron main anuthi nakkashi kaa kaam karte hai
 Because of working in the temple of Allah Raya, Muslims do not consider it a Muslim and to go to the temple, Allah Raya has to apply a red spot on the forehead so that Hindus consider it Hindu
 allaah rakhaa ke paas ek betaa he mohammad jisase wo behad pyaar karata he or ek dost he samad jisaki kahani saath-saath chalati he
 Allah Rakha Siddiqui is played by actor Inamul Haque, while the son's role is child artist Harminder Singh

 The writer and director of the film Nakash, Zaigham Imam, has made a very sincere attempt to make the film which is screened
 ye film bataati he ki kis tarah samaaj main nafrat fail rahi he or is nafrat ko failaane vaale log koun hai? or kyon failaai ja rahi he dharm ke naam par ye ghrinaa
 The film's theme and story as well as its screenplay are good which bind the film
 film ke samvaad behad prabhaavshaalee hai
 Many scenes in this film are emotional and show the mirror of society
 is film main sabhi kirdaaron ne acha abhinay kiya he
 The acting of Inamul Haq (inaamulhaq) has made this film extremely impressive
 'nakqaash' main bal kalakar harminder singh (harminder Singh) ne bhi acha abhinay kiya he
 Sharib Hasmi has filled many colors in his role
 mandir ke pujari ke kirdaar main kumud mishra (kumud Mishra) hai
 The film has a good start, although at some places the film slows down a bit
 is film main samad kii kahani bhi saath-saath chal rahi he jo apane pita ko haj bhejne ke liye paise iktthe kar rahaa he
 Both these tracks are well combined in the film
 haalanki haj kaa mudda dikhaane kii vajah se ye film asal mudde se bhatki mahasoos ho rahi he
 In today's era, the film 'nakkash' fits perfectly
 aaj logon main dharm ke naam par nafrat fail rahi he
 This film shows that Allah and God who make humans do not differentiate between anyone but humans themselves make a difference in each other
 is film ke dwaara samaaj ko ye sikh di gai he ki raajnneetidharm se nahin balki karm se kerani chahie
 This film made by Jagam Imam is about to open your eyes
 isliye is film ko hamaari taraf se 3 star die ja rahe hai

 But Saif believes that he has gone to the Pataudi dynasty

 wo kapur or pataudi donon kaa mishran he
 i think this journey is going to be awesome

 film main anupam kher ek aise baap hai jo apane bete ko har tarah se saport karata he
 The scene in the film where Anupam asks his son Shahrukh to bring his love home is very funny

 Apart from DDLJ, Anupam and Shah Rukh have worked together in Darr (1993) and Chahat (1996)

 The Daddy Cool song of this film was a big hit

 ) uttar pradesh main shamali jile ke kairana kshetra main hui police muthbhed main ghayal sipaahi ankit tomars kaa buudhvaar der raat noida ke fortis aspataal main nidhan ho gaya
 Shaheed Ankit Tomar was given a final farewell with state honors amid the slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai in a crowd of thousands at Shamli police line on Thursday
 upi sarkaar ne shahid ankit tomars ke parijanon ko 50 lakh rupee kii aarthik madad dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, while praising the valor and courage of martyr soldier Ankit Tomar, has announced financial assistance to his family members
 40 lakh shahid kii patni or 10 lakh unke mata-pita ko die jaaenge
 At the same time, Anand Kumar, Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, Uttar Pradesh has appealed to the officers and employees of the State Police to give one day's salary to the dependent of the martyr
 mangalvaar ko badmaash sabir se hui muthbhed main ankit ke sir or chaati main goli lag gai thi
 He went into a coma due to a bullet in his brain
 unhen ventilator par rakhaa gaya
 Senior doctors of the country tried their best to get the bullet fired in Ankit's brain, but could not succeed
 muthbhed main sabir maaraa gaya tha
 Let us tell you that Ankit, a resident of Wajidpur of Baraut, Baghpat, was admitted to the UP Police in the year 2011
 saal 2012 main unki shaadi hui thi
 They have a five-month-old son and a four-year-old daughter
 unke pita jaipal ne bataaya ki ankit unki teen santanon main sabase bade the
 He has a younger sister and a brother
 rajdhaniyon par hameshaa andhere kii ek chadar hoti he or yah baat dilli ke maamle main kahin zyada lagu hoti he
 You cannot recognize the changing trend of the winds with the help of things flying in the sky
 uske liye aapako gaanvon kii ore janaa hoga jahaan asli voter rahata he or vahaan kii deevaaron par likhi ibaaraton ko padhuya hoga
 In Delhi, just need to sniff the air a little more carefully and pause a little
 agar aapako bhaanpane kaa tajurba he or aapke dimag kii khidkiyaan khuli hai, to badlaav aap mahasoos kar paaenge
 Every change, however, is not for the better, even if it is justifying your point, so that you can claim that, look, i said no! When the sand of royalty was slipping from the fist of UPA-2 and The round was between 2010–12 when others had a chance to dance on his administrative ground
 us daur main maine dekha tha ki kaise is desh kii teen sansthaaen nyaaypalika, media or naagarik samaaj apni-apni chadar se baahar pair pasaarne ke aadi ho gaye the
 At that time there was a competition among the three to grab the vacant space of the executive
 yah apekshit bhi tha kyonki vyavastha ko khalipan se hameshaa nafrat hoti he, lekin yah aswabhaavik bhi tha kyonki der-saver karypalika ko apni jagah waapas leni hi thi
 This has happened now and as i said, all three have been directly caught by the neck
 is saptaah teen aisi ghatnaon kii ore dhyaan diya janaa chahie jo aapas main judi nahin hai or alag-alag kshetron se hai
 First, the Chief Justice of the country surprised everyone by suddenly praising the Prime Minister
 shuruyaat main isaki dabi jabaan main aalochana hui, phir mukhar awaajen sunne main ain
 The second incident is unexpected enough to prevent Priya Pillai, a senior worker at the Greenpeace organization, from going on a trip to London even though she was not legally barred from traveling abroad
 iskaa kuch virodh bhi hua lekin vah activist samudaay tak simit rahaa
 The third incident is related to filmmaker Pankaj Butalia who appealed to the Supreme Court against the censor board banning his documentary on Kashmir and the court bench remarked at the hearing without giving any relief to him, "why is this film unilateral The i do not know why one-sided talk has become a fashionable and human rights issue nowadays
 ’’ sawaal banataa he ki agar isse kahin zyada ekatarfa paksh bharat sarkaar kii banaai koi film rakhti tab bhi kya mananeey court ne yahi bindu uthaaya hota?in teenon ghatnaon par sawaal uthaanaa is hafte meraa uddeshy nahin he
 Actually all three events establish the initial establishment
 jaisaa ki maine kaha tha, nyaaypalika, media or naagarik samaaj, teenon ko gardan se daboch liya jayega
 These three will be obliged to vacate the place of executive on which they are encroached
 upie ke raaj main jab karypalika kamjor thi tab inhen khuli chhot mili hui thi
 They will now have to return to their old lair, but while doing so, they will have moral degradation
 yah kisi bhi loktantr ke liye to khatarnaak he hi, lekin sabase zyada khatarnaak us desh ke liye he jo jitna vividh he, utana hi bahusankhyak ke atvaad kii ore pravrutt bhi he
 After more than a quarter century, when we have such a strong executive, it should have been that these institutions would have been equally strong, but during the last few decades, if they are in the thinnest condition today, then they themselves are responsible
 bharat kaa sanvaidhanik loktantr adhikaron ke vibhaajan tathaa niyantran or santulan ke siddhanton par nirmit he
 It is a good thing that when an institution weakens, other institutions come to take its place but the work is done with humility and tolerance, believing that this system is unnatural and temporary
 sabase pehle nyaaypalika par baat karen to main isi hafte supreme court ke sabase sammanit nyaayadhishon main ek ke us bayaan (dilli main kapila hingorani smriti vyaakhyaan main tii
 s
 thakur) ko bhi sweekaar karne ko taiyaar hum ki jab prashasnic abhaav hota he to nyaaypalika ko uski jagah bharani padati he
 However i cannot say with certainty that many judges have kept themselves within this range
 is vishay par pehle bhi maine isi vajah se likhaa he jab kuch khandpithon ne garvonmatta aakraamakata dikhaani shuru kar di thi
 One told the government, "we are angry", while the other took the Prime Minister's Office in the face
 khanan patton or spectrum licenson ko thok ke bhav radd kar daalaa gaya, nirdosho or doshiyon ko ek hi lathi se haanka gaya or nai nyaayik ikaayiyon va aaraamdeh padon ko teji se sthapit kar diya gaya
 Among them is a National Green Tribunal which seems to have declared itself as the Supreme Court and the manner in which it is being pronounced (decree all vehicles 15 years old from Delhi) Should have been in Tughlakabad
 yah baat dhyaan dene kii he ki jis jaj ko pichhali sarkaar par gussa aayaa tha, usne is sarkaar se avkaash prapti ke baad ek badhibia pad sweekaar kar liya he
 When the last CJI was made Governor, the current Chief Justice praised the Prime Minister in front of the media
 jaahir he, ye unke nijee vichaar hai or unka apana mat he ki ve kise vot karen, lekin ise palat kar ek baar jaraa sochie
 If an incumbent Chief Justice felt that the Prime Minister was utterly useless and this government was unsuccessful, and had called the press at home and said this, what would have happened? i should be cautious in criticizing the Supreme Judiciary because my intention was to do so Is not there meraa sarokaar bas itnaa he ki nyaaypalika shashakt rahe, apni naitik takat ko or majboot banaae or kisi rajnatik lobh yaa dar main na aae
 The judiciary has shown its weaknesses in this case
 yahi vajah he ki nyaaypalika par karypalika kii puraani sarvocchata ko behaal karne vaala aitihaasik sanvaidhanik sanshodhan donon sadanon main 24 ghante ke bheetar paas ho gaya
 Instead of fighting it, we are now getting to hear all the praise
 yahaan ek dilachasp tathy par dhyaan dena hoga
 The top jurist who attacked this Constitution amendment and promised to challenge it in the Supreme Court is the same Fali Nariman, who has once again publicly criticized the Prime Minister's public appreciation of the Prime Minister
 yah bhi yaad rakhen ki unke paas aisa karne kaa naitik bal he kyonki bahut yuvavastha main desh ke atirikt solicytor general rahete hue unhone apni naukari kii parvaah na karke immergency ko khulkar chunauti di thi
 The situation of the media is more difficult
 jab uske liye halaat anukool the or sarkaar ko lakva maaraa hua tha, to hamen roj hi us par dhamkiyaan, upadesh, aarope vagairah sunne kii aadat-si pad gai thi
 The facts were then presented without scrutiny and arbitrarily zeroed in on the size of the scams
 managasaint kahaniyaan tak dikhaai jaati thim, jaisaa ki adarsh ghotaale ke maamle main kiya gaya or hamen bataaya gaya ki vah jameen kargil kii vidhwaaon kii thi
 Today the same media is being repeated to take selfies with the Prime Minister
 jis shashi tharur par ab tak koi aarope nahin he, hamen uske peeche padane main zyada majaa aa rahaa he jabaki hatya or balaatkaar ke dosha apane sir par liye gum rahe or samaaj ko baantne vaali ashleel bakawaas kar rahe ek bhagavadhari masakhre ko ham aise hi jane de rahe hai
 The ngos and civil society had gone on holiday under the UPA rule, and especially in its second term, they were directing the government, stopping every new project and wherever the work was not done with a straight finger, the courts resorted to Were taking kai manzooriyon ke baavjood antat niamgiri main boxite khanan par lagi roak, posco ko manjuuri ke naam par lucatipi kaa khel, brahmaputra nadi par urja sanyantron par bandish, uranium ke khanan se lekar kudankulam or anya niojit nabhikeey sanyantr yaa narmada par baandh kii oonchai ko badhaane se lekar jaev-sanwarddhit bijon ke shodh par roak tak har ladaai main activiston kii jeet hui
 They have done so much that there is no sympathy left for them now
 aaj sthiti yah he ki ki ye sari sansthaaen lagbhag moorchha kaa shikaar hai or satark hai
 Once their secret has passed, these foundation-funded institutions have not shown any great courage so far
 nandan nilekani khud upie ke aadmi the baavjood iske us dauraan sarkaar ke pasandida swayamsevi kaaryakartaaon se lekar yojana ayog main baithe kuch naukarshahon ne aadhaar card yojana ko har kadam par rokane kii koshish kii
 Today Narendra Modi's government is implementing it with full vigor under the supervision of the Prime Minister's Office and all opposition is absent
 unhone aadhaar se alpiji nakad sabsidi ko jod diya he or ek minute lambey tivi vigyapanon main puure garv se uski munaadi karte phir rahe hai
 Where are the opponents of Aadhaar now? It may be that some times a Greenpeace activist is seen opposing it, but what difference does it make
 sarkaar ne enjio ko milane vaale anudaan band kar die hai or ab janata ke bich unhen lekar koi sahanubhuti nahin bachi he
 The freedoms that exist in any democracy are also the product of the social contract that the institutions normally have with the people of the country, including the statutory provisions
 jab karypalika kamjor thi, tab nyaaypalika, media or naagarik samaaj bahut zyada taqatvar, aakraamak or avarodhi ho gaye
 Today the mandate is fixing this situation
 or yaad rakhen ki kisi bhi loktantr main janata kii raay homeopathy kii tarah komalta se kaam nahin karti
 It works ruthlessly like a surgeon's tools
 chunki ab purana saamaajik anubandh ghis chukaa he isliye nyaaypalika, media va naagarik samaaj ko khud apni raksha kerani hogi
 The situation at the moment is that these three institutions were asked to bow down and they are crawling
 isi vajah se ham inhen aise kagaji sher kehete hai jo kabhi gurraaya karte the
