 On November 2, 1957, under Section 7 of Lohia Criminal Law Amendment Act, he was arrested without any reason from the postman
 12 navambar 1958 ko lohia purvothar ke daure par nikle, jahaan unhen daura karne se roak diya gaya
 a year later, Lohia entered the northeast from Urvasium at the same place, where he was arrested
 17 april 1960 ko kanupar ke circuit house main anaadhikrut pravesh karne ke kaaran aparaadh bataakar unhen pun: giraftaar kiya gaya
 During the English Hatao Movement in 1961, Lohia's assembly was stoned in Madras
 1961 main lohia athens, rome or kahiraa gaye
 Elections in 1962 were contested against Lohia Nehru in Phulpur
 11 navambar 1962 ko kalakatta main sabha kar lohia ne tibet ke sawaal ko uthaaya
 In the 1963 Lok Sabha by-election in Farrukhabad, Lohia won the elections with 58 thousand votes
 loksabhaa main lohia kii teen aana banaam pandraa aana kii bahes atyant charchit rahi, jisamen unhone 18 karod aabaadi ke chaar aane par jindagi kaatane tathaa pradhanmantri par 25 hajaar rupye pratidin kharch karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 On August 9, 1965, Lohia was arrested under the India Security Act
 lohia jaanate the ki vidhayika, karypalika or nyaaypalika main angreji kaa prayog aam janata kii prajatantr main shat pratishat bhagidaari ke raste kaa roda he
 Describing it as a feudal language, he repeatedly warned against the dangers of its use and said that it is not the language of the workers, peasants and common people associated with manual labor
 unhone likhaa: Sadly, Lohia's English Hatao movement was seen as an attempt to establish dominance of Hindi, while Lohia repeatedly made it clear that English Hatao does not mean Hindi Lao
 unhone kshetreey bhashaaon kii unnati or unke prayog kii khul kar vakaalat kii
 According to him, the meaning of the English Hatao was 'bring mother tongue'
 bhartiya raajnneeti kaa bebaak or bindaas cheharaa rahe raamamanohar lohia ne 50 ke dashak main hi bhaanp liya tha
 In the Lok Sabha, he had emphasized and said: 30 sitambar 1967 ko lohia ko nai dilli ke wellingdon aspataal ab jise lohia aspataal kaha jaataa he ko paurush granthi ke aaparishan ke liye bhartee kiya gaya jahaan 12 oktober 1967 ko unka dehanth 57 varsh kii aayu main ho gaya
 Ram Manohar Lohia, a great freedom fighter and socialist leader who had created a reputation for non-congressism in the country, wanted socialists from all over the world to come together and build a strong platform
 lohia bhartiya raajnneeti main gaiyr congresavad ke shilpi the or unke athak prayaason kaa fal tha ki 1967 main kai rajyon main congress kii paraajay hui, haalanki centre main congress jaise-taise satta par kabiz ho paayi
 Although Lohia passed away in 1967, he went on to become the non-congress official at the Center for the first time in 1977 due to the ideology of non-congressism
 lohia maanate the ki adhik samay tak satta main rahakar congress adhinayakawadi ho gayi thi or vah uske khilaaf sangharsh karte rahe
 At the core of Lohia's concept of socialist movement was essentially the presence of thought and karma - whose idolatrous form was Dr
 Lohia himself, and his birth also provided a living example of this combination of 'karma and thought' by his conduct
 angrejon ke khilaaf bharat ke swadhinata andolan main bhaag lene vaale tamaam vyaktitvon kii bhaanti lohia prabhavit bhi the
 He also went to jail and corrected such tortures
 aazaadee se purv hi congress ke bheetar unka socialist group tha, lekin pandrah agast santalis ko angrejon se mukti paane par ve ullasit to the lekin vibhaajan kii keemat par pai gai is swatantraaa ke kaaran nehru or nehru kii congress se unka rasta hameshaa ke liye alag ho gaya
 This open play of power in the name of freedom was seen by Lohia with his naked eyes and that is why he was so angry and angry with the post-independence Congress party and Congressmen that he was better taken with both the right and the left
 There seemed to be an alternative
 swatantraaa prapti ke baad ke rajanetaaon main lohia moulik vichaarak the
 Lohia had a typical native thought about the Indian Republic
 apane itihaas, apni bhashaa ke sandarbh main ve katai pashchim se koi siddhant udhaar lekar vyakhya karne ko raji nahin the
 Rammanohar Lohia, who received his phd from Germany in 1932, called for the removal of English from the country in the sixties
 angreji hataao aandolan kii gananaa ab tak ke kuch ine gine andolanon main kii ja sakati he
 For them, self-language was not an issue of politics, but a question of their self-respect and a dream of filling millions and millions of people with inferior glands - "I would like the ordinary people of India not to be ashamed of their English ignorance, but to be proud
" is saamanti bhashaa ko unheen ke liye chhod den jinke maa baap agar sharir se nahin to aatma se angrej rahe hai
 '' halanki lohia bhi germany yani videsh se padhai kar ke aae the, lekin unhen un pratikon kaa ahsaas tha jinase is desh kii pahchaan he
 The Ramayana Mela at Chitrakoot on Shivratri was his concept, which fortunately still continues unabated
 aaj bhi jab chitrakoot ke us meley main hajaaron bhukhe nange nirdhan bharatvasiyon kii bheed swayamev jutati he to lagata he ki ye hi hai jinaki chintaa lohia ko thi, lekin aaj inaki chintaa karne ke liye lohia ke log kahaan hai? Lohia was the one who spoke of pure conduct even in the dirty street of politics
 ve ekmaatr aise rajaneta the jinhone apni party kii sarkaar se khuleam tyaagptr kii maang kii, kyonki us sarkaar ke shashan main andolankariyon par goli chalaai gai thi
 Keep in mind that this was the first non-congress government in any state in independent India - "cleanliness and well being will come in the politics of India when the people of that party condemn the bad work of any party
" xxrep 4 
 or mai yah yaad dilaa duun ki mujhe yah kehane kaa haq he ki ham hi hindustan main ek raajnneetik party hai jinhone apni sarkaar kii bhi ninda kii thi or sirf ninda hi nahin kii balki ek myne main usko itnaa tang kiya ki use hat janaa pada
 Lohia was not only a thinker, but also a performer
 unhone anek saamaajik, saanskrithik evam rajnatik aandolanon kaa netritv kiya
 During the Quit India Movement in 1942, he started a secret radio station with Usha Mehta
 18 june 1946 ko goa ko portugaliyon ke aadhipaty se mukti dilaane ke liye unhone aandolan armbh kiya
 To remove the English from India, he started the Move the English Movement
 lohia anek siddhanton, kaaryakramon or krantiyon ke janak hai
 They were biased to speak Jihad together against all injustice
 unhone ek saath saat krantiyon kaa aahvaan kiya
 These were the seven revolutions
 in saat krantiyon ke sambandh main lohia ne kaha- For all the events and situations of that time that do not have a very clear and logical explanation in the mind of a common Indian citizen, Lohia in his book 'guilty Man and India's Partition' has uncovered the mysteries
 lekin hamaara durbhaagya he ki us samay ke puure ankhon dekhe itihaas ko hi nahin, balki uske ek sakriy, jeevant paatr rahe lohia kii baton ko aaazaad bharat main sattarudh dal dwaara ek vipakshi netaa kii ‘khiz’ se zyada nahin samajhane diya gaya, jabaki sachai yah he ki satta hastantaran ke khel kii asaliyat sangrahalayon main dafan dastavejon se zyada lohia jaise netaaon ko bhi maaloom thi jise hote hue unhone apni ankhon se dekha tha
 Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia published his thoughts on many topics in the form of articles and books
 unki kuch rachanaayen hai- This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article SAP AG

 The ancient 'varanasi' name of this city was changed from Lokocharan to 'banaras', which has been officially changed to 'varanasi' by the Uttar Pradesh government
 vishwa ke sarvaadhik pracheen granth rugveda main kaashi kaa ullekh miltaa he - 'kashiritte

 aap ivakashinaasangrubhita:'
 According to the Puranas, this is the proto Vaishnavite place
 pehle yah bhagwaan vishnu kii puri thi
 Where Sriharike Anandashru fell, Bindusarovar became there and Prabhu became revered here as Bindhumadhav
 aisi ek katha he ki jab bhagwaan shankar ne cruddh hokar brahmaji kaa paanchvaan sir kaat diya, to vah unke kartal se chipak gaya
 Even after traveling in many pilgrimages for twelve years, that head did not separate from them
 kintu jaise hi unhone kaashi kii seemaa main pravesh kiya, brahmahatya ne unka peechha chhod diya or vah kapaal bhi alag ho gaya
 The place where this incident took place is called Kapalamochan-tirtha
 mahadev ko kaashi itani acchhee lagi ki unhone is paavan puri ko vishnuji se apane nity awaas ke liye maang liya
 Since then Kashi became his residence
 harivanshpurana ke anusaar kaashi ko basaanewaale bharatvanshi raja 'kaash' the
 In the opinion of some scholars, Kashi is a city even before Vedic period
 shiv kii upasna kaa pracheenatam centre hone ke kaaran hi is dharna kaa janm hua jaan padataa he; kyonki saamaanya rup se shivopasana ko purvavedikkaleen mana jaataa he
 By the way, the first mention of the residents of Kashi district is found in the Pappaladasamhita of the Artharvaveda
 shuklayajurveda ke shatapath brahman main kashiraj dhritarashtra kaa ullekh he jise shatanik satrajit ne parajeet kiya tha
 Kashiraj Ajatshatru is also mentioned in Brihadaranyakopanishad

 kaashi janapad kii pracheenta tathaa isaki sthiti in uparyukt ullekhon se spasht ho jaati he
 In the Valmiki Ramayana, the residents of Kashi and Kosal districts are mentioned together in the context of Sugriva sending Vanarasena towards the east
 mahabharat main kaashi janapad ke anek ullekh hai or kashiraj kii kanyaon ke bhishma dwaara apharan kii katha to sarvavidit hi he 
 In the battle of Mahabharata, Kashiraj sided with the Pandavas

 Kashi has been counted among the 16 Mahajanapadas of India in Angusadnikaya
 jataka kathaon main kaashi janapad kaa anek baar ullekh aayaa he, jisase gyaat hota he ki kaashi us samay vidya tathaa vyapaar donon kaa hi centre thi
 At the age of 16, the Bodhisattva is mentioned in the Atakijatak to go there and learn
 khandhhalajatak main kaashi ke sundar or moolyawaan reshmi kapadon kaa varnan he
 The best fragrant liquids are also mentioned here in Bhimsenjataka
 jatakakathaon se spasht he ki buddhapurvakaal main kaashi desh par brahmadatt naam ke rajkul kaa bahut dinon tak rajya rahaa
 It is also revealed from these stories that 'kashi' was the name of a country or district besides the city name
 uskaa doosraa nagarnam 'varanasi' tha
 Thus, the name of Varanasi gradually became famous as the capital of Kashi district and later on, Kashi and Varanasi became synonymous
 kaashi or vahaan prachlit shivopasana kaa ullekh mahabharat main bhi he– tato varanasin gatva archayitva vashadhvajam 
 The name 'varanasi' is said to have been derived from the condition of this city on the rivers Varuna and Asi

 Tatramritasiktant tena te varaye visham yuvajayajatak main varanasi ke brahmavadhan, surundan, sudassan, pupfavati or ramm evam sankhjatak main malini aadi naam milte hai
 There is a description of the moat or sapha around Varanasi in Losakjatak
 gautam buddha ke samay main kaashi rajya kosal janapad ke antargat tha

 De Moyver's theorem or d Moyver's formula is an important formula for the power of complex numbers
 iskaa pratipaadan abraham di moivar ne kiya tha
 According to this theorem, jahaan n koi purnank he tathaa x koi bhi samishra sankhya he
 The importance of this formula is that it connects complex numbers to trigonometry
 '"cos x + i sin x"' ko prayah '"cis x"' ke sankshipt rup se bhi vyakt kiya jaataa he
 De Maiver's theorem can be obtained from the formula of composite analysis
 tathaa charghaatanki ke niyam ke anusaar, So according to Euler's formula, yahan teen avasthaaen sambhav hai : Now, when writing an expression for n = k + 1: We deduce that the result is true for n = k + 1 when it is true for n = k
 By the principle of mathematical induction it follows that the result is true for all positive integers n≥1
 When n = 0 the formula is true since cos ⁡ + i sin ⁡ = 1 + i 0 = 1 { \ displaystyle \ cos + i \ sin = 1 + i0 = 1}, and z 0 = 1 { \ displaystyle z ^ { 0} = 1}
 When n < 0, we consider a positive integer m such that n = −m
 So Hence, the theorem is true for all integer values of n
 Being an equality of complex numbers, one necessarily has equality both of the real parts and of the imaginary parts of both members of the equation
 If x, and therefore also cos ⁡ x { \ displaystyle \ cos x} and sin ⁡ x { \ displaystyle \ sin x}, are real numbers, then the identity of these parts can be written as These equations are in fact even valid for complex values of x, because both sides are holomorphic functions of x, and two such functions that coincide on the real axis are necessarily coincide on the whole complex plane
 Here are the concretre instances of these equations for n = 2 { \ displaystyle n = 2} and n = 3 { \ displaystyle n = 3}: The right hand side of the formula for cos ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ cos} is in fact the value t n { \ displaystyle T_{n}} of the Chebyshev polynomial t n { \ displaystyle T_{n}} at cos ⁡ x 
 { \ displaystyle \ cos x
} This is true for a more general situation than the form described above by D
 Moyvar's sutra
 vastutah yah sutara tab bhi satya he jab z or w dono hi samishra sankhaayen hon
 Note that anek maanon vaala falan he, jabaki No

 Moyver's formula
 yadi z { \ displaystyle z} ek samishra sankhya he to ise dhruviya swaroop main is prakaar se likh sakate hai: Then jahaan k ek purnank he
 Only those values of k which are between 0 and k are taken to get n different roots of z

 shaikshik praudyogiki uchit takneekee prakriyaaon or sansadhano ke srijan, upyog tathaa prabandhan ke dwaara adhigam or kaary pradarshan sudhaar ke adhyayan or naitik abhyaas ko kehete hai
 Instructional theory and learning theory are often associated with and included with the term educational technology
 jabaki anudeshi praudyogiki main adhigam evam anudesh kii prakriyaayein tathaa pranaliyaan shaamil hai, shaikshik praudyogiki main maanviya kshamtaaon ke vikaas hetu prayukt anya pranaliyaan shaamil hoti hai
 Educational technology incorporates, but does not include, software, hardware and Internet applications and activities
 lekin in shabdon ke arth ko lekar ab bhi bahes hoti he
 Educational technology can be most simply and easily defined as an array of tools that can be helpful in the learning process of the learner
 Educational technology relies on a broad definition of the term "technology"
 praudyogiki, maanav upyog kii bhautik samagriyon jaise mashiinon yaa hardware ke rup main sanderbhit kii ja sakati he, lekin isamen pranaliyaan, sanghatham kii vidhiyaan tathaa takanic jaise vyapak vishay bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 Some modern equipment is included but is not limited to only overhead projectors, laptops, computers, and calculators
 "smartphone" or game jaise nae upkaran gambhirtha se apni abhigyaan kshamta kii vajah se kaaphi dhyaan aakarshith karne lage hai
 Those who use educational technology for conceptual discovery and communication are either learners or teachers
 maanviya kaary-pradarshan praudyogiki hastpustika par vichaar karen
 Technology means "applied science" for the disciplinary areas, academic and human performance technology
 " duusare shabdon main, vaigyanik paddati ke upyog ke dwaara moulik shodh se vyutpann koi bhi prakriya yaa prakriyaayein praudyogiki maani ja sakati hai
 Educational or human performance technology may be based purely on algorithmic or experiential processes, but neither of the two necessarily implies physical technology
 praudyogiki shabd unani shabd “techne” se bana he jiskaa arth he shilp yaa kala
 ek anya shabd "takanic" bhi usee mul se aayaa he, jiskaa upyog shaikshik praudyogiki par vichaar karte samay kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore educational technology can be expanded to include teacher techniques
 1956 kii bloom kii pustak, texonomi of ajukational ovujactivj shaikshik manovigyaan ke paath kaa ek uttam udhaaharan he
 Bloom's taxonomies, when designing learning activities, can be useful to keep in mind what the learning goals of the learners are and what is expected of them
 baharhaal, bloom kaa kaary spasht rup se swatah hi shaikshik praudyogiki se sambhddha nahin hota or shaikshanik ranneetiyon se adhik sambandhit he
 According to some, an educational technologist is one who transforms basic academic and psychological research into evidence-based applied science for learning or instruction
 shaikshik praudyogvigyon ke paas praayah shaikshik manovigyaan, shaikshik media, prayogtmak manovigyaan, sangyanatmak manovigyaan yaa adhik vishuddh rup main, shaikshik, anudeshaatmak yaa maanviya kaary-pradarshan praudyogiki yaa anudeshaatmak abhiklpana ke kshetron main snaatak oopaadhi hoti he
 But some of the theorists listed below always used the term "educational technologist" to describe themselves, preferring a term like "teacher"
 shaikshik praudyogiki ke ek kutir udyog se ek vyavsaay main roopantaran ke bare main shuraville, brown tathaa whitaker ne charchaa kii he
 The emergence of educational technology can be found in its path as very early instruments in paintings on the walls of caves
 lekin aamtaur par iske itihaas kaa aarambh shaikshik film yaa 1920 ke dashak kii sidney presse kii yantric shikshan mashin se mana jaataa he
 The first use of new technologies on a large scale can be found in training American soldiers of World War II through training films and other media materials
 aaj kii prastutikaran aadhaarit praudyogiki is vichaar par aadhaarit he ki log vishay vastu ko shravy or drishy abhigrahan se sikh sakate hai, jo anek praroopon main uplabdh he, jaise- strimming audio or video, powerpoint prastutikaran + aawaaj
 1940 ke dashak kaa ek anya rochak avishkaar hypertext, yani ve
 bush kaa memex tha
 The 1950s gave two major stable popular designs
 skinners kaary ne anudeshaatmak vishaywastu ko choti ikaayiyon main vibhajit kar, tathaa sahi anukriyaaon ko aksar jaldi puraskrit kar, "kramadeshit anudeshon" kaa vyavhaarajnya lakshyon ke sanrupan par dhyaan kendrit karnaa sambhav banaaya
 Advocating a proficient approach to learning based on the classification of his intellectual practices, Bloom supported instructional techniques that changed both instruction and timing as needed by the learner
 1970 ke dashak se 1990 ke dashak tak in diginon par aadhaarit model aam taur par computer aadhaarit prashikshan ), computer sahaytayukta anudesh yaa computer kii sahaayta se anudesh kehalaate the
 In a more simplified form, they were like today's "e-content", often the main part of "e-set up", sometimes referred to as web-based training or e-instruction
 paathyakram abhikalpak adhigam saamagree ke, graphics or multimedia prastuti ke saath sanvardhit chote-chote paath-khand banaate hai
 Multiple choice questions are added continuously with immediate feedback for self-evaluation and guidance
 aisi i-saamagree iemes, adiel / scorm or iiqui dwaara paribhaashit maanakon par bharosa karti he
 The decades of the 1980s and 1990s gave a wide variety of institutions that could be placed under the umbrella of a label computer-based education
 aksar rachnawadi or sangyaanavaadee adhigam siddhanton par aadhaarit, in pariveshon ne amoort evam prakshetra-vishisht samasya samaadhaan shikshan par jor diya
 Preferred technologies were the microcosm, simulation and hypertext
 shiksha ke kshetra main digital sanchaar or netwarking 80 ke dashak ke madhya main shuru hue or 90 ke dashak ke madhya main, visheshkar vishwavyaapee web, email tathaa manchon ke madhyam se lokapriy hue
 online adhigam ke do pramukh praroopon main antar he
 Computer-based training or computer-based learning, both of these earlier types emphasized student and computer practice and training on the one hand and student and micro-world and simulation on the other
 aaj, computer ke madhyam se sanchaar niyamit vidhyalay pranali main prachlit roopavali he, jahaan chaatr evam anudeshkon ke bich parsparik kriya kaa praathmik praaroop computer ke madhyam se he
 CBT / CBL usually means personalized learning, while CMC includes teacher / private teacher facility and requires a flexible assessment of learning activities
 iske alaava, aadhunik isiti upkarnon ke saath, adhigam samoohon or sambhddha gyaan prabandhan kaary ko banaae rakhane ke liye shiksha pradaan karata he
 It also provides tools for student and course management
 adhigam praudyogikiyaan kaksha sanvardhan ke alaava, purnakalik duurastha shikshan main bhi pramukh bhoomika nibhaati hai
 While most quality offerings rely on paper, video and occasional CBT / CBL content, the use of e-learning has increased through forums, instant messaging, video conferencing and more
 chote samoohon ko lakshyit paathyakram aksar mishrit yaa sankar abhiklpana jisamen vartmaan paathyakram mishrit hota he, kaa duurastha gatividhiyon ke saath upyog karte hai or vibhinn shaikshanik shaileyon kaa upyog karte hai
 The emergence of multiple mobile and ubiquitous technologies in the 2000s gave a new impetus to spatial learning, adapted to learning-for-reference scenarios
 kuch sahitya skool evam pramanik vyavastha donon ko ekikrut karne vaale mishrit adhigam paridrishyon kaa varnan karne ke liye ekikrut adhigam avadharana kaa upyog karte hai
 Three main theoretical schools or philosophical frameworks have been present in the educational technology literature
 ye hai vyavahaarwad, sangyaanavaad or rachnawad, teenon vaicharik skulon main se prayek aaj ke sahitya main upasthit he, lekin inkaa vikaas usee prakaar hua he jis prakaar manevigyaan sahitya kaa hua he
 Evolution of this theoretical structure Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, Edward C
 Tolman, Clark L
 Hull, B
C
 F
 Skinner and many others date back to the 20th century with animal learning experiments
 kai manovaigyanikon ne in siddhanton kaa maanav adhigam ke saath varnan or prayog karne ke liye istemaal kiya
 While it is still very useful, this learning philosophy has lost the support of many teachers
 bi
epa
 skinner ne apane maukhik vyavhaar ke prakaaryaatmak vishleshan ke aadhaar par shikshan main sudhaar par vyapak rup se likhaa tha or samakaleen shiksha main nihit mithkon ko samaapt karne ke prayaas main tathaa saath hi apni pranali jise ve kramadeshit anudesh kehete the, kaa protsaahan karne ke liye "da technology of teaching" likhi
 ogaden lindsle ne bhi isi prakaar vyavhaar vishleshan par aadhaarit seleration adhigam pranali viksit kii thi lekin vah keller or skinner ke model se bilkul alag thi
 Cognitive science has changed teachers' attitudes towards learning
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main sangyanatmak kranti kii shuruyaat ke bahut prarambh se adhigam siddhant main kaaphi parivartan aayaa he
 The empirical framework of behaviorism was mostly retained even though a new paradigm had been introduced
 sangyanatmak siddhant mastishk aadhaarit adhigam ko samajhane ke liye vyavhaar se pare dekhte hai
 Cognitionists consider how human memory works to promote learning
 sangyanatmak manovigyaan main atkinson-shifrine ke smriti model tathaa badele ke kaaryakari smriti model jaise smriti siddhant ke saidhantik dhaanche ke rup main sthapit ho jane ke baad, 1970, 1980, 1990 ke dashakon main adhigam kaa nayaa sangyanatmak dhaancha ubharne laga tha
 It is important to note that computer science and information technology have had a major impact on the theory of cognitive science
 computer science ke kshetra main anusandhan or praudyogiki dwaara kaaryakari smriti or deergh avadhi smriti kii sangyanatmak avadharanaon ko sugam bana diya gaya
 Another major influence on the field of cognitive science is that of Noam Chomsky
 aaj shodhakarta sangyanatmak bhaar tathaa soochna sansaadhan siddhant jaise vishyon par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 Constructivism is a learning principle or educational philosophy that many teachers started considering in the 1990s
 is darshan ke praathmik siddhanton main se ek he ki shikshaarthi nai jaankaree se apane swayan ke arthon kii rachana karte hai, jab ve vaastaviktaa yaa bhinn drushtikon vaale anya logon ke saath parsparik kriya karte hai
 a constructive learning environment requires that students use their prior knowledge and experiences to develop new, relevant and / or adaptive learning concepts
 Under this framework, the teacher's role becomes that of a guiding facilitator, so that the learners can construct their own knowledge
 Constructive teachers should make sure that prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught
 jonasen kaa suzav he "acchhee tarah se sanrachit" adhigam vaataavaran nausikhia shikshaarthiyon ke liye upyogi hota he or "biimaar sanrachit" vaataavaran keval adhik unnat shikshaarthiyon ke liye upyogi hote hai
 Teachers using technology, while teaching from a constructivist perspective, should choose technology that reinforces prior knowledge in problem solving environments
 sangyojanavaad "digital yug ke liye ek adhigam siddhant" he, jise jorge cemens tathaa steven downess dwaara apane vyavahaarwad, sangyaanavaad tathaa rachnawad ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par, yah samajhane ke liye ki ham kaise jite hai, ham kaise samvaad karte hai or ham kaise sikhte hai, is par praudyogiki kaa kya prabhaav hua tha, viksit kiya gaya tha
 Executive Editor of the International Journal of Teaching Technology and Distance Education, Donald G
 Perrin states that the theory "combines the relevant elements of multiple learning theories, social structure and technology to compose a powerful theoretical concept for learning in the digital age" 
 " Problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning are active learning educational technologies that are used to facilitate learning
 vah praudyogiki jisamen bhautik evam prakriya prayukt vigyaan shaamil hai, ko is pariyojna, samasya, poochtacha-aadhaarit adhigam ke saath sammilit kiya ja saktaa he kyonki in sab main ek samaan shaikshik darshan he
 All three are student-centered, ideally these include real-world scenarios in which students are actively involved in critical thinking activities
 vah prakriya ek praudyogiki maani jaati he, jise apnaane ke liye chaatr protsaahit hote hai
 Bloom's taxonomies and instructional design are excellent examples of technology used by teachers and educational technologies
 yah ek aisa kshetra he jahaan nae vichaarak har roj aage aa rahe hai
 Many ideas have been spread by theorists, researchers and experts through their blogs

 Some of the claimed benefits are listed below: haalanki kaksha main praudyogiki ke kai laabh he, vahaan spasht kamiyaan bhi hai
 Lack of proper training, limited access to a sufficient amount of technology and the need for additional time for multiple implementations of technology are some of the reasons why technology is often not used extensively in the classroom
 ek nayaa kaary yaa vyapaar seekhney ke samaan, kaksha praudyogiki kaa prabhavi ekikaran sunishchit karne ke liye vishesh prashikshan mahatvapurn he
 Since technology is not the ultimate goal of education, but a means by which it can be achieved, teachers should have a better grasp of the technology used and its benefits than more traditional methods
 yadi in donon main kshetron main se kisi ek main bhi kami he, to praudyogiki shikshan ke lakshyon ke liye ek laabh na ho kar baadha ke rup main dekhi jaaegi
 Another difficulty is introduced when access to a sufficient amount of a resource is limited
 yah aksar dekha gaya he ki computer kii maatra yaa kaksha ke upyog ke liye digital camaron kii sankhya ek puri kaksha kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hoti he
 In some less informed forms, there is also limited access to technology research due to high cost of technology and fear of degradation
 anya maamalon main, laptop ke madhyam se ek kaksha main hi computer pahunch kii suvidha hone ke bajaay ek kaksha ko parivahan dwaara computer prayogshaala main le jane jaisi sansaadhan sthaapan kii asuvidha ek baadha he
 Technology implementation may also take time
 kuch praudyogikiyon ke prayog main ek praarambhik seoup yaa prashikshan samay laagat nihit ho sakati he
 Even after the completion of these tasks, in the event of a failure of the technology during the activity, the teachers must have an alternative lesson ready as a result
 ek anya pramukh mudda praudyogiki ke vikasshil swabhaav kii vajah se uthta he
 Whenever the technology platform changes, new resources are to be designed and distributed
