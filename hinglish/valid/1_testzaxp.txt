 dhantola main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat purnia mandal ke arriya jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The power and sovereignty of the king, the state and the umbrella, and the punishment given to an offender for his crime is called punishment
 ek duusare sandarbh main, raajnneetishastra ke chaar upayon - sam, daam, dand or bhed main ek upaay
 The literal meaning of punishment is 'stick' by which one is beaten
 sanskaragat kshetra main mukhya rup se brahmacharee vidhyaarthee ke dwaara dhaaran kiye janevaale dand kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 Detailed descriptions of it are found in the Grihyasutras, Smriti, their commentaries, Vrhat Samhita and other texts of theology generally
 tadnusaar brahman, kshatriya or vaisya balak bhinn bhinn avasthaaon main jab acharya ke dwaara yajyavidhi se upanayan sanskaar se sanskrit hote hai to unhen saumyadarshan or anudvegkar dand bhi dhaaran karne hote hai
 The scriptural laws and traditional beliefs are that a Brahmin child should bear the punishment of Vilvandand, Kshatriya child, Lalapataryant Palashdand and Vaisyabalak Nasikaparyant Udumbar
 dand shabd kaa mukhya rup se prayog raajnneetishastra or prashasan ke sambandh main kiya jaataa he
 The punishment by which criminals are punished is the same, but it is used within the limits of state and government
 jab rajya kii seemaa ke baahar kisi, shatru, mitra, madhyasth athwa udasin rajya ke prati uskaa prayog kiya jaay to vah raajnneeti ke chaar upayon main ek ho jaataa he or usase taatpary hota he sainya prayog kaa
 The scripture that deals with the consideration of these things is penal and its policy is punishment
 dandniti sarkaar or prashasan kaa vigyaan he, jiskaa aadhaar he naitikta or vidhi kaa paalan, jo dand dhaaran karanevaale tathaa dand paanevaale donon hi par samaan rup se lagu hoti he
 Folk tour is not possible without him
 
 According to the definition of Kamandaka Nitisara and Mahabharata, suppression of crimes is called punishments or "policy"
 is kaary ko karanevaala arthath is gun kaa pratik raja 'dandi' kehalaata he, nayan ke kaaran
 Shankaracharya has quoted Manusmriti while commenting on Kamandaka, where it has been said that the enjoyment of the world is possible only due to the fear of total public punishment
 spasht he, bhartiya raajnneetishastra main dand kaa atyadhik mahatv tha jo vaastavik or pratikatmak, donon swaroopon se vyakt hota tha
 Many things have been said in Manusmriti about punishment
 manu kehete hai ki jo dand he vahi raja, vahi nyaay kaa prachaarkartta or sab kaa shashankartta, vahi chaar varna or ashramon ke dharm kaa pratibhu arthath jamin he
 The same king and the ruler of the subject, the protector of all the subjects, awakens among the sleeping people, that's why intelligent people call punishment as religion
 yadi raja dand ko achche prakaar vichaar se dhaaran kare to vah sab praja ko anandit kar detaa he or jo vina vichaare chalaaya jaay to sab ore se raja kaa vinaash kar detaa he
 All the characters of the punishment without punishment, ie the subjects are corrupted and all dignity becomes discolored
 dand ke yathavat na hone se sab logon kaa raja va rajya vyavastha ke viruddh prakope ho saktaa he
 It is also said that the punishment is very bright, which the unbeliever and godless cannot bear
 tab aisi sthiti main vah dand dharm se rahit raja va uske kutumb kaa hi naash kar detaa he
 It has also been said that a king who is devoid of education, obsessed and foolish in subjects, can never be able to punish with justice
 dand kii utpatti rajyasanstha kii utpatti ke saath hui
 In the Manusmriti and Mahabharata it has been said that the initial condition of mankind was of very pious nature, faultless deeds, virtue and seasons, when there was neither the position of a king, nor the kingdom, nor the punishment, nor the punishment and all the people
 They used to protect each other through religion
 kintu kalantar main tamasgunon kaa prabalya badhane laga, manushya samaaj apni aadim satv prakruti se chyut ho gaya or matsay nyaay chaa gaya
 The powerful started eating the weak
 aisi sthiti main rajya or raja kii utpatti hui or sabko sahi raaston par rakhane ke liye dand kaa vidhaan hua
 Punishment became a symbol of state power, which was the ruler, protector of all the subjects and awakened to sleep
 at: dand ko hi dharm sweekaar kiya gaya 
 It seems clear from this that the seeker of religion was considered as punishment only
 vah dharm jisamen arth or kaam bhi samahit he arthath dand trivarg kaa sadhak sweekrut hua
 Punishment was required to remove ejaculation from the norm
 rajya kii shakti ke rup main dand nyaayik kshetra main prasaarit hone laga
 Its purpose was to protect the beliefs and status quo of society and religion
 vah yathasthiti dharm ke naam se abhihit thi or dharm ke bhi varna, jati, ashram, desh, kaal, samooh, varg, parivaar or vyavsaay aadi bhedon par aadhaarit or bhinn bhinn roopon main maanya anek prakaar the, jinka gyaan dharmasanasth dandakartta ke liye atyaavashyak hota tha
 The king who used punishment also used to be punished if he violated religion
 dharm arthath vidhi se pare koi na tha dharm raajaaon kaa bhi raja tha
 The head of the state or any other power, such as the head of the republic, was the head of the judicial organization, but he could never be the head of the law, and the punishment would be on him for violating the law
 bharat main vidhi or dand kii yah samprabhutaa brahmankaal se lekar manusmriti or mahabharat ke yug ke bich viksit hui dikhaai detii he
 Modern jurisprudence believes four principles of punishment - sabhi deshon main samaaj kii atyant praarambhik avasthaa pratikaratmak dand kii thi, jisamen aankh ke badale aankh or daant ke badale daant kaa siddhant chalata tha
 Nouns like "biography" of Vedic literature indicate that the justice of the very early period of Indian history was harsh and symbolic
 is siddhanth kii manyata he ki ek apradhi ko kathor dand dene se duusare log aparaadh karne se darate hai
 The prohibitive principle holds that by punishing the offender, the person who has committed the crime gets his 'revenge'
 yah sabhi siddhanton main sabase bura siddhanth he kyonki isamen samaaj kaa kalyaan yaa samaaj kii suraksha kii bhaavana nahin he
 In the third stage the form of punishment became obstructive instead of symbolic
 iskaa kaaran tha doshi manushya ke prati dosha kiye gaye hue manushya kaa nipat lene ke bajaay dand dhaaran karanevaale rajya kaa bich main aa janaa
 Establishing the glory of state punishment by ending personal vendetta became a sign of the state's purpose and its growing power
 divaani ke maamalon main arthdand aadi dwaara dosha kiye gaye hue vyakti ko kuch badla dilaanaa yadhyapi vaid mana gaya, faujadaari ke maamalon main badla lenaa ab asambhav tha
 But harsh - at times it was often a rule to give extremely cruel and rude punishments
 yadi ham upanishdon ke daivadandon, baudhdhagranthon main varnit dandon, arthshaastra ke dwaara haath paanv kaat liye jane kii anushansaaon tathaa megesthnij dwaara kii janevaali uski sampushtiyon ko dekhen athwa purv or pashchim donon hi ore prachlit madhyakaalin or kuch had tak aadhunik kaal ke prarambh tak ke dandon kaa vivechan karen to yah kahana hoga ki ve atyant hi krur or aadhunik drushti se barbar the
 Their aim was to instill fear in others to commit crimes
 inamen ang-bhang, jivit jala diya janaa, mrityudand, aaajeevan karawas or asay yaatnaaon se bhare hue dand hote hai
 Preventive punishments include a measure to restrain the cause of the crime or his future doer, which is accomplished by taking away his personal freedom
 bharatvarsh kaa nirodhak jail vidhaan isi shrenee main he
 The fourth and best type of punishment is corrective
 sabhyataa ke vikaas ke kram main bhi yadhyapi sabhi deshon main sambhavit doshiyon ke prati dosha ke gambhir parinaam or dandyatnaaon kaa bhay upasthit karne ke liy kathor avarohak dand die jate rahe hai, par kabhi-kabhi sudharatmak pravritiyaan bhi uthati rahi hai
 In ancient Rome, the loss of the freedom of the guilty was considered the greatest punishment, and no torture was considered necessary thereafter
 bharatvarsh main kautilya ne karagraston ko praayshchitt karaane or apane paapon kaa bodh karaane kii vyavastha ke dwaara unhen vishuddh karaane kaa ullekh kiya he
 Ashoka, in his fourth column, has also ordered to reduce the punishments of the pure-witted, virtuous and good-natured convicts with behavior and punishments
 ye baaten dand vidhaan kii sudharatmak pravriti kii dyotak hai
 Memories include discussions of dhigdand or wagdand, which always preceded the judgments and slaughter
 uskaa taatpary yah tha ki saamaajik ninda maatr se yadi kaam chal jaay to kathor yaatnaaon kii aavashyaktaayen hi kya ? ek niyam to sarvamaanya tha or vah yah ki dand "yathaahe" ho or vah aaptdosh hone par hi diya janaa chahie
 In the 20th century, efforts are being made to give corrective form to the punishments
 1872 i main landan main ek antarrashtriya jail sudhaar or dandvidhaan ke kisi antarrashtriya swaroop ko nishchit karne ke liye sabha hui
 Later on, collective associations were also established, but its members remained mostly European countries
 dhire dhire kathor dandon ke sthaan par karagrast doshi ke naitik jivan kaa punarujjiwan lakshya mana jane laga
 There is hope more than fear
 dand ke sudharatmak siddhant main uskaa vidhaan doshi kii avasthaa, saamaajik vaataavaran or sthitivishesh ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Society and environment are also considered responsible for defects
 at: doshi ko sudhaarney ke liye manovaigyanik upayon kaa prayog, uskaa vaiyaktik str par vichaar, doshi baalkon ke liy sudharbhawanon kii vyavastha, audyogic shiksha, saadhaaran shiksha, naitik or dharmik vyaakhyaan or anya suniyojit vyavasthaayen kii jaati hai
 Like in some other countries in India too, efforts are on to make jobs and labor in dams, roads or other constructions that bind the prisoners, or to make social utility and family service through industrial education
 asambhav nahin ki kuch sadiyon main vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa apharan maatr sabase bada dand mana jaay or maanav swabhaav itnaa udaatt or pavitra ho jaye ki pranaharan or aaajeevan kathor karawas jaise dandon kii aavashyaktaa hi na rahe

 saadhaarant: prayek nurse ek varg kii visheshgy hoti he
 The major categories of work of nurses are: social and public health care, hospital care, industrial field care, nursing care and private medical care
 paricharya ke kitne hi upavibhag bhi hai, udaahranarth, aspataal main chikitsa-prakaar ke anusaar paricharya ke ye vibhaag ho jate hai-balak kii paricharya, hridrog paricharya, asthikarm paricharya, kshay paricharya, garbh vishyak paricharya, saamaanya aushadhopchaarik tathaa shalya chikitsaki paricharya, mastishk rogon kii paricharya, chhot ke rogon kii paricharya ityadi
 Nurses have to do a very important job in building a healthy nation
 rog kii anupasthiti ko hi swasthya nahin kehete, swasthya to nishchit rup se rahane kaa arthath us sthiti kaa naam he jisamen purna shaareerik, maansik tathaa saamaajik hrishthata ho
 After recuperating in the hospital, returning the patient to the same unhygienic environment as before, cannot be considered any progress towards building a healthy nation
 chaturdik swasthya kii bhaavana nurson ko logon tak pahunchaani padegi or unhen yah samajhnaa padegaa ki yadi swatchta rakhi jaae to du:kha kaa adhikansh bhaag apane aap dur ho jayega
 It is only nurses who can give people a good way to lead a healthy life
 unhen rogi or uske parivaar kaa un baton kii shiksha or buddhi deni chahie jisase ve nurse ke bidaa ho jane ke baad bhi apana ghar dwaar acha rakh saken
 The nurse nurse has to bear the entire responsibility of the new visitor, and therefore does not have to start his work when the child is born, but his work starts nine months before his birth
 janm se purv, janm ke samay, shishav, baalyavastha tathaa kishoravastha main, vah jaise bhi or jahaan bhi ho, ghar main, skool main, aspataal main, gali main, maidan main, sabhi jagah use balak kii sambhaal kerani padati he
 He has to help the parents and see that the child overcomes all difficulties
 use shikshak, paramarshdaata tathaa mitra kii haisiyat baratani hoti he
 Every nurse of child care needs special knowledge and more skills of child care so that she can take care of them scientifically
 bachche ke liye vah samay sabase adhik sankat kaa hota he jab use aspataal main laayaa jaataa he
 He leaves his mother and reaches a new world, where he does not know what is to be done to him
 uskaa kshubdh maansik santulan tathaa vikal manoveg use beemaari se kahin adhik santrast karte hai
 In such a situation, the importance of personal care in the hospital is more than the treatment
 balak paricharya kii nurse kaa hi yah mukhya kaary hota he ki vah bachche kaa vishwaas praapt kar le or use sab baaten pehle se hi saaf-saaf bataa de jisase vah chikitsak dwaara chikitsa tathaa honevaale kaaryon ke liye taiyaar ho jaae
 If something is done accidentally without telling the child in advance, he definitely opposes it
 hridrog paricharya kii nurse ke vishesh uttardaayitv hote hai or vaisaa hi uskaa prashikshan hota he
 Many diseases of the heart do not take necessary precautions in relation to their disease after the initial pain has subsided
 jo nurse rogi kaa ullekhneey vishwaas tathaa apane upar purna nirbharta praapt kar le, jo rogi kii shaareerik mudraon kaa abhipraay samajhe, jo apni rahan-sahan ko is prakaar dhaal sake ki rogi ko pareshaani na ho, vahi nurse hridapacharya ke liye yogya or safal siddh ho sakati he
 Nurses require a lot of skill to handle mental patients
 rogiyon ke bich nurse ko bahut saavdhaanee se apana kaam karnaa padataa he
 His behavior and his intimate care are definitely more useful than any medicine for the patient
 nurse ko rogi ke sambandh main prayek prakaar kaa gyaan hona chahie or un baton kaa to use avashya hi bhalee prakaar pataa hona chahie, jisase rogi kaa maansik santulan bighad jaataa he
 He has to deal with patients with patience, empathy and skill, as if they are his friends and loved ones, because the mental patients get out of the ordinary thing and all the little treatment and treatment they get
 Can destroy profits in an instant
 ye nurson kii vishesh dakshata ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 The nurse has some special duties in each particular area
 usko paricharya kaa laabh tabhi ho saktaa he jab use sthiti kaa sampurna gyaan ho
 But whatever the situation, the same and according to the instructions of the doctor, one has to work like a true servant of the patient

 Padmavati or Padmini was the queen of Ratna Singh, the king of Chittor
 is rajput rani ke naam kaa aitihaasik astitv bahut sandigdh he, or iskaa aitihaasik astitv to praayah itihaaskaaron dwaara kaalpanik sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 The main source of this name is the epic titled 'padmavat' by Malik Muhammad Jayasi
 anya jis kisi aitihaasik sroton yaa granthon main 'padmavati' yaa 'padmini' kaa varnan hua he ve sabhi 'padmavat' ke parvarti hai
 The name 'padmini' has been accepted mostly in the history texts, while Jayasi has explicitly accepted the name 'padmavati'
 jaaysi ke varnan se spasht hota he ki 'padmini' se unka bhi taatpary striyon kii ucchtam koti se hi he
 Jayasi has clearly written that King Gandharvasen had sixteen thousand Padmini queens, the best of which was Queen Champavati, who was Patarani
 isi champavati ke garbh se padmavati kaa janm hua tha
 Thus the name 'padmavati' is clearly accepted in the primary source of the story itself
 jaaysi ke anusaar padmavati sinhal dweep ke raja gandharvasen kii putree thi or chittod ke raja ratan sen yogi ke vesh main vahaan jaakar anek varshon ke praytn ke pashchaat uske saath vivaah kar ke use chittod le aayaa tha
 She was a unique beauty and Chittorgarh was invaded by the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji, upon hearing the description of her form by the poet-pundit-tantric Raghav Chetan, destined by Ratansen
 8 maah ke yuddh ke baad bhi allaudin khilji chittod par vijay praapt nahin kar sakaa to laut gaya or duusari baar akraman karke us ne chal se raja ratansen ko bandi banaaya or use lautaane kii shart ke rup main padmavati ko maanga
 Then deceit was also resorted to by Padmavati and with the help of gora-badal, King Ratansen was freed by being disguised with many heroes as Padmavati's associates in the palanquins
 parantu is chal kaa pataa chalate hi allaudin khilji ne prabal akraman kiya, jisamen dilli gayi praayah saare rajput yoddha maare gayi
 King Ratansen returned to Chittor but upon coming here he had to attack Kumbhalner and Devpal was killed in the war with Devpal, the ruler of Kumbhalner, but King Ratansen also returned to Chittor with great injuries and went to heaven
 udhar punah allaudin khilji kaa akraman hua
 Rani Padmavati along with sixteen hundred women was consumed by Jauhar and all the Rajput warriors were killed while opening the gate of the fort
 allaudin khilji ko raakh ke sivaa or kuch nahin mila
 Colonel Tod has repeated the same story in his history of Rajasthan with some manipulation in the above story of Jayasi
 mukhyatah bhaaton kii kathaon ke aadhaar par likhane ke kaaran karnal tod kaa varnan aitihaasik bahut kam rah gaya he
 He named Bhimsi instead of Raja Ratnasinh or Ratansen and he was also virtually Rana but not Rana Lakhmsi's uncle who was ruling the family as the child of Laxman Singh
 karnal tod ne lakshmana singh or uske sangrakshak ke rup main bhimsingh ke shashan kaa aarambh 1275 isvi main mana he; jabaki yah sarvagyaat baat he ki allaudin khilji kaa akraman 1303 isvi main hua tha
 Similarly, Col
 Tod has told Padmini the girl of Chauhan Vanshi Hamir Shankh of Sinhala Island
 in parivartanon ke sivaa shesh kahani apwaadon ko chhodkar praayah padmavat vaali hi he
 Rani Padmini is mentioned by Jain texts- Nabinandan Zenudhar, Chittai Charitra and Rayan Sehra between the 14th and 16th centuries
 tejpal singh dhama ne apane charchit shodhaparak upanyaas agni kii lapten main inhen jafana se prakashit granthon ke aadhaar par srilanka kii rajkumaari siddh kiya he
 His story is slightly different from Jayasi's Padmavat
 rani padmini, raja ratnasingh tathaa allaudin khilji ke akraman ko lekar itihaaskaaron ke bich kaaphi pehle se paryaapt manthan ho chukaa he
 In this context, the most quoted and certified Mahamaopadhyay Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha has been considered
 ojha ji ne padmavat kii katha ke sandarbh main spasht likhaa he ki "itihaas ke abhaav main logon ne padmavat ko aitihaasik pustak maan liya, parantu vastav main vah aajkal ke aitihaasik upanyaason kii si kavitabaddh katha he, jiskaa kalevar in aitihaasik baton par rachaa gaya he ki ratansen chittod kaa raja, padmini yaa padmavati uski raani or allaudin dilli kaa sultan tha, jisane ratansen se ladakar chittod kaa kila chhina tha
 Often everything else has been conceived to make the story interesting; Because Ratnasinha could not rule for a year, how can it be possible to become a yogi and go to Sinhaldwip and get married to the princess there
 uske samay sinhaladweep kaa raja gandharvasen nahin kintu raja kirtinishshank dev parakrambahu yaa bhuvnek bahu hona chahie
 There was no king named Gandharvasen in Sinhaldwip
 us samay tak kumbhalaner aabaad bhi nahin hua tha, to devpal vahaan kaa raja kaise mana jaay ? allaudin 8 baras tak chittod ke liye ladane ke baad niraash hokar dilli ko nahin lautaa kintu anumaan chah maheene lard kar usne chittod le liya tha, vah ek hi baar chittod par chadha tha, isliye duusari baar aane kii katha kalpit hi he
 " is prakaar yah spasht ho jaataa he ki jaaysi rachit padmavat mahakavy kii katha main aitihaasikta dhoondhna bahut had tak nirarthak hi he
 Some of the names are historical, but the events are mostly fictitious
 kuch ghatnaayen jo aitihaasik hai bhi unka sambandh 1303 isvi se na hokar 1531 isvi se he
 Similarly, the description of Colonel Todd is also largely historical
 is sandarbh main ojha ji kaa spasht kathan he ki "karnal tod ne yah katha visheshkar mewar ke bhaaton ke aadhaar par likhi he or bhaaton ne usko 'padmavat' se liya he
 Due to the absence of Ratnasinh behind Samar Singh in Bhat's books, Tad linked Padmini with Bhimsingh and considered it an incident of the time of Lakhmsi
 aise hi bhaaton ke kathananusaar taad ne lakhamasi kaa balak or mewar kaa raja hona bhi likh diya, parantu lakhamasi na to mewar kaa kabhi raja hua or na balak tha, kintu sisode kaa samant tha or us samay vriddhavastha ko pahunch chukaa tha, kyonki vah apane saat putron sahit apana namak adaa karne ke liye ratnasingh kii sena kaa mukhiya banakar allaudin ke saath kii ladaai main ladate hue maaraa gaya tha, jaisaa ki vikram samvath 1517 ke kumbhalgarh ke shilaalekh se upar batalaaya gaya he
 Similarly Bhimsi was not Lakhmsi's uncle, but grandfather, as found in the 'ekalingamahatmya' of Rana Kumbhakarna's time
 aisi dasha main taad kaa kathan bhi vishwaas ke yogya nahin ho saktaa
 If there is any root of the writings of 'padmavat', 'tithi Firishta' and the Rajasthan of Tad, it is only that Alauddin marched on Chittor and conquered it within six months' siege; King Ratnasinh was killed in this battle with many feudatories like Lakshman Singh, his queen Padmini along with many women died in the fire of Jauhar; Thus Chittor became a Muslim for a short time
 baaki bahudhaa sab baaten kalpana se khadi kii gai he
 " ojha ji ke bahu uddhrut uparyukt mat ko praayah sabhi itihaaskaaron ne sweekaar kiya he
 Dr
 Lal also wrote in his book 'history of the Khaljis, that after keeping the traditional narration of the story at bay, the naked truth is that Sultan Alauddin invaded Chittor in 1303 AD and after an eight-month long struggle he got it
 Authorized
 vir rajput yoddha aakrantaon se yuddh karte hue khet rahe or vir rajput striyaan johar kii jwaalaon main samadhisth ho gayin
 Amongst the women who became samadhi, there was possibly a queen of Ratnasinh, named Padmini
 in tathyon ke atirikt or sab kuch ek saahitiyik sanrachana he or uske liye aitihaasik samarthan nahin he
 Similar opinion is also of Dr
 SL Nagori and Jitesh Nagori
 yah chittod kaa pratham shaakaa mana gaya he
 It is said that Khilji hoisted his victory over the fort and killed 30,000 civilians there
 anek itihaaskaaron ne padmini ke naam tathaa astitv donon ko asweekaara he; parantu paryaapt vichaar ke baad dow0 aashirvadilal shrivastav tathaa dow0 gopinath sharma jaise anek itihaaskaaron ne kahani kii bahut si baton ko apramanik maanate hue bhi padmini ke astitv ko sweekrut kiya he, jaisaa ki ojha ji ke bhi uparyukt mat main vyakt hua he
 Dr
 Gopinath Sharma has written that "in our opinion, it is to be believed that the story tradition of Padmini begins with Padmavat of Jaisi, it is a complete illusion
 chhitaicharit main jo jaaysi se kai varshon purv likhaa gaya tha, padmini tathaa allaudin ke chittod akraman kaa varnan he
 In the blond-cloud quadrant of Haemartan; And this story has been written independently in the Padmini character of Labhodaya
 


 yah katha ek rajput pranali ke anuroop vishuddh tathaa swasth parampara ke rup main chali aayi he use sahaj main asweekaar karnaa thik nahin
 It is possible that many things have been practiced in different forms, from text to speech and from description style, but their basis cannot be found out from the truth
 sthapaty is baat kaa sakshi he ki chittod main padmini ke mahal hai or padmini taal he jo aaj bhi us vistrut tathaa vivadagrast mahila kii yaad dilaa rahe hai
 All the events given in relation to Padmini may not fit the test of truth, but the existence of Padmini, his understanding at the time of invasion, the leadership of Jauhar fast by him, etc
, have an independent significance
 " In fact, the main reason for the invasion and war of Alauddin Khilji was the imperial ambition of Alauddin and the military and commercial utility of Chittor
 gujarat, malwa, madhya pradesh, sanyukt praant, sindh aadi bhaagon ke vyapaarik maarg chittod se hokar guzarate the
 It is natural that a sultan like Alauddin Khilji would definitely want to gain authority over such an area
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki chittod akraman ke liye allaudin kaa pramukh aashay raajnneetik tha, parantu jab padmini kii sundarataa kaa haal use maaloom hua to usko lene kii uthkanthaa usamen adhik teevr ho gayi

 Nearly 5 lakh people were killed in the violence during partition and about 1
45 crore refugees left their homes and took refuge in the majority sect country

 They divided the citizens of India into different groups according to the sect
 unki kuch nitiyaan hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karti thim to kuch musalamaanon ke prati
 By the 20th century, Muslims began to fear the majority of Hindus and Hindus began to feel that the British government and Indian leaders were trying to give privileges to Muslims and discriminate against Hindus
 isliye bharat main jab azaadi kii bhaavana ubharne lagi to azaadi kii ladaai ko niyantrit karne main donon sampradaayon ke netaaon main hode rahane lagi
 In 1906, many Muslim leaders formed the Muslim League in Dhaka
 in netaaon kaa vichaar tha ki musalamaanon ko bahusankhyak hinduon se kam adhikaar uplabdh the tathaa bhartiya rashtriya congress hinduon kaa pratinidhitiv karti thi
 The Muslim League placed different demands at different times
 1930 main muslim lig ke sammelan main prasiddh urdu kavi mohammad iqbaal ne ek bhaashan main pehali baar musalamaanon ke liye ek alag rajya kii maang uthaai
 In 1935, the Legislative Assembly of Sindh Province raised the same demand
 iqbaal or moulana mohammad ali johar ne mohammad ali jinna ko is maang kaa samarthan karne ko kaha
 By this time Jinnah seemed to be in favor of hindu-muslim unity, but gradually he started accusing that Congress leaders were not paying attention to the interests of Muslims
 lahore main 1940 ke muslim lig sammelan main jinna ne saafe taur par kaha ki vah do alag-alag raashtra chaahate hai Hindu organizations such as the Hindu Mahasabha were strongly opposed to the partition of India, but believed that there were differences between Hindus and Muslims
 1937 main elahabaad main hindu mahasabha ke sammelan main ek bhaashan main vir saavarkar ne kaha tha - aaj ke din bharat ek raashtra nahin he, yahan par do raashtra hai-hindu or musalmaan
 Most of the Congress leaders were secular and against partition of India on the basis of sect
 mahatma gandhi kaa vishwaas tha ki hindu or musalmaan saath rah sakate hai or unhen saath rahanaa chaiye
 He strongly opposed partition: "my whole soul revolts against the idea that Hindus and Muslims are two opposing views and cultures
 aise siddhant kaa anumodan karnaa mere liye ishwar ko nakaarne ke samaan he
 "for many years, Gandhi and his followers tried not to leave the Congress to the Muslims, and in the process, leaders of Hindu and Muslim hot parties irritated them
 angrejon ne yojanabaddh rup se hindu or musalmaan donon sampradaayon ke prati shaq ko badhaava diya
 The Muslim League observed Siddhi Action Day in August 1946 and fierce riots broke out in Calcutta in which around 5000 people were killed and many injured
 aise maahaul main sabhi netaaon par dabaav padane laga ki ve vibhaajan ko sweekaar karen taaki desh puri tarah yuddh kii sthiti main na aa jaae

 Gandhiji pressured the Government of India to send the money to Pakistan early, while by this time the war between India and Pakistan had started and started a hunger strike to increase the pressure
 bharat sarkaar ko is dabaav ke aage jhukna padaa or pakistan ko dhan bhejnaa padaa

 Nathuram Godse cited this work of Mahatma Gandhi as a reason for his assassination
 bahut se vidwaanon kaa mat he ki british sarkaar ne vibhaajan kii prakriya ko thik se nahin sambhala
 Since the Declaration of Independence was announced earlier and the Partition was later announced, the responsibility of maintaining peace in the country came to the head of the new governments of India and Pakistan
 kisi ne yah nahin sochaa tha ki bahut se log idhar se udhar jaaenge
 People thought that security would be provided for the people of minority communities in both the countries
 lekin donon deshon kii nayi sarkaron ke paas hinsa or aparaadh se nibatane ke liye aavashyak intazaam nahin tha
 As a result, riots broke out and many people were killed and many people had to leave the house and flee
 andaaza lagaaya jaataa he ki is dauraan lagbhag 5 lakh se 30 lakh log maare gayi, kuch dangon main, to kuch yatra kii mushkilon se
 Critics are of the view that the short-sightedness of the early and immediate leadership of the British to transfer power early was responsible for the massacre and unrest that took place during independence
 vibhaajan ke baad ke maheenon main donon naye deshon ke bich vishaal jan sthanantaran hua
 Many Hindus and Sikhs were forced homeless in Pakistan

 After the demarcation of the boundary lines, about 1
45 crore people crossed the border for fear of violence and took refuge in the country of majority community

 praayah adhikansh vibhaajanon main jis tarah vibhinn dharmik samudaayon ke bich jitani hinsa hui, usase kahin adhik hinsa is vibhaajan main hui
 This division of India by the imperial Britain is one of the four divisions it made
 usne ireland, philistin or cyprus ke bhi vibhaajan karaae
 He explained the reason for these divisions is that people from different communities cannot coexist
 jabaki in vibhaajanon ke peeche keval dharmik or nasli kaaran nahin the, balki britain ke samrik or raajnneetik hit bhi shaamil the, jinke aadhaar par samjhauton ke samay usne apni ranneeti banaai or chaalen chalakar vibhaajan karaae

 Maihar is a small town in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh
 yah ek prasiddh hindu tirthasthal he
 The famous temple of Sharda Maa in Maihar is situated at a height of 600 feet amidst the garlands of the Trikuta mountain on the banks of the Tamsa in the lap of the naturally rich Kaimur and Vindhya mountain ranges
 yah aitihaasik mandir 108 shakti peethon main se ek he
 This Peeth is also famous as 'narasimha Peeth' after the name of Lord Narasimha, the main incarnation of Satyuga
 aitihaasik tathyon ke aadhaar par alhakhand ke nayak aalha va oodal donon bhai maa sharada ke anany upaask the
 Alha's pond and arena in the foothills of the mountain still exists
 yahan pratidin hajaaron darshanaathi aate hai kintu varsh main donon navaratri main yahaan mela lagata he jisamen lakhon yatri maihar aate hai
 The stone idol of Narasimhadeva installed next to Mother Sharda is about 1500 years ago
 devi sharada kaa yah prasiddh shaktipeeth sthal desh ke lakhon bhakton ke aasthaa kaa centre he mata kaa yah mandir dharmik tathaa aitihaasik he Brahma's son Daksha Prajapati was married to Prasuti, daughter of Swayambhuva Manu
 prasuti ne solah kanyaon ko janm diya jinamein se swaha naamak ek kanya kaa agni dev ke saath, swadha naamak ek kanya kaa pitrugan ke saath, sati naamak ek kanya kaa bhagwaan shankar ke saath or shesh teraa kanyaon kaa dharm ke saath vivaah hua
 The names of the wives of the religion were - Shraddha, Friendship, Mercy, Peace, Satisfaction, Confirmation, Action, Advancement, Wisdom, Medha, Titika, Hri and Murthy
 daksh ke prajapati banane ke baad brahma ne use ek kaam saunpa jiske antargat shiv or shakti kaa milaap karwaanaa tha
 At that time both Shiva and Shakti were different
 isiliye brahma ji ne daksh se kaha ki ve tap karke shakti mata ko prasann karen tathaa putree rup main praapt karen
 After penance, Mother Shakti said to Daksha, "I will be born as your daughter and become the Lord of Shambhu
 jab aap kii tapasya kaa punya ksheen ho jayega or aapke dwaara meraa anadar hoga tab main apni maaya se jagat ko vimohit karke apane dham chali jaaongi
 Thus Shakti in the form of Sati was born
 prajapati daksh kaa bhagavan shiv se manomalinya hone ke kaaran rup main teen mat hai
 According to one belief, Brahma initially had five heads
 brahma apane teen siron se vedapth karte tathaa do sir se veda ko gaaliyaan bhi dete jisase krodhit ho shiv ne unka ek sir kaat diya
 Brahma was the father of Daksha
 at: daksh krodhit ho gaya or shiv se badla lene kii baat karne laga
 But this view is fragmented by other authentic references
 shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main spasht varnit he ki janm ke samay hi brahma ke chaar hi sir the
 According to another opinion, despite Shakti himself being prophetically said to be the wife of Lord Shiva himself, Daksha did not consider Shiva to be in accordance with Sati
 isliye unhone sati ke vivaah-yogya hone par unke liye swayamvar kaa aayojan kiya tathaa usamen shiv ko nahin bulaayaa
 Still Sati put Varmala on the earth by saying 'shivaaya Namah' and after appearing there, Lord Shiva took the Varmala and went to Kailash, making Sati his wife
 is prakaar apni ichha ke viruddh apni putree sati dwaara shiv ko pati chunane ke kaaran daksh shiv ko pasand nahin karte the
 The third opinion is most prevalent
 iske anusaar prajapatiyon ke ek yajna main daksh ke padhaarney par sabhi devataaon ne uthakar unka sammaan kiya, parantu brahma ji ke saath shivaji bhi baithe hi rahe
 Daksha felt insulted by Shiva for not being respected by him as his son, that is, he was like a son, and he used his hatred towards Shiva and henceforth cursed him not to part with the gods in the yagya
 
 is prakaar in donon kaa manomalinya ho gaya
 After the said event, Prajapati Daksha conducted a huge yagna in his capital Kankhal, in which he did not invite his Jamata Shiva and daughter Sati to come to the yagna
 shankar ji ke samajhane ke baad bhi sati apane pita ke us yajna main bina bulaaye hi chali gayi
 In the sacrificial place, Daksha Prajapati insulted Sati and Shankar
 apmaan na sah paane ke kaaran sati ne tatkaal yajyasthal main hi yogagni se swayan ko bhasma kar diya
 On receiving the news of Sati's death, Lord Shankar produced Virabhadra and caused the sacrifice of that yajna by him
 virbhadra ne purv main bhagavan shiv kaa virodh tathaa uphaas karne vaale devataaon tathaa rishiyon ko yathayogy dand dete hue daksh prajapati kaa sir bhi kaat daalaa
 Later on Lord Brahma prayed by Lord Brahma, Lord Shankar got Daksha Prajapati in exchange for his head and provided the goat head with his yagya
 daksh-yajna-vidhwans kii katha ke vikaas ke spashtatah teen charan hai
 The first phase of this story is in the Shantiparva of Mahabharata
 katha ke is praathmik rup main bhi daksh kaa yajna kankhal main hua tha iskaa samarthan ho jaataa he
 There is no clear mention of yagna in Kankhal here, but in the country of Gangadwar, there is a mention of Yajna and Kankhal comes under Gangadwar
 is katha main daksh ke yajna kaa vidhwans to hota he parantu sati bhasma nahin hoti he
 In fact, Sati lives with her husband Lord Shankar on Kailash and is extremely distraught when her father Daksha does not participate in the invitation and yagya
 unki vyakulata ke kaaran shivaji apane mukh se virbhadra ko utpann karte hai or vah ganon ke saath jaakar yajna kaa vidhwans kar daalata he
 However, neither Virbhadra beheads nor consumes Daksha
 swaabhaavik he ki bakre kaa sir jodne kaa prashn hi nahin uthta he
 In fact, in this story, it is said to cut off the head of 'yajna' i

 completely destroy the 'yajna', which was added in later stories by cutting the head of 'daksha'
 is katha main daksh 1008 naamon ke dwaara shivaji kii stuti karata he or bhagavan shiv prasann hokar unhen vardaan dete hai
 The second phase of the development of this tale is described from the Shrimad Bhagavat Maha Purana to the Shiva Purana
 isamen sati hathpurvak yajna main sammilit hoti he tathaa kupit hokar yogagni se bhasma bhi ho jaati he
 It is natural that when Sati is consumed in Yogagni, from where will her corpse be saved! Therefore, there is no question of Shiva's wandering etc
 with his corpse
 aisa koi sanket katha ke is charan main nahin miltaa he
 In this story, Virbhadra originates from Shiva's jata and burns Daksha's head
 parinamswaroop use bakre kaa sir joda jaataa he
 The third phase of the development of the story is described in the subpuranas like Devipuran
 jisamen sati jal jaati he or daksh ke yajna kaa virbhadra dwaara vidhwans bhi hota he
 Here Virbhadra originates from the third eye of Shiva and the head of Daksha is also cut
 phir stuti karne par shiv ji prasann hote hai or daksh jivit bhi hota he tathaa virbhadra use bakre kaa sir jod detaa he
 However, here the Puranikars further increase the story and later Lord Shiva gets the body of Sati safely and resplendently found in the Yajnashala itself
 tab us laash ko lekar shivaji veikshipt kii tarah bhatakate hai or bhagavan vishnu kramshah khand-khand rup main chakra se laash ko katate jate hai
 In this way, 51 Shakti Peethas are formed by falling of different parts of the corpse at different places
 spasht he ki katha ke is tisare rup main aane tak main sadiyon yaa sahasrabdiyon kaa samay laga hoga
 In this way, the parts of Sati's body and the ornaments that were worn, wherever they fell, Shakti Peethas came into existence
 shaktipeethon kii sankhya vibhinn granthon main bhinn-bhinn bataayi gayi he
 The number of Shaktipeeths in Tantra Chudamani is stated to be 52
 devibhagwat main 108 shaktipeethon kaa ullekh he, to devigita main 72 shaktipeethon kaa zikr miltaa he
 51 Shaktipeeths are discussed in Devipuran
 paramparaagat rup se bhi devibhakton or sudhijanon main 51 shaktipeethon kii vishesh manyata he
 It is said that while Shiva was carrying the body of the dead mother goddess, her necklace fell on this place and hence the name Maihar
 There is also a story that Bhagwati Sati's upper lip fell here
