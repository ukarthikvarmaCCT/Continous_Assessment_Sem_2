 shukla ji ne praayah saahitiyik or manovaigyanik niabandh likhe hai
 3 parts of literary essays can be done - saiddhanthik aalochanatmak niabandh- 'kavita kya he'
 Essays such as 'sanskritism of Lok Mangal in poetry', 'generalization and individualism', etc
 come under theoretical criticism
 aalochana ke saath-saath anveshan or gaveshna karne kii pravriti bhi shukla ji main paryaapt maatra main he

 Psychological Essay- Psychological essays include essays written on emotions and psyche, such as compassion, reverence, devotion, shame, guilt, anger, greed, love
 shukla ji ke ye manovaigyanik niabandh sarvatha moulik hai
 Like him, no other writer has written so maturely on the above subjects

 He was a firm supporter of Lokadarsha

 The language of the prose-literature of Shukla ji is standing and it often has two forms - shukla ji kaa donon prakaar kii bhashaa par purna adhikaar tha
 He is extremely careful, refined, mature and grammatically innocent
 usamen ranchamaatr bhi shithilataa nahin
 The words are interwoven into the formula of sentences like pearls
 ek bhi shabd nirarthak nahin, prayek shabd kaa apana purna mahatv he
 Shukla ji's style is fully marked by her personality
 yahi kaaran he ki prayek vaakya pukaar kar kah detaa he ki vah unka he
 In general, Shukla ji's style is very mature and original
 usamen gaagar main sagar purna rup se vidyaman he
 There are mainly three forms of Shukla's style - inke atirikt shukla ji ke nibandhon main nigaman padhdati, alankaar yojana, tukdar shabd, hasya-vyangy, murtimatta aadi anya shailigat visheshtaayen bhi milti hai
 Shukla ji is perhaps the first critic of Hindi who made a genuine effort to interview the deep and broad goals of secret poetry in the fabric of diverse life
 unhone 'bhav yaa ras' ko kavy kii aatma mana he
 But in his view, the ultimate goal of poetry is not the joy but the reputation of Lokmangal by the sophistication, diffusion and harmony of various expressions
 unki drushti se mahan kavy vah he jisase jivan kii kriyasheeltaa ujagar hui ho
 He has called this the locality of folklore in poetry
 shukla ji kii samast moulik vichaarna lokajeevan ke moort aadarshon se patibaddh he
 'our heart is directly attached to the transverse forms of nature', therefore, the first and necessary work of the poet is to do 'bimbagrahan' or 'chitranubhav'
 purna wimbgrahan ke liye varnya vastu kii 'paristhiti' kaa chithran bhi apekshit hota he
 In this way Shukla ji emphasizes the overall realization of life through poetry
 jivan main or kavy main kisi tarah kii ekangita unhen abhisht nahin
 Shukla Ji's installations are not as scriptural as the original
 unhone apni lokbhaavna or manovaigyanik drushti se kavyashastra kaa sanskaar kiya
 With this view, they fall into Acharya category
 kavy main lokmagal kii bhaavana shukla ji kii samiksha kii shakti bhi he or seemaa bhi
 His power lies in poignant research into the practical and broader meanings of poetic life

 Shukla ji presented a high paradigm of practical criticism by the reviews of Jayasi, Sur and Tulsi
 inamen shukla ji kii kavyamrmagrata, jivanvivek, vidvatta or vishleshankshmata kaa asaadhaaran pramaan miltaa he
 They have the unique ability to identify poetic sensations, their transparent analysis and convey them to the reader through accurate language
 inke hindi sahitya ke itihaas kii samikshaon main bhi ye visheshtaayen spasht hai
 Shukla ji's psychotic essays are the result of Prajna
 inamen bhaavon kaa manovaigyanik rup spasht kiya gaya he tathaa maanav jivan main unki aavashyaktaa, mulya or mahatv kaa nirdhaaran hua he
 According to the sentiments, the behavior of man changes - in this view Shukla ji researched his social economy consciously
 unhone manovikaron ke nishedh kaa upadesh denevaalon par jabardast akraman kiya or manovegon ke parishkar par jor diya
 These essays help readers to understand themselves and others in practical terms and make them realize social responsibility and dignity
 samaaj kaa sanghathan or unnayan karanevaale aadarshon main aasthaa in rachanaaon kaa mul swar he
 By associating the emotions with the familiar situations of life, they are also authentic representations in terms of poetry
 apane sarvottam rup main shukla ji kaa vivechanaatmak gadhy paardarshee he
 He has an unusual ability to articulate deep thoughts in a coherent manner
 unke gadhy main aatmavishvaasajnya dridhtaa kii dipti he
 It has the distinct quality of preciseness and brevity
 shukla ji kii sukhtiyaan atyant arthgarbha hoti hai
 His critical prose has made a wide impact on Hindi prose
 shukla ji kaa 'hindi sahitya kaa itihaas' hindi kaa gauravagranth he
 The chronology based on literary trends, abstract representations of literary streams and a critical review of poets are its main features
 shukla ji kii kavitaaon main unke prakrutiprem or saavdhaan saamaajik bhaavon dwaara unka deshaanurag vyanjit he
 Their translations bear witness to their easy domination over the language
 acharya shukla bahumukhi pratibha ke sahityakar the
 He left an indelible mark on the field in which he worked
 aalochana or niabandh ke kshetra main unki pratishtha yugpravartak kii he

 In the late 18th century, a philosopher named D
 Trouille, describing the meteorite that fell at the location of Alberto in Italy, conceived the idea that it must have come in the form of a star bursting from the mantle, but no one paid attention to it
 san 1768 i
 main fadar basile ne france main luus naamak sthaan par ek ulkapind ko prithvi par aate hue swat: dekha
 The following year he read an article on this account in the session of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris
 academi ne vrittant par vishwaas na karte hue ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye ek ayog niyukt kiya jiske prativedan main fadar basile ke vrittant ko bhramaatmak bataate hue yah mantavya prakat kiya gaya ki bijli gir jane se pind kaa prishth kuch is prakaar kaanch sadrush ho gaya tha jisase basile ko yah bhram hua ki yah pind prithvi kaa ansh nahin hai
 Later, the German philosopher Claudney, studying a meteorite from Siberia in 1794, proposed the theory that the bodies are representative of the mantle
 yadhyapi is baar bhi yah vichaar turant sweekaar nahin kiya gaya, phir bhi cladni ko is prasang par dhyaan aakarshith karne kaa shrey mila or tab se vaigyanik is vishay par adhik manoyog dene lage
 In 1803, there was a huge rainstorm of meteorites at La Aigil location in France, in which countless small and big stones fell and often two or three thousand of them could be collected
 vigyaan kii francisi academi ne us vrishti kii puri chaanbin kii or ant main kisi ko bhi yah andeh nahin rahaa ki ulkapind vastut: khamandal se hi prithvi par aate hai
 The main classification of meteorites is based on their organization
 kuch pind adhikanshat: lohe, nikal yaa mishradhaatuon se bane hote hai or kuch silicket khanijon se bane pathar sadrush hote hai
 The first class is called metallic and the second class is called meteoric meteorite
 iske atirikt kuch pindon main dhatvik or aashmik padaarth praaia: samaan maatra main paae jate hai, unhen dhatvashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In fact, meteorites of all kinds of intercastes are found between completely metallic and completely wondrous invertebrates, which often makes it difficult to decide the class of bodies
 sanrachana ke aadhaar par teenon virgo main upbhed kiye jate hai
 There are two main strains in the heavenly bodies, one is called chondrite and the other is acoundrite
 pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa mukhya lakshan yah he ki unamem kuch vishisht vrittakar dane, jinhen kaundrul kehete hai, upasthit rahete hai
 Ponds in which the tendrils are not present are called achondrites
 dhatvik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upbhed hai jinhen kramash: ashtani or shashthanik kehete hai
 These names express the inner structure of the bodies and, as these names express, the bonds of metallic material in the first differential objects are configured in the octagonal shape and in the second in the crystalline shape
 is prakaar kii rachana ko vidamanstator kehete hai evam yah pindon ke marjeet prishth par badi sugamawa se pahachaani ja sakati he
 There are also two main subclasses in the metaphysical meteorites, which are called palacite and semi-metaphysical
 inamen se pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa aashmik ang mukhyat: aulivin khanij se bana hota he jiske sfat praaia: vrittakar hote hai or jo louh-nikal dhaatuon ke ek tantra main samaavrutt rahete hai
 Semi-metallic meteorites mainly contain pyroxene and small amounts of anorthite feldspars
 purv prakaran main yah ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki dhatvik or aashmik angon kii pradhanta ke aadhaar par ulkapind vargeekrut kiye jate hai
 But there does not seem to be any definite basis for the distribution of chemical elements and minerals in these bodies
 ulkapindon ke teen mukhya virgon ke atirikt anekanek upvarg hai jinamein se prayek kaa apana pruthak vishesh khanij samudaay he
 So far, 25 new classes have been detected and often one new subclass is being detected every two years
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki adhyayan ke liye uplabdh padaarth atyant alp maatra main hote hai
 So far the presence of only 52 chemical elements in meteorites has been certified, whose names are as follows: 
 Oxygen
 gandhak
 Platinum
 loha 
 argon gallium
 Phosphorus vung arsenic jarmenium barium vanadium Indium zirconium beryllium
 silicon 
 iridium
 Titanium
 manganeez sizium 
 antimony telurium meganecium sirium 
 aluminium
 Copper molybdenum sis 
 Carbon Thulium Yeshad
 sodium Cadmium
 nitrogen rajat scandium 
 calcium
 Out
 ruthenium swarna 
 coblt paarad rubidium straunsium 
 chromium
 Palladium
 radium
 Hydrogen 
 Chlorine
 potacium lithium
 Helium in 52 tatwon main se keval aath prachur maatra main paae jate hai, jinamein haalon sabase pramukh he
 The other seven are sequentially Oxygen, Silicon, Manganese, Sulfur, Aluminum, Nickel and Calcium
 inke atirikt 20 anya tatv paryaapt maatra main paae jate hai tathaa unki upasthiti kaa pataa saadhaaran rasinic vishleshan dwaara 1926 se purv hi lag chukaa tha
 The remaining 24 elements are present in very small quantities and their presence has been proved by spectral analysis
 khanij sanrachana kii drushti se ulkapindon or prithvi main pai gai shail raashiyon ke lakshanon main kai antar hote hai
 Generally, iron and nickel are very rare in independent metallic forms in global rock deposits, but in meteorites, metals are found in abundance in pure form, and often indispensably
 iske atirikt kai aise khanij hai jo bhumadleey shailon main nahin paae jate, par ulkapindon main milte hai
 Chief among these are Oldemite and Schreiberite
 ye donon khanij nami or oxigen kii bahulata main sthaayee nahin hote or isi kaaran bhumandaleey shailon main nahin milte
 Their presence suggests that the meteorites originated in an environment where the conditions of oxidation were lower than on the planet
 aashmik ulkapindon main saadharantaya piroxin or aulivin kii prachurtaa evam felsapaar kaa abhaav hota he, jisase unka sanghathan bhumandal kii atibhasmik shailon ke sadrush hota he
 The subject of the origin of meteorites is very controversial
 is vishay par anek mat samay samay par prastaavit hue hai, jinamein se kuch main inhen prithvi, chandramaa, surya or dhoomaketu aadi kaa ansh mana gaya he
 According to a very popular belief, they originated from a planet which is completely destroyed now
 is vichaar main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki aadi main praaia: mangal ke aakaar kaa ek grah rahaa hoga jo kisi duusare bade grah ke atyant sameep aa jane par, athwa kisi duusare grah se takaraakar, vinasht ho gaya, jisase arabon kii sankhya main chote bade khand bane jo ulka rup main khamandal main vichar rahe hai
 According to this view, the metallic meteors represent the central part of the fictitious planet and the astounding meteors represent the upper surface
 yadhyapi is upakalpana se ulkapindon ke anek lakshanon kii vyakhya ho jaati he, phir bhi anek baaten anbujhi paheli rah jaati hai
 For example, some metallic meteorites have an octahedral structure that is usually destroyed at 800 Â° C
 aisa vishwaas he ki us kalpit grah ke vikhandan ke samay avashya hi usamen adhik taap utpann hua hoga
 Still, it is not understood how this octagonal composition survived
 isi prakaar yah shankaa bhi bani rahati he ki akundrite aashmik ulka main loha kahan se aayaa or kaundrite aashmik ulka main kaunduul kaise bane
 In another opinion, it has been proposed that meteorites originated with the planets, or rather, that the solar system and all cosmic matter originated from meteorites
 is kalpana ke anusaar aadi vishwa ulkapindon se paripurna tha ev kalantar main ve pind vibhinn punjon main ekatrit hote gaye tathaa unke adhikadhik ghanikaran ke krmanusaar gasamay noharika, nakshatra evam grah utpann hue
 a major error of this imagination seems to be that meteorites present in the mantle are so dispersed and their mutual attraction is so weak that it will take too much time to collect and form a large amount
 kintu isamen koi andeh nahin ki ek baar paryaapt bade aakaar kii raashi ban jane ke baad vah apni satta banaae rakh sakegaa or kalantar main or adhik pindon ko apane main milakar apane aakaar kii vruddhi bhi kar sakegaa
 It is possible to partially modify the above methods to determine their actual method of origin
 ulkapindon kaa ek brihat sangrah kalkatte ke bhartiya sangrahalay ke bhuvaigyanik vibhaag main pradarshit he
 It is supervised by the Geological Survey of India

 khuli banaavat vaali mitti saghanta kii kami ke karan krishi ke liye acchhee hoti he, kyonki jal atirikt sthalon main pravisht kar khanij lavenon ko ghulaa saktaa he; par ejiniyari ke kaam ke liye yah mitti acchhee nahin hoti, kyonki jal pravesh ke kaaran mitti main saghanta honi chahie
 The denser the soil, the greater its strength and firmness
 saghanta kaa ghanatv vastut: ardrata kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 The percentage of humidity that provides maximum density for a particular type of soil is called the optimum humidity of that soil
 ishtatam ardrata halake roller kii tulana main baari roller ke liye kam hoti he
 The soil in which the compaction of low-size particles is good, has the highest density
 sanghanit mitti kii prabalata banaae rakhane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki pani ke mridukaran prabhaav kaa vah pratirohak ho
 For this, cement, lime, chemicals or bituminous substances are added to the soil
 yah pehle hi bataaya ja chukaa he ki mitti main pradhanthya ret, silt or mrittika rahete hai
 Along with these, it contains some solutes and some insoluble salts, such as carbonates of calcium and magnesium and chlorides and sulfates of sodium and potassium
 anek roopon main bhinn sandratha ke carbonic padaarth bhi rahete hai
 All these affect the chemical behavior of the soil
 jaisaa ki pehle bataaya ja chukaa he, ret or silt niskriy hai tathaa mrittika hi rasayanat: sakriy he, at: mittish ke rasinic gun mrittika par avlambit hai
 The clay is formed as a complex structure of many elements, such as iron, aluminum, silicon, etc
 mrittika ke khanij sanmishra ke kuch gun vilakshan hai
 It is insoluble in water, but may remain suspended in it
 iskaa nilambit rahanaa kanon ke aakaar par nirbhar he
 In the suspended state it gives acidic reaction
 isaki amlata aseetic amla kii amlata sadyash he
 This acidity can be neutralized by alkaline substances such as calcium and sodium hydroxide
 iske falswaroop calcium or sodium mittiyaan banati hai
 Due to the granular structure, calcicham soil is suitable for agriculture, but sodium soil is more useful for building dams and roads due to water logging
 mitti dwaara calcium ayan avashoshit hokar aisa sthirikrut ho jaataa he ki shuddh jal ke dwaara vah ghulkar nikal jaataa par anya lavan se saralata se pratisthapit ho jaataa he
 For example, when calcium soil is neutralized by a salt solution, sodium clay is formed from it and calcium ion comes into the solution in the form of chloride
 sodium mitti ko phir calcium, yaa anya mittiyon ke vilyan ke saath apkshalit karne se calcium, yaa anya dhaatuon kii mittiyon main parinat kiya ja saktaa he
 This property of soil, in which alkali is exchanged, is called the "exchange property of soil" and the cationic soils are interchangeable, of which calcium, sodium, potassium and manganium are the main ones and nickel, cobalt, boron etc
 are very few
 They live in moderation, although they are necessary for plant growth
 sookshm maatra main rahane vaale in tatwon ko anuposh "tatv' kehete hai
 The percentage of cation in a soil depends on exchange holdings, which are higher in montmorillonite grade soil and lower in kaolinite grade soil
 maantmarilonite koti kii mitti kaa udhaaharan kapaas vaali kaali mitti he, jo bharat ke madhyapradesh, madras or bombai ke kuch bhaagon main faili hui he
 Keolinite clay is commonly found in the alluvial plains of India
 jaisaa pehle sanket kiya ja chukaa he ki jis mitti main tanu amla ke upachaar se vinimeya kshar kaa nitant abhaav he, uski hydrogen aayan sandratha ucchtam hoti he or falat: pi ech nimnatam hota he
 As interchangeable ions such as sodium calcium are added to the soil, its ph increases
 mitti kaa ucchtam pi ech lagbhag 11 tak pahunch jaataa he
 In actual field conditions, some more ph has been observed, but the cause is not interchangeable cations, but rather soluble salts such as sodium carbonate, which are normally present in alkaline soils
 aise lavenon kaa ek nishchit seemaa se adhik hona fasalon kii vruddhi ko roktaa he
 But having sodium carbonate in soil is beneficial for engineering structure
 in lavenon kii upasthiti mitti kaa sodium mitti main parinat karti he, jo saadhan avasthaa main calcium mitti se adhik jal pratirodh karti he
 As a result, soil strength remains in moist condition, which is necessary for engineering structure
 nisarg bhoomi ke teen pramukh avyav hai, ret, silt or mitti
 Not only are there differences in the size of their particles, their chemical and physical properties are also different
 ret saadharantaya silica or sphatik kii bani hoti he
 Silica and crystalline are inert
 ret kaa aakaar 0
06 mimi0 se 2 mimi0 tak hota he
 Sand particles do not have cohesion and capillarity, but permeability is high
 silt ke ghatak silica or sphatik hi hai, kintu iske kanon kaa aakaar 0
0002 mimi0 se 0
06 mimi0 tak hota he
 Silt particles do not have fusion, but capillarity is considerable
 mitti ke kanon kaa aakaar 0
002 mimi0 se kam hota he
 Its dissimilarity with sand and silt is that clay particles react with chemicals due to chemical ingestion
 mitti kii adhikta se bhoomi main keshikatv tathaa sansanjan aata he
 Such a land swells when wet and shrinks when it dries
 mitti ke in spasht bhautik gunon kaa kaaran usamen kolyd kanon kii ucch pratishtata he, jisase hydrogen, sodium, calcium, potacium, magnesium aadi ke ayan prishth se adhishoshit hote hai
 These ions are interchangeable, meaning they are replaceable with other ions in the solution
 in ayanon ko adhishoshit karne kii ucchtam kshamta ko kshar kii vinimay dharita kehete hai
 The base of anions will be equally high
 mitti ke gun prishth par adhishoshit dhanayan par nirbhar karte hai
 The chemical components of different soils are the same, that is, in quantity, with,, and water, but different soils have different mineral compounds
 anek vaigyanikon ke eks kiran tathaa sajaateey shail vishleshan anek vaigyanikon ke eks kiran tathaa sajaateey shail vishleshan sambandhi prayogon ke falswaroop mitti khanij ke do samooh nishchit hue hen
 The basis of classification is the texture of the crystal lattice
 dekhen - chini mitti The minerals in this group are made up of sheets of silica and alumina
 is samooh ke khanij ke crystal jaalak do ikai silica chadar or ek ikai alumina chadar se bane hote hai
 Due to the variation of crystal lattice structure, there is a great difference in the chemical and physical properties of the soils of these two groups
 keolin khanij kii kshar vinium dharita nimna or uskaa adhishoshan gun bhi kam hota he, jab ki maantmarilonite khanij kaa dhanayan-adhishoshan hota he
 The predominant cotton black soil in the soil groups of India, which is often dominated by the whole of central and south India, belongs to the montmalonite group
 iskaa mukhya gun sikudna tathaa failana he, jo bhawan tathaa sadak nirmaan kii samasya he
 The discovery of this place has proved that the reaction of coarse lime reduces the lot of soil
 kavy main ek prakaar kaa shabd dosha Definition: According to Acharya Mammatt, the main element of poetry is defect, the teacher
 Acharya Vishwanath Prasad has described the defect in the literature as saying "rasapakarshaka Dosh:"
 It is not logical to do
 70 faults are mentioned in poetic light, they are usually divided into five faults: - 1-verse defect 2- Verse verse 3- Sentence defect
 4- Earth Dosh 5- Ras Dosh leonardo da vinci italivasi, mahaan chitrakaar, murtikar, vaastushilpi, sangitajna, kushal yantric, ejeeniyar tathaa vaigyanik tha
 Leonardo da Vinci was born in a village called Vinci in Florence, Italy
 is gram ke naam par inke kul kaa naam padaa
 These were illegitimate sons
 shaareerik sundarataa tathaa sphurti ke saath saath inamen swabhaav kii mohakta, vyavahaarakushalata tathaa bauddhik vishyon main praveenta ke gun the
 Leonardo began pursuing diverse subjects from an early age, but music, painting and sculpture were predominant among them
 inke pita ne inhen prasiddh chitrakaar, murtikar tathaa swarnakaar, aandrea del verocyo, ke paas kaam seekhney gayi or unki chhatrachhaya main rahakar kaary karte rahe or iske tatpashchaat milin ke rais ludovico sphotrsa kii seva main chale gaye, jahaan inke vividh kaaryon main sainik ejiniyari tathaa darbar ke bhavy samarohon ke sanghathan bhi sammilit the
 While living here, he completed two great works of art, an equestrian statue of Ludovico's father and a portrait titled "last Vyalu"
 ludovico ke patan ke pashchaat, san 1499 main, leanardo milin chhodkar florence waapas aa gaye, jahaan inhone anya kritiyon ke sivaay mona lisa sheershak chitra taiyaar kiya
 This picture and the picture called "last Vayalu" are considered his greatest creations
 san 1508 main phir milin waapas aakar, vahaan ke farasisi shaasha ke adheen ye chitrakaari, ejiniyari tathaa darbari samarohon kii sajaavat or aayojanon kii dekhbhaal kaa apana purana kaam karte rahe
 After his stay in Rome from 1513 to 1516, the French king, Francis I, took him to his country and arranged for him to stay in the coat of Ambaz
 yaheen inaki mrityu hui
 The difference between Leonardo and other European Renaissance artists is that Vinci did not spend time primarily copying artifacts of ancient times
 ve swabhaavat: prakruti ke anany adhyeta the
 In his paintings of life, along with the subtle reality of expressive representations, such a combination of live motion and flow of lines is found as is not found in any earlier painter
 ye pehle chitrakaar the, jinhone is baat kaa anubhav kiya ki sansar ke drishyon main prakaash or chaaya kaa vilaas hi sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee tathaa sundar hota he
 So they gave it proper importance along with color and lines
 asaadhaaran drishyon or roopon ne inhen sadaiv aakarshith kiya or inaki smriti main sthaan paaya
 They were engaged in the exploration of esoteric rules and causes
 prakaash, chaaya tathaa sandarsh, prakaashiki, netra-kriya-vigyaan, sharirarachana, peshiyon kii gati, vanaspatiyon kii sanrachana tathaa vruddhi, pani kii shakti tathaa vyavhaar, in sabake niyamon tathaa anya anek isi prakaar kii baton kii khoj main inkaa atrupt man laga rahata tha
 Very few of Leonardo da Vinci's authentic paintings have survived
 kai kritiyon kii pramanikta ke sambandh main andeh he, kintu upar varnit do chitron ke sivaay inke anya chaudaa chitra pramanik maane jate hai, jo europe ke pruthak pruthak deshon kii rashtriya sampatti samajhe jate hai
 It is not possible to estimate the value of his current paintings in money
 inaki banaai koi murti ab pai nahin jaati, kintu kaha jaataa he ki florence kii baptistary ke uttari dwaar par bani teen murtiyan, budapest ke sangrahalay main rakhi kaanse kii ghudsavaar murti tathaa pehle berlin ke sangrahalay main surakshit, mom se nirmit, flora kii aavaksh pratimaa leonardo ke nirdesan main nirmit hui thi
 There is a similar view in relation to some other idols, but certainly nothing can be said
 aisa jaan padataa he ki leonardo chitrakaari, vaastukala, sharirsanrachana, jyotish, prakaashiki, jal-gati-vigyaan tathaa yantriki par alag alag granth likhnaa chaahate the, par yah kaam puraa nahin hua
 Only incomplete articles or comments on these subjects are available
 leonardon ne itane adhik vaigyanik vishyon par vichaar kiya tha tathaa inamen se anek par inaki tippaniyan itani vistrut hai ki unka varnan yahan sambhav nahin he
 Apart from the above mentioned topics, he has given original and in-depth views on many scientific subjects like botany, zoology, physiology, physics, geology, natural geography, climatology, aeronautics etc
 ganit, yantriki tathaa sainik ejiniyari ke to ye vidvan the hi, aap daksh sangitajna bhi the

 sanchika sthanantaran protocol ek network protocol hota he jiske dwaara internet aadhaarit tisipi / ypi network par sanchikaon kaa aadan-pradaan kiya jaataa he
 This is used by user based code or anonymous user access
 ab lagbhag har santhaan main apatpi sarwar hone se, yah vyavastha kaam main nahin aati he
 Many recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers
 isse dur-daraaj se aane vaali sanchikaon par local filon jaisaa hi kaary ho saktaa he
 FTP URL is used in this
 sanchika bhejne ke anya tareeke jaise esaftipi or esasipi apatpi se nahin jude hote
 SSH is used throughout their process
 file transfar protocol yaa apatpi apane vartmaan rup main vibhinn charnon se hota hua pahunchaa he
 It was first formulated as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971 which was later replaced with RFC 765 in June 1980 which was converted from RFC 959 in October 1985
 uske baad anek suraksha sambandhi badlaav isamen aae
 These security changes were brought about because initially this method of sending files was very insecure
 is asuraksha kaa pramukh kaaran tha ki sanchika bhejne kii prakriya main koi bhi usee network par us file ko chura yaa nakal kar saktaa tha
 Prior to HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet, this was a common problem faced by Internet protocols
 is samasya kaa nivaaran esaftipi ke dwaara hi sambhav hua
 FTP can be operated in active mode, passive mode and extended passive mode
 refsi 2428 dwaara sitambar 1998 main, vistrut niskriy mod joda gaya tha
 When transferring data over the network, multiple data representations can be made
 do sarvaadhik saamaanya antaran mod hai: FTP server return codes indicate their status by their inner digits
 mul afatipi vinirdesan, sanchikaon ke antaran kii swaabhaavik asurakshit paddati he, kyonki ancrypted dhang se data antarit karne kii koi nirdisht vidhi nahin he
 This means that under most network configurations, usernames, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can use any packet detector located on the same network using a packet detector
 yah achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet jaise esasail ke nirmaan se pehle likhe gaye kai internet protocol vinirdeshon ke liye aam samasya rahi he
 The common solution for this problem is SFTP, or FTPS, which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP in the manner specified in RFC 4217
 afatipi seva pradaan karne vaala ek host, atirikt rup se anaam afatipi pahunch uplabdh karaane main sakasham hota he
 When asked for a username, users normally log in to an 'anonymous' account service
 yadhyapi aam taur par prayoktaaon ko password ke evaj main apana i-mail pataa bhejne ke liye kaha jaataa he, to aapurit jaankaree kaa satyaapan thodaa-bahut yaa bilkul nahin kiya jaataa he
 Since modern FTP clients typically hide the anonymous login process from the user, FTP clients can supply fake data as passwords because the application may not know the user's email address
 gofar protocol ko or saath hi saadhaaran fil antaran protocol or fil seva protocol ko bhi, anaam afatipi ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main sujhaayaa gaya he
 Where FTP access is not in use, remote or remote FTP or FTP mail is used
 isamen ek email duusare apatpi sarwar par bheja jaataa he jo apatpi cmand puri karata he or downlod sanchika vaali anulgnak waapas bhejtaa he
 This is especially used where FTP access is restricted
 doorvarti afatipi sarwar ko nishpadit kiye jane vaale afatipi cmand yukt i-mail bheja jaataa he
 It is a mail server that parses incoming e-mail, executes FTP commands and sends back e-mails with a file downloaded as an attachment
 yah spasht rup se ek afatipi client se kam lacheela he, kyonki nirdeshikaon ko parsparik kriya karte yaa adeshon ko sanshodhit karte hue nahin dekha ja saktaa he or uttar main bade sanchika anulagnkon ko mail sarwar ke madhyam se nikalne main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 These days most Internet users have easy access to FTP, so this process is not popular in day-to-day use
 vartmaan main aadhunik or haal hi ke web brouzar or file prabandhak, afatipi sarvaron se jud sakate hai, haalanki unamem apatpies jaise protocol vistaar ke liye samarthan kii kami ho sakati he
 This allows the interface, such as the interface used for local files, to be used to switch remote files over FTP
 yah ek afatipi yuarel ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It occurs as: vaikalpik rup se yuarel main password diya ja saktaa he, udaa
: Most web browsers require passive mode FTP, which not all FTP servers are capable of accomplishing
 kuch brouzar keval sanchikaon ko downlod karne kii anumati dete hai, par sarwar main sanchikaon ko aplod karne kaa koi saadhan uplabdh nahin karaate hai
 Representation of port numbers on IP addresses and port commands and PASV reply is another challenge for network address translation tools in dealing with FTP
 eneti upkaran dwaara in maanon ko badalanaa padataa he, taaki ve nat-ed client ke ai-pi pate or data conection ke liye NAT upkaran dwaara chune gaye port ko shaamil karen
 The new address and port may differ from their original address and port in the length of their decimal representation
 iskaa arth yah he ki NAT upkaran dwaara sabhi parvarti packeton ke liye tisipi anukram or pavati fildon ko badalte hue, niyantran conection par maan ko saavdhaanee se badla janaa chahie
 Such translations are not typically performed in most NAT devices, but special application-level gate-ways are available for this purpose
 SSH kii apeksha afatipi ek esaech conection kii apeksha saamaanya afatipi satr ketnal banane ke prayog ko sanderbhit karata he
 FTP uses more than one TCP connection, so tunneling over SSH is particularly difficult
 kai esaech clienton ke saath, niyantran channel ke liye tunnel taiyaar karne kaa prayaas keval channel kii raksha karegaa; jab data sthanantarit hota he, donon chor par afatipi software tisipi conekshnon ko sthapit karenge, jo esaech conection se baahar upmarg par guzarenge or is tarah gopneeyata, akhandta sangrakshan, aadi nahin rahegi
 Otherwise, SSH client software requires specific knowledge of the FTP protocol and monitoring and rewriting FTP control messages and autonomously opening new forwarding for FTP data channels
 esaech sanchaar suraksha ke software parikr kaa sanskaran 3 or jeepiel dwaara licensokrut echoensi, aise do software package hai, jo is vidha kaa samarthan karte hai
 FTP over SSH is sometimes referred to as secure FTP; It should not be considered another method of securing FTP like SSL / TLS
 SSH kaa upyog karte hue sanchikaon ko sthanantarit karne ke anya tareeqon main shaamil hai esafatipi or esasipi, jo afatipi se sambandhit nahin hai; inamen se prayek main, puraa vaartalap hameshaa SSH protocol dwaara surakshit he
 Patriarchy is a social system in which men have primary power
 rajnatik netritv, naitik adhikaar, saamaajik sammaan, sampatti kaa niyantran kii bhoomikaaon main prabal hote hai
 In the family's domain, fathers or other men have authority over women and children
 is vyavastha main stri tathaa purush ko samaaj dwaara die gaye kaaryo ke anusaar chalanaa padhta he
 Religion, society and conservative traditions make patriarchy more powerful
 sadiyon se mahilaayein pitrusatta ke kaaran utpeedit ho rahi hai
 There are different types of families, but patriarchy prevails in all types of families
 parivaar main vayaskon ke yonik sambandhon ko ek saamaajik rup se sweekaar kar liya jaataa he
 1
 Types of family: Single family and joint family
 Single family is a family consisting mostly of three or four people, parents and their children
 yah vivaahit jodon par kendrit hota he
 Nowadays single parent is also considered single family
 avadhi ekal parivaar yah shabd sab se pehali baar 20 veen sadi main dikhaai diya
 Joint families have been practiced for centuries
 kai vyakti apane jivan main do ekal pariwaron kaa hissaa hote hai, ek ekal parivaar jisame wo paidaa hote hai or doosraa wo jisame shaadi karke apana ghar basaate hai
 With proto-industrialization and the emergence of early capitalism, the single family became an economically viable social unit 1
2 Joint families are those in which communal use of resources, such as a married couple when their parents and sometimes brothers, sisters, live with
 bharat main sanyukt parivaar ek parampara he
 The joint family is still present in many wake of the country
 bade bade shaharon ko chhod ke saare gaanvon main or saare chote shaharon main sanyukt parivaar hi maujuud he
 Such families are headed by a patriarch
 wo purush sabhi nirnay karata he
 Family incomes are under his control
 kulapati kii dharmapatni paariwarik nirnay lene main sakasham hoti he
 Due to urbanization and economic development, joint families are decreasing in India
 kabhi kabhi ek hi kutumb main kai pidiyon ke log ek saath rahete paye jate hai
 In some societies, joint families are considered superior to single families because these families have a greater sense of solidarity, and at the same time better promote cultural norms and values
 sanyukt pariwaron main parivaar ke sambandhon ko vaivaahik sambandhon kii tulana main adhik mahatv diya jaataa hai
 a joint family usually consists of a patriarch
 is vyavastha ko pitrusatta kehete hai
 In such houses the male is predominant, he nurtures the family
 sanyukt pariwaron ke mukaable main ekal pariwaron main pittrusatta kii abhivyaktti jode kam paae jate hai

 Template: Block of Darbhanga District dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan sanyukt rajya america, britain or rus ne kandhe se kandha milakar dhuri rashtron- germany, italy or japan ke viruddh sangharsh kiya tha
 But as soon as the war ended, intense differences arose between Britain and the United States on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other
 bahut jald hi in matbhedon ne tanaav kii bhayankar sthiti utpann kar di
 The symptoms of the Cold War began to appear only during the Second World War
 donon mahashaktiyaan apane-apane sankeern swaarthon ko hi dhyaan main rakhkar yuddh lard rahi thi or paraspar sahyog kii bhaavana kaa dikhaava kar rahi thi
 The spirit of cooperation that was visible during the war was beginning to end after the war and the symptoms of the Cold War had clearly started to emerge, with both factions strengthening the feeling of complaining to each other
 in shikayaton ke kuch sudrudh aadhaar the
 Communist countries under the leadership of Russia and capitalist countries under the leadership of America were divided into two camps
 in donon pakshon main aapasi takaraahat aamane saamne kabhi nahin hui, par ye donon gut is prakaar kaa vaataavaran banaate rahe ki yuddh kaa khatra sadaa saamne dikhaai padataa rahata tha
 Berlin Crisis, Korea War, Molecular Testing by Soviet Russia, Military Organization, Indian China Problem, U-2 Plane Scandal, Cuban Missile Crisis were some of the circumstances which ignited the fire of Cold War
 san 1991 main soviet rus ke vighatan se uski shakti kam ho gayi or shityudh kii samaapti ho gayi
 Following are the main reasons for the origin of the Cold War
 yalta sammelan 1945 main roosevelt, churchill or stallin ke bich main hua tha, is sammelan main poland main pratinidhi shashan vyavastha ko manyata dene kii baat par sahmati hui thi
 But at the end of the war, Stalin turned his back on the promise and started supporting his Lublin government there
 usne vahaan par america tathaa britain ke paryvekshakon ko pravesh kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya or poland kii janavaadee netaaon ko giraftaar karnaa armbh kar diya
 He also began to expand his influence in Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, contrary to the terms of the agreement, he also hesitated to help Western nations against the Axis powers
 usne china ke samyavaadee dal ko bhi apratyaksh rup se sahaayta pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya
 He expressed his anti-compromise stance during the Manchuria crisis
 is tarah yalta samjhaute ke vipareet kaary karke soviet sangh ne aapasi avishvaas va vaimnasy kii bhaavana ko hi janm diya jo aage chalakar sheet yuddh kaa aadhaar bani
 At the time of war, ideological differences began to emerge between these two superpowers
 soviet sangh, samyawad ko badhaava dena chahta tha jabaki america poonjeevaad kaa prabal samarthak tha
 The policy adopted by the Soviet Union to promote socialist movements gave rise to a feeling of mistrust in America
 soviet sangh ne apni is niti ko nyaaypurna or aavashyak bataaya
 This gave a big blow to capitalism and many capitalist nations started condemning the socialist policies of the Soviet Union in favor of America
 is prakaar poonjeevaad banaam samaajawaadee vichaardhaara main talmail ke abhaav ke kaaran donon mahashaktiyon ke bich shityudh kaa janm hua
 During the First World War, the Soviet Union had started efforts to increase its national interests
 1917 kii samaajawaadee kranti kaa prabhaav duusare rashtron par bhi padane kii sambhaavna bad gai thi
 During the Second World War, its vigor displayed a sense of envy in the minds of Western nations, and Western powers began to fear that the Soviet Union would try to spread its communist program across the world on this strength
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke dauraan to ve chup rahe lekin yuddh ke baad unhone soviet sangh kii badhati shakti par chintaa jataai
 They started implementing anti-soviet policies
 unhone pashchimi rashtron ko soviet sangh ke viruddh ekajute karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 It was only natural to encourage the Cold War
 soviet sangh tathaa pashchimi shaktiyon ne dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan hi germany ke aatmasamarpan ke baad 6 maheene ke andar hi iran se apni senaayen vaapis bulaane kaa samjhauta kiya tha
 At the end of the war, Western nations promised to withdraw their forces from southern Iran as promised, but the Soviet Union did not
 usne iran par dabaav banaakar uske saath ek dirghakaalin tel samjhauta kar liya
 This created a feeling of malice in the minds of Western nations
 baad main sanyukt raashtra sangh ke dabaav par hi usne uttari iran se senaayen hataai
 This anti-compromise policy of the Soviet Union led to the Cold War
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad soviet sangh ne turki main apana dabaav bananaa armbh kar diya
 He pressurized Turkey to build a military base in some regions and in the phosphorus
 america tathaa anya pashchimi raashtra iske viruddh the
 During this time, the United States tried to give all possible assistance to Turkey by formulating the Truman doctrine so as to reduce communist influence there
 in paraspar virdohi kaarywahiyon ne sheet yuddh ko badhaava diya
 Under the 1944 agreement, Britain's authority over Greece was justified
 lekin duusare vishwayuddh ke baad britain ne apane aarthik vikaas ke drushtigat vahaan se apane sainik thikaane vaapis hataa liye
 The Soviet Union started helping the communists there when the civil war broke out in Greece
 pashchimi shaktiyon paramparaagat sarkaar kaa samarthan karne ke liye aage ai
 America exerted its full force in Greece under the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine
 isse samyavaadee kaarykram ko yunaan main gaharaa dhakka laga or soviet sangh kaa sapana chakanachur ho gaya atah is vaataavaran main shityudh ko badhaava milanaa swaabhaavik hi tha
 During the Second World War, when German forces under the leadership of Hitler were rapidly moving towards the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union sought assistance from Western nations to prevent the loss of their heavy life and property
 soviet sangh ne kaha ki pashchimi shaktiyon ko germany kaa veg kam karne ke liye soviet sangh main jaldi hi doosraa morcha kholaa chahie taaki roosi sena par germany kaa dabaav kam ho sake
 But the Western powers deliberately took too long to open a second front
 isse german senaaon ko rus main bhayanak tabaahi karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 This created a feeling of hatred against the Western powers of the Soviet Union, which later manifested itself as a Cold War
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan pashchimi shaktiyon ne dhuree shaktiyon ke akramanon ke viruddh mitra rashtron kii raksha karne kii bajaay tushtikaran kii niti apanaai
 They deliberately did not aid their Allies and forced their Allies to be defeated at the hands of the Axis Powers and to let their Allies be defeated at the hands of the Axis Powers
 isse yuddh purv kiye gaye sandhiyon va samjhauton ke prati anek man main avishvaas kii bhaavana paidaa hui jisase aage chalakar sheet yuddh ke rup main parinti hui
 The Soviet Union and Britain agreed to partition Eastern Europe in 1944 under the Balkan Agreement
 iske tahat bulgaria tathaa romania par soviet sangh kaa tathaa yunaan par britain kaa prabhaav sweekaar karne par sahmati hui thi
 In Hungary and Yugoslavia, both were said to have equal influence
 lekin dwitiya vishwayuddh kii samaapti par soviet sangh ne britain ke prabhaav kii apeksha karke apane samyavaadee prasar ko tej kar diya or un deshon main samyavaadee sarkaron kii sthapana kara di
 This led to what Western nations called non-conciliatory work
 isse soviet sangh tathaa pashchimi shaktiyon main dooriyaan badhane lagi or sheet yuddh kaa vaataavaran taiyaar ho gaya
 During World War II, the US secretly developed its nuclear program, and without the consent of the Soviet Union, it dropped atomic bombs on two cities in Japan
 america ne apni yuddh takanic kii jaankaree soviet sangh ko na dekar ek avishvaas kii bhaavana ko janm diya
 This deeply hurt the programs of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Western powers
 soviet sangh america ke parmaanu kaarykram par ekadhikaar ko sahan nahin kar saktaa tha
 This raised doubts in his mind that western nations hated him
 isi bhaavana ne shityudh ko janm diya
 After the Second World War, the two superpowers started campaigning against each other
 1946 main soviet rus ne âcanadian royal kamishanâ kii report main kaha ki canada kaa samyavaadee dal âsoviet sangh kii ek bhujaaâ he
 This strongly condemned the Soviet Union's communist propaganda in government and non-government sectors
 isse soviet sangh bhi satark ho gaya or usne america kii joardaar aalochana karnaa shuru kar diya, munro siddhanth iskaa spasht udhaaharan he jisamen samyavaadee takaton ko pashchimi golarddh main apana prabhaav badhaane ke prati sachet rahane ko kaha gaya
 Similarly, the Truman Doctrine and the US Senate openly criticized Soviet foreign policy
 iske baad soviet sangh ne america tathaa anya pashchimi rashtron ke viruddh samyavaadee takaton ko ikattha karne ke liye joardaar prachaar abhiyaan chalaaya
 This propaganda campaign gave rise to a sense of mutual suspicion which later came to the world in the form of Cold War
 dwitiya vishwa ke dauraan america tathaa soviet sangh main jo samjhauta hua tha uske tahat soviet sangh ko jo, aparyaapt sahaayta mil rahi thi, par bhi america ne kisi purv soochna ke bina hi band kar di
 It was only natural for the Soviet Union to be angry with this decision
 soviet sangh ne ise america kii sochi samajhi chaal maanakar uske viruddh apana ravaiya kadaa kar diya
 This gave rise to a feeling of mutual distrust between the two superpowers and this created an atmosphere of cold war
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad hi amarika tathaa anya pashchimi desh italy se apane sambandh badhaane ke prayaas karne lag gaye
 This made the Soviet Union suspect that these forces were responsible for promoting fascism and weakening communism in Italy
 isse soviet sangh ko anterrashtriya sambandhon main apni bhoomika simatati najar ai
 This thinking increased the distance between the two
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan hi soviet sangh kaa purvi berlin par tathaa america tathaa britain kaa pashchimi berlin par adhikaar ho gaya tha
 After the war, the western forces decided to introduce the new currency in the territory under their jurisdiction
 is faislen ke viruddh june 1948 main berlin kii nakebandi soviet sangh ne kar di
 As a result, the protocol between the Soviet Union and the United States or Britain was violated
 iske liye soviet sangh ko purna rup se doshi mana gaya
 The Soviet Union was not willing to admit its blame
 isse maamla suraksha parishad main pahunch gaya or donon mahashaktiyon ke madhya shityudh ke badal mandaraane lag gaye
 The United Nations was established after the end of World War II
 is sanstha main paanch deshon ko vito power praapt hui
 The Soviet Union repeatedly refused to accept every suggestion of Western nations by using its power, thus each resolution brought to the United Nations by the United States and Western nations suffered defeat
 isse america tathaa pashchimi raashtra soviet sangh kii aalochana karne lage or unase paraspar tanaav kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya jisane sheet yuddh ko janm diya
 After the end of World War II, the US and Soviet Union began to pursue their own interests
 ve lagaataar ek duusare ke hiton kii andekhi karte rahe
 This gave birth to power politics
 isse prayek raashtra ek duusare kaa shatru ban gaya
 Both superpowers became an arena of international conflict in an attempt to increase their dominance
 unke swaarthmayi hiton ne dhire dhire puure vishwa main tanaav kaa vaataavaran paidaa kar diya

 salaabat khan ne ek mudda ke rup main ise itnaa badha diya ki shahjahan ne salaabat se amar singh ko dand dene kaa aadesh diya
 Taking advantage of this, Salabat threatens Amar Singh and asks him to pay the penalty at the same time
 salaabat ne yah bhi chetavanee di ki vah amar singh ko bina dand kaa bhugtan kiye unhen jane nahin denge
 Amar Singh took out his sword and killed Salabat on the spot
 samraat shahjahan bhi is ghatana se achambhit ho gaye or amar singh ko maarane ke liye apane sainikon kaa aadesh diya
 However, the brave Amar showed his fighting prowess and killed all those who attacked him
 vah jaldi se kile se bhaag gaye or surakshit sthaan par laut gaye
 In the court the next day, the emperor announced that the man who killed Amar Singh would be made a jagirdar, although no one was ready to strike hostility with Amar Singh Rathore, as he had to face Amar Singh's wrath just a day before
 Was
 arjunasingh jo amar singh ke saale the, ne laalach main aakar is chunauti ko sweekaar kar liya
 Arjun Singh told Amarsingh that Shah Jahan realized his mistake and did not want to lose a warrior like Amar Singh
 haalanki amar singh ko shuruyaat main vishwaas nahin tha, parantu jald hi ve arjunasingh ke vishwasghaat kii kala ke jhaanse main aa gaye
 Meanwhile, a small door was erected in front of Shah Jahan's court, so that Amar Singh would have to bow before him to enter the court
 pehle amar ke krityon ko or adaalat main kaarywahi dekhakar, ek utsuk fakir ne samraat se poocha, "ham itane saare yoddhaon vaale hindustan ko kaise jeet sakate hai" shahjahan ne kaha, "ruko or dekhen ki ham kaise karenge "
 Amar was not ready to bow to the emperor and Arjun Singh realized this
 usne amar singh ko pehle pravesh karne kaha
 Amar obeyed his advice, Arjun Singh came from the other side and stabbed a dagger in Amar Singh's chest, Amar Singh got Virgati on him
 to arjunasingh ne unka sar kaata or samraat ke paas le gaya
 The king pointed to the fakir and said "now you know how we got rid of the warriors"
 baad main shahjahan ne arjunasingh ko bhi maar diya
 On notice of Amar Singh's death, Rajput soldiers led by his wife, Bhallu Singh and Ram Singh, attacked the fort where Amar Singh's body lay
 haalanki, hajaaron mughal sainikon ne rajput balon ko gher liya
 Bahadur Rajput forces resisted him until Amar Singh's body was taken away from the fort
 yadhyapi un sabhi rajput ladaakon ne apana jivan mrityu ko samarpit kar diya, lekin ve kabhi bhi mughal sultanate ke saamne jhuke nahin
 Later, the narrow gate in the fort became popularly known as Amar Singh Darwaza as it was a symbol of Rajput bravery over the Muslim army
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa daawa he ki shahjahan ne sthaayee rup se darwaja band karne kaa aadesh diya kyonki yah unhen rajput balon ke haathon se unki haar kii yaad dilaataa tha
 Folklore developed a heartfelt singing style in praise of those Rajput fighters who fought for pride and died with pride
 aaj agra ke kile main aane vaale paryatakon ke liye mukhya dwaar amar singh dwaar hi he
 Amar Singh Rathore is considered a symbol of extraordinary power, will and freedom
 na hi dar, na hi laalach apane faisle ko prabhavit karne main sakasham the
 He attained Amar Singh Rathore Virgati as a free man and the bravery of Balla Champawat is still remembered in folklore in Rajasthan and around Agra
 amar singh par aadhaarit ek hindi film 1 9 70 main 'vir amar singh rathod' naamak film banaai gai thi or radhakant dwaara nirdeshit thi
 Dev Kumar, Kumkum and Zabba Rahman were the lead actors of the film in Black and White
 ek gujarati film ko ek hi vishay par banaaya gaya tha or mukhya bhoomika gujarati super star upendra trivedi ne kii thi
 One of the gates of Agra Fort named him as 'amar Singh Gate' which is a major tourist attraction in Agra
