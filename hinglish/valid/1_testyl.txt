 The second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders

 The death of Yakshmakrantha Bhai, the interminable torture, had a miraculous effect on Tolstoy
 yuddh or shanti, aanna karenina or evan ilich kii mrityu main mrityu ke jo atyant maarmik chithran milte hai, unka aadhaar uparyukt ghatana hi rahi he
 After returning from the yatra, he opened a school in his village Yasnaya Polyana for the children of farmers

 In this, the present test system and the system of passing failed on its basis was not kept

 On behalf of the school, a magazine called "yasnaya Polyana" was also released in the name of the village, in which Tolstoy's articles published expresses very pithy views on various problems of the school and its students

 In the period from 1878 to 1885, Tolstoy remained inactive in terms of creating literary literature

 All of Ambakat's compositions began to seem futile to him

 The whole world had become enlightened by their ethos of faith and the recognition of Yasnaya Polyana Village had become famous as an excellent pilgrimage center

 It was during these days that he read Tolstoy's compositions and was attracted to them
 19veen shatabdi kaa ant hote hote daridron or asaaayon ke prati tollstoy kii sevavruti yahan tak badi ki unhone apni rachanaaon se rus desh main honevaali apnin samast aay daan kar di

 'punarutthan' naamak apane upanyaas kii samast aay unhone rus kii shantivaadee jati dukhebor logon ko rus kaa parityag kar canada main ja basane ke liye de di
 Suddenly in 1910, he decided to abandon his ancestral village "yasnaya Polyana" forever
 10 navambar 1910 ko apni putree eleclandra ke saath unhonen prasthaan kiya, par 22 navbanr 1910 ko maarg ke stesan astapovo main aksmaat fefde main dah hone se vahiin unka sharirant ho gaya
 His religion was very liberal and comprehensive
 tatkaaleen isai dharm ke prati unki spashtat: virdohi bhaavana thi
 From his thoughts he seems to be a kind of omnipotentist

 He considered man as the ultimate and inevitable culmination of the body

 They considered a purposeless, thoughtless and autistic life as a kind of sin; Even he considered sexual intercourse only for the purpose of procreation
 manovaigyanik rachanaaon main fyodor dostoyevski hi tolastay ke samakaksh thaharte hai
 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he

 There is a huge difference between the costumes and the language of every state

 That is the cultural unity and festivals here

 The festivals fulfill the enthusiasm, joy and enthusiasm in our life

 Aesthetics is the study of sensory-emotional qualities — religion and values
 kala, samskruti or prakruti kaa pratankan hi saundaryashastra he
 Aesthetics is a part of philosophy
 ise soundaryamimasaa tatha anandamimasaa bhi kehete hai
 Beauty is the scripture in which there is an elemental, philosophical and poignant interpretation of the beauty that is expressed or contained in artistic works, creations etc
 kisi sundar vastu ko dekhakar hamaare man main jo anandadaayini anubhuti hoti he uske swabhaav or swaroop kaa vivechan tathaa jivan kii anyaanya anubhutiyon ke saath uskaa samanvay sthapit karnaa inkaa mukhya uddeshy hota he
 Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy under which questions related to art, literature and beauty are discussed
 gyaan ke daayre se bhinn indriya-bodh dwaara praapt hone vaale taatparyon ke liye unani bhashaa main 'astetiko' shabd he jisase 'esthetics' kii vyutpatti hui
 a classical aesthetical approach related to nature, art, and literature developed
 yah nazariyaa keval kriti kii sundarata or kala-rup se hi apana sarokaar rakhte hue uske raajnneetik or sandarbhagat ayaamon ko vimarsh ke daayre se baahar rakhata he
 But there are also some methods of brainstorming art and literature that communicate the meaning of works and social and historical aspects of their creation process
 marxvaadi saundaryashastra ek aisa hi vimarsh he
 Plato's work in ancient Greek philosophy discusses the concept of beauty in Hippias Major
 naatak kii dukhaant style par arestu dwaara apni rachana poitics main kiye gayi vichaar ne kala-aalochana ko lambe arase tak prabhavit kiya he
 In the context of non-western ancient thinking on art and beauty, the Natyashastra of India, Abhinavagupta's rasa-siddhanta and the creation of Chinese scholar Cheng Yin-yuwan, Li-tai ming-hua Chi's unique and elaborate discussions presented in the Western world as well is believed
 kala-anushilan kii is parampara kii vyakhya karne ke gair-pashchimi maanak abhi tak nahin ban paye hai or pashchimi maanakon ke zariye kii gayi vyakhyaaon ke nattejey asantoshjanak nikle hai
 a separate concept of aesthetics emerged as a philosophical activity in Western thought in the eighteenth century when art works began to be isolated from handcrafts
 iskaa nateeja siddhantkaron dwaara lalit kala kii avadharana ke sutrikaran main niklaa
 Alexander Gottlieb Bomgarthen wrote an esthetica in 1750 to initiate a debate
 iske saat saal baad david hum dwaara ‘of da standard of test’ likh kar saundaryashastra ke ubharate hue vimarsh ko prashnaankit kiya gaya
 But the real beginning of modern European aesthetic aesthetics began with Emmanuel Kant's work published in 1790, Critique of Judgment
 apni is kriti main kaant ne saundaryashastreey akalan kii kasautiyon ko saarvbhaum banane par jor diya
 But on the other hand, he appeared to be skeptical of the possibility of any kind of universal aesthetics
 is virodhabhas ke baavjood kaant kii uplabdhi yah rahi ki unhone kala or saundarya kii vivechna ke liye kuch anivaary dvibhajanon ko sthapit kar diya
 The most notable of these dialects are: sense perception and logic, essence and form, expression and expression, pleasure and epiphany, freedom and necessity, etc
 kaant kii duusari uplabdhi yah thi ki unhone saundaryashastreey anubhav or andrik anubhav ke bich antar sthapit kiya
 He said that aesthetics should be interpreted and concluded without any practical attachment to the goal of analysis
 unnisvin sadi ke bare main kaha ja saktaa he ki vah saundaryashastra kii shatabdi thi
 It was only on Kant's land that German scholars later created a larger philosophical framework of aesthetics
 higel ne apni rachana lectures on esthetics main, shoppenhor ne da world ez vil and ripragentation main or nitshe ne berth of tragedy main pashchimi saundaryashastra ke vibhinn pahaluon kii baarik vyakhyaayein kin or uske naye ayaamon ko prakashit kiya
 Formalism emerged in English-speaking aesthetics in the late nineteenth century
 victoriayan britain ne ‘kala kala ke liye’ kaa naaraa diya jiske pravaktaaon main auskar wild kaa naam ullekhneey he
 The stylistic approach emphasizing purely aesthetic experience deeply influenced modern art forms in almost all fields
 lekin is andolan ke virodh kii dhvaniyaan mahaan roosi sahityakar liyo tolstoy kii rachana whot iz art? or america parinamwad ke pramukh pravaktaa jon divi kii kriti art ez experience main sunaayi deen
 Tolstoy argued that art that cannot communicate moral sensations among humans, however great it may be in terms of metaphorical criteria, cannot be appreciated
 divi ne bhi sampreshan kii bhoomika ke sawaal par rupvaad se loha lete hue kala ko saundaryashastra ke naam par uske daayre ke baahar maujuud anubhav kii sanrachanaon se kaat kar rakhane kaa virodh kiya
 The German tradition of aesthetic thinking continued into the twentieth century as well
 ghatnakriyashastra, vyakhyashastra or marxvad ke auzaaron kaa istemaal karke saundaryashastra sambandhi siddhanton ko or samrudh kiya gaya
 In 1936 Martin Heidegger wrote an essay like 'the Origin of the Work of Art' which is considered one of the best works of philosophy of art
 haidagar ne is niabandh main daawa kiya ki kala-kriti ko is jagat main sthit vastu ke rup main dekhnaa aadhuniktaa kii moolbhoot lakshanik trutiyon main se ek he
 According to Heidegger, art opens the doors of a new world, truth not only decreases in the form of art, it also inaugurates the existence of things in the realm of our own experience
 is tarah saundaryashastra ke madhyam se haidagar ne aadhuniktaa kii aalochana karte hue vastuon kii parmparik astitv-mimasaa or praudyogikeey vyakhya ko aade haathon liya
 By the mid-twentieth century, the utility of aesthetics began to be questioned
 sadi kii shuruyaat main diye gayi apane kuch vyakhyanon main edward bulo yah prashn puch chuke the ki kahin kala or saundarya kii paribhaashaayen kalakaar kii srijan- kshamta kaa kshay to nahin kar rahi hai
 These lectures were published in 1957 and in the sixties American artist Barnett Newman declared that the use of aesthetics is the same for art as that of ornithology for birds
 arthath saundaryashastra se anbhigya kalakaar hi acha he
 Under the study of culture, the oriented trends of aesthetics have been rigorously tested
 pier bordiyo ne samskruti ke samajashaastra ke tahat kala ke vichaardhaaratmak aadhaar kii na keval shinaakht kii balki yah bhi kaha ki isi kaaran se saundayshaastra apni hi saanskrithik or raajnneetik jadon kaa sandhan nahin kar paaya he
 Bordeaux's counterpoint to this idea is found in Adorno's work Aesthetic Theory
 adorno beesvin sadi kii avangaard kala kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki kala main abhi bhi vichaardhaara kaa pratwaad karne kii kshamta he
 According to Adorno, art is a product of its society, but its creation process also contains an autonomous moment from social determinism
 isliye vah kalakaar or uske darshak yaa pathak ko tatkaaleen prabhutvshaalee samskruti dwaara thamaye gayi taur- tareekon se itar sochane kaa mauka bhi detii he
 Some Marxist scholars have also tried to develop a Marxist category of aesthetics
 hindi ke pramukh marxvaadi saahityalochak namvar singh ne is tarah kii koshishon ko aalochanatmak drushti se dekhte hue iskaa pehla udhaaharan soviet sangh main ‘samaajawaadee yatharthwaad’ kaa shaastra-nirmaan mana he
 He has said, 'with the formation of scripture, social reality was also formulated and the style of expressing that reality too
 dekhte-dekhte ek nayaa ritivaad chal padaa, rachana main bhi, aalochana main bhi
 The country which had a socialist revolution, did not hesitate to make any revolution in the field of literature and art
 yatharth kaa aisa or itnaa apmaan to kranti ke pehle ke sahitya main bhi nahin hua tha or unnisvin sadi ke europe ke sahitya main bhi nahin jab burjwa kranti ne yatharthwaad ko janm diya tha
 The condition became very much like that of the literature-trend called Hindi rituals, when poems were being written keeping the characteristic texts of the rhetoric
 ’ Namvar Singh gives another example of a large treatise called Aesthetics by George Lukach
 ve ise lukach dwaara apane lagbhag saath varshon ke deergh sahitya-chintan ko antat ek vyavasthit shaastra main baandhane kaa viraat prayaas qaraar dete hai, ‘hazaron prishthon kaa yah vishaal granth abhi tak german bhashaa main hi uplabdh he or jo german acchhee tarah jaanate honge, vahi iske bare main kuch vishwaspurvak kah sakane main sakasham honge
 On the basis of what has been said about him so far in English and the impression he has received from his sporadic excerpts, it can be said that it has failed to try all the arts in 'imitation'
 is prakaar marxvaadi lukach jab sabhi kalaon ko ek shaastra main baandhane chalate hai to antat arestu kii sharan jane ko baadhya hote hai
 An English weekly reviewing this treatise had published a cartoon in which Aristotle's appearance and appearance with Lukach Marx's beard
 ’ namvar singh kii manyata he ki lukach ke drushtaant se marxvaadi saundaryashastra kii is lambi parampara kaa ek kamazor pahalu saamne aata he
 He says that 'often he himself failed to challenge an institution called' Kala 'and saw no harm in accepting the classical definition of art
 buniyadi rup main ek baar in paribhaashaon ko sweekaar kar lene ke baad to phir thode- bahut her-pher ke saath is-us kavi yaa kriti ke moolyankan kaa kaary hi shesh rahata he; or kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki marxvaadi saundaryashastriyon ne is kshetra main apni pratibha kaa johar bakhubi dikhaaya he— unchi samskruti ke bade-se- bade vichaarkon se hode lete hue
 The language of interpretation and evaluation is certainly materialistic as well as historical, but overall it is not very different from the dominant tradition

 lavan vah yogic he jo kisi amla ke ek, yaa adhik hydrogen parmaanu ko kisi ksharak ke ek, yaa adhik dhanayan se pratisthapit karne par banataa he
 Eating salt is a major salt
 rasayanat: yah namak sodium or chlorine kaa sodium chloride naamak yogic he
 Potassium nitrate is another salt formed by substituting the hydrogen ion of nitric acid with the potassium ion of potassium hydroxide
 nitric amla ke anu main keval ek hydrogen hota he, jo potacium se pratisthapit hota he
 The number of replaceable hydrogen in sulfuric acid is two
 at: sodium dwaara salphurik amla ke donon hydrogen ke pratisthapit hone par sodium sulphate naamak lavan praapt hota he
 Both compounds are called salts
 pehla normal lavan or doosraa amleey lavan kehalaata he
 Many salts are formed with the help of various acids and various bases
 lavenon kaa nirmaan nimnlikhit ritiyon se hota he : Zinc sulphate is obtained by the action of acids on metals, such as sulfuric acid on Yashid
 kshar, yaa ksharakon tathaa carboneton par amlon, yaa amleey ainhydridon kii kriya se, jaise potacium hydroxide par hydrochloric amla kii kriya se potacium chloride banataa he
 By direct combination of elements, such as direct contact with sodium and chlorine, sodium chloride is formed
 amleey oxidon or ksharak oxidon ke sangyojan se, jaise sulfur trioxide evam potacium oxide ke sangyojan se potacium sulphate banataa he
 By replacing one metal of a salt with another, such as copper sulphate in contact with iron, the copper replaces iron, forming ferrous sulfate
 kisi lavan evam kam vashpashil amla kii paraspar abhikriya dwaara, jaise sodium chloride par alp vashpashil salphurik amla kii kriya se sodium hydrogen sulphate banataa he
 Potassium chloride is formed by the action of alkali on salts, such as the action of potash on ammonium chloride
 do kshaaron kii paraspar kriya se, jaise sodium hydroxide par zinc hydroxide kii kriya se sodium zinket banataa he
 Potassium zincate is formed by the interaction of metal and base, such as the action of potassium hydroxide on zinc
 do lavenon ke bich ubhay apghaton se, jaise potacium chloride tathaa sodium nitrate se potacium nitrate evam sodium chloride banate hai
 Thus, the decomposition of two salts soluble in water, such as silver nitrate and potassium chloride, gives insoluble silver chloride in water and potassium nitrate soluble in water
 saamanytah jal main aviley lavan kii prapti main is reeti kaa vishesh rup se upyog hota he
 Barium sulfide is obtained by reduction of lead, or reduction of salts, such as reduction of lead sulfide, and reduction of lead sulfate and barium sulfate

 dhaatu, yaa dhatumulak pehle aate hai or amla peeche
 After removing the last part of the English name of acids, add "et", "item", "at" of it
 dwiangi yogic lavenon main "oid" or triangi lavenon main "ite" yaa "at" jodate hai
 The salts of sodium and hydrochloric acid are also called sodium hydrochloride, or sodium chloride
 triangi lavenon main lavan yadi amleey he, to usamen "ite" jodate hai, jaise sodium sulphite, sodium fasphite ityadi or yadi lavan narmal he, to usamen at jodate hai, jaise sodium sulphate, calcium phosphet ityadi
 In other words, the salt at the end of which is "as" is added to the salt item and the acid at the end of which is "ik", such as the salt of sulfuric acid is sulfide and the salt of sulfuric acid is sulfate
 lavenon kaa vargeekaran anek prakaar se kiya gaya he, jaise lavenon ke gun evam prakruti ke aadhaar par, lavenon ke sanghatan ke aadhaar par evam unke jaleey vilyan ke vyavhaar par
 According to one classification, salts are called "normal salts", "acidic salts", or "alkali salts"
 vargeekaran kii yah reeti is baat par nirbhar karti he ki amla ke sabhi hydrogen yanon kaa, athwa ksharak ke sabhi hydroxide yanon kaa, pratisthaapan hua he, athwa nahin
 In this classification, the salts obtained by substituting all the hydrogen and hydroxide ions of acids and bases are called normal salts
 hydrogen ke sabhi yanon kaa pratisthaapan na hone ke kaaran jo lavan praapt hote hai, unamem pratisthapaneey hydrogen ke aayan vidyaman hote hai or aise lavan ko amleey lavan kaha jaataa he
 Similarly, due to the special presence of replaceable hydroxides in the salts which are obtained due to the non-replacement of all ions of hydroxide, they are called alkaline salts
 udaahranarth, sodium chloride, sodium sulphate aadi narmal lavan hai
 Acidic salts like sodium hydrogen sulfate, sodium hydrogen phosphate etc
 and basic magnesium chloride, alkaline copper carbonate etc
 are alkaline salts
 lavan ke vargeekaran kii ek anya reeti main lavan kii visheshta evam ynikaran kii purnataa ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya jaataa he
 In this classification, the salts that give only one acid, or one basic, or one of them both, are called simple salts
 udhaaharan ke liye, sodium chloride, sodium hydrogen carbonate aadi saral lavan hai
 The combined salts of two similar salts in molecular ratio are called bicellular or binary salts according to this classification, such as the combined salts of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride are called bicellular salts
 vishesh prakaar ke dviki lavan tathaa do se adhik sadrush lavan ke sanyog se nirmit honevaale lavan ko fitkaree, yaa ailam kaha jaataa he
 Potassium sulfate, aluminum sulfate, and the salts formed by the addition of crystalline water, are called potash-alum, or potash alum
 kisi lavan main ek se adhik ksharak athwa amleey mulak kii upasthiti hone par aise lavan ko mishrit lavan kaha jaataa he, jaise sodium potacium sulphate
 Hybrid salts resemble normal bicellular salts, but their behavior in solutions differs from that of bicomponent salts, because their ionisation methods are different
 potacium pherosynide tathaa potacium dicromet sankar lavan he
 Normally, the solutions of normal salts are neutral, but solutions of many normal salts are also acidic or alkaline
 normal lavan ke vilyan kaa yah prabhaav jal ke saath lavan ke aayan kii kriya ke falswaroop utpann hota he
 This action is called water decomposition
 sodium synide lavan ko jal main gholne par vilyan main jal apghaton kii kriya hoti he, jiske falswaroop vilyan main sodium hydroxide tathaa hydrogen synide bane hai or chunki sodium hydroxide teevr kshar he, at: lavan kaa vilyan kshareey hota he
 The aqueous solution of ammonium chloride salts is acidic due to its water decomposition action
 aadhunik kaal main amla tathaa kshar ke saamaanya siddhant main vikaas hone ke falswaroop, lavan ke gyaan ke sambandh main bahut vistaar ho gaya he
 In this direction, the theory of scientist named Braunsted is considered very important
 is siddhant main kriya ke antim utpaada lavan kii apeksha amla tathaa kshar ke prakriyakram par adhik bal diya gaya he
 The chemical properties of salts depend on the cation and anion present in them

 vishwa ke sarvocch parvaton ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye san 1808 main britishon ne bharat kaa mahaan trikoshmetiya survey ko shuru kiya
 Starting in southern India, the survey team moved north, using a large 500 kg of theodolite to make the most accurate measurements possible
 ve himalay ke najadik pahaado ke paas pahunche san 1830 main, par nepal angrejon ko desh main ghusane dene ke prati anicchhuk tha kyonki nepal ko rajnatik or sambhavit akraman kaa dar tha
 Several requests were made by the surveyor, but Nepal rejected all the requests
 britishon ko tarai se avlokan jari rakhane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, nepal ke dakshin main ek kshetra he jo himalay ke samaanaantar main he
 The situation in the Terai was very difficult due to high rainfall and malaria: three survey officers died due to malaria while two were discharged due to poor health
 phir bhi, san 1847 main, british majaboor hue or avlokan stesan se lekar 240 kilometre dur tak se himalay ki shikharon ki vistaar se avlokan karne lage
 The weather stopped work at the end of the year for three months
 san 1847 ke navambar main, bharat ke british sarweyre jeneral andrayu vaug ne savaipur stesan jo himalay ke purvi chor par sthit he se kai saare avlokan taiyaar kiye
 At that time, Kanchenjunga was considered to be the highest peak in the world and he noted that there is a peak about 230 km behind it
 jon armastrang, jo vaug ke sah adhikari thea ne bhi ek jagah se dur pashchim main is chotii ko dekha jise unhone naam diya chotii ‘bi’
 Waugh later wrote that the observation indicates that the peak 'B' was higher than the Kanchenjunga, but the observation was from far away, it is necessary to observe closely for verification
 aane vaale saal main vaug ne ek survey adhikari ko tarai main chotii ‘bi’ ko nazdik se avlokan karne ke liye bheja par badalon ne saare prayaas ko roak diya
 In 1849, Waugh ceded the area to James Nicholson
 nicholson ne 190 kimi dur jirol se do avlokan taiyaar kiye
 Nicholson then brought a large conglomerate with him and headed east, with Nicholson from five different locations receiving more than 30 observations from 174 km to the nearest peak
 apane avlokanon par aadhaarit kuch hisaab-kitaab karne ke liye nicholson waapas patna, ganga nadi ke paas gaya
 Its rough calculation in Patna gave the average height of peak 'B' at 9,200 m मी, but it is not considered light refraction, which makes the elevation false
 sankhya saaf darshaya gaya, yadhyapi vah chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha
 Although Nicholson suffered from malaria and was forced to return home, the accounts could not be finished
 maikel henacy, vaug kaa ek sahaayak roman sankhya ke aadhaar par chotiyon ko nirdisht karnaa shuru kar diya, usne kanchanajangha ko IX naam diya or choti ‘bi’ ko XV naam diya
 In May 1852, the center of the survey was brought to Dehradun, an Indian mathematician Radhanath Sikdar and a surveyor from Bengal named the world's highest peak for the first time using a trigonometric calculation based on Nicholson's Everest after a former chief
 , Repeated accounts were done to verify and its official statement, that XV is the tallest, was delayed for many years

 In March 1856, through a letter, he completely announced his discovery to his representative in Calcutta
 kanchanajangha kii oonchaai saaf taur par 28,156 feet bataaya gaya, jabaki XV ki oonchaai bataai gai
 Vogue concluded about XV that "it is more probable that it is the tallest in the world"
 chotii XV kaa hisaab-kitaab lagaaya gaya ki yah puri tarah se 29,000 feet unchaa he, par ise saarvajanik rup main 29,002 feet bataaya gaya

 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it
