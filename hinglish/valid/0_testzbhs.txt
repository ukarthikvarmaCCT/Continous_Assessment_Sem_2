 Rosie huntington-whitley on the Internet Movie Database is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Gross domestic product ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 Gross domestic product or GDP or GDP is a basic measure of the economic performance of an economy, the market value of all final goods and services within a nation's range in a year
 GDP ko teen prakaar se paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jinamein se sabhi avadharanatmak rup se samaan hai
 First, it is equal to the total expenditure incurred for all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period
 doosraa, yah ek desh ke bheetar ek avadhi main sabhi udyogon ke dwaara utpaadan kii prayek avasthaa par kul vardhit mulya or utpaadon par sabsidi rahit kar ke yoga ke baraabar he
 Third, it is equal to the sum of the income generated by production in the country over a period — that is, the amount of workers' compensation, taxes on production and subsidized imports and gross operating surplus
 GDP ke maapan or maatr nirdhaaran kaa sabase aam tarika he kharch yaa vyay vidhi : "gross" means the depreciation of capital share has not been subtracted from GDP
 yadi shuddh nivesh ko uparyukt sameekaran main sakal nivesh ke sthaan par lagaaya jaae, to shuddh gharelu utpaada kaa sutara praapt hota he
 Consumption and investment in this equation are expenditure on final goods and services
 sameekaran kaa niryaat - aayaat vaala bhaag, gharelu rup se utpann nahin hone vaale vyay ke bhaag ko ghataakar or ise phir se gharelu kshetra main jod kar samyojit karata he
 Economists like to divide the term general consumption into two parts; Private consumption and public sector spending

 ek ghar ke dwaara nae awaas par vyay karnaa bhi nivesh main shaamil hai
 Contrary to its colloquial meaning, 'investment' in GDP does not mean the purchase of financial products
 vittiya utpaadon ke kray ko 'bachat' ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, nivesh ke rup main nahin
 The distinction is clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; But, if you buy a bond or a share of a stock, this transfer payment is set aside from GDP
 to stock or band paroksh rup se GDP ko prabhavit karte hai
 Although such purchases are commonly called investments, from a total economic point of view it is simply an exchange of contracts and not a part of actual production or GDP
 isamen koi hastantaran bhugtan jaise saamaajik suraksha yaa berogari ke laabh shaamil nahin hai
 Examples of C, I, g and NX: If you spend money to renovate your hotel, so that rates of occupancy increase, it is a private investment, but if you buy shares in a consortium to do the same It is a saving
 GDP ke maapan ke dauraan pehle vaala kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, baad vaale kaa nahin
 But, when the union makes its own spending on renewal, this expenditure will be included in GDP
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek hotel nijee ghar he, tab navinikaran vyay ko upbhog mana jayega, lekin yadi ek sarkari agency hotel ko naagarik sevaao ke ek karyaalay main badal rahi he, to navinikaran vyay ko saarvjaanik kshetra vyay kaa ek bhaag mana jayega
 If the renewal involves the purchase of a chandelier from abroad, the expenditure is also calculated as an increase in imports, so that the value of NX falls and total GDP is affected by purchasing
 yadi ek gharelu nirmaataa ko ek videshi hotel ke liye jhumar banane ke liye bhugtan kiya jaataa he, to sthiti vipareet hogi or bhugtan kii gananaa NX main kii jaaegi 
 phir se, GDP vyay ke madhyam se utpaadan kaa maapan karata he; yadi utpann jhumar ko domestic rup se karidaa gaya he, to ise GDP aankadon main shaamil kiya gaya hoga, jab ek upabhokta yaa vyaper ke dwaara ise karidaa gaya he, lekin kyonki iskaa niryaat kiya gaya tha to gharelu rup se utpann raashi ko dene ke liye gharelu rup se upbhog kii gai raashi ko "thik" karnaa jaruri he

 vaastavik GDP vruddhi kii gananaa karne se arthshaastriyon ko yah nirdhaarit karne main madad milti he ki mudra kii kray kshamta main parivartan se aprabhavit rahete hue, utpaadan kam hua he yaa badhaa he
 Another way to measure GDP is to measure the total income payable in GDP income accounts
 is sthiti main, kabhi kabhi sakal gharelu utpaada ke bajaay sakal gharelu aay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 By this, the same figures should be obtained which are obtained in the above expenditure method
 = GDP 
 vyavhaar main, haalanki, jab rashtriya sankhyikeey agenciyon ne report di to maapan truti kii vajah se donon aankadon kaa maapan halkaa sa alag paaya gaya
 Using the income approach, the formula for measured GDP is called GDP, which is: isamen aksar adhikansh chote vyavsaay shaamil hai
 The sum total of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income and it calculates the value of GDP at factor values
 buniyadi keemton or antim keemton ke bich kaa antar kul kar or sabsidiyaan hai jinhen sarkaar ne utpaadan par lagu kiya he yaa bhugtan kiya he
 So adding subsidy-free tax on imports and production converts GDP to GDP at factor cost
 ek anya sutara is prakaar se likhaa ja saktaa he: : Where r = rent i = interest p = profit SA = statistical adjustment w = wages GDP ko sakal rashtriya utpaada, ke vipareet mana ja saktaa he, jiskaa upyog sanyukt rajya america ne 1992 tak apane rashtriya khaaton main kiya
 The difference is that GNP consists of net foreign income rather than net exports and imports

 It is the market value of the total out put generated in a nation in a year
 GDP is baat par dhyaan detaa he ki out put kahan utpann ho rahaa he, is baat par nahin ki ise koun utpann kar rahaa he
 GDP measures all domestic products irrespective of their nationality of production units
 iske vipareet, GNP ek kshetra kii 'rashtriyata' ke dwaara utpann out put ke maan kaa maapan karata he
 GNP pays attention to who owns the production
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main, GNP america companiyon dwaara utpaadit out put ke maan kaa maapan karata he chaahe ye companiyaan kahin par bhi sthit hon

 adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhen rashtriya aay or utpaadan ke maapan Per capita GDP is not a measure of standard of living in an economy
 haalanki, aksar ise is prakaar ke sanketak ke rup main prayukt kiya jaataa he, is tark par ki sabhi naagarik apane desh ke bade hue aarthik utpaadan kaa laabh praapt karenge
 Similarly, GDP is not a measure of personal income per capita
 ek desh ke adhikansh nagarikon kii aay main kami aane par yaa an-anupaatik rup se parivartan hone par bhi GDP main vruddhi ho sakati he
 For example, in the US between 1990 and 2006, the income of individual workers in private industries and services increased by 0
5% per year, while GDP increased by 3
6% per year during the same period
 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main prati vyakti GDP kaa pramukh laabh he ki ise baar baar, lagaataar or vyapak rup se mapa jaataa he; baar baar kaa arth he ki adhikansh desh GDP par jaankaree tremasik aadhaar par uplabdh karaate hai, vyapak rup se arthath isamen GDP kaa kuch maap duniya ke har desh ke liye praayogic rup se uplabdh hota he or lagaataar arthath GDP ke bheetar prayukt takneekee paribhaashaayen, deshon ke bich tulanaatmak rup se sthir rahati hai or isliye yah vishwaas bana rahata he ki prayek desh main samaan maapan kiya ja rahaa he
 a major disadvantage of using GDP as an indicator of standard of living is that it is not strictly a measure of standard of living
 GDP ek desh main aarthik gatividhi ke kisi vishisht prakaar kaa maapan karata he
 According to the definition of GDP, it is not necessary to measure the standard of living
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek charam udhaaharan main, ek desh jisane apane 100 pratishat utpaadan kaa niryaat kiya or kuch bhi aayaat nahin kiya to bhi uskaa GDP ucch hoga, lekin jivan str bahut hi nimna hoga
 The use of GDP does not argue that it is a good indicator of standard of living, but is instead that living standards tend to rise in the event that GDP per capita rises
 yah GDP ko jivan str ke pratyaksh maap ke bajaay use iskaa pratinidhi banataa he
 Per capita GDP can be seen as a representative of labor productivity
 jaise jaise shramikon kii utpaadakta badhati he, karmchaariyon ko unke liye adhik mazdooree dekar pratispardhaa kerani chahie
 Conversely, if productivity is low, wages must be reduced or businesses will not be able to make a profit

 There is some doubt on this claim, however, the same principle led the economist Douglas North to win the Nobel Prize in 1993
 north ne tark diya ki nijee avishkaar or udhyam ko protsaahit karne ke dwaara, patent pranali kaa nirmaan or ise majbootee pradaan karnaa, england main audyogic kranti ke peeche mul utprerak ban gaya

 But if it is measured by the purchasing power of the egg, it has occurred many times
 is kaaran se, aam taur par kai deshon kii tulana karne vaale arthshaastri kai prakaar kii vastuon se yukt tokari kaa prayog karte hai
 This type of adjustment for an exchange rate is controversial because it is difficult to find comparable baskets of goods to compare purchasing capacity in countries
 udhaaharan ke liye, aisa ho saktaa he ki desh a main sthaneey rup se utane hi sebon kaa upbhog kiya ja rahaa he jitne ki desh b main

 Such a difference in content will not be evident in GDP figures

 The GDP framework cannot tell us whether the final goods and services generated during a specific period are a reflection of the actual termination expansion, or a reflection of capital consumption
 unhone jari rakhte hue kaha: For example, if a government is building a pyramid that has nothing for personal welfare, GDP will include it in economic growth
 In reality, however, building this pyramid will divert real wealth from wealth-producing activities, By which the production of property will be transferred

 But scholars have said that these sutras are not found in any appendix of the yet known Atharvaveda
 ho saktaa he ki swamiji ne ye sutara jis parishisht main dekhe hon vah durlabh ho tathaa keval swamiji ke hi sagyaan main ho
 In fact today, Swamiji's work called 'vedic Mathematics' has become a new Vedic appendix in itself
 swamiji ke ekmaatr uplabdh ganitiya granth ‘vaidic ganit' yaa 'vedon ke solah saral ganitiya sutara’ ke bikhare hue sandarbhon se chhantakar dow vasudev sharan agarwal ne sutron tathaa upasutron kii suchi granth ke aarambh main is prakaar di he— The literal meaning of this sutra is: 'one more than the former'
