 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, भारत's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 वर्ग मील of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 वर्ग मील of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, भारत's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, भारत focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, भारत established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 Depending on the electrical correlation of the body, generally the north pole magnet is used on the right parts of the body, forward and north, while the south pole magnet is used on the left, back and lower parts of the body
 is done

 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 is prayog vidhi main chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used

 Whether the pain is due to any reason, the magnet has the virtue of reducing it, rather than ending it

 For this reason, magnets have an effect on all diseases, pain goes away and disorders of body functions are cured
 chumbak kaa aakaar or dizin is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki use sharir ke kis bhaag par lagaana he
 There are some parts of the body, where large size magnets cannot be installed, small magnets will not work properly on some parts
 udhaaharan ke liye agar aankh par chumbak lagaana ho to chote aakaar kaa gol chumbak hona chahie, jo band aankh ke upar aa jaae
 On the other hand, if there is pain or swelling in most parts of the body, then a large size magnet will be applied

 According to the inscription of the Archaeological Department located outside the temple, the Shiva lingam of this temple is the tallest and largest Shivalinga in the temples of India

 is prakaar yah mandir aaj tak adhuraa he
 According to this belief, it is believed that the temple was built by the great patron of art, architecture and learning in the 11th century by Bhojdev, the Parmar dynasty king of central India
 paramparaon evam manyatanusaar unhone hi bhojpur evam ab tut chuke ek baandh kaa nirmaan bhi karavaaya tha
 The construction of the temple was never completed, so there is a lack of a foundation stone or a stone marking the opening / construction
 phir bhi yahaan kaa naam bhojpur hi he jo raja bhoj ke naam se hi judaa hua he
 According to some beliefs, this temple was to be built in one night, but its roofing work was done in the morning before completion, so the work remained incomplete
 raja bhoj dwaara nirmaan kii manyata ko sthal ke shilpon se bhi samarthan miltaa he, jinaki carbon aayu-gananaa inhen 11veen shatabdi kaa hi sunishchit karti he
 In a nearby Jain temple of Bhojpur, which has the identity marks of the same craftsmen, who are built on this Shiva temple; Only the date of construction of 1035 AD is inscribed on them
 kai saahitiyik kaaryon ke alaava, yahaan ke aitihaasik sakshya bhi varsh 1035 i main raja bhoj ke shashan kii pushti karte hai

 Only such a powerful king could build such a large lake and three big barriers
 ye sabhi sakshya is mandir ke raja bhoj dwaara nirmaan karawaaye jane ke paksh main dikhaai dete hai
 Archaeologist Prokirit Mankodi describes the construction period of this temple as late as the reign of King Bhoja, around the middle of 11th century
 udaipur prashasti main baad ke parmaar shaskaon dwaara likhvaaye gaye shilalekhon main aisa ullekh miltaa he jinamein: mandiron se bhar diya jaise vaakyansh hai, evam shiv se sambandhit tathyon ko samarpit he

 a Jain writer Merutung has written in his work Prabandha Chintamani that Raja Bhoj had built 104 temples in his capital Dhar alone
 haalanki aaj kii tithi main keval bhojpur mandir hi akelaa bachaa smarak he, jise raja bhoj ke naam ke saath joda ja saktaa he
 According to Prabandha Chintamani; When King Bhoj once visited Srimal, he told the poet Magha about the temple named Bhojaswamin which he was about to build
 iske uparant raja malwa ko laut gayi
 Though the Magh poet was not a contemporary of Raja Bhoj, the story seems to be anachronistic
 yah mandir multah ek 18
5 mile lambe evam 7
5 mile chaude sarovar ke tat par bana tha
 In the construction plan of this lake, King Bhoj built three dams of stone and sand
 inamen se pehla baandh betwa nadi par bana tha jo jal ko roke rakhata tha evam shesh teen ore se us ghati main pahadiyaan thim
 The second dam kept the drainage of water by connecting the location between the two hills near present-day Mandua village and the third dam was built in place of today's Bhopal city which diverts the water of a small seasonal river Kaliyasot to this Betwa lake
 Used to give ye kritrim jalashay 15veen shatabdi tak bane rahe the
 According to a Gond legend, Malwa Naresh Hoshang Shah broke this dam with his army, which took him three months
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki yahan hoshangshah kaa ladkaa band ke sarovar main main dub gaya tha tathaa bahut dhundne par bhi uski laash tak nahin mili
 Enraged, he blew the dam with a cannon and tried to knock the temple down with a cannon too
 iske kaaran mandir kaa upar or bagal kaa hissaa gir gaya
 Due to the breakdown of this dam, all the water was washed away and then due to the abrupt termination of this immense water, the climate change was brought in the Malwa region

 mandir ke nikat se dur tak pattharon va chattaanon kii kataai ke avshesh dikhaai dete hai
 The author Vidya Dehejia's book Early Stone Temples of Odisha mentions that there is a similarity in the construction of the Shiva temple in Bhojpur and the Lingaraja temple in Bhubaneswar and some more temples
 bhojpur mandir main bahut se anokhe ghatak dekhne ko milte hai jinamein se kuch is prakaar se hai: garbhagrih prabhag se mandap kaa vilopan, mandir main gumbadakaar shikhar ke bajaay sidhi rekhiy chat aadi
 Three of the outer walls of the temple are completely flat from the exterior, but they are said to be of the 12th century
 in anokhe ghatakon ke adhyayan karne ke uparaant ek shodhakartta krishna dev kaa mat he ki sambhawatah ye mandir antyeshti aadi kriyakarm sambandhi kaaryon se sambandhit rahaa hoga; jaisaa praayah shmashaan ghat aadi ke nikatavartti aaj bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 This research is also confirmed by some medieval architectural text discovered by Madhusudan Dhaki in due course
 in khandit paathyanshon se gyaat hua ki kai ucchkulin vyaktiyon kii mrityu uparaant unke avasheshon yaa antyeshti sthalon par ek smarak rupi mandir banavaa diya jaataa tha
 These types of temples were called swargaharana-prasada
 paath ke anusaar is prakaar ke mandiron main ekal shikhar ke sthaan par paraspar peeche kii ore ghatati hui pathar kii silliyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 According to Kirit Mankodi, the superstructure of the Bhojpur temple suits this format
 unke anumaan ke anusaar raja bhoj ne is mandir ko sambhawatah apane swargavaasi pita sindhuraj yaa taaoo vaakpati munj hetu banwaaya hoga, jinaki mrityu shatru kshetra main apmanjanak rup main hui thi
 Looking here, it appears that the construction work must have been stopped immediately
 haalanki iske kaaran abhi tak agyaat hi hai kintu itihaas vettaon kaa anumaan he ki aisa kisi prakritik aapadaa, sansadhano kii aapurti main kami athwa kisi yuddh ke armbh ho jane ke kaaran hi hua hoga
 The building did not even have a roof before its revival work began in 2006-07
 isse hi itihasvid kekemuhammad ne anumaan lagaaya ki chat sambhawatah nirmaan kaal main puure bhaar ke sahi akalan main ganitiya vaastu dosha ke kaaran nirmaan-kaal main hi dhah gayi hogi
 Then King Bhoj would have stopped the construction of the temple by not rebuilding it due to this defect
 tab kii parityakt sthal se mili saakshyon se aaj ke samay main itihasvidon, puratatvavidon evam vaastuvidon ko 11veen shatabdi kii mandir nirmaan style ke aayojan evam yantriki kaa bhi kaafii gyaan miltaa he
 Several quarry sites have also been found on the northern and eastern side of the temple, where incomplete crafts and crafts of various levels have also been found
 iske alaava mandir ke upree bhaag ke nirmaan hetu pathar ke baari shilp bhaagon ko khadaan se upar tak le jane ke liye bani bahut badi dhalaan bhi mili he
 Many sculptures have been found in such a way, brought from the mine near the temple
 inhen mandir nirmaan ke samay baad main prayog karnaa hoga, kintu nirmaan kaary ruk jane se inhen aise hi chhod diya gaya hoga
 The Archaeological Survey Department transferred them to its treasury house in the 20th century
 mandir nirmaan kii sthapaty yojana kaa vivaran khadaan bhaag ke nearesth pattharon par ukera gaya he
 It is known from this plan that there was a plan to build a large temple complex in which many other temples were also to be built
 is yojana ke safaltapurvak sampann ho jane par ye mandir parisar bharat ke sabase bade mandir parisaron main se ek hota
 The temple building, near the mines and other two temples of the village have been identified with more than 1300 artisans
 inamen mandir ke mukhya dhaanche par vibhinn bhaagon main mili 50 shilpakaaron ke naam bhi sammilit hai
 Apart from these names, there are other identification marks, such as chakras, severed chakras, wheels, tridents, swastikas, conch shells and Nagari script marks, etc
 ye chihn shilpakaaron yaa unke parivaar ke logon ke kaary raashi ke anumaan yaa akalan hetu banaaye jate the, jinhen imaarat ko antim rup dete samay mitaa diye jate the, kintu mandir nirmaan purna na ho paane ke kaaran aise hi rah gayi
 An incomplete statue at the site khadaanon main se ek par mila ek sthapaty khand Sculptures found near the entrance varsh 1950 tak is imaarat kii sanrachana kaafii kamjor ho chali thi
 This was due to continuous rainwater leakage, the resulting damping and the removal of internal protective coating

 unhone mandir ke uttar-pashchimi ore kii diwaar kii bhi punaruddhar abhiyaan ke antargat marammat kii
 After this, the work stopped for some time
 varsh 2006-07 ke dauraan kekemuhammad ke adhinsth vibhaag ke ek dal ne smarak ke punaruddhar kaary ko punah armbh kiya
 He also restored a ruptured pillar of the structure
 ye 12 ton bhaar kaa ekashm stambh vishesh shilpakaaron evam kaarigaron dwaara mul prati se ekadam miltaa hua banaaya janaa tha, atah iske liye mul sanrachana se mail khate pashaan kii desh paryant khoj ke uparaant shila ko agra ke nikat se laayaa gaya va is stambh kaa nirmaan sampann hua
 After this was made, the team could not get such a long arm crane machine, due to which the team completed the work with the help of a series of winches and levers
 is shrunkhlaa ko banane main unhen chah maah kaa samay laga
 KK Muhammed found that the weight of the two pillars of the temple was 33 tons, and both of them were monolithic, so it would have been a challenging task for the erstwhile artisans in the absence of modern technology and resources
 isi team ne mandir kii chat ke khule bhaag ko bhi ek naye mul sanrachana se mail khate hue vaastu ghatak se badla
 Because these components are made of fiber-glass, one is far less in weight than that part of the original structure, so does not put unnecessary load on the structure, the other is also able to effectively prevent rainwater leakage
 iske baad anya sroton se chat par jal risaav unmoolan hetu vibhaag ne deevaaron evam is nayi chat ke ghatak ke bich ke sthaan ko pathar kii silliyon ko tirachha rakhkar dhank diya he

 is mandir kii chat gumbadakaar hai jabaki itihaaskaaron ke anusaar mandir kaa nirmaan bharat main islam ke aagaman ke pehle hua tha
 Therefore, the unfinished domed roof on the sanctum sanctorum of the temple proves the practice of dome construction in India as pre-islam
 haalanki islamic gumbadon se yahaan ke gumbad kii nirmaan kii takanic bhinn thi
 Hence, some scholars consider it as the first domed roof building in India

 note In the Avesta also, the saga has the same meaning as the Vedic saga, that is, the lyrical mantra or motion
 ye sankhya main paanch hai jinke bheetar 17 mantra sammilit maane jate hai
 It is classified in terms of five verses and is famous by various names according to its initial letter
 gaatha avesta kaa pracheenatam ansh he jo rachana kii drushti se bhi atyant mahneey maani jaati he
 Within them, reformers and Zoroastrians of Zoroastrianism find their expression in human and historical form; His imaginary form here, which is abundantly available in other parts of the Avesta, is absolutely powerless
 yahan ve thos jameen par chalanevaale maanav hai jinamein jagat ke kaaryon ke prati aashaa niraashaa, harsh vishaad kii spasht chaaya pratibimbit hoti he
 His faith in a second God is absolutely firm, who keeps his unity and power firmly in the dynamic transformation of life
 gaatha kii bhashaa avesta ke anya bhaagon kii bhashaa se vaakyavinyas, style tathaa chand kii drushti se nitant bhinn he
 Scholars have divided the language of Avesta into two levels: gaatha avestan tathaa Modern Avestan
 inamen se pratham main pracheenatam bhashaa kaa parichay in gaathaon ke anushilan se hi miltaa he jo apane vaiyaakaran rupasampati main aarsh hai or is prakaar vaidic sanskrit se samanta rakhti hai
 Second language is a language developed in later times which can be said to be similar to the normal Sanskrit language
 gaatha kii style rochak he
 As a result, this style is completely different from the literary style due to the repetition and harmony of the previous parts of the Avesta
 chand bhi vaidic chhandon ke samaan hi pracheen hai
 The literary beauty of these gathas is not diminished due to the interesting configuration of the posts even if the subject is religious
 nape-tule shabdon main rachit hone ke kaaran ye gey prathit hoti hai
 Pishl and Geldner hold that there is no lack of logical work-cause-relationship in these gathas
 tathaapi ye footkal hai or zarathustra ke upadeshon kaa saar prastut karanevaale unke saakshaat vachan hai jinhen unhone apane shishy, bakhtri ke shaasha raja vishtashp se kaha tha
 Their sanctity and importance can be imagined automatically by the Prophet having his own words
 zarathustra ne in gaathaon main anek devataaon kii bhaavana kii badi ninda kii he tathaa sarvashaktiman ishwar ke, jise ve ahurmajd ke abhidhaan se pukaarte hai, aadesh par chalane ke liye parsi praja ko ajna di he
 He was a monotheist - so sure that he has completely denied the names other than Ahuramazd for that almighty
 gaatha kaa spasht kathan he : That is to say, we worship only those who are known by the works of their religion and by the name of Ahuramazd
 zarathustra ne spasht shabdon main ishwar ke upar apni drudh aasthaa is gaatha main prakat kii he : This clearly means that i have no other guard except God
 itnaa hi nahin, isi gaatha main aage chalakar ve kehete hai-mazadaao sakhaare mairi shto arthath keval mazda hi ekmaatr upasya hai
 Apart from these, no other deity is worthy of worship
 ahurmajd ke saath unke chah anya roopon kii bhi kalpana in gaathaon main kii gai he
 These are actually the qualities in the beginning, with the virtues of which Ahuramazd's imagination is special with the 'shaggunya Vigraha', Lord Vishnu
 avesta ke anya anshon main ve devtaa athwa farista bana die gaye hai or amesha spenta ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The introduction of his name and form is as follows: 1
 as = sansar kii niamak shakti 2
 Vohumano = love and purity 3
 spent armaiti = dharmik ekanishtha 4
 Kshtravaiyen = Indicative of dominance 5
 hauvartat = sampoornataa kaa suchak 6
 Amritatta = immortality, or immortality zarathustra ne in chhahon gunon se yukt ahurmajd kii aradhana karne kaa upadesh diya tathaa atash ko bhagwaan kaa bhautik rup maanakar uski raksha karne kii ajna irani janata ko di
 The other philosophical doctrine of Zarathustra in the saga Ahunvaiti is also propounded with gullibility
 vah he sat or asat ke paraspar sangharsh kaa tatv, jisamen sat-asat ko dabaakar aadhyatmik jagat main apni vijay udghoshit karata he
 Sat is the name of this mutually opposed couple of Assat - Ahuramazd and Ahriman - Ahriman is the symbol of untrue power and Ahuramazd is the representative of Sat Shakti
 praani maatr kaa kartavya he ki vah ahriman ke pralobhanon se apane ko bachaakar, ahurmajd ke aadesh kaa paalan karata hua apana abhinandaneey jivan bitaye kyonki paap kii haar or punya kii vijay avashyambhavi he
 Thus full of mystics, these stories have always been famous for their lofty idealism in Zoroastrianism due to thematic teachings
 in gaathaon main chitrit adarsh purna advaitvaad se pruthak nahin he
 Zarathustra's fascination in that direction is entertaining even before the Indian movement of monotheism
 malsi, garasain tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he

 at: jaise jaise vaayu upar uthati he, usamen jalawaashp dhaaran karne kii kshamta kam hoti jaati he
 Even by rising higher, the temperature of the air reaches the point where the air can hold water vapor
 isse bhi kam taap ho jane par, jalawaashp jalakanon main parivartit ho jaataa he
 From this clouds are formed
 phir badal jal ke kaaran dharaatal par baras padate hai
 Even after the formation of watercourse, if the temperature of the air is reduced by decreasing freezing point, the watercourse takes the form of snowflakes, which leads to snowfall
 varsha ke liye do baaten aavashyak hai : There are three types of rainfall: prakaar kii varsha adhiktar bumadhyarekhiy pradeshon main praaia: prati din hoti he
 Due to excess heat on the equator, abundant water vapor from the oceans is added to the air; Due to heat and vapor, the humid air rises lightly and other winds come to take its place
 vaayu upar jaakar thandi hoti he tathaa failati he
 Due to the high amount of vapor, the heat has to fall less to reach the dew point
 at: vaashp sheeghra jal kaa rup le letaa he or prati din praaia: do baje ke baad ghanghor varsha hoti he
 This rainfall is called Sustainable Rain
 vaashp se bhari hawaaon ke maarg main parvaton kaa avrodh aane par in hawaaon ko upar uthanaa padataa he jisase parvaton ke upar jame him ke prabhaav se tathaa hawa ke falkar thanda hone ke kaaran hawa kaa vaashp boondon ke rup main aakar dharaatal par baras padataa he
 These winds heat up as they descend into the ground on the other side of the mountain and also heat the surrounding environment
 vishwa ke adhiktar bhaagon main isi prakaar kii varsha hoti he
 Similar rainfall occurs in monsoon regions
 is varsha ko parvatakrut varsha kehete hai
 This type of rain comes due to mixing of hot and cold air, because light hot air rises and heavy cold air sits down
 at: upar uthanevaali vaayu thandi hokar varsha karne lagati he
 Thus, the rainfall is usually in the temperate zone
 kis sthaan par kitni varsha hui he, ise maapne ke liye ek yantra kaam main laayaa jaataa he, jise varshamapi kehete hai
 It is used to measure the amount of water pouring in a rain at a certain time and at a certain place
 varshamapi kai tarah kaa hota he
 Rainfall is mostly measured in inches or centimeters
 varshamapi ek khokhla belan hota he jiske andar ek bottle rakhi rahati he or uske upar ek keep laga rahata he
 The rainwater is filled into the bottle by the funnel and later the water is measured by a gauge
 is yantra ko khule sthaan main rakhte hai, taaki varsha ke pani ke keep main girane main kisi prakaar kii rukaawat na ho
 child marriage? a practice that no one is unfamiliar with
 balvivaah keval bharat main hi nahin apitu sampoorn vishwa main hote aaen hai or samooche vishwa main bharat kaa balvivaah main doosraa sthaan hai
 40% of the world's children are married in the whole of India and 49% of the girls in India are married before the age of 18
 bharat main, bal vivaah kerala rajya, jo sabase adhik sakshartaa vaala rajya he, main ab bhi prachlan main he
 According to the UNICEF report, more child marriages occur in urban areas in rural areas of India
 aankado ke anusaar, bihar main sabase adhik 68% bal vivaah kii ghatnaayen hoti he jabaki himachal pradesh main sabase kam 9% bal vivaah hote he
 It is strange to think that in India which is emerging as a superpower in itself, even today there is such a evil life
 ek aisi kuriti jisamen do aparipakv logo ko jo aapas main bilkul anjaan hai unhen jabaran zindagi bhar saath rahane ke ek bandhan main baandh diya jaataa hai or ve do aparipakv balak shaayad puri zindagi bhar is kuriti se unke upar hue atyaachaar se ubhar nahin pate hai or baad main stithiyaan bilkul kharaab ho jaati hai or nattejey talaak or mrityu tak pahuch jate hai
 So was this practice in India since time immemorial? Or was it later introduced? And if brought later, what was the reason for this? yah pratha bharat main shuru se nahin thi
 It came into existence during the time of Delhi Sultanate when the monarchical practice was in vogue
 bhartiya bal vivaah ko ladakiyon ko videshi shaskaon se balaatkaar or apharan se bachaane ke liye ek hathiyaar ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Another reason for starting child marriage was that older elders had more desire to see their grandchildren, so they married children at a young age so that they could spend some time with their grandchildren before dying
 balvivaah ke dusprinaam? Childbirth is the only result of which the most fatal infant and mother mortality rates increase
 Physical and mental development is not complete or ve apni jimmedaariyon kaa purna nirvehan nahin kar pate hai or inase ech

 Low economic status kya balvivaah ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya? Many people came forward in history to stop child marriage, the most prominent of which was Rajaram Mohan Roy, Keshab Chandra Sen who passed a bill by the British government called the Special Marriage Act, under which the age of girls for marriage is 18 and the age of girls is 14
 The year was fixed and it was banned
 phir bhi sudhaar na aane par baad main Child Marriage Restraint naamak bill paas kiya gaya isamen ladko kii umr badhaakar 21 varsh or ladakiyon kii umr badhaakar 18 varsh kar di gayi
 In independent India too, efforts were made by the government to stop it and some laws were made which improved them to some extent but it was not completely abolished
 sarkaar dwaara kuch kaanoon banaaye gaye hai jaise bal-vivaah nishedh adhinium 2006 jo astitv main hai
 The Act strictly prohibits child marriage instead of partially restricting it
 is kanoon ke antargat, bachche apni ichha se vayask hone ke do saal ke andar apane bal vivaah ko avaidh ghoshit kar sakate he
 But this law does not apply to Muslims, which is the biggest drawback of this law
 bal vivaah ko rokane hetu upaay? There may be some measures to prevent kindergarten like- 1

 Written By: Amit Sharma The Pindari or Pindari glacier flows near the Nanda Devi peak of the Kumaon Himalayas in Uttarakhand
 yah himand pighalane par pindari nadi ko janm detaa he jo alaknanda kii sahaayak nadi he
 The confluence of Pindari River and Alaknanda takes place in Garhwal district and is known as Karnaprayag
 baad main alaknanda or bhagirathi mil kar ganga kaa nirmaan karatin hai
 Pindari is famous for glacial trekking
 iske chaaro ore kaa trekking root lagbhag 90 kilometre kaa he or chah dinon main puraa kiya jaataa he
 Kamala river is a river originating from Nepal, mainly flowing in the state of Bihar, India
 yah nadi mithilanchal main ganga nadi ke baad sarvaadhik punyadayini tathaa mahatvapurn urvara-shakti yukt maani jaati he
 Kamala's place of origin is in a series called 'mahabharata mountain' of Nepal
 kamala tristrotsa nadi he; arthath multah teen dharaayen milakar kamala nadi banati he
 Sources from the west and central part of the state come from Sindhuli district of Nepal to Dhanukha district
 inamen pashchim ke strot se madhya kaa strot chota he, lekin purv kaa teesraa strot lanbaa he or kamala kaa vaastavik udgam yahi strot he
 The source originates in the northern end of Udaipur district of Sagarmatha zone and it flows from Udaipur Garhi to the Nairitya angle in the Dhanukha district of Janakpur zone and the three sources converge and move south
 pehle pashchim or madhya bhaag ke sroton kaa milan hota he or phir teenon dharaayen paraspar milakar lagbhag 18 mile purv disha kii ore bahane ke baad udaipur gadhi ke uttar se nepal ke pahari bhaag main lagbhag 15 mile bahati hai or tab uski tarai ke dhanukha jile main utarati he
 After flowing about 20 miles south of this Terai section too, Kamala originates in the present Madhubani district of Bihar near the famous place called Jayanagar in the state of Bihar, India, where it is recognized as a highly sacred river
 punya kii drushti se mithila main ganga ke baad kamala kaa hi sarvopari sthaan he
 In the Chaturdash chapter of Srivriddhvishnupurana, in the order of enumerating the important rivers of Mithila under 'mithila-mahatmya', 'kamala' is named after 'koshi' for the first time
 yadhyapi mithilanchal kii nadiyon main kosi sabase badi nadi he, parantu uski prasiddhi mahavinashni nadi ke rup main hi rahi he
 In contrast, Kamala has been famous as Shashyhasta Vishnupriya Lakshmi
 log ise 'kamala maiyaa' kah kar puujate hai
 a belief has also been to consider Kosi as Mahakali, Kamala as Mahalakshmi and Bagmati as Mahasaraswati
 kosi kaa pani jidhar se bahata he udhar kii jameen banjar ho jaati he; jabaki kamala kaa pani baadh main jidhar se gujarata he udhar aisi paank chhodte jaataa he ki fasalon kii upaj kai guna bad jaati he
 Therefore, despite taking a formidable form in the flood and causing considerable damage, Kamala's glory remains as Kamala Maia
 kamala kii kaaphi pracheen teen dharaayen mithilanchal kii ek prasiddh nadi 'jibach nadi' se milakar bahati thi, jiskaa namshesh ab 'jeevach nadi' ke rup main hi rah gaya he
 These ancient streams of Kamla flowed west from the jayanagar-madhubani railroad, while the later currents flowed east from the jayanagar-madhubani railroad
 ye hi dharaayen vastutah 'kamala nadi' ke naam se prasiddh hai
 At present, Kamala flows through the relatively small river of Mithilanchal 'balan' and is often known as 'kamala-balan'
 yah balaan mithilanchal kii hi ek badi nadi 'bhutahibalan' se bhinn he
 The ancient route of the famous stream named Kamala has also dried up and history has been made
 kamala kii pracheen dhara bhi jayanagar ke nikat purvi bhaag ke rail maarg se praayah satee hui hi dakshin kii ore bahati hui jayanagar ke purvi bhaag ke vishaal chaur se hokar guzarati thi
 On the banks of this stream of Kamla, villages Brahmottara, Salera, Sukkhi, Bhakua, Maniyarwa and Khajuli used to fall
 sukkhi ke paas mithilanchal kii ek kaaphi choti nadi 'dhauri' kamala se milti thi
 This ancient stream of Kamla flowed between Khajuli railway station and Khajuli village
 is dhara kii daanyi ore pashchim main railway stesan tathaa baanyi ore purab main khajauli gaanv tha
 At that time the distance from the village to the station was about two and a half miles
 khajauli se dakshin lagbhag dhai-teen mile dur lalpur naamak gaanv tak jaakar kamala agnikon main mudati thi
 Near the village called Mirzapur, located 7 miles east of Madhubani, another stream of Kamala used to come towards Pariharpur and after that Rampatti flowing from Koilakh village west of Raghuveer Chak village flowing in Kamla Agni angle
 , Khangaon and Navhath reached the village
 navahath gaanv ke paas se kamala kii do dharaayen banati thi, jisamen se poorabi dhara bilkul samaapt ho gayi he
 This stream used to reach the village of Rampur and Madhopur in Agnogna near Lohat Mill and through the village of 'bhour'
 madhopur se yah pracheen dhara dakshin disha main mud kar sarisvapahi ke purv se darbhanga- jhanjharpur rail line ko padkar dakshin jaati thi
 It used to cross the railway line near Sukhware village, 3 miles west of Jhanjharpur
 is relline ke dakshin tathaa kamala kii is mritdhara ke daayen bhaag main pashchim disha main bisaul naamak gaanv he
 This Bisol village is different from the Bisol near Harlakhi
 yahan se yah pracheen dhara adhiktar agnikon main jhukati hui dakshin disha kii ore bahati thi tathaa lagama gaanv se guzarati hui madariyaa gaanv tak jaati thi or baheda ke purvottar bhaag main sthit pracheen chaur main samaapt ho jaati thi
 The place where this stream used to form its reservoir in Chaur is about 5 or 6 miles east-north direction from Behera
 navahath gaanv ke paas kamala kii jo duusari dhara pashchim kii ore mudati thi vah semuaar gaanv ke agni kone main pahunchakar sakari-madhubani rail line ko laanghakar uske pashchimi bhaag se sate-sate dakshin kii ore chalati hui dahibhat-narottam gaanv ko jaati thi
 This village is located on its left side and east of the railway line
 sakari main railway line laanghakar dakshin disha main bahati hui kamala kii yah dhara raghopur, nehra, maujampur tathaa sirirampur naamak gaanv ko pahunchati thi
 Nawada village east of Bahera is also situated on the left bank of this stream and Majhora village on the right bank
 is magaura gaanv se kamala kii yah dhara agni kone main chalati hui shripur-jagat gaanv hote hue harsinghpur ke paas pahunch kar dakshin disha main bahati hui vishunpur gaanv se hoti hui dumri tathaa birul ke pashchim main pahunchati thi
 Birol Bazar is located on the left bank of this stream of Kamla
 yahan se dakshin kii ore bahane par kamala samastipur jile ke singhia thane main pravesh karti thi or apni dhara ko agni kone main modate hue missi gaanv tak pahunchati thi
 From the village of Missi, near the village called Dakshin Mahri, this ancient branch coming through Tarasarai used to take the eastern stream of Jivach
 phir agni kone main bahati hui mohim khurd tathaa bisaria gaanv hote hue pipara gaanv ke paas uttar vahini ho jaati thi
 Then after some distance, flowing eastward, moving in the south direction, forming the boundary of darbhanga-saharsa district, flowing in the south direction, ithar, Simartok, Mahadev Math etc
 reached near the village
 pehle tilakpur ke purvottar kone main kamala kii is dhara kaa baagmati kii shakha 'kareh' se sangam hota tha; lekin ab kosi se sangam hota he
 To the west of the said Ithar village is the famous Shivasthan called Kusheshwar
 san 1954 i0 tak kamala uparivarnit dharamargo se hi bahati thi
 Those streams have now become its Chhadni river
 san 1954 i0 main kamala apana nijee dharamarg chhodkar achaanak mithilanchal kii ek choti nadi soni or bhutahi balaan se kaaphi pashchim bahane vaali ek anya 'balaan' naamak nadi ke pravaah maarg ko aatmsaat karke bahane lagi
 Presently, the Kamla stream flows southward near Jayanagar and enters Khajouli police station and takes the flow of the Soni river in the south-east angle of Bhatchora and Bhakua and northeast of chatra-gobraura
 
 soni nadi purv kaal main nepal kii tarai bhaag se bahakar aati hui madhubani jile ke kumrakhat gaanv ke purab tathaa kamtauliya ke pashchim se hokar bahati thi tathaa chhaorahi evam baruaar gaanv ke paas hoti hui kamala ke tatbandh main samaa jaati thi
 Now its name has disappeared
 ukt sthaan se soni ke hi dharamarg se bahati hui kamala babubarahi ke pashchim 'piparaghat' naamak prasiddh sthaan par balaan nadi se milti he tathaa uske aage balaan ke astitv ko samaapt karti hui usee ke dharamarg ko apana banaakar vartmaan main bah rahi he
 The current Dhamaarga of Kamla which is ahead of Pipraghat was actually the Dharamarga of the said Balan river earlier
 balaan ko aatmsaat karne ke baad kamala kii yah aadhunik dhara bhatgamaa, bithuni, chapahi, gangadwar tathaa imadpattee gaanv ke paas pahunchati he
 To the south of Imadpatti the ancient route from Madhubani to a village called Sangram crosses Kamala
 yah ghat pehle balaan nadi kaa ghat tha, parantu ab yah kamala nadi kaa ghat kehalaata he
 This ghat is famous as Kandarpi Ghat
 kandarpi ghat ke paas se dakshin kii ore bahati hui kamala maharail gaanv tak pahunchati he or phir mahinathpur hoti hui jhanjharpur pahunchati he
 Jhanjharpur has a railway bridge over the Kamla River
 iske baad kamala kii yah aadhunik dhara ratul tathaa gangapore naamak gaanv ke paas se bahati hui 'raja kharwar' ke pashchim main aakar dakshin-purv kone main mudati hui jadupatty, padari, dohatha aadi gaanvon se bahati hui suprasiddh gaanv bheeth bhagavanpur tak pahunchati he
 Bhith Bhagwanpur is located east of Kamla
 dohatha gaanv ke purab main pehle balaan nadi tilyuga se milti thi, parantu ve nadiyaan ab samaapt ho gayi hai tathaa vahiin ab balaan ko aatmsaat karne vaali kamala kaa sangam kosi nadi se hota he
 In this way the mouth of Kamala now consists of the Kosi river

 aaryon kii shakhayein-prasakhayein itani bad gayi hai ki us andhkaar main itihaas ke panne ulatna badi vikat samasya he
 One wonders at that, there are mainly two grounds of the entire ancient history - one is Vedic literature and the other is the discovery of different surfaces of the earth on geographical basis
 din-din hamaare itihaas ko nav-nav prakaash miltaa ja rahaa he
 Arya-chhārī is meeting us in the form of an old age or pralika
 vaidic sahitya kii vyaakhyaan kaa rup din-din viksit or gambheer hota ja rahaa he
 To be honest, Vedic literature is becoming literature of the world
 isamen sabhi samaan rup se dilchaspee le rahe hai
 No one can say what will be the shape of our Aryan history in future and what will be our international relations
 hamaara samast sahitya vishwa kaa sahitya ho rahaa he
 Who can say that our philosophy, literature and history will one day not become philosophy, literature and history for the world? The world is repeating what the Aryans have done today; And will probably reach where we once went and went astray
 yah ek aitihaasik satya he
 It will be revealed to everyone one day
 isi se kaha jaataa he ki antar-rashtriya milan kaa ekmaatr aadhaar bharatvarsh hoga; kyonki uski kunjee isi ke haath mein he
 Yes, our history has become a bit like Mythology today due to lack of evidence
 puraana gapp-sa ban gaya he or ramayana or mahabharat ko roopak kaa rup mil gaya he ! yah hamaare liye laachaari or lajja kii baat he
 Indian scholars are trying to solve this problem
 vidwadwar shriyut ke
 pi
 jaiswal ne, bihar or orissa-research-socity ke jarnal main, garg-samhita ke ek adhyay ke aadhaar par yah saaf-saaf sabit kar diya he ki bharatvasi itihaas likhnaa jaanate the, tathaa garg ke aitihaasik adhyay se ham pracheen rajvansh ke itihaas tak nirvighn pahunch ja sakate hai
 It is expected that in the very near future, a well-written history from the Mahabharata to this day will come before us
 garg-samhita kaa aitihaasik vivaran greek vidwaanon ke us aitihaasik vivaran se mil jaataa he, jo unhone bharatvarsh ke bare main likhaa he
 This effort of Jaiswalji can create an epoch in the historical world
 apaar sanskrit-sahitya ke anushilan se hi ham apane itihaas kii khoj karne main safal manorath ho sakate hai
 Lokmanya Tilak has become our guide; Now we have to move forward
 hamen is lekh main bhugolic aadhaar par bharat ke pracheen itihaas ke digdarshan karaane kaa praytn karnaa he
 In this connection, we can know a lot from the geographical descriptions of the Upanishads, Puranas and Mahabharata
 shrimadbhagwat main to bhugol kaa purna kaakaa hi khinchaa gaya he
 In this article i will try to prove only on the basis of geography that the Aryans did not come from the side of Kabul in India and came from the path of Kashmir and settled on the banks of the Indus-river all over Punjab
 punjab se ve pashchimottar kii ore badhate-badhate kabul nadi ke aas-paas tak pahunch gayi or vahiin par aaryon kii us shakha se unki muthbhed hui, jo oxs-nadi ke pashchimottar-pradesh Airya nem Vaejo arthath ’aryaanaa vrajah’ se aaryon kii bhartiya shakha se vilag ho gayi
 He did not agree with the Indian Aryans, and he began to call the Indian Aryans as deities
 bhartiya arya unhen ’asur’ kah kar pukaarte the
 The word 'asura' in the Rigveda does not have the same meaning as it is understood today
 pehle ’asu raati laati dadaati iti asurah’ arthath devtaa ke arth main ’asur’ shabd prayukt hota tha
 Now it has become meaning 'na surah asurah'
 irani aaryon se bhartiya aaryon kii ladaai kaa mukhya kaaran batalaana to mushkil he, parantu itnaa kaha ja saktaa he ki is dwesh kaa kaaran kuch to aarthik or kuch dharmik tha
 We see in the Rigveda that the number of Devas of Aryans increases gradually
 avesta main vaidic sahitya ke brahman bhaag kaa koi bhi sanket nahin miltaa
 Yes, like the Rigveda, there are mantras and sutras present in the jinda-avesta
 mantra kaa rup usamen ’manthran’ he
 The holy texts of the Zoroastrians are named 'manthra-svant'
 avesta ke devataaon main- jo bhartiya aaryon se milte-julate hai-mitra, varun, aryaman or yami he
 In the Vedic literature, the Aryans gained development day by day
 vichaar-dhara shaashvat rup se bahati gayi
 Geographical Position and Criticism of Indian Aryans and Zoroastrians - Now after taking proper consideration of the geographical position of Indian and Zoroastrians, i will explain how the pattern of geography described in Indian literature is different from the geography of Avesta
 pehle main sankshep main vaayu-puraana main varnit jambudweep main aaye deshon kii suchi detaa hoon- Idam hamvatan varshan bharatam naam visrutam
 hemakuta paran tasmaat namna kimpurushan smritam
 naishadhan hemkutat tu harivarshan taduchyate
 Harivarshat paranchaiv merosh tadilavrittamilavrittaat nilam ramyakam naam vishrutam
 ramyaat paran shwet vishrutan tat hiranmaum
 hiranmayaat paran chaapi shrungavanstu kuruh smritam
 Havvat year means famous India year, uske baad hemkut parvat he, jise kimpurush desh kehete hai, After Hemkut is Naishdh, which is called Harivarsha, harivarsh ke baad meru-parvat ke uttar ilaavruth he, After Elawrita is the Nile Year, which is famous as 'ramyak', ramyak ke uttar shwet-pradesh he, jise hiranmay kehete hai or After Hiranmay is Shringwan, who is famous by the name Kuru
 is prakaar jambudweep ke antargat vayupurana ke anusaar saat desh huye
 Kuru was the most northern of the seven countries
 yah ’kuru’ kahan he so brahmandpurana ke nimna-likhit shloke se spasht ho jaataa he- North sea, sea, south
 kurvah tatra tadvarshan punyan siddh-nishevitam
 This Kuru is situated on the south side of the northern sea
 yahan siddh purush rahete hai, jinka naam ’kuru’ he
 It must have been south of Kuru, which would be located in the northern circle of the North Pole
 isse lo
 tilak kii sammati ko koi aghat nahin pahunchataa
 But the question is, what is the relationship between this Kuru and the Bharat Khanda? i will solve it back
 tab tak yah dekh lenaa chaiye ki is kuru kaa hamaare puraanon main kaisaa varnan aayaa he
 The following verses of Padmapuran cannot be said to be unnecessary - uttaren tu shrungasy samudrante dwijottama
 Varshamairavatam name tasmat sringavatah paramna tu tatra suryagatih na jiryyanti cha manavaah
 chandramaashch sanakshatro jyotirbhoot evavrutah
arthath, shrung ke uttar samudr ke ant main airavat varsh he, jahaan ’dwijon main shreshth ’ rahete hai
 This year is after Shringwan and here neither the movement of the Sun nor the humans are old and the Sakshatra Moon shines in perpetuity
 yahan uttartam pradesh kuru na hokar airavat ho gaya he
 But according to Padmapuran, we find the North Kuru between this Meru and the Nile
 jaise- Dakshinen tu nilasya mero: parshve tathottare
 uttarah kurwa wipraah puneh siddhanishevitah
 In this verse, we definitely get the shadow of the universe, but Kuru has come here between North and Kuru, moving away from the regions near the North Pole, between Meru and Neel
 avashya hi yah aaryon ke sthaanantarit hone kaa suchak he
 The Aryans continue to move towards middle-asia and take with them the name of their beloved state, which has shifted from middle-asia to south, turning into bharat-khand as kuru-panchal
 yah main upsanhaar main dikhalaaoonga
 Till then i will prove by other proof how this Kuru has come in Mahabharata in Harivarsha
 mahabharat ke sabha-parv main arjuna kii vijay-yatra ke prasang main bhi uttar-kuru kaa ullekh aayaa he
 In this, the north-kuru people prove to be in Harivarsha
 yah harivarsh ab uttareey dhruv ke sameepvarti vrutt ke antargat nahin he
 It is told from the very south side and north of the territories of Mansarovar
 arjuna kaa vijay kram is prakaar he-vah pehle Crossing the White Mountains go to the place of the living of the Kimpurus, ie in the Kimpurush-yr, protected by the son of Drumaraja
 tadnantar unhen jitkar or unase kar le guhyakon se rakshit ’haatak’ naam ke desh main chale gayi
 After winning them too, he proceeded towards Mansarovar
 udhar haatak desh ke baad maansarovar ke nikat hi gandharvon kaa desh tha
 He also conquered this country and took the horses named as tittir-kilmish and Mandook - from Gandharvas
 isse uttar jane par unhen harivarsh mila
 Here Mahakavya, Mahavirya the gatekeepers stopped their movement by pleading
 un logon ne kaha ki yahan manushyon kii gati nahin, yahan uttar-kuru ke log rahete hai; yahan kuch jeetne yogya chiz bhi nahin
 Even upon entering here, o Parth, you will not see anything nor is there anything visible from a human body
 un logon ne punah parth kii manovanchhaa kii jaanch kii
 Partha said that i only want to accept the virtue of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira
 isaliye yudhisthir ke liye kar-panya kii aavashyaktaa he
 Hearing this, they gave divine clothes, cosmetics and divine gratitude

-- Today, almost all the rivers, giri and city found in the path of the cloud described by Kalidas have been known today
 kankhal yani haridwar tak yaa kailash tak to ham maan jate hai, parantu iske uttar gandharvon kii nagari alakapuri ko ham kori kalpana samajhate hai
 At least we are not willing to believe that this is also geographical truth
 arjuna shwet-parvat yani himalay paar kar uttar kii ore bade; parantu ise ham kavi-kalpana se badhkar or kuch maanane ke liye abhi taiyaar nahin
 The path of the cloud is even more imaginary
 parantu iske purv ham yah dikhalaanaa chahenge ki buddha log kis prakaar himalay ke uttar-pradeshon se apana sambandh rakhte hai
 Principal of bihar-national College Shriyut Devendranath Sen MA, IES In his essay entitled trans-himalayan-reminiscences in Pali-literature, it has shown very well why Buddhists had so much influence in the North Himalayan region and why the Buddhists became so much loved by the neighboring areas of Mansarovar
 unhone buddha jaatakon ke aadhaar par yah siddh kiya he ki bhartiya aaryon kaa prem himalayottar-pradesh se kuch naiysargik-sa tha
 We cannot reject their conclusions
 mahabharat ke pashchaat ke itihaas kaa digdarshan gargacharya ne apni garg-samhita main kiya he
 It has been written above that Shriyut K
 P
 Jaiswal has described the history of the era from Janamejaya to Christ to two centuries ago, based on the chapter called 'yuga-purana' of Gargasamhita in the Journal of Behar & Orissa Research Society
 gargacharya ne krishna kii mrityu ke baad se bhartiya itihaas likhaa he
 Their history is also confirmed by ancient postures, records of foreign scholars and independent evidence
 unhone janamejay or brahmanon ke bich vaimnasy kaa zikr kiya he
 The second thing, which is known from the garga-samhita, is that after the Mahabharata, gradually the center of Brahmin religion shifted from Taxila to Pataliputra in Magadha
 janamejay kii rajdhani takshashila he or uski brahmanon se shatruta he
 After Mahabharata, there is definitely a sign of movement against Brahmin religion i
e
 Vedic religion
 aisa kyon hua, yah us samay kaa itihaas hi batala saktaa he
 According to Hindu system, the time of Mahabharata is considered to be about 3,000 years before Christ and this time can be proved to be true
 hamen vidit hi he ki khrisht se purv saatvin shatabdi ke madhya main buddhadev or mahavir-jain kaa udai hua
 Naturally, 2,400 years is not enough time for this religious revolution to be successful
 vaidic kaal se hi hamaare dharmik vichaar main parivartan hote aaye hai or hindu darshan ke kramik vikaas kaa bhi hamen pataa mil jaataa he
 Then we come from the monotheism of the Vedic period to the monotheism of the post-colonial period
 akeshwarwad ke baad hamen brahmavaad miltaa he, jisase veydant kii utpatti hui
 Mayanism is included in this Brahmanism
 sansar maaya kaa jaal or brahm hi ek satya samajha jaataa he
 But after the booming of Brahmanism and Mayavism, the movement of man and nature-consciousness is awakened
 brahm purush or maaya prakruti ban jaati he
 This thought development must have taken sufficient time
 aate-aate sutrakaal main hamen kapil kaa sankhya-sutara miltaa he
 Although Sankhyakarika appeared in the form of a specific philosophy long after the rise of Sankhyadharma, we do not think of giving it at least 5-6 hundred years before Buddhism
 mcdaneld mahoday bhi khrishtabd se 1,000 varsh purv sankhyadharm kaa udai hona to kam-se-kam sweekaar hi karte hai
 We consider the semi-physical religion of Sankhya as the root cause of the religion of Buddhists or Jains
 kapil apane vichaar ke kaaran naastik samajhe gayi
 Gradually, atheism developed for 400 years, as understood at the time
 inhen chaar-sau varshon main charvak aadi kaa bhi pradurbhaav hua
 After atharva-kaal, we also see the beginning of tantra-dharma
 dhire-dhire yah tantravaad jor pakadta gaya or vaidic dharm kaa rup vikrut hota gaya
 This systemicism was probably the root cause of Shakta-dharma
 gautam buddha ke samay tak saadhaaran janamanas main hinsa kaa purnatah prachaar ho gaya hoga
 From the time of Parikshit's son Janmejaya, ill-feelings began to spread against the Brahmins and this is the reason that Brahmadharmarmalambi Arya left Takshshila and came towards Magadha
 garg-samhita ke acharya gargaji brahmandharm kaa anuyaayi hone ke kaaran avashya hi buddha yaa uske purv ke itihaas kaa digdarshan karaane se baaj aaye se maaloom padate hai
 To tell the truth, Sanskrit literature itself is absolutely silent about this subject
 vah avashya hi paraspar vidroh or ashaanti kaa samay rahaa hoga
 Historical texts must have been present in front of Garg; But in those texts the story of atheists is not written, it seems possible
 faltah buddha sahitya ke anushilan ke bina bhartiya itihaas kaa puraa pataa nahin paa sakate
 Nevertheless, according to the context, we will describe the Himalayan regions in Buddhist natives
 yadhyapi ye galpavat prathit hote hai, tathaapi ham uttar kuru ke sachche astitv kaa pataa paa jate hai
 In 'milindapanh', 'sagal' has been compared to the city of north-kuru, such as 'uttarakuru Sankasana Samasya Sasan'
 vidhur pandit ke jataka main bhi ham uttar-kuru ke dakshin main jambudweep ko pate hai
 It should be remembered that here, Jambudweep was considered special India
 jaise-purato videhe pass goyaaniye c pachchhato karuyo
 Jambudeepanchas pas manimhi pas nimittan, yet within this we get the following sentence - Videheti Puvvideenh Goyaniriyati upargoyanidipam; Kuryo ti Uttarkuru f Dakshinato Jambudipanch
 arthath videh purv-videh ko, goyanirya apargoyani-dweep ko, kuru uttar-kuru ko or uske dakshin jambudweep ko kehete hai
 This proved north-kuru to be north of the Himalayas
 is uttar-kuru ke basinde bhi jambudweep ke basindon se achche samajhe gayi hai
 Like Tihi Bhikkhave Thanei Uttarkuruka Manusa Deve Ch Tavatinsh Adhumanthi Jambudeepke Ch Manusse
 katameti tihi ? amana c, apariggaha, niyatayuka, vicesabhujo
 That is, in all three things, the humans of north-kuru and the gods of Tawatins are different from the humans of Jambudweep
 ve teen koun-koun si ? ve nirmam hai yani mayarahit hai, parigrah nahin lete, amar hai tathaa koi vishesh bhojan khaane vaale hai
 Shriyut Devendranath Sen has proved to be the Manasarovar of Anatottamahasar on the basis of 'palisutta'
 paali-sutron main saat nadiyon kaa varnan paaya jaataa he; jaise-anotatt, sinhapapaat, rathkaar, kannmund, kunal, chhddhant or mandakini
 The rivers originating from the Himalayas are Ganga, Yamuna, Achiravati, Sarbhu and Mahi
 ’sarabhu’ sambhavtah sarayu or achiravati vaidic kaal kii sadanira he
 Mahi is a famous river of North Bihar
 anotatt kaa arth anavatapt he
 According to sources, this lake is in north-kuru; Because in Uttarkuru, Bodhisattvas and Buddhist monks used to pay alms, resting in a unique spirit
 The Uttar Kurus who play a mythical part in the epic and later literature, are still a historical people in the aitarey brahman where they are located beyond the Himalayas 
 In another passage, however, the country of the Uttar Kurus is stated by Vashishtha Satyahavya to be a land of Gods, but jaanantapi atyarati was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical
-keith
 The territory of the Kuru Panchal is declared in the ऐतरेय ब्राह्मण to be the middle country 
 a group of the Kuru people still remained further north-the Uttar Kurus beyond the Hiamlayas
 It appears from a passage of the शतपथ ब्राह्मण that the speech of the Norherners-that is presumably the Norhern Kurus-and of the Kuru Panchal was similar and regarded as specially pure
 There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical culture was developed in the country of the कुरुपांचाल and that it spread then east, south and west-macdonald
 spasht he ki uttar-kuru himalay ke uttar main he or aitarey brahman ke samay main yah ek aitihaasik pradesh rahaa he, jahaan se or kurupanchal se pratyaksh sambandh tha
 Probably Kurupanchal-residents are descendants and branches of north-kuru itself
 is uttar-kuru kaa bhugolic vikaas hamaare itihaas ke liye param ascharyajanak or mahatva kii chiz he
 This proves that the Aryans coming to the North Pole regions respectively from the Indus-river coasts to India, ie Jambudweep
 aaryon ke himalay kii tarai se aane ke liye kai maarg ho sakate hai
 It extends from Kashmir to Tibet
 is sankatapann maarg kaa sanket hamen rugveda ke sutron se bhaleebhanti mil jaataa he
 From where the Iranian Aryans separated from the Indian Aryans, it will be told further
 hamaara sahitya himalayottar pradesh kii punya-smritiyon se otprot he
 Nobody ever noticed towards Kabul
 kyon ? yah ham upsanhaar bhaag main dikhalaayenge
 The notion of the existence of heaven has not gone through our mind yet
 yah hamaari vikat bhul hogi, yadi ham is pratyaksh aitihaasik tathy ko khule dil se sweekaar na karen
 The second thing that is not capable of being forgotten is that Buddhism was widely propagated north of the Himalayas
 is naiysargik prachaar kaa mul kaaran bhi naiysargik ho saktaa he
 The descriptions of Chinese travelers Fahian and Huanseang suffice for this
 fahyaan ko, bharat main pravesh ke purv, khoton aadi sthanon main buddha dharm kaa purnatah prachaar mila
 Thousands of monks from hinayana-panth went north
 shenesen main hinayan or khoton main mahayan-sampradaay kaa prachaar paaya gaya
 Sanskrit and Pali were dominated everywhere
 huensang ko, jo gobi kii marubhumi se aayaa, bhartiya lipi se hi milti-julati lipi gobi ke aasapaas ke pradeshon main mili
 Idol of Buddhadev, Sangaram and many temples were also found
 vah akshu se hota hua oxs kii tarai main aayaa or vahaan se balkh chalaa gaya
 This Balkh was called Rajagriha due to the multiplicity of its temples
 aashcharya nahin, yadi sar arelsten ko khoton kii baluka ke andar sanskrit or praakrit ke gade hue granth mili
 There are Sanskrit and Prakritamay till the name of the cities
 principal sen ke anusaar yah bharatvarsh se purv turkistan ke paraspar-sansarg kaa achook sambhavneey pramaan he
 This connection will be before the Vedic civilization also
 ab ham apni lakshya-purti ke liye un aaryon kii ore pathakon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karte hai, jo bhartiya shakha se alag ho iran kii ore chale gayi
 We have said above that the Indian Aryans separated during that time of remembrance, when the number of their Vedic deities was not greatly increased
 ’aryaanaa vrajah’ kahan he-iskaa spashtikaran hi in donon shakhaon ke antim milan kaa itihaas hoga
 He must have been separated when he lived in 'aryan Vrajah'
 sen mahoday ne oxs-nadi ke kahin pashchimottar-pradesh main iskaa hona batalaaya he
 Therefore, it can be somewhere in the south-east region of the Caspian or Kashyap Sea
 zendavesta ke bhugolic varnan se yah baat spasht ho jaaygi
 But before the geographical description, it is reasonable to decide what could be the reason for this mutual disharmony of the Aryans
 kashyap rishi kii do patniyon se daityon or adityon kii utpatti kii katha sabko vidit he
 It is quite possible that Kashyapa Rishi should have lived around kashyapa-sagar
 daitya or aditya kii katha main devasur-sangharsh kaa abhas mil jaataa he
 The Zoroaster, the presiding deity of the Zoroastrians, has been called 'manthran' in Zendavesta
 aaryon ke pracheen ishtdev parsi or bhartiya aaryon ke bilkul ek hi hai
 Zoroaster started rebelling against the deity worshipers as soon as there were differences with the Aryans
 rugveda ke pracheen sookhton main sur or asur kii bhinnata na hone par peeche yah bhedbhaav bahut prabal ho gaya he
 Deodals against the Asuras and Asadalas against Deodals have appeared behind
 aashcharya to yah he ki jis tarah faras yani iran main dev kaa arth rakshas ho gaya he, usee prakaar bharatvarsh main bhi asur kaa arth rakshas hi samajha jaataa he ! musalamaanon ke "hindu" shabd kii vyakhya main bhi yahi bhedbhaav sannihit paaya jaataa he, jiskaa arth ve kuch or hi karte hai
 At least it is certain that the Indian and Parsi Aryans got separated from each other for something big
 dharmik vikaas adhiktar bhartiya aaryon ke hi dwaara hua
 From this it can be concluded that the inclination of the Indian branch was more towards this and their ideology kept increasing day by day
 chaahe ye donon dal oxs-nadi ke asann praanton se vilag hue hon chaahe or kisi sthaan se, parantu ve alag hue vikat vaimnasy ke baad ! yah baat tab or bhi pusht ho jaati he, jab ham dekhte hai ki donon shakhaon ke maarg do ho gayi
 The Iranian branch found a comfortable route and the Indian branch had to take refuge in the mountainous regions
 rugveda kii ek-ek pankti se, path kii durgamata dur karne ke liye, ek aahabhari deen prarthana prakat hoti he
 On arrival in India, the Aryans did not have such difficulty that they had to cry to the presiding deities to destroy tyrannical enemies on foot
 atyaachaar-priy anya shakha se haar maanakar hi inhen yah maarg pakadana padaa hoga
 Before making sure that the Aryans came from the Himalayas from the north to the south, and inaugurated the Kurukshetra in the memory of their ancient north-kuru spreading to the Kurukshetra of Aryavarta, it is necessary to know that the Iranians How did the branch come here and settled down and how was its condition and attitude over the years
 ahur mazd ne, jo irani shakha ke zoroster-sampradaay ke nayak the, 16 pradesh basaaye the, jinamein nimnlikhit pradeshon kaa aadhunik pradeshon se milan ho chukaa he- It is clear from the above table that the Iranian branch was separated from the Indian branch and the first initiative was in 'aryan Vrajah'
 iskaa arth he ki aaryon kii bhoomi
 It is clear from this nomenclature that they too preferred to name their habitat in memory of the word Arya
 yah vraj Vanguhi Daliya par basaa hua samajha jaataa he
 This river was somewhere northwest of the oxus-river
 iske baad ve log kramshah samarkand, marv, balkh, heraat, kabul or saptsindhu arthath punjab kii ore badhate gayi
 One thing in this geographical description, which we have to consider, is that just as our literature has a gradual description of the Himavant and Jambudweep starting from Meru or north-kuru to Kimpurushvarsha etc
, in the same way and in the same way Iranians a continuation of the speed of is also found
 kisi bhi sudhi ko ek nazar daalane se yah spasht vidit ho jaataa he ki donon shakhaon ke do bhinn-bhinn maarg hai; do bhugolic sampradaay hai; donon ke viyog ke anantar bhinn-bhinn devtaa hai ! ek baat or; ’aryaanaa vrajah’, Celestial Mountain -jiskaa naam Thianshan bhi he-ke thik nikatavartti pradesh hai
 The rebellion of the two branches becomes even more convincing when we see that Indra, who is the adorable god of the Indian branch, is a devilish demon for the Zoroastrians
 rugveda kii richaayen isaki sakshi hai
 Indra, whose Aryans are very grateful, repeatedly listens to praise his valor
 unhone asuron kaa dal-bal nasht kar aaryon kii sahaayta kii he
 He is always in the forefront in the fight between Dev and Asuras
 indra inhen swargeey parvaton par rahete the
 The direction of sumeru-parvat is found in the Thianshan or Celestial or heavenly mountains
 avashya hi sur or asuron kaa yah ghor yuddh iran ke purvi seemaa-praant main hua hoga
 Merv was sinful and destroyed — corrupted as Vendidad described
 isi prakaar nishay jo marv or balkh ke antargat tha, paap or naastikta kaa pariposhak tha, heraat ashrupat or vikal vednaa se paritapt tha; or Vaekereta yaa kabul main butaparasti bad rahi thi, tathaa kirissp devpoojak ban gayi the
 When and where these two branches separated, it is difficult to estimate precisely; But it can be estimated that they had two teams somewhere in the south of the Oxus and adjacent areas of Thianshan or meru-parbat-mala
 indra bhartiya shakha ke pramukh jaan padate hai
 There would have been a second party led by Ahuramazd
 ek kaa duusare ko vidharmee samajhnaa tathaa ek kaa duusare ke ishtdev ko daitya bananaa dharmik ashishnutaa kii paraakaashtha he
 Astu instructs Merv, Balkh, Iran, Kabul and Saptasindhu from Zenda Avesta 'aryanan Vrajah'
 isse yahi nishkarsh nikaal sakate hai ki irani shakha yani parsi, aaryon se vilag ho, iran kii adhityaka ko tay karte hue kabul kii raah se saptsindhu tak fail gayi
 The Indian branch also came by way of Kabul, this is a very doubtful principle
 jab ham dekhte hai ki zendavesta apane bhugol kaa maanchitr is prakaar khinchataa he tathaa vaidic sahitya kaa kabul se hi apana bayaan prarambh kar purv kii ore badhata he, tab ham do hi nishkarsh par pahunch sakate hai- ek to yah ki arya logon ke saptsindhu se hi do dal ho gayi or irani shakha saptsindhu se pashchimottar-pradesh kii ore bad chali
 And secondly, the Indian branch came directly from the north by the way of the Indus-river and spread in the Saptasindhu and started moving towards the east
 isi bich main, jab ki pamir, karakoram or sindhu ke maarg se kabul tak fail gayi, irani shakha bhi purv nirdisht maarg se kabul tak fail gayi
 Probably he again encountered Iranians here
 donon shakhaon kaa lakshya saptsindhu kii ore hi tha, yah ek sandeh kii baat ho sakati he; parantu ham zaraa adhik vichaar karke dekhte hai, to saafe prakat ho jaataa he ki donon dal ke vistaar ke liye doosraa koi kshetra nahin tha
 Gobi's desert appears just a little east of Thianshan
 us samay is marubhumi kaa kya rup tha, so to thik-thik nahin kaha ja saktaa; parantu yaa to yah samudr tha yaa jaisaa kuch bhootatvavisharadon kaa kathan he, yaa yah pahari-dhoosarit chattaanon kii raashi thi
 The philosophers state that Siberia must have been part of central-asia at the same stage as it is today
 siberia main pracheen kaaleen van ke chihn milte hai or aisa anumaan kiya jaataa he ki kisi samay isaki aabhohawaa aisi thi ki manushya yahan rah sakate the
 This meant that there was no other option for the Indian branch to go beyond Mansarovar to Tibet
 sambhavtah ve bharatvarsh main ek hi baar nahin aaye, apitu samay samay par apni suvidhanusaar aate rahe
 In the Rigveda verses, the adoration of Iran's dominion or the western regions of Kabul gives an idea of the memory of the Himalayan region - the study of the Rigveda will show that the natural scenes of which the Arya-sage is enchanted by his simple refined poem That Anjali used to dedicate, those natural views are accessible on or just across the iceberg
 un stutipurna kavitaaon main ve prakruti kaa drishy khinchate tathaa apane mangal or vibhav kii abhyarthna karte hai
 The Sukta is a living picture of the memory of the Suktas or folklores, based on which the Aryans describe the Aryans as residents of the Himalayan regions
 sambhavtah aaj koi bhi lo
 tilak ke siddhanton kaa khandan safaltaapurvak nahin kar saktaa
 Even if Arya had been a resident of the nearby circle of the North Pole for the first time and had settled here in the Siberia plain, it would have to be accepted that he came from the same direction and till the end, settling in Aryavarta, his virtue-memory Keep it fresh
 uttar-kuru ke bhugolic nirdesh se yah spasht hi prakat ho jaataa he ki arya log ant tak ’kuru’ shabd se prem rakhte gayi
 This historical and geographical sequence of the Aryans is as true as it is to develop philosophy and astrology by contemplating their natural scenes
 rugveda ke koun sookt kab rache gayi, yah sandigdh hone par bhi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki koun sa sookt kis vishay ko nirdisht kar rahaa he
 We give below those Suktas, after which all the Vedic scholars have begun to explain after Tilak - Ami or Raksha Nihitas Uchcha Naksant Darshe Kuhichte Diveyayu? Adhidhani Varunasya Vratani Considerate Moon Naktameti
 arthath ve riksh, jo ucch gagan-mandal main sthit hai, raat main dekhe jate hai
 Where do they go during the day? No one can deny Varun's works
 unheen kii ajna se chandramaa raat main chandani dete hai
 This Richa must have been made at a time when the Aryans had migrated from the regions of the North Pole to this place
 tilak mahoday ne richaon ke bal par yah dikhalaayaa he ki ve jahaan rahete the, vahaan ek hi tara baraabar prakashit tha, jahaan din kam or raat bahut badi hoti thi
 This is a picture of Northern Territories
 uparyukt richa vahiin bani, jahaan din-raat kram se hote rahe honge or chandramaa kaa bhi udai hota hoga
 Pavapayanti mountain vivinchanti vegetation
 pro aarat maruto durmada ive devasah sarvatha visha
arthath parvaton ko hilaate hue, vrikshon ko giraate hue, he maruto ! tum madmatt devon kii bhanti abaadh rup se chalate ho
 Dasapatnirigopa akshisht niruddha aappannev gavah
 apaan vilamapi hitan yadasit vrutran jaghanva ap tat vawar
arthath pani dwarachipaayi gaayon kii bhanti jal vrutra dwaara jo unke pati or swami hai, roak diya gaya
 Indra slaughtered Vritra and cleared the passage, which caused the water to flow, which was stopped by Vritra
 uparyukt varnan rishiyon kaa ankhon dekha he
 Vritra means cloud
 praayah pahari nadiyaan, jo bahudhaa sukhi rahati hai, varsha hone par zoron se umadakar bahane lagati hai
 From the second Richa, the tree-vibrations caused by mountain storms are clearly exposed
 yah drishy panchanad kii samabhumi par sambhav nahin
 It is a memory of the time when Aryans must have lived in the mountainous regions of the Himalayas
 ek duusari richa jo rugveda ke dwitiya mandal ke 15wein sookt main he, spasht kar detii he ki arya log sindhu nadi ke udgamasthan, kashmir ke purvottar-pradesh, maansarovar ke nikat, paas se punjab main aaye
 This is the following ritha-sodancham Sindhumarinat Mahitva Vajrenan Ushas: Sampipev
 ajwaso javinibhih vivrushchan somasy ta mad indrashchakaar
arthath indra ne apni mahatta se sindhu-nadi ko uttar kii ore baha diya tathaa ushaa ke rath ko apni prabal teevr sena se nirbal kar diya
 Indra does this when he becomes engrossed with soma item
 sindhu-nadi apane udgam-sthaan maansarovar se kashmir tak uttar-munh hokar bahati he; kashmir ke baad dakshin-pashchim-mukhi hokar bahati he
 Probably Indra has cut the mountain inaccessible road, broadened the narrow path of Indus-river and cleared the river stream towards the north
 isse aaryon kaa maarg bahut sugam ho gaya hoga
 This view is further strengthened by the following rcha - Indrasya nu veeryani pravacham i
e
 Chakar Pratharamani Vajri
 ahan ahi manvpastatard pravakshna abhinat parvvatanam
 That is, i will describe the effortless actions of Indra which he first took
 unhone ahi yani megh ko maaraa; jal ko neeche laaye or parvaton ko jalmaarg banane ke nimitt kaata 
 Only after this, the eighth verse of this Sukta is as follows - Nāndā v भिन्नnāmamuya shayanam mano ruhana atiyanti aap
 yah chit vrutro mahina paryatishthat trasamahih yatsutah shirbabhuv
 arthath thik jis prakaar nadi dhahe hue kagaaron par umadakar bahati he, usee prakaar prasann jal pade hue vrutra par bah rahaa he
 The Vritra, who kept the water alive with his power, kept it under his feet
 yah drishy pahari pradeshon ke drishy kaa samaran dilaataa he
 Flocks and rows of black and black clouds, lightning, thunder and thunder, and the end of rainfall at the time of rain and unbreakable stream of water, disappeared! Seeing such a captivating heart-rending scene - in which the clouds reside at the head of the mountains and when it rains, the fissures merge lightly - it is perfectly natural to draw this picture of the Aryans
 aisi richaayen prachur maatra main milti hai
 The dynamics of the Iranian branch is given for comparative study- rugveda or zenda-avesta donon main uttareey dhruv ke nikatavarti pradeshon kii lambi chah maheene vaali raaton kii smriti vidyaman he
 Lokmanya Tilak's theory of the Aryans living in the regions of the North Pole and the Aryans living in those Dhruva provinces thousands of years ago based on Jyotirgana is known as Dhruva
 vahaan se mahapralay ke uparant Post Glacier Period main ve log siberia ke vistrut bhubhag main, sambhavtah aadhunik ural parvatashrenee se purv or pashchim donon ore fail gayi honge
 According to the legends, Siberia must have been in a suitable habitable climate at that time, as inferred from the skeletons of plants and animals found inside that ground
 maine uresia kaa ek maanchitr apni suvidha ke liye taiyaar kiya he, jo is lekh ke saath nahin diya gaya he
 In it, i have drawn the motion of the Aryans by comparing ancient and ancient names
 yah chitra kaalpanik hone par bhi lokmaanya ke siddhanth ke samarthan ke saath-saath puraana tathaa mahakavyon main varnit bhugolic kram kii purna paripushti karata he
 It will be clear from this that the writers of the Puranas and the epic had a memory of their ancient eternal history and geography
 ve apane aadi-nivas-sthal kaa punya-samaran kar unki vividh prashansa karte hai
 They consider those places to be sacred and imagine various pleasures there
 buddha sahitya, jiskaa in dinon zoron ke saath adhyayan ho rahaa he, is vishay par prakaash daalata he
 Sanskritism is found in the names of the Himalayan regions and mountain ranges
 main uttar-dhruv se armbh kar, aise shabd-samya kaa digdarshan kara aaryon kii pracheen sthiti kii ek jhalak dekhne kaa praytn karuunga
 In my fictitious map, i have mentioned the ancient names of Archaic and the ancient mythological names everywhere
 uttar-mahaasaagar ke dakshin karasagar or nova zembala dweep ke dakshin kora kaa muhaana he
 According to the Vayu Purana, Kuru is considered the northernmost state
 brahmand puraana ise uttar samudr ke tat hi par dakshin kii ore maanata he
 The Padmapuran considers Airavat to be south of north-sea and north of Shringwan-mountain instead of Kuru
 yah airavat, padmapurana ke anusaar aisa sthaan he jahaan surya kii gati bhi nahin he
 Therefore, the Kuru-year or north-kuru of the cosmic Purana has fallen into Padmapurana and in Padmapurana, north-kuru has come to central-asia, north near meru-parbat and south near nil-parbat
 vayupurana kaa kuru jambudweep kaa uttartam pradesh he; padmapurana main yah bharat or uttar dhruv ke bich main aa gaya he
 It signifies the arrival of the Aryans from the north, after the Great Depression, to Asia
 main vayupurana ke ’kuru’, ko jo uttar-samudr ke sameep yani dhruv-pradesh main he-kaara-sagar or kora ke muhane ke aas-paas ke sthalon main maanata hoon
 This kara-sagar is the north-sea of the padma-purana or the Brahmanda Purana
 yah kaara-sagar ke thik dakshin he
 What is now called North Sea is north of Europe
 kintu us samay jab arya log uttar-dhruv ke nearesth pradeshon main rahete the, kaara sagar hi uttar samudr kaa dyotak ho saktaa he
 The word Kuru is also closely related to the words 'kara' and 'kora'
 shrisvan-parvat kaa pataa lagaana kuch tedha avashya maaloom hota he; parantu iske arth par dhyaan dene se vidit hota he ki kisi parvat ko, jiske shikhar ho, shrungavan kaha ja saktaa he
 The Padmapurana assumes Airavat to occur after the north-sea ; And Shringa is to its south, so Airavat was decided to be between North Sea and Shringa
 is airavat-varsh main bhi surya kii gati nahin he
 The word Airavat is made of metal
 ’ir’ or ’il’ dhaatu jane ke arth main prayukt hai
 Therefore, 'ira' also means earth
 jal or saraswati ke arth main bhi iskaa prayog hua he
 Iravat means sea and similarly Eradhar and Iladhar means mountain
 iresh kaa prayog ham varun ke arth main karte hai
 The glory of Varuna is very much sung in the Rigveda
 indra ke samaan varun bhi dhire-dhire aaryon ke pradhan devtaa ban gayi hai
 Iravat means sea, Airavat can mean beach dweller
 uttareey dhruv ke pradeshon main surya kii gati nahin he
 Even in Airavat, sunlight is considered weak
 chunki yah airavat-shrung ke uttar he, atev ural-parvatashrenee ke uttar-sthit pradeshon ko aisa maan lene main koi aadchan nahin jaan padati
 It is astonishing to see that such words have started coming from the region of Central Asia to Persia or Afghanistan and the Arvali-mountain range of India from the north-pole
 yahi ural-parvatashrenee aaryon kaa doosraa adda ho saktaa he
 Places around here are indicative of Airavat country
 ural-parvat se ’ural’ naam kii ek nadi bhi nikalati he
 This river falls in the caspian-sea
 ’ira’ kaa arth jal hone se iralay kaa arth nadi ho jaataa he
 The European branch of the Aryans probably separated itself from the surrounding regions of the Ural-mountain range
 iskaa naam ilaaspad or iraaspad donon ho saktaa he
 If we consider this place as questionable or doubtful, then in the nomenclature of Europe, we get the impression of Erasp
 swami dayanand ne yorape kii tulana harivarsh se kii he
 Hari also means yellow and monkey
 harinetra kaa arth pili ankhwala bhi he
 It can also be the name of Harivarsha Europe; But the principal has mentioned this year between the north of the Pamir-mountain range and the southern regions of Thianshan
 chunki arya log apane priy naamon ko jahaan gayi, apane saath lete gayi, isaliye harivarsh ko yorape maanane main koi baadha nahin
 The rationalism of Europeans also seems to be rational
 peeche se harivarsh himalayottar-pradesh ho gaya
 In its internal air purifier, Hiranmayavarsh has been mentioned
 hiranmay ke baad shwet-parvat or uske baad ramyak-varsh he
 Nilaparvat is followed by Ramayakavarsha and then it is covered
 ham asia ke maanchitr main in paanch sthanon kaa kramik nirdesh karte hue ilaavruth kaa nirdesh Elburz -parvat se kar sakate hai
 It extends to the northwest of the Albertian Caspian Sea
 in pahari pradeshon ke uttar kakesus parvat he
 The land of the adjacent region of the Caucasus Mountains was considered as the land of the Aryans before Lokmanya Tilak
 yadi elbarz ke aasapaas aaryon ke ilaavruth-desh ko maan len to kakesus, jo nil-sagar ke uttar-purv he, nil-parvat kaa sthaan grahan kar saktaa he
 The Vayupurana tells of the Ramayakavarsha after the Nilaparvata
 sambhavtah arya log airawatvarsh se dakshin kii ore ural-nadi ke tatavarti pradeshon se aakar cospian-sagar se uttar, kakesus se asian turki ke arab-sagar tak fail gayi hon
 This region is beautiful due to the valley of the Ural Mountains and the mountainous region is very less here
 bahut sambhav he, is ramyak-bhoomi ke uttar ural kii parvatashrenee main koi shwetaparvat bhi rahaa ho
 Shwetasagar still exists on the west side of Korasagar
 vayupurana, airavat ke baad shrungavan or shrungavan ke baad hiranmay varsh kaa hona batalaata he
 This Hiranmayavarsh may have been towards the south-west of Airavatavara around the ural-mountains
 athwa ho saktaa he, yah ural-parvatashrenee ke pashchim se ural-nadi ke tat tak failaa hua ho
 The Aryans residing in the territories of Central Asia and the separation of the Indian and Iranian branches from there - there is doubt whether the Aryans came to Aryan Vrajah from aryal-sagar after Ramayakavarsha or before the caspian-sagar East after Albarz
 And spread towards the airel-sea
 airal-sagar ke airavat se samya hone ke kaaran sambhav he
 Some people may have migrated to the Airel through the Ural-riverine territories, and some have passed through the Arya Caucasus, yet later have spread to the airel-sea on the banks of the Oxus River towards the earlier territories of the caspian-sea
 chunki aaryon kii donon shakhaayen isi oxs nadi ke tatavarti pradeshon se alag hui bataayi jaati hai or chunki irani aaryon kii pratham bhoomi ’aryaanaa vrajah’ he, isaliye ’aryaanaa vrajah’ kaa oxs-nadi ke uttar-pashchim kii ore hona nishchit kiya gaya he
 Wherever it may have been, the region must have been south of Airel, east-north of Oxus, and east of Caspian; Because after this the second territory of Iranians is enriched
 bhartiya shakha ’aryaanaa vrajah’ se hi iraniyon se alag hui, aisa prathit hota he
 The Tajik-nomadic Arya-caste living in eastern Turkey has been considered
 yahi peeche turki ke pahari pradeshon main ja basii or vahaan par yah aaj galch kahi jaati he
 The oxus-river originates from the airel-sea and it is undisputed that both branches once lived on both banks of the oxus-river
 jab ham turki main aaryon ke kabhi rahane kaa pataa pate hai or jab unamem bhartiya aaryon kii samskruti kaa abhas miltaa he, to yah kahana ki arya log oxs-nadi ke us bhaag se aaye, jo airal-sagar se armbh hokar nadi ke purvi tat par failaa hua he, ayukthik nahin he
 The Iranians moved towards Samarkand, Balkh and Merv and the Indian Aryashakha would have spread to the southeastern regions and spread from the Thianshan, Taram and Kuenlan-mountain ranges to the Indus-river mouth
 vayupurana kaa bhugolic varsh-vibhaag praaiah parvatashreneon se vibhakt he
 We have shown above how each year is bounded by mountains or seas
 ham yah bhi dekhte hai ki elbarz-parvatashrenee se oxs-nadi ke tat-praanton tak ek brihat maidan failaa hua he, jiske kisi bhaag-vishesh ko hi ’aryaanaa vrajah’ kahana hoga
 Since the name of meru-parvat has come in the Vayu Purana after the Elvatavarsha, it is said that the terrain from elbarz-parvat to Meru must have been indicative of 'aryan Vrajah'
 oxs kaa pashchimi kinaaraa iraniyon or purvi kinaaraa bhartiya aaryon ke haath main rahaa hua mana ja saktaa he
 The terrain between Albarz and Meru must have been fertile and pleasant at that time and the reason for the struggle of the Aryans would have been the same
 irani shakha ne, sambhavtah zabardast or apekshaakrit ashikshit hone ke kaaran bhartiya shakha ko dakshin-pashchim yani iran kii ore jane se roak diya ho or bhartiya shakha ko parvatiy pradeshon kii sharan lene ko vivash hona padaa ho
 Which mountain is this Meru mountain, it has not yet been said exactly; But when we see that in the Mahabharata, Hattak after Kimpurushvarsha, Mansarovar after Hattak, Gandharva after Mansarovar and Harivarsha after Gandharva i
e
 north-kuru, we have to say that this Hariwar is south of piyanshan-parvat and Pamir The name of the predecessor of the state would have been
 in pradeshon ke aasapaas hi turkistan kii marubhumi he
 It is difficult to say what the desert was at that time; But its condition will be like that at that time, it is doubtful
 sambhavtah yah dasha barf se gali chattaanon ke kaaran hui ho
 In Chinese, 'thian' means heaven and 'shan' means mountain
 ham uttar-kuru ke pradeshon kaa varnan mahabharat main yaa buddha sahitya main swarg kaa-sa pate hai
 We also find a Sanskrit imprint in the name of altai-parvat
 kya yahi thiyaanshaan uttar-kuru-pradeshon kii uttari seemaa ho sakati he ? kya arya log thiyaanshaan or pamir ke madhyavarti maarg se dakshin-purv kii ore nahin bad sakate the ? kya gobi kii marubhumi us samay acchhee dasha main nahin ho sakati thi ? kya maansarovar ke uttarvarti yaa pashchimsth pradesh kii bhoomi kabhi aaryon kii bhoomi nahin thi ? hamaara sahitya to bharat kaa himalayottar-pradesh se sambandh hona batalaata he
 Its memories, where seen, lie in abundance there
 zarurat he unka adhyayan karne or bhartiya itihaas par naveen prakaash daalane kii
 We have to believe Meru Pamir, whether Thiyanshan, in both the situations Harivarsha i
e
 Uttarkuru has to be considered as the answer to Mansarovar
 mahabharat, baudhdhasahitya, puraana yaa ramayana-sabake anusaar yah uttar-kuru--jiske manushyon kaa varnan kuru ke nivaasiyon se yani bhartiya aaryon se kuch vicitra he or jo bhartiya aaryon kii priy bhoomi he, jiskaa kaalpanik samaran bhi aaj prayek arya ko prafullit kiye detaa he, jiske aadhaar par hi swarg kii sari kapana sthit he--bharatvarsh ke uttar he
 The Himalayas are still the main instigators of the creation of the Aryasite
 yah kalpana nahin--puranic-dantakatha nahin--tathy he
 Our notes, our Indra, Varuna and Kubera, Yaksha and Gandharva - all are north of the Himalayas
 meru ke baad harivarsh, naishadh, kimpurush, hemkut or bharatvarsh kii bhoomi aaryon kii leelabhumi rahi he
 There is no poetry, no blank literature, an immovable historical truth
 ham is siddhanth ko tab or bhi drudh pate hai, jab ham somras ke itihaas par drushtipaat karte hai
 All the deities of the Rigveda are matron of Somaras; Somaras are required in all Yajnas of Aryans on foot-steps
 som-stuti par rugveda kaa ek sampoorn mandal hi samarpit he
 It is also named in the Avesta, Haum, but not its glory, which is in the Rigveda of the Aryans
 avesta main somras kaa pinevaala indra mahaz Demon ho jaataa he or yahan indra aaryon ke ekmaatr uddharak ban jate hai
 We have a legend of Sura
 yah sura somras ke sivaa or kuch nahin
 At first both Sur and Asura were Aryans; But those who did not take the protection, those asuras and those who took it were called sur
 ramayana kaa yah shloke isi prakaar kaa he-surapratigrahaddevah sura ityabhivishrutah
 अप्रतिग्रहणात् तस्या दैतेयाश्चासुरास्तथा॥ ham upar diti or aditi kaa zikr kar chuke hai
 These demons were called asuras and were separated from 'aryanam Vrajah', which extends east-north and south from kashyapa-sagar
 astu, hamen yah dekhnaa he ki aaryon ko somras itnaa priy kyon hua ? somras se aavisht ho indra daityon or asuron ko parrast karte hai
 In the Himalayan region, which must have been cold in nature and it is not unnatural to drink Somaras
 somras ke pattharon se pise jane kaa varnan rugveda main bahulata se miltaa he
 Somlata is still found around the Himalayan foothills or Himalayan region - especially Karakoram
 yah som bhartiya aaryon kii apni sampatti he
 The Ahurs have nothing to do with it
 avashya hi sur-dal ko pahari pradeshon main aane ke kaaran kathinaaiyaan jhelni padi hai; parantu som unke praanon kaa aadhaar he
 This substance, this juice reminds itself of the Himalayan region
 yadhyapi is lekh kaa vishay mahenjodaaro or harppa se kuch sambandh nahin rakhata, tathaapi in khojon tathaa inke nirnyon se hamen mahabharat ke samay ke nirnay main bahut sahaayta milti he
 The time of the civilization which has been discovered in Mahenjodaro, has been set 3,200 or 3,300 years before Christ
 aaj se 5,000 varsh purv jab bharat ke pashchimottar-pradesh main ek aisi sabhyataa thi, jisamen loha galaana, eent ke makaan banvaanaa, nahar khudwana, sangemarmar kaa kaam karnaa, kala, shilp-gyaan or shishe kaa prayog prachlit tha, us samay bharat ke anya bhaagon main bhi aisi sabhyataa rahi hogi jo is sabhyataa se laabh uthaa sakati thi yaa ise apane adhikaar main rakh sakati thi
 The greatest importance of the invention of this 1923 AD is that the script was prevalent in India at that time
 isse yorapia panditon kaa yah kahana ki bharatvasi khrishtabd se kuch hi sau varsh pehle likhnaa nahin jaanate the, bilkul asaty or niraadhaar pramanit ho jaataa he
 But one thing, which is very shocking is that this civilization is not of the Aryans but of the non-aryans
 is siddhanth kaa aadhaar yah he ki yahan avishkrut padaarthon main aise chitrafalak or ling tathaa purna evam arddh samadhiyaan hai jo aaryon kii kala se nahin milteen
 These substances are said to indicate the then relationship of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Crete
 hindu-university ke itihaasaadhyaapak shri aar

 in chitrafalkon or lingon ko aaryon ke shivlinga yaa chitrafalkon ke anukaran par bane hone main sandeh karte hai; kyonki in lingon ke saath-saath arya-pranali ke anusaar arghyapatt yaa gauripatt nahin he, atev yah babilonia ke ling kaa anukaran he, na ki shaivon ke shivlinga kaa
 Apart from this, the method of Agnipuja of that time is not similar to the method of Agnipooja of the Aryans
 unhone aanshik samadhi kii tulana--jisamen shav ko log machaan par rakh chhodte or asthi ke avshisht rah jane par use kisi mitti ke bartan main rakhkar gaad dete the--aadhunik chotanagpur ke mundon main prachlit aanshik samadhi se kii he
 The skulls found here are also found in the shape of the Dravidas of Madras
 mahabharat ke viraat parv main pandavon ne apane astron ko, aanshik samadhi ke anukaran par, kapade se chhipaakar rakh choda tha
 This teacher has also written by Mr
 Banerjee
 isse vidit hota he ki pandav logon ke samay main junglee jatiyon main aisa rivaaj rahaa hoga
 It is no surprise that it is not found in Vedic literature
 mahabharat kaa kaal hindu-pranali ke anusaar khrishtabd se 3,000 varsh pehle samajha jaataa he
 This time is found from the time of this legend
 mahabharat ke samay bhi junglee jatiyon kaa hona varnit he
 This cannot impede us from removing the Mahabharata period 5,000 years ago
 sach to yah he ki mohenjodaaro ke anusaar hamen apane itihaas kaa program hi badalanaa padegaa
 We can solve this complex time question by studying the Puranas and epics
 iske naye prakaash main ham itihaas par nayaa prakaash daal sakate hai
 We cannot disbelieve in the time of Mahabharata even when the Mahabharata was written and the body of it changed
 gargasamhita ke ’yugpurana’ par vishwaas kar, jais ki upar batala chuke hai, mahabharat se ajtak arthath 3,000 khri
pus
 se beesvin shatabdi tak ke gauravpurvak drushtipaat kar sakate hai
 God knows, when will we get this chance; But it is gratifying to see that these days whether European and Indian scholars are moving towards the study of Puranas
 astu, vah din bahut dur nahin he jab aaryon kaa purna itihaas hamaare sahitya main mil jaay
 The article has increased a lot, but because it is necessary to say something in the epilogue, it is alright to say that after studying the Rig Veda and Avesta, we can get a true historical introduction of the Himalayan regions after studying mythological and Buddhist literature
 yadi ham bhartiya aaryon ke himalay kii ore se ek baar nahin, samay-samay par kai margon se bharat main aane kii vichaar-drushti se vedon or anya sanskrit-saahitiyon kaa anushilan karen to uski vyakhya atyant saral, subodh or aitihaasik ban jaay
 Hope, Indian history-loving scholar and student should proceed on the said table of Lokmanya Tilak, renovate our history and remove our darkness
 ek baat or, yorapia vidwaanon ne swaarth buddhi se prerit ho jis prakaar hamaare gauravpurn itihaas ko ek tuchh tathaa hey rup dena prarambh kiya tha, usase shaayad chhutkaaraa milane main abhi bahut vilamb he
 To see our history on our eyes, it is also necessary to apply European glasses
 isse badhkar shame kii baat or kya ho sakati he ki aaryon ke ekmaatr pramanik itihaas puraana, buddha-sahitya tathaa anyaanya sahitya par ham avishvaas karen evam bhartiya itihaas kii jaankaree ke liye dar-dar kii khak chaante phiren
 The Puranas are full of geographical knowledge of the Aryans
 inamen varnit sthanon kaa pataa ham tabhi laga sakate hai jab yah purnatah samaj len ki aaryon kii sabhyataa us samay, jab yah bhugol likhaa gaya, un deshon tak fail gayi thi
 It was a tradition of Indian kings to go round and round to defeat the kings in order to achieve the cycle
 arjuna kaa digvijay ke liye himalayottar-pradeshon main janaa mahabharatakaar kii kapol-kalpana nahin, ek akshunn satya he
 The truth is that Indian Aryans - whether they have been primitive inhabitants of India and other Aryans have spread from here to elsewhere in the world, as many scholars believe, even if they come from the North Pole according to Tilak's statement at the end
 Should have reached India - had full knowledge of geography
 us bhugol or itihaas par avishvaas karnaa pracheen arya rishiyon ke prati maha aparaadh karnaa he
 It cannot be said at this time what the Aryan land of the Aryans is
 prayek bhartiya kii yah naiysargik dharna he ki bharat hi aaryon kii sristi-sanathan krida-sthali he
 Whatever is proved to be true, now we have to get out of the trap of European scholars independently and explore our ancient history independently
 hamaare padhane ke liye rakkha gaya aaj kaa itihaas to prahasan yaa upanyaas hi kaha ja saktaa he
 Our ancient Aranyak or mythological literature can tell the history from Aryavarta to Harivarsha
 ishwar kare, ham iske liye katibaddh ho apane sahitya ke avagaahan main lag jaayan
 Does not every Arya-child desire to know the beginning of this civilization, the mother-child, the qutuh-mayi, the pure Arya-saga? arjuna kii vijay-yatra ko satya maanane tathaa puraana main diye hue bhugolic naamon kii aadhunik naamon se tulana karne par yah kahana padataa he ki mahabharat ke samay main arthath aaj se 5,000 varsh purv bhartiya aaryon ko harivarsh tak arthath thiyaanshaan parvat ke asannavartti himalayottar-pradeshon tak kaa purna gyaan tha
 At that time, the Aryans used to call the north-kuru at this time and settled the 'kuru' of Aryavarta to protect the memory of that north-kuru
 madhya-asia ke ’aryaanaa vrajah’ kaa arth aryaavart se miltaa he
 Starting from Korasagar which is in the Arctic Circle, the Aryans came directly to the north by the Puranas specified path, there is no doubt
 ural-nadi or airal-sagar se ’ir’ dhaatu kaa nirvivaad or ghanisht sambandh he
 Airavat is made from 'ir' itself

 In the early fifteenth century, the sons of King John of the western Spanish state of Portugal were growing up and by that time the entire Middle East including Jerusalem was occupied by Muslim rulers
 purv se aane vaale resham, masaalon or aabhushanon par arab or anya muslim vyapaariyon kaa kabja tha - jo manachaahe daamon par ise europe main bechate the
 In the summer of 1412, John's three sons - Edward, Peter, and Henry - thought that they should be entrusted with something more exciting and challenging than the boring work of a prince and a knight
 unhone apane pita se ye kaha
 One of John's servants had just returned from Suuta with money in exchange for Muslim prisoners
 pichley saat sau saalon main islam ke shashan main aane ke baad agar suta ko portugali akraman se parrast kiya jaay to yah nishchit rup se ek chunaiti bharaa kaam hota

 lekin aarthik rup se kuch khaas hasil nahin hua - musalamaanon ne suta ke badale tanjyar se vyapaar karnaa chaalu kiya or suta ke pattan khaali rahe
 Many misconceptions were prevalent in Europe at that time

 But reaching there means defeating the Muslim Arabs and the barbarians present in the Sahara Desert
 henry ke vichaar main ye karnaa sambhav or jaruri tha - akhirakar saat sau saal pehle uttari africa par isaiyon kaa kabja tha
 He requested his father to plan an attack on Tangier, but John did not find it possible

 Ferdinand died in prison

 Information was exchanged and Kovilha headed south to Ethiopia
 vahaan se wo lautnaa chahta tha lekin uske vishwa-gyaan ko dekhakar raja sikandar ne apana salaahkaar niyukt kiya or baad main portugal bhejne kaa vaada kiya
 But he died early and his son did not fulfill his wish
 kowilha vahiin par bas gaya
 a Portuguese mission in 1526 later found that Kovilha was healthy, successful, and healthy in Ethiopia - he married there and died at the age of 74

 Other important names in this fleet of about 170 people were Martim Afonso and Fernao Martins

 Ten to twelve convicts were also placed in this fleet by the king, who were given the task of carrying out information and investigative work at dangerous sites
 pratyaashit rup se jahaaj par koi mahila savaar nahin thi
 a week after the move, on July 15, they reached the Canaries, and then the ship broke apart due to the haze
 kep varde main unki mulaakaat honi tay thi lekin paolo da gamma ko koi or jahaaj vahaan najar nahin aayaa
 However the berries and storage ships came within a few hours
 gamma kaa jahaaj agle chaar dinon tak nahin mila
 After meeting, he stayed there for a week and then left on 3 August
 abhi tak ke sabhi portugali yatraaon main navikon ke jahaaj africa ke tat ke nikach se gujarey the - bartelomayo dias ke bhi
 But a stormy wind, which flows across the open Atlantic, pushes the sailors rapidly to the periphery - which Vasco da Gama listened to
 uske apane navikon ko purv kii ore mud kar africa ke tire chalane kii bajaay khule samudr main dakshin kii ore chalane ko kaha
 After walking in the open sea for several days and seeing no land or hope, on 1 November he came close to the ground

 The accountant on the ship wrote that the skin of the people is brown, they eat the flesh of seals, whales or deer and herbs of the vegetation

 From there he left on 16 November
 bartelemeo dias ke die nakshe se tat rekha bulkul mail nahin kha rahi thi, lekin be chalate rahe or 22 navambar ko uttamasha antareep pahunche
 He had received news of the skirmishes with the local people by Dias there, but there was a clash with them as well
 jahaajon kaa marammat ke baad 7 disambar ko wo vahaan se chale
 On 16 December he reached the mouth of the river from which the sailors of Bertelomeau Dias forced him to return
 unako vahaan dias dwaara sthapit cross dikhaa
 No one had reached the subsequent routes till date - so the pre-made maps became useless and they had to make new maps

 He was also opposed in Mombasa, Kenya

 After keeping the ship off the coast, some sailors visited the city where they met white Christians
 baad main pataa chalaa ki mozambik se khabar milane ke baad vahaan ke sultan ne unhen fansaane ke liye ek yojana taiyaar kar rakhi thi
 Gama escaped from there - but he needed sailors or directors knowledgeable of directions to reach India
 usne ek choti naav par aa rahe chaar logon ko pakad liya
 An old Muslim businessman told that Indian sailors live on the nearby coast of Malindi
 koi chaara na dekh vasco malindi pahunchaa
 He felt that he was a Christian - he was considering the pronunciation of Krishna as Christ
 malindi main, da gamma ne ek bhartiya maardarshak ko kaam par rakhaa, jisane aage ke maarg par portugaliyon kii aguwai kii or unhen 20 may, 1498 ke din kalikat, kerala le aayaa, jo bharat ke dakshin pashchimi tat par sthit he
 The king there invited him to come to the port of Calicut, but there were so many obstacles in the path of Gama that he thought that these too would be enemies
 lekin wo milane ke liye vali se mila or phir sangeet ke saath kalikat main zamorin ne gamma kaa swaagat kiya
 Before coming to the court there, he found a temple where inside he found a statue of a goddess
 purtagaliyon ko laga ki ye mariyam kii murti he or use bharosa ho gaya ki zamorin ek isai shaasha he
 That idol was probably that of Maryamma Devi, whom he thought was Mary's mother Mary
 vruttkaar jo gamma ke saath us dal main shamul tha jinako jamorin ne swaagat kiya tha, likhaa - "is desh ke log bhure hai, chote kad ke or pehle dekhne se irshyaalu or matlabi lagate hai
 Men do not wear anything above the waist

 " fernao martins ne zamorin se mulaakaat main gamma kaa arabi anuwaad kiya
 Muslim advisers in the court caused him many hurdles to talk of business
 unhone gamma ke laae uphaar kii khilli udayi or use raja se milaane main deree kii
 Apart from this, he did not even have a proper gift for the king
 aise kaarnon se use zamorin se ladaai ho gai
 Zamorin's Muslim ministers demanded trade taxes from him
 zamorin ne uske dwaara aagrah kiye gaye stambh ko bhi khadaa karwaane se manaa kar diya
 Reconciliation and then the fight continued
 raja ke muslim mantriyon ne uske dal se kai logon ko agava kar liya
 But the customers on board his ship captured Gama
 ant main use jane kii anumati mili or agast ke ant main wo ravaanaa hua - raja ne usko malayalam main likhaa prashasti patr bhi diya jisamen portugal ke raja jon ke naam sandesh tha ki vosco yahan aayaa tha

 He ordered the remaining ships to return to Lisbon and, after burying the brother, returned to Lisbon with his crew
 vahaan uskaa bhayankar swaagat hua
 Gama came back and narrated his account to King Manuel
 apane purvagrahon ke vipareet use bharat ke isai alag lage or ve portugal ko pahchaan na sake - jisase use achraj hua
 The presence of Muslims in India also caused him a dilemma
 africa main har jagah muslim shashan or arab sagar main muslim vyapaariyon kii taadaad ko dekhakar usko apane "isai kartavya" kii yaad ai or usne do saalon ke andar do or mishan bheje
 The time of January 1500 AD was a very mascot, but there was a delay of 2 months in sending the mission

 His goal was to urge the Zamorin to drive away Muslim traders, besides establishing trade bases in Africa and India
 lekin kai jahaaj uttamasha antareep par pahunchne ke gamma ke bataae dakshin-pashchim or phir purv jane ke choti raste par jane ke kram main kho gaye
 Kabral reached Calicut - The new Jamorin accepted the trade of European ships and assured security
 lekin us saal ke liye arab vyapaaree pattan main pahunch chuke the
 Kebral caught the Arab ship - saying it was a violation of the trade treaty with Jamorin
 iske jawaab main unhone portugali factory ke sabhi 70 logon ko maar diya
 But Kabral's visit was not a complete failure - he approached the kings of Sofala and Kilwa
 wo bharat main kunoor bhi gaya or kuch jahaaj jo 'kho gaye the" - dakshin america pahunch gaye the
 Before the burial could return, Manuel i set out with 4 ships led by Hoao the Nova
 kabral ke chode ek sandesh ko africa ke tat par ek puraane juute main tanga paaya or kalikat pahunchaa
 On reaching there, he attacked many Muslim ships
 kunoor main ek factory lagaar waapas portugal laut gaya
 Thus, the ships of Portugal, for the next 20 years, took hostility from the rulers of Calicut
 san 1502 main vasco ko dubaara bheja gaya
 His next visit was in 1502, when he came to know that the people of Calicut had killed all the Portuguese left behind
 apni yatra ke maarg main padane vaale sabhi bhartiya or arab jahazo ko usne dhwast kar diya or kalikat par niyantran karne ke liye aage bad chalaa or usne bahut si daulat par adhikaar kar liya
 This pleased the king of Portugal very much
 wo cochin, kunnur or goa bhi gaya
 To the south of Cochin he came to know Christians living for centuries
 gamma ne kuch portugaliyon ko vahiin chhod diya or us nagar ke shaasha ne use bhi apana sab kuch vahiin chhod kar chale jane ke liye kaha, par vah vahaan se batch niklaa
 His second visit was very successful for the mission of the Portuguese monarch as he fought fiercely against Arab merchants - forcing the Jamorin into trade and locating Christians living in India
 san 1524 main vah apni antim bharat yatra par niklaa
 At that time, Portugal came to India as the Viceroy of the colony, but he died some time after reaching there

 His long journey against his contemporary Columbus did not even revolt and remained exhausted even after he was exhausted
 vasco da gamma ke bharat pahunchne par arab or moore vyapaariyon ke masaale ke vyapaar ko bahut dhakka laga
 Vasco da Gama not only took a dangerous and hard-earned journey to grab this trade, but also fought many wars

 The poet has not written anything about his subject, but a popular and charismatic person named Shadayappavallar of Tiruvennayanallur village has been mentioned from Kamb Ramayana at multiple places
 vidwaanon kaa anumaan he ki kamban is udaar vyakti ke aashray main kuch din rahe the
 That is why he has remembered Shadappavallar with reverence and gratitude in his poetry

 Not only that, in the Kamb Ramayana, even the shadow of the Srimasutras of the above-mentioned Alwar is visible, even then Kamban has not only made his epic communal, he has also praised the divine in the form of Shiva Vishnu and Ramachandra It is considered an incarnation of God

 The most important thing is that immediately after seeing the symptoms of tonsils, contact the doctor immediately
 doctor dwaara die gaye dawaai ke course ko puraa karnaa chahie
 Often people stop the medicine as soon as they get a little rest, but doing so makes the disease more severe
