 But not only does Sakhi everywhere give a heroic message to the hero, but in a coincidence adornment, the heroine herself delivers the hero
 kahin-kahin nayika, pakshi, megh athwa pawan dwaara bhi nayak ko upalambh bhejti he
 This is often seen in disconnection
 lokkavy main virahinee nayika kaaga aadi pakshiyon ke madhyam se athwa pravasi pati ke nagaradi se aae pathik ke madhyam se upalambh detii he
 The new-born woman seems to be giving a call for the lack of affection of the kindred people of the maiden and the perceived neglect of her sister and brother

 Due to this characteristic of the definition, the Upalambha poetry cannot be considered limited to adornment alone

 Buddhism was founded by Gautama Buddha in the 6th century BCE
 buddha kaa janm 563 isa purv main lumbini, nepal or mahaparinirvana 483 isa purv kushinagar, bharat main hua tha
 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent
 buddha dharm main chaar pramukh sampradaay hai: hinayan, therwaad, mahayan, vajrayan or navyan, parantu buddha dharm ek hi he evam sabhi buddha sampradaay buddha ke siddhanth hi maanate he
 Buddhism is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, nearly 2 billion people in the world are followers of Buddhism

 duniya ke 200 se adhik deshon main buddha anuyaayi hai
 But Buddhism is a 'major religion' religion in a total of 18 countries including China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Mongolia, Tibet, Laos, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and North Korea

 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini

 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed

 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom

 Ralph Waldo Emerson was ordained pastor in Boston in 1826 where he delivered sermons that foreshadowed your future life of essayist
 1832 main aapane is kaary se tyaagptr de diya, kuch to is kaaran ki aap bahusankhyak janata tak apane vichaar pahunchaana chaahate the or kuch isliye ki us giraje main kuch aisi puujavidhiyaan prachlit thim jinhen aap pragativaadee, udaar isiyat ke viruddh samajhate the
 After this, you traveled to Europe with a desire to meet Wordsworth, Collieries and Carlyle and see London
 waapas aakar bahut dinon tak aapane saarvjaanik vaktaa kaa jivan vyateet kiya
 In 1834, you settled in Concord, which has become a place of pilgrimage for literary lovers because of you
 apni pehali pustak "nechar" main aapane thothi isiyat tathaa amareeki bhautikwaad kii kadi aalochana kii

 In 1837, he gave a lecture called "american Scholar" to the "phi-beta-kappa" Society of Harvard University, in which he opposed the trend of imitation in literature and declared the free existence of American literature against the literary slavery of England
 aapane bataaya ki saahitiyik vyakti kaa prashikshan mulat: prakruti ke adhyayan par aadhaarit hona chahie tathaa uske uparaant jeevansangharsh main bhaag lekar anubhav dwaara use paripakv bananaa chahie

 For some time he also edited the progressive magazine "the Dial"

 parantu aapkaa jeevandarshan shrinkhalit nahin he, varan vah aatmanubhoot satyon kaa ek vaiyaktik swapn sa he jise purv ke shreshthatam gyaan ke or bhi drudh kar diya he
 The centerpiece and basis of Emerson's ideas is his coined term "oversole"
 "oversol" vishwavyaapee tathy he or keval "ek" he, yah sara sansar usee "ek" kaa anshmaatr he
 This is what you later termed as "the soul of the pasture", the silent consciousness "and the" cosmic beauty "to which each atomic atom of the world is related equally
 vah vishwatma na keval aatmanirbhar tathaa purna he, apitu swayan hi chakshush krity, drishy tathaa drishyman he
 The analogy of these ideas with the views of the Gita and the Upanishads is clear

 vyaayaam aisi kriya kaa naam he jisase deh main harakat ho, deh kii har ek nas-naadee, ek-ek sell kriya main aa jaye
 At the time when we exercise, the parts of our body try in such a way, in which we get pleasure and also labor
 isse hamaare sharir kaa har ang swasth rahata he
 When we exercise, we move the limbs, our heart and lungs have to work more, due to which each of our breath gets purified, each drop of our blood gets cleansed
 yah hamaare sharir ko lachila banaata he
 Humans working in the brain must do exercise, because the organs of those who earn bread by working from the body still get the opportunity to do the activity, but for people like teachers, doctors, lawyers, computer-operators etc
, exercise is very Necessary
 vyaayaam se deh sundar ho jaati he or uski rogon se ladane kii shakti bad jaati he
 Yes, too much exercise can also cause harm
 aap jab thak jaayen tab aapako vyaayaam karnaa band kar dena chaiye

 sinic ek unani darshan sampradaay, jo samaaj ke prati upeksha tathaa vyaktigat jivan ke prati nishedhaatmak drushti ke liye prasiddh he
 The founder of this sect was Antisthenese
 pehle vah sofist tha
 Later, influenced by Socrates' independent thoughts, altruism and self-denial, he began to consider him his mentor
 yunaan ke janatantr ne sucraat ko jab praan dand de diya, to antistheneez ko vyakti par samaaj kii prabhutaa ke auchity par, phir se vichaar dene ke liye taiyaar na tha ki sucraat ke samaan aatmatyagi vyakti ko prandand de sake
 To fulfill his purpose, he chanted the slogan "walk towards nature"
 us prakritik jivan kii ore sanket kiya, jisamen prayek manushya apane aap kaa swami tha
 Nobody was anybody's slave
 us jivan ko apnaane ke liye, dhan-daulat, sammaan aadi se virakt hone kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Antisthenese gladly accepted it
 kintu, is prakaar ke jivan kaa samarthan karne main vah shiksha, sanskaar, abhivruddhi aadi ke arthon ko lupt nahin hone dena chahta tha
 Therefore, it gave him a moral explanation of the growth of human life
 vah sucraat se prabhavit tha
 Socrates established a causal relationship between knowledge and moral conduct
 is sukaraateey aadarshon ko duhraate hue, antistheneez ne yah dikhaane kaa praytn kiya ki shubhon ke punarmoolyangan main buddhi kii abhivyakti hoti he, aankh muundakar bandhi hui lakiron par chalate rahane main nahin
 The wise person keeps correcting the unsuitable assessment accepted by most of the society from time to time
 apane vichaaron ke samarthan ke vibhinn antistheneez ne saidhantik peethika bhi taiyaar kii thi
 Aflatoon supported the absolute power of the "common" and called the truth of the individual part of the "normal"
 antistheneez ne aflatoon kii is tatvavidya kaa virodh kiya
 He showed that "the common 'has no independent power
" anek vyaktiyon main vyaapt hone se kisi tatv ko "saamaanya' mana jaataa he
 He has no existence apart from individuals
 is prakaar, aflatoon ke saamanyatawad ke viruddh antistheneez ne "namawaad' kii sthapana kii
 He even refuted the "definition dependent on multiplier"
 vah praaia: vastu ko vishisht vastu athwa vyakti maanata tha
 Individuals become the object of decision sentences
 paribhaasha bhi ek prakaar kaa nirnay vaakya he
 However, the general property cannot be a breakdown of a specific object
 is saidhantik peethika par, antistheneez ne vyaktivaadee darshan kaa prarambh kiya jiske anusaar budhimaan vyakti samaaj kaa sadsy nahin, aalochak ho saktaa he
 The credit for furthering Antisthenese's ideas is given to his Shiro Dioginis
 vah kahata tha, "main samaaj kii kuritiyon par bhunkane vaala kutta hoon; meraa kaam prachlit mulyon main uchit maan nirdhaarit karnaa he' inhen donon ke saath sinic sampradaay kaa ant nahin hua
 His tradition continued till the end of Greek philosophy

 In his view, some conscious and impartial reviewers were needed to keep the society on the right path, which should keep revising the accepted values from time to time
 kintu, aise samikshakon ke liye, ve bauddhik vikaas evam naitik aacharan ke saath, nisprihata tathaa samaaj se algaav kii aavashyaktaa ko samajhate the
 In order to do their work properly, Cynic philosophers adopted a special type of living
 ve achche gharon kii, swaadisht bhojan or sukhad vastron kii aavashyaktaa nahin samajhate the
 It is said that Dioginis spent their lives in an old man
 vahi uskaa ghar tha
 Socrates is said to have never worn shoes; Winter, did not change their clothes according to summer
 kintu vah athens nagar main gum-ghumkar, galat kaam karne waalon kii aalochana kiya karata tha
 Being busy in this work, he could never take interest in his ancestral business
 sinicon ne suskuraat ke jivan se shiksha praapt kii thi
 He believed that society can be cautious only by resolving its problems
 sinicon kaa uddeshy samaaj kaa hit karnaa tha; kintu, jis rup main ve apana drushtikon vyakt karte the, usase ve ghor vyaktivaadee tathaa samaaj ke nandak prathit hote the
 Proper subsistence as a sect of Cynic ideals was not possible for long
 antim sinic paristhitiyon ke anusaar jeevanyaapan main sinic aadarshon kii purti maanane lage the
 It was not possible for the successors to be disunited and self-denying as the initial subpoenas
 isiilie, kalantar main sinic kaa saamaanya arth samaaj kii upeksha karne vaala vyakti rah gaya
 But the human element could not cause a complete lack of the Cynic element

 The index of the leading masters who composed commentaries or languages on it, is- mimasaa sampradaay tathaa mimasaa darshan kaa sutara ke rup main sankalan bhagavan jaimini ne kiya he
 There are two things about it
 is vaarthik kii vyakhya main mimasaa darshan kaa itihaas bahut rochak he
 We divide this history into three parts
 jin aacharyo ke naam kaa ullekh jaimini ne apane sutron main kiya he unke granth nahin milte
 In short, the list of their names is - jin pracheen aacharyo ke naam dwadashalakshani main uplabdh hote hai, ve sab ek samay ke the yaa bhinn-bhinn samay ke the or ek sthaan ke the yaa bhinn bhinn sthanon ke, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Whether Jaimini has collected all sides by looking at his texts is also not clear
 dwadashalakshanatmak mimasaa darshan ke karta jaimini muni hai
 There are different views regarding Jaimini
 lekin jaimini sutron main aise sutara he jo panineey vyakaran se siddh nahin hote
 Such as 'dyavosthetti', 'gavasya ch tadadishu' etc
, this is an opportunity to infer that they are ancient from Panini
 is vishay main jo sutara uplabdh hote hai ve jaimini ke hai, yah nishchay he
 But Western Sanskritists are well versed in this subject, Jamini and Badrayan's guruship is famous
 is liye pramanik acharya hone ke kaaran apane-apane granthon main jaimini apane guru baadaraayan kaa naam lete hai or baadaraayan apane shishy kaa naam lete hai
 Panini recites the word Mimamsa in Kramadigan
 isliye unase pracheen ho sakate hai
 The understanding of Jaimini and Mimamsa of Ashwalayan, Shaunak etc
 is clear from their sources
 brihaddevataa main bahut se shloke hai jo jaimini kii yaad dilaate hai, isliye jaimini kaa samay i0 pus0 400 prathit hota he

 upavarsh---inhone mimasaa ke sutron ke upar ek vritti likhi he
 Mimamsa commentator Shabar Swami has instructed him in his commentary from the position of Vrittikar in many places
 shankaracharya bhi devataadhikaran main upavarsh kaa naam lete hai
 'varna and ye words:' Iti Bhagavan Upvarsha:
 bhagawata upvarshen prathame tantre atmastitvabhidhanprasaktau sharirake vakshyam ityuddhar; krit iti'
 This shows that there has been an attitude on the whole of epistemology
 in uddhran ke sivaa inkaa granth nahin miltaa
 Estimates of time may be 300–100 BC
 samarthan There was a poem called Your Kritakoti, which has been cited by Ramanujacharya, the originator of the Vichitadvaita sect, for the authenticity of his commentary
 is vishay kaa nirdesh 'prapanchahruday' naamak granth main hua he
 After them, Mimamsasutravrittikar Lecturers Dev Swami and Bhavdas are known with two such great hearts, but it is difficult to say which book they had
 kumaril bhatta ne apane granth main bhavadaas kaa naam teen chaar baar khandan karne ke liye liya he
 The commentary of Shabar Swami on Mimamsa Sutra is still available today
 isamen choubees hajaar granth hai
 He has commented on the linking scandal, but he does not get it, but such a reference is found in 'sankarshakande Vakshite'

 Scholars like Ramakrishna Bhandarkar and PV Kane etc
 say that you are after Patanjali
 shabar swami ne dashamadhyay ashtum paad ke pehle adhikaran main mahabhashadhikaar ke sambandh main 'sadvaadi panini: asadvaadi katyayan:' kaha he
 If Patanjali was an elder, he would have certainly heard about them, but he did not do so
 isliai patanjali se shabar swami pracheen he
 Not only this; 'athato Dharma Curiosity' In this sutra, Dharmajija Curiosity Dharmajiginasa tells Chaturthi Tattpurush Samas, 'ashwaghoshadinam Anakhyanam' from this Katyayana Mahavartika
 is vaarthik kaa patanjali ne khandan kiya
 In Mimamsa Darshan, in the place of 'athato Dharma Curiosity' etc
, Kumaril Bhatt and in 'athato Brahmajignasa' Shaktaracharya have considered Karmani Shashthi Samas for the favor of the linguist
 isaliye yah mahabhashyakaar se pracheen avashya he
 a comparative study of both Shabar Bhasya and Patanjal Bhashya shows that in Patanjal Bhashya it is evident that Shabar Bhashya has been literally followed
 inako shankaracharya ne 'aagamatatparyvid' is shabd se nirdesh kiya he
 After Shabar Swami, Kumaril Bhatt is ranked in the Mimamsa Darshan
 ye mimasaadarshan main yugpravartak acharya maane jate hai
 The form of epistemology was not clear until the Shabar commentary
 inhone mimasaa ko darshanon mensh sthaan dene kaa sarvapratham prayaas kiya jo atyant stuty he
 These were the first opportunities to confront the Buddhists
 inase khandit buddha darshan kaa baad main or logon ne bhi khandan kiya
 It is characteristic of them that they came to Nalanda from south from Bihar in the form of Buddhist monks to understand Buddhist philosophy as it is
 inhone baurddh darshan kaa yathavat adhyayan kar buddha siddhanton kaa khandan kiya
 This is clear from their talks

 sara jivan inhone isi kaary main lagaaya
 Kumaril Bhatt wrote two commentaries on the term Shabarabhishya, which is mentioned by Madhav Saraswati in 'sarvadarshan Kaumudi'
 ve tikaayen aajkal nahin milti hai
 It comes from the verses etc
 ab jo vaarthik miltaa he vah teen vibhaagon main vibhakt he-shlokavarthik, tantravaarthik or tuptika
 The Shlokavartika is the Taptika of the first foot, the Prathamadhyaya from the second pradhan to the Tantriadhyaya till the Tritiyadhyaya, and the fourth chapter from the Chaturvadhyaya
 ye sambhavat: dakshinatya the
 In this, the words of the Southern language of the Dakshinatyas have been instructed in the proof courtesy authority and in the Picanamadhikaran such as wear, noise, pambu etc
 iske liye or bhi koi pramaan vaarthik main uplabdh hote hai
 Their time is around 620-700E
 mimasaadarshan main sutara ke baad uplabdh granthon main sabase pracheen shabar bhashya he jis par kumaril bhatta kii vaarthik naam se prasiddh vyakhya he
 But Prabhakar Mishra did not like the explanation of Kumaril due to lectures done elsewhere, even after mentioning the commentary
 isaliye veda-vaakyarth-nirnay main us vyaakhyaan ko anupyukt samajhak prabhakar mishra ne shabar bhashya ke upar shabd samarthy evam arth samarthy ko lekar kramash: vivaran evam nibandhan is prakaar do tikaayen kii hai

 In many scholars of India, both were the same person
 lekin, kisi bhi pramanik pracheen strot se in donon mahanubhaavon kaa ekatv pramanit nahin hota

 The 'kashika' interpretation is famous above the Shloka Vratika
 aapane kisi na kisi prasang se prabhakar siddhanton ko laakar unka khandan karnaa apana siddhant banaakar hi kashika likhi
 It was his intention to support the Bhattokta meaning by annotating the lectures of Prabhakar Mishra and the corresponding students
 yah kashika anantashyan sanskrit granthmala main teen bhaagon main prakashit he
 From this, it can be inferred that he would have further lectured the nectar which is unavailable

 |ek chikitsakeey tapamapi]] a thermometer or thermometer is a device used to measure heat or 'heat stress'
 'tapamiti' bhautikee kii us shakha kaa naam he, jisamen tapamaapan kii vidhiyon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Thermometers can be built based on many principles
 dravon kaa aaytan taap grahan kar bad jaataa he tathaa aaytan main hone vaali yah vruddhi tapakram ke samaanupati hota he
 Ordinary thermometers work on this principle
 tapamaapan kii ikai nirdhaarit karne ke liye kisi padaarth ko kramash: do nishchit tapiya samyavasthaon main rakhaa jaataa he
 These are called fixed points
 in avasthaaon main padaarth ke kisi vishesh gun ke pariman nikaal lete hai or unke antar ko ek nishchit sankhya main baraabar baraabar baant dete hai
 Each of these degrees is considered a unit of temperature, which is called a degree or degree
 bahut samay se tapamapiyon main himbindu or bhapavindu kaa niyat binduon ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The temperature at which pure ice and pure air-saturated water coexist at the pressure of one atmosphere is called a snow point
 isi prakaar nishchit daab par shuddh pani or shuddh bhaap kaa samya bhapabindu batalaata he
 In normal thermometers, there is a small hollow hole in the glass, filled with mercury or liquid
 tapiya prasaran ke kaaran drav nalee main chadh jaataa he
 Both the above mentioned points are marked in front of the bottom of the fluid in the tube
 centegrade paimaane main, jisko ab selsius paimaana kehete hai, himbindu ko shunya or bhapabindu ko 100 degree maanate hai
 The distance between these two signs is divided into 100 even parts
 fahrenheit maapehit mapkram main ye donon bindu kramash: 32 or 212 degree maane jate hai or inkaa antar 180 bhaagon main vibhakt hota he
 In the above thermometers, the temperature is based on thermal transmission, but not necessarily so
 koi bhi gun, jo tapavriddhi ke anusaar ekadishtataa se badhata he, is kaary ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 In fact, many sensitized thermometers in the laboratory are based on electronegative changes or thermodynamics
 gunon kii tarah drav padaartho par bhi koi pratibandh nahin hota
 Any substance can be used in a thermometer, but the main problem is that different thermometers can be created by the difference of substances and properties, except for the two fixed points, there will be differences in readings at all other temperatures
 isse siddh he ki yah sab mulat: pramanik nahin maane ja sakate
 In principle, thermodynamics based on thermodynamics are considered automatic proofs and other scales are purified accordingly
 is vigyaan main aise ingine kii kalpana kii gai he jo ek bhatthi se ooshmaa lekar uskaa kuch ansh mahattam dakshata ke saath kaary main parivartit kar detaa he or shesh bhaag ek nimnatapiya sanghnitr ko de detaa he
 This is called the Carno engine, or reversible engine
 siddhant ke anusaar agar bhatthi or sanghnitr ke bahut se bhinn tapiya jode ekatrit hon or ek carno ingine prayek ke bich kramash: lagaaya jaae, to uske dwaara kiya gaya kaary in jodo ke tapatar bhed ke samaanupati hota he
 Thus the temperature can be determined by measuring the work
 is ingine kii dakshata uske silinder main bhare hue dravya or uski avasthaa par nirbhar nahin karti, isliye isko taapmaana kaa aadhaar mana gaya he or iske dwaara nirdhaarit taap ko paramtaap kehete hai
 Like the centigrade and Fahrenheit scales, the permittivity scale is not arbitrarily zero
 carno ingine dwaara kiya gaya kaary bhatthi or sanghnitr donon ke taap par nirbhar karata he
 The thermal state of the condenser can also be such that it converts all the heat from the engine furnace to work and the condenser does not get any part of it
 aisi sthiti main sanghnitr kaa taap paramashunya mana jaataa he
 To determine the degree of degree, two fixed points are required as before
 1954 i0 se purv paramtaap paimaane main bhi him or bhaap binduon kaa prayog hota tha
 The temperature difference of these two was considered to be 100 ° ultimate
 iskaa yah arth he ki kaarne ingine kii bhatthi ko bhapabindu par or sanghnitr ko himbindu par rakhane se jo kaary miltaa he uskaa shatansh kaary ek degree pradarshit karti he
 The major difficulty in this arrangement is that the accuracy of the icepoint is limited and there is a difference of up to ± 01 ° Pa in the zodiacs obtained by different scientists
 isse bachane ke liye san 1954 se antarrashtriya nishchay ke anusaar keval ek hi niyat bindu kaa upyog hone laga he
 Trikindu is the temperature at which water, ice and water vapor are possible
 iskaa maan swechha se 273
16° paa maan liya gaya he
 It can be said that before 1954, the paramount scale was determined by three points, but now only two points are used
 duusaren shabdon main is lekh ke prarambh main varnit do niyat binduon main se ek paramashunya or doosraa trikbindu hota he
 The 1 / 273
16 fraction of the work done by the Carno engine working between Trikbindu and Paramanyu shows an absolute degree of work
 carno kaa ingine adarsh maatr he or vyavhaar main iskaa nirmaan sambhav nahin, parantu yah siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki adarsh gas ke tapiya prasaran dwaara nirmit tapamapi ke paathyank paramtaap ke baraabar hote hai
 Therefore, the ideal gas scale is considered to be an automatic proof, or primary standard
 adarsh gas us gas ko kehete hai jo nimnlikhit niyam kaa paalan karti he: In which there is pressure, volume and temperature
 niyatank he jiskaa maan prayek adarsh gas kii ek gram-anu maatra ke liye ek samaan hota he
 Gas thermometers are of two types, one with constant volume and the other with constant pressure
 pehle kii kriya saral he or uski trutiyon kaa sanshodhan vishwasaneey rup se kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence only static volume thermometers are used
 jaisaa naam ke prakat he, inase gas kaa aaytan sthir rakhkar daab kaa maapan kiya jaataa he
 It takes a lot of hard work and time to extract heat from an ideal gas thermometer
 anek kaarnon se paath main trutiyaan hona sambhav he or inke liye praapt falon main sanshodhan karnaa hota he
 Some errors are corrected by making appropriate changes in the temperature of the thermometer and long calculations have to be done for some
 isse yah siddh he ki gas tapamapi prayogshaala main dainik kaary ke liye upyukt nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, according to international determination, the melting and boiling points of some substances are used as the primary standard
 ye ank adarsh gas-paimaane se bahut parishram ke pashchaat thik rup se maap liye gaye hai or unke maan antarrashtriya sweekruti paa chuke hai

 Heat distortions above 1063 ° are measured by thermometers
 jis prakaar tapavriddhi se padaarthon kii lambaai badhati he usee prakaar dhaatu ke taron ke vidyutpratirodh main bhi taap dwaara vruddhi hoti he
 Like thermal propagation, this increase can also be used in temperature
 is kaary ke liye anek dhaatuon ke taron kaa upyog hota he
 Nevertheless, a thermometer made of platinum wire is more important because it is used for interpolation of international scale
 taar shuddh ghaatu kaa or vikrutimukt hona aavashyak he
 Wrap the wire in a thin mica, or crystal frame, in the bulb and measure its resistance by calculating the heat by the appropriate equation as needed
 pratiroshmapan ke liye kai prakaar ke vidyutsetuon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Among them, the calendar-griffith's bridge is old and well known
 yah wheatstone sethu ke siddhanthapar aadhaarit he
 The carrier wires that are connected to the platinum wire of resistance are also heated by heat, which also changes their resistance
 yah parivartan bhi sethu dvaaramaapit hokar taap kii gananaa main ashuddhi kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 To remove this error from the calendar Griffith bridge, exactly the same type of carrier wire is also placed in the conjugate arm of the bridge
 donon jode tapamapi main paas paas rahete hai or inpar ooshmaa kaa ek sa prabhaav padataa he
 For this reason, they have no effect on the balance and measured resistance of the bridge
 is truti ko dur karne kaa anya upaay yah he ki platinum ke taar kaa pratirodh na nikaal kar uske siron ke bich vibhavantar napate hai
 a certain amount of electric current is carried inside the wire
 iske do siron ko ek vibhavamaapi se jodakar vibhavatanr maap lete hai
 Since the resistance is proportional to the resistance, the resistance is calculated according to the rules of ohms
 inamen vaahak taron ke pratirodh kaa prabhaav purnataya lupt ho jaataa he
 If the wires of two different metals are combined in a circuit and their confluents are placed at different temperatures, then electric current flows in the circuit
 yah dhara paripath main sugrahi dharamapi dwaara dekhi ja sakati he
 The value of the generating force of the current, that is, the electric force, depends on the temperature of a and b
 at: isko naapakar tapantar gyaat kar sakate hai
 The joints of such wire are called heat pair
 antarashtriya paimaane main prayukt tapantar yugmon kii dhaatuon kaa varnan upar kiya gaya he, kintu prayogshaala main sugrahita or prayog kii aavashyaktaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar vibhinn dhaatuen kaam main laai jaati hai
 The temperature in the heat pair is dependent on the temperature, so the temperature at the confluence of the lower temperature is kept constant
 k or kha siron ko vibhavamaapi athwa milivoltmapi se sanyukt karke EMF maap liya jaataa he
 It is directly measured in millivoltmeters, but it is not as sensitive as a voltmeter
 jab kisi thos vastu ko garam kiya jaataa he to usase urja kaa vidyucchumbakeey tarangon ke rup main vikiran hota he
 The wavelength of the waves is low when they are low in temperature and they feel heat
 adhik tapavriddhi hone par chote tarangadairdhyavaali tarangon kaa aadhiky ho jaataa he, jinase prakaash kii pratiti hoti he
 The amount of radiated energy and its properties also depend on the state of the hot object
 purnataya kaali vastu main yah gun hota he ki vah apane upar padanevaali samast vikeern urja kaa shoshan kar leti he or swat: adhiktam urja kaa vikiran karti he
 Such an object is also known as Krishna object or Krishnaka
 yadi chaaron ore se band khokhale pind kii deevaaron ko samtap par rakhaa jaae to uske bheetar utpann vikeern urja gun or maatra main purnataya krishnika vikiran ke samaan hoti he
 Therefore, in the laboratory, we use such a hollow pot for a black body
 yah avashya karte hai ki usamen ek chota chhidr bana dete hai, jisase bheetar se urja baahar aa sake or uske gunon kaa adhyayan sambhav ho
 For the highest temperature use a black body
 isapar aadhaarit tapamapi do prakaar ke hote hai
 The amount of complete radiation is measured in one
 isko purna vikiran uttapamapi kehete hai
 The second type studies the properties of radiation
 inako prakaashiya uttapamapi kehete hai
 These thermometers have the property that they do not require the thermometer to be attached to a hot material and can measure high temperature
 par inamen dosha yah he ki siddhantat: inase keval krishnika kaa tapamaapan sambhav he
 The temperature of other items will be less than the actual temperature, which requires modification
 yah stephen ke niyam par aadhaarit he
 According to this law, the energy radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth degree of absolute heat, that is, ek sthiraank he
 For temperature measurement, the radiation of a thermodynamic object focuses on one end of a heating pair from a lens or mirror, causing energy to be extinguished
 agar sthiraank maaloom ho to uparokt sameekaran dwaara taap kii gananaa ho sakati he
 In fact, the power of heat is slightly different from 4 due to many errors
 isliye vyavhaar main neeche die gaye sameekaran kaa prayog karte hai: It has more constants
 b stephen ke niyamanusaar 4 hona chahie, kintu yahan isko agyaat maan lete hai
 The heat and temperature of a thermodynamic black body is the temperature of the pair
 uttapamapak ko nishchit tapon kii krishnikaon ke samaksh rakhkar a or b kaa maan nikaal liya jaataa he
 There is such a arrangement of radiation focalization in the device that the heat measured from it does not depend on the distance of the heat object
 yadi vastu purnataya krishna na ho to is ashuddhi ke liye sanshodhan kar liya jaataa he
 In these, the microscopic fraction of the spectrum of radiation received from the black body, which has a wavelength of about one, is sorted and its intensity is compared to the radiation intensity of a standard lamp
 yadi tarangadairghy ke liye paramtaap par krishnika kii vikiran tivrata par uski tivrata ho, to plank ke niyamanusaar Is a constant whose value is determined by Planck's theory
 yadi E1, E2 or T1 gyaat hon, to T2 gyaat ho jaataa he
 The invisible fibers change the radiation intensity of the standard light in the atomometer in such a way that its intensity becomes equal to the intensity of the radiated energy measured
 us samay batti kaa tantu adrishy ho jaataa he
 In another type of optical thermometer, the intensity of standard radiation is kept constant and enters the thermometer, including radiation of objects of unknown heat
 daanon ko lambavat talon main rekhadhruvit kar diya jaataa he
 It is arranged that the image of each radiation should be semi-spherical and adjacent to each other
 inako ek nikal prijgs dwaara dekha jaataa he, jisko itnaa ghumaate he ki donon pratibimbon kii prakashtivrata ek si pade
 Find the temperature from the above formula by finding E1 / E2 from the rotating angle of nickel
 antarrashtriya paimaane ke sambandh main 'nimna taap' kaa 1900 sein0 tak maapan varnit he
 This leads to the use of volatile thermometers for lower temperatures
 drav kii vashpadaab uske taap par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, the gases transform into liquid form and fill them in steam volatiles
 daab kii maatra se turant taap gyaat ho jaataa he
 For this, oxygen, nitrogen and helium are used in liquid form
 helium vashpadabeey tapamapiyon se lagbhag 10 tak taap maapit ho saktaa he
 This causes magnetic thermometers to be used for low temperatures
 isamen ek samchumbakeey lavan naapi jaati he or curi ke niyam ke anusaar gananaa karke taap nikaal lete hai
 Normally this temperature has errors, which are amended to remove the temperature
 paare kaa tapamapi sarvavidit he
 Due to its many properties, it is commonly used, but its accuracy is limited
 jahaan vishesh yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vahaan iske vaachan main anek trutiyon ke liye sanshodhan karnaa padataa he
 The most prominent error in these is that the zero symbol varies
 yah do karno se hota he
 When a thermometer is made, its glass keeps shrinking for a long time after that, due to which the zero sign keeps changing
 duusare, jab bhi kisi garam vastu kaa taap napate he, tab shishe ko apni saamaanya avasthaa main aane main bahut samay lagata hai
 The thermometer or thermometer can be classified into two distinct groups according to the level of information on the underlying thermodynamic rules and the physical basis of the quantities
 praathmik tapamapi ke liye, padaarth kii maapit visheshta itani bhalee prakaar gyaat hoti he ki taapmaana ko bina kisi agyaat pariman ke pariklit kiya ja saktaa he
 Examples of this are thermometers that are angular asymmetrical on the equation of a gas state, the velocity of sound in a gas, the thermal noise voltage or the flow of an electric resistor, and the gamma ray emission of some radioactive nuclei in a magnetic field
 Are based on
