 In the 1970's audience, comic comic prodigy Jim Davis created a strip called Norm Nat that received the most negative criticism
 One editor said that "his art is good, his comedies are great" but "no one can recognize these hidden insects
" Davis followed her advice and created a new comic prodigy with Kat as the lead character

 Perhaps the most notable thing was Garfield's uncovering; As he passed through "davis' development" in which he walked on his hind legs, "became thin-skinned" and looked up and stopped with his small blind-blind eyes
 davis ke anusaar uskaa vikaas is baat ko aasaan banane ke liye tha ki "odi ko teble se bahaar dhakel diya jaye" athwa "pai ke ek tukade tak pahunchaa jaye"

" First appearance: 19 June 1978 Jon: Here's my sixth-grade report card
 My parents were so proud
garfield, reading the report card: "jon has not shoved any crayons up his nose this term
" John Garfield's boss, usually portrayed as a weird slut, will grow, disorganized, who has trouble getting a date
 jon kaa liz par ek krash bhi tha, or ab vah uske saath dating kar rahaa he
 John loves Garfield and all cats
 Many comedies throw particular light on this; Her inability to date is often combined with her lack of social acumen, her keen interest in dress, and her eccentric interests that range from measuring the length of her toes to growing fingernails, starting with the stamp collection
 "polka Films with "ninjas" extends to the viewing
 duusare strips use vichkshan buddhi main kami ke rup main chitrit karte he 
 jon kaa janm ek farm main hua tha, jisamen jaahir taur kam suvidhaayen thim; ek strip main, uske pita, ghar ke andar pipe par use dekhakar kehete hai, "vaav ! ! vigyaan kya kuch bhi nahin he? jon kabhi-kabhaar apane mata-pita, bhai or daadi ammaa se milane unke farm main chalaa jaaya karata he

 uskaa pehla maalik jon kaa dost leman tha, yadhyapi jon ne use baad main strip ke lekhan se leman ko nikaal baahar kar die jane ke baad jon ne apana liya tha
 Odie is usually gleeful, affectionate, and blissfully unaware of Garfield's eccentric, tormenting nature, while Garfield hurts him physically, as in the strip's serialized portrayal of Garfield pushing Odie
 Or to trick him out of the coffee table
 kuch maukon par, haalanki, use kaaphi samajhadaar darshaya gaya he, jaisaa ki ek strip main, vah ek baari pathar pakade rahata he taaki vah garfield ko aisa karne se roke rakhe or vastav main vah garfield ke pairon ko chot pahunchataa he

 ek or strip main, use dekha jaataa he ki vah jon ke sudoku paheli ko sulajhane main laga hua he
 Template: Issue Stripes show Garfield commenting on the mystery of Odi's mess with the shape of his tongue, "is it any wonder that there is no room for brains in his head?" And in another one in which Garfield pulls Odie's tail, resulting in Odi's tongue pulling out
 saanchaa:issue Many comic satirics are particularly focused on Garfield's obesity and his overeating; His hatred for Mondays, any work related to dieting and hard work and fatigue, and his mistreatment of Odie and John, as well as his correspondence with Nermal in Abu Dhabi
 Although he can eat almost anything, Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna, he also enjoys eating John's domestic plants and other pets

 Other comedies focus specifically on John's social weakness and inability to get a date; Before he starts dating Lees, he has often tried to get a date, usually without any success when he gets a date, everything gets messed up and upside down, John's Date is already weary and exhausted, he is pacified with sedative medicine and the police is called when he hangs a carrot in his ears
 garfield kii duniya kuch khaas jagahon main simati he jo saamaanya rup se comic strips main dikhaai dete hai jaise kii wet kaa karyaalay, ek ansi jagah jise vah nafrat karata he

 On the farm, John's mother cooks a lot of dinner, for which Garfield embraces him
 jon kii ek dadima he jo, ek stip main, odi ko laat markar nikaal detii he; baad main garfield use gale laga letaa he
 John's parents once went to visit John, Garfield and Odie in the city
 jon ke pita apana tractor chalaakar shahar gaye or use jagaane ke liye ek murga laayaa
 As Garfield loves food, he often goes out to eat at restaurants
 adhikansh yatraaon kaa ant sharmnaak hota he kyonki garfield bahut zyada kha legaa, yaa jon bevakoofi se bhari kuch harakatein karegaa, jisame ek badsoorat shart pahan lenaa shaamil he, jab ek raat vah liz ko ek taarikh par le jaataa he
 When John takes Liz on a date, Garfield always sticks together and once he is full on bread
 aksar, charitra chauthi diwaar, pathakon ko kuch samajhane ke liye todate hai, aise vishay ke bare main baat karte he jo aksar strip ke masakharepan ke pravaah ko barkaraar banaae rakhe, yaa ek maatr chamak dene ke liye aisa kare jab ek charitra kaa mahatv ghat gaya ho yaa prabhavit nahin karata ho
 Occasionally, this episode revolves around the traditions of the strips;, for example, in one strip, Garfield finds a cold and complains about it, noting that "eben my thoughts taunts
" Taxes have been paid
 " Garfield often talks with a small character for two or two weeks, in an event, or such thing as a normal, earlne, postman, alarm clocks, conversation scale, TV, poke, spiders, mice, thread balls, diet Is busy in dieting, penthouse, pie, throwing, fishing, holidays, etc
 duusare anuthe prakaran hai jaise "garfields bilive it or note,” “garfields laa" "garfields history of dogs," evam "garfields history of kats" jo yah dikhaata he ki vigyaan, itihaas or duniya ke bare main garfield kaa najariya kya he
 Another special episode is "national Fat Week", where Garfield spends an entire week making fun of thin-skinned people
 ek or prakaran bhi he, jisame garfield kaa odi ko pakadana or uskaa bhojan kha lenaa tathaa "odi ko agle saptaah shaamil kiya gaya he
 Soon, Garfield realizes that "that thing is not there at lunch without an OD
 He always slips behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my own food
" a week after the start, Garfield is lying in his bed "with an irritating feeling that i am forgetting something," in the next panel, Odie rides to Garfield

 Two particular examples are Lillian, a cynical rascal strange middle-aged woman with her peculiar antics, and Greta, a muscular ravishing woman hired to care for pets during the New Years
 disambar kaa adhikansh samay christmas kii taiyaari main biit jaataa he, jisame ek ummid ke mutabik uphaaron par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Another example is "splat Week", when Garfield tries to avoid the pies thrown at him
 garfield ke itihaas ke adhikansh bhaag main, ek pai ke saath maare jane ke falswaroop anivaary rup se dhwani-anukaran 'splat' main badal gaya he, isliye yah naam padaa
 Every week before June 19, Strype focuses on Garfield's birthday, the day his fears continue to haunt him as he grows older
 aisa uske chhathwein janmdin ke baad se shuru hua he
 Nevertheless, before her 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a snack
 19 june 2007 ke din, garfield ko janmdin kaa sabase bada tohfa diya gaya tha: "alpaahar se mujhe chhutkaaraa mil gaya!" kabhi kabhi strip daraavna theme par aadhaarit chutkule jiseki hasya mukhute ke saath hi saath helovin manaati he
 It also has seasonal jokes, snow-related satire in the months of January or February and summer jokes on the beach or summer theme

 In Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary collection in which the strips have been reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the origins of this series of strips
 unka sheershak:apni sampoornataa main rajya During a writing session for Halloween, i got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips
 i wanted to scare people
 And what do people fear most? Why, being alone
 We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers
 Reaction ranged from 'right on!' to 'this isn't a trend, is it?' ek aavarti kathanak main garfield kaa kho janaa yaa bhaag janaa shaamil he
 The longest of these lasted for more than a month, beginning with John asking Garfield to bring the newspaper
 garfield ise laane ke liye baahar chalaa jaataa he, lekin vah anumaan lagaataa he ki agar vah bhatakta rahe to kya hoga - or pataa lagane ke liye faisla karata he
 John sees that Garfield has gone too far, so he sends Odie out to find him
 use jald hi apni galati kaa ehsaas ho jaataa he 
 jon akelaa hi ravaanaa ho jaataa he, isliye vah garfield or odi kii vaapasi ke liye ek puraskaar pradaan karne kii ghoshnaa karata he
 He is not descriptive, a turtle and therefore brings animals including an elephant, monkey, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and Joey, to John's house for the reward

 Another story involves John going away on a business trip around Christmas, arranging for Garfield a week's worth of food that he instantly loses, so Garfield leaves his house and is locked out

 The number of villages in Talluka could have been more than eighty-four but could not be less than eighty-four

 " san 1896 main zemaan ne sodium jwaala ko ek prabal vidyutchumbak ke do dhruvon ke madhya rakh kar uske prakaash kii jaanch kii or yah khoj nikaala ki varnakram kii donon teevr pili rekhaayen kuch chaudee ho gayi
 If the resolution of the spectroscope is too high, then each spectral line of a light source placed in a magnetic field is divided into several component lines
 is ghatana ko zemaan prabhaav kehete hai
 In 1892, Faraday tried unsuccessfully to see the same effect
 avasorak madhyam ko chumbakeey kshetra main rakhane par avashoshit rekhaon kaa ghatakon main vibhaajan hota he
 This is called the inverse Zeeman effect
 zemaan prabhaav dekhne ke liye varnakram rekhaon ko ek ucch vibhedak kshamtawale upkaran, jaise lumor-geharke patt or niyam vichlan varnakramalekhi ke yoga dwaara nirikshan kiya jaataa he
 An inspection of the magnetic field in the vertical direction gives a longitudinal view from the transverse view and inspection in the parallel direction
 anudairdhyadrishy ke liye chumbak ke ek dhruv ke madhya main chumbakeey kshetra ke samaantar ek naalee yaa surang kaa hona aavashyak he
 The Lorents interpreted it on the basis of their electron and radiation theory and predicted that these spectral lines should be polarized by the magnetic field
 anudairdhyadrishy main in rekhaon main vrittiya dhruvan or anuprasthadrishy main raikhik dhruvan hona chahie
 These predictions were verified by Zeman
 lorents ne apane siddhant dwaara yah dikhaaya ki prakaash kii varnakram rekha ko chumbakeey kshetra kii lambdisha main dekhne par teen ghatak rekhaayen drushtigochar honi chahie In the Zeman effect when only three component lines are seen at the above displacement, it is called Prakrit Zeman effect and the sample of those component lines is called Prakrit Trika or Lorents Trika
 parantu jab ek varnakram rekha kai adhik ghatak rekhaon main vibhajit ho jaati he, tab use aprakrut zemaan prabhaav kehete hai, kyonki uski vyakhya chir pratishthit siddhant ke aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati
 The Prakrit Zeman triad is special form and is represented by the spectral lines of the unit range, while the Lande coefficient of the initial and final energy state is equal to one
 saadhaaran lorents trik jasta or cadmium ke varnakramon main dekhe gaye tathaa unke aavritivisthaapan qdh or kt kii maap se e / m kaa pariman uparyukt sutara dwaara nikaala gaya, jo runagra kirnon dwaara nikaale hue e / m ke baraabar paaya gaya
 This result is the observed direction of rotation of circular polarity in unity and longitudinal view, evidence that radiation in the atomic spectrum emits by moving negative electric charge
 preston ne adhik vikshepan or vibhedan-kshamta vaale upkarnon ke prayog dwaara yah sthapit kiya ki usee varnakram rekhaon kii kisi vishisht shrenee kaa zemin-ghatak-rekhaon kaa namoona ek hi prakaar kaa hota he or us shrenee kaa lakshan hota he
 Thus the Zeman effect became the typical means of spectral analysis
 san 1907 main ruunge ne yah dikhaaya ki aprakrut zemaan namoonon kii ghatak rekhaon kaa visthaapan, prakrut trik rekhaon ke visthaapan gunanfal ke rup main prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the p and s components will have displacement and Lorent units
 ke liye yah visthaapan lorents ikaiyaan hoga
 The Zeeman effect is seen only when the external magnet field is weaker than the internal field generated by the electron's ground and orbit motions; But when the external field is stronger than these internal regions, then the Zeeman effect becomes the western-back effect
 yah prabhaav san 1912 main pashchan or back ne dekha or yah paaya ki bahut adhik teevr chumbak kshetra main prakrut zemaan ghatak namoona prakrut zemaan ghatak namoona prakrut zemaan trik main badal jaataa he
 That is why the zeman effect is the main tool for spectral analysis and to detect the electron formation of atoms and ions

 Some people say that the people of the Taj Mahal were asked to write an agreement that they would not build any other building of this nature
 aise hi daawey kai prasiddh imaaraton ke bare main bhi kiye jate rahe hai
 There is also no evidence of the fact that Lord William Bentick, the Governor General of India, planned to auction the Taj Mahal in the 1830s by demolishing it

 Ramjiavan Das Bavla was born on 01 June 1922, in Chandauli district, then in a very common ironcar family of Bhishmatpur village in Chakia tehsil of Varanasi
 pita ramdev vishwashkarma jaateey vyavsaay se jude the
 Mata Sudeshwari Devi handled the household work
 ramdev ke chaar putron or do putriyon main bawalaa ji sabase bade the
 There was no tradition of education in the family, yet Bavla ji was enrolled in the primary school in the village
 inhone darja teen to paas kar liya, magar chaar main fail ho gaye
 Names were re-written in class four
 nakal ke sahare inhone darja chaar to paas kar liya, magar iske baad padhai-likhaai ko sadaa ke liye alavida karte hue kaha ki santan ko kahaan sikri so kaam
 From the time of primary education, he was inclined towards poetry and music
 kehete hai ki sohabat kaa asar vyakti par padataa he
 Bavla ji's elder father Ramaswamrup Vishwakarma was a penetrator of music and Ramayana
 bawalaa ji ne pushtainni peshey ko bhi badi aasaani se apanaaya
 He himself says, "we will take Bansula and walk with Babu ji, and Randa is also very dead

 i am a resident of Babua, my friend is a woman, a ratiya spent in crazy society
 kand, mul, fal, jal seva main jutaibe,babua bolta naa
 Sewa karibai means our biswas, babua speak na 
 ' yaheen se ram par aadhaarit geeton kii rachana shuru hui
 There is also an interesting anecdote behind the nickname Bavla
 shuru main unhone kuch bhajanon kii rachana kii thi, jiske prakaashan ke liye ve gaanv ke hi ek mitra ke saath varanasi aae
 The name Ramjiyaavan of the six varnas did not sit at all

 He remained in mental turmoil overnight

 Bumped into a person there usne jhalla kar ramjiyavan ko kuch kaha
 In his murmur, he heard the word mad
 turant hi bawalaa upnaam apana liya
 For the first time, Ramjiyaavan Bavla got the opportunity to recite poetry in Varanasi in 1957-58 as a poet
 vahiin par akashwani ke hariraam dvivedi ne inke naam ke saath das shabd jod diya, tab se yah ramjiyavan das bawalaa ho gaye
 At the same time, he was awarded the Bhojpuri Gaurav Samman
 bawalaa ji kii rachanaaon main gramin samaaj va kisaan jivan kaa atyant jeevant chithran miltaa he
 He has painstakingly depicted the problems faced by the village, society as a matter of law, and Sursa

 khet main kinai, sadhwai samaan ba,sapana ke sodh main udhaar ba nanga
 
 samaaj ke andar utpasannas buraaiyon kaa chithran karte hue kehete hai-hai re samaaj, aaj laaj ba na lehaaj ba,chor, ghuskhor kul ban jaalan baankaa
 Explosion in the court of injustice, robbery bomb blast in Dahri

 bawalaa ji shiv upaask hai
 Hence, your initial works are devotional

 Some geographers divide the indo-gangetic Plain into several parts: the Indus Valley, the plains of Punjab, the plains of Haryana, and the middle and lowlands of the Ganges
 These regional differences are mainly based on the availability of water
 ek anya paribhaasha ke anusaar, sindhu-ganga ke maidan dilli rij dwaara do ghaatiyon main vibhajit hai; pashchimi bhaag main punjab or haryana ke maidani ilaake sthit hai or purvi bhaag ganga-brahmaputra kii jal nikasi pranaaliyon se bana he
 This division is only 300 meters above the sea surface, due to which there is a belief that the indus-gangetic plains seem to be continuous between the two valleys
 punjab evam haryana ke maidani ilaakon kii sinchai raavi, beas or sutluj nadiyon dwaara kii jaati he
 Due to the progress made in irrigation projects on these rivers, the flow of water has reduced, which reaches the lower valley areas of the Indian state of Punjab and the Indus Valley in Pakistan

 The major rivers of this region are Ganga and Indus and their tributaries - Vyas, Yamuna, Gomti, Ravi, Chambal, Sutlej and Chenab

 a large number of vegetarian animals were found in the open fields, including three species of rhinoceros

 Many species of wild boar, deer and sambhar were found in the forest areas
 ganga ke kareeb daldali kshetron main dariyaan ghodon kii vilupt prajatiyon ke saath bhainson ke vishaal samooh charate hue nazar aate the
 Therefore, such a large number of animals must have attracted a large number of carnivorous animals as well
 Wolves, jackals, striped laggards, Indian cheetahs and Asiatic lions may have hunted heavily on the open plains while tigers and leopards may have hunted in the surrounding forests
 The Ganges was home to a large number of gharial, crocodiles and dolphins found in the river, which controlled the number of fishes and occasional herds crossing the river

 Various kingdoms rose and expanded in the flat and fertile region, including the Gupta Empire, Kannauj, Magadha, Mauryan Empire, Mughal Empire and Delhi Sultanate - the demographic and political centers of all these kingdoms were located in the indus-gangetic plains
 bhartiya itihaas ke vaidic or mahakavy yug ke dauraan, is kshetra ko "aryaavart" kaha jaataa tha jo pashchim main sindhu nadi tak tathaa dakshin main vindhya parvat shrinkhalaaon tak failaa hua tha
