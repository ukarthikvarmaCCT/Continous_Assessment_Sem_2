 When the baby Hanuman was hungry, he considered the rising sun as a fruit and started flying in the sky to catch it
 unki sahaayta ke liye pawan bhi bahut teji se chalaa
 On the other hand, Lord Surya did not allow him to burn with his glory, considering him as an innocent child
 jis samay hanuman surya ko pakadaney ke liye lapke, usee samay rahu surya par grahan lagaana chahta tha
 When Hanumanji touched Rahu in the upper part of the Sun, he was afraid and ran away
 usne indra ke paas jaakar shikaayat kii "devraj! aapane mujhe apni kshudha shant karne ke saadhan ke rup main surya or chandra diye the
 Today, on Amavasya day, when i went to suffer the sun, i saw that another Rahu is going to catch the sun
 " After listening to Rahu, Indra panicked and took her along and walked towards the sun
 rahu ko dekhakar hanumanji surya ko chhod rahu par jhapate
 When Rahu called Indra for protection, he hit Hanumanji with Vajrayudh, causing him to fall on a mountain and his chin was broken
 hanuman kii yah dasha dekhakar vayudev ko krodh aayaa
 He stopped his pace at that moment

 went to the shelter of Brahma
 brahma un sabko lekar vayudev ke paas gayi
 He was sitting sad with a tangled Hanuman in his lap
 jab brahmaji ne unhen jivit kiya to vayudev ne apni gati kaa sanchaar karke sabhi praaniyon kii pidaa dur kii
 Then Brahma said that no weapon can damage its part
 indra ne kaha ki iskaa sharir vajra se bhi kathor hoga
 Suryadev said that he would give him a century of his glory and also blessed him to be penetrating the scriptures
 varun ne kaha mere pash or jal se yah balak sadaa surakshit rahegaa
 Yamdev blessed to be avidya and neerog
 yaksharaj kuber, vishwakarma aadi devon ne bhi amogh vardaan diye
 Lord Hanuman's chin was broken by Indra's thunderbolt

 The diameter of Akash Ganga is about one lakh light years

 According to scientists, the universe originated from the explosion of a superpower

 Every star in this universe is like the Sun

 a light year is the distance that the distance light travels in a year at a speed of one lakh twenty six thousand thousand miles per second

 Thus, the distance of the Sun from Earth was a quarter to eight light minutes
 jin taron se prakaash aath hajaar varshon main aata he, unki duuri hamane paune santalis padam mile aanki he
 But the stars are so far away that it takes millions, crores, billions of years for light to come from them

 Thus Hubble's observations revealed that the sky Ganges is going away from us
 habal ne yah bhi bataaya ki unki prithvi se dur hatane kii gati, prithvi se unki duuri ke anupaat main he
 Astronomers have observed the extinction of the galaxy from the telescope of a 200-inch diameter lens located at Mount Polomer Observatory

 If observers are sent to other sky Ganges, they will also find that they are the focal point of this universe, the rest of the sky Ganges are running away from us

 According to Newton, the transpiration force between the two bodies has an immediate effect on each other, but Einstein proved that the speed of reciprocal transpiration power cannot be as fast as the speed of light
 aakhir yahan par ainstin ne newton ke patr ko galat pramanit kiya
 People liked Einstein's theory

 According to this belief, the universe has originated from the explosion of a Mahapind and that is why the Ganges of the sky is running away from us

 Therefore, it means to say that at some time there must have been a Mahapind and due to its explosion, the Akash Ganges are running away from us

 Differential geometry is a mode of mathematics that studies geometric problems using calculus and linear and multi-line algebra
 isamen un talon or bahugunon ke gunon k adhyayan kiya jaataa he jo apane kisi alpaansh ke sameep sthit hon jaise kisi vakr athwa tal ke gunon kaa adhyayan, uske kisi bindu ke pados main
 Measured differential geometry is concerned with properties that have measurement functions
 shastreey avakal jyamiti main aise vakron or talon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jo trivimiya eucalidia avkaash main sthit hon
 It uses methods of differential calculus and integration; Or say that in this study, we study the properties of curves and planks, which are fixed even in three-dimensional motions
 viksheptmak avakal jyamiti main ham kisi jyamitiya akruti ke kisi sarvik alpaansh ke sameep uske un gunon kaa adhyayan karte hai jinamein kisi sarvik viksheptmak roopaantar se koi vikaar nahin hota
 For example, the properties of a curve whether or not a tangent or an inclination plane exists at some point are deflective aberrant properties, but the property of a plane whether or not an alphanumary is present is not deflective, because it has a sense of length
 Contained which is not deflective
 akritiyon ke viksheptmak avakal gunon ke adhyayan kii kam se kam teen vidhiyaan nikal chuki hai jo is prakaar hai: Differential equation, ghaati-shrenee-prasar or Dispersion of deflection coordinates of a point into positions of a parameter or differential forms
 pehali or teesri vidhiyon main pradeesh kalan kaa prayog kiy ja saktaa he
 By choosing the appropriate instruction triangle, the mode of choice will be unique, the equation of a plane curve can be molded as: is ghaat shrenee ke samast gunank sarvik vikshep roopaantar ke antargat, vakr ke param nishchal hai, at: ve mulbindu par vakr ke samast viksheptmak avakal gunon ko vyakt karte hai
 The sense of tangent at a point in a curve is well known
 maan lijie ki ham kisi vakr ke bindu paa ke sameep chaar anya bindu lete he
 When these four points move towards Pa, then the boundary of the conic drawn by these five points will be the point conic at the point Pa of the curve
 isi prakaar ek samtal trighaati ke is gun kii sahaayta se ki uskaa nirdhaaran nau swechha binduon se hota he, ham aashleshan trighaati kii paribhaasha de sakate hai
 In this study, due to the use of limit, calculus comes in very handy
 saadharantaya trivistari viksheptmak avkaash main ananthasparshi vakro ke do ekprachal parivaar hote hai
 If there are less than two families, then the floor will be viable
 yadi do se adhik hon to tal ek samtal hoga
 If the planets and planets are excluded and the asymptotic lines are assumed to be the oriental curves of the plane, then the quadratic coordinates can be chosen such that they satisfy the following code of differential equations: inhen fyabin ke avakal sameekaran kehete hai
 Multiplications are fixed on the upper floor
 kisi tal ke viksheptmak gunon main se ek gun hota he uskaa kisi anya tal se sparshakram 
 In particular, there is a triprachal family of quadratic planets whose bottom touches a second-order point on a point from the surface
 yadi dwighati is prakaar chune jaaen ki mu par, pratichchhed vakr ke sparshi, mu ke ananthaspashiyon ke prati abhidhruvi ho to dwighatiyon ko darbo dwighati 3-bindu spershiyon ko darbo sparshi kehete hai
 At each point of the page there is a monogamous family of Darbo quadratic
 isamen se bahut vishesh prakaar ke dwighati hote hai
 Probably the most interesting are the quadratic
 inkaa vivaran is prakaar diya ja saktaa he: mu ke ananthasparshi vakr va par do samipsth bindu paa or paa2 lekar teenon binduon par ananthasparshi vakr ke sparshi khincho
 These three tangents determine a quadratic
 jab paa or paa2 vakr va ke anudish mu kii ore agrasar hote hai, tab ukt dwighati kii seemaasthiti ko lee dwighati kehete hai
 a bicameral family of lines is called congruency
 udhaahrant: kisi tal ke mapatmak abhilamb ek sarvangasamata banaate hai
 If the association of a point mu on a page is from a line whose position varies with the mu, a congruence of such lines is formed
 jab mu tal pri ke kisi upyukt vakr par chalata he tab sarvangasamata kii sahchar rekha vakr ko sparsh karti he or is prakaar ek vikasya tal kaa srijan karti he
 Generally on a plane, there are two unicameral families of such curves
 sarvangasamata ke vikasya talon se inaki sangati baithti he
 Now suppose that a congruent congruence is formed by the lines going from the middle of the points on the plane of the surface that are not located on the tangents of the surface drawn at those points, then the inverse poles of these lines against any Darbo quadratic are of a congruency
 Form lines whose lines lie on the tangents of the surface, but do not pass through their tangents
 sarvangasmtaon ke aise jodon ko vyutkram sarvangasmtayein kehete hai
 To date, many pairs of inverse congruences have been studied
 inhen main se ek yugma wilziski kii niyat sarvangasmtaon kaa he
 These can be defined as: If the two divisors of the curves corresponding to the evolution of a pair of inverse congruent congruences of the integral become integral, the above congruent congruences are termed as Wilginsky's fixed congruences
 yah jaanane ke liye ki vikshep jyamiti main sarvagamataon kaa kya mahatv he, sanyugmi jaalon kii kalpana ko bhi samaj lenaa aavashyak he
 We can define them as follows: maan lijie, kisi tal pri ke kisi bindu ke madhya se ananthasparshi vakr khinche gaye hai, to is bindu kaa sparshi or ukt vakron par us bindu par khinche gaye spershiyon ke prati uskaa haraatmak sanyugmi, ye donon milakar sanyugmi sparshi kehalaate hai
 If one of the pairs of conjugate tangents is assumed to be tangent to one of the curves of a common curvilinear, then the second tangent of the pair will be tangent to another monochromatic curvilinear
 vakron ke aise do kulkon se sanyugmi jaal kaa nirmaan hota he
 Another characteristic feature of conjugate webs can be expressed in these words: When a point mue moves on a curve of the conjugate mesh, the tangent drawn to the point moo on another curve of the mesh creates a developmental plane
 jab ek bindu tal t ke kisi vakr par chalata he, to uskaa mapatmak abhilamb ek rujurekhaj tal kaa srijan karata he
 If the curvature is taken in place of the curve, then it becomes the vertical surface
 vakratarekhaon dwaara nirmit jaal ek sanyugmi jaal hota he or mapatmak abhilamb sarvangasamata se uski sangati baithti he
 We express this in such a way that the scale of the congruent is congruent with the congruent plane
 viksheptmak avakal jyamiti main bahut si sarvangasmtayein aisi hai jo sarvikrut abhilamb sarvangasmtayein kahala sakati hai, kyonki sarvagasamata kaa nirdhaaran tal se hota he or vah tal se sanyugmi rahati he
 One of these is the so-called green-fubini deflection feature as well
 vah vakr jiske sparshi ek vikasya tal kaa nirmaan karte hai, tal kii nishit kor kehalaata he
 The characteristic feature of the conjugate tangents of Moo leads to the conclusion that each of the pairs is tangent to the core marked at the tangent point
 is prakaar jo do rashmibindu praapt hote hai ve mu ke jaal kii ek rashmi kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 The intersection line of the measurement planes at the point m of the curve of the mesh is the axis of the mesh
 rashmi tathaa aksh or unke dwaara janit sarvagasamataon kaa adhyayan bahut se vyaktiyon ne kiya he
 Some people have tried to use the imagery of epigraphies, seeing how much they are important in the scale differential geometry, in deflection geometry
 pratham to nishchal anukal ke bahmajon ko vikshep alpaantari kehete hai
 All the deflections of the diagonals form a cone of level 3
 ukt shanku kaa nishit aksh green or fubini kaa vikshep abhilamb hota he
 Another universalization of minorities is found in the coincidence curve of congruency
 ukt vakr tal pri kaa ek aisa vakr hota he, jiske prayek bindu kaa aashleshan samtal us bindu kii sarvagasamata rekha ke madhya se jaataa he
 Arrangement of a written information or document in a particular order is called concordance
 udhaaharan ke liye, There are several methods of encapsulation
 latin lipi par aadhaarit bhashaaon ke aankadon kaa samaanukraman alphabet ke kram par aadhaarit hota he kintu devanagari tathaa anya bhartiya bhashaaon main samaanukraman karne ke liye keval varnakram paryaapt nahin he
 These include comparing two words or phrases with 'consonant + quantity' as a unit
 aajkal samaanukraman karne ke liye sanganak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are different methods and methods for encoding according to language and script
 latin lipi par aadhaarit bhashaaon kaa samaanukraman varnakram par aadhaarit hota he jabaki brahmi lipi par aadhaarit lipiyon vaali bhashaaon main samaanukraman kuch jatil he
 There is also a different method for encoding for the Chinese language

 The capital of these was the city of Baghdad, Iraq
 mukhya nyaayadhish swargavaasi hone ke kaaran vah pad khaali hua, use bharti karne ke liye, khaliph ne abu hanipha ko is pad ke liye peshkash kii, laqin abu hanipha swatantra rahanaa pasand karte the, is liye is prastaav or peshkash ko thukraa diya
 This term is called "qadi-ul-quzat" in Arabic language
 is pad par unke chaatr abu yusuf niyukt kiya gaya
 The Caliph al-mansur and the Digar people did not like the fact that Abu Hanifa denied this position
 chuun ki, abu hanipha is qaabil the, or unhen qaabil samajha gaya, isi liye unhen peshkash kii gayi, jis ko abu hanipha ne khud ko qaabil na bataate huve thukraa diya
 The Khalifa said that you are lying
 tab abu hanipha ne kaha ki agar vah jhooth bol rahe hai to aise jhuthe ko aise oonche pad kii pesh kash nahin karnaa chaiye
 On this matter, the angry Khalifa arrested Abu Hanifa and got him locked up in prison
 kuch maheenon baad abu hanipha jail hi main mar gayi
 Shah Ismail's Safavid Empire In 1508 AD, the stories of Abu Hanifa and Abdul Qadir Gilani were destroyed by the government
 1533 main, turk samrajya ne iraq or abu hanipha or anya sunni sthalon ke madhbaron kaa punarnirmaan kiya
 It is also believed that Abu Hanifa Tabain who was of the later period of Sahaba
 sahaba, mohammad sahab ke anuyaiyon ko kaha jaataa he
 
 Some others say that Abu Hanifa has seen about six Sahabis
 kam Abu Hanifah recited the prayer of Fazer from Isha's wuzu for forty years and he used to recite the Quran throughout the night
 kiratarjunium mahakavi bharavi dwaara saatvin shatee i
 main rachit mahakavy he jise sanskrit sahitya main mahakavyon kii 'vrihattrayee' main sthaan praapt he
 Based on the short story of Arjuna's war with Kiratveshi Shiva described in the Mahabharata, the poet has given a captivating description of politics, religion, diplomacy, socialism, war, politics and life
 yah kavy vibhinn rason se otprot he kintu yah mukhyatah vir ras pradhan rachana he
 There are six famous epics of Sanskrit - Brihattrayi and Minatrayi
 kiratarjanuyium, shishupalavdham or naishadhicharitam – brihattrayee kehalaate hai
 Kumarasambhavam, Raghuvansham and Meghdootam - are called miniatures
 kiratarjunium bharavi kii ekmaatr uplabdh kriti he, jisane ek sangopang mahakavy kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Magha-like poets, following the same, enriched the Sanskrit literature store with this genre and gave it a new height
 kalidas kii laghutrayee or ashwaghosh ke buddhacharitam main mahakavy kii jis dhara kaa darshan hota he, apane vishisht gunon ke hote hue bhi usamen vah vishadta or samagrata nahin he, jiskaa sutarapaat bharavi ne kiya
 There have been at least 37 commentaries of Kiratarajuniyam in Sanskrit, of which the Mallinath commentary is the best
 san 1912 main karl cappalar ne harvard oriyental siries ke antargat kiratarjunium kaa german anuwaad kiya
 There have been more than six translations of its different parts in English as well
 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti main bharavi ke vishesh rujhaan ke chalate yah yuktiyukt hi tha ki ve kiratarjunium kaa kathanak mahabharat se uthaate
 He raised the small theme of acquiring Pashupatastra as a result of Shiva's abject penance by Arjuna for the unfolding of the Pandavas during the exile of the Pandavas from the five chapters of Vanaparva and gave it the form of this epic of eighteen cantos
 jab yudhisthir kauravon ke saath sampann dyutakrida main sab kuch haar gayi to unhen apane bhaaiyon evam draupadi ke saath 13 varsh ke vanvaas par janaa padaa
 Most of his time was spent in dualism
 vanvaas ke kashton se khinn hokar or kauravon dwaara kii gayi sajeesh ko yaad karke draupadi yudhisthir ko aksar prerit karti thim ki ve yuddh kii taiyaari karen or yuddh ke madhyam se kauravon se apana rajpth waapas len
 Bhima also favors Draupadi's talk
 guptchar ke rup main hastinapur bheje gaye ek vanechar se soochna milti he ki duryodhana apane sammilit rajya ke sarvangin vikaas or sudrudhikaran main dattachitt he, kyonki kapat-dyut se hastgat kiye gaye aadhe rajya ke liye use pandavon se ashanka he
 The Pandavas also feel that at the end of the period of exile, half of their kingdom will not be returned without war
 draupadi or bhim yudhisthir ko vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone kii pratiksha na kar duryodhana par turant akraman ke liye uksaate hai, lekin adarshavaadi, kshamashil yudhisthir vyavhaar kii maryaada laanghane ko taiyaar nahin
 Vyas, who has come there, advises that the Pandavas should advance their power for future war
 unheen ke dwaara bataae gaye upaay ke anusaar arjuna shastrastra ke liye indra ko tap se prasann karne ke liye ek yaksha ke maargdarshan main himalay-sthit indrakil parvat kii ore chal padate hai
 Indra is present in the guise of an old sage after taking the test by sending apsaras etc
 as a result of austerities done by building an ashram there and illustrating the importance of charitableness, stating the perishable cosmic goal of austerity
 arjuna isaki kaat main kauravon dwaara kiye gaye chal evam anyaay kaa lekha-jokha prastutkar shatru se pratishodh lene kii anivaaryta, saamaajik kartavya-paalan tathaa anyaay ke pratikaar kaa tark dekar indra ko santusht kar dete hai
 As a result, Indra, appearing in his real form, advises Arjuna to do penance for Shiva for mano-fulfillment
 arjuna phir se ghor, niraahaar tapasya main leen ho jate hai
 Arjuna is a stranger to Indrakil, ascetic, jata, Valkal and mrigacharm, but he also has armor in the body, in place of Yajnopavit, there is a Gandhiv bow with a pratchancha, two huge tarakas and a perfect pillar
 use munidharm-virdohi samajhakar vahaan ke anya tapasvi aatankit hai or shankar ke paas nivedan ke liye pahunch jate hai
 In his order, Shiva, disguised as the commander of the local tribal tribe, arrives to Arjuna with the army of his ganas
 tabhi 'mook' naam kaa ek daanav arjuna kii tapasya ko devataaon kaa kaary samajhakar, vishaal shookar kaa sharir dharankar, usko maarane ke liye jhapatata he
 a similar arrow fired simultaneously by both Shiva and Arjuna ends that pig's illusion
 shiv kaa baan to uske sharir ko bedhta hua dharti main dhans jaataa he or arjuna jab apana baan uske sharir se nikaalane jate hai to shiv apane ek gana ko bhejkar vivaad khadaa kara dete hai
 As a result, a war between the two begins
 arjuna ganon kii sena ko to baan-varsha se bhaagane ko majaboor kar dete hai par shiv ke saath hue yuddh main parrast ho jate hai
 Desperate from defeat, Arjuna recognizes Shiva and surrenders, disguised as Kirat-senapati, leading Shiva to appear happy and impart Pashupatastra to him
 is tarah arjuna kaa mantavya puraa hone ke saath mahakavy-vidha ke bhi saare mantavya siddh ho jate hai
 Apart from this extraterrestrial myth of the Kiratha prostitute Shiva, this episode also has its own specific tribal expression, which brings this poetry closer to the current sentiment
 yudhisthir or guptchar bane vanechar ke bich ghatit samvaad main vanechar kii jo atoot swamibhakti, adamya nirbhikta or ucch raajnneetik samaj saamne aati he, vah vanavaasiyon ke prati bharavi kii pakshabharata main andeh kii koi gunjaaish nahin chhodti
 Vancher makes it clear in the beginning- is puure prakaran ke armbh main draupadi kii baton ke samarthan main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ke prati kuchek nitiwachan kahe gayi hai
 One of them is cited below: bharavi apane arth-gaurav ke liye jane jate hai—‘upama kalidassy bharverrthgauravam’
 His wealth is an ingenious language and expressive skills matching this sense of pride
 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti sahit jivan ke vividh ayaamon main unki asaadhaaran paith he
 The balance earned by the duality of ideals and attitudes and the excesses of excesses of real life makes his writing 'all-rounder'
 lekin bharavi mulat: jivan kii vidambnaaon or visangatiyon ke kavi hai, unka saamana karte hai or unke khurdure yatharth ke bich sangati bithaane kaa prayaas karte hai
 In the first canto of Kiratarajuniyam, in order for Draupadi and Bhima in the second to provoke Yudhishthira to declare war against Duryodhana, and Yudhishthira rejecting him as unjust, Bharvi provided a very meaningful discussion on the duality between the two ends of politics
 is
 isi tarah gyarahawein sarg main moksh ke sthaan par shakti or prabhutaa ke liye kiye ja rahe arjuna ke tap ko indra dwaara garhit bataae jane par, arjuna ke pratyuttar ke rup main bharavi ne jivan-vyavhaar main anyaay ke pratikaar, loukik safalataa, yash or aatm-sammaan ke mahatv par jo gambheer vichaar die hai ve swasth ihlokik jivan kaa ek santulit adarsh kaa chitra upasthit karte hai

 In the first canto of Kiratarajuniyam, in order for Draupadi and Bhima in the second to provoke Yudhishthira to declare war against Duryodhana, and Yudhishthira rejecting him as unjust, Bharvi provided a very meaningful discussion on the duality between the two ends of politics
 is

 For this they inspire Arjuna to please Indra with austerity for high-quality weapons and also leave a Yaksha brought with him which will take Arjuna to a place suitable for Indra's penance
 chauthe sarg main yaksha ke maargdarshan main arjuna kii dwaitvan se himalay tak kii yatra kaa sajiv evam rochak varnan he, jisamen sharad ritu kii thir or sanyat prakruti or uske saath ghule-mili jan-jivan kaa ullas naanaa roopon main tarangit he
 From the journey of Arjuna with the fifth canto Yaksha, Giriraj is enlightened by the vivid, ornamental description of the mountainous region of the Himalayas
 chathe sarg kaa varnya vishay he : arjuna kii aankhon se dekhi indranil kii apratim shobhaa, vahaan pahunchakar arjuna dwaara tap kaa prarambh, prakruti ke vibhinn upaadaanon kaa tap main sahyog, vahaan tainaat vanadevon dwaara amravati pahahunchakar indra ko suchit karnaa, indra dwaara devanganaon ko unke sahchar gandharvon ke saath vahaan jaakar apane haav-bhav or soundarya se arjuna kii tapasya main vighn daalane kaa aadesh dena, taaki unki nishtha kii pariksha ho sake
 In the seventh canto, the Apsaras and their companions Gandharva travel from Amaravati to Indrakil along the banks of the Ganges with special elephants and chariots riding the sky
 indrakil ke paas neeche utarkar ve prithvi-ganga ke ramya tat par apni maaya se gandharva-nagari jaisaa divya shivi bana lete hai
 In the eighth canto, the apsaras leave their camps for forest-hunting
 yahan se shringaar ras kaa rang chadhana shuru hota he, jo isi sarg main varnit jal-krida main gadha hota he or nawein sarg main madh-paan ke saath sampann kaam-keli main apni paraakaashtha par pahunch jaataa he
 The tenth canto is the campaign and failure of Apsaras to grab Arjuna's attention and meditate on him
 gyarahawein sarg main vayovruddh muni ke vesh main indra ke aagaman or unke dwaara tapasya ke sansaarik lakshya kii nissartaa kaa nidarshan he jiske pratyuttar main arjuna loukik jivan ke mulyon, praathamiktaaon kaa apana aakhyaan rachate hai
 At the end of this canto, satisfied with Arjuna's reasoning, Devaraja appears in his form and teaches the worship of Shiva according to his goal
 barahawein sarg main arjuna ghor tapasya armbh kar dete hai jisase ghabaraakar anya sanyasi shankar ke paas ja pahunchate hai

 rajanyik manyata ek rajnatik kriya he, jiske dwaara ek raashtra manyata detaa he, ek duusare raashtra kii, yaa uski sarkaar kii kisi kriya kii, yaa sthiti kii, jiske dwaara yatharthata yaa satyata pramanit hoti he, evam uski manshaa prakat hoti he, us manyata ke gharelu evam anterrashtriya vaidhanik nishkarsh par
 Recognition can be given, real or legal, by a statement of a government that generally gives recognition
 kisi rajya ko manyata pradaan karne se taatpary us kaary se he jiske dwaara koi rajya yah sweekaar karata he ki usne jis rajya ke raajnneetik astitv ko apni manyata pradaan kii he usamen rajtv ke gun vidyaman hai
 In this, any current member of the international family duly gives his approval to a state or a political party
 iskaa arth yah he ki manyata pradaan karanevaale rajya ke mat se ukt rajya antarrashtriya adhikaron or kartavyon kaa saamaanya adhikari he or usamen antarrashtriya vidhaan ke anusaar praapt honevaale dayitvon ko vahan karne kii samarthyan he
 There are two concepts or principles of state recognition
 Sanghatna-dependent hypothesis and 2
 Declarative or declarative design
 sanghatana-nirbhar pariklp ke anusaar koi bhi rajya keval manyata ke dwaara hi antarrashtriya rajya ban jaataa he
 That is, only by the act of recognition, a state gets statehood and the new government there gets the authority in the international arena
 higel is pariklp kaa sarvapratham vyaakhyaata tha
 Later Holland, Oppenheim and others supported him
 duusare pariklp ke anusaar koi bhi rajya apane adhikaar kii bina par antarrashtriya pad or raashtrapariwaar kii sadsyta praapt kar letaa he
 The act of state recognition is a valid validation of the confirmation of this established truth
 haal, fisher, breyarli tathaa anya log is pariklp ke vyaakhyaata hai
 Out of these two votes, it seems reasonable that statehood is mobilization-dependent as well as declarative
 bhinn bhinn tathyasamoohon ke anusaar kisi par pehla pariklp lagu ho saktaa he, kisi par doosraa
 The existence of any political community, it is only state declaration of this general fact
 rajyatv kii aisi ghoshnaa hone se manyata ke kaaran kuch vaidhanik sthitiyaan utpann ho jaati hai
 Most writers today, such as Lanterpash and Stark, propose this view
 manyata dena yaa na dena rajyon kii ichha par nirbhar karata he
 But this desire should not be arbitrary
 kanoonee siddhanton ke anusaar hi rajyamanyata deni yaa na deni chahie
 Yes, it is of course that political and diplomatic ideology has its influence on the acceptance or rejection of statehood
 manyata do prakaar kii ho sakati he - yaa to spasht hogi yaa sanketit
 Explicit recognition occurs when a communiqué is duly released or announced to reveal the idea of recognition
 jaise, us rajya ko yaa us sarkaar ko is aashay kaa patr likhnaa jisane manyata ke liye prarthana kii ho
 Signed recognition is one where recognition is not explicitly revealed, but by its actions it is revealed that acceptance of recognition is unquestionable; For example, a trade pact between two states or a duly consensual relationship between the two states
 vidhik manyata kaa arth yah he ki manyata denevaale rajya ke anusaar jis rajya ko athwa jis sarkaar ko manyata pradaan kii ja rahi he vah antarrashtriya samudaay main sakriy bhaag lene ke liye antarrashtriya vidhaan main pratipaadit aavashyaktaaon kii vidhiwat purti karata he
 Actual recognition means that according to the opinion of the state of recognition, the state or government to which the recognition has been granted, temporarily fulfills those requirements for a short period, although all the requirements are not present and the said The state has not yet attained sufficient fortitude
 vaastavik manyata alpakaaleen hoti he or vah us samay lautaa lee ja sakati he, jab ve aavashyaktaayen, jinka manyata ke liye puraa hona anivaary he, bad main bhi puri nahin ho paatin
 Legal recognition is final and permanent and cannot be returned once given
 kai maamalon main yah baat sweekaar kar lee gai he ki jahaan tak iske kanoonee parinaamon kaa sambandh he, vahaan tak vaastavik manyata or vidhik manyata main koi antar nahin he
 When there is a change in the general and statutory system in the post of president of a state with international distinction, it is informed to other states
 ve rajya ukt rajya ke nae adhyaksh ko apni ore se badhai kaa sandesh bhejkar use apni manyata pradaan karte hai
 There is difficulty in this only when there is a change in the office of the president or in the government through revolution
 aise maamalon main do prakaar ke pareekshan kaam main laae jate hai : pehla pareekshan to yah he ki kya nai sarkaar vaastavik sarkaar he vaastavik sarkaar he, jiskaa rajya par prabhavakaari niyantran he or kya vah ukt pradesh ke paryaapt kshetra par apana prabhutv sthapit kiye hue he tathaa uskaa koi prabhavakaari virdohi paksh nahin he
 This is called external test
 doosraa pareekshan yah hota he ki kya nai sarkaar un dayitvon ko puraa karne main samarth he jo antarrashtriya vidhaan dwaara tathaa rashtrasang ke adhikaarptr dwaara nirdhaarit hai? ise aantarik yaa vishaygat pareekshan kehete hai
 States that are asked to give recognition to a new state or government, they postpone their decision only in cases where the government is not permanent or where revolutions often occur due to which the government changes
 parantu kisi sarkaar ko manyata dene athwa na dene se swayan rajya kii manyata kaa koi sambandh nahin he
 The state remains recognized as an international entity
 kai deshon main prachlit paripati ke anusaar rajyon ko di gai manyata purvakalik prabhaav rakhti he or nyaayalay nae rajya yaa nai sarkaar ke un sabhi kaaryon kaa vaid sweekaar rakate hai jo navamaanya sarkaar dwaara uske haath main satta aane ke prarambh se kiye jate hai
 Consequences of recognition - The following are the main results of recognition of a new state or new government: manyata praapt karne ke uparaant - ukt rajya ko athwa sarkaar ko yah kshamta mil jaati he ki vah manyata pradaan karanevaale rajyon ke saath koi sandhi kar sake athwa kootnithik sambandh sthapit kar le
 The said state is empowered to file suit in the courts of the accrediting states
 manyataprapt rajya ko manyata pradaan karanevaale rajyon ke nyaayalayon ke adhikarashetra se apane sambandh main tathaa apni sampatti ke sambandh main unmukti yaa chhot praapt ho jaati he
 The recognized state also gets the right to demand and acquire any property of its predecessor government within the territory of a recognized state
 yadi kisi desh main grihayuddh chhid jaae to kud sharten puri hone par vidrohiyon ko yuddhrat ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he, jaise- Civil war with widespread hostility
 rajdrohiyon dwaara rashtriya seemaakshatra ke paryaapt kshetra par aadhipaty sthapit kar lenaa or usapar vyavasthit shashan prabandh chalaanaa
 To abide by the rules of war by the treason under any responsible power
 anya-tisare-rajyon ke liye grihayuddh ke sambandh main arthath apane rukh kii vyakhya karne kii vyaavhaarik aavashyaktaa kaa utpann ho janaa
 If there is a situation that only a few of these conditions are fulfilled, then other states can confer rebellion as a traitor and consider them to be de facto officers of the area where their authority is established, not law-breakers
 Ho
 yon samaanyat: koi rajya yadi kisi rajya ko manyata de detaa he to vah kisi raajnneetik uddeshy se uski manyata waapas nahin le saktaa
 But in certain circumstances, recognition can be withdrawn
 udaahranarth, yadi koi rajya apni swatantraaa kho baithta he, athwa uski sarkaar prabhaavashunya ho jaati he, athwa grihayuddh main koi yudhyamaan paksh parajeet ho jaataa he to aisi sthiti main rajya kii manyata waapas lee ja sakati he
 Purda is an Islamic term that came from the Persian language in Arabic
 iskaa arth hota he "dhaknaa" yaa "alag karnaa"
 One aspect of the curtain practice is the practice of burqa
 burka ek tarah kaa ghunghat he jo muslim samudaay kii mahilaayein or ladkiyaan kuch khaas jagahon par khud ko purushon kii nigaah se alag / dur rakhane ke liye istemaal karti hai
 In India, the curtain practice among Hindus is a product of Islam

 This practice greatly strengthened its roots during the Mughal rulers

 There are many disadvantages of keeping this system in the society
 bharat ke sandarbh main isa se 500 varsh purv rachit 'nirukt' main is tarah kii pratha kaa varnan kahin nahin miltaa
 There is a mention of the arrival of women in courts to settle property related matters among the accused
 nyaayalayon main unki upasthiti ke liye kisi pardaa vyavastha kaa vivaran isa se 200 varsh purv tak nahin miltaa
 In the ancient Vedas and Samhita before this period, there is no description of Parda system
 pracheen rugveda kaal main logon ko vivaah ke samay kanya kii ore dekhne ko kaha he- iske liye rugveda main mantra bhi he jiskaa saar he ki "yah kanya mangalamay he, ekatra ho or ise dekho, ise ashish dekar hi tum log apane ghar ja sakate ho
 According to "ashavalayanagrihyasutra", while bringing the bride to her house, the groom should show it to the audience at each investment place and get the blessings of the elders and the affection of the younger ones
 isse spasht he ki un dinon vadhuon dwaara pardaa dhaaran nahin kiya jaataa tha, balki ve sabhi ke samaksh khule sir se hi aati thim
 The mention of the Purdah system first appears to have occurred since the time of the Mughals' invasion of India
 is sambandh main kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar 'ramayana' or 'mahabharat' kaaleen striyaan kisi bhi sthaan par pardaa athwa ghunghat kaa prayog nahin karti thim
 Ajanta and Sanchi artifacts also show women without a veil
 manu or yajyavlky ne striyon kii jivan style ke sambandh main kai niyam banaae hue hai, parantu kahin bhi yah nahin kaha he ki striyon ko parde main rahanaa chahie
 Most Sanskrit plays also do not mention curtains
 yahaan tak ki 10veen shatabdi ke prarambh kaal ke samay tak bhi bhartiya raaj pariwaron kii striyaan bina parde ke sabha main tathaa ghar se baahar bhraman karti thim, yah varnan swayan ek arab yatri abu jaid ne apane lekhan ke jariye kiya he

 a standard company's balance sheet has three parts: assets, liabilities and proprietary equity
 The main categories of assets are usually listed first
 parisampattiyon ke saath deytaon kaa lekha-jokha hota he
 The differences between assets and liabilities are known as equity or net assets or net assets or capital of the company and according to the accounting equation the value of net assets should be equal to assets excluding liabilities
 isi sameekaran ko jaanchane kaa ek anya tarika yah bhi he ki aastiyaan deytaon or swami ke equity ke yoga ke baraabar hoti hai
 Looking at the equation this way shows how the assets are financed: by borrowing cash or using the owner's money
 The balance sheet usually has a "balance" of the two parts with assets in one part and liabilities in the other and details of net worth

 If a business operates only through cash transactions, it can assess its income at the end of that period by taking out the bank balance and the sum of cash lying in hand
 haalanki kai vyavsaayon main turant bhugtan nahin hota he; ve company ke stock kii suchi taiyaar karte hai, apni imaaraton va upkarnon kaa adhigrahan karte hai
 In other words: There are assets in business and they cannot immediately convert their goods into cash, even at the end of each period
 Often these businesses owe cash to suppliers and tax authorities and the business owners do not raise their total principal capital and profits at the end of each period
 duusare shabdon main kaarobaar main dendariyaan bhi hoti hai
 This Dutch mathematician, Simon Stavin, in his book Wisconstigheg hedachtenissen's chapter titled Coopmansbouckhouding op de Italiaensche wyse, persuaded traders to make a rule giving a brief account of accounts at the end of each year

 As a form of expressive therapy, dance therapy focuses on the relationship between body movements and emotion
 ek theth nrity chikitsa satr ke chaar mukhya charan hai: taiyaari, ooshmaayan, prakaashan, or moolyankan
 DMT is practiced in various clinical settings and is used for psychotherapy purposes and physical therapy
 nrity hajaaron saal ke liye upachaaratmak istemaal kiya gaya he
 It has been used since early human history as a healing ritual under the influence of fertility, birth, disease, and death

 " dance movement therapy kii duusari lahar 1980 ke 1970 ke dashak ke aasapaas aayaa tha or yah america chikitsak se zyada byaaj foot padaa
 During this time, therapists began experimenting with mental applications of dance and movement
 chikitsak prayogon kii ek parinaam ke rup main, dance therapy ko manochikitsa kaa ek vidhi ke rup main vargeekrut kiya gaya
 The principle of dance therapy is mainly based on the notion of body and mind influencing each other
 man sharir ke aadhaar par vyakti ke chalan, kul kaamkaaj ko prabhavit karata he, or bhi vyakti ke vyaktitv ko darshata he
 Therefore, the therapist – client relationship is partially based on non-verbal formulas such as body language
 nrity chalan ek pratikatmak samaaroh mana jaataa he or jaise swayan ko samajhane main sahaayta kar saktaa hai
 In dance therapy, the client can consciously perceive early relationships with negative stimuli through non-verbal mediation by the therapist, allowing one to experiment with a way or new way of providing channels

 Dance therapy is different from other forms of rehabilitation treatment because it allows creative expression and is more holistic, it treats the whole person, meaning: mind, body, and soul
 chikitsa prakriya chaar charnon main he or dance therapy ke dauraan chikitsak or rogi donon ke liye ek rachanaatmak samay ho saktaa he
 Each stage is set by a small set of correlative goals for the larger purpose of dance therapy
 dance therapy or charnon ke lakshyon prayek vyakti ke saath badalati hai
 The four stages are: Preparation: Warm-up stage, a safe place to be familiar with moving with no barriers, nor a supportive relationship with a witness, with the participants resting their eyes closed

 Illumination: The process in which the participant uncovers and resolves the subconscious intent is integrated through conscious awareness through interaction with witness, self reflection, heightened self awareness, which can have positive and negative effects
 moolyankan: antardrushti or prakriya ke mahatv par charchaa, chikitsa samaapt karne ke liye taiyaar In DMT, a variety of dance styles are used depending on the needs of the client
 inamen shaamil hai:aadhunik nrity kaa shuddh tatwon par jor dene ke saath, chalan, pramanik chalan, turki nrity, bollroom dance, tango, waltz, foxtrot, aerobics nrity, rekha nrity or sharir manochikitsa
