 However some squirrels also eat meat, especially when they are very hungry
 Squirrels are also known to eat insects, eggs, small birds, young snakes and small rodents

 Predatory behavior has also come to light by several species of land-dwelling squirrels, especially those ground squirrels with thirteen stripes on their bodies
 For example, the ballet saw a thirteen-striped ground squirrel hunting for a small chick
 Wistrand saw a squirrel of the same species eating the killed snake immediately
 Whittaker tested the stomachs of 139, thirteen striped squirrels and found four pieces of bird meat while one found remains of small-tailed mole, Bradley, during a white-tailed antelope squirrel's stomach test, about 609 specimens Out of 10 percent remains of some type of reeded animals, mainly rodents and lizards
 Morgart saw a white-tailed antelope squirrel catching and eating a small silky rat

 unhone aglaa parishkrut hawa main jvalansheel hawa jalane se pani ke utpaadan par ek patr prakashit kiya, baad main vayumandaleey hawa ke ghatak ko prakashit kiya
 Cavendish concluded that refined refined air was refined water and stated that hydrogen was either pure flammability or refined water

 The Scottish inventor James Watt published a research paper on water composition in 1783; Cavendish performed the experiments first but was published in the second turn

 In 1785 the Cavendish mango air structure came out of an investigation, and achieved impressively accurate results
 unhone hydrogen main prayogon kaa aayojan kiya or saadhaaran hawa anupaat main sanyukt gyaat kiya or phir bijli kii ek chingaari ke saath visphot kiya
 In addition, he also described an experiment in which he was able to remove, in modern terminology, both the oxygen and nitrogen gases from a sample of atmospheric air until only a small bubble of uncreated gas was left in the original sample
 Using his observations, cavendish observed that, when he had determined the amounts of phlogisticated air and dephlogisticated air, there remained a volume of gas amounting to 1 / 120 of the original volume of nitrogen
 By careful measurements he was led to conclude that, "common air consists of one part of dephlogisticated air, mixed with four of phlogisticated"
 In the 1890s two British physicists, William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh, realized that their newly discovered inert gas, argon, was responsible for Cavendish's problematic residue; he had not made an error
 What he had done was perform rigorous quantitative experiments, using standardized instruments and methods, aimed at reproducible results; taken the mean of the result of several experiments; and identified and allowed for sources of error
 The balance that he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, was the first of the precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier's 
 Cavendish worked with his instrument makers, generally improving existing instruments rather than inventing wholly new ones
 Cavendish, as indicated above, used the language of the old phlogiston theory in chemistry
 In 1787 he became one of the earliest outside France to convert to the new antiphlogistic theory of Lavoisier, though he remained skeptical about the nomenclature of the new theory
 He also objected to Lavoisier's identification of heat as having a material or elementary basis
 Working within the framework of Newtonian mechanism, Cavendish had tackled the problem of the nature of heat in the 1760s, explaining heat as the result of the motion of matter
 In 1783 he published a paper on the temperature at which mercury freezes and in that paper made use of the idea of latent heat, although he did not use the term because he believed that it implied acceptance of a material theory of heat
 He made his objections explicit in his 1784 paper on air
 He went on to develop a general theory of heat, and the manuscript of that theory has been persuasively dated to the late 1780s
 His theory was at once mathematical and mechanical; it contained the principle of the conservation of heat and even implied the concept of the mechanical equivalent of heat
 Following his father's death, Henry bought another house in town and also a house in Clapham Common, to the south of London
 The London house contained the bulk of his library, while he kept most of his instruments at Clapham Common, where he carried out most of his experiments
 The most famous of those experiments, published in 1798, was to determine the density of the Earth and became known as the Cavendish experiment
 The apparatus Cavendish used for weighing the Earth was a modification of the torsion balance built by Englishman and geologist John Michell, who died before he could begin the experiment
 The apparatus was sent in crates to Cavendish, who completed the experiment in 1797–1798 and published the results
 The experimental apparatus consisted of a torsion balance with a pair of 2-inch 1
61-pound lead spheres suspended from the arm of a torsion balance and two much larger stationary lead balls 
 Cavendish intended to measure the force of gravitational attraction between the two
 He noticed that Michell's apparatus would be sensitive to temperature differences and induced air currents so he made modifications by isolating the apparatus in a separate room with external controls and telescopes for making observations
 Using this equipment, cavendish calculated the attraction between the balls from the period of oscillation of the torsion balance, and then he used this value to calculate the density of the Earth
 Cavendish found that the Earth's average density is 5
48 times greater than that of water
 John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5
448, and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations cavendish included in his paper
 What was extraordinary about cavendish's experiment was its elimination of every source of error and every factor that could disturb the experiment and its precision in measuring an astonishingly small attraction, a mere 1 / 50,000,000 of the weight of the lead balls

 Based on its results, calculating the value of a g that is 6
754 × 10−11n-m2 / kg2 compares favorably with the modern value 6
67428 × 10−11n-m2 / kg2
 Books often describe Cavendish's work as a measurement of either the gravitational constant or the Earth's mass
 Since these are related to the Earth's density by a trivial web of algebraic relations, none of these sources are wrong, but they do not match the exact word choice of Cavendish, and this mistake has been pointed out by several authors
 Cavendish's stated goal was to measure the Earth's density, although his result obviously calculates g in order to do so
 The first time that the constant got this name was in 1873, almost 100 years after the cavendish experiment, but the constant was in use since the time of Newton
 Cavendish's results obviously also give the Earth's mass
 Cavendish's electrical and chemical experiments, like those on heat, had begun while he lived with his father in a laboratory in their London house
 Lord Charles Cavendish died in 1783, leaving almost all of his very substantial estate to Henry
 Like his theory of heat, Cavendish's comprehensive theory of electricity was mathematical in form and was based on precise quantitative experiments
 In 1771 he published an early version of his theory, based on an expansive electrical fluid that exerted pressure
 He demonstrated that if the intensity of electric force was inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid in excess of that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally
 Cavendish continued to work on electricity after this initial paper, but he published no more on the subject
 Cavendish wrote papers on electrical topics for the Royal Society but the bulk of his electrical experiments did not become known until they were collected and published by James Clerk Maxwell a century later, in 1879, long after other scientists had been credited with the same results
 Cavendish's electrical papers from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London have been reprinted, together with most of his electrical papers, in The Scientific Papers of the Honourable Henry Cavendish, FRS
 According to the 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, among Cavendish's discoveries were the concept of electric potential, an early unit of capacitance, the formula for the capacitance of a plate capacitor, the concept of the dielectric constant of a material, the relationship between electric potential and current, cavendish kii 1810 main mrityu ho gai or unhen ab darbi cathedral he ki carch main unke kai purvajon ke saath dafnaaya gaya tha
 The road he lived on in Derby has since been named after him
 The University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory was endowed by one of Cavendish's later relatives, William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire 
 Cavendish was a shy man who was uncomfortable in society and avoided it when he could
 He conversed little, always dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and developed no known deep personal attachments outside his family
 Cavendish was taciturn and solitary and regarded by many as eccentric
 He only communicated with his female servants by notes
 By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house in order to avoid encountering his housekeeper because he was especially shy of women
 The contemporary accounts of his personality have led some modern commentators, such as Oliver Sacks, to speculate that he had Asperger syndrome, though he may merely have been anthropophobic
 His only social outlet was the Royal Society Club, whose members dined together before weekly meetings
 
 Cavendish seldom missed these meetings, and was profoundly respected by his contemporaries
 However his shyness made those who "sought his views 


 speak as if into vacancy
 If his remarks were 


 worthy, they might receive a mumbled reply, but more often than not they would hear a peeved squeak and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of cavendish fleeing to find a more peaceful corner "
 Cavendish's religious views were also considered eccentric for his time
 He was considered to be agnostic
 As his biographer, George Wilson, comments, "as to Cavendish's religion, he was nothing at all"
 He also enjoyed collecting fine furniture exemplified by his purchase of a set of "ten inlaid satinwood chairs with matching cabriole legged sofa"

 Because of his asocial and secretive behaviour, Cavendish often avoided publishing his work, and much of his findings were not even told to his fellow scientists
 In the late nineteenth century, long after his death, James Clerk Maxwell looked through Cavendish's papers and found things for which others had been given credit
 Examples of what was included in Cavendish's discoveries or anticipations were Richter's law of reciprocal proportions, Ohm's law, Dalton's law of partial pressures, principles of electrical conductivity, and Charles's law of gases
 a manuscript "heat", tentatively dated between 1783 and 1790, describes a "mechanical theory of heat"
 Hitherto unknown, the manuscript was analyzed in the early 21st century
 Historian of science Russell mccormmach proposed that "heat" is the only 18th century work prefiguring thermodynamics
 Theoretical physicist Dietrich Belitz concluded that in this work Cavendish "got the nature of heat essentially right
" As Cavendish performed his famous density of the Earth experiment in an outbuilding in the garden of his Clapham Common estate, his neighbors would point out the building and tell their children that it was where the world was weighed
 In honor of Henry Cavendish's achievements and due to an endowment granted by Henry's relative William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, the University of Cambridge's physics laboratory was named the Cavendish Laboratory by James Clerk Maxwell, the first Cavendish Professor of Physics and an admirer of Cavendish's work

 valeri Leontiev discography The Soviet Union never participated in the Eurovision Song Contest, but it was in many attempts in the late 1980s
 In 2009 Edward Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education's RSFSR, revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, Minister of Education brought forward to the Soviet Union, the idea of the Soviet participation in the Soviet contest due to the number of political reforms made by President Soviet The late 1980s during Mikhail Gorbachev of the Union
 The idea was primarily a political one, with a thought that one would win the competition in the Soviet Union would have influence on the relationship between the Soviet Union and the capitalist countries in the West

 He was a great inventor and had incomparable support in the development of visionaries
 is mahaan vichaarak kaa janm aadhunik italy ke pisa naamak shahar main ek sangitajna parivaar main hua tha
 The city of Pisa, modern Italy, had historically blamed the birth of the great scientist Galileo Galilei on 15 February 1564 as a flaw in the creation of God
 galileo ke dwaara pratipaadit sindvanto se dharmik manyataon kaa khandan hota tha jiske liye galileo ko ishwariya manyataon se chhedchhad karne ke liye sari umr karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 His father Vincenzo Galilei was a well-known music expert of the time
 ve "lut" naamak vaadya yantra bajaate the, yahi lut naamak yantra baad main guitar or benzo ke rup main viksit hua
 During his musical composition, Vincenzo Galilei intimately studied the tension of the stringed string or the string and the tones emanating from it, and found that there is a connection between the tension of the string and the string
 pita ke dwaara sangeet ke liye tani huyi dori yaa taar se nikalne vaali dhvaniyon ke antarasambandhon ke parinaamon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan unke putr galileo dwaara kiya gaya
 During the course of this study, the child Galileo was inspired to assimilate his results by doing a thorough experiment in his mind
 inako pariksha mulak vigyaan kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He gave the oscillation formula
 inhone doorabeen kaa avishkaar kiya
 He made the visionary device more advanced

 He is considered the father of modern experimental astronomy
 unhone paaya ki prakruti ke niyam ek duusare karkon se prabhavit hote hai or kisi ek ke badhane or ghatane ke bich ganit ke samikarnon jaise hi sambandh hote he
 That is why he said: - 'the language of God is mathematics
 ‘is mahaan ganitagya or vaigyanik ne hi prakaash kii gati ko naapane kaa saahas kiya
 For this, Galileo and one of his assistants sat on two mountain peaks located several miles away in the dark night
 jahaan se galileo ne laalaten jalaakar rakhi, apane sahaayak kaa sanket paane ke baad unhen laalaten or uske khatke ke madhyam se prakaash kaa sanket dena tha
 His assistant on the second hill had to see the light of the lantern and remove the sign of the second lantern kept near him
 is prakaar duusari pahaad kii chotii par chamakate prakaash ko dekhakar galileo ko prakaash kii gati kaa akalan karnaa tha
 Thus, the results that Galileo achieved were not real to a large extent, but the frequency and success of the experiments, the failure to achieve the desired results only after the failure was unique
 kaalaantar main prakaash kii gati or urja ke sambandhon kii jatil gulthi ko sulajhane vaale mahaan vaigyanik albert ainstin ne isi kaaran unhen ‘aadhunik vigyaan kaa pita ‘ ke naam se sambodhit kiya
 Galileo was religious but wanted to sidestep the old religious beliefs through rationality and experimentation
 varsh 1609 main galileo ko ek aisi doorabeen kaa pataa chalaa jiskaa avishkaar holland main hua tha, is doorabeen kii sahaayta se duurastha khagoleey pindon ko dekh kar unki gati kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa tha
 Galileo himself heard this and built a telescope that was more powerful than the indiscriminate telescope in Holland
 iske aadhaar par apane prekshan tathaa prayogon ke madhyam se galileo ne yah paaya ki purv main vyaapt manyataon ke vipareet brihamand main sthit prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he
 Earlier, Copernicus also said that all the planets including the Earth revolve around the Sun, for which they had to be angry with the Church
 ab prayog ar vivek par aadhaarit parinaamon ke aadhaar par galiliye ne bhi yahi hona sidv paaya
 Till that time, it was universally accepted that the Earth is located in the center of the universe and all the celestial bodies including the sun and the moon revolve around the earth continuously
 is manyata ko tadsamay ke dharmacharyon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Due to the results obtained on the basis of his experiments, Galileo decided to stand against the old concepts
 jab galileo ne yah sidwant saarvajanik kiya to carch ne ise apni avagya mana or is avagya ke liye galileo ko carch kii ore se karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 The idea given by Galileo forced the new man to accept a new form of direction of contemplation
 saamaajik or dharmik pratadna ke chalate purv se vyaapt manyataon or vishwaason ke vipareet pratipaadit sindvanto ke saath ve adhik din tak khadey nahin rah sake
 In 1633, 69-year-old Old Galileo was ordered by the Church to publicly apologize, saying that his doctrine against religious beliefs was the biggest mistake of his life for which he is ashamed
 unhone aisa hi kiya parantu iske baad bhi unhen karawas main daal diya gaya
 His health continued to deteriorate and due to this, the sentence of imprisonment was changed to house-imprisonment i
e
 imprisonment in his own house
 apane jivan kaa aakhri din bhi unhone isi kaid main hi bitaayaa
 The supreme institution of Christianity, always under the supervision of the Pope, in Vatican City, admitted in 1992 that he had made a mistake in deciding Galileo's case
 is prakaar ek mahaan khagol vigyaani, ganitagya, bhautikavid evam darshanik galileo ke sambandh main 1633 main jari aadesh kar apni aitihaasik bhul sweekaar karne main carch ko saade teen sau saalon se bhi adhik kaa samay laga
 Four hundred years after the creation of binoculars and the observation of celestial bodies in the year 1609, the year 400 was celebrated as the International Year of Astronomy as the 400th birth anniversary and paid tribute to this great scientist and tried to make a mistake

 Macdonald raajnneeti praveshdwar The constitution of the United Kingdom refers to the set of laws and principles under which the United Kingdom is governed
 anya deshon ke samvidhan purnatah likhit rup main hai kintu euke kaa koi mul sanvaidhanik dastavej nahin he
 That is why it is often said that the UK constitution is unwritten, encoded
 kintu 'alikhit' shabd praayah bhraamak he kyonki britani samvidhan kaa adhikansh bhaag vibhinn roopon main likhit rup main he
 @sureshpatelsa british samvidhan kii visheshtaayen : The British Constitution is called the "mother of constitutions" because the oldest constitution served as a guide for all subsequent constitutions
 vedh rajtantr vaadi britain main hi aadhunik vishwa kii pehali prajatantric shashan pranali astitv main aayi 
 Despite the monarchy in Britain, which was inspired by oligarchy, democratic institutions and representative rule developed and the unwritten British constitution was affected by monarchy, oligarchy and democracy
 british samvidhan kii visheshtaon ko in sandarbhon main hi nimnanusaar samajha ja saktaa hai: 1
 Unwritten Constitution: vishwa ke vibhinn pragatisheel deshon ke samvidhan jahaan likhit he, british samvidhan alikhit he 
 Not only this, most of the rules of government work, etc
 are also unwritten
 vastutah british samvidhan kaa vikaas kramik rup se anya sansthaaon ke vikaas ke saath hua or use kabhi lekhabaddh nahin kiya gaya kyonki uski jarurat unhen mahasoos nahin hui 
 The main reason behind this is his practical and clear thinking
 vidhi ke shashan kaa pratik britain bina likhit samvidhan ke is pratik ko banaaye hue he, yah vilakshan visheshta he 
 But it is also a fact that in the form of written judicial decisions, parliamentary acts and mandates, the constitution has also been partially authored
 aisa samvidhan ko likhit swaroop dene ke uddeshy se nahin hua he 
 This is why the British Constitution is an unwritten document
 2
 paramparaagat rup se kramik vikaas: The British constitution was not made by sitting in one place in a day or in a year
 iskaa vikaas paanchavin sadi se lekar aaj tak nirantar rup se hua or ho rahaa he 
 Most of the basic principles or logic of this constitution are based on traditions
 je
es
mil ne in paramparaon ko ”samvidhan ke alikhit nitiwachan” kii sangya di he 
 Although these traditions are not enforceable by the court, they are still humane and nurturing in the system of governance there
 unka mahatv isi baat main he ki unke bina british raaj vyavastha kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati 
 like: taj kaa mantrimandal ke paraamarsh se kaam karnaa 
 Appointing the leader of the majority party of the House of Representatives as the Prime Minister by the Taj
 jan pratinidhi sadan ke prati mantrimandal kaa samuhik or vyactik uttardaayitv 
 Approval by Parliament by Parliament Acts
 pradhanmantri kii salaah par janpratinidhi sadan kii taj dwaara samaapti 
 Governance to be accountable to the people
 apni pustak ”thots on da constitution” main el
 es
 emry kehete hai ki ”british samvidhan kanoon, purvavartita tathaa parampara kaa mishran he 
 " 3
 siddhant evam vyavhaar main antar: In Britain, the unwritten principles of the Constitution are prevalent but there are some differences in practice
 jaise: Britain considers the rule of law to be the last, but the prevalence of administrative law is increasing there
 vahaan siddhanthata sansadeey prajatantr he lekin naam maatr kii karypalika nirvaachit nahin vanshanugat he taj 
 According to Monroe, "one of the unique features of the British Constitution is that it is not what it looks like and does not look like it is
" ” 4
 Parliamentary democracy: prajatantr kaa sansadeey swaroop britain kii dein he 
 In the British parliamentary system: dohari karypalika he- taj ke rup main naam maatr kii karypalika or mantriparishad ke rup main vaastavik karypalika 
 Taj is the head of state while the Council of Ministers is the head of government
 yahaan vidhayika se sarkaar nikalati he arthath mantriparishad or vidhayika main sajaateey sambandh hai 
 The people's representative forms the majority government in the House
 or sarkaar isi sadan ke prati uttaradaayi hoti he 
 This responsibility is both collective of ministers and individual ministers
 pradhanmantri kii salaah par taj nimna sadan ko bhang kar saktaa he 
 Britain has a unique republic
 kyonki is loktantric desh main vaid rajtantr maujuud he 
 The crown is not elected and is a hereditary position
 taj jis vyakti ke sar par rakh diya jaataa he, vah raja ban jaataa he 
 This fire is therefore called this "muktadhari" Republic
 5
 sansadeey sarvocchata: The basis of British polity is the principle of parliamentary supremacy
 isse aashay he ki: Parliament has the ultimate right to make, amend or repeal any law
 de lolme kehete hai- ”british sansad kisi aurat ko aadmi or aadmi ko aurat se badalane ke sivaa kuch bhi kar sakati he 
 " british sansad ek hi saamaanya prakriya se saamaanya yaa vishisht yaa sanvaidhanik kanoon banaati he 
 British laws cannot be challenged in court
 taj ko sansadeey kanoonon par hastakshar karne hi hote hai 
 Bezhot writes: "if both the houses of Parliament pass his death order and send it to him, then we will have to sign it too
 ” 6
 Method of salmon: britain vidhi ke shashan ke liye vishwa vikhyath he kyonki vidhi ke shashan kii na sirf yaheen se shuruuaat hui apitu apane shreshthatam arth main vah britain main hi lagu he 
 Rule of law means - supremacy of common law
 diasi ne ”di laa of costitution” main vidhi ke shashan ke teen arth bataaye hai: Supremacy of common law: desh main saamaanya kanoon hi sarvocch he, jis par kisi swechhachari shakti kaa prabhaav nahin he 
 Each person is governed only by law
 kanoon ke samaksh samanta: All persons are equal before the law irrespective of their social, economic, political status
 sabake liye ek hi kanoon he 
 The Constitution itself is the result of law: england main naagarik adhikaron kaa strot saamaanya kanoon he jo nyaayik nirnyon ke dwaara lagu he 
 Legislation itself has evolved as a result of these decisions-laws
 7
 lachilaapan: The Constitution of Britain is lax in nature and can be easily amended
 vahaan saamaanya kanoon or sanvaidhanik kanoon main antar nahin kiya jaataa arthath sanshodhan usee saamaanya sansadeey prakriya se ho jate hai jisase saamaanya kanoon banaaye jate hai 
 8
 Unitary Constitution: british samvidhan ekahara samvidhan he 
 It is not only one for the whole of Great Britain, but it also ensures a single citizenship, a single law, etc
 9
 naagarik adhikaar: The British constitution provides many rights to citizens such as the freedom of the body, freedom of assembly, freedom of arms, freedom of expression, etc
 10
 ekaatmak rajya: The British constitution declares the whole of Britain as a "unitary state" in place of the Union
 isamen sampurna shakti centre sarkaar main nihit maani jaati he or vah apni shashan suvidha ke liye kshetreey ikaiyaan, sthaneey sarkaar aadi kaa gathan or vighatan kar sakati he 
 11
 two-party Political System: britain ne sansadeey prajatantr ko apanaate hue bhi bahudaleey ke sthaan par dwi-daleey vyavastha ko apanaaya he 
 Here two parties named Anudar Dal and Mazdoor Dal exist
 12
 samvidhan ke poorak adhinium: Despite the absence of a written constitution in Britain, there are acts that have constitutional significance, such as the Hebius Coppers Act State of Westminster, the Ministers of Crown Act, the People's Representation Act, etc
