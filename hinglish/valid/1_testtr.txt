 There was a long-standing demand for medical colleges and universities to stop large-scale rigging at the time of appearing in the medical graduate course
 iske liye kendrikrut pravesh pariksha pranali lagu karne kaa suzav diya ja rahaa tha
 This process was applicable in engineering colleges but due to reluctance of private colleges and state governments, no steps were being taken in this direction
 isse pehle yah pariksha 'eipamti' kehalaati thi
 This examination used to take place all over the country
 is pariksha main aae ankon ke aadhaar par hi chaatro ko kendra sarkaar dwaara sanchalit medical sansthaanon main pravesh diya jaataa tha
 But the government decided to conduct an examination for admission to medical colleges across the country to establish transparency, high standards in medical education and to protect students from the burden of multiple examinations
 neet pravesh pariksha kendriya madhyamik shiksha board yani sibiesai dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It is not hidden that there is competition for admission in medical institutions
 chunki chikitsa vigyaan kii padhai ke baad rojgaar kii us tarah samasya nahin rahati jaise duusare takneekee paathyakramon ke baad rahati he
 Therefore, there is more rush for admission in the course
 chunki nijee sansthaanon main management cote kaa praavdhaan he or daakhile ke liye college khud sharten tay karte hai, isliye vahaan zyaadaatar siton par paise vaale logon ke bachche kabiz ho jate hai
 In these courses, there is a queue of people who give their money

 But some states had objected that this may make it difficult to prepare uniform syllabus in regional language and conduct entrance examinations etc
 isi aadhaar par centre ne adhisuchana taiyaar kii thi
 But the legal hurdle was whether the government can bring an ordinance against any decision of the Supreme Court? The President took legal advice on this and finally cleared the ordinance
 is tarah chikitsa sansthaanon main daakhile ke samay cote ko lekar chalane vaali dhaandhlee ruk jaaegi
 So far, the quota prescribed for management, NRI etc
 in private and government colleges, the colleges themselves decide the conditions for admission

 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ingénierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'
 nikat bhootkaal main abhiyantriki shabd kaa jo arth kosh main miltaa tha vah sankshep main is prakaar bataaya ja saktaa he ki But this limited definition could no longer run
 abhiyantriki shabd kaa arth ab ek ore nabhikeey abhiyantriki ke ucch vaigyanik or pravidhik kshetra se lekar maanviya gunon se sambandhit vishyon, jaise shramik niyantran prabandheey kaaryakshmata, samay or gati kaa adhyayan ityadi, anek praayogic vigyaanon ke vistrut kshetra ko ghere hue he
 Thus it would be more appropriate to define engineering as "it is the science and art of efficient use of natural means for the physical service of man"
 aitihaasik rup se ejiniyari kaa upyog sabase pehle sena or sainik kaaryon main hua
 After this, when it started being used for civil works, the new branch was named - 'civil Engineering'
 samay ke saath ejiniyari ke anya kshetron kaa vikaas hua jinaki prakruti civil ejiniyari se bhi alag thi or unhen 'yantric ejiniyari', 'vaidyut ejiniyari' aadi naam diya gaya
 Civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering are the traditional branches of engineering

 In order to get a proper knowledge of the vast area that the word engineering has covered, it would be enlightening to give the names of the subjects under its various branches as examples
 jaanapad athwa asainik abhiyantriki ke antargat agralikhit vishay he : sadaken, rail, nautaran maarg, saamudr abhiyantriki, band, apaksharannirodh, baadh niyantran, naunivesh, pattan, jalawaahiki, jalavidyutsakti, jalavigyaan, sinchai, bhumisudhar, nadiniyantran, nagarpalika abhiyantriki, sthavar sampada, moolyankan, shilpabhiyantriki, purvanirmit bhawan, dhvanivigyaan, sanvathan, nagar tathaa gram pariyojna, jalsangrahan or vitaran, jalotsaaran, mahapvahan, kooday-kachade kaa apvahan, sanrachnik abhiyantriki, pul, kancreet, jaetvik sanrachanaayen, purvapratibalit kancreet, neenv, sanjan, bhusurvekshan, saamudrapareekshan, photography surveykshan, parivahan, bhuvigyaan, dravayantriki, pratikruti, vishleshan, mrudayantriki, jalsravi staron main chikani mitti pravisht karnaa, shailapoorit band, mrittika band, pooran kii reetiyaan, jalaashyon main jal risaav ke adhyayan ke liye vikiransheel samasthanikon kaa prayog, avsaad ke ghanatv ke liye gamma kirnon kaa prayog
 Mechanical engineering includes engineering, vibration, shipbuilding, heat transfer, refrigeration related to mechanics, thermodynamics, water vapor, diesel and tarnishing, mechanics, meteorology, instrumentation, hydropower, metallurgy, aeronautics, motorcars, etc
 vaidyut abhiyantriki main vidyudyantr, vidyut-shakti-utpaadan, sancharna tath vitaran, jalavidyut, radiosampark, vidyutmapan, vidyudadhishthapan, atyucchavriti kaary, nabhikeey abhiyantriki, electraniki hai

 The uninterrupted inspection of both experimental and natural phenomena and the careful use of the fruits of this type of inspection on engineering problems in such a way that the minimum expenditure of time and money gives maximum service to the society is the major method of engineering
 shuddh vaigyanik abhiyantriki kii ulajhanon ko sulajhane kii reeti vaigyanik chaahe khoj paae hon yaa na paae hon, abhiyantaa ko to apana kaary puraa karnaa hi hoga
 In such a situation, the engineer resorts to experimental analysis to some extent and finds a solution that can work in a way that, while properly managing the defense, can make his daily problems solvable
 jais-jaise sambandhit vaigyanik ansh kaa uskaa gyaan achook hota jaataa he, vah raksha ke prabandh main kami karke vyay bhi gata saktaa he
 The intellectual and functional consideration of the problems has also enabled the engineer to enter into those fields which are believed to be concerned with scientist, doctor, economist, manager, humanistic science and art from the beginning
 vishwa kaa itihaas abhiyantriki ke romance kii kahani se bharaa padaa he
 In India and abroad, visionary and determined people have done important tasks by staking everything in accordance with their dreams
 prayek abhiyantric abhiyaan main tatsambandhi vishesh samasyaayen rahati hai or inako hal karne main choti-badi donon prakaar kii pratibhaaon ko avasar miltaa he
 Engineering is an applied science
 ejiniyari main karypranali kaa mahatv pehle se he kintu ab yah or bhi adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 As a result, 'systems engineering', 'knowledge engineering' etc
 have been born
 mote taur par kisi bhi ejeeniyar ko do baaten samajni hotin hai - Keeping in mind the 'requirements' and restrictions, the engineer prepares specifications, drawings, quality control to manufacture the required goods or services
 praayah ejeeniyar ke paas ek se adhik hal hote hai
 He considers diverse options
 vah vikalpon ko takneekee, aarthik tathaa suraksha kii drushti se moolyankan karata he or jo sarvaadhik upyukt parinaam detaa he use chun liya jaataa he
 Engineer work is very challenging
 galat hal kaa parinaam bahut mahangaa yaa bahut khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why often an engineer tests and analyzes a solution before implementing it
 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem
 Do away
 computer ke aane se ejiniyari kii karypranali main moolbhoot parivartan aa gaya
 Earlier long-term calculations were done to design something, experiments were done, design reviews were done, but now computer simulations are being replaced by them
 'finite elemants methd' ke aagaman se yantriki, dravgatiki, vidyutchumbakatv, mausamavigyaan, ooshmaa-gatiki aadi ke kathin se kathin simulation kiye jane lage hai
 Computer software is being used for designing circuits, layouts of circuits, testing of circuits, etc
 sanseksh main kahen to computor kaa prayog dizin main, drafting, pareekshan main, nirmaan main or rakrakhaav main - sab jagah hone laga he
 In addition, the engineer gets help from the computer at every step - in design, production and in improving the equipment
 dizin main computer ke upyog se kaary shighrata se puraa ho jaataa he
 In many cases nowadays, modeling by computer can relieve the creation of expensive prototypes
 computor software main aajkal pehle se nirmit takneekee halon kaa database bhi uplabdh he
 Now instructions are given to numerically controlled machines, which has greatly simplified the process of production
 ise bhi dekhen - mahapariyojnaon kii suchi Most of the engineering works are huge

 Projects are made to do such engineering works
 vishwavyaapee kaary karne vaali gaiyr-sarkari sansthaayen aapadaaon se ladane ke liye tathaa vikaas ke liye samuchit hal pradaan karne hetu engeeron kii sahaayta letin hai
 Many religious organizations use the engineering directly for the good of mankind
 aisi kuch sansthaayen nimnlikhit hai- In physiology, action potentials are a low-gv phenomenon in which the electrical membrane potential of the cell rapidly rises and falls, following the pattern pattern
 kriya vibhav, kai prakaar kii jantu koshikaon main hoti he, jise uttejneey koshika kaha jaataa he, jisamen shaamil hai neuron, mansapeshi koshika or antahsravi koshika
 In neurons, they play a central role in cell-to-cell communication
 anya prakaar kii koshikaon main, unka mukhya kaary antar-koshikeey prakriyaaon ko sakriy karnaa he
 In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in a series of events that result in contraction
 agnyashay kii beta koshika main, ve insulin ke srav ko prerit karte hai
 The action potential in neurons is also known as "nerve impulse" or "spikes" and the temporal sequence of the action potential generated by a neuron is called its "spike train"
 ek neuron jo ek acshan potenshial utsarjan karata he use aksar "fire" karata hua kaha jaataa he
 The action potential is generated by a special type of voltage-gated ion channel embedded in the cell's plasma membrane
 in channelon ko tab band kar diya jaataa he jab jhilli kshamta, koshika kii vishram kshamta ke kareeb hoti he, lekin ve teji se khulanaa shuru ho jate hai jab yadi jhilli kshamta sateek rup se paribhaashit aarambhik mulya tak bad jaati he
 When the channels open, they allow the arrival of sodium ions, which increase the flow of an inward current in the membrane potential, which changes the electrochemical gradient, which in turn further increases the membrane potential
 is kriya ke parinamswaroop or adhik channel khulte hai, jo or adhik vidyut dhara kaa utpaadan karte hai or isi tarah aage hota rahata he
 This process continues explosively until all available ion channels open, resulting in a huge jump in membrane potential
 sodium yanon kii teevr aamad, plasma jhilli kii dhruvabhisarita ko palat detii he or uske baad aayan channel tezi se niskriy ho jate hai
 When sodium channels are closed, sodium ions can no longer enter the neuron and they are actively transported to the plasma membrane
 potacium channel tab sakriy ho jate hai or vahaan potacium yanon kii ek bahya dhara hoti he, jo vidyut-rasinic pravanta ko vishram sthiti main waapas laati he
 After an action potential occurs, there is a transient negative shift, called afterhyperpolarization or refractory period due to excess potassium currents
 yahi vah kriyavali he jo ek acshan potenshial ko us tareeke se waapas yatra karne se rokatii he jis tareeke se vah aayaa hota he
 In animal cells, there are two main types of action potentials, the first type produced by voltage-gated sodium channels and the second type by voltage-gated calcium channels
 Sodium-based action potentials typically last less than a millisecond, while calcium-based action potentials can last up to 100 milliseconds or longer
 kuch prakaar ke neurons main, dhime calcium spike, tezi se utsarjit sodium spike ke lambe visphot ke liye prerana shakti pradaan karte hai
 In heart muscle cells, on the other hand, an initial rapid sodium spike provides a "primer" to provoke the rapid onset of a calcium spike, which then induces muscle contraction
 pashu sharir ke utakon main sabhi koshikaayen vidyutiya rup se dhruviya hoti hai - duusare shabdon main, ve koshika kii plasma jhilli ke chaaron ore ek voltage bhinnata banaae rakhti hai, jise jhilli kshamta ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This electrical polarization results from complex interactions between the protein structures embedded in the membrane called ion pumps and ion channels
 neurons main, jhilli main aayan channelon ke prakaar aamtaur par, koshika ke vibhinn bhaagon main alag-alag hote hai, jo dendrit, akshatantu or koshika sharir ko vibhinn vidyutiya gun pradaan karte hai
 As a result, parts of the neuron's membrane may be excitable, while others are not
 neuron kaa sabase uttejneey hissaa aamtaur par akshatantu pahari he, lekin akshatantu or koshika sharir bhi adhikansh maamalon main uttejneey hote hai
 Each excitable patch of membrane has two critical levels of membrane potential: the resting potential, which is the value that the membrane potential maintains until something is disturbed to the cell, and a higher value called the initial potential
 ek vishisht neuron ke akshatantu pahari par, vishram kshamta -70 milivolt ke aasapaas hoti he or aarambhik kshamta -55 mv ke aasapaas hoti he
 Synaptic input to a neuron causes the membrane to be depolarized or hyperpolarized; That is, they cause the membrane potential to increase or decrease
 acshan potenshial tab chaalu hota he jab jhilli kshamta ko seemaa tak laane ke liye paryaapt vidhruvan jamaa ho jaataa he
 When an action potential is in motion, the membrane potential suddenly rises upward, often reaching +100 mv and then uniformly dropping back down, often ending below the relaxation level, where it Lasts for a period of time
 acshan potenshial kaa aakaar roodhibaddh he; arthath, ek di gai koshika main sabhi acshan potenshial ke liye vruddhi or giravat kaa aayam or samyavadhi, aamtaur par lagbhag samaan hoti he
 In most neurons, the entire process occurs in the thousandth of a second
 neurons ke kai rup, prati second 10-100 tak kii daron se lagaataar acshan potenshial utsarjit karte rahete hai; kuch prakaar, haalanki shant hote hai or bina kisi acshan potenshial ke utsarjan ke ek minute yaa zyada samay tak chal sakate hai
 At the biophysical level, action potentials result from special types of voltage-gated ion channels
 jhilli kshamta ke badhane ke saath, sodium aayan channel khulata he, jo sodium yanon ko koshika main pravishti kii anumati detaa he
 This then opens potassium ion channels that allow potassium ions to exit the cell
 sodium yanon kaa andar kii ore pravaah, koshika main dhanatmak rup se charge dhanayan ke sankendran ko badha detaa he or vidhruvan ko prerit karata he, jahaan koshika kii kshamta, koshika kii vishram kshamta se adhik hoti he
 Sodium channels close at the peak of the action potential, while potassium continues to leave the cell
 potacium yanon kii samaapti, jhilli kshamta ko kam kar detii he yaa koshika ko ati-dhruviya kar detii he
 For short voltage increases from rest, the potassium current exceeds the sodium current and the voltage returns to its normal resting value, typically −70 mv
 However, if the voltage exceeds a critical limit, typically 15 mv above the relaxation value, the sodium current dominates
 yah ek sahaj sthiti ko falit karata he jahaan sodium dhara se aane vaali dhanatmak pratikriya or adhik sodium channel ko sakriy karti he
 Thus, that cell "fires", producing an action potential
 ek acshan potenshial ke kram main voltage-gated channel ke khulne se utpaadit hone vaali dharaaen aam taur par mahatvapurn rup se praarambhik uttejk dhaaraon se badi hoti hai
 Thus the amplitude, duration, and size of the action potential are largely determined by the properties of the excitable membrane and not by the amplitude or duration of the excitation
 This all-and-nothing property of the action potential sets it apart from the gradual potential such as receptor potential, electrotonic potential, and synaptic potential, which increase with the intensity of excitation
 vibhinn koshika prakaar or koshika khaanon main acshan potenshial ke naanaa prakaar maujuud hote hai, jo voltage-gated channelon ke prakaar, risaav channel, channel vitaran, aayan sankendran, jhilli sandharitra, taapmaana or anya karkon dwaara nirdhaarit hote hai
 The main ions involved in action potentials are sodium and potassium cation; Sodium ions enter the cell and potassium ions exit and balance is maintained
 membrane voltage ke teevr badlaav ke liye, apekshaakrit kuch yanon ko jhilli ko paar karne kii jarurat hoti he
 Ions exchanged during an action potential, therefore, make a negligible change in the internal and external ion concentrations
 kuch aayan, jo vastav main paar kar jate hai ve sodium-potacium pump kii nirantar kriya dwaara baahar phenk die jate hai, jo anya aayan transporter ke saath sampoorn jhilli main aayan sankendran ke saamaanya anupaat ko banaae rakhata he
 Calcium cation and chloride anion are some of the types of action potentials, for example action potentials in the cardiac action potential and single cell alga, acetabularia, respectively
 haalanki acshan potenshial ko sthaneey str par uttejneey jhilli ke ptch par utpann kiya jaataa hai, falit hone vaali dharaaen, jhilli ke aas-paas ke failaav par acshan potenshial shuru kar sakati hai, jo domino ke samaan prasaran utpann kar sakate hai
 In contrast to passive diffusion of electric potential, action potentials are generated anew near the excitable dispersion of the membrane and propagate without decay
 akshatantu ke melin lepit khand uttejneey nahin hote or ve acshan potenshial utpann nahin karte or sanket, electrotonic potenshial ke rup main niskriy rup se prasaarit hota he
 At regular intervals, unmyelinated patches, called nodes of Ranvier, generate action potentials to amplify the signal
 asthir sanvaahan ke rup main gyaat, is prakaar kaa sanket prasar, sanket veg or akshatantu vyas kaa ek anukool samjhautakaari talmail pradaan karata he
 In general, depolarization of the axon terminal induces the secretion of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft
 iske alaava, pasch-prasaran acshan potenshial ko pyramida neurons ke dendrite main darj kiya gaya he, jo niocortex main sarvatra hai
 They are believed to have a role in spike-timing-dependent plasticity
 jaivik jeevon ke bheetar vidyut sanket, saamanytah, aayan dwaara sanchalit hote hai
 The most important cations for action potentials are sodium and potassium
 donon hi monovailint fatayan hai, jo ek ekal dhanatmak charge vahan karte hai
 The action potential may also include calcium, a divalent cation that carries a double positive charge
 chloride anayan kuch shaiwal ke acshan potenshial main ek badi bhoomika nibhaataa he, lekin adhikansh jaanwaron ke acshan potenshial main ek naganya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The ions cross the cell membrane under two effects: diffusion and electric field
 a simple example in which two mergers — a and b — are separated by a porous barrier interprets that diffusion will ensure that they will eventually blend into the same merge
 This mixture occurs because of differences in their concentrations
 ucch sankendran vaala kshetra, nimna sankendran vaale kshetra kii ore visarit ho jaayegaa
 udhaaharan kaa vistaar karne ke liye, maan lete hai ki vilay a main 30 sodium aayan or 30 chloride aayan hai
 In addition, assume that merger b has only 20 sodium ions and 20 chloride ions
 yah maan kar ki baadha, donon prakaar ke yanon ko guzarane detii he, tab ek sthir sthiti par pahunchaa jaataa he jahaan donon vilay ke paas 25 sodium aayan or 25 chloride aayan hote hai
 However, if the porous barrier is selective on which ions are allowed to pass, diffusion alone will not determine the resulting merger
 pichley udhaaharan par lautate hue, ek aisi baadha banaate hai jo keval sodium yanon dwaara pargamya hai
 Since solution b has a low concentration of both sodium and chloride, that barrier will attract both ions from the solution
 haalanki, keval sodium baadha ke madhyam se yatra karenge
 This would result in an accumulation of sodium in solution B
 chunki sodium main ek dhanatmak charge he, yah sanchay vilay b ko vilay a kii apeksha adhik dhanatmak banayega
 dhanatmak sodium aayan ke, ab adhik-dhanatmak ban chuke vilay b tak yatra karne kii sambhaavna kam hogi
 This creates another factor that controls ion flow, ie the electric field
 The point where this electric field completely opposes the force due to diffusion is called equilibrium potential
 is bindu par, is vishisht aayan kaa shuddh pravaah shunya he
 Each neuron is wrapped in a cell membrane composed of a phospholipid bilayer
 yah jhilli aayan ke liye lagbhag abhedya hoti he
 To transfer ions outside and inside the neuron, the membrane provides two structures
 aayan pump, yanon ko lagaataar andar or baahar karne ke liye koshika kii urja kaa upyog karte hai
 They create the concentration difference by sending the ions against their concentration gradient
 aayan channel tab is sankendran bhinnata kaa upyog aayanon ko apane sankendran pravanta ke neeche bhejne ke liye karte hai 
 However, unlike continuous transport by ion pumps, transport by ion channels is discrete
 ve sirf apane parivesh ke sanketon kii pratikriya main khulte or band hote hai
 This transport of ions through ion channels then changes the voltage of the cell membrane
 yahi parivartan hai jo ek acshan potenshial ko laate hai
 As an analogy, ion pumps play the role of batteries that allow a radio circuit to transmit a signal
 koshika jhilli us baadha ke rup main kaary karti he jo andar ke vilay ko baahar ke vilay se mishrit hone se rokatii he
 These two mergers have different concentrations of their ions
 iske alaava, sankendran main yah antar, vilay ke charge main bhinnata ko falit karata he
 This creates a situation where one merger is more positive than another
 isliye, dhanatmak aayan, rinatmak vilay kii disha main khinchne lagate hai
 Similarly, negative ions begin to pull in the direction of positive fusion
 is gun ke maapan ke liye, ek vyakti kisi bhi tarah is saapeksh dhanaatmakataa ko pakadana chahega
 yah karne ke liye, baahar ke vilay ko shunya voltage ke rup main set kiya jaataa he
 The difference between the inside voltage and the zero voltage is then determined
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi bahari voltage 100 mv he or andruni voltage 30 mv he, to antar -70 mv he
 This is the difference that is commonly referred to as the membrane potential
 aayan channel, abhinn jhilli protein hote hai jisamen ek chhed hota he jisamen se aayan, bahya koshikeey sthaan or aantarik koshika ke bich yatra kar sakate hai
 Most channels are specific to an ion; For example, most potassium channels are characterized by a 1000: 1 selectivity ratio for potassium compared to sodium, although potassium and sodium ions have the same charge and they differ only slightly in their radius
 channel chhidr aam taur par itnaa chota hota he ki yanon ko isamen se ekal-fil kram ke anusaar guzarana aavashyak hota he
 Channel channels for ion passage can be either open or closed, although many channels exhibit different sub conductivity levels
 jab ek channel khulaa hota he, to aayan, us vishesh aayan ke liye channel chhidr ke madhyam se neeche transamembrane sankendran pravanta main ghus jate hai
 The ion flow rate through the channel, that is, the single-channel current amplitude, is determined by the maximum channel conductivity and the electrochemical induction force for that ion, which is the difference between the instantaneous value of the membrane potential and the value of the inverse potential 
 acshan potenshial, vibhinn samay par khulte or band hote vibhinn aayan channelon kaa prakatikaran he
 a channel can have many different states, but each such state is either closed or open
 In general, the closed state would correspond either to a contraction of the pore - making it impassable to the ion - or to a different part of the protein, blocking the pore
 For example, a voltage-dependent sodium channel undergoes inactivation, in which a portion of the protein slides into the pore and closes
 yah niskriyata, sodium dharaa ko band kar detii he or acshan potenshial main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Ion channels can be classified based on how they react against their surroundings
 udhaaharan ke liye, acshan potenshial main shaamil aayan channel hai voltage-sensitive channel ; ve sampoorn jhilli main voltage ke khilaaf pratikriya main khulte or band hote hai
 Ligand-gated channels form another important class; These ion channels open and close in response to ligand molecule binding, such as neurotransmitters
 Other ion channels open and close with mechanical forces
 abhi bhi anya aayan channel - jaise ki samvedi neuron vaale - anya uddipano ke khilaaf pratikriya main khulte or band hote hai, jaise prakaash, taapmaana yaa dabaav
 The ionic current of the action potential flows throughout the cell membrane in response to the ion's concentration variation
 ye sankendran bhinnataayen aayan panpon dwaara sthapit kii jaati hai, jo abhinn jhilli protein hai jo sakriy parivahan sanchalit karti hai, arthath aayan ko unke sankendran pravanta ke khilaaf pump karne ke liye koshikeey urja kaa upyog karti hai
 Such ion pumps take ions from one side of the membrane and release them to the other side
 acshan potenshial ke liye sabase adhik praasangik aayan pump he sodium-potacium pump, jo koshika se teen sodium yanon ko baahar karata he do potacium yanon ko andar karata he
 As a result, the concentration of potassium ions k + inside the neuron is roughly 20 times greater than that of the outside concentration, while the external sodium concentration is about nine times larger than the inside
 thik isi tareeke se, anya yanon main neuron ke andar or baahar bhinn sankendran hota he, jaise calcium, chloride or magnesium
 Ion pumps only affect action potentials by establishing relative ratios of intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations
 acshan potenshial main mukhya rup se aayan channelon kaa, na ki aayan panpon kaa khulanaa or band hona shaamil hota he
 If the ion pumps are switched off to remove their energy source, or a barrier like Waben is added, even in that case, the axon can fire hundreds of thousands of action potentials before their amplitude rapidly decays
 vishesh rup se, aayan pump, ek acshan potenshial ke baad jhilli ke punah dhruvikaran main koi mahatvapurn bhoomika nahin nibhaate
 As described in the ion and force sections that induce their motion, the equilibrium or reversal potential of an ion is the value of the transmembrane voltage at which the electric force generated by the ion's diffusion activity, the molecular force of that diffusion below its concentration gradient
 Become equal to
 kisi bhi aayan ke liye santulan kshamta ko narnst sameekaran kaa upyog karte hue pariklit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the rebound potential for potassium ions would be as follows jahaan: Even if two different ions have the same charge, they may still have completely different equilibrium capacities, provided that their outside and / or outside configurations are different from their and / or inside
 For example, the balance of potassium and sodium in neurons
 Potassium equilibrium potential is e k, -84 mv with 5 mmol / l potassium outside and 140 mmol / l inside
 duusari ore, sodium santulan kshamta e Na lagbhag +40 mv he jahaan 1-2 mmol / l sodium andar or 120 mmol / l baahar he
 However, there is an equilibrium membrane potential e m at which the net current of all ions across the entire membrane is zero
 is kshamta kii gananaa goldman sameekaran ke dwaara kii jaati he
 In short, this is the Nernst equation, in the sense that it is based on the charge of the ion in question, as well as on the difference between the external and internal concentrations
 However, it also considers the relative permeability of the plasma membrane for each ion in question
 acshan potenshial ke sabase mahatvapurn teen monovailint aayan ke liye: potacium, sodium or chloride 
 Being an anion, the chloride positions are treated differently from the cations; The inner concentration is the fraction, and the outside concentration is denominator, which is the reverse of the Fatian words
 p i, i prakaar ke aayan ke pargamyata ke liye he
 If calcium ions are also considered, which are important for the action potential in the muscle, the formula for equilibrium capacity becomes more complex
 vishram jhilli kshamta kii utpatti ko spasht rup se goldman sameekaran dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The resting plasma membrane of most animal cells is more permeable to k +, which makes the resting potential v rest closer to the potassium equilibrium potential
 yah jaananaa mahatvapurn he ki shuddh lipid dwiparat kii ynic or jal pargamyata bahut nune he or yah samaan tareeke se, tulaneey aakaar kaa yanon ke liye naganya hai, jaise Na+ K+
 Cell membranes, however, hold a large number of ion channels, water channels, and various ionic pumps, exchangers and transporters that dramatically and selectively increase the permeability of membranes to various ions
 vishram kshamta par potacium aayan ke liye apekshaakrit ucch jhilli pargamyata, andruni-sanshodhak potashium aayan channel se falit hoti he, jo rinatmak voltage par khuli hoti he, tathakthith li potacium conductances jaise mukt sanshodhak K+ channel jo khuli sthiti main band kiye gaye hote hai
 These potassium channels should be considered different from the voltage-activated k + that are responsible for membrane repolarization during the action potential
 kai prakaar kii koshikaayen acshan potenshial kaa samarthan karti hai, jaisai paudh koshika, mansapeshi koshika or hriday kii vishesh koshikaayen 
 However, the main excitatory cell is the neuron, which also has the easiest mechanism for action potentials
 neurons, vidyutiya rup se uttejneey koshika hai jo akshatantu adhik saamaanya, ke ek yaa ek se adhik dendrit, ek ekal soma, ek ekal akshatantu or ek yaa adhik akshatantu terminlon se bana hota he
 The dendrite is one of two types of synapses, the second type being the axon terminal bottons
 dendrite, akshatantu terminal botans ke pratikriya main utkshepan kaa gathan karte hai
 These protrusions, or colic, are designed to capture neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron
 unamem ligand dwaara sakriy channel kaa ek ucch sankendran hota he
 Therefore this is where synapses from two neurons communicate with each other
 in shulon main ek patali gardan hoti he jo ek balbanuma utkshepan ko mukhya dendrite se jodatii he
 This ensures that the changes taking place inside the spine are less likely to affect the surrounding spine
 isliye durlabh apwaad ke saath dendrite ke samaan ridh, ek swatantra ikai ke rup main kaary karti he
 Deandrite then joins Soma
 soma, kendrak ko dhaaran karata he, jo neuron ke liye niamak ke rup main kaam karata he
 Unlike the spine, the surface of the soma permeates ion channels activated by voltage
 ye channel, dendrite dwaara utpann sanketon ko sanchaarit karne main madad karte hai
 The axon hillock exits the soma
 yah kshetra, voltage dwaara sakriy sodium channel ke ek avishwasaneey ucch sankendran dhaaran karne se charitaarth hota he
 In general, it is considered a spike start region for the action potential
 ridh par utpann or soma dwaara sancharit ekaadhik sanket, sabhi yahaan abhisarit hote hai
 The axon is the axon immediately after the clitoris
 yah ek patali belanaakaar utkshepan he jo soma se dur yatra karti he
 This axon is separated by a myelin shell
 melin, shwaan koshika se bana he jo akshatantu khand ke ird-gird kai baar khud ko lapetati he
 This creates a thick layer of fat that prevents ions from entering or escaping into the axon
 yah algaav donon kaary karata he, mahatvapurn sanket kshay ko roktaa he or saath hi saath teevr sanket gati ko sunishchit karata he
 However, this separation has the restriction that no channel can be present on the surface of the axon
 isliye, jhilli ke niyamit dhabbe hai, jinamein koi algaav nahin he
 The nodes of these Ranvier can be considered as 'small axon hill' because they aim to amplify the signal to prevent excessive signal decay
 antim chor par, akshatantu apane rodhan ko kho detaa he or kai akshatantu terminlon main failane lagata he
 These axon terminals then terminate for the formation of another class of synapses, the axon terminal button
 in batan main voltage dwaara sakriy calcium channel hote hai, jo anya neurons ko sanket dene ke samay bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Before considering the propagation of action potentials around the axon and termination in the synaptic knob, it is worth considering the means by which the action potential can be initiated on the axon hillock
 buniyadi aavashyaktaa yah he ki girika par jhilli voltage ko firing ke liye seemaa se upar uthaaya janaa chahie
 There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur
 acshan potenshial, sabase aam rup se priseneptic neuron se uttejk postsyneptic potenshial dwaara shuru kiye jate hai
 Typically, neurotransmitter molecules are released by the presynaptic neuron
 ye tantrikasanchaarak iske baad postsyneptic koshika par receptors se bandha jate he
 This binding opens different types of ion channels
 kholane kii is prakriya ke chalate koshika jhilli kii sthaneey pargamyata main parivartan kaa prabhaav falit hota he or jisase jhilli kshamta main badlaav aata he
 If binding increases the voltage, the synapse is stimulating
 haalanki, agar yah bandhan voltage ko kam kar detaa he to yah nirodhatmak hota he
 As the voltage decreases or increases, this change is passively transmitted to the regions surrounding the membrane
 aamtaur par, voltage uddipan, synapse se dur hote hue or tantrikasanchaarak ke bandhan se samay ke saath ghaatankeey rup se kshay hota he
 Some fraction of the excitation voltage can reach the axon hillock and depolarize the membrane so much that a new action potential is induced
 aam taur par kai synapces kii uttejk kshamta ko ek nae acshan potenshial ko prerit karne ke liye ek hi samay main ek saath kaam karnaa chahie
 Their joint effort can be thwarted by counter-acting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials
 tantrikasancharan vidyutiya synapces ke madhyam se bhi ho saktaa he
 Due to the connection between an excitable cell as a gap junction, an action potential can be transmitted directly from one cell to another
 koshikaon ke bich yanon kaa mukt pravaah, teevr gaiyr-rasinic madhyasthata sancharan ko sakasham banaata he
 Correction channels ensure that the action potentials move in the same direction through an electrical synapse
 maanav tantrika pranali main is prakaar kaa synapse haalanki asaamaanya he
 The amplitude of the action potential is independent of the amount of electricity that produces it
 duusare shabdon main, badi dhara bada acshan potenshial paidaa nahin karti
 isliye acshan potenshial ko ol-or-nan kaha jaataa he, kyonki ve yaa to puri tarah maujuud hote hai yaa bilkul maujuud nahin hote
 iske bajaay, acshan potenshial kii aavriti hi ek uddipan kii tivrata ke liye kutit karata he
 This is in contrast to the receptor potential whose amplitude is dependent on the intensity of a stimulus
 samvedi neurons main ek bahari signal jaise dabaav, taapmaana, prakaash yaa dhwani aayan channel ke khulne or band hone ke saath sammilit hota he, jo badale main jhilli or uske voltage kii ynic pargamyata ko kam karata he
 This voltage change can then be excitatory or inhibitory, and in some sensory neurons, their combined effect may depolarize the axon hillock enough to induce action potentials
 maanvon main udhaaharan ke rup main shaamil he olfactory receptor neuron or misnor kanika jo kramshah gandh or sparsh kii bhaavana ke liye mahatvapurn he
 However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; Some do not even have an axon! Instead, they can convert the signal to release a neurotransmitter or into a continuous gradation potential, either of which can induce the latter neuron to fire an action potential
 udhaaharan ke liye, maanav kaan main, kesh koshika ke anu, aavak dhwani ko yantric rup se chaalit aayan channel ke khulne or band hone main parivartit karte hai, jo tantrikasanchaarak anu ke jari hone kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 In a similar manner, in the human retina, the initial photoreceptor cell and the next two layers of the cell do not produce action potentials; Only a few amacrine cells and a third layer, ganglion cells, produce action potentials that travel to the optic nerve
 samvedi neurons main, acshan potenshial ek bahya prerana se falit hote hai
 However, some excitable cells need no such motivation to fire: they depolarize their axon hillock automatically and fire an internal lock-like action potential at a regular rate
 aisi koshikaon ke voltage nishaan ko pesamekar potenshial ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The cardiac pacemaker cell of the sinoatrial node in the heart provides a good example
 haalanki aise pesamekar potenshial main ek prakritik lay hoti he, ise bahari prerak dwaara samyojit kiya ja saktaa he; udhaaharan ke liye, hriday dar ko pharmaceuticals dwaara badla ja saktaa he or saath hi saath chimpethetic or parachimpethetic tantrikaon ke sanketon se bhi
 bahya prerak, koshika kii doharaawadaar firing ko parinamit nahin karte balki keval uske samay ko badal dete hai
 In some cases, regulation of frequencies can be more complex, revealing patterns of action potentials, such as bursting
 acshan potenshial ke path ko paanch bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: vikaas charan, charam charan, patan charan, anderlaut charan or ant main du:saadhy avadhi
 vikaas charan main jhilli kshamta vidhruvit hoti he 
 The point at which depolarization stops is called the peak phase
 is str par, jhilli kshamta adhiktam ho jaati he
 After this, a decline phase occurs
 is charan main jhilli kshamta ucch vidhruvit hoti he 
 The undershoot phase is the point during which the membrane potential becomes temporarily more negatively charged than the resting time
 ant main, vah samay jiske dauraan ek baad ke acshan potenshial ko fire karnaa asambhav yaa mushkil ho jaataa he use du:saadhy avadhi kaha jaataa he, jo anya charnon ke saath ativyapt ho saktaa he
 The path of the action potential is determined by two coupled effects
 voltage ke prati samvedansheel pratham aayan channel, jhilli voltage v m main hone vaale parivartan kii pratikriya main khulte or band hote hai
 This changes the membrane's permeability to those ions
 doosraa, goldman sameekaran ke anusaar, pargamyata main yah parivartan santulan kshamta e m main badal jaataa he or is prakaar, jhilli voltage v m main
 is prakaar, jhilli kshamta, pargamyata ko prabhavit karti he, jo phir aage kii jhilli kshamta ko prabhavit karata he
 This determines the probability of positive feedback, which is a key part of the development phase of the action potential
 ek jatil pahalu yah he ki ek ekal aayan channel main bahu aantarik "get" ho sakate hai jo vipareet tareekon se v m main parivartan kii pratikriya karte hai
 For example, although increasing v m opens most of the gates in the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, it also closes the channel's inactivity gate, although slightly slower
 isliye, jab Vm ko achaanak uthaaya jaataa he, to sodium channel shuru main khul jate hai, lekin phir dhimi niskriyata ke kaaran band ho jate hai
 The voltages and current of the action potential were accurately depicted in all its phases in 1952 by Alan Lloyd Hodgein and Andrew Huxley, for which he was awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
 haalanki, unka model keval do prakaar ke voltage samvedansheel aayan channelon par vichaar karata he or unke bare main kai dharanaen banaata he, jaise ki unke aantarik dwaar ek duusare se swatantra rup main khulte or band hote hai
 In reality, there are many types of ion channels, and they do not always open and close independently of each other
 ek theth acshan potenshial, ek paryaapt majboot vidhruvan ke saath akshatantu girika par shuru hoti he, jaise ek prerak jo bad jaataa he
 This depolarization is often caused by injection of excess sodium cation into the cell; These cations can come from a wide variety of sources, such as chemical synapses, sensory neurons, or pacemaker potentials
 potacium ke liye praarambhik jhilli pargamyata kam hoti he, lekin anya yanon se adhik hoti he, jo resting potenshial ko e K≈-75 mv ke nazadik bana detii he
 This depolarization opens both sodium and potassium channels in the membrane and allows ions to flow in and out of the axon, respectively
 agar vidhruvan chota he baahar jaati potacium dhara aavak sodium dharaa ko abhibhoot kar detii he or jhilli apane saamaanya resting potenshial, -70 mv ke aasapaas vidhruvit ho jaati he
 However, if the depolarization is large enough, the inward sodium current exceeds the outgoing potassium current and a fugitive state arises: the greater the incoming current, the more v m increases, which in turn increases the inward current and Increases more
 ek paryaapt majboot vidhruvan voltage ke prati samvedansheel sodium channelon ko kholta he; sodium ke prati badhati pargamyata v m ko sodium santulan voltage e Na≈ +55 mv ke kareeb le jaati he
 The increasing voltage in turn opens more sodium channels, which pushes v m more towards e Na
 yah dhanatmak pratikriya tab tak jari rahati he jab tak ki sodium channel puri tarah nahin khulte hai or v m, ena ke nazadik nahin ho jaataa
 v m or sodium pargamyata main tej vruddhi acshan potenshial ke vikaas charan ke anuroop hoti he
 The critical threshold voltage for this acute condition is usually around −45 mv, but it depends on the recent activity of the axon
 ek jhilli jisane abhi-abhi ek acshan potenshial fire kiya he vah turant doosraa fire nahin kar sakati, kyonki aayan channel apni saamaanya sthiti main waapas nahin aae hote hai
 The period during which no new action potential can be fired is called absolute refractory period
 lambe samay main, kuch aayan channelon ke punarsthapit ho jane ke baad, akshatantu ko anya acshan potenshial utpaadan ke liye prerit kiya ja saktaa he, lekin keval ek bahut majboot vidhruvan ke saath, jaise, -30 mv
 vah avadhi jiske dauraan acshan potenshial ko prerit karnaa asaamaanya rup se kathin hota he use relative refractory piriad kaha jaataa he
 The positive feedback of the growth phase slows down and stops when the sodium ion channels open to the maximum
 acshan potenshial ke charam par, sodium pargamyata adhiktam hoti he or jhilli voltage v m, sodium santulan voltage e Na ke lagbhag baraabar hota he
 However, the same increased voltage that initially opened the sodium channel causes them to slowly close, closing their knuckles; The sodium channels become inactive
 isse sodium ke liye jhilli kii pargamyata kam ho jaati he, jo jhilli voltage waapas neeche kar detii he
 At the same time, the increased voltage opens the voltage-sensitive potassium channel; An increase in the potassium permeability of the membrane leads v m to EK
 sanyukt rup se, sodium or potacium pargamyata main in parivartanon ke kaaran Vm tezi se neeche gir jaataa he or jhilli ko punardhruvit karata he or acshan potenshial ke "patan charan" ko utpann karata he
 The increased voltage opened many more potassium channels than normal and some of these did not immediately close when the membrane returned to its normal resting voltage
 iske alaava, acshan potenshial ke dauraan, calcium yanon ke pravaah kii pratikriya main anya potacium channel khul gaye
 The potassium permeability of the membrane is momentarily abnormally high, bringing the membrane voltage v m closer to the potassium equilibrium voltage EK
 isliye, vahaan ek anderlaut yaa ucchdhruvikaran hota he, jise takneekee bhashaa main afterhyperpolaraizeshan kaha jaataa he, jo tab tak chalata he jab tak ki jhilli kii potacium pargamyata apane saamaanya mulya par nahin aa jaati
 Each action potential is followed by a refractory period, divided into absolute refractory periods, during which it is impossible to induce another action potential, and relative refractory periods, during which a normal-to-strong effector is required
 can be done
 ye do du:saadhy avadhiyaan, sodium or potacium channel anuon kii sthiti main parivartan ke kaaran hoti hai
 Sodium channels, when closed after the action potential, enter an "inactive" state, in which they cannot be opened despite the membrane potential - this leads to an absolute refractory period
 sodium channel kii ek paryaapt sankhya ke apane vishram sthiti main parivartan ke baad bhi, aisa aksar hota he ki potacium channelon kaa ek ansh khulaa rahata he, jisase jhilli potenshial ke liye vidhruvan mushkil hota he or isse saapeksh du:saadhy avadhi kii utpatti hoti he
 Because the density and subtype of potassium channels can vary between different types of neurons, the relative refractory period is highly unstable
 nirpeksh du:saadhy avadhi, akshatantu ke ird-gird acshan potenshial ke dishaheen prasar ke liye kaaphi had tak jimmedaar he
 At any given time, the patch of axon behind the actively occluded portion is refractory, but the front patch is capable of being depolarized from the action potential due to not being activated recently
 akshatantu girika par janit acshan potenshial akshatantu par ek lahar ke rup main failata he
 During an action potential, currents flowing inward at a point on the axon spread to the axon and depolarize adjacent sections of its membrane
 yadi paryaapt majboot he, to yah vidhruvan padosi jhilli ptch main ek samaan acshan potenshial prerit karata he
 This basic system was demonstrated in 1937 by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin
 tantrika khando ko kuchalane yaa thanda karne or is prakaar acshan potenshial ko block karne ke baad, unhone dikhaaya ki khand ke ek taraf pahunchane vaala acshan potenshial duusari taraf ek anya acshan potenshial ko ubhaar saktaa tha, basharte ki avarodhit khand paryaapt rup se chota ho
 Once an action potential occurs on a patch of membrane, the membrane patch needs to be repaired to re-fire
 aanvik str par, yah nirpeksh duhasaadhay avadhi us samay ke anuroop hoti he jo voltage-sakriy sodium channel ko niskriyata se thik hone main lagati he, yani apane band rup main lautne main
 neurons main voltage-sakriy potacium channelon ke kai prakaar hai, unamem se kai teji se niskriy hote hai or unamem se kuch dhire-dhire niskriy hote hai yaa niskriy hote hi nahin; yah parivartanshiltaa is baat kii guarantee detii he ki punahdhruvan ke liye vahaan hameshaa curent kaa ek uplabdh strot hoga, tab bhi jab purvavarti vidhruvan kii vajah se potacium channel niskriy hai
 All neuronal voltage-activated sodium channels, on the other hand, become inactive within several milliseconds during strong depolarization, thus making the next depolarization impossible until a significant fraction of the sodium channel returns to its closed state
 
 Although, this limits the firing range, the absolute refractory period ensures that the action potential moves in only one direction, bounded by an axon
 The current flowing inside due to an action potential propagates in both directions around the axon
 haalanki, akshatantu kaa keval bina fire vaala bhaag, ek acshan potenshial ke saath pratikriya kar saktaa he; vah hissaa jisane abhi-abhi fire kiya he vah tab tak niskriy hota he jab tak ki acshan potenshial surakshit rup se seemaa se baahar nahin ho jaataa or us hisse ko punah uttejit nahin karata
 saamaanya orthodromik chaalan main acshan potenshial akshatantu girika se syneptic naub kii ore prasaarit hota he; vipareet disha main prasar - jise antidromik chaalan ke rup main janaa jaataa he - atyant durlabh he
 However, if a labial axon is induced in its middle, both parts of the axon are "fresh", that is, without fire; Two action potentials are then generated, one of which travels towards the axon hillock and the other travels in the direction of the synaptic knob
 tantrika tantra main vidyut sanketon ke teevr or asarkaari trncedakson kii vikasvaadi jarurat ne neuronal akshatantu ke aasapaas melin shith kii upasthiti ko parinamit kiya
 Myelin is a multi-lamellar membrane that wraps the axons in areas separated by gaps called nodes of renvir, that are generated by specialized cells, Schwann cells, especially in the peripheral nervous system and especially in the central nervous system
 By oligodendrosite
 The myelin sheath reduces membrane potential in the inter-node gap and increases membrane resistance and thus allows a rapid, dramatic activity of action potentials from one node to another
 melin kriya mukhya rup se ridhwale praaniyon main pai jaati he, lekin bina ridh vaale praaniyon main se kuch main ek anuroop pranali pai gai he, jaise chinraat prajatiyon main se kuch main

 ridh vaale praani main sabhi neurons melinkrut nahin hote; udhaaharan ke liye, swytt tantrika tantra vaale neurons ke akshatantu, saamaanya rup main melinkrut nahin hote
 Myelin prevents ions from entering or coming from axons in myelinated areas
 ek saamaanya niyam ke rup main, melin kriya acshan potenshial ke chaalan gati ko badha detaa he or unhen or adhik urja kushal banaata he
 Whether or not bumpy, the average conduction speed of an action potential ranges from 1 m / s to over 100 m / s and is generally higher than the axial diameter
 acshan potenshial jhilli ke madhyam se akshatantu ke melinkrut kshetron main prasar nahin kar sakate hai
 However, the current is carried by the cytoplasm, enough to depolarize the next 1 or 2 nodes of Ranvier
 iske bajaay, ek acshan potenshial se ek node of renviar par ynic curent ek duusare acshan potenshial ko agle node par bhadakaati he; ek node se duusare node par acshan potenshial kii yah spasht kud, naatakeey chaalan kehalaati he
 Although the mechanism of theatrical conduction was suggested by Ralph Lilly in 1925, the first experimental evidence of theatrical conduction was presented by Tasaki Ichiji and Taiji Takeuchi and by Andrew Huxley and Robert Stemfli
 By contrast, in the unmyelinated axons, the action potential instigates another in the right adjacent membrane and moves continuously down the axon like a wave
 melin main do mahatvapurn laabh he: tej chaalan gati or urja kshamta
 nunatam vyas se bade akshatantu ke liye, melinkriya, acshan potenshial ke chaalan veg ko aam taur par das guna badha detii he
 Conversely, for a given conduction velocity, myelinated fibers are smaller than their unmyelinated counterparts
 udhaaharan ke liye, acshan potenshial ek melinkrut frog akshatantu main or ek bina melinkrut vishaal squid akshatantu main mote taur par usee gati se chalate hai, lekin frog akshatantu kaa lagbhag 30 guna chota vyas hota he or 1000 guna chota paar-anubhageeya kshetra hota he
 Furthermore, since ionic currents are limited in nodes of rainwear, very little ions "leak" across the membrane, saving metabolic energy
 yah bachat ek mahatvapurn chaynaatmak laabh he, kyonki maanav tantrika tantra sharir kii chayapachay urja kaa 20% kaa upyog karata he
 The length of myelinated segments of the axon is critical to the success of the dramatic conduction
 chaalan kii gati ko adhiktam karne ke liye unhen jitna sambhav ho sake lanbaa hona chahie, lekin itnaa lambaa nahin hona chahie ki aane vaala sanket itnaa kamazor ho ki vah agle node of renviar par ek acshan potenshial ko utpann karne main asamarth ho
 In nature, the myelinated region is typically enough for a passively transmitted signal to travel to at least two nodes and maintain sufficient amplitude to fire an action potential at the second or third node
 is prakaar, naatakeey pravaahakatva kaa suraksha kaarak ucch he, jo chot ke maamle main prasaaran ko node ko bypass karne kii anumati detaa he
 Action potentials, however, may be prematurely depleted in some places where the safety factor is low, even in unmyelinated neurons; a common example is the splitting point of an axon where it splits into two axons
 kuch bimaariyaan melin ko karaab kar detii hai or naatakeey pravaahakatva ko ksheen kar detii hai or acshan potenshial ke pravaah veg ko kam kar detii hai
 The best known form of this is multiple sclerosis, in which myelin breakdown disrupts coordinated activities
 ek akshatantu ke bheetar dhaaraon kaa pravaah, cabel siddhant dwaara maatraatmak rup se varnit kiya ja saktaa he or uski vyakhya dwaara, jaise poorak model
 cabel siddhant ko transatlantic telegraph cabel ko swaroopit karne ke liye 1855 main lord kelvin dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha or 1946 main hojkin or rushtone dwaara neurons ke liye praasangik dikhaaya gaya
 In simple cable theory, the neuron is considered to be electrically inert, exactly cylindrical transmission cables, which can be described by a partial differential equation
 jahaan V, t samay or x sthiti main ek neuron kii lambaai ke saath jhilli main vyaapt voltage he or jahaan λ or τ visheshta lambaai or samay he jis par prerak ke liye pratikriya main voltage kshay hota he
 In the context of the above circuit diagram, these scales can be determined by the resistance and capacitor per unit
 in samay or lambaai ko bina melin fibre main neuron ke vyas par chaalan veg kii nirbharta samajhane ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the time scale τ increases with both the membrane resistance rm and capacitance cm
 jaise-jaise dharita badhati he, to ek diye gaye transamembrane voltage ko utpann karne ke liye or adhik charge ko sthanantarit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, 
 In a similar way, if the resistance per unit intrinsic length ri is less than one axon than another, the spatial decay length λ becomes longer and the flow velocity of an action potential should increase
 agar transamembrane pratirodh r m main vruddhi hoti he, to vah sampoorn jhilli main ausat "risaav" ko kam kar detaa he, vaise hi λ ko lambaa kar detaa he, jisase pravaah veg bad jaataa he
 In general, the action potentials that reach the synaptic knob induce a neurotransmitter to be secreted into the synaptic cleft
 neurotransmeter chote anu hai jo postsyneptic koshika main aayan channel ko khol sakate hai, adhikansh akshatantu main unke sabhi termini par samaan tantrikasanchaarak hota he
 The arrival of the action potential causes voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane, with calcium being filled with neurotransmitter vesicles that migrate to the cell surface and release their contents into the synaptic cleft
 is jatil prakriya ko neurotoxin tetanospasmin or botulinum toxin dwaara avarodhan kiya jaataa he jo kramash: tetanus or botulism ke liye jimmedaar hai
 Some synapses remove the neurotransmitter "middleman" and connect the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells
 jab ek acshan potenshial aise synapces tak pahunchataa he, ynic dharaaen jo priseneptic cell main bahati hai ve baadha jhilliyon ke madhyam se paar kar sakate hai or konexin kahe jane vaale poron se postsyneptic kaksh main pravesh kar sakati hai
 Thus, ionic currents of the ability of the presynaptic action potential can directly stimulate the postsynaptic cell
 vidyut synapces tej prasaaran kii anumati dete hai kyonki unhen syneptic cleft main tantrikasanchaarak ke dhime prasar kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Therefore, electrical synapses are used when fast response and timing coordination are important, as in the escape reflex, in the retina and heart of the vertebrate
 rasinic synapse kaa ek vishesh maamla he tantrikapeshiy jod, jisamen ek motor neuron kaa akshatantu peshi fibre par samaapt hota he
 In such cases, the released neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, which binds to the acet choline receptor, an integral membrane protein in the membrane of muscle fibers
 haalanki, asiticholin bandhaa nahin rahata he balki alag ho jaataa he or synapse main sthit injim, asiticholinsterez dwaara hydrolies hota he
 This enzyme quickly reduces muscle stimulation, which allows the level and timing of muscle contraction to be delicately regulated
 is niyantran ko rokane ke liye kuch zehar asiticholinsterez ko niskriy kar dete hai, jaise nerve agent sareen or taboon, or kitnashak diaginon or melathiyaan
 The cardiac action potential differs from a neuronal action potential in the case of an enhanced plateau, in which the membrane is held at a high voltage for a few hundred milliseconds before being repolarized by the potassium current
 yah platu, dhime calcium channel kii vajah se hota he jo sodium channelon ke niskriy hone ke baad bhi santulan potenshial dhaaran kiya jaataa he
 The cardiac action potential plays an important role in the coordination of cardiac contraction
 siinoetrial node kii hriday koshikaayen pesamekar potenshial pradaan karti hai jo hriday ko samakramik karata he
 The action potential of those cells propagates through the atrioventricular node, which is the normal flow path between the atrial and the vortices
 e ve node se ection potenshial, hiss ke madhyam se yatra karata he or phir purkinje fibre jaataa he
 In contrast, anomalies in arrhythmias in the cardiac action potential can cause a congenital malformation, especially in human diagnosis
 Many anti-arrhythmic drugs work on the cardiac action potential, such as quinidine, lidocaine, beta blockers, and verapamil
 ek saamaanya kankal kii mansapeshi koshika main acshan potenshial, neurons main hone vaale acshan potenshial ke samaan he
 Action potentials result from depolarization of the cell membrane, which opens voltage-sensitive sodium channels; They become inactive and the membrane is depolarized from the outward stream of potassium ions
 acshan potenshial se pehle resting potenshial aamtaur par -90mv he, jo vishisht neurons kii tulana main kuch adhik rinatmak he
 The muscle action potential is about 2–4 ms, the absolute duration is about 1–3 ms, and the conduction velocity with the muscle is about 5 m / s
 acshan potenshial, calcium yanon ko jari karata he jo tropomyosin ko mukt karata he or mansapeshiyon ke sankuchan ko anumati detaa he
 The action potential of the muscle is induced by the access of the presynaptic neuronal action potential at the neuromuscular joint, a common target of neurotoxins
 paudhon or fungal koshikaon main bhi vidyutiya rup se uttejnaa hoti he
 The fundamental difference of animal action potentials is that depolarization in plant cells is not accomplished by positive sodium ions but by negative chloride ions

 Electrical and osmotic relationships in plant cells generally indicate a small achievement osmotic, a state of common salinity changes in the unicellular ancestor of plants while the current action of acute signal transmission is observed under animals, a stable metazoa
 in the environment
 It is to be assumed that cells should be ingested, some examples being the action of action potentials in the vascular plant Mimosa pudica, arising independently of excitable metazoa cells
 acshan potenshial, sampoorn bahukoshikeey jeevon main paae jate hai, jisamen shaamil hai paudhe, gaiyr-rishadhari jaise keet or rishadhari jaise sarp or stanpayi

 The size and duration of the resting potential, as well as the action potential, have not varied much with development, although conduction velocity has varied dramatically with melanocrine and axon diameter
 sampoorn vikaas ke dauraan iske sangrakshan ko dekhte hue acshan potenshial vikasvaadi laabh pradaan karne lagata he
 One function of action potentials is rapid, long-term signaling within the organism; The conduction velocity can be greater than 110 m / s, which is one-third of the speed of sound
 koi bhautik vastu puure sharir bhar main utani tezi se sanket nahin de sakati; tulana ke liye, ek hormone anu, mote taur par bade dhamniyon main 8 m / s kii gati se chalata he
 Part of this action is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as contractions of the heart
 ek duusari kriya gananaa he jo isaki peedi ke saath jude he
 Being an all-and-nun signal, not all transmission is lost, any signal that decays has the same advantages as digital electronics for action potentials

 The development of new experimental methods is needed for the study of action potentials
 1955 ke pehle ke praarambhik kaaryon ne teen lakshyon par dhyaan kendrit kiya: ekal neurons yaa akshatantu se sanketon ko alag karnaa, tej, samvedansheel electronics kaa vikaas karnaa or electrode kaa itnaa sankuchan taaki ek ekal koshika ke andar voltage ko record kiya ja sake
 The first problem was solved by the study of neurons axons of the squid genus Loligo
 in akshatantu kaa vyas kaaphi bada hota he or unhen nagn ankhon se dekha ja saktaa he, unhen nikaalane ke liye banane ke liye aasaan he
 The loligo axons, however, are not representative of all excitable cells, and many other systems of action potentials have been studied

 Since the differential transmembrane voltage is proportional to the c time rate of change of Vm, the solution was to design a circuit that kept v m constant, regardless of any current flowing in the membrane
 is prakaar, v m ko sthir rakhane ke liye aavashyak dhara jhilli ke madhyam se behate curent kaa mulya nirdhaarit rakhane ke liye sidhaa pratibimb he
 Other electronic advances include high voltage input with high-impedance electronics and Faraday cages, so the measurement itself does not affect the measured voltage

 As a refinement of this method, a fabrication capable of fixing suggests that the tip of the electrode that is 100 Å, giving high impedance input, should be used

 Optical imaging technology has been developed in recent years to measure action potentials, whether by ultra-special resolution or via synchronous multisite recording
 The action potential has been optically performed using a voltage-sensitive dye, which is recorded from a small patch such a cardiomyocyte membrane
 kai neurotoxin, prakritik or synthetic, donon ko acshan potenshial ko rokane ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 Tetrodotoxin from pufferfish and goniolox from sextetoxin block the action potential, similarly drendrotoxin from the black african snake blocks the voltage-sensitive potassium channel

 The role of electricity in the nervous system of animals was first identified in dissected frogs by Luigi Galvani, who studied it from 1791–1797

 Scientists of the 19th century studied the spread of electrical signals in the nerve and demonstrated that the cell was built above the neural tissue, rather than a network of connected networks in one of the tubes that describes the action potential by four simple differential equations
 haalanki hojkin-huxley model yathartwaadee tantrika membrane kaa ek sarleekaran ho saktaa he kyonki yah prakruti main maujuud he, isaki jatilta ko prerit kiya he bhi kai or adhik model sarlikrut model hai, jaise morris-lekaar or fitzhew-nagumo model, jinamein se donon main keval do yugmit odes hai
 The properties of the Hodgkin – Huxley and Nagumo models and their relatives, such as the Bonhoeffer – van der Pol model, have been well studied within mathematics, also in computing and electronics
 More modern research has focused more on large and integrated systems and under which they have combined action potentials with other parts of the nervous system and in this way research can study computation nerves and also simple reflexes, such as escapes
 Reflexes that are controlled by the central pattern generator

 Jamaica is theoretically a monarchy, and the Jamaican ruler is its head of state, although the ruler exercises all of the constitutional powers as his representative, the Jamaican governor-general
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen "jamaica kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko "jamaica ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in Jamaica is in British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha

 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail

 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries

 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general

 yadi, iske bajaay, kaksha dirghavritt he, to surya us bindu par he jise dirghavritt kii "naabhi" kaha jaataa he, yah iske centre se thodaa alag he
 An ellipse has two focal points
 chunki surya dirghavritt kaksha ke centre par nahin he, grah jab surya kaa chakkar lagaate he, kabhi surya kii taraf kareeb chale aate he to kabhi usase pare dur chale jate he
 The place where the planet is closest to the Sun is called Upasour
 jab grah surya se pare sabase dur hota he, yah apsur par hota he
 When the Earth is at the summit, it is about 147 million km away from the Sun
 jab apsur par hoti he, surya se 15
2 karod kimi dur hoti he
 The Earth is 50 million km far from the Sun than the Upsaur at Upsaur

 The experimental term in this regard for the body circling other bodies is as follows: - mukhya aksh ek dirghavritt kaa sabase lanbaa vyas he, ek rekha jo centre or donon nabhiyon se hokar guzarati he, iske chor aakaar ke sarvaadhik duuri ke bindu he
 Half of the main axis is the semi-main axis and thus runs through the navel from the center to the edge of the ellipse; Essentially, it is a measure of the radius of the orbit, taken from the farthest points of the orbit
 vrutt ke vishesh maamle main, arddh-mukhya aksh ek trigya he
 In a way, the semi-major axis is the longest radius of an ellipse

 The victory of Yashodharman and Baladitya is the same event, or Yashodharman as the feudatory of Baladitya later defeated Mihirkul and later established his independent power, or Mihirkul was defeated in two places - Yashodharman in the west and Baladitya in the east or He was defeated first by Yashodharman and then by Baladitya etc
 It is not possible to tell any definite possibility
 yuvan chwad ke anusaar baladitya ke haathon parajeet hone par bhi mihirkul ne apana sir jhukaana nahin sweekaar kiya or kashmir main jaakar apana adhikaar sthapit kiya

 saamaajik sanvida kehane se praaia: do arthon kaa bodh hota he
 Firstly, social contract-specific, according to which some persons living in natural state contracted or stayed among themselves to enter into organized society, hence it is the principle of origin of state
 duusarre ko sarkari-sanvida kah sakate hai
 This contract or stagnation has nothing to do with the origin of the state, but by pre-imagining the existence of the state, it discusses the assumptions on which the governance of that state should be managed
 aitihaasik vikaas main sanvida ke in donon roopon kaa taarkik kram saamaajik sanvida kii charchaa baad main shuru hui
 But when all political science began to be discussed on the basis of the contract itself, then both these types of contracts started to be used - social contract for state origin and government contract to regularize its government
 yadhyapi saamaajik sanvida kaa siddhant apane ankur rup main sucraat ke vichaaron, sophist raajnneetik darshan evam roman vidhaan main miltaa he tathaa menegold ne ise janata ke adhikaron ke siddhant se joda, tathaapi iskaa pratham vistrut vivechan madhyayugin raajnneetik darshan main sarkari sanvida ke rup main praapt hota he
 This became the principle of contract as the basis of government
 yah vichaar na keval madhyayugin saamanti samaaj ke swabhavanukool varan madhyayugin isai mathadhishon ke paksh main bhi tha kyonki yah rajkeey satta kii seemayen nirdhaarit karne main sahaayak tha
 Even in the era of religious conflict of the 16th century, this doctrine became the basis for the justification of the opposition of the minorities to the government which accuses the religion of the majority
 is rup main isane kalvinavaad tathaa romanwaad donon alpsankhyakon ke uddeshyon kii purti kii
 But later on, instead of government contract, social contract was received by Hobbs, Locke and Russo
 spashtat: saamaajik sanvida main vishwaas kiye bina sarkari sanvida kii vivechna nahin kii ja sakati, parantu sarkari sanvida par vishwaas kiye bina saamaajik sanvida kaa vivechan avashya sambhav he
 a society created by a social contract can be autonomous, without distinguishing between the ruler and the governed and therefore without the possibility of another contract between them
 yah ruso kaa siddhant tha
 Secondly, a society built on a social contract can appoint a government as protection so that, even though it does not enter into a contract, it can elect to violate the rules of the guardian
 yah tha lock kaa siddhant
 Finally, once a social contract is built, society can delegate all its rights and powers to a sovereign sovereign who does not make any contract with the society and is therefore not within the limits of any government contract
 yah habs kaa siddhant tha
 Probably in India itself, the importance of the mighty king and social contract was first understood
 manusmriti, mahabharat ke shaantiparv tathaa chanakya ke arthshaastra main vyakt vichaar saamaajik sanvida kaa samarthan karte hai
 In the Mahabharata, Bhishma says- saamaajik sanvida ke mahatv ko vyakt karte hue bhishma aage kehete hai ki hamane suna he ki purvakaal main arajak praja ek duusare kaa vaise hi bhakshan karti thi jaise jal main badi machhlee choti machhlee kaa
 Bhishma further says- lekin bhishma kehete hai ki 'dhan-smapda chaahane vaale nar ko chaiye ki vah raja kii puja vaise hi kare jaise indra kii kii jaati he
 The king was considered 'divine'
 isi tarah ke vichaar dighanikaay main aaye hai
 Although the trauma on the principle of social contract started from the time of Hegel itself, it was the first to be most damaged by David Hume
 hum ke anusaar sarkaar kii sthapana sahmati par nahin, abhyaas par hoti he or is prakaar raajnneetik kritagyata kaa aadhaar bataaya tathaa bark ne vikasvaadi siddhant ke aadhaar par sanvida kii aalochana kii
 The principle of social contract is not only unproven from the point of view of historicity but is also faulty from the legal and philosophical point of view
 kisi sanvida ke vaid hone ke liye use rajya kaa sangrakshan evam avlamban praapt hona chahie; saamaajik sanvida ke peeche aisi kisi shakti kaa ullekh nahin
 Therefore it is illegal
 duusare, sanvida ke niyam sanvida karne waalon par hi aropit hote hai, unki santati par nahin
 The philosophical basis of the theory of social contract is also flawed
 yah dharna ki vyakti or rajya kaa sambandh vyakti ke aadhaarit swatantra sankalp par he, satya nahin he
 The state is neither an artificial creation nor its membership is voluntary, because a person can neither get membership at will nor can he renounce
 duusare, yah maanav itihaas ko prakritik tathaa saamaajik do avasthaaon main vibhajit karata he; aise vibhaajan kaa koi taarkik aadhaar nahin he; aaj kii sabhyataa utani hi prakritik samajhi jaati he jitani praarambhik kaal kii thi
 Thirdly, this theory presupposes that a person living in the natural state was aware of the idea of contract but it is not possible to imagine social responsibility for those who are not in the social state
 yadi prakritik vidhaan dwaara shasit koi prakritik avasthaa sweekaar kar lee jaae to aisi sthiti main rajya kii sthapana pragati kii nahin, varan paraavriti kii dyotak hogi, kyonki prakritik vidhaan ke sthaan par bal par aadhaarit rajya satta apnaanaa pratigaman hi hoga
 If the natural state was such that it could provide the idea of contract, then one would have to assume that man was still conscious of the common interest; From this point of view, he should also be conscious of social authority and individual rights
 or tab prakritik or saamaajik avasthaaon main koi antar nahin rah jaataa
 In the end, as Greene said, the major error of this theory is not its antiquity but that the basis in it is imagined by disambiguating them from society
 taarkik dhang par adhikaron kaa aadhaar samaaj kii sahmati he; adhikaar unheen logon ke bich sambhav he jinaki pravritiyaan evam abhilashaayen bauddhik hai
 Therefore, natural rights are not powers but only powers
 parantu in sabhi trutiyon ke hote hue bhi saamaajik sanvida kaa siddhant sarkaar ko sthayitv pradaan karne kaa ek prabal aadhaar he
 This theory establishes the idea that the base of the state is not a force, because the government is based on public consensus
 is drushti se yah siddhant janatantr kii aadharshilaon main se ek he

 Management includes organizing, organization-building, staffing, leadership, and controlling the organization or initiative
 sanghathan bhale hi bada ho yaa chota, laabh ke liye ho athwa gaiyr-laabh vaala, seva pradaan karata ho athwa vinirmaankarta, prabandh sabhi keliye aavashyak he
 Management is necessary so that individuals can make their best contribution towards the accomplishment of collective objectives
 prabandh main parsparik rup se sambandhit vah kaary sammilit hai jinhen sabhi prabandhak karte hai
 Managers spend different time on different tasks
 sanghathan ke ucchstar par baithe prabandhak niyojan evam sanghathan par neeche str ke prabandhakon kii tulana main adhik samay lagaate hai
 Many authors have given the definition of management
 prabandh shabd ek bahuprachlit shabd he jise sabhi prakaar kii kriyaaon ke liye vyapak rup se prayukt kiya gaya he
 By the way, it is mainly used for various activities of any enterprise
 uparokt udhaaharan evam vastusthiti ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho gaya hoga ki prabandh vah kriya he jo har us sanghathan main aavashyak he jisamen log samooh ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai
 People do different types of tasks in the organization but they still work to achieve the same purpose
 prabandh logon ke prayatnon evam samaan uddeshy ko praapt karne main disha pradaan karata he
 In this way, the management sees that the tasks are completed and the targets are achieved, at least at the least cost and minimum cost
 atah prabandh ko paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he ki yah uddeshyon ko prabhavi dhang se evam dakshata se praapt karne ke uddeshy se kaaryon ko puraa karaane kii prakriya he
 We need to analyze this definition
 kuch shabd aise hai jinka vistaar se varnan karnaa aavashyak he
 These words are- paribhaasha main prayukt prakriya se abhipraay he praathmik kaary athwa kriyaayein jinhen prabandh kaaryon ko puraa karaane ke liye karata he
 These tasks are - planning, organization, appointment, direction and control which will be discussed further in this chapter and in the book
 prabhavi athwa kaary ko prabhavi dhang se karne kaa vastav main abhipraayah die gaye kaary ko sampann karnaa he
 Effective management is about doing the right thing, completing actions and achieving objectives
 duusare shabdon main, iskaa kaary antim parinaam praapt karnaa he
 But just completing the work is not enough, there is another aspect of it and that is efficiency ie doing the work efficiently
 kushalta kaa arth he kaary ko sahi dhang se nunatam laagat par karnaa
 There is a kind of cost-benefit analysis and the relation between input and output
 yadi kam sadhano kaa upyog kar adhik laabh praapt karte hai to ham kahenge ki kshamta main vruddhi hui he
 Efficiency will be increased if less resources are used for the same benefit or output and less cost is incurred
 aagat saadhan ve hai jo kisi kaary vishesh ko karne ke liye aavashyak dhan, maal upkaran evam maanav sansaadhan hon
 Naturally, management is related to the efficient use of these resources because they reduce costs and in the end they increase profits
 yah donon shabd alag-alag hote hue bhi ek duusare se sambandhit hai
 It is important to have both effective and efficient management
 prabhaavapurntaa evam kaushal donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 But balance between these two sides is necessary and sometimes management has to compromise efficiency
 udhaaharan ke liye prabhaavapurn hona evam kushalta kii andekhi karnaa saral he jiskaa arth he kaary ko puraa karnaa lekin unchi laagat par
 For example, suppose a company aims to produce 8,000 units in a year
 is lakshya ko paane ke liye adhikansh samay bijli na milane par prabandhak prabhavotpadak to tha lekin kshamtawan nahin tha kyonki, usee nirgat ke liye adhik aagat kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Sometimes business focuses more on the production of goods with less resources, ie reduced the cost but failed to produce the scheduled production
 parinamswaroop maal bazaar main nahin pahunch paaya isliye isaki maang kam ho gai tathaa iskaa sthaan pratiyogiyon ne le liya
 This is a situation of lack of efficiency but effectiveness as the goods did not reach the market
 isliye nunatam laagat par prabandhak liye lakshyon ko praapt karnaa adhik mahatvapurn he
 For this, balance has to be made in effectiveness and efficiency
 saadharantaya ucch kaary kushalta ke saath ucch prabhaavapurntaa hoti he jo ki sabhi prabandhakon kaa lakshya hota he
 But unduly emphasizing high work efficiency without effectiveness is also undesirable
 kamjor prabandhan prabhaavapurntaa evam kaarykushal dona kii kami ke kaaran hota he
 After studying some definitions, we get to know some elements which we call the basic features of management
 prabandh kuch uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye kaary karata he
 Objectives are the expected results of any action
 inhen vyavsaay ke mul prayojan se praapt kiya janaa chahie
 Any organization has different objectives and management has to achieve all these objectives effectively and efficiently
