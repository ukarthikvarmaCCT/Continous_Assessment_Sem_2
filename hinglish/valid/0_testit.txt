 Ali wrote in his instructions to Malik al-ashtar: chunki 'ali ke adhikansh log nammaatr or kisaan the, isliye vah krishi se chintit the
 He instructed Malik to pay more attention to the development of land than to the collection of tax, because the tax can only be derived from the development of land and anyone who asks for tax without developing land would have ruined the country

 Eventually, Hasan was forced to make peace and produce Kuwaifa in Muawiyah

 The Umayyad Caliphate later became a centralized monarchy by Abd al-malik ibn Marwan

 The regular public curse of Imam Ali in congregational prayers remained an important institution that was not abolished after 60 years by Omar ibn Abd al-aziz

 According to the fake Umayyad Islam claims legitimate sovereignty in Islam as a sub-rule of God, and in the context of Umayyad betrayal, arbitrary and divisive government and vindictive vengeance, they came to appreciate his honesty, his unbearable devotion
 The rule of Islam, his deep personal loyalty, the equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies
 afghanistan ke majaari sharif main roj-e-shareef, blue masjid - jahaan musalamaanon kii alpsankhyak maanati he ki ali ebn abu talib ko dafnaaya gaya he
 According to al-sheikh al-mufid, Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently he asked his friends and family to bury him quietly

 Most Shi'ites accept that Ali is buried at the tomb of Imam Ali in the Imam Ali Mosque which is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the mosque and temple called Masjid Ali

 Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority
 dharamshastra or exegesis se sulekh or ank vigyaan se vishyon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa, kanoon or rahasyavaad se arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti se ali dwaara pehali baar mana jaataa he
 According to a hadith described by the Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told of them, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate 


" Muslims consider Ali a major authority in Islam
 shiya ke mutabik, ali ne khud hi yah gavaahi di: There was not a single verse of the Quran but was revealed, which he did not proceed to direct me and read to me
 main ise apane haath se likhuunga, or vah mujhe apane tafaseer or tavil, nasikh ke rup main nirdeshit karegaa or manasmukh, muhakkam or matashabih, vishesh or saamaanya 


 According to Seyed Hossein Nasser, Ali is credited with establishing Islamic theology and his citations include the first rational evidence of the unity of God among Muslims
 ebn abi al-hadeed ne uddhrut kiya he For the sake of doctrine and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art
 is tarah ke kuch bhi unke vishisht aankadon yaa nichle rankon main se kuch ke bich prasaarit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sage was the only extender
 arabon ke bich sauda karne vaala pehla vyakti ali tha
 In later Islamic philosophies, especially in the teachings of Mulla Sadra and his followers, like Alemeh Tabatatei, Ali's stories and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of spiritual knowledge, or divine philosophy
 sadara ke skool ke sadsy ali ko islam ke sarvocch aadhyatmik chikitsak maanate hai
 According to Henry Corbin, Nahj al-balagha can be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines made by Shiite thinkers, especially after 1500
 iskaa prabhaav shabdon ke taarkik samanvay, katautee main mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he sahi nishkarshon ke, or arabi main kuch takneekee sharton kaa nirmaan jo saahitiyik or darshanik bhashaa main swatantra rup se unani granthon ke arabi main anuwaad ke pravesh main pravesh kiya
 In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as Jafar, Islamic numerology, and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, have been established by Ali, through which he al-jafar and al-jamia
 ali arabi sahitya kaa ek mahaan vidwaan bhi tha or arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti ke kshetra main agrani tha
 Many of Ali's short stories have become part of the general Islamic culture and are cited in daily life as excitement and stories
 ve saahitiyik kaaryon kaa aadhaar bhi ban gaye hai yaa kai bhashaaon main kavy kavita main ekikrut kiye gaye hai
 In the 8th century, literary authorities such as' Abd al-hamid ibn Yahya al-amiri pointed to Ali's unique pronunciation of sermons and stories, as did al-jahiz in the following century
 umayyaad ke divaan ke karmchaariyon ne bhi apane vakprachaar ko sudhaarney ke liye ali ke upadeshon ko padhaa
 The most famous selection of Ali's words and writings is gathered by a 10th-century Shia scholar, al-sharif al-radi, in a book called Nahj al-balgha, who selected him for his singular rhetorical beauty
 pustak main uddhrut upadeshon ke bich note, andekha upadesh ke saath hi alef ke upadesh bhi he
 According to the legends, some of Muhammad's companions were discussing the role of letters in speaking
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki bolne main alef kaa sabase bada yogadan tha or bindidaar patr bhi mahatvapurn the
 Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one according to shell writer Langroudy, without using the letter Aleph and the other without dotted letters, without deep and eloquent concepts
 ek isai lekhak jorge Jordac, ne kaha ki Aleph or dot ke bina upadesh saahitiyik kriti ke rup main mana janaa tha
 Ali is respected for his deep sympathy and support for the poor and orphans, and he pursued similar egalitarian policies during his caliphate with the aim of achieving social justice
 unhen yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he: If God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, then he should show kindness to his worthy kith and kin, provide for the poor, help those who are suffering from disasters, misfortune and the reverse, help the poor And honest people should help in ending their debt


 yah kitaab al- kaaphi main sunai gai he ki amir al-muminine ali ebn abi talib ko baghdad ke paas sthanon se shahad or anjir ke saath prastut kiya gaya tha
 Upon receiving the gift, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they could lick the honey from the containers while he rested himself among the people
 nahaj al-balgha main ali ke liye jimmedaar bolne vaale upadesh, patr or uddhran shaamil hai jinhen raakh-sharif aar-radio dwaara sankalit kiya gaya he
 Reza Shah Kazemi states: "despite ongoing questions about the authenticity of the text, recent scholarship suggests that much of the material in it may actually be attributed to Ali" and in support of an article by Mokhtar Jebali Gives reference
 arabi sahitya main is pustak kii ek pramukh sthiti he
 It is also considered an important intellectual, political and religious work in Islam
 nahajul balagha ke urdu anuvadak saiyad jishaan haidar javaadee ne eech 204 se 488 tak 61 lekhakon or unke lekhakon kii suchi sankalit kii he, or un sroton ko pradaan kiya he jinamein sharif kaa sankalan kaary razi kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Masadir Nahj al-balagha wa Asanidah, written by al-sayyid ‘abd al-zahra’ al-husayn al-khatib, offers some of these sources
 iske alaava, mohammad baqir al- mahamudi dwaara nahaj al-saadah faai mastadra nahaj al-balaghah ali ke maujuuda bhaashanon, upadeshon, niyamon, patron, prarthanaaon or ekatrit hone vaale kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 There are many commentaries from Sunnis and Shias such as Ibn Abi al-hadid's comments and Muhammad Abdudh's commentaries

 aakhri kii maut sandigdh he
 Some historians have added the names of Ali's other sons, including Ibrahim, Umar and Abdallah ibn al-askar, who were killed in Karbala

 Ali's descendants are known as Sharifs, stories or stories by Fatima
 ye arabi main aadarneey khitaab hai, sharif kaa arth 'mahaan' he or kaha jaataa he yaa kaha jaataa he yaa 'bhagwaan' yaa 'sar' kahata he
 As the only descendants of Muhammad, he is respected by both Sunni and Shia
 mohammad ke alaava, islamic itihaas main koi bhi nahin he jiske bare main islamic bhashaaon main ali ke rup main likhaa gaya he
 In Muslim culture, Ali is honored for his courage, wisdom, faith, honesty, devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving defeated enemies, and therefore of mystical traditions The center is like Sufism in Islam
 ali kuranik exegesis, islamic nyaayashasre or dharmik vichaar par ek adhikaar ke rup main apane kad barkaraar rakhata he
 Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders that trace his lineage to Muhammad through them
 puure islamic itihaas main ali kaa prabhaav mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Sunni and Shia scholars agree that the verse of Wilayah was recited in honor of Ali, but Wilayah and Imamate have different interpretations
 sunni vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kavita ali ke bare main he, lekin unhen shiya muslim vichaar main, imam ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa jaataa he, ali ko bhagwaan dwaara mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 There are several verses interpreted by Shia scholars referring to Ali or other Shia Imams
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue ki quran main imam ke naamon kaa ullekh kyon nahin kiya gaya he, mohammad al-baqir uttar dete hai: "allaah ne apane paigambar ko salaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin teen yaa chaar rakaton ke bare main kabhi nahin kaha, jakaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin iske vivaranon kaa zikr nahin kiya haj lekin iske tawaaf or paigambar kii ginati nahin hui thi 
 He revealed this verse and the Prophet said that this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Hussain and the twelve Imams
 " ali ke anusaar kuranik chhandon kii ek chauthai imam ke stesan ko bataa rahi he
 Mammen lists many of these verses in his introduction to Shia Islam
 haalanki, kuch chand hai ki kuch sunni tippaneekar ali ke sandarbh main vyakhya karte hai, jinamein se vilaah kii kavita he ki sunni or shiya vidwaan is ghatana ko sanderbhit karte hai ali ne apni anguthi ko ek bhikhaari ko diya jisane masjid main anushthan prarthana karte hue bhakton se poocha
 Mavadda's poem is one of the verses, both Sunni and Shiite associated Ali's name with some other names
 mubahaalaa kii uparokt kavita, or yah bhi pad 2: 26 9 jisamen ali ko shiya or sunni donon tippaneekaron dwaara adwitiya gyaan ke saath sammanit kiya jaataa he is tarah ke chand
 The Shia consider Ali the most important person after Muhammad and he represents a complex, mythological figure in his memory
 vah gunon kaa ek paragon he, jaise saahas, mahanata, eemaandaaree, sidhaapan, vakprachaar or gahan gyaan
 Ali was righteous but faced injustice, he was authoritative but kind and courteous, vigorous but also patient, learned but also a laboring man
 shiya ke anusaar, mohammad ne apane jeevankaal ke dauraan vibhinn avasaron par suzav diya ki unki mrityu ke baad ali musalamaanon kaa netaa hona chahie
 It is supported by many hadiths, narrated by Shams, including the Hadith of the pond of Khum, the Hadiths of two weighty things, the Hadiths of pen and paper, the Hadiths of the Cloak, the Hadiths of the post, the invitation of the Nimath close family, and the twelve successors The Hadith
 jafar al-sadik haddees main varnan karata he ki mohammad main jo bhi gun paaya gaya vah ali main paaya gaya tha, jo uske maargdarshan se dur hokar allaah or uske paigambar se dur ho jayega
 Ali himself describes that he is the gateway and overseer to reach Allah
 is drushtikon ke anusaar, mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ali ne nyaay main samudaay par shashan nahin kiya, balki sharia kanoon or iske gudh arth kaa bhi arth diya 
 He was therefore considered free from error and sin, and ordained by God by divine decree through Muhammad
 yah twailvar or ismali shi islam main mana jaataa he ki 'ekl, divine gyaan, bhavishyavaktaaon or imaamon kii atmaaon kaa strot tha or unhen goom naamak gudh gyaan diya gaya tha or unke dukh unke bhakton ko divya krupa kaa saadhan the
 Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation, he had a close relationship with God through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides people
 unke shabdon or karm samudaay ke liye ek guide or model hai;natijatan yah sharia kanoon kaa strot he
 Shia pilgrims usually go to Mashad Ali in Najaf for Ziyarat, pray there and recite "ziyarat Amin Allah" or other Ziyaratnam
 safavid samrajya ke tahat, unki kabr bahut samarpit dhyaan kaa centre ban gai, shah ismail pratham dwaara najaaf or karbala kii tirthayatra main udhaaharan diya gaya
 Many Shia Muslims also celebrate Imam Ali's birth anniversary as Father's Day
 gregory tithi is ke liye har saal badalata he: Main article: Sunni visions of Ali see Sunnis as the fourth caliph
 ali islam ke sabase mahaan yoddha champiyanon main se ek ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Examples include the inclusion of a Quraish champion in the Battle of the Trench when no one else feared
 khayabar kii ladaai main kile ko todane ke kai asafal prayaason ke baad, ali ko bulaayaa gaya, chamatkaarik rup se thik ho gaya or kile par vijay praapt hui
 Almost all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception to the Naqshbandi that went through Abu Bakr
 yahaan tak ki is aadesh main, ali ke mahaan mahaan pote jafar al-sadik hai 
 Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad the saturated Shakti Vilah that makes spiritual travel to God possible
 jaise prakhyat sufi ali huviri kaa daawa he ki parampara ali ke saath shuru hua or junaid of baaghdaad ke rup main mana ali shaikh siddhanton or sufi mat ke prathaon ke
 Sufis read Manakbat Ali in praise of Ali
 ali ko kuch paramparaon main darj kiya gaya he kyonki un logon ko manaa kar diya jinhone apane jeevankaal main unki puja karne kii maang kii thi
 Some groups like the Alawites are believing that Ali was God incarnate
 islamic vidwaanon ke bahumat se unhen gulaat ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to traditional Muslims, Islam has been abandoned in these groups because of the exaggeration of human admirable qualities
 main ali-illahism, ek samadharmi vishwaas kiya gaya lagaataar vahaan he par dharm kendron avatar unke ke devtaa puure itihaas main, or bhandar 'ali, mohammad kaa betaa ji ne aise hi ek avatar mana jaataa he ke liye vishesh rup se shraddha
 Druze, a syncretic religion, believes that God was a descendant of al-hakim bi-amr Allah Ali, in particular the incarnated human being
 yah bhi dekhen: praarambhik islam kii aitihaasiktaali ke jivan par chaatravrutti ke liye praathmik strot quran or ahmadi hai, saath hi praarambhik islamic itihaas ke anya granth bhi hai
 Extensive secondary sources include the writings of Sunni and Shea Muslims, Christian Arabs, Hindus, and other non-muslims from the Middle East and Asia, and in addition to some works by modern Western scholars
 haalanki, shuruaati islamic sroton main se kuch ali kii taraf sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak purvaagrah se kuch had tak rangeen hai
 Against these assertions there had previously been a common trend among Western scholars and there were reports collected in later periods due to the tendency towards Sunni and Shea biased positions; Later such scholars about him as texture
 isse unhen kuch report kiye gaye kaaryakramon ko anaupchaarik yaa apraasangik mana jaataa he
 Leon Kaitani considered Ibn Abbas and Aisha to be a feature of historical reports during the profits of accounts reported without Isnad by early compilers of history such as Ibn Issaq
 wilferd madelang ne "shuruaati sroton" main shaamil nahin hone vaali har cheez ko andhadhundh rup se khaarij karne ke rukh ko khaarij kar diya he or is drushtikon main akele pravriti ko der se utpatti ke liye koi saboot nahin he
 According to him, Kaitani's approach is inconsistent
 medalang or kuch baad ke itihaaskaar baad kii avadhi main sankalit kiye gaye kathaon ko asweekaar nahin karte hai or itihaas ke sandarbh main or ghatnaon or aankadon ke saath unki sangatta ke aadhaar par unka nyaay karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Until the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate, few books were written and most reports were oral

 When the paper was introduced to Muslim society, several monographs were written between 750 and 950

 iraq ke shiya ne monograph likhane main sakriy rup se bhaag liya lekin unamem se adhikansh kaam kho gaye hai
 On the other hand, the descendants of Ali in the 8th and 9th centuries describe their citations and reports as Sadiq, such as Muhammad al-baqir and Jafar, which are collected in the Shia Hadith books
 10 veen shatabdi ke baad likhaa gaya shiya kaam karata he jo chaudaa infalibles or baarah imam kii jeevani ke bare main he

 In the first few meetings of the board, it was decided early on that it was necessary to change the club's name to reflect their efforts to recognize the new beginning

 He insisted on adopting unusual methods for his work, choosing the team of his choice, signing players of his choice and directing the team's training sessions on his own
 At his former club, Liverpool, he had already lost his manager's job as the club saw these tasks as a director's job, but United decided to give Busby's new ideas a chance
 basbi dwaara sin kiya gaya pehla vyakti koi khilaadi nahin apitu jimi murphi ke naam se ek nayaa sahaayak menager tha
 The risk taken by the club to appoint Busby was immediately benefited when the club finished second on the league in 1947,1948 and 1949 and succeeded in winning the FA Cup in 1948 with Stan Pearson as a local trio, Jack Rowley and Charlie Mitton as well as Center Half Allenby Chilton from the North East were a major contributor

 At the end of the season, UEFA offered the FA to send both United and the then winner, Wolverhampton Wanderers, as a tribute to the victims for the 1958–59 European Cup, but the FA refused
 The following season saw United beat Wolves to a remarkable second place, which was not bad for a team that had lost nine first-team players in the Munich air crash

 The team won the FA Cup in 1963, though finishing 19th in the first division
 The FA Cup victory boosted the morale of the players resulting in the club finishing second in 1964 and then winning the league in 1965 and 1967, doing better
 United became the first English club to win the tournament, defeating Eusebio's Benfica in the final of the 1968 European Cup
 united kii yah team varsh ke teen sarvshereshth europea footbal khilaadiyon : bobi charlton, denis lau or jorge best ko shaamil karne ke kaaran prasiddh thi

 Docherty, or "the Dock", saved United from a fall that season, but suffered a fall in 1974 due to Best, Law and Charlton's gold trio leaving the club
 Dennis Law moved to Manchester City in the summer of 1973 and scored what many consider to be the reason for United's downfall and politely declined to celebrate the goal with his teammates
 Players such as Lou Makari, Stewart Houston and Brian Greenhoff were replaced by Best, Law and Charlton, but none competed against the first three players

 In the summer of 1977, Dave Sexton became the manager in place of Docherty and made the team's game more defensive
 This style was unpopular among supporters who used to watch aggressive football supported by Dockerty and Busby

 Many of the players signed by Ferguson did not live up to the expectations of fans and reached the verge of being fired from a manager job in the early 1990s, when many believed the defeat to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup Will seal his fate
 a goal by Mark Robbins in the 56th minute saw United win the match and bring them to the Cup race, eventually reaching Wembley in the final, where, after a 3-3 draw in the original match, Crystal Palace in the extra game Defeated 1–0
 The following year, United reached the final of the League Cup, but lost 1–0 to former manager Ron Atkinson's Sheffield Wednesday team

 Meanwhile, off-field events were happening around the end of the decade, when chairman Martin Edwards tried to sell the club to property market leader Michael Knighton in 1989
 The deal was confirmed at £ 20 million, with Knighton taking the entire Trafford United kit along with Old Trafford ground and negotiating a few more before the ball was sent to Stretford

 He led the team to a fourth league title in five years in 1996–97 and retired from football at the age of 30 at the end of the season

 After a highly tense Premier League season, Manchester United won the title by defeating Tottenham Hotzper 2–1 on the final day, while Arsenal won 1–0 against Aston Villa
 Winning the Premier League was the first part of the trio described by manager Alex Ferguson as the most difficult part

 Ferguson adopted more defensive tactics to make United undefeated in Europe, but it did not succeed and United finished third in the 2001–02 Premier League season
 He reclaimed the league the following season and made a good start to the coming season, but his form dropped drastically when Rio Ferdinand faced a controversial eight-month suspension for missing a drug test
 
 However, in 2004, they beat Arsenal on their way to the final, in which they eventually won the FA Cup by defeating Milwell

 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he

 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods

 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent

 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he

 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation

 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed

 Among them, the names of Sonu Nigam, Muhammad Aziz and Udit Narayan are notable - although many of them now have their own distinct identity

 The doodle was created by Mumbai painter Sajid Sheikh
 mohammad rafi kaa janm 24 disambar 1924 ko amritsar, ke paas kotla sultan singh main hua tha

 kaha jaataa he ki rafi jab saat saal ke the to ve apane bade bhai kii dukaan se hokar guzarane vaale ek fakir kaa peechha kiya karte the jo udhar se gaate hue jaaya karata tha
 Rafi liked his voice and Rafi used to imitate him
 unki nakal main awvalata ko dekhakar logon ko unki aawaaj bhi pasand aane lagi
 People started praising her songs in the barber shop
 lekin isse rafi ko sthaneey khyaati ke atirikt or kuch nahin mila
 His elder brother Mohammad Hameed noticed his interest in his music and asked him to take music education to Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan
 ek baar akashwani lahore main us samay ke prakhyat gayak-abhinayta kundan laal sahagal apana pradarshan karne aae the
 Mohammad Rafi and his elder brother also went to hear this
 bijli gul ho jane kii vajah se sahagal ne gane se manaa kar diya
 Rafi's elder brother requested the organizers that Mohammad Rafi should be given a chance to sing in order to calm the anxiety of the crowd
 unako anumati mil gai or 13 varsh kii aayu main mohammad rafi kaa ye pehla saarvajanik pradarshan tha
 Among the observers, Shyam Sundar, who was a famous musician of that time, also heard him and was impressed
 unhone mohammad rafi ko apane liye gane kaa nyauta diya
 Mohammed Rafi's first song was for a Punjabi film Gul Baloch which he sang in 1944 under the direction of Shyam Sundar
 san 1946 main mohammad rafi ne bombay aane kaa faisla kiya
 Music composer Naushad gave him the opportunity to sing in a film called Aap

 Shankar Jaikishan was Raj Kapoor's favorite composer at the time, but Raj Kapoor liked Mukesh's voice only
 baad main jab shankar jaykishan ke gaanon kii maang badi to unhone lagbhag har jagah rafi sahab kaa prayog kiya
 Even Rafi Sahab sang for Raj Kapoor many times
 jald hi sangeetkaar sachin dev burman tathaa ullekhneey rup se o pi naiyyar ko rafi kii awaz bahut raas aayi or unhone rafi se gavaana aarambh kiya
 OP Nayyar's name will be remembered in it as he used the rafi-asha duo in his unique style and his tinkling tunes still seem different from other composers of that era
 unke nirdesan main gaae gaano se rafi ko bahut khyaati mili or phir ravi, madan mohan, gulam haidar, jayadev, salil choudhary ityadi sangeetkaaron kii pehali pasand rafi sahab ban gaye
 After singing for artists such as Dilip Kumar, Bharat Bhushan and Devanand, the list of artists who performed on their songs increased
 shammi kapur, rajendra kumaar, joy mukherjee, vishwajit, rajesh khanna, dharmendra ityadi kalakaaron ke liye rafi kii aawaaj prishthbhumi main gunjane lagi
 Shammi Kapoor was so impressed with Rafi's voice that he used Rafi in each of his songs
 unke liye sangeet kabhi o pi naiyyar ne diya to kabhi shankar jaykishan ne par aawaaj rafi kii hi rahi
 Whether someone calls me Junglee, Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujper Mein, Ye Chand Sa Roshan Face, Deewana Hua Badal is one of the popular songs filmed on top of Shammi Kapoor
 dhire-dhire inaki khyaati itani bad gayi ki abhinayta inhen se gaanaa gavaane kaa aagrah karne lage

 1977 main film ham kisi se kam nahin ke geet kya hua tera vaada ke liye unhe apane jivan kaa chatha tathaa antim film fere eword mila
 Mohammad Rafi was a very devoted Muslim, a man away from addictions and a shy man
 aazaadee ke samay vibhaajan ke dauraan unhone bharat main rahanaa pasand kiya
 He married Begum Wikis and had seven children - four sons and three daughters
 mohammad rafi ko unke parmartho ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 He was very cheerful and generous and always ready to help everyone
 kai filmi geet unhonen bina paise liye yaa behad kam paison lekar gaaye
 In his early days, he sang for the composer duo laxmikant-pyarelal for very little money
 gaanon kii roylty ko lekar lata mangeshkar ke saath unka vivaad bhi unki dariyaadilii kaa suchak he
 At that time, Lataji said that even after singing the songs, singers and singers should get a part of the income from those songs
 rafi sahab iske kilaaf the or unka kahana tha ki ek baar gane record ho gaye or gayak-gayikaon ko unki fees kaa bhugtan kar diya gaya ho to unako or paison kii aashaa nahin kerani chahie
 There was a conflict between the two great artists about this
 lata ne rafi ke saath set par gane se manaa kar diya or barason tak dono kaa koi yugal geet nahin aayaa
 Later, at the behest of actress Nargis, both of them started singing together and sang Dil Pukare in the Jewel Thief film
 unka dehant 31 july 1980 ko hridaygati ruk janeke kaaran hua
 There is some controversy over how many songs Rafi sang in his life
 1970 ke dashak main gineez book of world ricards ne likhaa ki sabase adhik gane ricard karne kaa shrey lata mangeshkar ko praapt he, jinhone kul 25,000 gane ricard kiye hai
 Rafi wrote a letter to the Guinness Book, refuting it
 iske baad ke sanskarnon main gineez book ne donon gayakon ke daawey saath-saath pradarshit kiye or mohammad rafi ko 1944 or 1980 ke bich 28,000 gane ricard karne kaa shrey diya
 In the subsequent search, Vishwas Nerurkar found that Lata had actually sung only 5,044 songs till 1989
 anya shodhakartaaon ne bhi is tathy ko sahi mana he
 Additionally, Raju Bharatan found that between 1948 and 1987 only 35,000 Hindi songs were recorded
 aise main rafi ne 28,000 gane gaae is baat par yakeen karnaa mushkil he, lekin kuch strot ab bhi is sankhya ko uddhrut karte hai
 After this research, in 1992, the Guinness Book removed the above record of singing from the book

 longinus paramparaagat rup se "kavy main udaatt tatv" naamak kriti kaa rachanaakaar mana jaataa he
 The effects of good writing are discussed in this work
 longinus kaa asli naam gyaat nahin he
 He was a teacher of Greek Kavyalochan
 uskaa kaal pehali se lekar teesri shadi tak hone kaa anumaan he
 Longinus has proposed this theory considering the elements that make poetry better
 ve udaatt ko kavy ko shreshth banane vaala tathaa kavi ko pratishtha dilaane vaala tatv maanate hai
 It is rooted in the dignity of lofty great ideas organized ornamentation plan, aristocratic designation and influence
 ve vagadambar baleyata or bhavanumbar ko udaadtta main baadhak tatv maanate hai
 Just as in Indian poetry, different views have been made about the nature of poetry and its soul, similarly in the field of western criticism, different thinkers have discovered the origin of poetry or literature in different eras
 plato ne anukaran ko sahitya kaa mul tatva mana
 Pallavan Aristotle did this with his vision and accepted Virechan as the object of literature
 isi prakaar lonzinus kaa udaatt siddhanth he
 Through this theory, he has made it clear that no artwork or poetry can be a masterpiece without a sublime element
 shreshth vahi he jisamen rachayita kaa gahan chintan or anubhutiyaan rahati hai
 This feeling of the creator makes the creation great due to its greatness, sublime, grandeur or dignity
 rachana yaa kriti shilp ke dwaara abhivyakti paati he; kintu udaatt rachana kaa lekhak apni rachana main shilp ke soundarya kii adhik chintaa na karke usamen nihit anubhuti ko hi sabal banane kaa ytn karata he
 Acharya Longines, who presents this sublime principle
 inkaa unani bhashaa kaa naam longinus tathaa angreji bhashaa main uccharit 'lonzinus' he
 His work is titled 'perihutsuus', which was translated into English as 'on the Sublime'
 isi ko hindi main udaatt kii sangya di gai
 Its book is the main text of Western literature
 lonzinus ne udaatt kii paribhaasha or uskaa saamaanya parichay jis rup main diya he usase prathit hota he ki unke samay main yah shabd itnaa adhik prachlit ho gaya tha ki unhone iskaa vistrut parichay dene kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi
 Still, clarifying the nature of the sublime, he said this much- arthath abhivyakti kii vishistataa or shreshthata kaa naam udaatt he
 By aiming at this, Hindi critics have accepted that the lofty element in a composition is expressed by appropriate and dignified word-legislation, a rhetorical scheme of impulse, and composition-legislation
 lonzinus ne kavy ke udaatt ko vaktruta se ekadam bhinn bataaya he, kyonki kavy main shrotaaon par udaatt kaa prabhaav tanmayata ke rup main hota he, pravartan ke rup main nahin
 For this reason, in the sight of Longinus, there is a grand poem which, due to the joyousness, makes us so engrossed and attuned to reach such a high sense where the subject of the light is illuminated like electric light
 is drushti se lonzinus ko anandatirek or vishwanath ke vigalit-vedyantar main bahut kuch samya dekha ja saktaa he
 In the form of the sublime, both the psychological and the behavioral aspects were exposed in Longinus
 isi se unhone ek ore udaatt ke aantarik tattvon kaa ullekh kiya he or duusari ore uske bahya paksh kii bhi vivechna kii he
 What is Sublime Basis? Is it based on the innate talent of the speaker or writer, or can it be considered by the rise of education or dependent on practice? Longinus has followed the Middle Way, considering these questions
 unke vichaar se udaatt na to sarvatha pratibha saapeksh he or na purnatah abhyaas-saapeksh
 In fact, the basis of the sublime is not one aspect, one quality or one tendency of the person but a glimpse of the entire personality behind it
 atah udaatt kaa sristaa udaatt vyaktitv hi ho saktaa he
 Only a person of great genius, high scholar and celebrity can be a sublime or an announcer
 lonzinus ke anusaar - ‘‘udaatt aatma kii mahanata kaa pratibimb he
 True sublime is attainable only in those whose consciousness is sublime and development oriented
 yah sarvatha swaabhaavik he ki jinke mastishk udaatt dharanaon se paripurna he unheen kii vaani se udaatt shabd zankrut ho sakate hai
 '' is prakaar udaatt kaa sambandh keval pratibha, adhyayan or bhashaa ke adhyayan se nahin, apitu vyakti ke samooche vyaktitv se he
 In conclusion uskaa prabhaav kramik nahin, aakasmik hota he or uske alolik alok se katha chamak uthati he
 Although the foundation of the sublime lies in the greatness of the personality of the litterateur, in order to bring the element of sublime into the composition, Loninus has discussed five sources - uparyukt paanchon tattvon main se pratham do janmajaat arthath kavi-pratibha ke ang hai or shesh teen kala sambandhi visheshtaayen hai
 The first place among the sources of the sublime is the importance of thought
 isi ko lonzinus ne shabd-bhed se aatma kii bhavyata bhi kaha he
 His clear statement is - "the soul of the sublime great is echoed
 ’’ yadi aatma kii yah mahatta naiysargik na ho to utkrisht vichaaron dwaara use praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Great words come out of his mouth in which thoughts are deep and deep
 mahaan vichaaron se sampann, atmotthanayukt sahityakar hi udaatt-srijan kar sakate hai
 This is such a concept of Longinus, to which his concept of sublime effect is also connected
 udaatt kaa prabhaav atmatikraman hota he, anunayan nahin
 This belief specializes that soul-order is possible only with the graceful expression of grand and great ideas
 vastutah atmik mahanata udaatt srujana kii pehali shart he, isiilie udaatt kaa prabhaav bhi natikrup se kalyankari hi mana jayega
 Thus the effect of sublime literature should be considered to be good from both moral and artistic point of view
 is drushti se lonzinus or mahakavi milton ek hi str par utarate hai
 According to Milton, to become a great litterateur one should emulate great and highly honorable things
 milton kaa mat he- Manavis easily get this grand voice
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki pratibhashali kavi apane jivan ke sandhya kaal main ast hote hue surya kii tarah thanda ho jaataa he or uske parvarti kavy main udaatt kii kami dikhaai dene lagati he
 Homer has the same astral-gamini talent in Odissi
 lonzinus kaa kathan he- ‘‘iliyat homer kii tarunai kii rachana hai, kyonki isamen gati or sangharsh kaa prachurya hai
 In contrast, the majority of the Odyssey are narrative, a product of old age
 ’’ hindi main maithilisharan gupt ke ‘vishnu priya’ or ‘ratnavali’ isi prakaar ke kavy hai, jinamein inaki pratibha kaa apakarsh dekha ja saktaa he
 The later poetry of Pant and Bachchan are also examples of this
 lonzinus ne kalakriti main uddaam aavegon kii anivaaryta par bal diya he, kyonki kriti ke mahaan hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki pathakon ko bhaavnaatmak uttejnaa pradaan kare
 Emotions or grand impulses are those from which the 'soul' starts to rise on its own and then gets filled with joy
 lonzinus ne aavegon ke do varg banaae hai- ek bhavy or doosraa nimna
 High impulses in grand impulses, ie, exalted emotion, compute probability, respect, amazement, gaiety and valor etc
, while low impulses are associated with compassion, grief and fear
 kavy main udaatt bharne ke liye ucch bhavaveshon kaa grahan tathaa nimna bhavaveshon kaa tyaag hona chahie
 Longinus is of the view that the use of ornaments should be done in such a manner that no one should notice that it is ornamentation
 kala jab kaushalpurvak prayukt kii jaati he to vah apane soundarya or chamatkaar ke vinyas ko kho detii he
 Actually do not marvel at the ornamentation, but it should be for joy
 lonzinus ne athishaymulak alankaaron ko udaatt kaa hetu mana he
 According to him, sublime exists in elaborations like elaborations, oaths, questioning, antonyms, defaults, repetition, articulation, accumulation, essence, transformation, synonyms, exaggeration etc
 atah udaatt ke liye alankaaron kaa sahaj or auchitypurna hona anivaary he
 For example abhijaat abhivyakti se lonzinus kaa taatpary kavy bhashaa he
 He has laid special emphasis on language excellence; Because the expression of sublime is through language
 padaavalee kaa vishayanukool, upyukt prabhaav evam sugumphit hona anivaary he, kyonki urjaswit bhashaa ke prayog dwaara rachanaakaar aisi kriti kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he, jiskaa prabhaav durnivaar ho
 Through appropriate and effective vocabulary, the composition incorporates the qualities of grandeur, dignity, ooze, madave, power etc
 and communicates aliveness
 rachana-vidhaan kaa arth he samanjit shabd-yojana yaa ek nishchit kram se shabdon kii yojana
 According to Longinus, the mutual harmony of various elements makes the work dignified
 jaise sharir ke vibhinn avyavon ke swatantra rahane par koi mahatva nahin he, sabase milane par hi sampoorn sharir kii rachana sambhav hoti he, usee prakaar samast tattvon ke sanyog dwaara hi garimamay kriti kii rachana hoti he
 When all the elements of composition are tied together in a series of harmony, then only they become sublime
 anyathaa vah bikhar jaataa he
 Sometimes the harmony of the composition elements supplies the damage that arises from a particular element of the composition and thus this harmony keeps the sublime effect intact
 atah garimamay evam bhavy rachana-vidhaan bhi udaatt-srijan kaa poshak he
 Longinus has also considered the opposing elements of sublime
 unhone baleyata, asanyat vagvistaar, ast-vyast pad-rachana, hin arth vaale shabd, bhavadambar or shabdaadambar, avaanchit sankshiptata, anaavashyak saaj-sajja, sangeet va lay par atyadhik bal aadi ko udaatt kaa virdohi tatva mana he
 Therefore, the best poet should not place them in his composition
 yah style kaa baari dosha he
 'baleya' literally means 'childish'
 bacchon main jaise chapaltaa, sanyamheenata, halkaapan or kshudrata pai jaati he, vaise hi baleyata kaa dosha us style main mana jayega
 In which to perform the eloquence without restraint, the use of words denoting petty meaning and playful or unstable footsteps
 isamen style kritrim ho jaati he
 According to Longinus- bhav kii garima ke abhaav main alankrita or baari shabdon kaa prayog
 Such as the use of the word 'living samadhi' for a small substance like a deer
 vagadambar udaatt atikaraman ke prayaas se utpann hota he
 Where the author behaves like a drunkard, he often expresses unexpected, meaningless and inconsistent impulses, ie impulse to be expressed even when impulse control is required
 aaveg kii abhivyakti bhavadambar ko janm detii he or udaatt kaa hraas karti he
 The exaggerated statement is rhetoric in the fascination of influencing people
 hindi main bihari ke oohatmak dohe isi dosha se grast hai
 For example, Longinus is of the opinion that the use of the words 'eye-eye' for women, 'chakshu-podak' and 'eye-virgin' for 'effigy' is mere rhetoric, not a metaphor of language
 parvarti samikshakon main higel ne udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye uski tulana soundarya se kii he
 According to him, beauty means harmony
 soundarya main vastu or kala paksh kaa saamanjasy rahata he
 Sublime situation is different from beautiful
 udaatt vah he jahaan uskaa bhav uske rup kii apeksha adhik prashast or vilsht hota he
 Hegel also believes that at the core of the sublime is the excellence of ideas and that the importance of ideas is born from a person's high character
 vyakti kaa charitra mahaan he to uske vichaar bhi mahaan honge
 Edmund Burke clarified the nature of the sublime on the basis of the genius-enriched imagination and the vastness of thought, etc
, by Longeus, that the object or creation has the power to influence and which can surprise the observer with its innovative effect That is, one should understand the sublime
 udaatt-tatva kii rachana kaa udhaaharan ham pyramid tathaa ramcharitra-maanas ke sundar kand main prastut hanuman ke viraat rup, mahabharat main krishna ke viraat rup aadi ko le sakate hai
 Burke has also accepted within the sound of sublime substances such as heavy thunderstorms, huge falls, lightning thunder, howls of cannons also have sublimate elements
 vastutah soundarya kii apeksha akkhadpan udaatt se adhik nikat hai
 Anand's reputation as a poet-work is such a gift of Longines that distinguishes him on the one hand from a rhetorician like Horace and on the other from a poetess like Aristotle
 arestu kaa virechan ek prakaar kaa upachaar he, jisaki pariklpana visheshkar traasadee ke sandarbh main kii gai he, jabaki lonzinus kaa ‘anand’ ek uplabdhi he, jiskaa poshak aadhaar mahakavy traasadee, pragit aadi sabhi tak vistrut hai
 In fact, the sublime has been discussed and analyzed the most in the 'peri Ipsus' of Longines
 lonzinus kaa udaatt siddhanth paashchaatya samiksha kii dein he
 His 'sublime' is an expression of the earned side of life, there is no place for the sweet side
 atah jivan ke aadhe paksh kaa vivechan karne ke kaaran unka shaastra adhuraa he
 Where is the perfection of Indian poetry, which also has the melody with oz
 ek ore vir or adbhut ras he to duusari ore shringaar or hasya ras hai
 He is a complete human work
 lonzinus kii dharna main is ekangita kaa kaaran yah he ki usne apane granth kii rachana bhaashan-shaastra ke rup main kii thi, kavyashastra ke rup main nahin
 That is why the interpretation of important elements for successful speech is found in it

 Anant means that there is no end

 It is a concept in mathematics and philosophy that says an amount that has no limit or end

 The English synonym of the word infinity "infinity" is the treaty of 'inn' and 'finis' in the Latin language
 yah shabd un raashiyon ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he jinaki bhaap athwa gananaa unke parimit na rahane ke kaaran asambhav he
 The infinite straight line length is borderless and therefore infinite
 ganitiya vishleshan main prachlit "anant" is prakaar vyakt kiya gaya he: If z is a variable and f is a function of Z, and if the variable is now moving towards a number, then f is increasing in such a way that it becomes larger and becomes larger than each given number
 No matter how large the loan is, it is said that the limit of f for z = a is infinite
 bhinnon kii paribhaasha se spasht he ki bhinn va / sa vah sankhya he jo sa se guna karne par gunanfal va detii he
 If neither of the z is zero, then the / c represents a unique amount
 phir spasht he ki 0 / sa sadaiv samaan rahata he, chaahe sa koi bhi saant sankhya ho
 This rational number is called zero and is equal to the countable number 0
 vipareetat:, va / 0 ek arthhin pad he
 It is a mistake to consider it infinite
 yadi k / ya main k achar rahata he or ya ghatata jaataa he or k, ya donon dhanatmak hai, to k / ya kaa maan badhata jayega
 If z leads to zero, eventually a / y will be larger than any larger number
 cantre ne anant kii samasya ko duusare dhang se vyakt kiya he
 Cantary numbers, which are sometimes called past numbers due to the contrast of the infinite and the infinite, are different from the definition of infinity prevalent in geometry and boundary theory
