 acupankchar chikitsakon ke naidanik abhyaas main, marij aksar, kuch khaas prakaar kii anubhuti hone kii baat karte hai jo is ilaaj ke saath judy hui he: The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture stated: "acupuncture has had the most success and acceptance in the treatment of bone-muscular pain in the United States
 " ve kehete hai ki acupankchar ko suchi main neeche di gai sthitiyon ke liye ek poorak chikitsa ke rup main mana ja saktaa he or kaha: "adhikansh sanketon ke samarthan main pustaken yaa kam se kam 1 jarnal lekh he
 But, definitive conclusions based on research findings are rare because the research situation in acupuncture is not good, but is improving "
 acupankchar karrwai ke shaareerik tantra kaa pataa karne ke liye kai anumaanon ko prastaavit kiya gaya he
 The gate-control theory of pain stated that the pain concept is not a direct result of the activation of pain fibers but is an interaction between stimulation and inhibition of these pain pathways
 siddhant ke anusaar, dard ke maarg par nirodhatmak karrwai ke dwaara dard niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 That is, the perception of pain can be changed in many ways, by physiology, by psychology, or by medicine
 dwaar-niyantran siddhant, acupankchar se swatantra mastishk tantrika vigyaan main viksit kiya gaya, jise baad main 1976 main german mastishk-chikitsak ne brain stem jalidaar gathan main acupankchar ke dardanivarak karrwai kii dharna ke liye jimmedaar mana
 This results in neuroharamon endogenous through the release of the principle central control spinal cord) or blockade pain on the periphery cord ie, the lower central brain kuch adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki acupankchar kii dardanivarak kriya, mastishk main prakritik endorphin kii rihaai ke saath judy he
 This effect can be understood by blocking the action of endorphins, for which a drug called naloxone can be used
 jab naloxon rogi ko di jaati he, to afim ke dardanivarak prabhaav ko kam kiya ja saktaa he, jisase marij dard ke ek adhik str ko mahasoos karegaa
 When naloxone is given to an acupuncture patient, the analgesic effect of acupuncture can also be reversed and the patient reports a high level of pain
 yah dhyaan diya janaa chahie tathaapi, ki samaan prakriyaaon kaa upyog karne vaale adhyayanon ne, naloxon dene kii kriya sahit, kootabheshaj pratikriya main antarjaat opioids kii bhoomika kaa suzav diya he or darshaya ki yah pratikriya acupankchar ke liye adwitiya nahin he
 In a study conducted on monkeys that directly recorded neural activity in the brain's thalamus, it was found that acupuncture's analgesic effect lasted for more than an hour
 iske alaava, tantrika tantra or acupankchar trigar binduon ke bich mayophesial dard syndrome main adhivyapan he 
 Evidence suggests that sites of analgesic action associated with acupuncture include the thalamus and PET using fmri, brain imaging techniques, and electrophysiological recording of neural impulses of neurons in the cerebral, direct cortex via the feedback pathway, which stimulates acupuncture
 Shows preventive action when applied
 kootabheshaj pratikriya ke falswaroop isi tarah ke prabhaavon ko dekha gaya he
 a study using fmri found that the deciduous analgesic was associated with reduced activity in the thalamus, insula, and the advance cingulate cortex

 The same problem arises in the double-blinding procedure used in bio-medicine, which includes almost all surgical procedures, dentistry, physical therapy, as the Institute of Medicine states: Controlled trials of surgical procedures have been done less frequently than studies of medications because it is much more difficult to standardize the process of surgery
 Surgery depends to some degree on the skills and training of the surgeon and the specific environment and support team available to the surgeon
 a surgical procedure in the hands of a highly skilled, experienced surgeon is different from the same procedure in the hands of an inexperienced and unskilled surgeon


 For many CAM modalities, it is similarly difficult to separate the effectiveness of the treatment from the effectiveness of the person providing the treatment
:126 In acupuncture, physician blindness remains a challenge

 Weak physiologic activity of superficial or sham needle penetration is suggested by several lines of research, including rcts showing larger effects of a superficial needle penetrating acupuncture than those of a nonpenetrating sham control, positron emission tomography research indicating that sham acupuncture can stimulate regions of the brain associated with natural opiate production, and animal studies showing that sham needle insertion can have nonspecific analgesic effects through a postulated mechanism of “diffuse noxious inhibitory control”
 Indeed, superficial needle penetration is a common technique in many authentic traditional Japanese acupuncture styles

 Scientists agree that an evidence-based medical framework should be used to evaluate health outcomes and that systematic reviews, including strict protocols, are mandatory
 cochraine sahyog or bandolier jaise sanghathan aisi samikshaayen prakashit karte hai

 Criticism of this treaty can be seen under the following points- 1

 Germany was not accommodated in the conference when drafting the treaty
 yah mitra rashtron kaa aadesh tha jise sweekaar karne ke atirikt germany ke samaksh koi doosraa upaay nahin tha
 They were also threatened by the German representatives, if they did not sign the treaty within five days, they would be attacked again

 This is the reason why Germany later turned down the treaty provisions

 In Churchill's words, "its economic conditions were stigmatized and ill-informed to the extent that they made it manifestly meaningless
" ” 4
 The treaty was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft: The treaty was not only unusually harsh, but it was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft
 tathakthith yuddh aparaadh sambandhi praavdhaanon germany dwaara sweekrut karaane kaa praytn yatharth se pare tha kyonki jaisaa david thamsan ne kaha “is baat kaa ullekh aise masaude main shaamil karke jis par hastakshar karne ke liye german pratinidhi vivash kiye gaye naiki uttardaayitv kii bhaavana utpann nahin kar sakate the
 “the second compensation was also demanded in improbable amounts and its huge amount was fixed without any serious consideration
 aarthik drushti se yah sampada germany ke liye chukaana tathaa mitra rashtron ke liye praapt karnaa kaise sambhav hoga, iskaa vishleshan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Undoubtedly, the entire size of the punishment and compensation was inconsiderate and impractical
 uparyukt sabhi prakaar kii anaavashyak kathorataayen germany ke rashtriya asantosh va krodh ko abhivyakti karne kii uski kshamta ke viruddh koi pruthak kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 This treaty was unfairly soft, it was hardly appropriate to rule the 'essence region' by the League of Nations for 15 years and return it to Germany in 1935
 rinland par 15 varsh tak mitra rashtron kaa adhikaar bhi khokhla siddh hua
 5
 Retaliatory Treaty: The conquering nations imposed harsh terms on Germany by adopting a vengeful attitude
 france apni puraani paraajay or ampan kaa badla lenaa chaah rahaa tha us drushti se sandhi main germany ke saath adhiktam kathor praavdhaan kiye gaye
 6
 Abusive Treaty: This treaty was a cause of national humiliation for Germany
 kaisar wiliam kii apadasta, baari kshati purti raashi kii vasuuli
 Allied states' authority on German shores, Karkhono, rivers, etc
, and the presence of armies in Germany, the division of Germany, the plunder of the colonies by friendly countries and discriminatory, unequal, unjust conditions, etc
 were all derogatory
 sandhi patron par hastakshar ke liye aane vaale german pratinidhiyon ke saath klemensho kaa abhadra vyavhar, unhen kaidiyon ke saamaan rakhana, janata dwaara gaaliyaan, sade hue fal, inte,pathar ko un par phekna adi pratinidhiyon kaa apmaan nahin balki germany kaa apmaan tha

 Treacherous Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw was considered morally unfair and treacherous to Germany
 germany ne wilson ke 14 sutron ke aadhaar par yuddh kar sandhi karnaa sweekaar kiya tha lekin varsay kii sandhi main wilson ke in sutron kaa khuleam ulanghan hua tha
 The principle of nationalism was not followed with Germany
 us par bahut si sharte lad di gai thi
 But the winners are exempt from that
 wilson ke tisare sutara ke anusaar anterrashtriya vyapaar kii samast rukawate dur karne kaa praytn karnaa tha, kintu germany kii samuhik swtantraa surakshit nahin thi
 His international trade remained under the control of the Allies for years
 14 sutron main sabhi rashtron ke shastron ke kami karne kaa suzav diya gaya tha, kintu mitra rashtron ne apane shastron main kami kiye bina germany kii sainik shakti ko atyant simit kar diya
 The Allies followed Wilson's 14 sources to the same extent as he benefited
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi main germany ke saath vishwasghaat kiya gaya
 To further avenge this betrayal, Germany went to war
 8
 sandhi ke pranetaon main vaicharik sangharsh : varsay kii sandhi ne teen bado ke vichaara or uddeshyon main sangharsh kii sthiti maujuud thi
 There was opposition between Wilson's high but impractical view, between Climenso's nationalist and realist demands, and Lloyd George's opportunistic motives, despite their agreement on the Treaty of Warsaw that reflected their imperialist and exploitative mentality
 logsan ke anusaar “wilson ke adarshavaad or sammelan ke bhautikwaad main teevr virodh tha or zyaadaatar maamalon main bhautikwaad vijayi rahaa
 " 9
 sanghash ke naye daur kii shuruuaat : varsay kii sandhi ne europea rashtron ke bich vishwavyapa satta ke liye nae sangharsh kii shuruuaat kii
 Until 1919, international law believed in the distinction between the property of a country's government and its citizens
 kintu varsay kii sandhi ke anusaar yuddhrat desh apane tathaa apane mitra rashtron kii seemaa main kisi shatru desh ke vyakti kii kisi prakaar kii sampati jabt kar saktaa tha
 If he was victorious in the war, he could force the government of the defeated country to compensate for its citizens' confiscated property
 yah ek nayaa drushtaant tha
 10
 Hatred towards the Weimar Republic: After the war, the Weimar Republic was established in Germany and was seen to be associated with the Treaty of Warsaw
 tamaam udaaravaadi visheshtaon ke bich ise shatru paksh dwaara sthapit sanstha mana gaya
 Therefore, in Germany, democracy became a system of dualism, hateful and hostile
 11
 aatmanirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa : italy kii simaaen rashtrawaad ke siddhant par nirdhaarit nahin kii gai, na hi poland kii bhoomi par sabhi naagarik nirvivaadit rup se pole the
 Similarly, parts of the Turkish Empire were not promised sovereignty
 rashtrasang vishaal va laghu rajyon ke samaan raajnneetik samprabhutaa dilaane main asamarth rahaa
 Regarding the moral aspect and tactical compatibility of this treaty, AJP Taylor states that "from the beginning the Treaty of Warsaw lacked moral recognition
" germany ke vishay main aatm nirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa kii gai
 Many nations of Europe were reorganized according to President Wilson's principle of self-determination
 isse anusaar ek hi raashtra jati, ek hi bhashaa evam saanskrithik parampara vaale logon ko milakar unka pruthak tantra banane kaa nishchay kiya gaya
 On this basis, independent states of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia were born
 kintu is siddhant kaa germany, austria or hungary ke sambandh main paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Thousands of German citizens were separated from the German Empire and subjugated to other states
 ” 1918 i
 main jab austria ke germanon ne german-austria ganatantr kii sthapana kii or german ke ganatantr ke saath sammilit hone va land ko milaane kii ichha vyakt kii tab mitra rajyon dwaara sitambar 1919 i
 main donon rajyon ke sammilan par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Thus the German citizens were disappointed by not implementing the principle accepted by the Allies about Germany
 butlerane anusaar “aatmanirnay ke siddhant kaa yuktiyukt prayog na karnaa paris kii vyavastha main antarnihit kamajori kaa dyotak tha
 " vishwa itihaas ke jin ek sandhiyon or uske prabhaavon kii sarvaadhik charchaa hui he, unamem varsay kii sandhi kaa vishisht sthaan he
 Critics have defined it as the cause of World War II in terms of the harsh provisions of that treaty and its form
 unke anusaar varsay kii sandhi shanti kii vyavastha na hokar asantosh kii janak thi
 Just after 20 years, 2 months and 4 days after the treaty, this world was hit by the Second World War
 sandhi hone ke baad se hi uski vyavasthaaon ko germany dwaara bhang kiya jaataa rahaa
 At the same time amendments were also made to the treaty provisions
 in sandhi praavdhaanon ke ulalanghanon evam sanshodhano ne sansar ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii ore dhakel diya
 The treaty provisions were violated and amended because it was too harsh and abusive
 aisi kathor evam apmanjanak sandhi kii sharton ko koi bhi swabhimani raashtra ek lambey samay tak bardaasht nahin kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, it was clear that Germany would try to get rid of the system imposed by the Versailles Treaty and wash away the stigma of humiliation as soon as the above opportunities are given in future
 germany kii catholic centre party ke agerburger kaa viraam sandhi ke samay vaktavy tha ki "german jati ksht sahegi parantu maregi nahin
 "naturally, Germany made a successful attempt to wash away these derogatory terms
 parinamswaroop kuch hi varshon main europe kaa raajnneetik vaataavaran atyant ashaant ho gaya or vishwa ko pratham mahayuddh se bhi adhik bhayankar or pralayankari yuddh dekhnaa padaa
 Even according to France's Marshal Fouche "this treaty is not peace, only a 20-year ceasefire
" " spasht he ki isi sandhi main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej vidyaman the
 At the time of the treaty in 1919, Germany was helpless and had no choice but to quietly accept the treaty but as time passed, it began to breach the terms of the treaty by accumulating some power and the treaty makers also Made amendments
 1926 main jab germany ko rashtrasang kii sadsyta di gai tab sandhi ke pratham bhaag main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 The seventh part of the war criminals was never fully implemented
 german samraat wiliam kaisar sahit anek yuddh aparaadhiyon ko dand na dekar mahaj kuch ek ko saamaanya dand die gaye
 The provision relating to compensation was first amended and later abandoned altogether
 lojaan sammelan main kshatipurti ke prashn ko hi samaapt kar diya gaya
 After Hitler's rise to German politics in 1933–34, breaking the terms of Warsaw became a minor thing
 1935-36 main hitler ne sandhi ke nihshastreekaran se sambandhit praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan kar senaaon main vruddhi kii or 1936 main rinland par adhikaar kar liya
 In March 1938, Hitler dissolved the provisions of the territorial arrangements of the Treaty of Warsaw by combining Austria with Germany and September 1938 in Czechoslovakia
 jab hitler ne varsay sandhi dwaara nirmit poland se sambandhit polish galiyare evam danging bandargah sambandhi vyavasthaaon ko todane ke uddeshy se poland par akraman kiya to dwitiya vishwayuddh prarambh ho gaya
 To break the unjust arrangements of the Versailles Treaty, Hitler started a series of events that led to the outbreak of the Second World War
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi praavdhaanon ke unmoolan kii prakriya kii antim parinti dwitiya vishwayuddh ke aarambh main hui
 From this point of view, the seeds of World War II can be seen in the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch aalochak maanate hai ki varsay sandhi kii kathor sharte nahin balki unako kriyanvit karne kii dhilaai dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa kaaran bani
 According to logsm is prakaar isamen koi andeh nahin ki varsay kii anyaaypurna kathor or apmanjanak sandhi, ek seemaa tak dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke liye uttaradaayi thi
 But it is also true that the conflicting policy of the Allies, neglect, indifference, appeasement and the policy of not strictly enforcing the terms of the treaty were also no less responsible for it

 durchitr photography yaa 'durchitran' yaa 'telephotography' vidyut sanketon dwaara chitron ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par bhejne kii vidhi he
 In 1843, Wayne first attempted to send drawings by wire to England
 photo ko taar se bhejne kaa sarvapratham prayaas germany ke corn ne san 1902 main kiya tha
 He got the picture on film at the receiving center
 san 1908 main ye chitra kai sau mile tak bheje ja sakate the
 In the modern era, the advancement in the method of sending news has also led to substantial advancement in telegraphy
 durchitran kaa siddhant televijan ke chitra bhejne ke siddhant se bahut saadrishy rakhata he
 The sender has to send a picture to the center to be mounted on a cylinder
 ab prakashakiran dwaara is chitra kaa kramavikshan kiya jaataa he
 The cylinder rotates at a speed of about 100 revolutions per minute
 is belan par prakashakiran daali jaati he, jo chitra se paravartit hokar ek prakashavidyut cell yaa photocel par padati he
 The light intensity increases by about 2,400 times a second before falling on the image
 isko vaahak aavriti sankhya kehete hai
 The intensity of the reflected light from the picture is also less than the blackness of the picture
 is prakaar prakashakiran kii tivrata par vaahak aavritisankhya ke atikti ek anya aavriti kaa modulan hota he, jo chitra ke kaalepan ke anuroop hota he
 This ray of light moves one inch in a minute parallel to the cylinder's axis, that is, from the top of the picture towards the bottom
 itane samay main belan 100 chakkar lagaataa he
 This allows the photo to be scanned according to 100 lines in an inch
 photo se paravartit hokar prakashakiran, jab prakaash-vidyut-cell par padati he, tab is cell se prakaash kii tivrata ke anuroop modulit vidyut sanket praapt hote hai
 These signals are amplified and transmitted over the line by the sender
 grahi centre par jab ye sanket praapt hote hai, tab pehle inhen pravardhit kiya jaataa he
 The carrier frequency is then separated from these by demodulation
 is prakaar praapt vidyutanketon ko pun: pravardhit kiya jaataa he
 When these amplified signals are delivered to an electric light source, the intensity of light emanating from this source changes
 prakaash kii tivrata main yah parivartan bilkul usee prakaar hota he, jaisaa preshak centre par chitra se parivartit prakaash main tha
 a cylinder also rotates at the receiving center, whose size and rotation speed is exactly like the cylinder at the sending center
 is belan par ek photographikeey film chadhi rahati he
 The light generated from the above source is focused on this cylinder
 is prakaash kiran dwaara belan par sarpilaakaar rekhaayen ankit ho jaati hai
 The blackness of the lines depends on the intensity of light
 is tarah film par us chitra kii chaaya aa jaati he, jise preshak centre se preshit kiya gaya tha
 Here it is very important that the speed of rotation of the cylinders at the sender center and receiver center is exactly the same
 iske liye donon kendron par ek se swaritra dvibhuj dwaara belanon ko ghumaanevaale motaron kii gati niyantrit kii jaati he
 It is also essential that the sender and receiver center start simultaneously from the upper end of the photo mounted on the scanning cylinder
 iske liye prayek chitra prarambh karne ke samay ek sanket preshit kiya jaataa he, jo dono kendron par kramavikshan aarambh kar detaa he

 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar 
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated ---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 jaise jaise sanyabhiyaan main prithviraj kii vijay hoti gai, vaise vaise sena main bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 In the Narayan war, Prithviraj's army consisted of 200,000 cavalry soldiers, five hundred yards, many soldiers

 But how much were they? Which state had princesses? This is not mentioned there
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullekh he ki, prithviraj jab gyaarah varshiya the, tab unka prapratham vivaah hua tha
 After that, they got married every year until Prithviraj was twenty-two years old
 uske pashchaat prithviraj jab chhattis varshiya hue, tah unka antim vivaah sanyogita ke saath hua
 Prithviraj's first marriage was to Jambhavati, daughter of Nahad Rao Padihar of Mandore region

 They are as follows - Jambhavati, Ichni, Yadavi Shashivrata, Hansavati and Sanyogita

 The capital of that region was Ahichhatrapur
 sadyah uskaa naam nagaur he
 That Nagaur city is famous today as Deshnok
 deshnok nagar bikaner se uttar disha main 32 kimi dur sthit he
 Janglu village is sixteen km away from Deshnok
 vahaan se 1233 vikram sanvatsar main likhit ek shilaalekh praapt hota he
 According to that inscription, that village was named Jangkupadurg and Ajaypur in ancient times
 1176 vikram sanvatsar main likhit ek shilaalekh main ullikhit he ki, jangkupadurg naamak gram kii sthapana prithviraj pratham dwaara hui thi
 The currencies of the name of Prithviraj were also obtained from that village
 jangalakupadurg gram kii sthapana ke pashchaat kuch dinon main hi gazani pradesh ke raja arsalan dwaara jangalakupadurg gram ko dhwast kiya gaya

 ek baar apane rakshakon ke saath prithviraj ko milane ke liye vah ajayameru nagar ja rahi thi
 On the way comes the demolished Janglu village
 us dhwast gram ko dekh kar vah duhkhi ho gai
 After that he created a new village in the same land
 us gram kaa naam ajiapur tha
 Ajia Prithviraj was going to meet Prithviraj, but Prithviraj also went to the forest of Janglu state with the excuse of hunting
 ve ajia ko apni rajdhani le gaye
 After that both of them were married
 prithviraj raso kavy main 'padmavatisamayah' naamak aakhyaan bhi prapya he
 According to Rasokavya, in the east there was a region called Samudrasikh
 vahaan yadav vansheey ke vijaypal naam raja kaa shashan tha
 His wife's name was Padmasen
 un donon kii putree padmavati thi
 Padmavati was wandering in the garden of the Raj Bhavan one day
 us samay uske dwaara ek shuk ko dekha gaya
 That hook was very attractive
 vah shuk bhi padmavati ke rakt adhar ko bimbafal maan kar use khaane ke liye aage badhaa
 At the same time, Padmavati took Shuk in her hand
 vah shuk maanav bhashaa kaa gyaata tha
 He used to narrate many stories to entertain Padmavati
 uske pashchaat padmavati ne jigyasaavash shuk ko puchha ki, "he shukraj ! aap kahan nivas karte hai? aapke rajya kaa raja koun he?" tab padmavati kii jigyaasa ke upshman ke liye shuk ne vistaar purvak apane rajya or prithviraj kaa varnan aarambh kiya

 He has descended on the earth like Cupid, having completed fourteen arts
 shuk ke mukh se prithviraj kii prashansa sun kar yadav kumari padmavati kaa man prithviraj ke prati anurakt ho gaya
 But Padmavati, who attained youth, had been married by Vijayapala to Kumudamani
 kumudmani kumaun pradesh kaa raja tha
 The princess was getting married in the sea region
 dusri ore apane vivaah ke samachar sunakar padmavati vyakul thi
 After that she said to Shuk, "O kir! Shuk! You soon go to Delhi and call my dear Prithviraj here"
 uske pashchaat padmavati ne shuk ko ek patr diya
 Hey Kshatriya Kulbhushan! i love you with my whole heart
 yadi aap mujhe or mere kul ko varanyogy maanate hai, to meraa panigrahan kar ke mere praanon kii raksha karen
 My marriage is fixed on the Shukladvadashi date of Vaishakhamas of 1130 Shakasamvatsara
 atah usase purv aakar shrikrishna ne jaise rukmini kaa haran kiya tha, vaise hi meraa haran kar ke mujhe krutharth karen
 --- Padmavati shuk ne vayuveg se dehali ja kar prithviraj ko patr diya
 After reading the letter, Prithviraj started the journey with the feudatories towards the sea city
 dusri ore kumudmani ne kumaun se varyatra prarambh kii
 On receiving the news that Prithviraj is going to sea, Muhammad Ghori also started the journey towards the sea
 uske pashchaat samudrashikhar ja rahe kumudmani ke aagaman kaa samachar sun kar padmavati ati vyakula ho gai
 Because he did not get news of Prithviraj's arrival
 atah vah prasaad ke vaatayan par baith kar maarg ko vihval man se dekhati hui pratiksha karte hue ro rahi thi
 At the same time, Shuk came and said to him, "O beautiful! Shiva is in the temple nearest to you
 tum sheeghra hi vahaan joon"
 On hearing Shuk's words, the eyes of Padmavati who were revived suddenly shone
 naveen vastra dhaaran kar sugandhit jal se snaan kar shodash shringaar karke apni sakhion ke saath vah swarna sthalika main deep lekar shivalay gai
 After reaching Shivalaya, worshiping Shiva Parvati and went towards Prithviraj
 uske pashchaat apane mukhaawaran ko hataa kar vah mugdh ho kar prithviraj ke soundarya ko dekhati rahi
 Prithviraj also went a little further and stood near Padmavati
 mandir kaa vah drishy dekh kar padmavati kii sakhiyaan sashcharya chakit hokar padmavati ko or prithviraj ko dekh rahi thi
 Because no one knew about Padmavati and Prithviraj's love except Shuk-6
 uske pashchaat prithviraj ne padmavati kaa haath apane haath main lekhakar ashwarohan kiya
 As soon as the journey of Prithviraj and Padmavati towards Dehli began, the news of Padmavatiharan spread everywhere in Samudrashanagar
 vijaypal or kumudmani prithviraj ke saath yuddh karan ke liye prithviraj ke peeche gaye
 Upon hearing the news of the arrival of Vijayapala and Kumadamani, Prithviraj became adorned for a bitter battle
 uske pashchaat vinaashak yuddh main vijayi prithviraj ne dehali kii ore yatra armbh kii
 But on the way, Muhammad Ghori attacked Prithviraj with his soldiers
 parantu ghori kii sena kii ghor paraajay hui
 All his soldiers were migrating here and Prithviraj made Ghori a prisoner and traveled towards Dehli
 dehali pahunch kar durga ke mandir main shubhamuhoort main prithviraj ne padmavati ke saath vivaah kar liya
 Historians believe that from the literary point of view the story is important, but from the historical point of view that story is not important
 kyonki itihaas main kahin par samudrashikhar naamak durg kaa or uske raja vijaypal kaa ullekh prapya nahin he
 Both names are fictitious
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ye katha koi puraana kaaleen prasiddh katha hogi, jiskaa avlamban karke agyaat vyakti ne prithviraj raso kavy main prakshep kii hogi
 The second proof is that Chandbaradiyi has not composed the above story
 arthath 'top' dwaara choron disha main dhuaan ho gaya
 But in Indian history, the cannon was used in the battle of Panipat region on the twentieth day of April-month of 1526 years
 parantu jaganic rachit aalhakhand main baar baar topon ke upyog kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Although there is no historical fact in this story, yet the characters of Prithviraj and Padmavati are worthy in the story
 1236 vikram sanvatsar ke ashadhamas kii shukladashami buudhvaasar ko likhit ek shilaalekh pokaran se praapt hua he
 It mentions that, on the orders of Prithviraj, Mandleshwar named 'katia' donated a village called Pihilapaul in Lokeshwaramandir of Vijaypur
 gram ke saath tadaag, gram ke choro ore ke vishaal van bhi usne daan main diye the
 Padmavati was the daughter of a Paramaravanshi named Palhan
 katiya naamak mandaleshwar padmavati kaa bhai tha
 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that Chandravati, the princess of Chandrapundir region was married to Prithviraj
 us ke garbh se sapadalaksh samrajya kaa uttaradhikari ranasi samudbhoot hua
 History is of the opinion that, Rainsi is a fictitious name, in fact its name is Govind Aasit
 parantu chandrapundeer pradesh kii rajkumaari kaa vivaah prithviraj se hua thaye uchit hi he 
 In the Prithviraj Vijay epic, the name Tilottama, in the Prithviraj Raso Kavya, in the name Sanyogita, in the Surjan Charit epic, the name 'kantimati' is mentioned
 sanyogita kaa ullekh rambhamgajri mahakavy main or hammir mahakavy main praapt nahin hota
 The loss of coincidence was an important event in history
 us samay prithviraj kii veerta kii prashansa chaaro dishaao main ho rahi thi
 Once Sanyogita heard the description of Prithviraj's bravery and beauty
 uske pashchaat wo unhen prem karne lagi
 On the other hand, Sanyogita's father Jayachand announced to marry Sanyogita through a swayamvar
 jayachand ne ashwamedhyagy kaa aayojan kiya tha
 At the conclusion of that Yajna, there was a Muhurta for the Sanyamvar of Sanyogita
 jayachand ashwamedhyagy karke bharat par swapratishtha kaa ichha rakhata tha
 But Prithviraj opposed him
 atah jayachand ne prithviraj ko swayamvar main aamantrit nahin kiya or usne dwarpal ke sthaan par prithviraj kii pratimaa sthapit kar di
 On the other hand, when Sanyogita learned that Prithviraj would be absent in the Swayamvara, he sent messengers to summon Prithviraj
 sanyogita mujhe prem karti he ye jaan kar prithviraj ne kannauj nagar kii ore prasthaan kiya
 After the Ashwamedha Yajna, during the Swayamvara period, when Sanyogita was looking at the kings present with a garland in her hand, she saw the statue of Prithviraj at the door
 sanyogita ne murti ke sameep ja kar varmala prithviraj kii murti ke kanth main pahana di
 At the same time, Ashwarudh Prithviraj entered Prasad
 unhone singhnaad ke saath sabhi raajaaon ko yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 After that, Indrapastha departed after taking Sanyogita
 maarg main jayachand ko parajeet kar ke, mohammad ghori ko bandi bana kar prithviraj sanyogita ke saath indrapastha pahunche
 Jaichand fought with Prithviraj to retaliate his insult
 parantu mohammad ghori ne jab janaa ki, prithviraj kannauj nagar ki ore ja rahe hai, tab prithviraj ko parajeet karne ke liye usne maarg main avrodh utpann kiya tha
 Prithviraj not only defeated Muhammad Ghori, but also took him as a prisoner and took him to Indraprastha
 prithviraj jab shakambhari ke singhaasana par arurh hue, tab chouhan vansh kaa samrajya ke saamanton kii sahaayta se chalata tha
 In the feudal system of governance, all the feudal lords manage their treasury independently and provide a fixed sum of money to their emperor as an annual gift
 yudhkaal main samant samraat ke aagyaanusaar apni sena bhi bhejte hai
 The state of political unity is highly relaxed in the feudal system of governance
 kyonki jo sainik samraat ke aadesh se yuddh ke liye udyukt hote hai, unki nishtha apane raja ke prati hoti he, na ki apane samraat ke prati
 Feudal also have their desires
 atah wein apane prabhaav ke or kshetra ke vistaar ke liye nirantar praytn sheel hote hai
 When the emperor of the feudal is defeated in a battle, is dead or weak, then the feudal begins to try for his freedom
 samrat kii shithilataa kaa kaaran jaan kar wein, apane samrat ke upar akraman karne ke liye bhi tatpar hote hai
 Prithviraj was young on the throne, so many feudal lords declared war on their dreams of independence
 parantu kaimaas or bhunakamall kii sahaayta se karpurdevi ne un vidrohi samanton kaa daman kar diya
 Thus Nagarjuna, the second son of Vigraharaj revolted as the heir to the kingdom of Ajayameru
 prithviraj jab sattarum hue, tab yoginipur main nagarjun nirvasit jivan vyateet kar rahe the
 At that time Yoginipur was ruled by Matul Tomarvanshi Prithvi Pal of Nagarjuna
 tomaravansheey raja prithvipal bhi chouhan vansh kaa ek samant tha
 In the seventh and seventh verses of the tenth canto of the Prithviraj Vijay epic, it is mentioned that the fortunate, mighty Vigraharaj invaded Gujpur by the prudent son Nagarjuna
 tomaravansheey raja prithvipal ke paas utani sainyashakti nahin thi, jisase vah prithviraj par akraman kar sake
 But Prithvipal was also supported by a feudal named Yadavvanshi Bhadanak
 phir bhi un donon kii sammilit sena bhi prithviraj ke 70,000 ashwarohi sainikon kaa, gajasainika kaa or padaation kaa saamana karne main asamarth thi
 Harihar Niwas Dwivedi is of the opinion that Jejakbhukti, the eastern reclusive kingdom of the Sapdalaksha kingdom and the kingdom of Kanyakubj also provided Prithvipal with military support to fight against Prithviraj
 shakambhari ke chouhan vansh kaa bayaanpradeshy yadavavanshiyon ko saath prapratham baar yuddh ajayraj ke kaal main hua thaa
 The fifteenth verse in the Bijaulia inscription mentions that Ajayraj was slaughtered by Srimarga and the heroes of Chachig, Singhul, and Yashodhar, etc
 during the campaign period of Durda Pradesh
 uske pashchaat arnoraaj or vigraharaj ne bhi bayaanpradeshy yadavavanshiyon ke saath kiye the
 But they did not succeed in completely destroying the Yadavas
 prithviraj ke viruddh yada nagarjun ne vidroh kiya, tababhadanak pradeshy raja sohanpal chouhan vansh ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye sajj hua
 Therefore, he helped Nagarjuna with his military force
 sohanpal ke purvaj kumarpal ke saath vigraharaj ne yuddh kiya tha 
 The state of genetic warfare emerged in the reign of Prithviraj
 parantu prithviraj ne bhadanak pradesh ke yadavavanshiyon kaa samul uchhedan kar diya
 Prithviraj made two important changes in his system of governance after the invasion of Bhadanak region
 prapratham to honcipur ke samant ko padchyut karke apane bhai hariraj ko haansidurg ke samant ke rup main niyukt kiya
 In the second assignment, he appointed Govind in Prithipal's vacancy at Yoginipur
 evam yuddh ke mukhya do kendron kii paryaapt rakshan vyavastha karke apane virodhiyon ke shadyantra kaa pratyuttar dene ke liye prithviraj sajj ho gaye
 Information is obtainable on page 14 of the Khartargachhapattavali that, Prithviraj is famous in the Narayan region for the Digvijay campaign
 ) apni sena kaa sanghatan kiya
 Bhuvannackamall himself was guiding and operating the troops and officers
 prithvaaraj ne sainya sajjataa ke anantar shatru pradesh ke nirikshan ke liye bhuvanakamall ke netritv main ek dal ko aage bheja
 After that, with his generals, he started the Digvijay campaign with his huge army
 prithviraj ke senapatiyon main kaimaas or skanda pramukh the
 At that time major cities like Bayana, Alwar, Bhiwani, Rivadi etc
 used to be included in Bhadanak region
 us pradesh kii purv seemaa ke sameep main yamunanadi or dakshin seemaa ke sameep main chambalnadi pravaahit hoti thi
 Twenty-two km from the town called Bayana
 dur tribhuvangarh naamak nagar bhadaanak pradesh kii rajdhani tha
 Prithviraj invaded Bhadanak region from all directions
 us bhayankar yuddh main yadavavanshi sohanpal parajeet hua
 Prithviraj and his army established suzerainty over Sohanpal

 us yuddh ke anantar sapadalaksh samrajya kii purvasimaa main yamunanadi or dakshinpurv disha main chambalnadi pravaahit hone lagi
 The description of the remarkable victory made over the Bhadanak region is attainable in the Khartargachhapattavali in this way - dipra praas prahar ghattatat prast muktavlibhih
nunan bhadanakiyain ranbhuvi karibhih swaastikeyury tochcheh
 Prithvirajasya Satyasubal Mahasah: Who himself is the alphabet 29॥ he prithviraj ! aapke parakram or yash kaa varnan kin shabd main kar sakate hai? jinaki sena ne chaaro disha se vijayadevi ko prasann kiya
 The one who established the dominance of the opponents with Arjun Bhujbal should have a swastika symbol
 jejakabhukti pradesh ke chedidesh, dasharn, jujhoti, kuntaldesh ityadi naamaantar bhi hai
 Sadly: Jejak Bhukthi region is known in the room of Bundelkhand
 yadhyapi bundelkhand kaa vishaal bhubhag madhyapradesh or uttarapradesh rajya ke madhya vibhakt ho gaya he, tathaapi vah pradesh bundelkhand naam se hi prasiddh he
 In that Bundelkhand, there was an independent kingdom called Jejakabhukti
 jejakabhukti pradesh kii uttar seemaa main yamunanadi, uttarpashchim disha main chambalnadi bahati thi
 Bundelkhand had a hill in the southeast direction
 jejakabhukti pradesh kii saanskrithik rajdhani khajuraho thi
 Jejajbhukti had two strategic centers in the state
 prapratham to mukhyarajdhani kalinger-nagar or dwitiya mahobagarh-nagar
 The creation of the Jejak bhakti state was very bizarre
 sarvatra laghu durg the
 Kalinjar, Ajaygarh, Barigarh, Mahoba, Madfa etc
 were important fortifications among them
 1182 varsh main prithviraj ne jejakabhukti par akraman kiya
 Enemies stunned by Prithviraj's invasion were defeated in battle
 pahujanadi ke tat par sthit sirsadurg main salkhan naamak senapati niyukt tha
 Kaimash killed him
 salkhan ke malakhan naamak ek bhai kaa bhi vadh kaimash ne kiya
 As soon as Prithviraj's army was marching towards a place called Akori, as soon as Sirsadurga, there was a fierce battle with Chandreryasena on the way
 aalha naamake paramardidev kaa yoddha us yuddh main parajeet hua
 So he took refuge in the forest
 brahmajit naamak yoddha us yuddh main hutatma hua
 After this, the invasion of Prithviraj led to the famous commander of Paramardidev
 swayan paramardidev chandel yuddh se vimukh ho kar kaalanzirdurg main guptavas karne laga
 But Prithviraj attacked Kalanjirdurg from all directions and forced Paramardidev to surrender
 prithviraj jab apni sena ke saath malwapradesh ke airan naamak sthaan ke paas sthit madanpur ke shibir main the, tabparamardidev ke aatmasamarpan kaa samachar unako mila
 It is mentioned in the Prabandhchintamana of Merutunga that, "paramardeva installed the trinity in his mouth, that is, by showing greatness, he got the living from Prithviraj"
 prithviraj ke jejakabhuktivijay kaa samarthan shilaalekh bhi karte hai

 shlo
 8, bhaag 1, sharngdharapaddatih That is, there is a melancholy in the worship of Shiva, there is no craving in Krishnarchan, do not bow down to Durgako, and the planet Vyagara in the form of a vidha whose our lord Paramardidev was installed in the trunk mouth succeeded in getting life from Narpati Prithviraj
 prithviraj kii jejakabhuktipradesh kaa abhiyaan safal hua
 But that campaign was incomplete
 kyonki jejakabhuktipradesh kii rani paramardidev kii putree nikidevi chalukyasamrat kii mulrajadwitiya kii mata tha
 Naikidevi Kushal was a political policy
 atah usne apane pita ke paraajay kii sthiti ko jaan kar prithviraj kaa dhyanchut karne ke liye ajayameru samrajya par akraman karavaaya
 In diplomacy, she became successful in her campaign
 yada prithviraj ne ajmeru samrajya ke upar akraman ke samachar sune, tabavah jejakabhuktipradesh ke anypradeshon kaa abhiyaan sthagig kar ajayameru pradesh kii ore chale gayi
 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that Paramaradeva, who was defeated in the war, committed murder
 parantu 1201 varsh main likhaa paramardidev kaa antim shilaalekh praapt hota he
 So till that year, his life event is confirmed
 prithviraj ke pita someshwar ke shasankaal main chalukyavanshiy ajaypal se someshwar ne anek ksht sahe the
 Prithviraj's army invaded Abu Pradesh at night
 parantu us abhiyaan kaa netritv prithviraj nahin kar rahe the
 Because Prithviraj was in Bhandanakpradesh and Jejak Bhakti pradesh for the Digvijay campaign
 madanpur se praapt 1239 vikram sanvatsar main likhit shilaalekh api isaki pushti karata he
 According to the Khartargachhapattavali, Prithviraj had gathered his army at Narayankshetra to start Digvijayabhiyan in 1239 Vikram Samvatsar
 prithviraj yada jejakabhuktipradesh ke vijayabhiyaan main the, tab prithviraj ko dhyanchut karne ke liye chalukyavanshiy bhimdevdwitiya ne ajmeru samrajya ke upar akraman kiya tha
 In that invasion, Bhimdev II had established the suzerainty of the Sapalaksh empire
 chalukyavanshiyon ke us abhiyaan kaa netritv jagaddev naamak adhikari ne kiya tha
 But that success was very short-lived
 bikaner nagar ke aagneyakon main sthit chhapar gram se 22 kimi dur sthit charlugram se jo do shilaalekh praapt hue, un shilalekhon main nagauryuddh kaa vivaran praapt hota he
 There is 1241 Vikram Samvatsar in them
 tatra nagaur sangram main jo veergati ko praapt hue, unke smritichihn sthapit kiye gaye hai
 There is a mention of the treaty of Tatrapi Chauhan and Chalukya dynasty like Khartargachhapattavali
 ukt tathyon ke aadhaar se spasht he ki, chalukya ke do senapati jagaddev or dharavarsh ko praarambhik kaal main chouhan vansh ke viruddh sainya safalataa mili or sapadalakshasamrajya ke bhubhag par aadhipaty praapt karne main ve do safal bhi hue
 But after that, the long-term war with the Chauhan dynasty led to the condition of the treaty
 khartargachhpattavali main ullekh he ki, prithviraj ke saath dirghakalinyudh se senapati jagaddev vipadgrast ho gaya tha
 Therefore, he made a treaty with Prithviraj
 jagaddev kisi bhi prakaar se prithviraj ke saath sandhi-satatya chahta tha
 The compulsion related to the treaty of Jagaddev can be known most often by a phenomenon described in Khartargachhapattavali
 khartargachhpattavali ke 43 prishth par likhaa he ki, 1244 vikram sanvatsar main sapadalakshasamrajya ke kuch shreshthi gujarat rajya gaye the
 Then Dandanayak named Abhayad planned to loot them
 apane dal ko bhi usne lunthankarya ke liye sajj kar diya
 But to do so much importance, permission of the Prime Minister is necessary, thinking that he wrote a letter to Jagaddev
 abhi yahan sapadalakshasamrajya ke dhanik shreshthion kaa ek mandal aayaa hua he
 With your permission can i loot them and make money? itnaa padhte hi jagaddev krodh se ugr ho uththe
 He wrote a response that, maine bahut ksht se abhi abhi prithviraj ke saath sandhi karne main safalataa praapt kii he
 Therefore, i warn you that, if you have afflicted any of the people of Sapalaksha, then i will sew you in the belly of the donkey
 ukt patr ko padh kar dandanayak ne un shreshthion kaa yogya satkar kar sakushal bhej diya
 Veravalprashasti also confirms this statement of Khartargachhapattavali
 jejakabhuktipradesh main yada prithviraj ne vijay praapt kii, tabanikidevi ke aadesh se chalukyavanshiy raja bhimdev ne ajayameru pradesh ke upar akraman kiya tha
 Therefore, Prithviraj Jejakabhukti had gone to war with the Chalukyan dynasty by postponing the Vijayabhayan of the other state
 prithviraj or bhimdev ke madhya dirghakaal paryant yuddh hua
 The war came to an end with the victory of Prithviraj in 1244 Vikram Samvatsar
 khartagargachhpattavali kaa vivaran, jaisalmer, nagaur, barmer or jodhpur se praapt shilaalekh or verawalprashasti prithviraj or bhimdev ke madhya ke yuprinaam kii paryaapt soochna dete hai
 Prithviraj Raso Kavya mentions that Prithviraj killed Bhimdev II
 parantu yadhyapi 1192 varsh main prithviraj kii mrityu ho gai thi, tathaapi bhimvedav dwitiya kii sthiti 1238 paryant thi aisa pramaanon se siddh hota he
 In 1175, Mohammad Ghori established the suzerainty over Multan, and in the same year he had established dominance over Uchha region
 uske pashchaat i
 1182 varsh main dakshin sindh pradesh ke upar akraman karke shaniah shaniah usne sindhupradesh par swadhipaty sthapit kiya
 From that, the extent of the kingdom of Sapadalakshtra and that of Sandhya Pradesh ruled by Ghori became the same
 evam ghori prithviraj kaa prativeshi or shatru ban baitha
 They both had their own reasons for hostility
 prithviraj apane pradesh kaa siimaarakshan karnaa chaahate the, parantu uske liye turk ke akrantaon ko peeche hataanaa anivaary tha
 On the other hand in the expansionary policy of Ghori, Prithviraj Kantak was similar
 kyonki bharat pradesh par sattavistaar ke liye prithviraj kaa ant hi ghori kaa lakshya tha
 It is mentioned in Prithvirajvijay that, in the northwestern direction, which is a state famous for the horses, the king of that region resides in the roaring country named Molechh Ghori
 turk deshiy us gaumansabhakshan karne vaale ke vishay main sun kar prithviraj ne mlecchon ke naash kii pratigya lee
 Ghori also knew about the promise of Mlachnash by Prithviraj
 atah usne i
 1177 varsh main ajayameru durg main apana doot bheja
 Thereafter, Takla envoy appeared in the Rajya Sabha of Ajayameru
 yada wo doot ajmeruprasaad main upasthit tha, tabaprasaad main nagarjunaman kaa utsav chal rahaa tha
 In order to write the praise of Kapilavadha by the creator, his forehead has been composed, etc
 From the sentences, the flat tuck of that messenger is derided in the epic of Prithviraj Vijay
 prithvirajvijay main aage ullikh he ki, uski daadhi ke, bhruvon ke or palak ke kesh uske pradesh kii drakshavat shwet varniya the
 His idols were destroyed
 arthath wo murdhanyavarnon ke uccharan main asamarth tha
 Therefore, his language was getting geniused under the tweet of the parties
 uski tvak kushtarogiwat dikh rahi thi
 He wore the strange clothes of Krishnavarna
 iske pashchaat prithvirajvijay mahakavy main kuch shloke praapt nahin hote
 Therefore, the purpose of the messenger's presence in Ajayameru's presidency is certainly not known
 parantu doot ke vachan sunakar prithviraj ne yada pratyuttar diya, ve shloke uplabdh hai
 Hearing the words of the messenger, Prithviraj had a terrible reaction
 atyant krodh se ucch swar main prithviraj ne bolaa, "main use kya boluun? wo nishchay se jaanata he ki, maine uske sadrush narbhakshak kii hatya karne ke liye hi vijayabhiyaan kaa armbh kiya he
 Even knowing this, he sends messengers to me, whom people refer to as "ajayameru's lion"
 prithviraj ke ukt krodhpurna vachan se ghori ke sandesh kaa anumaan hi kar sakate hai
 Historians believe that Ghori would have sent a message to Prithviraj either for surrender or for a treaty, as was the political situation in that period
 ghori ke darp se purna prastaav sunakar prithviraj ne us prastaav ko asweekaar kiya hoga, kyonki chouhan vansh kaa or prithviraj kaa swabhimaan se vipareet sandesh hoga
 Along with the changed political equation of Prithviraj's Sapadalakshsamrajya and the boundary of Sindhupradesh, the political importance of Vikampur was also increased
 kyonki vikampur kii seem ke saath hi sindhu or sapadalaksh pradeshon kii seemaa sammilat hoti thi
 In this way, the western part of Vikam Pradesh began to touch the boundary of Sindhupradesh and the former part of Sapalakshpradesh us samay vikampur main lodravavansh kaa shashan tha
 In the said political equation, the king of Jaisal, the Lodava dynasty, assisted Raja Ghori by sacrificing national interest
 kyonki ghori ke samarthan se hi lodravavansh ko shashan prapt hua tha
 How much Prithviraj fought with Ghori is disputed
 kyonki vibhinn aitihaasik sahitya main vibhinn yudhsaikhyaayein pradutt hai
 But the description of their fierce war is available everywhere
 narin kaa pratham yuddh or narin kaa dwitiya yudhm to prasiddh hi hai
 The first war took place in the year 1191 AD and the second war was in the year 1992 AD
 pratham yuddh main prithviraj kii vijay hui or dwitiya main prithviraj kii paraajay
 Prithviraj Raso is mentioned in the poem that, Prithviraj passed and punished Ghori thrice
 prithviraj ne ghori ko saat baar bandi kiya tha aisa hammirmahakavy main praapt hota he
 It is mentioned in the Prabandhak that Prithviraj had arrested and released Ghori twenty times
 surjancharitamahakavy ke anusaar ikkis baar prithviraj ne ghori ko dand diya tha
 According to the Prabandhchintamani text, twenty-three times Prithviraj left Ghori alive
 ghori ke saath prithviraj ke jitne yuddh hue, unke pramaan anuplabdh hai
 Therefore, the dispute regarding the definite number remains unchanged
 parantu itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, prithviraj or ghori ko madhya anek baar gharshan hue the
