 The Commonwealth Prajabhoomi or Commonwealth Territories, known in English as the Commonwealth Realm, are said to be the 16 universal nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, ruled by the same ruler, Queen Elizabeth II
 ye saare desh ek hi rajasatta, shaasha, rajpariwaar or uttaradhikaar kram ko saanjhaa karte hai
 The system began with the Statute of Westminster of 1931, by which the then Dominion of Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were granted equal or complete legal independence with equal members of the British Commonwealth
 She had gone
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad se, vishwa bhar main vistrut, british samrajya ke tamaam deshon ko ek dominian ke rup main swadhinata pradaan kar di gayi
 Some of which, despite being completely independent, maintained their loyalty to the monarchy, while some states refused to consider the British monarchy as the nominal head and declared themselves a republican state
 aaj, vishwa baahar main kul 16 aise rajya hai jo swayan ko maharani elizabeth dwitiya ke ek prajabhumi ke rup main pahchaan karavvate hai
 Under the British sovereign in the English language, these states are commonly known as Rialm, which is derived from the French word royum, a realme, a state, territory or territory over which a king / queen rules
 yahan yah jaananaa aavashyak he kii, united kingdom yaa rashtramandal yaa kisi bhi rashtramandal pradesh kii aadhikarik shabdaawalee main "realm" ek vaidhik yaa kanoonee shabd nahin he, arthath "realm" kii koi kanoonee paribhaasha nahin he
 Therefore, there is no obligation that these states under the British sovereign be addressed by any special name, nor does the term "realm" define any particular status of a state
 haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because, Canada and Australia are federal nations, so each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession
 2011 main rashtramandal kii baithak main british pradhanmantri david camerun ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi ki tamaam rashtramandal pradesh purush praathamikta kii parampara ko samaapt karne ke liye raji ho gaye hai, tathaa bhavishya ke shaskaon par catholic vyaktiyon se vivaah karne par roak ko bhi radd karne par sab kii sweekruti le lee gayi thi
 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 According to the Acts of Settlement of 1701, only the "legitimate" Protostant descendants of Sophia, the granddaughter of James I, the granddaughter of Hanover, were able to inherit the throne
 arthath, shahi parivaar ke vansh ke keval jaays santan hi singhasana par uttaradhikaar kaa haq rakhte hai, or koi bhi avaidh santan, tathaa unke vanshaj, singhasana par kisi bhi prakaar kaa adhikaar nahin rakhte hai
 In this context, according to the provisions of the Royal Marriage Act, 1772, any member of the royal family is required to obtain the sovereign's approval to marry, and any marriage done without the sovereign's approval shall be deemed "illegal", and The person and his children will be deprived of authority over the throne
 is adhinium ke praavdhaanon main 2013 ke saxeshan tu da crown act dwaara kuch parivartan laaye gaye
 According to the Act, the first six members of the succession order are required to obtain sovereign permission to marry, otherwise the person and all the progeny and descendants of that marriage will be deemed to be deprived of the succession order
 parantu aisi kisi bhi vivaah ko kisi bhi prakaar se gaiyr-kanoonee nahin qaraar ja saktaa he
 The group of the closest members of the sovereign's family is called the royal family
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhaan nahin he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Nonetheless, those individuals to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness are generally referred to are members of the royal family
 is maapdand ke aadhaar par raaj parivaar main, adhirat, unke / unki sahachaari, purv samprabhu kii vidhwaa / vidhurgan, wales ke rajkumaar ke jyeshthatam putr ke santan, tathaa purv shaasha ke putron kii dharmapatniyaan yaa unki vidhwaayen or unke purush-rekha ke pautra shaamil honge
 In the context of different Commonwealth territories, different terminology can also be used for this particular group, for example, in Australia this group is called the Australian Royal Family and in Canada the Canadian Royal Family
 18 veen or 19veen sadi ke dauraan britain ke aupniveshik vistaar dwaara, britain ne vishwa ke anya anek bhu-bhaagon ve kshetron par apana kabza jamaa liya
 Most of the countries achieved independence from Britain by the mid-20th century
 haalaanki un sabhi deshon ne united kingdom kii sarkaar kii adhipatyata ko nakaar diya, parantu unamem se kai raashtra, british shaasha ko apane adhirat ke rup main manyata dete hai
 These countries are called Commonwealth Territories or Commonwealth Praja Bhumi
 varttman kaal main, united kingdom ke adhirat keval united kingdom ke hi nahin balki uske atirikt kul 15 anya rashtron ke adhirat bhi hai
 Although in these nations also they have almost the same rank and authority as in Britain, but in those countries, they have no real political or traditional duties, almost all the duties of the ruler as their representative fulfills the General Manager of that country
 
 britain kii sarkaar kaa rashtramandal pradeshon kii sarkaron ke kaary main koi bhi bhoomika yaa hastkshep nahin he
 Commonwealth countries other than Britain: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, St
 Lucia, St
 Kitts and Nevis, St
 Vincent and the Grenadines and Tuvalu Are included
 purvatah rashtron ke rashtramandal ke saare desh rashtramandal paribhumi ke hissaa hua karte the, parantu 1950 main bharat ne swatantraaa ke pashchaat swayan ko ganraajya ghoshit kiya, or british rajasatta kii rashtrapramukh ke rup main samprabhutaa ko bhi khatm kar diya
 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he

 After this, when Chaudhary comes to know about this, he assigns the task of searching for some people
 iske pashchaat yah kahani pehle bablu ke dost se shuru hoti he, jo apane premika ko ghar se bhagaakar le jaataa he or uske pita choudhary apane putree ko khojane ke liye us ke doston ko pakad ke laate he
 One of their friends reveals the address of another friend and that is his third friend Joe Bablu
 iske pashchaat vah log bablu ko bhi le aate he
 But Bablu tells nothing
 isi dauraan vah log raat ko un logo se bhaagane kaa sochate he
 And when he keeps waiting for the train in the morning, Bablu sees Dimpy and falls in love with Dimpy at the same time
 uske jane ke kuch samay ke pashchaat un logon ko phir se pakad liya jaataa he or band kar diya jaataa he
 That girl Dimpy is his second daughter and he is prohibited from going to college
 isi ke kaaran vah un bandiyon se apni didi kaa pataa poochne ke liye pahunchati he
 But those people do not tell him this
 iske pashchaat vah un logon ko chhudwane kaa laalach bhi detii he
 Bablu tells him that he loves a girl and asks her to find him
 raat main vah usee jagah se baahar nikalakar uske ghar jaataa he or vahaan usase milane jaataa he
 There, he drinks alcohol from a bottle of wine and roams around
 tab vidyut pravaah jane ke kaaran andhera rahata he
 This is why no one recognizes him
 vah us ladki dimpi ke kamare main jaataa he jahaan kuch samay ke pashchaat dimpi pahunchati he
 Bablu then gives him another part of one earring and says that this earring belongs to the girl he loves
 jab vah ladki us bali ko dekhati he to vah bali usee kaa hi rahata he jo kuch dinon pehle gum gaya rahata he
 After this Dimpy comes to know whom Bablu loves
 lekin yah raaj vah use nahin bataati
 But the other day Dimpy comes in front of Bablu and Bablu comes to know that the girl who was lured to take him out and the one he loves are the same
 uske pashchaat choudhary un logon se pataa poochta he lekin bablu un logon ko galat sthaan par le jane kaa soch kar idhar udhar bhatkaate rahata he
 But they later meet and Chaudhary leaves them and says that she is dead for him
 or vah sabhi vahaan se chale jate he
 With that, he also leaves those friends
 choudhary ko pataa chalata he ki dimpi or bablu ek duusare se pyaar karte he or is kaaran vah usee samay dimpi kii shaadi kisi or se karne kaa tay kar letaa he lekin us din bablu bhi vahaan pahunch jaataa he
 For this reason, Chaudhary is scared and stays with him so that he does not take away his daughter too
 isi ke baad ant main choudhary ko lagata he ki bablu uske liye sabase acha he or vah swayan hi dimpi kaa bablu ke saath shaadi karvaa detaa he
 But Bablu asks him to get Renu and Rakesh married before that and Chaudhary gives his consent in that too
 or kahani samaapt ho jaati he

 rameces dwitiya ke baad ke firo use mahaan purakhaa kehete, vah tuthankhamun ke baad misr kaa sabase prasiddh firo mana jaataa he
 At the beginning of his reign, the Ramesses undertook many campaigns and wars so that the lost province of Egypt was again under Egypt
 rameces ne kuch vidroh roke nubia ke or libya ko apane adheen kiya
 The famous Kadesh war tells us about his warrior
 rameces ke shashan kaal ke dusre varsh hi samudri luutere jinhen misr vaasi samudr ke log yaa sherdan kehete the unhone misr main lutpaat shuru kar di
 There is not much information about who these robbers were, but according to scholars these robbers were from the Mediterranean Sea
 rameces ne in luutero ke viruddh abhiyaan shuru kiya jo baad main safal sabit hua
 This looter again entered the Egyptian army and supported Ramesses in many military campaigns
 apane shashan kaal ke chauthe varsh rameces ne syria par akraman kiya, vahaan usne kanan desh par akraman kiya or vijay pai
 He took the prince of Canaan captive to Egypt
 phir rameces ne amurru naam ke hittite samrajya ke praant ko apane adheen kar liya
 After the success of his first campaign, the Ramesses attacked the city of Kadesh on the fifth year of his reign, which was under the Hittite empire but earlier under Seti I
 hittite samrajya bhi taiyaar tha or usne bhi ek badi sena ke saath hamalaa kiya
 This war became famous as the war of Kadesh
 hittite samrajya kaa raja muvatalli dwitiya ne apane pados ke 19 rajya ke saath rameces ke viruddh ek sangh bana liya tha, vahi rameces ne bhi apane kai mitra rajyon kii sena ke saath kadesh Only Canaan in the north of Egypt was under the Ramesses and Syria was under the Hittite empire
 hittite samrajya ke saath milakar kanan ke rajkumaar ne vidroh shuru kar diya misr ke viruddh jis kaaran rameces ko dubaara syria janaa padaa| rameces ke shashan kaal ke 7ve varsh vah syria gaya or is baar usne hittite sena ko parrast kar diya
 During this campaign Ramesses divided his army into 2 divisions, one he was led by himself and led his troops to his son amun-her-khepeshif and defeated the Shasu Kabile, the Dead Sea and the Head Mountains
 Subjected
 phir amun-her-khepeshef ne moab rajya jeeta
 The Ramesses advanced to conquer Jerusalem and arrived in the kingdom of Moab, where they included their army, conquered Damascus and then the city of Uppi, and began their rule over Syria

 Firoz's empire was smaller than him, but Alauddin was not smaller than Khilji's empire
 firoj kii mrityu ke baad dilli sultanate kaa vighatan ho gaya or uttar bharat chote-chote rajyon main bant gaya
 Although Tughlaq ruled till 1413, the end of the Tughlaq Empire should be considered with the invasion of Delhi by Timur in 1399
 in teenon yogya shaskaon ke baad koi or shaasha sahi shashan na kar sake
 After this, the decline of the Tughlaq dynasty started
 inke alaava kuch shaasha or hue jinka naam is prakaar he:- This dynasty came to an end in 1414 following the invasion of Timur and the absence of a successor, which was followed by the rule of the Sayyid dynasty

 iske prayog se guna or bhaag jaisi jatil prakriyaaon ko jod or ghataane jaisi apekshaakrit saral kriyaaon main badal diya jaataa he
 Before the advent of computers and calculators, complex mathematical gunas were done using logarithms
 ganit main kisi die hue aadhaar par kisi sankhya kaa laghuganak vah sankhya hoti he jisko us aadhaar ke upar ghaat lagane se uskaa maan di hui sankhya ke baraabar ho jaay
 For example, the logarithm of 1 xxrep 5 0 on base 10 would be 5 because applying 5 to base 10 increases its value to 1 xxrep 5 0 
 arthath kisi sankhya x, aadhaar b or ghaataank n, ke liye This definition is valid only if the base b is any positive real number other than 1, ie b> 0 yb ≠ 1, x is any positive real number and n is any real number
 prayek laghuganak kaa aadhaar hona aavashyak he
 The same number has different logarithms for different bases
 saadhaarant: aadhaar ke liye do sankhyaon kaa vyavhaar hota he, jinke anusaar laghuganak kii do pranaliyaan banaai gai hai
 The logarithm base in the natural system is considered an irrational number e
 iske avishkaarak jon nepier ke naam par aise laghuganakon ko 'neperiya laghuganak' bhi kehete hai
 The value of e is expressed by an infinite series and is approximately equal to 2

 ucch ganit ke saidhantik kaaryon ke liye isi pranali kaa upyog hota he
 The inventor of the second system is Henry Brig
 is pranali main laghuganak kaa aadhaar 10 he
 This is called 'simple logarithm'
 yah vyaavhaarik prayogon ke liye upyukt he
 Replicator: If log a = b then b is called a copy of a
 jaise, log 39
2 = 1
5933, to antilog 1
5933 = 39
2 When both x and b are positive real numbers, the value of logb is a unique real number
 aadhaar b kaa nirpeksh maan 0 yaa 1 ko chhodkar kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 10, e or 2 are often taken as the basis for their respective fields of use
 vaastavik sankhyaon tathaa samishra sankhyaon ke laghuganak paribhaashit hai
 The following results come directly from the definition of logarithm- atah And antatah That's why jisaki ek vishesh sthiti nimnlikhit he- From the above, the following universal identity is obtained
 athwa: The integer part of the logarithm of a number is called the integer and the decimal part as the numerator
 udhaaharan ke liye log10 = 3
66048 hota he
 3
66048 has 3 integers and 0
66048 is a remainder
 kisi sankhya ke laghuganak kaa purnansh gyaat karne kaa niyam nimnlikhit he : Following are the rules for finding the imperfections: apurnansh sankhya ke maan or usamen vyavahrut ankon ke kram par nirbhar karata he
 If two numbers have the same type of digits arranged in the same order and only the decimal point has a different location, then the numbers in those numbers will be the same, because the decimal does not depend on the location of the decimal point in the number
 udhaaharan ke liye 4538 or 45

 John Napier, a resident of Scotland and Joost Burgi of Switzerland, independently invented logarithms
 in donon ke laghuganak ek duusare se bhinn the tathaa prakritik laghuganak or saamaanya laghuganak bhi bhinn the
 Napier's logarithm was published in 1614 in Edenver under the title Mirphysi logarithmorum kanonis descriptio
 1620 i
 main preg main just burgi kaa laghuganak arithemetice under geometrice progress tebulen sheershak ke antargat prakashit hua
 By this time Napier's logarithm had been propagated all over Europe

 WR Macdonald translated it into English in 1889 AD
 1614 i
 ke nepirian laghuganak tathaa prakritik laghuganak kaa parsparik sambandh nimna dhang se vyakt kiya jaataa he : Napier did not consider the unit's logarithm to be zero
 falswaroop inke siddhant ke anusaar, bina sanshodhan ke ladhuganak se sangat sameekaran bal = na sambhav nahin tha
 Burghi's publication of 1620 AD contains a table of replicators
 isamen laghuganak laal or sankhyaayein kaale rang main chhapi hai
 His Grundlikhe Unterricht was published in 1856 AD, in which the logarithm of the unit is assumed to be zero
 burgi kii sarini kii kuch panktiyaan udaahranarth neeche di gai he : Red --- 0 --- 10 --- 20 --- xxrep 8 
 kaali--- 1 xxrep 8 0 --- 10001 xxrep 4 0 --- 100020001--- xxrep 8 
 The first line is the parallel range
 duusari pankti gunottar shrenee he, jiskaa saamaanya anupaat 1
0001 he
 The eight digits at the end of the second line are considered decimal digits and expressed in black
 yadi 1
0001 kaa laghuganak 10 he, to spasht he ki iskaa aadhaar = 1
 xxrep 5 0 999 xxrep 7 
 he
 Burghi's knowledge of the basis of logarithms does not seem to be more than Napier's
 jon wolis ne 1685 i
 tathaa bernuli ne 1694 i

 In the Dhakwala commentary of Hekhandagam, the words semicircle, triad, quadrilateral etc
 have been used, which is very similar to the verb of logarithm
 udhaaharan ke liye 32 kaa ardhachchhed 5 he jo bataata he ki 32 ko baar-baar aadha karen to 5-baar main 1 aa jaataa he
 Similarly, the triad of 81 is 4 because if 81 is repeated thirds, then 1 comes in 4 times
 dhyaan dene yogya he ki ye kriyaayen kramshah log2, log3 aadi jaisi hi hai
 The development of simple logarithms is the result of the combined effort of John Napier and Henry Brig
 iskaa ullekh brig ke 'erithemetica logrithmika' main he
 If r is the radius of the circle, Brig suggested that the smaller r = 0 and the smaller = 1010
 nepier ke anusaar laghu 1 = 0, laghu r = 1010
 After some time, the behavior of short 10 = 1 started in place of short su = 1010

 Swami Ramanand is considered the great saint of the medieval devotional movement
 unhone rambhakti kii dhara ko samaaj ke nichle tabake tak pahunchaaya
 He was the first such Acharya who preached devotion in North India
 unke bare main prachlit kahawat he ki - dwavid bhakthi upjau-laayo ramanand
 That is, the credit of propagating devotion in North India goes to Swami Ramanand
 unhone tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt kuritiyon jaise chuaachhut, oonch-neech or jaat-paat kaa virodh kiya
 Swami Ramanand was born in a Brahmin family in Prayag
 unki mata kaa naam sushila devi or pita kaa naam punya sadan sharma tha
 In the early period, he started showing many supernatural miracles
 dharmik vichaaron vaale unke mata-pita ne balak ramanand ko shiksha paane ke liye kaashi ke swami radhvanand ke paas shrimath bhej diya
 While living in Srimath, he studied the Vedas, Puranas and other scriptures and became a scholar
 panchganga ghat sthit shrimath main rahete hue unhone kathor sadhana kii
 There are many misconceptions about his birthday, but most scholars believe that Swamiji was born in 1300 AD
 yani aaj se koi saat sau das saal pehle
 Swami Ramanand made the door of Rama Bhakti accessible to all
 unhone anantanand, bhavanand, peepa, sen, dhanna, nabha das, narharyanand, sukhanand, kabir, raidas, sursari, padamavati jaise baarah logon ko apana pramukh shishy banaaya, jinhe dwadash mahabhagwat ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Among them, Kabir Das and Raidas later gained considerable fame
 kabir auki ravidaas ne nirgun ram kii upasna kii
 In this way, Swami Ramanand was such a great saint under whose shade both saguna and nirgun saints and worshipers found rest
 jab samaaj main chaaro ore aapasi katoota or vaimnasy kaa bhav bharaa nua tha, vaise samay main swami ramanand ne naaraa diya-jaat-paat puche naa koi-firi ko bhajai so hari kaa hoi
 unhone survey prapattedhikarinon matah kaa shankhanaad kiya or bhakthi kaa margh sabake liye khol diya
 He also gave women equal place in the canopy of devotion
 unke dwaara sthapit ramanand sampradaay yaa ramavat sampradaay aaj vaishnavon kaa sabase bada dharmik jamaat he
 Of the 52 gates of the Vaishnavas, 36 gates belong to the Ramanandis only
 is sampradaay ke sant bairangi bhi kahe jate hai
 They also have their own arenas
 yun to ramanand sampradaay kii shakhaaen auki upashakhaayen desh bhar main faili hai
 But there are hundreds of monasteries of this sect in Ayodhya, Chitrakoot, Nashik, Haridwar
 kaashi ke panchganga ghat par avasthit shrimath, duniya bhar main faile ramanandiyon kaa mul gurusthaan he
 In other words, the Shrimath of Kashi is the original Acharya Peetha of the Saguna and Nirgun Rambhakti tradition and the Ramanand community
 vartmaan main jagadguru ramanandacharya swami shriramnareshacharyaji maharaj, shrimath ke gaadi par virajman hai
 He is a learned scholar of jurisprudence and is acclaimed in the Sant Samaj

 He went to many religious places in Puri and South India and preached Rambhakti
 pehle unhen swami ramnuj kaa anuyaadi mana jaataa tha lekin srisampradaay kaa acharya hone ke baavjood unhone apni upasna paddati main kaam or sita ko variyata di
 He made them his worshipers
 ram bhakthi kii paavan dhara ko himalay kii paavan oonchaiyon se utarkar swami ramanand ne garibon or vanchiton kii jhopadi tak pahunchaaya
 ve bhakthi maarg ke aise sopan the jinhone vaishnav bhakthi sadhana ko nayaa aayam diya
 Their sacred feet are still safe in Shrimath, Kashi, which is the center of faith of crores of Ramanandis

 unhone shri sitaaji dwaara prithvi par pravartit vishishtadvait siddhant tathaa rambhakti kii dhara ko madhyakaal main anupam tivrata pradaan kii
 He is acknowledged as the proponent of the modern Bhakti path in Uttarabharata and the original promoter of Vaishnava cultivation
 ek prasiddh lokokti ke anusaar- In the erstwhile society, by removing the extreme animosity and bitterness among the various sect-sects, Hindu society did an important work of formulation
 swamiji ne maryaada purushottam shriram ko adarsh maanakar saral rambhakti maarg kaa nidarshan kiya
 In his disciple circle, while on the one hand there were casteist, untouchable, Vedic rituals like Kabirdas, Raidas, Sennai and Pipanresh, anti-virtue saints of idolatry, on the other side, archanavatar, a full-fledged supporter of avatarism, considered idolatrous masters Swami Anantananda, Bhavananda, Sursurananda, Sagunopasak Acharya like Narahariyananda was also a devotee
 usee parampara main krishnadutt payohari jaisaa tejasvi sadhak or goswami tulsidas jaisaa vishwa vishrut mahakavi bhi utpann hua
 It is famous about Acharya Ramanand that he preached Tarak Ramantra by climbing trees so that people of all castes can fall in ears and get maximum welfare of people
 unhone naaraa diya tha- Acharyapada independently enforced the Sreesapradaya
 is sampradaay ko ramanandi athwa vairaagi sampradaay bhi kehete hai
 He described the distinction of caste-line in the path of devotion with the feeling of strengthening the society, shattering and falling down, and said that the path of refuge of God is equally open to all- kahkar unhone kisi bhi jati-varan ke vyakti ko ramamantra dene main sankoch nahin kiya
 Raidas, born in tanner caste and raised in Kabul's home, Kabirdas are unique examples of this
 madhyayugin dharm sadhana ke centre main swami ji kii sthiti chatushpath ke deep-stambh jaisi he
 He protected society and culture with great vigor by initiating unprecedented social revolution
 unheen ke chalate uttarbharat main tirth kshetron kii raksha or vahaan saanskrithik kendron kii sthapana sambhav ho saki
 According to the circumstances of that era, Vairagini organized an active idolized form of Dharma to protect the pilgrimage by organizing the Sadhu Samaj as a prostitute equipped with weapons
 tirthasthanon se lekar gaanv-gaanv main vairaagi saadhuon ne akhaade sthapit kiye
 Even in this asymmetrical state of depreciation, all the monasteries, saints, Ramgunagans, Akhand Ramnath Sankirtans of the Ramanand Sampradaya are still organized throughout the world and are spreading spiritual light everywhere
 vaishnavon ke baawan dwaaron main sarvaadhik santis dwaare isi sampradaay se jude hai
 Apart from this, its branch, prashaka and avantara branches such as Ramsnehi, Kabirdasi, Ghisapanthi, Dadupanth etc
 have become the conduits of the origin of this sect
 yah swami ramanand ke hi vyaktitv kaa prabhaav tha ki hindu-muslim vaimnasy, shaiva-vaishnav vivaad, varna-vidwesh, mat-matantar kaa jhagada or paraspar saamaajik katutaa bahut had tak kam ho gai
 Impressed by the miracle of his own compound power, the then Mughal ruler Mohammad Tughlaq came to the shelter of Swami Ramanandacharya through Sant Kabirdas and issued a directive to remove all restrictions on the Hindus and Jaziyakar
 balpurvak islam dharm main dikshit hinduon ko phir se hindu dharm main waapas laane ke liye paravartan sanskaar kaa mahaan kaary sarvapratham swami ramanandaarch ne hi prarambh kiya
 History testifies that thirty-four thousand Rajputs under the leadership of King Harisingh of Ayodhya had inspired Swamiji to adopt Swadharma from a single platform

 guru raghavanand or mata-pita ke dabaav ke baavjood unhone grihasthashram sweekaar nahin kiya or aaajeevan virakt rahane kaa sankalp liya
 In this way, Swami Ramanand was given the initiation of Ramatarak Mantra

 dderghaayushya praapt karne ke kaaran jagadguru raghavanand ne apane tejasvi or priy shisht ramanand ko shrimath peeth kii paavan peeth par abhishikt kar diya
 In his first address, Jagadguru Ramanandacharya expressed his resolve to overcome the evil practices and superstitions prevalent in Hindu society and to build a vast organized power for the protection of religion through mutual affection and affectionate behavior
 kaashi ke param paavan panchganga ghat par avasthit shrimath, acharyapad ke dwaara pravaahit shriram prapatti kii pavandhaara ke mukhyakendre ke rup main pratishthit hokar usee ojasvi parampara kaa anwarat pravartan kar rahaa he
 Even today, according to the vision of Srimath Acharyacharan, he is lighting the public with a lamp lit by him
 yahi vah divyasthal he, jahaan virajman hokar swamiji ne apane parampratapi shishyon ke madhyam se apni anugrahshakti kaa upyog kiya tha

 shrimath main avasthit ramanandaarch kii charanpaduka duniyabar main bikhare ramanandi santon, tapasviyon evam anuyaayiyon kii shraddha kaa anyatam bindu he
 It is a matter of absolute good fortune and satisfaction that Swami Ramnareshacharyaji, the present presiding teacher of Srimath also seems to be an icon of Swami Ramanandacharach
 unki kalpanaaen, unka gyaan, unki vagmita or sabase acchhee unki udaartaa or sangyojan chetana aisi he ki yah vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki swami ramanand kaa vyaktitv kaisaa rahaa hoga
 The present Jagadguru Ramanandacharacha post is the result of the well-known efforts of the eminent Swami Ramnareshacharya Ji Maharaj that Kabiradasi, Ravidasi, Ramasnehi, Prabhriti traditions, which have been separated from Srimath, are in harmony with Vaishnava and establish uniformity with Srimath
 kai paramparawaadi math mandiron kii ikaiyaan shrimath main villin ho rahi hai

 tatv evam acharbodh kii drushti se vaishnavamtabj bhaskar, shrirampatal, shriramarchanapaddati, shriramarakshastrotam jaisi anek kaaljayi moulik granthon kii rachana kii

 The saints of Babaripanth worshiped him as the originator of their sect and he was the Guru of Kabir, hence his reverence among the Kabirists is natural

 Certainly, according to his great personality and great importance, the description of his Ramaavatar mentioned in certain scriptures and saint literature is literally proved

 According to this verse Bhaskaracharya belonged to the Shandilya gotra and was a resident of a place called Vizjalvid in the Sahyadri region

 There is no clear information about Bhaskaracharya's death

 17veen sadi kii shuruyaat main yah shahar khiva khaanat kii rajdhani bana
 The Khiwa Khan was ruled by a branch of descendants who ruled over the Astrakhan Khan of Genghis Khan

 jab 1917 main rus main samyavaadee kranti hui to yahan kuch samay kii liye ek 'khorasm jan soviet ganatantr' ghoshit kar diya gaya or khiva khaanat hameshaa ke liye khatm ho gai
 In 1925, this republic was annexed into the Soviet Union and the city of Khiva became part of Uzbekistan
 madhyakaal main khiva apane daason ke bazaar ke liye prasiddh tha jahaan manushyon ko kharida-bechaa jaataa tha
 Iranian and Russian people were often sold here

 When Russia started efforts to seize Khiwah, it also stated the end of this slavery as one of its main objectives

 pahalwaan mahmud kaa mazebara, jo 14veen sadi main ek sipaahi-kavi the Russian attack on Khiwa aitihaasik imaaraten Mother and son on the road of Khiwa kanji, japan dwaara apanaae gaye shabd-chihnik chini aksharon jinhen aadhunik japani lekhan paddati main hiraagaana or katakana ke saath upyog kiya jaataa he
 The Chinese letters of the Japanese word Kanji literally mean "han letter" and are written with the same letters as the Chinese word Hanzi
 chini akshar japan main sabase pehle aadhikarik muharon, patron, talavaaron, sikkon, aainon or china se aayaat kii gai sajaavati chizon ke zarie pahaunchi
 The oldest known example of this is Na King's gold seal which was given by Han Emperor Guangwu to a Yamato envoy
 pratham shatabdi isvi ke chini sikkon ko yyoi kaal ke puratetvik sthalon se paaya gaya he
 But the Japanese of that period had no knowledge of Chinese script and were to remain the same until the fifth century
 nihon shoki or kojiki ke anusaar vaani naamak ek pandit ko bekaje ke rajya se paanchavi sadi main samraat ogin ke shasankaal main japan bheja gaya tha, jo apane saath kunfyushiyasi dharm or chini akshar laayaa
 The first Japanese documents were probably written by bilingual Chinese or Korean officials in the Yamato court
 chini aksharon se parichay ke samay japani bhashaa kaa koi likhit rup nahin tha, or paathon ko keval chini main hi padhaa or likhaa jaataa tha
 During the Heian period, a method called Kanbun began, in which Chinese text was written with diacritical marks, which changed the order of words and verb conjugation according to Japanese grammar
 chini aksharon ko japani shabdon ko likhane ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jane laga, jisase aadhunik kaana shabdanshmalaon ko janm hua
 In the year 650, Manayogana was developed in which Chinese letters were used for their sound rather than meaning
 maanayogana ko ghaseet style main likhane se hiraagaana, yaa onnade kaa vikaas hua - ek lekhan paddati jo mahilaon ke liye sulabh thi 
 mahilaon dwaara rachi gai heian kaal ke sahitya ke pramukh kritiyaan hiraagaana main hai
 Katakana developed in a similar way: Math students simplified the Manayogana letters into only one constituent element
 is tarah, hiraagaana or katakana, jinhen ek saath kaana kehete hai, kanji ke upaj hai
 In modern Japanese, kanji is used for subject words such as noun, adjective root and verb root, while hiragana is used at the end of verb inflection and adjective and for phonetic complements, participles, and miscellaneous words for clear reading
 For those who have no Kanji or whose Kanji are old or difficult
 katakana kaa upyog arthanuranan, gair-japani shabdon, paudhon or jaanwaron ke naam, or kisi shabd par jor dene ke liye
 After World War II in 1946, under Allied Japan's suzerainty, reforms were made in writing under the instructions of the highest commander of the Allied Powers
 iskaa lakshya tha bacchon ke seekhney ko aasaan bananaa or sahitya or patrikaon ke liye kanji upyog ko saral karnaa
 The number of letters in use was reduced and a formal list of letters was prepared for learning in every classroom
 kuch aksharon ko sarlikrut rup die gaye, jinhen shinjitai kehete hai
 Variations of letters and alternatives to common letters were officially discouraged
 ye keval disha nirdesh hai, isliye is maanak ke baahar bhi kai aksharon kaa vistrut upyog hota he; inhen hyogiji kehete hai
 Kyoiku Kanji says the 1,006 letters that Japanese children learn in elementary school
 is suchi main pehle 881 akshar the, jise 1977 main badhaakar 996 akshar kiya gaya, or 1982 main 1,006 aksharon tak badhaayaa gaya
 Joyo Kanji has 2,136 characters, including all Kyoiku Kanji and 1,130 additional Kanji that are taught in high schools
 prakaashan main in suchi ke baahar ke kaanajiyon ko aksar furiganaa diya jaataa he
 Joey Kanji was launched in 1981, in exchange for a list called Toyo Kanji
 pehle is suchi main 1,945 akshar the, 2010 main ise badhaakar 2,136 kar diya gaya
 Since 27 September 2004 Jinmeyo Kanji has 3,119 characters, with Joey Kanji and 983 Kanji
 hyogai kanji aise kisi bhi kanji ko kehete hai jo joyo kanji yaa jinameio kanji kii suchi main nahin hai
 They are usually written with traditional letters, but in addition to these are the Shinjitai forms
 sabase pehle japani dastavezon ko shaayad yamato darbar ke seva main dwibhashi chini yaa korian adhikariyon ne likhaa tha
 There is no definite count of Kanji letters, as is not the case of Chinese letters
 dai kanava jiten main lagbhag 50,000 akshar hai, jise japan main vyapak mana jaataa he
 Zhonghua Xihai, published in China in 1994, has about 85,000 characters
 lekin inamen se adhiktar akshar kisi bhi desh main upyog main nahin hai, or kai vaikalpik yaa pracheen rup hai
 The way Kanji has been adopted in Japanese can lead to many words or forms being written from one Kanji and hence a letter may have different pronunciation
 pathak ke drushtikon se kanji ke ek yaa adhik "pathan" hote hai
 Even though multiple readings occur in the brain, choosing the correct reading is dependent on identifying the word, which can be referred to by context, meaning, and whether the Kanji compound is part of the word, and sometimes the location in the sentence
 udhaaharan ke liye, 今日ko "kyo" padhaa jaataa he, par aupchaarik lekhan main "connichi" padhaa jaataa he, arthath "aajkal"; ise sandarbh se samajha jaataa he
 Nevertheless, some cases are unclear and require furigana
 kanji pathnon ko onyomi yaa kunyomi or sabhi aksharon ke kam se kam do pathan hote hai, prayek se ek
 Some have only recitations, such as Kiku or Evashi; Kun-readings are common only to Kanji made in Japan
 kuch saamaanya kanjion ke das se adhik pathan hai; sabase jatil udhaaharan he 生, jise sei, sho, namaa, ki, o-u, i-kiru, i-kasu, i-keru, u-mu, u-mareru, ha-eru, or ha-yasu, kul 8 moolbhoot pathan 
 Often a letter is used for both sound and meaning, and only one has to choose the correct reading based on the word
 anya maamalon main, ek akshar ko keval apane dhwani ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, jise ateji kehete hai
 Onyomi recitation ") is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the Chinese pronunciation of a syllable
 ise pehle anuwaad pathan bhi kaha jaataa tha
 Old Japanese writings state that Onyomi recitations were made when a letter reached Japan and were sometimes adopted by the Chinese
 aise bhi kanji hai jinhen japan main banaaya gaya or china main na banane ke baavjood unhen onyomi di gai
 Some Kanji were taken from different parts of China at different times, so they have many onyomi and often multiple meanings
 japan main bane kanji ke aam taur par onyomi nahin hote, par apwaad hai, jaise 働"kaam karnaa", jiskaa kunyomi he "hataraku" or onyomi he "do" or 腺"granthi", jiskaa keval onyomi "sen" he
 In both cases their onyomies come from their phonetic component - 動 "two" and 泉 "sen"
