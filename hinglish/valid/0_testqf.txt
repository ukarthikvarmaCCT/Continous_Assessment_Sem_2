 Due to the influence of the means of communication, the impact of this fast spread throughout India and in support of it people started taking to the streets
 inhone bharat sarkaar se ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi lokapal vidheyak banane kii maang kii thi or apni maang ke anuroop sarkaar ko lokapal bill kaa ek masauda bhi diya tha
 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 sarkaar ne isaki raah main kai rode atkaaye evam 16 agast ko anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this led to agitation in the entire country
 desh bhar main agle 12 dilon tak lagaataar badi sankhya main dharna, pradarshan or anshan yojit kiye gaye
 Finally, on August 28, Anna announced the postponement of his fast after the Parliament passed the proposal of concurrence on three terms of Anna
 5 april 2011 ko ek shashakt lokapal vidheyak ke nirmaan kii maang par sarkari niskriyata ke pratirodh main anna hajaare ne aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev and many other famous social workers were involved in this campaign against corruption
 sarkaar ne ise upekshit karnaa jari rakhaa
 This fast began to be published and circulated widely in the media of India and soon
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jari is koshish ko sheeghra hi vyapak jansamarthan milane laga
 In almost all the cities of India, the youth took to the streets and demonstrated in support of it and distributed pamphlets
 anna hajaare ke anshan ke deshvyapee jan aandolan ke rup main fail jane se chintit sarkaar ne janalokapal vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye jhatpat ek samiti kii ghoshnaa kii
 It also agreed to pass a strong Lokpal Bill in Parliament before 16 August
 is tarah yah anshan samaapt hua or bhrashtachar ke viruddh panapata jan andolan majboot lokapal ke nirmaan kii aashaa ke saath samaapt hua
 But the government's intent was doubtful, so Anna Hazare also announced that if the expected Lokpal Bill is not produced by the next 15 August, then he will go on a fast from 16 August
 april main kiye gaye anna hajaare ke anshan kii samaapti kii sharton ke anuroop sarkaar ne 10 sadasyeey lokapal masauda nirmaan samiti ke nirmaan kii ghoshnaa kii

 anna hajaare ne sarkaar ke sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii baadhyataa vaale tark kaa virodh na karte hue kisi mantri ko samiti kaa adhyaksh hona sweekaar kar liya
 But the ministers of this committee headed by Kapil Sibal did their own arbitrariness
 pradhanmantri or nyaayadhishon ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke mudde par naagarik samaaj ke pratinidhiyon or sarkaar ke bich virodh bana rahaa
 Kapil Sibal said that civil society opinion will not be taken to make law in future
 antat mantriyon ne anna hajaare dwaara prastut jan lokapal ke sabhi mahatvapurn sujhaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 All the points of the Jan Lokpal were accepted for showing, which kept the government ministers and mps, and the judges out of the reach of the Lokpal
 antat sarkari mantriyon ke ravaiye se niraash anna hajaare ke saathiyon ne jan lokapal kaa masauda alag se nirmit kiya
 And thus the committee produced two drafts which were placed before the Union Cabinet
 vahaan bhi mantriyon ke masaude ko to purnatah prastut kiya gaya kintu jan lokapal kaa saransh rakhaa gaya
 And as expected, the cabinet adopted the draft ministers and agreed to present it in Parliament
 4 agast 2011 ko sansad main lokapal vidheyak prastut kiya gaya
 The Prime Minister was kept out of its purview during his tenure in the government's Lokpal Bill
 lekin sabhi bhootpurv pradhanmantri iske daayre main rakhe gaye the
 Accordingly, the Lokpal will be a committee headed by a current or retired judge
 isamen aath sadsy honge jisamen se chaar kaanoon ko jaanane vaale evam anbhavi log honge
 The time limit for investigation was kept at seven years
 bharat kaa 65 vaan swadhinata diwas samaaroh anna hajaare dwaara april ke anshan kii samaapti kii is ghoshnaa kii chaaya main hua ki yadi 15 agast tak sarkaar ne lokapal vidheyak paas nahin karaayaa to ve punah anshan karengen
 Several days before August 15, it had become clear that there would be a hunger strike announced from August 16
 sarkaar ne ise rokane kii har tarah kii koshish aarambh kar di
 Delhi Police refused permission to fast on Jantar Mantar till 1 August
 iske pashchaat anna hajaare ne chaar anya sthaan sujhakar vahaan anshan karne kii anumati maangi kintu vah bhi nahin di gai
 Finally, on August 13, Anna Hazare announced that if he was not allowed to go on a hunger strike, he would start the Jail Bharo movement

 Delhi Police granted permission to fast in JP Park with 22 restrictions
 anna hajaare ne inamen se 6 sharton ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 These included conditions to limit the number of protesters to 5000, to fast for 3 days, not to use loudspeakers at the venue of the fast, not to install tents, etc

 hamen pataa chalaa he ki vahaan dhara 144 lagi he par agar hamen vahaan jane se manaa kiya to ham usee jagah baith jaayenge ki le chalo jahaan chalanaa he
 Wherever the administration takes him, his fast will be there, "we will sit on a hunger strike in jail, taken there and if left again, we will come back to JP Park
 " August 16 was the day to test the power of Indian power and the people
 police ne anshan se nibatane kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi thi

 police ne unhen tathaa anya kaaryakartaaon ko tihaad jail bhej diya
 After the arrest of Anna Hazare, hundreds of people took to the streets from Jammu to Karnataka and from Kolkata to Jaipur to protest and the Jail Bharo movement started

 After spending three days in Tihar Jail, when Anna Hazare came out at quarter past 12, he was seen full of enthusiasm
 unhone inkulab jindabad or bharat mata kii jai ke naare ke saath apane samarthakon kaa josh badhaayaa
 Anna said while addressing the supporters "1947 main adhuri aazaadee mili
 The movement for independence gained in 1947 started in 1942 and now from August 16 another freedom struggle has started, which you have to reach the end
 anna rahe yaa na rahe lekin bhrashtachar ke khilaaf yah mashaal jalati rahani chahie
 i thank all of you who have been sitting outside the jail for 4 days and appeal to the children, old and young, to reach Ramlila Maidan in maximum numbers
 koi todfodaur rashtriya sampatti ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaen or trephic kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen
 He will talk to them only on the Ramlila ground
 " After conveying the message to the supporters, Anna Hazare left for Mayapuri in a procession
 khule trek main anna ke juluus ke saath- saath hajaaron logon kii bheed haath main tirangaa liye unke saath paidal march kar rahi thi
 Such a scene has rarely been seen on the streets of Delhi, when the public moved forward with slogans holding slogans in the heavy rain
 mayapuri chowk par pahunchane ke baad anna car se rajghat pahunche
 After spending 3 days in Tihar Jail, when Ramlila Maidan was prepared for the fast, Anna Hazare reached there at 2 o'clock in the afternoon on August 18 via Mayapuri and Rajghat with the procession
 vahaan unke aane kaa subah se intjaar kar rahe samarthakon ne naaron ke saath unka swaagat kiya
 On coming to the stage at Ramlila Maidan, Anna also greeted his supporters with the slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai, Inquilab Zindabad and gave him his message- “in 1942 there was a revolution in our country, which led to the British leaving
 angrej chale gaye, lekin bhrashtachar khatm nahin hua
 Therefore, the second fight for independence has started
 desh ke sabhi logon ne mere bhai, meri bahan, yuva - yuvatiyon ne yah jo mashaal jalaai he, is mashaal ko kabhi bujhane nahin dena
 The torch will continue to burn even if Anna Hazare remains
 abhi ek lokapal nahin is desh main puraa parivartan laana he
 We have to think how we will be able to give the palace to the poor affairs of the country
 kranti kii shuruyaat hochuki he
 i will not say much today because in the last three days my weight has reduced by 3 kg, but you are getting the energy of the movement you are running in the country
 ' Many countries have been made by youths, i am sure the youth of this country has awakened and now the future of this country is bright
 in gaddaaron ne desh ko lutaa he ab hambhrashtachar bardaasht nahin karenge
 We can never forget our freedom
 sar kataa sakate hai lekin sar jhukaa sakate nahin
 i am happy that there was no sabotage and no damage to national property
 ab main zyada kuch nahin kahuunga, lekin main aapse phir baat karuunga
 " 21 agast ko is andolan ko nai disha mili
 Addressing supporters at Ramlila Maidan, Anna Hazare said "vaise to is ramlila maidan main varsho se ravan jalataa aa rahaa he, magar is baar bhrashtachar kaa ravan jalegaa
 Their fight will stop only after the solution to end corruption
 mujhe kisi kaa dar nahin he
 Because i have neither any bank balance nor any assets
 mandir ke chah guna aath meter ke kamare main rahata hum
 "he called upon the people to go to the homes of the mps of their constituency and sit for their well being
 log baapu kaa priyabhajan raghupati raghav raja ram gaayen or saansadon se puuchhen ki lokapal par unki raay kya he
 He is with the government ombudsman or with the Jan Lokpal
 kyonki aap logon ne unhen vot diya he
 it's your right
 arvind kejariwal ne jaananaa chaha ki pradhanmantri bataaen ki sarkaar se kis jagah or kahaan baat kerani he
 He added further to Anna's talk that besides the mps, people should also go outside the houses of ministers and mlas in Delhi and picket and ask those people what their opinion is
 22 agast ko subah se shaam tak logon kaa saansadon or mantriyon ke gharon ke saamne jaakar pradarshan karne kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 Police also detained 50 people after demonstrating in front of Union Minister Kapil Sibal's house
 is andolan ko aage badhaane or kharchon ke liye paisa jutaney ke liye ramlila maidan main banaae gaye daan shivi par bhi logon kii lambii qatari lagi rahi
 Be it children or elderly, rich or poor, everyone was donating to this movement according to his ability
 log apane gharon se khaanaa banaakar yahaan anna ke samarthakon ko baant rahe the
 The rich businessman, who was distributing food and drink in a truck or a laborer who was busy in cleaning the Ramlila Maidan, all were coming here on a call of Anna to the country of their own free will
 anshan ke saatven din anna kaa vajan 5 kilo kam ho gaya
 Ketones started coming in his blood and urine
 lekin unka utsaah purvavat hi bana rahaa
 Concerned over the deterioration of his health and its political impact, the government appointed Pranab Mukherjee to hold talks
 pehle daur kii vaarta kaaphi sakaaratmak rahi
 Anna supporters differed on three issues and three terms were to be considered
 sarkari vaartakaron ne iske liye agle din subah tak kaa samay liya
 Dr
 Naresh Trehan had advised Anna Hazare to drip after checking the health of Anna Hazare on the evening of Tuesday 23 August but he also refused
 raat ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki dopaher ke baad doctoron ne kaha tha ki kidney main kuch samasya aa gai he or unhen drip ke zarie dawa deni hogi
 i told the doctors that i would listen to my conscience and tell what i would do
 meri antaratma kah rahi he ki tu ye kya kah rahaa he ki dil diya he, jaan bhi denge or jaan dene se darataa he
 

 So i have told the doctors that my conscience is saying that no medicine is to be taken
 mai mar gaya to parvaah nahin, mere baad kitne anna khadey ho gaye hai
 If something happens to their kidneys, then one of the thousands of people will give them the kidney
 doctor kii report ke baad sarkaar bhi kuch sochane lagegi or agar sarkaar kii ore se unhen jabardastee uthaakar le jane ke prayaas honto saare darwaazon par log khadey ho jaaen or mujhe le jane na dena
 "the government's position changed overnight and on 24 August it withdrew from the consensus reached yesterday
 usne jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main prastut karne se inkaar kar diya or anna ke anshan ko unki samasya bataaya
 The possibility of forcibly lifting Anna from the hunger strike also increased
 24 agast buudhvaar kii shaam ko samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna hazaare ne kaha- "do not commit violence 


 i will not tolerate violence
 agar main jail jaaun to aap log saansadon ke ghar par virodh jataao
 Do not do any harm to national property
 agar police aati he to main kushi se jail jaaoongaa
 or kal se sabko jail baro andolan karnaa he
 The country has to be saved from the path of non-violence
 ye azaadiki duusari ladaai he
 The government's attitude is not dictatorial, but dictatorship
 ye lokshahi ke liye bahut bada khatara he lekin meri vinati he ki agar sarkaar mujhe yahaan seuthae to use koi roke nahin
 Now i have understood the tricks of the government
 sarkaar chaahati he ki andolan ko todane ke liye aap log hinsa karen
 So we all have to be restrained
 "25 agast ko anshan ke 10wein din ramlila maidan main anna hajaare ne kaha ki "meraa vajan sirf 6
5 kilogram kam hua he
 The rest is fine
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main jan lokapal vidheyak paarit hone tak nahin maruunga
 i am getting a lot of energy from you
 " Demonstrations across the country continued for the tenth consecutive day in support of Anna Hazare
 lagaataar duusare din logon ne pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 50 of them were taken into custody
 ahimsaatmak pradarshnon se ghabaraai sarkaar kii suraksha ke naam par par dilli police ne pradhanmantri awaas ke najadik ke chaar metro steshnon- huda city centre or jahangirpuri ke bich sthit udyog bhawan, res course or jor baag tathaa kendriya sachivalay se badarpur maarg par khan market metro stesan ko dopaher teen baje se band karvaa diya
 In an interaction with Anna Hazare's representatives and the government, the Prime Minister said while trying to calm the deadlock that arose on August 24, the government is ready to discuss the bill and government bill of Aruna Rai including Jan Lokpal in the House
 bhrashtachar ke masale par loksabhaa main charchaa kii gai
 The Lok Sabha, including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, unanimously appealed to Anna Hazare to end his fast
 iske baad kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogikimantri vilasarav deshmukh ne ramlila maidan jaakar anna hajaare ko sabhi partiyon tathaa sansad kii ore se bheja gaya patr diya or unase anshan samaapt karne kaa aagrah kiya
 On the proposal of getting the Jan Lokpal including Aruna Rai's Bill and the Government Bill discussed in the House, Anna said that "if the discussion on the Jan Lokpal Bill starts in Parliament, we will consider breaking our fast
" lekin hamaari teen mukhya maange hai
 Appointment of Lokayukta in states, bringing lower level officers also under the purview of Lokpal and make a citizen charter
 yah teenon garibon ke liye hai
 Their fast will continue until there is a consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues
 pradhanmantri or puri sansad dwaara apane swasthya par chintaa jataae jane par apni pratikriya dete hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki "iske liye ham unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 But he was worried about my health today
 anna ke swasthya kii chintaa he unhen to vah 10 dinon se kahaan the
 Actually, the concern is those who have come here
 air condishan main baithne waalon ko anna ke swasthya kii chintaa nahin he
 "anna wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter to Vilasrao that-" We have great respect for our Parliament, our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 " main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha, jis tarah se aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai usee tarah se main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa rahata hoon
 i have no power of any kind
 main ek bahut saamaanya aadmi hoon or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hoon
 Our movement is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai
 We want to change the corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere kisi saathi ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye kiye gaye hon jisase aapako yaa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahaunchi ho to main ham sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hoon
 It is not our goal to hurt anyone
 har rajya main isi kaanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen, har vibhaag main jan samasyaon ke liye citizans charter banaae jaae jise na maanane par sambandhit adhikari par karrwai ho or teesraa ye ki centre sarkaar ke upar se neeche tak sabhi karmchaariyon or rajya ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Can a motion be brought to Parliament on these three things? i have no hope that all our mps will be ready at the beginning to rid the people of the country of corruption every day
 My conscience says that if these things are agreed in Parliament, then i should break my fast
 " The rest of the Jan Lokpal bill, such as the selection process, is also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga jab tak baaqi saare muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa kyonki yahi janata kii awaz he
 So many people have joined me all over the country in the hope that they will get rid of corruption
 iske liye jaruri he ki rajyon main bhi lokayukta ke gathan ke liye kanoon paas ho
 There should be a system to fight against the corruption of the officials, who have to face two-four daily corruption
 isi tarah sabhi sarkari sevaaon ke liye samaysima tay ho or unhen samay par puraa nahin karne vaale adhikari par jurmaana lage
 This letter of Anna was also discussed at the Anna Hazare Prime Minister's residence, but the attitude of the government remained the same the next day
 
 With this, the government had prepared a section of media through advertisements and other means which was now trying to justify their stand
 kai sanchaar madhyam anna team ke bich foot, pradarshkon ke bich lokapal kii kam samajhadaari aadi vishay uthaane lage the
 Despite this the movement was continuing and the government was under increasing pressure
 sansad kii kaarywai kaa sidhaa prasaaran dekhakar evam netaaon ke bayaan or chehre dekhakar janata anna ke saath rahane ke nirnay par atal thi
 On August 26, after remaining silent for 11 days, Rahul Gandhi, who is considered the future helper of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said - "it is a dangerous practice to reduce the dignity of democracy
" vyaktigat rup se kai logon ne desh ko mahatvapurn yogadan diya he lekin ye samajhnaa zaruri he ki loktantric prakriya kaa apana mahatv he, loktantricprakriya lambii zarur hoti he par isse sabhi ko apana vichaar rakhane kaa mauka miltaa he
 

 In the past, it is being understood that the coming out of an ombudsman law will get rid of corruption, but it is wrong, just by enacting an ombudsman law will not end corruption, but it will have to find solutions to many more challenges
 Kiran Bedi wrote on Twitter that, "it may not be enough for an ombudsman to get started
" "rahul gandhi ke bayaan se acroshit anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne shuukravaar ko unke tughlaq road sthit awaas ke baahar pradarshnakia or jamkar narebaaji kii
 Police took 50 of Anna's supporters into custody
 rahul gandhi ne apane ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe anna samarthakon ke liye cold drinks or samose bhijwaaye
 On 27 August, the government debated Anna's three main demands in Parliament
 
 By 8 o'clock in the night, both the houses of Parliament passed a resolution to send it to the Standing Committee to consider these conditions by voice
 sansad ke donon sadanon main shanivaar ko lokapal mudde par anna hajaare kii maangon ke anuroop laae gaye prastaav par saidhantik rup se sahmati banane ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa patr lekar kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri vilasarav deshmukh, saansad sandip dikshit or purv kendriya mantri vilaas mutemvaar ne anna ko ramlila maidan pahunchakar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare addressed the supporters and said, "jan Lokpal has won this half
 puri jeet abhi baaki he
 This is the victory of the entire youth power
 yah janataki jeet he
 This is the victory of social organization
 yah media kii jeet he
 "I want to end my fast in the presence of you all at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that too with your permission
 aap jashn jarur manaaen lekin dhyaan rakhen ki isse shanti bhang na ho or kisi ko pareshaani na ho
 Anna ended the fast on 28 August by drinking honey-mixed coconut water at the hands of Simran, a five-year-old girl from the Dalit community of Sundernagri, and Iqra, a Muslim from Turkman Gate
 anna ke anshan sthagit karne se pehle unke pramukh sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne apane lambey vaktavy main manch se logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki wo sabhi raajnneetik dalon kaa dhanyavad karte hai or saath hi logon kaa bhi jinke sadakon par aane ke kaaran sarkaar par dabaav bana
 This proposal would not have passed without the cooperation of the parties
 We thank them
 


samvidhan logon ne banaaya he or sabase upar log hai jiske baad samvidhan, sansad or saansad aate hai
 The laws in Parliament were made according to the wishes of the people
 anna yaa anna kaa andolan samvidhan ke kilaaf nahin he jaisaa ki team ke bare main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he

 a dispute has been going on between India and Pakistan since the Partition for the right over the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 1947 main bharat-pakistan ke bich pratham yuddh bhi kashmir ke liye hi hua tha
 Pakistan started this battle by sending its soldiers as infiltrators in the hope that the people of Kashmir would revolt against India

 Since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, there were many issues going on between India and Pakistan, although the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was the biggest in it, but there were other border disputes, the most prominent of which was the Rann of Kutch, which was a It was a barren area, was on the partition of 20 march 1965 main pakistan ke dwaara jaanboojh kar kuccha ke ran main jhadpen shuru kar di gayi
 Initially they included only the Border Security Force, but later the army of both the countries also joined the war
 On 1 June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson stopped the fight between the two sides by a fair arbitral court to resolve the dispute
 Established is nyaayalay ne kuccha ke ran kii kareeb 900 varg kilometre jagah pakistan ko de di
 However, Pakistan claimed 3500 square kilometers
 
 Encouraged by the success of the Kutch run, Pakistani politicians, especially the then Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, pressured the President and the Chief of Army Staff General Ayub Khan to order an attack on Kashmir
 bharat us samay china se yuddh haar chukaa tha or unka maananaa tha ki bharat us samay yuddh karne kii sthiti main nahin tha
 Apart from this, Bhutto and other generals agreeing with his view, Yahya Khan and Tikka Khan also believed that the people of Kashmir were willing to merge with Pakistan by liberating from India and would revolt in support of them when the soldiers were disguised as infiltrators
 aakhir general ayub khan dabaav main aa gayi or unhone gupt sainik abhiyaan oparation jibraltar kaa aadesh de diya
 The main objective of this campaign was to incite rebellion among the people of Kashmir and damage the Indian communication system and transport system

 On August 5, 1965, between 26000 and 3 xxrep 4 0 Pakistani soldiers crossed the Line of Control in the dress of the local population of Kashmir and entered Indian Kashmir

 Pakistan launched a new campaign Operation Grand Slam to ease the pressure on Muzaffarabad

 The purpose of this campaign was to break the Kashmir Valley's connectivity with the rest of India so that its logistics and communication system was disrupted
 pakistan ke is akraman ke liye bharat taiyaar nahin tha or pakistan ko baari sankhya main sainiko or behatar kism ke tanko kaa laabh mil rahaa tha
 In the beginning, India had to face heavy damage, on which the Indian Army used an aerial attack, in response, Pakistan attacked the air base of Punjab and Srinagar
 yuddh ke is charan main pakistan atyadhik behatar sthiti main tha or is apratyaashit hamale se bhartiya kheme main ghabrahat fail gayi thi
 The passing of Akhnoor into the hands of the Pakistani Army could have posed a threat to the Kashmir Valley of India

 Despite the delay of a day, the army chief of the Western Command of India knew that Pakistan was in a very good position and to stop it, he gave a proposal to the then Chief of Army Staff General Chaudhary to open a new front in the Punjab border and attack Lahore
 Be given

 On September 6, India crossed the international border and attacked the Western Front and made the official start of the war

 India succeeded in crossing the canal near Barki village in retaliation

 Meanwhile, Pakistan attacked Khemkaran to reduce the pressure on Lahore and captured it
 In return, India attacked Bedi and its surrounding villages

 They immediately crossed the border and reached the Ichogil Canal, the Pakistan Army deployed defense teams on the bridges, the bridges which could not be saved were blown up, this move of Pakistan stopped the Indian army moving forward

 On the same day, the Pakistan Army, with the help of armored unit and air force, made a large counter attack on the 15th section of the Indian Army, although it caused only minor damage to the 3 Jats but the 15th segment had to retreat and its logistics and weapons vehicles were severely damaged

 9 sitambar ke baad kii ghatnaon ne dono deshon kii senaao ke sabase garvit khando kaa dambh chur chur kar diya
 The 1st Armored Division of India, called the Pride of the Indian Army, attacked in the direction of Sialkot

 Encouraged by this, Pakistan's army attacked the Indians and entered further into the Indian border
 apane antim aakraamak ke liye pakistan apane pehla bakhtarband divijan or 11vaan infantry divijan ke saath amritsar par kabje ke iraade se khemkaran par hamalaa kar diya
 According to him, after Amritsar, according to the statement from Jalandhar and then President Ayub Khan, Delhi would be the next target

 And here, between them, the second largest tank battle was fought after World War, in which Pakistan suffered a tremendous defeat

 Where before, the advancing Pakistani army lost in the war of the real north, the balance of war was tilted in favor of India
 iske baad yah jagah america main bane paton naam ke pakistani tanko ke upar paton nagar ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war

 In the battle 3000 Indian Army and 3800 Pakistani Army soldiers were martyred

 The Indian state had fertile areas of Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir, while Pakistan occupied the barren areas of Sindh and Chamba
 is yuddh main aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bhartiya vaayu sena evam pakistani vaayu sena ke vimaanon ne ek dusre kaa muqabla kiya
 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke paas badi sankhya main hoker hunter, bharat main nirmit folland nait, de havilland vempaire, i i canberra bamavarshak or mig-21 kii ek squadran thi
 The Pakistani Air Force's fadter planes were 102 F-86F sabers and 12 F-104 starfighters, and 24 B-57 Canberra bombers
 sangharsh ke dauraan bharat or pakistan vaayu senaaon kaa anupaat 5:1 tha
 However, the two air forces were similar in the war, as most of the Indian Air Force was stationed east to avoid the possibility of China entering the war
 pakistani vimaan zyaadaatar america the, jabaki bharat ke paas soviet va europea vimaanon kaa mila jula bedaa tha
 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better
 yuddh main pakistan kii nan0 19 squadran kaa netritv karne vaale air commander sajaad haidar ke anusaar- haalaanki bhartiya vayusena ke vempaire fiter vimaan F-86 saibar ke mukaable puraane or kamazor the, lekin hunter vimaan shakti evam gati donon main hi unase behatar the
 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"
 pakistan vayusena kaa F-104 starfiter upmahadweep main us samay kaa sabase tej gati kaa fiter vimaan tha or use praayah "pakistan vayusena kaa garv" kaha jaataa tha
 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft
 To fight
 atah ye us samay ke maahaul ke upyukt nahin the
 "the Indian Air Force was worried because of Starfighter, but they did not prove to be as effective in the fight as the slower but more agile, Folland Nat Fighter
 phir bhi saibar or nats ke bich chale dwand yuddh main supersonic gati ke saath, saibar kahi zyada safal rahaa
 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them
 pakistani vayusena kaa daawa tha ki usne bharat ke 104 vimaan giraae or apane 19 vimaan khoe, jabaki bhartiya vayusena ne daawa kiya ki unhone pakistan ke 73 vimaan giraae or apane 35 vimaan khoe
 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time
 pakistan vayusena ke keval ek squadran ko khone ke daavon ko, bhartiya sutron ne nakaarte hue bataaya he ki, pakistan ne shuruuaati yuddh ke 10 dinon ke bheetar hi indonesia, iraq, iran, turki or china se atirikt vimaan hasil karne kii maang kii thi
 According to independent sources, the PAF had lost some 20 aircraft while the Indians had lost 60–75 aircraft
 pakistan ne yuddh kii samaapti tak apni 17 pratishat agrim pankti kii takat kho di, jabaki bharat kaa nuksaan 10 pratishat se bhi kam tha
 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent
 1965 ke yuddh main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad tinkon ke sabase bade yuddh lade gaye
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 The analysis and analysis of the organ suffixes of any "language" is called "grammar", such as the analysis and interpretation of the body part suffix "physiology" and the description of a country, etc
 "geography"
 yani vyakaran kisi bhashaa ko apane aadesh se nahin chalaata ghumata, pratyut bhashaa kii sthiti pravriti prakat karata he
 "moves" is a verb and everyone reads it the same way without reading grammar; Let's understand its true meaning
 vyakaran is pad kaa vishleshan karke batayega ki isamen do avyav hai - "chalata" or "he"
 Then he will also analyze these two ingredients and tell that "chala" and "hai" also have their components
 "chal" main do varna spasht hai; parantu vyakaran spasht karegaa ki "c" main do akshar he "ch" or "a"
 Similarly "L" and "A" in "L"
 ab in aksharon ke tukade nahin ho sakate; "akshar" hai ye
 Grammar will also classify these letters, "consonants" and "vowels"
 "ch" or "l" vyanjan hai or "a" swar
 The vowels in Chi, Chi and Li, Li are "I" and "E", consonants "ch" and "L"

 ) Where was the first "grammar" science born in the world? sansar ke bhashavidon ne ekamat se sweekaar kiya he ki is prithvi par uplabdh sahitya main sabase pracheen veda he
 The Rigveda is the oldest literature in the world
 jab koi bhashaa sahitya kii samruddhi se jagamagane lagati he, tab uske vyakaran kii jarurat padati he
 What important literature is "veda", it can be understood from this that man has embraced it for so many days and has protected it like life
 uske prayek mantra ko yathasthit rup main kanthsth rakhana or bahut kuch uski "dhwani" surakshit rakhana saral kaam nahin he
 The ascetic Brahmins have protected the Vedas by chewing dried gram
 tabhi to ve bane rahe
 Grammar of important literature like Vedas was needed
 vyakaran ke sahare sudur desh pradeshon ke gyanpipasu kahin anyatra udbhut sahitya ko samaj sakate hai or anant kaal biit jane par bhi log use samajhane main sakasham rahete hai
 Literature like Vedas is not bound by the boundaries of the country; Hence enlightened "dev" people prayed to their king- "the grammar of our language should be formed
 aap hamaari bhashaa kaa vyakaran bana den
 "till then the Vedbhasha was" avyakrita "; this is how people were using it
 indra ne "varam" kahkar devon kii prarthana sweekaar kar lee or phir padon ko bich se tod todakar prakruti pratyay aadi kaa bhed kiya-vyakaran ban gaya
 Thus the first "grammar" lore in India was born
 vyakaran se bhashaa kii gati nahin rukati, jaisaa pehle kaha gaya he; or na vyakaran se vah badalati hi he
 Does the geography of a country state change its movement there? Language moves at its own pace
 vyakaran uskaa na niamak he, na avarohak hi
 Yes, after a thousand years, when a language comes into some other form, then grammar becomes unusable for this
 tab is kaa pruthak vyakaran banegaa
 That old grammar will still not become useless; Will continue to give an accurate introduction to that old language
 yah saadhaaran upyogita nahin he
 Yes, if someone makes the grammar of a language wrong by his ignorance, then it will be wrong
 bhashaa uskaa anugaman na karegi or yon us vyakaran ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karne par bhi bhashaa ko koi galat na kah degaa
 a grammar of Sanskrit also rules the term "punkshu" with "punsu"; But he was left there
 kabhi kisi ne "punkshu" nahin likhaa bolaa
 Panini described the word "sage" as a monk; Like "labor" "rest"
 parantu sanskrit sahitya main "vishram" chalata rahaa; chal rahaa he or chalata rahegaa
 Language has a tendency
 jab panini hi bhashaa ke pravaah ko na roak sake, to dusron kii ginati hi kya
 Grammar and linguistics are two terms; The scope of the two is different; But both are partners of each other
 vyakaran padprayog maatr par vichaar karata he; jab ki bhashavigyaan "pad" ke mul rup kii utpatti vyutpatti yaa vikaas kii paddati batalaata he
 The grammar will state that the form of "no" becomes "a" or "an"
 vyanjanadi shabdon main "a" or swaradi main "an" hota he - "adwitiya", "anupam"
 When there is dominance in prohibition, then there is no conciliation - "brahmin naasti", "asya upma nasti"
 anyatra "abrahmana: vedadhyayane mandadaraa: santi" or "anupaman kashmirsaundarya drushtam" aadi main samaas hoga; kyonki nishedh vidheyatmak nahin he
 The grammar will tell the compound and where the compound will be fine, not where; All this is the work of Batalana "sahitya Shastra"
 "na" se vyanjan udhakar "a" rah jaataa he or varnatya se "an" ho jaataa he
 This "an" has been recited by the Hindi for "samas" in the form of "an" - "anhoni", "unknown" etc
 "na" ke ye vividh rup vyakaran bana nahin detaa; bane banaae roopon kaa vah "anvakhyaan" bhar karata he
 It is the work of linguistics to shed light on these forms of "no"
 vyakaran batalaayegaa ki kisi dhaatu se "na" bhavvaachak pratyay karke usamen hindi kii sangyavibhakti "aa" laga dene se bhavvaachak sangyaayen ban jaati hai-aana, janaa, uthanaa, baithna aadi
 But the function of grammar is not to explain the evolution of metals like come, go, rise, sit etc
 yah kaam bhashavigyaan kaa he
 In Sanskrit such nouns are used in the eunuch class - Adhinavam, Gamanam, Utthanam, Upavashanam etc
 parantu hindi main puprayog hota he-"aapkaa aana kab hua?" hindi ne puprayog kyon kiya, yah vyakaran na batayega
 He will fill in the rhyme - "such nouns hold a masculine form" Enough! It is linguistic work to explain why this happened! jab koi bhashaa kisi duusari bhashaa se koi shabd leti he, to use apane shashan main chalaati he - apane vyakaran ke anusaar uski gati niyantrit karti he
 The word "dhoti" in Hindi went to English, so there it had to introduce English grammar
 prayog hota he angreji main - "brinrag avar dhotij"
 The plural of "dhoti" will not work there
 "bring avar dhotiyaan" prayog vahaan galat samajha jayega
 Similarly, the Hindi word "foot" was taken by Hindi and kept under his rule
 angreji main "foot" kaa bahuvachan "feet" hota he; par hindi main angreji vyakaran na chalegaa
 Used - "four feet height", "four feet height" is incorrect
 "oonchaai" bhi galat he; "unchaai" shuddh he
 Is the "height"; Not "low altitude"
 sanskrit main ikarant shabdon ke dwivachan ikarant ho jate hai- "kavi samagtau"; hindi main aisa na hoga
 Will be called "two poets came"
 isi tarah sanskrit main "rajdpanti samagtau"
 "rajdampati" everywhere in Hindi
 parkeey shabdon ko aatmsaat karne kii yah bhi ek prakriya he ki anamel rup ko kaat chhantakar apane mail kaa bana lenaa
 The Hindi word "ganga Ji" went to English; By creating "ganzies"
 angreji "lenturn" shabd hindi ne liya; par "laalaten" banaakar or "hospital" ko "aspataal" banaakar
 "hospital" is also incorrect in Hindi
 "hospital" or "doctor" jaise rup hindi ko grahya nahin
 The grammar of Hindi will regulate that there is no pronunciation in Hindi, which is manifested by placing the reverse tone on the vowel
 yahan "master" kii hi tarah doctor" chalata he
 Yes, if you want to write English language in Nagari script then it will work in reverse - The Doctor Was Fullish "

 In India, although this system was no stranger to British rule since its inception in the country, it became increasingly more prevalent after the First and Second World Wars in the 20th century; Especially after the independence of the country, when the ruling political party adopted the structure of socialist society as the national goal
 prashaskeey nyaay bharat main in dinon ek upyogi kaary kar rahaa he
 To protect the law, it is not necessary that only the General Courts have the monopoly of decision of cases
 prashaskeey nyaayalayon kaa sahaara liye bina aaj kaa rajyatantr apane uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah bhaleebhanti nahin kar saktaa
 When the concept of a state with a free trade takes the place of the idea of a welfare state, then it is the responsibility of the state to present the minimum physical conditions necessary for the development of the personality of the common people
 is siddhant ko apnaane ke liye yah pehla kadam uthaanaa aavashyaktha ki bina minamekh ke mukt vyapaar kii niti apnaane se utpann anyaayon kaa uchchhed kiya jaay
 Most of this work could only be done by legislation
 udhaaharan ke liye ham qaraar athwa anubandh kii swatantraaa ko len jo vyaktivaadee rajya kaa ek maanya siddhant he, to ham paayenge ki iske parinamswaroop bahuterey maamalon main, audyogic tathaa graamy mazdooron kii sthiti vastut: daason jaisi hi ho jaati he
 Large-scale factionalism among producers also creates all the evils of monopoly, which increases the likelihood of consumers being superseded

 The gradual acceptance of the democratic system of governance and universal sovereignty as the main means for establishing such a regime is indicative of the poor man's voting and thus his decisive importance in politics
 in sab kaa samshtigat parinaam yah hua ki janata dwaara chune gaye vidhanmandalon par, jo adhikaron se sampann kiye gaye the, yah jimmedaari bhi aa gai ki ve un taatkaalik samasyaon kaa hal bhi dhudhen jo raashtra ke saamne upasthit thim
 In order to protect their domestic industry, it was necessary to prevent international rivalries not favorable
 kisi desh main railway margo kaa failaayaa janaa use sabhy banane kii disha main pratham charan ke samaan he, tathaa railway ke upyog ke liye uski daren tai karne ko ek prashaskeey nyaayaadhikaran kaa hona bhi lajimi he
 The importance of taxation increased
 pehle bhoomikar evam seemashulk or phir anya sabhi prakaar ke kar bhi, visheshtya iskar, kanoonee vyavastha ke ang ban gaye
 Due to the situation of overproduction of some commodities and underproduction of some, there was a demand for regulation of production
 utpaadan ke do angon arthath poonji evam shram ke bich honevaale lagaataar jhagadon ne baraabar gatirodh kaa bhay utpann kiya or aise jhagadon ko tay karne ke liye ek vishesh vyavastha kii teevr aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 It was considered necessary to pay attention to the waste and those who carry more work load
 un mazdooron ko jinhen kaam karte samay koi kshati uthaani padi ho, uchit muaavja dena aavashyak samajha gaya tathaa aise har ek maamle main adaayagi or muaavje kii maatra sthir karne ke prashnon ko lekar jo bhi maamle uth khadey hon unka nirnay karne ke liye bhi adhikariyon kii niyukti aavashyak samajhi gai
 Increase in population, expansion of cities and industrialization etc
 created such congestion in cities that it was common for landlords to charge expensive fares
 at: kiraayon par niyantran jaruri ho gaya
 The problems of fixing cheap fares, forcible removal of houses and settling tenants in vacant houses etc
 were the natural result of such situation
 rajya ke vyaktivaadee athwa unmukt vyapaar ke siddhant ke antargat tathaa saamaanya nyaayalayon ke sammukh, nij maamalon par saarvajanik hiton kii apeksha adhik dhyaan diya jaataa tha
 It is now felt that protecting the public interest is more important, for example the removal of slums, more important than the private interests of the owners of dirty houses
 chaalu nyaayalayon se bhinn prakaar kii ek nyaayik vyavastha aavashyak samajhi gai jo aise sansar kii darshanik pariklpana karti thi jisamen asvachh naaliyaan na hon, bina bahawale siver na hon, dooshit pani dene kii vyavastha na ho, aswasthkar makaanon kaa abhaav ho, baar baar bijli fail hone kii ghatnaayen na hon tathaa jalaane ke liye samuchit gas kaa abhaav na ho, jahaan udyogtantr arakshit na ho, jahaan majdoor upekshit na hon tathaa bachche laaparvaahee kaa shikar na hon or adhik umravaale buudhon kii mitti paleed na ho
 For various reasons, the Common Courts of the country prove to be imprudent or inappropriate in giving decisions for the innumerable questions in the above list whose decision has been made by law
 audyogic jhagadon yaa mazdooron ke muaavje sambandhi vivaadon main, yahan tak ki shahar ke kiraayedaaron tathaa makaan maalikon ke jhagadon yaa mazdooron ke muaavje sambandhi vivaadon main, apekshaakrit garib majdoor tathaa lagaan denevaale kaashtkaar saamaanya adaalaton kii dhimi tathaa mahangi kaarywahi kaa baari kharch nahin uthaa sakate
 It was expected to give rise to an expeditious and accessible system than the normal courts
 parinamswaroop shram, bhaade, tathaa audyogic jhagadon sambandhi nyaayaadhikaran sthapit kiye gaye
 Under the Industrial Tribunals of India, those involved in industrial disputes and the courts of judicial consideration, commissioners of workers' compensation, officials paying wages and inspectors of the factory are also involved who have to decide the number of things that the mill owners are concerned with
 And legal rights of workers
 jab jhagada kisi aise vishay ke sambandh se hota he jisamen nyaayadhikari mahoday ko vivek se kaam lene kii yathesht chhot rahati he yaa jahaan maamle ko tay tamaam karne ke liye kitne hi sambhavit samaadhaanon main se ek ko chunanaa padataa he
 It is clear that for the general legal courts, who have a habit of applying the prescribed legal principles to a case, such cases may seem unfamiliar to some
 jab vyapaar ke kshetra main nirnaayak ko rashtriya suraksha athwa antarrashtriya kootneeti kii ore bhi dhyaan dena padataa he, tab use aise adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo hameshaa badalati rahanevaali sthitiyon kii maangon ke saath mail kha saken yaa unpar lagu ho saken
 The Export Export Duty Board and executive officers equipped with prohibitive detention rights are, according to the above logic, more suitable than the normal courts to perform such duties
 karmchaariyon ke rashtriya bime sambandhi daawey tathaa vivaad itani adhik sankhya main hone sambhav hai ki yadi saamaanya adaalatein un sabhi par vichaar karne lag jaayan to ve or koi kaam kar hi na sakengi
 Take, for example, the case of obtaining a permit for a particular route under the Motor Riding Act
 etdarth kisi nirnay par pahunchne ke liye kshetreey parivahan vibhaag tathaa parivahan sambandhi sunwaayee vibhaag ko bahuteri choti badi baton par gaur karnaa pad saktaa he jo, sambhav he, kaaphi jatil evam pravidhik dhang kii hon
 General courts will not be able to consider them as such
 aise maamalon par vichaar karne ke liye nyayadhishon se pruthak koti ke vyaktiyon ko nyaayadhikaar sampann kiya jaataa he or nyaay kii kaarywahi saamaanya adaalaton se alag kinhin jagahon par sampann hoti he
 Due to the specificity of these cases, they have to be handed over mainly to the same government officials who do the work of administration
 in prakaar, prakashkon dwaara kii janevaali nyaay kii yah sari karrwahee samshti rup se 'prashaskeey nyaay' kahalaane lagi hai
 When each such administrative officer got jurisdiction and the system of administrative justice started; So there were many characteristics of this system: low cost, quickness, flexibility, specific knowledge, lack of the nitty-gritty of decision making and freedom from the technical rules of evidence: and it was only due to which its initial establishment was strengthened
 It started to happen that there are many errors in this also
 ye prashaasak nyaayadhish bahut se maamalon main kuch aise mahatvapurn niyamon kii budhimatta ke prati bekhbar hote the, jaise bina sunwaayee ke kisi ko bhi doshi na tehraaya jaay tathaa keval suni sunai baton ke aadhaar par hi faisla karnaa khatarnaak he
 In the rush to fulfill their responsibility entrusted by the Legislature to make reforms, they sometimes behaved rudely towards the matters of private ownership that came up
 jab vidhaan mandal ne in nyaayaadhikrnon evam padaadhikariyon dwaara kiye gaye nirnyon ko antim manyata dene ke liye kadam uthaane kaa praytn kiya to janata main is sambandh main ek tarah ke bhay kii bhaavana utpann ho gai
 The reason was that with this system, the general courts had no right to interfere in these decisions, even if these judgments were directly illegal or arbitrary
 jab koi kendriya vibhaag kisi maamle kaa faisla karata tha to ekarupata uski ek spasht visheshta hoti thi
 But when there was a lack of a Central Tribunal to reconsider to explain the true meaning of a legal nugget, in such a situation, the various judicial courts having equal jurisdiction were in conflict, and there was no way to reconcile them
 used to go
 vibhinn kshetron main prashaskeey nyaay kii ye kuch trutiyaan batalaai jaati hai : saavdhaanee ke saath tathyon kii chaanbin na karnaa, sakshya ke kuch aadharbhoot siddhanton kii upeksha, maamle kii khuli adaalat main sunwaayee kii vyavastha na hona, tarkyukt nirnyon kaa na de sakna tathaa unka vivaran prastut karne main dhilaai aadi
 Apart from these errors, one of the main drawbacks is that there is no provision to control them by the general high courts of the country
 phir bahut se lokapradhikariyon main nyaayadhish kaa kaam tathaa mukadmaa chalaanevaale kaa kaam ek hi vyakti ke jimme rahata he
 The inner formation of these new institutions established for social development is also so diverse that it is very difficult to describe them by placing them in the general category
 yah vibhinnata samvidhan kii 262veen dhara ke antargat ant: pradeshy jal 'ayog' tathaa 307veen dhara ke antargat pradeshy vaanijya adhikari jaise prashasnic nyaayaadhikrnon se lekar sthaneey swaittashasan vidhaan ke anusaar nagarpalikaon dwaara gathit sampattikar sambandhi maamalon kii apil sunanevaale adhikari tak ke bich vyaapt he
 If we take the law related to income tax alone, we will find that the authority to give decision in disputes between the person paying the income tax and the government would be divided in the Income Tax Officer, the Commissioner of Reconsideration, the Commissioner of Income Tax and the Court of Appeal for matters relating to income tax etc
 is
 ye sabhi adhikari kendriya sarkaar dwaara niyukt hote hai
 Their functioning varies in different ways at different levels and the Tribunal reconsidering the appeal of income tax works in the same manner as normal legal courts
 yah punarvichaarak nyaayaadhikaran anek vyaktiyon se milakar banataa he jisamen ganak sadsy tathaa vidhigya sadsy samaan sankhya main hote hai or sabake upar ek adhyaksh hota he
 Other courts are made up of single people
 koi kanoonee masalaa paidaa hone par punarvichaar nyaayaadhikaran dwaara kiye gaye faisle ke sambandh main ucchtar nyaayalay se nivedan kiya ja saktaa he
 The tribunals formed under the sales tax law of various states are formed and formed only on the specimens formed by the Income Tax Act
 desh main jo vibhinn nyaayaadhikaran kaam kar rahe hai unke nirnyon par punarvichaar karne ke liye koi nyaayalay nahin he
 Necessary reconsideration is now done after obtaining specific permission to appeal as per section 136 of the Constitution
 uparyukt nyaayaadhikrnon ke adhikari puure samay kaam karanevaale afasar hote hai
 But the officers of the Regional Transport Department and State Transport Department falling within the Motor Riding Act are both government and gas government part-time
 kuch anya adhikariyon ke liye, jinhen maamalon kaa nipataara karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya he, salaahkaar samitiyon kii vyavastha kii gai he
 There is no fixed structure of the size type of these tribunals
 gaiyrsarkari sadasyon ke liye itane paarishramik kii vyavastha nahin hoti ki upyukt vyakti is ore aakarshith ho saken
 For many administrative tribunals, the necessary qualifications are often not determined
 isamen andeh nahin ki prashaskeey nyaay kii vyavastha, jisaki ruparekha upar di gai he, desh main sthaayee rup se kaayam rahane ke liye hi kii gai he
 Now the question is, what corrections and modifications should be done to remove the errors which are seen in it and to make the system more efficient
 england or america main 1930 se 1960 tak ke dauraan prashaskeey nyaay kii pranali main anek anusandhan hue or usamen bahut se sudhaar kiye gaye
 Three research committees can be discussed in this regard: the Committee of the Attorney General set up in the United States for administrative work, the Special Committee for the Rights of Ministers in England, and the Committee of Administrative Courts and Administrative Inquiries, etc
 inamen se antim ne kuch vishisht gunon yaa baton par bal diya yatha, nirvagrahata, nyaayochity evam nishpakshta nirnyon kii pushti main tark dena, nirnyon ko prakashit karnaa tathaa un pramaanon ko udghaatit karnaa jinke aadhaar par pratikul nirnay prashaskeey nyaayaadhikrnon dwaara saamaanya sweekruti ke liye kiye jate hai
 In England, the headlines of these suggestions were incorporated into laws, with few exceptions
 bharat main is samasya ko lekar koi vyapak khojbin nahin hui he
 The Law Commission of India also could not fully consider this problem
 bhartiya samvidhan kii 32veen, 136veen tathaa 226veen dhaaraon main in prashaskeey nyaayaadhikrnon ko ek had tak niyantrit rakhane kii vyavastha he
 The 32nd section empowers the court to issue orders or orders to any public authority or government itself to enforce the basic rights practically
 uskaa yah kaary habiyas carpus, madesus, pratishedh pradesh aadi kii shakl main ho saktaa he
 The 226th section provides such legal rights to the High Courts through which they can not only implement basic rights but also other legal rights and objectives
 136veen dhara sarvocch nyaayalay ko yah adhikaar detii he ki vah apni nirnay buddhi ke anusaar kisi bhi nyaayaadhikaran ke nirnay ke vishay main kii gai apil par vichaar kar sake 
 There is no uniformity other than these in the field of administrative justice in India
 is puure kshetra main sthiti kii samiksha ke liye ucchadhikaar sampann ayog kii aavashyaktaa he
 It will be the duty of the said commission to give its decision on various questions out of which many have been discussed above
 kuch aavashyak prashn jinka ullekh yahan vishesh rup se kiya janaa chahie, ye hai: kisi vibhaag ke mukadmaa chalaanevaale anubhag ko nyaayik nirnay kaa kaary karanevaale anubhag se alag kar die jane kii aavashyaktaa, nyaaydhikaranon main aise swatantra sadasyon kii niyukti kii aavashyaktaa jinke sammukh sarkari vibhaagon ke adhikariyon yaa karmchaariyon ko aavedaar athwa mukadmaa chalaanewaalon ke rup main baar baar upasthit hona pade; maamalon kii sunwaayee khule rup se kii jaay; tathaa ant main, jo sabase mahatvapurn he, yah ki prashaskeey apilen sunanevaale aise nyaayalay kii sthapana kii jaay jo bharat ke sarvocch nyaayalay kaa hi ang ho, ore jiske nyaayasabhyon main anbhavi naagarik padaadhikari bhi shaamil hon

 The main diseases that are treated by handicapped surgery are: jodon kii vyaadhiyaan : ye vyaadhiyaan jeevanvik sankraman, yaa kshati, jaise asthibhang, khatarnaak moch, yaa barambar honevaali kshati ke kaaran hoti hai
 Bone disease can be caused by infection or damage

 vibhinn shalyakarmi prakriyaaon dwaara bhagn khandon ko sidh main laayaa ja saktaa he or sui, taar yaa dhatvik stepalon dwaara unhen samuchit sthiti main rakhkar swasth kiya ja saktaa he
 Infection of bones and joints is influenced by antibiotics
 yah santosh kii baat he, parantu jab sankraman chirkaalik ho jaataa he, tab pratijaiviki utakon tak nahin pahonchte
 As a result, there are indexable changes that limit the movement of the joints and cause deformities
