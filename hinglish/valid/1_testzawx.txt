 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded

 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time संयुक्त राष्ट्र intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, भारत had the better of the war
 नई दिल्ली achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, भारत budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the संयुक्त राष्ट्र Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, भारत reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 दिसम्बर killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 फ़रवरी 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani एयर मार्शल व कमाण्डर इन चीफ of PAF during the war, नूर खान, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, भारत agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, भारत was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, भारत did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 Magnet therapy is a medical practice
 isaki do paddatiyaan prachlit hai- sarvadaihik arthath hatheliyon va talvon par lagane se tathaa sthanik arthath rogagrast bhaag par lagane se
 According to this, based on the electrical correlation of the body by taking a pair of North Pole and South Pole magnets, the North Pole magnet is usually used on the right side, forward and northern parts of the body, while the South Pole magnet
 It is used on the left parts of the body, on the back and on the lower parts
 yah atal niyam chumbakon ke sarvadaihik prayog par hi lagu hota he, jabaki sthanik prayog kii avasthaa main rog sankraman, dard, sujan aadi par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 isamen chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used
 jaise ghutane tathaa gardan ke tej dard main do chumbakon ko alag-alag ghutanon par tathaa tisare chumbak ko gardan kii dardanaak kasheruka par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The method of this experiment is also useful in the case of endemic disease infection
 anguthe main tej dard hone jaisi kuch avasthaaon main kabhi-kabhi donon chumbakon ke dhruvon ke bich angutha rakhane se turant aaraam miltaa he
 Mainly, two methods of magnetic therapy are prevalent - 1
 Applying the universal means on the palms and soles and 2
 Applying on the local area ie the diseased part
 inkaa varnan yahan diya ja rahaa he - According to this method, a pair of magnets filled with the North Pole and South Dhruva is taken
 sharir ke vidyutiya sahasambandh ke aadhaar par saamanyatya uttari dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke daayen bhaagon par, aage kii ore va uttari bhaagon par kiya jaataa he, jabaki dakshini dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke baayein bhaagon par, peeth par tathaa nichle bhaagon par kiya jaataa he
 This firm rule applies only to the universal use of magnets, while in the case of endemic use, more attention is given to disease infection, pain, swelling etc
 uttam parinaam hasil karne ke liye jab rog athwa uskaa prasar sharir ke upree bhaag arthath naabhi se upar ho to chumbakon ko hatheliyon par lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki sharir ke nichle bhaagon arthath naabhi se neeche vidyaman rogon main chumbakon ko talvon main lagaaya jaataa he
 In this method of application, magnets are placed in places that are diseased, such as the knees and feet, painful vertebrae, eyes, nose, etc
 inamen rog kii tivrata tathaa rup ke anusaar ek, do or yahan tak ki teen chumbakon kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, in severe pain of knee and neck, two magnets can be applied on different knees and third magnet can be applied on painful vertebrae of neck
 is prayog vidhi kii upyogita sthanik rog sankraman kii avasthaa main bhi hoti he
 In some situations like severe pain in the thumb, sometimes keeping the thumb between the poles of both magnets gives instant relief
 yah har aayu ke nar-naariyon ke liye gunakari he
 Treatment through magnets is so simple that it can be tried at any time, anywhere and on any part of the body
 purush ho yaa stri, jawan ho yaa boodha, sabhi isse labhanvit ho sakate hai
 The magnetism improves blood circulation; If the magnet is in contact with the body for some time, heat is produced in the body, all its functions are improved and blood circulation increases
 is kaaran saare sharir ko shakti milti he, rog dur hone main sahaayta milti he, thakaavat or durbalata dur hoti he, jisase rogi sheeghra swasthya laabh karata he or sharir ke prayek ang kii pidaa or sujan bhi dur ho jaati he
 In some cases, this method is so powerful and its effect is so rapid that it is often enough to eliminate the disease forever
 kai maamalon main duusari baar chumbak lagane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin padati
 Such as in tooth aches and sprains etc
 pehle se taiyaari jaruri nahin ek hi chumbak kaa anek vyakti upyog kar sakate hai
 They do not need to be cleaned, washed, or sterilized
 yadhyapi twachaa ke sankramak rog kii chikitsa main jis chumbak kaa upyog hua ho, uski safai kerani padati he
 If you have used a thin cloth cover then there is no question of cleaning the magnet, just cleaning the cloth is sufficient
 isaki lat nahin padati chumbak ke upachaar kii aadat nahin padati or uskaa upyog achaanak band kar diya jaae to bhi koi mushkil khadi nahin hoti
 Magnet pulls the pain from the body
 Every disease must have some kind of pain
 pidaa chaahe kisi kaaran se ho, chumbak main use ghataane, balki samaapt tak karne kaa gun he
 With his help, all body functions become normal
 isi kaaran sabhi rogon par chumbakon kaa prabhaav padataa he, pidaa dur ho jaati he or sharir kii kriyaaon ke vikaar thik ho jate hai
 The size and design of the magnet will depend on which part of the body it is mounted on
 sharir ke kuch ang aise hai, jahaan bade aakaar ke chumbak nahin lag sakate, kuch angon par chote chumbak thik se kaam nahin karenge
 For example, if a magnet is to be applied to the eye, it should be a small size circular magnet, which comes over the closed eye
 duusari ore agar sharir ke adhiktar bhaagon main pidaa yaa sujan he to bade aakaar kaa chumbak lagegaa
 Therefore, the same size-type magnet cannot be used on different parts of the body
 chumbakon kii shakti par bhi yahi baat lagu hoti he
 Some soft parts of the body such as brain, eye and heart should not be fitted with high power magnets nor should medium power magnets be installed for a long time
 iske vipareet kam shakti vaale chumbak kadi or bade aakaar kii mansapeshiyon yaa haddiyon ke rogon ke liye kaaphi nahin honge, jaise ki kulhon, janghaaon, ghutanon yaa ediyon kii hoti hai
 These things should be kept in mind in the choice of magnets not only for local diseases but also for the whole body
 upachaar lete samay jameen athwa kisi lohe kii vastu se rogi kaa sampark na ho, yah aavashyak he
 So an iron chair or bed is forbidden, while a wooden chair or bed is ideal
 chumbakon kii sthiti is prakaar rahani chahie ki uttari dhruv uttar disha kii ore tathaa dakshini dhruv dakshin disha kii ore rahe
 This will keep the magnetic field parallel to the Earth's magnetic field and make the magnet more effective
 yadi do chumbakon ke do alag-alag dhruvon kaa prayog ek hi samay kiya ja rahaa ho to rogi kaa munh pashchim kii ore hona chahie, jisase ki uske sharir kaa dahinaa bhaag uttar kii ore tathaa baayan bhaag dakshin kii ore rahe
 It is considered appropriate that spatial or general use of magnets is expedient from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
 vayaskon ke jeern amwati sandhishoth main pehle ek saptaah tak chumbakon kaa prayog keval 10 minute tak karnaa chahie or is avadhi ko dhire-dhire 30 minute tak badha dena chahie
 In many other diseases also the time should be extended accordingly
 adhik shaktishaalee chumbakon par tadnusaar gata deni chahie
 When using magnets on the Komlang like brain, it is well understood that powerful magnets are not used in it
 chumbak kaa prayog 10 minute se adhik kabhi na kiya jaae
 However, in relation to the period, its discretion is considered to be the best
 chumbak chikitsa kaa koi pratiprabhav nahin hota
 Still, do not worry if you feel symptoms of heaviness, vertigo, vomiting, saliva dripping etc
 aise kisi lakshan ko twarit dur karnaa jaruri ho to jaste yaa tambe kii ek pattee par donon haath 20-25 minute tak rakhen
 In the condition of inflammation of the vertebral neuralgia of the knees and neck, the use of magnets on the knees for 10 minutes in the morning and the last parts of the neck and pain for 10 minutes in the evening, but in these conditions the use of magnets should be from 10 minutes
 Should not be more
 gharelu nuskhe jaan-jahaan yun rahen swasth yon samasyaayen sehat samachar jadi-bootiyaan chikitsa paddatiyaan aahaar ayurveda 1) Time of magnet use chumbakon kaa prayog karne ke liye kisi samay vishesh niyam kaa paalan karnaa jaruri nahin hota, lekin uchit rahata he yadi inkaa prayog praatavkalin shouch evam snaan aadi se nivrutt hokar athwa shaam ko rogi kii suvidhanusaar kiya jaae
 Utmost care should be taken in determining the time to use and use magnets
 anubhav bataata he ki kasheruka sandhishoth, janu sandhishoth tathaa qamar dard jaisi kuch rogavasthaayen shaareerik shram evam din kaa kaam khatm karne par shaam ko badhate hai
 Therefore, in such diseases, when magnets are used in the evening, then there is a lot of relief
 iske vipareet dast, kabjiyat tathaa badi aanton ke pradaah main chumbakon kaa prayog subah ke samay karnaa chahie
 According to Ayurveda, cough is said to be the main cause of diseases like cough, colds, colds, inflammation of respiratory tracts, pyorrhea and they increase in the morning
 pitt, amlata evam ruddhavaat jaise vaat sambandhi rog shaam ko badhate hai
 If we follow this principle, then in case of chest diseases and phlegm, magnets should be used in the morning
 yadi jigar vikaar jaise pittajnak rog hon, to chumbakon kaa prayog dopaher baad kiya janaa chahie tathaa jab pet yaa aanton ke andar hawa banati ho to chumbakon kaa prayog shaam ko kiya janaa chahie
 Every prudent magnet doctor should take all these facts into consideration when scheduling the use of magnets to his patient
 1
 chumbakon kaa prayog karte samay athwa uske turant baad icecream jaisi kisi thandi khaane-pine kii cheez kaa seven nahin kiya janaa chahie, anyathaa ve utakon par chumbakon ke prabhaav ko anaavashyak rup se kam kar dengi
 2
 Do not take magnetic treatment for two hours after meals, taking this treatment immediately after meals is likely to cause vomiting
 bhojan ke baad rakt paribhraman pet ke avyavon kii ore vishesh hota he, usamen vyavdhaan daalana uchit nahin he
 3
 Powerful magnets should not be used on pregnant women, as this sometimes leads to miscarriage
 aavashyaktaa ho to madhyam shakti tathaa alp shakti chumbakon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, lekin unhen garbhashay se dur rakhana chahie
 4
 Following the instructions given in the chapter on 'magnetic Water', the quantity of magnetic water should not be increased normally, otherwise it sometimes increases the body's activity and creates an uncomfortable situation
 bacchon ko chumbakeey jal dene par iskaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana chahie
 5
 Do not let the opposing poles of powerful magnets come in contact with each other
 kabhi aksmaat angulii bich main aa jaae to kuchal jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Also, sticking magnets are difficult to separate
 6
 upachaar ke samay sharir se gahanaa yaa aisi vastuon ko hataa dena chahie jo chumbakatv kaa shoshan kar lete hai
 Some electrical appliances and watches can also be destroyed by the impact of magnets if they are not kept away from the magnets
 atah chumbakon ko inase dur rakhana chahie
 7
 When magnets are not used, the holder should be kept on top of them and handled well
 unhen jameen par nahin giraanaa chahie, kyonki aisi asaavadhaaniyon se chumbakon kii shakti mand pad jaati he tathaa anaavashyak rup se unke punarchumbakan kii aavashyaktaa pad jaati he
 Similarly, children should not be allowed to play with magnets
 8
 shaktishaalee chumbak lagane ke do ghante baad tak nahaana nahin chahie
 For this reason, it has been said that magnetic therapy should be done after bath in the morning
 9
 chumbakon ko yathasambhav lohe ke dibbe yaa almaari main na rakhen, lakdi kii peti yaa aisa hi koi saadhan pasand karen
 10
 Make sure that the magnets do not touch the water, otherwise they get rusty
 isi prakaar sharir ke jis hisse kaa upachaar karnaa ho, use pasinarahit karnaa na bhoolen
 11
 While treating dermatitis, do not keep the magnets in direct contact with the skin and keep a thin cloth in the middle
 12
 upachaar ke samay sharir par chumbakon kaa dabaav padana aavashyak nahin he, kintu ve sthir rahen yahi dekhnaa he
 In some instances, treatment is also given by rotating magnets
 13
 bade shaktishaalee chumbakon kaa upachaar din main ek yaa do baar liya ja saktaa he, chote alpasakti chumbakon ko sharir ke hisse ke saath puure din belt ke rup main baandhakar yaa tepe se chipkaakar bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Manila Devi Temple is located in the Shult area of almora district of Uttarakhand state of India
 yah sthaan ramnagar se lagbhag 70 kimi kii duuri par sthit he
 It can be reached by bus or private vehicle
 yah is kshetra kaa ek prasidd mandir he or har varsh yahan dur-dur se log devi ke darshanon ke liye aate hai
 This temple is the temple of Manila, the family goddess of the Katyuri people
 mandir do bhaagon main banta hua he jise sthaneey bhashaa main mel manilla or tal manilla kehete he
 The ancient temple is located in Tal Manila but the story behind Mal Manila Temple which is very popular among the local people is that "once some thieves wanted to steal the idol of Manila Devi
 lekin jab wo murti uthaa rahe the to uthaa na sake or tab ve murti kaa ek haath hi ukhaad kar le gaye, lekin us haath ko bhi ve adhik dur naa lejaa sake
 "and since then another temple of Mother has been established at the same place which is known today as Mal Manila

 Bhojeshwar Temple is a temple built in a village named Bhojpur, about 30 km from Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh
 ise bhojpur mandir bhi kehete hai
 This temple is situated on a hill between the Vindhya ranges on the banks of the Betwa River
 mandir kaa nirmaan evam iske shivlinga kii sthapana dhar ke prasiddh parmaar raja bhoj ne karavaayi thi
 It is also called Bhojpur Temple or Bhojeshwar Temple after his name, though according to some legends the original temple of this place is believed to have been established by the Pandavas
 ise "uttar bharat kaa somnath" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The inscriptions here give a knowledge of the architecture of the 11th century Hindu temple construction and it is known that the dome was used even before the arrival of Islam in India
 is apurna mandir kii vrahat kaary yojana ko nikatavarti pashaan shilaon par ukera gaya he
 According to these map diagrams, there was a plan to build a large temple complex in which many other temples were also to be built
 iske safaltapurvak sampann ho jane par ye mandir parisar bharat ke sabase bade mandir parisaron main se ek hota
 The temple complex has been marked as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India and has made a successful effort to revive it by renovating it
 mandir ke baahar lage puraatatva vibhaag ke shilaalekh anusaar is mandir kaa shivlinga bharat ke mandiron main sabase unchaa evam vishaltam shivlinga he
 The entrance of this temple is also the largest among the doors of any Hindu building
 mandir ke nikat hi is mandir ko samarpit ek puraatatva sangrahalay bhi bana he
 The Bhojpur festival is organized every year by the state government on the occasion of Shivaratri
 is mat ke anusaar mata kunti dwaara bhagwaan shiv kii puja karne ke liye pandavon ne is mandir ke nirmaan kaa ek raatri main hi puraa karne kaa sankalp liya jo puraa nahin ho sakaa
 Thus, this temple is incomplete till date
 is mat ke anusaar aisi manyata he ki mandir kaa nirmaan kala, sthapaty or vidya ke mahaan sangrakshak madhya-bharat ke parmaar vansheey raja bhojdev ne 11veen shatabdi main karavaaya
 According to the traditions and beliefs, it was he who built Bhojpur and now a dam that was broken
 mandir kaa nirmaan kabhi purna nahin ho paaya, atah yahan ek shilanyas yaa udghaatan / nirmaan ankan shila kii kami he
 Nevertheless the name here is Bhojpur which is associated with the name of Raja Bhoj
 kuch manyataon ke anusaar yah mandir ek hi raat main nirmit hona tha kintu isaki chat kaa kaam puraa hone ke pehle hi subah ho gai, isliye kaam adhuraa rah gaya
 The recognition of the construction by Raja Bhoj is also supported by the artifacts of the site, whose carbon age-calculation ensured them of the 11th century itself
 bhojpur ke ek nikatavarti jain mandir main, jis par unheen shilpiyon ke pahchaan chihn hai, jinke is shiv mandir par bane hai; un par 1035 i kii hi nirmaan tithi ankit he
 Apart from many literary works, historical evidence here also confirms the rule of King Bhoja in the year 1035 AD
 raja bhoj dwaara jari kiye gaye modas tamra patr, unke raajakavi dashabal rachit chintamani saranika aadi is pushti ke sahaayak hai
 There used to be three dams and one lake in the adjacent area of this temple
 itane bade sarovar evam teen bade baadhon kaa nirmaan koi shaktishaalee raja hi karvaa saktaa tha
 All these evidences appear in favor of the temple being built by King Bhoja
 puraatatvashastri prokirit manakodi is mandir ke nirmaan kaal ko raja bhoj ke shashan ke uttarardh main, lagbhag 11veen shatabdi ke madhya kaa bataate hai
 Inscriptions written by later Parmar rulers in the Udaipur Commendation contain such references as: phrases like those filled with temples, and dedicated facts related to Shiva
 inamen kedareshwar, rameshwar, somnath, kalbhairav evam rudra kaa varnan bhi miltaa he
 According to the proverbs and traditions, he also built a Saraswati temple
 ek jain lekhak merutung ne apni kriti prabandh chintamani main likhaa he ki raja bhoj ne akele apni rajdhani dhar main hi 104 mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 However, as on date, only Bhojpur temple is the only remaining monument, which can be associated with the name of Raja Bhoj
 prabandh chintamani ke anusaar; jab raja bhoj ek baar shrimaal gayi to unhone kavi magh ko bhojaswamin naamak mandir ke bare main bataaya tha jiskaa ve nirmaan karwaane vaale the
 After this, the king returned to Malwa
 haalanki magh kavi raja bhoj ke samakaleen nahin the, atah yah katha kalbhramit prathit hoti he
 This temple was originally built on the banks of an 18
5 mile long and 7
5 mile wide lake
 is sarovar kii nirmaan yojana main raja bhoj ne pathar evam baaluu ke teen baandh banawaaye
 The first of these was built on the Betwa River, which used to hold water and there were hills in that valley from the remaining three sides
 doosraa baandh vartmaan mendua gram ke nikat do pahadiyon ke bich ke sthaan ko jodakar jal kaa nikaas roak kar rakhata tha evam teesraa baandh aaj ke bhopal shahar ke sthaan par bana tha jo ek choti mausami nadi kaaliyasot ke jal ko mode kar is betwa sarovar ko de detaa tha
 These artificial reservoirs remained until the 15th century
 ek gond kinvadanti ke anusaar malwa naresh hoshang shah ne apni sena se is band ko tudwa daalaa jisamen unhen teen maheene kaa samay lag gaya tha
 It is also told that Hoshang Shah's boy was drowned in the dam's lake and even after searching a lot, his body was not found
 naaraaz hokar usne band ko top se uda diya or mandir ko bhi top se hi gira dene kii koshish kii thi
 Due to this, the top and side part of the temple fell
 is baandh ke tut jane se sara pani bah gaya or tab is apaar jalarashi ke ekaek samaapt ho jane ke kaaran malwa kshetra main jalwaayu parivartan aa gaya tha
 Two annual fairs are also organized at this famous site on the time of Makar Sankranti and Maha Shivaratri respectively
 is samay is dharmik aayojan main bhaag lene ke liye dur dur se log yahan pahonchte hai
 The lake here extends to present day Bhopal
 mandir nirmaan main prayog kiya gaya pathar bhojpur ke hi patharile kshetron se praapt kiya gaya tha
 The remains of cutting stones and rocks are seen from near to the temple
 lekhika vidya dehejia kii pustak arli stone temples of odisha main ullekh miltaa he ki bhojpur ke shiv mandir or bhubaneshwar ke lingraj mandir va kuch or mandiron ke nirmaan main samanta dikhaai padati he
 There are many unique components in Bhojpur temple, some of which are as follows: Deletion of the pavilion from the sanctum sanctorum, straight line roof instead of the domed peak in the temple
 mandir kii bahari deevaaron main se teen bahari ore se ekadam sapaat hai, kintu ye 12veen shatabdi kii bataayi jaati hai
 After studying these unique components, a researcher Krishna Deva is of the opinion that the temple may have been related to the functions related to the funeral, etc; As can often be seen even near cremation grounds etc
 is shodh kii pushti kaalaantar main madhusudan dhaki dwaara khoje gayi kuch madhyakaalin vaastusambandhi paathya se bhi hoti he
 It is known from these fragmentary texts that after the death of many high-ranking persons, a memorial-like temple was built on their remains or funeral sites
 is prakaar ke mandiron ko swargarohan-prasaad kaha jaataa tha
 According to the text, in this type of temples, receding stone blocks are used instead of a single peak
 kirit manakodi ke anusaar bhojpur mandir kii adhirachana is praaroop par sateek baithti he
 According to his estimate, Raja Bhoj may have built this temple for his late father Sindhuraj or Tau Vakapati Munj, who died in a humiliating place in the enemy area
 yahaan dekhakar aisa prathit hota he ki nirmaan kaary ekadam se hi roak diya gaya hoga
 Though the reasons for this are still unknown, but the history of the people speculate that this may have happened due to a natural disaster, lack of supply of resources or the start of a war
 2006-07 main iske punuruddhar kaary ke armbh hone se purv imaarat kii chat bhi nahin thi
 With this, the historian KK Muhammed speculated that the roof may have collapsed during the construction period itself due to mathematical architectural defects in the correct estimation of the entire load
 tab raja bhoj ne is dosha ke kaaran ise punarnirmaan na kar mandir ke nirmaan ko hi roak diya hoga
 Historians, archaeologists and architects also get a lot of knowledge of the organizing and mechanics of the 11th century temple construction style from the evidences found from the then abandoned site
 mandir ke uttari evam purvi ore kai khadaan sthal bhi mili hai, jahaan vibhinn staron ke adhure shilp evam shilpakritiyaan bhi mili hai
 Apart from this, a huge slope has been found to carry heavy stone parts from the quarry to the top of the temple
 bahut si shilpakritiyaan khadaan se mandir ke nikat laakar aise hi rakhi hui mili hai
 They will have to be used later at the time of temple construction, but they would have been left as such after the construction stopped
 puratetvik surveykshan vibhaag ne inhen 20veen shatabdi main apane bhandar grih pahunchaa diya
 The details of the architectural plan of the temple construction are carved on the stones adjacent to the quarry part
 is yojana se gyaat hota he ki yahan ek vrahat mandir parisar banane kii yojana thi, jisamen dheron anya mandir bhi banaaye jane the
 After the successful completion of this scheme, this temple complex would have been one of the largest temple complexes in India
 mandir kii imaarat, khadaanon ke nikat evam gram ke anya do mandiron par 1300 se adhik shilpakaaron ke pahchaan chihn mili hai
 These include the names of 50 craftsmen found in different parts on the main structure of the temple
 in naamon ke alaava anya pahchaan chihn bhi hai, jaise chakra, kate hue chakra, pahiye, trishul, swastik, shankhaakriti tathaa nagari lipi ke chihn, aadi
 These signs were made for estimating or estimating the work amount of the craftsmen or their families, which were erased at the time of finalization of the building, but the temple remained as such due to the non-completion of the construction

 aisa nirantar varsha jal risaav, uske kaaran ai sillen evam aantarik suraksha lepan ke hatane ke kaaran ho rahaa tha

 He also repaired the wall on the northwest side of the temple as part of the revival drive

 During the year 2006-07, a team of KK Muhammad's subordinate department resumed the renovation work of the memorial
 unhone sanrachana ke ek tut kar hat gayi stambh ko bhi punarsthapit kiya
 This 12 tonne monolithic pillar was to be built by the artisans and craftsmen closely matching the original copy, so for this, after the countrywide search of the stone matching the original structure, the rock was brought from near Agra and the construction of this pillar Done iske banane ke baad dal ko itani lambi bhujaa vaali kraine mashin uplabdh na ho paayi, jiske abhaav main dal ne charakhiyon evam uttolkon kii ek shrunkhlaa kii sahaayta se kaary ko purna kiya

 The same team also replaced the open part of the roof of the temple with a Vastu component matching a new basic structure
 ye ghatak fibar-glass se bana hone ke kaaran ek to mul sanrachana ke us bhaag se bhaar main kahin kam he atah dhaanche par anaavashyak bhaar bhi nahin daalata he, duusare varsha-jal ke risaav ko bhi prabhavi rup se rokane main sakasham he
 After this, the department has covered the space between the walls and the component of this new roof by sloping stone blocks to eliminate water leakage on the roof from other sources
 dal ne mandir kii uttari, dakshini evam pashchimi bahari deevaaron ke anshon ko bhi naye shilpakriti pashaanon ke dwaara badal diya

 note avesta main bhi gaatha kaa vahi arth he jo vaidic gaatha kaa he arthath gey mantra yaa gati kaa
 These are five in number with 17 mantras included within them
 ye paanchon chhandon kii drushti se vargeekrut he or apane aadi akshar ke anusaar vibhinn naamon se vikhyath he
 The saga is the oldest part of the Avesta, which is also considered very important from the point of view of composition
 inke bheetar parsi dharm ke sudhaarak tathaa pratishthatmak zarathustra maanviya or aitihaasik rup main apni abhivyakti pate hai; yahan unka yah kaalpanik rup, jo avesta ke anya anshon main prachurtaa se uplabdh hota he, nitant sattahin he
 Here they are human beings walking on solid ground, in which a clear shadow of hope, despair, joy and sadness towards the works of the world is reflected
 ek dwitiya ishwar ke prati unki aasthaa nitant drudh he jo jivan ke gatisheel parivartan main bhi apni ekta tathaa satta dridhtaa se banaae rahata he
 The language of the saga is quite different from the language of other parts of the Avesta in terms of syntax, style and verses
 vidwaanon ne avesta kii bhashaa ko do staron me vibhakt kiya he: Saga avastan and arvachin avestan
 In the first of these, the introduction of the oldest language comes from the practice of these gathas, which are happy in their grammatical form and thus bear similarity to Vedic Sanskrit
 dwitiya bhashaa avaantar kaal main viksit honevaali bhashaa he jo saamaanya sanskrit bhashaa ke samaan kahi ja sakati he
 The style of the saga is interesting
 falat: avesta ke pichley bhaagon kii punrariti tathaa samarasata ke kaaran udvejak style se yah style nitant bhinn he
 The verses are also as ancient as the Vedic verses
 vishay dharmpradhan hone par bhi padon ke rochak vinyas ke kaaran in gaathaon kaa saahitiyik saundarya kam nahin he
 They appear to be lyrical because they are composed in plain words
 pishal tathaa geldonor kaa mat he ki in gaathaon main taarkik kaary-kaaran-sambandh kaa abhaav nahin he
 However, these are footballes and are his personal speeches summarizing Zarathustra's teachings, which he told to his disciple, King Vishwashp, the ruler of Bakhtri
 paigambar ke apane vachan hone se inaki pavitrataa tathaa mahatta kii kalpana swat: kii ja sakati he
 Zarathustra has strongly condemned the spirit of many gods in these gathas and has commanded the Parsi subjects to follow the orders of Almighty God, whom he calls Ahuramazd
 ve akeshwarwadi the - itane pakke ki unhone us sarvashaktiman ke liye ahurmajd naam ke atirikt anya naamon kaa sarvatha nishedh kiya he
 The clear statement of the saga is: arthath ham keval usee ko puujate hai jo apane dharm ke kaaryon se or ahurmajd ke naam se vikhyath he
 Zarathustra has clearly stated his firm faith in God in this saga: iskaa spasht arth he ki bhagwaan ke atirikt meraa anya koi rakshak nahin he
 Not only this, later in this saga he says - Mazdao Sakhare Miiri Shato means only Mazda is the only worshiper
 inke atirikt koi bhi anya devtaa upasna ke yogya nahin he
 Along with Ahuramazd, his six other forms are also imagined in these gathas
 ye vastut: aarambh main gun hi hai jin shadgunon se yukt ahurmajd kii kalpana ‘shadgunya vigrah’ bhagwaan vishnu se vishesh milti he
 In other parts of the Avesta, they have been made deities or angels and are known as Amesha Spenta
 unke naam tathaa rup kaa parichay is prakaar he: 1
 US = regulatory power of the world 2
 vohumano = prem tathaa pavitrataa 3
 Spent Armite = Religious Unity 4
 kshathraviyan = prabhutv kaa suchak 5
 Howvartat = indicator of completeness 6
 amritatat = amarta, yaa amritatv Zarathustra preached to worship Ahuramazd with these six qualities and ordered the Iranian people to protect him by considering Aatash as the physical form of God
 gaatha ahunwaiti main zarathustra kaa anya darshanik siddhant bhi sugamawa ke saath pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 That is the element of conflict between Sat and Asat, in which suppressing sat-assat proclaims its victory in the spiritual world
 sat asat ke is paraspar jagat virdohi yugal kii sangya he - ahurmajd tathaa ahriman- ahriman asat shakti kaa pratik he tathaa ahurmajd sat shakti kaa pratinidhi he
 It is the duty of the creature to save himself from the temptations of Ahriman, to obey the command of Ahuramazd, to live his life of lust because the defeat of sin and victory of virtue is inevitable
 is prakaar rahasyanubhootiyon se paripurna ye gaathaayen vishayipradhan upadeshon ke kaaran parsi dharm main apni udaatt adarshavadita ke liye sarvada se prakhyat he
 The ideal depicted in these gathas is not separate from complete monotheism

 jalakan banane ke uparaant bhi yadi vaayu kaa taap kam hote hote himank se bhi kam ho jaataa he, to jalakan himakanon kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai jisase himavarsha hoti he
 Two things are necessary for rain: varsha teen prakaar kii hoti he : The type of rainfall occurs in most equatorial regions, usually per day
 bumadhyarekha par adhik garmi padane se samudron se prachur maatra main jalawaashp banakar vaayu main mila karata he; garmi or vaashp ke kaaran ardra vaayu halki hokar upar uthati he or iskaa sthaan grahan karne ke liye anya hawaayen aati rahati hai
 The air cools up and spreads
 vaashp kii maatra adhik hone se osank tak pahunchane ke liye taap ko kam girnaa padataa he
 Hence, the vapor quickly takes the form of water and there is pouring rain usually after two o'clock every day
 is varsha ko sanvahneey varsha kehete hai
 When winds are blocked in the path of steam-laden winds, these winds have to rise, due to the effect of frozen snow on the mountains and as the air is cooled by the spread of air, the air vapor comes in the form of droplets on the ground
 ye hawaayen parvat ke duusari ore maidan main utarate hi garam ho jaati hai or aasapaas ke vaataavaran ko bhi garam kar detii he
 Similar rainfall occurs in most parts of the world
 monsooni pradeshon main bhi isi prakaar kii varsha hoti he
 This rain is called mountain rain
 is prakaar kii varsha garam or sheethal vayurasiyon ke aapas main milane se hoti he, kyonki halki garam vaayu upar uthati he tathaa baari sheethal vaayu neeche baithti he
 Therefore, the air rising up becomes cold and starts raining
 is prakaar varsha praaia: shitoshna katibandh main hua karti he
 An instrument is used to measure how much rainfall has occurred in a place, which is called a rainbow
 ise ek nishchit samay main tathaa nishchit sthaan par varsha main rakhkar pani ke barasane kii maatra ko maap liya jaataa he
 There are many types of rain gauge
 varsha adhiktar inch yaa centimetre main maapi jaati he
 a rain gauge is a hollow cylinder inside which a bottle is kept and a funnel rests on it
 varsha kaa pani keep dwaara bottle main bhar jaataa he tathaa baad main pani ko maapak dwaara maap liya jaataa he
 Keep this device in an open position, so that there is no obstruction in falling in the funnel of rain water
 balvivaah? ek aisi pratha jisase koi aparichit nahin hai
 Kindergarten has been happening not only in India but in the whole world and in the whole world, India is second in kindergarten
 sampoorn bharat main vishwa ke 40% balvivaah hote hai or samooche bharat main 49% ladakiyon kaa vivaah 18 varsh kii aayu se purv hi ho jaataa hai
 In India, child marriage is still prevalent in the state of Kerala, the state with the highest literacy
 unicef kii report ke anusaar, bharat ke gramin kshetron main nagareey kshetron se adhik bal vivaah hote he
 According to statistics, Bihar has the highest incidence of child marriages at 68% while Himachal Pradesh has the lowest child marriages at 9%
 yah soch kar bada ajeeb lagata hai ki vah bharat jo apane aap main ek mahashakti ke rup main ubhar rahaa hai usamen aaj bhi ek aisi kuriti jinda hai
 a kuriti in which two immature people who are completely unknown to each other are forcibly tied together in a bond of living together and those two immature boys may not emerge from the atrocities inflicted on them through this evil life and Later, the situation worsens and results in divorce and death
 to kya yah pratha bharat main adikaal se hi thi? yaa ise baad main prachlan main laayaa gaya? or yadi baad main laayaa gaya to iskaa kya kaaran tha? This practice was not there in India from the beginning
 ye dilli sultanate ke samay main astitv main aayaa jab rajshahi pratha prachlan main thi
 Indian child marriage was used as a weapon to protect girls from rape and abduction by foreign rulers
 bal vivaah ko shuru karne kaa ek or kaaran tha ki bade bujurgon ko apane pauto ko dekhne kii chaah adhik hoti thi isaliye wo kam aayu main hi bacchon kii shaadi kar dete the jisase ki marane se pehle wo apane pautron ke saath kuch samay bitaa saken
 The consequences of kindergarten? balvivaah ke keval dusprinaam hi hote hai jinamen sabase ghaatak shishu va mata kii mrityu dar main vruddhi | shaareerik or maansik vikaas purna nahin ho pataa hai And they are not able to discharge their responsibilities completely and with this, H

 Sexually transmitted diseases are always at risk
 balvivaah hone ke kaaran? There are many reasons for child marriage in India such as- 1
 ladki kii shaadi ko mata-pita dwaara apane upar ek boj samajhnaa | 2
 Lack of education
 3
 roodhiwaadita kaa hona | 4
 Superstition

 nimna aarthik sthiti | Did nothing happen to stop kindergarten? balvivaah ko rokane ke liye itihaas main kai log aage aaye jinamein sabase pramukh rajaraam mohan raay, keshabchandra sen jinhone british sarkaar dwaara ek bill paas karavaaya jise Special Marriage Act kaha jaataa hai iske antargat shaadi ke liye ladko kii umr 18 varsh evam ladakiyon kii umr 14 varsh nirdhaarit kii gayi evam ise pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 However, after the reforms failed, later the bill called Child Marriage Restraint was passed, in which the age of boys was increased to 21 years and the age of girls was increased to 18 years
 swatantra bharat main bhi sarkaar dwaara bhi ise rokane ke kahi praytn kiye gaye or kahi kaanoon banaaye gaye jis se kuch had tak iname sudhaar aayaa parantu ye purna rup se samaapt nahin hua
 Some laws have been enacted by the government such as the Child Marriage Prohibition Act 2006 which are in existence
 ye adhinium bal vivaah ko aanshik rup se simit karne ke sthaan par ise sakhti se pratibandhit karata he
 Under this law, children can declare their child marriage illegal within two years of becoming an adult by their will
 kintu ye kanoon muslimon par lagu nahin hota jo is kanoon kaa sabase badi kami he
 Measures to stop child marriage? balvivaah rokane hetu kuch upaay ho sakate hai jaise- 1
 To spread awareness in the society

 Written By: Amit Sharma pindari athwa pindari himand uttrakhand main kumaun himalay ke nanda devi shikhar ke paas se bahata he
 This glacial melting gives rise to the Pindari River which is a tributary of the Alaknanda
 pindari nadi or alaknanda kaa sangam gadhwal jile main hota he or karnaprayag ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Later, Alaknanda and Bhagirathi form the Ganges
 pindari himand trekking ke liye prasidd he
 The trekking route around it is about 90 kilometers and is completed in six days
 kamala nadi nepal se utpann hokar mukhyatah bharat ke bihar rajya main bahane vaali ek nadi he
 This river is considered to be the most virtuous and important fertile power after the river Ganges in Mithilanchal
 kamala kaa udgam-sthaan nepal ke 'mahabharat parvat' kahalaane vaali shrunkhlaa main he
 Kamala is the Trisrotsa River; That is, basically, three streams come together to form the Kamala River
 pashchim or madhya bhaag ke strot nepal ke sindhuli jile se chalakar dhanukha jile main aate hai
 Among these , the middle source is smaller than the west source, but the third source of the east is longer and this is the source of the actual origin of Kamala
 strot kaa udgam sagarmatha anchal ke udaipur jile ke uttari chor main he or yah udaipur gadhi se nairity kone main behate hue janakapur anchal ke dhanukha jile main aakar teenon strot paraspar milakar dakshin kii ore badhate hai
 First the sources of the west and the central part meet and then the three streams join together and flow about 18 miles eastwards and then flow about 15 miles from the north of Udaipur Garhi to the hilly part of Nepal and then in Dhanukha district of its Terai
 Descends is tarai bhaag main bhi lagbhag 20 mile dakshin kii ore bahane ke baad bharat ke bihar rajya main jayanagar naamak prasiddh sthaan ke paas kamala bihar ke vartmaan madhubani jile main avatarit hoti he, jahaan use atyadhik pavitra nadi ke rup main manyata praapt ho jaati he
 From the point of view of virtue, Kamala has the paramount position after Ganga in Mithila
 shrivrihadvishnupurana ke chaturdash adhyay main 'mithila-mahatmaya' ke antargat mithila kii mahatvapurn nadiyon kaa naam ginane ke kram main sarvapratham 'kosi' ke baad 'kamala' kaa hi naam liya gaya he
 Although Kosi is the largest river among the rivers of Mithilanchal, its fame has remained as Mahavinashni river
 iske vipareet kamala shasyahasta vishnupriya lakshmi ke rup main prasiddh rahi he
 People worship it by calling it 'kamala Maiya'
 ek manyata kosi ko mahakali, kamala ko mahalakshmi tathaa baagmati ko mahasaraswati ke rup main maanane kii bhi rahi he
 Where the water of Kosi flows from there the land becomes barren; Whereas the water of Kamala passes from where it is in the flood, leaving such a blanket that the yield of crops increases manifold
 isliye baadh main vikaraal rup dhaaran karne ke baavjood tathaa kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaane ke baavjood kamala kii mahima kamala maiyaa ke rup main bani hui he
 Kamala's three very ancient streams flowed from the Jibach River, a famous river of Mithilanchal, whose name now remains as 'jeevacha River'
 kamala kii ye pracheen dharaayen jayanagar-madhubani rail maarg se pashchim hokar bahati thim, jabaki baad kii dharaayen jayanagar-madhubani rail maarg se purab hokar bahati rahi hai
 These streams are virtually famous as 'kamala River'
 vartmaan main kamala mithilanchal kii apekshaakrit choti nadi 'balaan' se milakar bahati he or praayah 'kamala-balaan' ke naam se jaani jaati he
 This Balan is different from 'bhutahibalan', a large river of Mithilanchal
 kamala naam se prasiddh dhara kaa bhi pracheen maarg ab suukh chukaa he tathaa itihaas ban chukaa he
 The ancient stream of Kamala also passed through the huge cross of the eastern part of Jayanagar, flowing southwards, often adjacent to the rail route of the eastern part near Jayanagar
 kamala kii is dhara ke kinare brahmottar, selera, sukkhi, bhakua, maniyarava tathaa khajauli gaanv padate the
 Near Sukhi, a very small river of Mithilanchal met the 'dhauri' Kamla
 kamala kii yah pracheen dhara khajauli railway stesan or khajauli gaanv se ke bich se bahati thi
 To the right of this stream was the railway station to the west and Khajuli village to the east
 us samay gaanv se stesan kii duuri lagbhag dhai mile thi
 Kamla used to turn towards Agnogna by going to a village called Lalpur, about two and three-three miles south of Khajuli
 madhubani se 7 mile dur purab-uttar kone main sthit mirzapur naamak gaanv ke paas kamala kii ek or dhara pariharpur kii ore se aakar milti thi tathaa iske baad kamala agni kone main bahati hui koilakh gaanv se pashchim raghuveer chak gaanv ke paas se bahati hui rampattee, khanagaanv or navahath gaanv tak pahunchati thi
 Two streams of Kamala used to be built near the village of Navahath, out of which the eastern stream has completely ended
 yah dhara lohat mil ke paas se tathaa 'bhore' gaanv hote hue agnikon main rampur tathaa madhopur gaanv tak pahunchati thi
 This ancient stream from Madhopur turned south and went south from east of Sarisavpahi after crossing the darbhanga-jhanjharpur railway line
 jhanjharpur se 3 mile pashchim main sukhware gaanv ke paas yah rail line paar karti thi
 To the south of this railway line and to the right of this dead stream of Kamla is a village called Bisoul in the west
 yah bisaul gaanv harlakhi ke paas vaale bisaul se bhinn he
 From here this ancient stream flowed mostly in the Agnok towards the south direction and passed through Lagma village to Madariya village and ended in the ancient Chaur situated in the northeastern part of Bahera
 chaur main jahaan yah dhara apana jalashay banaati thi vah sthaan baheda se lagbhag 5 yaa 6 mile purv-uttar disha main he
 The second stream of Kamla near the village of Nawhath turned west and reached the Agni angle of Semuar village and crossed the sakri-madhubani railway line and proceeded to the south of the adjoining south of its western side, dahibhat-narottam village
 yah gaanv isaki bain ore tathaa rail line ke purab sthit he
 After crossing the railway line at Sakri, flowing southwards, this stream of Kamala used to reach the villages named Raghopur, Nehra, Maujampur and Sirirampur
 baheda se purab navada gaanv bhi is dhara ke baayein kinare basaa he or magaura gaanv daayen kinare
 From this Majoura village, this stream of Kamla used to run in Agni kon and reach near Harsinghpur via sripur-jagat village and flowed in the south direction to Vishunpur village and reached west of Dumri and Birol
 birul bazaar kamala kii is dhara ke baayein kinare avasthit he
 Flowing south from here, Kamala entered the Singhia police station in Samastipur district and diverted her stream to Agni angle and reached Missi village
 missi gaanv se dakshin mahari naamak gaanv ke paas yah tarasarai hokar aane vaali apni pracheen shakha jeevach kii poorabi dhara ko grahan kar leti thi
 Then, flowing through the fire angle, Mohim Khurd and Bisaria village used to become Uttara Vahini near Pipra village
 phir kuch dur baad purv disha kii ore bahati hui dakshin disha main ghumkar darbhanga-saharsa jile kii seemaa banati hui dakshin disha main bahati hui itahar, simratoke, mahadev math aadi gaanv ke paas pahunchati thi
 Earlier, this stream of Kamala in the northeast angle of Tilakpur was confluent with the Kareh, the branch of Bagmati; But now there is confluence with Kosi
 ukt itahar gaanv ke pashchim main hi kusheshwar naamak prasiddh shivasthaan he
 Until 1954 AD, the caterpillar flowed only through the overgrown streams
 ve dharaayen ab isaki chhaadan nadi ban gayi hai
 In 1954 AD, Kamla, leaving her private Dharamarg, suddenly began to assimilate the flow of a small river of Mithilanchal, another river called 'balan', flowing quite west from Soni and Bhutahi Balan
 vartmaan main kamala kii dhara jayanagar ke paas se dakshin kii ore bahakar aati hui khajauli thane main pravesh karti he or bhatchaura ke dakshin tathaa bhakua ke purv-dakshin kone main tathaa chatra-gobarora ke purvottar kone main soni nadi ke pravaah maarg ko apana leti he
 The Soni river flowed through the Terai region of Nepal in the east and flowed east of the village of Kumarkhat in Madhubani district and west of Kamatoulia and used to join the embankment of Kamala near Chharohi and Baruar villages
 ab iskaa namonishaan mit chukaa he
 From the said place, Kamla flowing from the Dharamarg of Soni, meets the Balan river at the famous place called 'pipraghat' west of Babuarhi and is flowing in the current by making its own Dharamarg, ending the existence of Balan next to it
 piparaghat ke aage vartmaan main jo kamala kaa dharamarg he vah vastutah pehle ukt balaan nadi kaa hi dharamarg tha
 After the assimilation of Balan, this modern stream of Kamla reaches near the villages Bhatgama, Bithouni, Chapahi, Gangadwar and Imadpatti
 imadpattee ke dakshin main madhubani se sangram naamak gaanv tak jane vaala pracheen maarg kamala ko paar karata he
 This ghat was formerly the ghat of the Balan river, but now it is called the ghat of the Kamala river
 yahi ghat kandarpi ghat naam se prasiddh he
 Flowing south from near Kandarpi Ghat, Kamla reaches the village of Mehrail and then reaches Jhanjharpur via Mahinathpur
 jhanjharpur main kamala nadi ke upar se railway pul he
 After this, this modern stream of Kamla flows from near the village named Rataul and Gangapur, coming west of 'raja Kharwar' and turning in the southeast corner, reaching the famous village Bhith Bhagwanpur, flowing from the villages of Jadupatti, Padri, Dohatha etc
 bheeth bhagavanpur kamala se purab main sthit he
 To the east of Dohatha village, the Balan River used to meet the Tilayuga, but those rivers have now ended and the Kamala, which assimilates Balan, now meets the Kosi river
 is prakaar kamala kaa muhaana ab kosi nadi se milakar banataa he

 Ignorance of the ancient history and geography of the Indian Aryans, either due to our laziness or being destroyed by the enemies of our valuable historical books, does not yet give us the opportunity to proclaim with full certainty what our ancient Aryan culture is
 The category had reached that time, when the emergence of modern neo-civilized nations, who would say, there was no name or mark! Of course, the assistance of European scholars in pursuing our ancient history is valuable
 videshi hokar bhi aaj tak un logon ne jo kuch kiya, vah aashaatheet or hamaari ankhen kholane ke liye paryaapt he
 Our history is not limited to a few Christians or deformed words; This is not out of the sight of the monitoring apparatus of the mind of the universe-modern and modern scholars

 This dispute, which is unbearable to any Indian scholar, has been going on for many days
 pracheen itihaas ke anushilan ke liye praayah do paripati chal padi hai or aitihaasik tattvon kaa spashtikaran bhi praayah do zude-zude margon se ho rahaa he
 Western scholars must have been very hesitant and malicious in scheduling

 haan, to hamaara itihaas aaj ek prakaar se pramaanon ke abhaav main Mythology sa ban gaya he
 The Purana has become gossip-like and the Ramayana and Mahabharata have got the metaphorical form! It is a matter of helplessness and shame for us
 bhartiya vidvan isi gutthi ke sulajhane kaa praytn kar rahe hai
 Vidvdar Shriyut K
 P
 Jaiswal, in the Journal of Bihar and orisa-research-society, has clearly proved on the basis of a chapter in the garg-samhita that Indians knew how to write history, and from the historical chapter of Garg we know History can be reached smoothly
 bahut nikat-bhavishya main mahabharat se aaj tak kaa susambaddh itihaas hamaare saamne aa jaayga, aisi aashaa kii jaati he
 The historical account of the garg-samhita is found in the historical account of the Greek scholars who wrote about India
 jaiswalji kaa yah praytn aitihaasik sansar main ugantar paidaa kar saktaa he
 Only by following the immense Sanskrit literature can we be successful in exploring our history
 lokmaanya tilak hamaare path-pradarshak ho gayi hai; ab hamen aage badhanaa he
 In this article, we have to try to give a glimpse of the ancient history of India on a geographical basis
 is sambandh main upanishad, puraana or mahabharat ke bhugolic varnanon se hamen bahut kuch pataa lag saktaa he
 In the Srimad Bhagwat, only the complete layout of geography has been drawn
 is lekh main main keval bhugolic aadhaar par yah siddh karne kii koshish karunga ki arya log bharatvarsh main kabul kii ore se na aakar kashmir kii raah se aaye or sindhu-nadi ke kinare-kinare aakar saare punjab main bas gayi
 Moving from Punjab to the northwest, they reached the vicinity of the Kabul River and there they encountered that branch of the Aryans, which was the northwestern region of the oxus-river Airya nem Vaejo i
e
 'aryan Vrajah'
 Disappeared from the branch
 unka bhartiya aaryon se mataiky nahin tha, tathaa ve bhartiya aaryon ko dev-poojak kehane lage the
 Indian Aryans used to call him as 'asura'
 rugveda main ’asur’ shabd kaa arth vahi nahin he, jo aaj samajha jaataa he
 Previously, the word 'asura' was used in the meaning of 'asun Rati Lati Dadati Iti Asurah'
 ab iskaa arth ho gaya he-’na surah asurah’
 It is difficult to tell the main reason for the battle of the Indian Aryans with the Iranian Aryans, but it can be said that the reason for this malice was some economic and some religious
 ham rugveda main dekhte hai ki aaryon ke devon kii sankhya kramshah badhati jaati he
 There is no indication of the Brahmin part of Vedic literature in the Avesta
 haan, rugveda kii bhanti jinda-avesta main mantra or sutara avashya vidyaman hai
 The form of a mantra is 'manthra'
 parsiyon ke pavitra granthon kaa naam ’manthr-swent’ he
 Among the gods of the Avesta — which resemble the Indian Aryans — are Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, and Yami
 vaidic sahitya main idhar aaryon ne din-din vikaas praapt kiya
 The thought stream flowed in perpetuity
 bhartiya arya tathaa parsiyon kii bhugolic sthiti or aalochana-ab bhartiya tathaa parsiyon kii bhugolic sthiti par samyak vichaar karke main yah spasht karunga ki kis tarah bhartiya sahitya main varnit bhugol kii paripati avesta ke bhugol se bhinn he
 First let me briefly list the countries of Jambudweep mentioned in the Vayu-purana- edam haimavatan varshan bhaaratan naam vishrutam
 Hemkut paan tasmat namna kimpurushan smritam Naishadham Hemkutattu Harivarsham Taduchyate
 harivarshaat paranchaiv merosch tadilavritam
ilaavritat paran neelan ramyakan naam vishrutam
 रम्यात् परं श्वेत विश्रुतं तत् हिरण्मयम्॥ हिरण्मयात् परं चापि शृंगवांस्तु कुरुः स्मृतम्। haimavat varsh arthath prasiddh bharatvarsh, Then there is Hemkut mountain, which is called Kimpurush country, hemkut ke baad naishadh he, jise harivarsh kehete hai, After Harivarsha is north of meru-parvat, ilaavruth ke baad nil varsh he, jo ’ramyak’ namase prasiddh he, To the north of Ramayak is the white-country, which is called Hiranmay and hiranmay ke baad shrungavan he, jo kuru naam se prakhyat he
 Thus, according to Vayu Purana under Jambudweep there were seven countries
 saaton deshon main sabase uttar kuru desh hua
 Where is this 'kuru', it becomes clear from the following verse of the universe- uttarasy samudrasya samudrante c dakshine
 Kuravah tatra tadvarsham punya siddha-nurtavitam yah kuru uttareey samudr ke dakshin kii ore basaa hua he
 Siddha men live here, whose name is 'kuru'
 avashya hi yah kuru uttarsagar ke dakshin rahaa hoga, jo uttar dhruv ke uttareey vrutt main basaa hoga
 Take from it Tilak's opinion does not hurt
 parantu prashn yah hota he ki is kuru or bharat-khand ke kuru main kya sambandh he ? iskaa samaadhaan main peeche karunga
 Till then it should be seen how this Kuru is described in our Puranas
 padmapurana ke nimnlikhit shloke anaavashyak nahin kahe ja sakate- Uttaren tu sringasya samudrante dvijottama :
 varshmairawatan naam tasmaat shrungwatah param
na tu tatra suryagatih na jiryyanti c maanvaah
 Chandramashta Sanakshatro Jyotirbhut Iavvrata: that is, at the end of the north sea of shringa is the Airavat year, where 'the best among the Dwijs' live
 yah varsh shrungavan ke baad he tathaa yahan par na to surya kii gati he, na manushya jeern hote hai or sa-nakshatra chandramaa shaashvat chamakate rahete hai
 Here Uttar Pradesh has become Airavat instead of Kuru
 kintu padmapurana ke anusaar uttar kuru ko is meru or nil ke madhya main pate hai
 like- dakshinen tu nilasy meroh parshwe tathottare
 उत्तरः कुरवो विप्राः पुण्याः सिद्धनिषेविताः॥ is shloke main ham brahmandpurana kii chaaya to avashya pate hai, parantu kuru yahan uttar-kuru hokar, uttar-dhruv ke nikatavartti pradeshon se hatakar, meru or nil ke madhya main aa gaya he
 It is certainly an indicator of the transfer of Aryans
 arya log madhya-ashia kii ore badhate aate hai or apane priy pradesh kaa naam apane saath lete aate hai, jo madhya-ashia se dakshin kii ore hatate-hatate, bharat-khand main kuru-paanchal ke rup main parivartit ho gaya he
 i will show it in the epilogue
 tab tak main anya pramaan dwaara yah siddh karunga ki yahi kuru mahabharat main harivarsh main kis prakaar aa gaya he
 In the context of Arjuna's victory-journey in the meeting-festival of Mahabharata, the mention of north-kuru is also mentioned
 isamen uttar-kuru logon kaa harivarsh main rahanaa siddh hota he
 This green year is no longer under the nearest circle of the North Pole
 yah bahut hi dakshin kii ore hatakar maansarovar ke pradeshon ke uttar main batalaaya jaataa he
 The victory sequence of Arjuna is as follows - He first shwet parvat ko paar kar kimpurushon ke rahane kii jagah par arthath kimpurush-varsh main jate hai, jo drumaraaja ke putr dwaara rakshit he
 After that, after conquering them and taking them away, they went to a country named 'hatak' protected by the guhyakas
 unhen bhi jitkar vah maansarovar kii ore aage bad gayi
 On the other hand, after the Hatak country, near the Mansarovar was the land of Gandharvas
 is desh ko bhi jitkar gandharvon se titir-kilmish or mandu-naamak ghode kar-swaroop unhone grahan kiye
 On going north from this, he got Harivarsha
 yahan mahakay, mahaviry dwarapalon ne inaki gati anunay-vinay karke roak di
 They said that there is no movement of humans here, people of north-kuru live here; There is nothing worth winning here
 yahan pravesh karne par bhi, he parth, tumhen kuch bhi nazar nahin aayegaa or na manushya tan se yahan kuch darshneey hi he
 Those people again investigated Parth's wish
 parth ne kaha ki main keval dharmraj yudhisthir ke parthivtv kaa sweekaar chahta hoon
 That is why there is a need for tax for Yudhishthira
 yah sunakar un logon ne divya-divya vastra, kshomajin tathaa divya aaabharan diye

 Haridwar or Kailash, but north of it, we consider Alakapuri, the city of Gandharva, as a fantasy

 Arjuna crossed the White Mountains, the Himalayas and proceeded northward; But we are not ready to accept anything more than the poet's imagination

 But before that we would like to show how Buddhist people are related to the northern regions of the Himalayas

 ne apane trans-himalayan-reminiscences in Pali-literature naamak nibandh main yah bahut hi acchhee tarah se dikhalaayaa he ki baudhon kaa prabhaav himalayottar-pradesh main hi itnaa adhik kyon padaa tathaa buddha log maansarovar ke nikatavarti pradeshon ke hi itane premi kyon huye
 He has proved on the basis of Buddhist natives that the love of Indian Aryans was somewhat natural from the Himalayan region
 ham unke nikaale huye nishkarsh ko asweekaar nahin kar sakate
 The history of the post-mahabharata has been described by Gargacharya in his garga-samhita
 upar likhaa ja chukaa he ki shriyut ke
 pi
 jaiswal ne Behar & Orissa Research Society ke Journal main, gargasamhita ke ‘yug-puraana’ naamak adhyay ke aadhaar par, kis prakaar janamejay se lekar khrishtabd se do shatabdi purv tak ke itihaas kaa digdarshan karaayaa he
 Gargacharya has written Indian history since Krishna's death
 unke itihaas kii paripushti pracheen mudraon, videshi vidwaanon ke record tathaa swatantra pramaanon se bhi hoti he
 He mentions the disharmony between Janamejaya and Brahmins
 duusari baat, jo garg-samhita se vidit hoti he, yah he ki mahabharat ke baad dhire-dhire brahman dharm kaa kendra takshashila se hatakar magadh ke patliputra main aa gaya
 The capital of Janamejaya is Taxila and has enmity with the Brahmins
 mahabharat ke baad avashya hi brahman dharm yani vaidic dharm ke viruddh aandolan uthne kaa sanket paaya jaataa he
 Why this happened, only history can be told at that time
 hindu pranali ke anusaar mahabharat kaa samay khrishtabd se 3,000 varsh ke lagbhag pehle mana jaataa he or yah samay paakar satya bhi sabit ho saktaa he
 We know that Buddhadev and mahavira-jain arose in the middle of seventh century before Christ
 swabhaavatah is dharmik kranti ke safal hone main 2,400 varsh kaa samay bahut nahin he
 Changes have been taking place in our religious thoughts since the Vedic period and we also get to know the gradual development of Hindu philosophy
 tab vaidic kaal ke anekeshwarwad se upanishtkaal ke akeshwarwad tak ham aa jate hai
 After monotheism we get Brahmanism, from which Vedanta originated
 is brahmavaad main mayawad sammilit he
 The world is considered to be Maya's web and Brahma is the truth
 parantu isi brahmavaad or mayawad kii dhooma ke baad purush or prakruti-vaad kaa aandolan jaagrath ho jaataa he
 Brahman becomes Purush and Maya Prakriti
 is vichaar vikaas main paryaapt samay laga hoga
 In the sutra period, we get the numerology of Kapil
 yadhyapi sankhyakarika sankhyadharm ke udai ke bahut dinon ke baad ek vishisht darshan ke rupamen prakat hui, tathaapi ham ise kam-se-kam buddha dharm se 5-6 sau varsh purv samay dene main koi aapatti nahin samajhate
 mcdonald, too, at least accepts the rise of Sankhadharma from Christ 1,000 years ago
 sankhya ke aadhibhautik dharm ko ham baudhon yaa jainon ke dharm kaa mul -kaaran samajhate hai
 Kapil was considered an atheist because of his thoughts
 dhire-dhire 400 varshon tak naastikta kaa, jaisaa ki us samay samajha gaya, vikaas hota gaya
 Charvak etc
 also emerged in these four hundred years
 atharv-kaal ke baad hamen tantra-dharm kaa bhi sutarapaat hote dekh padataa he
 Gradually this systemicism gained momentum and the form of Vedic religion became distorted
 yahi tantravaad sambhavtah shakt-dharm kaa mul-kaaran rahaa
 By the time of Gautama Buddha, violence would have been fully propagated in the general public
 parakshit ke putr janamejay ke samay se hi brahmanon ke viruddh durbhaav failane lage or yahi kaaran he ki takshashila chhodkar brahmandharmavalambi arya magadh kii ore aa gayi
 Being a follower of Gargha Brahmanadharma, the Acharya of the garg-samhita, must surely appear to the hawk by making Buddhist or its previous history a reflection
 sach puuchhiye, to sanskrit sahitya hi is vishay main bilkul chup he
 It must have been a time of mutual rebellion and unrest
 garg ke saamne avashya hi aitihaasik granth maujuud rahe honge; parantu un granthon main naastikon kii katha na likhi gayi ho, yah sambhav prathit hota he
 As a result, without the practice of Buddhist literature, one cannot get a complete address of Indian history
 phir bhi ham prasanganusaar buddha jaatakon main aaye hue himalayottar-pradeshon kaa varnan karenge
 Although these appear to be fiction, we get to know the true existence of Uttar Kuru
 ’milindapanh’ main ’sagal’ nagar kii uttar-kuru se tulana kii he, jaise-’uttarkuru sankasm sampann sasyan’
 We also find the Jambudweep in the north-south of Kuru, in the Jadak Pandit's Jataka
 samaran rakhana chaiye ki yahan par jambudweep khaas bharat samajha gaya
 Just like Purato Videhe Pas Goyanie Cha Pachto Karuyo
 jambudipanch pass manimhi pass nimittan
iske anantar phir bhi ham nimna-likhit vaakya miltaa he-videheti puvvvidehan goyaniryati apargoyanideepan; kuryo ti uttarkuru c dakshinto jambudipanch
 That is, Videha is called east-videha, Goyanirya is the island of Upper Goyani, Kuru is north-kuru and its south is Jambudweep
 isse uttar-kuru kaa himalay se uttar hona siddh hua
 The Basindas of this north-kuru are also considered better than the Basindas of Jambudweep
 jaise-tihi bhiknve thaanehi uttarkuruka manussa deve c tavatinse adhiganhanti jambudipake c manusse
 Katmati tiii? Amna Ch, Aparigagaha, Niyatayuka, Visesbhujo
 arthath teenon baton main uttar-kuru ke manushya or tavatins ke dev jambudweep ke manushyon se bhinn hai
 Which are those three? They are ruthless, that is, heartless, do not take shelter, are immortal and are about to eat some special food
 shriyut devendranath sen ne ’palisutt’ ke aadhaar par anotattamahasar kaa maansarovar hona sabit kiya he
 a description of the seven rivers is found in the pali-sutras; Such as Anattatta, Simhapat, Rathkar, Kannamund, Kunal, Chhandant and Mandakini
 himalay se nikali nadiyaan ganga, yamuna, achiravati, sarabhu or mahi he
 'sarbhu' is probably the Sadanira of Saryu and Achiravati Vedic times
 mahi uttar bihar kii ek prasiddh nadi he
 Anottatta means anvapat
 sutron ke anusaar yah jhil uttar-kuru main he; kyonki uttarkuru main bodhisattva or buddha bhikshu log bhikshatan kar, anotatt dah main vishram karte the
 The Uttar Kurus who play a mythical part in the epic and later literature, are still a historical people in the ऐतरेय ब्राह्मण where they are located beyond the Himalayas 
 In another passage, however, the country of the Uttar Kurus is stated by Vashishtha Satyahavya to be a land of Gods, but जानन्तापि अत्याराति was anxious to conquer it, so that it is still not wholly mythical
-keith
 The territory of the Kuru Panchal is declared in the aitarey brahman to be the middle country 
 a group of the Kuru people still remained further north-the Uttar Kurus beyond the Hiamlayas
 It appears from a passage of the shatapath brahman that the speech of the Norherners-that is presumably the Norhern Kurus-and of the Kuru Panchal was similar and regarded as specially pure
 There seems little doubt that the Brahmanical culture was developed in the country of the kurupanchal and that it spread then east, south and west-macdonald
 It is clear that north-kuru is to the north of the Himalayas and it has been a historical region in the time of Aitareya Brahmin, from where and had direct relation to Kurupanchal
 sambhavtah kurupanchal-nivasee uttar-kuru ke hi vanshdhar or shakha hai
 The geographical development of this north-kuru is the most amazing and important thing for our history
 isse aaryon kaa kramshah uttareey dhruv ke pradeshon se aate-aate sindhu-nadi ke tatavartti pradesh kii raah se bharatvarsh arthath jambudweep main aana siddh hota he
 There can be many routes for Aryans to come from the foothills of the Himalayas
 yah kashmir se tibet tak visteern he
 The indication of this endangered path is well received from the sources of the Rigveda
 irani arya kahan se bhartiya aaryon se vilag huye, yah aage batalaaya jaayga
 Our literature is filled with the saintly memories of the Himalayan region
 kabhi kisi kaa dhyaan kabul kii ore nahin gaya
 Why? We will show this in the epilogue section
 swarg ke astitv kii dharna hamaare man se abhi tak nahin gayi he
 It would be our great mistake if we do not openly accept this direct historical fact
 duusari baat jise bhuulane kii samarthy nahin, yah he ki buddha dharm kaa prachaar himalay se uttar hi vyapak rup main hua
 The root cause of this natural propaganda can also be natural
 chini yatri fahyaan or huensang ke varnan iske liye paryaapt hai
 Fahian received a thorough promotion of Buddhism in places like Khotan, before entering India
 hinayan-panth ke hazaron bhikshu uttar kii ore gayi
 The propagation of Mahayana-sect was found in Hinayana and Khotan in Shenchen
 sarvatra sanskrit or paali kaa bolbalaa tha
 Huanseang, who came from the Gobi Desert, found a similar script to the Indian script in the surrounding areas of Gobi
 buddhadev kii murti, sangharam tathaa anek mandir bhi mili
 He came through Akshu to the valley of the Oxus and left Balkh from there
 yah balkh apane mandiron kii bahulata ke kaaran rajgrih kaha jaataa tha
 Not surprisingly, if Sir Aralsten found buried texts of Sanskrit and Prakrit within Khotan's sand
 udhrake shaharon ke naam tak sanskrit or prakritmay hai
 According to Principal Sen, this is an unmistakable proof of the interconnectedness of Turkestan before India
 yah sansarg vaidic sabhyataa se bhi purv kaa hoga
 Now, for our goal, we draw the attention of the readers towards the Aryans, who broke away from the Indian branch and went to Iran
 ham upar kah chuke hai ki bhartiya arya us smoranathit samay main alag hue, jab unke vaidic devataaon kii sankhya bahut badhane nahin paayi thi
 The explanation of where 'aryan Vrajah' is - will be the history of the last union of these two branches
 ve avashya hi us samay vilag hue, jab ve ’aryaanaa vrajah’ main rahete the
 Sen has told it to be somewhere in the northwest of the river Oxus
 atev yah caspian yaa kashyap sagar ke dakshin-purvavartti praant main kahin ho saktaa he
 This will be clear from the geographical description of Zendavesta
 kintu bhugolic varnan ke purv yah nishchay kar lenaa uchit he ki aaryon ke is paraspar vaimnasy kaa kaaran kya ho saktaa he
 The story of the origins of the demons and the Adityas is well known to the two wives of Kashyapa Rishi
 bahut sambhav he, kashyap-sagar ke aasapaas hi kashyap rishi kaa rahanaa hua ho
 In the legend of the demon and Aditya, there is an idea of devasur-struggle
 parsiyon ke ishtdev zoroster ko zendavesta main ’manthran’ kaha gaya he
 The ancient presiding deities of the Aryans are exactly the same as the Parsis and the Indian Aryans
 zoroster ne aaryon se matbhed hote hi dev-poojak aaryon ke viruddh baghaavat shuru kar di
 In the ancient Suktas of the Rig Veda, this distinction has become very strong due to the absence of the difference between sur and asura
 asuron ke viruddh devdal or devdal ke viruddh asuradal peeche prakat ho gayi hai
 Surprisingly, just as the meaning of Dev has become a demon in Persia, Iran, similarly in India, the meaning of Asura is considered a demon! The same discrimination is found in Muslims' interpretation of the word "hindu", which means something else
 kam-se-kam itnaa to nishchit he ki bhartiya tathaa parsi arya kisi badi baat ko lekar hi ek duusare se zuda hue
 Religious development took place mostly by Indian Aryans
 isse yah nishkarsh nikaala ja saktaa he ki bhartiya shakha kaa jhukaav is ore adhik tha tathaa unki vichaardhaara din-din aage kii ore badhati gayi
 Whether these two parties were separated from the adjacent provinces of the river Oxus or from some other place, but they separated after a terrible disharmony! This is further confirmed when we see that the paths of the two branches have become two
 irani shakha ko sahaj maarg mila or bhartiya shakha ko pahari pradeshon kii sharan leni padi
 From each line of the Rig Veda, a humbling humble prayer appears, to remove the inaccessibility of the path
 bharat main aa jane par aaryon ko aisi kathinaayee nahin thi ki unhen pag-pag par atyaachaari shatruon ke naash ke liye ishtdevon kii duhai deni padati
 They would have had to take this route only after giving up from the tortured-other branch
 yah nishchit karne ke purv ki arya log uttar kii ore se dakshin kii ore himalay ke maarg se aaye or aryavartt ke kurukshetra tak failte-failte apane pracheen uttar-kuru kii smriti main kurukshetra kaa udghaatan jambudweep main kiya, yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki irani shakha kis maarg se yahan aakar basii or kaalaantar main uski sthiti or manovriti kisi rahi
 Ahur Mazd, who was the hero of the Zoroaster-sect of the Iranian branch, settled 16 territories, in which the following territories have been matched with the modern territories - upar kii talika se spasht he ki irani shakha bhartiya shakha se alag ho pehle pahal ’aryaanaa vrajah’ main hi rahi
 It means the land of Aryans
 is namakaran se yah spasht he ki ve bhi arya-shabd kii smriti main apane vasasthaan kaa naam rakhana pasand karte the
 It is said to be inhabited by Vrajhi Daliya
 yah nadi oxs-nadi ke kahin uttar-pashchim kii ore thi
 After this, they proceeded towards Samarkand, Merv, Balkh, Herat, Kabul and Saptasindhu respectively Punjab
 is bhugolic varnan main ek baat, jis par hamen vichaar karnaa he, yah he ki jis prakaar hamaare sahitya main meru yaa uttar-kuru se armbh kar kimpurushavarsh aadi hote huye himavant or jambudweep kaa kramik sambaddh varnan he, usee prakaar or thik usee prakaar iraniyon kii gati kaa silsilaa bhi paaya jaataa he
 a glance at any sudhi makes it clear that the two branches have two different paths; There are two geographical communities; There are different gods of separation between the two
 One more thing; 'aryanan Vrajah', is the nearest state to the Celestial Mountain - also named Thianshan
 donon shakhaon ke vidroh par drudh vishwaas tab or bhi ho jaataa he, jab ham yah dekhte hai ki indra, jo bhartiya shakha ke aradhy dev hai, parsiyon ke liye ek durdant daitya hai
 The Rigveda's hymns testify to this
 indra, jinke arya log bade kritagya hai, barbar apni veerta kii prashansa sunate hai
 He has helped the Aryans by destroying the team of Asuras
 dev or asuron kii ladaai main vah sadaa agrasar rahete hai
 Indra lived on these heavenly mountains
 sumeru-parvat kaa nirdesh hamen Thianshan yaa Celestial yaa swargeey parvaton main mil jaataa he
 Of course, this fierce battle of Tire and Asuras must have happened in the eastern border of Iran
 Vendidad ke varnananusaar marv paapapurna or nasht-bhrasht ho gaya tha
 Similarly, Nishay, who was under Merv and Balkh, was a perpetrator of sin and atheism, Herat was obsessed with Ashrupat and Vikal anguish; And paganism was increasing in Vaekereta or Kabul, and Kirisasp became a priest
 ye donon shakhayein kab or kahan alag huin, iskaa thik-thik andaaza karnaa kathin he; parantu itnaa anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki oxs ke dakshin or thiyaanshaan yaa meru-parvat-maala ke nikatavarti pradeshon main kahin inke do dal hue
 Indra seems to be the head of the Indian branch
 ahurmajd ke netritv main doosraa dal rahaa hoga
 To consider each other as heretical and to make the other's presiding deity a monster is the culmination of religious intolerance
 astu, zenda avesta ’aryaanaa vrajah’ se marv, balkh, iran, kabul or saptsindhu kaa nirdesh detaa he
 From this one can conclude that the Iranian branch, ie the Parsis, separated from the Aryans, spread from the path of Kabul to Saptasindhu while deciding the highland of Iran
 bhartiya shakha bhi kabul kii raah se aayi, yah atyant hi sandehaaspad siddhanth he
 When we see that Zendavesta draws his map of geography in this way and starts his statement from Kabul and moves towards east, then we can reach only two conclusions - one is that from the Saptasindhu of Aryan people Only two teams were formed and the Iranian branch moved from Saptasindhu towards the north-west region
 or, duusare yah ki bhartiya shakha uttar kii ore se sidhe sindhu-nadi kii raah se aayi tathaa saptsindhu main falkar purv kii ore badhane lagi
 In the meantime, while the Pamir spread to Kabul via Karakoram and the Indus route, the Iranian branch also expanded to Kabul via the previously designated route
 sambhavtah yahan phir unki iraniyon se muthbhed ho gayi
 The aim of both branches was towards Saptasindhu, this may be a matter of doubt; But if we consider more carefully, it becomes clear that there was no other area for expansion of both the parties
 thiyaanshaan ke purv thodi hi dur par gobi kii marubhumi dikh padati he
 What was the shape of this desert at that time, it cannot be said exactly; But either it was the sea or as some of the philosophers say, or it was the sum of the rocky rocks
 bhootattvavettaon kaa kathan he ki siberia jis avasthaa main aaj he, usee avasthaa main kabhi madhya-asia kaa yah bhaag rahaa hoga
 In Siberia, signs of ancient carpet forest are found and it is estimated that at one time it was weathered so that humans could live here
 taatpary yah ki bhartiya shakha ko sivaa maansarovar se jaakar tibet tak failane ke doosraa koi chaara nahin tha
 Probably he did not come once in India, but from time to time he kept coming at his convenience
 rugveda ke sookhton main iran kii adhityaka yaa kabul ke pashchimi pradeshon kaa abhasana milakar himalayottar-pradesh kii smriti kaa abhas miltaa he-rugveda ke adhyayan se is baat kaa pataa chal jaayga ki jin prakritik drishyon ko dekhakar arya-rishi mantramugdh ho apni saral parimarjeet kavita kii anjali samarpit karte the, ve prakritik drishy himavant ke is paar yaa us paar hi sulabh hai
 In those eulogistic poems, he draws a view of nature and praises his Mars and splendor
 lokmaanya jin sookt yaa richaon ke aadhaar par aaryon ko himalayottar-pradeshon ke aadi-nivasee bataate hai, ve sookt unki smriti ke jite jaagate chitra hai

 Cannot successfully refute the principles of Tilak
 chaahe arya pehle-pahal uttar dhruv ke nikatavarti vrutt ke nivasee rahe hon chaahe or idhar aakar siberia ke maidan main based hon, yah sweekaar karnaa hi padegaa ki ve aaye usee disha se or ant tak, aryaavart main bas jane tak, apni punya-smriti ko tazaa rakhte gayi
 Answer- It is clear from the geographical directions of Kuru that the Aryans loved the word 'kuru' till the end
 aaryon kaa yah aitihaasik or bhugolic silsilaa thik utana hi satya he, jitna unka prakritik drishyon kaa manan kar darshan or jyotish-shaastra kaa vikaas karnaa
 Regardless of when the Sukta of the Rig Veda was composed, it can be said that which Sukta is referring to which subject
 ham neeche un sookhton ko dete hai, jinaki vyakhya tilak ke baad sabhi vaidic vidvan karne lage hai-ami ya riksha nihitas uccha naktan dadrushe kuhachit deeveyuh ? ad vadhani varunasya vratani vichaakshat chandramaa naktameti
 That is, those Rakshas, who are situated in the high sky-circle, are seen at night
 ve din main kahan chale jate hai ? varun ke kaamon ko koi asweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 By his command, the moon gives moonlight at night
 yah richa us samay bani hogi, jab arya log uttar-dhruv ke pradeshon se hatakar bahut idhar aa gayi honge
 Sir Tilak has shown on the strength of the Richa that the same star was illuminated in the place where he lived, where the day was short and the night was very big
 yah uttareey pradeshon kaa chitra he
 The above mentioned Richa was created only where it must have been happening day and night and the moon would also rise
 pavepayanti parvatan wivinchanti vanaspatin
 Prof Arat Maruto Dermada and Devas: All the while shaking the mountains, dropping trees, o Maruto! You walk like a madam devta in a smooth way
 daspatnirahigopa atishthat niruddha aapupaninev gaavah
 His late interests, such as the Vrittran Jaghnwa, were then stopped by the water vratra like the hidden cows, which are their husbands and masters
 indra ne vrutra kaa vadh kiya or maarg svachh kar diya, jisase pani bah gaya, jo vrutra dwaara roak diya gaya tha
 The above description has seen the eyes of the sages
 vrutra kaa arth megh he
 Often, the mountainous rivers, which are often dry, flow out loud when it rains
 duusari richa se pahari toofaanon se honevaala vriksh-kampan saafe-saafe nazar ke saamne aa jaataa he
 This scene is not possible on the land of Panchanad
 yah us samay kii smriti he, jis samay arya himalayottar pahari pradeshon main rahete honge
 Another Richa which is in the 15th Sukta of the Second Circle of the Rigveda makes it clear that the Aryans came from near the Mansarovar, northeast of Kashmir, the origin of the Indus River, to Punjab
 yah richa nimnlikhit he-sodanchan sindhumarina mahitva vajrenan ushasah sampipev
 Ajavaso Javinibhi: Vishvishna Somasya Ta Mad Madrasvaraka, Indra, with his importance, swept the Indus-river northward and weakened Usha's chariot with his powerful army
 indra yah tab karte hai, jab vah som mad se matt ho jate hai
 The indus-river flows north-facing from its place of origin from Mansarovar to Kashmir; After Kashmir flows south-west
 sambhavtah indra ne pahari durgam maarg ko katkar, sindhu-nadi ke sankeern maarg ko visteern kar uttar kii ore nadi kii dhara svachhnd kar di ho
 This would have made the path of the Aryans very smooth
 yah mat nimnlikhit richa se or bhi drudh ho jaataa he-indrasya nu viryani pravochan yani chakaar prathamani vajri
 Ahn ahi manvapastarda parvakshana pravatanam

 Ya: Tragedy around Chittrittro Mahina: Yatutha Shirbhbhu That is, just as the river flows over the collapsed verges, similarly the happy water is flowing on the lying circle
 jis vrutra ne apni shakti se jal ko jite-ji roak rakkha tha, vahi unke pairon tale padaa hua he
 This view is reminiscent of the view of mountainous regions
 varsha hone ke samay kaale-kaale badalon ke jhund or panktiyaan, bijli kii chamak, tadak-bhadak ke saath garjan or ant main vrishtipaat hone par jal kii atoot dhara tathaa meghon kaa lop ! aise manoram hridayakarshak drishy ko dekhakar-jisamen megh pahaado ke sir par adda jamaaye rahete hai or baras jane par yatra-tatra halake hokar villin ho jate hai-aaryon kaa yah chitra kheenchna bilkul swaabhaavik he
 Such hymns are found in abundance
 tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye irani shakha kaa gatikram diya jaataa he- Both the Rigveda and the zenda-avesta commemorate the long six-month nights of the adjacent territories of the North Pole
 lokmaanya tilak kaa uttareey dhruv ke pradeshon ko aaryon kaa aadi-nivas-bhoomi batalaana tathaa jyotirganana ke aadhaar par khrishtabd se hazaron varsh purv un dhruv-praanton main aaryon ke rahane kaa siddhanth dhruv-sa gyaat hota he
 From there onwards in the Post Glacier Period after the Great Depression, they would have spread over a wide area of siberia, possibly from the modern Ural Mountains on both the east and west sides
 bhootatva-visharadon ke kathananusaar siberia us samay anukool basane yogya aabhohawaa main rahaa hoga, jaisaa ki us maidan ke andar paye jane vaale paudhon or jantuon ke kankal se anumaan kiya jaataa he
 For my convenience i have prepared a map of Eurasia, which is not given with this article
 usamen maine pracheen or arvachin naamon kii tulana kar aaryon kii gati kaa chitra khinchaa he
 This picture, while fictitious, fully supports the geographical order described in the Puranas and epics, along with the support of the theory of Lokmanya
 isse spasht vidit ho jaayga ki puranakaron tathaa mahakavy ke rachayitaaon ko apane adikalin sanathan itihaas or bhugol kaa samaran tha
 They praise their adi-niwas-place by virtue of their diverse praise
 ve un sthanon ko pavitra samajhate or vahaan vividh sukh kii kalpana karte hai
 Buddhist literature, which is being studied vigorously these days, throws light on this subject
 himalayottar-pradeshon tathaa parvatashreniyon ke naamon main sanskritatv kaa abhas mil jaataa he
 i will try to get a glimpse of the ancient status of the Aryans by starting from the North Pole and making reference to such words and equations
 maine apane kalpit maanchitr main arvachin prachlit naamon ko or jahaan-tahaan pracheen puranic naamon ko ankit kiya he
 The north is the mouth of the South Qarasagar of the Ocean and the South Kora of the island of Nova Zembla
 vaayu puraana ke anusaar kuru uttartam pradesh mana gaya he
 The Brahmanda Purana considers it to be south on the banks of the north sea
 padmapurana kuru ke badale airavat ko uttar-samudr ke dakshin or shrungavan-parvatake uttar maanata he
 According to Airavat, Padmapuran is such a place where there is no movement of the sun
 atev brahmandpurana kaa kuru-varsh yaa uttar-kuru hi padmapurana main airavat ho gaya he or padmapurana main, uttar-kuru madhya-asia main aakar meru-parvat ke paas hi uttar or nil-parvat ke paas dakshin ho gaya he
 The Kuru of Vayu Purana is the northernmost region of the Jambudweep; In Padmapuran it has come between India and the North Pole
 yah aaryon ke uttar kii ore se, mahapralay ke baad, asia main aane kaa dyotak he
 i consider the 'kuru' of the Vayupurana, which is near the north-sea, that is, in the dhruva-pradesh - in the places around the mouth of kara-sagar and Kora
 yah kaara-sagar hi padam-puraana yaa brahmand puraana kaa uttar-samudr he
 It is just south of kara-sagar
 aajkal jise North Sea kaha jaataa he, vah yorape ke uttar he
 But at a time when the Aryans lived in the adjacent regions of the North Pole, Kara Sea can only be a sign of the North Sea
 ’kaara’ or ’kora’ shabdon se kuru shabd kaa nikatatam sambandh bhi he
 It seems somewhat sinister to explore the Mountains; But by paying attention to its meaning, it is known that a mountain with its peak can be called Shringwan
 padmapurana uttar-samudr ke baad airavat kaa hona maanata he; or shrung iske dakshin he, atev uttar-samudr or shrung ke bich airavat kaa hona nishchit hua
 There is no movement of the Sun even in this Airavat-year
 airavat shabd ’ir’ dhaatu se bana hua he
 'ir' and 'il' are used in the sense of metal
 atev ’ira’ kaa arth prithvi bhi hota he
 It is also used in the sense of water and Saraswati
 iravat kaa arth samudr or isi prakaar iradhar or iladhar kaa arth pahaad hota he
 We use Eresh in the sense of Varuna
 rugveda main varun kii mahima bahut gaayi gayi he
 Like Indra, Varuna has also gradually become the presiding deity of the Aryans
 iravat kaa arth samudr hone se, airavat kaa arth samudr-tat kaa vaasi ho saktaa he
 The regions of the North Pole do not have the movement of the Sun
 airavat main bhi surya kaa prakaash durbal mana gaya he
 Since it is north of airavat-shringa, the north-eastern regions of the ural-mountains range does not seem to be a hindrance in assuming such
 dekhakar aashcharya hota he ki uttar-dhruv se armbh kar madhya-asia ke pradesh se lekar faras yaa afghanisthaan or bharatvarsh kii arvali-parvat-shrenee tak aise tatsam shabdon kaa taanta laga hua he
 This ural-mountains can be the second base of Aryans
 yaheen ke aas-paas ke sthaan airavat desh ke dyotak hai
 a river named 'ural' also originates from the Ural Mountains
 yah nadi caspian-sagar main girti he
 The meaning of 'ira' is water, erla means river
 aaryon kii yorapia shakha sambhavtah ural-parvat-shrenee ke aasapaas ke pradeshon se hi alag hui
 Its name can be both controversial and ambiguous
 yadi ham isi sthaan ko ilaaspad yaa iraaspad maan len, to yorape ke namakaran main bhi hamen irasp kaa abhas mil jaataa he
 Swami Dayanand has compared Europe with Harivarsha
 hari kaa arth pit or bandar bhi he
 Harineetra also means yellow eyed
 yah harivarsh yorape kaa naam bhi ho saktaa he; parantu principal mahoday ne is harivarsh ko pamir-parvat-shrenee ke uttar or thiyaanshaan ke dakshinvarti pradeshon ke bich batalaaya he
 Since the Aryans took their beloved names with them wherever they went, there is no obstacle in accepting Harivarsha as Europe
 yorapavaasiyon kii netrakriti se bhi yah yuktisangat maaloom hota he
 From behind, Harivarsha became north-himalayan region
 iske anantar vayupurana main hiranmayavarsh kaa hona batalaaya gaya he
 Hiranmay is followed by the White Mountains and followed by the Ramayak-years
 ramyakvarsh ke baad nilparvat or tatpashchaat ilaavruth he
 While ordering these five places in the map of Asia, we can direct the area from Elburz-mountain
 yah elbarz cospian-sagar ke uttar pashchim tak failaa hua he
 North of these mountainous regions is the Caucasus Mountains
 kakesus parvat ke nikatavarti pradesh kii bhoomi, lokmaanya tilak ke purv aaryon kii aadi-bhoomi maani jaati thi
 If we assume the Aryan-covered land around Elberz, the Caucasus, which is northeast of the nile-sea, can take the place of the nile-mountains
 vayupurana nilparvat ke baad ramyakvarsh kaa hona batalaata he
 The Aryans may have migrated from the Airavatvars southward to the coastal regions of the ural-river from the Caspian Sea to the north, from the Caucasus to the Arabian Sea of the Asian turkey
 yah pradesh ural parvat kii tarai hone ke kaaran sundar he tathaa pahari pradesh yahan bahut kam he
 It is quite possible that there was also a white mountain in the mountain range of North Ural of this beautiful land
 shwetsagar korasagar ke pashchim kii ore ab tak vidyaman he
 Vayupurana refers to the year of Shringwan after Airavat and the year of Hiranmay after Shringwan
 yah hiranmayavarsh sambhavtah ural-parvatashrenee ke aasapaas airawatvarsh ke dakshin-pashchim kii ore rahaa hoga
 Or it may extend from the west of the ural-mountains to the banks of the ural-river
 madhyaesia ke pradeshon main aaryon kaa rahanaa or vahaan se bhartiya or irani shakhaon kaa alag-alag hona- isamen andeh he ki arya log ramyakvarsh ke baad airal-sagar kii ore se ’aryaanaa vrajah’ main aaye yaa elbarz ke baad cospian-sagar kepurv kii ore airal-sagar kii ore fail gayi
 It is possible because of the airail-sea equals Airavat
 ural-nadi ke tatavarti pradeshon se hote hue airal kii ore kuch log bad gayi hon or kuch arya kakesus se hote hue phir bhi samyaantar main cospian-sagar ke purvavarti pradeshon kii ore oxs nadi ke taton par airal-sagar tak fail gayi hon
 Since both Aryan branches are said to have been separated from the territories on the banks of this river, and since the first land of Iranian Aryans is 'aryan Vrajah', 'aryan Vrajah' is fixed to the north-west side of the Aksus river
 
 chaahe kahin bhi ho, lekin yah pradesh airal ke dakshin, oxs se purv-uttar or cospian se purv kii ore kahin rahaa hoga; kyonki iske baad iraniyon kaa doosraa pradesh sragdh he
 The Indian branch 'aryanan Vrajah' seems to have separated from the Iranians, it seems
 purvi turki main tajik -naamak arya-jati kaa rahanaa mana ja chukaa he
 It settled back in the mountainous regions of Turkey and there it is called gulch today
 oxs-nadi airal-sagar se nikalati he or yah nirvivaad sa he ki donon shakhayein oxs-nadi ke donon taton par kabhi rahati thim
 When we find out that the Aryans have ever lived in Turkey and when they get an idea of the culture of the Indian Aryans, then to say that the Aryans came from that part of the Oxus-river, which started from the eral-sagar, on the east bank of the river But it is spread, not inappropriate
 irani log samarkand, balkh or marv kii ore badhate gayi or bhartiya aryashakha dakshin-purv pradeshon kii ore badhati-badhati samay paakar thiyaanshaan, tarim or kuenlan-parvatashrenee se sindhu-nadi ke muhane tak fail gayi hogi
 The geographical year-division of the Vayu Purana is often divided by mountain ranges
 ham upar dikhaa chuke hai ki kis prakaar prayek varsh parvaton yaa sagaron se seemaabaddh he
 We also see that there is a vast plain stretching from the Albarz-mountain range to the banks of the river Oxus, some part of which must be called 'aryan Vrajah'
 chunki ilavrivarsh ke baad vayupurana main meru-parvat kaa naam aayaa he, isse kahana padataa he ki elbarz-parvat se meru tak kaa bhubhag ’aryaanaa vrajah’ kaa dyotak rahaa hoga
 The western edge of the Oxus can be said to have been in the hands of the Iranians and the eastern edge of the Indian Aryans
 elbarz or meru ke bich kaa bhubhag us samay upjau or sukhad rahaa hoga tathaa aaryon ke sangharsh kaa kaaran bhi yahi bana hoga
 The Iranian branch, possibly being overpowering and relatively illiterate, may have prevented the Indian branch from moving towards the southwest ie Iran, and the Indian branch was forced to seek refuge in the mountainous regions
 yah meru-parvat koun sa parvat he, yah abhi tak thik-thik nahin kaha ja sakaa he; parantu jab ham dekhte hai ki mahabharat main kimpurushavarsh ke baad haatak, haatak ke baad maansarovar, maansarovar ke baad sameep hi gandharv or gandharv ke baad harivarsh yani uttar-kuru he, to hamen kahana padataa he ki yah harivarsh thiyaanshaan-parvat ke dakshin or pamir ke purvavarti pradesh kaa naam rahaa hoga
 Turkistan is a desert surrounding these regions
 yah marubhumi us samay kis dashaamein thi, yah kahana to mushkil he; parantu isaki dasha us samay aaj kii-si hi hogi, yah sandehatmak he
 Possibly this condition is caused by ice due to street rocks
 chini bhashaa main ’thiyaan’ kaa arth swarg or ’shaan’ kaa arth pahaad he
 We find a description of the regions of north-kuru in the Mahabharata or in Buddhist literature as a paradise
 ham alti-parvat ke naam main bhi sanskrit kii chhap pate hai
 Could this be the northern boundary of the Thianshan north-kuru-territories? Could not the Aryans move south-east from the intermediate route of Thianshan and Pamir? Couldn't the Gobi Desert be in good condition at that time? Was the land in the north or west of Mansarovar never the land of the Aryans? Our literature tells about India's relation with the North Himalayas
 isaki smritiyaan, jahaan dekhiye vahiin prachur maatra main padi hui hai
 There is a need to study them and throw new light on Indian history
 hamen meru pamir ko maananaa ho chaahe thiyaanshaan ko, donon haalaton main harivarsh yani uttarkuru ko maansarovar ke uttar hona maananaa hi padegaa
 According to Mahabharata, Buddhism, Purana or Ramayana - this is the north-kuru - whose description of humans is somewhat strange from the inhabitants of Kuru, ie Indian Aryans, and which is the beloved land of Indian Aryans, whose imaginary remembrance also makes each Arya cheerful today
 Gives, on the basis of which all the heavens of heaven are located - north of India
 himalay aaj bhi aryasahitya kii sristi kaa pradhan uttejk he
 It is not fiction - not mythology - it is fact
 hamaare sur, hamaare indra, varun or kuber, yaksha or gandharv--sabhi himalay ke uttar hai
 After Meru, the land of Harivarsha, Naishadh, Kimpurush, Hemkut and Bharatvarsha has been the land of Aryans
 isamen kavitv nahin, kora sahitya nahin, ek achal aitihaasik satya he
 We find this principle even stronger when we look at the history of Somers
 rugveda ke sabhi devtaa somras ke matvaale hai; aaryon ke sabhi yagyon main somras kii pag-pag par aavashyaktaa he
 An entire congregation of the Rigveda is dedicated to som-praise
 avesta main bhi iskaa naam he Haum, parantu isaki vah mahima nahin, jo aaryon ke rugveda main he
 In the Avesta, Indra, who is a drinker of Somaras, becomes merely Demon and here Indra becomes the sole savior of the Aryans
 hamaare yahan sura kii ek katha prachlit he
 This is nothing but the Sura Somaras
 pehle sur or asur donon arya hi the; parantu jin logon ne sura nahin grahan kii, ve asur or jinhone grahan kii, ve sur kahalaaye
 This verse of Ramayana is like this - Surapratigrahadeva: Sura Ityabhivishruta
 apratigrahana tasya daiteyashchasurasttha
 We have mentioned Diti and Aditi above
 ye daitya asur kahalaaye or ’aryaanaa vrajah’ se, jo kashyap-sagar se purv-uttar or dakshin kii ore failaa hua he, donon alag-alag ho gayi
 Astu, we have to see why Somaras were so dear to the Aryans? Indra is defeated by Somaras and defeats demons and demons
 himalayottar-pradesh main, jo swabhaavatah thandha rahaa hoga or he, somras kaa pinaa aswabhaavik nahin
 The crushing of the stones of the Somaras can be traced back to the multiplicity in the Rigveda
 somalata himalay kii tarai yaa himalayottar-pradesh-- khaaskar karakoram ke aasapaas ab bhi paayi jaati he
 This Som is the property of the Indian Aryans
 ahuron kaa isse koi sambandh nahin
 Surely the sur-dal have had to face difficulties due to coming to the hilly regions; But som is the basis of his life
 yah padaarth, yah ras himalayottar pradesh kaa hi samaran karaata he
 Although the subject of this article has nothing to do with Mahenjodaro and Harappa, these discoveries and their decisions help us a lot in the decision of the time of Mahabharata
 mahenjodaaro main jis sabhyataa kaa pataa chalaa he, uskaa samay khrishtabd se 3,200 yaa 3,300 varsh purv nishchit kiya gaya he
 5,000 years ago, when there was such a civilization in the northwestern region of India, in which iron smelting, brick building, canal selfing, marble work, art, craftsmanship and use of glass were prevalent, at that time India In other parts, there would have been such a civilization which could have benefited from this civilization or possessed it
 is 1923 i
 ke avishkaar kii jo sabase badi mahatta he, vah yah he ki us samay bharat main lipi prachlit thi
 By this, the European scholars say that the Indians did not know to write a few hundred years before Christ, it becomes absolutely untrue and baseless
 parantu ek baat, jo bahut hi khatkati he, yah he ki yah sabhyataa aaryon kii nahin, pratyut anaryon kii he
 The basis of this theory is that the invented substances here have such easel and linga and complete and semi-tombstones that do not match the art of the Aryans
 ye padaarth mesopotemia, mishra or cret ke tatkaaleen sambandh ke dyotak bataaye jate hai
 Historian of the hindu-university Mr
 Ar
 D
 Banerjee, MA These easels and lingas doubt the Aryan Shivalinga or imitation of the easels; Because these sexes as well as the Arya-system do not have Arghyapatta or Gauripatta, it is therefore an imitation of the Linga of Babylonia, not the Shivalinga of Shaivas
 iske sivaa us samay kii agnipuja kii vidhi aaryon kii agnipuja kii vidhi se milti-julati nahin he
 He compared the partial tombstone - in which people used to leave the dead body on the scaffold and bury it in an earthen pot when the bone is residual - compared to the partial mausoleum practiced in the modern Mundas of Chhotanagpur
 yahan par praapt khopadiyaan bhi madraas ke dravidon kii shakl kii paayi jaati hai
 In the Virat Parva of Mahabharata, the Pandavas kept their weapons hidden on cloth, on the emulation of partial samadhi
 yah adhyaaapak banerjee mahoday ne bhi likhaa he
 It is known that during the time of Pandavas, such custom must have been in the wild castes
 vaidic sahitya main iskaa varnan yaa sanket na milanaa koi aashcharya nahin
 The period of Mahabharata is considered to be 3,000 years before Christ according to Hindu system
 yah samay is mahenjodaaro ke samay se mil jaataa he
 During the Mahabharata, it is also mentioned that there are wild castes
 yah hamen mahabharat-kaal ko aaj se 5,000 varsh purv hataane main koi aadchan nahin daal saktaa he
 The truth is that according to Mohenjodaro, we have to change the program of our history
 ham puraanon or mahakavyon kaa adhyayan kar is jatil samay ke prashn ko hal kar sakate hai
 In its new light, we can throw new light on history
 mahabharat kab likhaa gaya tathaa kab-kab isaki kaaya main parivardhan hota gaya, yah sochane par bhi ham mahabharat ke samay par avishvaas nahin kar sakate
 Believing the 'yugpuran' of Gargasamhita, as has been said above, from Mahabharata till date i

 ishwar jane, yah suyog hamen kab milegaa; parantu yah dekhakar santosh hota he ki in dinon kya yorapia or kya bhartiya vidvan puraanon ke adhyayan kii ore agrasar ho rahe hai
 Astu, the day is not far when the complete history of Aryans can be found in our literature
 lekh bahut bad gaya, parantu upsanhaar main kuch kah dena aavashyak hone ke kaaran yahi kahana alam he ki rugveda or avesta ke adhyayan ke baad puranic tathaa buddha sahitya ke adhyayan karne par hamen himalayottar-pradeshon kaa sachcha aitihaasik parichay mil saktaa he
 If we follow the Vedas and other Sanskrit literatures with the view of Indian Aryans coming to India from the Himalayas not once, but through many routes from time to time, then its interpretation becomes very simple, comprehensible and historical
 aashaa he, bhartiya itihaas ke premi vidvan or vidhyaarthee lokmaanya tilak kii bataayi sarini par agrasar ho, apane itihaas kaa jirnoddhar kar hamaare andhkaar ko dur karenge
 One more thing, the way European scholars have been inspired by selfish intellect, as our glorious history started to give a frivolous and hey form, there is probably a lot of delay in getting rid of it
 hamaari aankhon par apana itihaas dekhne ke liye bhi yorapia chashma lagane kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 What can be more shameful than this, that we disbelieve in the only authentic history of the Aryans, the Puranas, Buddhist literature and other literature, and search through the information rate for information about Indian history
 puraanon main aaryon kaa bhugolic gyaan bharaa padaa he
 We can find out the places mentioned in these only when it is fully understood that the Aryan civilization had spread to those countries at the time when this geography was written
 chakravartitv praapt karne ke liye bhartiya raajaaon kaa desh-deshaantar jaakar raajaaon ko parajeet karnaa ek parampara kii baat thi
 Arjuna's going to the North Himalayas for Digvijay is not a fantasy of Mahabharata, but is an intact truth
 sach to yah he ki bhartiya arya--chaahe ve bharat ke aadim-nivasee rahe hon or anya arya yaheen se anyatra sansar main faile hon, jaisaa ki kai vidwaanon kii dharna he, chaahe ve tilak ke kathananusaar uttareey dhruv se aate-aate ant main bharat pahunche hon--bhugol kii purna jaankaree rakhte the
 To distrust that geography and history is a great crime against the ancient Aryans
 abhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki aaryon kii aadi-bhoomi koun-si he
 It is a natural belief of every Indian that India is the creation of the Aryans - the eternal sports-place
 jo kuch satya sabit ho, abhi to hamen yorapia vidwaanon ke mayajaal ke phande se nikalakar swatantra rup se apane pracheen itihaas kaa pataa lagaana he
 Today's history, which has been kept for our reading, can only be called a farce or novel
 aryaavart se lekar harivarsh tak kaa itihaas hamaare pracheen aaranyak yaa puranic sahitya hi bataa sakate hai
 God bless us, we should be committed to this and start looking into our literature
 kya prayek arya-santaan ko is sabhyataa kii aadi-janani, kutuhal-mayi, vishuddh arya-gaatha ke jaanane kii laalasaa nahin hoti ? Assuming Arjuna's journey to be true and comparing the geographical names given in the Puranas to modern names, it is said that in the time of Mahabharata i

 5,000 years before today, Indian Aryans up to Harivarsha i

 the adjacent Himalayan regions of Mount Thianshan Had complete knowledge till date
 isi harivarsh ko us samay arya log uttar-kuru kehete the tathaa aryaavart ke ’kuru’ ko usee uttar-kuru kii smriti-raksha ke liy basaaya
 The meaning of 'aryan Vrajah' of central-asia is found in Aryavarta
 korasagar se jo Arctic Circle main he aarambh kar arya log sidhe uttar kii ore puraana nirdisht maarg se aaye, isamen sandeh nahin he
 The 'ir' metal has an undeniable and close relationship with the ural-nadi and aral-sagar
 ’ir’ se hi airavat bana he
 Its proper discussion has been done one by one before
 airal-sagar ke pashchim kii ore elbarz he
 i have compared Yorp to Erasya, Yada, or Suspicious
 airal-sagar se nadi nikalati he
 The Aryans stayed on both sides of this river for some time and from here Arya and Irani separated
 iraniyon kaa maarg tabhi se badal gaya or bhartiya aaryon kaa thiyaanshaan, pamir, maansarovar, tarim aadi se hokar kashmir yaa hindukush ke maarg se aana hua
 On arrival in Sindh, he met the Iranian branch across the border; Because they too had reached Kabul by now
 bhartiya aaryon kaa uttar-dhruv se lekar aryaavart tak kaa sidhaa varnan yahi batalaata he
 Mansarovar and Himalaya are his only ideals
 kabul ke maarg se ve abhi nahin aaye, balki bharat main padaarpan ke baad ve kabul kii ore bhi faile
 It is extremely difficult to decide at what time he came to India
 kam-se-kam 5,000 varsh purv to mahabharat kaa samay he, jis samay arya bahut puraane pad gayi the
 The Rigveda verses were also written along the banks of Indus and Saraswati
 lokmaanya ke siddhanth kii pushti puranic bhugol se purnatah hoti he
 The belief that Aryans lived in India from the beginning is true or untrue
 parantu itnaa to nishchit he ki bhartiya rishiyon kaa jo samay-nirupan ab-tak mana ja rahaa he, vah satya siddh hoga
 And, in this case, the Aryavata settles in the Aryavarta thousands of years before the Mahabharata

 He came to India three times by ship

 Vasco da Gama was presumably born in 1460 or 1469 near the southwest coast of Signs, Portugal
 inkaa ghar nossa senhora das salas ke girijaghar ke nikat sthit tha
 The erstwhile Signs, now one of the few ports on the coast of Alentejo, then had a cluster of whitewashed, red-roofed fishermen's huts

 vasco da gamma ke parivaar kii aarambhik jaankaree adhik gyaat nahin he
 Portuguese historian Teixeira de Aragão states that Vasco da Gama was educated in the city of राvora, where he may have acquired knowledge of mathematics and navigation
 yah bhi gyaat he ki gamma ko khagolashastra kaa bhi gyaan tha, jo unhone sambhawatah khagolgy abraham zakuto se liya hoga
 In 1492, King John II of Portugal sent Gama south of the port of Setubal, Lisbon
 unhen vahaan se francisi jahaajon ko pakad kar laana tha
 Vasco completed this task with skill and readiness

 He told his father this
 jon kaa ek sevak abhi suta se muslim qaidiyon ke badale dhan lekar lautaa tha
 After the coming of Islam under the rule of the last seven hundred years, it would certainly have been a selective task if Suta was defeated by the Portuguese invasion
 suta naa sirf ek vyast pattan bazaar tha, balki us samay morocco, pichley 30 saalon se araajaktaa main fansaa tha
 After much disrespect and Queen Philippa's insistence, John prepared a plan of attack
 holend par akraman kii taiyaari ke mukhute lagaakar suta par akraman kar diya
 In July 1415, Ceuta was conquered
 henry, edward or peter teenon ne is yuddh main senaanee kaa kaam kiya
 But nothing was achieved financially - the Muslims started trading with Tanziers instead of Sutah, and the ports of Sayuta remained empty
 us samay europe main kai bhrantiyaan prachlit thi
 One of them was that in Africa, somewhere in the south, a gold river flows
 par vahaan pahunchne kaa matlab he sahaara marusthal main maujuud muslim arab or barbar sena ko haraana
 In Henry's view it was possible and necessary to do this - after all, seven hundred years ago North Africa was under Christian occupation

 Tangier was farther away and more secure

 lekin nausenicon ke samay par naa pahunchne ke baavjood henry, bachi-khuchi 7000 kii sena lekar tengier 1437 main pahunch gaya
 As expected - he had to face defeat
 uske senapatiyon ne waapas nikalne kii keemat suta ko moraccan haathon main saunpane kii baat kii
 Henry did not approve of this - he kept his brother Ferdinand as a hostage

 Meanwhile, Usmani Turks gained control over Istanbul in May 1453

 Diego again traveled to Namibia in 1486, once again in search of his goal - just 800 kilometers north of the southern point of Africa
 lekin, lautate samay wo congou main prester jon ko dhundne niklaa or phir uskaa koi pataa nahin chalaa
 One of the misconceptions prevalent in Europe was that somewhere in the east, there lived a king named Prester John, who is a Christian and owns immense wealth
 purtagaaliyon ko bharosa tha ki ye raja bharat kaa raja he
 To find out, Portuguese King John sent two detectives on a landward journey to the east
 lekin jerusalem pahunchne ke baad unhen maaloom hua ki arabi siikhe bina aage badhanaa sambhav nahin he - ve laut gaye
 After this, in May 1487, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Peva were sent on a secret journey
 ve misr main sikandriyaa or kahiraa pahunch gaye
 Pero Aden from them reached Calicut via Red Sea
 vyapaar or margon ko usne nirikshan kiya or kahiraa laut gaya
 There he met two Portuguese Jews who were sent by King John
 jaankariyon kaa aadan pradaan hua or kowilha dakshin kii ore ithiopia chalaa gaya
 He wanted to return from there, but seeing his world knowledge, King Alexander appointed his advisor and promised to send him to Portugal later
 lekin wo jaldi mar gaya or uske bete ne uski ye kaamana puri nahin kii
 Kovilha settled there
 san 1526 ke kisi portugali mishan ne baad main paaya ki kowilha ithiopia main tandoorust, safal or swasth avasthaa main tha - usne vahiin shaadi kar lee or 74 varsh kii aayu main mara
 In August of 1487, the Portuguese king sent a sailor named Bartolomeo Dias to travel to Africa
 wo pehla european navik tha jo dakshintam africa ke tat - uttamasha antareep - ke paar pahunchaa
 But returned after being defeated by a fierce storm
 lekin uske pashchim se purab kii taraf ja sakane se yah sabit ho gaya ki africa kaa dakshini konaa he or duniya yaheen khatm nahin ho jaati
 Meanwhile, King Manuel proposed the idea of a four-boat crew to India
 is dal kaa captain gamma ko chunaa gaya
 Many were astonished by this - because Gama did not experience any major maritime challenge other than the battles around
 lekin anushaasit or raja ke vishwast hone ke kaaran use niyukt kar liya gaya
 On 8 July 1497, four ships left Lisbon and began their first voyage to India
 lagbhag 170 logon ke is bede ke anya mahatvapurn naamon main martim aphonso or farnaao martins kaa naam tha
 Afonso had lived in the Congo and knew African dialects, while Fernao was an imprisonment in Morocco due to his imprisonment
 das se baarah abhiyukt bhi is jahaji bede main raja dwaara rakhe gaye the jinako khataranaak sthalon par jaankaree or khoji kaamon ko puraa karne kaa kaam diya gaya tha
 As expected, there were no women aboard the ship
 chalane ke ek saptaah baad, 15 july ko wo kenneri tak pahunche or uske baad chhaae dhundh kii vajah se jahaaj alag ho gaye
 They were scheduled to meet in Cape Verde, but Paolo de Gama did not see any other ship there
 halanki berio or bhandaaran jahaaj kuch ghanto ke bheetar aa gaye
 Gamma's ship was not found for the next four days
 milane ke baad wo vahaan ek saptaah tak ruke or phir 3 agast ko ravaanaa hue
 In all the Portuguese voyages so far, sailors' ships had passed through the Nicach off the coast of Africa - also to Bartelomeo Dias
 lekin ek tufaani hawa, jo khule atlantic main bahati he navikon ko uttamasha antareep tak teji se dhakel detii he -aisa vasco da gamma ne sun rakhaa tha
 Instead of turning east, his own sailors were told to walk south in the open sea instead of walking in Africa
 kai dinon tak khule samudr main chalane or koi jameen yaa aashaa na dekhne ke baad 1 navambar wo jameen ke nikat aae
 It must have been some 150 kilometers before Uttamaha
 logon main khushi kii lahar daud gai
 After restoring the ship and seeing its maps, people rested
 jahaaj par maujuud vrittantkaar ne likhaa ki logon kii chamadi kaa rang bhura he, ve sil, whale yaa hiran kaa maance or vanaspati kii jadi khate he
 They wear leather garments and dogs always walk with them
 vahaan se wo 16 navambar ko chale
 The Bulkul coast line did not match the map of Bertlemeo Dias, but the bay continued to move and reached Uttamaasha Antip on 22 November
 vahaan par dias dwaara sthaneey logon ke saath hue jhadpon kii khabar unhen mil chuki thi, lekin unke saath bhi vahaan par jhadap ho gai
 After repairing the ships, he left from there on 7 December
 16 disambar ko wo us nadi ke muhane par pahunche jahaan se bartelomeu dias ke navikon ne use waapas jane par majaboor kiya tha
 He saw a cross installed by Dias there
 iske baad ke raaston par aaj tak koi nahin pahunchaa tha - isliye pehle se bane maanchitr bekaar ho gaye or unhen nayaa maanchitr bananaa padaa
 They moved north along the coast
 chunki vah christmas ke aasapaas kaa samay tha, da gamma ke karmidal ne ek tat kaa naam, jisase hokar ve guzar rahe the, "nataal" rakhaa
 It means "christmas" in Portuguese and the name of that place is still in use till date
 janvari tak ve log aaj ke mozambik tak pahunch gaye the, jo purvi africa kaa ek tateey kshetra he jisapar arab logon ne hind mahaasaagar ke vyapaar network ke ek bhaag ke rup main niyantran kar rakhaa tha
 They were chased by an angry mob who came to know that they are not Muslims and they proceeded to Kenya
 kenya ke mombasa main bhi uskaa virodh hua
 After arriving, he was told that there are many Christians living in the city of Mombasa
 jahaaj ko tat se dur rakhane ke baad kuch navik shahar ke daure par gaye jahaan unhen gore isaiyon se mulaakaat hui
 Later it was learned that after receiving news from Mozambique, the Sultan there had prepared a plan to trap him
 gamma vahaan se bhaag niklaa - par use bharat pahunchne ke liye dishaao ke jaankaar navikon yaa nideshkon kii zarurat thi
 He caught four people coming on a small boat
 ek buudhe musalmaan vyapaaree ne bataaya ki paas ke tat malindi main bhartiya navik rahete hai
 Vasco reached Malindi seeing no choice
 bharatiyon ko deshkar use laga ki ye isai he - krishna ke uccharan ko wo christ samaj rahe the
 In Malindi, The Gama hired an Indian guide, who led the Portuguese on the forward route and brought them to Calicut, Kerala, on 20 May 1498, which is located on the southwest coast of India
 vahaan ke raja ne unhen kalikat ke pattan par aane kaa nyauta diya lekin gamma ke raah main itani baadhaayen ain thim ki use laga ki ye bhi dushman hi honge
 But he met Vali to meet and then Zamorin welcomed Gamma to Calicut with music
 vahaan par raaj-darbar main aane se pehle use ek mandir mila jahaan andar main use ek devi kii murti mila
 The Portuguese felt that this was a statue of Mary and she was convinced that Zamorin was a Christian ruler
 wo murti shaayad mariammaa devi kii thi jise wo isamsih kii maan mariyam samaj rahe the
 The comedian who was included in the group with Gamma who was welcomed by Jamorin wrote - "the people of this country are brown, short-sighted and at first look jealous and mean
 mard qamar ke upar kuch nahin pahante 
 Some have long hair, while many have shaved heads
 mahilaayein saamanyatya sundar nahin dikhti hai
 "fernão Martins translated Gamma into Arabic meeting Zamorin
 darbar main muslim salaahkaaron ne use vyapaar kii baat karne main kai adchane paidaa kii
 He ridiculed Gama's gift and delayed him to meet the king
 iske alaave uske paas raja ke liye uchit koi uphaar bhi nahin tha
 For this reason he had a fight with Zamorin
 zamorin ke muslim mantriyon ne usase vyapaar kaa kar maanga
 Zamorin also refuses to erect the pillar he had requested
 sulah or phir ladaai chalati rahi
 The king's Muslim ministers kidnapped many people from his entourage
 lekin samudr main unke jahaaj par aae graahakon ko gamma ne bandi bana liya
 Finally he was allowed to leave and in the end of August he left - the king also gave him a citation in Malayalam containing a message to King John of Portugal that Vasco had come here
 lekin agle hi din koi 70 arabi jahaaj vahaan akraman ke liye aate dikhe
 In response, he fired
 kuch bhartiya bandhakon ke saath sitambar 1498 main waapas portugal ke liye laut gaya
 He reached the Swahili coast again in January
 jahaaj par koi 500 din guzar gaye the - log thak or biimaar ho chale the
 While living some 2 weeks away from home on the West African coast, his brother - and captain of one of the crew's three ships, Paulo the Gamma - fell ill and was killed
 usne baaqi jahaajon ko lisbon laut jane kaa aadesh diya or bhai ko dafanaane ke baad apane dal se peeche lisbon pahunchaa
 He received a fierce reception there
 gamma ne waapas aakar apana vrittant raja manuel ko sunaaya
 Contrary to his prejudices, he found the Christians of India different and could not recognize Portugal - which surprised him
 bharat main muslimon kii upasthiti se bhi use duvidha hui
 Seeing the Muslim rule everywhere in Africa and the number of Muslim merchants in the Arabian Sea, he remembered his "christian duty" and sent two more missions within two years
 janvari 1500 isvi kaa samay bahut hi shubhankar laga, par mishan bhejne main 2 maheenon kii deree ho gai
 In March 1500, 13 ships headed by Pedro ारेlvarez Cabral sailed from Lisbon
 unka lakshya africa or bharat main vyapaar ke aadhaar lagane ke alaave jamorin ko muslim vyapaariyon ko bhaga dene kaa aagrah bhi tha
 But many ships were lost in order to go southwest and then east of Gamma's stated approach to reach Uttamaasha
 kaabral kalikat pahunchaa - nae jamorin ne europea jahaajon kaa vyapaar sweekaar kiya or suraksha kaa aashwaasan diya
 But Arab merchants had reached the port for that year
 kebral ne arab jahaaj ko pakad liya - ye kahkar ki ye jamorin ke saath hui vyapaar sandhi kaa ulanghan he
 In response, he killed all 70 people of the Portuguese factory
 lekin kaabral kii yatra purna asafalataa nahin thi - usne aate vaqt sophala or kilva ke raajaaon se sampark sthapit kiya
 He also went to Coonoor in India and some ships that were "lost" - reached South America
 isse pehle ke kabral laut paata, manuel pratham ne hoaao da nova ke netritv main 4 jahaajon ke saath niklaa
 a message left by Kabral was found hanging in an old shoe on the coast of Africa and reached Calicut
 vahaan pahunchakar usne kai muslim jahaajon par akraman kiya
 a factory in Coonoor returned to Lagar, Portugal
 is prakaar portugal ke jahaajon ne agle 20 saalon ke liye usne kalikat ke shaskaon se dushmani mol le lee
 In 1502, Vasco was repatriated
 uski agali yatra 1502 main hui, jab use ye gyaat hua kii kalikat ke logon ne peeche chhot gaye sabhi portugaliyon ko maar daalaa he
 He dismantled all the Indian and Arab ships en route to his voyage and proceeded to control Calicut and seized much wealth
 isse portugal kaa raja usase bahut prasann hua
 He also went to Cochin, Coonoor and Goa
 cochin ke dakshin main use sadiyon se rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa chalaa
 Gama left some Portuguese there and the ruler of that city also asked him to leave everything he had left there, but he escaped from there
 uski duusari yatra portugali raja ke mishan ke hisaab se bahut safal rahaa kyonki usne arab vyapaariyon ke kadi ladaai kii - jamorin ko vyapaar ke liye majaboor kiya or bharat main rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1524, he set out on his last visit to India
 us samay portugal kii bharat main upnivesh basti ke viceroy ke rup main aayaa, par vahaan pahunchne ke kuch samay baad uski mrityu ho gai
 Vasto de Gama was one of the most important ocean explorers after Portuguese prince and explorer Henry
 teen mahadeshon or do mahasaagaron ko paar karne ke baad bhi arab sagar main arab vyapaariyon or africa samrajyon se ladane or phir bharat aakar apane saath laae portugali raaj-sandesh tathaa uski hifaazat ke liye raja se yuddh or safalataa uske drudh-nishchay ko dikhaati he
 Vasco was rewarded as a successful soldier in Portugal upon his return
 apane samakaleen columbus ke mukaable uski lambi yatra main bhi baghaavat nahin hui or thakne ke baad bhi apane lakshya par jame rahaa
 The spice trade of Arab and Moore merchants was greatly hit when Vasco da Gama reached India
 is vyapaar ko hathiyaane ke liye vasco da gamma ne na sirf khatarnaak or parishramee yatra kii, balki kai yuddh bhi ladaa
 With the help of his superior guns, he was successful in most battles
 isse adan -hormuj -kalikat jal-vyapaar maarg tut yaa kamazor pad gaya
 Seeing his success, King Manuel of Portugal undertook many missions in India and the East
 albukark, jo uski tasri yatra se pehle portugal se bheja gaya tha, ne arab sagar main arabon ke vyapaar or saamudrik sena or sampatti ko tahas-nahas kar diya or khoji malaysia or phir china tak pahunch gaye
 By the sixteenth century, broken Arabic became the language of Portuguese trade instead of Arabic
 is samay portugal ek saamudrik shakti ban gaya
 Where he once reached in India is named vasco-di-gama in his honor
 chaand ke ek gadhde kaa or portugal main kai sadakon kaa naam vasco ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Originally made in 2011, he is portrayed as a villain in the Malayalam film Urumi, directed by Santosh Shivan

 Scholars estimate that Kamban stayed a few days in the shelter of this generous man
 isiilie unhone apane kavy main shadyappavallar kaa aadar evam kritagyata ke saath samaran kiya he
 It is also known that Kamban also visited the court of Chola and Chera kings, but he has not dedicated his magnum opus to any of the said kings

 By his time, there were twelve major saints, and the tradition of Acharyas, Yamun, Ramanuja, who did the classical interpretation of Bhakti and Pratapati, also went on
 kamban ke pramukh alwar "nammalwar" kii prashasti kii he
 It is said that the Ramayana of Kamban was accepted to Ranganath only when he praised Nammalwar at the beginning of the said book
 itnaa hi nahin, kamb ramayana main yatra-tatra ukt alwar kii shrisuctiyon kii chaaya bhi dikhaai padati he, to bhi kamban ne apane mahakavy ko keval sampradayik nahin banaaya he, unhone shiv vishnu ke rup main bhi paramatma kaa stvan kiya he or ramchandra ko us paramatma kaa hi avatar mana he
 The above facts appear from the verses of Mangalacharan presented at the beginning of the book and at the beginning of each case

 That is why Kamb Ramayana was equally respected among Shaivites and Vaishnavites and it helped enough to overcome the mutual disharmony between the two sects
