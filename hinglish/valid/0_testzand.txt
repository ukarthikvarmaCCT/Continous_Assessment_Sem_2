 When it was felt that many spellings of the same word were found, then there was a search for a meaningful word to express them
 is kaaran se maanakeekaran kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii jane lagi
 The absence of its use in the authentic Hindi dictionary published in 1950, along with the early versions of the Hindi Shabdasagar and the abridged Hindi Shabdasagar, indicate that no need for the word was understood until the middle of this century
 chathe dashak main vartanee shabd ko sthaan mila, jiskaa sandarbh tab prakashit hui do pustakon main miltaa he: Pro
 According to Srivastava, the Hindi spelling problem is not as severe as that of English, because it is purely phonetic; Because even today the written word in Hindi is not much different from its accented form
 inhone akshari shabd kaa prayog kiya, jo prachlan main nahin aa sakaa; kyonki usee samay lekhak ne cilibill ke liye akshar kaa prayog apane doctoret ke granth hindi bhashaa main ‘akshar’ tathaa shabd kii seemaa’ main sthir kar diya
 By that time, the 'description' in Bihar was the word 'banana' in Bengal for spelling spelling
 iske alaava prachlan main kuch anya shabd the -aksharnyas, akshar vinyas, varnanyas, varna vinyas, aadi
 Education professor Krishna Gopal Rastogi used the word syllable for a long time
 yahi varna vinyas he
 In Amarkosh, the syllable for script and the use of writing is also found as a synonym
 uparyukt sabhi shabdon ke hote hue bhi ab is arth main ‘vartanee’ hi maanya ho gaya or bharat sarkaar ke kendriya hindi nideshaalay, nai dilli ne na keval is shabd ko manyata di, varan ekarupata kii drushti se kuch niyam bhi sthir kiye hai
 The spelling word is also from the Sanskrit language, Acharya Nishantketu, giving etymology, has given the lexicographical meanings of the word 'spelling': - the path, path, live, life and other meanings: grinding, powder making, pillow
 gyanmandal, varanasi dwaara prakashit ‘brihad hindi kosh’ main pehali baar vartanee kaa arth hijje diya gaya
 After much deliberation, the very broad definition of spelling was fixed: bhashaa-samrajya ke antargat bhi shabdon kii seemaa main aksharon kii jo aachaar sahita athwa unka anushaasangat samvidhan he, use hi ham vartanee kii sangya de sakate hai
 xxrep 4 
 Spelling is the current of the language
 vartanee bhashaa kaa anushaasit aavartan he, vartanee shabdon kaa sanskarita pad vinyas he
 The spelling is the bridge between the past and the future
 yah akshar santhaan or varna kram vinyas he
 Acharya Raghunath Prasad Chaturvedi expressed this by establishing its relation to Sanskrit grammar discourse
 vaarthik evam vartanee donon shabdon ke dhvanisamya evam arthsamya main samanta he
 There is a scientific analysis of the word cultivation through the sutra and in the discourse the flawed statement is fully considered by the sutras
 vartanee bhi isi samanaantar prakriya se guzarati he
 The collective purely form of spelling is also acceptable for the prosperity of the language
 vartanee shabd ke virdohi hote hue bhi acharya vaajapeyi is shabd ke utthan hetu inkaa yogadan tathaa hindi kii vartanee tathaa shabd vishleshan ullekhneey hai

 is disha main kai diggajon ne apana yogadan diya, jinamein se acharya kishoridas vaajapeyi tathaa acharya ramchandra verma ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Due to the substantial increase in the number of Hindi learners within and outside the country as a result of the acceptance of the official language of the Union of Hindi language and some states, it seemed necessary and time-bound to set the standard system of Hindi spelling, so that more uniformity in the spelling of Hindi words Can be brought tadnusaar, shiksha mantralay, bharat sarkaar ne 1961 main hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek visheshgy samiti niyukt kii

 Lingayatism is a part of the oldest Sanatan Hindu religion of India
 is mat ke zyaadaatar anuyaayi dakshin bharat main hai
 This opinion is based on the worship of Lord Shiva
 bhagwaan shiv jo satya sundar or sanathan hai, jinase sristi kaa udgaar hua, jo aadi anant hai
 In Hinduism, there is a description of the trinity, in which the name of Lord Shiva comes first
 shiv jinase sristi kii utpatti hui
 After this, the origin of Lord Brahma, who gives life to the whole world
 bhagwaan vishnu jo sampoorn jagat ke paalanhaar hai
 The third part is the origin of Lord Mahesh, that is, destroying the liberated souls and re-establishing life in the liberation cycle
 lingayat sampradaay bhagwaan shiv jo ki brahma, vishnu, mahesh, charachar jagat ke utpatti ke kaarak hai unki stuti aradhana karata he
 In other words, you can call them followers of Shaivism
 is sampradaay kii sthapana 12veen shatabdi main mahatma basavannaa ne kii thi
 The worshipers of this religion are called Lingayats
 yah shabd kannada shabd lingwant se vyutpann he
 These people mainly follow the teachings of Mahatma Basavanna
 'virshaiv' kaa shabdic arth he - 'jo shiv kaa param bhakt ho'
 But with the passage of time, Veerashaiva's philosophy, philosophy, practice, rituals, social mobilization, Acharanyam etc
 became different from other sects
 yadhyapi virshaiv desh ke anya bhaagon - maharashtra, andhra, tamil kshetra aadi - main bhi paae jate hai kintu unki sabase adhik sankhya karnataka main pai jaati he
 Shaivites derive their religious beliefs and philosophy from the Vedas and the 28 Shaivagams
 virshaiv bhi vedon main avishvaas nahin prakat karte kintu unke darshan, karmkand tathaa samajasudhar aadi main aisi vishistataaen viksit ho gai hai jinaki vyutpatti mukhya rup se shaivagamon tathaa aise antardrushti yogiyon se hui maani jaati he jo 'vachanakaar' kehalaate hai
 In the nearly three centuries between the 12th and 16th centuries, there have been some 300 pledges, of which 30 have been women
 inamen sabase prasiddh naam basav kaa he jo kalyaan ke jain raja vijjal kaa pradhan mantri tha
 He was not only a yogi mahatma but also a karmat Sanghatanaka who established the Veerashaiva sect
 vaasav kaa lakshya aisa aadhyatmik samaaj bananaa tha jisamen jati, dharm yaa stripurush kaa bhedbhaav na rahe
 He was opposed to ritualistic fanatics and emphasized the truth of mental purity and devotion
 vah maatr ek ishwar kii upasna kaa samarthak tha or usne puja tathaa dhyaan kii paddati main saralata laane kaa praytn kiya
 a wonderful revolution arose in the society due to the end of caste discrimination and the rise of women
 gyanayog bhaktiyog tathaa karmyog - teenon vachanakaron ko maanya hai kintu bhakthi par sabase adhik jor diya jaataa he
 Many of the followers of Vasava were Harijans and they also performed inter-caste marriages
 virashaivon kaa sampradaay 'shakti vishishtadvait' kehalaata he
 The Supreme Chaitanya or Supreme Agreement is beyond the country, time and other qualities
 para sanvid kii shakti hi is vishwa kaa utpaadak kaaran he
 The world or world is not false
 ek lambii or bahumukhi prakriya ke parinamswaroop bahurupadhari sansar kii utpatti hoti he
 What we see in humans is the development of specialization and self-consciousness, but this self-consciousness is the motivating reason for the attempt to reunite with the Supreme Consciousness
 sadhana ke parinaam swaroop jab ishwar kaa sachcha bhakt samadhi kii sarvocch sthiti ko praapt hota he tab summersaiky kii sthiti arthath ishwar ke prayek swaroop ke saath purna ekta kii sthiti utpann hoti he
 This is the state of bliss or salvation of man
 ise purna vilyan na maanakar milan ke paramanand main barabari se hissaa grahan karnaa samajhnaa adhik acha hoga
 Veerashaivas have established a tradition of spiritual discipline called 'shatasthala Shastra'
 yah maanav kii saadhaaran chetana kaa angsthal ke pratham prakram se lingsthal ke sarvocch kram par pahunch jane kii sthiti kaa suchak he
 In the whole process of spiritual practice, spiritual discipline, the emphasis is on devotion and refuge
 virshaiv mahatmaon kii kabhi kabhi 'sharan' yaa shivasharan kehete hai yane aise log jinhone shiv kii sharan main apane aapako arpit kar diya he
 His practice is called Shivayoga
 virashaivvaad mulat: advaitavaadi darshan he kintu yat: paramatma kriya or dhyaan se pare he or hamaare vaastavik anubhav kii duniya ke astitv kii vyakhya ichha tathaa kriya ke bina nahin kii ja sakati, isliye shiv ke shakti siddhant kii kalpana kii gai
 The spiritual aspirant uses one or all of his three powers to establish unity with God
 premashkti ke prayog kaa naam bhaktiyog, chintanashkti ke prayog kaa gyanayog tathaa karm shakti ke prayog kaa naam karmyog he
 It is through these that final unity with God is established
 isamen andeh nahin ki virashaivon ke bhi mandir, tirthasthan aadi vaise hi hote hai jaise anya sampradaayon ke, antar keval un devi devataaon main hota he jinaki puja kii jaati he
 As far as the relation of the Veerashaivas is concerned, the temples or other forms of cultivation are not as important as the idol of the favored linga, which is held on the body
 aadhyatmik guru prayek virshaiv ko isht ling arpit kar uske kaan main pavitra shadakshar mantra 'om nam: shivaay' phunk detaa he
 Each Veerashaiva bathes and worships with contemplation and meditation by placing the idol of the favored penis on the hand's gadali
 kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki prayek virshaiv main satyaparayanata, ahimsa, bandhutavbhaav jaise ucch naitik gunon ke hone kii aashaa kii jaati he
 He is indulgent and avoids alcoholic substances etc
 basav ne is sambandh main jo nidesh jari kiye the, unka saransh yah he - chori na karo, hatya na karo or na jhooth bolo, na apni prashansa karo na dusron kii ninda, apni patni ke sivaa anyash sab striyon ko mata ke samaan samajho
 The Vedas, the Upanishads and the Shaivagam are all in Sanskrit, so the Veerashaiva pledges added to the Kannada language and literature by incorporating their essence and the eternal elements into the Kannada language and literature
 duujhe ") chini bhashaa main janavaadee ganatantr china se chhapane vaali saamaanya dilchaspee kii ek patrika he

 amrapali ko lekar bhartiya bhashaaon main bahut se kavy, naatak or upanyaas likhe gaye hai
 He became a disciple under the influence of Ambapali Buddha and he valued the Buddhist Sangha with many donations

 It is said that Lord Tathagata also addressed him as "arya Amba" and received his hospitality

 Amrapali or Ambapali was born to unknown guardians around 600–500 BC, and was given her name because at the time of her birth they were said to have been born spontaneously on a mango tree in one of the royal gardens in Vaishali

 It is said that a feudal lord by the name of Mahamanman was so tempted that he left his kingdom and moved to Ambara village, a small village in Vaishali
 bhagwaan buddha rajgrih jate yaa lautate samay vaishali main rukate the jahaan ek baar unhone anbpali kaa bhi aatithy grahan kiya tha
 The description of the incidents which throw light on the life of Buddha in Buddhist texts is one of the famous and interesting incident of relation of Ambapali
 kehete hai, jab tathagat ek baar vaishali main tehre the tab jahaan unhone devataaon kii tarah deepyaman lichhavi raajputron kii bhojan ke liye prarthana asweekaar kar di, vahiin unhone ganika anbpali kii nishtha se prasann hokar uskaa aatithy sweekaar kiya
 By this, Garvini Ambapali shrugged those chariots and made her chariot equal to her chariot
 usne sangh ko aamon kaa apana bagichaa bhi daan kar diya tha jisase vah apana choumasa vahaan bitaa sake
 There is no doubt that Ambapali was a historical figure, though the miracles of the narrative make him extraordinary
 sambhavat vah abhijaat kulina thi or itani sundar thi ki lichchhaviyon kii parampara ke anusaar uske pita ko use sarvabhogya bananaa padaa
 He probably also spent a courtesan life and Bimbisara, the king of Magadha was probably among his benefactors
 bimbisar kaa usase ek putr hona bhi bataaya jaataa he
 However, later Amrapali became the exclusive worshiper of Buddha and his sangha, influenced by the teachings of Buddha and he accepted the life of Arhat by turning away from his life of sin

 Often the pressure of the floor of the water at the bottom of the inner and outer side of the well causes cracks in the soft and light earth; Therefore, the sand flows away and starts to rise to the height in the air like the bleeding sources, which gives an indication of the condition of the emission

 jai hind visheshrup se bharat main prachlit ek deshbhaktipurna naaraa he jo ki bhaashanon main tathaa samvaad main bharat ke prati deshbhakti prakat karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 It literally means "victory of India"
 yah naaraa bhartiya krantikari aabid hasan safraani dwaara diya gaya tha 
 Subsequently it became popular among Indians and was proclaimed by the leader Subhash Chandra Bose as a war Ghosh of the Azad Hind Fauj
 subhaashachandr bose ke anuyaayi tathaa noujvaan swatantrata senaanee gwallar, madhya bharat ke ramachandra moreshwar karkare ne tathyon par aadhaarit ek deshbhaktipurna naatak "jai hind" likhaa tathaa "jai hind" naamak ek hindi pustak prakashit kii
 After few years Ramchandra Karkare became the Congress President of Central Indian Provinces
 unhone prasiddh krantikari chandrasekhar aaazaad ke saath swatantrata sangram main hissaa liya
 The slogan 'jai Hind' is directly related to Netaji, but Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was not the first user
 aaiye dekhen yah kiske hriday main pehle pahal umada or aam bharatiyon ke liye jai-ghosh ban gaya
 The revolutionary 'chembakaraman Pillai', born with the slogan "jai Hind", was born on 15 September 1891 in Thiruvananthapuram
 gulaami ke aadi ho chuke deshavaasiyon main aazaadee kii aakanksha ke beej daalane ke liye unhone college ke dauraan “jai hind” ko abhivadan ke rup main prayog karnaa shuru kiya

 Indian soldiers were among the British soldiers imprisoned by Germany during World War II
 1941 main german kii qaidiyon kii chhavni main netaji ne inhe sambodhit kiya tathaa angrejo kaa paksh chhod aaazaad hind fouj main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit kiya
 When this news was published in newspapers, Abid Hussain, an Indian student living in German, left his studies and took up the post of secretary of Netaji
 aaazaad hind fouj ke sainik aapas main abhivadan kis bhartiya shabd se kare yah prashn saamne aayaa tab hossain ne”jai hind” kaa suzav diya
 After that on 2 November 1941, "jai-hind" became the war cry of the Azad Hind Fauj
 jaldi hi bharat bhar main yah goonjane laga, maatr congress par tab iskaa prabhaav nahin tha
 At an election meeting in 1946, when people were shouting slogans of "congress Jindabad", Nehruji asked people to raise the slogan "jai Hind"
 ab tak “vande-maataram” hi congress kii ahimsak ladaai kaa naaraa rahaa tha, 15 agast 1947 ko nehru ji ne aazaadee ke baad, laal kile se apane pehle bhaashan kaa samaapan, “jai hind” se kiya

 This seal continued till 31 December 1947

 These are called Faraday's laws of electrical decomposition

 These rules are presented in different ways in textbooks and scientific literature, but the prevalent form is something like this- vidyut apghaton main vidyutagron par jamaa hue padaarth kii maatra dhara kii maatra samaanupati hoti he
 'quantity of current' means charge and not electric current
 'dhara kii maatra' samaan hone par vidyutagron par jamaa / hathaaye gayi padaarth kii maatra us tatv ke tulyanki bhaar ke samaanupati hoti he
 In a nutshell, Faraday's rules can be written as follows - jahaan Notice that m / z is the equivalent weight of the deposited material
 farade ke pratham niyam ke liye, M, F, tathaa z niyat hai ; at: q jitna adhik hoga, utana hi adhik m bhi hoga
 For Faraday's second law, Q, F, and z are constants; Thus, the higher the m / z, the greater the m

 virechan siddhant dwaara arastu ne pratipaadit kiya ki kala or sahitya ke dwaara hamaare dooshit manovikaron kaa uchit rup se virechan ho jaataa he
 Successful tragedy evokes feelings of compassion and tragedy through ecstasy, harmonizing them and thus presenting Anand's role
 virechan se bhavatmak vishranti hi nahin hoti, bhavatmak parishkar bhi hota he
 In this way, Aristotle has proved art and poetry to be admirable, gracious and effortless
 arastu ne is siddhant ke dwaara kala or kavy kii mahatta ko punarpratishthit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya
 Aristotle's master Plato recommended that poets and artists be kept outside their ideal state
 unka maananaa tha ki kavy hamaari vaasanaon ko poshit karne or bhadakaane main sahaayak he isliye nindaneey or tyajya he
 Religious and high moral literature is an exception, but most of the literature does not fall under this ideal category
 virechan siddhanth kaa mahatva bahuvidh he
 The first is that he resolved the attack on Plato by poetry and secondly that he must have influenced the poetic thinking of the past in some form or the other
 'virechan' unani katharsis kaa hindi roopaantar he
 The definition of Greek medical science is 'catharsis' and the term of Indian medicine is 'virechan'
 iskaa arth he- rochak aushadhi ke dwaara shaareerik vikaron arthath udar ke vikaron kii shuddhi
 Just as the removal and purification of bodily feces is necessary for health, similarly the removal and purification of mental feces like jealousy, malice, greed, attachment and anger is necessary
 arestu ne ‘catharsis’ shabd kaa lakshanik prayog maanav-man par padanevaali traasadee ke prabhaav kaa udghaatan karne ke liye kiya he
 Plato's objection to the tragedy was - "instead of suppressing human desires, they nourish and nourish them
" vah ucchtar tattvon ke badale nimnatar tattvon ko ubharkar aatma main araajaktaa utpann karti he
 '' arestu ne catharsis siddhanth dwaara plato ke is akshep kaa khandanakar traasadee kii upadeyata sthapit kii
 Aristotle presented the same as a virtue to Plato who had proved the fault
 arestu kaa abhimath he- That is, tragedy is the name of a copy of a work involving a serious self-fulfilling and certain dimension
 


 jiske karunaa traas se udrek dwaara in manovikaron kaa uchit vivechan kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, tragedy does not only incite undesirable feelings, but expels human real-life compassion and feelings of tragedy through the artificial evocation of compassion and tragedy
 virechan kaa ullekh arestu kii rachanaaon main keval do sthanon par miltaa he
 The first is mentioned in his 'poetics' treatise, where the nature of Tragedy is indicated and the second in the book 'political' where he has demonstrated the usefulness of music
 in sthalon par unhone virechan shabd kaa sutara rup main evam uske swaroop kii charchaa kii he
 Aristotle says - "music should be studied not for one, but for the accomplishment of many purposes, that is, for instruction in education
" sangeet se bauddhik anand kii bhi uplabdhi hoti he
 xxrep 5 
 They become silent due to the influence of religious ragas, as if their charge is quenched and purgated
 is prakaar virechan se abhipraay shuddhi se he
 These ideas of Aristotle are found in retail form in the context of tragedy-deliberation
 vishesh suvyavasthitrup se inkaa sampaadan nahin kiya gaya he
 In the modern era, Aristotle's limited and meager words have taken the form of a complete poetic-classical theory
 atah ek prashn swaabhaavikrup se uthaa ki karunaa or traas ke udrek tathaa rechan se arestu kaa multah kya abhipraay tha? is sandarbh main arestu ke parvarti vyakhyakaaron ne virechan ke bhinn-bhinn arth or vyakhyaayein prastut kin- Among the Aristotle interpreters, Prof
 Gilbert Murray and Livy have presented a theological interpretation of the phrase
 dharmaparak arth kii ek vishesh prishthbhumi he
 It is related to religious festivals
 pro gilbert mare kaa kathan he ki - ‘‘yunaan main dionusus naamak devtaa se sambaddh utsav apane aap main ek prakaar kii shuddhi kaa pratik tha, jisamen vigat samay ke kalush or paap evam mrityu-sansargon se mukti mil jaati he
 Thus, this remedy of peace of internal disorders by external disorders was quite prevalent in religious institutions during Aristotle's time
 unhone iskaa lakshanik prayog usee ke aadhaar par kiya he or virechan kaa arth hua- ‘‘bahya uttejnaa or ant main uske shaman dwaara atmik shuddhi or shaanti
 '' barnej naamak german vidwaan ne virechan kii nitiparak vyakhya kii he
 According to him, the human mind is beset by many psychics
 jinamein karun or bhay, multah dukhad manoveg hai
 Tragedy overpowers the theater by unrealistic circumstances by exaggerating them with artificial ambiguous measures, resolving the nation of these emotions in the observer's mind as lust and consequently establishing mental harmony
 atah virechan kaa nitiparak arth hua - manovikaron ke uttejan ke uparant udvaig kaa shaman or tajjanya maansik vishadta
 Current psychology and psychoanalytic scriptures also confirm this meaning
 maansik swasthya kii sadhak hone ke kaaran yah paddati naitik maani gai he
 In Goethe and English poetical critics there are hints of the artistic meaning of the phrase
 arestu ke prasiddh vyakhyaakaar pro bujar kaa abhimath he ki virechan keval manovigyaan athwa nidaanshastra ke ek tathy vishesh kaa vaachak na hokar, ek kala-siddhanth kaa abhivyanjak he
 Thus, the duty of tragedy is not only to present a medium of expression for compassion or tragedy, but to provide them with a certain artistic satisfaction
 inako kala ke madhyam main dhalkar parishkrut or spasht karnaa he
 The meaning of purgation is broad here - mental balance is just the former part of it, the culmination of its artistic gratification without which the circle of artistic taste of tragedy is not complete
 prashn uthta he ki uparyukt teenon arthon main se koun sa arth arestu ke mat ke sarvaadhik nikat he? yadhyapi tatkaaleen dharmik paristhitiyon se arestu kaa prabhavit hona swaabhaavik he or swayan dharmik sangeet kii ore arestu ne sanket bhi kiya he ki jis prakaar dharmik sangeet shrotaaon ke bhaavon ko uttejit kar phir shant karata he, usee prakaar traasadee prekshak ke bhay ore karunaa ke bhaavon ko jagaakar baad main unhen upashmit karti he
 In relation to tragedy, this view is not literally correct, because the people who were cured by music were already emotional, whereas those who go to the auditorium are not in a mental state of compassion or fear
 atah virechan siddhanth kii prakalpana par ukt pratha kaa prabhaav apratyaksh to mana ja saktaa he; kintu sidhaa sambandh sthapit karnaa aavashyak he
 As far as ethical meaning is concerned, psychology also confirms this
 virechan se arestu ke taatpary bhaavon kaa nishkasana maatr nahin, varan unka santulan bhi he
 Similarly, the meaning of Prof
 Butcher is also worth considering
 unke anusaar virechan ke do paksh he- ek abhavatmak or doosraa bhavatmak
 The negative aspect is that he first stimulates the emotions, then after quenching them, he provides peace of mind
 iske baad sampann kalatmak parithosh uskaa bhavatmak paksh he
 It is not appropriate to give an emotional form to the phrase
 arestu kaa abhisht keval man kaa saamanjasy or tajjanya vimadta tak hi he, jiske aadhaar par vartmaan aalochak richards ne ‘antavritiyon ke samanjan’ kaa siddhanth pratipaadan kiya he
 Dr
 Nagendra is of the opinion that "the seeker of the art of taste is a must - the contemplated mind accepts the joy of art more quickly, but art of the taste is not an easy manifestation of art
" atev virechan siddhanth ko bhavatmak rup dena kadaachit nyaaysangat nahin he
 '' aadhunik vidwaanon ke matanusaar traas or karunaa kii bhavanaayen apane prakrut rup main adhik kshtprad banakar prakat hoti he
 As a result of the observation of tragedy, she publishes her affectionate and non-objectionable form
 is rup main ve nivaiyaktik evam saarvbhaum rup main saamne aati hai
 From this, the close relation of purgation and generalization can be easily seen
 yahan yah prashn uthta he ki kya traasadee ke prabhaav yaa prayojan ko samajhane ke liye virechan siddhanth hi ekmaatr samichin madhyam he? vastutah traasadee ke kaary ko rechan tak simit kar dena uske uddeshy ko sankeern banane jaisaa he
 In contrast, sentimental critics have tried to prove that the undesirable feelings also change and their excesses are erased by making the field of purgation extremely wide
 is vyapak drushtikon kaa pratipaadan dryden, edison aadi vidwaanon ne kiya
 Some scholars doubt the existence of the arbitration process
 unka akshep he ki vaastavik jivan main aisa virechan nahin hota he
 Karunadi becomes enlightened by tragedy, but her peace does not lead to complete peace of mind
 vastav main traasadee kaa chamatkaar multah ragaatmak hota he
 She enlightens emotions through the process of arbitration, adjusts them and thus presents the role of joy
 yah virechan siddhanth kii mahatvapurn dein he
 The second objection is that the parts displayed in the tragedy are unrealistic, so they are unable to enlighten our sentiments, no matter of arbitration
 vastutah yah mat bhi uchit nahin he
 Bhavodevak by tragedy is certainly not the result of art-miracle, but a culmination of a positive effect
 sarabhoot samanjankaree prabhaav hi uski safalataa kaa kaaran he
 Therefore, convulsions are completely neutral
 manovishleshan shaastra ke anusaar bhaawanaaon kii atrupti yaa daman maansik rogon kaa pramukh kaaran he
 They can be thought through proper expression and emotion of emotion
 achetan man main pade bhav uchit abhivyakti ke abhaav main maansik granthiyon ko janm dete hai
 By bringing these glands to conscious level, suffocation and insatiableness of the mind is removed
 isse man kaa tanaav dur ho jaataa he or chitt ek prakaar kii vishadta evam halkaapan anubhav karata he
 This process is the basis of the free thought-flow system of psychoanalytic science
 is drushti se virechan kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar sarvatha pusht he
 Scholars like Freud have presented Aristotle sentences in many places in support of their views
 arestu dwaara pratipaadit traasadee ke prabhaav kaa bhartiya kavyashastra main karun ras se paryaapt samya he
 The basic impulses of tragic impact are compassion and tragedy
 ye donon bhav multah dukhad hai
 On the other hand, the permanent feeling of Karun Rasa is 'mourning'
 bhartiya kavyashastra ‘shok’ sthaayee bhav ke antargat karunaa ke saath traas ke astitv ko sweekaar karata he
 Favored destruction or misery are the causes of mourning
 inase karunaa or traas donon kii udbhuti hoti he
 The tragedy is experienced by the compassion of the disaster, the fear of recurrence of the same disaster
 kintu bhartiya aacharyon or arestu ke drushtikon main pramukh antar yah he ki arestu kaa traasad prabhaav ek mishra bhav he, jabaki bhartiya kavyashastra kaa shok sthaayee bhav multah amishra he, jaise - sita ke durbhaagya se utpann karunaa main traas kaa sparsh nahin he, jabaki arestu kii drushti main traasahin karun prasang adarsh sthiti nahin he

 Natural farming is an environmental protection system established by Japanese farmer and philosopher Fukuoka

 Many scholars are of the opinion that the word 'tamil' derives from the Sanskrit 'dravid'

 In Magadhi Prakrit or Pali, the word 'dravid' became 'damilo'

 The word ‘dramil’ has come up in Shankaracharya’s physical commentary

 According to Tamil grammar, the form of the word Dramil is 'tirmid'
 aajkal kuch vidwaanon kii raay ho rahi he ki yah 'tiramid' shabd hi pracheen he jisase sanskritvaalon ne 'dravid' shabd bana liya
 a treatise on the word 'dravid' has been conceived in a treatise called 'shatrunjaya Mahatmya' of the Jains
 ukt pustak ke mat se aadi tirthakar rishabhdev ko 'dravid' naamak ek putr jis bhubhag main hua, uskaa naam 'dravid' pad gaya
 But it is known from ancient texts like India, Manushahita etc
 that the country was named Dravid because of the residence of the Dravidian caste
