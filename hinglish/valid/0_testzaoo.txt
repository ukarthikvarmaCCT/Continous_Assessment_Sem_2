 This scientific and methodical dictionary was originally composed in four sections

 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Acharya Ramchandra Varma also contributed best in this great work

 Later, between 1965–1976, its revised edition was published in 11 volumes

 In the editing of this Mahakosh with the consideration of means and circumstances, the masters of the assembly and the activists of the dictionary got great success
 isaki kuch uplabdhiyaan he jo stuty or abhinandaneey hai
 It can also be said that this Mahakosh was the staple and base of all the small and large shells of the Hidi, which became interchangeable with the Hindi word
 hindi koshkala ke labdhpratishth sampadak shri ramchandra verma ke is prashansaneey kaary kaa upjivy bhi mukhyatah hindi shabdhsagar hi he
 Its original form is mostly calculated from the literal form in the elemental form
 hindi ke anya koshon main bhi adhikansh saamagree isi kosh se lee gai he
 Like most of the earlier Hindi dictionaries, the Hindi word ocean was not created by one person but was created by many suddis penetrating language and literature

 a very mature appropriation of grammatical system and systematic instruction of words and meanings is seen in Hindi Shabdasagar

 Interpretation of the meanings from the idiom and proverbs of Hindi idioms and proverbs or the use of rituals is also sufficiently mature in this
 shabdhsagar main arthnirdhaaran main vyaakhyaatmak paddati apanaai gai he
 But at the same time more synonyms have been placed under the key words
 is kaaran kabhi kabhi aisa bhi lagata he ki yah kosh aadhunik dhang kaa paryaayavachi or nanarthak kosh ek saath ban gaya he
 Under the explanatory method, many types of introduction and description of the person, subject, object, etc
, mythological, historical, classical and traditional, are given in place
 is kaaran yah kosh vishwakosh, gyaanakosh, charitkosh or paribhaashik kosh ke parivesh kaa bhi yatra-tatra sparsh karata dekhai detaa he
 Some deficiencies can also be counted in this
 shabdon ke samast arthon kii prayogpushti or pramanikta ke nimit sarvatra udhaaharan nahin hai
 Wherever they are, nominal texts are often specified
 unek prasangsthal or sanskaran kaa ullekh nahin he
 Self-made examples of colloquialism have also been employed at many sites
 sab milakar isamen shabdasangrah or arthvivruti donon kii paridhi ko yathasambhav vyapak or vistrut banaaya gaya he
 In this area, the importance of this dictionary has increased greatly due to the combination of vocabulary stored with various professions and class life

 pali sahitya main mukhyat: buddha dharm ke sansthaapak bhagavan buddha ke upadeshon kaa sangrah he
 But some part of it was organized or written in Buddha's lifetime, it is difficult to say
 yadhyapi tripitak main hi kuch aise ullekh milte hai jinase buddha ke jeevankaal main hi dharm ke kuch prakarnon ke vyavasthit paath kiye jane kaa pataa chalata he
 For example, there is a description in Udaan that once God himself asked a monk named Sina, how did you understand religion? In response, the monk heard 16 octaves in full voice
 isaki bhagwaan ne prashansa bhi kii
 Vinayapitaka etc
 texts use adjectives such as Bahushruta, Dharmadhar, Vinayadhar, Matrikadhar and Panchannayik, Bhanak, Sutantik, which clearly shows that the tradition of Parana, holding of the teachings of the Buddha, had been in existence since his lifetime
 is parampara ke aadhaar par buddha ke upadeshon ko suvyavasthit saahitiyik rup dene ke liye teen baar sangeetiyaan kii jane ke ullekh chullavagg, dipavansh, mahavansh aadi granthon main milte hai
 The first association took place in the Rajgriha only four months after Buddha-nirvana in which 500 monks participated, due to which he is also famous as Panchashatika
 isaki adhyakshata mahakashyap ne kii or unhone buddha ke saakshaat shishy bhikshu upali se vinay sambandhi tathaa sthavir anand se sutt sambandhi prashn puch-poochkar anya bhikshuon ke anumodan se ukt vishyon kaa sangrah kiya
 The second such type of music took place in Vaishali 100 years after Buddha Nirvana, in which 700 monks joined and that is why she became known as Saptashtika
 isamen vaishali ke bhikshuon ke aacharan main anek dosha dikhaakar unhen vinay ke viruddh tehraaya gaya or anumaanath: vinayapitak main vishesh vyavastha laai gai
 According to Buddhaghosha, by the same association, the Buddha's words were classified into Tripitaka, five bodies, nine limbs and eighty-four thousand religious bodies

 In the meantime, Moggaliputta Tissas composed the Kathavatyu in which 18 misconceptions were dispensed with by Buddhist faiths
 is rachana ko bhi abhidhammpitak main sammilit kar liya gaya
 This music is not mentioned in Chullavagga nor in the literature of the Tibetan or Chinese Mahayana sect
 ashok ke bhabru ke lekh, jisamen saat prakarnon ke naam bhi uddhrut hai, usamen, athwa anya dharmalipiyon main aisi kisi sangeeti kaa kahin koi ullekh nahin kiya gaya
 For this reason, scholars such as Keith, Vallesar, etc
 have doubts about its historicity
 kintu riodevids, winternitz tathaa giger aadi vidwaanon ne isaki aitihaasikta sweekaar kii he
 The music, about which the ancient mentions and modern scholars are unanimous about the historicity, is the second musical of Vaishali
 in sangitiyon tathaa anya prayatnon ke falswaroop pali tripitak kaa jo swaroop praapt hua evam jis rup main vah hamen aaj uplabdh he, vah nimna prakaar he : The original Pali literature is divided into three parts, called Pitaka - "vinayapitaka", "sutpitaka" and "abhidhammapitaka"
 inamen se prayek pitak ke bheetar apane apane vishay se sambandh rakhanevaali anek choti badi rachanaaon kaa samavesh he
 These three pitas of Pali compile the thoughts and teachings of Lord Buddha in the pre-sixth century AD in a special style
 teenon pitakon main paraspar taratamya he
 The theme of the theme is Sutpitaka, in which a simple, interesting narrative style is adopted to make the teachings of God heartening to the audience
 yahan vastu ko sankshep main kehane kaa praytn nahin kiya gaya
 The aim is to make new things adaptable to the general audience and that is why the main part of the sermon has been repeated again and again
 prasangvash in sutton main tatkaaleen dharmik, saamaajik evam raajnneetik paristhitiyon kaa chithran bhi aa gaya he jo pracheen itihaas kii drushti se bada mahatvapurn he
 For example, the Buddhist contemporaries of the contemporary religions like Mankhaligosal, Pakudhikayan, Ajit Kes Kambali, Sanjay Balattiputt Niganthanatattu, etc
 and Buddhism of the religious sects promoted by them are found in Buddhist view in the Samphal Sutt, Brahmjala Sutta and Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Dighi Nikaya
 And at the same time, the rendering of Buddhist beliefs on those subjects is also found
 saamaajik chithran suttapitak main bikharaa padaa he, tathaapi khuddak nikaay ke antargat jaatakon main isaki prachur saamagree uplabdh he
 In the Sutas, the kings of the 16 districts of Magadha, Videha, Kosala, Kashi, etc
 of Buddha period are filled with mention of their interrelations and fighting and fights
 sutton ke upadeshon main jis buddha aachaar ke sanket paae jate hai, unheen kii bhikshuon ke yogya sadachaar ke niyamon ke rup main vidhi-nishedh-pranali se vyavastha vinay pitak main bhi kii gai he
 Likewise, the seeds of metaphysics embedded in sutas have been theoretically rendered in philosophical terms and interpreted in Abhidhamma Pitaka
 is paraspar aanushanbikta ke kaaran bauddhadharm kaa puraa sangopang evam suvyavasthit parigyaan bina tripitak ke avlokan ke nahin ho saktaa
 This Pali is based on the teachings of Lord Buddha himself from the point of view of Tripitaka
 uplabdh granth rachana kii drushti se i
 purv tritiy shatabdi se pashchaat kaa siddh nahin hota
 According to the Buddhist tradition, during the time of Ashoka emperor, his son Mahendra himself became a Buddhist monk and took this literature to Lanka and there he got the written form during the reign of King Battagamani in the first century AD which we find today
 tathaapi usamen aisi koi baat hamen nahin milti jo bich kii do teen shatabdiyon ke kaal main lanka kii paristhitiyon ke prabhaav ke kaaran usamen ai kahin ja sake
 The subject of the Vinayapitaka, according to his name, is to present the rules of virtuous morality of monks
 iske teen avaantar vibhaag hai - suttavibhang, khandhak or parivaar
 Suttavibhang again has two subdivisions - Mahavagga and Chullavagga
 is prakaar apane in upavibhaagon kii apeksha vinayapitak paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Sutapitaka is the most important part of Tripitaka in terms of its subject, detail and composition
 isamen aise sutton kaa sangrah kiya gaya he jo paramparanusaar yaa to swayan bhagwaan buddha ke kahe hue hai yaa unke saakshaat shishy dwaara updisht hai or jinka anumodan swayan bhagwaan buddha ne kiya he
 The Sanskrit formulation of Sutta is done
 kintu prastut sutton main sutara ke ve lakshan drushtigochar nahin hote jo sanskrit kii pracheen sutararachanaon, jaise vaidic sahitya ke shrout sutara, gruhm evam dharmasutra aadi main paae jate hai
 The special feature of the sutra is to convey more and more meanings in shortest words
 usamen punarukti kaa sarvatha abhaav avidhyman he
 But here, in contrast to the brief style, the style of elaborate lectures and repeated repetitions of key points has been adopted
 is kaaran sutt kaa sutara roopaantar uchit prathit nahin hota
 By considering, it is inferred that the meaning of the Sutta is originally from Sukta
 vedon ke ek ek prakaran ko bhi sookt hi kaha gaya he
 It is perfectly appropriate to call the rendering of one thing as Sukta
 suttapitak ke paanch bhaag hai jinhen nikaay kaha gaya hai - dighanikaay, majjhimanikaay, sanyuktanikaay, anguttaranikaay or khuddakanikaay
 The longevity is divided into three classes
 pratham silkkhandhavagg main 13 sutt hai, duusare mahavagg main 10 tathaa tisare patikavagg main 11
 Thus there are 34 suttas in longevity
 ye sutt anya nikaayon main sangruhit sutton kii apeksha vistaar main adhik lambey he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 Majjhimnikaya has 152 spans of moderate expansion divided into 15 sections - inamen se 14wein varg vibhang main 12 sutt hai or shesh sab main das-das
 There is a collection of all types of sutas in the Samyutanikayaya and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 isamen kul 56 sutt yaa sanyutt hai jo in paanch virgon main vibhajit hai - Anganwasa body has its own specialty
 isamen sutton kaa sangrah ek vyavastha ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 In the beginning there are such Sutras in which Buddha is a collection of precepts related to a numerical substance of God, followed by Sutras concerning two substances and then three, four etc
 isi kram se is nikaay ke bheetar ekakanipat, dukanipat evam tik, chatuvak, panchak, chakk, sattak, atthak, navak, dasak or ekadask in naamon ke gyaarah nipaton kaa sankalan he
 These drops are divided into reclasses, which are numbered 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 and 3
 is prakaar 11 nipaton main kul virgon kii sankhya 169 he
 There are many sutas within each class whose number is at least 7 and maximum 262 in one class
 is prakaar angutar nikaay se sutton kii sankhya 2308 he
 The Kundak body consists of 15 compositions, completely independent in terms of subject and composition, whose names are - pali tripitak ke tisare bhaag abhidhammpitak main bhagwaan buddha ke darshanatmak vichaaron kaa vishleshan or vargeekaran kiya gaya he tathaa tathvik drushti se unki suchiyaan or paribhaashaayen upasthit kii gai hai
 This Pitaka consists of the following seven texts - dhammsangani uski matika ke anusaar do bhaagon main vibhakt he
 The first part has 22 topics, in each of which three subjects are discussed
 duusare vibhaag main 100 duk hai or prayek duk main vidhaan ore nishedh rup se do do vishyon kaa prarupan kiya gaya he
 These shops are divided into 12 classes, namely - is prakaar dhammsangani ke tikon or dukon kii sankhya 122 he
 The first of these is the skilled, unskilled and uneducated theologian, which is the most important and its theme has been depicted in Chittupapad form Nyakshap and Atthadhar in these four scandals
 vibhang kii vishaywastu 18 vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 There are 216 q & A's within 23 chapters in Kathavatthu which contradict the doctrines of the opposing sects
 puggalpannati main 10 adhyay hai jinamein kramash: ek ek prakaar ke, do do prakaar ke aadi badhate kram main dasven adhyay main 10, 10 prakaar ke pudgalon arthath vyaktiyon kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 Individuals have been divided by separation, Samyak Sambuddha, each Buddha, Shayakshi, Ashakshiya, Arya, Anarya etc
 dhatukatha kii rachana kaa muladhar vibhang he, kyonki usee ke pratham teen arthath skandh, aaytan or dhaatu vibhangon kaa hi yahan adhik sookshm vivechan kiya gaya he
 For this reason, the second name of this book is also found in khamb-ayatan-dhatukatha
 granth main inhen teen kaa sambandh dharmon ke saath baitaakar bataaya gaya he
 According to Matik, these religions number 125 which are as follows - inkaa paraspar sambadh prashnottar kii style se 14 adhyyon main kiya gaya he
 Relation of religions in Yamak is explained in a contradictory style with particular subjects, and because of this couple's questionable manner, the Yamak name of this composition is meaningful
 jaise kya sabhi kushaldharm kushalmul hai? kya sabhi kushalmul kushaldharm hai? ityadi
 By this method, an attempt has been made to give a definite explanation of the terminology used in Abhidhammapitaka in Yamak
 yah rachana in 10 yamakon main vibhakt he - The basic ideology of Buddhist metaphysics has been discussed in great detail in a special style in the Puttana
 granth ke mukhya chaar bhaag hai - The relation of the 22 stanzas and the 24 suffixes of the 100 dukas referred to in Dhammasarini in these four parts is explained by the following six pieces: tik pak duk pak shop pik-dik pak-pik-dik pak and shops P
 in chah patthanon kaa purvawat chaar vibhaagon main prarupan hone se sampurna granth 24 patthanon main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The compilation of the above mentioned Tripitaka literature is often done in BC
 The third century was completed, but the creation of Pali literature continued even after that
 yadhyapi yah anupali sahitya vishay kii drushti se praaia: purnat: tripitak ke antargat gyaan kaa hi anukaran karata he, tathaapi apan swaroop evam style main samay kii gati ke anusaar usamen vikaas dikhaai detaa he
 BC Around the first century, a book called Nettpikaran was written in which the subject of Abhidhammapitaka has been discussed with some more precision
 isamen 16 haar, 5 nay or 18 mul padon ke dwaara buddha darshan kii paribhaashaon ko samajhane kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 The name of its doer is Kachchan
 isi prakaar kii ek duusari rachana isi kaal ke lagbhag kii petkopadesh he jisamen nettiprakaran kii hi vishaywastu ko kuch duusari reeti se upasthit kiya gaya he, jisamen pradhanta un chaar arya satyon kii he jo buddha ke upadeshon ke muladhar hai
 Often, the third composition of this period is milind-panho, which has its specialty in Pali literature and is also very important from historical point of view
 isamen sakal ke naresh milind or bhikshu nagsen se bich hua vaartalap varnit he
 Milind is considered to be a variation of the name of that Yavan Naresh Minadar, who b
c
 In the middle of the second century, India invaded and established its kingdom in the state of Punjab
 prastut granth ke anusaar yah raja bada vidvan or darshanik vishyon main ruchi rakhanevaala tha
 He posed many philosophical questions to the monk Nagasena, to which Nagsen has cleverly answered by affirming his beautiful illustrations
 granth main saat adhyay hai - Of these, the first three chapters are considered to be the original parts of the book
 shesh chaar adhyay peeche jode gaye prathit hote hai
 There are several reasons for this - one is the information about the restart of the book in the third chapter; Secondly, the incarnation of Buddhaghosha is usually taken from only three chapters and thirdly the Chinese translation of this book was done around 400 AD, only these three chapters are found in it
 yah rachana style main badi rochak tathaa buddha siddhant ke gyaan ke liye apane dhang kii adwitiya he
 After these compositions, the era of storytelling begins
 shrut paramparanusaar jab mahendra or sanghmitra dwaara pali tripitak lanka main pahunchaa or bauddhadharm kaa prachar badha, un mul granthon par sinhalai bhashaa main tikaa rup atthakathaayen likhi gai
 These fables are no longer available
 anumaanath: iskaa kaaran un atthakathaon kii rachana ho jane se kramash: un mul atthakathaon kaa adhyayan adhyaapan chhot janaa hi he
 The name of Acharya Buddhaghosha, the author of these new Pali chronicles, is very famous in Pali literature
 unhone jin sinhalai atthakathaon kaa ullekh kiya he tathaa jinke avataran apni atthakathaon main liye hai, unamem mukhya hai- The last four chronicles appear as special lectures on bodies or any of their subjects
 in mul atthakathaon ke abhaav main yah kahana to kathin he ki kitne ansh main buddhaghosh ne unka anukaran kiya or kitna moulik rup se kiya, tathaapi unki rachanaaon ko dekhne se spasht prathit hota he ki unhone mul atthakathaon ko apane tripitak ke vishaal gyaan dwaara bahut hi pallavit kiya hoga
 His chronicles are found on most parts of Vinayapitaka, Sutpitaka and Abhidhammapitaka, numbering 16
 in atthakathaon ke atirikt buddhaghosh kii ek vishisht rachana he visuddhimagg, jise buddha darshan kaa gyaanakosh kaha ja saktaa he
 According to Buddhaghosa himself in the eight stories, he has filled the essence of these four bodies in Visuddhimagga, Digha, Majjhim, Samyutta and Angusad
 shrut paramparanusaar unhone visuddhimagg ko apni atthakathaon se purv unki rachana ko apni yogyata siddh karne ke liye hi likhaa tha
 There are a total of 23 passages in this book
 pratham do parichchhedon kaa vishay he "samadhi" or shesh parichchhedon main "pragna" kaa vyaakhyaan kiya gaya he
 After Buddhaghosha, the tradition of storytelling was reaffirmed by his two contemporary scholars, Buddhadutt and Dhammapala
 buddhadutt ne buddhaghosh krit samantapasadika naamak vinayapitak kii atthkatha kaa saar apni uttaravinishchay or vinayavinishchay naamak do padyatmak rachanaaon main upasthit kiya tathaa buddhaghosh kii abhidhamm kii atthakathaon ke aadhaar par abhidhammavatar naamak gadhy-padya-mishrit granth kii rachana kii
 The originality in this is that where Buddhaghosha has discussed religions through the five wings of Rupa, Vedanadi, Buddhadatta has adopted this four types of classification as Chittar, Chetasik, Rupa and Nirvana
 isi vargeekaran ko unhone apni rooparoop vibhaag naamak rachana main rakhaa he
 Another creation of Buddhadutt is Madhurutha Vilasini, a story of Buddhavans
 dhammpal ne saat atthakathaayen likhi he
 Buddhaghosha did not write anecdotes on the texts named Uddan, Itishutak, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Theragatha, Therigatha and Chariapitaka under Khuddakanikaya, on which Dhammapala has written an anthology called Paramatthadipani
 isi prakaar nettiprakaran par atthasanvaneena or usee par linatthavannana naamak tikaa, visuddhimagg par paramatthamanjusha, buddhaghosh kii chaar nikaayon kii atthakathaon par leenatthapakasini naamak tikaa, jatakatthakatha kii tikaa tathaa buddhadutt krit madhuratthvilasini kii tikaa likhi
 The most famous of these works is his commentary
 shesh rachanaaon main koi vaishishty nahin he
 Although the above is not after the creation of Tripitaka and his stories
 yadhyapi ukt tripitak va unki atthakathaon kii rachana ke pashchaat buddhavachan ke sambandh main adhik kuch kahana shesh nahin rahaa, tathaapi is atthkatha naamak tikaa sahitya kii rachana buddhaghosh yug main baraabar hoti rahi
 Some of these compositions are as follows: anandakrit abhidhamm mul tikaa, chulldhammpal krit 'sachch sankshep', upsen krit saddhammppajotik mahanam krit sadshammppakasini, kassap krit mahvichedni or vimatichhedni, vajrabuddhi krit sammtavpasadika kii tikaa, kshem krit khemppkaran, aniruddh krit abhidhammaththsangaho paramatthavinishchay or namrupapariched, dharmashri krit khuddakasikkha or mahaswami krit mulsikkha
 From 12th century onwards, the creation of commentaries started in Magadhi language itself
 is kaary kii suvyavastha ke liye lanka naresh parakrambahu pratham ke kaal main sinhalai sthavir mahakssap dwaara ek sangeeti kii gai, jiske falswaroop samantapasadika aadi atthakathaon par deepani, manjusa, pakasini aadi naamon se aath tikaayen likhi gayi, jinamein se ab keval vinayapitak kii samantapasadika atthkatha par likhi gai saratthdipani tikaa maatr milti he
 Three other commentaries of its subject Sariputta are also found
 sumangala, saddhammajotipal, dhammakirti, buddharavikhat or meghankar - in sabhi ne bhinn-bhinn atthakathaon par tikaayen likhi he
 In these, ten commentary texts like the original Sikha Tika of Wachissar Ther alone are found
 13veen shatee main sthavir videh, buddhapriy or dharmakirti dwaara samantakutavannana aadi anek granthon kii rachana hui
 Four poetic texts are famous among the works of the 14th century - baad kii teen rachanaaon ke kartaaon ke naam agyaat hai
 After the 14th century, the field of Pali-literature-creation rose from Lanka and reached Brahmadesh
 yahan ke sahityakaron ne abhidhamm ko vishesh rup se adhyayan kaa vishay banaaya
 Some compositions of the 15th century are 16veen shatee main saddhammalankar ne patthan prakaran par patthandipani naamak tikaa likhi tathaa mahanam se anandakrit abhidhamm-mul-tikaa par madhusaaraty dipani naamak anutika likhi
 In the 17th century, Tripitakalankar composed the three texts on the eightyasalini, Visastivanna, the commentary on the Sariputitika Vinayasagraha called Vinayalankara and Yasavaddhanavatthu
 trilokguru ne chaar granth rache- The other two compositions of this Shati are the Dhatukthayajana by Saradassi and Abhidhammatthaganthipada by Mahakasap
 18veen shatee kii gnanamivanshnamak brahmdes ke sangharaaj kii teen rachanaayen prasiddh hai- Some of the creations of the 19th century Brahmadesh- Nalatdhatu Vans, Sandes Katha Boundedism, decision etc
 is shatee ke chhakesadhatuvans, gandhavans or sasanavans naamak rachanaaon kaa parichay vans sahitya ke antargat diya gaya he
 Other notable works of this century are the monk Ledisdav's Abhidhammamsarah's Paratthadipani Tika and the Pali essay on Yamak which he wrote to address some of Mrs Raise Davids's doubts
 pali-sahitya-rachana kii avichhinn dhara ke pramanswaroop 20veen shatee kii do rachanaaon kaa ullekh karnaa anuchit na hoga
 These are Visuddhimagdipika composed by Bhandat Dharmanand Kosambi and Navneet Tika of Abhidhammatthasangra in India
 is parichay ke aadhaar se kaha ja saktaa he ki paalisahitya-nirmaan kii dhara dhai hajaar varsh ke pashchaat bhi abhi tak vicchhinn nahin hui
 At the time when Tripitaka was being composed in Sri Lanka, historical interest in some of the writers was aroused at the same time, resulting in the creation of Deepavansha
 in granthon main lanka kaa itihaas, pracheenatam kaal se lekar raja mahasen ke rajyakaal tak, varnan kiya gaya he
 This work has been used by Buddhaghosha abundantly in his books and has also given its revision in some places
 is prakaar dipawans kaa rachanakaal i
 chauthi paanchavin shatee ke bich siddh hota he
 Along with the kings of Sinhala, the details of the life of Buddha, the tradition of his disciples and all the three musicians etc
 have been exaggerated
 anumaanath: iske vishay kaa aadhaar uparyukt sinhalai atthakathaayen rahi hai
 This composition is poly-prose-mixed, the style is very relaxed, the repetitions are also many and the composition is not free from defects of language, verses etc
 ye lakshan uski pracheenta ke dyotak hai or is baat ke pramaan hai ki usamen vishaywastu anek sroton se sankalit kii gai he tathaa usamen sampadakeey vyavastha laane kaa koi vishesh praytn nahin kiya gaya
 But historically in Lanka, it has a great respect from the beginning
 kaha jaataa he ki i
 5veen shatee main hi sinhal raja dhatusen ne ek varshikotsav ke avasar par rashtriya gaurav ke saath iskaa paath karaayaa
 Deepavans is naturally the oldest work in Indian historical works
 dipavansh kii rachana se kuch kaal pashchaat mahanam ke dwaara mahavansh kii rachana hui
 Its base is also the Sinhala story and the deep dynasty
 yahan vishay kaa pratipaadan dipavansh kii apeksha adhik vishad or vyavasthit he
 Language is also more refined and the style reminds us of the method of epics somewhere
 mahavansh kaa mul bhaag 37 parichchhedon kaa he or vah dipavansh ke samaan mahasen ke shasankaal par samaapt hota he
 The earliest passages, which mention the religious conditions of the country before the arrival of Buddhism in Lanka, are historically significant
 udaahranarth, pandaskamay naresh kaa rajyakaal mahendra dwaara lanka main bauddhadharm ke pravesh se 60 varsh purv tak rahaa kaha gaya he
 This king ruled for 70 years and established the city of Anuradhapura only in the 10th year of the state
 isse aage is rachana main samay-samay par parivardhan kiya gaya he
 From the 50th saga of the 37th passage to the 79th passage, the composition is Sthir Dharmakirti and gives the lineage of 78 kings from the time of Mahasena to Parakramabahu I
 mahavansh kaa yah tathaa isse aage ke pariched chulvansh kehalaata he
 The Buddhist monk, the author of 11 passages from Chulvansh 80 to 90, described the next 23 kings who came to Parakramabahu IV
 91 se 100 tak ke 10 pariched sumangala ther dwaara rache gaye or unamem bhuvnekbahu tritiy se lekar kirtishree rajsingh ke kaal tak ke 24 raajaaon kaa varnan kiya
 The propagation of Christianity in Lanka is also reported here
 aglaa 101vaan pariched sumangalacharya tathaa devarakshit dwaara rachaa gaya
 Thereafter, there is also information about the state going into the hands of the British
 mahavansh kaa antim parivadharn bhikshu pragyanand nayak dwaara 1936 main prakashit hua or isamen 1815 se 1935 i
 tak kaa lanka kaa itihaas samavisht kiya gaya he
 Thus the composition of the Mahavansha has the hand of six authors by whom the history of Lanka from Lord Buddha to about two and a half thousand years has been inscribed unceasingly
 yah granth is baat kaa bhi pratik he ki ukt deergh kaal tak lanka main pali bhashaa ko kis prakaar jivit rakhaa gaya or usamen saahitiyik rachana kii dhara ko kabhi sookhne nahin diya gaya
 Deep Vansh and Mahavansha creations awakened intense historical instincts
 parinamat: anek anya vansh naamak granth rache gaye
 Historical facts are often taken from both the above mentioned texts, but the tradition of the various themes which have been collected in them is important
 inamen vishay ko mahatv dene ke liye bahut kuch atishyoktiyon or kalpanaaon kaa bhi aashray liya gaya he, jiske kaaran kahin kahin itihasajna ko udvaig yaa ashraddha utpann hone lagati he
 The main compositions of this type are - ukt granthon main adhikansh bhaag pracheen tripitak, unki atthakathaon tathaa mahavansh ke antargat vaarta kii sakshep yaa vistaar se punrariti maatr he
 But still they have some originality of their own subject, on the basis of which we get some history of the above mentioned subjects from the Buddha period till now
 yah pali sahitya kii apni visheshta he jo sanskrit praakrit main nahin pai jaati
 Classical texts have also been composed in Pali from time to time
 vyakaran ke kshetra main kacchan or moggallan krit, vyakaran evam unki tikaayen prasiddh hai
 In 1154 AD, there is a grammar of Pali language based on the grammar of Kachchan, Saddaniti, monk of Brahmadesh
 iske teen bhaag hai- padmala, dhatumala or suttamala
 Based on this, there is a rhymed metallist called Dhatvarthadeepani, a Jinratna monk
 pali vyakaran vishyak anya kuch rachanaayen hai- saddhammaguru krit saddabutti, mangalakrut gandhatthee or samner dhammadassi krit vachhvachak, arievansh krit gandhabharan, brahmadesh ke narsh kychha kii putree krit vibhaktyarthprakaran, jambudhvaj krit sanvaneenanay-dipana or niruttisangah, raajaguru krit karkpupfamanjari 
 The "abhidhanappadipika" and "ekkkara Kosh" of the Pali are well-known books
 pali chand:shaastra par bhi anek rachanaayen hai, jaise vrittoday, chandovichiti or kavibharprakaran aadi
 Among them, the most famous is the Thar Sangharvikrita

 The Prime Ministers also ultimately appoint and expel Union Ministers
 haalaanki, mantriyon kii niyukti, nishkasana va anya aise kaary pradhanmantri swayan nahin kar sakate he
 The appointment and removal of ministers is done by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister
 bhartiya samvidhan kramshah aise kai vidhaan preshit karata he, jinke dwaara vaidhik rup se yah sunishchit kiya gaya he ki saamaanya halaaton main, karypalika ke maamle main raashtrapati par keval nammaatr shaktiyaan nihit hon, jabaki vaastavik shaktiyaan pradhanmantri ke haathon main ho
 The powers of the Prime Minister and the President have been mentioned in the various Articles of Part 5 in the Constitution as follows: saadharantah, pradhanmantri ko sansadeey aam chunaav ke parinaam ke aadhaar par raashtrapati dwaara niyukt kiya jaataa he
 The Prime Minister is the leader of the majority-party in the Lok Sabha
 haalaanki, pradhanmantri kaa swayan loksabhaa saansad hona anivaary nahin he parantu unhen loksabhaa main bahumat siddh karnaa hota he or niyukti ke chah maheenon ke bheetar hi sansad kaa sadsy bananaa padataa he
 The Prime Minister can be a member of either of the two houses of Parliament
 aitihaasik taur par aise kai pradhanmantri hue hai, joki rajyasabha -saansad the; 1966 main indira gandhi, devgauda or haal hi main manmohan singh, rajyasabha-saansad the
 After each election, after the election of the leader of the majority of the pulses in the meeting of the new assembly, the President invites the leader of the majority party to become the Prime Minister, after accepting the invitation, the person concerned receives a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha it happens
 tatpashchaat vishwasamat-prapti kii aadesh ko raashtrapati tak pahunchaaya jaataa he, jiske baad ek samaaroh main pradhanmantri tathaa anya mantriyon ko pad kii shapath dilaai jaati he or unhen pradhanmantri niyukt kiya jaataa he
 If any one party or coalition is unable to obtain a majority in the Lok Sabha, then it is entirely up to the discretion of His Excellency the President to decide who to invite to get the Prime Minister
 aisi sthiti ko trishanku sabha kii sthiti kaha jaataa he
 In the event of a hung assembly, the President usually invites the leader of the largest party to prove his majority in the following
 nimantran sweekaar karne vaale vyakti kaa loksabhaa main vishwasamat siddh karnaa anivaary he or uske baad hi vah vyakti pradhanmantri niyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 Historically, various presidents have used this privilege on several occasions
 varsh 1977 main raashtrapati neelam sanjeev reddy ne pradhanmantri morarji desai ke istife ke pashchaat, choudhary charan singh ko isi visheshadhikaar kaa prayog kar, pradhanmantri niyukt kiya tha
 Also, using this privilege, the Presidents have appointed Rajiv Gandhi and Vishwanath Pratap Singh in 1989, Narasimha Rao in 1991 and Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1996 and 1998 to appoint the Prime Minister
 cabinet, pradhanmantri dwaara chaynit or raashtrapati dwaara niyukt mantriyon se bana hota he
 The Constitution of India does not specify any special qualifications for the post of Prime Minister
 parantu ek aavashyakta zarur nirdhaarit kii gai he: pradhanmantri ke paas loksabhaa athwa rajyasabha kii sadsyta honi chahie, or unke paas loksabhaa main bahumat kaa samarthan hona chaiye
 If at the time of appointment, the eligible person is not a member of either of the two houses of the Indian Parliament, then it is mandatory for him to get the membership of Parliament within 6 months of the appointment otherwise his prime ministership will be rejected
 atah pradhanmantritv ke daavedaar ke paas, ek saansad hone kii sari arhataayen hona chaiye
 The 84th Article of the Fifth Part of the Indian Constitution specifies the qualifications of an MP, according to: koi vyakti sansad ke kisi sthaan ko bharne ke liye chune jane ke liye arhit tabhi hoga jab— As specified in the third point, the eligible will have to live up to any eligibility of eligibility passed by the Parliament in future and since the Prime Minister is mandatory to be an MP, the Prime Minister's eligible to be eligible to be a member of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, some other Qualifications also have to be met, including a person with a distorted character or not being declared insolvent, voluntarily
 To obtain citizenship of a foreign state, including to have the election declared void by a court, and be appointed by the President or Governor
 saath hi, paatr kaa, kendriya sarkaar, kisi bhi rajya sarkaar athwa purvakthith kisi bhi sarkaar ke adheen kisi bhi karyaalay tathaa prashasnic yaa gaiyr-prashasnic nikaay kii seva main kisi bhi laabhakaari pad kaa karmchaaree nahin hona chahie
 Also, the membership of the eligible is also terminated by the motion-approved expulsion from the House
 niyukti ke pashchaat, inamen se, purvakthith kisi bhi arhataaon par, pradhanmantri kii ayogyata, kisi vidhik nyaayalay main siddh kii jaati he, to, us vyakti kaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya jaataa he, or use pradhanmantri ke pad se nishkasit kar diya jaataa he
 The oath of office to the Prime Minister is administered by the President
 pad par niyukti hetu, bhavi padaadhikari ko do shapath lene kii anivaaryta he
 Both these oaths are specified in the Third Schedule of the Indian Constitution, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 and 219): shapath yaa pratigyaan ke praroop: Format of 1 Ministerial Oath: 2 gopneeyata kii shapath kaa praroop : In principle, the incumbent Prime Minister, "president of the Presidency", holds office
 raashtrapatipad ke vipareet, pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal ke liye koi kaal-seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he
 Therefore, a sitting Prime Minister can remain on the Prime Minister indefinitely, provided that the President has "confidence" in him
 iskaa vaastavik arth yah he kii ek vyakti keval tab tak pradhanmantri pad par bana rah saktaa he, jabatak loksabhaa main bahumat kaa vishwash uske paksh main he
 However, the full term of the Lok Sabha is 5 years, after which new elections are held, and the new assembly again passes a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister, if the newly elected assembly declares a distrust in the Prime Minister, then the term of the Prime Minister ends
 it happens
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki pradhanmantri kaa ek puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh kaa hota he, jiske baad uski punahsamiksha hoti he
 However, the term of the Prime Minister can be terminated before 5 years, if due to any reason, pass a no-confidence vote against the Lok Sabha Government or if for any reason, the Prime Minister's membership of the Parliament is declared void, the Prime Minister may, at any time, The resignation of office can be done by handing over a written resignation to the President
 pradhanmantri morarji desai desh ke pehle pradhanmantri the, jinhone kaarykaal ke bich apana pad tyaag diya tha
 There is no time limit on the tenure of the Prime Minister nor any age limit has been specified
 bharat praveshdwar Article 74 of the Constitution of India expressly requires the presence of the Prime Minister to preside over and run the Council of Ministers
 uski mrityu yaa tyaagptr kii dasha me samast parishad ko pad chhodna pasta he
 He alone constitutes the Council of Ministers
 raashtrapati mantrigan kii niyukti uski salaah se hi karte hai
 The Department of Minister's Department also determines the same
 cabinet ke kaary kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 He also gives instructions to the administration of the country
 sabhi nitigat nirnay vahi letaa he
 The link between the President and the Council of Ministers is also the same
 mantriparishad kaa pradhan pravaktaa bhi vahi he
 He leads parliamentary debates in the name of the council
 sansad me parishad ke paksh me ladi ja rahi kisi bhi bahes me vah bhaag le saktaa he
 The coordination between the minister also does the same
 vah kisi bhi mantralay se koi bhi soochna mangava saktaa he
 Due to all these reasons, the Prime Minister is considered the most important political personality of India
 bhartiya pradhanmantripad ke varchasv va mahatv kaa sabase ahm kaaran he, uske padaadhikari ko pradaan kii gai kaaryakari shaktiyaan
 Article 74 of the Constitution establishes the office of Prime Minister, and specifies that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the head, who shall provide "advice and assistance" to the President of India
 tathaa anuchhed 75 yah sthapit karata he keemntriyon kii niyukti, raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar kii jaayegi, evam mantri ko vibhinn kaarybhaar bhi raashtrapati, pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar hi denge
 Therefore, the constitution specifies that where the President of India has constitutional executive authority, but because the President of India only acts in favor of the Prime Minister in these relations, in reality, the Prime Minister exercises these executive powers as he wishes
 
 in vidhaanon dwaara samvidhan yah sthapit karata he, kii bharat ke rashtrapramukh hone ke naate, raashtrapati par nihit saare kaaryakari adhikaar, apratyaksh rup se, pradhanmantri hi kiya karenge, tathaa sampurna mantriparishad ke pradhan honge tathaa anuchhed 75 dwaara mantriparishad kaa gathan, mantriyon kii niyukti evam unka kaarybhaar saunpna bhi pradhanmantri kii ichha par chhod diya gaya he, balki mantriyon or mantralayon ke sambandh main samvidhan, pradhanmantri ko puri khuli chhot pradaan karata he
 The Prime Minister can include, remove, appoint or suspend any person in his cabinet
 kyonki mantriyon kii niyukti raashtrapati dwaara keval pradhanmantri kii salaah par hoti he, atah iskaa arth yah he kii kendriya mantriparishad vaastavik rup se pradhanmantri kii pasand ke logon dwaara nirmit hoti he, jisamen ve apni pasandanusaar kabhi bhi pher-badal kar sakate he
 At the same time, giving various duties to ministers also depends entirely on the will of the Prime Minister; She can assign any ministry or assignment to any of her ministers, take away or assign any other charge / ministry
 in maamlo main sambandhit mantriyon se salaah-mashwara karne kii, yaa unki anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii koi sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 Rather, there is no constitutional obligation of any kind on the Prime Minister to obtain the advice or permission of the Minister or Ministers concerned in any of the foregoing matters regarding Ministers and Ministries
 ve kabhi bhi apni icchaanusaar, kisi bhi mantri ko mantripad se istifa dene ke liye bhi kah sakate he, or yadi vah mantri, istifa dene se inkaar kar detaa he, to ve raashtrapati se kah kar use pad se nilambit bhi karvaa sakate hai
 Apart from the appointment of ministers and allocation of ministries, the Prime Minister also has full control over the cabinet meetings, the activities of the cabinet and the policies of the government
 pradhanmantri, mantriparishad ke sanvaidhanik pramukh evam netaa hote hai
 He represents the Council of Ministers in Parliament and other forums
 ve mantrimandaleey sabhaaon kii adhyakshata karte hai, tathaa in baithkon kii kaarysoochee, tathaa charchaa ke anya vishay wo hi tay karte hai
 Rather, all matters and content that arise in cabinet meetings are determined with the approval and consent of the Prime Minister
 cabinet kii baithkon main uthne vaale vibhinn prastaavon ko manzur yaa naamanzur karnaa, pradhanmantri kii ichha par hota he
 Although every Minister is at liberty to discuss and put his personal suggestions and proposals before the meeting, but ultimately the same proposal or decision is taken which is agreed upon by the Prime Minister and after the decision is passed, the final decision of the entire Council of Ministers
 Supposedly, and all ministers have to follow up with that decision of the Prime Minister
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he kii sanvaidhanik rupatah, kendriya mantrimandal par pradhanmantri ko purna niyantran va chunautihin prabhutv hasil he
 In the matter of control, the Prime Minister is the surveyor of the Council of Ministers, and with his resignation, the entire government collapses, meaning that all ministers lose their ministership
 mantriparishad kii adhyakshata ke alaava samvidhan, pradhanmantri par ek or khaas visheshadhikaar nihit karata he, yah visheshadhikaar he mantriparishad or raashtrapati ke bich kaa madhyasampark sutara hona
 This privilege is only given to the Prime Minister, through which the Prime Minister, from time to time, keeps the President notified of the information related to decisions and discussions to be taken in the Council of Ministers
 pradhanmantri ke alaava koi bhi anya mantri, swechha se mantrisabha main charchit kisi bhi vishay ko raashtrapati ke samaksh udghaatit nahin kar saktaa he
 The importance and meaning of this privilege is that the Prime Minister also has the right to decide which of the topics discussed in the cabinet meetings is to be kept confidential, and which information should be presented to the world
 pradhanmantri, rajya ke vibhinn angon ke mukhya prabandhak ke rup main kaary karte he, jiskaa kaary, rajya ke saare vibhaagon va angon se, apni icchaanusaar kaary karwaanaa he
 They also have to coordinate between different departments and ministries of the government, and implement decisions taken by the cabinet and direct various departments
 mantralayon or vibhaagon ke bich ke prashasnic matbhed sulajhana or antim nirnay lenaa bhi unka kaam he
 In addition to the implementation of government functions, the Prime Minister has a great influence and hold over the government machinery
 shashan va sarkaar ke pramukh hone ke naate, kaaryakarini kii tamaam niyuktiyaan vaastavik taurapar pradhanmantri dwaara kii jaati he
 All high-level officers and officials appoint the Prime Minister of their choice
 in niyuktiyon main, ucch-salaahkaaron tathaa sarkari mantralayon or karyaalayon ke ucchadhikari samet, vibhinn rajyon ke rajyapal, mahanyaywaadee, mahalekhapareekshak, lok seva ayog ke adhipati, va anya sadsy, vibhinn deshon ke rajdoot, vaanijyadoot ityadi, sab shaamil hai
 All these high level appointments are made by the President of India, on the advice of the Prime Minister
 sarkaar or mantriparishad ke pramukh hone ke naate, pradhanmantri loksabhaa main bahumat or sattapaksh ke netaa or pramukh pratinidhi hai
 In this context, it is considered the duty of the Prime Minister to represent the government and the ruling party in the House
 saath hi yah aashaa kii jaati he ki sadan main sarkaar dwaara liye gaye mahatvapurn vidheyak or ghoshnaayen pradhanmantri karenge tathaa un mahatvapurn nirnyon ke vishay main sattapaksh kii taraf se pradhanmantri uttar denge
 The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by election, so generally, the Speaker also has a majority of pulses
 atah, bahumat daal ke netaa hone ke naate, sabhapati ke zariye, pradhanmantri, loksabhaa kii karrwai ko bhi simitroop se prabhavit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai, kyonki sabhapati, sabha kaa adhishthata hota he, or sadan main charchaa kii vishaysoochee bhi sabhapati hi nirdhaarit karata he, haalaanki sadan kii karrwai ko adhik had tak prabhavit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from these duties, the Prime Minister has the most important power over parliamentary action, the power to convene and end the Lok Sabha session
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 85, loksabhaa ke satr bulaane or satrant karne kaa adhikaar, bharat ke raashtrapati ko detaa he, parantu is maamle raashtrapati ko pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar kaary karnaa padataa he
 That is to say, it is in the hands of the Prime Minister to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha
 yah adhikaar, nihsandeh, pradhanmantri ke haathon main di gayi sabase mahatvapurn adhikaar he, joki unako na keval apane dal par, balki vipaksh ke saansadon kii gatividhiyon par bhi simit niyantran kaa avasar pradaan karata he
 Being the leader of the government and the country, representing India on the global stage is one of the prime minister's most important responsibilities
 sarkaar or mantriparishad par apni apaar niyantran ke kaaran, bhartiya rajya kii vaishvik niti nirdhaarit karne main pradhanmantri kii sabase ahm bhoomika hoti he
 Decisions related to the country's foreign policy, according to the country's strategic, diplomatic, economic, commercial, etc
 requirements, are usually determined by discussion in the Council of Ministers, in which the Prime Minister takes the final decision
 vaishvik sambandhon or unase jude maamalon bharat kaa videsh mantralay sambhalata he, jiske liye videsh mantri ke naam se ek swatantra cabinet mantri bhi niyukt kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu kyonki videsh nitiyaan, ityadi, pradhanmantri nidhaarit karte hai, atah, videsh mantri antytah pradhanmantri dwaara liye gaye nirnyon or nitiyon ko karyanvit karne kaa kaam karata he
 The Prime Minister's role is most important in strategic, economic, diplomatic, commercial and resource, etc
 treaties and agreements, and diplomatic debates and negotiations involving various countries, and in such negotiations they represent the country
 vibhinn deshon ke ke rashtradhyakshon va pratinidhimandalon kaa swaagat-satkar karnaa va unki mejabani karnaa bhi pradhanmantri kii zimmedaar hoti he
 Apart from hosting foreign delegates, the Prime Minister, being the representative and head of government, also represents India abroad
 ve sanyukt raashtra sangh, ji-20, bricks, saarc, gut nirpeksh andolan, rashtramandal, ityadi jaise antarrashtriya sanghathanon main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, or bharat kaa paksh rakhte hai
 The Prime Minister's position is important in building the country's image on the international stage, and in supplying the country's interest through diplomatic negotiations
 bhartiya samvidhan, rashtrapramukh or sarv samrik balon ke adhipati hone ke naate, kisi anya desh se yuddh va shanti ghoshit karne kaa adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ko detaa he, parantu iskaa vaastavik adhikaar pradhanmantri ko he, kyonki raashtrapati is maamle main pradhanmantri kii salaah ke anusaar kaary karne hetu baadhya hai
 Apart from the declaration of war, it is the Prime Minister to determine the strategy of war and control the strategic forces, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister to declare peace and to compromise peace
 bharat sarkaar ke kuch vishesh, samvedansheel evam ucchstareey vibhaag va mantralay aise hai, jinaki visheshta, samvedansheeltaa yaa anya kisi karanvash pradhanmantri ke alaava anya kisi bhi mantri ko inkaa kaarybhaar nahin saunpa jaataa he
 They are accountable to the Parliament for the work of these various departments, and they have to answer the questions asked in Parliament when required
 aam taurapar, pradhanmantri in nimnlikhit vibhaagon ke prabharee hote hai: In view of the political importance of the Prime Minister of India and the image of the public leader and national leader of its official, it is expected from the office of the Prime Minister, that he should know, understand and properly guide the public of India 
 janamanas ke pratinidhi hone ke naate, mahatvapurn rashtriya diwason or samarohon main pradhanmantri ke ahm paaramparik evam chinhatmak kirdaar rahaa he
 Over time, many conventional duties have evolved on the Prime Minister
