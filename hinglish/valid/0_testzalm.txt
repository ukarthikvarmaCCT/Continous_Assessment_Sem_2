 nishpaadan pareekshan, computer vigyaan ke ubharate abhyaas nishpaadan ejineering kaa ek up-samucchy he, jo pranali kii dizine or sanrachana main nishpaadan ko upar uthaane kaa prayaas karata he
 Performance testing can serve various purposes
 vah siddh kar saktaa he ki pranali nishpaadan mandandon ko puraa karti he
 It can compare two systems to see which system performs better
 yaa yah moolyankan kar saktaa he ki pranali yaa kaarybhaar ke kis ang kii vajah se nishpaadan karaab rahaa he
 Software engineers, in the case of diagnostics, use tools such as a profiler to test which instruments or parts of software are responsible for poor performance or to maintain a flowability level for an acceptable acceptable response time
 For the cost performance of the new system, it is important that performance testing efforts begin at the beginning of the development project and continue until deployment
 The more delay a performance defect detects, the higher the cost of its resolution
 yah kriyaatmak pareekshan ke maamle main sateek he, lekin uske kaary-kshetra kii samgr prakruti ke kaaran, utana hi adhik nishpaadan pareekshan ke liye bhi
 In performance testing, it is often important to have test conditions similar to the expected actual usage
 tathaapi vaastavik vyavhaar main yah puri tarah sambhav nahin he
 The reason is that the workload of production systems is random in nature and while test workloads do a good job of mimicking what is likely to happen in a production environment, it is impossible to replicate this workload variability - except for the simplest In the system
 shithil-yugmit sanrachanaatmak karyanvayan ne nishpaadan pareekshan ke saath atirikt jatiltaaon kii sristi kii he
 Coordinated performance testing is required to accurately replicate production-like conditions for enterprise services or assets
 is gatividhi se judi jatiltaaon or vittiya tathaa samay kii zaruuraton ke kaaran, ab kuch sanghathan sansadhano kii kshamta tathaa apekshaaon ko samajhane tathaa unki gunvattta visheshtaon ko satyapit / maanya karne ke liye apane nishpaadan pareekshan pariveshon main aise upkarnon ko upyog main laate hai jo utpaadan-jaisi sthitiyon ko taiyaar kar sakate hai or un par nigaraanee rakh sakate hai
 Many performance tests are initiated without considering the actual performance goals
 vyapaar ke nazariye se pehla sawaal hameshaa yah hona chahie ki "ham nishpaadan pareekshan kyon kar rahe hai?"anuprayog praudyogiki or uddeshy ke aadhaar par nishpaadan lakshya alag ho sakate hai, lekin unamem hameshaa nimna main se kuch shaamil hona chahie:- If an application identifies users through a login process, concurrency targets are a must
 paribhaasha ke anusaar, yah samavarti anuprayog prayoktaaon kii sabase adhik sankhya he, kisi bhi samay jiskaa samarthan anuprayog se apekshit he
 The workflow of your scripted exchanges can have an impact on the actual application concurrency, especially if the interactive part involves login and logout activity
 yadi aapke anuprayog main prayoktaaon kii koi avadharana nahin he, to aapkaa nishpaadan lakshya adhiktam pravaah kshamta yaa aadan-pradaan dar par aadhaarit hone kii sambhaavna he
 a common example may be accidental browsing of a web site such as Wikipedia
 yah ek anuprayog node ke liye anya ke anurodh par anukriya karne main lagane vaale samay ko nirdisht karata he
 a common example would be an HTTP 'GET' request from a browser client to a web server
 This is the case with the response time that all load testing tools actually measure
 yah praasangik hoga ki anuprayog paridrishy ke sabhi nodes ke bich sarwar anukriya kaal lakshya nirdhaarit kiye jaaen
 a difficult topic to deal with by load testing devices, since they generally have no concept of what is happening within a node other than identifying a time period where there is no activity 'on the wire'
 pratipaadan anukriya kaal maapne ke liye aam taur par nishpaadan pareekshan paridrishy ke ang ke rup main kaaryaatmak pareekshan lipiyaan sammilat hon, jo ek aisi visheshta he jisaki peshkash kai lod pareekshan upkaran nahin karte hai
 This is the simplest form of performance testing
 bhaar pareekshan aam taur par kisi vishisht apekshit lod ke antargat anuprayog ke vyavhaar ko samajhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This load can be the concurrent number of expected users exchanging specific times over a specified period
 yah pareekshan sabhi mahatvapurn vyapaar ke mahatvapurn aadan-pradaan kaa anukriya kaal degaa
 yadi database, anuprayog sarwar aadi kii bhi nigaraanee kii jaae, to yah saadhaaran pareekshan hi anuprayog software kii kinhin baadhaon kii ore ingit kar saktaa he
 This test is commonly used to understand the upper limit of capacity in the application scenario
 is prakaar kaa pareekshan, atyadhik bhaar ke samay anuprayog kii majbooti ke nirdhaaran ke liye kiya jaataa he or anuprayog prashaskon ko yah nirdhaarit karne main madad detaa he ki kya apekshit adhiktam seemaa se vartmaan bhaar adhik hone se anuprayog samuchit rup se nishpadit kar sakegaa
 This test is typically performed to determine if the application will be able to handle the constant expected load
 During capacity testing, memory usage is monitored to detect potential leakage
 saath hi nishpaadan hraas mahatvapurn he, lekin aksar ise andekha kiya jaataa he
 That is, to ensure that the flow capacity and / or response time after some long periods of continuous activity is as good or better than at the start of the test
 jaisaa ki naam se spasht he, upyogkartaaon kii sankhya kii majbooti ke pareekshan dwaara anuprayog ke vyavhaar ko samajhnaa hi spike pareekshan he; ki kya nishpaadan prabhavit hoga, anuprayog asafal hoga, yaa vah bhaar main naatakeey parivartanon ko sambhaal sakegaa
 Configuration testing is another conversion of traditional performance testing
 bhaar ke pariprekshya main nishpaadan ke pareekshan kii bajaay aap anuprayog nishpaadan or vyavhaar par anuprayog paridrishy ke vinyas parivartanon ke prabhaav kaa pareekshan kar rahe hai
 a common example would be to experiment with different methods of load-balancing
 nishpaadan pareekshan ke liye anany to nahin, par is shabd kaa prayog anuprayog samasya main parinat hone vaale pareekshan karyanvayan ke doharaav ko varnit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Often used to isolate and confirm the area of error
 anuprayog kii ek sthir rachana, jahaan tak sambhav ho jo utpaadan parivesh ko pratibimbit kare
 The performance testing environment should not be combined with the UAT or development environment
 This is critical because if a UAT or integral test or other test is being performed in the same environment, the results obtained from the performance test may not be reliable
 As a best practice it will always be appropriate that a different environment like the production environment is available for performance testing as much as possible
 katipay bahut hi saamaanya myth neeche die gaye hai
 1
 Performance testing is done to break the system
 tanaav pareekshan pranali ke brake-point ko samajhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Normal load testing is usually done to understand the behavior of the application under otherwise expected user loads
 spike lod jaisi anya apekshaaon ke aadhaar par, vistrut samay ke nirantar lod ke liye spike, andurence soke yaa stress testing kii zarurat hogi
 2
 Performance testing should only be done after system integration testing
 haalanki yah adhiktar udyog kaa maanak he, nishpaadan pareekshan anuprayog ke praarambhik vikaas charan main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Such an approach is known as initial performance testing
 yah drushtikon nishpaadan maanakon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue anuprayog ke samgr vikaas ko sunishchit karegaa
 is prakaar anuprayog ko jari karne se thik pehle nishpaadan bag kaa pataa chalanaa or uske sudhaar main shaamil laagat ko kaaphi had tak kam kiya ja saktaa he
 3
 Performance testing involves only scripts and any application changes will require normal refactoring of scripts
 nishpaadan pareekshan swayan software udyog main ek vikasshil vigyaan he
 Although scripting is important in itself, it is only one of the components in performance testing
 kisi bhi nishpaadan pareekshak ke liye badi chunauti he karyanvayan hetu jaanch prakaar kaa nirdhaaran or nishpaadan adchanon ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye vibhinn nishpaadan countaron kaa vishleshan
 The second section of the myth related to application changes that would result in only requiring a little refactoring in scripts is also incorrect, because any change in the UI, especially in web protocols, needs to be redeveloped from scratch again
 Will be This problem gets bigger if the protocols involved include Web Services, Siebel, Web Click and Script, Citrix, SAP
 nishpaadan pareekshan praudyogiki ek yaa adhik PC yaa unics sarwar ko injectoron ke rup main kaary karne ke liye tainaat karata he - jinamein prayek asankhya prayoktaaon kii upasthiti kaa anukaran karte hai or prayek aise host ke saath anyonya kriya ke swachaalit anukram ko chalaate hai, jiske nishpaadan kaa pareekshan kiya ja rahaa he 
 aam taur par, ek alag PC pareekshan sanchaalak ke rup main kaary karata he, jo prayek injector se matrix kaa samanvayan or sangrahan karata he tathaa reporting ke prayojan se nishpaadan data kaa milan karata he
 The usual sequence is to increase the load - starting with a small number of virtual users and increasing the number to some maximum duration
 Test results show how performance varies with load, given as number of users vs
 response time
 is tarah ke pareekshanon ko nishpadit karne ke liye vibhinn upkaran uplabdh hai
 Tools in this category typically carry out a system of tests that simulate real users towards the system
 kabhi-kabhi parinaamon se kuch vishamataayen prakat hoti hai, udhaaharan ke liye, jabaki ausat anukriya kaal sweekaarya ho saktaa he, vahiin aise kuch pramukh sarvatha bhinn aadan-pradaan rahete hai jinako puraa karne main kaafii samay lagata he - jo sambhawatah aksham databes prashnon, chitron aadi kii vajah se ho
 Performance testing can be combined with stress testing to see if an acceptable load exceeds - does the system crash? If the heavy burden is reduced, how long does it take to recover? Does it fail in such a way that collateral damage occurs? vishleshnatmak nishpaadan modelling ek spredshit main anuprayog ke vyavhaar model karne kii ek paddati he
 The model is delivered a measure of exchange resource expectations, measured by the exchange mix
 maape gaye aadan-pradaan sansaadhan maang ko ghantevaar sansaadhan maang kaa pataa lagane ke liye joda jaataa he or sansaadhan bhaar ke praapt karne ke liye ghantevaar sansaadhan kshamta se vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The response time can be calculated using the response time formula, r = response time, s = service time, u = load) and calibrated with the results of performance tests
 vishleshnatmak nishpaadan modelling, vaastavik yaa pratyaashit kaarobaari upyog ke aadhaar par dizine vikalpon ke moolyankan or pranali kaa aakaar ghataane kii anumati detaa he
 It is therefore faster and cheaper than performance testing, although it requires a thorough understanding of the hardware platform
 yah nishpaadan vinirdeshon ko nirdisht karne or kisi nishpaadan pareekshan yojana main unke pralekhan ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Ideally, this is done during the requirements of the development phase of a system development project, prior to a design effort
 adhik jaankaree ke liye nishpaadan ejineering dekhen
 However, performance testing is often not performed against a specification, ie no one would have expressed what the maximum allowable response time should be for a specific number of users
 Performance testing is often used as part of the process of execution profile tuning
 yahaan vichaar "kamazor kadi" kii pahchaan se he - nishchit rup se pranali kaa koi to hissaa he, jise yadi tezi ke saath anukriya karne ke liye vyavasthit kiya jaataa he, to parinamtah samgr pranali teji se chal sakati he
 Sometimes it is a difficult task to identify which part of the system represents this critical path and some test tools include instrumentation that runs on the server and the exchange time, database access time, overhead network And other servers report monitors, which can be analyzed with raw performance statistics
 is tarah ke upkaran ke bina kisi ek ko sarwar par Windows task prabandhak par yah dekhne ke liye jhuke rahanaa hoga ki nishpaadan pareekshan kitna CPU lod srujit kar rahe hai 
 It is the case of a company that spent a large amount of money to optimize its software without properly analyzing the problem
 He eventually had to rewrite the 'passive loop' of the system, where he found that the system spent most of its time, but still with one of the world's most efficient passive loops, apparently not a single particle improvement in overall performance! nishpaadan pareekshan ko web bhar main nishpadit kiya ja saktaa he or yahaan tak ki desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki yah mana jaataa he ki internet kaa hi anukriya kaal kshetravaar badalata rahata he
 This can also be done within the office, although routers will need to be configured to enter the gaps, as is commonly applied on public networks
 From a realistic point of view the load should be introduced into the system
 For example, if 50% of the users of the system are accessing the system through an Aadhaar 56K modem connection and the remaining half via T1, then the load injector loads the same connections or following the same user profile, the network latency of such connections Follow prayoktaaon kii sambhavya charam sankhya ke bare main bayaan hameshaa madadgaar sabit hoga, jinke dwaara vyastatam samay main pranali ke upyog kii sambhaavna he
 If such a statement is also found that constitutes the maximum permissible 95 percent of the response time, then an injector configuration can be used to test whether the proposed system meets that specification
