 Shamsher Singh has his own island called al-shifa, in which he trades arms and drugs
 sikandar singh shamsher kaa god liya betaa he, or usee ke saath sanjana or suraj uske judwa bachche hai
 Yash is very close to Shamsher's empire and a confidant of Alexander
 pichley hue ghatnaon main dikhaaya jaataa he ki ran vijay shamsher kaa dushman he, jo shamsher ke vyapaar main pareshaaniyon ko paidaa karte rahata he
 When Sanjana and Suraj turn 25, their lawyer narrates the will of their mother, according to which they will both own 25-25% of their property and Alexander will get 50% share
 saaf-saaf is tarah kii pakshpaat ko dekh kar un logon ko sikandar se ghrinaa hone lagati he
 Shamsher tells both that Alexander is the son of his elder brother Ranchod Singh
 kahani phir puraane samay, 1970 ke dashak main handiya gaanv main chale jaati he
 In which the history of the Singh family is told

 Shamsher then sends his elder brother's son, Alexander, to Beijing to study, and takes Suraj, Sanjana, and his widowed mother to Cambodia

 Alexander later tells him that it was Sanjana and Suraj's trick, so that they can ruin Alexander
 yash bhi sikandar ke saath mil jaataa he, par ye baat sanjana or suraj ko nahin pataa chalati he
 Then they all set out to take that hard disk together
 jab sikandar us hard discs ko shamsher ko de detaa he, to shamsher uske car main bam rakh kar use uda detaa he or un netaaon se milane chale jaataa he, jinke video us discs main maujuud hai
 In front of the leaders and their two twins, Shamsher tells that Alexander has died in the bomb blast
 uske baad wo jaise hi hard discs ko jodta he, uske hosh ud jate hai
 The hard disk contains a video of Alexander's mother, which he himself created, rather than videos of those leaders
 jisamen wo bataati he ki ranchhod singh kaa khun shamsher ne kiya tha or wo donon judwa bachche bhi ranchhod singh ke hi hai
 After this Alexander comes and tells how he saved his life from the bomb blast with the help of Raghu Chacha

 vitt main, poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model kaa upyog kisi poonjigat parisampatti ke liye saidhantik rup se upyukt vaanchit pratilabh dar gyaat karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jab is parisampatti ko ek pehle se hi suvishakheekrut sanvibhag main joda janaa ho, tathaa jabaki us parisampatti kaa ashaakhneey jokhim gyaat ho
 In this model the intractable risk of the asset, which is often represented by 'beta' in the finance sector, is taken into account and also the expected return on the market and the expected return on the theoretical risk-free asset
 siepiem kaa suzav he ki kisi niveshak kii share poonji kii laagat kaa nirdhaaran 'beta' se hota he
 ”: 2 The broad form of this model is the bi-beta model, which distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta

 This version was more rigorous in empirical testing and was an effective contributor to the global acceptance of CPM
 mulya nirdhaaran va portpholio chayan ke kai aadhunik tareekon ke aagaman tathaa antarpanan anubhavik khaamiyon, ke baavjood apni saadhaaranta va vibhinn prakaar paristhitiyon main upyogita ke kaaran siepiem abhi bhi adhik prachlit he
 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line compared to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 β tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko β ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E− Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki β se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e − p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It can be found out by the CAMP that what should be the expected return ie adjustment rate, taking into account the relative risk of a particular asset
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i
e
, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 koi niveshak esa bhi kar saktaa he ki vah apni nidhi kaa kuch hissaa to jokhimayukt sampattiyon main nivesh kare tathaa kuch hissaa nakad bachaakar rakhe, jise jokhim rahit dar par kamai hoti rahe
 
 yahan par jokhimayukt va jokhimamukt kaa anupaat overall return ko nirdhaarit nahin karata - yah sambandh nishchit hi linear he
 In this way it is possible that a certain return can be achieved by any one of the following types: haalaanki ek nishchit pratilabh ke liye, uparokt main se koi ek vikalp hi kushal siddh hoga 
 Since the risk-free asset is not necessarily correlated with any other asset, the second option will usually have less deviation, which would make it more efficient of the two
 yah sambandh prabhavi seemaa par sthit anya portpholios ke liye bhi sahi hoga : ucch pratilabh ke saath kuch nakad- adhik kushal he bajaay - usee pratilabh dar par maatr nimna pratilabh vaale portpholio ke
 For a fixed risk-free rate, there will be only one efficient portfolio that can be combined with cash to achieve a minimum risk position for any return
 yahi market portpholio he
 All investors: dwi-beta model urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The difference between the CPM and bi-beta models is that the CPM model recognizes that the upward and the succeeding betas are the same, whereas the bi-beta model does not believe so
 asi manyata kabhi virale hi thik hoti he, atah dwi-beta model ko hi adhik upyukt mana jaataa he

 He was the resident poet of King Harshavardhana
 unke do pramukh granth hai: harshcharitam tathaa kadambari
 Harshacharitam was the life-character of King Harshavardhana and Kadambari was the first novel in the world
 kadambari purna hone se pehle hi banbhatta ji kaa dehanth ho gaya to upanyaas puraa karne kaa kaam unke putr bhushanbhatta ne apane haath main liya
 Both texts are considered important texts of Sanskrit literature

 Mahakavi Banabhatta has attained the same place in the field of prose composition as that of Kalidasa in the field of Sanskrit poetry
 paashchaadvarti lekhakon ne ek swar main baan par prashastiyon kii abhivrishti kii he
 Govardhanacharya's author of Aryasaptati is- tilkamanjari ke lekhak dhanpal kii prashasti is prakaar he- Trilochan praised Baan in the following verse - raghavpandavi ke lekhak kaviraj ke anusaar- These are just a few of the eternal commendations of later writers
 baan sanskrit ke kuch gine-chune lekhakon main se ek hai jinke jivan evam kaal ke vishay main nishchit rup se gyaat he
 In the role of Kadambari and in the first two incantations of Harshacharitam, Baan has given detailed information about his dynasty
 son nadi ke tat par sthit preetikut naam ke gram main vatsyayangotreey vidwadbrahman kul main banne janm liya
 Baan tells the origin of his dynasty to Saraswati and Vatsa, brother of Saraswat, son of Dadhichi
 vatsa kaa vanshaj kuber tha jiskaa chaturth putr pashupat baan kaa prapitamah tha
 Baan's grandfather was named Arthapati who had eleven sons
 baan ke pita kaa naam chitrabhanu tha
 His mother Rajyadevi died in Baan's infancy
 unka paalan-poshan unke pita ke dwaara hi hua
 Baan was just fourteen years old when his father left a lot of property for him and died
 yauvan kaa prarambh evam sampatti hone ke kaaran, baan sansar ko swayan dekhne ke liye ghar se chal pade
 He established relationships with different types of people
 apane samavayask mitron tathaa saathiyon main baan ne praakrit ke kavi ishan, do bhaat, ek chikitsak kaa putr, ek pathak, ek suvarnakaar, ek ratnakar, ek lekhak, ek pustakaavarak, ek mardagik, do gayak, ek pratihaari, do vanshivadak, ek gaan ke adhyaaapak, ek nartak, ek aakshik, ek nat, ek nartki, ek tantric, ek dhaatuvidya main nishnaat or ek aindrajalik aadi kii gananaa kii he
 He traveled to many countries and returned to his place Pritikoot
 vahaan rahete hue unhen harshavardhan ke chachere bhai krishna kaa ek sandesh mila ki kuch chugalkhoron ne raja se baan kii ninda kii he isliye ve turant hi raja se milane gaye or do din kii yatra ke pashchaat ajiravati ke tat par raja ko mili
 In the first interview, Baan was very disappointed because Malavadhish, the Emperor's companion, said 'ayamasoubhungangah')
 Astu, Baan explained his position and the emperor was pleased with him and after some months with the emperor, returned Baan and he presented Harsha as a cheerful
 Started writing a biography of baan kii aatmakatha yahaan samaapt ho jaati he or baan ke antim samay ke vishay main hamen kuch bhi gyaat nahin he
 But it can be inferred that Baan got protection and he also paid the price by writing it with great joy
 baan kaa bhushanbhatta athwa bhattapulind naam kaa ek putr tha jisane baan kii mrityu ke pashchaat kadambari ko sampoorn kiya
 Hence Kadambari was completed by two authors
 baan ke kaal nirnay main koi kathinaayee nahin he
 At the beginning of Harshacharit, he tells Harsha a king who rules - harsh ke vansh kaa varnan udhaahrantah prabhakarvardhan evam rajyavardhan ke naam yah nihsandeh siddh karte hai ki baan kannauj ke samraat harshavardhan ke raajakavi the
 This period of the arrow also corresponds to external evidence
 baan kaa ullekh 9veen shatabdi main alankaar shaastra ke gyaata anandavardhan ne kiya
 Possibly the arrows had taken place long before Anandavardhana
 vaaman ne bhi baan kaa ullekh kiya
 Vaudpati Raj, the author of Gaurwaho, also praises Baan
 kadambari or harshcharitam ke atirikt kai duusari rachanaayen bhi baan kii maani jaati hai
 Among them is Chandishatak, the hymn of Durga, based on the goddess Mahatmya of Markandeya Purana
 praayah ek naatak ‘parvati parinay’ bhi baan dwaara rachit mana jaataa he
 But in fact its author is a postwar Vaman Bhattaban
 ek vidwaan aalochak ke anusaar visheshanbahul vaakya rachana main, shleshamay arthon main tathaa shabdon ke aprayukt arthon keprayog main hi baan kaa vaishishty he
 His prose is elegance and has the power to provide strength in long circles
 ve shlesh, upama, roopak, utpreksha, sahokti, parisankhya or visheshtah virodhabhas kaa bahulata se prayog karte he
 As is clear from the mention of Achodasarovar, he has the right to describe nature and other types of description
 kadambari main shuknas tathaa harshcharitam ke prabhakarvardhan kii shikshaaon se baan kaa maanav prakruti kaa gahan adhyayan suspasht he
 The vocabulary of the arrow is broad and often uses all the equivalents of a word
 unhone ‘dhwani’ ke liye 19 shabdon kaa prayog kiya he
 Similarly, arrows are used in the use of adjectives and it appears that the adjectives will not end
 unke varnan jaise ujjayini tathaa divakar mitra ke ashram kaa varnan vistrut hone par bhi nirdosh, vaividhypurna evam prabhaavshaalee hai
 Banabhatta's knowledge of human nature is amazing
 uskaa koi bhi tatva anudghaatit nahin rahaa
 It is rightly said- baan ne kisi bhi kathaneey baat ko choda nahin jiske kaaran koi bhi pashchaadvati lekhak baan ko atikrant na kar sakaa
 On the basis of the poet's all-round talent, extensive knowledge, wonderful narration style and subtle description of each subject, it is well-known that Baan has not left any description untouched and there is much left to say beyond what he said
 Does not remain baan ne jitani sundarata, sahrudayata or sookshmadrushti se bahya prakruti kaa varnan kiya he, utani hi gaharaai se antah prakruti or manobhaavon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 His descriptions are so broad and accurate, that the reader experiences that he would have thought or done the same in those circumstances
 praatah kaal varnan, sandhyavarnan, shudrakavarnan, shukvarnan, chandalakanya varnan aadi main baan ne varnan hi nahin kiya he, apitu prayek vastu kaa sajiv chitra upasthit kar diya he
 In the Shukanasopadesh given to Chandrapid, the climax of the poet's talent is reflected
 kavi kii lekhnee bhavodrek main bahati hui si prathit hoti he
 In Shuknasopadesh it seems as if Saraswati is speaking in a tangible form
 baan ke varnanon main bhav or bhashaa kaa saamanjasy, bhavanukool bhashaa kaa prayog, alankaaron kaa susanyat prayog, bhashaa menaroh or avaroh tathaa lambi samasayukt padaavalee ke pashchaat laghu padaavalee aadi gun vishesh rup se praapt hote hai
 In each description, there is a first-hand description of the subject, a lot of syllogisms are found, then syllabic analogies and motivations, the latter ending with contradiction or parody
 shleshamulak upama prayog, virodhabhas or parisankhya ke prayogon main clishtataa, durbodhata or bauddhik parishram adhik he
 At some places, the descriptions have become so long that the verbs are difficult to find even after searching
 mahasweta-darshan main ek vaakya 67 panktiyon kaa he or kadambari darshan main to ek vaakya 72 panktiyon kaa ho gaya he
 The tradition of adjectives of adjectives is so long that the basic verb disappears
 aise varnanon main varnan kaa swaastya rah jaataa he, par kathapravaah pad-pad par pratihat ho jaataa he
 The arrow had unique authority over emotion and imagination
 uske vaakyon kii lambaai asaadhaaran hote hue bhi manoranjak tathaa utkrisht he
 Due to the richness of expressions and abundance of expression in the works of arrow, they affect the hearts of the gentlemen, in fact it is rightly said: em en venkatchelaiyya bharat ke sarvocch nyaayalay ke bhootpurv nyaayadhish rahe hai

 Optics is that part of geometric optics that studies the movement of light by treating it as a 'ray'
 isaliye ise 'kiran prakaashiki' bhi kehete hai
 According to the belief of ray optics, as long as light moves in a homogeneous medium, its path is in a straight line
 jahaan par do madhyam milte hai, vahaan prakaash kirne mud jaati hai In fact, to a large extent simplification of optics is geometric optics
 jyamitiya prakaashiki ke antargat prakaash ke vivartan or vyatikaran kii koi vyakhya nahin di ja sakati
 But geometrical optics is capable of producing images and explaining optical contrast
 duusare shabdon main, jyamitiya prakaashiki ke dwaara parinaam tab tak shuddh aate hai jab tak vastuon kaa aakaar prakaash ke tarangadairghy kii tulana main kaaphi bada ho
 Geometric optics is the part of optics in which the geometry of rays of light and the process of reflection-formation by optical system is studied
 isamen prakaashiya upkarnon ke gunon tathaa un lens|lenson]], darpanon evam samparshwo kaa vivaran sannihit hota he jinke dwaara prakaashiya upkarnon kii rachana hoti he
 It is a known fact that rays of light move in a straight line
 unke is gun ko prakaash kaa rujurekhiy sancharan kehete hai
 The substance through which rays of light pass through is called 'medium'
 jab prakaash kii kirane kisi madhyam se chalakar duusare madhyam main pahunchati hai to teen kriyaayein hoti hai : Some, or more, portion of the rays of light are returned to the medium before the dividing plane of both mediums
 is kriya kaa paravartan kehete hai
 Some part of the rays of light are absorbed at the separator plane
 or The remaining part of the rays of light move to another medium
 is kriya ko apvartan kehete hai
 Geometric optics is based on some simple assumptions
 ve hai - Rays of light move in a simple line in a medium
 prakaash kirnon ke swatantra vitaran kaa niyam Law of reflection apvartan kaa niyam The law of evolution of the light beam - According to this, the motion of a light beam is considered to be moving in the opposite direction of its forward movement
 paravartan or apvartan prakriya ke samay prakaash kii kirane kuch niyamon kaa paalan karti hai
 The following is the rule of reflection: 1
 apati kiran, vibhaajak tal main aapatan bindu par daalaa gaya abhilamb evam paravartit kiran, teenon ek hi tal main sthit hote hai The incidental and reflected rays lie opposite to the normal and aapatan evam paravartan kone paraspar baraabar hote hai
 <i = <r apvartan sambandhi niyam nimnlikhit hai : 1
 The incident ray, the normal and refracted rays inserted at the incident point in the dividing plane, all three are located in the same plane
 2
 apati evam apavartit kirane abhilamb ke paraspar vipareet ore sthit hoti hai
 And aapatan evam apvartan konon kii jyaaon main ek sthir anupaat hota he
 This ratio is expressed by the Greek letter mu and is called the refractive index of the second medium relative to the first medium
 == prism se apvartan == Bharatkosh Quran Bharatkosh Editorial Calendar Quiz Full Internal Reflection Full Internal Reflection Full Internal Reflection is a optical phenomenon
 prakaash hameshaa hi ek madhyam se prakaashiya rup se saghan madhyam main ja saktaa he, lekin yah viral madhyam main hameshaa nahin ja saktaa
 When light rays are incident on the surface of the sparse medium and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the light does not refract, but the entire light is reflected and returned to the same medium
 is ghatana ko 'purna aantarik paravartan' kehete hai
 Optical fiber is a useful use of full internal reflection
 prakaashiya tantuon kaa kaary purna aantarik paravartan ke siddhanth par hi aadhaarit he
 Generally the refractory plane of the optical instruments being treated are the rotating planes, whose symmetric axis is common
 is samamiti se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki aksh par sthit prayek bindu kaa bimb aksh par hi sthit kisi duusare bindu par banataa he
 In other words it can be said that the entire axis is its own object
 kisi apvartak tantra ke aksh par ek aisa bindu hota he jisase nikalanevaali prakaash kii kirane apvartak tantra ke baahar aksh ke samaantar nikalati hai or is prakaar us bindu kaa bimb anant par banataa he
 That point is called the first focus point of the refractive system
 pratham focus bindu se hokar aksh ke samakonik khinchaa hua mana gaya tal pratham focus tal kaha jaataa he
 The rays moving from a point on this plane become parallel after refraction
 dwitiya focus bindu apvartak tantra ke aksh par sthit vah bindu he jisapar anant se aksh ke samaantar aanevaali sabhi kirane abhisarit hoti hai, arthath jis bindu par, anant par sthit vastu kaa bimb banataa he
 From this point, the hypothetical plane of the axis is called the second focus plane
 kisi lens ke pratham focus bindu se apsaarit honevaali kirnon kaa shanku lens ke donon dharaatalon par vichlit hota he
 On increasing the incident rays forward and the output rays backwards, the points of passage are located on the common plane, called the first principal plane of the lens
 lens ke do dharaatalon par do baar vichlan, mukhya samtal par kiran ke ek hi baar vichlan ke tulya hota he
 Similarly, the rays coming parallel to the axis of the lens, after refraction, lead to the second focus point
 yadi apati kirnon ko aage kii ore tathaa apavartit kirnon ko peeche kii ore badhaayaa jaay to unke pariched bindu ek samtal par sthit honge, jise dwitiya mukhya samtal kehete hai
 The points along the axis of these planes are called the first and second principal points respectively
 pratham focus duuri tathaa dwitiya mukhya bindu se dwitiya focus bindu kii duuri ko dwitiya focus duuri kehete hai
 Many things have to be kept in mind in the construction of optical instruments, especially that all the rays coming from a pointwise object are collected on a pointwise object, that is, they are free from the defect of aberration
 is hetu yah aavashyak he ki bimb main goleey tathaa varni vipathan na hone paaen, anyathaa bimb vikrut hoga or ek sthaan par banane ke bajaay bhinn bhinn rangon ke kai bimb ban jaayenge
 One has to find a characteristic function to diagnose these problems
 kisi vastu se chalakar apvartak tal par pahunchnewali sabhi kirnon dwaara bananevaale bimb kaa vivechan karne par hamen pataa chalata he ki vah bimb kshetravakrata tathaa vikruti aadi dosha se yukt rahata he
 Therefore Gauss suggested limiting the idea to only those rays which move very close to the axis of the refractive system

 Durgadas was the son of Asakaran Rathore, a minister of the Marwar ruler Maharaja Jaswant Singh
 unki maan apane pati or unki anya patniyon ke saath nahin raheen or jodhpur se dur raheen

 On the way, an old man was found, who was a well-wisher of Durgadas
 kehane laga bhai durgadas! acha hota, yadi aap aaj raaj-darbar na jate; kyonki aaj darbar jane main aapaki kushal nahin
 As far as i have come to know, Maharaj has secretly given permission to kill you with the advice of his selfish friends
 durgadas ne kaha – ‘ bhai! ab main vruddh hua, mujhe maranaa to he hi phir kshatriya hokar mrityu se kyon darun? rajputi main kalank lagaaun; maut se darkar peeche laut jaaun! is prakaar kahata hua nirbhay singh ke samaan darbar main pahunchaa or haath jodakar maharaj se tirthayatr ke liye vidaa maangi
 Maharaj said with an upper mind - 'chachaji! Your separation will be very sad for us; But now you are old, and the question is of pilgrimage; That is why it is not done either
 acha to jaaie, parantu jahaan tak sambhav ho sheeghra hi laut aaie
 Durgadas said - 'just as the Maharaja commanded and walked; But returned to the door
 maharaj ne poocha chachaa ji, kyon? durgadas ne kaha – ‘ maharaj, ab aaj na jaaoongaa; mujhe abhi yaad aayaa ki maharaj yashawantisingh ji mujhe ek gupt kosh kii chaabi de gayi the, parantu abhi tak main na to aapako gupt khajaana hi bataa sakaa or na chaabi hi de sakaa; isliye vah bhi aapako saunp duun, tab jaaun? kyonki ab main bahut vruddh ho gaya hum, na-jane kab or kahaan mar jaaun? tab to yah aseem dhan-raashi sab mitti main mil jaayegi
 On hearing this, the greed suppressed Ajitsingh

 Will there be no more opportunities? Will be seen again yah vichaar kar apane mitron ko sanket kiya
 Realizing this, one went ahead and removed the appointed man from there

 Came home, took arms, rode a horse and sent Maharaj saying that Durgadas did not want to die the death of dogs

 The instrument with known precision is called standard
 yadi tharmametre kii nalee kaa bhitari vyas sarvatra samaan na ho to baraabar duuri par digari kaa chihn lagane se trutiyaan utpann hongi
 As a result, for a true measurement of heat it is necessary to know how much error is there on each sign
 isi prakaar prayek maapak yantra ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak ho jaataa he ki prayek chihn par kitni truti he
 This is called calibration

 DNA fingerprinting technology is used to solve the criminal cases
 iske saath hi maatrutiv, pitrutv yaa vyaktigat pahchaan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye iskaa prayog hota he
 At present, fingerprint is considered the best among methods of identification
 jeev jantuon, manushyon main vishesh sanrachanayukta vah rasayan jo use vishisht pahchaan pradaan karata he, use diene kehete hai
 In this method, a person's DNA is identified by biological parts such as blood, hair, saliva, semen or other cell-sources
 diene fingerprint vishisht diene kram kaa prayog karata he, jise microcetellite kaha jaataa he
 Microsatellites are small fragments of DNA
 sharir ke kuch hisson main inaki sankhya alag-alag hoti he

 haalanki diene kanon kaa dhaancha har vyakti main ek samaan hota he, lekin unhen gadhane vaale buniyadi avyavon kaa kram sabhi main samaan nahin hota
 This difference is used to find identities between members of the same species
 is prakriya ko genetic fingerprinting or diene profiling bhi kaha jaataa he
 It was developed in 1984 by Sir Alec Jeffreys, scientist at the University of British Leicester
 forencik vigyaan main diene fingerprint kaa upyog hota he
 Forensic examination no longer requires actual fingerprint

 These images look quite different from each other and each image is unique
 ek hi parivaar ke teen sadasyon ke gel pratichitra gailaree main dikhaae hai
 Here the images of mother and father are different, but the image of the son bears some resemblance to the images of mother and father
 yahaan samaan judawaan bacchon ke pratichitra ko dekhenge, to dikhataa he; ki ye donon purnataya ekasmaan hai
 Thus different individuals can be identified by DNA finger printing, the mother or father of the offspring can be identified; But it is not possible to identify identical twins
 tritiy charan Fourth phase pancham charan Parent and child prints judwaaon ke print Inability to print identities of twins di en e finger printing ek nutan evam shashakt takanic he, jo nimnlikhit kshetron main prayog main laayi ja sakati he:- Through DNA sealing, positive identification can be done at the individual level through blood semen, hair, mutilated dead body remains, teeth or bone fragments etc

 The Indian judicial system has accepted DNA finger printing as concrete evidence
 mritak ke sharir ke bikhare hue tukdon kii pahchaan karne ke liye bhi is takanic kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 This technique was used for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Chief Minister of Punjab Beant Singh
 inke atirikt anekon aparaadhon ke maamle is takanic dwaara sulajhaaye gaye hai
 Comparison of the commands received by DNA finger printing with the remains of the bodies of the dead defensemen during accidents, such as a war period, or a shipwreck, as compiled in the biographies of defense personnel
 The method can be proven

 Between 1872 and 1874, Bhandarkar was engaged to Professor Weber of Berlin between 1872 and 1874, at the beginning of an intellectual journey that began in Indian andquatari
 unhone unke saath patanjali ke kaal or patanjali kaa mahabhashya ke muddon par utsaahpurn taarkik or vivadaspad bahes kii

 baad main duusare kaarnon se isi tarah ke nirnay par goldstkar bhi pahunche
 In 1873, Bhandarkar improved Colonel Ellis's approach by an article in the Journal of Mumbai Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society

 unhone katyayan ko dakshin kaa mul nivasee siddh kiya
 In an 1874 article 'indus of Krishna in Patanjali Mahabhashya' in Indian Andtakwari, Bhandarkar reached the preamble by elaborating on the great quotations of the Mahabhashya, the construction of words and their origin
 The stories are of the mythological period, in the same way stories about the slaughter of Kansa and the subjugation of sacrifices by Krishna or Vasudev
 The period was known and popular

 In his view, the goal of the scholar should be the resolution of dry truth, and he should make every effort to determine the credibility of the available evidence

 saanskrithik samrajyavad yah vah niti he jisame jaanboojhkar kisi samskruti main duusari samskruti ko aropit kiya jaataa he, mishrit kiya jaataa he yaa protsahan diya jaataa he
 Often the other culture is that of a powerful military country, while the implantation is weak
 iskaa prayog videshi prabhaav ko nakaarne main bhi hota he yah kisi bhi rup main ho sakati he jaise barbi gudiya se khelnaa
 After the abolition of colonialism, the culturally and economically dominated countries resorted to the cultural measures they took to bring the societies of their former colonies and their lifestyles under their domination in indirect ways
 iskaa matlab he un saanskrithik mulyon, vichaaron or aacharan samhitaon kaa prachaar, prasar or niryaat jinhen ‘shreshth’ mana jaataa he
 There is another aspect of this coin as a result of which cultural imperialism causes destruction of the values and lifestyles of the local cultures of poor and backward countries and bypassing respectively

 lekin, samskruti-chintan ke kshetra main is vishay main ek bahes bhi maujuud he ki kya samskruti ke kshetra par is tarah ekatarfa prabhutv kaayam kiya ja saktaa he; or kya bhoomandaleekaran ko saanskrithik samarupata kaa vaahak samajhnaa uski jatilta kii ek sarlikrut samaj nahin he? The relationship between imperialism and culture in the world was first inaugurated in the seventies and eighties through the much-discussed thesis of Orientalism in the thinking of literature theorist Edward Saeed
 zaahir he ki said ne saanskrithik samrajyavad kii shinaakht saahitiyik roopon or vimarsh ke daayaron main kii thi
 It was only in the eighties that VS Napole used this expression for something else
 unhone apni do rachanaaon ‘emang da bellievers : ain islaamic jarney’ or ‘biyand bileef : islaamic exkargence emang da canvertid pipuls’ main islam kii shinaakht saanskrithik samrajyavad ke taur par kii
 They said that Islam has a tendency to color cultural diversity in its own color

 media visheshgyon ko saafe dikhaai pad rahaa tha ki pashchimi desh garib deshon ko apane yahan bane hue tivi serial or anya kaarykram laagat se kam daamon main niryaat kar rahe hai
 This definition of cultural imperialism changed somewhat after the process of globalization
 yah parivartan americakaran kii dharna ne kiya
 The reason for this was that American food, living and various forms of life-style also began to leave their mark on the developed European societies
 pehle is pariyojna main europe or america mil kar sakriy nazar aate the
 The idea of americanization was associated with the Clinton administration in a 1997 journal titled 'foreign Policy', by David Rathkoff's article 'in the Presence of Cultural Imperialism?' Got more air after its publication
 columbia vishvavidhyalay main international efers ke associat profesar or kisinger associats ke prabandh nideshak rathcof ne is lekh main imperializam ke cultural sanskaran ko sakaaratmak rup se pesh karte hue daawa kiya ki ise svaichhik rup se apanaaya jaae yaa jabariyaa, iske zariye saanskrithik vividhta or prakarantar se paristhitikeey vividhta kii sangraksha kii ja sakati he
 Rathkoff's argument cites bloodshed and massacres in the name of culture in the world, that tolerance should be promoted all over the world
 saanskrithik vividhta ke bheetar donon tarah ke pahalu maujuud hote hai
 Its aspects that encourage tolerance should be developed and the dimensions that stand against it should be abolished
 rathcof ko yah sweekaar karne main bhi koi hichak nahin thi ki internet, bhoomandaleekaran or angrezi bhashaa kaa istemaal america ke saanskrithik prabhaav ko badha rahaa he
 The thesis of cultural imperialism is also confirmed by quoting some sociological studies conducted in the seventies
 1975 main prakashit dorphman or matellart kii rachana haau tu read donald dak main dikhaaya gaya tha ki comics or anemeshan jaise saanskrithik utpaadon ke zariye ‘anya’ rashtriyataon kii nasli rudh chhaviyon kaa kaise istemaal kiya jaataa he
 On the same lines, TV commercials and consumer culture studies highlighted the capitalist cultural project that established the superiority of Western cultures
 lekin, poonjeewaad ke sabhi aalochak or adhyeta is tarah ke nishkarshon ko sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 In the light of the principles of Gramshi, thinkers who study culture believe that the field of culture cannot be subordinated like politics and economics
 uske bheetar pratirodh kii alag tarah kii kshamtaayen hoti hai jinke aadhaar par ek tarah kii saanskrithik raajnneeti kaa janm hota he
 Under the influence of this resistance, national governments also reject Western media products
 bhoomandaleekaran ke kuch adhyetaon ne bhi samskruti ke ekatarfa pravaah ke aagrah kii aalochana kii he
 He says that the development of the global system is presenting a much more complex view
 saanskrithik pravaah vibhinn dishaao se ho rahe hai
 Their structures are also complex in nature, not merely western or American or capitalist or consumerist
 agar ek taraf sienen news, ‘frends’, ‘sex and city’ or ‘desparat houseivz’ jaise america kaarykram hai, to duusari ore japan, laathini america or bharat jaise saanskrithik pravaah bhi hai
 These scholars also say that even where 'imperialist' programs are being watched, it would be unreasonable to assume that the audience assimilates them passively
 darshakon par sthaneey samskritiyon or paristhitiyon ke asar ko kam karke nahin aankaa janaa chahie
 Detailed research on the American serial 'dallas' has revealed that different nationalities and identities have different meanings
 iske alaava new media praudyogikiyon or media swaamitv ke badalte hue pattern ne bhi ekatarfa saanskrithik samrajyavad kii sambhaawanaaon ko kamazor kiya he

 Water also has no immediate effect on oil paintings
 isi kaaran yah madhyam itnaa lokapriy he
 Oil painting is usually applied to bursts of thick viscous paint dyed in oil on a canvas
 iske liye adhiktar alsi or post ke tel prayukt hote hai
 The choice of oils depends on interest and need in different countries

 The shamilat land of the village, which is used as pasture for grazing cattle, is best for planting trees
 puraani parati bhoomi main bhi, jo kheti ke kaam main nahin laai jaati, vriksh lagaae ja sakate hai
 All the work of planting and taking care of trees can be done under the supervision of Panchayats
