 According to the belief of devotees, the emergence of Acharya Nimbarka is said to be contemporary with Krishna's great-grandson Bajranabha and Parikshit's son Janamejaya in the post-kaal period
 inke pita arun rishi kii, shrimadbhagwat main parakshit kii bhagwatakatha shravan ke prasang sahit anek sthanon par upasthiti ko vishesh rup se batalaaya gaya he
 However, modern researchers prove the period of Nimbark between Vikram's 5th century and 12th century
 sampradaay kii manyatanusaar inhen bhagwaan ke pramukh aayudh ‘sudarshan’ kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 He was born in Arunashran of Vaiduryapatna
 inke pita arun muni or inaki mata kaa naam jayanti tha
 At the time of birth, he was named Niyamanand and settled in Braj during his childhood
 manyatanusaar apane guru naarad kii ajna se niyamanand ne govardhan kii talahati ko apni sadhana-sthali banaaya
 This boy was very miraculous since childhood
 ek baar govardhan sthit inke ashram main ek divabhoji yeti aayaa
 Naturally, the scriptures were discussed but a lot of time was spent in it and it was sunset
 yeti bina bhojan kiye jane laga
 Then the child Niyamananda pointed to the neem tree and said that it is not yet sunset, you should go after eating
 lekin yeti jaise hi bhojan karke uthaa to dekha ki raatri ke do pahar biit chuke the
 Since then, this child has been named 'nimbark', that is, the person who brings out extracts on the nimbus
 nimbarkacharya ne brahmasutra, upanishad or gita par apni tikaa likhakar apana samgr darshan prastut kiya
 His commentary is famous as 'vedanta Parijat Saurabh'
 inkaa mat ‘dwaitadvait’ yaa ‘bhedabhed’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to Acharya Nimbark, Jeeva, Jagat and Brahma have a real estrangement relationship
 nimbark in teenon ke astitv ko unke swabhaav, gun or abhivyakti ke kaaran bhinn maanate hai to tathvik rup se ek hone ke kaaran teenon ko abhinn maanate hai
 According to Nimbark, the worshiper Radhakrishna is the only Brahman
 dosarvapalli radhakrishnan ne apni suvikhyath pustak ‘bhartiya darshan’ main nimbark or unke vedant darshan kii charchaa karte hue likhaa he ki nimbark kii drushti main bhakthi kaa taatpary upasna na hokar prem anuraag he
 The Lord is always present for the benefit of his devoted devotee

 a standard volume is taken while using these devices
 gatik shyanta = k = h / r = At - b / t xxrep 5 
 xxrep 5 
 jahaan h = shyaantagunank he, r = drav kaa ghanatv he, tathaa a evam b = upkaran sthiraank hai tathaa t = dravapravaah kaa samay he
 For liquids that have very high viscosity, the second section of the sutra is zero and thus: k = h / r = At xxrep 6 
 xxrep 5 
 xxrep 5 
 Therefore, the ratio of dynamic visions, in two liquids, is given by the formula: K1 / K2 = t1 / t2 xxrep 5 
 xxrep 5 
 xxrep 5 
 And the same formula was used by Oswalt

 is jyotirling kii sthapana ke vishay main shivpurana main yah katha varnit he- Once the wives of Brahmins living in Maharishi Gautama's Tapovan got angry with his wife Ahilya on something
 unhone apane patiyon ko rishi gautam kaa apkaar karne ke liye prerit kiya
 Those Brahmins worshiped Lord Shree Ganeshji for this
 unki aradhana se prasann ho ganeshji ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha un brahmanon ne kaha- 'prabho! yadi aap ham par prasann hai to kisi prakaar rishi gautam ko is ashram se baahar nikaal den
 On hearing this, Ganeshji persuaded him to ask for such a bridesmaid
 kintu ve apane aagrah par atal rahe
 Eventually Ganeshji was forced to obey him
 apane bhakton kaa man rakhane ke liye ve ek durbal gaay kaa rup dhaaran karke rishi gautam ke khet main jaakar rahane lage
 Seeing the cow grazing the crop, the sage took a straw in his hand with great softness and grabbed it to grab it
 un trinon kaa sparsh hote hi vah gaay vahiin marakar gir padi
 Now there was a big cry
 saare brahman ekatra ho go-hatyara kahkar rishi gautam kii bhartsana karne lage
 Rishi Gautam was very surprised and saddened by this incident
 ab un saare brahmanon ne kaha ki tumhen yah ashram chhodkar anyatra kahin dur chale janaa chahie
 Staying close to the cow-killer will also cause us sin
 vivash hokar rishi gautam apni patni ahilya ke saath vahaan se ek kos dur jaakar rahane lage
 But those Brahmins made their stay there too difficult
 ve kehane lage- 'go-hatya ke kaaran tumhen ab veda-paath or yagyadi ke kaary karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin rah gaya
 'sage Gautama prayed to the Brahmins that you guys should give me some measure of my atonement and salvation
 tab unhone kaha- 'gautam! tum apane paap ko sarvatra sabko bataate hue teen baar puri prithvi kii parikrama karo
 Then return and fast here for a month
 iske baad 'brahmagiri' kii 101 parikrama karne ke baad tumhaari shuddhi hogi athwa yahan gangaji ko laakar unke jal se snaan karke ek karod parthiv shivlingon se shivaji kii aradhana karo
 After this, bathe in Gangaji again and revolve this Brahmagiri 11 times
 phir sau ghadon ke pavitra jal se parthiv shivlingon ko snaan karaane se tumhaara uddhaar hoga
 According to the Brahmins, Maharishi Gautama, after completing all those tasks, became fully engrossed with his wife and started worshiping Lord Shiva
 isse prasann ho bhagwaan shiv ne prakat hokar unase var maangane ko kaha
 Maharishi Gautam said to him- 'lord, i want you to free me from the sin of cow-slaughter
 ' bhagavan shiv ne kaha- 'gautam ! tum sarvatha nishpaap ho
 The crime of cow slaughtering was done fraudulently on you
 chal purvak aisa karwaane vaale tumhaare ashram ke brahmanon ko main dand dena chahta hoon
 ' is par maharishi gautam ne kaha ki prabhu! unheen ke nimitt se to mujhe aapkaa darshan praapt hua he

 mcdonald Hazrat Umar ibn al-khatab, E
 Muhammad Saheb's chief was among the four Sahaba
 vah hazarat abu bakr ke baad musalamaanon ke duusare khalipha chune gayi
 Muhammad was named as Farooq
 jiskaa arth satya or asaty main fark karne vaala
 His status among the followers of Muhammad sahab comes after Hazrat Abu Bakr
 umr khulpha-e-raashidin main duusare calipha chune gaye
 Omar proved to be the most successful caliph in the khulafa-e-rashidin
 musalmaan inako faruk-e-aazam tathaa amirul muminin bhi kehete hai
 European writers have written many books about him and given the title of Omar Mahan
 prasiddh lekhak maaikel ech
 heart ne apni prasiddh pustak di handred The 100: a Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, main hazarat umr ko shaamil kiya he
 Hazrat Umar was born in Mecca
 ye kurash khandaan se the
 i had learned to read writing in the days of ignorance, which in those days, the Arabs considered reading writing to be a useless task
 inkaa qad bahut ooncha, raubadaar cheharaa or gathila sharir tha
 Umar was one of the famous wrestlers of Mecca, who had a great influence in Mecca
 umr salanaa pahalwani ke muqablon main hissaa lete the
 Initially, Hazrat Umar was a staunch enemy of Islam
 or mohammad sahab ko jaan se maarna chaahate the
 Omar initially used to do fetishism
 umr makka main ek samrudgh parivaar se the, bahut bahadur tathaa diler vyakit the
 Omar did not like Muslims, nor did Muhammad's mission
 parantu paigambar muhammd sahab ek shaam kaabe ke paas jaakar allaah se dua kiya ki allaah umr ko yaa amr abu jahal donon main se jo tujko priy ho hidaayat de
 This prayer was accepted in favor of Omar
 umr ek baar paigambar ke katl ke iraade se nikle the, raste main naeem naam kaa ek shaks mila jisane umr ko bataaya ki unki bahan tathaa unke pati islam laa chuke hai
 Omar got angry and went to the sister's house
 vah donon ghar par kuran pard rahe the
 Umar started asking for the Quran but he refused
 umr krodhit hokar un donon ko maarane lage
 But his sister said we will die but will not leave Islam
 bahan ke chehre se khun tapakataa dekhakar umr ko shame aayi tathaa galati kaa ahsaas hua
 Said that i want to read the Quran, promised not to humiliate it
 jab umr ne kuran padhaa do bole yaqinan ye ishwar kii vaani he kisi manushya kii rachana nahin ho sakati
 In a miracle, Omar accepted the truth of the Quran and went to meet Muhammad
 mohammad sahab ko bahut prasannataa hui jab umr islam main daakhil ho gayi
 Muslims ran a wave of happiness over Omar's bringing Islam
 umr ne elaan kiya ki ab sab milke namaaz kaabe main padhenge jo ki pehle koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 Omar was an enemy of Islam but now he became the protector of Islam
 umr ko islam main dekhakar mohammad sahab ke shatruvon main koharaam much gaya
 Now Islam had got a sharp sword named Umar which made all Mecca tremble
 makka waalon ne kamazor musalamaanon par sitam tej kar diye jisko dekhakar mohammad sahab ne allaah se dua kii to allaah ne madeene jane kaa hukum diya
 All the Muslims started hiding in Hijrat i
e
 towards Madinah
 magar umr bade diler the apni talwaar lee dhanush baan liya, kaaba ke paas pahunch kar tawaaf kiya, do rachaat namaaz padhi phir kaha "jo apni maan ko apane par rulaanaa chahta he, apane bacchon ko anaath tathaa apni patni ko vidhwaa bananaa chahta he is jagah mili
 "nobody dared to stop Omar
 umr ne elaan karke hizrat kii
 Medina had become a new center of Islam
 san hijri islaami calendar kaa nirmaan kiya jo islam kaa panchang kehalaata he
 In 624 AD, Muslims had to fight the battle of Badr, in which Hazrat Umar also played an important role
 badr kii jang main musalamaanon kii fatah hui tathaa makka ke musharikon kii haar hui
 a year after the battle of Badr, the Meccans came together to attack Madina, the battle took place near a hill called Uhud
 jang ke shuru main muslim sena baari padi lekin kuch kaarnon vash muslimon kii haar hui
 Some people sparked the rumor that many Muslims were frightened if Muhammad Sahib was martyred, Omar also threw a sword and started saying that it is useless to live now
 kuch derbar pataa chalaa kii ye ek afvaah he to dubaara khadey hue
 After this, they lived together in Khandak's war
 umr ne muslim sena kaa netratv kiya ant main makka bhi fatah ho gaya
 Even after this, many battles had to be faced, Omar led an eye in all those wars
 8 june san 632 ko mohammad sahab duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Omar and some people did not believe that Muhammad could also have death
 ye khabar sunakar umr apane hosh kho baithe, apni talwaar nikaal lee tathaa jor-jor se kehane lage ki jisane kaha ki nabi kii maut ho gai he main uskaa sar tan se juda kar duungaa
 On this delicate occasion, then Hazrat Abu Bakr gave a Khutba meaning speech to Muslims which is very famous: phir koran kii aayat pard kar sunai: Hearing from Hazrat Abu Bakr, all the people fell on their knees, Umar also fell on his knees and accepted this great sorrow
 jab hazarat abu bakr ko laga ki unka vaqt nazadik he to unhone agle khalipha ke liye hazarat umr ko chunaa
 Omar was well known for his extraordinary will power, intelligence, political, impartiality, justice and care for the poor and underprivileged
 hazarat abu bakr ko puri tarah se umr kii shakti or unako safal hone kii kshamta ke bare main pataa tha
 The succession of Omar was thus not as troublesome as any of the others
 hazarat abu bakr ne apni mrityu ke pehle hi hazarat usmaan ko apni vasiyat likhavai ki umr unke uttaradhikari honge
 Hazrat Abu Bakr died in August 634 AD
 umr ab calipha ho gayi tathaa ek naye daur kii shruwaat hui
