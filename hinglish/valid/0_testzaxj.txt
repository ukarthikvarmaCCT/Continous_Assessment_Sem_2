 The humanities focus on understanding meaning, purpose and goal, and instead of explaining the cause of events or revealing the truth of the natural world - the explanatory method of finding "truth" - encourages the evaluation of unique historical and social events 
 apane saamaajik anuprayogon ke alaava vyaakhyaatmak kalpana itihaas, samskruti or sahitya ke pehle samajhe gaye arth kii punarvyakhya kaa mahatvapurn upkaran he
 Imagination, as part of the various tools of an artist or scholar, acts as a medium that invites audience feedback

 Answer Structuralism has problematized the understanding of humanities studies based on questions of meaning, ideology and writing

 This revelation has opened the door to criticism of the explanatory structures of the humanities
 manviki vidwata avaigyanik he or isliye apane praasangik arthon kii parivartansheel prakruti ke kaaran aadhunik vishvavidhyalay paathyakram me shaamil karne yogya nahin he
 Some, like Stanley Fish, claim that the humanities can best defend themselves by denying usability claims
 
 manviki ko bahari phaaydon jaise ki saamaajik upyogita yaa vyakti par uddatt prabhaav ke nazariye se nyaaysangat sabit karnaa tarkarahit he, fish ke anusaar yah mahatvapurn academik vibhaagon par asambhav apekshaayen daalata he
 In addition, the critical ideology that is unambiguously the result of humanities training can be acquired in other contexts
 or manviki ek tarah kii saamaajik mohar bhi nahin de sakin jo ki dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad samooh shiksha ke kaal se purv pashchimi samaaj main kamyaabi main sahaayak hoti
 Instead scholars like Fish suggest that the humanities provide a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure that is based on the collective pursuit of knowledge or according to bio-engineers who claim that one day the human-animal hybrid Generation will be possible and desirable
 Rather than engaging with old-fashioned humanities scholarship, especially transhumanists tend to focus on testing and changing the limits of our mental and physical abilities in the areas of cognitive science and bioengineering to go beyond those essential physical limits Who has bound humanity

 Judicial reforms in the context of India - The need for reforms in the Indian judiciary has been felt for decades because cheap and quick justice has been confusing overall
 adaalaton main lambit maamalon ko jaldi nipataane ke upayon ke baavjood 2 karod 50 lakh maamle lambit hai
 Experts have expressed apprehension that public confidence in the justice system is declining and there is an increasing tendency to resort to anarchy and violent crime to settle disputes

 yah samay kii maang he ki bhartiya sangh or vibhinn rajya apane sanvaidhanik dayitvon ko samajhen or nyaay pradaan karne ke tantra ko majboot banane kii disha main kuch thos kaary karen
 Other major factors include neglect to improve the infrastructure of the judicial system for the past decades, extraordinary delays in filling the vacancies of judges and very low ratios between population and judges
 nyaay tantra ke kaary nishpaadan ko sudhaarney ke liye in karkon par turant dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 The Law Commission report indicated that India is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of population and judges in the world

 According to the All India Judges Association, the Supreme Court had directed the government to increase the number of judges in a phased manner by 2012 to have 50 judges per 3 million population, which has not yet been completed
 nyaayadhishon kii anumodith rictiyon ko bharne ke liye bhi bahut kuch karne kii zarurat he

 489 jila adaalatein or 896 taluka adaalaton ke parisar main broadband samparkta uplabdh karai gai he
 Under this project, computer rooms are to be set up in all court premises in the country

 Simple and flexible procedure will be adopted in these courts so that these cases can be heard and disposed of within 90 days
 vaikalpik vivaad nivaaran kaa sahaara lene se vivachan, baatcheet, sulah or madhyasthata ke jariye lambit maamalon main kami laane main bahut madad mil sakati he
 Alternative dispute resolution as a dispute resolution mechanism has been very successful in the US and many other countries
 bharat main vivachan sulah adhinium 1996 pehle se hi he or civil prakriya samhita ko bhi sanshodhit kiya gaya he
 However, the absence of sufficient number of trained mediation and conciliation facilitates these measures
 nyaay kii mukhyadhara main vaikalpik tantra ko viksit karne ke maddenzar nyaayik adhikariyon or vakeelon ko prashikshit karne kii zarurat he
 All these measures need to be further strengthened and expanded, but the reforms will have to keep in mind the future requirements by implementing them as the spread of education will make more sections of society aware of their legal rights in future
 Litigation will increase further
 sarkaar ko samgr nyaay prakriya ko bhi dimaag main rakhana hoga jo mukademon ko nipataane main baadha daalane ke liye antaheen jirah sambandhi apil or deree karne vaale vakeelon kii bhoomika ko anumati detii he
 Despite the Code of Criminal Procedure, 2002 for bringing changes in the litigation process and civil procedure by reducing the delay in justice, the situation is still far from satisfactory
 tuchh muqadamebaaji ke masale se bhi nipatna hoga or laagat main atyadhik vruddhi karnaa iskaa ek rasta ho saktaa he
 There is a need to strengthen and modernize the police investigation mechanism which will reduce the burden on the justice system
 nyaay pradaan karne ke tantra kii sabhi jatiltaaon or sookshm antaron par sakalywaadee rup se vichaar karne se yah spasht he ki nyaay tantra main paardarshita or javabdehi sunishchit karne ke liye vartmaan sankat evam trutiyon par vichaar karnaa hoga
 It is also to be remembered that delay in justice, lack of sufficient evidence and inability to apply constitutional and legal principles in real life situations bring devastation in people's lives
 nae vidhi mantri ko nyaayik sudhaaron ke liye sab karmchaariyon ko tathaa sabhi rajya sarkaron, nyaayik evam karypalak nikaayon or baar associationon ko saath lekar chalane ke liye atirikt prayaas karne honge

 On April 7, 1795, gramme and kilogramme replaced the old terminology "gravet" and "grave"
 10 disambar, 1799 ko, metric pranali ko sthai rup se france main apanaaya gaya
 The metric system being used around the world has seen many changes today
 isane kai paramparaagat pranaaliyon ko adhikramit bhi kiya he
 Many different measurement systems were in use around the world until after World War II
 inamen se kai pranaliyaan, metric pranali kii hi bhinnak thi, jabaki anya yaa to imperium pranali yaa phir amareeki pranali par aadhaarit thim
 Then the need was proved that all these should be metered, so that a worldwide measurement system can be created

 Based on the results of this study, the Tenth CGPM decided in 1954 to derive an international system from six basic units that could provide measurements of mechanical and electromagnetic quantities as well as temperature and optical radiation
 anumodith kii gayi chah mul ikaiyaan thim meter, kilogram, sacond, ampear, degree calvin evam kandela
 In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units or the International System of Units, abbreviated as SI, originally from French: Le Système international d'unités
 The seventh parent unit, the mole or the mole, was added to the 14th CGPM in 1971

 intaraashtriya ikai pranali main ikaayiyon kaa samooh he, jiske sadash hi upsargon ke samooh bhi hai
 SI units can be divided into two subgroups: - in ikaayiyon ke saath hi To create multiples of the root unit, the SI prefix can be added
 sabhi gunak das kii purna sankhya ghaat ke hai
 For example, kilo- = sahasra or thousand milli - = thousandth part i
e
 one meter has one hazards millimeters, plus one thousand meters to one kilometer
 upsargon ko milaayaa nahin ja saktaa he
 a milligram is a millionth of a kilogram, but it will not be called a micro-kilogram

 Transfer factors are used to transfer between units

 Specific gravity is often represented in SI units, or in the context of water
 kyonki ek ghan jiske naap hai 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, uski aaytan hogi 1000 cm3, jo baraabar he 1 l ke; or jab jal se bharaa jaye, to uskaa bhaar 1 kg hota he, atev pani kii spacific gravity he 1 g / cm3 or yah 0 degree celsius par jam jaayegaa
 The metric system has received worldwide support as a means of means and daily commerce
 iskaa kaaran bahut had tak yah bhi tha ki kai deshon main rudhigat pranaaliyon main kai siddhanton ko samajhane kaa samarthy nahin thi
 At the same time, by standardizing regional changes, a world-wide system, which is universally accepted, was created
 isse anterrashtriya vyapaar ko bhi badhaava mila
 From a scientific point of view, the use of decimal can also be described as very large and very small units
