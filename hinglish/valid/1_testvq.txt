 24 janvari 2010 ko band ne yah ghoshnaa kii ki ve apane aagaamee elbum sting in di tail ke samarthan main daura karne ke baad yah kaary band kar denge
 The band started in 1965 by the band's rhythmic guitarist Rudolf Schenker
 prarambh main band kii prabhaavshaalee taal thi or shenakar khud gaate the
 In 1969, when Shankar's younger brother Michael and singer Clos Mein joined the band, the work began to work together
 In 1972, the group released their first album Lonesome Crow, with Lothar Heimberg playing the harp and Wolfgang Digini playing drums
 'lonsam kro ' ke daure ke dauraan, scorpions britain ke ubharate band uafo se jude
 daure kii samaapti ke sameep uafo ke sadasyon ne guitaravadak maaikel shenakar ko pramukh guitaravadak kii bhoomika nibhaane kaa prastaav diya, jo usne sheeghra sweekaar kar liya
 Uli Roth, a friend of the Schenker brothers, was temporarily called to complete the tour
 maaikel shenakar ke chhodane se band bikhar gaya
 1973 main, uli roth, jisane 'lonsam kro ' daure ko puraa karne main scorpions kii sahaayta kii thi, use pramukh guitaravadak kii bhoomika kaa prastaav diya gaya, lekin usne prastaav ko thukraa diya or don road band ke saath rahanaa hi pasand kiya
 Schenker eventually decided that he wanted to work with Roth but did not want to revive Scorpions' final line
 usne don road ke kuch purvaabhyas kaaryakramon main bhaag liya or antat us band main shaamil hone kaa nirnay liya jisamen roth, francis buchahoj, achim kirashaning or jurgen rosenthal shaamil the
 Roth and Buchhose explain to Rudolf Schenker to invite Klaus Mein to join, which he soon did
 jahaan band main scorpions kii tulana main don road ke adhik sadsy the, phir bhi unhone scorpions ke naam kaa upyog karne kaa nirnay liya kyonki yah german hard rock patal par suvikhyath tha or is naam se ek elbum jari kiya ja chukaa tha
 In 1974, the new Army of Scorpions released "fly to the Rainbow"
 yah elbum lonsam kro kii tulana main aghik safal hua or "spides kaming" jaise gane tathaa sheershak trek band kii dhwani sthapit karne lage
 recording ke baad achim kirashaning ne chhodane kaa nirnay liya
 Shortly after, Jürgen Roznathal also had to leave because he was enlisting in the army
 iske baad 1976 main vah german progressive rock band main shaamil honge jise aloy kaha jaataa he or unke saath teen elbum ricard karenge
 unke sthaan par belgium ke drumer rudi lanners ko liya gaya
 The band had major successes with the release of In Trance in 1975, which marked the beginning of Scorpion's long contract with German producer Dieter Dykes
 The album was a big step forward for the Scorpions and firmly established their hard rock formula, with their number of fans both at home and abroad
 "dark ladi", "robot main" or sheershak trek kaa filmakan aaj bhi chaahane waalon dwaara kaaphi pasand kiya jaataa he
 In 1976, Scorpions released Virgin Killer

 us samay tak 1978 ke madhya main, lagbhag 140 guitarvadakon kaa dhwani-pareekshan karne ke baad scorpions ne naye guitaravadak mathiyas jabs ko bhartee kiya
 After Jabs joined, Scorpions opted for Mercury Records, leaving RCA to record their next album Lovedrive
 a few weeks after his withdrawal from UFO due to drug use, Michael Shenker also returned to the group briefly during the recording of the album
 This led to three guitarists in the band
 This led to a Lovedrive album that some critics consider to be the pinnacle of his career
 "luving you sande morning", "alveej samaware", "holiday" or vaadya "coast tu coast" jaise prashansakon ke pasandida gane samavisht karata hua, madhur gaathaon ke saath mishrit hard rock gaanon kaa 'scorpions formula' dridhtaa se bandha gaya

 america chart main lavadrive apane sarvocch sthaan 55 par rahaa jisane yah siddh kiya ki scorpions ke prashansak videshon main bhi hai
 After the album was completed and released, the band decided to keep Michael with them, forcing Jabs to leave
 haalanki daure ke kuch saptahon ke baad, madhpan kii sthiti se ubhar rahe maaikel ne kai gigs chhod diye or ek baar to vah manch par hi gir gaya or jab vah nahin baja paaya tab uski jagah jabs ko waapas laayaa gaya
 april 1979 main, france ke daure ke dauraan maaikel ke sthaan par jabs ko sthaayee rup se laayaa gaya
 In 1980, the band released Animal Magnetism with a provocative cover, this time featuring a kneeling girl and a doberman in front of the man

 Meanwhile, the band began work on their next album Blackout in 1981
 When Meen recovers, Dan Dokken is brought in to guide and assist in the singing
 Ultimately Meen is fully treated and is able to complete the album
 Blackout was released in 1982 and quickly became the best-selling album, eventually going on to celebrate platinum
 min kii aawaaj main kamajori ke koi nishaan nahin the or elbum ko acha pratisaad mila
 blassout main teen ekal safal gane the, "dynamite", "blassout" or "no van like you"
 Eventually, in 1984, when the band released Love at First Sting, the band gained rock superstars status
 Love At First Sting, inspired by the single "rock You Like a Herricken", rose to the top of the charts and reached double US platinum just months after its release
 However, with his provocative album cover, Scorpions once again stirred controversy
 This time there was a photograph of Helmut Newton in which a male was kissing the woman and there were tattoos on his naked thigh

 The album sold well, but was considered somewhat disappointing
 However, British heavy rock magazine Kerrang! Gave the album five out of five

 iske kaaran, scorpions kaa rus main prashansakon kaa acha aadhaar ban gaya or ab bhi yah puure kshetra main abhinay karne ke liye niyamit rup se jate hai
 To distance himself from the Savage amusement genre, the band split from their longtime producer and "sixth Scorpion", Dieter Dyrks, and was replaced by Keith Olsen when he returned to the studio in 1990
 The same year Crazy World was released and used a less sophisticated sound
 elbum safal hua, "wind of change" gaatha kii atyadhik safalataa se iskaa bada bhaag kaaphi prerit hua

 Neither the hard rock solo song "alien Nation" nor the saga "under the Same Sun" were close to the success of "wind of Change"
 Face the Heat had some success

 It has come there that the power of thought keeps the soul higher, so that the human-mind should be aware that all the material substances or manifestations in the whole universe are all one and they have the same variety
 bhagavadgita ne yahi bhaavana or adhik spasht rup se vyakt kii he-'vah vyakti, jo antkaal main mujhe samaran karata hua is jivan se vidaa hota he, vah mere paas aata he, isamen sanshay nahin he'
 But one thing to remember is that nothing will happen in the end only by remembering God, when the soul is overwhelmed with such emotion throughout life, then only God attains God
 aisa kaha gaya he-'vyakti mrityu ke samay jo bhi rup sochataa he, usee ko vah praapt hota he or yah tabhi sambhav he, jabaki vah jivan bhar aisa karata aayaa ho
 ' puraanon ke aadhaar par kuch nibandhon kaa aisa kathan he ki antkaal upasthit hone par vyakti ko, yadi sambhav ho to, kisi tirth-sthaan main le janaa chahie
 Shuddhittattva has quoted the Korampurana - 'A person attains salvation by dying in the waters of the Ganges, in the site or waters of Varanasi, in the Gangasagar or in its land, water or space
 ' isi arth main skandapurana main aayaa he-'ganga ke taton se ek gavyuti tak kshetra hota he, itani dur tak daan, jap evam home karne se ganga kaa hi fal praapt hota he; jo is kshetra main marataa he, vah swarg jaataa he or pun: janm nahin paata'
 He has come to Pujratnakar - 'where the Shalgramshila is there, Hari resides there; One who dies near Shalagramashila receives the supreme sacrifice of Hari
 ' aisa bhi kaha gaya he ki yadi koi anarya desh main bhi shalagram se ek kos kii duuri par marataa he, vah vaikuntha paata he
 Similarly, a person who dies in the forest of Tulsi or at the time of death in whose face Tulsidal gets Mokshapad even after committing crores of sins

 There are some assumptions about the best period of death
 shaantiparv main aayaa he- 'jo vyakti surya ke uttar disha main jane par marataa he yaa kisi anya shubh nakshatra evam muhoort main marataa he, vah sachmuch punyavan he
 'this sentiment is based on the notion of dying in Uttarayan and Dakshinayan expressed in the Upanishads
 chaandogopenishad main aayaa he- 'ab chaahe log uski antyeshti kriya karen yaa na karen, vah archi: arthath prakaash ko praapt hota he, prakaash se din, din se chandra ke ardh prakaash, usase uttarayan ke chha: maas, usase varsh, varsh se surya, surya se chandra, chandra se vidyut ko praapt hota he
 Amanav leads him to Brahm
 yah devon kaa maarg he; vah maarg, jisase brahm kii prapti hoti he
 Those who go this route do not return to human life again
 haan, ve nahin lautate
 'the same thing has come in the Chandogyopanishad, where it has been said that the householder who knows Panchagni-gya and also the Vanaprastha and Parivrajaka who believe and meditate, also go to Devayana
 or jo log gramvasi hai, yagyaparayan hai, daan-dakshinayukta hai, dhooma ko jate hai, ve dhooma se raatri, raatri se chandra ke ardh andhkaar main, usase dakshinyan ke chha: maas, usase pitrulok, usase akaash evam chandra ko jate hai, jahaan ve karmfal pate hai or pun: usee maarg se laut aate hai
 The Chandogyopanishad has indicated a third place, where insects and kites etc
 keep coming
 brihadaaranyakopenishad ne bhi devloag, pitrulok evam us lok kaa ullekh kiya he, jahaan keet, patang aadi jate hai
 The Bhagavad Gita has also said these words of the Upanishads in a subtle way - i will describe those times when devotees depart from this world to never return
 agni, jyoti, din, shukla paksh, uttarayan surya ke chha:; jab brahmagyani in kaalon main marate hai, to brahmalok jate hai
 Devotees who die in six months of Dhoom, night, Krishna Paksha, Dakshinayan Sun, go to Chandralok and return again
 is vishay main ye do maarg, jo prakaashmaan evam andhakaarmay hai, sanathan hai
 One who returns from one never returns, but one who comes from another returns
 veydantasutra ne 'prakaash', 'din' aadi shabdon ko yathashrut shabdic arth main lene ko nahin kaha he; arthath uske mat se ye margon ke lakshan yaa str nahin hai, pratyut ye un devataaon ke pratik hai, jo mritatmaon ko sahaayta dete hai or devloak evam pitrulok ke margon main unhen le jate hai, arthath ve aativaahik evam abhimaani devtaa hai
 Shankar has explained in the interpretation of Vedantasutra that when Bhishma recited Uttarayana, it should be understood from this that there is only praise for Archiradi - the one who is a Brahmistra, even if he dies in Dakshinayan, he gets the fruit of his knowledge, That is, one attains Brahm
 jab bhishma ne uttarayan kii baat johi to aisa karke unhone keval lokprasiddh prayog yaa aacharan ko manyata di or unhone yah bhi prakat kiya ki unamem yah shakti bhi thi ki ve apni ichhashakti se hi mar sakate hai, kyonki unke pita ne unhen aisa var de rakhaa tha
 Despite the words of Shankar and Vedantasutra, it has been a well-known thing that it is better to die in Uttarayana

 It is one of the sixteen or more rituals performed by the Dwijs and is performed with Vedic mantras by the views of Manu, Yajnavalkyasmriti and Jatukarnya
 ye sanskaar pehle striyon ke liye bhi hote the, kintu bina vaidic mantron ke or shudron ke liye bhi bina vaidic mantron ke
 Baudhayana Pitrimedhasutra states that there are two rites of credit for every human being and they are the birth rites and the deceased rites
 dah sanskaar tathaa shraadh aadi aahitagni evam smartagni ke liye bhinn-bhinn ritiyon se hote hai, tathaa un logon ke liye bhi jo shrout yaa smart koi agni nahin rakhte

 The five Suktas of the Rigveda are translated as follows before the Shrutasutras, Grihyasutras and the later deeds mentioned in the later texts
 in sookhton kii richaayen bahudhaa sabhi sutron dwaara prayukt hui hai or unka prayog aaj bhi antyeshti ke samay hota he or unamem adhikansh vaidic samhitaon main bhi paayi jaati hai
 Indian and Western commentators have interpreted and interpreted these mantras in various ways
 rugveda main pratham sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the second sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - rugveda main tritiy sookt kaa varnan is prakaar he- The description of the fourth sukta in the Rigveda is as follows - Except for three to six mantras of this sukta, other mantras do not throw light on the funeral, so we will translate only four mantras

 gautam dharmasutra ne vyavastha di he ki un logon kii na to antyeshti kriya hoti he, na ashauch hota he or na jal-tarpan hota he or na pindadaan hota he, jo krodh main aakar mahaprayan karte hai, jo upwas se yaa agni se yaa vish se yaa jal-pravesh se yaa phaansi lagaakar latak jane se yaa parvat se kudakar yaa ped se girakar aatmahatya kar lete hai
 Haradatta has quoted three verses from the Brahma Purana saying that those who die from Brahman-curse or abstinence or those who are impure, find such a speed
 kintu angira kaa kathan he ki jo log asaavadhaanee se jal yaa agni dwaara mar jate hai, unke liye ashauch hota he or udakkriya kii jaati he
 , Where there is a list of people who do not have cremation
 mahabharat main antyeshti karm kaa bahudhaa varnan hua he, yatha adiparv main pandu kaa dah-karm; striparv main dron kaa dah-karm; anushaasanparv main bhishma kaa dah-karm; mausalparv main vasudev kaa, striparv main anya yoddhaon kaa tathaa ashramavasikaparv main kunti, dhritarashtra evam gandhari kaa dah-karm varnit he
 It has come in Ramayana that Dasaratha's pyre was made of sandalwood and it had aguru and other fragrant substances; There were also aromatic woods of simple, padmak, cedar etc
 Kausalya and other women joined the funeral procession in shibikas and other trains according to their position
 yadi aahitagni videsh main mar jaae to uski asthiyaan mangaakar kaale mrigcharm par failaa di jaani chahie or unhen maanav-aakaar main sazaa dena chahie tathaa rooyee evam ghrit tathaa shrout agniyon evam yatraaon ke saath jala daalana chahie
 If the bones cannot be found, the sources have made the arrangement based on Aitareya Brahmana and other ancient texts, that a man-putt should be made from 360 leaves of Palash on a black antelope and tie it with wool formulas
 us par jal se mishrit jau kaa aataa daal dena chahie or ghrit daalkar mrit kii agniyon evam yajyapatro ke saath jala daalana chahie
 The Brahma Purana has also given similar rules and declared Ashoka of three days
 aparark dwaara uddhrut ek smriti main palash kii pattiyon kii sankhya 362 likhi hui he
 These leaves should be decorated in the following manner with the opinion of Boudhayan Pitramidasutra and Gautam Pitramidasutra; 40 for the head, 10 for the neck, 20 for the chest, 10 for the abdomen, 70 for the feet, 10 for the toes, 50 for both arms, 10 for the fingers of the hands, 8 for the penis, 8 for the penis and scrotum
 12 for yahi varnan satyasarh shrautasutra main bhi he
 There is no consensus among those numbers of Palash Patra in the sources and memories, which are arranged for different organs
 aparark dwaara uddhrut ek smriti main sankhya yon he-sir ke liye 32, gardan ke liye 60, nitamb ke liye 20, donon haathon ke liye 20-20, anguliyon ke liye 10, andakoshon ke liye 6, ling ke liye 4, jaanghon ke liye 60, ghutanon ke liye 20, pairon ke nimna bhaagon ke liye 20, pair ke anguuthon ke liye 10
 By the opinion of Jatukarnya, if the son cannot know anything about his father who has gone abroad for 15 years, then he should burn the effigy
 puttal jalaane ko akruti dahan kaha jaataa he
 Jupiter has spoken about this for 12 years
 vaikhansasmartasutra ne akritidahan ko faldaayak karm mana he or ise keval shav yaa asthiyon kii aprapti tak hi simit nahin mana he
 Shuddhiprakash has quoted the Brahma Purana saying that Aakritahana should not be confined to Ahitagni only, this karma is also for those who have not performed Shruta Agnihotra
 is vishay main aahitagniyon ke liye ashauch 10 dinon tak tathaa anya logon ke liye keval 3 dinon tak hota he
 In the Satyasadha Shrutasutra, Boudhayan Pitrimedasutra and Garuda Purana, such a system has been given that if a person who has gone abroad returns after shaping, that is, a person who is deemed dead returns to a living state, he is taken out by dipping in a pool filled with melted butter; He is given a bath again and all rites are performed from caste work
 iske uparant usko apni patni ke saath pun: vivaah karnaa hota he, kintu yadi uski patni mar gayi he to vah duusari kanya se vivaah kar saktaa he or tab vah pun: agnihotra armbh kar saktaa he
 Some sources have provided that if Ahitagni's wife dies before he can, he can either burn it with shroteagni or keep it in a fire filled with cow dung or in three thalias, soon by the fire produced by the burning weeds
 Can burn manusmriti kaa kathan he ki yadi aahitagni dwij kii savarna evam sadaacharini patni mar jaye to aahitagni pati apni shrout evam smart agniyon se use yajyapatro ke saath jala saktaa he
 After that, he can marry again and start Agnihotra
 vishwaroop aahitagni ke vishay main kathak-shruti ko uddhrut kar kaha he ki yadi koi vyakti apni patni kii mrityu ke uparant bhi ve hi puraani shrautagniyaan rakhata he to ve agniyaan us agni ke samaan apavitra maani jaati hai, jo shav ke liye prayukt hoti hai or usne itnaa jod diya he ki yadi aahitagni kii kshatriya patni uske purv mar jaye to uskaa dah bhi shrautagniyon se hi hota he
 This theory is opposed to the views of other commentators, but he has taken the 'savarna' used in Manusmriti as an example only because not doing so will lead to sentence discrimination
 at: brahman patni ke atirikt kshatriya patni ko bhi manyata di gai he
 Some memories have written that Ahitagni can perform his Agnihotra even in a widower form and perform Yajnadi by making a wife's gold or Kush statue, as Rama did
 jab grihasth apni mul patni ko shrautagniyon ke saath jalaane ke uparant pun: vivaah nahin karata he or na pun: naveen vaidic agniyaan rakhata he to vah marane ke uparant saadhaaran agniyon se hi jalaayaa jaataa he
 If the householder does not remarry, he can burn the corpse of his dead wife in the fire emanating from the aranis
 yadi aahitagni pehle mar jaye to uski vidhwaa araniyon se utpann agni se jalaayee jaati he
 When the wife is cremated, there is no recitation of the mantra called 'asmatvamabhijatosi'
 keval sadaacharini evam pativrata stri kaa dah-karm shrout yaa smart agni se hota he
 According to Ritu and Baudhayana Pitrumedhasutra, the widow and widow are cremated by the fire called kapal, the brahmachari and the Yeti is born from the fire, the virgin girl and the unborn boy are born from the straw
 yadi aahitagni patit ho jaae yaa kisi prakaar se aatmahatya kar le yaa pashuon yaa sarpon se bhidakar mar jaae to uski shrautagniyaan jal main phenk deni chahie, smart agniyaan chauraahey yaa jal main phenk deni chahie, yajyapatro ko jala daalana chahie or use saadhaaran agni se jalaana chahie
 Manusmriti, Yajnavalkyasamriti, Parasramadhaviya, Vishnu Dharmasutra, Brahmapuran should cover the womb, fetus, dead baby and toothless infant covered with cloth
 choti avasthaa ke bacchon ko nahin jalaana chahie, kintu is vishay main pracheen smritiyon main avasthaa sambandhi vibhed paaya jaataa he
 Parskar Grihyasutra, Yajnavalkyasmriti, Manusmriti, Yama etc
 have arranged that children within the year should be buried outside the village in a clean place away from the crematorium
 aise bacchon ke shavon par ghrit kaa lep karnaa chahie, un par chandanalep, pushp aadi rakhane chahie, na to unhen jalaana chahie or na jal-tarpan karnaa chahie or na unka asthi-chayan karnaa chahie
 Relatives cannot go together
 yama ne yamasookt ke paath evam yama ke sammaan main stutipth karne kii vyavastha di he
 Manusmriti has given some alternative arrangements, such as watering can be done for children with teeth or naming-sanskrit children, ie there can be cremation of such children
 at: do varsh se kam avasthaa ke bacchon kii antyeshti ke vishay main vikalp he, arthath namakaran evam daant nikalne ke uparant aise bachche jalaaye yaa gaade ja sakate hai
 But in doing this it is not necessary to go with all the dead bodies
 yadi baccha do varsh kaa ho yaa yadi adhik avasthaa kaa ho, kintu abhi upanayan sanskaar nahin hua ho to uskaa dahakarm loukik agni se avashya hona chahie or maun rup se jala dena chahie
 Chudakaran with the opinion of Laugakhi - Sanskrit children should have the same kind of funeral
 vaikhansasmartasutra ne kaha he ki 5 varsh ke ladke tathaa 7 varsh kii ladki kaa dahakarm nahin hota
 After Upanayana, there is cremation like Ahitagni, but Yajnapatras do not have right and mantra
 boudhayanpitrumedhasutra ne vyavastha di he ki chudaakaran ke purv mrit bacchon kaa shavadah nahin hota, kumari kanyaon evam upanayan rahit ladakon kaa pitrumedh nahin hota
 He has also arranged that children without teeth are buried with 'om' and children with teeth are buried with vyahtriyas
 mitakshra ne niyamon ko nimna rup se diya he-'namakaran ke purv keval gaada jaataa he, jal-tarpan nahin hota; namakaran ke uparant teen varsh tak gaadna yaa jalaana vikalp se hota he; teen varsh se upanayan ke purv tak shavadah evam tarpan maun rup se hota he; yadi teen varsh ke purv chudaakaran ho gaya ho to marane par yahi niyam lagu hota he
 After the Upanayana, the cremation of the dead is done by temporal fire, but the manner is the same as that prescribed for Ahitagni

 unhone yah bhi bataaya he ki ishwar satya he or manushya ko achche kaary karne chahie taaki paramatma ke darbar main use lajjit na hona pade
 Guru Nanak has said in one of his books that Pandits read pothi, but do not understand the idea
 dusron ko upadesh dete hai, isse unka maaya kaa vyapaar chalata he
 His words are false, he wanders into the world
 inhen sabad ke saar kaa koi gyaan nahin he
 These pundits are still in debate
 guru arjuna dev to yahan tak kehete hai ki paramatma vyapak he jaise sabhi vanaspatiyon main aag samaayi hui he evam doodh main ghi samaaya hua he
 In the same way, the light of the divine is prevalent in everyone, the divine is spread in all its parts
 sikh dharm ko majboot or maryadasmpann banane ke liye guru arjuna-dev ne aadi granth kaa sampadan karke ek bahut bada aitihaasik evam shaashvat kaary kiya
 He also honored the compositions of 15 saints and 14 creators with five Sikh Gurus in the Adi Granth
 in paanch guruon ke naam hai- guru nanak, guru angaddev, guru amardaas, guru ramdaas or guru arjunadev
 Guruji showed his benevolent humanist vision by storing the speech of 15 saints in Shaikh Farid, Jayadeva, Trilochan, Sadhana, Namdev, Veni, Ramananda, Kabir, Ravidas, Pipa, Saitha, Dhanna, Bhikhan, Parmanand and Surdas
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone haribans, balha, mathura, gaynd, nalh, bhall, salh bhikkha, kirat, bhai maradaana, sundardaas, raai balwand evam satta duum, kalsahaar, jaalp jaise 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko aadigranth main sthaan dekar unhen ucch sthaan pradaan kiya
 While doing this amazing work, no limitation of religion, caste, region and language was created in front of Guru Arjun Dev
 unhen maaloom tha in sabhi guruon, santon evam kaviyon kaa saanskrithik, vaicharik evam chintanparak aadhaar ek hi he
 It is noteworthy that when Guru Arjunadeva completed the editing work of Adigranth in 1604 AD, then the first five gurus had the works in it
 iske baad guru govind singh ne apane pita guru teg bahadur kii vaani shaamil karke aadigranth ko antim rup diya
 There are a total of 778 posts of 15 saints in the adi-granth
 inamen 541 kabir ke, 122 shaikh farid ke, 60 namdev ke or 40 sant ravidaas ke hai
 One to four positions of other saints have been placed in the Adi Granth
 gauratlab he ki aadi granth main sangrahit ye rachanaayen gat 400 varshon se adhik samay ke bina kisi parivartan ke puri tarah surakshit hai
 But the former Guru Gobind Singh, before his death, appointed Guru Granth Saheb for the spiritual guidance of all Sikhs and the entire Khalsa Panth for 'worldly direction' as 'guru Pad'
 us samay aadigranth guru sahab ke rup main sweekaar kiya jane laga
 Guru Gobind Singh initiated people of all religions and castes into the guru-shishya-tradition to make Sikhism a classic
 unhone aane vaali shatabdiyon ke liye is nae manushya kaa srijan kiya
 This new human being is not always divided into castes and religions, is always committed to the protection of religion, human and country
 sabko saath lekar chalane kii yah sancharana, nihsandeh, sikh maanas kii thati he
 Then, the ultimate goal of Sikhism is human welfare
 kadaachit isi maanav-kalyaan kaa sabak sikhaane ke liye guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko ek lambaa patr likhaa tha, jisamen ishwar kii stuti ke saath-saath aurangzeb ke shashan-kaal main ho rahe anyaay tathaa atyaachaar kaa maarmik ullekh he
 In this letter, the pretext of doing righteous deeds and not shedding the blood of innocent subjects, cracking under the guise of religion and God and warning for lies and like a warrior, is a war to fight in the battlefield
 kaha jaataa he ki is patr ko padhakar aurangzeb kii runh kaanp uthi thi or iske baad vah adhik samay tak jivit nahin rahaa
 Even his inner desire to meet Guruji could not be fulfilled
 yah koi shrey lene-dene vaali baat nahin he ki sikh guruon kaa sahaj, saral, sada or swaabhaavik jivan jin mulyon par aadhaarit tha, nishchay hi un mulyon ko unhone paramparaagat bhartiya chetana se grahan kiya tha
 According to the demand of the country, time and circumstances, he had deeply influenced the political, social, religious, economic and cultural life of the then by changing his personality
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The Sikh Gurus gave a new direction to the religion and social order of their time
 unhone bhakthi, gyaan, upasna, aadhyatm evam darshan ko ek sankeern daayre se nikaalkar samaaj ko us tabake ke bich pahunchaa diya, jo isse purnat: vanchit the
 This awakened the self-realization of the people and a new vision and awareness arose in them, they started recognizing the self-realized experience
 is prakaar nirgun niraakaar param shakti kaa pravaah prakhar evam twarit rup se praapt hua
 Another peculiarity of Sikhism is that Sikh Gurus talked about human beings venturing into life, achieving happiness while earning and attaining God by meditating
 unka maananaa tha ki parishram karanevaala vyakti sabhi chintaaon se mukt rahata he
 Guru Nanak has even said that the person who earns hard work and does some charity in it, he recognizes the right path
 sikh guruon dwaara prarambh kii gai ‘lungar’ pratha vishvabandhutv, maanav-prem, samanta evam udaartaa kii anyatra na pai jane vaali misaal he
 Sikh Gurus also established cultural and moral values that never fade
 unhone apane darshanik evam aadhyatmik chintan se bhaanp liya tha ki aane vaala samay kaisaa hoga
 Therefore, he insisted on alternative thinking against blind copying
 shaareerik-abhyaas evam vinodashiltaa ko jivan kaa aavashyak ang mana
 Punjabi folk songs, folk dances and Hola Mahalla are the inspiration-seeds of the Sikh Gurus at the core of their performance
 in lokgeeton evam lok nrityon kii jaden punjab kii dharti se footati hai or logon main thirakan paidaa karti hai
 Bhangra and Giddha are the cultural pride of Punjab, whose beats are often heard in India and abroad
 punjabi samskruti rashtriyata kaa merudand he
 There is unity in its soul, sympathy, cooperation, compassion and human love in its blood
 punjabi samskruti aadmi se jodatii he or uski pahchaan banaati he
 a Punjabi wandering in any corner of the world is one of its own miniature Punjab
 prayek sikh kii apni swatantra chetana he, jo jivan-sambandhi samasyaon ko apane hi prakaash main sulajhane ke uddeshy se gambheer rup se vichaar karti ai he
 Take the history of the Sikh Gurus, they did not formulate the imperialist concept at all, instead they kept on looking at the humanitarian world through cultural, religious and spiritual harmony
 azaadi ke purv, bharat-paak vibhaajan evam iske baad kai dashakon main punjab main samay-samay par aae hinsaatmak-zalazalon evam nirdayee vidhwanson ke baavjood is dharti ke logon ne apana shantipurna astitv banaae rakhaa he
 The guidance has been flashes
 sikhon ke das guru he
 Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is a religious book of Sikhs
 sikhamat kii shuruyaat hi "ek" se hoti he
 The Sikh scriptures only interpret "one"
 ek ko nirankaar, parbrahm adik gunavachak naamon se janaa jaataa hai
 The form of Nirankar is mentioned at the beginning of Sri Gurugranth Sahib, which is called 'mool Mantra' in common language
 takreeban sabhi dharm isi "ek" kii aradhana karte hai, lekin "ek" kii vibhinn avasthaaon kaa zikr va vyakhya shri guru granth sahib ji main di gai he wo apane aap main niraali he
 The living soul which is formless, has only 4 qualities of Nirankar
 baaki chaar gun praapt karte hi jeev aatma vaapis nirankaar main samaa jaati he, lekin usko praapt karne ke liye jeev aatma ko khud ko gurmat ke gyaan dwaara samajhnaa zaruri he
 It is called "soul contemplation" in Sikhism
 aatma kaa niraakaari swaroop man, chit, surat, budhi, mati adik kii jaankaree sikh dharm ke mul sikhyaon main di jaati he
 By understanding these activities, a person can understand himself
 sikh dharm kii shuruyaat hi aatam gyaan se hoti he
 What is soul? Where did it come from? Why does it exist? What to do is Etihadi is taught by special Sikh propaganda of spirituality
 aatma ke vikaar kya hai, kaise vikaar mukt ho
 The soul itself is part of the nirankar
 iskaa gyaan karavaate karavaate nirankaar kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Sikhism does not believe in personnel philosophy
 anya dharmo kaa kahana he ki prabhu ko ache karm pasand hai or bure karmo waalon ke saath parameshwar bahut bura karata he
 But according to Sikhism, humans cannot do anything themselves
 insaan sirf sochane tak simit he karata vahi he jo "hukum" main he, chaahe wo kisi garib ko daan de rahaa ho chaahe wo kisi ko jaan se maar rahaa ho
 The same thing was made firm by Shri Gurugranth Sahib at the beginning: isi liye gurmat main paap punya ko nahin man jaataa
 If a person performs an action, then that difference should be done by mixing voice with soul
 yahi karn he kii gurmat karm cond ke viruddh he
 Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji tried to liberate the common people from the clutches of the contractors, pandas, pirs etc
 of religion by removing the prevalent practices, superstitions, shabby stereotypes and hypocrisy in the Indian society of his time
 nimnlikhit chaar 'padaarth' maanav ko apane jeevankaal main praapt karnaa anivaary he : Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha were not taken into four substances
 shri guru gobind singh ji kehete hai: In Sikhism, devotees and Satgurus have called Nirankar without formlessness
 kyonki sansaarik padaarth to ek din khatm ho jate hai lekin parabrahm kabhi nahin marataa
 That is why it has been called a famine
 yahi nahin jeev aatma bhi aakar rahit he or is sharir ke saath kuch samay ke liye bandhi he
 Its existence is without the body, which is far from the intelligence of the common man
 yahi karn he kii sikhamat murti puja ke sakht khilaaf he
 Satgurus and devotees have treated idol worshipers with blind, animal etiquette words
 us kii tasviir bane nahin ja sakati
 Not only this, any worldly material like Kabar, historical things of devotees and Satgurus, idols are worshiped against the basic principles of Sikhs
 dharmik granth kaa gyaan ek vidhi jo nirankaar ke desh kii taraf lekar jaati he, jiske samaksh sikh natmastak hote hai, lekin dharmik granthon kii puja bhi sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 In Sikhism, every living being is called an avatar
 har jeev us nirankaar kii ansh he
 Any panchi, animal, tree, etc
 are incarnations in the world
 maanush kii yoni main jeev apana gyaan puraa karne ke liye avatarit hua he
 The person is not worshiped in Sikhism as "god forbid that everyone is alive, giving, AK God"
 tamaam avatar ek nirankaar kii shart par puure nahin utarate koi bhi ajooni nahin he
 This is the reason that Sikhs do not consider anyone as God
 haan agar koi avatar gurmat kaa upades karata he to sikh us upadesh ke saath zarur jude rahete hai
 As Krishna has said in the Gita that soul does not die and death does not happen, Sikhism agrees with this, but further Krishna has said that karma is the religion from which Sikhism does not agree
 pigambar wo he jo nirankaar kaa sandesh athwa gyaan aam lokai main baante
 As it is said in Islam that Muhammad is the last prophet, it is said among the Sikhs that "every jug jug bhakta upaaya"
 bhakt same dar same paidaa hote hai or nirankaar kaa sandesh logon tak pahunchaate hai
 Sikhism agrees with "la ilaha ill Allah" but only Muhammad is not Rasul Allah
 arjuna dev ji kehete hai "dhur kii bani ai, tin sagali chint mitaai", arthath mujhe dhur se vaani ai he or meri sagal chintaaen mit gai hai kionki jisaki taak main main baitha tha mujhe wo mil gaya he
 Originally, the statement of devotees Avam Satguru was done by Satguru Arjun Dev Ji, which is called Adi Granth, is famous as a religious text of Sikhs
 This book is a true sermon of 36 devotees and it is astonishing that 36 devotees have lectured Nirankar in equal view
 There is no difference in a word
 Along with the Sikh Adi Granth, the Dasam Granth, which is the collection of the speech of Satguru Gobind Singh Ji, is also considered
 This book is under the Khalsa
 But taking knowledge of Adi Granth in the original form is the best practice for Sikhs
 yahi nahin sikh har us granth ko sammaan dete hai, jisame gurmat kaa upadesh he | Adi Granth or Adi Guru Granth or Guru Granth Sahib or Adi Guru Darbar or Pothi Sahib, is a religious book compiled by Guru Arjun Dev, which records the experiences of the spiritual life of 36 devotees
 The Adi Granth is said to be because of the knowledge of "adi" in it
 According to the chanting, "truth" is the beginning
 The scripture that makes it known is called Adi Granth
 Its references are within the text itself
 However, Vidwan says that because this book was not made by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, this is why it is an Adi Granth and Satguru Gobind Singh Ji climbed the 9th palace, hence this Adi Granth was called Jagan Guru Granth
 bhakton evam satguruon kii vaani potheon ke rup main satguru arjuna dev ji ke samay mojood thim | bhai gurdas ji ne yah granth likhaa or satguru arjuna dev ji disha nirdharak bane | unhon ne apni vaani bhi granth main darj kii | yah granth kii kai nakle bhi taiyaar hui | 1430 pages of Adi Granth were standardized by the Khalsa
 dasam granth, sikhon kaa dharmagranth he jo satgur gobind singh ji kii pavitra vaani evam rachnaao kaa sangrah he
 Guru Gobind Singh ji made many compositions during his lifetime, whose small books were made
 un kii maut ke baad un kii dharm patni mata sundari kii ajna se bhai mani singh khalsa or anya khalsa bhaaiyon ne guru gobind singh ji kii sari rachnaao ko iktha kiya or ek jild main chadha diya jise aaj "dasam granth" kaha jaataa he
 Simply put, Guru Gobind Singh ji composed and Khalsa edited
 dasam granth kaa satkar sari sikh kaum karti he
 The Vāsānī of the Dāsam Granth such as Jaap Sahib, Tāva Parsād Savaiye and Chopai Sahib are part of the daily Sajda, Nitnem, of the Sikhs, and these Vanyas are read while making Khande Bate's Pahol, which is called Amrit Chakna in the common language
 takhat hajur sahib, takhat patna sahib or nihang singh ke gurudwaron main dasam granth kaa guru granth sahib ke saath parkash hota hai or rose hukamname bhi liya jaataa he
 The attacks of Sarabloh Granth and Bhai Gurdas are doubtless creations
 However, the Khalsa Mahima is adorned in the Sarbloh Granth which is the authenticated work of Satguru Gobind Singh, the rest of the Srabloh text contains a karma scandal, a person worshiping itiyadi vizhi mojud who is against the basic principles of the Sikhs
 The words of Bhai Gurdas are recorded in the words of idol worship, karma doctrine etc

 The name Linlithgow comes from the Old British lynn llaith cau meaning "lake in the moist valley"
 vastut: "linlithgo" kaa matlab lok se hi he, nagar ko sirf lithgo ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 The surnames of many people here are also Lithgos
 puraani kahavatein is naam ko galic bhashaa ke liath gu yani "halkaa kaala kutta" se bhi jodti hai
 The town has a generally east-west orientation and is centered on what used to be the main edinburgh-stirling road; this now forms the main thoroughfare called the High Street
 Plots of farmed land, known as rigs, ran perpendicular to the High Street and comprised much of the town's development until the 19th century
 Growth was restricted to the north by Linlithgow Loch, and by the steep hill to the south, but, in the late 19th & early 20th centuries, development began to take place much further south of the High Street
 In the late 20th century, demand for housing saw many residential developments take place much further south, as well as spreading into new areas
 This southward development was bisected by the Union Canal and latterly the main edinburgh-glasgow railway line, To the west, Linlithgow Bridge used to be a somewhat distinct village with its own identity, but in the latter half of the 20th century it was enveloped in the expansion of the main town and today the distinction between them is hard to make out
 In Westminster, Linlithgow has been a strong stronghold of the Labor Party

 Nevertheless, BSNL is a legacy operator and being a government department, it faces a lot of criticism due to weak customer service
 Recently there has been a lot of development in the work of BSNL, still it is less than the expectations of the industry
 This, mostly being semi-educated or uneducated, is the main reason for weak customer service
 Despite the limitations of establishing heritage, management is taking a hard stand for the growth of the organization - and is ready to give the competition a tough fight - the Indian PSU Despite the fact that in the coming years, the work force profile is very high and about 25% of the current workforce will take leave in 2010, par, bi es en el main snaatak injinir ke bharti se iske kaaryashakti main gahanta se vruddhi kii aashaa he lekin beasenel yuva bharti ejeeniyar jaise kaam kaa vaataavaran main yogya nahin he Access deficit fee has been cut by 37% by TRAI

 In the context of historical linguistics, any change in the sound of a language that changes the number or distribution of the phonemes of that language is called phonetic change or sound change
 bhashaa ko gatisheel or parivartansheel mana jaataa he
 In every language, the process of internal change goes on continuously
 yah parivartan yaa badlaav sabhi bhashik staron jaise- dhvanyatmak, roopaatmak, arthathmak aadi par jari rahata he
 Of all these changes, voice changes are mainly the most active
 da
 bholanath tiwari ne swaroop ke aadhaar par dhwani parivartan ko nimnlikhit virgon main rakhaa he- Sound changes occur for both historical and geographical reasons
 'agni' se 'aag' shabd kaa bananaa dhwani parivartan kaha jayega
 In the corresponding words, gradually the sound changes have resulted in the creation of words
 isi prakaar anya bhashaaon se sampark se bhi bhashaa main dhwani parivartan hota he
 When there is a geographical expansion of a language, it starts leaving the form of its native dialect
 vah aitihaasik kram se kalantar main itani badal jaati he ki uskaa swaroop uske mul bhugolic yaa sthaneey rup se bilkul bhinn ho jaataa he
 For example, due to the geographical expansion of Hindi, it moved out of its original local Khadi dialect and became associated with the language from Rajasthani, Bhojpuri, Braj, Awadhi, Maithili and changed into a language
 dhwani parivartan ke anek kaarnon main se ek uccharan main suvidha yaa praytn-laghav ko pramukh mana jaataa he
 Often, when pronouncing many words, there is a tendency to pronounce difficult sounds coming in them by turning them into easy sound for convenience
 jaise- sanyukt vyanjan ke uccharan main kathinaayee hone par aasaani se shabd kaa uccharan karne ke liye uske ek vyanjan kaa lop kar diya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye, 'dwi' kaa 'do', yaa 'sneh' kaa 'neh' uccharan
 Apart from this, pronunciation is also facilitated by the use of easy sounds or by changing the order of sounds
 jaise 'brahman' kaa 'bramhan' uccharan
 Similarly, due to the sounds around you, any sound gets changed by use
 jaise- yadi kisi aghosh vyanjan ke aasapaas kori ghosh vyanjan ho to vah ghosh ho jaataa he
 Such as 'kangan' of 'kankan' or 'saag' of 'shak'
 isi prakaar, kisi duusare shabd se samanta ke kaaran kuch shabdon kii dhvaniyaan unheen ke samaan bole jane ke kaaran parivartit ho jaati hai
 For example, the word 'ekadash' in Sanskrit came to be spoken as 'ekadash' on the analogy of 'dwadash'
 in aitihaasik parivartanon ke atirikt bhashaaon ke aapasi sampark ke kaaran bhi dhwani parivartan hote hai
 When some words of one language are adopted in another language, there is a sound change
 udhaaharan ke liye 'mumbari' marathi kaa tatsam rup he
 Which is changed to 'bombay' in Hindi and 'bombay' in English
 yah dhwani parivartan bhashaa bhed yaa bhugolic parivartan ke kaaran hua he
 Sound changes also occur due to geographical expansion
 kshetra badalane se bhashaa main badlaav aata he
 There is also a lot of change in the pronunciation of the sounds of a language whose geographical spread is from the country
 dhwani parivartan ke in parivartanon ko ek hi dhwani rup ke vaikalipak rup kaha ja saktaa he
 Dhaunrabantha is a village in Raigarh district under the Chhattisgarh state of India in the Sarangarh division
 sahan-seemaa abhiyantriki kaa mahatvapurn avadharana he
 It tells how much variation or deviation from a fixed value of a physical amount of a system or product is expected / acceptable
 gyatavya he ki kisi bhi utpaadan prakriya main koi kisi parameter kaa nirpeksh maan praapt nahi kiya ja saktaa balki isamen kuch vichlan sambhav he
 For example, to say that the diameter of such a hole should be 2 cm - is incomplete in itself because a hole of exactly 2 cm diameter cannot be formed by any means or there is no complete equality between many holes
 usamen kuch na kuch truti yaa paraspar vichlan avashya rahegi chaahe vah kitna hi kam kyon na ho
 The amount of deviation depends on how many correct tools are used; Which method was used; How much control was placed on external disruptions; How many skilled workers made it etc
 at: tolerance kaa nimnlikhit main se koi bhi arth ho saktaa he: The dimensions, properties, etc
 of a process or product do not have any special effect on its functioning due to some limited amount of variation from the set value
 tolerance is vyaavhaarik baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nirdisht kiye jate hai ki koi bhi prakriya / padaarth / utpaada purnatah dosharahit nahin hota or duusari taraf yah ki thodi-bahut ghat-batch se kaary par bahut bada pratikul prabhaav nahin padataa

 Despite achieving significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, English football was marked by a low scoring team in the late 80s

 Since 1888, the Football League First Division, reputed as the top level English football, lagged far behind leagues such as Serie a of Italy and La Liga of Spain in terms of attendance and revenue and many top English players went abroad
 haalanki, 1990 ke dashak kii baari aane par adhonmukh pravriti main vipareet badlaav aana shuru ho gaya tha; 1990 ke FIFA world cap main england ne semi-final tak pahunchane main safalataa hasil kii
 UEFA, the governing body of European football, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs to play in European competitions in 1990, and in January of the same year, the Taylor Report was published in which everyone was exposed to the ill effects of the Hillsborough disaster
 a costly revamp was proposed to construct stadiums with seating facilities
 television se milane vaala paisa bhi bahut zyada myne rakhata tha; footbal lig ko 1986 main ek dwivarshiya samjhaute ke liye £6
3 million mila, lekin jab 1988 main us saude kaa navinikaran kiya gaya, chaar saal main isaki keemat badhkar £44m ho gai
 The 1988 talks were the first sign of a separatist league; Ten clubs threatened to abandon it and establish a "super League", but eventually agreed to stay

 At the conclusion of the 1991 season it was proposed to establish a new league which would bring more money to the entire game
 The Founder's Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top clubs, established the basic principles for the establishment of the FA Premier League

 At that time it was argued that with the help of additional income derived from it, English clubs would be able to compete with teams from all over Europe

 This led to the break-up of the 104-year-old Football League which had until then operated four divisions; The Premier League will operate with only one division and the Football League with three divisions
