 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn

 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation

 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai

 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height

 The survey board or 'plane table' is a tool useful in surveying
 surveykshan patt ek thos samtal pradaan karata he jis par drawing, chart or maanchitr banaae jate hai
 Planetary survey is a very unique method of survey
 surveykshan kii anya adhikansh vidhiyon main prithvi kii sataha par binduon kii maap lekar, unka alag se pariklan evam aalekhan kiya jaataa he
 It is not only impossible to do the necessary diligence but also to measure and plot every desired point in a wide area for the survey
 planetebul surveykshan main yahi asaadhya adhyavsaay atyant saadhy ban gaya he
 The action of the planetabull survey is such that it can have a straightforward and accurate plotting of the relative positions of the points on the surface of the earth without actual measurement
 yaheen isaki visheshta he
 In addition, the equipment used can be cheap and simple and a caring general educated surveyor
 in aakarshak gunon ke kaaran sabhi deshon main is vidhi kaa vyapak rup se prayog hota he
 The following tools are used in this work
 planetebul yaa patal, tipai, darsh rekhi, spirit lebill tathaa talamaapi tathaa chumbakeey diksuchak 
 12 to 15 cm of ripened wood with the effect of good weather to make plantebul
 Wider and two to three cm
 75 x 60 or 60 x 50 square centimeters by adding thick strips well
 a rectangular plantable plinth is prepared
 isaki ek sataha bhalee prakaar chhilkar or randakar ekadam samtal kar di jaati he
 On the other side, a metal plate is attached to the center of the plantebul, with bangles cut to tighten the tripod
 tipai main teen pair pechon dwaara sir se jude rahete hai
 Legs can be moved loosely and the head of the tripod can be moved horizontally
 tipai ke sir ke bichobich bane chhed main planetebul ksaa ja saktaa he
 The feet can also be horizontalized by looking at the spirit label by sliding the feet
 planetebul ko kasnevaale pech ko dhilaa karke takhte ko kshaitij tal main ghumaya ja saktaa he or manachaahi sthiti main kasakar sthir kiya ja saktaa he
 Viewers 60 or 75 cm
 Long, one cm
 Thick and about five cm
 Made of wide metal or wood
 iske donon lambey kinare ekadam sidhe or ek ore ko dhaalu hote hai, jisase sidhi or sahi rekha kheenchna sambhav ho sake
 Two sightings or leaves are placed on both ends of the viewer
 ek pattee ke bich main ek zairi kati hoti he, jisamen se jhaankakar surveykshak apane lakshya ko dekhtaa he or duusari pattee ke bich ek dhaagaa pirokar donon pattiyon ke siron par taan detaa he
 One leaf is cut in a thread, the other is threaded and the threads are placed at the ends of the leaves in such a way that they fall in the same plane
 jab darsharekhi kshaitij patal par rakhaa ho to zairi or dhaagaa patal ke tal par lamb honge
 If any distant point or object is cut from the thread by peeping from the wrinkle, then the viewer will tell the direction of that point or object from the position of the observer
 yadi planetebul par kaagaj madha ho or usapar prekshak kii sthiti chinhit ha, to us samay darsharekhi kaa ekarekhi kinaaraa prekshak kii kaagaj par lagi sthiti ko sparsh karata hua rakh jaae or zairi se hokar dhaage par katati vastu yaa bindu dekhakar darsharekhi ke sparshi kinare par rekha khinch di jaae to vah prekshak kii sthiti se us vastu yaa bindu kii disharekha hogi, jise kiran kehete hai
 Repeating the same action from another position, two rays from two positions of the same point will cut together and give their correct relative position at the point of intersection
 chumbakeey diksuchak ek ytaakar, kaach ke dhakkanvaale, pital ke vaks main chumbak kii ek sui ko ek keeli par alambit karke banaate hai
 There is also a solution to stabilize the needle by lifting it from the stand
 isse planetebul ko prayek sthiti par sahi dishaao main rakhane main sahaayta milti he
 By filling the fluid in the pipe, both sides are closed in such a way that a bubble of air remains inside it
 nalee kaa aakaar halakaa vakr liye hota he
 Close it firmly in a square tube of metal so that the bulge of the curved tube is visible from the cut hole on one surface of the metal tube
 ise spirit levil yaa talamaapi kehete hai
 If the spirit level is placed on a tight frontboard on the tripod and the legs of the tripod are fixed so that the bubble is centered when the bubble is centered by placing the thermometer in any two right-sided directions
 planetebul kshaitij na hone se binduon kii khinchi gai kirane pradhanat: bahut unche yaa neeche main sthit hone se galat hongi
 Therefore, the correct relative positions of the points will not be obtained
 vargankit kaagaj par surveykshan hetu kshetra main sthit, aise vinduon kaa, jinke niamak gyaat hon, vaanchit paimaane par aalekhan kar diya jaataa he
 This paper is mounted on a plantebul
 kaagaj madhne ke kai tareeke hai
 If the survey work is of very short duration, then paper buttons are mounted on planks with pins
 yadi ek yaa do saptaah kaa surveykshan ho, jisamen kaagaj ekadam sthir rahanaa aavashyak ho, to kaagaj ke chaaron kinaaron par ek sabal patale kaagaj kii jhaalar yaa magaji lagaakar, us jhaalar ke bade bhaag ko patal par dridhtaa se chipka dete hai
 In a long-lasting survey, or in which it is necessary for the paper to be completely stable, the paper is about 15 cm from the surface
 More and longer sticks on the cloth
 phir kapadaa planetebul kii sataha par dridhtaa se khinchakar chipka diya jaataa he
 When affixing paper to a cloth is placed on a plantebulb, the classification and control points on the paper are plotted after mounting the paper on the platen
 taduparant jis kshetra main surveykshan karnaa hota he, surveykshak usamen sthit ek aise niyantran vindu par planetebul le jaataa he jo uske kaagaj par ankit ho
 Such a point is called a station
 stesan ke upar tipai ko uske pair failaakar lagbhag kshaitij rakhaa jaataa he or usapar patal kas diya jaataa he
 The tripod's legs are placed in two successive right-angled positions on it, so that the bubble is centered
 isse planetebul kshaitij ho jaataa he
 Subsequent substitution is done
 diksthaapan planetebul kii us dasha ko kehete hai jab planetebul ke chitra par ankit niyantran vinduon ko kaagaj par jodanevaali rekhaayen unheen vinduon ko prithvi par jodanevaali rekhaon ke samanaantar ho jaaen
 To achieve this condition, the surveyor performs the following actions: Imagine, the surveyor is standing on an a point on the ground with an a on the paper
 isi prakaar ek duusare vindu kii bhaumik or aalekhith sthitiyaan kramash: b or b hon, to surveykshak apane darsharekhi kaa ek kinaaraa aise rakhata he ki vah a or b par sparshi rahe, dhagewali lakshya-vedhika b kii ore or zairi vaali lakshya-vedhika a kii ore rahe
 Then he rotates the plantebul on the tripod in such a way that the point b is seen cut from the thread of the viewer
 aisi dasha praapt hone par vah planetebul kas detaa he
 In this way, the panel is set in its right directions
 is dasha main yadi darsharekhi nirdeshak dhar surveykshak kii sthiti a or kisi bhi duusare aalekhith vindu ko sparsh karti rakhi jaae to zairi se dekhne par dekhe janevaale vindu kii bhaumik sthiti dhaage par kategi
 It is worth remembering that the jhiri will always be towards the observer and the threaded observatory will be towards the observed point
 uparyukt dasha main patalchitr laakar, surveykshak apni aalekhith sthiti a vindu par apni pencil ke sahare darsharekhi kii dhar vindu ke sparshi rakhkar, anya vinduon ko zairi se agevale jharokhe main dhaage par katataa dekhtaa he or unki ore kirane khinchataa he
 He draws such rays to all the points he wants to show on the map, such as the twists and confluences of villages, rivers, roads, etc
 mode or sangam vindu hi isliye netaa he ki ruju bhaag to vah vindu milaati rekhaon se bhi bana sakat he
 This action is repeated at other stations
 isse kinhin bhi do stedhanon se di gai ek hi bindu kii kirane aapas main katkar, pratichhedan par vindu kii sahi saapeksh sthiti de dengi
 These conditions will be on the same scale as the writing of the silver
 yah patalchitran kii pratichchhed vidhi kehalaati he
 If the rays are drawn, by measuring respectively the distance of the same points and cut from the scale on the beam, the correct point is obtained
 ise surveykshan kii vikiran vidhi kehete hai
 If they are surveyed by measuring the distance, giving a point and giving a gradual rays from a station situated on the banks of things like a river, canal, road, etc
 to the invisible station, it is called a traversal survey
 kate vinduon ko rekhaon dwaara milakar surveykshak vastuon kii akritiyaan bana detaa he
 By looking at the map, he uses symbolic symbols to identify objects on the map from the ground and from the ground, so that the objects can also be differentiated into shapes
 udaahranarth, nahar, sadak, railmarg aadi ke sthaan par keval rekhaayen banengi, kintu surveykshak unhen bhinn rangon or dhangon se khinchakar dusron ko samajhane main samarth hota he
 The surveyor displays the relative heights between the points with contour lines
 iske liye patalchitran kii kriya sarvottam he
 The land is in front and the measurement, drafting and illustration activities go hand in hand
 saapeksh unchaaiyaan nikaalane ke liye natimapi kaa prayog hota he
 With this device, the observer can read the tangent of the angle formed due to the difference in height of any other point on its position
 patalchitr se us vindu kii apane se duuri nikaal saktaa he or tab us vindu kii saapeksh oonchaai nikaal letaa he
 In this way one can find the relative heights of all the points
 surveykshak kii bhinn-bhinn sthitiyon se nikaali saapeksh unchaaiyon main ekarupata rakhane ke liye unchaaiyaan kisi aadharatal se naapi jaati hai
 This base is generally considered to be the average floor of the sea measured taking into account the tide
 is tal se samaan oonchaai par sthit vinduon ko jodatii rekha ko samocch rekha kehete hai
 By pulling it, the surveyor gives an impression of height

 Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy was born in Yasnaya Polyana, a princely state about 100 miles south of Moscow

 After coming to the princely state, he made efforts to improve the condition of his peasants and conveniently presented certain conditions for them to become independent landlords, but the Assamese class was influenced by rumors of imminent independence, so they rejected the terms of Tolstoy

 1854 main tollstoy danyube ke morche par bheje gaye; vahaan se apni badali unhone sebastopol main kara lee jo krimian yuddh kaa sabase tagada morcha tha

 After returning from the yatra, he opened a school in his village Yasnaya Polyana for the children of farmers

 On behalf of the school, a magazine called "yasnaya Polyana" was also released in the name of the village, in which Tolstoy's articles published expresses very pithy views on various problems of the school and its students

 In the period from 1878 to 1885, Tolstoy remained inactive in terms of creating literary literature
 unki antarvruti maanav jivan ke rahasy kii khoj main uljhi rahi
 All of Ambakat's compositions began to seem futile to him

 The whole world had become enlightened by their ethos of faith and the recognition of Yasnaya Polyana Village had become famous as an excellent pilgrimage center

 It was during these days that he read Tolstoy's compositions and was attracted to them

 'punarutthan' naamak apane upanyaas kii samast aay unhone rus kii shantivaadee jati dukhebor logon ko rus kaa parityag kar canada main ja basane ke liye de di

 10 navambar 1910 ko apni putree eleclandra ke saath unhonen prasthaan kiya, par 22 navbanr 1910 ko maarg ke stesan astapovo main aksmaat fefde main dah hone se vahiin unka sharirant ho gaya
 His religion was very liberal and comprehensive
 tatkaaleen isai dharm ke prati unki spashtat: virdohi bhaavana thi
 From his thoughts he seems to be a kind of omnipotentist
 mrityu ko ve sharir kii antim ore avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered man as the ultimate and inevitable culmination of the body

 They considered a purposeless, thoughtless and autistic life as a kind of sin; Even he considered sexual intercourse only for the purpose of procreation
 manovaigyanik rachanaaon main fyodor dostoyevski hi tolastay ke samakaksh thaharte hai
 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he

 Its basic metal is ghanu which means hard
 sanskrit kii mul dhaatu ghanu se parvarti sanskrit main ga dhwani kaa lop ho gaya or iskaa rup bana hanuh
 Significantly, in the naming of Bhaktashiromani Hanuman, there has been the addition of this Ghanu or Hanu

 This is the Hindi word Vajra
 indra ke paas jo vajra tha vah maharishi dadhichi kii hadidyon se bana tha
 Hanuman was the son of Vanararaj Kesari and Anjani
 kesari ko rishi-muniyon ne atyant balashaali or sevaabhaavi santan hone kaa aashirwad diya
 That is why Hanuman's body was as hard as iron
 isiilie unhen vajrang kaha jane laga
 Being extremely powerful, his name became Vajrangbali which was colloquially known as Bajrangbali

 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Pythagorean theorem
 pithagoras prameya eucalidia jyamiti main kisi samakon tribhuj ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek sambandh bataane vaala prameya he
 This theorem is usually expressed as an equation in the following way- jahaan c samakon tribhuj ke karn kii lambaai he tathaa a or b anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai he
 Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician
 paramparanusaar unhen hi is prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, haalanki yah mana jane laga he ki is prameya kii jaankaree unase purv tithi kii he
 This theorem is given in the ancient Indian Buddhist Buddhist Shulbasutra
 kaaphi pramaan he ki babylon ke ganitagyon bhi is siddhant ko jaanate the
 It is also called 'boudhayan-pythagoras theorem'
 agar ham karn kii lambaai ko c or anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai ko a or b lete hai, to prameya ko nimnlikhit sameekaran ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: or, yadi c pehle se diya gaya he or ek bhujaa kii lambaai nikaalnaa ho, to nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he : or yah sameekaran samakon trikon ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek saral sambandh pradaan karata he
 The generalization of this theorem is called the 'cosine rule', with the help of which the length of the third side of any triangle can be calculated if the length of the remaining two sides and the angle between them is measured
 yah ek aisa prameya he jiske anya pramayon kii tulana main sambhavtah sarvaadhik pramaan gyaat hai 
 In the book Pythagorean Theorem, composed by Elisha Scott Loomis, 367 evidences are given
 boudhayan prameya ke adhikansh pramaanon kii tarah, yah do samroop tribhujon kii bhujaaon ke samaanupati hone ke gun par aadhaarit he
 Let ABC be a right angled triangle, in which angle c is right angled, as shown in the figure
 ham c bindu se karn par lamb daalate hai or bhujaa AB ke saath us lamb kii lambaai h hai
 This new triangle ACH is similar to our triangle ABC, because they both have right angles and a is their angle
 iskaa matlab he kii teesraa kone bhi donon tribhujon main samaan he
 On this basis, triangle CBH is also similar to ABC
 in samarupataaon se hamen do samaanupaat praapt hote hai: like tathaa They can also be written as in do samikarnon kaa sankshep karne par, In other words, the Boudhayan theorem: euclid ke tatwon main, pustak 1 kaa prastaav 47, boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit linon ke saath ek tark se sabit hota he
 A, B, c are considered the vertices of the right triangle, in which the right angle will be on A
 Drop a perpendicular from a to Karna opposite the square at the hypotenuse
 The line divides the square at the hypotenuse into two imports, each having the same area as one of the two legs being square
 aupchaarik pramaan ke liye, hamen chaar praathmik lemmata kii aavashyaktaa he: The simple idea behind this proof, which can make it easy to follow, is that the two squares above are transformed into a parallelogram of the same size, then folded and the left and right rectangles are converted to the lower squares, then continuous
 In area
 pramaan nimnanusaar he: This proof appears in Euclid's Elements as Proposition 1

 james e
 garfield ko ek upanyaas bijiy pramaan dwaara shrey diya gaya he: The entire trapezium is half of the left square, so its area = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 trikon 1 or trikon 2 prayek kshetrafal ab / 2 he
 The area of triangle 3 is c2 / 2 and it is half of the square on the hypotenuse
 lekin trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal bhi = - Hence the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 is pramaan main, karn par varg plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan ko anya do parshvon main virgon ke rup main jod sakate hai plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan
yah pramaan china se darj kii gai he
 From Euclid's proof diagram above, we can see three identical figures, each with a "triangle over a square"
 kyunki bada trikon do chote trikon se bana he, uskaa kshetrafal in do chote kaa jod he
 By analogy, the three squares are in the same ratio with each other as the three triangles and the area of the larger square is the sum of the area of the two smaller squares
 viparyay se pramaan ko chithran or anemeshan ke dwaara diya gaya he
 In this example, the area of each large square is 2
 donon main, charon samaan trikon kaa kshetrafal hataa diya gaya he
 The remaining regions, a2 + b2 and c2, are equal
 Q
E
D This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not preliminary, in the sense that it does not depend only on the most basic theory and theorems of Euclidean geometry
 vishesh rup se, jab trikon or virgon ke kshetrafal kaa sutara dena bahut aasaan he, yah sabit karne ke liye aasaan nahin he ki ek varg kaa kshetrafal uske tukdon ke kshetron kaa jod he
 In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem
 In fact, this difficulty affects all simple field-involved Euclidean proofs; For example, to get the area of a right-angled triangle involves an assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle of the same height and plane
 isi kaaran se, jyamiti ke liye swayansiddh parichay aam taur par trikon kii samanta ke aadhaar par ek or pramaan kaa prayog karata he 
 In the third graphic illustration of this Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse fits the square of the sides
 ek sambandhit pramaan yah dikhaa saktaa he kii punah sthapit bhaag mul ke samaan hai or, kyunki samaan kaa jod samaan he, kii unke kshetra bhi samaan hai
 To show that a square is the result, we have to show the length of the new sides equal to c
 Note that for this proof to work, we need to handle the way to cut a smaller square into more parts
 As the sides become smaller and smaller
 is pramaan kaa bijiy bhinnrup nimna tark dwaara pradaan kiya gaya he
 Looking at the illustration which is a large square with equal right-angled triangles at the corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle with C
 in trikon ke A-parshv kone or B-parshv kone anupoorak kone hai, nile kshetra ke prayek kone samakon hai, is kshetra ko ek varg banaate hue jiske parshv kii lambaai c he
 The area of this square is C2
 In this way the area of the whole is given: haalanki, bade varg ke parshvon kii lambaai a + B, ham uske kshetrafal kii gananaa kar sakate hai jaise 2, jo A2 + 2AB + B2 main vistaarit hota he
 The Buddhist theorem can be arrived at by studying the following diagram of how a lateral change can produce a change in the hypotenuse and using a small algorithm
 parshv a ke da main parivartan ke parinaam swarup, For a change in the similarity and difference of a triangle
 char ke viyojan par
 The result is the addition of a second term to the change in side b
 samekit detaa he When a = 0 then c = b, then b2 is "continuous"
 isliye As can be seen, this square is due to the special ratio between the changes and the sides, whereas the independent contribution of changes to the sides is the result of an amount that is not clear from geometric proofs
 is die gaye anupaat se yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he kii parshvon main parivartan parshvon se pratipanupati anupaat hai
 This differential equation suggests that this theorem is due to the related transform and its derivation is almost identical to the line integral computation
 yah maatra da or dc kramshah a or c main atyant chote parivartan hai
 But we use the real numbers Δa and Δc instead, then the ratio of their ratio is da / dc when their size is zero proximity, derivative and c / a are also close, the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangle and the result of the differential equation
 It shows
 is prameya kaa viparyaay bhi sach he: For any three positive numbers a, b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle whose sides are a, b and c and every triangle has a right angle between the sides whose lengths are a and b
 yah viparyaay euclid ke tatwon main maujuud hota he
 This can be proved by using the cosine method, or by the following proof: ABC ko ek trikon maanate hai jiske parshvon kii lambaai a, b or c he, a2 + b2 = c2 ke saath
hamen yah sabit karnaa he ki a or b parshvon ke bich ke kone samakon he
 We construct another triangle in which there is a right angle between the sides whose length is a and b
 paaythagorian prameya se, nimnanusaar he ki is trikon ke karn lambaai bhi c he
 Since the sides of the two triangles have the same length, a, b and c, they are congruent and therefore must have the same angle
 Therefore, the sides that have length a and b in our original triangle have a right angle between them
 paaythagorian prameya ke viparyaay kaa ek anumaan he kii nirdhaaran karne kaa ek saral tarika he kii yadi ek trikon samakon, obtyus, yaa acute he, is prakaar se
jahaan c ko teenon parshvon main lanbaa chunaa gaya he: a Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b and c, such as a2 + b2 = c2
 In other words, a Pythagorean triple describes the length of the sides of a right angle where the integer length of all three sides is

 The theory of Euclidean geometry derives from the Pythagorean theorem, in fact, the Euclidean type of the Pythagorean theorem stated above does not occur without Euclidean geometry

 Using the mclaurin series for this cosine function, it can be shown that the radius r reaches infinity, as it is, the spherical form of the Pythagorean theorem approaches the Euclidean form

 The Pythagoras formula is used to find the distance between two digits in a Cartesian coordinate plane and is valid if all the coordinates are real: digits {2 + 2)
 But with complex coordinates: examples, digits {and {i The distance between, 0} will remain zero, which results in redactio ad Absurdum
 This is because this formula relies on the theorem of Pythagoras, which in his Huss proofs, depends on the area
 Is su and the area depends on the triangle and on other geometric figures that separate the inside from outside, which would not have been possible if the coordinates were complex

1937 'I am disappointed in Salim
 He is quite useless at anything but collecting
 He cannot skin a bird, nor cook, nor do anything connected with camp life, packing up or chopping wood

 One of the questions he was often asked was the collection of bird specimens, especially later in life when he was known for conservation-related activism

 His own view was that the practice of wildlife conservation requires practicality and should not be based on a philosophy like non-violence
 unhone kaha ki yah moulik dharmik bhaavana bharat main pakshi adhyayan ke vikaas main ek baadha tha
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics

 Your message has gone high and low across the land and we are sure that weaver birds weave your initials in their nests, and swifts perform parabolas in the sky in your honor
 For your lifelong dedication to the preservation of bird life in the Indian subcontinent and your identification with the Bombay Natural History Society as a force for education, the World Wildlife Fund takes delight in presenting you with the second J
