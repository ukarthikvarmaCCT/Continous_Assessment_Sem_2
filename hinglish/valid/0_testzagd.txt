 paricharya kii niti ko paribhaashit karne ke shuruaati daur main jis vyakti kii dekhbhaal kii ja rahi he uske sammaan ke liye kaunsi aachaar samhita kii aavashyaktaa he iske bajaay yah ek acchhee paricharika banaanevaale gunon par kendrit tha
 For example, in the Code of International Council of Nurses, the importance of nursing in human rights is clarified to the latest from the Nurses Council International Code
 haalanki nursing-aachaar medical-aachaar se bhi mail khaataa hai, vahaan kuch antar he
 The focus of nursing ethics is a developing relationship on care and this gap creates some gaps
 For example, it is a favor to well establish the principle of traditional medical ethics
 jabaki, paaramparik chikitsa naitikta kii anumati detaa he paternalism ke zariye, jis drushtikon ke saath naitikta nursing sangat hoga nahin he
 The reason for this is that nursing theory is an attempt at a collaborative relationship with personal care
 swaittata jor detii he ke liye sammaan or paryaavaran par unke niyantran vikalp or badhaava dene ke dwaara kii garima ko banaae rakhane ke liye rogi ko aamtaur par dekha jaataa he
 This paternal practice where the health professional chooses the best treatment from their point of view is in the person's interest or vice versa
 bhed kii ek alag kone se jaanch kii ja sakati he
 In spite of some of the subjects moving more towards the binding steps, there was a policy of ethics to be pursued in the interest of continuing on the basis of consistent morality so that nursing and ethics could be followed
 yah apane adhivaktaaon dwaara mana jaataa he ise karne ke liye siddhanton se sambandhon par adhik dhyaan kendrit he or isliye adhik sahi nursing main dekhbhaal ke sambandh ko pratibimbit anya naitik vichaaron se adhik he
 Nurses try to protect their dignity, which is under their protection
 siddhant naitik mukhyadhara main padon kii, is swaittata ke liye sammaan ke ek hone ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 After this people will be able to decide their treatment
 baaki chizon kii tarah abhyaas kii suchit sahmati nurson dwaara samaanit kii jaani chahie
 However, most of the debate is on those cases in which people are unable to take their treatment choices due to mental illness which hurts their decision making power
 ek tarah se swaittata banaae rakhane ke liye pitrusulabh anuchit he likhane ke liye ek vyakti ko agrim nirdesh, ve kaise baherisancha paternalism chaahate hai taaki unako suchit kiye bagaiyr ilaaj main kiya ja sake ke liye sakasham hone kii ghatana unhen nahin pasand, taaki unhen anuchit parhez na ho
 Another topic is privacy and this is a very important principle in nursing ethics
 yah jahaan vyakti kii jaankaree ke bare vyakti kii anumati ke baad hi dusron ke saath saajha kiya jaataa he, jab tak yah mahasoos kiya jaataa he ki jaankaree ke jivan ke sangrakshan ke rup main karnaa chahie is tarah ke shulk ke saath ek ucch anupaalan karne ke liye saajha kiya jaataa he
 
 kisi ko bhi jaankaree dene se pehle is charchaa par bahes kerani chahie kii sach kis tarah bataaya jaae us vyakte ko jo, sangrakshan main hai vahaan ke liye ek swytt nirnay banane ke liye or aavashyak jaankaree ke logon ke bich ek santulan he or duusare haath par sach dwaara bevajaah pareshaan nahin kiya ja rahaa
 Generally the rest is in favor of the truth, saying for autonomy is due to respect, but sometimes people will have implications not to ask, understand or lack capacity
 uparokt siddhanton kaa paalan karke, nurse ek tarika he ki unke dhyaan main vyakti kii garima ko banaae rakhata he main abhinay kar sakate hai
 Although this important area results in nursing practice, behavior is sometimes challenged by environmental, policy or resource constraints

 Ryan Joseph Wilson was born to Danny Wilson, a Rugby Union player from the Cardiff RFC, and Leanie Giggs at St Davids Hospital in Canton, Cardiff, Wales

 In 1980, when Giggs was six years old, his father changed the rugby code and signed for the Swinton RLFC, forcing his entire family to depart north of the Swinton area of salford, Greater Manchester
 The transfer was a shock as Giggs was very fond of his maternal grandparents in Cardiff and therefore often went there with his family on weekends or school holidays
 gigs mishrit nasl ke hai kyonki unke dada siyara leone ke rahane vaale hai or isiilie unhen apane bachapan main naslwad ke saamana karnaa padaa he
 After moving to Manchester, Giggs performed the game on behalf of a local team called Deans FC whose coach was Manchester City scout Dennis Scofield

 Wood told United's boss, "he is with Siti right now and if you lose her, you will regret it"

 1975 europea cap final leeds united or bern munich ke bich 28 may 1975 par, park des princes, paris main yojit ek footbal match tha
 Bayern Munich were victories that would appear for all in what would be the second of three consecutive European Cup finals and featured heavily in Team Germany's 1974 World Cup which many, such as Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Uli Hoennes The vests of great players were overwhelming favorites last season and wins such as this
 In the Bundeslig season 1974–75, Bayern was due to a severe meltdown after winning the last three German championships

 For Leeds United, only United English club FC Barcelona to reach the finals of all three European Cup competitions, Manchester United in 1968 and the second team in history to reach the final, the climax of the game's 'renown' year
 Team created by former manager Don Revie
 The veteran, but now aging team, finished only 9th in the 1974–75 Football League

 Despite the game Leeds in the second level of controversy surrounding English football, the final still appears in the mantra 'we are the champions, champions of Europe' - amid a sense that the club was betrayed with the victory of the club
 Often by fans during distant half-time intervals in the game
 Bayern would remain one of Europe's top clubs and go on to win the final in 1976, completing a hat-trick of victories - but would eventually have to wait until 2001 for their fourth title

 sandharitra yaa capaceter, vidyut paripath main prayukt hone vaala do siron vaala ek pramukh avyav he
 If two or more drivers are separated and kept close by an insulating medium, this arrangement is called a capacitor
 in chaalkon par baraabar tathaa vipareet aavesh hote hai
 If the capacitor is connected to a battery, current will not flow through it, but an equal amount of positive and negative charge will accumulate on its plates
 vidyut sandharitra kaa upyog vidyut aavesh, athwa sthir vaidyut urja, kaa sanchay karne ke liye tathaa vaidyut filter, snabar aadi main hota he
 The capacitor consists of two plates of metal with a malleable dielectric material filled in the space between them
 sandharitra ke platon ke bich dhara kaa pravaah tabhi hota he jab iske donon platon ke bich kaa vibhavaantar samay ke saath badale
 For this reason, no current flows in the capacitor in a permanent state when the fixed DC voltage is applied
 kintu sandharitra ke dono siron ke bich prayavarti vibhavaantar lagane par uske platon par sanchit aavesh kam yaa adhik hota rahata he jiske kaaran vahya paripath main dhara bahati he
 DC current cannot flow through the capacitor
 sandharitra kii dhara or uske platon ke bich main vibhavaantar kaa sambandh nimnaankit sameekaran se diya jaataa he- Where : sandharitra ko aaweshit karne main jo kaary karnaa padataa he vah sandharitra main sangrahit ho jaati he
 This energy stored in the capacitor is in the form of an electric field
 sangrahit urja u kaa maan nimnlikhit sutara dwaara abhivyakt hoti he- The value of the energy stored in the unit volume at any point in the electrical field can be given by the following formula- jis prakaar pratirodhon or prerakatvon ko aavashyaktaanusaar shreneekram yaa samaantar kram main jodakar uchit maan tathaa uchit reating praapt kar lee jaati he, usee prakaar do yaa adhik sandharitron ko bhi aavashyaktaanusaar sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 Equivalent capacitance of n capacitors connected in series is given by the following formula: do sandharitra shreneekram main jode jaany to unki tulya dharita nimnlikhit saral sutara se nikaala ja saktaa he- And if both capacitors are of equal value, then their equivalent capacitance becomes half the capacitance of each, if combined in series
 udhaaharan ke liye 10 micropharad ke do sandharitron ko shreneekram main jodne par tulya dharita 5 micropharad hogi
 The total capacitance of capacitors connected in parallel order is equal to the sum of their capacitances
 udhaaharan ke liye 10 micropharad vaale 4 sandharitra samaantarkram main jod diye jaany to unki kul dharita 40 micropharad ho jaaegi
 Two plates of capacitor can be combined in different ways
 is prakaar sandharitra bhi kai tarah ke hote hai
 The main information about the three main geometry capacitors is given in the table below
 sandharitra ke do chaalkon ke bich ke kuchaalak kii ek mukhya gun uski parmitivity he jo ε se nirupit kii jaati he
 The permittivity of the vacuum is denoted by ε0
 iskaa maan he: 1
 Accumulation of charge - One of the main uses of capacitor is to collect charge
 2
urja kaa sanchay karne main-aaweshit sandharitron ke bich vaidhut sthit urja rahati he
 3
 In electronic circuits - capacitors are used for various functions in electronic circuits

 These collections are in every genre of writing, such as poetry collection, essay collection etc
 lekin bahut se lekhakon kii kahaniyon ko ek hi kitaab main sangrah kiya jaae to usko kahani-sankalan yaa katha-sankalan kehete hai
 This makes it clear that when a book is collected or published by collecting stories of the same author, it is called a story-collection or a story-collection

 Talat Mehmood was an Indian singer and actor
 apni thartharaati awaz se mashhoor unako ghazal kii duniya kaa raja bhi kaha jaataa he
 He was born on 24 February 1924 in Lucknow
 ve apni mata tathaa gayak pita kii chhathi santan the
 His father was willing to dedicate his voice to Allah, calling him the larynx of Allah, and used to sing only Islamic religious songs called Naatha
 bachapan main talat ne apane pita kii nakal karne kii koshish kii jiskaa ghar main zyada samarthan nahin mila
 One of his aunts listened to him and encouraged him
 unhone hi apni jid par kishoravay talat ko sangeet kii shiksha ke liye morish kalege main daakhil bhi karvaa diya
 At the age of sixteen, Talat got a chance to sing Kamal Dasgupta's song Sab Din Ek Ek Nahin Nahin
 yah geet prasaarit hone ke baad lakhanu main bahut lokapriy hua
 Within about a year, the team of the famous music recording company HMV came to Lucknow from Calcutta and two of their songs were recorded first
 unke chalane ke baad talat ke chaar or gane record kiye gaye jisamen ghazal tasviir teri dil meraa bahala na sakegi bhi shaamil thi
 This ghazal was well liked and was later included in a film
 duusare vishwayuddh ke samay un dinon main parshv gayan kaa shuruaati daur tha
 Most of the actors sang their own songs
 kundan laal sahagal kii lokapriyata se prerit hokar talat bhi gayak–abhinayta banane ke liye san 1944 main kalakatta ja pahunche, jo us samay in gatividhiyon kaa pradhan kendra tha
 Around the same time when Kundan Lal Sehgal left Calcutta and went to Mumbai
 kalakatta main sangharsh ke bich talat kii shuruyaat bangla geet gane se hui
 The recording company introduced him as singer Tapan Kumar
 tapan kumaar ke gaae sau se upar geet recordon main aae
 New Theaters made Talat a hero-singer in 1945 Rajalakshmi

 Encouraged, he went to Mumbai and met Anil Vishwas
 anil da ne yah kahkar lautaa diya ki abhinayta banane ke liye ve bahut duble hai
 With the intention of offering fat on the body, Talat went back to Calcutta where he got only two films till 1949 and Tum Aur Woh and Nirman
 kalakatta main kaam dhilaa dekhakar ve pun: mumbai pahunch gaye
 This time, Anil Biswas gave him the opportunity to sing behind the scenes in the film Arju of Filmistan Studios
 dilip kumaar ke upar filmaaya gaya geet i dil mujhe aisi jagah le chal hit ho gaya or talat kii kanpakapaati aawaaj sangeetkaaron kii nigaah main jam gai
 Around this time composer Naushad was looking for a favorite singer for himself

 They had not noticed Rafi or Manna Dey till then, so they thought to lose Talat for themselves
 1950 main babul ke liye talat ko ek baar phir dilip kumaar ke liye unhen gane kaa mauka mila - is baar naushaad ke haathon
 As soon as i got the song of this film, Aankhen Dil Dil Deewana was a hit and the voices of Talat Mehmood and Shamshad Begum were liked
 usee varsh talat ne vibhinn sangeetkaaron kii dhunon par kul solah gane gaae
 His popularity was increasing
 isi samay mukesh ko raaj kapur ke gaanon se khyaati mil rahi thi to rafee shahid, dulaari, mela tathaa baiju baavaraa ke gaanon se lokapriy ho rahe the
 Naushad began to ignore Talat due to his habit of smoking on the set, but the other musicians continued to sing something to Talat and the voice of Talat continued to resonate in the early fifties
 gane kii yah rafmaar talat lambey samay tak isliye kaayam nahin rakh paae kyonki ̧ gayak ke rup main khkhaati se unhen tasalli nahin thi or ve swayan ko ek safal or sthapit abhinayta ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate the ̧ baavjood is hakeekat ke ki ve jitne achche gayak the ̧ utane achche abhinayta nahin
 But in the longing of his voice, he was also given the opportunity to act
 aaraam main ve ek ghazal 'shukriya ay pyaar tera' gaate parade par nazar aae
 Then Sohrab Modi made him a hero in Minerva's heir with a top heroine like Suraiya and AR Kardar with new star Chand Usmani in Dile Naadan

 Talat came to know of the golden bird made in 1958 when he did not get anything special from acting and lost a lot in singing in return
 urdu kii prasiddh lekhika ismat chugtai kii kahani par abhinetri naragis ke jivan kii chhap thi
 Ismat Chughtai's husband Shaheed Latif was the producer-director, heroine Nutan and two heroes in front of him, one Balraj Sahni and the other Talat Mehmood
 sangeetkaar o pi naiyar ne zid pakad lee thi ki talat par filmaae janevaale gane 'pyaar par bas to nahin' ko rafee se gavaayenge
 In the end, he could sing the song Talat himself only when he threatened to leave the film work in between
 usee samay bimal raay kii madhumati ban rahi thi ̧ jisamen sangeetkaar salil choudhary dilip kumaar ke liye talat kii awaz lenaa chaahate the
 But at that time Mukesh was in the era of Girdish
 talat ne salil choudhary se kaha ki ve unki bajaay mukesh ko kaam den or madhumati main mukesh ne dilip kumaar ke liye aakiri baar gaaya
 Film musician admits that he had a wonderful talent of music creation
 'game aashiqui se kah do' kii dhun unhone palak jhapakate taiyaar kar di thi
 Instead of getting into the spin of acting, he would have gone much further if he moved towards becoming a musician
 saath kaa dashak shuru hote tak filmon main unke gane bahut kam hone lage
 'sujata' is jealous for which is his memorable song of the moment
 filmon ke liye aakiri baar unhone san 1966 main jahanara main gaaya ̧ jiske sangeetkaar madan mohan the
 After this, the form of film music started changing in such a way that there was no scope left for a voice like Talat
 lekin talat ke gair–filmi gayan kaa silsilaa baraabar chalata rahaa or unke album nikalate rahe
 They had become synonymous with Ghazal singing
 unki awaz jaise kudarat ne ghazal ke liye hi rachi thi
 Talat Mehmood was called to South Africa in 1956 for a stage performance
 is prakaar ke kaarykram ke liye bharat se kisi filmi kalakaar ke jane kaa yah pehla avasar tha
 Talat Mehmood's program was so successful that he had twenty-two programs in many cities of South Africa, and then there was a series of stage performances of Indian film artists abroad
 talat mahmud in kaaryakramon main lagaataar vyast rahe
 After getting a break from the film world, 'talat Mehmood Knight' started taking place in the country and abroad
 unki aamadani ke kaaran talat mahmud ko aarthik pareshaaniyon kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa tathaapi filmon main gane se dur ho jane kaa malaal unhen baraabar salata rahaa ̧ us samay tak ki jab tak pakshaaghaat ke kaaran ve gane main asamarth nahin ho gaye
 However, the number of listeners of his film and non-film songs did not decrease
 do sau filmon main unke lagbhag paanch sau or koi dhaai sau gair–filmi gane hai
 In 1962 he sang two songs for the Pakistani film Chirag Jalata Raha, composer Nihal Mohammed
 9 may 1998 ko talat mahmud apni nashwar kaaya chhodkar chale gaye

 Tandon's entry into politics was due to his love for Hindi
 17 farvari 1951 ko mujffarnagar 'suhrid sangh` ke 17 wein varshikotsav ke avasar par unhone apane bhaashan main is baat ko sweekaar bhi kiya tha

 His field of work is mainly divided into three parts - freedom struggle, literature and society
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main tandon ji ne ek yoddha kii bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya
 He was a member of the Congress party since 1899 in his student life
 1906 main ve elahabaad se bhartiya rashtriya congress ke pratinidhi chune gayi
 He was also associated with the Congress Party committee studying the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919

 On Gandhiji's call, he quit his flourishing profession of advocacy and jumped into this struggle

 In these elections, Congress got a majority in seven of the eleven provinces

 Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri writes - In 1936-37 elections were held for the new provincial stream meetings, in which the Congress participated with full power
 uttar pradesh main bhi congress ko baari safalataa mili or iskaa puraa shrey tandon ji ko jaataa he
 He toured all over the state, he himself stood for the Legislative Assembly from Prayag Nagar and won unopposed
 yah unke anuroop hi tha
 After some time when the cabinet was formed, he was elected unanimously president of Dhara Sabha

 In this order, he was placed under house arrest in 1940 and remained in jail for a year

 This was his last and seventh jail visit
 unke sangharsh or tyaag ko lakshith karte hue kishoridas vaajapeyi ji ne likhaa he- "jab jab rashtriya sangharsh hue, tandon ji sabase aage rahe
 You don't know how to sit empty
 " 1942 main jab ve jail se chute to unhen dikhalaai padaa ki bhartiya samaaj main niraashaa chhaayi hui he, sabhi hataash pade hue hai
 Therefore, he re-established the new consciousness by establishing an organization called 'congress Representative Assembly' and when the provincial committees were formed, the 'representative Assembly' was dissolved

 He continued to consider Hindi as the means to achieve independence before the independence of the country and to maintain independence after independence
 " yahan yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki tandon ji kaa raajnneeti main pravesh hindi prem ke kaaran hi hua
 Tandon ji worked as a lecturer in Hindi at Victoria College, Gwalior, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a student of Victoria College at that time
 17 farvari 1951 ko mujffarnagar 'suhrid sangh' ke 17 wein varshikotsav ke avasar par tandon ji ne kaha tha- "hindi ke paksh ko sabal karne ke uddeshy se hi maine congress jaisi sanstha main pravesh kiya, kyonki mere hriday par hindi kaa hi prabhaav sabase adhik tha or maine use hi apane jivan kaa sabase mahaan vrath banaaya

 My love for Hindi literature forced me to join politics to protect her interests and to clarify the path of her development
 " at: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki tandon ji ke saadhy swatantraaa or hindi donon hi the
 Rajarshi had an affection for Hindi since childhood
 is prem ko baalkrishna bhatta or madan mohan malviya ji ne praudhata pradaan karne kii
 On October 10, 1910, the first session of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan was held in Kashi under the chairmanship of Mahamana Malaviya ji and Tandon Ji was appointed the minister of the conference
 tadnantar hindi sahitya sammelan ke madhyam se hindi kii atyadhik seva kii
 Tandon ji established Hindi Vidyapeeth Prayag to spread Hindi
 is peeth kii sthapana kaa uddeshy hindi shiksha kaa prasar or angreji ke varchasv ko samaapt karnaa tha
 The conference held several Hindi examinations
 in parikshaon se dakshin main bhi hindi kaa prachaar prasar hua
 This work of the conference also had an impact in colleges and universities, Hindi courses were recognized in many colleges and universities
 ve jaanate the ki sampoorn bharat main hindi ke prasar ke liye ahindi bhashiyon kaa sahyog apekshit he
 Perhaps the result of his thinking was Gandhi's participation in the conference
 aage chalakar 'hindustani' ke prashn par tandon ji or mahatma gandhi main matbhed hua
 Tandon ji was an unbeatable warrior
 ve satya or nyaay ke liye kisi se bhi loha le sakate the
 On his principles, he remained immobile and stable like a rock
 parinamat: gandhi ji ko apane ko sammelan se alag karnaa padaa, tandon ji niraapad apane maarg par badhate rahe
 In 1949, when the question of official language was raised in the Constituent Assembly, there was a strange situation at that time
 mahatma gandhi to hindustani ke samarthak the hi, pan0 nehru or dow rajendra prasad tathaa anya anek netaa bhi hindustani ke pakshdhar the, par tandon ji haare nahin, jhuke nahin
 As a result, he also won
 11, 12, 13, 14 disambar 1949 ko garmagaram bahes ke baad hindi or hindustani ko lekar congress main matdaan hua, hindi ko 62 or hindustani ko 32 mat mili
 Eventually, Hindi was declared as the national language and Devanagari royalty
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha or 'vandemaataram' ko raashtragit sweekrut karaane ke liye tandon ji ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ek or abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 He had also collected signatures and letters of support from crores of people
 yahan yah ullekh kar dena bhi apekshit he ki tandon ji ne nagari ankon ko samvidhan main manyata dilaane ke liye bharsak koshish kii is hetu unhone us sanstha ko choda jisaki seva lagbhag paanch dashak tak kii
 In the Constituent Assembly, Rajarshi opposed the English numerals, but due to the instruction of Nehru ji, Congress Member Shri Kanhaiyalal Maniklal Munshi was in favor of the formula of Shri Gopal Swami Iyengar
 tandon ji kaa virodh prastaav gir gaya or nagari ank samvidhan main manyata praapt na kar sake
 In order to get Hindi the national language and 'vande Mataram' the national anthem, Tandon ji launched another campaign with his colleagues
 unhone karodon logon ke hastakshar or samarthan patr bhi ekatra kiye the
 While assessing the personality and work of Rajarshi, often his litterateur form is ignored
 vah ek ucchkoti ke rachanaakaar the
 The earliest history can be discovered in his works
 sahityakar ke rup main tandon ji nibandhkaar, kavi or patrkaar ke rup main dikhalaai padate hai
 His essays are related to Hindi language and literature, religion and culture and other diverse fields
 kavy rachanaaon main 'bandar sabha mahakavy', 'kutir kaa pushp' or 'swatantraaa' apana aitihaasik mahatv rakhti hai
 These poems feature nationalism and patriotism
 unki rachanaaon main kavyashastra kii baariki foondnaa chhidranveshan karnaa hi hoga, kintu yugin yatharth kii abhivyakti tandon ji ne jis dhang se kii he, vah nishchay hi shlaghneey he- The 'bandar Sabha epic' has exposed the policies of the British in the Alha style
 unhone angrejon ke prati jo chutkiyaan lee hai unamem se ek-do kaa anand aap bhi lijie- In the field of journalism, Tandon ji was also a great scholar of English
 shri tribhuvan narayan singh ji ne ullekh kiya he ki san 1950 main jab ve congress ke sabhapati chune gaye to unhone apana abhibhaashan hindi main likhaa or angreji anuwaad maine kiya
 Shri Sampurnanand ji also saw that English translation, but when Tandon ji read that translation, he rewrote many pages in it
 tab mujhe is baat kii anubhuti hui ki jahaan ve hindi ke prakand vidwaan the, vahiin angreji sahitya par bhi unka bada adhikaar tha
 Seeing the multi-dimensional and talented personality of Purushottam Das Tandon, he was conferred with the title of 'rajarshi'
 15 april san 1948 kii sandhyavela main sarayu tat par vaidic mantrocchar ke saath mahant devraha baba ne aapako 'rajarshi` kii oopaadhi se alankrita kiya
 Some people found it unfair, but Sri Shankaracharya Maharaj of Jyotirmath considered it scriptural and confirmed it by the Pandit Sabha of Kashi at the degree distribution ceremony of the All India Cultural Conference of 1948
 tab se yah oopaadhi unke naam ke saath avichhinn rup se judi hui swayan alankrita ho rahi he
 The Rajarshi was a staunch opponent of stereotypes and superstitions even though Indian culture was extremely supportive and supportive
 unhone bhartiya samaaj main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kuprathaon par bhi apane do took vichaar vyakt kiye
 He had a wonderful self-power, so that he could complete the toughest tasks easily
 balvivaah or vidhwaa vivaah ke sambandh main unka maananaa tha ki "vidhwaa vivaah kaa prachaar hamaari sabhyataa, hamaare sahitya or hamaare samaaj sanghathan ke mukhya aadhaar pativrat dharm ke pratikul hai" unhone spasht kiya ki vidhwaa-vivaah kii maang isliye jor pakad rahi he, kyonki hamaare samaaj main bal-vivaah kii shaastra viruddh pranali chal padi he or bal vidhwaaon kaa prashn hi bhartiya samaaj kii mukhya samasya he
 Hence, "stopping the practice of child marriage proves to be more important than widow's marriage
" " One or two examples of this aspect of his personality will suffice - often people think that cooked food is digestible, but Rajarshi considered it a stereotype and did not accept food cooked with fire for years
 chini khaanaa ek baar chhod diya
 On one hand they avoided cow's milk and on the other hand with leather shoes
 is prakaar ve ek adbhut vyaktitv ke dharak the
 In India, the problem of communalism existed in its form before independence
 kuch netaa tandon ji par bhi sampradayik hone kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai
 It is true that Rajarshi was the ultimate devotee and nurturer of his culture
 ve yah kehane main bhi hichak kaa anubhav nahin karte the ki bharat main do samskritiyon ko jivit rakhana desh ke saath vishwasghaat karnaa hoga, par iskaa matlab yah nahin tha ki tandon ji sampradayik the, muslim virdohi the
 In this regard, how meaningful are the views of Kulakusum- swayan tandon ji ne bhi likhaa he- In fact, Tandon's personality was humanistic
 unke ghar par jo balak unka sahyog karata tha, vah musalmaan tha, par kisi vidmbana he ki log kehete hai ki tandon ji sampradayik the
 There are many other aspects of Rajarshi Tandon's personality; Just like he was the poor, the victim's help, Deenbandhu in the true sense, the idol of compassion and Babuji was a person of moral conduct, it can be inferred from this example- "san 1950 kaa mahakumbh tha
 The daughter-in-law said to go by car to take a bath in the Ganges
 babu ji ne uttar diya ki gaadi 'spikar` kii he
 You can go with me, but not alone
 " After the above brief discussion it can be said that Rajarshi's personality was multi-faceted and consistent with Rajarshi
 ve bahumukhi pratibha ke dhani the
 He was not only an exclusive lover of Hindi, but was also synonymous with Hindi
 hindi sahitya ke itihaas main unka ullekh ek samarth kavi or niabandh lekhak ke rup main hota he
 He is counted among the frontline fighters among the immortals of the Indian freedom struggle and his name is inscribed with golden letters in the history of the Indian freedom struggle
 ve param snehi, udaar or karunaa kii murti hote hue bhi ispati vyaktitv ke dharak the
 Immovable and unalterable like the Himalayas

 In 1961, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest state honor of India

 My love for Hindi literature forced me to join politics to protect her interests and to clarify the path of her development
 " Percy Bayesi Shelley was a great poet of English Romanticism
 unhen aalochakon dwaara angreji kavita ke sarvesheshth geet kavi ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The political and social scenes of the time can be seen in his poetry
 shelli ne apane jeevankaal main adhik prashiddhi praapt nahin kii lekin mrityu ke baad unki prashiddhi kaaphi bad gayi
 He was born on August 4, 1792, at Field Place near Harsham Nagar, Sussex
 teraa varsh kii umr main ve iton naamak prasiddh saarvajanik vidhyalay main pravisht hue
 He was a very skilled student and had a keen interest in reading and writing
 sheeghra hi unhone greek tathaa latin bhashaaon par adhikaar praapt kar liya
 Before leaving school, he wrote two novels of bizarre style - 'jestrozzi' and 'st
 Evine' which appeared in 1810 AD and 1811 AD
 unhone anek kavitaaon kii bhi rachana kii jo 1810 i
 main 'original poetry bai victor and ke

 He had become a staunch opponent of all kinds of cruel wrongdoing and orthodoxy in his studentship and that is why almost everyone in the school called him crazy and atheist
 san 1810 i

 But a year later, he wrote a two-page booklet titled 'the Necessity of Ethics', in which he, according to his ideology, proved the need for atheism and copies of which he sent to the university authorities

 At that time there was a great movement against the English state in Ireland and Shelley went there to help and encourage this seditious movement and gave speeches in many public meetings
 1813 i

 Around this time, he had differences with his wife and in 1814, they separated from each other forever
 is durghatana kaa prabhaav unki patni par itnaa bura padaa ki usne aatmahatya kar lee
 In the meantime, Shelley was introduced to another woman named Mary Godwin, and in 1816, they were married in London
 isi varsh unka prasiddh kavyagranth 'alester' prakashit hua
 Thereafter he went on a tour of Switzerland and France
 jab ve england laute to unke pita ne unako kshamaa kar diya jisase unka sab aarthik ksht, jo unhen bahut khal rahaa tha, dur ho gaya
 After some time living in cities called Marlow and Windsor, Shelley and his wife moved to Italy and toured all the famous cities there
 kintu ve sab atyant ramnik hote hue bhi shelli ke swasthyanukool siddh na hue or antat: san 1819 i
 main ve pisa nagar main rahane lage
 Meanwhile, Shelley composed 'chenchi', 'prometheus Unbound', 'rosalind and Helen', and 'odd to the Westwind', and in Pisa he composed 'adonis', 'apiacykidian', and many of the best lyrical poems 
 jahaan bhi ve rahe sarvatha swatantra vichaaron ke anuyaayi rahe
 He studied Greek literature
 spain, italy tathaa germany kii bhashaaon par adhikaar praapt kiya
 But even after doing all this, his mind could not find peace anywhere
 at: pisa se ravenna se lerisi or lerisi se leghorn bhatakate rahe
 When he was going to Spagia in 1822, his boat sank in the sea and he died prematurely
 bahut dinon ke baad jab unki laash mili tab samudratat par unki dahkriya hui or unke bhasmaphul rome ke us prasiddh protestant shavsthaan main dafan kiye gaye jiske bare main shelli ne swayan likhaa tha ki yah sthaan itnaa romantic he ki dekhanewaalon ko yadi mrityu hi se anuraag ho jaae to koi asambhav baat nahin he
 Shelley ranks highest among the lyrical poets of England
 unki kavita main geetikavy ke sabhi gun vidyaman hai- maadhurya hai, maadakta he, veg he, shabdayojna kaa saundarya he, bhaavon kii gaharaai he, kavi kii hardik anubhutiyon kii maarmik vyanjana he, vednaa kii tis he, or aashaa tathaa aakanksha kii aag he

 aadhunik prachlan main, sofist vah vyakti he, jo dusron ko apane mat main karne ke liye yuktiyon, evam vyakhyaaon kaa avishkaar kar sake
 But this is not the original meaning of "sophist"
 pracheen unani darshankaal main, gyanashrayi darshanik hi sofist the
 "philosoph" was not popular then
 isa purv paanchavin tathaa chauthi shatabdiyon main yunaan ke kuch simavarti darshanikon ne saanskrithik vichaaron ke viruddh andolan kiya
 The city of Athens was the center of ancient Greek culture
 vahaan is andolan kii hansee udayi gai
 Some of Aflatoon's dialogues are named after philosophers called sophists
 unamem sucraat or pramukh sofiston ke bich vivaad prastut karte hue ant main sofiston ko nirutar kara diya gaya he
 Socrates' renunciation had caused him so much respect in Greece that, considering Socrates an opponent of the Sophist movement, tradition considered the term "sophist" to be defamatory
 vastut: sophist darshanikon ne hi unani sabhyataa kaa maanvikaran kiya
 Before that, no Greek philosopher had ever considered man the creator of civilization and culture
 ekian sabhyataa main, jisaki jhalak haamar ke elliod naamak mahakavy main milti hai, sristi kaa bhaar olympus ke devi devataaon ko saunpa gaya tha
 In the sixth century BC, the philosophy that originated due to reluctance from the Gods and Goddesses, that nature, or destiny, was considered the mother of the world and its entire motion method
 kintu sofist vichaarkon kaa dhyaan is vichaar ke pratyaksh rup kii ore gaya
 He observed that Devaputra, or Prakritiputra, was beset by Greek noble practice
 unhone samaaj ko swatantra purushon evam daason main vibhajit kar rakhaa tha
 There was no framework for public education
 upekshit varg kaa jankaryon main koi sthaan na tha
 Any plan of change could be expected to succeed only if man was given credit for preserving the old corrupt traditions
 atev sofiston ne prakrutivaadee darshan ke sthaan par maanavvaadi darshan kii sthapana kii
 In the dialogue called "protagoras" of Aflatun, it is called from the mouth of the famous sophist Protagoras - Man is the measure of all things, that they are that which they are, that they are not that they are not
 yahi sofist vichaarkon ke darshan kaa mukhya swar tha
 That is why the teachers of ancient traditions ridiculed him as "sophist"
 kintu unani sabhyataa ke janajagran ke ve agradoot the
 Sophist thinkers started educating everyone by eliminating the discrimination between civil and slave
 sofiston ne kahin apane vidhyalay sthapit nahin kiye
 They roamed around and taught
 ni:shulk shikshan ke ve samarthak na the, kyonki unhone isi kaary ko apana vyavsaay bana liya tha
 Never before in Greece, in the form of art, was the teaching of speech
 sofiston ne, jankaarya ke liye bhaashan kii yogyata anivaary samajhakar, yuvakon ko sambhashankala sikhaanaa prarambh kiya
 Sophists named Asemax and Theodorus prepared comments on the subject for their students
 arestu ne inke rin ko sweekaar nahin kiya kintu apane "retariks" main usne inaki do hui saamagree kaa upyog kiya tha
 Prodicus wrote books to explain the meaning of similar words
 shiksha kii drushti se yah kaary us pracheen kaal main kitna mahatvapurn tha jab unani bhashaa ke shabdkosh kaa nirmaan nahin hua tha
 Not only this, sophists also prepared lessons on science etc
 prasiddh he ki sofist kisi bhi shabd kaa manamaana arth kar lete the
 But there is another side to his work
 tab tak kisi simit vyakhyapaddati kaa vikaas nahin hua tha
 This work of sophists opened the eyes of the thinkers and they understood that only by restricting the rules of thinking, interpretations can be limited
 arestu ke "tadatmya ke niyam" ko sofiston kii swatantra vyakhyapaddati kaa fal maananaa sambhavat: anuchit na hoga
 Tradition holds sophists to be nurturers of gross individualism
 kintu protagoras ke kathan ko ki "manushya hi sab vastuon kii maap he" yadi us samay tak viksit darshanik maton kaa ek sankshipt tippanee maane to koi badi bhul na hogi
 Philosophers had no criterion for thinking, nor did they have any style of thinking
 paashchaatya tark kaa janmdata arestu to baad main hua
 Therefore, the independent interpretation of sophist thinkers can be said to be the reason for the logical rise of Greek philosophy

 narayan ne bhi bahut thode samay ke liye ek adhyaaapak tathaa patrkaar ke rup main kaary karne ke sivaa apana sara jivan lekhan main hi lagaaya
 RK Narayan lived in Yadavagiri in Mysore for nearly two decades
 1990 main beemaari kii vajah se ve chennai shift kar gayi the
 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1960 for a novel guide composed by him
 unhone ek kaalpanik shahar malgudi ko aadhaar banaakar apni anek rachanaayen kii hai
 Malgudi is often considered a fictional town in South India; But according to the statement of the author himself, "if i say that Malgudi is a town in South India, then it will also be incomplete truth, because the symptoms of Malgudi will be found everywhere in the world
 " His first novel Swami and his friends were published in 1935
 is upanyaas main ek schuli ladke swaminathan kaa behad manoranjak varnan he tathaa upanyaas ke sheershak kaa swami usee ke naam kaa sankshipteekaran he
 The satire is embedded in the title of this novel
 sheershak se kahani ke bare main pathak jaisi ummid karne lagata he, use lekhak puri tarah dhwast kar detaa he
 This Swami is a boy who breaks the glass of the windows of the Head Master's office by being absent in class at school and keeps staring like idiots on the next day when he is not being questioned and on the sheer backside and On standing at the desk, he suddenly jumps up and runs away, picking up books saying 'I don't care about your dirty school'
 isi tarah swami kii kahani main ek ladke kii saamaanya sharaarton or uske evaj main milane vaali sajaaon kaa hi varnan he
 But the writer tells him to understand a boy's mind completely in a very funny tone
 aarambhik upanyaas hone se isamen narayan badhati umr ke saath anubhav kii jane vaali takalif tathaa samay ke bitne kii anubhuti kaa ahsaas aadi ke rup main rachanaatmak praudhata kaa puraa parichay to nahin de pate, parantu bachapan kii puri taazgi ko katha main utaar dene main bilkul safal hote hai
 'graduation' was published in 1935
 yah ek samvedansheel yuvak chandan kii kahani he jo uske shiksha dwaara praapt prem evam vivaah sambandhi pashchimi vichaaron tathaa jis saamaajik dhaanche main vah rahata he ke bich ke dwandv ko prastut karata he
 The Dark Room is also a story woven from the details of small things and events of everyday life
 isamen savitri naamak ek aisi paramparaagat nari kii katha he jo samast kashton ko maun rahakar sahan karti he
 Her husband is attracted to another working woman and despite being hurt by this, Savitri eventually stays in harmony
 haalaanki aisa nahin he ki kahani sapaat rup main kah di gayi he
 The author has shown skill in drawing emotions
 pati ke duusari aurat ko na chhodane se utpann niraashaa main savitri ladati bhi he or ghar chhodkar chali bhi jaati he
 In this state of despair, he realizes that life is actually life only when he is capable of self-reliance
 anyathaa "veshya or shaadishuda auraton main fark hi kya he? -- sirf yah ki veshya aadmi badalati rahati he or bivi ek se hi chipki rahati he
 Both depend on the man for his bread and support
 " niraashaa ke isi alam main vah aatmahatya kii bhi koshish karti he
 After being saved, she decides to live with her earnings by not returning home and also gets a job in a temple
 parantu, antat is sab kii vyarthta, hataasha or swayan apni durbalata mahasoos karke haar maan leti he or phir ghar lautne kaa nishchay kar leti he
 Giving details of small things, the writer marks the fullness of emotions
 swatantraaa se pehle lekhak kaa antim upanyaas da english teacher 1946 main prakashit hua
 The novel was published in America under the title 'grateful to Life and Death'
 isamen lekhak ne ek aisi kahani chuni he jis ke baad kaa ansh avishwasaneey ho gaya he
 In the beginning of the story, there is a good example of the house and home of Lakshmi i
e
 loving behavior towards the wife, but in the later part of the story, after the death of that wife, there has been talk of contact with her soul, which is the creative level But it looks incredible
 vastutah narayan kii rachanaatmakataa ke teen str hai
 The 'golden age' of his creative superiority came after Indian independence
 1952 isvi se 1962 isvi tak ke ek dashak se kuch adhik varshon kaa samay unki rachanaatmakataa kaa swarna yug tha
 The time before and after it can be divided clearly
 rachanaatmak praudhata ke is shreshth samay main lekhak ke upanyaason kii trayee aayi
 These three novels were - The Financial Expert, Guide and the man-eater of Malgudi
 san 1960 main sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit 'guide' narayan kii rachanaatmakataa kaa shikhar he
 It has been considered his best novel
 unki vyangy drushti anyatra kahin bhi itani tikshn tathaa naitik sarokaaron se judi hui nahin he or na hi takanic itani sookshm he
 In 'malgudi's Aadamkhor', the author expresses his moral concern by creatively reviving the context of the ancient mythological story of Bhasmasura with modernity
 yah aadhunik bhasmasur pashuon kii khaal main bhusa bharne vaala ek swaarthee, uddhat tathaa adharmee uddand vaasu naamak paatr he, jo mandir ke hathi ko shoot karne ke liye ghaat lagaakar baitha rahata he, parantu anayas hi apane maathe ke paas mandaraati ek makkhi ko maarane ke praytn main goli chal jane se khud ko hi maar daalata he
 The author has also given a long description of the mixed humor of humor
 udhaahranswaroop jyotishi dwaara aadhi acchhee tithi bataane par yah puche jane par ki baadha kya ho sakati he, jyotishi kahata he ki ho saktaa he ki anguuthe main chot lag jaae, yaa coffee ke liye rakhaa doodh khatta pad jaae, yaa nalke main chalata hua pani ekaek band ho jaae
 Apparently the writer here makes a mockery of the prevailing hypocrisy as a complete hypocrisy, ignoring the best side of astrology
 uparivarnit aupnyasik brihattrayee ke bich prakashit 'mahatma kaa intjaar' main spasht rup se tathaa baad main prakashit 'da vendor of sweets' kii prishthbhumi main gandhivadi sangharsh he
 'waiting for the Mahatma' is a study of how the Gandhian revolution reacted to the Indian public
 raajnneetik prachaar se dur ek mukammal sarjanaatmak kalakriti ke rup main yah adhyayan sampann hua he
 In 1976, 9 years after 'the Vendor of Sweets', The Painter of Sinus was published
 in upanyaason ko padhate hue lekhkeey kshamta ke pradarshan ke baavjood lagata he ki lekhak kaa 'guide' evam 'malgudi kaa aadamkhor' vaala swarna yug ab utaar par aa gaya he
 However, the creation journey of Narayan continued and the works filled with subject-matter continued
 vastutah apni bahuaiami kritiyon ke madhyam se dakshin bharat ke shisht samaaj kii vichitrataaon kaa varnan unhone safalataa ke saath kiya he
 The author's special goal is an Indian full of Englishness
 apane upanyaason ke saath-saath kahaniyon main bhi uskaa varnan uske khandit vyaktitv, aatmavanchanaa or usamen antarnihit morrkhtaa aadi ke saath unhone kiya he
 Narayan's predominant voice as a storyteller is of gentle satire
 vyangy-viparyay dwaara lekhak maanviya manovigyaan par prakaash daalate rahete hai
 Some of the stories are also sketches and they are full of the ability to capture the understanding of Narayan's eccentric characters
 aar ke narayan kii praayah sabhi kahaniyaan ek jaisi chust-durust tathaa aisi style main kahi gayi he jo upar se sapaat si lagati he
 They do not adopt any revolutionary style in the story
 sahaj pathneeyata unki kahani kaa atirikt vaishishty he
 Despite this, the author's 'guide' and 'man-eater of the Malgudi' novelist form overshadows his storyteller form, as the best stories do not evolve from a simple posture of satire to a meaningful life vision
