 prabal anyonya kriya prakruti kii chaar moolbhoot anyonya kriyaaon main se ek he, anya teen anyonya kriyaayein gurutvkarshan, vidyut chumbakeey anyonya kriya or durbal anyonya kriya hai
 At the nuclear level, this interaction is 100 times stronger than the existing magnetic interaction, so it is much stronger than weak and gravitational interactions
 is anyonya kriya ko protonon va neutronon ke bandhan bal ke rup main bhi pahachaanaa jaataa he
 Before the seventies physicists were unsure about the fastening process of molecular nuclei
 yah us samay bhi gyaat tha ki nabhik protonon va neutronon se milakar bana he jahaan proton dhanaveshit kan hai or neutron anaveshit kan hai
 Therefore, these effects were seen as opposing each other
 tatkaaleen bhautik gyaan ke anusaar, dhanaveshit kan ek dusre ko pratikarshith karte hai or atah nabhik kaa vighatan bahut hi jaldi hona chahie athwa nabhik asthitv main nahin hona chahie
 Although this was never observed
 atah is prakriya ko samajhane ke liye naye bhautikee kii zarurat thi
 Despite the mutual electromagnetic repulsion of the protons, a new strong attraction force was assumed to understand the molecular nucleus
 is kalpit bal ko prabal bal naam diya gaya, jise ek moolbhoot bal mana gaya jo nabhik par aropit hota he jahaan nabhik protonon va neutronon se bana hota he
 Here the carrier of this force was assumed to be π ± and π0
 saath hi in kanon ke dravyaman ke aadhaar par is bal kii paraas fermi koti kii maani jane lagi
 It was invented later that protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles but consist of their constituent particles quarks
 nabhikeey kanon ke madhya lagane vaala prabal aakarshan bal proton va neutron ke andar sthit quarkon ko baandhe rakhane vaale moolbhoot kan kaa parshv prabhaav maatr he
 According to the theory of quantum chroma dynamics, quarks have colored charges, although this color is not related to normal colors
 alag varna aavesh vaale quark prabal anyonya kriya ke prabhaav main ek duusare ko aakarshith karte hai jiske vaahak gluon naamak kan hai
 The main reason for saying this interaction is strong is its predominance among all interactions
 yah bal vidyut chumbakeey balon se 102 guna, durbal bal se 106 guna or gurutveey bal se 1039 guna prabal hota he
 This force is studied mainly in quantum chroma dynamics, which is an important part of the standard model
 ganitiya rup se kwantum chromo gatiki samamiti samooh SU par aadhaarit akramavinimay amman siddhanth he
 Quarks and gluons are the only basic particles that have no extinction charge and hence participate in strong interactions
 prabal bal pratyaksh rup se keval quark va gluon se hi kriya karata he

 Sati was the daughter of Daksha Prajapati and the consort of Lord Shiva
 inaki utpatti tathaa ant kii katha vibhinn puraanon main vibhinn roopon main uplabdh hoti he
 Due to the predominance of Lord Shiva in the Shaiva Puranas, Shiva is said to be the ultimate element and power as his follower
 isi ke samanaantar shakt puraanon main shakti kii pradhanta hone ke kaaran shakti ko paramashkti tathaa bhagwaan shiv ko unka anugami bataaya gaya he
 The Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana has a relatively neutral description
 isamen daksh kii swymbhuv manu kii putree prasuti ke garbh se 16 kanyaon ke janm kii baat kahi gayi he
 14 girls have been mentioned in Devipuran and sixty girls of Daksha have been mentioned in Shivpuran out of which 27 were married to Moon
 in kanyaon main ek sati bhi thi
 According to Shiv Puran, Brahma ji was worried about Lord Shiva's marriage, then he praised Lord Vishnu and Vishnu ji was pleased and told Brahma ji that if Lord Shiva is to get married then worship Goddess Shiva
 unhone bataaya ki daksh se kahie ki vah bhagwati shiva kii tapasya karen or unhen prasann karke apni putree hone kaa vardaan maange
 If Goddess Shiva is pleased then all the work will be successful
 unke kathananusaar brahma ji ne daksh se bhagwati shiva kii tapasya karne ko kaha or prajapati daksh ne devi shiva kii ghor tapasya kii
 Pleased with his penance, Shiva gave him a boon that i will be born as your daughter
 main to sabhi janmon main bhagwaan shiv kii daasi hoon; atah main swayan bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya karke unhen prasann karuungi or unki patni banungi
 At the same time, he also told Daksha that when your respect will be reduced to me, then at the same time i will abandon my body, get absorbed in my form or wear another body
 prayek sarg yaa kalp ke liye daksh ko unhone yah vardaan de diya
 Accordingly, Bhagwati Shiva takes birth as the daughter of Daksha in the name of Sati and pleases Lord Shiva by performing intense penance and is married to Lord Shiva
 iske baad kii katha shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main varnit katha ke kaaphi had tak anuroop hi he
 In Prayag, on the arrival of Daksha in a yajna of the Prajapati, all the gods stand and honor him, but Lord Shiva is also sitting with Brahma
 loukik buddhi se bhagwaan shiv ko apana jamata arthath putr samaan maanane ke kaaran daksh unke khadey na hokar apane prati aadar prakat na karne ke kaaran apana apmaan mahasoos karata he or isi kaaran unhone bhagwaan shiv ke prati anek katuctiyon kaa prayog karte hue unhen yajna bhaag se vanchit hone kaa shaap de diya
 After this, Manomalinya was born in Daksha and Lord Shiva
 tatpashchaat apni rajdhani kankhal main daksh ke dwaara ek viraat yajna kaa aayojan kiya gaya jisamen unhone na to bhagwaan shiv ko aamantrit kiya or na hi apni putree sati ko
 Sati saw Rohini going with the moon by plane and after Sakhi came to know that they were going to take part in her father Daksha's Virat Yajna, Sati's mind was also disturbed to go there
 bhagwaan shiv ke samajhane ke baavjood sati kii vyakulata bani rahi or bhagwaan shiv ne apane ganon ke saath unhen vahaan jane kii ajna de di
 But not seeing the sacrifice of Lord Shiva going there, Sati objected and Sati consumed her body with Yogagni because of the utmost disrespectful things being said by Daksha to her and her husband Lord Shiva
 shivganon ke dwaara utpaat machaaye jane par bhrigu rishi ne dakshinagni main aahuti di or usase utpann rubhu naamak devataaon ne shivganon ko bhaga diya
 Very upset with this news, Lord Shiva produced Veerabhadra with his hair and Veerabhadra went with Gana and destroyed Daksha Yagya; Punished Shiva's adversary gods and sages as appropriate and cut Daksha's head and burnt it in the Havan Kund
 tatpashchaat devataaon sahit brahma ji ke dwaara stuti kiye jane se prasann bhagwaan shiv ne punah yajna main hui kshatiyon kii purti kii tathaa daksh kaa sir jal jane ke kaaran bakre kaa sir judwa kar unhen bhi jivit kar diya
 Then the yagna was completed by his grace
 shakt mat main shakti kii sarvapradhanta hone ke kaaran brahma, vishnu evam shiv teenon ko shakti kii krupa se hi utpann mana gaya he
 It is described in the Devi Purana that Purna Prakriti Jagadambika created three Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh and appointed them in the works of creation
 unhone hi brahama ko srujankarta, vishnu ko paalankarta tathaa apni icchaanusaar shiv ko sanhaarkarta hone kaa aadesh diya
 Before obeying the order, these three started doing penance to get those divine power as their wife
 jagdambika dwaara pareekshan main asafal hone ke kaaran brahma evam vishnu ko purna prakruti ansh rup main patni banakar praapt hui tathaa bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya se param prasann hokar jagdambika ne swayan janm lekar unki patni banane kaa aashwaasan diya
 Accordingly, on being inspired by Brahma ji, Daksha meditated on the same Purna Prakriti Jagadambika and pleased with his austerity, Jagadambika gave his boon to be born as his daughter and also told that when the virtue of Daksha diminishes that power After destroying the world, she will return to her abode
 ukt vardaan ke anuroop purna prakruti ne sati ke naam se daksh kii putree rup main janm grahan kiya or uske vivaah yogya hone par daksh ne uske vivaah kaa vichaar kiya
 Daksha did not understand the influence of Lord Shiva with his cosmic intelligence and considered his disguise immortal and did not consider him worthy of Sati
 atah unhone vichaar kar bhagwaan shiv se shunya swayamvar sabha kaa aayojan kiya or sati se aagrah kiya ki ve apni pasand ke anusaar var chun le
 Seeing Lord Shiva not present, Sati put the Varmala on the Earth by saying 'shivaay Namah' and Maheshwar Shiva himself attended and received that Varmala and returned to Kailash, making Sati his wife
 daksh bahut dukhi hue
 With Sati choosing her husband as her husband against her will, Daksha's mind was filled with anger towards them both
 isiilie baad main apni rajdhani main yojit viraat yajna main daksh ne shiv evam sati ko aamantrit nahin kiya
 Yet Sati stubbornly refused to go to the yagna of her father and showed him his terrible form by being extremely angry when repeated by Shiva
 isse bhayakrant hokar shivaji ke bhaagane kaa varnan hua he or unhen rokane ke liye jagdambika ne 10 rup dhaaran kiya
 Then on Shiva's asking, he introduced his ten forms
 phir shiv ji dwaara kshamaa yachana karne ke pashchaat purna prakruti muskura kar apane pita daksh ke yajna main jane ko utsuk hui tab shiv ji ne apane gamon ko kah kar bahusankhyak singhon se jute rath mangvakar us par asin karwaakar bhagwati ko sasamman daksh ke ghar bheja
 The rest of the story is often in line with the predetermined story with certain differences, but in this tale, the enraged Sati Chasati gets interrupted by ordering Leela and the talk does not end when that Chasati is consumed, but Shiva is pleased with the yagna of perfection
 After giving the hint, the corpse of Chasanti is safely and resplendently reunited in the Yajshala of Daksha and then by Goddess Shakti in the east
 Despite being told as Ishywani Cosmic Men like Shiva mourning and wandering like neurotic holding zombies head of Sati
 isse trast devataaon ko traan dilaane tathaa paristhiti ko sanbhaalane hetu bhagwaan vishnu sudarshan chakra se sati kii laash ko kramshah khand-khand kar katate jate hai
 In this way, due to the falling of various parts of Sati and ornaments at different places, those places became full of the glory of Shaktipeeth
 is prakaar 51 shaktipeethon kaa nirmaan ho gaya
 When Sati's body was no longer there, when Lord Shiva worriedly asked the gods, the gods told him everything
 is par nirishwaas chhodte hue bhagavan shiv ne bhagwaan vishnu ko treta yug main suryvansh main avatar lekar isi prakaar patni se viyukt hone kaa shaap de diya or phir swayan 51 shaktipeethon main sarvapradhan 'kamrup' main jaakar bhagwati kii aradhana kii or us purna prakruti ke dwaara agali baar himalay ke ghar main parvati ke rup main purnavatar lekar punah unki patni banane kaa var praapt hua
 Thus, in the next birth, Sati became the daughter of Himalayas in the form of Parvati and Lord Shiva again got her wife

 Eggs are laid in deep water with large gravel and require cold water and good flow of water for the developing embryo
 Mortality in the early stages of salmon life is generally high due to human-caused changes in natural prey and habitat, such as silt formation, high water temperature, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and river runoff Lack
 The estuaries and their associated wetlands provide salmon with a prime nursery area, before departing for the open ocean

 Another method of producing salmon that is safe but less controllable is to raise the salmon in the hatchery until they become large enough to be free
 They are then released into rivers, often in an attempt to increase the salmon population
 This system is referred to as animal husbandry and has been done long before in countries such as Sweden and Norway, but rarely by companies done privately, as they can be of economic benefit to anyone When a company limited the possibility of salmon return to eggs

 Water from the adjacent stream is poured from the pipe at the top of the channel and sometimes through the pond so that the sediment remains seated below
 The success of laying eggs is often more successful in the channel than the sidewalks, which is due to floods that can wash away natural reds for a few years

 rajeev laal kii maan uske liye ek ladki chunati hai, lekin rajeev ko vah pasand nahin aati
 He escapes to his mother's bungalow in Kashmir to escape from his anger
 vahaan use phool bechney vaali champa se pyaar ho jaataa he, lekin champa kaa baap shaadi se inkaar kar detaa he
 On the other hand, Rajiv realizes that his real mother is someone else
 rajeev - shammi kapur Maharani Ahilyabai was the wife of Khanderao, son of history-famous Subedar Malharrao Holkar
 janm inkaa san 1725 main hua tha or dehanth 13 agast 1795 ko; tithi us din bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi thi
 Ahilyabai was not the queen of a very heavy kingdom
 unka kaaryakshetra apekshaakrit simit tha
 Yet what he did, surprises him
 das-baarah varsh kii aayu main unka vivaah hua
 She was widowed at the age of twenty nine
 pati kaa swabhaav chanchal or ugr tha
 They tolerated all this
 phir jab bayalis-taintalis varsh kii thim, putr malerao kaa dehanth ho gaya
 When Ahilyabai was about sixty-two years old, Dauhitra Nathu passed away
 chaar varsh peeche damaad yashwantrao phanse na rahaa or inaki putree muktabai sati ho gai
 He had affection for Malharrao, the son of a distant relative Tukojirao; She used to think that in future it will handle the doors of governance, system, justice and prajaranjan; But he kept grieving them till the end
 ahilyabai ne apane rajya kii simaaon ke baahar bharat-bhar ke prasiddh tirthon or sthanon main mandir banawaye, ghat bandhwaae, kuon or baavadiyon kaa nirmaan kiya, maarg banawaye-sudharwaaye, bhukhon ke liye annsatr khole, pyaason ke liye pyau bithlaayin, mandiron main vidwaanon kii niyukti shastron ke manan-chintan or pravachan hetu kii
 And, by sacrificing the false temptation of self-respect, always tried to do justice - till death
 ye usee parampara main thim jisamen unke samakaleen puna ke nyaayadhish ramshastri the or unke peeche jhansi kii rani lakshmibai hui
 It was during her lifetime that the public began to understand and say 'devi'

 When there was a mess around

 People - ordinary householders, peasants, laborers - were sobbing in a very inferior state
 unka ekmaatr sahaara-dharm-andhvishwaason, bhay traason or rudhiyon kii jakad main ksaa ja rahaa tha
 There was neither power nor faith in justice
 aise kaal kii un vikat paristhitiyon main ahilyabai ne jo kuch kiya-or bahut kiya
 - She is memorable

 There is a difference of opinion regarding the importance of their temple building and other religious functions
 in kaaryon main ahilyabai ne andhadhundh kharch kiya or sena nae dhang par sangathit nahin kii
 Tukoji Holkar's army had to bear the brunt of the Northern Expeditions, sometimes it is alleged that these temples have been told the outposts of Hinduism
 tukojirao holkar ke paas baarah lakh rupye the jab vah ahilyabai se rupye kii maang par maang kar rahaa tha or sansar ko dikhalaataa tha ki rupye-paise se tang hoon
 Then what was the fault of Ahilyabai? The spirit of religion has been the biggest driving force for Hindus; Ahilyabai used the same
 tatkaaleen andhvishwaason or rudhiyon kaa varnan upanyaas main aayaa he
 One of these beliefs was to jump from a hill in the Narmada arrow near Mandhata and commit suicide to attain salvation
 ahilyabai ke sambandh main do prakaar kii vichaardhaaraen rahi hai
 In one, she has been given the title of incarnation of Goddess, in the second she has shown reverence for superstitions and stereotypes along with her superlative qualities
 vah andhere main prakaash-kiran ke samaan thim, jise andheraa baar-baar grasane kii cheshtaa karata rahaa
 Due to her excellent ideas and ethical conduct, she got the status of Goddess in the society

 Malharrao had also kept him with him forever and got ready for the reign
 ahilyabai ne inhen apana senapati banaaya or chouth vasuul karne kaa kaam unhen saunp diya
 Though Tukojirao Holkar was older than Ahilyabai at the age, but Tukoji considered her as his mother and used to do the work of the state with full devotion and truth
 ahilyabai kaa un par itnaa prem or vishwaas tha ki vah bhi unhen putr jaisaa maanati thim
 'khandoji Sut Tukoji Holkar' is said in the state papers wherever they are mentioned and also in the seals
 rajya kii chintaa kaa bhaar or us par praanon se bhi pyaare logon kaa viyog
 Ahilyabai's body could not handle all this grief
 or 13 agast san 1795 ko unki jivan-lila samaapt ho gai
 After Ahilyabai's death, Tukoji ascended the throne of Indore

 The foundation of the Umairids Empire was established by Prince Babur of the Timurid dynasty around the early 1500s, when he captured Doab and controlled the fertile region of Sindh and the lower valley of the Indus River by the eastern region of Khorasan
 1526 main, babar ne dilli ke sultaanon main aakhri sultan, ibrahim shah lodi, ko panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya
 To secure the establishment of his new kingdom, Babur faced a Rajput treaty in the Battle of Khanwa led by Rana Sanga of Chittor

 Babur's son Humayun succeeded him in 1530, but Pashtun suffered major reverses at the hands of Sher Shah Suri and effectively defeated most of the new empire before moving from territorial state
 1540 se humayun ek nirvasit shaasha bane, 1554 main safawid darbar main pahunche jabaki abhi bhi kuch kile or chote kshetra unki sena dwaara niyantrit the
 But when Pashtun fell into disarray after Sher Shah Suri's death, Humayun returned with a mixed army, mobilized more troops and managed to reconquer Delhi in 1555

 This dynasty is sometimes known as Timurid dynasty because Babur was a descendant of Timur

 He attacked parts of northern India and defeated the ruler of Delhi, Ibrahim Shah Lodhi in 1526 in the first battle of Panipat

 Over time, the kingdom established by Umer crossed the boundary of the Sultan of Delhi, eventually besieging a large part of India and earning the title of empire

 Akbar introduced certain important policies, such as religious liberalism, the inclusion of Hindus in the affairs of the empire and political alliances / marriage with the Hindu Rajput caste, which were innovative to their environment
 unhone sher shah suri kii kuch nitiyon ko bhi apanaaya tha, jaise kii apane prashasan main samrajya ko sarkaron main vibhajit karnaa
 These policies undoubtedly helped maintain power and the stability of the empire, were protected by two immediate successors, but were abandoned by Aurangzeb, who adopted a policy that had little place for religious tolerance

 This enterprise drained the resources of the empire which aroused strong resistance within the Marathas, Sikhs of Punjab and Hindu Rajputs
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal ke baad, samrajya main giravat hui
 Beginning with Bahadur Zafar Shah I, the Mughal emperors declined in power and became fictitious chieftains, initially controlled by various diverse courtesans and later by several rising chieftains
 18 veen shatabdi main, is samrajya ne persia ke nadir shah or afghanistan ke ahamed shah abdali jaise hamalaavaron kaa lut ko saha, jinhone baar baar mogul rajdhani dilli main lutpaat kii
 The Marathas were defeated before the British got most of the territories of this empire in India
 1803 main, andhe or shaktiheen shah alam II ne aupchaarik rup se british east india company kaa sangrakshan sweekaar kiya
 The British government had started calling the already weak Mughals the "king of Delhi" rather than the "emperor of India", which was formally exercised in 1803, which led to the uneasy implication of the Indian King moving on from the British Emperor

 He developed the soft vocabulary in Malayalam poetry which was till now considered only possible in Sanskrit
 iske liye unhone apane samay ke anukool sanskrit ke komal shabdon ko chunakar malayalam kaa jama pahanaaya

 While in Nalapat, she sometimes visited the Govindapuram temple there

 He has written dramatic dialogues by making mythological characters such as Parashurama, Vishwamitra, Vibhishan and Mahabali etc

 She had written many poems in her teens, which was published after her marriage in book form
 unke pati ne unhen sahitya srijan ke liye paryaapt avasar diya

 calcutta-vas's experiences greatly influenced his poetic consciousness

 Mahatma Gandhi's influence became unavoidable for him during the independence movement
 unhone khaddar pahani or charkha kata
 


 Amma does not go far for enjoyment and nectar even for paternity, because: Truth is as far away as it is near, tad duré, tadu endike: The poet Manas says - Give me the power to / i enjoy i can also share the portions / others

 It was included in the textbooks of the state of Kerala
 baad main unhone garbhadhaaran, prasav or shishu poshan ke strijanit anubhavon ko apni kavitaaon main piroyaa
 a decade later, he stepped out of the boundaries of home and family into the realm of spirituality
 tab tak yah kshetra unke liye aparichit jaisaa tha
 He got his initial knowledge of theosophy from his maternal uncle
 hindu shastron kaa sahaj gyaan unhen pehle se hi tha
 Therefore, the combined form of Theosophy and Hindu Manisha came in the form of his ideas in writing
 ammaa ke do darjan se adhik kavy-sankalan, kai gadhy-sankalan or anuwaad prakashit hue hai
 He started writing poems from a young age
 unki pehali kavita "kuppukai" 1930 main prakashit hui thi
 He was first conferred the "sahitya Kupuna Purasam" by Ram Varma Parikshit Thampuran, former ruler of the Cochin British Raj
 1987 main prakashit "nivedyam" unki kavitaaon kaa charchit sangrah he
 On the death of the poet NNN Menon, a collection of him as a mourning came from the name "lokanthangralil"
 unki kavitaayen darshanik vichaaron evam maanavtaa ke prati agaadh prem kii abhivyakti hoti hai
 He is referred to as "amma" and "dadi" in Malayalam-poetry because of his poetic love for children
 kerala sahitya academy, akhitam achyutan nambuthari main ek yaadgaar vaktavy ke dauraan unhen "maanav mahima ke nabi" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya tha or kavitaaon kii preranastrot kaha gaya tha

 The great work of n ॰ Narayana Menon called Kannuniratrulli Ashrubindu had a profound effect on Amma and helped her become a poetess
 mahakavi ve narayan menon unke mamaa en narayan menon ke samakaleen, maardarshak or ghanishtha mitra the
 Scholars like 'kuttikrishna Marar' and 'mukund Das' also used to come to his house
 ghar main saahitiyik charchaa kaa vaataavaran rahata tha
 She grew up in this environment
 sakshi or aswadika ke rup main ve vahaan upasthit rahati thim
 Mahakavi v Narayana Menon was one of the great poets in Malayalam literature who presented the mental sense of the human as a form of fantasy, which translated the Balmiki Ramayana in 1909
 1910 main "badhirvilapam" naamak vilaapkavy likhaa
 After that he wrote many dramatic expressions - Ganapathi, Bandhanasthanaay Anirudhan, Oru Kattu, Shishyunum Makanum, Magdalan Mari Yama, Achhukanum Makanum Kochusita etc
 san 1924 ke baad rachit sahityamanjariyon main hi vallattol ke deshbhakti se otprot ve kavyasuman khile the jinhone unako rashtrakavi ke pad par asin kiya
 Enre Gurunathan etc
 are highly popular in those expressions
 jivan ke komal or kaant bhaavon ke saath vicharan karnaa vallattol ko priy tha
 They did not have the tendency to stand and cry in darkness
 yah satya he ki patit pushpon ko dekhakar unhone bhi aahen bhari hai, parantu unpar ansu bahaate rahane kii banisbat viksit sumanon ko dekhakar ahlad prakat karne kii pravriti hi unamem adhik hai
 Part of his poetic courtesy can be seen in Amma's compositions
 ammaa kahati hai ki unke mamaa en narayan menon ke paas vishwa sahitya kii kai vishisht kritiyaan thim
 He was related to those works since childhood
 mahakavi rabindranath tagore krit 'di gardenar' or 'victor hugo krit 'las missrbalas' jaisi shreshth kritiyon se ve prabhavit hui thim, jo aage chalakar unki rachanaatmakataa ko dhar dene main sahaayak siddh hua
 Thus Amma has been highly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore, Victor Hugo, N
 Narayana Menon and V
 Narayan Menon in her literary life
 ammaa ne swatantraaa ke pehle kaa bharat bhi dekha or uske baad kaa bhi
 As a result, Amma, known as Vatsalya, Mamta, a poetess of the gentle spirit of humanity, tried to give a vision of the existential havoc, rudan within the then society, to be tested and compassionate, to overcome the darkness
 tees ke dashak kii unki kavitaaon main deshbhakti, gandhi kaa prabhaav or swatantraaa kii chaah spasht parilakshith hoti he
 During the Indian freedom struggle, he wore khaddar and spun spinning in his private life
 san 1929-39 ke bich likhi unki kavitaaon main deshbhakti or swatantraaa kii chaah spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Amma says that Gandhi was like a member of the Nalpat family
 unka agochar saannnidhya unhen unke har kriya-kalap ko prabhavit karata rahaa
 Then he was inspired to stay away from the pompousness
 ve narayan mendemma ke preranastrot Inspirators of Victor Hugoamma rabindranath tagoremma ke preranastrot Inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi apni aatmakathaatmak tippaniyon ke kram main ammaa ne sweekaar kiya he, ki kavy rachana ke kshetra main unke pati ve em nair ne unhen protsaahit kiya
 Their cooperation has received him continuously
 ammaa kahati hai ki- "I was not given a big responsibility in my in-laws' house
 bal-bacchon kii dekhbhaal, seva-tahal karne ke liye maan, daadi or sevikaayen thim

 They used to criticize him

 " ammaa ek sansmaran sunaati hui kahati hai, ki- "there was a controversy over whether Kashmir is a part of India or Pakistan
