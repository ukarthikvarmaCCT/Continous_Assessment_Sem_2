 1968 Name- Jagjivan Age- 28 years Ilazam - Bhabhi's murder in 37 years after 37 years
 
 
 2006naam-jagjivanumr 65 salfaislaa-supreme court ne jagjivan ke cese par sangyaan lekar use jail se reeha kar diya
 2014 Name - Jagjivan Age - 73 years alive but silently, due to a human mistake, the most beautiful 37 years of life were swallowed by the bars of prison
 37 saal baad adaalat ne us galati ko to sudhaar diya magar tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 With age, his voice has become almost silent
 kya is buudhe kii wo umr, umr se judi wo tamaam khushiyaan or uski wo aawaaj koi lautaa paaegaa?hindustan kya duniya kii kisi bhi adaalat ne ek katl ke liye kisi ek kaatil ko itani beraham sajaa nahi di hogi
 Bamshakkat imprisoned for 37 years
 ji haa puure 37 saalon tak wo bina kisi sunwaayee, bina kisi bahes bina kisi faisle ke salaakhon ke peeche kaid rahaa
 Do you know why? Because both the police and the court forgot to prosecute him for the entire 37 years after sending him to jail
 jagjivan pichley 37 saalon se bas salaakhon ko ghurta rahaa
 The bars remained the same during these 37 years, but yes its life got rusty
 bas yun samaj lijie ki jagjivan kii puri jindagi in bejaan salaakhon ne nigal leen
 What is the outside world like? What is the changing face of independent India? Humanity, love, kinship, emotion, which bird's name is not known
 pataa ho bhi to kaise? 37 baras se jo insaan giraft main ho wo aazaadee or aaazaad jindagi kaa matlab kaise jane?jagjivan kaid main isliye tha kyonki us par ek katl kaa iljaam tha
 Killed his sister-in-law and this murder was done 37 years ago
 yani 1968 main
 In Khandasa area of faizabad
 bas isi katl ke baad jagjivan kii badanasibi kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 On the basis of initial suspicion, immediately after the murder, Khandasa police arrested Jagjivan and sent him to jail
 magar jail jane ke kuch hi saal baad jagjivan kii dimagi haalat bigadanaa shuru ho gai lihaaja jila adaalat ne jagjivan kii maansik haalat ko dekhte hue use banaras ke maansik asapataal bhej diya
 With this court decree that the jail administration and the district police will report to the court every third month about Jagjivan's mental condition
 magar 37 saalon main ek baar bhi ye report court ke paas nahin pahunchi
 So with the passage of time, along with the jail administration and police, the court itself forgot Jagjivan
 jagjivan kii badanasibi kaa doosraa pahaludusraa pahalu to pehle vaale se bhi zyada beraham he
 The police and jail officials kept Jagjivan's family misguided about him from the beginning
 jab bhi jagjivan kii patni or betaa uski kheriyat jaanane jail jate unhen usase milane nahin diya jaataa
 How could we even meet? The prison officer himself had forgotten the point of sending Jagjivan from prison to Varanasi insane
 lihaaja lambey intjaar ke baad jagjivan ke gharavaalon ne ye soch kar sabar kar liya ki shaayad jagjivan ab is duniya main nahin rahaa
 On the other hand, Jagjivan's family was not getting the clue of Jagjivan and here Jagjivan was looking for them like crazy
 wo saalon jail se apane gharavaalon ko khat likhata rahaa
 But that letter never reached her house
 jagjivan ke aise hi ek khat kaa mazamoon kuch yun tha
 
 
 'always be happy Kishan's mother
 
 
 ham yahaan se kai patr tum logon ko likhe lekin tum logon tak nahin pahunchaa
 i do not feel like telling anyone
 isliye yahaan hamako sab log pagal samajhate hai
 These people have put us in a mental asylum
 tum logon kii bahut yaad aati he
 How are you ghar kaa kharchaa kaise chalata he
 Our son must have become young now
 kamata bhi hoga? itane saal biit gaye agar tum logon ko samay miltaa he to hamako yahaan se chhudaa kar le jaao
 'bless the hospital administration
 
 
 ek mulgim bina sunwaayee ke sajaa katata rahaa or police ke saath-saath jail prashasan chaiyn kin neend sota rahaa
 This sleep may have been longer but it was good for the hospital administration who reported the recovery of Jagjivan's mental condition to the jail authorities
 37 baras se apane mulgim ko bhul chuki adlaat or police prashasan ko jab jagjivan kii report mili to hadakamp much gaya
 The case was about messing with the law
 you ton har kaatil katl ke baad sajaa se bachane kii har koshish karata he lekin jagjivan ek anokhaa kaatil tha jo 37 baras se salaakhon ke peeche bina sunwaayee ke band rahaa or apane liye sajaa kaa intjaar karata rahaa
 After getting all the documents related to Jagjivan's trial, the police report got entangled in searching the files
 police ko 37 saal purana ricard talaashana tha magar jo log jagjivan ko bhul chuke the bhala unhe uski report kii kahaan sud hoti? jagjivan ko kaatil bataane vaali tamaam report thane to thane adalati filon se bhi nadaarad thi
 The hereafter had been reformed The witness was neither with the court nor with the police
 adaalat ke paas thi to sirf gavaahon kii ek fehrist
 The list through which the trial of the case was now being tried
 magar kamaal dekhie ki fehrist ke hisaab se jin gavaahon ko gavaahi ke liye bulaayaa janaa tha unamem se bhi ikkaa dukka ko chhodkar sabhi paralok sudhaar chuke the
 Well after the truth came out, the police and jail administration started searching for the case papers
 par cese ke kagajaat to nahin mili alabatta police ko ek adad kaagaj mila jisamen bas makatool kaa naam pataa darj tha
 
 
 
 jab ajtak ke lokapriy kaarykram jurm main jagjivan kii kahani dikhaai gayiis ek akele kaagaj ke dam par police or jail prashasan ne 37 saal baad jagjivan par mukademe kii karrwai phir se shuru karne kaa faisla kiya
 Aaj Tak got the idea of this decision in 2006
 isi ke baad ajtak ke lokapriy kaarykram jurm main jagjivan kii kahani dikhaai gai
 These pictures of Jagjivan were shot at the same time
 ittefaq se ye kaarykram jagjivan ko jaanane vaale kuch logon ne bhi dekha
 He then came to know for the first time that Jagjivan was not dead but still alive
 ajtak par khabar dekhne ke baad jagjivan ke gharavaale kareeb 30 saal baad pehali baar jagjivan se mili
 Later this news also became headlines for newspapers
 magar kamaal dekhie ki police or jail prashasan kii tamaam laaparvaahiyon ke baavjood jagjivan ko rihaai nahin mili
 Even though all the papers were missing, the witnesses were dead
 jagjivan kii sachai saamne aa chuki thi phir bhi adaalat ne use jamaanat par reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 It has been argued that he is the accused of murder and the decision of the case is yet to come
 par jagjivan kaa sach saamne aane ke baad ek bahes shuru ho gai
 The argument is that even if Jagjivan is a murderer and his crime is proved in the court, even then he probably would not have got more punishment than life imprisonment
 lekin is ek katl ke liye jisaki sunwaayee bhi abhi shuru nahin ho pai thi, jagjivan 3 umrakaid ke baraabar kii sajaa kaat chukaa he
 Is this justice? After the initiative of Aaj Tak, the issue was also hot in newspapers
 jagjivan ke saath hui ninsaphi kii baat sabhi maan rahe the
 But justice was not being done
 jagjivan ke ghar vaale zamaanat ke liye 37 saal bhi adaalat ke chakkar kaat rahe the
 The question was that the crime for which he would have been imprisoned for a maximum age of 14 years, he had already been punished three times more than that
 phir uske saath insaaf kahaan hua? yahi sawaal lekar jagjivan ke vakil desh kii sabase bady adaalat supreme court pahunche
 The law of the country clearly states that every criminal should be punished for his crime
 usase kam yaa zyada nahin
 Therefore, after hearing the story of Jagjivan and his case, the Supreme Court issued the decree of his release only on this basis
 or is tarah puure 37 saal baad jagjivan aaazaad ho gaya
 But look at the accusation that he was in jail for 37 years
 us katl kaa mukadmaa tab bhi puraa nahin hua tha
 After 37 years, Jagjivan returned home from jail
 
 
 37 saal pehle jab jagjivan jail gaya tha tab uskaa iklauta betaa keshav ram bas dedh saal kaa tha
 Keshav was nearly 40 years old when Jagjivan returned home from prison after 37 years
 naa sirf uski shaadi ho chuki thi balki uske paanch bachche bhi hai
 But could not see Jagjivan's son growing up and could not attend his marriage
 haalanki jagjivan ko jail se aaazaad hue ab aath saal ho chuke hai
 He was 28 when he went to jail
 jab reeha hua to 65 saal kaa or ab jagjivan kii umr 73 saal ho chuki he
 But that 37-year-old canker made such an impact on the hearts and minds of Jagjivan that he became silent as soon as he came out of jail
 uski awaz lagbhag gum si ho gai he
 On the one hand, inside the prison, for 37 years, Jagjivan was suffering the brunt of the fault of the system, on the other hand his family outside the prison was being shattered with each passing day
 is dauraan ghar main kitni hi khushiyaan or gam aae
 But there was only loneliness and weeds on Jagjivan's part
 yahi vajah he ki rihaai ke baad bhi 37 lambey saal kaa wo akelaapan aaj bhi jagjivan kii jindagi se dur nahin ho paaya he
 The prison boundary has destroyed not only Jagjivan's memory but also his emotion

 Hussain said that the Congress has not yet accepted the reality that it did not remain in power
 unhone kaha, ve (congress) netaa ab bhi apane sapanom main hai ki ve satta main hai
 They believe that by raising more questions and creating baseless issues, they will be able to divert attention to the people

 The history of Bihar in the Golden History of India
 chaahe uu nand vansh ke kaal hokhe yaa maury vansh ke kaal hokhe
 Even if the era of Gupta dynasty happened
 bihar i bhoomi hoi
 Where every form of Sun God was worshiped
 suryoday ke puja hovi, aar suryaast ke puja hovi
 People of Bihar should be opportunistic
 kuch apwaad chhod ke
 Podge says this and smiles
 bheed kaa shor tej ho jaataa he
 i know what you want to hear
 bihar ke samasya ke jad chai, simanchal ke samasya
 The entire Mithilanchal was plagued by floods
 bharat nepal samet ekda kosi ke rog ke vyavastha ho jaayin, te bihar khushhaal ho jaai
 Brothers and sisters, if you remember the Ramayana period, you remember Sita
 agar mahabharat kaal ko yaad karen, to karn kii yaad aati he
 If you remember the Gupta dynasty, then Chandragupta's politics inspires
 ganatantr kii baat karen, to aaj bhi vaishali kaa ganatantr puure vishwa main sirmaur he
 If we talk about the Emperor, even today, there is no memory after Emperor Ashoka
 aaj patliputra ko yaad karen to patna kii har gali yaad aati he
 If we talk about the era of knowledge, then Nalanda and Taxila are remembered
 ye meraa bihar he bhaaiyon
 And if you go to the modern era
 bharat kii aazaadee ke do mahatvapurn padaav
 Champaran Satyagraha of a Mahatma Gandhi
 doosraa, gujarat main gandhi kaa dandi yatra kaa kalkhand
 These are two important stages of independence of India
 bhaaiyon bahanon, aaj aap bihar main hunkaar raily kar rahe hai
 Hunkar rally
 ye hunkaar kiskaa he
 Repeat three times
 ye hunkaar hindustan ke karodon karodon garibon kaa hunkaar he, jo bihar se uthaa he
 Brothers and sisters, this is the land of Mother Sita
 or jab main sita mata kaa samaran karata hum
 When Sita Mata was kidnapped, all the apes set out to find Sita Mata
 lekin unako koi rasta nahin sujhata tha
 How to reach where to reach
 sita mata ko kaise khojein
 Then all the apes were in the wilderness
 tab us samay jamavant kii najar hanuman ji par padi
 And what Hanuman ji said to Jamwant at that time, brothers and sisters
 jamavant ne hanuman ko kaha tha, pavantanay ban pawan samaanaa, kaa chup saadhi rahe balvaanaa
 Brothers and sisters, this hunky rally is telling the whole country to be forced to silence
 mere deshavaasiyon, mere saath bologe
 You have to say hunkaar baro hunkaar baro
 Will you speak? main bol rahaa hum kaa chup saadhi rahe balvaanaa
 The public screams
 hunkaar baro hunkaar baro, desh hunkaar bharna chahta he or ise prerana dene kaa kaam bihar kii dharti se ho rahaa he
 This is the specialty of Bihar
 bharat ko jab jab jin chizon kii jarurat padi, bihar ne use puraa kiya
 When the country needed Lord Buddha, Bihar gave it to Lord Buddha
 jab desh ko bhagwaan mahavir kii jarurat thi, bihar ne bhagwaan mahavir die
 When the country was in need, this is the land of Patna, which gave the tenth Guru to Govind Singh
 sava lakh se ek ladaauun, tab guru gobind naam kahaaun
 And when the country was drowning in corruption
 loktantr khatm hone kii kagaar par tha
 Then this is Bihar, which gave Jayaprakash Narayan to the country
 2006-07 kii ghatana he
 Your Chief Minister, our friend came to Gujarat
 katha sunani he
 Yes to ek shaadi main aae the
 Were eating at a table
 hamaare mehmaan the
 We fed them fiercely
 dhokle
 Khaman, Gujarati Kadhi, all kinds of sweets
 itnaa gaurav hua tha ki unka pet bhi bhar gaya or man bhi
 This is the culture of this country
 hamane man se khilaayaa tha
 Friends are principles of public life
 aapane dekha hoga ki hamaare lalu ji mujhe gaali dene main kabhi mauka nahin chhodte
 He always said that i will never let Modi become PM
 lekin teen maheene pehle lalu ji ko akasmaat hua he
 Accident occurred
 hamaare mitra rudi ji ne bataaya
 i called Laluji at the same time and got his news
 haalchaal poocha
 i did not tell the media
 lekin main hairaan tha
 Lalu ji called the media and said, see the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 main itani gaali detaa hum
 Still after the accident my news asks
 maine kaha lalu ji, yaduvansh ke raja shri krishna bhagwaan hamaare gujarat ke dwarka main based the
 We are related to Yaduvansh
 gujarat dwarka aapaki dharti he
 It is natural for us to awaken love
 bhaaiyon
 i want to say to all the brothers and sisters associated with Yaduvansh, the descendants of Krishna God
 main dwarka nagari se krishna bhagwaan kaa aashirwad lekar aayaa hum
 i will worry about you, this is my promise
 bhaaiyon bahanon
 Sometimes twice a year, we have meetings of chief ministers
 piem us meeting ko bulaate hai
 The afternoon lunch is also from them
 piem kii teble par paanch chah siem baithte hai saath
 a year ago, on the pm's table, we and our Bihar Chief Minister came to the same table
 bhojan parosa ja rahaa tha, magar vah khaanaa nahin kha rahe the
 Was looking around here main piem ko dekhuun
 Look in front of them
 pareshaan ki baat kya he
 Got it again
 maine mere mitra ko kaha
 dont worry
 koi camere vaala nahin he
 Eat
 hippokrasi kii bhi seemaa hoti he
 Ha ha ha ha
 
 
 uske baad, jab main kahata hum ki kisi bhi haalat main bihar ko jangalraj se bachaana tha
 After that a coalition government was formed
 aaj main desh ke arthshaastriyon, political panditon kaa aahraavan karata hum
 As long as the JDU BJP government ran, if someone did the best work, the Vikas Yatra was carried forward, then the BJP ministers
 bihar ke sudhaar kii jo khabaren aane lagi thim, ve bhi bijepi ke mantriyon or vidhayakon kaa sankalp tha, usee ke kaaran hua tha
 Even after that
 ek baar sawaal aayaa
 There were two elections
 party ke saamne vishay tha
 Narendra Modi should be brought into election campaign from Gujarat
 media ne bhi bada vishay oochaal diya tha
 Our Bihar leader, he loved me so much
 ve mujhe bulaane ke liye itnaa aatur the
 Then i told Sushil ji, Nandkishore ji
 mujhe bulaane kaa aagrah mat kariye
 Our aim is just to not let Jungle Raj in Bihar
 modi apamaanit hota he to hone do
 If Narendra Modi lives outside Bihar then let it be
 bihar main jangalraj nahin aana chahie
 For us, there is more country than party
 isiilie meri party ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon kii ichha ke baavjood maine jangalraj na aae
 Therefore tolerated insults
 lekin bhaaiyon bahanon
 His intention was not noble
 ye hamaare mitra ko chele chapatton ne kah diya
 Get involved with Congress
 pradhanmantri banane kaa avasar he
 Started dreaming or unhone vishwasghaat bhaajapa se nahin kiya he
 The betrayal has been done by some of the people of Bihar
 ye vishwasghaat aapke saath he
 Brothers and sisters, i want to ask if this is a betrayal
 (bheed cheekhti he haa
 )
 vishwasghaat karne waalon ko aap sajaa doge
 Will clean up (the crowd again agrees
 ) champaran main gandhi ji ne angrej mukt hindustan kii baat kii thi
 Today, the bugle should be played from Gandhi Maidan that the dream of Congress-free India in India should be realized
 kal raat main tivi dekh rahaa tha
 Congress friends are upset
 modi shahjada kyon kah rahe hai
 Why has it come to light? agar main shahjade kahata hum to aapako bura lagata he, to is desh ko bhi is vanshavaad se bura lagata he
 Congress promises, it will leave dynasty
 main shahjada kahana chhod duungaa
 JP lived, struggled for democracy, and was willing to spend his life in prison
 loktantr ke chaar dushman hote hai
 Is an enemy
 parivaarwaad
 Dynasty
 jatvaad kaa jehar, satta kaa bhrashtachar or sampradayikta
 It is the misfortune of the country that all these enemies are emerging in the politics of Bihar today
 bharat sarkaar, upie sarkaar ke das saal puure hone ja rahe hai
 i want to ask jab pichhali baar chunaav main congress ke netaa aae the
 He said that inflation will be removed in 100 days
 congress ne vaada kiya tha
 Just answer aloud
 mahangaai hati
 Inflation decreased mahangaai badi
 
 
 Brothers, the Congress which has promised to you
 aaj das saal ho gaye
 They are sitting on the throne of Delhi
 kya unhen ghar bhejne kii naubat ai he
 Will you send them off aaj main saarvajanik rup se aahvaan karata hum
 You formed the government in 2004 in 2004
 kaaman agenda ke tahat aapane desh kii bhalaai ke liye baat kahi thi
 Eighty percent of the work that he was asked to do in the first hundred days was not done
 aise logon ko maaf karnaa chahie kya
 The Congress had said that after getting power, it would clean the Ganges
 aaj puraa ganga kaa pat dekh lijie
 In a way, it has kept its stronghold of diseases
 kya hamaari praan priy ganga saaf honi chahie ki nahin
 Congress should have fulfilled this promise or not
 mere noujvaan doston, ye congress ne kaha tha ki ve satta main aaenge or naujavaanon ko rojgaar denge
 He did not give, but increased inflation
 aaj garib ke ghar chulhaa nahin jalataa
 Children cry night and night
 maa aansu pikar sulaati he
 Whose sin is this? kya garib kii thali main roti nahin honi chahie
 brothers Sisters
 meraa kisaan aaj mahangaai kii maar se wo bhi mar rahaa he
 The way fertilizer prices are rising
 or ye sarkaar dekhie
 The farmer is not getting compost
 lekin aapke barauni main khaad kaa jo kaarkaana laga he, us par taale lage hue hai
 The country is at a loss
 lekin ye dilli kii sarkaar
 It neither cares for the farmer nor cares for the poor
 bhaaiyon bahanon
 a twenty-point program is run for the betterment of the poor in India
 har sarkaar use lagu karti he
 And the Government of India takes account of it every six months
 or uskaa report prakat karti he
 The first five places to implement it are the states ruled by the BJP
 lekin bihar kaa number
 Our friends talk about the poor
 biswein number par khadaa he
 These people bake bread in the name of the poor
 majaak bana rakhaa he
 The Planning Commission is headed by the Prime Minister
 vah kahata he ki agar aapaki ghar kii aay din bhar kii 26 rupee he
 He is not poor
 kya aap sahamat hai
 Hey, the family does not get tea for 26 rupees
 unka ek netaa kahata he ki paanch rupee main khaanaa mil jaataa he
 They do not know about poverty and hunger
 inhone garibi nahin dekhi
 We have seen poverty
 usamen paidaa hue hai
 Have lived mitron bihar ne dher saare rail mantri die
 Brothers and sisters, i cannot think of a railway minister
 main to railway ke dibbe main chaay bechate yahaan aayaa
 And the railway minister does not even know as much as the tea seller knows about the railway's troubles
 titi ko sanbhaalanaa padataa, guard ko sanbhaalanaa padataa
 Had to climb the train anyway
 maine sab sambhala he
 These people are talking about poverty
 'deene ilaahi kaa bedaag bedaa,wo duba dahaade main aakar ganga main aakar'ye takat he is jameen kii
 Bring Alexander here and hang him
 jis bhoomi ne sikandar ke itihaas ko tham liya
 On the same land, on the border of Hindustan, my land was protecting the land of Bihar
 pakistaniyon ne unhen maut ke ghat utaar diya
 They were martyred
 hindustan kaa har baccha, shaheedon ke liye gauravgaan karata he
 Takes inspiration lekin yahaan ek aisi sarkaar baithi he
 Whose minister says that he is known only to die in the army
 dub maro meri sena kaa apmaan karne vaale
 Hey enemies who kill army soldiers, they should raise their voice and you are saying that they go to die in the army
 bihar ke mere bhaaiyon
 Will tolerate insults
 nahin kaa shor
 Brothers and sisters, teach them such a lesson forever that you can never dare to insult them in times to come
 desh aaj parivartan chahta he
 Mud is being thrown at us from all the four sides
 koi baaki nahin rahaa
 Such an atmosphere has been created throughout the country
 lekin inako main kah rahaa hum ki jitna zyada keechad uchhaaloge, camel utana hi khilegaa
 Therefore, i am coming to ask you that today people with a new resolve say that today a historic rally has taken place here
 main kahata hum ki ye sirf aitihaasik raily nahin he
 This is the event that laid the foundation of new history
 or usee ghatana ko lekar ham jab aage pard rahe hai
 With renewed enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 bharat ke bhagya ko badalane ke liye ham aage badhen
 i am very grateful to you all
 bihar kii bijepi ne dilli sarkaar se pachaas hajaar karod kaa package maanga he
 This demand must be met
 aap likhakar rakhie, agar dilli jeet lee hamane, to 200 din kaa sawaal he
 The love Bihar has given us
 jo palak paanvade bichhaakar swaagat kiya he
 Friends, i never got such a fortune in my life
 main aapke pyaar ko byaj samet chukaayuungaa
 Our mantra is development
 sari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan he
 People who talk about Muslims
 unako bhi kahana chahta hum
 My Muslim brothers go for Haj pilgrimage
 har ek rajya kaa kota tay hua
 The quota for Muslims of Gujarat is four thousand eight hundred
 bihar ke liye saat hajaar se kuch zyada
 In Bihar, they are talking about communal harmony
 bihar kaa kota he saat hajaar kaa, jane waalon kii aplication aati hai sirf chah hajaar
 Why because the poor Muslims of Bihar have no money
 jayega kaise
 And the quota of Haj in Gujarat is four and a half thousand
 lekin arji aati he chalis hajaar kii
 Why do they come
 kyonki vahaan kaa musalmaan sukhi he
 Kutch and Bharuch district in Gujarat, which has the largest population of Muslims
 agar puure gujarat main kisi jile kii sabase zyada pragati ho rahi he, to vah inhen donon jilon kii ho rahi he
 They are throwing our opponents in the hands of the people
 main garib musalamaanon se
 i am asking poor Hindu brothers
 meraa garib hindu bhai bataae ki aapako musalamaanon ke khilaaf ladanaa he
 Or against poverty
 (bheed garibi ke khilaaf) main garib musalmaan se poochna chahta hum ki aapako hindu ke khilaaf ladanaa he
 Or against poverty (against crowd poverty), let us together fight against poverty
 aaj ye desh ko ulti salaah de rahe hai
 i have come to promise you main kehane aayaa hum
 Our government has only one religion and this religion is India first
 nesan first
 India is at the forefront
 sarkaar kii ek hi bhakthi he, bharat bhakthi, ek hi shakti he
 The power of a quarter billion people
 isi mantra ke saath aage badhanaa he
 Close both fists with me and speak with full force
 bharat mata kii jai
 
 
 The whole of India is watching you
 bolie vande maataram
 i have a small prayer
 aap yahaan se jaaenge
 Nobody will hurry
 gaanv tak salaamat jaayenge
 No worker should be harmed
 shanti se jaaoge
 You will not be in a hurry
 or duusari baat hamen shanti or ekta ko banaae rakhana he
 Peace should not hurt under any circumstances
 hindustan main kahin bhi shanti par chot nahin aani chahie
 Take this resolution and speak with full force

 Looking at the ground, it seemed that the new government was doing well
 pehali march ko gathit sarkaar kaa swaagat bemausam kii barfbaari se hua, lekin sadak saaf karne or raahat sevaaon ke liye fouran kaam shuru ho gaya
 But the previously announced contradiction between this mismatched coalition and the discomfort arising out of it has come to the fore
 sansad bhawan or dilli main televijan channelon ke studio main aarope-pratyarope kaa daur chal padaa he
 This noise of scattering peaked within just seven days of the coalition coming to power, when 42-year-old Masrat Alam was released on 7 March
 masarrat asal main saiyad ali shah gilaani ke algaavaadi hurriyat gut kaa duusari qatari kaa netaa he
 Masrat is alleged to have had a big hand in instigating demonstrations and stone pelting in the Kashmir Valley in the summer of 2010
 in ghatnaon main ghati main sau se zyada naujavaanon kii jaan chali gai thi
 Masrat was released on the basis of technical specifics, which began during the 49-day Governor's rule after the election results in December
 lekin mukhyamantri ne jab rajya ke police mahanideshak ke
 Rajendra was ordered to initiate the process of release of "all political prisoners", leaving Masarrat within three days to create uproar
 jammu main satta sukh bhogane kii aadat daal rahe bijepi ke mantri apane samarthakon ke rosh bhare pradarshnon se jaage
 a minister said that as soon as the news of Alam's release on television came, he "responded to angry calls on the phone of more than 100 people"
 maine logon ko itane aakrosh main kabhi nahin dekha tha
 "in the first week, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed continued to announce one-sided, one after the other
 pehle unhone vidhansabha chunaav main saamaanya se kahin adhik matdaan karaane main pakistan, hurriyat algaavvaadiyon or ugravadiyon ke sahyog kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya
 In both Jammu and Delhi, BJP leaders deliberately kept their ears closed and were "silenced" by the Chief Minister's statement
 pidipi ke kuch vidhayakon ne jab sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru ke avshesh lautaae jane kii maang kii or rajnatik bandiyon ke bare main mufti said ne jo bayaan die un par bhi aisi pratikriya nahin hui thi jaisi masarrat kii rihaai par hui
 After being completely engulfed in Parliament, Home Minister Rajnath Singh twice sought an explanation from the Jammu and Kashmir government
 desh bhakthi ke bare main apane kanaphodu upadeshon ke bich pradhanmantri modi ko bhi sweekaar karnaa padaa ki masarrat alam ko chhodie ke faisle par mufti sarkaar ne unki sarkaar se koi salaah mashvira nahin kiya
 When it came to know that the release of Masrat Alam, which had been closed under the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Protection Act since 2010, was the result of a process started during the Governor's rule, then the government was apparently embarrassed and Rajnath Singh had to say that his party along with PDP Will not hesitate to break the alliance
 unhone gajiabad main siif ke ek aayojan main kaha, ''meri sarkaar kisi keemat par rashtriya suraksha se koi samjhauta nahin karegi
 Government is not a priority for us, irrespective of the alliance
 "patrakaron ko yah baat kabhi nahin bataai gai lekin bijepi ke andruni sutron ke anusaar, adhyaksh amit shah ne mangalvaar ko phone par mufti said ko bhi itani hi sakht chetavanee de di thi
 He has also instructed BJP Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Kumar Singh and State President Jugal Kishore Sharma to closely monitor the moves of Mufti Saeed in the state
 in tamaam ghatnaon ke maddenjar grih mantralay jammu-kashmir sarkaar ke liye yah paraamarsh bhejne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he ki ''charchit maamalon" main band abhiyukton kii rihaai se pehle use suchit kiya jaae
 Now the question is, is the BJP serious about its threat to break away from Mufti Saeed? pdp's chief spokesperson Naeem Akhtar said, "I don't think they will be in such a hurry
" " ab nai sarkaar main mantri akhtar ne sabaki najaron main asambhav lag rahe gathbandhan ko jodne kii lambii or kathin prakriya kii taraf ishaara karte hue yah baat kahi
 Referring to the endless debate in the studios of TV channels, he says, "I just wish that our efforts to reconnect the Kashmiris with the rest of India on an emotional level do not go through television's TRP
" "lekin jammu main logon kaa aakrosh jhel rahe bijepi ke netaa uljhan main hai
 They believe that Mufti Saeed has not directly violated the coalition's agenda or the Common Minimum Program
 ek bijepi netaa ne safataur par kaha ki masarrat kii rihaai jaisi ''uksaane vaali" karravaayiyon ko dekhte hue yah gathbandhan jari rakhana, ''party ke liye nuksandeh hoga
 "there were signs of conflict in the alliance even when BJP leaders were aghast at the news that party general secretary Ram Madhav would meet Mufti Saeed to express his concerns
 jammu main party ke ek sadsy kaa kahana tha, ''ram madhav ke mufti se milane kii kya jarurat he? isse khamkhwaah unka bhav badhegaa
 "at the moment it seems that the reconciliation statements from both sides have calmed the matter
 mukhyamantri ne dilli ko bharosa dilaayaa ki salaah kiye bina ab koi rajnatik bandi nahin choda jayega
 State BJP general secretary Ashok Kaul has also said that his party "is not against the release of political prisoners who have no case registered
" " is mukaable main pehla daur said or pidipi ke haq main rahaa he or bijepi mushkil main he
 The decision to release Masrat is within the scope of Mufti Saeed's declared policy to talk to all parties related to Kashmir
 usase bhi badi baat yah he ki iske jariye yah sandesh diya gaya he ki mufti sarkaar, umr abdulla kii neshnal conference (jo masarrat ko logon se dur rakhana chaahati thi) sarkaar se alag he
 This also gave Saeed an opportunity to prove to his voters in the Valley that his dream of "self-governance" for Kashmir has not been undermined by alliances with the BJP
 unhen is maamle main centre ke saath koi bahut zyada samasya najar nahin aati thi, lekin bijepi ke hajme ke bare main mufti kaa akalan jahiraa taur par galat sabit hua lagata he
 Hizbul Mujahideen shot one of the three chief commanders - Ghulam Hasan Khan alias saif-ul-islam, Ghulam Rasul Dar alias Ghazi Naseeruddin and Abdur Rashid Pir alias Sardar Pir - during the operation to stop the disturbances in the Valley in 2003-04
 Went
 us samay mufti rajya ke mukhyamantri the
 PDP activists were targeted in the violence that followed this action but the muftis did not budge, for which Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government in Delhi at the time praised him
 yah baat kahin jaahir nahin hui lekin mufti ne centre ke madhyasthon, khaskar khufia agenciyon ke saath avaidh najarbandiyon ko rokane kii saudebaaji kar lee thi
 They were also successful in getting Gilani out of precautionary detention
 lekin hijbul mujahidin cmanderon ke safaaye ke baad vaajapeyi se mufti said ko jaisi daad mili thi waisi modi sarkaar main dilli se milane kaa ab tak koi saboot nahin he
 His current confrontation with the BJP may have calmed down by mutually acceptable consent, but it has increased the stature of the Chief Minister in the entire valley

 N
 suhail kaa maananaa he ki mufti said logon ko ye dikhaane main kaamyaab rahe hai ki ''lambey samay baad ve pehle mukhyamantri hai jo dilli se nahin darate
 "in this way, the Mufti will certainly benefit greatly in any of the next elections, and especially in the event that the PDP-BJP alliance collapses prematurely
 bhartiya janata party ke ek netaa ne apni pahchaan na bataane kii shart par kaha, ''jammu-kashmir ke rajnatik sameekaran se bijepi kaa hameshaa ke liye safaya ho saktaa he
 "minister in the Mufti government, Naeem says," Mufti saheb is certainly not thinking about a new election
 " modi ke netritv main bijepi ke saath gathjod ke mufti ke faisle ko ''saahasik lekin sochi-samajhi chaal" bataate hue naeem kaa kahana he ki gathjod tootna mukhyamantri kii ''nijee asafalataa" hogi

 The Punjab and Haryana High Court has given time to present Swayambhu Sant Rampal in a contempt case till Monday after which authorities imposed prohibitory orders at several sensitive places

 In view of the presence of women supporters, the women police has also been called

 Along with this, 20,000 commandos of Rampal are also deployed to prevent his arrest

 On the orders of the Police High Court, Rampal is set to be arrested and produced in court till Monday, while Rampal's supporters do not want to let him be arrested at any cost
 is bich rampal ashram ke prashasan ne sarkaar ko chaar vikalp die hai
 According to him, if Rampal is cured by Monday morning, he will go to Chandigarh and if his health is not well then try to take a statement through video conferencing
 ashram prashasan kii maang he ki court rampal ko nijee peshi se raahat de de yaa phir court punarvichaar karen or peshi ke liye duusari tarikh de
 Meanwhile, sources are stating that there is little chance of court relief from private appearance and the possibility of video conferencing is less, as Rampal supporters had created a ruckus during the video conferencing earlier on July 14
 
 isse pehle haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ne shanivaar ko rampal se shantipurna tareeke se or bina kisi avrodh ke khud adaalat main pesh hone ke liye apil karte hue kaha tha ki har kisi ko nyaayik tantra kii garima ko sarvocch sthaan dena chahie

 Earlier, the administration stopped the supply of water and electricity to the ashram
 police is par bhi najar rakhe hue he ki rampal ke anuyaayi chandigarh kii ore nahin ja paaen
 This could lead to law and order problem in view of the court hearing on Monday

 jisamen mayawati ko samta mulak samaaj kii aradhy devi kaha gaya he
 Apart from these, there are many leaders who were sometimes projected in posters or sometimes in hoardings by making a goddess or deity
 kai baar netaaon par chalisa likh di gai to kabhi aarti
 When big leaders are to come into the eyes of politics, by doing such actions many people succeed in their cause
 yahi vajah he ki kai netaa bhi jite ji 'bhagwaan' kaa darja paa gaye
 And this continues
 kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki uttarakhand main 'himalay adhyayan' ke liye ek rashtriya centre kii sthapana kii jaaegi

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle mumbai congress anduruni gutbaji se juujhati hui najar aa rahi he
 Milind Deora, considered close to Rahul Gandhi, has rebelled against the leadership of Mumbai Congress President Sanjay Nirupam
 devda ne kaha he ki party main jo kuch chal rahaa he, usase wo bilkul bhi khush nahin hai
 With this, the infighting of Mumbai Congress can be understood very well
 aise main 2019 ke chunaav main narendra modi ke netritv vaali bijepi se congress kaise muqabla karegi?bataa den ki milind devda ne twit karke kaha he ki sanjay nirupam kisi ko saath lekar chalanaa nahin chaahate, jo party ke liye chunaav se pehle ghaatak he
 This has never happened in the Mumbai Congress before
 desh kii aarthik or saanskrithik shahar mumbai main hamen logon ko saath laane kii jarurat he
 The Mumbai Congress cannot be a cricket pitch for communal politics in which leaders are pitted against each other
 unhone aage ke twit main likhaa, 'jo ho rahaa he usase main niraash hum or party loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke mere rukh se avgat he
 However, i have full faith in the central leadership and the ideology and principles of our party
 vishesh taur par mumbai main, jahaan congress kaa janm hua
 Actually, the politics of the Mumbai Congress is already divided into two factions
 ek dhade kii aguwai gurudas kaamat karte rahe to doosraa gut murali devda kaa tha
 Currently, Milind Deora is handling the political legacy of Murali Deora
 agast, 2018 main gurudas kaamat kaa nidhan ho gaya he
 In this way some people of Kamat group have joined with Milind and some have joined with Mumbai Congress General Secretary Dharmesh Vyas
 sanjay nirupam ke shivasena se congress main aane or mumbai adhyaksh banane ke baad unhone gurudas kaamat or murali devda gut ke logon ko darkinar kar apni team khadi kii he
 Nirupam has emerged as the face of the Congress in Mumbai, having struggled in opposition as the Mumbai Congress President
 maharashtra kii chaahe bijepi sarkaar ko gherna ho yaa modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf sadak par utarkar andolan karnaa ho
 They are doing both these things continuously
 dilachasp baat ye he ki in sab andolanon main sanjay nirupam kaa saath dene sadak par koi bada congressi cheharaa najar nahin aayaa
 For the past 6 months, several delegations have met the Congress high command and complained against Sanjay Nirupam's increasing supremacy, but they have not been successful so far
 itnaa hi nahin sitambar 2018 ko maharashtra ke congress prabharee mallikarjun khadge se mumbai main milind devda ke netritv main congress netaaon ne mulaakaat kar sanjay nirupam ko mumbai congress adhyaksh pad se hataae jane kii baat rakhi thi
 After meeting Mallikarjun Kharge, the disgruntled leaders expected the high command to take some action against Nirupam, but nothing happened
 isi ke baad se asantosh or bhi zyada bad gaya
 In fact, Mumbai north-west Lok Sabha seat is also considered to be a major reason for Milind Deora's confrontation with Sanjay Nirupam
 gurudas kaamat isi seat se chunavi maidan main utarate rahe hai, jis par sanjay nirupam daawa kar rahe hai
 Kripashankar Singh also wants to contest elections on this seat
 haalanki, sanjay nirupam 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main isi seat se maidan main utarana chaahate the, lekin kaamat ke dabaav main mumbai uttari seat se chunaav maidan main utarane par raji hue the
 Now Nirupam is claiming from Kamat's parliamentary seat in the 2019 Ran
 aise main milind ko krupa shankar singh kaa saath bhi mil gaya he or unhone sanjay nirupam ke netritv ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaa diya he
 This clearly shows that internal factionalism in the Mumbai Congress is flowing above the danger mark
 vivaadaaspad video assistant referi technology (VAR) rus main 2018 world cap ke dauraan debyue karegi, jisamen referi apni unguliyon se screen kaa sanket banaakar video referi se salaah le sakate hai
 Most countries are theoretically aware of VAR after experimenting at various FIFA tournaments, Italy's Siri a and Germany's Bundesliga
 kya he VAR technology?vieaar kaa istemaal chaar sthitiyon main kiya ja saktaa he- gol hone ke baad, penlti se jude faislon par, red card se jude faislon par yaa phir card dikhaae jane ke dauraan khilaadi kii galat pahchaan ke maamle main
 Messi, who was a victim of dwarfism in childhood, is the world's best footballer
 Benefits of VAR During the VAR training program at the Italian National Training Center in Coviciano near Florence, FIFA referee committee chairman Peerluigi Colina said, 'it is aimed at big and common mistakes
 It is to avoid, its goal is never to see every small incident
 ’rus main 13 referi sirf ‘control screen’ ko dekhne kaa kaam karenge or pich par adhikari kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye chune gaye lagbhag 35 referi main se prayek ko ek yaa isse adhik match main video referi kii bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 Netherlands referee Björn Kuipers said, 'VAR can be our best friend, now it is not possible to make a big mistake
 ’ Virat Kohli's unbeaten 133 helped India register a seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the crucial one-day cricket match of the tri-series and the batsman called it the best innings of his international career
 kohli ne match ke baad patrakaron se kaha, ‘yah mere karier kii sarvshereshth pari honi chahie
 In the situation we were in, we needed bonus points while chasing 320, so it was an important match and after playing such innings at the right time, i think it was a great innings for me
 ’yah poochne par ki kya yah pari unke aalochakon ko karaara jawaab degi to unhone kaha ki isse adhik yah pari khud ko sabit karne ke liye thi
 Kohli said, 'there are always critics, this innings was more than that to prove themselves
 agar aap acha khelte ho to aap team ko jeet kii ore le jate ho
 It looks really good playing the innings
 ’unhone kaha, ‘perth main meri pari se pehle main soch rahaa tha ki media main kya chal rahaa hoga lekin iske baad maine khabaren dekhnaa band kar diya
 i told myself to think positively and that there is no reason not to score runs
 maine bharosa banaaye rakhaa or mujhe lagata he ki yahi mahatvapurn tha
 Kohli said that he had made some mistakes in the previous matches of the tri-series which tried to improve here
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley maichon main maine kuch galtiyaan kii tathaa 20 or 30 ran banaakar out hua
 i tried to play every ball and that is not always the case in international cricket
 yah sambhavat: vanade main meri sarvshereshth pari he
 This is a very special feeling
 ’srilankai captain mahela jayavardhane ne kaha ki jab kohli jaisaa khilaadi ballebaaji ke liye adarsh pich par is tarah kaa pradarshan kar rahaa ho tab koi bhi kuch nahin kar saktaa
 He said, 'you can't do anything when he is batting like this
 toornament main pehali baar hamaare gendbaajon ne kharaab pradarshan kiya
 Not only Kohli, other batsmen also showed excellent game
 ’ jayavardhane haalanki finels ke liye kwalifai karne ke prati aashwast dikhe
 He said, 'to qualify is still in our hands, which is good
 ummid he ki ham is haar se ubarkar melbern main jeet darj karenge
 ' master blaster sachin tendulkar ne bhi twitor par khol liya he khaataa
 In his first message, Sachin has congratulated Team India for the World T20
 yahi nahin kuch tasviren bhi post kii hai jinamein sachin bindaas andaaj main hai jabaki ek tasviir main wo filmkaar vidhu vinod chopra ke saath hai
 More than 20 years have passed, but if not changed, this style of master blaster, this style of bashing of the bowlers of the opposing team has made people crazy with the passing years, the number of master's wishes has increased, the phase of change i did not change my original style of play in the game, but one thing has definitely changed
 ab sachin bhi twitors kii jamaat main ho gaye hai shaamil
 Sachin has opened an account on social networking site Twitter
 twitor par master kaa pehla paigaam team india ke saathiyon ke naam he jo is vakt world tii-20 kaa muqabla khilne gaye hai
 The real SRT has finally come on Twitter, writes Sachin
 sabase pehle main apane un saathiyon k ol da best kahana chahta hum jo westeindies main hai
 Obviously, this is no less than good news for Sachin's fans, who are restless to know every little thing about their superhero, because this superhero is the God of cricket in their eyes
 madhya pradesh ke do divasiy pravaas ke dauraan congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa diggajon se lekar nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko ekajute hone kaa paath or ise yaad na rakhane par satta se dur rahane kii chetavanee rajya main guton kii aguwai karne waalon ko kitna yaad rahegi, ye sawaal uthne lage hai
 The Congress has become synonymous with factionalism in the state
 beete teen dashakon main upar se shuru hui gutbaji kii beemaari gaharaa chuki he
 This is the reason that at the grassroots level, the worker is identified more as a Congress worker than as a less factional leader
 yahaan kaaryakarta pehle gut kaa he or uske baad congress kaa
 Assembly elections are going to be held in the state this year
 is chunaav ke liye congress kaaryakarta kitne taiyaar hai or jamini hakeekat kya he, isi ke maddenjar rahul gandhi kaa do divasiy pravaas hua
 He held classes in Mohankheda and capital Bhopal of Dhar district, from sitting mps, mlas, loser candidates, office bearers up to the development block, as well as representatives of panchayat and urban bodies
 is class main logon ko khub khulkar apni baat kehane kaa mauka mila
 This was the reason that many activists said what they could not muster the courage to say, regardless of the upcoming bad results
 guton kii aguwai karne vaale netaa digvijay singh, kamalnath, jyotiraditya sindhiya, kantilal bhuriya or suresh pachori ke naamon kaa in kaaryakartaaon ne khulkar zikr kiya
 It was even said that due to these leaders, the party loses
 vibhinn str ke pratinidhiyon dwaara kahi gai baat gandhi ke dil ko chhu gai
 This was the reason that in front of the elected representatives of panchayat and urban body in Bhopal, they discussed factionalism
 saath hi bharosa dilaayaa ki ab party kii ummidavaari kuch netaa tay nahin karenge, balki jila va block str ke padaadhikariyon kii isamen ahm bhoomika rahegi
 On one hand, while Rahul Gandhi assured the lower level officials to get importance in the party, on the other hand, he also warned the big leaders
 unhone saaf kaha ki agar gutbaji bani rahi to rajya main jeet sapana hi rah jaaegi
 In such a situation, it is not easy to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 jeet kaa mantra sirf ekajutata hi he
 Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ajay Singh also believes that Gandhi has given warning and advice to the leaders
 saath hi kaha he ki praathamikta congress kii majbootee or jeet kii he, uske baad hi kuch or he
 The party will give tickets three months before the assembly elections with the consent of the lower level workers
 aisa hone se party ko laabh hoga
 During this visit, Rahul taught solidarity from the workers to the leaders and instructed to end factionalism, but Rahul does not know that it is not so easy to end factionalism in the state
 yahaan ke netaaon kii netagiri isi gutbaji se chalati he
 Due to factionalism, he remains a big leader
 chunaav kareeb hai, isliye netaaon ko padhaaye gaye paath ko to yaad rakhana hi hoga magar koun kitna yaad rakhata he, iskaa abhi se anumaan nahin lagaaya ja saktaa

 jaise satyagrah se desh aaazaad hua tha, vaise hi aaj hamen swatchtaagrah se desh ko gandagi mukt karnaa he

 jis din edilade main bharat test match haara usee din champions trophy main bhartiya hockey team ko pakistan ke haathon haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Both Indian sports-lovers are undoubtedly disappointed by the defeat
 lekin khel-premiyon ko usase bhi bada dhakka is baat se lag rahaa he ki antarrashtriya hockey parishad (ex) ne unhen nazarandaaz kar diya
 After the Hockey match in Bhubaneswar, the FIH showed the attitude that perhaps what happened on the field may have been the fault of the fans or maybe it is not as big as many people think
 edilade main isisi ne bhartiya captain viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan par jurmaana lagaaya gaya kyonki aapas main jhagad kar inhonen apane vyavhaar se khel bhaavana par chot pahunchaai thi
 Hardly any Indian cricketer created a ruckus about it
 usee din pakistan ke hockey khilaadiyon ne bhubaneshwar ke khelpremiyon ke saamne maryaada kii simaaen tod deen
 However, the FIH was quick to decide on this
 unhen nahin laga ki phans se abhadrata ke liye unhen kadi karrwai kerani chahie
 The problem is that FIH is trying to popularize hockey
 is koshish main wo bharat ko apana stratagic partner maanata he yani ranneeti ke taur par bharat kaa role behad ahm samajhataa he
 FIH President Leandro Negre also expressed happiness over the behavior of Bhubaneswar hockey lovers a day earlier
 lekin inhen phans ke khilaaf khilaadiyon kaa vyavhaar unhen utana nahin akhra ki uske khilaaf kadaa faisla len
 Actually these officials and players are making the mistake that they do not understand the true meaning of the fans
 kisi bhi khel ki asli taaqat uske phans hi hote hai, jis din unhone khel kaa saath choda us khel ko apana vajood bachaana mushkil ho jayega
 There is no need to find an example in India and other countries of the world
 isliye in khelon ke liye behatar yahi hoga ki wo khel premiyon kaa sammaan karnaa seekhen, kam se kam bhuulakar bhi apmaan to naa hi karen

 Apart from this, the entire politics of BJP has moved forward with the help of Ayodhya
 maujuuda samay main desh or soobe donon jagah bijepi kii sarkaar he
 In such a situation, Akhilesh is trying to beat him with the weapon of the BJP
 akhilesh ne ram nagari kii sadakon par utarkar bataa diya he ki sangharsh or ram bharose wo 2019 main bijepi kaa saamana karenge
 Akhilesh also made nationalism the weapon Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in the Mann Ki Baat program only last week that the month of August is a month of revolution in some way
 is maheene ko kranti ke maheene ke rup main manaaya janaa chahie, taaki desh kii yuva peedi aazaadee ke liye die gaye balidaan ko samaj sake

 Till some time people were looking at Nitish Kumar as the face of the opposition, but this place is completely empty due to his union with the BJP

 sapa netaa rajendra choudhary bhi yahi daawa kar rahe hai ki akhilesh yadav saaf suthri chhavi ke netaa hai, unhone paanch saal upi ke mukhyamantri rahakar jo vikaas ke kaam kiye hai, utana kaam pichhali kisi bhi sarkaar main nahin ho sakaa he

 He can go with anyone to defeat the BJP

 Political parties are busy finalizing their preparations
 siyasat ke nae sameekaran ban rahe hai or tamaam chote dal ek duusare se gathbandhan kar apni takat badhaane main jute hai

 The survey results show that there has been a huge difference in the number of votes in 2019 as compared to 2014
 2014 main endie ko 38 fisadi vot mili the jabaki upie ke hisse main mahaj 23 fisadi vot aae the
 Other parties had 39 per cent votes then
 ham jaanate hai ki is vot pratishat ne bijepi ke netritv vaale endie ko centre main baari bahumat dilaayaa tha or narendra modi pradhanmantri bane the
 After that every six months, this vote percentage changed in the mood of Aaj Tak's survey country

 The remaining 32 percent of the vote is going to other parties

 sabase zyada nuksaan bijepi ke netritv vaale endie ko ho rahaa he or uski siten 99 ghatakar 237 tak simat sakati hai
 The UPA seems to be making a comeback but is far from power
 uski siton main 106 kaa ijapha ho rahaa he or use 166 siten milane kaa achumaan he
 Other parties are also suffering
 wo 140 siten jeet sakate hai jabaki pichhali baar udhaka ye aankada 153 tha
 It is clear from the results of the survey that the NDA is projected to lose three per cent of the votes in 2019 as compared to 2014, while the upa's account is going full 10 per cent additional votes and they get 33 per cent votes in 2019 as compared to 23 per cent in 2014

 i said the same, not that i did not give time to anyone
 or ab main is stage par hum, jahaan mujhe dena nahin aata
 i struggle
 main kaam main bada expressive hum par jaati rishton main, pataa nahin
 "" i couldn't
 aaj main koshish bhi karata hum to saamne, aisa lagata he efort kar rahaa hum
 i will sit in front, but in silence
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki kya chahie unako or kaise duun? or kaise kanve karun ki wo jaruri hai mere liye
 
 
 And where there is no pay emotion, i do it all over
 "mere paas sevings nahinfuture plance or mumbai chhodane ke sawaal par anuraag ne kaha, "main aage kaa nahin sochataa
 i do not have future plans at all
 main sevings nahin karata
 i will travel whenever i get time
 ""main jab kaam nahin hota he tab chhod (mumbai ko) detaa hum
 Work happens only when i am in Mumbai
 nahin to baahar rahata hum, ghumta rahata hum
 i love solitude
 ekant main kuch bhi nahin karata hum
 Sometimes i study, sometimes i am watching something, sometimes i do nothing
 baitha rahata hum ghanto bas
