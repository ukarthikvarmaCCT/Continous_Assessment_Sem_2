greekon ko bhagane ke baad hi angrejon ke haath se baaki hisse nikaalane kaa prashn tha
 The country was with them, in addition, Britain was no longer ready to fight
 is kaaran yah samasya bhi sulajh gai
 Kamal declared the country democratic and became the first President himself
 ab rajya lagbhag nishkantak ho chukaa tha, par mullaon kii ore se unka nirantar virodh ho rahaa tha
 Kamal started campaigning against Islam in government newspapers
 ab to dharmik netaaon ne unke viruddh fatve jari kar diye or yah kahana shuru kiya ki kamaal ne angora main striyon ko parde se baahar nikaal kar desh main aadhunik nrity kaa prachaar kiya he, jisamen purush striyon se satakar naachte hai, iskaa ant hona chahie
 This voice was raised from every mosque
 tab kamaal ne 1924 ke march main khilaafat pratha kaa ant kiya or turki ko dharm-nirpeksh raashtra ghoshit karte hue ek vidheyak sansad main rakhaa
 Most parliamentarians opposed it, but Kamal threatened them with a tight end
 unki is dhamkee kaa purajor asar hua or vidheyak paarit ho gaya
 But the fire of insurgency within the mullahs kept on burning
 kamaal ke kai bhootpurv saathi mullaon ke saath mil gayi the
 These people also took money from foreign capitalists
 kamaal ne ek din inke mukhya netaaon ko giraftaar kar phaansi par chadha diya
 Kamal saw that hanging only will not do, the country has to be educated modernly and not only the old customs, the dress etc
 has to be abolished
 kamaal ne pehla hamalaa turki topi par kiya
 It revolted, but Kamal sent an army
 iske baad inhone islamic kanoonon ko hataakar unke sthaan par ek nai samhita sthapit kii jisamen switzarland, germany or italy kii sab acchhee-acchhee baaten shaamil thim
 Multiple marriages were outlawed
 iske saath hi patiyon se yah kaha gaya ki ve apni patniyon ke saath dhoron kii tarah-vyavhaar na karke barabari kaa bartaav rakhen
 Everyone was given the right to vote
 sevaaon main ghoose lenaa nishiddh kar diya gaya or ghoosekhoron ko bahut kadi sajaayen di garin
 The curtain was lifted from the women's attire and the men began to wear suits leaving the old fashioned passages
 isse bhi bada sudhaar yah tha ki arabi lipi ko hataakar puure desh main roman lipi kii sthapana kii gayi
 Kamal himself went on the streets and taught Turkish language in Roman alphabet
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki sara turki sangathit hokar ek ho gaya or algaav kii bhaavana samaapt ho gayi
 Simultaneously, Kamal organized the Turkish army in a very modern manner
 is prakaar turk jati kamaal pasha ke kaaran aadhunik jati bani
 By the time Mustafa Kamal Ataturk died on the 10th of November, 1938, his name as the creator of modern Turkey had shone like the sun in the world
 vaise to kamaal pasha ke jivan main chaar striyon ke saath uskaa prem prasang chalaa kintu shaadi usne keval latifi ussaki se hi kii
 Although she did not have any children, and she died childless
 bibi ke marane ke baad mustafaa kamaal pasha ne kabhi vivaah nahin kiya
 To overcome the isolation of life, he adopted thirteen orphans and raised them in a better way

 In ancient Sanskrit texts, 'northern India' is called Aryavarta
 rugveda main aaryon kaa nivasasthal "saptsindhu" pradesh ke naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 The riverside of the Rigveda has an aggregated description of the rivers flowing in the Aryanivas, the main ones being - Kubha, Krugu, Gomti, Indus, Parushni, Shutudri, Vitta, Saraswati, Yamuna and Ganga
 yah varnan vaidic aaryon ke nivasasthal kii seemaa kaa nirdeshak mana ja saktaa he
 In the Brahmin texts, the Kuru Panchal country is considered to be the center of Aryan culture where this land was called "prajapati's navel" by the legislation of many yagyagas
 shatapath brahman kaa kathan he ki kuru paanchal kii bhashaa hi sarvottam tathaa pramanik he
 In the Upanishads period, the progress of Aryasabhaya spread to Kashi and Videha districts
 falat: punjab se mithila tak kaa vistrut bhubhag aaryon kaa pavitra nivas upanishdon main mana gaya
 The extent of Aryavarta in the Dharmasutras differed greatly in the subject
 vashishthadharmasutra main aryaavart kii yah prakhyat seemaa nirdhaarit kii gai he ki yah adarsh ke purv, kaalak van ke pashchim, paariatr tathaa vindhyas ke uttar or himalay ke dakshin main he
 The other two opinions are also mentioned here that Aryavarta is the terrain between the Ganges and the Yamuna and the Krishna deer performs uninterrupted transmission in it
 boudhayan, patanjali tathaa manu ne bhi vasishthokt mat ko hi pramanik mana he
 In Manu's vision, Aryavarta is very similar to Madhya Pradesh and has a small, but holiest terrain called "brahmavart" within it, which is confined by the rivers Saraswati and Drishdwati, and the traditional ethos is considered ethic
 aryaavart kii yahi pramanik seemaa thi or iske baahar ke desh mlechh desh maane jate the, jahaan tirthayatra ke atirikt jane par ishti yaa sanskaar karnaa aavashyak hota tha
 The countries of Avanti, Anga, Magadha, Surashtra, Dakshinapatha, Upavritta, indus-sauvir etc
 have been counted in the Mudcha countries in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra
 parantu aaryon kii samskruti or sabhyataa brahmanon ke dharmik utsaah ke kaaran anya deshon main bhi faili jinhen aryaavart kaa ansh kaa na maananaa satya kaa aplaap hoga
 Medhatithi's opinion on this subject seems very rational
 unka kahana he ki ""jis desh main sadaachari kshatriya raja mlecchon ko jitkar chaaturvarnya kii pratishtha kare or mlecchon ko aryaavart ke chandalon ke samaan vyavasthit kare, vah desh bhi yajna ke liye uchit sthaan he, kyonki prithvi swat: apavitra nahin hoti, balki apavitron ke sansarg se hi dooshit hoti he"" 
 Such conquered Mlechcha countries are also biased to consider Medhatithi Aryavarta
 samskruti kii pragati kii yah maang thukraai nahin ja sakati
 That is why Mahabharata Punjab, which was once the center of Vedic period of Aryan culture, is not worth staying for even two days, because in the era of purity due to the influence of the Yavan, it had become extremely ethics in that era
 aryaavart hi guptkaal main 'kumari dweep' ke naam se prasiddh tha
 In the Puranas, Aryavarta is specifically referred to as "bharatavarsha"
 mauris epa

 Walter Elias "walt" Disney was an American filmmaker, director, story writer, backstory, animator, entrepreneur, entertainer, international icon and philanthropist

 These are the latest styles and techniques in illustration and sculpture
 iske prachaarkon or kalakaaron main chiriko, daalon, moro, arp, breton, maasan aadi pradhan hai
 In 1924, André Breton made a philosophical representation of this creation in art in his Surrealist Declaration
 atiyatharthwaad kala kii, saamaajik yatharthwaad ke atirikt, naveenatam style he or idhar, manovigyaan kii pragati se prabhavit, prabhoot lokapriy hui he
 The theory of surrealism was expressed by its promoters as follows: Surrealism is beyond reality, audio-visual-world
 yah vah param yatharth he jo avchetan main nihit hota he; sushupt, tandrit, swapnil avasthaa main asaadhaaran kalpit, akalpit, apratyaashit anubhutiyon ke rup main anayas aavegon dwaara maanas ke chitrapat par chadhataa utarataa rahata he
 Subjects or scenes that seem logically unrelated to logic are actually untargeted relationships that only Surrealism can illuminate
 atiyathartwaadiyon kii pratigya he ki hamaare saare kaaryon kaa udgam avchetan antar he
 He also gives speed and direction to our actions, and the emotions arising from that origin can be given visible, macro, juicy shapes
 atiyatharthwaad ke pratik or maan dainandin jivan ke parimaanon, pratibodhon se sarvatha bhinn hote hai
 Surrealists are interested in the expression of supernatural, wonderful, unimaginative and inconsistent situations
 aisa nahin ki us avchetan kaa sahitya athwa kala main astitv pehle na rahaa ho
 Fairy tales, fantasies of the paranormal, such as the stories of Alice in the Wonderland or Sindbad, depicting children or semi-depressed individuals present units of surrealism in both literature and art
 atiyathartwaadiyon kii sthapana he ki ham parthiv drishy jagat ko bhedakar, uske tathokt yatharth kaa atikaraman karke vaastavik param yatharth ke jagat main pravesh kar sakate hai
 Notation does not require representation of figures, it has to understand and explain the deeper elements of life, assess human responses to life, and these facts are undoubtedly beyond the visual world
 ankan ko manoranjan athwa anand kaa saadhan maananaa anuchit he
 The limitations of the gross eye and the vacancy of the eye were attested by Ghanvadi art itself, so it seemed necessary to interview the past indirectly, which is subconscious, unrealized surreal beyond rational reality
 is prakaar atiyatharthwaad maanas ke antaraal ko, avchetan ke tamaavisht gahawaron ko aalokit karata he
 Dadaism went a step ahead of Ghanism and Surrealism even further than Dadaism
 atiyatharthwaad kii jaden dadawad kii jameen main hi lagi hai
 Dadaism itself had left the land of functional imagination and worshiped the unconscious subconscious, now its later surrealism considered the subconscious and the visible world to be completely independent and separate
 maanviya chetanta or parthiv yatharth athwa kayik anubhuti main uske vichaar se koi sambandh nahin
 He made his goal of soul study, the discovery of the ultimate fact of life, and the identification of an inner subordinate scene
 unhone kaha ki saavyaveey sampoornataa ke bheetar sthultah lakshith hone vaale paraspar virdohi par vastutah anukool tathyon, jaise jivan or mrityu, bhoot or bhavishya, satya or kaalpanik ko ekatra karnaa hoga
 Surrealist declarator André Breton wrote: i believe that in the future, the two seemingly conflicting dreams and the conditions of truth will be synchronized to the ultimate reality, the surreal
 chithran kii pragati main atiyatharthwaad ne paramparaagat kalastyli ko tilanjali de di
 His assessment and intentions, the illustrations took a completely new turn, from the latter to the interchange
 avchetan kii swapnil sthitiyon, veikshiptavastha tak, ko usne shuddh pragna kaa svachhand rup mana
 Generally, two distinctions of surrealism are made: self-expression and impulse
 unamem pehali style kaa vishisht kalakaar salvador daali he or duusari kaa joan mero
 Both are from Spain
 avchetan ke upaask atiyatharthwaad ko phir bhi akalan ke kshetra main raag or rekha kii drushti se sarvatha uchhrunkhal bhi nahin samajhnaa chahie
 It is true that surrealism assesses the unpredictable in relation to the intended or imprinted subject, but as far as the technique of marking is concerned, its dimensions — the results — are always moderate, clear, and conniving
 daali ke chitra to is disha main dach chitrachaaryon kii kala se hode karte hai
 An example of unexpected reality can be given by a picture whose entire environment is of the hospital's surgery but on the operation table, where the patient can be expected to be, there is virtually painted sewing machine
 yaa nari kaa urdhvardh ankit karne vaale chitra main jahaan upar munh hone kii apeksha kii jaati he vahaan vastutah mej kii daraaj bani rahati he

 The detailed mechanism by which polar ozone holes differ from mid-latitude depletion, but the most important process in both trends is the decomposition of ozone by atomic chlorine and bromine
 The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is the light decomposition of chloro-fluoro-carbon compounds, these compounds are commonly called phreon, as well as the light decomposition of bromo-fluoro-carbon compounds called halons

 In the simplest example of such a cycle, a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule, taking one of its oxygen atoms to form clo and releasing one oxygen molecule
 chlorine monooxide ozon ke duusare anu ke saath kriya karke ek anya chlorine parmaanu or do oxigen anu bana detii he

 The stratospheric clouds make it more readily in the extreme cold of the Antarctic atmosphere

 As mentioned above, the overall cause of ozone depletion is the presence of chlorine-rich source gases
 In the presence of UV light, these gases decompose and release chlorine atoms, which cause ozone destruction

 Most of the destroyed ozone occurs in the lower stratosphere, in contrast to very little ozone depletion through homogeneous gas phase reactions, which occur initially in the upper stratosphere
 vasant ke ant ke paas garmi dene vaala taapmaana madhya disambar main bhavar ko tod detaa he
 When heated, ozone-rich air flows through lower latitudes, pscs are destroyed, the ozone depletion process stops, the ozone hole is filled
 haalaanki antarctic ozon hole kaa vaishvik ozon ko kam karne main bahut kam prabhaav hota he, yah prati dashak 4% hone kaa anumaan he, chhed ne bahut adhik ruchi paidaa kii he kyon ki: Since the ozone layer absorbs the sun's UVB, the ozone layer depletion can increase the level of surface UVB, causing damage, increasing the likelihood of skin cancer
 yah montrial protocol kaa kaaran tha
 Although ozone depletion of the stratosphere is related to CFC, there is sufficient reason to believe that ozone depletion will increase surface UVB, there is no direct evidence linking ozone depletion to increased skin cancer in humans

 Ozone, which is a minority component in the Earth's atmosphere, is responsible for most of the absorption of UVB radiation
 UVB vikiran kii maatra jo ozon parat main se hokar guzarati he, parat kii dhaalu path motaai / ghanatv ke saath ghaateey rup se kam ho jaati he
 a fact related to this is that the decrease in ozone in the atmosphere will be responsible for the significant increase in UVB levels near the surface

 The main public concern about the ozone hole is the effect of surface UV on human health
 In most places, so far, ozone depletion is only a few percent, with no direct evidence of health damage found in most latitudes
 ozon hole main ucch str kii kami duniya bhar main aam he, prabhaav adhik naatakeey ho sakate hai
 The ozone hole over Antarctica has become so large in some instances that it has reached the southern parts of Australia and New Zealand, according to environmentalists that the increase in surface UV may be significant

 The relationship between malignant melanoma and ultraviolet irradiation is not yet well known, but it appears that both UVB and UVA are involved
 Experiments on fish show that 90 to 95% of malignant melanomas are caused by UVA and visible radiation

 Pithos was mistranslated by Erasmus of the 16th century humanitarian Rotterdam who translated Pandora's Hesiod story into Latin

 The phrase "box of Pandora" has endured ever since

 This deletion is very important for the mother tongue of those languages to be understood and the tone of the speaker is right
 is shwa vilopan ke bina vaachak yaa to spasht gair-maatrubhaashi lagata he yaa phir use samajhane main hi kathinaayee ho sakati he
 Schwag deletions are a challenge for computer-readers and learners of languages because scripts in these languages often do not explain where to place and discard shwah
 aadhunik hindi ko likhane ke liye devanagari lipi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen aupchaarik rup se har vyanjan ke ant main agar halant na laga ho to 'a' ki dhwani jodi jaati he
 But for correct pronunciation of Hindi, the 'schwa elimination rule' of Hindi says that this shwa is often removed at the end of words and under certain circumstances
 ise kabhi-kabhi is prakaar se likhaa jaataa he: 'a -> ø | swar vyanjan _vyanjan swar'
 This means that according to the script, if a vowel is followed by a consonant followed by a vowel and is followed by a vowel that also has a vowel behind it, the middle vowel is discarded
 masalan 'ajgar' shabd ko dekha jaae to yah 'a+j+a+g+a+r+a' he lekin shabd ke ant vaala 'a' or 'a+j' or 'g+a' ke bich kaa 'a' donon hataa die jate hai, jis se 'ajgar' shabd kaa saadhaaran bolchaal main sahi hindi uccharan 'ajgar' he
 This is often evident in transliterating English
 'patna' shahar ko dekha jaae to lipi ke anusaar yah 'p+a+t+a+n+aa' he, jo angreji main 'patanā' likhaa jayega 
 But the Schwah deletion rule removes the middle Schwah, so in fact the correct pronunciation is 'p + a + t + n + aa', ie 'pat
nā'
 usee tarah 'uttar pradesh' ko agar aupchaarik lipi ke anusaar dekha jaae to yah 'uttara pradesha' hona chahie, lekin shwa vilopan kii vajah se yah 'uttar pradesh' ban jaataa he
 Note that due to the Schwah deletion, the pronunciation of certain syllable groups changes according to the situation in their word
 'saral' kaa uccharan 's+a+r+a+l' he jisamen ant kaa shwa villopit he
 But in 'sarla' the 'A' of the middle 'R' is removed as per rules, ie 'S + a + a + L'
 usee tarah 'paalak' or 'palki' main bich ke 'l' kaa shwa pehle to rakhaa jaataa he lekin dusre shabd se hataa diya jaataa he
 In the same way, the correct pronunciation of 'beats' in 'dil ki dhadkan' is 'dhadakne', ie the air of 'e' was removed
 lekin 'dil dhadkane laga' main 'dhadkane' kaa sahi uccharan 'dhadakne' he, yani is dafaa 'd' kaa shwa rakhaa gaya lekin 'k' kaa shwa hataaya gaya
 Mother tongues in Hindi pronounce these words comfortably without thinking, but this makes it difficult for non-female speakers and computers
