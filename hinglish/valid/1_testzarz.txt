 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 These protests were supposed to begin on 31 March 1960, but their rival pan-african Congress began its march on March 21, ten days before the anc's campaign, as they believed the ANC could not win in this campaign

 Police reports of 1960 claimed that inexperienced police officers suddenly opened fire in fear, which lasted for about forty seconds
 It is likely that police were terrified by a massacre that took place two months before the incident, in which nine police officers were killed in Cato Manor

 In practice, it is working like a faculty or short-term organization, which has strong links with governments
 
 The logo or symbol of this organization is American English and French in two official languages
 isamen ISO akshar bhi sammilit hai, jinase yah praayah janaa jaataa he, jo ki isaki sankshipti he
 Rather this abbreviation is derived from the Greek / Greek word ἴσος, which means equal
 yah maanate hue ki sanghathan kaa bhinn bhashaaon main bhinn sankshipti banegi, yah tay kiya ki ek sarvyaapee sarvamaanya naam ISO hi chalaaya jaae
 This in itself proves the purpose of this organization
 ISO ke mukhya utpaada hai anterrashtriya maanak
 Only published by ISO are: Technical Reports, Technical Specialization, Publicly Available Specialties, Technical Corrigendum, and and Guide
 anterrashtriya maanak kaa roopakar hota he ISO xxrep 5 n sheershak, jahaan xxrep 5 n he maanak sankhya, xxrep 4 y he prakaashan kaa varsh, evam sheershak bataata he vishay
 yadi maanak sanyukt takneekee samiti JTC1 ke kaary kaa parinaam he, to IEC bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 ASTM is also incorporated into standards developed in collaboration with ASTM International
 dinaak evam IS kaa prayog apurna yaa aprakashit maanakon ke liye aprayogneey he, evam kuch paristhitiyon main prakashit kaary kaa sheershak bhi chhona ja saktaa he

 For example takneekee vishesheekaran ko tab rachit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki "sambandhit vishay abhi bhi vikaas kii sthiti main hi he, yaa kisi anya karanvash bhavishya main kisi anterrashtriya maanak ko prakashit karne kii sahmati kii sambhaavna hoti he" 
 Publicly available specialties can be an "intermediate specialization that has been published prior to the development of the full international standard", or, a 'bicameral' publication in the IEC, published in collaboration with an external organization
 " Naming is done like a technical report
 udhaahrantah ISO sometimes also issues technical / technical corrigendum
 ye vartmaan maanakon ke sanshodhan hote hai, jo ki kshudra takneekee / paribhaashik trutiyon, prayogneeyata sudhaar yaa simit tareeke se prayojyata badhaane hetu kiye jate hai

 These are named in the "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : title", eg ISO pralekh prakashnadhikaar surakshit hote hai, evam ISO adhiktar kii pratiyon kaa mulya letaa he
 However, most of the values are taken only in electronic form

 ISO has three membership categories: bhagidaar sadsy "P" yaa pi sadsy kehalaate hai, jabaki anupaalan karne vaale "O" yaa o sadsy kehalaate hai
 The fact that many iso-created standards are universal, ubiquitous; On many occasions, the general use of "ISO" has been inspired to describe a product that conforms to the standards
 iske kai udhaaharan hai: To deal with the consequences of abundant coverage in the areas of standardization, and the tasks related to information technology; a Joint Technical Committee constituted from ISO & IEC or International Electrotechnical Commission known as ISO / IEC JTC1
 yah asi pratham samiti he, evam ajtak ek hi he
 Its official order is to develop, maintain, promote IT standards for business and user requirements in worldwide markets
 vartmaan main 18 up-samitiyaan hai :- Membership of ISO / IEC JTC1 is restricted to the same extent as that of its parent organizations
 ek sadsy yaa to bhagidaar yaa prekshak ho saktaa he
 The only difference between the proposed standards and other products is the ability to vote
 kisi sadsy sanstha ke liye kisi yaa prayek up-samiti par str / raay banaae rakhane kii, koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Occasionally, sub-committees may be formed, or even dissolved, to cope with new situations if their area of work is no longer in force
 ISO / TS jaise, antarrashtriya kaaryshaala samjhauta International Workshop Agreement bhi ISO kaa ek or shastraagaar he, jo ki un kshetron main, jahaan takneekee sanrachana evam nipunata abhi nahin pahaunchi he; vahaan maanakeekaran kii aavashyaktaaon par twarit pratikriya uplabdh karaata he

 Centrifuge, or mathra, is generally called a device or machine in which the separation of substances of different density is done by the use of centrifugal force
 aajkal apkendrit kii uparyukt paribhaasha adhik vistrut ho gai he, jiske anusaar aisi kisi bhi mashin ko, jisaki rachana is vishesh prayojan se kii gai ho ki usamen padaarthon ko kendrabhimukh, apkendri bal ke satat prabhaav main rakhaa ja sake, apkendritra kaha jaataa he
 The separation of substances in the centrifuge is due to different densities
 apkendran se apkendri bal utpann hota he, jo gurutvkarshan bal ke samaan hota he
 The centripetal force can be used to accelerate many processes that usually rely on relatively small forces of gravity
 bharat tathaa anya deshon main apkendritra kaa upyog bahut samay se hota aayaa he
 The process of churning out curd and milk depends on the centripetal force
 kendrabhimukh bal kii vaigyanik paribhaasha newton ke bal tathaa gati ke prasiddh niyam par aadhaarit he
 According to Newton's law, in free state, moving materials have the tendency to walk in a straight line
 at: yadi is prakaar ke gatisheel padaarth ko vakr path par chalane ke liye sanchalit kiya jaae, to vah padaarth us sanchalit, athwa niyantrit karanevaale padaarth, athwa vastu ke vipareet bal prayukt karata he
 As a result, the moving material has a constant tendency to move in the direction of the tangent of that curvature
 udaahranarth, yah saamaanya anubhav main dekha jaataa he ki vrutt path main paribhraman karanevaali koi vastu paribhraman centre se dur balpreyas karti he
 This direction of balancing is towards the tangent path of the revolving circle
 at: paribhraman ke koniya veg, vastu, athwa padaarth ke bhaar, athwa vastu ke paribhramanvrutt ke ardhavyas, main vruddhi hone se apkendri bal main vruddhi hoti he
 The rotation of the centrifugal force is inversely proportional to the radius of the circle and the weight of the object, while it is proportional to the square of the angular velocity
 apkendratri ke prati minute ghurnan kii sankhya main duguni vruddhi hone se apkendri bal main chauguni vruddhi hoti hai
 Similarly, a tenfold increase in the speed of the centrifuge leads to a hundredfold increase in the centrifugal force
 apkendran kii kriya main kisi vastu par kaary karne, athwa prabhaav utpann karne, vaale apkendri bal kii, bahudhaa vastu kii taul se sidhe tulana kii jaati he
 On this basis, the centrifugal force is expressed as a multiple of gravity
 gurutv ke liye g akshar ko pratik mana jaataa he, at: apkendri bal ko sankshep main g ke gunaj main likhaa jaataa he
 If an object in a centrifuge is rotating at a speed of 600 rotations per minute and the radius of the rotation is 3
84 inches or 10 cm, the centrifugal force generated in this situation is 41 times the gravity
 aadhunik evam vishesh prakaar ke apkendrit main gurutv kaa lakh guna apkendri bal utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 The modern centrifuge metal is a vessel in which the rotating part is connected to the stationary axis of the current
 at: vidyunmotor ke chalane par apkendritra kaa ghurnan karanevaala bhaag bhi vidyunmotor kii gati se ghurnit hone lagata he
 The speed of rotation is the same as the rotation of the axis of the axis
 purv samay main apkendrit main ghurnan haath se utpann kiya jaataa tha
 Even nowadays, manual labor is used to rotate the centrifuge in domestic use
 aadhunik ati teevr gati se ghurnit honevaale upakendritra main vidyunmotor ke sthaan par vaayu tarabine kaa upyog hone laga he
 The rotating part of the centrifuge is called a rotor
 iskaa aakaar katori ke samaan, athwa ulte pyaale ke samaan hota he
 In this, the liquid or other object is kept in a centrifuge tube, or directly in the bowl, for centrifuge
 apkendran kaary main apakedritra main anaavashyak evam hanikar kampan utpann na ho, iske liye aavashyak hota he ki vastu se purit roter purna rup se santulit ho
 For this, the entire weight of the object has to be distributed evenly around the rotating axle
 adarsh paristhiti main is vyavastha se mul balon kaa parinami shunya ke baraabar hota he
 Centrifuge tendency is of particular importance in liquids, especially of liquids which have suspended microscopic particles of solids or in which the immiscible liquids or both are present
 thos padaarth ke sookshm kan, jal tathaa tel se bane paayas se teenon vastuon kaa pruthakkaran saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 The force of gravity is very small compared to the centrifugal force produced in a centrifuge
 apkendri bal ke kshetra main, drav padaarth ghurnan aksh se adhik se adhik duuri par vipareet hone kaa praytn karata he, jisase drav apkendritra ke ghurnan paatr ke bahari kinaaren ke sameep samaan motaai main sthit ho jaataa he
 In this way, free space is spread uniformly from the axis to the fluid in the vessel, which is columnar
 is prakaar apkendran kii kriya ke dwaara nilambit karanevaale drav se apekshaakrit adhik ghanatvvaale, nilambit sookshmakan paribhraman paatr kii paridhi main ekatrit ho jate hai tathaa nilamban karanevaale drav se kam ghanatv ke nilambit sookshmakan paatr ke sthal par ekatrit ho jate hai
 How quickly the above separation will occur depends on the intensity of the centripetal force, the difference in density of the suspended fluid and suspended micro particles, the viscosity of the fluid, the size and magnitude of the suspended micro particles, and the concentration of the particles and the level of multiple electrical charges
 apkendritra ke anek audyogic upyog hai
 With this, not only the separation of various things, but also works like drying clothes are done
 apkendran bal ke upyog se pighali hui dhaatuon se vibhinn motaai ke pipon evam naliyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Centrifuge is used in sugar factories to remove water from sugar crystals
