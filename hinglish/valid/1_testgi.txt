 ek shairdharak ek vyakti yaa company he jo ek sanyukt stock company main ek yaa anek stock ke sheyaron kaa kanoonee taur par maalik he
 Both private and public business companies have shareholders
 share bazaar main soochibaddh companiyon se ummid kii jaati he ki ve shairdharak mulya main vruddhi ke liye prayaas karen
 Shareholders are given privileges based on class of stock, including matters such as election of board of directors, right to share in income distribution of the company, right to purchase new shares issued by the company, rights on assets of the company during liquidation of the company
 Includes the right to vote
 haalanki, company kii parisampattiyon par shairdharakon ke adhikaar, company ke lendaaron ke adhikaron se apradhan hai
 Shareholders are considered by some to be a partial subset of stakeholders, which may include anyone with an interest in direct or indirect equity in business power, or anyone with a non-profit interest in a nonprofit organization
 Thus it may be common for federal stakeholders to invoke voluntary contributors, even if they are not shareholders
 haalanki company ke nirdeshak or adhikari shairdharakon ke sarvottam hiton ke anukool kaam karne ke liye nyasiya kartavyon se baddh hai, saamanytah shairdharakon kii khud kii ek duusare ke prati aisi koi duty nahin he

 In a specific case, each share is equal to one vote
 lekin nigam, vibhinn varg ke share jari kar sakate hai, jiske matadhikaar alag ho sakate hai
 Ownership of most shares can defeat other shareholders in voting — effective control remains in the possession of majority shareholders
 is tarah aksar company ke mul maalikon ke paas phir bhi company kaa niyantran rahata he
 Although ownership of 50% of the shares does not result in 50% ownership of a company, it does not give the shareholder the right to use the building, equipment, materials, or other assets of the company
 aisa isliye he ki company ko ek kanoonee vyakti mana jaataa he, is prakaar vah apni sabhi parisampattiyon kaa maalik he
 This is important in areas such as insurance, which should be in the name of the company, not the main shareholder
 adhikansh deshon main, nideshak mandal or company ke prabandhakon kii nyasiya jimmedaari he ki apane stekadharakon ke hit main company chalaaen
 phir bhi, jaisaa ki martin whitemen likhte hai: Although the company is run by the board of directors, the shareholder has some influence on the company's policy, as the shareholders only elect the board of directors
 prayek shairdharak ke paas aam taur par uske swaamitv vaale sheyaron kii pratishtata ke baraabar mat pratishat hote hai
 So as long as the shareholders agree that the management's performance is poor, the new board of directors can choose who can hire the new management team
 vyavhaar main, haalanki, sahi myne main chunaav ladane vaale mandal durlabh hai
 Usually nominees of the board are named insiders or the board of directors themselves and a substantial amount of the stock is held and voted by insiders
 sheyaron ke swaamitv kaa matlab dendariyon kii jimmedaari nahin he
 If a company goes bankrupt and has defaulted on loans, shareholders are not responsible in any way

 Many jurisdictions have instituted laws and regulations governing such transfers, especially if the issuer is a public business entity
 stockdharakon dwaara apane share bechney kii ichha ke falswaroop share bazaar kii sthapana hui he
 The stock market is an organization that provides markets for the transaction of shares and other derivatives and financial products
 aajkal, stock brokar dwaara niveshak kaa pratinidhitiv kiya jaataa he, jo share bazaar main aam taur par vyapak companiyon ke share ko kharidte or bechate hai
 a company can list its shares in the stock market by meeting and following the listing requirements of the specific stock market
 sanyukt rajya america main, antar-bazaar uddhran pranali ke madhyam se, ek share bazaar main soochibaddh stock anya sahabhaagi share bazaaron main kharidi yaa bechi ja sakati he, jisamen archipelago yaa instinet jaise electronic communication network bhi shaamil hai
 Many large non-us companies choose to be listed on the US stock market in addition to their home equity markets, with a view to broadening their investor base
 in companiyon ke liye zaruri he ki ve america ke ek bank main sheyaron kaa ek khand banaae rakhen, jo aam taur par unki puunji kaa ek nishchit pratishat hota he
 On this basis, the bank holding the share capital establishes American Depository Shares and issues American Depository Receipts for each share acquired by the trader
 isi tarah, kai badi america companiyaan videsh main puunji jutaney ke liye, videshi share bazaaron main apane sheyaron ko soochibaddh karaati hai
 Small companies that are not eligible and do not meet the listing requirements of major stock markets may conduct counter-transactions through an off-exchange mechanism in which direct trading between the parties occurs
 sanyukt rajya main pramukh OTC bazaar hai electronic kotesan systams OTC bulatin board or pink OTC bazaar, jahaan vyaktigat khudara niveshkon kaa bhi pratinidhitiv brokerej farm dwaara hota he or soochibaddh kii jane vaali company ke liye uddhran seva apekshaayen bhi bahut kam hai
 Shares of companies with insolvency proceedings are generally listed by these quotation services, after being removed from the stock market from the stock market
 stock kharidne or vittaposhan ke vibhinn tareeke maujuud hai
 The most common solution is through a stockbroker
 Whether they are full service or discount brokers, they arrange for the transfer of stock from a seller to a buyer
 adhikansh vyapaar vastav main ek share bazaar main soochibaddh dallalon ke madhyam se kiya jaataa he
 There are many different stock brokers such as full service brokers or discount brokers for selection
 purna seva dalal aam taur par vyapaar ke prati adhik shulk vasuulate hai, lekin nivesh salaah yaa adhik vyaktigat seva dete hai; batta dalal nivesh sambandhi bahut kam salaah yaa koi salaah nahin dete hai, par vyapaar ke liye kam shulk lete hai
 Another type of broker can be a bank or credit union that has a full-service or discount broker deal set-up
 dalal ke madhyam se share kharidne ke alaava bhi anya tareeqe maujuud hai
 There is a means purchased directly from the company
 If at least one share is owned, most companies allow the purchase of shares directly from the company through their investor relations departments
 tathaapi, company ke stock kaa praarambhik share ek niyamit share dalal ke madhyam se praapt karnaa hoga
 company main stock kharidne kaa ek or tareeqa he pratyaksh saarvajanik vitaran prastaav, jo saamanytah company dwaara hi beche jate hai
 a direct public offering is an initial public distribution offer in which stock is purchased directly from the company, usually without the help of brokers
 jahaan tak stock kii kharidi ke vittaposhan kii baat he, do tareeqe maujuud hai: paise dekar stock kii kharidi jo samprati kharidaar ke swaamitv main he, yaa margin par stock kii kharidi dwaara
 margin par stock kii kharidi kaa matlab he usee khate main stock ke prati udhaar liye gaye paison se stock kii kharidi
 ye stock, yaa samparshvik yah guarantee dete hai ki kharidaar rin chukaa saktaa he; anyathaa, share dalal ko udhaar lee gai raashi kii chukauti ke liye stock ko bechney kaa adhikaar hota he
 If the share price falls below the expected margin, it can sell at least 50% of the value of the stock in the account
 margin par kareednaa usee tarah kaam karata he jaise car yaa ghar kharidne ke liye, samparshvik ke rup main car yaa ghar kaa istemaal karte hue paise udhaar lenaa
 iske alaava, rin nickshulk nahin he, dalal aam taur par 8-10% byaaj letaa he
 Selling shares is practically the same as buying shares
 saamanyatya, niveshak kam daam main khareednaa or adhik daam main bechnaa chahta he, yadi us kram main nahin ; haalanki ek niveshak ko haani uthaate hue bechney ke liye asankhya kaaran prerit kar sakate hai, udaa
 or adhik nuksaan se bachane ke liye
 Similar to the purchase of shares, the transaction fee is charged to the broker's efforts to arrange the transfer of stock from seller to buyer
 yah shulk dallali ke prakaar, purna seva yaa batta len-dein par nirbhar karte hue, zyaada yaa kam ho saktaa he
 After the transaction takes place, the seller is entitled to all the money
 vikray kaa mahatvapurn ansh he aay ke bare main khoj khabar rakhana
 mahatvapurn baat he ki jis adhikaar-kshetra main share beche jate hai, vahaan atirikt aagam raashi, yadi koi ho to, jo laagat aadhaar se zyaada hon, us par puunji laabh kar kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 The share price fluctuates due to the basic principle of demand and supply
 bazaar main sabhi vastuon kii tarah, share kii keemat maang ke prati samvedansheel he
 However, several factors influencing demand exist for a specific stock
 moulik vishleshan or takneekee vishleshan kaa kshetra mulya parivartan laane vaale bazaar paristhitiyon ko samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai, yaa bhavi mulya staron kaa purvanumaan lagaate hai
 a recent study shows that customer satisfaction, as measured by the American Customer Satisfaction Index, is particularly correlated with market value of the stock
 share kii keemat vishleshak dwaara company ke vyapaar purvanumaan or company ke saamaanya bazaar khand ke liye drushtikon se prabhavit ho sakati he
 At any given time, the value of an equity is actually the result of supply and demand
 aapurti kisi nishchit samay par bikri ke liye prastut sheyaron kii sankhya he
 Demand is the number of shares an investor wishes to buy at the same time
 share kii keemat santulan hasil karne or use banaae rakhane ke liye badalati rahati he
 When the number of prospective buyers exceeds the number of sellers, the price increases
 antat, ucch vikray mulya se aakarshith vikreta bazaar main pravesh karte hai or / yaa kharidaar baahar jate hai, jisase kharidaaron or vikritaon ke bich santulan hasil hota he
 When the number of sellers is less than the number of buyers, the price drops
 antat kharidaar pravesh karte hai or / yaa vikreta chale jate hai, dubaara santulan hasil hota he
 Thus, the value of a company's stock at a given time is determined by all investors voting with their own money
 agar adhik niveshak share chaahate hai or adhik bhugtan karne ko taiyaar hai, to keemat bad jaaegi
 yadi adhik niveshak share bech rahe hon or vahaan paryaapt kharidaar nahin hai, to mulya main giravat aegi
 Of course, this does not explain how people decide the maximum price at which they want to buy or the minimum price at which they are ready to sell
 vyavsaayik nivesh ke daayre main kushal bazaar pariklpana kii lokapriyata jari he, haalanki shaikshanik or vyavsaayik kshetron main is siddhant par vyapak rup se andeh prakat kiya gaya he
 In short, EMH states that investment as a whole is rational; That the share price at a given moment represents the rational valuation of known information, which may affect the future value of the company; And that the equity's stock price has been determined efficiently, which means that they are an accurate representation of the anticipated value of the stock as best known at the given time
 duusare shabdon main, keemten batta pratyaashit bhavi nakad pravaah kaa parinaam hai
 The EMH model, if true, has at least two interesting results
 pehla, kyonki vittiya jokhim kaa anumaan lagaaya jaataa he taaki pratyaashit mulya par kam se kam chota premium aavashyak ho, equity par laabh ke liye, gaiyr-equity niveshon se uplabdh laabh se kuch adhik pratyaasha kii ja sakati he: yadi nahin, to vahi tarksangat gananaa equity niveshkon ko apane in surakshit gaiyr-equity niveshon ko sthanantarit karne ke liye prerit karegi jinase kam jokhim par utana hi yaa usase behatar laabh kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 Second, because the stock price is an "efficient" reflection of the anticipated price at all times, then — relative to the curve of expected profit — the price will follow a random move, determined by the information that emerges over time
 Professional equity investors therefore immerse themselves in the flow of fundamental information, understanding the emerging information flow more wisely, to gain advantage over their competitors
 EMH model equity mulya nirdhaaran kii prakriya kaa purna vivaran detaa prathit nahin hota he
 For example, stock markets are more volatile than indicated by EMH
 haal ke varshon main yah sweekaar kiya gaya he ki share bazaar puri tarah sakasham nahin hai, shaayad khaskar ubharate bazaaron yaa anya bazaaron main jahaan acchhee tarah se vaakif peshewar niveshkon kaa prabhutv nahin he
 Another principle of share pricing comes from the field of behavioral finance
 vyavhaar vitt ke anusaar, manushya aksar tarkahin nirnay karte hai— khaskar, pratibhutiyon kii kharid or bikri se sambandhit—parinaamon ke bhay or galat samaj ke aadhaar par
 pratibhutiyon kaa tarkahin vyapaar aksar pratibhutiyon kii keemton ko taiyaar karata he, jo tarksangat, buniyadi qeemat moolyankanon se bhinn hote hai
 For example, during the technology bubble in the late 1990s, technology companies often bid beyond any rational value, in what is commonly known as the "great Fool Theory"
 "mahaan murkh siddhant" ke anusaar, equity main laabh kamaane kaa pramukh tareeqa anya niveshak ko bikri ke dwaara he, aise pratibhutiyon kaa chayan karnaa chahie jiske bare main yah vishwaas ho ki bhavishya main koi or unhen oonchi qeemat par ankega, bina is baat ke kisi aadhaar ke ki anya party oonchi qeemat dene kaa icchhuk he
 Thus, a rational investor also trusts the irrationality of another
 jab companiyaan ek se adhik share bazaar main stock kii peshkash dwaara puunji jutati he, vibhinn share bazaaron main sheyaron ke moolyankan main visangatiyon kii gunjaish rahati he
 a far-sighted investor with knowledge of such discrepancies will invest in anticipation of their possible convergence, known as arbitrage trading
 electronic trading ke parinamswaroop vyapak mulya paardarshita ubhari he or ye visangatiyaan, yadi ve maujuud hon to, alpakaalik hai or jald hi santulit ho jaati hai

 Even today, this slogan is used in the occasions, programs and movements related to the national love or nation building

 The book has a table of contents in 10 pages alone - which contains chapters like 'aamukh Vithi / Chatushpadi Chatvara, mangal-chatvara, Nagaraveethi, Rajavithi, Utsavavithi, Citizenvithi, Gardenavithi, Abhinandanavithi and Vrajakavitavithi

 kavishiromani bhatta mathuranath shastri Baruth de Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Jewish descent
 unka parivartit naam 'benedict di spinoja' tha
 He showed remarkable scientific aptitude, but the importance of his works could be realized only after his death
 spinoja kaa janm holland main, yahudee parivaar main, san 1632 main hua tha
 He was reclusive, fearless and uninterested by nature
 apane vishwaason ko tyaagane ke liye unako lobh dikhaaya gaya, unki hatya kaa shadyantr rachaa gaya, unhen yahudee sampradaay se bahishkrut kiya gaya, phir bhi ve adig rahe
 Worldly life seemed to him like an intolerable disease
 at: usase mukti paane tathaa ishwarprapti ke liye ve baichaiyn rahete the
 Spinoza's most famous treatise is his 'ethics'
 kintu iske atirikt bhi unhone saat yaa aath granthon kaa pranayan kiya he
 Principles of Philosophy and Metaphysical Cogitations were published in 1663 and Tractatus Theologico Polyticus in 1670, without his name
 unke teen adhure granthtrectatus polyticas, trectatus di intelectus emagedateon, gramatices lingue hebrasi hai - jo unke mukhya granth athiks ke saath, unki mrityu ke uparaant usee saal 1677 main prakashit hue
 Many days later, another treatise, Tractetus Brevis de Dio, was published in 1858
 spinoja ke jivan tathaa darshan ke vishay main anek granth likhe gaye hai jinaki suchi spinoja in da lite ov vedant main di gai he
 The idea that matter can be a creation of matter, so ideology and expansion are matter, Spinoza protested
 dravya, swayamprakash or swatantra he, uski sristi nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, ideology and expansion, which are created, are not titles but degrees
 spinoja anishvaravaadi is arth main kahe ja sakate hai ki unhone yahudee dharm tathaa isai dharm main prachlit ishwar kii kalpana kaa virodh kiya
 Spinoza's substance or God is nirguna, formless and personless omnipresent
 kisi bhi prakaar ishwar ko vishisht rup dena usko simit karnaa he
 In this sense the God of Spinoza is similar to the Brahman of Advaita Vedanta
 jis prakaar brahm kii do oopaadhiyaan, naam or rup hai, usee prakaar spinoja ke dravya kii do oopaadhiyaan vichaar or vistaar hai
 These are not properties of matter
 brahm ke swaroopalakshan ke samaan dravya ke bhi gun hai jo uske swaroop se hi siddh ho jate hai, jaise uski adwitiyata, swatantraaa, purnataa aadi
 It is more aforementioned to call thought and extension not a virtue, because according to Spinoza they are charged by the intellect to understand the nature of matter
 is prakaar kii anant oopaadhiyaan spinoja ko maanya hai
 These titles of God are also infinite, but the infinitude of God is absolute and the infinity of these titles is relative
 ishwar jagat kaa srashta he, parantu is rup main nahin ki vah apni ichhashakti se sampurna vishwa kii rachana karata he
 To really impose a will in God is to limit it
 parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki ishwar swatantra nahin he; uski swatantraaa uski sarvanirpekshata he na ki swantatra ichha isi se spinoja sristi ko saprayojan nahin maanata
 The reason for the god world is in the same sense as the golden ornament or the sky triangle
 parantu iskaa yah arth nahin ki ishwar parivartansheel he
 The world is fictitious, but its basis is true God
 ishwar or jagat vibhinn hai, parantu vibhakt nahin
 Just as God does not have the willpower, in the same way there is no thing called free will in man
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki prayek vichaar kaa kaaran ek anya vichaar hua karata he at: koi bhi vichaar swatantra nahin he
 Also, the physical world is not affected by Spinoza's thinking
 kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa alag hai parantu donon ek hi dravya, he at: ve sambandhit maaloom padate hai
 In practice, Spinoza seems deterministic
 unka kahana he ki ichhashakti ke asweekaar karne se hamaare vyavhaar tathaa aachaar par prabhaav nahin padataa at: usase sarshak hona anaavashyak he
 The reality is that if we are determined that the work-cause-chain of the world is independent, then we will have great peace
 manushya tabhi tak ashaant rahata he jab tak uskosh kaary kaaran-shrunkhlaa main parivartan kii aashaa rahati he
 Belief in free will is our bond
 ichaswatantray kaa upyog ichaswatantray ke niraakaran ke liye karnaa chahie
 With the suppression of the will of the independent, the princely instinct and mental disorders are quenched and the mind is capable of divination
 jivan kaa param lakshya ishwar kii prapti he kyoki tabhi nityashubh kii prapti ho sakati he
 The attainment of God comes from loving God, but love does not mean sentimentality but emotionality
 isi se spinoja ne is prem ko bauddhik prem kaha he
 One meaning of divinity is that we do virtue for virtue, because wishing for reward in virtue of virtue is the creation of a bond
 jab hamaara man ishwarmay tathaa hamaara drushtikon nity kaa drushtikon ho jaataa he tab ham ishwar ke saath tadatmya kaa anubhav karte hai tathaa param shanti praapt karte hai
 In Spinoza's view, the virtuous form of God is also important
 jinka bauddhik str nicha he tathaa jinke man main sagun, saakaar ishwar kii kalpana se dharmbhaavna jaagrath hoti he unke liye yah kalpana atyant upyogi he
 It is better to believe in God than to realize God more than not to believe in God
 spinoja kaa vichaar sarvadharmanirpeksh tha, isi se aaj ke yug main logon kii drushti spinoja kii ore baar baar ja rahi he

 Both Superman and Batman then confront him

 But Superman dies in this affair

 The Vedic period reaches its zenith only after the creation of the Mantra texts, with the establishment of various branches throughout northern India, which discuss their meaning to the mantra codes with the meanings of Brahman, and the age of Buddha and Panini The rise of Mahajanapadas reaches its end in

 vaidic kaal main granthon kaa sancharan maukhik parampara dwaara kiya gaya tha, vistrut naimanik takneekon kii sahaayta se parishuddhta se sangrakshit kiya gaya tha
 The literary tradition can be traced back to the Vedic times following the rise of Buddhism in the Mauryan period, perhaps the earliest in the Kanva text of the Yajurveda of the 1st century BCE; However the oral tradition of transmission remained active
 vizel ne 1 sahastrabdi bisii ke ant main likhit vaidic granthon kii sambhaavna kaa suzav diya
 Some scholars such as Jack Goody state that "the Vedas are not the products of an oral society", basing this approach by comparing the discrepancies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as Greek, Serbia and other cultures
 Focusing on, Vedic literature is very coherent and vast which was composed orally over generations, without being written
 haalanki, gaudi kehete hai, vaidic granthon kii ek likhit or maukhik parampara donon main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he, ise "sakshartaa samaaj ke samanaantar utpaadon" kehete hai
 Due to the ephemeral nature of manuscript material, surviving manuscripts rarely cross the age of a few hundred years

 Historically Brahma, his sons Badarayana and grandson Vyasa and others such as Jaimini, Patanjali, Manu, Vatsyayan, Kapil, Kanad etc
 had good knowledge of the Vedas

 Mahidhar and Uvvat were commentators of this category
 aadhunik kaal main raja rammohan raay kaa brahm samaaj or dayanand saraswati kaa arya samaaj lagbhag ek hi samay main vedon ke sabase bade prachaarak bane
 In addition to this, Shankar Pandurang published Atharvaveda in four volumes besides Sayan Bhashya

 After this, Shriram Sharma Acharya of Gayatri Tapobhoomi has also published the commentaries of the Vedas - his commentaries are scripted
 satrahavin sadi main mogul badshaah aurangzeb ke bhai daara shukoh ne kuch upanishdon kaa farsi main anuwaad kiya jo pehle francisi or baad main anya bhashaaon main anudit huin
 In Europe, it was followed by Vedic and Sanskrit literature
 maiks mular jaise europea vidwaan ne bhi sanskrit or vaidic sahitya par bahut adhyayan kiya he
 But the attention of the scholars of Europe is focused on making and proving the theory of the Hindu Aryan language family
 shabdon kii samanta ko lekar bane is siddhant main aitihaasik tathy or kaal nirdhaaran ko tod-marod karnaa hi padataa he
 For this reason, the time of creation of Vedas is considered to be 1800-1000 BC which does not meet Sanskrit literature and Hindu principles

 The incarnation period of the Vedas is considered to be the beginning of the present creation
 iske hisaab se veda ko avatarit hue 2017 ko 1,97,29,49,118 varsh honge
 The Vedas remained as Shruti after the incarnation and much later the Vedas were scripted and Vedangas were invented from the Vedas to preserve or better understand the Vedas
 isamen upasthit khagoleey vivarnanusaar kai itihaaskaar ise 5000, 7000 saal purana maanate hai parantu aatmachintan se gyaat hota he ki jaise saat din biit jane par punah ravivaar aata he vaise hi ye khagoleey ghatnaayen baar baar hotin hai atah inke aadhaar par gananaa shreyaskar nahin
 Some of the real Vedas, which were the repository of knowledge, were destroyed in the Mughal Empire and some during the British
 veda hame brahmad ke anokhe, aalokik va anant raaj bataate he jo samay va samaj se pare he
 The ancient policies and knowledge of the Vedas not only explain this world, but they can also prove to be helpful in running this world again in a smooth manner
 pracheen kaal se bharat main vedon ke adhyayan or vyakhya kii parampara rahi he
 According to the Vedic Sanatan Varnashrama religion, sages and sages, from Brahma to Veda Vyasatatha Jaimini in Ahasuyuga, have considered these as words, evidence and have also built their texts based on them
 parashar, katyayan, yajyavlky, vyas, panini aadi ko pracheen kaal ke vedavetta kehete hai
 There is a tradition of interpreting the Vedas after the knowledge of the four sages
 atah falswaroop ek hi vedaka swarup bhi mantra,brahman, aaranyak, upanishad ke rupmen chaar hi mana gaya he
 Historical Puranas etc
 were composed in the form of lectures of great texts Vedas

 The main topic - with words like Dev, Agni, Rudra, Vishnu, Marut, Saraswati etc
 vedavetta maharishi swami dayanand saraswati ke vichaar main gyaan, karm, upasna or vigyaan vedon ke vishay hai
 Knowledge of the individual nature of these three eternal entities is available only through Vedas

 According to Hinduism, Maharishi Manu, the oldest lawmaker, said that Vedokhilo Dharmamoolam - Veda is the basic basis of religion and theology in the form of Khmerless Vedas i

 Sampradaya Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads

 According to them, the word Devta means - giving things, learned people and Sukta mantras, not idol-worshiping adorable forms

 It was nothing but a thought-provoking conspiracy

 Those Anglo translators used to say, "aryans are foreigners
 wo bharat aae or unhone yahan rahane vaale logon ko maaraa, taadit kiya tathaa yahan shashan kiya
 The Indians worshiped the penis, and were called dasyu or demons
 " parantu usee kalkhand ke itihaaskaaron ne yah sabit kar diya ki yah keval myth hi he or isamen ratti bhar bhi sachai nahin he or hadappa mohanjo dado ke purvaj bhi arya hi the
 The evidence of Mohenjo-daro being Vedic was known from the currencies obtained in mining, one of which is described below

 When asked, he said that whatever he wrote, he wrote it after studying the Vedic translation of the British

 The Indian government and people are still lying in such stupidity, a proof of this is a version of Muslim India which was printed on 27 March 1985
 bhartiya vidyalayon main yahi bataaya, padhaayaa jaataa rahaa; isise bharat kaa bhavishya gyaat ho jaataa he
 India is infected with this insane ideology even after independence, the direct evidence of this was the low point of Mr
 Frank Anthony, which he put before the Parliament on 4 September 1977
 vaidicon kaa yah sarvasvagranth 'vedatrayee' ke naam se bhi vidit he
 Earlier this Veda Granth was the same name as Yajurveda - Ekavasiidyajurveda Chaturdha: Personally again, the same Yajurveda became famous as rik-yajusva-samas, from which it was called 'trilogy'
 Later it became very difficult to read Veda, so three or four divisions of the same Veda were done
 tab unako rigyajusamke rupame vedatrayee athwa bahut samay baad rigyajusamatharv ke rup main chaturveda kahalaane lage
 Mantras were categorized on the basis of type and meaning
 iskaa aadhaar is prakaar he - The Vedic tradition is of two types - the Brahma tradition and the Aditya tradition
 dono parampara ke vedatrayee parampara pracheen kaal me prasiddh tha
 There are three styles of word usage in the world: poetry, prose and anthem
 vedon ke mantron ke 'padya, gadhy or gaan' aise teen vibhaag hote hai - There are definite rules of letter-number and foot and punctuation in the verse
 atah nishchit akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam vaale veda-mantron kii sangya 'rik' he
 Mantras, which do not have the letter number and foot and punctuation according to the rules of the verse, are called 'yajuha' and all the chants are lyrical, they are called 'sama'
 in teen prakaar kii shabd-prakaashan-shaileyon ke aadhaar par hi shaastra evam lok main veda ke liye ‘trayee’ shabd kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The Yajurveda is a prose collection, so the verses of the Rigveda in this Yajurveda are recited as prose at the time of reading the Yajurveda
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke purv vedon ke ukt chaar vibhaag alag-alag nahin the
 At that time, Rik, Yajuh and Sama - in these three word-styles, a specific study of the collective word-amount was called Veda
 peeche jaakar veda ke samakaksh me atharv bhi salagn ho gaya, phir 'trayee' ke jagah 'chaturveda' kahalaane lage | guru ke rusht hone par jinhone sabhi vedon ko aditya se praapt kiya he un yajyavlky ne apni smriti me vedatrayee ke baad or puranon ke aage atharv ko sammilit kar bolaa vedanstharvpuranani iti 
 The present-day Vedas are four - but earlier they were the same
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar maane jate hai
 But these four together were considered to be a single 'veda Granth'
 lakshantah trayee hote huye bhi veda ek hi tha, phir usko charbhagame baanta gaya
 Due to the spread of hearing and memorization from generation to generation, the creator Brahmaji also has Shruti, Amnaya due to self-proof, Amauya due to self-attestation, and Apoorusheya, etc
, due to attaining the form of Aaurusheya Vani
 veda ke pathan-pathan ke kram main gurumukh se shravan evam yaad karne kaa veda ke sangrakshan evam safalataa kii drushti se atyant mahatva he
 For this reason Veda is also called "shruti"
 veda parishrampurvak abhyaas dwaara sangrakshniya he, is kaaran iskaa naam ‘'amnaay’' bhi he
 The Maharshiyans have created the Ashta deformity in the defense of Vedas - Jata Mala Shikha Rekha Dhwajo Dando Ratho Ghanah | Ashtau Deformity: Procto permutative Maharsay: || As a result of which, like ancient times, even today, there is chanting in the form of lust, long, stilted and sublime, unspoken vocal
 iske anusaar prayek shakha kii vaidic shabd-raashi kaa vargeekaran- upar varnit prayek veda ke chaar bhaag hote hai
 Apart from the first part of the mantra, the other three parts are not considered as Vedas, but such an idea has not been proved to be logical
 anadi vaidic parampara main mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad ek hi vedake chaar avyav he
 Overall the parts of the Vedas are: - upar ke chaaron khand veda hone par bhi kuch log keval 'samhita' ko hi veda maanate hai
 At the end of Dwaparyug, Shri Krishna Dvapayan Ved Vyasa ji had four divisions of that Veda keeping in view the use of Yagyushthan and taught these four divisions to four disciples
 ye hi chaar vibhaag rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ke naam se prasiddh he
 The four disciples named Pal, Vaishampayan, Jaimini and Sumantu taught the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda respectively
 in chaar shishyon ne shakal aadi apane bhinn-bhinn shishyon ko padhaayaa
 Due to the propagation and preservation of the Vedas by these disciples under their own, they will be greatly expanded through the Vedic texts, Charan, Branch, Pratiksha and Anushaka
 The same preachers are famous by the name of sages
 purvokt chaar shishyone shurume jitne shishyonko anushravan karaayaa ve charansamuh kahalaaye | prayek charansamuhame bahutse shakha hote he
 And in this way Pratishakha, Anushakha etc
 became
 veda kii anek shakhaaen yani vyaakhyaan kaa tarika bataayi gayi hai
 According to the sage Patanjali's Mahabhashya, 21 of the Rigveda, 101 of Yajurveda, 1001 of Samaveda, 9 of Arthaveda have 1131 such branches, but today only 12 branches are available in the original texts
 veda kii prayek shakha kii vaidic shabdarashi chaar bhaagon main uplabdh he: 1
 samhita 2
 brahman 3
 aaranyak 4
 upanishad
 Some people consider the Samhita as Vedas
 shesh teen bhaag ko vedon ke vyakhya granth maanate hai
 In different branches, the original codes remain the same but there is a difference between the Aranyak and Brahmin texts
 kai mantra bhaag main bhi upanishad miltaa he jaisaa ki shuklayajurveda mantrabhagamen isavasyopanishad| puraane samay main jitani shakhaaen thi utani hi mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad hote the |itani shakhaon ke babajud bhi aajkal kul 9 shakhaon ke hi granth milte hai
 In other branches, some mantras, some Brahmins, some Aranyakas and some Upanishads are found
 itane hi nahi adhik shakhaonke to upanishad hi paaya jaataa he ,tabhi to upanishad adhik milte hai
 The Vedic sages found the Vedas to be popular in public welfare
 nihsandeh jaisaa ki -:yathema vaachan kalyanimavadani janebhyah vaisaa hi veda hi yagnarthambhipravrita kalanupoorvyabhihitashch yagyah tasmadidan kalvidhanshastran yo jyotishan veda sa veda yagyam vedon kii pravritih janakalyan ke kaary me he
 The word Veda is formed by applying the suffix h to vid dhatu
 sanskrit grathon main vid gyane or vid laabhe jaise visheshnon se vid dhaatu se gyaan or laabh ke arth kaa bodh hota he
 The subjects of Vedas depend on their interpretation - topics like Agni, Yajna, Surya, Indra, Soma, Brahma, mana-atma, Jagatna, the qualities of substances, religion, couplets, meditation-yoga, Pran recurrently
 yajna main devtaa, dravya, uddeshy,or vidhi aadi viniyukt hote hai
 According to the texts, their description is as follows - rugveda ko chaaron vedon main sabase pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is divided in two ways
 pratham prakaar main ise 10 mandalon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Circles contain some hymns in Suktas, Suktas
 kul richaayen 10520 hai
 The Rigveda has 64 chapters in another way
 aath-aath adhyyon ko milakar ek ashtak banaaya gaya he
 There are eight such octaves in total
 phir prayek adhyay ko virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The number of classes is different in different chapters
 kul varg sankhya 2024 he
 Each class has some mantras
 sristi ke anek rahasyon kaa inamen udghaatan kiya gaya he
 Earlier it had 21 branches, but at present its branch branch is being promoted
 isamen gadhy or padya donon hi hai
 Yajna is the priority of karma
 pracheen kaal main isaki 101 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main keval paanch shakhaaen hai - kathak, kapishthal, maitrayani, taittiriya, vaajasaneyi
 This Veda has two distinctions - Krishna Yajurveda and Shukla Yajurveda
 krishna yajurveda kaa sankalan maharishi veda vyas ne kiya he
 Its other name is also Taittiriya Samhita
 isamen mantra or brahman bhaag mishrit hai
 Shukla Yajurveda - It was given by Surya as a sermon to Yajnavalkya
 isamen 15 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main madhyandin ko jise vaajasaneyi bhi kehete hai praapt hai
 It has 40 chapters, 303 anuvakas and 1975 mantras
 antim chalisvaan adhyay eshavasyopanishad he
 This is the lyrical book
 isamen gaan vidya kaa bhandar he, yah bhartiya sangeet kaa mul he
 The singing of the hymns is called Sama
 isaki 1001 shakhaaen thim
 But nowadays only three are prevalent - Kothumiya, Jaiminiya and Ranayaniya
 isko purvarchik or uttararchik main baanta gaya he
 There are four scandals in the predecessor - igneous scandal, andra scandal, Powman scandal and Aranya scandal
 chaaron kandon main kul 640 mantra hai
 Then there are 10 mantras of Mahanamanyarchik
 is prakaar purvarchik main kul 650 mantra hai
 There are six readers
 uttararchik ko 21 adhyyon main baanta gaya
 There are nine readers
 isamen kul 1225 mantra hai
 Thus the Samaveda has a total of 1875 mantras
 isamen adhiktar mantra rugveda se liye gaye hai
 It can also be called the originator of worship
 isamen ganit, vigyaan, ayurveda, samaaj shaastra, krishi vigyaan, aadi anek vishay varnit hai
 Some people also find mantra-tantra in it
 yah veda jahaan brahm gyaan kaa upadesh karata he, vahiin moksh kaa upaay bhi bataata he
 It is also called Brahma Veda
 isamen mukhya rup main atharvan or angiras rishiyon ke mantra hone ke kaaran atharv angiras bhi kehete hai
 It is divided into 20 kandas
 prayek kand main kai-kai sutara hai or sutron main mantra hai
 There are a total of 5977 mantras in this Veda
 isaki aajkal do shakhaaen shounik evam pippalad hi uplabdh hai
 The scholar of the Atharvaveda is the author of the four Vedas
 yajna main rugveda kaa hota devon kaa aahnan karata he, samaveda kaa udgaata samgaan karata he, yajurveda kaa adhvaryu dev:kotikarm kaa vitan karata he tathaa atharvaveda kaa brahm puure yajna karm par niyantran rakhata he
 Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharva Veda and Sthapatya Veda - These have been told by the Upveda Katyayana of the four Vedas respectively
 vedon ke sarvangin anushilan ke liye shiksha, kalp, vyakaran, nirukt, chand or jyotish ke granth hai jinhen 6 ang kehete hai
 Pratipadasutra, Anupada, Chandobhasha, Dharmashastra, Justice and Vaiseshika - These 6 views are also available
 upangon ke vishay is prakaar hai - In the Veda samhita, there are signs of chanting their high, medium, or slow musical vowels by placing standing and horizontal lines in the mantras
 inako udaatt, anudaatt fir swaarit ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya he
 These vowels have been in vogue since ancient times and Mahamuni Patanjali has included his main cardinal rules in his great language
 swaron ko adhik yaa nune rup se bole jane ke kaaran inke bhi do-do bhed ho jate hai
 Such as udatta-udattar, anuadatta-anudattar, swarika-swarittodatta
 inke alaave ek or swar mana gaya he - shruti - isamen teenon swaron kaa milan ho jaataa he
 Thus the total number of vowels becomes 7
 in saat swaron main bhi aapas main milane se swaron main bhed ho jaataa he jiske liye swar chihnon main kuch parivartan ho jaataa he
 Although many methods are used in the marking and typing of these vowels and there is not a single mode common in publisher-commentators, in most places a horizontal line below the letter for the approved and a vertical line above the letter for the vocal
 Is the rule
 udaatt kaa apana koi chihn nahin he
 Due to this problem in marking, many writer-publishers do not use vowel signs at all
 vaidic mantron main prayukt chand kai prakaar ke hai jinamein mukhya hai- According to this, the ritual of Vedokta Yajna is considered to be the main use of the words of Veda
 sristi ke armbh se hi yajna karne main saadharantaya mantroccharan kii style, mantrakshar evam karm-vidhi main vividhta rahi he
 It is due to this diversity that the branches of the Vedas have expanded
 yatha-rugveda kii 21 shakha, yajurveda kii 101 shakha, samaveda kii 1000 shakha or atharvaveda kii 9 shakha- is prakaar kul 1,131 shakhaayen hai
 This number is also mentioned by Maharishi Patanjali in his great language
 uparyukt 1,131 shakhaon main se vartmaan main keval 12 shakhaayen hi mul granthon main uplabdh haih- Out of the above 12 branches, only 6 branches have the learning style - Shakal, Taittariya, Madhyandini, Karma, Kauthum and Shaunak Shakha
 yah kahana bhi anupyukt nahin hoga ki anya shakhaon ke kuch or bhi granth uplabdh hai, kintu unase shakha kaa puraa parichay nahin mil saktaa evam bahut-si shakhaon ke to naam bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 As mentioned above, understanding of many words of Vedas has not been as simple
 vedunkaa vaastavik arth samajhane ke liye inke bhitarase hi vedangunka avishkaar kiya gaya | isaki vajah inamen varnit arthon ko janaa nahi ja saktaa | sabase adhik vivaad-vaarta ishwar ke swaroop, yani ekmaatr yaa anek devon ke sadrishy ko lekar hua he
 The real meaning of Vedoun can be done only by those who know the education - Kalpa, Grammar, Nirukta, Chanda and Astrology
 europe ke sanskrit vidwaanon kii vyakhya bhi hind-arya jati ke siddhant se prerit rahi he
 In the ancient times itself, many such opinions appeared, challenging their power, which are still called religious views but are different in many ways
 inkaa mukhya antar neeche spasht kiya gaya he
 Among them, who are guided by the Vedas, shakhas, and Kalpasutra, who believe in a unique universe, believe in the Vedas by not engaging in any one god, they believe in the Vedic Sanatana Varnashrama religion, they consider Vedon as Sarvopari
 iske alaava alag alag vichaar rakhanevaale or pruthak pruthak devtaa maanane vaale kuch sampradaay ye hai-: The topics which have been disputed are given below
 yajna:yajna ke vartmaan rup ke mahatv ko lekar kai vidwaanon, maton or bhashkaron main virodhabhash he
 The use of fire in the yajna has been so much similar to the ancient Parsi worship method and scholars have been interested in the immense importance of havan
 devtaa:dev shabd kaa lekar hi kai vidwaanon main asahmati rahi he
 The Vedokta Nirguna - formless and saguna - in many faiths who believe in the last aspect of the form, consider it to be a great person with special powers as a great man and worship them in idol, while many others call them the names of God
 paroapkaar karne vaali vastuen, vidwaan log or maargdarshan karne vaale mantron ko dev kaha gaya he
 For example, by not understanding the meaning of the word fire, first of all, that is to say, God
 devtaa shavd kaa arth divya, yani parameshwar kii shakti se purna mana jaataa he - jaise prithvi aadi
 Mahadev, in this view, calls God because he is the Lord of the Gods
 isi tarah sarvatra vyapak ishwar vishnu or satya hone ke kaaran brahma kehalaata he
 In this way, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev are not names of any character but names of God
 vyakaran or niruktake valpar hi vaidic or loukik shabdonke arth nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of this, they sit in the waste of meaning
 isi praakar ganesh, prajapati, devi, buddha, lakshmi ityadi parameshwar ke hi naam hai
 The Vedadi scriptures belong to the same God
 jaisaa kii upanishadonme kaha gaya he- eko dev sarvbhooteshu guiah sarvyaapee sarvabhootantaraatma | kuch log ishwarke sagun- nirgun swarupame jhagadte rahete he
 Some of them do idolatry and there are people who are against idolatry and consider God as the only truth, paramount
 ashwamedh:ashwamedh se hinsa or bali kaa vichaar aata he
 This is surprising to many Hindus as purists have been avoiding violence in many places
 kaiyon kaa maananaa he ki medh shabd main adhwaran kaa bhi prayog hua he jiskaa arth he ahimsa
 Therefore, there must have been some other meaning of merit
 isi prakaar ashv shabd kaa arth ghoda na rahakar shakti rahaa hoga
 According to Shri Ram Sharma Acharya languages, the word Ashwa means power, the word Gau means nutrition
 isse ashwamedh kaa arth ghode kaa bali se itar hoti prathit hoti he
 Som: Some people consider it to be wine, but according to many translations it was made by code-grinding
 atah ye sharaab jaisaa koi peya nahin lagata
 But its true form has not been determined

 One frequently used classification is the division into relief-oriented as opposed to development-oriented organizations; They may also be divided according to whether they put more emphasis on service delivery or participation, or whether they are religious or secular and they are more public or private oriented

 shabd "naagarik samaaj sanghathan" kaa prayog ek badhati sankhya ke sanghathanon jaise vaishvik shashan ke adhyayan ke liye centre, dwaara kiya gaya he
 The term "civic sector organization" has also been advocated to describe the region - of citizens, as one for citizens
 It gives the region its nickname and location as its own entity, without relying on the language used for government or business sectors
 haalanki kuch ne kaha he ki yah visheshat: sahaayak nahin he, kyunki zyaadaatar gaiyr sarkari sanghathan vastutah sarkaron or vyapaar ke dwaara nidhibaddh hai or kuch gaiyr sarkari sanghathan spashtatya swatantra rup se yojit logon ke sanghathanon ke virdohi hai

 Daksha Prajapati had two daughters in the Satyuga - Kadru and Vinata
 un donon kaa vivaah maharishi kashyap ke saath hua
 Once pleased, Kashyap asked both of them to ask for the desired groom
 kadru ne samaan parakramee ek sahastra naag-putr maange tathaa vinata ne uske putron se adhik tejasvi do putr maange
 Later, both received one thousand and two eggs respectively
 500 varsh baad kadru ke andon ke naag prakat hue
 Vinata jealously broke one of her eggs on her own
 usamen se ek aviksit balak niklaa jiskaa urdhvabhag ban chukaa tha, adhobhaag kaa vikaas nahin hua thaan usne cruddh hokar maa ko 500 varsh tak kadru kii daasi rahane kaa shaap diya tathaa kaha ki yadi doosraa anda samay se purv nahin phoda to vah purnaviksit balak maa ko daasitv se mukt karegaa
 The first child became Arun and became the charioteer of the sun in the sky and the second child became Garuda and flew into the sky
 vinata tathaa kadru ek baar kahin baahar ghoomane gayin
 Seeing a horse named Uchhashrava there, they both got the condition that anyone who misrepresented her color would become the maid of the other
 agle din ghode kaa rang dekhne kii baat rahi
 Vinata had described his color as white and Kadru had described his color as white, but the tail as black
 kadru ke man main kapat tha
 On his way home, he ordered his sons to wear black hair on his tail so that he would emerge victorious
 jin sarpon ne uskaa aadesh nahin mana, unhen usne shaap diya ki ve janamejay ke yajna main bhasma ho jaayen
 While approving this curse, Brahma called Kashyapa and said - 'the number of snakes you have produced has increased a lot
 tumhaari patni ne unhen shaap dekar acha hi kiya, at: tum usase rusht mat hona
 By saying this, Brahma gave Kashyapa the knowledge to remove the poison of snakes
 vinata tathaa kadru jab ucchashrava ko dekhne agle din gayin tab uski poonch kaale naagon se dhaki rahane ke kaaran kaali jaan pad rahi thi
 Vinata was very sad and took the place of Kadru's maid
 garud ne sarpon se poocha ki koun-sa aisa kaary he jisko karne se uski mata ko daasitv se chhutkaaraa mil jaayegaa? uske naag bhaaiyon ne amrit laakar dene ke liye kaha
 Garuda departs in search of nectar
 usko samast devataaon se yuddh karnaa padaa
 Being the most powerful, Garuda defeated everyone
 tadnantar ve amrit ke paas pahunchaa
 Taking a very subtle form, he crossed the cycle running continuously near Amritghat
 vahaan do sarp paharaa de rahe the
 After killing both of them, he picked up Amritghat and took it away
 usne swayan amrit kaa paan nahin kiya tha, yah dekhakar vishnu ne uske nirlypt bhav par prasann hokar use vardaan diya ki kah bina amrit piiye bhi ajar-amar hoga tathaa vishnu-dhwaja par uskaa sthaan rahegaa
 Garuda also accepted to be the vehicle of Vishnu
 maarg main indra mili
 Indra asked for the nectar and said that if the snakes drank it, they would be extremely hurt
 garud ne indra ko bataaya ki vah kisi uddeshy se amrit le ja rahaa he
 When he puts the elixir somewhere, Indra takes it
 indra ne prasann hokar garud ko vardaan diya ki sarp uski bhojan saamagree honge
 Later Garuda reached his mother
 usne sarpon ko soochna di ki vah amrit le aayaa he
 Release the snake plea from slavery and take a bath
 usne kushasan par amrit-kalash rakh diyaan jab tak sarp snaan karke laute, indra ne amrit chura liya tha
 The snakes licked Kusha itself, causing two parts of their tongue, so they started to be called Dwijivah
 indra ko blakhilya maharishiyon se bahut irshyaa thi
 Unhappy, Balkhilya gave part of his penance to Kashyapa Muni and asked him to destroy the item of Indra
 kashyap ne suparna tathaa kadru se vivaah kiya
 After both of them conceived, they went away by asking them to stay in the house with virtue
 unke jane ke baad donon patniyaan rishiyon ke yagyon main jane lageen
 They used to contaminate the future even when both the sages refused
 at: unke shaap se ve nadiyaan ban gayin
 On returning, Kashyap came to know
 rishiyon ke kehane se unhone shivaradhana kii
 When Shiva was pleased, he was blessed that both the rivers would join the Ganges and assume female form again
 aisa hi hone par prajapati kashyap ne donon kaa simantonnayan sanskaar kiya
 At the time of the yajna, Kadru ridiculed the rishis by pointing with one eye
 at: unke shaap se vah kani ho gayi
 Kashyap again pleased the sages in some way
 unke kathananusaar ganga snaan se usne pun: purvarup dhaaran kiya
