 In this way, these bodies establish a link between cosmology and geology
 yadhyapi manushya in tuutate hue taron se atyant pracheen samay se parichit tha, tathaapi aadhunik vigyaan ke vikasyug main manushya ko yah vishwaas karne main bahut samay laga ki bhootal par paae gaye ye pind prithvi par akaash se aae hai
 In the late 18th century, a philosopher named D
 Trouille, describing the meteorite that fell at the location of Alberto in Italy, conceived the idea that it must have come in the form of a star bursting from the mantle, but no one paid attention to it
 san 1768 i
 main fadar basile ne france main luus naamak sthaan par ek ulkapind ko prithvi par aate hue swat: dekha
 The following year he read an article on this account in the session of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris
 academi ne vrittant par vishwaas na karte hue ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye ek ayog niyukt kiya jiske prativedan main fadar basile ke vrittant ko bhramaatmak bataate hue yah mantavya prakat kiya gaya ki bijli gir jane se pind kaa prishth kuch is prakaar kaanch sadrush ho gaya tha jisase basile ko yah bhram hua ki yah pind prithvi kaa ansh nahin hai
 Later, the German philosopher Claudney, studying a meteorite from Siberia in 1794, proposed the theory that the bodies are representative of the mantle
 yadhyapi is baar bhi yah vichaar turant sweekaar nahin kiya gaya, phir bhi cladni ko is prasang par dhyaan aakarshith karne kaa shrey mila or tab se vaigyanik is vishay par adhik manoyog dene lage
 In 1803, there was a huge rainstorm of meteorites at La Aigil location in France, in which countless small and big stones fell and often two or three thousand of them could be collected
 vigyaan kii francisi academi ne us vrishti kii puri chaanbin kii or ant main kisi ko bhi yah andeh nahin rahaa ki ulkapind vastut: khamandal se hi prithvi par aate hai
 The main classification of meteorites is based on their organization
 kuch pind adhikanshat: lohe, nikal yaa mishradhaatuon se bane hote hai or kuch silicket khanijon se bane pathar sadrush hote hai
 The first class is called metallic and the second class is called meteoric meteorite
 iske atirikt kuch pindon main dhatvik or aashmik padaarth praaia: samaan maatra main paae jate hai, unhen dhatvashmik ulkapind kehete hai
 In fact, meteorites of all kinds of intercastes are found between completely metallic and completely wondrous invertebrates, which often makes it difficult to decide the class of bodies
 sanrachana ke aadhaar par teenon virgo main upbhed kiye jate hai
 There are two main strains in the heavenly bodies, one is called chondrite and the other is acoundrite
 pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa mukhya lakshan yah he ki unamem kuch vishisht vrittakar dane, jinhen kaundrul kehete hai, upasthit rahete hai
 Ponds in which the tendrils are not present are called achondrites
 dhatvik ulkapindon main bhi do mukhya upbhed hai jinhen kramash: ashtani or shashthanik kehete hai
 These names express the inner structure of the bodies and, as these names express, the bonds of metallic material in the first differential objects are configured in the octagonal shape and in the second in the crystalline shape
 is prakaar kii rachana ko vidamanstator kehete hai evam yah pindon ke marjeet prishth par badi sugamawa se pahachaani ja sakati he
 There are also two main subclasses in the metaphysical meteorites, which are called palacite and semi-metaphysical
 inamen se pehle upvarg ke pindon kaa aashmik ang mukhyat: aulivin khanij se bana hota he jiske sfat praaia: vrittakar hote hai or jo louh-nikal dhaatuon ke ek tantra main samaavrutt rahete hai
 Semi-metallic meteorites mainly contain pyroxene and small amounts of anorthite feldspars
 purv prakaran main yah ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki dhatvik or aashmik angon kii pradhanta ke aadhaar par ulkapind vargeekrut kiye jate hai
 But there does not seem to be any definite basis for the distribution of chemical elements and minerals in these bodies
 ulkapindon ke teen mukhya virgon ke atirikt anekanek upvarg hai jinamein se prayek kaa apana pruthak vishesh khanij samudaay he
 So far, 25 new classes have been detected and often one new subclass is being detected every two years
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki adhyayan ke liye uplabdh padaarth atyant alp maatra main hote hai
 So far the presence of only 52 chemical elements in meteorites has been certified, whose names are as follows: 
 Oxygen
 gandhak
 Platinum
 loha 
 argon gallium
 Phosphorus vung arsenic jarmenium barium vanadium Indium zirconium beryllium
 silicon 
 iridium
 Titanium
 manganeez sizium 
 antimony telurium meganecium sirium 
 aluminium
 Copper molybdenum sis 
 Carbon Thulium Yeshad
 sodium Cadmium
 nitrogen rajat scandium 
 calcium
 Out
 ruthenium swarna 
 coblt paarad rubidium straunsium 
 chromium
 Palladium
 radium
 Hydrogen 
 Chlorine
 potacium lithium
 Helium in 52 tatwon main se keval aath prachur maatra main paae jate hai, jinamein haalon sabase pramukh he
 The other seven are sequentially Oxygen, Silicon, Manganese, Sulfur, Aluminum, Nickel and Calcium
 inke atirikt 20 anya tatv paryaapt maatra main paae jate hai tathaa unki upasthiti kaa pataa saadhaaran rasinic vishleshan dwaara 1926 se purv hi lag chukaa tha
 The remaining 24 elements are present in very small quantities and their presence has been proved by spectral analysis
 khanij sanrachana kii drushti se ulkapindon or prithvi main pai gai shail raashiyon ke lakshanon main kai antar hote hai
 Generally, iron and nickel are very rare in independent metallic forms in global rock deposits, but in meteorites, metals are found in abundance in pure form, and often indispensably
 iske atirikt kai aise khanij hai jo bhumadleey shailon main nahin paae jate, par ulkapindon main milte hai
 Chief among these are Oldemite and Schreiberite
 ye donon khanij nami or oxigen kii bahulata main sthaayee nahin hote or isi kaaran bhumandaleey shailon main nahin milte
 Their presence suggests that the meteorites originated in an environment where the conditions of oxidation were lower than on the planet
 aashmik ulkapindon main saadharantaya piroxin or aulivin kii prachurtaa evam felsapaar kaa abhaav hota he, jisase unka sanghathan bhumandal kii atibhasmik shailon ke sadrush hota he
 The subject of the origin of meteorites is very controversial
 is vishay par anek mat samay samay par prastaavit hue hai, jinamein se kuch main inhen prithvi, chandramaa, surya or dhoomaketu aadi kaa ansh mana gaya he
 According to a very popular belief, they originated from a planet which is completely destroyed now
 is vichaar main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki aadi main praaia: mangal ke aakaar kaa ek grah rahaa hoga jo kisi duusare bade grah ke atyant sameep aa jane par, athwa kisi duusare grah se takaraakar, vinasht ho gaya, jisase arabon kii sankhya main chote bade khand bane jo ulka rup main khamandal main vichar rahe hai
 According to this view, the metallic meteors represent the central part of the fictitious planet and the astounding meteors represent the upper surface
 yadhyapi is upakalpana se ulkapindon ke anek lakshanon kii vyakhya ho jaati he, phir bhi anek baaten anbujhi paheli rah jaati hai
 For example, some metallic meteorites have an octahedral structure that is usually destroyed at 800 ° C
 aisa vishwaas he ki us kalpit grah ke vikhandan ke samay avashya hi usamen adhik taap utpann hua hoga
 Still, it is not understood how this octagonal composition survived
 isi prakaar yah shankaa bhi bani rahati he ki akundrite aashmik ulka main loha kahan se aayaa or kaundrite aashmik ulka main kaunduul kaise bane
 In another opinion, it has been proposed that meteorites originated with the planets, or rather, that the solar system and all cosmic matter originated from meteorites
 is kalpana ke anusaar aadi vishwa ulkapindon se paripurna tha ev kalantar main ve pind vibhinn punjon main ekatrit hote gaye tathaa unke adhikadhik ghanikaran ke krmanusaar gasamay noharika, nakshatra evam grah utpann hue
 a major error of this imagination seems to be that meteorites present in the mantle are so dispersed and their mutual attraction is so weak that it will take too much time to collect and form a large amount
 kintu isamen koi andeh nahin ki ek baar paryaapt bade aakaar kii raashi ban jane ke baad vah apni satta banaae rakh sakegaa or kalantar main or adhik pindon ko apane main milakar apane aakaar kii vruddhi bhi kar sakegaa
 It is possible to partially modify the above methods to determine their actual method of origin
 ulkapindon kaa ek brihat sangrah kalkatte ke bhartiya sangrahalay ke bhuvaigyanik vibhaag main pradarshit he
 It is supervised by the Geological Survey of India
 prachlit niyamon ke anusaar desh main kahin bhi gira hua ulkapind sarkari sampatti hota he
 Anyone who finds such a body has the duty to refer it to the local collector from where it is sent to the Geological Survey of India Department

 Apart from this, samples received from abroad are also kept in this collection

 The partition of India into agriculture and the need for immediate attention was considered to be the most difficult
 a total planned budget of 206,8 billion was allocated to seven broad areas: irrigation and energy
 For agriculture and community development, transport and communication, industry, social services, land rehabilitation and other sectors and services
 The most important feature of this phase was the active role in all the economic sectors of the state

 In 1774, in the city of Rangoon, Burma, King Hassinbushin of Burma decided to hold a seven-day and seven-night religious festival in honor of the relics of the Buddha

 At one point, King Hsienbushin wanted to see how Mayan Boran could be compared with the Burmese art Lethwei
 naai khanomathome ko burmese champion ke khilaaf ladane ke liye chunaa gaya
 The boxing ring was erected in front of the throne and Nai Khanomtom performed a traditional y crew dance before the battle to show respect to his teachers and ancestors, as well as to show respect for the audience by dancing around his opponent 
 isane burma ke logon ko hairaan kar diya, ve uljhan main pad gaye, unhen laga ki yah kaala jaadu he
 When the fight began, Nai Khanomtom attacked his opponent using punch, kick, elbow and knee until he was battered
 haalanki burma ke referi ne kaha ki burma kaa champion kik se bahut adhik vichlit ho gaya tha or nokout ko amaanya ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The king then said that Nai Khanomtom would have to fight nine Burmese champions to prove himself
 vah sahamat ho gaya or usne bich main bina aaraam kiye, ek ek karke sabase ladaai kii
 His last opponent was a great teacher of kickboxing from Rakhine
 nai khanomathome ne use apni kicks se ghayal kar diya, iske baad kisi or ne use chunauti dene kii himmat nahin jutai
 King Mangara was so impressed that he reportedly remarked, "every part of Thai is full of poison
" nihattha hote hue bhi vah nau das pratidwandviyon ko haraa saktaa he
 But his master was incompetent and lost his country to the enemy
 agar vah sakasham hota to aisa ho hi nahin saktaa tha ki ayuthaya shahar kaa patan ho jaataa
 King Mangra freed Nai Khanomtom, and also asked him to choose for himself money or one of two beautiful wives
 Nai Khanomtom chose wives because he told that wealth could be obtained easily
 iske baad vah apni patniyon ke saath siam chalaa gaya
 Other versions of this story suggest that his fellow Thai prisoners were also released as a result of his victory

 Formal Muay Thai techniques are divided into two groups: mei mai or main techniques and luk mai or short techniques
 may thai aksar sangharshan kii ek ladaai kii kala he, jisamen virdohi ek duusare ke saath mudraon kaa vinimay karte hai
 This is certainly prevalent among traditional players in Thailand, but is a less popular art in the contemporary world where the Thai style of currency exchange is not more favorable for currency
 may thai kii lagbhag sabhi takneekon main puure sharir kii gatiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, har kik, panch, albo or block ke saath kulhon main ghurnan kiya jaataa he

 pashchimi boxing or pashchimi marshall arts ke saath sankaran ke dwaara pashchimi boxing panchon kii puri range kaa ab upyog kiya jaataa he: lead job, street / kros, hook, aprakat, shoval or corcscru panch or overhands or saath hi hemer fist or back fist
 Compared to most other striking martial arts, body piercing is used less as a tactic in Muay Thai to protect the blower's head from knees and elbow counter strikes
 lakshya binduon kii range kaa upyog karne ke liye, kendriya rekha siddhant ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, pratiyogi pashchimi yaa thai mudra kaa upyog kar saktaa he, jo sangrakshan se samjhauta kiye bina lambi yaa choti range ke praharon ko prabhavi rup se karne main madad karata he
 The elbow can be used as a stabbing weapon in several ways: diagonal upwards, diagonal-downwards, uppercuts, downwards, backward-spinning, and flying
 said se iskaa upyog ek phinishing move ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he yaa is tarah se pratidwandvi kii bhunh ko kaatane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he jisase khun uski drushti ko block kar saktaa he
 Diagonal elbows are faster than any other strike but are less powerful
 single albo or ek pholo-ap albo ke bich ek spasht antar he
 a single elbow is a hit that is independent of any other hit, while a follow-up elbo is the second hit to be the same arm, with the first hit being a hook or straight punch, followed by the elbow follow-up
 
 kohni ke aise praharon or kohni ke anya praharon kaa upyog, tab kiya jaataa he jab pratidwandviyon ke bich kii duuri bahut kam ho jaati he or pratidwandvi ke sir par hook kaa prahaar karne ke liye jagah bahut kam hoti he
 Elbow blows are used to block an opponent's blows, protect themselves from it, and minimize its impact, for example spring knee, side body knee, body kick or punch
 may thai main do sabase aam kik thip or te chiang yaa angel kik kehalaati hai
 Muay Thai's angle kick uses a rotating motion of the entire body and has also been widely adopted by other martial arts professionals
 yah satahi rup se karate kii round house kik ke samaan he, lekin isamen ghutane se lower leg kaa ghurnan nahin hota, jo ki adhikansh karate or taikvondo jaisi anya striking marshall arts main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Because in Kukushin, Goju and Kenpo it is performed in a round posture, with the posterior leg slightly lower than the upper body fighting
 yah karate or tikvondo ke vipareet jokhim ko badhaata he, udhaaharan ke liye ek kik ke baad ke thode se kshan apwaad hai
 Angle kick forces the body completely; The rotation of the hips is applied by motion
 aisi soch he ki kai pratidwandvi is kik kii kshamta ko teevr banane ke liye bhujaa ke counter roteshan kaa upyog karte hai, lekin vastav main kshamta kulhon se aati he or bhujaaon ko bataai gayi avasthaa main rakhaa jaataa he
 If a round house kick has been hit by an opponent, the Thai boxer will usually check the kick and block the kick from his shin
 The Thai boxer is trained to always be associated with the shin
 pair main kai choti haddiyaan hoti hai or yah kamjor hota he
 If a contestant tries to hit with his leg or instep, he can protect himself from injury
 may thai main kai anya prakaar ke kik bhi shaamil hai, jaise said kik or spinning back kik
is prakaar kii kik kaa upyog kuch pratiyogiyon ke dwaara keval muqablon main hi kiya jaataa he
 According to a written source, this technique is more modern than Khao Dot or Khao Loi
 mana jaataa he, jab thai boxr boxing ke aadhunik dastaanon ke bajaay rassi se bandhe haathon se ladate the, tab is vishesh takanic kaa upyog ek sachet pratidwandvi ke dwaara shaatir tareeke se kating, slising or soing main kiya jaataa tha
 While the front opponent used to prevent this strike from the sharp edges of the "rope gloves", sometimes the rope was soaked in water and wet so that the rope would become stronger
 This description is also true for some knee strikes below
 foot-thrust yaa shabdic rup se foot-jaib may thai kii takneekon main se ek he
 It is mainly used to block attacks ie to stop and control the distance
 foot-thrust ko bahut teji se daalaa janaa chahie lekin saath hi yah itnaa shashakt bhi hona chahie ki yah pratidwandvi ke santulan ko bigaad sake
 In Western boxing, the two rivals are separated when they grab each other; In Muay Thai, however, this is not done
 is jakadan yaa clinch main ghutane or kohni kii takneekon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In the clinch, small amounts of stand-up grappling are used to strike and block the opponent for both offensive and defensive purposes
 front clinch kaa upyog ek haath kii hatheli se duusare ke pichley hisse par kiya jaataa he
 There are three reasons why fingers should not be used
 1) The opponent in the ring is wearing gloves, so he cannot use his fingers
 2) In Thai front clinch, the opponent's head is pressed downwards, this is easier when the hands are closed behind the head and not behind the neck
 Apart from this, maximum pressure should be put on the neck as far as possible by the arms
 3) If an opponent uses the fingers, his or her fingers may be hurt and it becomes more difficult to grip the front opponent's head to hit the elbow faster
 ek sahi clinch main pratiyogi apni bhujaa ke agle hisse se pratidwandvi kii collar bone ko dabaata he, is samay uske haath pratidwandvi kii gardan ke chaaron ore naa hokar uske sir ke chaaron ore hote hai
 a common way to get out of this clinch is to push the opponent's head backwards or hit the elbow, because the clinch requires both contestants to be very close to each other
 iske atirikt, ek aprabhavi clinchar apni bhujaaon ko neeche kii ore tathaa pratidwandvi ke clinch ke andar "tairaane" kii koshish kar saktaa he, jisase aprabhavi clinchar ek prabhavi clinchar ban saktaa he
 There are several other types of clinch or chep khao in Muay Thai, including: may thai main raksha yaa bachaav ko chah samoohon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he: For example, the defender moves his front leg backwards to avoid the offensive's low kick and then immediately strikes back with an angle kick
 yaa rakshak apane sir ko aakraamak kii unchi angel kik se peeche kar letaa he or ek said kik ke saath javaabi prahaar karata he
 For defense, the concept of "wall of defense" is used, using the shoulders, arms and legs to prevent the aggressor from implementing the technique
 blocking yaa avrodh may thai main ek jatil avyav he or isamen niyamon kaa vah str shaamil he jo ek safal peshewar main hona chahie
lo or mid bodi roundouse kik ko aamtaur par uthaai hui shin ke upari bhaag se roka jaataa he
 High body strikes are prevented with the forearm, glove, elbow or shin
 midsection roundouse kik ko bhi pakadaa / roka ja saktaa he, jisase pratidwandvi ke taang ke shesh hisse par balpurvak yaa javaabi prahaar karne main madad milti he
 The punch is prevented with a simple boxing guard or similar technique, the basic technique of boxing can be used if similar technique cannot be used
 ek panch ko rokane ke liye saamanyatya panch ke aane kii disha kii said se haath kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a conservative contestant puts a jab, the defender will put a slight tape in the direction of the angle of the punch with his right hand
 The deflection should always be short and precise so that there is no unnecessary expenditure of energy and the hand should be returned to the guard as soon as possible
 The hook is often restrained at a pace that is described as "combing the hair", that is, lifting the elbow forward and effectively protecting the head with the help of forearms, flexible biceps, and shoulders
 
 adhik unnat may thai block aamtaur par counter hai, jinka upyog agle hamale ko rokane ke liye aakraamak ko kshati pahuchane main kiya jaataa he
 Like most competitive full-contact, fighting games, Muay Thai Bodi focuses heavily on conditioning
 may thai ko vishesh rup se ring pratispardhaa ke liye aavashyak sharir kii fitness or jatilta ke str ko badhaava dene ke liye banaaya gaya he
 During the training of this complex sport many exercises are done such as running, shedoboxing, rope jumping, body weight blocking exercises, medicine ball exercises, abdominal exercises and in some cases weight training
 Muay Thai professionals usually apply Namman Mu before and after their intensive training sessions
 prashikshan jo may thai ke pratiyogi ke liye vishesh he, usamen thai pads, focus mits, baari bag or spering aadi ke saath prashikshan shaamil he
 In different methods of practice, daily training consists of several rounds
 Thai pad training is an important part of Muay Thai conditioning, in which punch, kick, knee and elbow strikes are practiced with an instructor who wears thick pads on his arms and forearms
 in vishesh pads kaa upyog aakraamak ke prahaar ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or isse aakraamak pad holder ke prahaar kaa jawaab sajiv rup main de paata he
 The trainer also often wears a belly pad to cover his abdominal area, allowing the aggressor to hit a straight kick or knee at his body at any time during the round

 The Ved Vyas have not only been the authors of the Mahabharata, but have also been witness to the events which have taken place in chronological order
 apane ashram se hastinapur kii samast gatividhiyon kii soochna un tak to pahunchati thi
 He also used to give his advice on those incidents
 jab-jab antardvandv or sankat kii sthiti aati thi, mata satyavati unase vichaar-vimarsh ke liye kabhi ashram pahunchati, to kabhi hastinapur ke rajbhavan main aamantrit karti thi
 In every Dwapara Yuga, Vishnu appeared as Vyasa and presented the divisions of Vedas
 pehle dwapar main swayan brahma vedavyas hue, duusare main prajapati, tisare dwapar main shukracharya, chauthe main brihaspati vedavyas hue
 Similarly, Surya, Death, Indra, Dhananjaya, Krishna Dvaipayana Ashwatthama etc
 were twenty-eight Ved Vyas
 is prakaar atthaees baar vedon kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya
 He also composed eighteen Puranas, it is believed
 vedavyas yah vyas muni tathaa parashar ityadi naamon se bhi jane jate he
 He was the son of Parashar Muni, hence Vyas is also known as 'parashar'

 He went to the forest for hunting one day
 unke jane ke baad hi unki patni rajaswala ho gai
 He sent this news to the king through his bird of prey
 samachar paakar maharaj sudhanva ne ek done main apana veery nikaal kar pakshi ko de diya
 The bird flew into the sky to bring the two to the king's wife
 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds
 yuddh ke dauraan vah dona pakshi ke panje se chhot kar yamuna main ja gira
 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma
 machhlee rupi apsara done main behate huye veery ko nigal gai tathaa uske prabhaav se vah garbhvatee ho gai
 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net
 nishad ne jab machhlee ko chira to uske pet se ek balak tathaa ek balika nikali
 Nishad went to Maharaj Sudhanwa with those babies
 maharaj sudhanva ke putr na hone ke kaaran unhone balak ko apane paas rakh liya jiskaa naam matsayraj hua
 The girl remained near Nishad and was named Matsyagandha because the smell of fish emitted from her organs
 us kanya ko satyavati ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 When she grew up, she started doing boat work
 Once Parashar Muni had to sit on her boat and cross the Yamuna
 parashar muni satyavati rup-soundarya par aasakt ho gayi or bole, "devi! main tumhaare saath sahavaas karnaa chahta hoon
 "satyavati said," Muniver! You are a theologian and i am a Nishad girl
 hamaara sahavaas sambhav nahin he
 "then Parashar Muni said," Balike! Do not worry prasuti hone par bhi tum kumari hi rahogi
 "having said this, he created a thick mist network around his yoga force and indulged with Satyavati
 tatpashchaat use aashirwad dete huye kaha, tumhaare sharir se jo machhlee kii gandh nikalati he vah sugandh main parivartit ho jaayegi

 According to Hindu scriptures, Maharishi Vyasa was a trikala
 tathaa unhone divya drushti se dekh kar jaan liya ki kaliyug main dharm ksheen ho jaayegaa
 Due to the degeneration of religion, humans will become atheists, dutyless and young
 ek vishaal veda kaa sangopang adhyayan unke samarth se baahar ho jaayegaa
 That is why Maharishi Vyas divided the Vedas into four parts so that even those with less intelligence and less memory could study the Vedas
 vyas ji ne unka naam rakhaa - rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda
 Vyas ji became famous as Ved Vyas because of the division of Vedas
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ko kramshah apane shishy pel, jaimin, vaishampayan or sumantumuni ko padhaayaa
 Veda Vyasa composed the Puranas in the form of the fifth Veda in which the knowledge of Veda is told in the form of interesting stories, because the knowledge contained in Veda is very esoteric and dry
 puraanon ko unhone apane shishy rome harshan ko padhaayaa
 Vyas ji's disciples made many branches and sub-branches of those Vedas according to their own wisdom
 vyas ji ne mahabharat kii rachana kii
 The great Vibhuti of the mythological-epic era, Mahabharata, Eighteen Puranas, Srimadbhagavata, Brahmasutra, Mimamsa, the founder of unique literature-philosophy, Ved Vyas, was born around 3000 BC on Ashada Purnima

 He was born in an island of Yamuna in Kalpi

 As soon as he was born, he went to do penance with the mother's command and said that whenever you will remember, i will come

 After studying the Vedas, he taught his disciples Sumantu, Jaimini, Pal and Vaishampayan, and his son Shukadeva, and preached the Mahabharata
 aapaki is alokik pratibha ke kaaran aapako bhagwaan kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 Vyasa has become the best poet in Sanskrit literature after Valmiki
 inke likhe kavy 'aarsh kavy' ke naam se vikhyath hai
 The purpose of Vyas ji is not to describe the war by writing Mahabharata, but to show the essence of this physical life
 unka kathan he ki bhale hi koi purush vedang tathaa upanishdon ko jaan le, lekin vah kabhi vichkshan nahin ho saktaa kyonki yah mahabharat ek hi saath arthshaastra, dharamshastra tathaa kaamshaastra he

 University Fellow of Calcutta ORCID is a nonproprietary alphanumeric code to uniquely identify scientific and other academic authors
 This addresses the problem that a particular author's contributions to the scientific literature can be hard to electronically recognize as most personal names are not unique, they can change, have cultural differences in name order, contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations and employ different writing systems
 It provides a persistent identity for humans, similar to that created for content-related entities on digital networks by digital object identifiers 
 The ORCID organization offers an open and independent registry intended to be the de facto standard for author identification in science and related academic publishing
 On 16 October 2012, ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers
 ORCID was first organized as the "open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative"
 a prototype was developed on software adapted from that used by Thomson Reuters for its researcherid system
 The registry is now an independent nonprofit organization, ORCID, Inc
, incorporated in August 2010
 Its executive Director, Laure Haak, was appointed in April 2012
 ORCID is freely usable and interoperable with other ID systems
 ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers on 16 oktober 2012
 Formally, ORCID ids are specified as uris, for example, the ORCID for John Wilbanks is http: / / orcid
org / xxrep 4 0 -0002-4510-0385
 However, some publishers use the short form, e
g
 "ORCID: xxrep 4 0 -0002-4510-0385"
 ORCID is a subset of the International Standard Name Identifier, under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization and the two organizations are cooperating
 ISNI will uniquely identify contributors to books, television programmes, and newspapers, and has reserved a block of identifiers for use by ORCID, in the range xxrep 4 0 -0001-5000-0007 to xxrep 4 0 -0003-5000-0001
 It is therefore possible for a person to legitimately have both an ISNI and an ORCID - effectively, two isnis
 Both ORCID and ISNI use 16-character identifiers, using the digits 0-9, and separated into groups of four by hyphens
 The final character, which may also be a letter "X" representing the value "10", is a MOD 11-2 check digit conforming to the ISO / IEC 7064:2003 standard
 An ORCID account for a fictitious person, Josiah Carberry, exists as http: / / orcid
org / xxrep 4 0 -0002-1825-0097, for use in testing and training examples
 The aim of ORCID is to aid "the transition from science to e-science, wherein scholarly publications can be mined to spot links and ideas hidden in the ever-growing volume of scholarly literature"
 Another suggested use is to provide each researcher with "a constantly updated ‘digital curriculum vitae’ providing a picture of his or her contributions to science going far beyond the simple publication list
" The idea is that other organizations will use the open-access ORCID database to build their own services
 It has been noted in an editorial in nature that ORCID, in addition to tagging the contributions that scientists make to papers, "could also be assigned to data sets they helped to generate, comments on their colleagues' blog posts or unpublished draft papers, edits of Wikipedia entries and much else besides "
 In April 2014, ORCID announced plans to work with the Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information to record and acknowledge contributions to peer review
 By the end of 2013 ORCID had 111 member organizations and over 460,000 registrants
 As of 30 May 2014, the number of registrants was 727,454
 The organizational members include many publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, Wiley and Nature Publishing Group
 Others are research institutions, commercial companies including Thomson Reuters, academic societies and a charitable foundation, the Wellcome Trust
 In June 2014, ORCID announced that it had appointed Andy Mabbett as its Wikipedian in Residence
 In addition to members and sponsors, a number of journals, publishers, and other services have included ORCID in their workflows or databases
 For example, the Journal of Neuroscience, Springer Publishing, the Hindawi Publishing Corporation, Europe pubmed Central, the Japanese National Institute of Informatics's Researcher Name Resolver, Wikipedia, and Wikidata
 Some online services have created tools for exporting date to, or importing data from, ORCID
 These include Scopus and Figshare
 Thomson Reuters have enabled data exchange between ORCID and its researcherid system, and vice versa
 Third-party tools allow the migration of content from other services into ORCID, for example ODIN, for datacite and mendeley2orcid, for Mendeley
 Some ORCID data may also be retrieved as RDF

 hindu dharm main vedon ke sandarbh main apaurusheyatawad vah mat he jo maanati he ki veda 'apaurushey' hai arthath vedon ko kisi ne nahin rachaa he - na to manushya ne or na hi kisi daivi shakti ne
 The Vedas are also called by the word 'apoorusheya'
 veda ke ke aavirbhaav ke vishay main naiyayikon or tadbhin darshanikon ke, visheshat: mimasakon ke, mat main bada parthaky he
 The view of justice is that Veda is 'pourusheya', being composed by God, but in Sankhya, Vedanta and Mimamsa, Veda has its own invention; For him, the efforts of any person, even omniscient God, are not helpful
 purush dwaara uccharitamaatr hone se bhi koi vastupaaurushey nahin hoti, pratyut drushti ke samaan adrusht main bhi buddhipurvak nirmaan hon par hi 'paurusheyata' aati he

 vedon main sthaan-sthaan par uplabdh babar pravahani aadi ke samaan shabd kisi vyaktivishesh ke vaachak na hokar nity padaarth ke nirdeshak hai 
 The attempt to find cosmic history in the Vedas, which are the proponents of spiritual knowledge, is absolutely futile
 is prakaar swat: aavirbhoot veda kisi purush kii rachana na hone se 'aporushey' hai
 The name of this principle is 'apotheism'

 For example, Bölkstein's direction was accused of being in some form of "social dumping" in Europe because it preferred competition among workers, as exemplified by the Polish plumber stereotype

 Whereas with the approval of the World Trade Organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade allows countries to choose to take action against dumping
 anti-damping samjhauta anuchhed VI ko spasht karata he or vistaar detaa he or donon saath-saath kaary karte hai
 These allow countries to act in such a way that gatt's principle of keeping a binding fee and not discriminating between trading partners is commonly violated - especially anti-dumping action to mean a particular exporter In order to bring its price closer to the "fair value" on a particular commodity of the country or to remove the loss to the domestic industry in the importing country, In addition to imposing import duties
 kisi khaas utpaada ko baari maatra main yaa ise keval thodi maatra main damp kiya ja rahaa he iskaa hisaab-kitaab lagane ke kai tareeke hai
 The agreement minimizes the difference of possible options
 yah kisi utpaada ke "uchit mulya" kaa hisaab-kitaab lagane ke teen tareeke bataata he
 The most prominent method is based on the exporter's current price in the domestic market
 jab iskaa prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa he to do anya vikalp uplabdh hai - kisi duusare desh main niryaatak dwaara lee ja rahi keemat yaa niryaatak kii utpaadan laagat, anya kharchon or saamaanya munaafe ke antar kaa sanyukt rup se hisaab-kitaab lagane ke aadhaar par
 saath hi samjhauta yah bhi nirdeshit karata he ki niryaat mulya or ek saamaanya keemat kya hogi, uske bich kaise ek nishpaksh tulana kii ja sakati he
 It is not enough to calculate the extent of dumping on a product
 anti-damping upayon ko keval tabhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he jab damping ayatak desh main udyog ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa ho
 isliye pehle nirdisht niyamon ke anusaar isaki ek vistrut jaanch karai jaati he
 The investigation necessarily evaluates all the relevant economic aspects that have any influence in the state of the industry concerned
 agar jaanch se yah pataa chalata he ki damping ho rahi he or gharelu udyog ko nuksaan pahunchaaya ja rahaa he to niryaatak company anti-damping aayaat shulk se bachane ke kram main isaki keemat ko ek sahmati yogya str tak badhaane ke upaay kar sakati he
 Detailed procedures are set out for how to deal with anti-dumping cases, how to complete the process of investigation and to ensure that all interested parties are given an opportunity to present their evidence
 anti-damping upaay iske lagu karne kii taarikh ke paanch varsh baad aavashyak rup se samaapt ho jate hai jab tak ki ek samiksha se yah pataa nahin chalata he ki is upaay ko samaapt karne se nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Anti-dumping investigations are to immediately eliminate cases where the authorities decide whether the margin of dumping is minimal or significantly reduced
 Other conditions have also been set
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar damp kiye gaye aayaat kii maatra naganya hoti he tab bhi maamle ko samaapt karne ke liye jaanch kii jaati he kii vivaad niptaan prakriya kaa bhi upyog kar sakate hai
 The anti-dumping of the European Union comes under the purview of the European Council
 yah europea parishad viniman 384 / 96 se sanchalit he
 However, the implementation of anti-dumping actions is followed by voting by various committees with member state representation
 anti-damping karravaayiyon par sadsy rajyon ko salaah dene ke liye jimmedaar aadhikarik sanstha brusselles main sthit vyapaar mahanideshaalay he
 The community industry may apply to initiate an anti-dumping investigation
 vyapaar mahanideshak pehle shikayatakartaaon ke daawey kii jaanch karata he
 If they get at least 25% representation of the community industry, then the investigation will probably start
 This process is guided by some specific guidance in the manuals
 vyapaar mahanideshak dwaara anti-damping salaahkaar samiti ke rup main jaani jane vaali ek samiti ko ek sifarish kar diya jayega, jis par prayek sadsy rajya ke paas ek vot he
 The Member State's failure to participate in voting will be deemed to have voted in favor of industrial security, a voting system that has come under severe criticism
 jaanch shuru karne ke liye nirdhaarit maapdand ke anusaar europea sangh kii anti-damping karravaayiyon ko mukhya rup se "vyapaar suraksha" portpholio kaa ek hissaa mana jaataa he
 Consumer interests and non-industry related interests are not emphasized during the investigation
 kisi bhi jaanch main vishesh rup se saamudayik nirmaataaon ko damping ke kaaran hue nuksaan par dhyaan diya jaataa he or nirdhaarit shulk kaa str damping ke jariye saamudayik nirmaataaon ko hue nuksaan ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 If consensus is not reached then the decision goes to the European Council
 lagu kiye jane par shulk saidhantik taur par paanch varshon tak maanya rahata he
 In practice these last for at least one year as the termination review usually starts at the end of five years and the status quo is maintained during the review process
 damping jaanch main aropit damping raashtra kii gharelu keemton kii tulana europea bazaar main aaayaatit utpaada kii keemton ke saath anivaary rup se kii jaati he
 However a number of rules are applied to the data before calculating the dumping margin
 sabase vivaadaaspad "samanaantar bazaar" kii avadharana he
 Some exporting countries are not given "market economy status" by the European Union: China is a prime example of this
 aise maamalon main vyapaar mahanideshak ko gharelu mulya ke uchit upaay ke rup main gharelu keemton kaa upyog karne se roak diya jaataa he
 a particular exporting industry may also lose market status if it is concluded by the Director General of Trade that the industry receives government support
 anya lagu pareekshanon main antarrashtriya lekha maanakon or diwaliyapan sambandhi kanoonon ke aavedan shaamil hai
 Not being given the status of market economy has a wide impact on the investigation process
 udhaaharan ke liye agar china par vigates kii damping kaa aarope he to buniyadi drushtikon europe main chini vigates ke mulya ke khilaaf china main vigates ke mulya par vichaar karnaa he
 But China does not have the status of market economy, so the domestic prices of sugar cannot be used as a reference
 isaki bajaay vyapaar mahanideshak ko anivaary rup se ek samanaantar bazaar ke aadhaar par faisla karnaa hota he: ek aisa bazaar jise bazaar arthvyavastha kaa darja hasil he or jo kaaphi had tak china ke samaan he
 Brazil and Mexico have been used for this, but the United States is a popular parallel market
 is maamle main sanyukt rajya america main vigates ke mulya ko china main vigates ke mulya ke liye vikalp ke rup main mana jaataa he
 This process of choosing a parallel market is subject to the influence of the complainant which has given rise to some criticisms that it is an inherent bias in the process
 haalanki, china aise deshon main se ek he jahaan shram shakti sabase sasti he
 According to the criticisms, it is largely inappropriate to compare the value of Chinese goods in parallel with that of the United States
 china 60 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main apni ek suniyojit-arthvyavastha ke vipareet ab ek apekshaakrit adhik swatantra or khule bazaar ke rup main viksit ho rahaa he, china kaa bazaar vaishvik pratispardhaa ko adhik se adhik gale lagane ko taiyaar he
 That is why it needs to improve its position in order to assess its "dumping" behavior and improve its market rules and overcome the barriers of free trade in order to create a properly fixed price level
 europea sangh kii aam krishi niti par aksar damping kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he haalanki 1992 main gat vaarta ke urugve daur main or iske baad ke vriddhishil sudhaaron, visheshkar 2003 main luxmberg samjhaute main, krishi sambandhi samjhaute ke ek hisse ke rup main mahatvapurn sudhaaron ke upaay taiyaar kiye gaye the
 To begin with, the CAP initially supported European farmers through a process of market intervention to increase European agricultural production and through a special fund - the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund - from a centrally determined level of value In the event of a fall, there was an attempt to purchase additional agricultural production
 is upaay ke jariye europea kisaanon ko europea samudaay main apane utpaadan ko bechney kii sthiti main ek "guarantee mulya" diya gaya tha
 In addition to this internal measure, an export-related refund mechanism ensured that European products sold outside the European Community would be sold at a global price or less so as not to cause any harm to the European manufacturer
 vishwa vyapaar ko vikrut karne ke liye is niti kii baari aalochana kii gayi thi or 1992 kii niti ke baad se is niti ko bazaar ke hastkshep or utpaadan kii parvaah kiye bina kisaanon ko sidhe bhugtan karne ke prayaas kii disha se dur kar diya gaya he
 In addition, payments are typically made to farmers based on meeting certain environmental or animal welfare requirements to encourage a responsible, long-term farming called a "multi-purpose" agricultural subsidy - That is, where social, environmental and other benefits are given through subsidies which do not include a simple increase in production
