 like - ek sarvasamika he
 whereas ek sameekaran he jiskaa mul hai x = 0 { \ displaystyle x=0} evam x = 1 { \ displaystyle x=1} 
 If an equation is true, then sameekaran ke ek paksh main sthit koi char, achar, vyanjak aadi ko duusare paksh main le jane ko pakshaantar kaha jaataa he

 Instead of solid steel, thin laminations are used to reduce vortex current damage

 Silicon is its second component which increases the resistivity of this steel and helps in unification of multi-crystals

 Carbon also causes magnetic aging when it slowly leaves solid solutions and precipitates as carbides, thus resulting in an increase in power loss over time
 For these reasons, the carbon level is kept to 0,005% or less

 Amorphous steel has poor mechanical properties and costs about twice as much as conventional steel in 2010, some larger distribution type transformers

 Fully processed steels are usually distributed with insulating coating, full heat treatment and defined magnetic properties, for applications where punching operations do not significantly degrade material properties
 Excessive bending, incorrect heat treatment, or even rough handling of core steel can adversely affect its magnetic properties and may also increase the noise due to magnetostriction
 The magnetic properties of electrical steels using the internationally standardized Epstein frame method Investigation is done
 practical chintaaon Core steel is much more expensive than mild steel
 In 1981 it cost more than twice per unit weight

 At the time of the third Caliph Uthman, Aisha had a prominent role in the opposition that grew against her, although she either did not agree with those responsible for her murder nor with Ali's party
 ali ke shasankaal ke dauraan, vah uthman kii mrityu kaa badla lenaa chaahati thi, jise usne oont kii ladaai main karne kaa prayaas kiya tha

 Later, she lived quietly in Medina for over twenty years, took no part in politics, joined Ali and did not oppose the Caliph Mu'awiya

 According to the sources of the Sunni scripture hadith, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad until she reached the age of nine or ten years, which is meant by many observers to point out For that she had reached puberty at this age
 udhaaharan ke liye, sahih al bukhari ne kaha ki aisha ne suna he ki jab vah chah varsh kii thi tab paigambar ne usase vivaah kiya or usne use puraa kar liya shaadi jab vah nau saal kii thi, or tab vah nau saal tak uske saath rahi
 Sahih al-bukhari, 7:62:64 haddees sangrah main aisha kii umr ko record karnaa paigambar kii mrityu ke kuch sadiyon baad aayaa, kyonki haddees vishwasaneey gavaahon kii ek satyapit akhand shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se praarambhik islam ke record

 Mohammad Niknam Arbahi, an Iranian Islamic scholar and historian, has considered six different approaches to determining Aisha's age and concludes that she was engaged in her late teens
 ek sandarbh bindu ke rup main fatima kii umr kaa upyog karte hue, lahore ahmadiya andolan vidwaan mohammad ali ne anumaan lagaaya he ki shaadi ke samay aisha das saal se adhik puraani thi or iske samaapan ke samay pandrah varsh se adhik thi
 American historian Dennis Spellberg has reviewed Islamic literature on Aisha's virginity, age at marriage, and age when the marriage ended and speculated that Aisha's youth exaggerated to leave no doubt about her virginity
 May have been done
 spelberg kehete hai, "aisha kii umr ebn saad main ek pramukh pre-vyavsaay he jahaan uski shaadi chah se saat ke bich badalati he, nau shaadi kii samaapti par uski umr ke rup main sthir dikhti he

 Therefore, there are two main tools of fiscal policy - change in tax level and structure and change in expenditure by the government in various items
 aisi koi arthvyavastha nahin he jo rajkoshiya niti yaa maudrik niti ke bina chal sakati ho
 But there is a debate as to which policy should play a major role in both for economic management
