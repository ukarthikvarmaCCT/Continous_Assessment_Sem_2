 iske mukhya chumbakeey gun hai - ucch parmiability tathaa kam hysterisis kshay 
 Instead of solid steel, thin laminations are used to reduce vortex current damage
 silicon steel main adhikansh loha hota he
 Silicon is its second component which increases the resistivity of this steel and helps in unification of multi-crystals

 carbon kii upasthiti sulfur yaa oxigen kii tulana main ek adhik hanikaarak prabhaav padataa he
 Carbon also causes magnetic aging when it slowly leaves solid solutions and precipitates as carbides, thus resulting in an increase in power loss over time
 For these reasons, the carbon level is kept to 0,005% or less
 carbon str hydrogen jaise ek decarburizing maahaul main steel annealing dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he

 Amorphous steel has poor mechanical properties and costs about twice as much as conventional steel in 2010, some larger distribution type transformers
 As for making it cost effective only for the coating coatings vidyut ispaat aamtaur par laminations ke bich vidyut pratirodh vruddhi hui he, ke liye jang yaa jang ke liye pratirodh pradaan karte hai or marane ke kaatane ke dauraan ek snehak ke rup main kaary lepit he
 There are various coatings, organic and inorganic, and the coating used depends on the application of the steel

 Magnetic properties vidyut steel ke chumbakeey gun garmi upachaar par nirbhar hai, ke rup main ausat crystal aakaar badhaane histoerisis haani kam ho jaati he
 Hysteresis loss is determined by a standard test and can range from about 2–10 watts per kilogram at 60 Hz and 1

 Fully processed steels are usually distributed with insulating coating, full heat treatment and defined magnetic properties, for applications where punching operations do not significantly degrade material properties
 Excessive bending, incorrect heat treatment, or even rough handling of core steel can adversely affect its magnetic properties and may also increase the noise due to magnetostriction
 The magnetic properties of electrical steels using the internationally standardized Epstein frame method Investigation is done
 practical chintaaon Core steel is much more expensive than mild steel
 In 1981 it cost more than twice per unit weight
 chadar main chumbakeey domen ke aakaar ek lager, yaa yantravat saath chadar kii sataha chihn dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he
 This greatly reduces the hysteresis deficit in the assembled core

 At the time of the third Caliph Uthman, Aisha had a prominent role in the opposition that grew against her, although she either did not agree with those responsible for her murder nor with Ali's party
 ali ke shasankaal ke dauraan, vah uthman kii mrityu kaa badla lenaa chaahati thi, jise usne oont kii ladaai main karne kaa prayaas kiya tha

 "the British historian William Montgomery Watt suggested that Muhammad hoped to strengthen his relationship with Abu Bakr; the strengthening of relations usually served as the basis of marriage in Arab culture

 According to the sources of the Sunni scripture hadith, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad until she reached the age of nine or ten years, which is meant by many observers to point out For that she had reached puberty at this age
 udhaaharan ke liye, sahih al bukhari ne kaha ki aisha ne suna he ki jab vah chah varsh kii thi tab paigambar ne usase vivaah kiya or usne use puraa kar liya shaadi jab vah nau saal kii thi, or tab vah nau saal tak uske saath rahi
 Sahih al-bukhari, 7:62:64 haddees sangrah main aisha kii umr ko record karnaa paigambar kii mrityu ke kuch sadiyon baad aayaa, kyonki haddees vishwasaneey gavaahon kii ek satyapit akhand shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se praarambhik islam ke record

 ebn hisham ne mohammad ke do sau saal baad bhi ebn ishaak ke khoe hue kaam par apni jeevani kii aadhaar par likhaa, jo mohammad kii mrityu ke 72 saal baad paidaa hua tha
 Isha was recorded as twelve at the age of nine in marriage, and by Ibn Khallikan and Ibn Sa'd al-baghdadi, the latter being his source Hisham ibn Urwa

 It often served political purposes, and Aisha's marriage to Muhammad had political connotations
 muslim lekhak jo apni bahan asamaa ke bare main adhik vistrut jaankaree ke aadhaar par aisha kii umr kii gananaa karte hai, unka anumaan he ki vah teraa se adhik thim or shaayad unki shaadi ke samay satraa or unnisvin ke bich thim
 Mohammad Niknam Arbahi, an Iranian Islamic scholar and historian, has considered six different approaches to determining Aisha's age and concludes that she was engaged in her late teens
 ek sandarbh bindu ke rup main fatima kii umr kaa upyog karte hue, lahore ahmadiya andolan vidwaan mohammad ali ne anumaan lagaaya he ki shaadi ke samay aisha das saal se adhik puraani thi or iske samaapan ke samay pandrah varsh se adhik thi
 American historian Dennis Spellberg has reviewed Islamic literature on Aisha's virginity, age at marriage, and age when the marriage ended and speculated that Aisha's youth exaggerated to leave no doubt about her virginity
 May have been done
 spelberg kehete hai, "aisha kii umr ebn saad main ek pramukh pre-vyavsaay he jahaan uski shaadi chah se saat ke bich badalati he, nau shaadi kii samaapti par uski umr ke rup main sthir dikhti he
 "she makes an exception in Ibn Hisham's biography of the Prophet, which states that when Esha was 10 years old, her review was summarized with the view that" these specific references to the bride's age include Aisha's pre-
 Menarial status is reinforced and, apparently, their virginity
 ve aitihaasik record main aisha kii umr kii vividhta kaa bhi suzav dete hai

 arthniti ke sandarbh main, sarkaar ke rajasav sangrah tathaa vyay ke samuchit niyaman dwaara arthvyavastha ko vaanchit disha dena rajkoshiya niti kehalaata he
 Therefore, there are two main tools of fiscal policy - change in tax level and structure and change in expenditure by the government in various items
 aisi koi arthvyavastha nahin he jo rajkoshiya niti yaa maudrik niti ke bina chal sakati ho
 But there is a debate as to which policy should play a major role in both for economic management
 sarkari nirmaan pariyojnaon, jam kar tex lagane or aarthik jivan main anya hastkshepon ke zariye maang or rojgaar badhaane ke pakshdhar rajkoshiya nitiyon ke viveksammat istemaal ko aarthik vruddhi kii chaalak shakti maanate hai
 This idea of deficit economy is mainly the result of Keynesian economics

 Prior to the dominance of Keynesian economics, there was a trend of economic management through monetary policy

 He criticized the Keynesian approach
 maudrik niti ke samarthakon kii manyata he ki tex kam lagane chahie or maudrik niti ko sarkaar ke vivek ke bharose chhodane ke bajaay kuch nishchit niyam-kanoonon ke tahat chalaaya janaa chahie
 Only in this way can the economy be better managed and the fiscal deficit kept under control
 arthshaastra kii bhashaa main is vichaar ko maudrikwaad yaa monatorizam kii sangya di jaati he
 Monetary policy is governed mainly by the central bank of the economy
 yah bank tayshuda samshtigat aarthik nitiyon ke tahat sarkaar ke kehane par bhi kadam uthaata he or sarkaar se swatantra nirnay bhi letaa he
 Initially, monetary policy generally operated only on the basis of changes in interest rates and the functioning of the open market
