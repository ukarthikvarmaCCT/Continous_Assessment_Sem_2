 shwasan kii kriya ke pratham charan main shwasan-dravyon main chali jaati he tathaa shesh 96 pratishat urja piruvik amla main sanchit ho jaati he
 In the first five steps of glycolysis, the 6-carbon specific glucose molecule is decomposed into a three-carbon molecule using energy
 crebs chakra oxic shwasan kii duusari avasthaa he
 It occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cell fluid of prokaryotes
 is kriya main glicolisis kaa ant padaarth piruvik amla purna rup se oxykrut hokar carbon dioxide or jal main badal jaataa he tathaa aise anek padaarthon kaa nirmaan hota he jinka upyog anya jaev-rasinic paripathon main amino amla, purine, pirimidin, fatty amla evam glucose aadi ke nirmaan main hota he tathaa adhik maatra main urja mukt hoti he
 This action takes place in several stages and acts as a circle
 is chakra kaa adhyayan sarvapratham hans adolf creb ne kiya tha, unheen ke naam par is kriya ko crebs chakra kehete hai
 The first action of this action is citric acid, so this process is also called citric acid cycle
 citric amla main 3 carboxylic mulak upasthit rahata he atah ise tri carboxylic cycle yaa tisie chakra bhi kehete hai
 In the cyclic reactions of the Krebs cycle, complete oxidation of pyruvic acid gives out one molecule of carbon dioxide at three places throughout the cycle, that is, three carbon atoms of pyruvic acid leave three molecules as carbon dioxide
 shwasan kriya ke creb chakra ke dauraan pyruvik amla oxeloacetic amla se kriya karata he
 It consists of three co-enzymes
 sarvapratham piruvik amla injim kii upasthiti main oxykrut hokar carbon dioxide tathaa hydrogen main badal jaataa he
 The hydrogen dioxide receptor combines with NAD to form NADH 2 and the carbon dioxide gas is released into the atmosphere
 enediech tu main upasthit hydrogen kai shwasan injimon kii usthiti main oxygen se milakar jal main badal jaataa he tathaa urja mukt hoti he
 This energy is combined with ADP and stored as ATP
 ek anu glucose ke purna rup se oxikaran ke falswaroop 38 anu atipi kaa nirmaan hota he
 ATP is a repository of energy, also called energy currency
 atipi main sanchit urja jeevon ke aavashyaktaanusaar vighatit hokar urja mukt hoti he jisamen jeevon kii vibhinn jaivik kriyaayein sanchalit hoti he
 Oxidative respiration does not require oxygen and it occurs in the absence of oxygen
 is kriya main bhojan kaa apurna oxikaran hota he
 Carbon dioxide and lactic acid are formed as a result of this action in animals and in plants carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol are formed and a very small amount of energy is released
 is prakaar kaa shwasan kuch nimna shrenee ke paudhon, yeast, jeevanu, evam antah paraseete jantuon jaise golkrimi, feetakrimi, monocystis ityadi main hota he
 Under certain circumstances, high-grade animals, plant tissues, seeds, juicy fruits, etc
 also occur in the absence of oxygen
 manushyon yaa ucch shrenee ke jeevon kii mansapeshiyon ke thakne kii avasthaa main yah shwasan hota he
 The organisms that have this respiration are called Nairobes
 oxic shwasan ke samaan hi anaksi shwasan ke prarambh main glicolisis kii kriya hoti he jiske ant main piruvik amla banataa he
 In the further process, there is no complete oxidation of pyruvic acid due to lack of oxygen, so this respiration produces much less energy than oxygen respiration
 paudhon main yah piruvik amla carboxillej injim kii upasthiti main acitaldihide or carbon daai oxide main badal jaati he
 This is then degraded by NADH2 in the presence of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, and is converted to NAD and ethyl alcohol
 praaniyon kii peshiyon tathaa kuch jeevanuon main oxygen kii anupasthiti main glicolisi ke ant main nirmit piruvik amla NADH2 kii sahaayta se lactic amla main badal jaataa he
 Fermentation is a specific chemical action of anoxic respiration
 isamen sookshm jeevon tathaa injimon kii upasthiti main jatil carbonic yogicon kaa vighatan saral yogicon ke rup main hota he
 Fermentation occurs in yeast, lactobacillus and sprouted seeds
 kinvan kii kriya ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- alcoholic kinvan tathaa amleey kinnav
 In the process of alcoholic fermentation, glucose is dissolved in ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide and some energy is released
 yah east tathaa ankurit beej aadi main hoti he
 gimase is an enzyme produced by Ist
 amleey kinvan jeevanu evam mansapeshiyon main hoti he
 Acids are formed in it
 iskaa aarthik mahatva bhi he
 With its help, alcohol, vinegar, curd etc
 are produced and chemical materials are produced in the craft industry
 shwasan kii kriya main carbon daai-oxide kaa vah aaytan jo baahar nikalataa he tathaa jitna aaytan oxigen kaa avasorana hota he uske anupaat ko shwasan bhagfal kehete hai
 It is always represented in numbers such as - 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1 Respiratory quotient indicates which type of food is being oxidized in respiration, as this ratio is different in different foods
 shwasan kii kriya main upyog main aane vaale khadyapadaarthon ke aadhaar par iskaa maan ikai, ikai se kam, ikai se adhik hota he
 When the food substance that is oxidized to respiration is carbohydrate, then the value of the respiratory quotient is unit, such as in seeds of germinated wheat
 jab shwasan main upyog hone vaala khadyapadaarth vasa yaa protein ho tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai se kam hota he
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + Energy shwasan main upyog aane vaala khadyapadaarth jab protein hota he tab shwasan-gunank kaa maan 0
4 se 0
9 tak ho saktaa he
 If we know the value of RQ, then we can guess what kind of food is being reacted in respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main paudhe prakaash kii upasthiti main vaataavaran se carbon daai-oxide ko grahan karte hai tathaa oxigen gas vaataavaran main mukt karte hai
 It is natural to increase the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere and decrease of carbon dioxide, but in reality it is not so
 shwasan kii kriya main sajiv din or raat har samay oxigen gas grahan karte hai tathaa carbon daai-oxide gas kaa vaataavaran main tyaag karte hai
 In this way, the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere is maintained by respiration
 shwasan ek urja-unmochan prakriya he
 In respiration, food is oxidized, releasing the accumulated energy
 shwasan ke samay mukt urja kaa kuch bhaag koshika ke mitocondria main atipi ke rup main sanchit ho jaati he
 This energy, accumulated in the form of ATP, is used to carry out various biological functions of living organisms in future
 mukt honi vaali ooshmiya urja sajivon ke sharir ke tapakram ko santulit banaae rakhane main sahaayta karti he
 Light is produced from the bodies of some insects and sea animals
 yah prakaash shwasan dwaara utpann urja kaa hi ek roopaantarit rup he
 The body of some marine organisms such as electric ray fish and torpedoes, etc
 generates electric waves for self-defense, it is produced by the conversion of energy generated by electric respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon d-oxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbon daai-oxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials
 sajivon ke sharir main prayek koshika main jaev-rasinic kriyaayein hoti rahati hai
 Daily energy is required to perform these actions
 urja kaa mukhya strot bhojan he
 Solar energy is stored as potential energy in food
 shwasan kriya main shwasan kaa mukhya padaarth glucose kaa oxigen kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti main purna yaa apurna oxikaran hota he, jiske falswaroop bhojan main sanchit sthitij urja gatij urja ke rup main mukt hota he, jisase jivan kii dainik kriyaaon ke sampaadan hetu aavashyak urja kaa unmochan tathaa purti hoti he
 The glucose required for oxidation in respiration is produced between nutrition
 poshan ke liye aavashyak urja, shwasan kriya main utpann urja se praapt hoti he
 In this way, respiration and nutrition are inextricably related to each other
 koshikeey shwasan ke dwaara atipi nirmaan ke liye adhikansh sajiv shwasan kii vaatapekshi vidhi par nirbhar hai parantu kram-vikaas ke dauraan pehle vatanirpekshi shwasan kaa vikaas hua tha
 The absence of oxygen gas in the Earth's atmosphere was one of the first evolving atmospheric respiration
 4
6 billian varsh pehle prithvi ke vayumandal main mukhya gaisen carbon daai-oxide, nitrogen, jal vaashp evam hydrogen sulphide thim
 It was in this environment that the first unicellular organism originated 3
5 billion years ago
 ye prokariots the
 Their cellular structure was very simple
 chunki vaataavaran main swatantra oxygen nahin tha isliye in sajivon main shwasan kii vatanirpekshi prakriya kaa vikaas hua jiske liye oxygen kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati he
 After this, these prokaryotes ruled the earth for about 1 billion years
 inamen apana bhojan swayan banane ke liye prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya hoti thi
 In the process of photosynthesis, carbohydrates are formed with the help of carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and oxygen gas is released
 is mukt hue oxygen kaa pariman dhire-dhire vaataavaran main badhane laga
 In the presence of oxygen, a new method of respiration developed in living cells that could produce more ATP
 is vidhi ke dwaara koshikaaye pehle se adhik urja utpann karne lageen
 This led to their increasing size and the evolution of complex eukaryotic organisms from simple prokaryotes
 inhen eukariotic jeevon se vartmaan samay ke shaiwal, kavak, padap evam jantuon kaa vikaas hua he jinamein koshikeey shwasan atyant viksit he
 If bio-evolution of cellular respiration had not happened, perhaps even today, ancient prokaryotic organisms would have ruled the earth
 prastut sarini main koshikeey shwasan kii puri kriyavidhi kaa sankshep main vivaran he
 The description of how much ATP is being produced by using the energy generated in each phase shows the importance of the reaction
 2 ATP4 ADP2 NAD2 Pi 2 ADP4 ATP2 NADH2 h + 2 NADH2 H+ 2 CO22 NAD 4 ADP4 Pi2 ATP 2 CO24 ATP2 ADP 2 ATP4 ADP2 NAD2 Pi 2 ADP4 ATP2 NADH2 h + 2 coa-s-h2 NAD 2 CO22 NADH2 h + 6 H2O2 ADP2 Pi6 NAD2 FAD 4 CO22 ATP6 NADH6 h + 2 FADH2 10 NADH10 H+2 FADH2 10 NAD12 h + 2 FAD 34 ADP34 Pi 34 ATP 2 FADH2 se 4 atipi 3 O26 H2O40 ADP40 Pi2 ATP 6 H2O40 ATP2 ADP a computer file is a class of information collected, or a resource for storing information that is available to a computer program, and is usually based on some kind of durable computer storage
 sanchika tikaoo is lihaaz se hoti he ki yah maujuuda kaarykram ke samaapt hone ke baad bhi anya kaaryakramon dwaara istemaal ke liye maujuud rahati he
 Computer files can traditionally be considered the modern form of paper documents contained in files from offices and libraries, which is why the file is named in English
 nunatam str par kai aadhunik prachaalan pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko keval ek-aiami biton kii shrunkhlaa hi maanati hai
 At a more high level, when the contents of the file are also kept in view, these binomial digits may be considered representing integers, letters, image pixels, sounds, or anything else
 yah sanchika kaa istemaal karne vaale kaarykram par nirbhar he ki vah kis prakaar sanchika kaa arth nikaalata he or jaankaree ke aantarik jamaav ko kaise samajhataa he, taaki prayokta ko or adhik myne rakhane vaali style main isi jaankaree ko prastut kar sake 
 At any given time, the file will have a shape, usually expressed in bytes, and indicate how much space the file has in store
 adhiktar aadhunik prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah aakaar koi bhi arunatmak purnank ho saktaa he, lekin pranali ke anusaar isaki adhiktam seemaa hogi
 But the simple definition of a file does not preclude that its current size has any real meaning, except in the case when the contents of the file are some of the contents within a set of persistent collections
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi unics-samaan pranali main jis sanchika kii ore / bin / ls kii kadi ingit karti he, uskaa aakaar paribhaashit hota he or virale hi badalata he
 Compare this to / dev / null, it is also a file but its size always changes but probably does not matter the same way as in the previous example
 kisi sanganak sanchika main maujuud jaankaree or choti jaankariyon ke pulindon ke rup main ho sakati he yaa chalneey bhi ho sakati he
 It only depends on the creator of the file how the information will be organized in it
 is kaaran se anekon kam maanak vaali sanchika dhaanche maujuud hai jo saralatam se jatiltam tak har prakaar ke makasad ke liye kaam aa sakate hai
 Most computer files are used by computer programs
 ye kaarykram apane istemaal ke liye yathochit sanchikaaye banaate, badalte va mitaate hai
 The program-makers who make these programs decide which files are needed, how they are to be used and their names
 kuch maamalon main sanganak kaarykram sanchikaon main her fer is dhang se karte hai ki ve sanganak prayokta ko dikhti hai
 For example, in the word-processing program, users make changes to document files and the user names them by themselves
 dastauez sanchika kii saamagree is tarah yojit hoti he ki shabd-sansaadhan kaarykram ko vah samaj main aa jaae, lekin prayokta hi uskaa naam va bhandaaran pataa nirdhaarit karata he or bhandaaran kii pramukh jaankaree bhi prayokta hi nirdhaarit karata he
 Many applications push all the content files into a single file and mark them inside to keep track of different types of information
 duum or quek jaise khelon kii saamagree sanchikaaye iskaa ek udhaaharan hai
 On the computer, it is possible to create, modify, extend, shrink, move, and delete files
 adhiktar maamalon main, sanganak kaaryakramon ko sanganak par chalaa kar yah sab kiya jaataa he, par zarurat ho to sanganak kaa prayokta bhi sanchikaon main badlaav kar saktaa he
 For example, Microsoft Word files are usually created by the Microsoft Word program based on user instructions, but the user can also delete, delete, or transfer these files directly through a file manager program such as Windows Explorer
 unics-jaisi pranaaliyon main prayokta-kshetra kii prakriyaayein aamtaur par sidhe sanchikaon se nahin ulajhati hai; prachaalan pranali ek pruthakkaran str pradaan karti he jisaki vajah se prayokta-kshetra kii ore se sanchikaon ke saath kaa lagbhag sara len-dein kathor kadiyon se hota he
 a file can be named by using rigid links; Purely operating systems do not have names of files
 udhaaharan ke liye prayokta-kshetra ke kaarykram kisi sanchika ko mitaa nahin sakate hai, ve keval us sanchika kii kadi ko mitaa sakate hai or yadi ashthi ko yah pataa lagata he ki is sanchika kii ab koi or kadiyaan nahin hai, to vah is sanchika ko mitaa saktaa he
 In fact, only the layer transacts through files, but user-zone requests are done through files in such a way that it remains unknown to user-zone programs
 yun to kaaryakramon kaa sanchikaon ke saath kaa len-dein prachaalan pranali or sanchika pranali ke hisaab se alag alag hota he par mukhyatah yah gatividhiyaan aam hai: In modern computer systems, filenames are commonly used to access files
 kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah naam sanchika se judaa hota he
 In some others, the file itself is anonymous, but named links point to it
 is maamle main prayokta kadi ko hi sanchika kaa naam samaj saktaa he, lekin yah vastav main sahi nahin hoga, khaastaur par jab ek hi sanchika kii ek se adhik kadiyaan hon tab
 The files can be in directories
 lekin behatar yah kahana hoga ki nirdeshika ke andar sanchikaon kii suchi yaa sanchikaon kii kadiyon kii suchi ho sakati he
 Under this definition it is very important to understand that the term "file" also includes directories
 isse nirdeshikaon ke sopan sambhav hote hai, arthath nirdeshikaon ke andar upanirdeshikas
 The name that refers to a file inside a directory must be unique
 lekin kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main naam ke saath prakaar bhi nirdisht hota he jisaki vajah se ek nirdeshika main do alag alag prakaar kii sanchikaayen ek hi naam se sambhav hai jaise ki ek hi naam kii ek nirdeshika va ek sanchika
 In environments in which files are named, the pair of file names and paths must be unique - the names and paths of any two files cannot match the names and paths of any other file
 jahaan sanchika benaam ho, namit sandarbh ek namasthaan ke antargat rahenge
 Most times a name in any namespace will refer to exactly one or zero files
 lekin, koi bhi sanchika kisi namasthaan main shunya, ek yaa adhik naamon se sanderbhit kii ja sakati he
 Depending on the context of the application, the appropriate name for any file or link must be made up of special characters
 sanganak pranali par nirbhar karata he ki yah naam upyukt he yaa nahin
 Early computers allowed a limited number of letters and numbers in a file's name, but modern computers allow long names to contain Unicode characters or Unicode numbers in almost any order, so that the purpose of the file is understood at a glance
 
 kuch sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon main khaali sthaan kii anumati dete hai, kuch nahin
 The ephemeral sensitivity of file names is determined by the file system
 unics sanchika pranaliyaan aamtaur par laghudirghasanvedi hoti hai or prayokta-stareey anuprayogon ko aisi sanchikaaye banane detii hai jinke aksharon main keval laghu or deergh kaa fark ho
 Microsoft Windows offers several file systems, with different policies for short-term sensitivity
 yadi prayokta nirdeshika pravishtion main sanchika naamon ko badalane ke liye discs sampadak kaa istemaal kare to prachlit effeti pranali main kai sanchikaaye ho sakati hai jinke naam main keval deergh-laghu aksharon kaa hi fark ho
 However, user applications generally do not allow this
 adhiktar sanganak, sanchikaon ko sopan ke aadhaar par yojit karte hai or iske liye folder, nirdeshika yaa kaitlog kaa istemaal karte hai
 Whatever the word, the idea is the same
 har folder main kuch sankhya main sanchikaaye ho sakati hai or unamem anya folder ho sakate hai
 These other folders are called subfolders
 inamen or sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai, aadi-aadi, aise kar ke ek vriksh-rupi dhaanchaa nirmit hota he jisamen ek "guru folder" yaa hota he jiske adheen kitne bhi str tak sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai
 Folders can also have names like files
 folderon ke jariye sanchikaon ko taarkik tareeke se yojit karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 Whenever a computer uses folders, each file and folder has not only its own name but also a path that indicates which folder or folders the file or folder is present in
 is path main ek vishesh chihn - jaise ki / - ko jariye sanchika yaa folder naamon ke bich main likhaa jaataa he
 For example in the example in this article, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers indicates that a file named Managers is in a folder called Salaries, and this folder is in Payroll
 sanchika or folder ke naamon ke bich main aage jhuki lakeer he, sarvocch yaa jad folder kaa koi naam nahin he, atah naam aage jhuki lakeer se shuru hota he 
 Many computer systems use extensions in file names, also called file types
 windos sanganakon main vistaar sanchika ke naam ke baad ek bindu or bindu ke aage kuch akshar kaa rup letaa he, ye akshar sanchika ke prakaar kii pahchaan hote hai
 The 
txt extension is the identity of the text file, the 
doc extension is the identity of a document, especially in Microsoft Word file format; Etc
 etc
 sanganak pranali par vistaaron kaa istemaal hone par bhi, sanganak pranali unhen kis had tak pahachaanata he or kis had tak unke anusaar vyavhaar karata he, isamen bhi kaafii vividhta he, kuch pranaaliyon main ye anivaary hai, jabaki kuch or main inke maujuud hone se bhi koi fark nahin padataa, ye nazarandaz kar die jate hai
 Many modern computer systems provide ways to prevent files from getting damaged
 jo sanganak ek se adhik prayoktaaon kii suvidha dete hai ve sanchika anumatiyaan bhi lagu karte hai jinase yah niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sanchikaaye va folder bana, mitaa yaa badal saktaa he or koun nahin
 For example, a user may have permission to change a file but not delete it, or to create files and folders but not delete it
 anumatiyon ke jariye yah bhi nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he ki keval kuch hi prayokta kisi sanchika yaa folder kii saamagree dekh saken
 Permissions protect against illegal alteration or destruction of content in files and illegal users can be prevented from viewing certain files to keep private information confidential
 kai sanganakon main ek or bachaav vidhi maujuud hoti he jise "keval pathneey chihn" kehete hai
 When this sign is placed, files can be inspected but cannot be changed
 yah chihn vikat jaankaree ke liye laabhadaayak hota he jise badla yaa mitaayaa nahin janaa chahie, jaise ki sanganak pranali ke aantarik purzon dwaara prayukt kuch vishesh sanchikaon ke liye
 Some systems also include a "hidden sign", which ensures that the file becomes invisible
 is chihn ke jariye sanganak pranali aisi zaruri pranali sanchikaon ko chhipaati he, jinhen prayoktaaon dwaara badla nahin janaa chahie
 In the above discussion, the file is described as a concept for a high level operating system or user
 lekin, kisi bhi sanchika ko vastav main kaam laayak hone ke liye bhautik rup se upasthit hona aavashyak he
 That is, the abstract concept of a file needs to be in the actual physical form in the real computer system, otherwise it does not have to exist
 bhautik rup se adhiktar sanganak sanchikaaye kisi prakaar ke saamagree bhandaaran upkaran main rakhi jaati hai
 Examples are hard jisc, through which most operating systems operate
 adhiktar sanchikaaye inhen main rakhi jaati hai
 Hard disks are the most widely available non-volatile storage device in the early 21st century
 yadi sanchikaon main keval asthaayee saamagree hi ho to unhen areem main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In operating systems like Unix, many files are not directly connected to any physical storage device: / dev / null is a prime example of this, likewise almost all of the files contained within / dev, / proc and / sys are of the same type
 
 inkaa prayokta kshetra main sanchikaon kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 But these are virtual files that actually exist only as objects of the operating system's archetype
 sanganak sanchikaon ko chumbakeey pattayon main bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases files can also be stored in other media such as writeable compact discs, digital multivariate disks, zip drives, USB flash drives, etc
 jab sanganak sanchikaon main bahut mahatvapurn jaankaree hote he to pratilipi prakriya ke jariye aisi sthitiyon ko parinaamon se bachane kii koshish kii jaati he jinamein sanchikaaye nasht ho sakati hai
 Copying files simply means keeping the copies of the files in another location so that if something happens to the original computer or they are accidentally erased, they can be returned by copy
 sanchikaon kii prati rakhane ke kai tareeke hai
 Most computer systems provide convenience programs that facilitate the copying process, as it can take a lot of time if many files are to be copied
 sanchikaon ko aksar lekhanyogy sidi yaa cartrij tepon jaise hastantaraneey madhyamon main pratilipit kiya jaataa he
 Copying files to another hard disk of the same computer protects against a malfunction of one disk, but if the entire computer is to be protected against the risk of malfunction or loss, it is necessary to make copies of those files in such medium Which can be taken away from this computer and stored in a safe place
 dada-baap-betaa pratilipi vidhi swachaalit rup se teen pratilipiyaan banaati he, sanchika kii sabase puraani prati dada sanchika hoti he or betaa maujuuda pratilipi
 The system of which files are organized, named, stored and changed by which computer is called its file system
 adhiktar prachaalan pranaaliyon main kam se kam ek sanchika pranali hoti he
 Multiple file systems can be run simultaneously in many operating systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, nae emes windos sanganakon par emes-dos ke puraane effeti-style kii sanchika pranaliyaan samarthit hai or saath hi taaze windos sanskarnon kii prachlit sanchika pranali antiatioes bhi chalati he
 Every system has its advantages and disadvantages
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak effeti main keval 8 akshar ke sanchika naam chalate hai, jabaki antiatioes main lambey sanchika naam sambhav hai jinamein khaali sthaan bhi ho sakate hai
 You can name a file in NTFS like Payroll records but in FAT this name can be something similar to payroll
dat
 sanchika prabandhak kaarykram suvidhadaayak kaarykram hote hai jinke jariye sanchikaon va folderon ko hilaayaa, banaaya, mitaayaa yaa punarnamit kiya ja saktaa he, par ye vastav main aapako sanchika kii saamagree ko padhane yaa saamagree jodne nahin dete hai
 Each computer system provides at least one file manager for its parent file system
 windos main sabase adhik prayukt sanchika prabandhak kaarykram windos explorer he or mike main yah finder he
 Linux has many file managers like Nautilus, Conqueror
 sanchika ke liye prayukt angrezi shabd "fil" kaa sanganak bhandaaran ke sandarbh main prayog 1952 se hi chhidi pattiyon main sanchit jaankaree ke liye shuru ho gaya tha
 In the initial experiment, people used to call the underlying software only file
 udhaaharan ke liye ibiem 350 kii discs drivon ko "discs fil" kaha jaataa tha
 Systems such as the 1962 compatible time sharing system had file systems that displayed multiple "files" on a single cache device, and thus began the modern use of the term
 sitis ke sanchika naamon main do hisse the, ek prayokta-pathneey "pradhan naam" or doosraa "apradhan naam" jo sanchika kaa prakaar bataata tha
 This practice is still practiced by many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows

 jiname se kuch rajyon ne purnatah swadhin hone ke baavjood rajtantr ke prati apni vafadaari ko barqaraar rakhaa, jabaki kuch rajyon ne british rajtantr ko nammaatr pramukh maanane se inkaar kar swayan ko ganatantric rajya ghoshit kar diya
 Today, there are a total of 16 states in the world outside which identify themselves as a homeland of Queen Elizabeth II
 angrezi bhashaa main british samprabhu ke adheen in rajyon ko aam taur par riyalm ke naam se janaa jaataa he, joki francisi shabd royum se liya gaya he, realm yani ek aisa rajya, kshetra yaa pradesh, jisapar ek raja / rani raaj karti he
 It is necessary to know here that "realm" is not a legal or legal term in the official terminology of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or any Commonwealth Territory, that is, there is no legal definition of "realm"
 atah aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he kii british samprabhu ke adheen aanevaale in rajyon ko kisi vishesh naam se sambodhit kiya jaae, naahin "realm" shabd, ek rajya ke kisi vishesh darje ko paribhaashit karata he
 However, since the 1950s, the term "realm" has been used in authoritative documents to distinguish states under the British sovereign's rule from other member states of the Commonwealth, even the Queen Elizabeth's coronation This word was also used in the declaration of
 in rajyon ko realm isiilie kaha jaataa he, kyonki ek hi shaasha kii adheen hone ke baavjood ye saare rajya, purnatah saarvbhaumik hai, or ek-dusre se purnah swatantra hai, atah yah 16 desh, ek rajnatik ikai kaa hissaa nahin he, balki 16 alag-alag rajya hai
 Because realm is not a legal word, therefore no official translation of it is also present
 atah in pradeshon kaa bodh karne hetu, kisi raja ke adheen bhoomi kaa bodh karaane vaale kisi bhi shabd kaa upyog kiya jaasakata he
 Ordinarily, words like prajbhoomi, pradesh, and paribhumi are used, besides these, the terms mandal and rajbhumi can also be used

 This thinking was developed during the feudalistic period in the Kingdom of England to address literal crowns and national estates by dividing them from the sovereign and his / her personal property
 is soch ke anusaar rajmukut ko prashasan ke samast angon tathaa har aayam main rajya tathaa shashan ke pratik ke rup main dekha jaataa he, tathaa british samprabhu ko rajmukut ke satat avatar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, in Britain and the Commonwealth territories, this terminology is also used as an epithet for governance or government, or it may be said directly that this is another way of addressing the monarchy itself
 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he
 Therefore, in this context the word should not be confused with the actual crown of any royal dress
 ek santhaan ke rup main, rajmukut, britain kii raajnneetikvyavastha kaa sabase purana kaaryshil santhaan he
 The concept of Rajmukut in each Commonwealth region is the same, but divided legal concepts

" yaa '"la Couronne du chef du Québec" iske alaava The Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, ityadi, or kyonki, canda or australia sangheey raashtra hai, atah prayek canadian praant or australian rajya "par adhikaar dhari rajmukut" bhi hai
 The rights of the crown are exercised either by the superintendent himself or by his representative, on the advice of the ministers or officials concerned

 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 uttaradhikaar sambandhit niyam keval sansadeey adhinium dwaara parivartit kiye ja sakate hai, singhasana kaa koi uttaradhikari, swechha se apana uttaradhikaar tyaag nahin kar saktaa he
 After sitting on the throne, a person rules till his death
 itihaas main ekmaatr swachhik padatyag, 1936 main edward ashtum ne kiya tha, jise sansad ke vishesh adhinium dwaara vaid qaraara gaya tha
 The last time a ruler was involuntarily expelled was James VII and II in 1688 who were expelled at the time of the Glorious Revolution
 act of setlement, 1701, uttaradhikaar ko sofia of hanover, james pratham kii ek potee, ke vaidhik protestant vanshajon tak simit karata he
 Therefore, no Catholic member of the royal family can ever authorize the throne
 ek shaasi shaasha ke nidhan par swayamev hi, rajpth, uske asann vaaris ke paas chalaa jaataa he, atah saidhantik rup se, singhasana ek kshan ke liye bhi khali nahin rahata he
 And the succession is publicly declared by the succession council
 atah angreji parampara ke anusaar shaasha ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid hone ke liye rajbhishek hona aavashyak nahin he
 So the coronation is usually a few months after the succession
 nae shaasha ke rajbhishek kii parampara westminster aibe main cantarbari ke archbishap dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 atah uttaradhikari ke ling tathaa dharm kaa uttaradhikaar par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he
 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories
 1701 ke act of setlement ke vidhaanon ke anusaar, james pratham kii potee, hanover kii electress, sofia, ke "vaid" protostant vanshaj hi singhasana ko uttaradhikrut karne ke liye sakasham hai
 That is, only legitimate children of the royal family's dynasty hold succession over Singhasan, and none of the illegitimate children, and their descendants, have any right over Singhasan
 is sandarbh main, royal marejez act, 1772 ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar shahi parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ko vivaah karne hetu samprabhu kii sweekruti lenaa aavashyak he, or samprabhu ke sweekruti ke bina kiye gaye kisi bhi vivaah ko "avaidh" qaraar diya jayega, tathaa vah vyakti or uske santan singhasana par adhikaar se vanchit ho jaayenge
 Some changes were made to the provisions of this Act by the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act
 is adhinium ke anusaar, uttaradhikaar kram ke pehle chah sadasyon ko vivaah karne hetu samprabhi kii ijazat lenaa aavashyak he, anyathaa us vyakti tathaa us vivaah se hue saare santan or unke vanshajon ko uttaradhikaar kram se vanchit maan liya jayega
 But any such marriage cannot be declared illegal in any way
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 baharhaal, aam taur par un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 The royal family, based on this criteria, included Adhirat, his / her companions, the widow / widower of the former sovereign, the offspring of the eldest son of the prince of Wales, and the siblings or widows of the sons of the former ruler and grandson of his male line
 Will be vibhinn rashtramandal pradeshon ke sandarbh main, isi vishesh samooh ke liye bhinn shabdaawalee kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he, udhaaharan ke taur par, australia main is samooh ko australian rajpariwaar or canda main canadian rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he

 jinamein se adhiktar deshon ne madhya 20veen sadi tak britain se swatantraaa hasil kar lee
 Although all those countries rejected the suzerainty of the government of the United Kingdom, many of them recognized the British ruler as their suzerainty
 in deshon ko rashtramandal pradesh yaa rashtramandal prajabhumi kaha jaataa he
 At present, the United Kingdom is not only the United Kingdom, but in addition there are a total of 15 other nations
 haalanki in rashtron main bhi unhen lagbhag saamaan pad va adhikaar praapt he jaisaa kii britain main, parantu un deshon main, unka koi vaastavik raajnneetik yaa paaramparik karttavya nahin he, shaasha ke lagbhag saare karttavya unke pratnidhi ke rup main us desh ke maharajyapal puraa karte hai
 The Government of Britain has no role or interference in the work of the governments of the Commonwealth territories
