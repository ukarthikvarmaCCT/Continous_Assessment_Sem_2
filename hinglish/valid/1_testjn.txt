 In modern wingsuit designs, the superficially shaped part is made from cloth between the legs and under the arms
 wingsut ko bardman suut yaa squiral suut bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 The wingsuit ends with the opening of the flying parachute, so the wing suit can be flown from any location that provides sufficient height to engage in air, such as aircraft flying in the air or base jumping exit points
 , As well as it allows parachutes to be used
 wingsut udaaka skydiving yaa base jamping ke liye dizin kiya gaya parachute upkaran pahentaa he
 The flier uses the parasute at a well-planned height and opens the wings of the arm when necessary, so that it can reach the control toggle and fly to the level of a normal parachute landing

 a wingsuit flier changes its body shape to create a desired amount of flight and stretch although most wing suits have a ratio of 2
5 to 1
 iskaa matlab yah he ki aage badhate hue prayek foot kii giravat se dhaai feet kii badhat hoti he
 By manipulating the body shape and choosing the design features of the wingsuit, a flier can change both its speed of movement and the rate of fall
 payalat apane dhad ke aakaar ko badalakar, chaap kaa aakaar banaakar yaa apane kandhon, kulhon or ghutanon ko modakar or us akraman ke kone ko badalakar jisamen wingsut saapeksh hawa main udaan bharta he or suut ke kapadon ke pankhons par prayog kii gayi tanyata kii maatra ko badalakar udaan kii in visheshtaon main herpher kar saktaa he
 The absence of a vertically stabilizing surface results in a slight damping around the deviation axis, therefore the technique of weak flight produces a movement that requires an active effort to stop the skydiver's side
 wingsut udaake un freefal computaron ke upyog se apane lakshyon ke saapeksh apni kshamta ko maap sakate hai jo yah bataata he ki kitni der tak vah vimaan main tha, kis oonchai par unhone apane parachute kaa prayog kiya or kis oonchai par unhone freefal main pravesh kiya
 The rate of decline can be calculated by comparing the speed and this figure with previous flights
 suut ke udaan maarg kaa pataa lagane or darj karne ke liye jeepies resiwaron kaa bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he or vishleshan karne par isse udaan ke dauraan udne kii duuri kii maatra kaa bhi pataa chal saktaa he
 Base jumper can also use landmarks at exit points, as well as video recorded by ground crew to determine their capacity relative to previous flights and flights to other base jumper at the same location
 beli se prithvi ke abhivinyas tak ek aam skydiver kaa terminal veg 110 se 140 mile prati ghanta ke daayre main hota he
 a wingsuit can reduce this speed dramatically
 ek taatkaalik veg -25 mile prati ghanta kaa darj kiya gaya he
 The tri-wing wingsuit has three separate ram-air wings attached under the arms and between the legs
 mono-wing wingsut dizin main puri suut ek vishaal wing main shaamil rahati he
 Another variation is the so-called wingpack that is being focused on, consisting of a strap-on rigid wing in carbon fiber
 yah ek hang-glyder or ek wingsut ke bich kaa ek mishran he
 The wingpack can reach a glide-ratio of 6 and allows the transport of oxygen bottles and other materials

 kai vidwaanon ne use magadh kaa hi mul nivasee mana he
 Some Buddhist literature describes him as a resident of Taxila
 kautilya ke janmasthan ke sambandh main atyadhik matbhed rahane ke kaaran nishchit rup se yah kahana ki uskaa janm sthaan kahan tha, kathin he, parantu kai sandarbhon ke aadhaar par takshashila ko uskaa janm sthaan maananaa thik hoga
 Vk Subramaniam has said that in many contexts it is mentioned that Alexander had met the young Kautilya in his campaign of attack
 chunki alexander kaa akraman adhiktar takshashila kshetra main hua tha, isliye yah ummid kii jaati he ki kautilya kaa janm sthaan takshashila kshetra main hi rahaa hoga
 Kautilya's father's name was Chanak
 vah ek garib brahman tha or kisi tarah apana guzar-basar karata tha
 Therefore, it is clear that Kautilya's childhood must have gone through poverty and problems
 kautilya kii shiksha-diksha ke sambandh main kahin kuch vishesh zikr nahin miltaa he, parantu uski buddhi kaa prakharata or uski vidwata uske vichaaron se parilakshith hoti he
 Despite being ugly, he was physically strong
 uski pustak 'arthshaastra' ke avlokan se uski pratibha, uske bahuaiami vyaktitv or doordarshita kaa purna abhas hota he
 It is said about Kautilya that he was a man of very self-respect and temper
 ek kinvadanti ke anusaar ek baar magadh ke raja mahanand ne shraadh ke avasar par kautilya ko apamaanit kiya tha
 Kautilya, under the influence of anger, opened his crest and vowed that he would not tie his crest till he destroyed the Nandavansh
 kautilya ke vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa yah bhi ek bada kaaran tha
 After the destruction of Nanda Dynasty, he gave all possible help to Chandragupta Maurya to sit on the throne
 chandragupta maury dwaara gaddi par asin hone ke baad use parakramee banane or maury samrajya kaa vistaar karne ke uddeshy se usne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 He also became the minister of Chandragupta Maurya
 kai vidwaanon ne yah kaha he ki kautilya ne kahin bhi apni rachana main mauryvansh yaa apane mantritv ke sambandh main kuch nahin kaha he, parantu adhikansh sroton ne is tathy kii sampushti kii he
 The vigorous king whom Kautilya portrays in 'arthashastra' is certainly addressed to Chandragupta Maurya
 bharat par sikandar ke akraman ke kaaran chote-chote rajyon kii paraajay se abhibhoot hokar kautilya ne vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa sankalp kiya
 His paramount desire was to see India as a glorious and vast state
 nishchit rup se chandragupta maury uski ichha kaa kendra bindu tha
 Acharya Kautilya is considered as the founder and patron of the Mauryan Empire on the one hand as a well-known and visionary politician, on the other hand he has the distinction of being the only scholar of his subject due to his incomparable and wonderful work in the history of culture literature
 kautilya kii vidwata, nipunata or doordarshita kaa bakhaan bharat ke shastron, kaavyon tathaa anya granthon main parivyapt he
 The story related to the destruction of the Nanda dynasty by Kautilya and the establishment of the Maurya dynasty comes in the Vishnu Purana
 ati vidwaan or maury samrajya kaa mahaamantri hone ke baavjood kautilya kaa jivan saadagi kaa jivan tha
 He was the true symbol of 'plain Life High Thought'
 usne apane mantritvakaal main atyadhik saadagi kaa jivan bitaayaa
 He used to live in a small house and it is said that the walls of his house were covered with dung cakes
 uski manyata thi ki raja yaa mantri apane charitra or unche aadarshon ke dwaara logon ke saamne ek pratimaan de saktaa he
 He always followed the limits and lived a life of diligence
 kaha jaataa he ki baad main usne mantri pad tyagkar vanprastha jivan vyateet kiya tha
 In fact, he had no desire for money, fame and status
 saratatv main vah ek 'vitaragi', 'tapasvi, karmath or maryaadaaon kaa paalan karanevaala vyakti tha, jiskaa jivan aaj bhi anukaraniya he
 Kautilya is well known as a scholar and a serious thinker, he has also gained fame as a practical and clever politician
 nandavansh ke vinaash tathaa magadh samrajya kii sthapana evam vistaar main uskaa aitihaasik yogadan he
 According to Salatore's statement, Kautilya occupies a paramount place in ancient Indian political thought
 maikiyaveli kii bhanti kautilya ne bhi raajnneeti ko naitikta se pruthak kar ek swatantra shaastra ke rup main adhyayan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 As it goes kautilya kaa naam, janmatithi or janmasthan teenon hi vivaad ke vishay rahe hai
 There are differences among scholars regarding the name of Kautilya
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke pratham anuvadak pandit shaamasasthri ne kautilya naam kaa prayog kiya he
 To prove the authenticity of the name 'kautilya', Pandit Shamashastri has cited vishnu-purana which states- is sambandh main ek vivaad or utpann hua he or vah he kautilya or kautaly kaa
 Ganapathi Shastri has considered 'kautalya' more authentic than 'kautilya'
 unke anusaar kutal gotra hone ke kaaran kautaly naam sahi or sangat prathit hota he
 It has been said under functional ethics - sambashiv shastri ne kaha he ki ganapatishastri ne sambhawatah kautilya ko pracheen sant kutal kaa vanshaj maanakar kautaly naam kaa prayog kiya he, parantu is baat kaa kahin koi pramaan nahin miltaa he ki kautilya sant kutal ke vansh or gotra kaa tha
 The controversy of the names 'kautilya' and 'kautalya' has been raised by many scholars
 ve
 e
 ramasvami ne ganapatishastri ke kathan kaa samarthan kiya he
 Modern scholars have used both names
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautaly or kautilya naam ke vivaad ko adhik mahatva nahin diya he
 According to them, this kind of confusion can be due to the manipulation of the SIC
 adhikansh paashchaatya lekhakon ne kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Scholars in India have used both names, but mostly Kautilya
 is sambandh main radhakant kaa kathan bhi vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 He has said in his composition 'shabdakalpadram' kautilya ke or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 In which the name Chanakya is famous
 kautilya ko chanakya ke naam se pukararane vaale kai vidwaanon kaa mat he ki chaanak kaa putr hone ke kaaran yah chanakya kahalaaya
 On the other hand, according to the legend of some scholars, he was born in Chanak region of Punjab, hence he has been called Chanakya, although no clear evidence is found in this regard
 ek baat spasht he ki kautilya or chanakya ek hi vyakti he
 Apart from the above names, many other names are mentioned, such as Vishnugupta
 kaha jaataa he ki uskaa mul naam vishnugupt hi tha
 His father named him Vishnugupta
 kautilya, chanakya or vishnugupt teenon naamon se sambandhit kai sandarbh milte hai, kintu in teenon naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jaise vatsyayan, malang, dravimal, angul, varanak, katyan ityadi in bhinn-bhinn naamon main koun sa sahi naam he or koun-sa galat naam he, yah vivaad kaa vishay he
 But most Western and Indian scholars have used the name Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra'
 kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon ne kautilya ke astitv par hi prashnvachak chihn laga diya he
 The name Kautilya is symbolic, which is a symbol of diplomacy, according to the opinions of the Victorians, Jolly and Keith
 pantajali dwaara apane mahabhashya main kautilya kaa prasang nahin aane ke kaaran unke maton kaa samarthan mila he
 Jolly has even said that 'arthashastra' is not the work of a person named Kautilya
 yah kisi anya pandit yaa acharya kaa rachit granth he
 Both Shamashastri and Ganapathastri have refuted the views of Western thinkers
 donon kaa yah nishchay mat he ki kautilya kaa purna astitv tha, bhale hi uske naamon main matantar paaya jaataa ho
 In fact, the points raised by these three Western scholars to deny the existence of Kautilya are unrestrained and insignificant
 paashchaatya vidwaanon kaa yah kahana he ki kautilya ne is baat kaa kahin ullekh nahin kiya he ki vah chandragupta maury ke shasankaal main amaatya yaa mantri tha, isliye us 'arthshaastra' kaa lekhan nahin mana ja saktaa he
 This is childish logic
 kautilya ke kai sandarbhon se yah spasht ho chukaa he ki usne chandragupta maury kii sahaayta se nandavansh kaa naash kiya tha or maury samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 Differences are also found among many scholars regarding Kautilya's works
 kautilya kii kitni kritiyaan hai, is sambandh main koi nishchit soochna uplabdh nahin he
 Kautilya's most important work is the discussion of Arthashastra everywhere, but there is no special mention in relation to other works
 chanakya ke shishy kaamandak ne apane 'nitisar' naamak granth main likhaa he ki vishnugupt chanakya ne apane buddhible se arthshaastra rupi mahodadhi ko mathkar nitishastra rupi amrit nikaala
 Chanakya's 'arthashastra' is a unique treatise on the subject of politics in Sanskrit
 iske niti ke shloke to ghar ghar prachlit hai
 From behind, people compiled many ethics from their policy texts, increasing the number of Vriddhachanakya, Minichanakya, Bodhichanakya etc
 chanakya sab vishyon ke pandit the
 He also has an astrological treatise called ‘vishnugupta Siddhant’
 kehete hai, ayurveda par bhi inkaa likhaa 'vaidyajivan' naam kaa ek granth he
 Justice commentators consider Vatsyayan and Chanakya to be one, but this confusion is the origin of this verse of Hemchand: yon dhaatukautilya or raajnneeti naamak rachanaaon ke saath kautilya kaa naam joda gaya he
 Some scholars believe that in addition to 'arthashastra', if other works of Kautilya are mentioned, it may be a compilation of Kautilya's sayings and statements
 rajya kii utpatti ke sandarbh main kautilya ne spasht rup se kuch nahin kaha kintu kuch sanyogvash kii gai tippaniyon se spasht hota he ki vah rajya ke daivi siddhant ke sthaan par saamaajik samjhaute kaa pakshdhar tha
 Like Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, he calls the natural condition of the state before its anarchy
 rajya kii utpatti tab hui jab 'matsay nyaay' ke kanoon se tang aakar logon ne manu ko apana raja chunaa tathaa apni krishi upaj kaa chatha bhaag tathaa swarna kaa dasva bhaag use dena sweekaar kiya
 In return, the king took responsibility for their safety and welfare
 kautilya rajtantr kaa pakshdhar he
 Kautilya has discussed seven elements of the state by not giving details of the four essential elements of the state - land, population, government and sovereignty, propounded by Western political thinkers
 is sambandh main vah rajya kii paribhaasha nahin detaa kintu pehle se chale aa rahe saptang siddhant kaa samarthan karata he
 Kautilya has compared the state to the human body and has accepted its form
 rajya ke sabhi tatva maanav sharir ke ango ke samaan paraspar sambandhit, antanirbhar tathaa mil-julkar kaary karte hai- Population includes farmers, entrepreneurs and subjects contributing to economic production
 praja ko swamibhakt, parishramee tathaa raja kii ajna kaa paalan karne vaala hona chahie
 In this way, Kautilya's Weekend Principle highlights the important role of all the organs while representing the invariable form of the state
 yadhyapi yah siddhant rajya kii aadhunik paribhaasha se mail nahin khaataa, kintu kautilya ke rajya main aadhunik rajya ke chaaron tatva vidyaman hai
 District is land and population, amatya is the feeling of government and Swami is the symbol of sovereignty
 kosh kaa mahatva rajprabandh, vikaas va sanvardhan main he tathaa sena aantarik shaanti vyavastha tathaa bahari suraksha ke liye aavashyak he
 Friend plays an important role in foreign affairs, but the fortification has been replaced by other tools of defense and defense in the modern era
 pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan kaa anukaran karte hue kautilya ne bhi rajtantr kii sankalpana ko apane chintan kaa kendra banaaya he
 He considers the power of the king to be paramount in temporal matters, but in matters of duties, he himself is bound in religion
 vah dharm kaa vyaakhyaata nahin, balki rakshak he
 Kautilya, considering the state as practicable in itself, has given it the highest position in social life
 rajya kaa hit sarvopari he jiske liye kai baar vah naitikta ke siddhanto ko bhi pare rakh detaa he
 According to Kautilya, the aim of the state is not just to establish peace and order, but to contribute to the supreme development of the person
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya ke kaary hai- The king's tasks are to protect the state from external enemies and invaders, to protect the internal system of justice and to protect the people from divine calamities - floods, earthquakes, famines, fires, epidemics, deadly animals
 swadharm ke antargat varnashram dharm par bal diya gaya he
 Although Kautilya does not subject the state to religion as Manu like religion, but the king preserves religion if the subjects are not followed by religion
 raja kaa karttavya sarsaadhaaran ke liye saamaajik nyaay kii sthapana karnaa he
 Proper functioning of the social system is possible only when father-son, husband-wife, guru-disciple etc
 fulfill their responsibilities
 vivaah-viched kii sthiti main vah stri-purush ke samaan adhikaron par bal detaa he
 Feminine and Brahmin killing is considered a serious crime
 kautilya ke rajya kaa kaary-kshetra atyant vyapak he
 He entrusts the responsibility of multi-faceted development of human beings to the state and makes it a welfare state of the modern era
 usne rajya ko anek kaary saunpe hai
 Such as construction of dams, ponds and other means of irrigation, development of mines, plowing of wastelands, animal husbandry, forest development etc
 inke alaava saarvajanik manoranjan rajya ke niyantran main tha
 The orphans, the poor, the help of the handicapped, the protection of female dignity, the system of remarriage etc
 were also the responsibility of the state
 is prakaar kautilya kaa rajya sarvavyaapak rajya he
 Its goal is to establish public welfare and good administration, in which religion and morality are used as an instrument
 kautilya kaa kahana he, At another place he wrote
 is sambandh main salattore kaa kathan he, ‘‘jis rajya ke paas satta tathaa adhikaar he, uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy apni praja kii prasannataa main vruddhi karnaa he
 Thus Kautilya has appropriately directed the actions of a welfare state
 ’’ Kautilya has discussed not only the internal work of the state, but also the external functions in detail
 is sambandh main vah videsh niti, anterrashtriya sambandhon tathaa yuddh va shaanti ke niyamon kaa vivechan karata he
 In order to analyze the relationship of diplomacy, he has given the board theory- kautilya ne apane mandal siddhant main vibhinn rajyon dwaara duusare rajyon ke prati apanaai niti kaa varnan kiya
 In ancient times, many small states existed in India
 shaktishaalee raja yuddh dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karte the
 States often compromised in other states in terms of security
 kautilya ke anusaar yuddh va vijay dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karne vaale raja ko apane shatruon kii apekshaakrit mitron kii sankhya badhaani chahie, taaki shatruon par niyantran rakhaa ja sake
 On the other hand, weak states should be vigilant against powerful neighboring states
 unhen samaan str vaale rajyon ke saath milakar shaktishaalee rajyon kii vistaar-niti se bachane hetu ek gut yaa ‘mandal’ bananaa chahie
 Kautilya's Mandal theory shows on the basis of geography how the neighboring countries of the state desiring victory can be its friends or enemies
 is siddhant ke anusaar mandal ke kendra main ek aisa raja hota he, jo anya rajyon ko jeetne kaa icchhuk he, ise ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ kaha jaataa he
 The first state to come in the path of "vijigishu" is "ari" and the state adjoining the enemy is "enemy of enemy", hence he is friend of Vijigishu
 kautilya ne ‘‘madhyam’’ va ‘‘udasin’’ rajyon kaa bhi varnan kiya he, jo samarthy hote hue bhi ranneeti main bhaag nahin lete
 This theory of Kautilya is based on realism, which emphasizes making the balance of power through treaties and agreements, considering wars as the reality of international relations
 kautilya ne videsh sambandhon ke sanchaalan hetu chah prakaar kii nitiyon kaa vivaran diya he- According to Kautilya, these policies should be used by the king only for the welfare of the state
 kautilya ne rajya kii videsh niti ke sandarbh main kootneeti ke chaar siddhanton sam, daam, dand tathaa bhed kaa varnan kiya
 According to Kautilya, the first two principles should be used by weak kings and the last two principles should be used by strong kings, but it is also of the opinion that the value is equal, the price is different and the punishment is better than punishment
 dand kaa prayog antim upaay ke rup main kiya jaae, kyonki isse swayan kii bhi kshati hoti he
 Kautilya has described in detail the types and functions of detectives
 guptchar vidhyaarthee grihapati, tapasvi, vyapaaree tathaa vish -kanyaon ke rup main ho sakate the
 The ambassadors also played the role of undercover
 inkaa kaary desh-videsh kii gupt suchnaayen raja tak pahunchaana hota tha
 They contributed to assess the state of public opinion, control the rebels and destroy the enemy state
 kautilya ne guptcharon ko raja dwaara dhan va maan dekar santusht rakhane kaa suzav diya he
 The thoughts of great men have a great influence in the life of people
 chanakya ke vichaaro ne bhi kai logo ke jivan ko unnat kiya he
 Many books have been written about Chanakya's diplomacy and its principles
 chanakya ke jivan ko padhanevaala or iskaa anusaran karanevaala ek bada varg he
 Chanakya's thoughts are called priceless
 chanakya ke vichaar adhyaaapak, raajnneetijna or vyavsaayik logo ko kaaphi pasand he
 Reading about the glorious personality of Acharya Chanakya brings new energy
 kautilya ke vichaar aaj bhi preranadai banate he
 It is true that Kautilya has described a vast organization of secret systems to protect the nation
 shatrunash ke liye vishakanya, ganika, aupnishadik prayog, abhichaar mantra aadi aniatik evam anuchit upayon kaa vidhaan he or is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye mahaan dhan-vyay tathaa dhan-kshay ko bhi raashtra-niti ke anukool ghoshit kiya he
 Seeing such discussions in 'kautilya Arthashastra', Mudrarakshaskaar poet Vishakhadatta Chanakya has been called untruthful and Banabhatta has condemned 'kautilya Arthashastra' as 'nirguna' and 'atinrushyansprayopadesham'
 'manjushri mulkalp' naam kii ek naveen uplabdh aitihaasik kriti main kautilya ko ‘durmati’, krodhan or ‘paapak’ pukarkar garha kaa paatr pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Many modern Western scholars, who specialize in orientalism, have also compared Kautilya to the famous author and politician Mekiavali of Europe, who, in his book 'the Prince', saw the above unethical systems, taking shelter of all the improper means appropriate to achieve the goal
 Has preached vinternitz aadi paashchaatya vidvan kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main nimnlikhit samanthaayen pradarshit karte hai: It is not rational to show such similarity in Kautilya and Mekiavali
 nissandeh kautilya bhi mekiyavali ke samaan yathartwaadee tha or keval adarshavaad kaa anuyaayi na tha
 But to say that Kautilya had completely abandoned religion or morality would be contrary to the truth
 kautilya ne ‘arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran main hi sthapana kii he; That is, do not let the king subjects be disinherited from their religion
 raja bhi apane dharm kaa aacharan kare
 The king who conducts his religion in this way remains happy in this world and the hereafter
 isi pratham adhikaran main hi raja dwaara amaryaadaaon ko vyavasthit karne par bhi bal diya gaya he or varna tathaa ashram-vyavastha ko sudrudh karne ke liye aadesh diya gaya he
 Here the trilogy and the Vedic rituals have been told the basic basis of protection of the subjects
 kautilya ne sthaan-sthaan par raja ko vridhon kii sangat karne vaala, vidya se vinamr, jitendriya or kaam-krodh aadi shatru-shadvarg kaa daman karne vaala kaha he
 How can such a king persecute people by becoming irreligious or tyrannical? In contrast, the king has been called father-like for the subjects, who does the upbringing, enrichment, protection, maintenance, teaching, etc
 of his subjects as he does for his children
 yah thik he ki kautilya ne shatrunash ke liye aniatik upayon ke karne kaa bhi upadesh diya he
 But in this regard the following word of economics should not be forgotten: arthath- in kootneeti ke upayon kaa vyavhaar keval adharmik evam dusht logon ke saath hi kare, dharmik logon ke saath nahin
 Kautilya's state theory is an important contribution to Indian political thought
 usne raajnneetik shaastra ko dharmikata kii ore adhik jhuke hone kii pravriti se mukt kiya
 Although he does not oppose religion and morality, he has kept politics free from the restrictions of ordinary morality
 is drushti se uske vichaar europea darshanik maikyavali ke vichaaron kaa purv sanket prathit hote hai
 On this basis, he is also called the "machiavelli of India"
 celitor kaa mat he ki kautilya kii tulana arastu se karnaa uchit hoga, kyonki donon hi satta hastgat karne ke sthaan par rajya ke uddeshyon ko adhik mahatva dete hai
 Being realistic, Kautilya has focused more on the practical side of the state
 kautilya kaa rajya yadhyapi sarvadhikari he, kintu vah janhit ke prati udasin nahin he
 Of all the institutions that have existed in human society, the most frightening is the practice of slavery
 manushya ke haathon manushya kaa bade paimaane par utpeedan is pratha ke anrtgat hua he
 Dasapratha can be called the culmination of institutional exploitation
 asia, europe, africa, america aadi sabhi bhukhndon main udai haanevaali sabhyataaon ke itihaas main daastaa ne saamaajik, raajnneetik tathaa aarthik vyavasthaaon ke nirmaan evam parichaalan main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 Slavery was found in naked forms in civilizations that were primarily built, raised and rested on the strength of the sword
 pashchimi sabhyataa ke vikaas ke itihaas main daspratha ne vishisht bhoomika adaa kii he
 In the development of any other civilization, slaves have probably neither given such a huge sum, nor has there been such widespread exploitation and oppression of man by man in the name of slavery elsewhere
 paashchaatya sabhyataa ke sabhi yugon main - unani, roman, madhyakaalin tathaa aadhunik- daason ne sabhyataa kii bhavy imaarat ko apane paseene or rakt se uthaaya he
 The earliest sources of Greek history describe the existence of slavery
 yunaan ke adikavi homer ke mahakavyon - odissi tathaa elliod - main daastaa ke astitv tathaa usase utpann naitik patan kaa ullekh he
 BC After 800, the establishment of Greek colonies and development of industries increased the demand and supply of slaves
 daason kii prapti kaa pradhan strot tha yuddh main praapt bandi kintu matapita dwaara santanvikray, apharan tathaa sangathit dasabajaron se kray dwaara bhi das praapt hote the
 Those indebted persons who were unable to pay their debts, also sometimes had to accept slavery for its repayment
 athens, cyprus tathaa semos ke dasabajaron main asian, africa athwa europea daason kaa kray vikray hota tha
 Slaves were kept for domestic work or for agriculture and industrial work

 Sometimes Swami was pleased and voluntarily freed the slave and sometimes the slave could purchase his freedom himself
 yunaan main das bahut badi sankhya main the or aisa anumaan he ki athens main daason kii sankhya swatantra nagarikon se bhi adhik thi
 The basis of the distinction between slaves and citizens was social status rather than species
 praaia: sabhi unani vichaarkon ne daastaa par apane mat prakat kiye hai
 According to Aristotle, slavery was beneficial for both the master and the slave, but Aflatun opposed slavery because he considered it immoral

 Slavery has been associated mostly with warlords
 vijetaon dwaara apni seva ke liye parajiton kaa upyog karnaa yuddh kii swaabhaavik parinti rahi he
 The rise and spread of the Roman Empire was on the military force, so the practice of slavery in Rome was widespread
 roman ganraajya ke uttarardh main jab adhikansh swasth roman nagarikon ko kartheji yudhon main sanlagn hona padaa to bhuswamiyon ne yudhbandiyon ko krishikaryon ke liye daason ke rup main kray karnaa prarambh kiya
 These wars led to an unprecedented spread of slavery in Rome
 prakaar kaa anumaan isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki us samay delos dweep ke ek pramukh dasabazar main ek din main 10,000 daason kaa krayvikray saadhaaran baat thi
 It is said that when a citizen died in the time of Augustus, he alone had four thousand slaves at that time
 sheeghra hi italvi gram samudaayon main daason kaa bahumat ho gaya
 In the cities also, slaves were kept for domestic work

 The most powerful slave rebellion in BC Around 73 led by Spartacus, a heroic leader of the Gladiators
 vidrohi dassenaon kaa aakaar nirantar badhata gaya or ek samay to samast dakshini italy daason ke haath main chalaa gaya tha
 In the last phase of the Roman Empire, when the empire stopped, new slaves ceased to be received
 falat: roman daason kii sthiti bhi sudharne lagi
 Quasi-slavery began to grow in place of slavery
 roman samrajya tathaa vyavastha kii asthirataa ev patan kaa ek pradhan kaaran daspratha thi
 It was natural for the majority of slaves to have no attachment to the system standing on their exploitation and oppression
 aisi sthiti main roman vyavastha kii jaden saamaajik drushti se adhik pusht na ho sakin
 After the disintegration of the Roman Empire, which brought slavery to the pinnacle of cruelty, there was some decrease in the rigor of slavery in Europe
 ab europea deshon ko adhiktar das slav kshetra se praapt hote the
 The word slave has a derivation of the word "slave", a synonym for English and European languages
 europe main 10veen tathaa 14veen shatee ke bich daspratha saamaanya rup main chalati rahi
 Around the 14th century, the invasion of Eastern Europe and West Asia, Western Europe began to receive prisoners of war again
 madhyayug ke antim charan main rashtrawaad or kattar dharmikata ke sammishran se yudhbandiyon ke prati ashishnutaa barti gai
 The proclamation of the supreme clergy pope himself was once issued by non-christian prisoners to proclaim them "slaves of Jesus" and purchase them as slaves

 The fate of Italian slave traders once again shone with the attainment of the pows

 From this period, the Islamic empire of Ottoman Turks also increased slavery

 The trade of African slaves first began by sea route
 portugal main daason kii maang nirantar badhati ja rahi thi kyonki moore yudhon evam aupniveshik prasar ke kaaran portugali jansankhya ghatati ja rahi thi
 The import of slaves increased so much that in the 16th century, the number of captives in many areas of Portugal exceeded that of the white
 chunki daastaa main rangabhed prabal nahin tha atev mukt rup se raktsanmishran hota tha
 Habshi blood and white blood still flow together in Portuguese arteries

 The introduction of slavery into the modern era of Western civilization once again led to the spread of slavery like the Roman era when adventurous European sailors explored the American continents and laid the foundations of colonies
 nai duniya ke pashchimi dweepasmooh, mexica, peru, brazil aadi deshon main utpaadit ganne, kapaas, tambaakoo jaisi vastuon kii maang europe main hone lagi
 The cheapest production of these goods was based on the labor of the slave
 spain ke tatwadhan main sarvapratham nai duniya kii khoj karanevaale columbus ne swayan hi pashchimi dweepasmoohon ke muulavaasiyon ko das bananaa prarambh kiya tha
 Thereafter, the plight of the sons of the earth of these European colonies as slaves can be inferred from the fact that by the end of Spain's colonial era, the caribou natives of the western islands had disappeared
 udhar dakshini america ke brazil aadi deshen main portugaliyon ne bade paimaane main vyapaar chalaaya
 According to the Christian European "civilians", the only way to civilize the "uncivilized" indigenous people into the "true religion" was to enslave them and in the process of civilizing everything was excusable

 Historically, the place of this fort has at least evidence of a royal fort from the 12th century
 yah kila san 1633 tak shahi nivas ke rup main satyapit rahaa tha
 From the 15th century onwards, the residential importance of this fort began to decline and from the 17th century onwards it was used primarily as a military base

 mcdonald In political science, positivism is a theory that considers knowledge acquired only through scientific method as irrelevant, reliable and authentic
 pratyakshvaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki pratyakshvaad vigyaan kii madad se udyog, utpaadan evam aarthik pragati ke liye aashaa kii kiran he
 From this point of view, Marx's scientific materialism is also close to positivism, because Marx has held him to the test of logic
 comte kaa kahana he ki ‘‘koi bhi vastu sakaaratmak tabhi ho sakati he jab use indriya gyaan ke dwaara siddh kiya ja sake, arthath dekha, suna, chakhaa yaa anubhav kiya ja sake
 '' vyavahaarwad ke aagaman se raajnneeti vigyaan main paramparaagat raajnneetik siddhanth kaa sthaan aadhunik raajnneetik siddhanth ne le liya
 Modern political theory emphasized on making political science value-neutral at the initial point of its life
 isliye yah swaabhaavik he ki aisa vigyaan ke antargat hi sambhav he
 The pragmatists made the scientific method the basis of study and analysis to make political science like natural science
 isi vaigyanik paddati ke kaaran raajnneeti-vigyaan main pratyakshvaad kii avadharana kaa aagaman hua
 Although positivism is also found in Greek philosophy
 arastu ne vaigyanik paddati ke aadhaar ke rup main pratyakshvaad yaa sakaaratmakawaad ke vichaar kaa hi poshan kiya tha
 From Aristotle to Aust Comte, human nature has been sought by many people and thinkers to make perfection and scientificity the guide of human life and behavior through scientific measures
 vigyaan ke vikaas ke saath-saath samaaj ke vyavhaar kaa har pahalu bhi prabhavit hone se saamaajik vigyaan main vaigyanik paddati kaa prayog hona aam baat he
 The scientific interpretation of positivism was first made by August Comte
 comte ne apni rachanaaon ‘course of Positive Philosophy’ main tathaa ‘the system of Positive Polity’ main is avadharana kii vyakhya kii he
 For this reason, Comte is considered the originator of positivism
 comte ne maanav itihaas kaa adhyayan karke tathaa usamen audyogic va vaigyanik pragati kaa sthaan nishchit karke yah daawa kiya ki usne maanav samaaj ke aadharbhoot niyamon kaa gyaan praapt kar liya he or usne vishwaas vyakt kiya ki yadi in niyamon ko sahi dhang se kaary rup pradaan kar diya jaae to maanav pragati ek vaigyanik tareeke se viksit hokar apane purnatv ko praapt ho sakati he
 Comte believed that when human development is attained to perfection, then the ancient beliefs, traditions and new values will end and they will be replaced by new traditions, beliefs and values, in which the state's form and the whole political and social framework Change will come
 comte ne maanviya gyaan kii prayek shakha ko apni praudhavastha tak pahunchane ke liye teen charnon se hokar guzarana sweekaar kiya he
 Comte says that the development of society is only through human intelligence and it has three stages - pratham avasthaa main manushya is baat main vishwaas karata he ki sristi ke nirmaan main prakritik shaktiyon yaa devi-devataaon kaa haath he arthath vah samast ghatnaon kii vyakhya alokik yaa aadhyatmik shaktiyon ke sandarbh main kahata he
 In the second stage all events are interpreted on the basis of abstractions and approximations
 manushya is sristi ke nirmaan main aatma jaise suksham tatwon par vichaar karne lagata he
 This state works to prepare the ground of positivism because of preparing the role of new state in place of old
 teesri avasthaa main manushya yah vishwaas karne lagata he ki is prakruti kii sari ghatnaayen nirvikaar prakritik niyamon se bandhi padi he
 In this state, instead of the creation of the human mind, the human mind thinks about its functioning, rules and logic, the practical things of the intellect
 isi aadhaar par comtai ne itihaas kii vyakhya karke apana sakaaratmakawaad yaa pratyakshvaad kaa siddhanth pratipaadit kiya he
 Comte has expressed the belief that the direct state will be the final stage of human development and that this stage can be attained as quickly as the religious and intellectual end of beliefs and the public will adopt the process of thinking scientifically
 isi vishwaas ke aadhaar par hi comte ne apana sakaaratmak sarkaar, sakaaratmak dharm, sakaaratmak shiksha, sakaaratmak rajya va kanoon ke siddhanth pratipaadit kiye hai taaki maanav samaaj main dharmik andhvishwaason ke prati jagriti aae tathaa log nae sire se sochane lagen or janata main vaigyanik soch kaa vikaas ho
 It is clear from the above discussion that Comte has nurtured the idea of positivism under the scientific method
 comte ne isi baat par jor diya he ki indri gyaan se pare kuch bhi vaastavik nahin he
 The real is what we see and hear and use in our lives
 sabhi manushyon main nirikshan kii ek jaisi kshamta pai jaati he
 Therefore, we can combine our experience with the experience of others and confirm and validate it
 iske baad anubhavvatmak kathan taarkik kathan ban jate hai kyonki ham prayek kathan ko tark kii kasuti par rakhte hai
 When using the scientific method under political science, only the empirical and logical statement is important because it is easily confirmed and verified
 isliye vaigyanik paddati ke samarthak raajnneeti vigyaan main aise kisi bhi kathan kaa virodh karte hai jo mulya-saapeksh ho
 Later proponents of positivism rejected the positivist interpretation given by Comte
 in vidwaanon ne maiks webar, vienna cirkil, tii0di0 vailden, moritz shlik, ludvikh vitgenstin tathaa e0je0 air shaamil hai
 These scholars are called neo-positivists or logical positivists
 webar ne kaha ki vigyaan hamen is baat kaa uttar nahin detaa he ki hamen kya karnaa chahie or kis prakaar kaa jivan jeena chahie
 Educational knowledge does not help us to explain the meaning of creation
 isliye iske bare main paraspar virdohi baton main saamanjasy kaayam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Political philosophy can never be interpreted on the basis of positivism
 kyonki raajnneeti-darshan apni-apni abhiruchi kaa vishay he or ise anubhavatmak drushti se parakhnaa moorkhrata he
 In this way, positivism about political philosophy has become a subject of criticism for not being helpful
 aage chalakar uttaravyavahaarwadiyon ne bhi raajnneeti-vigyaan main pratyakshvaad kii aalochana kii he kyonki yah mulya-nirpeksh drushtikon kaa samarthak he
 In contemporary thinking, the attack on positivism under critical theory is worth noting
 harbart marcujo kaa kahana he ki aaj ke yug main raajnneeti vigyaan kii bhashaa ko prakritik vigyaan kii bhashaa ke anuroop dhaalane kii koshish ho rahi he taaki manushya apane sochane ke dhang se yathasthiti kaa samarthak ban jaae
 Some critics say that if Comte's plan of positivism succeeds, it will give rise to a new kind of papacy in which the addition of the three goldsmiths, the Suras and the Sundarias will leave the people open for fun
 isse spasht he ki comte kaa pratyakshvaad ‘laissezfaire’ ke siddhanth kaa samarthak he
 From the above discussion, we should not conclude that Comte's positivism is blank imagination or blank idealism
 satya to yah he ki aage chalakar je0 es0 mil jaise vichaarak bhi comte ke pratyakshvaad kaa prabhaav padaa
 Thinkers like Richard Congreve and Herbert Spencer were also influenced by Comte
 comte kaa pratyakshvaad raajnneeti-vigyaan kii ek mahatvapurn vichaardhaara or siddhanth he
 For this reason, Comte is the father of positivism and as a principle and ideology of positivism, he owes eternal importance which is the basis of scientific study even today
 jet nodan yaa kshippranodan, nodan kii vah vidhi he jisamen vastu par aage kii taraf dhakka lagane ke liye us vastu kii gati kii vipareet disha main padaarth kaa jet kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Its mechanism is based on Newton's third law of motion
 yah ek prakaar kii pratikriya pranodan he arthath isamen pratikriya kii shakti ko kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 This propulsion is often used in jet engines
 isi prakaar antariksh yanon ke liai bhi jet nodan sabase adhik upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The process of moving beyond jet propulsion is also seen in many animals, such as headparts, arthropod animals, sea rabbits, and fishes
 newton ke teen prasiddh niyamon main se ek yah he ki har kaary kii pratikriya hoti he
 For example, if any weight is given above the table, this load is acting as the table is pressed downwards and because the table is lifting this load, the table pressure is upward due to which the load is lifted
 isi upree dabaav ko pratikriya kaha jaataa he or jahaan bhi koi kaary ho rahaa ho, pratikriya kaa kisi na kisi rup main hona aavashyak he
 When a gun is fired, it is pushed backwards
 yadi is bandook ke peeche koi gend rakh di jaae to is dhakke ke kaaran gend uchhalkar bahut dur ja sakati he
 In each machine, the action power is employed and arrangements are made to withstand the reaction, such as firing a gun into a gun and causing it to withstand the blows
 parantu kshippranodan main isi pratikriya se vah kaam liya jaataa he jo acchhee mashine bhi nahin kar saktin
 Piston engines have been used to run all types of motor vehicles, air and water vessels
 din prati din in injanon main nai nai khoj hoti rahi or inase adhik se adhik shakti praapt hone lagi
 The demands of more rapid movement of these machines have led to the appraisal of these engines that their further development is no longer possible
 saath hi saath is unnati ke kaaran inaki mashine itani ulajh gayi ki inaki suvidha se bananaa or upyog karnaa kathin ho gaya
 Hence the use of gas turbine, due to which the speed of air and water vessels was greatly increased
 ab kshippranodan ko do prakaar se liya ja saktaa he, ek to gas tarabine ke saath or doosraa keval kship kaa hi upyog
 If the exit hole of this gas is small then it will come out with force, which will push the car and it will start moving forward
 jaise jaise gas jor se baahar niklegi vaise vaise gaadi kii chaal bhi badhati jaaygi
 If the car is light and does not have friction
 to isaki chaal adhik tej hogi
 The reason for this vehicle to run in this way is said here that when the gas comes out of the hole, it hits the air outside and that is why the vehicle moves forward, but this is not the case
 yadi ise bina hawa ke sthaan par chalaaya jaay to isaki chaal or bhi teevr hogi
 So it is only the reaction that drives it
 is prakaar peeche nikalanevaali kship ke dabaav ke hi kaaran yah shakti praapt hoti he
 Whereas more speed was required, tilting was used
 vastut: kshippranodan kaa vyavhaar vahiin par safal hoga jahaan adhik gati kii aavashyaktaa ho
 In order to save time during the war, Kship airplanes were advanced and used in flying bombs
 bhoomi par chalanevaali mashiinon main gharshan adhik hota he
 And they cannot be run at high speed
 at: unamem kshippranodan laabhkar siddh nahin hua
 The actual advancement of tricyclicity occurred in air and water vessels
 is prakaar ke hawaii jahaajon ke halake injanon or teevr chaal ne samay ko itnaa gata diya he ki sansar ke ek kone se duusare kone main bahut thode samay main hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 There is only one rule for all types of locomotives
 sab ingine baahar kii hawa ko apane bheetar khinchate hai or iske bheetar hawa tathaa eendhan mil jate he, jahaan donon jalakar failte he
 Due to this spread the machine gets pushed
 jalane ke samay eendhan or hawa kii nishpati adhik hoti he or jab mashin chal padati he to hawa kaa mishran adhik ho jaataa he
 The gas produced by the burning of air and fuel is given more speed
 gas ko adhik gati usee samay mil sakati he jab use thik prakaar se failane kaa avasar diya jaae
 But the pressure of the gas will decrease in this spread, because the gas has to be released in the same air from where the air was drawn in to mix with the fuel
 isliye daab ke ghatane se puri shakti praapt na hogi
 As long as there is no full pressure behind the gas, propulsion will not be able
 at: gas ke peeche puri daab praapt karne ke liye sampidak mashin kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 a gas turbine is installed to run this compressor
 hawa ko sampidak baahar se khinchakar tarabine kii ore puure bal kesath phenkata he
 The fuel is mixed between the turbine and the compressor in this air and this mixture is given an opportunity to burn
 iske jalane se aaytan tathaa taap ek hi daab par badhate hai
 This power is so much that it can run the turbine and it also has full kinetic energy for its operation
 sampidak hawa ko khinchakar dahan kothriyon ko detaa he, jahaan eendhan pehle se jalataa hua miltaa he or yah gas adhik taap par tarabine ko jaati he
 The turbine runs from this gas and it also drives the turbine compressor
 tarabine se nikalakar yah gas kship kii bhanti failati hui adhik daab par baahar nikalati he
 This turbine consumes less fuel than other engines at running time, but at increased speeds it takes less fuel from all engines
 oonchaai par pahunchakar to yah or bhi kam eendhan kharch karata he
 The speed of the airplane operating from this turbine is not required
 samay kii bachat or lambii yatraaon ke liye aavashyak he ki hawaii jahaaj kaa vajan kam ho or gati adhik
 This can happen if the airplane only has tarnishing in which turbines are not used
 isaki mashin main bahut se kal purajon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 This machine has only three parts
 pehla bhaag aage kaa he jisame hawa ke liye kapaat hai or eendhan kii nalee he jiske dwaara pump se eendhan bheetar phenkaa jaataa he
 Due to timely opening of these valves, air enters
 yah kapaat us samay band hote hai jab eendhan or hawa jalakar gas ban jaati he
 The fuel bursts and the gas escapes
 doosraa bhaag dahan kothri kaa he or teesraa bhaag ingine ke peeche kii naalee kaa he, jisaki lambaai ingine kii shakti ke anusaar rakhi jaati he
 When it has to be run, fuel is first sprayed and set on fire
 is samay hawa ke kapaat khul jate hai or hawa bheetar aakar eendhan ke saath mil jaati he
 Adulteration is done properly
 eendhan or hawa kaa mishran lagbhag 2 milicenkad main jal jaataa he or iskaa taap 250 sein
 or daab 100 pratishat bad jaati he
 Now this gas goes towards the drain so it spreads before going into the drain
 jab yah naalee main jaati he to naalee kaa vyas chota hone ke kaaran iskaa taap 9000 sein
 or daab ghatakar 95 pratishat ho jaati he
 The time it takes to get out of the closet can be 8 milliseconds
 is prakaar eendhan or hawa ke mishran se utpann dhadaaka ek duusare ke pashchaat jaldi jaldi hoti he
 On the force of this blast and the rapid exit of the gas, the machine is found for propulsion
 eendhan ko pehle bijli se jalaayaa jaataa he, kintu mashin ke chalane par dahan kothri itani tap jaati he ki eendhan apane aap hi jal jaataa he
 The length of the fuel drain is kept so that the gas bursts out before the air valve opens
 is prakaar kii mashiinon kaa upyog aapse aap chalanevaale bamgolon main kiya gaya tha or ab hawaii jahaajon main kiya jaataa he, parantu isak chalaane ke liye lambey sthaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or chalane ke samay isaki gati adhik honi chahie
 It was previously thought that replacing the piston engine would not require much tomorrow if it was used to replace the piston engine, but it did not
 kshippranodan ke upyog ke saath hi yah pataa chalaa ki keval eendhan ke panpon ko badi saavdhaanee se bananaa he or eendhan tathaa hawa kaa niyantran thik rakhana nitant aavashyak hai
 Suppose the volume of gas released is per second and its speed is c
 mashin ko chalaanevaali shakti m x ga hui
 If the area of the exit point of the gas is q, then there will be two pressures at this place, one is the pressure of the exiting gas which is Ni 1 and the other is the pressure of air at this place, say, Ni 2
 ye donon daaben ek duusare ke viruddh hongi
 Hence the pressure at this place will be q which will work with mx c
 isliye pranodan kii puri shakti = m x ga + ksha hogi
 If the gas exit hole is made so that the pressure spreads to the gas, then Ni1 = Ni2, so power = m x c
 yahi pranoday kaa samirkan kaha jaataa he
 The performance ratio of propulsion can be shown from the following equation
 jahaan ga kship kii gati he or r mashin ke chalane kii gati
 This working ratio would be greatest if c = r, that is, if the speed of the machine is equal to the speed of the speed

 agar tum uske jivan main koi aakarshan paidaa kar sako, jisase vaungali sardiyon main prachlit hone vaale kapado ke faishan ke bare main charchaa karne lage, to uske jeene kii sambhaavna kam se kam dooni ho jaayegi
 " doctor ke jane ke baad su apane kamare main gayi or usne ro-ro kar kai roomaal nichodne kaabil kar diye
 After a while, carrying the painting material, she arrives at Janci's room whistling
 jansi, chaddar odhe, chupchaap, bina hile-dule, khidki kii ore dekhati padi thi
 Knowing him asleep, he stopped whistling
 takhte par kaagaj lagaakar vah kisi patrika kii kahani ke liye, kalam syaahi se ek tasviir banane baithi
 In order to reach the stage of 'kala', budding artists have to make photographs for magazines
 jaise sahitya kii manzil tak pahunchane ke liye, navdith lekhakon ko patrikaon kii kahaniyaan likhni padatihai
 As soon as Su, wearing breezes like a horseman, wearing an eyeglass, began drawing lines of an Idaho shepherd's image, he heard a slow sound repeated several times
 vah sheeghra hi biimaar ke bistare ke paas gayi
 Jansi's eyes were wide open
 vah khidki se baahar dekh rahi thi or kuch ginati bol rahi thi
 But she is chanting in reverse
 vah boli,"baarah" fir kuch der baad "gyaarah" fir "das" or "nau" or tab ek saath "aath" or "saat"
 Soo glanced out of the window, eagerly
 vahaan ginaney laayak kya tha
 An open, barren square or a blank wall of a brick house twenty feet away! ek puraani, shanthi hui, jade nikali hue,
 sadabahaar kii bel diwaar kii aadhi oonchai tak chadhi hui thi
 Shishir's cold breath had broken the leaves of his body and his skeletal branches, utterly oblivious, were hanging from those broken bricks
 su ne poocha,"kya he jaani?" Jansi said in very slow voices, "six! Now she is falling fast
 teen din pehle vahaan kareeb ek sau tha
 He used to hurt them by counting their heads
 vah, ek or giri
 Now only five left
 " "five what? Jani, five what? Tell your sou!" "pattiyaan
 The leaves of that vine
 jis vakt aakhri pattee giregi, main bhi chali jaaoongi
 i have known this for three days
 kya doctor ne tumhen nahin bataaya?" With great disdain, Soo complained, "oh! i have never seen anything so stupid
" tere thik hone kaa in pattiyon se kya sambandh he? tu us bail se pyaar kiya karti thi-kyon isliye? badmaash! apni bevakoofi band kar! abhi subah hi to doctor ne bataaya tha ki tere jaldi se thik hone kii sambhaavna-thik kin shabdo main kahaan tha-haa, kaha tha, sambhaavna rupaye main chaudaa aana he or neuyark main, jab ham kisi taxi main baithte hai yaa kisi nayi imaarat ke paas se guzarate hai, tab bhi jeene kii sambhaavna isse aadhik nahin rahati
 Now try to drink a little broth and let your soo make a picture, so that by selling it to the editor, he can get some medicine for his sick girl and some bread and water for his own stomach
 " Jansi said keeping her eyes outside the window, "you don't need to bring alcohol for me anymore
 vah, ek or giri
 No, i don't even need broth
 ab sirf chaar rah gayin
 Before i get dark, i can see that last leaf falling - that's all
 fir main bhi chali jaaoongi
 " su us par jhukati hui boli,'pyaari jansi! tuje pratigya kerani hogi ki tu ankhe band rakhegi or jab tak main kaam karti hum, khidki se baahar nahin dekhegi
 This picture has to be delivered by tomorrow
 mujhe roshni kii jarurat he, varna abhi khidki band kar detii
 " jansi ne ruukhaai se poocha,"kya tum duusare kamare main baithkar tasviren nahin ban sakati?" Soo said, "I must stay with you
" iske alaava, main tuje us bel kii taraf dekhne dena nahin chaahati
 " kisi giri hui murti kii tarah nishchal or safed, apni aakhe band karti hui, jansi boli,"kaam khatm hote hi mujhe bol dena, kyoking main us aakhri pattee ko girte hue dekhnaa chaahati hum
 Now i want to loosen my grip and let it float down and down like those tired leaves
 " Soo said, "you trying to sleep
" main khan main majdoor kaa model banane ke liye us beharman ko bula laati hum
 Now, it came in a minute
 jab tak main nahin launtun, tu hilanaa mat!" The old Behrman lived in a room under him
 vah bhi chitrakaar tha
 He was over sixty years old
 uski dadhi, maaykele angelo kii tasviir ke mojes kii dadhi kii tarah, kisi badashakl bandar ke sir se kisi bhoot ke sharir tak laharaati maaloom padati thi
 Beraham was a failed artist
 chalis varsho se vah sadhana kar rahaa tha, lekin abhi tak apni kala ke charan bhi nahin chhu sakaa tha
 While making every picture, he would think that it would be his masterpiece, but could never make it like that
 idhar kai varsho se usne vyavsaayik yaa vigyaapan-chitra banane ke sivaay, yah dhandha hi chhod diya tha
 Being a Mandal for young artists who could not pay the fees of a professional Mandal, he used to fill his stomach nowadays
 vah jarurat se zyada sharaab pi letaa or apni us utkrasht krati ke vishay main bakawaas karata jiske sapane vah sanjota tha
 By the way, he was a very old man who used to make fun of meek men and would think of himself as the guard dog of these two young artists
 su ne beharman ko apane andhere adde main padaa paaya
 The smell of plum was coming out of it
 ek kone main vah kora canvaas khadaa tha, jo uski utkrasht kalakrati kii pahili rekha kaa ankan paane kii, pachchis varsho se baat joh rahaa tha
 He tells the old man how Jansi, fearfully imagining his leaves to be swayed by associating them with those soft bodies like his leaves, thinks that his grip on the world will be loosened
 buudhe beharman ne in murkh kalpanaaon par gusse se ankhe nikaal kar apana tiraskaar vyakt kiya
 He said, "what did you say? Are there even such fools in the world, who just because they are falling leaves with a bruised vine, imagine themselves dead? i have never heard such a thing! i am a fool like you
 Can never be a model for crazy people
 tumne uske dimag main is baat ko ghusane hi kaise diya? are, bichaari jansi!" Suu said, "she has become very weak due to illness and due to fever, such strange fantasies have arisen in her mind
 acha; buudhe beharman, tum agar mere liye model nahin bananaa chaahate to mat bano
 After all, it's the owl's tail! " berahaman chillaaya,"tu to ladki kii ladki hi rahi! kisne kaha ki main model nahin banuunga? chal, main tere saath chalata hum
 i have been whining for half an hour that i will walk! But let me say one thing - this place is not fit for a good girl like Jansi to die
 kisi din jab mai apni utkrasht kalakrati bana luungaa tab ham sab yahaan se chal chalenge
 Understand? Yes! " jab ve log upar pahunche to jansi so rahi thi
 Soo dropped the curtains on the windowsill and took Behrman to another room
 vahaan se unhone bhaybheet drashti se khidki ke baahar us bel kii ore dekha
 Then they, without uttering a single word, looked at each other
 apane saath barf liye huye thandi barsaat lagaataar gir rahi thi
 a kettle was turned upside down and Behrman was placed in a blue shirt to make it the model of a mine worker sitting on a rock
 ek ghante kii neend ke baad jab duusare din subah, su kii aankh khuli to usne dekha ki jansi jad hokar, khidki ke hare parde kii ore ankhe faad kar dekh rahi he
 In a tone of fury, he ordered, "raise the curtain, i want to see
 " Su was helpless and had to obey
 lekin yah kya! raat bhar varsha, aandhi toofaan or barf girane par bhi into kii diwaar se lagi hui, us bel main ek pattee thi
 Some dark green near her stalk, but pale yellow around its edges and anticipating further loss, the leaf was some twenty feet high from the ground yet hanging from its branch
 jansi ne kaha," yahi aakhri he
 i thought it would fall in the night
 mainen toofaan kii aawaaj bhi suni
 Well, never mind it will fall today and i will die at the same time
 " Tilting her tired face on the pillow, Soo said, "what does she say! Take care of me, if not your own! What shall i do?" par jansi ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 The lonely thing in this world is this 'soul', when it prepares to go on its mysterious long journey
 jyon-tyon sansar or mitrataa se baandhne vaale uske bandhan dhile padate gayi tyon-tyon uski kalpana ne use adhik jor se jakadna shuru kar diya
 The day passed, and even in the faint light of the evening, the leaf hanging from the wall-mounted vine, was visible to them
 par tabhi raat padane ke saath-saath, uttari hawaaen fir chalane lageen or varsha kii jhadiyaan khidki se takaraa kar chajje par bah aayin
 As soon as the lights came on, the merciless Jansi ordered that the curtain be lifted
 bel main pattee ab tak maujuud thi
 Jansi kept staring at it for long
 usne su ko pukaara, jo chauke main stove par murgi kaa shorwa bana rahi thi
 Jancy said, "sudi, I'm a very bad girl
 kudarat kii kisi shakti ne, us antim pattee ko vahiin roak kar, mujhe yah bataa diya ki main kitni dusht hum
 To die in this way is a sin
 laa, mujhe thodaa-sa shorwa de or kuch doodh main jehar milakar laa de
 But no, before that give me a little mirror and put some pillows at my head so that i can see you sitting and cooking
 " After an hour she said, "sudi, i think i will make a picture of the Bay of Naples at some time
" " In the evening, Dr
 Saheb came again, made some excuse and went outside and met him
 su de durbal kaanpate haath ko apane haathon main lekar doctor sahab bole, "ab sambhaavna aath aana maani ja sakati he
 If the care is good then you will win and now i am going to see each other on the floor below
 kya naam he uskaa- beharman!-shaayad koi kalakaar he-nimonia ho gaya he
 He is very weak and bad man, and he is very loud
 bachane kii koi sambhaavna nahin
 Today i will send him to the hospital
 vahaan aaraam zyada milegaa
 " duusare din doctor ne su se kaha,"jansi, ab khatre se baahar he
 You won ab to sirf pathya or dekhbhaal kii jarurat he
 " us din shaam ko su, jansi ke palang ke paas aakar baith gayi
 She was weaving a pale bouquet of blue wool, restless
 usne takiye ke us ore se, apni baanh, su ke gale main daal di
 Soo said, "my naive cat, you have one thing to say
 aaj subah aspataal main, mistar beharman kii nimonia se mratyu ho gayi
 He had been ill only twice
 parason subah hi chaukeedaar ne use apane kamare main dard se tadapata paaya tha
 His clothes — even shoes — were completely soaked and cold as ice
 koi nahin jaanata ki ansi bhayanak raat main vah kahaan gaya tha
 But a burning lantern, a cistern, two-four brushes and some green and yellow paint were found on the panel from his room
 jaraa khidki se baahar to dekh-diwaar ke paas kii us antim pattee ko

 In 1922 Howard Roark is a student of architecture at a prestigious college
 use college se nikaal diya jaataa he kyonki yah chetavanee baar-baar milane ke baavjood ki uske banaae imaaraton ke nakshe or dizine pratha se hat rahen hai or use waapas sahi maarg par aana chahie, vah is vishvas par atal rahata he ki imaaraton ko apane sthaan, saamagree or prayog ke hisaab se saralata or sundarata se bananaa chahie
 Classical methods were valued in college and in the architecture world at the time, while Roark thought that if a construction did not require a pillar, arch or other element, it should not be put there
 college kaa adhyaksh use ek antim mauqaa detaa he or kahata he ki vah apni galati maanakar saamaajik-str par pasand kii jane vaali shastreey nirmaan-pratha apana le kyonki rork main bahut kshamta or gun hai or vah aage chalakar ek prasidd, samrudh or safal architect ban saktaa he
 Roark refuses and is shown the college door
 rork new york jaakar henry camran naamak ek architect ke saath kaam karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 Cameron was once considered to be a rising star of the modernism wave of manufacturing but has been maligned because of its rude nature and social practice
 rork phir bhi us se prerit he or jaanboojh kar uske saath kaam karata he or us se bahut sikhta he
 At the same time a fellow student of Roark, Peter Keating, who is unpolitical but popular, passes from college with multiple honors
 college main vah aksar rork ke paas madad lene jaataa tha kyonki rork ke dizine sabase saafe or nipun hua karte the
 Keating joins New York's famous production company, Franken & Heyer
 vahaan keating jald hi apni saamaajik kushaltaaon or khushamadi se us company ke ek maalik, gaye francan, kaa priy ho jaataa he
 He goes in secret to help Roark to design his first building and draws a map based on his ideas, which is successful
 ek taraf camran or rork gazab ke adwitiya nirmaan banaate hai jinhen samaaj main adhik manyata nahin milti or duusari taraf keating kii chapalusee use tezi se kamyaabi detii he or use apni company main saathi bana diya jaataa he
 Cameron is growing old and closes his company
 isapar keating rork ko naukari detaa he, lekin jald hi aadesh na maanane ke liye ucch maalik rork ko nikaal detaa he
 Roark finds a job and hires a company that allows him to create the designs he wants, but on the condition that his designs are then given to other architects of the same company who then tweak them as per their custom
 
 vahaan ek graahak ko rork ke mul naqshe itane pasand aate hai ki rork company chhodkar apni nijee company khol letaa he, lekin usko bahut kam graahak milte hai
 Instead of changing his ideals, he closes his company
 phir vah francan kii hi ek pathar kii khan main mazaduri kaa kaam kar letaa he jahaan chattaane todna hi uskaa kaam hota he
 At the same time Keating's star is shining and at a gathering he meets and is attracted to Domenic Franken, the handsome and intelligent, but temperamental, daughter of Franken, the company's high boss
 dominik new york main hi ek "new york binar" naam ke akhbaar ke liye sameekshak-lekhak he
 One day Roark is working in a stone mine when Dominić passes by, as she is on a vacation for a few days at a family home in the same city
 vahaan dominik or rork ek duusare ko dekh lete hai or unamem foran aapasi aakarshan ho jaataa he
 But both are stiff with each other
 kuch dinon baad rork dominik ke ghar aata he or, ek-duusare se bina koi shabd bhi kahe, unamem shaareerik sambandh sthapit ho jate hai
 Soon after this, Roark gets the news that a customer is trying to get him to build a building and, before Dominic even knows his name, he returns to New York
 calzaworth tuhi dominik vaale akhbaar main hi architekchar par ek lokapriya lekhak he jo is vishay par bahut padhi jane vaali kitaaben bhi chhap chukaa he
 People are greatly influenced by his writings and dislike his stated buildings and constructions
 yah uske liye shahar ke prabhaavshaalee virgon main pravesh karne or shaktishaalee banane kaa ek zariyaa ban gaya he
 There is always the message of Tohi that art is a social subject and work should be for the public interest and public upliftment
 jab ek amir aadmi apane maranoparant use ek lakh dollar chhod gaya to tuhi ne yah raashi 'saamaajik adhyayan centre' naamak sanstha ko de di jahaan vah 'kala, ek saamaajik lakshan' ke vishay par leccherar tha
 Keating also wants to connect with Toohi's popularity and wants Toohi to show compassion to him in his writings as well
 or yahi hota bhi he
 Tohi Roark's liberty gets irritated by thought and style
 vah keating se rork ke bare main kai sawaal poochta he
 Does Roark laugh, does he seem unhappy, does he like money, does he want people's appreciation and has he always wanted to be an architect
 tuhi ab rork ko nasht karnaa chahta he
 Dominiak and Tohi both see Roark in a gathering and Dominiuk now knows his identity
 vah yah bhi bhaanp leti he ki tuhi uske viruddh abhiyaan chalaaegaa
 In her next article in the newspaper, she writes a tricky article about Roark's amazing building that calls him a ray of light but also seems to condemn him: tuhi ek kamazor-vyaktitv vaale amir seth ko rork dwaara 'maanav aatma kaa mandir' naam kaa ek smarak banavaane ke liye protsaahit karata he, jisamen rork ko apni manmarzi kaa nirmaan karne kii chhot milti he
 He includes in it a naked idol of Dominić, causing a cry against him
 tuhi ab usee seth se rork par dhokhaa or ayogyata kaa muqaddama chalavaataa he
 In this, many well-known architects come and give statements that Roark's methods break the practice and are wrong
 dominik muqaddame main rork ke samarthan main bayaan detii he lekin rork haar jaataa he
 His company then closes
 rork ke haarane ke baad dominik faisalaa karti he ki, kyonki is duniya main kabhi bhi rork jaise logon kii mahanata nahin sweekaari jaaegi, vah puri tarah vaastavik duniya main hi apana jivan guzaaregi jisamen keating jaise log hi safal hai
 She proposes marriage to Keating and Keating accepts
 iske liye keating ko tuhi kii bhanji ke saath apni sagaai todani hoti he, jo keating se behad pyaar karti he
 Dominić becomes a complete Keating - she invites influential people to her house to feast on Keating's business promotion, mixes everything with her and says exactly what she wants
 akhbaar main bhi vah keating kii prashansa main likhti he or rork kii ninda karti he
 Despite this, Roark continues to receive small amounts of customers who like his work
 dominik or tuhi jis akhbaar ke liye likhte hai uskaa maalik gail vynand naam kaa ek behad amir aadmi he
 He is a great builder and his work persuades Keating to sleep with Dominic Waynand
 vynand phir keating ko uski khamoshi kii keemat dekar dominik or keating kaa talaak karwaata he or phir swayan dominik se shaadi kar letaa he
 It is now known to him that the original architect of all the constructions he liked was actually Roark and he gives Roark the job of making himself and Dominiak's house
 vynand or rork main gahari dosti ho jaati he, haalanki vynand ko rork or dominik ke pichley rishte ke bare main kuch nahin pataa hota
 Dominić and Keating, who have lost their fame, realize that their lives have failed
 lekin vah tuhi se jaakar gidgidaata he ki vah use kisi tarah 'cortland nivas pariyojna' ke nirmaan kaa kaary dilava de, jiske liye sabhi architect utsuk hai or jise karne se use phir se khyaati mil sakati he
 Tohi gets him this job
 keating jaanata he ki uske sabhi safal nirmaanon ke peeche rork kaa dimaag rahaa he isliye vah sidhaa rork ke paas jaakar us se dizine main madad maangata he
 Roark agrees on one condition - he will secretly design Cortland but the construction must be exactly as he would have it been made
 dizine puraa kar ke rork vynand ke saath ek nauka yatra par nikal jaataa he
 When Roark returns, he learns that, despite Keating's promise, his design changes have been made
 vah jaakar cortland ko barood se uda daalata he
 The whole country considers Roark a criminal, but now Wayanand decides that he will support Roark
 vah apane akhbaaron ko rork kii himaayat karne ko kahata he
 There is anger in the public, so the sales of his newspapers start falling but with the help of the Dominic, he keeps on standing
 akhirkaar akhbaar kaa karmchaaree sangh aakar use chetavanee detaa he - yaa to vah rork kaa virodh kare varanaa uskaa akhbaar chhapana band ho jayega
 Wayanand concedes defeat and a strong condemnation of Roark is published in the newspaper
 adaalat main jab kaarywai shuru hoti he to lagata he ki rork ke bachane kii koi aashaa nahin he
 But there, Roark gives a rousing speech to the court attendees on personal freedom, original inventions and the value of staying true to their souls
 manushyon ko do virgon main vibhajit karte hue vah kahata he ki: The court holds Roark innocent
 vynand samaj jaataa he ki uskaa akhbaar vyaktigat kshamta or swatantraaa kuchalane kaa kaam karata he or vah use band kar detaa he
 He assigns Roark the task of building the world's tallest skyscraper
 18 maheene baad vynand imaarat taiyaar hone vaali hoti he
 In the final pages of the novel Dominić goes to the construction site and a new sentry asks Dominiak his name there
 dominik jawaab detii he "shrimati rork", jis se pataa chalata he ki ant main vah rork kii patni ban gai he
