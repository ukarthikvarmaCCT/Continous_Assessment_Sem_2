 Perl derivatives do not have uniformity in implementation of regular expressions and some implement only a subset of Perl's attributes
 Perl 5

NET Framework or Java se
 Simple regular expression is a syntax that can be used in historical versions of computer application programs and can also be supported by some applications within itself
 pichhali anurupata pradaan karne ke uddeshy se ise anuchit samajha gaya he
 In standard expressions standard modifiers are greedy, meaning they match as many times as they can, leaving the rest to be a new match with the regex
 udhaaharan ke liye,regexes ke liye koi nayaa jo kisi ek item ke bich pratham drushtaant khojna chahta he, is udhaaharan main pratik chihnon ke bich paa saktaa he
 Another whale exploration occurred
 


 jo, pattern ke saath athwa isi ke samaan aana chahega
 haalanki yah pattern vastav main ", " ke badale "" main waapas janaa chahega, jo apekshit tha, kyonki * parimann jo laalchee he -- atah yah yathasambhav adhik se adhik aksharon kaa upbhog input se kar lenaa chahega, evam "january 26>, " ke paas "january 26" kii tulana main adhik akshar honge
 While this problem can be avoided in many ways, modern regular expression tools allow a quantizer to be characterized as sluggish, followed by a question mark after the quantizer, or by using modifiers that reverse the measureer's greed
 gives 
 Indicators first try to match the least, using the sluggish measure
 haalanki purvavarti udhaaharan main sust mail kaa prayog kai melon ke parinaamon main se kisi ek kaa chunaav karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, kuch maamalon main iskaa prayog behatar nishpaadan ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, jab laalchee milan ko adhik peeche hatane kii jarurat padegi
 Patterns for Chaotic Languages many features derived from modern regular expression collections provide suggestive capabilities that exceed those of well-organized languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai karyanvayan up suchakon ke samoohikaran kii anumati pradaan karte hai or usee suchak main mail karaane kii keemat yaad dilaate hai
 This means that a pattern may correspond to repeated words, such as "papa" or "wikiwiki", which in formal language theory is called squares
 in ladiyon ke liye pattern he \ 1
 However, the language of squares is not well-organized
 na hi yah vishay se mukt he
 An unlimited number of back references coincide with the pattern, as is supported by an unlimited number of modern tools, np-complete
 haalanki, kai upkaran, libraries or ingine jo aisi sanrachanaayen uplabdh karaate hai, ab bhi regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa prayog apane patternas ke liye karte hai
 It has named the regular expression vocabulary, which has many different meanings for formal language theory and pattern
 is kaaran, kuch log regex yaa keval pattern shabdaawalee kaa prayog parvarti kii vyakhya main karte hai
 Larry Wall, author of the Perl programming language, writes about the design of Perl 6 in an essay: kam se kam teen alag-alag kalam vidhiyaan kalanvidhi hai, jo nirdhaarit karti hai ki ek diya gaya regular oxpraishan kis prakaar ek string ke saath mail khata he
 Two formal language theories dependent on the oldest and fastest results that accepts the conversion of each non-deterministic finite position machine into a deterministic finite position machine
 DFA kaa spasht rup se nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he or tab iske parinamswaroop input par ek baar main ek pratik chinh par parichaalit hota he
 Creating a DFA for the size of a regular expression at the cost of "O" takes time and memory, but it can only run in o time on a string of n sizes
 ek vaikalpik prayaas NFA ko sidhe anukaran karnaa he, maang karne par anivaary rup se prayek DFA sthiti kaa nirmaan or tab agle kadam par sambhawatah caching ke saath ise baahar nikaal dena
 yah DFA ko antarnihit rakhata he or nirmaan kii ghaataank laagat se bachaa ja saktaa he, lekin chalan laagat o tak bad jaati he
 This explicit step is called the DFA algorithm and the underlying step is called the NFA algorithm
 As both can be seen in different ways in implementing the same DFA, they are also often called algorithms without discrimination
 ye kalan vidhiyaan tej hai lekin samoohikrut upasuchakon ko lautaane ke liye unka prayog sust parimann evam isi prakaar kii visheshtaayen pechida hai
 The third algorithm is to match the input string with the pattern via the back track
 is kalanvidhi ko aamtaur par NFA kaha jaataa he, lekin yah shabdaawalee aspasht he
 Its running time can be exponential, which its simple implementation reveals when matching against indicators such as * b which has both alternation and infinite quantification
 kalanvidhi par jor daalate hai ki sthanapann maamalon kii babbti hui ghaataanki sankhya par vichaar karen
 adhik jatil karyanvayan aksar chihnit or gatisheel karte hai yaa saadhaaran maamalon ko radd kar detii hai, jab unka chalan mand ho jaataa he
 Although back tracking implementations guarantee an exponential in the worst case scenario, they provide much greater flexibility and pointer power
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi bhi karyanvayan jo bakarefrences ke prayog kii anumati detaa he yaa parl dwaara lagu kiye gaye vibhinn ekstensionas ko karyanvit karata he, use back trekking karyanvayan kaa avashya prayog karnaa chahie
 Some implementations provide two of the best algorithms by first running fast DFA to find out if the regular expressions are even slightly matching with the string, and only in this case possibly a dim back tracking match
 regular oxpraishan kaa aarambhik prayog ASCII aksharon ke saath hua
 Many regular expression engines can now work with full Unicode as well
 adhikansh maamalon main isamen koi antar nahin dikhataa ki aksharon kaa set kya he, lekin kuch maamalon main fark padataa he jab regular oxpraishan ko unicode par kaary karnaa padataa he

 is prithvi par jitne bhi jeev- jantu hai, unka nirmaan ek hi disha se hota aa rahaa he
 Whether they are bacteria, fungi, plants, lowland animals, or developed organisms like us, we are all connected by the same link
 yah he sharir ke sabase chote ansh, jinako ham cells yaa phir jivakoshikaayen kehete hai
 The entire body is full of cells
 hamaari in koshikaon kaa vartmaan rup hamaare vikaas k hi ek hissaa he
 Under every cell there is a chemical that handles all the functions of our body
 vah he dioxi ribo neucleic acid
 It is made up of two battles in animals like Hamas
 di en e hi vah rasinic he jo kii hamen duusare jantuon se alag karata he
 The DNA of humans is composed of about 3 billion base pairs, whose bases are adenyine, guanine, thiamine and cytosine
 yah rasinic bandha se jude rahete hai, jise ham hydrogen fidh kehete hai
 This maintains the stability of DNA
 agar kisi vajah se in aadhaar jodiyon main kuch badlaav aate hai, toh use ham muteshan kehete he
 We can currently divide some DNA changes into 6 classes
 yah he : If a new base pair occurs between two nucleotide base pairs, we call it a nucleotide combination
 yah tab hota he, jab di en e ke pratikruti ke dauraan, di en e paulimress thik se kaam nahi karata he, or ek nayaa base, dono ke bich main le aata he
 At the time of placement
 us duusare newcliotayid ke saath ek anay base jud jaataa he
 This changes the reading frame of the entire DNA, and starts the development of new probesins, causing a disturbance in the living body
 agar do newcliotide adhaar jodiyon ke bich main se mit jaaye, ek aadhaar jodi kisi vajah, to use ham newcliotide vilopan kehete he
 This happens when, during DNA replication, the DNA polymerase does not function properly, and a new base is moved between the two
 isse bhi sharir ke kaaphi saare proteins nasht ho jate hain kyonki reeding frem badal jaataa he
 Here one nucleotid base pair changes into another
 jaise e-tii bond ji-si bond ban jaataa he yaa iskaa ulataa bhi ho saktaa he
 This does not change the reading frame
 sirf ek amino acid kaa parivartan hota he
 In this, a purine group mutates into each other, forming an unstable bond, which is difficult to fix
 isame ek pureen group ek duusare group piridine ke aapas main badal jate hai, jisase ke phir se ek asthir bandha banataa he, jisko thik karnaa di en e polimress ke liye mushkil ho jaataa he
 If one of the four nucleotides is converted to enol by its normal keto form, then it becomes troublesome that any of the nucleotides can bind to each other and this can lead to disturbances in the formation of proteins
 agar koshikaon par parabangnee kirne padati hai, to, di en e main maujuud do thaimin naucliotids ke bich main ek saichlobuten ring ban jaati he
 This causes the DNA polymerase to work, and makes the DNA unstable
 zyaadaatar di en e kii kharabiyon ko, galat newcliotids ko nikaal kar sahi vaale lagaakar kiya jaataa he
 However, sometimes it is not possible to do so
 di en en marammt ke kul teen prkaar he : This method proves very efficient in some problems
 yah sirf unheen jagahon par kaam aata he, jahon har samay koi na koi badlaav hote rahete hai
 They are usually corrected with direct effusion or direct repair
 is prakriya ko photoriacteveshan kehete hai
 This is called this because the energy of light is enough to break the cyclobutane rings
 yah kshamta kaaphi praaniyon main uplabdh he, jaise ki ped-paudhe, amoeba, yeast or bacteria main yah uplabdh he
 The enzyme used in this process is photolysis
 yah di en e repere kaa ek bahut hi saamaanya madhyam he
 In this, the damaged DNA is identified and removed, whether it is nucleotide or in the form of bases
 iskaa ek udhaaharan he, di en e main se urossil kaa nikaala janaa, jiskaa bananaa ek mutagenic ghatana he
 DNA glycosylase is the enzyme that helps in performing this task
 iske chalate ek khaali urossil batch jaataa he
 DNA glycosylase also removes other abnormal bases
 ise newcliotoid excishan repere bhi kehete hai
 This change is useful when, instead of becoming a - t or g - c bond, some other bond is formed
 isame 3 proteins istamaal hote hai
 These are - Mute S, Mute l and Mute H
 is prakriya main mut es, di en e main asantulan dhundhata he
 At the site of imbalance, the mute l is released and the DNA is ejected

 He died in an accident during a bomb test
 bhagwati charan vohara kaa janm july 1903 main agra main hua tha
 His father Shiv Charan Vohra was a high official of the railway
 baad main ve agra se lahore chale aaye
 His family was financially prosperous
 bhagwati charan kii shiksha-diksha lahore main hui
 They were also married at an early age
 patni kaa naam durga tha
 Later, his wife also became an active partner in revolutionary work
 krantikario dwaara diya gaya " durga bhabhi " sanbodhan ek aam sanbodhan ban gaya
 During education at Lahore National College, Bhagwati Charan formed a study group of students, taking inspiration from the Russian Revolutionary
 raashtra kii paratantraa or usase mukti ke prashn par kendrit is adhyayan mandali main niyamit rup se shaamil hone waalo main bhagat singh, sukhdev aadi pramukh the
 Later these people established the Naujawan Bharat Sabha
 padhai ke dauraan 1921 main hi bhagwati charan gandhi ji ke aahvaan par padhai chhodkar asahyog aandolan main kud pade the
 Later, when the movement returned, he completed his college studies

 General secretary of this assembly was Bhagat Singh and Propaganda secretary Bhagwati Charan
 april 1928 main noujvaan bharat sabha kaa ghoshnaa patr prakashit hua
 Advice from Bhagat Singh and other companions - Bhagwati Charan Vohra's work was to prepare the Masavide in consultation
 noujvaan bharat sabha ke utkarsh main bhagwati charan or bhagat singh kaa hi pramukh haath tha
 Apart from Bhagat Singh, he was the principal theorist of the organization
 krantikari vichaarak, sanghathankarta, vaktaa, prachaarkarta, adarsh ke prati nishtha va pratibadhata tathaa uske liye aparaajey himmat - hausala aadi saare gun bhagwati charan main vidyaman the
 Bhagwati Charan was unmatched in completing a task with full enthusiasm

 Which he completed well
 baad ke daur main sanghathan ke saathiyo main bhagwati charan ke bare main yah andeh failaayaa gaya kii ve si0 ai 0 di0 ke aadmi he or usase tankhwaah pate hai
 Those people who came in the organization at the time behind the imposition of these allegations were not to risk any work
 isliye bhi ve log bahuaiami vyaktitv ke dhani bhagwati charan par aarope lagaakar na keval khud netritva main aana chaahate the
 Rather, they wanted to ban revolutionary actions
 aise logo kaa yah uddeshy bhi tha ki sanghathan ke kaam ko aapasi bahes, mubaahisa, prachaar or paisa jamaa karne ke kaam tak simit kar diya jaae
 The main gentleman among those who accused CID on Bhagwati Charan was Jayachandra Vidyalankar
 ve un dinon neshnal kalege ke adhyaaapak bhi the
 His position, knowledge and scholarship was also on the young revolutionary group
 bhagwati charan aise aaropon se beparwaah rahete hue krantikari kaaryo ko aage badhaane main lage rahete the
 He said that "it is their job to do what is right
" safai dena or naam kamanaa unka kaam nahi he

 But neither was ever caught nor did he step back from doing revolutionary works
 is baat kaa saboot yah he ki itane aaropon se ghire hone ke baad bhi bhagwati charan ne special train main baithe vysarai ko chalati train main hi uda dene kaa bharpoor prayaas kiya
 Yashpal, Indrapala, Bhagaram were his allies in this work
 maheene bhar kii taiyaari ke baad niyat tithi par guzarati special train ke neeche bam - bisphot karne main log kaamyaab bhi ho gayi

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class

 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture
 vaise bhi bhartiya jalwaayu or pashu-pakshiyon ke shabdon ke liye unani, latin, german or anya hind-europea bhashaaon main milte julate shabd nahin milte, jaise mor, murga, baagh, hathi, aam, kelaa, pipal, bargad, neem, garm-mausam, ganda, bhens, chaaval, ityadi

 nagaraj raaj comics kii peshkash, ek bhartiya comic book kirdaar he jise yaqinan lambey samay se jivit bhartiya ection comic super hero kaha ja saktaa he
 Created by Sanjay Gupta in the late 1980s, Nagraj has drastically changed both the look as well as the story in his 25 years of life
 is tathy ke baavjood ki kisi samay bharat main comic samskruti lagbhag gaayab ho gai thi, phir bhi uske prashansak aadhaar main vruddhi hui or uski pehali anemated film ke jari hone ke baad isamen jabardast badhotaree kii ummid he
 The first issue of Nagaraja was written by the well-known writer Parashuram Sharma and was illustrated by Pratap Malik
 malik ne 1995 tak lagbhag 50 ankon ke liye is charitra kaa safaltaapurvak chithran kiya tha
 From 1995 onwards, illustration was taken over by illustrator and writer Anupam Sinha
 aaj nagaraj jo kuch bhi he, vah bhartiya comic udyog ke in diggaj pratap malik or anupam sinha kii vajah se he
 The character of Nagaraja is believed to be inspired by the mythical wishful serpent, the historical venomous human
 uski kahaniyon main puraana, kalpana, jaadu or vigyaan galp kaa samrudh mishran he
 Many fans of Nagaraja believe that over time Nagaraja comics have developed a serpent myth of their own which is unique to popular Indian beliefs about snakes among the masses
 nagaraj kii multah kalpana antarrashtriya aatankwaad ke ek dushman ke rup main kii gai thi
 Interestingly, in its first issue, Nagaraj was promoted as an international terrorist weapon by the evil scientist Professor Nagmani
 nagaraj ko is pehle mishan main adivasee bhakton, sanpon or rahasyamay 300 se bhi zyaada umr ke gorakhnath baba naamak buudhe sadhu se sangrakshit ek mandir se devi kii murti churaane kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha
 Nagaraja succeeded in his task, but was defeated against Gorakhnath and his mysterious black mongoose Shikangi
 gorakhnath ne uskaa man pard liya or pataa lagaaya ki profosar naagamani ne nagaraj ko apane niyantran main rakhane ke liye uske sir main ek capsule ke rup main man ko niyantrit karne vaale yantra kaa pratyaropan kiya he
 Gorakhnath underwent surgery and removed the capsule from Nagaraj's head, freeing Nagraj from the control of Professor Nagmani
 iske baad nagaraj baba gorakhnath kaa shishy ban gaya or usne prithvi se aparaadh or aatankwaad ko khatm karne kii qasam khai
 tab se nagaraj ne teen baar vishwa kaa daura kiya or kai khalnaayakon or aatankwaadiyon ko haraaya
 Samprati Nagraj in a fictional city metropolis with his own secretly owned TV
 The channel's employee is living as Raj
 pracheen kaal main jab devtaa bina kisi pratibandh ke prithvi par vicharan karte the, tab vahaan takshaknagar naamak ek samrajya maujuud tha jis par raja takshakraj or rani lalita kaa shashan tha
 The ruling couple had no concern except one; They did not have any child
 rajkumaar yaa rajkumaari kii anupasthiti ne ekmaatr nagapasha ko uskaa sambhavit vaaris banaaya
 nagapasha samraat kaa samroop chota bhai tha, jo yah jaanakar ki keval vahi singhaasana kaa sambhavit uttaradhikari he, chintarahit bhavy jivan jeene laga tha
 As time passed, the queen became depressed due to the absence of her child
 The king understood the reason for the depression of the queen and they also started being upset
 The husband and wife used to worship their family deity Dev Kalajayi for Ashish
 dev kaaljayi ko bhi unke dukh kaa kaaran pataa tha, atah ek din unhone mahaan santan paane kaa unhen aashirwad diya
 Her blessing was successful and soon the queen became pregnant and a wave of happiness ran across the state except for Nagpash
 is santan ke janm kaa matlab uske liye singhaasana khona tha, atah bachche ke paidaa hone se pehle hi use maarane kaa usne nirnay liya
 One day while Rani Dev was going to worship Kalajayi, Nagpash replaced Prasad with a dead mongoose in a covered plate of the deity's offering
 nagdevataa ko gussa aa gaya or unhone apni vifailli saans se rani ko behosh kar diya
 The king apologizes to the deity and begs to cure his wife but the deity refuses to do so, after which desperate Raj attempts to commit suicide
 bhakt kii mrityu jhelane main aksham, dev kaaljayi ne unhen rani kii jaan bachaane kaa ek upaay bataaya
 unhone raja ko mani di or use rani kii dawa se abhikriya karne ke liye kaha
 mani rani ke sharir se sara vish bachche ke sharir kii ore palat degaa, lekin vish ke bure prabhaav ke kaaran rani apni prajnan kshamta kho degi
 Mourning prevailed throughout the kingdom and the king also became unhappy
 nagapasha bahut khush tha ki vah akele vaaris ke rup main batch gaya he
 When the child was born, everyone thought that he was dead because his whole body was blue and no signs of life were seen in it
 hinduon kii pratha ke anusaar navjaat shishu ko nadi main phenk diya gaya
 Nagpash happily woke up and went straight to the drunken Dev Kalajayi and asked him to hand over the royal treasury, stating that he was the sole heir to the throne and hence he had authority over the royal treasury
 dev kaaljayi ne inkaar kar diya or usase kaha ki singhaasana kaa "asli uttaradhikari" jivit he or jab samay aae tab khajaana use saunp diya jayega
 naaraaz hokar nagapasha ne devtaa ke viruddh apni talwaar uthaai lekin vishaal saanp kii poonch ke maatr jatke se dur ja gira
 nagapasha do katoron par gira, ek main behad jaharila vish tha, jisane uske chehre ko nasht kar diya gaya or uske khun main mil gaya or duusare main amrit tha, jisane use amar bana diya
 The simultaneous influence of the two made Nagpash an immortal venomous man
 us samay nagapasha apane sharir ke badlaav ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or behosh ho gaya
 When Dev Kalajayi informed the king about these events, he came to know that his son was not dead and he also realized the possible dangers towards his life
 atah unhone tilism ke mahaan gyani apane vafaadaar jyotishi vedacharya ko aadesh diya ki ve khazaane ko aise tilism main sangrakshit karen, jise keval unka betaa tod sake
 vedacharya ne dev kaaljayi ke sahyog se tilism taiyaar kiya taaki sunishchit ho ki sivaay raja ke bete ke koi us tilism ko todane main sakasham na ho, amar nagapasha bhi nahin
 jab nagapasha ko hosh aayaa to usne mahasoos kiya ki vah khajaana kho chukaa he
 Angry, he killed the king and queen
 jivan-kriya rahit sthiti main shishu nadi main bahata hua jhaadiyon main jaakar funs gaya
 He stayed there for a long time
 is bich sarp devtaa dev kaaljayi chiraayu ichhadhari naagon ke shaasha raja maniraj or unki patni manika rani ke sapanom main prakat hue, jo maanviya drushti se ojhal nagadweep naamak hind mahaasaagar ke ek dweep main chhip kar jivan bitaa rahe the
 He told the baby's location and asked them to treat him
 He did as he was told and found the baby, and he also came to know that he was more toxic than the great serpent Mahatma, the island's great serpent, indicating that he possessed the divine poison of God
 shuru main raaj vaidya anishchit the ki ve shishu kaa ilaaj kar paaenge yaa nahin, lekin swayan dev kaaljayi ne raja se ilaaj ke liye kaha tha isliye ve aashwast hue ki unka upachaar safal hoga
 niyamon ke anusaar, kisi ko bhi is dweep main kisi bahari vyakti ko laane kii anumati nahin thi, isliye raja ne uski upasthiti ko gupt rakhane kaa faisalaa liya
 Many years passed and the results of the treatment started to appear, although there was still no life-activity in it, but the color of the baby gradually started changing to green
 The king gave this news to the queen and they decided to adopt the child as they had no children of their own
 unke nirnay ko dusht tantric vishandhar ne sun liya jo dweep kaa shaasha bananaa chahta tha, lekin mahatma kaldoot se darataa tha
 He attacked the secret area where the infant was kept and ran away with him, but fearing the wrath of God decided not to kill the infant and placed him back in the river bushes where he was found
 uski yojana vifal hui kyonki jald hi rani ne garbh dhaaran kiya or ek beti ko janm diya, jiskaa naam visarpi rakhaa gaya
 Vyasandhar never realized that the baby he had left to wander came to his senses, first his face and then his body like normal humans and he started crying
 paas ke mandir ke ek pujari ne use dekha or use profesar naagamani ko bhent swaroop diya jo paas ke jangal main sanpon kii talash main bhatak rahaa tha
 For unknown reasons, Purohit tells a false story that the infant is of a woman who was raped and who was a devotion to the serpent god and that the child is blessed to become a willful serpent and requested Nagamani to raise him something In such a way that he can avenge his mother
 naagamani ne samaj liya ki pujari jhooth bol rahe hai lekin vah shishu ko apane saath le gaya
 The baby's blood test showed that his white blood cells contained microscopic snakes instead of blood
 shishu main asaadhaaran rogahar shaktiyaan thi or vah atyant vishaiylla tha
 He raised a child who later became Nagraj
 nagaraj ko naagamani profesar kii ek sristi ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh prastut kiya gaya
 He was being made a unique assassin machine and his original plan was to hire Nagraj as the highest bidder among villains and terrorist groups around the world
 profesar naagamani ne apane anya praayogic pariyojnaon or antarrashtriya aatankwaad ke liye patte par uskaa istemaal kiya
 Nagmani always claimed that his powers were developed by giving Nagaraja parts of the snake venom, poisoning him
 unhone daawa kiya ki uskaa vish 1000 vibhinn prajatiyon ke saanp ke kaatane kaa parinaam he or uski shaktiyaan mrit ichhadhari naag ke bhasma se ilaaj se viksit hui hai
 The fact was that Nagaraja was more poisonous than any snake species, because his venom was supernatural
 mote taur par aakaar badalane vaale hindu myth ke aadhaar par, nagaraj apni rakt koshikaon main palane vaale sookshm sanpon se shakti paata tha or use vifailli saans vish-phunkaar or kaat, tatkaal upachaar shaktiyaan or uski kalai se alag se nikalne vaale yaa rassiyaan, parachute tathaa uski kalpana ke anusaar vibhinn aakaar grahan karne vaale sanpon jaisi asankhya alokik shaktiyaan praapt hai
 It is believed that if he bites someone or someone bites him, then his venom has the power to smelt the body of any living animal, even sharper than potassium cyanide
 apane pehle mishan ke liye, use das lakh main bechaa gaya tha or uddeshy ek pracheen pratimaa ko hasil karnaa tha
 Nagaraja succeeds, but then the monk "baba Gorakhnath" fails him, freeing his mind from the control of "professor Nagamani"
 gorakhnath kii ek nai shanti kii duniya main jaag kar, nagaraj vishwa se aatankwaad ko samaapt karne kii qasam khaataa he or apana lakshya hasil karne kii disha main aage badhata he
 Nagaraj's powers were also limited in the early numbers, sometimes he was defeated by powerful human opponents and temporarily fainted, his strength was also very human like that of his opponents seeing a car picker
 Was taken aback by the power of barason baad nagaraj itnaa shaktishaalee ho gaya ki vah na keval akele girti hui kaaron ko tham letaa tha balki aasaani se chizon ko bahya antariksh main phenk detaa tha
 It is notable and perhaps even ironic that Nagaraja is now transformed into a mythological-magical creature who has to face fantastical creatures as his enemies, including elements of witchcraft and time and space travel
 Huh
 kai log ise nagaraj comics kii nirantar, jabardast lokapriyata main vruddhi ke kaaran ke rup main dekhte hai
 However, purists still claim that they prefer more realistic and more practical stories from which Nagaraja originated
 nagaraj yakeenan raaj jagat kaa sabase adhik shaktishaalee super hero he or apane samay kaa sabase shaktishaalee ichhadhari naag
 baar-baar, usne sheshnag, vasukidev, kaaljayi mahaan sarp devataaon ko chunauti dene kii kshamta dikhaai he or kaldoot, triphana, mahavyal or sheetanag kumaar jaise naagon ko parrast kiya he, jo apni prajati ke sabase taqatvar naagon main gine jate hai
 Nagaraja in his early numerals was a wanderer who, like an avalanche, wreaked havoc for the enemies of mankind
 chunki chhadam vyaktitv kii zarurat nahin thi, nagaraj ke paas koi maujuud nahin tha, lekin vah apni pahchaan chhipaane ke liye khud ko ek overkot main or aksar ek topi se chipa detaa tha
 The costume he used to disguise his true identity, he was given the name of disguise by his fans because often no one came to know that the person standing before him was Nagraj himself
 nagaraj ne apane naveenatam vaishvik aatankwaad series main isi chhadam vyaktitv ko apanaaya he
 Nagaraj takes off his hat and overcoat in public immediately due to fear of not being identified in an emergency
 uskaa vigat chhadam vyaktitv tha raaj, jo kahani main prastut kaalpanik company bharti communications main anaadi kism kaa sampark adhikari tha
 He pretends to be afraid of snakes, in his secret identity
 vah chashma or theth bijnes suut pahentaa he tathaa bahut hi darpok or saral vyakti he
 It is very similar to the character of Superman / Clark Kent, whose costumes, hair sorting and the use of goggles to disguise themselves are similar
 haalanki praarambhik chhadam vyaktitv fatum par aadhaarit tha, yah chhadam vyaktitv superman par aadhaarit he
 Recently forced to reveal his true identity in the series "after Nagraj", Nagaraja had to change his pseudo personality again due to circumstances
 He now works as the manager of the new security agency "snake Eyes" according to the current storyline
 uskaa nayaa naam he nagaraj singh
 yah sushri saudangi ke swaamitv main he jo uske sharir main rahati he or ichhadhari naag he
 In Nagaraj comics, innumerable enemies of Nagaraja have appeared, many were killed, but some survived to reappear
 Here is a list of the major surviving enemies of Nagraj, who can be expected to return in future scores: apane karmon se nagaraj ne kai dost banaae, jinamein kai keval ek baar dikhaai die, kuch anek baar or bahut kam uski kahaniyon main jagah banaate hue, yada-kada prakat hote hue sthai kirdaar ban gaye
 Here is a list of well-known characters in his issue: nagaraj ko ek live ection tii

 It is believed that many of the modern-day Tajik, Pashtun and Yagnobi people are descendants of these Sogdai people
 dhyaan dijiye kii 'sonda' main 'ga' kaa uccharan 'ga' se thodaa alag he
 The people of Sogda were considered freedom-loving and militant and their nation was situated between the Hakhamani kingdom of Iran and the Shakas

 From this region, trade between China and the regions of the west started increasing again
 sonda resham maarg par aa gaya or soudai log jor-shor se vyapaar main lag gaye
 Sogdai language became the language of trade in Central Asia and many non-sogdai also started learning and speaking it

 a nuclear weapon or nuclear bomb is an explosive device whose base of destructive power is nuclear reaction
 yah nabhikeey sanlayan yaa nabhikeey vikhandan yaa in dono prakaar kii nabhikeey abhicriyon ke sammilan se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Both types of reaction result in huge amount of energy from very few materials
 aaj kaa ek hajaar kilo se thodaa bada nabhikeey hathiyaar itani urja utpann kar saktaa he jitani kai arab kilo ke paramparaagat visphotakon se hi utpann ho sakati he
 Nuclear weapons are known as destructive weapons
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main sabase adhik shaktishaalee visphotak, jo prayukt hua tha, uskaa naam 'blockbster' tha
 In its construction, 11 tons of the most widely known explosive trinitrotoluene was used till then
 is visphotak se 2000 guna adhik shaktishaalee pratham parmaanu bam tha jiskaa visphot tii
 en
 tii
 ke 22,000 ton ke visphot ke baraabar tha
 Now more powerful atomic bombs have been made than the first atomic bomb
 parmaanu bam main visphutit hone vaala padaarth uranium yaa plutonium hota he
 Power is achieved only by nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium
 iske liye parmaanu ke cendrak main neutron se prahaar kiya jaataa he
 a very large amount of energy is obtained from this stroke
 is prakram ko bhautik vigyaani nabhikeey vikhandan kehete hai
 Neutrons are free from the neutrons in the interior of the atom's nucleus
 ye neutron anya parmaanuon par prahaar karte hai or unase phir vikhandan hota he
 They then fission other atoms
 is prakaar shrunkhlaa kriyaayein aarambh hoti hai
 The uncontrolled series of atomic bombs result in the explosion of the atom with great intensity
 uranium ke kai samasthanik gyaat hai
 Normal uranium contains 99
3 percent U-238 and 0
7 percent U-235
 you-238 kaa vikhandan utani saralata se nahin hota jitani saralata se you-235 kaa vikhandan hota he
 U-235 has three neutrons less than U-238
 neutron kii is kami ke kaaran hi you-235 kaa vikhandan saralata se hota he
 Other fissile materials used in atomic bombs are U-233 and plutonium-239
 parmaanu visphot ke liye vikhandaneey padaarth kii kranthik sanhati aavashyak hoti he
 Critical code is the minimum amount of current for a chain action
 yadi vikhandaneey padaarth kii maatra kranthik sanhati se kam he to neutron keval dhurradhurr karata rahegaa
 Increasing the volume slowly will create a time when at least one free neutron strikes a new atom and breaks it down
 aisi sthiti pahunchne par vikhandan kriya swat: chalane lagati he
 The volume of the Revolutionary Code is confidential
 jo raashtra parmaanu bam banaate he ve hi jaanate hai or dusron ko batalaate nahin
 If the critical code of the U-235 is 20 pounds, then the series action will not start by taking ten to ten pounds two
 20 pound ko ek saath lene se hi shrunkhlaakriya chaalu hogi
 The number of neutrons in the chain increases very quickly
 parmaanu bam main vikhandan se uranium or use nikatavarti anya padaarthon kaa taap badi shighrata se upar uthta he
 Metallic uranium transforms into incandescent gas at high pressure and temperature
 visphotak pind kaa taap 10,00,00,000° se
 tak uth jaataa he
 At such a high temperature, the uranium plate is removed
 tab sara pind badi prachandta se visphutit hota he
 Atomic bombs erupt and produce half-waves that propagate around at speeds greater than the speed of sound
 jab parmaanu bam ko prithvital ke upar visphutit kiya jaataa he to tarangen prithvital se takaraakar upar uthati hai or nayaa aghat utpann karti hai jo upar or neeche tivrata se failata he
 The center of the bomb blast immediately warms and produces vacuum
 nirvaat bharne ke liye aasapaas kii thandi hawaayen daudti he
 In this way they are broken by atomic bombs hitting homes
 visphoti uranium anya tatwon main badal jaataa he, usase radio actevedhi kirane nikalakar jivit koshikaon ko aakraant kar unhen nasht kar detii hai
 The destructive function of the bomb is due to shock waves, piercing rays and excessive heat production
 hydrogen bam parmanubam kaa ek kism he
 a hydrogen bomb or H-bomb is a more powerful atomic bomb
 isamen hydrogen ke samasthanik du tirium or tritirium kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Fusion of atoms causes the bomb to explode
 is sanlayan ke liye bade unche, taap, lagbhag 500,00,000° sein
 kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This temperature is much higher than the temperature of the sun's hottest part
 parmaanu bam dwaara hi itnaa unchaa taap praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 America, England, Russia, China and India tested hydrogen bombs
 mana ja rahaa ha ki uttar korea ne bhi esa khatarnaak bam banaaya he
 Hydrogen atoms are absorbed only when the atomic bomb produces the required heat
 is sanlayan se ooshmaa or shaktishaalee kirane utpann hoti hai jo hydrogen ko helium main badal detii hai
 In 1922 AD, it was first discovered that the explosion of hydrogen atom can generate a lot of energy
 1932 main duterium naamak baari hydrogen kaa or 1934 i
 main tritirium naamak baari hydrogen kaa avishkaar hua
 In 1950, the President of the United States of America, Tru Man, ordered the preparation of a hydrogen bomb
 iske liye 1951 i
 main south carolina main ek bade kaarkaane kii sthapana hui
 In 1953 AD, President Eisenhuber announced that a hydrogen bomb equivalent to millions of tons of TNT had been prepared
