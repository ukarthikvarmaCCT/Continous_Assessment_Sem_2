 Both were organized by Jamaican leaders: the Federal Labor Party of the West Indies by Norman Manley and the Democratic Labor Party by Alexander Bustamante

 a small third party, the Federal Democratic Party, was founded in November 1957 by a group in Trinidad, although the party failed to win a single seat
 donon pramukh rashtriya dalon ke liye kai minon main platform samaan the
 Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada: the emphasis on encouraging and expanding tourism; In order to obtain loans, for financial assistance and technical assistance, insisted on trying to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Union

 The WIFLP advocated the promotion of agriculture, while the DLP promised a favorable climate for both private industry and the development of labor, human and economic resources
 dabluelpi ne bahama ko sangh main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit karne kaa vaada kiya, jabaki dlapi ne nahin kiya
 The WIFLP also campaigned for the establishment of a central bank to expand credit resources and advocated complete internal self-government for a democratic socialist society and all unit territories, while avoiding issues of the independence movement and a custom union

 The WIFLP received the bulk of the seats from the smaller islands, while the DLP received a majority in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
 dlapi ne jamaica main 11 siton or trinidad main 6 siton main jeet hasil kii
 While appointing the Senate, the Governor General Lord Hales realized that only the St
 Vincent Island government was controlled by the DLP, with the result that the Senate was going to the disproportionately WIFLP
 ek vivaadaaspad faisle main unhone jamaica or trinidad main vipaksh dlapi samoohon se sampark kiya or un dwipon main se prayek se ek dlapi seenetter niyukt kiya he
 Thus the Senate consisted of 15 WIFLP members and 4 DLP members

 Similarly, Jamaican founder Alexander Bustamante of DLP also declined to contest the union and left the party leadership for Trinidadian Ashford Sinanan

 The federal structure of the West Indies Union was unusually weak
 udhaaharan ke liye, iske praant ek ekal custom union main shaamil nahin the
 Thus, each province was acting as a separate economy with tariffs, mainly because smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the economies of the larger island
 iske alaava, sangh ke bheetar andolan kii puri swatantraaa ko lagu nahin kiya gaya, kyonki bade praant chote dwipon se bade paimaane par palaayan ke bare main chintit the
 In this sense, it can be said that the current European Union has implemented a more integrated economic environment than the West Indian effort

 The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were both larger than the federal budget
 iske chalate un rajyon se sangheey sarkaar ke liye adhik se adhik vitt poshan pradaan ke anurodhon ko doharaaya gaya
 These requests were ignored because both Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago had already contributed about 85 percent of federal revenue, roughly in equal parts

 Unlike other Westminster systems with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of the West Indian Union could not dissolve Parliament

 In the early years, many Caribbean leaders suggested that the West Indies Union should investigate the possibility of becoming a Canadian province, though it was never more than a fleeting one
 vaarta ke khandit hone ke baavjood, may 1961 main canada ne kshetra ke do sabase mahatvapurn uphaar ko westeindies sangh ko prastut kiya: do vyapaaree jahaaj, jiskaa naam da fedral palm or ga fedral mapel tha
 These two ships visited each island twice a month in the federation and provided an important maritime contact between the islands
 sangh ke samaapt hone ke liye kai kaarnon ko ginaya gaya he, unamem se kuch ko upar "samasya" anubhag main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 This included lack of local public support, competitive insular nationalism, weakness of federal government, curb on federal taxation and freedom of movement, lack of federal constitution, fundamental changes to constitution at the beginning of its existence, political quarrels among influential leaders
 , The three most influential leaders decide not to participate in the federal election, the two largest units are Population and Resources The impact of heavy concentration, geographic and cultural distance between the units, lack of history of public administration and self-state period s who was standing by the Crown Colony system
 haalaanki, sangh ke vighatan ke liye tatkaal utprerak jamcon asantosh tha
 By 1961, Jamaica had a number of reasons for dissatisfaction with the state of affairs: jamaica ke asantusht hone kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaaran sangh kii aupniveshik sthiti kaa jari rahanaa tha
 Jamaica joined the Union because its leaders believed that the West Indies would soon be given independence
 sangh ke gathan ke lagbhag teen saal baad bhi aisa nahin hua tha, isi bich, chote british upnivesh jaise cyprus or siyara leone ne swatantraaa praapt kar lee thi
 Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island should seek independence from its authority and this could happen
 saath hi sangh dwaara prastaavit rajdhani chaugaaramasa ke saath bhi samasyaayein thi, us samay vah sanyukt rajya ke haathon main tha 
 Many leaders of the Caribbean province wanted Chaguramas as the capital of the Confederacy
 kshetreey netaa jaise, jamaica ke norman manale or dow erik williams ne chaugaaramas ko sanyukt rajya se chhudaa kar sangh ko saunpe jane kii vakaalat kii
 However, the United States and Britain disagreed, and the Prime Minister of the Federation, Grantley Adams, refused provincial leaders to obtain Chaugaramas
 kai jamikans ko tab laga ki sangh unki vikaas prakriya or swatantraaa andolan ko baadhit kar rahaa he
 As a result, the Jamaican Labor Party, led by Bustamante, successfully forced Manley to hold a referendum in September 1961 over political isolation from the Union
 us samay ke prantiy pradhanmantri manale ke virodh ke baavjood, 54 pratishat vot ke saath ise paarit kar diya gaya
 Manley himself was defeated in the island elections of April 1962 and Bustamante became the first Prime Minister of independent Jamaica on 6 August 1962
 jamaica ke jane ke baad, puraane malbe se ek nayaa mahasang khadaa karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 For this, there was considerable reliance on Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who said in the past that he wanted a "strong union"
 antigua ke pradhanmantri ware bird ne jawaab diya ki sangh main unka praant trinidad ke baraabar kaa hissedaar he, "ek chote se tobago" kii tarah nahi he
 He indicated that a strong federation was acceptable provided no attempt was made to create a unitary state
 is nae sangh par vaarta sitambar 1961 main shuru hui; haalaanki, unhone sanket diya ki trinidad ko 75 se 80 pratishat tak nae mahasang kaa rajasav pradaan karnaa hoga
 Furthermore, even though Trinidad now represents 60 percent of the new union's population, the resolution under consideration had to be given less than half the seats in Parliament
 november tak, williams ne sanket diya ki ab vah ek ekaatmak rajya banane ke vichaar ke paksh main he
 Failing that, he resolved to take independence to Trinidad and Tobago
 jiske tahat 4 disambar 1961 ko unhen ek trinidadian netaa ke rup punarnirvachan dwaara simit kiya gaya
 Later in December, Barbados Prime Minister Errol Barrow met with Williams, but failed to persuade him to keep Trinidad in the Union
 14 janvari,1962 ko naishanal pipuls movement ne sangh ke saath kisi bhi aage kii bhagidaari ko khaarij karne ke prastaav ko paarit kiya
 Williams himself stated that "if we remove one out of ten, only zero remains" In other words, without Jamaica, union was not possible
 trinidad or tobago ko 31 agast 1962 ko swatantraaa mili
 Without Trinidad and Jamaica, the remaining "little Eight" attempted to retain some form of West Indies union, this time focused on Barbados

 is kriti kii viral visheshta yah he ki 'amoort'ko ek atyadhik sookshm samvednaatmak shabdaawalee dekar nai utsaah parakh jijeevishaa ko vaani di he
 While on the other hand, Kunvarnarayan ji has interpreted the subject like death in self-respect, on the contrary, in the 'under the pretext of Vajashrava', he has highlighted the light of life with his legislative compassion
