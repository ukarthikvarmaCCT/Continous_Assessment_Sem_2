 Functionalism mainly highlights two things - what do people do? And why do people behave? According to Woodworth, the psychology that seeks answers to both these questions is called functionalism
 prakaaryawad main chetana ko uske vibhinn tatwon ke rup main vishleshan karne par bal nahin daalaa jaataa balki isamen maansik kriya yaa anukool vyavhaar ke adhyayan ko mahatv diya jaataa he
 Favorable behavior basically involves study of direct memory, emotion, judgment and desire etc
 as these processes help the person to adjust to the environment

 EL Tharndike and RS Woodworth contributed the most among the Colombian activists
 tharnadike ne ek pustak 'shiksha manovigyaan' likhi jisamen inhone seekhney ke niyam likhe hai
 According to Thorndike, psychology is the science of the study of stimulus-response relations
 tharnadike ne seekhney ke liye sambandhwaad kaa siddhanth diya, jiske anusaar seekhney main prarambh main trutiyaan adhik hoti he kintu abhyaas dene se in trutiyon main dhire-dhire kami aa jaati he
 Woodworth, like other functionalists, considered psychology a science of the study of conscious and behavior
 inhone seekhney kii prakriya ko kaaphi mahatvapurn bataaya kyonki isse yah pataa chalata he ki seekhney kii prakriya kyon kii gayi
 Woodworth considered the role of the creature as important, while making changes in the relation of the continent-response, and said that it is important to have the reaction of the creature-response

 The definition of mutation has been given in many ways, but the conclusion of all is that it is a type of genetic change

 Altenberg has attributed the gradual alleged mutation to the modern high speed of race horses

 In many instances, this mutation can also cause a decrease in the speed of horses
 at: nishkarsh yahi nikalataa he ki utparivartan "manamaana parivartan" hota he

 a satisfactory explanation of why mutations occur is not available with biologists
 haan, in logon ne kuch aisi vidhiyaan nikaali hai, jinke dwaara kritrim yaa aropit dhang se utparivartan kiye ja sakate hai
 The alleged mutation can always be caused by external factors, which we can classify in the following categories: - 1
 tapakram-janankoshikaon main sahanbindu tak tapakram main vruddhi kar di jaae to utparivartan kii gati bad jaaegi
 2
 Mutation rate can be increased by using chemical-mustard oil smoke, formaldehyde peroxide, nitrous acid etc
 3

 alleged mutation utparivartan kii paribhaasha karte hue batalaaya gaya he ki utparivartan kisi spishiz ke anuvanshik padaarth main utpann gatisheel rasinic parivartan kaa naam he
 These changes occur in the structure and number of chromosomes
 at: is drushti se kisi jin kii aanvik sanrachana parivartan ko "jin utparivartan" kahenge
 However, when such changes are reflected in a particular or a fragment of a chromosome, they will be called "point mutations"
 vastut: in donon prakaar ke parivartanon main koi vishesh bhed nahin hota, at: in donon padon kaa paryaay, roopon main ullekh kiya gaya he
 Mutations are instantaneous, so they are also called "instantaneous mutations"
 bindu utparitarvan ati sookshm hote hai or unka prabhaav sampurna jeev parivartan par nahin padataa
 Hence the term mutation is generally used for point mutation only
 kisi manushya kii janan koshika main jin utparivartan hone par yah uske yugmanaj main sthanantarit ho jaataa he or is prakaar in cobikaon dwaara utpann nai peedi tak pahunch jaataa he
 As a result of numerous cell-divisions, mutation genes also become effective for a particular trait or trait, producing their own copies
 prabhavi utparitarwanon ko unki vaahak koshikaon main sthit gunasutron yaa jeenon main saraltapurvak dhunda ja saktaa he
 But such mutations are less visible than latent mutations
 parantu jahaan tak manushya main hue utparivartanon kaa prashn he, aise utparivartan adhiktar prabhavi ho batalaaye gaye hai
 Gender-associated mutations are more common in heterozygous males because they contain dominant sex-linked genes
 at: nar janakon ke prasupt utparivartan dwitiya peedi kii nar santanon main hi dikhalaai dete hai
 Most of the sex-linked mutations of humans have been considered latent
 ubhayyalingashrayi padpon main bahudhaa drushtigochar hote hai
 If ineffective mutations occur in the gonads, then future offspring will be heterozygous
 alingsutri aprabhavi utparivartan ek baar jab utpann ho jate hai, to kai pidiyon tak dikhalaai hi nahin dete
 But if these mutations are sex-linked, they become effective in the next generation itself
 pranaghatak utparivartanon ko adhiktar aprabhavi yaa prasupt mana jaataa he
 If the fatal mutations enter the gonads, then the future progeny will be heterozygous
 yadi aise utparivartan anda denevaale jantuon main ho jaaen to vishamyugmaji janakon ke lagbhag 1
 Only 4 eggs will not produce children
 lagbhag itani hi santatiyaan bhrounik parivardhan kii vividh dashaon main, janm ke samay athwa janm lene ke tatkaal baad mar jaayengi
 Malignant mutations are commonly visible in the alingosomes and can occur in any of these chromosomes
 samayugmaji murgi ke bhrun ke gunasutron main yadi ghaatak jin hon to aisi santati kaa kankal kurup yaa tedha medhaa hoga or vah janm ke purv hi mar gai hogi
 But children are born from heterozygous fractions and live, even if their asperities are crooked
 aise bacchon kii kreeper foul kehete hai, kyonki murgi ke in bacchon ke pair or qamar thingne hote hai
 In rare instances, inverted mutations also occur
 kabhi-kabhi utparivartit jin anek pidiyon tak vartmaan rah jaataa or ek hi kul ke sahasron sadasyon main failaa hota he
 However, when a gene in a member's gonad suddenly mutates to a normal ineffective allelic, another mutation occurs in such a situation
 is prakaar ke punarutparivartan ko pratilom utparivartan kii sangya pradaan kii gai he
 This leads to the conclusion that the patient condition of the mutation may change back to normal
 bacteria main kuch utparivartit dashaayen aisi bhi hoti hai jinamein ve vitamin banane kii kshamta kho baithte he
 But after some time they start producing vitamins again

 Body mutations are usually only visible in body tissues
 kayik utparivartanon kaa prabhaav dirghakaalik nahin hota
 Rashes occur in the body due to mutations occurring in the primary stages of the debilitated state
 vaigyanikon kaa mat he ki cancer bhi ek prakaar kaa kayik utparivartan hi he
 The eyes of a Drosophila fly are usually red, but may also show white spots or complete whiteness in one eye
 aisi mackhiyon ko mojeyk kaha jaataa he
 Several examples of such mutations can be given
 vaigyanikon ne prayogon dwaara pataa lagaaya he ki utparivartanon par parivesh kaa prabhaav teen prakaar se padataa he, tapakram dwaara, katipay rasayanon dwaara or kirann dwaara
 Temperature: The effect of temperature on mutation, most experiments have been done on the fly fly, Drosophila
 ek aise hi prayog main jab lingasahalagn aprabhavi ghaatak jeenon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya to pataa chalaa ki 14 degree sein
grey

087 pratishat, 22 degree sein
grey
 par 0
188 pratishat or 28 degree sein
grey
 par 0
325 pratishat ghaatak jin utpann hue
 One thing is clear from this that if the temperature increases even by 10 degrees, the rate of mutation doubles or triples
 is prasang main ek manoranjak baat yah bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki tapakram main vruddhi dwaara hi nahin, apitu atishay nunata dwaara bhi utparivartan prabhaav pad saktaa he
 Keeping the eggs of the Drosophila millenogaster for three days at -6 degrees heat, it was observed that within 25 to 40 minutes the rate of lethal mutations in their x and II chromosomes tripled
 astu, yah vicitra baat he ki sheet tathaa taap main atishay vruddhi kaa lagbhag ek samaan hi prabhaav padataa he
 There is not much light on why this happens
 utparivartan par rasinic prabhaav ke falon kaa adhyayan anek prakaar se kiya gaya he
 Several methods have been attempted to increase the mutation rate by chemical reagents
 is prasang main overbash or rabasan dwaara abhi haal main hi kiye gaye prayogon dwaara gyaat hua he ki sarson kaa dhuaan atyadhik prabhavakaari utparivartak madhyam he
 On observing the effect of smoke given in appropriate amounts in adult Drosophila, it was found that this increases the mutation rate by more than 10 percent
 sarson ke dhuen ke atirikt anek parakiden, farmelene, parmenganet, urithane, caffeine aadi bhi utparivartan dar main vruddhi karne vaale pramanit hue hai
 Apart from mustard and peroxides, the effects of other chemicals were relatively rare
 duusari kami inamen yah bhi pai gai ki inkaa prabhaav sutrovibhaajan ke vishesh charnon main yaa parivartan kii vishesh dishaao main hi drushtigochar hota he
 Similarly, some chemicals affect only the male and not the female
 iskaa kaaran yah batalaaya gaya he ki jab tak koi rasayan koshika ke cendrak aavaran kii bhedakar bheetar tak nahin pahunch jaataa, tab tak uskaa prabhaav sandigdh hi hoga; duusare, bahari rasayan kii koshikadravya hi yadi nishprabhavit kar degaa, to uskaa prabhaav to hoga hi nahin
 Irradiation or radiation - on the possibility of mutation by H
J
 Muller did some experiments in 1927
 unhone drosophila par eks-kirnon kaa prakshepan karke anek prakaar ke utparivartan utpann karne main safalataa praapt kii
 Since then till now, CLB method is also known to study the effects of irradiation on maize, barley, cotton, chuhia etc

 Later, his disciple Oliver conducted more experiments and presented a variety of facts
 eks-kirnon kaa prabhaav itnaa adhik isliye padataa he ki ve gunasutron ko bhang kar detii hai, jinase bhanti bhanti ke prabhaav drushtigochar hote hai
 These include transfer inversion, deletion duplication, etc
 sach puuchhie to kirann, chaahe vah kisi bhi prakaar kaa ho, tabhi utparivartan karata he, jab usamen aayan utpann karne kii kshamta ho
 For example, three types of radiation are produced in radium

 Ultraviolet light - Altenvarg has conducted experiments on the mutagenic effects of ultraviolet lightings on Drosophila
 unhone vayask mackhiyon ke sthaan par unke andon par kirann kiya
 These rays can have an impact not only on higher animals and humans but only on very soft animals and reproductive cells
 inaki shakti bahut mand tathaa nune hoti he
 Unless they are attached to special chemicals, their efficiency remains low

 If there is a single breakdown of chromosomes as a result of ionizing radiation, microscopic study of tissues will be necessary
 kintu, jab doharaa bhang hota he or vah bhi ek hi gunasutra main, jab unase hinata or pratilomon utpann hoga
 If the same double breakdown occurs in the non-homologous chromosomes, then transfer will occur
 utparivartanon ke mahatv ke nimnlikhit paksh ho sakate hai- Evolutionary Significance - In the beginning, we have seen that diversity is visible in the creation of the universe

 There is no systematic explanation of the diversity of fauna, however, a summary of what has been heard so far in this regard is as follows- jeevotpatti kii aadim avasthaaon main prithvi kaa vaataavaran anishchit or bhugolic parivesh aaj jaisaa nahin tha
 Physically and chemically, the erstwhile Earth was passing through a special transition period

 Changes in chromosomes resulted in diversity in species, not only in animals
 yah vividhta aaj tak vartmaan he or ab isamen parivartan kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 The reason is that today's natural environment has become sufficiently corrupted and through various technical and scientific inventions, humans are making nature their cherry
 yahi kaaran he ki ab utparivartan ke liye kritrim sadhano kaa prayog karnaa padataa he

 a computer virus or computer virus is a computer program that can duplicate itself and infect a computer without the user's permission, and the user is not even aware of it
 vibhinn prakaar ke mailaware or adware programs ke sandarbh main bhi "virus" shabd kaa upyog saamaanya rup se hota he, haalaanki yah kabhi-kabhi galati se bhi hota he
 The original virus can make changes in duplicates, or the duplicates themselves can make changes, as in a transformed virus
 ek virus ek computer se duusare computer main tabhi fail saktaa he jab iskaa host ek asankramit computer main laayaa jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek upyogkarta ke dwaara ise ek network yaa internet par bhejne se, yaa ise hathaaye jane yogya madhyam jaise flopy discs, CD, yaa USB drive par laane se

kabhi kabhi computer kaa keedaa or trogen horces ke liye bhi bhram purvak virus shabd kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a worm can spread itself to other computers, it does not need to be transferred as a fortune to the host, and a Trojan horse is a file that appears to be harmless
 kide or trogen horse ek commuter system ke aankadon, kaaryaatmak pradarshan, yaa kaary nishpaadan ke dauraan netwarking ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 In general, a worm does not actually harm the system's hardware or software, whereas a Trojan payload, at least in theory, is capable of causing any type of damage during execution
 jab program nahin chal rahaa he tab kuch bhi nahin dikhaai detaa he lekin jaise hi sankramit code chalata he, trogen horse pravesh kar jaataa he
 This is why it is very difficult for people to find viruses and other malware and hence they have to use spyware programs and registration procedures

 On its 50th use, the Elk Cloner virus became active, infecting the computer, and it displayed a short poem "elk Cloner: The program with a personality"
 In The Wild the first PC virus was a boot sector virus that Called Brain Brain), it was created by Farooq Alvi Brothers in 1986, and operated outside Lahore, Pakistan
 inhone is kathith virus ko unke dwaara banaaye gaye software kii pratiyon ki chori rokane ke liye banaaya
yadhyapi, vishleshkon ne daawa kiya ki Ashar virus jo, brain kii ek prajati he, sambhawatah virus ke andar code ke aadhaar par ise purv dinaankit karata he
 Before computer networks became widespread, most viruses spread to removable mediums, especially floppy disks
 shuruaati dinon main nijee computer, ke kai upyogkartaaon ke bich niyamit rup se jaankaree or prograamon kaa vinimay fluopiyon ke dwaara hota tha
 Many viruses spread from infected programs on these disks, while some installed themselves in the boot area of the disk, ensuring that when the user boots the computer from the disk, it will run unintentionally
 KPC first tried to boot from the floppy if any floppy remained in the drive
 jab tak flopi kaa upyog kam nahin ho gaya tab tak yah sarvaadhik safal sankraman ranneeti thi, in the wild boot kshetra ke virason ko bananaa sabase aasaan tha
 Traditional computer viruses emerged in the 1980s, due to increased use of personal computers and as a result increased use of BBS and modems, and software exchanges
 bulatin board software ke aadan pradaan ne pratyaksh rup se trogen horse programs ko failaayaa or virus lokapriy vyavsaayik software ko sankramit karne ke liye banaaye jate the
 Shareware and bootlegs were common carriers for BBS viruses
 hobists ke "piret seen" main jo khudara software, kii avaidh pratiyon kaa vyaek virus ek sankramit mashin par sabhi samparkon ko twarit sandesh ke rup main ek web pataa link bhej saktaa he
 If the recipient thinks that the link is from a friend, they follow the link on the website, the virus present on the site may be able to infect this new computer and start spreading

 The virus is transmitted using cross-site scripting
 2005 ke baad se in the wild, kros sait patakatha virason ke bahut se udahaaran rahe hai, sabase ullekhneey prabhavit saiten hai mispes or yahuu
 To replicate itself, a virus must have permission to execute code and write to memory
 For this reason, many viruses attach themselves to executable files that may be part of the appropriate program
 yadi ek upyog karta ek sankramit program ko shuru karne kii koshish karata he to, aisa ho saktaa he kii pehle virus kaa code nishpadit ho
 viruson ko do prakaar main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, unke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par or unke nishpaadan ke aadhaar par
anivaasee virus tunrat anya poshiyon ko khojate hai jinhen sankramit kiya ja saktaa he, in lakshyon ko sankramit karte hai or antat niyantran ko anuprayog program par sthanantarit kar dete hai jise unhone sankramit kiya he
 Resident viruses do not look for Poshi when they begin
 iske bajaay, ek nivasee virus apane aap ko nishpaadan par smriti main lod kar letaa he or niyantran ko poshi program par sthanantarit kar detaa he
 The virus remains active in the background and infects new hosts when these files are accessed by other programs or by the operating system itself
 aisa mana jaataa he ki anivaasee virus ek khojak modul or ek pratikruti modul se yukt hota he
 The Finder module is responsible for finding new files for transition
 har nai nishpaadan yogya fil ke liye khojak modul akraman kar detaa he, yah fil ko sankramit karne ke liye anulipi modul ko bulaata he
 a resident virus has a duplication module similar to the duplication module employed by a non-resident virus
 yadhyapi yah modul khojak modul ke dwaara nahin bulaayaa jaataa he
 Instead, the virus loads the duplication module into memory when it is executed and ensures that this module executes each time the operating system performs a certain operation
 udhaaharan ke liye, har baar jab oparating system ek sanchika ko nishpadit karata he, anulipi modul ko bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 In this case, the virus infects every appropriate program to be executed on the computer
 kabhi kabhi nivasee virus ko aage do shreniyon main upavibhajit kiya jaataa he ek teevr sankramak or duusare dhimen sankramak
teevr sankramak ko is prakaar se banaaya gaya he ki jitani adhik sanchikaon ko ho sake sankramit kar sake
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek teevr sankramak akses ho sakane vaali har sambhav poshi sanchika ko sankramit karata he
 This is a particular problem for anti-virus softwares, as a virus scanner will access every possible host file when it performs a comprehensive system scan
 yadi virus scanner is baat kaa dhyaan nahin rakh paata ki aisa ek virus smriti main upasthit he, virus scanner par peeche se waar karata he or is prakaar se scan ho rahi sabhi sanchikaon ko sankramit kar detaa he
 Acute infectives rely on rapid infection rates for their spread
 is vidhi kaa nuksaan yah he ki kai sanchikaon ko sankramit karne se pataa lagane kii sambhaavna adhik ho jaati he, kyon ki virus computer ko dhimaa kar detaa he yaa kai sandigdh kriyaaon ko karata he jo virus virdohi software ke dwaara dekhi ja sakati hai
 The second and slower infectives are made in such a way that they infect the host un-covered
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch dhime sankramak sanchikaon ko keval tabhi sankramit karte hai jab unako copy kiya ja rahaa he
 They are not easy to detect due to the limited function of slow infectives: they do not slow down the computer too much, but frequently shock anti-virus softwares that can be detected by the suspicious behavior of the programs
 dhime sankramak bahut adhik safal prathit nahin hote hai, Viruses have targeted different types of transmission media
 yah suchi khatm nahin ho sakati he: pdfs, such as HTML, may be associated with malicious code

 Some older viruses, especially on the MS-DOS platform, ensure that when the file is infected by the virus, the date that the host file is "last modified" remains
 yadhyapi yah drushtikon virus virdohi software ko murkh nahin banataa he, vishesh rup se wo jo sanchika parivartan par chakree atirek kii jaanch ki dinaankon ko banaaye rakhata he
 Some viruses can infect files without increasing their size and damaging the files
 ve aisa nishpaadan yogya sanchikaon ke aprayukt kshetron main adhilekhan ke dwaara karte hai
 This is called cavity virus
 udhaaharan ke liye kii CIH virus, yaa cheranobil virus, portable nishpaadan yogya sanchikaon ko sankramit karata he
 Because there were many free spaces in those files, the virus, which was 1 KB in length, did not get attached to the file size
 Some viruses do not allow themselves to be exposed to the anti-virus software before it is detected
 Because computers and operating systems are becoming more developed and complex, there is a need to upgrade or replace old concealing technologies
 ek computer ko virus se surakshit rakhane ki maang yah ho sakati he ki sanchika tantra har prakaar ke sanchika acces ke liye vistrut or spasht anumati kii or palaayan kar jaae
 a virus needs to be infected to spread further for a virus
 kuch maamalon main, ek poshi ko sankramit karnaa ek kharaab vichaar ho saktaa he udhaaharan ke liye, kai virus virdohi program apane code kii akhandta kii jaanch karte hai
 Therefore infection of such programs will increase the possibility that the virus has been detected
 is kaaran se, kuch virus un prograamon ko sankramit nahin karte hai jo virus virdohi software kaa hissaa he
 Another type of virus that the virus sometimes tries to avoid is bait files
 Bat files are files created specifically by anti-virus software or anti-virus professionals themselves to be infected by a virus
 
 in sanchikaon ko bhinn kaarnon se banaaya ja saktaa he, ye sabhi virus kaa pataa lagane se sambandhit hai
 Since bat files are used to detect viruses or make probes possible, the infection cannot be taken advantage of by the virus
 aam taur par virus aam taur par aisa virus prograamon se batch kar aisa karte hai, jaise choti program sanchikaaye yaa program jinamein ' kooda nirdesh ' ke vishisht praturup hon
batting ko mushkil banane ke liye ek sambandhit ranneeti he viral sankraman
kabhi kabhi, viral sankramak ek poshi sanchika ko sankramit nahin karte hai jo anya sthitiyon main sankraman ke liye upyukt ummidavaar ho saktaa he
 For example, a virus may decide on a random basis whether to infect a file or not, or a virus can infect host files on particular days of the week
 kuch virus oparating system se anurodh karke virus virdohi software ko dhokhaa dene ki koshish karte hai
 The anti-virus software requests to read the file and the request goes to the virus instead of the OS, thus a virus hides itself
 ab virus virdohi software kii sanchika ke asankramit sanskaran par lot jaataa he, jisase ki aisa prathit hota he ki sanchika " svachh " he
 Modern anti-virus software has several techniques for detecting the theft of viruses
 chori ko rokane kii keval ek vishwasaneey vidhi he ek aise madhyam se boot karnaa jo svachh ho
 Most anti-virus programs try to find virus patterns within simple programs, this is called the signature of the so-called virus
 hastakshar ek lakshanik bit praturup he, jo ek vishesh virus yaa virus parivaar kaa ek bhaag he
 If a virus scanner discovers such a pattern in a file, it notifies the user that the file is infected
 upyogkarta phir is sanchika ko nasht kar sakate hai, yaa sankramit sanchika ko " shuddh " yaa " thik "kar sakate hai
 Some viruses use techniques that not only make it difficult to detect by signature, but also impossible
 ye virus prayek sankraman par apana code badal lete hai
 That is, each infected file contains a different species of virus
 virus ke kutalekhan ke liye ek or adhik unnat vidhi he saral ancripshan kaa upyog
is maamle main, virus ek chote se decrypting modul or virus ke code ki ek ancrypted copy se yukt hota he
 If the virus is encrypted with a different key for each infected file, then only part of the virus remains static is the decrypting module, which will be attached to the end of it
 In this case, a virus scanner will use the signature directly of the virus
 Cannot detect, but it can still detect decrypting modules, which can still indirectly detect possible viruses
 chunki ye sankramit poshi par sangrahit kunjia hongi, vastav main antim virus ko vicode karnaa puri tarah se sambhav he, lekin isaki shaayad zarurat nahin he, chunki swayan sanshodhit code itnaa durlabh he ki iske kaaran se virus scanner kam se kam sandigdh sanchika ko ankit kar saktaa he
 An older but compact, encryption involves a static virus that xoring each byte, so that the operation is repeated only for decryption
 This is ambiguous code that modifies itself, so many virus definitions include an encryption / decryption signature
 Could be part
 bahurupi code pehali takanic thi jo virus scanner ke liye ek gambhir khatra bani
 niyamit ancrypted virus kii tarah, ek bahurupi virus apane ancrypted code ke saath sanchikaon ko sankramit karata he, jo ek dicripshan modul ke dwaara dicode kar diya jaataa he
 In the case of polymorphic viruses, this decryption module is also modified on each infection
 isliye thik prakaar se likhe gaye bahurupi virus main aise koi bhaag nahin hai jo sankramanon main samaan hon, yah hastakshar kaa upyog karke iskaa pataa lagaana mushkil banaata he
 Anti-virus software can detect it by decrypting using a competitor, or by statistical replication analysis of the encrypted virus body
 bahurupi code ko sakasham karne ke liye, virus ke paas iske ancrypted sharir main kahin par ek bahurupi ingine hona chahie 
is tarah ke ingine kaise kaam karte he is par takneekee vistaar ke liye bahurupi code dekhen
kuch virus bahurupi code ko is prakaar se kaam main lete hai ki yah mukhya rup se virus ke utparivartan kii dar ko baadhya karata he
 For example, a virus is programmed to mutate only in a short period of time, or it can be programmed to infect a file that already contains duplicate viruses, So it can avoid mutation
 The advantage of using slower polymorphic code is that it makes it difficult for the anti-virus professional to obtain a representative sample of the virus, because BAT files that are infected once they run are typically identical to the virus
 Will be the sample
 This will increase the likelihood that the probe performed by the virus scanner will be unreliable and it may be that some instances of the virus may not be able to detect the probe
 anukaran ke dwaara jaanch se bachane ke liye kuch virus har baar jab ek nae nishpadanyogy ko sankramit karte hai tab apane aap ko punarlikhit kar lete hai
 Viruses that use such technology are called metamorphic ones
 roopantaran ko sambhav banane ke liye ek roopantarit ingine kii jarurat hoti he
 a transformed virus is usually very large and complex
 udhaaharan ke liye, W32 / Simile main samooh bhashaa code kii 14000 se adhik rekhyen hoti hai, jinamein se 90% roopantarit ingine kaa hissaa he
 Just as genetic diversity in a population decreases, it reduces the chance of a single disease, similarly the diversity of software systems on a network also limits the destructive potential of the virus
 yah 1990 main vishesh vichaar kaa vishay ban gaya jab microsoft ne desktop oparating system or karyaalay suite main bazaar main prabhutv praapt kar liya
 Users of Microsoft software and Internet Explorer) are particularly vulnerable to the spread of viruses
 microsoft software ko virus ke dwaara lakshya banaaye jane kaa kaaran he unka desktop prabhutv hona or aksar kai galatiyon or virus lekhakon ke liye chhidron ki vajah se isaki aalochana kii jaati he
 Integrated and non-integrated Microsoft applications and language script applications with access to the file system, and applications with networking features) are also particularly risky
 yadhyapi windos virus ke lekhakon ke liye, sabase lokapriy oparating system he, kuch virus duusare platform par bhi maujuud he
 Any operating system that can allow third-party programs to run can theoretically run viruses
 kuch oparating system dusron ke mukaable kam surakshit hai 
unics aadhaarit OS keval apane upyog kartaaon ko hi apane nirdeshon ke antargat surakshit sthaan ke bheetar nishpaadan kii anumati dete hai
 An Internet-based research showed that there were cases when people deliberately pressed a particular button to download a virus
 a security firm f-secure ran a 6-month campaign on Google adwords that said "is your PC virus free? Get it infected here!"
 The result was 409 clicks
 In 2006 with relatively few security methods that were targeting Mac OS X)
 Older Apple Operating a number of viruses for the system, known as Mac OS Classic, differ greatly in different sources, with Apple being said to have only four types of well-known viruses and 63 according to independent sources There are forms of virus
 yah kahana surakshit he ki bazaar ke kam share ki vajah se Macs ko lakshya banane kii sambhaavna kam hoti he or is prakaar se ek mike vishesh virus keval computaron ke ek chote anupaat ko hi sankramit kar saktaa he
 Virus exposure is the main selling point between 
mex and Windows, one that Apple employs in their Get a Mac ad
 is ke anusaar mex main bhi microsoft vindos ki tarah suraksha ke mudde hote hai, yadhyapi kisi ne bhi in the wild safalataa purvak iskaa purna laabh nahin uthaaya he
 Windows and Unix have the same scripting capabilities, but while Unix naturally prevents normal users from having access to make changes for the operating system environment, older copies of Windows such as Windows 95 and 98 do not
 In 1997, When a virus called "bliss" was released for Linux - major anti-virus vendors issued a warning to fix Unix-like systems
 Are solid, can become susceptible to viruses like
 bliss virus ko virason kaa lakshanik mana ja saktaa he--unics pranaaliyon par --keedon ke vipareet
bliss kii zarurat he ki upyogkarta ise spasht rup se chalaata he or yah keval aise prograamon ko sankramit kar saktaa he jo upyogkarta ke dwaara sanshodhit kiye ja sakate hai
 Unlike Windows users, most Unix users do not log in as an administrator user except by installing software: even if a user runs a virus it cannot harm the operating system
 bliss virus kabhi bhi vyapak nahin hua or mukhya rup se anusandhan ke liye utsukata kaa vishay bana rahaa
iske nirmaataa ne baad main yuzanet ko iskaa strot code post kiya, shodhakartaaon ko yah jaanane ki anumati di ki yah kaise kam karata he
 Since software is often designed with a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized use of the system source, many viruses help spread software bugs in a system or application
 software vikaas ranneetiyaan jo badi sankhya main bag kaa utpaadan karti hai, saamaanya rup se sakasham dohan bhi utpann karti he
 Many users install anti-virus software, which detects or destroys known viruses after a computer download or after the executable has run
 aise do saamaanya tareeke hai jinhen ek virus virdohi software anuprayog virus kii jaanch karne ke liye kaam main letaa he
 The first and most common method of virus detection is to use a list of signature definitions of viruses
 It works by comparing the components of the computer's memory and the boot sector) and files stored on permanent or temporary drives and comparing these files The "signature" of known viruses is against the database
 jaanch kii is vidhi kaa nuksaan yah he ki upyog karta keval virus se surakshit rahata he jo apni pichhali paribhaasha kaa adhyatan karata rahata he
 The second method is the approximate algorithm in which viruses are based on normal behavior
 is vidhi main virason kaa pataa lagane ki kshamta hoti he jiske liye abhi bhi virus virdohi companiyon ko hastakshar bananaa he
 Some anti-virus programs are able to scan open files as well as e-mails sent and received 'on the fly' in a similar way
 ise "on-access scanning"kehete hai
 Anti-virus software does not change the ability of POSHI software to transmit viruses
 upyogkarta ko ptch suraksha chhidr ke liye apane software niyamit rup se adhyatan karne chahie
anti virus software ko bhi niyamit rup se adhyatan kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he taaki aadhunik khataron ko roka ja sake
koi bhi vyakti bhinn media par data ke niyamit rup se byaap se virus ke dwaara kii gai kshati ko kam kar saktaa he, inhen yaa to system se asambaddha, rakhaa jaataa he, yaa anya kaarnon jaise bhinn sanchika pranaaliyon kaa upyog ke liye ise nahin kholaa ja saktaa yaa keval read-only rakhaa jaataa he
 In this way, if data is lost through a virus, anyone can resume using backup
 yadi optical media jaise sidi or dividi par ek byaap satr band ho gaya he, yah read-only ban jaataa he or ab virus se sankramit nahin ho saktaa he
 Likewise, an operating system on a bootable can be used to start a computer if the installed operating system usage is down
 anya vidhi he bhinn sanchika tantron par bhinn aaparating system kaa upyog
ek virus kii donon ko prabhavit karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti he
 Data backup can also be performed on different file systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, linaks ko NTFS vibhaajan par likhane ke liye vishesh software kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, isliye yadi koi software ko install nahin karata he or ek NTFS vibhaajan par ek byaap karne ke liye MS vindos ke alag installation kaa upyog karata he, byaap ko lines ke kisi bhi varjan se surakshit hona chahie
isi tarah, MS vindos sanchika system jaise ext3, ko nahin pard saktaa he, isliye yadi koi saamanyatya MS vindos kaa upyog karata he, ek linaks installation kaa upyog karte hue ek ext3 vibhaajan par byaap banaaya ja saktaa he
 Once a computer is compromised by a virus, it is generally unsafe to continue to use the same computer without fully installing the operating system again
 lekin, kai vikalp hai jo computer main virus ke aane ke baad upasthit hote hai
 These actions depend on the severity of the type of virus
 Windows Me, Windows XP and Windows Vista par ek sambhaavna he ek aujaar jo system ristor ke naam se janaa jaataa he jo ki pichley check bindu ke liye registry or jatil tantra sanchika ko ristor kar ke rakhata he
 Often a virus hangs on to a system and after booting again, the system's restore point will have a problem from the same day
 The work has been done to restore point since the last days, now the virus will store stored files Can not infect
 phir bhi kuch virus, system ke ristor ko or anya mahatvapurn aujaaron jaise task menager or cmand prompt ko niskriy kar dete hai
 An example of a virus that does this is ciadoor
 Administrators have options to disable such tools from limited users for different reasons
 virus aisa karne ke liye registry main sanshodhan karata he, keval us samay aisa nahin hota he jab prashaasak computer ko niyantrit kar rahaa ho, yah sab upyogkartaaon ko aujaaron ko acces karne se roktaa he
 When an infected tool is activated it gives a message "task manager has been disabled by your administrator
 "yahan tak kii yadi upyogkarta jo program kholane kii koshish kar rahaa he vah prashaasak he
 Users who are running the Microsoft operating system can visit Microsoft's website to run a free scan if they have their 20-digit registration number
 oparating system ko punah install karnaa virus hataane kaa ek alag tarika he
 This usually involves re-formatting the OS partition and installing the OS through its original means
 yaa ek saafe bedap chhavi ke saath vibhaajan kii kalpana kii ja sakati he yaa Acronis ke saath liya gaya) 
is vidhi kaa laabh yah he kii yah karne main saral he, kai virus virdohi scan ko chalaane kii tulana main yah tej hota he or kisi bhi mailaware ko dur karne kii guarantee detaa he
 Downsides include reinstalling all other software and operating systems
 upyogkarta data ko ek live sidi ko boot karke yaa hard drive ko kisi duusare computer main rakhkar or us computer ke oparating system se boot karke bek ap kiya ja saktaa he
 Wbfz salauddin: angreji an-nasirsalah ad-din Yusuf ibn Ayyub janm: 1138, nidhan 4 march 1193 barahavin shatabdi kaa ek kurd muslim yoddha tha, jo samakaleen utari iraq kaa rahane vaala tha
 The country at that time was the ruler of Syria and Egypt
 After the death of Sultan Nuruddin Jangi of Syria and Egypt, his two brothers began to rule, but when both brothers died one after the other, now Nuruddin Jungi's most loyal and close to Salauddin Ruler was created
 salauddin ne 1187 main jab jerusalem par vijay praapt kari to pope ke ahvaahan par england kaa badshaah richard da line heart france kaa badshaah or germany kaa badshaah federick kii sena ne hamalaa kiya lekin saluddin ne alag alag yudhdo main federick kii senaao ko parajeet kiya
 The bigger the warrior he was, the greater and efficient the ruler was
 iske saath hi nyaaypriy or raham dil bhi tha
 This is the reason that historians of Europe also praise him in his honor and greatness
 ek baar jab england ke shaasha richard ne musalamaanon se akara kaa kila jeet liya or muslim sena ne kile ko gher liya or yuddh aarambh ho gaya ,usee samay richard biimaar pad gaya or koi acha hakim nahin mil rahaa tha ,tab salauddin ne apana hakim ko dawaaiyon ke saath richard ke paas bheja or uskaa ilaaj karavaaya
 Islamic historians even say that after the Islamic Rashidun Caliphs, there was no such skilled ruler, character and warrior
 barahavin sadi ke ant main uske abhiyaanon ke baad isai-muslim dwandv main ek nirnaayak mode aayaa or jerusalem ke aasapaas kabja karne aae europi isaiyon kaa safaya ho gaya
 Despite defeating the Christians in the Crusade Wars, his image in Europe is that of a skilled warrior and humble soldier
 san 1898 main germany ke raja vilhelm dwitiya ne salauddin kii kabr ko sajaane ke liye paise bhi die the
 He had only a few dirhams at the time of his death, as he used to spend his income for the good of the people
 uski mrityu ke samay kriya-karm bhi uske mitro ne milke karbaya
 Salauddin's fame can be said from the fact that children in Palestine are singing his noise, saying - " naah nu ul musalamin ,kullu nas salauddin" iskaa arth he ki ham musalamaanon ke bete he or hamame sab salauddin he

 vivaah sampann hone ke baad yusuf galilia chhodkar yahudiya praant ke bethalehem naamak nagari main jaakar rahane lage, vahaan isa kaa janm hua
 Joseph fled to Egypt to save the infant from the tyranny of King Herod
 herod 4 i
pus

 main hua tha
 After Herod's death, Joseph returned and settled in the village of Nazareth
 isa jab baarah varsh ke hue, to jerusalem main teen din rukkar mandir main upadeshkon ke bich main baithe, un kii sunate or un se prashn karte hue paaya
 Luke 2:47 And all who heard them were amazed at their understanding and their answers
 tab isa apane mata pita ke saath apana gaanv vaapis laut gaye
 Jesus learned Joseph's profession and continued to work as a carpenter until he was about 30 years old
 bible main unke 13 se 29 varshon ke bich kaa koi zikr nahin miltaa
 At the age of 30, he took a dip in water from John
 dubkee ke baad isa par pavitra aatma aayaa
 After 40 days of fasting, Jesus started teaching people
 tees saal kii umr main isa ne israel kii janata ko yahudee dharm kaa ek nayaa rup prachaarit karnaa shuru kar diya
 At that time, those below thirty years old were not given to read scripture in the hall and to teach
 unhone kaha ki ishwar saakshaat premrup he or us vaqt ke varttman yahudee dharm kii pashubali or karmkand nahin chahta
 Judaism is not the beloved race of God, God loves all countries
 insaan ko krodh main badla nahin lenaa chahie or kshamaa karnaa siikhnaa chahie
 He clearly stated that he is the son of God, he is the Christ and the way to heaven and salvation
 yahudee dharm main qayamat ke din kaa koi khaas zikr yaa mahatva nahin tha, par isa ne qayamat ke din par khaas jor diya - kyonki usee vaqt swarg yaa nark insaani aatma ko milegaa
 Jesus also performed many miracles
 yahudiyon ke kattarpanthi rabbiyon ne isa kaa baari virodh kiya
 He did not find anything special in Jesus like the Messiah
 unhen apane karmkandon se prem tha
 It was a huge sin for him to call himself the son of God
 isaliye unhone us vaqt ke roman governor pilaatus ko isaki shikaayat kar di
 The Romans always feared the Jewish Revolution
 isaliye kattarpanthiyon ko prasann karne ke liye pilaatus ne isa ko cross par maut kii dardanaak sazaa sunai
 According to the Bible, Roman soldiers killed Jesus with a whip
 unhen shahi kapade pahanaae, unke sar par kaanton kaa taj sajaayaa or unpar thuka or aise unhen tauheen main "yahudiyon kaa badshaah" banaaya
 Having carried his own cross on the back, the Romans took him to Galgata, where he was to be hanged on the cross
 galgata pahunchane par, unhen madiraa or pitt kaa mishran pesh kiya gaya tha
 In that era, this mixture was given to reduce the extreme pain of capital punishment
 isa ne ise inkaar kiya
 According to the Bible, Jesus was hung on a cross between two thieves
 isaayiyon kaa maananaa he ki cross par marate samay isa messiah ne sabhi insaanon ke paap swayan par le liye the or isliye jo bhi isa main vishwaas karegaa, use hi swarg milegaa
 Three days after his death, Jesus resurrected and went to heaven 40 days later
 isa ke 12 shishyon ne unke naye dharm ko sabhi jagah failaayaa
 This religion was called Christianity
 herodes raja ke dinon main jab yahudiya ke baitalaham main yishu kaa janm hua, to dekho, purv se kai jyotishi jerushlem main aakar poochne lage
 Where is the king of the Jews who is born? Because we have seen his star in the past and have come to bow down to him
 yah sunakar herodes raja or uske saath sara jerushlem ghabara gaya
 And he gathered all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them, where should Christ be born? They said to him, in Bethlehem, Judea; Because that's how it is written by the prophet
 ki he baitalaham, jo yahuda ke desh main he, tu kisi reeti se yahuda ke adhikariyon main sab se chota nahin; kyonki tujh main se ek adhipati nikalegaa, jo meri praja israel kii rakhwali karegaa
 Then Herod secretly called the astrologers and asked them, at what time did the star appear
 or us ne yah kahkar unhen baitalaham bheja, ki jaakar us balak ke vishay main thik thik maaloom karo or jab vah mil jaae to mujhe samachar do taaki main bhi aakar us ko pranaam karun
 Hearing the king, they went away and, look, the star which they had seen in the past, went ahead of them and reached the place where the child was
 They were very happy to see that star
 or us ghar main pahunchakar us balak ko us kii mata mariyam ke saath dekha or munh ke bal girakar use pranaam kiya; or apana apana yaila kholkar use sona or lohban or gandharas kii bhent chadhaai
 And having received a warning in his dream that he should not go back to Herod, he went to his country by another route
 After they left, see, a messenger of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Get up; Take the child and his mother and flee to the land of Egypt; And stay there until i tell you; Because Herod is looking for this child to have him killed
 vah raat hi ko uthakar balak or us kii mata ko lekar misr ko chal diya
 And remained there until Herod died; Because that word that the Lord had said through the prophet that i had called my son from Egypt to be fulfilled
 jab herodes ne yah dekha, ki jyotishiyon ne mere saath thattha kiya he, tab vah krodh se bhar gaya; or logon ko bhejkar jyotishiyon se thik thik puche hue samay ke anusaar baitalaham or uske aas paas ke sab ladakon ko jo do varsh ke, vaa us se chote the, marava daalaa
 Then the word that was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, that a shrill sound was heard in Ramah, weeping and great lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children and did not want to be calm, because they are not
 Look after Herod's death, the angel of the Lord said to Joseph in Egypt in a dream
 ki uth, balak or us kii mata ko lekar israel ke desh main chalaa ja; kyonking jo balak ke praan lenaa chaahate the, ve mar gaye
 He got up and took the boy and his mother along and came to the land of Israel
 parantu yah sunakar ki arikhalouse apane pita herodes kii jagah yahudiya par rajya kar rahaa he, vahaan jane se daraa; or swapn main chituni paakar galeel desh main chalaa gaya
 And settled in the city of Nazareth; So that the word that was said by the prophets would be called Nazarene
 or balak badhata or balwant hota or buddhi se paripurna hota gaya; or parameshwar kaa anugrah us par tha
 His parents traveled to Jerusalem every year at the Passover
 jab vah baarah varsh kaa hua, to ve parv kii reeti ke anusaar jerushlem ko gaye
 And when they completed those days and returned, the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem; And this was not known by his parents
 ve yah samajhakar, ki vah or yatriyon ke saath hoga, ek din kaa padaav nikal gaye: or use apane kutumbiyon or jaan-pahachaanon main dhundhane lage
 But when they were not found, they returned again to Jerusalem in search of seekers
 or teen din ke baad unhone use mandir main upadeshkon ke bich main baithe, un kii sunate or un se prashn karte hue paaya
 And all those who were listening to him were amazed at his understanding and answers
 tab ve use dekhakar chakit hue or us kii mata ne us se kaha; he putr, tu ne ham se kyon aisa vyavhaar kiya? dekh, tera pita or main kudhate hue tuje dhundhate the
 he told them; Why did you find me Didn't you know that i must be in my father's house? But what he said to them, they did not understand
 tab vah un ke saath gaya or nasarat main aayaa or un ke vash main rahaa; or us kii mata ne ye sab baaten apane man main rakhin
 or yishu buddhi or deal-doll main or parameshwar or manushyon ke anugrah main badhata gaya
 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a virgin in the city of Nazareth in Galilee
 jis kii mangani yusuf naam daaud ke gharaane ke ek purush se hui thi: us kunvaari kaa naam mariyam tha
 And the angel came to him and said, Glory and joy be yours, God is with you, the Lord is with you
 vah us vachan se bahut ghabara gai or sochane lagi, ki yah kis prakaar kaa abhivadan he? swargadoot ne us se kaha, he mariyam; bhaybheet na ho, kyonki parameshwar kaa anugrah tujh par hua he
 And see, you will be pregnant and you will have a son; You name him Jesus
 vah mahaan hoga; or parampradhan kaa putr kehalaayegaa; or prabhu parameshwar uske pita daaud kaa singhaasana us ko degaa
 And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; And his kingdom will not end
 mariyam ne swargadoot se kaha, yah kyonkar hoga? main to purush ko jaanati hi nahin
 The angel answered him; That the Holy Spirit will descend upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, so the Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God
 yishu ne or bhi bahut chinh chelon ke samhane dikhaae, jo is pustak main likhe nahin gaye
 But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and believe that you may have life in his name
 
 This was a very good man with a hand on his head and he was blessed by Jesus who performed countless miracles in his life that were impossible for anyone else on earth

 Then he took them out to Bethany and raised his hands and blessed them
