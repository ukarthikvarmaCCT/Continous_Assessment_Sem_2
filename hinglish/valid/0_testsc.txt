 This movement was postponed in the national interest at the time of war with China in 1962, later in 1979 Uttaranchal Revolutionary Party was formed in Mussoorie, 12 years after the 12-year movement, on 12 August 1991, the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh state of Uttaranchal
 Proposal of was passed and sent for approval of the Central Government
 24 august 1994 ko uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha main ek baar pun: uttrakhand rajya kaa prastaav paas karke kendra sarkaar ko manjuuri ke liye bheja gaya
 The region of Central Himalayas known as Uttaranchal, located in the geographical periphery of snow-capped mountain ranges in the north, the dense forests of Doon and tarai-bhabar in the south, Sadanira Kali in the east and Tons rivers in the west, is considered a cultural region
 is praant kaa naam kurmachal yaa kumaun hone ke vishay main yah kimvadanti kumaun ke logon main prachlit he ki jab vishnu bhagwaan kaa doosraa avatar kurm athwa kachuve kaa hua, to vah avatar kaha jaataa he ki champavati nadi ke purv kurm parvat main jise aajkal kandadev yaa kandev kehete hai, 3 varsh tak khadaa rahaa
 At that time haha huhu deities and Naradadi munishvara praised him
 us kurm -avatar ke charnon kaa chinh pathar main ho gaya or vah ab tak vidyaman hona kaha jaataa he
 Since then the name of this mountain has changed to Kurmachal
 kurmachal kaa praakrit rup bigadate-bigadate 'kumu' ban gaya or yahi shabd bhashaa main 'kumaun' main parivartit ho gaya
 Earlier this name was given to Champawat and surrounding villages
 tatpashchaat kaali nadi ke kinare ke praant-chaalsi, gumdesh, reganu, gangol, khilfati or unheen se mili hooi dhyanirau aadi pattiyaan bhi kaali kumaun naam se prasiddh hui
 As the state expansion of the Chandas increased, the whole state of Kumaon became Kumaon
 sab log main yahi baat prachlit he ki kumaun kaa naam kurmparvat ke kaaran padaa, par thaa
 jodhsingh negiji 'himalay-bhraman' main likhte hai - "kumaun ke log kheti va dhan kamaane main siddhhast hai
 They are big earners, this country is named as Kumaon "
 kaali kumaun kaa naam kaali nadi ke kaaran nahin, balki kaalu tadaagi ke naam se padaa, jo kisi samay champavat main rajya karata tha
 These facts have to be accepted that it is not a universal rule for the name of a territory to be known as a king
 kisi pradesh yaa bhubhag kaa naam kisi kaaran se adhik prasiddh hote hai
 Its adjective 'kali' has also been derived from dense, black bushes of cedar and sterile
 chand raajaaon ke samay aisa bhi hamen maaloom hua he ki kurmaachal main teen shashan mandal the - 1

 Kumaon is referred to as 'kyunan' by the British, 'kamaun', indigenous people called 'kamayun', 'kumaon' and Sanskritist 'kurmachal'
 khaas kaali kumaun main champavat kaa naam 'kumu' kaha jaataa he
 There people still call Champawat as 'kumu'
 uttrakhand sangharsh se rajya ke gathan tak jin mahatvapurn tithiyon or ghatnaon ne mukhya bhoomika nibhaai ve is prakaar hai :- Many violent incidents also happened in Uttarakhand state movement which are as follows: - 1 sitambar, 1994 ko uttrakhand rajya aandolan kaa kaala diwas mana jaataa he, kyonki is din jaisi police kii barbartapurna kaarywahi isse pehle kahin or dekhne ko nahin mili thi
 Indiscriminate firing was carried out on the agitators without warning by the police, resulting in the death of seven agitators

 Martyrs killed in Dehradun firing: swa0 rajesh ravat kii mrityu tatkaaleen samaajawaadee party netaa sooryakanth dhasmana ke ghar se hui fyring main hui thi
 On 3 October 1994, the entire Uttarakhand was boiled against the Rampur Tiraha incident and the police-administration was ready to suppress it in any way
 isi kadi main kotdwar main bhi aandolan hua, jisamen do aandolankariyon ko pulicekarmiyon dwaara ricel ke baton va dandon se peet-petakar maar daalaa gaya Martyrs killed in Kotdwar case: nainital main bhi virodh charam par tha, lekin iskaa netritv buddhijiviyon ke haath main hone ke kaaran police kuch kar nahin pai, lekin isaki bhadaas unhone nikaali hotel prashanth main kaam karne vaale pratap singh ke upar

 vigyaan, prakruti kaa vishesh gyaan he
 Although man has been acquiring knowledge of nature since ancient times, yet science is a product of ancient times
 isi yug main iskaa aarambh hua or thode samay ke bheetar hi isane badi unnati kar lee he
 Thus a huge revolution took place in the world and a new civilization, based on science, was created
 brahmand ke pareekshan kaa samyak tarika bhi dhire-dhire viksit hua
 It is better to do some experiments on it and to inspect it carefully rather than speaking or arguing about anything
 is vidhi ke parinaam is arth main saarvatrik hai ki koi bhi un prayogon ko punah doharaa kar praapt aankadon kii jaanch kar saktaa he
 So far, scientific method is the best among invented methods to separate truth from untruth and confusion
 sankshep main vaigyanik vidhi nimna prakaar se kaary karti he: The biggest feature of a scientific theory or hypothesis is that there should be scope to prove it to be untrue
 jabaki majahabi manyataayen aisi hotin hai jinhe asaty siddh karne kii koi gunjaaish nahin hoti
 For example, 'those who follow the path shown by Jesus, only those will go to heaven' - its truth cannot be examined
 prashn yah he ki vigyaan kii drut gati se jo unnati hui, uskaa shrey kise he? kya pracheen kaal ke manushya in arvachin vaigyanikon kii apeksha buddhi kam rakhte the? yadi aisi baat he, to darshan, sahitya evam lalit kalaon kii unnati pracheen samay main itani adhik kyon hui? sambhavat: iskaa rahasy un vaigyanik vidhiyon main nihit he, jinka prashray paakar vigyaan itani unnati kar sakaa he
 Early science began about three hundred years ago
 jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, pracheen kaal main bhi vigyaan kii kuch unnati hui, kintu uskaa kram aage na bad paaya
 Therefore some thing must have been behind it
 vastut: pracheen kaal ke manishiyon ne jo bhi gyaan arjeet kiya, use buddhivaadee kahana thik hoga
 On the strength of his intelligence and reasoning, he spoke of the highest level of knowledge, but there was no system of his type and enhancement and he could not be widely publicized and broadcasted throughout the world
 Ancient science is the practical knowledge to the contrary, which was initially opposed Happened
 isi ke falswaroop galileo jaise agragami vaigyanikon ko kadi yatnaayen sahani padin
 Nevertheless, the seed of transmission was also hidden within the verification method by experiment
 is prakaar jo gyaan miltaa gaya, vah ek shrunkhlaa main aabaddh ho chalaa, jiskaa kram aage bhi jari rahaa
 This knowledge revealed new sources of power and as a result, not only its opposition reduced but a huge revolution took place in the society
 mashin yug kaa sutarapaat hua or sansar me aashaa kii ek nai kiran saamne ai
 But just as all aspects of good and evil are associated with all things, science is not only a boon for humans, its vampiric form is seen by the world as an atom bomb in Hiroshima, due to which the destruction of the world and The scene of the Holocaust of Leela is present
 is prakaar sansar ke saamne "satya ko keval satya ke liye" khoj na karne kii aavashyaktaa jaan padi or "satyam shivan sundaram" ke adarsh ko vigyaan jagat main bhi apnaanaa hi shreyaskar maaloom hua
 Science can contribute to human welfare only by being controlled in this way
 isi niyantran ke falswaroop parmanviya bhatthiyaan baniin, jo ek prakaar se niyantrit atum bam maatr hai, kintu jinase apaar suvidhaayen mil sakati hai
 In this way, we see that in a short period of time science has made great progress and all its credit is due to experimentation, which was not used in ancient times
 is prayogvidhi main prayog kaa mahatv sarvopari he, phir bhi anya or vidhiyon kaa upyog bhi ek vishesh dhang or kram se kiya jaataa he, jinhen ham vaigyanik vidhiyaan kah sakate hai
 The methods which are used collectively or partially in the study of science are described below: nirikshan - jis prakritik vastu yaa ghatana kaa adhyayan karnaa ho, sabase pehle uskaa dhyanpurvak nirikshan aavashyak he
 If an event is transient, it is necessary to depict it so that it can be inspected later, such as an eclipse
 nirikshan ke liye sookshmdarshi yaa doordarshee kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, taaki adhik vistaar ke saath or thik thik nirikshan ho sake
 If other people are also doing the work of inspection, then it should be welcomed that the focus is only on the inspected object, just as Arjuna was only seeing the head of the bird at the time of the examination of commerce
 kabhi-kabhi kis vastu ke vishay main mastishk main pehle se kuch dharna bani rahati he, jo nishpaksh nirikshan main bahut baadhak hoti he
 At the time of inspection, one should act free from such assumptions
 varnan - nirikshan ke saath hi saath, yaa turant baad, nirikshit vastu yaa ghatana kaa varnan likhnaa chahie
 For this, the use of measured words should be done, so that a picture of the object that is not in front of the reader is drawn
 jahaan kahin aavashyaktaa ho, anumaan ke dwaara ankon main vastu ke gunavishesh kii maap de deni chahie, kitu yah tabhi karnaa chahie jab vaisaa karnaa baad main upyogi siddh honevaala ho
 While describing the color of flowers, it is useless to give approximate wavelength, but it is better to compare the hardness of an object in numbers than in any other object
 vyarth ke vyore na die jaaen or bhashaa saral tathaa subodh ho
 a description of the country, time and environment should be given so that the circumstances under which the object may be available can be known
 kaary-kaaran-vivechan - prakruti ke rahasyodghatan main kaaryakaaran kaa vivechan mahatvapurn he
 Rainfall, thunderstorms, lightning flashes, windstorms and storms etc
 can occur together
 inamen koun kitna kaaran hai? praaia: kaaran pehle aata he, kintu keval kram hi kaaran kaa nishchay nahi karata
 Therefore, these things should be considered a little, so that there is no further confusion
 saath hi vibhinn kaarnon kaa taratamya bhi band rakhana chahie
 All these things are helpful in understanding the incident
 prayogikaran - vigyaan kii is yug main jo bhi sheeghra unnati ho pai, uskaa ekmaatr shrey is vidhi ko hi he, kyoki anya vidhiyaan to isi mukhya vidhi ke ird gird sanjoyi gai hai
 This technique is a product of this era
 pracheen samay main isi ke abhaav main vigyaan kii pragati nahin ho pai thi
 The development of space travel and cosmic power has become possible due to this experimentation
 prayog or saadhaaran nirikshan main kya antar he? prayog main bhi to nirikshan kaa kaary hota he
 In fact, in ordinary inspection, there is no interference with nature, but in the experiment
 falswaroop aisi sambhaavnaayen evam paristhitiyaan nikal aati hai jinase prayog ke samay kaa nirikshan rahasyodghatan main bada sahaayak hota he
 Experiments are done to find out the truth, but as a result of continuous scientific experiments, a situation has arisen that it is not good to use only in the name of truth, if it is not true
 us satya se kya laabh jiske falswaroop saare sansar kaa vinaash nischitpraaya ho
 So it is good that atomic tests are being opposed all over the world at this time
 satya kii khoj ke vaaste hi yah pareekshan kuch rashtron ke dwaara hote rahete hai, kintu uske parinamswaroop radio activata badhati ja rahi he or ho saktaa he, bhavishya main uske kaaran janajivan ke liye baari khatra paidaa ho jaae
 Truth and honesty have to be exercised while experimenting
 shuddhi or trutiyon kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he
 After studying many variations, a result is drawn
 yadi koi asangat baat dikhalaai pade, to use chhod nahin diya jaataa, balki dhyanpurvak usapar vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes big inventions have occurred in this sequence
 nirikshan ko kai baar duharaaya jaataa he or madhyamaan parinaam par hi bal diya jaataa he
 Method, inspection and results are described in technical language
 pariklpana - prayog karne kaa ek maatr uddeshy prakruti ke kisi rahasy kaa udghaatan hota he
 One has to understand why and how an event occurs
 varsha kyon hoti he? indradhanush kaise banataa he? is prakaar ke prashnon ke uttar dene ke liye ek pariklpana kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 If the hypothesis is correct, it will fit the test
 pariklpana kii jaanch ke liye vibhinn prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Later, such facts also come to light that can confirm that hypothesis
 yadi aisi baaten hai, to usee pariklpana ko siddhant yaa niyam kii sagya di jaati he, anyathaa uskaa sanshodhan karnaa padataa he, yaa use chhod dena padataa he
 Newton's law of motion and Einstein's theory of relativism are examples of this
 aagaman - jab kisi varg ke kuch sadasyon ke gun gyaat hon, to unke aadhaar par us vargvishesh ke gunon ke bare main anumaan lagaana upapaadan kehalaata he
 For example, A, B, c etc
 manushya maranshil praani hai; iske aadhaar par kaha jaataa he ki sab manushya maranshil praani he
 For this type of generalization it is necessary that the samples that are collected are done in an uneventful manner, otherwise the result that will be drawn will not be correct
 kabhi kabhi kuch raashiyon kaa madhyamaan nikaala jaataa he, kintu yah tabhi karnaa thik hoga jab aisa karnaa tarksangat ho
 For example, "lekha jokha thahe, boy drowned kahe" shows that the average river depth may submerge a boy even though it is less than the height of a boy
 nigaman - aagaman main jo kaary hota he, uskaa ulta nigaman main hota he
 It speculates about the properties of a member of that class based on the characteristics of a particular class, such as a human is a living being, so "a", which is a human being, is mortal
 nishkarsh nikaalane kii is vidhi ko hi nigaman kehete hai
 Two things are required for this: incorporation must be feasible and rational
 ganit or praturup - bahut si baaten hamaari samaj se pare hai, unke samajhane main praturup se badi sahaayta milti hai
 The internal structure of the body, the organization of molecules, etc
, become well-understood with the help of subject models
 ganit ke dwaara bhi vigyaan ke kathin prashnon ko hal karne main badi sahaayta milti he
 There are many things that cannot be assimilated by our senses, such as matter-of-factness, but their investigation has been made possible by the sources of mathematics and confirmed by experiments
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki aadhunik vigyaan kii pragati main ganit kaa bahut bada haath he
 Scientific approach - in the end remains a very important method
 vah he kisi prashn ke prati vaigyanik drushtikon kaa apnaanaa
 Keeping the spirit of search with an open mind is the right approach to think and keep your personality separate from the question and reach a conclusion with truth and unbiased sense
 jivan ke roj ke prashnon main bhi is prakaar kaa drushtikon apnaanaa shreyaskar he
 Many people believe that the Indian philosopher-scientist Gautama or Akshapada was presented as a Nyasutra by the scientific method being adopted all over the world

 Martial arts or fighting arts are systems of methodical practice and traditions of training for defense
 sabhi marshall arts kaa ek samaan uddeshy he : khud kii yaa dusron kii kisi shaareerik khatare se raksha 
 Martial arts are considered both science and art
 inamen se kai kalaon kaa pratispardhaatmak abhyaas bhi kiya jaataa he, zyaadaatar ladaai ke khel main, lekin ye nrity kaa rup bhi le sakati hai
 Martial arts refers to the art of war and is a fifteenth-century European term associated with the art of fighting, which is known today as historical European martial arts
 marshall art ke ek kalakaar ko marshall kalakaar ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he

 The invention of integrated circuits led to the creation of a microprocessor
 microprocesar ke astitv main aane ke purv sipiu alag-alag electronic avyavon ko jodakar banaae jate the yaa phir laghustareey ekikaran vaale paripathon se
 The first microprocessor was built in 1970
 tab iskaa prayog electronic pariklakon main binary coded decimal kii gananaa karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Later, 4 and 8 bit microprocessors were used in terminals, printers and automation devices
 vishwa main mukhyat: do badi microprocesar utpaadak companiyaan he - intel or e

 Among these, the processors of Intel company are used more
 prayek company procesar kii takanic or uski kshamta ke anusaar unhe alag alag code naam detii hai, jaise intel company ke pramukh procesar hai pantium -1, pantium -2, pantium -3, pantium -4, salleron, kor tu duyo aadi
usee tarah e
em
di
 company ke pramukh procesar hai ke-5, ke-6, athelon aadi
 The invention of the microprocessor is usually attributed to a microprocessor called Intel-4004
 intel ne ise 1971 main bazaar main nikaala tha

 is microprocesar kii visheshtaon ko stanley major or bijicom ke ejeeniyar matsatoshi sima ne joda
 Credit for developing the modern chip is given to Frederico Feagin
 frederico ne hi silicon get takanic kaa avishkaar kiya jiske dwaara microprocesar kaa sipiu main upyog ho sakaa
 The microprocessor capability is measured in hertz
 procesar 8, 12, 16, 32 or aadhuniktam 64 bit ke bhi lonchhue hai
 The processor reads the messages in the computer's memory in a sequential manner and then works accordingly

 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he

 Despite the high elevation of the Hindu Kush Mountains, there are many passes in this range from which the movement of people from this chain has been there for centuries
 hindu kush parvaton ko sanskrit main 'paariatr parvat' bulaayaa jaataa tha
 When Alexander the Great was conquered in this region, these mountains were called 'kaukasosh Indikaush' i
e
 'indian Mountains' in Greek language
 baad main inkaa naam 'hindu kush', 'hindu kuh' or 'kuh-e-hindu' padaa
 'kuh' or 'koh' means 'mountain' in Persian, but there is a dispute about the meaning of 'kush'
 san 1333 isvi main ebn batuta ke anusaar iskaa matlab 'maarane vaala' tha
 This implies that after the occupation of the Arabs and Turks on the northern Indian subcontinent, Hindus were taken from these mountains as slaves and many of them died in the snow here
 iske vipareet kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar 'kush' keval 'kuh' kaa ek or rup he, yaa phir 'hindu kash' yaa 'hindu kesh' kaa bigadaa rup he, jiskaa matlab 'bharat kii seemaa' nikalataa he
 It may also be that the Greek name of 'kaukasosh Indikaush' was a spoiled form after two thousand years

 The adopted son was named Damodar Rao
 britani raaj ne apni rajya hadap niti ke tahat balak damodar raav ke kilaaf adaalat main muqadama daayar kar diya
 Although there was a lot of debate in the case, it was dismissed
 britani adhikariyon ne rajya kaa khazaana zabt kar liya or unke pati ke karz ko rani ke salanaa karch main se kaatane kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 As a result, the queen had to leave the fort of Jhansi and go to the Ranimahal of Jhansi
 par rani lakshmibai ne himmat nahin haari or unhonen har haal main jhansi rajya kii raksha karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Jhansi became a major center of the 1857 war where violence erupted

 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili
 He announced that now that India has a golden opportunity, it should intensify its campaign for liberation
 8 sitambar 1939 ko yuddh ke prati party kaa rukh tay karne ke liye subhash ko vishesh aamantrit ke rup main congress kaary samiti main bulaayaa gaya
 He also reiterated with his opinion that if the Congress cannot do this work, the forward block will start a war against the British Raj on its own
 agle hi varsh july main kalakatta sthit halwat stambh jo bharat kii gulaami kaa pratik tha subhash kii youth brigade ne ratorat vah stambh mitti main mila diya
 Subhash's volunteers uprooted each brick of his foundation
 yah ek pratikatmak shuruyaat thi
 Through this, Subhash had given the message that as he has mixed this column in the dust, in the same way, he will also play brick by brick of the British Empire
 iske parinamswaroop angrej sarkaar ne subhash sahit forward block ke sabhi mukhya netaaon ko kaid kar liya
 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police
 sharadbabu ke bade bete shishir ne unhe apni gaadi se kolkata se dur gomoh tak pahunchaaya
 They reached Peshawar after catching a frontier mail from Gomoh railway station
 peshawar main unhen forward block ke ek sahakaari, miyaan akbar shah mili
 Mian Akbar Shah met him with Bhagatram Talwar of Kirti Kisan Party
 bhagatraam talwaar ke saath subhash peshawar se afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ore nikal pade
 In this journey, Pathan and Subhash named Bhagatram Talwar Rahmat Khan became his deaf and dumb deaf
 pahadiyon main paidal chalate hue unhone yah safar puraa kiya
 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him
 aakhir main arlando mazonta naamak italian vyakti banakar subhash kabul se nikalakar rus kii rajdhani masco hote hue germany kii rajdhani berlin pahunche
 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay kinhin bhi do deshon kii nausenaon kii pandubbiyon ke dwaara nagarikon kii yah ekmaatr adla-badali hui thi
 This Japanese submarine brought them to Padang Port in Indonesia
 purvi asia pahunchakar subhash ne sarvapratham vayovruddh krantikari rasbihari bose se bhartiya swatantrata parishad kaa netritv sanbhaala
 Rasbihari voluntarily handed over the leadership of the Freedom Council to Subhash in Singapore's Edward Park
 japan ke pradhanmantri general hideki tojo ne netaji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar unhen sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan
 21 oktober 1943 ke din netaji ne singapore main arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind kii sthapana kii
 He himself became the President, Prime Minister and War Minister of this government
 is sarkaar ko kul nau deshon ne manyata di
 Netaji also became the chief commander of the Azad Hind Fauj
 azaad hind fouj main japani sena ne angrejon kii fouj se pakade hue bhartiya yudhbandiyon ko bhartee kiya tha
 The Rani Regiment of Jhansi was also formed for women in Azad Hind Fauj
 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 Japanese general Shodei, Pilate, and some others aboard the plane were killed
 netaji gambheer rup se jal gayi the
 He was rushed to Taihoku military hospital where he succumbed
 karnal habiburrahman ke anusaar unka antim sanskaar taihoku main hi kar diya gaya
 In mid-september, their bones were collected and placed in the Rankoji temple of Tokyo, the capital of Japan
 bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar se praapt dastauez ke anusaar netaji kii mrityu 18 agast 1945 ko taihoku ke sainik aspataal main raatri 21
00 baje hui thi
 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country
 faijabad ke gumnami baba se lekar chhattisgarh rajya main jila raigarh tak main netaji ke hone ko lekar kai daawey pesh kiye gayi lekin in sabhi kii pramanikta sandigdh he
 In Chhattisgarh, the case of Subhash Chandra Bose went to the state government
 parantu rajya sarkaar ne ise hastkshep ke yogya na maanate hue maamle kii file hi band kar di
 The Calcutta High Court has ordered the formation of a special bench to hear the demand to make the intelligence documents related to the mystery of Netaji's disappearance public
 yah yachika sarkari sanghathan indiaj smil dwaara daayar kii gayi he
 Many others including the Union of India, National Advisory Council, RAW, Intelligence Department, Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Defense Secretary, Home Department and the Government of West Bengal have been made defendants in this petition
 hiroshima or nagasaki ke vidhwans ke baad saare sandarbh hi badal gayi
 After surrender, Japan kept groaning under America's feet for four-five years
 yahi kaaran tha ki netaji or aaazaad hind sena kaa romaharshak itihaas tokio ke abhilekhaagaar main varshon tak padaa dhul khaataa rahaa
 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity
 angrejon ke dwaara kiye gayi vidhivat dushprachaar tathaa tatkaaleen pramukh raajnneetik dalon dwaara subhash ke virodh ke baavjood saare desh ko jhakzor denevaale us mukademe ke baad matayen apane beton ko ‘subhash’ kaa naam dene main garv kaa anubhav karne lageen
 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this
 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country
 jahaan swatantrata se purv videshi shaasha netaji kii samarthy se ghabaraate rahe, to swatantrata ke uparant deshi sattadhish janamanas par unke vyaktitv or kartrutv ke amit prabhaav se ghabaraate rahe
 Swatantraveer Savarkar organized a conference of revolutionaries after independence and placed Netaji's oil painting on the seat of the Speaker
 yah ek krantivir dwaara duusare kranti vir ko di gayi abhootpurv salaami thi
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha
 This book became very famous

 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke sankalan evam prakaashan kaary se aarambh se hi sugat bose bhi jude hue the or antim do khandon kaa prakaashan dow0 shishir kumaar bose ke dukhad nidhan ke kaaran mukhyatah sugat bose ke hi sampadan main hua
 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that in the context of Netaji like Mahatma Gandhi, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed
