 Some non-pathan people also follow the Pakhtunvali under the influence of the Pathans
 yah ek aachaar samhita he jo vyaktigat jivan ke saath saath saamaajik jivan kaa bhi maargdarshan karti he
 Pashtunwali is the code of conduct followed by the majority of Pathans
 yah kehane main koi harz nahin he ki pathan jab tak pakhtunavali kaa paalan karte rahe tab tak unhone duniya par raaj kiya va kabhi bhi kisi se parajeet nahin hue
 When they stopped following Pakhtunvali in India, they were defeated by the Jat Marathas, Mughal Britishers, all of them, and the Mufalis surrounded them
 pehle bataaya ja chukaa he ki pakhtun bani israel se hai
 This is God's chosen demos
 pakhtunavali ke siddhanth musa alaihissalam kii tauraat par hi aadhaarit hai
 This includes the Ahad that God had tied to the Israel of Bani
 jab bani israel apana vaada puraa karenge to khuda bhi apana vaada puraa karegaa jo usne bani israel se kiya tha
 As it has also come in the Quran Sharif, o Israel, you fulfill your promise that you have made to me, so that i can fulfill my promise that i made to you
 pakhtunon ne apana paanch hazaar saal ke itihaas kaa bhi record surakshit rakhaa hua he
 Pakhtunwali is a code of conduct that promotes self-respect, freedom, justice, hospitality, love, forgiveness, revenge, tolerance etc
 yah sab kuch sabake liye he, jisamen ajanabi va paradesi bhi shaamil hai chaahe unki jati, dharm, vishwaas, rashtriyata kuch bhi ho
 It is the personal responsibility of every Pathan to follow or protect Pashtunwali
 mukhya siddhantapaktunavali ke kuch mukhya siddhanth is prakaar hai
 1
 Melmastia Melmastia - Kindness, kindness and hospitality to be shown to all strangers and strangers
 isamen dharm, jati, mulvansh rashtriyata aadi ke aadhaar par koi bhedbhaav naa karnaa
 All this should be done without any hope or reward in return
 pashunon kii mehmaan nawazi duniya bhar main mashhoor he
 2
 Nanawatai: - Nanawatai - If anyone asks for help and protection to protect them from their enemies, then they should be given protection
 har qeemat par unhen sangrakshan diya jaataa he
 Those who are running away from the law should be given talc protection at that time till the situation is cleared
 jab parajeet paksh vijeta ke paas jaataa he, tab bhi unhen sangrakshan diya jaataa he
 In many cases, surrendering takes refuge in his enemy's house
 3
 badal – koon ke badale koon, aankh ke badale aankh, daant ke badale daant
 It seems that this is contrary to the principle of pardoning, mercy
 lekin aisa samaj kam hone ke kaaran galat fahemiyaan paidaa hoti hai
 It is important to apologize, that the mistake is asking for forgiveness
 bagaiyr maange kisi maafi? yah sabhi prakaar ke gunahon va aparaadhon par lagu he
 Whether the wrongdoing was done yesterday, it was done a thousand years ago
 agar galati karne vaala zindaa naa ho to uske nazadiiki koon ke rishte vaale se badla liya jayega
 4
 Tureh Tureh - a Pathan must bravely fight for the protection of his land, property, family women etc
 yah pashtun stri purush donon hi kii zimmedaari he
 For this, if he needs to embrace death, then he should embrace death
 5
 sabaat Sabat –har ek ne apane parivaar, doston, qabeele, aadi ke prati vafaadaar hona chaiye
 Sabhat or faithfulness is very important and a Pathan can never be unfaithful
 6
 eemaandaaree Imandari – ek pakhtun ne hameshaa acchhee baaten sochna chaiye, acchhee baaten bolnaa chaiye, achche kaam karnaa chaiye
 Pakhtoon must honor all Cheezes, including people, animals and environment
 inako nasht karnaa pakhtunavali ke kilaaf he
 7
 Istekamat Isteqamat - Believing in God
 pashto main jise khuda, arabi main allaah va hindi main vagvaan kaha jaataa he
 This is called Ghad in English
 aisa vishwaas karnaa ki khuda ek he, usee ne sari duniya kii sabhi chizein banaai hai
 This is a thousand years old Pakhtunwali doctrine equivalent to Islam's Tauheed
 8
 gairat:- Ghayrat – pakhtun ne hameshaa apana maanviya garima banaaye va bachaaye rakhana chaiye
 Dignity is very important in Pakhtun society
 unhone apni va anya logon kii bhi garima ko banaaye va bachaaye rakhana chaiye
 They should respect themselves and respect others too
 Namus Namus - a Pathan should protect the honor of Pathan women and girls at all costs
 anya mahatvapurn siddhanth:-  azaadi:- shaareerik, maansik, dharmik ruhani, raajnneetik va aarthik azaadi, us samay tak jab tak ki yah dusron ko nuksaan naa pahunchane lage
  Justice and forgiveness: - If someone willfully do wrong and if you did not ask for justice nor did the wrongdoer apologize, do not take revenge according to Dant in lieu of blood instead of eye for blood Go, this is a loan on Pathan
 yahaan tak ki yah us par ek bandhan he ki use aisa karnaa hi hoga
 Whether it is a Pathan woman or a Pathan male
  vaade puure karnaa:- ek asli pathan kabhi bhi apane vaade se mukaregaa nahin
  Unity and equality: - No matter what language they speak, whether they belong to any tribe, whether poor or rich, no matter how much money they have, Pakhtunwali ties a thread to the Pakhtuns or Pathans of the whole world
 har insaan baraabar he, yah pashtunavali kaa mul siddhanth tha
  Right to be heard: - No matter what language they speak, whether from any tribe, whether poor or rich, no matter how much money they have, everyone has the right to speak in the society and in the jirga Be heard  parivaar va vishwaas:- yah maananaa ki har ek pakhtun stri va purush anya pakhtunon kaa bhai va bahan he, chaahe pakhtun 1 hazaar qabeelon main hi bante kyon naa hon
 a Pakhtoon is a family, they should take care of the women, daughters, elders, parents, sons, and husbands of other Pakhtun families
  sahyog:- garib va kamazoron kii madad kii jaani chaiye vah bhi is prakaar se ki kisi ko maaloom bhi naa pade
  Acquiring Ilm or Knowledge: - Pakhtun should keep trying to keep increasing his knowledge about life, history, science, civilization, culture etc
 pakhtun ne apana dimaag hameshaa naye vichaaron ke liye khulaa rakhana chaiye
  Fight against evil: - There is a constant battle between good and evil, Pakhtun must fight against evil wherever he sees evil
 yah uskaa farz he
 Hewad: - hewad-pakhtun must love his Pakhtun country
 ise sudhaarney va muqammal banane kii koshish karte rahanaa chaiye
 Pakhtun civilization and culture should be protected
 kisi bhi prakaar ke videshi hamale kii sthiti main pakhtun ne apane desh pakhtuunakva kii hifaazat karnaa chaiye
 Protecting the country means defending civilization culture, traditions, values of life, etc
  dod pasbani:- pakhtun par yah bandhankaree he ki vah pakhtun sabhyataa va saskruti kii hifaazat kare
 Pashtunwali advises that Pakhtun should never give up Pashto language in order to do it successfully
 pashto pakhtun sabhyataa va samskruti ko bachaane kaa mukhya strot he

 Truth has different meanings in different contexts and different theories
 nyaay darshan main pramukh rup main prayek nirnay or anumaan par vichaar hota he
 The central place of decision in these
 nirnay kaa shabdic prakaashan vaakya he
 When we listen to a sentence, we accept or reject it; The state of inability to decide between accept and reject is called doubt
 prayek nirnay satya hone kaa daawa karata he
 When we accept it, we accept its claim as true; In rejection, it is called untrue
 vishwaas hamaari saadhaaran maansik avasthaa he
 When an error appears in a belief, then the mental act of moving its place to another belief is contemplation
 vishwaas, satya ho yaa asaty, kriya kaa aadhaar he, yahi jivan main ise mahatvapurn banaata he
 The job of justice is to check the truth of the judgment or sentence; For this, it is inconsistent whether one considers it to be true or not
 satya ke sambandh main do prashn vichaar ke yogya hai - kisi nirnay yaa vaakya ko satya kehane main hamaara abhipraay kya hota he
 What is the measuring instrument to distinguish truth and untruth? Prominent among our disciplines of knowledge are our own states of consciousness, natural substances, and other centers of consciousness, or the minds of others
 main kahata hoon ki mujhe daant main dard ho rahaa he
 what is the meaning of this? My experience is a stream in which there is a constant movement
 main kahata hoon ki dhara kaa jo bhaag vartmaan main gyaat he, du:kha kii anubhuti usamen pramukh paksh he
 It is a clear experience for me and i cannot doubt it
 mere liye ise jaanchne ko doosraa maapak na he, na ho saktaa he
 No other experience has more authority than clear perception

 Some people say that on the basis of conformity we believe in their existence

 What is the meaning of the reality of this sentence? main khyaal karata hoon ki mujhase alag, baahar, mej or pustak vidyaman hai or unamem ek vishesh sambandh he
 If this is indeed the case then my sentence is true; Failure to do so is untrue
 yah "satya kaa anurupata siddhant" he
 The principle of conformity is formed from objectivism and is universally accepted
 bharat ke darshan main pratyaksh ko pratham pramaan kaa pad diya gaya he
 The direct "is the fruit of the sense and proximity of the subject"
 yah samipya do prakaar se ho saktaa he : yaa to padaarth indriya ke paas aae, yaa man indriya dwaar se guzarakar padaarth tak pahunche
 The second event occurs and the mind takes the form of the subject

 apane vichaaron kaa to hamen spasht bodh hota he, par baahar kii sthiti ko ham kaise jaanate hai? ham do vichaaron ko saath rakhkar unki samanta asamanta kii babat kah sakate hai, parantu bahya padaarth to hamaari chetana main pravisht hi nahin ho saktaa

 It is an experience
 parantu aankh kabhi kabhi dhokhaa bhi de detii he
 i touch the book and the table by hand
 yah doosraa anubhav pehle anubhav kii pushti karata he
 If i knock with my hand, the word which is heard seems to come out of the book and the table
 teesraa anubhav pehle donon anubhavon kii pushti karata he duusare bhi pustak ko mej par padaa dekhte hai
 Conformity is a sign of truth, but this conformity is between different parts of experience, not between thought and external matter
 aakarshananium ke anusaar prayek padaarth anya padaarthon se aakrisht hota he or unhen khinchataa bhi he
 Similarly, all parts of true knowledge are dependent on each other
 jo nirnay is tarah shesh anubhav se yukt ho saktaa he, vah satya he; jisamen yah yogyata nahin vah asaty he
 From this description it seems that truth is a community of many truth sentences and each truth has its own independent position in this community
 avirodhwaad is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin karata
 Truth is not a community but a whole whose element determines the form of partial truths
 vastav main satya ek hi he, bahuvachan main satyon kaa varnan karnaa anuchit he
 If some monologue in the group is separated, then there is no difference in the position of others

 "india became independent in 1947 AD
 " 1947 i
 se pehle yah vaakya kaha hi nahin ja saktaa tha, parantu ab yah bhi sadaa ke liye satya he
 The third principle of truth is known as "behaviorism" or "pragmatism"
 apane aadhunik rup main yah america kii dein he
 Practicalism, in fact, is not a theory, an attitude which gives more importance to the special than the general, change to stability, action to contemplation
 is vichaar ke prasar main chalrs peers, wiliam james or jaan diu kaa vishesh bhaag he
 Pierce was neorealistic, James was a psychologist, Dieu was interested in policy and politics
 peers ne pratyayon ke "arth" ko spasht karne main vyavahaarwad kii vidhi kaa prayog kiya, james ne "satya kaa swaroop nirnit karne main ise bartaa, diu ne "bhadra" par ise lagu kiya
 In this way they brought justice, aesthetics and policy closer to empiricism
 peers ne nae vichaar ko "pregmetism" kaa naam diya
 He strongly believed that philosophy should adopt the approach of science and its method
 darshan ke liye satya gyaan nirpeksh yaa samgr kaa dosharahit gyaan he; vigyaan kii drushti main aisa gyaan maanav buddhi ke liye aprapya he
 We should be satisfied with relative knowledge, that is the object of our work
 darshan kaa pramukh kaam sweekrut manyataon ko siddh karnaa rahaa he, vigyaan ke liye avishkaar pramukh he

 kuch udaahranon kii neenv par pratigya kii jaati he, use satya maanakar nishkarsh nikaale jate hai or ant main dekha jaataa he ki anubhav inaki pushti karata he yaa nahin
 Such confirmation of a promise is its truth
 prayek satya kii sthiti samayik pratigya kii sthiti he
 Natural laws are also not permanent, they are also under development
 aakarshanyim kaa kshetra ab pehle se adhik vistrut he or bhavishya main vartmaan se bhi adhik vistrut ho jayega
 Rules are also confirmed as habits
 james ne amoort satya ko nahin, apitu vishesh vishwaason ke satya ko apane vivechan kaa vishay banaaya
 According to his opinion, truth is not a permanent thing, which is our job to see, it becomes in action
 apni pustak "vyavahaarwad" main vah kahata he- "pragmatism is, basically, the rule to erase philosophical disputes that would have been inherent without it
 jagat ek he yaa anek? swadhin he yaa paradheen? prakritik he yaa aadhyatmik? ye vichaar aise hai jinamein ek yaa doosraa satya yaa asaty ho saktaa he or aise vichaaron par vivaadon kaa koi ant nahin
 The method of behaviorism in relation to these topics is that we solve each suffix by testing its practical results
 yadi koi pratyay duusare pratyay ke sthaan main satya hota, to isse kisi manushya ke liye vyaavhaarik bhed kya padataa? yadi koi vyaavhaarik bhed dikhaai na de to vyavhaar main donon pakshaantar ek hi hai or sara vivaad vyarth he
 When a dispute is serious, we should be able to show that there is a practical distinction between the two sides if one or the other is true "
 james se bahut pehle isi bhav ko prakat karte hue ramanuj ne kaha tha-"vyavhaar yogyata satyam"
 Pragmatism is utilitarianism in epistemology: "anything that proves itself valuable in relation to faith is truth
" vyavahaarwad bina jhijak ke yah maan letaa he ki jo vishwaas ek ke liye satya he, vah duusare ke liye asaty ho saktaa he
 It is said above that pragmatism gives more importance to the special than the general and the change to the stability
 diu kii shiksha main ham ise spasht dekhte hai
 In politics, there is a distinction between monarchy, aristocracy and democracy
 rajtantr or shishtjanatantr adhik safal hon, to bhi prajatantr unase acha he, kyonki yah vyakti ke mulya ko sweekaar karata he
 In the policy, some refer to the rule of administration and some to the achievement of credit
 diu ke anusaar donon varg ek hi bhranti main pade hai; ve vishesh ko uchit mahatv nahin dete
 The policy should accept not one but many rules, not one but many practitioners
 uddeshy har haalat main vartmaan kathinaayee ko dur karnaa hota he; jo kriya isamen adhik se adhik sahaayak ho, vahi us sthiti main sarvshereshth he
 a man is situated anywhere, he is a good man if he is moving forward, a bad man if he is moving back
 jivan kaa ekmaatr lakshya utthan yaa vruddhi he; purnataa nahin, apitu purnataa kii ore nirantar gati he
 This pace is education, moral life and education are the same thing
 prachlit vichaar ke anusaar shikshakaal taiyaari kaa samay he; yah vyakti ko paradheenata se vimukt karke swadhin bana detaa he
 If this is the case, then there is no need for education at the end of the term
 diu kahata he ki vruddhi kaa ytn to jivan ke ant tak jari rahanaa chahie, sara jivan hi shikshakaal he
 In some schools which are taught in colleges, science should get more importance than knowledge of literature and languages
 vigyaan main bhi jo bhaag pustakon se praapt hota he, usase adhik mulya us bhaag kaa he jo vidhyaarthee apni kriya se sikhta he
 It is not the mind of man but the weapon of action
 vastav main anurupatavaad, avirodhwaad or vyavahaarwad ek hi prashn kaa uttar nahin
 Two questions demand answers - What does truth mean? What is the criterion to distinguish between truth and untruth? Conformityism answers the first question; Irrationalism and pragmatism answer the second question
 james ne kaha he ki vyavhaar kii drushti main jab koi vishwaas satya siddh hota he, to uske liye aavashyak he ki vah usee prakaar ke satyon se yukt ho sake
 This notion brings behavior closer to antisemitism
 teenon vichaar ek duusare ke viruddh nahin, ek duusare ke poorak hai

 protein, jaivik sthooaanuon ke ek mahatvapurn varg hai jo sabhi jaivik avyavon main maujuud hote hai or mukhya rup se carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur tatwon se bane hote hai
 All proteins are polymers of amino acids
 apane bhautik aakaar dwaara vargeekrut kiye jane vaale protein, nanokan hai 
 prayek protein bahulak - jise polypeptid ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he - 20 alag-alag L-α amino acid ke anukram se bane hote hai, jinhen avshesh ke rup main bhi uddhrut kiya jaataa he
 The term peptide is often used instead of protein for chains under 40 residues
 apane jaivik kaaryon ko sampadit karne main sakasham hone ke liye, protein, ek yaa ek se adhik vishisht sthanik rachana main bikhar jate hai, jo kai gaiyr-sahasanyojak antarkriya dwaara sanchalit hote hai jaise hydrogen bonding, ynic antarkriya, vaan der vals bal or jalabhitik packing
 ek aanvik str par protein ke kaaryon ko samajhane ke liye, unki tri-aiami sanrachana ko nirdhaarit karnaa aksar aavashyak hota he
 It is the subject of the scientific field of structural biology, which applies techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and dual polarization interference measurements to determine the structure of proteins
 ek vishesh jaev rasinic kriya sampadit karne ke liye avshesh kii kuch vishisht sankhya kii aavashyak hoti he or kareeb 40-50 avshesh, kaaryaatmak domen aakaar ke liye nichali seemaa prathit hote hai
 Protein sizes range from this low range to several thousand residues in multifunctional or structural proteins
 haalanki, protein kii ausat lambaai kaa vartmaan akalan 300 avshesh ke aas-paas he
 Very large aggregates can be formed from a protein subunit: for example, several thousand actin molecules collected in a microfilament
 jeev rasayan-vigyaan, ek protein sanrachana ke chaar alag pahaluon ko darshata he: In addition to these levels of structure, a protein can shift between several similar structures, editing its biological functions
 yah prakriya palat bhi sakati he
 These tertiary or quaternary structures are generally referred to as chemical compositions in the context of these functional rearrangements and the transition between them is called conformational change
 praathmik sanrachana, kovailint yaa peptid bond dwaara bandhi rahati he, jinka nirmaan protein biosinthasis yaa udgrahan kii prakriya ke dauraan hota he
 These peptide bonds provide stiffness to the protein
 amino acid shrinkhalaa ke do chor ko C-terminal chor yaa carboxyle terminus kaha jaataa he or N-terminal chor yaa amino terminus, prayek chor par mukt samooh kii prakruti ke aadhaar par
 Different types of secondary structure are defined by the method of hydrogen bonds between peptide groups of the main chain
 haalanki, ye hydrogen bond aam taur par khud main sthir nahin hote hai, kyonki jal-tiktey hydrogen bond, aam taur par tiktey-tiktey hydrogen bond kii tulana main adhik anukool hote hai
 Thus, the secondary structure is stable only when the local concentration of water is sufficiently low, for example, in the molten ring or in a completely double state
 isi tarah, pighali hui golikaa kaa gathan or tritiyak sanrachana, mukhya rup se sanrachanaatmak aadhaar par gaiyr-vishisht antarkriya dwaara prerit hoti he, jaise amino acid or jalabhitik antarkriya kii rukhi pravriti
 haalanki, tritiyak sanrachana sirf tabhi nishchit hoti he jab ek protein domen ke hisse sanrachanaatmak aadhaar par vishisht antarkriya dwaara jagah par band kar die jate hai, jaise ynic antarkriya, hydrogen bond or paksh shrinkhalaa kii tang packing
 bahya-kosiya protein kii tritiyak sanrachana ko bhi dislphide bond dwaara sthir kiya ja saktaa he, jo bina doharaav kii sthiti kii antropy ko kam kar detaa he; dislphide bond, citosolic protein main atyant durlabh hai, kyonki citosol, aam taur par ek newnikaran maahaul he
 The sequence of different amino acids is called the primary structure of a protein or peptide
 avasheshon kii ginati hameshaa N-terminal chor par shuru hoti he, vah chor, jahaan amino samooh, peptid bond main shaamil he
 The primary structure of a protein is determined by the gene that coincides with that protein
 DNA main newcliotide kaa ek vishisht anukram mrna main pratirupit hota he, jise roopantaran kahi jane vaali ek prakriya main ribosome dwaara padhaa jaataa he
 The sequence of a protein is unique to that protein and defines the structure and function of that protein
 ek protein ke anukram ko adman digradation yaa tendom maas spectrometry jaise tareekon dwaara nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 But often, it is read directly from the sequence of the gene that uses the genetic code
 roopantaran-pashchaat ke sanshodhan, jaise dislphide nirmaan, phosforilation or glikojailation ko bhi aam taur par praathmik sanrachana kaa ek hissaa mana jaataa he or use jin se nahin padhaa ja saktaa he
 The first elements of the secondary structure, the alpha helix and the beta sheet, were suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and co-workers, by building models of peptides using known information such as bond length and angle
 in do madhyamik sanrachana tatwon main prayek ke paas ek niyamit jyamiti he, jiskaa arth he ki ve deehydral kone ψ or φ ke vishisht mulya se bandhe hai
 Thus, they can be found in a particular area of the Ramachandran plot
 alpha heliks or beta shit, donon hi peptid ridh main sabhi hydrogen bond daataaon or swikaarkartaaon ko trupt karne kaa ek tarika pradarshit karte hai
 These secondary structure elements depend only on the properties of the polypeptide main chain, explaining why they are present in all proteins
 protein kaa vah hissaa jo niyamit madhyamik sanrachana main nahin he, use ek "gaiyr-niyamit sanrachana" kaha jaataa he 
 usee heliks ke kuch or nirupan ko dayee taraf dikhaaya gaya he
 Elements of secondary structure are typically folded into a solid shape, using a variety of knots and bends
 madhyamik sanrachanaayen, supermadhymik sanrachanaon ke gathan ke liye hydrogen bond dwaara bandha jate hai jaise greek kii
 ek vistrut udhaaharan ke liye dekhen supermadhymik sanrachana
yah bhi kai vaigyanikon dwaara sujhaayaa gaya he ki madhyamik sanrachana keval amino acid anukram ke dwaara hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 Elements of secondary structure are typically folded into a solid shape, using a variety of knots and bends
 tritiyak sanrachana kaa nirmaan aam taur par jalabhitik avshesh ke dafan dwaara prerit hota he, lekin anya antarkriya jaise hydrogen bonding, ynic antarkriya or dislphide bond bhi tritiyak sanrachana ko sthir kar sakate hai
 The tertiary structure includes all non-covalent interactions that are not considered to be secondary structures and that define the overall fold of the protein and are generally indispensable for the protein's actions
 chaturdhatuk sanrachana, peptid bond kii kai shrinkhalaaon ke bich antarkriya he
 Individual series are called subunits
 vyaktigat up-ikai aam taur par sahasanyojak tareeke se nahin judi hoti he, lekin ek dislphide bond se judi ho sakati he
 Not all proteins have a quaternary structure, as they can be functional like monomers
 chaturdhatuk sanrachana ko usee shrenee kii antarkriya dwaara sthir kiya jaataa he jisase tritiyak sanrachana ko kiya jaataa he
 Packages of two or more polypeptides are called multimers
 vishesh rup se yadi isamen do upikai he to ise ek dimar kaha jayega, agar teen upikai shaamil he to trimer or chaar upikai ke shaamil hone par tetramar kaha jayega
 ye upikaiyaan ek-duusare se aam taur par samarupata dhuree dwaara sambandhit hai, jaise dimar main ek 2-fold dhuree
 samaan upikaayiyon se bane multimer ko ek "homo-" upsarg ke saath sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he or jo alag-alag upikaayiyon se bane hote hai unhen ek "hetro-" upsarg ke saath sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he 
 An α-amino acid is made up of a portion that is present in all types of amino acids and from a side chain that is unique to each type of residue
 Cα parmaanu, 4 bhinn parmaanuon se bandhe hote hai: ek hydrogen parmaanu, ek amino samooh nitrogen, ek carboxyle samooh carbon or is prakaar ke amino acid ke liye vishesh ek said chen carbon
 is niyam kaa apwaad he proline, jahaan hydrogen parmaanu, paksh kii shrinkhalaa par ek bond dwaara pratisthapit kiya jaataa he
 Because the carbon atom is bound to four different groups with which it is chiral, but only one of the isotopes is present in the biological protein
 glysin haalanki, kiral nahin he kyonki isaki paksh shrinkhalaa ek hydrogen parmaanu he
 a simple mnemonic for the correct L-form is "CORN": when the Cα atom is viewed with h in front, the residue is clockwise "CO-RN"
 paksh shrinkhalaa, α-amino acid ke rasinic gun ko nirdhaarit karata he or 20 vibhinn paksh shrinkhalaa ke kisi bhi ek ko: The naturally occurring 20 amino acids can be divided into several groups based on their chemical properties
 mahatvapurn karkon main he charge, hydrophobicity / hydrophilicity, aakaar or kaaryaatmak samooh
 jaleey paryaavaran ke saath vibhinn paksh shrinkhalaa kii antarkriya kii prakruti, protein sanrachana ko dhaalane main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaati he
 The hydrophobic side chain is buried in the middle of the protein, while the hydrophilic side chain remains in contact with the solvent
 hydrophobic avasheshon ke udhaaharan hai: lucin, isolucin, fenilelanin or vaaleen or ek had tak tirocine, elanin or tripatophan
 paksh shrinkhalaa kaa charge protein sanrachanaon main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, kyonki aayan bonding protein sanrachanaon ko sthir kar saktaa he or protein ke bich main ek gaiyr-yugmit charge sanrachana ko baadhit kar saktaa he
 Charged residues are much more hydrophilic and are typically found on the outside of the protein
 dhanatmak rup se charge paksh shrinkhalaa, lysin or arginin main pai jaati he or kuch maamalon main histydin main
 rinatmak charge glutamet or asprtate main paae jate hai
 The remaining amino acids typically have short hydrophilic side chains with different functional groups
 cerin or threonin main hydroxil samooh hota he or espargin or glutamin main amide samooh hota he
 Some amino acids have special properties, such as cysteine, which can form covalent disulfide bonds with other cysteine, proline that are cyclic, and glycine which is shorter and more flexible than other amino acids
 do amino acid ko sankshepan abhikriya main sanyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 By repeating this reaction, a long chain of residues can be generated
 yah abhikriya ribosome dwaara utprerit hoti he or us prakriya ko roopantaran ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Peptide bonds are actually planar due to the non-localization of electrons from double bonds
 kathor peptid dihedral kone, ω hameshaa 180 degree ke nazadik hota he
 The dihedral angle phi φ and psi ψ may have a certain range of possible values
 ye kone ek protein kii swatantraaa ke str hai, ve protein kii teen aiami sanrachana kaa niyantran karte hai
 They are limited by geometry to allow specific ranges for specific secondary structure elements and are displayed in the Ramachandran plot
 kuch mahatvapurn bond lambaai neeche talika main di gai he
 Atoms along side chains are named in Greek alphabetical order by Greek letters: α, β, γ, δ, є and so on
 Cα refers to the carbon atom of the backbone that is closest to the carbonyl group of that amino acid, Cβ, the second closest and so on
 The Cα is a part of the backbone, while the Cβ and the outside atoms form the side chain
 in parmaanuon ke bich bond ke aasapaas ke dihedral kone ko χ1, χ2, χ3 aadi naam diya gaya he
 The dehedral angle of the first dynamic atom of the side chain, γ { \ displaystyle \ gamma}, defined as NC α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} -C β { \ displaystyle \ beta} - x γ { \ displaystyle x \ gamma} As, he is named χ1
 Most of the side chains may be in a different composition called gausch, trance and gausch
 paksh shrinkhalaa, aam taur par compit rachana main χ2 ke aasapaas aane kaa ek prayaas karti hai, jo pratisthaapan parmaanuon ke electron kakshiya ke bich overlap ke newnikaran dwaara prerit hoti he
 The variety of side-chain compositions is often expressed in the Rotamer library
 ek rotaamar librari, paksh-shrinkhalaa swatantraaa ke str vaale protein main prayek prakaar ke avshesh ke liye rotamars kaa sangrah he
 Rotamer libraries typically contain information about both the composition and the frequency of a certain composition
 librariyon main aksar dihedral kone tareeke yaa paddati ke bare main vicharan ke bare main jaankaree shaamil hoti he, jise namoonon main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Side-chain dehedral angles are not uniformly distributed, but for most side-chain types, χ { \ displaystyle \ chi} angles exist around a certain value and in tight groups
 rotaamar librariyon ko isliye aam taur par protein kii gyaat sanrachanaon main paksh-shrinkhalaa rachana ke sankhyikeey vishleshan se nikaala jaataa he jiske liye pai gai rachana ko ikaitha kiya jaataa he yaa dihedral kone sthaan ko bin main vibhajit karke or phir prayek bin main ek ausat rachana kaa nirdhaaran karke
 yah vibhaajan aam taur par bhautik, rasinic aadhaar par hota he, jaisaa ki SP3-SP3 bond ke roteshan kaa 120° bin main vibhaajan jo prayek compit rachana par kendrit hota he 
 Rotamer libraries can be spine-independent, secondary-structure dependent, or spine-dependent
 bhed ko is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki kya rotaamar ke liye dihedral kone or / yaa unki aavritiyaan sthaneey ridh rachana par nirbhar karti hai yaa nahin
 Spine-independent rotamer libraries do not refer to backbone design and are calculated from a certain type of available side-chain
 madhyamik-sanrachana par nirbhar librariyaan, bhinn dihedral kone or / yaa α { \ displaystyle \ alpha } -heliks, β { \ displaystyle \ beta } -shit ke liye rotaamar aavritiyaan yaa coil madhyamik sanrachanaon ko prastut karti hai
 Spine-dependent rotameter libraries are composed and / or localized frequencies dependent spine composition as defined by the spine dehedral angles φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} and ψ { \ displaystyle \ psi}, regardless of the secondary structure
 Finally, a variant of the spine-dependent rotamer library exists as a position-specific rotamer, typically defined by fragments with a length of 5 amino acids, where the side chain conformation of the central residue is investigated
 kai protein, kai ikaayiyon main vyavasthit hote hai
 a structural domain is the element of the overall structure of a protein that is self-stable and often turns independently from the rest of the protein chain
 kai domen, ek jin yaa jin parivaar ke protein utpaadon ke liye anokhe nahin hote hai balki vibhinn protein main dikhaai dete hai
 Domains are often named and excluded because they are predominantly present in the biological functions of the proteins under which they belong; For example "calmodulin's calcium-binding domain"
 Because they are self-stable, domains can be "changed" from one protein to another to create chimeras, by genetic engineering
 is arth main ek roopankan, sanrachanaatmak madhyamik tatwon ke ek chote vishisht sangyojan ko darshata he 
 in tatwon ko aksar supermadhymik sanrachana kaha jaataa he
 Fold refers to a global type of arrangement, such as a helix bundle or beta-barrel
 Structure motifs typically consist of only a few elements, such as 'helix-turn-helix' with only three
 dhyaan den ki jabaki ek roopankan ke sabhi udaahranon main tatwon ke sthanik anukram samaan hai, antarnihit jin ke bheetar unhen kisi bhi kram main kutit kiya ja saktaa he
 Structural protein motifs often include loops of variable length and unspecified structure, which in effect creates a "slack" that is required to replace the two elements that are not encoded by the most adjacent DNA sequence
 yah bhi dhyaan den he ki yahaan tak ki, jab do jin, ek hi kram main ek roopankan ke madhyamik sanrachanaatmak tatwon ko kutit karte hai, tab par bhi ve amino acid ke, kuch had tak bhinn conukram ko nirdisht kar sakate hai
 This is true not only because of the complex relationship between tertiary and primary structure, but because the size of the elements changes from one protein to another
 is tathy ke baavjood ki ucariotic system main kareeb 100,000 protein vyakt kiye gaye hai, vahaan apekshaakrit kam bhinn domen, sanrachanaatmak roopankan or mode hai
 This is partly a result of evolution, as genes and parts of genes can be doubled or run within the genome
 iskaa matlab he ki, udhaaharan ke liye, ek protein domen ko ek protein se duusare main le jaaya ja saktaa he or is prakaar protein ko ek nayaa kaary saunpa ja saktaa he
 Because of these mechanisms, pathways and mechanisms can be reused in many different proteins
