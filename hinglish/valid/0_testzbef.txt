 isamen aganit adbhut samathyaryukt kendra hai
 These centers can be divided into three major classes
 jo kaaya main chalane vaali nimarn prakriya kaa niyantran sanchaalan karte hai
 Who are responsible for the affirmation, nutrition, health, health related processes in the Institute
 jo vikaron ke nishkasana parivatarn or vikaas kram kaa niyantran karte hai
 Carries out the cycle of action
 yah kendra kramshah brahma, vishnu or rudra se sambaddh maane jate hai
 These centers are developed to resemble their presiding deities, so by dividing the head hair into three parts, they tie them in three bunches from the Kulva bandha
 ye hisse hai-saamne ek, peeche daayen or baanye bhaag alag-alag
 The last right bunch is called Brahma-gland, the last left bunch is Vishnu Granthi and the front one is called Rudra Granthi

 It is difficult to maintain the Triveni Yoga of auspiciousness, purity and a magnificent process for the elimination of undesired malpractices from various centers of the brain and for the awakening of auspiciousness
 ek-ek karke mantron ke kram se nidharrit kendron ko kalave se bandha jaae
 The corresponding sense should be made
 sir ke pichley bhaag main daayin ore ke baalo main mantra ke saath kalava baandhe
 Realize that with the power of Brahma, the symbol of the power of the brain, is being committed to witnessing the gods

 The purpose of this worship is that instead of simple iron tools, this razor can be filled with mantra power and can cut the kuskars of the brain and enter the greetings in it
 garbh main aane vaale bal saamaanya sanskaar vaale hote hai
 After removing this covering, hair should be grown in its place, which should bring excellent feelings with it

 Similarly, to uproot undesirable thoughts and habits, the spiritual ideology of creation has to be developed at a fiery level
 praarambhik baalo ko isi bhaavana ke saath kaata jaataa he
 The scissor-knife should be worshiped by the guardian along with the mantraochar placed in the plate
 ve bhaavana karen ki balak ke kuvicharon ko kaatane ke liye, unki kaat karne main samarth paine upkaran-sadvicharon kii abhyarthna kar rahe hai

 Astu, he is not allowed to nurture selfish aspirations, they should be cut
 ishwaronmukh aakankshaon ke poshan ke liye hi shakti surakshit rahe
 Rudra gland cuttings means that every tendency which is hindering the growth of Goddess Mayarda should be severely curtailed

 Throw away Ashiva vrittis to Shiva's power

 The National Telecommunication Policy, 1994 has also acknowledged that the resources required to achieve these goals will not be available only from government sources and it has been concluded that to meet this gap of resources private Investment and private sector participation were required

 According to cellular and basic service operators, the main reason for this is that these projects are recovering much less revenue than anticipated and as a result, the operators are unable to finance their projects and hence do not complete their projects
 Are getting nijee prachaalkon dwaara license praapt 6 cirkilon main se keval do main hi buniyadi doorsanchaar sevaayen shuru kii gayi hai
 Due to this, some of the goals as proposed in the objectives of the National Telecommunication Policy, 1994 could not be met

 Main Principles Some of the main principles of Pakhtunavali are as follows
 1
 melmestiyansnelmstia – dayaa, meharbaani va mehmaannawaazi sabhi paradesiyon va ajanabiyon par dikhaaya janaa
 There should be no discrimination on the basis of religion, caste, ethnic nationality etc

 2
 nanavatai:- Nanawatai – agar koi apane dushmano se bachaane ke liye madad va sangrakshan maange to unhen sangrakshan diya janaa chaiye
 They are protected at all costs
 un logon ko bhi jo kaanoon se bhaag rahe hon us samay takh sangrakshan diya janaa chaiye jab tak ki vastusthiti saafe nahin ho jaati
 They are also protected when the defeated side goes to the winner
 kai maamalon main aatm samarpan karke apane dushman ke hi ghar main sharan lee jaati he
 3
 Change - blood for blood, eye for eye, tooth for tooth
 aisa patit hota he ki yah maaf kar dene, dayaa karne ke siddhanth ke vipareet he
 But due to such lack of understanding, wrong fahmings arise
 maafi ke liye zaruri he, ki galati karne vaala aafi maange
 How sorry without asking? It is applicable to all types of crimes and crimes
 chaahe galat kaam kal kiya gaya tha, chaahe ek hazaar saal pehle kiya gaya ho
 If the wrongdoer is not alive then he will be avenged from the one who is close to his blood
 4

 Any person born in India on or after 1 July 1947 is a citizen of India if one of his parents at the time of his birth was a citizen of India
 7 janvari 2004 ke baad bharat main paidaa hua vah koi bhi vyakti bharat kaa naagarik mana jaataa he, yadi uske donon abhibhavak bharat ke naagarik hon athwa yadi ek abhibhavak bhartiya ho or doosraa abhibhavak uske janm ke samay par gaiyr kanoonee apravasi na ho, to vah naagarik bhartiya yaa videshi ho saktaa he
 Persons born outside India after 26 January 1950 but before 10 December 1992 are citizens of India by descent if their father was a citizen of India at the time of their birth
 10 disambar 1992 ko yaa iske baad bharat main paidaa hua vyakti bharat kaa naagarik he yadi uske janm ke samay koi ek abhibhavak bharat kaa naagarik tha
 From 3 December 2004 onwards, a person born outside India will not be considered a citizen of India if their birth is not registered with the Indian Consulate within a period of one year after birth
 In certain circumstances, registration can be done after a period of 1 year with the permission of the Central Government
 ek bhartiya vaanijya duutavas main ek avyask bachche ke janm ke panjikaran ke liye aavedan dene ke saath abhibhavakon ko likhit main upkram ko yah bataanaa hota he ki is bachche ke paas kisi or desh kaa passport nahin he
 The Central Government, on application, can register a person as a citizen of India under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act 1955 if it falls under one of the following categories: - ek videshi naagarik sameekaran ke dwaara bharat kii naagarikta praapt kar saktaa he jo baarah saal se bharat main rah rahaa ho
 iske liye aavashyak he ki aavedak 7 saal kii avadhi main kul 4 saal ke liye bharat main rahaa ho or aavedan se pehle usne 12 maheene kaa samay bharat main vyateet kiya ho
 On 26 November 1949, the people domiciled in the territory of India automatically became citizens of India as per the consistent provisions of the Indian Constitution
 
bhartiya samvidhan ne pakistan ke un kshetron se aane vaale apravasiyon kii naagarikta ke sambandh main bhi praavdhaan banaaye hai, jo vibhaajan se pehle bharat kaa hissaa the
 The renunciation of citizenship is covered under section 8 of the Citizenship Act 1955
 yadi ek vayask bhartiya naagarikta ke tyaag kii ghoshnaa karata he, vah bhartiya naagarikta kho detaa he
 Also from the date of renunciation, the minor child of such person also loses Indian citizenship
 jab baccha atharah saal kii umr main pahunchataa he, use phir se bhartiya naagarikta praapt karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 The declaration of renunciation under the Indian citizenship law requires that the person making the declaration be "full of age and ability"
 naagarikta kii samaapti ko naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 9 main cover kiya gaya he
 The provisions for termination are different and differentiated from the provision for declaration of renunciation
 adhinium kii dhara 9 ke anusaar bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo panjikaran yaa sameekaran ke dwaara kisi or desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaaegi
 isamen yah bhi praavdhaan he ki bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo swechha se kisi duusare desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaayegi
vishesh rup se, samaapti kaa praavdhaan tyaag ke praavdhaan se alag he, kyonki yah "bharat ke kisi bhi naagarik " par lagu hota he or vayaskon ke liye hi pratibandhit nahin he
 That is why Indian children also automatically lose their Indian citizenship if at any time after their birth they acquire citizenship of another country, for example, by equation or registration - whether any other citizenship is acquired by the child's parents
 Why not be the result of the action of naagarikta niyam 1956 ke anusaar kisi or desh kaa passport praapt karnaa bhi us desh kii rashtriyata kaa svaichhik adhigrahan he
 According to Rule 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, "the fact that a citizen of India has on some date obtained a passport from the government of another country will be conclusive proof that he has voluntarily granted the citizenship of that country Is derived from " ek baar phir se, yah niyam lagu hota he yadi bachche ke liye uske abhibhavakon ke dwaara videshi passport praapt kiya gaya he or chaahe is tarah ke passport ko praapt karnaa kisi anya desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar aavashyak ho, jo bachche ko apana ek naagarik maanata he 
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki us vyakti ke paas abhi bhi bhartiya passport he
 a person who acquires another citizenship loses Indian citizenship from the same day he acquired the citizenship or passport of another country
 british rajanyik padon ke liye ek prachlit abhyaas he, udahaaran ke liye, us aavedakon se bhartiya passport ko zabt kar bhartiya praadhikaranon ko lautaa diya jaye, jo british passport ke liye aavedan karte hai, yaa jinhone ise praapt kar liya he
 There are special rules for Indian citizens regarding Goa, Daman and Diu
 naagarikta niyam, 1956 kii anusuchee ke niyam 3A ke anusaar, "ek vyakti jo naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 7 ke tahat jari, daadaraa or nagar haveli aadesh 1962, athwa goa, daman or div aadesh 1962 ke aadhaar par bhartiya naagarik ban gaya he or uske paas kisi anya desh ke dwaara jari kiya yaa passport he, tathy ki usne 19 janvari 1963 se pehle apana passport nahin lautaaya he, yah is baat kaa nirnaayak pramaan hoga ki usne is dinaank se pehle swechha se us desh kii naagarikta ko praapt kar liya he
 On 16 February 1962, the Bench of the Supreme Court of India stated in the case of Izhar Ahmed Khan v
 Union of India that "if it is found that the person has acquired foreign citizenship by equation or registration, there is no doubt that As a result of type equation or registration, he will no longer be a citizen of India
 yah bhartiya rashtriyata kaa ek rup he, jiske dharak ko bharat kaa videshi naagarik kaha jaataa he
 The Indian constitution rejects dual citizenship or dual nationality, exceptions from the point where minor citizenship is obtained spontaneously
 bhartiya praadhikaranon ne is kanoon kii vyakhya kii he ki ek vyakti kisi duusare desh kaa passport nahin rakh saktaa agar uske paas bhartiya passport he- yahaan tak ki ek bachche ke maamle main jise anya desh ke dwaara uskaa naagarik hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he or aisa ho saktaa he ki us desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar us bachche ko videsh yatra karne ke liye us desh ke passport kii aavashyaktaa ho - or bhartiya adaalaton ne is maamle par kaaryakari shakha vistrut vivek diya he
 Therefore, the foreign citizenship of India is not a full citizenship of India and thus it denies dual citizenship or dual nationality
 bharat kii kendriya sarkaar ek vyakti ko aavedan par, bharat ke ek videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut kar sakati he yadi vah vyakti bhartiya mul kaa he or aise desh se he jo kisi ek yaa anya rup main dohari naagarikta kii anumati detaa he
 Broadly speaking, "a person of Indian origin" is a citizen of another country who: dhyaan den ki bhartiya mata pita ke bachche swatah hi in aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karte or isliye swatah osiai ke paatr nahin hai
 Indian Missions have been authorized to grant foreign citizenship of India within 30 days in cases where no serious crime is involved such as drug trafficking, moral turpitude, terrorist activities or any activities that have caused more than one year There can be jail
 videshi bhartiya naagarikta un logon ko nahin di ja sakati, jinhone videshi rashtriyata ko praapt kiya he, yaa praapt karne kii yojana bana rahen hai, athwa unke paas bhartiya passport bhi he
 This law requires that an Indian national who takes a foreign nationality must immediately return his / her Indian passport
 Those who are eligible for it can apply for registration of foreign Indian citizenship
 bharat ke videshi nagarikon ko bhartiya passport karne kii koi yojana nahin he, haalanki panjikaran kaa praaanpatr passport jaisi pustika main hoga mantriparishad ne bharat ke panjikrut videshi nagarikon ko biometric smart card dene ke prastaav par kaam karne ke liye bhartiya videsh mantralay ko dishanirdesh bhi die hai
 a foreign national of India can enjoy all the rights and privileges available to non-nris on the basis of parity
 isamen krishi evam vriksharopan sampatti main nivesh karne yaa saarvajanik karyaalay rakhane kaa adhikaar shaamil nahin he
 a person is required to keep his existing foreign passport which should include a new visa called a 'U' visa, which is a multi-purpose, multi-entry, visa and lasts a lifetime
 iske saath bharat kaa videshi naagarik kabhi bhi, kisi bhi prayojan ke liye, kitni bhi samay avadhi ke liye desh kaa daura kar saktaa he
 a Vietnamese citizen of India will not be able to enjoy the following rights even while living in India: Right to vote, President's office, Vice President's office, Supreme Court and High Court judges, members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Vidhan Sabha or Legislative Council The right to become, the right to appoint in public services
 Also, foreign nationals of India are not eligible for inner line permit
 If they want to travel to some special places in India, they have to apply for a protected area permit
 ek dilachasp sawaal yah he ki bharat ke videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut ek vyakti bharat main rahete hue apane desh ke rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar kho degaa
1930 ke rashtriyata kanoon ke sangharsh se sambandhit vishesh sawaalon par hegg sammelan kaa anuchhed 4 kahata he ki "ek rajya apane kisi vyakti ko aise rajya ke khilaaf rajanyik sangrakshan pradaan nahin kar saktaa jisaki rashtriyata aise vyaktiyon ke paas bhi ho
 yah maamla do chizon par nirbhar karata he: pehla, kya bharat kii sarkaar bharat ke videshi naagarikta ko sachhee naagarikta maanati he or is aadhaar par duusare desh ke dwaara rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar samaapt ho jaataa he; or doosraa, kya vyakti kaa apana desh ise pahachaanata he or bharat kii asweekruti ko sweekaar karata he
 Both points are questionable
 bharat videshi nagarikon ko ek swatantra yatra dastavej nahin detaa he parantu iske bajaay duusare desh ke passport main ek vija rakh detaa he
 If a person is only eligible to hold a passport from another country but cannot retain any form of Indian travel document, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the person is the only citizen of another country for the purpose of diplomatic protection
 bharat kii videshi naagarikta praapt karne par, british naagarik 1981 ke british rashtriyata adhinium kii dhara 4B ke tahat purna british naagarik ke rup main panjikaran nahin karvaa sakate
 yah unhen ek alag tareeke se purna british naagarikta praapt karne se nahin roak saktaa or yah unki british naagarikta ko radd nahin karata yadi ve dhara 4B ke tahat pehle se panjikrut hai
 The Public Information Bureau of India issued a press release which on 29 June 2005 clarified India's foreign citizenship scheme
 osiai yojana kaa purna vivaran bharat sarkaar ke grih mantralay web pej par uplabdh he
 Many other articles have also been written, including: osiai card bhartiya vija kaa vikalp nahin he or isliye osiai dharakon ko bharat main yatra karte samay vah passport apane paas rakhana chahie jo jivan bhar ke vija ko darshata he
 Although a dual citizenship is not fully developed, an OCI card holder has the privilege that multinational companies currently prefer to hire an OCI card holder for a multi-purpose and multi-entry lifetime tour of India
 Have a visa
 yah card dharak ko ek aaajeevan vija pradaan karata he, iske alaava ve alag se kaam karne kaa permit bhi praapt kar lete hai
 OCI holders are treated like nris in economic, financial and educational matters and do not have only political rights, do not have the right to purchase agricultural and plantation property or hold public office
 They do not even have to undergo registration with the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer on arrival in the country and can stay here for as long as they want
 osiai card dharak aaraam se yatra kar sakate heim or bharat main kaam le sakate hai, jabaki anya ko rojgaar vija par beurocratic deree hone par pakadaa ja saktaa he
 Many companies are following an active policy of PIO migration to expand their business

 Any person who currently has a non-indian passport who can authenticate their Indianness up to three generations ago
 yahi niyam ek bhartiya naagarik ke jivan saathi par or bhartiya mul ke vyaktiyon par lagu hota he
 Citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries are not eligible to obtain a card of Indian origin as specified by the Central Government
 ek piaio card aam taur par jari hone kii tithi se pandrah varsh kii avadhi tak vaidya hota he

 dekhen british rashtriyata kanoon
 1 janvari 1949 or 25 janvari 1950 ke bich, bhartiya naagarikta ke bina british ke adheen rahete the, jab tak ve pehle se sanyukt raashtra or upniveshon yaa anya rashtramandal deshon kii naagarikta praapt nahin kar lete the
 When the Indian Constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, under the British Nationality Act, a person who became an Indian citizen also had the status of a Commonwealth citizen in terms of Indian membership of the Commonwealth and his Indian citizenship
 However, innumerable Indians did not obtain Indian citizenship when the Indian Constitution came into force and they remained under the British without citizenship status until they acquired citizenship of another Commonwealth country
 Any person who is subject to only one British will automatically lose British subordination after acquiring Indian citizenship or any other nationality including Indian foreign citizenship
 british ke adheen log sanyukt raashtra main na rahete hue bhi british rashtriyata adhinium kii dharaa 4B ke tahat british naagarik ke rup main panjikaran karvaa sakate hai yadi unke paas koi or rashtriyata yaa naagarikta nahin he or unhone 4 july 2002 ke baad kisi naagarikta yaa rashtriyata kaa swechha se tyaag nahin kiya he
 This facility is available from 30 April 2003 onwards
 ve log jo sanyukt raashtra main pravasit ho gaye hai, unke paas british naagarikta praapt karne kaa ek atirikt vikalp hota he, jise aamtaur par praathamikta di jaati he kyonki ve sthaanantaran yogya british naagarikta uplabdh dete hai
 The meaning of the term British subjugation changed from 1949, it is now more than a person holding citizenship of a Commonwealth country
 keval usee vyakti ko british passport diya jaataa tha jo bina naagarikta ke british ke adheen he
 See the British subject vartmaan main prayek duutavas ke apane maanak or niyam hai, jinka niyantran nayi dilli main kiya jaataa he, iske liye prakriya samaan he

 sabhi stambh bharne ke baad form par hastakshar karen, iske baad aavedan ko osiai prabhag, dilli yaa epararo yaa nikatatam duutavas / vaanijya duutavas / ucch ayog ko bhej den
 aamtaur par agar aap dilli main aavedan karen to ek maah main aapako yah mil jaataa he
 This may vary among embassies, as all applications are finally approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs in Delhi
 kai maamalon main samay lag saktaa he kyoki agar adhikariyon ko zarurat mahasoos ho to osiai ko gahan satyaapan ke baad hi jari kiya jaataa he
 But it usually takes less than the immigrant visa approval time of the United States / United Nations or other Western countries
 america main bharat ke vaanijya duutavas general ne osiai aavednon kii handlling ko macers ko outsource karne kaa faisla kiya he trovisa outsorcing kii is prakriya ke behatar hone kii ummid he

 Saheb's opinion, there are three types, three nature, human beings by their primacy: ye hue chaar varna

 At that time, women were not outspoken in the society nor did women have the right to advocate
 par carnelia to ek junun kaa naam tha
 Due to his talent, he started giving legal advice to women and raised the demand to open a profession of advocacy for women
 Finally, after 1907, Cornelia was given the post of assistant female advocate in the courts of Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Assam
 ek lambi jaddojahad ke baad 1924 main mahilaon ko vakaalat se rokane vaale kanoon ko shithil kar unke liye bhi yah pesha khol diya gaya
 In 1929, Cornelia retired as a senior advocate of the High Court, but after that there was such an awakening among women that she began to express her voice by adopting advocacy as a profession

 tarang-kan dwaitata athwa tarang-kan dvitv siddhanth ke anusaar sabhi padaarthon main kan or tarang donon ke hi lakshan hote hai
 This is a fundamental principle in quantum engineering field of modern physics
 jis str par manushyon kii indriyaan duniya ko bhaanpati hai, us str par koi bhi vastu yaa to kan hoti he yaa tarang hoti he, lekin ek saath donon nahin hote
 This does not happen at the very microscopic level of atoms, and to understand physics here, it was found that objects and light sometimes show the nature of the particle and sometimes the wave
 is samay sthiti badi vilakshan he
 Some events make light appear to be wavelength and some appear particulate
 sambhavat: satya dwaitamay he
 Like both rupee pages, there are two different forms of light
 kintu hai donon hi satya
 The same has been found in relation to duality
 vah bhi kabhi tarangamay dikhaai detaa he or kabhi kanikamay
 Neither light nor both forms of matter can appear simultaneously at the same time
 ve paraspar virdohi, kintu poorak rup hai
 The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle presented his thinking about the nature of light, that light is a wave-like stimulus in air
 dusre unani chintak damokritus ne isse vipareet nazaraiya lete hue kaha ke brahmand main har chiz kanon ki bani he or yahi baat prakaash par bhi laghu hoti he
 This conflict continued until the nineteenth century
 tarangon kii ek ek visheshta he ke jab do yaa us se adhik shuddh tarange takaraati hai to ek vivartan kaa pattern yaa chitra bana leti hai
 This is exactly what was seen with strong rays of light
 haalanki sar ijak newton prakaash ko kanon se bana hua maanate the or unhone apane drushtikon apanaae jane ke liye bharsak prayaas kiya, dhire-dhire zyaadaatar vaigyanik maanane lage kii prakaash kii mul prakruti tarange hi hai
 In the nineteenth century, the Scottish scientist James Clerk Maxwell discovered four equations that were based on waves and which fully exposed the nature of light
 iske baad lagane laga ke prakaash vastav main vidyutchumbakeey tarang hi he
 On the contrary, the research that was being done on atoms, it seemed that the atom and its small fraction are particles
 parmaanu bhaar jaisi avadharanaayen jaise-jaise saamne ai vaise-vaise lagane laga ke vastav main parmaanu ek kan he jiske andar swayan anya chote-chote kan hi hai
 In the nineteenth century, many scientists were studying the electromagnetic radiation emanating from the black body and initially failed to make a true model of it in mathematics
 dhwani or anya tarangon main dekha jaataa he ke jab bhi kisi vastu main tarange banati hai to un tarangon kii tarangadairghy us vastu main maujuud khule sthaan par nirbhar karti he jahaan un tarangon ko banane kaa avasar miltaa he
 The sounds emanating from the flute used in music have a wavelength equal to or equal to the length of the first open hole from the flute's mouth
 ushmagatiki kaa ek siddhant he ki jo vastu ushmiya santulan main ho, usamen har sambhav urja dhaaran karne ke tareeke main saamaan str kii urja honi chahie
 In this study, dark matter was taken into thermal equilibrium and, because of its infinite loss, the energy must also appear in infinite wavelengths and be infinite
 lekin dekha gaya kii kaale padaarth se nikalati vidyutchumbakeey urja main aisa kuch nahin tha
 In 1900, the German scientist Max Planck broke this dilemma
 unhone kaha ke jab vidyutchumbakeey urja kaale padaarth ke kisi anu par padati he to vah use sokh letaa hai or ek uttejit sthiti main aa jaataa he
 When it gets enough energy, it comes back to its resting state by transmitting that energy in the form of an electromagnetic ray
 unhone parmaanu dwaara prasaarit urja ko ganit main E=hv likhaa, jisamen e urja he, v aavriti he or h ek niyatank he
 They meant that the source of the energy of dark matter is not the open space inside the dark matter located in thermal equilibrium, but the dark matter molecules that soak in energy and then release it when they come in conditions of excitation and relaxation
 
 badi aavriti kii kiran ke liye adhik urja chahie or vah tabhi chhori jaaegi jab uske baraabar kii urja sokh lee jaae
 They were found to be perfectly fine when they saw the electromagnetic energy emanating from the black material using the method of plank
 is se tahalaka much gaya, kyonki yah baat turant zaahir ho gayi ke jo uttejit anuon dwaara vidyutchumbakeey urja chodi ja rahi he unhen kiraanansh ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Until now, light was considered a wave
 usamen kanon kii pravriti dekhakar asamanjas paidaa hua kyonki iskaa arth yah bana ke prakaash kabhi kan or kabhi tarang hota he
 This twofold Planck himself was not willing to accept it and said that although his theory fits well, there is something wrong with his mathematics
 aane vaale dashakon ne dikhalaa diya ke koi aisi gadabad nahin thi
 Light actually has the form of wave-particle
 bahut se vaigyanik plank se sahamat the, ke prakaash keval tarang hi he or ve prayaas karne lage kii koi nayaa tareeqa mili jis se yah sabit ho sake
 Albert Einstein did the exact opposite
 unhone sweekaar liya ke prakaash main kanon kii bhi pravriti maujuud he or is sachai se ek purana masalaa hal karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In 1887, a German scientist named Heinrich Hertz discovered that when very short wavelength light falls on certain metals and other substances, an electric current is produced
 1901 main nicola testla ne dikhaaya ki vidyut isliye paidaa ho rahi he kyonki is prakaash se anayas hi dhaatu se electron utsarjit hote hai
 The very next year, in 1902, Philip Lennard discovered that light does not occur if it is of a large wavelength, no matter how much light is shed, while light waves with shorter wavelengths also do so
 ise prakaash vidyut prabhaav kaha jane laga or vaigyanik kai varshon tak yah samajhane main naakaam rahe ki aisa kyon hota he or kam tarangadairghy vaale prakaash se hi kyon hota he
 Einstein solved this trick with the theory of Planck
 unhone kaha ki vastav main prakaash ko uske kanon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Each particle of light contains the energy indicated in the planks, ie e = hv
 tarangadairghy or aavriti main ulta rishta hota he - bade tarangadairghy kaa matlab he ke prakaash ke kanon main aavriti kam hogi or plank niyam ke anusaar urja bhi kam hogi
 a lower wavelength means that particles of light will have a higher frequency and energy will also be higher according to Planck's law
 unhone is aadhaar par kuch bhavishyavaaniyan kareen jo prayogshaala main bilkul thik pai gayin
 For this, Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
 maiks plank ko us se bhi pehle, 1918 main, bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 After the discovery of Einstein, it became impossible to deny that light has both particle and wave trends
 1925 ke baad prakaash ke kanon ko photone bulaayaa jane laga or yah naam ab prachlit ho chukaa he
 After the discovery and victory of Einstein, scientists gradually began to believe the wave-particle form of light, when in 1924 the French scientist Louis de Broy added another sensation to the world of physics
 unhone kaha ke na sirf prakaash, balki saare padaarth ke bhi tarang-kan dvirup hote hai or kisi bhi gatisheel padaarth ko tarang yaa kan ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 He showed from his mathematics that the wavelength of a moving particle depends on its momentum - teen saal baad electronon ke saath prayogon main bilkul yahi paaya gaya
 They are fragments of atoms and were always considered particles, but when the electron beam was thrown on a screen, they showed images of diffraction with waves, just like strong light
 unki is khoj ke liye da broai ko 1929 main bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 In 1927, the German scientist Werner Heisenberg published his uncertainty principle in which he said that it can never be said with absolute certainty where an object is located or what its motion is
 unhone spasht kiya kii yah kisi maapdand main kami kii vajah se nahin he, balki prakruti main hi aisa niyam he
 Just as a wave cannot be said about where it is located, in the same way it cannot be said about objects
 jitani choti vastu hogi uske akar ke hisaab se utani hi anischitata adhik hogi
 He wrote it in mathematics like this - jahaan This uncertainty principle soon became an important part of the foundation of quantum mechanics, and it also contained the identification of the wave-particle form of matter
